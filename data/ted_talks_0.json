[{"title": "Do schools kill creativity?", "duration": "1164", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/ken_robinson_says_schools_kill_creativity", "transcript": "Good morning. How are you?(Laughter)It's been great, hasn't it? I've been blown away by the whole thing. In fact, I'm leaving.(Laughter)There have been three themes running through the conference which are relevant to what I want to talk about. One is the extraordinary evidence of human creativity in all of the presentations that we've had and in all of the people here. Just the variety of it and the range of it. The second is that it's put us in a place where we have no idea what's going to happen, in terms of the future. No idea how this may play out.I have an interest in education. Actually, what I find is everybody has an interest in education. Don't you? I find this very interesting. If you're at a dinner party, and you say you work in education \u2014 Actually, you're not often at dinner parties, frankly.(Laughter)If you work in education, you're not asked.(Laughter)And you're never asked back, curiously. That's strange to me. But if you are, and you say to somebody, you know, they say, \"What do you do?\" and you say you work in education, you can see the blood run from their face. They're like, \"Oh my God,\" you know, \"Why me?\"(Laughter)\"My one night out all week.\"(Laughter)But if you ask about their education, they pin you to the wall. Because it's one of those things that goes deep with people, am I right? Like religion, and money and other things. So I have a big interest in education, and I think we all do. We have a huge vested interest in it, partly because it's education that's meant to take us into this future that we can't grasp. If you think of it, children starting school this year will be retiring in 2065. Nobody has a clue, despite all the expertise that's been on parade for the past four days, what the world will look like in five years' time. And yet we're meant to be educating them for it. So the unpredictability, I think, is extraordinary.And the third part of this is that we've all agreed, nonetheless, on the really extraordinary capacities that children have \u2014 their capacities for innovation. I mean, Sirena last night was a marvel, wasn't she? Just seeing what she could do. And she's exceptional, but I think she's not, so to speak, exceptional in the whole of childhood. What you have there is a person of extraordinary dedication who found a talent. And my contention is, all kids have tremendous talents. And we squander them, pretty ruthlessly.So I want to talk about education and I want to talk about creativity. My contention is that creativity now is as important in education as literacy, and we should treat it with the same status.(Applause) Thank you.(Applause)That was it, by the way. Thank you very much.(Laughter)So, 15 minutes left.(Laughter)Well, I was born... no.(Laughter)I heard a great story recently \u2014 I love telling it \u2014 of a little girl who was in a drawing lesson. She was six, and she was at the back, drawing, and the teacher said this girl hardly ever paid attention, and in this drawing lesson, she did. The teacher was fascinated. She went over to her, and she said, \"What are you drawing?\" And the girl said, \"I'm drawing a picture of God.\" And the teacher said, \"But nobody knows what God looks like.\" And the girl said, \"They will, in a minute.\"(Laughter)When my son was four in England \u2014 Actually, he was four everywhere, to be honest.(Laughter)If we're being strict about it, wherever he went, he was four that year. He was in the Nativity play. Do you remember the story?(Laughter)No, it was big, it was a big story. Mel Gibson did the sequel, you may have seen it.(Laughter)\"Nativity II.\" But James got the part of Joseph, which we were thrilled about. We considered this to be one of the lead parts. We had the place crammed full of agents in T-shirts: \"James Robinson IS Joseph!\" (Laughter) He didn't have to speak, but you know the bit where the three kings come in? They come in bearing gifts, gold, frankincense and myrrh. This really happened. We were sitting there and I think they just went out of sequence, because we talked to the little boy afterward and we said, \"You OK with that?\" And he said, \"Yeah, why? Was that wrong?\" They just switched. The three boys came in, four-year-olds with tea towels on their heads, and they put these boxes down, and the first boy said, \"I bring you gold.\" And the second boy said, \"I bring you myrrh.\" And the third boy said, \"Frank sent this.\"(Laughter)What these things have in common is that kids will take a chance. If they don't know, they'll have a go. Am I right? They're not frightened of being wrong. I don't mean to say that being wrong is the same thing as being creative. What we do know is, if you're not prepared to be wrong, you'll never come up with anything original \u2014 if you're not prepared to be wrong. And by the time they get to be adults, most kids have lost that capacity. They have become frightened of being wrong. And we run our companies like this. We stigmatize mistakes. And we're now running national education systems where mistakes are the worst thing you can make. And the result is that we are educating people out of their creative capacities.Picasso once said this, he said that all children are born artists. The problem is to remain an artist as we grow up. I believe this passionately, that we don't grow into creativity, we grow out of it. Or rather, we get educated out of it. So why is this?I lived in Stratford-on-Avon until about five years ago. In fact, we moved from Stratford to Los Angeles. So you can imagine what a seamless transition that was.(Laughter)Actually, we lived in a place called Snitterfield, just outside Stratford, which is where Shakespeare's father was born. Are you struck by a new thought? I was. You don't think of Shakespeare having a father, do you? Do you? Because you don't think of Shakespeare being a child, do you? Shakespeare being seven? I never thought of it. I mean, he was seven at some point. He was in somebody's English class, wasn't he?(Laughter)How annoying would that be?(Laughter)\"Must try harder.\"(Laughter)Being sent to bed by his dad, you know, to Shakespeare, \"Go to bed, now! And put the pencil down.\"(Laughter)\"And stop speaking like that.\"(Laughter)\"It's confusing everybody.\"(Laughter)Anyway, we moved from Stratford to Los Angeles, and I just want to say a word about the transition. My son didn't want to come. I've got two kids; he's 21 now, my daughter's 16. He didn't want to come to Los Angeles. He loved it, but he had a girlfriend in England. This was the love of his life, Sarah. He'd known her for a month.(Laughter)Mind you, they'd had their fourth anniversary, because it's a long time when you're 16. He was really upset on the plane, he said, \"I'll never find another girl like Sarah.\" And we were rather pleased about that, frankly \u2014(Laughter)Because she was the main reason we were leaving the country.(Laughter)But something strikes you when you move to America and travel around the world: Every education system on Earth has the same hierarchy of subjects. Every one. Doesn't matter where you go. You'd think it would be otherwise, but it isn't. At the top are mathematics and languages, then the humanities, and at the bottom are the arts. Everywhere on Earth. And in pretty much every system too, there's a hierarchy within the arts. Art and music are normally given a higher status in schools than drama and dance. There isn't an education system on the planet that teaches dance everyday to children the way we teach them mathematics. Why? Why not? I think this is rather important. I think math is very important, but so is dance. Children dance all the time if they're allowed to, we all do. We all have bodies, don't we? Did I miss a meeting?(Laughter)Truthfully, what happens is, as children grow up, we start to educate them progressively from the waist up. And then we focus on their heads. And slightly to one side.If you were to visit education, as an alien, and say \"What's it for, public education?\" I think you'd have to conclude, if you look at the output, who really succeeds by this, who does everything that they should, who gets all the brownie points, who are the winners \u2014 I think you'd have to conclude the whole purpose of public education throughout the world is to produce university professors. Isn't it? They're the people who come out the top. And I used to be one, so there.(Laughter)And I like university professors, but you know, we shouldn't hold them up as the high-water mark of all human achievement. They're just a form of life, another form of life. But they're rather curious, and I say this out of affection for them. There's something curious about professors in my experience \u2014 not all of them, but typically, they live in their heads. They live up there, and slightly to one side. They're disembodied, you know, in a kind of literal way. They look upon their body as a form of transport for their heads.(Laughter)Don't they? It's a way of getting their head to meetings.(Laughter)If you want real evidence of out-of-body experiences, get yourself along to a residential conference of senior academics, and pop into the discotheque on the final night.(Laughter)And there, you will see it. Grown men and women writhing uncontrollably, off the beat.(Laughter)Waiting until it ends so they can go home and write a paper about it.(Laughter)Our education system is predicated on the idea of academic ability. And there's a reason. Around the world, there were no public systems of education, really, before the 19th century. They all came into being to meet the needs of industrialism. So the hierarchy is rooted on two ideas.Number one, that the most useful subjects for work are at the top. So you were probably steered benignly away from things at school when you were a kid, things you liked, on the grounds that you would never get a job doing that. Is that right? Don't do music, you're not going to be a musician; don't do art, you won't be an artist. Benign advice \u2014 now, profoundly mistaken. The whole world is engulfed in a revolution.And the second is academic ability, which has really come to dominate our view of intelligence, because the universities designed the system in their image. If you think of it, the whole system of public education around the world is a protracted process of university entrance. And the consequence is that many highly-talented, brilliant, creative people think they're not, because the thing they were good at at school wasn't valued, or was actually stigmatized. And I think we can't afford to go on that way.In the next 30 years, according to UNESCO, more people worldwide will be graduating through education than since the beginning of history. More people, and it's the combination of all the things we've talked about \u2014 technology and its transformation effect on work, and demography and the huge explosion in population.Suddenly, degrees aren't worth anything. Isn't that true? When I was a student, if you had a degree, you had a job. If you didn't have a job, it's because you didn't want one. And I didn't want one, frankly. (Laughter) But now kids with degrees are often heading home to carry on playing video games, because you need an MA where the previous job required a BA, and now you need a PhD for the other. It's a process of academic inflation. And it indicates the whole structure of education is shifting beneath our feet. We need to radically rethink our view of intelligence.We know three things about intelligence. One, it's diverse. We think about the world in all the ways that we experience it. We think visually, we think in sound, we think kinesthetically. We think in abstract terms, we think in movement. Secondly, intelligence is dynamic. If you look at the interactions of a human brain, as we heard yesterday from a number of presentations, intelligence is wonderfully interactive. The brain isn't divided into compartments. In fact, creativity \u2014 which I define as the process of having original ideas that have value \u2014 more often than not comes about through the interaction of different disciplinary ways of seeing things.By the way, there's a shaft of nerves that joins the two halves of the brain called the corpus callosum. It's thicker in women. Following off from Helen yesterday, this is probably why women are better at multi-tasking. Because you are, aren't you? There's a raft of research, but I know it from my personal life. If my wife is cooking a meal at home \u2014 which is not often, thankfully.(Laughter)No, she's good at some things, but if she's cooking, she's dealing with people on the phone, she's talking to the kids, she's painting the ceiling, she's doing open-heart surgery over here. If I'm cooking, the door is shut, the kids are out, the phone's on the hook, if she comes in I get annoyed. I say, \"Terry, please, I'm trying to fry an egg in here.\"(Laughter)\"Give me a break.\"(Laughter)Actually, do you know that old philosophical thing, if a tree falls in a forest and nobody hears it, did it happen? Remember that old chestnut? I saw a great t-shirt recently, which said, \"If a man speaks his mind in a forest, and no woman hears him, is he still wrong?\"(Laughter)And the third thing about intelligence is, it's distinct. I'm doing a new book at the moment called \"Epiphany,\" which is based on a series of interviews with people about how they discovered their talent. I'm fascinated by how people got to be there. It's really prompted by a conversation I had with a wonderful woman who maybe most people have never heard of, Gillian Lynne. Have you heard of her? Some have. She's a choreographer, and everybody knows her work. She did \"Cats\" and \"Phantom of the Opera.\" She's wonderful. I used to be on the board of The Royal Ballet, as you can see. Anyway, Gillian and I had lunch one day and I said, \"How did you get to be a dancer?\" It was interesting. When she was at school, she was really hopeless. And the school, in the '30s, wrote to her parents and said, \"We think Gillian has a learning disorder.\" She couldn't concentrate; she was fidgeting. I think now they'd say she had ADHD. Wouldn't you? But this was the 1930s, and ADHD hadn't been invented at this point. It wasn't an available condition.(Laughter)People weren't aware they could have that.(Laughter)Anyway, she went to see this specialist. So, this oak-paneled room, and she was there with her mother, and she was led and sat on this chair at the end, and she sat on her hands for 20 minutes while this man talked to her mother about the problems Gillian was having at school. Because she was disturbing people; her homework was always late; and so on, little kid of eight. In the end, the doctor went and sat next to Gillian, and said, \"I've listened to all these things your mother's told me, I need to speak to her privately. Wait here. We'll be back; we won't be very long,\" and they went and left her.But as they went out of the room, he turned on the radio that was sitting on his desk. And when they got out, he said to her mother, \"Just stand and watch her.\" And the minute they left the room, she was on her feet, moving to the music. And they watched for a few minutes and he turned to her mother and said, \"Mrs. Lynne, Gillian isn't sick; she's a dancer. Take her to a dance school.\"I said, \"What happened?\" She said, \"She did. I can't tell you how wonderful it was. We walked in this room and it was full of people like me. People who couldn't sit still. People who had to move to think.\" Who had to move to think. They did ballet, they did tap, jazz; they did modern; they did contemporary. She was eventually auditioned for the Royal Ballet School; she became a soloist; she had a wonderful career at the Royal Ballet. She eventually graduated from the Royal Ballet School, founded the Gillian Lynne Dance Company, met Andrew Lloyd Webber. She's been responsible for some of the most successful musical theater productions in history, she's given pleasure to millions, and she's a multi-millionaire. Somebody else might have put her on medication and told her to calm down.(Applause)What I think it comes to is this: Al Gore spoke the other night about ecology and the revolution that was triggered by Rachel Carson. I believe our only hope for the future is to adopt a new conception of human ecology, one in which we start to reconstitute our conception of the richness of human capacity. Our education system has mined our minds in the way that we strip-mine the earth: for a particular commodity. And for the future, it won't serve us. We have to rethink the fundamental principles on which we're educating our children.There was a wonderful quote by Jonas Salk, who said, \"If all the insects were to disappear from the Earth, within 50 years all life on Earth would end. If all human beings disappeared from the Earth, within 50 years all forms of life would flourish.\" And he's right.What TED celebrates is the gift of the human imagination. We have to be careful now that we use this gift wisely and that we avert some of the scenarios that we've talked about. And the only way we'll do it is by seeing our creative capacities for the richness they are and seeing our children for the hope that they are. And our task is to educate their whole being, so they can face this future. By the way \u2014 we may not see this future, but they will. And our job is to help them make something of it.Thank you very much.(Applause)", "id": 66, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:11.958 --> 00:00:16.636\nGood morning.

--> 00:03:31.501\n(Laughter)\n\n00:03:31.525 --> 00:03:34.270\nI heard a great story recently\n-- I love telling it --\n\n00:03:34.294 --> 00:03:37.009\nof a little girl\nwho was in a drawing lesson.\n\n00:03:37.033 --> 00:03:39.168\nShe was six, and she was\nat the back, drawing,\n\n00:03:39.192 --> 00:03:41.992\nand the teacher said this girl\nhardly ever paid attention,\n\n00:03:42.016 --> 00:03:43.802\nand in this drawing lesson, she did.\n\n00:03:43.826 --> 00:03:45.166\nThe teacher was fascinated.\n\n00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:47.952\nShe went over to her,\nand she said, \"What are

And it's truly a great honor to have the opportunity to come to this stage twice; I'm extremely grateful. I have been blown away by this conference, and I want to thank all of you for the many nice comments about what I had to say the other night. And I say that sincerely, partly because (Mock sob) I need that.(Laughter)Put yourselves in my position.(Laughter)I flew on Air Force Two for eight years.(Laughter)Now I have to take off my shoes or boots to get on an airplane!(Laughter)(Applause)I'll tell you one quick story to illustrate what that's been like for me.(Laughter)It's a true story \u2014 every bit of this is true.Soon after Tipper and I left the \u2014 (Mock sob) White House \u2014(Laughter)we were driving from our home in Nashville to a little farm we have 50 miles east of Nashville. Driving ourselves.(Laughter)I know it sounds like a little thing to you, but \u2014(Laughter)I looked in the rear-view mirror and all of a sudden it just hit me. There was no motorcade back there.(Laughter)You've heard of phantom limb pain?(Laughter)This was a rented Ford Taurus.(Laughter)It was dinnertime, and we started looking for a place to eat. We were on I-40. We got to Exit 238, Lebanon, Tennessee. We got off the exit, we found a Shoney's restaurant. Low-cost family restaurant chain, for those of you who don't know it. We went in and sat down at the booth, and the waitress came over, made a big commotion over Tipper.(Laughter)She took our order, and then went to the couple in the booth next to us, and she lowered her voice so much, I had to really strain to hear what she was saying. And she said \"Yes, that's former Vice President Al Gore and his wife, Tipper.\" And the man said, \"He's come down a long way, hasn't he?\"(Laughter)(Applause)There's been kind of a series of epiphanies.(Laughter)The very next day, continuing the totally true story, I got on a G-V to fly to Africa to make a speech in Nigeria, in the city of Lagos, on the topic of energy. And I began the speech by telling them the story of what had just happened the day before in Nashville. And I told it pretty much the same way I've just shared it with you: Tipper and I were driving ourselves, Shoney's, low-cost family restaurant chain, what the man said \u2014 they laughed. I gave my speech, then went back out to the airport to fly back home. I fell asleep on the plane until, during the middle of the night, we landed on the Azores Islands for refueling. I woke up, they opened the door, I went out to get some fresh air, and I looked, and there was a man running across the runway. And he was waving a piece of paper, and he was yelling, \"Call Washington! Call Washington!\" And I thought to myself, in the middle of the night, in the middle of the Atlantic, what in the world could be wrong in Washington? Then I remembered it could be a bunch of things.(Laughter)But what it turned out to be, was that my staff was extremely upset because one of the wire services in Nigeria had already written a story about my speech, and it had already been printed in cities all across the United States of America. It was printed in Monterey, I checked.(Laughter)And the story began, \"Former Vice President Al Gore announced in Nigeria yesterday,\" quote: 'My wife Tipper and I have opened a low-cost family restaurant'\" \u2014(Laughter)\"'named Shoney's, and we are running it ourselves.'\"(Laughter)Before I could get back to U.S. soil, David Letterman and Jay Leno had already started in on \u2014 one of them had me in a big white chef's hat, Tipper was saying, \"One more burger with fries!\"(Laughter)Three days later, I got a nice, long, handwritten letter from my friend and partner and colleague Bill Clinton, saying, \"Congratulations on the new restaurant, Al!\"(Laughter)We like to celebrate each other's successes in life.(Laughter)I was going to talk about information ecology. But I was thinking that, since I plan to make a lifelong habit of coming back to TED, that maybe I could talk about that another time.(Applause)Chris Anderson: It's a deal!(Applause)Al Gore: I want to focus on what many of you have said you would like me to elaborate on: What can you do about the climate crisis? I want to start with a couple of \u2014 I'm going to show some new images, and I'm going to recapitulate just four or five. Now, the slide show. I update the slide show every time I give it. I add new images, because I learn more about it every time I give it. It's like beach-combing, you know? Every time the tide comes in and out, you find some more shells. Just in the last two days, we got the new temperature records in January. This is just for the United States of America. Historical average for Januarys is 31 degrees; last month was 39.5 degrees.Now, I know that you wanted some more bad news about the environment \u2014 I'm kidding. But these are the recapitulation slides, and then I'm going to go into new material about what you can do. But I wanted to elaborate on a couple of these. First of all, this is where we're projected to go with the U.S. contribution to global warming, under business as usual. Efficiency in end-use electricity and end-use of all energy is the low-hanging fruit. Efficiency and conservation \u2014 it's not a cost; it's a profit. The sign is wrong. It's not negative; it's positive. These are investments that pay for themselves. But they are also very effective in deflecting our path.Cars and trucks \u2014 I talked about that in the slideshow, but I want you to put it in perspective. It's an easy, visible target of concern \u2014 and it should be \u2014 but there is more global warming pollution that comes from buildings than from cars and trucks. Cars and trucks are very significant, and we have the lowest standards in the world. And so we should address that. But it's part of the puzzle. Other transportation efficiency is as important as cars and trucks. Renewables at the current levels of technological efficiency can make this much difference. And with what Vinod, and John Doerr and others, many of you here \u2014 there are a lot of people directly involved in this \u2014 this wedge is going to grow much more rapidly than the current projection shows it. Carbon Capture and Sequestration \u2014 that's what CCS stands for \u2014 is likely to become the killer app that will enable us to continue to use fossil fuels in a way that is safe. Not quite there yet. OK. Now, what can you do?Reduce emissions in your home. Most of these expenditures are also profitable. Insulation, better design. Buy green electricity where you can. I mentioned automobiles \u2014 buy a hybrid. Use light rail. Figure out some of the other options that are much better. It's important.Be a green consumer. You have choices with everything you buy, between things that have a harsh effect, or a much less harsh effect on the global climate crisis. Consider this: Make a decision to live a carbon-neutral life. Those of you who are good at branding, I'd love to get your advice and help on how to say this in a way that connects with the most people. It is easier than you think. It really is. A lot of us in here have made that decision, and it is really pretty easy. It means reduce your carbon dioxide emissions with the full range of choices that you make, and then purchase or acquire offsets for the remainder that you have not completely reduced. And what it means is elaborated at climatecrisis.net.There is a carbon calculator. Participant Productions convened \u2014 with my active involvement \u2014 the leading software writers in the world, on this arcane science of carbon calculation, to construct a consumer-friendly carbon calculator. You can very precisely calculate what your CO2 emissions are, and then you will be given options to reduce. And by the time the movie comes out in May, this will be updated to 2.0, and we will have click-through purchases of offsets.Next, consider making your business carbon-neutral. Again, some of us have done that, and it's not as hard as you think. Integrate climate solutions into all of your innovations, whether you are from the technology, or entertainment, or design and architecture community. Invest sustainably. Majora mentioned this. Listen, if you have invested money with managers who you compensate on the basis of their annual performance, don't ever again complain about quarterly report CEO management. Over time, people do what you pay them to do. And if they judge how much they're going to get paid on your capital that they've invested, based on the short-term returns, you're going to get short-term decisions. A lot more to be said about that.Become a catalyst of change. Teach others, learn about it, talk about it. The movie is a movie version of the slideshow I gave two nights ago, except it's a lot more entertaining. And it comes out in May. Many of you here have the opportunity to ensure that a lot of people see it. Consider sending somebody to Nashville. Pick well. And I am personally going to train people to give this slideshow \u2014 re-purposed, with some of the personal stories obviously replaced with a generic approach, and it's not just the slides, it's what they mean. And it's how they link together. And so I'm going to be conducting a course this summer for a group of people that are nominated by different folks to come and then give it en masse, in communities all across the country, and we're going to update the slideshow for all of them every single week, to keep it right on the cutting edge. Working with Larry Lessig, it will be, somewhere in that process, posted with tools and limited-use copyrights, so that young people can remix it and do it in their own way.(Applause)Where did anybody get the idea that you ought to stay arm's length from politics? It doesn't mean that if you're a Republican, that I'm trying to convince you to be a Democrat. We need Republicans as well. This used to be a bipartisan issue, and I know that in this group it really is. Become politically active. Make our democracy work the way it's supposed to work. Support the idea of capping carbon dioxide emissions \u2014 global warming pollution \u2014 and trading it. Here's why: as long as the United States is out of the world system, it's not a closed system. Once it becomes a closed system, with U.S. participation, then everybody who's on a board of directors \u2014 how many people here serve on the board of directors of a corporation? Once it's a closed system, you will have legal liability if you do not urge your CEO to get the maximum income from reducing and trading the carbon emissions that can be avoided. The market will work to solve this problem \u2014 if we can accomplish this. Help with the mass persuasion campaign that will start this spring. We have to change the minds of the American people. Because presently, the politicians do not have permission to do what needs to be done.And in our modern country, the role of logic and reason no longer includes mediating between wealth and power the way it once did. It's now repetition of short, hot-button, 30-second, 28-second television ads. We have to buy a lot of those ads. Let's re-brand global warming, as many of you have suggested. I like \"climate crisis\" instead of \"climate collapse,\" but again, those of you who are good at branding, I need your help on this. Somebody said the test we're facing now, a scientist told me, is whether the combination of an opposable thumb and a neocortex is a viable combination.(Laughter)That's really true.I said the other night, and I'll repeat now: this is not a political issue. Again, the Republicans here \u2014 this shouldn't be partisan. You have more influence than some of us who are Democrats do. This is an opportunity. Not just this, but connected to the ideas that are here, to bring more coherence to them. We are one.Thank you very much, I appreciate it.(Applause)", "id": 1, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:15.295 --> 00:00:16.486\nThank you so much,

phantom limb pain?\n\n00:02:03.508 --> 00:02:08.320\n(Laughter)\n\n00:02:08.344 --> 00:02:12.560\nThis was a rented Ford Taurus.\n\n00:02:12.584 --> 00:02:15.088\n(Laughter)\n\n00:02:15.112 --> 00:02:17.118\nIt was dinnertime,\n\n00:02:17.142 --> 00:02:20.062\nand we started looking for a place to eat.\n\n00:02:20.546 --> 00:02:21.951\nWe were on I-40.\n\n00:02:21.975 --> 00:02:25.172\nWe got to Exit 238, Lebanon, Tennessee.\n\n00:02:25.196 --> 00:02:28.884\nWe got off the exit,\nwe found a Shoney's restaurant.\n\n00:02:28.908 --> 00:02:32.947\nLow-cost family restaurant chain,\nfor those of you who don't know it.\n\n00:02:33.835 --> 00:02:38.270\nWe went in and sat down at the booth,\nand the waitress came over,\n\n00:02:38.294 --> 00:02:40.280\nmade a big commotion over Tipper.\n\n00:02:40.304 --> 00:02:42.767\n(Laughter)\n\n00:02:42.791 --> 00:02:46.211\nShe took our order, and then went\nto the couple in the booth next to us,\n\n00:02:46.235 --> 00:02:48.339\nand she lowered her voice so much,\n\n00:02:48.363 --> 00:02:51.364\nI had to really strain to hear\nwhat she was saying.\n\n00:02:51.388 --> 00:02:54.067\nAnd she said \"Yes, that's former\nVice President Al Gore\n\n00:02:54.091 --> 00:02:55.934\nand his wife, Tipper.\"\n\n00:02:55.958 --> 00:02:57.485\nAnd the man said,\n\n00:02:57.509 --> 00:02:59.701\n\"He's come down a long way, hasn't he?\"\n\n00:02:59.725 --> 00:03:04.633\n(Laughter)\n\n00:03:04.657 --> 00:03:08.934\n(Applause)\n\n00:03:08.958 --> 00:03:12.077\nThere's been kind\nof a series of epiphanies.\n\n00:03:12.101 --> 00:03:13.245\n(Laughter)\n\n00:03:13.269 --> 00:03:16.934\nThe very next day,\ncontinuing the totally true story,\n\n00:03:16.958 --> 00:03:22.934\nI got on a G-V to fly to Africa\nto make a speech in Nigeria,\n\n00:03:22.958 --> 00:03:25.814\nin the city of Lagos,\non the topic of energy.\n\n00:03:26.259 --> 00:03:30.055\nAnd I began the speech\nby telling them the story\n\n00:03:30.079 --> 00:03:32.792\nof what had just happened\nthe day before in Nashville.\n\n00:03:33.154 --> 00:03:36.460\nAnd I told it pretty much the same way\nI've just shared it with you:\n\n00:03:36.484 --> 00:03:38.222\nTipper and I were driving ourselves,\n\n00:03:38.246 --> 00:03:40.284\nShoney's, low-cost\nfamily restaurant chain,\n\n00:03:40.308 --> 00:03:42.241\nwhat the man said -- they laughed.\n\n00:03:42.661 --> 00:03:46.244\nI gave my speech, then went back\nout to the airport to fly back home.\n\n00:03:46.268 --> 00:03:48.134\nI fell asleep on the plane\n\n00:03:48.158 --> 00:03:50.696\nuntil, during the middle\nof the night, we landed\n\n00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:52.934\non the Azores Islands for refueling.\n\n00:03:53.322 --> 00:03:56.434\nI woke up, they opened the door,\nI went out to get some fresh air,\n\n00:03:56.458 --> 00:03:59.934\nand I looked, and there was a man\nrunning across the runway.\n\n00:03:59.958 --> 00:04:03.013\nAnd he was waving a piece\nof paper, and he was yelling,\n\n00:04:03.037 --> 00:04:07.111\n\"Call Washington! Call Washington!\"\n\n00:04:07.939 --> 00:04:10.384\nAnd I thought to myself,\nin the middle of the night,\n\n00:04:10.408 --> 00:04:11.844\nin the middle of the Atlantic,\n\n00:04:11.868 --> 00:04:14.088\nwhat in the world could be\nwrong in Washington?\n\n00:04:14.112 --> 00:04:16.373\nThen I remembered\nit could be a bunch of things.\n\n00:04:16.397 --> 00:04:21.934\n(Laughter)\n\n00:04:21.958 --> 00:04:23.885\nBut what it turned out to be,\n\n00:04:23.909 --> 00:04:27.220\nwas that my staff was extremely upset\n\n00:04:27.244 --> 00:04:33.446\nbecause one of the wire services\nin Nigeria had already written a story\n\n00:04:33.470 --> 00:04:34.890\nabout my speech,\n\n00:04:34.914 --> 00:04:36.890\nand it had already been printed in cities\n\n00:04:36.914 --> 00:04:39.246\nall across the United States of America.\n\n00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:41.098\nIt was printed in Monterey, I checked.\n\n00:04:41.122 --> 00:04:42.272\n(Laughter)\n\n00:04:42.511 --> 00:04:45.172\nAnd the story began,\n\n00:04:45.196 --> 00:04:49.489\n\"Former Vice President Al Gore\nannounced in Nigeria yesterday,\" quote:\n\n00:04:49.513 --> 00:04:53.142\n'My wife Tipper and I have opened\na low-cost family restaurant'\" --\n\n00:04:53.166 --> 00:04:54.808\n(Laughter)\n\n00:04:54.832 --> 00:04:56.180\n\"'named Shoney's,\n\n00:04:56.204 --> 00:04:58.003\nand we are running it ourselves.'\"\n\n00:04:58.027 --> 00:05:01.347\n(Laughter)\n\n00:05:01.371 --> 00:05:03.529\nBefore I could get back to U.S. soil,\n\n00:05:03.553 --> 00:05:07.667\nDavid Letterman and Jay Leno\nhad already started in on --\n\n00:05:07.691 --> 00:05:10.934\none of them had me\nin a big white chef's hat,\n\n00:05:10.958 --> 00:05:13.387\nTipper was saying,\n\"One more burger with fries!\"\n\n00:05:13.411 --> 00:05:14.458\n(Laughter)\n\n00:05:14.482 --> 00:05:15.764\nThree days later,\n\n00:05:15.788 --> 00:05:18.527\nI got a nice, long, handwritten letter\n\n00:05:18.551 --> 00:05:21.972\nfrom my friend and partner\nand colleague Bill Clinton, saying,\n\n00:05:21.996 --> 00:05:24.392\n\"Congratulations\non the new restaurant, Al!\"\n\n00:05:24.416 --> 00:05:31.089\n(Laughter)\n\n00:05:31.113 --> 00:05:34.250\nWe like to celebrate\neach other's successes in life.\n\n00:05:34.274 --> 00:05:39.671\n(Laughter)\n\n00:05:40.564 --> 00:05:43.111\nI was going to talk\nabout information ecology.\n\n00:05:43.135 --> 00:05:45.153\nBut I was thinking that,\n\n00:05:45.177 --> 00:05:48.934\nsince I plan to make a lifelong habit\nof coming back to TED,\n\n00:05:48.958 --> 00:05:51.651\nthat maybe I could talk\nabout that another time.\n\n00:05:51.675 --> 00:05:53.075\n(Applause)\n\n00:05:53.099 --> 00:05:54.496\nChris Anderson: It's a deal!\n\n00:05:54.520 --> 00:05:57.146\n(Applause)\n\n00:05:57.170 --> 00:06:01.688\nAl Gore: I want to focus\non what many of you have said\n\n00:06:01.712 --> 00:06:03.578\nyou would like me to elaborate on:\n\n00:06:03.602 --> 00:06:07.419\nWhat can you do about the climate crisis?\n\n00:06:08.275 --> 00:06:11.614\nI want to start with a couple of --\n\n00:06:11.638 --> 00:06:14.207\nI'm going to show some new images,\n\n00:06:14.231 --> 00:06:19.354\nand I'm going to recapitulate\njust four or five.\n\n00:06:20.033 --> 00:06:21.605\nNow, the slide show.\n\n00:06:21.629 --> 00:06:24.934\nI update the slide show\nevery time I give it.\n\n00:06:24.958 --> 00:06:26.195\nI add new images,\n\n00:06:26.219 --> 00:06:29.124\nbecause I learn more about it\nevery time I give it.\n\n00:06:29.781 --> 00:06:31.732\nIt's like beach-combing, you know?\n\n00:06:31.756 --> 00:06:34.934\nEvery time the tide comes in and out,\nyou find some more shells.\n\n00:06:34.958 --> 00:06:40.941\nJust in the last two days, we got\nthe new temperature records in January.\n\n00:06:40.965 --> 00:06:43.975\nThis is just for\nthe United States of America.\n\n00:06:43.999 --> 00:06:46.737\nHistorical average\nfor Januarys is 31 degrees;\n\n00:06:46.761 --> 00:06:50.445\nlast month was 39.5 degrees.\n\n00:06:50.890 --> 00:06:55.703\nNow, I know that you wanted some more\nbad news about the environment --\n\n00:06:55.727 --> 00:06:56.895\nI'm kidding.\n\n00:06:57.362 --> 00:07:00.418\nBut these are the recapitulation slides,\n\n00:07:00.442 --> 00:07:03.836\nand then I'm going to go into new\nmaterial about what you can do.\n\n00:07:03.860 --> 00:07:06.255\nBut I wanted to elaborate\non a couple of these.\n\n00:07:06.279 --> 00:07:09.590\nFirst of all, this is where\nwe're projected to go\n\n00:07:09.614 --> 00:07:11.716\nwith the U.S. contribution\nto global warming,\n\n00:07:11.740 --> 00:07:13.524\nunder business as usual.\n\n00:07:13.548 --> 00:07:18.934\nEfficiency in end-use electricity\nand end-use of all energy\n\n00:07:18.958 --> 00:07:20.582\nis the low-hanging fruit.\n\n00:07:20.606 --> 00:07:25.110\nEfficiency and conservation --\nit's not a cost; it's a profit.\n\n00:07:25.134 --> 00:07:27.811\nThe sign is wrong.\n\n00:07:27.835 --> 00:07:29.978\nIt's not negative; it's positive.\n\n00:07:30.002 --> 00:07:32.842\nThese are investments\nthat pay for themselves.\n\n00:07:32.866 --> 00:07:36.737\nBut they are also very effective\nin deflecting our path.\n\n00:07:37.578 --> 00:07:41.573\nCars and trucks -- I talked\nabout that in the slideshow,\n\n00:07:41.597 --> 00:07:44.089\nbut I want you to put it in perspective.\n\n00:07:44.851 --> 00:07:49.448\nIt's an easy, visible target of concern --\n\n00:07:49.472 --> 00:07:50.934\nand it should be --\n\n00:07:50.958 --> 00:07:55.637\nbut there is more global warming pollution\nthat comes from buildings\n\n00:07:55.661 --> 00:07:57.383\nthan from cars and trucks.\n\n00:07:57.958 --> 00:08:00.599\nCars and trucks are very significant,\n\n00:08:00.623 --> 00:08:03.208\nand we have the lowest\nstandards in the world.\n\n00:08:03.232 --> 00:08:06.258\nAnd so we should address that.\nBut it's part of the puzzle.\n\n00:08:06.282 --> 00:08:11.643\nOther transportation efficiency\nis as important as cars and trucks.\n\n00:08:11.667 --> 00:08:16.009\nRenewables at the current levels\nof technological efficiency\n\n00:08:16.033 --> 00:08:17.780\ncan make this much difference.\n\n00:08:17.804 --> 00:08:23.759\nAnd with what Vinod, and John Doerr\nand others, many of you here --\n\n00:08:23.783 --> 00:08:26.350\nthere are a lot of people\ndirectly involved in this --\n\n00:08:26.374 --> 00:08:28.906\nthis wedge is going to grow\nmuch more rapidly\n\n00:08:28.930 --> 00:08:31.117\nthan the current projection shows it.\n\n00:08:31.141 --> 00:08:36.881\nCarbon Capture and Sequestration --\nthat's what CCS stands for --\n\n00:08:36.905 --> 00:08:43.720\nis likely to become the killer app\nthat will enable us\n\n00:08:43.744 --> 00:08:50.155\nto continue to use fossil fuels\nin a way that is safe.\n\n00:08:51.417 --> 00:08:52.753\nNot quite there yet.\n\n00:08:52.777 --> 00:08:55.943\nOK. Now, what can you do?\n\n00:08:58.453 --> 00:09:00.210\nReduce emissions in your home.\n\n00:09:00.980 --> 00:09:05.178\nMost of these expenditures\nare also profitable.\n\n00:09:05.965 --> 00:09:07.934\nInsulation, better design.\n\n00:09:07.958 --> 00:09:10.647\nBuy green electricity where you can.\n\n00:09:11.394 --> 00:09:15.204\nI mentioned automobiles -- buy a hybrid.\n\n00:09:15.228 --> 00:09:16.934\nUse light rail.\n\n00:09:17.463 --> 00:09:20.245\nFigure out some of the other options\nthat are much better.\n\n00:09:20.269 --> 00:09:21.434\nIt's important.\n\n00:09:22.212 --> 00:09:23.931\nBe a green consumer.\n\n00:09:23.955 --> 00:09:26.934\nYou have choices with everything you buy,\n\n00:09:26.958 --> 00:09:30.565\nbetween things that have a harsh effect,\n\n00:09:30.589 --> 00:09:36.089\nor a much less harsh effect\non the global climate crisis.\n\n00:09:36.828 --> 00:09:38.660\nConsider this:\n\n00:09:38.684 --> 00:09:41.936\nMake a decision to live\na carbon-neutral life.\n\n00:09:42.621 --> 00:09:45.055\nThose of you who are good at branding,\n\n00:09:45.079 --> 00:09:47.551\nI'd love to get your advice and help\n\n00:09:47.575 --> 00:09:53.653\non how to say this in a way\nthat connects with the most people.\n\n00:09:53.677 --> 00:09:55.658\nIt is easier than you think.\n\n00:09:55.682 --> 00:09:56.998\nIt really is.\n\n00:09:59.181 --> 00:10:02.576\nA lot of us in here\nhave made that decision,\n\n00:10:02.600 --> 00:10:04.734\nand it is really pretty easy.\n\n00:10:04.758 --> 00:10:10.685\nIt means reduce\nyour carbon dioxide emissions\n\n00:10:10.709 --> 00:10:13.405\nwith the full range\nof choices that you make,\n\n00:10:13.429 --> 00:10:17.554\nand then purchase or acquire offsets\n\n00:10:17.578 --> 00:10:20.695\nfor the remainder that you have not\ncompletely reduced.\n\n00:10:20.719 --> 00:10:27.209\nAnd what it means is elaborated\nat climatecrisis.net.\n\n00:10:27.713 --> 00:10:30.578\nThere is a carbon calculator.\n\n00:10:31.459 --> 00:10:34.934\nParticipant Productions convened --\n\n00:10:34.958 --> 00:10:37.528\nwith my active involvement --\n\n00:10:37.552 --> 00:10:40.369\nthe leading software writers in the world,\n\n00:10:40.393 --> 00:10:43.696\non this arcane science\nof carbon calculation,\n\n00:10:43.720 --> 00:10:47.822\nto construct a consumer-friendly\ncarbon calculator.\n\n00:10:48.275 --> 00:10:54.484\nYou can very precisely calculate\nwhat your CO2 emissions are,\n\n00:10:54.508 --> 00:10:57.826\nand then you will be given\noptions to reduce.\n\n00:10:57.850 --> 00:11:01.047\nAnd by the time the movie\ncomes out in May,\n\n00:11:01.071 --> 00:11:02.934\nthis will be updated to 2.0,\n\n00:11:02.958 --> 00:11:06.392\nand we will have click-through\npurchases of offsets.\n\n00:11:06.958 --> 00:11:10.180\nNext, consider making\nyour business carbon-neutral.\n\n00:11:10.204 --> 00:11:11.812\nAgain, some of us have done that,\n\n00:11:11.836 --> 00:11:13.842\nand it's not as hard as you think.\n\n00:11:15.154 --> 00:11:19.344\nIntegrate climate solutions\ninto all of your innovations,\n\n00:11:19.368 --> 00:11:21.281\nwhether you are from the technology,\n\n00:11:21.305 --> 00:11:24.934\nor entertainment, or design\nand architecture community.\n\n00:11:24.958 --> 00:11:27.001\nInvest sustainably.\n\n00:11:27.025 --> 00:11:28.714\nMajora mentioned this.\n\n00:11:29.206 --> 00:11:35.998\nListen, if you have invested money\nwith managers who you compensate\n\n00:11:36.022 --> 00:11:38.739\non the basis of their annual performance,\n\n00:11:38.763 --> 00:11:43.675\ndon't ever again complain\nabout quarterly report CEO management.\n\n00:11:44.765 --> 00:11:47.321\nOver time, people do\nwhat you pay them to do.\n\n00:11:48.694 --> 00:11:53.387\nAnd if they judge how much\nthey're going to get paid\n\n00:11:53.411 --> 00:11:56.711\non your capital that they've invested,\n\n00:11:56.735 --> 00:11:58.678\nbased on the short-term returns,\n\n00:11:58.702 --> 00:12:01.018\nyou're going to get short-term

about it,\ntalk about it.\n\n00:12:11.221 --> 00:12:14.626\nThe movie is a movie version\nof the slideshow\n\n00:12:14.650 --> 00:12:17.569\nI gave two nights ago,\nexcept it's a lot more entertaining.\n\n00:12:18.652 --> 00:12:20.799\nAnd it comes out in May.\n\n00:12:21.395 --> 00:12:25.356\nMany of you here have the opportunity\nto ensure that a lot of people see it.\n\n00:12:27.064 --> 00:12:30.667\nConsider sending somebody to Nashville.\n\n00:12:31.348 --> 00:12:32.503\nPick well.\n\n00:12:33.339 --> 00:12:37.785\nAnd I am personally going to train people\nto give this slideshow --\n\n00:12:37.809 --> 00:12:42.564\nre-purposed, with some\nof the personal stories obviously replaced\n\n00:12:42.588 --> 00:12:44.658\nwith a generic approach,\n\n00:12:44.682 --> 00:12:47.381\nand it's not just the slides,\nit's what they mean.\n\n00:12:47.405 --> 00:12:49.006\nAnd it's how they link together.\n\n00:12:49.030 --> 00:12:53.617\nAnd so I'm going to be conducting\na course this summer\n\n00:12:53.641 --> 00:12:57.476\nfor a group of people that are\nnominated by different folks\n\n00:12:57.500 --> 00:12:59.729\nto come and then give it en

week,\n\n00:13:06.647 --> 00:13:09.678\nto keep it right on the cutting edge.\n\n00:13:09.702 --> 00:13:13.583\nWorking with Larry Lessig, it will be,\nsomewhere in that process,\n\n00:13:13.607 -->

00:13:27.104\n(Applause)\n\n00:13:27.128 --> 00:13:28.618\nWhere did anybody get the idea\n\n00:13:28.642 --> 00:13:30.994\nthat you ought to stay\narm's length from politics?\n\n00:13:31.018 --> 00:13:33.108\nIt doesn't mean\nthat if you're a Republican,\n\n00:13:33.132 --> 00:13:35.456\nthat I'm trying to convince you\nto be a Democrat.\n\n00:13:35.893 --> 00:13:37.398\nWe need Republicans as well.\n\n00:13:37.422 --> 00:13:39.431\nThis used to be a bipartisan issue,\n\n00:13:39.455 --> 00:13:41.912\nand I know that\nin this group it really is.\n\n00:13:41.936 --> 00:13:43.488\nBecome

--\n\n00:13:52.284 --> 00:13:54.299\nglobal warming pollution --\nand trading it.\n\n00:13:54.323 --> 00:13:58.934\nHere's why: as long as the United States\nis out of the world system,\n\n00:13:58.958 --> 00:14:00.626\nit's not a closed system.\n\n00:14:00.650 --> 00:14:04.697\nOnce it becomes a closed system,\nwith U.S. participation,\n\n00:14:04.721 --> 00:14:06.944\nthen

--> 00:14:13.799\nOnce it's a closed system,\n\n00:14:13.823 --> 00:14:20.060\nyou will have legal liability\nif you do not urge your CEO\n\n00:14:20.084 --> 00:14:24.211\nto get the maximum income from reducing\nand trading the carbon emissions\n\n00:14:24.235 --> 00:14:25.544\nthat can be avoided.\n\n00:14:25.568 --> 00:14:28.233\nThe market will work\nto solve this problem --\n\n00:14:30.907 --> 00:14:33.124\nif we can accomplish this.\n\n00:14:34.392 --> 00:14:37.777\nHelp with the mass persuasion campaign\nthat will start this spring.\n\n00:14:37.801 --> 00:14:40.309\nWe have to change the minds\nof the American people.\n\n00:14:40.333 --> 00:14:43.092\nBecause presently, the politicians\ndo not have permission\n\n00:14:43.116 --> 00:14:45.035\nto do what needs to be done.\n\n00:14:45.313 --> 00:14:50.767\nAnd in our modern country, the role\nof logic and reason no longer includes\n\n00:14:50.791 --> 00:14:53.745\nmediating between wealth and power\nthe way it once did.\n\n00:14:53.769 --> 00:14:59.329\nIt's now repetition of short, hot-button,\n30-second, 28-second television ads.\n\n00:14:59.353 --> 00:15:01.211\nWe have to buy a lot of those ads.\n\n00:15:02.179 --> 00:15:06.489\nLet's re-brand global warming,\nas many of you have suggested.\n\n00:15:06.513 --> 00:15:09.382\nI like \"climate crisis\"\ninstead of \"climate collapse,\"\n\n00:15:09.406 --> 00:15:11.733\nbut again, those of you\nwho are good at branding,\n\n00:15:11.757 --> 00:15:13.162\nI need your help on this.\n\n00:15:13.726 --> 00:15:17.826\nSomebody said the test\nwe're facing now, a scientist told me,\n\n00:15:17.850 --> 00:15:20.934\nis whether the combination\nof an opposable thumb\n\n00:15:20.958 --> 00:15:23.775\nand a neocortex is a viable combination.\n\n00:15:23.905 --> 00:15:25.404\n(Laughter)\n\n00:15:25.783 --> 00:15:27.340\nThat's really true.\n\n00:15:30.118 --> 00:15:33.518\nI said the other night,\nand I'll repeat now:\n\n00:15:33.542 --> 00:15:35.707\nthis is not a political issue.\n\n00:15:35.731 --> 00:15:41.270\nAgain, the Republicans here --\nthis shouldn't be partisan.\n\n00:15:41.294 --> 00:15:44.934\nYou have more influence\nthan some of us who are Democrats do.\n\n00:15:45.379 --> 00:15:46.855\nThis is an opportunity.\n\n00:15:46.879 --> 00:15:51.731\nNot just this, but connected\nto the ideas that are here,\n\n00:15:51.755 --> 00:15:53.683\nto bring more coherence to them.\n\n00:15:54.453 --> 00:15:55.619\nWe are one.\n\n00:15:56.023 --> 00:15:58.358\nThank you very much, I appreciate it.\n\n00:15:58.382 --> 00:16:04.624\n(Applause)"}, {"title": "Simplicity sells", "duration": "1286", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/david_pogue_says_simplicity_sells", "transcript": "(Music: \"The Sound of Silence,\" Simon & Garfunkel)Hello voice mail, my old friend.(Laughter)I've called for tech support again. I ignored my boss's warning. I called on a Monday morning. Now it's evening, and my dinner first grew cold, and then grew mold. I'm still on hold. I'm listening to the sounds of silence. I don't think you understand. I think your phone lines are unmanned. I punched every touch tone I was told, but I've still spent 18 hours on hold. It's not enough your software crashed my Mac, and it constantly hangs and bombs \u2014 it erased my ROMs! Now the Mac makes the sounds of silence. In my dreams I fantasize of wreaking vengeance on you guys. Say your motorcycle crashes. Blood comes gushing from your gashes. With your fading strength, you call 9-1-1 and you pray for a trained MD. But you get me.(Laughter)And you listen to the sounds of silence.(Music)(Applause)Thank you.Good evening and welcome to: \"Spot the TED Presenter Who Used to Be a Broadway Accompanist.\"(Laughter)When I was offered the Times column six years ago, the deal was like this: you'll be sent the coolest, hottest, slickest new gadgets. Every week, it'll arrive at your door. You get to try them out, play with them, evaluate them until the novelty wears out, before you have to send them back, and you'll get paid for it. You can think about it, if you want. So, I've always been a technology nut, and I absolutely love it. The job, though, came with one small downside, and that is, they intended to publish my email address at the end of every column. And what I've noticed is \u2014 first of all, you get an incredible amount of email.If you ever are feeling lonely, get a New York Times column, because you will get hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of emails. And the email I'm getting a lot today is about frustration. People are feeling like things \u2014 Ok, I just had an alarm come up on my screen. Lucky you can't see it. People are feeling overwhelmed. They're feeling like it's too much technology, too fast. It may be good technology, but I feel like there's not enough of a support structure. There's not enough help. There's not enough thought put into the design of it to make it easy and enjoyable to use. One time I wrote a column about my efforts to reach Dell Technical Support, and within 12 hours, there were 700 messages from readers on the feedback boards on the Times website, from users saying, \"\"Me too, and here's my tale of woe.\" I call it \"software rage.\" And man, let me tell you, whoever figures out how to make money off of this frustration will \u2014 Oh, how did that get up there? Just kidding.(Laughter)Ok, so why is the problem accelerating? And part of the problem is, ironically, because the industry has put so much thought into making things easier to use. I'll show you what I mean. This is what the computer interface used to look like, DOS. Over the years, it's gotten easier to use. This is the original Mac operating system. Reagan was President. Madonna was still a brunette. And the entire operating system \u2014 this is the good part \u2014 the entire operating system fit in 211 k. You couldn't put the Mac OS X logo in 211 k!(Laughter)So the irony is, that as these things became easier to use, a less technical, broader audience was coming into contact with this equipment for the first time.I once had the distinct privilege of sitting in on the Apple call center for a day. The guy had a duplicate headset for me to listen to. And the calls that \u2014 you know how they say, \"Your call may be recorded for quality assurance?\" Uh-uh. Your call may be recorded so that they can collect the funniest dumb user stories and pass them around on a CD.(Laughter)Which they do.(Laughter)And I have a copy.(Laughter)It's in your gift bag. No, no. With your voices on it!So, some of the stories are just so classic, and yet so understandable. A woman called Apple to complain that her mouse was squeaking. Making a squeaking noise. And the technician said,\"Well, ma'am, what do you mean your mouse is squeaking?\"She says, \"All I can tell you is that it squeaks louder, the faster I move it across the screen.\"(Laughter)And the technician's like, \"Ma'am, you've got the mouse up against the screen?\"She goes, \"Well, the message said, 'Click here to continue.'\"(Laughter)Well, if you like that one \u2014 how much time have we got? Another one, a guy called \u2014 this is absolutely true \u2014 his computer had crashed, and he told the technician he couldn't restart it, no matter how many times he typed \"11.\" And the technician said, \"What? Why are you typing 11?\" He said, \"The message says, 'Error Type 11.'\"(Laughter)So, we must admit that some of the blame falls squarely at the feet of the users. But why is the technical overload crisis, the complexity crisis, accelerating now?In the hardware world, it's because we the consumers want everything to be smaller, smaller, smaller. So the gadgets are getting tinier and tinier, but our fingers are essentially staying the same size. So it gets to be more and more of a challenge. Software is subject to another primal force: the mandate to release more and more versions. When you buy a piece of software, it's not like buying a vase or a candy bar, where you own it. It's more like joining a club, where you pay dues every year, and every year, they say, \"We've added more features, and we'll sell it to you for $99.\" I know one guy who's spent $4,000 just on Photoshop over the years. And software companies make 35 percent of their revenue from just these software upgrades. I call it the Software Upgrade Paradox \u2014 which is that if you improve a piece of software enough times, you eventually ruin it.I mean, Microsoft Word was last just a word processor in, you know, the Eisenhower administration.(Laughter)But what's the alternative? Microsoft actually did this experiment. They said, \"Well, wait a minute. Everyone complains that we're adding so many features. Let's create a word processor that's just a word processor: Simple, pure; does not do web pages, is not a database.\" And it came out, and it was called Microsoft Write. And none of you are nodding in acknowledgment, because it died. It tanked. No one ever bought it. I call this the Sport Utility Principle. People like to surround themselves with unnecessary power, right? They don't need the database and the website, but they're like, \"Well, I'll upgrade, because, I might, you know, I might need that someday.\" So the problem is: as you add more features, where are they going to go? Where are you going to stick them? You only have so many design tools. You can do buttons, you can do sliders, pop-up menus, sub-menus. But if you're not careful about how you choose, you wind up with this.(Laughter)This is an un-retouched \u2014 this is not a joke \u2014 un-retouched photo of Microsoft Word, the copy that you have, with all the toolbars open. You've obviously never opened all the toolbars, but all you have to type in is this little, teeny window down here.(Laughter)And we've arrived at the age of interface matrices, where there are so many features and options, you have to do two dimensions, you know: a vertical and a horizontal. You guys all complain about how Microsoft Word is always bulleting your lists and underlining your links automatically. The off switch is in there somewhere. I'm telling you \u2014 it's there. Part of the art of designing a simple, good interface, is knowing when to use which one of these features. So, here is the log-off dialogue box for Windows 2000. There are only four choices, so why are they in a pop-up menu? It's not like the rest of the screen is so full of other components that you need to collapse the choices. They could have put them all out in view.Here's Apple's take on the exact same dialogue box.(Applause)Thank you \u2014 yes, I designed the dialogue box. No, no. Already, we can see that Apple and Microsoft have a severely divergent approach to software design. Microsoft's approach to simplicity tends to be: let's break it down; let's just make it more steps. There are these \"wizards\" everywhere. And you know, there's a new version of Windows coming out this fall. If they continue at this pace, there's absolutely no telling where they might wind up.[Welcome to the Type a Word Wizard](Laughter)(Applause)\"Welcome to the Type a Word Wizard.\" Ok, I'll bite. Let's click \"Next\" to continue.(Laughter)(Applause)From the drop-down menu, choose the first letter you want to type. Ok.(Laughter)So there is a limit that we don't want to cross. So what is the answer? How do you pack in all these features in a simple, intelligent way? I believe in consistency, when possible, real-world equivalents, trash can folder, when possible, label things, mostly. But I beg of the designers here to break all those rules if they violate the biggest rule of all, which is intelligence. Now what do I mean by that? I'm going to give you some examples where intelligence makes something not consistent, but it's better.If you are buying something on the web, you're supposed to put in your address, and you're supposed to choose what country you're from, ok? There are 200 countries in the world. We like to think of the Internet as a global village. I'm sorry; it's not one yet. It's mainly like, the United States, Europe, and Japan. So why is \"United States\" in the \"U\"s?(Laughter)You have to scroll, like, seven screensful to get to it. Now, it would be inconsistent to put \"United States\" first, but it would be intelligent.This one's been touched on before, but why in God's name do you shut down a Windows PC by clicking a button called \"Start?\"(Laughter)Here's another pet one of mine: you have a printer. Most of the time, you want to print one copy of your document, in page order, on that printer. So why in God's name do you see this every time you print? It's like a 747 shuttle cockpit.(Laughter)And one of the buttons at the bottom, you'll notice, is not \"Print.\"(Laughter)(Applause)Now, I'm not saying that Apple is the only company who has embraced the cult of simplicity. Palm is also, especially in the old days, wonderful about this. I actually got to speak to Palm when they were flying high in the '90s, and after the talk, I met one of the employees. He says, \"Nice talk.\" And I said, \"Thank you. What do you do here?\" He said, \"I'm a tap counter.\" I'm like, \"You're a what?\" He goes, \"Well Jeff Hawkins, the CEO, says, 'If any task on the Palm Pilot takes more than three taps of the stylus, it's too long, and it has to be redesigned.' So I'm the tap counter.\" So, I'm going to show you an example of a company that does not have a tap counter.(Laughter)This is Microsoft Word. Ok, when you want to create a new blank document in Word \u2014 it could happen.(Laughter)You go up to the \"File\" menu and you choose \"New.\" Now, what happens when you choose \"New?\" Do you get a new blank document? You do not. On the opposite side of the monitor, a task bar appears, and somewhere in those links \u2014 by the way, not at the top \u2014 somewhere in those links is a button that makes you a new document. Ok, so that is a company not counting taps. You know, I don't want to just stand here and make fun of Microsoft ... Yes, I do.(Laughter)(Applause)The Bill Gates song!(Piano music)I've been a geek forever and I wrote the very first DOS. I put my software and IBM together; I got profit and they got the loss.(Laughter)I write the code that makes the whole world run. I'm getting royalties from everyone. Sometimes it's garbage, but the press is snowed. You buy the box; I'll sell the code. Every software company is doing Microsoft's R&D. You can't keep a good idea down these days. Even Windows is a hack. We're kind of based loosely on the Mac. So it's big, so it's slow. You've got nowhere to go. I'm not doing this for praise. I write the code that fits the world today. Big mediocrity in every way. We've entered planet domination mode. You'll have no choice; you'll buy my code. I am Bill Gates and I write the code.(Applause)But actually, I believe there are really two Microsofts. There's the old one, responsible for Windows and Office. They're dying to throw the whole thing out and start fresh, but they can't. They're locked in, because so many add-ons and other company stuff locks into the old 1982 chassis. But there's also a new Microsoft, that's really doing good, simple interface designs. I liked the Media Center PC. I liked the Microsoft SPOT Watch. The Wireless Watch flopped miserably in the market, but it wasn't because it wasn't simply and beautifully designed. But let's put it this way: would you pay $10 a month to have a watch that has to be recharged every night like your cell phone, and stops working when you leave your area code?(Laughter)So, the signs might indicate that the complexity crunch is only going to get worse. So is there any hope? The screens are getting smaller, people are illuminating, putting manuals in the boxes, things are coming out at a faster pace. It's funny \u2014 when Steve Jobs came back to Apple in 1997, after 12 years away, it was the MacWorld Expo \u2014 he came to the stage in that black turtleneck and jeans, and he sort of did this. The crowd went wild, but I had just seen \u2014 I'm like, where have I seen this before? I had just seen the movie \"Evita\" \u2014(Laughter)with Madonna, and I'm like, you know what? I've got to do one about Steve Jobs.(Music)It won't be easy. You'll think I'm strange.(Laughter)When I try to explain why I'm back, after telling the press Apple's future is black. You won't believe me. All that you see is a kid in his teens who started out in a garage with only a buddy named Woz.(Laughter)You try rhyming with garage!(Laughter)Don't cry for me, Cupertino.(Laughter)The truth is, I never left you. I know the ropes now, know what the tricks are. I made a fortune over at Pixar.(Laughter)Don't cry for me, Cupertino. I've still got the drive and vision. I still wear sandals in any weather. It's just that these days, they're Gucci leather.(Laughter)(Applause)Thank you.So Steve Jobs had always believed in simplicity and elegance and beauty. And the truth is, for years I was a little depressed, because Americans obviously did not value it, because the Mac had three percent market share, Windows had 95 percent market share \u2014 people did not think it was worth putting a price on it. So I was a little depressed. And then I heard Al Gore's talk, and I realized I didn't know the meaning of depressed.(Laughter)But it turns out I was wrong, right? Because the iPod came out, and it violated every bit of common wisdom. Other products cost less; other products had more features, they had voice recorders and FM transmitters. The other products were backed by Microsoft, with an open standard, not Apple's propriety standard. But the iPod won \u2014 this is the one they wanted. The lesson was: simplicity sells. And there are signs that the industry is getting the message. This is a little company that's done very well with simplicity and elegance. The Sonos thing \u2014 it's catching on.I've got just a couple examples. Physically, a really cool, elegant thinking coming along lately. When you have a digital camera, how do you get the pictures back to your computer? Well, you either haul around a USB cable, or you buy a card reader and haul that around. Either one, you're going to lose. What I do is, I take out the memory card, and I fold it in half, revealing USB contacts. I just stick it in the computer, offload the pictures, put it right back in the camera. I never have to lose anything. Here's another example. Chris, you're the source of all power. Will you be my power plug?Chris Anderson: Oh yeah. DP: Hold that and don't let go. You might've seen this, this is Apple's new laptop. This the power cord. It hooks on like this. And I'm sure every one of you has done this at some point in your lives, or one of your children. You walk along \u2014 and I'm about to pull this onto the floor. I don't care. It's a loaner. Here we go. Whoa! It's magnetic \u2014 it doesn't pull the laptop onto the floor.(Applause)In my very last example \u2014 I do a lot of my work using speech recognition software. And I'll just \u2014 you have to be kind of quiet because the software is nervous. Speech recognition software is really great for doing emails very quickly; period. Like, I get hundreds of them a day; period. And it's not just what I dictate that it writes down; period. I also use this feature called voice macros; period. Correct \"dissuade.\" Not \"just.\" Ok, this is not an ideal situation, because it's getting the echo from the hall and stuff. The point is, I can respond to people very quickly by saying a short word, and having it write out a much longer thing. So if somebody sends me a fan letter, I'll say, \"Thanks for that.\"[Thank you so much for taking the time to write ...](Laughter)(Applause)And conversely, if somebody sends me hate mail \u2014 which happens daily \u2014 I say, \"Piss off.\"(Laughter)[I admire your frankness ...](Laughter)(Applause)So that's my dirty little secret. Don't tell anyone.(Laughter)So the point is \u2014 this is a really interesting story. This is version eight of this software, and do you know what they put in version eight? No new features. It's never happened before in software! The company put no new features. They just said, \"We'll make this software work right.\" Right? Because for years, people had bought this software, tried it out \u2014 95 percent accuracy was all they got, which means one in 20 words is wrong \u2014 and they'd put it in their drawer. And the company got sick of that, so they said, \"This version, we're not going to do anything, but make sure it's darned accurate.\" And so that's what they did.This cult of doing things right is starting to spread. So, my final advice for those of you who are consumers of this technology: remember, if it doesn't work, it's not necessarily you, ok? It could be the design of the thing you're using. Be aware in life of good design and bad design. And if you're among the people who create this stuff: Easy is hard. Pre-sweat the details for your audience. Count the taps.

wasn't\nsimply and beautifully designed.\n\n00:14:50.732 --> 00:14:51.978\nBut let's put it this way:\n\n00:14:52.002 --> 00:14:54.493\nwould you pay $10 a month to have a watch\n\n00:14:54.517 --> 00:14:57.775\nthat has to be recharged\nevery night like your cell phone,\n\n00:14:57.799 --> 00:15:00.338\nand stops working\nwhen you leave your area code?\n\n00:15:00.362 --> 00:15:02.960\n(Laughter)\n\n00:15:02.984 --> 00:15:05.485\nSo, the signs might indicate\n\n00:15:05.509 --> 00:15:08.346\nthat the complexity crunch\nis only going to get worse.\n\n00:15:08.370 --> 00:15:10.023\nSo is there any hope?\n\n00:15:10.047 --> 00:15:12.746\nThe screens are getting smaller,\npeople are illuminating,\n\n00:15:12.770 --> 00:15:14.167\nputting manuals in the boxes,\n\n00:15:14.191 --> 00:15:16.934\nthings are coming out at a faster pace.\n\n00:15:16.958 --> 00:15:20.351\nIt's funny -- when Steve Jobs\ncame back to Apple in 1997,\n\n00:15:20.375 --> 00:15:23.200\nafter 12 years away,\nit was the MacWorld Expo --\n\n00:15:23.224 --> 00:15:26.366\nhe came to the stage\nin that black turtleneck and jeans,\n\n00:15:26.390 --> 00:15:27.542\nand he sort of did this.\n\n00:15:27.566 --> 00:15:29.934\nThe crowd went wild,\nbut I had just seen --\n\n00:15:29.958 --> 00:15:31.884\nI'm like, where have I seen this before?\n\n00:15:31.908 --> 00:15:33.717\nI had just seen the movie \"Evita\" --\n\n00:15:33.741 --> 00:15:36.826\n(Laughter)\n\n00:15:36.850 --> 00:15:38.008\nwith Madonna,\n\n00:15:38.032 --> 00:15:39.780\nand I'm like, you know what?\n\n00:15:39.804 --> 00:15:42.901\nI've got to do one about Steve Jobs.\n\n00:15:42.925 --> 00:15:43.933\n(Music)\n\n00:15:43.957 --> 00:15:46.973\nIt won't be easy.\nYou'll think I'm strange.\n\n00:15:46.997 --> 00:15:48.141\n(Laughter)\n\n00:15:48.165 --> 00:15:50.474\nWhen I try to explain why I'm back,\n\n00:15:50.498 --> 00:15:53.589\nafter telling the press\nApple's future is black.\n\n00:15:53.613 --> 00:15:56.208\nYou won't believe me.\n\n00:15:56.232 --> 00:16:00.934\nAll that you see is a kid in his teens\nwho started out in a garage\n\n00:16:00.958 --> 00:16:03.934\nwith only a buddy named Woz.\n\n00:16:03.958 --> 00:16:05.510\n(Laughter)\n\n00:16:05.534 --> 00:16:07.267\nYou try rhyming with garage!\n\n00:16:07.291 --> 00:16:09.733\n(Laughter)\n\n00:16:09.757 --> 00:16:12.632\nDon't cry for me, Cupertino.\n\n00:16:12.656 --> 00:16:13.978\n(Laughter)\n\n00:16:14.002 --> 00:16:16.934\nThe truth is, I never left you.\n\n00:16:16.958 --> 00:16:20.493\nI know the ropes now,\nknow what the tricks are.\n\n00:16:20.517 --> 00:16:23.934\nI made a fortune over at Pixar.\n\n00:16:23.958 --> 00:16:24.997\n(Laughter)\n\n00:16:25.021 --> 00:16:27.672\nDon't cry for me, Cupertino.\n\n00:16:28.140 --> 00:16:31.453\nI've still got the drive and vision.\n\n00:16:31.477 --> 00:16:34.929\nI still wear sandals in any weather.\n\n00:16:34.953 --> 00:16:36.934\nIt's just that these days,\n\n00:16:36.958 --> 00:16:38.934\nthey're Gucci leather.\n\n00:16:38.958 --> 00:16:40.934\n(Laughter)\n\n00:16:40.958 --> 00:16:47.866\n(Applause)\n\n00:16:48.216 --> 00:16:49.374\nThank you.\n\n00:16:49.773 --> 00:16:54.481\nSo Steve Jobs had always believed\nin simplicity and elegance and beauty.\n\n00:16:54.505 --> 00:16:56.402\nAnd the truth is,\n\n00:16:56.426 --> 00:16:58.554\nfor years I was a little depressed,\n\n00:16:58.578 --> 00:17:00.851\nbecause Americans\nobviously did not value it,\n\n00:17:00.875 --> 00:17:03.152\nbecause the Mac had\nthree percent market share,\n\n00:17:03.176 --> 00:17:05.033\nWindows had 95 percent market share --\n\n00:17:05.057 --> 00:17:07.934\npeople did not think it was worth\nputting a price on it.\n\n00:17:07.958 --> 00:17:09.749\nSo I was a little depressed.\n\n00:17:09.773 --> 00:17:11.330\nAnd then I heard Al Gore's talk,\n\n00:17:11.354 --> 00:17:13.893\nand I realized I didn't know\nthe meaning of depressed.\n\n00:17:13.917 --> 00:17:14.934\n(Laughter)\n\n00:17:14.958 --> 00:17:16.695\nBut it turns out I was wrong, right?\n\n00:17:16.719 --> 00:17:18.452\nBecause the iPod came out,\n\n00:17:18.476 --> 00:17:21.094\nand it violated every bit\nof common wisdom.\n\n00:17:21.118 --> 00:17:24.094\nOther products cost less;\nother products had more features,\n\n00:17:24.118 --> 00:17:26.855\nthey had voice recorders\nand FM transmitters.\n\n00:17:26.879 --> 00:17:30.101\nThe other products were backed\nby Microsoft, with an open standard,\n\n00:17:30.125 --> 00:17:31.839\nnot Apple's propriety standard.\n\n00:17:31.863 --> 00:17:34.435\nBut the iPod won --\nthis is the one they wanted.\n\n00:17:34.459 --> 00:17:36.722\nThe lesson was: simplicity sells.\n\n00:17:36.746 --> 00:17:39.620\nAnd there are signs that the industry\nis getting the message.\n\n00:17:39.644 --> 00:17:43.235\nThis is a little company that's done\nvery well with simplicity and elegance.\n\n00:17:43.259 --> 00:17:44.998\nThe Sonos thing -- it's catching on.\n\n00:17:45.022 --> 00:17:46.720\nI've got just a couple examples.\n\n00:17:46.744 --> 00:17:50.420\nPhysically, a really cool,\nelegant thinking coming along lately.\n\n00:17:50.444 --> 00:17:52.397\nWhen you have a digital camera,\n\n00:17:52.421 --> 00:17:55.664\nhow do you get the pictures\nback to your computer?\n\n00:17:55.688 --> 00:17:58.030\nWell, you either haul around a USB cable,\n\n00:17:58.054 --> 00:18:00.210\nor you buy a card reader\nand haul that around.\n\n00:18:00.234 --> 00:18:01.821\nEither one, you're going to lose.\n\n00:18:01.845 --> 00:18:04.304\nWhat I do is, I take out the memory card,\n\n00:18:04.328 --> 00:18:09.673\nand I fold it in half,\nrevealing USB contacts.\n\n00:18:09.697 --> 00:18:12.355\nI just stick it in the computer,\noffload the pictures,\n\n00:18:12.379 --> 00:18:13.918\nput it right back in the camera.\n\n00:18:13.942 --> 00:18:15.742\nI never have to lose anything.\n\n00:18:15.766 --> 00:18:17.303\nHere's another example.\n\n00:18:17.327 --> 00:18:20.397\nChris, you're the source of all power.\nWill you be my power plug?\n\n00:18:20.421 --> 00:18:23.161\nChris Anderson: Oh yeah.\nDP: Hold that and don't let go.\n\n00:18:23.185 --> 00:18:25.606\nYou might've seen this,\nthis is Apple's new laptop.\n\n00:18:25.630 --> 00:18:27.654\nThis the power cord.\nIt hooks on like this.\n\n00:18:27.678 --> 00:18:31.075\nAnd I'm sure every one of you has done\nthis at some point in your lives,\n\n00:18:31.099 --> 00:18:32.274\nor one of your children.\n\n00:18:32.298 --> 00:18:35.123\nYou walk along -- and I'm\nabout to pull this onto the floor.\n\n00:18:35.147 --> 00:18:36.483\nI don't care. It's a loaner.\n\n00:18:36.507 --> 00:18:37.690\nHere we go. Whoa!\n\n00:18:37.714 --> 00:18:40.783\nIt's magnetic -- it doesn't pull\nthe laptop onto the floor.\n\n00:18:40.807 --> 00:18:44.934\n(Applause)\n\n00:18:44.958 --> 00:18:46.927\nIn my very last example --\n\n00:18:46.951 --> 00:18:50.927\nI do a lot of my work\nusing speech recognition software.\n\n00:18:50.951 --> 00:18:53.181\nAnd I'll just --\nyou have to be kind of quiet\n\n00:18:53.205 --> 00:18:54.808\nbecause the software is nervous.\n\n00:18:55.482 --> 00:18:57.562\nSpeech recognition\nsoftware is really great\n\n00:18:57.586 --> 00:19:00.116\nfor doing emails very quickly; period.\n\n00:19:00.140 --> 00:19:02.779\nLike, I get hundreds of them\na day; period.\n\n00:19:02.803 --> 00:19:06.094\nAnd it's not just what I dictate\nthat it writes down; period.\n\n00:19:06.118 --> 00:19:09.308\nI also use this feature\ncalled voice macros; period.\n\n00:19:10.878 --> 00:19:12.060\nCorrect \"dissuade.\"\n\n00:19:15.957 --> 00:19:17.111\nNot \"just.\"\n\n00:19:19.206 --> 00:19:20.888\nOk, this is not an ideal situation,\n\n00:19:20.912 --> 00:19:23.451\nbecause it's getting the echo\nfrom the hall and stuff.\n\n00:19:23.475 --> 00:19:27.711\nThe point is, I can respond to people\nvery quickly by saying a short word,\n\n00:19:27.735 --> 00:19:29.807\nand having it write out\na much longer thing.\n\n00:19:29.831 --> 00:19:32.197\nSo if somebody\nsends me a fan letter, I'll say,\n\n00:19:32.221 --> 00:19:33.378\n\"Thanks for that.\"\n\n00:19:33.402 --> 00:19:35.909\n[Thank you so much\nfor taking the time to write ...]\n\n00:19:35.933 --> 00:19:36.934\n(Laughter)\n\n00:19:36.958 --> 00:19:39.934\n(Applause)\n\n00:19:39.958 --> 00:19:44.396\nAnd conversely, if somebody\nsends me hate mail --\n\n00:19:44.420 --> 00:19:46.722\nwhich happens daily --\n\n00:19:46.746 --> 00:19:48.798\nI say, \"Piss off.\"\n\n00:19:51.466 --> 00:19:52.783\n(Laughter)\n\n00:19:52.807 --> 00:19:55.279\n[I admire your frankness ...]\n\n00:19:55.303 --> 00:19:56.934\n(Laughter)\n\n00:19:56.958 --> 00:20:02.311\n(Applause)\n\n00:20:02.335 --> 00:20:04.934\nSo that's my dirty little secret.\nDon't tell anyone.\n\n00:20:04.958 --> 00:20:06.073\n(Laughter)\n\n00:20:06.097 --> 00:20:08.934\nSo the point is --\nthis is a really interesting story.\n\n00:20:08.958 --> 00:20:10.836\nThis is version eight of this software,\n\n00:20:10.860 --> 00:20:13.058\nand do you know what they put\nin version eight?\n\n00:20:13.082 --> 00:20:16.144\nNo new features. It's never\nhappened before in software!\n\n00:20:16.168 --> 00:20:17.899\nThe company put no new features.\n\n00:20:17.923 --> 00:20:21.538\nThey just said, \"We'll make\nthis software work right.\" Right?\n\n00:20:21.562 --> 00:20:24.778\nBecause for years, people had bought\nthis software, tried it out --\n\n00:20:24.802 --> 00:20:26.603\n95 percent accuracy was all they got,\n\n00:20:26.627 --> 00:20:28.523\nwhich means one in 20 words is wrong --\n\n00:20:28.547 --> 00:20:30.174\nand they'd put it in their drawer.\n\n00:20:30.198 --> 00:20:31.778\nAnd the company got sick of that,\n\n00:20:31.802 --> 00:20:34.638\nso they said, \"This version,\nwe're not going to do anything,\n\n00:20:34.662 --> 00:20:36.395\nbut make sure it's darned accurate.\"\n\n00:20:36.419 --> 00:20:37.768\nAnd so that's what they did.\n\n00:20:37.792 --> 00:20:40.380\nThis cult of doing things right\nis starting to spread.\n\n00:20:40.404 --> 00:20:43.900\nSo, my final advice for those of you\nwho are consumers of this technology:\n\n00:20:43.924 --> 00:20:47.934\nremember, if it doesn't work,\nit's not necessarily you, ok?\n\n00:20:47.958 --> 00:20:50.292\nIt could be the design\nof the thing you're using.\n\n00:20:50.316 --> 00:20:53.104\nBe aware in life\nof good design and bad design.\n\n00:20:53.128 --> 00:20:55.995\nAnd if you're among the people\nwho create this stuff:\n\n00:20:56.019 --> 00:20:57.338\nEasy is hard.\n\n00:20:57.362 --> 00:20:59.696\nPre-sweat the details for your audience.\n\n00:20:59.720 --> 00:21:00.934\nCount the taps.\n\n00:21:00.958 --> 00:21:03.901\nRemember, the hard part\nis not deciding what features to add,\n\n00:21:03.925 --> 00:21:05.694\nit's deciding what to leave out.\n\n00:21:05.718 --> 00:21:08.915\nAnd best of all, your motivation is:\nsimplicity sells.\n\n00:21:09.569 --> 00:21:11.236\nCA: Bravo.

However, when we're not at TED, we are often told that a real sustainability policy agenda is just not feasible, especially in large urban areas like New York City. And that's because most people with decision-making powers, in both the public and the private sector, really don't feel as though they're in danger.The reason why I'm here today, in part, is because of a dog \u2014 an abandoned puppy I found back in the rain, back in 1998. She turned out to be a much bigger dog than I'd anticipated. When she came into my life, we were fighting against a huge waste facility planned for the East River waterfront despite the fact that our small part of New York City already handled more than 40 percent of the entire city's commercial waste: a sewage treatment pelletizing plant, a sewage sludge plant, four power plants, the world's largest food-distribution center, as well as other industries that bring more than 60,000 diesel truck trips to the area each week. The area also has one of the lowest ratios of parks to people in the city.So when I was contacted by the Parks Department about a $10,000 seed-grant initiative to help develop waterfront projects, I thought they were really well-meaning, but a bit naive. I'd lived in this area all my life, and you could not get to the river, because of all the lovely facilities that I mentioned earlier. Then, while jogging with my dog one morning, she pulled me into what I thought was just another illegal dump. There were weeds and piles of garbage and other stuff that I won't mention here, but she kept dragging me, and lo and behold, at the end of that lot was the river. I knew that this forgotten little street-end, abandoned like the dog that brought me there, was worth saving. And I knew it would grow to become the proud beginnings of the community-led revitalization of the new South Bronx.And just like my new dog, it was an idea that got bigger than I'd imagined. We garnered much support along the way, and the Hunts Point Riverside Park became the first waterfront park that the South Bronx had had in more than 60 years. We leveraged that $10,000 seed grant more than 300 times, into a $3 million park.And in the fall, I'm going to exchange marriage vows with my beloved.(Audience whistles)Thank you very much.(Applause)That's him pressing my buttons back there, which he does all the time.(Laughter)(Applause)But those of us living in environmental justice communities are the canary in the coal mine. We feel the problems right now, and have for some time. Environmental justice, for those of you who may not be familiar with the term, goes something like this: no community should be saddled with more environmental burdens and less environmental benefits than any other.Unfortunately, race and class are extremely reliable indicators as to where one might find the good stuff, like parks and trees, and where one might find the bad stuff, like power plants and waste facilities. As a black person in America, I am twice as likely as a white person to live in an area where air pollution poses the greatest risk to my health. I am five times more likely to live within walking distance of a power plant or chemical facility, which I do. These land-use decisions created the hostile conditions that lead to problems like obesity, diabetes and asthma. Why would someone leave their home to go for a brisk walk in a toxic neighborhood? Our 27 percent obesity rate is high even for this country, and diabetes comes with it. One out of four South Bronx children has asthma. Our asthma hospitalization rate is seven times higher than the national average. These impacts are coming everyone's way. And we all pay dearly for solid waste costs, health problems associated with pollution and more odiously, the cost of imprisoning our young black and Latino men, who possess untold amounts of untapped potential. Fifty percent of our residents live at or below the poverty line; 25 percent of us are unemployed. Low-income citizens often use emergency-room visits as primary care. This comes at a high cost to taxpayers and produces no proportional benefits. Poor people are not only still poor, they are still unhealthy.Fortunately, there are many people like me who are striving for solutions that won't compromise the lives of low-income communities of color in the short term, and won't destroy us all in the long term. None of us want that, and we all have that in common. So what else do we have in common?Well, first of all, we're all incredibly good-looking.(Laughter)Graduated high school, college, post-graduate degrees, traveled to interesting places, didn't have kids in your early teens, financially stable, never been imprisoned. OK. Good.(Laughter)But, besides being a black woman, I am different from most of you in some other ways. I watched nearly half of the buildings in my neighborhood burn down. My big brother Lenny fought in Vietnam, only to be gunned down a few blocks from our home. Jesus. I grew up with a crack house across the street. Yeah, I'm a poor black child from the ghetto. These things make me different from you. But the things we have in common set me apart from most of the people in my community, and I am in between these two worlds with enough of my heart to fight for justice in the other.So how did things get so different for us? In the late '40s, my dad \u2014 a Pullman porter, son of a slave \u2014 bought a house in the Hunts Point section of the South Bronx, and a few years later, he married my mom. At the time, the community was a mostly white, working-class neighborhood. My dad was not alone. And as others like him pursued their own version of the American dream, white flight became common in the South Bronx and in many cities around the country. Red-lining was used by banks, wherein certain sections of the city, including ours, were deemed off-limits to any sort of investment. Many landlords believed it was more profitable to torch their buildings and collect insurance money rather than to sell under those conditions \u2014 dead or injured former tenants notwithstanding.Hunts Point was formerly a walk-to-work community, but now residents had neither work nor home to walk to. A national highway construction boom was added to our problems. In New York State, Robert Moses spearheaded an aggressive highway-expansion campaign. One of its primary goals was to make it easier for residents of wealthy communities in Westchester County to go to Manhattan. The South Bronx, which lies in between, did not stand a chance. Residents were often given less than a month's notice before their buildings were razed. 600,000 people were displaced. The common perception was that only pimps and pushers and prostitutes were from the South Bronx. And if you are told from your earliest days that nothing good is going to come from your community, that it's bad and ugly, how could it not reflect on you? So now, my family's property was worthless, save for that it was our home, and all we had. And luckily for me, that home and the love inside of it, along with help from teachers, mentors and friends along the way, was enough.Now, why is this story important? Because from a planning perspective, economic degradation begets environmental degradation, which begets social degradation. The disinvestment that began in the 1960s set the stage for all the environmental injustices that were to come. Antiquated zoning and land-use regulations are still used to this day to continue putting polluting facilities in my neighborhood. Are these factors taken into consideration when land-use policy is decided? What costs are associated with these decisions? And who pays? Who profits? Does anything justify what the local community goes through? This was \"planning\" \u2014 in quotes \u2014 that did not have our best interests in mind.Once we realized that, we decided it was time to do our own planning. That small park I told you about earlier was the first stage of building a Greenway movement in the South Bronx. I wrote a one-and-a-quarter-million dollar federal transportation grant to design the plan for a waterfront esplanade with dedicated on-street bike paths. Physical improvements help inform public policy regarding traffic safety, the placement of the waste and other facilities, which, if done properly, don't compromise a community's quality of life. They provide opportunities to be more physically active, as well as local economic development. Think bike shops, juice stands. We secured 20 million dollars to build first-phase projects. This is Lafayette Avenue \u2014 and that's redesigned by Mathews Nielsen Landscape Architects. And once this path is constructed, it'll connect the South Bronx with more than 400 acres of Randall's Island Park. Right now we're separated by about 25 feet of water, but this link will change that.As we nurture the natural environment, its abundance will give us back even more. We run a project called the Bronx [Environmental] Stewardship Training, which provides job training in the fields of ecological restoration, so that folks from our community have the skills to compete for these well-paying jobs. Little by little, we're seeding the area with green-collar jobs \u2014 and with people that have both a financial and personal stake in their environment. The Sheridan Expressway is an underutilized relic of the Robert Moses era, built with no regard for the neighborhoods that were divided by it. Even during rush hour, it goes virtually unused. The community created an alternative transportation plan that allows for the removal of the highway. We have the opportunity now to bring together all the stakeholders to re-envision how this 28 acres can be better utilized for parkland, affordable housing and local economic development.We also built New York City's first green and cool roof demonstration project on top of our offices. Cool roofs are highly-reflective surfaces that don't absorb solar heat, and pass it on to the building or atmosphere. Green roofs are soil and living plants. Both can be used instead of petroleum-based roofing materials that absorb heat, contribute to urban \"heat island\" effect and degrade under the sun, which we in turn breathe. Green roofs also retain up to 75 percent of rainfall, so they reduce a city's need to fund costly end-of-pipe solutions \u2014 which, incidentally, are often located in environmental justice communities like mine. And they provide habitats for our little friends![Butterfly](Laughter)So cool!Anyway, the demonstration project is a springboard for our own green roof installation business, bringing jobs and sustainable economic activity to the South Bronx.[Green is the new black ...](Laughter) (Applause)I like that, too.Anyway, I know Chris told us not to do pitches up here, but since I have all of your attention: We need investors. End of pitch. It's better to ask for forgiveness than permission. Anyway \u2014(Laughter)(Applause)OK. Katrina.Prior to Katrina, the South Bronx and New Orleans' Ninth Ward had a lot in common. Both were largely populated by poor people of color, both hotbeds of cultural innovation: think hip-hop and jazz. Both are waterfront communities that host both industries and residents in close proximity of one another. In the post-Katrina era, we have still more in common. We're at best ignored, and maligned and abused, at worst, by negligent regulatory agencies, pernicious zoning and lax governmental accountability. Neither the destruction of the Ninth Ward nor the South Bronx was inevitable. But we have emerged with valuable lessons about how to dig ourselves out. We are more than simply national symbols of urban blight or problems to be solved by empty campaign promises of presidents come and gone. Now will we let the Gulf Coast languish for a decade or two, like the South Bronx did? Or will we take proactive steps and learn from the homegrown resource of grassroots activists that have been born of desperation in communities like mine?Now listen, I do not expect individuals, corporations or government to make the world a better place because it is right or moral. This presentation today only represents some of what I've been through. Like a tiny little bit. You've no clue. But I'll tell you later, if you want to know.(Laughter)But \u2014 I know it's the bottom line, or one's perception of it, that motivates people in the end. I'm interested in what I like to call the \"triple bottom line\" that sustainable development can produce. Developments that have the potential to create positive returns for all concerned: the developers, government and the community where these projects go up.At present, that's not happening in New York City. And we are operating with a comprehensive urban-planning deficit. A parade of government subsidies is going to propose big-box and stadium developments in the South Bronx, but there is scant coordination between city agencies on how to deal with the cumulative effects of increased traffic, pollution, solid waste and the impacts on open space. And their approaches to local economic and job development are so lame it's not even funny. Because on top of that, the world's richest sports team is replacing the House That Ruth Built by destroying two well-loved community parks. Now, we'll have even less than that stat I told you about earlier. And although less than 25 percent of South Bronx residents own cars, these projects include thousands of new parking spaces, yet zip in terms of mass public transit. Now, what's missing from the larger debate is a comprehensive cost-benefit analysis between not fixing an unhealthy, environmentally-challenged community, versus incorporating structural, sustainable changes. My agency is working closely with Columbia University and others to shine a light on these issues.Now let's get this straight: I am not anti-development. Ours is a city, not a wilderness preserve. And I've embraced my inner capitalist. And, but I don't have \u2014(Laughter)You probably all have, and if you haven't, you need to.(Laughter)So I don't have a problem with developers making money. There's enough precedent out there to show that a sustainable, community-friendly development can still make a fortune. Fellow TEDsters Bill McDonough and Amory Lovins \u2014 both heroes of mine by the way \u2014 have shown that you can actually do that. I do have a problem with developments that hyper-exploit politically vulnerable communities for profit. That it continues is a shame upon us all, because we are all responsible for the future that we create. But one of the things I do to remind myself of greater possibilities, is to learn from visionaries in other cities. This is my version of globalization.Let's take Bogota. Poor, Latino, surrounded by runaway gun violence and drug trafficking; a reputation not unlike that of the South Bronx. However, this city was blessed in the late 1990s with a highly-influential mayor named Enrique Pe\u00f1alosa. He looked at the demographics. Few Bogotanos own cars, yet a huge portion of the city's resources was dedicated to serving them. If you're a mayor, you can do something about that. His administration narrowed key municipal thoroughfares from five lanes to three, outlawed parking on those streets, expanded pedestrian walkways and bike lanes, created public plazas, created one of the most efficient bus mass-transit systems in the entire world. For his brilliant efforts, he was nearly impeached. But as people began to see that they were being put first on issues reflecting their day-to-day lives, incredible things happened. People stopped littering. Crime rates dropped, because the streets were alive with people. His administration attacked several typical urban problems at one time, and on a third-world budget, at that. We have no excuse in this country, I'm sorry. But the bottom line is: their people-first agenda was not meant to penalize those who could actually afford cars, but rather, to provide opportunities for all Bogotanos to participate in the city's resurgence. That development should not come at the expense of the majority of the population is still considered a radical idea here in the U.S. But Bogota's example has the power to change that.You, however, are blessed with the gift of influence. That's why you're here and why you value the information we exchange. Use your influence in support of comprehensive, sustainable change everywhere. Don't just talk about it at TED. This is a nationwide policy agenda I'm trying to build, and as you all know, politics are personal. Help me make green the new black. Help me make sustainability sexy. Make it a part of your dinner and cocktail conversations. Help me fight for environmental and economic justice. Support investments with a triple-bottom-line return. Help me democratize sustainability by bringing everyone to the table, and insisting that comprehensive planning can be addressed everywhere. Oh good, glad I have a little more time!Listen \u2014 when I spoke to Mr. Gore the other day after breakfast, I asked him how environmental justice activists were going to be included in his new marketing strategy. His response was a grant program. I don't think he understood that I wasn't asking for funding. I was making him an offer.(Applause)What troubled me was that this top-down approach is still around. Now, don't get me wrong, we need money.(Laughter)But grassroots groups are needed at the table during the decision-making process. Of the 90 percent of the energy that Mr. Gore reminded us that we waste every day, don't add wasting our energy, intelligence and hard-earned experience to that count.(Applause)I have come from so far to meet you like this. Please don't waste me. By working together, we can become one of those small, rapidly-growing groups of individuals who actually have the audacity and courage to believe that we actually can change the world. We might have come to this conference from very, very different stations in life, but believe me, we all share one incredibly powerful thing. We have nothing to lose and everything to gain.Ciao, bellos!(Applause)", "id": 53, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:12.958 --> 00:00:14.364\nIf you're

00:01:23.361\nSo when I was contacted\nby the Parks Department\n\n00:01:23.385 --> 00:01:27.543\nabout a $10,000 seed-grant initiative\nto help develop waterfront projects,\n\n00:01:27.567 --> 00:01:30.481\nI thought they were really\nwell-meaning, but a bit naive.\n\n00:01:30.505 --> 00:01:34.172\nI'd lived in this area all my life,\nand you could not get to the river,\n\n00:01:34.196 --> 00:01:37.489\nbecause of all the lovely facilities\nthat I mentioned earlier.\n\n00:01:37.513 --> 00:01:39.773\nThen, while jogging\nwith my dog one morning,\n\n00:01:39.797 --> 00:01:42.908\nshe pulled me into what I thought\nwas just another illegal dump.\n\n00:01:43.564 --> 00:01:47.341\nThere were weeds and piles of garbage\nand other stuff that I won't mention here,\n\n00:01:47.365 -->

than I'd imagined.\n\n00:02:06.283 --> 00:02:08.418\nWe garnered much support along the way,\n\n00:02:08.442 --> 00:02:11.602\nand the Hunts Point Riverside Park\nbecame the first waterfront

00:05:14.796\nBut the things we have in common\n\n00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:17.559\nset me apart from most\nof the people in my community,\n\n00:05:17.583 --> 00:05:19.409\nand I am in between these two

00:05:28.636\nIn the late '40s, my dad --\na Pullman porter, son of a slave --\n\n00:05:28.660 --> 00:05:31.527\nbought a house in the Hunts Point\nsection of the South Bronx,\n\n00:05:31.551 --> 00:05:33.566\nand a few years later, he married my mom.\n\n00:05:33.590 --> 00:05:37.071\nAt the time, the community was a mostly\nwhite, working-class neighborhood.\n\n00:05:37.095 --> 00:05:38.621\nMy dad was not alone.\n\n00:05:38.645 --> 00:05:42.082\nAnd as others like him pursued\ntheir own version of the American dream,\n\n00:05:42.106 --> 00:05:44.635\nwhite flight became common\nin the South Bronx\n\n00:05:44.659 --> 00:05:46.659\nand in many cities around the country.\n\n00:05:46.976 --> 00:05:50.609\nRed-lining was used by banks,\nwherein certain sections of the city,\n\n00:05:50.633 --> 00:05:54.622\nincluding ours, were deemed\noff-limits to any sort of investment.\n\n00:05:54.646 --> 00:05:58.114\nMany landlords believed it was more\nprofitable to torch their buildings\n\n00:05:58.138 --> 00:06:02.309\nand collect insurance money rather\nthan to sell under those conditions --\n\n00:06:02.333 --> 00:06:04.773\ndead or injured former tenants\nnotwithstanding.\n\n00:06:04.797 --> 00:06:07.639\nHunts Point was formerly\na walk-to-work community,\n\n00:06:07.663 --> 00:06:11.589\nbut now residents had neither\nwork nor home to walk to.\n\n00:06:11.613 --> 00:06:14.799\nA national highway construction boom\nwas added to our problems.\n\n00:06:14.823 --> 00:06:15.974\nIn New York State,\n\n00:06:15.998 --> 00:06:19.781\nRobert Moses spearheaded\nan aggressive highway-expansion campaign.\n\n00:06:19.805 --> 00:06:22.001\nOne of its primary goals was\nto make it easier\n\n00:06:22.025 --> 00:06:27.050\nfor residents of wealthy communities\nin Westchester County to go to Manhattan.\n\n00:06:27.074 --> 00:06:30.149\nThe South Bronx, which lies in between,\ndid not stand a chance.\n\n00:06:30.173 --> 00:06:32.723\nResidents were often given\nless than a month's notice\n\n00:06:32.747 --> 00:06:34.377\nbefore their buildings were razed.\n\n00:06:34.401 --> 00:06:36.725\n600,000 people were displaced.\n\n00:06:36.749 --> 00:06:38.059\nThe common perception was\n\n00:06:38.083 --> 00:06:41.934\nthat only pimps and pushers\nand prostitutes were from the South Bronx.\n\n00:06:41.958 --> 00:06:44.888\nAnd if you are told\nfrom your earliest days\n\n00:06:44.912 --> 00:06:47.529\nthat nothing good is going to come\nfrom your community,\n\n00:06:47.553 --> 00:06:48.704\nthat it's bad and ugly,\n\n00:06:48.728 --> 00:06:50.818\nhow could it not reflect on you?\n\n00:06:51.293 --> 00:06:53.811\nSo now, my family's property\nwas worthless,\n\n00:06:53.835 --> 00:06:56.477\nsave for that it was our home,\nand all we had.\n\n00:06:56.501 --> 00:07:00.227\nAnd luckily for me, that home\nand the love inside of it,\n\n00:07:00.251 --> 00:07:05.393\nalong with help from teachers, mentors\nand friends along the way, was enough.\n\n00:07:05.417 --> 00:07:07.106\nNow, why is this story important?\n\n00:07:07.130 --> 00:07:08.940\nBecause from a planning perspective,\n\n00:07:08.964 --> 00:07:12.681\neconomic degradation\nbegets environmental degradation,\n\n00:07:12.705 --> 00:07:15.221\nwhich begets social degradation.\n\n00:07:15.245 --> 00:07:18.308\nThe disinvestment that began\nin the 1960s set the stage\n\n00:07:18.332 --> 00:07:20.934\nfor all the environmental\ninjustices that were to come.\n\n00:07:20.958 --> 00:07:24.934\nAntiquated zoning and land-use\nregulations are still used to this day\n\n00:07:24.958 --> 00:07:28.001\nto continue putting polluting\nfacilities in my neighborhood.\n\n00:07:28.025 --> 00:07:31.803\nAre these factors taken into consideration\nwhen land-use policy is decided?\n\n00:07:31.827 --> 00:07:34.423\nWhat costs are associated\nwith these decisions?\n\n00:07:34.447 --> 00:07:36.683\nAnd who pays? Who profits?\n\n00:07:36.707 --> 00:07:40.326\nDoes anything justify\nwhat the local community goes through?\n\n00:07:40.350 --> 00:07:42.644\nThis was \"planning\" -- in quotes --\n\n00:07:42.668 --> 00:07:44.936\nthat did not have\nour best interests in mind.\n\n00:07:44.960 --> 00:07:48.375\nOnce we realized that, we decided\nit was time to do our own planning.\n\n00:07:48.399 --> 00:07:50.343\nThat small park I told you about earlier\n\n00:07:50.367 --> 00:07:53.645\nwas the first stage of building\na Greenway movement in the South Bronx.\n\n00:07:53.669 --> 00:07:57.021\nI wrote a one-and-a-quarter-million\ndollar federal transportation grant\n\n00:07:57.045 --> 00:07:59.153\nto design the plan\nfor a waterfront esplanade\n\n00:07:59.177 --> 00:08:00.907\nwith dedicated on-street bike paths.\n\n00:08:00.931 --> 00:08:04.389\nPhysical improvements help inform\npublic policy regarding traffic safety,\n\n00:08:04.413 --> 00:08:06.658\nthe placement of the waste\nand other facilities,\n\n00:08:06.682 --> 00:08:10.154\nwhich, if done properly, don't compromise\na community's quality of life.\n\n00:08:10.178 --> 00:08:12.892\nThey provide opportunities\nto be more physically active,\n\n00:08:12.916 --> 00:08:15.349\nas well as local economic development.\n\n00:08:15.373 --> 00:08:16.945\nThink bike shops, juice stands.\n\n00:08:16.969 --> 00:08:19.840\nWe secured 20 million dollars\nto build first-phase projects.\n\n00:08:19.864 --> 00:08:21.738\nThis is Lafayette Avenue --\n\n00:08:21.762 --> 00:08:24.919\nand that's redesigned\nby Mathews Nielsen Landscape Architects.\n\n00:08:24.943 --> 00:08:27.964\nAnd once this path is constructed,\nit'll connect the South Bronx\n\n00:08:27.988 --> 00:08:30.337\nwith more than 400 acres\nof Randall's Island Park.\n\n00:08:30.361 --> 00:08:34.335\nRight now we're separated by about 25 feet\nof water, but this link will change that.\n\n00:08:34.359 --> 00:08:38.623\nAs we nurture the natural environment,\nits abundance will give us back even more.\n\n00:08:38.647 --> 00:08:42.458\nWe run a project called the Bronx\n[Environmental] Stewardship Training,\n\n00:08:42.482 --> 00:08:45.789\nwhich provides job training in the fields\nof ecological restoration,\n\n00:08:45.813 --> 00:08:48.614\nso that folks from our community\nhave the skills to compete\n\n00:08:48.638 --> 00:08:49.977\nfor these well-paying jobs.\n\n00:08:50.001 --> 00:08:53.338\nLittle by little, we're seeding\nthe area with green-collar jobs --\n\n00:08:53.362 --> 00:08:56.221\nand with people that have both\na financial and personal stake\n\n00:08:56.245 --> 00:08:57.402\nin their environment.\n\n00:08:57.426 --> 00:09:00.069\nThe Sheridan Expressway\nis an underutilized relic\n\n00:09:00.093 --> 00:09:01.292\nof the Robert Moses era,\n\n00:09:01.316 --> 00:09:04.692\nbuilt with no regard for the neighborhoods\nthat were divided by it.\n\n00:09:04.716 --> 00:09:07.485\nEven during rush hour,\nit goes virtually unused.\n\n00:09:07.509 --> 00:09:10.181\nThe community created\nan alternative transportation plan\n\n00:09:10.205 --> 00:09:12.831\nthat allows for the removal\nof the highway.\n\n00:09:12.855 --> 00:09:15.978\nWe have the opportunity now to bring\ntogether all the stakeholders\n\n00:09:16.002 --> 00:09:18.590\nto re-envision how this 28 acres\ncan be better utilized\n\n00:09:18.614 --> 00:09:21.656\nfor parkland, affordable housing\nand local economic development.\n\n00:09:21.680 --> 00:09:26.507\nWe also built New York City's first green\nand cool roof demonstration project\n\n00:09:26.531 --> 00:09:27.919\non top of our offices.\n\n00:09:27.943 --> 00:09:31.408\nCool roofs are highly-reflective\nsurfaces that don't absorb solar heat,\n\n00:09:31.432 --> 00:09:33.535\nand pass it on to\nthe building or atmosphere.\n\n00:09:33.559 --> 00:09:35.591\nGreen roofs are soil and living plants.\n\n00:09:35.615 --> 00:09:38.862\nBoth can be used instead\nof petroleum-based roofing materials\n\n00:09:38.886 --> 00:09:41.657\nthat absorb heat, contribute\nto urban \"heat island\" effect\n\n00:09:41.681 --> 00:09:43.006\nand degrade under the sun,\n\n00:09:43.030 --> 00:09:44.252\nwhich we in turn breathe.\n\n00:09:44.276 --> 00:09:46.934\nGreen roofs also retain\nup to 75 percent of rainfall,\n\n00:09:46.958 --> 00:09:50.617\nso they reduce a city's need to fund\ncostly end-of-pipe solutions --\n\n00:09:50.641 --> 00:09:52.461\nwhich, incidentally, are often located\n\n00:09:52.485 --> 00:09:54.706\nin environmental justice\ncommunities like mine.\n\n00:09:54.730 --> 00:09:58.030\nAnd they provide habitats\nfor our little friends!\n\n00:09:58.054 --> 00:09:59.211\n[Butterfly]\n\n00:09:59.235 --> 00:10:00.458\n(Laughter)\n\n00:10:00.482 --> 00:10:01.665\nSo cool!\n\n00:10:01.689 --> 00:10:04.195\nAnyway, the demonstration\nproject is a springboard\n\n00:10:04.219 --> 00:10:06.343\nfor our own green roof\ninstallation business,\n\n00:10:06.367 --> 00:10:09.869\nbringing jobs and sustainable\neconomic activity to the South Bronx.\n\n00:10:09.893 --> 00:10:11.269\n[Green is the new black ...]\n\n00:10:11.293 --> 00:10:15.436\n(Laughter) (Applause)\n\n00:10:15.460 --> 00:10:17.111\nI like that, too.\n\n00:10:17.135 --> 00:10:20.831\nAnyway, I know Chris told us\nnot to do pitches up here,\n\n00:10:20.855 --> 00:10:22.735\nbut since I have all of your attention:\n\n00:10:22.759 --> 00:10:24.346\nWe need investors. End of pitch.\n\n00:10:24.370 --> 00:10:26.758\nIt's better to ask\nfor forgiveness than permission.\n\n00:10:26.782 --> 00:10:27.938\nAnyway --\n\n00:10:27.962 --> 00:10:29.422\n(Laughter)\n\n00:10:29.446 --> 00:10:34.365\n(Applause)\n\n00:10:34.389 --> 00:10:36.652\nOK. Katrina.\n\n00:10:37.842 --> 00:10:40.866\nPrior to Katrina, the South Bronx\nand New Orleans' Ninth Ward\n\n00:10:40.890 --> 00:10:42.079\nhad a lot in common.\n\n00:10:42.103 --> 00:10:44.857\nBoth were largely populated\nby poor people of color,\n\n00:10:44.881 --> 00:10:48.176\nboth hotbeds of cultural innovation:\nthink hip-hop and jazz.\n\n00:10:48.200 --> 00:10:51.534\nBoth are waterfront communities\nthat host both industries and residents\n\n00:10:51.558 --> 00:10:53.444\nin close proximity of one another.\n\n00:10:53.468 --> 00:10:56.516\nIn the post-Katrina era,\nwe have still more in common.\n\n00:10:56.540 --> 00:11:00.018\nWe're at best ignored,\nand maligned and abused, at worst,\n\n00:11:00.042 --> 00:11:03.389\nby negligent regulatory agencies,\npernicious zoning\n\n00:11:03.413 --> 00:11:05.586\nand lax governmental accountability.\n\n00:11:05.610 --> 00:11:10.038\nNeither the destruction of the Ninth Ward\nnor the South Bronx was inevitable.\n\n00:11:10.062 --> 00:11:12.198\nBut we have emerged with valuable lessons\n\n00:11:12.222 --> 00:11:14.495\nabout how to dig ourselves out.\n\n00:11:14.519 --> 00:11:18.321\nWe are more than simply\nnational symbols of urban blight\n\n00:11:18.345 --> 00:11:21.651\nor problems to be solved\nby empty campaign promises\n\n00:11:21.675 --> 00:11:23.285\nof presidents come and gone.\n\n00:11:23.309 --> 00:11:26.128\nNow will we let the Gulf Coast\nlanguish for a decade or two,\n\n00:11:26.152 --> 00:11:27.414\nlike the South Bronx did?\n\n00:11:27.438 --> 00:11:28.922\nOr will we take proactive steps\n\n00:11:28.946 --> 00:11:31.883\nand learn from the homegrown resource\nof grassroots activists\n\n00:11:31.907 --> 00:11:34.753\nthat have been born of desperation\nin communities like mine?\n\n00:11:34.777 --> 00:11:37.420\nNow listen, I do not expect individuals,\n\n00:11:37.444 --> 00:11:40.229\ncorporations or government\nto make the world a better place\n\n00:11:40.253 --> 00:11:42.077\nbecause it is right or moral.\n\n00:11:42.554 --> 00:11:46.834\nThis presentation today only represents\nsome of what I've been through.\n\n00:11:46.858 --> 00:11:48.934\nLike a tiny little bit. You've no clue.\n\n00:11:48.958 --> 00:11:51.054\nBut I'll tell you later,\nif you want to know.\n\n00:11:51.078 --> 00:11:52.143\n(Laughter)\n\n00:11:52.167 --> 00:11:56.457\nBut -- I know it's the bottom line,\nor one's perception of it,\n\n00:11:56.481 --> 00:11:58.217\nthat motivates people in the end.\n\n00:11:58.241 --> 00:12:01.163\nI'm interested in what I like to call\nthe \"triple bottom line\"\n\n00:12:01.187 --> 00:12:03.411\nthat sustainable development can produce.\n\n00:12:03.435 --> 00:12:07.357\nDevelopments that have the potential\nto create positive returns\n\n00:12:07.381 --> 00:12:10.483\nfor all concerned:\nthe developers, government\n\n00:12:10.507 --> 00:12:12.943\nand the community\nwhere these projects go up.\n\n00:12:12.967 --> 00:12:15.507\nAt present, that's not happening\nin New York City.\n\n00:12:16.269 --> 00:12:19.934\nAnd we are operating with a comprehensive\nurban-planning deficit.\n\n00:12:20.316 --> 00:12:22.411\nA parade of government subsidies\n\n00:12:22.435 --> 00:12:25.987\nis going to propose big-box and stadium\ndevelopments in the South Bronx,\n\n00:12:26.011 --> 00:12:29.094\nbut there is scant coordination\nbetween city agencies\n\n00:12:29.118 --> 00:12:32.868\non how to deal with the cumulative effects\nof increased traffic, pollution,\n\n00:12:32.892 --> 00:12:35.417\nsolid waste and the impacts on open space.\n\n00:12:35.441 --> 00:12:39.821\nAnd their approaches to local economic\nand job development are so lame\n\n00:12:39.845 --> 00:12:41.016\nit's not even funny.\n\n00:12:41.040 --> 00:12:43.239\nBecause on top of that,\n\n00:12:43.263 --> 00:12:47.686\nthe world's richest sports team\nis replacing the House That Ruth Built\n\n00:12:47.710 --> 00:12:50.527\nby destroying two\nwell-loved community parks.\n\n00:12:50.551 --> 00:12:53.662\nNow, we'll have even less\nthan that stat I told you about earlier.\n\n00:12:53.686 --> 00:12:57.004\nAnd although less than 25 percent\nof South Bronx residents own cars,\n\n00:12:57.028 --> 00:13:00.702\nthese projects include\nthousands of new parking spaces,\n\n00:13:00.726 --> 00:13:03.980\nyet zip in terms of mass public transit.\n\n00:13:04.004 --> 00:13:06.036\nNow, what's missing from the larger debate\n\n00:13:06.060 --> 00:13:07.989\nis a comprehensive cost-benefit analysis\n\n00:13:08.013 --> 00:13:11.412\nbetween not fixing an unhealthy,\nenvironmentally-challenged community,\n\n00:13:11.436 --> 00:13:15.043\nversus incorporating structural,\nsustainable changes.\n\n00:13:15.067 --> 00:13:18.298\nMy agency is working closely\nwith Columbia University and others\n\n00:13:18.322 --> 00:13:19.908\nto shine a light on these issues.\n\n00:13:19.932 --> 00:13:23.131\nNow let's get this straight:\nI am not anti-development.\n\n00:13:23.155 --> 00:13:25.563\nOurs is a city, not a wilderness preserve.\n\n00:13:25.587 --> 00:13:28.626\nAnd I've embraced my inner capitalist.\n\n00:13:28.650 --> 00:13:30.127\nAnd, but I don't have --\n\n00:13:30.151 --> 00:13:31.776\n(Laughter)\n\n00:13:31.800 --> 00:13:34.396\nYou probably all have,\nand if you haven't, you need to.\n\n00:13:34.420 --> 00:13:38.190\n(Laughter)\n\n00:13:38.214 --> 00:13:41.630\nSo I don't have a problem\nwith developers making money.\n\n00:13:41.654 --> 00:13:44.604\nThere's enough precedent out there\nto show that a sustainable,\n\n00:13:44.628 --> 00:13:49.019\ncommunity-friendly development\ncan still make a fortune.\n\n00:13:49.043 --> 00:13:52.115\nFellow TEDsters Bill McDonough\nand Amory Lovins --\n\n00:13:52.139 --> 00:13:56.108\nboth heroes of mine by the way --\nhave shown that you can actually do that.\n\n00:13:56.132 --> 00:13:58.934\nI do have a problem\nwith developments that hyper-exploit\n\n00:13:58.958 --> 00:14:01.125\npolitically vulnerable\ncommunities for profit.\n\n00:14:01.149 --> 00:14:03.997\nThat it continues is a shame upon us all,\n\n00:14:04.021 --> 00:14:06.962\nbecause we are all responsible\nfor the future that we create.\n\n00:14:06.986 --> 00:14:10.233\nBut one of the things I do\nto remind myself of greater possibilities,\n\n00:14:10.257 --> 00:14:12.391\nis to learn from visionaries\nin other cities.\n\n00:14:12.415 --> 00:14:14.447\nThis is my version of globalization.\n\n00:14:14.471 --> 00:14:16.004\nLet's take Bogota.\n\n00:14:16.028 --> 00:14:19.821\nPoor, Latino, surrounded by\nrunaway gun violence and drug trafficking;\n\n00:14:19.845 --> 00:14:22.683\na reputation not unlike\nthat of the South Bronx.\n\n00:14:22.707 --> 00:14:25.934\nHowever, this city was blessed\nin the late 1990s\n\n00:14:25.958 --> 00:14:29.982\nwith a highly-influential\nmayor named Enrique Pe\u00f1alosa.\n\n00:14:30.006 --> 00:14:31.787\nHe looked at the demographics.\n\n00:14:31.811 --> 00:14:33.542\nFew Bogotanos own cars,\n\n00:14:33.566 --> 00:14:37.604\nyet a huge portion of the

00:15:24.390\nBut the bottom line is:\ntheir people-first agenda\n\n00:15:24.414 --> 00:15:28.328\nwas not meant to penalize\nthose who could actually afford cars,\n\n00:15:28.352 --> 00:15:32.217\nbut rather, to provide opportunities\nfor all Bogotanos to participate\n\n00:15:32.241 --> 00:15:33.863\nin the city's resurgence.\n\n00:15:33.887 --> 00:15:36.047\nThat development

table,\n\n00:16:24.522 --> 00:16:27.871\nand insisting that comprehensive\nplanning can be addressed everywhere.\n\n00:16:27.895 --> 00:16:29.803\nOh good, glad I have a little more

understood\nthat I wasn't asking for funding.\n\n00:16:50.694 --> 00:16:52.466\nI was making him an offer.\n\n00:16:54.191 --> 00:17:00.703\n(Applause)\n\n00:17:01.941 --> 00:17:06.305\nWhat troubled me was that this\ntop-down approach is still around.\n\n00:17:07.218 --> 00:17:09.108\nNow, don't get me wrong, we need money.\n\n00:17:09.132 --> 00:17:10.544\n(Laughter)\n\n00:17:10.568 -->

10 years ago, I took on the task to teach global development to Swedish undergraduate students. That was after having spent about 20 years together with African institutions studying hunger in Africa, so I was sort of expected to know a little about the world. And I started in our medical university, Karolinska Institute, an undergraduate course called Global Health. But when you get that opportunity, you get a little nervous. I thought, these students coming to us actually have the highest grade you can get in Swedish college systems \u2014 so I thought, maybe they know everything I'm going to teach them about. So I did a pre-test when they came. And one of the questions from which I learned a lot was this one: \"Which country has the highest child mortality of these five pairs?\"I put them together, so that in each pair of country, one has twice the child mortality of the other. And this means that it's much bigger a difference than the uncertainty of the data. I won't put you at a test here, but it's Turkey, which is highest there, Poland, Russia, Pakistan and South Africa. And these were the results of the Swedish students. I did it so I got the confidence interval, which is pretty narrow, and I got happy, of course: a 1.8 right answer out of five possible. That means that there was a place for a professor of international health and for my course.(Laughter)But one late night, when I was compiling the report, I really realized my discovery. I have shown that Swedish top students know statistically significantly less about the world than the chimpanzees.(Laughter)Because the chimpanzee would score half right if I gave them two bananas with Sri Lanka and Turkey. They would be right half of the cases. But the students are not there. The problem for me was not ignorance; it was preconceived ideas.I did also an unethical study of the professors of the Karolinska Institute, that hands out the Nobel Prize in Medicine, and they are on par with the chimpanzee there.(Laughter)This is where I realized that there was really a need to communicate, because the data of what's happening in the world and the child health of every country is very well aware.We did this software which displays it like this: every bubble here is a country. This country over here is China. This is India. The size of the bubble is the population, and on this axis here, I put fertility rate. Because my students, what they said when they looked upon the world, and I asked them, \"What do you really think about the world?\" Well, I first discovered that the textbook was Tintin, mainly.(Laughter)And they said, \"The world is still 'we' and 'them.' And 'we' is Western world and 'them' is Third World.\" \"And what do you mean with Western world?\" I said. \"Well, that's long life and small family, and Third World is short life and large family.\"So this is what I could display here. I put fertility rate here: number of children per woman: one, two, three, four, up to about eight children per woman. We have very good data since 1962 \u2014 1960 about \u2014 on the size of families in all countries. The error margin is narrow. Here, I put life expectancy at birth, from 30 years in some countries up to about 70 years. And 1962, there was really a group of countries here that was industrialized countries, and they had small families and long lives. And these were the developing countries: they had large families and they had relatively short lives. Now, what has happened since 1962? We want to see the change. Are the students right? Is it still two types of countries? Or have these developing countries got smaller families and they live here? Or have they got longer lives and live up there?Let's see. We stopped the world then. This is all U.N. statistics that have been available. Here we go. Can you see there? It's China there, moving against better health there, improving there. All the green Latin American countries are moving towards smaller families. Your yellow ones here are the Arabic countries, and they get longer life, but not larger families. The Africans are the green here. They still remain here. This is India; Indonesia is moving on pretty fast.(Laughter)In the '80s here, you have Bangladesh still among the African countries. But now, Bangladesh \u2014 it's a miracle that happens in the '80s: the imams start to promote family planning. They move up into that corner. And in the '90s, we have the terrible HIV epidemic that takes down the life expectancy of the African countries and all the rest of them move up into the corner, where we have long lives and small family, and we have a completely new world.(Applause)(Applause ends)Let me make a comparison directly between the United States of America and Vietnam. 1964. America had small families and long life; Vietnam had large families and short lives. And this is what happens: the data during the war indicate that even with all the death, there was an improvement of life expectancy. By the end of the year, the family planning started in Vietnam; they went for smaller families. And the United States up there is getting for longer life, keeping family size. And in the '80s now, they give up Communist planning and they go for market economy, and it moves faster even than social life. And today, we have in Vietnam the same life expectancy and the same family size here in Vietnam, 2003, as in United States, 1974, by the end of the war. If we don't look in the data, I think we all underestimate the tremendous change in Asia, which was in social change before we saw the economical change.Let's move over to another way here in which we could display the distribution in the world of the income. This is the world distribution of income of people. One dollar, 10 dollars or 100 dollars per day. There's no gap between rich and poor any longer. This is a myth. There's a little hump here. But there are people all the way. And if we look where the income ends up, this is 100 percent the world's annual income. And the richest 20 percent, they take out of that about 74 percent. And the poorest 20 percent, they take about two percent. And this shows that the concept of developing countries is extremely doubtful. We think about aid, like these people here giving aid to these people here. But in the middle, we have most of the world population, and they have now 24 percent of the income.We heard it in other forms. And who are these? Where are the different countries? I can show you Africa. This is Africa. 10% the world population, most in poverty. This is OECD. The rich country. The country club of the U.N. And they are over here on this side. Quite an overlap between Africa and OECD. And this is Latin America. It has everything on this Earth, from the poorest to the richest in Latin America. And on top of that, we can put East Europe, we can put East Asia, and we put South Asia.And how did it look like if we go back in time, to about 1970? Then there was more of a hump. And we have most who lived in absolute poverty were Asians. The problem in the world was the poverty in Asia. And if I now let the world move forward, you will see that while population increases, there are hundreds of millions in Asia getting out of poverty and some others getting into poverty, and this is the pattern we have today. And the best projection from the World Bank is that this will happen, and we will not have a divided world. We'll have most people in the middle.Of course it's a logarithmic scale here, but our concept of economy is growth with percent. We look upon it as a possibility of percentile increase. If I change this, and take GDP per capita instead of family income, and I turn these individual data into regional data of gross domestic product, and I take the regions down here, the size of the bubble is still the population. And you have the OECD there, and you have sub-Saharan Africa there, and we take off the Arab states there, coming both from Africa and from Asia, and we put them separately, and we can expand this axis, and I can give it a new dimension here, by adding the social values there, child survival. Now I have money on that axis, and I have the possibility of children to survive there. In some countries, 99.7% of children survive to five years of age; others, only 70. And here, it seems, there is a gap between OECD, Latin America, East Europe, East Asia, Arab states, South Asia and sub-Saharan Africa. The linearity is very strong between child survival and money.But let me split sub-Saharan Africa. Health is there and better health is up there. I can go here and I can split sub-Saharan Africa into its countries. And when it burst, the size of its country bubble is the size of the population. Sierra Leone down there. Mauritius is up there. Mauritius was the first country to get away with trade barriers, and they could sell their sugar \u2014 they could sell their textiles \u2014 on equal terms as the people in Europe and North America.There's a huge difference between Africa. And Ghana is here in the middle. In Sierra Leone, humanitarian aid. Here in Uganda, development aid. Here, time to invest; there, you can go for a holiday. It's a tremendous variation within Africa which we rarely often make \u2014 that it's equal everything. I can split South Asia here. India's the big bubble in the middle. But a huge difference between Afghanistan and Sri Lanka. I can split Arab states. How are they? Same climate, same culture, same religion \u2014 huge difference. Even between neighbors. Yemen, civil war. United Arab Emirates, money, which was quite equally and well used. Not as the myth is. And that includes all the children of the foreign workers who are in the country.Data is often better than you think. Many people say data is bad. There is an uncertainty margin, but we can see the difference here: Cambodia, Singapore. The differences are much bigger than the weakness of the data. East Europe: Soviet economy for a long time, but they come out after 10 years very, very differently. And there is Latin America. Today, we don't have to go to Cuba to find a healthy country in Latin America. Chile will have a lower child mortality than Cuba within some few years from now. Here, we have high-income countries in the OECD.And we get the whole pattern here of the world, which is more or less like this. And if we look at it, how the world looks, in 1960, it starts to move. This is Mao Tse-tung. He brought health to China. And then he died. And then Deng Xiaoping came and brought money to China, and brought them into the mainstream again. And we have seen how countries move in different directions like this, so it's sort of difficult to get an example country which shows the pattern of the world.But I would like to bring you back to about here, at 1960. I would like to compare South Korea, which is this one, with Brazil, which is this one. The label went away for me here. And I would like to compare Uganda, which is there. And I can run it forward, like this. And you can see how South Korea is making a very, very fast advancement, whereas Brazil is much slower.And if we move back again, here, and we put on trails on them, like this, you can see again that the speed of development is very, very different, and the countries are moving more or less in the same rate as money and health, but it seems you can move much faster if you are healthy first than if you are wealthy first. And to show that, you can put on the way of United Arab Emirates. They came from here, a mineral country. They cached all the oil; they got all the money; but health cannot be bought at the supermarket. You have to invest in health. You have to get kids into schooling. You have to train health staff. You have to educate the population. And Sheikh Zayed did that in a fairly good way. In spite of falling oil prices, he brought this country up here. So we've got a much more mainstream appearance of the world, where all countries tend to use their money better than they used in the past.Now, this is, more or less, if you look at the average data of the countries \u2014 they are like this. Now that's dangerous, to use average data, because there is such a lot of difference within countries. So if I go and look here, we can see that Uganda today is where South Korea was in 1960. If I split Uganda, there's quite a difference within Uganda. These are the quintiles of Uganda. The richest 20 percent of Ugandans are there. The poorest are down there. If I split South Africa, it's like this. And if I go down and look at Niger, where there was such a terrible famine, lastly, it's like this. The 20 percent poorest of Niger is out here, and the 20 percent richest of South Africa is there, and yet we tend to discuss on what solutions there should be in Africa. Everything in this world exists in Africa. And you can't discuss universal access to HIV [medicine] for that quintile up here with the same strategy as down here. The improvement of the world must be highly contextualized, and it's not relevant to have it on regional level. We must be much more detailed. We find that students get very excited when they can use this.And even more, policy makers and the corporate sectors would like to see how the world is changing. Now, why doesn't this take place? Why are we not using the data we have? We have data in the United Nations, in the national statistical agencies and in universities and other non-governmental organizations. Because the data is hidden down in the databases. And the public is there, and the Internet is there, but we have still not used it effectively.All that information we saw changing in the world does not include publicly-funded statistics. There are some web pages like this, you know, but they take some nourishment down from the databases, but people put prices on them, stupid passwords and boring statistics.(Laughter)And this won't work.(Applause)So what is needed? We have the databases. It's not the new database you need. We have wonderful design tools, and more and more are added up here. So we started a nonprofit venture which, linking data to design, we called Gapminder, from the London Underground, where they warn you, \"mind the gap.\" So we thought Gapminder was appropriate. And we started to write software which could link the data like this. And it wasn't that difficult. It took some person years, and we have produced animations. You can take a data set and put it there. We are liberating U.N. data, some few U.N. organization.Some countries accept that their databases can go out on the world, but what we really need is, of course, a search function. A search function where we can copy the data up to a searchable format and get it out in the world. And what do we hear when we go around? I've done anthropology on the main statistical units. Everyone says, \"It's impossible. This can't be done. Our information is so peculiar in detail, so that cannot be searched as others can be searched. We cannot give the data free to the students, free to the entrepreneurs of the world.\"But this is what we would like to see, isn't it? The publicly-funded data is down here. And we would like flowers to grow out on the Net. And one of the crucial points is to make them searchable, and then people can use the different design tool to animate it there. And I have pretty good news for you. I have good news that the present, new Head of U.N. Statistics, he doesn't say it's impossible. He only says, \"We can't do it.\"(Laughter)And that's a quite clever guy, huh?(Laughter)So we can see a lot happening in data in the coming years. We will be able to look at income distributions in completely new ways. This is the income distribution of China, 1970. This is the income distribution of the United States, 1970. Almost no overlap. And what has happened? What has happened is this: that China is growing, it's not so equal any longer, and it's appearing here, overlooking the United States. Almost like a ghost, isn't it?(Laughter)It's pretty scary.(Laughter)But I think it's very important to have all this information. We need really to see it. And instead of looking at this, I would like to end up by showing the Internet users per 1,000. In this software, we access about 500 variables from all the countries quite easily. It takes some time to change for this, but on the axises, you can quite easily get any variable you would like to have. And the thing would be to get up the databases free, to get them searchable, and with a second click, to get them into the graphic formats, where you can instantly understand them. Now, statisticians don't like it, because they say that this will not show the reality; we have to have statistical, analytical methods. But this is hypothesis-generating.I end now with the world. There, the Internet is coming. The number of Internet users are going up like this. This is the GDP per capita. And it's a new technology coming in, but then amazingly, how well it fits to the economy of the countries. That's why the $100 computer will be so important. But it's a nice tendency. It's as if the world is flattening off, isn't it? These countries are lifting more than the economy and will be very interesting to follow this over the year, as I would like you to be able to do with all the publicly funded data.Thank you very much.(Applause)", "id": 92, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:12.584 --> 00:00:16.939\nAbout 10 years ago, I took on the task\nto teach global

won't put you at a test here,\nbut it's Turkey,\n\n00:01:13.714 --> 00:01:17.934\nwhich is highest there, Poland,\nRussia, Pakistan and South Africa.\n\n00:01:17.958 --> 00:01:20.614\nAnd these were the results\nof the Swedish students.\n\n00:01:20.638 --> 00:01:24.543\nI did it so I got the confidence interval,\nwhich is pretty narrow, and I got happy,\n\n00:01:24.567 --> 00:01:27.358\nof course: a 1.8 right answer\nout of five possible.\n\n00:01:27.382 --> 00:01:30.934\nThat means that there was a place\nfor a professor of international health\n\n00:01:30.958 --> 00:01:32.065\nand for my course.\n\n00:01:32.089 --> 00:01:33.207\n(Laughter)\n\n00:01:33.231 --> 00:01:36.934\nBut one late night,\nwhen I was compiling the report,\n\n00:01:36.958 --> 00:01:39.790\nI really realized my discovery.\n\n00:01:39.814 --> 00:01:42.921\nI have shown that Swedish top students\n\n00:01:42.945 --> 00:01:47.934\nknow statistically significantly less\nabout the world than the chimpanzees.\n\n00:01:47.958 --> 00:01:49.934\n(Laughter)\n\n00:01:49.958 --> 00:01:53.188\nBecause the chimpanzee\nwould score half right\n\n00:01:53.212 --> 00:01:56.071\nif I gave them two bananas\nwith Sri Lanka and Turkey.\n\n00:01:56.095 --> 00:01:59.517\nThey would be right half of the cases.\nBut the students are not there.\n\n00:01:59.541 --> 00:02:03.756\nThe problem for me was not ignorance;\nit was preconceived ideas.\n\n00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:06.517\nI did also an unethical study\n\n00:02:06.541 --> 00:02:08.764\nof the professors\nof the Karolinska Institute,\n\n00:02:08.788 --> 00:02:11.149\nthat hands out\nthe Nobel Prize in Medicine,\n\n00:02:11.173 --> 00:02:13.364\nand they are on par\nwith the chimpanzee there.\n\n00:02:13.388 --> 00:02:16.412\n(Laughter)\n\n00:02:16.436 --> 00:02:20.619\nThis is where I realized that\nthere was really a need to communicate,\n\n00:02:20.643 --> 00:02:23.545\nbecause the data\nof what's happening in the world\n\n00:02:23.569 --> 00:02:26.740\nand the child health\nof every country is very well aware.\n\n00:02:26.764 --> 00:02:29.684\nWe did this software\nwhich displays it like this:\n\n00:02:29.708 --> 00:02:31.489\nevery bubble here is a country.\n\n00:02:31.513 --> 00:02:36.530\nThis country over here is China.\n\n00:02:36.554 --> 00:02:37.555\nThis is India.\n\n00:02:37.579 --> 00:02:39.843\nThe size of the bubble is the population,\n\n00:02:39.867 --> 00:02:43.648\nand on this axis here,\nI put fertility rate.\n\n00:02:43.672 --> 00:02:45.934\nBecause my students, what they said\n\n00:02:45.958 --> 00:02:48.767\nwhen they looked upon the world,\nand I asked them,\n\n00:02:48.791 --> 00:02:51.137\n\"What do you really\nthink about the world?\"\n\n00:02:51.161 --> 00:02:54.703\nWell, I first discovered\nthat the textbook was Tintin, mainly.\n\n00:02:54.727 --> 00:02:55.876\n(Laughter)\n\n00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:58.415\nAnd they said, \"The world\nis still 'we' and 'them.'\n\n00:02:58.439 --> 00:03:01.407\nAnd 'we' is Western world\nand 'them' is Third World.\"\n\n00:03:02.286 --> 00:03:04.849\n\"And what do you mean\nwith Western world?\" I said.\n\n00:03:04.873 --> 00:03:06.850\n\"Well, that's long life and small family,\n\n00:03:06.874 --> 00:03:09.206\nand Third World is short life\nand large family.\"\n\n00:03:10.016 --> 00:03:12.394\nSo this is what I could display here.\n\n00:03:12.418 --> 00:03:15.794\nI put fertility rate here:\nnumber of children per woman:\n\n00:03:15.818 --> 00:03:18.934\none, two, three, four,\nup to about eight children per woman.\n\n00:03:18.958 --> 00:03:23.303\nWe have very good data\nsince 1962 -- 1960 about --\n\n00:03:23.327 --> 00:03:25.360\non the size of families in all countries.\n\n00:03:25.384 --> 00:03:26.759\nThe error margin is narrow.\n\n00:03:26.783 --> 00:03:28.630\nHere, I put life expectancy at birth,\n\n00:03:28.654 --> 00:03:31.934\nfrom 30 years in some countries\nup to about 70 years.\n\n00:03:31.958 --> 00:03:34.934\nAnd 1962, there was really\na group of countries here\n\n00:03:34.958 --> 00:03:38.211\nthat was industrialized countries,\n\n00:03:38.235 --> 00:03:40.559\nand they had small families\nand long lives.\n\n00:03:40.583 --> 00:03:42.597\nAnd these were the developing countries:\n\n00:03:42.621 --> 00:03:45.699\nthey had large families\nand they had relatively short lives.\n\n00:03:45.723 --> 00:03:49.602\nNow, what has happened since 1962?\nWe want to see the change.\n\n00:03:49.626 --> 00:03:52.563\nAre the students right?\nIs it still two types of countries?\n\n00:03:52.587 --> 00:03:56.146\nOr have these developing countries\ngot smaller families and they live here?\n\n00:03:56.170 --> 00:03:58.645\nOr have they got longer lives\nand live up there?\n\n00:03:58.669 --> 00:04:00.510\nLet's see. We stopped the world then.\n\n00:04:00.534 --> 00:04:03.020\nThis is all U.N. statistics\nthat have been available.\n\n00:04:03.044 --> 00:04:04.545\nHere we go. Can you see there?\n\n00:04:04.569 --> 00:04:07.856\nIt's China there, moving against\nbetter health there, improving there.\n\n00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:11.525\nAll the green Latin American countries\nare moving towards smaller families.\n\n00:04:11.549 --> 00:04:13.971\nYour yellow ones here\nare the Arabic countries,\n\n00:04:13.995 --> 00:04:17.896\nand they get longer life,\nbut not larger families.\n\n00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:20.542\nThe Africans are the green here.\nThey still remain here.\n\n00:04:20.566 --> 00:04:22.944\nThis is India; Indonesia\nis moving on pretty fast.\n\n00:04:22.968 --> 00:04:23.997\n(Laughter)\n\n00:04:24.021 --> 00:04:27.456\nIn the '80s here, you have Bangladesh\nstill among the African countries.\n\n00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:30.433\nBut now, Bangladesh --\nit's a miracle that happens in the '80s:\n\n00:04:30.457 --> 00:04:32.934\nthe imams start to promote\nfamily planning.\n\n00:04:32.958 --> 00:04:34.797\nThey move up into that corner.\n\n00:04:34.821 --> 00:04:38.022\nAnd in the '90s, we have\nthe terrible HIV epidemic\n\n00:04:38.046 --> 00:04:41.652\nthat takes down the life expectancy\nof the African countries\n\n00:04:41.676 --> 00:04:44.934\nand all the rest of them\nmove up into the corner,\n\n00:04:44.958 --> 00:04:49.872\nwhere we have long lives and small family,\nand we have a completely new world.\n\n00:04:49.896 --> 00:04:53.110\n(Applause)\n\n00:05:00.837 --> 00:05:01.934\n(Applause ends)\n\n00:05:01.958 --> 00:05:04.338\nLet me make a comparison directly\n\n00:05:04.362 --> 00:05:07.289\nbetween the United States\nof America and Vietnam.\n\n00:05:07.313 --> 00:05:08.512\n1964.\n\n00:05:09.496 --> 00:05:12.107\nAmerica had small families and long life;\n\n00:05:12.131 --> 00:05:15.257\nVietnam had large families\nand short lives.\n\n00:05:15.281 --> 00:05:16.949\nAnd this is what happens:\n\n00:05:16.973 --> 00:05:21.934\nthe data during the war indicate\nthat even with all the death,\n\n00:05:21.958 --> 00:05:24.111\nthere was an improvement\nof life expectancy.\n\n00:05:24.135 --> 00:05:27.099\nBy the end of the year,\nthe family planning started in Vietnam;\n\n00:05:27.123 --> 00:05:28.690\nthey went for smaller families.\n\n00:05:28.714 --> 00:05:31.605\nAnd the United States up there\nis getting for longer life,\n\n00:05:31.629 --> 00:05:32.736\nkeeping family size.\n\n00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:35.796\nAnd in the '80s now,\nthey give up Communist planning\n\n00:05:35.820 --> 00:05:37.779\nand they go for market economy,\n\n00:05:37.803 --> 00:05:39.804\nand it moves faster even than social life.\n\n00:05:39.828 --> 00:05:42.109\nAnd today, we have in Vietnam\n\n00:05:42.133 --> 00:05:46.804\nthe same life expectancy\nand the same family size\n\n00:05:46.828 --> 00:05:49.903\nhere in Vietnam, 2003,\n\n00:05:49.927 --> 00:05:53.663\nas in United States, 1974,\nby the end of the war.\n\n00:05:54.520 --> 00:05:57.767\nIf we don't look in the data,\n\n00:05:57.791 --> 00:06:00.934\nI think we all underestimate\nthe tremendous change in Asia,\n\n00:06:00.958 --> 00:06:05.727\nwhich was in social change\nbefore we saw the economical change.\n\n00:06:05.751 --> 00:06:09.934\nLet's move over to another way here\nin which we could display\n\n00:06:09.958 --> 00:06:13.835\nthe distribution\nin the world of the income.\n\n00:06:13.859 --> 00:06:17.326\nThis is the world distribution\nof income of people.\n\n00:06:18.457 --> 00:06:21.934\nOne dollar, 10 dollars\nor 100 dollars per day.\n\n00:06:23.029 --> 00:06:26.370\nThere's no gap between rich\nand poor any longer. This is a myth.\n\n00:06:26.394 --> 00:06:28.409\nThere's a little hump here.\n\n00:06:29.077 --> 00:06:30.934\nBut there are people all the way.\n\n00:06:30.958 --> 00:06:34.934\nAnd if we look where the income ends up,\n\n00:06:34.958 --> 00:06:39.280\nthis is 100 percent\nthe world's annual income.\n\n00:06:39.304 --> 00:06:41.767\nAnd the richest 20 percent,\n\n00:06:41.791 --> 00:06:45.665\nthey take out of that about 74 percent.\n\n00:06:45.689 --> 00:06:50.840\nAnd the poorest 20 percent,\nthey take about two percent.\n\n00:06:50.864 --> 00:06:53.773\nAnd this shows that the concept\nof developing countries\n\n00:06:53.797 --> 00:06:55.152\nis extremely doubtful.\n\n00:06:55.176 --> 00:06:56.934\nWe think about aid,\n\n00:06:56.958 --> 00:07:00.906\nlike these people here giving aid\nto these people here.\n\n00:07:00.930 --> 00:07:03.568\nBut in the middle, we have\nmost of the world population,\n\n00:07:03.592 --> 00:07:06.683\nand they have now\n24 percent of the income.\n\n00:07:06.707 --> 00:07:10.477\nWe heard it in other forms.\nAnd who are these?\n\n00:07:10.501 --> 00:07:14.902\nWhere are the different countries?\nI can show you Africa.\n\n00:07:14.926 --> 00:07:16.350\nThis is Africa.\n\n00:07:17.080 --> 00:07:19.744\n10% the world population, most in poverty.\n\n00:07:19.768 --> 00:07:21.781\nThis is OECD.\n\n00:07:21.805 --> 00:07:24.388\nThe rich country.\nThe country club of the U.N.\n\n00:07:24.412 --> 00:07:29.828\nAnd they are over here on this side.\nQuite an overlap between Africa and OECD.\n\n00:07:29.852 --> 00:07:31.200\nAnd this is Latin America.\n\n00:07:31.224 --> 00:07:34.579\nIt has everything on this Earth,\nfrom the poorest to the richest\n\n00:07:34.603 --> 00:07:35.851\nin Latin America.\n\n00:07:35.875 --> 00:07:38.893\nAnd on top of that,\nwe can put East Europe,\n\n00:07:38.917 --> 00:07:42.306\nwe can put East Asia,\nand we put South Asia.\n\n00:07:42.330 --> 00:07:45.460\nAnd how did it look like\nif we go back in time,\n\n00:07:45.484 --> 00:07:47.387\nto about 1970?\n\n00:07:47.411 --> 00:07:49.933\nThen there was more of a hump.\n\n00:07:51.112 --> 00:07:54.520\nAnd we have most who lived\nin absolute poverty were Asians.\n\n00:07:54.544 --> 00:07:57.736\nThe problem in the world\nwas the poverty in Asia.\n\n00:07:57.760 --> 00:08:00.934\nAnd if I now let the world move forward,\n\n00:08:00.958 --> 00:08:03.708\nyou will see that\nwhile population increases,\n\n00:08:03.732 --> 00:08:06.801\nthere are hundreds of millions\nin Asia getting out of poverty\n\n00:08:06.825 --> 00:08:09.034\nand some others getting into poverty,\n\n00:08:09.058 --> 00:08:10.959\nand this is the pattern we have today.\n\n00:08:10.983 --> 00:08:13.054\nAnd the best projection\nfrom the World Bank\n\n00:08:13.078 --> 00:08:14.812\nis that this will happen,\n\n00:08:14.836 --> 00:08:16.864\nand we will not have a divided world.\n\n00:08:16.888 --> 00:08:18.783\nWe'll have most people in the middle.\n\n00:08:18.807 --> 00:08:20.712\nOf course it's a logarithmic scale here,\n\n00:08:20.736 --> 00:08:24.255\nbut our concept of economy\nis growth with percent.\n\n00:08:24.279 --> 00:08:29.327\nWe look upon it as a possibility\nof percentile increase.\n\n00:08:29.351 --> 00:08:34.278\nIf I change this, and take GDP per capita\ninstead of family income,\n\n00:08:34.302 --> 00:08:38.028\nand I turn these individual data\n\n00:08:38.052 --> 00:08:41.094\ninto regional data\nof gross domestic product,\n\n00:08:41.118 --> 00:08:43.419\nand I take the regions down here,\n\n00:08:43.443 --> 00:08:45.682\nthe size of the bubble\nis still the population.\n\n00:08:45.706 --> 00:08:48.904\nAnd you have the OECD there,\nand you have sub-Saharan Africa there,\n\n00:08:48.928 --> 00:08:50.934\nand we take off the Arab states there,\n\n00:08:50.958 --> 00:08:54.934\ncoming both from Africa and from Asia,\nand we put them separately,\n\n00:08:54.958 --> 00:08:59.934\nand we can expand this axis,\nand I can give it a new dimension here,\n\n00:08:59.958 --> 00:09:03.320\nby adding the social values\nthere, child survival.\n\n00:09:03.344 --> 00:09:05.508\nNow I have money on that axis,\n\n00:09:05.532 --> 00:09:08.225\nand I have the possibility\nof children to survive there.\n\n00:09:08.249 --> 00:09:12.395\nIn some countries, 99.7% of children\nsurvive to five years of age;\n\n00:09:12.419 --> 00:09:14.144\nothers, only 70.\n\n00:09:14.168 --> 00:09:17.243\nAnd here, it seems,\nthere is a gap between OECD,\n\n00:09:17.267 --> 00:09:20.512\nLatin America, East Europe, East Asia,\n\n00:09:20.536 --> 00:09:24.428\nArab states, South Asia\nand sub-Saharan Africa.\n\n00:09:24.452 --> 00:09:29.330\nThe linearity is very strong\nbetween child survival and money.\n\n00:09:29.354 --> 00:09:32.378\nBut let me split sub-Saharan Africa.\n\n00:09:32.402 --> 00:09:37.623\nHealth is there\nand better health is up there.\n\n00:09:37.647 --> 00:09:41.934\nI can go here and I can split\nsub-Saharan Africa into its countries.\n\n00:09:41.958 --> 00:09:43.535\nAnd when it burst,\n\n00:09:43.559 --> 00:09:47.205\nthe size of its country bubble\nis the size of the population.\n\n00:09:47.229 --> 00:09:49.769\nSierra Leone down there.\nMauritius is up there.\n\n00:09:49.793 --> 00:09:51.860\nMauritius was the first country\n\n00:09:51.884 --> 00:09:55.285\nto get away with trade barriers,\nand they could sell their sugar --\n\n00:09:55.309 --> 00:09:56.897\nthey could sell their textiles --\n\n00:09:56.921 --> 00:10:00.561\non equal terms as the people\nin Europe and North America.\n\n00:10:00.585 --> 00:10:04.062\nThere's a huge difference between Africa.\nAnd Ghana is here in the middle.\n\n00:10:04.086 --> 00:10:06.934\nIn Sierra Leone, humanitarian aid.\n\n00:10:06.958 --> 00:10:10.884\nHere in Uganda, development aid.\n\n00:10:10.908 --> 00:10:13.432\nHere, time to invest;\nthere, you can go for a holiday.\n\n00:10:13.456 --> 00:10:16.819\nIt's a tremendous variation within Africa\n\n00:10:16.843 --> 00:10:19.934\nwhich we rarely often make\n-- that it's equal everything.\n\n00:10:19.958 --> 00:10:23.934\nI can split South Asia here.\nIndia's the big bubble in the middle.\n\n00:10:23.958 --> 00:10:28.420\nBut a huge difference\nbetween Afghanistan and Sri Lanka.\n\n00:10:28.444 --> 00:10:30.598\nI can split Arab states. How are they?\n\n00:10:30.622 --> 00:10:34.758\nSame climate, same culture,\nsame religion -- huge difference.\n\n00:10:34.782 --> 00:10:36.115\nEven between neighbors.\n\n00:10:36.139 --> 00:10:37.455\nYemen, civil war.\n\n00:10:37.479 --> 00:10:41.822\nUnited Arab Emirates, money,\nwhich was quite equally and well used.\n\n00:10:41.846 --> 00:10:43.331\nNot as the myth is.\n\n00:10:43.355 --> 00:10:46.528\nAnd that includes all the children\nof the foreign workers\n\n00:10:46.552 --> 00:10:48.439\nwho are in the country.\n\n00:10:49.242 --> 00:10:52.934\nData is often better than you think.\nMany people say data is bad.\n\n00:10:52.958 --> 00:10:56.101\nThere is an uncertainty margin,\nbut we can see the difference here:\n\n00:10:56.125 --> 00:10:57.487\nCambodia, Singapore.\n\n00:10:57.511 --> 00:11:00.482\nThe differences are much bigger\nthan the weakness of the data.\n\n00:11:00.506 --> 00:11:05.153\nEast Europe: Soviet economy\nfor a long time,\n\n00:11:05.177 --> 00:11:08.389\nbut they come out after 10 years\nvery, very differently.\n\n00:11:08.413 --> 00:11:11.035\nAnd there is Latin America.\n\n00:11:11.059 --> 00:11:12.780\nToday, we don't have to go to Cuba\n\n00:11:12.804 --> 00:11:14.868\nto find a healthy country\nin Latin America.\n\n00:11:14.892 --> 00:11:19.526\nChile will have a lower child mortality\nthan Cuba within some few years from now.\n\n00:11:19.550 --> 00:11:22.605\nHere, we have high-income\ncountries in the OECD.\n\n00:11:22.629 --> 00:11:26.338\nAnd we get the whole pattern\nhere of the world,\n\n00:11:26.362 --> 00:11:28.408\nwhich is more or less like this.\n\n00:11:28.432 --> 00:11:33.523\nAnd if we look at it, how the world looks,\n\n00:11:33.575 --> 00:11:36.934\nin 1960, it starts to move.\n\n00:11:36.958 --> 00:11:39.527\nThis is Mao Tse-tung.\nHe brought health to China.\n\n00:11:39.551 --> 00:11:40.685\nAnd then he died.\n\n00:11:40.709 --> 00:11:43.416\nAnd then Deng Xiaoping came\nand brought money to China,\n\n00:11:43.440 --> 00:11:45.494\nand brought them\ninto the mainstream again.\n\n00:11:45.518 --> 00:11:49.676\nAnd we have seen how countries\nmove in different directions like this,\n\n00:11:49.700 --> 00:11:55.065\nso it's sort of difficult to get\nan example country\n\n00:11:55.089 --> 00:11:57.748\nwhich shows the pattern of the world.\n\n00:11:57.798 --> 00:12:04.130\nBut I would like to bring you back\nto about here, at 1960.\n\n00:12:05.041 --> 00:12:08.331\nI would like to compare\n\n00:12:08.355 --> 00:12:15.045\nSouth Korea, which is this one,\nwith Brazil, which is this one.\n\n00:12:16.145 --> 00:12:17.926\nThe label went away for me here.\n\n00:12:17.950 --> 00:12:20.546\nAnd I would like to compare Uganda,\nwhich is there.\n\n00:12:21.649 --> 00:12:24.688\nAnd I can run it forward, like this.\n\n00:12:26.371 --> 00:12:33.338\nAnd you can see how South Korea is making\na very, very fast advancement,\n\n00:12:33.362 --> 00:12:35.934\nwhereas Brazil is much slower.\n\n00:12:35.958 --> 00:12:42.292\nAnd if we move back again, here,\nand we put on trails on them, like this,\n\n00:12:42.316 --> 00:12:45.934\nyou can see again\nthat the speed of development\n\n00:12:45.958 --> 00:12:48.772\nis very, very different,\n\n00:12:48.796 --> 00:12:55.497\nand the countries are moving more or less\nin the same rate as money and health,\n\n00:12:55.521 --> 00:12:57.395\nbut it seems you can move much faster\n\n00:12:57.419 --> 00:13:00.078\nif you are healthy first\nthan if you are wealthy first.\n\n00:13:00.958 --> 00:13:04.934\nAnd to show that, you can put\non the way of United Arab Emirates.\n\n00:13:04.958 --> 00:13:07.814\nThey came from here, a mineral country.\n\n00:13:07.838 --> 00:13:10.163\nThey cached all the oil;\nthey got all the money;\n\n00:13:10.187 --> 00:13:12.426\nbut health cannot be bought\nat the supermarket.\n\n00:13:13.474 --> 00:13:16.570\nYou have to invest in health.\nYou have to get kids into schooling.\n\n00:13:16.594 --> 00:13:19.737\nYou have to train health staff.\nYou have to educate the population.\n\n00:13:19.761 --> 00:13:22.215\nAnd Sheikh Zayed did that\nin a fairly good way.\n\n00:13:22.239 --> 00:13:25.934\nIn spite of falling oil prices,\nhe brought this country up here.\n\n00:13:25.958 --> 00:13:29.934\nSo we've got a much more mainstream\nappearance of the world,\n\n00:13:29.958 --> 00:13:32.485\nwhere all countries tend\nto use their money\n\n00:13:32.509 --> 00:13:34.620\nbetter than they used in the past.\n\n00:13:35.713 --> 00:13:42.685\nNow, this is, more or less, if you look\nat the average data of the countries --\n\n00:13:42.709 --> 00:13:44.357\nthey are like this.\n\n00:13:44.381 --> 00:13:47.723\nNow that's dangerous, to use average data,\n\n00:13:47.747 --> 00:13:51.518\nbecause there is such\na lot of difference within countries.\n\n00:13:51.542 --> 00:13:57.961\nSo if I go and look here,\nwe can see that Uganda today\n\n00:13:57.985 --> 00:14:00.934\nis where South Korea was in 1960.\n\n00:14:00.958 --> 00:14:04.624\nIf I split Uganda, there's quite\na difference within Uganda.\n\n00:14:04.648 --> 00:14:06.826\nThese are the quintiles of Uganda.\n\n00:14:06.850 --> 00:14:09.034\nThe richest 20 percent\nof Ugandans are there.\n\n00:14:09.058 --> 00:14:10.443\nThe poorest are down there.\n\n00:14:10.467 --> 00:14:13.343\nIf I split South Africa, it's like this.\n\n00:14:13.367 --> 00:14:16.110\nAnd if I go down and look at Niger,\n\n00:14:16.134 --> 00:14:20.778\nwhere there was such\na terrible famine, lastly, it's like this.\n\n00:14:20.802 --> 00:14:23.696\nThe 20 percent poorest\nof Niger is out here,\n\n00:14:23.720 --> 00:14:26.489\nand the 20 percent richest\nof South Africa is there,\n\n00:14:26.513 --> 00:14:28.531\nand yet we tend to discuss\n\n00:14:28.555 --> 00:14:30.934\non what solutions\nthere should be in Africa.\n\n00:14:30.958 --> 00:14:33.525\nEverything in this world exists in Africa.\n\n00:14:33.549 --> 00:14:36.824\nAnd you can't discuss\nuniversal access to HIV [medicine]\n\n00:14:36.848 --> 00:14:41.220\nfor that quintile up here\nwith the same strategy as down here.\n\n00:14:41.244 --> 00:14:44.782\nThe improvement of the world\nmust be highly contextualized,\n\n00:14:44.806 --> 00:14:48.736\nand it's not relevant to have it\non regional level.\n\n00:14:48.760 --> 00:14:50.290\nWe must be much more detailed.\n\n00:14:51.028 --> 00:14:54.354\nWe find that students get\nvery excited when they can use this.\n\n00:14:54.378 --> 00:14:57.996\nAnd even more, policy makers\nand the corporate sectors\n\n00:14:58.020 --> 00:15:01.681\nwould like to see\nhow the world is changing.\n\n00:15:01.705 --> 00:15:03.393\nNow, why doesn't this take place?\n\n00:15:03.417 --> 00:15:05.907\nWhy are we not using the data we have?\n\n00:15:05.931 --> 00:15:09.741\nWe have data in the United Nations,\nin the national statistical agencies\n\n00:15:09.765 --> 00:15:12.934\nand in universities and other\nnon-governmental organizations.\n\n00:15:12.958 --> 00:15:15.292\nBecause the data is hidden\ndown in the databases.\n\n00:15:15.316 --> 00:15:18.248\nAnd the public is there,\nand the Internet is there,\n\n00:15:18.273 --> 00:15:20.434\nbut we have still not used it effectively.\n\n00:15:20.457 --> 00:15:22.934\nAll that information\nwe saw changing in the world\n\n00:15:22.958 --> 00:15:26.097\ndoes not include\npublicly-funded statistics.\n\n00:15:26.121 --> 00:15:28.275\nThere are some web pages\nlike this, you know,\n\n00:15:28.299 --> 00:15:32.934\nbut they take some nourishment\ndown from the databases,\n\n00:15:32.958 --> 00:15:37.934\nbut people put prices on them,\nstupid passwords and boring statistics.\n\n00:15:37.958 --> 00:15:39.347\n(Laughter)\n\n00:15:39.371 --> 00:15:40.546\nAnd this won't work.\n\n00:15:40.570 --> 00:15:43.373\n(Applause)\n\n00:15:43.397 --> 00:15:45.819\nSo what is needed? We have the databases.\n\n00:15:45.843 --> 00:15:47.620\nIt's not the new database you need.\n\n00:15:47.644 --> 00:15:51.370\nWe have wonderful design tools,\nand more and more are added up here.\n\n00:15:51.394 --> 00:15:54.265\nSo we started a nonprofit venture\n\n00:15:54.289 --> 00:15:58.660\nwhich, linking data to design,\nwe called Gapminder,\n\n00:15:58.684 --> 00:16:00.037\nfrom the London Underground,\n\n00:16:00.061 --> 00:16:01.838\nwhere they warn you, \"mind the gap.\"\n\n00:16:01.862 --> 00:16:03.802\nSo we thought Gapminder was appropriate.\n\n00:16:03.826 --> 00:16:08.182\nAnd we started to write software\nwhich could link the data like this.\n\n00:16:08.206 --> 00:16:09.753\nAnd it wasn't that difficult.\n\n00:16:09.777 --> 00:16:13.328\nIt took some person years,\nand we have produced animations.\n\n00:16:13.352 --> 00:16:15.685\nYou can take a data set and put it there.\n\n00:16:15.709 --> 00:16:19.934\nWe are liberating U.N. data,\nsome few U.N. organization.\n\n00:16:19.958 --> 00:16:24.458\nSome countries accept that\ntheir databases can go out on the world,\n\n00:16:24.482 --> 00:16:27.553\nbut what we really need is,\nof course, a search function.\n\n00:16:27.577 --> 00:16:31.934\nA search function where we can copy\nthe data up to a searchable format\n\n00:16:31.958 --> 00:16:33.690\nand get it out in the world.\n\n00:16:33.714 --> 00:16:36.085\nAnd what do we hear when we go around?\n\n00:16:36.109 --> 00:16:39.116\nI've done anthropology\non the main statistical units.\n\n00:16:39.140 --> 00:16:42.260\nEveryone says, \"It's impossible.\nThis can't be done.\n\n00:16:42.284 --> 00:16:44.794\nOur information is so peculiar in detail,\n\n00:16:44.818 --> 00:16:47.922\nso that cannot be searched\nas others can be searched.\n\n00:16:47.946 --> 00:16:50.301\nWe cannot give the data\nfree to the students,\n\n00:16:50.325 --> 00:16:52.230\nfree to the entrepreneurs of the world.\"\n\n00:16:53.214 --> 00:16:56.109\nBut this is what we would\nlike to see, isn't it?\n\n00:16:56.133 --> 00:16:58.557\nThe publicly-funded data is down here.\n\n00:16:58.581 --> 00:17:01.616\nAnd we would like flowers\nto grow out on the Net.\n\n00:17:01.640 --> 00:17:04.807\nAnd one of the crucial points\nis to make them searchable,\n\n00:17:04.831 --> 00:17:09.075\nand then people can use the different\ndesign tool to animate it there.\n\n00:17:09.099 --> 00:17:11.539\nAnd I have pretty good news for you.\n\n00:17:11.563 --> 00:17:13.757\nI have good news that the present,\n\n00:17:13.781 --> 00:17:16.934\nnew Head of U.N. Statistics,\nhe doesn't say it's impossible.\n\n00:17:16.958 --> 00:17:18.730\nHe only says, \"We can't do it.\"\n\n00:17:19.730 --> 00:17:22.934\n(Laughter)\n\n00:17:22.958 --> 00:17:24.934\nAnd that's a quite clever guy, huh?\n\n00:17:24.958 --> 00:17:26.934\n(Laughter)\n\n00:17:26.958 --> 00:17:30.934\nSo we can see a lot happening\nin data in the coming years.\n\n00:17:30.958 --> 00:17:35.618\nWe will be able to look at income\ndistributions in completely new ways.\n\n00:17:35.642 --> 00:17:40.934\nThis is the income distribution\nof China, 1970.\n\n00:17:40.958 --> 00:17:45.754\nThis is the income distribution\nof the United States, 1970.\n\n00:17:45.778 --> 00:17:48.827\nAlmost no overlap.\n\n00:17:48.851 --> 00:17:50.301\nAnd what has happened?\n\n00:17:50.631 --> 00:17:52.309\nWhat has happened is this:\n\n00:17:52.333 --> 00:17:55.305\nthat China is growing,\nit's not so equal any longer,\n\n00:17:55.329 --> 00:17:58.934\nand it's appearing here,\noverlooking the United States.\n\n00:17:58.958 --> 00:18:01.616\nAlmost like a ghost, isn't it?\n\n00:18:01.640 --> 00:18:02.934\n(Laughter)\n\n00:18:02.958 --> 00:18:04.545\nIt's pretty scary.\n\n00:18:04.569 --> 00:18:06.830\n(Laughter)\n\n00:18:09.720 --> 00:18:13.530\nBut I think it's very important\nto have all this information.\n\n00:18:13.554 --> 00:18:16.167\nWe need really to see it.\n\n00:18:16.191 --> 00:18:18.934\nAnd instead of looking at this,\n\n00:18:18.958 --> 00:18:24.606\nI would like to end up by showing\nthe Internet users per 1,000.\n\n00:18:24.630 --> 00:18:27.512\nIn this software, we access\nabout 500 variables\n\n00:18:27.536 --> 00:18:29.937\nfrom all the countries quite easily.\n\n00:18:29.961 --> 00:18:32.934\nIt takes some time to change for this,\n\n00:18:32.958 --> 00:18:38.813\nbut on the axises, you can quite easily\nget any variable you would like to have.\n\n00:18:38.837 --> 00:18:43.344\nAnd the thing would be\nto get up the databases free,\n\n00:18:43.368 --> 00:18:45.934\nto get them searchable,\nand with a second click,\n\n00:18:45.958 --> 00:18:50.934\nto get them into the graphic formats,\nwhere you can instantly understand them.\n\n00:18:50.958 --> 00:18:53.060\nNow, statisticians don't like it,\n\n00:18:53.084 --> 00:19:00.052\nbecause they say\nthat this will not show the reality;\n\n00:19:00.076 --> 00:19:03.797\nwe have to have statistical,\nanalytical methods.\n\n00:19:03.821 --> 00:19:05.934\nBut this is hypothesis-generating.\n\n00:19:05.958 --> 00:19:07.863\nI end now with the world.\n\n00:19:08.979 --> 00:19:10.464\nThere, the Internet is coming.\n\n00:19:10.488 --> 00:19:12.971\nThe number of Internet users\nare going up like this.\n\n00:19:12.995 --> 00:19:14.964\nThis is the GDP per capita.\n\n00:19:14.988 --> 00:19:18.473\nAnd it's a new technology coming in,\nbut then amazingly,\n\n00:19:18.497 --> 00:19:22.216\nhow well it fits to the economy\nof the countries.\n\n00:19:22.240 --> 00:19:25.697\nThat's why the $100 computer\nwill be so important.\n\n00:19:25.721 --> 00:19:27.126\nBut it's a nice tendency.\n\n00:19:27.150 --> 00:19:30.054\nIt's as if the world\nis flattening off, isn't it?\n\n00:19:30.078 --> 00:19:32.483\nThese countries are lifting more\nthan the economy\n\n00:19:32.507 --> 00:19:35.292\nand will be very interesting\nto follow this over the year,\n\n00:19:35.316 --> 00:19:38.677\nas I would like you to be able to do\nwith all the publicly funded data.\n\n00:19:38.701 --> 00:19:39.934\nThank you very much.\n\n00:19:39.958 --> 00:19:42.958\n(Applause)"}, {"title": "Why we do what we do", "duration": "1305", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/tony_robbins_asks_why_we_do_what_we_do", "transcript": "Thank you. I have to tell you I'm both challenged and excited. My excitement is: I get a chance to give something back. My challenge is: the shortest seminar I usually do is 50 hours.(Laughter)I'm not exaggerating. I do weekends \u2014 I do more, obviously, I also coach people \u2014 but I'm into immersion, because how did you learn language? Not just by learning principles, you got in it and you did it so often that it became real.The bottom line of why I'm here, besides being a crazy mofo, is that \u2014 I'm not here to motivate you, you don't need that, obviously. Often that's what people think I do, and it's the furthest thing from it. What happens, though, is people say to me, \"I don't need any motivation.\" But that's not what I do. I'm the \"why\" guy. I want to know why you do what you do.What is your motive for action? What is it that drives you in your life today? Not 10 years ago. Are you running the same pattern? Because I believe that the invisible force of internal drive, activated, is the most important thing. I'm here because I believe emotion is the force of life. All of us here have great minds. Most of us here have great minds, right? We all know how to think. With our minds we can rationalize anything. We can make anything happen.I agree with what was described a few days ago, that people work in their self-interest. But we know that that's bullshit at times. You don't work in your self-interest all the time, because when emotion comes into it, the wiring changes in the way it functions. So it's wonderful to think intellectually about how the life of the world is, especially those who are very smart can play this game in our head. But I really want to know what's driving you.What I would like to invite you to do by the end of this talk is explore where you are today, for two reasons. One: so that you can contribute more. And two: that hopefully we can not just understand other people more, but appreciate them more, and create the kinds of connections that can stop some of the challenges that we face today. They're only going to get magnified by the very technology that connects us, because it's making us intersect. That intersection doesn't always create a view of \"everybody now understands everybody, and everybody appreciates everybody.\"I've had an obsession basically for 30 years, \"What makes the difference in the quality of people's lives? What in their performance?\" I got hired to produce the result now. I've done it for 30 years. I get the phone call when the athlete is burning down on national television, and they were ahead by five strokes and now they can't get back on the course. I've got to do something right now or nothing matters. I get the phone call when the child is going to commit suicide, I've got to do something. In 29 years, I'm very grateful to tell you I've never lost one. It doesn't mean I won't some day, but I haven't yet. The reason is an understanding of these human needs.When I get those calls about performance, that's one thing. How do you make a change? I'm also looking to see what is shaping the person's ability to contribute, to do something beyond themselves. Maybe the real question is, I look at life and say there's two master lessons. One is: there's the science of achievement, which almost everyone here has mastered amazingly. \"How do you take the invisible and make it visible,\" How do you make your dreams happen? Your business, your contribution to society, money \u2014 whatever, your body, your family.The other lesson that is rarely mastered is the art of fulfillment. Because science is easy, right? We know the rules, you write the code and you get the results. Once you know the game, you just up the ante, don't you? But when it comes to fulfillment \u2014 that's an art. The reason is, it's about appreciation and contribution. You can only feel so much by yourself.I've had an interesting laboratory to try to answer the real question how somebody's life changes if you look at them like those people that you've given everything to? Like all the resources they say they need. You gave not a 100-dollar computer, but the best computer. You gave them love, joy, were there to comfort them. Those people very often \u2014 you know some of them \u2014 end up the rest of their life with all this love, education, money and background going in and out of rehab. Some people have been through ultimate pain, psychologically, sexually, spiritually, emotionally abused \u2014 and not always, but often, they become some of the people that contribute the most to society.The question we've got to ask ourselves really is, what is it? What is it that shapes us? We live in a therapy culture. Most of us don't do that, but the culture's a therapy culture, the mindset that we are our past. And you wouldn't be in this room if you bought that, but most of society thinks biography is destiny. The past equals the future. Of course it does if you live there. But what we know and what we have to remind ourselves \u2014 because you can know something intellectually and then not use it, not apply it.We've got to remind ourselves that decision is the ultimate power. When you ask people, have you failed to achieve something significant in your life?Say, \"Aye.\" Audience: Aye.TR: Thanks for the interaction on a high level there. But if you ask people, why didn't you achieve something? Somebody who's working for you, or a partner, or even yourself. When you fail to achieve, what's the reason people say? What do they tell you? Didn't have the knowledge, didn't have the money, didn't have the time, didn't have the technology. I didn't have the right manager.Al Gore: Supreme Court. TR: The Supreme Court.(Laughter)(Applause) (Cheering)(Applause continues)TR: And \u2014(Applause)What do all those, including the Supreme Court, have in common?(Laughter)They are a claim to you missing resources, and they may be accurate. You may not have the money, or the Supreme Court, but that is not the defining factor.(Applause) (Laughter)And you correct me if I'm wrong. The defining factor is never resources; it's resourcefulness. And what I mean specifically, rather than just some phrase, is if you have emotion, human emotion, something that I experienced from you the day before yesterday at a level that is as profound as I've ever experienced and I believe with that emotion you would have beat his ass and won.Audience: Yeah!(Applause) (Cheering)How easy for me to tell him what he should do.(Laughter)Idiot, Robbins. But I know when we watched the debate at that time, there were emotions that blocked people's ability to get this man's intellect and capacity. And the way that it came across to some people on that day \u2014 because I know people that wanted to vote in your direction and didn't, and I was upset. But there was emotion there. Do you know what I'm talking about?Say, \"Aye.\" Audience: Aye.TR: So, emotion is it. And if we get the right emotion, we can get ourselves to do anything. If you're creative, playful, fun enough, can you get through to anybody, yes or no?If you don't have the money, but you're creative and determined, you find the way. This is the ultimate resource. But this is not the story that people tell us. They tell us a bunch of different stories. They tell us we don't have the resources, but ultimately, if you take a look here, they say, what are all the reasons they haven't accomplished that? He's broken my pattern, that son-of-a-bitch.(Laughter)But I appreciated the energy, I'll tell you that.(Laughter)What determines your resources? We've said decisions shape destiny, which is my focus here. If decisions shape destiny, what determines it is three decisions. What will you focus on? You have to decide what you're going to focus on. Consciously or unconsciously. the minute you decide to focus, you must give it a meaning, and that meaning produces emotion. Is this the end or the beginning? Is God punishing me or rewarding me, or is this the roll of the dice? An emotion creates what we're going to do, or the action.So, think about your own life, the decisions that have shaped your destiny. And that sounds really heavy, but in the last five or 10 years, have there been some decisions that if you'd made a different decision, your life would be completely different? How many can think about it? Better or worse. Say, \"Aye.\"Audience: Aye.So the bottom line is, maybe it was where to go to work, and you met the love of your life there, a career decision. I know the Google geniuses I saw here \u2014 I mean, I understand that their decision was to sell their technology. What if they made that decision versus to build their own culture? How would the world or their lives be different, their impact? The history of our world is these decisions. When a woman stands up and says, \"No, I won't go to the back of the bus.\" She didn't just affect her life. That decision shaped our culture. Or someone standing in front of a tank. Or being in a position like Lance Armstrong, \"You've got testicular cancer.\" That's pretty tough for any male, especially if you ride a bike.(Laughter)You've got it in your brain; you've got it in your lungs. But what was his decision of what to focus on? Different than most people. What did it mean? It wasn't the end; it was the beginning. He goes off and wins seven championships he never once won before the cancer, because he got emotional fitness, psychological strength. That's the difference in human beings that I've seen of the three million I've been around.In my lab, I've had three million people from 80 countries over the last 29 years. And after a while, patterns become obvious. You see that South America and Africa may be connected in a certain way, right? Others say, \"Oh, that sounds ridiculous.\" It's simple. So, what shaped Lance? What shapes you? Two invisible forces. Very quickly. One: state. We all have had times, you did something, and after, you thought to yourself, \"I can't believe I said or did that, that was so stupid.\" Who's been there? Say, \"Aye.\" Audience: Aye.Or after you did something, you go, \"That was me!\"(Laughter)It wasn't your ability; it was your state. Your model of the world is what shapes you long term. Your model of the world is the filter. That's what's shaping us. It makes people make decisions. To influence somebody, we need to know what already influences them. It's made up of three parts. First, what's your target? What are you after? It's not your desires. You can get your desires or goals. Who has ever got a goal or desire and thought, is this all there is?Say, \"Aye.\" Audience: Aye.It's needs we have. I believe there are six human needs. Second, once you know what the target that's driving you is and you uncover it for the truth \u2014 you don't form it \u2014 then you find out what's your map, what's the belief systems that tell you how to get those needs. Some people think the way to get them is to destroy the world, some people, to build, create something, love someone. There's the fuel you pick. So very quickly, six needs.Let me tell you what they are. First one: certainty. These are not goals or desires, these are universal. Everyone needs certainty they can avoid pain and at least be comfortable. Now, how do you get it? Control everybody? Develop a skill? Give up? Smoke a cigarette? And if you got totally certain, ironically, even though we need that \u2014 you're not certain about your health, or your children, or money. If you're not sure the ceiling will hold up, you won't listen to any speaker. While we go for certainty differently, if we get total certainty, we get what? What do you feel if you're certain? You know what will happen, when and how it will happen, what would you feel? Bored out of your minds. So, God, in Her infinite wisdom, gave us a second human need, which is uncertainty. We need variety. We need surprise. How many of you here love surprises? Say, \"Aye.\"Audience: Aye.TR: Bullshit. You like the surprises you want. The ones you don't want, you call problems, but you need them. So, variety is important. Have you ever rented a video or a film that you've already seen? Who's done this? Get a fucking life.(Laughter)Why are you doing it? You're certain it's good because you read or saw it before, but you're hoping it's been long enough you've forgotten, and there's variety.Third human need, critical: significance. We all need to feel important, special, unique. You can get it by making more money or being more spiritual. You can do it by getting yourself in a situation where you put more tattoos and earrings in places humans don't want to know. Whatever it takes. The fastest way to do this, if you have no background, no culture, no belief and resources or resourcefulness, is violence. If I put a gun to your head and I live in the 'hood, instantly I'm significant. Zero to 10. How high? 10. How certain am I that you're going to respond to me? 10. How much uncertainty? Who knows what's going to happen next? Kind of exciting. Like climbing up into a cave and doing that stuff all the way down there. Total variety and uncertainty. And it's significant, isn't it? So you want to risk your life for it. So that's why violence has always been around and will be around unless we have a consciousness change as a species. You can get significance a million ways, but to be significant, you've got to be unique and different.Here's what we really need: connection and love, fourth need. We all want it; most settle for connection, love's too scary. Who here has been hurt in an intimate relationship? If you don't raise your hand, you've had other shit, too. And you're going to get hurt again. Aren't you glad you came to this positive visit? Here's what's true: we need it. We can do it through intimacy, friendship, prayer, through walking in nature. If nothing else works for you, don't get a cat, get a dog, because if you leave for two minutes, it's like you've been gone six months, when you come back 5 minutes later.These first four needs, every human finds a way to meet. Even if you lie to yourself, you need to have split personalities. I call the first four needs the needs of the personality. The last two are the needs of the spirit. And this is where fulfillment comes. You won't get it from the first four. You'll figure a way, smoke, drink, do whatever, meet the first four. But number five, you must grow. We all know the answer. If you don't grow, you're what? If a relationship or business is not growing, if you're not growing, doesn't matter how much money or friends you have, how many love you, you feel like hell. And I believe the reason we grow is so we have something to give of value.Because the sixth need is to contribute beyond ourselves. Because we all know, corny as that sounds, the secret to living is giving. We all know life is not about me, it's about we. This culture knows that, this room knows that. It's exciting. When you see Nicholas talking about his $100 computer, the most exciting thing is: here's a genius, but he's got a calling now. You can feel the difference in him, and it's beautiful. And that calling can touch other people.My life was touched because when I was 11 years old, Thanksgiving, no money, no food, we were not going to starve, but my father was totally messed up, my mom was letting him know how bad he messed up, and somebody came to the door and delivered food. My father made three decisions, I know what they were, briefly. His focus was \"This is charity. What does it mean? I'm worthless. What do I have to do? Leave my family,\" which he did. It was one of the most painful experiences of life. My three decisions gave me a different path. I set focus on \"There's food.\" What a concept!(Laughter)But this is what changed my life, shaped me as a human being. Somebody's gift, I don't even know who it is. My father always said, \"No one gives a shit.\" And now somebody I don't know, they're not asking for anything, just giving us food, looking out for us. It made me believe this: that strangers care. And that made me decide, if strangers care about me and my family, I care about them. I'm going to do something to make a difference. So when I was 17, I went out on Thanksgiving, it was my target for years to have enough money to feed two families. The most fun and moving thing I ever did in my life. Next year, I did four, then eight. I didn't tell anybody what I was doing, I wasn't doing it for brownie points. But after eight, I thought I could use some help.So I went out, got my friends involved, then I grew companies, got 11, and I built the foundation. 18 years later, I'm proud to tell you last year we fed 2 million people in 35 countries through our foundation. All during the holidays, Thanksgiving, Christmas, in different countries around the world.(Applause)Thank you. I don't tell you that to brag, but because I'm proud of human beings because they get excited to contribute once they've had the chance to experience it, not talk about it.So, finally \u2014 I'm about out of time. The target that shapes you \u2014 Here's what's different about people. We have the same needs. But are you a certainty freak, is that what you value most, or uncertainty? This man couldn't be a certainty freak if he climbed through those caves. Are you driven by significance or love? We all need all six, but what your lead system is tilts you in a different direction. And as you move in a direction, you have a destination or destiny. The second piece is the map. The operating system tells you how to get there, and some people's map is, \"I'm going to save lives even if I die for other people,\" and they're a fireman, and somebody else says, \"I'm going to kill people to do it.\" They're trying to meet the same needs of significance. They want to honor God or honor their family. But they have a different map.And there are seven different beliefs; I can't go through them, because I'm done. The last piece is emotion. One of the parts of the map is like time. Some people's idea of a long time is 100 years. Somebody else's is three seconds, which is what I have. And the last one I've already mentioned that fell to you. If you've got a target and a map \u2014 I can't use Google because I love Macs, and they haven't made it good for Macs yet. So if you use MapQuest \u2014 how many have made this fatal mistake of using it? You use this thing and you don't get there. Imagine if your beliefs guarantee you can never get to where you want to go.(Laughter)The last thing is emotion. Here's what I'll tell you about emotion. There are 6,000 emotions that we have words for in the English language, which is just a linguistic representation that changes by language. But if your dominant emotions \u2014 If I have 20,000 people or 1,000 and I have them write down all the emotions that they experience in an average week, and I give them as long as they need, and on one side they write empowering emotions, the other's disempowering, guess how many emotions they experience? Less than 12. And half of those make them feel like shit. They have six good feelings. Happy, happy, excited, oh shit, frustrated, frustrated, overwhelmed, depressed. How many of you know somebody who, no matter what happens, finds a way to get pissed off?(Laughter)Or no matter what happens, they find a way to be happy or excited. How many of you know somebody like this?When 9/11 happened, I'll finish with this, I was in Hawaii. I was with 2,000 people from 45 countries, we were translating four languages simultaneously for a program I was conducting, for a week. The night before was called Emotional Mastery. I got up, had no plan for this, and I said \u2014 we had fireworks, I do crazy shit, fun stuff, and at the end, I stopped. I had this plan, but I never know what I'm going to say. And all of a sudden, I said, \"When do people really start to live? When they face death.\" And I went through this whole thing about, if you weren't going to get off this island, if nine days from now, you were going to die, who would you call, what would you say, what would you do? That night is when 9/11 happened.One woman had come to the seminar, and when she came there, her previous boyfriend had been kidnapped and murdered. Her new boyfriend wanted to marry her, and she said no.He said, \"If you go to that Hawaii thing, it's over with us.\" She said, \"It's over.\" When I finished that night, she called him and left a message at the top of the World Trade Center where he worked, saying, \"I love you, I want you to know I want to marry you. It was stupid of me.\" She was asleep, because it was 3 a.m. for us, when he called her back, and said, \"Honey, I can't tell you what this means. I don't know how to tell you this, but you gave me the greatest gift, because I'm going to die.\" And she played the recording for us in the room. She was on Larry King later. And he said, \"You're probably wondering how on Earth this could happen to you twice. All I can say is this must be God's message to you. From now on, every day, give your all, love your all. Don't let anything ever stop you.\" She finishes, and a man stands up, and he says, \"I'm from Pakistan, I'm a Muslim. I'd love to hold your hand and say I'm sorry, but frankly, this is retribution.\" I can't tell you the rest, because I'm out of time.(Laughter)Are you sure?(Laughter)10 seconds!(Laughter and applause)10 seconds, I want to be respectful. All I can tell you is, I brought this man on stage with a man from New York who worked in the World Trade Center, because I had about 200 New Yorkers there. More than 50 lost their entire companies, friends, marking off their Palm Pilots. One financial trader, woman made of steel, bawling \u2014 30 friends crossing off that all died. And I said, \"What are we going to focus on? What does this mean and what are we going to do?\"And I got the group to focus on: if you didn't lose somebody today, your focus is going to be how to serve somebody else. Then one woman stood up and was so angry, screaming and yelling. I found out she wasn't from New York, she's not an American, doesn't know anybody here. I asked, \"Do you always get angry?\" She said, \"Yes.\" Guilty people got guilty, sad people got sad. I took these two men and I did an indirect negotiation. Jewish man with family in the occupied territory, someone in New York who would have died if he was at work that day, and this man who wanted to be a terrorist, and I made it very clear. This integration is on a film, which I'd be happy to send you, instead of my verbalization, but the two of them not only came together and changed their beliefs and models of the world, but worked together to bring, for almost four years now, through various mosques and synagogues, the idea of how to create peace. And he wrote a book, called \"My Jihad, My Way of Peace.\" So, transformation can happen.My invitation to you is: explore your web, the web in here \u2014 the needs, the beliefs, the emotions that are controlling you, for two reasons: so there's more of you to give, and achieve, too, but I mean give, because that's what's going to fill you up. And secondly, so you can appreciate \u2014 not just understand, that's intellectual, that's the mind, but appreciate what's driving other people. It's the only way our world's going to change.God bless you, thank you. I hope this was of service.(Applause)", "id": 96, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:13.958 --> 00:00:17.436\nThank you. I have to tell you\nI'm both challenged and excited.\n\n00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:20.372\nMy excitement is: I get a chance\nto give something back.\n\n00:00:20.396 --> 00:00:23.934\nMy challenge is: the shortest seminar\nI usually do is 50 hours.\n\n00:00:23.958 --> 00:00:25.583\n(Laughter)\n\n00:00:25.607 --> 00:00:27.837\nI'm not exaggerating. I do weekends --\n\n00:00:27.861 --> 00:00:30.096\nI do more, obviously,\nI also coach people --\n\n00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:32.891\nbut I'm into immersion,\nbecause how did you learn language?\n\n00:00:32.915 --> 00:00:34.520\nNot just by learning principles,\n\n00:00:34.544 --> 00:00:37.397\nyou got in it and you did it\nso often that it became real.\n\n00:00:37.421 --> 00:00:40.898\nThe bottom line of why I'm here,\nbesides being a crazy mofo, is that --\n\n00:00:40.922 --> 00:00:44.661\nI'm not here to motivate you,\nyou don't need that, obviously.\n\n00:00:44.685 --> 00:00:46.708\nOften that's what people think I do,\n\n00:00:46.732 --> 00:00:48.447\nand it's the furthest thing from it.\n\n00:00:48.471 --> 00:00:50.516\nWhat happens, though, is people say to me,\n\n00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:52.008\n\"I don't need any motivation.\"\n\n00:00:52.033 --> 00:00:53.575\nBut that's not what I do.\n\n00:00:53.599 --> 00:00:55.466\nI'm the \"why\" guy.\n\n00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:57.562\nI want to know why you do what you do.\n\n00:00:57.586 --> 00:00:59.411\nWhat is your motive for action?\n\n00:01:00.093 --> 00:01:03.271\nWhat is it that drives you\nin your life today? Not 10 years ago.\n\n00:01:03.295 --> 00:01:05.000\nAre you running the same pattern?\n\n00:01:05.024 --> 00:01:08.936\nBecause I believe that the invisible force\nof internal drive, activated,\n\n00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:10.768\nis the most important thing.\n\n00:01:10.792 --> 00:01:14.371\nI'm here because I believe\nemotion is the force of life.\n\n00:01:14.395 --> 00:01:16.212\nAll of us here have great minds.\n\n00:01:16.236 --> 00:01:18.664\nMost of us here have great minds, right?\n\n00:01:18.688 --> 00:01:21.048\nWe all know how to think.\n\n00:01:21.072 --> 00:01:23.161\nWith our minds we can\nrationalize anything.\n\n00:01:23.185 --> 00:01:24.527\nWe can make anything happen.\n\n00:01:24.551 --> 00:01:27.329\nI agree with what was described\na few days ago,\n\n00:01:27.353 --> 00:01:29.680\nthat people work in their self-interest.\n\n00:01:29.704 --> 00:01:32.322\nBut we know that that's bullshit at times.\n\n00:01:32.346 --> 00:01:34.710\nYou don't work in your\nself-interest all the time,\n\n00:01:34.734 --> 00:01:36.601\nbecause when emotion comes into it,\n\n00:01:36.625 --> 00:01:38.668\nthe wiring changes\nin the way it functions.\n\n00:01:38.692 --> 00:01:42.643\nSo it's wonderful to think intellectually\nabout how the life of the world is,\n\n00:01:42.667 --> 00:01:45.826\nespecially those who are very smart\ncan play this game in our head.\n\n00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:47.952\nBut I really want to know\nwhat's driving you.\n\n00:01:47.976 --> 00:01:49.834\nWhat I would like to invite you to do\n\n00:01:49.858 --> 00:01:53.364\nby the end of this talk is explore\nwhere you are today, for two reasons.\n\n00:01:53.388 --> 00:01:55.269\nOne: so that you can contribute more.\n\n00:01:55.293 --> 00:01:58.563\nAnd two: that hopefully we can not just\nunderstand other people more,\n\n00:01:58.587 --> 00:02:01.477\nbut appreciate them more,\nand create the kinds of connections\n\n00:02:01.501 --> 00:02:04.424\nthat can stop some of the challenges\nthat we face today.\n\n00:02:04.448 --> 00:02:08.193\nThey're only going to get magnified\nby the very technology that connects us,\n\n00:02:08.217 --> 00:02:10.003\nbecause it's making us intersect.\n\n00:02:10.027 --> 00:02:12.253\nThat intersection\ndoesn't always create a view\n\n00:02:12.277 --> 00:02:14.463\nof \"everybody now understands everybody,\n\n00:02:14.487 --> 00:02:16.851\nand everybody appreciates everybody.\"\n\n00:02:16.875 --> 00:02:19.466\nI've had an obsession\nbasically for 30 years,\n\n00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:23.805\n\"What makes the difference\nin the quality of people's lives?\n\n00:02:23.829 --> 00:02:25.286\nWhat in their performance?\"\n\n00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:27.488\nI got hired to produce the result now.\n\n00:02:27.512 --> 00:02:29.008\nI've done it for 30 years.\n\n00:02:29.032 --> 00:02:30.579\nI get the phone call\n\n00:02:30.603 --> 00:02:33.345\nwhen the athlete is burning down\non national television,\n\n00:02:33.369 --> 00:02:35.055\nand they were ahead by five strokes\n\n00:02:35.079 --> 00:02:37.079\nand now they can't get back on the course.\n\n00:02:37.103 --> 00:02:39.789\nI've got to do something right now\nor nothing matters.\n\n00:02:39.813 --> 00:02:42.785\nI get the phone call when the child\nis going to commit suicide,\n\n00:02:42.809 --> 00:02:44.256\nI've got to do something.\n\n00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:47.934\nIn 29 years, I'm very grateful\nto tell you I've never lost one.\n\n00:02:47.958 --> 00:02:50.462\nIt doesn't mean I won't some day,\nbut I haven't yet.\n\n00:02:50.486 --> 00:02:53.862\nThe reason is an understanding\nof these human needs.\n\n00:02:53.886 --> 00:02:56.997\nWhen I get those calls\nabout performance, that's one thing.\n\n00:02:57.021 --> 00:02:58.507\nHow do you make a change?\n\n00:02:58.531 --> 00:03:02.526\nI'm also looking to see what is shaping\nthe person's ability to contribute,\n\n00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:06.060\nto do something beyond themselves.\n\n00:03:06.084 --> 00:03:08.192\nMaybe the real question is,\n\n00:03:08.216 --> 00:03:10.587\nI look at life and say\nthere's two master lessons.\n\n00:03:10.611 --> 00:03:12.690\nOne is: there's the science\nof achievement,\n\n00:03:12.714 --> 00:03:15.484\nwhich almost everyone here\nhas mastered amazingly.\n\n00:03:15.508 --> 00:03:18.003\n\"How do you take the invisible\nand make it visible,\"\n\n00:03:18.027 --> 00:03:19.744\nHow do you make your dreams happen?\n\n00:03:19.768 --> 00:03:22.355\nYour business, your contribution\nto society, money --\n\n00:03:22.379 --> 00:03:24.091\nwhatever, your body, your family.\n\n00:03:24.115 --> 00:03:27.618\nThe other lesson that is rarely\nmastered is the art of fulfillment.\n\n00:03:28.475 --> 00:03:30.051\nBecause science is easy, right?\n\n00:03:30.075 --> 00:03:32.980\nWe know the rules, you write the code\nand you get the results.\n\n00:03:33.004 --> 00:03:36.148\nOnce you know the game,\nyou just up the ante, don't you?\n\n00:03:36.172 --> 00:03:38.605\nBut when it comes\nto fulfillment -- that's an art.\n\n00:03:38.629 --> 00:03:41.825\nThe reason is, it's about\nappreciation and contribution.\n\n00:03:41.849 --> 00:03:43.934\nYou can only feel so much by yourself.\n\n00:03:43.958 --> 00:03:47.894\nI've had an interesting laboratory\nto try to answer the real question\n\n00:03:47.918 --> 00:03:49.474\nhow somebody's life changes\n\n00:03:49.498 --> 00:03:52.809\nif you look at them like those people\nthat you've given everything to?\n\n00:03:52.833 --> 00:03:54.957\nLike all the resources they say they need.\n\n00:03:54.981 --> 00:03:57.767\nYou gave not a 100-dollar computer,\nbut the best computer.\n\n00:03:57.791 --> 00:04:00.313\nYou gave them love, joy,\nwere there to comfort them.\n\n00:04:00.337 --> 00:04:02.933\nThose people very often --\nyou know some of them --\n\n00:04:02.957 --> 00:04:04.398\nend up the rest of their life\n\n00:04:04.422 --> 00:04:06.847\nwith all this love, education,\nmoney and background\n\n00:04:06.871 --> 00:04:08.255\ngoing in and out of rehab.\n\n00:04:08.958 --> 00:04:11.934\nSome people have been\nthrough ultimate pain,\n\n00:04:11.958 --> 00:04:15.333\npsychologically, sexually,\nspiritually, emotionally abused --\n\n00:04:15.357 --> 00:04:17.013\nand not always, but often,\n\n00:04:17.037 --> 00:04:20.241\nthey become some of the people\nthat contribute the most to society.\n\n00:04:20.265 --> 00:04:24.197\nThe question we've got to ask\nourselves really is, what is it?\n\n00:04:24.221 --> 00:04:25.564\nWhat is it that shapes us?\n\n00:04:25.588 --> 00:04:27.199\nWe live in a therapy culture.\n\n00:04:27.223 --> 00:04:30.265\nMost of us don't do that,\nbut the culture's a therapy culture,\n\n00:04:30.289 --> 00:04:32.278\nthe mindset that we are our past.\n\n00:04:32.302 --> 00:04:34.934\nAnd you wouldn't be in this room\nif you bought that,\n\n00:04:34.958 --> 00:04:38.136\nbut most of society\nthinks biography is destiny.\n\n00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:39.803\nThe past equals the future.\n\n00:04:39.827 --> 00:04:41.542\nOf course it does if you live there.\n\n00:04:41.566 --> 00:04:44.234\nBut what we know and what\nwe have to remind ourselves --\n\n00:04:44.258 --> 00:04:46.452\nbecause you can know\nsomething intellectually\n\n00:04:46.476 --> 00:04:48.324\nand then not use it, not apply it.\n\n00:04:48.878 --> 00:04:52.586\nWe've got to remind ourselves\nthat decision is the ultimate power.\n\n00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:55.314\nWhen you ask people,\n\n00:04:55.338 --> 00:04:59.211\nhave you failed to achieve\nsomething significant in your life?\n\n00:04:59.235 --> 00:05:00.934\nSay, \"Aye.\" Audience: Aye.\n\n00:05:00.958 --> 00:05:03.934\nTR: Thanks for the interaction\non a high level there.\n\n00:05:03.958 --> 00:05:06.934\nBut if you ask people,\nwhy didn't you achieve something?\n\n00:05:06.958 --> 00:05:10.213\nSomebody who's working for you,\nor a partner, or even yourself.\n\n00:05:10.237 --> 00:05:13.333\nWhen you fail to achieve,\nwhat's the reason people say?\n\n00:05:13.357 --> 00:05:14.500\nWhat do they tell you?\n\n00:05:14.524 --> 00:05:18.833\nDidn't have the knowledge,\ndidn't have the money,\n\n00:05:18.857 --> 00:05:23.094\ndidn't have the time,\ndidn't have the technology.\n\n00:05:23.118 --> 00:05:24.952\nI didn't have the right manager.\n\n00:05:24.976 --> 00:05:27.665\nAl Gore: Supreme Court.\nTR: The Supreme Court.\n\n00:05:27.689 --> 00:05:29.919\n(Laughter)\n\n00:05:29.943 --> 00:05:32.491\n(Applause) (Cheering)\n\n00:05:41.958 --> 00:05:43.934\n(Applause continues)\n\n00:05:43.958 --> 00:05:45.013\nTR: And --\n\n00:05:45.037 --> 00:05:47.935\n(Applause)\n\n00:05:47.959 --> 00:05:51.055\nWhat do all those, including\nthe Supreme Court, have in common?\n\n00:05:51.079 --> 00:05:52.453\n(Laughter)\n\n00:05:52.477 --> 00:05:57.277\nThey are a claim to you missing\nresources, and they may be accurate.\n\n00:05:57.301 --> 00:05:59.934\nYou may not have the money,\nor the Supreme Court,\n\n00:05:59.958 --> 00:06:01.934\nbut that is not the defining factor.\n\n00:06:01.958 --> 00:06:07.915\n(Applause) (Laughter)\n\n00:06:07.958 --> 00:06:09.482\nAnd you correct me if I'm wrong.\n\n00:06:10.672 --> 00:06:13.934\nThe defining factor is never resources;\nit's resourcefulness.\n\n00:06:13.958 --> 00:06:16.762\nAnd what I mean specifically,\nrather than just some phrase,\n\n00:06:16.786 --> 00:06:19.998\nis if you have emotion, human emotion,\n\n00:06:20.022 --> 00:06:24.051\nsomething that I experienced from you\nthe day before yesterday\n\n00:06:24.075 --> 00:06:26.666\nat a level that is as profound\nas I've ever experienced\n\n00:06:26.690 --> 00:06:29.928\nand I believe with that emotion\nyou would have beat his ass and won.\n\n00:06:29.952 --> 00:06:31.009\nAudience: Yeah!\n\n00:06:31.033 --> 00:06:35.700\n(Applause) (Cheering)\n\n00:06:35.724 --> 00:06:37.934\nHow easy for me to tell him\nwhat he should do.\n\n00:06:37.958 --> 00:06:39.934\n(Laughter)\n\n00:06:39.958 --> 00:06:42.845\nIdiot, Robbins.\n\n00:06:42.869 --> 00:06:48.125\nBut I know when we watched\nthe debate at that time,\n\n00:06:48.149 --> 00:06:50.436\nthere were emotions\nthat blocked people's ability\n\n00:06:50.460 --> 00:06:52.437\nto get this man's intellect and capacity.\n\n00:06:52.461 --> 00:06:55.357\nAnd the way that it came across\nto some people on that day --\n\n00:06:55.381 --> 00:06:58.756\nbecause I know people that wanted\nto vote in your direction and didn't,\n\n00:06:58.780 --> 00:07:00.123\nand I was upset.\n\n00:07:00.147 --> 00:07:01.586\nBut there was emotion there.\n\n00:07:01.610 --> 00:07:03.315\nDo you know what I'm talking about?\n\n00:07:03.339 --> 00:07:04.673\nSay, \"Aye.\" Audience: Aye.\n\n00:07:04.697 --> 00:07:05.837\nTR: So, emotion is it.\n\n00:07:05.861 --> 00:07:09.611\nAnd if we get the right emotion,\nwe can get ourselves to do anything.\n\n00:07:09.635 --> 00:07:11.555\nIf you're creative, playful, fun enough,\n\n00:07:11.579 --> 00:07:13.649\ncan you get through to anybody, yes or no?\n\n00:07:13.673 --> 00:07:15.117\nIf you don't have the money,\n\n00:07:15.141 --> 00:07:17.670\nbut you're creative and determined,\nyou find the way.\n\n00:07:17.694 --> 00:07:19.177\nThis is the ultimate resource.\n\n00:07:19.201 --> 00:07:21.434\nBut this is not the story\nthat people tell us.\n\n00:07:21.458 --> 00:07:23.534\nThey tell us a bunch of different stories.\n\n00:07:23.558 --> 00:07:26.267\nThey tell us we don't have\nthe resources, but ultimately,\n\n00:07:26.291 --> 00:07:27.855\nif you take a look here,\n\n00:07:27.879 --> 00:07:31.221\nthey say, what are all the reasons\nthey haven't accomplished that?\n\n00:07:31.245 --> 00:07:33.506\nHe's broken my pattern,\nthat son-of-a-bitch.\n\n00:07:33.530 --> 00:07:36.857\n(Laughter)\n\n00:07:36.881 --> 00:07:39.235\nBut I appreciated the energy,\nI'll tell you that.\n\n00:07:39.259 --> 00:07:40.336\n(Laughter)\n\n00:07:40.360 --> 00:07:41.877\nWhat determines your resources?\n\n00:07:41.901 --> 00:07:45.038\nWe've said decisions shape destiny,\nwhich is my focus here.\n\n00:07:45.062 --> 00:07:48.158\nIf decisions shape destiny,\nwhat determines it is three decisions.\n\n00:07:48.182 --> 00:07:49.335\nWhat will you focus on?\n\n00:07:49.359 --> 00:07:51.810\nYou have to decide\nwhat you're going to focus on.\n\n00:07:51.834 --> 00:07:53.295\nConsciously or unconsciously.\n\n00:07:53.319 --> 00:07:56.230\nthe minute you decide to focus,\nyou must give it a meaning,\n\n00:07:56.254 --> 00:07:58.143\nand that meaning produces emotion.\n\n00:07:58.167 --> 00:07:59.993\nIs this the end or the beginning?\n\n00:08:00.017 --> 00:08:03.916\nIs God punishing me or rewarding me,\nor is this the roll of the dice?\n\n00:08:03.940 --> 00:08:06.934\nAn emotion creates\nwhat we're going to do, or the action.\n\n00:08:06.958 --> 00:08:08.934\nSo, think about your own life,\n\n00:08:08.958 --> 00:08:11.006\nthe decisions that\nhave shaped your destiny.\n\n00:08:11.030 --> 00:08:14.016\nAnd that sounds really heavy,\nbut in the last five or 10 years,\n\n00:08:14.040 --> 00:08:15.587\nhave there been some decisions\n\n00:08:15.611 --> 00:08:19.448\nthat if you'd made a different decision,\nyour life would be completely different?\n\n00:08:19.472 --> 00:08:22.166\nHow many can think about it?\nBetter or worse. Say, \"Aye.\"\n\n00:08:22.190 --> 00:08:23.222\nAudience: Aye.\n\n00:08:23.246 --> 00:08:25.910\nSo the bottom line is,\nmaybe it was where to go to work,\n\n00:08:25.934 --> 00:08:28.787\nand you met the love of your life there,\na career decision.\n\n00:08:28.811 --> 00:08:30.777\nI know the Google geniuses I saw here --\n\n00:08:30.801 --> 00:08:34.189\nI mean, I understand that their decision\nwas to sell their technology.\n\n00:08:34.213 --> 00:08:37.354\nWhat if they made that decision\nversus to build their own culture?\n\n00:08:37.378 --> 00:08:40.307\nHow would the world or their lives\nbe different, their impact?\n\n00:08:40.331 --> 00:08:42.448\nThe history of our world\nis these decisions.\n\n00:08:42.472 --> 00:08:46.034\nWhen a woman stands up and says,\n\"No, I won't go to the back of the bus.\"\n\n00:08:46.058 --> 00:08:49.577\nShe didn't just affect her life.\nThat decision shaped our culture.\n\n00:08:49.601 --> 00:08:52.120\nOr someone standing in front of a tank.\n\n00:08:52.144 --> 00:08:54.934\nOr being in a position\nlike Lance Armstrong,\n\n00:08:54.958 --> 00:08:56.502\n\"You've got testicular cancer.\"\n\n00:08:56.526 --> 00:08:59.565\nThat's pretty tough for any male,\nespecially if you ride a bike.\n\n00:08:59.589 --> 00:09:00.934\n(Laughter)\n\n00:09:00.958 --> 00:09:03.667\nYou've got it in your brain;\nyou've got it in your lungs.\n\n00:09:03.691 --> 00:09:05.883\nBut what was his decision\nof what to focus on?\n\n00:09:05.907 --> 00:09:08.046\nDifferent than most people.\nWhat did it mean?\n\n00:09:08.070 --> 00:09:10.021\nIt wasn't the end; it was the beginning.\n\n00:09:10.045 --> 00:09:12.836\nHe goes off and wins\nseven championships he never once won\n\n00:09:12.860 --> 00:09:16.742\nbefore the cancer, because he got\nemotional fitness, psychological strength.\n\n00:09:16.766 --> 00:09:19.257\nThat's the difference\nin human beings that I've seen\n\n00:09:19.281 --> 00:09:21.140\nof the three million I've been around.\n\n00:09:21.164 --> 00:09:26.949\nIn my lab, I've had three million people\nfrom 80 countries over the last 29 years.\n\n00:09:26.973 --> 00:09:29.437\nAnd after a while,\npatterns become obvious.\n\n00:09:29.461 --> 00:09:33.460\nYou see that South America and Africa\nmay be connected in a certain way, right?\n\n00:09:33.484 --> 00:09:36.102\nOthers say, \"Oh, that sounds\nridiculous.\" It's simple.\n\n00:09:36.126 --> 00:09:38.410\nSo, what shaped Lance? What shapes you?\n\n00:09:38.434 --> 00:09:42.756\nTwo invisible forces.\nVery quickly. One: state.\n\n00:09:42.780 --> 00:09:43.934\nWe all have had times,\n\n00:09:43.958 --> 00:09:46.751\nyou did something, and after,\nyou thought to yourself,\n\n00:09:46.775 --> 00:09:49.934\n\"I can't believe I said or did that,\nthat was so stupid.\"\n\n00:09:49.958 --> 00:09:52.053\nWho's been there? Say, \"Aye.\"\nAudience: Aye.\n\n00:09:52.077 --> 00:09:54.473\nOr after you did something,\nyou go, \"That was me!\"\n\n00:09:54.497 --> 00:09:55.934\n(Laughter)\n\n00:09:55.958 --> 00:09:58.792\nIt wasn't your ability; it was your state.\n\n00:09:58.816 --> 00:10:01.736\nYour model of the world\nis what shapes you long term.\n\n00:10:01.760 --> 00:10:05.292\nYour model of the world is the filter.\nThat's what's shaping us.\n\n00:10:05.316 --> 00:10:06.916\nIt makes people make decisions.\n\n00:10:06.940 --> 00:10:10.196\nTo influence somebody, we need to know\nwhat already influences them.\n\n00:10:10.220 --> 00:10:12.029\nIt's made up of three parts.\n\n00:10:12.053 --> 00:10:14.392\nFirst, what's your target?\nWhat are you after?\n\n00:10:14.416 --> 00:10:15.934\nIt's not your desires.\n\n00:10:15.958 --> 00:10:17.593\nYou can get your desires or goals.\n\n00:10:17.617 --> 00:10:20.831\nWho has ever got a goal or desire\nand thought, is this all there is?\n\n00:10:20.855 --> 00:10:22.108\nSay, \"Aye.\" Audience: Aye.\n\n00:10:22.132 --> 00:10:25.000\nIt's needs we have.

Develop a skill?\nGive up? Smoke a cigarette?\n\n00:10:56.892 --> 00:10:58.934\nAnd if you got totally\ncertain, ironically,\n\n00:10:58.958 --> 00:11:00.244\neven though we need that --\n\n00:11:00.268 --> 00:11:03.461\nyou're not certain about your health,\nor your children, or money.\n\n00:11:03.485 --> 00:11:05.700\nIf you're not sure\nthe ceiling will hold up,\n\n00:11:05.724 --> 00:11:07.343\nyou won't listen to any speaker.\n\n00:11:07.367 --> 00:11:11.116\nWhile we go for certainty differently,\nif we get total certainty, we get what?\n\n00:11:11.140 --> 00:11:12.834\nWhat do you feel if you're certain?\n\n00:11:12.858 --> 00:11:15.511\nYou know what will happen,\nwhen and how it will happen,\n\n00:11:15.535 --> 00:11:16.634\nwhat would you feel?\n\n00:11:16.658 --> 00:11:19.334\nBored out of your minds.\nSo, God, in Her infinite wisdom,\n\n00:11:19.358 --> 00:11:21.934\ngave us a second human need,\nwhich is uncertainty.\n\n00:11:21.958 --> 00:11:24.934\nWe need variety.

00:15:26.363\nSo I went out, got my friends involved,\n\n00:15:26.387 --> 00:15:29.564\nthen I grew companies, got 11,\nand I built the foundation.\n\n00:15:29.588 --> 00:15:30.782\n18 years later,\n\n00:15:30.806 --> 00:15:34.252\nI'm proud to tell you last year we fed\n2 million people in 35 countries\n\n00:15:34.276 --> 00:15:35.460\nthrough our foundation.\n\n00:15:35.484 -->

contribute\n\n00:15:47.690 --> 00:15:50.799\nonce they've had the chance\nto experience it, not talk about it.\n\n00:15:50.823 --> 00:15:52.614\nSo, finally -- I'm about out of time.\n\n00:15:52.638 --> 00:15:55.497\nThe target that shapes you --\n\n00:15:55.521 --> 00:15:57.380\nHere's what's different about people.\n\n00:15:57.404 --> 00:15:58.589\nWe have the same needs.\n\n00:15:58.613 --> 00:16:01.480\nBut are you a certainty freak,\nis that what you value most,\n\n00:16:01.504 --> 00:16:02.681\nor uncertainty?\n\n00:16:02.705 --> 00:16:06.246\nThis man couldn't be a certainty

00:16:12.559\nbut what your lead system is\ntilts you in a different direction.\n\n00:16:12.583 --> 00:16:15.719\nAnd as you move in a direction,\nyou have a destination or destiny.\n\n00:16:15.743 --> 00:16:17.168\nThe second piece is the map.\n\n00:16:17.192 --> 00:16:19.468\nThe operating system\ntells you how to get there,\n\n00:16:19.492 --> 00:16:20.773\nand some people's map is,\n\n00:16:20.797 --> 00:16:23.568\n\"I'm going to save lives\neven if I die for other people,\"\n\n00:16:23.592 --> 00:16:24.768\nand they're a fireman,\n\n00:16:24.792 --> 00:16:27.708\nand somebody else says,\n\"I'm going to kill people to do it.\"\n\n00:16:27.732 --> 00:16:30.310\nThey're trying to meet\nthe same needs of significance.\n\n00:16:30.334 --> 00:16:32.527\nThey want to honor God\nor honor their family.\n\n00:16:32.551 --> 00:16:34.073\nBut they have a different map.\n\n00:16:34.097 --> 00:16:37.976\nAnd there are seven different beliefs;\nI can't go through them, because I'm done.\n\n00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:39.329\nThe last piece is emotion.\n\n00:16:39.353 --> 00:16:41.354\nOne of the parts of the map is like time.\n\n00:16:41.378 --> 00:16:43.667\nSome people's idea\nof a long time is 100 years.\n\n00:16:43.691 --> 00:16:46.366\nSomebody else's is three seconds,\nwhich is what I have.\n\n00:16:46.390 --> 00:16:49.161\nAnd the last one I've already mentioned\nthat fell to you.\n\n00:16:49.185 --> 00:16:50.908\nIf you've got a target and a map --\n\n00:16:50.932 --> 00:16:52.865\nI can't use Google because I love Macs,\n\n00:16:52.889 --> 00:16:54.985\nand they haven't made it\ngood for Macs yet.\n\n00:16:55.009 --> 00:16:56.290\nSo if you use MapQuest --\n\n00:16:56.314 --> 00:16:58.729\nhow many have made\nthis fatal mistake of using it?\n\n00:16:58.753 --> 00:17:00.849\nYou use this thing\nand you don't get there.\n\n00:17:00.873 --> 00:17:04.509\nImagine if your beliefs guarantee\nyou can never get to where you want to go.\n\n00:17:04.533 --> 00:17:05.610\n(Laughter)\n\n00:17:05.634 --> 00:17:06.968\nThe last thing is emotion.\n\n00:17:06.992 --> 00:17:08.996\nHere's what I'll tell you about emotion.\n\n00:17:09.020 --> 00:17:10.495\nThere are 6,000 emotions\n\n00:17:10.519 --> 00:17:12.808\nthat we have words for\nin the English language,\n\n00:17:12.832 --> 00:17:15.988\nwhich is just a linguistic representation\nthat changes by language.\n\n00:17:16.012 --> 00:17:18.312\nBut if your dominant emotions --\n\n00:17:18.336 --> 00:17:21.063\nIf I have 20,000 people or 1,000\n\n00:17:21.087 --> 00:17:24.139\nand I have them write down\nall the emotions that they experience\n\n00:17:24.163 --> 00:17:25.164\nin an average week,\n\n00:17:25.188 --> 00:17:27.118\nand I give them as long as they need,\n\n00:17:27.142 --> 00:17:29.431\nand on one side\nthey write empowering emotions,\n\n00:17:29.455 --> 00:17:30.770\nthe other's disempowering,\n\n00:17:30.794 --> 00:17:33.321\nguess how many emotions\nthey experience? Less than 12.\n\n00:17:33.345 --> 00:17:35.441\nAnd half of those\nmake them feel like shit.\n\n00:17:35.465 --> 00:17:36.890\nThey have six good feelings.\n\n00:17:36.914 --> 00:17:38.554\nHappy, happy, excited, oh shit,\n\n00:17:38.578 --> 00:17:40.821\nfrustrated, frustrated,\noverwhelmed, depressed.\n\n00:17:40.845 --> 00:17:42.318\nHow many of you know somebody\n\n00:17:42.342 --> 00:17:45.113\nwho, no matter what happens,\nfinds a way to get pissed off?\n\n00:17:45.137 --> 00:17:46.317\n(Laughter)\n\n00:17:46.341 --> 00:17:50.682\nOr no matter what happens,\nthey find a way to be happy or excited.\n\n00:17:50.706 --> 00:17:52.710\nHow many of you know somebody like this?\n\n00:17:52.734 --> 00:17:55.680\nWhen 9/11 happened, I'll finish\nwith this, I was in Hawaii.\n\n00:17:55.998 --> 00:17:58.367\nI was with 2,000 people from 45 countries,\n\n00:17:58.391 --> 00:18:00.777\nwe were translating\nfour languages simultaneously\n\n00:18:00.801 --> 00:18:02.921\nfor a program I was conducting,\nfor a week.\n\n00:18:03.233 --> 00:18:05.474\nThe night before was called\nEmotional Mastery.\n\n00:18:05.498 --> 00:18:07.883\nI got up, had no plan\nfor this, and I said --\n\n00:18:07.907 --> 00:18:11.005\nwe had fireworks,\nI do crazy shit, fun stuff,\n\n00:18:11.029 --> 00:18:12.310\nand at the end, I stopped.\n\n00:18:12.334 --> 00:18:15.057\nI had this plan, but I never know\nwhat I'm going to say.\n\n00:18:15.081 --> 00:18:16.506\nAnd all of a sudden, I said,\n\n00:18:16.530 --> 00:18:19.578\n\"When do people really start to live?\nWhen they face death.\"\n\n00:18:19.602 --> 00:18:21.310\nAnd I went through this whole thing\n\n00:18:21.334 --> 00:18:23.816\nabout, if you weren't going\nto get off this island,\n\n00:18:23.840 --> 00:18:26.033\nif nine days from now,\nyou were going to die,\n\n00:18:26.057 --> 00:18:28.876\nwho would you call,\nwhat would you say, what would you do?\n\n00:18:28.900 --> 00:18:30.568\nThat night is when 9/11 happened.\n\n00:18:30.592 --> 00:18:33.458\nOne woman had come to the seminar,\nand when she came there,\n\n00:18:33.482 --> 00:18:36.157\nher previous boyfriend had been\nkidnapped and murdered.\n\n00:18:36.181 --> 00:18:38.856\nHer new boyfriend wanted to marry her,\nand she said no.\n\n00:18:38.880 --> 00:18:42.237\nHe said, \"If you go to that Hawaii thing,\nit's over with us.\"\n\n00:18:42.261 --> 00:18:43.497\nShe said, \"It's over.\"\n\n00:18:43.521 --> 00:18:46.486\nWhen I finished that night,\nshe called him and left a message\n\n00:18:46.510 --> 00:18:49.474\nat the top of the World Trade Center\nwhere he worked, saying,\n\n00:18:49.498 --> 00:18:52.027\n\"I love you, I want you to know\nI want to marry you.\n\n00:18:52.051 --> 00:18:53.455\nIt was stupid of me.\"\n\n00:18:53.479 --> 00:18:56.877\nShe was asleep, because it was 3 a.m.\nfor us, when he called her back,\n\n00:18:56.901 --> 00:18:59.781\nand said, \"Honey, I can't tell you\nwhat this means.\n\n00:18:59.805 --> 00:19:03.154\nI don't know how to tell you this,\nbut you gave me the greatest gift,\n\n00:19:03.178 --> 00:19:04.535\nbecause I'm going to die.\"\n\n00:19:05.122 --> 00:19:07.460\nAnd she played the recording\nfor us in the room.\n\n00:19:07.484 --> 00:19:08.909\nShe was on Larry King later.\n\n00:19:08.933 --> 00:19:10.889\nAnd he said, \"You're probably wondering\n\n00:19:10.913 --> 00:19:13.005\nhow on Earth this could\nhappen to you twice.\n\n00:19:13.029 --> 00:19:15.511\nAll I can say is this must be\nGod's message to you.\n\n00:19:15.535 --> 00:19:18.066\nFrom now on, every day,\ngive your all, love your all.\n\n00:19:18.090 --> 00:19:20.069\nDon't let anything ever stop you.\"\n\n00:19:20.665 --> 00:19:22.908\nShe finishes, and a man\nstands up, and he says,\n\n00:19:22.932 --> 00:19:24.508\n\"I'm from Pakistan, I'm a Muslim.\n\n00:19:24.532 --> 00:19:26.725\nI'd love to hold your hand\nand say I'm sorry,\n\n00:19:26.749 --> 00:19:28.963\nbut frankly, this is retribution.\"\n\n00:19:30.088 --> 00:19:32.571\nI can't tell you the rest,\nbecause I'm out of time.\n\n00:19:32.595 --> 00:19:39.253\n(Laughter)\n\n00:19:39.277 --> 00:19:40.453\nAre you sure?\n\n00:19:40.477 --> 00:19:44.773\n(Laughter)\n\n00:19:44.797 --> 00:19:45.973\n10 seconds!\n\n00:19:45.997 --> 00:19:49.305\n(Laughter and applause)\n\n00:19:49.329 --> 00:19:51.276\n10 seconds, I want to be respectful.\n\n00:19:51.300 --> 00:19:52.436\nAll I can tell you is,\n\n00:19:52.460 --> 00:19:54.067\nI brought this man on stage\n\n00:19:54.091 --> 00:19:57.032\nwith a man from New York who worked\nin the World Trade Center,\n\n00:19:57.056 --> 00:19:59.056\nbecause I had about 200 New Yorkers there.\n\n00:19:59.080 --> 00:20:01.515\nMore than 50 lost\ntheir entire companies, friends,\n\n00:20:01.539 --> 00:20:03.061\nmarking off their Palm Pilots.\n\n00:20:03.085 --> 00:20:05.663\nOne financial trader,\nwoman made of steel, bawling --\n\n00:20:05.687 --> 00:20:07.512\n30 friends crossing off that all died.\n\n00:20:07.536 --> 00:20:10.842\nAnd I said, \"What are we\ngoing to focus on?\n\n00:20:11.530 --> 00:20:13.868\nWhat does this mean\nand what are we going to do?\"\n\n00:20:13.892 --> 00:20:15.964\nAnd I got the group to focus on:\n\n00:20:15.988 --> 00:20:17.704\nif you didn't lose somebody today,\n\n00:20:17.728 --> 00:20:20.306\nyour focus is going to be\nhow to serve somebody else.\n\n00:20:20.330 --> 00:20:23.438\nThen one woman stood up\nand was so angry, screaming and yelling.\n\n00:20:23.462 --> 00:20:26.378\nI found out she wasn't from New York,\nshe's not an American,\n\n00:20:26.402 --> 00:20:27.731\ndoesn't know anybody here.\n\n00:20:27.755 --> 00:20:29.517\nI asked, \"Do you always get angry?\"\n\n00:20:29.541 --> 00:20:30.718\nShe said, \"Yes.\"\n\n00:20:30.742 --> 00:20:32.934\nGuilty people got guilty,\nsad people got sad.\n\n00:20:32.958 --> 00:20:35.633\nI took these two men\nand I did an indirect negotiation.\n\n00:20:35.657 --> 00:20:38.042\nJewish man with family\nin the occupied territory,\n\n00:20:38.066 --> 00:20:41.320\nsomeone in New York who would have died\nif he was at work that day,\n\n00:20:41.344 --> 00:20:43.444\nand this man who wanted to be a terrorist,\n\n00:20:43.468 --> 00:20:44.748\nand I made it very clear.\n\n00:20:44.772 --> 00:20:47.689\nThis integration is on a film,\nwhich I'd be happy to send you,\n\n00:20:47.713 --> 00:20:49.139\ninstead of my verbalization,\n\n00:20:49.163 --> 00:20:51.263\nbut the two of them not only came together\n\n00:20:51.287 --> 00:20:53.721\nand changed their beliefs\nand models of the world,\n\n00:20:53.745 --> 00:20:56.467\nbut worked together to bring,\nfor almost four years now,\n\n00:20:56.491 --> 00:20:58.370\nthrough various mosques and synagogues,\n\n00:20:58.394 --> 00:21:00.012\nthe idea of how to create peace.\n\n00:21:00.036 --> 00:21:02.699\nAnd he wrote a book, called\n\"My Jihad, My Way of Peace.\"\n\n00:21:02.723 --> 00:21:04.246\nSo, transformation can happen.\n\n00:21:04.270 --> 00:21:05.494\nMy invitation to you is:\n\n00:21:05.518 --> 00:21:07.049\nexplore your web,\n\n00:21:07.073 --> 00:21:08.623\nthe web in here --\n\n00:21:08.647 --> 00:21:12.235\nthe needs, the beliefs, the emotions\nthat are controlling you,\n\n00:21:12.259 --> 00:21:13.436\nfor two reasons:\n\n00:21:13.460 --> 00:21:15.757\nso there's more of you to give,\nand achieve, too,\n\n00:21:15.781 --> 00:21:17.069\nbut I mean give,\n\n00:21:17.093 --> 00:21:19.146\nbecause that's what's\ngoing to fill you up.\n\n00:21:19.170 --> 00:21:20.998\nAnd secondly, so you can appreciate --\n\n00:21:21.022 --> 00:21:23.841\nnot just understand,\nthat's intellectual, that's the mind,\n\n00:21:23.865 --> 00:21:25.963\nbut appreciate\nwhat's driving other people.\n\n00:21:25.987 --> 00:21:28.228\nIt's the only way\nour world's going to change.\n\n00:21:28.252 --> 00:21:30.830\nGod bless you, thank you.\nI hope this was of service.\n\n00:21:30.854 -->

seventh birthday, I came downstairs to the kitchen, where my mother was washing the dishes and my father was reading the paper or something, and I sort of presented myself to them in the doorway, and they said, \"Hey, happy birthday!\" And I said, \"I'm seven.\" And my father smiled and said, \"Well, you know what that means, don't you?\" And I said, \"Yeah, that I'm going to have a party and a cake and get a lot of presents?\" And my dad said, \"Well, yes. But more importantly, being seven means that you've reached the age of reason, and you're now capable of committing any and all sins against God and man.\"(Laughter)Now, I had heard this phrase, \"age of reason,\" before. Sister Mary Kevin had been bandying it about my second-grade class at school. But when she said it, the phrase seemed all caught up in the excitement of preparations for our first communion and our first confession, and everybody knew that was really all about the white dress and the white veil. And anyway, I hadn't really paid all that much attention to that phrase, \"age of reason.\" So, I said, \"Yeah, yeah, age of reason. What does that mean again?\" And my dad said, \"Well, we believe, in the Catholic Church, that God knows that little kids don't know the difference between right and wrong, but when you're seven, you're old enough to know better. So, you've grown up and reached the age of reason, and now God will start keeping notes on you, and begin your permanent record.\"(Laughter)And I said, \"Oh ... Wait a minute. You mean all that time, up till today, all that time I was so good, God didn't notice it?\" And my mom said, \"Well, I noticed it.\"(Laughter)And I thought, \"How could I not have known this before? How could it not have sunk in when they'd been telling me? All that being good and no real credit for it. And worst of all, how could I not have realized this very important information until the very day that it was basically useless to me?\" So I said, \"Well, Mom and Dad, what about Santa Claus? I mean, Santa Claus knows if you're naughty or nice, right?\" And my dad said, \"Yeah, but, honey, I think that's technically just between Thanksgiving and Christmas.\" And my mother said, \"Oh, Bob, stop it. Let's just tell her. I mean, she's seven. Julie, there is no Santa Claus.\"(Laughter)Now, this was actually not that upsetting to me. My parents had this whole elaborate story about Santa Claus: how they had talked to Santa Claus himself and agreed that instead of Santa delivering our presents over the night of Christmas Eve, like he did for every other family who got to open their surprises first thing Christmas morning, our family would give Santa more time. Santa would come to our house while we were at nine o'clock high mass on Christmas morning, but only if all of us kids did not make a fuss. Which made me very suspicious. It was pretty obvious that it was really our parents giving us the presents. I mean, my dad had a very distinctive wrapping style, and my mother's handwriting was so close to Santa's.(Laughter)Plus, why would Santa save time by having to loop back to our house after he'd gone to everybody else's? There was only one obvious conclusion to reach from this mountain of evidence: our family was too strange and weird for even Santa Claus to come visit, and my poor parents were trying to protect us from the embarrassment, this humiliation of rejection by Santa, who was jolly \u2014 but let's face it, he was also very judgmental. So to find out that there was no Santa Claus at all was actually sort of a relief.I left the kitchen not really in shock about Santa, but rather, I was just dumbfounded about how I could have missed this whole age of reason thing. It was too late for me, but maybe I could help someone else, someone who could use the information. They had to fit two criteria: they had to be old enough to be able to understand the whole concept of the age of reason, and not yet seven. The answer was clear: my brother Bill. He was six. Well, I finally found Bill about a block away from our house at this public school playground. It was a Saturday, and he was all by himself, just kicking a ball against the side of a wall. I ran up to him and said, \"Bill! I just realized that the age of reason starts when you turn seven, and then you're capable of committing any and all sins against God and man.\" And Bill said, \"So?\" And I said, \"So, you're six. You have a whole year to do anything you want to and God won't notice it.\" And he said, \"So?\" And I said, \"So? So everything!\" And I turned to run. I was so angry with him. But when I got to the top of the steps, I turned around dramatically and said, \"Oh, by the way, Bill \u2014 there is no Santa Claus.\"(Laughter)Now, I didn't know it at the time, but I really wasn't turning seven on September 10th. For my 13th birthday, I planned a slumber party with all of my girlfriends, but a couple of weeks beforehand my mother took me aside and said, \"I need to speak to you privately. September 10th is not your birthday. It's October 10th.\" And I said, \"What?\"(Laughter)And she said ...(Laughter)\"Listen. The cut-off date to start kindergarten was September 15th.\"(Laughter)\"So I told them that your birthday was September 10th, and then I wasn't sure that you weren't just going to go blab it all over the place, so I started to tell you your birthday was September 10th. But, Julie, you were so ready to start school, honey. You were so ready.\" I thought about it, and when I was four, I was already the oldest of four children, and my mother even had another child to come, so what I think she \u2014 understandably \u2014 really meant was that she was so ready, she was so ready. Then she said, \"Don't worry, Julie. Every year on October 10th, when it was your birthday but you didn't realize it, I made sure that you ate a piece of cake that day.\"(Laughter)Which was comforting, but troubling. My mother had been celebrating my birthday with me, without me.(Laughter)What was so upsetting about this new piece of information was not that I had to change the date of my slumber party with all of my girlfriends. What was most upsetting was that this meant I was not a Virgo. I had a huge Virgo poster in my bedroom. And I read my horoscope every single day, and it was so totally me.(Laughter)And this meant that I was a Libra? So, I took the bus downtown to get the new Libra poster. The Virgo poster is a picture of a beautiful woman with long hair, sort of lounging by some water, but the Libra poster is just a huge scale. This was around the time that I started filling out physically, and I was filling out a lot more than a lot of the other girls, and frankly, the whole idea that my astrological sign was a scale just seemed ominous and depressing.(Laughter)But I got the new Libra poster, and I started to read my new Libra horoscope, and I was astonished to find that it was also totally me.(Laughter)It wasn't until years later, looking back on this whole age-of-reason, change-of-birthday thing, that it dawned on me: I wasn't turning seven when I thought I turned seven. I had a whole other month to do anything I wanted to before God started keeping tabs on me. Oh, life can be so cruel. One day, two Mormon missionaries came to my door. Now, I just live off a main thoroughfare in Los Angeles, and my block is \u2014 well, it's a natural beginning for people who are peddling things door to door. Sometimes I get little old ladies from the Seventh Day Adventist Church showing me these cartoon pictures of heaven. And sometimes I get teenagers who promise me that they won't join a gang and just start robbing people, if I only buy some magazine subscriptions from them. So normally, I just ignore the doorbell, but on this day, I answered. And there stood two boys, each about 19, in white, starched short-sleeved shirts, and they had little name tags that identified them as official representatives of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, and they said they had a message for me, from God. I said, \"A message for me? From God?\" And they said, \"Yes.\" Now, I was raised in the Pacific Northwest, around a lot of Church of Latter-day Saints people and, you know, I've worked with them and even dated them, but I never really knew the doctrine, or what they said to people when they were out on a mission, and I guess I was sort of curious, so I said, \"Well, please, come in.\" And they looked really happy, because I don't think this happens to them all that often.(Laughter)And I sat them down, and I got them glasses of water \u2014 Ok, I got it, I got it. I got them glasses of water. Don't touch my hair, that's the thing.(Laughter)You can't put a video of myself in front of me and expect me not to fix my hair. Ok.(Laughter)So I sat them down and I got them glasses of water, and after niceties, they said, \"Do you believe that God loves you with all his heart?\" And I thought, \"Well, of course I believe in God, but you know, I don't like that word 'heart,' because it anthropomorphizes God, and I don't like the word, 'his,' either, because that sexualizes God.\" But I didn't want to argue semantics with these boys, so after a very long, uncomfortable pause, I said, \"Yes, yes, I do. I feel very loved.\" And they looked at each other and smiled, like that was the right answer. And then they said, \"Do you believe that we're all brothers and sisters on this planet?\" And I said, \"Yes, I do.\" And I was so relieved that it was a question I could answer so quickly. And they said, \"Well, then we have a story to tell you.\"And they told me this story all about this guy named Lehi, who lived in Jerusalem in 600 BC. Now, apparently in Jerusalem in 600 BC, everyone was completely bad and evil. Every single one of them: man, woman, child, infant, fetus. And God came to Lehi and said to him, \"Put your family on a boat and I will lead you out of here.\" And God did lead them. He led them to America. I said, \"America?(Laughter)From Jerusalem to America by boat in 600 BC?\" And they said, \"Yes.\"(Laughter)Then they told me how Lehi and his descendants reproduced and reproduced, and over the course of 600 years, there were two great races of them, the Nephites and the Lamanites, and the Nephites were totally good \u2014 each and every one of them \u2014 and the Lamanites were totally bad and evil \u2014 every single one of them just bad to the bone.Then, after Jesus died on the cross for our sins, on his way up to heaven, he stopped by America and visited the Nephites.(Laughter)And he told them that if they all remained totally, totally good \u2014 each and every one of them \u2014 they would win the war against the evil Lamanites. But apparently somebody blew it, because the Lamanites were able to kill all the Nephites. All but one guy, this guy named Mormon, who managed to survive by hiding in the woods. And he made sure this whole story was written down in reformed Egyptian hieroglyphics chiseled onto gold plates, which he then buried near Palmyra, New York.(Laughter)Well, I was just on the edge of my seat.(Laughter)I said, \"What happened to the Lamanites?\" And they said, \"Well, they became our Native Americans, here in the U.S.\" And I said, \"So, you believe the Native Americans are descended from a people who were totally evil?\" And they said, \"Yes.\" Then they told me how this guy named Joseph Smith found those buried gold plates right in his backyard, and he also found this magic stone back there that he put into his hat and then buried his face into, and this allowed him to translate the gold plates from the reformed Egyptian into English.Well, at this point I just wanted to give these two boys some advice about their pitch.(Laughter)I wanted to say \u2014(Applause)\"Ok, don't start with this story.\"(Laughter)I mean, even the Scientologists know to start with a personality test before they start \u2014(Applause)telling people all about Xenu, the evil intergalactic overlord. Then, they said, \"Do you believe that God speaks to us through his righteous prophets?\" And I said, \"No, I don't,\" because I was sort of upset about this Lamanite story and this crazy gold plate story, but the truth was, I hadn't really thought this through, so I backpedaled a little and I said, \"Well, what exactly do you mean by 'righteous'? And what do you mean by prophets? Like, could the prophets be women?\" And they said, \"No.\" And I said, \"Why?\" And they said, \"Well, it's because God gave women a gift that is so spectacular, it is so wonderful, that the only gift he had left over to give men was the gift of prophecy.\" What is this wonderful gift God gave women, I wondered? Maybe their greater ability to cooperate and adapt?(Laughter)Women's longer lifespan? The fact that women tend to be much less violent than men? But no \u2014 it wasn't any of these gifts. They said, \"Well, it's her ability to bear children.\" I said, \"Oh, come on. I mean, even if women tried to have a baby every single year from the time they were 15 to the time they were 45, assuming they didn't die from exhaustion, it still seems like some women would have some time left over to hear the word of God.\" And they said, \"No.\"(Laughter)Well, then they didn't look so fresh-faced and cute to me any more, but they had more to say. They said, \"Well, we also believe that if you're a Mormon, and if you're in good standing with the church, when you die, you get to go to heaven and be with your family for all eternity.\" And I said, \"Oh, dear.(Laughter)That wouldn't be such a good incentive for me.\"(Laughter)And they said, \"Oh.(Laughter)Hey! Well, we also believe that when you go to heaven, you get your body restored to you in its best original state. Like, if you'd lost a leg, well, you get it back. Or, if you'd gone blind, you could see.\" I said, \"Oh. Now, I don't have a uterus, because I had cancer a few years ago. So does this mean that if I went to heaven, I would get my old uterus back?\" And they said, \"Sure.\" And I said, \"I don't want it back. I'm happy without it.\" Gosh. What if you had a nose job and you liked it?(Laughter)Would God force you to get your old nose back? Then they gave me this Book of Mormon, told me to read this chapter and that chapter, and said they'd come back and check in on me, and I think I said something like, \"Please don't hurry,\" or maybe just, \"Please don't,\" and they were gone.Ok, so I initially felt really superior to these boys, and smug in my more conventional faith. But then the more I thought about it, the more I had to be honest with myself. If someone came to my door and I was hearing Catholic theology and dogma for the very first time, and they said, \"We believe that God impregnated a very young girl without the use of intercourse, and the fact that she was a virgin is maniacally important to us.\"(Laughter)\"And she had a baby, and that's the son of God,\" I mean, I would think that's equally ridiculous. I'm just so used to that story.(Laughter)So, I couldn't let myself feel condescending towards these boys. But the question they asked me when they first arrived really stuck in my head: Did I believe that God loved me with all his heart? Because I wasn't exactly sure how I felt about that question. Now, if they had asked me, \"Do you feel that God loves you with all his heart?\" Well, that would have been much different, I think I would have instantly answered, \"Yes, yes, I feel it all the time. I feel God's love when I'm hurt and confused, and I feel consoled and cared for. I take shelter in God's love when I don't understand why tragedy hits, and I feel God's love when I look with gratitude at all the beauty I see.\" But since they asked me that question with the word \"believe\" in it, somehow it was all different, because I wasn't exactly sure if I believed what I so clearly felt.", "id": 86, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:12.561 --> 00:00:15.862\nOn September 10, the morning\nof my seventh birthday,\n\n00:00:15.886 --> 00:00:19.277\nI came downstairs to the kitchen,\nwhere my mother was washing the dishes\n\n00:00:19.301 --> 00:00:21.934\nand my father was reading\nthe paper or something,\n\n00:00:21.958 --> 00:00:25.244\nand I sort of presented myself to them\nin the doorway, and they said,\n\n00:00:25.268 --> 00:00:29.934\n\"Hey, happy birthday!\"\nAnd I said, \"I'm seven.\"\n\n00:00:29.958 --> 00:00:31.934\nAnd my father smiled and said,\n\n00:00:31.958 --> 00:00:34.344\n\"Well, you know\nwhat that means, don't you?\"\n\n00:00:34.368 --> 00:00:37.194\nAnd I said, \"Yeah,\nthat I'm going to have a party\n\n00:00:37.218 --> 00:00:39.441\nand a cake and get a lot of presents?\"\n\n00:00:39.465 --> 00:00:41.676\nAnd my dad said, \"Well, yes.\n\n00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:42.860\nBut more importantly,\n\n00:00:42.884 --> 00:00:45.829\nbeing seven means that\nyou've reached the age of reason,\n\n00:00:45.853 --> 00:00:50.380\nand you're now capable of committing\nany and all sins against God and man.\"\n\n00:00:50.404 --> 00:00:53.256\n(Laughter)\n\n00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:56.506\nNow, I had heard this phrase,\n\"age of reason,\" before.\n\n00:00:56.530 --> 00:00:58.781\nSister Mary Kevin\nhad been bandying it about\n\n00:00:58.805 --> 00:01:00.502\nmy second-grade class at school.\n\n00:01:00.526 --> 00:01:01.678\nBut when she said it,\n\n00:01:01.702 --> 00:01:04.763\nthe phrase seemed all caught up\nin the excitement of preparations\n\n00:01:04.787 --> 00:01:07.094\nfor our first communion\nand our first confession,\n\n00:01:07.118 --> 00:01:09.944\nand everybody knew that was really\nall about the white dress\n\n00:01:09.968 --> 00:01:11.119\nand the white veil.\n\n00:01:11.143 --> 00:01:13.783\nAnd anyway, I hadn't really paid\nall that much attention\n\n00:01:13.807 --> 00:01:15.646\nto that phrase, \"age of reason.\"\n\n00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:19.858\nSo, I said, \"Yeah, yeah, age of reason.\nWhat does that mean again?\"\n\n00:01:19.882 --> 00:01:23.512\nAnd my dad said, \"Well, we believe,\nin the Catholic Church,\n\n00:01:23.536 --> 00:01:27.413\nthat God knows that little kids don't know\nthe difference between right and wrong,\n\n00:01:27.437 --> 00:01:30.075\nbut when you're seven,\nyou're old enough to know better.\n\n00:01:30.099 --> 00:01:32.714\nSo, you've grown up\nand reached the age of reason,\n\n00:01:32.738 --> 00:01:35.355\nand now God will start\nkeeping notes on you,\n\n00:01:35.379 --> 00:01:37.335\nand begin your permanent record.\"\n\n00:01:37.359 --> 00:01:38.369\n(Laughter)\n\n00:01:38.393 --> 00:01:41.074\nAnd I said, \"Oh ...\n\n00:01:42.725 --> 00:01:43.940\nWait a minute.\n\n00:01:43.964 --> 00:01:47.138\nYou mean all that time, up till today,\n\n00:01:47.162 --> 00:01:51.310\nall that time I was so good,\nGod didn't notice it?\"\n\n00:01:51.334 --> 00:01:53.934\nAnd my mom said, \"Well, I noticed it.\"\n\n00:01:53.958 --> 00:01:55.934\n(Laughter)\n\n00:01:55.958 --> 00:01:58.543\nAnd I thought, \"How could\nI not have known this before?\n\n00:01:58.567 --> 00:02:01.297\nHow could it not have sunk in\nwhen they'd been telling me?\n\n00:02:01.321 --> 00:02:03.489\nAll that being good\nand no real credit for it.\n\n00:02:03.513 --> 00:02:05.722\nAnd worst of all,\nhow could I not have realized\n\n00:02:05.746 --> 00:02:07.230\nthis very important information\n\n00:02:07.254 --> 00:02:10.176\nuntil the very day\nthat it was basically useless to me?\"\n\n00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:13.566\nSo I said, \"Well, Mom and Dad,\nwhat about Santa Claus?\n\n00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:16.934\nI mean, Santa Claus knows\nif you're naughty or nice, right?\"\n\n00:02:16.958 --> 00:02:18.934\nAnd my dad said, \"Yeah, but, honey,\n\n00:02:18.958 --> 00:02:22.223\nI think that's technically just\nbetween Thanksgiving and Christmas.\"\n\n00:02:22.247 --> 00:02:26.659\nAnd my mother said, \"Oh, Bob, stop it.\nLet's just tell her.

He was six.\n\n00:04:06.235 --> 00:04:07.497\nWell, I finally found Bill\n\n00:04:07.521 --> 00:04:10.730\nabout a block away from our house\nat this public school playground.\n\n00:04:10.754 --> 00:04:12.870\nIt was a Saturday,\nand he was all by himself,\n\n00:04:12.894 --> 00:04:15.100\njust kicking a ball\nagainst the side of a wall.\n\n00:04:15.124 --> 00:04:16.934\nI ran up to him and said, \"Bill!\n\n00:04:16.958 --> 00:04:20.101\nI just realized that the age of reason\nstarts when you turn seven,\n\n00:04:20.125 --> 00:04:22.671\nand then you're capable\nof committing any and all sins\n\n00:04:22.695 --> 00:04:23.846\nagainst God and man.\"\n\n00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:25.497\nAnd Bill said, \"So?\"\n\n00:04:25.882 --> 00:04:27.868\nAnd I said, \"So, you're six.\n\n00:04:27.892 --> 00:04:31.930\nYou have a whole year to do anything\nyou want to and God won't notice it.\"\n\n00:04:31.954 --> 00:04:33.696\nAnd he said, \"So?\"\n\n00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:37.291\nAnd I said, \"So?

his descendants\n\n00:10:33.125 --> 00:10:36.000\nreproduced and reproduced,\nand over the course of 600 years,\n\n00:10:36.024 --> 00:10:39.278\nthere were two great races of them,\nthe Nephites and the Lamanites,\n\n00:10:39.302 --> 00:10:42.752\nand the Nephites were totally good --\neach and every one of them --\n\n00:10:42.776 --> 00:10:44.943\nand the Lamanites\nwere totally bad and evil --\n\n00:10:44.967 --> 00:10:47.118\nevery single one of them\njust bad to the bone.\n\n00:10:47.142 --> 00:10:50.650\nThen, after Jesus died\non the cross for our sins,\n\n00:10:50.674 --> 00:10:51.841\non his way up to heaven,\n\n00:10:51.865 --> 00:10:54.438\nhe stopped by America\nand visited the Nephites.\n\n00:10:54.462 --> 00:10:55.488\n(Laughter)\n\n00:10:55.512 --> 00:10:59.000\nAnd he told them that if they all remained\ntotally, totally good --\n\n00:10:59.024 --> 00:11:00.406\neach and every one of them --\n\n00:11:00.430 --> 00:11:03.131\nthey would win the war\nagainst the evil Lamanites.\n\n00:11:03.155 --> 00:11:05.656\nBut apparently somebody blew it,\n\n00:11:05.680 --> 00:11:08.417\nbecause the Lamanites\nwere able to kill all the Nephites.\n\n00:11:08.441 --> 00:11:10.707\nAll but one guy, this guy named Mormon,\n\n00:11:10.731 --> 00:11:13.477\nwho managed to survive\nby hiding in the woods.\n\n00:11:13.501 --> 00:11:16.211\nAnd he made sure\nthis whole story was written down\n\n00:11:16.235 --> 00:11:20.603\nin reformed Egyptian hieroglyphics\nchiseled onto gold plates,\n\n00:11:20.627 --> 00:11:23.408\nwhich he then buried\nnear Palmyra, New York.\n\n00:11:23.718 --> 00:11:29.193\n(Laughter)\n\n00:11:29.217 --> 00:11:31.934\nWell, I was just on the edge of my seat.\n\n00:11:31.958 --> 00:11:35.300\n(Laughter)\n\n00:11:35.324 --> 00:11:38.176\nI said, \"What happened to the Lamanites?\"\n\n00:11:38.200 --> 00:11:42.042\nAnd they said, \"Well, they became\nour Native Americans, here in the U.S.\"\n\n00:11:42.066 --> 00:11:45.252\nAnd I said, \"So, you believe\nthe Native Americans are descended\n\n00:11:45.276 --> 00:11:47.317\nfrom a people who were totally evil?\"\n\n00:11:47.341 --> 00:11:49.198\nAnd they said, \"Yes.\"\n\n00:11:49.585 --> 00:11:52.641\nThen they told me\nhow this guy named Joseph Smith\n\n00:11:52.665 --> 00:11:56.300\nfound those buried gold plates\nright in his backyard,\n\n00:11:56.324 --> 00:12:00.046\nand he also found this magic stone\nback there that he put into his hat\n\n00:12:00.070 --> 00:12:01.568\nand then buried his face into,\n\n00:12:01.592 --> 00:12:03.952\nand this allowed him\nto translate the gold plates\n\n00:12:03.976 --> 00:12:06.411\nfrom the reformed Egyptian into English.\n\n00:12:06.848 --> 00:12:10.223\nWell, at this point I just wanted to give\nthese two boys some advice\n\n00:12:10.247 --> 00:12:11.676\nabout their pitch.\n\n00:12:11.700 --> 00:12:14.541\n(Laughter)\n\n00:12:14.565

00:12:20.934\n(Laughter)\n\n00:12:20.958 --> 00:12:23.001\nI mean, even the Scientologists\n\n00:12:23.025 --> 00:12:26.310\nknow to start with a personality test\nbefore they start --\n\n00:12:26.334 --> 00:12:27.934\n(Applause)\n\n00:12:27.958 --> 00:12:32.412\ntelling people all about Xenu,\nthe evil intergalactic overlord.\n\n00:12:33.096 --> 00:12:35.683\nThen, they said, \"Do you believe\nthat God speaks to us\n\n00:12:35.707 --> 00:12:37.247\nthrough his righteous prophets?\"\n\n00:12:37.271 --> 00:12:38.524\nAnd I said, \"No, I don't,\"\n\n00:12:38.548 -->

00:13:01.397\nAnd they said, \"Well, it's because\nGod gave women a gift\n\n00:13:01.421 --> 00:13:03.392\nthat is so spectacular,\n\n00:13:03.416 --> 00:13:08.193\nit is so wonderful, that the only gift\nhe had left over to give men\n\n00:13:08.217 --> 00:13:09.836\nwas the gift of prophecy.\"\n\n00:13:10.614 --> 00:13:13.937\nWhat is this wonderful gift\nGod gave women, I wondered?\n\n00:13:13.961 --> 00:13:17.300\nMaybe their greater ability\nto cooperate and adapt?\n\n00:13:17.324 --> 00:13:18.336\n(Laughter)\n\n00:13:18.360 --> 00:13:19.737\nWomen's longer lifespan?\n\n00:13:19.761 --> 00:13:22.965\nThe fact that women tend to be\nmuch less violent than men?\n\n00:13:22.989 --> 00:13:25.247\nBut no -- it wasn't any of these gifts.\n\n00:13:25.271 --> 00:13:28.335\nThey said, \"Well, it's her ability\nto bear children.\"\n\n00:13:28.359 --> 00:13:29.787\nI said, \"Oh, come on.\n\n00:13:29.811 --> 00:13:32.630\nI mean, even if women\ntried to have a baby every single year\n\n00:13:32.654 --> 00:13:35.591\nfrom the time they were 15\nto the time they were 45,\n\n00:13:35.615 --> 00:13:37.611\nassuming they didn't die from exhaustion,\n\n00:13:37.635 --> 00:13:40.523\nit still seems like some women\nwould have some time left over\n\n00:13:40.547 --> 00:13:41.993\nto hear the word of God.\"\n\n00:13:42.017 --> 00:13:43.934\nAnd they said, \"No.\"\n\n00:13:43.958 --> 00:13:46.934\n(Laughter)\n\n00:13:46.958 --> 00:13:50.122\nWell, then they didn't look so\nfresh-faced and cute to me any more,\n\n00:13:50.146 --> 00:13:51.351\nbut they had more to say.\n\n00:13:51.375 --> 00:13:54.109\nThey said, \"Well, we also believe\nthat if you're a Mormon,\n\n00:13:54.133 --> 00:13:56.347\nand if you're in good standing\nwith the church,\n\n00:13:56.371 --> 00:13:58.507\nwhen you die, you get to go to heaven\n\n00:13:58.531 --> 00:14:01.312\nand be with your family for all eternity.\"\n\n00:14:01.336 --> 00:14:03.394\nAnd I said, \"Oh, dear.\n\n00:14:03.418 --> 00:14:10.322\n(Laughter)\n\n00:14:10.346 --> 00:14:12.545\nThat wouldn't be\nsuch a good incentive for me.\"\n\n00:14:12.569 --> 00:14:13.869\n(Laughter)\n\n00:14:13.893 --> 00:14:15.378\nAnd they said, \"Oh.\n\n00:14:15.402 --> 00:14:16.761\n(Laughter)\n\n00:14:16.785 --> 00:14:19.830\nHey! Well, we also believe\nthat when you go to heaven,\n\n00:14:19.854 --> 00:14:22.741\nyou get your body restored to you\nin its best original state.\n\n00:14:22.765 --> 00:14:25.195\nLike, if you'd lost a leg,\nwell, you get it back.\n\n00:14:25.219 --> 00:14:27.195\nOr, if you'd gone blind, you could see.\"\n\n00:14:27.219 --> 00:14:30.188\nI said, \"Oh. Now, I don't have a uterus,\n\n00:14:30.212 --> 00:14:32.303\nbecause I had cancer a few years ago.\n\n00:14:32.327 --> 00:14:34.373\nSo does this mean\nthat if I went to heaven,\n\n00:14:34.397 --> 00:14:36.429\nI would get my old uterus back?\"\n\n00:14:36.453 --> 00:14:38.509\nAnd they said, \"Sure.\"\n\n00:14:38.533 --> 00:14:44.298\nAnd I said, \"I don't want it back.\nI'm happy without it.\" Gosh.\n\n00:14:44.322 --> 00:14:47.289\nWhat if you had a nose job\nand you liked it?\n\n00:14:47.313 --> 00:14:49.019\n(Laughter)\n\n00:14:49.043 --> 00:14:51.934\nWould God force you\nto get your old nose back?\n\n00:14:52.782 --> 00:14:54.703\nThen they gave me this Book of Mormon,\n\n00:14:54.727 --> 00:14:56.880\ntold me to read\nthis chapter and that chapter,\n\n00:14:56.904 --> 00:14:59.182\nand said they'd come back\nand check in on me,\n\n00:14:59.206 --> 00:15:01.871\nand I think I said something\nlike, \"Please don't hurry,\"\n\n00:15:01.895 --> 00:15:04.273\nor maybe just, \"Please don't,\"\nand they were gone.\n\n00:15:04.297 --> 00:15:06.885\nOk, so I initially felt\nreally superior to these boys,\n\n00:15:06.909 --> 00:15:09.892\nand smug in my more conventional faith.\n\n00:15:10.375 --> 00:15:14.054\nBut then the more I thought about it,\nthe more I had to be honest with myself.\n\n00:15:14.078 --> 00:15:15.381\nIf someone came to my door\n\n00:15:15.405 --> 00:15:18.750\nand I was hearing Catholic theology\nand dogma for the very first time,\n\n00:15:18.774 --> 00:15:22.348\nand they said, \"We believe that God\nimpregnated a very young girl\n\n00:15:22.372 --> 00:15:23.934\nwithout the use of intercourse,\n\n00:15:23.958 --> 00:15:27.149\nand the fact that she was a virgin\nis maniacally important to us.\"\n\n00:15:27.173 --> 00:15:28.475\n(Laughter)\n\n00:15:28.499 --> 00:15:31.646\n\"And she had a baby,\nand that's the son of God,\"\n\n00:15:31.670 --> 00:15:33.934\nI mean, I would think\nthat's equally ridiculous.\n\n00:15:33.958 --> 00:15:35.820\nI'm just so used to that story.\n\n00:15:35.844 --> 00:15:36.934\n(Laughter)\n\n00:15:36.958 --> 00:15:40.414\nSo, I couldn't let myself feel\ncondescending towards these boys.\n\n00:15:40.438 --> 00:15:42.998\nBut the question they asked me\nwhen they first arrived\n\n00:15:43.022 --> 00:15:44.482\nreally stuck in my head:\n\n00:15:44.506 --> 00:15:47.381\nDid I believe that God\nloved me with all his heart?\n\n00:15:47.958 --> 00:15:51.112\nBecause I wasn't exactly sure\nhow I felt about that question.\n\n00:15:51.500 --> 00:15:52.775\nNow, if they had asked me,\n\n00:15:52.799 --> 00:15:56.025\n\"Do you feel that God loves\nyou with all his heart?\"\n\n00:15:56.049 --> 00:16:00.055\nWell, that would have been much different,\nI think I would have instantly answered,\n\n00:16:00.079 --> 00:16:01.704\n\"Yes, yes, I feel it all the time.\n\n00:16:01.728 --> 00:16:04.473\nI feel God's love\nwhen I'm hurt and confused,\n\n00:16:04.497 --> 00:16:07.125\nand I feel consoled and cared for.\n\n00:16:07.149 --> 00:16:11.217\nI take shelter in God's love when\nI don't understand why tragedy hits,\n\n00:16:11.241 --> 00:16:14.934\nand I feel God's love when I look\nwith gratitude at all the beauty I see.\"\n\n00:16:15.506 --> 00:16:18.708\nBut since they asked me that question\nwith the word \"believe\" in it,\n\n00:16:18.732 --> 00:16:20.190\nsomehow it was all different,\n\n00:16:20.214 --> 00:16:25.958\nbecause I wasn't exactly sure\nif I believed what I so clearly felt."}, {"title": "Behind the design of Seattle's library", "duration": "1198", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/joshua_prince_ramus_on_seattle_s_library", "transcript": "I'm going to present three projects in rapid fire. I don't have much time to do it. And I want to reinforce three ideas with that rapid-fire presentation.The first is what I like to call a hyper-rational process. It's a process that takes rationality almost to an absurd level, and it transcends all the baggage that normally comes with what people would call, sort of a rational conclusion to something. And it concludes in something that you see here, that you actually wouldn't expect as being the result of rationality.The second \u2014 the second is that this process does not have a signature. There is no authorship. Architects are obsessed with authorship. This is something that has editing and it has teams, but in fact, we no longer see within this process, the traditional master architect creating a sketch that his minions carry out.And the third is that it challenges \u2014 and this is, in the length of this, very hard to support why, connect all these things \u2014 but it challenges the high modernist notion of flexibility. High modernists said we will create sort of singular spaces that are generic, almost anything can happen within them. I call it sort of \"shotgun flexibility\" \u2014 turn your head this way; shoot; and you're bound to kill something. So, this is the promise of high modernism: within a single space, actually, any kind of activity can happen. But as we're seeing, operational costs are starting to dwarf capital costs in terms of design parameters. And so, with this sort of idea, what happens is, whatever actually is in the building on opening day, or whatever seems to be the most immediate need, starts to dwarf the possibility and sort of subsume it, of anything else could ever happen. And so we're proposing a different kind of flexibility, something that we call \"compartmentalized flexibility.\" And the idea is that you, within that continuum, identify a series of points, and you design specifically to them. They can be pushed off-center a little bit, but in the end you actually still get as much of that original spectrum as you originally had hoped. With high modernist flexibility, that doesn't really work.Now I'm going to talk about \u2014 I'm going to build up the Seattle Central Library in this way before your eyes in about five or six diagrams, and I truly mean this is the design process that you'll see. With the library staff and the library board, we settled on two core positions. This is the first one, and this is showing, over the last 900 years, the evolution of the book, and other technologies. This diagram was our sort of position piece about the book, and our position was, books are technology \u2014 that's something people forget \u2014 but it's a form of technology that will have to share its dominance with any other form of truly potent technology or media.The second premise \u2014 and this was something that was very difficult for us to convince the librarians of at first \u2014 is that libraries, since the inception of Carnegie Library tradition in America, had a second responsibility, and that was for social roles. Ok, now, this I'll come back to later, but something \u2014 actually, the librarians at first said, \"No, this isn't our mandate. Our mandate is media, and particularly the book.\"So what you're seeing now is actually the design of the building. The upper diagram is what we had seen in a whole host of contemporary libraries that used high modernist flexibility. Sort of, any activity could happen anywhere. We don't know the future of the library; we don't know the future of the book; and so, we'll use this approach.And what we saw were buildings that were very generic, and worse \u2014 not only were they very generic \u2014 so, not only does the reading room look like the copy room look like the magazine area \u2014 but it meant that whatever issue was troubling the library at that moment was starting to engulf every other activity that was happening in it. And in this case, what was getting engulfed were these social responsibilities by the expansion of the book. And so we proposed what's at the lower diagram. Very dumb approach: simply compartmentalize. Put those things whose evolution we could predict \u2014 and I don't mean that we could say what would actually happen in the future, but we have some certainty of the spectrum of what would happen in the future \u2014 put those in boxes designed specifically for it, and put the things that we can't predict on the rooftops. So that was the core idea.Now, we had to convince the library that social roles were equally important to media, in order to get them to accept this. What you're seeing here is actually their program on the left. That's as it was given to us in all of its clarity and glory. Our first operation was to re-digest it back to them, show it to them and say, \"You know what? We haven't touched it, but only one-third of your own program is dedicated to media and books. Two-thirds of it is already dedicated \u2014 that's the white band below, the thing you said isn't important \u2014 is already dedicated to social functions.\" So once we had presented that back to them, they agreed that this sort of core concept could work. We got the right to go back to first principles \u2014 that's the third diagram. We recombined everything. And then we started making new decisions.What you're seeing on the right is the design of the library, specifically in terms of square footage. On the left of that diagram, here, you'll see a series of five platforms \u2014 sort of combs, collective programs. And on the right are the more indeterminate spaces; things like reading rooms, whose evolution in 20, 30, 40 years we can't predict. So that literally was the design of the building. They signed it, and to their chagrin, we came back a week later, and we presented them this. And as you can see, it is literally the diagram on the right.(Laughter)We just sized \u2014 no, really, I mean that, literally. The things on the left-hand side of the diagram, those are the boxes. We sized them into five compartments. They're super-efficient. We had a very low budget to work with. We pushed them around on the site to make very literal contextual relationships. The reading room should be able to see the water. The main entrance should have a public plaza in front of it to abide by the zoning code, and so forth.So, you see the five platforms, those are the boxes. within each one, a very discrete thing is happening. The area in between is sort of an urban continuum, these things that we can't predict their evolution to the same degree. To give you some sense of the power of this idea, the biggest block is what we call the book spiral. It's literally built in a very inexpensive way \u2014 it is a parking garage for books. It just so happens to be on the 6th through 10th floors of the building, but that is not necessarily an expensive approach. And it allows us to organize the entire Dewey Decimal System on one continuous run; no matter how it grows or contracts within the building, it will always have its clarity to end the sort of trail of tears that we've all experienced in public libraries.(Laughter)And so this was the final operation, which was to take these blocks as they were all pushed off kilter, and to hold onto them with a skin. That skin serves double duty, again, for economics. One, it is the lateral stability for the entire building; it's a structural element. But its dimensions were designed not only for structure, but also for holding on every piece of glass. The glass was then \u2014 I'll use the word impregnated \u2014 but it had a layer of metal that was called \"stretched metal.\" That metal acts as a microlouver, so from the exterior of the building, the sun sees it as totally opaque, but from the interior, it's entirely transparent.So now I'm going to take you on a tour of the building. Let me see if I can find it. For anyone who gets motion sickness, I apologize. So, this is the building. And I think what's important is, when we first unveiled the building, the public saw it as being totally about our whim and ego. And it was defended, believe it or not, by the librarians. They said, \"Look, we don't know what it is, but we know it's everything that we need it to be, based on the observations that we've done about the program.\" This is going into one of the entries. So, it's an unusual building for a public library, obviously.So now we're going into what we call the living room. This is actually a program that we invented with the library. It was recognizing that public libraries are the last vestige of public free space. There are plenty of shopping malls that allow you to get out of the rain in downtown Seattle, but there are not so many free places that allow you to get out of the rain. So this was an unprogrammed area where people could pretty much do anything, including eat, yell, play chess and so forth.Now we're moving up into what we call the mixing chamber. That was the main technology area in the building. You'll have to tell me if I'm going too fast for you. And now up. This is actually the place that we put into the building so I could propose to my wife, right there.(Laughter)She said yes.(Laughter)I'm running out of time, so I'm actually going to stop. I can show this to you later. But let's see if I can very quickly get into the book spiral, because I think it's, as I said, the most \u2014 this is the main reading room \u2014 the most unique part of the building. You dizzy yet? Ok, so here, this is the book spiral. So, it's very indiscernible, but it's actually a continuous stair-stepping. It allows you to, on one city block, go up one full floor, so that it's on a continuum.Ok, now I'm going to go back, and I'm going to hit a second project. I'm going to go very, very quickly through this. Now this is the Dallas Theater. It was an unusual client for us, because they came to us and they said, \"We need you to do a new building. We've been working in a temporary space for 30 years, but because of that temporary space, we've become an infamous theater company. Theater is really focused in New York, Chicago and Seattle, with the exception of the Dallas Theater Company.\" And the very fact that they worked in a provisional space meant that for Beckett, they could blow out a wall; they could do \"Cherry Orchard\" and blow a hole through the floor, and so forth.So it was a very daunting task for us to do a brand-new building that could be a pristine building, but keep this kind of experimental nature. And the second is, they were what we call a multi-form theater, they do different kinds of performances in repertory. So they in the morning will do something in arena, then they'll do something in proscenium and so forth. And so they needed to be able to quickly transform between different theater organizations, and for operational budget reasons, this actually no longer happens in pretty much any multi-form theater in the United States, so we needed to figure out a way to overcome that.So our thought was to literally put the theater on its head: to take those things that were previously defined as front-of-house and back-of-house and stack them above house and below house, and to create what we called a theater machine. We invest the money in the operation of the building. It's almost as though the building could be placed anywhere, wherever you place it, the area under it is charged for theatrical performances. And it allowed us to go back to first principles, and redefine fly tower, acoustic enclosure, light enclosure and so forth. And at the push of a button, it allows the artistic director to move between proscenium, thrust, and in fact, arena and traverse and flat floor, in a very quick transfiguration.So in fact, using operational budget, we can \u2014 sorry, capital cost \u2014 we can actually achieve what was no longer achievable in operational cost. And that means that the artistic director now has a palette that he or she can choose from, between a series of forms and a series of processions, because that enclosure around the theater that is normally trapped with front-of-house and back-of-house spaces has been liberated. So an artistic director has the ability to have a performance that enters in a Wagnerian procession, shows the first act in thrust, the intermission in a Greek procession, second act in arena, and so forth.So I'm going to show you what this actually means. This is the theater up close. Any portion around the theater actually can be opened discretely. The light enclosure can be lifted separate to the acoustic enclosure, so you can do Beckett with Dallas as the backdrop. Portions can be opened, so you can now actually have motorcycles drive directly into the performance, or you can even just have an open-air performance, or for intermissions. The balconies all move to go between those configurations, but they also disappear. The proscenium line can also disappear. You can bring enormous objects in, so in fact, the Dallas Theater Company \u2014 their first show will be a play about Charles Lindbergh, and they'll want to bring in a real aircraft. And then it also provides them, in the off-season, the ability to actually rent out their space for entirely different things. This is it from a distance. Open up entire portions for different kinds of events. And at night. Again, remove the light enclosure; keep the acoustic enclosure. This is a monster truck show.I'm going to show now the last project. This also is an unusual client. They inverted the whole idea of development. They came to us and they said \u2014 unlike normal developers \u2014 they said, \"We want to start out by providing a contemporary art museum in Louisville. That's our main goal.\" And so instead of being a developer that sees an opportunity to make money, they saw an ability to be a catalyst in their downtown. And the fact that they wanted to support the contemporary art museum actually built their pro forma, so they worked in reverse. And that pro forma led us to a mixed-use building that was very large, in order to support their aspirations of the art, but it also opened up opportunities for the art itself to collaborate, interact with commercial spaces that actually artists more and more want to work within. And it also charged us with thinking about how to have something that was both a single building and a credible sort of sub-building.So this is Louisville's skyline, and I'm going to take you through the various constraints that led to the project. First: the physical constraints. We actually had to operate on three discrete sites, all of them well smaller than the size of the building. We had to operate next to the new Muhammad Ali Center, and respect it. We had to operate within the 100-year floodplain. Now, this area floods three to four times a year, and there's a levee behind our site, similar to the ones that broke in New Orleans. Had to operate behind the I-64 corridor, a street that cuts through the middle of these separate sites. So we're starting to build a sort of nightmare of constraints in a bathtub. Underneath the bathtub are the city's main power lines. And there is a pedestrian corridor that they wanted to add, that would link a series of cultural buildings, and a view corridor \u2014 because this is the historic district \u2014 that they didn't want to obstruct with a new building.(Laughter)And now we're going to add 1.1 million square feet. And if we did the traditional thing, that 1.1 million square feet \u2014 these are the different programs \u2014 the traditional thing would be to identify the public elements, place them on sites, and now we'd have a really terrible situation: a public thing in the middle of a bathtub that floods. And then we would size all the other elements \u2014 the different commercial elements: hotel, luxury housing, offices and so forth \u2014 and dump it on top. And we would create something that was unviable. In fact \u2014 and you know this \u2014 this is called the Time Warner Building.(Laughter)So our strategy was very simple. Just lift the entire block, flip some of the elements over, reposition them so they have appropriate views and relationships to downtown, and make circulation connections and reroute the road. So that's the basic concept, and now I'm going to show you what it leads to.Ok, it seems a very formal, willful gesture, but something derived entirely out of the constraints. And again, when we unveiled it, there was a sort of nervousness that this was about an architect making a statement, not an architect who was attempting to solve a series of problems. Now, within that center zone, as I said, we have the ability to mix a series of things. So here, this is sort of an x-ray \u2014 the towers are totally developer-driven. They told us the dimensions, the sizes and so forth, and we focused on taking all the public components \u2014 the lobbies, the bars \u2014 everything that different commercial elements would have, and combined it in the center, in the sort of subway map, in the transfer zone that would also include the contemporary art museum.So it creates a situation like this, where you have artists who can operate within an art space that also has an amazing view on the 22nd floor, but it also has proximity that the curator can either open or close. It allows people on exercise bicycles to be seen, or to see the art, and so forth. It also means that if an artist wants to invade something like a swimming pool, they can begin to do their exhibition in a swimming pool, so they're not forced to always work within the confines of a contemporary gallery space.So, how to build this. It's very simple: it's a chair. So, we begin by building the cores. As we're building the cores, we build the contemporary art museum at grade. That allows us to have incredible efficiency and cost efficiency. This is not a high-budget building. The moment the cores get to mid level, we finish the art museum; we put all the mechanical equipment in it; and then we jack it up into the air. This is how they build really large aircraft hangars, for instance, the ones that they did for the A380. Finish the cores, finish the meat and you get something that looks like this.Now I only have about 30 seconds, so I want to start an animation, and we'll conclude with that.Thank you.(Applause)Chris asked me to add \u2014 the theater is under construction, and this project will start construction in about a year, and finish in 2010.[identify public elements][insert public elements at

process.\n\n00:00:24.316 --> 00:00:28.213\nIt's a process that takes rationality\nalmost to an absurd level,\n\n00:00:28.237 --> 00:00:30.142\nand it transcends all the baggage\n\n00:00:30.166 --> 00:00:32.810\nthat normally comes\nwith what people would call,\n\n00:00:32.834 --> 00:00:34.934\nsort of a rational\nconclusion to something.\n\n00:00:34.958 --> 00:00:37.244\nAnd it concludes in something\nthat you see here,\n\n00:00:37.268 --> 00:00:41.049\nthat you actually wouldn't expect\nas being the result of rationality.\n\n00:00:42.028 --> 00:00:44.724\nThe second --\n\n00:00:44.748 --> 00:00:49.738\nthe second is that this process\ndoes not have a signature.\n\n00:00:49.762 --> 00:00:51.138\nThere is no authorship.\n\n00:00:51.162 --> 00:00:53.174\nArchitects are obsessed with authorship.\n\n00:00:53.198 --> 00:00:55.682\nThis is something that has\nediting and it has teams,\n\n00:00:55.706 --> 00:00:58.069\nbut in fact, we no longer\nsee within this process,\n\n00:00:58.093 --> 00:00:59.623\nthe traditional master architect\n\n00:00:59.647 --> 00:01:02.363\ncreating a sketch\nthat his minions carry out.\n\n00:01:03.697 --> 00:01:05.533\nAnd the third is that it challenges --\n\n00:01:05.557 --> 00:01:08.934\nand this is, in the length of this,\nvery hard to support why,\n\n00:01:08.958 --> 00:01:10.260\nconnect all these things --\n\n00:01:10.284 --> 00:01:13.487\nbut it challenges the high modernist\nnotion of flexibility.\n\n00:01:13.511 --> 00:01:17.151\nHigh modernists said we will create\nsort of singular spaces that are generic,\n\n00:01:17.175 --> 00:01:19.064\nalmost anything can happen within them.\n\n00:01:19.088 --> 00:01:21.114\nI call it sort of \"shotgun flexibility\" --\n\n00:01:21.138 --> 00:01:24.299\nturn your head this way; shoot;\nand you're bound to kill something.\n\n00:01:24.323 --> 00:01:26.398\nSo, this is the promise of high modernism:\n\n00:01:26.422 --> 00:01:29.645\nwithin a single space, actually,\nany kind of activity can happen.\n\n00:01:29.669 --> 00:01:31.934\nBut as we're seeing,\n\n00:01:31.958 --> 00:01:34.934\noperational costs are starting\nto dwarf capital costs\n\n00:01:34.958 --> 00:01:36.997\nin terms of design parameters.\n\n00:01:37.021 --> 00:01:38.741\nAnd so, with this sort of idea,\n\n00:01:38.765 --> 00:01:42.023\nwhat happens is, whatever actually\nis in the building on opening day,\n\n00:01:42.047 --> 00:01:44.310\nor whatever seems to be\nthe most immediate need,\n\n00:01:44.334 --> 00:01:47.606\nstarts to dwarf the possibility\nand sort of subsume it,\n\n00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:49.558\nof anything else could ever happen.\n\n00:01:49.582 --> 00:01:52.179\nAnd so we're proposing\na different kind of flexibility,\n\n00:01:52.203 --> 00:01:56.337\nsomething that we call\n\"compartmentalized flexibility.\"\n\n00:01:56.361 --> 00:01:58.700\nAnd the idea is that you,\nwithin that continuum,\n\n00:01:58.724 --> 00:02:01.852\nidentify a series of points,\nand you design specifically to them.\n\n00:02:01.876 --> 00:02:03.893\nThey can be pushed\noff-center a little bit,\n\n00:02:03.917 --> 00:02:06.030\nbut in the end you actually\nstill get as much\n\n00:02:06.054 --> 00:02:08.934\nof that original spectrum\nas you originally had hoped.\n\n00:02:08.958 --> 00:02:11.934\nWith high modernist flexibility,\nthat doesn't really work.\n\n00:02:12.421 --> 00:02:13.863\nNow I'm going to talk about --\n\n00:02:13.887 --> 00:02:16.196\nI'm going to build up\nthe Seattle Central Library\n\n00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:19.001\nin this way before your eyes\nin about five or six diagrams,\n\n00:02:19.025 --> 00:02:21.842\nand I truly mean this is the design\nprocess that you'll see.\n\n00:02:21.866 --> 00:02:24.170\nWith the library staff\nand the library board,\n\n00:02:24.194 --> 00:02:25.934\nwe settled on two core positions.\n\n00:02:25.958 --> 00:02:29.403\nThis is the first one, and this\nis showing, over the last 900 years,\n\n00:02:29.427 --> 00:02:33.046\nthe evolution of the book,\nand other technologies.\n\n00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:35.934\nThis diagram was our sort\nof position piece about the book,\n\n00:02:35.958 --> 00:02:38.474\nand our position was,\nbooks are technology --\n\n00:02:38.498 --> 00:02:40.086\nthat's something people forget --\n\n00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:43.272\nbut it's a form of technology\nthat will have to share its dominance\n\n00:02:43.296 --> 00:02:46.715\nwith any other form of truly potent\ntechnology or media.\n\n00:02:47.088 --> 00:02:48.240\nThe second premise --\n\n00:02:48.264 --> 00:02:50.755\nand this was something\nthat was very difficult for us\n\n00:02:50.779 --> 00:02:52.745\nto convince the librarians of at first --\n\n00:02:52.769 --> 00:02:56.552\nis that libraries, since the inception\nof Carnegie Library tradition in America,\n\n00:02:56.576 --> 00:02:59.459\nhad a second responsibility,\nand that was for social roles.\n\n00:02:59.483 --> 00:03:02.071\nOk, now, this I'll come back\nto later, but something --\n\n00:03:02.095 --> 00:03:05.302\nactually, the librarians at first said,\n\"No, this isn't our mandate.\n\n00:03:05.326 --> 00:03:08.032\nOur mandate is media,\nand particularly the book.\"\n\n00:03:09.421 --> 00:03:12.491\nSo what you're seeing now\nis actually the design of the building.\n\n00:03:12.515 --> 00:03:14.967\nThe upper diagram is what we had seen\n\n00:03:14.991 --> 00:03:19.532\nin a whole host of contemporary libraries\nthat used high modernist flexibility.\n\n00:03:19.556 --> 00:03:21.958\nSort of, any activity\ncould happen anywhere.\n\n00:03:22.637 --> 00:03:26.339\nWe don't know the future of the library;\nwe don't know the future of the book;\n\n00:03:26.363 --> 00:03:27.942\nand so, we'll use this approach.\n\n00:03:27.966 --> 00:03:31.146\nAnd what we saw were buildings\nthat were very generic, and worse --\n\n00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:32.868\nnot only were they very generic --\n\n00:03:32.892 --> 00:03:35.634\nso, not only does the reading room\nlook like the copy room\n\n00:03:35.658 --> 00:03:37.156\nlook like the magazine area --\n\n00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:40.906\nbut it meant that whatever issue\nwas troubling the library at that moment\n\n00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:44.445\nwas starting to engulf every other\nactivity that was happening in it.\n\n00:03:44.469 --> 00:03:46.718\nAnd in this case,\nwhat was getting engulfed\n\n00:03:46.742 --> 00:03:49.758\nwere these social responsibilities\nby the expansion of the book.\n\n00:03:49.782 --> 00:03:51.997\nAnd so we proposed\nwhat's at the lower diagram.\n\n00:03:52.021 --> 00:03:55.108\nVery dumb approach:\nsimply compartmentalize.\n\n00:03:55.132 --> 00:03:57.585\nPut those things whose evolution\nwe could predict --\n\n00:03:57.609 --> 00:04:01.192\nand I don't mean that we could say\nwhat would actually happen in the future,\n\n00:04:01.216 --> 00:04:05.102\nbut we have some certainty of the spectrum\nof what would happen in the future --\n\n00:04:05.126 --> 00:04:07.376\nput those in boxes designed\nspecifically for it,\n\n00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:10.094\nand put the things that we can't\npredict on the rooftops.\n\n00:04:10.118 --> 00:04:11.365\nSo that was the core idea.\n\n00:04:11.389 --> 00:04:13.083\nNow, we had to convince the library\n\n00:04:13.107 --> 00:04:16.773\nthat social roles were\nequally important to media,\n\n00:04:16.797 --> 00:04:18.576\nin order to get them to accept this.\n\n00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:21.600\nWhat you're seeing here is actually\ntheir program on the left.\n\n00:04:21.624 --> 00:04:25.661\nThat's as it was given to us\nin all of its clarity and glory.\n\n00:04:25.685 --> 00:04:29.973\nOur first operation was to re-digest it\nback to them, show it to them and say,\n\n00:04:29.997 --> 00:04:31.934\n\"You know what? We haven't touched it,\n\n00:04:31.958 --> 00:04:35.345\nbut only one-third of your own program\nis dedicated to media and books.\n\n00:04:35.369 --> 00:04:37.318\nTwo-thirds of it is already dedicated --\n\n00:04:37.342 --> 00:04:40.453\nthat's the white band below,\nthe thing you said isn't important --\n\n00:04:40.477 --> 00:04:42.486\nis already dedicated to social functions.\"\n\n00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:44.691\nSo once we had presented\nthat back to them,\n\n00:04:44.715 --> 00:04:47.286\nthey agreed that this sort\nof core concept could work.\n\n00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:49.664\nWe got the right to go back\nto first principles --\n\n00:04:49.688 --> 00:04:50.898\nthat's the third diagram.\n\n00:04:50.922 --> 00:04:52.128\nWe recombined everything.\n\n00:04:52.152 --> 00:04:54.110\nAnd then we started making new decisions.\n\n00:04:54.134 --> 00:04:57.007\nWhat you're seeing on the right\nis the design of the library,\n\n00:04:57.031 --> 00:04:58.952\nspecifically in terms of square footage.\n\n00:04:58.976 --> 00:05:03.934\nOn the left of that diagram, here,\nyou'll see a series of five platforms --\n\n00:05:03.958 --> 00:05:05.934\nsort of combs, collective programs.\n\n00:05:05.958 --> 00:05:08.363\nAnd on the right are the more\nindeterminate spaces;\n\n00:05:08.387 --> 00:05:09.638\nthings like reading rooms,\n\n00:05:09.662 --> 00:05:12.347\nwhose evolution in 20, 30, 40 years\nwe can't predict.\n\n00:05:12.371 --> 00:05:14.680\nSo that literally was the design\nof the building.\n\n00:05:14.704 --> 00:05:16.839\nThey signed it, and to their chagrin,\n\n00:05:16.863 --> 00:05:19.934\nwe came back a week later,\nand we presented them this.\n\n00:05:19.958 --> 00:05:22.855\nAnd as you can see, it is literally\nthe diagram on the right.\n\n00:05:22.879 --> 00:05:23.880\n(Laughter)\n\n00:05:23.904 --> 00:05:26.334\nWe just sized -- no, really,\nI mean that, literally.\n\n00:05:26.358 --> 00:05:28.720\nThe things on the left-hand side\nof the diagram,\n\n00:05:28.744 --> 00:05:29.934\nthose are the boxes.\n\n00:05:29.958 --> 00:05:32.887\nWe sized them into five compartments.\nThey're super-efficient.\n\n00:05:32.911 --> 00:05:34.783\nWe had a very low budget to work with.\n\n00:05:34.807 --> 00:05:36.387\nWe pushed them around on the site\n\n00:05:36.411 --> 00:05:38.624\nto make very literal\ncontextual relationships.\n\n00:05:38.648 --> 00:05:40.961\nThe reading room\nshould be able to see the water.\n\n00:05:40.985 --> 00:05:43.766\nThe main entrance should have\na public plaza in front of it\n\n00:05:43.790 --> 00:05:45.911\nto abide by the zoning code, and so forth.\n\n00:05:46.355 --> 00:05:48.808\nSo, you see the five platforms,\nthose are the boxes.\n\n00:05:48.832 --> 00:05:51.261\nwithin each one, a very discrete\nthing is happening.\n\n00:05:51.285 --> 00:05:53.632\nThe area in between\nis sort of an urban continuum,\n\n00:05:53.656 --> 00:05:57.006\nthese things that we can't predict\ntheir evolution to the same degree.\n\n00:05:57.448 --> 00:05:59.934\nTo give you some sense\nof the power of this idea,\n\n00:05:59.958 --> 00:06:02.934\nthe biggest block\nis what we call the book spiral.\n\n00:06:02.958 --> 00:06:05.292\nIt's literally built\nin a very inexpensive way --\n\n00:06:05.316 --> 00:06:07.934\nit is a parking garage for books.\n\n00:06:07.958 --> 00:06:11.445\nIt just so happens to be on the 6th\nthrough 10th floors of the building,\n\n00:06:11.469 --> 00:06:14.744\nbut that is not necessarily\nan expensive approach.\n\n00:06:14.768 --> 00:06:17.594\nAnd it allows us to organize\nthe entire Dewey Decimal System\n\n00:06:17.618 --> 00:06:21.489\non one continuous run; no matter how it\ngrows or contracts within the building,\n\n00:06:21.513 --> 00:06:25.934\nit will always have its clarity\nto end the sort of trail of tears\n\n00:06:25.958 --> 00:06:28.687\nthat we've all experienced\nin public libraries.\n\n00:06:28.711 --> 00:06:29.934\n(Laughter)\n\n00:06:29.958 --> 00:06:31.689\nAnd so this was the final operation,\n\n00:06:31.713 --> 00:06:34.834\nwhich was to take these blocks\nas they were all pushed off kilter,\n\n00:06:34.858 --> 00:06:36.934\nand to hold onto them with a skin.\n\n00:06:36.958 --> 00:06:39.934\nThat skin serves double duty,\nagain, for economics.\n\n00:06:39.958 --> 00:06:42.934\nOne, it is the lateral stability\nfor the entire building;\n\n00:06:42.958 --> 00:06:44.220\nit's a structural element.\n\n00:06:44.244 --> 00:06:46.871\nBut its dimensions were designed\nnot only for structure,\n\n00:06:46.895 --> 00:06:49.146\nbut also for holding on\nevery piece of glass.\n\n00:06:49.170 --> 00:06:51.934\nThe glass was then --\nI'll use the word impregnated --\n\n00:06:51.958 --> 00:06:55.370\nbut it had a layer of metal\nthat was called \"stretched metal.\"\n\n00:06:55.394 --> 00:06:57.232\nThat metal acts as a microlouver,\n\n00:06:57.256 --> 00:07:00.637\nso from the exterior of the building,\nthe sun sees it as totally opaque,\n\n00:07:00.661 --> 00:07:03.335\nbut from the interior,\nit's entirely transparent.\n\n00:07:03.359 --> 00:07:06.106\nSo now I'm going to take you\non a tour of the building.\n\n00:07:06.829 --> 00:07:08.203\nLet me see if I can find it.\n\n00:07:08.227 --> 00:07:11.496\nFor anyone who gets\nmotion sickness, I apologize.\n\n00:07:12.191 --> 00:07:13.619\nSo, this is the building.\n\n00:07:15.987 --> 00:07:19.844\nAnd I think what's important is,\nwhen we first unveiled the building,\n\n00:07:19.868 --> 00:07:23.934\nthe public saw it as being\ntotally about our whim and ego.\n\n00:07:23.958 --> 00:07:26.800\nAnd it was defended,\nbelieve it or not, by the librarians.\n\n00:07:26.824 --> 00:07:28.848\nThey said, \"Look,\nwe don't know what it is,\n\n00:07:28.872 --> 00:07:31.237\nbut we know it's everything\nthat we need it to be,\n\n00:07:31.261 --> 00:07:34.397\nbased on the observations\nthat we've done about the program.\"\n\n00:07:37.043 --> 00:07:39.027\nThis is going into one of the entries.\n\n00:07:39.051 --> 00:07:42.412\nSo, it's an unusual building\nfor a public library, obviously.\n\n00:07:45.958 --> 00:07:49.559\nSo now we're going\ninto what we call the living room.\n\n00:07:49.583 --> 00:07:52.455\nThis is actually a program\nthat we invented with the library.\n\n00:07:52.479 --> 00:07:54.396\nIt was recognizing that public libraries\n\n00:07:54.420 --> 00:07:57.205\nare the last vestige of public free space.\n\n00:07:57.229 --> 00:08:00.657\nThere are plenty of shopping malls\nthat allow you to get out of the rain\n\n00:08:00.681 --> 00:08:01.837\nin downtown Seattle,\n\n00:08:01.861 --> 00:08:04.788\nbut there are not so many free places\n\n00:08:04.812 --> 00:08:06.633\nthat allow you to get out of the rain.\n\n00:08:06.657 --> 00:08:10.243\nSo this was an unprogrammed area where\npeople could pretty much do anything,\n\n00:08:10.267 --> 00:08:12.376\nincluding eat, yell,\nplay chess and so forth.\n\n00:08:12.400 --> 00:08:16.406\nNow we're moving up into what we call\nthe mixing chamber.\n\n00:08:16.430 --> 00:08:19.358\nThat was the main\ntechnology area in the building.\n\n00:08:19.382 --> 00:08:21.958\nYou'll have to tell me\nif I'm going too fast for you.\n\n00:08:26.159 --> 00:08:27.309\nAnd now up.\n\n00:08:32.524 --> 00:08:35.153\nThis is actually the place\nthat we put into the building\n\n00:08:35.177 --> 00:08:37.210\nso I could propose\nto my wife, right there.\n\n00:08:37.234 --> 00:08:39.353\n(Laughter)\n\n00:08:39.958 --> 00:08:41.117\nShe said yes.\n\n00:08:41.141 --> 00:08:43.141\n(Laughter)\n\n00:08:44.551 --> 00:08:47.132\nI'm running out of time,\nso I'm actually going to stop.\n\n00:08:47.156 --> 00:08:48.934\nI can show this to you later.\n\n00:08:48.958 --> 00:08:52.241\nBut let's see if I can very quickly\nget into the book spiral,\n\n00:08:52.265 --> 00:08:54.329\nbecause I think it's,\nas I said, the most --\n\n00:08:54.353 --> 00:08:57.670\nthis is the main reading room --\nthe most unique part of the building.\n\n00:08:58.726 --> 00:08:59.892\nYou dizzy yet?\n\n00:09:01.099 --> 00:09:02.924\nOk, so here, this is the book spiral.\n\n00:09:08.353 --> 00:09:10.286\nSo, it's very indiscernible,\n\n00:09:10.310 --> 00:09:13.811\nbut it's actually\na continuous stair-stepping.\n\n00:09:13.835 --> 00:09:15.827\nIt allows you to, on one city block,\n\n00:09:15.851 --> 00:09:18.546\ngo up one full floor,\nso that it's on a continuum.\n\n00:09:23.449 --> 00:09:26.934\nOk, now I'm going to go back,\nand I'm going to hit a second project.\n\n00:09:26.958 --> 00:09:29.221\nI'm going to go very,\nvery quickly through this.\n\n00:09:29.245 --> 00:09:30.925\nNow this is the Dallas Theater.\n\n00:09:30.949 --> 00:09:34.297\nIt was an unusual client for us,\nbecause they came to us and they said,\n\n00:09:34.321 --> 00:09:36.027\n\"We need you to do a new building.\n\n00:09:36.051 --> 00:09:39.477\nWe've been working\nin a temporary space for 30 years,\n\n00:09:39.501 --> 00:09:41.224\nbut because of that temporary space,\n\n00:09:41.248 --> 00:09:44.111\nwe've become an infamous theater company.\n\n00:09:44.135 --> 00:09:47.096\nTheater is really focused in New York,\nChicago and Seattle,\n\n00:09:47.120 --> 00:09:50.217\nwith the exception\nof the Dallas Theater Company.\"\n\n00:09:50.241 --> 00:09:52.937\nAnd the very fact that they worked\nin a provisional space\n\n00:09:52.961 --> 00:09:55.404\nmeant that for Beckett,\nthey could blow out a wall;\n\n00:09:55.428 --> 00:09:59.170\nthey could do \"Cherry Orchard\" and blow\na hole through the floor, and so forth.\n\n00:09:59.194 --> 00:10:02.226\nSo it was a very daunting task\nfor us to do a brand-new building\n\n00:10:02.250 --> 00:10:04.304\nthat could be a pristine building,\n\n00:10:04.328 --> 00:10:06.347\nbut keep this kind of experimental nature.\n\n00:10:06.371 --> 00:10:07.569\nAnd the second is,\n\n00:10:07.593 --> 00:10:10.471\nthey were what we call\na multi-form theater,\n\n00:10:10.495 --> 00:10:13.101\nthey do different kinds\nof performances in repertory.\n\n00:10:13.125 --> 00:10:15.934\nSo they in the morning\nwill do something in arena,\n\n00:10:15.958 --> 00:10:18.451\nthen they'll do something\nin proscenium and so forth.\n\n00:10:18.475 --> 00:10:20.824\nAnd so they needed to be able\nto quickly transform\n\n00:10:20.848 --> 00:10:22.774\nbetween different theater organizations,\n\n00:10:22.798 --> 00:10:24.483\nand for operational budget reasons,\n\n00:10:24.507 --> 00:10:26.670\nthis actually no longer\nhappens in pretty much\n\n00:10:26.694 --> 00:10:28.934\nany multi-form theater\nin the United States,\n\n00:10:28.958 --> 00:10:31.433\nso we needed to figure out\na way to overcome that.\n\n00:10:31.457 --> 00:10:34.280\nSo our thought was to literally\nput the theater on its head:\n\n00:10:34.304 --> 00:10:36.614\nto take those things\nthat were previously defined\n\n00:10:36.638 --> 00:10:38.313\nas front-of-house and back-of-house\n\n00:10:38.337 --> 00:10:40.345\nand stack them above house\nand below house,\n\n00:10:40.369 --> 00:10:42.568\nand to create what we called\na theater machine.\n\n00:10:42.592 --> 00:10:45.075\nWe invest the money\nin the operation of the building.\n\n00:10:45.099 --> 00:10:47.921\nIt's almost as though the building\ncould be placed anywhere,\n\n00:10:47.945 --> 00:10:49.097\nwherever you place it,\n\n00:10:49.121 --> 00:10:51.851\nthe area under it is charged\nfor theatrical performances.\n\n00:10:51.875 --> 00:10:54.197\nAnd it allowed us to go back\nto first principles,\n\n00:10:54.221 --> 00:10:57.803\nand redefine fly tower, acoustic\nenclosure, light enclosure and so forth.\n\n00:10:57.827 --> 00:10:59.297\nAnd at the push of a button,\n\n00:10:59.321 --> 00:11:02.948\nit allows the artistic director\nto move between proscenium, thrust,\n\n00:11:02.972 --> 00:11:06.763\nand in fact, arena\nand traverse and flat floor,\n\n00:11:06.787 --> 00:11:09.182\nin a very quick transfiguration.\n\n00:11:09.206 --> 00:11:12.628\nSo in fact, using\noperational budget, we can --\n\n00:11:12.652 --> 00:11:14.844\nsorry, capital cost --\nwe can actually achieve\n\n00:11:14.868 --> 00:11:17.339\nwhat was no longer achievable\nin operational cost.\n\n00:11:17.856 --> 00:11:19.809\nAnd that means that the artistic director\n\n00:11:19.833 --> 00:11:22.198\nnow has a palette that he or she\ncan choose from,\n\n00:11:22.222 --> 00:11:25.720\nbetween a series of forms\nand a series of processions,\n\n00:11:25.744 --> 00:11:28.868\nbecause that enclosure around the theater\nthat is normally trapped\n\n00:11:28.892 --> 00:11:31.934\nwith front-of-house and back-of-house\nspaces has been liberated.\n\n00:11:31.958 --> 00:11:35.227\nSo an artistic director has the ability\nto have a performance\n\n00:11:35.251 --> 00:11:37.366\nthat enters in a Wagnerian procession,\n\n00:11:37.390 --> 00:11:39.725\nshows the first act in thrust,\n\n00:11:39.749 --> 00:11:42.934\nthe intermission in a Greek procession,\n\n00:11:42.958 --> 00:11:44.776\nsecond act in arena, and so forth.\n\n00:11:45.212 --> 00:11:47.563\nSo I'm going to show you\nwhat this actually means.\n\n00:11:47.587 --> 00:11:49.355\nThis is the theater up close.\n\n00:11:49.379 --> 00:11:52.465\nAny portion around the theater\nactually can be opened discretely.\n\n00:11:54.473 --> 00:11:58.371\nThe light enclosure can be lifted\nseparate to the acoustic enclosure,\n\n00:11:58.395 --> 00:12:00.879\nso you can do Beckett\nwith Dallas as the backdrop.\n\n00:12:02.104 --> 00:12:03.269\nPortions can be opened,\n\n00:12:03.293 --> 00:12:06.936\nso you can now actually have motorcycles\ndrive directly into the performance,\n\n00:12:06.960 --> 00:12:09.362\nor you can even just have\nan open-air performance,\n\n00:12:09.386 --> 00:12:10.552\nor for intermissions.\n\n00:12:11.052 --> 00:12:13.785\nThe balconies all move to go\nbetween those configurations,\n\n00:12:13.809 --> 00:12:15.094\nbut they also disappear.\n\n00:12:15.475 --> 00:12:17.595\nThe proscenium line can also disappear.\n\n00:12:18.087 --> 00:12:19.928\nYou can bring enormous objects in,\n\n00:12:19.952 --> 00:12:21.943\nso in fact, the Dallas Theater Company --\n\n00:12:21.967 --> 00:12:24.618\ntheir first show will be a play\nabout Charles Lindbergh,\n\n00:12:24.642 --> 00:12:26.934\nand they'll want to bring in\na real aircraft.\n\n00:12:26.958 --> 00:12:29.569\nAnd then it also provides them,\nin the off-season,\n\n00:12:29.593 --> 00:12:34.799\nthe ability to actually rent out\ntheir space for entirely different things.\n\n00:12:35.958 --> 00:12:38.613\nThis is it from a distance.\n\n00:12:40.879 --> 00:12:43.867\nOpen up entire portions\nfor different kinds of events.\n\n00:12:43.891 --> 00:12:45.042\nAnd at night.\n\n00:12:47.050 --> 00:12:50.928\nAgain, remove the light enclosure;\nkeep the acoustic enclosure.\n\n00:12:51.634 --> 00:12:53.512\nThis is a monster truck show.\n\n00:12:53.536 --> 00:12:55.427\nI'm going to show now the last project.\n\n00:12:55.451 --> 00:12:56.934\nThis also is an unusual client.\n\n00:12:56.958 --> 00:12:59.431\nThey inverted the whole idea\nof development.\n\n00:12:59.455 --> 00:13:02.282\nThey came to us and they said --\nunlike normal developers --\n\n00:13:02.306 --> 00:13:03.843\nthey said, \"We want to start out\n\n00:13:03.867 --> 00:13:06.616\nby providing a contemporary\nart museum in Louisville.\n\n00:13:06.640 --> 00:13:07.844\nThat's our main goal.\"\n\n00:13:07.868 --> 00:13:11.463\nAnd so instead of being a developer\nthat sees an opportunity to make money,\n\n00:13:11.487 --> 00:13:14.508\nthey saw an ability to be\na catalyst in their downtown.\n\n00:13:14.532 --> 00:13:18.112\nAnd the fact that they wanted to support\nthe contemporary art museum\n\n00:13:18.136 --> 00:13:19.693\nactually built their pro forma,\n\n00:13:19.717 --> 00:13:21.034\nso they worked in reverse.\n\n00:13:21.389 --> 00:13:22.934\nAnd that pro forma led us\n\n00:13:22.958 --> 00:13:25.934\nto a mixed-use building\nthat was very large,\n\n00:13:25.958 --> 00:13:28.262\nin order to support\ntheir aspirations of the art,\n\n00:13:28.286 --> 00:13:30.833\nbut it also opened up opportunities\nfor the art itself\n\n00:13:30.857 --> 00:13:33.077\nto collaborate, interact\nwith commercial spaces\n\n00:13:33.101 --> 00:13:35.861\nthat actually artists more\nand more want to work within.\n\n00:13:36.314 --> 00:13:39.339\nAnd it also charged us\nwith thinking about how to have\n\n00:13:39.363 --> 00:13:41.327\nsomething that was both a single building\n\n00:13:41.351 --> 00:13:43.934\nand a credible sort of sub-building.\n\n00:13:43.958 --> 00:13:46.501\nSo this is Louisville's skyline,\n\n00:13:46.525 --> 00:13:49.205\nand I'm going to take\nyou through the various constraints\n\n00:13:49.229 --> 00:13:50.422\nthat led to the project.\n\n00:13:50.446 --> 00:13:51.985\nFirst: the physical constraints.\n\n00:13:52.009 --> 00:13:54.410\nWe actually had to operate\non three discrete sites,\n\n00:13:54.434 --> 00:13:57.315\nall of them well smaller\nthan the size of the building.\n\n00:13:57.339 --> 00:14:01.022\nWe had to operate next to the new\nMuhammad Ali Center, and respect it.\n\n00:14:01.046 --> 00:14:03.344\nWe had to operate\nwithin the 100-year floodplain.\n\n00:14:03.368 --> 00:14:05.683\nNow, this area floods\nthree to four times a year,\n\n00:14:05.707 --> 00:14:07.444\nand there's a levee behind our site,\n\n00:14:07.468 --> 00:14:09.748\nsimilar to the ones\nthat broke in New Orleans.\n\n00:14:10.645 --> 00:14:14.847\nHad to operate behind the I-64 corridor,\n\n00:14:14.871 --> 00:14:17.787\na street that cuts through the middle\nof these separate sites.\n\n00:14:17.811 --> 00:14:22.377\nSo we're starting to build a sort of\nnightmare of constraints in a bathtub.\n\n00:14:22.401 --> 00:14:25.790\nUnderneath the bathtub\nare the city's main power lines.\n\n00:14:26.657 --> 00:14:29.458\nAnd there is a pedestrian corridor\nthat they wanted to add,\n\n00:14:29.482 --> 00:14:32.432\nthat would link a series\nof cultural buildings,\n\n00:14:32.456 --> 00:14:35.422\nand a view corridor --\nbecause this is the historic district --\n\n00:14:35.446 --> 00:14:37.994\nthat they didn't want to obstruct\nwith a new building.\n\n00:14:38.018 --> 00:14:39.058\n(Laughter)\n\n00:14:39.082 --> 00:14:41.655\nAnd now we're going to add\n1.1 million square feet.\n\n00:14:42.083 --> 00:14:45.298\nAnd if we did the traditional thing,\nthat 1.1 million square feet --\n\n00:14:45.322 --> 00:14:46.994\nthese are the different programs --\n\n00:14:47.018 --> 00:14:50.982\nthe traditional thing would be to identify\nthe public elements, place them on sites,\n\n00:14:51.006 --> 00:14:53.181\nand now we'd have a really\nterrible situation:\n\n00:14:53.205 --> 00:14:55.934\na public thing in the middle\nof a bathtub that floods.\n\n00:14:56.958 --> 00:14:59.555\nAnd then we would size\nall the other elements --\n\n00:14:59.579 --> 00:15:01.234\nthe different commercial elements:\n\n00:15:01.258 --> 00:15:03.401\nhotel, luxury housing,\noffices and so forth --\n\n00:15:03.425 --> 00:15:04.630\nand dump it on top.\n\n00:15:04.654 --> 00:15:07.618\nAnd we would create\nsomething that was unviable.\n\n00:15:07.642 --> 00:15:11.387\nIn fact -- and you know this -- this\nis called the Time Warner Building.\n\n00:15:11.411 --> 00:15:13.085\n(Laughter)\n\n00:15:13.109 --> 00:15:14.934\nSo our strategy was very simple.\n\n00:15:14.958 --> 00:15:18.069\nJust lift the entire block,\n\n00:15:18.093 --> 00:15:19.728\nflip some of the elements over,\n\n00:15:19.752 --> 00:15:22.562\nreposition them\nso they have appropriate views\n\n00:15:22.586 --> 00:15:24.222\nand relationships to downtown,\n\n00:15:24.246 --> 00:15:27.699\nand make circulation connections\nand reroute the road.\n\n00:15:27.723 --> 00:15:29.250\nSo that's the basic concept,\n\n00:15:29.274 --> 00:15:31.604\nand now I'm going to show you\nwhat it leads to.\n\n00:15:32.874 --> 00:15:35.429\nOk, it seems a very formal,\nwillful gesture,\n\n00:15:35.453 --> 00:15:38.001\nbut something derived entirely\nout of the constraints.\n\n00:15:38.025 --> 00:15:41.006\nAnd again, when we unveiled it,\nthere was a sort of nervousness\n\n00:15:41.030 --> 00:15:43.467\nthat this was about an architect\nmaking a statement,\n\n00:15:43.491 --> 00:15:47.083\nnot an architect who was attempting\nto solve a series of problems.\n\n00:15:47.107 --> 00:15:49.401\nNow, within that center zone, as I said,\n\n00:15:49.425 --> 00:15:51.580\nwe have the ability to mix\na series of things.\n\n00:15:51.604 --> 00:15:54.327\nSo here, this is sort of an x-ray --\n\n00:15:54.351 --> 00:15:56.286\nthe towers are totally developer-driven.\n\n00:15:56.310 --> 00:15:58.760\nThey told us the dimensions,\nthe sizes and so forth,\n\n00:15:58.784 --> 00:16:01.281\nand we focused on taking\nall the public components --\n\n00:16:01.305 --> 00:16:02.597\nthe lobbies, the bars --\n\n00:16:02.621 --> 00:16:05.934\neverything that different commercial\nelements would have,\n\n00:16:05.958 --> 00:16:08.934\nand combined it in the center,\nin the sort of subway map,\n\n00:16:08.958 --> 00:16:12.676\nin the transfer zone that would also\ninclude the contemporary art museum.\n\n00:16:12.700 --> 00:16:16.765\nSo it creates a situation like this,\nwhere you have artists who can operate\n\n00:16:16.789 --> 00:16:20.667\nwithin an art space that also has\nan amazing view on the 22nd floor,\n\n00:16:20.691 --> 00:16:24.148\nbut it also has proximity that the curator\ncan either open or close.\n\n00:16:24.172 --> 00:16:27.378\nIt allows people\non exercise bicycles to be seen,\n\n00:16:27.402 --> 00:16:29.077\nor to see the art, and so forth.\n\n00:16:29.101 --> 00:16:32.821\nIt also means that if an artist wants\nto invade something like a swimming pool,\n\n00:16:32.845 --> 00:16:35.555\nthey can begin to do their exhibition\nin a swimming pool,\n\n00:16:35.579 --> 00:16:38.216\nso they're not forced to always\nwork within the confines\n\n00:16:38.240 --> 00:16:39.775\nof a contemporary gallery space.\n\n00:16:39.799 --> 00:16:40.966\nSo, how to build this.\n\n00:16:40.990 --> 00:16:42.934\nIt's very simple: it's a chair.\n\n00:16:42.958 --> 00:16:46.390\nSo, we begin by building the cores.\n\n00:16:46.414 --> 00:16:49.958\nAs we're building the cores, we build\nthe contemporary art museum at grade.\n\n00:16:49.982 --> 00:16:53.048\nThat allows us to have\nincredible efficiency and cost efficiency.\n\n00:16:53.072 --> 00:16:54.773\nThis is not a high-budget building.\n\n00:16:54.797 --> 00:16:56.646\nThe moment the cores get to mid level,\n\n00:16:56.670 --> 00:16:59.865\nwe finish the art museum; we put\nall the mechanical equipment in it;\n\n00:16:59.889 --> 00:17:01.634\nand then we jack it up into the air.\n\n00:17:01.658 --> 00:17:04.147\nThis is how they build\nreally large aircraft hangars,\n\n00:17:04.171 --> 00:17:06.531\nfor instance, the ones\nthat they did for the A380.\n\n00:17:06.555 --> 00:17:08.395\nFinish the cores, finish the meat\n\n00:17:08.419 --> 00:17:10.432\nand you get something\nthat looks like this.\n\n00:17:10.456 --> 00:17:12.034\nNow I only have about 30 seconds,\n\n00:17:12.058 --> 00:17:13.956\nso I want to start an animation,\n\n00:17:13.980 --> 00:17:15.375\nand we'll conclude with that.\n\n00:17:15.399 --> 00:17:16.787\nThank you.\n\n00:17:16.811 --> 00:17:20.934\n(Applause)\n\n00:17:20.958 --> 00:17:22.934\nChris asked me to add --\n\n00:17:22.958 --> 00:17:24.734\nthe theater is under construction,\n\n00:17:24.758 --> 00:17:27.482\nand this project will start\nconstruction in about a

I love this wonderful gathering. And you must be wondering, \"What on earth? Have they put up the wrong slide?\" No, no. Look at this magnificent beast, and ask the question: Who designed it?This is TED; this is Technology, Entertainment, Design, and there's a dairy cow. It's a quite wonderfully designed animal. And I was thinking, how do I introduce this? And I thought, well, maybe that old doggerel by Joyce Kilmer, you know: \"Poems are made by fools like me, but only God can make a tree.\" And you might say, \"Well, God designed the cow.\"But, of course, God got a lot of help. This is the ancestor of cattle. This is the aurochs. And it was designed by natural selection, the process of natural selection, over many millions of years. And then it became domesticated, thousands of years ago. And human beings became its stewards, and, without even knowing what they were doing, they gradually redesigned it and redesigned it and redesigned it. And then more recently, they really began to do reverse engineering on this beast and figure out just what the parts were, how they worked and how they might be optimized \u2014 how they might be made better.Now, why am I talking about cows? Because I want to say that much the same thing is true of religions. Religions are natural phenomena \u2014 they're just as natural as cows. They have evolved over millennia. They have a biological base, just like the aurochs. They have become domesticated, and human beings have been redesigning their religions for thousands of years. This is TED, and I want to talk about design. Because what I've been doing for the last four years \u2014 really since the first time you saw me \u2014 some of you saw me at TED when I was talking about religion \u2014 and in the last four years, I've been working just about non-stop on this topic. And you might say it's about the reverse engineering of religions. Now that very idea, I think, strikes terror in many people, or anger, or anxiety of one sort or another. And that is the spell that I want to break.I want to say, no, religions are an important natural phenomenon. We should study them with the same intensity that we study all the other important natural phenomena, like global warming, as we heard so eloquently last night from Al Gore. Today's religions are brilliantly designed \u2014 brilliantly designed. They are immensely powerful social institutions and many of their features can be traced back to earlier features that we can really make sense of by reverse engineering. And, as with the cow, there's a mixture of evolutionary design \u2014 designed by natural selection itself \u2014 and intelligent design \u2014 more or less intelligent design \u2014 and redesigned by human beings who are trying to redesign their religions.You don't do book talks at TED, but I'm going to have just one slide about my book, because there is one message in it which I think this group really needs to hear. And I would be very interested to get your responses to this. It's the one policy proposal that I make in the book, at this time, when I claim not to know enough about religion to know what other policy proposals to make. And it's one that echoes remarks that you've heard already today.Here's my proposal, I'm going to just take a couple of minutes to explain it: Education on world religions for all of our children \u2014 in primary school, in high school, in public schools, in private schools and in home schooling. So what I'm proposing is, just as we require reading, writing, arithmetic, American history, so we should have a curriculum on facts about all the religions of the world \u2014 about their history, about their creeds, about their texts, their music, their symbolisms, their prohibitions, their requirements. And this should be presented factually, straightforwardly, with no particular spin, to all of the children in the country. And as long as you teach them that, you can teach them anything else you like. That, I think, is maximal tolerance for religious freedom. As long as you inform your children about other religions, then you may \u2014 and as early as you like and whatever you like \u2014 teach them whatever creed you want them to learn. But also let them know about other religions.Now, why do I say that? Because democracy depends on an informed citizenship. Informed consent is the very bedrock of our understanding of democracy. Misinformed consent is not worth it. It's like a coin flip; it doesn't count, really. Democracy depends on informed consent. This is the way we treat people as responsible adults. Now, children below the age of consent are a special case. Parents \u2014 I'm going to use a word that Pastor Rick just used \u2014 parents are stewards of their children. They don't own them. You can't own your children. You have a responsibility to the world, to the state, to them, to take care of them right. You may teach them whatever creed you think is most important, but I say you have a responsibility to let them be informed about all the other creeds in the world, too.The reason I've taken this time is I've been fascinated to hear some of the reactions to this. One reviewer for a Roman Catholic newspaper called it \"totalitarian.\" It strikes me as practically libertarian. Is it totalitarian to require reading, writing and arithmetic? I don't think so. All I'm saying is \u2014 and facts, facts only; no values, just facts \u2014 about all the world's religions. Another reviewer called it \"hilarious.\" Well, I'm really bothered by the fact that anybody would think that was hilarious. It seems to me to be such a plausible, natural extension of the democratic principles we already have that I'm shocked to think anybody would find that just ridiculous. I know many religions are so anxious about preserving the purity of their faith among their children that they are intent on keeping their children ignorant of other faiths. I don't think that's defensible. But I'd really be pleased to get your answers on that \u2014 any reactions to that \u2014 later.But now I'm going to move on. Back to the cow. This picture, which I pulled off the web \u2014 the fellow on the left is really an important part of this picture. That's the steward. Cows couldn't live without human stewards \u2014 they're domesticated. They're a sort of ectosymbiont. They depend on us for their survival. And Pastor Rick was just talking about sheep. I'm going to talk about sheep, too. There's a lot of serendipitous convergence here. How clever it was of sheep to acquire shepherds!(Laughter)Think of what this got them. They could outsource all their problems: protection from predators, food-finding ...(Laughter)... health maintenance.(Laughter)The only cost in most flocks \u2014 not even this \u2014 a loss of free mating. What a deal! \"How clever of sheep!\" you might say. Except, of course, it wasn't the sheep's cleverness. We all know sheep are not exactly rocket scientists \u2014 they're not very smart. It wasn't the cleverness of the sheep at all. They were clueless. But it was a very clever move. Whose clever move was it? It was the clever move of natural selection itself.Francis Crick, the co-discoverer of the structure of DNA with Jim Watson, once joked about what he called Orgel's Second Rule. Leslie Orgel is a molecular biologist, brilliant guy, and Orgel's Second Rule is: Evolution is cleverer than you are. Now, that is not Intelligent Design \u2014 not from Francis Crick. Evolution is cleverer than you are. If you understand Orgel's Second Rule, then you understand why the Intelligent Design movement is basically a hoax.The designs discovered by the process of natural selection are brilliant, unbelievably brilliant. Again and again biologists are fascinated with the brilliance of what's discovered. But the process itself is without purpose, without foresight, without design. When I was here four years ago, I told the story about an ant climbing a blade of grass. And why the ant was doing it was because its brain had been infected with a lancet fluke that was needed to get into the belly of a sheep or a cow in order to reproduce. So it was sort of a spooky story.And I think some people may have misunderstood. Lancet flukes aren't smart. I submit that the intelligence of a lancet fluke is down there, somewhere between petunia and carrot. They're not really bright. They don't have to be. The lesson we learn from this is: you don't have to have a mind to be a beneficiary. The design is there in nature, but it's not in anybody's head. It doesn't have to be. That's the way evolution works. Question: Was domestication good for sheep? It was great for their genetic fitness.And here I want to remind you of a wonderful point that Paul MacCready made at TED three years ago. Here's what he said: \"Ten thousand years ago, at the dawn of agriculture, human population, plus livestock and pets, was approximately a tenth of one percent of the terrestrial vertebrate landmass.\" That was just 10,000 years ago. Yesterday, in biological terms. What is it today? Does anybody remember what he told us? 98 percent. That is what we have done on this planet.Now, I talked to Paul afterwards \u2014 I wanted to check to find out how he'd calculated this, and get the sources and so forth \u2014 and he also gave me a paper that he had written on this. And there was a passage in it which he did not present here and I think it is so good, I'm going to read it to you: \"Over billions of years on a unique sphere, chance has painted a thin covering of life: complex, improbable, wonderful and fragile. Suddenly, we humans \u2014 a recently arrived species no longer subject to the checks and balances inherent in nature \u2014 have grown in population, technology and intelligence to a position of terrible power. We now wield the paintbrush.\" We heard about the atmosphere as a thin layer of varnish. Life itself is just a thin coat of paint on this planet. And we're the ones that hold the paintbrush. And how can we do that?The key to our domination of the planet is culture. And the key to culture is religion. Suppose Martian scientists came to Earth. They would be puzzled by many things. Anybody know what this is? I'll tell you what it is. This is a million people gathering on the banks of the Ganges in 2001, perhaps the largest single gathering of human beings ever, as seen from satellite photograph. Here's a big crowd. Here's another crowd in Mecca. Martians would be amazed by this. They'd want to know how it originated, what it was for and how it perpetuates itself.Actually, I'm going to pass over this. The ant isn't alone. There's all sorts of wonderful cases of species which \u2014 in that case \u2014 A parasite gets into a mouse and needs to get into the belly of a cat. And it turns the mouse into Mighty Mouse, makes it fearless, so it runs out in the open, where it'll be eaten by a cat. True story. In other words, we have these hijackers \u2014 you've seen this slide before, from four years ago \u2014 a parasite that infects the brain and induces even suicidal behavior, on behalf of a cause other than one's own genetic fitness.Does that ever happen to us? Yes, it does \u2014 quite wonderfully. The Arabic word \"Islam\" means \"submission.\" It means \"surrender of self-interest to the will of Allah.\" But I'm not just talking about Islam. I'm talking also about Christianity. This is a parchment music page that I found in a Paris bookstall 50 years ago. And on it, it says, in Latin: \"Semen est verbum Dei. Sator autem Christus.\" The word of God is the seed and the sower of the seed is Christ. Same idea. Well, not quite. But in fact, Christians, too ... glory in the fact that they have surrendered to God. I'll give you a few quotes. \"The heart of worship is surrender. Surrendered people obey God's words, even if it doesn't make sense.\" Those words are by Rick Warren. Those are from \"The Purpose Driven Life.\"And I want to turn now, briefly, to talk about that book, which I've read. You've all got a copy, and you've just heard the man. And what I want to do now is say a bit about this book from the design standpoint, because I think it's actually a brilliant book. First of all, the goal \u2014 and you heard just now what the goal is \u2014 it's to bring purpose to the lives of millions, and he has succeeded. Is it a good goal? In itself, I'm sure we all agree, it is a wonderful goal. He's absolutely right. There are lots of people out there who don't have purpose in their life, and bringing purpose to their life is a wonderful goal. I give him an A+ on this.(Laughter)Is the goal achieved? Yes. Thirty million copies of this book. Al Gore, eat your heart out.(Laughter)Just exactly what Al is trying to do, Rick is doing. This is a fantastic achievement. And the means \u2014 how does he do it?It's a brilliant redesign of traditional religious themes \u2014 updating them, quietly dropping obsolete features, putting new interpretations on other features. This is the evolution of religion that's been going on for thousands of years, and he's just the latest brilliant practitioner of it. I don't have to tell you this; you just heard the man. Excellent insights into human psychology, wise advice on every page. Moreover, he invites us to look under the hood. I really appreciated that. For instance, he has an appendix where he explains his choice of translations of different Bible verses. The book is clear, vivid, accessible, beautifully formatted. Just enough repetition. That's really important. Every time you read it or say it, you make another copy in your brain. Every time you read it or say it, you make another copy in your brain.(Laughter)With me, everybody \u2014(Audience and Dan Dennett) Every time you read it or say it, you make another copy in your brain.Thank you.And now we come to my problem. Because I'm absolutely sincere in my appreciation of all that I said about this book. But I wish it were better. I have some problems with the book. And it would just be insincere of me not to address those problems. I wish he could do this with a revision, a Mark 2 version of his book. \"The truth will set you free.\" That's what it says in the Bible, and it's something that I want to live by, too.My problem is, some of the bits in it I don't think are true. Now some of this is a difference of opinion. And that's not my main complaint, that's worth mentioning. Here's a passage \u2014 it's very much what he said, anyway: \"If there was no God we would all be accidents, the result of astronomical random chance in the Universe. You could stop reading this book because life would have no purpose or meaning or significance. There would be no right or wrong and no hope beyond your brief years on Earth.\" Now, I just do not believe that. By the way, I find \u2014 Homer Groening's film presented a beautiful alternative to that very claim. Yes, there is meaning and a reason for right or wrong. We don't need a belief in God to be good or to have meaning in us. But that, as I said, is just a difference of opinion. That's not what I'm really worried about.How about this: \"God designed this planet's environment just so we could live in it.\" I'm afraid that a lot of people take that sentiment to mean that we don't have to do the sorts of things that Al Gore is trying so hard to get us to do. I am not happy with that sentiment at all. And then I find this: \"All the evidence available in the biological sciences supports the core proposition that the cosmos is a specially designed whole with life and mankind as its fundamental goal and purpose, a whole in which all facets of reality have their meaning and explanation in this central fact.\" Well, that's Michael Denton. He's a creationist. And here, I think, \"Wait a minute.\" I read this again. I read it three or four times and I think, \"Is he really endorsing Intelligent Design? Is he endorsing creationism here?\" And you can't tell. So I'm sort of thinking, \"Well, I don't know, I don't know if I want to get upset with this yet.\"But then I read on, and I read this: \"First, Noah had never seen rain, because prior to the Flood, God irrigated the earth from the ground up.\" I wish that sentence weren't in there, because I think it is false. And I think that thinking this way about the history of the planet, after we've just been hearing about the history of the planet over millions of years, discourages people from scientific understanding. Now, Rick Warren uses scientific terms and scientific factoids and information in a very interesting way.Here's one: \"God deliberately shaped and formed you to serve him in a way that makes your ministry unique. He carefully mixed the DNA cocktail that created you.\" I think that's false. Now, maybe we want to treat it as metaphorical. Here's another one: \"For instance, your brain can store 100 trillion facts. Your mind can handle 15,000 decisions a second.\" Well, it would be interesting to find the interpretation where I would accept that. There might be some way of treating that as true. \"Anthropologists have noted that worship is a universal urge, hardwired by God into the very fiber of our being \u2014 an inbuilt need to connect with God.\" Well, the sense of which I agree with him, except I think it has an evolutionary explanation.And what I find deeply troubling in this book is that he seems to be arguing that if you want to be moral, if you want to have meaning in your life, you have to be an Intelligent Designer, you have to deny the theory of evolution by natural selection. And I think, on the contrary, that it is very important to solving the world's problems that we take evolutionary biology seriously. Whose truth are we going to listen to? Well, this is from \"The Purpose Driven Life\": \"The Bible must become the authoritative standard for my life: the compass I rely on for direction, the counsel I listen to for making wise decisions, and the benchmark I use for evaluating everything.\" Well maybe, OK, but what's going to follow from this?And here's one that does concern me. Remember I quoted him before with this line: \"Surrendered people obey God's word, even if it doesn't make sense.\" And that's a problem.(Sighs)\"Don't ever argue with the Devil. He's better at arguing than you are, having had thousands of years to practice.\" Now, Rick Warren didn't invent this clever move. It's an old move. It's a very clever adaptation of religions. It's a wild card for disarming any reasonable criticism. \"You don't like my interpretation? You've got a reasonable objection to it? Don't listen, don't listen! That's the Devil speaking.\" This discourages the sort of reasoning citizenship it seems to me that we want to have.I've got one more problem, then I'm through. And I'd really like to get a response if Rick is able to do it. \"In the Great Commission, Jesus said, 'Go to all people of all nations and make them my disciples. Baptize them in the name of the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit, and teach them to do everything I've told you.'\" The Bible says Jesus is the only one who can save the world. We've seen many wonderful maps of the world in the last day or so. Here's one, not as beautiful as the others; it simply shows the religions of the world. Here's one that shows the sort of current breakdown of the different religions.Do we really want to commit ourselves to engulfing all the other religions, when their holy books are telling them, \"Don't listen to the other side, that's just Satan talking!\"? It seems to me that that's a very problematic ship to get on for the future. I found this sign as I was driving to Maine recently, in front of a church: \"Good without God becomes zero.\" Sort of cute. A very clever little meme. I don't believe it and I think this idea, popular as it is \u2014 not in this guise, but in general \u2014 is itself one of the main problems that we face.If you are like me, you know many wonderful, committed, engaged atheists, agnostics, who are being very good without God. And you also know many religious people who hide behind their sanctity instead of doing good works. So, I wish we could drop this meme. I wish this meme would go extinct.Thanks very much for your attention.(Applause)", "id": 94, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:13.981 -->

religions.\n\n00:02:38.548 --> 00:02:44.111\nNow that very idea, I think,\nstrikes terror in many people,\n\n00:02:44.135 --> 00:02:48.735\nor anger, or anxiety\nof one sort or another.\n\n00:02:49.701 --> 00:02:52.128\nAnd that is the spell\nthat I want to break.\n\n00:02:52.152 --> 00:02:55.867\nI want to say, no, religions\nare an important natural phenomenon.\n\n00:02:55.891 --> 00:02:59.139\nWe should study them\nwith the same intensity\n\n00:02:59.163 --> 00:03:02.330\nthat we study all the other\nimportant natural phenomena,\n\n00:03:02.354 --> 00:03:05.934\nlike global warming, as we heard\nso eloquently last night from Al Gore.\n\n00:03:07.086 --> 00:03:10.934\nToday's religions are brilliantly\ndesigned -- brilliantly designed.\n\n00:03:11.578 --> 00:03:15.911\nThey are immensely powerful\nsocial institutions\n\n00:03:15.935 --> 00:03:21.215\nand many of their features\ncan be traced back to earlier features\n\n00:03:21.239 --> 00:03:24.498\nthat we can really make sense of\nby reverse engineering.\n\n00:03:26.291 --> 00:03:31.663\nAnd, as with the cow, there's a mixture\nof evolutionary design --\n\n00:03:31.687 --> 00:03:33.656\ndesigned by natural selection itself --\n\n00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:36.787\nand intelligent design --\n\n00:03:36.811 --> 00:03:38.625\nmore or less intelligent design --\n\n00:03:38.649 --> 00:03:40.347\nand redesigned by human beings\n\n00:03:40.371 --> 00:03:43.251\nwho are trying\nto redesign their religions.\n\n00:03:44.522 --> 00:03:48.102\nYou don't do book talks at TED,\n\n00:03:48.126 --> 00:03:52.250\nbut I'm going to have\njust one slide about my book,\n\n00:03:52.274 --> 00:03:54.947\nbecause there is one message in it\n\n00:03:54.971 --> 00:03:57.135\nwhich I think this group\nreally needs to hear.\n\n00:03:57.159 --> 00:04:00.691\nAnd I would be very interested\nto get your responses to this.\n\n00:04:02.008 --> 00:04:06.653\nIt's the one policy proposal\nthat I make in the book,\n\n00:04:06.677 --> 00:04:10.040\nat this time, when I claim\nnot to know enough about religion\n\n00:04:10.064 --> 00:04:12.683\nto know what other\npolicy proposals to make.\n\n00:04:12.707 --> 00:04:17.255\nAnd it's one that echoes remarks\nthat you've heard already today.\n\n00:04:17.279 --> 00:04:18.438\nHere's my proposal,\n\n00:04:18.462 --> 00:04:21.392\nI'm going to just take a couple\nof minutes to explain it:\n\n00:04:21.416 --> 00:04:26.960\nEducation on world religions\nfor all of our children --\n\n00:04:26.984 --> 00:04:29.127\nin primary school, in high school,\n\n00:04:29.151 --> 00:04:32.416\nin public schools, in private schools\nand in home schooling.\n\n00:04:33.479 --> 00:04:35.137\nSo what I'm proposing is,\n\n00:04:35.161 --> 00:04:41.021\njust as we require reading, writing,\narithmetic, American history,\n\n00:04:41.045 --> 00:04:48.045\nso we should have a curriculum on facts\nabout all the religions of the world --\n\n00:04:48.069 --> 00:04:52.934\nabout their history,\nabout their creeds, about their texts,\n\n00:04:52.958 --> 00:04:57.619\ntheir music, their symbolisms,\ntheir prohibitions, their requirements.\n\n00:04:58.952 --> 00:05:03.771\nAnd this should be presented\nfactually, straightforwardly,\n\n00:05:03.795 --> 00:05:09.259\nwith no particular spin,\nto all of the children in the country.\n\n00:05:10.465 --> 00:05:13.758\nAnd as long as you teach them that,\n\n00:05:13.782 --> 00:05:15.934\nyou can teach them anything else you like.\n\n00:05:16.671 --> 00:05:20.663\nThat, I think, is maximal tolerance\nfor religious freedom.\n\n00:05:21.321 --> 00:05:25.934\nAs long as you inform your children\nabout other religions,\n\n00:05:25.958 --> 00:05:29.104\nthen you may -- and as early as you like\nand whatever you like --\n\n00:05:29.128 --> 00:05:32.327\nteach them whatever creed\nyou want them to learn.\n\n00:05:32.914 --> 00:05:35.550\nBut also let them know\nabout other religions.\n\n00:05:35.574 --> 00:05:37.958\nNow, why do I say that?\n\n00:05:39.323 --> 00:05:45.129\nBecause democracy depends\non an informed citizenship.\n\n00:05:46.208 --> 00:05:51.958\nInformed consent is the very bedrock\nof our understanding of democracy.\n\n00:05:53.888 --> 00:05:56.934\nMisinformed consent is not worth it.\n\n00:05:56.958 --> 00:06:00.181\nIt's like a coin flip;\nit doesn't count, really.\n\n00:06:00.205 --> 00:06:02.934\nDemocracy depends on informed consent.\n\n00:06:02.958 --> 00:06:08.291\nThis is the way we treat people\nas responsible adults.\n\n00:06:08.770 --> 00:06:15.508\nNow, children below the age of consent\nare a special case.\n\n00:06:17.566 --> 00:06:23.157\nParents -- I'm going to use a word\nthat Pastor Rick just used --\n\n00:06:23.181 --> 00:06:25.323\nparents are stewards of their children.\n\n00:06:26.117 --> 00:06:27.442\nThey don't own them.\n\n00:06:28.244 --> 00:06:30.146\nYou can't own your children.\n\n00:06:30.170 --> 00:06:33.853\nYou have a responsibility to the world,\n\n00:06:33.877 --> 00:06:37.618\nto the state, to them,\nto take care of them right.\n\n00:06:39.801 --> 00:06:45.848\nYou may teach them whatever creed\nyou think is most important,\n\n00:06:45.872 --> 00:06:50.698\nbut I say you have a responsibility\nto let them be informed\n\n00:06:50.722 --> 00:06:53.254\nabout all the other creeds\nin the world, too.\n\n00:06:53.958 --> 00:06:58.426\nThe reason I've taken this time\nis I've been fascinated to hear\n\n00:06:58.450 --> 00:06:59.958\nsome of the reactions to this.\n\n00:07:01.621 --> 00:07:06.737\nOne reviewer for a Roman Catholic\nnewspaper called it \"totalitarian.\"\n\n00:07:08.807 --> 00:07:11.958\nIt strikes me as practically libertarian.\n\n00:07:13.029 --> 00:07:16.052\nIs it totalitarian to require\nreading, writing and arithmetic?\n\n00:07:16.076 --> 00:07:17.235\nI don't think so.\n\n00:07:17.259 --> 00:07:19.238\nAll I'm saying is --\n\n00:07:19.262 --> 00:07:25.186\nand facts, facts only;\nno values, just facts --\n\n00:07:25.210 --> 00:07:26.958\nabout all the world's religions.\n\n00:07:28.641 --> 00:07:30.564\nAnother reviewer called it \"hilarious.\"\n\n00:07:31.858 --> 00:07:35.515\nWell, I'm really bothered by the fact\n\n00:07:35.539 --> 00:07:38.158\nthat anybody would think\nthat was hilarious.\n\n00:07:38.182 --> 00:07:42.163\nIt seems to me to be such a plausible,\n\n00:07:42.187 --> 00:07:46.583\nnatural extension of the democratic\nprinciples we already have\n\n00:07:46.607 --> 00:07:51.627\nthat I'm shocked to think anybody\nwould find that just ridiculous.\n\n00:07:51.960 --> 00:07:55.477\nI know many religions\n\n00:07:55.501 --> 00:08:02.138\nare so anxious about preserving the purity\nof their faith among their children\n\n00:08:02.162 --> 00:08:07.650\nthat they are intent on keeping\ntheir children ignorant of other faiths.\n\n00:08:09.103 --> 00:08:10.952\nI don't think that's defensible.\n\n00:08:12.142 --> 00:08:14.776\nBut I'd really be pleased\nto get your answers on that --\n\n00:08:14.800 --> 00:08:16.327\nany reactions to that -- later.\n\n00:08:16.351 --> 00:08:17.816\nBut now I'm going to move on.\n\n00:08:18.498 --> 00:08:19.934\nBack to the cow.\n\n00:08:19.958 --> 00:08:23.322\nThis picture, which I pulled\noff the web --\n\n00:08:23.346 --> 00:08:26.651\nthe fellow on the left is really\nan important part of this picture.\n\n00:08:26.675 --> 00:08:27.934\nThat's the steward.\n\n00:08:28.263 --> 00:08:33.772\nCows couldn't live without human\nstewards -- they're domesticated.\n\n00:08:33.796 --> 00:08:36.534\nThey're a sort of ectosymbiont.\n\n00:08:37.090 --> 00:08:41.732\nThey depend on us for their survival.\n\n00:08:42.338 --> 00:08:45.681\nAnd Pastor Rick\nwas just talking about sheep.\n\n00:08:45.705 --> 00:08:47.404\nI'm going to talk about sheep, too.\n\n00:08:47.428 --> 00:08:50.411\nThere's a lot of serendipitous\nconvergence here.\n\n00:08:50.965 --> 00:08:54.874\nHow clever it was of sheep\nto acquire shepherds!\n\n00:08:54.898 --> 00:08:57.231\n(Laughter)\n\n00:08:57.255 --> 00:08:59.040\nThink of what this got them.\n\n00:08:59.396 --> 00:09:01.934\nThey could outsource all their problems:\n\n00:09:01.958 --> 00:09:04.569\nprotection from predators,\nfood-finding ...\n\n00:09:04.593 --> 00:09:05.600\n(Laughter)\n\n00:09:05.624 --> 00:09:06.959\n... health maintenance.\n\n00:09:06.983 --> 00:09:08.876\n(Laughter)\n\n00:09:09.670 --> 00:09:14.458\nThe only cost in most flocks --\nnot even this -- a loss of free mating.\n\n00:09:16.623 --> 00:09:17.789\nWhat a deal!\n\n00:09:18.631 --> 00:09:20.507\n\"How clever of sheep!\" you might say.\n\n00:09:20.531 --> 00:09:23.032\nExcept, of course,\nit wasn't the sheep's cleverness.\n\n00:09:23.056 --> 00:09:27.445\nWe all know sheep are not exactly rocket\nscientists -- they're not very smart.\n\n00:09:28.385 --> 00:09:30.508\nIt wasn't the cleverness\nof the sheep at all.\n\n00:09:30.532 --> 00:09:31.934\nThey were clueless.\n\n00:09:33.159 --> 00:09:35.093\nBut it was a very clever move.\n\n00:09:35.117 --> 00:09:36.440\nWhose clever move was it?\n\n00:09:36.464 --> 00:09:39.934\nIt was the clever move\nof natural selection itself.\n\n00:09:40.776 --> 00:09:46.559\nFrancis Crick, the co-discoverer\nof the structure of DNA\n\n00:09:46.583 --> 00:09:48.346\nwith Jim Watson,\n\n00:09:48.370 --> 00:09:51.187\nonce joked about what he called\nOrgel's Second Rule.\n\n00:09:51.536 --> 00:09:56.787\nLeslie Orgel is a molecular\nbiologist, brilliant guy,\n\n00:09:56.811 --> 00:09:58.181\nand Orgel's Second Rule is:\n\n00:09:58.205 --> 00:09:59.982\nEvolution is cleverer than you are.\n\n00:10:01.918 --> 00:10:07.321\nNow, that is not Intelligent Design --\nnot from Francis Crick.\n\n00:10:08.437 --> 00:10:10.128\nEvolution is cleverer than you are.\n\n00:10:10.152 --> 00:10:13.286\nIf you understand Orgel's Second Rule,\nthen you understand\n\n00:10:13.310 --> 00:10:18.213\nwhy the Intelligent Design movement\nis basically a hoax.\n\n00:10:20.174 --> 00:10:24.588\nThe designs discovered\nby the process of natural selection\n\n00:10:24.612 --> 00:10:26.992\nare brilliant, unbelievably brilliant.\n\n00:10:27.016 --> 00:10:31.934\nAgain and again biologists are fascinated\nwith the brilliance of what's discovered.\n\n00:10:32.241 --> 00:10:35.406\nBut the process itself is without purpose,\n\n00:10:35.430 --> 00:10:37.605\nwithout foresight, without design.\n\n00:10:38.316 --> 00:10:39.847\nWhen I was here four years ago,\n\n00:10:39.871 --> 00:10:42.792\nI told the story about an ant\nclimbing a blade of grass.\n\n00:10:42.816 --> 00:10:46.682\nAnd why the ant was doing it\nwas because its brain had been infected\n\n00:10:46.706 --> 00:10:51.878\nwith a lancet fluke that was needed\nto get into the belly of a sheep or a cow\n\n00:10:51.902 --> 00:10:54.276\nin order to reproduce.\n\n00:10:54.300 --> 00:10:55.934\nSo it was sort of a spooky story.\n\n00:10:55.958 --> 00:10:58.704\nAnd I think some people\nmay have misunderstood.\n\n00:10:58.728 --> 00:11:00.332\nLancet flukes aren't smart.\n\n00:11:00.832 --> 00:11:05.066\nI submit that the intelligence\nof a lancet fluke is down there,\n\n00:11:05.090 --> 00:11:07.270\nsomewhere between petunia and carrot.\n\n00:11:07.294 --> 00:11:09.596\nThey're not really bright.\nThey don't have to be.\n\n00:11:09.620 --> 00:11:11.207\nThe lesson we learn from this is:\n\n00:11:11.231 --> 00:11:13.934\nyou don't have to have a mind\nto be a beneficiary.\n\n00:11:14.755 --> 00:11:19.247\nThe design is there in nature,\nbut it's not in anybody's head.\n\n00:11:19.708 --> 00:11:20.934\nIt doesn't have to be.\n\n00:11:20.958 --> 00:11:22.641\nThat's the way evolution works.\n\n00:11:23.593 --> 00:11:25.720\nQuestion: Was domestication\ngood for sheep?\n\n00:11:26.181 --> 00:11:28.228\nIt was great for their genetic fitness.\n\n00:11:28.252 --> 00:11:30.934\nAnd here I want to remind you\nof a wonderful point\n\n00:11:30.958 --> 00:11:33.934\nthat Paul MacCready made\nat TED three years ago.\n\n00:11:34.955 --> 00:11:36.113\nHere's what he said:\n\n00:11:36.970 --> 00:11:39.601\n\"Ten thousand years ago,\nat the dawn of agriculture,\n\n00:11:39.625 -->

In itself, I'm sure\nwe all agree, it is a wonderful goal.\n\n00:15:30.697 --> 00:15:31.848\nHe's absolutely right.\n\n00:15:31.872 --> 00:15:35.680\nThere are lots of people out there\nwho don't have purpose in their life,\n\n00:15:35.704 --> 00:15:38.514\nand bringing purpose to their life\nis a wonderful goal.\n\n00:15:38.538 --> 00:15:40.130\nI give him an A+ on this.\n\n00:15:40.154 --> 00:15:41.978\n(Laughter)\n\n00:15:42.002 --> 00:15:43.605\nIs the goal achieved?\n\n00:15:45.780 --> 00:15:46.934\nYes.\n\n00:15:48.224 --> 00:15:50.958\nThirty million copies of this book.\n\n00:15:52.477 --> 00:15:53.934\nAl Gore, eat your heart out.\n\n00:15:53.958 --> 00:15:57.615\n(Laughter)\n\n00:15:57.639 --> 00:16:01.260\nJust exactly what Al is trying\nto do, Rick is doing.\n\n00:16:01.284 --> 00:16:04.225\nThis is a fantastic achievement.\n\n00:16:04.986 --> 00:16:08.101\nAnd the means -- how does he do it?\n\n00:16:08.958 --> 00:16:11.934\nIt's a brilliant redesign\nof traditional religious themes --\n\n00:16:11.958 --> 00:16:15.259\nupdating them, quietly dropping\nobsolete features,\n\n00:16:15.283 --> 00:16:17.441\nputting new interpretations\non other features.\n\n00:16:17.465 --> 00:16:21.156\nThis is the evolution of religion that's\nbeen going on for thousands of years,\n\n00:16:21.180 --> 00:16:23.973\nand he's just the latest\nbrilliant practitioner of it.\n\n00:16:25.791 --> 00:16:28.347\nI don't have to tell you this;\nyou just heard the man.\n\n00:16:28.371 --> 00:16:32.934\nExcellent insights into human psychology,\nwise advice on every page.\n\n00:16:34.037 --> 00:16:37.365\nMoreover, he invites us\nto look under the hood.\n\n00:16:37.389 --> 00:16:38.738\nI really appreciated that.\n\n00:16:38.762 --> 00:16:41.206\nFor instance, he has an appendix\nwhere he explains\n\n00:16:41.230 --> 00:16:44.290\nhis choice of translations\nof different Bible verses.\n\n00:16:44.957 --> 00:16:49.958\nThe book is clear, vivid, accessible,\nbeautifully formatted.\n\n00:16:51.281 --> 00:16:52.934\nJust enough repetition.\n\n00:16:53.486 --> 00:16:54.772\nThat's really important.\n\n00:16:55.526 --> 00:16:59.218\nEvery time you read it or say it,\nyou make another copy in your brain.\n\n00:17:00.829 --> 00:17:04.574\nEvery time you read it or say it,\nyou make another copy in your brain.\n\n00:17:04.598 --> 00:17:05.606\n(Laughter)\n\n00:17:05.630 --> 00:17:06.874\nWith me, everybody --\n\n00:17:06.898 --> 00:17:09.874\n(Audience and Dan Dennett)\nEvery time you read it or say it,\n\n00:17:09.898 --> 00:17:12.199\nyou make another copy in your brain.\n\n00:17:12.223 --> 00:17:13.384\nThank you.\n\n00:17:13.408 --> 00:17:15.701\nAnd now we come to my problem.\n\n00:17:15.725 --> 00:17:18.934\nBecause I'm absolutely sincere\nin my appreciation\n\n00:17:18.958 --> 00:17:20.934\nof all that I said about this book.\n\n00:17:21.518 --> 00:17:23.176\nBut I wish it were better.\n\n00:17:23.200 --> 00:17:25.136\nI have some problems with the book.\n\n00:17:25.160 --> 00:17:28.939\nAnd it would just be insincere of me\nnot to address those problems.\n\n00:17:29.304 --> 00:17:33.067\nI wish he could do this with a revision,\n\n00:17:33.091 --> 00:17:35.522\na Mark 2 version of his book.\n\n00:17:37.558 --> 00:17:39.074\n\"The truth will set you free.\"\n\n00:17:39.494 --> 00:17:41.401\nThat's what it says in the Bible,\n\n00:17:41.425 --> 00:17:43.933\nand it's something\nthat I want to live by, too.\n\n00:17:44.376 --> 00:17:49.039\nMy problem is, some of the bits in it\nI don't think are true.\n\n00:17:49.706 --> 00:17:52.417\nNow some of this\nis a difference of opinion.\n\n00:17:54.131 --> 00:17:56.996\nAnd that's not my main complaint,\nthat's worth mentioning.\n\n00:17:57.020 --> 00:18:00.209\nHere's a passage -- it's very much\nwhat he said, anyway:\n\n00:18:00.233 --> 00:18:02.732\n\"If there was no God\nwe would all be accidents,\n\n00:18:02.756 --> 00:18:05.867\nthe result of astronomical\nrandom chance in the Universe.\n\n00:18:05.891 --> 00:18:09.269\nYou could stop reading this book\nbecause life would have no purpose\n\n00:18:09.293 --> 00:18:10.777\nor meaning or significance.\n\n00:18:10.801 --> 00:18:12.383\nThere would be no right or wrong\n\n00:18:12.407 --> 00:18:14.553\nand no hope beyond\nyour brief years on Earth.\"\n\n00:18:14.577 --> 00:18:16.486\nNow, I just do not believe that.\n\n00:18:16.510 --> 00:18:22.690\nBy the way, I find -- Homer Groening's\nfilm presented a beautiful alternative\n\n00:18:22.714 --> 00:18:24.055\nto that very claim.\n\n00:18:24.819 --> 00:18:28.224\nYes, there is meaning and a reason\nfor right or wrong.\n\n00:18:28.248 --> 00:18:34.482\nWe don't need a belief in God\nto be good or to have meaning in us.\n\n00:18:34.506 --> 00:18:38.767\nBut that, as I said,\nis just a difference of opinion.\n\n00:18:38.791 --> 00:18:40.934\nThat's not what I'm really worried about.\n\n00:18:41.608 --> 00:18:44.537\nHow about this: \"God designed\nthis planet's environment\n\n00:18:44.561 --> 00:18:46.068\njust so we could live in it.\"\n\n00:18:47.171 --> 00:18:51.613\nI'm afraid that a lot of people\ntake that sentiment to mean\n\n00:18:51.637 --> 00:18:54.257\nthat we don't have to do\nthe sorts of things\n\n00:18:54.281 --> 00:18:56.669\nthat Al Gore is trying so hard\nto get us to do.\n\n00:18:56.693 --> 00:18:58.934\nI am not happy with that sentiment at all.\n\n00:18:58.958 --> 00:19:03.530\nAnd then I find this: \"All the evidence\navailable in the biological sciences\n\n00:19:03.554 --> 00:19:07.238\nsupports the core proposition that\nthe cosmos is a specially designed whole\n\n00:19:07.262 --> 00:19:10.541\nwith life and mankind\nas its fundamental goal and purpose,\n\n00:19:10.565 --> 00:19:13.249\na whole in which all facets\nof reality have their meaning\n\n00:19:13.273 --> 00:19:15.290\nand explanation in this central fact.\"\n\n00:19:15.314 --> 00:19:17.573\nWell, that's Michael Denton.\nHe's a creationist.\n\n00:19:18.791 --> 00:19:21.934\nAnd here, I think, \"Wait a minute.\"\nI read this again.\n\n00:19:21.958 --> 00:19:23.997\nI read it three or four times and I think,\n\n00:19:24.021 --> 00:19:26.565\n\"Is he really endorsing\nIntelligent Design?\n\n00:19:26.589 --> 00:19:28.576\nIs he endorsing creationism here?\"\n\n00:19:28.600 --> 00:19:29.835\nAnd you can't tell.\n\n00:19:29.859 --> 00:19:31.964\nSo I'm sort of thinking,\n\"Well, I don't know,\n\n00:19:31.988 --> 00:19:34.385\nI don't know if I want\nto get upset with this yet.\"\n\n00:19:34.409 --> 00:19:38.493\nBut then I read on, and I read this:\n\"First, Noah had never seen rain,\n\n00:19:38.517 --> 00:19:42.374\nbecause prior to the Flood, God irrigated\nthe earth from the ground up.\"\n\n00:19:43.572 --> 00:19:47.934\nI wish that sentence weren't in there,\nbecause I think it is false.\n\n00:19:48.495 --> 00:19:51.662\nAnd I think that thinking this way\nabout the history of the planet,\n\n00:19:51.686 --> 00:19:55.409\nafter we've just been hearing\nabout the history of the planet\n\n00:19:55.433 --> 00:19:58.565\nover millions of years,\n\n00:19:58.589 --> 00:20:01.776\ndiscourages people\nfrom scientific understanding.\n\n00:20:01.800 --> 00:20:08.345\nNow, Rick Warren uses scientific terms\n\n00:20:08.369 --> 00:20:12.475\nand scientific factoids and information\nin a very interesting way.\n\n00:20:12.499 --> 00:20:15.863\nHere's one: \"God deliberately shaped\nand formed you to serve him\n\n00:20:15.887 --> 00:20:17.932\nin a way that makes your ministry unique.\n\n00:20:17.956 --> 00:20:21.599\nHe carefully mixed the DNA cocktail\nthat created you.\"\n\n00:20:24.766 --> 00:20:26.934\nI think that's false.\n\n00:20:26.958 --> 00:20:29.656\nNow, maybe we want to treat it\nas metaphorical.\n\n00:20:30.576 --> 00:20:34.155\nHere's another one: \"For instance,\nyour brain can store 100 trillion facts.\n\n00:20:34.179 --> 00:20:37.224\nYour mind can handle\n15,000 decisions a second.\"\n\n00:20:37.922 --> 00:20:40.596\nWell, it would be interesting\nto find the interpretation\n\n00:20:40.620 --> 00:20:42.001\nwhere I would accept that.\n\n00:20:42.025 --> 00:20:44.691\nThere might be some way\nof treating that as true.\n\n00:20:45.469 --> 00:20:48.777\n\"Anthropologists have noted\nthat worship is a universal urge,\n\n00:20:48.801 --> 00:20:51.456\nhardwired by God into\nthe very fiber of our being --\n\n00:20:51.480 --> 00:20:54.369\nan inbuilt need to connect with God.\"\n\n00:20:55.350 --> 00:20:57.518\nWell, the sense of which I agree with him,\n\n00:20:57.542 --> 00:20:59.922\nexcept I think it has\nan evolutionary explanation.\n\n00:20:59.946 --> 00:21:03.767\nAnd what I find\ndeeply troubling in this book\n\n00:21:03.791 --> 00:21:07.544\nis that he seems to be arguing\nthat if you want to be moral,\n\n00:21:07.568 --> 00:21:09.737\nif you want to have meaning in your life,\n\n00:21:09.761 --> 00:21:12.228\nyou have to be an Intelligent Designer,\n\n00:21:12.252 --> 00:21:15.773\nyou have to deny the theory of evolution\nby natural selection.\n\n00:21:15.797 --> 00:21:17.276\nAnd I think, on the contrary,\n\n00:21:17.300 --> 00:21:20.241\nthat it is very important\nto solving the world's problems\n\n00:21:20.265 --> 00:21:23.125\nthat we take evolutionary\nbiology seriously.\n\n00:21:24.385 --> 00:21:26.296\nWhose truth are we going to listen

about the book?\" And I say, \"That I got to write it.\" I would have never imagined that. Not in my wildest dreams did I think \u2014 I don't even consider myself to be an author. And I'm often asked, \"Why do you think so many people have read this? This thing's selling still about a million copies a month.\"And I think it's because spiritual emptiness is a universal disease. I think inside at some point, we put our heads down on the pillow and we go, \"There's got to be more to life than this.\" Get up in the morning, go to work, come home and watch TV, go to bed, get up in the morning, go to work, come home, watch TV, go to bed, go to parties on weekends. A lot of people say, \"I'm living.\" No, you're not living \u2014 that's just existing. Just existing. I really think that there's this inner desire. I do believe what Chris said; I believe that you're not an accident. Your parents may not have planned you, but I believe God did. I think there are accidental parents; there's no doubt about that. I don't think there are accidental kids. And I think you matter.I think you matter to God; I think you matter to history; I think you matter to this universe. And I think that the difference between what I call the survival level of living, the success level of living, and the significance level of living is: Do you figure out, \"What on Earth am I here for?\" I meet a lot of people who are very smart, and say, \"But why can't I figure out my problems?\" And I meet a lot of people who are very successful, who say, \"Why don't I feel more fulfilled? Why do I feel like a fake? Why do I feel like I've got to pretend that I'm more than I really am?\" I think that comes down to this issue of meaning, of significance, of purpose. I think it comes down to this issue of: \"Why am I here? What am I here for? Where am I going?\" These are not religious issues. They're human issues.I wanted to tell Michael before he spoke that I really appreciate what he does, because it makes my life work a whole lot easier. As a pastor, I do see a lot of kooks. And I have learned that there are kooks in every area of life. Religion doesn't have a monopoly on that, but there are plenty of religious kooks. There are secular kooks; there are smart kooks, dumb kooks. There are people \u2014 a lady came up to me the other day, and she had a white piece of paper \u2014 Michael, you'll like this one \u2014 and she said, \"What do you see in it?\" And I looked at it and I said, \"Oh, I don't see anything.\" And she goes, \"Well, I see Jesus,\" and started crying and left. I'm going, \"OK,\" you know? \"Fine.\"(Laughter)Good for you.When the book became the best-selling book in the world for the last three years, I kind of had my little crisis. And that was: What is the purpose of this? Because it brought in enormous amounts of money. When you write the best-selling book in the world, it's tons and tons of money. And it brought in a lot of attention, neither of which I wanted. When I started Saddleback Church, I was 25 years old. I started it with one other family in 1980. And I decided that I was never going to go on TV, because I didn't want to be a celebrity. I didn't want to be a, quote, \"evangelist, televangelist\" \u2014 that's not my thing. And all of the sudden, it brought a lot of money and a lot of attention. I don't think \u2014 now, this is a worldview, and I will tell you, everybody's got a worldview.Everybody's betting their life on something. You're betting your life on something, you just better know why you're betting what you're betting on. So, everybody's betting their life on something. And when I, you know, made a bet, I happened to believe that Jesus was who he said he was. And I believe in a pluralistic society, everybody's betting on something. And when I started the church, you know, I had no plans to do what it's doing now. And then when I wrote this book, and all of a sudden, it just took off, and I started saying, now, what's the purpose of this? Because as I started to say, I don't think you're given money or fame for your own ego, ever. I just don't believe that. And when you write a book that the first sentence of the book is, \"It's not about you,\" then, when all of a sudden it becomes the best-selling book in history, you've got to figure, well, I guess it's not about me. That's kind of a no-brainer. So, what is it for?And I began to think about what I call the \"stewardship of affluence\" and the \"stewardship of influence.\" So I believe, essentially, leadership is stewardship. That if you are a leader in any area \u2014 in business, in politics, in sports, in art, in academics, in any area \u2014 you don't own it. You are a steward of it. For instance, that's why I believe in protecting the environment. This is not my planet. It wasn't mine before I was born, it's not going to be mine after I die, I'm just here for 80 years and then that's it.I was debating the other day on a talk show, and the guy was challenging me and he'd go, \"What's a pastor doing on protecting the environment?\" And I asked this guy, I said, \"Well, do you believe that human beings are responsible to make the world a little bit better place for the next generation? Do you think we have a stewardship here, to take the environment seriously?\" And he said, \"No.\" I said, \"Oh, you don't?\" I said, \"Let me make this clear again: Do you believe that as human beings \u2014 I'm not talking about religion \u2014 do you believe that as human beings, it is our responsibility to take care of this planet, and make it just a little bit better for the next generation?\" And he said, \"No. Not any more than any other species.\" When he said the word \"species,\" he was revealing his worldview. And he was saying, \"I'm no more responsible to take care of this environment than a duck is.\" Well now, I know a lot of times we act like ducks, but you're not a duck. You're not a duck. And you are responsible \u2014 that's my worldview. And so, you need to understand what your worldview is.The problem is most people never really think it through. They never really ... codify it or qualify it or quantify it, and say, \"This is what I believe in. This is why I believe what I believe.\" I don't personally have enough faith to be an atheist. But you may, you may. Your worldview, though, does determine everything else in your life, because it determines your decisions; it determines your relationships; it determines your level of confidence. It determines, really, everything in your life. What we believe, obviously \u2014 and you know this \u2014 determines our behavior, and our behavior determines what we become in life.So all of this money started pouring in, and all of this fame started pouring in. And I'm going, what do I do with this? My wife and I first made five decisions on what to do with the money. We said, \"First, we're not going to use it on ourselves.\" I didn't go out and buy a bigger house. I don't own a guesthouse. I still drive the same four year-old Ford that I've driven. We just said, we're not going to use it on us. The second thing was, I stopped taking a salary from the church that I pastor. Third thing is, I added up all that the church had paid me over the last 25 years, and I gave it back. And I gave it back because I didn't want anybody thinking that I do what I do for money \u2014 I don't. In fact, personally, I've never met a priest or a pastor or a minister who does it for money. I know that's the stereotype; I've never met one of them. Believe me, there's a whole lot easier ways to make money.Pastors are like on 24 hours-a-day call, they're like doctors. I left late today \u2014 I'd hoped to be here yesterday \u2014 because my father-in-law is in his last, probably, 48 hours before he dies of cancer. And I'm watching a guy who's lived his life \u2014 he's now in his mid-80s \u2014 and he's dying with peace. You know, the test of your worldview is not how you act in the good times. The test of your worldview is how you act at the funeral. And having been through literally hundreds if not thousands of funerals, it makes a difference. It makes a difference what you believe.So, we gave it all back, and then we set up three foundations, working on some of the major problems of the world: illiteracy, poverty, pandemic diseases \u2014 particularly HIV/AIDS \u2014 and set up these three foundations, and put the money into that. The last thing we did is we became what I call \"reverse tithers.\" And that is, when my wife and I got married 30 years ago, we started tithing. Now, that's a principle in the Bible that says give 10 percent of what you get back to charity, give it away to help other people. So, we started doing that, and each year we would raise our tithe one percent. So, our first year of marriage we went to 11 percent, second year we went to 12 percent, and the third year we went to 13 percent, and on and on and on. Why did I do that? Because every time I give, it breaks the grip of materialism in my life.Materialism is all about getting \u2014 get, get, get, get all you can, can all you get, sit on the can and spoil the rest. It's all about more, having more. And we think that the good life is actually looking good \u2014 that's most important of all \u2014 looking good, feeling good and having the goods. But that's not the good life. I meet people all the time who have those, and they're not necessarily happy. If money actually made you happy, then the wealthiest people in the world would be the happiest. And that I know, personally, I know, is not true. It's just not true.So, the good life is not about looking good, feeling good or having the goods, it's about being good and doing good. Giving your life away. Significance in life doesn't come from status, because you can always find somebody who's got more than you. It doesn't come from sex. It doesn't come from salary. It comes from serving. It is in giving our lives away that we find meaning, we find significance. That's the way we were wired, I believe, by God. And so we began to give away, and now after 30 years, my wife and I are reverse tithers \u2014 we give away 90 percent and live on 10. That, actually, was the easy part. The hard part is, what do I do with all this attention? Because I started getting all kinds of invitations. I just came off a nearly month-long speaking tour on three different continents, and I won't go into that, but it was an amazing thing. And I'm going, what do I do with this notoriety that the book has brought?And, being a pastor, I started reading the Bible. There's a chapter in the Bible called Psalm 72, and it's Solomon's prayer for more influence. When you read this prayer, it sounds incredibly selfish, self-centered. He says, \"God, I want you to make me famous.\" That's what he prays. He said, \"I want you to make me famous. I want you to spread the fame of my name through every land, I want you to give me power. I want you to make me famous, I want you to give me influence.\" And it just sounds like the most egotistical request you could make, if you were going to pray. Until you read the whole psalm, the whole chapter. And then he says, \"So that the king ...\" \u2014 he was the king of Israel at that time, at its apex in power \u2014 \"... so that the king may care for the widow and orphan, support the oppressed, defend the defenseless, care for the sick, assist the poor, speak up for the foreigner, those in prison.\" Basically, he's talking about all the marginalized in society.And as I read that, I looked at it, and I thought, you know, what this is saying is that the purpose of influence is to speak up for those who have no influence. The purpose of influence is not to build your ego. Or your net worth. And, by the way, your net worth is not the same thing as your self-worth. Your value is not based on your valuables. It's based on a whole different set of things. And so the purpose of influence is to speak up for those who have no influence. And I had to admit: I can't think of the last time I thought of widows and orphans. They're not on my radar. I pastor a church in one of the most affluent areas of America \u2014 a bunch of gated communities. I have a church full of CEOs and scientists. And I could go five years and never, ever see a homeless person. They're just not in my pathway. Now, they're 13 miles up the road in Santa Ana. So I had to say, ok, I would use whatever affluence and whatever influence I've got to help those who don't have either of those.You know, there's a story in the Bible about Moses, whether you believe it's true or not, it really doesn't matter to me. But Moses, if you saw the movie, \"The Ten Commandments,\" Moses goes out, and there's this burning bush, and God talks to him, and God says, \"Moses, what's in your hand?\" I think that's one of the most important questions you'll ever be asked: What's in your hand? Moses says, \"It's a staff. It's a shepherd's staff.\" And God says, \"Throw it down.\" And if you saw the movie, you know, he throws it down and it becomes a snake. And then God says, \"Pick it up.\" And he picks it back up again, and it becomes a staff again. Now, I'm reading this thing, and I'm going, what is that all about? OK. What's that all about? Well, I do know a couple of things. Number one, God never does a miracle to show off. It's not just, \"Wow, isn't that cool?\" And, by the way, my God doesn't have to show up on cheese bread. You know, if God's going to show up, he's not going to show up on cheese bread.(Laughter)Ok? I just, this is why I love what Michael does, because it's like, if he's debunking it, then I don't have to. But God \u2014 my God \u2014 doesn't show up on sprinkler images. He's got a few more powerful ways than that to do whatever he wants to do. But he doesn't do miracles just to show off.Second thing is, if God ever asks you a question, he already knows the answer. Obviously, if he's God, then that would mean that when he asks the question, it's for your benefit, not his. So he's going, \"What's in your hand?\" Now, what was in Moses' hand? Well, it was a shepherd's staff. Now, follow me on this.This staff represented three things about Moses' life. First, it represented his identity; he was a shepherd. It's the symbol of his own occupation: I am a shepherd. It's a symbol of his identity, his career, his job. Second, it's a symbol of not only his identity, it's a symbol of his income, because all of his assets are tied up in sheep. In those days, nobody had bank accounts, or American Express cards, or hedge funds. Your assets are tied up in your flocks. So it's a symbol of his identity, and it's a symbol of his income. And the third thing: it's a symbol of his influence. What do you do with a shepherd's staff? Well, you know, you move sheep from point A to point B with it, by hook or by crook. You pull them or you poke them. One or the other. So, he's saying, \"You're going to lay down your identity. What's in your hand? You've got identity, you've got income, you've got influence. What's in your hand?\" And he's saying, \"If you lay it down, I'll make it come alive. I'll do some things you could never imagine possible.\" And if you've watched that movie, \"Ten Commandments,\" all of those big miracles that happen in Egypt are done through this staff.Last year, I was invited to speak at the NBA All-Stars game. And so, I'm talking to the players, because most of the NBA teams, NFL teams and all the other teams have done this 40 Days of Purpose, based on the book. And I asked them, I said, \"What's in your hand? So, what's in your hand?\" I said, \"It's a basketball. And that basketball represents your identity, who you are: you're an NBA player. It represents your income: you're making a lot of money off that little ball. And it represents your influence. And even though you're only going to be in the NBA for a few years, you're going to be an NBA player for the rest of your life. And that gives you enormous influence. So, what are you going to do with what you've been given?\"And I guess that's the main reason I came up here today, to all of you very bright people at TED \u2014 it is to say, \"What's in your hand?\" What do you have that you've been given? Talent, background, education, freedom, networks, opportunities, wealth, ideas, creativity. What are you doing with what you've been given? That, to me, is the primary question about life. That, to me, is what being purpose-driven is all about. In the book, I talk about how you're wired to do certain things, you're \"SHAPED\" with \u2014 a little acrostic: Spiritual gifts, Heart, Ability, Personality and Experiences. These things shape you. And if you want to know what you ought to be doing with your life, you need to look at your shape \u2014 \"What am I wired to do?\" Why would God wire you to do something and then not have you do it? If you're wired to be an anthropologist, you'll be an anthropologist. If you're wired to be an undersea explorer, you'll be an undersea explorer. If you're wired to make deals, you make deals. If you're wired to paint, you paint.Did you know that God smiles when you be you? When my little kids \u2014 when my kids were little \u2014 they're all grown now, I have grandkids \u2014 I used to go in and sit on the side of their bed, and I used to watch my kids sleep. And I just watched their little bodies rise and lower, rise and lower. And I would look at them: \"This is not an accident.\" Rise and lower. And I got joy out of just watching them sleep. Some people have the misguided idea that God only gets excited when you're doing, quote, \"spiritual things,\" like going to church or helping the poor, or, you know, confessing or doing something like that. The bottom line is, God gets pleasure watching you be you. Why? He made you. And when you do what you were made to do, he goes, \"That's my boy! That's my girl! You're using the talent and ability that I gave you.\"So my advice to you is: look at what's in your hand \u2014 your identity, your influence, your income \u2014 and say, \"It's not about me. It's about making the world a better place.\"Thank you.", "id": 71, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:13.354 --> 00:00:15.782\nI'm often asked,\n\n00:00:15.806 --> 00:00:18.254\n\"What surprised you about the book?\"\n\n00:00:18.278 --> 00:00:20.435\nAnd I say, \"That I got to write it.\"\n\n00:00:20.459 --> 00:00:22.613\nI would have never imagined that.\n\n00:00:23.288 --> 00:00:25.838\nNot in my wildest dreams did I think --\n\n00:00:25.862 --> 00:00:28.140\nI don't even consider\nmyself to be an author.\n\n00:00:29.247 --> 00:00:31.445\nAnd I'm often asked,\n\n00:00:31.469 --> 00:00:33.934\n\"Why do you think so many\npeople have read this?\n\n00:00:33.958 --> 00:00:37.184\nThis thing's selling still\nabout a million copies a month.\"\n\n00:00:38.958 --> 00:00:43.934\nAnd I think it's because\nspiritual emptiness\n\n00:00:43.958 --> 00:00:46.846\nis a universal disease.\n\n00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:50.487\nI think inside at some point, we put\nour heads down on the pillow and we go,\n\n00:00:50.511 --> 00:00:52.650\n\"There's got to be more\nto life than this.\"\n\n00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:55.891\nGet up in the morning, go to work,\ncome home and watch TV,\n\n00:00:55.915 --> 00:00:59.575\ngo to bed, get up in the morning, go\nto work, come home, watch TV, go to bed,\n\n00:00:59.599 --> 00:01:00.958\ngo to parties on weekends.\n\n00:01:02.241 --> 00:01:06.928\nA lot of people say, \"I'm living.\" No,\nyou're not living -- that's just existing.\n\n00:01:06.952 --> 00:01:08.471\nJust existing.\n\n00:01:08.495 --> 00:01:11.527\nI really think that\nthere's this inner desire.\n\n00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:16.226\nI do believe what Chris said;\nI believe that you're not an accident.\n\n00:01:17.686 --> 00:01:21.136\nYour parents may not have planned you,\nbut I believe God did.\n\n00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:24.391\nI think there are accidental parents;\nthere's no doubt about that.\n\n00:01:24.415 --> 00:01:26.490\nI don't think there are accidental kids.\n\n00:01:27.656 --> 00:01:29.399\nAnd I think you matter.\n\n00:01:30.494 --> 00:01:33.511\nI think you matter to God;\nI think you matter to history;\n\n00:01:33.535 --> 00:01:35.502\nI think you matter to this universe.\n\n00:01:36.907 --> 00:01:39.130\nAnd I think that the difference\n\n00:01:39.154 --> 00:01:43.934\nbetween what I call the survival level\nof living, the success level of living,\n\n00:01:43.958 --> 00:01:45.934\nand the significance level of living is:\n\n00:01:45.958 --> 00:01:48.640\nDo you figure out,\n\"What on Earth am I here for?\"\n\n00:01:49.482 --> 00:01:52.852\nI meet a lot of people who are very smart,\n\n00:01:52.876 --> 00:01:55.339\nand say, \"But why can't I\nfigure out my problems?\"\n\n00:01:55.958 --> 00:01:58.599\nAnd I meet a lot of people\nwho are very successful,\n\n00:01:58.623 --> 00:02:00.638\nwho say, \"Why don't I feel more fulfilled?\n\n00:02:01.337 --> 00:02:02.979\nWhy do I feel like a fake?\n\n00:02:03.958 --> 00:02:09.695\nWhy do I feel like I've got to pretend\nthat I'm more than I really am?\"\n\n00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:14.266\nI think that comes down to this issue\nof meaning, of significance, of purpose.\n\n00:02:14.854 --> 00:02:17.309\nI think it comes down to this issue of:\n\n00:02:17.333 --> 00:02:20.872\n\"Why am I here? What am I here for?\nWhere am I going?\"\n\n00:02:20.896 --> 00:02:23.072\nThese are not religious issues.\n\n00:02:23.737 --> 00:02:26.070\nThey're human issues.\n\n00:02:26.958 --> 00:02:30.934\nI wanted to tell Michael before he spoke\nthat I really appreciate what he does,\n\n00:02:30.958 --> 00:02:34.108\nbecause it makes my life work\na whole lot easier.\n\n00:02:34.132 --> 00:02:37.934\nAs a pastor, I do see a lot of kooks.\n\n00:02:38.354 --> 00:02:41.759\nAnd I have learned that there are\nkooks in every area of life.\n\n00:02:42.402 --> 00:02:46.730\nReligion doesn't have a monopoly on that,\n\n00:02:46.754 --> 00:02:48.791\nbut there are plenty of religious kooks.\n\n00:02:48.815 --> 00:02:52.202\nThere are secular kooks;\nthere are smart kooks, dumb kooks.\n\n00:02:52.226 --> 00:02:54.837\nThere are people -- a lady\ncame up to me the other day,\n\n00:02:54.861 --> 00:02:58.176\nand she had a white piece of paper --\nMichael, you'll like this one --\n\n00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:00.026\nand she said, \"What do you see in it?\"\n\n00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:02.790\nAnd I looked at it and I said,\n\"Oh, I don't see anything.\"\n\n00:03:02.814 --> 00:03:05.786\nAnd she goes, \"Well, I see Jesus,\"\nand started crying and left.\n\n00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:10.314\nI'm going, \"OK,\" you know? \"Fine.\"\n\n00:03:10.338 --> 00:03:12.498\n(Laughter)\n\n00:03:12.522 --> 00:03:13.672\nGood for you.\n\n00:03:16.408 --> 00:03:20.289\nWhen the book became the best-selling book\nin the world for the last three years,\n\n00:03:20.313 --> 00:03:22.468\nI kind of had my little crisis.\n\n00:03:23.344 --> 00:03:25.958\nAnd that was: What is the purpose of this?\n\n00:03:27.729 --> 00:03:30.514\nBecause it brought in\nenormous amounts of money.\n\n00:03:30.538 --> 00:03:32.959\nWhen you write the best-selling\nbook in the world,\n\n00:03:32.983 --> 00:03:34.725\nit's tons and tons of money.\n\n00:03:35.852 --> 00:03:39.127\nAnd it brought in a lot of attention,\nneither of which I wanted.\n\n00:03:39.151 --> 00:03:42.146\nWhen I started Saddleback Church,\nI was 25 years old.\n\n00:03:42.567 --> 00:03:46.973\nI started it with\none other family in 1980.\n\n00:03:47.632 --> 00:03:49.934\nAnd I decided that I was never\ngoing to go on TV,\n\n00:03:49.958 --> 00:03:51.880\nbecause I didn't want to be a celebrity.\n\n00:03:51.904 --> 00:03:55.085\nI didn't want to be a, quote,\n\"evangelist, televangelist\" --\n\n00:03:55.109 --> 00:03:56.958\nthat's not my thing.\n\n00:03:57.854 --> 00:04:02.128\nAnd all of the sudden, it brought a lot\nof money and a lot of attention.\n\n00:04:02.152 --> 00:04:03.692\nI don't think --\n\n00:04:03.716 --> 00:04:04.957\nnow, this is a worldview,\n\n00:04:04.981 --> 00:04:07.431\nand I will tell you,\neverybody's got a worldview.\n\n00:04:07.995 --> 00:04:10.054\nEverybody's betting\ntheir life on something.\n\n00:04:10.078 --> 00:04:11.915\nYou're betting your life on something,\n\n00:04:11.939 --> 00:04:15.343\nyou just better know why\nyou're betting what you're betting on.\n\n00:04:15.367 --> 00:04:17.648\nSo, everybody's betting\ntheir life on something.\n\n00:04:18.616 --> 00:04:22.578\nAnd when I, you know, made a bet,\n\n00:04:22.602 --> 00:04:25.514\nI happened to believe\nthat Jesus was who he said he was.\n\n00:04:26.117 --> 00:04:29.076\nAnd I believe in a pluralistic society,\n\n00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:31.037\neverybody's betting on something.\n\n00:04:32.362 --> 00:04:35.460\nAnd when I started the church,\n\n00:04:35.484 --> 00:04:39.050\nyou know, I had no plans\nto do what it's doing now.\n\n00:04:40.129 --> 00:04:41.986\nAnd then when I wrote this book,\n\n00:04:42.010 --> 00:04:46.535\nand all of a sudden, it just took off,\n\n00:04:46.559 --> 00:04:49.146\nand I started saying, now,\nwhat's the purpose of this?\n\n00:04:49.170 --> 00:04:50.891\nBecause as I started to say,\n\n00:04:50.915 --> 00:04:53.111\nI don't think you're given money or fame\n\n00:04:53.135 --> 00:04:54.715\nfor your own ego, ever.\n\n00:04:56.469 --> 00:04:57.746\nI just don't believe that.\n\n00:04:58.329 --> 00:05:01.516\nAnd when you write a book\nthat the first sentence of the book is,\n\n00:05:01.540 --> 00:05:03.962\n\"It's not about you,\"\n\n00:05:03.986 --> 00:05:07.366\nthen, when all of a sudden it becomes\nthe best-selling book in history,\n\n00:05:07.390 --> 00:05:09.953\nyou've got to figure, well,\nI guess it's not about me.\n\n00:05:10.622 --> 00:05:12.265\nThat's kind of a no-brainer.\n\n00:05:13.209 --> 00:05:14.825\nSo, what is it for?\n\n00:05:15.701 --> 00:05:19.307\nAnd I began to think about what I call\nthe \"stewardship of affluence\"\n\n00:05:19.331 --> 00:05:21.934\nand the \"stewardship of influence.\"\n\n00:05:22.392 --> 00:05:25.062\nSo I believe, essentially,\nleadership is stewardship.\n\n00:05:25.958 --> 00:05:28.383\nThat if you are a leader in any area --\n\n00:05:28.407 --> 00:05:31.923\nin business, in politics,\nin sports, in art,\n\n00:05:31.947 --> 00:05:34.015\nin academics, in any area --\n\n00:05:34.039 --> 00:05:35.341\nyou don't own it.\n\n00:05:36.722 --> 00:05:38.237\nYou are a steward of it.\n\n00:05:38.867 --> 00:05:41.938\nFor instance, that's why I believe\nin protecting the environment.\n\n00:05:41.962 --> 00:05:43.522\nThis is not my planet.\n\n00:05:43.546 --> 00:05:47.009\nIt wasn't mine before I was born,\nit's not going to be mine after I die,\n\n00:05:47.033 --> 00:05:50.204\nI'm just here for 80 years\nand then that's it.\n\n00:05:50.228 --> 00:05:54.325\nI was debating\nthe other day on a talk show,\n\n00:05:54.349 --> 00:05:56.362\nand the guy was challenging\nme and he'd go,\n\n00:05:56.386 --> 00:05:58.958\n\"What's a pastor doing\non protecting the environment?\"\n\n00:05:59.814 --> 00:06:03.591\nAnd I asked this guy, I said,\n\"Well, do you believe\n\n00:06:03.615 --> 00:06:07.498\nthat human beings are responsible\n\n00:06:07.522 --> 00:06:11.283\nto make the world a little bit better\nplace for the next generation?\n\n00:06:11.307 --> 00:06:15.538\nDo you think we have a stewardship here,\nto take the environment seriously?\"\n\n00:06:16.292 --> 00:06:17.570\nAnd he said, \"No.\"\n\n00:06:18.243 --> 00:06:19.397\nI said, \"Oh, you don't?\"\n\n00:06:19.421 --> 00:06:21.246\nI said, \"Let me make this clear again:\n\n00:06:21.270 --> 00:06:25.216\nDo you believe that as human beings --\nI'm not talking about religion --\n\n00:06:25.240 --> 00:06:28.112\ndo you believe that as human beings,\nit is our responsibility\n\n00:06:28.136 --> 00:06:29.478\nto take care of this planet,\n\n00:06:29.502 --> 00:06:32.425\nand make it just a little bit better\nfor the next generation?\"\n\n00:06:32.449 --> 00:06:35.958\nAnd he said, \"No. Not any more\nthan any other species.\"\n\n00:06:37.158 --> 00:06:40.745\nWhen he said the word \"species,\"\nhe was revealing his worldview.\n\n00:06:41.340 --> 00:06:42.534\nAnd he was saying,\n\n00:06:42.558 --> 00:06:46.573\n\"I'm no more responsible to take care\nof this environment than a duck is.\"\n\n00:06:47.845 --> 00:06:50.435\nWell now, I know a lot\nof times we act like ducks,\n\n00:06:50.459 --> 00:06:51.657\nbut you're not a duck.\n\n00:06:52.593 --> 00:06:53.763\nYou're not a duck.\n\n00:06:54.501 --> 00:06:57.379\nAnd you are responsible --\nthat's my worldview.\n\n00:06:58.355 --> 00:07:02.630\nAnd so, you need to understand\nwhat your worldview is.\n\n00:07:02.654 --> 00:07:06.154\nThe problem is most people\nnever really think it through.\n\n00:07:06.741 --> 00:07:10.680\nThey never really ...\n\n00:07:10.704 --> 00:07:14.037\ncodify it or qualify it or quantify it,\n\n00:07:14.061 --> 00:07:18.143\nand say, \"This is what I believe in.\nThis is why I believe what I believe.\"\n\n00:07:18.167 --> 00:07:21.165\nI don't personally have\nenough faith to be an atheist.\n\n00:07:22.117 --> 00:07:24.443\nBut you may, you may.\n\n00:07:24.958 --> 00:07:29.047\nYour worldview, though, does determine\neverything else in your life,\n\n00:07:29.071 --> 00:07:31.793\nbecause it determines your decisions;\n\n00:07:31.817 --> 00:07:34.206\nit determines your relationships;\n\n00:07:34.230 --> 00:07:36.469\nit determines your level of confidence.\n\n00:07:37.040 --> 00:07:39.715\nIt determines, really,\neverything in your life.\n\n00:07:40.235 --> 00:07:42.012\nWhat we believe, obviously --\n\n00:07:42.036 --> 00:07:44.743\nand you know this --\ndetermines our behavior,\n\n00:07:44.767 --> 00:07:48.529\nand our behavior determines\nwhat we become in life.\n\n00:07:50.870 --> 00:07:52.934\nSo all of this money started pouring in,\n\n00:07:52.958 --> 00:07:55.902\nand all of this fame started pouring in.\n\n00:07:56.958 --> 00:07:58.958\nAnd I'm going, what do I do with this?\n\n00:08:00.497 --> 00:08:03.958\nMy wife and I first made five decisions\non what to do with the money.\n\n00:08:05.039 --> 00:08:09.035\nWe said, \"First, we're not\ngoing to use it on ourselves.\"\n\n00:08:09.708 --> 00:08:11.712\nI didn't go out and buy a bigger house.\n\n00:08:12.057 --> 00:08:13.832\nI don't own a guesthouse.\n\n00:08:13.856 --> 00:08:16.958\nI still drive the same four year-old\nFord that I've driven.\n\n00:08:17.577 --> 00:08:19.760\nWe just said, we're not\ngoing to use it on us.\n\n00:08:20.617 --> 00:08:23.288\nThe second thing was,\n\n00:08:23.312 --> 00:08:26.740\nI stopped taking a salary\nfrom the church that I pastor.\n\n00:08:27.240 --> 00:08:29.979\nThird thing is, I added up\nall that the church had paid me\n\n00:08:30.003 --> 00:08:32.691\nover the last 25 years,\nand I gave it back.\n\n00:08:33.668 --> 00:08:36.358\nAnd I gave it back because\nI didn't want anybody thinking\n\n00:08:36.382 --> 00:08:38.690\nthat I do what I do for money -- I don't.\n\n00:08:38.714 --> 00:08:42.358\nIn fact, personally, I've never met\n\n00:08:42.382 --> 00:08:45.774\na priest or a pastor or a minister\nwho does it for money.\n\n00:08:45.798 --> 00:08:48.853\nI know that's the stereotype;\nI've never met one of them.\n\n00:08:48.877 --> 00:08:51.958\nBelieve me, there's a whole lot\neasier ways to make money.\n\n00:08:52.721 --> 00:08:56.539\nPastors are like on 24 hours-a-day call,\nthey're like doctors.\n\n00:08:56.563 --> 00:09:00.007\nI left late today -- I'd hoped\nto be here yesterday --\n\n00:09:00.031 --> 00:09:03.481\nbecause my father-in-law\nis in his last, probably, 48 hours\n\n00:09:03.505 --> 00:09:04.831\nbefore he dies of cancer.\n\n00:09:05.244 --> 00:09:07.934\nAnd I'm watching a guy\nwho's lived his life --\n\n00:09:07.958 --> 00:09:11.914\nhe's now in his mid-80s --\nand he's dying with peace.\n\n00:09:11.938 --> 00:09:17.019\nYou know, the test of your worldview\nis not how you act in the good times.\n\n00:09:17.513 --> 00:09:21.151\nThe test of your worldview\nis how you act at the funeral.\n\n00:09:22.310 --> 00:09:26.328\nAnd having been through literally\nhundreds if not thousands of funerals,\n\n00:09:26.352 --> 00:09:27.677\nit makes a difference.\n\n00:09:28.129 --> 00:09:30.161\nIt makes a difference what you believe.\n\n00:09:31.467 --> 00:09:35.332\nSo, we gave it all back,\n\n00:09:35.356 --> 00:09:38.194\nand then we set up three foundations,\n\n00:09:38.218 --> 00:09:40.615\nworking on some of the major\nproblems of the world:\n\n00:09:40.639 --> 00:09:46.489\nilliteracy, poverty, pandemic diseases --\nparticularly HIV/AIDS --\n\n00:09:46.513 --> 00:09:50.691\nand set up these three foundations,\nand put the money into that.\n\n00:09:50.715 --> 00:09:54.056\nThe last thing we did is we became\nwhat I call \"reverse tithers.\"\n\n00:09:54.493 --> 00:10:01.306\nAnd that is, when my wife\nand I got married 30 years ago,\n\n00:10:02.029 --> 00:10:04.873\nwe started tithing.\n\n00:10:04.897 --> 00:10:06.986\nNow, that's a principle in the Bible\n\n00:10:07.010 --> 00:10:10.093\nthat says give 10 percent\nof what you get back to charity,\n\n00:10:10.117 --> 00:10:11.958\ngive it away to help other people.\n\n00:10:12.823 --> 00:10:16.819\nSo, we started doing that, and each year\nwe would raise our tithe one percent.\n\n00:10:16.843 --> 00:10:19.341\nSo, our first year of marriage\nwe went to 11 percent,\n\n00:10:19.365 --> 00:10:21.002\nsecond year we went to 12 percent,\n\n00:10:21.026 --> 00:10:23.772\nand the third year we went to 13 percent,\n\n00:10:23.796 --> 00:10:25.051\nand on and on and on.\n\n00:10:26.297 --> 00:10:27.503\nWhy did I do that?\n\n00:10:27.527 --> 00:10:29.119\nBecause every time I give,\n\n00:10:29.143 --> 00:10:31.958\nit breaks the grip\nof materialism in my life.\n\n00:10:33.175 --> 00:10:37.779\nMaterialism is all about getting --\nget, get, get, get all you can,\n\n00:10:37.803 --> 00:10:40.526\ncan all you get, sit on the can\nand spoil the rest.\n\n00:10:41.557 --> 00:10:45.473\nIt's all about more, having more.\n\n00:10:45.497 --> 00:10:49.592\nAnd we think that the good life\nis actually looking good --\n\n00:10:49.616 --> 00:10:51.107\nthat's most important of all --\n\n00:10:51.131 --> 00:10:54.815\nlooking good, feeling good\nand having the goods.\n\n00:10:55.712 --> 00:10:57.108\nBut that's not the good life.\n\n00:10:57.490 --> 00:11:01.702\nI meet people all the time who have\nthose, and they're not necessarily happy.\n\n00:11:01.726 --> 00:11:03.934\nIf money actually made you happy,\n\n00:11:03.958 --> 00:11:06.911\nthen the wealthiest people\nin the world would be the happiest.\n\n00:11:06.935 --> 00:11:09.339\nAnd that I know, personally,\nI know, is not true.\n\n00:11:09.841 --> 00:11:11.037\nIt's just not true.\n\n00:11:11.958 --> 00:11:15.789\nSo, the good life is not about looking\ngood, feeling good or having the goods,\n\n00:11:15.813 --> 00:11:18.042\nit's about being good and doing good.\n\n00:11:19.060 --> 00:11:20.934\nGiving your life away.\n\n00:11:21.537 --> 00:11:25.205\nSignificance in life\ndoesn't come from status,\n\n00:11:25.229 --> 00:11:28.112\nbecause you can always find\nsomebody who's got more than you.\n\n00:11:28.136 --> 00:11:29.652\nIt doesn't come from sex.\n\n00:11:29.676 --> 00:11:31.492\nIt doesn't come from salary.\n\n00:11:32.262 --> 00:11:33.934\nIt comes from serving.\n\n00:11:34.616 --> 00:11:37.337\nIt is in giving our lives away\nthat we find meaning,\n\n00:11:37.361 --> 00:11:38.749\nwe find significance.\n\n00:11:39.448 --> 00:11:42.551\nThat's the way we were wired,\nI believe, by God.\n\n00:11:43.958 --> 00:11:46.934\nAnd so we began to give away,\n\n00:11:46.958 --> 00:11:48.934\nand now after 30 years,\n\n00:11:48.958 --> 00:11:52.816\nmy wife and I are reverse tithers --\nwe give away 90 percent and live on 10.\n\n00:11:54.013 --> 00:11:55.883\nThat, actually, was the easy part.\n\n00:11:55.907 --> 00:11:58.636\nThe hard part is, what do I do\nwith all this attention?\n\n00:11:59.120 --> 00:12:02.261\nBecause I started getting\nall kinds of invitations.\n\n00:12:02.285 --> 00:12:06.222\nI just came off a nearly\nmonth-long speaking tour\n\n00:12:06.246 --> 00:12:08.051\non three different continents,\n\n00:12:08.075 --> 00:12:10.765\nand I won't go into that,\n\n00:12:10.789 --> 00:12:12.752\nbut it was an amazing thing.\n\n00:12:13.410 --> 00:12:17.281\nAnd I'm going, what do I do\nwith this notoriety\n\n00:12:17.305 --> 00:12:18.749\nthat the book has brought?\n\n00:12:19.759 --> 00:12:23.013\nAnd, being a pastor,\nI started reading the Bible.\n\n00:12:23.568 --> 00:12:26.337\nThere's a chapter in the Bible\ncalled Psalm 72,\n\n00:12:26.361 --> 00:12:30.106\nand it's Solomon's prayer\nfor more influence.\n\n00:12:30.130 --> 00:12:31.934\nWhen you read this prayer,\n\n00:12:31.958 --> 00:12:35.918\nit sounds incredibly\nselfish, self-centered.\n\n00:12:35.981 --> 00:12:38.517\nHe says, \"God, I want you\nto make me famous.\"\n\n00:12:38.541 --> 00:12:39.981\nThat's what he prays.\n\n00:12:40.005 --> 00:12:41.872\nHe said, \"I want you to make me famous.\n\n00:12:41.896 --> 00:12:44.729\nI want you to spread the fame\nof my name through every land,\n\n00:12:44.753 --> 00:12:48.064\nI want you to give me power.\n\n00:12:48.088 --> 00:12:51.703\nI want you to make me famous,\nI want you to give me influence.\"\n\n00:12:51.727 --> 00:12:54.958\nAnd it just sounds like the most\negotistical request you could make,\n\n00:12:54.982 --> 00:12:56.306\nif you were going to pray.\n\n00:12:57.402 --> 00:13:00.051\nUntil you read the whole psalm,\nthe whole chapter.\n\n00:13:00.075 --> 00:13:02.693\nAnd then he says,\n\"So that the king ...\" --\n\n00:13:02.717 --> 00:13:07.504\nhe was the king of Israel\nat that time, at its apex in power --\n\n00:13:07.528 --> 00:13:11.267\n\"... so that the king may care\nfor the widow and orphan,\n\n00:13:11.291 --> 00:13:15.295\nsupport the oppressed, defend\nthe defenseless, care for the sick,\n\n00:13:15.319 --> 00:13:18.934\nassist the poor,\nspeak up for the foreigner,\n\n00:13:18.958 --> 00:13:20.934\nthose in prison.\"\n\n00:13:20.958 --> 00:13:24.127\nBasically, he's talking about\nall the marginalized in society.\n\n00:13:24.715 --> 00:13:26.304\nAnd as I read that,\n\n00:13:26.328 --> 00:13:29.758\nI looked at it, and I thought, you know,\n\n00:13:29.782 --> 00:13:33.729\nwhat this is saying is that the purpose\nof influence is to speak up\n\n00:13:33.753 --> 00:13:35.824\nfor those who have no influence.\n\n00:13:37.721 --> 00:13:40.410\nThe purpose of influence\nis not to build your ego.\n\n00:13:42.950 --> 00:13:44.102\nOr your net worth.\n\n00:13:44.126 --> 00:13:47.778\nAnd, by the way, your net worth is not\nthe same thing as your self-worth.\n\n00:13:47.802 --> 00:13:51.522\nYour value is not based on your valuables.\n\n00:13:52.958 --> 00:13:55.255\nIt's based on a whole\ndifferent set of things.\n\n00:13:55.690 --> 00:13:58.795\nAnd so the purpose\nof influence is to speak up\n\n00:13:58.819 --> 00:14:00.359\nfor those who have no influence.\n\n00:14:00.383 --> 00:14:02.297\nAnd I had to admit:\n\n00:14:02.321 --> 00:14:05.347\nI can't think of the last time\nI thought of widows and orphans.\n\n00:14:05.371 --> 00:14:07.471\nThey're not on my radar.\n\n00:14:08.219 --> 00:14:11.407\nI pastor a church in one of the most\naffluent areas of America --\n\n00:14:11.431 --> 00:14:13.288\na bunch of gated communities.\n\n00:14:13.312 --> 00:14:15.900\nI have a church full\nof CEOs and scientists.\n\n00:14:17.598 --> 00:14:21.934\nAnd I could go five years and never,\never see a homeless person.\n\n00:14:21.958 --> 00:14:23.934\nThey're just not in my pathway.\n\n00:14:24.337 --> 00:14:27.152\nNow, they're 13 miles\nup the road in Santa Ana.\n\n00:14:28.825 --> 00:14:30.934\nSo I had to say, ok,\n\n00:14:30.958 --> 00:14:34.743\nI would use whatever affluence\nand whatever influence I've got\n\n00:14:34.767 --> 00:14:38.337\nto help those who don't have\neither of those.\n\n00:14:39.568 --> 00:14:42.299\nYou know, there's a story\nin the Bible about Moses,\n\n00:14:42.323 --> 00:14:45.902\nwhether you believe it's true or not,\nit really doesn't matter to me.\n\n00:14:45.926 --> 00:14:48.566\nBut Moses, if you saw the movie,\n\"The Ten Commandments,\"\n\n00:14:48.590 --> 00:14:51.873\nMoses goes out, and there's this\nburning bush, and God talks to him,\n\n00:14:51.897 --> 00:14:55.652\nand God says,\n\"Moses, what's in your hand?\"\n\n00:14:57.219 --> 00:15:01.060\nI think that's one of the most important\nquestions you'll ever be asked:\n\n00:15:01.084 --> 00:15:02.411\nWhat's in your hand?\n\n00:15:03.374 --> 00:15:07.537\nMoses says, \"It's a staff.\nIt's a shepherd's staff.\"\n\n00:15:07.958 --> 00:15:09.824\nAnd God says, \"Throw it down.\"\n\n00:15:09.848 --> 00:15:14.561\nAnd if you saw the movie, you know,\nhe throws it down and it becomes a snake.\n\n00:15:16.188 --> 00:15:18.364\nAnd then God says, \"Pick it up.\"\n\n00:15:19.110 --> 00:15:20.934\nAnd he picks it back up again,\n\n00:15:20.958 --> 00:15:23.578\nand it becomes a staff again.\n\n00:15:24.315 --> 00:15:28.077\nNow, I'm reading this thing,\nand I'm going, what is that all about?\n\n00:15:28.101 --> 00:15:31.414\nOK. What's that all about? Well,\nI do know a couple of things.\n\n00:15:31.438 --> 00:15:34.553\nNumber one, God never does\na miracle to show off.\n\n00:15:35.049 --> 00:15:37.092\nIt's not just, \"Wow, isn't that cool?\"\n\n00:15:37.116 --> 00:15:40.331\nAnd, by the way, my God doesn't\nhave to show up on cheese bread.\n\n00:15:40.839 --> 00:15:44.734\nYou know, if God's going to show up,\nhe's not going to show up on cheese bread.\n\n00:15:44.758 --> 00:15:45.951\n(Laughter)\n\n00:15:45.975 --> 00:15:48.850\nOk? I just, this is why I love\nwhat Michael does,\n\n00:15:48.874 --> 00:15:53.532\nbecause it's like, if he's debunking it,\nthen I don't have to.\n\n00:15:53.556 --> 00:15:57.004\nBut God -- my God --\ndoesn't show up on sprinkler images.\n\n00:15:57.718 --> 00:16:01.934\nHe's got a few more powerful ways\nthan that to do whatever he wants to do.\n\n00:16:01.958 --> 00:16:05.040\nBut he doesn't do miracles\njust to show off.\n\n00:16:05.064 --> 00:16:07.363\nSecond thing is,\nif God ever asks you a question,\n\n00:16:07.387 --> 00:16:08.960\nhe already knows the answer.\n\n00:16:09.640 --> 00:16:11.857\nObviously, if he's God,\nthen that would mean\n\n00:16:11.881 --> 00:16:15.561\nthat when he asks the question,\nit's for your benefit, not his.\n\n00:16:15.585 --> 00:16:17.446\nSo he's going, \"What's in your hand?\"\n\n00:16:17.470 --> 00:16:18.934\nNow, what was in Moses' hand?\n\n00:16:18.958 --> 00:16:21.958\nWell, it was a shepherd's staff.\nNow, follow me on this.\n\n00:16:22.995 --> 00:16:26.400\nThis staff represented\nthree things about Moses' life.\n\n00:16:26.424 --> 00:16:29.963\nFirst, it represented his identity;\nhe was a shepherd.\n\n00:16:29.987 --> 00:16:33.286\nIt's the symbol of his own occupation:\n\n00:16:33.310 --> 00:16:34.611\nI am a shepherd.\n\n00:16:35.177 --> 00:16:37.934\nIt's a symbol of his identity,\nhis career, his job.\n\n00:16:38.327 --> 00:16:41.477\nSecond, it's a symbol\nof not only his identity,\n\n00:16:41.501 --> 00:16:45.656\nit's a symbol of his income, because all\nof his assets are tied up in sheep.\n\n00:16:45.680 --> 00:16:50.077\nIn those days, nobody had bank accounts,\nor American Express cards, or hedge funds.\n\n00:16:50.101 --> 00:16:52.815\nYour assets are tied up in your flocks.\n\n00:16:53.235 --> 00:16:56.917\nSo it's a symbol of his identity,\nand it's a symbol of his income.\n\n00:16:56.941 --> 00:16:59.584\nAnd the third thing:\nit's a symbol of his influence.\n\n00:17:00.306 --> 00:17:03.613\nWhat do you do with a shepherd's staff?\n\n00:17:03.637 --> 00:17:07.390\nWell, you know, you move sheep\nfrom point A to point B with it,\n\n00:17:07.414 --> 00:17:09.055\nby hook or by crook.\n\n00:17:09.079 --> 00:17:12.127\nYou pull them or you poke them.\nOne or the other.\n\n00:17:13.363 --> 00:17:15.291\nSo, he's saying,\n\n00:17:15.315 --> 00:17:17.354\n\"You're going to lay down your identity.\n\n00:17:17.378 --> 00:17:18.533\nWhat's in your hand?\n\n00:17:18.557 --> 00:17:21.430\nYou've got identity, you've got income,\nyou've got influence.\n\n00:17:21.454 --> 00:17:22.611\nWhat's in your hand?\"\n\n00:17:23.456 --> 00:17:26.385\nAnd he's saying, \"If you lay it down,\nI'll make it come alive.\n\n00:17:26.409 --> 00:17:28.984\nI'll do some things\nyou could never imagine possible.\"\n\n00:17:29.008 --> 00:17:31.502\nAnd if you've watched that movie,\n\"Ten Commandments,\"\n\n00:17:31.526 --> 00:17:36.006\nall of those big miracles that happen\nin Egypt are done through this staff.\n\n00:17:38.110 --> 00:17:43.165\nLast year, I was invited to speak\nat the NBA All-Stars game.\n\n00:17:43.898 --> 00:17:46.934\nAnd so, I'm talking to the players,\n\n00:17:46.958 --> 00:17:51.259\nbecause most of the NBA teams,\nNFL teams and all the other teams\n\n00:17:51.283 --> 00:17:54.132\nhave done this 40 Days of Purpose,\nbased on the book.\n\n00:17:54.466 --> 00:17:57.958\nAnd I asked them, I said,\n\"What's in your hand?\n\n00:17:59.350 --> 00:18:02.527\nSo, what's in your hand?\"\nI said, \"It's a basketball.\n\n00:18:03.369 --> 00:18:07.086\nAnd that basketball represents\nyour identity, who you are:\n\n00:18:07.110 --> 00:18:08.584\nyou're an NBA player.\n\n00:18:08.608 --> 00:18:10.180\nIt represents your income:\n\n00:18:10.204 --> 00:18:12.783\nyou're making a lot of money\noff that little ball.\n\n00:18:13.140 --> 00:18:14.958\nAnd it represents your influence.\n\n00:18:15.603 --> 00:18:18.910\nAnd even though you're only going\nto be in the NBA for a few years,\n\n00:18:18.934 --> 00:18:21.721\nyou're going to be an NBA player\nfor the rest of your life.\n\n00:18:21.745 --> 00:18:23.840\nAnd that gives you enormous influence.\n\n00:18:24.212 --> 00:18:27.487\nSo, what are you going to do\nwith what you've been given?\"\n\n00:18:28.743 --> 00:18:33.232\nAnd I guess that's the main reason\nI came up here today,\n\n00:18:33.256 --> 00:18:36.185\nto all of you very bright people at TED --\n\n00:18:36.209 --> 00:18:38.106\nit is to say, \"What's in your hand?\"\n\n00:18:40.114 --> 00:18:43.633\nWhat do you have that you've been given?\n\n00:18:44.564 --> 00:18:47.934\nTalent, background, education,\n\n00:18:47.958 --> 00:18:52.117\nfreedom, networks, opportunities,\n\n00:18:52.141 --> 00:18:55.684\nwealth, ideas, creativity.\n\n00:18:55.708 --> 00:18:59.757\nWhat are you doing\nwith what you've been given?\n\n00:18:59.781 --> 00:19:03.671\nThat, to me, is the primary\nquestion about life.\n\n00:19:03.695 --> 00:19:06.777\nThat, to me, is what being\npurpose-driven is all about.\n\n00:19:07.957 --> 00:19:11.161\nIn the book, I talk about\nhow you're wired to do certain things,\n\n00:19:11.185 --> 00:19:14.854\nyou're \"SHAPED\" with -- a little acrostic:\nSpiritual gifts, Heart,\n\n00:19:14.878 --> 00:19:17.266\nAbility, Personality and Experiences.\n\n00:19:17.290 --> 00:19:18.934\nThese things shape you.\n\n00:19:19.378 --> 00:19:22.502\nAnd if you want to know what you ought\nto be doing with your life,\n\n00:19:22.526 --> 00:19:25.263\nyou need to look at your shape --\n\"What am I wired to do?\"\n\n00:19:25.287 --> 00:19:28.605\nWhy would God wire you to do something\nand then not have you do it?\n\n00:19:28.629 --> 00:19:31.877\nIf you're wired to be an anthropologist,\nyou'll be an anthropologist.\n\n00:19:31.901 --> 00:19:33.909\nIf you're wired to be\nan undersea explorer,\n\n00:19:33.933 --> 00:19:35.425\nyou'll be an undersea explorer.\n\n00:19:35.449 --> 00:19:37.615\nIf you're wired to make deals,\nyou make deals.\n\n00:19:37.639 --> 00:19:39.598\nIf you're wired to paint, you paint.\n\n00:19:40.313 --> 00:19:42.958\nDid you know that God smiles\nwhen you be you?\n\n00:19:44.532 --> 00:19:46.879\nWhen my little kids --\nwhen my kids were little --\n\n00:19:46.903 --> 00:19:48.910\nthey're all grown now, I have grandkids --\n\n00:19:48.934 --> 00:19:51.246\nI used to go in and sit\non the side of their bed,\n\n00:19:51.270 --> 00:19:53.038\nand I used to watch my kids sleep.\n\n00:19:54.110 --> 00:19:59.556\nAnd I just watched their little bodies\nrise and lower, rise and lower.\n\n00:19:59.580 --> 00:20:02.435\nAnd I would look at them:\n\"This is not an accident.\"\n\n00:20:02.459 --> 00:20:04.165\nRise and lower.\n\n00:20:05.205 --> 00:20:08.958\nAnd I got joy out of just\nwatching them sleep.\n\n00:20:10.958 --> 00:20:14.525\nSome people have the misguided idea\nthat God only gets excited\n\n00:20:14.549 --> 00:20:16.669\nwhen you're doing, quote,\n\"spiritual things,\"\n\n00:20:16.693 --> 00:20:19.406\nlike going to church or helping the poor,\n\n00:20:19.430 --> 00:20:22.783\nor, you know, confessing\nor doing something like that.\n\n00:20:23.378 --> 00:20:27.736\nThe bottom line is, God gets pleasure\nwatching you be you.\n\n00:20:27.760 --> 00:20:29.164\nWhy? He made you.\n\n00:20:29.848 --> 00:20:32.245\nAnd when you do what you were made to do,\n\n00:20:32.269 --> 00:20:36.316\nhe goes, \"That's my boy! That's my girl!\n\n00:20:36.340 --> 00:20:39.725\nYou're using the talent\nand ability that I gave you.\"\n\n00:20:40.471 --> 00:20:42.351\nSo my advice to you is:\n\n00:20:42.375 --> 00:20:44.105\nlook at what's in your hand --\n\n00:20:44.129 --> 00:20:47.668\nyour identity, your influence,\nyour income --\n\n00:20:48.819 --> 00:20:51.322\nand say, \"It's not about me.\n\n00:20:51.346 --> 00:20:54.386\nIt's about making the world\na better place.\"\n\n00:20:55.392 --> 00:20:56.542\nThank you."}, {"title": "My wish: A call for open-source architecture", "duration": "1414", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/cameron_sinclair_on_open_source_architecture", "transcript": "I'm going to take you on a journey very quickly. To explain the wish, I'm going to have to take you somewhere where many people haven't been, and that's around the world. When I was about 24 years old, Kate Stohr and myself started an organization to get architects and designers involved in humanitarian work, not only about responding to natural disasters, but involved in systemic issues. We believe that where the resources and expertise are scarce, innovative, sustainable design can really make a difference in people's lives.So I started my life as an architect, or training as an architect, and I was always interested in socially responsible design, and how you can really make an impact. But when I went to architecture school, it seemed that I was a black sheep in the family. Many architects seemed to think that when you design, you design a jewel, and it's a jewel that you try and crave for; whereas I felt that when you design, you either improve or you create a detriment to the community in which you're designing. So you're not just doing a building for the residents or for the people who are going to use it, but for the community as a whole.And in 1999, we started by responding to the issue of the housing crisis for returning refugees in Kosovo. And I didn't know what I was doing \u2014 like I said, mid-20s \u2014 and I'm the Internet generation, so we started a website. We put a call out there, and to my surprise, in a couple of months, we had hundreds of entries from around the world. That led to a number of prototypes being built and really experimenting with some ideas. Two years later we started doing a project on developing mobile health clinics in sub-Saharan Africa, responding to the HIV/AIDS pandemic. That led to 550 entries from 53 countries. We also have designers from around the world that participate. And we had an exhibit of work that followed that. 2004 was the tipping point for us. We started responding to natural disasters and getting involved in Iran, in Bam, also following up on our work in Africa.Working within the United States \u2014 most people look at poverty and they see the face of a foreigner. But I live in Bozeman, Montana \u2014 go up to the north plains on the reservations, or go down to Alabama or Mississippi, pre-Katrina, and I could have shown you places that have far worse conditions than many developing countries that I've been to. So we got involved in and worked in inner cities and elsewhere;and also, I will go into some more projects. 2005: Mother Nature kicked our ass. I think we can pretty much assume that 2005 was a horrific year when it comes to natural disasters. And because of the Internet, and because of connections to blogs and so forth, within literally hours of the tsunami, we were already raising funds, getting involved, working with people on the ground. We run from a couple of laptops, and in the first couple of days, I had 4,000 emails from people needing help. So we began to get involved in projects there, and I'll talk about some others. And then of course, this year we've been responding to Katrina, as well as following up on our reconstruction work.So this is a brief overview. In 2004, I really couldn't manage the number of people who wanted to help, or the number of requests that I was getting. It was all coming into my laptop and cell phone. So we decided to embrace an open-source model of business \u2014 so that anyone, anywhere in the world, could start a local chapter, and they can get involved in local problems. Because I believe there is no such thing as Utopia. All problems are local. All solutions are local. So that means, you know, somebody who's based in Mississippi knows more about Mississippi than I do. So what happened is, we used Meetup and all these other Internet tools, and we ended up having 40 chapters starting up, thousands of architects in 104 countries. So the bullet point \u2014 sorry, I never do a suit, so I knew that I was going to take this off. OK, because I'm going to do it very quick.This isn't just about nonprofit. What it showed me is that there's a grassroots movement going on, of socially responsible designers who really believe that this world has got a lot smaller, and that we have the opportunity \u2014 not the responsibility, but the opportunity \u2014 to really get involved in making change.(Laughter)(Laughter)I'm adding that to my time.(Laughter)So what you don't know is, we've got these thousands of designers working around the world, connected basically by a website, and we have a staff of three. The fact that nobody told us we couldn't do it, we did it. And so there's something to be said about na\u00efvet\u00e9. So seven years later, we've developed so that we've got advocacy, instigation and implementation. We advocate for good design, not only through student workshops and lectures and public forums, op-eds; we have a book on humanitarian work; but also disaster mitigation and dealing with public policy. We can talk about FEMA, but that's another talk. Instigation, developing ideas with communities and NGOs, doing open-source design competitions. Referring, matchmaking with communities. And then implementing \u2014 actually going out there and doing the work, because when you invent, it's never a reality until it's built. So it's really important that if we're designing and trying to create change, we build that change.So here's a select number of projects. Kosovo. This is Kosovo in '99. We did an open design competition, like I said. It led to a whole variety of ideas. And this wasn't about emergency shelter, but transitional shelter that would last five to 10 years, that would be placed next to the land the resident lived in, and that they would rebuild their own home. This wasn't imposing an architecture on a community; this was giving them the tools and the space to allow them to rebuild and regrow the way they want to. We had from the sublime to the ridiculous, but they worked. This is an inflatable hemp house. It was built; it works.This is a shipping container. Built and works. And a whole variety of ideas that not only dealt with architectural building, but also the issues of governance, and the idea of creating communities through complex networks.So we've engaged not just designers, but also a whole variety of technology-based professionals. Using rubble from destroyed homes to create new homes. Using straw bale construction, creating heat walls. And then something remarkable happened in '99.We went to Africa originally to look at the housing issue. Within three days, we realized the problem was not housing; it was the growing pandemic of HIV/AIDS. And it wasn't doctors telling us this; it was actual villagers that we were staying with. And so we came up with the bright idea that instead of getting people to walk 10, 15 kilometers to see doctors, you get the doctors to the people. And we started engaging the medical community, and you know, we thought we were real bright sparks \u2014 \"We've come up with this great idea: mobile health clinics, widely distributed throughout sub-Saharan Africa.\" And the medical community there said, \"We've said this for the last decade. We know this. We just don't know how to show this.\" So in a way, we had taken pre-existing needs and shown solutions. And so again, we had a whole variety of ideas that came in.This one I personally love, because the idea is that architecture is not just about solutions, but about raising awareness. This is a kenaf clinic. You get seed and you grow it in a plot of land, and it grows 14 feet in a month. And on the fourth week, the doctors come and they mow out an area, put a tensile structure on the top, and when the doctors have finished treating and seeing patients and villagers, you cut down the clinic and you eat it. It's an eat-your-own-clinic.So it's dealing with the fact that if you have AIDS, you also need to have nutrition rates, and the idea of nutrition is as important as getting antiretrovirals out there. So you know, this is a serious solution. This one I love. The idea is it's not just a clinic, it's a community center. This looked at setting up trade routes and economic engines within the community, so it can be a self-sustaining project.Every one of these projects is sustainable. That's not because I'm a tree-hugging green person. It's because when you live on four dollars a day, you're living on survival and you have to be sustainable. You have to know where your energy is coming from, you have to know where your resource is coming from, and you have to keep the maintenance down. So this is about getting an economic engine, and then at night, it turns into a movie theater. So it's not an AIDS clinic. It's a community center. So you can see ideas. And these ideas developed into prototypes, and they were eventually built. And currently, as of this year, there are clinics rolling out in Nigeria and Kenya.From that, we also developed Siyathemba. The community came to us and said, \"The problem is that the girls don't have education.\" And we're working in an area where young women between the ages of 16 and 24 have a 50 percent HIV/AIDS rate. And that's not because they're promiscuous, it's because there's no knowledge.And so we decided to look at the idea of sports, and create a youth sports center that doubled as an HIV/AIDS outreach center, and the coaches of the girls' team were also trained doctors. So that there would be a very slow way of developing confidence in health care. And we picked nine finalists, and then those nine finalists were distributed throughout the entire region, and then the community picked their design. They said, this is our design, because it's not only about engaging a community; it's about empowering a community, and about getting them to be a part of the rebuilding process.So, the winning design is here. And then, of course, we actually go and work with the community and the clients.So this is the designer. He's out there working with the first ever women's soccer team in KwaZulu-Natal, Siyathemba. And they can tell it better.(A cappella singing in a South African language)Video: Well, my name is Cee Cee Mkhonza. I work at the Africa Centre, I'm an IT user consultant. I'm also the national football player for South Africa, Banyana Banyana. And I also play in the Vodacom League, for the team called Tembisa, which has now changed to Siyathemba. This is our home ground.Cameron Sinclair: I'm going to show that later because I'm running out of time. I can see Chris looking at me slyly.This was a connection, just a meeting with somebody who wanted to develop Africa's first telemedicine center, in Tanzania. And we met, literally, a couple of months ago. We've already developed a design. The team is over there, working in partnership. This was a matchmaking, thanks to a couple of TEDsters \u2014 Sun [Microsystems], Cheryl Heller and Andrew Zolli, who connected me with this amazing African woman. And we start construction in June, and it will be opened by TEDGlobal. So when you come to TEDGlobal, you can check it out.But what we're known probably most for is dealing with disasters and development, and we've been involved in a lot of issues, such as the tsunami and also things like Hurricane Katrina. This is a 370-dollar shelter that can be easily assembled. This is a community-designed community center. And what that means is we actually live and work with the community, and they're part of the design process. The kids actually get involved in mapping out where the community center should be. And then eventually, the community, through skills training, end up building the building with us.Here is another school. This is what the UN gave these guys for six months \u2014 12 plastic tarps. This was in August. This was the replacement; that's supposed to last for two years. When the rain comes down, you can't hear a thing, and in the summer, it's about 140 degrees inside. So we said, if the rain's coming down, let's get fresh water. So every one of our schools has a rainwater collection system. Very low cost: three classrooms and rainwater collection is 5,000 dollars. This was raised by hot chocolate sales in Atlanta. It's built by the parents of the kids. The kids are out there on-site, building the buildings. And it opened a couple of weeks ago, and there's 600 kids that are now using the schools.(Applause)So, disaster hits home. We see the bad stories on CNN and Fox and all that, but we don't see the good stories. Here is a community that got together, and they said \"no\" to waiting. They formed a partnership, a diverse partnership of players, to actually map out East Biloxi, to figure out who's getting involved. We've had over 1,500 volunteers rebuilding, rehabbing homes. Figuring out what FEMA regulations are, not waiting for them to dictate to us how you should rebuild. Working with residents, getting them out of their homes, so they don't get ill. This is what they're cleaning up on their own. Designing housing. This house is going in in a couple of weeks. This is a rehabbed home, done in four days. This is a utility room for a woman who is on a walker. She's 70 years old. This is what FEMA gave her. 600 bucks, happened two days ago. We put together, very quickly, a washroom. It's built, it's running and she just started a business today, where she's washing other people's clothes.These are the Calhouns. They're photographers who had documented the Lower Ninth for the last 40 years. That was their home, and these are the photographs they took. And we're helping, working with them to create a new building. Projects we've done. Projects we've been a part of, support. Why don't aid agencies do this? This is the UN tent. This is the new UN tent, just introduced this year. Quick to assemble. It's got a flap \u2014 that's the invention. It took 20 years to design this and get it implemented in the field. I was 12 years old. There's a problem here.Luckily, we're not alone. There are hundreds and hundreds and hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of architects and designers and inventors around the world that are getting involved in humanitarian work. More hemp houses \u2014 it's a theme in Japan, apparently. I'm not sure what they're smoking.(Laughter)This is a Grip Clip, designed by somebody who said, \"All you need is some way to attach membrane structures to physical support beams.\" This guy designed for NASA, is now doing housing. I'm going to whip through this quickly, because I know I've got only a couple of minutes.So this is all done in the last two years. I showed you something that took 20 years to do. And this is just a selection of things that were built in the last couple of years. From Brazil to India, Mexico, Alabama, China, Israel, Palestine, Vietnam.The average age of a designer who gets involved in this project is 32 \u2014 that's how old I am. So it's a young \u2014 I just have to stop here, because Arup is in the room, and this is the best-designed toilet in the world. If you're ever, ever in India, go use this toilet.(Laughter)Chris Luebkeman will tell you why. I'm sure that's how he wanted to spend the party. But the future is not going to be the sky-scraping cities of New York, but this. And when you look at this, you see crisis. What I see is many, many inventors. One billion people live in abject poverty. We hear about them all the time. Four billion live in growing but fragile economies. One in seven live in unplanned settlements. If we do nothing about the housing crisis that's about to happen, in 20 years, one in three people will live in an unplanned settlement or a refugee camp. Look left, look right: one of you will be there. How do we improve the living standards of five billion people? With 10 million solutions.So I wish to develop a community that actively embraces innovative and sustainable design to improve the living conditions for everyone.Chris Anderson: Wait a sec \u2014 that's your wish?CS: That's my wish.CA: That's his wish!(Applause)CS: We started Architecture for Humanity with 700 dollars and a website. So Chris somehow decided to give me 100,000. So why not this many people? Open-source architecture is the way to go. You have a diverse community of participants \u2014 and we're not just talking about inventors and designers, but we're talking about the funding model. My role is not as a designer; it's as a conduit between the design world and the humanitarian world. And what we need is something that replicates me globally, because I haven't slept in seven years.(Laughter)Secondly, what will this thing be? Designers want to respond to issues of humanitarian crisis, but they don't want some company in the West taking their idea and basically profiting from it. So Creative Commons has developed the Developing Nations license. And what that means is that a designer can \u2014 The Siyathemba project I showed was the first ever building to have a Creative Commons license on it. As soon as that is built, anyone in Africa or any developing nation can take the construction documents and replicate it for free.(Applause)So why not allow designers the opportunity to do this, but still protect their rights here? We want to have a community where you can upload ideas, and those ideas can be tested in an earthquake, in flood, in all sorts of austere environments. The reason that's important is I don't want to wait for the next Katrina to find out if my house works. That's too late, we need to do it now. So doing that globally \u2014 and I want this whole thing to work multi-lingually. When you look at the face of an architect, most people think a gray-haired white guy. I don't see that; I see the face of the world. So I want everyone from all over the planet to be able to be a part of this design and development. The idea of needs-based competitions \u2014 XPRIZE for the other 98 percent, if you want to call it that.We also want to look at ways of matchmaking and putting funding partners together, and the idea of integrating manufacturers \u2014 fab labs in every country. When I hear about the $100 laptop and it's going to educate every child \u2014 educate every designer in the world. Put one in every favela, every slum settlement. Because you know what? Innovation will happen. And I need to know that. It's called the leap-back. We talk about leapfrog technologies.I write with Worldchanging, and the one thing we've been talking about is, I learn more on the ground than I've ever learned here. So let's take those ideas, adapt them, and we can use them. These ideas are supposed to be adaptable; they should have the potential for evolution; they should be developed by every nation in the world and useful for every nation in the world. What will it take?There should be a sheet. I don't have time to read this, because I'm going to be yanked off.CA: Let's just leave it up for a sec.CS: Well, what will it take? You guys are smart. So it's going to take a lot of computing power, because I want the idea that any laptop anywhere in the world can plug into the system and be able to not only participate in developing these designs, but utilize the designs. Also, a process of reviewing the designs. I want every Arup engineer in the world to check and make sure that we're doing stuff that's standing, because those guys are the best in the world. Plug. And so, you know, I want these \u2014I just should note: I have two laptops and one of them is there, and that has 3000 designs on it. If I drop that laptop ... What happens? So it's important to have these proven ideas put up there, easy to use, easy to get ahold of. My mom once said, \"There's nothing worse than being all mouth and no trousers.\"(Laughter)I'm fed up of talking about making change. You only make it by doing it. We've changed FEMA guidelines; we've changed public policy; we've changed international response \u2014 based on building things. So for me, it's important that we create a real conduit for innovation, and that it's free innovation. Think of free culture \u2014 this is free innovation. Somebody said this a couple of years back. I will give points for those who know it. But I think the man was maybe 25 years too early.So let's do it.Thank you.(Applause)", "id": 54, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:11.958 -->

clinics\nin sub-Saharan Africa,\n\n00:01:53.043 --> 00:01:55.594\nresponding to the HIV/AIDS pandemic.\n\n00:01:57.376 --> 00:02:03.760\nThat led to 550 entries from 53 countries.\n\n00:02:03.784 --> 00:02:08.534\nWe also have designers\nfrom around the world that participate.\n\n00:02:08.558 --> 00:02:12.204\nAnd we had an exhibit\nof work that followed that.\n\n00:02:12.228 --> 00:02:14.642\n2004 was the tipping point for us.\n\n00:02:14.666 --> 00:02:16.687\nWe started responding to natural disasters\n\n00:02:16.711 --> 00:02:19.332\nand getting involved in Iran, in Bam,\n\n00:02:19.356 --> 00:02:22.056\nalso following up on our work in Africa.\n\n00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:23.928\nWorking within the United States --\n\n00:02:23.952 --> 00:02:27.023\nmost people look at poverty\nand they see the face of a foreigner.\n\n00:02:27.047 --> 00:02:29.121\nBut I live in Bozeman, Montana --\n\n00:02:29.145 --> 00:02:31.363\ngo up to the north plains\non the reservations,\n\n00:02:31.387 --> 00:02:34.812\nor go down to Alabama\nor Mississippi, pre-Katrina,\n\n00:02:34.836 --> 00:02:37.868\nand I could have shown you\nplaces that have far worse conditions\n\n00:02:37.892 --> 00:02:40.198\nthan many developing countries\nthat I've been to.\n\n00:02:40.222 --> 00:02:43.710\nSo we got involved in and worked\nin inner cities and elsewhere;\n\n00:02:43.734 --> 00:02:47.151\nand also, I will go into\nsome more projects.\n\n00:02:47.175 --> 00:02:50.069\n2005: Mother Nature kicked our ass.\n\n00:02:50.093 --> 00:02:54.846\nI think we can pretty much assume\nthat 2005 was a horrific year\n\n00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:56.537\nwhen it comes to natural disasters.\n\n00:02:56.561 --> 00:02:58.051\nAnd because of the Internet,\n\n00:02:58.075 --> 00:03:01.464\nand because of connections\nto blogs and so forth,\n\n00:03:01.488 --> 00:03:05.940\nwithin literally hours of the tsunami,\nwe were already raising funds,\n\n00:03:05.964 --> 00:03:09.023\ngetting involved, working\nwith people on the ground.\n\n00:03:09.564 --> 00:03:12.746\nWe run from a couple of laptops,\nand in the first couple of days,\n\n00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:15.533\nI had 4,000 emails\nfrom people needing help.\n\n00:03:15.873 --> 00:03:18.746\nSo we began to get involved\nin projects there,\n\n00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:20.384\nand I'll talk about some others.\n\n00:03:20.408 --> 00:03:23.379\nAnd then of course, this year\nwe've been responding to Katrina,\n\n00:03:23.403 --> 00:03:25.847\nas well as following up\non our reconstruction work.\n\n00:03:25.871 --> 00:03:27.582\nSo this is a brief overview.\n\n00:03:28.558 --> 00:03:32.975\nIn 2004, I really couldn't manage\nthe number of people who wanted to help,\n\n00:03:32.999 --> 00:03:35.104\nor the number of requests\nthat I was getting.\n\n00:03:35.128 --> 00:03:37.659\nIt was all coming\ninto my laptop and cell phone.\n\n00:03:37.683 --> 00:03:43.056\nSo we decided to embrace\nan open-source model of business --\n\n00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:46.247\nso that anyone, anywhere in the world,\ncould start a local chapter,\n\n00:03:46.271 --> 00:03:48.337\nand they can get involved\nin local problems.\n\n00:03:48.361 --> 00:03:50.772\nBecause I believe there\nis no such thing as Utopia.\n\n00:03:50.796 --> 00:03:53.368\nAll problems are local.\nAll solutions are local.\n\n00:03:53.392 --> 00:03:58.026\nSo that means, you know,\nsomebody who's based in Mississippi\n\n00:03:58.050 --> 00:04:00.403\nknows more about Mississippi than I do.\n\n00:04:00.427 --> 00:04:06.534\nSo what happened is, we used Meetup\nand all these other Internet tools,\n\n00:04:06.558 --> 00:04:10.849\nand we ended up having\n40 chapters starting up,\n\n00:04:10.873 --> 00:04:13.664\nthousands of architects in 104 countries.\n\n00:04:14.966 --> 00:04:18.407\nSo the bullet point --\nsorry, I never do a suit,\n\n00:04:18.431 --> 00:04:20.826\nso I knew that I was going\nto take this off.\n\n00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:23.153\nOK, because I'm going to do it very quick.\n\n00:04:25.161 --> 00:04:27.184\nThis isn't just about nonprofit.\n\n00:04:27.208 --> 00:04:30.382\nWhat it showed me is that\nthere's a grassroots movement going on,\n\n00:04:30.406 --> 00:04:32.980\nof socially responsible designers\nwho really believe\n\n00:04:33.004 --> 00:04:36.916\nthat this world has got a lot smaller,\nand that we have the opportunity --\n\n00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:39.096\nnot the responsibility,\nbut the opportunity --\n\n00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:41.433\nto really get involved in making change.\n\n00:04:43.623 --> 00:04:46.705\n(Laughter)\n\n00:04:48.899 --> 00:04:52.923\n(Laughter)\n\n00:04:52.947 --> 00:04:54.746\nI'm adding that to my time.\n\n00:04:54.770 --> 00:04:57.571\n(Laughter)\n\n00:04:57.595 --> 00:04:59.534\nSo what you don't know is,\n\n00:04:59.558 --> 00:05:02.582\nwe've got these thousands of designers\nworking around the world,\n\n00:05:02.606 --> 00:05:05.637\nconnected basically by a website,\nand we have a staff of three.\n\n00:05:06.462 --> 00:05:10.876\nThe fact that nobody told us\nwe couldn't do it, we did it.\n\n00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:13.248\nAnd so there's something\nto be said about na\u00efvet\u00e9.\n\n00:05:13.272 --> 00:05:15.169\nSo seven years later, we've developed\n\n00:05:15.193 --> 00:05:18.607\nso that we've got advocacy,\ninstigation and implementation.\n\n00:05:18.631 --> 00:05:22.276\nWe advocate for good design,\nnot only through student workshops\n\n00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:24.622\nand lectures and public forums, op-eds;\n\n00:05:24.646 --> 00:05:26.867\nwe have a book on humanitarian work;\n\n00:05:26.891 --> 00:05:30.074\nbut also disaster mitigation\nand dealing with public policy.\n\n00:05:30.098 --> 00:05:33.312\nWe can talk about FEMA,\nbut that's another talk.\n\n00:05:33.994 --> 00:05:37.354\nInstigation, developing ideas\nwith communities and NGOs,\n\n00:05:37.378 --> 00:05:40.206\ndoing open-source design competitions.\n\n00:05:40.230 --> 00:05:42.738\nReferring, matchmaking with communities.\n\n00:05:42.762 --> 00:05:46.069\nAnd then implementing -- actually\ngoing out there and doing the work,\n\n00:05:46.093 --> 00:05:51.827\nbecause when you invent,\nit's never a reality until it's built.\n\n00:05:52.296 --> 00:05:55.037\nSo it's really important\nthat if we're designing\n\n00:05:55.061 --> 00:05:57.735\nand trying to create change,\nwe build that change.\n\n00:05:57.759 --> 00:05:59.819\nSo here's a select number of projects.\n\n00:06:01.422 --> 00:06:02.644\nKosovo.\n\n00:06:03.628 --> 00:06:05.300\nThis is Kosovo in '99.\n\n00:06:05.665 --> 00:06:08.515\nWe did an open design\ncompetition, like I said.\n\n00:06:08.539 --> 00:06:10.933\nIt led to a whole variety of ideas.\n\n00:06:10.957 --> 00:06:12.875\nAnd this wasn't about emergency shelter,\n\n00:06:12.899 --> 00:06:16.421\nbut transitional shelter\nthat would last five to 10 years,\n\n00:06:16.445 --> 00:06:20.454\nthat would be placed next to the land\nthe resident lived in,\n\n00:06:20.478 --> 00:06:22.605\nand that they would rebuild\ntheir own home.\n\n00:06:22.629 --> 00:06:25.307\nThis wasn't imposing\nan architecture on a community;\n\n00:06:25.331 --> 00:06:28.453\nthis was giving them\nthe tools and the space\n\n00:06:28.477 --> 00:06:32.166\nto allow them to rebuild and regrow\nthe way they want to.\n\n00:06:33.245 --> 00:06:36.165\nWe had from the sublime\nto the ridiculous, but they worked.\n\n00:06:36.189 --> 00:06:40.789\nThis is an inflatable hemp house.\nIt was built; it works.\n\n00:06:41.558 --> 00:06:43.473\nThis is a shipping container.\n\n00:06:44.638 --> 00:06:46.298\nBuilt and works.\n\n00:06:46.322 --> 00:06:47.672\nAnd a whole variety of ideas\n\n00:06:47.696 --> 00:06:51.203\nthat not only dealt with\narchitectural building,\n\n00:06:51.227 --> 00:06:52.901\nbut also the issues of governance,\n\n00:06:52.925 --> 00:06:56.336\nand the idea of creating communities\nthrough complex networks.\n\n00:06:56.360 --> 00:06:58.182\nSo we've engaged not just designers,\n\n00:06:58.206 --> 00:07:03.731\nbut also a whole variety\nof technology-based professionals.\n\n00:07:03.755 --> 00:07:07.362\nUsing rubble from destroyed homes\nto create new homes.\n\n00:07:07.386 --> 00:07:13.240\nUsing straw bale construction,\ncreating heat walls.\n\n00:07:13.692 --> 00:07:15.860\nAnd then something remarkable\nhappened in '99.\n\n00:07:15.884 --> 00:07:19.657\nWe went to Africa originally\nto look at the housing issue.\n\n00:07:20.006 --> 00:07:22.793\nWithin three days, we realized\nthe problem was not housing;\n\n00:07:22.817 --> 00:07:25.523\nit was the growing pandemic of HIV/AIDS.\n\n00:07:25.928 --> 00:07:27.781\nAnd it wasn't doctors telling us this;\n\n00:07:27.805 --> 00:07:30.472\nit was actual villagers\nthat we were staying with.\n\n00:07:30.829 --> 00:07:33.441\nAnd so we came up with the bright idea\n\n00:07:33.465 --> 00:07:37.660\nthat instead of getting people to walk\n10, 15 kilometers to see doctors,\n\n00:07:37.684 --> 00:07:39.523\nyou get the doctors to the people.\n\n00:07:39.547 --> 00:07:42.415\nAnd we started engaging\nthe medical community,\n\n00:07:42.439 --> 00:07:45.542\nand you know, we thought\nwe were real bright sparks --\n\n00:07:45.566 --> 00:07:47.312\n\"We've come up with this great idea:\n\n00:07:47.336 --> 00:07:51.918\nmobile health clinics, widely distributed\nthroughout sub-Saharan Africa.\"\n\n00:07:52.307 --> 00:07:54.751\nAnd the medical community there said,\n\n00:07:54.775 --> 00:07:57.241\n\"We've said this for the last decade.\n\n00:07:57.265 --> 00:08:00.343\nWe know this. We just don't know\nhow to show this.\"\n\n00:08:00.367 --> 00:08:05.611\nSo in a way, we had taken pre-existing\nneeds and shown solutions.\n\n00:08:06.135 --> 00:08:10.092\nAnd so again, we had a whole variety\nof ideas that came in.\n\n00:08:11.131 --> 00:08:12.974\nThis one I personally love,\n\n00:08:12.998 --> 00:08:16.299\nbecause the idea is that architecture\nis not just about solutions,\n\n00:08:16.323 --> 00:08:18.002\nbut about raising awareness.\n\n00:08:18.026 --> 00:08:20.440\nThis is a kenaf clinic.\n\n00:08:20.464 --> 00:08:23.534\nYou get seed and you grow it\nin a plot of land,\n\n00:08:23.558 --> 00:08:27.227\nand it grows 14 feet in a month.\n\n00:08:27.251 --> 00:08:30.403\nAnd on the fourth week, the doctors\ncome and they mow out an area,\n\n00:08:30.427 --> 00:08:32.506\nput a tensile structure on the top,\n\n00:08:32.530 --> 00:08:35.202\nand when the doctors\nhave finished treating\n\n00:08:35.226 --> 00:08:38.947\nand seeing patients and villagers,\n\n00:08:38.971 --> 00:08:40.843\nyou cut down the clinic and you eat it.\n\n00:08:40.867 --> 00:08:42.534\nIt's an eat-your-own-clinic.\n\n00:08:42.558 --> 00:08:45.912\nSo it's dealing with the fact\nthat if you have AIDS,\n\n00:08:45.936 --> 00:08:47.880\nyou also need to have nutrition rates,\n\n00:08:47.904 --> 00:08:50.760\nand the idea of nutrition is as important\n\n00:08:50.784 --> 00:08:52.618\nas getting antiretrovirals out there.\n\n00:08:52.642 --> 00:08:55.130\nSo you know, this is a serious solution.\n\n00:08:56.001 --> 00:08:57.157\nThis one I love.\n\n00:08:57.181 --> 00:09:00.006\nThe idea is it's not just a clinic,\nit's a community center.\n\n00:09:00.030 --> 00:09:02.053\nThis looked at setting up trade routes\n\n00:09:02.077 --> 00:09:04.142\nand economic engines within the community,\n\n00:09:04.166 --> 00:09:06.380\nso it can be a self-sustaining project.\n\n00:09:06.404 --> 00:09:08.721\nEvery one of these projects\nis sustainable.\n\n00:09:09.134 --> 00:09:12.438\nThat's not because\nI'm a tree-hugging green person.\n\n00:09:12.462 --> 00:09:14.786\nIt's because when you live\non four dollars a day,\n\n00:09:14.810 --> 00:09:17.833\nyou're living on survival\nand you have to be sustainable.\n\n00:09:18.185 --> 00:09:20.535\nYou have to know where\nyour energy is coming from,\n\n00:09:20.559 --> 00:09:23.011\nyou have to know where\nyour resource is coming from,\n\n00:09:23.035 --> 00:09:25.049\nand you have to keep the maintenance down.\n\n00:09:25.073 --> 00:09:27.161\nSo this is about getting\nan economic engine,\n\n00:09:27.185 --> 00:09:29.478\nand then at night,\nit turns into a movie theater.\n\n00:09:29.502 --> 00:09:34.629\nSo it's not an AIDS clinic.\nIt's a community center.\n\n00:09:34.653 --> 00:09:36.153\nSo you can see ideas.\n\n00:09:36.867 --> 00:09:39.534\nAnd these ideas developed into prototypes,\n\n00:09:39.558 --> 00:09:41.349\nand they were eventually built.\n\n00:09:41.373 --> 00:09:42.880\nAnd currently, as of this year,\n\n00:09:42.904 --> 00:09:47.165\nthere are clinics rolling out\nin Nigeria and Kenya.\n\n00:09:48.934 --> 00:09:52.497\nFrom that, we also developed Siyathemba.\n\n00:09:52.521 --> 00:09:54.182\nThe community came to us and said,\n\n00:09:54.206 --> 00:09:57.229\n\"The problem is that the girls\ndon't have education.\"\n\n00:09:57.253 --> 00:09:58.603\nAnd we're working in an area\n\n00:09:58.627 --> 00:10:00.856\nwhere young women\nbetween the ages of 16 and 24\n\n00:10:00.880 --> 00:10:03.156\nhave a 50 percent HIV/AIDS rate.\n\n00:10:04.275 --> 00:10:07.037\nAnd that's not\nbecause they're promiscuous,\n\n00:10:07.061 --> 00:10:08.711\nit's because there's no knowledge.\n\n00:10:08.735 --> 00:10:11.734\nAnd so we decided to look\nat the idea of sports,\n\n00:10:11.758 --> 00:10:13.600\nand create a youth sports center\n\n00:10:13.624 --> 00:10:16.422\nthat doubled as an HIV/AIDS\noutreach center,\n\n00:10:16.446 --> 00:10:20.279\nand the coaches of the girls' team\nwere also trained doctors.\n\n00:10:20.303 --> 00:10:27.114\nSo that there would be a very slow way\nof developing confidence in health care.\n\n00:10:27.472 --> 00:10:29.917\nAnd we picked nine finalists,\n\n00:10:29.941 --> 00:10:33.750\nand then those nine finalists were\ndistributed throughout the entire region,\n\n00:10:33.774 --> 00:10:35.901\nand then the community\npicked their design.\n\n00:10:35.925 --> 00:10:37.853\nThey said, this is our design,\n\n00:10:37.877 --> 00:10:40.177\nbecause it's not only\nabout engaging a community;\n\n00:10:40.201 --> 00:10:41.895\nit's about empowering a community,\n\n00:10:41.919 --> 00:10:45.141\nand about getting them to be\na part of the rebuilding process.\n\n00:10:46.696 --> 00:10:48.978\nSo, the winning design is here.\n\n00:10:50.558 --> 00:10:52.621\nAnd then, of course,\nwe actually go and work\n\n00:10:52.645 --> 00:10:54.328\nwith the community and the clients.\n\n00:10:54.352 --> 00:10:55.550\nSo this is the designer.\n\n00:10:55.574 --> 00:10:58.527\nHe's out there working\nwith the first ever women's soccer team\n\n00:10:58.551 --> 00:11:01.448\nin KwaZulu-Natal, Siyathemba.\n\n00:11:01.829 --> 00:11:04.203\nAnd they can tell it better.\n\n00:11:04.972 --> 00:11:07.737\n(A cappella singing\nin a South African language)\n\n00:11:26.463 --> 00:11:28.448\nVideo: Well, my name is Cee Cee Mkhonza.\n\n00:11:28.472 --> 00:11:31.418\nI work at the Africa Centre,\nI'm an IT user consultant.\n\n00:11:31.442 --> 00:11:35.926\nI'm also the national football player\nfor South Africa, Banyana Banyana.\n\n00:11:35.950 --> 00:11:42.685\nAnd I also play in the Vodacom League,\nfor the team called Tembisa,\n\n00:11:42.709 --> 00:11:44.856\nwhich has now changed to Siyathemba.\n\n00:11:46.019 --> 00:11:48.316\nThis is our home ground.\n\n00:11:48.670 --> 00:11:52.409\nCameron Sinclair: I'm going to show that\nlater because I'm running out of time.\n\n00:11:52.433 --> 00:11:54.754\nI can see Chris looking at me slyly.\n\n00:11:54.778 --> 00:11:57.715\nThis was a connection,\njust a meeting with somebody\n\n00:11:57.739 --> 00:12:02.487\nwho wanted to develop Africa's first\ntelemedicine center, in Tanzania.\n\n00:12:02.511 --> 00:12:04.749\nAnd we met, literally,\na couple of months ago.\n\n00:12:04.773 --> 00:12:06.360\nWe've already developed a design.\n\n00:12:06.384 --> 00:12:08.591\nThe team is over there,\nworking in partnership.\n\n00:12:08.615 --> 00:12:11.899\nThis was a matchmaking,\nthanks to a couple of TEDsters --\n\n00:12:11.923 --> 00:12:15.473\nSun [Microsystems],\nCheryl Heller and Andrew Zolli,\n\n00:12:15.497 --> 00:12:17.856\nwho connected me\nwith this amazing African woman.\n\n00:12:17.880 --> 00:12:21.400\nAnd we start construction in June,\nand it will be opened by TEDGlobal.\n\n00:12:21.424 --> 00:12:23.876\nSo when you come to TEDGlobal,\nyou can check it out.\n\n00:12:24.495 --> 00:12:28.521\nBut what we're known probably most for\nis dealing with disasters and development,\n\n00:12:28.545 --> 00:12:30.584\nand we've been involved\nin a lot of issues,\n\n00:12:30.608 --> 00:12:36.795\nsuch as the tsunami\nand also things like Hurricane Katrina.\n\n00:12:36.819 --> 00:12:40.435\nThis is a 370-dollar shelter\nthat can be easily assembled.\n\n00:12:44.862 --> 00:12:49.838\nThis is a community-designed\ncommunity center.\n\n00:12:49.862 --> 00:12:53.758\nAnd what that means is we actually\nlive and work with the community,\n\n00:12:53.782 --> 00:12:55.905\nand they're part of the design process.\n\n00:12:58.254 --> 00:13:00.792\nThe kids actually get\ninvolved in mapping out\n\n00:13:00.816 --> 00:13:03.482\nwhere the community center should be.\n\n00:13:03.890 --> 00:13:07.357\nAnd then eventually, the community,\nthrough skills training,\n\n00:13:07.381 --> 00:13:09.498\nend up building the building with us.\n\n00:13:09.942 --> 00:13:11.665\nHere is another school.\n\n00:13:12.054 --> 00:13:16.669\nThis is what the UN gave these guys\nfor six months -- 12 plastic tarps.\n\n00:13:17.094 --> 00:13:18.349\nThis was in August.\n\n00:13:18.373 --> 00:13:21.397\nThis was the replacement;\nthat's supposed to last for two years.\n\n00:13:21.421 --> 00:13:23.723\nWhen the rain comes down,\nyou can't hear a thing,\n\n00:13:23.747 --> 00:13:26.061\nand in the summer,\nit's about 140 degrees inside.\n\n00:13:26.085 --> 00:13:29.534\nSo we said, if the rain's coming\ndown, let's get fresh water.\n\n00:13:29.558 --> 00:13:32.588\nSo every one of our schools\nhas a rainwater collection system.\n\n00:13:32.612 --> 00:13:39.114\nVery low cost: three classrooms\nand rainwater collection is 5,000 dollars.\n\n00:13:39.138 --> 00:13:43.380\nThis was raised by hot chocolate\nsales in Atlanta.\n\n00:13:44.269 --> 00:13:46.194\nIt's built by the parents of the kids.\n\n00:13:46.218 --> 00:13:48.845\nThe kids are out there on-site,\nbuilding the buildings.\n\n00:13:48.869 --> 00:13:50.630\nAnd it opened a couple of weeks ago,\n\n00:13:50.654 --> 00:13:53.233\nand there's 600 kids\nthat are now using the schools.\n\n00:13:53.257 --> 00:14:00.061\n(Applause)\n\n00:14:00.085 --> 00:14:02.127\nSo, disaster hits home.\n\n00:14:03.048 --> 00:14:07.777\nWe see the bad stories\non CNN and Fox and all that,\n\n00:14:07.801 --> 00:14:09.585\nbut we don't see the good stories.\n\n00:14:09.609 --> 00:14:13.728\nHere is a community that got together,\nand they said \"no\" to waiting.\n\n00:14:13.752 --> 00:14:16.998\nThey formed a partnership,\na diverse partnership of players,\n\n00:14:17.022 --> 00:14:19.133\nto actually map out East Biloxi,\n\n00:14:19.157 --> 00:14:21.021\nto figure out who's getting involved.\n\n00:14:21.045 --> 00:14:24.966\nWe've had over 1,500 volunteers\nrebuilding, rehabbing homes.\n\n00:14:25.558 --> 00:14:27.743\nFiguring out what FEMA regulations are,\n\n00:14:27.767 --> 00:14:31.592\nnot waiting for them to dictate\nto us how you should rebuild.\n\n00:14:31.616 --> 00:14:32.855\nWorking with residents,\n\n00:14:32.879 --> 00:14:36.294\ngetting them out of their homes,\nso they don't get ill.\n\n00:14:36.318 --> 00:14:38.462\nThis is what they're\ncleaning up on their own.\n\n00:14:39.941 --> 00:14:41.094\nDesigning housing.\n\n00:14:41.118 --> 00:14:43.235\nThis house is going in\nin a couple of weeks.\n\n00:14:43.259 --> 00:14:45.280\nThis is a rehabbed home,\ndone in four days.\n\n00:14:46.391 --> 00:14:50.534\nThis is a utility room\nfor a woman who is on a walker.\n\n00:14:50.558 --> 00:14:52.770\nShe's 70 years old.\nThis is what FEMA gave her.\n\n00:14:53.984 --> 00:14:56.597\n600 bucks, happened two days ago.\n\n00:14:56.958 --> 00:14:59.814\nWe put together, very quickly, a washroom.\n\n00:14:59.838 --> 00:15:02.831\nIt's built, it's running and she just\nstarted a business today,\n\n00:15:02.855 --> 00:15:04.878\nwhere she's washing\nother people's clothes.\n\n00:15:04.902 --> 00:15:08.534\nThese are the Calhouns.\n\n00:15:08.558 --> 00:15:12.550\nThey're photographers who had documented\nthe Lower Ninth for the last 40 years.\n\n00:15:12.899 --> 00:15:15.824\nThat was their home,\nand these are the photographs they took.\n\n00:15:15.848 --> 00:15:18.911\nAnd we're helping, working with them\nto create a new building.\n\n00:15:19.491 --> 00:15:20.689\nProjects we've done.\n\n00:15:21.141 --> 00:15:23.391\nProjects we've been a part of, support.\n\n00:15:23.938 --> 00:15:25.941\nWhy don't aid agencies do this?\n\n00:15:27.674 --> 00:15:29.007\nThis is the UN tent.\n\n00:15:30.364 --> 00:15:33.285\nThis is the new UN tent,\njust introduced this year.\n\n00:15:33.309 --> 00:15:34.788\nQuick to assemble.\n\n00:15:34.812 --> 00:15:37.088\nIt's got a flap -- that's the invention.\n\n00:15:38.384 --> 00:15:42.778\nIt took 20 years to design this\nand get it implemented in the field.\n\n00:15:42.802 --> 00:15:44.560\nI was 12 years old.\n\n00:15:45.726 --> 00:15:47.234\nThere's a problem here.\n\n00:15:48.686 --> 00:15:50.043\nLuckily, we're not alone.\n\n00:15:50.670 --> 00:15:53.534\nThere are hundreds and hundreds\nand hundreds and hundreds\n\n00:15:53.558 --> 00:15:57.534\nand hundreds of architects\nand designers and inventors\n\n00:15:57.558 --> 00:16:01.018\naround the world that are getting\ninvolved in humanitarian work.\n\n00:16:03.192 --> 00:16:06.232\nMore hemp houses -- it's a theme\nin Japan, apparently.\n\n00:16:06.256 --> 00:16:07.891\nI'm not sure what they're smoking.\n\n00:16:07.915 --> 00:16:09.525\n(Laughter)\n\n00:16:11.629 --> 00:16:14.336\nThis is a Grip Clip,\ndesigned by somebody who said,\n\n00:16:14.360 --> 00:16:17.367\n\"All you need is some way\nto attach membrane structures\n\n00:16:17.391 --> 00:16:20.687\nto physical support beams.\"\n\n00:16:22.900 --> 00:16:27.676\nThis guy designed for NASA,\nis now doing housing.\n\n00:16:28.272 --> 00:16:30.177\nI'm going to whip through this quickly,\n\n00:16:30.201 --> 00:16:32.628\nbecause I know I've got\nonly a couple of minutes.\n\n00:16:34.123 --> 00:16:36.268\nSo this is all done in the last two years.\n\n00:16:36.292 --> 00:16:38.919\nI showed you something\nthat took 20 years to do.\n\n00:16:38.943 --> 00:16:41.028\nAnd this is just a selection of things\n\n00:16:41.052 --> 00:16:43.707\nthat were built\nin the last couple of years.\n\n00:16:44.175 --> 00:16:45.957\nFrom Brazil to India,\n\n00:16:47.125 --> 00:16:48.276\nMexico,\n\n00:16:49.378 --> 00:16:50.531\nAlabama,\n\n00:16:53.284 --> 00:16:54.443\nChina,\n\n00:16:55.783 --> 00:16:56.937\nIsrael,\n\n00:16:56.961 --> 00:16:58.111\nPalestine,\n\n00:16:58.781 --> 00:16:59.931\nVietnam.\n\n00:17:00.264 --> 00:17:04.415\nThe average age of a designer\nwho gets involved in this project is 32 --\n\n00:17:04.439 --> 00:17:05.710\nthat's how old I am.\n\n00:17:05.734 --> 00:17:06.934\nSo it's a young --\n\n00:17:08.907 --> 00:17:11.555\nI just have to stop here,\nbecause Arup is in the room,\n\n00:17:11.579 --> 00:17:13.936\nand this is the best-designed\ntoilet in the world.\n\n00:17:13.960 --> 00:17:17.007\nIf you're ever, ever in India,\ngo use this toilet.\n\n00:17:17.031 --> 00:17:18.101\n(Laughter)\n\n00:17:18.125 --> 00:17:20.093\nChris Luebkeman will tell you why.\n\n00:17:20.558 --> 00:17:23.110\nI'm sure that's how he wanted\nto spend the party.\n\n00:17:28.506 --> 00:17:31.816\nBut the future is not going to be\nthe sky-scraping cities of New York,\n\n00:17:31.840 --> 00:17:32.991\nbut this.\n\n00:17:33.015 --> 00:17:35.101\nAnd when you look at this, you see crisis.\n\n00:17:35.125 --> 00:17:37.792\nWhat I see is many, many inventors.\n\n00:17:38.427 --> 00:17:40.562\nOne billion people live in abject poverty.\n\n00:17:40.586 --> 00:17:42.230\nWe hear about them all the time.\n\n00:17:42.254 --> 00:17:45.439\nFour billion live in growing\nbut fragile economies.\n\n00:17:46.638 --> 00:17:49.396\nOne in seven live\nin unplanned settlements.\n\n00:17:49.420 --> 00:17:52.570\nIf we do nothing about the housing crisis\nthat's about to happen,\n\n00:17:52.594 --> 00:17:56.149\nin 20 years, one in three people\nwill live in an unplanned settlement\n\n00:17:56.173 --> 00:17:57.436\nor a refugee camp.\n\n00:17:57.460 --> 00:18:00.173\nLook left, look right:\none of you will be there.\n\n00:18:01.038 --> 00:18:04.396\nHow do we improve the living standards\nof five billion people?\n\n00:18:04.824 --> 00:18:06.665\nWith 10 million solutions.\n\n00:18:07.134 --> 00:18:08.837\nSo I wish to develop a community\n\n00:18:08.861 --> 00:18:12.434\nthat actively embraces\ninnovative and sustainable design\n\n00:18:12.458 --> 00:18:15.431\nto improve the living\nconditions for everyone.\n\n00:18:15.455 --> 00:18:17.773\nChris Anderson: Wait a sec --\nthat's your wish?\n\n00:18:17.797 --> 00:18:18.948\nCS: That's my wish.\n\n00:18:18.972 --> 00:18:20.123\nCA: That's his wish!\n\n00:18:20.147 --> 00:18:26.670\n(Applause)\n\n00:18:33.261 --> 00:18:37.110\nCS: We started Architecture for Humanity\nwith 700 dollars and a website.\n\n00:18:37.665 --> 00:18:41.384\nSo Chris somehow decided\nto give me 100,000.\n\n00:18:41.741 --> 00:18:43.566\nSo why not this many people?\n\n00:18:44.941 --> 00:18:47.386\nOpen-source architecture is the way to go.\n\n00:18:47.410 --> 00:18:50.497\nYou have a diverse community\nof participants --\n\n00:18:50.521 --> 00:18:53.394\nand we're not just talking\nabout inventors and designers,\n\n00:18:53.418 --> 00:18:55.537\nbut we're talking about the funding model.\n\n00:18:55.561 --> 00:18:57.339\nMy role is not as a designer;\n\n00:18:57.363 --> 00:19:00.848\nit's as a conduit between the design world\nand the humanitarian world.\n\n00:19:00.872 --> 00:19:05.626\nAnd what we need is something\nthat replicates me globally,\n\n00:19:05.650 --> 00:19:07.994\nbecause I haven't slept in seven years.\n\n00:19:08.018 --> 00:19:10.534\n(Laughter)\n\n00:19:10.558 --> 00:19:13.387\nSecondly, what will this thing be?\n\n00:19:13.411 --> 00:19:17.291\nDesigners want to respond\nto issues of humanitarian crisis,\n\n00:19:17.315 --> 00:19:20.266\nbut they don't want\nsome company in the West\n\n00:19:20.290 --> 00:19:22.941\ntaking their idea\nand basically profiting from it.\n\n00:19:22.965 --> 00:19:27.114\nSo Creative Commons has developed\nthe Developing Nations license.\n\n00:19:27.138 --> 00:19:29.528\nAnd what that means\nis that a designer can --\n\n00:19:29.552 --> 00:19:31.385\nThe Siyathemba project I showed\n\n00:19:31.409 --> 00:19:35.377\nwas the first ever building to have\na Creative Commons license on it.\n\n00:19:35.401 --> 00:19:40.534\nAs soon as that is built, anyone\nin Africa or any developing nation\n\n00:19:40.558 --> 00:19:43.751\ncan take the construction documents\nand replicate it for free.\n\n00:19:45.615 --> 00:19:50.167\n(Applause)\n\n00:19:50.191 --> 00:19:53.110\nSo why not allow designers\nthe opportunity to do this,\n\n00:19:53.134 --> 00:19:55.412\nbut still protect their rights here?\n\n00:19:55.436 --> 00:19:59.441\nWe want to have a community\nwhere you can upload ideas,\n\n00:19:59.465 --> 00:20:03.665\nand those ideas can be tested\nin an earthquake, in flood,\n\n00:20:03.689 --> 00:20:06.009\nin all sorts of austere environments.\n\n00:20:06.033 --> 00:20:07.770\nThe reason that's important\n\n00:20:07.794 --> 00:20:09.851\nis I don't want to wait\nfor the next Katrina\n\n00:20:09.875 --> 00:20:11.484\nto find out if my house works.\n\n00:20:12.630 --> 00:20:15.106\nThat's too late, we need to do it now.\n\n00:20:15.130 --> 00:20:16.464\nSo doing that globally --\n\n00:20:16.488 --> 00:20:21.978\nand I want this whole thing\nto work multi-lingually.\n\n00:20:22.002 --> 00:20:26.085\nWhen you look at the face of an architect,\nmost people think a gray-haired white guy.\n\n00:20:26.109 --> 00:20:28.476\nI don't see that;\nI see the face of the world.\n\n00:20:28.848 --> 00:20:30.908\nSo I want everyone\nfrom all over the planet\n\n00:20:30.932 --> 00:20:34.534\nto be able to be a part\nof this design and development.\n\n00:20:34.900 --> 00:20:36.949\nThe idea of needs-based competitions --\n\n00:20:36.973 --> 00:20:40.374\nXPRIZE for the other 98 percent,\nif you want to call it that.\n\n00:20:41.707 --> 00:20:44.001\nWe also want to look\nat ways of matchmaking\n\n00:20:44.025 --> 00:20:46.142\nand putting funding partners together,\n\n00:20:46.166 --> 00:20:48.508\nand the idea of integrating\nmanufacturers --\n\n00:20:48.532 --> 00:20:50.127\nfab labs in every country.\n\n00:20:50.151 --> 00:20:53.966\nWhen I hear about the $100 laptop\nand it's going to educate every child

you know what?\nInnovation will happen.\n\n00:21:02.811 --> 00:21:05.193\nAnd I need to know that.\nIt's called the leap-back.\n\n00:21:05.217 --> 00:21:07.347\nWe talk about leapfrog technologies.\n\n00:21:07.371 --> 00:21:08.752\nI write with Worldchanging,\n\n00:21:08.776 --> 00:21:10.929\nand the one thing\nwe've been talking about is,\n\n00:21:10.953 --> 00:21:13.540\nI learn more on the ground\nthan I've ever learned here.\n\n00:21:13.564 --> 00:21:16.716\nSo let's take those ideas,\nadapt them, and we can use them.\n\n00:21:19.386 --> 00:21:22.807\nThese ideas are supposed to be adaptable;\n\n00:21:22.831 --> 00:21:26.568\nthey should have\nthe potential for evolution;\n\n00:21:26.592 --> 00:21:29.088\nthey should be developed\nby every nation in the world\n\n00:21:29.112 --> 00:21:31.208\nand useful for every nation in the world.\n\n00:21:31.795 --> 00:21:32.952\nWhat will it take?\n\n00:21:33.388 --> 00:21:34.562\nThere should be a sheet.\n\n00:21:34.586 --> 00:21:38.094\nI don't have time to read this,\nbecause I'm going to be yanked off.\n\n00:21:38.118 --> 00:21:40.388\nCA: Let's just leave it up for a sec.\n\n00:21:40.412 --> 00:21:42.838\nCS: Well, what will it take?\nYou guys are smart.\n\n00:21:44.052 --> 00:21:46.916\nSo it's going to take a lot\nof computing power,\n\n00:21:46.940 --> 00:21:50.039\nbecause I want the idea\nthat any laptop anywhere in the world\n\n00:21:50.063 --> 00:21:51.434\ncan plug into the system\n\n00:21:51.458 --> 00:21:55.020\nand be able to not only participate\nin developing these designs,\n\n00:21:55.044 --> 00:21:56.799\nbut utilize the designs.\n\n00:21:56.823 --> 00:22:00.580\nAlso, a process of reviewing the designs.\n\n00:22:00.604 --> 00:22:04.016\nI want every Arup engineer\nin the world to check and make sure\n\n00:22:04.040 --> 00:22:05.909\nthat we're doing stuff that's standing,\n\n00:22:05.933 --> 00:22:08.074\nbecause those guys\nare the best in the world.\n\n00:22:08.098 --> 00:22:09.248\nPlug.\n\n00:22:09.867 --> 00:22:13.424\nAnd so, you know, I want these --\n\n00:22:13.448 --> 00:22:17.202\nI just should note: I have two laptops\nand one of them is there,\n\n00:22:17.226 --> 00:22:19.709\nand that has 3000 designs on it.\n\n00:22:19.733 --> 00:22:22.686\nIf I drop that laptop ...\n\n00:22:22.710 --> 00:22:24.160\nWhat happens?\n\n00:22:24.184 --> 00:22:27.152\nSo it's important to have\nthese proven ideas put up there,\n\n00:22:27.176 --> 00:22:29.025\neasy to use, easy to get ahold of.\n\n00:22:33.002 --> 00:22:36.777\nMy mom once said, \"There's nothing worse\nthan being all mouth and no trousers.\"\n\n00:22:36.801 --> 00:22:38.308\n(Laughter)\n\n00:22:38.332 --> 00:22:41.483\nI'm fed up of talking about making change.\n\n00:22:41.507 --> 00:22:43.356\nYou only make it by doing it.\n\n00:22:43.801 --> 00:22:47.381\nWe've changed FEMA guidelines;\nwe've changed public policy;\n\n00:22:47.405 --> 00:22:51.819\nwe've changed international response --\nbased on building things.\n\n00:22:51.843 --> 00:22:56.192\nSo for me, it's important that we create\na real conduit for innovation,\n\n00:22:56.216 --> 00:22:57.860\nand that it's free innovation.\n\n00:22:57.884 --> 00:23:00.507\nThink of free culture --\nthis is free innovation.\n\n00:23:02.816 --> 00:23:05.604\nSomebody said this a couple of years back.\n\n00:23:07.096 --> 00:23:09.233\nI will give points for those who know it.\n\n00:23:09.257 --> 00:23:15.518\nBut I think the man was maybe\n25 years too early.\n\n00:23:15.542 --> 00:23:17.767\nSo let's do it.\n\n00:23:17.791 --> 00:23:18.944\nThank you.\n\n00:23:18.968 --> 00:23:22.950\n(Applause)"}, {"title": "My wish: A global day of film", "duration": "1538", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/jehane_noujaim_inspires_a_global_day_of_film", "transcript": "I can't help but this wish: to think about when you're a little kid, and all your friends ask you, \"If a genie could give you one wish in the world, what would it be?\" And I always answered, \"Well, I'd want the wish to have the wisdom to know exactly what to wish for.\" Well, then you'd be screwed, because you'd know what to wish for, and you'd use up your wish, and now, since we only have one wish \u2014 unlike last year they had three wishes \u2014 I'm not going to wish for that.So let's get to what I would like, which is world peace. And I know what you're thinking: You're thinking, \"The poor girl up there, she thinks she's at a beauty pageant. She's not. She's at the TED Prize.\" (Laughter) But I really do think it makes sense. And I think that the first step to world peace is for people to meet each other. I've met a lot of different people over the years, and I've filmed some of them, from a dotcom executive in New York who wanted to take over the world, to a military press officer in Qatar, who would rather not take over the world. If you've seen the film \"Control Room\" that was sent out, you'd understand a little bit why. (Applause) Thank you. Wow! Some of you watched it. That's great. That's great.So basically what I'd like to talk about today is a way for people to travel, to meet people in a different way than \u2014 because you can't travel all over the world at the same time. And a long time ago \u2014 well, about 40 years ago \u2014 my mom had an exchange student. And I'm going to show you slides of the exchange student. This is Donna. This is Donna at the Statue of Liberty. This is my mother and aunt teaching Donna how to ride a bike. This is Donna eating ice cream. And this is Donna teaching my aunt how to do a Filipino dance. I really think as the world is getting smaller, it becomes more and more important that we learn each other's dance moves, that we meet each other, we get to know each other, we are able to figure out a way to cross borders, to understand each other, to understand people's hopes and dreams, what makes them laugh and cry. And I know that we can't all do exchange programs, and I can't force everybody to travel; I've already talked about that to Chris and Amy, and they said that there's a problem with this: You can't force people, free will. And I totally support that, so we're not forcing people to travel. But I'd like to talk about another way to travel that doesn't require a ship or an airplane, and just requires a movie camera, a projector and a screen. And that's what I'm going to talk to you about today.I was asked that I speak a little bit about where I personally come from, and Cameron, I don't know how you managed to get out of that one, but I think that building bridges is important to me because of where I come from. I'm the daughter of an American mother and an Egyptian-Lebanese-Syrian father. So I'm the living product of two cultures coming together. No pun intended. (Laughter) And I've also been called, as an Egyptian-Lebanese-Syrian American with a Persian name, the \"Middle East Peace Crisis.\"So maybe me starting to take pictures was some kind of way to bring both sides of my family together \u2014 a way to take the worlds with me, a way to tell stories visually. It all kind of started that way, but I think that I really realized the power of the image when I first went to the garbage-collecting village in Egypt, when I was about 16. My mother took me there. She's somebody who believes strongly in community service, and decided that this was something that I needed to do. And so I went there and I met some amazing women there. There was a center there, where they were teaching people how to read and write, and get vaccinations against the many diseases you can get from sorting through garbage. And I began teaching there. I taught English, and I met some incredible women there. I met people that live seven people to a room, barely can afford their evening meal, yet lived with this strength of spirit and sense of humor and just incredible qualities.I got drawn into this community and I began to take pictures there. I took pictures of weddings and older family members \u2014 things that they wanted memories of. About two years after I started taking these pictures, the UN Conference on Population and Development asked me to show them at the conference. So I was 18; I was very excited. It was my first exhibit of photographs and they were all put up there, and after about two days, they all came down except for three. People were very upset, very angry that I was showing these dirty sides of Cairo, and why didn't I cut the dead donkey out of the frame? And as I sat there, I got very depressed. I looked at this big empty wall with three lonely photographs that were, you know, very pretty photographs and I was like, \"I failed at this.\" But I was looking at this intense emotion and intense feeling that had come out of people just seeing these photographs. Here I was, this 18-year-old pipsqueak that nobody listened to, and all of a sudden, I put these photographs on the wall, and there were arguments, and they had to be taken down. And I saw the power of the image, and it was incredible. And I think the most important reaction that I saw there was actually from people that would never have gone to the garbage village themselves, that would never have seen that the human spirit could thrive in such difficult circumstances. And I think it was at that point that I decided I wanted to use photography and film to somehow bridge gaps, to bridge cultures, bring people together, cross borders. And so that's what really kind of started me off.Did a stint at MTV, made a film called \"Startup.com,\" and I've done a couple of music films. But in 2003, when the war in Iraq was about to start, it was a very surreal feeling for me, because before the war started, there was kind of this media war that was going on. And I was watching television in New York, and there seemed to be just one point of view that was coming across, and the coverage went from the US State Department to embedded troops. And what was coming across on the news was that there was going to be this clean war and precision bombings, and the Iraqis would be greeting the Americans as liberators, and throwing flowers at their feet in the streets of Baghdad. And I knew that there was a completely other story that was taking place in the Middle East, where my parents were. I knew that there was a completely other story being told, and I was thinking, \"How are people supposed to communicate with each other when they're getting completely different messages, and nobody knows what the other's being told? How are people supposed to have any kind of common understanding or know how to move together into the future? So I knew that I had to go there. I just wanted to be in the center. I had no plan. I had no funding. I didn't even have a camera at the time \u2014 I had somebody bring it there, because I wanted to get access to Al Jazeera, George Bush's favorite channel, and a place which I was very curious about because it's disliked by many governments across the Arab world, and also called the mouthpiece of Osama Bin Laden by some people in the US government.So I was thinking, this station that's hated by so many people has to be doing something right. I've got to go see what this is all about. And I also wanted to go see Central Command, which was 10 minutes away. And that way, I could get access to how this news was being created \u2014 on the Arab side, reaching the Arab world, and on the US and Western side, reaching the US.And when I went there and sat there, and met these people that were in the center of it, and sat with these characters, I met some surprising, very complex people. And I'd like to share with you a little bit of that experience of when you sit with somebody and you film them, and you listen to them, and you allow them more than a five-second sound bite. The amazing complexity of people emerges.Samir Khader: Business as usual. Iraq, and then Iraq, and then Iraq. But between us, if I'm offered a job with Fox, I'll take it. To change the Arab nightmare into the American dream. I still have that dream. Maybe I will never be able to do it, but I have plans for my children. When they finish high school, I will send them to America to study there. I will pay for their study. And they will stay there. Josh Rushing: The night they showed the POWs and the dead soldiers \u2014 Al Jazeera showed them \u2014 it was powerful, because America doesn't show those kinds of images. Most of the news in America won't show really gory images and this showed American soldiers in uniform, strewn about a floor, a cold tile floor. And it was revolting. It was absolutely revolting. It made me sick at my stomach. And then what hit me was, the night before, there had been some kind of bombing in Basra, and Al Jazeera had shown images of the people. And they were equally, if not more, horrifying \u2014 the images were. And I remember having seen it in the Al Jazeera office, and thought to myself, \"Wow, that's gross. That's bad.\" And then going away, and probably eating dinner or something. And it didn't affect me as much. So, the impact that had on me \u2014 me realizing that I just saw people on the other side, and those people in the Al Jazeera office must have felt the way I was feeling that night, and it upset me on a profound level that I wasn't as bothered as much the night before. It makes me hate war. But it doesn't make me believe that we're in a world that can live without war yet.Jehane Noujaim: I was overwhelmed by the response of the film. We didn't know whether it would be able to get out there. We had no funding for it. We were incredibly lucky that it got picked up. And when we showed the film in both the United States and the Arab world, we had such incredible reactions. It was amazing to see how people were moved by this film. In the Arab world \u2014 and it's not really by the film, it's by the characters \u2014 I mean, Josh Rushing was this incredibly complex person who was thinking about things. And when I showed the film in the Middle East, people wanted to meet Josh. He kind of redefined us as an American population. People started to ask me, \"Where is this guy now?\" Al Jazeera offered him a job. (Laughter) And Samir, on the other hand, was also quite an interesting character for the Arab world to see, because it brought out the complexities of this love-hate relationship that the Arab world has with the West.In the United States, I was blown away by the motivations, the positive motivations of the American people when they'd see this film. You know, we're criticized abroad for believing we're the saviors of the world in some way, but the flip side of it is that, actually, when people do see what is happening abroad and people's reactions to some of our policy abroad, we feel this power, that we need to \u2014 we feel like we have to get the power to change things. And I saw this with audiences. This woman came up to me after the screening and said, \"You know, I know this is crazy. I saw the bombs being loaded on the planes, I saw the military going out to war, but you don't understand people's anger towards us until you see the people in the hospitals and the victims of the war, and how do we get out of this bubble?How do we understand what the other person is thinking?\" Now, I don't know whether a film can change the world. But I know the power of it, I know that it starts people thinking about how to change the world.Now, I'm not a philosopher, so I feel like I shouldn't go into great depth on this, but let film speak for itself and take you to this other world. Because I believe that film has the ability to take you across borders, I'd like you to just sit back and experience for a couple of minutes being taken into another world. And these couple clips take you inside of two of the most difficult conflicts that we're faced with today. [The last 48 hours of two Palestinian suicide bombers.] [Paradise Now][Man: As long as there is injustice, someone must make a sacrifice!][Woman: That's no sacrifice, that's revenge!] [If you kill, there's no difference between victim and occupier.][Man: If we had airplanes, we wouldn't need martyrs, that's the difference.][Woman: The difference is that the Israeli military is still stronger.][Man: Then let us be equal in death.] [We still have Paradise.][Woman: There is no Paradise! It only exists in your head!][Man: God forbid!] [May God forgive you.] [If you were not Abu Azzam's daughter ...] [Anyway, I'd rather have Paradise in my head than live in this hell!] [In this life, we're dead anyway.][One only chooses bitterness when the alternative is even bitterer.][Woman: And what about us? The ones who remain?] [Will we win that way?] [Don't you see what you're doing is destroying us?] [And that you give Israel an alibi to carry on?][Man: So with no alibi, Israel will stop?][Woman: Perhaps. We have to turn it into a moral war.][Man: How, if Israel has no morals?][Woman: Be careful!] [And the real people building peace through non-violence] [Encounter Point] Video: (Ambulance siren) [Tel Aviv, Israel 1996][Tzvika: My wife Ayelet called me and said, ] [\"There was a suicide bombing in Tel Aviv.\"][Ayelet: What do you know about the casualties?] [Tzvika off-screen: We're looking for three girls.][We have no information.][Ayelet: One is wounded here, but we haven't heard from the other three.][Tzvika: I said, \"OK, that's Bat-Chen, that's my daughter.] [Are you sure she is dead?\"] [They said yes.] Video: (Police siren and shouting over megaphone) [Bethlehem, Occupied Palestinian Territories, 2003][George: On that day, at around 6:30] [I was driving with my wife and daughters to the supermarket.] [When we got to here ...] [we saw three Israeli military jeeps parked on the side of the road.] [When we passed by the first jeep ...] [they opened fire on us.] [And my 12-year-old daughter Christine] [was killed in the shooting.] [Bereaved Families Forum, Jerusalem][Tzvika: I'm the headmaster for all parts.][George: But there is a teacher that is in charge?] [Tzvika: Yes, I have assistants.] [I deal with children all the time.] [One year after their daughters' deaths both Tzvika and George join the forum][George: At first, I thought it was a strange idea.] [But after thinking logically about it, ] [I didn't find any reason why not to meet them] [and let them know of our suffering.][Tzvika: There were many things that touched me.] [We see that there are Palestinians who suffered a lot, who lost children,] [and still believe in the peace process and in reconciliation.] [If we who lost what is most precious can talk to each other,] [and look forward to a better future,] [then everyone else must do so, too.] [From South Africa: A Revolution Through Music] [Amandla] (Music)(Video) Man: Song is something that we communicated with people who otherwise would not have understood where we're coming from. You could give them a long political speech, they would still not understand. But I tell you, when you finish that song, people will be like, \"Damn, I know where you niggas are coming from. I know where you guys are coming from. Death unto apartheid!\"Narrator: It's about the liberation struggle. It's about those children who took to the streets \u2014 fighting, screaming, \"Free Nelson Mandela!\" It's about those unions who put down their tools and demanded freedom. Yes. Yes! (Music and singing) (Singing) Freedom! (Applause)Jehane Noujaim: I think everybody's had that feeling of sitting in a theater, in a dark room, with other strangers, watching a very powerful film, and they felt that feeling of transformation. And what I'd like to talk about is how can we use that feeling to actually create a movement through film? I've been listening to the talks in the conference, and Robert Wright said yesterday that if we have an appreciation for another person's humanity, then they will have an appreciation for ours. And that's what this is about. It's about connecting people through film, getting these independent voices out there. Now, Josh Rushing actually ended up leaving the military and taking a job with Al Jazeera. (Laughter) So his feeling is that he's at Al Jazeera International because he feels like he can actually use media to bridge the gap between East and West. And that's an amazing thing. But I've been trying to think about ways to give power to these independent voices, to give power to the filmmakers, to give power to people who are trying to use film for change. And there are incredible organizations that are out there doing this already. There's Witness, that you heard from earlier. There's Just Vision, that are working with Palestinians and Israelis who are working together for peace, and documenting that process and getting interviews out there and using this film to take to Congress to show that it's a powerful tool, to show that this is a woman who's had her daughter killed in an attack, and she believes that there are peaceful ways to solve this. There's Working Films and there's Current TV, which is an incredible platform for people around the world to be able to put their \u2014 (Applause) Yeah, it's amazing. I've watched it and I'm blown away by it and its potential to bring voices from around the world \u2014 independent voices from around the world \u2014 and create a truly democratic, global television.So what can we do to create a platform for these organizations, to create some momentum, to get everybody in the world involved in this movement? I'd like for us to imagine for a second. Imagine a day when you have everyone coming together from around the world. You have towns and villages and theaters \u2014 all from around the world, getting together, and sitting in the dark, and sharing a communal experience of watching a film, or a couple of films, together. Watching a film which maybe highlights a character that is fighting to live, or just a character that defies stereotypes, makes a joke, sings a song. Comedies, documentaries, shorts. This amazing power can be used to change people and to bond people together; to cross borders, and have people feel like they're having a communal experience. So if you imagine this day when all around the world, you have theaters and places where we project films. If you imagine projecting from Times Square to Tahrir Square in Cairo, the same film in Ramallah, the same film in Jerusalem. You know, we've been talking to a friend of mine about using the side of the Great Pyramid and the Great Wall of China. It's endless what you can imagine, in terms of where you can project films and where you can have this communal experience. And I believe that this one day, if we can create it, this one day can create momentum for all of these independent voices. There isn't an organization which is connecting the independent voices of the world to get out there, and yet I'm hearing throughout this conference that the biggest challenge in our future is understanding the other, and having mutual respect for the other and crossing borders. And if film can do that, and if we can get all of these different locations in the world to watch these films together \u2014 this could be an incredible day.So we've already made a partnership, set up through somebody from the TED community, John Camen, who introduced me to Steven Apkon, from the Jacob Burns Film Center. And we started calling up everybody. And in the last week, there have been so many people that have responded to us, from as close as Palo Alto, to Mongolia and to India. There are people that want to be a part of this global day of film; to be able to provide a platform for independent voices and independent films to get out there. Now, we've thought about a name for this day, and I'd like to share this with you. Now, the most amazing part of this whole process has been sharing ideas and wishes, and so I invite you to give brainstorms onto how does this day echo into the future? How do we use technology to make this day echo into the future, so that we can build community and have these communities working together, through the Internet? There was a time, many, many years ago, when all of the continents were stuck together. And we call that landmass Pangea. So what we'd like to call this day of film is Pangea Cinema Day. And if you just imagine that all of these people in these towns would be watching, then I think that we can actually really make a movement towards people understanding each other better.I know that it's very intangible, touching people's hearts and souls, but the only way that I know how to do it, the only way that I know how to reach out to somebody's heart and soul all across the world, is by showing them a film. And I know that there are independent filmmakers and films out there that can really make this happen. And that's my wish. I guess I'm supposed to give you my one-sentence wish, but we're way out of time.Chris Anderson: That is an incredible wish. Pangea Cinema: The day the world comes together.JN: It's more tangible than world peace, and it's certainly more immediate. But it would be the day that the world comes together through film, the power of film.CA: Ladies and gentlemen, Jehane Noujaim.", "id": 55, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:12.188 --> 00:00:13.517\nI can't help but this wish:\n\n00:00:13.541 --> 00:00:17.974\nto think about when you're a little kid,\nand all your friends ask you,\n\n00:00:17.998 --> 00:00:20.586\n\"If a genie could give you\none wish in the world,\n\n00:00:20.610 --> 00:00:21.764\nwhat would it be?\"\n\n00:00:22.141 --> 00:00:23.530\nAnd I always answered,\n\n00:00:23.554 --> 00:00:24.864\n\"Well, I'd want the wish\n\n00:00:24.888 --> 00:00:28.376\nto have the wisdom to know\nexactly what to wish for.\"\n\n00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:30.081\nWell, then you'd be screwed,\n\n00:00:30.105 --> 00:00:33.120\nbecause you'd know what to wish for,\nand you'd use up your wish,\n\n00:00:33.144 --> 00:00:36.967\nand now, since we only have one wish --\nunlike last year they had three wishes --\n\n00:00:36.991 --> 00:00:38.477\nI'm not going to wish for that.\n\n00:00:38.501 --> 00:00:43.504\nSo let's get to what I would like,\nwhich is world peace.\n\n00:00:43.528 --> 00:00:45.560\nAnd I know what you're thinking:\n\n00:00:45.584 --> 00:00:47.548\nYou're thinking, \"The poor girl up there,\n\n00:00:47.572 --> 00:00:49.349\nshe thinks she's at a beauty pageant.\n\n00:00:49.373 --> 00:00:51.624\nShe's not. She's at the TED Prize.\"\n\n00:00:51.648 --> 00:00:54.234\n(Laughter)\n\n00:00:54.782 --> 00:00:56.821\nBut I really do think it makes sense.\n\n00:00:57.202 --> 00:00:59.797\nAnd I think that\nthe first step to world peace\n\n00:00:59.821 --> 00:01:01.641\nis for people to meet each other.\n\n00:01:01.665 --> 00:01:04.153\nI've met a lot of different\npeople over the years,\n\n00:01:04.177 --> 00:01:05.579\nand I've filmed some of them,\n\n00:01:05.603 --> 00:01:10.499\nfrom a dotcom executive in New York\nwho wanted to take over the world,\n\n00:01:10.523 --> 00:01:12.934\nto a military press officer in Qatar,\n\n00:01:12.958 --> 00:01:15.463\nwho would rather not take over the world.\n\n00:01:15.487 --> 00:01:18.172\nIf you've seen the film\n\"Control Room\" that was sent out,\n\n00:01:18.196 --> 00:01:19.821\nyou'd understand a little bit why.\n\n00:01:19.845 --> 00:01:20.996\n(Applause)\n\n00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:22.178\nThank you.\n\n00:01:22.202 --> 00:01:25.474\nWow! Some of you watched it.\nThat's great. That's great.\n\n00:01:25.498 --> 00:01:30.068\nSo basically what I'd like\nto talk about today\n\n00:01:30.092 --> 00:01:32.934\nis a way for people to travel,\n\n00:01:32.958 --> 00:01:36.934\nto meet people in a different way than --\n\n00:01:36.958 --> 00:01:39.934\nbecause you can't travel\nall over the world at the same time.\n\n00:01:39.958 --> 00:01:45.194\nAnd a long time ago --\nwell, about 40 years ago --\n\n00:01:45.218 --> 00:01:47.744\nmy mom had an exchange student.\n\n00:01:48.855 --> 00:01:51.673\nAnd I'm going to show you\nslides of the exchange student.\n\n00:01:51.697 --> 00:01:52.848\nThis is Donna.\n\n00:01:52.872 --> 00:01:54.903\nThis is Donna at the Statue of Liberty.\n\n00:01:56.404 --> 00:01:59.424\nThis is my mother and aunt\nteaching Donna how to ride a bike.\n\n00:02:00.496 --> 00:02:02.409\nThis is Donna eating ice cream.\n\n00:02:03.242 --> 00:02:07.555\nAnd this is Donna teaching my aunt\nhow to do a Filipino dance.\n\n00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:12.057\nI really think as the world\nis getting smaller,\n\n00:02:12.081 --> 00:02:13.724\nit becomes more and more important\n\n00:02:13.748 --> 00:02:15.610\nthat we learn each other's dance moves,\n\n00:02:15.634 --> 00:02:18.040\nthat we meet each other,\nwe get to know each other,\n\n00:02:18.064 --> 00:02:21.703\nwe are able to figure out\na way to cross borders,\n\n00:02:21.727 --> 00:02:24.851\nto understand each other, to understand\npeople's hopes and dreams,\n\n00:02:24.875 --> 00:02:26.331\nwhat makes them laugh and cry.\n\n00:02:26.355 --> 00:02:29.376\nAnd I know that we can't\nall do exchange programs,\n\n00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:31.225\nand I can't force everybody to travel;\n\n00:02:31.249 --> 00:02:33.568\nI've already talked about that\nto Chris and Amy,\n\n00:02:33.592 --> 00:02:35.794\nand they said that\nthere's a problem with this:\n\n00:02:35.818 --> 00:02:37.553\nYou can't force people, free will.\n\n00:02:37.577 --> 00:02:40.684\nAnd I totally support that,\nso we're not forcing people to travel.\n\n00:02:40.708 --> 00:02:42.962\nBut I'd like to talk\nabout another way to travel\n\n00:02:42.986 --> 00:02:45.934\nthat doesn't require\na ship or an airplane,\n\n00:02:45.958 --> 00:02:50.934\nand just requires a movie camera,\na projector and a screen.\n\n00:02:50.958 --> 00:02:55.791\nAnd that's what I'm going\nto talk to you about today.\n\n00:02:55.815 --> 00:03:00.546\nI was asked that I speak a little bit\nabout where I personally come from,\n\n00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:03.673\nand Cameron, I don't know how\nyou managed to get out of that one,\n\n00:03:03.697 --> 00:03:07.934\nbut I think that building bridges\nis important to me\n\n00:03:07.958 --> 00:03:10.105\nbecause of where I come from.\n\n00:03:10.129 --> 00:03:13.508\nI'm the daughter of an American mother\n\n00:03:13.532 --> 00:03:16.643\nand an Egyptian-Lebanese-Syrian father.\n\n00:03:16.667 --> 00:03:20.739\nSo I'm the living product\nof two cultures coming together.\n\n00:03:20.763 --> 00:03:21.915\nNo pun intended.\n\n00:03:21.939 --> 00:03:22.946\n(Laughter)\n\n00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:24.227\nAnd I've also been called,\n\n00:03:24.251 --> 00:03:27.100\nas an Egyptian-Lebanese-Syrian American\nwith a Persian name,\n\n00:03:27.124 --> 00:03:29.014\nthe \"Middle East Peace Crisis.\"\n\n00:03:29.038 --> 00:03:33.514\nSo maybe me starting to take\npictures was some kind of way\n\n00:03:33.538 --> 00:03:36.990\nto bring both sides\nof my family together --\n\n00:03:37.014 --> 00:03:41.839\na way to take the worlds with me,\na way to tell stories visually.\n\n00:03:42.411 --> 00:03:44.007\nIt all kind of started that way,\n\n00:03:44.031 --> 00:03:47.627\nbut I think that I really realized\nthe power of the image\n\n00:03:47.651 --> 00:03:50.863\nwhen I first went\nto the garbage-collecting village\n\n00:03:50.887 --> 00:03:52.887\nin Egypt, when I was about 16.\n\n00:03:53.284 --> 00:03:55.458\nMy mother took me there.\n\n00:03:55.863 --> 00:03:58.622\nShe's somebody who believes strongly\nin community service,\n\n00:03:58.646 --> 00:04:01.289\nand decided that this was something\nthat I needed to do.\n\n00:04:01.313 --> 00:04:04.934\nAnd so I went there and I met\nsome amazing women there.\n\n00:04:04.958 --> 00:04:07.888\nThere was a center there,\n\n00:04:07.912 --> 00:04:10.950\nwhere they were teaching\npeople how to read and write,\n\n00:04:10.974 --> 00:04:13.188\nand get vaccinations\nagainst the many diseases\n\n00:04:13.212 --> 00:04:15.307\nyou can get from sorting through garbage.\n\n00:04:15.331 --> 00:04:16.896\nAnd I began teaching there.\n\n00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:19.934\nI taught English, and I met\nsome incredible women there.\n\n00:04:19.958 --> 00:04:24.746\nI met people that live\nseven people to a room,\n\n00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:27.102\nbarely can afford their evening meal,\n\n00:04:27.126 --> 00:04:30.649\nyet lived with this strength\nof spirit and sense of humor\n\n00:04:30.673 --> 00:04:33.355\nand just incredible qualities.\n\n00:04:33.379 --> 00:04:37.133\nI got drawn into this community\nand I began to take pictures there.\n\n00:04:37.157 --> 00:04:43.934\nI took pictures of weddings\nand older family members --\n\n00:04:43.958 --> 00:04:46.067\nthings that they wanted memories of.\n\n00:04:47.099 --> 00:04:50.504\nAbout two years after I started\ntaking these pictures,\n\n00:04:50.528 --> 00:04:54.934\nthe UN Conference\non Population and Development\n\n00:04:54.958 --> 00:04:57.854\nasked me to show them at the conference.\n\n00:04:57.878 --> 00:05:00.826\nSo I was 18; I was very excited.\n\n00:05:00.850 --> 00:05:06.207\nIt was my first exhibit of photographs\nand they were all put up there,\n\n00:05:06.231 --> 00:05:12.196\nand after about two days,\nthey all came down except for three.\n\n00:05:12.747 --> 00:05:14.597\nPeople were very upset,\n\n00:05:14.621 --> 00:05:18.231\nvery angry that I was showing\nthese dirty sides of Cairo,\n\n00:05:18.255 --> 00:05:21.712\nand why didn't I cut\nthe dead donkey out of the frame?\n\n00:05:21.736 --> 00:05:23.973\nAnd as I sat there, I got very depressed.\n\n00:05:23.997 --> 00:05:29.595\nI looked at this big empty wall\nwith three lonely photographs\n\n00:05:29.619 --> 00:05:33.873\nthat were, you know,\nvery pretty photographs\n\n00:05:33.897 --> 00:05:36.788\nand I was like, \"I failed at this.\"\n\n00:05:36.812 --> 00:05:41.935\nBut I was looking at this intense\nemotion and intense feeling\n\n00:05:41.959 --> 00:05:45.412\nthat had come out of people\njust seeing these photographs.\n\n00:05:45.436 --> 00:05:48.417\nHere I was, this 18-year-old pipsqueak\nthat nobody listened to,\n\n00:05:48.441 --> 00:05:51.219\nand all of a sudden,\nI put these photographs on the wall,\n\n00:05:51.243 --> 00:05:53.875\nand there were arguments,\nand they had to be taken down.\n\n00:05:53.899 --> 00:05:57.247\nAnd I saw the power of the image,\nand it was incredible.\n\n00:05:57.271 --> 00:06:01.105\nAnd I think the most important reaction\nthat I saw there was actually from people\n\n00:06:01.129 --> 00:06:04.004\nthat would never have gone\nto the garbage village themselves,\n\n00:06:04.028 --> 00:06:06.893\nthat would never have seen\nthat the human spirit could thrive\n\n00:06:06.917 --> 00:06:09.001\nin such difficult circumstances.\n\n00:06:09.025 --> 00:06:10.557\nAnd I think it was at that point\n\n00:06:10.581 --> 00:06:14.843\nthat I decided I wanted to use\nphotography and film\n\n00:06:14.867 --> 00:06:17.309\nto somehow bridge gaps,\nto bridge cultures,\n\n00:06:17.333 --> 00:06:20.272\nbring people together, cross borders.\n\n00:06:22.671 --> 00:06:26.307\nAnd so that's what really\nkind of started me off.\n\n00:06:26.331 --> 00:06:29.636\nDid a stint at MTV, made a film\ncalled \"Startup.com,\"\n\n00:06:29.660 --> 00:06:33.934\nand I've done a couple of music films.\n\n00:06:33.958 --> 00:06:37.934\nBut in 2003, when the war\nin Iraq was about to start,\n\n00:06:41.423 --> 00:06:43.635\nit was a very surreal feeling for me,\n\n00:06:43.659 --> 00:06:45.535\nbecause before the war started,\n\n00:06:45.559 --> 00:06:47.971\nthere was kind of this media war\nthat was going on.\n\n00:06:47.995 --> 00:06:50.011\nAnd I was watching television in New York,\n\n00:06:50.035 --> 00:06:53.672\nand there seemed to be just one\npoint of view that was coming across,\n\n00:06:53.696 --> 00:06:58.523\nand the coverage went\nfrom the US State Department\n\n00:06:58.547 --> 00:07:00.584\nto embedded troops.\n\n00:07:01.045 --> 00:07:03.665\nAnd what was coming across on the news\n\n00:07:03.689 --> 00:07:07.934\nwas that there was going to be this\nclean war and precision bombings,\n\n00:07:07.958 --> 00:07:11.732\nand the Iraqis would be greeting\nthe Americans as liberators,\n\n00:07:11.756 --> 00:07:15.032\nand throwing flowers at their feet\nin the streets of Baghdad.\n\n00:07:15.056 --> 00:07:17.929\nAnd I knew that there\nwas a completely other story\n\n00:07:17.953 --> 00:07:20.971\nthat was taking place in the Middle East,\nwhere my parents were.\n\n00:07:20.995 --> 00:07:24.060\nI knew that there was\na completely other story being told,\n\n00:07:24.084 --> 00:07:27.616\nand I was thinking, \"How are people\nsupposed to communicate with each other\n\n00:07:27.640 --> 00:07:30.033\nwhen they're getting completely\ndifferent messages,\n\n00:07:30.057 --> 00:07:32.164\nand nobody knows\nwhat the other's being told?\n\n00:07:32.188 --> 00:07:35.205\nHow are people supposed to have\nany kind of common understanding\n\n00:07:35.229 --> 00:07:37.864\nor know how to move together\ninto the future?\n\n00:07:37.888 --> 00:07:40.136\nSo I knew that I had to go there.\n\n00:07:40.160 --> 00:07:42.200\nI just wanted to be in the center.\n\n00:07:42.224 --> 00:07:44.725\nI had no plan. I had no funding.\n\n00:07:44.749 --> 00:07:48.934\nI didn't even have a camera at the time --\nI had somebody bring it there,\n\n00:07:48.958 --> 00:07:51.934\nbecause I wanted\nto get access to Al Jazeera,\n\n00:07:51.958 --> 00:07:53.934\nGeorge Bush's favorite channel,\n\n00:07:53.958 --> 00:07:59.199\nand a place which I was very curious\nabout because it's disliked\n\n00:07:59.223 --> 00:08:01.714\nby many governments across the Arab world,\n\n00:08:01.738 --> 00:08:05.340\nand also called the mouthpiece\nof Osama Bin Laden\n\n00:08:05.364 --> 00:08:07.545\nby some people in the US government.\n\n00:08:07.569 --> 00:08:11.843\nSo I was thinking, this station\nthat's hated by so many people\n\n00:08:11.867 --> 00:08:13.400\nhas to be doing something right.\n\n00:08:13.424 --> 00:08:16.933\nI've got to go see what this is all about.\n\n00:08:16.957 --> 00:08:19.054\nAnd I also wanted to go see\nCentral Command,\n\n00:08:19.078 --> 00:08:20.622\nwhich was 10 minutes away.\n\n00:08:20.646 --> 00:08:25.934\nAnd that way, I could get access\nto how this news was being created --\n\n00:08:25.958 --> 00:08:28.166\non the Arab side, reaching the Arab world,\n\n00:08:28.190 --> 00:08:30.949\nand on the US and Western side,\nreaching the US.\n\n00:08:30.973 --> 00:08:32.714\nAnd when I went there and sat there,\n\n00:08:32.738 --> 00:08:35.795\nand met these people\nthat were in the center of it,\n\n00:08:35.819 --> 00:08:39.425\nand sat with these characters,\n\n00:08:39.449 --> 00:08:43.726\nI met some surprising,\nvery complex people.\n\n00:08:43.750 --> 00:08:47.934\nAnd I'd like to share with you\na little bit of that experience\n\n00:08:47.958 --> 00:08:49.432\nof when you sit with somebody\n\n00:08:49.456 --> 00:08:51.480\nand you film them, and you listen to them,\n\n00:08:51.504 --> 00:08:54.474\nand you allow them more\nthan a five-second sound bite.\n\n00:08:55.272 --> 00:08:59.958\nThe amazing complexity of people emerges.\n\n00:09:03.659 --> 00:09:05.934\nSamir Khader: Business as usual.\n\n00:09:05.958 --> 00:09:10.308\nIraq, and then Iraq, and then Iraq.\n\n00:09:12.855 --> 00:09:17.632\nBut between us, if I'm offered\na job with Fox, I'll take it.\n\n00:09:22.935 --> 00:09:27.228\nTo change the Arab nightmare\ninto the American dream.\n\n00:09:32.937 --> 00:09:35.163\nI still have that dream.\n\n00:09:35.187 --> 00:09:37.934\nMaybe I will never be able to do it,\n\n00:09:37.958 --> 00:09:41.678\nbut I have plans for my children.\n\n00:09:42.482 --> 00:09:43.872\nWhen they finish high school,\n\n00:09:43.896 --> 00:09:45.912\nI will send them to America\nto study there.\n\n00:09:45.936 --> 00:09:47.681\nI will pay for their study.\n\n00:09:48.599 --> 00:09:50.548\nAnd they will stay there.\n\n00:09:57.133 --> 00:10:00.986\nJosh Rushing: The night they showed\nthe POWs and the dead soldiers --\n\n00:10:01.010 --> 00:10:02.226\nAl Jazeera showed them --\n\n00:10:02.250 --> 00:10:05.454\nit was powerful, because America\ndoesn't show those kinds of images.\n\n00:10:05.478 --> 00:10:08.163\nMost of the news in America\nwon't show really gory images\n\n00:10:08.187 --> 00:10:11.362\nand this showed American soldiers\nin uniform, strewn about a floor,\n\n00:10:11.386 --> 00:10:12.561\na cold tile floor.\n\n00:10:12.585 --> 00:10:15.321\nAnd it was revolting.\n\n00:10:15.345 --> 00:10:16.831\nIt was absolutely revolting.\n\n00:10:16.855 --> 00:10:18.307\nIt made me sick at my stomach.\n\n00:10:18.331 --> 00:10:21.657\nAnd then what hit me was,\nthe night before,\n\n00:10:21.681 --> 00:10:25.276\nthere had been some kind\nof bombing in Basra,\n\n00:10:25.300 --> 00:10:30.116\nand Al Jazeera had shown\nimages of the people.\n\n00:10:30.140 --> 00:10:34.334\nAnd they were equally, if not more,\nhorrifying -- the images were.\n\n00:10:34.358 --> 00:10:36.973\nAnd I remember having seen it\nin the Al Jazeera office,\n\n00:10:36.997 --> 00:10:40.186\nand thought to myself, \"Wow, that's gross.\n\n00:10:40.210 --> 00:10:42.001\nThat's bad.\"\n\n00:10:42.025 --> 00:10:44.935\nAnd then going away, and probably\neating dinner or something.\n\n00:10:44.959 --> 00:10:46.562\nAnd it didn't affect me as much.\n\n00:10:46.586 --> 00:10:49.409\nSo, the impact that had on me --\n\n00:10:49.433 --> 00:10:53.091\nme realizing that I just saw\npeople on the other side,\n\n00:10:53.115 --> 00:10:55.927\nand those people in the Al Jazeera office\n\n00:10:55.951 --> 00:10:58.238\nmust have felt the way\nI was feeling that night,\n\n00:10:58.262 --> 00:11:01.381\nand it upset me on a profound level\n\n00:11:01.405 --> 00:11:04.989\nthat I wasn't as bothered\nas much the night before.\n\n00:11:05.608 --> 00:11:07.180\nIt makes me hate war.\n\n00:11:07.608 --> 00:11:10.186\nBut it doesn't make me believe\nthat we're in a world\n\n00:11:10.210 --> 00:11:11.721\nthat can live without war yet.\n\n00:11:11.745 --> 00:11:14.838\nJehane Noujaim: I was overwhelmed\nby the response of the film.\n\n00:11:14.862 --> 00:11:17.545\nWe didn't know whether\nit would be able to get out there.\n\n00:11:17.569 --> 00:11:18.785\nWe had no funding for it.\n\n00:11:18.809 --> 00:11:22.099\nWe were incredibly lucky\nthat it got picked up.\n\n00:11:23.011 --> 00:11:25.492\nAnd when we showed the film\n\n00:11:25.516 --> 00:11:28.192\nin both the United States\nand the Arab world,\n\n00:11:28.216 --> 00:11:30.333\nwe had such incredible reactions.\n\n00:11:30.357 --> 00:11:33.365\nIt was amazing to see how people\nwere moved by this film.\n\n00:11:33.389 --> 00:11:35.552\nIn the Arab world --\n\n00:11:35.576 --> 00:11:38.413\nand it's not really by the film,\nit's by the characters --\n\n00:11:38.437 --> 00:11:42.468\nI mean, Josh Rushing was\nthis incredibly complex person\n\n00:11:42.492 --> 00:11:44.019\nwho was thinking about things.\n\n00:11:44.043 --> 00:11:46.312\nAnd when I showed the film\nin the Middle East,\n\n00:11:46.336 --> 00:11:48.934\npeople wanted to meet Josh.\n\n00:11:48.958 --> 00:11:51.934\nHe kind of redefined us\nas an American population.\n\n00:11:52.852 --> 00:11:56.934\nPeople started to ask me,\n\"Where is this guy now?\"\n\n00:11:56.958 --> 00:11:58.957\nAl Jazeera offered him a job.\n\n00:11:58.981 --> 00:12:00.934\n(Laughter)\n\n00:12:00.958 --> 00:12:03.208\nAnd Samir, on the other hand,\n\n00:12:03.232 --> 00:12:06.566\nwas also quite an interesting character\nfor the Arab world to see,\n\n00:12:06.590 --> 00:12:10.247\nbecause it brought out the complexities\nof this love-hate relationship\n\n00:12:10.271 --> 00:12:12.389\nthat the Arab world has with the West.\n\n00:12:13.215 --> 00:12:18.406\nIn the United States, I was blown away\nby the motivations,\n\n00:12:18.430 --> 00:12:21.254\nthe positive motivations\nof the American people\n\n00:12:21.278 --> 00:12:23.348\nwhen they'd see this film.\n\n00:12:23.372 --> 00:12:24.967\nYou know, we're criticized abroad\n\n00:12:24.991 --> 00:12:28.482\nfor believing we're the saviors\nof the world in some way,\n\n00:12:28.506 --> 00:12:31.825\nbut the flip side of it is that, actually,\n\n00:12:31.849 --> 00:12:34.183\nwhen people do see\nwhat is happening abroad\n\n00:12:34.207 --> 00:12:36.934\nand people's reactions\nto some of our policy abroad,\n\n00:12:36.958 --> 00:12:39.228\nwe feel this power, that we need to --\n\n00:12:39.252 --> 00:12:41.847\nwe feel like we have to get\nthe power to change things.\n\n00:12:41.871 --> 00:12:43.426\nAnd I saw this with audiences.\n\n00:12:43.450 --> 00:12:47.206\nThis woman came up to me\nafter the screening and said,\n\n00:12:47.230 --> 00:12:48.823\n\"You know, I know this is crazy.\n\n00:12:48.847 --> 00:12:50.870\nI saw the bombs being loaded\non the planes,\n\n00:12:50.894 --> 00:12:52.633\nI saw the military going out to

war,\n\n00:12:59.230 --> 00:13:01.175\nand how do we get out of this bubble?\n\n00:13:01.199 --> 00:13:05.130\nHow do we understand what\nthe other person is thinking?\"\n\n00:13:05.958 --> 00:13:10.029\nNow, I don't know whether\na film can change the world.\n\n00:13:10.053 --> 00:13:12.530\nBut I know the power of it,\n\n00:13:12.554 --> 00:13:15.934\nI know that it starts people thinking\nabout how to change the world.\n\n00:13:16.571 --> 00:13:18.261\nNow, I'm not a philosopher,\n\n00:13:18.285 --> 00:13:21.143\nso I feel like I shouldn't\ngo into great depth on

--> 00:20:10.934\nthat are out there doing this already.\n\n00:20:10.958 --> 00:20:13.934\nThere's Witness,\nthat you heard from earlier.\n\n00:20:13.958 --> 00:20:17.528\nThere's Just Vision, that are working\nwith Palestinians and Israelis\n\n00:20:17.552 --> 00:20:20.884\nwho are working together for peace,\nand documenting that process\n\n00:20:20.908 --> 00:20:23.684\nand getting interviews\nout there and using this film\n\n00:20:23.708 --> 00:20:26.656\nto take to Congress to show\nthat it's a powerful tool,\n\n00:20:26.680 --> 00:20:31.219\nto show that this is a woman who's had\nher daughter killed in an attack,\n\n00:20:31.243 --> 00:20:34.369\nand she believes that there\nare peaceful ways to solve this.\n\n00:20:34.393 --> 00:20:38.203\nThere's Working Films\nand there's Current TV,\n\n00:20:38.227 --> 00:20:41.534\nwhich is an incredible platform\nfor people around the world\n\n00:20:41.558 --> 00:20:42.806\nto be able to put their --\n\n00:20:42.830 --> 00:20:43.834\n(Applause)\n\n00:20:43.858 --> 00:20:45.009\nYeah, it's amazing.\n\n00:20:45.033 --> 00:20:48.460\nI've watched it and I'm blown away by it\n\n00:20:48.484 --> 00:20:51.768\nand its potential to bring voices\nfrom around the world --\n\n00:20:51.792 --> 00:20:53.800\nindependent voices\nfrom around the world --\n\n00:20:53.824 --> 00:20:57.260\nand create a truly democratic,\nglobal television.\n\n00:20:57.284 --> 00:21:01.035\nSo what can we do to create\na platform for these organizations,\n\n00:21:01.059 --> 00:21:02.934\nto create some momentum,\n\n00:21:02.958 --> 00:21:06.349\nto get everybody in the world\ninvolved in this movement?\n\n00:21:08.452 --> 00:21:11.467\nI'd like for us to imagine for a second.\n\n00:21:13.156 --> 00:21:19.987\nImagine a day when you have everyone\ncoming together from around the world.\n\n00:21:20.758 --> 00:21:27.666\nYou have towns and villages\nand theaters --\n\n00:21:27.690 --> 00:21:30.244\nall from around the world,\n\n00:21:30.268 --> 00:21:33.007\ngetting together, and sitting in the dark,\n\n00:21:33.031 --> 00:21:37.531\nand sharing a communal\nexperience of watching a film,\n\n00:21:37.555 --> 00:21:39.678\nor a couple of films, together.\n\n00:21:40.958 --> 00:21:46.440\nWatching a film which maybe highlights\na character that is fighting to live,\n\n00:21:46.464 --> 00:21:49.638\nor just a character\nthat defies stereotypes,\n\n00:21:49.662 --> 00:21:51.731\nmakes a joke, sings a song.\n\n00:21:51.755 --> 00:21:54.034\nComedies, documentaries, shorts.\n\n00:21:54.058 --> 00:21:56.737\nThis amazing power\ncan be used to change people\n\n00:21:56.761 --> 00:21:59.585\nand to bond people together;\nto cross borders,\n\n00:21:59.609 --> 00:22:03.124\nand have people feel like\nthey're having a communal experience.\n\n00:22:03.148 --> 00:22:06.094\nSo if you imagine this day\nwhen all around the world,\n\n00:22:06.118 --> 00:22:11.637\nyou have theaters and places\nwhere we project films.\n\n00:22:11.661 --> 00:22:15.256\nIf you imagine projecting\nfrom Times Square\n\n00:22:15.280 --> 00:22:18.058\nto Tahrir Square in Cairo,\n\n00:22:18.082 --> 00:22:21.758\nthe same film in Ramallah,\nthe same film in Jerusalem.\n\n00:22:21.782 --> 00:22:25.082\nYou know, we've been talking\nto a friend of mine\n\n00:22:25.106 --> 00:22:27.780\nabout using the side of the Great Pyramid\n\n00:22:27.804 --> 00:22:29.463\nand the Great Wall of China.\n\n00:22:32.133 --> 00:22:34.934\nIt's endless what you can imagine,\n\n00:22:34.958 --> 00:22:37.070\nin terms of where you can project films\n\n00:22:37.094 --> 00:22:39.818\nand where you can have\nthis communal experience.\n\n00:22:39.842 --> 00:22:42.934\nAnd I believe that this one day,\nif we can create it,\n\n00:22:42.958 --> 00:22:47.309\nthis one day can create momentum\nfor all of these independent voices.\n\n00:22:47.333 --> 00:22:52.362\nThere isn't an organization\nwhich is connecting the independent voices\n\n00:22:52.386 --> 00:22:53.934\nof the world to get out there,\n\n00:22:53.958 --> 00:22:56.138\nand yet I'm hearing\nthroughout this conference\n\n00:22:56.162 --> 00:22:58.192\nthat the biggest challenge in our future\n\n00:22:58.216 --> 00:22:59.828\nis understanding the other,\n\n00:22:59.852 --> 00:23:03.785\nand having mutual respect\nfor the other and crossing borders.\n\n00:23:03.809 --> 00:23:05.682\nAnd if film can do that,\n\n00:23:05.706 --> 00:23:08.884\nand if we can get all of these\ndifferent locations in the world\n\n00:23:08.908 --> 00:23:11.512\nto watch these films together --\n\n00:23:11.536 --> 00:23:13.693\nthis could be an incredible day.\n\n00:23:14.184 --> 00:23:17.498\nSo we've already made a partnership,\n\n00:23:17.522 --> 00:23:21.411\nset up through somebody\nfrom the TED community,\n\n00:23:21.435 --> 00:23:24.305\nJohn Camen, who introduced me\nto Steven Apkon,\n\n00:23:24.329 --> 00:23:26.934\nfrom the Jacob Burns Film Center.\n\n00:23:26.958 --> 00:23:28.848\nAnd we started calling up everybody.\n\n00:23:28.872 --> 00:23:30.231\nAnd in the last week,\n\n00:23:30.255 --> 00:23:33.934\nthere have been so many people\nthat have responded to us,\n\n00:23:33.958 --> 00:23:38.934\nfrom as close as Palo Alto,\nto Mongolia and to India.\n\n00:23:38.958 --> 00:23:43.514\nThere are people that want to be\na part of this global day of film;\n\n00:23:43.538 --> 00:23:46.934\nto be able to provide a platform\nfor independent voices\n\n00:23:46.958 --> 00:23:49.522\nand independent films to get out there.\n\n00:23:51.141 --> 00:23:54.804\nNow, we've thought\nabout a name for this day,\n\n00:23:54.828 --> 00:23:57.287\nand I'd like to share this with you.\n\n00:23:57.311 --> 00:23:59.572\nNow, the most amazing part\nof this whole process\n\n00:23:59.596 --> 00:24:02.924\nhas been sharing ideas and wishes,\n\n00:24:02.948 --> 00:24:05.934\nand so I invite you\nto give brainstorms onto\n\n00:24:05.958 --> 00:24:09.479\nhow does this day echo into the future?\n\n00:24:09.503 --> 00:24:14.234\nHow do we use technology to make\nthis day echo into the future,\n\n00:24:14.258 --> 00:24:15.934\nso that we can build community\n\n00:24:15.958 --> 00:24:19.958\nand have these communities working\ntogether, through the Internet?\n\n00:24:21.109 --> 00:24:23.648\nThere was a time, many, many years ago,\n\n00:24:23.672 --> 00:24:25.958\nwhen all of the continents\nwere stuck together.\n\n00:24:26.883 --> 00:24:29.828\nAnd we call that landmass Pangea.\n\n00:24:29.852 --> 00:24:34.445\nSo what we'd like to call this day of film\nis Pangea Cinema Day.\n\n00:24:35.572 --> 00:24:37.071\nAnd if you just imagine\n\n00:24:37.095 --> 00:24:40.578\nthat all of these people\nin these towns would be watching,\n\n00:24:40.602 --> 00:24:44.591\nthen I think that we can\nactually really make a movement\n\n00:24:44.615 --> 00:24:46.934\ntowards people understanding\neach other better.\n\n00:24:46.958 --> 00:24:50.777\nI know that it's very intangible,\ntouching people's hearts and souls,\n\n00:24:50.801 --> 00:24:52.834\nbut the only way that I know how to do it,\n\n00:24:52.858 --> 00:24:57.443\nthe only way that I know how to reach out\nto somebody's heart and soul\n\n00:24:57.467 --> 00:24:59.974\nall across the world,\nis by showing them a film.\n\n00:24:59.998 --> 00:25:03.359\nAnd I know that there are independent\nfilmmakers and films out there\n\n00:25:03.383 --> 00:25:05.447\nthat can really make this happen.\n\n00:25:06.030 --> 00:25:07.573\nAnd that's my wish.\n\n00:25:08.112 --> 00:25:12.559\nI guess I'm supposed to give you\nmy one-sentence wish,\n\n00:25:12.583 --> 00:25:14.361\nbut we're way out of time.\n\n00:25:14.958 --> 00:25:17.278\nChris Anderson:\nThat is an incredible wish.\n\n00:25:17.302 --> 00:25:19.934\nPangea Cinema: The day\nthe world comes together.\n\n00:25:19.958 --> 00:25:23.676\nJN: It's more tangible than world peace,\nand it's certainly more immediate.\n\n00:25:23.700 --> 00:25:29.418\nBut it would be the day that the world\ncomes together through film,\n\n00:25:29.442 --> 00:25:30.593\nthe power of film.\n\n00:25:30.617 --> 00:25:32.958\nCA: Ladies and gentlemen, Jehane Noujaim."}, {"title": "My wish: Help me stop pandemics", "duration": "1550", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/larry_brilliant_wants_to_stop_pandemics", "transcript": "I'm the luckiest guy in the world. I got to see the last case of killer smallpox in the world. I was in India this past year, and I may have seen the last cases of polio in the world. There's nothing that makes you feel more \u2014 the blessing and the honor of working in a program like that \u2014 than to know that something that horrible no longer exists. So I'm going to tell you \u2014 (Applause) so I'm going to show you some dirty pictures. They are difficult to watch, but you should look at them with optimism, because the horror of these pictures will be matched by the uplifting quality of knowing that they no longer exist.But first, I'm going to tell you a little bit about my own journey. My background is not exactly the conventional medical education that you might expect. When I was an intern in San Francisco, I heard about a group of Native Americans who had taken over Alcatraz Island, and a Native American who wanted to give birth on that island, and no other doctor wanted to go and help her give birth. I went out to Alcatraz, and I lived on the island for several weeks. She gave birth; I caught the baby; I got off the island; I landed in San Francisco; and all the press wanted to talk to me, because my three weeks on the island made me an expert in Indian affairs. (Laughter)I wound up on every television show. Someone saw me on television; they called me up; and they asked me if I'd like to be in a movie and to play a young doctor for a bunch of rock and roll stars who were traveling in a bus ride from San Francisco to England. And I said, yes, I would do that, so I became the doctor in an absolutely awful movie called \"Medicine Ball Caravan.\" (Laughter) Now, you know from the '60s, you're either on the bus or you're off the bus; I was on the bus. My wife of 37 years and I joined the bus. Our bus ride took us from San Francisco to London, then we switched buses at the big pond. We then got on two more buses and we drove through Turkey and Iran, Afghanistan, over the Khyber Pass into Pakistan, like every other young doctor. This is us at the Khyber Pass, and that's our bus. We had some difficulty getting over the Khyber Pass. But we wound up in India. And then, like everyone else in our generation, we went to live in a Himalayan monastery.(Laughter)This is just like a residency program, for those of you that are in medical school. (Laughter) And we studied with a wise man, a guru named Karoli Baba, who then told me to get rid of the dress, put on a three-piece suit, go join the United Nations as a diplomat and work for the World Health Organization. And he made an outrageous prediction that smallpox would be eradicated, and that this was God's gift to humanity, because of the hard work of dedicated scientists. And that prediction came true. This little girl is Rahima Banu, and she was the last case of killer smallpox in the world. And this document is the certificate that the global commission signed, certifying the world to have eradicated the first disease in history.The key to eradicating smallpox was early detection, early response. I'm going to ask you to repeat that: early detection, early response. Can you say that?Audience: Early detection, early response.Larry Brilliant: Smallpox was the worst disease in history. It killed more people than all the wars in history. In the last century, it killed 500 million people. You're reading about Larry Page already. Somebody reads very fast. (Laughter) In the year that Larry Page and Sergey Brin \u2014 with whom I have a certain affection and a new affiliation \u2014 in the year in which they were born, two million people died of smallpox. We declared smallpox eradicated in 1980. This is the most important slide that I've ever seen in public health, [Sovereigns killed by smallpox] because it shows you to be the richest and the strongest, and to be kings and queens of the world, did not protect you from dying of smallpox. Never can you doubt that we are all in this together.But to see smallpox from the perspective of a sovereign is the wrong perspective. You should see it from the perspective of a mother, watching her child develop this disease and standing by helplessly. Day one, day two, day three, day four, day five, day six. You're a mother and you're watching your child, and on day six, you see pustules that become hard. Day seven, they show the classic scars of smallpox umbilication. Day eight.And Al Gore said earlier that the most photographed image in the world, the most printed image in the world, was that of the Earth. But this was in 1974, and as of that moment, this photograph was the photograph that was the most widely printed, because we printed two billion copies of this photograph, and we took them hand to hand, door to door, to show people and ask them if there was smallpox in their house, because that was our surveillance system. We didn't have Google, we didn't have web crawlers, we didn't have computers.By day nine \u2014 you look at this picture and you're horrified; I look at this picture and I say, \"Thank God,\" because it's clear that this is only an ordinary case of smallpox, and I know this child will live. And by day 13, the lesions are scabbing, his eyelids are swollen, but you know this child has no other secondary infection. And by day 20, while he will be scarred for life, he will live.There are other kinds of smallpox that are not like that. This is confluent smallpox, in which there isn't a single place on the body where you could put a finger and not be covered by lesions. Flat smallpox, which killed 100 percent of people who got it. And hemorrhagic smallpox, the most cruel of all, which had a predilection for pregnant women. I've probably had 50 women die. They all had hemorrhagic smallpox. I've never seen anybody die from it who wasn't a pregnant woman.In 1967, the WHO embarked on what was an outrageous program to eradicate a disease. In that year, there were 34 countries affected with smallpox. By 1970, we were down to 18 countries. 1974, we were down to five countries. But in that year, smallpox exploded throughout India. And India was the place where smallpox made its last stand. In 1974, India had a population of 600 million. There are 21 linguistic states in India, which is like saying 21 different countries. There are 20 million people on the road at any time, in buses and trains, walking; 500,000 villages, 120 million households, and none of them wanted to report if they had a case of smallpox in their house, because they thought that smallpox was the visitation of a deity, Shitala Mata, the cooling mother, and it was wrong to bring strangers into your house when the deity was in the house. No incentive to report smallpox.It wasn't just India that had smallpox deities; smallpox deities were prevalent all over the world. So, how we eradicated smallpox was \u2014 mass vaccination wouldn't work. You could vaccinate everybody in India, but one year later there'd be 21 million new babies, which was then the population of Canada. It wouldn't do just to vaccinate everyone. You had to find every single case of smallpox in the world at the same time, and draw a circle of immunity around it. And that's what we did. In India alone, my 150,000 best friends and I went door to door, with that same picture, to every single house in India. We made over one billion house calls.And in the process, I learned something very important. Every time we did a house-to-house search, we had a spike in the number of reports of smallpox. When we didn't search, we had the illusion that there was no disease. When we did search, we had the illusion that there was more disease. A surveillance system was necessary, because what we needed was early detection, early response. So we searched and we searched, and we found every case of smallpox in India. We had a reward. We raised the reward. We continued to increase the reward. We had a scorecard that we wrote on every house. And as we did that, the number of reported cases in the world dropped to zero. And in 1980, we declared the globe free of smallpox.It was the largest campaign in United Nations history, until the Iraq war. 150,000 people from all over the world \u2014 doctors of every race, religion, culture and nation, who fought side by side, brothers and sisters, with each other, not against each other, in a common cause to make the world better. But smallpox was the fourth disease that was intended for eradication. We failed three other times. We failed against malaria, yellow fever and yaws. But soon we may see polio eradicated. But the key to eradicating polio is early detection, early response. This may be the year we eradicate polio. That will make it the second disease in history. And David Heymann, who's watching this on the webcast \u2014 David, keep on going. We're close! We're down to four countries.(Applause)I feel like Hank Aaron. Barry Bonds can replace me any time.Let's get another disease off the list of terrible things to worry about. I was just in India working on the polio program. The polio surveillance program is four million people going door to door. That is the surveillance system. But we need to have early detection, early response. Blindness, the same thing. The key to discovering blindness is doing epidemiological surveys and finding out the causes of blindness, so you can mount the correct response.The Seva Foundation was started by a group of alumni of the Smallpox Eradication Programme, who, having climbed the highest mountain, tasted the elixir of the success of eradicating a disease, wanted to do it again. And over the last 27 years, Seva's programs in 15 countries have given back sight to more than two million blind people. Seva got started because we wanted to apply these lessons of surveillance and epidemiology to something which nobody else was looking at as a public health issue: blindness, which heretofore had been thought of only as a clinical disease.In 1980, Steve Jobs gave me that computer, which is Apple number 12, and it's still in Kathmandu, and it's still working, and we ought to go get it and auction it off and make more money for Seva. And we conducted the first Nepal survey ever done for health, and the first nationwide blindness survey ever done, and we had astonishing results. Instead of finding out what we thought was the case \u2014 that blindness was caused mostly by glaucoma and trachoma \u2014 we were astounded to find out that blindness was caused instead by cataract. You can't cure or prevent what you don't know is there.In your TED packages there's a DVD, \"Infinite Vision,\" about Dr. V and the Aravind Eye Hospital. I hope that you will take a look at it. Aravind, which started as a Seva project, is now the world's largest and best eye hospital. This year, that one hospital will give back sight to more than 300,000 people in Tamil Nadu, India. (Applause) Bird flu. I stand here as a representative of all terrible things \u2014 this might be the worst. The key to preventing or mitigating pandemic bird flu is early detection and rapid response. We will not have a vaccine or adequate supplies of an antiviral to combat bird flu if it occurs in the next three years. WHO stages the progress of a pandemic. We are now at stage three on the pandemic alert stage, with just a little bit of human-to-human transmission, but no human-to-human-to-human sustained transmission.The moment WHO says we've moved to category four \u2014 this will not be like Katrina. The world as we know it will stop. There'll be no airplanes flying. Would you get in an airplane with 250 people you didn't know, coughing and sneezing, when you knew that some of them might carry a disease that could kill you, for which you had no antivirals or vaccine? I did a study of the top epidemiologists in the world in October. I asked them \u2014 these are all fluologists and specialists in influenza \u2014 and I asked them the questions you'd like to ask them: What do you think the likelihood is that there'll be a pandemic? If it happens, how bad do you think it will be?Fifteen percent said they thought there'd be a pandemic within three years. But much worse than that, 90 percent said they thought there'd be a pandemic within your children or your grandchildren's lifetime. And they thought that if there was a pandemic, a billion people would get sick. As many as 165 million people would die. There would be a global recession and depression as our just-in-time inventory system and the tight rubber band of globalization broke, and the cost to our economy of one to three trillion dollars would be far worse for everyone than merely 100 million people dying, because so many more people would lose their job and their healthcare benefits, that the consequences are almost unthinkable. And it's getting worse, because travel is getting so much better.Let me show you a simulation of what a pandemic looks like. So we know what we're talking about. Let's assume, for example, that the first case occurs in South Asia. It initially goes quite slowly. You get two or three discrete locations. Then there'll be secondary outbreaks, and the disease will spread from country to country so fast that you won't know what hit you. Within three weeks it will be everywhere in the world. Now, if we had an \"undo\" button, and we could go back and isolate it and grab it when it first started \u2014 if we could find it early, and we had early detection and early response, and we could put each one of those viruses in jail \u2014 that's the only way to deal with something like a pandemic. And let me show you why that is.We have a joke. This is an epidemic curve, and everyone in medicine, I think, ultimately gets to know what it is. But the joke is, an epidemiologist likes to arrive at an epidemic right here and ride to glory on the downhill curve. (Laughter) But you don't get to do that usually. You usually arrive right about here. What we really want is to arrive right here, so we can stop the epidemic. But you can't always do that. But there's an organization that has been able to find a way to learn when the first cases occur, and that is called GPHIN; it's the Global Public Health Information Network. And that simulation that I showed you that you thought was bird flu \u2014 that was SARS. And SARS is the pandemic that did not occur. And it didn't occur because GPHIN found the pandemic-to-be of SARS three months before WHO actually announced it, and because of that, we were able to stop the SARS pandemic. And I think we owe a great debt of gratitude to GPHIN and to Ron St. John, who I hope is in the audience some place \u2014 over there \u2014 who's the founder of GPHIN.(Applause)Hello, Ron!(Applause)And TED has flown Ron here from Ottawa, where GPHIN is located, because not only did GPHIN find SARS early, but you may have seen last week that Iran announced that they had bird flu in Iran, but GPHIN found the bird flu in Iran not February 14 \u2014 but last September. We need an early-warning system to protect us against the things that are humanity's worst nightmare. And so my TED wish is based on the common denominator of these experiences. Smallpox \u2014 early detection, early response. Blindness, polio \u2014 early detection, early response. Pandemic bird flu \u2014 early detection, early response. It is a litany. It is so obvious that our only way of dealing with these new diseases is to find them early and to kill them before they spread.So, my TED wish is for you to help build a global system \u2014 an early-warning system \u2014 to protect us against humanity's worst nightmares. And what I thought I would call it is \"Early Detection,\" But it should really be called ... \"Total Early Detection.\" [TED](Laughter) What?(Applause) What? (Applause)But in all seriousness, because this idea is birthed in TED, I would like it to be a legacy of TED, and I'd like to call it the \"International System for Total Early Disease Detection.\" [INSTEDD] And INSTEDD then becomes our mantra. So instead of a hidden pandemic of bird flu, we find it and immediately contain it. Instead of a novel virus caused by bio-terror or bio-error, or shift or drift, we find it and we contain it. Instead of industrial accidents like oil spills or the catastrophe in Bhopal, we find them, and we respond to them. Instead of famine, hidden until it is too late, we detect it, and we respond. And instead of a system which is owned by a government, and hidden in the bowels of government, let's build an early detection system that's freely available to anyone in the world in their own language.Let's make it transparent, non-governmental, not owned by any single country or company, housed in a neutral country, with redundant backup in a different time zone and a different continent. And let's build it on GPHIN. Let's start with GPHIN. Let's increase the websites that they crawl from 20,000 to 20 million. Let's increase the languages they crawl from seven to 70, or more. Let's build in outbound confirmation messages, using text messages or SMS or instant messaging to find out from people who are within 100 meters of the rumor that you hear, if it is, in fact, valid. And let's add satellite confirmation. And we'll add Gapminder's amazing graphics to the front end.And we'll grow it as a moral force in the world, finding out those terrible things before anybody else knows about them, and sending our response to them, so that next year, instead of us meeting here, lamenting how many terrible things there are in the world, we will have pulled together, used the unique skills and the magic of this community, and be proud that we have done everything we can to stop pandemics, other catastrophes, and change the world, beginning right now.(Applause)Chris Anderson: An amazing presentation. First of all, just so everyone understands: you're saying that by creating web crawlers, looking on the Internet for patterns, they can detect something suspicious before WHO, before anyone else can see it? Give an example of how that could possibly be true.Larry Brilliant: You're not mad about the copyright violation?CA: No. I love it.(Laughter)LB: Well, as Ron St. John \u2014 I hope you'll go and meet him in the dinner afterwards and talk to him. When he started GPHIN \u2014 In 1997, there was an outbreak of bird flu \u2014 H5N1. It was in Hong Kong. And a remarkable doctor in Hong Kong responded immediately, by slaughtering 1.5 million chickens and birds, and they stopped that outbreak in its tracks. Immediate detection, immediate response. Then a number of years went by, and there were a lot of rumors about bird flu. Ron and his team in Ottawa began to crawl the web \u2014 only crawling 20,000 different websites, mostly periodicals \u2014 and they read about and heard about a concern, of a lot of children who had high fever and symptoms of bird flu.They reported this to WHO.WHO took a little while taking action, because WHO will only receive a report from a government, because it's the United Nations. But they were able to point to WHO and let them know that there was this surprising and unexplained cluster of illnesses that looked like bird flu. That turned out to be SARS. That's how the world found out about SARS. And because of that, we were able to stop SARS. Now, what's really important is that, before there was GPHIN, 100 percent of all the world's reports of bad things \u2014 whether you're talking about famine or you're talking about bird flu or you're talking about Ebola \u2014 100 percent of all those reports came from nations.The moment these guys in Ottawa \u2014 on a budget of 800,000 dollars a year \u2014 got cracking, 75 percent of all the reports in the world came from GPHIN, 25 percent of all the reports in the world came from all the other 180 nations. Now, here's what's really interesting: after they'd been working for a couple years, what do you think happened to those nations? They felt pretty stupid. So they started sending in their reports early. And now, their reporting percentage is down to 50 percent, because other nations have started to report. So, can you find diseases early by crawling the web? Of course you can. Can you find it even earlier than GPHIN does now? Of course you can. You saw that they found SARS using their Chinese web crawler a full six weeks before they found it using their English web crawler. Well, they're only crawling in seven languages. These bad viruses really don't have any intention of showing up first in English or Spanish or French.(Laughter)So yes, I want to take GPHIN, I want to build on it. I want to add all the languages of the world that we possibly can. I want to make this open to everybody, so that the health officer in Nairobi or in Patna, Bihar will have as much access to it as the folks in Ottawa or in CDC. And I want to make it part of our culture that there is a community of people who are watching out for the worst nightmares of humanity, and that it's accessible to everyone.", "id": 58, "subtitle":

expect.\n\n00:01:13.188 --> 00:01:18.097\nWhen I was an intern in San Francisco,\n\n00:01:18.121 --> 00:01:21.933\nI heard about a group of Native Americans\nwho had taken over Alcatraz Island,\n\n00:01:21.957 --> 00:01:24.934\nand a Native American\nwho wanted to give birth on that island,\n\n00:01:24.958 --> 00:01:29.099\nand no other doctor wanted\nto go and help her give birth.\n\n00:01:29.123 --> 00:01:32.720\nI went out to Alcatraz, and I lived\non the island for several weeks.\n\n00:01:33.546 --> 00:01:36.267\nShe gave birth; I caught\nthe baby; I got off the island;\n\n00:01:36.291 --> 00:01:38.147\nI landed in San Francisco;\n\n00:01:38.171 --> 00:01:40.059\nand all the press wanted to talk to me,\n\n00:01:40.083 --> 00:01:44.184\nbecause my three weeks on the island\nmade me an expert in Indian affairs.\n\n00:01:44.208 --> 00:01:45.212\n(Laughter)\n\n00:01:45.236 --> 00:01:47.275\nI wound up on every television show.\n\n00:01:47.299 --> 00:01:50.411\nSomeone saw me on television;\nthey called me up; and they asked me\n\n00:01:50.435 --> 00:01:53.040\nif I'd like to be in a movie\nand to play a young doctor\n\n00:01:53.064 --> 00:01:56.214\nfor a bunch of rock and roll stars\nwho were traveling in a bus ride\n\n00:01:56.238 --> 00:01:58.312\nfrom San Francisco to England.\n\n00:01:58.336 --> 00:01:59.934\nAnd I said, yes, I would do that,\n\n00:01:59.958 --> 00:02:04.214\nso I became the doctor\nin an absolutely awful movie\n\n00:02:04.238 --> 00:02:06.136\ncalled \"Medicine Ball Caravan.\"\n\n00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:07.206\n(Laughter)\n\n00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:08.702\nNow, you know from the '60s,\n\n00:02:08.726 --> 00:02:11.803\nyou're either on the bus\nor you're off the bus; I was on the bus.\n\n00:02:11.827 --> 00:02:14.824\nMy wife of 37 years and I joined the bus.\n\n00:02:14.848 --> 00:02:17.528\nOur bus ride took us\nfrom San Francisco to London,\n\n00:02:17.552 --> 00:02:19.751\nthen we switched buses at the big pond.\n\n00:02:19.775 --> 00:02:23.203\nWe then got on two more buses\n\n00:02:23.227 --> 00:02:26.299\nand we drove through Turkey\nand Iran, Afghanistan,\n\n00:02:26.323 --> 00:02:29.934\nover the Khyber Pass into Pakistan,\nlike every other young doctor.\n\n00:02:29.958 --> 00:02:32.625\nThis is us at the Khyber Pass,\nand that's our bus.\n\n00:02:32.649 --> 00:02:35.304\nWe had some difficulty getting\nover the Khyber Pass.\n\n00:02:36.487 --> 00:02:37.958\nBut we wound up in India.\n\n00:02:38.423 --> 00:02:40.672\nAnd then, like everyone else\nin our generation,\n\n00:02:40.696 --> 00:02:42.981\nwe went to live in a Himalayan monastery.\n\n00:02:43.005 --> 00:02:44.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:02:46.378 --> 00:02:48.189\nThis is just like a residency program,\n\n00:02:48.213 --> 00:02:50.369\nfor those of you\nthat are in medical school.\n\n00:02:50.393 --> 00:02:52.026\n(Laughter)\n\n00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:57.250\nAnd we studied with a wise man,\na guru named Karoli Baba,\n\n00:02:57.274 --> 00:03:00.916\nwho then told me to get rid of the dress,\n\n00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:02.683\nput on a three-piece suit,\n\n00:03:02.707 --> 00:03:05.961\ngo join the United Nations as a diplomat\n\n00:03:05.985 --> 00:03:08.045\nand work for the World\nHealth Organization.\n\n00:03:08.069 --> 00:03:12.437\nAnd he made an outrageous prediction\nthat smallpox would be eradicated,\n\n00:03:12.461 --> 00:03:15.483\nand that this was God's gift to humanity,\n\n00:03:15.507 --> 00:03:18.012\nbecause of the hard work\nof dedicated scientists.\n\n00:03:18.618 --> 00:03:20.622\nAnd that prediction came true.\n\n00:03:21.462 --> 00:03:23.772\nThis little girl is Rahima Banu,\n\n00:03:23.796 --> 00:03:26.761\nand she was the last case\nof killer smallpox in the world.\n\n00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:32.166\nAnd this document is the certificate\nthat the global commission signed,\n\n00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:36.958\ncertifying the world to have eradicated\nthe first disease in history.\n\n00:03:38.294 --> 00:03:43.934\nThe key to eradicating smallpox\nwas early detection, early response.\n\n00:03:44.619 --> 00:03:48.626\nI'm going to ask you to repeat that:\nearly detection, early response.\n\n00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:49.802\nCan you say that?\n\n00:03:49.826 --> 00:03:52.248\nAudience: Early detection, early response.\n\n00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:55.829\nLarry Brilliant: Smallpox\nwas the worst disease in history.\n\n00:03:55.853 --> 00:03:58.371\nIt killed more people\nthan all the wars in history.\n\n00:03:58.395 --> 00:04:02.958\nIn the last century,\nit killed 500 million people.\n\n00:04:04.901 --> 00:04:06.807\nYou're reading about Larry Page already.\n\n00:04:06.831 --> 00:04:08.403\nSomebody reads very fast.\n\n00:04:08.427 --> 00:04:09.981\n(Laughter)\n\n00:04:10.005 --> 00:04:12.179\nIn the year that Larry Page\nand Sergey Brin --\n\n00:04:12.203 --> 00:04:15.819\nwith whom I have a certain affection\nand a new affiliation --\n\n00:04:15.843 --> 00:04:18.023\nin the year in which they were born,\n\n00:04:18.047 --> 00:04:20.168\ntwo million people died of smallpox.\n\n00:04:21.017 --> 00:04:24.612\nWe declared smallpox eradicated in 1980.\n\n00:04:25.718 --> 00:04:29.014\nThis is the most important slide\nthat I've ever seen in public health,\n\n00:04:29.038 --> 00:04:31.522\n[Sovereigns killed by smallpox]\nbecause it shows you\n\n00:04:31.546 --> 00:04:33.417\nto be the richest and the strongest,\n\n00:04:33.441 --> 00:04:35.366\nand to be kings and queens of the world,\n\n00:04:35.390 --> 00:04:37.464\ndid not protect you\nfrom dying of smallpox.\n\n00:04:37.488 --> 00:04:41.300\nNever can you doubt\nthat we are all in this together.\n\n00:04:42.427 --> 00:04:46.337\nBut to see smallpox\nfrom the perspective of a sovereign\n\n00:04:46.361 --> 00:04:47.861\nis the wrong perspective.\n\n00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:50.934\nYou should see it\nfrom the perspective of a mother,\n\n00:04:50.958 --> 00:04:54.775\nwatching her child develop\nthis disease and standing by helplessly.\n\n00:04:54.799 --> 00:05:00.530\nDay one, day two, day three,\n\n00:05:00.554 --> 00:05:06.159\nday four, day five, day six.\n\n00:05:06.659 --> 00:05:09.572\nYou're a mother and you're\nwatching your child,\n\n00:05:09.596 --> 00:05:14.572\nand on day six, you see\npustules that become hard.\n\n00:05:15.358 --> 00:05:20.082\nDay seven, they show the classic scars\nof smallpox umbilication.\n\n00:05:20.106 --> 00:05:21.416\nDay eight.\n\n00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:23.168\nAnd Al Gore said earlier\n\n00:05:23.192 --> 00:05:26.081\nthat the most photographed\nimage in the world,\n\n00:05:26.105 --> 00:05:27.852\nthe most printed image in the world,\n\n00:05:27.876 --> 00:05:29.036\nwas that of the Earth.\n\n00:05:29.474 --> 00:05:32.671\nBut this was in 1974,\nand as of that moment,\n\n00:05:32.695 --> 00:05:36.318\nthis photograph was the photograph\nthat was the most widely printed,\n\n00:05:36.342 --> 00:05:39.827\nbecause we printed two billion copies\nof this photograph,\n\n00:05:39.851 --> 00:05:43.005\nand we took them\nhand to hand, door to door,\n\n00:05:43.029 --> 00:05:47.910\nto show people and ask them\nif there was smallpox in their house,\n\n00:05:47.934 --> 00:05:50.040\nbecause that was our surveillance system.\n\n00:05:50.064 --> 00:05:52.619\nWe didn't have Google,\nwe didn't have web crawlers,\n\n00:05:52.643 --> 00:05:54.373\nwe didn't have computers.\n\n00:05:55.825 --> 00:05:59.682\nBy day nine -- you look at this picture\nand you're horrified;\n\n00:05:59.706 --> 00:06:02.239\nI look at this picture\nand I say, \"Thank God,\"\n\n00:06:02.263 --> 00:06:06.224\nbecause it's clear that this is only\nan ordinary case of smallpox,\n\n00:06:06.248 --> 00:06:08.239\nand I know this child will live.\n\n00:06:09.445 --> 00:06:14.788\nAnd by day 13, the lesions\nare scabbing, his eyelids are swollen,\n\n00:06:14.812 --> 00:06:18.641\nbut you know this child has\nno other secondary infection.\n\n00:06:19.022 --> 00:06:23.339\nAnd by day 20, while he will be\nscarred for life, he will live.\n\n00:06:24.133 --> 00:06:27.182\nThere are other kinds of smallpox\nthat are not like that.\n\n00:06:27.206 --> 00:06:29.594\nThis is confluent smallpox,\n\n00:06:29.618 --> 00:06:33.403\nin which there isn't a single place\non the body where you could put a finger\n\n00:06:33.427 --> 00:06:36.236\nand not be covered by lesions.\n\n00:06:36.260 --> 00:06:40.546\nFlat smallpox, which killed 100 percent\nof people who got it.\n\n00:06:40.570 --> 00:06:43.539\nAnd hemorrhagic smallpox,\nthe most cruel of all,\n\n00:06:43.563 --> 00:06:46.831\nwhich had a predilection\nfor pregnant women.\n\n00:06:46.855 --> 00:06:48.822\nI've probably had 50 women die.\n\n00:06:49.268 --> 00:06:51.370\nThey all had hemorrhagic smallpox.\n\n00:06:51.394 --> 00:06:54.718\nI've never seen anybody die from it\nwho wasn't a pregnant woman.\n\n00:06:55.416 --> 00:06:59.337\nIn 1967, the WHO embarked\non what was an outrageous program\n\n00:06:59.361 --> 00:07:00.845\nto eradicate a disease.\n\n00:07:01.162 --> 00:07:04.734\nIn that year, there were 34 countries\naffected with smallpox.\n\n00:07:05.321 --> 00:07:08.227\nBy 1970, we were down to 18 countries.\n\n00:07:08.806 --> 00:07:11.418\n1974, we were down to five countries.\n\n00:07:11.806 --> 00:07:16.120\nBut in that year,\nsmallpox exploded throughout India.\n\n00:07:17.112 --> 00:07:20.934\nAnd India was the place\nwhere smallpox made its last stand.\n\n00:07:21.506 --> 00:07:24.545\nIn 1974, India had\na population of 600 million.\n\n00:07:24.569 --> 00:07:27.587\nThere are 21 linguistic states in India,\n\n00:07:27.611 --> 00:07:29.803\nwhich is like saying\n21 different countries.\n\n00:07:30.200 --> 00:07:33.097\nThere are 20 million people\non the road at any time,\n\n00:07:33.121 --> 00:07:39.140\nin buses and trains, walking;\n500,000 villages, 120 million households,\n\n00:07:39.164 --> 00:07:41.468\nand none of them wanted to report\n\n00:07:41.492 --> 00:07:43.934\nif they had a case\nof smallpox in their house,\n\n00:07:43.958 --> 00:07:47.322\nbecause they thought that smallpox\nwas the visitation of a deity,\n\n00:07:47.346 --> 00:07:49.369\nShitala Mata, the cooling mother,\n\n00:07:49.393 --> 00:07:53.569\nand it was wrong to bring\nstrangers into your house\n\n00:07:53.593 --> 00:07:55.340\nwhen the deity was in the house.\n\n00:07:56.006 --> 00:07:58.255\nNo incentive to report smallpox.\n\n00:07:58.644 --> 00:08:01.249\nIt wasn't just India\nthat had smallpox deities;\n\n00:08:01.273 --> 00:08:04.537\nsmallpox deities were\nprevalent all over the world.\n\n00:08:04.958 --> 00:08:08.370\nSo, how we eradicated smallpox was --\n\n00:08:08.394 --> 00:08:10.668\nmass vaccination wouldn't work.\n\n00:08:10.692 --> 00:08:12.595\nYou could vaccinate everybody in India,\n\n00:08:12.619 --> 00:08:15.119\nbut one year later there'd be\n21 million new babies,\n\n00:08:15.143 --> 00:08:17.238\nwhich was then the population of Canada.\n\n00:08:17.651 --> 00:08:19.839\nIt wouldn't do just to vaccinate everyone.\n\n00:08:19.863 --> 00:08:22.934\nYou had to find every single\ncase of smallpox in the world\n\n00:08:22.958 --> 00:08:25.934\nat the same time, and draw\na circle of immunity around it.\n\n00:08:26.503 --> 00:08:27.958\nAnd that's what we did.\n\n00:08:29.273 --> 00:08:34.468\nIn India alone, my 150,000 best friends\nand I went door to door,\n\n00:08:34.492 --> 00:08:36.566\nwith that same picture,\n\n00:08:36.590 --> 00:08:38.161\nto every single house in India.\n\n00:08:38.185 --> 00:08:40.061\nWe made over one billion house calls.\n\n00:08:41.499 --> 00:08:45.015\nAnd in the process,\nI learned something very important.\n\n00:08:45.721 --> 00:08:49.979\nEvery time we did a house-to-house search,\n\n00:08:50.003 --> 00:08:54.727\nwe had a spike in the number\nof reports of smallpox.\n\n00:08:54.751 --> 00:08:59.886\nWhen we didn't search, we had\nthe illusion that there was no disease.\n\n00:08:59.910 --> 00:09:04.114\nWhen we did search, we had the illusion\nthat there was more disease.\n\n00:09:04.138 --> 00:09:06.377\nA surveillance system was necessary,\n\n00:09:06.401 --> 00:09:12.378\nbecause what we needed\nwas early detection, early response.\n\n00:09:13.680 --> 00:09:15.879\nSo we searched and we searched,\n\n00:09:15.903 --> 00:09:18.753\nand we found every case\nof smallpox in India.\n\n00:09:18.777 --> 00:09:21.738\nWe had a reward. We raised the reward.\n\n00:09:21.762 --> 00:09:23.818\nWe continued to increase the reward.\n\n00:09:23.842 --> 00:09:26.655\nWe had a scorecard\nthat we wrote on every house.\n\n00:09:27.384 --> 00:09:29.115\nAnd as we did that,\n\n00:09:29.139 --> 00:09:32.515\nthe number of reported cases\nin the world dropped to zero.\n\n00:09:33.921 --> 00:09:38.601\nAnd in 1980, we declared the globe\nfree of smallpox.\n\n00:09:38.625 --> 00:09:43.130\nIt was the largest campaign\nin United Nations history,\n\n00:09:43.154 --> 00:09:44.764\nuntil the Iraq war.\n\n00:09:45.615 --> 00:09:48.934\n150,000 people from all over the world --\n\n00:09:48.958 --> 00:09:51.874\ndoctors of every race,\nreligion, culture and nation,\n\n00:09:51.898 --> 00:09:56.793\nwho fought side by side,\nbrothers and sisters,\n\n00:09:56.817 --> 00:10:00.055\nwith each other, not against each other,\n\n00:10:00.079 --> 00:10:02.301\nin a common cause\nto make the world better.\n\n00:10:03.206 --> 00:10:07.002\nBut smallpox was the fourth disease\nthat was intended for eradication.\n\n00:10:07.026 --> 00:10:09.279\nWe failed three other times.\n\n00:10:09.303 --> 00:10:12.582\nWe failed against malaria,\nyellow fever and yaws.\n\n00:10:12.606 --> 00:10:15.934\nBut soon we may see polio eradicated.\n\n00:10:15.958 --> 00:10:21.695\nBut the key to eradicating polio\nis early detection, early response.\n\n00:10:22.568 --> 00:10:25.417\nThis may be the year we eradicate polio.\n\n00:10:25.441 --> 00:10:28.131\nThat will make it\nthe second disease in history.\n\n00:10:28.155 --> 00:10:32.294\nAnd David Heymann, who's watching\nthis on the webcast --\n\n00:10:32.318 --> 00:10:35.278\nDavid, keep on going. We're close!\n\n00:10:35.302 --> 00:10:36.934\nWe're down to four countries.\n\n00:10:36.958 --> 00:10:43.365\n(Applause)\n\n00:10:43.389 --> 00:10:44.604\nI feel like Hank Aaron.\n\n00:10:44.628 --> 00:10:46.631\nBarry Bonds can replace me any time.\n\n00:10:46.655 --> 00:10:50.789\nLet's get another disease off the list\nof terrible things to worry about.\n\n00:10:51.773 --> 00:10:55.022\nI was just in India working on\nthe polio program.\n\n00:10:55.046 --> 00:11:00.809\nThe polio surveillance program\nis four million people going door to door.\n\n00:11:00.833 --> 00:11:02.934\nThat is the surveillance system.\n\n00:11:02.958 --> 00:11:07.084\nBut we need to have\nearly detection, early response.\n\n00:11:07.108 --> 00:11:08.735\nBlindness, the same thing.\n\n00:11:08.759 --> 00:11:13.711\nThe key to discovering blindness\nis doing epidemiological surveys\n\n00:11:13.735 --> 00:11:15.934\nand finding out the causes of blindness,\n\n00:11:15.958 --> 00:11:18.616\nso you can mount the correct response.\n\n00:11:19.219 --> 00:11:23.832\nThe Seva Foundation\nwas started by a group of alumni\n\n00:11:23.856 --> 00:11:26.748\nof the Smallpox Eradication Programme,\n\n00:11:26.772 --> 00:11:29.463\nwho, having climbed the highest mountain,\n\n00:11:29.487 --> 00:11:33.934\ntasted the elixir of the success\nof eradicating a disease,\n\n00:11:33.958 --> 00:11:35.934\nwanted to do it again.\n\n00:11:35.958 --> 00:11:40.826\nAnd over the last 27 years,\nSeva's programs in 15 countries\n\n00:11:40.850 --> 00:11:43.934\nhave given back sight\nto more than two million blind people.\n\n00:11:44.940 --> 00:11:48.071\nSeva got started because we wanted\nto apply these lessons\n\n00:11:48.095 --> 00:11:50.690\nof surveillance and epidemiology\n\n00:11:50.714 --> 00:11:54.639\nto something which nobody else\nwas looking at as a public health issue:\n\n00:11:54.663 --> 00:11:58.649\nblindness, which heretofore had been\nthought of only as a clinical disease.\n\n00:11:59.792 --> 00:12:06.064\nIn 1980, Steve Jobs gave me\nthat computer, which is Apple number 12,\n\n00:12:06.088 --> 00:12:08.541\nand it's still in Kathmandu,\nand it's still working,\n\n00:12:08.565 --> 00:12:12.410\nand we ought to go get it and auction\nit off and make more money for Seva.\n\n00:12:13.172 --> 00:12:17.208\nAnd we conducted the first Nepal survey\never done for health,\n\n00:12:17.232 --> 00:12:20.089\nand the first nationwide\nblindness survey ever done,\n\n00:12:20.113 --> 00:12:21.934\nand we had astonishing results.\n\n00:12:22.520 --> 00:12:25.231\nInstead of finding out\nwhat we thought was the case --\n\n00:12:25.255 --> 00:12:28.934\nthat blindness was caused mostly\nby glaucoma and trachoma --\n\n00:12:28.958 --> 00:12:31.422\nwe were astounded to find out\n\n00:12:31.446 --> 00:12:35.121\nthat blindness was caused\ninstead by cataract.\n\n00:12:36.050 --> 00:12:40.177\nYou can't cure or prevent\nwhat you don't know is there.\n\n00:12:42.103 --> 00:12:46.299\nIn your TED packages\nthere's a DVD, \"Infinite Vision,\"\n\n00:12:46.323 --> 00:12:48.934\nabout Dr. V and the Aravind Eye Hospital.\n\n00:12:48.958 --> 00:12:50.990\nI hope that you will take a look at it.\n\n00:12:51.014 --> 00:12:53.188\nAravind, which started as a Seva project,\n\n00:12:53.212 --> 00:12:56.160\nis now the world's largest\nand best eye hospital.\n\n00:12:56.184 --> 00:12:59.581\nThis year, that one hospital\nwill give back sight\n\n00:12:59.605 --> 00:13:03.156\nto more than 300,000 people\nin Tamil Nadu, India.\n\n00:13:03.180 --> 00:13:07.454\n(Applause)\n\n00:13:07.478 --> 00:13:08.630\nBird flu.\n\n00:13:08.654 --> 00:13:11.475\nI stand here as a representative\nof all terrible things --\n\n00:13:11.499 --> 00:13:12.958\nthis might be the worst.\n\n00:13:13.749 --> 00:13:18.503\nThe key to preventing\nor mitigating pandemic bird flu\n\n00:13:18.527 --> 00:13:20.934\nis early detection and rapid response.\n\n00:13:20.958 --> 00:13:26.761\nWe will not have a vaccine\nor adequate supplies of an antiviral\n\n00:13:26.785 --> 00:13:29.934\nto combat bird flu if it occurs\nin the next three years.\n\n00:13:30.300 --> 00:13:33.934\nWHO stages the progress of a pandemic.\n\n00:13:34.304 --> 00:13:38.697\nWe are now at stage three\non the pandemic alert stage,\n\n00:13:38.721 --> 00:13:42.276\nwith just a little bit\nof human-to-human transmission,\n\n00:13:42.300 --> 00:13:45.934\nbut no human-to-human-to-human\nsustained transmission.\n\n00:13:45.958 --> 00:13:50.186\nThe moment WHO says\nwe've moved to category four --\n\n00:13:50.210 --> 00:13:52.373\nthis will not be like Katrina.\n\n00:13:52.397 --> 00:13:54.476\nThe world as we know it will stop.\n\n00:13:54.500 --> 00:13:56.242\nThere'll be no airplanes flying.\n\n00:13:56.958 --> 00:14:00.107\nWould you get in an airplane\nwith 250 people you didn't know,\n\n00:14:00.131 --> 00:14:01.283\ncoughing and sneezing,\n\n00:14:01.307 --> 00:14:04.800\nwhen you knew that some of them\nmight carry a disease that could kill you,\n\n00:14:04.824 --> 00:14:07.704\nfor which you had\nno antivirals or vaccine?\n\n00:14:08.835 --> 00:14:12.852\nI did a study of the top epidemiologists\nin the world in October.\n\n00:14:12.876 --> 00:14:16.934\nI asked them -- these are all fluologists\nand specialists in influenza --\n\n00:14:16.958 --> 00:14:19.794\nand I asked them the questions\nyou'd like to ask them:\n\n00:14:19.818 --> 00:14:23.006\nWhat do you think the likelihood\nis that there'll be a pandemic?\n\n00:14:23.030 --> 00:14:25.707\nIf it happens, how bad\ndo you think it will be?\n\n00:14:26.580 --> 00:14:30.671\nFifteen percent said they thought\nthere'd be a pandemic within three years.\n\n00:14:30.695 --> 00:14:32.631\nBut much worse than that,\n\n00:14:32.655 --> 00:14:36.117\n90 percent said they thought\nthere'd be a pandemic\n\n00:14:36.141 --> 00:14:39.062\nwithin your children\nor your grandchildren's lifetime.\n\n00:14:40.205 --> 00:14:43.729\nAnd they thought\nthat if there was a pandemic,\n\n00:14:43.753 --> 00:14:45.769\na billion people would get sick.\n\n00:14:46.681 --> 00:14:50.110\nAs many as 165 million people would die.\n\n00:14:50.808 --> 00:14:53.324\nThere would be a global\nrecession and depression\n\n00:14:53.348 --> 00:14:55.526\nas our just-in-time inventory system\n\n00:14:55.550 --> 00:14:59.368\nand the tight rubber band\nof globalization broke,\n\n00:14:59.392 --> 00:15:03.336\nand the cost to our economy\nof one to three trillion dollars\n\n00:15:03.360 --> 00:15:08.982\nwould be far worse for everyone\nthan merely 100 million people dying,\n\n00:15:09.006 --> 00:15:11.308\nbecause so many more people\nwould lose their job\n\n00:15:11.332 --> 00:15:12.934\nand their healthcare benefits,\n\n00:15:12.958 --> 00:15:15.413\nthat the consequences\nare almost unthinkable.\n\n00:15:17.127 --> 00:15:20.958\nAnd it's getting worse,\nbecause travel is getting so much better.\n\n00:15:23.168 --> 00:15:28.867\nLet me show you a simulation\nof what a pandemic looks like.\n\n00:15:29.704 --> 00:15:31.704\nSo we know what we're talking about.\n\n00:15:32.351 --> 00:15:35.958\nLet's assume, for example,\nthat the first case occurs in South Asia.\n\n00:15:37.358 --> 00:15:39.708\nIt initially goes quite slowly.\n\n00:15:39.732 --> 00:15:42.348\nYou get two or three discrete locations.\n\n00:15:44.086 --> 00:15:48.699\nThen there'll be secondary outbreaks,\nand the disease will spread\n\n00:15:48.723 --> 00:15:52.934\nfrom country to country so fast\nthat you won't know what hit you.\n\n00:15:53.468 --> 00:15:56.934\nWithin three weeks\nit will be everywhere in the world.\n\n00:15:57.744 --> 00:16:03.095\nNow, if we had an \"undo\" button,\nand we could go back and isolate it\n\n00:16:03.119 --> 00:16:06.476\nand grab it when it first started --\nif we could find it early,\n\n00:16:06.500 --> 00:16:08.934\nand we had early detection\nand early response,\n\n00:16:08.958 --> 00:16:12.648\nand we could put each one\nof those viruses in jail --\n\n00:16:12.672 --> 00:16:17.553\nthat's the only way to deal with\nsomething like a pandemic.\n\n00:16:19.307 --> 00:16:20.958\nAnd let me show you why that is.\n\n00:16:22.053 --> 00:16:23.213\nWe have a joke.\n\n00:16:23.237 --> 00:16:26.061\nThis is an epidemic curve,\nand everyone in medicine,\n\n00:16:26.085 --> 00:16:28.508\nI think, ultimately gets\nto know what it is.\n\n00:16:28.532 --> 00:16:29.686\nBut the joke is,\n\n00:16:29.710 --> 00:16:32.819\nan epidemiologist likes to arrive\nat an epidemic right here\n\n00:16:32.843 --> 00:16:34.981\nand ride to glory on the downhill curve.\n\n00:16:35.005 --> 00:16:36.108\n(Laughter)\n\n00:16:36.132 --> 00:16:37.934\nBut you don't get to do that usually.\n\n00:16:37.958 --> 00:16:39.936\nYou usually arrive right about here.\n\n00:16:40.483 --> 00:16:45.767\nWhat we really want is to arrive\nright here, so we can stop the epidemic.\n\n00:16:46.283 --> 00:16:47.714\nBut you can't always do that.\n\n00:16:48.150 --> 00:16:51.707\nBut there's an organization\nthat has been able to find a way\n\n00:16:51.731 --> 00:16:53.934\nto learn when the first cases occur,\n\n00:16:53.958 --> 00:16:56.307\nand that is called GPHIN;\n\n00:16:56.331 --> 00:16:58.854\nit's the Global Public Health\nInformation Network.\n\n00:16:59.204 --> 00:17:01.292\nAnd that simulation that I showed you\n\n00:17:01.316 --> 00:17:03.513\nthat you thought\nwas bird flu -- that was SARS.\n\n00:17:03.921 --> 00:17:06.721\nAnd SARS is the pandemic\nthat did not occur.\n\n00:17:07.290 --> 00:17:08.689\nAnd it didn't occur\n\n00:17:08.713 --> 00:17:15.024\nbecause GPHIN found\nthe pandemic-to-be of SARS\n\n00:17:15.048 --> 00:17:21.086\nthree months before WHO actually\nannounced it, and because of that,\n\n00:17:21.110 --> 00:17:24.276\nwe were able to stop the SARS pandemic.\n\n00:17:24.300 --> 00:17:26.381\nAnd I think we owe\na great debt of gratitude\n\n00:17:26.405 --> 00:17:28.562\nto GPHIN and to Ron St. John,\n\n00:17:28.586 --> 00:17:32.037\nwho I hope is in the audience\nsome place -- over there --\n\n00:17:32.061 --> 00:17:33.934\nwho's the founder of GPHIN.\n\n00:17:33.958 --> 00:17:35.441\n(Applause)\n\n00:17:35.465 --> 00:17:36.934\nHello, Ron!\n\n00:17:36.958 --> 00:17:43.758\n(Applause)\n\n00:17:45.568 --> 00:17:50.182\nAnd TED has flown Ron here\nfrom Ottawa, where GPHIN is located,\n\n00:17:50.206 --> 00:17:54.643\nbecause not only\ndid GPHIN find SARS early,\n\n00:17:54.667 --> 00:17:56.784\nbut you may have seen last week\n\n00:17:56.808 --> 00:18:01.139\nthat Iran announced\nthat they had bird flu in Iran,\n\n00:18:01.163 --> 00:18:04.855\nbut GPHIN found the bird flu\nin Iran not February 14 --\n\n00:18:04.879 --> 00:18:06.736\nbut last September.\n\n00:18:06.760 --> 00:18:09.420\nWe need an early-warning system\n\n00:18:09.444 --> 00:18:13.779\nto protect us against the things\nthat are humanity's worst nightmare.\n\n00:18:14.597 --> 00:18:18.399\nAnd so my TED wish is based on\nthe common denominator\n\n00:18:18.423 --> 00:18:19.789\nof these experiences.\n\n00:18:19.813 --> 00:18:22.699\nSmallpox -- early detection,\nearly response.\n\n00:18:22.723 --> 00:18:25.850\nBlindness, polio --\nearly detection, early response.\n\n00:18:26.207 --> 00:18:30.199\nPandemic bird flu --\nearly detection, early response.\n\n00:18:30.223 --> 00:18:31.610\nIt is a litany.\n\n00:18:31.634 --> 00:18:36.648\nIt is so obvious that our only way\nof dealing with these new diseases\n\n00:18:36.672 --> 00:18:40.999\nis to find them early\nand to kill them before they spread.\n\n00:18:41.023 --> 00:18:45.431\nSo, my TED wish is for you\nto help build a global system --\n\n00:18:45.455 --> 00:18:46.934\nan early-warning system --\n\n00:18:46.958 --> 00:18:50.689\nto protect us against\nhumanity's worst nightmares.\n\n00:18:51.339 --> 00:18:57.462\nAnd what I thought I would call it\nis \"Early Detection,\"\n\n00:18:58.682 --> 00:19:00.806\nBut it should really be called ...\n\n00:19:02.181 --> 00:19:03.830\n\"Total Early Detection.\"\n[TED]\n\n00:19:03.854 --> 00:19:04.937\n(Laughter)\n\n00:19:04.961 --> 00:19:06.112\nWhat?\n\n00:19:06.136 --> 00:19:13.121\n(Applause)\n\n00:19:13.551 --> 00:19:14.701\nWhat?\n\n00:19:14.725 --> 00:19:17.208\n(Applause)\n\n00:19:18.177 --> 00:19:20.020\nBut in all seriousness,\n\n00:19:20.044 --> 00:19:23.567\nbecause this idea is birthed in TED,\n\n00:19:23.591 --> 00:19:28.934\nI would like it to be\na legacy of TED, and I'd like to call it\n\n00:19:28.958 --> 00:19:34.179\nthe \"International System for Total\nEarly Disease Detection.\"\n\n00:19:34.203 --> 00:19:35.401\n[INSTEDD]\n\n00:19:37.758 --> 00:19:42.344\nAnd INSTEDD then becomes our mantra.\n\n00:19:45.193 --> 00:19:47.698\nSo instead of a hidden\npandemic of bird flu,\n\n00:19:47.722 --> 00:19:49.722\nwe find it and immediately contain it.\n\n00:19:50.681 --> 00:19:55.556\nInstead of a novel virus\ncaused by bio-terror or bio-error,\n\n00:19:55.580 --> 00:19:59.567\nor shift or drift,\nwe find it and we contain it.\n\n00:20:00.226 --> 00:20:02.712\nInstead of industrial\naccidents like oil spills\n\n00:20:02.736 --> 00:20:04.934\nor the catastrophe in Bhopal,\n\n00:20:04.958 --> 00:20:08.168\nwe find them, and we respond to them.\n\n00:20:08.748 --> 00:20:11.871\nInstead of famine,\nhidden until it is too late,\n\n00:20:11.895 --> 00:20:14.837\nwe detect it, and we respond.\n\n00:20:16.019 --> 00:20:19.186\nAnd instead of a system\nwhich is owned by a government,\n\n00:20:19.210 --> 00:20:21.631\nand hidden in the bowels of government,\n\n00:20:21.655 --> 00:20:24.257\nlet's build an early detection system\n\n00:20:24.281 --> 00:20:28.110\nthat's freely available to anyone\nin the world in their own language.\n\n00:20:28.816 --> 00:20:33.584\nLet's make it transparent,\nnon-governmental,\n\n00:20:33.608 --> 00:20:36.664\nnot owned by any single\ncountry or company,\n\n00:20:36.688 --> 00:20:40.108\nhoused in a neutral country,\nwith redundant backup\n\n00:20:40.132 --> 00:20:43.299\nin a different time zone\nand a different continent.\n\n00:20:44.093 --> 00:20:46.086\nAnd let's build it on GPHIN.\n\n00:20:46.110 --> 00:20:47.492\nLet's start with GPHIN.\n\n00:20:48.008 --> 00:20:50.922\nLet's increase the websites\nthat they crawl\n\n00:20:50.946 --> 00:20:52.934\nfrom 20,000 to 20 million.\n\n00:20:53.456 --> 00:20:55.965\nLet's increase the languages they crawl\n\n00:20:55.989 --> 00:20:58.782\nfrom seven to 70, or more.\n\n00:20:59.131 --> 00:21:02.671\nLet's build in outbound\nconfirmation messages,\n\n00:21:02.695 --> 00:21:05.959\nusing text messages or SMS\nor instant messaging\n\n00:21:05.983 --> 00:21:08.793\nto find out from people\nwho are within 100 meters\n\n00:21:08.817 --> 00:21:10.568\nof the rumor that you hear,\n\n00:21:10.592 --> 00:21:11.934\nif it is, in fact, valid.\n\n00:21:11.958 --> 00:21:14.199\nAnd let's add satellite confirmation.\n\n00:21:14.572 --> 00:21:18.479\nAnd we'll add Gapminder's\namazing graphics to the front end.\n\n00:21:18.503 --> 00:21:22.421\nAnd we'll grow it\nas a moral force in the world,\n\n00:21:22.445 --> 00:21:24.537\nfinding out those terrible things\n\n00:21:24.561 --> 00:21:26.648\nbefore anybody else knows about them,\n\n00:21:26.672 --> 00:21:29.098\nand sending our response to them,\n\n00:21:29.122 --> 00:21:32.636\nso that next year,\ninstead of us meeting here,\n\n00:21:32.660 --> 00:21:36.214\nlamenting how many terrible things\nthere are in the world,\n\n00:21:36.238 --> 00:21:37.976\nwe will have pulled together,\n\n00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:42.879\nused the unique skills\nand the magic of this community,\n\n00:21:42.903 --> 00:21:46.325\nand be proud that we have done\neverything we can to stop

before anyone else can see it?\n\n00:22:31.436 --> 00:22:34.293\nGive an example of how\nthat could possibly be true.\n\n00:22:35.132 --> 00:22:38.069\nLarry Brilliant: You're not mad\nabout the

--> 00:22:45.499\nI hope you'll go and meet him\nin the dinner afterwards and talk to him.\n\n00:22:45.523 --> 00:22:48.076\nWhen he started GPHIN --\n\n00:22:48.100 --> 00:22:52.496\nIn 1997, there was an outbreak\nof bird flu -- H5N1.\n\n00:22:52.520 --> 00:22:53.807\nIt was in Hong Kong.\n\n00:22:53.831 --> 00:22:57.013\nAnd a remarkable doctor in Hong Kong\nresponded immediately,\n\n00:22:57.037 --> 00:23:01.854\nby slaughtering 1.5 million\nchickens and birds,\n\n00:23:01.878 --> 00:23:04.766\nand they stopped\nthat outbreak in its tracks.\n\n00:23:04.790 --> 00:23:08.002\nImmediate detection, immediate response.\n\n00:23:08.026 --> 00:23:09.520\nThen a number of years went by,\n\n00:23:09.544 --> 00:23:11.828\nand there were a lot\nof rumors about bird flu.\n\n00:23:12.542 --> 00:23:16.330\nRon and his team in Ottawa\nbegan to crawl the web --\n\n00:23:16.354 --> 00:23:21.544\nonly crawling 20,000 different websites,\nmostly periodicals --\n\n00:23:21.568 --> 00:23:24.791\nand they read about\nand heard about a concern,\n\n00:23:24.815 --> 00:23:28.634\nof a lot of children who had high fever\nand symptoms of bird flu.\n\n00:23:29.571 --> 00:23:31.472\nThey reported this to WHO.\n\n00:23:32.119 --> 00:23:34.131\nWHO took a little while taking action,\n\n00:23:34.155 --> 00:23:38.814\nbecause WHO will only receive\na report from a government,\n\n00:23:38.838 --> 00:23:40.504\nbecause it's the United Nations.\n\n00:23:41.354 --> 00:23:44.756\nBut they were able to point\nto WHO and let them know\n\n00:23:44.780 --> 00:23:49.245\nthat there was this surprising\nand unexplained cluster of illnesses\n\n00:23:49.269 --> 00:23:50.673\nthat looked like bird flu.\n\n00:23:51.038 --> 00:23:52.772\nThat turned out to be SARS.\n\n00:23:52.796 --> 00:23:55.168\nThat's how the world found out about SARS.\n\n00:23:55.763 --> 00:23:58.673\nAnd because of that,\nwe were able to stop SARS.\n\n00:23:58.697 --> 00:24:02.275\nNow, what's really important is that,\nbefore there was GPHIN,\n\n00:24:02.299 --> 00:24:06.514\n100 percent of all the world's\nreports of bad things --\n\n00:24:06.538 --> 00:24:08.206\nwhether you're talking about famine\n\n00:24:08.230 --> 00:24:11.308\nor you're talking about bird flu\nor you're talking about Ebola --\n\n00:24:11.332 --> 00:24:14.071\n100 percent of all those reports\ncame from nations.\n\n00:24:14.484 --> 00:24:16.143\nThe moment these guys in Ottawa --\n\n00:24:16.167 --> 00:24:20.548\non a budget of 800,000 dollars\na year -- got cracking,\n\n00:24:20.572 --> 00:24:24.704\n75 percent of all the reports\nin the world came from GPHIN,\n\n00:24:24.728 --> 00:24:27.092\n25 percent of all the reports in the world\n\n00:24:27.116 --> 00:24:29.173\ncame from all the other 180 nations.\n\n00:24:30.474 --> 00:24:32.442\nNow, here's what's really interesting:\n\n00:24:32.466 --> 00:24:35.109\nafter they'd been working\nfor a couple years,\n\n00:24:35.133 --> 00:24:37.231\nwhat do you think happened\nto those nations?\n\n00:24:37.255 --> 00:24:38.438\nThey felt pretty stupid.\n\n00:24:38.462 --> 00:24:40.675\nSo they started sending in\ntheir reports early.\n\n00:24:40.699 --> 00:24:44.555\nAnd now, their reporting percentage\nis down to 50 percent,\n\n00:24:44.579 --> 00:24:46.997\nbecause other nations\nhave started to report.\n\n00:24:47.021 --> 00:24:51.187\nSo, can you find diseases\nearly by crawling the web?\n\n00:24:51.211 --> 00:24:52.392\nOf course you can.\n\n00:24:52.783 --> 00:24:55.631\nCan you find it even earlier\nthan GPHIN does now?\n\n00:24:55.655 --> 00:24:56.806\nOf course you can.\n\n00:24:56.830 --> 00:25:01.435\nYou saw that they found SARS\nusing their Chinese web crawler\n\n00:25:01.459 --> 00:25:06.402\na full six weeks before they found it\nusing their English web crawler.\n\n00:25:06.751 --> 00:25:09.140\nWell, they're only crawling\nin seven languages.\n\n00:25:09.164 --> 00:25:11.670\nThese bad viruses really\ndon't have any intention\n\n00:25:11.694 --> 00:25:14.152\nof showing up first in English\nor Spanish or French.\n\n00:25:14.176 --> 00:25:16.175\n(Laughter)\n\n00:25:16.199 --> 00:25:20.683\nSo yes, I want to take GPHIN,\nI want to build on it.\n\n00:25:21.270 --> 00:25:24.622\nI want to add all the languages\nof the world that we possibly can.\n\n00:25:24.646 --> 00:25:26.934\nI want to make this open to everybody,\n\n00:25:26.958 --> 00:25:29.934\nso that the health officer\nin Nairobi or in Patna, Bihar\n\n00:25:29.958 --> 00:25:34.252\nwill have as much access to it\nas the folks in Ottawa or in CDC.\n\n00:25:34.682 --> 00:25:37.086\nAnd I want to make it part of our culture\n\n00:25:37.110 --> 00:25:40.697\nthat there is a community of people\nwho are watching out\n\n00:25:40.721 --> 00:25:42.934\nfor the worst nightmares of humanity,\n\n00:25:42.958 --> 00:25:44.958\nand that it's accessible to everyone."}, {"title": "The radical promise of the multi-touch interface", "duration": "527", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/jeff_han_demos_his_breakthrough_touchscreen", "transcript": "I'm really excited to be here today. I'll show you some stuff that's just ready to come out of the lab, literally, and I'm really glad that you guys are going to be among the first to see it in person, because I really think this is going to really change the way we interact with machines from this point on.Now, this is a rear-projected drafting table. It's about 36 inches wide and it's equipped with a multi-touch sensor. Normal touch sensors that you see, like on a kiosk or interactive whiteboards, can only register one point of contact at a time. This thing allows you to have multiple points at the same time. They can use both my hands; I can use chording actions; I can just go right up and use all 10 fingers if I wanted to. You know, like that.Now, multi-touch sensing isn't completely new. People like Bill Buxton have been playing around with it in the '80s. However, the approach I built here is actually high-resolution, low-cost, and probably most importantly, very scalable. So, the technology, you know, isn't the most exciting thing here right now, other than probably its newfound accessibility. What's really interesting here is what you can do with it and the kind of interfaces you can build on top of it. So let's see.So, for instance, we have a lava lamp application here. Now, you can see, I can use both of my hands to kind of squeeze and put the blobs together. I can inject heat into the system here, or I can pull it apart with two of my fingers. It's completely intuitive; there's no instruction manual. The interface just kind of disappears. This started out as a screensaver app that one of the Ph.D. students in our lab, Ilya Rosenberg, made. But I think its true identity comes out here.Now what's great about a multi-touch sensor is that, you know, I could be doing this with as many fingers here, but of course multi-touch also inherently means multi-user. Chris could be interacting with another part of Lava, while I play around with it here. You can imagine a new kind of sculpting tool, where I'm kind of warming something up, making it malleable, and then letting it cool down and solidifying in a certain state. Google should have something like this in their lobby.(Laughter)I'll show you a little more of a concrete example here, as this thing loads. This is a photographer's light-box application. Again, I can use both of my hands to interact and move photos around. But what's even cooler is that if I have two fingers, I can actually grab a photo and then stretch it out like that really easily. I can pan, zoom and rotate it effortlessly. I can do that grossly with both of my hands, or I can do it just with two fingers on each of my hands together. If I grab the canvas, I can do the same thing \u2014 stretch it out. I can do it simultaneously, holding this down, and gripping on another one, stretching this out.Again, the interface just disappears here. There's no manual. This is exactly what you expect, especially if you haven't interacted with a computer before. Now, when you have initiatives like the $100 laptop, I kind of cringe at the idea of introducing a whole new generation to computing with this standard mouse-and-windows-pointer interface. This is something that I think is really the way we should be interacting with machines from now on.(Applause)Now, of course, I can bring up a keyboard.(Laughter) And I can bring that around, put that up there. Obviously, this is a standard keyboard, but of course I can rescale it to make it work well for my hands. That's really important, because there's no reason in this day and age that we should be conforming to a physical device. That leads to bad things, like RSI. We have so much technology nowadays that these interfaces should start conforming to us. There's so little applied now to actually improving the way we interact with interfaces from this point on. This keyboard is probably actually the really wrong direction to go. You can imagine, in the future, as we develop this kind of technology, a keyboard that kind of automatically drifts as your hand moves away, and really intelligently anticipates which key you're trying to stroke. So \u2014 again, isn't this great?(Laughter)Audience: Where's your lab?Jeff Han: I'm a research scientist at NYU in New York.Here's an example of another kind of app. I can make these little fuzz balls. It'll remember the strokes I'm making. Of course I can do it with all my hands. It's pressure-sensitive. What's neat about that is, I showed that two-finger gesture that zooms in really quickly. Because you don't have to switch to a hand tool or the magnifying glass tool, you can just continuously make things in real multiple scales, all at the same time. I can create big things out here, but I can go back and really quickly go back to where I started, and make even smaller things here.This is going to be really important as we start getting to things like data visualization. For instance, I think we all enjoyed Hans Rosling's talk, and he really emphasized the fact I've been thinking about for a long time: We have all this great data, but for some reason, it's just sitting there. We're not accessing it. And one of the reasons why I think that is will be helped by things like graphics and visualization and inference tools, but I also think a big part of it is going to be having better interfaces, to be able to drill down into this kind of data, while still thinking about the big picture here.Let me show you another app here. This is called WorldWind. It's done by NASA. We've all seen Google Earth; this is an open-source version of that. There are plug-ins to be able to load in different data sets that NASA's collected over the years. As you can see, I can use the same two-fingered gestures to go down and go in really seamlessly. There's no interface, again. It really allows anybody to kind of go in \u2014 and it just does what you'd expect, you know? Again, there's just no interface here. The interface just disappears. I can switch to different data views. That's what's neat about this app here. NASA's really cool. These hyper-spectral images are false-colored so you can \u2014 it's really good for determining vegetative use. Well, let's go back to this.The great thing about mapping applications \u2014 it's not really 2D, it's 3D. So, again, with a multi-point interface, you can do a gesture like this \u2014 so you can be able to tilt around like that \u2014(Surprised laughter)It's not just simply relegated to a kind of 2D panning and motion. This gesture is just putting two fingers down \u2014 it's defining an axis of tilt \u2014 and I can tilt up and down that way. We just came up with that on the spot, it's probably not the right thing to do, but there's such interesting things you can do with this interface. It's just so much fun playing around with it, too.(Laughter)And so the last thing I want to show you is \u2014 I'm sure we can all think of a lot of entertainment apps that you can do with this thing. I'm more interested in the creative applications we can do with this. Now, here's a simple application here \u2014 I can draw out a curve. And when I close it, it becomes a character. But the neat thing about it is I can add control points. And then what I can do is manipulate them with both of my fingers at the same time. And you notice what it does. It's kind of a puppeteering thing, where I can use as many fingers as I have to draw and make \u2014Now, there's a lot of actual math going on under here for this to control this mesh and do the right thing. This technique of being able to manipulate a mesh here, with multiple control points, is actually state of the art. It was released at SIGGRAPH last year. It's a great example of the kind of research I really love: all this compute power to make things do the right things, intuitive things, to do exactly what you expect.So, multi-touch interaction research is a very active field right now in HCI. I'm not the only one doing it, a lot of other people are getting into it. This kind of technology is going to let even more people get into it, I'm looking forward to interacting with all of you over the next few days and seeing how it can apply to your respective fields.Thank you.(Applause)", "id": 65, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:12.053 --> 00:00:13.832\nI'm really excited to be here today.\n\n00:00:13.856 -->

machines from this point on.\n\n00:00:27.297 --> 00:00:29.972\nNow, this is a rear-projected\ndrafting table.\n\n00:00:29.996 --> 00:00:31.218\nIt's about 36 inches wide\n\n00:00:31.242 --> 00:00:33.325\nand it's equipped\nwith a multi-touch sensor.\n\n00:00:33.349 --> 00:00:34.993\nNormal touch sensors that you see,\n\n00:00:35.017 --> 00:00:37.154\nlike on a kiosk\nor interactive whiteboards,\n\n00:00:37.178 --> 00:00:39.761\ncan only register one point\nof contact at a time.\n\n00:00:40.095 --> 00:00:43.810\nThis thing allows you to have\nmultiple points at the same time.\n\n00:00:43.834 --> 00:00:47.148\nThey can use both my hands;\nI can use chording actions;\n\n00:00:47.172 --> 00:00:50.109\nI can just go right up and use\nall 10 fingers if I wanted to.\n\n00:00:50.555 --> 00:00:51.712\nYou know, like that.\n\n00:00:51.736 --> 00:00:56.279\nNow, multi-touch sensing\nisn't completely new.\n\n00:00:56.303 --> 00:00:59.556\nPeople like Bill Buxton have been\nplaying around with it in the '80s.\n\n00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:03.608\nHowever, the approach I built here\nis actually high-resolution,\n\n00:01:03.632 --> 00:01:06.608\nlow-cost, and probably\nmost importantly, very scalable.\n\n00:01:06.958 --> 00:01:09.295\nSo, the technology, you know,\n\n00:01:09.319 --> 00:01:11.765\nisn't the most exciting thing\nhere right now,\n\n00:01:11.789 --> 00:01:14.107\nother than probably\nits newfound accessibility.\n\n00:01:14.131 --> 00:01:17.656\nWhat's really interesting here\nis what you can do with it\n\n00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:20.298\nand the kind of interfaces\nyou can build on top of it.\n\n00:01:21.099 --> 00:01:22.235\nSo let's see.\n\n00:01:23.069 --> 00:01:27.382\nSo, for instance, we have\na lava lamp application here.\n\n00:01:27.406 --> 00:01:29.108\nNow, you can see,\n\n00:01:29.132 --> 00:01:32.561\nI can use both of my hands to kind\nof squeeze and put the blobs together.\n\n00:01:32.585 --> 00:01:35.128\nI can inject heat into the system here,\n\n00:01:35.152 --> 00:01:37.334\nor I can pull it apart\nwith two of my fingers.\n\n00:01:37.358 --> 00:01:40.088\nIt's completely intuitive;\nthere's no instruction manual.\n\n00:01:40.112 --> 00:01:41.934\nThe interface just kind of disappears.\n\n00:01:41.958 --> 00:01:43.878\nThis started out as a screensaver app\n\n00:01:43.902 --> 00:01:46.949\nthat one of the Ph.D. students\nin our lab, Ilya Rosenberg, made.\n\n00:01:46.973 --> 00:01:50.994\nBut I think its true identity\ncomes out here.\n\n00:01:52.111 --> 00:01:55.034\nNow what's great about a multi-touch\nsensor is that, you know,\n\n00:01:55.058 --> 00:01:57.795\nI could be doing this\nwith as many fingers here,\n\n00:01:57.819 --> 00:02:00.797\nbut of course multi-touch\nalso inherently means multi-user.\n\n00:02:00.821 --> 00:02:03.320\nChris could be interacting\nwith another part of Lava,\n\n00:02:03.344 --> 00:02:04.978\nwhile I play around with it here.\n\n00:02:05.002 --> 00:02:07.098\nYou can imagine\na new kind of sculpting tool,\n\n00:02:07.122 --> 00:02:10.101\nwhere I'm kind of warming something up,\nmaking it malleable,\n\n00:02:10.125 --> 00:02:13.383\nand then letting it cool down\nand solidifying in a certain state.\n\n00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:20.617\nGoogle should have\nsomething like this in their lobby.\n\n00:02:20.641 --> 00:02:25.934\n(Laughter)\n\n00:02:25.958 --> 00:02:29.230\nI'll show you a little more\nof a concrete example here,\n\n00:02:29.254 --> 00:02:30.587\nas this thing loads.\n\n00:02:31.139 --> 00:02:33.856\nThis is a photographer's\nlight-box application.\n\n00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:37.857\nAgain, I can use both of my hands\nto interact and move photos around.\n\n00:02:37.881 --> 00:02:41.436\nBut what's even cooler\nis that if I have two fingers,\n\n00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:45.590\nI can actually grab a photo and then\nstretch it out like that really easily.\n\n00:02:45.614 --> 00:02:49.080\nI can pan, zoom\nand rotate it effortlessly.\n\n00:02:49.104 --> 00:02:51.435\nI can do that grossly\nwith both of my hands,\n\n00:02:51.459 --> 00:02:54.663\nor I can do it just with two fingers\non each of my hands together.\n\n00:02:54.687 --> 00:02:57.714\nIf I grab the canvas, I can do\nthe same thing -- stretch it out.\n\n00:02:57.738 --> 00:02:59.897\nI can do it simultaneously,\nholding this down,\n\n00:02:59.921 --> 00:03:02.220\nand gripping on another one,\nstretching this out.\n\n00:03:02.244 --> 00:03:04.472\nAgain, the interface just disappears here.\n\n00:03:04.496 --> 00:03:05.529\nThere's no manual.\n\n00:03:05.553 --> 00:03:07.855\nThis is exactly what you expect,\n\n00:03:07.879 --> 00:03:10.934\nespecially if you haven't interacted\nwith a computer before.\n\n00:03:10.958 --> 00:03:13.662\nNow, when you have initiatives\nlike the $100 laptop,\n\n00:03:13.686 --> 00:03:15.219\nI kind of cringe at the idea\n\n00:03:15.243 --> 00:03:17.820\nof introducing a whole new\ngeneration to computing\n\n00:03:17.844 --> 00:03:20.582\nwith this standard\nmouse-and-windows-pointer interface.\n\n00:03:20.606 --> 00:03:23.742\nThis is something that I think\nis really the way\n\n00:03:23.766 --> 00:03:26.407\nwe should be interacting\nwith machines from now on.\n\n00:03:26.431 --> 00:03:32.934\n(Applause)\n\n00:03:32.958 --> 00:03:34.958\nNow, of course, I can bring up a keyboard.\n\n00:03:34.982 --> 00:03:37.280\n(Laughter)\n\n00:03:39.958 --> 00:03:42.703\nAnd I can bring that around,\nput that up there.\n\n00:03:43.171 --> 00:03:45.029\nObviously, this is a standard keyboard,\n\n00:03:45.053 --> 00:03:48.135\nbut of course I can rescale it\nto make it work well for my hands.\n\n00:03:48.159 --> 00:03:51.492\nThat's really important, because\nthere's no reason in this day and age\n\n00:03:51.516 --> 00:03:53.856\nthat we should be conforming\nto a physical device.\n\n00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:55.627\nThat leads to bad things, like RSI.\n\n00:03:55.651 --> 00:03:58.428\nWe have so much technology nowadays\n\n00:03:58.452 --> 00:04:02.481\nthat these interfaces\nshould start conforming to us.\n\n00:04:02.505 --> 00:04:06.482\nThere's so little applied now\nto actually improving\n\n00:04:06.506 --> 00:04:09.085\nthe way we interact with interfaces\nfrom this point on.\n\n00:04:09.109 --> 00:04:12.300\nThis keyboard is probably actually\nthe really wrong direction to go.\n\n00:04:12.324 --> 00:04:15.626\nYou can imagine, in the future,\nas we develop this kind of technology,\n\n00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:19.053\na keyboard that kind of automatically\ndrifts as your hand moves away,\n\n00:04:19.077 --> 00:04:22.592\nand really intelligently anticipates\nwhich key you're trying to stroke.\n\n00:04:23.435 --> 00:04:25.728\nSo -- again, isn't this great?\n\n00:04:27.009 --> 00:04:28.981\n(Laughter)\n\n00:04:29.005 --> 00:04:30.768\nAudience: Where's your lab?\n\n00:04:30.792 --> 00:04:33.364\nJeff Han: I'm a research scientist\nat NYU in New York.\n\n00:04:37.299 --> 00:04:40.934\nHere's an example of another kind of app.\nI can make these little fuzz balls.\n\n00:04:40.958 --> 00:04:43.292\nIt'll remember the strokes I'm making.\n\n00:04:43.316 --> 00:04:45.235\nOf course I can do it with all my hands.\n\n00:04:45.259 --> 00:04:46.550\nIt's pressure-sensitive.\n\n00:04:47.863 --> 00:04:49.419\nWhat's neat about that is,\n\n00:04:49.443 --> 00:04:52.408\nI showed that two-finger gesture\nthat zooms in really quickly.\n\n00:04:52.432 --> 00:04:54.639\nBecause you don't have\nto switch to a hand tool\n\n00:04:54.663 --> 00:04:56.069\nor the magnifying glass tool,\n\n00:04:56.093 --> 00:04:58.632\nyou can just continuously make things\n\n00:04:58.656 --> 00:05:01.010\nin real multiple scales,\nall at the same time.\n\n00:05:01.034 --> 00:05:03.047\nI can create big things out here,\n\n00:05:03.071 --> 00:05:05.169\nbut I can go back\nand really quickly go back\n\n00:05:05.193 --> 00:05:07.893\nto where I started,\nand make even smaller things here.\n\n00:05:09.229 --> 00:05:11.116\nThis is going to be really important\n\n00:05:11.140 --> 00:05:14.173\nas we start getting to things\nlike data visualization.\n\n00:05:14.197 --> 00:05:16.864\nFor instance, I think\nwe all enjoyed Hans Rosling's talk,\n\n00:05:16.888 --> 00:05:20.414\nand he really emphasized the fact\nI've been thinking about for a long time:\n\n00:05:20.438 --> 00:05:21.789\nWe have all this great data,\n\n00:05:21.813 --> 00:05:23.910\nbut for some reason,\nit's just sitting there.\n\n00:05:23.934 --> 00:05:25.053\nWe're not accessing it.\n\n00:05:25.077 --> 00:05:28.600\nAnd one of the reasons why I think that is\n\n00:05:28.624 --> 00:05:33.340\nwill be helped by things like graphics\nand visualization and inference tools,\n\n00:05:33.364 --> 00:05:35.225\nbut I also think a big part of it\n\n00:05:35.249 --> 00:05:37.305\nis going to be having better interfaces,\n\n00:05:37.329 --> 00:05:39.569\nto be able to drill down\ninto this kind of data,\n\n00:05:39.593 --> 00:05:41.931\nwhile still thinking\nabout the big picture here.\n\n00:05:42.418 --> 00:05:45.397\nLet me show you another app here.\nThis is called WorldWind.\n\n00:05:45.421 --> 00:05:46.560\nIt's done by NASA.\n\n00:05:46.584 --> 00:05:49.414\nWe've all seen Google Earth;\n\n00:05:49.438 --> 00:05:51.396\nthis is an open-source version of that.\n\n00:05:51.420 --> 00:05:54.944\nThere are plug-ins to be able\nto load in different data sets\n\n00:05:54.968 --> 00:05:56.767\nthat NASA's collected over the years.\n\n00:05:56.791 --> 00:05:59.411\nAs you can see, I can use\nthe same two-fingered gestures\n\n00:05:59.435 --> 00:06:01.917\nto go down and go in really seamlessly.\n\n00:06:01.941 --> 00:06:03.321\nThere's no interface, again.\n\n00:06:03.345 --> 00:06:06.616\nIt really allows anybody\nto kind of go in --\n\n00:06:06.640 --> 00:06:09.603\nand it just does\nwhat you'd expect, you know?\n\n00:06:09.627 --> 00:06:12.899\nAgain, there's just no interface here.\nThe interface just disappears.\n\n00:06:14.958 --> 00:06:16.834\nI can switch to different data views.\n\n00:06:16.858 --> 00:06:19.052\nThat's what's neat about this app here.\n\n00:06:19.076 --> 00:06:20.233\nNASA's really cool.\n\n00:06:20.257 --> 00:06:23.019\nThese hyper-spectral images\nare false-colored so you can --\n\n00:06:23.043 --> 00:06:26.986\nit's really good for determining\nvegetative use.\n\n00:06:27.845 --> 00:06:29.431\nWell, let's go back to this.\n\n00:06:32.270 --> 00:06:34.444\nThe great thing\nabout mapping applications --\n\n00:06:34.468 --> 00:06:35.958\nit's not really 2D, it's 3D.\n\n00:06:35.982 --> 00:06:39.474\nSo, again, with a multi-point interface,\nyou can do a gesture like this --\n\n00:06:39.498 --> 00:06:42.935\nso you can be able\nto tilt around like that --\n\n00:06:42.959 --> 00:06:44.833\n(Surprised laughter)\n\n00:06:44.857 --> 00:06:48.039\nIt's not just simply relegated\nto a kind of 2D panning and motion.\n\n00:06:48.063 --> 00:06:50.698\nThis gesture is just putting\ntwo fingers down --\n\n00:06:50.722 --> 00:06:54.375\nit's defining an axis of tilt --\nand I can tilt up and down that way.\n\n00:06:54.399 --> 00:06:56.477\nWe just came up with that on the spot,\n\n00:06:56.501 --> 00:06:58.438\nit's probably not the right thing to do,\n\n00:06:58.462 --> 00:07:01.691\nbut there's such interesting things\nyou can do with this interface.\n\n00:07:02.958 --> 00:07:05.892\nIt's just so much fun\nplaying around with it, too.\n\n00:07:05.916 --> 00:07:07.269\n(Laughter)\n\n00:07:07.293 --> 00:07:09.934\nAnd so the last thing\nI want to show you is --\n\n00:07:09.958 --> 00:07:12.635\nI'm sure we can all think\nof a lot of entertainment apps\n\n00:07:12.659 --> 00:07:14.183\nthat you can do with this thing.\n\n00:07:14.207 --> 00:07:18.257\nI'm more interested in the creative\napplications we can do with this.\n\n00:07:18.281 --> 00:07:21.518\nNow, here's a simple application here --\nI can draw out a curve.\n\n00:07:23.159 --> 00:07:26.425\nAnd when I close it,\nit becomes a character.\n\n00:07:26.743 --> 00:07:29.720\nBut the neat thing about it\nis I can add control points.\n\n00:07:29.744 --> 00:07:33.721\nAnd then what I can do is manipulate them\nwith both of my fingers at the same time.\n\n00:07:33.745 --> 00:07:35.648\nAnd you notice what it does.\n\n00:07:36.211 --> 00:07:38.766\nIt's kind of a puppeteering thing,\n\n00:07:38.790 --> 00:07:44.008\nwhere I can use as many fingers\nas I have to draw and make --\n\n00:07:50.232 --> 00:07:52.934\nNow, there's a lot of actual math\ngoing on under here\n\n00:07:52.958 --> 00:07:57.400\nfor this to control this mesh\nand do the right thing.\n\n00:07:58.141 --> 00:08:03.833\nThis technique of being able to manipulate\na mesh here, with multiple control points,\n\n00:08:03.857 --> 00:08:05.333\nis actually state of the art.\n\n00:08:05.357 --> 00:08:07.181\nIt was released at SIGGRAPH last year.\n\n00:08:07.205 --> 00:08:09.975\nIt's a great example\nof the kind of research I really love:\n\n00:08:09.999 --> 00:08:12.798\nall this compute power\nto make things do the right things,\n\n00:08:12.822 --> 00:08:15.543\nintuitive things,\nto do exactly what you expect.\n\n00:08:18.958 --> 00:08:23.616\nSo, multi-touch interaction research\nis a very active field right now in HCI.\n\n00:08:23.958 --> 00:08:27.434\nI'm not the only one doing it,\na lot of other people are getting into it.\n\n00:08:27.458 --> 00:08:30.703\nThis kind of technology is going to let\neven more people get into it,\n\n00:08:30.727 --> 00:08:34.219\nI'm looking forward to interacting\nwith all of you over the next few days\n\n00:08:34.243 --> 00:08:36.780\nand seeing how it can apply\nto your respective fields.\n\n00:08:36.804 --> 00:08:37.962\nThank you.\n\n00:08:37.986 --> 00:08:40.555\n(Applause)"}, {"title": "One Laptop per Child", "duration": "1057", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/nicholas_negroponte_on_one_laptop_per_child", "transcript": "I've been at MIT for 44 years. I went to TED I. There's only one other person here, I think, who did that. All the other TEDs \u2014 and I went to them all, under Ricky's regime \u2014 I talked about what the Media Lab was doing, which today has almost 500 people in it.And if you read the press, last week it actually said I quit the Media Lab. I didn't quit the Media Lab, I stepped down as chairman \u2014 which was a kind of ridiculous title, but someone else has taken it on \u2014 and one of the things you can do as a professor is you stay on as a professor. And I will now do for the rest of my life the One Laptop Per Child, which I've sort of been doing for a year and a half, anyway. So I'm going to tell you about this, use my 18 minutes to tell you why we're doing it, how we're doing it and then what we're doing. And at some point I'll even pass around what the $100 laptop might be like.I was asked by Chris to talk about some of the big issues, and so I figured I'd start with the three that at least drove me to do this. And the first is pretty obvious. It's amazing when you meet a head of state, and you say, \"What is your most precious natural resource?\" They will not say \"children\" at first, and then when you say, \"children,\" they will pretty quickly agree with you. And so that isn't very hard.(Laughter)Everybody agrees that whatever the solutions are to the big problems, they include education, sometimes can be just education and can never be without some element of education. So that's certainly part of it.And the third is a little bit less obvious. And that is that we all in this room learned how to walk, how to talk, not by being taught how to talk, or taught how to walk, but by interacting with the world, by having certain results as a consequence of being able to ask for something, or being able to stand up and reach it. Whereas at about the age six, we were told to stop learning that way, and that all learning from then on would happen through teaching, whether it's people standing up, like I'm doing now, or a book, or something. But it was really through teaching. And one of the things in general that computers have provided to learning is that it now includes a kind of learning which is a little bit more like walking and talking, in the sense that a lot of it is driven by the learner himself or herself.So with those as the principles \u2014 some of you may know Seymour Papert. This is back in 1982, when we were working in Senegal. Because some people think that the $100 laptop just happened a year ago, or two years ago, or we were struck by lightning \u2014 this actually has gone back a long time, and in fact, back to the '60s. Here we're in the '80s. Steve Jobs had given us some laptops. We were in Senegal. It didn't scale but it at least was bringing computers to developing countries and learning pretty quickly that these kids, even though English wasn't their language, the Latin alphabet barely was their language, but they could just swim like fish. They could play these like pianos.A little bit more recently, I got involved personally. And these are two anecdotes \u2014 one was in Cambodia, in a village that has no electricity, no water, no television, no telephone, but has broadband Internet now. And these kids, their first English word is \"Google\" and they only know Skype. They've never heard of telephony. They just use Skype. And they go home at night \u2014 they've got a broadband connection in a hut that doesn't have electricity. The parents love it, because when they open up the laptops, it's the brightest light source in the house. And talk about where metaphors and reality mix \u2014 this is the actual school.In parallel with this, Seymour Papert got the governor of Maine to legislate one laptop per child in the year 2002. Now at the time, I think it's fair to say that 80 percent of the teachers were \u2014 let me say, apprehensive. Really, they were actually against it. And they really preferred that the money would be used for higher salaries, more schools, whatever.And now, three and a half years later, guess what? They're reporting five things: drop of truancy to almost zero, attending parent-teacher meetings \u2014 which nobody did and now almost everybody does \u2014 drop in discipline problems, increase in student participation. Teachers are now saying it's kind of fun to teach. Kids are engaged \u2014 they have laptops! \u2014 and then the fifth, which interests me the most, is that the servers have to be turned off at certain times at night because the teachers are getting too much email from the kids asking them for help. So when you see that kind of thing \u2014 this is not something that you have to test. The days of pilot projects are over, when people say, \"We'd like to do three or four thousand in our country to see how it works.\" Screw you. Go to the back of the line and someone else will do it, and then when you figure out that this works, you can join as well. And this is what we're doing.(Laughter) (Applause)So, One Laptop Per Child was formed about a year and a half ago. It's a nonprofit association. It raised about 20 million dollars to do the engineering to just get this built, and then have it produced afterwards. Scale is truly important. And it's not important because you can buy components at a lower price, OK? It's because you can go to a manufacturer \u2014 and I will leave the name out \u2014 but we wanted a small display, doesn't have to have perfect color uniformity. It can even have a pixel or two missing. It doesn't have to be that bright. And this particular manufacturer said, \"We're not interested in that. We're interested in the living room. We're interested in perfect color uniformity. We're interested in big displays, bright displays. You're not part of our strategic plan.\" And I said, \"That's kind of too bad, because we need 100 million units a year.\"(Laughter)And they said, \"Oh, well, maybe we could become part of your strategic plan.\" And that's why scale counts. And that's why we will not launch this without five to 10 million units in the first run. And the idea is to launch with enough scale that the scale itself helps bring the price down, and that's why I said seven to 10 million there. And we're doing it without a sales-and-marketing team. I mean, you're looking at the sales-and-marketing team. We will do it by going to seven large countries and getting them to agree and launch it, and then the others can follow. We have partners. It's not hard to guess Google would be one. The others are all playing to pending. And this has been in the press a great deal. It's the so-called Green Machine that we introduced with Kofi Annan in November at the World Summit that was held in Tunisia.Now once people start looking at this, they say, \"Ah, this is a laptop project.\" Well, no, it's not a laptop project. It's an education project. And the fun part \u2014 and I'm quite focused on it \u2014 I tell people I used to be a light bulb, but now I'm a laser \u2014 I'm just going to get that thing built, and it turns out it's not so hard. Because laptop economics are the following: I say 50 percent here \u2014 it's more like 60, 60 percent of the cost of your laptop is sales, marketing, distribution and profit. Now we have none of those, OK? None of those figure into our cost, because first of all, we sell it at cost, and the governments distribute it. It gets distributed to the school system like a textbook. So that piece disappears. Then you have display and everything else. Now the display on your laptop costs, in rough numbers, 10 dollars a diagonal inch. That can drop to eight; it can drop to seven but it's not going to drop to two, or to one and a half, unless we do some pretty clever things. It's the rest \u2014 that little brown box \u2014 that is pretty fascinating, because the rest of your laptop is devoted to itself. It's a little bit like an obese person having to use most of their energy to move their obesity.(Laughter)And we have a situation today which is incredible. I've been using laptops since their inception. And my laptop runs slower, less reliably and less pleasantly than it ever has before. And this year is worse.(Applause)People clap, sometimes you even get standing ovations, and I say, \"What the hell's wrong with you? Why are we all sitting there?\" And somebody \u2014 to remain nameless \u2014 called our laptop a \"gadget\" recently. And I said, \"God, our laptop's going to go like a bat out of hell. When you open it up, it's going to go 'bing.'\" It'll be on. It'll be just like it was in 1985, when you bought an Apple Macintosh 512. It worked really well. And we've been going steadily downhill.Now, people ask all the time what it is. That's what it is. The two pieces that are probably notable: it'll be a mesh network, so when the kids open up their laptops, they all become a network, and then just need one or two points of backhaul. You can serve a couple of thousand kids with two megabits. So you really can bring into a village, and then the villages can connect themselves, and you really can do it quite well.The dual mode display \u2014 the idea is to have a display that both works outdoors \u2014 isn't it fun using your cell phone outdoors in the sunlight? Well, you can't see it. And one of the reasons you can't see it is because it's backlighting most of the time, most cell phones. Now, what we're doing is, we're doing one that will be both frontlit and backlit. And whether you manually switch it or you do it in the software is to be seen. But when it's backlit, it's color. And when it's frontlit, it's black and white at three times the resolution.Is it all worked out? No. That's why a lot of our people are more or less living in Taiwan right now. And in about 30 days, we'll know for sure whether this works. Probably the most important piece there is that the kids really can do the maintenance. And this is again something that people don't believe, but I really think it's quite true. That's the machine we showed in Tunis. This is more the direction that we're going to go. And it's something that we didn't think was possible. Now, I'm going to pass this around. This isn't a design, OK? So this is just a mechanical engineering sort of embodiment of it for you to play with. And it's clearly just a model. The working one is at MIT. I'm going to pass it to this handsome gentleman. At least you can decide whether it goes left or \u2014Chris Anderson: Before you do it, for the people down in simulcast \u2014Nicholas Negroponte: Sorry! I forgot. CA: Just show it off a bit.So wherever the camera is \u2014 OK, good point. Thank you, Chris.The idea was that it would be not only a laptop, but that it could transform into an electronic book. So it's sort of an electronic book. This is where when you go outside, it's in black and white. The games buttons are missing, but it'll also be a games machine, book machine. Set it up this way, and it's a television set. Etc., etc. \u2014 is that enough for simulcast? OK, sorry. I'll let Jim decide which way to send it afterwards. OK. Seven countries.(Laughter)I say \"maybe\" for Massachusetts, because they actually have to do a bid. By law you've got to bid, and so on and so forth. So I can't quite name them. In the other cases, they don't have to do bids. They can decide \u2014 it's the federal government in each case. It's kind of agonizing, because a lot of people say, \"Let's do it at the state level,\" because states are more nimble than the feds, just because of size. And yet we count. We're really dealing with the federal government. We're really dealing with ministries of education. And if you look at governments around the world, ministries of education tend to be the most conservative, and also the ones that have huge payrolls. Everybody thinks they know about education, a lot of culture is built into it as well. It's really hard. And so it's certainly the hard road. If you look at the countries, they're pretty geoculturally distributed.Have they all agreed? No, not completely. Probably Thailand, Brazil and Nigeria are the three that are the most active and most agreed. We're purposely not signing anything with anybody until we actually have the working ones. And since I visit each one of those countries within at least every three months, I'm just going around the world every three weeks. Here's sort of the schedule and I put at the bottom we might give some away free in two years at this meeting. Everybody says it's a $100 laptop \u2014 you can't do it. Well, guess what, we're not. We're coming in probably at 135, to start, then drift down. And that's very important, because so many things hit the market at a price and then drift up. It's kind of the loss leader, and then as soon as it looks interesting, it can't be afforded, or it can't be scaled out. So we're targeting 50 dollars in 2010.The gray market's a big issue. And one of the ways \u2014 just one \u2014 but one of the ways to help in the case of the gray market is to make something that is so utterly unique \u2014 It's a little bit like the fact that automobiles \u2014 thousands of automobiles are stolen every day in the United States. Not one single post-office truck is stolen.(Laughter)And why? Because there's no market for post-office trucks. It looks like a post-office truck. You can spray paint it. You can do anything you want. I just learned recently: in South Africa, no white Volvos are stolen. Period. None. Zero. So we want to make it very much like a white Volvo.Each government has a task force. This perhaps is less interesting, but we're trying to get the governments to all work together and it's not easy. The economics of this is to start with the federal governments and then later, to subsequently go to other \u2014 whether it's child-to-child funding, so a child in this country buys one for a child in the developing world, maybe of the same gender, maybe of the same age. An uncle gives a niece or a nephew that as a birthday present. I mean, there are all sorts of things that will happen, and they'll be very, very exciting.And everybody says \u2014 I say \u2014 it's an education project. Are we providing the software? The answer is: The system certainly has software, but no, we're not providing the education content. That is really done in the countries. But we are certainly constructionists. And we certainly believe in learning by doing and everything from Logo, which was started in 1968, to more modern things, like Scratch, if you've ever even heard of it, are very, very much part of it. And that's the rollout.Are we dreaming? Is this real? It actually is real. The only criticism, and people really don't want to criticize this, because it is a humanitarian effort, a nonprofit effort and to criticize it is a little bit stupid, actually.(Laughter)But the one thing that people could criticize was, \"Great idea, but these guys can't do it.\" And that could either mean these guys, professors and so on couldn't do it, or that it's not possible. Well, on December 12, a company called Quanta agreed to build it, and since they make about one-third of all the laptops on the planet today, that question disappeared. So it's not a matter of whether it's going to happen. It is going to happen. And if it comes out at 138 dollars, so what? If it comes out six months late, so what? That's a pretty soft landing.Thank you.(Applause)", "id": 41, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:11.958 --> 00:00:14.854\nI've been at MIT for 44 years.\n\n00:00:14.878 --> 00:00:16.814\nI went to TED I.\n\n00:00:16.838 --> 00:00:19.694\nThere's only one other person here,\nI think, who did that.\n\n00:00:19.718 --> 00:00:20.934\nAll the other TEDs --\n\n00:00:20.958 --> 00:00:23.214\nand I went to them all,\nunder Ricky's regime --\n\n00:00:23.238 --> 00:00:25.774\nI talked about\nwhat the Media Lab was doing,\n\n00:00:25.798 --> 00:00:28.814\nwhich today has almost 500 people in it.\n\n00:00:28.838 --> 00:00:30.254\nAnd if you read the press,\n\n00:00:30.278 --> 00:00:32.934\nlast week it actually said\nI quit the Media Lab.\n\n00:00:32.958 --> 00:00:37.134\nI didn't quit the Media Lab,\nI stepped down as chairman --\n\n00:00:37.158 --> 00:00:41.854\nwhich was a kind of ridiculous title,\nbut someone else has taken it on --\n\n00:00:41.878 --> 00:00:44.069\nand one of the things\nyou can do as a professor\n\n00:00:44.093 --> 00:00:45.934\nis you stay on as a professor.\n\n00:00:45.958 --> 00:00:50.214\nAnd I will now do for the rest of my life\nthe One Laptop Per Child,\n\n00:00:50.238 --> 00:00:53.254\nwhich I've sort of been doing\nfor a year and a half, anyway.\n\n00:00:53.278 --> 00:00:55.014\nSo I'm going to tell you about this,\n\n00:00:55.038 --> 00:00:59.134\nuse my 18 minutes\nto tell you why we're doing it,\n\n00:00:59.158 --> 00:01:01.334\nhow we're doing it\nand then what we're doing.\n\n00:01:01.358 --> 00:01:04.654\nAnd at some point I'll even pass around\n\n00:01:04.678 --> 00:01:08.598\nwhat the $100 laptop might be like.\n\n00:01:10.758 --> 00:01:13.614\nI was asked by Chris\nto talk about some of the big issues,\n\n00:01:13.638 --> 00:01:18.894\nand so I figured I'd start with the three\nthat at least drove me to do this.\n\n00:01:18.918 --> 00:01:21.734\nAnd the first is pretty obvious.\n\n00:01:21.758 --> 00:01:24.414\nIt's amazing when you meet\na head of state, and you say,\n\n00:01:24.438 --> 00:01:27.174\n\"What is your most precious\nnatural resource?\"\n\n00:01:27.198 --> 00:01:29.894\nThey will not say \"children\" at first,\n\n00:01:29.918 --> 00:01:34.173\nand then when you say, \"children,\"\nthey will pretty quickly agree with you.\n\n00:01:34.197 --> 00:01:36.214\nAnd so that isn't very hard.\n\n00:01:36.238 --> 00:01:38.934\n(Laughter)\n\n00:01:38.958 --> 00:01:44.014\nEverybody agrees that whatever\nthe solutions are to the big problems,\n\n00:01:44.038 --> 00:01:48.774\nthey include education,\nsometimes can be just education\n\n00:01:48.798 --> 00:01:52.094\nand can never be without\nsome element of education.\n\n00:01:52.118 --> 00:01:53.934\nSo that's certainly part of it.\n\n00:01:53.958 --> 00:01:56.334\nAnd the third\nis a little bit less obvious.\n\n00:01:56.358 --> 00:02:01.094\nAnd that is that we all in this room\nlearned how to walk, how to talk,\n\n00:02:01.118 --> 00:02:05.614\nnot by being taught how to talk,\nor taught how to walk,\n\n00:02:05.638 --> 00:02:07.334\nbut by interacting with the world,\n\n00:02:07.358 --> 00:02:11.494\nby having certain results as a consequence\nof being able to ask for something,\n\n00:02:11.518 --> 00:02:13.654\nor being able to stand up and reach it.\n\n00:02:13.678 --> 00:02:17.934\nWhereas at about the age six,\nwe were told to stop learning that way,\n\n00:02:17.958 --> 00:02:21.294\nand that all learning from then on\nwould happen through teaching,\n\n00:02:21.318 --> 00:02:23.747\nwhether it's people standing up,\nlike I'm doing now,\n\n00:02:23.771 --> 00:02:25.494\nor a book, or something.\n\n00:02:25.518 --> 00:02:27.454\nBut it was really through teaching.\n\n00:02:27.478 --> 00:02:32.654\nAnd one of the things in general\nthat computers have provided to learning\n\n00:02:32.678 --> 00:02:35.814\nis that it now includes a kind of learning\n\n00:02:35.838 --> 00:02:38.934\nwhich is a little bit more\nlike walking and talking,\n\n00:02:38.958 --> 00:02:45.574\nin the sense that a lot of it is driven\nby the learner himself or herself.\n\n00:02:45.598 --> 00:02:48.334\nSo with those as the principles --\n\n00:02:48.358 --> 00:02:50.374\nsome of you may know Seymour Papert.\n\n00:02:50.398 --> 00:02:53.934\nThis is back in 1982,\nwhen we were working in Senegal.\n\n00:02:53.958 --> 00:02:59.203\nBecause some people think that\nthe $100 laptop just happened a year ago,\n\n00:02:59.227 --> 00:03:02.414\nor two years ago,\nor we were struck by lightning --\n\n00:03:02.438 --> 00:03:07.494\nthis actually has gone back a long time,\nand in fact, back to the '60s.\n\n00:03:07.518 --> 00:03:09.054\nHere we're in the '80s.\n\n00:03:09.078 --> 00:03:13.334\nSteve Jobs had given us some laptops.\nWe were in Senegal.\n\n00:03:13.358 --> 00:03:14.614\nIt didn't scale\n\n00:03:14.638 --> 00:03:19.734\nbut it at least was bringing computers\nto developing countries\n\n00:03:19.758 --> 00:03:22.214\nand learning pretty quickly\nthat these kids,\n\n00:03:22.238 --> 00:03:24.238\neven though English wasn't their language,\n\n00:03:24.262 --> 00:03:27.494\nthe Latin alphabet\nbarely was their language,\n\n00:03:27.518 --> 00:03:29.854\nbut they could just swim like fish.\n\n00:03:29.878 --> 00:03:31.638\nThey could play these like pianos.\n\n00:03:33.318 --> 00:03:37.534\nA little bit more recently,\nI got involved personally.\n\n00:03:37.558 --> 00:03:39.294\nAnd these are two anecdotes --\n\n00:03:39.318 --> 00:03:41.934\none was in Cambodia,\n\n00:03:41.958 --> 00:03:46.374\nin a village that has no electricity,\nno water, no television, no telephone,\n\n00:03:46.398 --> 00:03:48.534\nbut has broadband Internet now.\n\n00:03:48.558 --> 00:03:52.054\nAnd these kids,\ntheir first English word is \"Google\"\n\n00:03:52.078 --> 00:03:54.414\nand they only know Skype.\n\n00:03:54.438 --> 00:03:56.054\nThey've never heard of telephony.\n\n00:03:56.078 --> 00:03:58.214\nThey just use Skype.\n\n00:03:58.238 --> 00:04:00.094\nAnd they go home at night --\n\n00:04:00.118 --> 00:04:03.934\nthey've got a broadband connection\nin a hut that doesn't have electricity.\n\n00:04:03.958 --> 00:04:06.720\nThe parents love it,\nbecause when they open up the laptops,\n\n00:04:06.744 --> 00:04:08.934\nit's the brightest light source\nin the house.\n\n00:04:08.958 --> 00:04:12.334\nAnd talk about\nwhere metaphors and reality mix --\n\n00:04:12.358 --> 00:04:14.958\nthis is the actual school.\n\n00:04:15.518 --> 00:04:20.614\nIn parallel with this,\nSeymour Papert got the governor of Maine\n\n00:04:20.638 --> 00:04:26.134\nto legislate one laptop per child\nin the year 2002.\n\n00:04:26.158 --> 00:04:31.254\nNow at the time, I think it's fair to say\nthat 80 percent of the teachers were --\n\n00:04:31.278 --> 00:04:32.854\nlet me say, apprehensive.\n\n00:04:32.878 --> 00:04:34.694\nReally, they were actually against it.\n\n00:04:34.718 --> 00:04:37.242\nAnd they really preferred\nthat the money would be used\n\n00:04:37.266 --> 00:04:39.654\nfor higher salaries,\nmore schools, whatever.\n\n00:04:39.678 --> 00:04:43.934\nAnd now, three and a half\nyears later, guess what?\n\n00:04:43.958 --> 00:04:50.174\nThey're reporting five things:\ndrop of truancy to almost zero,\n\n00:04:50.198 --> 00:04:52.123\nattending parent-teacher meetings --\n\n00:04:52.147 --> 00:04:54.654\nwhich nobody did\nand now almost everybody does --\n\n00:04:54.678 --> 00:04:58.574\ndrop in discipline problems,\nincrease in student participation.\n\n00:04:58.598 --> 00:05:01.014\nTeachers are now saying\nit's kind of fun to teach.\n\n00:05:01.038 --> 00:05:04.174\nKids are engaged -- they have laptops! --\n\n00:05:04.198 --> 00:05:06.654\nand then the fifth,\nwhich interests me the most,\n\n00:05:06.678 --> 00:05:09.894\nis that the servers have to be turned off\nat certain times at night\n\n00:05:09.918 --> 00:05:12.334\nbecause the teachers\nare getting too much email\n\n00:05:12.358 --> 00:05:14.334\nfrom the kids asking them for help.\n\n00:05:14.358 --> 00:05:16.134\nSo when you see that kind of thing --\n\n00:05:16.158 --> 00:05:18.206\nthis is not something\nthat you have to test.\n\n00:05:18.230 --> 00:05:20.934\nThe days of pilot projects are over,\nwhen people say,\n\n00:05:20.958 --> 00:05:25.014\n\"We'd like to do three or four thousand\nin our country to see how it works.\"\n\n00:05:25.038 --> 00:05:28.134\nScrew you. Go to the back of the line\nand someone else will do it,\n\n00:05:28.158 --> 00:05:32.694\nand then when you figure out\nthat this works, you can join as well.\n\n00:05:32.718 --> 00:05:35.294\nAnd this is what we're doing.\n\n00:05:35.318 --> 00:05:37.454\n(Laughter) (Applause)\n\n00:05:37.478 --> 00:05:42.454\nSo, One Laptop Per Child\nwas formed about a year and a half ago.\n\n00:05:42.478 --> 00:05:44.374\nIt's a nonprofit association.\n\n00:05:44.398 --> 00:05:46.334\nIt raised about 20 million dollars\n\n00:05:46.358 --> 00:05:50.174\nto do the engineering\nto just get this built,\n\n00:05:50.198 --> 00:05:52.854\nand then have it produced afterwards.\n\n00:05:52.878 --> 00:05:55.134\nScale is truly important.\n\n00:05:55.158 --> 00:06:01.454\nAnd it's not important because you can\nbuy components at a lower price, OK?\n\n00:06:01.478 --> 00:06:04.354\nIt's because you can go\nto a manufacturer --\n\n00:06:04.378 --> 00:06:06.020\nand I will leave the name out --\n\n00:06:06.044 --> 00:06:09.574\nbut we wanted a small display,\n\n00:06:09.598 --> 00:06:13.374\ndoesn't have to have\nperfect color uniformity.\n\n00:06:13.398 --> 00:06:15.760\nIt can even have a pixel or two missing.\n\n00:06:15.784 --> 00:06:18.334\nIt doesn't have to be that bright.\n\n00:06:18.358 --> 00:06:20.654\nAnd this particular manufacturer said,\n\n00:06:20.678 --> 00:06:23.821\n\"We're not interested in that.\nWe're interested in the living room.\n\n00:06:23.845 --> 00:06:26.014\nWe're interested\nin perfect color uniformity.\n\n00:06:26.038 --> 00:06:28.374\nWe're interested in big displays,\nbright displays.\n\n00:06:28.398 --> 00:06:31.174\nYou're not part of our strategic plan.\"\n\n00:06:31.198 --> 00:06:34.913\nAnd I said, \"That's kind of too bad,\nbecause we need 100 million units a year.\"\n\n00:06:34.937 --> 00:06:36.508\n(Laughter)\n\n00:06:36.532 --> 00:06:40.494\nAnd they said, \"Oh, well, maybe we could\nbecome part of your strategic plan.\"\n\n00:06:40.518 --> 00:06:42.934\nAnd that's why scale counts.\n\n00:06:42.958 --> 00:06:45.214\nAnd that's why we will not launch this\n\n00:06:45.238 --> 00:06:49.134\nwithout five to 10 million units\nin the first run.\n\n00:06:49.158 --> 00:06:52.134\nAnd the idea is\nto launch with enough scale\n\n00:06:52.158 --> 00:06:54.734\nthat the scale itself\nhelps bring the price down,\n\n00:06:54.758 --> 00:06:58.654\nand that's why I said\nseven to 10 million there.\n\n00:06:58.678 --> 00:07:02.094\nAnd we're doing it\nwithout a sales-and-marketing team.\n\n00:07:02.118 --> 00:07:04.694\nI mean, you're looking\nat the sales-and-marketing team.\n\n00:07:04.718 --> 00:07:08.734\nWe will do it by going\nto seven large countries\n\n00:07:08.758 --> 00:07:11.282\nand getting them to agree and launch it,\n\n00:07:11.306 --> 00:07:13.614\nand then the others can follow.\n\n00:07:13.638 --> 00:07:15.494\nWe have partners.\n\n00:07:15.518 --> 00:07:17.518\nIt's not hard to guess\nGoogle would be one.\n\n00:07:17.542 --> 00:07:21.174\nThe others are all playing to pending.\n\n00:07:21.198 --> 00:07:24.054\nAnd this has been\nin the press a great deal.\n\n00:07:24.078 --> 00:07:29.974\nIt's the so-called Green Machine\nthat we introduced with Kofi Annan\n\n00:07:29.998 --> 00:07:34.294\nin November at the World Summit\nthat was held in Tunisia.\n\n00:07:34.318 --> 00:07:39.934\nNow once people start looking at this,\nthey say, \"Ah, this is a laptop project.\"\n\n00:07:39.958 --> 00:07:43.254\nWell, no, it's not a laptop project.\nIt's an education project.\n\n00:07:43.278 --> 00:07:46.934\nAnd the fun part --\nand I'm quite focused on it --\n\n00:07:46.958 --> 00:07:51.054\nI tell people I used to be a light bulb,\nbut now I'm a laser --\n\n00:07:51.078 --> 00:07:57.174\nI'm just going to get that thing built,\nand it turns out it's not so hard.\n\n00:07:57.198 --> 00:08:00.414\nBecause laptop economics\nare the following:\n\n00:08:00.438 --> 00:08:02.934\nI say 50 percent here --\nit's more like 60,\n\n00:08:02.958 --> 00:08:05.014\n60 percent of the cost of your laptop\n\n00:08:05.038 --> 00:08:07.894\nis sales, marketing,\ndistribution and profit.\n\n00:08:07.918 --> 00:08:10.254\nNow we have none of those, OK?\n\n00:08:10.278 --> 00:08:13.214\nNone of those figure into our cost,\n\n00:08:13.238 --> 00:08:17.454\nbecause first of all, we sell it at cost,\nand the governments distribute it.\n\n00:08:17.478 --> 00:08:21.734\nIt gets distributed\nto the school system like a textbook.\n\n00:08:21.758 --> 00:08:23.894\nSo that piece disappears.\n\n00:08:23.918 --> 00:08:26.734\nThen you have display and everything else.\n\n00:08:26.758 --> 00:08:29.614\nNow the display on your laptop costs,\n\n00:08:29.638 --> 00:08:34.774\nin rough numbers,\n10 dollars a diagonal inch.\n\n00:08:34.798 --> 00:08:36.934\nThat can drop to eight;\nit can drop to seven\n\n00:08:36.958 --> 00:08:39.934\nbut it's not going to drop to two,\nor to one and a half,\n\n00:08:39.958 --> 00:08:42.718\nunless we do some pretty clever things.\n\n00:08:44.038 --> 00:08:48.214\nIt's the rest -- that little brown box --\nthat is pretty fascinating,\n\n00:08:48.238 --> 00:08:53.654\nbecause the rest of your laptop\nis devoted to itself.\n\n00:08:53.678 --> 00:08:56.294\nIt's a little bit like an obese person\n\n00:08:56.318 --> 00:08:59.454\nhaving to use most of their energy\nto move their obesity.\n\n00:08:59.478 --> 00:09:00.934\n(Laughter)\n\n00:09:00.958 --> 00:09:06.734\nAnd we have a situation today\nwhich is incredible.\n\n00:09:06.758 --> 00:09:09.734\nI've been using laptops\nsince their inception.\n\n00:09:09.758 --> 00:09:15.094\nAnd my laptop runs slower,\nless reliably and less pleasantly\n\n00:09:15.118 --> 00:09:17.654\nthan it ever has before.\n\n00:09:17.678 --> 00:09:19.174\nAnd this year is worse.\n\n00:09:19.198 --> 00:09:20.574\n(Applause)\n\n00:09:20.598 --> 00:09:23.894\nPeople clap, sometimes\nyou even get standing ovations,\n\n00:09:23.918 --> 00:09:27.614\nand I say, \"What the hell's wrong\nwith you? Why are we all sitting there?\"\n\n00:09:27.638 --> 00:09:33.974\nAnd somebody -- to remain nameless --\ncalled our laptop a \"gadget\" recently.\n\n00:09:33.998 --> 00:09:37.614\nAnd I said, \"God, our laptop's going to go\nlike a bat out of hell.\n\n00:09:37.638 --> 00:09:39.834\nWhen you open it up,\nit's going to go 'bing.'\"\n\n00:09:39.858 --> 00:09:41.134\nIt'll be on.\n\n00:09:41.158 --> 00:09:44.934\nIt'll be just like it was in 1985,\n\n00:09:44.958 --> 00:09:49.654\nwhen you bought an Apple Macintosh 512.\n\n00:09:49.678 --> 00:09:51.414\nIt worked really well.\n\n00:09:51.438 --> 00:09:54.534\nAnd we've been going steadily downhill.\n\n00:09:54.558 --> 00:09:58.494\nNow, people ask all the time what it is.\n\n00:09:58.518 --> 00:10:00.574\nThat's what it is.\n\n00:10:00.598 --> 00:10:05.894\nThe two pieces that are probably notable:\nit'll be a mesh network,\n\n00:10:05.918 --> 00:10:09.534\nso when the kids open up their laptops,\nthey all become a network,\n\n00:10:09.558 --> 00:10:12.374\nand then just need\none or two points of backhaul.\n\n00:10:12.398 --> 00:10:15.574\nYou can serve a couple of thousand kids\nwith two megabits.\n\n00:10:15.598 --> 00:10:18.654\nSo you really can bring into a village,\n\n00:10:18.678 --> 00:10:20.974\nand then the villages\ncan connect themselves,\n\n00:10:20.998 --> 00:10:24.054\nand you really can do it quite well.\n\n00:10:24.078 --> 00:10:26.054\nThe dual mode display --\n\n00:10:26.078 --> 00:10:30.774\nthe idea is to have a display\nthat both works outdoors --\n\n00:10:30.798 --> 00:10:34.214\nisn't it fun using your cell phone\noutdoors in the sunlight?\n\n00:10:34.238 --> 00:10:35.774\nWell, you can't see it.\n\n00:10:35.798 --> 00:10:37.974\nAnd one of the reasons you can't see it\n\n00:10:37.998 --> 00:10:42.054\nis because it's backlighting\nmost of the time, most cell phones.\n\n00:10:42.078 --> 00:10:46.734\nNow, what we're doing is, we're doing one\nthat will be both frontlit and backlit.\n\n00:10:46.758 --> 00:10:50.534\nAnd whether you manually switch it\nor you do it in the software\n\n00:10:50.558 --> 00:10:52.054\nis to be seen.\n\n00:10:52.078 --> 00:10:53.934\nBut when it's backlit, it's color.\n\n00:10:53.958 --> 00:10:56.014\nAnd when it's frontlit,\nit's black and white\n\n00:10:56.038 --> 00:10:58.014\nat three times the resolution.\n\n00:10:58.038 --> 00:11:00.494\nIs it all worked out? No.\n\n00:11:00.518 --> 00:11:05.774\nThat's why a lot of our people are\nmore or less living in Taiwan right now.\n\n00:11:05.798 --> 00:11:10.014\nAnd in about 30 days,\nwe'll know for sure whether this works.\n\n00:11:10.038 --> 00:11:14.254\nProbably the most important piece there\n\n00:11:14.278 --> 00:11:17.414\nis that the kids\nreally can do the maintenance.\n\n00:11:17.438 --> 00:11:20.574\nAnd this is again something\nthat people don't believe,\n\n00:11:20.598 --> 00:11:22.265\nbut I really think it's quite true.\n\n00:11:23.838 --> 00:11:28.734\nThat's the machine we showed in Tunis.\n\n00:11:28.758 --> 00:11:31.534\nThis is more the direction\nthat we're going to go.\n\n00:11:31.558 --> 00:11:34.894\nAnd it's something\nthat we didn't think was possible.\n\n00:11:34.918 --> 00:11:38.254\nNow, I'm going to pass this around.\n\n00:11:38.278 --> 00:11:40.454\nThis isn't a design, OK?\n\n00:11:40.478 --> 00:11:45.174\nSo this is just a mechanical\nengineering sort of embodiment of it\n\n00:11:45.198 --> 00:11:46.734\nfor you to play with.\n\n00:11:46.758 --> 00:11:48.614\nAnd it's clearly just a model.\n\n00:11:48.638 --> 00:11:51.334\nThe working one is at MIT.\n\n00:11:51.358 --> 00:11:54.214\nI'm going to pass it\nto this handsome gentleman.\n\n00:11:54.238 --> 00:11:56.694\nAt least you can decide\nwhether it goes left or --\n\n00:11:56.718 --> 00:12:00.018\nChris Anderson: Before you do it,\nfor the people down in simulcast --\n\n00:12:00.042 --> 00:12:03.104\nNicholas Negroponte: Sorry! I forgot.\nCA: Just show it off a bit.\n\n00:12:03.128 --> 00:12:06.134\nSo wherever the camera is --\nOK, good point. Thank you, Chris.\n\n00:12:06.158 --> 00:12:09.734\nThe idea was that\nit would be not only a laptop,\n\n00:12:09.758 --> 00:12:13.334\nbut that it could transform\ninto an electronic book.\n\n00:12:13.358 --> 00:12:15.025\nSo it's sort of an electronic book.\n\n00:12:15.049 --> 00:12:17.811\nThis is where when you go outside,\nit's in black and white.\n\n00:12:17.835 --> 00:12:19.614\nThe games buttons are missing,\n\n00:12:19.638 --> 00:12:21.933\nbut it'll also be a games machine,\n\n00:12:21.957 --> 00:12:23.294\nbook machine.\n\n00:12:23.318 --> 00:12:25.814\nSet it up this way,\nand it's a television set.\n\n00:12:25.838 --> 00:12:29.958\nEtc., etc. -- is that enough\nfor simulcast?

I'm Sirena. I'm 11 years old and from Connecticut. (Audience cheers)(Applause)Well, I'm not really sure why I'm here.(Laughter)I mean, what does this have to do with technology, entertainment and design? Well, I count my iPod, cellphone and computer as technology, but this has nothing to do with that.So I did a little research on it. Well, this is what I found. Of course, I hope I can memorize it.(Clears throat)The violin is made of a wood box and four metal strings. By pulling a string, it vibrates and produces a sound wave, which passes through a piece of wood called a bridge, and goes down to the wood box and gets amplified, but ... let me think.(Laughter)Placing your finger at different places on the fingerboard changes the string length, and that changes the frequency of the sound wave. (Sighs) Oh, my gosh!(Laughter)OK, this is sort of technology, but I can call it a 16th-century technology. But actually, the most fascinating thing that I found was that even the audio system or wave transmission nowadays are still based on the same principle of producing and projecting sound. Isn't that cool?(Laughter)(Applause)Design \u2014 I love its design. I remember when I was little, my mom asked me, \"Would you like to play the violin or the piano?\" I looked at that giant monster and said to myself \u2014 \"I am not going to lock myself on that bench the whole day!\"(Laughter)This is small and lightweight. I can play from standing, sitting or walking. And, you know what? The best of all is that if I don't want to practice, (Whispering) I can hide it.(Laughter)The violin is very beautiful. Some people relate it as the shape of a lady. But whether you like it or not, it's been so for more than 400 years, unlike modern stuff [that] easily looks dated. But I think it's very personal and unique that, although each violin looks pretty similar, no two violins sound the same \u2014 even from the same maker or based on the same model.Entertainment \u2014 I love the entertainment. But actually, the instrument itself isn't very entertaining. I mean, when I first got my violin and tried to play around on it, it was actually really bad, because it didn't sound the way I'd heard from other kids \u2014 it was so horrible and so scratchy. So, it wasn't entertaining at all. But besides, my brother found this very funny: Yuk! Yuk! Yuk!(Laughter)A few years later, I heard a joke about the greatest violinist, Jascha Heifetz. After Mr. Heifetz's concert, a lady came over and complimented him: \"Oh, Mr. Heifetz, your violin sounded so great tonight!\" And Mr. Heifetz was a very cool person, so he picked up his violin and said, \"Funny \u2014 I don't hear anything.\"(Laughter)Now I realize that as the musician, we human beings, with our great mind, artistic heart and skill, can change this 16th-century technology and a legendary design to a wonderful entertainment. Now I know why I'm here.(Music)(Music ends)(Applause)At first, I thought I was just going to be here to perform, but unexpectedly, I learned and enjoyed much more. But ... although some of the talks were quite up there for me.(Laughter)Like the multi-dimension stuff. I mean, honestly, I'd be happy enough if I could actually get my two dimensions correct in school.(Laughter)But actually, the most impressive thing to me is that \u2014 well, actually, I would also like to say this for all children is to say thank you to all adults, for actually caring for us a lot, and to make our future world much better.

Like the speaker before me \u2014 I am a TED virgin, I guess. I'm also the first time here, and ...(Laughter)I don't know what to say!(Applause)I'm really happy that Mr. Anderson invited me. I'm really grateful that I get a chance to play for everyone. And the song that I just played was by Josef Hofmann. It's called \"Kaleidoscope.\" And Hofmann is a Polish pianist and composer of the late 19th century, and he's widely considered one of the greatest pianists of all time.I have another piece that I'd like to play for you. It's called \"Abegg Variations,\" by Robert Schumann, a German 19th-century composer. The name \"Abegg\" is actually A-B-E-G-G, and that's the main theme in the melody. (Plays the notes A, B, E, G and G) That comes from the last name of one of Schumann's female friends.(Laughter)But he wrote that for his wife.(Laughter)So actually, if you listen carefully, there are supposed to be five variations on this Abegg theme. It's written around 1834, so even though it's old, I hope you'll like it.(Music)(Music ends)(Applause)Now comes the part that I hate. Well, because Mr. Anderson told me that this session is called \"Sync and Flow,\" I was wondering, \"What do I know that these geniuses don't?\"(Laughter)So, I'll talk about musical composition, even though I don't know where to start.How do I compose? I think Yamaha does a really good job of teaching us how to compose. What I do first is, I make a lot of little musical ideas you can just improvise here at the piano \u2014 and I choose one of those to become my main theme, my main melody, like the Abegg that you just heard. And once I choose my main theme, I have to decide: Out of all the styles in music, what kind of style do I want? And this year, I composed a Romantic style. So for inspiration, I listened to Liszt and Tchaikovsky and all the great Romantic composers.Next, I make the structure of the entire piece with my teachers. They help me plan out the whole piece. And then the hard part is filling it in with musical ideas, because then you have to think.(Laughter)And then, when the piece takes somewhat of a solified form \u2014 solidified, excuse me \u2014 solidified form, you're supposed to actually polish the piece, polish the details, and then polish the overall performance of the composition.And another thing that I enjoy doing is drawing. Drawing, because I like to draw, you know, Japanese anime art. I think that's a craze among teens right now. And once I realized it, there's a parallel between creating music and creating art, because for your motive, or your little initial idea for your drawing, it's your character \u2014 you want to decide who you want to draw, or if you want to draw an original character. And then you want to decide: How are you going to draw the character? Like, am I going to use one page? Am I going to draw it on the computer? Am I going to use a two-page spread like a comic book? For a more grandiose effect, I guess. And then you have to do the initial sketch of the character, which is like your structure of a piece, and then you add pen and pencil, and whatever details that you need \u2014 that's polishing the drawing.And another thing that both of these have in common is your state of mind, because I know I'm one of those teenagers that are really easily distracted. So if I'm trying to do homework and I don't feel like it, I'll try to draw or, you know, waste my time. And then what happens is, sometimes I absolutely can't draw or I can't compose at all, and then it's like there's too much on your mind. You can't focus on what you're supposed to do. And sometimes, if you manage to use your time wisely and work on it, you'll get something out of it, but it doesn't come naturally.What happens is, if something magical happens, if something natural happens to you, you're able to produce all this beautiful stuff instantly, and then that's what I consider \"flow,\" because that's when everything clicks and you're able to do anything. You feel like you're on top of your game and you can do anything you want.I'm not going to play my own composition today because, although I did finish it, it's way too long. Instead, I'd like to try something called \"improvisation.\" I have here seven note cards, one with each note of the musical alphabet. And I'd like someone to come up here and choose five \u2014 anyone to come up here and choose five \u2014 and then I can make it into some sort of melody, and I'll improvise it. Wow. A volunteer, yay!(Laughter)(Applause)Jennifer Lin: Nice to meet you.Goldie Hawn: Thank you. Choose five?JL: Yes, five cards. Any five cards.GH: OK, one. JL: OK.GH: Two. JL: Yes.GH: Three.GH: Oh, D and F \u2014 too familiar.(Laughter)JL: One more. GH: OK. \"E\" for \"effort.\"JL: Would you mind reading them out in the order that you chose them?GH: OK \u2014 C, G, B, A and E.JL: Thank you very much!GH: You're welcome. And what about these?JL: I won't use them. Thank you!(Applause)Now, she chose C, G, B, A, E. I'm going to try to put that in some sort of order.(Plays notes)OK, that's nice. So, I'm going to have a moment to think, and I'll try to make something out of it.(Plays the five notes)(Music)(Music ends)(Applause)The next song, or the encore that I'm going to play is called

drawing.\n\n00:14:44.870 --> 00:14:48.354\nDrawing, because I like to draw,\nyou know, Japanese anime art.\n\n00:14:48.378 --> 00:14:50.661\nI think that's a craze\namong teens right now.\n\n00:14:51.343 --> 00:14:52.995\nAnd once I realized it,\n\n00:14:53.019 --> 00:14:57.015\nthere's a parallel between creating\nmusic and creating art,\n\n00:14:57.039 --> 00:15:02.149\nbecause for your motive, or your\nlittle initial idea for your drawing,\n\n00:15:02.173 --> 00:15:05.141\nit's your character -- you want\nto decide who you want to draw,\n\n00:15:05.165 --> 00:15:07.321\nor if you want to draw\nan original character.\n\n00:15:07.345 --> 00:15:10.842\nAnd then you want to decide:\nHow are you going to draw the character?\n\n00:15:10.866 --> 00:15:14.278\nLike, am I going to use one page?\nAm I going to draw it on the computer?\n\n00:15:14.302 --> 00:15:17.478\nAm I going to use a two-page spread\nlike a comic book?\n\n00:15:17.502 --> 00:15:19.705\nFor a more grandiose effect, I guess.\n\n00:15:20.089 --> 00:15:23.236\nAnd then you have to do\nthe initial sketch of the character,\n\n00:15:23.260 --> 00:15:25.298\nwhich is like your structure of a piece,\n\n00:15:25.322 --> 00:15:29.082\nand then you add pen and pencil,\nand whatever details that you need --\n\n00:15:29.106 --> 00:15:30.602\nthat's polishing the drawing.\n\n00:15:30.983 --> 00:15:34.705\nAnd another thing that both of these\nhave in common is your state of mind,\n\n00:15:34.729 --> 00:15:39.715\nbecause I know I'm one of those teenagers\nthat are really easily distracted.\n\n00:15:39.739 --> 00:15:44.754\nSo if I'm trying to do homework\nand I don't feel like it,\n\n00:15:44.778 --> 00:15:47.531\nI'll try to draw or,\nyou know, waste my time.\n\n00:15:47.957 --> 00:15:50.735\nAnd then what happens is,\nsometimes I absolutely can't draw\n\n00:15:50.759 --> 00:15:52.720\nor I can't compose at all,\n\n00:15:52.744 --> 00:15:55.050\nand then it's like\nthere's too much on your mind.\n\n00:15:55.074 --> 00:15:57.451\nYou can't focus\non what you're supposed to do.\n\n00:15:57.475 --> 00:16:02.776\nAnd sometimes, if you manage to use\nyour time wisely and work on it,\n\n00:16:02.800 --> 00:16:05.889\nyou'll get something out of it,\nbut it doesn't come naturally.\n\n00:16:06.444 --> 00:16:08.928\nWhat happens is,\nif something magical happens,\n\n00:16:08.952 --> 00:16:11.556\nif something natural happens to you,\n\n00:16:11.580 --> 00:16:15.199\nyou're able to produce\nall this beautiful stuff instantly,\n\n00:16:15.223 --> 00:16:17.351\nand then that's what I consider \"flow,\"\n\n00:16:17.375 --> 00:16:21.343\nbecause that's when everything clicks\nand you're able to do anything.\n\n00:16:21.367 --> 00:16:25.128\nYou feel like you're on top of your game\nand you can do anything you want.\n\n00:16:25.152 --> 00:16:28.373\nI'm not going to play\nmy own composition today because,\n\n00:16:28.397 --> 00:16:30.958\nalthough I did finish it,\nit's way too long.\n\n00:16:32.008 --> 00:16:35.196\nInstead, I'd like to try something\ncalled \"improvisation.\"\n\n00:16:35.220 --> 00:16:37.441\nI have here seven note cards,\n\n00:16:37.465 --> 00:16:40.648\none with each note\nof the musical alphabet.\n\n00:16:40.672 --> 00:16:44.555\nAnd I'd like someone to come up here\nand choose five --\n\n00:16:44.579 --> 00:16:46.567\nanyone to come up here and choose five --\n\n00:16:46.591 --> 00:16:49.303\nand then I can make it\ninto some sort of melody,\n\n00:16:49.327 --> 00:16:50.707\nand I'll improvise it.\n\n00:16:51.669 --> 00:16:54.800\nWow.

I think it's one of the most exciting that I'm working on, but I think it's also the simplest.It's a project that has the potential to make a huge impact around the world. It addresses one of the biggest health issues on the planet, the number one cause of death in children under five. Which is ...? Water-borne diseases? Diarrhea? Malnutrition? No. It's breathing the smoke from indoor cooking fires \u2014 acute respiratory infections caused by this. Can you believe that?I find this shocking and somewhat appalling. Can't we make cleaner burning cooking fuels? Can't we make better stoves? How is it that this can lead to over two million deaths every year? I know Bill Joy was talking to you about the wonders of carbon nanotubes, so I'm going to talk to you about the wonders of carbon macro-tubes, which is charcoal.(Laughter)So this is a picture of rural Haiti. Haiti is now 98 percent deforested. You'll see scenes like this all over the island. It leads to all sorts of environmental problems and problems that affect people throughout the nation. A couple years ago there was severe flooding that led to thousands of deaths \u2014 that's directly attributable to the fact that there are no trees on the hills to stabilize the soil. So the rains come \u2014 they go down the rivers and the flooding happens.Now one of the reasons why there are so few trees is this: people need to cook, and they harvest wood and they make charcoal in order to do it. It's not that people are ignorant to the environmental damage. They know perfectly well, but they have no other choice. Fossil fuels are not available, and solar energy doesn't cook the way that they like their food prepared. And so this is what they do. You'll find families like this who go out into the forest to find a tree, cut it down and make charcoal out of it. So not surprisingly, there's a lot of effort that's been done to look at alternative cooking fuels.About four years ago, I took a team of students down to Haiti and we worked with Peace Corps volunteers there. This is one such volunteer and this is a device that he had built in the village where he worked. And the idea was that you could take waste paper; you could compress it and make briquettes that could be used for fuel. But this device was very slow. So our engineering students went to work on it and with some very simple changes, they were able to triple the throughput of this device. So you could imagine they were very excited about it. And they took the briquettes back to MIT so that they could test them. And one of the things that they found was they didn't burn. So it was a little discouraging to the students.(Laughter)And in fact, if you look closely, right here you can see it says, \"US Peace Corps.\" As it turns out, there actually wasn't any waste paper in this village. And while it was a good use of government paperwork for this volunteer to bring it back with him to his village, it was 800 kilometers away. And so we thought perhaps there might be a better way to come up with an alternative cooking fuel.What we wanted to do is we wanted to make a fuel that used something that was readily available on the local level. You see these all over Haiti as well. They're small-scale sugar mills. And the waste product from them after you extract the juice from the sugarcane is called \"bagasse.\" It has no other use. It has no nutritional value, so they don't feed it to the animals. It just sits in a pile near the sugar mill until eventually they burn it. What we wanted to do was we wanted to find a way to harness this waste resource and turn it into a fuel that would be something that people could easily cook with, something like charcoal. So over the next couple of years, students and I worked to develop a process.So you start with the bagasse, and then you take a very simple kiln that you can make out of a waste fifty five-gallon oil drum. After some time, after setting it on fire, you seal it to restrict the oxygen that goes into the kiln, and then you end up with this carbonized material here. However, you can't burn this. It's too fine and it burns too quickly to be useful for cooking. So we had to try to find a way to form it into useful briquettes. And conveniently, one of my students was from Ghana, and he remembered a dish his mom used to make for him called \"kokonte,\" which is a very sticky porridge made out of the cassava root. And so what we did was we looked, and we found that cassava is indeed grown in Haiti, under the name of \"manioc.\" In fact, it's grown all over the world \u2014 yucca, tapioca, manioc, cassava, it's all the same thing \u2014 a very starchy root vegetable. And you can make a very thick, sticky porridge out of it, which you can use to bind together the charcoal briquettes. So we did this. We went down to Haiti. These are the graduates of the first Ecole de Charbon, or Charcoal Institute. And these \u2014(Laughter)That's right. So I'm actually an instructor at MIT as well as CIT. And these are the briquettes that we made.Now I'm going to take you to a different continent. This is India and this is the most commonly used cooking fuel in India. It's cow dung. And more than in Haiti, this produces really smoky fires, and this is where you see the health impacts of cooking with cow dung and biomass as a fuel. Kids and women are especially affected by it, because they're the ones who are around the cooking fires.So we wanted to see if we could introduce this charcoal-making technology there. Well, unfortunately, they didn't have sugarcane and they didn't have cassava, but that didn't stop us. What we did was we found what were the locally available sources of biomass. And there was wheat straw and there was rice straw in this area. And what we could use as a binder was actually small amounts of cow manure, which they used ordinarily for their fuel. And we did side-by-side tests, and here you can see the charcoal briquettes and here the cow dung. And you can see that it's a lot cleaner burning of a cooking fuel. And in fact, it heats the water a lot more quickly. And so we were very happy, thus far. But one of the things that we found was when we did side-by-side comparisons with wood charcoal, it didn't burn as long. And the briquettes crumbled a little bit and we lost energy as they fell apart as they were cooking. So we wanted to try to find a way to make a stronger briquette so that we could compete with wood charcoal in the markets in Haiti.So we went back to MIT, we took out the Instron machine and we figured out what sort of forces you needed in order to compress a briquette to the level that you actually are getting improved performance out of it? And at the same time that we had students in the lab looking at this, we also had community partners in Haiti working to develop the process, to improve it and make it more accessible to people in the villages there. And after some time, we developed a low-cost press that allows you to produce charcoal, which actually now burns not only \u2014 actually, it burns longer, cleaner than wood charcoal.So now we're in a situation where we have a product, which is actually better than what you can buy in Haiti in the marketplace, which is a very wonderful place to be. In Haiti alone, about 30 million trees are cut down every year. There's a possibility of this being implemented and saving a good portion of those. In addition, the revenue generated from that charcoal is 260 million dollars. That's an awful lot for a country like Haiti \u2014 with a population of eight million and an average income of less than 400 dollars. So this is where we're also moving ahead with our charcoal project.And one of the things that I think is also interesting, is I have a friend up at UC Berkeley who's been doing risk analysis. And he's looked at the problem of the health impacts of burning wood versus charcoal. And he's found that worldwide, you could prevent a million deaths switching from wood to charcoal as a cooking fuel. That's remarkable, but up until now, there weren't ways to do it without cutting down trees. But now we have a way that's using an agricultural waste material to create a cooking fuel.One of the really exciting things, though, is something that came out of the trip that I took to Ghana just last month. And I think it's the coolest thing, and it's even lower tech than what you just saw, if you can imagine such a thing. Here it is. So what is this? This is corncobs turned into charcoal. And the beauty of this is that you don't need to form briquettes \u2014 it comes ready made. This is my $100 laptop, right here. And actually, like Nick, I brought samples.(Laughter)So we can pass these around. They're fully functional, field-tested, ready to roll out.(Laughter)And I think one of the things which is also remarkable about this technology, is that the technology transfer is so easy. Compared to the sugarcane charcoal, where we have to teach people how to form it into briquettes and you have the extra step of cooking the binder, this comes pre-briquetted. And this is about the most exciting thing in my life right now, which is perhaps a sad commentary on my life.(Laughter)But once you see it, like you guys in the front row \u2014 All right, yeah, OK. So anyway \u2014(Laughter)Here it is. And this is, I think, a perfect example of what Robert Wright was talking about in those non-zero-sum things. So not only do you have health benefits, you have environmental benefits. But this is one of the incredibly rare situations where you also have economic benefits. People can make their own cooking fuel from waste products. They can generate income from this. They can save the money that they were going to spend on charcoal and they can produce excess and sell it in the market to people who aren't making their own. It's really rare that you don't have trade-offs between health and economics, or environment and economics. So this is a project that I just find extremely exciting and I'm really looking forward to see where it takes us.So when we talk about, now, the future we will create, one of the things that I think is necessary is to have a very clear vision of the world that we live in. And now, I don't actually mean the world that we live in. I mean the world where women spend two to three hours everyday grinding grain for their families to eat. I mean the world where advanced building materials means cement roofing tiles that are made by hand, and where, when you work 10 hours a day, you're still only earning 60 dollars in a month. I mean the world where women and children spend 40 billion hours a year fetching water. That's as if the entire workforce of the state of California worked full time for a year doing nothing but fetching water.It's a place where, for example, if this were India, in this room, only three of us would have a car. If this were Afghanistan, only one person in this room would know how the use the Internet. If this were Zambia \u2014 300 of you would be farmers, 100 of you would have AIDS or HIV. And more than half of you would be living on less than a dollar a day. These are the issues that we need to come up with solutions for. These are the issues that we need to be training our engineers, our designers, our business people, our entrepreneurs to be facing. These are the solutions that we need to find.I have a few areas that I believe are especially important that we address. One of them is creating technologies to promote micro-finance and micro-enterprise, so that people who are living below the poverty line can find a way to move out \u2014 and that they're not doing it using the same traditional basket making, poultry rearing, etc. But there are new technologies and new products that they can make on a small scale.The next thing I believe is that we need to create technologies for poor farmers to add value to their own crops. And we need to rethink our development strategies, so that we're not promoting educational campaigns to get them to stop being farmers, but rather to stop being poor farmers. And we need to think about how we can do that effectively. We need to work with the people in these communities and give them the resources and the tools that they need to solve their own problems. That's the best way to do it. We shouldn't be doing it from outside. So we need to create this future, and we need to start doing it now.Thank you.(Applause)Chris Anderson: Thank you, incredible. Stay here. Tell us \u2014 just while we see if someone has a question \u2014 just tell us about one of the other things that you've worked on.Amy Smith: Some of the other things we're working on are ways to do low-cost water quality testing, so that communities can maintain their own water systems, know when they're working, know when they treat them, etc. We're also looking at low-cost water-treatment systems. One of the really exciting things is looking at solar water disinfection and improving the ability to be able to do that.CA: What's the bottleneck preventing this stuff getting from scale? Do you need to find entrepreneurs, or venture capitalists, or what do you need to take what you've got and get it to scale?AS: I think it's large numbers of people moving it forward. It's a difficult thing \u2014 it's a marketplace which is very fragmented and a consumer population with no income. So you can't use the same models that you use in the United States for making things move forward. And we're a pretty small staff, which is me.(Laughter)So, you know, I do what I can with the students. We have 30 students a year go out into the field and try to implement this and move it forward. The other thing is you have to do things with a long time frame, as, you know, you can't expect to get something done in a year or two years; you have to be looking five or 10 years ahead. But I think with the vision to do that, we can move forward.", "id": 2, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:12.598 --> 00:00:13.813\nIn terms of invention,\n\n00:00:13.838 --> 00:00:16.696\nI'd like to tell you the tale\nof one of my favorite projects.\n\n00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:20.013\nI think it's one of the most exciting\nthat I'm working on,\n\n00:00:20.038 --> 00:00:21.758\nbut I think it's also the simplest.\n\n00:00:22.118 --> 00:00:26.574\nIt's a project that has the potential\nto make a huge impact around the world.\n\n00:00:26.598 --> 00:00:30.014\nIt addresses one of the biggest\nhealth issues on the planet,\n\n00:00:30.038 --> 00:00:33.050\nthe number one cause of death\nin children under five.\n\n00:00:33.598 --> 00:00:34.798\nWhich is ...?\n\n00:00:35.638 --> 00:00:38.718\nWater-borne diseases?\nDiarrhea?

00:01:37.574\nthat there are no trees on the hills\nto stabilize the soil.\n\n00:01:37.598 --> 00:01:38.854\nSo the rains come --\n\n00:01:38.878 --> 00:01:41.318\nthey go down the rivers\nand the flooding happens.\n\n00:01:42.398 --> 00:01:45.854\nNow one of the reasons\nwhy there are so few trees is this:\n\n00:01:45.878 --> 00:01:47.254\npeople need to cook,\n\n00:01:47.278 --> 00:01:51.374\nand they harvest wood\nand they make charcoal in order to do it.\n\n00:01:51.398 --> 00:01:54.303\nIt's not that people are ignorant\nto the environmental damage.\n\n00:01:54.327 --> 00:01:56.947\nThey know perfectly well,\nbut they have no other choice.\n\n00:01:56.971 --> 00:01:58.974\nFossil fuels are not available,\n\n00:01:58.998 --> 00:02:03.894\nand solar energy doesn't cook the way\nthat they like their food prepared.\n\n00:02:03.918 --> 00:02:06.054\nAnd so this is what they do.\n\n00:02:06.078 --> 00:02:10.254\nYou'll find families like this who go out\ninto the forest to find a tree,\n\n00:02:10.278 --> 00:02:13.158\ncut it down and make charcoal out of it.\n\n00:02:14.398 --> 00:02:15.614\nSo not surprisingly,\n\n00:02:15.638 --> 00:02:20.437\nthere's a lot of effort that's been done\nto look at alternative cooking fuels.\n\n00:02:21.318 --> 00:02:24.374\nAbout four years ago, I took\na team of students down to Haiti\n\n00:02:24.398 --> 00:02:26.814\nand we worked with\nPeace Corps volunteers there.\n\n00:02:26.838 --> 00:02:28.254\nThis is one such volunteer\n\n00:02:28.278 --> 00:02:31.894\nand this is a device that he had built\nin the village where he worked.\n\n00:02:31.918 --> 00:02:34.574\nAnd the idea was\nthat you could take waste paper;\n\n00:02:34.598 --> 00:02:35.814\nyou could compress it\n\n00:02:35.838 --> 00:02:38.494\nand make briquettes\nthat could be used for fuel.\n\n00:02:38.518 --> 00:02:40.534\nBut this device was very slow.\n\n00:02:40.558 --> 00:02:43.654\nSo our engineering students\nwent to work on it\n\n00:02:43.678 --> 00:02:45.774\nand with some very simple changes,\n\n00:02:45.798 --> 00:02:48.854\nthey were able to triple\nthe throughput of this device.\n\n00:02:48.878 --> 00:02:51.414\nSo you could imagine\nthey were very excited about it.\n\n00:02:51.438 --> 00:02:55.238\nAnd they took the briquettes back to MIT\nso that they could test them.\n\n00:02:55.958 --> 00:03:00.214\nAnd one of the things\nthat they found was they didn't burn.\n\n00:03:00.238 --> 00:03:03.014\nSo it was a little\ndiscouraging to the students.\n\n00:03:03.038 --> 00:03:04.574\n(Laughter)\n\n00:03:04.598 --> 00:03:06.974\nAnd in fact, if you look closely,\n\n00:03:06.998 --> 00:03:09.598\nright here you can see\nit says, \"US Peace Corps.\"\n\n00:03:10.598 --> 00:03:14.414\nAs it turns out, there actually wasn't\nany waste paper in this village.\n\n00:03:14.438 --> 00:03:17.654\nAnd while it was a good use\nof government paperwork\n\n00:03:17.678 --> 00:03:20.583\nfor this volunteer to bring it\nback with him to his village,\n\n00:03:20.607 --> 00:03:22.694\nit was 800 kilometers away.\n\n00:03:22.718 --> 00:03:25.614\nAnd so we thought perhaps\nthere might be a better way\n\n00:03:25.638 --> 00:03:27.838\nto come up with\nan alternative cooking fuel.\n\n00:03:28.598 --> 00:03:30.854\nWhat we wanted to do\nis we wanted to make a fuel\n\n00:03:30.878 --> 00:03:34.214\nthat used something that was\nreadily available on the local level.\n\n00:03:34.238 --> 00:03:36.014\nYou see these all over Haiti as well.\n\n00:03:36.038 --> 00:03:37.774\nThey're small-scale sugar mills.\n\n00:03:37.798 --> 00:03:39.294\nAnd the waste product from them\n\n00:03:39.318 --> 00:03:41.734\nafter you extract the juice\nfrom the sugarcane\n\n00:03:41.758 --> 00:03:43.294\nis called \"bagasse.\"\n\n00:03:43.318 --> 00:03:44.534\nIt has no other use.\n\n00:03:44.558 --> 00:03:47.854\nIt has no nutritional value,\nso they don't feed it to the animals.\n\n00:03:47.878 --> 00:03:51.918\nIt just sits in a pile near the sugar mill\nuntil eventually they burn it.\n\n00:03:52.998 --> 00:03:55.294\nWhat we wanted to do was\nwe wanted to find a way\n\n00:03:55.318 --> 00:03:58.294\nto harness this waste resource\nand turn it into a fuel\n\n00:03:58.318 --> 00:04:01.294\nthat would be something\nthat people could easily cook with,\n\n00:04:01.318 --> 00:04:02.558\nsomething like charcoal.\n\n00:04:03.558 --> 00:04:05.174\nSo over the next couple of years,\n\n00:04:05.198 --> 00:04:08.854\nstudents and I worked\nto develop a process.\n\n00:04:08.878 --> 00:04:12.694\nSo you start with the bagasse,\nand then you take a very simple kiln\n\n00:04:12.718 --> 00:04:15.894\nthat you can make out of\na waste fifty five-gallon oil drum.\n\n00:04:15.918 --> 00:04:18.214\nAfter some time, after setting it on fire,\n\n00:04:18.238 --> 00:04:22.214\nyou seal it to restrict the oxygen\nthat goes into the kiln,\n\n00:04:22.238 --> 00:04:25.238\nand then you end up\nwith this carbonized material here.\n\n00:04:26.038 --> 00:04:27.614\nHowever, you can't burn this.\n\n00:04:27.638 --> 00:04:32.333\nIt's too fine and it burns too quickly\nto be useful for cooking.\n\n00:04:32.357 --> 00:04:36.614\nSo we had to try to find a way\nto form it into useful briquettes.\n\n00:04:36.638 --> 00:04:40.054\nAnd conveniently,\none of my students was from Ghana,\n\n00:04:40.078 --> 00:04:43.412\nand he remembered a dish his mom\nused to make for him called \"kokonte,\"\n\n00:04:43.436 --> 00:04:46.894\nwhich is a very sticky porridge\nmade out of the cassava root.\n\n00:04:46.918 --> 00:04:48.494\nAnd so what we did was we looked,\n\n00:04:48.518 --> 00:04:51.614\nand we found that cassava\nis indeed grown in Haiti,\n\n00:04:51.638 --> 00:04:53.774\nunder the name of \"manioc.\"\n\n00:04:53.798 --> 00:04:55.751\nIn fact, it's grown all over the world --\n\n00:04:55.775 --> 00:04:58.854\nyucca, tapioca, manioc, cassava,\nit's all the same thing --\n\n00:04:58.878 --> 00:05:00.974\na very starchy root vegetable.\n\n00:05:00.998 --> 00:05:04.214\nAnd you can make a very thick,\nsticky porridge out of it,\n\n00:05:04.238 --> 00:05:08.374\nwhich you can use to bind together\nthe charcoal briquettes.\n\n00:05:08.398 --> 00:05:11.574\nSo we did this. We went down to Haiti.\n\n00:05:11.598 --> 00:05:14.254\nThese are the graduates\nof the first Ecole de Charbon,\n\n00:05:14.278 --> 00:05:15.974\nor Charcoal Institute.\n\n00:05:15.998 --> 00:05:17.214\nAnd these --\n\n00:05:17.238 --> 00:05:18.454\n(Laughter)\n\n00:05:18.478 --> 00:05:24.454\nThat's right. So I'm actually\nan instructor at MIT as well as CIT.\n\n00:05:24.478 --> 00:05:26.558\nAnd these are the briquettes that we made.\n\n00:05:27.998 --> 00:05:30.398\nNow I'm going to take you\nto a different continent.\n\n00:05:31.278 --> 00:05:32.494\nThis is India\n\n00:05:32.518 --> 00:05:35.734\nand this is the most commonly used\ncooking fuel in India.\n\n00:05:35.758 --> 00:05:37.134\nIt's cow dung.\n\n00:05:37.158 --> 00:05:41.334\nAnd more than in Haiti,\nthis produces really smoky fires,\n\n00:05:41.358 --> 00:05:43.814\nand this is where you see\nthe health impacts\n\n00:05:43.838 --> 00:05:47.918\nof cooking with cow dung\nand biomass as a fuel.\n\n00:05:48.558 --> 00:05:50.774\nKids and women\nare especially affected by it,\n\n00:05:50.798 --> 00:05:53.934\nbecause they're the ones\nwho are around the cooking fires.\n\n00:05:53.958 --> 00:05:55.174\nSo we wanted to see\n\n00:05:55.198 --> 00:05:58.694\nif we could introduce\nthis charcoal-making technology there.\n\n00:05:58.718 --> 00:06:01.134\nWell, unfortunately,\nthey didn't have sugarcane\n\n00:06:01.158 --> 00:06:02.539\nand they didn't have cassava,\n\n00:06:02.563 --> 00:06:03.763\nbut that didn't stop us.\n\n00:06:04.358 --> 00:06:08.174\nWhat we did was we found what were\nthe locally available sources of biomass.\n\n00:06:08.198 --> 00:06:11.574\nAnd there was wheat straw\nand there was rice straw in this area.\n\n00:06:11.598 --> 00:06:15.214\nAnd what we could use as a binder\nwas actually small amounts of cow manure,\n\n00:06:15.238 --> 00:06:17.478\nwhich they used ordinarily for their fuel.\n\n00:06:18.918 --> 00:06:21.094\nAnd we did side-by-side tests,\n\n00:06:21.118 --> 00:06:23.694\nand here you can see\nthe charcoal briquettes\n\n00:06:23.718 --> 00:06:24.934\nand here the cow dung.\n\n00:06:24.958 --> 00:06:28.214\nAnd you can see that it's a lot cleaner\nburning of a cooking fuel.\n\n00:06:28.238 --> 00:06:30.814\nAnd in fact, it heats the water\na lot more quickly.\n\n00:06:30.838 --> 00:06:33.134\nAnd so we were very happy, thus far.\n\n00:06:33.158 --> 00:06:34.854\nBut one of the things that we found\n\n00:06:34.878 --> 00:06:37.694\nwas when we did side-by-side\ncomparisons with wood charcoal,\n\n00:06:37.718 --> 00:06:39.334\nit didn't burn as long.\n\n00:06:39.358 --> 00:06:41.263\nAnd the briquettes crumbled a little bit\n\n00:06:41.287 --> 00:06:44.454\nand we lost energy as they fell apart\nas they were cooking.\n\n00:06:44.478 --> 00:06:47.694\nSo we wanted to try to find a way\nto make a stronger briquette\n\n00:06:47.718 --> 00:06:51.318\nso that we could compete with\nwood charcoal in the markets in Haiti.\n\n00:06:52.278 --> 00:06:54.294\nSo we went back to MIT,\n\n00:06:54.318 --> 00:06:56.534\nwe took out the Instron machine\n\n00:06:56.558 --> 00:06:59.254\nand we figured out\nwhat sort of forces you needed\n\n00:06:59.278 --> 00:07:01.374\nin order to compress\na briquette to the level\n\n00:07:01.398 --> 00:07:04.256\nthat you actually are getting\nimproved performance out of it?\n\n00:07:04.918 --> 00:07:08.214\nAnd at the same time that we had\nstudents in the lab looking at this,\n\n00:07:08.238 --> 00:07:15.174\nwe also had community partners in Haiti\nworking to develop the process,\n\n00:07:15.198 --> 00:07:20.198\nto improve it and make it more accessible\nto people in the villages there.\n\n00:07:21.118 --> 00:07:22.334\nAnd after some time,\n\n00:07:22.358 --> 00:07:27.174\nwe developed a low-cost press\nthat allows you to produce charcoal,\n\n00:07:27.198 --> 00:07:29.878\nwhich actually now burns not only --\n\n00:07:30.600 --> 00:07:33.918\nactually, it burns longer,\ncleaner than wood charcoal.\n\n00:07:34.358 --> 00:07:36.894\nSo now we're in a situation\nwhere we have a product,\n\n00:07:36.918 --> 00:07:41.214\nwhich is actually better than what\nyou can buy in Haiti in the marketplace,\n\n00:07:41.238 --> 00:07:43.958\nwhich is a very wonderful place to be.\n\n00:07:45.918 --> 00:07:50.654\nIn Haiti alone, about 30 million trees\nare cut down every year.\n\n00:07:50.678 --> 00:07:53.174\nThere's a possibility\nof this being implemented\n\n00:07:53.198 --> 00:07:55.494\nand saving a good portion of those.\n\n00:07:55.518 --> 00:08:01.934\nIn addition, the revenue generated\nfrom that charcoal is 260 million dollars.\n\n00:08:01.958 --> 00:08:04.494\nThat's an awful lot\nfor a country like Haiti --\n\n00:08:04.518 --> 00:08:06.374\nwith a population of eight million\n\n00:08:06.398 --> 00:08:09.598\nand an average income\nof less than 400 dollars.\n\n00:08:10.638 --> 00:08:14.494\nSo this is where we're also moving ahead\nwith our charcoal project.\n\n00:08:14.518 --> 00:08:17.174\nAnd one of the things\nthat I think is also interesting,\n\n00:08:17.198 --> 00:08:21.494\nis I have a friend up at UC Berkeley\nwho's been doing risk analysis.\n\n00:08:21.518 --> 00:08:24.574\nAnd he's looked at the problem\nof the health impacts\n\n00:08:24.598 --> 00:08:26.694\nof burning wood versus charcoal.\n\n00:08:26.718 --> 00:08:30.814\nAnd he's found that worldwide,\nyou could prevent a million deaths\n\n00:08:30.838 --> 00:08:33.814\nswitching from wood\nto charcoal as a cooking fuel.\n\n00:08:33.838 --> 00:08:35.054\nThat's remarkable,\n\n00:08:35.078 --> 00:08:38.534\nbut up until now, there weren't ways\nto do it without cutting down trees.\n\n00:08:38.558 --> 00:08:39.774\nBut now we have a way\n\n00:08:39.798 --> 00:08:43.478\nthat's using an agricultural\nwaste material to create a cooking fuel.\n\n00:08:43.918 --> 00:08:45.934\nOne of the really exciting things, though,\n\n00:08:45.958 --> 00:08:49.530\nis something that came out of the trip\nthat I took to Ghana just last month.\n\n00:08:49.554 --> 00:08:52.973\nAnd I think it's the coolest thing,\n\n00:08:52.997 --> 00:08:55.237\nand it's even lower tech\nthan what you just saw,\n\n00:08:55.261 --> 00:08:57.294\nif you can imagine such a thing.\n\n00:08:57.318 --> 00:08:58.534\nHere it is.\n\n00:08:58.558 --> 00:08:59.758\nSo what is this?\n\n00:09:00.438 --> 00:09:03.014\nThis is corncobs turned into charcoal.\n\n00:09:03.038 --> 00:09:06.181\nAnd the beauty of this is\nthat you don't need to form briquettes --\n\n00:09:06.205 --> 00:09:07.534\nit comes ready made.\n\n00:09:07.558 --> 00:09:10.414\nThis is my $100 laptop, right here.\n\n00:09:10.438 --> 00:09:13.454\nAnd actually, like Nick,\nI brought samples.\n\n00:09:13.478 --> 00:09:15.694\n(Laughter)\n\n00:09:15.718 --> 00:09:17.478\nSo we can pass these around.\n\n00:09:19.478 --> 00:09:23.562\nThey're fully functional,\nfield-tested, ready to roll out.\n\n00:09:23.586 --> 00:09:25.292\n(Laughter)\n\n00:09:27.478 --> 00:09:28.974\nAnd I think one of the things\n\n00:09:28.998 --> 00:09:33.214\nwhich is also remarkable\nabout this technology,\n\n00:09:33.238 --> 00:09:36.014\nis that the technology\ntransfer is so easy.\n\n00:09:36.038 --> 00:09:38.174\nCompared to the sugarcane charcoal,\n\n00:09:38.198 --> 00:09:41.014\nwhere we have to teach people\nhow to form it into briquettes\n\n00:09:41.038 --> 00:09:43.454\nand you have the extra step\nof cooking the binder,\n\n00:09:43.478 --> 00:09:45.054\nthis comes pre-briquetted.\n\n00:09:45.078 --> 00:09:48.031\nAnd this is about the most exciting\nthing in my life right now,\n\n00:09:48.055 --> 00:09:51.254\nwhich is perhaps\na sad commentary on my life.\n\n00:09:51.278 --> 00:09:53.534\n(Laughter)\n\n00:09:53.558 --> 00:09:56.094\nBut once you see it,\nlike you guys in the front row --\n\n00:09:56.118 --> 00:09:57.334\nAll right, yeah, OK.\n\n00:09:57.358 --> 00:09:58.574\nSo anyway --\n\n00:09:58.598 --> 00:10:00.614\n(Laughter)\n\n00:10:00.638 --> 00:10:01.854\nHere it is.\n\n00:10:01.878 --> 00:10:04.334\nAnd this is, I think, a perfect example\n\n00:10:04.358 --> 00:10:09.574\nof what Robert Wright was talking about\nin those non-zero-sum things.\n\n00:10:09.598 --> 00:10:12.094\nSo not only do you have health benefits,\n\n00:10:12.118 --> 00:10:14.254\nyou have environmental benefits.\n\n00:10:14.278 --> 00:10:18.094\nBut this is one\nof the incredibly rare situations\n\n00:10:18.118 --> 00:10:20.454\nwhere you also have economic benefits.\n\n00:10:20.478 --> 00:10:23.534\nPeople can make their own cooking fuel\nfrom waste products.\n\n00:10:23.558 --> 00:10:25.574\nThey can generate income from this.\n\n00:10:25.598 --> 00:10:28.734\nThey can save the money\nthat they were going to spend on charcoal\n\n00:10:28.758 --> 00:10:31.235\nand they can produce excess\nand sell it in the market\n\n00:10:31.259 --> 00:10:33.214\nto people who aren't making their own.\n\n00:10:33.238 --> 00:10:35.534\nIt's really rare\nthat you don't have trade-offs\n\n00:10:35.558 --> 00:10:38.774\nbetween health and economics,\nor environment and economics.\n\n00:10:38.798 --> 00:10:42.534\nSo this is a project\nthat I just find extremely exciting\n\n00:10:42.558 --> 00:10:47.958\nand I'm really looking forward\nto see where it takes us.\n\n00:10:50.078 --> 00:10:53.574\nSo when we talk about, now,\nthe future we will create,\n\n00:10:53.598 --> 00:10:55.614\none of the things\nthat I think is necessary\n\n00:10:55.638 --> 00:10:59.598\nis to have a very clear vision\nof the world that we live in.\n\n00:11:00.118 --> 00:11:02.904\nAnd now, I don't actually mean\nthe world that we live in.\n\n00:11:03.878 --> 00:11:07.974\nI mean the world where women\nspend two to three hours everyday\n\n00:11:07.998 --> 00:11:10.438\ngrinding grain for their families to eat.\n\n00:11:11.918 --> 00:11:14.294\nI mean the world\nwhere advanced building materials\n\n00:11:14.318 --> 00:11:17.734\nmeans cement roofing tiles\nthat are made by hand,\n\n00:11:17.758 --> 00:11:19.894\nand where, when you work 10 hours a day,\n\n00:11:19.918 --> 00:11:22.758\nyou're still only earning\n60 dollars in a month.\n\n00:11:24.278 --> 00:11:25.494\nI mean the world\n\n00:11:25.518 --> 00:11:31.718\nwhere women and children spend\n40 billion hours a year fetching water.\n\n00:11:32.478 --> 00:11:36.214\nThat's as if the entire workforce\nof the state of California\n\n00:11:36.238 --> 00:11:40.734\nworked full time for a year\ndoing nothing but fetching water.\n\n00:11:40.758 --> 00:11:45.094\nIt's a place where,\nfor example, if this were India,\n\n00:11:45.118 --> 00:11:47.558\nin this room, only three of us\nwould have a car.\n\n00:11:48.318 --> 00:11:49.534\nIf this were Afghanistan,\n\n00:11:49.558 --> 00:11:53.174\nonly one person in this room\nwould know how the use the Internet.\n\n00:11:53.198 --> 00:11:54.398\nIf this were Zambia --\n\n00:11:55.478 --> 00:11:58.174\n300 of you would be farmers,\n\n00:11:58.198 --> 00:12:01.334\n100 of you would have AIDS or HIV.\n\n00:12:01.358 --> 00:12:05.198\nAnd more than half of you would be living\non less than a dollar a day.\n\n00:12:06.238 --> 00:12:10.974\nThese are the issues that we\nneed to come up with solutions for.\n\n00:12:10.998 --> 00:12:14.854\nThese are the issues that\nwe need to be training our engineers,\n\n00:12:14.878 --> 00:12:18.318\nour designers, our business people,\nour entrepreneurs to be facing.\n\n00:12:19.238 --> 00:12:21.934\nThese are the solutions\nthat we need to find.\n\n00:12:21.958 --> 00:12:28.134\nI have a few areas that I believe\nare especially important that we address.\n\n00:12:28.158 --> 00:12:30.214\nOne of them is creating technologies\n\n00:12:30.238 --> 00:12:33.254\nto promote micro-finance\nand micro-enterprise,\n\n00:12:33.278 --> 00:12:36.134\nso that people who are living\nbelow the poverty line\n\n00:12:36.158 --> 00:12:37.694\ncan find a way to move out --\n\n00:12:37.718 --> 00:12:39.099\nand that they're not doing it\n\n00:12:39.123 --> 00:12:42.734\nusing the same traditional\nbasket making, poultry rearing, etc.\n\n00:12:42.758 --> 00:12:44.949\nBut there are new technologies\nand new products\n\n00:12:44.973 --> 00:12:47.213\nthat they can make on a small scale.\n\n00:12:47.758 --> 00:12:48.974\nThe next thing I believe\n\n00:12:48.998 --> 00:12:53.374\nis that we need to create\ntechnologies for poor farmers\n\n00:12:53.398 --> 00:12:55.638\nto add value to their own crops.\n\n00:12:56.558 --> 00:12:59.214\nAnd we need to rethink\nour development strategies,\n\n00:12:59.238 --> 00:13:02.494\nso that we're not promoting\neducational campaigns\n\n00:13:02.518 --> 00:13:04.894\nto get them to stop being farmers,\n\n00:13:04.918 --> 00:13:07.694\nbut rather to stop being poor farmers.\n\n00:13:07.718 --> 00:13:10.551\nAnd we need to think\nabout how we can do that effectively.\n\n00:13:11.518 --> 00:13:14.174\nWe need to work with the people\nin these communities\n\n00:13:14.198 --> 00:13:17.054\nand give them the resources\nand the tools that they need\n\n00:13:17.078 --> 00:13:18.774\nto solve their own problems.\n\n00:13:18.798 --> 00:13:20.179\nThat's the best way to do it.\n\n00:13:20.203 --> 00:13:22.494\nWe shouldn't be doing it from outside.\n\n00:13:22.518 --> 00:13:26.678\nSo we need to create this future,\nand we need to start doing it now.\n\n00:13:27.198 --> 00:13:28.414\nThank you.\n\n00:13:28.438 --> 00:13:33.694\n(Applause)\n\n00:13:33.718 --> 00:13:36.210\nChris Anderson: Thank you, incredible.\n\n00:13:36.278 --> 00:13:37.478\nStay here.\n\n00:13:38.318 --> 00:13:41.214\nTell us -- just while we see\nif someone has a question --\n\n00:13:41.238 --> 00:13:44.654\njust tell us about one of the other things\nthat you've worked on.\n\n00:13:44.678 --> 00:13:47.174\nAmy Smith: Some of the other\nthings we're working on\n\n00:13:47.198 --> 00:13:49.375\nare ways to do low-cost\nwater quality testing,\n\n00:13:49.399 --> 00:13:52.134\nso that communities can maintain\ntheir own water systems,\n\n00:13:52.158 --> 00:13:54.873\nknow when they're working,\nknow when they treat them, etc.\n\n00:13:54.897 --> 00:13:57.534\nWe're also looking at low-cost\nwater-treatment systems.\n\n00:13:57.558 --> 00:14:00.939\nOne of the really exciting things\nis looking at solar water disinfection\n\n00:14:00.963 --> 00:14:03.523\nand improving the ability\nto be able to do that.\n\n00:14:04.278 --> 00:14:08.214\nCA: What's the bottleneck\npreventing this stuff getting from scale?\n\n00:14:08.238 --> 00:14:11.494\nDo you need to find entrepreneurs,\nor venture capitalists,\n\n00:14:11.518 --> 00:14:16.374\nor what do you need to take\nwhat you've got and get it to scale?\n\n00:14:16.398 --> 00:14:19.168\nAS: I think it's large numbers\nof people moving it forward.\n\n00:14:19.192 --> 00:14:20.391\nIt's a difficult thing --\n\n00:14:20.415 --> 00:14:22.422\nit's a marketplace\nwhich is very fragmented\n\n00:14:22.446 --> 00:14:24.654\nand a consumer population with no income.\n\n00:14:24.678 --> 00:14:27.934\nSo you can't use the same models\nthat you use in the United States\n\n00:14:27.958 --> 00:14:29.494\nfor making things move forward.\n\n00:14:29.518 --> 00:14:31.534\nAnd we're a pretty small staff,\n\n00:14:31.558 --> 00:14:32.774\nwhich is me.\n\n00:14:32.798 --> 00:14:34.774\n(Laughter)\n\n00:14:34.798 --> 00:14:37.037\nSo, you know,\nI do what I can with the students.\n\n00:14:37.061 --> 00:14:39.300\nWe have 30 students a year\ngo out into the field\n\n00:14:39.324 --> 00:14:41.774\nand try to implement this\nand move it forward.\n\n00:14:41.798 --> 00:14:45.294\nThe other thing is you have to do things\nwith a long time frame,\n\n00:14:45.318 --> 00:14:49.254\nas, you know, you can't expect to get\nsomething done in a year or two years;\n\n00:14:49.278 --> 00:14:51.421\nyou have to be looking\nfive or 10 years ahead.\n\n00:14:51.445 --> 00:14:54.645\nBut I think with the vision to do that,\nwe can move forward."}, {"title": "Organic design, inspired by nature", "duration": "1170", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/ross_lovegrove_shares_organic_designs", "transcript": "My name is Lovegrove. I only know nine Lovegroves, two of which are my parents. They are first cousins, and you know what happens when, you know \u2014(Laughter)So there's a terribly weird freaky side to me, which I'm fighting with all the time. So to try and get through today, I've kind of disciplined myself with an 18-minute talk. I was hanging on to have a pee. I thought perhaps if I was hanging on long enough, that would guide me through the 18 minutes.(Laughter)OK. I am known as Captain Organic and that's a philosophical position as well as an aesthetic position. But today what I'd like to talk to you about is that love of form and how form can touch people's soul and emotion. Not very long ago, not many thousands of years ago, we actually lived in caves, and I don't think we've lost that coding system. We respond so well to form. But I'm interested in creating intelligent form. I'm not interested at all in blobism or any of that superficial rubbish that you see coming out as design. This artificially induced consumerism \u2014 I think it's atrocious.My world is the world of people like Amory Lovins, Janine Benyus, James Watson. I'm in that world, but I work purely instinctively. I'm not a scientist. I could have been, perhaps, but I work in this world where I trust my instincts. So I am a 21st-century translator of technology into products that we use everyday and relate beautifully and naturally with. And we should be developing things \u2014 we should be developing packaging for ideas which elevate people's perceptions and respect for the things that we dig out of the earth and translate into products for everyday use. So, the water bottle.I'll begin with this concept of what I call DNA. DNA: Design, Nature, Art. These are the three things that condition my world. Here is a drawing by Leonardo da Vinci, 500 years ago, before photography. It shows how observation, curiosity and instinct work to create amazing art. Industrial design is the art form of the 21st century. People like Leonardo \u2014 there have not been many \u2014 had this amazingly instinctive curiosity. I work from a similar position. I don't want to sound pretentious saying that, but this is my drawing made on a digital pad a couple of years ago \u2014 well into the 21st century, 500 years later. It's my impression of water. Impressionism being the most valuable art form on the planet as we know it: 100 million dollars, easily, for a Monet.I use, now, a whole new process. A few years ago I reinvented my process to keep up with people like Greg Lynn, Thom Mayne, Zaha Hadid, Rem Koolhaas \u2014 all these people that I think are persevering and pioneering with fantastic new ideas of how to create form. This is all created digitally. Here you see the machining, the milling of a block of acrylic. This is what I show to the client to say, \"That's what I want to do.\" At that point, I don't know if that's possible at all. It's a seductor, but I just feel in my bones that that's possible.So we go, we look at the tooling. We look at how that is produced. These are the invisible things that you never see in your life. This is the background noise of industrial design. That is like an Anish Kapoor flowing through a Richard Serra. It is more valuable than the product in my eyes. I don't have one. When I do make some money, I'll have one machined for myself. This is the final product. When they sent it to me, I thought I'd failed. It felt like nothing. It has to feel like nothing. It was when I put the water in that I realized that I'd put a skin on water itself. It's an icon of water itself, and it elevates people's perception of contemporary design. Each bottle is different, meaning the water level will give you a different shape. It's mass individualism from a single product. It fits the hand. It fits arthritic hands. It fits children's hands. It makes the product strong, the tessellation. It's a millefiori of ideas. In the future, they will look like that, because we need to move away from those type of polymers and use that for medical equipment and more important things, perhaps, in life. Biopolymers, these new ideas for materials, will come into play in probably a decade. It doesn't look as cool, does it? But I can live up to that. I don't have a problem with that. I design for that condition, biopolymers. It's the future.I took this video in Cape Town last year. This is the freaky side coming out. I have this special interest in things like this, which blow my mind. I don't know whether to, you know, drop to my knees, cry; I don't know what I think. But I just know that nature \u2014 nature improves with ever-greater purpose that which once existed, and that strangeness is a consequence of innovative thinking. When I look at these things, they look pretty normal to me. But these things evolved over many years, and what we're trying to do \u2014 I get three weeks to design a telephone. How the hell do I do that, when you get these things that take hundreds of millions of years to evolve? How do you condense that?It comes back to instinct. I'm not talking about designing telephones that look like that and I'm not looking at designing architecture like that. I'm just interested in natural growth patterns and the beautiful forms that only nature really creates. How that flows through me and how that comes out is what I'm trying to understand.This is a scan through the human forearm. It's then blown up through rapid prototyping to reveal its cellular structure. I have these in my office. My office is a mixture of the Natural History Museum and a NASA space lab. It's a weird, kind of freaky place. This is one of my specimens.This is made \u2014 bone is made from a mixture of inorganic minerals and polymers. I studied cooking in school for four years, and in that experience, which was called \"domestic science,\" it was a bit of a cheap trick for me to try and get a science qualification.(Laughter)Actually, I put marijuana in everything I cooked \u2014(Laughter)And I had access to all the best girls. It was fabulous. All the guys in the rugby team couldn't understand. Anyway \u2014 this is a meringue. This is another sample I have. A meringue is made exactly the same way, in my estimation, as a bone. It's made from polysaccharides and proteins. If you pour water on that, it dissolves. Could we be manufacturing from foodstuffs in the future? Not a bad idea. I don't know. I need to talk to Janine and a few other people about that, but I believe instinctively that that meringue can become something, a car \u2014 I don't know.I'm also interested in growth patterns: the unbridled way that nature grows things so you're not restricted by form at all. These interrelated forms, they do inspire everything I do, although I might end up making something incredibly simple. This is a detail of a chair that I've designed in magnesium. It shows this interlocution of elements and the beauty of, kind of, engineering and biological thinking, shown pretty much as a bone structure. Any one of those elements you could sort of hang on the wall as some kind of art object.It's the world's first chair made in magnesium. It cost 1.7 million dollars to develop. It's called \"Go,\" by Bernhardt, USA. It went into Time magazine in 2001 as the new language of the 21st century. Boy. For somebody growing up in Wales in a little village, that's enough. It shows how you make one holistic form, like the car industry, and then you break up what you need. This is an absolutely beautiful way of working. It's a godly way of working. It's organic and it's essential. It's an absolutely fat-free design, and when you look at it, you see human beings.When that moves into polymers, you can change the elasticity, the fluidity of the form. This is an idea for a gas-injected, one-piece polymer chair. What nature does is it drills holes in things. It liberates form. It takes away anything extraneous. That's what I do. I make organic things which are essential. And they look funky, too \u2014 but I don't set out to make funky things because I think that's an absolute disgrace.I set out to look at natural forms. If you took the idea of fractal technology further, take a membrane, shrinking it down constantly like nature does \u2014 that could be a seat for a chair. It could be a sole for a sports shoe. It could be a car blending into seats. Wow. Let's go for it. That's the kind of stuff. This is what exists in nature. Observation now allows us to bring that natural process into the design process every day. That's what I do.This is a show that's currently on in Tokyo. It's called \"Superliquidity.\" It's my sculptural investigation. It's like 21st-century Henry Moore. When you see a Henry Moore, still, your hair stands up. There's some amazing spiritual connect. If he was a car designer, phew, we'd all be driving one. In his day, he was the highest taxpayer in Britain.That is the power of organic design. It contributes immensely to our \u2014 sense of being, our sense of relationships with things, our sensuality and, you know, the sort of \u2014 even the sort of socio-erotic side, which is very important. This is my artwork. This is all my process. These actually are sold as artwork. They're very big prints. But this is how I get to that object.Ironically, that object was made by the Killarney process, which is a brand-new process here for the 21st century, and I can hear Greg Lynn laughing his socks off as I say that. I'll tell you about that later.When I look into these data images, I see new things. It's self-inspired. Diatomic structures, radiolaria, the things that we couldn't see but we can do now \u2014 these, again, are cored out. They're made virtually from nothing. They're made from silica. Why not structures from cars like that? Coral, all these natural forces, take away what they don't need and they deliver maximum beauty. We need to be in that realm. I want to do stuff like that.This is a new chair which should come on the market in September. It's for a company called Moroso in Italy. It's a gas-injected polymer chair. Those holes you see there are very filtered-down, watered-down versions of the extremity of the diatomic structures. It goes with the flow of the polymer and you'll see \u2014 there's an image coming up right now that shows the full thing. It's great to have companies in Italy who support this way of dreaming. If you see the shadows that come through that, they're actually probably more important than the product, but it's the minimum it takes. The coring out of the back lets you breathe. It takes away any material you don't need and it actually garners flexure too.I was going to break into a dance then.This is some current work I'm doing. I'm looking at single-surface structures and how they stretch and flow. It's based on furniture typologies, but that's not the end motivation. It's made from aluminum ... as opposed to aluminium, and it's grown. It's grown in my mind, and then it's grown in terms of the whole process that I go through.This is two weeks ago in CCP in Coventry, who build parts for Bentleys and so on. It's being built as we speak and it will be on show in Phillips next year in New York. I have a big show with Phillips Auctioneers. When I see these animations, oh Jesus, I'm blown away. This is what goes on in my studio everyday. I walk \u2014 I'm traveling. I come back. Some guy's got that on a computer \u2014 there's this like, oh my goodness. So I try to create this energy of invention every day in my studio. This kind of effervescent \u2014 fully charged sense of soup that delivers ideas.Single-surface products. Furniture's a good one. How you grow legs out of a surface. I would love to build this one day and perhaps I'd like to build it also out of flour, sugar, polymer, wood chips \u2014 I don't know, human hair. I don't know. I'd love a go at that. I don't know. If I just got some time. That's the weird side coming out again. A lot of companies don't understand that.Three weeks ago I was with Sony in Tokyo. They said, \"Give us the dream. What is our dream? How do we beat Apple?\" I said, \"You don't copy Apple, that's for sure. You get into biopolymers.\" They looked straight through me. What a waste. Anyway.(Laughter)No, it's true. Fuck them. You know, I mean \u2014(Laughter)I'm delivering; they're not taking. I've had this image 20 years. I've had this image of a water droplet for 20 years, sitting on a hot bed. That is an image of a car for me. That's the car of the future. It's a water droplet. I've been banging on about this like I can't believe. Cars are all wrong.I'm going to show you something a bit weird now. They laughed everywhere over the world I showed this. The only place that didn't laugh was Moscow. Cars are made from 30,000 components. How ridiculous is that? Couldn't you make that from 300? It's got a vacuum-formed, carbon-nylon pan. Everything's holistically integrated. It opens and closes like a bread bin. There is no engine. There's a solar panel on the back and there are batteries in the wheels; they're fitted like Formula 1. You take them off your wall, you plug them in. Off you go. A three-wheeled car: slow, feminine, transparent, so you can see the people in there. You drive different. You see that thing. You do. You do. And not anesthetized, separated from life. There's a hole at the front and there's a reason for that. It's a city car. You drive along. You get out. You drive on to a proboscis. You get out. It lifts you up. It presents the solar panel to the sun, and at night, it's a street lamp.(Applause)That's what happens if you get inspired by the street lamp first, and do the car second. I can see these bubbles with these hydrogen packages, floating around on the ground, driven by AI. When I showed this in South Africa, everybody afterwards was going, \"Hey, car on a stick. Like this.\" Can you imagine? A car on a stick.(Laughter)If you put it next to contemporary architecture, it feels totally natural to me. And that's what I do with my furniture. I'm not putting Charles Eames' furniture in buildings anymore. I'm trying to build furniture which fits architecture. I'm trying to build transportation systems. I work on aircraft for Airbus, I do all this sort of stuff trying to force these natural, inspired-by-nature dreams home.I'm going to finish on two things. This is the stereolithography of a staircase. It's a little bit of a dedication to James, James Watson. I built this thing for my studio. It cost me 250,000 dollars to build this. Most people go and buy the Aston Martin. I built this. This is the data that goes with that. Incredibly complex. Took about two years, because I'm looking for fat-free design. Lean, efficient things. Healthy products. This is built by composites. It's a single element which rotates around to create a holistic element, and this is a carbon-fiber handrail which is only supported in two places. Modern materials allow us to do modern things.This is a shot in the studio. This is how it looks pretty much every day. You wouldn't want to have a fear of heights coming down it. There is virtually no handrail. It doesn't pass any standards.(Laughter)Who cares?(Laughter)And it has an internal handrail which gives it its strength. It's this holistic integration. That's my studio. It's subterranean. It's in Notting Hill, next to all the crap \u2014 the prostitutes and all that stuff. It's next to David Hockney's original studio. It has a lighting system that changes throughout the day. My guys go out for lunch. The door's open. They come back in, because it's normally raining and they prefer to stay in.This is my studio. Elephant skull from Oxford University, 1988. I bought that last year. They're very difficult to find. If anybody's got a whale skeleton they want to sell me, I'll put it in the studio.So I'm just going to interject a little bit with some of the things that you'll see in the video. It's a homemade video, made it myself at three o'clock in the morning just to show you how my real world is. You never see that. You never see architects or designers showing you their real world.This is called a \"Plasnet.\" It's a new bio-polycarbonate chair I'm doing in Italy.World's first bamboo bike with folding handlebars. We should all be riding one of these. As China buys all these crappy cars, we should be riding things like this. Counterbalance.Like I say, it's a cross between Natural History Museum and a NASA laboratory. It's full of prototypes and objects. It's self-inspirational, again. I mean, the rare times when I'm there, I do enjoy it. And I get lots and lots of kids coming. I'm a contaminator for all those children of investment bankers \u2014 wankers. Sorry.(Laughter)That's a solar seed. It's a concept for new architecture. That thing on the top is the world's first solar-powered garden lamp \u2014 the first produced. Giles Revell should be talking here today \u2014 amazing photography of things you can't see.The first sculptural model I made for that thing in Tokyo.Lots of stuff. There's a little leaf chair \u2014 that golden looking thing is called \"Leaf.\" It's made from Kevlar.On the wall is my book called \"Supernatural,\" which allows me to remember what I've done, because I forget.There's an aerated brick I did in Limoges last year, in Concepts for New Ceramics in Architecture.Gernot Oberfell, working at three o'clock in the morning \u2014 and I don't pay overtime. Overtime is the passion of design, so join the club or don't.(Laughter)No, it's true. People like Tom and Greg \u2014 we're traveling like you can't \u2014 we fit it all in. I don't know how we do it.Next week I'm at Electrolux in Sweden, then I'm in Beijing on Friday. You work that one out. And when I see Ed's photographs, I think, why the hell am I going to China? It's true. It's true. Because there's a soul in this whole thing. We need to have a new instinct for the 21st century. We need to combine all this stuff. If all the people who were talking over this period worked on a car together, it would be a joy, absolute joy.So there's a new X-light system I'm doing in Japan.There's Tuareg shoes from North Africa. There's a Kifwebe mask.These are my sculptures.A copper jelly mold.(Laughter)It sounds like some quiz show or something, doesn't it? So, it's going to end. Thank you, James, for your great inspiration.Thank you very much.(Applause)", "id": 27, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:11.958 --> 00:00:13.174\nMy name is Lovegrove.\n\n00:00:13.198 --> 00:00:17.294\nI only know nine Lovegroves,\ntwo of which are my parents.\n\n00:00:17.318 --> 00:00:21.134\nThey are first cousins, and you know\nwhat happens when, you know --\n\n00:00:21.158 --> 00:00:22.374\n(Laughter)\n\n00:00:22.398 --> 00:00:26.614\nSo there's a terribly weird\nfreaky side to me,\n\n00:00:26.638 --> 00:00:28.494\nwhich I'm fighting with all the time.\n\n00:00:28.518 --> 00:00:31.294\nSo to try and get through today,\n\n00:00:31.318 --> 00:00:34.374\nI've kind of disciplined myself\nwith an 18-minute talk.\n\n00:00:34.398 --> 00:00:35.894\nI was hanging on to have a pee.\n\n00:00:35.918 --> 00:00:38.254\nI thought perhaps\nif I was hanging on long enough,\n\n00:00:38.278 --> 00:00:40.278\nthat would guide me\nthrough the 18 minutes.\n\n00:00:40.302 --> 00:00:42.614\n(Laughter)\n\n00:00:42.638 --> 00:00:49.134\nOK. I am known as Captain Organic\n\n00:00:49.158 --> 00:00:52.397\nand that's a philosophical position\nas well as an aesthetic position.\n\n00:00:53.958 --> 00:00:57.774\nBut today what I'd like to talk\nto you about is that love of form\n\n00:00:57.798 --> 00:01:01.758\nand how form can touch\npeople's soul and emotion.\n\n00:01:03.638 --> 00:01:08.574\nNot very long ago,\nnot many thousands of years ago,\n\n00:01:08.598 --> 00:01:10.534\nwe actually lived in caves,\n\n00:01:10.558 --> 00:01:14.814\nand I don't think\nwe've lost that coding system.\n\n00:01:14.838 --> 00:01:17.974\nWe respond so well to form.\n\n00:01:17.998 --> 00:01:20.454\nBut I'm interested\nin creating intelligent form.\n\n00:01:20.478 --> 00:01:22.414\nI'm not interested at all in blobism\n\n00:01:22.438 --> 00:01:26.454\nor any of that superficial rubbish\nthat you see coming out as design.\n\n00:01:26.478 --> 00:01:31.118\nThis artificially induced\nconsumerism -- I think it's atrocious.\n\n00:01:31.558 --> 00:01:36.174\nMy world is the world\nof people like Amory Lovins,\n\n00:01:36.198 --> 00:01:38.654\nJanine Benyus, James Watson.\n\n00:01:38.678 --> 00:01:42.294\nI'm in that world,\nbut I work purely instinctively.\n\n00:01:42.318 --> 00:01:45.054\nI'm not a scientist.\nI could have been, perhaps,\n\n00:01:45.078 --> 00:01:47.894\nbut I work in this world\nwhere I trust my instincts.\n\n00:01:47.918 --> 00:01:54.574\nSo I am a 21st-century\ntranslator of technology\n\n00:01:54.598 --> 00:01:59.734\ninto products that we use everyday\nand relate beautifully and naturally with.\n\n00:01:59.758 --> 00:02:03.494\nAnd we should be developing things --\nwe should be developing packaging\n\n00:02:03.518 --> 00:02:07.374\nfor ideas which elevate\npeople's perceptions\n\n00:02:07.398 --> 00:02:10.894\nand respect for the things\nthat we dig out of the earth\n\n00:02:10.918 --> 00:02:13.174\nand translate into products\nfor everyday use.\n\n00:02:13.198 --> 00:02:15.654\nSo, the water bottle.\n\n00:02:15.678 --> 00:02:18.334\nI'll begin with this concept\nof what I call DNA.\n\n00:02:18.358 --> 00:02:20.534\nDNA: Design, Nature, Art.\n\n00:02:20.558 --> 00:02:22.939\nThese are the three things\nthat condition my world.\n\n00:02:22.963 --> 00:02:28.454\nHere is a drawing by Leonardo da Vinci,\n500 years ago, before photography.\n\n00:02:28.478 --> 00:02:33.534\nIt shows how observation,\ncuriosity and instinct\n\n00:02:33.558 --> 00:02:36.774\nwork to create amazing art.\n\n00:02:36.798 --> 00:02:39.574\nIndustrial design is the art form\nof the 21st century.\n\n00:02:39.598 --> 00:02:43.134\nPeople like Leonardo --\nthere have not been many --\n\n00:02:43.158 --> 00:02:46.774\nhad this amazingly instinctive curiosity.\n\n00:02:46.798 --> 00:02:48.294\nI work from a similar position.\n\n00:02:48.318 --> 00:02:50.461\nI don't want to sound\npretentious saying that,\n\n00:02:50.485 --> 00:02:54.254\nbut this is my drawing made\non a digital pad a couple of years ago --\n\n00:02:54.278 --> 00:02:56.614\nwell into the 21st century,\n500 years later.\n\n00:02:56.638 --> 00:02:59.614\nIt's my impression of water.\n\n00:02:59.638 --> 00:03:03.162\nImpressionism being the most valuable\nart form on the planet as we know it:\n\n00:03:03.186 --> 00:03:05.534\n100 million dollars, easily, for a Monet.\n\n00:03:05.558 --> 00:03:07.414\nI use, now, a whole new process.\n\n00:03:07.438 --> 00:03:09.414\nA few years ago I reinvented my process\n\n00:03:09.438 --> 00:03:13.974\nto keep up with people like Greg Lynn,\nThom Mayne, Zaha Hadid, Rem Koolhaas --\n\n00:03:13.998 --> 00:03:17.334\nall these people that I think\nare persevering and pioneering\n\n00:03:17.358 --> 00:03:21.374\nwith fantastic new ideas\nof how to create form.\n\n00:03:21.398 --> 00:03:22.894\nThis is all created digitally.\n\n00:03:22.918 --> 00:03:26.174\nHere you see the machining,\nthe milling of a block of acrylic.\n\n00:03:26.198 --> 00:03:29.437\nThis is what I show to the client to say,\n\"That's what I want to do.\"\n\n00:03:29.461 --> 00:03:31.985\nAt that point, I don't know\nif that's possible at all.\n\n00:03:32.009 --> 00:03:36.466\nIt's a seductor, but I just feel\nin my bones that that's possible.\n\n00:03:37.918 --> 00:03:40.094\nSo we go, we look at the tooling.\n\n00:03:40.118 --> 00:03:41.734\nWe look at how that is produced.\n\n00:03:41.758 --> 00:03:44.711\nThese are the invisible things\nthat you never see in your life.\n\n00:03:44.735 --> 00:03:47.294\nThis is the background noise\nof industrial design.\n\n00:03:47.318 --> 00:03:51.134\nThat is like an Anish Kapoor\nflowing through a Richard Serra.\n\n00:03:51.158 --> 00:03:53.397\nIt is more valuable\nthan the product in my eyes.\n\n00:03:53.421 --> 00:03:54.803\nI don't have one.\n\n00:03:54.827 --> 00:03:57.715\nWhen I do make some money,\nI'll have one machined for myself.\n\n00:03:57.739 --> 00:03:58.992\nThis is the final product.\n\n00:03:59.016 --> 00:04:01.233\nWhen they sent it to me,\nI thought I'd failed.\n\n00:04:01.257 --> 00:04:03.614\nIt felt like nothing.\nIt has to feel like nothing.\n\n00:04:03.638 --> 00:04:05.174\nIt was when I put the water in\n\n00:04:05.198 --> 00:04:07.854\nthat I realized that I'd put\na skin on water itself.\n\n00:04:07.878 --> 00:04:09.894\nIt's an icon of water itself,\n\n00:04:09.918 --> 00:04:13.734\nand it elevates people's perception\nof contemporary design.\n\n00:04:13.758 --> 00:04:15.094\nEach bottle is different,\n\n00:04:15.118 --> 00:04:17.738\nmeaning the water level\nwill give you a different shape.\n\n00:04:17.762 --> 00:04:20.774\nIt's mass individualism\nfrom a single product.\n\n00:04:20.798 --> 00:04:22.014\nIt fits the hand.\n\n00:04:22.038 --> 00:04:24.374\nIt fits arthritic hands.\nIt fits children's hands.\n\n00:04:24.398 --> 00:04:26.541\nIt makes the product strong,\nthe tessellation.\n\n00:04:26.565 --> 00:04:28.854\nIt's a millefiori of ideas.\n\n00:04:28.878 --> 00:04:31.614\nIn the future, they will look like that,\n\n00:04:31.638 --> 00:04:34.265\nbecause we need to move away\nfrom those type of polymers\n\n00:04:34.289 --> 00:04:35.916\nand use that for medical equipment\n\n00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:37.996\nand more important things,\nperhaps, in life.\n\n00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:40.694\nBiopolymers, these new\nideas for materials,\n\n00:04:40.718 --> 00:04:43.134\nwill come into play in probably a decade.\n\n00:04:43.158 --> 00:04:44.734\nIt doesn't look as cool, does it?\n\n00:04:44.758 --> 00:04:47.814\nBut I can live up to that.\nI don't have a problem with that.\n\n00:04:47.838 --> 00:04:51.518\nI design for that condition,\nbiopolymers. It's the future.\n\n00:04:52.718 --> 00:04:55.134\nI took this video in Cape Town last year.\n\n00:04:55.158 --> 00:04:56.894\nThis is the freaky side coming out.\n\n00:04:56.918 --> 00:05:01.454\nI have this special interest\nin things like this, which blow my mind.\n\n00:05:01.478 --> 00:05:04.414\nI don't know whether to,\nyou know, drop to my knees, cry;\n\n00:05:04.438 --> 00:05:05.694\nI don't know what I think.\n\n00:05:05.718 --> 00:05:07.718\nBut I just know that nature --\n\n00:05:09.078 --> 00:05:14.054\nnature improves with ever-greater purpose\n\n00:05:14.078 --> 00:05:17.014\nthat which once existed,\n\n00:05:17.038 --> 00:05:20.174\nand that strangeness\nis a consequence of innovative thinking.\n\n00:05:20.198 --> 00:05:23.454\nWhen I look at these things,\nthey look pretty normal to me.\n\n00:05:23.478 --> 00:05:26.859\nBut these things evolved over many years,\nand what we're trying to do --\n\n00:05:26.883 --> 00:05:30.054\nI get three weeks to design a telephone.\nHow the hell do I do that,\n\n00:05:30.078 --> 00:05:33.674\nwhen you get these things that take\nhundreds of millions of years to evolve?\n\n00:05:33.698 --> 00:05:35.094\nHow do you condense that?\n\n00:05:35.118 --> 00:05:36.654\nIt comes back to instinct.\n\n00:05:36.678 --> 00:05:39.614\nI'm not talking about designing\ntelephones that look like that\n\n00:05:39.638 --> 00:05:42.258\nand I'm not looking\nat designing architecture like that.\n\n00:05:42.282 --> 00:05:44.494\nI'm just interested\nin natural growth patterns\n\n00:05:44.518 --> 00:05:48.694\nand the beautiful forms\nthat only nature really creates.\n\n00:05:48.718 --> 00:05:51.494\nHow that flows through me\nand how that comes out\n\n00:05:51.518 --> 00:05:53.134\nis what I'm trying to understand.\n\n00:05:53.158 --> 00:05:56.054\nThis is a scan through the human forearm.\n\n00:05:56.078 --> 00:05:59.094\nIt's then blown up\nthrough rapid prototyping\n\n00:05:59.118 --> 00:06:00.694\nto reveal its cellular structure.\n\n00:06:00.718 --> 00:06:02.214\nI have these in my office.\n\n00:06:02.238 --> 00:06:05.254\nMy office is a mixture\nof the Natural History Museum\n\n00:06:05.278 --> 00:06:06.934\nand a NASA space lab.\n\n00:06:06.958 --> 00:06:09.774\nIt's a weird, kind of freaky place.\n\n00:06:09.798 --> 00:06:11.894\nThis is one of my specimens.\n\n00:06:11.918 --> 00:06:13.134\nThis is made --\n\n00:06:13.158 --> 00:06:19.934\nbone is made from a mixture\nof inorganic minerals and polymers.\n\n00:06:19.958 --> 00:06:24.694\nI studied cooking in school\nfor four years, and in that experience,\n\n00:06:24.718 --> 00:06:26.433\nwhich was called \"domestic science,\"\n\n00:06:26.457 --> 00:06:30.029\nit was a bit of a cheap trick for me\nto try and get a science qualification.\n\n00:06:30.053 --> 00:06:31.614\n(Laughter)\n\n00:06:31.638 --> 00:06:34.334\nActually, I put marijuana\nin everything I cooked --\n\n00:06:34.358 --> 00:06:35.574\n(Laughter)\n\n00:06:35.598 --> 00:06:38.218\nAnd I had access to all\nthe best girls. It was fabulous.\n\n00:06:38.242 --> 00:06:40.623\nAll the guys in the rugby team\ncouldn't understand.\n\n00:06:40.647 --> 00:06:42.214\nAnyway -- this is a meringue.\n\n00:06:42.238 --> 00:06:43.694\nThis is another sample I have.\n\n00:06:43.718 --> 00:06:47.094\nA meringue is made exactly the same way,\nin my estimation, as a bone.\n\n00:06:47.118 --> 00:06:50.774\nIt's made from\npolysaccharides and proteins.\n\n00:06:50.798 --> 00:06:52.974\nIf you pour water on that, it dissolves.\n\n00:06:52.998 --> 00:06:56.654\nCould we be manufacturing\nfrom foodstuffs in the future?\n\n00:06:56.678 --> 00:06:58.454\nNot a bad idea. I don't know.\n\n00:06:58.478 --> 00:07:01.240\nI need to talk to Janine\nand a few other people about that,\n\n00:07:01.264 --> 00:07:05.054\nbut I believe instinctively that\nthat meringue can become something,\n\n00:07:05.078 --> 00:07:06.278\na car -- I don't know.\n\n00:07:07.276 --> 00:07:09.134\nI'm also interested in growth patterns:\n\n00:07:09.158 --> 00:07:13.654\nthe unbridled way that nature grows things\n\n00:07:13.678 --> 00:07:16.254\nso you're not restricted by form at all.\n\n00:07:16.278 --> 00:07:19.934\nThese interrelated forms,\nthey do inspire everything I do,\n\n00:07:19.958 --> 00:07:23.414\nalthough I might end up\nmaking something incredibly simple.\n\n00:07:23.438 --> 00:07:26.654\nThis is a detail of a chair\nthat I've designed in magnesium.\n\n00:07:26.678 --> 00:07:31.734\nIt shows this interlocution of elements\nand the beauty of, kind of, engineering\n\n00:07:31.758 --> 00:07:33.743\nand biological thinking,\n\n00:07:33.767 --> 00:07:35.854\nshown pretty much as a bone structure.\n\n00:07:35.878 --> 00:07:38.694\nAny one of those elements\nyou could sort of hang on the wall\n\n00:07:38.718 --> 00:07:40.374\nas some kind of art object.\n\n00:07:40.398 --> 00:07:43.174\nIt's the world's first chair\nmade in magnesium.\n\n00:07:43.198 --> 00:07:45.254\nIt cost 1.7 million dollars to develop.\n\n00:07:45.278 --> 00:07:48.254\nIt's called \"Go,\" by Bernhardt, USA.\n\n00:07:48.278 --> 00:07:54.014\nIt went into Time magazine in 2001\nas the new language of the 21st century.\n\n00:07:54.038 --> 00:07:57.838\nBoy. For somebody growing up in Wales\nin a little village, that's enough.\n\n00:07:59.158 --> 00:08:02.134\nIt shows how you make one holistic form,\nlike the car industry,\n\n00:08:02.158 --> 00:08:03.873\nand then you break up what you need.\n\n00:08:03.897 --> 00:08:06.094\nThis is an absolutely\nbeautiful way of working.\n\n00:08:06.118 --> 00:08:08.374\nIt's a godly way of working.\n\n00:08:08.398 --> 00:08:10.654\nIt's organic and it's essential.\n\n00:08:10.678 --> 00:08:12.345\nIt's an absolutely fat-free design,\n\n00:08:12.369 --> 00:08:16.254\nand when you look at it,\nyou see human beings.\n\n00:08:16.278 --> 00:08:17.707\nWhen that moves into polymers,\n\n00:08:17.731 --> 00:08:22.094\nyou can change the elasticity,\nthe fluidity of the form.\n\n00:08:22.118 --> 00:08:25.734\nThis is an idea for a gas-injected,\none-piece polymer chair.\n\n00:08:25.758 --> 00:08:28.534\nWhat nature does\nis it drills holes in things.\n\n00:08:28.558 --> 00:08:29.774\nIt liberates form.\n\n00:08:29.798 --> 00:08:31.894\nIt takes away anything extraneous.\n\n00:08:31.918 --> 00:08:33.134\nThat's what I do.\n\n00:08:33.158 --> 00:08:35.574\nI make organic things which are essential.\n\n00:08:35.598 --> 00:08:39.694\nAnd they look funky, too --\nbut I don't set out to make funky things\n\n00:08:39.718 --> 00:08:41.774\nbecause I think\nthat's an absolute disgrace.\n\n00:08:41.798 --> 00:08:43.894\nI set out to look at natural forms.\n\n00:08:43.918 --> 00:08:47.894\nIf you took the idea of fractal technology\nfurther, take a membrane,\n\n00:08:47.918 --> 00:08:50.613\nshrinking it down constantly\nlike nature does --\n\n00:08:50.637 --> 00:08:52.214\nthat could be a seat for a chair.\n\n00:08:52.238 --> 00:08:54.014\nIt could be a sole for a sports shoe.\n\n00:08:54.038 --> 00:08:56.894\nIt could be a car blending into seats.\n\n00:08:56.918 --> 00:08:59.574\nWow. Let's go for it.\nThat's the kind of stuff.\n\n00:08:59.598 --> 00:09:01.414\nThis is what exists in nature.\n\n00:09:01.438 --> 00:09:06.374\nObservation now allows us\nto bring that natural process\n\n00:09:06.398 --> 00:09:08.414\ninto the design process every day.\n\n00:09:08.438 --> 00:09:09.654\nThat's what I do.\n\n00:09:09.678 --> 00:09:11.734\nThis is a show\nthat's currently on in Tokyo.\n\n00:09:11.758 --> 00:09:15.414\nIt's called \"Superliquidity.\"\nIt's my sculptural investigation.\n\n00:09:15.438 --> 00:09:18.094\nIt's like 21st-century Henry Moore.\n\n00:09:18.118 --> 00:09:21.934\nWhen you see a Henry Moore, still,\nyour hair stands up.\n\n00:09:21.958 --> 00:09:24.174\nThere's some amazing spiritual connect.\n\n00:09:24.198 --> 00:09:28.094\nIf he was a car designer,\nphew, we'd all be driving one.\n\n00:09:28.118 --> 00:09:31.294\nIn his day, he was\nthe highest taxpayer in Britain.\n\n00:09:31.318 --> 00:09:33.694\nThat is the power of organic design.\n\n00:09:33.718 --> 00:09:37.118\nIt contributes immensely to our --\n\n00:09:38.678 --> 00:09:40.214\nsense of being,\n\n00:09:40.238 --> 00:09:42.096\nour sense of relationships with things,\n\n00:09:42.120 --> 00:09:44.294\nour sensuality and,\nyou know, the sort of --\n\n00:09:44.318 --> 00:09:48.334\neven the sort of socio-erotic side,\nwhich is very important.\n\n00:09:48.358 --> 00:09:50.854\nThis is my artwork.\nThis is all my process.\n\n00:09:50.878 --> 00:09:54.894\nThese actually are sold as artwork.\nThey're very big prints.\n\n00:09:54.918 --> 00:09:57.414\nBut this is how I get to that object.\n\n00:09:57.438 --> 00:10:00.614\nIronically, that object was made\nby the Killarney process,\n\n00:10:00.638 --> 00:10:03.254\nwhich is a brand-new process here\nfor the 21st century,\n\n00:10:03.278 --> 00:10:06.294\nand I can hear Greg Lynn\nlaughing his socks off as I say that.\n\n00:10:06.318 --> 00:10:08.014\nI'll tell you about that later.\n\n00:10:08.038 --> 00:10:11.814\nWhen I look into these data images,\n\n00:10:11.838 --> 00:10:13.574\nI see new things.\n\n00:10:13.598 --> 00:10:16.174\nIt's self-inspired.\n\n00:10:16.198 --> 00:10:18.054\nDiatomic structures, radiolaria,\n\n00:10:18.078 --> 00:10:20.507\nthe things that we couldn't see\nbut we can do now --\n\n00:10:20.531 --> 00:10:21.867\nthese, again, are cored out.\n\n00:10:21.891 --> 00:10:25.294\nThey're made virtually from nothing.\nThey're made from silica.\n\n00:10:25.318 --> 00:10:27.494\nWhy not structures from cars like that?\n\n00:10:27.518 --> 00:10:30.614\nCoral, all these natural forces,\n\n00:10:30.638 --> 00:10:35.814\ntake away what they don't need\nand they deliver maximum beauty.\n\n00:10:35.838 --> 00:10:38.094\nWe need to be in that realm.\n\n00:10:38.118 --> 00:10:40.494\nI want to do stuff like that.\n\n00:10:40.518 --> 00:10:43.566\nThis is a new chair which should\ncome on the market in September.\n\n00:10:43.590 --> 00:10:47.414\nIt's for a company called Moroso in Italy.\nIt's a gas-injected polymer chair.\n\n00:10:47.438 --> 00:10:50.094\nThose holes you see there\nare very filtered-down,\n\n00:10:50.118 --> 00:10:54.134\nwatered-down versions of the extremity\nof the diatomic structures.\n\n00:10:54.158 --> 00:10:56.682\nIt goes with the flow\nof the polymer and you'll see --\n\n00:10:56.706 --> 00:10:59.694\nthere's an image coming up\nright now that shows the full thing.\n\n00:10:59.718 --> 00:11:03.614\nIt's great to have companies in Italy\nwho support this way of dreaming.\n\n00:11:03.638 --> 00:11:05.789\nIf you see the shadows\nthat come through that,\n\n00:11:05.813 --> 00:11:08.535\nthey're actually probably\nmore important than the product,\n\n00:11:08.559 --> 00:11:09.996\nbut it's the minimum it takes.\n\n00:11:10.020 --> 00:11:12.294\nThe coring out of the back\nlets you breathe.\n\n00:11:12.318 --> 00:11:14.271\nIt takes away any material you don't need\n\n00:11:14.295 --> 00:11:16.575\nand it actually garners flexure too.\n\n00:11:18.278 --> 00:11:21.374\nI was going to break into a dance then.\n\n00:11:21.398 --> 00:11:23.334\nThis is some current work I'm doing.\n\n00:11:23.358 --> 00:11:25.414\nI'm looking at single-surface structures\n\n00:11:25.438 --> 00:11:28.134\nand how they stretch and flow.\n\n00:11:28.158 --> 00:11:33.638\nIt's based on furniture typologies,\nbut that's not the end motivation.\n\n00:11:33.998 --> 00:11:35.598\nIt's made from aluminum ...\n\n00:11:36.758 --> 00:11:40.014\nas opposed to aluminium, and it's grown.\n\n00:11:40.038 --> 00:11:41.254\nIt's grown in my mind,\n\n00:11:41.278 --> 00:11:45.854\nand then it's grown in terms\nof the whole process that I go through.\n\n00:11:45.878 --> 00:11:50.534\nThis is two weeks ago in CCP in Coventry,\nwho build parts for Bentleys and so on.\n\n00:11:50.558 --> 00:11:52.734\nIt's being built as we speak\n\n00:11:52.758 --> 00:11:55.734\nand it will be on show in Phillips\nnext year in New York.\n\n00:11:55.758 --> 00:11:58.614\nI have a big show\nwith Phillips Auctioneers.\n\n00:11:58.638 --> 00:12:01.614\nWhen I see these animations,\noh Jesus, I'm blown away.\n\n00:12:01.638 --> 00:12:03.654\nThis is what goes on\nin my studio everyday.\n\n00:12:03.678 --> 00:12:05.454\nI walk -- I'm traveling. I come back.\n\n00:12:05.478 --> 00:12:08.812\nSome guy's got that on a computer --\nthere's this like, oh my goodness.\n\n00:12:08.836 --> 00:12:12.574\nSo I try to create this energy\nof invention every day in my studio.\n\n00:12:12.598 --> 00:12:14.614\nThis kind of effervescent --\n\n00:12:14.638 --> 00:12:20.214\nfully charged sense of soup\nthat delivers ideas.\n\n00:12:20.238 --> 00:12:22.214\nSingle-surface products.\n\n00:12:22.238 --> 00:12:23.934\nFurniture's a good one.\n\n00:12:23.958 --> 00:12:26.774\nHow you grow legs out of a surface.\n\n00:12:26.798 --> 00:12:28.418\nI would love to build this one day\n\n00:12:28.442 --> 00:12:31.414\nand perhaps I'd like\nto build it also out of flour, sugar,\n\n00:12:31.438 --> 00:12:35.054\npolymer, wood chips --\nI don't know, human hair.\n\n00:12:35.078 --> 00:12:38.774\nI don't know. I'd love a go at that.\nI don't know. If I just got some time.\n\n00:12:38.798 --> 00:12:42.614\nThat's the weird side coming out again.\nA lot of companies don't understand that.\n\n00:12:42.638 --> 00:12:45.334\nThree weeks ago I was with Sony in Tokyo.\n\n00:12:45.358 --> 00:12:48.755\nThey said, \"Give us the dream.\nWhat is our dream? How do we beat Apple?\"\n\n00:12:48.779 --> 00:12:50.978\nI said, \"You don't copy Apple,\nthat's for sure.\n\n00:12:51.002 --> 00:12:52.262\nYou get into biopolymers.\"\n\n00:12:52.286 --> 00:12:53.921\nThey looked straight through me.\n\n00:12:54.878 --> 00:12:56.694\nWhat a waste. Anyway.\n\n00:12:56.718 --> 00:12:57.934\n(Laughter)\n\n00:12:57.958 --> 00:13:01.174\nNo, it's true. Fuck them.\nYou know, I mean --\n\n00:13:01.198 --> 00:13:02.534\n(Laughter)\n\n00:13:02.558 --> 00:13:04.774\nI'm delivering; they're not taking.\n\n00:13:04.798 --> 00:13:06.334\nI've had this image 20 years.\n\n00:13:06.358 --> 00:13:09.974\nI've had this image of a water droplet\nfor 20 years, sitting on a hot bed.\n\n00:13:09.998 --> 00:13:11.774\nThat is an image of a car for me.\n\n00:13:11.798 --> 00:13:14.179\nThat's the car of the future.\nIt's a water droplet.\n\n00:13:14.203 --> 00:13:16.774\nI've been banging on about this\nlike I can't believe.\n\n00:13:16.798 --> 00:13:18.014\nCars are all wrong.\n\n00:13:18.038 --> 00:13:20.277\nI'm going to show you\nsomething a bit weird now.\n\n00:13:20.301 --> 00:13:22.894\nThey laughed everywhere\nover the world I showed this.\n\n00:13:22.918 --> 00:13:24.974\nThe only place\nthat didn't laugh was Moscow.\n\n00:13:24.998 --> 00:13:26.814\nCars are made from 30,000 components.\n\n00:13:26.838 --> 00:13:32.494\nHow ridiculous is that?\nCouldn't you make that from 300?\n\n00:13:32.518 --> 00:13:35.654\nIt's got a vacuum-formed,\ncarbon-nylon pan.\n\n00:13:35.678 --> 00:13:39.210\nEverything's holistically integrated.\nIt opens and closes like a bread bin.\n\n00:13:39.234 --> 00:13:41.717\nThere is no engine.\nThere's a solar panel on the back\n\n00:13:41.741 --> 00:13:45.041\nand there are batteries in the wheels;\nthey're fitted like Formula 1.\n\n00:13:45.065 --> 00:13:47.875\nYou take them off your wall,\nyou plug them in. Off you go.\n\n00:13:47.899 --> 00:13:50.614\nA three-wheeled car: slow, feminine,\n\n00:13:50.638 --> 00:13:52.877\ntransparent, so you can see\nthe people in there.\n\n00:13:52.901 --> 00:13:54.378\nYou drive different.\n\n00:13:54.402 --> 00:13:56.574\nYou see that thing. You do. You do.\n\n00:13:56.598 --> 00:13:59.294\nAnd not anesthetized, separated from life.\n\n00:13:59.318 --> 00:14:02.614\nThere's a hole at the front\nand there's a reason for that.\n\n00:14:02.638 --> 00:14:06.054\nIt's a city car.\nYou drive along. You get out.\n\n00:14:06.078 --> 00:14:08.678\nYou drive on to a proboscis.

But if you know anything about the history of Britannica since 1962, it was anything but radical: still a very completely safe, stodgy type of encyclopedia. Wikipedia, on the other hand, begins with a very radical idea, and that's for all of us to imagine a world in which every single person on the planet is given free access to the sum of all human knowledge.And that's what we're doing. So Wikipedia \u2014 you just saw the little demonstration of it \u2014 it's a freely licensed encyclopedia. It's written by thousands of volunteers all over the world in many, many languages. It's written using wiki software \u2014 which is the type of software he just demonstrated \u2014 so anyone can quickly edit and save, and it goes live on the Internet immediately. And everything about Wikipedia is managed by virtually an all-volunteer staff. So when Yochai is talking about new methods of organization, he's exactly describing Wikipedia. And what I'm going to do today is tell you a little bit more about how it really works on the inside.So Wikipedia's owned by the Wikimedia Foundation, which I founded, a nonprofit organization. And our goal, the core aim of the Wikimedia Foundation, is to get a free encyclopedia to every single person on the planet. And so, if you think about what that means, it means a lot more than just building a cool website. We're really interested in all the issues of the digital divide, poverty worldwide, empowering people everywhere to have the information that they need to make good decisions. And so we're going to have to do a lot of work that goes beyond just the Internet. And so that's a big part of why we've chosen the free licensing model, because that empowers local entrepreneurs or anyone who wants to \u2014 they can take our content and do anything they like with it \u2014 you can copy it, redistribute it \u2014 and you can do it commercially or non-commercially.So there's a lot of opportunities that are going to arise around Wikipedia all over the world. We're funded by donations from the public, and one of the more interesting things about that is how little money it actually takes to run Wikipedia. So Yochai showed you the graph of what the cost of a printing press was. And I'm going to tell you what the cost of Wikipedia is. But first, I'll show you how big it is. So we've got over 600,000 articles in English. We've got two million total articles across many, many different languages. The biggest languages are German, Japanese, French \u2014 all the Western-European languages are quite big. But only around one-third of all of our traffic to our web clusters to the English Wikipedia, which is surprising to a lot of people. A lot of people think in a very English-centric way on the Internet, but for us, we're truly global. We're in many, many languages. How popular we've gotten to be \u2014 we're a top-50 website and we're more popular than the New York Times. So this is where we get to Yochai's discussion.This shows the growth of Wikipedia \u2014 we're the blue line there \u2014 and this is the New York Times over there. And what's interesting about this is the New York Times website is a huge, enormous corporate operation with I have no idea how many hundreds of employees. We have exactly one employee, and that employee is our lead software developer. And he's only been our employee since January 2005, all the other growth before that ... So the servers are managed by a ragtag band of volunteers. All the editing is done by volunteers. And the way that we're organized is not like any traditional organization you can imagine. People are always asking, \"Well, who's in charge of this?\" or \"Who does that?\" And the answer is: anybody who wants to pitch in. It's a very unusual and chaotic thing. We've got over 90 servers now in three locations. These are managed by volunteer system administrators who are online. I can go online any time of the day or night and see eight to 10 people waiting for me to ask a question or something, anything about the servers. You could never afford to do this in a company. You could never afford to have a standby crew of people 24 hours a day and do what we're doing at Wikipedia.So we're doing around 1.4 billion page views monthly, so it's really gotten to be a huge thing. And everything is managed by the volunteers. And the total monthly cost for our bandwidth is about 5,000 dollars. And that's essentially our main cost. We could actually do without the employee. We hired Brian because he was working part-time for two years and full-time at Wikipedia, so we actually hired him, so he could get a life and go to the movies sometimes. So the big question when you've got this really chaotic organization is, why isn't it all rubbish? Why is the website as good as it is?First of all, how good is it? Well, it's pretty good. It isn't perfect, but it's much better than you would expect, given our completely chaotic model. So when you saw him make a ridiculous edit to the page about me, you think, \"Oh, this is obviously just going to degenerate into rubbish.\" But when we've seen quality tests \u2014 and there haven't been enough of these yet and I'm really encouraging people to do more, comparing Wikipedia to traditional things \u2014 we win hands down.So a German magazine compared German Wikipedia, which is much, much smaller than English, to Microsoft Encarta and to Brockhaus multimedial, and we won across the board. They hired experts to come and look at articles and compare the quality, and we were very pleased with that result.So a lot of people have heard about the Wikipedia Bush-Kerry controversy. The media has covered this somewhat extensively. It started out with an article in Red Herring. The reporters called me up and they \u2014 I mean, I have to say they spelled my name right, but they really wanted to say the Bush-Kerry election is so contentious, it's tearing apart the Wikipedia community. And so they quote me as saying, \"They're the most contentious in the history of Wikipedia.\" What I actually said is they're not contentious at all. So it's a slight misquote.(Laughter)The articles were edited quite heavily. And it is true that we did have to lock the articles on a couple of occasions. Time magazine recently reported that \"Extreme action sometimes has to be taken, and Wales locked the entries on Kerry and Bush for most of 2004.\" This came after I told the reporter that we had to lock it for \u2014 occasionally a little bit here and there. So the truth in general is that the kinds of controversies that you would probably think we have within the Wikipedia community are not really controversies at all.Articles on controversial topics are edited a lot, but they don't cause much controversy within the community. And the reason for this is that most people understand the need for neutrality. The real struggle is not between the right and the left \u2014 that's where most people assume \u2014 but it's between the party of the thoughtful and the party of the jerks. And no side of the political spectrum has a monopoly on either of those qualities. The actual truth about the specific Bush-Kerry incident is that the Bush-Kerry articles were locked less than one percent of the time in 2004, and it wasn't because they were contentious; it was just because there was routine vandalism \u2014 which happens sometimes even on stage ...(Laughter)Sometimes even reporters have reported to me that they vandalized Wikipedia and were amazed that it was fixed so quickly. And I said \u2014 you know, I always say, please don't do that. That's not a good thing. So how do we do this? How do we manage the quality control? How does it work?So there's a few elements, mostly social policies and some elements of the software. So the biggest and the most important thing is our neutral point of view policy. This is something that I set down, from the very beginning, as a core principle of the community that's completely not debatable. It's a social concept of cooperation, so we don't talk a lot about truth and objectivity. The reason for this is if we say we're only going to write the \"truth\" about some topic, that doesn't do us a damn bit of good of figuring out what to write, because I don't agree with you about what's the truth. But we have this jargon term of neutrality, which has its own long history within the community, which basically says, any time there's a controversial issue, Wikipedia itself should not take a stand on the issue. We should merely report on what reputable parties have said about it. So this neutrality policy is really important for us because it empowers a community that is very diverse to come together and actually get some work done.So we have very diverse contributors in terms of political, religious, cultural backgrounds. By having this firm neutrality policy, which is non-negotiable from the beginning, we ensure that people can work together and that the entries don't become simply a war back and forth between the left and the right. If you engage in that type of behavior, you'll be asked to leave the community.So, real-time peer review. Every single change on the site goes to the \"Recent changes\" page. So as soon as he made his change, it went to the \"Recent changes\" page. That recent changes page was also fed into an IRC channel, which is an Internet chat channel that people are monitoring with various software tools. And people can get RSS feeds \u2014 they can get email notifications of changes. And then users can set up their own personal watch list. So my page is on quite a few volunteers' watch lists, because it is sometimes vandalized. And therefore, what happens is someone will notice the change very quickly, and then they'll just simply revert the change.There's a \"new pages feed,\" for example, so you can go to a certain page of Wikipedia and see every new page as it's created. This is really important because a lot of new pages are just garbage that has to be deleted, you know, \"ASDFASDF.\" But also, that's some of the most interesting and fun things, some of the new articles. People will start an article on some interesting topic, other people will find that intriguing and jump in and help and make it much better.So we do have edits by anonymous users, which is one of the most controversial and intriguing things about Wikipedia. So, Chris was able to do his change \u2014 he didn't have to log in or anything; he just went on the website and made a change. But it turns out that only about 18 percent of all the edits to the website are done by anonymous users. And that's a really important thing to understand: the vast majority of the edits that go on on the website are from a very close-knit community of maybe 600 to 1,000 people who are in constant communication. And we have over 40 IRC channels, 40 mailing lists. All these people know each other. They communicate. We have off-line meetings.These are the people who are doing the bulk of the site, and they are, in a sense, semi-professionals at what they're doing. The standards we set for ourselves are equal to or higher than professional standards of quality. We don't always meet those standards, but that's what we're striving for.And so that tight community is who really cares for the site, and these are some of the smartest people I've ever met. It's my job to say that, but it's actually true. The type of people who were drawn to writing an encyclopedia for fun tend to be pretty smart people.The tools and the software: there's lots of tools that allow us \u2014 allow us, meaning the community \u2014 to self-monitor and to monitor all the work. This is an example of a page history on \"flat Earth,\" and you can see some changes that were made. What's nice about this page is you can immediately take a look at this and see, \"OK, I understand now.\" When somebody goes and looks at \u2014 they see that someone, an anonymous IP number, made an edit to my page. That sounds suspicious. Who is this person? Somebody looks at it \u2014 they can immediately see highlighted in red all of the changes that took place \u2014 to see, OK, well, these words have changed, things like this. So that's one tool that we can use to very quickly monitor the history of a page.Another thing that we do within the community is we leave everything very open-ended. Most of the social rules and the methods of work are left completely open-ended in the software. All of that stuff is just on Wiki pages. And so there's nothing in the software that enforces the rules. The example I've got up here is the Votes for Deletion page. So, I mentioned earlier, people type \"ASDFASDF\" \u2014 it needs to be deleted. Cases like that, the administrators just delete it. There's no reason to have a big argument about it. But you can imagine there's a lot of other areas where the question is, is this notable enough to go in an encyclopedia? Is the information verifiable? Is it a hoax? Is it true? Is it what? So we needed a social method for figuring out the answer to this. And so the method that arose organically within the community is the Votes For Deletion page. And in the particular example we have here, it's a film, \"Twisted Issues,\" and the first person says, \"Now this is supposedly a film. It fails the Google test miserably.\" The Google test is you look in Google and see if it's there, because if something's not even in Google, it probably doesn't exist at all. It's not a perfect rule, but it's a nice starting point for quick research. So somebody says, \"Delete it, please. Delete it \u2014 it's not notable.\" And then somebody says, \"Wait, I found it. I found it in a book, 'Film Threat Video Guide: the 20 Underground Films You Must See.'\" So the next persons says, \"Clean it up.\" Somebody says, \"I've found it on IMDB. Keep, keep, keep.\"And what's interesting about this is that the software is \u2014 these votes are just text typed into a page. This is not really a vote so much as it is a dialogue. Now it is true that at the end of the day, an administrator can go through here and take a look at this and say, \"OK, 18 deletes, two keeps: we'll delete it.\" But in other cases, this could be 18 deletes and two keeps, and we would keep it, because if those last two keeps say, \"Wait a minute. Nobody else saw this but I found it in a book, and I found a link to a page that describes it, and I'm going to clean it up tomorrow, so please don't delete it,\" then it would survive.And it also matters who the people are who are voting. Like I say, it's a tight-knit community. Down here at the bottom, \"Keep, real movie,\" RickK. RickK is a very famous Wikipedian who does an enormous amount of work with vandalism, hoaxes and votes for deletion. His voice carries a lot of weight within the community because he knows what he's doing. So how is all this governed? People really want to know about administrators, things like that. So the Wikipedia governance model, the governance of the community, is a very confusing, but workable mix of consensus \u2014 meaning we try not to vote on the content of articles, because the majority view is not necessarily neutral \u2014 some amount of democracy \u2014 all of the administrators \u2014 these are the people who have the ability to delete pages. That doesn't mean that they have the right to delete pages. They still have to follow all the rules \u2014 but they're elected by the community.Sometimes people \u2014 random trolls on the Internet \u2014 like to accuse me of handpicking the administrators to bias the content of the encyclopedia. I always laugh at this, because I have no idea how they're elected, actually. There's a certain amount of aristocracy. You got a hint of that when I mentioned, like, RickK's voice would carry a lot more weight than someone we don't know.I give this talk sometimes with Angela, who was just re-elected to the board from the community \u2014 to the Board of the Foundation, with more than twice the votes of the person who didn't make it. And I always embarrass her because I say, \"Well, Angela, for example, could get away with doing absolutely anything within Wikipedia, because she's so admired and so powerful.\" But the irony is, of course, that Angela can do this because she's the one person who you know would never, ever break any rules of Wikipedia. And I also like to say she's the only person who actually knows all the rules of Wikipedia, so ... And then there's monarchy, and that's my role on the community, so ...(Laughter)I was describing this in Berlin once, and the next day in the newspaper the headline said, \"I am the Queen of England.\"(Laughter)And that's not exactly what I said, but \u2014(Laughter)the point is my role in the community \u2014 Within the free software world, there's been a long-standing tradition of the \"benevolent dictator\" model. So if you look at most of the major free software projects, they have one single person in charge who everyone agrees is the benevolent dictator. Well, I don't like the term \"benevolent dictator,\" and I don't think that it's my job or my role in the world of ideas to be the dictator of the future of all human knowledge compiled by the world. It just isn't appropriate. But there is a need still for a certain amount of monarchy, a certain amount of \u2014 sometimes we have to make a decision and we don't want to get bogged down too heavily in formal decision-making processes.So as an example of how this can be important: we recently had a situation where a neo-Nazi website discovered Wikipedia, and they said, \"Oh, well, this is horrible, this Jewish conspiracy of a website, and we're going to get certain articles deleted that we don't like. And we see they have a voting process, so we're going to send \u2014 we have 40,000 members and we're going to send them over and they're all going to vote and get these pages deleted.\" Well, they managed to get 18 people to show up. That's neo-Nazi math for you. They always think they've got 40,000 members when they've got 18. But they managed to get 18 people to come and vote in a fairly absurd way to delete a perfectly valid article. Of course, the vote ended up being about 85 to 18, so there was no real danger to our democratic processes. On the other hand, people said, \"But what are we going to do? I mean, this could happen. What if some group gets really seriously organized and comes in and wants to vote?\" Then I said, \"Well, fuck it, we'll just change the rules.\" That's my job in the community: to say we won't allow our openness and freedom to undermine the quality of the content. And so, as long as people trust me in my role, then that's a valid place for me. Of course, because of the free licensing, if I do a bad job, the volunteers are more than happy to take and leave \u2014 I can't tell anyone what to do.So the final point here is that to understand how Wikipedia works, it's important to understand that our wiki model is the way we work, but we are not fanatical web anarchists. In fact, we're very flexible about the social methodology, because ultimately, the passion of the community is for the quality of the work, not necessarily for the process that we use to generate it.Thank you.(Applause)Ben Saunders: Yeah, hi, Ben Saunders. Jimmy, you mentioned impartiality being a key to Wikipedia's success. It strikes me that much of the textbooks that are used to educate our children are inherently biased. Have you found Wikipedia being used by teachers and how do you see Wikipedia changing education?Jimmy Wales: Yeah, so, a lot of teachers are beginning to use Wikipedia. There's a media storyline about Wikipedia, which I think is false. It builds on the storyline of bloggers versus newspapers. And the storyline is, there's this crazy thing, Wikipedia, but academics hate it and teachers hate it. And that turns out to not be true. The last time I got an email from a journalist saying, \"Why do academics hate Wikipedia?\" I sent it from my Harvard email address because I was recently appointed a fellow there. And I said, \"Well, they don't all hate it.\"(Laughter)But I think there's going to be huge impacts. And we actually have a project that I'm personally really excited about, which is the Wikibooks project, which is an effort to create textbooks in all the languages. And that's a much bigger project. It's going to take 20 years or so to come to fruition.But part of that is to fulfill our mission of giving an encyclopedia to every single person on the planet. We don't mean we're going to Spam them with AOL-style CDs. We mean we're going to give them a tool that they can use. And for a lot of people in the world, if I give you an encyclopedia that's written at a university level, it doesn't do you any good without a whole host of literacy materials to build you up to the point where you can actually use it. The Wikibooks project is an effort to do that. And I think that we're going to see \u2014 it may not even come from us; there's all kinds of innovation going on. But freely licensed textbooks are the next big thing in education.", "id": 37, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:12.518 --> 00:00:15.653\nCharles Van Doren, who was later\na senior editor of Britannica,\n\n00:00:15.677 --> 00:00:18.854\nsaid the ideal encyclopedia\nshould be radical --\n\n00:00:18.878 --> 00:00:20.414\nit should stop being safe.\n\n00:00:20.438 --> 00:00:23.654\nBut if you know anything about the history\nof Britannica since 1962,\n\n00:00:23.678 --> 00:00:25.014\nit was anything but radical:\n\n00:00:25.038 --> 00:00:29.934\nstill a very completely safe,\nstodgy type of encyclopedia.\n\n00:00:29.958 --> 00:00:34.134\nWikipedia, on the other hand,\nbegins with a very radical idea,\n\n00:00:34.158 --> 00:00:36.174\nand that's for all of us\nto imagine a world\n\n00:00:36.198 --> 00:00:38.214\nin which every single person on the planet\n\n00:00:38.238 --> 00:00:40.814\nis given free access\nto the sum of all human knowledge.\n\n00:00:40.838 --> 00:00:42.172\nAnd that's what we're doing.\n\n00:00:42.958 --> 00:00:44.117\nSo Wikipedia --\n\n00:00:44.141 --> 00:00:46.574\nyou just saw the little\ndemonstration of it --\n\n00:00:46.598 --> 00:00:48.694\nit's a freely licensed encyclopedia.\n\n00:00:48.718 --> 00:00:50.576\nIt's written by thousands of volunteers\n\n00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:52.600\nall over the world\nin many, many languages.\n\n00:00:53.278 --> 00:00:55.014\nIt's written using wiki software --\n\n00:00:55.038 --> 00:00:57.594\nwhich is the type of software\nhe just demonstrated --\n\n00:00:57.618 --> 00:00:59.333\nso anyone can quickly edit and save,\n\n00:00:59.357 --> 00:01:01.453\nand it goes live\non the Internet immediately.\n\n00:01:02.598 --> 00:01:07.214\nAnd everything about Wikipedia is managed\nby virtually an all-volunteer staff.\n\n00:01:07.238 --> 00:01:11.654\nSo when Yochai is talking\nabout new methods of organization,\n\n00:01:11.678 --> 00:01:14.174\nhe's exactly describing Wikipedia.\n\n00:01:14.198 --> 00:01:15.627\nAnd what I'm going to do today\n\n00:01:15.651 --> 00:01:19.051\nis tell you a little bit more\nabout how it really works on the inside.\n\n00:01:19.918 --> 00:01:23.054\nSo Wikipedia's owned\nby the Wikimedia Foundation,\n\n00:01:23.078 --> 00:01:24.294\nwhich I founded,\n\n00:01:24.318 --> 00:01:25.734\na nonprofit organization.\n\n00:01:25.758 --> 00:01:29.774\nAnd our goal, the core aim\nof the Wikimedia Foundation,\n\n00:01:29.798 --> 00:01:32.974\nis to get a free encyclopedia\nto every single person on the planet.\n\n00:01:32.998 --> 00:01:35.014\nAnd so, if you think\nabout what that means,\n\n00:01:35.038 --> 00:01:37.574\nit means a lot more\nthan just building a cool website.\n\n00:01:37.598 --> 00:01:40.614\nWe're really interested\nin all the issues of the digital divide,\n\n00:01:40.638 --> 00:01:42.214\npoverty worldwide,\n\n00:01:42.238 --> 00:01:45.614\nempowering people everywhere\nto have the information that they need\n\n00:01:45.638 --> 00:01:46.854\nto make good decisions.\n\n00:01:46.878 --> 00:01:49.454\nAnd so we're going\nto have to do a lot of work\n\n00:01:49.478 --> 00:01:51.174\nthat goes beyond just the Internet.\n\n00:01:51.198 --> 00:01:54.494\nAnd so that's a big part of why\nwe've chosen the free licensing model,\n\n00:01:54.518 --> 00:01:57.757\nbecause that empowers local\nentrepreneurs or anyone who wants to --\n\n00:01:57.781 --> 00:02:00.693\nthey can take our content\nand do anything they like with it --\n\n00:02:00.717 --> 00:02:02.399\nyou can copy it, redistribute it --\n\n00:02:02.423 --> 00:02:04.835\nand you can do it\ncommercially or non-commercially.\n\n00:02:04.859 --> 00:02:08.359\nSo there's a lot of opportunities\nthat are going to arise around Wikipedia\n\n00:02:08.383 --> 00:02:09.578\nall over the world.\n\n00:02:10.438 --> 00:02:12.454\nWe're funded by donations from the public,\n\n00:02:12.478 --> 00:02:14.934\nand one of the more\ninteresting things about that\n\n00:02:14.958 --> 00:02:18.774\nis how little money\nit actually takes to run Wikipedia.\n\n00:02:18.798 --> 00:02:23.334\nSo Yochai showed you the graph\nof what the cost of a printing press was.\n\n00:02:23.358 --> 00:02:26.694\nAnd I'm going to tell you\nwhat the cost of Wikipedia is.\n\n00:02:26.718 --> 00:02:28.576\nBut first, I'll show you how big it is.\n\n00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:32.560\nSo we've got over 600,000\narticles in English.\n\n00:02:32.998 --> 00:02:37.454\nWe've got two million total articles\nacross many, many different languages.\n\n00:02:37.478 --> 00:02:40.734\nThe biggest languages\nare German, Japanese, French --\n\n00:02:40.758 --> 00:02:44.454\nall the Western-European\nlanguages are quite big.\n\n00:02:44.478 --> 00:02:47.854\nBut only around one-third\nof all of our traffic to our web\n\n00:02:47.878 --> 00:02:49.514\nclusters to the English Wikipedia,\n\n00:02:49.538 --> 00:02:51.396\nwhich is surprising to a lot of people.\n\n00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:54.774\nA lot of people think in a very\nEnglish-centric way on the Internet,\n\n00:02:54.798 --> 00:02:56.694\nbut for us, we're truly global.\n\n00:02:56.718 --> 00:02:58.291\nWe're in many, many languages.\n\n00:02:58.838 --> 00:03:01.974\nHow popular we've gotten to be --\nwe're a top-50 website\n\n00:03:01.998 --> 00:03:04.189\nand we're more popular\nthan the New York Times.\n\n00:03:04.213 --> 00:03:08.453\nSo this is where we get\nto Yochai's discussion.\n\n00:03:08.918 --> 00:03:12.254\nThis shows the growth of Wikipedia --\nwe're the blue line there --\n\n00:03:12.278 --> 00:03:14.974\nand this is the New York Times over there.\n\n00:03:14.998 --> 00:03:16.574\nAnd what's interesting about this\n\n00:03:16.598 --> 00:03:20.934\nis the New York Times website is a huge,\nenormous corporate operation\n\n00:03:20.958 --> 00:03:23.454\nwith I have no idea\nhow many hundreds of employees.\n\n00:03:23.478 --> 00:03:25.494\nWe have exactly one employee,\n\n00:03:25.518 --> 00:03:28.134\nand that employee\nis our lead software developer.\n\n00:03:28.158 --> 00:03:31.334\nAnd he's only been our employee\nsince January 2005,\n\n00:03:31.358 --> 00:03:33.174\nall the other growth before that ...\n\n00:03:33.198 --> 00:03:36.814\nSo the servers are managed\nby a ragtag band of volunteers.\n\n00:03:36.838 --> 00:03:38.814\nAll the editing is done by volunteers.\n\n00:03:38.838 --> 00:03:40.374\nAnd the way that we're organized\n\n00:03:40.398 --> 00:03:43.081\nis not like any traditional\norganization you can imagine.\n\n00:03:43.105 --> 00:03:45.820\nPeople are always asking,\n\"Well, who's in charge of this?\"\n\n00:03:45.844 --> 00:03:47.014\nor \"Who does that?\"\n\n00:03:47.038 --> 00:03:49.334\nAnd the answer is:\nanybody who wants to pitch in.\n\n00:03:49.358 --> 00:03:52.838\nIt's a very unusual and chaotic thing.\n\n00:03:53.438 --> 00:03:55.734\nWe've got over 90 servers now\nin three locations.\n\n00:03:55.758 --> 00:04:01.014\nThese are managed by volunteer\nsystem administrators who are online.\n\n00:04:01.038 --> 00:04:03.094\nI can go online\nany time of the day or night\n\n00:04:03.118 --> 00:04:07.414\nand see eight to 10 people waiting for me\n\n00:04:07.438 --> 00:04:10.974\nto ask a question or something,\nanything about the servers.\n\n00:04:10.998 --> 00:04:13.334\nYou could never afford\nto do this in a company.\n\n00:04:13.358 --> 00:04:14.574\nYou could never afford\n\n00:04:14.598 --> 00:04:18.334\nto have a standby crew of people\n24 hours a day\n\n00:04:18.358 --> 00:04:20.678\nand do what we're doing at Wikipedia.\n\n00:04:21.438 --> 00:04:24.654\nSo we're doing around\n1.4 billion page views monthly,\n\n00:04:24.678 --> 00:04:26.718\nso it's really gotten to be a huge thing.\n\n00:04:27.318 --> 00:04:29.694\nAnd everything is managed\nby the volunteers.\n\n00:04:29.718 --> 00:04:33.934\nAnd the total monthly cost\nfor our bandwidth is about 5,000 dollars.\n\n00:04:33.958 --> 00:04:35.894\nAnd that's essentially our main cost.\n\n00:04:35.918 --> 00:04:38.174\nWe could actually do without the employee.\n\n00:04:38.198 --> 00:04:42.614\nWe hired Brian because he was\nworking part-time for two years\n\n00:04:42.638 --> 00:04:43.934\nand full-time at Wikipedia,\n\n00:04:43.958 --> 00:04:45.174\nso we actually hired him,\n\n00:04:45.198 --> 00:04:47.838\nso he could get a life\nand go to the movies sometimes.\n\n00:04:48.913 --> 00:04:52.294\nSo the big question when you've got\nthis really chaotic organization is,\n\n00:04:52.318 --> 00:04:53.534\nwhy isn't it all rubbish?\n\n00:04:53.558 --> 00:04:55.478\nWhy is the website as good as it is?\n\n00:04:55.953 --> 00:04:57.334\nFirst of all, how good is it?\n\n00:04:57.358 --> 00:04:58.894\nWell, it's pretty good.\n\n00:04:58.918 --> 00:05:00.134\nIt isn't perfect,\n\n00:05:00.158 --> 00:05:02.174\nbut it's much better\nthan you would expect,\n\n00:05:02.198 --> 00:05:03.881\ngiven our completely chaotic model.\n\n00:05:03.905 --> 00:05:06.921\nSo when you saw him make\na ridiculous edit to the page about me,\n\n00:05:06.945 --> 00:05:10.694\nyou think, \"Oh, this is obviously\njust going to degenerate into rubbish.\"\n\n00:05:10.718 --> 00:05:12.449\nBut when we've seen quality tests --\n\n00:05:12.473 --> 00:05:14.489\nand there haven't been enough of these yet\n\n00:05:14.513 --> 00:05:17.094\nand I'm really encouraging\npeople to do more,\n\n00:05:17.118 --> 00:05:19.254\ncomparing Wikipedia\nto traditional things --\n\n00:05:19.278 --> 00:05:21.054\nwe win hands down.\n\n00:05:21.078 --> 00:05:23.814\nSo a German magazine\ncompared German Wikipedia,\n\n00:05:23.838 --> 00:05:27.174\nwhich is much, much smaller than English,\n\n00:05:27.198 --> 00:05:31.294\nto Microsoft Encarta\nand to Brockhaus multimedial,\n\n00:05:31.318 --> 00:05:32.774\nand we won across the board.\n\n00:05:32.798 --> 00:05:36.179\nThey hired experts to come and look\nat articles and compare the quality,\n\n00:05:36.203 --> 00:05:38.523\nand we were very pleased with that result.\n\n00:05:39.278 --> 00:05:44.814\nSo a lot of people have heard about\nthe Wikipedia Bush-Kerry controversy.\n\n00:05:44.838 --> 00:05:47.494\nThe media has covered this\nsomewhat extensively.\n\n00:05:47.518 --> 00:05:50.334\nIt started out\nwith an article in Red Herring.\n\n00:05:50.358 --> 00:05:52.174\nThe reporters called me up and they --\n\n00:05:52.198 --> 00:05:55.174\nI mean, I have to say\nthey spelled my name right,\n\n00:05:55.198 --> 00:06:00.134\nbut they really wanted to say\nthe Bush-Kerry election is so contentious,\n\n00:06:00.158 --> 00:06:02.534\nit's tearing apart\nthe Wikipedia community.\n\n00:06:02.558 --> 00:06:04.054\nAnd so they quote me as saying,\n\n00:06:04.078 --> 00:06:06.974\n\"They're the most contentious\nin the history of Wikipedia.\"\n\n00:06:06.998 --> 00:06:09.574\nWhat I actually said\nis they're not contentious at all.\n\n00:06:09.598 --> 00:06:11.694\nSo it's a slight misquote.\n\n00:06:11.718 --> 00:06:13.494\n(Laughter)\n\n00:06:13.518 --> 00:06:15.534\nThe articles were edited quite heavily.\n\n00:06:15.558 --> 00:06:18.014\nAnd it is true that we did\nhave to lock the articles\n\n00:06:18.038 --> 00:06:19.374\non a couple of occasions.\n\n00:06:19.398 --> 00:06:21.774\nTime magazine recently reported that\n\n00:06:21.798 --> 00:06:23.814\n\"Extreme action sometimes has to be taken,\n\n00:06:23.838 --> 00:06:28.694\nand Wales locked the entries\non Kerry and Bush for most of 2004.\"\n\n00:06:28.718 --> 00:06:32.974\nThis came after I told the reporter\nthat we had to lock it for --\n\n00:06:32.998 --> 00:06:35.134\noccasionally a little bit here and there.\n\n00:06:35.158 --> 00:06:38.534\nSo the truth in general\nis that the kinds of controversies\n\n00:06:38.558 --> 00:06:41.749\nthat you would probably think\nwe have within the Wikipedia community\n\n00:06:41.773 --> 00:06:44.494\nare not really controversies at all.\n\n00:06:44.518 --> 00:06:47.014\nArticles on controversial topics\nare edited a lot,\n\n00:06:47.038 --> 00:06:50.014\nbut they don't cause much controversy\nwithin the community.\n\n00:06:50.038 --> 00:06:53.758\nAnd the reason for this is that most\npeople understand the need for neutrality.\n\n00:06:54.558 --> 00:07:01.254\nThe real struggle is not\nbetween the right and the left --\n\n00:07:01.278 --> 00:07:02.898\nthat's where most people assume --\n\n00:07:02.922 --> 00:07:04.974\nbut it's between\nthe party of the thoughtful\n\n00:07:04.998 --> 00:07:06.294\nand the party of the jerks.\n\n00:07:06.318 --> 00:07:08.134\nAnd no side of the political spectrum\n\n00:07:08.158 --> 00:07:10.614\nhas a monopoly\non either of those qualities.\n\n00:07:10.638 --> 00:07:13.214\nThe actual truth\nabout the specific Bush-Kerry incident\n\n00:07:13.238 --> 00:07:16.214\nis that the Bush-Kerry articles\n\n00:07:16.238 --> 00:07:19.214\nwere locked less than one percent\nof the time in 2004,\n\n00:07:19.238 --> 00:07:21.294\nand it wasn't because\nthey were contentious;\n\n00:07:21.318 --> 00:07:23.654\nit was just because\nthere was routine vandalism --\n\n00:07:23.678 --> 00:07:27.374\nwhich happens sometimes even on stage ...\n\n00:07:27.398 --> 00:07:28.534\n(Laughter)\n\n00:07:28.558 --> 00:07:32.094\nSometimes even reporters have reported\nto me that they vandalized Wikipedia\n\n00:07:32.118 --> 00:07:34.454\nand were amazed\nthat it was fixed so quickly.\n\n00:07:34.478 --> 00:07:37.254\nAnd I said -- you know, I always say,\nplease don't do that.\n\n00:07:37.278 --> 00:07:38.854\nThat's not a good thing.\n\n00:07:38.878 --> 00:07:40.374\nSo how do we do this?\n\n00:07:40.398 --> 00:07:43.254\nHow do we manage the quality control?\n\n00:07:43.278 --> 00:07:44.478\nHow does it work?\n\n00:07:46.078 --> 00:07:47.774\nSo there's a few elements,\n\n00:07:47.798 --> 00:07:51.054\nmostly social policies\nand some elements of the software.\n\n00:07:51.078 --> 00:07:53.814\nSo the biggest\nand the most important thing\n\n00:07:53.838 --> 00:07:55.569\nis our neutral point of view policy.\n\n00:07:55.593 --> 00:07:58.355\nThis is something\nthat I set down, from the very beginning,\n\n00:07:58.379 --> 00:08:02.414\nas a core principle of the community\nthat's completely not debatable.\n\n00:08:02.438 --> 00:08:05.334\nIt's a social concept of cooperation,\n\n00:08:05.358 --> 00:08:08.854\nso we don't talk a lot\nabout truth and objectivity.\n\n00:08:08.878 --> 00:08:10.934\nThe reason for this is if we say\n\n00:08:10.958 --> 00:08:13.534\nwe're only going to write\nthe \"truth\" about some topic,\n\n00:08:13.558 --> 00:08:16.765\nthat doesn't do us a damn bit of good\nof figuring out what to write,\n\n00:08:16.789 --> 00:08:19.325\nbecause I don't agree with you\nabout what's the truth.\n\n00:08:19.349 --> 00:08:21.694\nBut we have this\njargon term of neutrality,\n\n00:08:21.718 --> 00:08:24.174\nwhich has its own long history\nwithin the community,\n\n00:08:24.198 --> 00:08:27.614\nwhich basically says,\nany time there's a controversial issue,\n\n00:08:27.638 --> 00:08:30.214\nWikipedia itself should not\ntake a stand on the issue.\n\n00:08:30.238 --> 00:08:33.477\nWe should merely report on what\nreputable parties have said about it.\n\n00:08:33.501 --> 00:08:36.574\nSo this neutrality policy\nis really important for us\n\n00:08:36.598 --> 00:08:39.854\nbecause it empowers a community\nthat is very diverse\n\n00:08:39.878 --> 00:08:42.174\nto come together\nand actually get some work done.\n\n00:08:42.198 --> 00:08:44.334\nSo we have very diverse contributors\n\n00:08:44.358 --> 00:08:47.574\nin terms of political,\nreligious, cultural backgrounds.\n\n00:08:47.598 --> 00:08:49.414\nBy having this firm neutrality policy,\n\n00:08:49.438 --> 00:08:51.454\nwhich is non-negotiable\nfrom the beginning,\n\n00:08:51.478 --> 00:08:53.336\nwe ensure that people can work together\n\n00:08:53.360 --> 00:08:55.574\nand that the entries\ndon't become simply a war\n\n00:08:55.598 --> 00:08:57.741\nback and forth\nbetween the left and the right.\n\n00:08:57.765 --> 00:09:01.480\nIf you engage in that type of behavior,\nyou'll be asked to leave the community.\n\n00:09:03.198 --> 00:09:04.654\nSo, real-time peer review.\n\n00:09:04.678 --> 00:09:07.814\nEvery single change on the site\ngoes to the \"Recent changes\" page.\n\n00:09:07.838 --> 00:09:11.334\nSo as soon as he made his change,\nit went to the \"Recent changes\" page.\n\n00:09:11.358 --> 00:09:15.334\nThat recent changes page\nwas also fed into an IRC channel,\n\n00:09:15.358 --> 00:09:16.934\nwhich is an Internet chat channel\n\n00:09:16.958 --> 00:09:20.158\nthat people are monitoring\nwith various software tools.\n\n00:09:20.878 --> 00:09:23.334\nAnd people can get RSS feeds --\n\n00:09:23.358 --> 00:09:26.454\nthey can get email\nnotifications of changes.\n\n00:09:26.478 --> 00:09:29.134\nAnd then users can set up\ntheir own personal watch list.\n\n00:09:29.158 --> 00:09:31.651\nSo my page is on quite a few\nvolunteers' watch lists,\n\n00:09:31.675 --> 00:09:33.371\nbecause it is sometimes vandalized.\n\n00:09:33.395 --> 00:09:39.374\nAnd therefore, what happens is someone\nwill notice the change very quickly,\n\n00:09:39.398 --> 00:09:42.774\nand then they'll just\nsimply revert the change.\n\n00:09:42.798 --> 00:09:44.714\nThere's a \"new pages feed,\" for example,\n\n00:09:44.738 --> 00:09:46.794\nso you can go\nto a certain page of Wikipedia\n\n00:09:46.818 --> 00:09:48.746\nand see every new page as it's created.\n\n00:09:48.778 --> 00:09:49.928\nThis is really important\n\n00:09:49.938 --> 00:09:53.154\nbecause a lot of new pages\nare just garbage that has to be deleted,\n\n00:09:53.158 --> 00:09:54.414\nyou know, \"ASDFASDF.\"\n\n00:09:54.438 --> 00:09:57.354\nBut also, that's some\nof the most interesting and fun things,\n\n00:09:57.378 --> 00:09:58.594\nsome of the new articles.\n\n00:09:58.618 --> 00:10:01.194\nPeople will start an article\non some interesting topic,\n\n00:10:01.218 --> 00:10:03.034\nother people will find that intriguing\n\n00:10:03.058 --> 00:10:05.454\nand jump in and help\nand make it much better.\n\n00:10:05.478 --> 00:10:07.374\nSo we do have edits by anonymous users,\n\n00:10:07.398 --> 00:10:11.254\nwhich is one of the most controversial\nand intriguing things about Wikipedia.\n\n00:10:11.278 --> 00:10:14.894\nSo, Chris was able to do his change --\nhe didn't have to log in or anything;\n\n00:10:14.918 --> 00:10:17.734\nhe just went on the website\nand made a change.\n\n00:10:17.758 --> 00:10:19.814\nBut it turns out\nthat only about 18 percent\n\n00:10:19.838 --> 00:10:21.334\nof all the edits to the website\n\n00:10:21.358 --> 00:10:22.694\nare done by anonymous users.\n\n00:10:22.718 --> 00:10:25.054\nAnd that's a really important\nthing to understand:\n\n00:10:25.078 --> 00:10:28.334\nthe vast majority of the edits\nthat go on on the website\n\n00:10:28.358 --> 00:10:32.054\nare from a very close-knit community\nof maybe 600 to 1,000 people\n\n00:10:32.078 --> 00:10:33.698\nwho are in constant communication.\n\n00:10:33.722 --> 00:10:36.294\nAnd we have over 40 IRC channels,\n40 mailing lists.\n\n00:10:36.318 --> 00:10:37.894\nAll these people know each other.\n\n00:10:37.918 --> 00:10:39.966\nThey communicate.\nWe have off-line meetings.\n\n00:10:39.990 --> 00:10:42.610\nThese are the people\nwho are doing the bulk of the site,\n\n00:10:42.634 --> 00:10:47.282\nand they are, in a sense,\nsemi-professionals at what they're doing.\n\n00:10:47.918 --> 00:10:50.254\nThe standards we set for ourselves\n\n00:10:50.278 --> 00:10:53.334\nare equal to or higher\nthan professional standards of quality.\n\n00:10:53.358 --> 00:10:56.874\nWe don't always meet those standards,\nbut that's what we're striving for.\n\n00:10:56.898 --> 00:10:59.756\nAnd so that tight community\nis who really cares for the site,\n\n00:10:59.780 --> 00:11:02.414\nand these are some\nof the smartest people I've ever met.\n\n00:11:02.438 --> 00:11:04.694\nIt's my job to say that,\nbut it's actually true.\n\n00:11:04.718 --> 00:11:08.454\nThe type of people who were drawn\nto writing an encyclopedia for fun\n\n00:11:08.478 --> 00:11:10.814\ntend to be pretty smart people.\n\n00:11:10.838 --> 00:11:13.934\nThe tools and the software:\nthere's lots of tools that allow us --\n\n00:11:13.958 --> 00:11:15.578\nallow us, meaning the community --\n\n00:11:15.602 --> 00:11:17.654\nto self-monitor\nand to monitor all the work.\n\n00:11:17.678 --> 00:11:20.174\nThis is an example\nof a page history on \"flat Earth,\"\n\n00:11:20.198 --> 00:11:22.254\nand you can see some changes\nthat were made.\n\n00:11:22.278 --> 00:11:25.574\nWhat's nice about this page\nis you can immediately take a look at this\n\n00:11:25.598 --> 00:11:27.174\nand see, \"OK, I understand now.\"\n\n00:11:27.198 --> 00:11:28.974\nWhen somebody goes and looks at --\n\n00:11:28.998 --> 00:11:31.141\nthey see that someone,\nan anonymous IP number,\n\n00:11:31.165 --> 00:11:32.654\nmade an edit to my page.\n\n00:11:32.678 --> 00:11:34.734\nThat sounds suspicious.\nWho is this person?\n\n00:11:34.758 --> 00:11:35.974\nSomebody looks at it --\n\n00:11:35.998 --> 00:11:38.014\nthey can immediately see\nhighlighted in red\n\n00:11:38.038 --> 00:11:39.934\nall of the changes that took place --\n\n00:11:39.958 --> 00:11:43.574\nto see, OK, well, these words\nhave changed, things like this.\n\n00:11:43.598 --> 00:11:45.218\nSo that's one tool that we can use\n\n00:11:45.242 --> 00:11:47.762\nto very quickly monitor\nthe history of a page.\n\n00:11:48.478 --> 00:11:50.774\nAnother thing that we do\nwithin the community\n\n00:11:50.798 --> 00:11:54.174\nis we leave everything very open-ended.\n\n00:11:54.198 --> 00:11:57.574\nMost of the social rules\nand the methods of work\n\n00:11:57.598 --> 00:12:00.014\nare left completely open-ended\nin the software.\n\n00:12:00.038 --> 00:12:02.054\nAll of that stuff is just on Wiki pages.\n\n00:12:02.078 --> 00:12:05.174\nAnd so there's nothing\nin the software that enforces the rules.\n\n00:12:05.198 --> 00:12:09.214\nThe example I've got up here\nis the Votes for Deletion page.\n\n00:12:09.238 --> 00:12:11.814\nSo, I mentioned earlier,\npeople type \"ASDFASDF\" --\n\n00:12:11.838 --> 00:12:13.054\nit needs to be deleted.\n\n00:12:13.078 --> 00:12:15.554\nCases like that,\nthe administrators just delete it.\n\n00:12:15.578 --> 00:12:17.914\nThere's no reason\nto have a big argument about it.\n\n00:12:17.938 --> 00:12:21.273\nBut you can imagine there's a lot\nof other areas where the question is,\n\n00:12:21.297 --> 00:12:23.537\nis this notable enough\nto go in an encyclopedia?\n\n00:12:23.561 --> 00:12:27.134\nIs the information verifiable?\nIs it a hoax? Is it true? Is it what?\n\n00:12:27.158 --> 00:12:30.214\nSo we needed a social method\nfor figuring out the answer to this.\n\n00:12:30.238 --> 00:12:33.096\nAnd so the method that arose\norganically within the community\n\n00:12:33.120 --> 00:12:34.694\nis the Votes For Deletion page.\n\n00:12:34.718 --> 00:12:36.734\nAnd in the particular\nexample we have here,\n\n00:12:36.758 --> 00:12:38.254\nit's a film, \"Twisted Issues,\"\n\n00:12:38.278 --> 00:12:39.734\nand the first person says,\n\n00:12:39.758 --> 00:12:43.454\n\"Now this is supposedly a film.\nIt fails the Google test miserably.\"\n\n00:12:43.478 --> 00:12:46.294\nThe Google test is you look in Google\nand see if it's there,\n\n00:12:46.318 --> 00:12:50.214\nbecause if something's not even in Google,\nit probably doesn't exist at all.\n\n00:12:50.238 --> 00:12:51.814\nIt's not a perfect rule,\n\n00:12:51.838 --> 00:12:55.174\nbut it's a nice starting point\nfor quick research.\n\n00:12:55.198 --> 00:12:58.453\nSo somebody says, \"Delete it, please.\nDelete it -- it's not notable.\"\n\n00:12:58.477 --> 00:13:01.493\nAnd then somebody says,\n\"Wait, I found it. I found it in a book,\n\n00:13:01.517 --> 00:13:04.774\n'Film Threat Video Guide:\nthe 20 Underground Films You Must See.'\"\n\n00:13:04.798 --> 00:13:06.703\nSo the next persons says, \"Clean it up.\"\n\n00:13:06.727 --> 00:13:10.134\nSomebody says, \"I've found it on IMDB.\nKeep, keep, keep.\"\n\n00:13:10.158 --> 00:13:12.974\nAnd what's interesting about this\nis that the software is --\n\n00:13:12.998 --> 00:13:16.534\nthese votes are just text\ntyped into a page.\n\n00:13:16.558 --> 00:13:20.614\nThis is not really a vote\nso much as it is a dialogue.\n\n00:13:20.638 --> 00:13:23.374\nNow it is true that at the end of the day,\n\n00:13:23.398 --> 00:13:26.637\nan administrator can go through here\nand take a look at this and say,\n\n00:13:26.661 --> 00:13:29.134\n\"OK, 18 deletes, two keeps:\nwe'll delete it.\"\n\n00:13:29.158 --> 00:13:32.934\nBut in other cases,\nthis could be 18 deletes and two keeps,\n\n00:13:32.958 --> 00:13:35.754\nand we would keep it,\nbecause if those last two keeps say,\n\n00:13:35.778 --> 00:13:38.683\n\"Wait a minute. Nobody else saw this\nbut I found it in a book,\n\n00:13:38.707 --> 00:13:40.905\nand I found a link\nto a page that describes it,\n\n00:13:40.929 --> 00:13:44.025\nand I'm going to clean it up tomorrow,\nso please don't delete it,\"\n\n00:13:44.049 --> 00:13:45.234\nthen it would survive.\n\n00:13:45.258 --> 00:13:47.854\nAnd it also matters\nwho the people are who are voting.\n\n00:13:47.878 --> 00:13:49.783\nLike I say, it's a tight-knit community.\n\n00:13:49.807 --> 00:13:52.334\nDown here at the bottom,\n\"Keep, real movie,\" RickK.\n\n00:13:52.358 --> 00:13:55.739\nRickK is a very famous Wikipedian\nwho does an enormous amount of work\n\n00:13:55.763 --> 00:13:58.494\nwith vandalism, hoaxes\nand votes for deletion.\n\n00:13:58.518 --> 00:14:01.334\nHis voice carries a lot of weight\nwithin the community\n\n00:14:01.358 --> 00:14:02.930\nbecause he knows what he's doing.\n\n00:14:04.358 --> 00:14:06.294\nSo how is all this governed?\n\n00:14:06.318 --> 00:14:09.454\nPeople really want to know\nabout administrators, things like that.\n\n00:14:09.478 --> 00:14:13.334\nSo the Wikipedia governance model,\nthe governance of the community,\n\n00:14:13.358 --> 00:14:17.774\nis a very confusing,\nbut workable mix of consensus --\n\n00:14:17.798 --> 00:14:20.334\nmeaning we try not to vote\non the content of articles,\n\n00:14:20.358 --> 00:14:24.254\nbecause the majority view\nis not necessarily neutral --\n\n00:14:24.278 --> 00:14:25.574\nsome amount of democracy --\n\n00:14:25.598 --> 00:14:26.934\nall of the administrators --\n\n00:14:26.958 --> 00:14:29.754\nthese are the people\nwho have the ability to delete pages.\n\n00:14:29.778 --> 00:14:32.614\nThat doesn't mean that they have\nthe right to delete pages.\n\n00:14:32.638 --> 00:14:36.474\nThey still have to follow all the rules --\nbut they're elected by the community.\n\n00:14:36.498 --> 00:14:38.928\nSometimes people --\nrandom trolls on the Internet --\n\n00:14:38.952 --> 00:14:41.335\nlike to accuse me\nof handpicking the administrators\n\n00:14:41.359 --> 00:14:43.264\nto bias the content of the encyclopedia.\n\n00:14:43.288 --> 00:14:47.054\nI always laugh at this, because I have\nno idea how they're elected, actually.\n\n00:14:47.078 --> 00:14:49.054\nThere's a certain amount of aristocracy.\n\n00:14:49.078 --> 00:14:51.221\nYou got a hint of that\nwhen I mentioned, like,\n\n00:14:51.245 --> 00:14:53.397\nRickK's voice would carry\na lot more weight\n\n00:14:53.421 --> 00:14:54.717\nthan someone we don't know.\n\n00:14:54.741 --> 00:14:57.454\nI give this talk sometimes with Angela,\n\n00:14:57.478 --> 00:15:00.209\nwho was just re-elected to the board\nfrom the community --\n\n00:15:00.233 --> 00:15:01.729\nto the Board of the Foundation,\n\n00:15:01.753 --> 00:15:04.894\nwith more than twice the votes\nof the person who didn't make it.\n\n00:15:04.918 --> 00:15:07.854\nAnd I always embarrass her because I say,\n\n00:15:07.878 --> 00:15:09.174\n\"Well, Angela, for example,\n\n00:15:09.198 --> 00:15:12.614\ncould get away with doing\nabsolutely anything within Wikipedia,\n\n00:15:12.638 --> 00:15:14.654\nbecause she's so admired and so powerful.\"\n\n00:15:14.678 --> 00:15:18.494\nBut the irony is, of course, that Angela\ncan do this because she's the one person\n\n00:15:18.518 --> 00:15:21.494\nwho you know would never, ever\nbreak any rules of Wikipedia.\n\n00:15:21.518 --> 00:15:23.574\nAnd I also like to say\nshe's the only person\n\n00:15:23.598 --> 00:15:26.814\nwho actually knows\nall the rules of Wikipedia, so ...\n\n00:15:26.838 --> 00:15:28.077\nAnd then there's monarchy,\n\n00:15:28.101 --> 00:15:30.117\nand that's my role\non the community, so ...\n\n00:15:30.141 --> 00:15:32.534\n(Laughter)\n\n00:15:32.558 --> 00:15:35.174\nI was describing this in Berlin once,\n\n00:15:35.198 --> 00:15:37.974\nand the next day\nin the newspaper the headline said,\n\n00:15:37.998 --> 00:15:39.566\n\"I am the Queen of England.\"\n\n00:15:39.590 --> 00:15:40.741\n(Laughter)\n\n00:15:40.765 --> 00:15:43.134\nAnd that's not exactly what I said, but --\n\n00:15:43.158 --> 00:15:44.654\n(Laughter)\n\n00:15:44.678 --> 00:15:47.254\nthe point is my role in the community --\n\n00:15:47.278 --> 00:15:51.974\nWithin the free software world,\nthere's been a long-standing tradition\n\n00:15:51.998 --> 00:15:55.214\nof the \"benevolent dictator\" model.\n\n00:15:55.238 --> 00:15:58.094\nSo if you look at most\nof the major free software projects,\n\n00:15:58.118 --> 00:15:59.894\nthey have one single person in charge\n\n00:15:59.918 --> 00:16:03.254\nwho everyone agrees\nis the benevolent dictator.\n\n00:16:03.278 --> 00:16:05.774\nWell, I don't like the term\n\"benevolent dictator,\"\n\n00:16:05.798 --> 00:16:09.774\nand I don't think that it's my job\nor my role in the world of ideas\n\n00:16:09.798 --> 00:16:13.134\nto be the dictator of the future\nof all human knowledge\n\n00:16:13.158 --> 00:16:14.374\ncompiled by the world.\n\n00:16:14.398 --> 00:16:16.094\nIt just isn't appropriate.\n\n00:16:16.118 --> 00:16:18.894\nBut there is a need still\nfor a certain amount of monarchy,\n\n00:16:18.918 --> 00:16:20.494\na certain amount of --\n\n00:16:20.518 --> 00:16:22.294\nsometimes we have to make a decision\n\n00:16:22.318 --> 00:16:24.557\nand we don't want\nto get bogged down too heavily\n\n00:16:24.581 --> 00:16:27.294\nin formal decision-making processes.\n\n00:16:27.318 --> 00:16:32.214\nSo as an example\nof how this can be important:\n\n00:16:32.238 --> 00:16:36.214\nwe recently had a situation where\na neo-Nazi website discovered Wikipedia,\n\n00:16:36.238 --> 00:16:39.094\nand they said,\n\"Oh, well, this is horrible,\n\n00:16:39.118 --> 00:16:41.014\nthis Jewish conspiracy of a website,\n\n00:16:41.038 --> 00:16:44.197\nand we're going to get certain articles\ndeleted that we don't like.\n\n00:16:44.221 --> 00:16:47.221\nAnd we see they have a voting process,\nso we're going to send --\n\n00:16:47.245 --> 00:16:50.054\nwe have 40,000 members\nand we're going to send them over\n\n00:16:50.078 --> 00:16:52.856\nand they're all going to vote\nand get these pages deleted.\"\n\n00:16:52.880 --> 00:16:55.071\nWell, they managed\nto get 18 people to show up.\n\n00:16:55.095 --> 00:16:57.854\nThat's neo-Nazi math for you.\n\n00:16:57.878 --> 00:17:01.334\nThey always think they've got\n40,000 members when they've got 18.\n\n00:17:01.358 --> 00:17:04.854\nBut they managed to get 18 people\nto come and vote in a fairly absurd way\n\n00:17:04.878 --> 00:17:06.894\nto delete a perfectly valid article.\n\n00:17:06.918 --> 00:17:09.654\nOf course, the vote ended up\nbeing about 85 to 18,\n\n00:17:09.678 --> 00:17:12.934\nso there was no real danger\nto our democratic processes.\n\n00:17:12.958 --> 00:17:16.253\nOn the other hand, people said,\n\"But what are we going to do?\n\n00:17:16.277 --> 00:17:17.533\nI mean, this could happen.\n\n00:17:17.557 --> 00:17:19.894\nWhat if some group\ngets really seriously organized\n\n00:17:19.918 --> 00:17:22.494\nand comes in and wants to vote?\"\n\n00:17:22.518 --> 00:17:25.293\nThen I said, \"Well, fuck it,\nwe'll just change the rules.\"\n\n00:17:25.317 --> 00:17:27.013\nThat's my job in the community:\n\n00:17:27.037 --> 00:17:30.614\nto say we won't allow\nour openness and freedom\n\n00:17:30.638 --> 00:17:33.214\nto undermine the quality of the content.\n\n00:17:33.238 --> 00:17:36.533\nAnd so, as long as people\ntrust me in my role,\n\n00:17:36.557 --> 00:17:38.414\nthen that's a valid place for me.\n\n00:17:38.438 --> 00:17:40.474\nOf course, because of the free licensing,\n\n00:17:40.498 --> 00:17:43.975\nif I do a bad job, the volunteers\nare more than happy to take and leave --\n\n00:17:43.999 --> 00:17:45.479\nI can't tell anyone what to do.\n\n00:17:45.958 --> 00:17:50.654\nSo the final point here\nis that to understand how Wikipedia works,\n\n00:17:50.678 --> 00:17:53.869\nit's important to understand\nthat our wiki model is the way we work,\n\n00:17:53.893 --> 00:17:57.494\nbut we are not fanatical web anarchists.\n\n00:17:57.518 --> 00:18:00.894\nIn fact, we're very flexible\nabout the social methodology,\n\n00:18:00.918 --> 00:18:03.334\nbecause ultimately,\nthe passion of the community\n\n00:18:03.358 --> 00:18:05.374\nis for the quality of the work,\n\n00:18:05.398 --> 00:18:08.374\nnot necessarily for the process\nthat we use to generate it.\n\n00:18:08.398 --> 00:18:09.614\nThank you.\n\n00:18:09.638 --> 00:18:13.894\n(Applause)\n\n00:18:13.918 --> 00:18:15.694\nBen Saunders: Yeah, hi, Ben Saunders.\n\n00:18:15.718 --> 00:18:19.854\nJimmy, you mentioned impartiality\nbeing a key to Wikipedia's success.\n\n00:18:19.878 --> 00:18:25.214\nIt strikes me that much of the textbooks\nthat are used to educate our children\n\n00:18:25.238 --> 00:18:27.014\nare inherently biased.\n\n00:18:27.038 --> 00:18:30.654\nHave you found Wikipedia\nbeing used by teachers\n\n00:18:30.678 --> 00:18:33.134\nand how do you see Wikipedia\nchanging education?\n\n00:18:33.158 --> 00:18:37.374\nJimmy Wales: Yeah, so, a lot of teachers\nare beginning to use Wikipedia.\n\n00:18:37.398 --> 00:18:41.974\nThere's a media storyline about Wikipedia,\nwhich I think is false.\n\n00:18:41.998 --> 00:18:45.574\nIt builds on the storyline\nof bloggers versus newspapers.\n\n00:18:45.598 --> 00:18:48.734\nAnd the storyline is,\nthere's this crazy thing, Wikipedia,\n\n00:18:48.758 --> 00:18:52.214\nbut academics hate it\nand teachers hate it.\n\n00:18:52.238 --> 00:18:54.814\nAnd that turns out to not be true.\n\n00:18:54.838 --> 00:18:57.374\nThe last time I got an email\nfrom a journalist saying,\n\n00:18:57.398 --> 00:18:59.114\n\"Why do academics hate Wikipedia?\"\n\n00:18:59.138 --> 00:19:00.996\nI sent it from my Harvard email address\n\n00:19:01.020 --> 00:19:03.273\nbecause I was recently\nappointed a fellow there.\n\n00:19:03.297 --> 00:19:05.313\nAnd I said, \"Well,\nthey don't all hate it.\"\n\n00:19:05.337 --> 00:19:06.414\n(Laughter)\n\n00:19:06.438 --> 00:19:09.294\nBut I think there's going\nto be huge impacts.\n\n00:19:09.318 --> 00:19:12.734\nAnd we actually have a project\nthat I'm personally really excited about,\n\n00:19:12.758 --> 00:19:14.254\nwhich is the Wikibooks project,\n\n00:19:14.278 --> 00:19:17.374\nwhich is an effort to create\ntextbooks in all the languages.\n\n00:19:17.398 --> 00:19:18.974\nAnd that's a much bigger project.\n\n00:19:18.998 --> 00:19:23.614\nIt's going to take 20 years or so\nto come to fruition.\n\n00:19:23.638 --> 00:19:25.654\nBut part of that is to fulfill our mission\n\n00:19:25.678 --> 00:19:28.654\nof giving an encyclopedia\nto every single person on the planet.\n\n00:19:28.678 --> 00:19:31.534\nWe don't mean we're going\nto Spam them with AOL-style CDs.\n\n00:19:31.558 --> 00:19:34.354\nWe mean we're going to give them\na tool that they can use.\n\n00:19:34.378 --> 00:19:36.154\nAnd for a lot of people in the world,\n\n00:19:36.178 --> 00:19:39.354\nif I give you an encyclopedia\nthat's written at a university level,\n\n00:19:39.378 --> 00:19:42.934\nit doesn't do you any good\nwithout a whole host of literacy materials\n\n00:19:42.958 --> 00:19:45.734\nto build you up to the point\nwhere you can actually use it.\n\n00:19:45.758 --> 00:19:47.901\nThe Wikibooks project\nis an effort to do that.\n\n00:19:47.925 --> 00:19:51.134\nAnd I think that we're going to see --\nit may not even come from us;\n\n00:19:51.158 --> 00:19:53.134\nthere's all kinds of innovation going on.\n\n00:19:53.158 --> 00:19:56.318\nBut freely licensed textbooks\nare the next big thing in education."}]

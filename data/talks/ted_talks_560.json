Two years ago, I stood on the TED stage in Arusha, Tanzania. I spoke very briefly about one of my proudest creations. It was a simple machine that changed my life.Before that time, I had never been away from my home in Malawi. I had never used a computer. I had never seen an Internet. On the stage that day, I was so nervous. My English lost, I wanted to vomit. (Laughter) I had never been surrounded by so many azungu, white people. (Laughter)There was a story I wouldn't tell you then. But well, I'm feeling good right now. I would like to share that story today. We have seven children in my family. All sisters, excepting me. This is me with my dad when I was a little boy. Before I discovered the wonders of science, I was just a simple farmer in a country of poor farmers. Like everyone else, we grew maize.One year our fortune turned very bad. In 2001 we experienced an awful famine. Within five months all Malawians began to starve to death. My family ate one meal per day, at night. Only three swallows of nsima for each one of us. The food passes through our bodies. We drop down to nothing.In Malawi, the secondary school, you have to pay school fees. Because of the hunger, I was forced to drop out of school. I looked at my father and looked at those dry fields. It was the future I couldn't accept.I felt very happy to be at the secondary school, so I was determined to do anything possible to receive education. So I went to a library. I read books, science books, especially physics. I couldn't read English that well. I used diagrams and pictures to learn the words around them.Another book put that knowledge in my hands. It said a windmill could pump water and generate electricity. Pump water meant irrigation, a defense against hunger, which we were experiencing by that time. So I decided I would build one windmill for myself. But I didn't have materials to use, so I went to a scrap yard where I found my materials. Many people, including my mother, said I was crazy. (Laughter)I found a tractor fan, shock absorber, PVC pipes. Using a bicycle frame and an old bicycle dynamo, I built my machine. It was one light at first. And then four lights, with switches, and even a circuit breaker, modeled after an electric bell. Another machine pumps water for irrigation.Queues of people start lining up at my house (Laughter) to charge their mobile phone. (Applause) I could not get rid of them. (Laughter) And the reporters came too, which lead to bloggers and which lead to a call from something called TED. I had never seen an airplane before. I had never slept in a hotel. So, on stage that day in Arusha, my English lost, I said something like, \"I tried. And I made it.\"So I would like to say something to all the people out there like me to the Africans, and the poor who are struggling with your dreams. God bless. Maybe one day you will watch this on the Internet. I say to you, trust yourself and believe. Whatever happens, don't give up. Thank you.

It involves a campaign of letter writing, research and phone calls to access my subjects, which can range from Hamas leaders in Gaza to a hibernating black bear in its cave in West Virginia. And oddly, the most notable letter of rejection I ever received came from Walt Disney World, a seemingly innocuous site.And it read \u2014 I'm just going to read a key sentence: \"Especially during these violent times, I personally believe that the magical spell cast upon guests who visit our theme parks is particularly important to protect and helps to provide them with an important fantasy they can escape to.\"Photography threatens fantasy. They didn't want to let my camera in because it confronts constructed realities, myths and beliefs, and provides what appears to be evidence of a truth. But there are multiple truths attached to every image, depending on the creator's intention, the viewer and the context in which it is presented.Over a five year period following September 11th, when the American media and government were seeking hidden and unknown sites beyond its borders, most notably weapons of mass destruction, I chose to look inward at that which was integral to America's foundation, mythology and daily functioning. I wanted to confront the boundaries of the citizen, self-imposed and real, and confront the divide between privileged and public access to knowledge.It was a critical moment in American history and global history where one felt they didn't have access to accurate information. And I wanted to see the center with my own eyes, but what I came away with is a photograph. And it's just another place from which to observe, and the understanding that there are no absolute, all-knowing insiders. And the outsider can never really reach the core.I'm going to run through some of the photographs in this series. It's titled, \"An American Index of the Hidden and Unfamiliar,\" and it's comprised of nearly 70 images. In this context I'll just show you a few. This is a nuclear waste storage and encapsulation facility at Hanford site in Washington State, where there are over 1,900 stainless steel capsules containing nuclear waste submerged in water. A human standing in front of an unprotected capsule would die instantly. And I found one section amongst all of these that actually resembled the outline of the United States of America, which you can see here.And a big part of the work that is sort of absent in this context is text. So I create these two poles. Every image is accompanied with a very detailed factual text. And what I'm most interested in is the invisible space between a text and its accompanying image, and how the image is transformed by the text and the text by the image. So, at best, the image is meant to float away into abstraction and multiple truths and fantasy. And then the text functions as this cruel anchor that kind of nails it to the ground. But in this context I'm just going to read an abridged version of those texts.This is a cryopreservation unit, and it holds the bodies of the wife and mother of cryonics pioneer Robert Ettinger, who hoped to be awoken one day to extended life in good health, with advancements in science and technology, all for the cost of 35 thousand dollars, for forever.This is a 21-year-old Palestinian woman undergoing hymenoplasty. Hymenoplasty is a surgical procedure which restores the virginal state, allowing her to adhere to certain cultural expectations regarding virginity and marriage. So it essentially reconstructs a ruptured hymen, allowing her to bleed upon having sexual intercourse, to simulate the loss of virginity.This is a jury simulation deliberation room, and you can see beyond that two-way mirror jury advisers standing in a room behind the mirror. And they observe deliberations after mock trial proceedings so that they can better advise their clients how to adjust their trial strategy to have the outcome that they're hoping for. This process costs 60,000 dollars.This is a U.S. Customs and Border Protection room, a contraband room, at John F. Kennedy International Airport. On that table you can see 48 hours' worth of seized goods from passengers entering in to the United States. There is a pig's head and African cane rats. And part of my photographic work is I'm not just documenting what's there. I do take certain liberties and intervene. And in this I really wanted it to resemble an early still-life painting, so I spent some time with the smells and items.This is the exhibited art on the walls of the CIA in Langley, Virginia, their original headquarters building. And the CIA has had a long history with both covert and public cultural diplomacy efforts. And it's speculated that some of their interest in the arts was designed to counter Soviet communism and promote what it considered to be pro-American thoughts and aesthetics. And one of the art forms that elicited the interest of the agency, and had thus come under question, is abstract expressionism.This is the Forensic Anthropology Research Facility, and on a six acre plot there are approximately 75 cadavers at any given time that are being studied by forensic anthropologists and researchers who are interested in monitoring a rate of corpse decomposition. And in this particular photograph the body of a young boy has been used to reenact a crime scene.This is the only federally funded site where it is legal to cultivate cannabis for scientific research in the United States. It's a research crop marijuana grow room.And part of the work that I hope for is that there is a sort of disorienting entropy where you can't find any discernible formula in how these things \u2014 they sort of awkwardly jump from government to science to religion to security \u2014 and you can't completely understand how information is being distributed.These are transatlantic submarine communication cables that travel across the floor of the Atlantic Ocean, connecting North America to Europe. They carry over 60 million simultaneous voice conversations, and in a lot of the government and technology sites there was just this very apparent vulnerability. This one is almost humorous because it feels like I could just snip all of that conversation in one easy cut. But stuff did feel like it could have been taken 30 or 40 years ago, like it was locked in the Cold War era and hadn't necessarily progressed.This is a Braille edition of Playboy magazine. (Laughter) And this is ... a division of the Library of Congress produces a free national library service for the blind and visually impaired, and the publications they choose to publish are based on reader popularity. And Playboy is always in the top few. (Laughter) But you'd be surprised, they don't do the photographs. It's just the text. (Laughter)This is an avian quarantine facility where all imported birds coming into America are required to undergo a 30-day quarantine, where they are tested for diseases including Exotic Newcastle Disease and Avian Influenza. This film shows the testing of a new explosive fill on a warhead. And the Air Armament Center at Eglin Air Force Base in Florida is responsible for the deployment and testing of all air-delivered weaponry coming from the United States. And the film was shot on 72 millimeter, government-issue film. And that red dot is a marking on the government-issue film.All living white tigers in North America are the result of selective inbreeding \u2014 that would be mother to son, father to daughter, sister to brother \u2014 to allow for the genetic conditions that create a salable white tiger. Meaning white fur, ice blue eyes, a pink nose. And the majority of these white tigers are not born in a salable state and are killed at birth. It's a very violent process that is little known. And the white tiger is obviously celebrated in several forms of entertainment. Kenny was born. He actually made it to adulthood. He has since passed away, but was mentally retarded and suffers from severe bone abnormalities.This, on a lighter note, is at George Lucas' personal archive. This is the Death Star. And it's shown here in its true orientation. In the context of \"Star Wars: Return of the Jedi,\" its mirror image is presented. They flip the negative. And you can see the photoetched brass detailing, and the painted acrylic facade. In the context of the film, this is a deep-space battle station of the Galactic Empire, capable of annihilating planets and civilizations, and in reality it measures about four feet by two feet. (Laughter)This is at Fort Campbell in Kentucky. It's a Military Operations on Urbanized Terrain site. Essentially they've simulated a city for urban combat, and this is one of the structures that exists in that city. It's called the World Church of God. It's supposed to be a generic site of worship. And after I took this photograph, they constructed a wall around the World Church of God to mimic the set-up of mosques in Afghanistan or Iraq. And I worked with Mehta Vihar who creates virtual simulations for the army for tactical practice. And we put that wall around the World Church of God, and also used the characters and vehicles and explosions that are offered in the video games for the army. And I put them into my photograph.This is live HIV virus at Harvard Medical School, who is working with the U.S. Government to develop sterilizing immunity.And Alhurra is a U.S. Government- sponsored Arabic language television network that distributes news and information to over 22 countries in the Arab world. It runs 24 hours a day, commercial free. However, it's illegal to broadcast Alhurra within the United States. And in 2004, they developed a channel called Alhurra Iraq, which specifically deals with events occurring in Iraq and is broadcast to Iraq.Now I'm going to move on to another project I did. It's titled \"The Innocents.\" And for the men in these photographs, photography had been used to create a fantasy. Contradicting its function as evidence of a truth, in these instances it furthered the fabrication of a lie. I traveled across the United States photographing men and women who had been wrongfully convicted of crimes they did not commit, violent crimes.I investigate photography's ability to blur truth and fiction, and its influence on memory, which can lead to severe, even lethal consequences. For the men in these photographs, the primary cause of their wrongful conviction was mistaken identification. A victim or eyewitness identifies a suspected perpetrator through law enforcement's use of images. But through exposure to composite sketches, Polaroids, mug shots and line-ups, eyewitness testimony can change.I'll give you an example from a case. A woman was raped and presented with a series of photographs from which to identify her attacker. She saw some similarities in one of the photographs, but couldn't quite make a positive identification. Days later, she is presented with another photo array of all new photographs, except that one photograph that she had some draw to from the earlier array is repeated in the second array. And a positive identification is made because the photograph replaced the memory, if there ever was an actual memory.Photography offered the criminal justice system a tool that transformed innocent citizens into criminals, and the criminal justice system failed to recognize the limitations of relying on photographic identifications.Frederick Daye, who is photographed at his alibi location, where 13 witnesses placed him at the time of the crime. He was convicted by an all-white jury of rape, kidnapping and vehicle theft. And he served 10 years of a life sentence. Now DNA exonerated Frederick and it also implicated another man who was serving time in prison. But the victim refused to press charges because she claimed that law enforcement had permanently altered her memory through the use of Frederick's photograph.Charles Fain was convicted of kidnapping, rape and murder of a young girl walking to school. He served 18 years of a death sentence. I photographed him at the scene of the crime at the Snake River in Idaho. And I photographed all of the wrongfully convicted at sites that came to particular significance in the history of their wrongful conviction. The scene of arrest, the scene of misidentification, the alibi location. And here, the scene of the crime, it's this place to which he's never been, but changed his life forever. So photographing there, I was hoping to highlight the tenuous relationship between truth and fiction, in both his life and in photography.Calvin Washington was convicted of capital murder. He served 13 years of a life sentence in Waco, Texas.Larry Mayes, I photographed at the scene of arrest, where he hid between two mattresses in Gary, Indiana, in this very room to hide from the police. He ended up serving 18 and a half years of an 80 year sentence for rape and robbery. The victim failed to identify Larry in two live lineups and then made a positive identification, days later, from a photo array.Larry Youngblood served eight years of a 10 and half year sentence in Arizona for the abduction and repeated sodomizing of a 10 year old boy at a carnival. He is photographed at his alibi location.Ron Williamson. Ron was convicted of the rape and murder of a barmaid at a club, and served 11 years of a death sentence. I photographed Ron at a baseball field because he had been drafted to the Oakland A's to play professional baseball just before his conviction. And the state's key witness in Ron's case was, in the end, the actual perpetrator.Ronald Jones served eight years of a death sentence for rape and murder of a 28-year-old woman. I photographed him at the scene of arrest in Chicago.William Gregory was convicted of rape and burglary. He served seven years of a 70 year sentence in Kentucky.Timothy Durham, who I photographed at his alibi location where 11 witnesses placed him at the time of the crime, was convicted of 3.5 years of a 3220 year sentence, for several charges of rape and robbery. He had been misidentified by an 11-year-old victim.Troy Webb is photographed here at the scene of the crime in Virginia. He was convicted of rape, kidnapping and robbery, and served seven years of a 47 year sentence. Troy's picture was in a photo array that the victim tentatively had some draw toward, but said he looked too old. The police went and found a photograph of Troy Webb from four years earlier, which they entered into a photo array days later, and he was positively identified.Now I'm going to leave you with a self portrait. And it reiterates that distortion is a constant, and our eyes are easily deceived. That's it. Thank you.

phone calls\n\n00:00:23.958 --> 00:00:25.958\nto access my subjects,\n\n00:00:25.958 --> 00:00:28.958\nwhich can range from Hamas leaders in Gaza\n\n00:00:28.958 --> 00:00:31.958\nto a hibernating black bear in its cave\n\n00:00:31.958 --> 00:00:34.958\nin West Virginia.\n\n00:00:34.958 --> 00:00:37.958\nAnd oddly, the most notable\n\n00:00:37.958 --> 00:00:39.958\nletter of rejection I ever received\n\n00:00:39.958 --> 00:00:41.958\ncame from Walt Disney World,\n\n00:00:41.958 --> 00:00:43.958\na seemingly innocuous site.\n\n00:00:43.958 --> 00:00:46.958\nAnd it read -- I'm just going to read a key sentence:\n\n00:00:46.958 --> 00:00:49.958\n\"Especially during these violent times,\n\n00:00:49.958 --> 00:00:51.958\nI personally believe\n\n00:00:51.958 --> 00:00:55.958\nthat the magical spell cast upon guests who visit our theme parks\n\n00:00:55.958 --> 00:00:58.958\nis particularly important to protect\n\n00:00:58.958 --> 00:01:00.958\nand helps to provide them with an important fantasy\n\n00:01:00.958 --> 00:01:02.958\nthey can escape to.\"\n\n00:01:02.958 --> 00:01:05.958\nPhotography threatens fantasy.\n\n00:01:05.958 --> 00:01:07.958\nThey didn't want to let my camera in\n\n00:01:07.958 --> 00:01:11.958\nbecause it confronts constructed realities, myths and beliefs,\n\n00:01:11.958 --> 00:01:14.958\nand provides what appears to be\n\n00:01:14.958 --> 00:01:16.958\nevidence of a truth.\n\n00:01:16.958 --> 00:01:19.958\nBut there are multiple truths attached to every image,\n\n00:01:19.958 --> 00:01:22.958\ndepending on the creator's intention, the viewer\n\n00:01:22.958 --> 00:01:26.958\nand the context in which it is presented.\n\n00:01:26.958 --> 00:01:29.958\nOver a five year period following September 11th,\n\n00:01:29.958 --> 00:01:31.958\nwhen the American media and government were seeking\n\n00:01:31.958 --> 00:01:33.958\nhidden and unknown sites\n\n00:01:33.958 --> 00:01:35.958\nbeyond its borders,\n\n00:01:35.958 --> 00:01:38.958\nmost notably weapons of mass destruction,\n\n00:01:38.958 --> 00:01:41.958\nI chose to look inward at that which was integral\n\n00:01:41.958 --> 00:01:43.958\nto America's foundation,\n\n00:01:43.958 --> 00:01:45.958\nmythology and daily functioning.\n\n00:01:45.958 --> 00:01:48.958\nI wanted to confront the boundaries of the citizen,\n\n00:01:48.958 --> 00:01:50.958\nself-imposed and real,\n\n00:01:50.958 --> 00:01:53.958\nand confront the divide between privileged\n\n00:01:53.958 --> 00:01:57.958\nand public access to knowledge.\n\n00:01:57.958 --> 00:02:00.958\nIt was a critical moment in American history\n\n00:02:00.958 --> 00:02:02.958\nand global history\n\n00:02:02.958 --> 00:02:05.958\nwhere one felt they didn't have access to accurate information.\n\n00:02:05.958 --> 00:02:09.958\nAnd I wanted to see the center with my own eyes,\n\n00:02:09.958 --> 00:02:12.958\nbut what I came away with is a photograph.\n\n00:02:12.958 --> 00:02:14.958\nAnd it's just another place from which to observe,\n\n00:02:14.958 --> 00:02:16.958\nand the understanding that\n\n00:02:16.958 --> 00:02:19.958\nthere are no absolute, all-knowing insiders.\n\n00:02:19.958 --> 00:02:24.958\nAnd the outsider can never really reach the core.\n\n00:02:24.958 --> 00:02:28.958\nI'm going to run through some of the photographs in this series.\n\n00:02:28.958 --> 00:02:30.958\nIt's titled, \"An American Index\n\n00:02:30.958 --> 00:02:32.958\nof the Hidden and Unfamiliar,\"\n\n00:02:32.958 --> 00:02:35.958\nand it's comprised of nearly 70 images.\n\n00:02:35.958 --> 00:02:37.958\nIn this context I'll just show you a few.\n\n00:02:37.958 --> 00:02:42.958\nThis is a nuclear waste storage and encapsulation facility\n\n00:02:42.958 --> 00:02:44.958\nat Hanford site in Washington State,\n\n00:02:44.958 --> 00:02:46.958\nwhere there are over 1,900\n\n00:02:46.958 --> 00:02:48.958\nstainless steel capsules containing nuclear waste\n\n00:02:48.958 --> 00:02:50.958\nsubmerged in water.\n\n00:02:50.958 --> 00:02:54.958\nA human standing in front of an unprotected capsule would die instantly.\n\n00:02:54.958 --> 00:02:57.958\nAnd I found one section amongst all of these\n\n00:02:57.958 --> 00:02:59.958\nthat actually resembled the outline\n\n00:02:59.958 --> 00:03:01.958\nof the United States of America,\n\n00:03:01.958 --> 00:03:03.958\nwhich you can see here.\n\n00:03:03.958 --> 00:03:05.958\nAnd a big part of the work that is\n\n00:03:05.958 --> 00:03:09.958\nsort of absent in this context is text.\n\n00:03:09.958 --> 00:03:11.958\nSo I create these two poles.\n\n00:03:11.958 --> 00:03:15.958\nEvery image is accompanied with a very detailed factual text.\n\n00:03:15.958 --> 00:03:17.958\nAnd what I'm most interested in\n\n00:03:17.958 --> 00:03:20.958\nis the invisible space between a text\n\n00:03:20.958 --> 00:03:22.958\nand its accompanying image,\n\n00:03:22.958 --> 00:03:25.958\nand how the image is transformed by the text\n\n00:03:25.958 --> 00:03:27.958\nand the text by the image.\n\n00:03:27.958 --> 00:03:29.958\nSo, at best, the image is meant to float away\n\n00:03:29.958 --> 00:03:33.958\ninto abstraction and multiple truths and fantasy.\n\n00:03:33.958 --> 00:03:36.958\nAnd then the text functions as this cruel anchor\n\n00:03:36.958 --> 00:03:38.958\nthat kind of nails it to the ground.\n\n00:03:38.958 --> 00:03:41.958\nBut in this context I'm just going to read\n\n00:03:41.958 --> 00:03:43.958\nan abridged version of those texts.\n\n00:03:43.958 --> 00:03:46.958\nThis is a cryopreservation unit,\n\n00:03:46.958 --> 00:03:48.958\nand it holds the bodies of the wife and mother\n\n00:03:48.958 --> 00:03:50.958\nof cryonics pioneer Robert Ettinger,\n\n00:03:50.958 --> 00:03:53.958\nwho hoped to be awoken one day to extended life\n\n00:03:53.958 --> 00:03:57.958\nin good health, with advancements in science and technology,\n\n00:03:57.958 --> 00:04:02.958\nall for the cost of 35 thousand dollars, for forever.\n\n00:04:02.958 --> 00:04:05.958\nThis is a 21-year-old Palestinian woman\n\n00:04:05.958 --> 00:04:07.958\nundergoing hymenoplasty.\n\n00:04:07.958 --> 00:04:12.958\nHymenoplasty is a surgical procedure which restores the virginal state,\n\n00:04:12.958 --> 00:04:15.958\nallowing her to adhere to certain cultural expectations\n\n00:04:15.958 --> 00:04:17.958\nregarding virginity and marriage.\n\n00:04:17.958 --> 00:04:20.958\nSo it essentially reconstructs a ruptured hymen,\n\n00:04:20.958 --> 00:04:24.958\nallowing her to bleed upon having sexual intercourse,\n\n00:04:24.958 --> 00:04:27.958\nto simulate the loss of virginity.\n\n00:04:27.958 --> 00:04:30.958\nThis is a jury simulation deliberation room,\n\n00:04:30.958 --> 00:04:32.958\nand you can see beyond that two-way mirror\n\n00:04:32.958 --> 00:04:36.958\njury advisers standing in a room behind the mirror.\n\n00:04:36.958 --> 00:04:38.958\nAnd they observe deliberations\n\n00:04:38.958 --> 00:04:40.958\nafter mock trial proceedings\n\n00:04:40.958 --> 00:04:44.958\nso that they can better advise their clients how to adjust their trial strategy\n\n00:04:44.958 --> 00:04:47.958\nto have the outcome that they're hoping for.\n\n00:04:47.958 --> 00:04:52.958\nThis process costs 60,000 dollars.\n\n00:04:52.958 --> 00:04:56.958\nThis is a U.S. Customs and Border Protection room,\n\n00:04:56.958 --> 00:04:59.958\na contraband room, at John F. Kennedy International Airport.\n\n00:04:59.958 --> 00:05:02.958\nOn that table you can see 48 hours' worth\n\n00:05:02.958 --> 00:05:06.958\nof seized goods from passengers entering in to the United States.\n\n00:05:06.958 --> 00:05:10.958\nThere is a pig's head and African cane rats.\n\n00:05:10.958 --> 00:05:12.958\nAnd part of my photographic work\n\n00:05:12.958 --> 00:05:15.958\nis I'm not just documenting what's there.\n\n00:05:15.958 --> 00:05:18.958\nI do take certain liberties and intervene.\n\n00:05:18.958 --> 00:05:20.958\nAnd in this I really wanted it to resemble\n\n00:05:20.958 --> 00:05:22.958\nan early still-life painting,\n\n00:05:22.958 --> 00:05:27.958\nso I spent some time with the smells and items.\n\n00:05:27.958 --> 00:05:30.958\nThis is the exhibited art on the walls of the CIA\n\n00:05:30.958 --> 00:05:33.958\nin Langley, Virginia, their original headquarters building.\n\n00:05:33.958 --> 00:05:36.958\nAnd the CIA has had a long history\n\n00:05:36.958 --> 00:05:40.958\nwith both covert and public cultural diplomacy efforts.\n\n00:05:40.958 --> 00:05:42.958\nAnd it's speculated that some of their interest in the arts\n\n00:05:42.958 --> 00:05:45.958\nwas designed to counter Soviet communism\n\n00:05:45.958 --> 00:05:47.958\nand promote what it considered to be pro-American\n\n00:05:47.958 --> 00:05:49.958\nthoughts and aesthetics.\n\n00:05:49.958 --> 00:05:53.958\nAnd one of the art forms that elicited the interest of the agency,\n\n00:05:53.958 --> 00:05:59.958\nand had thus come under question, is abstract expressionism.\n\n00:05:59.958 --> 00:06:03.958\nThis is the Forensic Anthropology Research Facility,\n\n00:06:03.958 --> 00:06:05.958\nand on a six acre plot\n\n00:06:05.958 --> 00:06:09.958\nthere are approximately 75 cadavers at any given time\n\n00:06:09.958 --> 00:06:12.958\nthat are being studied by forensic anthropologists\n\n00:06:12.958 --> 00:06:15.958\nand researchers who are interested in monitoring\n\n00:06:15.958 --> 00:06:18.958\na rate of corpse decomposition.\n\n00:06:18.958 --> 00:06:21.958\nAnd in this particular photograph the body of a young boy\n\n00:06:21.958 --> 00:06:25.958\nhas been used to reenact a crime scene.\n\n00:06:25.958 --> 00:06:28.958\nThis is the only federally funded site\n\n00:06:28.958 --> 00:06:31.958\nwhere it is legal to cultivate cannabis\n\n00:06:31.958 --> 00:06:34.958\nfor scientific research in the United States.\n\n00:06:34.958 --> 00:06:36.958\nIt's a research crop marijuana grow room.\n\n00:06:36.958 --> 00:06:39.958\nAnd part of the work that I hope for\n\n00:06:39.958 --> 00:06:42.958\nis that there is a sort of disorienting entropy\n\n00:06:42.958 --> 00:06:46.958\nwhere you can't find any discernible formula in how these things --\n\n00:06:46.958 --> 00:06:49.958\nthey sort of awkwardly jump from government to science\n\n00:06:49.958 --> 00:06:51.958\nto religion to security --\n\n00:06:51.958 --> 00:06:54.958\nand you can't completely understand\n\n00:06:54.958 --> 00:06:58.958\nhow information is being distributed.\n\n00:06:58.958 --> 00:07:01.958\nThese are transatlantic submarine communication cables\n\n00:07:01.958 --> 00:07:04.958\nthat travel across the floor of the Atlantic Ocean,\n\n00:07:04.958 --> 00:07:06.958\nconnecting North America to Europe.\n\n00:07:06.958 --> 00:07:10.958\nThey carry over 60 million simultaneous voice conversations,\n\n00:07:10.958 --> 00:07:13.958\nand in a lot of the government and technology sites\n\n00:07:13.958 --> 00:07:16.958\nthere was just this very apparent vulnerability.\n\n00:07:16.958 --> 00:07:18.958\nThis one is almost humorous because it feels like I could\n\n00:07:18.958 --> 00:07:21.958\njust snip all of that conversation in one easy cut.\n\n00:07:21.958 --> 00:07:25.958\nBut stuff did feel like it could have been taken\n\n00:07:25.958 --> 00:07:29.958\n30 or 40 years ago, like it was locked in the Cold War era\n\n00:07:29.958 --> 00:07:32.958\nand hadn't necessarily progressed.\n\n00:07:32.958 --> 00:07:35.958\nThis is a Braille edition of Playboy magazine.\n\n00:07:35.958 --> 00:07:37.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:07:37.958 --> 00:07:39.958\nAnd this is ... a division of the Library of Congress\n\n00:07:39.958 --> 00:07:43.958\nproduces a free national library service\n\n00:07:43.958 --> 00:07:45.958\nfor the blind and visually impaired,\n\n00:07:45.958 --> 00:07:47.958\nand the publications they choose to publish\n\n00:07:47.958 --> 00:07:50.958\nare based on reader popularity.\n\n00:07:50.958 --> 00:07:52.958\nAnd Playboy is always in the top few.\n\n00:07:52.958 --> 00:07:54.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:07:54.958 --> 00:07:58.958\nBut you'd be surprised, they don't do the photographs.

brass detailing,\n\n00:09:46.958 --> 00:09:48.958\nand the painted acrylic facade.\n\n00:09:48.958 --> 00:09:50.958\nIn the context of the film,\n\n00:09:50.958 --> 00:09:53.958\nthis is a deep-space battle station of the Galactic Empire,\n\n00:09:53.958 --> 00:09:57.958\ncapable of annihilating planets and civilizations,\n\n00:09:57.958 --> 00:10:00.958\nand in reality it measures about four feet by two feet.\n\n00:10:00.958 --> 00:10:04.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:10:04.958 --> 00:10:07.958\nThis is at Fort Campbell in Kentucky.\n\n00:10:07.958 --> 00:10:10.958\nIt's a Military Operations on Urbanized Terrain site.\n\n00:10:10.958 --> 00:10:13.958\nEssentially they've simulated a city\n\n00:10:13.958 --> 00:10:15.958\nfor urban combat,\n\n00:10:15.958 --> 00:10:17.958\nand this is one of the structures that exists in that city.\n\n00:10:17.958 --> 00:10:20.958\nIt's called the World Church of God.\n\n00:10:20.958 --> 00:10:23.958\nIt's supposed to be a generic site of worship.\n\n00:10:23.958 --> 00:10:26.958\nAnd after I took this photograph,\n\n00:10:26.958 --> 00:10:28.958\nthey constructed a wall around the World Church of God\n\n00:10:28.958 --> 00:10:33.958\nto mimic the set-up of mosques in Afghanistan or Iraq.\n\n00:10:33.958 --> 00:10:35.958\nAnd I worked with Mehta Vihar\n\n00:10:35.958 --> 00:10:38.958\nwho creates virtual simulations for the army\n\n00:10:38.958 --> 00:10:40.958\nfor tactical practice.\n\n00:10:40.958 --> 00:10:42.958\nAnd we put that wall around the World Church of God,\n\n00:10:42.958 --> 00:10:46.958\nand also used the characters and vehicles and explosions\n\n00:10:46.958 --> 00:10:49.958\nthat are offered in the video games for the army.\n\n00:10:49.958 --> 00:10:53.958\nAnd I put them into my photograph.\n\n00:10:53.958 --> 00:10:55.958\nThis is live HIV virus\n\n00:10:55.958 --> 00:10:57.958\nat Harvard Medical School, who is working with the U.S. Government\n\n00:10:57.958 --> 00:11:01.958\nto develop sterilizing immunity.\n\n00:11:01.958 --> 00:11:04.958\nAnd Alhurra is a U.S. Government- sponsored\n\n00:11:04.958 --> 00:11:07.958\nArabic language television

free.\n\n00:11:15.958 --> 00:11:20.958\nHowever, it's illegal to broadcast Alhurra within the United States.\n\n00:11:20.958 --> 00:11:23.958\nAnd in 2004, they developed a channel called Alhurra Iraq,\n\n00:11:23.958 --> 00:11:26.958\nwhich specifically deals with events occurring in Iraq\n\n00:11:26.958 --> 00:11:29.958\nand is broadcast to Iraq.\n\n00:11:29.958 --> 00:11:31.958\nNow I'm going to move on to another project I did.\n\n00:11:31.958 --> 00:11:34.958\nIt's titled \"The Innocents.\"\n\n00:11:34.958 --> 00:11:36.958\nAnd for the men in these photographs,\n\n00:11:36.958 --> 00:11:39.958\nphotography had been used to create a fantasy.\n\n00:11:39.958 --> 00:11:42.958\nContradicting its function as evidence of a truth,\n\n00:11:42.958 --> 00:11:46.958\nin these instances it furthered the fabrication of a lie.\n\n00:11:46.958 --> 00:11:48.958\nI traveled across the United States\n\n00:11:48.958 --> 00:11:51.958\nphotographing men and women who had been wrongfully convicted\n\n00:11:51.958 --> 00:11:55.958\nof crimes they did not commit, violent crimes.\n\n00:11:55.958 --> 00:11:59.958\nI investigate photography's ability to blur truth and fiction,\n\n00:11:59.958 --> 00:12:01.958\nand its influence on memory,\n\n00:12:01.958 --> 00:12:05.958\nwhich can lead to severe, even lethal consequences.\n\n00:12:05.958 --> 00:12:07.958\nFor the men in these photographs,\n\n00:12:07.958 --> 00:12:09.958\nthe primary cause of their wrongful conviction\n\n00:12:09.958 --> 00:12:12.958\nwas mistaken identification.\n\n00:12:12.958 --> 00:12:14.958\nA victim or eyewitness identifies\n\n00:12:14.958 --> 00:12:16.958\na suspected perpetrator\n\n00:12:16.958 --> 00:12:19.958\nthrough law enforcement's use of images.\n\n00:12:19.958 --> 00:12:21.958\nBut through exposure to composite sketches,\n\n00:12:21.958 --> 00:12:24.958\nPolaroids, mug shots and line-ups,\n\n00:12:24.958 --> 00:12:26.958\neyewitness testimony can change.\n\n00:12:26.958 --> 00:12:29.958\nI'll give you an example from a case.\n\n00:12:29.958 --> 00:12:32.958\nA woman was raped and presented with a series of photographs\n\n00:12:32.958 --> 00:12:34.958\nfrom which to identify her attacker.\n\n00:12:34.958 --> 00:12:38.958\nShe saw some similarities in one of the photographs,\n\n00:12:38.958 --> 00:12:40.958\nbut couldn't quite make a positive identification.\n\n00:12:40.958 --> 00:12:44.958\nDays later, she is presented with another photo array\n\n00:12:44.958 --> 00:12:46.958\nof all new photographs,\n\n00:12:46.958 --> 00:12:49.958\nexcept that one photograph that she had some draw to\n\n00:12:49.958 --> 00:12:52.958\nfrom the earlier array is repeated in the second array.\n\n00:12:52.958 --> 00:12:55.958\nAnd a positive identification is made\n\n00:12:55.958 --> 00:12:57.958\nbecause the photograph replaced the memory,\n\n00:12:57.958 --> 00:13:01.958\nif there ever was an actual memory.\n\n00:13:01.958 --> 00:13:04.958\nPhotography offered the criminal justice system\n\n00:13:04.958 --> 00:13:07.958\na tool that transformed innocent citizens into criminals,\n\n00:13:07.958 --> 00:13:11.958\nand the criminal justice system failed to recognize the limitations\n\n00:13:11.958 --> 00:13:15.958\nof relying on photographic identifications.\n\n00:13:15.958 --> 00:13:19.958\nFrederick Daye, who is photographed at his alibi location,\n\n00:13:19.958 --> 00:13:22.958\nwhere 13 witnesses placed him at the time of the crime.\n\n00:13:22.958 --> 00:13:25.958\nHe was convicted by an all-white jury\n\n00:13:25.958 --> 00:13:27.958\nof rape, kidnapping and vehicle theft.\n\n00:13:27.958 --> 00:13:31.958\nAnd he served 10 years of a life sentence.\n\n00:13:31.958 --> 00:13:33.958\nNow DNA exonerated Frederick\n\n00:13:33.958 --> 00:13:35.958\nand it also implicated another man\n\n00:13:35.958 --> 00:13:37.958\nwho was serving time in prison.\n\n00:13:37.958 --> 00:13:39.958\nBut the victim refused to press charges\n\n00:13:39.958 --> 00:13:41.958\nbecause she claimed that law enforcement\n\n00:13:41.958 --> 00:13:46.958\nhad permanently altered her memory through the use of Frederick's photograph.\n\n00:13:46.958 --> 00:13:50.958\nCharles Fain was convicted of kidnapping, rape and murder\n\n00:13:50.958 --> 00:13:52.958\nof a young girl walking to school.\n\n00:13:52.958 --> 00:13:55.958\nHe served 18 years of a death sentence.\n\n00:13:55.958 --> 00:13:57.958\nI photographed him at the scene of the crime\n\n00:13:57.958 --> 00:13:59.958\nat the Snake River in Idaho.\n\n00:13:59.958 --> 00:14:03.958\nAnd I photographed all of the wrongfully convicted\n\n00:14:03.958 --> 00:14:08.958\nat sites that came to particular significance\n\n00:14:08.958 --> 00:14:10.958\nin the history of their wrongful conviction.\n\n00:14:10.958 --> 00:14:12.958\nThe scene of arrest, the scene of misidentification,\n\n00:14:12.958 --> 00:14:14.958\nthe alibi location.\n\n00:14:14.958 --> 00:14:16.958\nAnd here, the scene of the crime, it's this place\n\n00:14:16.958 --> 00:14:20.958\nto which he's never been, but changed his life forever.\n\n00:14:20.958 --> 00:14:22.958\nSo photographing there, I was hoping to highlight\n\n00:14:22.958 --> 00:14:25.958\nthe tenuous relationship between truth and fiction,\n\n00:14:25.958 --> 00:14:30.958\nin both his life and in photography.\n\n00:14:30.958 --> 00:14:33.958\nCalvin Washington was convicted of capital murder.\n\n00:14:33.958 --> 00:14:38.958\nHe served 13 years of a life sentence in Waco, Texas.\n\n00:14:38.958 --> 00:14:41.958\nLarry Mayes, I photographed at the scene of arrest,\n\n00:14:41.958 --> 00:14:43.958\nwhere he hid between two mattresses in Gary, Indiana,\n\n00:14:43.958 --> 00:14:47.958\nin this very room to hide from the police.\n\n00:14:47.958 --> 00:14:49.958\nHe ended up serving 18 and a half years\n\n00:14:49.958 --> 00:14:52.958\nof an 80 year sentence for rape and robbery.\n\n00:14:52.958 --> 00:14:54.958\nThe victim failed to identify Larry\n\n00:14:54.958 --> 00:14:56.958\nin two live lineups\n\n00:14:56.958 --> 00:14:59.958\nand then made a positive identification, days later,\n\n00:14:59.958 --> 00:15:02.958\nfrom a photo array.\n\n00:15:02.958 --> 00:15:05.958\nLarry Youngblood served eight years of a 10 and half year sentence\n\n00:15:05.958

Arguably the financial markets have failed us and the aid system is failing us, and yet I stand firmly with the optimists who believe that there has probably never been a more exciting moment to be alive. Because of some of technologies we've been talking about. Because of the resources, the skills, and certainly the surge of talent we're seeing all around the world, with the mindset to create change. And we've got a president who sees himself as a global citizen, who recognizes that no longer is there a single superpower, but that we've got to engage in a different way with the world.And by definition, every one of you who is in this room must consider yourself a global soul, a global citizen. You work on the front lines. And you've seen the best and the worst that human beings can do for one another and to one another. And no matter what country you live or work in, you've also seen the extraordinary things that individuals are capable of, even in their most ordinariness.Today there is a raging debate as to how best we lift people out of poverty, how best we release their energies. On the one hand, we have people that say the aid system is so broken we need to throw it out. And on the other we have people who say the problem is that we need more aid. And what I want to talk about is something that compliments both systems. We call it patient capital.The critics point to the 500 billion dollars spent in Africa since 1970 and say, and what do we have but environmental degradation and incredible levels of poverty, rampant corruption? They use Mobutu as metaphor. And their policy prescription is to make government more accountable, focus on the capital markets, invest, don't give anything away.On the other side, as I said, there are those who say the problem is that we need more money. That when it comes to the rich, we'll bail out and we'll hand a lot of aid, but when it comes to our poor brethren, we want little to do with it. They point to the successes of aid: the eradication of smallpox, and the distribution of tens of millions of malaria bed nets and antiretrovirals. Both sides are right. And the problem is that neither side is listening to the other. Even more problematic, they're not listening to poor people themselves.After 25 years of working on issues of poverty and innovation, it's true that there are probably no more market-oriented individuals on the planet than low-income people. They must navigate markets daily, making micro-decisions, dozens and dozens, to move their way through society, and yet if a single catastrophic health problem impacts their family, they could be put back into poverty, sometimes for generations. And so we need both the market and we need aid.Patient capital works between, and tries to take the best of both. It's money that's invested in entrepreneurs who know their communities and are building solutions to healthcare, water, housing, alternative energy, thinking of low income people not as passive recipients of charity, but as individual customers, consumers, clients, people who want to make decisions in their own lives.Patient capital requires that we have incredible tolerance for risk, a long time horizon in terms of allowing those entrepreneurs time to experiment, to use the market as the best listening device that we have, and the expectation of below-market returns, but outsized social impact. It recognizes that the market has its limitation, and so patient capital also works with smart subsidy to extend the benefits of a global economy to include all people.Now, entrepreneurs need patient capital for three reasons. First, they tend to work in markets where people make one, two, three dollars a day and they are making all of their decisions within that income level. Second, the geographies in which they work have terrible infrastructure \u2014 no roads to speak of, sporadic electricity and high levels of corruption. Third, they are often creating markets.Even if you're bringing clean water for the first time into rural villages, it is something new. And so many low-income people have seen so many failed promises broken and seen so many quacks and sporadic medicines offered to them that building trust takes a lot of time, takes a lot of patience. It also requires being connected to a lot of management assistance. Not only to build the systems, the business models that allow us to reach low income people in a sustainable way, but to connect those business to other markets, to governments, to corporations \u2014 real partnerships if we want to get to scale.I want to share one story about an innovation called drip irrigation. In 2002 I met this incredible entrepreneur named Amitabha Sadangi from India, who'd been working for 20 years with some of the poorest farmers on the planet. And he was expressing his frustration that the aid market had bypassed low-income farmers altogether, despite the fact that 200 million farmers alone in India make under a dollar a day. They were creating subsidies either for large farms, or they were giving inputs to the farmers that they thought they should use, rather than that the farmers wanted to use.At the same time Amitabha was obsessed with this drip irrigation technology that had been invented in Israel. It was a way of bringing small amounts of water directly to the stalk of the plant. And it could transform swaths of desert land into fields of emerald green. But the market also had bypassed low income farmers, because these systems were both too expensive, and they were constructed for fields that were too large. The average small village farmer works on two acres or less.And so, Amitabha decided that he would take that innovation and he would redesign it from the perspective of the poor farmers themselves, because he spent so many years listening to what they needed not what he thought that they should have. And he used three fundamental principles.The first one was miniaturization. The drip irrigation system had to be small enough that a farmer only had to risk a quarter acre, even if he had two, because it was too frightening, given all that he had at stake. Second, it had to be extremely affordable. In other words, that risk on the quarter acre needed to be repaid in a single harvest, or else they wouldn't take the risk. And third, it had to be what Amitabha calls infinitely expandable. What I mean is with the profits from the first quarter acre, the farmers could buy a second and a third and a fourth.As of today, IDE India, Amitabha's organization, has sold over 300,000 farmers these systems and has seen their yields and incomes double or triple on average, but this didn't happen overnight. In fact, when you go back to the beginning, there were no private investors who would be willing to take a risk on building a new technology for a market class that made under a dollar a day, that were known to be some of the most risk-averse people on the planet and that were working in one of the riskiest sectors, agriculture.And so we needed grants. And he used significant grants to research, to experiment, to fail, to innovate and try again. And when he had a prototype and had a better understanding of how to market to farmers, that's when patient capital could come in. And we helped him build a company, for profit, that would build on IDE's knowledge, and start looking at sales and exports, and be able to tap into other kinds of capital.Secondarily, we wanted to see if we could export this drip irrigation and bring it into other countries. And so we met Dr. Sono Khangharani in Pakistan. And while, again, you needed patience to move a technology for the poor in India into Pakistan, just to get the permits, over time we were able to start a company with Dr. Sono, who runs a large community development organization in the Thar Desert, which is one of the remote and poorest areas of the country. And though that company has just started, our assumption is that there too we'll see the impact on millions.But drip irrigation isn't the only innovation. We're starting to see these happening all around the world. In Arusha, Tanzania, A to Z Textile Manufacturing has worked in partnership with us, with UNICEF, with the Global Fund, to create a factory that now employs 7,000 people, mostly women. And they produce 20 million lifesaving bednets for Africans around the world.Lifespring Hospital is a joint venture between Acumen and the government of India to bring quality, affordable maternal health care to low-income women, and it's been so successful that it's currently building a new hospital every 35 days.And 1298 Ambulances decided that it was going to reinvent a completely broken industry, building an ambulance service in Bombay that would use the technology of Google Earth, a sliding scale pricing system so that all people could have access, and a severe and public decision not to engage in any form of corruption. So that in the terrorist attacks of November they were the first responder, and are now beginning to scale, because of partnership. They've just won four government contracts to build off their 100 ambulances, and are one of the largest and most effective ambulance companies in India.This idea of scale is critical. Because we're starting to see these enterprises reach hundreds of thousands of people. All of the ones I discussed have reached at least a quarter million people. But that's obviously not enough. And it's where the idea of partnership becomes so important. Whether it's by finding those innovations that can access the capital markets, government itself, or partner with major corporations, there is unbelievable opportunity for innovation.President Obama understands that. He recently authorized the creation of a Social Innovation Fund to focus on what works in this country, and look at how we can scale it. And I would submit that it's time to consider a global innovation fund that would find these entrepreneurs around the world who really have innovations, not only for their country, but ones that we can use in the developed world as well. Invest financial assistance, but also management assistance. And then measure the returns, both from a financial perspective and from a social impact perspective.When we think about new approaches to aid, it's impossible not to talk about Pakistan. We've had a rocky relationship with that country and, in all fairness, the United States has not always been a very reliable partner. But again I would say that this is our moment for extraordinary things to happen. And if we take that notion of a global innovation fund, we could use this time to invest not directly in government, though we would have government's blessing, nor in international experts, but in the many existing entrepreneurs and civil society leaders who already are building wonderful innovations that are reaching people all across the country.People like Rashani Zafar, who created one of the largest microfinance banks in the country, and is a real role model for women inside and outside the country. And Tasneem Siddiqui, who developed a way called incremental housing, where he has moved 40,000 slum dwellers into safe, affordable community housing. Educational initiatives like DIL and The Citizen Foundation that are building schools across the country. It's not hyperbole to say that these civil society institutions and these social entrepreneurs are building real alternatives to the Taliban.I've invested in Pakistan for over seven years now, and those of you who've also worked there can attest that Pakistanis are an incredibly hard working population, and there is a fierce upward mobility in their very nature.President Kennedy said that those who make peaceful revolution impossible make violent revolution inevitable. I would say that the converse is true. That these social leaders who really are looking at innovation and extending opportunity to the 70 percent of Pakistanis who make less than two dollars a day, provide real pathways to hope. And as we think about how we construct aid for Pakistan, while we need to strengthen the judiciary, build greater stability, we also need to think about lifting those leaders who can be role models for the rest of the world.On one of my last visits to Pakistan, I asked Dr. Sono if he would take me to see some of the drip irrigation in the Thar Desert. And we left Karachi one morning before dawn. It was about 115 degrees. And we drove for eight hours along this moonscape-like landscape with very little color, lots of heat, very little discussion, because we were exhausted.And finally, at the end of the journey, I could see this thin little yellow line across the horizon. And as we got closer, its significance became apparent. That there in the desert was a field of sunflowers growing seven feet tall. Because one of the poorest farmers on Earth had gotten access to a technology that had allowed him to change his own life. His name was Raja, and he had kind, twinkly hazel eyes and warm expressive hands that reminded me of my father.And he said it was the first dry season in his entire life that he hadn't taken his 12 children and 50 grandchildren on a two day journey across the desert to work as day laborers at a commercial farm for about 50 cents a day. Because he was building these crops. And with the money he earned he could stay this year. And for the first time ever in three generations, his children would go to school.We asked him if he would send his daughters as well as his sons. And he said, \"Of course I will. Because I don't want them discriminated against anymore.\" When we think about solutions to poverty, we cannot deny individuals their fundamental dignity. Because at the end of the day, dignity is more important to the human spirit than wealth. And what's exciting is to see so many entrepreneurs across sectors who are building innovations that recognize that what people want is freedom and choice and opportunity. Because that is where dignity really starts.Martin Luther King said that love without power is anemic and sentimental, and that power without love is reckless and abusive. Our generation has seen both approaches tried, and often fail. But I think our generation also might be the first to have the courage to embrace both love and power. For that is what we'll need, as we move forward to dream and imagine what it will really take to build a global economy that includes all of us, and to finally extend that fundamental proposition that all men are created equal to every human being on the planet.The time for us to begin innovating and looking for new solutions, a cross sector, is now. I can only talk from my own experience, but in eight years of running Acumen fund, I've seen the power of patient capital. Not only to inspire innovation and risk taking, but to truly build systems that have created more than 25,000 jobs and delivered tens of millions of services and products to some of the poorest people on the planet. I know it works. But I know that many other kinds of innovation also work.And so I urge you, in whatever sector you work, in whatever job you do, to start thinking about how we might build solutions that start from the perspective of those we're trying to help. Rather than what we think that they might need. It will take embracing the world with both arms. And it will take living with the spirit of generosity and accountability, with a sense of integrity and perseverance. And yet these are the very qualities for which men and women have been honored throughout the generations. And there is so much good that we can do. Just think of all those sunflowers in the desert. Thank you.

And you've seen the best and the worst\n\n00:00:58.958 --> 00:01:02.958\nthat human beings can do for one another and to one another.\n\n00:01:02.958 --> 00:01:04.958\nAnd no matter what country you live or work in,\n\n00:01:04.958 --> 00:01:08.958\nyou've also seen the extraordinary things that individuals are capable of,\n\n00:01:08.958 --> 00:01:11.958\neven in their most ordinariness.\n\n00:01:11.958 --> 00:01:14.958\nToday there is a raging debate\n\n00:01:14.958 --> 00:01:18.958\nas to how best we lift people out of poverty,\n\n00:01:18.958 --> 00:01:20.958\nhow best we release their energies.\n\n00:01:20.958 --> 00:01:22.958\nOn the one hand, we have people that say\n\n00:01:22.958 --> 00:01:25.958\nthe aid system is so broken we need to throw it out.\n\n00:01:25.958 --> 00:01:27.958\nAnd on the other we have people who say\n\n00:01:27.958 --> 00:01:29.958\nthe problem is that we need more aid.\n\n00:01:29.958 --> 00:01:33.958\nAnd what I want to talk about is something that compliments both systems.\n\n00:01:33.958 --> 00:01:35.958\nWe call it patient capital.\n\n00:01:35.958 --> 00:01:38.958\nThe critics point to the 500 billion dollars spent\n\n00:01:38.958 --> 00:01:41.958\nin Africa since 1970\n\n00:01:41.958 --> 00:01:44.958\nand say, and what do we have but environmental degradation\n\n00:01:44.958 --> 00:01:48.958\nand incredible levels of poverty, rampant corruption?\n\n00:01:48.958 --> 00:01:51.958\nThey use Mobutu as metaphor.\n\n00:01:51.958 --> 00:01:55.958\nAnd their policy prescription is to\n\n00:01:55.958 --> 00:01:57.958\nmake government more accountable,\n\n00:01:57.958 --> 00:01:59.958\nfocus on the capital markets,\n\n00:01:59.958 --> 00:02:02.958\ninvest, don't give anything away.\n\n00:02:02.958 --> 00:02:04.958\nOn the other side, as I said, there are those who say\n\n00:02:04.958 --> 00:02:06.958\nthe problem is that we need more money.\n\n00:02:06.958 --> 00:02:09.958\nThat when it comes to the rich, we'll bail out\n\n00:02:09.958 --> 00:02:11.958\nand we'll hand a lot of aid,\n\n00:02:11.958 --> 00:02:13.958\nbut when it comes to our poor brethren,\n\n00:02:13.958 --> 00:02:15.958\nwe want little to do with it.\n\n00:02:15.958 --> 00:02:17.958\nThey point to the successes of aid:\n\n00:02:17.958 --> 00:02:19.958\nthe eradication of smallpox,\n\n00:02:19.958 --> 00:02:22.958\nand the distribution of tens of millions\n\n00:02:22.958 --> 00:02:26.958\nof malaria bed nets and antiretrovirals.\n\n00:02:26.958 --> 00:02:28.958\nBoth sides are right.\n\n00:02:28.958 --> 00:02:31.958\nAnd the problem is that neither side is listening to the other.\n\n00:02:31.958 --> 00:02:34.958\nEven more problematic, they're not listening to\n\n00:02:34.958 --> 00:02:36.958\npoor people themselves.\n\n00:02:36.958 --> 00:02:38.958\nAfter 25 years of working on issues of\n\n00:02:38.958 --> 00:02:40.958\npoverty and innovation,\n\n00:02:40.958 --> 00:02:44.958\nit's true that there are probably no more market-oriented\n\n00:02:44.958 --> 00:02:46.958\nindividuals on the planet\n\n00:02:46.958 --> 00:02:48.958\nthan low-income people.\n\n00:02:48.958 --> 00:02:51.958\nThey must navigate markets daily,\n\n00:02:51.958 --> 00:02:54.958\nmaking micro-decisions, dozens and dozens,\n\n00:02:54.958 --> 00:02:56.958\nto move their way through society,\n\n00:02:56.958 --> 00:02:59.958\nand yet if a single catastrophic health problem\n\n00:02:59.958 --> 00:03:01.958\nimpacts their family,\n\n00:03:01.958 --> 00:03:05.958\nthey could be put back into poverty, sometimes for generations.\n\n00:03:05.958 --> 00:03:07.958\nAnd so we need both the market\n\n00:03:07.958 --> 00:03:10.958\nand we need aid.\n\n00:03:10.958 --> 00:03:13.958\nPatient capital works between,\n\n00:03:13.958 --> 00:03:15.958\nand tries to take the best of both.\n\n00:03:15.958 --> 00:03:18.958\nIt's money that's invested in entrepreneurs who know their communities\n\n00:03:18.958 --> 00:03:20.958\nand are building solutions\n\n00:03:20.958 --> 00:03:23.958\nto healthcare, water, housing, alternative energy,\n\n00:03:23.958 --> 00:03:28.958\nthinking of low income people not as passive recipients of charity,\n\n00:03:28.958 --> 00:03:31.958\nbut as individual customers, consumers, clients,\n\n00:03:31.958 --> 00:03:34.958\npeople who want to make decisions in their own lives.\n\n00:03:34.958 --> 00:03:36.958\nPatient capital requires that we have\n\n00:03:36.958 --> 00:03:39.958\nincredible tolerance for risk,\n\n00:03:39.958 --> 00:03:41.958\na long time horizon in terms of allowing those\n\n00:03:41.958 --> 00:03:43.958\nentrepreneurs time to experiment,\n\n00:03:43.958 --> 00:03:47.958\nto use the market as the best listening device that we have,\n\n00:03:47.958 --> 00:03:50.958\nand the expectation of below-market returns,\n\n00:03:50.958 --> 00:03:53.958\nbut outsized social impact.\n\n00:03:53.958 --> 00:03:56.958\nIt recognizes that the market has its limitation,\n\n00:03:56.958 --> 00:03:59.958\nand so patient capital also works\n\n00:03:59.958 --> 00:04:02.958\nwith smart subsidy to extend the benefits of a global economy\n\n00:04:02.958 --> 00:04:04.958\nto include all people.\n\n00:04:04.958 --> 00:04:06.958\nNow, entrepreneurs need patient capital\n\n00:04:06.958 --> 00:04:08.958\nfor three reasons.\n\n00:04:08.958 --> 00:04:10.958\nFirst, they tend to work in markets\n\n00:04:10.958 --> 00:04:12.958\nwhere people make one, two, three dollars a day\n\n00:04:12.958 --> 00:04:16.958\nand they are making all of their decisions within that income level.\n\n00:04:16.958 --> 00:04:18.958\nSecond, the geographies in which they work\n\n00:04:18.958 --> 00:04:20.958\nhave terrible infrastructure --\n\n00:04:20.958 --> 00:04:22.958\nno roads to speak of, sporadic electricity\n\n00:04:22.958 --> 00:04:26.958\nand high levels of corruption.\n\n00:04:26.958 --> 00:04:28.958\nThird, they are often creating markets.\n\n00:04:28.958 --> 00:04:30.958\nEven if you're bringing clean water\n\n00:04:30.958 --> 00:04:33.958\nfor the first time into rural villages, it is something new.\n\n00:04:33.958 --> 00:04:35.958\nAnd so many low-income people\n\n00:04:35.958 --> 00:04:39.958\nhave seen so many failed promises broken\n\n00:04:39.958 --> 00:04:43.958\nand seen so many quacks and sporadic medicines offered to them\n\n00:04:43.958 --> 00:04:46.958\nthat building trust takes a lot of time,\n\n00:04:46.958 --> 00:04:48.958\ntakes a lot of patience.\n\n00:04:48.958 --> 00:04:52.958\nIt also requires being connected to a lot of management assistance.\n\n00:04:52.958 --> 00:04:54.958\nNot only to build the systems,\n\n00:04:54.958 --> 00:04:56.958\nthe business models that allow us\n\n00:04:56.958 --> 00:04:58.958\nto reach low income people in a sustainable way,\n\n00:04:58.958 --> 00:05:00.958\nbut to connect those business\n\n00:05:00.958 --> 00:05:03.958\nto other markets, to governments, to corporations --\n\n00:05:03.958 --> 00:05:07.958\nreal partnerships if we want to get to scale.\n\n00:05:07.958 --> 00:05:09.958\nI want to share one story\n\n00:05:09.958 --> 00:05:11.958\nabout an innovation called drip irrigation.\n\n00:05:11.958 --> 00:05:14.958\nIn 2002 I met this incredible entrepreneur\n\n00:05:14.958 --> 00:05:17.958\nnamed Amitabha Sadangi from India,\n\n00:05:17.958 --> 00:05:21.958\nwho'd been working for 20 years with some of the poorest farmers on the planet.\n\n00:05:21.958 --> 00:05:23.958\nAnd he was expressing his frustration\n\n00:05:23.958 --> 00:05:26.958\nthat the aid market had bypassed low-income farmers altogether,\n\n00:05:26.958 --> 00:05:28.958\ndespite the fact that 200 million farmers\n\n00:05:28.958 --> 00:05:31.958\nalone in India make under a dollar a day.\n\n00:05:31.958 --> 00:05:33.958\nThey were creating subsidies\n\n00:05:33.958 --> 00:05:35.958\neither for large farms,\n\n00:05:35.958 --> 00:05:37.958\nor they were giving inputs to the farmers\n\n00:05:37.958 --> 00:05:39.958\nthat they thought they should use, rather than\n\n00:05:39.958 --> 00:05:41.958\nthat the farmers wanted to use.\n\n00:05:41.958 --> 00:05:43.958\nAt the same time Amitabha was\n\n00:05:43.958 --> 00:05:46.958\nobsessed with this drip irrigation technology\n\n00:05:46.958 --> 00:05:49.958\nthat had been invented in Israel.\n\n00:05:49.958 --> 00:05:52.958\nIt was a way of bringing small amounts of water\n\n00:05:52.958 --> 00:05:54.958\ndirectly to the stalk of the plant.\n\n00:05:54.958 --> 00:05:56.958\nAnd it could transform\n\n00:05:56.958 --> 00:05:59.958\nswaths of desert land into fields of emerald green.\n\n00:05:59.958 --> 00:06:03.958\nBut the market also had bypassed low income farmers,\n\n00:06:03.958 --> 00:06:05.958\nbecause these systems were both too expensive,\n\n00:06:05.958 --> 00:06:08.958\nand they were constructed for fields that were too large.\n\n00:06:08.958 --> 00:06:10.958\nThe average small village farmer\n\n00:06:10.958 --> 00:06:13.958\nworks on two acres or less.\n\n00:06:13.958 --> 00:06:16.958\nAnd so, Amitabha decided that he would take that innovation\n\n00:06:16.958 --> 00:06:18.958\nand he would redesign it from the perspective\n\n00:06:18.958 --> 00:06:20.958\nof the poor farmers themselves,\n\n00:06:20.958 --> 00:06:23.958\nbecause he spent so many years listening to what they needed\n\n00:06:23.958 --> 00:06:25.958\nnot what he thought that they should have.\n\n00:06:25.958 --> 00:06:27.958\nAnd he used three fundamental principles.\n\n00:06:27.958 --> 00:06:30.958\nThe first one was miniaturization.\n\n00:06:30.958 --> 00:06:32.958\nThe drip irrigation system\n\n00:06:32.958 --> 00:06:34.958\nhad to be small enough that a farmer only had\n\n00:06:34.958 --> 00:06:37.958\nto risk a quarter acre,\n\n00:06:37.958 --> 00:06:39.958\neven if he had two,\n\n00:06:39.958 --> 00:06:42.958\nbecause it was too frightening, given all that he had at stake.\n\n00:06:42.958 --> 00:06:46.958\nSecond, it had to be extremely affordable.\n\n00:06:46.958 --> 00:06:49.958\nIn other words, that risk on the quarter acre\n\n00:06:49.958 --> 00:06:52.958\nneeded to be repaid in a single harvest,\n\n00:06:52.958 --> 00:06:54.958\nor else they wouldn't take the risk.\n\n00:06:54.958 --> 00:06:56.958\nAnd third, it had to be what Amitabha calls\n\n00:06:56.958 --> 00:06:58.958\ninfinitely expandable.\n\n00:06:58.958 --> 00:07:01.958\nWhat I mean is with the profits from the first quarter acre,\n\n00:07:01.958 --> 00:07:03.958\nthe farmers could buy a second\n\n00:07:03.958 --> 00:07:05.958\nand a third and a fourth.\n\n00:07:05.958 --> 00:07:08.958\nAs of today, IDE India, Amitabha's organization,\n\n00:07:08.958 --> 00:07:11.958\nhas sold over 300,000 farmers these systems\n\n00:07:11.958 --> 00:07:13.958\nand has seen their yields and incomes\n\n00:07:13.958 --> 00:07:15.958\ndouble or triple on average,\n\n00:07:15.958 --> 00:07:18.958\nbut this didn't happen overnight.\n\n00:07:18.958 --> 00:07:20.958\nIn fact, when you go back to the beginning,\n\n00:07:20.958 --> 00:07:22.958\nthere were no private investors\n\n00:07:22.958 --> 00:07:25.958\nwho would be willing to take a risk on building a new technology\n\n00:07:25.958 --> 00:07:28.958\nfor a market class that made under a dollar a day,\n\n00:07:28.958 --> 00:07:31.958\nthat were known to be some of the most risk-averse people on the planet\n\n00:07:31.958 --> 00:07:35.958\nand that were working in one of the riskiest sectors, agriculture.\n\n00:07:35.958 --> 00:07:38.958\nAnd so we needed grants. And he used significant grants\n\n00:07:38.958 --> 00:07:41.958\nto research, to experiment, to fail,\n\n00:07:41.958 --> 00:07:43.958\nto innovate and try again.\n\n00:07:43.958 --> 00:07:46.958\nAnd when he had a prototype\n\n00:07:46.958 --> 00:07:49.958\nand had a better understanding of how to market to farmers,\n\n00:07:49.958 --> 00:07:51.958\nthat's when patient capital could come in.\n\n00:07:51.958 --> 00:07:54.958\nAnd we helped him build a company, for profit,\n\n00:07:54.958 --> 00:07:57.958\nthat would build on IDE's knowledge,\n\n00:07:57.958 --> 00:07:59.958\nand start looking at sales and exports,\n\n00:07:59.958 --> 00:08:03.958\nand be able to tap into other kinds of capital.\n\n00:08:03.958 --> 00:08:06.958\nSecondarily, we wanted to see if we could export\n\n00:08:06.958 --> 00:08:09.958\nthis drip irrigation and bring it into other countries.\n\n00:08:09.958 --> 00:08:13.958\nAnd so we met Dr. Sono Khangharani in Pakistan.\n\n00:08:13.958 --> 00:08:15.958\nAnd while, again, you needed patience\n\n00:08:15.958 --> 00:08:17.958\nto move a technology for the poor\n\n00:08:17.958 --> 00:08:19.958\nin India into Pakistan,\n\n00:08:19.958 --> 00:08:21.958\njust to get the permits,\n\n00:08:21.958 --> 00:08:24.958\nover time we were able to start a company\n\n00:08:24.958 --> 00:08:26.958\nwith Dr. Sono, who runs a large\n\n00:08:26.958 --> 00:08:29.958\ncommunity development organization in the Thar Desert,\n\n00:08:29.958 --> 00:08:32.958\nwhich is one of the remote and poorest areas of the country.\n\n00:08:32.958 --> 00:08:34.958\nAnd though that company has just started,\n\n00:08:34.958 --> 00:08:36.958\nour assumption is that there too\n\n00:08:36.958 --> 00:08:39.958\nwe'll see the impact on millions.\n\n00:08:39.958 --> 00:08:41.958\nBut drip irrigation isn't the only innovation.\n\n00:08:41.958 --> 00:08:44.958\nWe're starting to see these happening all around the world.\n\n00:08:44.958 --> 00:08:49.958\nIn Arusha, Tanzania, A to Z Textile Manufacturing\n\n00:08:49.958 --> 00:08:51.958\nhas worked in partnership with us,\n\n00:08:51.958 --> 00:08:53.958\nwith UNICEF, with the Global Fund,\n\n00:08:53.958 --> 00:08:56.958\nto create a factory that now employs 7,000 people, mostly women.\n\n00:08:56.958 --> 00:08:58.958\nAnd they produce 20 million lifesaving bednets\n\n00:08:58.958 --> 00:09:02.958\nfor Africans around the world.\n\n00:09:02.958 --> 00:09:04.958\nLifespring Hospital\n\n00:09:04.958 --> 00:09:06.958\nis a joint venture between Acumen and the government of India\n\n00:09:06.958 --> 00:09:10.958\nto bring quality, affordable maternal health care\n\n00:09:10.958 --> 00:09:12.958\nto low-income women,\n\n00:09:12.958 --> 00:09:14.958\nand it's been so successful that it's currently building\n\n00:09:14.958 --> 00:09:19.958\na new hospital every 35 days.\n\n00:09:19.958 --> 00:09:22.958\nAnd 1298 Ambulances decided that it was going to\n\n00:09:22.958 --> 00:09:25.958\nreinvent a completely broken industry,\n\n00:09:25.958 --> 00:09:27.958\nbuilding an ambulance service in Bombay\n\n00:09:27.958 --> 00:09:30.958\nthat would use the technology of Google Earth,\n\n00:09:30.958 --> 00:09:32.958\na sliding scale pricing system\n\n00:09:32.958 --> 00:09:34.958\nso that all people could have access,\n\n00:09:34.958 --> 00:09:37.958\nand a severe and public decision\n\n00:09:37.958 --> 00:09:40.958\nnot to engage in any form of corruption.\n\n00:09:40.958 --> 00:09:42.958\nSo that in the terrorist attacks of November\n\n00:09:42.958 --> 00:09:44.958\nthey were the first responder,\n\n00:09:44.958 --> 00:09:46.958\nand are now beginning to scale, because of partnership.\n\n00:09:46.958 --> 00:09:50.958\nThey've just won four government contracts to build off their 100 ambulances,\n\n00:09:50.958 --> 00:09:54.958\nand are one of the largest and most effective ambulance companies\n\n00:09:54.958 --> 00:09:56.958\nin India.\n\n00:09:56.958 --> 00:09:58.958\nThis idea of scale is critical.\n\n00:09:58.958 --> 00:10:00.958\nBecause we're starting to see these enterprises\n\n00:10:00.958 --> 00:10:03.958\nreach hundreds of thousands of people. All of the ones I discussed\n\n00:10:03.958 --> 00:10:05.958\nhave reached at least a quarter million people.\n\n00:10:05.958 --> 00:10:07.958\nBut that's obviously not enough.\n\n00:10:07.958 --> 00:10:09.958\nAnd it's where the idea of partnership\n\n00:10:09.958 --> 00:10:11.958\nbecomes so important.\n\n00:10:11.958 --> 00:10:13.958\nWhether it's by finding those innovations\n\n00:10:13.958 --> 00:10:15.958\nthat can access the capital markets,\n\n00:10:15.958 --> 00:10:18.958\ngovernment itself, or partner with major corporations,\n\n00:10:18.958 --> 00:10:22.958\nthere is unbelievable opportunity for innovation.\n\n00:10:22.958 --> 00:10:24.958\nPresident Obama understands that.\n\n00:10:24.958 --> 00:10:27.958\nHe recently authorized the creation of a Social Innovation Fund\n\n00:10:27.958 --> 00:10:29.958\nto focus on what works in this country,\n\n00:10:29.958 --> 00:10:31.958\nand look at how we can scale it.\n\n00:10:31.958 --> 00:10:34.958\nAnd I would submit that it's time to consider\n\n00:10:34.958 --> 00:10:36.958\na global innovation fund\n\n00:10:36.958 --> 00:10:39.958\nthat would find these entrepreneurs around the world\n\n00:10:39.958 --> 00:10:41.958\nwho really have innovations, not only for their country,\n\n00:10:41.958 --> 00:10:44.958\nbut ones that we can use in the developed world as well.\n\n00:10:44.958 --> 00:10:48.958\nInvest financial assistance, but also management assistance.\n\n00:10:48.958 --> 00:10:50.958\nAnd then measure the returns,\n\n00:10:50.958 --> 00:10:52.958\nboth from a financial perspective\n\n00:10:52.958 --> 00:10:55.958\nand from a social impact perspective.\n\n00:10:55.958 --> 00:10:58.958\nWhen we think about new approaches to aid,\n\n00:10:58.958 --> 00:11:02.958\nit's impossible not to talk about Pakistan.\n\n00:11:02.958 --> 00:11:04.958\nWe've had a rocky relationship with that country\n\n00:11:04.958 --> 00:11:06.958\nand, in all fairness,\n\n00:11:06.958 --> 00:11:09.958\nthe United States has not always been a very reliable partner.\n\n00:11:09.958 --> 00:11:13.958\nBut again I would say that this is our moment\n\n00:11:13.958 --> 00:11:15.958\nfor extraordinary things to happen.\n\n00:11:15.958 --> 00:11:18.958\nAnd if we take that notion of a global innovation fund,\n\n00:11:18.958 --> 00:11:21.958\nwe could use this time to invest\n\n00:11:21.958 --> 00:11:24.958\nnot directly in government, though we would have government's blessing,\n\n00:11:24.958 --> 00:11:27.958\nnor in international experts,\n\n00:11:27.958 --> 00:11:30.958\nbut in the many existing entrepreneurs\n\n00:11:30.958 --> 00:11:32.958\nand civil society leaders\n\n00:11:32.958 --> 00:11:36.958\nwho already are building wonderful innovations\n\n00:11:36.958 --> 00:11:38.958\nthat are reaching people all across the country.\n\n00:11:38.958 --> 00:11:40.958\nPeople like Rashani Zafar,\n\n00:11:40.958 --> 00:11:43.958\nwho created one of the largest microfinance banks in the country,\n\n00:11:43.958 --> 00:11:47.958\nand is a real role model for women inside and outside the country.\n\n00:11:47.958 --> 00:11:49.958\nAnd Tasneem Siddiqui, who developed a way\n\n00:11:49.958 --> 00:11:51.958\ncalled incremental housing,\n\n00:11:51.958 --> 00:11:53.958\nwhere he has moved 40,000 slum dwellers\n\n00:11:53.958 --> 00:11:56.958\ninto safe, affordable community housing.\n\n00:11:56.958 --> 00:11:59.958\nEducational initiatives like DIL and The Citizen Foundation\n\n00:11:59.958 --> 00:12:02.958\nthat are building schools across the country.\n\n00:12:02.958 --> 00:12:04.958\nIt's not hyperbole\n\n00:12:04.958 --> 00:12:06.958\nto say that these civil society institutions\n\n00:12:06.958 --> 00:12:08.958\nand these social entrepreneurs\n\n00:12:08.958 --> 00:12:11.958\nare building real alternatives to the Taliban.\n\n00:12:11.958 --> 00:12:14.958\nI've invested in Pakistan for over seven years now,\n\n00:12:14.958 --> 00:12:16.958\nand those of you who've also worked there\n\n00:12:16.958 --> 00:12:20.958\ncan attest that Pakistanis are an incredibly hard working population,\n\n00:12:20.958 --> 00:12:25.958\nand there is a fierce upward mobility in their very nature.\n\n00:12:25.958 --> 00:12:27.958\nPresident Kennedy said that\n\n00:12:27.958 --> 00:12:31.958\nthose who make peaceful revolution impossible\n\n00:12:31.958 --> 00:12:34.958\nmake violent revolution inevitable.\n\n00:12:34.958 --> 00:12:36.958\nI would say that the converse is true.\n\n00:12:36.958 --> 00:12:38.958\nThat these social leaders\n\n00:12:38.958 --> 00:12:40.958\nwho really are looking at innovation\n\n00:12:40.958 --> 00:12:42.958\nand extending opportunity\n\n00:12:42.958 --> 00:12:45.958\nto the 70 percent of Pakistanis who make less than two dollars a day,\n\n00:12:45.958 --> 00:12:48.958\nprovide real pathways to hope.\n\n00:12:48.958 --> 00:12:51.958\nAnd as we think about how we construct aid for Pakistan,\n\n00:12:51.958 --> 00:12:54.958\nwhile we need to strengthen the judiciary,\n\n00:12:54.958 --> 00:12:56.958\nbuild greater stability,\n\n00:12:56.958 --> 00:12:59.958\nwe also need to think about lifting those leaders\n\n00:12:59.958 --> 00:13:03.958\nwho can be role models for the rest of the world.\n\n00:13:03.958 --> 00:13:05.958\nOn one of my last visits to Pakistan,\n\n00:13:05.958 --> 00:13:07.958\nI asked Dr. Sono if he would take me\n\n00:13:07.958 --> 00:13:10.958\nto see some of the drip irrigation in the Thar Desert.\n\n00:13:10.958 --> 00:13:13.958\nAnd we left Karachi one morning before dawn.\n\n00:13:13.958 --> 00:13:15.958\nIt was about 115 degrees.\n\n00:13:15.958 --> 00:13:17.958\nAnd we drove for eight hours\n\n00:13:17.958 --> 00:13:20.958\nalong this moonscape-like landscape\n\n00:13:20.958 --> 00:13:23.958\nwith very little color, lots of heat,\n\n00:13:23.958 --> 00:13:25.958\nvery little discussion, because we were exhausted.\n\n00:13:25.958 --> 00:13:27.958\nAnd finally, at the end of the journey,\n\n00:13:27.958 --> 00:13:31.958\nI could see this thin little yellow line across the horizon.\n\n00:13:31.958 --> 00:13:34.958\nAnd as we got closer, its significance became apparent.\n\n00:13:34.958 --> 00:13:36.958\nThat there in the desert\n\n00:13:36.958 --> 00:13:39.958\nwas a field of sunflowers growing seven feet tall.\n\n00:13:39.958 --> 00:13:41.958\nBecause one of the poorest farmers on Earth\n\n00:13:41.958 --> 00:13:44.958\nhad gotten access to a technology\n\n00:13:44.958 --> 00:13:47.958\nthat had allowed him to change his own life.\n\n00:13:47.958 --> 00:13:49.958\nHis name was Raja,\n\n00:13:49.958 --> 00:13:51.958\nand he had kind, twinkly hazel eyes\n\n00:13:51.958 --> 00:13:54.958\nand warm expressive hands\n\n00:13:54.958 --> 00:13:56.958\nthat reminded me of my father.\n\n00:13:56.958 --> 00:13:58.958\nAnd he said it was the first dry season\n\n00:13:58.958 --> 00:14:01.958\nin his entire life that he hadn't taken\n\n00:14:01.958 --> 00:14:03.958\nhis 12 children and 50 grandchildren\n\n00:14:03.958 --> 00:14:06.958\non a two day journey across the desert\n\n00:14:06.958 --> 00:14:08.958\nto work as day laborers at a commercial farm\n\n00:14:08.958 --> 00:14:10.958\nfor about 50 cents a day.\n\n00:14:10.958 --> 00:14:12.958\nBecause he was building these crops.\n\n00:14:12.958 --> 00:14:15.958\nAnd with the money he earned he could stay this year.\n\n00:14:15.958 --> 00:14:18.958\nAnd for the first time ever in three generations,\n\n00:14:18.958 --> 00:14:21.958\nhis children would go to school.\n\n00:14:21.958 --> 00:14:24.958\nWe asked him if he would send his daughters as well as his sons.\n\n00:14:24.958 --> 00:14:26.958\nAnd he said, \"Of course I will.\n\n00:14:26.958 --> 00:14:31.958\nBecause I don't want them discriminated against anymore.\"\n\n00:14:31.958 --> 00:14:33.958\nWhen we think about solutions to poverty,\n\n00:14:33.958 --> 00:14:35.958\nwe cannot deny individuals\n\n00:14:35.958 --> 00:14:37.958\ntheir fundamental dignity.\n\n00:14:37.958 --> 00:14:39.958\nBecause at the end of the day,\n\n00:14:39.958 --> 00:14:42.958\ndignity is more important to the human spirit than wealth.\n\n00:14:42.958 --> 00:14:46.958\nAnd what's exciting is to see so many entrepreneurs across sectors\n\n00:14:46.958 --> 00:14:49.958\nwho are building innovations that recognize\n\n00:14:49.958 --> 00:14:51.958\nthat what people want is freedom\n\n00:14:51.958 --> 00:14:53.958\nand choice and opportunity.\n\n00:14:53.958 --> 00:14:56.958\nBecause that is where dignity really starts.\n\n00:14:56.958 --> 00:14:58.958\nMartin Luther King said that\n\n00:14:58.958 --> 00:15:03.958\nlove without power is anemic and sentimental,\n\n00:15:03.958 --> 00:15:05.958\nand that power without love\n\n00:15:05.958 --> 00:15:07.958\nis reckless and abusive.\n\n00:15:07.958 --> 00:15:10.958\nOur generation has seen both approaches tried,\n\n00:15:10.958 --> 00:15:12.958\nand often fail.\n\n00:15:12.958 --> 00:15:15.958\nBut I think our generation also might be the first\n\n00:15:15.958 --> 00:15:19.958\nto have the courage to embrace both love and power.\n\n00:15:19.958 --> 00:15:22.958\nFor that is what we'll need, as we move forward\n\n00:15:22.958 --> 00:15:25.958\nto dream and imagine what it will really take\n\n00:15:25.958 --> 00:15:28.958\nto build a global economy that includes all of us,\n\n00:15:28.958 --> 00:15:31.958\nand to finally extend that fundamental proposition\n\n00:15:31.958 --> 00:15:35.958\nthat all men are created equal to every human being on the planet.\n\n00:15:35.958 --> 00:15:38.958\nThe time for us to begin innovating\n\n00:15:38.958 --> 00:15:42.958\nand looking for new solutions, a cross sector, is now.\n\n00:15:42.958 --> 00:15:44.958\nI can only talk from my own experience,\n\n00:15:44.958 --> 00:15:48.958\nbut in eight years of running Acumen fund,\n\n00:15:48.958 --> 00:15:50.958\nI've seen the power of patient capital.\n\n00:15:50.958 --> 00:15:55.958\nNot only to inspire innovation and risk taking,\n\n00:15:55.958 --> 00:15:57.958\nbut to truly build systems that have created\n\n00:15:57.958 --> 00:15:59.958\nmore than 25,000 jobs\n\n00:15:59.958 --> 00:16:02.958\nand delivered tens of millions of services and products\n\n00:16:02.958 --> 00:16:05.958\nto some of the poorest people on the planet.\n\n00:16:05.958 --> 00:16:07.958\nI know it works.\n\n00:16:07.958 --> 00:16:10.958\nBut I know that many other kinds of innovation also work.\n\n00:16:10.958 --> 00:16:13.958\nAnd so I urge you, in whatever sector you work,\n\n00:16:13.958 --> 00:16:15.958\nin whatever job you do,\n\n00:16:15.958 --> 00:16:17.958\nto start thinking about how we might\n\n00:16:17.958 --> 00:16:20.958\nbuild solutions that start\n\n00:16:20.958 --> 00:16:22.958\nfrom the perspective of those we're trying to help.\n\n00:16:22.958 --> 00:16:27.958\nRather than what we think that they might need.\n\n00:16:27.958 --> 00:16:30.958\nIt will take embracing the world with both arms.\n\n00:16:30.958 --> 00:16:35.958\nAnd it will take living with the spirit of generosity and accountability,\n\n00:16:35.958 --> 00:16:39.958\nwith a sense of integrity and perseverance.\n\n00:16:39.958 --> 00:16:41.958\nAnd yet these are the very qualities\n\n00:16:41.958 --> 00:16:43.958\nfor which men and women have been honored\n\n00:16:43.958 --> 00:16:45.958\nthroughout the generations.\n\n00:16:45.958 --> 00:16:48.958\nAnd there is so much good that we can do.\n\n00:16:48.958 --> 00:16:51.958\nJust think of all those sunflowers in the desert.\n\n00:16:51.958 -->

Before you answer that, have a look at this map. Contemporary political map shows that we have over 200 countries in the world today. That's probably more than at any time in centuries. Now, many of you will object. For you this would be a more appropriate map. You could call it TEDistan. In TEDistan, there are no borders, just connected spaces and unconnected spaces. Most of you probably reside in one of the 40 dots on this screen, of the many more that represent 90 percent of the world economy.But let's talk about the 90 percent of the world population that will never leave the place in which they were born. For them, nations, countries, boundaries, borders still matter a great deal, and often violently. Now here at TED, we're solving some of the great riddles of science and mysteries of the universe. Well here is a fundamental problem we have not solved: our basic political geography. How do we distribute ourselves around the world?Now this is important, because border conflicts justify so much of the world's military-industrial complex. Border conflicts can derail so much of the progress that we hope to achieve here. So I think we need a deeper understanding of how people, money, power, religion, culture, technology interact to change the map of the world. And we can try to anticipate those changes, and shape them in a more constructive direction.So we're going to look at some maps of the past, the present and some maps you haven't seen in order to get a sense of where things are going. Let's start with the world of 1945. 1945 there were just 100 countries in the world. After World War II, Europe was devastated, but still held large overseas colonies: French West Africa, British East Africa, South Asia, and so forth. Then over the late '40s, '50s, '60s, '70s and '80s, waves of decolonization took place. Over 50 new countries were born. You can see that Africa has been fragmented. India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, South East Asian nations created. Then came the end of the Cold War. The end of the Cold War and the disintegration of the Soviet Union. You had the creation of new states in Eastern Europe, the former Yugoslav republics and the Balkans, and the 'stans of central Asia.Today we have 200 countries in the world. The entire planet is covered by sovereign, independent nation-states. Does that mean that someone's gain has to be someone else's loss? Let's zoom in on one of the most strategic areas of the world, Eastern Eurasia. As you can see on this map, Russia is still the largest country in the world. And as you know, China is the most populous. And they share a lengthy land border.What you don't see on this map is that most of Russia's 150 million people are concentrated in its western provinces and areas that are close to Europe. And only 30 million people are in its eastern areas. In fact, the World Bank predicts that Russia's population is declining towards about 120 million peopleAnd there is another thing that you don't see on this map. Stalin, Khrushchev and other Soviet leaders forced Russians out to the far east to be in gulags, labor camps, nuclear cities, whatever the case was. But as oil prices rose, Russian governments have invested in infrastructure to unite the country, east and west. But nothing has more perversely impacted Russia's demographic distribution, because the people in the east, who never wanted to be there anyway, have gotten on those trains and roads and gone back to the west. As a result, in the Russian far east today, which is twice the size of India, you have exactly six million Russians.So let's get a sense of what is happening in this part of the world. We can start with Mongolia, or as some call it, Mine-golia. Why do they call it that? Because in Mine-golia, Chinese firms operate and own most of the mines \u2014 copper, zinc, gold \u2014 and they truck the resources south and east into mainland China. China isn't conquering Mongolia. It's buying it. Colonies were once conquered. Today countries are bought.So let's apply this principle to Siberia. Siberia most of you probably think of as a cold, desolate, unlivable place. But in fact, with global warming and rising temperatures, all of a sudden you have vast wheat fields and agribusiness, and grain being produced in Siberia. But who is it going to feed? Well, just on the other side of the Amo River, in the Heilongjiang and Harbin provinces of China, you have over 100 million people. That's larger than the entire population of Russia.Every single year, for at least a decade or more, [60,000] of them have been voting with their feet, crossing, moving north and inhabiting this desolate terrain. They set up their own bazaars and medical clinics. They've taken over the timber industry and been shipping the lumber east, back into China. Again, like Mongolia, China isn't conquering Russia. It's just leasing it. That's what I call globalization Chinese style.Now maybe this is what the map of the region might look like in 10 to 20 years. But hold on. This map is 700 years old. This is the map of the Yuan Dynasty, led by Kublai Khan, the grandson of Genghis Khan. So history doesn't necessarily repeat itself, but it does rhyme.This is just to give you a taste of what's happening in this part of the world. Again, globalization Chinese style. Because globalization opens up all kinds of ways for us to undermine and change the way we think about political geography. So, the history of East Asia in fact, people don't think about nations and borders. They think more in terms of empires and hierarchies, usually Chinese or Japanese.Well it's China's turn again. So let's look at how China is re-establishing that hierarchy in the far East. It starts with the global hubs. Remember the 40 dots on the nighttime map that show the hubs of the global economy? East Asia today has more of those global hubs than any other region in the world. Tokyo, Seoul, Beijing, Shanghai, Hong Kong, Singapore and Sidney. These are the filters and funnels of global capital. Trillions of dollars a year are being brought into the region, so much of it being invested into China.Then there is trade. These vectors and arrows represent ever stronger trade relationships that China has with every country in the region. Specifically, it targets Japan and Korea and Australia, countries that are strong allies of the United States. Australia, for example, is heavily dependent on exporting iron ore and natural gas to China. For poorer countries, China reduces tariffs so that Laos and Cambodia can sell their goods more cheaply and become dependent on exporting to China as well.And now many of you have been reading in the news how people are looking to China to lead the rebound, the economic rebound, not just in Asia, but potentially for the world. The Asian free trade zone, almost free trade zone, that's emerging now has a greater trade volume than trade across the Pacific. So China is becoming the anchor of the economy in the region.Another pillar of this strategy is diplomacy. China has signed military agreements with many countries in the region. It has become the hub of diplomatic institutions such as the East Asian Community. Some of these organizations don't even have the United States as a member. There is a treaty of nonaggression between countries, such that if there were a conflict between China and the United States, most countries vow to just sit it out, including American allies like Korea and Australia.Another pillar of the strategy, like Russia, is demographic. China exports business people, nannies, students, teachers to teach Chinese around the region, to intermarry and to occupy ever greater commanding heights of the economies. Already ethnic Chinese people in Malaysia, Thailand and Indonesia are the real key factors and drivers in the economies there. Chinese pride is resurgent in the region as a result. Singapore, for example, used to ban Chinese language education. Now it encourages it.If you add it all up what do you get? Well, if you remember before World War II, Japan had a vision for a greater Japanese co-prosperity sphere. What's emerging today is what you might call a greater Chinese co-prosperity sphere. So no matter what the lines on the map tell you in terms of nations and borders, what you really have emerging in the far east are national cultures, but in a much more fluid, imperial zone. All of this is happening without firing a shot.That's most certainly not the case in the Middle East where countries are still very uncomfortable in the borders left behind by European colonialists. So what can we do to think about borders differently in this part of the world? What lines on the map should we focus on? What I want to present to you is what I call state building, day by day.Let's start with Iraq. Six years after the U.S. invasion of Iraq, the country still exists more on a map than it does in reality. Oil used to be one of the forces holding Iraq together; now it is the most significant cause of the country's disintegration. The reason is Kurdistan. The Kurds for 3,000 years have been waging a struggle for independence, and now is their chance to finally have it. These are pipeline routes, which emerge from Kurdistan, which is an oil-rich region.And today, if you go to Kurdistan, you'll see that Kurdish Peshmerga guerillas are squaring off against the Sunni Iraqi army. But what are they guarding? Is it really a border on the map? No. It's the pipelines. If the Kurds can control their pipelines, they can set the terms of their own statehood. Now should we be upset about this, about the potential disintegration of Iraq? I don't believe we should. Iraq will still be the second largest oil producer in the world, behind Saudi Arabia. And we'll have a chance to solve a 3,000 year old dispute. Now remember Kurdistan is landlocked. It has no choice but to behave. In order to profit from its oil it has to export it through Turkey or Syria, and other countries, and Iraq itself. And therefore it has to have amicable relations with them.Now lets look at a perennial conflict in the region. That is, of course, in Palestine. Palestine is something of a cartographic anomaly because it's two parts Palestinian, one part Israel. 30 years of rose garden diplomacy have not delivered us peace in this conflict. What might? I believe that what might solve the problem is infrastructure. Today donors are spending billions of dollars on this. These two arrows are an arc, an arc of commuter railroads and other infrastructure that link the West Bank and Gaza.If Gaza can have a functioning port and be linked to the West Bank, you can have a viable Palestinian state, Palestinian economy. That, I believe, is going to bring peace to this particular conflict. The lesson from Kurdistan and from Palestine is that independence alone, without infrastructure, is futile.Now what might this entire region look like if in fact we focus on other lines on the map besides borders, when the insecurities might abate? The last time that was the case was actually a century ago, during the Ottoman Empire. This is the Hejaz Railway. The Hejaz Railway ran from Istanbul to Medina via Damascus. It even had an offshoot running to Haifa in what is today Israel, on the Mediterranean Sea. But today the Hejaz Railway lies in tatters, ruins. If we were to focus on reconstructing these curvy lines on the map, infrastructure, that cross the straight lines, the borders, I believe the Middle East would be a far more peaceful region.Now let's look at another part of the world, the former Soviet Republics of Central Asia, the 'stans. These countries' borders originate from Stalin's decrees. He purposely did not want these countries to make sense. He wanted ethnicities to mingle in ways that would allow him to divide and rule. Fortunately for them, most of their oil and gas resources were discovered after the Soviet Union collapsed.Now I know some of you may be thinking, \"Oil, oil, oil. Why is it all he's talking about is oil?\" Well, there is a big difference in the way we used to talk about oil and the way we're talking about it now. Before it was, how do we control their oil? Now it's their oil for their own purposes. And I assure you it's every bit as important to them as it might have been to colonizers and imperialists. Here are just some of the pipeline projections and possibilities and scenarios and routes that are being mapped out for the next several decades. A great deal of them.For a number of countries in this part of the world, having pipelines is the ticket to becoming part of the global economy and for having some meaning besides the borders that they are not loyal to themselves. Just take Azerbaijan. Azerbaijan was a forgotten corner of the Caucuses, but now with the Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan pipeline into Turkey, it has rebranded itself as the frontier of the west.Then there is Turkmenistan, which most people think of as a frozen basket case. But now it's contributing gas across the Caspian Sea to provide for Europe, and even a potentially Turkmen- Afghan-Pakistan-India pipeline as well.Then there is Kazakhstan, which didn't even have a name before. It was more considered South Siberia during the Soviet Union. Today most people recognize Kazakhstan as an emerging geopolitical player. Why? Because it has shrewdly designed pipelines to flow across the Caspian, north through Russia, and even east to China. More pipelines means more silk roads, instead of the Great Game. The Great Game connotes dominance of one over the other. Silk road connotes independence and mutual trust. The more pipelines we have, the more silk roads we'll have, and the less of a dominant Great Game competition we'll have in the 21st century.Now let's look at the only part of the world that really has brought down its borders, and how that has enhanced its strength. And that is, of course, Europe. The European Union began as just the coal and steel community of six countries, and their main purpose was really to keep the rehabilitation of Germany to happen in a peaceful way. But then eventually it grew into 12 countries, and those are the 12 stars on the European flag. The E.U. also became a currency block, and is now the most powerful trade block in the entire world. On average, the E.U. has grown by one country per year since the end of the Cold War. In fact most of that happened on just one day. In 2004, 15 new countries joined the E.U. and now you have what most people consider a zone of peace spanning 27 countries and 450 million people.So what is next? What is the future of the European Union? Well in light blue, you see the zones or the regions that are at least two-thirds or more dependent on the European Union for trade and investment. What does that tell us? Trade and investment tell us that Europe is putting its money where its mouth is. Even if these regions aren't part of the E.U., they are becoming part of its sphere of influence. Just take the Balkans. Croatia, Serbia Bosnia, they're not members of the E.U. yet. But you can get on a German ICE train and make it almost to Albania. In Bosnia you use the Euro currency already, and that's the only currency they're probably ever going to have.So, looking at other parts of Europe's periphery, such as North Africa. On average, every year or two, a new oil or gas pipeline opens up under the Mediterranean, connecting North Africa to Europe. That not only helps Europe diminish its reliance on Russia for energy, but if you travel to North Africa today, you'll hear more and more people saying that they don't really think of their region as the Middle East. So in other words, I believe that President Sarkozy of France is right when he talks about a Mediterranean union.Now let's look at Turkey and the Caucasus. I mentioned Azerbaijan before. That corridor of Turkey and the Caucasus has become the conduit for 20 percent of Europe's energy supply. So does Turkey really have to be a member of the European Union? I don't think it does. I think it's already part of a Euro-Turkish superpower.So what's next? Where are we going to see borders change and new countries born? Well, South Central Asia, South West Asia is a very good place to start. Eight years after the U.S. invaded Afghanistan there is still a tremendous amount of instability. Pakistan and Afghanistan are still so fragile that neither of them have dealt constructively with the problem of Pashtun nationalism. This is the flag that flies in the minds of 20 million Pashtuns who live on both sides of the Afghan and Pakistan border.Let's not neglect the insurgency just to the south, Balochistan. Two weeks ago, Balochi rebels attacked a Pakistani military garrison, and this was the flag that they raised over it. The post-colonial entropy that is happening around the world is accelerating, and I expect more such changes to occur in the map as the states fragment.Of course, we can't forget Africa. 53 countries, and by far the most number of suspiciously straight lines on the map. If we were to look at all of Africa we could most certainly acknowledge far more, tribal divisions and so forth. But let's just look at Sudan, the second-largest country in Africa. It has three ongoing civil wars, the genocide in Darfur, which you all know about, the civil war in the east of the country, and south Sudan. South Sudan is going to be having a referendum in 2011 in which it is very likely to vote itself independence.Now let's go up to the Arctic Circle. There is a great race on for energy resources under the Arctic seabed. Who will win? Canada? Russia? The United States? Actually Greenland. Several weeks ago Greenland's [60,000] people voted themselves self-governance rights from Denmark. So Denmark is about to get a whole lot smaller.What is the lesson from all of this? Geopolitics is a very unsentimental discipline. It's constantly morphing and changing the world, like climate change. And like our relationship with the ecosystem we're always searching for equilibrium in how we divide ourselves across the planet. Now we fear changes on the map. We fear civil wars, death tolls, having to learn the names of new countries. But I believe that the inertia of the existing borders that we have today is far worse and far more violent.The question is how do we change those borders, and what lines do we focus on? I believe we focus on the lines that cross borders, the infrastructure lines. Then we'll wind up with the world we want, a borderless one. Thank you.

million people are in its eastern areas.\n\n00:03:10.958 --> 00:03:12.958\nIn fact, the World Bank predicts\n\n00:03:12.958 --> 00:03:14.958\nthat Russia's population is declining\n\n00:03:14.958 --> 00:03:17.958\ntowards about 120 million people\n\n00:03:17.958 --> 00:03:19.958\nAnd there is another thing that you don't see on this map.\n\n00:03:19.958 --> 00:03:22.958\nStalin, Khrushchev and other Soviet leaders\n\n00:03:22.958 --> 00:03:24.958\nforced Russians out to the far east\n\n00:03:24.958 --> 00:03:26.958\nto be in gulags, labor camps,\n\n00:03:26.958 --> 00:03:29.958\nnuclear cities, whatever the case was.\n\n00:03:29.958 --> 00:03:31.958\nBut as oil prices rose,\n\n00:03:31.958 --> 00:03:33.958\nRussian governments have invested in infrastructure\n\n00:03:33.958 --> 00:03:35.958\nto unite the country, east and west.\n\n00:03:35.958 --> 00:03:38.958\nBut nothing has more perversely impacted\n\n00:03:38.958 --> 00:03:40.958\nRussia's demographic distribution,\n\n00:03:40.958 --> 00:03:43.958\nbecause the people in the east, who never wanted to be there anyway,\n\n00:03:43.958 --> 00:03:45.958\nhave gotten on those trains and roads\n\n00:03:45.958 --> 00:03:47.958\nand gone back to the west.\n\n00:03:47.958 --> 00:03:50.958\nAs a result, in the Russian far east today,\n\n00:03:50.958 --> 00:03:52.958\nwhich is twice the size of India,\n\n00:03:52.958 --> 00:03:55.958\nyou have exactly six million Russians.\n\n00:03:55.958 --> 00:03:58.958\nSo let's get a sense of what is happening in this part of the world.\n\n00:03:58.958 --> 00:04:01.958\nWe can start with Mongolia, or as some call it, Mine-golia.\n\n00:04:01.958 --> 00:04:03.958\nWhy do they call it that?\n\n00:04:03.958 --> 00:04:06.958\nBecause in Mine-golia, Chinese firms operate\n\n00:04:06.958 --> 00:04:09.958\nand own most of the mines -- copper, zinc, gold --\n\n00:04:09.958 --> 00:04:13.958\nand they truck the resources south and east into mainland China.\n\n00:04:13.958 --> 00:04:15.958\nChina isn't conquering Mongolia.\n\n00:04:15.958 --> 00:04:18.958\nIt's buying it.\n\n00:04:18.958 --> 00:04:21.958\nColonies were once conquered. Today countries are bought.\n\n00:04:21.958 --> 00:04:25.958\nSo let's apply this principle to Siberia.\n\n00:04:25.958 --> 00:04:27.958\nSiberia most of you probably think of\n\n00:04:27.958 --> 00:04:30.958\nas a cold, desolate, unlivable place.\n\n00:04:30.958 --> 00:04:33.958\nBut in fact, with global warming and rising temperatures,\n\n00:04:33.958 --> 00:04:35.958\nall of a sudden you have vast wheat fields\n\n00:04:35.958 --> 00:04:39.958\nand agribusiness, and grain being produced in Siberia.\n\n00:04:39.958 --> 00:04:41.958\nBut who is it going to feed?\n\n00:04:41.958 --> 00:04:44.958\nWell, just on the other side of the Amo River,\n\n00:04:44.958 --> 00:04:47.958\nin the Heilongjiang and Harbin provinces of China,\n\n00:04:47.958 --> 00:04:49.958\nyou have over 100 million people.\n\n00:04:49.958 --> 00:04:52.958\nThat's larger than the entire population of Russia.\n\n00:04:52.958 --> 00:04:55.958\nEvery single year, for at least a decade or more,\n\n00:04:55.958 --> 00:04:58.958\n[60,000] of them have been voting with their feet,\n\n00:04:58.958 --> 00:05:03.958\ncrossing, moving north and inhabiting this desolate terrain.\n\n00:05:03.958 --> 00:05:05.958\nThey set up their own bazaars and medical clinics.\n\n00:05:05.958 --> 00:05:07.958\nThey've taken over the timber industry\n\n00:05:07.958 --> 00:05:10.958\nand been shipping the lumber east, back into China.\n\n00:05:10.958 --> 00:05:12.958\nAgain, like Mongolia,\n\n00:05:12.958 --> 00:05:16.958\nChina isn't conquering Russia. It's just leasing it.\n\n00:05:16.958 --> 00:05:20.958\nThat's what I call globalization Chinese style.\n\n00:05:20.958 --> 00:05:22.958\nNow maybe this is what the map of the region\n\n00:05:22.958 --> 00:05:24.958\nmight look like in 10 to 20 years.\n\n00:05:24.958 --> 00:05:28.958\nBut hold on. This map is 700 years old.\n\n00:05:28.958 --> 00:05:30.958\nThis is the map of the Yuan Dynasty,\n\n00:05:30.958 --> 00:05:34.958\nled by Kublai Khan, the grandson of Genghis Khan.\n\n00:05:34.958 --> 00:05:36.958\nSo history doesn't necessarily repeat itself,\n\n00:05:36.958 --> 00:05:38.958\nbut it does rhyme.\n\n00:05:38.958 --> 00:05:42.958\nThis is just to give you a taste of what's happening in this part of the world.\n\n00:05:42.958 --> 00:05:44.958\nAgain, globalization Chinese style.\n\n00:05:44.958 --> 00:05:47.958\nBecause globalization opens up all kinds of ways for us to\n\n00:05:47.958 --> 00:05:52.958\nundermine and change the way we think about political geography.\n\n00:05:52.958 --> 00:05:55.958\nSo, the history of East Asia in fact,\n\n00:05:55.958 --> 00:05:57.958\npeople don't think about nations and borders.\n\n00:05:57.958 --> 00:06:00.958\nThey think more in terms of empires and hierarchies,\n\n00:06:00.958 --> 00:06:02.958\nusually Chinese or Japanese.\n\n00:06:02.958 --> 00:06:04.958\nWell it's China's turn again.\n\n00:06:04.958 --> 00:06:06.958\nSo let's look at how China is re-establishing\n\n00:06:06.958 --> 00:06:08.958\nthat hierarchy in the far East.\n\n00:06:08.958 --> 00:06:10.958\nIt starts with the global hubs.\n\n00:06:10.958 --> 00:06:13.958\nRemember the 40 dots on the nighttime map\n\n00:06:13.958 --> 00:06:15.958\nthat show the hubs of the global economy?\n\n00:06:15.958 --> 00:06:17.958\nEast Asia today has more of those global hubs\n\n00:06:17.958 --> 00:06:19.958\nthan any other region in the world.\n\n00:06:19.958 --> 00:06:22.958\nTokyo, Seoul, Beijing, Shanghai,\n\n00:06:22.958 --> 00:06:25.958\nHong Kong, Singapore and Sidney.\n\n00:06:25.958 --> 00:06:27.958\nThese are the filters and funnels of global capital.\n\n00:06:27.958 --> 00:06:30.958\nTrillions of dollars a year are being brought into the region,\n\n00:06:30.958 --> 00:06:33.958\nso much of it being invested into China.\n\n00:06:33.958 --> 00:06:35.958\nThen there is trade.\n\n00:06:35.958 --> 00:06:37.958\nThese vectors and arrows represent ever stronger\n\n00:06:37.958 --> 00:06:39.958\ntrade relationships that China has\n\n00:06:39.958 --> 00:06:41.958\nwith every country in the region.\n\n00:06:41.958 --> 00:06:43.958\nSpecifically, it targets Japan\n\n00:06:43.958 --> 00:06:45.958\nand Korea and Australia,\n\n00:06:45.958 --> 00:06:47.958\ncountries that are strong allies of the United States.\n\n00:06:47.958 --> 00:06:49.958\nAustralia, for example, is heavily dependent\n\n00:06:49.958 --> 00:06:53.958\non exporting iron ore and natural gas to China.\n\n00:06:53.958 --> 00:06:56.958\nFor poorer countries, China reduces tariffs\n\n00:06:56.958 --> 00:06:59.958\nso that Laos and Cambodia can sell their goods more cheaply\n\n00:06:59.958 --> 00:07:02.958\nand become dependent on exporting to China as well.\n\n00:07:02.958 --> 00:07:04.958\nAnd now many of you have been reading in the news\n\n00:07:04.958 --> 00:07:06.958\nhow people are looking to China\n\n00:07:06.958 --> 00:07:11.958\nto lead the rebound, the economic rebound, not just in Asia, but potentially for the world.\n\n00:07:11.958 --> 00:07:15.958\nThe Asian free trade zone, almost free trade zone, that's emerging\n\n00:07:15.958 --> 00:07:19.958\nnow has a greater trade volume than trade across the Pacific.\n\n00:07:19.958 --> 00:07:22.958\nSo China is becoming the anchor of the economy in the region.\n\n00:07:22.958 --> 00:07:25.958\nAnother pillar of this strategy is diplomacy.\n\n00:07:25.958 --> 00:07:29.958\nChina has signed military agreements with many countries in the region.\n\n00:07:29.958 --> 00:07:32.958\nIt has become the hub of diplomatic institutions\n\n00:07:32.958 --> 00:07:34.958\nsuch as the East Asian Community.\n\n00:07:34.958 --> 00:07:36.958\nSome of these organizations don't even have\n\n00:07:36.958 --> 00:07:38.958\nthe United States as a member.\n\n00:07:38.958 --> 00:07:40.958\nThere is a treaty of nonaggression between countries,\n\n00:07:40.958 --> 00:07:44.958\nsuch that if there were a conflict between China and the United States,\n\n00:07:44.958 --> 00:07:47.958\nmost countries vow to just sit it out,\n\n00:07:47.958 --> 00:07:50.958\nincluding American allies like Korea and Australia.\n\n00:07:50.958 --> 00:07:52.958\nAnother pillar of the strategy,\n\n00:07:52.958 --> 00:07:54.958\nlike Russia, is demographic.\n\n00:07:54.958 --> 00:07:57.958\nChina exports business people, nannies, students,\n\n00:07:57.958 --> 00:08:00.958\nteachers to teach Chinese around the region,\n\n00:08:00.958 --> 00:08:03.958\nto intermarry and to occupy ever greater\n\n00:08:03.958 --> 00:08:05.958\ncommanding heights of the economies.\n\n00:08:05.958 --> 00:08:07.958\nAlready ethnic Chinese people\n\n00:08:07.958 --> 00:08:10.958\nin Malaysia, Thailand and Indonesia\n\n00:08:10.958 --> 00:08:13.958\nare the real key factors and drivers\n\n00:08:13.958 --> 00:08:15.958\nin the economies there.\n\n00:08:15.958 --> 00:08:17.958\nChinese pride is resurgent in the region\n\n00:08:17.958 --> 00:08:19.958\nas a result.\n\n00:08:19.958 --> 00:08:22.958\nSingapore, for example, used to ban Chinese language education.\n\n00:08:22.958 --> 00:08:24.958\nNow it encourages it.\n\n00:08:24.958 --> 00:08:26.958\nIf you add it all up what do you get?\n\n00:08:26.958 --> 00:08:28.958\nWell, if you remember before World War II,\n\n00:08:28.958 --> 00:08:30.958\nJapan had a vision\n\n00:08:30.958 --> 00:08:33.958\nfor a greater Japanese co-prosperity sphere.\n\n00:08:33.958 --> 00:08:35.958\nWhat's emerging today is what you might call\n\n00:08:35.958 --> 00:08:38.958\na greater Chinese co-prosperity sphere.\n\n00:08:38.958 --> 00:08:40.958\nSo no matter what the lines on the map tell you\n\n00:08:40.958 --> 00:08:42.958\nin terms of nations and borders,\n\n00:08:42.958 --> 00:08:44.958\nwhat you really have emerging in the far east\n\n00:08:44.958 --> 00:08:46.958\nare national cultures,\n\n00:08:46.958 --> 00:08:49.958\nbut in a much more fluid, imperial zone.\n\n00:08:49.958 --> 00:08:52.958\nAll of this is happening without firing a shot.\n\n00:08:52.958 --> 00:08:55.958\nThat's most certainly not the case in the Middle East\n\n00:08:55.958 --> 00:08:58.958\nwhere countries are still very uncomfortable\n\n00:08:58.958 --> 00:09:01.958\nin the borders left behind by European colonialists.\n\n00:09:01.958 --> 00:09:05.958\nSo what can we do to think about borders differently in this part of the world?\n\n00:09:05.958 --> 00:09:07.958\nWhat lines on the map should we focus on?\n\n00:09:07.958 --> 00:09:09.958\nWhat I want to present to you is what I call\n\n00:09:09.958 --> 00:09:12.958\nstate building, day by day.\n\n00:09:12.958 --> 00:09:14.958\nLet's start with Iraq.\n\n00:09:14.958 --> 00:09:16.958\nSix years after the U.S. invasion of Iraq,\n\n00:09:16.958 --> 00:09:19.958\nthe country still exists more on a map than it does in reality.\n\n00:09:19.958 --> 00:09:22.958\nOil used to be one of the forces holding Iraq together;\n\n00:09:22.958 --> 00:09:26.958\nnow it is the most significant cause of the country's disintegration.\n\n00:09:26.958 --> 00:09:28.958\nThe reason is Kurdistan.\n\n00:09:28.958 --> 00:09:30.958\nThe Kurds for 3,000 years\n\n00:09:30.958 --> 00:09:32.958\nhave been waging a struggle for independence,\n\n00:09:32.958 --> 00:09:34.958\nand now is their chance to finally have it.\n\n00:09:34.958 --> 00:09:37.958\nThese are pipeline routes, which emerge from Kurdistan,\n\n00:09:37.958 --> 00:09:39.958\nwhich is an oil-rich region.\n\n00:09:39.958 --> 00:09:41.958\nAnd today, if you go to Kurdistan,\n\n00:09:41.958 --> 00:09:43.958\nyou'll see that Kurdish Peshmerga guerillas\n\n00:09:43.958 --> 00:09:46.958\nare squaring off against the Sunni Iraqi army.\n\n00:09:46.958 --> 00:09:48.958\nBut what are they guarding?\n\n00:09:48.958 --> 00:09:50.958\nIs it really a border on the map?\n\n00:09:50.958 --> 00:09:52.958\nNo. It's the pipelines.\n\n00:09:52.958 --> 00:09:54.958\nIf the Kurds can control their pipelines, they can set the terms\n\n00:09:54.958 --> 00:09:56.958\nof their own statehood.\n\n00:09:56.958 --> 00:09:59.958\nNow should we be upset about this, about the potential disintegration of Iraq?\n\n00:09:59.958 --> 00:10:01.958\nI don't believe we should.\n\n00:10:01.958 --> 00:10:04.958\nIraq will still be the second largest oil producer in the world,\n\n00:10:04.958 --> 00:10:06.958\nbehind Saudi Arabia.\n\n00:10:06.958 --> 00:10:09.958\nAnd we'll have a chance to solve a 3,000 year old dispute.\n\n00:10:09.958 --> 00:10:11.958\nNow remember Kurdistan is landlocked.\n\n00:10:11.958 --> 00:10:13.958\nIt has no choice but to behave.\n\n00:10:13.958 --> 00:10:15.958\nIn order to profit from its oil\n\n00:10:15.958 --> 00:10:18.958\nit has to export it through Turkey or Syria,\n\n00:10:18.958 --> 00:10:20.958\nand other countries, and Iraq itself.\n\n00:10:20.958 --> 00:10:23.958\nAnd therefore it has to have amicable relations with them.\n\n00:10:23.958 --> 00:10:26.958\nNow lets look at a perennial conflict in the region.\n\n00:10:26.958 --> 00:10:28.958\nThat is, of course, in Palestine.\n\n00:10:28.958 --> 00:10:32.958\nPalestine is something of a cartographic anomaly\n\n00:10:32.958 --> 00:10:35.958\nbecause it's two parts Palestinian, one part Israel.\n\n00:10:35.958 --> 00:10:37.958\n30 years of rose garden diplomacy\n\n00:10:37.958 --> 00:10:40.958\nhave not delivered us peace in this conflict.\n\n00:10:40.958 --> 00:10:43.958\nWhat might? I believe that what might\n\n00:10:43.958 --> 00:10:45.958\nsolve the problem is infrastructure.\n\n00:10:45.958 --> 00:10:48.958\nToday donors are spending billions of dollars on this.\n\n00:10:48.958 --> 00:10:50.958\nThese two arrows are an arc,\n\n00:10:50.958 --> 00:10:53.958\nan arc of commuter railroads and other infrastructure\n\n00:10:53.958 --> 00:10:56.958\nthat link the West Bank and Gaza.\n\n00:10:56.958 --> 00:10:58.958\nIf Gaza can have a functioning port\n\n00:10:58.958 --> 00:11:01.958\nand be linked to the West Bank, you can have a viable Palestinian state,\n\n00:11:01.958 --> 00:11:03.958\nPalestinian economy.\n\n00:11:03.958 --> 00:11:07.958\nThat, I believe, is going to bring peace to this particular conflict.\n\n00:11:07.958 --> 00:11:11.958\nThe lesson from Kurdistan and from Palestine\n\n00:11:11.958 --> 00:11:14.958\nis that independence alone, without infrastructure,\n\n00:11:14.958 --> 00:11:16.958\nis futile.\n\n00:11:16.958 --> 00:11:18.958\nNow what might this entire region look like\n\n00:11:18.958 --> 00:11:22.958\nif in fact we focus on other lines on the map besides borders,\n\n00:11:22.958 --> 00:11:25.958\nwhen the insecurities might abate?\n\n00:11:25.958 --> 00:11:27.958\nThe last time that was the case was actually\n\n00:11:27.958 --> 00:11:29.958\na century ago, during the Ottoman Empire.\n\n00:11:29.958 --> 00:11:31.958\nThis is the Hejaz Railway.\n\n00:11:31.958 --> 00:11:35.958\nThe Hejaz Railway ran from Istanbul to Medina via Damascus.\n\n00:11:35.958 --> 00:11:37.958\nIt even had an offshoot running to Haifa\n\n00:11:37.958 --> 00:11:39.958\nin what is today Israel, on the Mediterranean Sea.\n\n00:11:39.958 --> 00:11:43.958\nBut today the Hejaz Railway lies in tatters, ruins.\n\n00:11:43.958 --> 00:11:46.958\nIf we were to focus on reconstructing these curvy lines on the map,\n\n00:11:46.958 --> 00:11:49.958\ninfrastructure, that cross the straight lines, the borders,\n\n00:11:49.958 --> 00:11:53.958\nI believe the Middle East would be a far more peaceful region.\n\n00:11:53.958 --> 00:11:55.958\nNow let's look at another part of the world,\n\n00:11:55.958 --> 00:11:58.958\nthe former Soviet Republics of Central Asia, the 'stans.\n\n00:11:58.958 --> 00:12:01.958\nThese countries' borders originate from Stalin's decrees.\n\n00:12:01.958 --> 00:12:05.958\nHe purposely did not want these countries to make sense.\n\n00:12:05.958 --> 00:12:07.958\nHe wanted ethnicities to mingle\n\n00:12:07.958 --> 00:12:09.958\nin ways that would allow him to divide and rule.\n\n00:12:09.958 --> 00:12:12.958\nFortunately for them, most of their oil and gas resources\n\n00:12:12.958 --> 00:12:15.958\nwere discovered after the Soviet Union collapsed.\n\n00:12:15.958 --> 00:12:18.958\nNow I know some of you may be thinking, \"Oil, oil, oil.\n\n00:12:18.958 --> 00:12:20.958\nWhy is it all he's talking about is oil?\"\n\n00:12:20.958 --> 00:12:23.958\nWell, there is a big difference in the way we used to talk about oil\n\n00:12:23.958 --> 00:12:25.958\nand the way we're talking about it now.\n\n00:12:25.958 --> 00:12:28.958\nBefore it was, how do we control their oil?\n\n00:12:28.958 --> 00:12:30.958\nNow it's their oil for their own purposes.\n\n00:12:30.958 --> 00:12:32.958\nAnd I assure you it's every bit as important to them\n\n00:12:32.958 --> 00:12:36.958\nas it might have been to colonizers and imperialists.\n\n00:12:36.958 --> 00:12:38.958\nHere are just some of the pipeline projections\n\n00:12:38.958 --> 00:12:40.958\nand possibilities and scenarios\n\n00:12:40.958 --> 00:12:43.958\nand routes that are being mapped out for the next several decades.\n\n00:12:43.958 --> 00:12:45.958\nA great deal of them.\n\n00:12:45.958 --> 00:12:47.958\nFor a number of countries in this part of the world,\n\n00:12:47.958 --> 00:12:50.958\nhaving pipelines is the ticket to becoming part of the global economy\n\n00:12:50.958 --> 00:12:52.958\nand for having some meaning\n\n00:12:52.958 --> 00:12:54.958\nbesides the borders that they are not loyal to themselves.\n\n00:12:54.958 --> 00:12:57.958\nJust take Azerbaijan.\n\n00:12:57.958 --> 00:12:59.958\nAzerbaijan was a forgotten corner of the Caucuses,\n\n00:12:59.958 --> 00:13:03.958\nbut now with the Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan pipeline into Turkey,\n\n00:13:03.958 --> 00:13:07.958\nit has rebranded itself as the frontier of the west.\n\n00:13:07.958 --> 00:13:10.958\nThen there is Turkmenistan, which most people think of\n\n00:13:10.958 --> 00:13:12.958\nas a frozen basket case.\n\n00:13:12.958 --> 00:13:15.958\nBut now it's contributing gas across the Caspian Sea\n\n00:13:15.958 --> 00:13:17.958\nto provide for Europe,\n\n00:13:17.958 --> 00:13:19.958\nand even a potentially Turkmen-\n\n00:13:19.958 --> 00:13:23.958\nAfghan-Pakistan-India pipeline as well.\n\n00:13:23.958 --> 00:13:25.958\nThen there is Kazakhstan, which didn't even have a name before.\n\n00:13:25.958 --> 00:13:29.958\nIt was more considered South Siberia during the Soviet Union.\n\n00:13:29.958 --> 00:13:31.958\nToday most people recognize Kazakhstan\n\n00:13:31.958 --> 00:13:33.958\nas an emerging geopolitical player. Why?\n\n00:13:33.958 --> 00:13:37.958\nBecause it has shrewdly designed pipelines to flow across the Caspian,\n\n00:13:37.958 --> 00:13:41.958\nnorth through Russia, and even east to China.\n\n00:13:41.958 --> 00:13:45.958\nMore pipelines means more silk roads, instead of the Great Game.\n\n00:13:45.958 --> 00:13:49.958\nThe Great Game connotes dominance of one over the other.\n\n00:13:49.958 --> 00:13:52.958\nSilk road connotes independence and mutual trust.\n\n00:13:52.958 --> 00:13:55.958\nThe more pipelines we have, the more silk roads we'll have,\n\n00:13:55.958 --> 00:13:58.958\nand the less of a dominant Great Game competition\n\n00:13:58.958 --> 00:14:01.958\nwe'll have in the 21st century.\n\n00:14:01.958 --> 00:14:04.958\nNow let's look at the only part of the world that really has brought down its borders,\n\n00:14:04.958 --> 00:14:06.958\nand how that has enhanced its strength.\n\n00:14:06.958 --> 00:14:09.958\nAnd that is, of course, Europe.\n\n00:14:09.958 --> 00:14:12.958\nThe European Union began as just the coal and steel community of six countries,\n\n00:14:12.958 --> 00:14:16.958\nand their main purpose was really to keep the rehabilitation of Germany\n\n00:14:16.958 --> 00:14:18.958\nto happen in a peaceful way.\n\n00:14:18.958 --> 00:14:22.958\nBut then eventually it grew into 12 countries,\n\n00:14:22.958 --> 00:14:24.958\nand those are the 12 stars on the European flag.\n\n00:14:24.958 --> 00:14:26.958\nThe E.U. also became a currency block,\n\n00:14:26.958 --> 00:14:30.958\nand is now the most powerful trade block in the entire world.\n\n00:14:30.958 --> 00:14:33.958\nOn average, the E.U. has grown by one country per year\n\n00:14:33.958 --> 00:14:35.958\nsince the end of the Cold War.\n\n00:14:35.958 --> 00:14:38.958\nIn fact most of that happened on just one day.\n\n00:14:38.958 --> 00:14:40.958\nIn 2004, 15 new countries joined the E.U.\n\n00:14:40.958 --> 00:14:43.958\nand now you have what most people consider\n\n00:14:43.958 --> 00:14:45.958\na zone of peace spanning 27 countries\n\n00:14:45.958 --> 00:14:48.958\nand 450 million people.\n\n00:14:48.958 --> 00:14:52.958\nSo what is next? What is the future of the European Union?\n\n00:14:52.958 --> 00:14:54.958\nWell in light blue, you see the zones\n\n00:14:54.958 --> 00:14:56.958\nor the regions that are at least two-thirds\n\n00:14:56.958 --> 00:14:58.958\nor more dependent on the European Union\n\n00:14:58.958 --> 00:15:00.958\nfor trade and investment.\n\n00:15:00.958 --> 00:15:02.958\nWhat does that tell us? Trade and investment tell us\n\n00:15:02.958 --> 00:15:06.958\nthat Europe is putting its money where its mouth is.\n\n00:15:06.958 --> 00:15:08.958\nEven if these regions aren't part of the E.U.,\n\n00:15:08.958 --> 00:15:10.958\nthey are becoming part of its sphere of influence.\n\n00:15:10.958 --> 00:15:13.958\nJust take the Balkans. Croatia, Serbia\n\n00:15:13.958 --> 00:15:15.958\nBosnia, they're not members of the E.U. yet.\n\n00:15:15.958 --> 00:15:18.958\nBut you can get on a German ICE train\n\n00:15:18.958 --> 00:15:20.958\nand make it almost to Albania.\n\n00:15:20.958 --> 00:15:23.958\nIn Bosnia you use the Euro currency already,\n\n00:15:23.958 --> 00:15:26.958\nand that's the only currency they're probably ever going to have.\n\n00:15:26.958 --> 00:15:30.958\nSo, looking at other parts of Europe's periphery, such as North Africa.\n\n00:15:30.958 --> 00:15:32.958\nOn average, every year or two,\n\n00:15:32.958 --> 00:15:35.958\na new oil or gas pipeline opens up under the Mediterranean,\n\n00:15:35.958 --> 00:15:38.958\nconnecting North Africa to Europe.\n\n00:15:38.958 --> 00:15:40.958\nThat not only helps Europe diminish its reliance\n\n00:15:40.958 --> 00:15:42.958\non Russia for energy,\n\n00:15:42.958 --> 00:15:45.958\nbut if you travel to North Africa today, you'll hear more and more people saying\n\n00:15:45.958 --> 00:15:48.958\nthat they don't really think of their region as the Middle East.\n\n00:15:48.958 --> 00:15:51.958\nSo in other words, I believe that President Sarkozy of France\n\n00:15:51.958 --> 00:15:55.958\nis right when he talks about a Mediterranean union.\n\n00:15:55.958 --> 00:15:58.958\nNow let's look at Turkey and the Caucasus.\n\n00:15:58.958 --> 00:16:00.958\nI mentioned Azerbaijan before.\n\n00:16:00.958 --> 00:16:02.958\nThat corridor of Turkey and the Caucasus\n\n00:16:02.958 --> 00:16:04.958\nhas become the conduit for 20 percent\n\n00:16:04.958 --> 00:16:06.958\nof Europe's energy supply.\n\n00:16:06.958 --> 00:16:09.958\nSo does Turkey really have to be a member of the European Union?\n\n00:16:09.958 --> 00:16:11.958\nI don't think it does. I think it's already part of\n\n00:16:11.958 --> 00:16:14.958\na Euro-Turkish superpower.\n\n00:16:14.958 --> 00:16:17.958\nSo what's next? Where are we going to see borders change\n\n00:16:17.958 --> 00:16:19.958\nand new countries born?\n\n00:16:19.958 --> 00:16:21.958\nWell, South Central Asia, South West Asia\n\n00:16:21.958 --> 00:16:23.958\nis a very good place to start.\n\n00:16:23.958 --> 00:16:25.958\nEight years after the U.S. invaded Afghanistan\n\n00:16:25.958 --> 00:16:27.958\nthere is still a tremendous amount of instability.\n\n00:16:27.958 --> 00:16:30.958\nPakistan and Afghanistan are still so fragile\n\n00:16:30.958 --> 00:16:32.958\nthat neither of them have dealt constructively\n\n00:16:32.958 --> 00:16:35.958\nwith the problem of Pashtun nationalism.\n\n00:16:35.958 --> 00:16:37.958\nThis is the flag that flies in the minds\n\n00:16:37.958 --> 00:16:39.958\nof 20 million Pashtuns\n\n00:16:39.958 --> 00:16:42.958\nwho live on both sides of the Afghan and Pakistan border.\n\n00:16:42.958 --> 00:16:45.958\nLet's not neglect the insurgency just to the south,\n\n00:16:45.958 --> 00:16:47.958\nBalochistan. Two weeks ago,\n\n00:16:47.958 --> 00:16:50.958\nBalochi rebels attacked a Pakistani military garrison,\n\n00:16:50.958 --> 00:16:53.958\nand this was the flag that they raised over it.\n\n00:16:53.958 --> 00:16:55.958\nThe post-colonial entropy\n\n00:16:55.958 --> 00:16:57.958\nthat is happening around the world is accelerating,\n\n00:16:57.958 --> 00:17:00.958\nand I expect more such changes to occur in the map\n\n00:17:00.958 --> 00:17:02.958\nas the states fragment.\n\n00:17:02.958 --> 00:17:04.958\nOf course, we can't forget Africa.\n\n00:17:04.958 --> 00:17:06.958\n53 countries, and by far the most number\n\n00:17:06.958 --> 00:17:09.958\nof suspiciously straight lines on the map.\n\n00:17:09.958 --> 00:17:11.958\nIf we were to look at all of Africa\n\n00:17:11.958 --> 00:17:14.958\nwe could most certainly acknowledge far more,\n\n00:17:14.958 --> 00:17:16.958\ntribal divisions and so forth.\n\n00:17:16.958 --> 00:17:20.958\nBut let's just look at Sudan, the second-largest country in Africa.\n\n00:17:20.958 --> 00:17:22.958\nIt has three ongoing civil wars,\n\n00:17:22.958 --> 00:17:25.958\nthe genocide in Darfur, which you all know about,\n\n00:17:25.958 --> 00:17:27.958\nthe civil war in the east of the country,\n\n00:17:27.958 --> 00:17:29.958\nand south Sudan.\n\n00:17:29.958 --> 00:17:32.958\nSouth Sudan is going to be having a referendum in 2011\n\n00:17:32.958 --> 00:17:35.958\nin which it is very likely to vote itself independence.\n\n00:17:35.958 --> 00:17:39.958\nNow let's go up to the Arctic Circle.\n\n00:17:39.958 --> 00:17:41.958\nThere is a great race on for energy resources\n\n00:17:41.958 --> 00:17:43.958\nunder the Arctic seabed.\n\n00:17:43.958 --> 00:17:45.958\nWho will win? Canada? Russia? The United States?\n\n00:17:45.958 --> 00:17:47.958\nActually Greenland.\n\n00:17:47.958 --> 00:17:50.958\nSeveral weeks ago Greenland's [60,000] people\n\n00:17:50.958 --> 00:17:52.958\nvoted themselves self-governance rights\n\n00:17:52.958 --> 00:17:54.958\nfrom Denmark.\n\n00:17:54.958 --> 00:17:57.958\nSo Denmark is about to get a whole lot smaller.\n\n00:17:57.958 --> 00:17:59.958\nWhat is the lesson from all of this?\n\n00:17:59.958 --> 00:18:03.958\nGeopolitics is a very unsentimental discipline.\n\n00:18:03.958 --> 00:18:05.958\nIt's constantly morphing and changing the world,\n\n00:18:05.958 --> 00:18:07.958\nlike climate change.\n\n00:18:07.958 --> 00:18:09.958\nAnd like our relationship with the ecosystem\n\n00:18:09.958 --> 00:18:11.958\nwe're always searching for equilibrium\n\n00:18:11.958 --> 00:18:14.958\nin how we divide ourselves across the planet.\n\n00:18:14.958 --> 00:18:16.958\nNow we fear changes on the map.\n\n00:18:16.958 --> 00:18:18.958\nWe fear civil wars, death tolls,\n\n00:18:18.958 --> 00:18:21.958\nhaving to learn the names of new countries.\n\n00:18:21.958 --> 00:18:24.958\nBut I believe that the inertia of the existing borders that we have today\n\n00:18:24.958 --> 00:18:26.958\nis far worse and far more violent.\n\n00:18:26.958 --> 00:18:28.958\nThe question is how do we change those borders,\n\n00:18:28.958 --> 00:18:30.958\nand what lines do we focus on?\n\n00:18:30.958 --> 00:18:32.958\nI believe we focus on the lines that cross borders,\n\n00:18:32.958 --> 00:18:34.958\nthe infrastructure lines.\n\n00:18:34.958 --> 00:18:37.958\nThen we'll wind up with the world we want, a borderless one.\n\n00:18:37.958 --> 00:18:39.958\nThank you.\n\n00:18:39.958 --> 00:18:44.958\n(Applause)"}, {"title": "Designers -- think big!", "duration": "1010", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/tim_brown_urges_designers_to_think_big", "transcript": "I'd like to talk a little bit this morning about what happens if we move from design to design thinking. Now this rather old photo up there is actually the first project I was ever hired to do, something like 25 years ago. It's a woodworking machine, or at least a piece of one, and my task was to make this thing a little bit more modern, a little bit easier to use. I thought, at the time, I did a pretty good job. Unfortunately, not very long afterwards the company went out of business.This is the second project that I did. It's a fax machine. I put an attractive shell around some new technology. Again, 18 months later, the product was obsolete. And now, of course, the whole technology is obsolete. Now, I'm a fairly slow learner, but eventually it occurred to me that maybe what passed for design wasn't all that important \u2014 making things more attractive, making them a bit easier to use, making them more marketable. By focusing on a design, maybe just a single product, I was being incremental and not having much of an impact.But I think this small view of design is a relatively recent phenomenon, and in fact really emerged in the latter half of the 20th century as design became a tool of consumerism. So when we talk about design today, and particularly when we read about it in the popular press, we're often talking about products like these. Amusing? Yes. Desirable? Maybe. Important? Not so very.But this wasn't always the way. And I'd like to suggest that if we take a different view of design, and focus less on the object and more on design thinking as an approach, that we actually might see the result in a bigger impact. Now this gentleman, Isambard Kingdom Brunel, designed many great things in his career in the 19th century, including the Clifton suspension bridge in Bristol and the Thames tunnel at Rotherhithe. Both great designs and actually very innovative too. His greatest creation runs actually right through here in Oxford. It's called the Great Western Railway.And as a kid I grew up very close to here, and one of my favorite things to do was to cycle along by the side of the railway waiting for the great big express trains to roar past. You can see it represented here in J.M.W. Turner's painting, \"Rain, Steam and Speed\". Now, what Brunel said that he wanted to achieve for his passengers was the experience of floating across the countryside.Now, this was back in the 19th century. And to do that meant creating the flattest gradients that had ever yet been made, which meant building long viaducts across river valleys \u2014 this is actually the viaduct across the Thames at Maidenhead \u2014 and long tunnels such as the one at Box, in Wiltshire. But he didn't stop there. He didn't stop with just trying to design the best railway journey. He imagined an integrated transportation system in which it would be possible for a passenger to embark on a train in London and disembark from a ship in New York. One journey from London to New York. This is the S.S. Great Western that he built to take care of the second half of that journey.Now, Brunel was working 100 years before the emergence of the design profession, but I think he was using design thinking to solve problems and to create world-changing innovations. Now, design thinking begins with what Roger Martin, the business school professor at the University of Toronto, calls integrative thinking. And that's the ability to exploit opposing ideas and opposing constraints to create new solutions. In the case of design, that means balancing desirability, what humans need, with technical feasibility, and economic viability. With innovations like the Great Western, we can stretch that balance to the absolute limit.So somehow, we went from this to this. Systems thinkers who were reinventing the world, to a priesthood of folks in black turtlenecks and designer glasses working on small things. As our industrial society matured, so design became a profession and it focused on an ever smaller canvas until it came to stand for aesthetics, image and fashion. Now I'm not trying to throw stones here. I'm a fully paid-up member of that priesthood, and somewhere in here I have my designer glasses. There we go. But I do think that perhaps design is getting big again. And that's happening through the application of design thinking to new kinds of problems \u2014 to global warming, to education, healthcare, security, clean water, whatever.And as we see this reemergence of design thinking and we see it beginning to tackle new kinds of problems, there are some basic ideas that I think we can observe that are useful. And I'd like to talk about some of those just for the next few minutes. The first of those is that design is human-centered. It may integrate technology and economics, but it starts with what humans need, or might need. What makes life easier, more enjoyable? What makes technology useful and usable? But that is more than simply good ergonomics, putting the buttons in the right place. It's often about understanding culture and context before we even know where to start to have ideas.So when a team was working on a new vision screening program in India, they wanted to understand what the aspirations and motivations were of these school children to understand how they might play a role in screening their parents. Conversion Sound has developed a high quality, ultra-low-cost digital hearing aid for the developing world. Now, in the West we rely on highly trained technicians to fit these hearing aids. In places like India, those technicians simply don't exist. So it took a team working in India with patients and community health workers to understand how a PDA and an application on a PDA might replace those technicians in a fitting and diagnostic service.Instead of starting with technology, the team started with people and culture. So if human need is the place to start, then design thinking rapidly moves on to learning by making. Instead of thinking about what to build, building in order to think. Now, prototypes speed up the process of innovation, because it is only when we put our ideas out into the world that we really start to understand their strengths and weaknesses. And the faster we do that, the faster our ideas evolve.Now, much has been said and written about the Aravind Eye Institute in Madurai, India. They do an incredible job of serving very poor patients by taking the revenues from those who can afford to pay to cross-subsidize those who cannot. Now, they are very efficient, but they are also very innovative. When I visited them a few years ago, what really impressed me was their willingness to prototype their ideas very early.This is the manufacturing facility for one of their biggest cost breakthroughs. They make their own intraocular lenses. These are the lenses that replace those that are damaged by cataracts. And I think it's partly their prototyping mentality that really allowed them to achieve the breakthrough. Because they brought the cost down from $200 a pair, down to just $4 a pair. Partly they did this by instead of building a fancy new factory, they used the basement of one of their hospitals. And instead of installing the large-scale machines used by western producers, they used low-cost CAD/CAM prototyping technology. They are now the biggest manufacturer of these lenses in the developing world and have recently moved into a custom factory.So if human need is the place to start, and prototyping, a vehicle for progress, then there are also some questions to ask about the destination. Instead of seeing its primary objective as consumption, design thinking is beginning to explore the potential of participation \u2014 the shift from a passive relationship between consumer and producer to the active engagement of everyone in experiences that are meaningful, productive and profitable.So I'd like to take the idea that Rory Sutherland talked about, this notion that intangible things are worth perhaps more than physical things, and take that a little bit further and say that I think the design of participatory systems, in which many more forms of value beyond simply cash are both created and measured, is going to be the major theme, not only for design, but also for our economy as we go forward.So William Beveridge, when he wrote the first of his famous reports in 1942, created what became Britain's welfare state in which he hoped that every citizen would be an active participant in their own social well-being. By the time he wrote his third report, he confessed that he had failed and instead had created a society of welfare consumers.Hilary Cottam, Charlie Leadbeater, and Hugo Manassei of Participle have taken this idea of participation, and in their manifesto entitled Beveridge 4.0, they are suggesting a framework for reinventing the welfare state. So in one of their projects called Southwark Circle, they worked with residents in Southwark, South London and a small team of designers to develop a new membership organization to help the elderly with household tasks. Designs were refined and developed with 150 older people and their families before the service was launched earlier this year.We can take this idea of participation perhaps to its logical conclusion and say that design may have its greatest impact when it's taken out of the hands of designers and put into the hands of everyone. Nurses and practitioners at U.S. healthcare system Kaiser Permanente study the topic of improving the patient experience, and particularly focused on the way that they exchange knowledge and change shift. Through a program of observational research, brainstorming new solutions and rapid prototyping, they've developed a completely new way to change shift.They went from retreating to the nurse's station to discuss the various states and needs of patients, to developing a system that happened on the ward in front of patients, using a simple software tool. By doing this they brought the time that they were away from patients down from 40 minutes to 12 minutes, on average. They increased patient confidence and nurse happiness. When you multiply that by all the nurses in all the wards in 40 hospitals in the system, it resulted, actually, in a pretty big impact.And this is just one of thousands of opportunities in healthcare alone. So these are just some of the kind of basic ideas around design thinking and some of the new kinds of projects that they're being applied to. But I'd like to go back to Brunel here, and suggest a connection that might explain why this is happening now, and maybe why design thinking is a useful tool. And that connection is change. In times of change we need new alternatives, new ideas.Now, Brunel worked at the height of the Industrial Revolution, when all of life and our economy was being reinvented. Now the industrial systems of Brunel's time have run their course, and indeed they are part of the problem today. But, again, we are in the midst of massive change. And that change is forcing us to question quite fundamental aspects of our society \u2014 how we keep ourselves healthy, how we govern ourselves, how we educate ourselves, how we keep ourselves secure. And in these times of change, we need these new choices because our existing solutions are simply becoming obsolete.So why design thinking? Because it gives us a new way of tackling problems. Instead of defaulting to our normal convergent approach where we make the best choice out of available alternatives, it encourages us to take a divergent approach, to explore new alternatives, new solutions, new ideas that have not existed before. But before we go through that process of divergence, there is actually quite an important first step. And that is, what is the question that we're trying to answer? What's the design brief? Now Brunel may have asked a question like this, \"How do I take a train from London to New York?\" But what are the kinds of questions that we might ask today?So these are some that we've been asked to think about recently. And one in particular, is one that we're working on with the Acumen Fund, in a project that's been funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. How might we improve access to safe drinking water for the world's poorest people, and at the same time stimulate innovation amongst local water providers?So instead of having a bunch of American designers come up with new ideas that may or may not have been appropriate, we took a sort of more open, collaborative and participative approach. We teamed designers and investment experts up with 11 water organizations across India. And through workshops they developed innovative new products, services, and business models.We hosted a competition and then funded five of those organizations to develop their ideas. So they developed and iterated these ideas. And then IDEO and Acumen spent several weeks working with them to help design new social marketing campaigns, community outreach strategies, business models, new water vessels for storing water and carts for delivering water. Some of those ideas are just getting launched into the market. And the same process is just getting underway with NGOs in East Africa.So for me, this project shows kind of how far we can go from some of those sort of small things that I was working on at the beginning of my career. That by focusing on the needs of humans and by using prototypes to move ideas along quickly, by getting the process out of the hands of designers, and by getting the active participation of the community, we can tackle bigger and more interesting questions. And just like Brunel, by focusing on systems, we can have a bigger impact. So that's one thing that we've been working on.I'm actually really quite interested, and perhaps more interested to know what this community thinks we could work on. What kinds of questions do we think design thinking could be used to tackle? And if you've got any ideas then feel free, you can post them to Twitter. There is a hash tag there that you can use, #CBDQ. And the list looked something like this a little while ago. And of course you can search to find the questions that you're interested in by using the same hash code.So I'd like to believe that design thinking actually can make a difference, that it can help create new ideas and new innovations, beyond the latest High Street products. To do that I think we have to take a more expansive view of design, more like Brunel, less a domain of a professional priesthood. And the first step is to start asking the right questions. Thank you very much.

It's a fax machine.\n\n00:00:45.958 --> 00:00:48.958\nI put an attractive shell around some new technology.\n\n00:00:48.958 --> 00:00:50.958\nAgain, 18 months later,\n\n00:00:50.958 --> 00:00:52.958\nthe product was obsolete.\n\n00:00:52.958 --> 00:00:57.958\nAnd now, of course, the whole technology is obsolete.\n\n00:00:57.958 --> 00:00:59.958\nNow, I'm a fairly slow learner,\n\n00:00:59.958 --> 00:01:01.958\nbut eventually it occurred to me that\n\n00:01:01.958 --> 00:01:03.958\nmaybe what passed for design\n\n00:01:03.958 --> 00:01:05.958\nwasn't all that important --\n\n00:01:05.958 --> 00:01:07.958\nmaking things more attractive,\n\n00:01:07.958 --> 00:01:09.958\nmaking them a bit easier to use,\n\n00:01:09.958 --> 00:01:12.958\nmaking them more marketable.\n\n00:01:12.958 --> 00:01:14.958\nBy focusing on a design,\n\n00:01:14.958 --> 00:01:16.958\nmaybe just a single product,\n\n00:01:16.958 --> 00:01:18.958\nI was being incremental\n\n00:01:18.958 --> 00:01:22.958\nand not having much of an impact.\n\n00:01:22.958 --> 00:01:24.958\nBut I think this small view of design\n\n00:01:24.958 --> 00:01:26.958\nis a relatively recent phenomenon,\n\n00:01:26.958 --> 00:01:28.958\nand in fact really emerged\n\n00:01:28.958 --> 00:01:30.958\nin the latter half of the 20th century\n\n00:01:30.958 --> 00:01:34.958\nas design became a tool of consumerism.\n\n00:01:34.958 --> 00:01:36.958\nSo when we talk about design today,\n\n00:01:36.958 --> 00:01:39.958\nand particularly when we read about it in the popular press,\n\n00:01:39.958 --> 00:01:41.958\nwe're often talking about products like these.\n\n00:01:41.958 --> 00:01:44.958\nAmusing? Yes. Desirable? Maybe.\n\n00:01:44.958 --> 00:01:47.958\nImportant? Not so very.\n\n00:01:47.958 --> 00:01:49.958\nBut this wasn't always the way.\n\n00:01:49.958 --> 00:01:51.958\nAnd I'd like to suggest that if we take\n\n00:01:51.958 --> 00:01:53.958\na different view of design,\n\n00:01:53.958 --> 00:01:56.958\nand focus less on the object\n\n00:01:56.958 --> 00:01:59.958\nand more on design thinking as an approach,\n\n00:01:59.958 --> 00:02:04.958\nthat we actually might see the result in a bigger impact.\n\n00:02:04.958 --> 00:02:06.958\nNow this gentleman, Isambard Kingdom Brunel,\n\n00:02:06.958 --> 00:02:10.958\ndesigned many great things in his career in the 19th century,\n\n00:02:10.958 --> 00:02:14.958\nincluding the Clifton suspension bridge in Bristol\n\n00:02:14.958 --> 00:02:16.958\nand the Thames tunnel at Rotherhithe.\n\n00:02:16.958 --> 00:02:21.958\nBoth great designs and actually very innovative too.\n\n00:02:21.958 --> 00:02:24.958\nHis greatest creation\n\n00:02:24.958 --> 00:02:26.958\nruns actually right through here in Oxford.\n\n00:02:26.958 --> 00:02:29.958\nIt's called the Great Western Railway.\n\n00:02:29.958 --> 00:02:32.958\nAnd as a kid I grew up very close to here,\n\n00:02:32.958 --> 00:02:34.958\nand one of my favorite things to do\n\n00:02:34.958 --> 00:02:37.958\nwas to cycle along by the side of the railway\n\n00:02:37.958 --> 00:02:40.958\nwaiting for the great big express trains to roar past.\n\n00:02:40.958 --> 00:02:42.958\nYou can see it represented here in J.M.W. Turner's painting,\n\n00:02:42.958 --> 00:02:45.958\n\"Rain, Steam and Speed\".\n\n00:02:45.958 --> 00:02:49.958\nNow, what Brunel said that he wanted to achieve for his passengers\n\n00:02:49.958 --> 00:02:54.958\nwas the experience of floating across the countryside.\n\n00:02:54.958 --> 00:02:56.958\nNow, this was back in the 19th century.\n\n00:02:56.958 --> 00:02:58.958\nAnd to do that meant creating the flattest gradients\n\n00:02:58.958 --> 00:03:00.958\nthat had ever yet been made,\n\n00:03:00.958 --> 00:03:03.958\nwhich meant building long viaducts across river valleys --\n\n00:03:03.958 --> 00:03:07.958\nthis is actually the viaduct across the Thames at Maidenhead --\n\n00:03:07.958 --> 00:03:13.958\nand long tunnels such as the one at Box, in Wiltshire.\n\n00:03:13.958 --> 00:03:15.958\nBut he didn't stop there. He didn't stop\n\n00:03:15.958 --> 00:03:18.958\nwith just trying to design the best railway journey.\n\n00:03:18.958 --> 00:03:22.958\nHe imagined an integrated transportation system\n\n00:03:22.958 --> 00:03:25.958\nin which it would be possible for a passenger to embark\n\n00:03:25.958 --> 00:03:28.958\non a train in London\n\n00:03:28.958 --> 00:03:31.958\nand disembark from a ship in New York.\n\n00:03:31.958 --> 00:03:35.958\nOne journey from London to New York.\n\n00:03:35.958 --> 00:03:37.958\nThis is the S.S. Great Western that he built\n\n00:03:37.958 --> 00:03:41.958\nto take care of the second half of that journey.\n\n00:03:41.958 --> 00:03:43.958\nNow, Brunel was working 100 years before\n\n00:03:43.958 --> 00:03:46.958\nthe emergence of the design profession,\n\n00:03:46.958 --> 00:03:49.958\nbut I think he was using design thinking\n\n00:03:49.958 --> 00:03:54.958\nto solve problems and to create world-changing innovations.\n\n00:03:54.958 --> 00:03:56.958\nNow, design thinking begins with what Roger Martin,\n\n00:03:56.958 --> 00:03:59.958\nthe business school professor at the University of Toronto,\n\n00:03:59.958 --> 00:04:01.958\ncalls integrative thinking.\n\n00:04:01.958 --> 00:04:04.958\nAnd that's the ability to exploit opposing ideas\n\n00:04:04.958 --> 00:04:06.958\nand opposing constraints\n\n00:04:06.958 --> 00:04:08.958\nto create new solutions.\n\n00:04:08.958 --> 00:04:11.958\nIn the case of design, that means\n\n00:04:11.958 --> 00:04:15.958\nbalancing desirability, what humans need,\n\n00:04:15.958 --> 00:04:17.958\nwith technical feasibility,\n\n00:04:17.958 --> 00:04:20.958\nand economic viability.\n\n00:04:20.958 --> 00:04:22.958\nWith innovations like the Great Western,\n\n00:04:22.958 --> 00:04:26.958\nwe can stretch that balance to the absolute limit.\n\n00:04:26.958 --> 00:04:33.958\nSo somehow, we went from this to this.\n\n00:04:33.958 --> 00:04:36.958\nSystems thinkers who were reinventing the world,\n\n00:04:36.958 --> 00:04:41.958\nto a priesthood of folks in black turtlenecks and designer glasses\n\n00:04:41.958 --> 00:04:43.958\nworking on small things.\n\n00:04:43.958 --> 00:04:47.958\nAs our industrial society matured,\n\n00:04:47.958 --> 00:04:49.958\nso design became a profession\n\n00:04:49.958 --> 00:04:52.958\nand it focused on an ever smaller canvas\n\n00:04:52.958 --> 00:04:54.958\nuntil it came to stand for aesthetics,\n\n00:04:54.958 --> 00:04:56.958\nimage and fashion.\n\n00:04:56.958 --> 00:04:59.958\nNow I'm not trying to throw stones here.\n\n00:04:59.958 --> 00:05:01.958\nI'm a fully paid-up member of that priesthood,\n\n00:05:01.958 --> 00:05:03.958\nand somewhere in here I have my designer glasses.\n\n00:05:03.958 --> 00:05:06.958\nThere we go.\n\n00:05:06.958 --> 00:05:08.958\nBut I do think that perhaps design\n\n00:05:08.958 --> 00:05:10.958\nis getting big again.\n\n00:05:10.958 --> 00:05:13.958\nAnd that's happening through\n\n00:05:13.958 --> 00:05:15.958\nthe application of design thinking\n\n00:05:15.958 --> 00:05:17.958\nto new kinds of problems --\n\n00:05:17.958 --> 00:05:19.958\nto global warming, to education,\n\n00:05:19.958 --> 00:05:23.958\nhealthcare, security, clean water, whatever.\n\n00:05:23.958 --> 00:05:26.958\nAnd as we see this reemergence of design thinking\n\n00:05:26.958 --> 00:05:29.958\nand we see it beginning to tackle new kinds of problems,\n\n00:05:29.958 --> 00:05:32.958\nthere are some basic ideas that I think we can observe that are useful.\n\n00:05:32.958 --> 00:05:34.958\nAnd I'd like to talk about some of those\n\n00:05:34.958 --> 00:05:36.958\njust for the next few minutes.\n\n00:05:36.958 --> 00:05:38.958\nThe first of those is that design is\n\n00:05:38.958 --> 00:05:41.958\nhuman-centered.\n\n00:05:41.958 --> 00:05:43.958\nIt may integrate technology and economics,\n\n00:05:43.958 --> 00:05:47.958\nbut it starts with what humans need, or might need.\n\n00:05:47.958 --> 00:05:49.958\nWhat makes life easier, more enjoyable?\n\n00:05:49.958 --> 00:05:53.958\nWhat makes technology useful and usable?\n\n00:05:53.958 --> 00:05:56.958\nBut that is more than simply good ergonomics,\n\n00:05:56.958 --> 00:05:59.958\nputting the buttons in the right place.\n\n00:05:59.958 --> 00:06:02.958\nIt's often about understanding culture and context\n\n00:06:02.958 --> 00:06:05.958\nbefore we even know where to start to have ideas.\n\n00:06:05.958 --> 00:06:09.958\nSo when a team was working on a new vision screening program in India,\n\n00:06:09.958 --> 00:06:11.958\nthey wanted to understand what the aspirations\n\n00:06:11.958 --> 00:06:14.958\nand motivations were of these school children\n\n00:06:14.958 --> 00:06:16.958\nto understand how they might play a role\n\n00:06:16.958 --> 00:06:21.958\nin screening their parents.\n\n00:06:21.958 --> 00:06:23.958\nConversion Sound has developed a high quality,\n\n00:06:23.958 --> 00:06:26.958\nultra-low-cost digital hearing aid\n\n00:06:26.958 --> 00:06:28.958\nfor the developing world.\n\n00:06:28.958 --> 00:06:32.958\nNow, in the West we rely on highly trained technicians\n\n00:06:32.958 --> 00:06:34.958\nto fit these hearing aids.\n\n00:06:34.958 --> 00:06:38.958\nIn places like India, those technicians simply don't exist.\n\n00:06:38.958 --> 00:06:40.958\nSo it took a team working in India\n\n00:06:40.958 --> 00:06:42.958\nwith patients and community health workers\n\n00:06:42.958 --> 00:06:44.958\nto understand how a PDA\n\n00:06:44.958 --> 00:06:46.958\nand an application on a PDA\n\n00:06:46.958 --> 00:06:48.958\nmight replace those technicians\n\n00:06:48.958 --> 00:06:51.958\nin a fitting and diagnostic service.\n\n00:06:51.958 --> 00:06:53.958\nInstead of starting with technology,\n\n00:06:53.958 --> 00:06:56.958\nthe team started with people and culture.\n\n00:06:56.958 --> 00:06:59.958\nSo if human need is the place to start,\n\n00:06:59.958 --> 00:07:01.958\nthen design thinking rapidly moves on to\n\n00:07:01.958 --> 00:07:03.958\nlearning by making.\n\n00:07:03.958 --> 00:07:06.958\nInstead of thinking about what to build,\n\n00:07:06.958 --> 00:07:09.958\nbuilding in order to think.\n\n00:07:09.958 --> 00:07:12.958\nNow, prototypes speed up the process of innovation,\n\n00:07:12.958 --> 00:07:15.958\nbecause it is only when we put our ideas out into the world\n\n00:07:15.958 --> 00:07:18.958\nthat we really start to understand their strengths and weaknesses.\n\n00:07:18.958 --> 00:07:20.958\nAnd the faster we do that,\n\n00:07:20.958 --> 00:07:23.958\nthe faster our ideas evolve.\n\n00:07:23.958 --> 00:07:25.958\nNow, much has been said and written about\n\n00:07:25.958 --> 00:07:28.958\nthe Aravind Eye Institute in Madurai, India.\n\n00:07:28.958 --> 00:07:32.958\nThey do an incredible job of serving very poor patients\n\n00:07:32.958 --> 00:07:34.958\nby taking the revenues from those who can afford to pay\n\n00:07:34.958 --> 00:07:38.958\nto cross-subsidize those who cannot.\n\n00:07:38.958 --> 00:07:41.958\nNow, they are very efficient,\n\n00:07:41.958 --> 00:07:44.958\nbut they are also very innovative.\n\n00:07:44.958 --> 00:07:47.958\nWhen I visited them a few years ago,\n\n00:07:47.958 --> 00:07:49.958\nwhat really impressed me was their willingness\n\n00:07:49.958 --> 00:07:51.958\nto prototype their ideas very early.\n\n00:07:51.958 --> 00:07:53.958\nThis is the manufacturing facility\n\n00:07:53.958 --> 00:07:55.958\nfor one of their biggest cost breakthroughs.\n\n00:07:55.958 --> 00:07:58.958\nThey make their own intraocular lenses.\n\n00:07:58.958 --> 00:08:00.958\nThese are the lenses that replace those\n\n00:08:00.958 --> 00:08:02.958\nthat are damaged by cataracts.\n\n00:08:02.958 --> 00:08:06.958\nAnd I think it's partly their prototyping mentality\n\n00:08:06.958 --> 00:08:08.958\nthat really allowed them to achieve the breakthrough.\n\n00:08:08.958 --> 00:08:10.958\nBecause they brought the cost down\n\n00:08:10.958 --> 00:08:11.958\nfrom $200 a pair,\n\n00:08:11.958 --> 00:08:16.958\ndown to just $4 a pair.\n\n00:08:16.958 --> 00:08:18.958\nPartly they did this by instead of building\n\n00:08:18.958 --> 00:08:20.958\na fancy new factory,\n\n00:08:20.958 --> 00:08:24.958\nthey used the basement of one of their hospitals.\n\n00:08:24.958 --> 00:08:27.958\nAnd instead of installing the large-scale machines\n\n00:08:27.958 --> 00:08:29.958\nused by western producers,\n\n00:08:29.958 --> 00:08:33.958\nthey used low-cost CAD/CAM prototyping technology.\n\n00:08:33.958 --> 00:08:37.958\nThey are now the biggest manufacturer of these lenses in the developing world\n\n00:08:37.958 --> 00:08:41.958\nand have recently moved into a custom factory.\n\n00:08:41.958 --> 00:08:43.958\nSo if human need is the place to start,\n\n00:08:43.958 --> 00:08:45.958\nand prototyping, a vehicle for progress,\n\n00:08:45.958 --> 00:08:49.958\nthen there are also some questions to ask about the destination.\n\n00:08:49.958 --> 00:08:54.958\nInstead of seeing its primary objective as consumption,\n\n00:08:54.958 --> 00:08:57.958\ndesign thinking is beginning to explore the potential of participation --\n\n00:08:57.958 --> 00:09:00.958\nthe shift from a passive relationship\n\n00:09:00.958 --> 00:09:02.958\nbetween consumer and producer\n\n00:09:02.958 --> 00:09:04.958\nto the active engagement of everyone\n\n00:09:04.958 --> 00:09:06.958\nin experiences that are meaningful,\n\n00:09:06.958 --> 00:09:10.958\nproductive and profitable.\n\n00:09:10.958 --> 00:09:13.958\nSo I'd like to take the idea that Rory Sutherland talked about,\n\n00:09:13.958 --> 00:09:16.958\nthis notion that intangible things are worth perhaps more than physical things,\n\n00:09:16.958 --> 00:09:18.958\nand take that a little bit further and say that\n\n00:09:18.958 --> 00:09:21.958\nI think the design of participatory systems,\n\n00:09:21.958 --> 00:09:24.958\nin which many more forms of value\n\n00:09:24.958 --> 00:09:26.958\nbeyond simply cash\n\n00:09:26.958 --> 00:09:29.958\nare both created and measured,\n\n00:09:29.958 --> 00:09:32.958\nis going to be the major theme, not only for design,\n\n00:09:32.958 --> 00:09:36.958\nbut also for our economy as we go forward.\n\n00:09:36.958 --> 00:09:40.958\nSo William Beveridge, when he wrote the first of his famous reports in 1942,\n\n00:09:40.958 --> 00:09:44.958\ncreated what became Britain's welfare state\n\n00:09:44.958 --> 00:09:47.958\nin which he hoped that every citizen\n\n00:09:47.958 --> 00:09:49.958\nwould be an active participant\n\n00:09:49.958 --> 00:09:51.958\nin their own social well-being.\n\n00:09:51.958 --> 00:09:54.958\nBy the time he wrote his third report,\n\n00:09:54.958 --> 00:09:56.958\nhe confessed that he had failed\n\n00:09:56.958 --> 00:10:02.958\nand instead had created a society of welfare consumers.\n\n00:10:02.958 --> 00:10:04.958\nHilary Cottam, Charlie Leadbeater,\n\n00:10:04.958 --> 00:10:06.958\nand Hugo Manassei of Participle\n\n00:10:06.958 --> 00:10:09.958\nhave taken this idea of participation,\n\n00:10:09.958 --> 00:10:12.958\nand in their manifesto entitled Beveridge 4.0,\n\n00:10:12.958 --> 00:10:14.958\nthey are suggesting a framework\n\n00:10:14.958 --> 00:10:17.958\nfor reinventing the welfare state.\n\n00:10:17.958 --> 00:10:19.958\nSo in one of their projects called Southwark Circle,\n\n00:10:19.958 --> 00:10:22.958\nthey worked with residents in Southwark, South London\n\n00:10:22.958 --> 00:10:24.958\nand a small team of designers\n\n00:10:24.958 --> 00:10:28.958\nto develop a new membership organization\n\n00:10:28.958 --> 00:10:31.958\nto help the elderly with household tasks.\n\n00:10:31.958 --> 00:10:33.958\nDesigns were refined and developed\n\n00:10:33.958 --> 00:10:36.958\nwith 150 older people and their families\n\n00:10:36.958 --> 00:10:41.958\nbefore the service was launched earlier this year.\n\n00:10:41.958 --> 00:10:45.958\nWe can take this idea of participation\n\n00:10:45.958 --> 00:10:47.958\nperhaps to its logical conclusion\n\n00:10:47.958 --> 00:10:49.958\nand say that design may have its greatest impact\n\n00:10:49.958 --> 00:10:52.958\nwhen it's taken out of the hands of designers\n\n00:10:52.958 --> 00:10:55.958\nand put into the hands of everyone.\n\n00:10:55.958 --> 00:10:58.958\nNurses and practitioners at U.S. healthcare system\n\n00:10:58.958 --> 00:11:00.958\nKaiser Permanente\n\n00:11:00.958 --> 00:11:05.958\nstudy the topic of improving the patient experience,\n\n00:11:05.958 --> 00:11:10.958\nand particularly focused on the way that they exchange knowledge\n\n00:11:10.958 --> 00:11:13.958\nand change shift.\n\n00:11:13.958 --> 00:11:15.958\nThrough a program of observational research,\n\n00:11:15.958 --> 00:11:18.958\nbrainstorming new solutions and rapid prototyping,\n\n00:11:18.958 --> 00:11:21.958\nthey've developed a completely new way to change shift.\n\n00:11:21.958 --> 00:11:25.958\nThey went from retreating to the nurse's station\n\n00:11:25.958 --> 00:11:27.958\nto discuss the various states and needs of patients,\n\n00:11:27.958 --> 00:11:30.958\nto developing a system that happened on the ward\n\n00:11:30.958 --> 00:11:33.958\nin front of patients, using a simple software tool.\n\n00:11:33.958 --> 00:11:35.958\nBy doing this they brought the time that they were away from patients\n\n00:11:35.958 --> 00:11:39.958\ndown from 40 minutes to 12 minutes, on average.\n\n00:11:39.958 --> 00:11:43.958\nThey increased patient confidence and nurse happiness.\n\n00:11:43.958 --> 00:11:45.958\nWhen you multiply that by all the nurses\n\n00:11:45.958 --> 00:11:48.958\nin all the wards in 40 hospitals in the system,\n\n00:11:48.958 --> 00:11:50.958\nit resulted, actually, in a pretty big impact.\n\n00:11:50.958 --> 00:11:52.958\nAnd this is just one of thousands\n\n00:11:52.958 --> 00:11:58.958\nof opportunities in healthcare alone.\n\n00:11:58.958 --> 00:12:01.958\nSo these are just some of the kind of basic ideas\n\n00:12:01.958 --> 00:12:03.958\naround design thinking\n\n00:12:03.958 --> 00:12:05.958\nand some of the new kinds of projects\n\n00:12:05.958 --> 00:12:08.958\nthat they're being applied to.\n\n00:12:08.958 --> 00:12:10.958\nBut I'd like to go back to Brunel here,\n\n00:12:10.958 --> 00:12:14.958\nand suggest a connection that might explain why this is happening now,\n\n00:12:14.958 --> 00:12:19.958\nand maybe why design thinking is a useful tool.\n\n00:12:19.958 --> 00:12:22.958\nAnd that connection is change.\n\n00:12:22.958 --> 00:12:24.958\nIn times of change we need\n\n00:12:24.958 --> 00:12:28.958\nnew alternatives, new ideas.\n\n00:12:28.958 --> 00:12:30.958\nNow, Brunel worked at the height of the Industrial Revolution,\n\n00:12:30.958 --> 00:12:32.958\nwhen all of life and our economy\n\n00:12:32.958 --> 00:12:34.958\nwas being reinvented.\n\n00:12:34.958 --> 00:12:38.958\nNow the industrial systems of Brunel's time have run their course,\n\n00:12:38.958 --> 00:12:40.958\nand indeed they are part of the problem today.\n\n00:12:40.958 --> 00:12:44.958\nBut, again, we are in the midst of massive change.\n\n00:12:44.958 --> 00:12:47.958\nAnd that change is forcing us to question\n\n00:12:47.958 --> 00:12:49.958\nquite fundamental aspects of our society --\n\n00:12:49.958 --> 00:12:52.958\nhow we keep ourselves healthy, how we govern ourselves,\n\n00:12:52.958 --> 00:12:56.958\nhow we educate ourselves, how we keep ourselves secure.\n\n00:12:56.958 --> 00:12:59.958\nAnd in these times of change, we need these new choices\n\n00:12:59.958 --> 00:13:04.958\nbecause our existing solutions are simply becoming obsolete.\n\n00:13:04.958 --> 00:13:06.958\nSo why design thinking?\n\n00:13:06.958 --> 00:13:09.958\nBecause it gives us a new way of tackling problems.\n\n00:13:09.958 --> 00:13:14.958\nInstead of defaulting to our normal convergent approach\n\n00:13:14.958 --> 00:13:18.958\nwhere we make the best choice out of available alternatives,\n\n00:13:18.958 --> 00:13:21.958\nit encourages us to take a divergent approach,\n\n00:13:21.958 --> 00:13:23.958\nto explore new alternatives, new solutions,\n\n00:13:23.958 --> 00:13:27.958\nnew ideas that have not existed before.\n\n00:13:27.958 --> 00:13:29.958\nBut before we go through that process of divergence,\n\n00:13:29.958 --> 00:13:32.958\nthere is actually quite an important first step.\n\n00:13:32.958 --> 00:13:35.958\nAnd that is, what is the question that we're trying to answer?\n\n00:13:35.958 --> 00:13:37.958\nWhat's the design brief?\n\n00:13:37.958 --> 00:13:39.958\nNow Brunel may have asked a question like this,\n\n00:13:39.958 --> 00:13:43.958\n\"How do I take a train from London to New York?\"\n\n00:13:43.958 --> 00:13:47.958\nBut what are the kinds of questions that we might ask today?\n\n00:13:47.958 --> 00:13:53.958\nSo these are some that we've been asked to think about recently.\n\n00:13:53.958 --> 00:13:56.958\nAnd one in particular, is one that we're working on with the Acumen Fund,\n\n00:13:56.958 --> 00:14:00.958\nin a project that's been funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.\n\n00:14:00.958 --> 00:14:03.958\nHow might we improve access to safe drinking water\n\n00:14:03.958 --> 00:14:05.958\nfor the world's poorest people,\n\n00:14:05.958 --> 00:14:07.958\nand at the same time stimulate innovation\n\n00:14:07.958 --> 00:14:11.958\namongst local water providers?\n\n00:14:11.958 --> 00:14:13.958\nSo instead of having a bunch of American designers\n\n00:14:13.958 --> 00:14:16.958\ncome up with new ideas that may or may not have been appropriate,\n\n00:14:16.958 --> 00:14:20.958\nwe took a sort of more open, collaborative and participative approach.\n\n00:14:20.958 --> 00:14:23.958\nWe teamed designers and investment experts up with\n\n00:14:23.958 --> 00:14:26.958\n11 water organizations across India.\n\n00:14:26.958 --> 00:14:28.958\nAnd through workshops they developed\n\n00:14:28.958 --> 00:14:31.958\ninnovative new products, services, and business models.\n\n00:14:31.958 --> 00:14:33.958\nWe hosted a competition\n\n00:14:33.958 --> 00:14:35.958\nand then funded five of those organizations\n\n00:14:35.958 --> 00:14:37.958\nto develop their ideas.\n\n00:14:37.958 --> 00:14:39.958\nSo they developed and iterated these ideas.\n\n00:14:39.958 --> 00:14:42.958\nAnd then IDEO and Acumen spent several weeks working with them\n\n00:14:42.958 --> 00:14:47.958\nto help design new social marketing campaigns,\n\n00:14:47.958 --> 00:14:50.958\ncommunity outreach strategies, business models,\n\n00:14:50.958 --> 00:14:52.958\nnew water vessels for storing water\n\n00:14:52.958 --> 00:14:55.958\nand carts for delivering water.\n\n00:14:55.958 --> 00:14:57.958\nSome of those ideas are just getting launched into the market.\n\n00:14:57.958 --> 00:14:59.958\nAnd the same process is just getting underway\n\n00:14:59.958 --> 00:15:02.958\nwith NGOs in East Africa.\n\n00:15:02.958 --> 00:15:05.958\nSo for me, this project shows\n\n00:15:05.958 --> 00:15:07.958\nkind of how far we can go from\n\n00:15:07.958 --> 00:15:09.958\nsome of those sort of small things\n\n00:15:09.958 --> 00:15:11.958\nthat I was working on\n\n00:15:11.958 --> 00:15:13.958\nat the beginning of my career.\n\n00:15:13.958 --> 00:15:17.958\nThat by focusing on the needs of humans\n\n00:15:17.958 --> 00:15:19.958\nand by using prototypes\n\n00:15:19.958 --> 00:15:21.958\nto move ideas along quickly,\n\n00:15:21.958 --> 00:15:24.958\nby getting the process out of the hands of designers,\n\n00:15:24.958 --> 00:15:27.958\nand by getting the active participation of the community,\n\n00:15:27.958 --> 00:15:30.958\nwe can tackle bigger and more interesting questions.\n\n00:15:30.958 --> 00:15:33.958\nAnd just like Brunel, by focusing on systems,\n\n00:15:33.958 --> 00:15:36.958\nwe can have a bigger impact.\n\n00:15:36.958 --> 00:15:39.958\nSo that's one thing that we've been working on.\n\n00:15:39.958 --> 00:15:42.958\nI'm actually really quite interested, and perhaps more interested\n\n00:15:42.958 --> 00:15:46.958\nto know what this community thinks we could work on.\n\n00:15:46.958 --> 00:15:49.958\nWhat kinds of questions do we think\n\n00:15:49.958 --> 00:15:52.958\ndesign thinking could be used to tackle?\n\n00:15:52.958 --> 00:15:54.958\nAnd if you've got any ideas\n\n00:15:54.958 --> 00:15:56.958\nthen feel free, you can post them to Twitter.\n\n00:15:56.958 --> 00:15:59.958\nThere is a hash tag there that you can use, #CBDQ.\n\n00:15:59.958 --> 00:16:02.958\nAnd the list looked something like this a little while ago.\n\n00:16:02.958 --> 00:16:06.958\nAnd of course you can search to find the questions that you're interested in\n\n00:16:06.958 --> 00:16:08.958\nby using the same hash code.\n\n00:16:08.958 --> 00:16:12.958\nSo I'd like to believe that design thinking\n\n00:16:12.958 --> 00:16:14.958\nactually can make a

been feeling frustrated, because as a religious historian, I've become acutely aware of the centrality of compassion in all the major world faiths. Every single one of them has evolved their own version of what's been called the Golden Rule. Sometimes it comes in a positive version \u2014 \"Always treat all others as you'd like to be treated yourself.\" And equally important is the negative version \u2014 \"Don't do to others what you would not like them to do to you.\" Look into your own heart, discover what it is that gives you pain and then refuse, under any circumstance whatsoever, to inflict that pain on anybody else.And people have emphasized the importance of compassion, not just because it sounds good, but because it works. People have found that when they have implemented the Golden Rule as Confucius said, \"all day and every day,\" not just a question of doing your good deed for the day and then returning to a life of greed and egotism, but to do it all day and every day, you dethrone yourself from the center of your world, put another there, and you transcend yourself. And it brings you into the presence of what's been called God, Nirvana, Rama, Tao. Something that goes beyond what we know in our ego-bound existence.But you know you'd never know it a lot of the time, that this was so central to the religious life. Because with a few wonderful exceptions, very often when religious people come together, religious leaders come together, they're arguing about abstruse doctrines or uttering a council of hatred or inveighing against homosexuality or something of that sort. Often people don't really want to be compassionate. I sometimes see when I'm speaking to a congregation of religious people a sort of mutinous expression crossing their faces because people often want to be right instead. And that of course defeats the object of the exercise.Now why was I so grateful to TED? Because they took me very gently from my book-lined study and brought me into the 21st century, enabling me to speak to a much, much wider audience than I could have ever conceived. Because I feel an urgency about this. If we don't manage to implement the Golden Rule globally, so that we treat all peoples, wherever and whoever they may be, as though they were as important as ourselves, I doubt that we'll have a viable world to hand on to the next generation.The task of our time, one of the great tasks of our time, is to build a global society, as I said, where people can live together in peace. And the religions that should be making a major contribution are instead seen as part of the problem. And of course it's not just religious people who believe in the Golden Rule. This is the source of all morality, this imaginative act of empathy, putting yourself in the place of another.And so we have a choice, it seems to me. We can either go on bringing out or emphasizing the dogmatic and intolerant aspects of our faith, or we can go back to the rabbis. Rabbi Hillel, the older contemporary of Jesus, who, when asked by a pagan to sum up the whole of Jewish teaching while he stood on one leg, said, \"That which is hateful to you, do not do to your neighbor. That is the Torah and everything else is only commentary.\"And the rabbis and the early fathers of the church who said that any interpretation of scripture that bred hatred and disdain was illegitimate. And we need to revive that spirit. And it's not just going to happen because a spirit of love wafts us down. We have to make this happen, and we can do it with the modern communications that TED has introduced. Already I've been tremendously heartened at the response of all our partners.In Singapore, we have a group going to use the Charter to heal divisions recently that have sprung up in Singaporean society, and some members of the parliament want to implement it politically. In Malaysia, there is going to be an art exhibition in which leading artists are going to be taking people, young people, and showing them that compassion also lies at the root of all art. Throughout Europe, the Muslim communities are holding events and discussions, are discussing the centrality of compassion in Islam and in all faiths.But it can't stop there. It can't stop with the launch. Religious teaching, this is where we've gone so wrong, concentrating solely on believing abstruse doctrines. Religious teaching must always lead to action. And I intend to work on this till my dying day. And I want to continue with our partners to do two things \u2014 educate and stimulate compassionate thinking. Education because we've so dropped out of compassion. People often think it simply means feeling sorry for somebody. But of course you don't understand compassion if you're just going to think about it. You also have to do it.I want them to get the media involved because the media are crucial in helping to dissolve some of the stereotypical views we have of other people, which are dividing us from one another. The same applies to educators. I'd like youth to get a sense of the dynamism, the dynamic and challenge of a compassionate lifestyle. And also see that it demands acute intelligence, not just a gooey feeling.I'd like to call upon scholars to explore the compassionate theme in their own and in other people's traditions. And perhaps above all, to encourage a sensitivity about uncompassionate speaking, so that because people have this Charter, whatever their beliefs or lack of them, they feel empowered to challenge uncompassionate speech, disdainful remarks from their religious leaders, their political leaders, from the captains of industry. Because we can change the world, we have the ability.I would never have thought of putting the Charter online. I was still stuck in the old world of a whole bunch of boffins sitting together in a room and issuing yet another arcane statement. And TED introduced me to a whole new way of thinking and presenting ideas. Because that is what is so wonderful about TED. In this room, all this expertise, if we joined it all together, we could change the world. And of course the problems sometimes seem insuperable.But I'd just like to quote, finish at the end with a reference to a British author, an Oxford author whom I don't quote very often, C.S. Lewis. But he wrote one thing that stuck in my mind ever since I read it when I was a schoolgirl. It's in his book \"The Four Loves.\" He said that he distinguished between erotic love, when two people gaze, spellbound, into each other's eyes. And then he compared that to friendship, when two people stand side by side, as it were, shoulder to shoulder, with their eyes fixed on a common goal.We don't have to fall in love with each other, but we can become friends. And I am convinced. I felt it very strongly during our little deliberations at Vevey, that when people of all different persuasions come together, working side by side for a common goal, differences melt away. And we learn amity. And we learn to live together and to get to know one another. Thank you very much.

I'm a spectroscopist. I have to talk about astronomy without showing you any single image of nebulae or galaxies, etc. because my job is spectroscopy. I never deal with images. But I'll try to convince you that spectroscopy is actually something which can change this world. Spectroscopy can probably answer the question, \"Is there anybody out there?\" Are we alone? SETI. It's not very fun to do spectroscopy.One of my colleagues in Bulgaria, Nevena Markova, spent about 20 years studying these profiles. And she published 42 articles just dedicated to the subject. Can you imagine? Day and night, thinking, observing, the same star for 20 years is incredible. But we are crazy. We do these things. (Laughter)And I'm not that far. I spent about eight months working on these profiles. Because I've noticed a very small symmetry in the profile of one of the planet host stars. And I thought, well maybe there is Lithium-6 in this star, which is an indication that this star has swallowed a planet. Because apparently you can't have this fragile isotope of Lithium-6 in the atmospheres of sun-like stars. But you have it in planets and asteroids. So if you engulf planet or large number of asteroids, you will have this Lithium-6 isotope in the spectrum of the star. So I invested more than eight months just studying the profile of this star.And actually it's amazing, because I got phone calls from many reporters asking, \"Have you actually seen the planet going into a star?\" Because they thought that if you are having a telescope, you are an astronomer so what you are doing is actually looking in a telescope. And you might have seen the planet going into a star. And I was saying, \"No, excuse me. What I see is this one.\" (Laughter) It's just incredible. Because nobody understood really. I bet that there were very few people who really understood what I'm talking about. Because this is the indication that the planet went into the star. It's amazing.The power of spectroscopy was actually realized by Pink Floyd already in 1973. (Laughter) Because they actually said that you can get any color you like in a spectrum. And all you need is time and money to make your spectrograph. This is the number one high resolution, most precise spectrograph on this planet, called HARPS, which is actually used to detect extrasolar planets and sound waves in the atmospheres of stars.How we get spectra? I'm sure most of you know from school physics that it's basically splitting a white light into colors. And if you have a liquid hot mass, it will produce something which we call a continuous spectrum. A hot gas is producing emission lines only, no continuum. And if you place a cool gas in front of a hot source, you will see certain patterns which we call absorption lines. Which is used actually to identify chemical elements in a cool matter, which is absorbing exactly at those frequencies.Now, what we can do with the spectra? We can actually study line-of-sight velocities of cosmic objects. And we can also study chemical composition and physical parameters of stars, galaxies, nebulae. A star is the most simple object. In the core, we have thermonuclear reactions going on, creating chemical elements. And we have a cool atmosphere. It's cool for me. Cool in my terms is three or four or five thousand degrees. My colleagues in infra-red astronomy call minus 200 Kelvin is cool for them. But you know, everything is relative. So for me 5,000 degrees is pretty cool. (Laughter)This is the spectrum of the Sun \u2014 24,000 spectral lines, and about 15 percent of these lines is not yet identified. It is amazing. So we are in the 21st century, and we still cannot properly understand the spectrum of the sun. Sometimes we have to deal with just one tiny, weak spectral line to measure the composition of that chemical element in the atmosphere. For instance, you see the spectral line of the gold is the only spectral line in the spectrum of the Sun. And we use this weak feature to measure the composition of gold in the atmosphere of the Sun.And now this is a work in progress. We have been dealing with a similarly very weak feature, which belongs to osmium. It's a heavy element produced in thermonuclear explosions of supernovae. It's the only place where you can produce, actually, osmium. Just comparing the composition of osmium in one of the planet host stars, we want to understand why there is so much of this element. Perhaps we even think that maybe supernova explosions trigger formations of planets and stars. It can be an indication.The other day, my colleague from Berkeley, Gibor Basri, emailed me a very interesting spectrum, asking me, \"Can you have a look at this?\" And I couldn't sleep, next two weeks, when I saw the huge amount of oxygen and other elements in the spectrum of the stars. I knew that there is nothing like that observed in the galaxy. It was incredible. The only conclusion we could make from this is clear evidence that there was a supernova explosion in this system, which polluted the atmosphere of this star. And later a black hole was formed in a binary system, which is still there with a mass of about five solar masses. This was considered as first evidence that actually black holes come from supernovae explosions.My colleagues, comparing composition of chemical elements in different galactic stars, actually discovered alien stars in our galaxy. It's amazing that you can go so far simply studying the chemical composition of stars. They actually said that one of the stars you see in the spectra is an alien. It comes from a different galaxy. There is interaction of galaxies. We know this. And sometimes they just capture stars.You've heard about solar flares. We were very surprised to discover a super flare, a flare which is thousands of millions of times more powerful than those we see in the Sun. In one of the binary stars in our galaxy called FH Leo, we discovered the super flare. And later we went to study the spectral stars to see is there anything strange with these objects. And we found that everything is normal. These stars are normal like the Sun. Age, everything was normal. So this is a mystery. It's one of the mysteries we still have, super flares. And there are six or seven similar cases reported in the literature.Now to go ahead with this, we really need to understand chemical evolution of the universe. It's very complicated. I don't really want you to try to understand what is here. (Laughter) But it's to show you how complicated is the whole story of the production of chemical elements. You have two channels \u2014 the massive stars and low-mass stars \u2014 producing and recycling matter and chemical elements in the universe. And doing this for 14 billion years, we end up with this picture, which is a very important graph, showing relative abundances of chemical elements in sun-like stars and in the interstellar medium.So which means that it's really impossible to find an object where you find about 10 times more sulfur than silicon, five times more calcium than oxygen. It's just impossible. And if you find one, I will say that this is something related to SETI, because naturally you can't do it. Doppler Effect is something very important from fundamental physics. And this is related to the change of the frequency of a moving source. The Doppler Effect is used to discover extrasolar planets.The precision which we need to discover a Jupiter-like planet around a sun-like star is something like 28.4 meters per second. And we need nine centimeters per second to detect an Earth-like planet. This can be done with the future spectrographs. I, myself, I'm actually involved in the team which is developing a CODEX, high resolution, future generation spectrograph for the 42 meter E-ELT telescope. And this is going to be an instrument to detect Earth-like planets around sun-like stars. It is an amazing tool called astroseismology where we can detect sound waves in the atmospheres of stars.This is the sound of an Alpha Cen. We can detect sound waves in the atmospheres of sun-like stars. Those waves have frequencies in infrasound domain, the sound actually nobody knows, domain. Coming back to the most important question, \"Is there anybody out there?\" This is closely related to tectonic and volcanic activity of planets. Connection between life and radioactive nuclei is straightforward. No life without tectonic activity, without volcanic activity. And we know very well that geothermal energy is mostly produced by decay of uranium, thorium, and potassium.How to measure, if we have planets where the amount of those elements is small, so those planets are tectonically dead, there cannot be life. If there is too much uranium or potassium or thorium, probably, again, there would be no life. Because can you imagine everything boiling? It's too much energy on a planet. Now, we have been measuring abundance of thorium in one of the stars with extrasolar planets. It's exactly the same game. A very tiny feature.We are actually trying to measure this profile and to detect thorium. It's very tough. It's very tough. And you have to, first you have to convince yourself. Then you have to convince your colleagues. And then you have to convince the whole world that you have actually detected something like this in the atmosphere of an extrasolar planet host star somewhere in 100 parsec away from here. It's really difficult. But if you want to know about a life on extrasolar planets, you have to do this job. Because you have to know how much of radioactive element you have in those systems.The one way to discover about aliens is to tune your radio telescope and listen to the signals. If you receive something interesting, well that's what SETI does actually, what SETI has been doing for many years. I think the most promising way is to go for biomarkers. You can see the spectrum of the Earth, this Earthshine spectrum, and that is a very clear signal. The slope which is coming, which we call a Red Edge, is a detection of vegetated area. It's amazing that we can detect vegetation from a spectrum. Now imagine doing this test for other planets.Now very recently, very recently, I'm talking about last six, seven, eight months, water, methane, carbon dioxide have been detected in the spectrum of a planet outside the solar system. It's amazing. So this is the power of spectroscopy. You can actually go and detect and study a chemical composition of planets far, far, far from solar system. We have to detect oxygen or ozone to make sure that we have all necessary conditions to have life.Cosmic miracles are something which can be related to SETI. Now imagine an object, amazing object, or something which we cannot explain when we just stand up and say, \"Look, we give up. Physics doesn't work.\" So it's something which you can always refer to SETI and say, \"Well, somebody must be doing this, somehow.\"And with the known physics etc, it's something actually which has been pointed out by Frank Drake, many years ago, and Shklovsky. If you see, in the spectrum of a planet host star, if you see strange chemical elements, it can be a signal from a civilization which is there and they want to signal about it. They want to actually signal their presence through these spectral lines, in the spectrum of a star, in different ways.There can be different ways doing this. One is, for instance, technetium is a radioactive element with a decay time of 4.2 million years. If you suddenly observe technetium in a sun-like star, you can be sure that somebody has put this element in the atmosphere, because in a natural way it is impossible to do this. Now we are reviewing the spectra of about 300 stars with extrasolar planets. And we are doing this job since 2000 and it's a very heavy project. We have been working very hard. And we have some interesting cases, candidates, so on, things which we can't really explain. And I hope in the near future we can confirm this.So the main question: \"Are we alone?\" I think it will not come from UFOs. It will not come from radio signals. I think it will come from a spectrum like this. It is the spectrum of a planet like Earth, showing a presence of nitrogen dioxide, as a clear signal of life, and oxygen and ozone. If, one day, and I think it will be within 15 years from now, or 20 years. If we discover a spectrum like this we can be sure that there is life on that planet. In about five years we will discover planets like Earth, around sun-like stars, the same distance as the Earth from the Sun. It will take about five years. And then we will need another 10, 15 years with space projects to get the spectra of Earth-like planets like the one I showed you. And if we see the nitrogen dioxide and oxygen, I think we have the perfect E.T. Thank you very much.

The only conclusion we could make from this\n\n00:06:12.958 --> 00:06:15.958\nis clear evidence that there was a supernova explosion\n\n00:06:15.958 --> 00:06:18.958\nin this system, which polluted the atmosphere\n\n00:06:18.958 --> 00:06:20.958\nof this star.\n\n00:06:20.958 --> 00:06:22.958\nAnd later a black hole was formed\n\n00:06:22.958 --> 00:06:24.958\nin a binary system,\n\n00:06:24.958 --> 00:06:26.958\nwhich is still there with a mass of about\n\n00:06:26.958 --> 00:06:28.958\nfive solar masses.\n\n00:06:28.958 --> 00:06:31.958\nThis was considered as first evidence that actually black holes\n\n00:06:31.958 --> 00:06:35.958\ncome from supernovae explosions.\n\n00:06:35.958 --> 00:06:37.958\nMy colleagues, comparing composition of chemical elements\n\n00:06:37.958 --> 00:06:39.958\nin different galactic stars,\n\n00:06:39.958 --> 00:06:43.958\nactually discovered alien stars in our galaxy.\n\n00:06:43.958 --> 00:06:46.958\nIt's amazing that you can go so far\n\n00:06:46.958 --> 00:06:50.958\nsimply studying the chemical composition of stars.\n\n00:06:50.958 --> 00:06:53.958\nThey actually said that one of the stars you see in the spectra\n\n00:06:53.958 --> 00:06:56.958\nis an alien. It comes from a different galaxy.\n\n00:06:56.958 --> 00:06:59.958\nThere is interaction of galaxies. We know this.\n\n00:06:59.958 --> 00:07:04.958\nAnd sometimes they just capture stars.\n\n00:07:04.958 --> 00:07:07.958\nYou've heard about solar flares.\n\n00:07:07.958 --> 00:07:09.958\nWe were very surprised to discover\n\n00:07:09.958 --> 00:07:11.958\na super flare,\n\n00:07:11.958 --> 00:07:15.958\na flare which is thousands of millions of times\n\n00:07:15.958 --> 00:07:17.958\nmore powerful than those we see in the Sun.\n\n00:07:17.958 --> 00:07:20.958\nIn one of the binary stars in our galaxy\n\n00:07:20.958 --> 00:07:22.958\ncalled FH Leo,\n\n00:07:22.958 --> 00:07:24.958\nwe discovered the super flare.\n\n00:07:24.958 --> 00:07:28.958\nAnd later we went to study the spectral stars\n\n00:07:28.958 --> 00:07:30.958\nto see is there anything strange with these objects.\n\n00:07:30.958 --> 00:07:33.958\nAnd we found that everything is normal.\n\n00:07:33.958 --> 00:07:36.958\nThese stars are normal like the Sun. Age, everything was normal.\n\n00:07:36.958 --> 00:07:38.958\nSo this is a mystery.\n\n00:07:38.958 --> 00:07:41.958\nIt's one of the mysteries we still have, super flares.\n\n00:07:41.958 --> 00:07:44.958\nAnd there are six or seven similar cases\n\n00:07:44.958 --> 00:07:46.958\nreported in the literature.\n\n00:07:46.958 --> 00:07:48.958\nNow to go ahead with this,\n\n00:07:48.958 --> 00:07:52.958\nwe really need to understand chemical evolution of the universe.\n\n00:07:52.958 --> 00:07:54.958\nIt's very complicated. I don't really want you to\n\n00:07:54.958 --> 00:07:58.958\ntry to understand what is here.\n\n00:07:58.958 --> 00:07:59.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:07:59.958 --> 00:08:02.958\nBut it's to show you how complicated is the whole story\n\n00:08:02.958 --> 00:08:04.958\nof the production of chemical elements.\n\n00:08:04.958 --> 00:08:06.958\nYou have two channels --\n\n00:08:06.958 --> 00:08:08.958\nthe massive stars and low-mass stars --\n\n00:08:08.958 --> 00:08:11.958\nproducing and recycling matter and chemical elements in the universe.\n\n00:08:11.958 --> 00:08:14.958\nAnd doing this for 14 billion years,\n\n00:08:14.958 --> 00:08:16.958\nwe end up with this picture,\n\n00:08:16.958 --> 00:08:18.958\nwhich is a very important graph,\n\n00:08:18.958 --> 00:08:21.958\nshowing relative abundances of chemical elements\n\n00:08:21.958 --> 00:08:23.958\nin sun-like stars\n\n00:08:23.958 --> 00:08:26.958\nand in the interstellar medium.\n\n00:08:26.958 --> 00:08:28.958\nSo which means that it's really impossible\n\n00:08:28.958 --> 00:08:33.958\nto find an object where you find about 10 times more sulfur than silicon,\n\n00:08:33.958 --> 00:08:37.958\nfive times more calcium than oxygen. It's just impossible.\n\n00:08:37.958 --> 00:08:39.958\nAnd if you find one, I will say that\n\n00:08:39.958 --> 00:08:42.958\nthis is something related to SETI,\n\n00:08:42.958 --> 00:08:46.958\nbecause naturally you can't do it.\n\n00:08:46.958 --> 00:08:48.958\nDoppler Effect is something very important\n\n00:08:48.958 --> 00:08:50.958\nfrom fundamental physics.\n\n00:08:50.958 --> 00:08:52.958\nAnd this is related to the change of the frequency\n\n00:08:52.958 --> 00:08:54.958\nof a moving source.\n\n00:08:54.958 --> 00:08:59.958\nThe Doppler Effect is used to discover extrasolar planets.\n\n00:08:59.958 --> 00:09:01.958\nThe precision which we need\n\n00:09:01.958 --> 00:09:03.958\nto discover a Jupiter-like planet\n\n00:09:03.958 --> 00:09:05.958\naround a sun-like star\n\n00:09:05.958 --> 00:09:09.958\nis something like 28.4 meters per second.\n\n00:09:09.958 --> 00:09:11.958\nAnd we need nine centimeters per second\n\n00:09:11.958 --> 00:09:14.958\nto detect an Earth-like planet.\n\n00:09:14.958 --> 00:09:17.958\nThis can be done with the future spectrographs.\n\n00:09:17.958 --> 00:09:21.958\nI, myself, I'm actually involved in the team\n\n00:09:21.958 --> 00:09:23.958\nwhich is developing a CODEX,\n\n00:09:23.958 --> 00:09:25.958\nhigh resolution, future generation spectrograph\n\n00:09:25.958 --> 00:09:29.958\nfor the 42 meter E-ELT telescope.\n\n00:09:29.958 --> 00:09:32.958\nAnd this is going to be an instrument\n\n00:09:32.958 --> 00:09:34.958\nto detect Earth-like planets\n\n00:09:34.958 --> 00:09:36.958\naround sun-like stars.\n\n00:09:36.958 --> 00:09:39.958\nIt is an amazing tool called astroseismology\n\n00:09:39.958 --> 00:09:42.958\nwhere we can detect sound waves\n\n00:09:42.958 --> 00:09:44.958\nin the atmospheres of stars.\n\n00:09:44.958 --> 00:09:47.958\nThis is the sound of an Alpha Cen.\n\n00:09:47.958 --> 00:09:49.958\nWe can detect sound waves\n\n00:09:49.958 --> 00:09:51.958\nin the atmospheres of sun-like stars.\n\n00:09:51.958 --> 00:09:54.958\nThose waves have frequencies\n\n00:09:54.958 --> 00:09:58.958\nin infrasound domain, the sound actually nobody knows, domain.\n\n00:09:58.958 --> 00:10:00.958\nComing back to the most important question,\n\n00:10:00.958 --> 00:10:02.958\n\"Is there anybody out there?\"\n\n00:10:02.958 --> 00:10:04.958\nThis is closely related\n\n00:10:04.958 --> 00:10:08.958\nto tectonic and volcanic activity of planets.\n\n00:10:08.958 --> 00:10:10.958\nConnection between life\n\n00:10:10.958 --> 00:10:12.958\nand radioactive nuclei\n\n00:10:12.958 --> 00:10:14.958\nis straightforward.\n\n00:10:14.958 --> 00:10:17.958\nNo life without tectonic activity,\n\n00:10:17.958 --> 00:10:19.958\nwithout volcanic activity.\n\n00:10:19.958 --> 00:10:21.958\nAnd we know very well that geothermal energy\n\n00:10:21.958 --> 00:10:26.958\nis mostly produced by decay of uranium, thorium, and potassium.\n\n00:10:26.958 --> 00:10:30.958\nHow to measure, if we have planets\n\n00:10:30.958 --> 00:10:34.958\nwhere the amount of those elements is small,\n\n00:10:34.958 --> 00:10:37.958\nso those planets are tectonically dead,\n\n00:10:37.958 --> 00:10:39.958\nthere cannot be life.\n\n00:10:39.958 --> 00:10:42.958\nIf there is too much uranium or potassium or thorium,\n\n00:10:42.958 --> 00:10:45.958\nprobably, again, there would be no life.\n\n00:10:45.958 --> 00:10:47.958\nBecause can you imagine everything boiling?\n\n00:10:47.958 --> 00:10:49.958\nIt's too much energy on a planet.\n\n00:10:49.958 --> 00:10:51.958\nNow, we have been measuring abundance\n\n00:10:51.958 --> 00:10:55.958\nof thorium in one of the stars with extrasolar planets.\n\n00:10:55.958 --> 00:10:59.958\nIt's exactly the same game. A very tiny feature.\n\n00:10:59.958 --> 00:11:01.958\nWe are actually trying to measure this profile\n\n00:11:01.958 --> 00:11:03.958\nand to detect thorium.\n\n00:11:03.958 --> 00:11:05.958\nIt's very tough. It's very tough.\n\n00:11:05.958 --> 00:11:07.958\nAnd you have to, first you have to convince yourself.\n\n00:11:07.958 --> 00:11:09.958\nThen you have to convince your colleagues.\n\n00:11:09.958 --> 00:11:12.958\nAnd then you have to convince the whole world\n\n00:11:12.958 --> 00:11:15.958\nthat you have actually detected something like this\n\n00:11:15.958 --> 00:11:17.958\nin the atmosphere of an extrasolar planet\n\n00:11:17.958 --> 00:11:20.958\nhost star somewhere in 100 parsec away from here.\n\n00:11:20.958 --> 00:11:22.958\nIt's really difficult.\n\n00:11:22.958 --> 00:11:27.958\nBut if you want to know about a life on extrasolar planets,\n\n00:11:27.958 --> 00:11:29.958\nyou have to do this job.\n\n00:11:29.958 --> 00:11:32.958\nBecause you have to know how much of radioactive element you have\n\n00:11:32.958 --> 00:11:34.958\nin those systems.\n\n00:11:34.958 --> 00:11:37.958\nThe one way to discover about aliens\n\n00:11:37.958 --> 00:11:41.958\nis to tune your radio telescope and listen to the signals.\n\n00:11:41.958 --> 00:11:44.958\nIf you receive something interesting,\n\n00:11:44.958 --> 00:11:46.958\nwell that's what SETI does actually,\n\n00:11:46.958 --> 00:11:49.958\nwhat SETI has been doing for many years.\n\n00:11:49.958 --> 00:11:51.958\nI think the most promising way\n\n00:11:51.958 --> 00:11:54.958\nis to go for biomarkers.\n\n00:11:54.958 --> 00:11:57.958\nYou can see the spectrum of the Earth, this Earthshine spectrum,\n\n00:11:57.958 --> 00:12:00.958\nand that is a very clear signal.\n\n00:12:00.958 --> 00:12:03.958\nThe slope which is coming, which we call a Red Edge,\n\n00:12:03.958 --> 00:12:07.958\nis a detection of vegetated area.\n\n00:12:07.958 --> 00:12:11.958\nIt's amazing that we can detect vegetation\n\n00:12:11.958 --> 00:12:13.958\nfrom a spectrum.\n\n00:12:13.958 --> 00:12:15.958\nNow imagine doing this test\n\n00:12:15.958 --> 00:12:18.958\nfor other planets.\n\n00:12:18.958 --> 00:12:21.958\nNow very recently, very recently,\n\n00:12:21.958 --> 00:12:24.958\nI'm talking about last six, seven, eight months,\n\n00:12:24.958 --> 00:12:28.958\nwater, methane, carbon dioxide\n\n00:12:28.958 --> 00:12:30.958\nhave been detected in the spectrum\n\n00:12:30.958 --> 00:12:33.958\nof a planet outside the solar system.\n\n00:12:33.958 --> 00:12:37.958\nIt's amazing. So this is the power of spectroscopy.\n\n00:12:37.958 --> 00:12:40.958\nYou can actually go and detect\n\n00:12:40.958 --> 00:12:43.958\nand study a chemical composition of planets\n\n00:12:43.958 --> 00:12:46.958\nfar, far, far from solar system.\n\n00:12:46.958 --> 00:12:49.958\nWe have to detect oxygen or ozone\n\n00:12:49.958 --> 00:12:52.958\nto make sure that we have all necessary conditions\n\n00:12:52.958 --> 00:12:56.958\nto have life.\n\n00:12:56.958 --> 00:12:58.958\nCosmic miracles are something\n\n00:12:58.958 --> 00:13:00.958\nwhich can be related to SETI.\n\n00:13:00.958 --> 00:13:02.958\nNow imagine an object, amazing object,\n\n00:13:02.958 --> 00:13:04.958\nor something which we cannot explain\n\n00:13:04.958 --> 00:13:06.958\nwhen we just stand up and say,\n\n00:13:06.958 --> 00:13:08.958\n\"Look, we give up. Physics doesn't work.\"\n\n00:13:08.958 --> 00:13:11.958\nSo it's something which you can always refer to SETI and say,\n\n00:13:11.958 --> 00:13:16.958\n\"Well, somebody must be doing this, somehow.\"\n\n00:13:16.958 --> 00:13:18.958\nAnd with the known physics etc,\n\n00:13:18.958 --> 00:13:20.958\nit's something actually which has been pointed out\n\n00:13:20.958 --> 00:13:22.958\nby Frank Drake,\n\n00:13:22.958 --> 00:13:24.958\nmany years ago, and Shklovsky.\n\n00:13:24.958 --> 00:13:27.958\nIf you see, in the spectrum of a planet host star,\n\n00:13:27.958 --> 00:13:31.958\nif you see strange chemical elements,\n\n00:13:31.958 --> 00:13:34.958\nit can be a signal from a civilization\n\n00:13:34.958 --> 00:13:37.958\nwhich is there and they want to signal about it.\n\n00:13:37.958 --> 00:13:41.958\nThey want to actually signal their presence\n\n00:13:41.958 --> 00:13:43.958\nthrough these spectral lines,\n\n00:13:43.958 --> 00:13:46.958\nin the spectrum of a star, in different ways.\n\n00:13:46.958 --> 00:13:48.958\nThere can be different ways doing this.\n\n00:13:48.958 --> 00:13:50.958\nOne is, for instance, technetium\n\n00:13:50.958 --> 00:13:52.958\nis a radioactive element\n\n00:13:52.958 --> 00:13:55.958\nwith a decay time of 4.2 million years.\n\n00:13:55.958 --> 00:13:58.958\nIf you suddenly observe technetium\n\n00:13:58.958 --> 00:14:00.958\nin a sun-like star,\n\n00:14:00.958 --> 00:14:02.958\nyou can be sure that somebody has put this\n\n00:14:02.958 --> 00:14:04.958\nelement in the atmosphere,\n\n00:14:04.958 --> 00:14:08.958\nbecause in a natural way it is impossible to do this.\n\n00:14:08.958 --> 00:14:11.958\nNow we are reviewing the spectra of about\n\n00:14:11.958 --> 00:14:14.958\n300 stars with extrasolar planets.\n\n00:14:14.958 --> 00:14:18.958\nAnd we are doing this job since 2000\n\n00:14:18.958 --> 00:14:21.958\nand it's a very heavy project.\n\n00:14:21.958 --> 00:14:23.958\nWe have been working very hard.\n\n00:14:23.958 --> 00:14:27.958\nAnd we have some interesting cases,\n\n00:14:27.958 --> 00:14:31.958\ncandidates, so on, things which we can't really explain.\n\n00:14:31.958 --> 00:14:34.958\nAnd I hope in the near future\n\n00:14:34.958 --> 00:14:36.958\nwe can confirm this.\n\n00:14:36.958 --> 00:14:38.958\nSo the main question: \"Are we alone?\"\n\n00:14:38.958 --> 00:14:41.958\nI think it will not come from UFOs.\n\n00:14:41.958 --> 00:14:45.958\nIt will not come from radio signals.\n\n00:14:45.958 --> 00:14:49.958\nI think it will come from a spectrum like this.\n\n00:14:49.958 --> 00:14:54.958\nIt is the spectrum of a planet like Earth,\n\n00:14:54.958 --> 00:14:57.958\nshowing a presence of nitrogen dioxide,\n\n00:14:57.958 --> 00:15:00.958\nas a clear signal of life,\n\n00:15:00.958 --> 00:15:02.958\nand oxygen and ozone.\n\n00:15:02.958 --> 00:15:04.958\nIf, one day, and I think it will be\n\n00:15:04.958 --> 00:15:07.958\nwithin 15 years from now, or 20 years.\n\n00:15:07.958 --> 00:15:10.958\nIf we discover a spectrum like this\n\n00:15:10.958 --> 00:15:12.958\nwe can be sure that there is life on that planet.\n\n00:15:12.958 --> 00:15:15.958\nIn about five years we will discover\n\n00:15:15.958 --> 00:15:18.958\nplanets like Earth, around sun-like stars,\n\n00:15:18.958 --> 00:15:21.958\nthe same distance as the Earth from the Sun.\n\n00:15:21.958 --> 00:15:23.958\nIt will take about five years.\n\n00:15:23.958 --> 00:15:25.958\nAnd then we will need another 10, 15 years\n\n00:15:25.958 --> 00:15:27.958\nwith space projects\n\n00:15:27.958 --> 00:15:30.958\nto get the spectra of Earth-like planets like the one I showed you.\n\n00:15:30.958 --> 00:15:32.958\nAnd if we see the nitrogen dioxide\n\n00:15:32.958 --> 00:15:34.958\nand oxygen,\n\n00:15:34.958 --> 00:15:36.958\nI think we have the perfect E.T.\n\n00:15:36.958 --> 00:15:38.958\nThank you very much.\n\n00:15:38.958 --> 00:15:42.958\n(Applause)"}, {"title": "The power of time off", "duration": "1060", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/stefan_sagmeister_the_power_of_time_off", "transcript": "I run a design studio in New York. Every seven years, I close it for one year to pursue some little experiments, things that are always difficult to accomplish during the regular working year. In that year, we are not available for any of our clients. We are totally closed. And as you can imagine, it is a lovely and very energetic time.I originally had opened the studio in New York to combine my two loves, music and design. And we created videos and packaging for many musicians that you know, and for even more that you've never heard of. As I realized, just like with many many things in my life that I actually love, I adapt to it. And I get, over time, bored by them. And for sure, in our case, our work started to look the same. You see here a glass eye in a die cut of a book. Quite the similar idea, then, a perfume packaged in a book, in a die cut. So I decided to close it down for one year.Also is the knowledge that right now we spend about in the first 25 years of our lives learning, then there is another 40 years that's really reserved for working. And then tacked on at the end of it are about 15 years for retirement. And I thought it might be helpful to basically cut off five of those retirement years and intersperse them in between those working years. (Applause) That's clearly enjoyable for myself. But probably even more important is that the work that comes out of these years flows back into the company and into society at large, rather than just benefiting a grandchild or two.There is a fellow TEDster who spoke two years ago, Jonathan Haidt, who defined his work into three different levels. And they rang very true for me. I can see my work as a job. I do it for money. I likely already look forward to the weekend on Thursdays. And I probably will need a hobby as a leveling mechanism. In a career I'm definitely more engaged. But at the same time, there will be periods when I think is all that really hard work really worth my while? While in the third one, in the calling, very much likely I would do it also if I wouldn't be financially compensated for it.I am not a religious person myself, but I did look for nature. I had spent my first sabbatical in New York City. Looked for something different for the second one. Europe and the U.S. didn't really feel enticing because I knew them too well. So Asia it was. The most beautiful landscapes I had seen in Asia were Sri Lanka and Bali. Sri Lanka still had the civil war going on, so Bali it was. It's a wonderful, very craft-oriented society.I arrived there in September 2008, and pretty much started to work right away. There is wonderful inspiration coming from the area itself. However the first thing that I needed was mosquito repellent typography because they were definitely around heavily. And then I needed some sort of way to be able to get back to all the wild dogs that surround my house, and attacked me during my morning walks. So we created this series of 99 portraits on tee shirts. Every single dog on one tee shirt. As a little retaliation with a just ever so slightly menacing message (Laughter) on the back of the shirt. (Laughter)Just before I left New York I decided I could actually renovate my studio. And then just leave it all to them. And I don't have to do anything. So I looked for furniture. And it turned out that all the furniture that I really liked, I couldn't afford. And all the stuff I could afford, I didn't like. So one of the things that we pursued in Bali was pieces of furniture. This one, of course, still works with the wild dogs. It's not quite finished yet. And I think by the time this lamp came about, (Laughter) I had finally made peace with those dogs. (Laughter)Then there is a coffee table. I also did a coffee table. It's called Be Here Now. It includes 330 compasses. And we had custom espresso cups made that hide a magnet inside, and make those compasses go crazy, always centering on them. Then this is a fairly talkative, verbose kind of chair. I also started meditating for the first time in my life in Bali. And at the same time, I'm extremely aware how boring it is to hear about other people's happinesses. So I will not really go too far into it.Many of you will know this TEDster, Danny Gilbert, whose book, actually, I got it through the TED book club. I think it took me four years to finally read it, while on sabbatical. And I was pleased to see that he actually wrote the book while he was on sabbatical. And I'll show you a couple of people that did well by pursuing sabbaticals.This is Ferran Adria. Many people think he is right now the best chef in the world with his restaurant north of Barcelona, El Bulli. His restaurant is open seven months every year. He closes it down for five months to experiment with a full kitchen staff. His latest numbers are fairly impressive. He can seat, throughout the year, he can seat 8,000 people. And he has 2.2 million requests for reservations.If I look at my cycle, seven years, one year sabbatical, it's 12.5 percent of my time. And if I look at companies that are actually more successful than mine, 3M since the 1930s is giving all their engineers 15 percent to pursue whatever they want. There is some good successes. Scotch tape came out of this program, as well as Art Fry developed sticky notes from during his personal time for 3M. Google, of course, very famously gives 20 percent for their software engineers to pursue their own personal projects.Anybody in here has actually ever conducted a sabbatical? That's about five percent of everybody. So I'm not sure if you saw your neighbor putting their hand up. Talk to them about if it was successful or not. I've found that finding out about what I'm going to like in the future, my very best way is to talk to people who have actually done it much better than myself envisioning it.When I had the idea of doing one, the process was I made the decision and I put it into my daily planner book. And then I told as many, many people as I possibly could about it so that there was no way that I could chicken out later on. (Laughter)In the beginning, on the first sabbatical, it was rather disastrous. I had thought that I should do this without any plan, that this vacuum of time somehow would be wonderful and enticing for idea generation. It was not. I just, without a plan, I just reacted to little requests, not work requests, those I all said no to, but other little requests. Sending mail to Japanese design magazines and things like that. So I became my own intern. (Laughter)And I very quickly made a list of the things I was interested in, put them in a hierarchy, divided them into chunks of time and then made a plan, very much like in grade school. What does it say here? Monday, 8 to 9: story writing; 9 to 10: future thinking. Was not very successful. And so on and so forth. And that actually, specifically as a starting point of the first sabbatical, worked really well for me. What came out of it? I really got close to design again. I had fun. Financially, seen over the long term, it was actually successful. Because of the improved quality, we could ask for higher prices.And probably most importantly, basically everything we've done in the seven years following the first sabbatical came out of thinking of that one single year. And I'll show you a couple of projects that came out of the seven years following that sabbatical. One of the strands of thinking I was involved in was that sameness is so incredibly overrated. This whole idea that everything needs to be exactly the same works for a very very few strand of companies, and not for everybody else.We were asked to design an identity for Casa da Musica, the Rem Koolhaas-built music center in Porto, in Portugal. And even though I desired to do an identity that doesn't use the architecture, I failed at that. And mostly also because I realized out of a Rem Koolhaas presentation to the city of Porto, where he talked about a conglomeration of various layers of meaning. Which I understood after I translated it from architecture speech in to regular English, basically as logo making. And I understood that the building itself was a logo.So then it became quite easy. We put a mask on it, looked at it deep down in the ground, checked it out from all sides, west, north, south, east, top and bottom. Colored them in a very particular way by having a friend of mine write a piece of software, the Casa da Musica Logo Generator. That's connected to a scanner. You put any image in there, like that Beethoven image. And the software, in a second, will give you the Casa da Musica Beethoven logo. Which, when you actually have to design a Beethoven poster, comes in handy, because the visual information of the logo and the actual poster is exactly the same.So it will always fit together, conceptually, of course. If Zappa's music is performed, it gets its own logo. Or Philip Glass or Lou Reed or the Chemical Brothers, who all performed there, get their own Casa da Musica logo. It works the same internally with the president or the musical director, whose Casa da Musica portraits wind up on their business cards. There is a full-blown orchestra living inside the building. It has a more transparent identity. The truck they go on tour with. Or there's a smaller contemporary orchestra, 12 people that remixes its own title.And one of the handy things that came about was that you could take the logo type and create advertising out of it. Like this Donna Toney poster, or Chopin, or Mozart, or La Monte Young. You can take the shape and make typography out of it. You can grow it underneath the skin. You can have a poster for a family event in front of the house, or a rave underneath the house or a weekly program, as well as educational services.Second insight. So far, until that point I had been mostly involved or used the language of design for promotional purposes, which was fine with me. On one hand I have nothing against selling. My parents are both salespeople. But I did feel that I spent so much time learning this language, why do I only promote with it? There must be something else. And the whole series of work came out of it. Some of you might have seen it. I showed some of it at earlier TEDs before, under the title \"Things I've Learned in My Life So Far.\" I'll just show two now.This is a whole wall of bananas at different ripenesses on the opening day in this gallery in New York. It says, \"Self-confidence produces fine results.\" This is after a week. After two weeks, three weeks, four weeks, five weeks. And you see the self confidence almost comes back, but not quite. These are some pictures visitors sent to me. (Laughter)And then the city of Amsterdam gave us a plaza and asked us to do something. We used the stone plates as a grid for our little piece. We got 250,000 coins from the central bank, at different darknesses. So we got brand new ones, shiny ones, medium ones, and very old, dark ones. And with the help of 100 volunteers, over a week, created this fairly floral typography that spelled, \"Obsessions make my life worse and my work better.\"And the idea of course was to make the type so precious that as an audience you would be in between, \"Should I really take as much money as I can? Or should I leave the piece intact as it is right now?\" While we built all this up during that week, with the 100 volunteers, a good number of the neighbors surrounding the plaza got very close to it and quite loved it. So when it was finally done, and in the first night a guy came with big plastic bags and scooped up as many coins as he could possibly carry, one of the neighbors called the police.And the Amsterdam police in all their wisdom, came, saw, and they wanted to protect the artwork. And they swept it all up and put it into custody at police headquarters. (Laughter) I think you see, you see them sweeping. You see them sweeping right here. That's the police, getting rid of it all. So after eight hours that's pretty much all that was left of the whole thing. (Laughter)We are also working on the start of a bigger project in Bali. It's a movie about happiness. And here we asked some nearby pigs to do the titles for us. They weren't quite slick enough. So we asked the goose to do it again, and hoped she would do somehow, a more elegant or pretty job. And I think she overdid it. Just a bit too ornamental. And my studio is very close to the monkey forest. And the monkeys in that monkey forest looked, actually, fairly happy. So we asked those guys to do it again. They did a fine job, but had a couple of readability problems. So of course whatever you don't really do yourself doesn't really get done properly.That film we'll be working on for the next two years. So it's going to be a while. And of course you might think that doing a film on happiness might not really be worthwhile. Then you can of course always go and see this guy.Video: (Laughter) And I'm happy I'm alive. I'm happy I'm alive. I'm happy I'm alive.Stefan Sagmeister: Thank you.

I do it for money.\n\n00:02:35.958 --> 00:02:39.958\nI likely already look forward to the weekend on Thursdays.\n\n00:02:39.958 --> 00:02:44.958\nAnd I probably will need a hobby as a leveling mechanism.\n\n00:02:44.958 --> 00:02:47.958\nIn a career I'm definitely more engaged.\n\n00:02:47.958 --> 00:02:49.958\nBut at the same time, there will be periods when I think\n\n00:02:49.958 --> 00:02:54.958\nis all that really hard work really worth my while?\n\n00:02:54.958 --> 00:02:56.958\nWhile in the third one, in the calling,\n\n00:02:56.958 --> 00:02:59.958\nvery much likely I would do it also\n\n00:02:59.958 --> 00:03:03.958\nif I wouldn't be financially compensated for it.\n\n00:03:03.958 --> 00:03:05.958\nI am not a religious person myself,\n\n00:03:05.958 --> 00:03:08.958\nbut I did look for nature.\n\n00:03:08.958 --> 00:03:12.958\nI had spent my first sabbatical in New York City.\n\n00:03:12.958 --> 00:03:15.958\nLooked for something different for the second one.\n\n00:03:15.958 --> 00:03:18.958\nEurope and the U.S. didn't really feel enticing\n\n00:03:18.958 --> 00:03:21.958\nbecause I knew them too well. So Asia it was.\n\n00:03:21.958 --> 00:03:23.958\nThe most beautiful landscapes I had seen in Asia\n\n00:03:23.958 --> 00:03:25.958\nwere Sri Lanka and Bali.\n\n00:03:25.958 --> 00:03:29.958\nSri Lanka still had the civil war going on, so Bali it was.\n\n00:03:29.958 --> 00:03:33.958\nIt's a wonderful, very craft-oriented society.\n\n00:03:33.958 --> 00:03:37.958\nI arrived there in September 2008,\n\n00:03:37.958 --> 00:03:40.958\nand pretty much started to work right away.\n\n00:03:40.958 --> 00:03:46.958\nThere is wonderful inspiration coming from the area itself.\n\n00:03:46.958 --> 00:03:49.958\nHowever the first thing that I needed was\n\n00:03:49.958 --> 00:03:52.958\nmosquito repellent typography\n\n00:03:52.958 --> 00:03:55.958\nbecause they were definitely around heavily.\n\n00:03:55.958 --> 00:03:58.958\nAnd then I needed some sort of way\n\n00:03:58.958 --> 00:04:01.958\nto be able to get back to all the wild dogs\n\n00:04:01.958 --> 00:04:03.958\nthat surround my house,\n\n00:04:03.958 --> 00:04:06.958\nand attacked me during my morning walks.\n\n00:04:06.958 --> 00:04:12.958\nSo we created this series of 99 portraits on tee shirts.\n\n00:04:12.958 --> 00:04:16.958\nEvery single dog on one tee shirt.\n\n00:04:16.958 --> 00:04:18.958\nAs a little retaliation\n\n00:04:18.958 --> 00:04:22.958\nwith a just ever so slightly menacing message\n\n00:04:22.958 --> 00:04:23.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:04:23.958 --> 00:04:25.958\non the back of the shirt.\n\n00:04:25.958 --> 00:04:27.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:04:27.958 --> 00:04:29.958\nJust before I left New York\n\n00:04:29.958 --> 00:04:33.958\nI decided I could actually renovate my studio.\n\n00:04:33.958 --> 00:04:36.958\nAnd then just leave it all to them.\n\n00:04:36.958 --> 00:04:38.958\nAnd I don't have to do anything.\n\n00:04:38.958 --> 00:04:40.958\nSo I looked for furniture.\n\n00:04:40.958 --> 00:04:42.958\nAnd it turned out that\n\n00:04:42.958 --> 00:04:44.958\nall the furniture that I really liked,\n\n00:04:44.958 --> 00:04:46.958\nI couldn't afford.\n\n00:04:46.958 --> 00:04:48.958\nAnd all the stuff I could afford, I didn't like.\n\n00:04:48.958 --> 00:04:50.958\nSo one of the things that we pursued in Bali\n\n00:04:50.958 --> 00:04:53.958\nwas pieces of furniture.\n\n00:04:53.958 --> 00:04:56.958\nThis one, of course, still works with the wild dogs.\n\n00:04:56.958 --> 00:04:59.958\nIt's not quite finished yet.\n\n00:04:59.958 --> 00:05:02.958\nAnd I think by the time this lamp came about,\n\n00:05:02.958 --> 00:05:04.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:05:04.958 --> 00:05:08.958\nI had finally made peace with those dogs.\n\n00:05:08.958 --> 00:05:13.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:05:13.958 --> 00:05:16.958\nThen there is a coffee table. I also did a coffee table.\n\n00:05:16.958 --> 00:05:18.958\nIt's called Be Here Now.\n\n00:05:18.958 --> 00:05:22.958\nIt includes 330 compasses.\n\n00:05:22.958 --> 00:05:25.958\nAnd we had custom espresso cups made\n\n00:05:25.958 --> 00:05:27.958\nthat hide a magnet inside,\n\n00:05:27.958 --> 00:05:30.958\nand make those compasses go crazy,\n\n00:05:30.958 --> 00:05:33.958\nalways centering on them.\n\n00:05:33.958 --> 00:05:41.958\nThen this is a fairly talkative, verbose kind of chair.\n\n00:05:41.958 --> 00:05:45.958\nI also started meditating for the first time in my life in Bali.\n\n00:05:45.958 --> 00:05:47.958\nAnd at the same time, I'm extremely aware\n\n00:05:47.958 --> 00:05:51.958\nhow boring it is to hear about other people's happinesses.\n\n00:05:51.958 --> 00:05:56.958\nSo I will not really go too far into it.\n\n00:05:56.958 --> 00:05:59.958\nMany of you will know this TEDster,\n\n00:05:59.958 --> 00:06:01.958\nDanny Gilbert, whose book, actually,\n\n00:06:01.958 --> 00:06:03.958\nI got it through the TED book club.\n\n00:06:03.958 --> 00:06:05.958\nI think it took me four years\n\n00:06:05.958 --> 00:06:09.958\nto finally read it, while on sabbatical.\n\n00:06:09.958 --> 00:06:11.958\nAnd I was pleased to see\n\n00:06:11.958 --> 00:06:15.958\nthat he actually wrote the book while he was on sabbatical.\n\n00:06:15.958 --> 00:06:17.958\nAnd I'll show you a couple of people\n\n00:06:17.958 --> 00:06:21.958\nthat did well by pursuing sabbaticals.\n\n00:06:21.958 --> 00:06:23.958\nThis is Ferran Adria. Many people think\n\n00:06:23.958 --> 00:06:26.958\nhe is right now the best chef in the world\n\n00:06:26.958 --> 00:06:29.958\nwith his restaurant north of Barcelona, El Bulli.\n\n00:06:29.958 --> 00:06:31.958\nHis restaurant is open seven months every year.\n\n00:06:31.958 --> 00:06:33.958\nHe closes it down for five months\n\n00:06:33.958 --> 00:06:36.958\nto experiment with a full kitchen staff.\n\n00:06:36.958 --> 00:06:38.958\nHis latest numbers are fairly impressive.\n\n00:06:38.958 --> 00:06:42.958\nHe can seat, throughout the year,\n\n00:06:42.958 --> 00:06:45.958\nhe can seat 8,000 people.\n\n00:06:45.958 --> 00:06:50.958\nAnd he has 2.2 million requests for reservations.\n\n00:06:50.958 --> 00:06:53.958\nIf I look at my cycle, seven years, one year sabbatical,\n\n00:06:53.958 --> 00:06:56.958\nit's 12.5 percent of my time.\n\n00:06:56.958 --> 00:07:01.958\nAnd if I look at companies that are actually more successful than mine,\n\n00:07:01.958 --> 00:07:04.958\n3M since the 1930s\n\n00:07:04.958 --> 00:07:06.958\nis giving all their engineers\n\n00:07:06.958 --> 00:07:10.958\n15 percent to pursue whatever they want.\n\n00:07:10.958 --> 00:07:12.958\nThere is some good successes.\n\n00:07:12.958 --> 00:07:15.958\nScotch tape came out of this program,\n\n00:07:15.958 --> 00:07:19.958\nas well as Art Fry developed\n\n00:07:19.958 --> 00:07:23.958\nsticky notes from during his personal time for 3M.\n\n00:07:23.958 --> 00:07:25.958\nGoogle, of course, very famously\n\n00:07:25.958 --> 00:07:27.958\ngives 20 percent for their software engineers\n\n00:07:27.958 --> 00:07:31.958\nto pursue their own personal projects.\n\n00:07:31.958 --> 00:07:37.958\nAnybody in here has actually ever conducted a sabbatical?\n\n00:07:37.958 --> 00:07:43.958\nThat's about five percent of everybody.\n\n00:07:43.958 --> 00:07:47.958\nSo I'm not sure if you saw your neighbor putting their hand up.\n\n00:07:47.958 --> 00:07:51.958\nTalk to them about if it was successful or not.\n\n00:07:51.958 --> 00:07:53.958\nI've found that\n\n00:07:53.958 --> 00:07:57.958\nfinding out about what I'm going to like in the future,\n\n00:07:57.958 --> 00:07:59.958\nmy very best way is to talk to people\n\n00:07:59.958 --> 00:08:01.958\nwho have actually done it\n\n00:08:01.958 --> 00:08:05.958\nmuch better than myself envisioning it.\n\n00:08:05.958 --> 00:08:07.958\nWhen I had the idea of doing one,\n\n00:08:07.958 --> 00:08:13.958\nthe process was I made the decision and I put it into my daily planner book.\n\n00:08:13.958 --> 00:08:17.958\nAnd then I told as many, many people as I possibly could about it\n\n00:08:17.958 --> 00:08:20.958\nso that there was no way that I could chicken out later on.\n\n00:08:20.958 --> 00:08:22.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:08:22.958 --> 00:08:25.958\nIn the beginning, on the first sabbatical,\n\n00:08:25.958 --> 00:08:29.958\nit was rather disastrous.\n\n00:08:29.958 --> 00:08:33.958\nI had thought that I should do this without any plan,\n\n00:08:33.958 --> 00:08:37.958\nthat this vacuum of time somehow would\n\n00:08:37.958 --> 00:08:39.958\nbe wonderful and enticing\n\n00:08:39.958 --> 00:08:42.958\nfor idea generation. It was not.\n\n00:08:42.958 --> 00:08:46.958\nI just, without a plan, I just reacted\n\n00:08:46.958 --> 00:08:49.958\nto little requests, not work requests,\n\n00:08:49.958 --> 00:08:52.958\nthose I all said no to, but other little requests.\n\n00:08:52.958 --> 00:08:55.958\nSending mail to Japanese design magazines and things like that.\n\n00:08:55.958 --> 00:08:57.958\nSo I became my own intern.\n\n00:08:57.958 --> 00:09:00.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:09:00.958 --> 00:09:02.958\nAnd I very quickly\n\n00:09:02.958 --> 00:09:06.958\nmade a list of the things I was interested in,\n\n00:09:06.958 --> 00:09:10.958\nput them in a hierarchy, divided them into chunks of time\n\n00:09:10.958 --> 00:09:14.958\nand then made a plan, very much like in grade school.\n\n00:09:14.958 --> 00:09:18.958\nWhat does it say here? Monday, 8 to 9: story writing;\n\n00:09:18.958 --> 00:09:20.958\n9 to 10: future thinking.\n\n00:09:20.958 --> 00:09:23.958\nWas not very successful. And so on and so forth.\n\n00:09:23.958 --> 00:09:25.958\nAnd that actually, specifically as a starting point\n\n00:09:25.958 --> 00:09:28.958\nof the first sabbatical, worked really well for me.\n\n00:09:28.958 --> 00:09:30.958\nWhat came out of it?\n\n00:09:30.958 --> 00:09:32.958\nI really got close to design again.\n\n00:09:32.958 --> 00:09:34.958\nI had fun.\n\n00:09:34.958 --> 00:09:37.958\nFinancially, seen over the long term, it was actually successful.\n\n00:09:37.958 --> 00:09:42.958\nBecause of the improved quality, we could ask for higher prices.\n\n00:09:42.958 --> 00:09:44.958\nAnd probably most importantly,\n\n00:09:44.958 --> 00:09:46.958\nbasically everything we've done\n\n00:09:46.958 --> 00:09:48.958\nin the seven years following the first sabbatical\n\n00:09:48.958 --> 00:09:52.958\ncame out of thinking of that one single year.\n\n00:09:52.958 --> 00:09:55.958\nAnd I'll show you a couple of projects\n\n00:09:55.958 --> 00:10:00.958\nthat came out of the seven years following that sabbatical.\n\n00:10:00.958 --> 00:10:04.958\nOne of the strands of thinking I was involved in was\n\n00:10:04.958 --> 00:10:06.958\nthat sameness is so incredibly overrated.\n\n00:10:06.958 --> 00:10:10.958\nThis whole idea that everything needs to be exactly the same\n\n00:10:10.958 --> 00:10:13.958\nworks for a very very few strand of companies,\n\n00:10:13.958 --> 00:10:15.958\nand not for everybody else.\n\n00:10:15.958 --> 00:10:19.958\nWe were asked to design an identity for Casa da Musica,\n\n00:10:19.958 --> 00:10:22.958\nthe Rem Koolhaas-built music center\n\n00:10:22.958 --> 00:10:24.958\nin Porto, in Portugal.\n\n00:10:24.958 --> 00:10:28.958\nAnd even though I desired to do an identity\n\n00:10:28.958 --> 00:10:32.958\nthat doesn't use the architecture,\n\n00:10:32.958 --> 00:10:34.958\nI failed at that.\n\n00:10:34.958 --> 00:10:37.958\nAnd mostly also because I realized\n\n00:10:37.958 --> 00:10:40.958\nout of a Rem Koolhaas presentation to the city of Porto, where\n\n00:10:40.958 --> 00:10:44.958\nhe talked about a conglomeration of various layers of meaning.\n\n00:10:44.958 --> 00:10:46.958\nWhich I understood after I\n\n00:10:46.958 --> 00:10:48.958\ntranslated it from architecture speech\n\n00:10:48.958 --> 00:10:50.958\nin to regular English,\n\n00:10:50.958 --> 00:10:52.958\nbasically as logo making.\n\n00:10:52.958 --> 00:10:55.958\nAnd I understood that the building itself was a logo.\n\n00:10:55.958 --> 00:10:57.958\nSo then it became quite easy.\n\n00:10:57.958 --> 00:10:59.958\nWe put a mask on it,\n\n00:10:59.958 --> 00:11:01.958\nlooked at it deep down in the ground,\n\n00:11:01.958 --> 00:11:04.958\nchecked it out from all sides,\n\n00:11:04.958 --> 00:11:07.958\nwest, north, south, east,\n\n00:11:07.958 --> 00:11:09.958\ntop and bottom.\n\n00:11:09.958 --> 00:11:11.958\nColored them in a very particular way\n\n00:11:11.958 --> 00:11:14.958\nby having a friend of mine write a piece of software,\n\n00:11:14.958 --> 00:11:16.958\nthe Casa da Musica Logo Generator.\n\n00:11:16.958 --> 00:11:19.958\nThat's connected to a scanner.\n\n00:11:19.958 --> 00:11:22.958\nYou put any image in there, like that Beethoven image.\n\n00:11:22.958 --> 00:11:25.958\nAnd the software, in a second,\n\n00:11:25.958 --> 00:11:28.958\nwill give you the Casa da Musica Beethoven logo.\n\n00:11:28.958 --> 00:11:31.958\nWhich, when you actually have to design a Beethoven poster,\n\n00:11:31.958 --> 00:11:36.958\ncomes in handy, because the visual information of the logo\n\n00:11:36.958 --> 00:11:39.958\nand the actual poster is exactly the same.\n\n00:11:39.958 --> 00:11:43.958\nSo it will always fit together, conceptually, of course.\n\n00:11:43.958 --> 00:11:47.958\nIf Zappa's music is performed, it gets its own logo.\n\n00:11:47.958 --> 00:11:50.958\nOr Philip Glass or Lou Reed or the Chemical Brothers,\n\n00:11:50.958 --> 00:11:52.958\nwho all performed there, get their own\n\n00:11:52.958 --> 00:11:54.958\nCasa da Musica logo.\n\n00:11:54.958 --> 00:11:58.958\nIt works the same internally with the president or the musical director,\n\n00:11:58.958 --> 00:12:02.958\nwhose Casa da Musica portraits wind up on their business cards.\n\n00:12:02.958 --> 00:12:04.958\nThere is a full-blown orchestra\n\n00:12:04.958 --> 00:12:07.958\nliving inside the building.\n\n00:12:07.958 --> 00:12:11.958\nIt has a more transparent identity.\n\n00:12:11.958 --> 00:12:14.958\nThe truck they go on tour with.\n\n00:12:14.958 --> 00:12:17.958\nOr there's a smaller contemporary orchestra,\n\n00:12:17.958 --> 00:12:23.958\n12 people that remixes its own title.\n\n00:12:23.958 --> 00:12:25.958\nAnd one of the handy things that came about\n\n00:12:25.958 --> 00:12:28.958\nwas that you could take the logo type\n\n00:12:28.958 --> 00:12:31.958\nand create advertising out of it.\n\n00:12:31.958 --> 00:12:33.958\nLike this Donna Toney poster,\n\n00:12:33.958 --> 00:12:35.958\nor Chopin, or Mozart,\n\n00:12:35.958 --> 00:12:37.958\nor La Monte Young.\n\n00:12:37.958 --> 00:12:41.958\nYou can take the shape and make typography out of it.\n\n00:12:41.958 --> 00:12:43.958\nYou can grow it underneath the skin.\n\n00:12:43.958 --> 00:12:47.958\nYou can have a poster for a family event in front of the house,\n\n00:12:47.958 --> 00:12:50.958\nor a rave underneath the house\n\n00:12:50.958 --> 00:12:52.958\nor a weekly program,\n\n00:12:52.958 --> 00:12:56.958\nas well as educational services.\n\n00:12:56.958 --> 00:12:59.958\nSecond insight. So far, until that point I had\n\n00:12:59.958 --> 00:13:02.958\nbeen mostly involved\n\n00:13:02.958 --> 00:13:04.958\nor used the language of design\n\n00:13:04.958 --> 00:13:06.958\nfor promotional purposes,\n\n00:13:06.958 --> 00:13:08.958\nwhich was fine with me.\n\n00:13:08.958 --> 00:13:10.958\nOn one hand I have nothing against selling.\n\n00:13:10.958 --> 00:13:13.958\nMy parents are both salespeople.\n\n00:13:13.958 --> 00:13:15.958\nBut I did feel that\n\n00:13:15.958 --> 00:13:17.958\nI spent so much time learning this language,\n\n00:13:17.958 --> 00:13:20.958\nwhy do I only promote with it?\n\n00:13:20.958 --> 00:13:22.958\nThere must be something else.\n\n00:13:22.958 --> 00:13:24.958\nAnd the whole series of work came out of it.\n\n00:13:24.958 --> 00:13:26.958\nSome of you might have seen it.\n\n00:13:26.958 --> 00:13:28.958\nI showed some of it\n\n00:13:28.958 --> 00:13:30.958\nat earlier TEDs before,\n\n00:13:30.958 --> 00:13:33.958\nunder the title \"Things I've Learned in My Life So Far.\"\n\n00:13:33.958 --> 00:13:35.958\nI'll just show two now.\n\n00:13:35.958 --> 00:13:38.958\nThis is a whole wall of bananas\n\n00:13:38.958 --> 00:13:40.958\nat different ripenesses\n\n00:13:40.958 --> 00:13:43.958\non the opening day in this gallery in New York.\n\n00:13:43.958 --> 00:13:47.958\nIt says, \"Self-confidence produces fine results.\"\n\n00:13:47.958 --> 00:13:49.958\nThis is after a week.\n\n00:13:49.958 --> 00:13:51.958\nAfter two weeks,\n\n00:13:51.958 --> 00:13:54.958\nthree weeks, four weeks, five weeks.\n\n00:13:54.958 --> 00:13:56.958\nAnd you see the self confidence almost comes back,\n\n00:13:56.958 --> 00:14:00.958\nbut not quite.\n\n00:14:00.958 --> 00:14:03.958\nThese are some pictures visitors sent to me.\n\n00:14:03.958 --> 00:14:04.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:14:04.958 --> 00:14:06.958\nAnd then the city of Amsterdam\n\n00:14:06.958 --> 00:14:09.958\ngave us a plaza and asked us to do something.\n\n00:14:09.958 --> 00:14:13.958\nWe used the stone plates as a grid\n\n00:14:13.958 --> 00:14:16.958\nfor our little piece.\n\n00:14:16.958 --> 00:14:20.958\nWe got 250,000 coins from the central bank,\n\n00:14:20.958 --> 00:14:22.958\nat different darknesses.\n\n00:14:22.958 --> 00:14:24.958\nSo we got brand new ones, shiny ones,\n\n00:14:24.958 --> 00:14:28.958\nmedium ones, and very old, dark ones.\n\n00:14:28.958 --> 00:14:32.958\nAnd with the help of 100 volunteers, over a week,\n\n00:14:32.958 --> 00:14:37.958\ncreated this fairly floral typography\n\n00:14:37.958 --> 00:14:39.958\nthat spelled, \"Obsessions make my life worse\n\n00:14:39.958 --> 00:14:41.958\nand my work better.\"\n\n00:14:41.958 --> 00:14:43.958\nAnd the idea of course was to\n\n00:14:43.958 --> 00:14:46.958\nmake the type so precious\n\n00:14:46.958 --> 00:14:48.958\nthat as an audience\n\n00:14:48.958 --> 00:14:50.958\nyou would be in between,\n\n00:14:50.958 --> 00:14:52.958\n\"Should I really take as much money as I can?\n\n00:14:52.958 --> 00:14:57.958\nOr should I leave the piece intact as it is right now?\"\n\n00:14:57.958 --> 00:14:59.958\nWhile we built all this up\n\n00:14:59.958 --> 00:15:01.958\nduring that week, with the 100 volunteers,\n\n00:15:01.958 --> 00:15:05.958\na good number of the neighbors surrounding the plaza\n\n00:15:05.958 --> 00:15:07.958\ngot very close to it and quite loved it.\n\n00:15:07.958 --> 00:15:09.958\nSo when it was finally done,\n\n00:15:09.958 --> 00:15:11.958\nand in the first night\n\n00:15:11.958 --> 00:15:13.958\na guy came with big plastic bags\n\n00:15:13.958 --> 00:15:18.958\nand scooped up as many coins as he could possibly carry,\n\n00:15:18.958 --> 00:15:20.958\none of the neighbors called the police.\n\n00:15:20.958 --> 00:15:22.958\nAnd the Amsterdam police\n\n00:15:22.958 --> 00:15:25.958\nin all their wisdom,\n\n00:15:25.958 --> 00:15:27.958\ncame, saw,\n\n00:15:27.958 --> 00:15:29.958\nand they wanted to protect the artwork.\n\n00:15:29.958 --> 00:15:32.958\nAnd they swept it all up and put it into custody\n\n00:15:32.958 --> 00:15:34.958\nat police headquarters.\n\n00:15:34.958 --> 00:15:36.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:15:36.958 --> 00:15:39.958\nI think you see, you see them sweeping.

It's one of the great questions of our time. Yet it's one that's rarely asked. We take it for granted that if we go into a shop or restaurant, or indeed into this theater's foyer in about an hour's time, there is going to be food there waiting for us, having magically come from somewhere.But when you think that every day for a city the size of London, enough food has to be produced, transported, bought and sold, cooked, eaten, disposed of, and that something similar has to happen every day for every city on earth, it's remarkable that cities get fed at all.We live in places like this as if they're the most natural things in the world, forgetting that because we're animals and that we need to eat, we're actually as dependent on the natural world as our ancient ancestors were. And as more of us move into cities, more of that natural world is being transformed into extraordinary landscapes like the one behind me \u2014 it's soybean fields in Mato Grosso in Brazil \u2014 in order to feed us. These are extraordinary landscapes, but few of us ever get to see them.And increasingly these landscapes are not just feeding us either. As more of us move into cities, more of us are eating meat, so that a third of the annual grain crop globally now gets fed to animals rather than to us human animals. And given that it takes three times as much grain \u2014 actually ten times as much grain \u2014 to feed a human if it's passed through an animal first, that's not a very efficient way of feeding us.And it's an escalating problem too. By 2050, it's estimated that twice the number of us are going to be living in cities. And it's also estimated that there is going to be twice as much meat and dairy consumed. So meat and urbanism are rising hand in hand. And that's going to pose an enormous problem. Six billion hungry carnivores to feed, by 2050. That's a big problem. And actually if we carry on as we are, it's a problem we're very unlikely to be able to solve.Nineteen million hectares of rainforest are lost every year to create new arable land. Although at the same time we're losing an equivalent amount of existing arables to salinization and erosion. We're very hungry for fossil fuels too. It takes about 10 calories to produce every calorie of food that we consume in the West. And even though there is food that we are producing at great cost, we don't actually value it. Half the food produced in the USA is currently thrown away. And to end all of this, at the end of this long process, we're not even managing to feed the planet properly. A billion of us are obese, while a further billion starve. None of it makes very much sense.And when you think that 80 percent of global trade in food now is controlled by just five multinational corporations, it's a grim picture. As we're moving into cities, the world is also embracing a Western diet. And if we look to the future, it's an unsustainable diet.So how did we get here? And more importantly, what are we going to do about it? Well, to answer the slightly easier question first, about 10,000 years ago, I would say, is the beginning of this process in the ancient Near East, known as the Fertile Crescent. Because, as you can see, it was crescent shaped. And it was also fertile. And it was here, about 10,000 years ago, that two extraordinary inventions, agriculture and urbanism, happened roughly in the same place and at the same time.This is no accident, because agriculture and cities are bound together. They need each other. Because it was discovery of grain by our ancient ancestors for the first time that produced a food source that was large enough and stable enough to support permanent settlements. And if we look at what those settlements were like, we see they were compact. They were surrounded by productive farm land and dominated by large temple complexes like this one at Ur, that were, in fact, effectively, spiritualized, central food distribution centers.Because it was the temples that organized the harvest, gathered in the grain, offered it to the gods, and then offered the grain that the gods didn't eat back to the people. So, if you like, the whole spiritual and physical life of these cities was dominated by the grain and the harvest that sustained them. And in fact, that's true of every ancient city. But of course not all of them were that small. Famously, Rome had about a million citizens by the first century A.D. So how did a city like this feed itself? The answer is what I call \"ancient food miles.\"Basically, Rome had access to the sea, which made it possible for it to import food from a very long way away. This is the only way it was possible to do this in the ancient world, because it was very difficult to transport food over roads, which were rough. And the food obviously went off very quickly. So Rome effectively waged war on places like Carthage and Egypt just to get its paws on their grain reserves. And, in fact, you could say that the expansion of the Empire was really sort of one long, drawn out militarized shopping spree, really. (Laughter) In fact \u2014 I love the fact, I just have to mention this: Rome in fact used to import oysters from London, at one stage. I think that's extraordinary.So Rome shaped its hinterland through its appetite. But the interesting thing is that the other thing also happened in the pre-industrial world. If we look at a map of London in the 17th century, we can see that its grain, which is coming in from the Thames, along the bottom of this map. So the grain markets were to the south of the city. And the roads leading up from them to Cheapside, which was the main market, were also grain markets.And if you look at the name of one of those streets, Bread Street, you can tell what was going on there 300 years ago. And the same of course was true for fish. Fish was, of course, coming in by river as well. Same thing. And of course Billingsgate, famously, was London's fish market, operating on-site here until the mid-1980s. Which is extraordinary, really, when you think about it. Everybody else was wandering around with mobile phones that looked like bricks and sort of smelly fish happening down on the port.This is another thing about food in cities: Once its roots into the city are established, they very rarely move. Meat is a very different story because, of course, animals could walk into the city. So much of London's meat was coming from the northwest, from Scotland and Wales. So it was coming in, and arriving at the city at the northwest, which is why Smithfield, London's very famous meat market, was located up there. Poultry was coming in from East Anglia and so on, to the northeast. I feel a bit like a weather woman doing this. Anyway, and so the birds were coming in with their feet protected with little canvas shoes. And then when they hit the eastern end of Cheapside, that's where they were sold, which is why it's called Poultry.And, in fact, if you look at the map of any city built before the industrial age, you can trace food coming in to it. You can actually see how it was physically shaped by food, both by reading the names of the streets, which give you a lot of clues. Friday Street, in a previous life, is where you went to buy your fish on a Friday. But also you have to imagine it full of food. Because the streets and the public spaces were the only places where food was bought and sold.And if we look at an image of Smithfield in 1830 you can see that it would have been very difficult to live in a city like this and be unaware of where your food came from. In fact, if you were having Sunday lunch, the chances were it was mooing or bleating outside your window about three days earlier. So this was obviously an organic city, part of an organic cycle. And then 10 years later everything changed.This is an image of the Great Western in 1840. And as you can see, some of the earliest train passengers were pigs and sheep. So all of a sudden, these animals are no longer walking into market. They're being slaughtered out of sight and mind, somewhere in the countryside. And they're coming into the city by rail. And this changes everything. To start off with, it makes it possible for the first time to grow cities, really any size and shape, in any place. Cities used to be constrained by geography; they used to have to get their food through very difficult physical means. All of a sudden they are effectively emancipated from geography.And as you can see from these maps of London, in the 90 years after the trains came, it goes from being a little blob that was quite easy to feed by animals coming in on foot, and so on, to a large splurge, that would be very, very difficult to feed with anybody on foot, either animals or people. And of course that was just the beginning. After the trains came cars, and really this marks the end of this process. It's the final emancipation of the city from any apparent relationship with nature at all.And this is the kind of city that's devoid of smell, devoid of mess, certainly devoid of people, because nobody would have dreamed of walking in such a landscape. In fact, what they did to get food was they got in their cars, drove to a box somewhere on the outskirts, came back with a week's worth of shopping, and wondered what on earth to do with it. And this really is the moment when our relationship, both with food and cities, changes completely.Here we have food \u2014 that used to be the center, the social core of the city \u2014 at the periphery. It used to be a social event, buying and selling food. Now it's anonymous. We used to cook; now we just add water, or a little bit of an egg if you're making a cake or something. We don't smell food to see if it's okay to eat. We just read the back of a label on a packet. And we don't value food. We don't trust it. So instead of trusting it, we fear it. And instead of valuing it, we throw it away.One of the great ironies of modern food systems is that they've made the very thing they promised to make easier much harder. By making it possible to build cities anywhere and any place, they've actually distanced us from our most important relationship, which is that of us and nature. And also they've made us dependent on systems that only they can deliver, that, as we've seen, are unsustainable.So what are we going to do about that? It's not a new question. 500 years ago it's what Thomas More was asking himself. This is the frontispiece of his book \"Utopia.\" And it was a series of semi-independent city-states, if that sounds remotely familiar, a day's walk from one another where everyone was basically farming-mad, and grew vegetables in their back gardens, and ate communal meals together, and so on. And I think you could argue that food is a fundamental ordering principle of Utopia, even though More never framed it that way.And here is another very famous \"Utopian\" vision, that of Ebenezer Howard, \"The Garden City.\" Same idea: series of semi-independent city-states, little blobs of metropolitan stuff with arable land around, joined to one another by railway. And again, food could be said to be the ordering principle of his vision. It even got built, but nothing to do with this vision that Howard had. And that is the problem with these Utopian ideas, that they are Utopian.Utopia was actually a word that Thomas Moore used deliberately. It was a kind of joke, because it's got a double derivation from the Greek. It can either mean a good place, or no place. Because it's an ideal. It's an imaginary thing. We can't have it. And I think, as a conceptual tool for thinking about the very deep problem of human dwelling, that makes it not much use. So I've come up with an alternative, which is Sitopia, from the ancient Greek, \"sitos\" for food, and \"topos\" for place.I believe we already live in Sitopia. We live in a world shaped by food, and if we realize that, we can use food as a really powerful tool \u2014 a conceptual tool, design tool, to shape the world differently. So if we were to do that, what might Sitopia look like? Well I think it looks a bit like this. I have to use this slide. It's just the look on the face of the dog. But anyway, this is \u2014 (Laughter) it's food at the center of life, at the center of family life, being celebrated, being enjoyed, people taking time for it. This is where food should be in our society.But you can't have scenes like this unless you have people like this. By the way, these can be men as well. It's people who think about food, who think ahead, who plan, who can stare at a pile of raw vegetables and actually recognize them. We need these people. We're part of a network. Because without these kinds of people we can't have places like this. Here, I deliberately chose this because it is a man buying a vegetable. But networks, markets where food is being grown locally. It's common. It's fresh. It's part of the social life of the city. Because without that, you can't have this kind of place, food that is grown locally and also is part of the landscape, and is not just a zero-sum commodity off in some unseen hell-hole. Cows with a view. Steaming piles of humus. This is basically bringing the whole thing together.And this is a community project I visited recently in Toronto. It's a greenhouse, where kids get told all about food and growing their own food. Here is a plant called Kevin, or maybe it's a plant belonging to a kid called Kevin. I don't know. But anyway, these kinds of projects that are trying to reconnect us with nature is extremely important.So Sitopia, for me, is really a way of seeing. It's basically recognizing that Sitopia already exists in little pockets everywhere. The trick is to join them up, to use food as a way of seeing. And if we do that, we're going to stop seeing cities as big, metropolitan, unproductive blobs, like this. We're going to see them more like this, as part of the productive, organic framework of which they are inevitably a part, symbiotically connected. But of course, that's not a great image either, because we need not to be producing food like this anymore. We need to be thinking more about permaculture, which is why I think this image just sums up for me the kind of thinking we need to be doing. It's a re-conceptualization of the way food shapes our lives.The best image I know of this is from 650 years ago. It's Ambrogio Lorenzetti's \"Allegory of Good Government.\" It's about the relationship between the city and the countryside. And I think the message of this is very clear. If the city looks after the country, the country will look after the city. And I want us to ask now, what would Ambrogio Lorenzetti paint if he painted this image today? What would an allegory of good government look like today? Because I think it's an urgent question. It's one we have to ask, and we have to start answering. We know we are what we eat. We need to realize that the world is also what we eat. But if we take that idea, we can use food as a really powerful tool to shape the world better. Thank you very much.

And actually if we carry on as we are,\n\n00:02:22.958 --> 00:02:25.958\nit's a problem we're very unlikely to be able to solve.\n\n00:02:25.958 --> 00:02:29.958\nNineteen million hectares of rainforest are lost every year\n\n00:02:29.958 --> 00:02:31.958\nto create new arable land.\n\n00:02:31.958 --> 00:02:34.958\nAlthough at the same time we're losing an equivalent amount\n\n00:02:34.958 --> 00:02:38.958\nof existing arables to salinization and erosion.\n\n00:02:38.958 --> 00:02:41.958\nWe're very hungry for fossil fuels too.\n\n00:02:41.958 --> 00:02:44.958\nIt takes about 10 calories to produce every calorie\n\n00:02:44.958 --> 00:02:48.958\nof food that we consume in the West.\n\n00:02:48.958 --> 00:02:52.958\nAnd even though there is food that we are producing at great cost,\n\n00:02:52.958 --> 00:02:54.958\nwe don't actually value it.\n\n00:02:54.958 --> 00:02:58.958\nHalf the food produced in the USA is currently thrown away.\n\n00:02:58.958 --> 00:03:01.958\nAnd to end all of this, at the end of this long process,\n\n00:03:01.958 --> 00:03:04.958\nwe're not even managing to feed the planet properly.\n\n00:03:04.958 --> 00:03:09.958\nA billion of us are obese, while a further billion starve.\n\n00:03:09.958 --> 00:03:11.958\nNone of it makes very much sense.\n\n00:03:11.958 --> 00:03:14.958\nAnd when you think that 80 percent of global trade in food now\n\n00:03:14.958 --> 00:03:19.958\nis controlled by just five multinational corporations,\n\n00:03:19.958 --> 00:03:21.958\nit's a grim picture.\n\n00:03:21.958 --> 00:03:24.958\nAs we're moving into cities, the world is also embracing a Western diet.\n\n00:03:24.958 --> 00:03:27.958\nAnd if we look to the future,\n\n00:03:27.958 --> 00:03:29.958\nit's an unsustainable diet.\n\n00:03:29.958 --> 00:03:31.958\nSo how did we get here?\n\n00:03:31.958 --> 00:03:34.958\nAnd more importantly, what are we going to do about it?\n\n00:03:34.958 --> 00:03:38.958\nWell, to answer the slightly easier question first,\n\n00:03:38.958 --> 00:03:40.958\nabout 10,000 years ago, I would say,\n\n00:03:40.958 --> 00:03:42.958\nis the beginning of this process\n\n00:03:42.958 --> 00:03:44.958\nin the ancient Near East,\n\n00:03:44.958 --> 00:03:46.958\nknown as the Fertile Crescent.\n\n00:03:46.958 --> 00:03:48.958\nBecause, as you can see, it was crescent shaped.\n\n00:03:48.958 --> 00:03:50.958\nAnd it was also fertile.\n\n00:03:50.958 --> 00:03:53.958\nAnd it was here, about 10,000 years ago,\n\n00:03:53.958 --> 00:03:55.958\nthat two extraordinary inventions,\n\n00:03:55.958 --> 00:03:58.958\nagriculture and urbanism, happened\n\n00:03:58.958 --> 00:04:01.958\nroughly in the same place and at the same time.\n\n00:04:01.958 --> 00:04:03.958\nThis is no accident,\n\n00:04:03.958 --> 00:04:07.958\nbecause agriculture and cities are bound together. They need each other.\n\n00:04:07.958 --> 00:04:09.958\nBecause it was discovery of grain\n\n00:04:09.958 --> 00:04:12.958\nby our ancient ancestors for the first time\n\n00:04:12.958 --> 00:04:15.958\nthat produced a food source that was large enough\n\n00:04:15.958 --> 00:04:19.958\nand stable enough to support permanent settlements.\n\n00:04:19.958 --> 00:04:21.958\nAnd if we look at what those settlements were like,\n\n00:04:21.958 --> 00:04:23.958\nwe see they were compact.\n\n00:04:23.958 --> 00:04:25.958\nThey were surrounded by productive farm land\n\n00:04:25.958 --> 00:04:28.958\nand dominated by large temple complexes\n\n00:04:28.958 --> 00:04:30.958\nlike this one at Ur,\n\n00:04:30.958 --> 00:04:32.958\nthat were, in fact, effectively,\n\n00:04:32.958 --> 00:04:35.958\nspiritualized, central food distribution centers.\n\n00:04:35.958 --> 00:04:38.958\nBecause it was the temples that organized the harvest,\n\n00:04:38.958 --> 00:04:40.958\ngathered in the grain, offered it to the gods,\n\n00:04:40.958 --> 00:04:44.958\nand then offered the grain that the gods didn't eat back to the people.\n\n00:04:44.958 --> 00:04:46.958\nSo, if you like,\n\n00:04:46.958 --> 00:04:48.958\nthe whole spiritual and physical life of these cities\n\n00:04:48.958 --> 00:04:51.958\nwas dominated by the grain and the harvest\n\n00:04:51.958 --> 00:04:54.958\nthat sustained them.\n\n00:04:54.958 --> 00:04:57.958\nAnd in fact, that's true of every ancient city.\n\n00:04:57.958 --> 00:04:59.958\nBut of course not all of them were that small.\n\n00:04:59.958 --> 00:05:02.958\nFamously, Rome had about a million citizens\n\n00:05:02.958 --> 00:05:04.958\nby the first century A.D.\n\n00:05:04.958 --> 00:05:08.958\nSo how did a city like this feed itself?\n\n00:05:08.958 --> 00:05:11.958\nThe answer is what I call \"ancient food miles.\"\n\n00:05:11.958 --> 00:05:14.958\nBasically, Rome had access to the sea,\n\n00:05:14.958 --> 00:05:17.958\nwhich made it possible for it to import food from a very long way away.\n\n00:05:17.958 --> 00:05:20.958\nThis is the only way it was possible to do this in the ancient world,\n\n00:05:20.958 --> 00:05:23.958\nbecause it was very difficult to transport food over roads,\n\n00:05:23.958 --> 00:05:25.958\nwhich were rough.\n\n00:05:25.958 --> 00:05:27.958\nAnd the food obviously went off very quickly.\n\n00:05:27.958 --> 00:05:29.958\nSo Rome effectively waged war\n\n00:05:29.958 --> 00:05:32.958\non places like Carthage and Egypt\n\n00:05:32.958 --> 00:05:34.958\njust to get its paws on their grain reserves.\n\n00:05:34.958 --> 00:05:37.958\nAnd, in fact, you could say that the expansion of the Empire\n\n00:05:37.958 --> 00:05:40.958\nwas really sort of one long, drawn out\n\n00:05:40.958 --> 00:05:42.958\nmilitarized shopping spree, really.\n\n00:05:42.958 --> 00:05:44.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:05:44.958 --> 00:05:46.958\nIn fact -- I love the fact, I just have to mention this:\n\n00:05:46.958 --> 00:05:49.958\nRome in fact used to import oysters from London,\n\n00:05:49.958 --> 00:05:51.958\nat one stage. I think that's extraordinary.\n\n00:05:51.958 --> 00:05:54.958\nSo Rome shaped its hinterland\n\n00:05:54.958 --> 00:05:56.958\nthrough its appetite.\n\n00:05:56.958 --> 00:05:58.958\nBut the interesting thing is that the other thing also\n\n00:05:58.958 --> 00:06:00.958\nhappened in the pre-industrial world.\n\n00:06:00.958 --> 00:06:03.958\nIf we look at a map of London in the 17th century,\n\n00:06:03.958 --> 00:06:06.958\nwe can see that its grain, which is coming in from the Thames,\n\n00:06:06.958 --> 00:06:08.958\nalong the bottom of this map.\n\n00:06:08.958 --> 00:06:11.958\nSo the grain markets were to the south of the city.\n\n00:06:11.958 --> 00:06:13.958\nAnd the roads leading up from them\n\n00:06:13.958 --> 00:06:15.958\nto Cheapside, which was the main market,\n\n00:06:15.958 --> 00:06:17.958\nwere also grain markets.\n\n00:06:17.958 --> 00:06:19.958\nAnd if you look at the name of one of those streets,\n\n00:06:19.958 --> 00:06:22.958\nBread Street, you can tell\n\n00:06:22.958 --> 00:06:25.958\nwhat was going on there 300 years ago.\n\n00:06:25.958 --> 00:06:27.958\nAnd the same of course was true for fish.\n\n00:06:27.958 --> 00:06:30.958\nFish was, of course, coming in by river as well. Same thing.\n\n00:06:30.958 --> 00:06:33.958\nAnd of course Billingsgate, famously, was London's fish market,\n\n00:06:33.958 --> 00:06:37.958\noperating on-site here until the mid-1980s.\n\n00:06:37.958 --> 00:06:39.958\nWhich is extraordinary, really, when you think about it.\n\n00:06:39.958 --> 00:06:41.958\nEverybody else was wandering around\n\n00:06:41.958 --> 00:06:43.958\nwith mobile phones that looked like bricks\n\n00:06:43.958 --> 00:06:46.958\nand sort of smelly fish happening down on the port.\n\n00:06:46.958 --> 00:06:49.958\nThis is another thing about food in cities:\n\n00:06:49.958 --> 00:06:52.958\nOnce its roots into the city are established,\n\n00:06:52.958 --> 00:06:54.958\nthey very rarely move.\n\n00:06:54.958 --> 00:06:56.958\nMeat is a very different story\n\n00:06:56.958 --> 00:06:58.958\nbecause, of course, animals could walk into the city.\n\n00:06:58.958 --> 00:07:00.958\nSo much of London's meat\n\n00:07:00.958 --> 00:07:02.958\nwas coming from the northwest,\n\n00:07:02.958 --> 00:07:04.958\nfrom Scotland and Wales.\n\n00:07:04.958 --> 00:07:07.958\nSo it was coming in, and arriving at the city at the northwest,\n\n00:07:07.958 --> 00:07:09.958\nwhich is why Smithfield,\n\n00:07:09.958 --> 00:07:12.958\nLondon's very famous meat market, was located up there.\n\n00:07:12.958 --> 00:07:16.958\nPoultry was coming in from East Anglia and so on, to the northeast.\n\n00:07:16.958 --> 00:07:17.958\nI feel a bit like a weather woman doing this. Anyway,\n\n00:07:17.958 --> 00:07:21.958\nand so the birds were coming in\n\n00:07:21.958 --> 00:07:24.958\nwith their feet protected with little canvas shoes.\n\n00:07:24.958 --> 00:07:26.958\nAnd then when they hit the eastern end\n\n00:07:26.958 --> 00:07:28.958\nof Cheapside, that's where they were sold,\n\n00:07:28.958 --> 00:07:30.958\nwhich is why it's called Poultry.\n\n00:07:30.958 --> 00:07:33.958\nAnd, in fact, if you look at the map of any city\n\n00:07:33.958 --> 00:07:37.958\nbuilt before the industrial age,\n\n00:07:37.958 --> 00:07:39.958\nyou can trace food coming in to it.\n\n00:07:39.958 --> 00:07:42.958\nYou can actually see how it was physically shaped by food,\n\n00:07:42.958 --> 00:07:45.958\nboth by reading the names of the streets, which give you a lot of clues.\n\n00:07:45.958 --> 00:07:47.958\nFriday Street, in a previous life,\n\n00:07:47.958 --> 00:07:49.958\nis where you went to buy your fish on a Friday.\n\n00:07:49.958 --> 00:07:51.958\nBut also you have to imagine it full of food.\n\n00:07:51.958 --> 00:07:54.958\nBecause the streets and the public spaces\n\n00:07:54.958 --> 00:07:57.958\nwere the only places where food was bought and sold.\n\n00:07:57.958 --> 00:08:00.958\nAnd if we look at an image of Smithfield in 1830\n\n00:08:00.958 --> 00:08:03.958\nyou can see that it would have been very difficult to live in a city like this\n\n00:08:03.958 --> 00:08:05.958\nand be unaware of where your food came from.\n\n00:08:05.958 --> 00:08:07.958\nIn fact, if you were having Sunday lunch,\n\n00:08:07.958 --> 00:08:09.958\nthe chances were it was mooing or bleating outside your window\n\n00:08:09.958 --> 00:08:11.958\nabout three days earlier.\n\n00:08:11.958 --> 00:08:14.958\nSo this was obviously an organic city,\n\n00:08:14.958 --> 00:08:17.958\npart of an organic cycle.\n\n00:08:17.958 --> 00:08:20.958\nAnd then 10 years later everything changed.\n\n00:08:20.958 --> 00:08:23.958\nThis is an image of the Great Western in 1840.\n\n00:08:23.958 --> 00:08:25.958\nAnd as you can see, some of the earliest train passengers\n\n00:08:25.958 --> 00:08:27.958\nwere pigs and sheep.\n\n00:08:27.958 --> 00:08:31.958\nSo all of a sudden, these animals are no longer walking into market.\n\n00:08:31.958 --> 00:08:33.958\nThey're being slaughtered out of sight and mind,\n\n00:08:33.958 --> 00:08:35.958\nsomewhere in the countryside.\n\n00:08:35.958 --> 00:08:37.958\nAnd they're coming into the city by rail.\n\n00:08:37.958 --> 00:08:40.958\nAnd this changes everything.\n\n00:08:40.958 --> 00:08:42.958\nTo start off with, it makes it possible\n\n00:08:42.958 --> 00:08:43.958\nfor the first time to grow cities,\n\n00:08:43.958 --> 00:08:45.958\nreally any size and shape, in any place.\n\n00:08:45.958 --> 00:08:49.958\nCities used to be constrained by geography;\n\n00:08:49.958 --> 00:08:52.958\nthey used to have to get their food through very difficult physical means.\n\n00:08:52.958 --> 00:08:56.958\nAll of a sudden they are effectively emancipated from geography.\n\n00:08:56.958 --> 00:08:59.958\nAnd as you can see from these maps of London,\n\n00:08:59.958 --> 00:09:01.958\nin the 90 years after the trains came,\n\n00:09:01.958 --> 00:09:05.958\nit goes from being a little blob that was quite easy to feed\n\n00:09:05.958 --> 00:09:07.958\nby animals coming in on foot, and so on,\n\n00:09:07.958 --> 00:09:09.958\nto a large splurge,\n\n00:09:09.958 --> 00:09:12.958\nthat would be very, very difficult to feed with anybody on foot,\n\n00:09:12.958 --> 00:09:15.958\neither animals or people.\n\n00:09:15.958 --> 00:09:18.958\nAnd of course that was just the beginning. After the trains came cars,\n\n00:09:18.958 --> 00:09:22.958\nand really this marks the end of this process.\n\n00:09:22.958 --> 00:09:24.958\nIt's the final emancipation of the city\n\n00:09:24.958 --> 00:09:27.958\nfrom any apparent relationship with nature at all.\n\n00:09:27.958 --> 00:09:30.958\nAnd this is the kind of city that's devoid of smell,\n\n00:09:30.958 --> 00:09:32.958\ndevoid of mess, certainly devoid of people,\n\n00:09:32.958 --> 00:09:35.958\nbecause nobody would have dreamed of walking in such a landscape.\n\n00:09:35.958 --> 00:09:38.958\nIn fact, what they did to get food was they got in their cars,\n\n00:09:38.958 --> 00:09:41.958\ndrove to a box somewhere on the outskirts,\n\n00:09:41.958 --> 00:09:43.958\ncame back with a week's worth of shopping,\n\n00:09:43.958 --> 00:09:45.958\nand wondered what on earth to do with it.\n\n00:09:45.958 --> 00:09:48.958\nAnd this really is the moment when our relationship,\n\n00:09:48.958 --> 00:09:51.958\nboth with food and cities, changes completely.\n\n00:09:51.958 --> 00:09:54.958\nHere we have food -- that used to be the center,\n\n00:09:54.958 --> 00:09:57.958\nthe social core of the city -- at the periphery.\n\n00:09:57.958 --> 00:09:59.958\nIt used to be a social event, buying and selling food.\n\n00:09:59.958 --> 00:10:01.958\nNow it's anonymous.\n\n00:10:01.958 --> 00:10:03.958\nWe used to cook; now we just add water,\n\n00:10:03.958 --> 00:10:08.958\nor a little bit of an egg if you're making a cake or something.\n\n00:10:08.958 --> 00:10:12.958\nWe don't smell food to see if it's okay to eat.\n\n00:10:12.958 --> 00:10:15.958\nWe just read the back of a label on a packet.\n\n00:10:15.958 --> 00:10:18.958\nAnd we don't value food. We don't trust it.\n\n00:10:18.958 --> 00:10:20.958\nSo instead of trusting it, we fear it.\n\n00:10:20.958 --> 00:10:24.958\nAnd instead of valuing it, we throw it away.\n\n00:10:24.958 --> 00:10:27.958\nOne of the great ironies of modern food systems\n\n00:10:27.958 --> 00:10:29.958\nis that they've made the very thing they promised\n\n00:10:29.958 --> 00:10:31.958\nto make easier much harder.\n\n00:10:31.958 --> 00:10:35.958\nBy making it possible to build cities anywhere and any place,\n\n00:10:35.958 --> 00:10:39.958\nthey've actually distanced us from our most important relationship,\n\n00:10:39.958 --> 00:10:42.958\nwhich is that of us and nature.\n\n00:10:42.958 --> 00:10:45.958\nAnd also they've made us dependent on systems that only they can deliver,\n\n00:10:45.958 --> 00:10:47.958\nthat, as we've seen, are unsustainable.\n\n00:10:47.958 --> 00:10:50.958\nSo what are we going to do about that?\n\n00:10:50.958 --> 00:10:52.958\nIt's not a new question.\n\n00:10:52.958 --> 00:10:56.958\n500 years ago it's what Thomas More was asking himself.\n\n00:10:56.958 --> 00:10:59.958\nThis is the frontispiece of his book \"Utopia.\"\n\n00:10:59.958 --> 00:11:02.958\nAnd it was a series of semi-independent city-states,\n\n00:11:02.958 --> 00:11:04.958\nif that sounds remotely familiar,\n\n00:11:04.958 --> 00:11:07.958\na day's walk from one another where everyone was basically farming-mad,\n\n00:11:07.958 --> 00:11:09.958\nand grew vegetables in their back gardens,\n\n00:11:09.958 --> 00:11:11.958\nand ate communal meals together, and so on.\n\n00:11:11.958 --> 00:11:13.958\nAnd I think you could argue that\n\n00:11:13.958 --> 00:11:16.958\nfood is a fundamental ordering principle of Utopia,\n\n00:11:16.958 --> 00:11:19.958\neven though More never framed it that way.\n\n00:11:19.958 --> 00:11:22.958\nAnd here is another very famous \"Utopian\" vision,\n\n00:11:22.958 --> 00:11:24.958\nthat of Ebenezer Howard, \"The Garden City.\"\n\n00:11:24.958 --> 00:11:27.958\nSame idea: series of semi-independent city-states,\n\n00:11:27.958 --> 00:11:31.958\nlittle blobs of metropolitan stuff with arable land around,\n\n00:11:31.958 --> 00:11:33.958\njoined to one another by railway.\n\n00:11:33.958 --> 00:11:35.958\nAnd again, food could be said to be\n\n00:11:35.958 --> 00:11:38.958\nthe ordering principle of his vision.\n\n00:11:38.958 --> 00:11:40.958\nIt even got built, but nothing to do with\n\n00:11:40.958 --> 00:11:42.958\nthis vision that Howard had.\n\n00:11:42.958 --> 00:11:45.958\nAnd that is the problem with these Utopian ideas,\n\n00:11:45.958 --> 00:11:47.958\nthat they are Utopian.\n\n00:11:47.958 --> 00:11:50.958\nUtopia was actually a word that Thomas Moore used deliberately.\n\n00:11:50.958 --> 00:11:54.958\nIt was a kind of joke, because it's got a double derivation from the Greek.\n\n00:11:54.958 --> 00:11:56.958\nIt can either mean a good place, or no place.\n\n00:11:56.958 --> 00:12:00.958\nBecause it's an ideal. It's an imaginary thing. We can't have it.\n\n00:12:00.958 --> 00:12:02.958\nAnd I think, as a conceptual tool\n\n00:12:02.958 --> 00:12:05.958\nfor thinking about the very deep problem of human dwelling,\n\n00:12:05.958 --> 00:12:07.958\nthat makes it not much use.\n\n00:12:07.958 --> 00:12:10.958\nSo I've come up with an alternative,\n\n00:12:10.958 --> 00:12:13.958\nwhich is Sitopia, from the ancient Greek,\n\n00:12:13.958 --> 00:12:15.958\n\"sitos\" for food, and \"topos\" for place.\n\n00:12:15.958 --> 00:12:17.958\nI believe we already live in Sitopia.\n\n00:12:17.958 --> 00:12:20.958\nWe live in a world shaped by food,\n\n00:12:20.958 --> 00:12:23.958\nand if we realize that, we can use food as a really powerful tool --\n\n00:12:23.958 --> 00:12:27.958\na conceptual tool, design tool, to shape the world differently.\n\n00:12:27.958 --> 00:12:32.958\nSo if we were to do that, what might Sitopia look like?\n\n00:12:32.958 --> 00:12:34.958\nWell I think it looks a bit like this.\n\n00:12:34.958 --> 00:12:36.958\nI have to use this slide. It's just the look on the face of the dog.\n\n00:12:36.958 --> 00:12:39.958\nBut anyway, this is -- (Laughter)\n\n00:12:39.958 --> 00:12:41.958\nit's food at the center of life,\n\n00:12:41.958 --> 00:12:43.958\nat the center of family life, being celebrated,\n\n00:12:43.958 --> 00:12:45.958\nbeing enjoyed, people taking time for it.\n\n00:12:45.958 --> 00:12:48.958\nThis is where food should be in our society.\n\n00:12:48.958 --> 00:12:53.958\nBut you can't have scenes like this unless you have people like this.\n\n00:12:53.958 --> 00:12:55.958\nBy the way, these can be men as well.\n\n00:12:55.958 --> 00:12:58.958\nIt's people who think about food,\n\n00:12:58.958 --> 00:13:00.958\nwho think ahead, who plan,\n\n00:13:00.958 --> 00:13:02.958\nwho can stare at a pile of raw vegetables\n\n00:13:02.958 --> 00:13:04.958\nand actually recognize them.\n\n00:13:04.958 --> 00:13:07.958\nWe need these people. We're part of a network.\n\n00:13:07.958 --> 00:13:10.958\nBecause without these kinds of people we can't have places like this.\n\n00:13:10.958 --> 00:13:13.958\nHere, I deliberately chose this because it is a man buying a vegetable.\n\n00:13:13.958 --> 00:13:17.958\nBut networks, markets where food is being grown locally.\n\n00:13:17.958 --> 00:13:19.958\nIt's common. It's fresh.\n\n00:13:19.958 --> 00:13:21.958\nIt's part of the social life of the city.\n\n00:13:21.958 --> 00:13:24.958\nBecause without that, you can't have this kind of place,\n\n00:13:24.958 --> 00:13:27.958\nfood that is grown locally and also is part of the landscape,\n\n00:13:27.958 --> 00:13:29.958\nand is not just a zero-sum commodity\n\n00:13:29.958 --> 00:13:31.958\noff in some unseen hell-hole.\n\n00:13:31.958 --> 00:13:33.958\nCows with a view.\n\n00:13:33.958 --> 00:13:35.958\nSteaming piles of humus.\n\n00:13:35.958 --> 00:13:38.958\nThis is basically bringing the whole thing together.\n\n00:13:38.958 --> 00:13:40.958\nAnd this is a community project\n\n00:13:40.958 --> 00:13:42.958\nI visited recently in Toronto.\n\n00:13:42.958 --> 00:13:44.958\nIt's a greenhouse, where kids get told\n\n00:13:44.958 --> 00:13:47.958\nall about food and growing their own food.\n\n00:13:47.958 --> 00:13:50.958\nHere is a plant called Kevin, or maybe it's a\n\n00:13:50.958 --> 00:13:52.958\nplant belonging to a kid called Kevin. I don't know.\n\n00:13:52.958 --> 00:13:55.958\nBut anyway, these kinds of projects\n\n00:13:55.958 --> 00:13:59.958\nthat are trying to reconnect us with nature is extremely important.\n\n00:13:59.958 --> 00:14:01.958\nSo Sitopia, for me, is really a way of seeing.\n\n00:14:01.958 --> 00:14:05.958\nIt's basically recognizing that Sitopia\n\n00:14:05.958 --> 00:14:07.958\nalready exists in little pockets everywhere.\n\n00:14:07.958 --> 00:14:09.958\nThe trick is to join them up,\n\n00:14:09.958 --> 00:14:12.958\nto use food as a way of seeing.\n\n00:14:12.958 --> 00:14:15.958\nAnd if we do that, we're going to stop seeing cities\n\n00:14:15.958 --> 00:14:18.958\nas big, metropolitan, unproductive blobs, like this.\n\n00:14:18.958 --> 00:14:20.958\nWe're going to see them more like this,\n\n00:14:20.958 --> 00:14:23.958\nas part of the productive, organic framework\n\n00:14:23.958 --> 00:14:25.958\nof which they are inevitably a part,\n\n00:14:25.958 --> 00:14:27.958\nsymbiotically connected.\n\n00:14:27.958 --> 00:14:29.958\nBut of course, that's not a great image either,\n\n00:14:29.958 --> 00:14:32.958\nbecause we need not to be producing food like this anymore.\n\n00:14:32.958 --> 00:14:34.958\nWe need to be thinking more about permaculture,\n\n00:14:34.958 --> 00:14:36.958\nwhich is why I think this image just\n\n00:14:36.958 --> 00:14:38.958\nsums up for me the kind of thinking we need to be doing.\n\n00:14:38.958 --> 00:14:40.958\nIt's a re-conceptualization\n\n00:14:40.958 --> 00:14:43.958\nof the way food shapes our lives.\n\n00:14:43.958 --> 00:14:46.958\nThe best image I know of this is from 650 years ago.\n\n00:14:46.958 --> 00:14:49.958\nIt's Ambrogio Lorenzetti's \"Allegory of Good Government.\"\n\n00:14:49.958 --> 00:14:52.958\nIt's about the relationship between the city and the countryside.\n\n00:14:52.958 --> 00:14:55.958\nAnd I think the message of this is very clear.\n\n00:14:55.958 --> 00:14:57.958\nIf the city looks after the country,\n\n00:14:57.958 --> 00:14:59.958\nthe country will look after the city.\n\n00:14:59.958 --> 00:15:01.958\nAnd I want us to ask now,\n\n00:15:01.958 --> 00:15:04.958\nwhat would Ambrogio Lorenzetti paint\n\n00:15:04.958 --> 00:15:06.958\nif he painted this image today?\n\n00:15:06.958 --> 00:15:09.958\nWhat would an allegory of good government look like today?\n\n00:15:09.958 --> 00:15:11.958\nBecause I think it's an urgent question.\n\n00:15:11.958 --> 00:15:13.958\nIt's one we have to ask,\n\n00:15:13.958 --> 00:15:15.958\nand we have to start answering.\n\n00:15:15.958 --> 00:15:18.958\nWe know we are what we eat.\n\n00:15:18.958 --> 00:15:20.958\nWe need to realize that the world is also what we eat.\n\n00:15:20.958 --> 00:15:22.958\nBut if we take that idea, we can use food\n\n00:15:22.958 --> 00:15:26.958\nas a really powerful tool to shape the world better.\n\n00:15:26.958 --> 00:15:28.958\nThank you very much.\n\n00:15:28.958 --> 00:15:31.958\n(Applause)"}, {"title": "Tribal leadership", "duration": "999", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/david_logan_on_tribal_leadership", "transcript": "What we're really here to talk about is the \"how.\" Okay, so how exactly do we create this world-shattering, if you will, innovation? Now, I want to tell you a quick story. We'll go back a little more than a year. In fact, the date \u2014 I'm curious to know if any of you know what happened on this momentous date? It was February 3rd, 2008. Anyone remember what happened, February 3rd, 2008? Super Bowl. I heard it over here. It was the date of the Super Bowl.And the reason that this date was so momentous is that what my colleagues, John King and Halee Fischer-Wright, and I noticed as we began to debrief various Super Bowl parties, is that it seemed to us that across the United States, if you will, tribal councils had convened. And they had discussed things of great national importance. Like, \"Do we like the Budweiser commercial?\" and, \"Do we like the nachos?\" and, \"Who is going to win?\" But they also talked about which candidate they were going to support.And if you go back in time to February 3rd, it looked like Hilary Clinton was going to get the Democratic nomination. And there were even some polls that were saying she was going to go all the way. But when we talked to people, it appeared that a funnel effect had happened in these tribes all across the United States. Now what is a tribe? A tribe is a group of about 20 \u2014 so kind of more than a team \u2014 20 to about 150 people. And it's within these tribes that all of our work gets done. But not just work. It's within these tribes that societies get built, that important things happen.And so as we surveyed the, if you will, representatives from various tribal councils that met, also known as Super Bowl parties, we sent the following email off to 40 newspaper editors the following day. February 4th, we posted it on our website. This was before Super Tuesday. We said, \"The tribes that we're in are saying it's going to be Obama.\" Now, the reason we knew that was because we spent the previous 10 years studying tribes, studying these naturally occurring groups.All of you are members of tribes. In walking around at the break, many of you had met members of your tribe. And you were talking to them. And many of you were doing what great, if you will, tribal leaders do, which is to find someone who is a member of a tribe, and to find someone else who is another member of a different tribe, and make introductions. That is in fact what great tribal leaders do.So here is the bottom line. If you focus in on a group like this \u2014 this happens to be a USC game \u2014 and you zoom in with one of those super satellite cameras and do magnification factors so you could see individual people, you would in fact see not a single crowd, just like there is not a single crowd here, but you would see these tribes that are then coming together. And from a distance it appears that it's a single group. And so people form tribes. They always have. They always will. Just as fish swim and birds fly, people form tribes. It's just what we do. But here's the rub. Not all tribes are the same, and what makes the difference is the culture.Now here is the net out of this. You're all a member of tribes. If you can find a way to take the tribes that you're in and nudge them forward, along these tribal stages to what we call Stage Five, which is the top of the mountain. But we're going to start with what we call Stage One. Now, this is the lowest of the stages. You don't want this. Okay? This is a bit of a difficult image to put up on the screen. But it's one that I think we need to learn from.Stage One produces people who do horrible things. This is the kid who shot up Virginia Tech. Stage One is a group where people systematically sever relationships from functional tribes, and then pool together with people who think like they do. Stage One is literally the culture of gangs and it is the culture of prisons. Now, again, we don't often deal with Stage One. And I want to make the point that as members of society, we need to. It's not enough to simply write people off.But let's move on to Stage Two. Now, Stage One, you'll notice, says, in effect, \"Life Sucks.\" So, this other book that Steve mentioned, that just came out, called \"The Three Laws of Performance,\" my colleague, Steve Zaffron and I, argue that as people see the world, so they behave. Well, if people see the world in such a way that life sucks, then their behavior will follow automatically from that. It will be despairing hostility. They'll do whatever it takes to survive, even if that means undermining other people.Now, my birthday is coming up shortly, and my driver's license expires. And the reason that that's relevant is that very soon I will be walking into what we call a Stage Two tribe, which looks like this. (Laughter) Now, am I saying that in every Department of Motor Vehicles across the land, you find a Stage Two culture? No. But in the one near me, where I have to go in just a few days, what I will say when I'm standing in line is, \"How can people be so dumb, and yet live?\" (Laughter)Now, am I saying that there are dumb people working here? Actually, no, I'm not. But I'm saying the culture makes people dumb. So in a Stage Two culture \u2014 and we find these in all sorts of different places \u2014 you find them, in fact, in the best organizations in the world. You find them in all places in society. I've come across them at the organizations that everybody raves about as being best in class. But here is the point. If you believe and you say to people in your tribe, in effect, \"My life sucks. I mean, if I got to go to TEDx USC my life wouldn't suck. But I don't. So it does.\" If that's how you talked, imagine what kind of work would get done. What kind of innovation would get done? The amount of world-changing behavior that would happen? In fact it would be basically nil.Now when we go on to Stage Three: this is the one that hits closest to home for many of us. Because it is in Stage Three that many of us move. And we park. And we stay. Stage Three says, \"I'm great. And you're not.\" (Laughter) I'm great and you're not. Now imagine having a whole room of people saying, in effect, \"I'm great and you're not.\" Or, \"I'm going to find some way to compete with you and come out on top as a result of that.\" A whole group of people communicating that way, talking that way.I know this sounds like a joke. Three doctors walk into a bar. But, in this case, three doctors walk into an elevator. I happened to be in the elevator collecting data for this book. And one doctor said to the others, \"Did you see my article in the New England Journal of Medicine?\" And the other said, \"No. That's great. Congratulations!\"The next one got kind of a wry smile on his face and said, \"Well while you were, you know, doing your research,\" \u2014 notice the condescending tone \u2014 \"While you were off doing your research, I was off doing more surgeries than anyone else in the department of surgery at this institution.\"And the third one got the same wry smile and said, \"Well, while you were off doing your research, and you were off doing your monkey meatball surgery, that eventually we'll train monkeys to do, or cells or robots, or maybe not even need to do it at all, I was off running the future of the residency program, which is really the future of medicine.\"And they all kind of laughed and they patted him on the back. And the elevator door opened, and they all walked out. That is a meeting of a Stage Three tribe. Now, we find these in places where really smart, successful people show up. Like, oh, I don't know, TEDx USC. (Laughter)Here is the greatest challenge we face in innovation. It is moving from Stage Three to Stage Four. Let's take a look at a quick video snippet. This is from a company called Zappos, located outside Las Vegas. And my question on the other side is just going to be, \"What do you think they value?\" It was not Christmas time. There was a Christmas tree. This is their lobby. Employees volunteer time in the advice booth. Notice it looks like something out of a Peanuts cartoon.Okay, we're going through the hallway here at Zappos. This is a call center. Notice how it's decorated. Notice people are applauding for us. They don't know who we are and they don't care. And if they did they probably wouldn't applaud. But you'll notice the level of excitement. Notice, again, how they decorate their office. Now, what's important to people at Zappos, these may not be the things that are important to you. But they value things like fun. And they value creativity. One of their stated values is, \"Be a little bit weird.\" And you'll notice they are a little bit weird.So when individuals come together and find something that unites them that's greater than their individual competence, then something very important happens. The group gels. And it changes from a group of highly motivated but fairly individually-centric people into something larger, into a tribe that becomes aware of its own existence. Stage Four tribes can do remarkable things. But you'll notice we're not at the top of the mountain yet. There is, in fact, another stage.Now, some of you may not recognize the scene that's up here. And if you take a look at the headline of Stage Five, which is \"Life is Great,\" this may seem a little incongruous. This is a scene or snippet from the Truth and Reconciliation process in South Africa for which Desmond Tutu won the Nobel Prize. Now think about that. South Africa, terrible atrocities had happened in the society. And people came together focused only on those two values: truth and reconciliation. There was no road map. No one had ever done anything like this before.And in this atmosphere, where the only guidance was people's values and their noble cause, what this group accomplished was historic. And people, at the time, feared that South Africa would end up going the way that Rwanda has gone, descending into one skirmish after another in a civil war that seems to have no end. In fact, South Africa has not gone down that road. Largely because people like Desmond Tutu set up a Stage Five process to involve the thousands and perhaps millions of tribes in the country, to bring everyone together. So, people hear this and they conclude the following, as did we in doing the study.Okay, got it. I don't want to talk Stage One. That's like, you know, \"Life sucks.\" Who wants to talk that way? I don't want to talk like they do at the particular DMV that's close to where Dave lives. I really don't want to just say \"I'm great,\" because that kind of sounds narcissistic, and then I won't have any friends. Saying, \"We're great\" \u2014 that sounds pretty good. But I should really talk Stage Five, right? \"Life is great.\"Well, in fact, there are three somewhat counter-intuitive findings that come out of all this. The first one, if you look at the Declaration of Independence and actually read it, the phrase that sticks in many of our minds is things about inalienable rights. I mean, that's Stage Five, right? Life is great, oriented only by our values, no other guidance. In fact, most of the document is written at Stage Two. \"My life sucks because I live under a tyrant, also known as King George. We're great! Who is not great? England!\" Sorry. (Laughter)Well, what about other great leaders? What about Gandhi? What about Martin Luther King? I mean, surely these were just people who preached, \"Life is great,\" right? Just one little bit of happiness and joy after another. In fact, Martin Luther King's most famous line was at Stage Three. He didn't say \"We have a dream.\" He said, \"I have a dream.\" Why did he do that? Because most people are not at Stage Five.Two percent are at Stage One. About 25 percent are at Stage Two, saying, in effect, \"My life sucks.\" 48 percent of working tribes say, these are employed tribes, say, \"I'm great and you're not.\" And we have to duke it out every day, so we resort to politics. Only about 22 percent of tribes are at Stage Four, oriented by our values, saying \"We're great. And our values are beginning to unite us.\" Only two percent, only two percent of tribes get to Stage Five. And those are the ones that change the world.So the first little finding from this is that leaders need to be able to talk all the levels so that you can touch every person in society. But you don't leave them where you found them. Okay? Tribes can only hear one level above and below where they are. So we have to have the ability to talk all the levels, to go to where they are. And then leaders nudge people within their tribes to the next level. I'd like to show you some examples of this.One of the people we interviewed was Frank Jordan, former Mayor of San Francisco. Before that he was Chief of Police in San Francisco. And he grew up essentially in Stage One. And you know what changed his life? It was walking into one of these, a Boys and Girls Club. Now here is what happened to this person who eventually became Mayor of San Francisco. He went from being alive and passionate at Stage One \u2014 remember, \"Life sucks, despairing hostility, I will do whatever it takes to survive\" \u2014 to walking into a Boys and Girls Club, folding his arms, sitting down in a chair, and saying, \"Wow. My life really sucks. I don't know anybody. I mean, if I was into boxing, like they were, then my life wouldn't suck. But I don't. So it does. So I'm going to sit here in my chair and not do anything.\"In fact, that's progress. We move people from Stage One to Stage Two by getting them in a new tribe and then, over time, getting them connected. So, what about moving from Stage Three to Stage Four? I want to argue that we're doing that right here. TED represents a set of values, and as we unite around these values, something really interesting begins to emerge.If you want this experience to live on as something historic, then at the reception tonight I'd like to encourage you to do something beyond what people normally do and call networking. Which is not just to meet new people and extend your reach, extend your influence, but instead, find someone you don't know, and find someone else you don't know, and introduce them. That's called a triadic relationship.See, people who build world-changing tribes do that. They extend the reach of their tribes by connecting them, not just to myself, so that my following is greater, but I connect people who don't know each other to something greater than themselves. And ultimately that adds to their values.But we're not done yet. Because then how do we go from Stage Four, which is great, to Stage Five? The story that I like to end with is this. It comes out of a place called the Gallup Organization. You know they do polls, right? So it's Stage Four. We're great. Who is not great? Pretty much everybody else who does polls. If Gallup releases a poll on the same day that NBC releases a poll, people will pay attention to the Gallup poll. Okay, we understand that. So, they were bored. They wanted to change the world. So here is the question someone asked.\"How could we, instead of just polling what Asia thinks or what the United States thinks, or who thinks what about Obama versus McCain or something like that, what does the entire world think?\" And they found a way to do the first-ever world poll. They had people involved who were Nobel laureates in economics, who reported being bored. And suddenly they pulled out sheets of paper and were trying to figure out, \"How do we survey the population of Sub-Saharan Africa? How do we survey populations that don't have access to technology, and speak languages we don't speak, and we don't know anyone who speaks those languages. Because in order to achieve on this great mission, we have to be able to do it. Incidentally, they did pull it off. And they released the first-ever world poll.So I'd like to leave you with these thoughts. First of all: we all form tribes, all of us. You're in tribes here. Hopefully you're extending the reach of the tribes that you have. But the question on the table is this: What kind of an impact are the tribes that you are in making? You're hearing one presentation after another, often representing a group of people, a tribe, about how they have changed the world. If you do what we've talked about, you listen for how people actually communicate in the tribes that you're in. And you don't leave them where they are. You nudge them forward. You remember to talk all five culture stages. Because we've got people in all five, around us. And the question that I'd like to leave you with is this: Will your tribes change the world? Thank you very much.

It's within these tribes\n\n00:01:42.958 --> 00:01:44.958\nthat societies get built,\n\n00:01:44.958 --> 00:01:46.958\nthat important things happen.\n\n00:01:46.958 --> 00:01:49.958\nAnd so as we surveyed the, if you will, representatives\n\n00:01:49.958 --> 00:01:51.958\nfrom various tribal councils that met,\n\n00:01:51.958 --> 00:01:53.958\nalso known as Super Bowl parties,\n\n00:01:53.958 --> 00:01:56.958\nwe sent the following email off to 40 newspaper editors the following day.\n\n00:01:56.958 --> 00:02:00.958\nFebruary 4th, we posted it on our website. This was before Super Tuesday.\n\n00:02:00.958 --> 00:02:02.958\nWe said, \"The tribes that we're in\n\n00:02:02.958 --> 00:02:04.958\nare saying it's going to be Obama.\"\n\n00:02:04.958 --> 00:02:06.958\nNow, the reason we knew that\n\n00:02:06.958 --> 00:02:09.958\nwas because we spent the previous 10 years\n\n00:02:09.958 --> 00:02:13.958\nstudying tribes, studying these naturally occurring groups.\n\n00:02:13.958 --> 00:02:15.958\nAll of you are members of tribes.\n\n00:02:15.958 --> 00:02:18.958\nIn walking around at the break,\n\n00:02:18.958 --> 00:02:21.958\nmany of you had met members of your tribe. And you were talking to them.\n\n00:02:21.958 --> 00:02:25.958\nAnd many of you were doing what great, if you will, tribal leaders do,\n\n00:02:25.958 --> 00:02:27.958\nwhich is to find someone\n\n00:02:27.958 --> 00:02:29.958\nwho is a member of a tribe,\n\n00:02:29.958 --> 00:02:32.958\nand to find someone else who is another member of a different tribe,\n\n00:02:32.958 --> 00:02:34.958\nand make introductions.\n\n00:02:34.958 --> 00:02:37.958\nThat is in fact what great tribal leaders do.\n\n00:02:37.958 --> 00:02:39.958\nSo here is the bottom line.\n\n00:02:39.958 --> 00:02:42.958\nIf you focus in on a group like this --\n\n00:02:42.958 --> 00:02:44.958\nthis happens to be a USC game --\n\n00:02:44.958 --> 00:02:47.958\nand you zoom in with one of those super satellite cameras\n\n00:02:47.958 --> 00:02:51.958\nand do magnification factors so you could see individual people,\n\n00:02:51.958 --> 00:02:53.958\nyou would in fact see not a single crowd,\n\n00:02:53.958 --> 00:02:55.958\njust like there is not a single crowd here,\n\n00:02:55.958 --> 00:02:58.958\nbut you would see these tribes that are then coming together.\n\n00:02:58.958 --> 00:03:02.958\nAnd from a distance it appears that it's a single group.\n\n00:03:02.958 --> 00:03:04.958\nAnd so people form tribes.\n\n00:03:04.958 --> 00:03:07.958\nThey always have. They always will.\n\n00:03:07.958 --> 00:03:09.958\nJust as fish swim and birds fly,\n\n00:03:09.958 --> 00:03:11.958\npeople form tribes. It's just what we do.\n\n00:03:11.958 --> 00:03:13.958\nBut here's the rub.\n\n00:03:13.958 --> 00:03:15.958\nNot all tribes are the same,\n\n00:03:15.958 --> 00:03:17.958\nand what makes the difference is the culture.\n\n00:03:17.958 --> 00:03:19.958\nNow here is the net out of this.\n\n00:03:19.958 --> 00:03:21.958\nYou're all a member of tribes.\n\n00:03:21.958 --> 00:03:24.958\nIf you can find a way to take the tribes that you're in\n\n00:03:24.958 --> 00:03:26.958\nand nudge them forward,\n\n00:03:26.958 --> 00:03:28.958\nalong these tribal stages\n\n00:03:28.958 --> 00:03:31.958\nto what we call Stage Five, which is the top of the mountain.\n\n00:03:31.958 --> 00:03:34.958\nBut we're going to start with what we call Stage One.\n\n00:03:34.958 --> 00:03:36.958\nNow, this is the lowest of the stages.\n\n00:03:36.958 --> 00:03:38.958\nYou don't want this. Okay?\n\n00:03:38.958 --> 00:03:41.958\nThis is a bit of a difficult image to put up on the screen.\n\n00:03:41.958 --> 00:03:43.958\nBut it's one that I think we need to learn from.\n\n00:03:43.958 --> 00:03:45.958\nStage One produces people\n\n00:03:45.958 --> 00:03:47.958\nwho do horrible things.\n\n00:03:47.958 --> 00:03:49.958\nThis is the kid who shot up Virginia Tech.\n\n00:03:49.958 --> 00:03:51.958\nStage One is a group where people\n\n00:03:51.958 --> 00:03:54.958\nsystematically sever relationships from functional tribes,\n\n00:03:54.958 --> 00:03:56.958\nand then pool together\n\n00:03:56.958 --> 00:03:58.958\nwith people who think like they do.\n\n00:03:58.958 --> 00:04:01.958\nStage One is literally the culture of gangs\n\n00:04:01.958 --> 00:04:03.958\nand it is the culture of prisons.\n\n00:04:03.958 --> 00:04:05.958\nNow, again, we don't often deal with Stage One.\n\n00:04:05.958 --> 00:04:07.958\nAnd I want to make the point\n\n00:04:07.958 --> 00:04:09.958\nthat as members of society, we need to.\n\n00:04:09.958 --> 00:04:12.958\nIt's not enough to simply write people off.\n\n00:04:12.958 --> 00:04:14.958\nBut let's move on to Stage Two.\n\n00:04:14.958 --> 00:04:18.958\nNow, Stage One, you'll notice, says, in effect, \"Life Sucks.\"\n\n00:04:18.958 --> 00:04:21.958\nSo, this other book that Steve mentioned,\n\n00:04:21.958 --> 00:04:23.958\nthat just came out, called \"The Three Laws of Performance,\"\n\n00:04:23.958 --> 00:04:26.958\nmy colleague, Steve Zaffron and I,\n\n00:04:26.958 --> 00:04:30.958\nargue that as people see the world, so they behave.\n\n00:04:30.958 --> 00:04:34.958\nWell, if people see the world in such a way that life sucks,\n\n00:04:34.958 --> 00:04:37.958\nthen their behavior will follow automatically from that.\n\n00:04:37.958 --> 00:04:39.958\nIt will be despairing hostility.\n\n00:04:39.958 --> 00:04:41.958\nThey'll do whatever it takes to survive,\n\n00:04:41.958 --> 00:04:44.958\neven if that means undermining other people.\n\n00:04:44.958 --> 00:04:47.958\nNow, my birthday is coming up shortly,\n\n00:04:47.958 --> 00:04:49.958\nand my driver's license expires.\n\n00:04:49.958 --> 00:04:51.958\nAnd the reason that that's relevant is that very soon\n\n00:04:51.958 --> 00:04:53.958\nI will be walking into what we call\n\n00:04:53.958 --> 00:04:55.958\na Stage Two tribe,\n\n00:04:55.958 --> 00:04:57.958\nwhich looks like this.\n\n00:04:57.958 --> 00:04:58.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:04:58.958 --> 00:05:00.958\nNow, am I saying that in every Department of Motor Vehicles\n\n00:05:00.958 --> 00:05:03.958\nacross the land, you find a Stage Two culture?\n\n00:05:03.958 --> 00:05:05.958\nNo. But in the one near me,\n\n00:05:05.958 --> 00:05:07.958\nwhere I have to go in just a few days,\n\n00:05:07.958 --> 00:05:09.958\nwhat I will say when I'm standing in line is,\n\n00:05:09.958 --> 00:05:12.958\n\"How can people be so dumb, and yet live?\"\n\n00:05:12.958 --> 00:05:15.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:05:15.958 --> 00:05:18.958\nNow, am I saying that there are dumb people working here?\n\n00:05:18.958 --> 00:05:20.958\nActually, no, I'm not.\n\n00:05:20.958 --> 00:05:24.958\nBut I'm saying the culture makes people dumb.\n\n00:05:24.958 --> 00:05:26.958\nSo in a Stage Two culture --\n\n00:05:26.958 --> 00:05:28.958\nand we find these in all sorts of different places --\n\n00:05:28.958 --> 00:05:31.958\nyou find them, in fact, in the best organizations in the world.\n\n00:05:31.958 --> 00:05:33.958\nYou find them in all places in society.\n\n00:05:33.958 --> 00:05:36.958\nI've come across them at the organizations\n\n00:05:36.958 --> 00:05:38.958\nthat everybody raves about as being best in class.\n\n00:05:38.958 --> 00:05:40.958\nBut here is the point. If you believe and you say\n\n00:05:40.958 --> 00:05:42.958\nto people in your tribe, in effect,\n\n00:05:42.958 --> 00:05:44.958\n\"My life sucks.\n\n00:05:44.958 --> 00:05:46.958\nI mean, if I got to go to TEDx USC\n\n00:05:46.958 --> 00:05:48.958\nmy life wouldn't suck. But I don't. So it does.\"\n\n00:05:48.958 --> 00:05:52.958\nIf that's how you talked, imagine what kind of work would get done.\n\n00:05:52.958 --> 00:05:54.958\nWhat kind of innovation would get done?\n\n00:05:54.958 --> 00:05:57.958\nThe amount of world-changing behavior that would happen?\n\n00:05:57.958 --> 00:06:00.958\nIn fact it would be basically nil.\n\n00:06:00.958 --> 00:06:02.958\nNow when we go on to Stage Three: this is the one\n\n00:06:02.958 --> 00:06:05.958\nthat hits closest to home for many of us.\n\n00:06:05.958 --> 00:06:08.958\nBecause it is in Stage Three that many of us move.\n\n00:06:08.958 --> 00:06:10.958\nAnd we park. And we stay.\n\n00:06:10.958 --> 00:06:15.958\nStage Three says, \"I'm great. And you're not.\"\n\n00:06:15.958 --> 00:06:16.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:06:16.958 --> 00:06:19.958\nI'm great and you're not.\n\n00:06:19.958 --> 00:06:21.958\nNow imagine having a whole room of people\n\n00:06:21.958 --> 00:06:23.958\nsaying, in effect, \"I'm great and you're not.\"\n\n00:06:23.958 --> 00:06:26.958\nOr, \"I'm going to find some way to compete with you\n\n00:06:26.958 --> 00:06:28.958\nand come out on top as a result of that.\"\n\n00:06:28.958 --> 00:06:32.958\nA whole group of people communicating that way, talking that way.\n\n00:06:32.958 --> 00:06:35.958\nI know this sounds like a joke. Three doctors walk into a bar.\n\n00:06:35.958 --> 00:06:37.958\nBut, in this case, three doctors walk into an elevator.\n\n00:06:37.958 --> 00:06:40.958\nI happened to be in the elevator collecting data for this book.\n\n00:06:40.958 --> 00:06:42.958\nAnd one doctor said to the others, \"Did you see my article\n\n00:06:42.958 --> 00:06:44.958\nin the New England Journal of Medicine?\"\n\n00:06:44.958 --> 00:06:47.958\nAnd the other said, \"No. That's great. Congratulations!\"\n\n00:06:47.958 --> 00:06:50.958\nThe next one got kind of a wry smile on his face and said,\n\n00:06:50.958 --> 00:06:53.958\n\"Well while you were, you know, doing your research,\" --\n\n00:06:53.958 --> 00:06:55.958\nnotice the condescending tone --\n\n00:06:55.958 --> 00:06:58.958\n\"While you were off doing your research, I was off doing more surgeries\n\n00:06:58.958 --> 00:07:01.958\nthan anyone else in the department of surgery at this institution.\"\n\n00:07:01.958 --> 00:07:03.958\nAnd the third one got the same wry smile and said,\n\n00:07:03.958 --> 00:07:06.958\n\"Well, while you were off doing your research,\n\n00:07:06.958 --> 00:07:08.958\nand you were off doing your monkey meatball surgery,\n\n00:07:08.958 --> 00:07:11.958\nthat eventually we'll train monkeys to do,\n\n00:07:11.958 --> 00:07:14.958\nor cells or robots, or maybe not even need to do it at all,\n\n00:07:14.958 --> 00:07:16.958\nI was off running the future of the residency program,\n\n00:07:16.958 --> 00:07:18.958\nwhich is really the future of medicine.\"\n\n00:07:18.958 --> 00:07:20.958\nAnd they all kind of laughed and they patted him on the back.\n\n00:07:20.958 --> 00:07:22.958\nAnd the elevator door opened, and they all walked out.\n\n00:07:22.958 --> 00:07:24.958\nThat is a meeting of a Stage Three tribe.\n\n00:07:24.958 --> 00:07:28.958\nNow, we find these in places\n\n00:07:28.958 --> 00:07:31.958\nwhere really smart, successful people show up.\n\n00:07:31.958 --> 00:07:35.958\nLike, oh, I don't know, TEDx USC.\n\n00:07:35.958 --> 00:07:36.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:07:36.958 --> 00:07:39.958\nHere is the greatest challenge we face in innovation.\n\n00:07:39.958 --> 00:07:41.958\nIt is moving from Stage Three\n\n00:07:41.958 --> 00:07:43.958\nto Stage Four.\n\n00:07:43.958 --> 00:07:46.958\nLet's take a look at a quick video snippet.\n\n00:07:46.958 --> 00:07:49.958\nThis is from a company called Zappos, located outside Las Vegas.\n\n00:07:49.958 --> 00:07:52.958\nAnd my question on the other side is just going to be,\n\n00:07:52.958 --> 00:07:54.958\n\"What do you think they value?\"\n\n00:07:54.958 --> 00:07:58.958\nIt was not Christmas time. There was a Christmas tree.\n\n00:07:58.958 --> 00:08:00.958\nThis is their lobby.\n\n00:08:06.958 --> 00:08:08.958\nEmployees volunteer time in the advice booth.\n\n00:08:08.958 --> 00:08:11.958\nNotice it looks like something out of a Peanuts cartoon.\n\n00:08:11.958 --> 00:08:14.958\nOkay, we're going through the hallway here at Zappos.\n\n00:08:14.958 --> 00:08:16.958\nThis is a call center. Notice how it's decorated.\n\n00:08:16.958 --> 00:08:19.958\nNotice people are applauding for us.\n\n00:08:19.958 --> 00:08:21.958\nThey don't know who we are and they don't care. And if they did\n\n00:08:21.958 --> 00:08:23.958\nthey probably wouldn't applaud.\n\n00:08:25.958 --> 00:08:27.958\nBut you'll notice the level of excitement.\n\n00:08:27.958 --> 00:08:29.958\nNotice, again, how they decorate their office.\n\n00:08:29.958 --> 00:08:31.958\nNow, what's important to people at Zappos,\n\n00:08:31.958 --> 00:08:33.958\nthese may not be the things that are important to you.\n\n00:08:33.958 --> 00:08:36.958\nBut they value things like fun. And they value creativity.\n\n00:08:36.958 --> 00:08:39.958\nOne of their stated values is, \"Be a little bit weird.\"\n\n00:08:39.958 --> 00:08:43.958\nAnd you'll notice they are a little bit weird.\n\n00:08:43.958 --> 00:08:45.958\nSo when individuals come together\n\n00:08:45.958 --> 00:08:47.958\nand find something that unites them\n\n00:08:47.958 --> 00:08:50.958\nthat's greater than their individual competence,\n\n00:08:50.958 --> 00:08:52.958\nthen something very important happens.\n\n00:08:52.958 --> 00:08:55.958\nThe group gels. And it changes\n\n00:08:55.958 --> 00:08:57.958\nfrom a group of highly motivated\n\n00:08:57.958 --> 00:09:00.958\nbut fairly individually-centric people\n\n00:09:00.958 --> 00:09:02.958\ninto something larger,\n\n00:09:02.958 --> 00:09:05.958\ninto a tribe that becomes aware of its own existence.\n\n00:09:05.958 --> 00:09:08.958\nStage Four tribes can do remarkable things.\n\n00:09:08.958 --> 00:09:11.958\nBut you'll notice we're not at the top of the mountain yet.\n\n00:09:11.958 --> 00:09:13.958\nThere is, in fact, another stage.\n\n00:09:13.958 --> 00:09:16.958\nNow, some of you may not recognize the scene that's up here.\n\n00:09:16.958 --> 00:09:20.958\nAnd if you take a look at the headline of Stage Five, which is \"Life is Great,\"\n\n00:09:20.958 --> 00:09:22.958\nthis may seem a little incongruous.\n\n00:09:22.958 --> 00:09:24.958\nThis is a scene or snippet\n\n00:09:24.958 --> 00:09:27.958\nfrom the Truth and Reconciliation process in South Africa\n\n00:09:27.958 --> 00:09:30.958\nfor which Desmond Tutu won the Nobel Prize.\n\n00:09:30.958 --> 00:09:32.958\nNow think about that. South Africa,\n\n00:09:32.958 --> 00:09:35.958\nterrible atrocities had happened in the society.\n\n00:09:35.958 --> 00:09:37.958\nAnd people came together\n\n00:09:37.958 --> 00:09:41.958\nfocused only on those two values: truth and reconciliation.\n\n00:09:41.958 --> 00:09:43.958\nThere was no road map. No one had ever done\n\n00:09:43.958 --> 00:09:45.958\nanything like this before.\n\n00:09:45.958 --> 00:09:48.958\nAnd in this atmosphere, where the only guidance\n\n00:09:48.958 --> 00:09:51.958\nwas people's values and their noble cause,\n\n00:09:51.958 --> 00:09:54.958\nwhat this group accomplished was historic.\n\n00:09:54.958 --> 00:09:57.958\nAnd people, at the time, feared that South Africa\n\n00:09:57.958 --> 00:09:59.958\nwould end up going the way that Rwanda has gone,\n\n00:09:59.958 --> 00:10:02.958\ndescending into one skirmish after another\n\n00:10:02.958 --> 00:10:04.958\nin a civil war that seems to have no end.\n\n00:10:04.958 --> 00:10:07.958\nIn fact, South Africa has not gone down that road.\n\n00:10:07.958 --> 00:10:10.958\nLargely because people like Desmond Tutu\n\n00:10:10.958 --> 00:10:13.958\nset up a Stage Five process\n\n00:10:13.958 --> 00:10:15.958\nto involve the thousands and perhaps millions\n\n00:10:15.958 --> 00:10:18.958\nof tribes in the country, to bring everyone together.\n\n00:10:18.958 --> 00:10:21.958\nSo, people hear this and they conclude the following,\n\n00:10:21.958 --> 00:10:23.958\nas did we in doing the study.\n\n00:10:23.958 --> 00:10:26.958\nOkay, got it. I don't want to talk Stage One.\n\n00:10:26.958 --> 00:10:28.958\nThat's like, you know, \"Life sucks.\" Who wants to talk that way?\n\n00:10:28.958 --> 00:10:30.958\nI don't want to talk like they do\n\n00:10:30.958 --> 00:10:32.958\nat the particular DMV that's close to where Dave lives.\n\n00:10:32.958 --> 00:10:34.958\nI really don't want to just say \"I'm great,\"\n\n00:10:34.958 --> 00:10:37.958\nbecause that kind of sounds narcissistic, and then I won't have any friends.\n\n00:10:37.958 --> 00:10:39.958\nSaying, \"We're great\" -- that sounds pretty good.\n\n00:10:39.958 --> 00:10:43.958\nBut I should really talk Stage Five, right? \"Life is great.\"\n\n00:10:43.958 --> 00:10:47.958\nWell, in fact, there are three somewhat counter-intuitive findings\n\n00:10:47.958 --> 00:10:49.958\nthat come out of all this.\n\n00:10:49.958 --> 00:10:51.958\nThe first one, if you look at the Declaration of Independence\n\n00:10:51.958 --> 00:10:53.958\nand actually read it,\n\n00:10:53.958 --> 00:10:55.958\nthe phrase that sticks in many of our minds\n\n00:10:55.958 --> 00:10:58.958\nis things about inalienable rights.\n\n00:10:58.958 --> 00:11:00.958\nI mean, that's Stage Five, right? Life is great,\n\n00:11:00.958 --> 00:11:02.958\noriented only by our values,\n\n00:11:02.958 --> 00:11:04.958\nno other guidance.\n\n00:11:04.958 --> 00:11:07.958\nIn fact, most of the document is written at Stage Two.\n\n00:11:07.958 --> 00:11:10.958\n\"My life sucks because I live under a tyrant,\n\n00:11:10.958 --> 00:11:12.958\nalso known as King George.\n\n00:11:12.958 --> 00:11:14.958\nWe're great! Who is not great? England!\"\n\n00:11:14.958 --> 00:11:18.958\nSorry. (Laughter)\n\n00:11:18.958 --> 00:11:20.958\nWell, what about other great leaders? What about Gandhi?\n\n00:11:20.958 --> 00:11:22.958\nWhat about Martin Luther King?\n\n00:11:22.958 --> 00:11:24.958\nI mean, surely these were just people who preached, \"Life is great,\" right?\n\n00:11:24.958 --> 00:11:28.958\nJust one little bit of happiness and joy after another.\n\n00:11:28.958 --> 00:11:32.958\nIn fact, Martin Luther King's most famous line was at Stage Three.\n\n00:11:32.958 --> 00:11:35.958\nHe didn't say \"We have a dream.\" He said, \"I have a dream.\"\n\n00:11:35.958 --> 00:11:37.958\nWhy did he do that? Because most people\n\n00:11:37.958 --> 00:11:39.958\nare not at Stage Five.\n\n00:11:39.958 --> 00:11:41.958\nTwo percent are at Stage One.\n\n00:11:41.958 --> 00:11:45.958\nAbout 25 percent are at Stage Two,\n\n00:11:45.958 --> 00:11:48.958\nsaying, in effect, \"My life sucks.\"\n\n00:11:48.958 --> 00:11:53.958\n48 percent of working tribes say, these are employed tribes,\n\n00:11:53.958 --> 00:11:55.958\nsay, \"I'm great and you're not.\"\n\n00:11:55.958 --> 00:11:58.958\nAnd we have to duke it out every day, so we resort to politics.\n\n00:11:58.958 --> 00:12:00.958\nOnly about 22 percent of tribes\n\n00:12:00.958 --> 00:12:02.958\nare at Stage Four,\n\n00:12:02.958 --> 00:12:04.958\noriented by our values, saying \"We're great.\n\n00:12:04.958 --> 00:12:06.958\nAnd our values are beginning to unite us.\"\n\n00:12:06.958 --> 00:12:09.958\nOnly two percent, only two percent of tribes\n\n00:12:09.958 --> 00:12:11.958\nget to Stage Five.\n\n00:12:11.958 --> 00:12:13.958\nAnd those are the ones that change the world.\n\n00:12:13.958 --> 00:12:15.958\nSo the first little finding from this\n\n00:12:15.958 --> 00:12:18.958\nis that leaders need to be able to talk all the levels\n\n00:12:18.958 --> 00:12:21.958\nso that you can touch every person in society.\n\n00:12:21.958 --> 00:12:24.958\nBut you don't leave them where you found them. Okay?\n\n00:12:24.958 --> 00:12:28.958\nTribes can only hear one level above and below where they are.\n\n00:12:28.958 --> 00:12:30.958\nSo we have to have the ability to talk\n\n00:12:30.958 --> 00:12:32.958\nall the levels, to go to where they are.\n\n00:12:32.958 --> 00:12:34.958\nAnd then leaders nudge people\n\n00:12:34.958 --> 00:12:36.958\nwithin their tribes to the next level.\n\n00:12:36.958 --> 00:12:38.958\nI'd like to show you some examples of this.\n\n00:12:38.958 --> 00:12:41.958\nOne of the people we interviewed was Frank Jordan,\n\n00:12:41.958 --> 00:12:43.958\nformer Mayor of San Francisco. Before that\n\n00:12:43.958 --> 00:12:45.958\nhe was Chief of Police in San Francisco.\n\n00:12:45.958 --> 00:12:48.958\nAnd he grew up essentially in Stage One.\n\n00:12:48.958 --> 00:12:50.958\nAnd you know what changed his life? It was walking into\n\n00:12:50.958 --> 00:12:52.958\none of these, a Boys and Girls Club.\n\n00:12:52.958 --> 00:12:55.958\nNow here is what happened to this person\n\n00:12:55.958 --> 00:12:57.958\nwho eventually became Mayor of San Francisco.\n\n00:12:57.958 --> 00:12:59.958\nHe went from being alive and passionate\n\n00:12:59.958 --> 00:13:01.958\nat Stage One -- remember, \"Life sucks,\n\n00:13:01.958 --> 00:13:05.958\ndespairing hostility, I will do whatever it takes to survive\" --\n\n00:13:05.958 --> 00:13:07.958\nto walking into a Boys and Girls Club,\n\n00:13:07.958 --> 00:13:09.958\nfolding his arms, sitting down in a chair,\n\n00:13:09.958 --> 00:13:11.958\nand saying, \"Wow. My life really sucks.\n\n00:13:11.958 --> 00:13:13.958\nI don't know anybody.\n\n00:13:13.958 --> 00:13:15.958\nI mean, if I was into boxing, like they were,\n\n00:13:15.958 --> 00:13:17.958\nthen my life wouldn't suck. But I don't. So it does.\n\n00:13:17.958 --> 00:13:19.958\nSo I'm going to sit here in my chair and not do anything.\"\n\n00:13:19.958 --> 00:13:21.958\nIn fact, that's progress.\n\n00:13:21.958 --> 00:13:24.958\nWe move people from Stage One to Stage Two\n\n00:13:24.958 --> 00:13:26.958\nby getting them in a new tribe\n\n00:13:26.958 --> 00:13:29.958\nand then, over time, getting them connected.\n\n00:13:29.958 --> 00:13:31.958\nSo, what about moving\n\n00:13:31.958 --> 00:13:33.958\nfrom Stage Three to Stage Four?\n\n00:13:33.958 --> 00:13:36.958\nI want to argue that we're doing that right here.\n\n00:13:36.958 --> 00:13:39.958\nTED represents a set of values,\n\n00:13:39.958 --> 00:13:42.958\nand as we unite around these values,\n\n00:13:42.958 --> 00:13:44.958\nsomething really interesting begins to emerge.\n\n00:13:44.958 --> 00:13:47.958\nIf you want this experience to live on\n\n00:13:47.958 --> 00:13:49.958\nas something historic,\n\n00:13:49.958 --> 00:13:52.958\nthen at the reception tonight I'd like to encourage you to do something\n\n00:13:52.958 --> 00:13:54.958\nbeyond what people normally do\n\n00:13:54.958 --> 00:13:56.958\nand call networking.\n\n00:13:56.958 --> 00:13:58.958\nWhich is not just to meet new people\n\n00:13:58.958 --> 00:14:01.958\nand extend your reach, extend your influence,\n\n00:14:01.958 --> 00:14:03.958\nbut instead, find someone you don't know,\n\n00:14:03.958 --> 00:14:05.958\nand find someone else you don't know,\n\n00:14:05.958 --> 00:14:07.958\nand introduce them.\n\n00:14:07.958 --> 00:14:10.958\nThat's called a triadic relationship.\n\n00:14:10.958 --> 00:14:14.958\nSee, people who build world-changing tribes do that.\n\n00:14:14.958 --> 00:14:17.958\nThey extend the reach of their tribes\n\n00:14:17.958 --> 00:14:19.958\nby connecting them, not just to myself,\n\n00:14:19.958 --> 00:14:21.958\nso that my following is greater,\n\n00:14:21.958 --> 00:14:23.958\nbut I connect people who don't know each other\n\n00:14:23.958 --> 00:14:25.958\nto something greater than themselves.\n\n00:14:25.958 --> 00:14:28.958\nAnd ultimately that adds to their values.\n\n00:14:28.958 --> 00:14:32.958\nBut we're not done yet. Because then how do we go from Stage Four,\n\n00:14:32.958 --> 00:14:35.958\nwhich is great, to Stage Five?\n\n00:14:35.958 --> 00:14:37.958\nThe story that I like to end with is this. It comes out of\n\n00:14:37.958 --> 00:14:39.958\na place called the Gallup Organization.\n\n00:14:39.958 --> 00:14:41.958\nYou know they do polls, right?\n\n00:14:41.958 --> 00:14:43.958\nSo it's Stage Four. We're great. Who is not great?\n\n00:14:43.958 --> 00:14:46.958\nPretty much everybody else who does polls.\n\n00:14:46.958 --> 00:14:49.958\nIf Gallup releases a poll on the same day that NBC releases a poll,\n\n00:14:49.958 --> 00:14:52.958\npeople will pay attention to the Gallup poll. Okay, we understand that.\n\n00:14:52.958 --> 00:14:54.958\nSo, they were bored.\n\n00:14:54.958 --> 00:14:57.958\nThey wanted to change the world. So here is the question someone asked.\n\n00:14:57.958 --> 00:14:59.958\n\"How could we,\n\n00:14:59.958 --> 00:15:01.958\ninstead of just polling what Asia thinks\n\n00:15:01.958 --> 00:15:03.958\nor what the United States thinks,\n\n00:15:03.958 --> 00:15:05.958\nor who thinks what about Obama\n\n00:15:05.958 --> 00:15:07.958\nversus McCain or something like that,\n\n00:15:07.958 --> 00:15:11.958\nwhat does the entire world think?\"\n\n00:15:11.958 --> 00:15:15.958\nAnd they found a way to do the first-ever world poll.\n\n00:15:15.958 --> 00:15:17.958\nThey had people involved who were Nobel laureates\n\n00:15:17.958 --> 00:15:19.958\nin economics, who reported being bored.\n\n00:15:19.958 --> 00:15:21.958\nAnd suddenly they pulled out sheets of paper\n\n00:15:21.958 --> 00:15:24.958\nand were trying to figure out, \"How do we survey the population\n\n00:15:24.958 --> 00:15:26.958\nof Sub-Saharan Africa?\n\n00:15:26.958 --> 00:15:29.958\nHow do we survey populations that don't have access to technology,\n\n00:15:29.958 --> 00:15:31.958\nand speak languages we don't speak,\n\n00:15:31.958 --> 00:15:33.958\nand we don't know anyone who speaks those languages. Because in order\n\n00:15:33.958 --> 00:15:36.958\nto achieve on this great mission,\n\n00:15:36.958 --> 00:15:38.958\nwe have to be able to do it.\n\n00:15:38.958 --> 00:15:40.958\nIncidentally, they did pull it off.\n\n00:15:40.958 --> 00:15:43.958\nAnd they released the first-ever world poll.\n\n00:15:43.958 --> 00:15:45.958\nSo I'd like to leave you with these thoughts.\n\n00:15:45.958 --> 00:15:48.958\nFirst of all: we all form tribes, all of us.\n\n00:15:48.958 --> 00:15:50.958\nYou're in tribes here. Hopefully you're extending the reach\n\n00:15:50.958 --> 00:15:52.958\nof the tribes that you have.\n\n00:15:52.958 --> 00:15:55.958\nBut the question on the table is this:\n\n00:15:55.958 --> 00:15:57.958\nWhat kind of an impact are the tribes\n\n00:15:57.958 --> 00:15:59.958\nthat you are in making?\n\n00:15:59.958 --> 00:16:02.958\nYou're hearing one presentation after another,\n\n00:16:02.958 --> 00:16:04.958\noften representing a group of people, a tribe,\n\n00:16:04.958 --> 00:16:07.958\nabout how they have changed the world.\n\n00:16:07.958 --> 00:16:09.958\nIf you do what we've talked about, you listen\n\n00:16:09.958 --> 00:16:12.958\nfor how people actually communicate in the tribes that you're in.\n\n00:16:12.958 --> 00:16:15.958\nAnd you don't leave them where they are. You nudge them forward.\n\n00:16:15.958 --> 00:16:18.958\nYou remember to talk all five culture stages.\n\n00:16:18.958 --> 00:16:21.958\nBecause we've got people in all five, around us.\n\n00:16:21.958 --> 00:16:24.958\nAnd the question that I'd like to leave you with is this:\n\n00:16:24.958 --> 00:16:26.958\nWill your tribes change the world?\n\n00:16:26.958 --> 00:16:28.958\nThank you very much.\n\n00:16:28.958 --> 00:16:30.958\n(Applause)"}, {"title": "The danger of a single story", "duration": "1129", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/chimamanda_adichie_the_danger_of_a_single_story", "transcript": "I'm a storyteller. And I would like to tell you a few personal stories about what I like to call \"the danger of the single story.\" I grew up on a university campus in eastern Nigeria. My mother says that I started reading at the age of two, although I think four is probably close to the truth. So I was an early reader, and what I read were British and American children's books.I was also an early writer, and when I began to write, at about the age of seven, stories in pencil with crayon illustrations that my poor mother was obligated to read, I wrote exactly the kinds of stories I was reading: All my characters were white and blue-eyed, they played in the snow, they ate apples,(Laughter)and they talked a lot about the weather, how lovely it was that the sun had come out.(Laughter)Now, this despite the fact that I lived in Nigeria. I had never been outside Nigeria. We didn't have snow, we ate mangoes, and we never talked about the weather, because there was no need to.My characters also drank a lot of ginger beer, because the characters in the British books I read drank ginger beer. Never mind that I had no idea what ginger beer was.(Laughter)And for many years afterwards, I would have a desperate desire to taste ginger beer. But that is another story.What this demonstrates, I think, is how impressionable and vulnerable we are in the face of a story, particularly as children. Because all I had read were books in which characters were foreign, I had become convinced that books by their very nature had to have foreigners in them and had to be about things with which I could not personally identify. Now, things changed when I discovered African books. There weren't many of them available, and they weren't quite as easy to find as the foreign books.But because of writers like Chinua Achebe and Camara Laye, I went through a mental shift in my perception of literature. I realized that people like me, girls with skin the color of chocolate, whose kinky hair could not form ponytails, could also exist in literature. I started to write about things I recognized.Now, I loved those American and British books I read. They stirred my imagination. They opened up new worlds for me. But the unintended consequence was that I did not know that people like me could exist in literature. So what the discovery of African writers did for me was this: It saved me from having a single story of what books are.I come from a conventional, middle-class Nigerian family. My father was a professor. My mother was an administrator. And so we had, as was the norm, live-in domestic help, who would often come from nearby rural villages. So, the year I turned eight, we got a new house boy. His name was Fide. The only thing my mother told us about him was that his family was very poor. My mother sent yams and rice, and our old clothes, to his family. And when I didn't finish my dinner, my mother would say, \"Finish your food! Don't you know? People like Fide's family have nothing.\" So I felt enormous pity for Fide's family.Then one Saturday, we went to his village to visit, and his mother showed us a beautifully patterned basket made of dyed raffia that his brother had made. I was startled. It had not occurred to me that anybody in his family could actually make something. All I had heard about them was how poor they were, so that it had become impossible for me to see them as anything else but poor. Their poverty was my single story of them.Years later, I thought about this when I left Nigeria to go to university in the United States. I was 19. My American roommate was shocked by me. She asked where I had learned to speak English so well, and was confused when I said that Nigeria happened to have English as its official language. She asked if she could listen to what she called my \"tribal music,\" and was consequently very disappointed when I produced my tape of Mariah Carey.(Laughter)She assumed that I did not know how to use a stove.What struck me was this: She had felt sorry for me even before she saw me. Her default position toward me, as an African, was a kind of patronizing, well-meaning pity. My roommate had a single story of Africa: a single story of catastrophe. In this single story, there was no possibility of Africans being similar to her in any way, no possibility of feelings more complex than pity, no possibility of a connection as human equals.I must say that before I went to the U.S., I didn't consciously identify as African. But in the U.S., whenever Africa came up, people turned to me. Never mind that I knew nothing about places like Namibia. But I did come to embrace this new identity, and in many ways I think of myself now as African. Although I still get quite irritable when Africa is referred to as a country, the most recent example being my otherwise wonderful flight from Lagos two days ago, in which there was an announcement on the Virgin flight about the charity work in \"India, Africa and other countries.\"(Laughter)So, after I had spent some years in the U.S. as an African, I began to understand my roommate's response to me. If I had not grown up in Nigeria, and if all I knew about Africa were from popular images, I too would think that Africa was a place of beautiful landscapes, beautiful animals, and incomprehensible people, fighting senseless wars, dying of poverty and AIDS, unable to speak for themselves and waiting to be saved by a kind, white foreigner. I would see Africans in the same way that I, as a child, had seen Fide's family.This single story of Africa ultimately comes, I think, from Western literature. Now, here is a quote from the writing of a London merchant called John Lok, who sailed to west Africa in 1561 and kept a fascinating account of his voyage. After referring to the black Africans as \"beasts who have no houses,\" he writes, \"They are also people without heads, having their mouth and eyes in their breasts.\"Now, I've laughed every time I've read this. And one must admire the imagination of John Lok. But what is important about his writing is that it represents the beginning of a tradition of telling African stories in the West: A tradition of Sub-Saharan Africa as a place of negatives, of difference, of darkness, of people who, in the words of the wonderful poet Rudyard Kipling, are \"half devil, half child.\"And so, I began to realize that my American roommate must have throughout her life seen and heard different versions of this single story, as had a professor, who once told me that my novel was not \"authentically African.\" Now, I was quite willing to contend that there were a number of things wrong with the novel, that it had failed in a number of places, but I had not quite imagined that it had failed at achieving something called African authenticity. In fact, I did not know what African authenticity was. The professor told me that my characters were too much like him, an educated and middle-class man. My characters drove cars. They were not starving. Therefore they were not authentically African.But I must quickly add that I too am just as guilty in the question of the single story. A few years ago, I visited Mexico from the U.S. The political climate in the U.S. at the time was tense, and there were debates going on about immigration. And, as often happens in America, immigration became synonymous with Mexicans. There were endless stories of Mexicans as people who were fleecing the healthcare system, sneaking across the border, being arrested at the border, that sort of thing.I remember walking around on my first day in Guadalajara, watching the people going to work, rolling up tortillas in the marketplace, smoking, laughing. I remember first feeling slight surprise. And then, I was overwhelmed with shame. I realized that I had been so immersed in the media coverage of Mexicans that they had become one thing in my mind, the abject immigrant. I had bought into the single story of Mexicans and I could not have been more ashamed of myself.So that is how to create a single story, show a people as one thing, as only one thing, over and over again, and that is what they become.It is impossible to talk about the single story without talking about power. There is a word, an Igbo word, that I think about whenever I think about the power structures of the world, and it is \"nkali.\" It's a noun that loosely translates to \"to be greater than another.\" Like our economic and political worlds, stories too are defined by the principle of nkali: How they are told, who tells them, when they're told, how many stories are told, are really dependent on power.Power is the ability not just to tell the story of another person, but to make it the definitive story of that person. The Palestinian poet Mourid Barghouti writes that if you want to dispossess a people, the simplest way to do it is to tell their story and to start with, \"secondly.\" Start the story with the arrows of the Native Americans, and not with the arrival of the British, and you have an entirely different story. Start the story with the failure of the African state, and not with the colonial creation of the African state, and you have an entirely different story.I recently spoke at a university where a student told me that it was such a shame that Nigerian men were physical abusers like the father character in my novel. I told him that I had just read a novel called \"American Psycho\" \u2014(Laughter)\u2014 and that it was such a shame that young Americans were serial murderers.(Laughter)(Applause)Now, obviously I said this in a fit of mild irritation.(Laughter)But it would never have occurred to me to think that just because I had read a novel in which a character was a serial killer that he was somehow representative of all Americans. This is not because I am a better person than that student, but because of America's cultural and economic power, I had many stories of America. I had read Tyler and Updike and Steinbeck and Gaitskill. I did not have a single story of America.When I learned, some years ago, that writers were expected to have had really unhappy childhoods to be successful, I began to think about how I could invent horrible things my parents had done to me.(Laughter)But the truth is that I had a very happy childhood, full of laughter and love, in a very close-knit family.But I also had grandfathers who died in refugee camps. My cousin Polle died because he could not get adequate healthcare. One of my closest friends, Okoloma, died in a plane crash because our fire trucks did not have water. I grew up under repressive military governments that devalued education, so that sometimes, my parents were not paid their salaries. And so, as a child, I saw jam disappear from the breakfast table, then margarine disappeared, then bread became too expensive, then milk became rationed. And most of all, a kind of normalized political fear invaded our lives.All of these stories make me who I am. But to insist on only these negative stories is to flatten my experience and to overlook the many other stories that formed me. The single story creates stereotypes, and the problem with stereotypes is not that they are untrue, but that they are incomplete. They make one story become the only story.Of course, Africa is a continent full of catastrophes: There are immense ones, such as the horrific rapes in Congo and depressing ones, such as the fact that 5,000 people apply for one job vacancy in Nigeria. But there are other stories that are not about catastrophe, and it is very important, it is just as important, to talk about them.I've always felt that it is impossible to engage properly with a place or a person without engaging with all of the stories of that place and that person. The consequence of the single story is this: It robs people of dignity. It makes our recognition of our equal humanity difficult. It emphasizes how we are different rather than how we are similar.So what if before my Mexican trip, I had followed the immigration debate from both sides, the U.S. and the Mexican? What if my mother had told us that Fide's family was poor and hardworking? What if we had an African television network that broadcast diverse African stories all over the world? What the Nigerian writer Chinua Achebe calls \"a balance of stories.\"What if my roommate knew about my Nigerian publisher, Muhtar Bakare, a remarkable man who left his job in a bank to follow his dream and start a publishing house? Now, the conventional wisdom was that Nigerians don't read literature. He disagreed. He felt that people who could read, would read, if you made literature affordable and available to them.Shortly after he published my first novel, I went to a TV station in Lagos to do an interview, and a woman who worked there as a messenger came up to me and said, \"I really liked your novel. I didn't like the ending. Now, you must write a sequel, and this is what will happen ...\"(Laughter)And she went on to tell me what to write in the sequel. I was not only charmed, I was very moved. Here was a woman, part of the ordinary masses of Nigerians, who were not supposed to be readers. She had not only read the book, but she had taken ownership of it and felt justified in telling me what to write in the sequel.Now, what if my roommate knew about my friend Funmi Iyanda, a fearless woman who hosts a TV show in Lagos, and is determined to tell the stories that we prefer to forget? What if my roommate knew about the heart procedure that was performed in the Lagos hospital last week? What if my roommate knew about contemporary Nigerian music, talented people singing in English and Pidgin, and Igbo and Yoruba and Ijo, mixing influences from Jay-Z to Fela to Bob Marley to their grandfathers.What if my roommate knew about the female lawyer who recently went to court in Nigeria to challenge a ridiculous law that required women to get their husband's consent before renewing their passports? What if my roommate knew about Nollywood, full of innovative people making films despite great technical odds, films so popular that they really are the best example of Nigerians consuming what they produce? What if my roommate knew about my wonderfully ambitious hair braider, who has just started her own business selling hair extensions? Or about the millions of other Nigerians who start businesses and sometimes fail, but continue to nurse ambition?Every time I am home I am confronted with the usual sources of irritation for most Nigerians: our failed infrastructure, our failed government, but also by the incredible resilience of people who thrive despite the government, rather than because of it. I teach writing workshops in Lagos every summer, and it is amazing to me how many people apply, how many people are eager to write, to tell stories.My Nigerian publisher and I have just started a non-profit called Farafina Trust, and we have big dreams of building libraries and refurbishing libraries that already exist and providing books for state schools that don't have anything in their libraries, and also of organizing lots and lots of workshops, in reading and writing, for all the people who are eager to tell our many stories.Stories matter. Many stories matter. Stories have been used to dispossess and to malign, but stories can also be used to empower and to humanize. Stories can break the dignity of a people, but stories can also repair that broken dignity.The American writer Alice Walker wrote this about her Southern relatives who had moved to the North. She introduced them to a book about the Southern life that they had left behind. \"They sat around, reading the book themselves, listening to me read the book, and a kind of paradise was regained.\"I would like to end with this thought: That when we reject the single story, when we realize that there is never a single story about any place, we regain a kind of paradise.Thank you.(Applause)", "id":

disappointed\n\n00:04:39.958 --> 00:04:41.934\nwhen I produced my tape of Mariah Carey.\n\n00:04:41.958 --> 00:04:44.934\n(Laughter)\n\n00:04:44.958 --> 00:04:48.651\nShe assumed that I did not know\nhow to use a stove.\n\n00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:50.996\nWhat struck me was this:\n\n00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:54.095\nShe had felt sorry for me\neven before she saw me.\n\n00:04:54.486 --> 00:04:57.934\nHer default position\ntoward me, as an African,\n\n00:04:57.958 --> 00:05:00.994\nwas a kind of patronizing,\nwell-meaning pity.\n\n00:05:01.958 --> 00:05:05.454\nMy roommate had a single story of Africa:\n\n00:05:05.581 --> 00:05:07.935\na single story of catastrophe.\n\n00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:09.656\nIn this single story,\n\n00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:13.934\nthere was no possibility of Africans\nbeing similar to her in any way,\n\n00:05:13.958 --> 00:05:16.934\nno possibility of feelings\nmore complex than pity,\n\n00:05:16.958 --> 00:05:20.934\nno possibility of a connection\nas human equals.\n\n00:05:20.958 --> 00:05:23.081\nI must say that before I went to the U.S.,\n\n00:05:23.105 --> 00:05:25.386\nI didn't consciously identify as African.\n\n00:05:25.958 --> 00:05:28.934\nBut in the U.S., whenever Africa came up,\npeople turned to me.\n\n00:05:28.958 --> 00:05:31.704\nNever mind that I knew nothing\nabout places like Namibia.\n\n00:05:32.958 --> 00:05:35.054\nBut I did come to embrace\nthis new identity,\n\n00:05:35.078 --> 00:05:37.934\nand in many ways I think\nof myself now as African.\n\n00:05:37.958 --> 00:05:41.934\nAlthough I still get quite irritable\nwhen Africa is referred to as a country,\n\n00:05:41.958 --> 00:05:45.934\nthe most recent example being\nmy otherwise wonderful flight\n\n00:05:45.958 --> 00:05:47.243\nfrom Lagos two days ago,\n\n00:05:47.267 --> 00:05:50.149\nin which there was an announcement\non the Virgin flight\n\n00:05:50.173 --> 00:05:54.934\nabout the charity work in \"India,\nAfrica and other countries.\"\n\n00:05:54.958 --> 00:05:56.275\n(Laughter)\n\n00:05:56.434 --> 00:05:59.934\nSo, after I had spent some years\nin the U.S. as an African,\n\n00:05:59.958 --> 00:06:03.132\nI began to understand\nmy roommate's response to me.\n\n00:06:03.958 --> 00:06:05.983\nIf I had not grown up in Nigeria,\n\n00:06:06.007 --> 00:06:09.148\nand if all I knew about Africa\nwere from popular images,\n\n00:06:09.172 --> 00:06:14.344\nI too would think that Africa\nwas a place of beautiful landscapes,\n\n00:06:14.368 --> 00:06:15.934\nbeautiful animals,\n\n00:06:15.958 --> 00:06:17.934\nand incomprehensible people,\n\n00:06:17.958 --> 00:06:21.589\nfighting senseless wars,\ndying of poverty and AIDS,\n\n00:06:21.613 --> 00:06:23.934\nunable to speak for themselves\n\n00:06:23.958 --> 00:06:28.113\nand waiting to be saved\nby a kind, white foreigner.\n\n00:06:28.886 --> 00:06:31.055\nI would see Africans\nin the same way that I,\n\n00:06:31.079 --> 00:06:33.782\nas a child, had seen Fide's family.\n\n00:06:34.958 --> 00:06:38.934\nThis single story of Africa ultimately\ncomes, I think, from Western literature.\n\n00:06:38.958 --> 00:06:43.934\nNow, here is a quote from the writing\nof a London merchant called John Lok,\n\n00:06:43.958 --> 00:06:46.934\nwho sailed to west Africa in 1561\n\n00:06:46.958 --> 00:06:50.621\nand kept a fascinating\naccount of his voyage.\n\n00:06:52.161 --> 00:06:55.934\nAfter referring to the black Africans\nas \"beasts who have no houses,\"\n\n00:06:55.958 --> 00:06:59.934\nhe writes, \"They are also\npeople without heads,\n\n00:06:59.958 --> 00:07:03.926\nhaving their mouth and eyes\nin their breasts.\"\n\n00:07:04.958 --> 00:07:07.054\nNow, I've laughed\nevery time I've read this.\n\n00:07:07.078 --> 00:07:10.458\nAnd one must admire\nthe imagination of John Lok.\n\n00:07:11.331 --> 00:07:13.197\nBut what is important about his writing\n\n00:07:13.221 --> 00:07:14.934\nis that it represents the beginning\n\n00:07:14.958 --> 00:07:17.934\nof a tradition of telling\nAfrican stories in the West:\n\n00:07:17.958 --> 00:07:21.325\nA tradition of Sub-Saharan Africa\nas a place of negatives,\n\n00:07:21.437 --> 00:07:23.592\nof difference, of darkness,\n\n00:07:23.616 --> 00:07:28.934\nof people who, in the words\nof the wonderful poet Rudyard Kipling,\n\n00:07:28.958 --> 00:07:30.899\nare \"half devil, half child.\"\n\n00:07:32.169 --> 00:07:34.934\nAnd so, I began to realize\nthat my American roommate\n\n00:07:34.958 --> 00:07:36.934\nmust have throughout her life\n\n00:07:36.958 --> 00:07:40.934\nseen and heard different versions\nof this single story,\n\n00:07:40.958 --> 00:07:42.934\nas had a professor,\n\n00:07:42.958 --> 00:07:46.724\nwho once told me that my novel\nwas not \"authentically African.\"\n\n00:07:47.827 --> 00:07:49.518\nNow, I was quite willing to contend\n\n00:07:49.542 --> 00:07:52.637\nthat there were a number of things\nwrong with the novel,\n\n00:07:52.661 --> 00:07:55.934\nthat it had failed in a number of places,\n\n00:07:55.958 --> 00:07:58.197\nbut I had not quite imagined\nthat it had failed\n\n00:07:58.221 --> 00:08:00.934\nat achieving something\ncalled African authenticity.\n\n00:08:00.958 --> 00:08:04.664\nIn fact, I did not know\nwhat African authenticity was.\n\n00:08:05.958 --> 00:08:10.354\nThe professor told me that my characters\nwere too much like him,\n\n00:08:10.378 --> 00:08:12.354\nan educated and middle-class man.\n\n00:08:12.378 --> 00:08:14.480\nMy characters drove cars.\n\n00:08:14.504 --> 00:08:16.934\nThey were not starving.\n\n00:08:16.958 --> 00:08:19.885\nTherefore they were not\nauthentically African.\n\n00:08:20.958 --> 00:08:23.934\nBut I must quickly add\nthat I too am just as guilty\n\n00:08:23.958 --> 00:08:26.028\nin the question of the single story.\n\n00:08:26.958 --> 00:08:29.949\nA few years ago,\nI visited Mexico from the U.S.\n\n00:08:30.958 --> 00:08:33.625\nThe political climate in the U.S.\nat the time was tense,\n\n00:08:33.649 --> 00:08:36.934\nand there were debates going on\nabout immigration.\n\n00:08:36.958 --> 00:08:38.934\nAnd, as often happens in America,\n\n00:08:38.958 --> 00:08:41.934\nimmigration became\nsynonymous with Mexicans.\n\n00:08:42.656 --> 00:08:44.589\nThere were endless stories of Mexicans\n\n00:08:44.613 --> 00:08:47.934\nas people who were\nfleecing the healthcare system,\n\n00:08:47.958 --> 00:08:49.934\nsneaking across the border,\n\n00:08:49.958 --> 00:08:52.423\nbeing arrested at the border,\nthat sort of thing.\n\n00:08:54.121 --> 00:08:57.934\nI remember walking around\non my first day in Guadalajara,\n\n00:08:57.958 --> 00:08:59.934\nwatching the people going to work,\n\n00:08:59.958 --> 00:09:01.934\nrolling up tortillas in the marketplace,\n\n00:09:01.958 --> 00:09:03.931\nsmoking, laughing.\n\n00:09:05.153 --> 00:09:07.934\nI remember first feeling slight surprise.\n\n00:09:07.958 --> 00:09:10.934\nAnd then, I was overwhelmed with shame.\n\n00:09:11.299 --> 00:09:15.934\nI realized that I had been so immersed\nin the media coverage of Mexicans\n\n00:09:15.958 --> 00:09:17.958\nthat they had become one thing in my mind,\n\n00:09:17.982 --> 00:09:19.807\nthe abject immigrant.\n\n00:09:20.727 --> 00:09:23.149\nI had bought into\nthe single story of Mexicans\n\n00:09:23.173 --> 00:09:25.680\nand I could not have\nbeen more ashamed of myself.\n\n00:09:26.029 --> 00:09:28.576\nSo that is how to create a single story,\n\n00:09:28.600 --> 00:09:30.934\nshow a people as one thing,\n\n00:09:30.958 --> 00:09:32.934\nas only one thing,\n\n00:09:32.958 --> 00:09:34.934\nover and over again,\n\n00:09:34.958 --> 00:09:36.473\nand that is what they become.\n\n00:09:37.751 --> 00:09:40.197\nIt is impossible to talk\nabout the single story\n\n00:09:40.221 --> 00:09:41.910\nwithout talking about power.\n\n00:09:43.454 --> 00:09:45.202\nThere is a word, an Igbo word,\n\n00:09:45.226 --> 00:09:48.877\nthat I think about whenever I think about\nthe power structures of the world,\n\n00:09:48.901 --> 00:09:50.091\nand it is \"nkali.\"\n\n00:09:50.290 --> 00:09:54.934\nIt's a noun that loosely translates\nto \"to be greater than another.\"\n\n00:09:55.512 --> 00:09:58.440\nLike our economic and political worlds,\n\n00:09:58.464 --> 00:10:02.934\nstories too are defined\nby the principle of nkali:\n\n00:10:02.958 --> 00:10:04.934\nHow they are told, who tells them,\n\n00:10:04.958 --> 00:10:08.195\nwhen they're told,\nhow many stories are told,\n\n00:10:08.219 --> 00:10:10.426\nare really dependent on power.\n\n00:10:11.958 --> 00:10:15.101\nPower is the ability not just to tell\nthe story of another person,\n\n00:10:15.125 --> 00:10:18.934\nbut to make it the definitive\nstory of that person.\n\n00:10:18.958 --> 00:10:21.054\nThe Palestinian poet\nMourid Barghouti writes\n\n00:10:21.078 --> 00:10:23.934\nthat if you want to dispossess a people,\n\n00:10:23.958 --> 00:10:26.934\nthe simplest way to do it\nis to tell their story\n\n00:10:26.958 --> 00:10:29.188\nand to start with, \"secondly.\"\n\n00:10:30.442 --> 00:10:34.340\nStart the story with the arrows\nof the Native Americans,\n\n00:10:34.364 --> 00:10:36.934\nand not with the arrival of the British,\n\n00:10:36.958 --> 00:10:39.935\nand you have an entirely different story.\n\n00:10:39.959 --> 00:10:44.391\nStart the story with\nthe failure of the African state,\n\n00:10:44.415 --> 00:10:47.934\nand not with the colonial\ncreation of the African state,\n\n00:10:47.958 --> 00:10:50.700\nand you have an entirely different story.\n\n00:10:51.958 --> 00:10:53.934\nI recently spoke at a university\n\n00:10:53.958 --> 00:10:57.743\nwhere a student told me\nthat it was such a shame\n\n00:10:57.767 --> 00:11:00.886\nthat Nigerian men were physical abusers\n\n00:11:00.910 --> 00:11:02.854\nlike the father character in my novel.\n\n00:11:03.958 --> 00:11:07.934\nI told him that I had just read a novel\ncalled \"American Psycho\" --\n\n00:11:07.958 --> 00:11:09.934\n(Laughter)\n\n00:11:09.958 --> 00:11:11.934\n-- and that it was such a shame\n\n00:11:11.958 --> 00:11:14.934\nthat young Americans\nwere serial murderers.\n\n00:11:14.958 --> 00:11:18.934\n(Laughter)\n\n00:11:18.958 --> 00:11:24.934\n(Applause)\n\n00:11:24.958 --> 00:11:27.934\nNow, obviously I said this\nin a fit of mild irritation.\n\n00:11:27.958 --> 00:11:29.934\n(Laughter)\n\n00:11:29.958 --> 00:11:32.149\nBut it would never have\noccurred to me to think\n\n00:11:32.173 --> 00:11:35.934\nthat just because I had read a novel\nin which a character was a serial killer\n\n00:11:35.958 --> 00:11:39.934\nthat he was somehow\nrepresentative of all Americans.\n\n00:11:39.958 --> 00:11:42.934\nThis is not because I am\na better person than that student,\n\n00:11:42.958 --> 00:11:45.934\nbut because of America's cultural\nand economic power,\n\n00:11:45.958 --> 00:11:47.934\nI had many stories of America.\n\n00:11:47.958 --> 00:11:51.934\nI had read Tyler and Updike\nand Steinbeck and Gaitskill.\n\n00:11:51.958 --> 00:11:54.518\nI did not have a single story of America.\n\n00:11:55.629 --> 00:11:57.335\nWhen I learned, some years ago,\n\n00:11:57.359 --> 00:12:01.700\nthat writers were expected\nto have had really unhappy childhoods\n\n00:12:01.724 --> 00:12:03.934\nto be successful,\n\n00:12:03.958 --> 00:12:07.958\nI began to think about how I could invent\nhorrible things my parents had done to me.\n\n00:12:07.982 --> 00:12:09.934\n(Laughter)\n\n00:12:09.958 --> 00:12:13.934\nBut the truth is that I had\na very happy childhood,\n\n00:12:13.958 --> 00:12:16.934\nfull of laughter and love,\nin a very close-knit family.\n\n00:12:16.958 --> 00:12:20.169\nBut I also had grandfathers\nwho died in refugee camps.\n\n00:12:20.708 --> 00:12:24.934\nMy cousin Polle died because\nhe could not get adequate healthcare.\n\n00:12:24.958 --> 00:12:27.934\nOne of my closest friends,\nOkoloma, died in a plane crash\n\n00:12:27.958 --> 00:12:30.934\nbecause our fire trucks\ndid not have water.\n\n00:12:30.958 --> 00:12:33.934\nI grew up under repressive\nmilitary governments\n\n00:12:33.958 --> 00:12:35.934\nthat devalued education,\n\n00:12:35.958 --> 00:12:38.934\nso that sometimes, my parents\nwere not paid their salaries.\n\n00:12:38.958 --> 00:12:42.935\nAnd so, as a child, I saw jam\ndisappear from the breakfast table,\n\n00:12:42.959 --> 00:12:45.456\nthen margarine disappeared,\n\n00:12:45.480 --> 00:12:47.934\nthen bread became too expensive,\n\n00:12:47.958 --> 00:12:49.829\nthen milk became rationed.\n\n00:12:50.958 --> 00:12:54.615\nAnd most of all, a kind\nof normalized political fear\n\n00:12:54.639 --> 00:12:56.321\ninvaded our lives.\n\n00:12:57.781 --> 00:12:59.918\nAll of these stories make me who I am.\n\n00:13:00.415 --> 00:13:03.934\nBut to insist on only\nthese negative stories\n\n00:13:03.958 --> 00:13:06.934\nis to flatten my experience\n\n00:13:06.958 --> 00:13:10.622\nand to overlook the many other\nstories that formed me.\n\n00:13:11.352 --> 00:13:13.934\nThe single story creates stereotypes,\n\n00:13:13.958 --> 00:13:18.934\nand the problem with stereotypes\nis not that they are untrue,\n\n00:13:18.958 --> 00:13:20.934\nbut that they are incomplete.\n\n00:13:21.315 --> 00:13:23.918\nThey make one story become the only story.\n\n00:13:24.958 --> 00:13:27.530\nOf course, Africa is a continent\nfull of catastrophes:\n\n00:13:27.554 --> 00:13:30.934\nThere are immense ones,\nsuch as the horrific rapes in Congo\n\n00:13:30.958 --> 00:13:32.584\nand depressing ones,\n\n00:13:32.608 --> 00:13:37.108\nsuch as the fact that 5,000 people apply\nfor one job vacancy in Nigeria.\n\n00:13:37.958 --> 00:13:41.521\nBut there are other stories\nthat are not about catastrophe,\n\n00:13:41.545 --> 00:13:44.934\nand it is very important, it is just\nas important, to talk about them.\n\n00:13:44.958 --> 00:13:46.934\nI've always felt that it is impossible\n\n00:13:46.958 --> 00:13:49.934\nto engage properly\nwith a place or a person\n\n00:13:49.958 --> 00:13:53.934\nwithout engaging with all of the stories\nof that place and that person.\n\n00:13:53.958 --> 00:13:57.538\nThe consequence\nof the single story is this:\n\n00:13:57.562 --> 00:13:59.519\nIt robs people of dignity.\n\n00:14:00.290 --> 00:14:03.934\nIt makes our recognition\nof our equal humanity difficult.\n\n00:14:03.958 --> 00:14:08.122\nIt emphasizes how we are different\nrather than how we are similar.\n\n00:14:08.958 --> 00:14:11.447\nSo what if before my Mexican trip,\n\n00:14:11.471 --> 00:14:14.934\nI had followed the immigration\ndebate from both sides,\n\n00:14:14.958 --> 00:14:16.934\nthe U.S. and the Mexican?\n\n00:14:16.958 --> 00:14:20.934\nWhat if my mother had told us\nthat Fide's family was poor\n\n00:14:20.958 --> 00:14:22.934\nand hardworking?\n\n00:14:22.958 --> 00:14:25.054\nWhat if we had an African\ntelevision network\n\n00:14:25.078 --> 00:14:28.934\nthat broadcast diverse\nAfrican stories all over the world?\n\n00:14:28.958 --> 00:14:33.289\nWhat the Nigerian writer Chinua Achebe\ncalls \"a balance of stories.\"\n\n00:14:33.313 --> 00:14:37.289\nWhat if my roommate knew\nabout my Nigerian publisher,\n\n00:14:37.313 --> 00:14:38.934\nMuhtar Bakare,\n\n00:14:38.958 --> 00:14:41.006\na remarkable man who left\nhis job in a bank\n\n00:14:41.030 --> 00:14:43.935\nto follow his dream\nand start a publishing house?\n\n00:14:43.959 --> 00:14:47.646\nNow, the conventional wisdom\nwas that Nigerians don't read literature.\n\n00:14:47.670 --> 00:14:48.924\nHe disagreed.\n\n00:14:48.948 --> 00:14:52.034\nHe felt that people\nwho could read, would read,\n\n00:14:52.058 --> 00:14:55.934\nif you made literature affordable\nand available to them.\n\n00:14:56.624 --> 00:14:58.934\nShortly after he published my first novel,\n\n00:14:58.958 --> 00:15:01.934\nI went to a TV station\nin Lagos to do an interview,\n\n00:15:01.958 --> 00:15:05.149\nand a woman who worked there\nas a messenger came up to me and said,\n\n00:15:05.173 --> 00:15:07.934\n\"I really liked your novel.\nI didn't like the ending.\n\n00:15:07.958 --> 00:15:11.197\nNow, you must write a sequel,\nand this is what will happen ...\"\n\n00:15:11.221 --> 00:15:13.935\n(Laughter)\n\n00:15:13.959 -->

"transcript": "I want to start with a game. Okay? And to win this game, all you have to do is see the reality that's in front of you as it really is, all right? So we have two panels here, of colored dots. And one of those dots is the same in the two panels. And you have to tell me which one.Now, I narrowed it down to the gray one, the green one, and, say, the orange one. So by a show of hands, we'll start with the easiest one. Show of hands: how many people think it's the gray one? Really? Okay. How many people think it's the green one? And how many people think it's the orange one? Pretty even split.Let's find out what the reality is. Here is the orange one.(Laughter)Here is the green one. And here is the gray one.(Laughter)So for all of you who saw that, you're complete realists. All right?(Laughter)So this is pretty amazing, isn't it? Because nearly every living system has evolved the ability to detect light in one way or another. So for us, seeing color is one of the simplest things the brain does. And yet, even at this most fundamental level, context is everything. What I'm going to talk about is not that context is everything, but why context is everything. Because it's answering that question that tells us not only why we see what we do, but who we are as individuals, and who we are as a society.But first, we have to ask another question, which is, \"What is color for?\" And instead of telling you, I'll just show you. What you see here is a jungle scene, and you see the surfaces according to the amount of light that those surfaces reflect. Now, can any of you see the predator that's about to jump out at you? And if you haven't seen it yet, you're dead, right?(Laughter)Can anyone see it? Anyone? No? Now let's see the surfaces according to the quality of light that they reflect. And now you see it.So, color enables us to see the similarities and differences between surfaces, according to the full spectrum of light that they reflect. But what you've just done is in many respects mathematically impossible. Why? Because, as Berkeley tells us, we have no direct access to our physical world, other than through our senses. And the light that falls onto our eyes is determined by multiple things in the world, not only the color of objects, but also the color of their illumination, and the color of the space between us and those objects. You vary any one of those parameters, and you'll change the color of the light that falls onto your eye.This is a huge problem, because it means that the same image could have an infinite number of possible real-world sources. Let me show you what I mean. Imagine that this is the back of your eye, okay? And these are two projections from the world. They're identical in every single way. Identical in shape, size, spectral content. They are the same, as far as your eye is concerned. And yet they come from completely different sources. The one on the right comes from a yellow surface, in shadow, oriented facing the left, viewed through a pinkish medium. The one on the left comes from an orange surface, under direct light, facing to the right, viewed through sort of a bluish medium. Completely different meanings, giving rise to the exact same retinal information. And yet it's only the retinal information that we get.So how on Earth do we even see? So if you remember anything in this next 18 minutes, remember this: that the light that falls onto your eye, sensory information, is meaningless, because it could mean literally anything. And what's true for sensory information is true for information generally. There's no inherent meaning in information. It's what we do with that information that matters.So, how do we see? Well, we see by learning to see. The brain evolved the mechanisms for finding patterns, finding relationships in information, and associating those relationships with a behavioral meaning, a significance, by interacting with the world. We're very aware of this in the form of more cognitive attributes, like language. I'm going to give you some letter strings, and I want you to read them out for me, if you can.Audience: \"Can you read this?\" \"You are not reading this.\" \"What are you reading?\"Beau Lotto: \"What are you reading?\" Half the letters are missing, right? There's no a priori reason why an \"H\" has to go between that \"W\" and \"A.\" But you put one there. Why? Because in the statistics of your past experience, it would have been useful to do so. So you do so again. And yet you don't put a letter after that first \"T.\" Why? Because it wouldn't have been useful in the past. So you don't do it again.So, let me show you how quickly our brains can redefine normality, even at the simplest thing the brain does, which is color. So if I could have the lights down up here. I want you to first notice that those two desert scenes are physically the same. One is simply the flipping of the other. Now I want you to look at that dot between the green and the red. And I want you to stare at that dot. Don't look anywhere else. We're going to look at it for about 30 seconds, which is a bit of a killer in an 18-minute talk.(Laughter)But I really want you to learn. And I'll tell you \u2014 don't look anywhere else \u2014 I'll tell you what's happening in your head. Your brain is learning, and it's learning that the right side of its visual field is under red illumination; the left side of its visual field is under green illumination. That's what it's learning. Okay? Now, when I tell you, I want you to look at the dot between the two desert scenes. So why don't you do that now?(Laughter)Can I have the lights up again?I take it from your response they don't look the same anymore, right?(Applause)Why? Because your brain is seeing that same information as if the right one is still under red light, and the left one is still under green light. That's your new normal. Okay? So, what does this mean for context? It means I can take two identical squares, put them in light and dark surrounds, and the one on the dark surround looks lighter than on the light surround. What's significant is not simply the light and dark surrounds that matter. It's what those light and dark surrounds meant for your behavior in the past.So I'll show you what I mean. Here we have that exact same illusion. We have two identical tiles on the left, one in a dark surround, one in a light surround. And the same thing over on the right. Now, I'll reveal those two scenes, but I'm not going to change anything within those boxes, except their meaning. And see what happens to your perception.Notice that on the left the two tiles look nearly completely opposite: one very white and one very dark, right? Whereas on the right, the two tiles look nearly the same. And yet there is still one on a dark surround, and one on a light surround. Why? Because if the tile in that shadow were in fact in shadow, and reflecting the same amount of light to your eye as the one outside the shadow, it would have to be more reflective \u2014 just the laws of physics. So you see it that way.Whereas on the right, the information is consistent with those two tiles being under the same light. If they're under the same light reflecting the same amount of light to your eye, then they must be equally reflective. So you see it that way. Which means we can bring all this information together to create some incredibly strong illusions.This is one I made a few years ago. And you'll notice you see a dark brown tile at the top, and a bright orange tile at the side. That is your perceptual reality. The physical reality is that those two tiles are the same.Here you see four gray tiles on your left, seven gray tiles on the right. I'm not going to change those tiles at all, but I'm going to reveal the rest of the scene. And see what happens to your perception. The four blue tiles on the left are gray. The seven yellow tiles on the right are also gray. They are the same. Okay? Don't believe me? Let's watch it again.What's true for color is also true for complex perceptions of motion. So, here we have \u2014 let's turn this around \u2014 a diamond. And what I'm going to do is, I'm going to hold it here, and I'm going to spin it. And for all of you, you'll see it probably spinning this direction. Now I want you to keep looking at it. Move your eyes around, blink, maybe close one eye. And suddenly it will flip, and start spinning the opposite direction. Yes? Raise your hand if you got that. Yes? Keep blinking. Every time you blink, it will switch. So I can ask you, which direction is it rotating? How do you know? Your brain doesn't know, because both are equally likely. So depending on where it looks, it flips between the two possibilities.Are we the only ones that see illusions? The answer to this question is no. Even the beautiful bumblebee, with its mere one million brain cells, which is 250 times fewer cells than you have in one retina, sees illusions, does the most complicated things that even our most sophisticated computers can't do. So in my lab we work on bumblebees, because we can completely control their experience, and see how it alters the architecture of their brain. We do this in what we call the Bee Matrix.Here you have the hive. You can see the queen bee, the large bee in the middle. Those are her daughters, the eggs. They go back and forth between this hive and the arena, via this tube. You'll see one of the bees come out here. You see how she has a little number on her? There's another one coming out, she also has a number on her. Now, they're not born that way, right? We pull them out, put them in the fridge, and they fall asleep. Then you can superglue little numbers on them.(Laughter)And now, in this experiment they get a reward if they go to the blue flowers. They land on the flower, stick their tongue in there, called a proboscis, and drink sugar water. She's drinking a glass of water that's about that big to you and I, will do that about three times, then fly. And sometimes they learn not to go to the blue, but to go where the other bees go. So they copy each other. They can count to five. They can recognize faces. And here she comes down the ladder. And she'll come into the hive, find an empty honey pot, and throw up, and that's honey.(Laughter)Now remember, she's supposed to be going to the blue flowers, but what are these bees doing in the upper right corner? It looks like they're going to green flowers. Now, are they getting it wrong? And the answer to the question is no. Those are actually blue flowers. But those are blue flowers under green light. So they're using the relationships between the colors to solve the puzzle, which is exactly what we do.So, illusions are often used, especially in art, in the words of a more contemporary artist, \"to demonstrate the fragility of our senses.\" Okay, this is complete rubbish. The senses aren't fragile. And if they were, we wouldn't be here. Instead, color tells us something completely different, that the brain didn't actually evolve to see the world the way it is. We can't. Instead, the brain evolved to see the world the way it was useful to see in the past. And how we see is by continually redefining normality.So, how can we take this incredible capacity of plasticity of the brain and get people to experience their world differently? Well, one of the ways we do it in my lab and studio is we translate the light into sound, and we enable people to hear their visual world. And they can navigate the world using their ears.Here's David on the right, and he's holding a camera. On the left is what his camera sees. And you'll see there's a faint line going across that image. That line is broken up into 32 squares. In each square, we calculate the average color. And then we just simply translate that into sound. And now he's going to turn around, close his eyes, and find a plate on the ground with his eyes closed.(Continuous sound)(Sound changes momentarily)(Sound changes momentarily)(Sound changes momentarily)(Sound changes momentarily)(Sound changes momentarily)Beau Lotto: He finds it. Amazing, right? So not only can we create a prosthetic for the visually impaired, but we can also investigate how people literally make sense of the world. But we can also do something else. We can also make music with color. So, working with kids, they created images, thinking about what might the images you see sound like if we could listen to them. And then we translated these images. And this is one of those images. And this is a six-year-old child composing a piece of music for a 32-piece orchestra. And this is what it sounds like.(Electronic representation of orchestral music)So, a six-year-old child. Okay?Now, what does all this mean? What this suggests is that no one is an outside observer of nature, okay? We're not defined by our central properties, by the bits that make us up. We're defined by our environment and our interaction with that environment, by our ecology. And that ecology is necessarily relative, historical and empirical. So, what I'd like to finish with is this over here. Because what I've been trying to do is really celebrate uncertainty. Because I think only through uncertainty is there potential for understanding.So, if some of you are still feeling a bit too certain, I'd like to do this one. So, if we have the lights down. And what we have here \u2014 Can everyone see 25 purple surfaces on your left, and 25, call it yellowish, surfaces on your right? So now, what I want to do, I'm going to put the middle nine surfaces here under yellow illumination, by simply putting a filter behind them. Now you can see that changes the light that's coming through there, right? Because now the light is going through a yellowish filter and then a purplish filter. I'm going to do the opposite on the left here. I'm going to put the middle nine under a purplish light.Now, some of you will have noticed that the consequence is that the light coming through those middle nine on the right, or your left, is exactly the same as the light coming through the middle nine on your right. Agreed? Yes? Okay. So they are physically the same. Let's pull the covers off. Now remember \u2014 you know that the middle nine are exactly the same. Do they look the same? No. The question is, \"Is that an illusion?\" And I'll leave you with that.So, thank you very much.(Laughter)(Applause)", "id": 653, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:13.323 --> 00:00:15.949\nI want to start with a game.

Okay.\n\n00:00:49.958 --> 00:00:52.932\nHow many people think it's the green one?\n\n00:00:54.535 --> 00:00:56.969\nAnd how many people\nthink it's the orange one?\n\n00:00:58.833 --> 00:01:00.718\nPretty even split.\n\n00:01:02.281 --> 00:01:04.548\nLet's find out what the reality is.\n\n00:01:04.572 --> 00:01:06.392\nHere is the orange one.\n\n00:01:07.671 --> 00:01:09.107\n(Laughter)\n\n00:01:09.958 --> 00:01:11.282\nHere is the green one.\n\n00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:15.171\nAnd here is the gray one.\n\n00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:19.934\n(Laughter)\n\n00:01:19.958 --> 00:01:22.757\nSo for all of you who saw that,\nyou're complete realists.\n\n00:01:23.226 --> 00:01:24.399\nAll right?\n\n00:01:24.423 --> 00:01:25.934\n(Laughter)\n\n00:01:25.958 --> 00:01:27.729\nSo this is pretty amazing, isn't it?\n\n00:01:27.753 --> 00:01:29.555\nBecause nearly every living system\n\n00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:33.487\nhas evolved the ability\nto detect light in one way or another.\n\n00:01:33.511 --> 00:01:35.352\nSo for us, seeing color\n\n00:01:35.376 --> 00:01:37.686\nis one of the simplest things\nthe brain does.\n\n00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:40.511\nAnd yet, even at this\nmost fundamental level,\n\n00:01:40.535 --> 00:01:43.154\ncontext is everything.\n\n00:01:43.178 --> 00:01:46.359\nWhat I'm going to talk about\nis not that context is everything,\n\n00:01:46.383 --> 00:01:48.408\nbut why context is everything.\n\n00:01:48.432 --> 00:01:50.648\nBecause it's answering that question\n\n00:01:50.672 --> 00:01:54.216\nthat tells us not only\nwhy we see what we do,\n\n00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:55.934\nbut who we are as individuals,\n\n00:01:55.958 --> 00:01:57.839\nand who we are as a society.\n\n00:01:59.447 --> 00:02:01.510\nBut first, we have to ask\nanother question,\n\n00:02:01.534 --> 00:02:03.042\nwhich is, \"What is color for?\"\n\n00:02:03.066 --> 00:02:05.281\nAnd instead of telling you,\nI'll just show you.\n\n00:02:05.305 --> 00:02:07.934\nWhat you see here is a jungle scene,\n\n00:02:07.958 --> 00:02:10.742\nand you see the surfaces\naccording to the amount of light\n\n00:02:10.766 --> 00:02:12.431\nthat those surfaces reflect.\n\n00:02:12.455 --> 00:02:16.838\nNow, can any of you see the predator\nthat's about to jump out at you?\n\n00:02:16.862 --> 00:02:19.886\nAnd if you haven't seen it yet,\nyou're dead, right?\n\n00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:20.911\n(Laughter)\n\n00:02:20.935 --> 00:02:23.273\nCan anyone see it? Anyone? No?\n\n00:02:23.297 --> 00:02:24.766\nNow let's see the surfaces\n\n00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:27.644\naccording to the quality of light\nthat they reflect.\n\n00:02:27.668 --> 00:02:29.209\nAnd now you see it.\n\n00:02:30.287 --> 00:02:32.552\nSo, color enables us to see\n\n00:02:32.576 --> 00:02:35.002\nthe similarities and differences\nbetween surfaces,\n\n00:02:35.026 --> 00:02:38.072\naccording to the full spectrum\nof light that they reflect.\n\n00:02:38.096 --> 00:02:39.557\nBut what you've just done\n\n00:02:39.581 --> 00:02:42.621\nis in many respects\nmathematically impossible.\n\n00:02:42.645 --> 00:02:43.892\nWhy?\n\n00:02:43.916 --> 00:02:45.346\nBecause, as Berkeley tells us,\n\n00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:47.933\nwe have no direct access\nto our physical world,\n\n00:02:47.957 --> 00:02:49.934\nother than through our senses.\n\n00:02:49.958 --> 00:02:51.773\nAnd the light that falls onto our eyes\n\n00:02:51.797 --> 00:02:54.059\nis determined by multiple\nthings in the world,\n\n00:02:54.083 --> 00:02:55.934\nnot only the color of objects,\n\n00:02:55.958 --> 00:02:57.934\nbut also the color of their illumination,\n\n00:02:57.958 --> 00:03:00.767\nand the color of the space\nbetween us and those objects.\n\n00:03:00.791 --> 00:03:03.044\nYou vary any one of those parameters,\n\n00:03:03.068 --> 00:03:06.590\nand you'll change the color\nof the light that falls onto your eye.\n\n00:03:08.106 --> 00:03:09.290\nThis is a huge problem,\n\n00:03:09.314 --> 00:03:12.283\nbecause it means that the same image\n\n00:03:12.307 --> 00:03:15.828\ncould have an infinite number\nof possible real-world sources.\n\n00:03:15.852 --> 00:03:17.193\nLet me show you what I mean.\n\n00:03:17.217 --> 00:03:20.050\nImagine that this\nis the back of your eye, okay?\n\n00:03:20.074 --> 00:03:22.574\nAnd these are two projections\nfrom the world.\n\n00:03:22.598 --> 00:03:25.061\nThey're identical in every single way.\n\n00:03:25.085 --> 00:03:29.117\nIdentical in shape,\nsize, spectral content.\n\n00:03:29.141 --> 00:03:31.910\nThey are the same,\nas far as your eye is concerned.\n\n00:03:32.956 --> 00:03:37.050\nAnd yet they come\nfrom completely different sources.\n\n00:03:38.178 --> 00:03:42.679\nThe one on the right\ncomes from a yellow surface,\n\n00:03:42.703 --> 00:03:45.108\nin shadow, oriented facing the left,\n\n00:03:45.132 --> 00:03:48.004\nviewed through a pinkish medium.\n\n00:03:48.028 --> 00:03:51.272\nThe one on the left comes\nfrom an orange surface,\n\n00:03:51.296 --> 00:03:53.479\nunder direct light, facing to the right,\n\n00:03:53.503 --> 00:03:55.487\nviewed through sort of a bluish medium.\n\n00:03:55.511 --> 00:03:57.686\nCompletely different meanings,\n\n00:03:57.710 --> 00:04:00.987\ngiving rise to the exact same\nretinal information.\n\n00:04:01.011 --> 00:04:04.328\nAnd yet it's only the retinal\ninformation that we get.\n\n00:04:05.038 --> 00:04:08.320\nSo how on Earth do we even see?\n\n00:04:08.344 --> 00:04:11.551\nSo if you remember anything\nin this next 18 minutes,\n\n00:04:11.575 --> 00:04:12.821\nremember this:\n\n00:04:12.845 --> 00:04:14.787\nthat the light that falls onto your eye,\n\n00:04:14.811 --> 00:04:17.234\nsensory information, is meaningless,\n\n00:04:17.258 --> 00:04:19.376\nbecause it could mean literally anything.\n\n00:04:19.956 --> 00:04:23.501\nAnd what's true for sensory information\nis true for information generally.\n\n00:04:23.525 --> 00:04:25.558\nThere's no inherent\nmeaning in information.\n\n00:04:25.582 --> 00:04:27.995\nIt's what we do with that\ninformation that matters.\n\n00:04:28.693 --> 00:04:32.416\nSo, how do we see?\nWell, we see by learning to see.\n\n00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:35.979\nThe brain evolved the mechanisms\nfor finding patterns,\n\n00:04:36.003 --> 00:04:38.043\nfinding relationships in information,\n\n00:04:38.067 --> 00:04:42.265\nand associating those relationships\nwith a behavioral meaning,\n\n00:04:42.289 --> 00:04:45.154\na significance, by interacting\nwith the world.\n\n00:04:45.178 --> 00:04:46.933\nWe're very aware of this\n\n00:04:46.957 --> 00:04:49.786\nin the form of more cognitive\nattributes, like language.\n\n00:04:49.810 --> 00:04:51.843\nI'm going to give you some letter strings,\n\n00:04:51.867 --> 00:04:54.360\nand I want you to read them\nout for me, if you can.\n\n00:04:54.384 --> 00:04:56.049\nAudience: \"Can you read this?\"\n\n00:04:56.890 --> 00:04:58.934\n\"You are not reading this.\"\n\n00:04:59.388 --> 00:05:00.834\n\"What are you reading?\"\n\n00:05:00.858 --> 00:05:04.242\nBeau Lotto: \"What are you reading?\"\nHalf the letters are missing, right?\n\n00:05:04.266 --> 00:05:05.575\nThere's no a priori reason\n\n00:05:05.599 --> 00:05:08.091\nwhy an \"H\" has to go\nbetween that \"W\" and \"A.\"\n\n00:05:08.115 --> 00:05:09.670\nBut you put one there. Why?\n\n00:05:09.694 --> 00:05:12.050\nBecause in the statistics\nof your past experience,\n\n00:05:12.074 --> 00:05:13.768\nit would have been useful to do so.\n\n00:05:13.792 --> 00:05:15.233\nSo you do so again.\n\n00:05:15.257 --> 00:05:17.934\nAnd yet you don't put a letter\nafter that first \"T.\"\n\n00:05:17.958 --> 00:05:20.822\nWhy? Because it wouldn't have been\nuseful in the past.\n\n00:05:20.846 --> 00:05:22.934\nSo you don't do it again.\n\n00:05:22.958 --> 00:05:26.827\nSo, let me show you how quickly\nour brains can redefine normality,\n\n00:05:26.851 --> 00:05:29.581\neven at the simplest thing\nthe brain does, which is color.\n\n00:05:29.605 --> 00:05:32.239\nSo if I could have\nthe lights down up here.\n\n00:05:32.263 --> 00:05:36.062\nI want you to first notice that those\ntwo desert scenes are physically the same.\n\n00:05:36.086 --> 00:05:38.263\nOne is simply the flipping of the other.\n\n00:05:40.042 --> 00:05:42.352\nNow I want you to look at that dot\n\n00:05:42.376 --> 00:05:44.933\nbetween the green and the red.\n\n00:05:44.957 --> 00:05:47.934\nAnd I want you to stare at that dot.\nDon't look anywhere else.\n\n00:05:47.958 --> 00:05:50.164\nWe're going to look\nat it for about 30 seconds,\n\n00:05:50.188 --> 00:05:52.630\nwhich is a bit of a killer\nin an 18-minute talk.\n\n00:05:52.654 --> 00:05:53.947\n(Laughter)\n\n00:05:53.971 --> 00:05:55.565\nBut I really want you to learn.\n\n00:05:55.589 --> 00:05:57.890\nAnd I'll tell you -- don't look\nanywhere else --\n\n00:05:57.914 --> 00:05:59.969\nI'll tell you what's\nhappening in your head.\n\n00:05:59.993 --> 00:06:01.260\nYour brain is learning,\n\n00:06:01.284 --> 00:06:04.012\nand it's learning\nthat the right side of its visual field\n\n00:06:04.036 --> 00:06:05.329\nis under red illumination;\n\n00:06:05.353 --> 00:06:08.280\nthe left side of its visual field\nis under green illumination.\n\n00:06:08.304 --> 00:06:11.190\nThat's what it's learning. Okay?\n\n00:06:11.214 --> 00:06:15.893\nNow, when I tell you, I want you to look\nat the dot between the two desert scenes.\n\n00:06:15.917 --> 00:06:17.932\nSo why don't you do that now?\n\n00:06:17.956 --> 00:06:21.316\n(Laughter)\n\n00:06:21.340 --> 00:06:23.243\nCan I have the lights up again?\n\n00:06:23.267 --> 00:06:26.733\nI take it from your response\nthey don't look the same anymore, right?\n\n00:06:26.757 --> 00:06:27.934\n(Applause)\n\n00:06:27.958 --> 00:06:30.934\nWhy? Because your brain\nis seeing that same information\n\n00:06:30.958 --> 00:06:33.645\nas if the right one is still\nunder red light,\n\n00:06:33.669 --> 00:06:35.827\nand the left one is still\nunder green light.\n\n00:06:35.851 --> 00:06:37.216\nThat's your new normal.\n\n00:06:37.240 --> 00:06:39.246\nOkay? So, what does this mean for context?\n\n00:06:39.270 --> 00:06:41.604\nIt means I can take two identical squares,\n\n00:06:41.628 --> 00:06:43.448\nput them in light and dark surrounds,\n\n00:06:43.472 --> 00:06:46.957\nand the one on the dark surround\nlooks lighter than on the light surround.\n\n00:06:46.981 --> 00:06:50.565\nWhat's significant is not simply the light\nand dark surrounds that matter.\n\n00:06:50.589 --> 00:06:54.234\nIt's what those light and dark surrounds\nmeant for your behavior in the past.\n\n00:06:54.258 --> 00:06:55.655\nSo I'll show you what I mean.\n\n00:06:55.679 --> 00:06:57.662\nHere we have that exact same illusion.\n\n00:06:57.686 --> 00:06:59.812\nWe have two identical tiles on the left,\n\n00:06:59.836 --> 00:07:02.122\none in a dark surround,\none in a light surround.\n\n00:07:02.146 --> 00:07:04.225\nAnd the same thing over on the right.\n\n00:07:04.249 --> 00:07:07.100\nNow, I'll reveal those two scenes,\n\n00:07:07.124 --> 00:07:09.792\nbut I'm not going to change\nanything within those boxes,\n\n00:07:09.816 --> 00:07:10.967\nexcept their meaning.\n\n00:07:10.991 --> 00:07:13.304\nAnd see what happens to your perception.\n\n00:07:13.328 --> 00:07:14.934\nNotice that on the left\n\n00:07:14.958 --> 00:07:17.723\nthe two tiles look nearly\ncompletely opposite:\n\n00:07:17.747 --> 00:07:20.838\none very white and one very dark, right?\n\n00:07:20.862 --> 00:07:24.137\nWhereas on the right,\nthe two tiles look nearly the same.\n\n00:07:24.161 --> 00:07:26.399\nAnd yet there is still one\non a dark surround,\n\n00:07:26.423 --> 00:07:27.788\nand one on a light surround.\n\n00:07:27.812 --> 00:07:28.963\nWhy?\n\n00:07:28.987 --> 00:07:32.934\nBecause if the tile in that shadow\nwere in fact in shadow,\n\n00:07:32.958 --> 00:07:35.387\nand reflecting the same\namount of light to your eye\n\n00:07:35.411 --> 00:07:37.179\nas the one outside the shadow,\n\n00:07:37.203 --> 00:07:40.600\nit would have to be more reflective\n-- just the laws of physics.\n\n00:07:40.624 --> 00:07:42.142\nSo you see it that way.\n\n00:07:42.166 --> 00:07:44.824\nWhereas on the right,\nthe information is consistent\n\n00:07:44.848 --> 00:07:47.531\nwith those two tiles\nbeing under the same light.\n\n00:07:47.555 --> 00:07:51.388\nIf they're under the same light reflecting\nthe same amount of light to your eye,\n\n00:07:51.412 --> 00:07:53.197\nthen they must be equally reflective.\n\n00:07:53.221 --> 00:07:54.484\nSo you see it that way.\n\n00:07:54.508 --> 00:07:57.034\nWhich means we can bring\nall this information together\n\n00:07:57.058 --> 00:07:59.106\nto create some incredibly\nstrong illusions.\n\n00:07:59.130 --> 00:08:00.934\nThis is one I made a few years ago.\n\n00:08:00.958 --> 00:08:04.271\nAnd you'll notice you see\na dark brown tile at the top,\n\n00:08:04.295 --> 00:08:06.774\nand a bright orange tile at the side.\n\n00:08:06.798 --> 00:08:08.528\nThat is your perceptual reality.\n\n00:08:08.552 --> 00:08:11.516\nThe physical reality\nis that those two tiles are the same.\n\n00:08:13.958 --> 00:08:16.934\nHere you see four gray tiles on your left,\n\n00:08:16.958 --> 00:08:19.470\nseven gray tiles on the right.\n\n00:08:19.494 --> 00:08:21.551\nI'm not going to change\nthose tiles at all,\n\n00:08:21.575 --> 00:08:23.742\nbut I'm going to reveal\nthe rest of the scene.\n\n00:08:23.766 --> 00:08:25.724\nAnd see what happens to your perception.\n\n00:08:26.319 --> 00:08:29.828\nThe four blue tiles on the left are gray.\n\n00:08:29.852 --> 00:08:33.505\nThe seven yellow tiles\non the right are also gray.\n\n00:08:33.529 --> 00:08:35.410\nThey are the same. Okay?\n\n00:08:35.434 --> 00:08:37.472\nDon't believe me? Let's watch it again.\n\n00:08:39.356 --> 00:08:43.610\nWhat's true for color is also true\nfor complex perceptions of motion.\n\n00:08:43.634 --> 00:08:46.443\nSo, here we have --\n\n00:08:46.467 --> 00:08:49.731\nlet's turn this around -- a diamond.\n\n00:08:50.958 --> 00:08:53.578\nAnd what I'm going to do is,\nI'm going to hold it here,\n\n00:08:53.602 --> 00:08:55.448\nand I'm going to spin it.\n\n00:08:56.789 --> 00:08:59.933\nAnd for all of you, you'll see it\nprobably spinning this direction.\n\n00:08:59.957 --> 00:09:02.569\nNow I want you to keep looking at it.\n\n00:09:02.593 --> 00:09:05.093\nMove your eyes around,\nblink, maybe close one eye.\n\n00:09:05.117 --> 00:09:08.934\nAnd suddenly it will flip, and start\nspinning the opposite direction.\n\n00:09:08.958 --> 00:09:12.130\nYes? Raise your hand if you got that. Yes?\n\n00:09:12.154 --> 00:09:13.361\nKeep blinking.\n\n00:09:13.385 --> 00:09:15.970\nEvery time you blink, it will switch.\n\n00:09:15.994 --> 00:09:18.591\nSo I can ask you,\nwhich direction is it rotating?\n\n00:09:20.115 --> 00:09:21.385\nHow do you know?\n\n00:09:22.098 --> 00:09:25.208\nYour brain doesn't know,\nbecause both are equally likely.\n\n00:09:25.232 --> 00:09:26.770\nSo depending on where it looks,\n\n00:09:26.794 --> 00:09:30.123\nit flips between the two possibilities.\n\n00:09:30.147 --> 00:09:32.071\nAre we the only ones that see illusions?\n\n00:09:32.095 --> 00:09:33.934\nThe answer to this question is no.\n\n00:09:33.958 --> 00:09:35.677\nEven the beautiful bumblebee,\n\n00:09:35.701 --> 00:09:38.575\nwith its mere one million brain cells,\n\n00:09:38.599 --> 00:09:41.614\nwhich is 250 times fewer cells\nthan you have in one retina,\n\n00:09:41.638 --> 00:09:44.466\nsees illusions, does\nthe most complicated things\n\n00:09:44.490 --> 00:09:46.934\nthat even our most\nsophisticated computers can't do.\n\n00:09:47.299 --> 00:09:49.155\nSo in my lab we work on bumblebees,\n\n00:09:49.179 --> 00:09:51.668\nbecause we can completely\ncontrol their experience,\n\n00:09:51.692 --> 00:09:54.225\nand see how it alters\nthe architecture of their brain.\n\n00:09:54.249 --> 00:09:56.350\nWe do this in what we call the Bee Matrix.\n\n00:09:56.374 --> 00:09:57.648\nHere you have the hive.\n\n00:09:57.672 --> 00:10:00.267\nYou can see the queen bee,\nthe large bee in the middle.\n\n00:10:00.291 --> 00:10:01.917\nThose are her daughters, the eggs.\n\n00:10:01.941 --> 00:10:05.556\nThey go back and forth between this hive\nand the arena, via this tube.\n\n00:10:08.800 --> 00:10:11.387\nYou'll see one of the bees come out here.\n\n00:10:11.411 --> 00:10:13.505\nYou see how she has\na little number on her?\n\n00:10:13.958 --> 00:10:16.894\nThere's another one coming out,\nshe also has a number on her.\n\n00:10:17.383 --> 00:10:19.654\nNow, they're not born that way, right?\n\n00:10:19.678 --> 00:10:22.693\nWe pull them out, put them\nin the fridge, and they fall asleep.\n\n00:10:22.717 --> 00:10:25.010\nThen you can superglue\nlittle numbers on them.\n\n00:10:25.034 --> 00:10:26.217\n(Laughter)\n\n00:10:26.241 --> 00:10:29.934\nAnd now, in this experiment they get\na reward if they go to the blue flowers.\n\n00:10:29.958 --> 00:10:31.151\nThey land on the flower,\n\n00:10:31.175 --> 00:10:34.684\nstick their tongue in there,\ncalled a proboscis, and drink sugar water.\n\n00:10:34.708 --> 00:10:37.866\nShe's drinking a glass of water\nthat's about that big to you and I,\n\n00:10:37.890 --> 00:10:41.524\nwill do that about three times, then fly.\n\n00:10:43.864 --> 00:10:46.142\nAnd sometimes they learn\nnot to go to the blue,\n\n00:10:46.166 --> 00:10:47.934\nbut to go where the other bees go.\n\n00:10:47.958 --> 00:10:49.172\nSo they copy each other.\n\n00:10:49.196 --> 00:10:51.482\nThey can count to five.\nThey can recognize faces.\n\n00:10:51.506 --> 00:10:53.467\nAnd here she comes down the ladder.\n\n00:10:53.491 --> 00:10:56.072\nAnd she'll come into the hive,\nfind an empty honey pot,\n\n00:10:56.096 --> 00:10:58.153\nand throw up, and that's honey.\n\n00:10:58.177 --> 00:10:59.328\n(Laughter)\n\n00:10:59.352 --> 00:11:04.162\nNow remember, she's supposed\nto be going to the blue flowers,\n\n00:11:04.186 --> 00:11:06.813\nbut what are these bees doing\nin the upper right corner?\n\n00:11:06.837 --> 00:11:09.326\nIt looks like they're\ngoing to green flowers.\n\n00:11:09.350 --> 00:11:12.156\nNow, are they getting it wrong?\n\n00:11:12.180 --> 00:11:15.672\nAnd the answer to the question is no.\nThose are actually blue flowers.\n\n00:11:15.696 --> 00:11:19.259\nBut those are blue flowers\nunder green light.\n\n00:11:19.283 --> 00:11:23.015\nSo they're using the relationships\nbetween the colors to solve the puzzle,\n\n00:11:23.039 --> 00:11:25.110\nwhich is exactly what we do.\n\n00:11:25.134 --> 00:11:27.465\nSo, illusions are often used,\n\n00:11:27.489 --> 00:11:31.100\nespecially in art, in the words\nof a more contemporary artist,\n\n00:11:31.124 --> 00:11:33.584\n\"to demonstrate the fragility\nof our senses.\"\n\n00:11:33.608 --> 00:11:35.932\nOkay, this is complete rubbish.\n\n00:11:35.956 --> 00:11:39.906\nThe senses aren't fragile.\nAnd if they were, we wouldn't be here.\n\n00:11:39.930 --> 00:11:42.829\nInstead, color tells us\nsomething completely different,\n\n00:11:42.853 --> 00:11:46.221\nthat the brain didn't actually evolve\nto see the world the way it is.\n\n00:11:46.245 --> 00:11:47.456\nWe can't.\n\n00:11:47.480 --> 00:11:49.892\nInstead, the brain\nevolved to see the world\n\n00:11:49.916 --> 00:11:52.934\nthe way it was useful to see in the past.\n\n00:11:52.958 --> 00:11:57.129\nAnd how we see is by continually\nredefining normality.\n\n00:11:59.448 --> 00:12:06.320\nSo, how can we take this incredible\ncapacity of plasticity of the brain\n\n00:12:06.344 --> 00:12:08.868\nand get people to experience\ntheir world differently?\n\n00:12:08.892 --> 00:12:11.589\nWell, one of the ways we do it\nin my lab and studio\n\n00:12:11.613 --> 00:12:14.851\nis we translate the light into sound,\n\n00:12:14.875 --> 00:12:17.949\nand we enable people to hear\ntheir visual world.\n\n00:12:18.958 --> 00:12:21.616\nAnd they can navigate\nthe world using their ears.\n\n00:12:22.223 --> 00:12:25.579\nHere's David on the right,\nand he's holding a camera.\n\n00:12:25.603 --> 00:12:27.333\nOn the left is what his camera sees.\n\n00:12:27.357 --> 00:12:30.365\nAnd you'll see there's a faint line\ngoing across that image.\n\n00:12:30.389 --> 00:12:32.798\nThat line is broken up into 32 squares.\n\n00:12:32.822 --> 00:12:35.149\nIn each square,\nwe calculate the average color.\n\n00:12:35.173 --> 00:12:37.554\nAnd then we just simply\ntranslate that into sound.\n\n00:12:37.578 --> 00:12:40.811\nAnd now he's going to turn around,\n\n00:12:40.835 --> 00:12:43.695\nclose his eyes,\n\n00:12:43.719 --> 00:12:46.981\nand find a plate on the ground\nwith his eyes closed.\n\n00:12:47.005 --> 00:12:48.229\n(Continuous sound)\n\n00:12:49.962 --> 00:12:51.290\n(Sound changes momentarily)\n\n00:12:52.100 --> 00:12:53.450\n(Sound changes momentarily)\n\n00:12:54.941 --> 00:12:57.171\n(Sound changes momentarily)\n\n00:12:59.378 --> 00:13:01.215\n(Sound changes momentarily)\n\n00:13:03.084 --> 00:13:04.921\n(Sound changes momentarily)\n\n00:13:05.571 --> 00:13:07.512\nBeau Lotto: He finds it. Amazing, right?\n\n00:13:07.536 --> 00:13:10.599\nSo not only can we create a prosthetic\nfor the visually impaired,\n\n00:13:10.623 --> 00:13:13.106\nbut we can also investigate\n\n00:13:13.130 --> 00:13:15.826\nhow people literally\nmake sense of the world.\n\n00:13:15.850 --> 00:13:17.485\nBut we can also do something else.\n\n00:13:17.509 --> 00:13:20.597\nWe can also make music with color.\n\n00:13:20.621 --> 00:13:22.297\nSo, working with kids,\n\n00:13:22.321 --> 00:13:24.114\nthey created images,\n\n00:13:24.138 --> 00:13:26.254\nthinking about what might\nthe images you see\n\n00:13:26.278 --> 00:13:28.102\nsound like if we could listen to them.\n\n00:13:28.126 --> 00:13:29.934\nAnd then we translated these images.\n\n00:13:29.958 --> 00:13:31.934\nAnd this is one of those images.\n\n00:13:31.958 --> 00:13:34.934\nAnd this is a six-year-old child\ncomposing a piece of music\n\n00:13:34.958 --> 00:13:37.934\nfor a 32-piece orchestra.\n\n00:13:37.958 --> 00:13:39.959\nAnd this is what it sounds like.\n\n00:13:39.983 --> 00:13:46.661\n(Electronic representation\nof orchestral music)\n\n00:14:06.547 --> 00:14:08.814\nSo, a six-year-old child. Okay?\n\n00:14:08.838 --> 00:14:10.955\nNow, what does all this mean?\n\n00:14:12.551 --> 00:14:16.891\nWhat this suggests is that no one\nis an outside observer of nature, okay?\n\n00:14:16.915 --> 00:14:18.980\nWe're not defined\nby our central properties,\n\n00:14:19.004 --> 00:14:20.668\nby the bits that make us up.\n\n00:14:20.692 --> 00:14:24.366\nWe're defined by our environment\nand our interaction with that environment,\n\n00:14:24.390 --> 00:14:26.042\nby our ecology.\n\n00:14:26.066 --> 00:14:32.098\nAnd that ecology is necessarily\nrelative, historical and empirical.\n\n00:14:34.003 --> 00:14:38.264\nSo, what I'd like to finish with\nis this over here.\n\n00:14:38.288 --> 00:14:41.549\nBecause what I've been trying to do\nis really celebrate uncertainty.\n\n00:14:41.573 --> 00:14:45.334\nBecause I think only through uncertainty\nis there potential for understanding.\n\n00:14:45.358 --> 00:14:48.226\nSo, if some of you are still\nfeeling a bit too certain,\n\n00:14:48.250 --> 00:14:49.792\nI'd like to do this one.\n\n00:14:49.816 --> 00:14:52.230\nSo, if we have the lights down.\n\n00:14:52.254 --> 00:14:57.136\nAnd what we have here --\n\n00:14:58.344 --> 00:15:03.114\nCan everyone see 25\npurple surfaces on your left,\n\n00:15:03.138 --> 00:15:07.330\nand 25, call it yellowish,\nsurfaces on your right?\n\n00:15:07.354 --> 00:15:08.668\nSo now, what I want to do,\n\n00:15:08.692 --> 00:15:11.709\nI'm going to put\nthe middle nine surfaces here\n\n00:15:11.733 --> 00:15:13.360\nunder yellow illumination,\n\n00:15:13.384 --> 00:15:15.390\nby simply putting a filter behind them.\n\n00:15:17.852 --> 00:15:21.823\nNow you can see that changes the light\nthat's coming through there, right?\n\n00:15:21.847 --> 00:15:24.928\nBecause now the light is going\nthrough a yellowish filter\n\n00:15:24.952 --> 00:15:26.499\nand then a purplish filter.\n\n00:15:26.523 --> 00:15:30.834\nI'm going to do the opposite\non the left here.\n\n00:15:30.858 --> 00:15:36.525\nI'm going to put the middle nine\nunder a purplish light.\n\n00:15:37.958 --> 00:15:42.495\nNow, some of you will have noticed\nthat the consequence\n\n00:15:42.519 --> 00:15:45.582\nis that the light coming through those\nmiddle nine on the right,\n\n00:15:45.606 --> 00:15:48.414\nor your left, is exactly\nthe same as the light\n\n00:15:48.438 --> 00:15:51.130\ncoming through the middle\nnine on your right.\n\n00:15:51.154 --> 00:15:53.739\nAgreed? Yes?\n\n00:15:53.763 --> 00:15:56.312\nOkay. So they are physically the same.\n\n00:15:56.336 --> 00:15:58.974\nLet's pull the covers off.\n\n00:16:01.958 --> 00:16:03.299\nNow remember --\n\n00:16:05.662 --> 00:16:09.381\nyou know that the middle nine\nare exactly the same.\n\n00:16:09.405 --> 00:16:10.624\nDo they look the same?\n\n00:16:12.260 --> 00:16:13.415\nNo.\n\n00:16:13.439 --> 00:16:15.394\nThe question is, \"Is that an illusion?\"\n\n00:16:15.418 --> 00:16:16.825\nAnd I'll leave you with that.\n\n00:16:16.849 --> 00:16:18.054\nSo, thank you very much.\n\n00:16:18.078 --> 00:16:19.243\n(Laughter)\n\n00:16:19.267 --> 00:16:21.958\n(Applause)"}, {"title": "Claim your \"manspace\"", "duration": "267", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/sam_martin_builds_a_room_of_his_own", "transcript": "So, I am indeed going to talk about the spaces men create for themselves, but first I want to tell you why I'm here. I'm here for two reasons. These two guys are my two sons Ford and Wren. When Ford was about three years old, we shared a very small room together, in a very small space. My office was on one half of the bedroom, and his bedroom was on the other half. And you can imagine, if you're a writer, that things would get really crowded around deadlines.So when Wren was on the way, I realized I needed to find a space of my own. There was no more space in the house. So I went out to the backyard, and without any previous building experience, and about 3,000 dollars and some recycled materials, I built this space. It had everything I needed. It was quiet. There was enough space. And I had control, which was very important.As I was building this space, I thought to myself, \"Surely I'm not the only guy to have to have carved out a space for his own.\" So I did some research. And I found that there was an historic precedence. Hemingway had his writing space. Elvis had two or three manspaces, which is pretty unique because he lived with both his wife and his mother in Graceland. In the popular culture, Superman had the Fortress of Solitude, and there was, of course, the Batcave.So I realized then that I wanted to go out on a journey and see what guys were creating for themselves now. Here is one of the first spaces I found. It is in Austin, Texas, which is where I'm from. On the outside it looks like a very typical garage, a nice garage. But on the inside, it's anything but. And this, to me, is a pretty classic manspace. It has neon concert posters, a bar and, of course, the leg lamp, which is very important.I soon realized that manspaces didn't have to be only inside. This guy built a bowling alley in his backyard, out of landscaping timbers, astroturf. And he found the scoreboard in the trash.Here's another outdoor space, a little bit more sophisticated. This a 1923 wooden tugboat, made completely out of Douglas fir. The guy did it all himself. And there is about 1,000 square feet of hanging-out space inside.So, pretty early on in my investigations I realized what I was finding was not what I expected to find, which was, quite frankly, a lot of beer can pyramids and overstuffed couches and flat-screen TVs. There were definitely hang-out spots. But some were for working, some were for playing, some were for guys to collect their things. Most of all, I was just surprised with what I was finding.Take this place for example. On the outside it looks like a typical northeastern garage. This is in Long Island, New York. The only thing that might tip you off is the round window. On the inside it's a recreation of a 16th century Japanese tea house. The man imported all the materials from Japan, and he hired a Japanese carpenter to build it in the traditional style. It has no nails or screws. All the joints are hand-carved and hand-scribed.Here is another pretty typical scene. This is a suburban Las Vegas neighborhood. But you open one of the garage doors and there is a professional-size boxing ring inside. (Laughter) And so there is a good reason for this. It was built by this man who is Wayne McCullough. He won the silver medal for Ireland in the 1992 Olympics, and he trains in this space. He trains other people. And right off the garage he has his own trophy room where he can sort of bask in his accomplishments, which is another sort of important part about a manspace.So, while this space represents someone's profession, this one certainly represents a passion. It's made to look like the inside of an English sailing ship. It's a collection of nautical antiques from the 1700s and 1800s. Museum quality.So, as I came to the end of my journey, I found over 50 spaces. And they were unexpected and they were surprising. But they were also \u2014 I was really impressed by how personalized they were, and how much work went into them. And I realized that's because the guys that I met were all very passionate about what they did. And they really loved their professions. And they were very passionate about their collections and their hobbies. And so they created these spaces to reflect what they love to do, and who they were.So if you don't have a space of your own, I highly recommend finding one, and getting into it. Thank you very much.

Cities, past and future. In Oxford, perhaps we can use Lewis Carroll and look in the looking glass that is New York City to try and see our true selves, or perhaps pass through to another world. Or, in the words of F. Scott Fitzgerald, \"As the moon rose higher, the inessential houses began to melt away until gradually I became aware of the old island here that once flowered for Dutch sailors' eyes, a fresh green breast of the new world.\"My colleagues and I have been working for 10 years to rediscover this lost world in a project we call The Mannahatta Project. We're trying to discover what Henry Hudson would have seen on the afternoon of September 12th, 1609, when he sailed into New York harbor. And I'd like to tell you the story in three acts, and if I have time still, an epilogue.So, Act I: A Map Found. So, I didn't grow up in New York. I grew up out west in the Sierra Nevada Mountains, like you see here, in the Red Rock Canyon. And from these early experiences as a child I learned to love landscapes. And so when it became time for me to do my graduate studies, I studied this emerging field of landscape ecology. Landscape ecology concerns itself with how the stream and the meadow and the forest and the cliffs make habitats for plants and animals. This experience and this training lead me to get a wonderful job with the Wildlife Conservation Society, which works to save wildlife and wild places all over the world. And over the last decade, I traveled to over 40 countries to see jaguars and bears and elephants and tigers and rhinos.But every time I would return from my trips I'd return back to New York City. And on my weekends I would go up, just like all the other tourists, to the top of the Empire State Building, and I'd look down on this landscape, on these ecosystems, and I'd wonder, \"How does this landscape work to make habitat for plants and animals? How does it work to make habitat for animals like me?\" I'd go to Times Square and I'd look at the amazing ladies on the wall, and wonder why nobody is looking at the historical figures just behind them. I'd go to Central Park and see the rolling topography of Central Park come up against the abrupt and sheer topography of midtown Manhattan.I started reading about the history and the geography in New York City. I read that New York City was the first mega-city, a city of 10 million people or more, in 1950. I started seeing paintings like this. For those of you who are from New York, this is 125th street under the West Side Highway. (Laughter) It was once a beach. And this painting has John James Audubon, the painter, sitting on the rock. And it's looking up on the wooded heights of Washington Heights to Jeffrey's Hook, where the George Washington Bridge goes across today.Or this painting, from the 1740s, from Greenwich Village. Those are two students at King's College \u2014 later Columbia University \u2014 sitting on a hill, overlooking a valley. And so I'd go down to Greenwich Village and I'd look for this hill, and I couldn't find it. And I couldn't find that palm tree. What's that palm tree doing there? (Laughter)So, it was in the course of these investigations that I ran into a map. And it's this map you see here. It's held in a geographic information system which allows me to zoom in. This map isn't from Hudson's time, but from the American Revolution, 170 years later, made by British military cartographers during the occupation of New York City. And it's a remarkable map. It's in the National Archives here in Kew. And it's 10 feet long and three and a half feet wide.And if I zoom in to lower Manhattan you can see the extent of New York City as it was, right at the end of the American Revolution. Here's Bowling Green. And here's Broadway. And this is City Hall Park. So the city basically extended to City Hall Park. And just beyond it you can see features that have vanished, things that have disappeared. This is the Collect Pond, which was the fresh water source for New York City for its first 200 years, and for the Native Americans for thousands of years before that. You can see the Lispenard Meadows draining down through here, through what is TriBeCa now, and the beaches that come up from the Battery, all the way to 42nd St.This map was made for military reasons. They're mapping the roads, the buildings, these fortifications that they built. But they're also mapping things of ecological interest, also military interest: the hills, the marshes, the streams. This is Richmond Hill, and Minetta Water, which used to run its way through Greenwich Village. Or the swamp at Gramercy Park, right here. Or Murray Hill. And this is the Murrays' house on Murray Hill, 200 years ago. Here is Times Square, the two streams that came together to make a wetland in Times Square, as it was at the end of the American Revolution.So I saw this remarkable map in a book. And I thought to myself, \"You know, if I could georeference this map, if I could place this map in the grid of the city today, I could find these lost features of the city, in the block-by-block geography that people know, the geography of where people go to work, and where they go to live, and where they like to eat.\" So, after some work we were able to georeference it, which allows us to put the modern streets on the city, and the buildings, and the open spaces, so that we can zoom in to where the Collect Pond is. We can digitize the Collect Pond and the streams, and see where they actually are in the geography of the city today. So this is fun for finding where things are relative to the old topography.But I had another idea about this map. If we take away the streets, and if we take away the buildings, and if we take away the open spaces, then we could take this map. If we pull off the 18th century features we could drive it back in time. We could drive it back to its ecological fundamentals: to the hills, to the streams, to the basic hydrology and shoreline, to the beaches, the basic aspects that make the ecological landscape.Then, if we added maps like the geology, the bedrock geology, and the surface geology, what the glaciers leave, if we make the soil map, with the 17 soil classes, that are defined by the National Conservation Service, if we make a digital elevation model of the topography that tells us how high the hills were, then we can calculate the slopes. We can calculate the aspect. We can calculate the winter wind exposure \u2014 so, which way the winter winds blow across the landscape. The white areas on this map are the places protected from the winter winds.We compiled all the information about where the Native Americans were, the Lenape. And we built a probability map of where they might have been. So, the red areas on this map indicate the places that are best for human sustainability on Manhattan, places that are close to water, places that are near the harbor to fish, places protected from the winter winds. We know that there was a Lenape settlement down here by the Collect Pond. And we knew that they planted a kind of horticulture, that they grew these beautiful gardens of corn, beans, and squash, the \"Three Sisters\" garden.So, we built a model that explains where those fields might have been. And the old fields, the successional fields that go. And we might think of these as abandoned. But, in fact, they're grassland habitats for grassland birds and plants. And they have become successional shrub lands, and these then mix in to a map of all the ecological communities. And it turns out that Manhattan had 55 different ecosystem types. You can think of these as neighborhoods, as distinctive as TriBeCa and the Upper East Side and Inwood \u2014 that these are the forest and the wetlands and the marine communities, the beaches.And 55 is a lot. On a per-area basis, Manhattan had more ecological communities per acre than Yosemite does, than Yellowstone, than Amboseli. It was really an extraordinary landscape that was capable of supporting an extraordinary biodiversity.So, Act II: A Home Reconstructed. So, we studied the fish and the frogs and the birds and the bees, the 85 different kinds of fish that were on Manhattan, the Heath hens, the species that aren't there anymore, the beavers on all the streams, the black bears, and the Native Americans, to study how they used and thought about their landscape. We wanted to try and map these. And to do that what we did was we mapped their habitat needs.Where do they get their food? Where do they get their water? Where do they get their shelter? Where do they get their reproductive resources? To an ecologist, the intersection of these is habitat, but to most people, the intersection of these is their home. So, we would read in field guides, the standard field guides that maybe you have on your shelves, you know, what beavers need is, \"A slowly meandering stream with aspen trees and alders and willows, near the water.\" That's the best thing for a beaver.So we just started making a list. Here is the beaver. And here is the stream, and the aspen and the alder and the willow. As if these were the maps that we would need to predict where you would find the beaver. Or the bog turtle, needing wet meadows and insects and sunny places. Or the bobcat, needing rabbits and beavers and den sites. And rapidly we started to realize that beavers can be something that a bobcat needs. But a beaver also needs things. And that having it on either side means that we can link it together, that we can create the network of the habitat relationships for these species.Moreover, we realized that you can start out as being a beaver specialist, but you can look up what an aspen needs. An aspen needs fire and dry soils. And you can look at what a wet meadow needs. And it need beavers to create the wetlands, and maybe some other things. But you can also talk about sunny places. So, what does a sunny place need? Not habitat per se. But what are the conditions that make it possible? Or fire. Or dry soils. And that you can put these on a grid that's 1,000 columns long across the top and 1,000 rows down the other way. And then we can visualize this data like a network, like a social network.And this is the network of all the habitat relationships of all the plants and animals on Manhattan, and everything they needed, going back to the geology, going back to time and space at the very core of the web. We call this the Muir Web. And if you zoom in on it it looks like this. Each point is a different species or a different stream or a different soil type. And those little gray lines are the connections that connect them together. They are the connections that actually make nature resilient. And the structure of this is what makes nature work, seen with all its parts. We call these Muir Webs after the Scottish-American naturalist John Muir, who said, \"When we try to pick out anything by itself, we find that it's bound fast by a thousand invisible cords that cannot be broken, to everything in the universe.\"So then we took the Muir webs and we took them back to the maps. So if we wanted to go between 85th and 86th, and Lex and Third, maybe there was a stream in that block. And these would be the kind of trees that might have been there, and the flowers and the lichens and the mosses, the butterflies, the fish in the stream, the birds in the trees. Maybe a timber rattlesnake lived there. And perhaps a black bear walked by. And maybe Native Americans were there. And then we took this data.You can see this for yourself on our website. You can zoom into any block on Manhattan, and see what might have been there 400 years ago. And we used it to try and reveal a landscape here in Act III. We used the tools they use in Hollywood to make these fantastic landscapes that we all see in the movies.And we tried to use it to visualize Third Avenue. So we would take the landscape and we would build up the topography. We'd lay on top of that the soils and the waters, and illuminate the landscape. We would lay on top of that the map of the ecological communities. And feed into that the map of the species. So that we would actually take a photograph, flying above Times Square, looking toward the Hudson River, waiting for Hudson to come. Using this technology, we can make these fantastic georeferenced views. We can basically take a picture out of any window on Manhattan and see what that landscape looked like 400 years ago.This is the view from the East River, looking up Murray Hill at where the United Nations is today. This is the view looking down the Hudson River, with Manhattan on the left, and New Jersey out on the right, looking out toward the Atlantic Ocean. This is the view over Times Square, with the beaver pond there, looking out toward the east. So we can see the Collect Pond, and Lispenard Marshes back behind. We can see the fields that the Native Americans made. And we can see this in the geography of the city today. So when you're watching \"Law and Order,\" and the lawyers walk up the steps they could have walked back down those steps of the New York Court House, right into the Collect Pond, 400 years ago.So these images are the work of my friend and colleague, Mark Boyer, who is here in the audience today. And I'd just like, if you would give him a hand, to call out for his fine work. (Applause)There is such power in bringing science and visualization together, that we can create images like this, perhaps looking on either side of a looking glass. And even though I've only had a brief time to speak, I hope you appreciate that Mannahatta was a very special place. The place that you see here on the left side was interconnected. It was based on this diversity. It had this resilience that is what we need in our modern world.But I wouldn't have you think that I don't like the place on the right, which I quite do. I've come to love the city and its kind of diversity, and its resilience, and its dependence on density and how we're connected together. In fact, that I see them as reflections of each other, much as Lewis Carroll did in \"Through the Looking Glass.\" We can compare these two and hold them in our minds at the same time, that they really are the same place, that there is no way that cities can escape from nature. And I think this is what we're learning about building cities in the future.So if you'll allow me a brief epilogue, not about the past, but about 400 years from now, what we're realizing is that cities are habitats for people, and need to supply what people need: a sense of home, food, water, shelter, reproductive resources, and a sense of meaning. This is the particular additional habitat requirement of humanity. And so many of the talks here at TED are about meaning, about bringing meaning to our lives in all kinds of different ways, through technology, through art, through science, so much so that I think we focus so much on that side of our lives, that we haven't given enough attention to the food and the water and the shelter, and what we need to raise the kids.So, how can we envision the city of the future? Well, what if we go to Madison Square Park, and we imagine it without all the cars, and bicycles instead and large forests, and streams instead of sewers and storm drains? What if we imagined the Upper East Side with green roofs, and streams winding through the city, and windmills supplying the power we need? Or if we imagine the New York City metropolitan area, currently home to 12 million people, but 12 million people in the future, perhaps living at the density of Manhattan, in only 36 percent of the area, with the areas in between covered by farmland, covered by wetlands, covered by the marshes we need.This is the kind of future I think we need, is a future that has the same diversity and abundance and dynamism of Manhattan, but that learns from the sustainability of the past, of the ecology, the original ecology, of nature with all its parts. Thank you very much.

00:01:07.958\nand if I have time still, an epilogue.\n\n00:01:07.958 --> 00:01:09.958\nSo, Act I: A Map Found.\n\n00:01:09.958 --> 00:01:11.958\nSo, I didn't grow up in New York.\n\n00:01:11.958 --> 00:01:14.958\nI grew up out west in the\nSierra Nevada Mountains, like you see here,\n\n00:01:14.958 --> 00:01:16.958\nin the Red Rock Canyon.\n\n00:01:16.958 --> 00:01:18.958\nAnd from these early\nexperiences as a child\n\n00:01:18.958 --> 00:01:20.958\nI learned to love landscapes.\n\n00:01:20.958 --> 00:01:22.958\nAnd so when it became time\nfor me to do my graduate studies,\n\n00:01:22.958 --> 00:01:26.958\nI studied this emerging field\nof landscape ecology.\n\n00:01:26.958 --> 00:01:28.958\nLandscape ecology concerns itself\n\n00:01:28.958 --> 00:01:32.958\nwith how the stream and the meadow\nand the forest and the cliffs\n\n00:01:32.958 --> 00:01:34.958\nmake habitats for plants and animals.\n\n00:01:34.958 --> 00:01:36.958\nThis experience and this training\n\n00:01:36.958 --> 00:01:39.958\nlead me to get a wonderful job\nwith the Wildlife Conservation Society,\n\n00:01:39.958 --> 00:01:42.958\nwhich works to save wildlife\nand wild places all over the world.\n\n00:01:42.958 --> 00:01:44.958\nAnd over the last decade,\n\n00:01:44.958 --> 00:01:46.958\nI traveled to over 40 countries\n\n00:01:46.958 --> 00:01:48.958\nto see jaguars and bears and elephants\n\n00:01:48.958 --> 00:01:50.958\nand tigers and rhinos.\n\n00:01:50.958 --> 00:01:53.958\nBut every time I would return\nfrom my trips I'd return back to New York City.\n\n00:01:53.958 --> 00:01:56.958\nAnd on my weekends I would go up,\njust like all the other tourists,\n\n00:01:56.958 --> 00:01:58.958\nto the top of the Empire State Building,\n\n00:01:58.958 --> 00:02:01.958\nand I'd look down on this landscape,\non these ecosystems,\n\n00:02:01.958 --> 00:02:03.958\nand I'd wonder, \"How does this landscape\n\n00:02:03.958 --> 00:02:05.958\nwork to make habitat\nfor plants and animals?\n\n00:02:05.958 --> 00:02:09.958\nHow does it work to make habitat\nfor animals like me?\"\n\n00:02:09.958 --> 00:02:13.958\nI'd go to Times Square and I'd look\nat the amazing ladies on the wall,\n\n00:02:13.958 --> 00:02:18.958\nand wonder why nobody is looking\nat the historical figures just behind them.\n\n00:02:18.958 --> 00:02:21.958\nI'd go to Central Park and see\nthe rolling topography of Central Park\n\n00:02:21.958 --> 00:02:23.958\ncome up against the abrupt and sheer\n\n00:02:23.958 --> 00:02:27.958\ntopography of midtown Manhattan.\n\n00:02:27.958 --> 00:02:30.958\nI started reading about the history\nand the geography in New York City.\n\n00:02:30.958 --> 00:02:32.958\nI read that New York City\nwas the first mega-city,\n\n00:02:32.958 --> 00:02:36.958\na city of 10 million people\nor more, in 1950.\n\n00:02:36.958 --> 00:02:38.958\nI started seeing paintings like this.\n\n00:02:38.958 --> 00:02:40.958\nFor those of you who are from New York,\n\n00:02:40.958 --> 00:02:43.958\nthis is 125th street\nunder the West Side Highway.\n\n00:02:43.958 --> 00:02:45.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:02:45.958 --> 00:02:47.958\nIt was once a beach.\nAnd this painting\n\n00:02:47.958 --> 00:02:50.958\nhas John James Audubon,\nthe painter, sitting on the rock.\n\n00:02:50.958 --> 00:02:52.958\nAnd it's looking up on the wooded heights\nof Washington Heights\n\n00:02:52.958 --> 00:02:56.958\nto Jeffrey's Hook, where the George\nWashington Bridge goes across today.\n\n00:02:56.958 --> 00:02:59.958\nOr this painting, from the 1740s,\nfrom Greenwich Village.\n\n00:02:59.958 --> 00:03:02.958\nThose are two students at King's College --\nlater Columbia University --\n\n00:03:02.958 --> 00:03:05.958\nsitting on a hill, overlooking a valley.\n\n00:03:05.958 --> 00:03:08.958\nAnd so I'd go down to Greenwich\nVillage and I'd look for this hill,\n\n00:03:08.958 --> 00:03:11.958\nand I couldn't find it.\nAnd I couldn't find that palm tree.\n\n00:03:11.958 --> 00:03:13.958\nWhat's that palm tree doing there?\n\n00:03:13.958 --> 00:03:14.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:03:14.958 --> 00:03:17.958\nSo, it was in the course of these investigations\nthat I ran into a map.\n\n00:03:17.958 --> 00:03:19.958\nAnd it's this map you see here.\n\n00:03:19.958 --> 00:03:21.958\nIt's held in a geographic information system\n\n00:03:21.958 --> 00:03:23.958\nwhich allows me to zoom in.\n\n00:03:23.958 --> 00:03:26.958\nThis map isn't from Hudson's time,\nbut from the American Revolution,\n\n00:03:26.958 --> 00:03:30.958\n170 years later, made by\nBritish military cartographers\n\n00:03:30.958 --> 00:03:32.958\nduring the occupation of New York City.\n\n00:03:32.958 --> 00:03:36.958\nAnd it's a remarkable map.\nIt's in the National Archives here in Kew.\n\n00:03:36.958 --> 00:03:38.958\nAnd it's 10 feet long and\nthree and a half feet wide.\n\n00:03:38.958 --> 00:03:41.958\nAnd if I zoom in to lower Manhattan\n\n00:03:41.958 --> 00:03:43.958\nyou can see the extent\nof New York City as it was,\n\n00:03:43.958 --> 00:03:45.958\nright at the end of the American Revolution.\n\n00:03:45.958 --> 00:03:48.958\nHere's Bowling Green.\nAnd here's Broadway.\n\n00:03:48.958 --> 00:03:50.958\nAnd this is City Hall Park.\n\n00:03:50.958 --> 00:03:53.958\nSo the city basically extended\nto City Hall Park.\n\n00:03:53.958 --> 00:03:55.958\nAnd just beyond it you can see features\n\n00:03:55.958 --> 00:03:57.958\nthat have vanished,\nthings that have disappeared.\n\n00:03:57.958 --> 00:04:00.958\nThis is the Collect Pond, which was\nthe fresh water source for New York City\n\n00:04:00.958 --> 00:04:02.958\nfor its first 200 years,\n\n00:04:02.958 --> 00:04:05.958\nand for the Native Americans\nfor thousands of years before that.\n\n00:04:05.958 --> 00:04:07.958\nYou can see the Lispenard Meadows\n\n00:04:07.958 --> 00:04:09.958\ndraining down through here,\nthrough what is TriBeCa now,\n\n00:04:09.958 --> 00:04:11.958\nand the beaches that\ncome up from the Battery,\n\n00:04:11.958 --> 00:04:13.958\nall the way to 42nd St.\n\n00:04:13.958 --> 00:04:16.958\nThis map was made for military reasons.\n\n00:04:16.958 --> 00:04:18.958\nThey're mapping the roads,\nthe buildings, these fortifications\n\n00:04:18.958 --> 00:04:20.958\nthat they built.\n\n00:04:20.958 --> 00:04:22.958\nBut they're also mapping\nthings of ecological interest,\n\n00:04:22.958 --> 00:04:24.958\nalso military interest: the hills,\n\n00:04:24.958 --> 00:04:27.958\nthe marshes, the streams.\n\n00:04:27.958 --> 00:04:29.958\nThis is Richmond Hill,\nand Minetta Water,\n\n00:04:29.958 --> 00:04:32.958\nwhich used to run its way\nthrough Greenwich Village.\n\n00:04:32.958 --> 00:04:37.958\nOr the swamp at Gramercy Park, right here.\n\n00:04:37.958 --> 00:04:39.958\nOr Murray Hill.\nAnd this is the Murrays' house\n\n00:04:39.958 --> 00:04:42.958\non Murray Hill, 200 years ago.\n\n00:04:42.958 --> 00:04:45.958\nHere is Times Square,\n\n00:04:45.958 --> 00:04:47.958\nthe two streams that came\ntogether to make a wetland\n\n00:04:47.958 --> 00:04:52.958\nin Times Square, as it was\nat the end of the American Revolution.\n\n00:04:52.958 --> 00:04:54.958\nSo I saw this remarkable map in a book.\n\n00:04:54.958 --> 00:04:58.958\nAnd I thought to myself, \"You know,\nif I could georeference this map,\n\n00:04:58.958 --> 00:05:01.958\nif I could place this map\nin the grid of the city today,\n\n00:05:01.958 --> 00:05:03.958\nI could find these lost features\n\n00:05:03.958 --> 00:05:05.958\nof the city,\n\n00:05:05.958 --> 00:05:08.958\nin the block-by-block\ngeography that people know,\n\n00:05:08.958 --> 00:05:11.958\nthe geography of where people\ngo to work, and where they go to live,\n\n00:05:11.958 --> 00:05:13.958\nand where they like to eat.\"\n\n00:05:13.958 --> 00:05:15.958\nSo, after some work\nwe were able to georeference it,\n\n00:05:15.958 --> 00:05:18.958\nwhich allows us to put\nthe modern streets on the city,\n\n00:05:18.958 --> 00:05:23.958\nand the buildings, and the open spaces,\n\n00:05:23.958 --> 00:05:28.958\nso that we can zoom in\nto where the Collect Pond is.\n\n00:05:28.958 --> 00:05:32.958\nWe can digitize the Collect\nPond and the streams,\n\n00:05:32.958 --> 00:05:37.958\nand see where they actually are\nin the geography of the city today.\n\n00:05:37.958 --> 00:05:40.958\nSo this is fun\nfor finding where things are\n\n00:05:40.958 --> 00:05:45.958\nrelative to the old topography.\n\n00:05:45.958 --> 00:05:47.958\nBut I had another idea about this map.\n\n00:05:47.958 --> 00:05:50.958\nIf we take away the streets,\nand if we take away the buildings,\n\n00:05:50.958 --> 00:05:52.958\nand if we take away the open spaces,\n\n00:05:52.958 --> 00:05:54.958\nthen we could take this map.\n\n00:05:54.958 --> 00:05:56.958\nIf we pull off the 18th century features\n\n00:05:56.958 --> 00:05:58.958\nwe could drive it back in time.\n\n00:05:58.958 --> 00:06:02.958\nWe could drive it back\nto its ecological fundamentals:\n\n00:06:02.958 --> 00:06:04.958\nto the hills, to the streams,\n\n00:06:04.958 --> 00:06:08.958\nto the basic hydrology\nand shoreline, to the beaches,\n\n00:06:08.958 --> 00:06:12.958\nthe basic aspects that\nmake the ecological landscape.\n\n00:06:12.958 --> 00:06:15.958\nThen, if we added maps\nlike the geology, the bedrock geology,\n\n00:06:15.958 --> 00:06:18.958\nand the surface geology,\nwhat the glaciers leave,\n\n00:06:18.958 --> 00:06:20.958\nif we make the soil map,\n\n00:06:20.958 --> 00:06:23.958\nwith the 17 soil classes,\n\n00:06:23.958 --> 00:06:26.958\nthat are defined by\nthe National Conservation Service,\n\n00:06:26.958 --> 00:06:28.958\nif we make a digital elevation model\n\n00:06:28.958 --> 00:06:31.958\nof the topography\nthat tells us how high the hills were,\n\n00:06:31.958 --> 00:06:34.958\nthen we can calculate the slopes.\n\n00:06:34.958 --> 00:06:37.958\nWe can calculate the aspect.\n\n00:06:37.958 --> 00:06:39.958\nWe can calculate the\nwinter wind exposure --\n\n00:06:39.958 --> 00:06:41.958\nso, which way the winter\nwinds blow across the landscape.\n\n00:06:41.958 --> 00:06:46.958\nThe white areas on this map\nare the places protected from the winter winds.\n\n00:06:46.958 --> 00:06:49.958\nWe compiled all the information\nabout where the Native Americans were, the Lenape.\n\n00:06:49.958 --> 00:06:53.958\nAnd we built a probability map\nof where they might have been.\n\n00:06:53.958 --> 00:06:55.958\nSo, the red areas\non this map indicate the places\n\n00:06:55.958 --> 00:06:57.958\nthat are best for human\nsustainability on Manhattan,\n\n00:06:57.958 --> 00:06:59.958\nplaces that are close to water,\n\n00:06:59.958 --> 00:07:01.958\nplaces that are near the harbor to fish,\n\n00:07:01.958 --> 00:07:06.958\nplaces protected from the winter winds.\n\n00:07:06.958 --> 00:07:08.958\nWe know that there was a Lenape settlement\n\n00:07:08.958 --> 00:07:11.958\ndown here by the Collect Pond.\n\n00:07:11.958 --> 00:07:13.958\nAnd we knew that they\nplanted a kind of horticulture,\n\n00:07:13.958 --> 00:07:16.958\nthat they grew these beautiful gardens\nof corn, beans, and squash,\n\n00:07:16.958 --> 00:07:18.958\nthe \"Three Sisters\" garden.\n\n00:07:18.958 --> 00:07:22.958\nSo, we built a model that explains\nwhere those fields might have been.\n\n00:07:22.958 --> 00:07:24.958\nAnd the old fields, the successional fields that go.\n\n00:07:24.958 --> 00:07:26.958\nAnd we might think of these as abandoned.\n\n00:07:26.958 --> 00:07:28.958\nBut, in fact, they're grassland habitats\n\n00:07:28.958 --> 00:07:30.958\nfor grassland birds and plants.\n\n00:07:30.958 --> 00:07:33.958\nAnd they have become\nsuccessional shrub lands,\n\n00:07:33.958 --> 00:07:37.958\nand these then mix in\nto a map of all the ecological communities.\n\n00:07:37.958 --> 00:07:41.958\nAnd it turns out that Manhattan\nhad 55 different ecosystem types.\n\n00:07:41.958 --> 00:07:43.958\nYou can think of these as neighborhoods,\n\n00:07:43.958 --> 00:07:48.958\nas distinctive as TriBeCa\nand the Upper East Side and Inwood --\n\n00:07:48.958 --> 00:07:50.958\nthat these are the forest and the wetlands\n\n00:07:50.958 --> 00:07:53.958\nand the marine communities, the beaches.\n\n00:07:53.958 --> 00:07:56.958\nAnd 55 is a lot. On a per-area basis,\n\n00:07:56.958 --> 00:07:58.958\nManhattan had more ecological communities\n\n00:07:58.958 --> 00:08:00.958\nper acre than Yosemite does,\n\n00:08:00.958 --> 00:08:03.958\nthan Yellowstone, than Amboseli.\n\n00:08:03.958 --> 00:08:05.958\nIt was really an extraordinary landscape\n\n00:08:05.958 --> 00:08:09.958\nthat was capable of supporting\nan extraordinary biodiversity.\n\n00:08:09.958 --> 00:08:13.958\nSo, Act II: A Home Reconstructed.\n\n00:08:13.958 --> 00:08:17.958\nSo, we studied the fish and the frogs\nand the birds and the bees,\n\n00:08:17.958 --> 00:08:20.958\nthe 85 different kinds of fish\nthat were on Manhattan,\n\n00:08:20.958 --> 00:08:24.958\nthe Heath hens, the species\nthat aren't there anymore,\n\n00:08:24.958 --> 00:08:27.958\nthe beavers on all the streams,\nthe black bears,\n\n00:08:27.958 --> 00:08:30.958\nand the Native Americans,\nto study how they used\n\n00:08:30.958 --> 00:08:32.958\nand thought about their landscape.\n\n00:08:32.958 --> 00:08:35.958\nWe wanted to try and map these.\nAnd to do that what we did\n\n00:08:35.958 --> 00:08:37.958\nwas we mapped their habitat needs.\n\n00:08:37.958 --> 00:08:39.958\nWhere do they get their food?\n\n00:08:39.958 --> 00:08:41.958\nWhere do they get their water?\nWhere do they get their shelter?\n\n00:08:41.958 --> 00:08:44.958\nWhere do they get their\nreproductive resources?\n\n00:08:44.958 --> 00:08:47.958\nTo an ecologist, the intersection\nof these is habitat,\n\n00:08:47.958 --> 00:08:52.958\nbut to most people,\nthe intersection of these is their home.\n\n00:08:52.958 --> 00:08:54.958\nSo, we would read in field guides,\nthe standard field guides\n\n00:08:54.958 --> 00:08:56.958\nthat maybe you have on your shelves,\n\n00:08:56.958 --> 00:08:58.958\nyou know, what beavers need is,\n\"A slowly meandering stream\n\n00:08:58.958 --> 00:09:01.958\nwith aspen trees and alders and willows,\n\n00:09:01.958 --> 00:09:03.958\nnear the water.\"\nThat's the best thing for a beaver.\n\n00:09:03.958 --> 00:09:05.958\nSo we just started making a list.\n\n00:09:05.958 --> 00:09:07.958\nHere is the beaver.\nAnd here is the stream,\n\n00:09:07.958 --> 00:09:09.958\nand the aspen and the alder\nand the willow.\n\n00:09:09.958 --> 00:09:11.958\nAs if these were the maps\nthat we would need\n\n00:09:11.958 --> 00:09:13.958\nto predict where you would find the beaver.\n\n00:09:13.958 --> 00:09:17.958\nOr the bog turtle, needing wet meadows\nand insects and sunny places.\n\n00:09:17.958 --> 00:09:21.958\nOr the bobcat, needing rabbits\nand beavers and den sites.\n\n00:09:21.958 --> 00:09:24.958\nAnd rapidly we started to realize\nthat beavers can be\n\n00:09:24.958 --> 00:09:27.958\nsomething that a bobcat needs.\n\n00:09:27.958 --> 00:09:29.958\nBut a beaver also needs things.\nAnd that having it\n\n00:09:29.958 --> 00:09:31.958\non either side means that\nwe can link it together,\n\n00:09:31.958 --> 00:09:33.958\nthat we can create the network\n\n00:09:33.958 --> 00:09:36.958\nof the habitat relationships\nfor these species.\n\n00:09:36.958 --> 00:09:38.958\nMoreover, we realized\nthat you can start out\n\n00:09:38.958 --> 00:09:40.958\nas being a beaver specialist,\n\n00:09:40.958 --> 00:09:42.958\nbut you can look up what an aspen needs.\n\n00:09:42.958 --> 00:09:45.958\nAn aspen needs fire and dry soils.\n\n00:09:45.958 --> 00:09:48.958\nAnd you can look at\nwhat a wet meadow needs.\n\n00:09:48.958 --> 00:09:50.958\nAnd it need beavers\nto create the wetlands,\n\n00:09:50.958 --> 00:09:52.958\nand maybe some other things.\n\n00:09:52.958 --> 00:09:54.958\nBut you can also talk\nabout sunny places.\n\n00:09:54.958 --> 00:09:57.958\nSo, what does a sunny place need?\nNot habitat per se.\n\n00:09:57.958 --> 00:09:59.958\nBut what are the conditions\nthat make it possible?\n\n00:09:59.958 --> 00:10:02.958\nOr fire. Or dry soils.\n\n00:10:02.958 --> 00:10:05.958\nAnd that you can put these\non a grid that's 1,000 columns long\n\n00:10:05.958 --> 00:10:08.958\nacross the top and 1,000 rows\ndown the other way.\n\n00:10:08.958 --> 00:10:11.958\nAnd then we can visualize\nthis data like a network,\n\n00:10:11.958 --> 00:10:13.958\nlike a social network.\n\n00:10:13.958 --> 00:10:15.958\nAnd this is the network\nof all the habitat relationships\n\n00:10:15.958 --> 00:10:17.958\nof all the plants and animals\non Manhattan,\n\n00:10:17.958 --> 00:10:19.958\nand everything they needed,\n\n00:10:19.958 --> 00:10:21.958\ngoing back to the geology,\n\n00:10:21.958 --> 00:10:24.958\ngoing back to time and space\nat the very core of the web.\n\n00:10:24.958 --> 00:10:27.958\nWe call this the Muir Web.\nAnd if you zoom in on it it looks like this.\n\n00:10:27.958 --> 00:10:29.958\nEach point is a different species\n\n00:10:29.958 --> 00:10:32.958\nor a different stream\nor a different soil type.\n\n00:10:32.958 --> 00:10:35.958\nAnd those little gray lines are the connections\nthat connect them together.\n\n00:10:35.958 --> 00:10:38.958\nThey are the connections\nthat actually make nature resilient.\n\n00:10:38.958 --> 00:10:42.958\nAnd the structure of this\nis what makes nature work,\n\n00:10:42.958 --> 00:10:44.958\nseen with all its parts.\n\n00:10:44.958 --> 00:10:47.958\nWe call these Muir Webs\nafter the Scottish-American naturalist\n\n00:10:47.958 --> 00:10:50.958\nJohn Muir, who said, \"When we try\nto pick out anything by itself,\n\n00:10:50.958 --> 00:10:53.958\nwe find that it's bound fast\nby a thousand invisible cords\n\n00:10:53.958 --> 00:10:57.958\nthat cannot be broken,\nto everything in the universe.\"\n\n00:10:57.958 --> 00:11:00.958\nSo then we took the Muir webs\nand we took them back to the maps.\n\n00:11:00.958 --> 00:11:02.958\nSo if we wanted to go between 85th and 86th,\n\n00:11:02.958 --> 00:11:04.958\nand Lex and Third,\n\n00:11:04.958 --> 00:11:06.958\nmaybe there was a stream in that block.\n\n00:11:06.958 --> 00:11:08.958\nAnd these would be the kind of trees\nthat might have been there,\n\n00:11:08.958 --> 00:11:12.958\nand the flowers and the lichens\nand the mosses,\n\n00:11:12.958 --> 00:11:15.958\nthe butterflies, the fish in the stream,\n\n00:11:15.958 --> 00:11:17.958\nthe birds in the trees.\n\n00:11:17.958 --> 00:11:19.958\nMaybe a timber rattlesnake lived there.\n\n00:11:19.958 --> 00:11:22.958\nAnd perhaps a black bear walked by.\nAnd maybe Native Americans were there.\n\n00:11:22.958 --> 00:11:24.958\nAnd then we took this data.\n\n00:11:24.958 --> 00:11:26.958\nYou can see this for yourself\non our website.\n\n00:11:26.958 --> 00:11:28.958\nYou can zoom into\nany block on Manhattan,\n\n00:11:28.958 --> 00:11:31.958\nand see what might have\nbeen there 400 years ago.\n\n00:11:31.958 --> 00:11:34.958\nAnd we used it to try\nand reveal a landscape\n\n00:11:34.958 --> 00:11:36.958\nhere in Act III.\n\n00:11:36.958 --> 00:11:38.958\nWe used the tools they use in Hollywood\n\n00:11:38.958 --> 00:11:41.958\nto make these fantastic landscapes\nthat we all see in the movies.\n\n00:11:41.958 --> 00:11:44.958\nAnd we tried to use it to visualize Third Avenue.\n\n00:11:44.958 --> 00:11:48.958\nSo we would take the landscape\nand we would build up the topography.\n\n00:11:48.958 --> 00:11:52.958\nWe'd lay on top of that the soils and the waters,\nand illuminate the landscape.\n\n00:11:52.958 --> 00:11:55.958\nWe would lay on top of that\nthe map of the ecological communities.\n\n00:11:55.958 --> 00:11:58.958\nAnd feed into that the map of the species.\n\n00:11:58.958 --> 00:12:00.958\nSo that we would actually take a photograph,\n\n00:12:00.958 --> 00:12:02.958\nflying above Times Square,\nlooking toward the Hudson River,\n\n00:12:02.958 --> 00:12:04.958\nwaiting for Hudson to come.\n\n00:12:04.958 --> 00:12:06.958\nUsing this technology, we can make these\n\n00:12:06.958 --> 00:12:08.958\nfantastic georeferenced views.\n\n00:12:08.958 --> 00:12:10.958\nWe can basically take a picture\nout of any window\n\n00:12:10.958 --> 00:12:13.958\non Manhattan and see what that landscape\nlooked like 400 years ago.\n\n00:12:13.958 --> 00:12:16.958\nThis is the view from the East River,\nlooking up Murray Hill\n\n00:12:16.958 --> 00:12:19.958\nat where the United Nations is today.\n\n00:12:19.958 --> 00:12:21.958\nThis is the view looking\ndown the Hudson River,\n\n00:12:21.958 --> 00:12:24.958\nwith Manhattan on the left,\nand New Jersey out on the right,\n\n00:12:24.958 --> 00:12:27.958\nlooking out toward the Atlantic Ocean.\n\n00:12:27.958 --> 00:12:29.958\nThis is the view over Times Square,\n\n00:12:29.958 --> 00:12:33.958\nwith the beaver pond there,\nlooking out toward the east.\n\n00:12:33.958 --> 00:12:37.958\nSo we can see the Collect Pond,\nand Lispenard Marshes back behind.\n\n00:12:37.958 --> 00:12:40.958\nWe can see the fields\nthat the Native Americans made.\n\n00:12:40.958 --> 00:12:44.958\nAnd we can see this\nin the geography of the city today.\n\n00:12:44.958 --> 00:12:47.958\nSo when you're watching \"Law and Order,\"\nand the lawyers walk up the steps\n\n00:12:47.958 --> 00:12:49.958\nthey could have walked\nback down those steps\n\n00:12:49.958 --> 00:12:51.958\nof the New York Court House,\nright into the Collect Pond,\n\n00:12:51.958 --> 00:12:55.958\n400 years ago.\n\n00:12:55.958 --> 00:12:58.958\nSo these images are the work\nof my friend and colleague,\n\n00:12:58.958 --> 00:13:00.958\nMark Boyer, who is here\nin the audience today.\n\n00:13:00.958 --> 00:13:02.958\nAnd I'd just like, if you would\ngive him a hand,\n\n00:13:02.958 --> 00:13:05.958\nto call out for his fine work.\n\n00:13:05.958 --> 00:13:14.958\n(Applause)\n\n00:13:14.958 --> 00:13:17.958\nThere is such power in bringing\nscience and visualization together,\n\n00:13:17.958 --> 00:13:19.958\nthat we can create images like this,\n\n00:13:19.958 --> 00:13:22.958\nperhaps looking on either\nside of a looking glass.\n\n00:13:22.958 --> 00:13:24.958\nAnd even though I've only\nhad a brief time to speak,\n\n00:13:24.958 --> 00:13:27.958\nI hope you appreciate that\nMannahatta was a very special place.\n\n00:13:27.958 --> 00:13:30.958\nThe place that you see here\non the left side\n\n00:13:30.958 --> 00:13:32.958\nwas interconnected.\nIt was based on this diversity.\n\n00:13:32.958 --> 00:13:37.958\nIt had this resilience that is\nwhat we need in our modern world.\n\n00:13:37.958 --> 00:13:40.958\nBut I wouldn't have you think\nthat I don't like the place\n\n00:13:40.958 --> 00:13:43.958\non the right, which I quite do.\nI've come to love the city\n\n00:13:43.958 --> 00:13:45.958\nand its kind of diversity,\nand its resilience,\n\n00:13:45.958 --> 00:13:50.958\nand its dependence on density\nand how we're connected together.\n\n00:13:50.958 --> 00:13:54.958\nIn fact, that I see them\nas reflections of each other,\n\n00:13:54.958 --> 00:13:57.958\nmuch as Lewis Carroll did\nin \"Through the Looking Glass.\"\n\n00:13:57.958 --> 00:14:01.958\nWe can compare these two and hold them\nin our minds at the same time,\n\n00:14:01.958 --> 00:14:03.958\nthat they really are the same place,\n\n00:14:03.958 --> 00:14:06.958\nthat there is no way that cities\ncan escape from nature.\n\n00:14:06.958 --> 00:14:10.958\nAnd I think this is what we're learning\nabout building cities in the future.\n\n00:14:10.958 --> 00:14:13.958\nSo if you'll allow me a brief epilogue,\nnot about the past,\n\n00:14:13.958 --> 00:14:15.958\nbut about 400 years from now,\n\n00:14:15.958 --> 00:14:17.958\nwhat we're realizing is that\n\n00:14:17.958 --> 00:14:19.958\ncities are habitats for people,\n\n00:14:19.958 --> 00:14:21.958\nand need to supply what people need:\n\n00:14:21.958 --> 00:14:24.958\na sense of home, food, water, shelter,\n\n00:14:24.958 --> 00:14:28.958\nreproductive resources,\nand a sense of meaning.\n\n00:14:28.958 --> 00:14:31.958\nThis is the particular additional\nhabitat requirement of humanity.\n\n00:14:31.958 --> 00:14:34.958\nAnd so many of the talks here\nat TED are about meaning,\n\n00:14:34.958 --> 00:14:36.958\nabout bringing meaning to our lives\n\n00:14:36.958 --> 00:14:38.958\nin all kinds of different ways, through technology,\n\n00:14:38.958 --> 00:14:40.958\nthrough art, through science,\n\n00:14:40.958 --> 00:14:43.958\nso much so that I think\nwe focus so much on\n\n00:14:43.958 --> 00:14:45.958\nthat side of our lives,\nthat we haven't given enough\n\n00:14:45.958 --> 00:14:48.958\nattention to the food and the water\nand the shelter,\n\n00:14:48.958 --> 00:14:51.958\nand what we need to raise the kids.\n\n00:14:51.958 --> 00:14:54.958\nSo, how can we envision\nthe city of the future?\n\n00:14:54.958 --> 00:14:56.958\nWell, what if we go\nto Madison Square Park,\n\n00:14:56.958 --> 00:14:59.958\nand we imagine it without all the cars,\n\n00:14:59.958 --> 00:15:01.958\nand bicycles instead\n\n00:15:01.958 --> 00:15:06.958\nand large forests, and streams instead\nof sewers and storm drains?\n\n00:15:06.958 --> 00:15:08.958\nWhat if we imagined the Upper East Side\n\n00:15:08.958 --> 00:15:12.958\nwith green roofs, and streams\nwinding through the city,\n\n00:15:12.958 --> 00:15:15.958\nand windmills supplying\nthe power we need?\n\n00:15:15.958 --> 00:15:18.958\nOr if we imagine the New York\nCity metropolitan area,\n\n00:15:18.958 --> 00:15:20.958\ncurrently home to 12 million people,\n\n00:15:20.958 --> 00:15:24.958\nbut 12 million people in the future,\nperhaps living at the density of Manhattan,\n\n00:15:24.958 --> 00:15:26.958\nin only 36 percent of the area,\n\n00:15:26.958 --> 00:15:29.958\nwith the areas in between\ncovered by farmland,\n\n00:15:29.958 --> 00:15:31.958\ncovered by wetlands,\n\n00:15:31.958 --> 00:15:33.958\ncovered by the marshes we need.\n\n00:15:33.958 --> 00:15:36.958\nThis is the kind of future I think we need,\n\n00:15:36.958 --> 00:15:39.958\nis a future that has the same diversity\n\n00:15:39.958 --> 00:15:42.958\nand abundance and dynamism of Manhattan,\n\n00:15:42.958 --> 00:15:45.958\nbut that learns from the\nsustainability of the past,\n\n00:15:45.958 --> 00:15:50.958\nof the ecology, the original ecology,\nof nature with all its parts.\n\n00:15:50.958 --> 00:15:52.958\nThank you very much.\n\n00:15:52.958 --> 00:15:59.958\n(Applause)"}, {"title": "Robots that \"show emotion\"", "duration": "297", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/david_hanson_robots_that_relate_to_you",

And by that, I mean that I develop robots that are characters, but also robots that will eventually come to empathize with you. So we're starting with a variety of technologies that have converged into these conversational character robots that can see faces, make eye contact with you, make a full range of facial expressions, understand speech and begin to model how you're feeling and who you are, and build a relationship with you.I developed a series of technologies that allowed the robots to make more realistic facial expressions than previously achieved, on lower power, which enabled the walking biped robots, the first androids. So, it's a full range of facial expressions simulating all the major muscles in the human face, running on very small batteries, extremely lightweight.The materials that allowed the battery-operated facial expressions is a material that we call Frubber, and it actually has three major innovations in the material that allow this to happen. One is hierarchical pores, and the other is a macro-molecular nanoscale porosity in the material.There he's starting to walk. This is at the Korean Advanced Institute of Science and Technology. I built the head. They built the body. So the goal here is to achieve sentience in machines, and not just sentience, but empathy.We're working with the Machine Perception Laboratory at the U.C. San Diego. They have this really remarkable facial expression technology that recognizes facial expressions, what facial expressions you're making. It also recognizes where you're looking, your head orientation. We're emulating all the major facial expressions, and then controlling it with the software that we call the Character Engine. And here is a little bit of the technology that's involved in that.In fact, right now \u2014 plug it from here, and then plug it in here, and now let's see if it gets my facial expressions. Okay. So I'm smiling. (Laughter) Now I'm frowning. And this is really heavily backlit. Okay, here we go. Oh, it's so sad. Okay, so you smile, frowning. So his perception of your emotional states is very important for machines to effectively become empathetic.Machines are becoming devastatingly capable of things like killing. Right? Those machines have no place for empathy. And there is billions of dollars being spent on that. Character robotics could plant the seed for robots that actually have empathy. So, if they achieve human level intelligence or, quite possibly, greater than human levels of intelligence, this could be the seeds of hope for our future.So, we've made 20 robots in the last eight years, during the course of getting my Ph.D. And then I started Hanson Robotics, which has been developing these things for mass manufacturing. This is one of our robots that we showed at Wired NextFest a couple of years ago. And it sees multiple people in a scene, remembers where individual people are, and looks from person to person, remembering people.So, we're involving two things. One, the perception of people, and two, the natural interface, the natural form of the interface, so that it's more intuitive for you to interact with the robot. You start to believe that it's alive and aware.So one of my favorite projects was bringing all this stuff together in an artistic display of an android portrait of science-fiction writer Philip K. Dick, who wrote great works like, \"Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?\" which was the basis of the movie \"Bladerunner.\" In these stories, robots often think that they're human, and they sort of come to life. So we put his writings, letters, his interviews, correspondences, into a huge database of thousands of pages, and then used some natural language processing to allow you to actually have a conversation with him. And it was kind of spooky, because he would say these things that just sounded like they really understood you.And this is one of the most exciting projects that we're developing, which is a little character that's a spokesbot for friendly artificial intelligence, friendly machine intelligence. And we're getting this mass-manufactured. We specked it out to actually be doable with a very, very low-cost bill of materials, so that it can become a childhood companion for kids. Interfacing with the Internet, it gets smarter over the years. As artificial intelligence evolves, so does his intelligence.Chris Anderson: Thank you so much. That's incredible.

Normally, as an advertising man, I actually speak at TED Evil, which is TED's secret sister that pays all the bills. It's held every two years in Burma. And I particularly remember a really good speech by Kim Jong Il on how to get teens smoking again. (Laughter)But, actually, it's suddenly come to me after years working in the business, that what we create in advertising, which is intangible value \u2014 you might call it perceived value, you might call it badge value, subjective value, intangible value of some kind \u2014 gets rather a bad rap. If you think about it, if you want to live in a world in the future where there are fewer material goods, you basically have two choices. You can either live in a world which is poorer, which people in general don't like. Or you can live in a world where actually intangible value constitutes a greater part of overall value, that actually intangible value, in many ways is a very, very fine substitute for using up labor or limited resources in the creation of things.Here is one example. This is a train which goes from London to Paris. The question was given to a bunch of engineers, about 15 years ago, \"How do we make the journey to Paris better?\" And they came up with a very good engineering solution, which was to spend six billion pounds building completely new tracks from London to the coast, and knocking about 40 minutes off a three-and-half-hour journey time. Now, call me Mister Picky. I'm just an ad man ... ... but it strikes me as a slightly unimaginative way of improving a train journey merely to make it shorter. Now what is the hedonic opportunity cost on spending six billion pounds on those railway tracks?Here is my naive advertising man's suggestion. What you should in fact do is employ all of the world's top male and female supermodels, pay them to walk the length of the train, handing out free Chateau Petrus for the entire duration of the journey. (Laughter) (Applause) Now, you'll still have about three billion pounds left in change, and people will ask for the trains to be slowed down. (Laughter)Now, here is another naive advertising man's question again. And this shows that engineers, medical people, scientific people, have an obsession with solving the problems of reality, when actually most problems, once you reach a basic level of wealth in society, most problems are actually problems of perception. So I'll ask you another question. What on earth is wrong with placebos? They seem fantastic to me. They cost very little to develop. They work extraordinarily well. They have no side effects, or if they do, they're imaginary, so you can safely ignore them. (Laughter)So I was discussing this. And I actually went to the Marginal Revolution blog by Tyler Cowen. I don't know if anybody knows it. Someone was actually suggesting that you can take this concept further, and actually produce placebo education. The point is that education doesn't actually work by teaching you things. It actually works by giving you the impression that you've had a very good education, which gives you an insane sense of unwarranted self-confidence, which then makes you very, very successful in later life. So, welcome to Oxford, ladies and gentlemen. (Laughter) (Applause)But, actually, the point of placebo education is interesting. How many problems of life can be solved actually by tinkering with perception, rather than that tedious, hardworking and messy business of actually trying to change reality? Here's a great example from history. I've heard this attributed to several other kings, but doing a bit of historical research, it seems to be Fredrick the Great. Fredrick the Great of Prussia was very, very keen for the Germans to adopt the potato and to eat it, because he realized that if you had two sources of carbohydrate, wheat and potatoes, you get less price volatility in bread. And you get a far lower risk of famine, because you actually had two crops to fall back on, not one.The only problem is: potatoes, if you think about it, look pretty disgusting. And also, 18th century Prussians ate very, very few vegetables \u2014 rather like contemporary Scottish people. (Laughter) So, actually, he tried making it compulsory. The Prussian peasantry said, \"We can't even get the dogs to eat these damn things. They are absolutely disgusting and they're good for nothing.\" There are even records of people being executed for refusing to grow potatoes.So he tried plan B. He tried the marketing solution, which is he declared the potato as a royal vegetable, and none but the royal family could consume it. And he planted it in a royal potato patch, with guards who had instructions to guard over it, night and day, but with secret instructions not to guard it very well. (Laughter) Now, 18th century peasants know that there is one pretty safe rule in life, which is if something is worth guarding, it's worth stealing. Before long, there was a massive underground potato-growing operation in Germany. What he'd effectively done is he'd re-branded the potato. It was an absolute masterpiece.I told this story and a gentleman from Turkey came up to me and said, \"Very, very good marketer, Fredrick the Great. But not a patch on Ataturk.\" Ataturk, rather like Nicolas Sarkozy, was very keen to discourage the wearing of a veil, in Turkey, to modernize it. Now, boring people would have just simply banned the veil. But that would have ended up with a lot of awful kickback and a hell of a lot of resistance. Ataturk was a lateral thinker. He made it compulsory for prostitutes to wear the veil. (Laughter) (Applause)I can't verify that fully, but it does not matter. There is your environmental problem solved, by the way, guys: All convicted child molesters have to drive a Porsche Cayenne. (Laughter) What Ataturk realized actually is two very fundamental things. Which is that, actually, first one, all value is actually relative. All value is perceived value.For those of you who don't speak Spanish, jugo de naranja \u2014 it's actually the Spanish for \"orange juice.\" Because actually it's not the dollar. It's actually the peso in Buenos Aires. Very clever Buenos Aires street vendors decided to practice price discrimination to the detriment of any passing gringo tourists. As an advertising man, I have to admire that.But the first thing is that all value is subjective. Second point is that persuasion is often better than compulsion. These funny signs that flash your speed at you, some of the new ones, on the bottom right, now actually show a smiley face or a frowny face, to act as an emotional trigger. What's fascinating about these signs is they cost about 10 percent of the running cost of a conventional speed camera, but they prevent twice as many accidents. So, the bizarre thing, which is baffling to conventional, classically trained economists, is that a weird little smiley face has a better effect on changing your behavior than the threat of a \u00a360 fine and three penalty points.Tiny little behavioral economics detail: in Italy, penalty points go backwards. You start with 12 and they take them away. Because they found that loss aversion is a more powerful influence on people's behavior. In Britain we tend to feel, \"Whoa! Got another three!\" Not so in Italy.Another fantastic case of creating intangible value to replace actual or material value, which remember, is what, after all, the environmental movement needs to be about: This again is from Prussia, from, I think, about 1812, 1813. The wealthy Prussians, to help in the war against the French, were encouraged to give in all their jewelry. And it was replaced with replica jewelry made of cast iron. Here's one: \"Gold gab ich f\u00fcr Eisen, 1813.\" The interesting thing is that for 50 years hence, the highest status jewelry you could wear in Prussia wasn't made of gold or diamonds. It was made of cast iron. Because actually, never mind the actual intrinsic value of having gold jewelry. This actually had symbolic value, badge value. It said that your family had made a great sacrifice in the past.So, the modern equivalent would of course be this. (Laughter) But, actually, there is a thing, just as there are Veblen goods, where the value of the good depends on it being expensive and rare \u2014 there are opposite kind of things where actually the value in them depends on them being ubiquitous, classless and minimalistic.If you think about it, Shakerism was a proto-environmental movement. Adam Smith talks about 18th century America, where the prohibition against visible displays of wealth was so great, it was almost a block in the economy in New England, because even wealthy farmers could find nothing to spend their money on without incurring the displeasure of their neighbors. It's perfectly possible to create these social pressures which lead to more egalitarian societies.What's also interesting, if you look at products that have a high component of what you might call messaging value, a high component of intangible value, versus their intrinsic value: They are often quite egalitarian. In terms of dress, denim is perhaps the perfect example of something which replaces material value with symbolic value. Coca-Cola. A bunch of you may be a load of pinkos, and you may not like the Coca-Cola company, but it's worth remembering Andy Warhol's point about Coke. What Warhol said about Coke is, he said, \"What I really like about Coca-Cola is the president of the United States can't get a better Coke than the bum on the corner of the street.\" Now, that is, actually, when you think about it \u2014 we take it for granted \u2014 it's actually a remarkable achievement, to produce something that's that democratic.Now, we basically have to change our views slightly. There is a basic view that real value involves making things, involves labor. It involves engineering. It involves limited raw materials. And that what we add on top is kind of false. It's a fake version. And there is a reason for some suspicion and uncertainly about it. It patently veers toward propaganda. However, what we do have now is a much more variegated media ecosystem in which to kind of create this kind of value, and it's much fairer.When I grew up, this was basically the media environment of my childhood as translated into food. You had a monopoly supplier. On the left, you have Rupert Murdoch, or the BBC. (Laughter) And on your right you have a dependent public which is pathetically grateful for anything you give it. (Laughter)Nowadays, the user is actually involved. This is actually what's called, in the digital world, \"user-generated content.\" Although it's called agriculture in the world of food. (Laughter) This is actually called a mash-up, where you take content that someone else has produced and you do something new with it. In the world of food we call it cooking. This is food 2.0, which is food you produce for the purpose of sharing it with other people. This is mobile food. British are very good at that. Fish and chips in newspaper, the Cornish Pasty, the pie, the sandwich. We invented the whole lot of them. We're not very good at food in general. Italians do great food, but it's not very portable, generally. (Laughter)I only learned this the other day. The Earl of Sandwich didn't invent the sandwich. He actually invented the toasty. But then, the Earl of Toasty would be a ridiculous name. (Laughter)Finally, we have contextual communication. Now, the reason I show you Pernod \u2014 it's only one example. Every country has a contextual alcoholic drink. In France it's Pernod. It tastes great within the borders of that country, but absolute shite if you take it anywhere else. (Laughter) Unicum in Hungary, for example. The Greeks have actually managed to produce something called Retsina, which even tastes shite when you're in Greece. (Laughter)But so much communication now is contextual that the capacity for actually nudging people, for giving them better information \u2014 B.J. Fogg, at the University of Stanford, makes the point that actually the mobile phone is \u2014 He's invented the phrase, \"persuasive technologies.\" He believes the mobile phone, by being location-specific, contextual, timely and immediate, is simply the greatest persuasive technology device ever invented.Now, if we have all these tools at our disposal, we simply have to ask the question, and Thaler and Sunstein have, of how we can use these more intelligently. I'll give you one example. If you had a large red button of this kind, on the wall of your home, and every time you pressed it, it saved 50 dollars for you, put 50 dollars into your pension, you would save a lot more. The reason is that the interface fundamentally determines the behavior. Okay?Now, marketing has done a very, very good job of creating opportunities for impulse buying. Yet we've never created the opportunity for impulse saving. If you did this, more people would save more. It's simply a question of changing the interface by which people make decisions, and the very nature of the decisions changes. Obviously, I don't want people to do this, because as an advertising man I tend to regard saving as just consumerism needlessly postponed. (Laughter) But if anybody did want to do that, that's the kind of thing we need to be thinking about, actually: fundamental opportunities to change human behavior.Now, I've got an example here from Canada. There was a young intern at Ogilvy Canada called Hunter Somerville, who was working in improv in Toronto, and got a part-time job in advertising, and was given the job of advertising Shreddies. Now this is the most perfect case of creating intangible, added value, without changing the product in the slightest. Shreddies is a strange, square, whole-grain cereal, only available in New Zealand, Canada and Britain. It's Kraft's peculiar way of rewarding loyalty to the crown. (Laughter) In working out how you could re-launch Shreddies, he came up with this.Video: (Buzzer) Man: Shreddies is supposed to be square. (Laughter)Woman: Have any of these diamond shapes gone out? (Laughter)Voiceover: New Diamond Shreddies cereal. Same 100 percent whole-grain wheat in a delicious diamond shape. (Applause)Rory Sutherland: I'm not sure this isn't the most perfect example of intangible value creation. All it requires is photons, neurons, and a great idea to create this thing. I would say it's a work of genius. But, naturally, you can't do this kind of thing without a little bit of market research.Man: So, Shreddies is actually producing a new product, which is something very exciting for them. So they are introducing new Diamond Shreddies. (Laughter) So I just want to get your first impressions when you see that, when you see the Diamond Shreddies box there. (Laughter)Woman: Weren't they square?Woman #2: I'm a little bit confused. Woman #3: They look like the squares to me.Man: They \u2014 Yeah, it's all in the appearance. But it's kind of like flipping a six or a nine. Like a six, if you flip it over it looks like a nine. But a six is very different from a nine.Woman # 3: Or an \"M\" and a \"W\". Man: An \"M\" and a \"W\", exactly.Man #2: [unclear] You just looked like you turned it on its end. But when you see it like that it's more interesting looking.Man: Just try both of them. Take a square one there, first. (Laughter) Man: Which one did you prefer? Man #2: The first one.Man: The first one? (Laughter)Rory Sutherland: Now, naturally, a debate raged. There were conservative elements in Canada, unsurprisingly, who actually resented this intrusion. So, eventually, the manufacturers actually arrived at a compromise, which was the combo pack. (Laughter) (Applause) (Laughter)If you think it's funny, bear in mind there is an organization called the American Institute of Wine Economics, which actually does extensive research into perception of things, and discovers that except for among perhaps five or ten percent of the most knowledgeable people, there is no correlation between quality and enjoyment in wine, except when you tell the people how expensive it is, in which case they tend to enjoy the more expensive stuff more. So drink your wine blind in the future.But this is both hysterically funny \u2014 but I think an important philosophical point, which is, going forward, we need more of this kind of value. We need to spend more time appreciating what already exists, and less time agonizing over what else we can do.Two quotations to more or less end with. One of them is, \"Poetry is when you make new things familiar and familiar things new.\" Which isn't a bad definition of what our job is, to help people appreciate what is unfamiliar, but also to gain a greater appreciation, and place a far higher value on those things which are already existing. There is some evidence, by the way, that things like social networking help do that. Because they help people share news. They give badge value to everyday little trivial activities. So they actually reduce the need for actually spending great money on display, and increase the kind of third-party enjoyment you can get from the smallest, simplest things in life. Which is magic.The second one is the second G.K. Chesterton quote of this session, which is, \"We are perishing for want of wonder, not for want of wonders,\" which I think for anybody involved in technology, is perfectly true. And a final thing: When you place a value on things like health, love, sex and other things, and learn to place a material value on what you've previously discounted for being merely intangible, a thing not seen, you realize you're much, much wealthier than you ever imagined. Thank you very much indeed. (Applause)", "id": 658, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:11.958 --> 00:00:14.958\nThis is my first time at TED. Normally, as an advertising man,\n\n00:00:14.958 --> 00:00:17.958\nI actually speak at TED Evil, which is TED's secret sister\n\n00:00:17.958 --> 00:00:20.958\nthat pays all the bills.\n\n00:00:20.958 --> 00:00:23.958\nIt's held every two years in Burma.\n\n00:00:23.958 --> 00:00:26.958\nAnd I particularly remember a really good speech\n\n00:00:26.958 --> 00:00:29.958\nby Kim Jong Il on how to get teens smoking again.\n\n00:00:29.958 --> 00:00:31.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:00:31.958 --> 00:00:33.958\nBut, actually, it's suddenly come to me after years working in the business,\n\n00:00:33.958 --> 00:00:36.958\nthat what we create in advertising,\n\n00:00:36.958 --> 00:00:38.958\nwhich is intangible value -- you might call it perceived value,\n\n00:00:38.958 --> 00:00:41.958\nyou might call it badge value, subjective value,\n\n00:00:41.958 --> 00:00:43.958\nintangible value of some kind --\n\n00:00:43.958 --> 00:00:45.958\ngets rather a bad rap.\n\n00:00:45.958 --> 00:00:47.958\nIf you think about it, if you want to live in a world in the future\n\n00:00:47.958 --> 00:00:51.958\nwhere there are fewer material goods, you basically have two choices.\n\n00:00:51.958 --> 00:00:53.958\nYou can either live in a world which is poorer,\n\n00:00:53.958 --> 00:00:55.958\nwhich people in general don't like.\n\n00:00:55.958 --> 00:00:58.958\nOr you can live in a world where actually intangible value\n\n00:00:58.958 --> 00:01:02.958\nconstitutes a greater part of overall value,\n\n00:01:02.958 --> 00:01:04.958\nthat actually intangible value, in many ways\n\n00:01:04.958 --> 00:01:06.958\nis a very, very fine substitute\n\n00:01:06.958 --> 00:01:09.958\nfor using up labor or limited resources\n\n00:01:09.958 --> 00:01:11.958\nin the creation of things.\n\n00:01:11.958 --> 00:01:14.958\nHere is one example. This is a train which goes from London to Paris.\n\n00:01:14.958 --> 00:01:16.958\nThe question was given to a bunch of engineers,\n\n00:01:16.958 --> 00:01:20.958\nabout 15 years ago, \"How do we make the journey to Paris better?\"\n\n00:01:20.958 --> 00:01:22.958\nAnd they came up with a very good engineering solution,\n\n00:01:22.958 --> 00:01:24.958\nwhich was to spend six billion pounds\n\n00:01:24.958 --> 00:01:26.958\nbuilding completely new tracks\n\n00:01:26.958 --> 00:01:28.958\nfrom London to the coast,\n\n00:01:28.958 --> 00:01:32.958\nand knocking about 40 minutes off a three-and-half-hour journey time.\n\n00:01:32.958 --> 00:01:34.958\nNow, call me Mister Picky. I'm just an ad man ...\n\n00:01:34.958 --> 00:01:38.958\n... but it strikes me as a slightly unimaginative way of improving a train journey\n\n00:01:38.958 --> 00:01:40.958\nmerely to make it shorter.\n\n00:01:40.958 --> 00:01:43.958\nNow what is the hedonic opportunity cost\n\n00:01:43.958 --> 00:01:45.958\non spending six billion pounds on those railway tracks?\n\n00:01:45.958 --> 00:01:48.958\nHere is my naive advertising man's suggestion.\n\n00:01:48.958 --> 00:01:50.958\nWhat you should in fact do is employ all of the world's top male\n\n00:01:50.958 --> 00:01:52.958\nand female supermodels,\n\n00:01:52.958 --> 00:01:56.958\npay them to walk the length of the train, handing out free Chateau Petrus\n\n00:01:56.958 --> 00:01:58.958\nfor the entire duration of the journey.\n\n00:01:58.958 --> 00:02:00.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:02:00.958 --> 00:02:01.958\n(Applause)\n\n00:02:01.958 --> 00:02:05.958\nNow, you'll still have about three billion pounds left in change,\n\n00:02:05.958 --> 00:02:08.958\nand people will ask for the trains to be slowed down.\n\n00:02:08.958 --> 00:02:09.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:02:09.958 --> 00:02:13.958\nNow, here is another naive advertising man's question again.\n\n00:02:13.958 --> 00:02:15.958\nAnd this shows that engineers,\n\n00:02:15.958 --> 00:02:17.958\nmedical people, scientific people,\n\n00:02:17.958 --> 00:02:20.958\nhave an obsession with solving the problems of reality,\n\n00:02:20.958 --> 00:02:23.958\nwhen actually most problems, once you reach a basic level of wealth\n\n00:02:23.958 --> 00:02:26.958\nin society, most problems are actually problems of perception.\n\n00:02:26.958 --> 00:02:28.958\nSo I'll ask you another question.\n\n00:02:28.958 --> 00:02:30.958\nWhat on earth is wrong with placebos?\n\n00:02:30.958 --> 00:02:32.958\nThey seem fantastic to me. They cost very little to develop.\n\n00:02:32.958 --> 00:02:35.958\nThey work extraordinarily well.\n\n00:02:35.958 --> 00:02:37.958\nThey have no side effects,\n\n00:02:37.958 --> 00:02:39.958\nor if they do, they're imaginary, so you can safely ignore them.\n\n00:02:39.958 --> 00:02:41.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:02:41.958 --> 00:02:43.958\nSo I was discussing this. And I actually went to the Marginal Revolution blog\n\n00:02:43.958 --> 00:02:45.958\nby Tyler Cowen. I don't know if anybody knows it.\n\n00:02:45.958 --> 00:02:48.958\nSomeone was actually suggesting that you can take this concept further,\n\n00:02:48.958 --> 00:02:50.958\nand actually produce placebo education.\n\n00:02:50.958 --> 00:02:54.958\nThe point is that education doesn't actually work by teaching you things.\n\n00:02:54.958 --> 00:02:56.958\nIt actually works by giving you the impression\n\n00:02:56.958 --> 00:02:58.958\nthat you've had a very good education, which gives you an insane sense\n\n00:02:58.958 --> 00:03:00.958\nof unwarranted self-confidence,\n\n00:03:00.958 --> 00:03:03.958\nwhich then makes you very, very successful in later life.\n\n00:03:03.958 --> 00:03:06.958\nSo, welcome to Oxford, ladies and gentlemen.\n\n00:03:06.958 --> 00:03:08.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:03:08.958 --> 00:03:09.958\n(Applause)\n\n00:03:09.958 --> 00:03:12.958\nBut, actually, the point of placebo education is interesting.\n\n00:03:12.958 --> 00:03:14.958\nHow many problems of life can be solved\n\n00:03:14.958 --> 00:03:16.958\nactually by tinkering with perception,\n\n00:03:16.958 --> 00:03:18.958\nrather than that tedious, hardworking and messy business\n\n00:03:18.958 --> 00:03:21.958\nof actually trying to change reality?\n\n00:03:21.958 --> 00:03:24.958\nHere's a great example from history. I've heard this attributed to several other kings,\n\n00:03:24.958 --> 00:03:26.958\nbut doing a bit of historical research,\n\n00:03:26.958 --> 00:03:28.958\nit seems to be Fredrick the Great.\n\n00:03:28.958 --> 00:03:30.958\nFredrick the Great of Prussia was very, very keen\n\n00:03:30.958 --> 00:03:33.958\nfor the Germans to adopt the potato and to eat it,\n\n00:03:33.958 --> 00:03:35.958\nbecause he realized that if you had two sources of carbohydrate,\n\n00:03:35.958 --> 00:03:39.958\nwheat and potatoes, you get less price volatility in bread.\n\n00:03:39.958 --> 00:03:41.958\nAnd you get a far lower risk of famine,\n\n00:03:41.958 --> 00:03:43.958\nbecause you actually had two crops to fall back on, not one.\n\n00:03:43.958 --> 00:03:46.958\nThe only problem is: potatoes, if you think about it, look pretty disgusting.\n\n00:03:46.958 --> 00:03:50.958\nAnd also, 18th century Prussians ate very, very few vegetables --\n\n00:03:50.958 --> 00:03:52.958\nrather like contemporary Scottish people.\n\n00:03:52.958 --> 00:03:54.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:03:54.958 --> 00:03:57.958\nSo, actually, he tried making it compulsory.\n\n00:03:57.958 --> 00:03:59.958\nThe Prussian peasantry said,\n\n00:03:59.958 --> 00:04:01.958\n\"We can't even get the dogs to eat these damn things.\n\n00:04:01.958 --> 00:04:03.958\nThey are absolutely disgusting and they're good for nothing.\"\n\n00:04:03.958 --> 00:04:05.958\nThere are even records of people being executed\n\n00:04:05.958 --> 00:04:07.958\nfor refusing to grow potatoes.\n\n00:04:07.958 --> 00:04:09.958\nSo he tried plan B.\n\n00:04:09.958 --> 00:04:11.958\nHe tried the marketing solution, which is he declared the potato\n\n00:04:11.958 --> 00:04:14.958\nas a royal vegetable, and none but the royal family could consume it.\n\n00:04:14.958 --> 00:04:16.958\nAnd he planted it in a royal potato patch,\n\n00:04:16.958 --> 00:04:18.958\nwith guards who had instructions\n\n00:04:18.958 --> 00:04:20.958\nto guard over it, night and day,\n\n00:04:20.958 --> 00:04:23.958\nbut with secret instructions not to guard it very well.\n\n00:04:23.958 --> 00:04:24.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:04:24.958 --> 00:04:26.958\nNow, 18th century peasants know that there is one\n\n00:04:26.958 --> 00:04:28.958\npretty safe rule in life, which is if something is worth guarding,\n\n00:04:28.958 --> 00:04:30.958\nit's worth stealing.\n\n00:04:30.958 --> 00:04:32.958\nBefore long, there was a massive underground\n\n00:04:32.958 --> 00:04:34.958\npotato-growing operation in Germany.\n\n00:04:34.958 --> 00:04:38.958\nWhat he'd effectively done is he'd re-branded the potato.\n\n00:04:38.958 --> 00:04:40.958\nIt was an absolute masterpiece.\n\n00:04:40.958 --> 00:04:42.958\nI told this story and a gentleman from Turkey came up to me and said,\n\n00:04:42.958 --> 00:04:46.958\n\"Very, very good marketer, Fredrick the Great. But not a patch on Ataturk.\"\n\n00:04:46.958 --> 00:04:48.958\nAtaturk, rather like Nicolas Sarkozy,\n\n00:04:48.958 --> 00:04:50.958\nwas very keen to discourage the wearing of a veil,\n\n00:04:50.958 --> 00:04:52.958\nin Turkey, to modernize it.\n\n00:04:52.958 --> 00:04:55.958\nNow, boring people would have just simply banned the veil.\n\n00:04:55.958 --> 00:04:57.958\nBut that would have ended up with a lot of awful kickback\n\n00:04:57.958 --> 00:04:59.958\nand a hell of a lot of resistance.\n\n00:04:59.958 --> 00:05:01.958\nAtaturk was a lateral thinker.\n\n00:05:01.958 --> 00:05:04.958\nHe made it compulsory for prostitutes to wear the veil.\n\n00:05:04.958 --> 00:05:09.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:05:09.958 --> 00:05:11.958\n(Applause)\n\n00:05:11.958 --> 00:05:13.958\nI can't verify that fully, but it does not matter.\n\n00:05:13.958 --> 00:05:15.958\nThere is your environmental problem solved, by the way, guys:\n\n00:05:15.958 --> 00:05:17.958\nAll convicted child molesters\n\n00:05:17.958 --> 00:05:19.958\nhave to drive a Porsche Cayenne.\n\n00:05:19.958 --> 00:05:24.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:05:24.958 --> 00:05:27.958\nWhat Ataturk realized actually is two very fundamental things.\n\n00:05:27.958 --> 00:05:29.958\nWhich is that, actually, first one,\n\n00:05:29.958 --> 00:05:32.958\nall value is actually relative.\n\n00:05:32.958 --> 00:05:34.958\nAll value is perceived value.\n\n00:05:34.958 --> 00:05:36.958\nFor those of you who don't speak Spanish, jugo de naranja -- it's actually the Spanish for \"orange juice.\"\n\n00:05:36.958 --> 00:05:38.958\nBecause actually it's not the dollar. It's actually the peso\n\n00:05:38.958 --> 00:05:41.958\nin Buenos Aires. Very clever Buenos Aires street vendors\n\n00:05:41.958 --> 00:05:43.958\ndecided to practice price discrimination\n\n00:05:43.958 --> 00:05:46.958\nto the detriment of any passing gringo tourists.\n\n00:05:46.958 --> 00:05:48.958\nAs an advertising man, I have to admire that.\n\n00:05:48.958 --> 00:05:52.958\nBut the first thing is that all value is subjective.\n\n00:05:52.958 --> 00:05:55.958\nSecond point is that persuasion is often better than compulsion.\n\n00:05:55.958 --> 00:05:57.958\nThese funny signs that flash your speed at you,\n\n00:05:57.958 --> 00:05:59.958\nsome of the new ones, on the bottom right,\n\n00:05:59.958 --> 00:06:02.958\nnow actually show a smiley face or a frowny face,\n\n00:06:02.958 --> 00:06:04.958\nto act as an emotional trigger.\n\n00:06:04.958 --> 00:06:06.958\nWhat's fascinating about these signs is they cost about 10 percent\n\n00:06:06.958 --> 00:06:09.958\nof the running cost of a conventional speed camera,\n\n00:06:09.958 --> 00:06:11.958\nbut they prevent twice as many accidents.\n\n00:06:11.958 --> 00:06:13.958\nSo, the bizarre thing, which is baffling\n\n00:06:13.958 --> 00:06:15.958\nto conventional, classically trained economists,\n\n00:06:15.958 --> 00:06:17.958\nis that a weird little smiley face\n\n00:06:17.958 --> 00:06:19.958\nhas a better effect on changing your behavior\n\n00:06:19.958 --> 00:06:24.958\nthan the threat of a \u00a360 fine and three penalty points.\n\n00:06:24.958 --> 00:06:26.958\nTiny little behavioral economics detail:\n\n00:06:26.958 --> 00:06:29.958\nin Italy, penalty points go backwards.\n\n00:06:29.958 --> 00:06:31.958\nYou start with 12 and they take them away.\n\n00:06:31.958 --> 00:06:33.958\nBecause they found that loss aversion\n\n00:06:33.958 --> 00:06:35.958\nis a more powerful influence on people's behavior.\n\n00:06:35.958 --> 00:06:38.958\nIn Britain we tend to feel, \"Whoa!

This actually\n\n00:07:17.958 --> 00:07:19.958\nhad symbolic value, badge value.\n\n00:07:19.958 --> 00:07:22.958\nIt said that your family had made a great sacrifice in the past.\n\n00:07:22.958 --> 00:07:24.958\nSo, the modern equivalent would of course be this.\n\n00:07:24.958 --> 00:07:25.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:07:25.958 --> 00:07:28.958\nBut, actually, there is a thing, just as there are Veblen goods,\n\n00:07:28.958 --> 00:07:31.958\nwhere the value of the good depends on it being expensive and rare --\n\n00:07:31.958 --> 00:07:33.958\nthere are opposite kind of things\n\n00:07:33.958 --> 00:07:35.958\nwhere actually the value in them depends on them being\n\n00:07:35.958 --> 00:07:38.958\nubiquitous, classless and minimalistic.\n\n00:07:38.958 --> 00:07:41.958\nIf you think about it, Shakerism was a proto-environmental movement.\n\n00:07:41.958 --> 00:07:43.958\nAdam Smith talks about 18th century America,\n\n00:07:43.958 --> 00:07:47.958\nwhere the prohibition against visible displays of wealth was so great,\n\n00:07:47.958 --> 00:07:49.958\nit was almost a block in the economy in New England,\n\n00:07:49.958 --> 00:07:52.958\nbecause even wealthy farmers could find nothing to spend their money on\n\n00:07:52.958 --> 00:07:55.958\nwithout incurring the displeasure of their neighbors.\n\n00:07:55.958 --> 00:07:57.958\nIt's perfectly possible to create these social pressures\n\n00:07:57.958 --> 00:08:00.958\nwhich lead to more egalitarian societies.\n\n00:08:00.958 --> 00:08:02.958\nWhat's also interesting, if you look at products\n\n00:08:02.958 --> 00:08:04.958\nthat have a high component\n\n00:08:04.958 --> 00:08:06.958\nof what you might call messaging value,\n\n00:08:06.958 --> 00:08:09.958\na high component of intangible value, versus their intrinsic value:\n\n00:08:09.958 --> 00:08:12.958\nThey are often quite egalitarian.\n\n00:08:12.958 --> 00:08:15.958\nIn terms of dress, denim is perhaps the perfect example of something\n\n00:08:15.958 --> 00:08:19.958\nwhich replaces material value with symbolic value.\n\n00:08:19.958 --> 00:08:21.958\nCoca-Cola.

It's a fake version.\n\n00:08:55.958 --> 00:08:58.958\nAnd there is a reason for some suspicion and uncertainly about it.\n\n00:08:58.958 --> 00:09:01.958\nIt patently veers toward propaganda.\n\n00:09:01.958 --> 00:09:03.958\nHowever, what we do have now\n\n00:09:03.958 --> 00:09:06.958\nis a much more variegated media ecosystem\n\n00:09:06.958 --> 00:09:09.958\nin which to kind of create this kind of value, and it's much fairer.\n\n00:09:09.958 --> 00:09:11.958\nWhen I grew up, this was basically the media environment of my childhood\n\n00:09:11.958 --> 00:09:13.958\nas translated into food.\n\n00:09:13.958 --> 00:09:15.958\nYou had a monopoly supplier.

Fogg,\n\n00:10:41.958 --> 00:10:43.958\nat the University of Stanford, makes the point\n\n00:10:43.958 --> 00:10:45.958\nthat actually the mobile phone is --\n\n00:10:45.958 --> 00:10:47.958\nHe's invented the phrase, \"persuasive technologies.\"\n\n00:10:47.958 --> 00:10:50.958\nHe believes the mobile phone, by being location-specific,\n\n00:10:50.958 --> 00:10:52.958\ncontextual, timely and immediate,\n\n00:10:52.958 --> 00:10:55.958\nis simply the greatest persuasive technology device ever invented.\n\n00:10:55.958 --> 00:10:57.958\nNow, if we have all these tools at our disposal,\n\n00:10:57.958 --> 00:10:59.958\nwe simply have to ask the question,\n\n00:10:59.958 --> 00:11:02.958\nand Thaler and Sunstein have, of how we can use these more intelligently.\n\n00:11:02.958 --> 00:11:05.958\nI'll give you one example.\n\n00:11:05.958 --> 00:11:07.958\nIf you had a large red button of this kind, on the wall of your home,\n\n00:11:07.958 --> 00:11:10.958\nand every time you pressed it, it saved 50 dollars for you,\n\n00:11:10.958 --> 00:11:12.958\nput 50 dollars into your pension,\n\n00:11:12.958 --> 00:11:14.958\nyou would save a lot more.\n\n00:11:14.958 --> 00:11:16.958\nThe reason is that the interface fundamentally determines\n\n00:11:16.958 --> 00:11:18.958\nthe behavior. Okay?\n\n00:11:18.958 --> 00:11:21.958\nNow, marketing has done a very, very good job of creating\n\n00:11:21.958 --> 00:11:23.958\nopportunities for impulse buying.\n\n00:11:23.958 --> 00:11:27.958\nYet we've never created the opportunity for impulse saving.\n\n00:11:27.958 --> 00:11:30.958\nIf you did this, more people would save more.\n\n00:11:30.958 --> 00:11:32.958\nIt's simply a question of changing the interface\n\n00:11:32.958 --> 00:11:34.958\nby which people make decisions,\n\n00:11:34.958 --> 00:11:36.958\nand the very nature of the decisions changes.\n\n00:11:36.958 --> 00:11:38.958\nObviously, I don't want people to do this,\n\n00:11:38.958 --> 00:11:40.958\nbecause as an advertising man I tend to regard saving as just\n\n00:11:40.958 --> 00:11:42.958\nconsumerism needlessly postponed.\n\n00:11:42.958 --> 00:11:43.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:11:43.958 --> 00:11:46.958\nBut if anybody did want to do that,\n\n00:11:46.958 --> 00:11:49.958\nthat's the kind of thing we need to be thinking about, actually:\n\n00:11:49.958 --> 00:11:51.958\nfundamental opportunities to change human behavior.\n\n00:11:51.958 --> 00:11:54.958\nNow, I've got an example here from Canada.\n\n00:11:54.958 --> 00:11:57.958\nThere was a young intern at Ogilvy Canada\n\n00:11:57.958 --> 00:11:59.958\ncalled Hunter Somerville,\n\n00:11:59.958 --> 00:12:01.958\nwho was working in improv in Toronto,\n\n00:12:01.958 --> 00:12:03.958\nand got a part-time job in advertising,\n\n00:12:03.958 --> 00:12:06.958\nand was given the job of advertising Shreddies.\n\n00:12:06.958 --> 00:12:08.958\nNow this is the most perfect case of creating\n\n00:12:08.958 --> 00:12:10.958\nintangible, added value,\n\n00:12:10.958 --> 00:12:13.958\nwithout changing the product in the slightest.\n\n00:12:13.958 --> 00:12:16.958\nShreddies is a strange, square, whole-grain cereal,\n\n00:12:16.958 --> 00:12:20.958\nonly available in New Zealand, Canada and Britain.\n\n00:12:20.958 --> 00:12:23.958\nIt's Kraft's peculiar way of rewarding loyalty to the crown.\n\n00:12:23.958 --> 00:12:26.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:12:26.958 --> 00:12:29.958\nIn working out how you could re-launch Shreddies,\n\n00:12:29.958 --> 00:12:31.958\nhe came up with this.\n\n00:12:38.958 --> 00:12:43.958\nVideo: (Buzzer)\n\n00:12:44.958 --> 00:12:47.958\nMan: Shreddies is supposed to be square.\n\n00:12:47.958 --> 00:12:48.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:12:48.958 --> 00:12:51.958\nWoman: Have any of these diamond shapes gone out?\n\n00:12:51.958 --> 00:12:53.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:12:53.958 --> 00:12:55.958\nVoiceover: New Diamond Shreddies cereal.\n\n00:12:55.958 --> 00:12:58.958\nSame 100 percent whole-grain wheat in a delicious diamond shape.\n\n00:12:58.958 --> 00:13:02.958\n(Applause)\n\n00:13:02.958 --> 00:13:04.958\nRory Sutherland: I'm not sure this isn't the most perfect example\n\n00:13:04.958 --> 00:13:06.958\nof intangible value creation. All it requires is\n\n00:13:06.958 --> 00:13:09.958\nphotons, neurons, and a great idea to create this thing.\n\n00:13:09.958 --> 00:13:11.958\nI would say it's a work of genius.\n\n00:13:11.958 --> 00:13:14.958\nBut, naturally, you can't do this kind of thing without a little bit of market research.\n\n00:13:14.958 --> 00:13:17.958\nMan: So, Shreddies is actually producing a new product,\n\n00:13:17.958 --> 00:13:20.958\nwhich is something very exciting for them.\n\n00:13:20.958 --> 00:13:23.958\nSo they are introducing new Diamond Shreddies.\n\n00:13:23.958 --> 00:13:28.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:13:28.958 --> 00:13:30.958\nSo I just want to get your first impressions when you see that,\n\n00:13:30.958 --> 00:13:33.958\nwhen you see the Diamond Shreddies box there.\n\n00:13:33.958 --> 00:13:34.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:13:34.958 --> 00:13:36.958\nWoman: Weren't they square?\n\n00:13:36.958 --> 00:13:38.958\nWoman #2: I'm a little bit confused. Woman #3: They look like the squares to me.\n\n00:13:38.958 --> 00:13:40.958\nMan: They -- Yeah, it's all in the appearance.\n\n00:13:40.958 --> 00:13:44.958\nBut it's kind of like flipping a six or a nine. Like a six,\n\n00:13:44.958 --> 00:13:46.958\nif you flip it over it looks like a nine.\n\n00:13:46.958 --> 00:13:48.958\nBut a six is very different from a nine.\n\n00:13:48.958 --> 00:13:50.958\nWoman # 3: Or an \"M\" and a \"W\". Man: An \"M\" and a \"W\", exactly.\n\n00:13:50.958 --> 00:13:52.958\nMan #2: [unclear]\n\n00:13:52.958 --> 00:13:55.958\nYou just looked like you turned it on its end. But when you see it like that\n\n00:13:55.958 --> 00:13:57.958\nit's more interesting looking.\n\n00:13:57.958 --> 00:13:59.958\nMan: Just try both of them.\n\n00:13:59.958 --> 00:14:02.958\nTake a square one there, first.\n\n00:14:02.958 --> 00:14:14.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:14:14.958 --> 00:14:16.958\nMan: Which one did you prefer? Man #2: The first one.\n\n00:14:16.958 --> 00:14:18.958\nMan: The first one?\n\n00:14:18.958 --> 00:14:20.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:14:20.958 --> 00:14:24.958\nRory Sutherland: Now, naturally, a debate raged.\n\n00:14:24.958 --> 00:14:27.958\nThere were conservative elements in Canada, unsurprisingly,\n\n00:14:27.958 --> 00:14:29.958\nwho actually resented this intrusion.\n\n00:14:29.958 --> 00:14:31.958\nSo, eventually, the manufacturers actually\n\n00:14:31.958 --> 00:14:34.958\narrived at a compromise, which was the combo pack.\n\n00:14:34.958 --> 00:14:36.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:14:36.958 --> 00:14:45.958\n(Applause)\n\n00:14:45.958 --> 00:14:50.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:14:50.958 --> 00:14:53.958\nIf you think it's funny, bear in mind there is an organization called\n\n00:14:53.958 --> 00:14:56.958\nthe American Institute of Wine Economics,\n\n00:14:56.958 --> 00:14:58.958\nwhich actually does extensive research into perception of things,\n\n00:14:58.958 --> 00:15:00.958\nand discovers that except for among\n\n00:15:00.958 --> 00:15:03.958\nperhaps five or ten percent of the most knowledgeable people,\n\n00:15:03.958 --> 00:15:05.958\nthere is no correlation between quality and enjoyment\n\n00:15:05.958 --> 00:15:07.958\nin wine,\n\n00:15:07.958 --> 00:15:09.958\nexcept when you tell the people how expensive it is,\n\n00:15:09.958 --> 00:15:12.958\nin which case they tend to enjoy the more expensive stuff more.\n\n00:15:12.958 --> 00:15:15.958\nSo drink your wine blind in the future.\n\n00:15:15.958 --> 00:15:17.958\nBut this is both hysterically funny --\n\n00:15:17.958 --> 00:15:19.958\nbut I think an important philosophical point,\n\n00:15:19.958 --> 00:15:22.958\nwhich is, going forward, we need more of this kind of value.\n\n00:15:22.958 --> 00:15:25.958\nWe need to spend more time appreciating what already exists,\n\n00:15:25.958 --> 00:15:27.958\nand less time agonizing over what else we can do.\n\n00:15:27.958 --> 00:15:29.958\nTwo quotations to more or less end with.\n\n00:15:29.958 --> 00:15:31.958\nOne of them is, \"Poetry is when you make new things\n\n00:15:31.958 --> 00:15:33.958\nfamiliar and familiar things new.\"\n\n00:15:33.958 --> 00:15:36.958\nWhich isn't a bad definition of what our job is,\n\n00:15:36.958 --> 00:15:38.958\nto help people appreciate what is unfamiliar, but also\n\n00:15:38.958 --> 00:15:42.958\nto gain a greater appreciation, and place a far higher value on\n\n00:15:42.958 --> 00:15:44.958\nthose things which are already existing.\n\n00:15:44.958 --> 00:15:47.958\nThere is some evidence, by the way, that things like social networking help do that.\n\n00:15:47.958 --> 00:15:49.958\nBecause they help people share news.\n\n00:15:49.958 --> 00:15:53.958\nThey give badge value to everyday little trivial activities.\n\n00:15:53.958 --> 00:15:56.958\nSo they actually reduce the need for actually spending great money on display,\n\n00:15:56.958 --> 00:15:58.958\nand increase the kind of third-party\n\n00:15:58.958 --> 00:16:02.958\nenjoyment you can get from the smallest, simplest things in life. Which is magic.\n\n00:16:02.958 --> 00:16:05.958\nThe second one is the second G.K. Chesterton quote of this session,\n\n00:16:05.958 --> 00:16:08.958\nwhich is, \"We are perishing for want of wonder, not for want of wonders,\"\n\n00:16:08.958 --> 00:16:11.958\nwhich I think for anybody involved in technology, is perfectly true.\n\n00:16:11.958 --> 00:16:13.958\nAnd a final thing: When you place a value on things like health,\n\n00:16:13.958 --> 00:16:15.958\nlove, sex and other things,\n\n00:16:15.958 --> 00:16:17.958\nand learn to place a material value\n\n00:16:17.958 --> 00:16:19.958\non what you've previously discounted\n\n00:16:19.958 --> 00:16:22.958\nfor being merely intangible, a thing not seen,\n\n00:16:22.958 --> 00:16:25.958\nyou realize you're much, much wealthier than you ever imagined.\n\n00:16:25.958 --> 00:16:27.958\nThank you very much indeed.\n\n00:16:27.958 --> 00:16:28.958\n(Applause)"}, {"title": "A brain in a supercomputer", "duration": "890", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/henry_markram_supercomputing_the_brain_s_secrets", "transcript": "Our mission is to build a detailed, realistic computer model of the human brain. And we've done, in the past four years, a proof of concept on a small part of the rodent brain, and with this proof of concept we are now scaling the project up to reach the human brain.Why are we doing this? There are three important reasons. The first is, it's essential for us to understand the human brain if we do want to get along in society, and I think that it is a key step in evolution. The second reason is, we cannot keep doing animal experimentation forever, and we have to embody all our data and all our knowledge into a working model. It's like a Noah's Ark. It's like an archive. And the third reason is that there are two billion people on the planet that are affected by mental disorder, and the drugs that are used today are largely empirical. I think that we can come up with very concrete solutions on how to treat disorders.Now, even at this stage, we can use the brain model to explore some fundamental questions about how the brain works. And here, at TED, for the first time, I'd like to share with you how we're addressing one theory \u2014 there are many theories \u2014 one theory of how the brain works. So, this theory is that the brain creates, builds, a version of the universe, and projects this version of the universe, like a bubble, all around us.Now, this is of course a topic of philosophical debate for centuries. But, for the first time, we can actually address this, with brain simulation, and ask very systematic and rigorous questions, whether this theory could possibly be true. The reason why the moon is huge on the horizon is simply because our perceptual bubble does not stretch out 380,000 kilometers. It runs out of space. And so what we do is we compare the buildings within our perceptual bubble, and we make a decision. We make a decision it's that big, even though it's not that big.And what that illustrates is that decisions are the key things that support our perceptual bubble. It keeps it alive. Without decisions you cannot see, you cannot think, you cannot feel. And you may think that anesthetics work by sending you into some deep sleep, or by blocking your receptors so that you don't feel pain, but in fact most anesthetics don't work that way. What they do is they introduce a noise into the brain so that the neurons cannot understand each other. They are confused, and you cannot make a decision. So, while you're trying to make up your mind what the doctor, the surgeon, is doing while he's hacking away at your body, he's long gone. He's at home having tea. (Laughter)So, when you walk up to a door and you open it, what you compulsively have to do to perceive is to make decisions, thousands of decisions about the size of the room, the walls, the height, the objects in this room. 99 percent of what you see is not what comes in through the eyes. It is what you infer about that room. So I can say, with some certainty, \"I think, therefore I am.\" But I cannot say, \"You think, therefore you are,\" because \"you\" are within my perceptual bubble.Now, we can speculate and philosophize this, but we don't actually have to for the next hundred years. We can ask a very concrete question. \"Can the brain build such a perception?\" Is it capable of doing it? Does it have the substance to do it? And that's what I'm going to describe to you today.So, it took the universe 11 billion years to build the brain. It had to improve it a little bit. It had to add to the frontal part, so that you would have instincts, because they had to cope on land. But the real big step was the neocortex. It's a new brain. You needed it. The mammals needed it because they had to cope with parenthood, social interactions, complex cognitive functions.So, you can think of the neocortex actually as the ultimate solution today, of the universe as we know it. It's the pinnacle, it's the final product that the universe has produced. It was so successful in evolution that from mouse to man it expanded about a thousandfold in terms of the numbers of neurons, to produce this almost frightening organ, structure. And it has not stopped its evolutionary path. In fact, the neocortex in the human brain is evolving at an enormous speed.If you zoom into the surface of the neocortex, you discover that it's made up of little modules, G5 processors, like in a computer. But there are about a million of them. They were so successful in evolution that what we did was to duplicate them over and over and add more and more of them to the brain until we ran out of space in the skull. And the brain started to fold in on itself, and that's why the neocortex is so highly convoluted. We're just packing in columns, so that we'd have more neocortical columns to perform more complex functions.So you can think of the neocortex actually as a massive grand piano, a million-key grand piano. Each of these neocortical columns would produce a note. You stimulate it; it produces a symphony. But it's not just a symphony of perception. It's a symphony of your universe, your reality. Now, of course it takes years to learn how to master a grand piano with a million keys. That's why you have to send your kids to good schools, hopefully eventually to Oxford. But it's not only education. It's also genetics. You may be born lucky, where you know how to master your neocortical column, and you can play a fantastic symphony.In fact, there is a new theory of autism called the \"intense world\" theory, which suggests that the neocortical columns are super-columns. They are highly reactive, and they are super-plastic, and so the autists are probably capable of building and learning a symphony which is unthinkable for us. But you can also understand that if you have a disease within one of these columns, the note is going to be off. The perception, the symphony that you create is going to be corrupted, and you will have symptoms of disease.So, the Holy Grail for neuroscience is really to understand the design of the neocoritical column \u2014 and it's not just for neuroscience; it's perhaps to understand perception, to understand reality, and perhaps to even also understand physical reality. So, what we did was, for the past 15 years, was to dissect out the neocortex, systematically. It's a bit like going and cataloging a piece of the rainforest. How many trees does it have? What shapes are the trees? How many of each type of tree do you have? Where are they positioned?But it's a bit more than cataloging because you actually have to describe and discover all the rules of communication, the rules of connectivity, because the neurons don't just like to connect with any neuron. They choose very carefully who they connect with. It's also more than cataloging because you actually have to build three-dimensional digital models of them. And we did that for tens of thousands of neurons, built digital models of all the different types of neurons we came across. And once you have that, you can actually begin to build the neocortical column.And here we're coiling them up. But as you do this, what you see is that the branches intersect actually in millions of locations, and at each of these intersections they can form a synapse. And a synapse is a chemical location where they communicate with each other. And these synapses together form the network or the circuit of the brain. Now, the circuit, you could also think of as the fabric of the brain. And when you think of the fabric of the brain, the structure, how is it built? What is the pattern of the carpet? You realize that this poses a fundamental challenge to any theory of the brain, and especially to a theory that says that there is some reality that emerges out of this carpet, out of this particular carpet with a particular pattern.The reason is because the most important design secret of the brain is diversity. Every neuron is different. It's the same in the forest. Every pine tree is different. You may have many different types of trees, but every pine tree is different. And in the brain it's the same. So there is no neuron in my brain that is the same as another, and there is no neuron in my brain that is the same as in yours. And your neurons are not going to be oriented and positioned in exactly the same way. And you may have more or less neurons. So it's very unlikely that you got the same fabric, the same circuitry.So, how could we possibly create a reality that we can even understand each other? Well, we don't have to speculate. We can look at all 10 million synapses now. We can look at the fabric. And we can change neurons. We can use different neurons with different variations. We can position them in different places, orient them in different places. We can use less or more of them. And when we do that what we discovered is that the circuitry does change. But the pattern of how the circuitry is designed does not. So, the fabric of the brain, even though your brain may be smaller, bigger, it may have different types of neurons, different morphologies of neurons, we actually do share the same fabric. And we think this is species-specific, which means that that could explain why we can't communicate across species.So, let's switch it on. But to do it, what you have to do is you have to make this come alive. We make it come alive with equations, a lot of mathematics. And, in fact, the equations that make neurons into electrical generators were discovered by two Cambridge Nobel Laureates. So, we have the mathematics to make neurons come alive. We also have the mathematics to describe how neurons collect information, and how they create a little lightning bolt to communicate with each other. And when they get to the synapse, what they do is they effectively, literally, shock the synapse. It's like electrical shock that releases the chemicals from these synapses.And we've got the mathematics to describe this process. So we can describe the communication between the neurons. There literally are only a handful of equations that you need to simulate the activity of the neocortex. But what you do need is a very big computer. And in fact you need one laptop to do all the calculations just for one neuron. So you need 10,000 laptops. So where do you go? You go to IBM, and you get a supercomputer, because they know how to take 10,000 laptops and put it into the size of a refrigerator. So now we have this Blue Gene supercomputer. We can load up all the neurons, each one on to its processor, and fire it up, and see what happens. Take the magic carpet for a ride.Here we activate it. And this gives the first glimpse of what is happening in your brain when there is a stimulation. It's the first view. Now, when you look at that the first time, you think, \"My god. How is reality coming out of that?\" But, in fact, you can start, even though we haven't trained this neocortical column to create a specific reality. But we can ask, \"Where is the rose?\" We can ask, \"Where is it inside, if we stimulate it with a picture?\" Where is it inside the neocortex? Ultimately it's got to be there if we stimulated it with it.So, the way that we can look at that is to ignore the neurons, ignore the synapses, and look just at the raw electrical activity. Because that is what it's creating. It's creating electrical patterns. So when we did this, we indeed, for the first time, saw these ghost-like structures: electrical objects appearing within the neocortical column. And it's these electrical objects that are holding all the information about whatever stimulated it. And then when we zoomed into this, it's like a veritable universe.So the next step is just to take these brain coordinates and to project them into perceptual space. And if you do that, you will be able to step inside the reality that is created by this machine, by this piece of the brain. So, in summary, I think that the universe may have \u2014 it's possible \u2014 evolved a brain to see itself, which may be a first step in becoming aware of itself. There is a lot more to do to test these theories, and to test any other theories. But I hope that you are at least partly convinced that it is not impossible to build a brain. We can do it within 10 years, and if we do succeed, we will send to TED, in 10 years, a hologram to talk to you. Thank you.

It's like an archive.\n\n00:01:05.958 --> 00:01:08.958\nAnd the third reason is that there are two billion people on the planet\n\n00:01:08.958 --> 00:01:12.958\nthat are affected by mental disorder,\n\n00:01:12.958 --> 00:01:14.958\nand the drugs that are used today\n\n00:01:14.958 --> 00:01:16.958\nare largely empirical.\n\n00:01:16.958 --> 00:01:19.958\nI think that we can come up with very concrete solutions on\n\n00:01:19.958 --> 00:01:22.958\nhow to treat disorders.\n\n00:01:22.958 --> 00:01:25.958\nNow, even at this stage,\n\n00:01:25.958 --> 00:01:27.958\nwe can use the brain model\n\n00:01:27.958 --> 00:01:30.958\nto explore some fundamental questions\n\n00:01:30.958 --> 00:01:32.958\nabout how the brain works.\n\n00:01:32.958 --> 00:01:34.958\nAnd here, at TED, for the first time,\n\n00:01:34.958 --> 00:01:36.958\nI'd like to share with you how we're addressing\n\n00:01:36.958 --> 00:01:39.958\none theory -- there are many theories --\n\n00:01:39.958 --> 00:01:43.958\none theory of how the brain works.\n\n00:01:43.958 --> 00:01:47.958\nSo, this theory is that the brain\n\n00:01:47.958 --> 00:01:53.958\ncreates, builds, a version of the universe,\n\n00:01:53.958 --> 00:01:56.958\nand projects this version of the universe,\n\n00:01:56.958 --> 00:02:00.958\nlike a bubble, all around us.\n\n00:02:00.958 --> 00:02:04.958\nNow, this is of course a topic of philosophical debate for centuries.\n\n00:02:04.958 --> 00:02:07.958\nBut, for the first time, we can actually address this,\n\n00:02:07.958 --> 00:02:09.958\nwith brain simulation,\n\n00:02:09.958 --> 00:02:13.958\nand ask very systematic and rigorous questions,\n\n00:02:13.958 --> 00:02:17.958\nwhether this theory could possibly be true.\n\n00:02:17.958 --> 00:02:20.958\nThe reason why the moon is huge on the horizon\n\n00:02:20.958 --> 00:02:23.958\nis simply because our perceptual bubble\n\n00:02:23.958 --> 00:02:27.958\ndoes not stretch out 380,000 kilometers.\n\n00:02:27.958 --> 00:02:29.958\nIt runs out of space.\n\n00:02:29.958 --> 00:02:33.958\nAnd so what we do is we compare the buildings\n\n00:02:33.958 --> 00:02:35.958\nwithin our perceptual bubble,\n\n00:02:35.958 --> 00:02:37.958\nand we make a decision.\n\n00:02:37.958 --> 00:02:39.958\nWe make a decision it's that big,\n\n00:02:39.958 --> 00:02:41.958\neven though it's not that big.\n\n00:02:41.958 --> 00:02:43.958\nAnd what that illustrates\n\n00:02:43.958 --> 00:02:45.958\nis that decisions are the key things\n\n00:02:45.958 --> 00:02:50.958\nthat support our perceptual bubble. It keeps it alive.\n\n00:02:50.958 --> 00:02:52.958\nWithout decisions you cannot see, you cannot think,\n\n00:02:52.958 --> 00:02:54.958\nyou cannot feel.\n\n00:02:54.958 --> 00:02:56.958\nAnd you may think that anesthetics work\n\n00:02:56.958 --> 00:02:59.958\nby sending you into some deep sleep,\n\n00:02:59.958 --> 00:03:02.958\nor by blocking your receptors so that you don't feel pain,\n\n00:03:02.958 --> 00:03:05.958\nbut in fact most anesthetics don't work that way.\n\n00:03:05.958 --> 00:03:08.958\nWhat they do is they introduce a noise\n\n00:03:08.958 --> 00:03:11.958\ninto the brain so that the neurons cannot understand each other.\n\n00:03:11.958 --> 00:03:13.958\nThey are confused,\n\n00:03:13.958 --> 00:03:16.958\nand you cannot make a decision.\n\n00:03:16.958 --> 00:03:19.958\nSo, while you're trying to make up your mind\n\n00:03:19.958 --> 00:03:21.958\nwhat the doctor, the surgeon, is doing\n\n00:03:21.958 --> 00:03:23.958\nwhile he's hacking away at your body, he's long gone.\n\n00:03:23.958 --> 00:03:25.958\nHe's at home having tea.\n\n00:03:25.958 --> 00:03:27.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:03:27.958 --> 00:03:30.958\nSo, when you walk up to a door and you open it,\n\n00:03:30.958 --> 00:03:33.958\nwhat you compulsively have to do to perceive\n\n00:03:33.958 --> 00:03:35.958\nis to make decisions,\n\n00:03:35.958 --> 00:03:38.958\nthousands of decisions about the size of the room,\n\n00:03:38.958 --> 00:03:41.958\nthe walls, the height, the objects in this room.\n\n00:03:41.958 --> 00:03:44.958\n99 percent of what you see\n\n00:03:44.958 --> 00:03:48.958\nis not what comes in through the eyes.\n\n00:03:48.958 --> 00:03:52.958\nIt is what you infer about that room.\n\n00:03:52.958 --> 00:03:56.958\nSo I can say, with some certainty,\n\n00:03:56.958 --> 00:03:59.958\n\"I think, therefore I am.\"\n\n00:03:59.958 --> 00:04:03.958\nBut I cannot say, \"You think, therefore you are,\"\n\n00:04:03.958 --> 00:04:08.958\nbecause \"you\" are within my perceptual bubble.\n\n00:04:08.958 --> 00:04:11.958\nNow, we can speculate and philosophize this,\n\n00:04:11.958 --> 00:04:14.958\nbut we don't actually have to for the next hundred years.\n\n00:04:14.958 --> 00:04:16.958\nWe can ask a very concrete question.\n\n00:04:16.958 --> 00:04:20.958\n\"Can the brain build such a perception?\"\n\n00:04:20.958 --> 00:04:22.958\nIs it capable of doing it?\n\n00:04:22.958 --> 00:04:24.958\nDoes it have the substance to do it?\n\n00:04:24.958 --> 00:04:27.958\nAnd that's what I'm going to describe to you today.\n\n00:04:27.958 --> 00:04:31.958\nSo, it took the universe 11 billion years to build the brain.\n\n00:04:31.958 --> 00:04:33.958\nIt had to improve it a little bit.\n\n00:04:33.958 --> 00:04:36.958\nIt had to add to the frontal part, so that you would have instincts,\n\n00:04:36.958 --> 00:04:39.958\nbecause they had to cope on land.\n\n00:04:39.958 --> 00:04:43.958\nBut the real big step was the neocortex.\n\n00:04:43.958 --> 00:04:45.958\nIt's a new brain. You needed it.\n\n00:04:45.958 --> 00:04:47.958\nThe mammals needed it\n\n00:04:47.958 --> 00:04:51.958\nbecause they had to cope with parenthood,\n\n00:04:51.958 --> 00:04:53.958\nsocial interactions,\n\n00:04:53.958 --> 00:04:56.958\ncomplex cognitive functions.\n\n00:04:56.958 --> 00:04:58.958\nSo, you can think of the neocortex\n\n00:04:58.958 --> 00:05:03.958\nactually as the ultimate solution today,\n\n00:05:03.958 --> 00:05:06.958\nof the universe as we know it.\n\n00:05:06.958 --> 00:05:08.958\nIt's the pinnacle, it's the final product\n\n00:05:08.958 --> 00:05:12.958\nthat the universe has produced.\n\n00:05:12.958 --> 00:05:14.958\nIt was so successful in evolution\n\n00:05:14.958 --> 00:05:16.958\nthat from mouse to man it expanded\n\n00:05:16.958 --> 00:05:19.958\nabout a thousandfold in terms of the numbers of neurons,\n\n00:05:19.958 --> 00:05:22.958\nto produce this almost frightening\n\n00:05:22.958 --> 00:05:25.958\norgan, structure.\n\n00:05:25.958 --> 00:05:28.958\nAnd it has not stopped its evolutionary path.\n\n00:05:28.958 --> 00:05:30.958\nIn fact, the neocortex in the human brain\n\n00:05:30.958 --> 00:05:33.958\nis evolving at an enormous speed.\n\n00:05:33.958 --> 00:05:35.958\nIf you zoom into the surface of the neocortex,\n\n00:05:35.958 --> 00:05:38.958\nyou discover that it's made up of little modules,\n\n00:05:38.958 --> 00:05:40.958\nG5 processors, like in a computer.\n\n00:05:40.958 --> 00:05:43.958\nBut there are about a million of them.\n\n00:05:43.958 --> 00:05:45.958\nThey were so successful in evolution\n\n00:05:45.958 --> 00:05:47.958\nthat what we did was to duplicate them\n\n00:05:47.958 --> 00:05:49.958\nover and over and add more and more of them to the brain\n\n00:05:49.958 --> 00:05:52.958\nuntil we ran out of space in the skull.\n\n00:05:52.958 --> 00:05:54.958\nAnd the brain started to fold in on itself,\n\n00:05:54.958 --> 00:05:57.958\nand that's why the neocortex is so highly convoluted.\n\n00:05:57.958 --> 00:05:59.958\nWe're just packing in columns,\n\n00:05:59.958 --> 00:06:02.958\nso that we'd have more neocortical columns\n\n00:06:02.958 --> 00:06:05.958\nto perform more complex functions.\n\n00:06:05.958 --> 00:06:07.958\nSo you can think of the neocortex actually as\n\n00:06:07.958 --> 00:06:09.958\na massive grand piano,\n\n00:06:09.958 --> 00:06:12.958\na million-key grand piano.\n\n00:06:12.958 --> 00:06:14.958\nEach of these neocortical columns\n\n00:06:14.958 --> 00:06:16.958\nwould produce a note.\n\n00:06:16.958 --> 00:06:19.958\nYou stimulate it; it produces a symphony.\n\n00:06:19.958 --> 00:06:22.958\nBut it's not just a symphony of perception.\n\n00:06:22.958 --> 00:06:25.958\nIt's a symphony of your universe, your reality.\n\n00:06:25.958 --> 00:06:28.958\nNow, of course it takes years to learn how\n\n00:06:28.958 --> 00:06:31.958\nto master a grand piano with a million keys.\n\n00:06:31.958 --> 00:06:33.958\nThat's why you have to send your kids to good schools,\n\n00:06:33.958 --> 00:06:35.958\nhopefully eventually to Oxford.\n\n00:06:35.958 --> 00:06:38.958\nBut it's not only education.\n\n00:06:38.958 --> 00:06:40.958\nIt's also genetics.\n\n00:06:40.958 --> 00:06:42.958\nYou may be born lucky,\n\n00:06:42.958 --> 00:06:46.958\nwhere you know how to master your neocortical column,\n\n00:06:46.958 --> 00:06:48.958\nand you can play a fantastic symphony.\n\n00:06:48.958 --> 00:06:51.958\nIn fact, there is a new theory of autism\n\n00:06:51.958 --> 00:06:53.958\ncalled the \"intense world\" theory,\n\n00:06:53.958 --> 00:06:57.958\nwhich suggests that the neocortical columns are super-columns.\n\n00:06:57.958 --> 00:07:01.958\nThey are highly reactive, and they are super-plastic,\n\n00:07:01.958 --> 00:07:04.958\nand so the autists are probably capable of\n\n00:07:04.958 --> 00:07:06.958\nbuilding and learning a symphony\n\n00:07:06.958 --> 00:07:08.958\nwhich is unthinkable for us.\n\n00:07:08.958 --> 00:07:10.958\nBut you can also understand\n\n00:07:10.958 --> 00:07:12.958\nthat if you have a disease\n\n00:07:12.958 --> 00:07:14.958\nwithin one of these columns,\n\n00:07:14.958 --> 00:07:16.958\nthe note is going to be off.\n\n00:07:16.958 --> 00:07:18.958\nThe perception, the symphony that you create\n\n00:07:18.958 --> 00:07:20.958\nis going to be corrupted,\n\n00:07:20.958 --> 00:07:23.958\nand you will have symptoms of disease.\n\n00:07:23.958 --> 00:07:27.958\nSo, the Holy Grail for neuroscience\n\n00:07:27.958 --> 00:07:31.958\nis really to understand the design of the neocoritical column --\n\n00:07:31.958 --> 00:07:33.958\nand it's not just for neuroscience;\n\n00:07:33.958 --> 00:07:36.958\nit's perhaps to understand perception, to understand reality,\n\n00:07:36.958 --> 00:07:40.958\nand perhaps to even also understand physical reality.\n\n00:07:40.958 --> 00:07:43.958\nSo, what we did was, for the past 15 years,\n\n00:07:43.958 --> 00:07:47.958\nwas to dissect out the neocortex, systematically.\n\n00:07:47.958 --> 00:07:51.958\nIt's a bit like going and cataloging a piece of the rainforest.\n\n00:07:51.958 --> 00:07:53.958\nHow many trees does it have?\n\n00:07:53.958 --> 00:07:55.958\nWhat shapes are the trees?\n\n00:07:55.958 --> 00:07:58.958\nHow many of each type of tree do you have? Where are they positioned?\n\n00:07:58.958 --> 00:08:00.958\nBut it's a bit more than cataloging because you actually have to\n\n00:08:00.958 --> 00:08:04.958\ndescribe and discover all the rules of communication,\n\n00:08:04.958 --> 00:08:06.958\nthe rules of connectivity,\n\n00:08:06.958 --> 00:08:09.958\nbecause the neurons don't just like to connect with any neuron.\n\n00:08:09.958 --> 00:08:12.958\nThey choose very carefully who they connect with.\n\n00:08:12.958 --> 00:08:15.958\nIt's also more than cataloging\n\n00:08:15.958 --> 00:08:17.958\nbecause you actually have to build three-dimensional\n\n00:08:17.958 --> 00:08:19.958\ndigital models of them.\n\n00:08:19.958 --> 00:08:21.958\nAnd we did that for tens of thousands of neurons,\n\n00:08:21.958 --> 00:08:24.958\nbuilt digital models of all the different types\n\n00:08:24.958 --> 00:08:26.958\nof neurons we came across.\n\n00:08:26.958 --> 00:08:28.958\nAnd once you have that, you can actually\n\n00:08:28.958 --> 00:08:32.958\nbegin to build the neocortical column.\n\n00:08:32.958 --> 00:08:35.958\nAnd here we're coiling them up.\n\n00:08:35.958 --> 00:08:38.958\nBut as you do this, what you see\n\n00:08:38.958 --> 00:08:40.958\nis that the branches intersect\n\n00:08:40.958 --> 00:08:43.958\nactually in millions of locations,\n\n00:08:43.958 --> 00:08:46.958\nand at each of these intersections\n\n00:08:46.958 --> 00:08:48.958\nthey can form a synapse.\n\n00:08:48.958 --> 00:08:50.958\nAnd a synapse is a chemical location\n\n00:08:50.958 --> 00:08:53.958\nwhere they communicate with each other.\n\n00:08:53.958 --> 00:08:55.958\nAnd these synapses together\n\n00:08:55.958 --> 00:08:57.958\nform the network\n\n00:08:57.958 --> 00:09:00.958\nor the circuit of the brain.\n\n00:09:00.958 --> 00:09:04.958\nNow, the circuit, you could also think of as\n\n00:09:04.958 --> 00:09:06.958\nthe fabric of the brain.\n\n00:09:06.958 --> 00:09:09.958\nAnd when you think of the fabric of the brain,\n\n00:09:09.958 --> 00:09:13.958\nthe structure, how is it built? What is the pattern of the carpet?\n\n00:09:13.958 --> 00:09:15.958\nYou realize that this poses\n\n00:09:15.958 --> 00:09:19.958\na fundamental challenge to any theory of the brain,\n\n00:09:19.958 --> 00:09:21.958\nand especially to a theory that says\n\n00:09:21.958 --> 00:09:23.958\nthat there is some reality that emerges\n\n00:09:23.958 --> 00:09:26.958\nout of this carpet, out of this particular carpet\n\n00:09:26.958 --> 00:09:28.958\nwith a particular pattern.\n\n00:09:28.958 --> 00:09:31.958\nThe reason is because the most important design secret of the brain\n\n00:09:31.958 --> 00:09:33.958\nis diversity.\n\n00:09:33.958 --> 00:09:35.958\nEvery neuron is different.\n\n00:09:35.958 --> 00:09:37.958\nIt's the same in the forest. Every pine tree is different.\n\n00:09:37.958 --> 00:09:39.958\nYou may have many different types of trees,\n\n00:09:39.958 --> 00:09:42.958\nbut every pine tree is different. And in the brain it's the same.\n\n00:09:42.958 --> 00:09:45.958\nSo there is no neuron in my brain that is the same as another,\n\n00:09:45.958 --> 00:09:48.958\nand there is no neuron in my brain that is the same as in yours.\n\n00:09:48.958 --> 00:09:51.958\nAnd your neurons are not going to be oriented and positioned\n\n00:09:51.958 --> 00:09:53.958\nin exactly the same way.\n\n00:09:53.958 --> 00:09:55.958\nAnd you may have more or less neurons.\n\n00:09:55.958 --> 00:09:57.958\nSo it's very unlikely\n\n00:09:57.958 --> 00:10:01.958\nthat you got the same fabric, the same circuitry.\n\n00:10:01.958 --> 00:10:03.958\nSo, how could we possibly create a reality\n\n00:10:03.958 --> 00:10:06.958\nthat we can even understand each other?\n\n00:10:06.958 --> 00:10:08.958\nWell, we don't have to speculate.\n\n00:10:08.958 --> 00:10:11.958\nWe can look at all 10 million synapses now.\n\n00:10:11.958 --> 00:10:14.958\nWe can look at the fabric. And we can change neurons.\n\n00:10:14.958 --> 00:10:16.958\nWe can use different neurons with different variations.\n\n00:10:16.958 --> 00:10:18.958\nWe can position them in different places,\n\n00:10:18.958 --> 00:10:20.958\norient them in different places.\n\n00:10:20.958 --> 00:10:22.958\nWe can use less or more of them.\n\n00:10:22.958 --> 00:10:24.958\nAnd when we do that\n\n00:10:24.958 --> 00:10:27.958\nwhat we discovered is that the circuitry does change.\n\n00:10:27.958 --> 00:10:34.958\nBut the pattern of how the circuitry is designed does not.\n\n00:10:34.958 --> 00:10:36.958\nSo, the fabric of the brain,\n\n00:10:36.958 --> 00:10:38.958\neven though your brain may be smaller, bigger,\n\n00:10:38.958 --> 00:10:41.958\nit may have different types of neurons,\n\n00:10:41.958 --> 00:10:43.958\ndifferent morphologies of neurons,\n\n00:10:43.958 --> 00:10:46.958\nwe actually do share\n\n00:10:46.958 --> 00:10:48.958\nthe same fabric.\n\n00:10:48.958 --> 00:10:50.958\nAnd we think this is species-specific,\n\n00:10:50.958 --> 00:10:52.958\nwhich means that that could explain\n\n00:10:52.958 --> 00:10:54.958\nwhy we can't communicate across species.\n\n00:10:54.958 --> 00:10:57.958\nSo, let's switch it on. But to do it, what you have to do\n\n00:10:57.958 --> 00:10:59.958\nis you have to make this come alive.\n\n00:10:59.958 --> 00:11:01.958\nWe make it come alive\n\n00:11:01.958 --> 00:11:03.958\nwith equations, a lot of mathematics.\n\n00:11:03.958 --> 00:11:07.958\nAnd, in fact, the equations that make neurons into electrical generators\n\n00:11:07.958 --> 00:11:10.958\nwere discovered by two Cambridge Nobel Laureates.\n\n00:11:10.958 --> 00:11:13.958\nSo, we have the mathematics to make neurons come alive.\n\n00:11:13.958 --> 00:11:15.958\nWe also have the mathematics to describe\n\n00:11:15.958 --> 00:11:18.958\nhow neurons collect information,\n\n00:11:18.958 --> 00:11:21.958\nand how they create a little lightning bolt\n\n00:11:21.958 --> 00:11:23.958\nto communicate with each other.\n\n00:11:23.958 --> 00:11:25.958\nAnd when they get to the synapse,\n\n00:11:25.958 --> 00:11:27.958\nwhat they do is they effectively,\n\n00:11:27.958 --> 00:11:30.958\nliterally, shock the synapse.\n\n00:11:30.958 --> 00:11:32.958\nIt's like electrical shock\n\n00:11:32.958 --> 00:11:35.958\nthat releases the chemicals from these synapses.\n\n00:11:35.958 --> 00:11:38.958\nAnd we've got the mathematics to describe this process.\n\n00:11:38.958 --> 00:11:42.958\nSo we can describe the communication between the neurons.\n\n00:11:42.958 --> 00:11:45.958\nThere literally are only a handful\n\n00:11:45.958 --> 00:11:47.958\nof equations that you need to simulate\n\n00:11:47.958 --> 00:11:49.958\nthe activity of the neocortex.\n\n00:11:49.958 --> 00:11:52.958\nBut what you do need is a very big computer.\n\n00:11:52.958 --> 00:11:54.958\nAnd in fact you need one laptop\n\n00:11:54.958 --> 00:11:57.958\nto do all the calculations just for one neuron.\n\n00:11:57.958 --> 00:11:59.958\nSo you need 10,000 laptops.\n\n00:11:59.958 --> 00:12:01.958\nSo where do you go? You go to IBM,\n\n00:12:01.958 --> 00:12:03.958\nand you get a supercomputer, because they know how to take\n\n00:12:03.958 --> 00:12:07.958\n10,000 laptops and put it into the size of a refrigerator.\n\n00:12:07.958 --> 00:12:10.958\nSo now we have this Blue Gene supercomputer.\n\n00:12:10.958 --> 00:12:12.958\nWe can load up all the neurons,\n\n00:12:12.958 --> 00:12:14.958\neach one on to its processor,\n\n00:12:14.958 --> 00:12:18.958\nand fire it up, and see what happens.\n\n00:12:18.958 --> 00:12:21.958\nTake the magic carpet for a ride.\n\n00:12:21.958 --> 00:12:24.958\nHere we activate it. And this gives the first glimpse\n\n00:12:24.958 --> 00:12:26.958\nof what is happening in your brain\n\n00:12:26.958 --> 00:12:28.958\nwhen there is a stimulation.\n\n00:12:28.958 --> 00:12:30.958\nIt's the first view.\n\n00:12:30.958 --> 00:12:32.958\nNow, when you look at that the first time, you think,\n\n00:12:32.958 --> 00:12:37.958\n\"My god. How is reality coming out of that?\"\n\n00:12:37.958 --> 00:12:40.958\nBut, in fact, you can start,\n\n00:12:40.958 --> 00:12:44.958\neven though we haven't trained this neocortical column\n\n00:12:44.958 --> 00:12:46.958\nto create a specific reality.\n\n00:12:46.958 --> 00:12:50.958\nBut we can ask, \"Where is the rose?\"\n\n00:12:50.958 --> 00:12:52.958\nWe can ask, \"Where is it inside,\n\n00:12:52.958 --> 00:12:55.958\nif we stimulate it with a picture?\"\n\n00:12:55.958 --> 00:12:57.958\nWhere is it inside the neocortex?\n\n00:12:57.958 --> 00:13:01.958\nUltimately it's got to be there if we stimulated it with it.\n\n00:13:01.958 --> 00:13:03.958\nSo, the way that we can look at that\n\n00:13:03.958 --> 00:13:06.958\nis to ignore the neurons, ignore the synapses,\n\n00:13:06.958 --> 00:13:08.958\nand look just at the raw electrical activity.\n\n00:13:08.958 --> 00:13:10.958\nBecause that is what it's creating.\n\n00:13:10.958 --> 00:13:12.958\nIt's creating electrical patterns.\n\n00:13:12.958 --> 00:13:14.958\nSo when we did this,\n\n00:13:14.958 --> 00:13:16.958\nwe indeed, for the first time,\n\n00:13:16.958 --> 00:13:19.958\nsaw these ghost-like structures:\n\n00:13:19.958 --> 00:13:22.958\nelectrical objects appearing\n\n00:13:22.958 --> 00:13:25.958\nwithin the neocortical column.\n\n00:13:25.958 --> 00:13:28.958\nAnd it's these electrical objects\n\n00:13:28.958 --> 00:13:31.958\nthat are holding all the information about\n\n00:13:31.958 --> 00:13:34.958\nwhatever stimulated it.\n\n00:13:34.958 --> 00:13:36.958\nAnd then when we zoomed into this,\n\n00:13:36.958 --> 00:13:40.958\nit's like a veritable universe.\n\n00:13:40.958 --> 00:13:42.958\nSo the next step\n\n00:13:42.958 --> 00:13:46.958\nis just to take these brain coordinates\n\n00:13:46.958 --> 00:13:50.958\nand to project them into perceptual space.\n\n00:13:50.958 --> 00:13:52.958\nAnd if you do that,\n\n00:13:52.958 --> 00:13:54.958\nyou will be able to step inside\n\n00:13:54.958 --> 00:13:56.958\nthe reality that is created\n\n00:13:56.958 --> 00:13:58.958\nby this machine,\n\n00:13:58.958 --> 00:14:01.958\nby this piece of the brain.\n\n00:14:01.958 --> 00:14:03.958\nSo, in summary,\n\n00:14:03.958 --> 00:14:05.958\nI think that the universe may have --\n\n00:14:05.958 --> 00:14:07.958\nit's possible --\n\n00:14:07.958 --> 00:14:10.958\nevolved a brain to see itself,\n\n00:14:10.958 --> 00:14:15.958\nwhich may be a first step in becoming aware of itself.\n\n00:14:15.958 --> 00:14:17.958\nThere is a lot more to do to test these theories,\n\n00:14:17.958 --> 00:14:20.958\nand to test any other theories.\n\n00:14:20.958 --> 00:14:23.958\nBut I hope that you are at least partly convinced\n\n00:14:23.958 --> 00:14:26.958\nthat it is not impossible to build a brain.\n\n00:14:26.958 --> 00:14:28.958\nWe can do it within 10 years,\n\n00:14:28.958 --> 00:14:30.958\nand if we do succeed,\n\n00:14:30.958 --> 00:14:32.958\nwe will send to TED, in 10 years,\n\n00:14:32.958 --> 00:14:35.958\na hologram to talk to you.

Let me start with the observation that most of the sound around us is accidental; much of it is unpleasant. (Traffic noise) We stand on street corners, shouting over noise like this, pretending it doesn't exist. This habit of suppressing sound has meant that our relationship with sound has become largely unconscious.There are four major ways sound is affecting you all the time, and I'd like to raise them in your consciousness today. The first is physiological.(Alarm clocks ring)Sorry about that. I just gave you a shot of cortisol, your fight-flight hormone. Sounds are affecting your hormone secretions all the time, but also your breathing, heart rate \u2014 which I just also did \u2014 and your brainwaves.It's not just unpleasant sounds like that that do it. This is surf. (Ocean waves) It has the frequency of roughly 12 cycles per minute. Most people find that very soothing, and, interestingly, 12 cycles per minute is roughly the frequency of the breathing of a sleeping human, so there is a deep resonance with being at rest. We also associate it with being stress-free and on holiday.The second way in which sound affects you is psychological. Music is the most powerful form of sound that we know that affects our emotional state. (Albinoni's Adagio) This is guaranteed to make most of you feel pretty sad if I leave it on. Music is not the only kind of sound, however, which affects your emotions.Natural sound can do that, too. Birdsong, for example, is a sound which most people find reassuring. There's a reason: over hundreds of thousands of years we've learned that when the birds are singing, things are safe. It's when they stop you need to be worried.The third way in which sound affects you is cognitively. You can't understand two people talking at once (Voice-over) or in this case, one person talking twice. You have to choose which me you're going to listen to.We have a very small amount of bandwidth for processing auditory input, which is why noise like this ...(Office noise)is extremely damaging for productivity. If you have to work in an open-plan office like this, your productivity is greatly reduced. And whatever number you're thinking of, it probably isn't as bad as this.[Open-plan offices productivity down 66%]You are one-third as productive in open-plan offices as in quiet rooms. I have a tip for you: if you work in spaces like that, carry headphones with you, with a soothing sound like birdsong. Put them on, and your productivity goes back up to triple what it would be.The fourth way in which sound affects us is behaviorally. With all that other stuff going on, it would be amazing if our behavior didn't change.(Techno music)So ask yourself: Is this person ever going to drive at a steady 28 miles per hour? I don't think so. At the simplest, you move away from unpleasant sound and towards pleasant sounds. So if I were to play this ...(Jackhammer)for more than a few seconds, you'd feel uncomfortable; for more than a few minutes, you'd be leaving the room in droves. For people who can't get away from noise like that, it's extremely damaging for their health.And that's not the only thing that bad sound damages. Most retail sound is inappropriate and accidental, even hostile, and it has a dramatic effect on sales. For you retailers, you may want to look away before I show this slide.[Inappropriate retail soundscapes sales down 28%]They're losing up to 30 percent of their business with people leaving shops faster, or just turning around at the door. We've all done it, left the area, because the sound in there is so dreadful.I want to spend just a moment talking about the model we've developed, which allows us to start at the top and look at the drivers of sound, analyze the soundscape and then predict the four outcomes I just talked about. Or start at the bottom and say what outcomes we want, and then design a soundscape to have a desired effect. At last we've got some science we can apply. And we're in the business of designing soundscapes.Just a word on music. Music is the most powerful sound there is, often inappropriately deployed. It's powerful for two reasons: you recognize it fast, and you associate it very powerfully. I'll give you two examples.(First chord of \"A Hard Day's Night\")Most of you recognize that immediately. The younger, maybe not.(Laughter)(First notes of \"Jaws\" theme)Most of you associate that with something! Now, those are one-second samples of music. Music is very powerful, and unfortunately, it's veneering commercial spaces, often inappropriately. I hope that's going to change over the next few years.Let me talk about brands for a moment, since some of you run brands. Every brand is out there making sound right now. There are eight expressions of a brand in sound; they're all important. And every brand needs to have guidelines at the center. I'm glad to say that is starting to happen now.(Intel ad jingle)You all recognize that one.(Nokia ringtone)This is the most-played tune in the world today \u2014 1.8 billion times a day, that tune is played.(Laughter)And it cost Nokia absolutely nothing.I'll leave you with four golden rules, for those of you who run businesses, for commercial sound. First, make it congruent, pointing in the same direction as your visual communication. That increases impact by over 1,100 percent. If your sound is pointing the opposite direction, incongruent, you reduce impact by 86 percent. That's an order of magnitude, up or down. This is important. Secondly, make it appropriate to the situation. Thirdly, make it valuable. Give people something with the sound, don't just bombard them with stuff. Finally, test and test it again. Sound is complex; there are many countervailing influences. It can be a bit like a bowl of spaghetti: sometimes you just have to eat it and see what happens.So I hope this talk has raised sound in your consciousness. If you're listening consciously, you can take control of the sound around you. It's good for your health and for your productivity. If we all do that, we move to a state that I like to think will be sound living in the world. I'll leave you with more birdsong.

sound is pointing\nthe opposite direction, incongruent,\n\n00:04:51.958 --> 00:04:53.934\nyou reduce impact by 86 percent.\n\n00:04:53.958 --> 00:04:56.644\nThat's an order of magnitude, up or down.\n\n00:04:56.668 --> 00:04:58.152\nThis is important.\n\n00:04:58.176 --> 00:05:00.934\nSecondly, make it appropriate\nto the situation.\n\n00:05:00.958 --> 00:05:02.215\nThirdly, make it

again.\n\n00:05:07.314 --> 00:05:10.098\nSound is complex; there are many\ncountervailing influences.\n\n00:05:10.122 --> 00:05:12.099\nIt can be a bit like a bowl of spaghetti:\n\n00:05:12.123 -->

"https://www.ted.com/talks/john_gerzema_the_post_crisis_consumer", "transcript": "Thirteen trillion dollars in wealth has evaporated over the course of the last two years. We've questioned the future of capitalism. We've questioned the financial industry. We've looked at our government oversight. We've questioned where we're going. And yet, at the same time, this very well may be a seminal moment in American history, an opportunity for the consumer to actually take control and guide us to a new trajectory in America.I'm calling this The Great Unwind.(Laughter)And the idea is a simple, simple idea, which is the fact that the consumer has moved from a state of anxiety to action. Consumers who represent 72 percent of the GDP of America have actually started, just like banks and just like businesses, to de-leverage, to unwind their leverage in daily life, to remove themselves from the liability and risk that presents itself as they move forward.So, to understand this \u2014 and I'm going to stress this \u2014 it's not about the consumer being in retreat. The consumer is empowered. To understand this, we'll step back and look at what's happened over the last year and a half. So if you've been gone, this is the CliffsNotes on what's happened in the economy.(Laughter)Unemployment up. Housing values down. Equity markets down. Commodity prices are like this.If you're a mom trying to manage a budget, and oil was 150 dollars a barrel last summer, and it's somewhere between 50 and 70, do you plan vacations? How do you buy? What's your strategy in your household? Will the bailout work? We have national debt, Detroit, currency valuations, health care \u2014 all these issues facing us. You put them all together, mix them up in a bouillabaisse, and you have consumer confidence that's basically a ticking time bomb.In fact, let's go back and look at what caused this crisis, because the consumer, all of us, in our daily lives, actually contributed a large part to the problem. This is something I call the 50-20 paradox. It took us 50 years to reach annual savings ratings of almost 10 percent. Fifty years. Do you know what this was right here? This was World War II. Do you know why savings was so high? There was nothing to buy, unless you wanted to buy some rivets.What happened, though, over the course of the last 20 years, we went from a 10 percent savings rate to a negative savings rate. Because we binged. We bought extra-large cars, supersized everything, we bought remedies for restless leg syndrome. All these things together basically created a factor where the consumer drove us headlong into the crisis that we face today. The personal debt-to-income ratio basically went from 65 to 135 percent in the span of about 15 years. So consumers got over-leveraged. And of course our banks did as well, as did our federal government.This is an absolutely staggering chart. It shows leverage, trended out from 1919 to 2009. And what you end up seeing is the whole phenomenon that we are actually stepping forth and basically leveraging future education, future children in our households.So if you look at this in the context of visualizing the bailout, what you can see is, if you stack up dollar bills, first of all, 360,000 dollars is about the size of a five-foot-four guy. But if you stack it up, you see this amazing, staggering amount of dollars that have been put into the system to fund and bail us out. So this is the first 315 billion. But I read this fact the other day, that one trillion seconds equals 32,000 years. So if you think about that, the context, the casualness with which we talk about trillion-dollar bailout here and trillion there, we are stacking ourselves up for long-term leverage.However, consumers have moved. They are taking responsibility. What we're seeing is an uptake in the savings rate. In fact, 11 straight months of savings have happened since the beginning of the crisis. We're working our way back up to that 10 percent. Also, remarkably, in the fourth quarter, spending dropped to its lowest level in 62 years \u2014 almost a 3.7 percent decline.Visa now reports that more people are using debit cards than credit cards. So we're starting to pay for things with money that we have. And we're starting to be much more careful about how we save and invest. But that's not really the whole story, because this has also been a dramatic time of transformation. And you've got to admit, over the last year and a half, consumers have been doing some weird things. It's pretty staggering, what we've lived through. If you take into account that 80 percent of all Americans were born after World War II, this was essentially our Depression.And so, as a result, some crazy things have happened. I'll give you some examples. Let's talk about dentists, vasectomies, guns and shark attacks.(Laughter)Dentists report molars \u2014 people grinding their teeth, coming in and reporting that they've had stress. So there's an increase in people having to have their fillings replaced. Gun sales, according to the FBI, who does background checks, are up almost 25 percent since January. Vasectomies are up 48 percent, according to the Cornell Institute. And lastly, but a very good point, hopefully not related to the former point I just made, which is that shark attacks are at their lowest level from 2003. Does anybody know why?(Laughter)No one's at the beach. So there's a bright side to everything.But seriously, what we see happening, and the reason I want to stress that the consumer is not in retreat, is that this is a tremendous opportunity for the consumer who drove us into this recession to lead us right back out. What I mean by that is we can move from mindless consumption to mindful consumption. Right?(Applause)If you think about the last three decades, the consumer has moved from savvy about marketing in the '90s, to gathering all these amazing social and search tools in this decade. But the one thing holding them back is the ability to discriminate. By restricting their demand, consumers can actually align their values with their spending, and drive capitalism and business to not just be about more, but to be about better.We're going to explain that right now. Based on Y&R's BrandAsset Valuator, proprietary tool of VML and Young & Rubicam, we set out to understand what's been happening in the crisis with the consumer marketplace. We found a couple of really interesting things. We're going to go through four value shifts that we see driving new consumer behaviors, that offer new management principles.The first cultural value shift we see is this tendency toward something we call \"liquid life.\" This is the movement from Americans defining their success on having things to having liquidity, because the less excess that you have around you, the more nimble and fleet of foot you are. As a result, d\u00e9class\u00e9 consumption is in. D\u00e9class\u00e9 consumption is the whole idea that spending money frivolously makes you look a little bit anti-fashion. The management principle is dollars and cents.So let's look at some examples of this d\u00e9class\u00e9 consumption that falls out of this value. The first thing is, something must be happening when P. Diddy vows to tone down his bling.(Laughter)But seriously, we also have this phenomenon on Madison Avenue and in other places, where people are actually walking out of luxury boutiques with ordinary, generic paper bags to hide the brand purchases. We see high-end haggling in fashion today, high-end haggling for luxury and real estate. We also see just a relaxing of ego, and sort of a dismantling of artifice.This is a story on the yacht club that's all basically blue collar. Blue-collar yacht club \u2014 where you can join, but you've got to work in the boatyard as condition of membership. We also see the trend toward tourism that's a little bit more low-key: agritourism \u2014 going to vineyards and going to farms.And then we also see this movement forward from dollars and cents. What businesses can do to connect with these new mindsets is really interesting. A couple things that are kind of cool. One is that Frito-Lay figured out this liquidity thing with their consumer. They found their consumer had more money at the beginning of the month, less at the end of the month. So they started to change their packaging: larger packs at the beginning of the month, smaller packaging at the end of the month.Really interestingly, too, was the San Francisco Giants. They've just instituted dynamic pricing. It takes into account everything from the pitcher match-ups, to the weather, to the team records, in setting prices for the consumer. Another quick example of these types of movements is the rise of Zynga. Zynga has risen on the consumer's desire to not want to be locked in to fixed cost. Again, this theme is about variable cost, variable living. So micro-payments have become huge. And lastly, some people are using Hulu as a device to get rid of their cable bill. So, really clever ideas there that are being taken ahold of and that marketers are starting to understand.The second of the four values is this movement toward ethics and fair play. We see that play itself out with empathy and respect. The consumer is demanding it. And, as a result, businesses must provide not only value, but values. Increasingly, consumers are looking at the culture of the company, at their conduct in the marketplace. So we see with empathy and respect lots of really hopeful things come out of this recession. I'll give you a few examples.One is the rise toward communities and neighborhoods, and increased emphasis on your neighbors as your support system. Also, a wonderful by-product of a really lousy thing, which has been unemployment, is a rise in volunteerism that's been noted in our country. We also see the phenomenon \u2014 some of you may have \"boomerang kids\" \u2014 these are \"boomerang alumni,\" where universities are actually reconnecting with alumni and helping them with jobs, sharing skills and retraining. We also talked about character and professionalism. We had this miracle on the Hudson in New York City in January, and suddenly Sully has become a key name on BabyCenter.(Laughter)So, from a value and values standpoint, what companies can do is connect in lots of different ways. Microsoft is doing something wonderful. They are actually vowing to retrain two million Americans with IT training, using their existing infrastructure to do something good.Also, a really interesting company is GORE-TEX. GORE-TEX is all about personal accountability of their management and their employees, to the point where they really kind of shun the idea of bosses. But they also talk about the fact that their executives \u2014 all of their expense reports are put onto their company intranet for everyone to see. Complete transparency. Think twice before you have that bottle of wine.(Laughter)The third of the four laws of post-crisis consumerism is about durable living. We're seeing in our data that consumers are realizing this is a marathon, not a sprint. They're digging in and looking for ways to extract value out of every purchase they make. Witness the fact that Americans are holding on to their cars longer than ever before: 9.4 years on average, in March. A record. We also see the fact that libraries have become a huge resource for America. Did you know that 68 percent of Americans now carry a library card? The highest percentage ever in our nation's history.So what you see in this trend is also the accumulation of knowledge. Continuing education is up. Everything is focused on betterment, training, development and moving forward. We also see a big DIY movement. I was fascinated to learn that 30 percent of all homes in America are actually built by owners. That includes cottages and the like, but 30 percent. People are getting their hands dirty, rolling up their sleeves. They want these skills.We see it with the phenomenon of raising backyard hens, chickens and ducks. And when you work out the math, they say it doesn't work, but the principle is there; it's about being sustainable and taking care of yourself. Then we look at the High Line in New York City, an excellent use of reimagining existing infrastructure for something good, which is a brand-new park in New York City.So what brands can do, and companies, is pay dividends to consumers, be a brand that lasts, offer transparency, promise you're going to be there beyond today's sale. Perfect example of that is Patagonia. Patagonia's \"Footprint Chronicles\" basically goes through and tracks every product they make, and gives you social responsibility, and helps you understand the ethics behind the product they make.Another great example is Fidelity. Rather than instant cash-back rewards on your credit or debit purchases, this is about 529 rewards for your student education. Or the interesting company Sunrun. I love this company. They've created a consumer collective where they put solar panels on households and create a consumer-based utility, where the electricity they generate is basically pumped back out into the marketplace. So it's a consumer-driven co-op.The fourth post-crisis consumerism that we see is this movement about \"return to the fold.\" It's incredibly important right now. Trust is not parceled out, as we all know. It's now about connecting to your communities, connecting to your social networks. In my book, I talked about the fact that 72 percent of people trust what other people say about a brand or a company, versus 15 percent on advertising. So in that respect, cooperative consumerism has really taken off. This is about consumers working together to get what they want out of the marketplace. Let's look at a couple of quick examples.The artisanal movement is huge: everything about locally derived products and services, supporting your local neighborhoods, whether it's cheeses, wines and other products. Also this rise of local currencies. Realizing that it's difficult to get loans in this environment, you're doing business with people you trust in your local markets. So this rise of local currency is another really interesting phenomenon. And then they did a recent report I thought was fascinating. They actually started, in certain communities in the United States, to publish people's electricity usage. And what they found out is when that was available for public record, the people's electricity usage in those communities dropped.Then we also look at the idea of cow-pooling, which is the whole phenomenon of consumers organizing together to buy meat from organic farms, that they know is safe and controlled in the way that they want it to be controlled. And then there's this other really interesting movement in California, which is about carrot mobs. The traditional thing would be to boycott, right? Have a stick. Well, why not have a carrot? So these are consumers organizing, pooling their resources to incentify companies to do good.And then we look at what companies can do. This is all the opportunity about being a community organizer. You have to realize that you can't fight and control this. You actually need to organize it. You need to harness it. You need to give it meaning. And there's lots of really interesting examples here. First is just the rise of the fact that Zagat's has actually moved out of and diversified from rating restaurants, into actually rating health care. So what credentials does Zagat's have? Well, they have a lot, because it's their network of people. So that becomes a very powerful force for them to make their brand more elastic.Then you look at the phenomenon of Kogi. This Kogi doesn't exist. It's a moving truck. It's a moving truck through L.A., and the only way you can find it is through Twitter.(Laughter)Or you look at Johnson & Johnson's \"Momversations,\" a phenomenal blog that's been built up, where J&J basically is tapping into the power of mommy bloggers, allowing them to create a forum where they can communicate and connect. And it's also become a very valuable advertising revenue for J&J as well. This, plus the fact that you've got phenomenal work from CEOs, from Ford to Zappos, connecting on Twitter, creating an open environment, allowing their employees to be part of the process, rather than hidden behind walls.You see this rising force in total transparency and openness that companies are starting to adopt, all because the consumer is demanding it. So when we look at this and step back, what I believe is that the crisis that exists today is definitely real. It's been tremendously powerful for consumers. But at the same time, this is also a tremendous opportunity. The Chinese character for crisis is actually the same side of the same coin. Crisis equals opportunity. What we're seeing with consumers right now is the ability for them to actually lead us forward out of this recession.So we believe that values-driven spending will force capitalism to be better: it will drive innovation; it will make longer-lasting products; it will create better, more intuitive customer service; and it will give us the opportunity to connect with companies that share the values that we share. So when we look back and step out at this and see the beginning of these trends that we're seeing in our data, we see a very hopeful picture for the future of America.Thank you very much.(Applause)", "id": 661, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:12.846 --> 00:00:14.934\nThirteen trillion dollars in wealth\n\n00:00:14.958 --> 00:00:17.934\nhas evaporated over the course\nof the last two years.\n\n00:00:18.511 --> 00:00:20.808\nWe've questioned the future of capitalism.\n\n00:00:20.832 --> 00:00:23.184\nWe've questioned the financial industry.\n\n00:00:23.208 --> 00:00:25.184\nWe've looked at our government oversight.\n\n00:00:25.208 --> 00:00:26.902\nWe've questioned where we're going.\n\n00:00:26.926 --> 00:00:28.235\nAnd yet, at the same time,\n\n00:00:28.259 --> 00:00:31.135\nthis very well may be\na seminal moment in American history,\n\n00:00:31.159 --> 00:00:35.484\nan opportunity for the consumer\nto actually take control and guide us\n\n00:00:35.508 --> 00:00:37.684\nto a new trajectory in America.\n\n00:00:37.708 --> 00:00:39.433\nI'm calling this The Great Unwind.\n\n00:00:39.457 --> 00:00:40.459\n(Laughter)\n\n00:00:40.483 --> 00:00:43.084\nAnd the idea is a simple, simple idea,\n\n00:00:43.108 --> 00:00:47.188\nwhich is the fact that the consumer\nhas moved from a state of anxiety\n\n00:00:47.212 --> 00:00:48.370\nto action.\n\n00:00:48.394 --> 00:00:52.633\nConsumers who represent 72 percent\nof the GDP of America\n\n00:00:52.657 --> 00:00:56.101\nhave actually started, just like banks\nand just like businesses,\n\n00:00:56.125 --> 00:01:00.209\nto de-leverage, to unwind\ntheir leverage in daily life,\n\n00:01:00.233 --> 00:01:03.184\nto remove themselves\nfrom the liability and risk\n\n00:01:03.208 --> 00:01:06.084\nthat presents itself as they move forward.\n\n00:01:06.108 --> 00:01:08.841\nSo, to understand this --\nand I'm going to stress this --\n\n00:01:08.865 --> 00:01:11.028\nit's not about the consumer\nbeing in retreat.\n\n00:01:11.052 --> 00:01:12.412\nThe consumer is empowered.\n\n00:01:12.436 --> 00:01:15.693\nTo understand this, we'll step back\nand look at what's happened\n\n00:01:15.717 --> 00:01:17.612\nover the last year and a half.\n\n00:01:17.636 --> 00:01:19.855\nSo if you've been gone,\nthis is the CliffsNotes\n\n00:01:19.879 --> 00:01:21.503\non what's happened in the economy.\n\n00:01:21.527 --> 00:01:22.531\n(Laughter)\n\n00:01:22.555 --> 00:01:25.625\nUnemployment up.

--> 00:02:13.274\nDo you know why savings was so high?\n\n00:02:13.298 --> 00:02:16.608\nThere was nothing to buy,\nunless you wanted to buy some rivets.\n\n00:02:16.632 --> 00:02:19.562\nWhat happened, though,\nover the course of the last 20 years,\n\n00:02:19.586 --> 00:02:23.746\nwe went from a 10 percent savings rate\nto a negative savings rate.\n\n00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:25.423\nBecause we binged.\n\n00:02:25.447 --> 00:02:29.240\nWe bought extra-large cars,\nsupersized everything,\n\n00:02:29.264 --> 00:02:31.972\nwe bought remedies\nfor restless leg syndrome.\n\n00:02:31.996 --> 00:02:35.902\nAll these things together\nbasically created a factor\n\n00:02:35.926 --> 00:02:38.514\nwhere the consumer drove us\nheadlong into the crisis\n\n00:02:38.538 --> 00:02:39.811\nthat we face today.\n\n00:02:39.835 --> 00:02:46.112\nThe personal debt-to-income ratio\nbasically went from 65 to 135 percent\n\n00:02:46.136 --> 00:02:48.644\nin the span of about 15 years.\n\n00:02:48.668 --> 00:02:50.755\nSo consumers got over-leveraged.\n\n00:02:50.779 --> 00:02:53.960\nAnd of course our banks did as well,\nas did our federal government.\n\n00:02:53.984 --> 00:02:56.050\nThis is an absolutely staggering chart.\n\n00:02:56.074 --> 00:03:00.681\nIt shows leverage,\ntrended out from 1919 to 2009.\n\n00:03:00.705 --> 00:03:03.357\nAnd what you end up seeing\nis the whole phenomenon\n\n00:03:03.381 --> 00:03:07.237\nthat we are actually stepping forth\nand basically leveraging\n\n00:03:07.261 --> 00:03:10.440\nfuture education, future children\nin our households.\n\n00:03:10.464 --> 00:03:13.564\nSo if you look at this in the context\nof visualizing the bailout,\n\n00:03:13.588 --> 00:03:16.084\nwhat you can see is,\nif you stack up dollar bills,\n\n00:03:16.108 --> 00:03:18.350\nfirst of all, 360,000 dollars\n\n00:03:18.374 --> 00:03:20.893\nis about the size of a five-foot-four guy.\n\n00:03:20.917 --> 00:03:25.194\nBut if you stack it up, you see\nthis amazing, staggering amount of dollars\n\n00:03:25.218 --> 00:03:28.084\nthat have been put into the system\nto fund and bail us out.\n\n00:03:28.108 --> 00:03:30.273\nSo this is the first 315 billion.\n\n00:03:30.297 --> 00:03:32.070\nBut I read this fact the other day,\n\n00:03:32.094 --> 00:03:35.404\nthat one trillion seconds\nequals 32,000 years.\n\n00:03:35.428 --> 00:03:36.745\nSo if you think about that,\n\n00:03:36.769 --> 00:03:39.265\nthe context, the casualness\nwith which we talk about\n\n00:03:39.289 --> 00:03:41.542\ntrillion-dollar bailout here\nand trillion there,\n\n00:03:41.566 --> 00:03:44.951\nwe are stacking ourselves up\nfor long-term leverage.\n\n00:03:44.975 --> 00:03:47.627\nHowever, consumers have moved.\n\n00:03:47.651 --> 00:03:49.690\nThey are taking responsibility.\n\n00:03:49.714 --> 00:03:52.243\nWhat we're seeing\nis an uptake in the savings rate.\n\n00:03:52.267 --> 00:03:54.982\nIn fact, 11 straight months\nof savings have happened\n\n00:03:55.006 --> 00:03:56.653\nsince the beginning of the crisis.\n\n00:03:56.677 --> 00:03:59.041\nWe're working our way back up\nto that 10 percent.\n\n00:03:59.065 --> 00:04:00.995\nAlso, remarkably, in the fourth quarter,\n\n00:04:01.019 --> 00:04:04.400\nspending dropped\nto its lowest level in 62 years --\n\n00:04:04.424 --> 00:04:07.084\nalmost a 3.7 percent decline.\n\n00:04:07.108 --> 00:04:10.988\nVisa now reports that more people\nare using debit cards than credit cards.\n\n00:04:11.012 --> 00:04:14.405\nSo we're starting to pay for things\nwith money that we have.\n\n00:04:14.429 --> 00:04:18.084\nAnd we're starting to be much more careful\nabout how we save and invest.\n\n00:04:18.108 --> 00:04:20.084\nBut that's not really the whole story,\n\n00:04:20.108 --> 00:04:23.025\nbecause this has also been a dramatic\ntime of transformation.\n\n00:04:23.049 --> 00:04:25.675\nAnd you've got to admit,\nover the last year and a half,\n\n00:04:25.699 --> 00:04:27.767\nconsumers have been doing\nsome weird things.\n\n00:04:27.791 --> 00:04:30.082\nIt's pretty staggering,\nwhat we've lived through.\n\n00:04:30.106 --> 00:04:32.802\nIf you take into account\nthat 80 percent of all Americans\n\n00:04:32.826 --> 00:04:34.222\nwere born after World War II,\n\n00:04:34.246 --> 00:04:35.979\nthis was essentially our Depression.\n\n00:04:36.003 --> 00:04:38.808\nAnd so, as a result,\nsome crazy things have happened.\n\n00:04:38.832 --> 00:04:40.182\nI'll give you some examples.\n\n00:04:40.206 --> 00:04:44.871\nLet's talk about dentists, vasectomies,\nguns and shark attacks.\n\n00:04:44.895 --> 00:04:46.683\n(Laughter)\n\n00:04:46.707 --> 00:04:50.590\nDentists report molars --\npeople grinding their teeth,\n\n00:04:50.614 --> 00:04:52.977\ncoming in and reporting\nthat they've had stress.\n\n00:04:53.001 --> 00:04:56.423\nSo there's an increase in people\nhaving to have their fillings replaced.\n\n00:04:56.447 --> 00:04:59.741\nGun sales, according to the FBI,\nwho does background checks,\n\n00:04:59.765 --> 00:05:02.859\nare up almost 25 percent since January.\n\n00:05:02.883 --> 00:05:07.536\nVasectomies are up 48 percent,\naccording to the Cornell Institute.\n\n00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:09.964\nAnd lastly, but a very good point,\n\n00:05:09.988 --> 00:05:12.564\nhopefully not related\nto the former point I just made,\n\n00:05:12.588 --> 00:05:16.051\nwhich is that shark attacks\nare at their lowest level from 2003.\n\n00:05:16.075 --> 00:05:17.596\nDoes anybody know why?\n\n00:05:17.969 --> 00:05:19.151\n(Laughter)\n\n00:05:19.175 --> 00:05:20.343\nNo one's at the beach.\n\n00:05:20.367 --> 00:05:22.263\nSo there's a bright side to everything.\n\n00:05:22.287 --> 00:05:24.473\nBut seriously, what we see happening,\n\n00:05:24.497 --> 00:05:27.758\nand the reason I want to stress\nthat the consumer is not in retreat,\n\n00:05:27.782 --> 00:05:29.797\nis that this is a tremendous opportunity\n\n00:05:29.821 --> 00:05:32.415\nfor the consumer who drove us\ninto this recession\n\n00:05:32.439 --> 00:05:33.964\nto lead us right back out.\n\n00:05:33.988 --> 00:05:37.330\nWhat I mean by that is we can\nmove from mindless consumption\n\n00:05:37.354 --> 00:05:39.382\nto mindful consumption.\n\n00:05:39.406 --> 00:05:40.566\nRight?\n\n00:05:40.590 --> 00:05:41.665\n(Applause)\n\n00:05:41.689 --> 00:05:43.721\nIf you think about the last three decades,\n\n00:05:43.745 --> 00:05:47.027\nthe consumer has moved\nfrom savvy about marketing in the '90s,\n\n00:05:47.051 --> 00:05:51.028\nto gathering all these amazing social\nand search tools in this decade.\n\n00:05:51.052 --> 00:05:54.381\nBut the one thing holding them back\nis the ability to discriminate.\n\n00:05:54.405 --> 00:05:55.742\nBy restricting their demand,\n\n00:05:55.766 --> 00:05:59.084\nconsumers can actually align\ntheir values with their spending,\n\n00:05:59.108 --> 00:06:02.688\nand drive capitalism and business\nto not just be about more,\n\n00:06:02.712 --> 00:06:03.878\nbut to be about better.\n\n00:06:03.902 --> 00:06:05.879\nWe're going to explain that right now.\n\n00:06:05.903 --> 00:06:08.684\nBased on Y&amp;R's BrandAsset Valuator,\n\n00:06:08.708 --> 00:06:11.409\nproprietary tool of VML\nand Young &amp; Rubicam,\n\n00:06:11.433 --> 00:06:14.317\nwe set out to understand\nwhat's been happening in the crisis\n\n00:06:14.341 --> 00:06:15.882\nwith the consumer marketplace.\n\n00:06:15.906 --> 00:06:18.123\nWe found a couple\nof really interesting things.\n\n00:06:18.147 --> 00:06:20.574\nWe're going to go\nthrough four value shifts\n\n00:06:20.598 --> 00:06:22.934\nthat we see driving\nnew consumer behaviors,\n\n00:06:22.958 --> 00:06:25.015\nthat offer new management principles.\n\n00:06:25.039 --> 00:06:26.849\nThe first cultural value shift we see\n\n00:06:26.873 --> 00:06:29.499\nis this tendency toward something\nwe call \"liquid life.\"\n\n00:06:29.523 --> 00:06:30.673\nThis is the movement\n\n00:06:30.697 --> 00:06:33.778\nfrom Americans defining\ntheir success on having things\n\n00:06:33.802 --> 00:06:35.084\nto having liquidity,\n\n00:06:35.108 --> 00:06:37.800\nbecause the less excess\nthat you have around you,\n\n00:06:37.824 --> 00:06:39.976\nthe more nimble and fleet of foot you are.\n\n00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:42.470\nAs a result, d\u00e9class\u00e9 consumption is in.\n\n00:06:42.494 --> 00:06:46.429\nD\u00e9class\u00e9 consumption is the whole idea\nthat spending money frivolously\n\n00:06:46.453 --> 00:06:49.191\nmakes you look a little bit anti-fashion.\n\n00:06:49.215 --> 00:06:51.704\nThe management principle\nis dollars and cents.\n\n00:06:51.728 --> 00:06:54.572\nSo let's look at some examples\nof this d\u00e9class\u00e9 consumption\n\n00:06:54.596 --> 00:06:56.024\nthat falls out of this value.\n\n00:06:56.048 --> 00:06:58.345\nThe first thing is,\nsomething must be happening\n\n00:06:58.369 --> 00:07:00.445\nwhen P. Diddy vows to tone down his bling.\n\n00:07:00.469 --> 00:07:01.483\n(Laughter)\n\n00:07:01.507 --> 00:07:03.849\nBut seriously, we also have\nthis phenomenon\n\n00:07:03.873 --> 00:07:05.798\non Madison Avenue and in other places,\n\n00:07:05.822 --> 00:07:08.745\nwhere people are actually\nwalking out of luxury boutiques\n\n00:07:08.769 --> 00:07:12.582\nwith ordinary, generic paper bags\nto hide the brand purchases.\n\n00:07:12.606 --> 00:07:15.583\nWe see high-end haggling in fashion today,\n\n00:07:15.607 --> 00:07:18.084\nhigh-end haggling\nfor luxury and real estate.\n\n00:07:18.108 --> 00:07:20.480\nWe also see just a relaxing of ego,\n\n00:07:20.504 --> 00:07:22.756\nand sort of a dismantling of artifice.\n\n00:07:22.780 --> 00:07:26.627\nThis is a story on the yacht club\nthat's all basically blue collar.\n\n00:07:26.651 --> 00:07:28.825\nBlue-collar yacht club --\nwhere you can join,\n\n00:07:28.849 --> 00:07:32.084\nbut you've got to work in the boatyard\nas condition of membership.\n\n00:07:32.108 --> 00:07:36.769\nWe also see the trend toward tourism\nthat's a little bit more low-key:\n\n00:07:36.793 --> 00:07:39.920\nagritourism -- going to vineyards\nand going to farms.\n\n00:07:39.944 --> 00:07:43.569\nAnd then we also see this movement\nforward from dollars and cents.\n\n00:07:43.593 --> 00:07:46.308\nWhat businesses can do to connect\nwith these new mindsets\n\n00:07:46.332 --> 00:07:47.499\nis really interesting.\n\n00:07:47.523 --> 00:07:49.368\nA couple things that are kind of cool.\n\n00:07:49.392 --> 00:07:53.085\nOne is that Frito-Lay figured out\nthis liquidity thing with their consumer.\n\n00:07:53.109 --> 00:07:56.512\nThey found their consumer had more\nmoney at the beginning of the month,\n\n00:07:56.536 --> 00:07:57.945\nless at the end of the month.\n\n00:07:57.969 --> 00:07:59.982\nSo they started to change their packaging:\n\n00:08:00.006 --> 00:08:02.028\nlarger packs at the beginning\nof the month,\n\n00:08:02.052 --> 00:08:04.072\nsmaller packaging at the end of the month.\n\n00:08:04.096 --> 00:08:06.815\nReally interestingly, too,\nwas the San Francisco Giants.\n\n00:08:06.839 --> 00:08:09.084\nThey've just instituted dynamic pricing.\n\n00:08:09.108 --> 00:08:12.327\nIt takes into account everything\nfrom the pitcher match-ups,\n\n00:08:12.351 --> 00:08:14.194\nto the weather, to the team records,\n\n00:08:14.218 --> 00:08:16.622\nin setting prices for the consumer.\n\n00:08:16.646 --> 00:08:21.677\nAnother quick example of these types\nof movements is the rise of Zynga.\n\n00:08:21.701 --> 00:08:23.981\nZynga has risen on the consumer's desire\n\n00:08:24.005 --> 00:08:26.017\nto not want to be locked in to fixed cost.\n\n00:08:26.041 --> 00:08:28.801\nAgain, this theme is about variable\ncost, variable living.\n\n00:08:28.825 --> 00:08:30.697\nSo micro-payments have become huge.\n\n00:08:30.721 --> 00:08:33.300\nAnd lastly, some people are using Hulu\n\n00:08:33.324 --> 00:08:35.396\nas a device to get rid\nof their cable bill.\n\n00:08:35.420 --> 00:08:39.010\nSo, really clever ideas there\nthat are being taken ahold of\n\n00:08:39.034 --> 00:08:41.205\nand that marketers\nare starting to understand.\n\n00:08:41.229 --> 00:08:43.859\nThe second of the four values\nis this movement toward\n\n00:08:43.883 --> 00:08:45.188\nethics and fair play.\n\n00:08:45.212 --> 00:08:48.349\nWe see that play itself out\nwith empathy and respect.\n\n00:08:48.373 --> 00:08:49.994\nThe consumer is demanding it.\n\n00:08:50.018 --> 00:08:53.184\nAnd, as a result, businesses\nmust provide not only value,\n\n00:08:53.208 --> 00:08:54.360\nbut values.\n\n00:08:54.384 --> 00:08:57.557\nIncreasingly, consumers are looking\nat the culture of the company,\n\n00:08:57.581 --> 00:08:59.326\nat their conduct in the marketplace.\n\n00:08:59.350 --> 00:09:01.018\nSo we see with empathy and respect\n\n00:09:01.042 --> 00:09:03.838\nlots of really hopeful things\ncome out of this recession.\n\n00:09:03.862 --> 00:09:05.253\nI'll give you a few examples.\n\n00:09:05.277 --> 00:09:07.802\nOne is the rise toward communities\nand neighborhoods,\n\n00:09:07.826 --> 00:09:11.540\nand increased emphasis on your neighbors\nas your support system.\n\n00:09:11.564 --> 00:09:15.611\nAlso, a wonderful by-product\nof a really lousy thing,\n\n00:09:15.635 --> 00:09:17.003\nwhich has been unemployment,\n\n00:09:17.027 --> 00:09:19.828\nis a rise in volunteerism\nthat's been noted in our country.\n\n00:09:19.852 --> 00:09:23.522\nWe also see the phenomenon --\nsome of you may have \"boomerang kids\" --\n\n00:09:23.546 --> 00:09:25.183\nthese are \"boomerang alumni,\"\n\n00:09:25.207 --> 00:09:27.940\nwhere universities are actually\nreconnecting with alumni\n\n00:09:27.964 --> 00:09:30.745\nand helping them with jobs,\nsharing skills and retraining.\n\n00:09:30.769 --> 00:09:33.317\nWe also talked about character\nand professionalism.\n\n00:09:33.341 --> 00:09:37.084\nWe had this miracle on the Hudson\nin New York City in January,\n\n00:09:37.108 --> 00:09:41.084\nand suddenly Sully has become\na key name on BabyCenter.\n\n00:09:41.108 --> 00:09:42.178\n(Laughter)\n\n00:09:42.202 --> 00:09:44.598\nSo, from a value and values standpoint,\n\n00:09:44.622 --> 00:09:47.575\nwhat companies can do is connect\nin lots of different ways.\n\n00:09:47.599 --> 00:09:49.491\nMicrosoft is doing something wonderful.\n\n00:09:49.515 --> 00:09:53.353\nThey are actually vowing to retrain\ntwo million Americans with IT training,\n\n00:09:53.377 --> 00:09:56.479\nusing their existing infrastructure\nto do something good.\n\n00:09:56.503 --> 00:09:58.964\nAlso, a really interesting\ncompany is GORE-TEX.\n\n00:09:58.988 --> 00:10:01.698\nGORE-TEX is all about\npersonal accountability\n\n00:10:01.722 --> 00:10:03.671\nof their management and their employees,\n\n00:10:03.695 --> 00:10:07.253\nto the point where they really\nkind of shun the idea of bosses.\n\n00:10:07.277 --> 00:10:10.042\nBut they also talk about the fact\nthat their executives --\n\n00:10:10.066 --> 00:10:13.138\nall of their expense reports\nare put onto their company intranet\n\n00:10:13.162 --> 00:10:14.341\nfor everyone to see.\n\n00:10:14.365 --> 00:10:16.084\nComplete transparency.\n\n00:10:16.108 --> 00:10:18.384\nThink twice before you have\nthat bottle of wine.\n\n00:10:18.408 --> 00:10:19.465\n(Laughter)\n\n00:10:19.489 --> 00:10:22.262\nThe third of the four laws\nof post-crisis consumerism\n\n00:10:22.286 --> 00:10:23.771\nis about durable living.\n\n00:10:23.795 --> 00:10:26.332\nWe're seeing in our data\nthat consumers are realizing\n\n00:10:26.356 --> 00:10:28.084\nthis is a marathon, not a sprint.\n\n00:10:28.108 --> 00:10:30.967\nThey're digging in and looking\nfor ways to extract value\n\n00:10:30.991 --> 00:10:33.084\nout of every purchase they make.\n\n00:10:33.108 --> 00:10:36.023\nWitness the fact that Americans\nare holding on to their cars\n\n00:10:36.047 --> 00:10:39.909\nlonger than ever before:\n9.4 years on average, in March.\n\n00:10:39.933 --> 00:10:41.084\nA record.\n\n00:10:41.108 --> 00:10:45.084\nWe also see the fact that libraries\nhave become a huge resource for America.\n\n00:10:45.108 --> 00:10:48.950\nDid you know that 68 percent\nof Americans now carry a library card?\n\n00:10:48.974 --> 00:10:51.439\nThe highest percentage ever\nin our nation's history.\n\n00:10:51.463 --> 00:10:55.084\nSo what you see in this trend\nis also the accumulation of knowledge.\n\n00:10:55.108 --> 00:10:56.827\nContinuing education is up.\n\n00:10:56.851 --> 00:10:59.489\nEverything is focused\non betterment, training,\n\n00:10:59.513 --> 00:11:01.298\ndevelopment and moving forward.\n\n00:11:01.322 --> 00:11:03.859\nWe also see a big DIY movement.\n\n00:11:04.382 --> 00:11:08.546\nI was fascinated to learn that 30 percent\nof all homes in America\n\n00:11:08.570 --> 00:11:10.084\nare actually built by owners.\n\n00:11:10.108 --> 00:11:11.966\nThat includes cottages and the like,\n\n00:11:11.990 --> 00:11:13.158\nbut 30 percent.\n\n00:11:13.182 --> 00:11:16.194\nPeople are getting their hands dirty,\nrolling up their sleeves.\n\n00:11:16.218 --> 00:11:17.385\nThey want these skills.\n\n00:11:17.409 --> 00:11:20.973\nWe see it with the phenomenon of raising\nbackyard hens, chickens and ducks.\n\n00:11:20.997 --> 00:11:23.685\nAnd when you work out the math,\nthey say it doesn't work,\n\n00:11:23.709 --> 00:11:25.009\nbut the principle is there;\n\n00:11:25.033 --> 00:11:27.748\nit's about being sustainable\nand taking care of yourself.\n\n00:11:27.772 --> 00:11:30.383\nThen we look at the High Line\nin New York City,\n\n00:11:30.407 --> 00:11:33.175\nan excellent use of reimagining\nexisting infrastructure\n\n00:11:33.199 --> 00:11:34.358\nfor something good,\n\n00:11:34.382 --> 00:11:36.417\nwhich is a brand-new park\nin New York City.\n\n00:11:36.441 --> 00:11:40.532\nSo what brands can do, and companies,\nis pay dividends to consumers,\n\n00:11:40.556 --> 00:11:42.084\nbe a brand that lasts,\n\n00:11:42.108 --> 00:11:43.497\noffer transparency,\n\n00:11:43.521 --> 00:11:46.015\npromise you're going to be there\nbeyond today's sale.\n\n00:11:46.039 --> 00:11:48.084\nPerfect example of that is Patagonia.\n\n00:11:48.108 --> 00:11:49.822\nPatagonia's \"Footprint Chronicles\"\n\n00:11:49.846 --> 00:11:53.644\nbasically goes through and tracks\nevery product they make,\n\n00:11:53.668 --> 00:11:55.458\nand gives you social responsibility,\n\n00:11:55.482 --> 00:11:59.021\nand helps you understand the ethics\nbehind the product they make.\n\n00:11:59.045 --> 00:12:00.827\nAnother great example is Fidelity.\n\n00:12:00.851 --> 00:12:04.537\nRather than instant cash-back rewards\non your credit or debit purchases,\n\n00:12:04.561 --> 00:12:09.457\nthis is about 529 rewards\nfor your student education.\n\n00:12:09.481 --> 00:12:11.568\nOr the interesting company Sunrun.\n\n00:12:11.592 --> 00:12:12.747\nI love this company.\n\n00:12:12.771 --> 00:12:14.838\nThey've created a consumer collective\n\n00:12:14.862 --> 00:12:17.208\nwhere they put solar panels on households\n\n00:12:17.232 --> 00:12:19.327\nand create a consumer-based utility,\n\n00:12:19.351 --> 00:12:21.049\nwhere the electricity they generate\n\n00:12:21.073 --> 00:12:23.697\nis basically pumped back out\ninto the marketplace.\n\n00:12:23.721 --> 00:12:25.457\nSo it's a consumer-driven co-op.\n\n00:12:25.481 --> 00:12:29.155\nThe fourth post-crisis\nconsumerism that we see\n\n00:12:29.179 --> 00:12:31.496\nis this movement\nabout \"return to the fold.\"\n\n00:12:31.520 --> 00:12:33.319\nIt's incredibly important right now.\n\n00:12:33.343 --> 00:12:35.927\nTrust is not parceled out, as we all know.\n\n00:12:35.951 --> 00:12:38.143\nIt's now about connecting\nto your communities,\n\n00:12:38.167 --> 00:12:39.929\nconnecting to your social networks.\n\n00:12:39.953 --> 00:12:41.667\nIn my book, I talked about the fact\n\n00:12:41.691 --> 00:12:44.366\nthat 72 percent of people trust\nwhat other people say\n\n00:12:44.390 --> 00:12:45.841\nabout a brand or a company,\n\n00:12:45.865 --> 00:12:47.907\nversus 15 percent on advertising.\n\n00:12:47.931 --> 00:12:51.651\nSo in that respect, cooperative\nconsumerism has really taken off.\n\n00:12:51.675 --> 00:12:54.658\nThis is about consumers working\ntogether to get what they want\n\n00:12:54.682 --> 00:12:55.858\nout of the marketplace.\n\n00:12:55.882 --> 00:12:57.859\nLet's look at a couple of quick examples.\n\n00:12:57.883 --> 00:12:59.456\nThe artisanal movement is huge:\n\n00:12:59.480 --> 00:13:02.537\neverything about locally\nderived products and services,\n\n00:13:02.561 --> 00:13:04.345\nsupporting your local neighborhoods,\n\n00:13:04.369 --> 00:13:07.345\nwhether it's cheeses,\nwines and other products.\n\n00:13:07.369 --> 00:13:10.027\nAlso this rise of local currencies.\n\n00:13:10.051 --> 00:13:13.026\nRealizing that it's difficult\nto get loans in this environment,\n\n00:13:13.050 --> 00:13:15.109\nyou're doing business\nwith people you trust\n\n00:13:15.133 --> 00:13:16.312\nin your local markets.\n\n00:13:16.336 --> 00:13:20.204\nSo this rise of local currency\nis another really interesting phenomenon.\n\n00:13:20.228 --> 00:13:23.850\nAnd then they did a recent report\nI thought was fascinating.\n\n00:13:23.874 --> 00:13:27.047\nThey actually started, in certain\ncommunities in the United States,\n\n00:13:27.071 --> 00:13:29.098\nto publish people's electricity usage.\n\n00:13:29.122 --> 00:13:32.433\nAnd what they found out is when\nthat was available for public record,\n\n00:13:32.457 --> 00:13:35.527\nthe people's electricity usage\nin those communities dropped.\n\n00:13:36.469 --> 00:13:39.084\nThen we also look\nat the idea of cow-pooling,\n\n00:13:39.108 --> 00:13:43.303\nwhich is the whole phenomenon\nof consumers organizing together\n\n00:13:43.327 --> 00:13:47.220\nto buy meat from organic farms,\nthat they know is safe and controlled\n\n00:13:47.244 --> 00:13:49.430\nin the way that they want it\nto be controlled.\n\n00:13:49.454 --> 00:13:53.021\nAnd then there's this other really\ninteresting movement in California,\n\n00:13:53.045 --> 00:13:54.528\nwhich is about carrot mobs.\n\n00:13:54.552 --> 00:13:57.598\nThe traditional thing would be\nto boycott, right? Have a stick.\n\n00:13:57.622 --> 00:13:58.968\nWell, why not have a carrot?\n\n00:13:58.992 --> 00:14:02.296\nSo these are consumers organizing,\npooling their resources\n\n00:14:02.320 --> 00:14:05.084\nto incentify companies to do good.\n\n00:14:05.108 --> 00:14:07.905\nAnd then we look at what companies can do.\n\n00:14:07.929 --> 00:14:11.382\nThis is all the opportunity\nabout being a community organizer.\n\n00:14:11.406 --> 00:14:14.373\nYou have to realize\nthat you can't fight and control this.\n\n00:14:14.397 --> 00:14:16.007\nYou actually need to organize it.\n\n00:14:16.031 --> 00:14:18.556\nYou need to harness it.\nYou need to give it meaning.\n\n00:14:18.580 --> 00:14:21.792\nAnd there's lots of really\ninteresting examples here.\n\n00:14:21.816 --> 00:14:26.609\nFirst is just the rise of the fact\nthat Zagat's has actually moved out of\n\n00:14:26.633 --> 00:14:28.861\nand diversified from rating restaurants,\n\n00:14:28.885 --> 00:14:31.084\ninto actually rating health care.\n\n00:14:31.108 --> 00:14:33.237\nSo what credentials does Zagat's have?\n\n00:14:33.261 --> 00:14:34.431\nWell, they have a lot,\n\n00:14:34.455 --> 00:14:36.299\nbecause it's their network of people.\n\n00:14:36.323 --> 00:14:38.866\nSo that becomes\na very powerful force for them\n\n00:14:38.890 --> 00:14:41.084\nto make their brand more elastic.\n\n00:14:41.108 --> 00:14:43.365\nThen you look at the phenomenon of Kogi.\n\n00:14:43.894 --> 00:14:46.871\nThis Kogi doesn't exist.\nIt's a moving truck.\n\n00:14:46.895 --> 00:14:48.494\nIt's a moving truck through L.A.,\n\n00:14:48.518 --> 00:14:51.014\nand the only way you can find it\nis through Twitter.\n\n00:14:51.038 --> 00:14:52.095\n(Laughter)\n\n00:14:52.119 --> 00:14:53.272\nOr you look at\n\n00:14:53.296 --> 00:14:58.358\nJohnson &amp; Johnson's \"Momversations,\"\na phenomenal blog that's been built up,\n\n00:14:58.382 --> 00:15:02.512\nwhere J&amp;J basically is tapping\ninto the power of mommy bloggers,\n\n00:15:02.536 --> 00:15:06.984\nallowing them to create a forum\nwhere they can communicate and connect.\n\n00:15:07.008 --> 00:15:11.847\nAnd it's also become a very valuable\nadvertising revenue for J&amp;J as well.\n\n00:15:11.871 --> 00:15:16.085\nThis, plus the fact that you've got\nphenomenal work from CEOs,\n\n00:15:16.109 --> 00:15:18.649\nfrom Ford to Zappos,\nconnecting on Twitter,\n\n00:15:18.673 --> 00:15:20.084\ncreating an open environment,\n\n00:15:20.108 --> 00:15:23.146\nallowing their employees\nto be part of the process,\n\n00:15:23.170 --> 00:15:24.878\nrather than hidden behind walls.\n\n00:15:24.902 --> 00:15:29.107\nYou see this rising force\nin total transparency and openness\n\n00:15:29.131 --> 00:15:30.919\nthat companies are starting to adopt,\n\n00:15:30.943 --> 00:15:33.250\nall because the consumer is demanding it.\n\n00:15:33.274 --> 00:15:35.220\nSo when we look at this and step back,\n\n00:15:35.244 --> 00:15:39.436\nwhat I believe is that the crisis\nthat exists today is definitely real.\n\n00:15:39.460 --> 00:15:42.084\nIt's been tremendously\npowerful for consumers.\n\n00:15:42.108 --> 00:15:45.671\nBut at the same time,\nthis is also a tremendous opportunity.\n\n00:15:45.695 --> 00:15:49.162\nThe Chinese character for crisis\nis actually the same side\n\n00:15:49.186 --> 00:15:50.353\nof the same coin.\n\n00:15:50.377 --> 00:15:52.084\nCrisis equals opportunity.\n\n00:15:52.108 --> 00:15:55.602\nWhat we're seeing with consumers\nright now is the ability for them\n\n00:15:55.626 --> 00:15:58.262\nto actually lead us forward\nout of this recession.\n\n00:15:58.286 --> 00:16:03.084\nSo we believe that values-driven spending\nwill force capitalism to be better:\n\n00:16:03.108 --> 00:16:04.988\nit will drive innovation;\n\n00:16:05.012 --> 00:16:07.113\nit will make longer-lasting products;\n\n00:16:07.137 --> 00:16:09.733\nit will create better,\nmore intuitive customer service;\n\n00:16:09.757 --> 00:16:12.634\nand it will give us the opportunity\nto connect with companies\n\n00:16:12.658 --> 00:16:14.729\nthat share the values that we share.\n\n00:16:14.753 --> 00:16:16.772\nSo when we look back and step out at this\n\n00:16:16.796 --> 00:16:20.084\nand see the beginning of these trends\nthat we're seeing in our data,\n\n00:16:20.108 --> 00:16:22.957\nwe see a very hopeful picture\nfor the future of America.\n\n00:16:22.981 --> 00:16:24.149\nThank you very much.\n\n00:16:24.173 --> 00:16:25.989\n(Applause)"}, {"title": "Animating a photo-real digital face", "duration": "366", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/paul_debevec_animates_a_photo_real_digital_face", "transcript": "One of the biggest challenges in computer graphics has been being able to create a photo-real, digital human face. And one of the reasons it is so difficult is that, unlike aliens and dinosaurs, we look at human faces every day. They are very important to how we communicate with each other. As a result, we're tuned in to the subtlest things that could possibly be wrong with a computer rendering, in order to believe whether these things are realistic.And what I'm going to do in the next five minutes is take you through a process where we tried to create a reasonably photo-realistic computer-generated face, using some computer graphics technology we've developed, and also some collaborators at a company called Image Metrics. And we're going to try to do a photo-real face of an actress named Emily O'Brien, who is right there. And that's actually a completely computer-generated rendering of her face. By the end of the talk, we're going to see it move.The way that we did this is we tried to start with Emily herself, who was gracious enough to come to our laboratory in Marina Del Rey, and sit for a session in Light Stage 5. This is a face-scanning sphere, with 156 white LEDs all around that allow us to photograph her in a series of very controlled illumination conditions. And the lighting that we use these days looks something like this. We shoot all of these photographs in about three seconds.And we basically capture enough information with video projector patterns that drape over the contours of her face, and different principle directions of light from the light stage, to figure out both the coarse-scale and the fine-scale detail of her face. If we zoom in on this photograph right here, we can see it's a really nice photograph to have of her, because she is lit from absolutely everywhere at the same time to get a nice image of her facial texture.And in addition, we've actually used polarizers on all the lights \u2014 just like polarized sunglasses can block the glare off of the road, polarizers can block the shine off of the skin, so we don't get all those specular reflections to take this map. Now, if we turn the polarizers around just a little bit, we can actually bring that specular reflection of the skin back in, and you can see she looks kind of shiny and oily at this point. If you take the difference between these two images here, you can get an image lit from the entire sphere of light of just the shine off of Emily's skin.I don't think any photograph like this had ever been taken before we had done this. And this is very important light to capture, because this is the light that reflects off the first surface of the skin. It doesn't get underneath the translucent layers of the skin and blur out. And, as a result, it's a very good cue to the detailed shape of the skin-pore structure and all of the fine wrinkles that all of us have, the things that actually make us look like real humans.So, if we use information that comes off of this specular reflection, we can go from a traditional face scan that might have the gross contours of the face and the basic shape, and augment it with information that puts in all of that skin pore structure and fine wrinkles. And, even more importantly, since this is a photometric process that only takes three seconds to capture, we can shoot Emily in just part of an afternoon, in many different facial poses and facial expressions.So, here you can see her moving her eyes around, moving her mouth around. And these we're actually going to use to create a photo-real digital character. If you take a look at these scans that we have of Emily, you can see that the human face does an enormous amount of amazing things as it goes into different facial expressions. You can see things. Not only the face shape changes, but all sorts of different skin buckling and skin wrinkling occurs. You can see that the skin pore structure changes enormously from stretched skin pores to the regular skin texture. You can see the furrows in the brow and how the microstructure changes there. You can see muscles pulling down at flesh to bring her eyebrows down. Her muscles bulging in her forehead when she winces like that.In addition to this kind of high-resolution geometry, since it's all captured with cameras, we've got a great texture map to use for the face. And by looking at how the different color channels of the illumination, the red and the green and the blue, diffuse the light differently, we can come up with a way of shading the skin on the computer. Then, instead of looking like a plaster mannequin, it actually looks like it's made out of living human flesh.And this is what we used to give to the company Image Metrics to create a rigged, digital version of Emily. We're just seeing the coarse-scale geometry here. But they basically created a digital puppet of her, where you can pull on these various strings, and it actually moves her face in ways that are completely consistent with the scans that we took. And, in addition to the coarse-scale geometry, they also used all of that detail to create a set of what are called \"displacement maps\" that animate as well. These are the displacement maps here. And you can see those different wrinkles actually show up as she animates.So the next process was then to animate her. We actually used one of her own performances to provide the source data. So, by analyzing this video with computer vision techniques, they were able to drive the facial rig with the computer-generated performance. So what you're going to see now, after this, is a completely photo-real digital face. We can turn the volume up a little bit if that's available.Emily: Image Metrics is a markerless, performance-driven animation company. We specialize in high-quality facial animation for video games and films. Image Metrics is a markerless, performance-driven animation company. We specialize in high quality facial animation for video games and films.Paul Debevec: So, if we break that down into layers, here's that diffuse component we saw in the first slide. Here is the specular component animating. You can see all the wrinkles happening there. And there is the underlying wireframe mesh. And that is Emily herself.Now, where are we going with this here? We've gone a little bit beyond Light Stage 5. This is Light Stage 6, and we're looking at taking this technology and applying it to whole human bodies. This is Bruce Lawmen, one of our researchers in the group, who graciously agreed to get captured running in the Light Stage. And let's take a look at a computer-generated version of Bruce, running in a new environment. And thank you very much.

other.\n\n00:00:26.958 --> 00:00:29.958\nAs a result, we're tuned in to the subtlest things\n\n00:00:29.958 --> 00:00:31.958\nthat could possibly be wrong with a computer rendering,\n\n00:00:31.958 --> 00:00:34.958\nin order to believe whether these things are realistic.\n\n00:00:34.958 --> 00:00:36.958\nAnd what I'm going to do in the next five minutes\n\n00:00:36.958 --> 00:00:38.958\nis take you through a process\n\n00:00:38.958 --> 00:00:41.958\nwhere we tried to create a reasonably photo-realistic computer-generated face,\n\n00:00:41.958 --> 00:00:44.958\nusing some computer graphics technology we've developed,\n\n00:00:44.958 --> 00:00:46.958\nand also some collaborators at a company called Image Metrics.\n\n00:00:46.958 --> 00:00:48.958\nAnd we're going to try to do a photo-real face\n\n00:00:48.958 --> 00:00:51.958\nof an actress named Emily O'Brien, who is right there.\n\n00:00:51.958 --> 00:00:54.958\nAnd that's actually a completely computer-generated rendering of her face.\n\n00:00:54.958 --> 00:00:56.958\nBy the end of the talk, we're going to see it move.\n\n00:00:56.958 --> 00:00:59.958\nThe way that we did this is we tried to start with Emily herself,\n\n00:00:59.958 --> 00:01:02.958\nwho was gracious enough to come to our laboratory\n\n00:01:02.958 --> 00:01:05.958\nin Marina Del Rey, and sit for a session in Light Stage 5.\n\n00:01:05.958 --> 00:01:09.958\nThis is a face-scanning sphere, with 156 white LEDs all around\n\n00:01:09.958 --> 00:01:11.958\nthat allow us to photograph her\n\n00:01:11.958 --> 00:01:14.958\nin a series of very controlled illumination conditions.\n\n00:01:14.958 --> 00:01:17.958\nAnd the lighting that we use these days looks something like this.\n\n00:01:17.958 --> 00:01:19.958\nWe shoot all of these photographs in about three seconds.\n\n00:01:19.958 --> 00:01:22.958\nAnd we basically capture enough information\n\n00:01:22.958 --> 00:01:26.958\nwith video projector patterns that drape over the contours of her face,\n\n00:01:26.958 --> 00:01:28.958\nand different principle directions of light from the light stage,\n\n00:01:28.958 --> 00:01:30.958\nto figure out both the coarse-scale\n\n00:01:30.958 --> 00:01:32.958\nand the fine-scale detail of her face.\n\n00:01:32.958 --> 00:01:34.958\nIf we zoom in on this photograph right here,\n\n00:01:34.958 --> 00:01:36.958\nwe can see it's a really nice photograph to have of her,\n\n00:01:36.958 --> 00:01:40.958\nbecause she is lit from absolutely everywhere at the same time\n\n00:01:40.958 --> 00:01:42.958\nto get a nice image of her facial texture.\n\n00:01:42.958 --> 00:01:45.958\nAnd in addition, we've actually used polarizers on all the lights --\n\n00:01:45.958 --> 00:01:47.958\njust like polarized sunglasses can block\n\n00:01:47.958 --> 00:01:49.958\nthe glare off of the road,\n\n00:01:49.958 --> 00:01:51.958\npolarizers can block the shine off of the skin,\n\n00:01:51.958 --> 00:01:54.958\nso we don't get all those specular reflections to take this map.\n\n00:01:54.958 --> 00:01:56.958\nNow, if we turn the polarizers around just a little bit,\n\n00:01:56.958 --> 00:01:58.958\nwe can actually bring that specular reflection\n\n00:01:58.958 --> 00:02:00.958\nof the skin back in,\n\n00:02:00.958 --> 00:02:03.958\nand you can see she looks kind of shiny and oily at this point.\n\n00:02:03.958 --> 00:02:06.958\nIf you take the difference between these two images here,\n\n00:02:06.958 --> 00:02:08.958\nyou can get an image lit from the entire sphere of light\n\n00:02:08.958 --> 00:02:11.958\nof just the shine off of Emily's skin.\n\n00:02:11.958 --> 00:02:13.958\nI don't think any photograph like this had ever been taken\n\n00:02:13.958 --> 00:02:15.958\nbefore we had done this.\n\n00:02:15.958 --> 00:02:18.958\nAnd this is very important light to capture,\n\n00:02:18.958 --> 00:02:20.958\nbecause this is the light that reflects off the first surface of the skin.\n\n00:02:20.958 --> 00:02:22.958\nIt doesn't get underneath the translucent\n\n00:02:22.958 --> 00:02:24.958\nlayers of the skin and blur out.\n\n00:02:24.958 --> 00:02:26.958\nAnd, as a result, it's a very good cue\n\n00:02:26.958 --> 00:02:29.958\nto the detailed shape of the skin-pore structure\n\n00:02:29.958 --> 00:02:31.958\nand all of the fine wrinkles that all of us have,\n\n00:02:31.958 --> 00:02:33.958\nthe things that actually make us look like real humans.\n\n00:02:33.958 --> 00:02:37.958\nSo, if we use information that comes off of this specular reflection,\n\n00:02:37.958 --> 00:02:39.958\nwe can go from a traditional face scan\n\n00:02:39.958 --> 00:02:43.958\nthat might have the gross contours of the face and the basic shape,\n\n00:02:43.958 --> 00:02:45.958\nand augment it with information\n\n00:02:45.958 --> 00:02:48.958\nthat puts in all of that skin pore structure and fine wrinkles.\n\n00:02:48.958 --> 00:02:50.958\nAnd, even more importantly,\n\n00:02:50.958 --> 00:02:53.958\nsince this is a photometric process that only takes three seconds to capture,\n\n00:02:53.958 --> 00:02:55.958\nwe can shoot Emily\n\n00:02:55.958 --> 00:02:57.958\nin just part of an afternoon,\n\n00:02:57.958 --> 00:03:00.958\nin many different facial poses and facial expressions.\n\n00:03:00.958 --> 00:03:03.958\nSo, here you can see her moving her eyes around, moving her mouth around.\n\n00:03:03.958 --> 00:03:06.958\nAnd these we're actually going to use to create a photo-real digital character.\n\n00:03:06.958 --> 00:03:10.958\nIf you take a look at these scans that we have of Emily,\n\n00:03:10.958 --> 00:03:13.958\nyou can see that the human face does an enormous amount of amazing things\n\n00:03:13.958 --> 00:03:16.958\nas it goes into different facial expressions.\n\n00:03:16.958 --> 00:03:19.958\nYou can see things. Not only the face shape changes,\n\n00:03:19.958 --> 00:03:23.958\nbut all sorts of different skin buckling and skin wrinkling occurs.\n\n00:03:23.958 --> 00:03:27.958\nYou can see that the skin pore structure changes enormously\n\n00:03:27.958 --> 00:03:29.958\nfrom stretched skin pores\n\n00:03:29.958 --> 00:03:31.958\nto the regular skin texture.\n\n00:03:31.958 --> 00:03:34.958\nYou can see the furrows in the brow and how the microstructure changes there.\n\n00:03:34.958 --> 00:03:38.958\nYou can see muscles pulling down at flesh to bring her eyebrows down.\n\n00:03:38.958 --> 00:03:41.958\nHer muscles bulging in her forehead when she winces like that.\n\n00:03:41.958 --> 00:03:44.958\nIn addition to this kind of high-resolution geometry,\n\n00:03:44.958 --> 00:03:48.958\nsince it's all captured with cameras, we've got a great texture map to use for the face.\n\n00:03:48.958 --> 00:03:50.958\nAnd by looking at how the different color channels of the illumination,\n\n00:03:50.958 --> 00:03:52.958\nthe red and the green and the blue,\n\n00:03:52.958 --> 00:03:54.958\ndiffuse the light differently,\n\n00:03:54.958 --> 00:03:57.958\nwe can come up with a way of shading the skin on the computer.\n\n00:03:57.958 --> 00:04:00.958\nThen, instead of looking like a plaster mannequin,\n\n00:04:00.958 --> 00:04:03.958\nit actually looks like it's made out of living human flesh.\n\n00:04:03.958 --> 00:04:05.958\nAnd this is what we used\n\n00:04:05.958 --> 00:04:07.958\nto give to the company Image Metrics\n\n00:04:07.958 --> 00:04:10.958\nto create a rigged, digital version of Emily.\n\n00:04:10.958 --> 00:04:12.958\nWe're just seeing the coarse-scale geometry here.\n\n00:04:12.958 --> 00:04:15.958\nBut they basically created a digital puppet of her,\n\n00:04:15.958 --> 00:04:17.958\nwhere you can pull on these various strings,\n\n00:04:17.958 --> 00:04:19.958\nand it actually moves her face in ways that are\n\n00:04:19.958 --> 00:04:21.958\ncompletely consistent with the scans that we took.\n\n00:04:21.958 --> 00:04:23.958\nAnd, in addition to the coarse-scale geometry,\n\n00:04:23.958 --> 00:04:25.958\nthey also used all of that detail\n\n00:04:25.958 --> 00:04:28.958\nto create a set of what are called \"displacement maps\"\n\n00:04:28.958 --> 00:04:31.958\nthat animate as well.\n\n00:04:31.958 --> 00:04:33.958\nThese are the displacement maps here.\n\n00:04:33.958 --> 00:04:36.958\nAnd you can see those different wrinkles actually show up as she animates.\n\n00:04:36.958 --> 00:04:38.958\nSo the next process was then to animate her.\n\n00:04:38.958 --> 00:04:42.958\nWe actually used one of her own performances to provide the source data.\n\n00:04:42.958 --> 00:04:45.958\nSo, by analyzing this video with computer vision techniques,\n\n00:04:45.958 --> 00:04:47.958\nthey were able to drive the facial rig\n\n00:04:47.958 --> 00:04:49.958\nwith the computer-generated performance.\n\n00:04:49.958 --> 00:04:51.958\nSo what you're going to see now, after this,\n\n00:04:51.958 --> 00:04:53.958\nis a completely photo-real digital face.\n\n00:04:53.958 --> 00:04:55.958\nWe can turn the volume up a little bit if that's available.\n\n00:04:55.958 --> 00:04:59.958\nEmily: Image Metrics is a markerless, performance-driven animation company.\n\n00:04:59.958 --> 00:05:02.958\nWe specialize in high-quality facial animation\n\n00:05:02.958 --> 00:05:04.958\nfor video games and films.\n\n00:05:04.958 --> 00:05:08.958\nImage Metrics is a markerless, performance-driven animation company.\n\n00:05:08.958 --> 00:05:11.958\nWe specialize in high quality facial animation\n\n00:05:11.958 --> 00:05:14.958\nfor video games and films.\n\n00:05:14.958 --> 00:05:16.958\nPaul Debevec: So, if we break that down into layers, here's that diffuse component\n\n00:05:16.958 --> 00:05:18.958\nwe saw in the first slide.\n\n00:05:18.958 --> 00:05:20.958\nHere is the specular component animating.\n\n00:05:20.958 --> 00:05:22.958\nYou can see all the wrinkles happening there.\n\n00:05:22.958 --> 00:05:27.958\nAnd there is the underlying wireframe mesh.\n\n00:05:27.958 --> 00:05:29.958\nAnd that is Emily herself.\n\n00:05:29.958 --> 00:05:31.958\nNow, where are we going with this here?\n\n00:05:31.958 --> 00:05:35.958\nWe've gone a little bit beyond Light Stage 5. This is Light Stage 6,\n\n00:05:35.958 --> 00:05:37.958\nand we're looking at taking this technology\n\n00:05:37.958 --> 00:05:39.958\nand applying it to whole human bodies.\n\n00:05:39.958 --> 00:05:41.958\nThis is Bruce Lawmen, one of our researchers in the group,\n\n00:05:41.958 --> 00:05:44.958\nwho graciously agreed to get captured running in the Light Stage.\n\n00:05:44.958 --> 00:05:46.958\nAnd let's take a look at a computer-generated version\n\n00:05:46.958 --> 00:05:48.958\nof Bruce, running in a new environment.\n\n00:05:54.958 --> 00:05:56.958\nAnd thank you very much.\n\n00:05:56.958 --> 00:05:57.958\n(Applause)"}, {"title": "Lead like the great conductors", "duration": "1251", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/itay_talgam_lead_like_the_great_conductors", "transcript": "The magical moment, the magical moment of conducting. Which is, you go onto a stage. There is an orchestra sitting. They are all, you know, warming up and doing stuff. And I go on the podium. You know, this little office of the conductor. Or rather a cubicle, an open-space cubicle, with a lot of space. And in front of all that noise, you do a very small gesture. Something like this, not very pomp, not very sophisticated, this. And suddenly, out of the chaos, order. Noise becomes music.And this is fantastic. And it's so tempting to think that it's all about me. (Laughter) All those great people here, virtuosos, they make noise, they need me to do that. Not really. If it were that, I would just save you the talk, and teach you the gesture. So you could go out to the world and do this thing in whatever company or whatever you want, and you have perfect harmony. It doesn't work. Let's look at the first video. I hope you'll think it's a good example of harmony. And then speak a little bit about how it comes about.(Music)Was that nice? So that was a sort of a success. Now, who should we thank for the success? I mean, obviously the orchestra musicians playing beautifully, the Vienna Philharmonic Orchestra. They don't often even look at the conductor. Then you have the clapping audience, yeah, actually taking part in doing the music. You know Viennese audiences usually don't interfere with the music. This is the closest to an Oriental bellydancing feast that you will ever get in Vienna. (Laughter)Unlike, for example Israel, where audiences cough all the time. You know, Arthur Rubinstein, the pianist, used to say that, \"Anywhere in the world, people that have the flu, they go to the doctor. In Tel Aviv they come to my concerts.\" (Laughter) So that's a sort of a tradition. But Viennese audiences do not do that. Here they go out of their regular, just to be part of that, to become part of the orchestra, and that's great. You know, audiences like you, yeah, make the event.But what about the conductor? What can you say the conductor was doing, actually? Um, he was happy. And I often show this to senior management. People get annoyed. \"You come to work. How come you're so happy?\" Something must be wrong there, yeah? But he's spreading happiness. And I think the happiness, the important thing is this happiness does not come from only his own story and his joy of the music. The joy is about enabling other people's stories to be heard at the same time.You have the story of the orchestra as a professional body. You have the story of the audience as a community. Yeah. You have the stories of the individuals in the orchestra and in the audience. And then you have other stories, unseen. People who build this wonderful concert hall. People who made those Stradivarius, Amati, all those beautiful instruments. And all those stories are being heard at the same time. This is the true experience of a live concert. That's a reason to go out of home. Yeah? And not all conductors do just that. Let's see somebody else, a great conductor. Riccardo Muti, please.(Music)Yeah, that was very short, but you could see it's a completely different figure. Right? He's awesome. He's so commanding. Yeah? So clear. Maybe a little bit over-clear. Can we have a little demonstration? Would you be my orchestra for a second? Can you sing, please, the first note of Don Giovanni? You have to sing \"Aaaaaah,\" and I'll stop you. Okay? Ready?Audience: \u266b Aaaaaaah ... \u266bItay Talgam: Come on, with me. If you do it without me I feel even more redundant than I already feel. So please, wait for the conductor. Now look at me. \"Aaaaaah,\" and I stop you. Let's go.Audience: \u266b ... Aaaaaaaah ... \u266b (Laughter)Itay Talgam: So we'll have a little chat later. (Laughter) But ... There is a vacancy for a ... But \u2014 (Laughter) \u2014 you could see that you could stop an orchestra with a finger. Now what does Riccardo Muti do? He does something like this ... (Laughter) And then \u2014 sort of \u2014 (Laughter) So not only the instruction is clear, but also the sanction, what will happen if you don't do what I tell you. (Laughter) So, does it work? Yes, it works \u2014 to a certain point.When Muti is asked, \"Why do you conduct like this?\" He says, \"I'm responsible.\" Responsible in front of him. No he doesn't really mean Him. He means Mozart, which is \u2014 (Laughter) \u2014 like a third seat from the center. (Laughter) So he says, \"If I'm \u2014 (Applause) if I'm responsible for Mozart, this is going to be the only story to be told. It's Mozart as I, Riccardo Muti, understand it.\"And you know what happened to Muti? Three years ago he got a letter signed by all 700 employees of La Scala, musical employees, I mean the musicians, saying, \"You're a great conductor. We don't want to work with you. Please resign.\" (Laughter) \"Why? Because you don't let us develop. You're using us as instruments, not as partners. And our joy of music, etc., etc. ...\" So he had to resign. Isn't that nice? (Laughter) He's a nice guy. He's a really nice guy. Well, can you do it with less control, or with a different kind of control? Let's look at the next conductor, Richard Strauss.(Music)I'm afraid you'll get the feeling that I really picked on him because he's old. It's not true. When he was a young man of about 30, he wrote what he called \"The Ten Commandments for Conductors.\" The first one was: If you sweat by the end of the concert it means that you must have done something wrong. That's the first one. The fourth one you'll like better. It says: Never look at the trombones \u2014 it only encourages them. (Laughter)So, the whole idea is really to let it happen by itself. Do not interfere. But how does it happen? Did you see him turning pages in the score? Now, either he is senile, and doesn't remember his own music, because he wrote the music. Or he is actually transferring a very strong message to them, saying, \"Come on guys. You have to play by the book. So it's not about my story. It's not about your story. It's only the execution of the written music, no interpretation.\" Interpretation is the real story of the performer. So, no, he doesn't want that. That's a different kind of control. Let's see another super-conductor, a German super-conductor. Herbert von Karajan, please.(Music)What's different? Did you see the eyes? Closed. Did you see the hands? Did you see this kind of movement? Let me conduct you. Twice. Once like a Muti, and you'll \u2014 (Claps) \u2014 clap, just once. And then like Karajan. Let's see what happens. Okay? Like Muti. You ready? Because Muti ... (Laughter) Okay? Ready? Let's do it.Audience: (Claps)Itay Talgam: Hmm ... again.Audience: (Claps) Itay Talgam: Good. Now like a Karajan. Since you're already trained, let me concentrate, close my eyes. Come, come.Audience: (Claps) (Laughter)Itay Talgam: Why not together? (Laughter) Because you didn't know when to play. Now I can tell you, even the Berlin Philharmonic doesn't know when to play. (Laughter) But I'll tell you how they do it. No cynicism. This is a German orchestra, yes? They look at Karajan. And then they look at each other. (Laughter) \"Do you understand what this guy wants?\" And after doing that, they really look at each other, and the first players of the orchestra lead the whole ensemble in playing together.And when Karajan is asked about it he actually says, \"Yes, the worst damage I can do to my orchestra is to give them a clear instruction. Because that would prevent the ensemble, the listening to each other that is needed for an orchestra.\" Now that's great. What about the eyes? Why are the eyes closed? There is a wonderful story about Karajan conducting in London. And he cues in a flute player like this. The guy has no idea what to do. (Laughter) \"Maestro, with all due respect, when should I start?\" What do you think Karajan's reply was? When should I start? Oh yeah. He says, \"You start when you can't stand it anymore.\" (Laughter)Meaning that you know you have no authority to change anything. It's my music. The real music is only in Karajan's head. And you have to guess my mind. So you are under tremendous pressure because I don't give you instruction, and yet, you have to guess my mind. So it's a different kind of, a very spiritual but yet very firm control. Can we do it in another way? Of course we can. Let's go back to the first conductor we've seen: Carlos Kleiber, his name. Next video, please.(Music)(Laughter) Yeah. Well, it is different. But isn't that controlling in the same way? No, it's not, because he is not telling them what to do. When he does this, it's not, \"Take your Stradivarius and like Jimi Hendrix, smash it on the floor.\" It's not that. He says, \"This is the gesture of the music. I'm opening a space for you to put in another layer of interpretation.\" That is another story.But how does it really work together if it doesn't give them instructions? It's like being on a rollercoaster. Yeah? You're not really given any instructions, but the forces of the process itself keep you in place. That's what he does. The interesting thing is of course the rollercoaster does not really exist. It's not a physical thing. It's in the players' heads.And that's what makes them into partners. You have the plan in your head. You know what to do, even though Kleiber is not conducting you. But here and there and that. You know what to do. And you become a partner building the rollercoaster, yeah, with sound, as you actually take the ride. This is very exciting for those players. They do need to go to a sanatorium for two weeks, later. (Laughter) It is very tiring. Yeah? But it's the best music making, like this.But of course it's not only about motivation and giving them a lot of physical energy. You also have to be very professional. And look again at this Kleiber. Can we have the next video, quickly? You'll see what happens when there is a mistake.(Music) Again you see the beautiful body language. (Music) And now there is a trumpet player who does something not exactly the way it should be done. Go along with the video. Look. See, second time for the same player. (Laughter) And now the third time for the same player. (Laughter) \"Wait for me after the concert. I have a short notice to give you.\" You know, when it's needed, the authority is there. It's very important. But authority is not enough to make people your partners.Let's see the next video, please. See what happens here. You might be surprised having seen Kleiber as such a hyperactive guy. He's conducting Mozart. (Music) The whole orchestra is playing. (Music) Now something else. (Music) See? He is there 100 percent, but not commanding, not telling what to do. Rather enjoying what the soloist is doing. (Music)Another solo now. See what you can pick up from this. (Music) Look at the eyes. Okay. You see that? First of all, it's a kind of a compliment we all like to get. It's not feedback. It's an \"Mmmm ...\" Yeah, it comes from here. So that's a good thing. And the second thing is it's about actually being in control, but in a very special way. When Kleiber does \u2014 did you see the eyes, going from here? (Singing) You know what happens? Gravitation is no more.Kleiber not only creates a process, but also creates the conditions in the world in which this process takes place. So again, the oboe player is completely autonomous and therefore happy and proud of his work, and creative and all of that. And the level in which Kleiber is in control is in a different level. So control is no longer a zero-sum game. You have this control. You have this control. And all you put together, in partnership, brings about the best music. So Kleiber is about process. Kleiber is about conditions in the world.But you need to have process and content to create the meaning. Lenny Bernstein, my own personal maestro. Since he was a great teacher, Lenny Bernstein always started from the meaning. Look at this, please.(Music)Do you remember the face of Muti, at the beginning? Well he had a wonderful expression, but only one. (Laughter) Did you see Lenny's face? You know why? Because the meaning of the music is pain. And you're playing a painful sound. And you look at Lenny and he's suffering. But not in a way that you want to stop. It's suffering, like, enjoying himself in a Jewish way, as they say. (Laughter) But you can see the music on his face. You can see the baton left his hand. No more baton. Now it's about you, the player, telling the story. Now it's a reversed thing. You're telling the story. And you're telling the story. And even briefly, you become the storyteller to which the community, the whole community, listens to. And Bernstein enables that. Isn't that wonderful?Now, if you are doing all the things we talked about, together, and maybe some others, you can get to this wonderful point of doing without doing. And for the last video, I think this is simply the best title. My friend Peter says, \"If you love something, give it away.\" So, please.(Music)(Applause)", "id": 663, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:12.958 --> 00:00:16.958\nThe magical moment, the magical moment of conducting.\n\n00:00:16.958 --> 00:00:18.958\nWhich is, you go onto a stage. There is an orchestra sitting.\n\n00:00:18.958 --> 00:00:22.958\nThey are all, you know, warming up and doing stuff.\n\n00:00:22.958 --> 00:00:24.958\nAnd I go on the podium.\n\n00:00:24.958 --> 00:00:27.958\nYou know, this little office of the conductor.\n\n00:00:27.958 --> 00:00:30.958\nOr rather a cubicle, an open-space cubicle,\n\n00:00:30.958 --> 00:00:32.958\nwith a lot of space.\n\n00:00:32.958 --> 00:00:34.958\nAnd in front of all that noise,\n\n00:00:34.958 --> 00:00:36.958\nyou do a very small gesture.\n\n00:00:36.958 --> 00:00:40.958\nSomething like this, not very pomp, not very sophisticated, this.\n\n00:00:40.958 --> 00:00:43.958\nAnd suddenly, out of the chaos, order.\n\n00:00:43.958 --> 00:00:45.958\nNoise becomes music.\n\n00:00:45.958 --> 00:00:47.958\nAnd this is fantastic. And it's so tempting\n\n00:00:47.958 --> 00:00:49.958\nto think that it's all about me.\n\n00:00:49.958 --> 00:00:51.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:00:51.958 --> 00:00:53.958\nAll those great people here, virtuosos,\n\n00:00:53.958 --> 00:00:55.958\nthey make noise, they need me to do that.\n\n00:00:55.958 --> 00:00:57.958\nNot really. If it were that,\n\n00:00:57.958 --> 00:00:59.958\nI would just save you the talk,\n\n00:00:59.958 --> 00:01:01.958\nand teach you the gesture.\n\n00:01:01.958 --> 00:01:03.958\nSo you could go out to the world\n\n00:01:03.958 --> 00:01:06.958\nand do this thing in whatever company or whatever you want,\n\n00:01:06.958 --> 00:01:08.958\nand you have perfect harmony. It doesn't work.\n\n00:01:08.958 --> 00:01:10.958\nLet's look at the first video.\n\n00:01:10.958 --> 00:01:13.958\nI hope you'll think it's a good example of harmony.\n\n00:01:13.958 --> 00:01:17.958\nAnd then speak a little bit about how it comes about.\n\n00:01:17.958 --> 00:01:21.958\n(Music)\n\n00:02:13.958 --> 00:02:15.958\nWas that nice?\n\n00:02:15.958 --> 00:02:18.958\nSo that was a sort of a success.\n\n00:02:18.958 --> 00:02:21.958\nNow, who should we thank for the success?\n\n00:02:21.958 --> 00:02:23.958\nI mean, obviously the orchestra musicians\n\n00:02:23.958 --> 00:02:25.958\nplaying beautifully,\n\n00:02:25.958 --> 00:02:29.958\nthe Vienna Philharmonic Orchestra.\n\n00:02:29.958 --> 00:02:31.958\nThey don't often even look at the conductor.\n\n00:02:31.958 --> 00:02:34.958\nThen you have the clapping audience, yeah,\n\n00:02:34.958 --> 00:02:36.958\nactually taking part in doing the music.\n\n00:02:36.958 --> 00:02:40.958\nYou know Viennese audiences usually don't interfere with the music.\n\n00:02:40.958 --> 00:02:44.958\nThis is the closest to an Oriental bellydancing feast\n\n00:02:44.958 --> 00:02:46.958\nthat you will ever get in Vienna.\n\n00:02:46.958 --> 00:02:47.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:02:47.958 --> 00:02:50.958\nUnlike, for example Israel, where audiences cough all the time.\n\n00:02:50.958 --> 00:02:53.958\nYou know, Arthur Rubinstein, the pianist, used to say\n\n00:02:53.958 --> 00:02:56.958\nthat, \"Anywhere in the world, people that have the flu, they go to the doctor.\n\n00:02:56.958 --> 00:02:59.958\nIn Tel Aviv they come to my concerts.\"\n\n00:02:59.958 --> 00:03:00.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:03:00.958 --> 00:03:02.958\nSo that's a sort of a tradition.\n\n00:03:02.958 --> 00:03:04.958\nBut Viennese audiences do not do that.\n\n00:03:04.958 --> 00:03:09.958\nHere they go out of their regular, just to be part of that,\n\n00:03:09.958 --> 00:03:11.958\nto become part of the orchestra, and that's great.\n\n00:03:11.958 --> 00:03:13.958\nYou know, audiences like you, yeah,\n\n00:03:13.958 --> 00:03:16.958\nmake the event.\n\n00:03:16.958 --> 00:03:18.958\nBut what about the conductor? What can you say\n\n00:03:18.958 --> 00:03:22.958\nthe conductor was doing, actually?\n\n00:03:22.958 --> 00:03:25.958\nUm, he was happy.\n\n00:03:25.958 --> 00:03:28.958\nAnd I often show this to senior management.\n\n00:03:28.958 --> 00:03:30.958\nPeople get annoyed.\n\n00:03:30.958 --> 00:03:32.958\n\"You come to work. How come you're so happy?\"\n\n00:03:32.958 --> 00:03:35.958\nSomething must be wrong there, yeah? But he's spreading happiness.\n\n00:03:35.958 --> 00:03:37.958\nAnd I think the happiness, the important thing is this happiness\n\n00:03:37.958 --> 00:03:40.958\ndoes not come from\n\n00:03:40.958 --> 00:03:43.958\nonly his own story and his joy of the music.\n\n00:03:43.958 --> 00:03:47.958\nThe joy is about enabling other people's stories\n\n00:03:47.958 --> 00:03:49.958\nto be heard at the same time.\n\n00:03:49.958 --> 00:03:53.958\nYou have the story of the orchestra as a professional body.\n\n00:03:53.958 --> 00:03:56.958\nYou have the story of the audience as a community. Yeah.\n\n00:03:56.958 --> 00:03:58.958\nYou have the stories of the individuals\n\n00:03:58.958 --> 00:04:00.958\nin the orchestra and in the audience.\n\n00:04:00.958 --> 00:04:03.958\nAnd then you have other stories, unseen.\n\n00:04:03.958 --> 00:04:06.958\nPeople who build this wonderful concert hall.\n\n00:04:06.958 --> 00:04:11.958\nPeople who made those Stradivarius, Amati, all those beautiful instruments.\n\n00:04:11.958 --> 00:04:14.958\nAnd all those stories are being heard at the same time.\n\n00:04:14.958 --> 00:04:17.958\nThis is the true experience of a live concert.\n\n00:04:17.958 --> 00:04:19.958\nThat's a reason to go out of home. Yeah?\n\n00:04:19.958 --> 00:04:22.958\nAnd not all conductors do just that.\n\n00:04:22.958 --> 00:04:24.958\nLet's see somebody else, a great conductor.\n\n00:04:24.958 --> 00:04:26.958\nRiccardo Muti, please.\n\n00:04:27.958 --> 00:04:31.958\n(Music)\n\n00:05:03.958 --> 00:05:05.958\nYeah, that was very short, but you could see\n\n00:05:05.958 --> 00:05:07.958\nit's a completely different figure. Right?\n\n00:05:07.958 --> 00:05:09.958\nHe's awesome. He's so commanding. Yeah?\n\n00:05:09.958 --> 00:05:14.958\nSo clear. Maybe a little bit over-clear.\n\n00:05:14.958 --> 00:05:17.958\nCan we have a little demonstration? Would you be my orchestra for a second?\n\n00:05:17.958 --> 00:05:19.958\nCan you sing, please, the first note of Don Giovanni?\n\n00:05:19.958 --> 00:05:22.958\nYou have to sing \"Aaaaaah,\" and I'll stop you.\n\n00:05:22.958 --> 00:05:24.958\nOkay? Ready?\n\n00:05:24.958 --> 00:05:26.958\nAudience: \u266b Aaaaaaah ... \u266b\n\n00:05:26.958 --> 00:05:28.958\nItay Talgam: Come on, with me. If you do it without me\n\n00:05:28.958 --> 00:05:31.958\nI feel even more redundant than I already feel.\n\n00:05:31.958 --> 00:05:34.958\nSo please, wait for the conductor.\n\n00:05:34.958 --> 00:05:37.958\nNow look at me. \"Aaaaaah,\" and I stop you. Let's go.\n\n00:05:37.958 --> 00:05:41.958\nAudience: \u266b ... Aaaaaaaah ... \u266b\n\n00:05:41.958 --> 00:05:43.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:05:43.958 --> 00:05:45.958\nItay Talgam: So we'll have a little chat later.\n\n00:05:45.958 --> 00:05:46.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:05:46.958 --> 00:05:50.958\nBut ... There is a vacancy for a ...\n\n00:05:50.958 --> 00:05:54.958\nBut -- (Laughter)\n\n00:05:54.958 --> 00:05:57.958\n-- you could see that you could stop an orchestra with a finger.\n\n00:05:57.958 --> 00:05:59.958\nNow what does Riccardo Muti do? He does something like this ...\n\n00:06:02.958 --> 00:06:03.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:06:03.958 --> 00:06:06.958\nAnd then -- sort of -- (Laughter)\n\n00:06:06.958 --> 00:06:09.958\nSo not only the instruction is clear,\n\n00:06:09.958 --> 00:06:12.958\nbut also the sanction, what will happen if you don't do what I tell you.\n\n00:06:12.958 --> 00:06:15.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:06:15.958 --> 00:06:19.958\nSo, does it work? Yes, it works --\n\n00:06:19.958 --> 00:06:21.958\nto a certain point.\n\n00:06:21.958 --> 00:06:23.958\nWhen Muti is asked, \"Why do you conduct like this?\"\n\n00:06:23.958 --> 00:06:25.958\nHe says, \"I'm responsible.\"\n\n00:06:25.958 --> 00:06:27.958\nResponsible in front of him.\n\n00:06:27.958 --> 00:06:29.958\nNo he doesn't really mean Him. He means Mozart,\n\n00:06:29.958 --> 00:06:33.958\nwhich is -- (Laughter) -- like a third seat from the center.\n\n00:06:33.958 --> 00:06:34.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:06:34.958 --> 00:06:36.958\nSo he says, \"If I'm --\n\n00:06:36.958 --> 00:06:38.958\n(Applause)\n\n00:06:38.958 --> 00:06:40.958\nif I'm responsible for Mozart,\n\n00:06:40.958 --> 00:06:42.958\nthis is going to be the only story to be told.\n\n00:06:42.958 --> 00:06:46.958\nIt's Mozart as I, Riccardo Muti, understand it.\"\n\n00:06:46.958 --> 00:06:48.958\nAnd you know what happened to Muti?\n\n00:06:48.958 --> 00:06:50.958\nThree years ago he got a letter signed by\n\n00:06:50.958 --> 00:06:53.958\nall 700 employees of La Scala,\n\n00:06:53.958 --> 00:06:55.958\nmusical employees, I mean the musicians,\n\n00:06:55.958 --> 00:06:59.958\nsaying, \"You're a great conductor. We don't want to work with you. Please resign.\"\n\n00:06:59.958 --> 00:07:00.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:07:00.958 --> 00:07:03.958\n\"Why? Because you don't let us develop.\n\n00:07:03.958 --> 00:07:06.958\nYou're using us as instruments, not as partners.\n\n00:07:06.958 --> 00:07:08.958\nAnd our joy of music, etc., etc. ...\"\n\n00:07:08.958 --> 00:07:10.958\nSo he had to resign. Isn't that nice?\n\n00:07:10.958 --> 00:07:12.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:07:12.958 --> 00:07:15.958\nHe's a nice guy. He's a really nice guy.\n\n00:07:15.958 --> 00:07:18.958\nWell, can you do it with less control,\n\n00:07:18.958 --> 00:07:20.958\nor with a different kind of control?\n\n00:07:20.958 --> 00:07:24.958\nLet's look at the next conductor, Richard Strauss.\n\n00:07:26.958 --> 00:07:30.958\n(Music)\n\n00:07:54.958 --> 00:07:58.958\nI'm afraid you'll get the feeling that I really picked on him because he's old.\n\n00:07:58.958 --> 00:08:01.958\nIt's not true. When he was a young man\n\n00:08:01.958 --> 00:08:03.958\nof about 30, he wrote what he called\n\n00:08:03.958 --> 00:08:05.958\n\"The Ten Commandments for Conductors.\"\n\n00:08:05.958 --> 00:08:08.958\nThe first one was: If you sweat by the end of the concert\n\n00:08:08.958 --> 00:08:10.958\nit means that you must have done something wrong.\n\n00:08:10.958 --> 00:08:12.958\nThat's the first one. The fourth one you'll like better.\n\n00:08:12.958 --> 00:08:14.958\nIt says: Never look at the trombones --\n\n00:08:14.958 --> 00:08:16.958\nit only encourages them.\n\n00:08:16.958 --> 00:08:21.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:08:21.958 --> 00:08:23.958\nSo, the whole idea is really to let\n\n00:08:23.958 --> 00:08:25.958\nit happen by itself.\n\n00:08:25.958 --> 00:08:27.958\nDo not interfere.\n\n00:08:27.958 --> 00:08:30.958\nBut how does it happen? Did you see\n\n00:08:30.958 --> 00:08:32.958\nhim turning pages in the score?\n\n00:08:32.958 --> 00:08:34.958\nNow, either he is senile,\n\n00:08:34.958 --> 00:08:37.958\nand doesn't remember his own music, because he wrote the music.\n\n00:08:37.958 --> 00:08:40.958\nOr he is actually transferring a very strong message to them, saying,\n\n00:08:40.958 --> 00:08:44.958\n\"Come on guys. You have to play by the book.\n\n00:08:44.958 --> 00:08:46.958\nSo it's not about my story. It's not about your story.\n\n00:08:46.958 --> 00:08:49.958\nIt's only the execution of the written music,\n\n00:08:49.958 --> 00:08:51.958\nno interpretation.\"\n\n00:08:51.958 --> 00:08:54.958\nInterpretation is the real story of the performer.\n\n00:08:54.958 --> 00:08:57.958\nSo, no, he doesn't want that. That's a different kind of control.\n\n00:08:57.958 --> 00:09:00.958\nLet's see another super-conductor,\n\n00:09:00.958 --> 00:09:03.958\na German super-conductor. Herbert von Karajan, please.\n\n00:09:03.958 --> 00:09:07.958\n(Music)\n\n00:09:36.958 --> 00:09:39.958\nWhat's different? Did you see the eyes? Closed.\n\n00:09:39.958 --> 00:09:42.958\nDid you see the hands?\n\n00:09:42.958 --> 00:09:45.958\nDid you see this kind of movement? Let me conduct you. Twice.\n\n00:09:45.958 --> 00:09:47.958\nOnce like a Muti, and you'll -- (Claps) -- clap, just once.\n\n00:09:47.958 --> 00:09:49.958\nAnd then like Karajan. Let's see what happens. Okay?\n\n00:09:49.958 --> 00:09:52.958\nLike Muti. You ready? Because Muti ...\n\n00:09:52.958 --> 00:09:55.958\n(Laughter) Okay? Ready? Let's do it.\n\n00:09:55.958 --> 00:09:56.958\nAudience: (Claps)\n\n00:09:56.958 --> 00:09:58.958\nItay Talgam: Hmm ... again.\n\n00:09:58.958 --> 00:10:00.958\nAudience: (Claps)\n\n00:10:00.958 --> 00:10:02.958\nItay Talgam: Good. Now like a Karajan. Since you're already trained,\n\n00:10:02.958 --> 00:10:05.958\nlet me concentrate, close my eyes. Come, come.\n\n00:10:07.958 --> 00:10:09.958\nAudience: (Claps) (Laughter)\n\n00:10:09.958 --> 00:10:11.958\nItay Talgam: Why not together? (Laughter)\n\n00:10:11.958 --> 00:10:13.958\nBecause you didn't know when to play.\n\n00:10:13.958 --> 00:10:15.958\nNow I can tell you, even the Berlin Philharmonic\n\n00:10:15.958 --> 00:10:17.958\ndoesn't know when to play.\n\n00:10:17.958 --> 00:10:18.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:10:18.958 --> 00:10:20.958\nBut I'll tell you how they do it. No cynicism.\n\n00:10:20.958 --> 00:10:22.958\nThis is a German orchestra, yes?\n\n00:10:22.958 --> 00:10:26.958\nThey look at Karajan. And then they look at each other.\n\n00:10:26.958 --> 00:10:29.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:10:29.958 --> 00:10:32.958\n\"Do you understand what this guy wants?\"\n\n00:10:32.958 --> 00:10:34.958\nAnd after doing that,\n\n00:10:34.958 --> 00:10:36.958\nthey really look at each other, and the first players of the orchestra\n\n00:10:36.958 --> 00:10:39.958\nlead the whole ensemble in playing together.\n\n00:10:39.958 --> 00:10:41.958\nAnd when Karajan is asked about it\n\n00:10:41.958 --> 00:10:43.958\nhe actually says, \"Yes, the worst damage\n\n00:10:43.958 --> 00:10:45.958\nI can do to my orchestra\n\n00:10:45.958 --> 00:10:49.958\nis to give them a clear instruction.\n\n00:10:49.958 --> 00:10:51.958\nBecause that would\n\n00:10:51.958 --> 00:10:55.958\nprevent the ensemble, the listening to each other\n\n00:10:55.958 --> 00:10:57.958\nthat is needed for an orchestra.\"\n\n00:10:57.958 --> 00:10:59.958\nNow that's great. What about the eyes?\n\n00:10:59.958 --> 00:11:01.958\nWhy are the eyes closed?\n\n00:11:01.958 --> 00:11:05.958\nThere is a wonderful story about Karajan conducting in London.\n\n00:11:05.958 --> 00:11:08.958\nAnd he cues in a flute player like this.\n\n00:11:08.958 --> 00:11:11.958\nThe guy has no idea what to do. (Laughter)\n\n00:11:11.958 --> 00:11:14.958\n\"Maestro, with all due respect, when should I start?\"\n\n00:11:14.958 --> 00:11:17.958\nWhat do you think Karajan's reply was? When should I start?\n\n00:11:17.958 --> 00:11:21.958\nOh yeah. He says, \"You start when you can't stand it anymore.\"\n\n00:11:21.958 --> 00:11:24.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:11:24.958 --> 00:11:29.958\nMeaning that you know you have no authority to change anything.\n\n00:11:29.958 --> 00:11:33.958\nIt's my music. The real music is only in Karajan's head.\n\n00:11:33.958 --> 00:11:36.958\nAnd you have to guess my mind. So you are under tremendous pressure\n\n00:11:36.958 --> 00:11:38.958\nbecause I don't give you instruction,\n\n00:11:38.958 --> 00:11:40.958\nand yet, you have to guess my mind.\n\n00:11:40.958 --> 00:11:42.958\nSo it's a different kind of, a very spiritual but yet\n\n00:11:42.958 --> 00:11:45.958\nvery firm control.\n\n00:11:45.958 --> 00:11:47.958\nCan we do it in another way? Of course we can. Let's go back\n\n00:11:47.958 --> 00:11:49.958\nto the first conductor we've seen:\n\n00:11:49.958 --> 00:11:51.958\nCarlos Kleiber, his name. Next video, please.\n\n00:11:53.958 --> 00:11:57.958\n(Music)\n\n00:12:49.958 --> 00:12:51.958\n(Laughter) Yeah.\n\n00:12:51.958 --> 00:12:54.958\nWell, it is different. But isn't that controlling in the same way?\n\n00:12:54.958 --> 00:12:57.958\nNo, it's not, because he is not telling them what to do.\n\n00:12:57.958 --> 00:12:59.958\nWhen he does this, it's not,\n\n00:12:59.958 --> 00:13:02.958\n\"Take your Stradivarius and like Jimi Hendrix,\n\n00:13:02.958 --> 00:13:04.958\nsmash it on the floor.\" It's not that.\n\n00:13:04.958 --> 00:13:06.958\nHe says, \"This is the gesture of the music.\n\n00:13:06.958 --> 00:13:08.958\nI'm opening a space for you\n\n00:13:08.958 --> 00:13:10.958\nto put in another layer\n\n00:13:10.958 --> 00:13:12.958\nof interpretation.\"\n\n00:13:12.958 --> 00:13:14.958\nThat is another story.\n\n00:13:14.958 --> 00:13:16.958\nBut how does it really work together\n\n00:13:16.958 --> 00:13:18.958\nif it doesn't give them instructions?\n\n00:13:18.958 --> 00:13:20.958\nIt's like being on a rollercoaster. Yeah?\n\n00:13:20.958 --> 00:13:22.958\nYou're not really given any instructions,\n\n00:13:22.958 --> 00:13:26.958\nbut the forces of the process itself keep you in place.\n\n00:13:26.958 --> 00:13:28.958\nThat's what he does.\n\n00:13:28.958 --> 00:13:30.958\nThe interesting thing is of course the rollercoaster does not really exist.\n\n00:13:30.958 --> 00:13:34.958\nIt's not a physical thing. It's in the players' heads.\n\n00:13:34.958 --> 00:13:37.958\nAnd that's what makes them into partners.\n\n00:13:37.958 --> 00:13:39.958\nYou have the plan in your head.\n\n00:13:39.958 --> 00:13:42.958\nYou know what to do, even though Kleiber is not conducting you.\n\n00:13:42.958 --> 00:13:45.958\nBut here and there and that. You know what to do.\n\n00:13:45.958 --> 00:13:48.958\nAnd you become a partner building the rollercoaster,\n\n00:13:48.958 --> 00:13:50.958\nyeah, with sound,\n\n00:13:50.958 --> 00:13:52.958\nas you actually take the ride.\n\n00:13:52.958 --> 00:13:55.958\nThis is very exciting for those players.\n\n00:13:55.958 --> 00:13:57.958\nThey do need to go to a sanatorium for two weeks, later.\n\n00:13:57.958 --> 00:13:58.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:13:58.958 --> 00:14:00.958\nIt is very tiring. Yeah?\n\n00:14:00.958 --> 00:14:04.958\nBut it's the best music making, like this.\n\n00:14:04.958 --> 00:14:07.958\nBut of course it's not only about motivation\n\n00:14:07.958 --> 00:14:10.958\nand giving them a lot of physical energy.\n\n00:14:10.958 --> 00:14:12.958\nYou also have to be very professional.\n\n00:14:12.958 --> 00:14:14.958\nAnd look again at this Kleiber.\n\n00:14:14.958 --> 00:14:16.958\nCan we have the next video, quickly?\n\n00:14:16.958 --> 00:14:20.958\nYou'll see what happens when there is a mistake.\n\n00:14:20.958 --> 00:14:23.958\n(Music) Again you see the beautiful body language.\n\n00:14:23.958 --> 00:14:26.958\n(Music)\n\n00:14:29.958 --> 00:14:32.958\nAnd now there is a trumpet player who\n\n00:14:32.958 --> 00:14:34.958\ndoes something not exactly the way it should be done.\n\n00:14:34.958 --> 00:14:36.958\nGo along with the video. Look.\n\n00:14:39.958 --> 00:14:43.958\nSee, second time for the same player.\n\n00:14:45.958 --> 00:14:48.958\n(Laughter) And now the third time for the same player.\n\n00:14:52.958 --> 00:14:53.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:14:53.958 --> 00:14:55.958\n\"Wait for me after the concert.\n\n00:14:55.958 --> 00:14:57.958\nI have a short notice to give you.\"\n\n00:14:57.958 --> 00:15:01.958\nYou know, when it's needed, the authority is there. It's very important.\n\n00:15:01.958 --> 00:15:04.958\nBut authority is not enough to make people your partners.\n\n00:15:04.958 --> 00:15:06.958\nLet's see the next video, please. See what happens here.\n\n00:15:06.958 --> 00:15:08.958\nYou might be surprised having seen Kleiber\n\n00:15:08.958 --> 00:15:11.958\nas such a hyperactive guy.\n\n00:15:11.958 --> 00:15:13.958\nHe's conducting Mozart.\n\n00:15:13.958 --> 00:15:16.958\n(Music)\n\n00:15:16.958 --> 00:15:18.958\nThe whole orchestra is playing.\n\n00:15:18.958 --> 00:15:20.958\n(Music)\n\n00:15:20.958 --> 00:15:22.958\nNow something else.\n\n00:15:22.958 --> 00:15:25.958\n(Music)\n\n00:15:32.958 --> 00:15:36.958\nSee? He is there 100 percent,\n\n00:15:36.958 --> 00:15:38.958\nbut not commanding, not telling what to do.\n\n00:15:38.958 --> 00:15:41.958\nRather enjoying what the soloist is doing.\n\n00:15:41.958 --> 00:15:44.958\n(Music)\n\n00:15:44.958 --> 00:15:47.958\nAnother solo now. See what you can pick up from this.\n\n00:15:47.958 --> 00:15:50.958\n(Music)\n\n00:15:53.958 --> 00:15:55.958\nLook at the eyes.\n\n00:15:59.958 --> 00:16:01.958\nOkay. You see that?\n\n00:16:01.958 --> 00:16:04.958\nFirst of all, it's a kind of a compliment we all like to get.\n\n00:16:04.958 --> 00:16:07.958\nIt's not feedback. It's an \"Mmmm ...\" Yeah, it comes from here.\n\n00:16:07.958 --> 00:16:09.958\nSo that's a good thing.\n\n00:16:09.958 --> 00:16:11.958\nAnd the second thing is\n\n00:16:11.958 --> 00:16:13.958\nit's about actually being in control,\n\n00:16:13.958 --> 00:16:15.958\nbut in a very special way.\n\n00:16:15.958 --> 00:16:18.958\nWhen Kleiber does -- did you see the eyes,\n\n00:16:18.958 --> 00:16:20.958\ngoing from here? (Singing)\n\n00:16:20.958 --> 00:16:24.958\nYou know what happens? Gravitation is no more.\n\n00:16:24.958 --> 00:16:26.958\nKleiber not only creates a process,\n\n00:16:26.958 --> 00:16:29.958\nbut also creates the conditions in the world\n\n00:16:29.958 --> 00:16:32.958\nin which this process takes place.\n\n00:16:32.958 --> 00:16:34.958\nSo again, the oboe player\n\n00:16:34.958 --> 00:16:36.958\nis completely autonomous\n\n00:16:36.958 --> 00:16:39.958\nand therefore happy and proud of his work,\n\n00:16:39.958 --> 00:16:41.958\nand creative and all of that.\n\n00:16:41.958 --> 00:16:45.958\nAnd the level in which Kleiber is in control is in a different level.\n\n00:16:45.958 --> 00:16:48.958\nSo control is no longer a zero-sum game.\n\n00:16:48.958 --> 00:16:50.958\nYou have this control. You have this control. And all you put together,\n\n00:16:50.958 --> 00:16:54.958\nin partnership, brings about the best music.\n\n00:16:54.958 --> 00:16:56.958\nSo Kleiber is about process.\n\n00:16:56.958 --> 00:16:58.958\nKleiber is about conditions in the world.\n\n00:16:58.958 --> 00:17:02.958\nBut you need to have process and content to create the meaning.\n\n00:17:02.958 --> 00:17:04.958\nLenny Bernstein, my own personal maestro.\n\n00:17:04.958 --> 00:17:07.958\nSince he was a great teacher,\n\n00:17:07.958 --> 00:17:13.958\nLenny Bernstein always started from the meaning. Look at this, please.\n\n00:17:13.958 --> 00:17:17.958\n(Music)\n\n00:18:12.958 --> 00:18:14.958\nDo you remember the face of Muti, at the beginning?\n\n00:18:14.958 --> 00:18:17.958\nWell he had a wonderful expression, but only one.\n\n00:18:17.958 --> 00:18:18.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:18:18.958 --> 00:18:20.958\nDid you see Lenny's face?\n\n00:18:20.958 --> 00:18:24.958\nYou know why? Because the meaning of the music is pain.\n\n00:18:24.958 --> 00:18:26.958\nAnd you're playing a painful sound.\n\n00:18:26.958 --> 00:18:29.958\nAnd you look at Lenny and he's suffering.\n\n00:18:29.958 --> 00:18:31.958\nBut not in a way that you want to stop.\n\n00:18:31.958 --> 00:18:35.958\nIt's suffering, like, enjoying himself in a Jewish way, as they say.\n\n00:18:35.958 --> 00:18:39.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:18:39.958 --> 00:18:42.958\nBut you can see the music on his face.\n\n00:18:42.958 --> 00:18:45.958\nYou can see the baton left his hand. No more baton.\n\n00:18:45.958 --> 00:18:47.958\nNow it's about you, the player,\n\n00:18:47.958 --> 00:18:49.958\ntelling the story.\n\n00:18:49.958 --> 00:18:51.958\nNow it's a reversed thing. You're telling the story. And you're telling the story.\n\n00:18:51.958 --> 00:18:54.958\nAnd even briefly, you become the storyteller\n\n00:18:54.958 --> 00:18:57.958\nto which the community, the whole community, listens to.\n\n00:18:57.958 --> 00:19:01.958\nAnd Bernstein enables that. Isn't that wonderful?\n\n00:19:01.958 --> 00:19:05.958\nNow, if you are doing all the things we talked about, together,\n\n00:19:05.958 --> 00:19:07.958\nand maybe some others,\n\n00:19:07.958 --> 00:19:10.958\nyou can get to this wonderful point of doing without doing.\n\n00:19:10.958 --> 00:19:15.958\nAnd for the last video, I think this is simply the best title.\n\n00:19:15.958 --> 00:19:17.958\nMy friend Peter says,\n\n00:19:17.958 --> 00:19:21.958\n\"If you love something, give it away.\" So, please.\n\n00:19:21.958 --> 00:19:25.958\n(Music)\n\n00:20:25.958 --> 00:20:42.958\n(Applause)"}, {"title": "1.3m reasons to re-invent the syringe", "duration": "285", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/marc_koska_the_devastating_toll_of_syringe_reuse", "transcript": "Twenty-five-and-a-quarter years ago I read a newspaper article which said that one day syringes would be one of the major causes of the spread of AIDS, the transmission of AIDS. I thought this was unacceptable. So I decided to do something about it.Sadly, it's come true. Malaria, as we all know, kills approximately one million people a year. The reuse of syringes now exceeds that and kills 1.3 million people a year. This young girl and her friend that I met in an orphanage in Delhi were HIV positive from a syringe. And what was so sad about this particular story was that once their parents had found out \u2014 and don't forget, their parents took them to the doctor \u2014 the parents threw them out on the street. And hence they ended up in an orphanage.And it comes from situations like this where you have either skilled or unskilled practitioners, blindly giving an injection to someone. And the injection is so valuable, that the people basically trust the doctor, being second to God, which I've heard many times, to do the right thing. But in fact they're not. And you can understand, obviously, the transmission problem between people in high-virus areas.This video we took undercover, which shows you, over a half an hour period, a tray of medicines of 42 vials, which are being delivered with only 2 syringes in a public hospital in India. And over the course of half an hour, not one syringe was filmed being unwrapped. They started with two and they ended with two. And you'll see, just now, a nurse coming back to the tray, which is their sort of modular station, and dropping the syringe she's just used back in the tray for it to be picked up and used again. So you can imagine the scale of this problem. And in fact in India alone, 62 percent of all injections given are unsafe.These kids in Pakistan don't go to school. They are lucky. They already have a job. And that job is that they go around and pick up syringes from the back of hospitals, wash them, and in the course of this, obviously picking them up they injure themselves. And then they repackage them and sell them out on markets for literally more money than a sterile syringe in the first place, which is quite bizarre. In an interesting photo, their father, while we were talking to him, picked up a syringe and pricked his finger \u2014 I don't know whether you can see the drop of blood on the end \u2014 and immediately whipped out a box of matches, lit one, and burned the blood off the end of his finger, giving me full assurance that that was the way that you stopped the transmission of HIV.In China, recycling is a major issue. And they are collected en mass \u2014 you can see the scale of it here \u2014 and sorted out, by hand, back into the right sizes, and then put back out on the street. So recycling and reuse are the major issues here. But there was one interesting anecdote that I found in Indonesia. In all schools in Indonesia, there is usually a toy seller in the playground. The toy seller, in this case, had syringes, which they usually do, next door to the diggers, which is obviously what you would expect. And they use them, in the breaks, for water pistols. They squirt them at each other, which is lovely and innocent. And they are having great fun. But they also drink from them while they're in their breaks, because it's hot. And they squirt the water into their mouths. And these are used with traces of blood visible.So we need a better product. And we need better information. And I think, if I can just borrow this camera, I was going to show you my invention, which I came up with. So, it's a normal-looking syringe. You load it up in the normal way. This is made on existing equipment in 14 factories that we license. You give the injection and then put it down. If someone then tries to reuse it, it locks and breaks afterwards. It's very, very simple. Thank you. (Applause) And it costs the same as a normal syringe. And in comparison, a Coca-Cola is 10 times the price. And that will stop reusing a syringe 20 or 30 times.And I have an information charity which has done huge scale amount of work in India. And we're very proud of giving information to people, so that little kids like this don't do stupid things. Thank you very much.

Malaria, as we all know,\n\n00:00:29.958 --> 00:00:32.958\nkills approximately one million people a year.\n\n00:00:32.958 --> 00:00:34.958\nThe reuse of syringes now exceeds that\n\n00:00:34.958 --> 00:00:39.958\nand kills 1.3 million people a year.\n\n00:00:39.958 --> 00:00:41.958\nThis young girl and her friend\n\n00:00:41.958 --> 00:00:43.958\nthat I met in an orphanage in Delhi\n\n00:00:43.958 --> 00:00:48.958\nwere HIV positive from a syringe.\n\n00:00:48.958 --> 00:00:51.958\nAnd what was so sad about this particular story\n\n00:00:51.958 --> 00:00:54.958\nwas that once their parents had found out --\n\n00:00:54.958 --> 00:00:58.958\nand don't forget, their parents took them to the doctor --\n\n00:00:58.958 --> 00:01:00.958\nthe parents threw them out on the street.\n\n00:01:00.958 --> 00:01:03.958\nAnd hence they ended up in an orphanage.\n\n00:01:03.958 --> 00:01:05.958\nAnd it comes from situations like this where\n\n00:01:05.958 --> 00:01:08.958\nyou have either skilled or unskilled practitioners,\n\n00:01:08.958 --> 00:01:11.958\nblindly giving an injection to someone.\n\n00:01:11.958 --> 00:01:14.958\nAnd the injection is so valuable,\n\n00:01:14.958 --> 00:01:16.958\nthat the people basically trust\n\n00:01:16.958 --> 00:01:19.958\nthe doctor, being second to God, which I've heard many times,\n\n00:01:19.958 --> 00:01:22.958\nto do the right thing. But in fact they're not.\n\n00:01:22.958 --> 00:01:24.958\nAnd you can understand, obviously, the transmission problem\n\n00:01:24.958 --> 00:01:28.958\nbetween people in high-virus areas.\n\n00:01:28.958 --> 00:01:30.958\nThis video we took undercover,\n\n00:01:30.958 --> 00:01:32.958\nwhich shows you, over a half an hour period,\n\n00:01:32.958 --> 00:01:36.958\na tray of medicines of 42 vials,\n\n00:01:36.958 --> 00:01:41.958\nwhich are being delivered with only 2 syringes in a public hospital in India.\n\n00:01:41.958 --> 00:01:43.958\nAnd over the course of half an hour, not one syringe\n\n00:01:43.958 --> 00:01:45.958\nwas filmed being unwrapped.\n\n00:01:45.958 --> 00:01:48.958\nThey started with two and they ended with two.\n\n00:01:48.958 --> 00:01:51.958\nAnd you'll see, just now, a nurse coming back to the tray,\n\n00:01:51.958 --> 00:01:54.958\nwhich is their sort of modular station,\n\n00:01:54.958 --> 00:01:57.958\nand dropping the syringe she's just used\n\n00:01:57.958 --> 00:02:00.958\nback in the tray for it to be picked up and used again.\n\n00:02:00.958 --> 00:02:03.958\nSo you can imagine the scale of this problem.\n\n00:02:03.958 --> 00:02:05.958\nAnd in fact in India alone, 62 percent\n\n00:02:05.958 --> 00:02:07.958\nof all injections given\n\n00:02:07.958 --> 00:02:09.958\nare unsafe.\n\n00:02:09.958 --> 00:02:11.958\nThese kids in Pakistan don't go to school.\n\n00:02:11.958 --> 00:02:13.958\nThey are lucky. They already have a job.\n\n00:02:13.958 --> 00:02:15.958\nAnd that job is that they go around and pick up syringes\n\n00:02:15.958 --> 00:02:17.958\nfrom the back of hospitals,\n\n00:02:17.958 --> 00:02:19.958\nwash them, and in the course of this,\n\n00:02:19.958 --> 00:02:22.958\nobviously picking them up they injure themselves.\n\n00:02:22.958 --> 00:02:25.958\nAnd then they repackage them and sell them out on markets\n\n00:02:25.958 --> 00:02:27.958\nfor literally more money\n\n00:02:27.958 --> 00:02:30.958\nthan a sterile syringe in the first place, which is quite bizarre.\n\n00:02:30.958 --> 00:02:33.958\nIn an interesting photo, their father, while we were talking to him,\n\n00:02:33.958 --> 00:02:35.958\npicked up a syringe and pricked his finger --\n\n00:02:35.958 --> 00:02:38.958\nI don't know whether you can see the drop of blood on the end --\n\n00:02:38.958 --> 00:02:41.958\nand immediately whipped out a box of matches,\n\n00:02:41.958 --> 00:02:44.958\nlit one, and burned the blood off the end of his finger,\n\n00:02:44.958 --> 00:02:46.958\ngiving me full assurance\n\n00:02:46.958 --> 00:02:50.958\nthat that was the way that you stopped the transmission of HIV.\n\n00:02:50.958 --> 00:02:54.958\nIn China, recycling is a major issue.\n\n00:02:54.958 --> 00:02:57.958\nAnd they are collected en mass -- you can see the scale of it here --\n\n00:02:57.958 --> 00:03:01.958\nand sorted out, by hand, back into the right sizes,\n\n00:03:01.958 --> 00:03:03.958\nand then put back out on the street.\n\n00:03:03.958 --> 00:03:06.958\nSo recycling and reuse\n\n00:03:06.958 --> 00:03:08.958\nare the major issues here.\n\n00:03:08.958 --> 00:03:11.958\nBut there was one interesting anecdote that I found in Indonesia.\n\n00:03:11.958 --> 00:03:13.958\nIn all schools in Indonesia,\n\n00:03:13.958 --> 00:03:15.958\nthere is usually a toy seller in the playground.\n\n00:03:15.958 --> 00:03:17.958\nThe toy seller, in this case,\n\n00:03:17.958 --> 00:03:19.958\nhad syringes, which they usually do,\n\n00:03:19.958 --> 00:03:21.958\nnext door to the diggers, which is obviously\n\n00:03:21.958 --> 00:03:23.958\nwhat you would expect.\n\n00:03:23.958 --> 00:03:25.958\nAnd they use them, in the breaks, for water pistols.\n\n00:03:25.958 --> 00:03:27.958\nThey squirt them at each other, which is lovely and innocent.\n\n00:03:27.958 --> 00:03:29.958\nAnd they are having great fun.\n\n00:03:29.958 --> 00:03:31.958\nBut they also drink from them\n\n00:03:31.958 --> 00:03:33.958\nwhile they're in their breaks, because it's hot.\n\n00:03:33.958 --> 00:03:36.958\nAnd they squirt the water into their mouths.\n\n00:03:36.958 --> 00:03:41.958\nAnd these are used with traces of blood visible.\n\n00:03:41.958 --> 00:03:43.958\nSo we need a better product. And we need better information.\n\n00:03:43.958 --> 00:03:48.958\nAnd I think, if I can just borrow this camera,\n\n00:03:48.958 --> 00:03:50.958\nI was going to show you my invention,\n\n00:03:50.958 --> 00:03:53.958\nwhich I came up with.\n\n00:03:53.958 --> 00:03:55.958\nSo, it's a normal-looking syringe.\n\n00:03:55.958 --> 00:03:57.958\nYou load it up in the normal way. This is made\n\n00:03:57.958 --> 00:04:01.958\non existing equipment in 14 factories that we license.\n\n00:04:01.958 --> 00:04:04.958\nYou give the injection and then put it down.\n\n00:04:04.958 --> 00:04:06.958\nIf someone then tries to reuse it,\n\n00:04:06.958 --> 00:04:08.958\nit locks and breaks afterwards.\n\n00:04:08.958 --> 00:04:10.958\nIt's very, very simple. Thank you.\n\n00:04:10.958 --> 00:04:13.958\n(Applause)\n\n00:04:13.958 --> 00:04:15.958\nAnd it costs the same as a normal syringe.\n\n00:04:15.958 --> 00:04:17.958\nAnd in comparison, a Coca-Cola\n\n00:04:17.958 --> 00:04:19.958\nis 10 times the price.\n\n00:04:19.958 --> 00:04:22.958\nAnd that will stop reusing a syringe 20 or 30 times.\n\n00:04:22.958 --> 00:04:24.958\nAnd I have an information charity\n\n00:04:24.958 --> 00:04:28.958\nwhich has done huge scale amount of work in India.\n\n00:04:28.958 --> 00:04:31.958\nAnd we're very proud of giving information to people,\n\n00:04:31.958 --> 00:04:33.958\nso that little kids like this don't do stupid things.\n\n00:04:33.958 --> 00:04:35.958\nThank you very much.\n\n00:04:35.958 --> 00:04:36.958\n(Applause)"}, {"title": "Navigating our global future", "duration": "426", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/ian_goldin_navigating_our_global_future", "transcript": "The future, as we know it, is very unpredictable. The best minds in the best institutions generally get it wrong. This is in technology. This is in the area of politics, where pundits, the CIA, MI6 always get it wrong. And it's clearly in the area of finance. With institutions established to think about the future, the IMF, the BIS, the Financial Stability Forum, couldn't see what was coming. Over 20,000 economists whose job it is, competitive entry to get there, couldn't see what was happening.Globalization is getting more complex. And this change is getting more rapid. The future will be more unpredictable. Urbanization, integration, coming together, leads to a new renaissance. It did this a thousand years ago. The last 40 years have been extraordinary times. Life expectancy has gone up by about 25 years. It took from the Stone Age to achieve that. Income has gone up for a majority of the world's population, despite the population going up by about two billion people over this period. And illiteracy has gone down, from a half to about a quarter of the people on Earth. A huge opportunity, unleashing of new potential for innovation, for development.But there is an underbelly. There are two Achilles' heels of globalization. There is the Achilles' heel of growing inequality \u2014 those that are left out, those that feel angry, those that are not participating. Globalization has not been inclusive. The second Achilles' heel is complexity \u2014 a growing fragility, a growing brittleness. What happens in one place very quickly affects everything else. This is a systemic risk, systemic shock. We've seen it in the financial crisis. We've seen it in the pandemic flu. It will become virulent and it's something we have to build resilience against.A lot of this is driven by what's happening in technology. There have been huge leaps. There will be a million-fold improvement in what you can get for the same price in computing by 2030. That's what the experience of the last 20 years has been. It will continue. Our computers, our systems will be as primitive as the Apollo's are for today. Our mobile phones are more powerful than the total Apollo space engine. Our mobile phones are more powerful than some of the strongest computers of 20 years ago. So what will this do? It will create huge opportunities in technology. Miniaturization as well. There will be invisible capacity. Invisible capacity in our bodies, in our brains, and in the air. This is a dust mite on a nanoreplica.This sort of ability to do everything in new ways unleashes potential, not least in the area of medicine. This is a stem cell that we've developed here in Oxford, from an embryonic stem cell. We can develop any part of the body. Increasingly, over time, this will be possible from our own skin \u2014 able to replicate parts of the body. Fantastic potential for regenerative medicine. I don't think there will be a Special Olympics long after 2030, because of this capacity to regenerate parts of the body. But the question is, \"Who will have it?\"The other major development is going to be in the area of what can happen in genetics. The capacity to create, as this mouse has been genetically modified, something which goes three times faster, lasts for three times longer, we could produce, as this mouse can, to the age of our equivalent of 80 years, using about the same amount of food. But will this only be available for the super rich, for those that can afford it? Are we headed for a new eugenics? Will only those that are able to afford it be able to be this super race of the future? (Laughter)So the big question for us is, \"How do we manage this technological change?\" How do we ensure that it creates a more inclusive technology, a technology which means that not only as we grow older, that we can also grow wiser, and that we're able to support the populations of the future? One of the most dramatic manifestations of these improvements will be moving from population pyramids to what we might term population coffins. There is unlikely to be a pension or a retirement age in 2030. These will be redundant concepts. And this isn't only something of the West.The most dramatic changes will be the skyscraper type of new pyramids that will take place in China and in many other countries. So forget about retirements if you're young. Forget about pensions. Think about life and where it's going to be going. Of course, migration will become even more important. The war on talent, the need to attract people at all skill ranges, to push us around in our wheelchairs, but also to drive our economies. Our innovation will be vital.The employment in the rich countries will go down from about 800 to about 700 million of these people. This would imply a massive leap in migration. So the concerns, the xenophobic concerns of today, of migration, will be turned on their head, as we search for people to help us sort out our pensions and our economies in the future. And then, the systemic risks. We understand that these will become much more virulent, that what we see today is this interweaving of societies, of systems, fastened by technologies and hastened by just-in-time management systems. Small levels of stock push resilience into other people's responsibility.The collapse in biodiversity, climate change, pandemics, financial crises: these will be the currency that we will think about. And so a new awareness will have to arise, of how we deal with these, how we mobilize ourselves, in a new way, and come together as a community to manage systemic risk. It's going to require innovation. It's going to require an understanding that the glory of globalization could also be its downfall. This could be our best century ever because of the achievements, or it could be our worst. And of course we need to worry about the individuals, particularly the individuals that feel that they've been left out in one way or another.An individual, for the first time in the history of humanity, will have the capacity, by 2030, to destroy the planet, to wreck everything, through the creation, for example, of a biopathogen. How do we begin to weave these tapestries together? How do we think about complex systems in new ways? That will be the challenge of the scholars, and of all of us engaged in thinking about the future. The rest of our lives will be in the future. We need to prepare for it now. We need to understand that the governance structure in the world is fossilized. It cannot begin to cope with the challenges that this will bring. We have to develop a new way of managing the planet, collectively, through collective wisdom.We know, and I know from my own experience, that amazing things can happen, when individuals and societies come together to change their future. I left South Africa, and 15 years later, after thinking I would never go back, I had the privilege and the honor to work in the government of Nelson Mandela. This was a miracle. We can create miracles, collectively, in our lifetime. It is vital that we do so. It is vital that the ideas that are nurtured in TED, that the ideas that we think about look forward, and make sure that this will be the most glorious century, and not one of eco-disaster and eco-collapse.

Wondering, therefore, how to explain what they saw in terms of things unseen.Okay, so, most people only wondered that occasionally, like today, in breaks from whatever normally preoccupied them. But what normally preoccupied them also involved yearning to know. They wished they knew how to prevent their food supply from sometimes failing, and how they could rest when they were tired without risking starvation, be warmer, cooler, safer, in less pain. I bet those prehistoric cave artists would have loved to know how to draw better.In every aspect of their lives, they wished for progress, just as we do. But they failed, almost completely, to make any. They didn't know how to. Discoveries like fire happened so rarely, that from an individual's point of view, the world never improved. Nothing new was learned.The first clue to the origin of starlight happened as recently as 1899: radioactivity. Within 40 years, physicists discovered the whole explanation, expressed, as usual, in elegant symbols. But never mind the symbols. Think how many discoveries they represent. Nuclei and nuclear reactions, of course. But isotopes, particles of electricity, antimatter, neutrinos, the conversion of mass to energy \u2014 that's E=mc^2 \u2014 gamma rays, transmutation. That ancient dream that had always eluded the alchemists was achieved through these same theories that explained starlight and other ancient mysteries, and new, unexpected phenomena.That all that, discovered in 40 years, had not been in the previous hundred thousand, was not for lack of thinking about stars, and all those other urgent problems they had. They even arrived at answers, such as myths, that dominated their lives, yet bore almost no resemblance to the truth. The tragedy of that protracted stagnation isn't sufficiently recognized, I think. These were people with brains of essentially the same design that eventually did discover all those things. But that ability to make progress remained almost unused, until the event that revolutionized the human condition and changed the universe.Or so we should hope. Because that event was the Scientific Revolution, ever since which our knowledge of the physical world, and of how to adapt it to our wishes, has been growing relentlessly. Now, what had changed? What were people now doing for the first time that made that difference between stagnation and rapid, open-ended discovery? How to make that difference is surely the most important universal truth that it is possible to know. Worryingly, there is no consensus about what it is. So, I'll tell you. But I'll have to backtrack a little first.Before the Scientific Revolution, they believed that everything important, knowable, was already known, enshrined in ancient writings, institutions, and in some genuinely useful rules of thumb \u2014 which were, however, entrenched as dogmas, along with many falsehoods. So they believed that knowledge came from authorities that actually knew very little. And therefore progress depended on learning how to reject the authority of learned men, priests, traditions and rulers. Which is why the Scientific Revolution had to have a wider context.The Enlightenment, a revolution in how people sought knowledge, trying not to rely on authority. \"Take no one's word for it.\" But that can't be what made the difference. Authorities had been rejected before, many times. And that rarely, if ever, caused anything like the Scientific Revolution. At the time, what they thought distinguished science was a radical idea about things unseen, known as empiricism. All knowledge derives from the senses. Well, we've seen that that can't be true. It did help by promoting observation and experiment. But, from the outset, it was obvious that there was something horribly wrong with it.Knowledge comes from the senses. In what language? Certainly not the language of mathematics, in which, Galileo rightly said, the book of nature is written. Look at the world. You don't see equations carved on to the mountainsides. If you did, it would be because people had carved them. By the way, why don't we do that? What's wrong with us? (Laughter)Empiricism is inadequate because, well, scientific theories explain the seen in terms of the unseen. And the unseen, you have to admit, doesn't come to us through the senses. We don't see those nuclear reactions in stars. We don't see the origin of species. We don't see the curvature of space-time, and other universes. But we know about those things. How?Well, the classic empiricist answer is induction. The unseen resembles the seen. But it doesn't. You know what the clinching evidence was that space-time is curved? It was a photograph, not of space-time, but of an eclipse, with a dot there rather than there. And the evidence for evolution? Some rocks and some finches. And parallel universes? Again: dots there, rather than there, on a screen. What we see, in all these cases, bears no resemblance to the reality that we conclude is responsible \u2014 only a long chain of theoretical reasoning and interpretation connects them.\"Ah!\" say creationists. \"So you admit it's all interpretation. No one has ever seen evolution. We see rocks. You have your interpretation. We have ours. Yours comes from guesswork, ours from the Bible.\" But what creationist and empiricists both ignore is that, in that sense, no one has ever seen a bible either, that the eye only detects light, which we don't perceive. Brains only detect nerve impulses. And they don't perceive even those as what they really are, namely electrical crackles. So we perceive nothing as what it really is.Our connection to reality is never just perception. It's always, as Karl Popper put it, theory-laden. Scientific knowledge isn't derived from anything. It's like all knowledge. It's conjectural, guesswork, tested by observation, not derived from it. So, were testable conjectures the great innovation that opened the intellectual prison gates? No. Contrary to what's usually said, testability is common, in myths and all sorts of other irrational modes of thinking. Any crank claiming the sun will go out next Tuesday has got a testable prediction.Consider the ancient Greek myth explaining seasons. Hades, God of the Underworld, kidnaps Persephone, the Goddess of Spring, and negotiates a forced marriage contract, requiring her to return regularly, and lets her go. And each year, she is magically compelled to return. And her mother, Demeter, Goddess of the Earth, is sad, and makes it cold and barren. That myth is testable. If winter is caused by Demeter's sadness, then it must happen everywhere on Earth simultaneously. So if the ancient Greeks had only known that Australia is at its warmest when Demeter is at her saddest, they'd have known that their theory is false.So what was wrong with that myth, and with all pre-scientific thinking, and what, then, made that momentous difference? I think there is one thing you have to care about. And that implies testability, the scientific method, the Enlightenment, and everything. And here is the crucial thing. There is such a thing as a defect in a story. I don't just mean a logical defect. I mean a bad explanation. What does that mean? Well, explanation is an assertion about what's there, unseen, that accounts for what's seen.Because the explanatory role of Persephone's marriage contract could be played equally well by infinitely many other ad hoc entities. Why a marriage contract and not any other reason for regular annual action? Here is one. Persephone wasn't released. She escaped, and returns every spring to take revenge on Hades, with her Spring powers. She cools his domain with Spring air, venting heat up to the surface, creating summer. That accounts for the same phenomena as the original myth. It's equally testable. Yet what it asserts about reality is, in many ways, the opposite. And that is possible because the details of the original myth are unrelated to seasons, except via the myth itself.This easy variability is the sign of a bad explanation, because, without a functional reason to prefer one of countless variants, advocating one of them, in preference to the others, is irrational. So, for the essence of what makes the difference to enable progress, seek good explanations, the ones that can't be easily varied, while still explaining the phenomena.Now, our current explanation of seasons is that the Earth's axis is tilted like that, so each hemisphere tilts toward the sun for half the year, and away for the other half. Better put that up. (Laughter) That's a good explanation: hard to vary, because every detail plays a functional role. For instance, we know, independently of seasons, that surfaces tilted away from radiant heat are heated less, and that a spinning sphere, in space, points in a constant direction. And the tilt also explains the sun's angle of elevation at different times of year, and predicts that the seasons will be out of phase in the two hemispheres. If they'd been observed in phase, the theory would have been refuted. But now, the fact that it's also a good explanation, hard to vary, makes the crucial difference.If the ancient Greeks had found out about seasons in Australia, they could have easily varied their myth to predict that. For instance, when Demeter is upset, she banishes heat from her vicinity, into the other hemisphere, where it makes summer. So, being proved wrong by observation, and changing their theory accordingly, still wouldn't have got the ancient Greeks one jot closer to understanding seasons, because their explanation was bad: easy to vary. And it's only when an explanation is good that it even matters whether it's testable. If the axis-tilt theory had been refuted, its defenders would have had nowhere to go. No easily implemented change could make that tilt cause the same seasons in both hemispheres.The search for hard-to-vary explanations is the origin of all progress. It's the basic regulating principle of the Enlightenment. So, in science, two false approaches blight progress. One is well known: untestable theories. But the more important one is explanationless theories. Whenever you're told that some existing statistical trend will continue, but you aren't given a hard-to-vary account of what causes that trend, you're being told a wizard did it.When you are told that carrots have human rights because they share half our genes \u2014 but not how gene percentages confer rights \u2014 wizard. When someone announces that the nature-nurture debate has been settled because there is evidence that a given percentage of our political opinions are genetically inherited, but they don't explain how genes cause opinions, they've settled nothing. They are saying that our opinions are caused by wizards, and presumably so are their own. That the truth consists of hard to vary assertions about reality is the most important fact about the physical world. It's a fact that is, itself, unseen, yet impossible to vary. Thank you.

yearning to know.\n\n00:00:56.958 --> 00:00:59.958\nThey wished they knew\n\n00:00:59.958 --> 00:01:01.958\nhow to prevent their food supply\n\n00:01:01.958 --> 00:01:03.958\nfrom sometimes failing,\n\n00:01:03.958 --> 00:01:06.958\nand how they could rest when they were tired\n\n00:01:06.958 --> 00:01:10.958\nwithout risking starvation,\n\n00:01:10.958 --> 00:01:14.958\nbe warmer, cooler, safer,\n\n00:01:14.958 --> 00:01:16.958\nin less pain.\n\n00:01:16.958 --> 00:01:19.958\nI bet those prehistoric cave artists\n\n00:01:19.958 --> 00:01:21.958\nwould have loved to know\n\n00:01:21.958 --> 00:01:23.958\nhow to draw better.\n\n00:01:23.958 --> 00:01:28.958\nIn every aspect of their lives,\n\n00:01:28.958 --> 00:01:33.958\nthey wished for progress, just as we do.\n\n00:01:33.958 --> 00:01:39.958\nBut they failed, almost completely, to make any.\n\n00:01:39.958 --> 00:01:42.958\nThey didn't know how to.\n\n00:01:42.958 --> 00:01:46.958\nDiscoveries like fire\n\n00:01:46.958 --> 00:01:50.958\nhappened so rarely, that from an individual's point of view,\n\n00:01:50.958 --> 00:01:53.958\nthe world never improved.\n\n00:01:53.958 --> 00:01:57.958\nNothing new was learned.\n\n00:01:57.958 --> 00:02:00.958\nThe first clue to the origin of starlight\n\n00:02:00.958 --> 00:02:07.958\nhappened as recently as 1899: radioactivity.\n\n00:02:07.958 --> 00:02:09.958\nWithin 40 years,\n\n00:02:09.958 --> 00:02:13.958\nphysicists discovered the whole explanation,\n\n00:02:13.958 --> 00:02:18.958\nexpressed, as usual, in elegant symbols.\n\n00:02:18.958 --> 00:02:20.958\nBut never mind the symbols.\n\n00:02:20.958 --> 00:02:24.958\nThink how many discoveries\n\n00:02:24.958 --> 00:02:26.958\nthey represent.\n\n00:02:26.958 --> 00:02:29.958\nNuclei and nuclear reactions, of course.\n\n00:02:29.958 --> 00:02:36.958\nBut isotopes, particles of electricity,\n\n00:02:36.958 --> 00:02:40.958\nantimatter,\n\n00:02:40.958 --> 00:02:42.958\nneutrinos,\n\n00:02:42.958 --> 00:02:46.958\nthe conversion of mass to energy -- that's E=mc^2 --\n\n00:02:46.958 --> 00:02:48.958\ngamma rays,\n\n00:02:48.958 --> 00:02:52.958\ntransmutation.\n\n00:02:52.958 --> 00:02:57.958\nThat ancient dream that had always eluded the alchemists\n\n00:02:57.958 --> 00:02:59.958\nwas achieved through these same theories\n\n00:02:59.958 --> 00:03:01.958\nthat explained starlight\n\n00:03:01.958 --> 00:03:04.958\nand other ancient mysteries,\n\n00:03:04.958 --> 00:03:07.958\nand new, unexpected phenomena.\n\n00:03:07.958 --> 00:03:11.958\nThat all that, discovered in 40 years,\n\n00:03:11.958 --> 00:03:14.958\nhad not been in the previous hundred thousand,\n\n00:03:14.958 --> 00:03:18.958\nwas not for lack of thinking\n\n00:03:18.958 --> 00:03:22.958\nabout stars, and all those other urgent problems they had.\n\n00:03:22.958 --> 00:03:25.958\nThey even arrived at answers,\n\n00:03:25.958 --> 00:03:27.958\nsuch as myths,\n\n00:03:27.958 --> 00:03:29.958\nthat dominated their lives,\n\n00:03:29.958 --> 00:03:33.958\nyet bore almost no resemblance\n\n00:03:33.958 --> 00:03:35.958\nto the truth.\n\n00:03:35.958 --> 00:03:40.958\nThe tragedy of that protracted stagnation\n\n00:03:40.958 --> 00:03:42.958\nisn't sufficiently recognized, I think.\n\n00:03:42.958 --> 00:03:44.958\nThese were people with brains of\n\n00:03:44.958 --> 00:03:47.958\nessentially the same design\n\n00:03:47.958 --> 00:03:52.958\nthat eventually did discover all those things.\n\n00:03:52.958 --> 00:03:56.958\nBut that ability to make progress\n\n00:03:56.958 --> 00:03:59.958\nremained almost unused,\n\n00:03:59.958 --> 00:04:02.958\nuntil the event that\n\n00:04:02.958 --> 00:04:04.958\nrevolutionized the human condition\n\n00:04:04.958 --> 00:04:06.958\nand changed the universe.\n\n00:04:06.958 --> 00:04:08.958\nOr so we should hope.\n\n00:04:08.958 --> 00:04:10.958\nBecause that event was the\n\n00:04:10.958 --> 00:04:12.958\nScientific Revolution,\n\n00:04:12.958 --> 00:04:14.958\never since which our knowledge\n\n00:04:14.958 --> 00:04:16.958\nof the physical world,\n\n00:04:16.958 --> 00:04:20.958\nand of how to adapt it to our wishes,\n\n00:04:20.958 --> 00:04:22.958\nhas been growing relentlessly.\n\n00:04:22.958 --> 00:04:25.958\nNow, what had changed?\n\n00:04:25.958 --> 00:04:27.958\nWhat were people now doing for the first time\n\n00:04:27.958 --> 00:04:29.958\nthat made that difference\n\n00:04:29.958 --> 00:04:31.958\nbetween stagnation\n\n00:04:31.958 --> 00:04:35.958\nand rapid, open-ended discovery?\n\n00:04:35.958 --> 00:04:37.958\nHow to make that difference\n\n00:04:37.958 --> 00:04:41.958\nis surely the most important universal truth\n\n00:04:41.958 --> 00:04:43.958\nthat it is possible to know.\n\n00:04:43.958 --> 00:04:48.958\nWorryingly, there is no consensus about what it is.\n\n00:04:48.958 --> 00:04:50.958\nSo, I'll tell you.\n\n00:04:50.958 --> 00:04:54.958\nBut I'll have to backtrack a little first.\n\n00:04:54.958 --> 00:04:57.958\nBefore the Scientific Revolution,\n\n00:04:57.958 --> 00:05:00.958\nthey believed that everything important, knowable,\n\n00:05:00.958 --> 00:05:02.958\nwas already known,\n\n00:05:02.958 --> 00:05:05.958\nenshrined in ancient writings, institutions,\n\n00:05:05.958 --> 00:05:08.958\nand in some genuinely useful rules of thumb --\n\n00:05:08.958 --> 00:05:12.958\nwhich were, however, entrenched as dogmas,\n\n00:05:12.958 --> 00:05:14.958\nalong with many falsehoods.\n\n00:05:14.958 --> 00:05:18.958\nSo they believed that knowledge came from authorities\n\n00:05:18.958 --> 00:05:21.958\nthat actually knew very little.\n\n00:05:21.958 --> 00:05:24.958\nAnd therefore progress\n\n00:05:24.958 --> 00:05:27.958\ndepended on learning how to reject\n\n00:05:27.958 --> 00:05:30.958\nthe authority of learned men,\n\n00:05:30.958 --> 00:05:34.958\npriests, traditions and rulers.\n\n00:05:34.958 --> 00:05:37.958\nWhich is why the Scientific Revolution\n\n00:05:37.958 --> 00:05:39.958\nhad to have a wider context.\n\n00:05:39.958 --> 00:05:43.958\nThe Enlightenment, a revolution in how\n\n00:05:43.958 --> 00:05:46.958\npeople sought knowledge,\n\n00:05:46.958 --> 00:05:49.958\ntrying not to rely on authority.\n\n00:05:49.958 --> 00:05:51.958\n\"Take no one's word for it.\"\n\n00:05:51.958 --> 00:05:55.958\nBut that can't be what made the difference.\n\n00:05:55.958 --> 00:05:57.958\nAuthorities had been rejected before, many times.\n\n00:05:57.958 --> 00:05:59.958\nAnd that rarely, if ever,\n\n00:05:59.958 --> 00:06:03.958\ncaused anything like the Scientific Revolution.\n\n00:06:03.958 --> 00:06:05.958\nAt the time, what they thought\n\n00:06:05.958 --> 00:06:07.958\ndistinguished science\n\n00:06:07.958 --> 00:06:11.958\nwas a radical idea about things unseen,\n\n00:06:11.958 --> 00:06:14.958\nknown as empiricism.\n\n00:06:14.958 --> 00:06:19.958\nAll knowledge derives from the senses.\n\n00:06:19.958 --> 00:06:22.958\nWell, we've seen that that can't be true.\n\n00:06:22.958 --> 00:06:26.958\nIt did help by promoting\n\n00:06:26.958 --> 00:06:28.958\nobservation and experiment.\n\n00:06:28.958 --> 00:06:30.958\nBut, from the outset, it was obvious\n\n00:06:30.958 --> 00:06:33.958\nthat there was something horribly wrong with it.\n\n00:06:33.958 --> 00:06:35.958\nKnowledge comes from the senses.\n\n00:06:35.958 --> 00:06:38.958\nIn what language? Certainly not the language of mathematics,\n\n00:06:38.958 --> 00:06:41.958\nin which, Galileo rightly said,\n\n00:06:41.958 --> 00:06:44.958\nthe book of nature is written.\n\n00:06:44.958 --> 00:06:47.958\nLook at the world. You don't see equations\n\n00:06:47.958 --> 00:06:50.958\ncarved on to the mountainsides.\n\n00:06:50.958 --> 00:06:52.958\nIf you did, it would be because people\n\n00:06:52.958 --> 00:06:54.958\nhad carved them.\n\n00:06:54.958 --> 00:06:57.958\nBy the way, why don't we do that?\n\n00:06:57.958 --> 00:06:59.958\nWhat's wrong with us?\n\n00:06:59.958 --> 00:07:00.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:07:00.958 --> 00:07:02.958\nEmpiricism is inadequate\n\n00:07:02.958 --> 00:07:04.958\nbecause, well,\n\n00:07:04.958 --> 00:07:09.958\nscientific theories explain the seen in terms of the unseen.\n\n00:07:09.958 --> 00:07:11.958\nAnd the unseen, you have to admit,\n\n00:07:11.958 --> 00:07:13.958\ndoesn't come to us through the senses.\n\n00:07:13.958 --> 00:07:17.958\nWe don't see those nuclear reactions in stars.\n\n00:07:17.958 --> 00:07:20.958\nWe don't see the origin of species.\n\n00:07:20.958 --> 00:07:24.958\nWe don't see the curvature of space-time,\n\n00:07:24.958 --> 00:07:26.958\nand other universes.\n\n00:07:26.958 --> 00:07:29.958\nBut we know about those things.\n\n00:07:29.958 --> 00:07:31.958\nHow?\n\n00:07:31.958 --> 00:07:36.958\nWell, the classic empiricist answer is induction.\n\n00:07:36.958 --> 00:07:40.958\nThe unseen resembles the seen.\n\n00:07:40.958 --> 00:07:42.958\nBut it doesn't.\n\n00:07:42.958 --> 00:07:44.958\nYou know what the clinching evidence was\n\n00:07:44.958 --> 00:07:47.958\nthat space-time is curved?\n\n00:07:47.958 --> 00:07:50.958\nIt was a photograph, not of space-time,\n\n00:07:50.958 --> 00:07:54.958\nbut of an eclipse, with a dot there rather than there.\n\n00:07:54.958 --> 00:07:56.958\nAnd the evidence for evolution?\n\n00:07:56.958 --> 00:07:59.958\nSome rocks and some finches.\n\n00:07:59.958 --> 00:08:02.958\nAnd parallel universes? Again: dots there,\n\n00:08:02.958 --> 00:08:04.958\nrather than there, on a screen.\n\n00:08:04.958 --> 00:08:07.958\nWhat we see, in all these cases,\n\n00:08:07.958 --> 00:08:11.958\nbears no resemblance to the reality\n\n00:08:11.958 --> 00:08:13.958\nthat we conclude is responsible --\n\n00:08:13.958 --> 00:08:17.958\nonly a long chain of theoretical reasoning\n\n00:08:17.958 --> 00:08:19.958\nand interpretation connects them.\n\n00:08:19.958 --> 00:08:22.958\n\"Ah!\" say creationists.\n\n00:08:22.958 --> 00:08:24.958\n\"So you admit it's all interpretation.\n\n00:08:24.958 --> 00:08:27.958\nNo one has ever seen evolution.\n\n00:08:27.958 --> 00:08:29.958\nWe see rocks.\n\n00:08:29.958 --> 00:08:32.958\nYou have your interpretation. We have ours.\n\n00:08:32.958 --> 00:08:34.958\nYours comes from guesswork,\n\n00:08:34.958 --> 00:08:36.958\nours from the Bible.\"\n\n00:08:36.958 --> 00:08:42.958\nBut what creationist and empiricists both ignore\n\n00:08:42.958 --> 00:08:44.958\nis that, in that sense,\n\n00:08:44.958 --> 00:08:47.958\nno one has ever seen a bible either,\n\n00:08:47.958 --> 00:08:51.958\nthat the eye only detects light, which we don't perceive.\n\n00:08:51.958 --> 00:08:54.958\nBrains only detect nerve impulses.\n\n00:08:54.958 --> 00:08:57.958\nAnd they don't perceive even those as what they really are,\n\n00:08:57.958 --> 00:08:59.958\nnamely electrical crackles.\n\n00:08:59.958 --> 00:09:04.958\nSo we perceive nothing as what it really is.\n\n00:09:04.958 --> 00:09:07.958\nOur connection to reality\n\n00:09:07.958 --> 00:09:09.958\nis never just perception.\n\n00:09:09.958 --> 00:09:13.958\nIt's always, as Karl Popper put it,\n\n00:09:13.958 --> 00:09:16.958\ntheory-laden.\n\n00:09:16.958 --> 00:09:19.958\nScientific knowledge isn't derived from anything.\n\n00:09:19.958 --> 00:09:24.958\nIt's like all knowledge.

I mean a bad explanation.\n\n00:11:18.958 --> 00:11:21.958\nWhat does that mean? Well, explanation\n\n00:11:21.958 --> 00:11:24.958\nis an assertion about what's there, unseen,\n\n00:11:24.958 --> 00:11:27.958\nthat accounts for what's seen.\n\n00:11:27.958 --> 00:11:30.958\nBecause the explanatory role\n\n00:11:30.958 --> 00:11:32.958\nof Persephone's marriage contract\n\n00:11:32.958 --> 00:11:34.958\ncould be played equally well\n\n00:11:34.958 --> 00:11:36.958\nby infinitely many other\n\n00:11:36.958 --> 00:11:38.958\nad hoc entities.\n\n00:11:38.958 --> 00:11:41.958\nWhy a marriage contract and not any other reason\n\n00:11:41.958 --> 00:11:45.958\nfor regular annual action?\n\n00:11:45.958 --> 00:11:48.958\nHere is one. Persephone wasn't released.\n\n00:11:48.958 --> 00:11:52.958\nShe escaped, and returns every spring\n\n00:11:52.958 --> 00:11:54.958\nto take revenge on Hades,\n\n00:11:54.958 --> 00:11:56.958\nwith her Spring powers.\n\n00:11:56.958 --> 00:12:01.958\nShe cools his domain with Spring air,\n\n00:12:01.958 --> 00:12:05.958\nventing heat up to the surface, creating summer.\n\n00:12:05.958 --> 00:12:09.958\nThat accounts for the same phenomena as the original myth.\n\n00:12:09.958 --> 00:12:12.958\nIt's equally testable.\n\n00:12:12.958 --> 00:12:15.958\nYet what it asserts about reality\n\n00:12:15.958 --> 00:12:17.958\nis, in many ways, the opposite.\n\n00:12:17.958 --> 00:12:19.958\nAnd that is possible because\n\n00:12:19.958 --> 00:12:22.958\nthe details of the original myth\n\n00:12:22.958 --> 00:12:24.958\nare unrelated to seasons,\n\n00:12:24.958 --> 00:12:28.958\nexcept via the myth itself.\n\n00:12:28.958 --> 00:12:31.958\nThis easy variability\n\n00:12:31.958 --> 00:12:35.958\nis the sign of a bad explanation,\n\n00:12:35.958 --> 00:12:39.958\nbecause, without a functional reason to prefer\n\n00:12:39.958 --> 00:12:44.958\none of countless variants,\n\n00:12:44.958 --> 00:12:46.958\nadvocating one of them, in preference to the others,\n\n00:12:46.958 --> 00:12:48.958\nis irrational.\n\n00:12:48.958 --> 00:12:50.958\nSo, for the essence of what\n\n00:12:50.958 --> 00:12:53.958\nmakes the difference to enable progress,\n\n00:12:53.958 --> 00:12:55.958\nseek good explanations,\n\n00:12:55.958 --> 00:12:58.958\nthe ones that can't be easily varied,\n\n00:12:58.958 --> 00:13:03.958\nwhile still explaining the phenomena.\n\n00:13:03.958 --> 00:13:06.958\nNow, our current explanation of seasons\n\n00:13:06.958 --> 00:13:10.958\nis that the Earth's axis is tilted like that,\n\n00:13:10.958 --> 00:13:13.958\nso each hemisphere tilts toward the sun for half the year,\n\n00:13:13.958 --> 00:13:16.958\nand away for the other half.\n\n00:13:16.958 --> 00:13:18.958\nBetter put that up.\n\n00:13:18.958 --> 00:13:19.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:13:19.958 --> 00:13:24.958\nThat's a good explanation: hard to vary,\n\n00:13:24.958 --> 00:13:27.958\nbecause every detail plays a functional role.\n\n00:13:27.958 --> 00:13:30.958\nFor instance, we know, independently of seasons,\n\n00:13:30.958 --> 00:13:32.958\nthat surfaces tilted away\n\n00:13:32.958 --> 00:13:35.958\nfrom radiant heat are heated less,\n\n00:13:35.958 --> 00:13:38.958\nand that a spinning sphere, in space,\n\n00:13:38.958 --> 00:13:41.958\npoints in a constant direction.\n\n00:13:41.958 --> 00:13:44.958\nAnd the tilt also explains\n\n00:13:44.958 --> 00:13:48.958\nthe sun's angle of elevation at different times of year,\n\n00:13:48.958 --> 00:13:50.958\nand predicts that the seasons\n\n00:13:50.958 --> 00:13:53.958\nwill be out of phase in the two hemispheres.\n\n00:13:53.958 --> 00:13:55.958\nIf they'd been observed in phase,\n\n00:13:55.958 --> 00:13:57.958\nthe theory would have been refuted.\n\n00:13:57.958 --> 00:14:02.958\nBut now, the fact that it's also a good explanation,\n\n00:14:02.958 --> 00:14:07.958\nhard to vary, makes the crucial difference.\n\n00:14:07.958 --> 00:14:09.958\nIf the ancient Greeks had found out\n\n00:14:09.958 --> 00:14:12.958\nabout seasons in Australia,\n\n00:14:12.958 --> 00:14:14.958\nthey could have easily varied their myth\n\n00:14:14.958 --> 00:14:16.958\nto predict that.\n\n00:14:16.958 --> 00:14:18.958\nFor instance, when Demeter is upset,\n\n00:14:18.958 --> 00:14:21.958\nshe banishes heat from her vicinity,\n\n00:14:21.958 --> 00:14:24.958\ninto the other hemisphere, where it makes summer.\n\n00:14:24.958 --> 00:14:27.958\nSo, being proved wrong by observation,\n\n00:14:27.958 --> 00:14:29.958\nand changing their theory accordingly,\n\n00:14:29.958 --> 00:14:32.958\nstill wouldn't have got the ancient Greeks\n\n00:14:32.958 --> 00:14:35.958\none jot closer to understanding seasons,\n\n00:14:35.958 --> 00:14:38.958\nbecause their explanation was bad: easy to vary.\n\n00:14:38.958 --> 00:14:41.958\nAnd it's only when an explanation is good\n\n00:14:41.958 --> 00:14:43.958\nthat it even matters whether it's testable.\n\n00:14:43.958 --> 00:14:46.958\nIf the axis-tilt theory had been refuted,\n\n00:14:46.958 --> 00:14:48.958\nits defenders would have had nowhere to go.\n\n00:14:48.958 --> 00:14:51.958\nNo easily implemented change\n\n00:14:51.958 --> 00:14:53.958\ncould make that tilt\n\n00:14:53.958 --> 00:14:58.958\ncause the same seasons in both hemispheres.\n\n00:14:58.958 --> 00:15:01.958\nThe search for hard-to-vary explanations\n\n00:15:01.958 --> 00:15:04.958\nis the origin of all progress.\n\n00:15:04.958 --> 00:15:07.958\nIt's the basic regulating principle\n\n00:15:07.958 --> 00:15:09.958\nof the Enlightenment.\n\n00:15:09.958 --> 00:15:13.958\nSo, in science, two false approaches blight progress.\n\n00:15:13.958 --> 00:15:16.958\nOne is well known: untestable theories.\n\n00:15:16.958 --> 00:15:20.958\nBut the more important one is explanationless theories.\n\n00:15:20.958 --> 00:15:24.958\nWhenever you're told that some existing statistical trend will continue,\n\n00:15:24.958 --> 00:15:27.958\nbut you aren't given a hard-to-vary account\n\n00:15:27.958 --> 00:15:30.958\nof what causes that

They're made using Victorian technologies. This involves blueprints, industrial manufacturing and construction using teams of workers. All of this effort results in an inert object. And that means that there is a one-way transfer of energy from our environment into our homes and cities. This is not sustainable. I believe that the only way that it is possible for us to construct genuinely sustainable homes and cities is by connecting them to nature, not insulating them from it.Now, in order to do this, we need the right kind of language. Living systems are in constant conversation with the natural world, through sets of chemical reactions called metabolism. And this is the conversion of one group of substances into another, either through the production or the absorption of energy. And this is the way in which living materials make the most of their local resources in a sustainable way. So, I'm interested in the use of metabolic materials for the practice of architecture. But they don't exist. So I'm having to make them.I'm working with architect Neil Spiller at the Bartlett School of Architecture, and we're collaborating with international scientists in order to generate these new materials from a bottom up approach. That means we're generating them from scratch. One of our collaborators is chemist Martin Hanczyc, and he's really interested in the transition from inert to living matter. Now, that's exactly the kind of process that I'm interested in, when we're thinking about sustainable materials.So, Martin, he works with a system called the protocell. Now all this is \u2014 and it's magic \u2014 is a little fatty bag. And it's got a chemical battery in it. And it has no DNA. This little bag is able to conduct itself in a way that can only be described as living. It is able to move around its environment. It can follow chemical gradients. It can undergo complex reactions, some of which are happily architectural. So here we are. These are protocells, patterning their environment. We don't know how they do that yet. Here, this is a protocell, and it's vigorously shedding this skin. Now, this looks like a chemical kind of birth. This is a violent process.Here, we've got a protocell to extract carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere and turn it into carbonate. And that's the shell around that globular fat. They are quite brittle. So you've only got a part of one there. So what we're trying to do is, we're trying to push these technologies towards creating bottom-up construction approaches for architecture, which contrast the current, Victorian, top-down methods which impose structure upon matter. That can't be energetically sensible.So, bottom-up materials actually exist today. They've been in use, in architecture, since ancient times. If you walk around the city of Oxford, where we are today, and have a look at the brickwork, which I've enjoyed doing in the last couple of days, you'll actually see that a lot of it is made of limestone. And if you look even closer, you'll see, in that limestone, there are little shells and little skeletons that are piled upon each other. And then they are fossilized over millions of years.Now a block of limestone, in itself, isn't particularly that interesting. It looks beautiful. But imagine what the properties of this limestone block might be if the surfaces were actually in conversation with the atmosphere. Maybe they could extract carbon dioxide. Would it give this block of limestone new properties? Well, most likely it would. It might be able to grow. It might be able to self-repair, and even respond to dramatic changes in the immediate environment.So, architects are never happy with just one block of an interesting material. They think big. Okay? So when we think about scaling up metabolic materials, we can start thinking about ecological interventions like repair of atolls, or reclamation of parts of a city that are damaged by water. So, one of these examples would of course be the historic city of Venice. Now, Venice, as you know, has a tempestuous relationship with the sea, and is built upon wooden piles. So we've devised a way by which it may be possible for the protocell technology that we're working with to sustainably reclaim Venice. And architect Christian Kerrigan has come up with a series of designs that show us how it may be possible to actually grow a limestone reef underneath the city.So, here is the technology we have today. This is our protocell technology, effectively making a shell, like its limestone forefathers, and depositing it in a very complex environment, against natural materials. We're looking at crystal lattices to see the bonding process in this. Now, this is the very interesting part. We don't just want limestone dumped everywhere in all the pretty canals. What we need it to do is to be creatively crafted around the wooden piles.So, you can see from these diagrams that the protocell is actually moving away from the light, toward the dark foundations. We've observed this in the laboratory. The protocells can actually move away from the light. They can actually also move towards the light. You have to just choose your species. So that these don't just exist as one entity, we kind of chemically engineer them. And so here the protocells are depositing their limestone very specifically, around the foundations of Venice, effectively petrifying it.Now, this isn't going to happen tomorrow. It's going to take a while. It's going to take years of tuning and monitoring this technology in order for us to become ready to test it out in a case-by-case basis on the most damaged and stressed buildings within the city of Venice. But gradually, as the buildings are repaired, we will see the accretion of a limestone reef beneath the city. An accretion itself is a huge sink of carbon dioxide. Also it will attract the local marine ecology, who will find their own ecological niches within this architecture.So, this is really interesting. Now we have an architecture that connects a city to the natural world in a very direct and immediate way. But perhaps the most exciting thing about it is that the driver of this technology is available everywhere. This is terrestrial chemistry. We've all got it, which means that this technology is just as appropriate for developing countries as it is for First World countries. So, in summary, I'm generating metabolic materials as a counterpoise to Victorian technologies, and building architectures from a bottom-up approach.Secondly, these metabolic materials have some of the properties of living systems, which means they can perform in similar ways. They can expect to have a lot of forms and functions within the practice of architecture. And finally, an observer in the future marveling at a beautiful structure in the environment may find it almost impossible to tell whether this structure has been created by a natural process or an artificial one.

So I'm having to make them.\n\n00:01:26.958 --> 00:01:28.958\nI'm working with architect Neil Spiller\n\n00:01:28.958 --> 00:01:30.958\nat the Bartlett School of Architecture,\n\n00:01:30.958 --> 00:01:32.958\nand we're collaborating with international scientists\n\n00:01:32.958 --> 00:01:34.958\nin order to generate these new materials\n\n00:01:34.958 --> 00:01:36.958\nfrom a bottom up approach.\n\n00:01:36.958 --> 00:01:38.958\nThat means we're generating them from scratch.\n\n00:01:38.958 --> 00:01:42.958\nOne of our collaborators is chemist Martin Hanczyc,\n\n00:01:42.958 --> 00:01:45.958\nand he's really interested in the transition from\n\n00:01:45.958 --> 00:01:47.958\ninert to living matter.\n\n00:01:47.958 --> 00:01:50.958\nNow, that's exactly the kind of process that I'm interested in,\n\n00:01:50.958 --> 00:01:52.958\nwhen we're thinking about sustainable materials.\n\n00:01:52.958 --> 00:01:57.958\nSo, Martin, he works with a system called the protocell.\n\n00:01:57.958 --> 00:02:00.958\nNow all this is -- and it's magic --\n\n00:02:00.958 --> 00:02:03.958\nis a little fatty bag. And it's got a chemical battery in it.\n\n00:02:03.958 --> 00:02:06.958\nAnd it has no DNA.\n\n00:02:06.958 --> 00:02:08.958\nThis little bag is able to conduct itself\n\n00:02:08.958 --> 00:02:11.958\nin a way that can only be described as living.\n\n00:02:11.958 --> 00:02:14.958\nIt is able to move around its environment.\n\n00:02:14.958 --> 00:02:16.958\nIt can follow chemical gradients.\n\n00:02:16.958 --> 00:02:19.958\nIt can undergo complex reactions,\n\n00:02:19.958 --> 00:02:23.958\nsome of which are happily architectural.\n\n00:02:23.958 --> 00:02:25.958\nSo here we are. These are protocells,\n\n00:02:25.958 --> 00:02:27.958\npatterning their environment.\n\n00:02:27.958 --> 00:02:30.958\nWe don't know how they do that yet.\n\n00:02:30.958 --> 00:02:34.958\nHere, this is a protocell, and it's vigorously shedding this skin.\n\n00:02:34.958 --> 00:02:36.958\nNow, this looks like a chemical kind of birth.\n\n00:02:36.958 --> 00:02:39.958\nThis is a violent process.\n\n00:02:39.958 --> 00:02:42.958\nHere, we've got a protocell to extract carbon dioxide\n\n00:02:42.958 --> 00:02:44.958\nout of the atmosphere\n\n00:02:44.958 --> 00:02:46.958\nand turn it into carbonate.\n\n00:02:46.958 --> 00:02:48.958\nAnd that's the shell around that globular fat.\n\n00:02:48.958 --> 00:02:51.958\nThey are quite brittle. So you've only got a part of one there.\n\n00:02:51.958 --> 00:02:54.958\nSo what we're trying to do is, we're trying to push these technologies\n\n00:02:54.958 --> 00:02:56.958\ntowards creating bottom-up construction approaches\n\n00:02:56.958 --> 00:02:58.958\nfor architecture,\n\n00:02:58.958 --> 00:03:01.958\nwhich contrast the current, Victorian, top-down methods\n\n00:03:01.958 --> 00:03:04.958\nwhich impose structure upon matter.\n\n00:03:04.958 --> 00:03:07.958\nThat can't be energetically sensible.\n\n00:03:07.958 --> 00:03:09.958\nSo, bottom-up materials\n\n00:03:09.958 --> 00:03:11.958\nactually exist today.\n\n00:03:11.958 --> 00:03:14.958\nThey've been in use, in architecture, since ancient times.\n\n00:03:14.958 --> 00:03:17.958\nIf you walk around the city of Oxford, where we are today,\n\n00:03:17.958 --> 00:03:19.958\nand have a look at the brickwork,\n\n00:03:19.958 --> 00:03:21.958\nwhich I've enjoyed doing in the last couple of days,\n\n00:03:21.958 --> 00:03:23.958\nyou'll actually see that a lot of it is made of limestone.\n\n00:03:23.958 --> 00:03:25.958\nAnd if you look even closer,\n\n00:03:25.958 --> 00:03:27.958\nyou'll see, in that limestone, there are little shells\n\n00:03:27.958 --> 00:03:30.958\nand little skeletons that are piled upon each other.\n\n00:03:30.958 --> 00:03:33.958\nAnd then they are fossilized over millions of years.\n\n00:03:33.958 --> 00:03:35.958\nNow a block of limestone, in itself,\n\n00:03:35.958 --> 00:03:38.958\nisn't particularly that interesting.\n\n00:03:38.958 --> 00:03:40.958\nIt looks beautiful.\n\n00:03:40.958 --> 00:03:44.958\nBut imagine what the properties of this limestone block might be\n\n00:03:44.958 --> 00:03:46.958\nif the surfaces were actually\n\n00:03:46.958 --> 00:03:49.958\nin conversation with the atmosphere.\n\n00:03:49.958 --> 00:03:52.958\nMaybe they could extract carbon dioxide.\n\n00:03:52.958 --> 00:03:55.958\nWould it give this block of limestone new properties?\n\n00:03:55.958 --> 00:03:58.958\nWell, most likely it would. It might be able to grow.\n\n00:03:58.958 --> 00:04:00.958\nIt might be able to self-repair, and even respond\n\n00:04:00.958 --> 00:04:02.958\nto dramatic changes\n\n00:04:02.958 --> 00:04:04.958\nin the immediate environment.\n\n00:04:04.958 --> 00:04:07.958\nSo, architects are never happy\n\n00:04:07.958 --> 00:04:10.958\nwith just one block of an interesting material.\n\n00:04:10.958 --> 00:04:12.958\nThey think big. Okay?\n\n00:04:12.958 --> 00:04:15.958\nSo when we think about scaling up metabolic materials,\n\n00:04:15.958 --> 00:04:17.958\nwe can start thinking about ecological interventions\n\n00:04:17.958 --> 00:04:19.958\nlike repair of atolls,\n\n00:04:19.958 --> 00:04:22.958\nor reclamation of parts of a city\n\n00:04:22.958 --> 00:04:24.958\nthat are damaged by water.\n\n00:04:24.958 --> 00:04:26.958\nSo, one of these examples\n\n00:04:26.958 --> 00:04:29.958\nwould of course be the historic city of Venice.\n\n00:04:29.958 --> 00:04:33.958\nNow, Venice, as you know, has a tempestuous relationship with the sea,\n\n00:04:33.958 --> 00:04:35.958\nand is built upon wooden piles.\n\n00:04:35.958 --> 00:04:38.958\nSo we've devised a way by which it may be possible\n\n00:04:38.958 --> 00:04:40.958\nfor the protocell technology that we're working with\n\n00:04:40.958 --> 00:04:43.958\nto sustainably reclaim Venice.\n\n00:04:43.958 --> 00:04:45.958\nAnd architect Christian Kerrigan\n\n00:04:45.958 --> 00:04:47.958\nhas come up with a series of designs that show us\n\n00:04:47.958 --> 00:04:50.958\nhow it may be possible to actually grow a limestone reef\n\n00:04:50.958 --> 00:04:52.958\nunderneath the city.\n\n00:04:52.958 --> 00:04:55.958\nSo, here is the technology we have today.\n\n00:04:55.958 --> 00:04:57.958\nThis is our protocell technology,\n\n00:04:57.958 --> 00:05:01.958\neffectively making a shell, like its limestone forefathers,\n\n00:05:01.958 --> 00:05:04.958\nand depositing it in a very complex environment,\n\n00:05:04.958 --> 00:05:06.958\nagainst natural materials.\n\n00:05:06.958 --> 00:05:09.958\nWe're looking at crystal lattices to see the bonding process in this.\n\n00:05:09.958 --> 00:05:11.958\nNow, this is the very interesting part.\n\n00:05:11.958 --> 00:05:14.958\nWe don't just want limestone dumped everywhere in all the pretty canals.\n\n00:05:14.958 --> 00:05:16.958\nWhat we need it to do is to be\n\n00:05:16.958 --> 00:05:20.958\ncreatively crafted around the wooden piles.\n\n00:05:20.958 --> 00:05:22.958\nSo, you can see from these diagrams that the protocell is actually\n\n00:05:22.958 --> 00:05:24.958\nmoving away from the light,\n\n00:05:24.958 --> 00:05:26.958\ntoward the dark foundations.\n\n00:05:26.958 --> 00:05:28.958\nWe've observed this in the laboratory.\n\n00:05:28.958 --> 00:05:31.958\nThe protocells can actually move away from the light.\n\n00:05:31.958 --> 00:05:34.958\nThey can actually also move towards the light. You have to just choose your species.\n\n00:05:34.958 --> 00:05:36.958\nSo that these don't just exist as one entity,\n\n00:05:36.958 --> 00:05:39.958\nwe kind of chemically engineer them.\n\n00:05:39.958 --> 00:05:42.958\nAnd so here the protocells are depositing their limestone\n\n00:05:42.958 --> 00:05:45.958\nvery specifically, around the foundations of Venice,\n\n00:05:45.958 --> 00:05:47.958\neffectively petrifying it.\n\n00:05:47.958 --> 00:05:51.958\nNow, this isn't going to happen tomorrow. It's going to take a while.\n\n00:05:51.958 --> 00:05:55.958\nIt's going to take years of tuning and monitoring this technology\n\n00:05:55.958 --> 00:05:57.958\nin order for us to become ready\n\n00:05:57.958 --> 00:05:59.958\nto test it out in a case-by-case basis\n\n00:05:59.958 --> 00:06:02.958\non the most damaged and stressed buildings within the city of Venice.\n\n00:06:02.958 --> 00:06:05.958\nBut gradually, as the buildings are repaired,\n\n00:06:05.958 --> 00:06:08.958\nwe will see the accretion of a limestone reef beneath the city.\n\n00:06:08.958 --> 00:06:12.958\nAn accretion itself is a huge sink of carbon dioxide.\n\n00:06:12.958 --> 00:06:15.958\nAlso it will attract the local marine ecology,\n\n00:06:15.958 --> 00:06:19.958\nwho will find their own ecological niches within this architecture.\n\n00:06:19.958 --> 00:06:22.958\nSo, this is really interesting. Now we have an architecture\n\n00:06:22.958 --> 00:06:25.958\nthat connects a city to the natural world\n\n00:06:25.958 --> 00:06:27.958\nin a very direct and immediate way.\n\n00:06:27.958 --> 00:06:30.958\nBut perhaps the most exciting thing about it\n\n00:06:30.958 --> 00:06:33.958\nis that the driver of this technology is available everywhere.\n\n00:06:33.958 --> 00:06:36.958\nThis is terrestrial chemistry. We've all got it,\n\n00:06:36.958 --> 00:06:39.958\nwhich means that this technology is just as appropriate\n\n00:06:39.958 --> 00:06:41.958\nfor developing countries as it is\n\n00:06:41.958 --> 00:06:43.958\nfor First World countries.\n\n00:06:43.958 --> 00:06:46.958\nSo, in summary, I'm generating metabolic materials\n\n00:06:46.958 --> 00:06:49.958\nas a counterpoise to Victorian technologies,\n\n00:06:49.958 --> 00:06:52.958\nand building architectures from a bottom-up approach.\n\n00:06:52.958 --> 00:06:54.958\nSecondly, these metabolic materials\n\n00:06:54.958 --> 00:06:56.958\nhave some of the properties of living systems,\n\n00:06:56.958 --> 00:06:59.958\nwhich means they can perform in similar ways.\n\n00:06:59.958 --> 00:07:02.958\nThey can expect to have a lot of forms and functions\n\n00:07:02.958 --> 00:07:04.958\nwithin the practice of architecture.\n\n00:07:04.958 --> 00:07:07.958\nAnd finally, an observer in the future\n\n00:07:07.958 --> 00:07:10.958\nmarveling at a beautiful structure in the environment\n\n00:07:10.958 --> 00:07:13.958\nmay find it almost impossible to tell\n\n00:07:13.958 --> 00:07:15.958\nwhether this structure\n\n00:07:15.958 --> 00:07:17.958\nhas been created by a natural process\n\n00:07:17.958 --> 00:07:19.958\nor an artificial one.\n\n00:07:19.958 --> 00:07:21.958\nThank you.\n\n00:07:21.958 --> 00:07:25.958\n(Applause)"}, {"title": "The year I was homeless", "duration": "429", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/becky_blanton_the_year_i_was_homeless", "transcript": "I'm a writer and a journalist, and I'm also an insanely curious person, so in 22 years as a journalist, I've learned how to do a lot of new things. And three years ago, one of the things I learned how to do was to become invisible. I became one of the working homeless. I quit my job as a newspaper editor after my father died in February of that same year, and decided to travel. His death hit me pretty hard. And there were a lot of things that I wanted to feel and deal with while I was doing that.I've camped my whole life. And I decided that living in a van for a year to do this would be like one long camping trip. So I packed my cat, my Rottweiler and my camping gear into a 1975 Chevy van, and drove off into the sunset, having fully failed to realize three critical things. One: that society equates living in a permanent structure, even a shack, with having value as a person. Two: I failed to realize how quickly the negative perceptions of other people can impact our reality, if we let it. Three: I failed to realize that homelessness is an attitude, not a lifestyle.At first, living in the van was great. I showered in campgrounds. I ate out regularly. And I had time to relax and to grieve. But then the anger and the depression about my father's death set in. My freelance job ended. And I had to get a full-time job to pay the bills. What had been a really mild spring turned into a miserably hot summer. And it became impossible to park anywhere \u2014 (Laughs) \u2014 without being very obvious that I had a cat and a dog with me, and it was really hot. The cat came and went through an open window in the van. The doggy went into doggy day care. And I sweated. Whenever I could, I used employee showers in office buildings and truck stops. Or I washed up in public rest rooms.Nighttime temperatures in the van rarely dropped below 80 degrees Fahrenheit, making it difficult or impossible to sleep. Food rotted in the heat. Ice in my ice chest melted within hours, and it was pretty miserable. I couldn't afford to find an apartment, or couldn't afford an apartment that would allow me to have the Rottweiler and the cat. And I refused to give them up, so I stayed in the van. And when the heat made me too sick to walk the 50 feet to the public restroom outside my van at night, I used a bucket and a trash bag as a toilet.When winter weather set in, the temperatures dropped below freezing. And they stayed there. And I faced a whole new set of challenges. I parked a different place every night so I would avoid being noticed and hassled by the police. I didn't always succeed.But I felt out of control of my life. And I don't know when or how it happened, but the speed at which I went from being a talented writer and journalist to being a homeless woman, living in a van, took my breath away. I hadn't changed. My I.Q. hadn't dropped. My talent, my integrity, my values, everything about me remained the same. But I had changed somehow. I spiraled deeper and deeper into a depression.And eventually someone referred me to a homeless health clinic. And I went. I hadn't bathed in three days. I was as smelly and as depressed as anyone in line. I just wasn't drunk or high. And when several of the homeless men realized that, including a former university professor, they said, \"You aren't homeless. Why are you really here?\" Other homeless people didn't see me as homeless, but I did. Then the professor listened to my story and he said, \"You have a job. You have hope. The real homeless don't have hope.\" A reaction to the medication the clinic gave me for my depression left me suicidal. And I remember thinking, \"If I killed myself, no one would notice.\"A friend told me, shortly after that, that she had heard that Tim Russert, a nationally renowned journalist, had been talking about me on national T.V. An essay I'd written about my father, the year before he died, was in Tim's new book. And he was doing the talk show circuit. And he was talking about my writing. And when I realized that Tim Russert, former moderator of \"Meet the Press,\" was talking about my writing, while I was living in a van in a Wal-Mart parking lot, I started laughing. You should too. (Laughter)I started laughing because it got to the point where, was I a writer, or was I a homeless woman? So I went in the bookstore. And I found Tim's book. And I stood there. And I reread my essay. And I cried. Because I was a writer. I was a writer. Shortly after that I moved back to Tennessee. I alternated between living in a van and couch surfing with friends. And I started writing again. By the summer of the following year I was a working journalist. I was winning awards. I was living in my own apartment. I was no longer homeless. And I was no longer invisible.Thousands of people work full and part-time jobs, and live in their cars. But society continues to stigmatize and criminalize living in your vehicle or on the streets. So the homeless, the working homeless, primarily remain invisible. But if you ever meet one, engage them, encourage them, and offer them hope. The human spirit can overcome anything if it has hope. And I'm not here to be the poster girl for the homeless. I'm not here to encourage you to give money to the next panhandler you meet. But I am here to tell you that, based on my experience, people are not where they live, where they sleep, or what their life situation is at any given time. Three years ago I was living in a van in a Wal-Mart parking lot, and today I'm speaking at TED. Hope always, always finds a way. Thank you.

And I decided\n\n00:00:47.958 --> 00:00:49.958\nthat living in a van for a year to do this\n\n00:00:49.958 --> 00:00:51.958\nwould be like one long camping trip.\n\n00:00:51.958 --> 00:00:54.958\nSo I packed my cat, my Rottweiler\n\n00:00:54.958 --> 00:00:58.958\nand my camping gear into a 1975 Chevy van,\n\n00:00:58.958 --> 00:01:00.958\nand drove off into the sunset,\n\n00:01:00.958 --> 00:01:04.958\nhaving fully failed to realize three critical things.\n\n00:01:04.958 --> 00:01:06.958\nOne: that society equates\n\n00:01:06.958 --> 00:01:10.958\nliving in a permanent structure, even a shack,\n\n00:01:10.958 --> 00:01:12.958\nwith having value as a person.\n\n00:01:12.958 --> 00:01:15.958\nTwo: I failed to realize how quickly\n\n00:01:15.958 --> 00:01:17.958\nthe negative perceptions of other people\n\n00:01:17.958 --> 00:01:20.958\ncan impact our reality, if we let it.\n\n00:01:20.958 --> 00:01:22.958\nThree: I failed to realize\n\n00:01:22.958 --> 00:01:24.958\nthat homelessness is an attitude,\n\n00:01:24.958 --> 00:01:27.958\nnot a lifestyle.\n\n00:01:27.958 --> 00:01:29.958\nAt first, living in the van was great.\n\n00:01:29.958 --> 00:01:32.958\nI showered in campgrounds. I ate out regularly.\n\n00:01:32.958 --> 00:01:36.958\nAnd I had time to relax and to grieve.\n\n00:01:36.958 --> 00:01:40.958\nBut then the anger and the depression about my father's death set in.\n\n00:01:40.958 --> 00:01:43.958\nMy freelance job ended. And I had to get a full-time job\n\n00:01:43.958 --> 00:01:45.958\nto pay the bills.\n\n00:01:45.958 --> 00:01:47.958\nWhat had been a really mild spring\n\n00:01:47.958 --> 00:01:49.958\nturned into a miserably hot summer.\n\n00:01:49.958 --> 00:01:51.958\nAnd it became impossible to park anywhere --\n\n00:01:51.958 --> 00:01:52.958\n(Laughs)\n\n00:01:52.958 --> 00:01:54.958\n-- without being very obvious\n\n00:01:54.958 --> 00:01:57.958\nthat I had a cat and a dog with me, and it was really hot.\n\n00:01:57.958 --> 00:02:00.958\nThe cat came and went through an open window in the van.\n\n00:02:00.958 --> 00:02:02.958\nThe doggy went into doggy day care.\n\n00:02:02.958 --> 00:02:04.958\nAnd I sweated.\n\n00:02:04.958 --> 00:02:06.958\nWhenever I could, I used\n\n00:02:06.958 --> 00:02:10.958\nemployee showers in office buildings and truck stops.\n\n00:02:10.958 --> 00:02:14.958\nOr I washed up in public rest rooms.\n\n00:02:14.958 --> 00:02:17.958\nNighttime temperatures in the van rarely dropped below 80 degrees Fahrenheit,\n\n00:02:17.958 --> 00:02:20.958\nmaking it difficult or impossible to sleep.\n\n00:02:20.958 --> 00:02:23.958\nFood rotted in the heat.\n\n00:02:23.958 --> 00:02:26.958\nIce in my ice chest melted within hours,\n\n00:02:26.958 --> 00:02:34.958\nand it was pretty miserable.\n\n00:02:34.958 --> 00:02:36.958\nI couldn't afford to find an apartment,\n\n00:02:36.958 --> 00:02:38.958\nor couldn't afford an apartment that would allow me\n\n00:02:38.958 --> 00:02:40.958\nto have the Rottweiler and the cat.\n\n00:02:40.958 --> 00:02:42.958\nAnd I refused to give them up,\n\n00:02:42.958 --> 00:02:48.958\nso I stayed in the van.\n\n00:02:48.958 --> 00:02:50.958\nAnd when the heat made me too sick\n\n00:02:50.958 --> 00:02:53.958\nto walk the 50 feet to the public restroom\n\n00:02:53.958 --> 00:02:55.958\noutside my van at night,\n\n00:02:55.958 --> 00:02:58.958\nI used a bucket and a trash bag as a toilet.\n\n00:02:58.958 --> 00:03:01.958\nWhen winter weather set in, the temperatures dropped\n\n00:03:01.958 --> 00:03:03.958\nbelow freezing. And they stayed there.\n\n00:03:03.958 --> 00:03:08.958\nAnd I faced a whole new set of challenges.\n\n00:03:08.958 --> 00:03:11.958\nI parked a different place every night\n\n00:03:11.958 --> 00:03:14.958\nso I would avoid being noticed and hassled by the police.\n\n00:03:14.958 --> 00:03:16.958\nI didn't always succeed.\n\n00:03:16.958 --> 00:03:23.958\nBut I felt out of control of my life.\n\n00:03:23.958 --> 00:03:27.958\nAnd I don't know when or how it happened,\n\n00:03:27.958 --> 00:03:29.958\nbut the speed at which I went\n\n00:03:29.958 --> 00:03:32.958\nfrom being a talented writer and journalist\n\n00:03:32.958 --> 00:03:35.958\nto being a homeless woman, living in a van,\n\n00:03:35.958 --> 00:03:37.958\ntook my breath away.\n\n00:03:37.958 --> 00:03:40.958\nI hadn't changed. My I.Q. hadn't dropped.\n\n00:03:40.958 --> 00:03:46.958\nMy talent, my integrity, my values,\n\n00:03:46.958 --> 00:03:49.958\neverything about me remained the same.\n\n00:03:49.958 --> 00:03:51.958\nBut I had changed somehow.\n\n00:03:51.958 --> 00:03:54.958\nI spiraled deeper and deeper into a depression.\n\n00:03:54.958 --> 00:03:57.958\nAnd eventually someone referred me to a homeless health clinic.\n\n00:03:57.958 --> 00:04:00.958\nAnd I went. I hadn't bathed in three days.\n\n00:04:00.958 --> 00:04:04.958\nI was as smelly and as depressed as anyone in line.\n\n00:04:04.958 --> 00:04:07.958\nI just wasn't drunk or high.\n\n00:04:07.958 --> 00:04:10.958\nAnd when several of the homeless men realized that,\n\n00:04:10.958 --> 00:04:12.958\nincluding a former university professor,\n\n00:04:12.958 --> 00:04:16.958\nthey said, \"You aren't homeless. Why are you really here?\"\n\n00:04:16.958 --> 00:04:18.958\nOther homeless people didn't see me as homeless,\n\n00:04:18.958 --> 00:04:21.958\nbut I did.\n\n00:04:21.958 --> 00:04:25.958\nThen the professor listened to my story and he said,\n\n00:04:25.958 --> 00:04:28.958\n\"You have a job. You have hope.\n\n00:04:28.958 --> 00:04:32.958\nThe real homeless don't have hope.\"\n\n00:04:32.958 --> 00:04:35.958\nA reaction to the medication the clinic gave me for my depression\n\n00:04:35.958 --> 00:04:37.958\nleft me suicidal. And I remember thinking,\n\n00:04:37.958 --> 00:04:42.958\n\"If I killed myself, no one would notice.\"\n\n00:04:48.958 --> 00:04:53.958\nA friend told me, shortly after that,\n\n00:04:53.958 --> 00:04:55.958\nthat she had heard that Tim Russert,\n\n00:04:55.958 --> 00:04:57.958\na nationally renowned journalist,\n\n00:04:57.958 --> 00:04:59.958\nhad been talking about me on national T.V.\n\n00:04:59.958 --> 00:05:01.958\nAn essay I'd written about my father,\n\n00:05:01.958 --> 00:05:05.958\nthe year before he died, was in Tim's new book.\n\n00:05:05.958 --> 00:05:08.958\nAnd he was doing the talk show circuit. And he was talking about my writing.\n\n00:05:08.958 --> 00:05:12.958\nAnd when I realized that Tim Russert, former moderator of \"Meet the Press,\"\n\n00:05:12.958 --> 00:05:14.958\nwas talking about my writing,\n\n00:05:14.958 --> 00:05:16.958\nwhile I was living in a van in a Wal-Mart parking lot,\n\n00:05:16.958 --> 00:05:18.958\nI started laughing.\n\n00:05:18.958 --> 00:05:20.958\nYou should too.\n\n00:05:20.958 --> 00:05:21.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:05:21.958 --> 00:05:23.958\nI started laughing\n\n00:05:23.958 --> 00:05:25.958\nbecause it got to the point where,\n\n00:05:25.958 --> 00:05:28.958\nwas I a writer, or was I a homeless woman?\n\n00:05:28.958 --> 00:05:31.958\nSo I went in the bookstore. And I found Tim's book.\n\n00:05:31.958 --> 00:05:34.958\nAnd I stood there. And I reread my essay.\n\n00:05:34.958 --> 00:05:36.958\nAnd I cried.\n\n00:05:36.958 --> 00:05:39.958\nBecause I was a writer.\n\n00:05:39.958 --> 00:05:41.958\nI was a writer.\n\n00:05:41.958 --> 00:05:44.958\nShortly after that I moved back to Tennessee.\n\n00:05:44.958 --> 00:05:47.958\nI alternated between living in a van and couch surfing with friends.\n\n00:05:47.958 --> 00:05:50.958\nAnd I started writing again.\n\n00:05:50.958 --> 00:05:53.958\nBy the summer of the following year I was a working journalist.\n\n00:05:53.958 --> 00:05:56.958\nI was winning awards. I was living in my own apartment.\n\n00:05:56.958 --> 00:05:58.958\nI was no longer homeless.\n\n00:05:58.958 --> 00:06:01.958\nAnd I was no longer invisible.\n\n00:06:01.958 --> 00:06:04.958\nThousands of people work full and part-time jobs,\n\n00:06:04.958 --> 00:06:06.958\nand live in their cars.\n\n00:06:06.958 --> 00:06:09.958\nBut society continues to stigmatize and criminalize\n\n00:06:09.958 --> 00:06:12.958\nliving in your vehicle or on the streets.\n\n00:06:12.958 --> 00:06:16.958\nSo the homeless, the working homeless, primarily remain invisible.\n\n00:06:16.958 --> 00:06:18.958\nBut if you ever meet one,\n\n00:06:18.958 --> 00:06:22.958\nengage them, encourage them, and offer them hope.\n\n00:06:22.958 --> 00:06:27.958\nThe human spirit can overcome anything if it has hope.\n\n00:06:27.958 --> 00:06:29.958\nAnd I'm not here to be the poster girl for the homeless.\n\n00:06:29.958 --> 00:06:32.958\nI'm not here to encourage you to give money to the next panhandler you meet.\n\n00:06:32.958 --> 00:06:35.958\nBut I am here to tell you that, based on my experience,\n\n00:06:35.958 --> 00:06:38.958\npeople are not where they live,\n\n00:06:38.958 --> 00:06:40.958\nwhere they sleep,\n\n00:06:40.958 --> 00:06:45.958\nor what their life situation is at any given time.\n\n00:06:45.958 --> 00:06:48.958\nThree years ago I was living in a van\n\n00:06:48.958 --> 00:06:50.958\nin a Wal-Mart parking lot,\n\n00:06:50.958 --> 00:06:53.958\nand today I'm speaking at TED.\n\n00:06:53.958 --> 00:06:58.958\nHope always, always finds a way. Thank you.\n\n00:06:58.958 --> 00:07:00.958\n(Applause)"}, {"title": "Symmetry, reality's riddle", "duration": "1099", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/marcus_du_sautoy_symmetry_reality_s_riddle", "transcript": "On the 30th of May, 1832, a gunshot was heard ringing out across the 13th arrondissement in Paris. (Gunshot) A peasant, who was walking to market that morning, ran towards where the gunshot had come from, and found a young man writhing in agony on the floor, clearly shot by a dueling wound. The young man's name was Evariste Galois. He was a well-known revolutionary in Paris at the time. Galois was taken to the local hospital where he died the next day in the arms of his brother. And the last words he said to his brother were, \"Don't cry for me, Alfred. I need all the courage I can muster to die at the age of 20.\"It wasn't, in fact, revolutionary politics for which Galois was famous. But a few years earlier, while still at school, he'd actually cracked one of the big mathematical problems at the time. And he wrote to the academicians in Paris, trying to explain his theory. But the academicians couldn't understand anything that he wrote. (Laughter) This is how he wrote most of his mathematics.So, the night before that duel, he realized this possibly is his last chance to try and explain his great breakthrough. So he stayed up the whole night, writing away, trying to explain his ideas. And as the dawn came up and he went to meet his destiny, he left this pile of papers on the table for the next generation. Maybe the fact that he stayed up all night doing mathematics was the fact that he was such a bad shot that morning and got killed.But contained inside those documents was a new language, a language to understand one of the most fundamental concepts of science \u2014 namely symmetry. Now, symmetry is almost nature's language. It helps us to understand so many different bits of the scientific world. For example, molecular structure. What crystals are possible, we can understand through the mathematics of symmetry.In microbiology you really don't want to get a symmetrical object, because they are generally rather nasty. The swine flu virus, at the moment, is a symmetrical object. And it uses the efficiency of symmetry to be able to propagate itself so well. But on a larger scale of biology, actually symmetry is very important, because it actually communicates genetic information.I've taken two pictures here and I've made them artificially symmetrical. And if I ask you which of these you find more beautiful, you're probably drawn to the lower two. Because it is hard to make symmetry. And if you can make yourself symmetrical, you're sending out a sign that you've got good genes, you've got a good upbringing and therefore you'll make a good mate. So symmetry is a language which can help to communicate genetic information.Symmetry can also help us to explain what's happening in the Large Hadron Collider in CERN. Or what's not happening in the Large Hadron Collider in CERN. To be able to make predictions about the fundamental particles we might see there, it seems that they are all facets of some strange symmetrical shape in a higher dimensional space.And I think Galileo summed up, very nicely, the power of mathematics to understand the scientific world around us. He wrote, \"The universe cannot be read until we have learnt the language and become familiar with the characters in which it is written. It is written in mathematical language, and the letters are triangles, circles and other geometric figures, without which means it is humanly impossible to comprehend a single word.\"But it's not just scientists who are interested in symmetry. Artists too love to play around with symmetry. They also have a slightly more ambiguous relationship with it. Here is Thomas Mann talking about symmetry in \"The Magic Mountain.\" He has a character describing the snowflake, and he says he \"shuddered at its perfect precision, found it deathly, the very marrow of death.\"But what artists like to do is to set up expectations of symmetry and then break them. And a beautiful example of this I found, actually, when I visited a colleague of mine in Japan, Professor Kurokawa. And he took me up to the temples in Nikko. And just after this photo was taken we walked up the stairs. And the gateway you see behind has eight columns, with beautiful symmetrical designs on them. Seven of them are exactly the same, and the eighth one is turned upside down.And I said to Professor Kurokawa, \"Wow, the architects must have really been kicking themselves when they realized that they'd made a mistake and put this one upside down.\" And he said, \"No, no, no. It was a very deliberate act.\" And he referred me to this lovely quote from the Japanese \"Essays in Idleness\" from the 14th century, in which the essayist wrote, \"In everything, uniformity is undesirable. Leaving something incomplete makes it interesting, and gives one the feeling that there is room for growth.\" Even when building the Imperial Palace, they always leave one place unfinished.But if I had to choose one building in the world to be cast out on a desert island, to live the rest of my life, being an addict of symmetry, I would probably choose the Alhambra in Granada. This is a palace celebrating symmetry. Recently I took my family \u2014 we do these rather kind of nerdy mathematical trips, which my family love. This is my son Tamer. You can see he's really enjoying our mathematical trip to the Alhambra. But I wanted to try and enrich him. I think one of the problems about school mathematics is it doesn't look at how mathematics is embedded in the world we live in. So, I wanted to open his eyes up to how much symmetry is running through the Alhambra.You see it already. Immediately you go in, the reflective symmetry in the water. But it's on the walls where all the exciting things are happening. The Moorish artists were denied the possibility to draw things with souls. So they explored a more geometric art. And so what is symmetry? The Alhambra somehow asks all of these questions. What is symmetry? When [there] are two of these walls, do they have the same symmetries? Can we say whether they discovered all of the symmetries in the Alhambra?And it was Galois who produced a language to be able to answer some of these questions. For Galois, symmetry \u2014 unlike for Thomas Mann, which was something still and deathly \u2014 for Galois, symmetry was all about motion. What can you do to a symmetrical object, move it in some way, so it looks the same as before you moved it? I like to describe it as the magic trick moves. What can you do to something? You close your eyes. I do something, put it back down again. It looks like it did before it started.So, for example, the walls in the Alhambra \u2014 I can take all of these tiles, and fix them at the yellow place, rotate them by 90 degrees, put them all back down again and they fit perfectly down there. And if you open your eyes again, you wouldn't know that they'd moved. But it's the motion that really characterizes the symmetry inside the Alhambra. But it's also about producing a language to describe this. And the power of mathematics is often to change one thing into another, to change geometry into language.So I'm going to take you through, perhaps push you a little bit mathematically \u2014 so brace yourselves \u2014 push you a little bit to understand how this language works, which enables us to capture what is symmetry. So, let's take these two symmetrical objects here. Let's take the twisted six-pointed starfish. What can I do to the starfish which makes it look the same? Well, there I rotated it by a sixth of a turn, and still it looks like it did before I started. I could rotate it by a third of a turn, or a half a turn, or put it back down on its image, or two thirds of a turn. And a fifth symmetry, I can rotate it by five sixths of a turn. And those are things that I can do to the symmetrical object that make it look like it did before I started.Now, for Galois, there was actually a sixth symmetry. Can anybody think what else I could do to this which would leave it like I did before I started? I can't flip it because I've put a little twist on it, haven't I? It's got no reflective symmetry. But what I could do is just leave it where it is, pick it up, and put it down again. And for Galois this was like the zeroth symmetry. Actually, the invention of the number zero was a very modern concept, seventh century A.D., by the Indians. It seems mad to talk about nothing. And this is the same idea. This is a symmetrical \u2014 so everything has symmetry, where you just leave it where it is.So, this object has six symmetries. And what about the triangle? Well, I can rotate by a third of a turn clockwise or a third of a turn anticlockwise. But now this has some reflectional symmetry. I can reflect it in the line through X, or the line through Y, or the line through Z. Five symmetries and then of course the zeroth symmetry where I just pick it up and leave it where it is. So both of these objects have six symmetries. Now, I'm a great believer that mathematics is not a spectator sport, and you have to do some mathematics in order to really understand it.So here is a little question for you. And I'm going to give a prize at the end of my talk for the person who gets closest to the answer. The Rubik's Cube. How many symmetries does a Rubik's Cube have? How many things can I do to this object and put it down so it still looks like a cube? Okay? So I want you to think about that problem as we go on, and count how many symmetries there are. And there will be a prize for the person who gets closest at the end.But let's go back down to symmetries that I got for these two objects. What Galois realized: it isn't just the individual symmetries, but how they interact with each other which really characterizes the symmetry of an object. If I do one magic trick move followed by another, the combination is a third magic trick move. And here we see Galois starting to develop a language to see the substance of the things unseen, the sort of abstract idea of the symmetry underlying this physical object. For example, what if I turn the starfish by a sixth of a turn, and then a third of a turn?So I've given names. The capital letters, A, B, C, D, E, F, are the names for the rotations. B, for example, rotates the little yellow dot to the B on the starfish. And so on. So what if I do B, which is a sixth of a turn, followed by C, which is a third of a turn? Well let's do that. A sixth of a turn, followed by a third of a turn, the combined effect is as if I had just rotated it by half a turn in one go. So the little table here records how the algebra of these symmetries work. I do one followed by another, the answer is it's rotation D, half a turn. What I if I did it in the other order? Would it make any difference? Let's see. Let's do the third of the turn first, and then the sixth of a turn. Of course, it doesn't make any difference. It still ends up at half a turn.And there is some symmetry here in the way the symmetries interact with each other. But this is completely different to the symmetries of the triangle. Let's see what happens if we do two symmetries with the triangle, one after the other. Let's do a rotation by a third of a turn anticlockwise, and reflect in the line through X. Well, the combined effect is as if I had just done the reflection in the line through Z to start with. Now, let's do it in a different order. Let's do the reflection in X first, followed by the rotation by a third of a turn anticlockwise. The combined effect, the triangle ends up somewhere completely different. It's as if it was reflected in the line through Y.Now it matters what order you do the operations in. And this enables us to distinguish why the symmetries of these objects \u2014 they both have six symmetries. So why shouldn't we say they have the same symmetries? But the way the symmetries interact enable us \u2014 we've now got a language to distinguish why these symmetries are fundamentally different. And you can try this when you go down to the pub, later on. Take a beer mat and rotate it by a quarter of a turn, then flip it. And then do it in the other order, and the picture will be facing in the opposite direction.Now, Galois produced some laws for how these tables \u2014 how symmetries interact. It's almost like little Sudoku tables. You don't see any symmetry twice in any row or column. And, using those rules, he was able to say that there are in fact only two objects with six symmetries. And they'll be the same as the symmetries of the triangle, or the symmetries of the six-pointed starfish. I think this is an amazing development. It's almost like the concept of number being developed for symmetry. In the front here, I've got one, two, three people sitting on one, two, three chairs. The people and the chairs are very different, but the number, the abstract idea of the number, is the same.And we can see this now: we go back to the walls in the Alhambra. Here are two very different walls, very different geometric pictures. But, using the language of Galois, we can understand that the underlying abstract symmetries of these things are actually the same. For example, let's take this beautiful wall with the triangles with a little twist on them. You can rotate them by a sixth of a turn if you ignore the colors. We're not matching up the colors. But the shapes match up if I rotate by a sixth of a turn around the point where all the triangles meet. What about the center of a triangle? I can rotate by a third of a turn around the center of the triangle, and everything matches up. And then there is an interesting place halfway along an edge, where I can rotate by 180 degrees. And all the tiles match up again. So rotate along halfway along the edge, and they all match up.Now, let's move to the very different-looking wall in the Alhambra. And we find the same symmetries here, and the same interaction. So, there was a sixth of a turn. A third of a turn where the Z pieces meet. And the half a turn is halfway between the six pointed stars. And although these walls look very different, Galois has produced a language to say that in fact the symmetries underlying these are exactly the same. And it's a symmetry we call 6-3-2.Here is another example in the Alhambra. This is a wall, a ceiling, and a floor. They all look very different. But this language allows us to say that they are representations of the same symmetrical abstract object, which we call 4-4-2. Nothing to do with football, but because of the fact that there are two places where you can rotate by a quarter of a turn, and one by half a turn.Now, this power of the language is even more, because Galois can say, \"Did the Moorish artists discover all of the possible symmetries on the walls in the Alhambra?\" And it turns out they almost did. You can prove, using Galois' language, there are actually only 17 different symmetries that you can do in the walls in the Alhambra. And they, if you try to produce a different wall with this 18th one, it will have to have the same symmetries as one of these 17.But these are things that we can see. And the power of Galois' mathematical language is it also allows us to create symmetrical objects in the unseen world, beyond the two-dimensional, three-dimensional, all the way through to the four- or five- or infinite-dimensional space. And that's where I work. I create mathematical objects, symmetrical objects, using Galois' language, in very high dimensional spaces. So I think it's a great example of things unseen, which the power of mathematical language allows you to create.So, like Galois, I stayed up all last night creating a new mathematical symmetrical object for you, and I've got a picture of it here. Well, unfortunately it isn't really a picture. If I could have my board at the side here, great, excellent. Here we are. Unfortunately, I can't show you a picture of this symmetrical object. But here is the language which describes how the symmetries interact.Now, this new symmetrical object does not have a name yet. Now, people like getting their names on things, on craters on the moon or new species of animals. So I'm going to give you the chance to get your name on a new symmetrical object which hasn't been named before. And this thing \u2014 species die away, and moons kind of get hit by meteors and explode \u2014 but this mathematical object will live forever. It will make you immortal. In order to win this symmetrical object, what you have to do is to answer the question I asked you at the beginning. How many symmetries does a Rubik's Cube have?Okay, I'm going to sort you out. Rather than you all shouting out, I want you to count how many digits there are in that number. Okay? If you've got it as a factorial, you've got to expand the factorials. Okay, now if you want to play, I want you to stand up, okay? If you think you've got an estimate for how many digits, right \u2014 we've already got one competitor here. If you all stay down he wins it automatically. Okay. Excellent. So we've got four here, five, six. Great. Excellent. That should get us going. All right.Anybody with five or less digits, you've got to sit down, because you've underestimated. Five or less digits. So, if you're in the tens of thousands you've got to sit down. 60 digits or more, you've got to sit down. You've overestimated. 20 digits or less, sit down. How many digits are there in your number? Two? So you should have sat down earlier. (Laughter) Let's have the other ones, who sat down during the 20, up again. Okay? If I told you 20 or less, stand up. Because this one. I think there were a few here. The people who just last sat down.Okay, how many digits do you have in your number? (Laughs) 21. Okay good. How many do you have in yours? 18. So it goes to this lady here. 21 is the closest. It actually has \u2014 the number of symmetries in the Rubik's cube has 25 digits. So now I need to name this object. So, what is your name? I need your surname. Symmetrical objects generally \u2014 spell it for me. G-H-E-Z No, SO2 has already been used, actually, in the mathematical language. So you can't have that one. So Ghez, there we go. That's your new symmetrical object. You are now immortal. (Applause)And if you'd like your own symmetrical object, I have a project raising money for a charity in Guatemala, where I will stay up all night and devise an object for you, for a donation to this charity to help kids get into education in Guatemala. And I think what drives me, as a mathematician, are those things which are not seen, the things that we haven't discovered. It's all the unanswered questions which make mathematics a living subject. And I will always come back to this quote from the Japanese \"Essays in Idleness\": \"In everything, uniformity is undesirable. Leaving something incomplete makes it interesting, and gives one the feeling that there is room for growth.\" Thank you.

was heard\n\n00:00:17.958 --> 00:00:20.958\nringing out across the 13th arrondissement in Paris.\n\n00:00:20.958 --> 00:00:21.958\n(Gunshot)\n\n00:00:21.958 --> 00:00:24.958\nA peasant, who was walking to market that morning,\n\n00:00:24.958 --> 00:00:26.958\nran towards where the gunshot had come from,\n\n00:00:26.958 --> 00:00:30.958\nand found a young man writhing in agony on the floor,\n\n00:00:30.958 --> 00:00:33.958\nclearly shot by a dueling wound.\n\n00:00:33.958 --> 00:00:36.958\nThe young man's name was Evariste Galois.\n\n00:00:36.958 --> 00:00:40.958\nHe was a well-known revolutionary in Paris at the time.\n\n00:00:40.958 --> 00:00:43.958\nGalois was taken to the local hospital\n\n00:00:43.958 --> 00:00:46.958\nwhere he died the next day in the arms of his brother.\n\n00:00:46.958 --> 00:00:48.958\nAnd the last words he said to his brother were,\n\n00:00:48.958 --> 00:00:50.958\n\"Don't cry for me, Alfred.\n\n00:00:50.958 --> 00:00:52.958\nI need all the courage I can muster\n\n00:00:52.958 --> 00:00:56.958\nto die at the age of 20.\"\n\n00:00:56.958 --> 00:00:58.958\nIt wasn't, in fact, revolutionary politics\n\n00:00:58.958 --> 00:01:00.958\nfor which Galois was famous.\n\n00:01:00.958 --> 00:01:03.958\nBut a few years earlier, while still at school,\n\n00:01:03.958 --> 00:01:05.958\nhe'd actually cracked one of the big mathematical\n\n00:01:05.958 --> 00:01:07.958\nproblems at the time.\n\n00:01:07.958 --> 00:01:09.958\nAnd he wrote to the academicians in Paris,\n\n00:01:09.958 --> 00:01:11.958\ntrying to explain his theory.\n\n00:01:11.958 --> 00:01:14.958\nBut the academicians couldn't understand anything that he wrote.\n\n00:01:14.958 --> 00:01:15.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:01:15.958 --> 00:01:18.958\nThis is how he wrote most of his mathematics.\n\n00:01:18.958 --> 00:01:20.958\nSo, the night before that duel, he realized\n\n00:01:20.958 --> 00:01:23.958\nthis possibly is his last chance\n\n00:01:23.958 --> 00:01:25.958\nto try and explain his great breakthrough.\n\n00:01:25.958 --> 00:01:28.958\nSo he stayed up the whole night, writing away,\n\n00:01:28.958 --> 00:01:30.958\ntrying to explain his ideas.\n\n00:01:30.958 --> 00:01:33.958\nAnd as the dawn came up and he went to meet his destiny,\n\n00:01:33.958 --> 00:01:37.958\nhe left this pile of papers on the table for the next generation.\n\n00:01:37.958 --> 00:01:40.958\nMaybe the fact that he stayed up all night doing mathematics\n\n00:01:40.958 --> 00:01:43.958\nwas the fact that he was such a bad shot that morning and got killed.\n\n00:01:43.958 --> 00:01:45.958\nBut contained inside those documents\n\n00:01:45.958 --> 00:01:48.958\nwas a new language, a language to understand\n\n00:01:48.958 --> 00:01:50.958\none of the most fundamental concepts\n\n00:01:50.958 --> 00:01:53.958\nof science -- namely symmetry.\n\n00:01:53.958 --> 00:01:55.958\nNow, symmetry is almost nature's language.\n\n00:01:55.958 --> 00:01:57.958\nIt helps us to understand so many\n\n00:01:57.958 --> 00:01:59.958\ndifferent bits of the scientific world.\n\n00:01:59.958 --> 00:02:01.958\nFor example, molecular structure.\n\n00:02:01.958 --> 00:02:03.958\nWhat crystals are possible,\n\n00:02:03.958 --> 00:02:07.958\nwe can understand through the mathematics of symmetry.\n\n00:02:07.958 --> 00:02:09.958\nIn microbiology you really don't want to get a symmetrical object,\n\n00:02:09.958 --> 00:02:11.958\nbecause they are generally rather nasty.\n\n00:02:11.958 --> 00:02:14.958\nThe swine flu virus, at the moment, is a symmetrical object.\n\n00:02:14.958 --> 00:02:16.958\nAnd it uses the efficiency of symmetry\n\n00:02:16.958 --> 00:02:20.958\nto be able to propagate itself so well.\n\n00:02:20.958 --> 00:02:23.958\nBut on a larger scale of biology, actually symmetry is very important,\n\n00:02:23.958 --> 00:02:25.958\nbecause it actually communicates genetic information.\n\n00:02:25.958 --> 00:02:29.958\nI've taken two pictures here and I've made them artificially symmetrical.\n\n00:02:29.958 --> 00:02:32.958\nAnd if I ask you which of these you find more beautiful,\n\n00:02:32.958 --> 00:02:34.958\nyou're probably drawn to the lower two.\n\n00:02:34.958 --> 00:02:37.958\nBecause it is hard to make symmetry.\n\n00:02:37.958 --> 00:02:39.958\nAnd if you can make yourself symmetrical, you're sending out a sign\n\n00:02:39.958 --> 00:02:42.958\nthat you've got good genes, you've got a good upbringing\n\n00:02:42.958 --> 00:02:44.958\nand therefore you'll make a good mate.\n\n00:02:44.958 --> 00:02:47.958\nSo symmetry is a language which can help to communicate\n\n00:02:47.958 --> 00:02:49.958\ngenetic information.\n\n00:02:49.958 --> 00:02:51.958\nSymmetry can also help us to explain\n\n00:02:51.958 --> 00:02:54.958\nwhat's happening in the Large Hadron Collider in CERN.\n\n00:02:54.958 --> 00:02:57.958\nOr what's not happening in the Large Hadron Collider in CERN.\n\n00:02:57.958 --> 00:02:59.958\nTo be able to make predictions about the fundamental particles\n\n00:02:59.958 --> 00:03:01.958\nwe might see there,\n\n00:03:01.958 --> 00:03:05.958\nit seems that they are all facets of some strange symmetrical shape\n\n00:03:05.958 --> 00:03:07.958\nin a higher dimensional space.\n\n00:03:07.958 --> 00:03:09.958\nAnd I think Galileo summed up, very nicely,\n\n00:03:09.958 --> 00:03:11.958\nthe power of mathematics\n\n00:03:11.958 --> 00:03:13.958\nto understand the scientific world around us.\n\n00:03:13.958 --> 00:03:15.958\nHe wrote, \"The universe cannot be read\n\n00:03:15.958 --> 00:03:17.958\nuntil we have learnt the language\n\n00:03:17.958 --> 00:03:20.958\nand become familiar with the characters in which it is written.\n\n00:03:20.958 --> 00:03:22.958\nIt is written in mathematical language,\n\n00:03:22.958 --> 00:03:26.958\nand the letters are triangles, circles and other geometric figures,\n\n00:03:26.958 --> 00:03:28.958\nwithout which means it is humanly impossible\n\n00:03:28.958 --> 00:03:31.958\nto comprehend a single word.\"\n\n00:03:31.958 --> 00:03:34.958\nBut it's not just scientists who are interested in symmetry.\n\n00:03:34.958 --> 00:03:37.958\nArtists too love to play around with symmetry.\n\n00:03:37.958 --> 00:03:40.958\nThey also have a slightly more ambiguous relationship with it.\n\n00:03:40.958 --> 00:03:43.958\nHere is Thomas Mann talking about symmetry in \"The Magic Mountain.\"\n\n00:03:43.958 --> 00:03:46.958\nHe has a character describing the snowflake,\n\n00:03:46.958 --> 00:03:49.958\nand he says he \"shuddered at its perfect precision,\n\n00:03:49.958 --> 00:03:52.958\nfound it deathly, the very marrow of death.\"\n\n00:03:52.958 --> 00:03:54.958\nBut what artists like to do is to set up expectations\n\n00:03:54.958 --> 00:03:56.958\nof symmetry and then break them.\n\n00:03:56.958 --> 00:03:58.958\nAnd a beautiful example of this\n\n00:03:58.958 --> 00:04:00.958\nI found, actually, when I visited a colleague of mine\n\n00:04:00.958 --> 00:04:02.958\nin Japan, Professor Kurokawa.\n\n00:04:02.958 --> 00:04:05.958\nAnd he took me up to the temples in Nikko.\n\n00:04:05.958 --> 00:04:08.958\nAnd just after this photo was taken we walked up the stairs.\n\n00:04:08.958 --> 00:04:10.958\nAnd the gateway you see behind\n\n00:04:10.958 --> 00:04:13.958\nhas eight columns, with beautiful symmetrical designs on them.\n\n00:04:13.958 --> 00:04:15.958\nSeven of them are exactly the same,\n\n00:04:15.958 --> 00:04:18.958\nand the eighth one is turned upside down.\n\n00:04:18.958 --> 00:04:20.958\nAnd I said to Professor Kurokawa,\n\n00:04:20.958 --> 00:04:22.958\n\"Wow, the architects must have really been kicking themselves\n\n00:04:22.958 --> 00:04:25.958\nwhen they realized that they'd made a mistake and put this one upside down.\"\n\n00:04:25.958 --> 00:04:28.958\nAnd he said, \"No, no, no. It was a very deliberate act.\"\n\n00:04:28.958 --> 00:04:30.958\nAnd he referred me to this lovely quote from the Japanese\n\n00:04:30.958 --> 00:04:33.958\n\"Essays in Idleness\" from the 14th century,\n\n00:04:33.958 --> 00:04:35.958\nin which the essayist wrote, \"In everything,\n\n00:04:35.958 --> 00:04:38.958\nuniformity is undesirable.\n\n00:04:38.958 --> 00:04:40.958\nLeaving something incomplete makes it interesting,\n\n00:04:40.958 --> 00:04:43.958\nand gives one the feeling that there is room for growth.\"\n\n00:04:43.958 --> 00:04:45.958\nEven when building the Imperial Palace,\n\n00:04:45.958 --> 00:04:49.958\nthey always leave one place unfinished.\n\n00:04:49.958 --> 00:04:52.958\nBut if I had to choose one building in the world\n\n00:04:52.958 --> 00:04:55.958\nto be cast out on a desert island, to live the rest of my life,\n\n00:04:55.958 --> 00:04:59.958\nbeing an addict of symmetry, I would probably choose the Alhambra in Granada.\n\n00:04:59.958 --> 00:05:01.958\nThis is a palace celebrating symmetry.\n\n00:05:01.958 --> 00:05:03.958\nRecently I took my family --\n\n00:05:03.958 --> 00:05:06.958\nwe do these rather kind of nerdy mathematical trips, which my family love.\n\n00:05:06.958 --> 00:05:08.958\nThis is my son Tamer. You can see\n\n00:05:08.958 --> 00:05:11.958\nhe's really enjoying our mathematical trip to the Alhambra.\n\n00:05:11.958 --> 00:05:14.958\nBut I wanted to try and enrich him.\n\n00:05:14.958 --> 00:05:16.958\nI think one of the problems about school mathematics\n\n00:05:16.958 --> 00:05:18.958\nis it doesn't look at how mathematics is embedded\n\n00:05:18.958 --> 00:05:20.958\nin the world we live in.\n\n00:05:20.958 --> 00:05:22.958\nSo, I wanted to open his eyes up to\n\n00:05:22.958 --> 00:05:25.958\nhow much symmetry is running through the Alhambra.\n\n00:05:25.958 --> 00:05:27.958\nYou see it already. Immediately you go in,\n\n00:05:27.958 --> 00:05:29.958\nthe reflective symmetry in the water.\n\n00:05:29.958 --> 00:05:32.958\nBut it's on the walls where all the exciting things are happening.\n\n00:05:32.958 --> 00:05:34.958\nThe Moorish artists were denied the possibility\n\n00:05:34.958 --> 00:05:36.958\nto draw things with souls.\n\n00:05:36.958 --> 00:05:38.958\nSo they explored a more geometric art.\n\n00:05:38.958 --> 00:05:40.958\nAnd so what is symmetry?\n\n00:05:40.958 --> 00:05:43.958\nThe Alhambra somehow asks all of these questions.\n\n00:05:43.958 --> 00:05:45.958\nWhat is symmetry? When [there] are two of these walls,\n\n00:05:45.958 --> 00:05:47.958\ndo they have the same symmetries?\n\n00:05:47.958 --> 00:05:49.958\nCan we say whether they discovered\n\n00:05:49.958 --> 00:05:52.958\nall of the symmetries in the Alhambra?\n\n00:05:52.958 --> 00:05:54.958\nAnd it was Galois who produced a language\n\n00:05:54.958 --> 00:05:57.958\nto be able to answer some of these questions.\n\n00:05:57.958 --> 00:06:00.958\nFor Galois, symmetry -- unlike for Thomas Mann,\n\n00:06:00.958 --> 00:06:02.958\nwhich was something still and deathly --\n\n00:06:02.958 --> 00:06:05.958\nfor Galois, symmetry was all about motion.\n\n00:06:05.958 --> 00:06:07.958\nWhat can you do to a symmetrical object,\n\n00:06:07.958 --> 00:06:09.958\nmove it in some way, so it looks the same\n\n00:06:09.958 --> 00:06:11.958\nas before you moved it?\n\n00:06:11.958 --> 00:06:13.958\nI like to describe it as the magic trick moves.\n\n00:06:13.958 --> 00:06:15.958\nWhat can you do to something? You close your eyes.\n\n00:06:15.958 --> 00:06:17.958\nI do something, put it back down again.\n\n00:06:17.958 --> 00:06:19.958\nIt looks like it did before it started.\n\n00:06:19.958 --> 00:06:21.958\nSo, for example, the walls in the Alhambra --\n\n00:06:21.958 --> 00:06:25.958\nI can take all of these tiles, and fix them at the yellow place,\n\n00:06:25.958 --> 00:06:27.958\nrotate them by 90 degrees,\n\n00:06:27.958 --> 00:06:30.958\nput them all back down again and they fit perfectly down there.\n\n00:06:30.958 --> 00:06:33.958\nAnd if you open your eyes again, you wouldn't know that they'd moved.\n\n00:06:33.958 --> 00:06:36.958\nBut it's the motion that really characterizes the symmetry\n\n00:06:36.958 --> 00:06:38.958\ninside the Alhambra.\n\n00:06:38.958 --> 00:06:40.958\nBut it's also about producing a language to describe this.\n\n00:06:40.958 --> 00:06:43.958\nAnd the power of mathematics is often\n\n00:06:43.958 --> 00:06:47.958\nto change one thing into another, to change geometry into language.\n\n00:06:47.958 --> 00:06:50.958\nSo I'm going to take you through, perhaps push you a little bit mathematically --\n\n00:06:50.958 --> 00:06:52.958\nso brace yourselves --\n\n00:06:52.958 --> 00:06:55.958\npush you a little bit to understand how this language works,\n\n00:06:55.958 --> 00:06:57.958\nwhich enables us to capture what is symmetry.\n\n00:06:57.958 --> 00:07:00.958\nSo, let's take these two symmetrical objects here.\n\n00:07:00.958 --> 00:07:02.958\nLet's take the twisted six-pointed starfish.\n\n00:07:02.958 --> 00:07:05.958\nWhat can I do to the starfish which makes it look the same?\n\n00:07:05.958 --> 00:07:08.958\nWell, there I rotated it by a sixth of a turn,\n\n00:07:08.958 --> 00:07:10.958\nand still it looks like it did before I started.\n\n00:07:10.958 --> 00:07:13.958\nI could rotate it by a third of a turn,\n\n00:07:13.958 --> 00:07:15.958\nor a half a turn,\n\n00:07:15.958 --> 00:07:18.958\nor put it back down on its image, or two thirds of a turn.\n\n00:07:18.958 --> 00:07:22.958\nAnd a fifth symmetry, I can rotate it by five sixths of a turn.\n\n00:07:22.958 --> 00:07:25.958\nAnd those are things that I can do to the symmetrical object\n\n00:07:25.958 --> 00:07:28.958\nthat make it look like it did before I started.\n\n00:07:28.958 --> 00:07:31.958\nNow, for Galois, there was actually a sixth symmetry.\n\n00:07:31.958 --> 00:07:33.958\nCan anybody think what else I could do to this\n\n00:07:33.958 --> 00:07:36.958\nwhich would leave it like I did before I started?\n\n00:07:36.958 --> 00:07:39.958\nI can't flip it because I've put a little twist on it, haven't I?\n\n00:07:39.958 --> 00:07:41.958\nIt's got no reflective symmetry.\n\n00:07:41.958 --> 00:07:44.958\nBut what I could do is just leave it where it is,\n\n00:07:44.958 --> 00:07:46.958\npick it up, and put it down again.\n\n00:07:46.958 --> 00:07:49.958\nAnd for Galois this was like the zeroth symmetry.\n\n00:07:49.958 --> 00:07:52.958\nActually, the invention of the number zero\n\n00:07:52.958 --> 00:07:55.958\nwas a very modern concept, seventh century A.D., by the Indians.\n\n00:07:55.958 --> 00:07:58.958\nIt seems mad to talk about nothing.\n\n00:07:58.958 --> 00:08:00.958\nAnd this is the same idea. This is a symmetrical --\n\n00:08:00.958 --> 00:08:02.958\nso everything has symmetry, where you just leave it where it is.\n\n00:08:02.958 --> 00:08:05.958\nSo, this object has six symmetries.\n\n00:08:05.958 --> 00:08:07.958\nAnd what about the triangle?\n\n00:08:07.958 --> 00:08:11.958\nWell, I can rotate by a third of a turn clockwise\n\n00:08:11.958 --> 00:08:13.958\nor a third of a turn anticlockwise.\n\n00:08:13.958 --> 00:08:15.958\nBut now this has some reflectional symmetry.\n\n00:08:15.958 --> 00:08:17.958\nI can reflect it in the line through X,\n\n00:08:17.958 --> 00:08:19.958\nor the line through Y,\n\n00:08:19.958 --> 00:08:21.958\nor the line through Z.\n\n00:08:21.958 --> 00:08:24.958\nFive symmetries and then of course the zeroth symmetry\n\n00:08:24.958 --> 00:08:27.958\nwhere I just pick it up and leave it where it is.\n\n00:08:27.958 --> 00:08:30.958\nSo both of these objects have six symmetries.\n\n00:08:30.958 --> 00:08:33.958\nNow, I'm a great believer that mathematics is not a spectator sport,\n\n00:08:33.958 --> 00:08:35.958\nand you have to do some mathematics\n\n00:08:35.958 --> 00:08:37.958\nin order to really understand it.\n\n00:08:37.958 --> 00:08:39.958\nSo here is a little question for you.\n\n00:08:39.958 --> 00:08:41.958\nAnd I'm going to give a prize at the end of my talk\n\n00:08:41.958 --> 00:08:43.958\nfor the person who gets closest to the answer.\n\n00:08:43.958 --> 00:08:45.958\nThe Rubik's Cube.\n\n00:08:45.958 --> 00:08:48.958\nHow many symmetries does a Rubik's Cube have?\n\n00:08:48.958 --> 00:08:50.958\nHow many things can I do to this object\n\n00:08:50.958 --> 00:08:52.958\nand put it down so it still looks like a cube?\n\n00:08:52.958 --> 00:08:55.958\nOkay? So I want you to think about that problem as we go on,\n\n00:08:55.958 --> 00:08:57.958\nand count how many symmetries there are.\n\n00:08:57.958 --> 00:09:01.958\nAnd there will be a prize for the person who gets closest at the end.\n\n00:09:01.958 --> 00:09:05.958\nBut let's go back down to symmetries that I got for these two objects.\n\n00:09:05.958 --> 00:09:08.958\nWhat Galois realized: it isn't just the individual symmetries,\n\n00:09:08.958 --> 00:09:10.958\nbut how they interact with each other\n\n00:09:10.958 --> 00:09:14.958\nwhich really characterizes the symmetry of an object.\n\n00:09:14.958 --> 00:09:17.958\nIf I do one magic trick move followed by another,\n\n00:09:17.958 --> 00:09:19.958\nthe combination is a third magic trick move.\n\n00:09:19.958 --> 00:09:21.958\nAnd here we see Galois starting to develop\n\n00:09:21.958 --> 00:09:24.958\na language to see the substance\n\n00:09:24.958 --> 00:09:26.958\nof the things unseen, the sort of abstract idea\n\n00:09:26.958 --> 00:09:29.958\nof the symmetry underlying this physical object.\n\n00:09:29.958 --> 00:09:32.958\nFor example, what if I turn the starfish\n\n00:09:32.958 --> 00:09:34.958\nby a sixth of a turn,\n\n00:09:34.958 --> 00:09:36.958\nand then a third of a turn?\n\n00:09:36.958 --> 00:09:39.958\nSo I've given names. The capital letters, A, B, C, D, E, F,\n\n00:09:39.958 --> 00:09:41.958\nare the names for the rotations.\n\n00:09:41.958 --> 00:09:44.958\nB, for example, rotates the little yellow dot\n\n00:09:44.958 --> 00:09:47.958\nto the B on the starfish. And so on.\n\n00:09:47.958 --> 00:09:49.958\nSo what if I do B, which is a sixth of a turn,\n\n00:09:49.958 --> 00:09:52.958\nfollowed by C, which is a third of a turn?\n\n00:09:52.958 --> 00:09:54.958\nWell let's do that. A sixth of a turn,\n\n00:09:54.958 --> 00:09:56.958\nfollowed by a third of a turn,\n\n00:09:56.958 --> 00:10:01.958\nthe combined effect is as if I had just rotated it by half a turn in one go.\n\n00:10:01.958 --> 00:10:03.958\nSo the little table here records\n\n00:10:03.958 --> 00:10:06.958\nhow the algebra of these symmetries work.\n\n00:10:06.958 --> 00:10:08.958\nI do one followed by another, the answer is\n\n00:10:08.958 --> 00:10:10.958\nit's rotation D, half a turn.\n\n00:10:10.958 --> 00:10:13.958\nWhat I if I did it in the other order? Would it make any difference?\n\n00:10:13.958 --> 00:10:17.958\nLet's see. Let's do the third of the turn first, and then the sixth of a turn.\n\n00:10:17.958 --> 00:10:19.958\nOf course, it doesn't make any difference.\n\n00:10:19.958 --> 00:10:21.958\nIt still ends up at half a turn.\n\n00:10:21.958 --> 00:10:26.958\nAnd there is some symmetry here in the way the symmetries interact with each other.\n\n00:10:26.958 --> 00:10:29.958\nBut this is completely different to the symmetries of the triangle.\n\n00:10:29.958 --> 00:10:31.958\nLet's see what happens if we do two symmetries\n\n00:10:31.958 --> 00:10:33.958\nwith the triangle, one after the other.\n\n00:10:33.958 --> 00:10:36.958\nLet's do a rotation by a third of a turn anticlockwise,\n\n00:10:36.958 --> 00:10:38.958\nand reflect in the line through X.\n\n00:10:38.958 --> 00:10:42.958\nWell, the combined effect is as if I had just done the reflection in the line through Z\n\n00:10:42.958 --> 00:10:44.958\nto start with.\n\n00:10:44.958 --> 00:10:46.958\nNow, let's do it in a different order.\n\n00:10:46.958 --> 00:10:48.958\nLet's do the reflection in X first,\n\n00:10:48.958 --> 00:10:52.958\nfollowed by the rotation by a third of a turn anticlockwise.\n\n00:10:52.958 --> 00:10:55.958\nThe combined effect, the triangle ends up somewhere completely different.\n\n00:10:55.958 --> 00:10:58.958\nIt's as if it was reflected in the line through Y.\n\n00:10:58.958 --> 00:11:01.958\nNow it matters what order you do the operations in.\n\n00:11:01.958 --> 00:11:03.958\nAnd this enables us to distinguish\n\n00:11:03.958 --> 00:11:05.958\nwhy the symmetries of these objects --\n\n00:11:05.958 --> 00:11:07.958\nthey both have six symmetries. So why shouldn't we say\n\n00:11:07.958 --> 00:11:09.958\nthey have the same symmetries?\n\n00:11:09.958 --> 00:11:11.958\nBut the way the symmetries interact\n\n00:11:11.958 --> 00:11:13.958\nenable us -- we've now got a language\n\n00:11:13.958 --> 00:11:16.958\nto distinguish why these symmetries are fundamentally different.\n\n00:11:16.958 --> 00:11:19.958\nAnd you can try this when you go down to the pub, later on.\n\n00:11:19.958 --> 00:11:22.958\nTake a beer mat and rotate it by a quarter of a turn,\n\n00:11:22.958 --> 00:11:24.958\nthen flip it. And then do it in the other order,\n\n00:11:24.958 --> 00:11:28.958\nand the picture will be facing in the opposite direction.\n\n00:11:28.958 --> 00:11:32.958\nNow, Galois produced some laws for how these tables -- how symmetries interact.\n\n00:11:32.958 --> 00:11:34.958\nIt's almost like little Sudoku tables.\n\n00:11:34.958 --> 00:11:36.958\nYou don't see any symmetry twice\n\n00:11:36.958 --> 00:11:38.958\nin any row or column.\n\n00:11:38.958 --> 00:11:42.958\nAnd, using those rules, he was able to say\n\n00:11:42.958 --> 00:11:44.958\nthat there are in fact only two objects\n\n00:11:44.958 --> 00:11:46.958\nwith six symmetries.\n\n00:11:46.958 --> 00:11:49.958\nAnd they'll be the same as the symmetries of the triangle,\n\n00:11:49.958 --> 00:11:51.958\nor the symmetries of the six-pointed starfish.\n\n00:11:51.958 --> 00:11:53.958\nI think this is an amazing development.\n\n00:11:53.958 --> 00:11:57.958\nIt's almost like the concept of number being developed for symmetry.\n\n00:11:57.958 --> 00:11:59.958\nIn the front here, I've got one, two, three people\n\n00:11:59.958 --> 00:12:01.958\nsitting on one, two, three chairs.\n\n00:12:01.958 --> 00:12:04.958\nThe people and the chairs are very different,\n\n00:12:04.958 --> 00:12:07.958\nbut the number, the abstract idea of the number, is the same.\n\n00:12:07.958 --> 00:12:10.958\nAnd we can see this now: we go back to the walls in the Alhambra.\n\n00:12:10.958 --> 00:12:12.958\nHere are two very different walls,\n\n00:12:12.958 --> 00:12:14.958\nvery different geometric pictures.\n\n00:12:14.958 --> 00:12:16.958\nBut, using the language of Galois,\n\n00:12:16.958 --> 00:12:19.958\nwe can understand that the underlying abstract symmetries of these things\n\n00:12:19.958 --> 00:12:21.958\nare actually the same.\n\n00:12:21.958 --> 00:12:23.958\nFor example, let's take this beautiful wall\n\n00:12:23.958 --> 00:12:26.958\nwith the triangles with a little twist on them.\n\n00:12:26.958 --> 00:12:28.958\nYou can rotate them by a sixth of a turn\n\n00:12:28.958 --> 00:12:30.958\nif you ignore the colors. We're not matching up the colors.\n\n00:12:30.958 --> 00:12:33.958\nBut the shapes match up if I rotate by a sixth of a turn\n\n00:12:33.958 --> 00:12:36.958\naround the point where all the triangles meet.\n\n00:12:36.958 --> 00:12:38.958\nWhat about the center of a triangle? I can rotate\n\n00:12:38.958 --> 00:12:40.958\nby a third of a turn around the center of the triangle,\n\n00:12:40.958 --> 00:12:42.958\nand everything matches up.\n\n00:12:42.958 --> 00:12:44.958\nAnd then there is an interesting place halfway along an edge,\n\n00:12:44.958 --> 00:12:46.958\nwhere I can rotate by 180 degrees.\n\n00:12:46.958 --> 00:12:49.958\nAnd all the tiles match up again.\n\n00:12:49.958 --> 00:12:52.958\nSo rotate along halfway along the edge, and they all match up.\n\n00:12:52.958 --> 00:12:56.958\nNow, let's move to the very different-looking wall in the Alhambra.\n\n00:12:56.958 --> 00:12:59.958\nAnd we find the same symmetries here, and the same interaction.\n\n00:12:59.958 --> 00:13:04.958\nSo, there was a sixth of a turn. A third of a turn where the Z pieces meet.\n\n00:13:04.958 --> 00:13:08.958\nAnd the half a turn is halfway between the six pointed stars.\n\n00:13:08.958 --> 00:13:10.958\nAnd although these walls look very different,\n\n00:13:10.958 --> 00:13:13.958\nGalois has produced a language to say\n\n00:13:13.958 --> 00:13:16.958\nthat in fact the symmetries underlying these are exactly the same.\n\n00:13:16.958 --> 00:13:19.958\nAnd it's a symmetry we call 6-3-2.\n\n00:13:19.958 --> 00:13:21.958\nHere is another example in the Alhambra.\n\n00:13:21.958 --> 00:13:24.958\nThis is a wall, a ceiling, and a floor.\n\n00:13:24.958 --> 00:13:27.958\nThey all look very different. But this language allows us to say\n\n00:13:27.958 --> 00:13:31.958\nthat they are representations of the same symmetrical abstract object,\n\n00:13:31.958 --> 00:13:33.958\nwhich we call 4-4-2. Nothing to do with football,\n\n00:13:33.958 --> 00:13:36.958\nbut because of the fact that there are two places where you can rotate\n\n00:13:36.958 --> 00:13:40.958\nby a quarter of a turn, and one by half a turn.\n\n00:13:40.958 --> 00:13:42.958\nNow, this power of the language is even more,\n\n00:13:42.958 --> 00:13:44.958\nbecause Galois can say,\n\n00:13:44.958 --> 00:13:47.958\n\"Did the Moorish artists discover all of the possible symmetries\n\n00:13:47.958 --> 00:13:49.958\non the walls in the Alhambra?\"\n\n00:13:49.958 --> 00:13:51.958\nAnd it turns out they almost did.\n\n00:13:51.958 --> 00:13:53.958\nYou can prove, using Galois' language,\n\n00:13:53.958 --> 00:13:55.958\nthere are actually only 17\n\n00:13:55.958 --> 00:13:59.958\ndifferent symmetries that you can do in the walls in the Alhambra.\n\n00:13:59.958 --> 00:14:02.958\nAnd they, if you try to produce a different wall with this 18th one,\n\n00:14:02.958 --> 00:14:07.958\nit will have to have the same symmetries as one of these 17.\n\n00:14:07.958 --> 00:14:09.958\nBut these are things that we can see.\n\n00:14:09.958 --> 00:14:11.958\nAnd the power of Galois' mathematical language\n\n00:14:11.958 --> 00:14:13.958\nis it also allows us to create\n\n00:14:13.958 --> 00:14:16.958\nsymmetrical objects in the unseen world,\n\n00:14:16.958 --> 00:14:18.958\nbeyond the two-dimensional, three-dimensional,\n\n00:14:18.958 --> 00:14:21.958\nall the way through to the four- or five- or infinite-dimensional space.\n\n00:14:21.958 --> 00:14:23.958\nAnd that's where I work. I create\n\n00:14:23.958 --> 00:14:25.958\nmathematical objects, symmetrical objects,\n\n00:14:25.958 --> 00:14:27.958\nusing Galois' language,\n\n00:14:27.958 --> 00:14:29.958\nin very high dimensional spaces.\n\n00:14:29.958 --> 00:14:31.958\nSo I think it's a great example of things unseen,\n\n00:14:31.958 --> 00:14:35.958\nwhich the power of mathematical language allows you to create.\n\n00:14:35.958 --> 00:14:37.958\nSo, like Galois, I stayed up all last night\n\n00:14:37.958 --> 00:14:41.958\ncreating a new mathematical symmetrical object for you,\n\n00:14:41.958 --> 00:14:43.958\nand I've got a picture of it here.\n\n00:14:43.958 --> 00:14:46.958\nWell, unfortunately it isn't really a picture. If I could have my board\n\n00:14:46.958 --> 00:14:48.958\nat the side here, great, excellent.\n\n00:14:48.958 --> 00:14:50.958\nHere we are. Unfortunately, I can't show you\n\n00:14:50.958 --> 00:14:52.958\na picture of this symmetrical object.\n\n00:14:52.958 --> 00:14:55.958\nBut here is the language which describes\n\n00:14:55.958 --> 00:14:57.958\nhow the symmetries interact.\n\n00:14:57.958 --> 00:14:59.958\nNow, this new symmetrical object\n\n00:14:59.958 --> 00:15:01.958\ndoes not have a name yet.\n\n00:15:01.958 --> 00:15:03.958\nNow, people like getting their names on things,\n\n00:15:03.958 --> 00:15:05.958\non craters on the moon\n\n00:15:05.958 --> 00:15:07.958\nor new species of animals.\n\n00:15:07.958 --> 00:15:11.958\nSo I'm going to give you the chance to get your name on a new symmetrical object\n\n00:15:11.958 --> 00:15:13.958\nwhich hasn't been named before.\n\n00:15:13.958 --> 00:15:15.958\nAnd this thing -- species die away,\n\n00:15:15.958 --> 00:15:18.958\nand moons kind of get hit by meteors and explode --\n\n00:15:18.958 --> 00:15:20.958\nbut this mathematical object will live forever.\n\n00:15:20.958 --> 00:15:22.958\nIt will make you immortal.\n\n00:15:22.958 --> 00:15:25.958\nIn order to win this symmetrical object,\n\n00:15:25.958 --> 00:15:28.958\nwhat you have to do is to answer the question I asked you at the beginning.\n\n00:15:28.958 --> 00:15:32.958\nHow many symmetries does a Rubik's Cube have?\n\n00:15:32.958 --> 00:15:34.958\nOkay, I'm going to sort you out.\n\n00:15:34.958 --> 00:15:37.958\nRather than you all shouting out, I want you to count how many digits there are\n\n00:15:37.958 --> 00:15:39.958\nin that number. Okay?\n\n00:15:39.958 --> 00:15:42.958\nIf you've got it as a factorial, you've got to expand the factorials.\n\n00:15:42.958 --> 00:15:44.958\nOkay, now if you want to play,\n\n00:15:44.958 --> 00:15:46.958\nI want you to stand up, okay?\n\n00:15:46.958 --> 00:15:48.958\nIf you think you've got an estimate for how many digits,\n\n00:15:48.958 --> 00:15:51.958\nright -- we've already got one competitor here.\n\n00:15:51.958 --> 00:15:53.958\nIf you all stay down he wins it automatically.\n\n00:15:53.958 --> 00:15:56.958\nOkay. Excellent. So we've got four here, five, six.\n\n00:15:56.958 --> 00:16:01.958\nGreat. Excellent. That should get us going. All right.\n\n00:16:01.958 --> 00:16:04.958\nAnybody with five or less digits, you've got to sit down,\n\n00:16:04.958 --> 00:16:06.958\nbecause you've underestimated.\n\n00:16:06.958 --> 00:16:10.958\nFive or less digits. So, if you're in the tens of thousands you've got to sit down.\n\n00:16:10.958 --> 00:16:13.958\n60 digits or more, you've got to sit down.\n\n00:16:13.958 --> 00:16:15.958\nYou've overestimated.\n\n00:16:15.958 --> 00:16:19.958\n20 digits or less, sit down.\n\n00:16:19.958 --> 00:16:24.958\nHow many digits are there in your number?\n\n00:16:24.958 --> 00:16:26.958\nTwo? So you should have sat down earlier.\n\n00:16:26.958 --> 00:16:27.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:16:27.958 --> 00:16:31.958\nLet's have the other ones, who sat down during the 20, up again. Okay?\n\n00:16:31.958 --> 00:16:33.958\nIf I told you 20 or less, stand up.\n\n00:16:33.958 --> 00:16:35.958\nBecause this one. I think there were a few here.\n\n00:16:35.958 --> 00:16:38.958\nThe people who just last sat down.\n\n00:16:38.958 --> 00:16:43.958\nOkay, how many digits do you have in your number?\n\n00:16:43.958 --> 00:16:46.958\n(Laughs)\n\n00:16:46.958 --> 00:16:48.958\n21. Okay good. How many do you have in yours?\n\n00:16:48.958 --> 00:16:51.958\n18. So it goes to this lady here.\n\n00:16:51.958 --> 00:16:53.958\n21 is the closest.\n\n00:16:53.958 --> 00:16:55.958\nIt actually has -- the number of symmetries in the Rubik's cube\n\n00:16:55.958 --> 00:16:57.958\nhas 25 digits.\n\n00:16:57.958 --> 00:16:59.958\nSo now I need to name this object.\n\n00:16:59.958 --> 00:17:01.958\nSo, what is your name?\n\n00:17:01.958 --> 00:17:04.958\nI need your surname. Symmetrical objects generally --\n\n00:17:04.958 --> 00:17:06.958\nspell it for me.\n\n00:17:06.958 --> 00:17:13.958\nG-H-E-Z\n\n00:17:13.958 --> 00:17:15.958\nNo, SO2 has already been used, actually,\n\n00:17:15.958 --> 00:17:17.958\nin the mathematical language. So you can't have that one.\n\n00:17:17.958 --> 00:17:19.958\nSo Ghez, there we go. That's your new symmetrical object.\n\n00:17:19.958 --> 00:17:21.958\nYou are now immortal.\n\n00:17:21.958 --> 00:17:27.958\n(Applause)\n\n00:17:27.958 --> 00:17:29.958\nAnd if you'd like your own symmetrical object,\n\n00:17:29.958 --> 00:17:32.958\nI have a project raising money for a charity in Guatemala,\n\n00:17:32.958 --> 00:17:35.958\nwhere I will stay up all night and devise an object for you,\n\n00:17:35.958 --> 00:17:39.958\nfor a donation to this charity to help kids get into education in Guatemala.\n\n00:17:39.958 --> 00:17:42.958\nAnd I think what drives me, as a mathematician,\n\n00:17:42.958 --> 00:17:46.958\nare those things which are not seen, the things that we haven't discovered.\n\n00:17:46.958 --> 00:17:50.958\nIt's all the unanswered questions which make mathematics a living subject.\n\n00:17:50.958 --> 00:17:53.958\nAnd I will always come back to this quote from the Japanese \"Essays in Idleness\":\n\n00:17:53.958 --> 00:17:56.958\n\"In everything, uniformity is undesirable.\n\n00:17:56.958 --> 00:17:59.958\nLeaving something incomplete makes it interesting,\n\n00:17:59.958 --> 00:18:02.958\nand gives one the feeling that there is room for growth.\" Thank you.\n\n00:18:02.958 --> 00:18:09.958\n(Applause)"}, {"title": "How the Internet enables intimacy", "duration": "531", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/stefana_broadbent_how_the_internet_enables_intimacy", "transcript": "I believe that there are new, hidden tensions that are actually happening between people and institutions \u2014 institutions that are the institutions that people inhabit in their daily life: schools, hospitals, workplaces, factories, offices, etc. And something that I see happening is something that I would like to call a sort of \"democratization of intimacy.\" And what do I mean by that? I mean that what people are doing is, in fact, they are sort of, with their communication channels, they are breaking an imposed isolation that these institutions are imposing on them. How are they doing this? They're doing it in a very simple way, by calling their mom from work, by IMing from their office to their friends, by texting under the desk. The pictures that you're seeing behind me are people that I visited in the last few months. And I asked them to come along with the person they communicate with most. And somebody brought a boyfriend, somebody a father. One young woman brought her grandfather. For 20 years, I've been looking at how people use channels such as email, the mobile phone, texting, etc. What we're actually going to see is that, fundamentally, people are communicating on a regular basis with five, six, seven of their most intimate sphere. Now, lets take some data. Facebook. Recently some sociologists from Facebook \u2014 Facebook is the channel that you would expect is the most enlargening of all channels. And an average user, said Cameron Marlow, from Facebook, has about 120 friends. But he actually talks to, has two-way exchanges with, about four to six people on a regular base, depending on his gender. Academic research on instant messaging also shows 100 people on buddy lists, but fundamentally people chat with two, three, four \u2014 anyway, less than five. My own research on cellphones and voice calls shows that 80 percent of the calls are actually made to four people. 80 percent. And when you go to Skype, it's down to two people. A lot of sociologists actually are quite disappointed. I mean, I've been a bit disappointed sometimes when I saw this data and all this deployment, just for five people. And some sociologists actually feel that it's a closure, it's a cocooning, that we're disengaging from the public. And I would actually, I would like to show you that if we actually look at who is doing it, and from where they're doing it, actually there is an incredible social transformation. There are three stories that I think are quite good examples. The first gentleman, he's a baker. And so he starts working every morning at four o'clock in the morning. And around eight o'clock he sort of sneaks away from his oven, cleans his hands from the flour and calls his wife. He just wants to wish her a good day, because that's the start of her day. And I've heard this story a number of times. A young factory worker who works night shifts, who manages to sneak away from the factory floor, where there is CCTV by the way, and find a corner, where at 11 o'clock at night he can call his girlfriend and just say goodnight. Or a mother who, at four o'clock, suddenly manages to find a corner in the toilet to check that her children are safely home. Then there is another couple, there is a Brazilian couple. They've lived in Italy for a number of years. They Skype with their families a few times a week. But once a fortnight, they actually put the computer on their dining table, pull out the webcam and actually have dinner with their family in Sao Paulo. And they have a big event of it. And I heard this story the first time a couple of years ago from a very modest family of immigrants from Kosovo in Switzerland. They had set up a big screen in their living room, and every morning they had breakfast with their grandmother. But Danny Miller, who is a very good anthropologist who is working on Filipina migrant women who leave their children back in the Philippines, was telling me about how much parenting is going on through Skype, and how much these mothers are engaged with their children through Skype. And then there is the third couple. They are two friends. They chat to each other every day, a few times a day actually. And finally, finally, they've managed to put instant messaging on their computers at work. And now, obviously, they have it open. Whenever they have a moment they chat to each other. And this is exactly what we've been seeing with teenagers and kids doing it in school, under the table, and texting under the table to their friends. So, none of these cases are unique. I mean, I could tell you hundreds of them. But what is really exceptional is the setting. So, think of the three settings I've talked to you about: factory, migration, office. But it could be in a school, it could be an administration, it could be a hospital. Three settings that, if we just step back 15 years, if you just think back 15 years, when you clocked in, when you clocked in to an office, when you clocked in to a factory, there was no contact for the whole duration of the time, there was no contact with your private sphere. If you were lucky there was a public phone hanging in the corridor or somewhere. If you were in management, oh, that was a different story. Maybe you had a direct line. If you were not, you maybe had to go through an operator. But basically, when you walked into those buildings, the private sphere was left behind you. And this has become such a norm of our professional lives, such a norm and such an expectation. And it had nothing to do with technical capability. The phones were there. But the expectation was once you moved in there your commitment was fully to the task at hand, fully to the people around you. That was where the focus had to be. And this has become such a cultural norm that we actually school our children for them to be capable to do this cleavage. If you think nursery, kindergarten, first years of school are just dedicated to take away the children, to make them used to staying long hours away from their family. And then the school enacts perfectly well. It mimics perfectly all the rituals that we will find in offices: rituals of entry, rituals of exit, the schedules, the uniforms in this country, things that identify you, team-building activities, team building that will allow you to basically be with a random group of kids, or a random group of people that you will have to be with for a number of time. And of course, the major thing: learn to pay attention, to concentrate and focus your attention. This only started about 150 years ago. It only started with the birth of modern bureaucracy, and of industrial revolution. When people basically had to go somewhere else to work and carry out the work. And when with modern bureaucracy there was a very rational approach, where there was a clear distinction between the private sphere and the public sphere. So, until then, basically people were living on top of their trades. They were living on top of the land they were laboring. They were living on top of the workshops where they were working. And if you think, it's permeated our whole culture, even our cities. If you think of medieval cities, medieval cities the boroughs all have the names of the guilds and professions that lived there. Now we have sprawling residential suburbias that are well distinct from production areas and commercial areas. And actually, over these 150 years, there has been a very clear class system that also has emerged. So the lower the status of the job and of the person carrying out, the more removed he would be from his personal sphere. People have taken this amazing possibility of actually being in contact all through the day or in all types of situations. And they are doing it massively. The Pew Institute, which produces good data on a regular basis on, for instance, in the States, says that \u2014 and I think that this number is conservative \u2014 50 percent of anybody with email access at work is actually doing private email from his office. I really think that the number is conservative. In my own research, we saw that the peak for private email is actually 11 o'clock in the morning, whatever the country. 75 percent of people admit doing private conversations from work on their mobile phones. 100 percent are using text. The point is that this re-appropriation of the personal sphere is not terribly successful with all institutions. I'm always surprised the U.S. Army sociologists are discussing of the impact for instance, of soldiers in Iraq having daily contact with their families. But there are many institutions that are actually blocking this access. And every day, every single day, I read news that makes me cringe, like a $15 fine to kids in Texas, for using, every time they take out their mobile phone in school. Immediate dismissal to bus drivers in New York, if seen with a mobile phone in a hand. Companies blocking access to IM or to Facebook. Behind issues of security and safety, which have always been the arguments for social control, in fact what is going on is that these institutions are trying to decide who, in fact, has a right to self determine their attention, to decide, whether they should, or not, be isolated. And they are actually trying to block, in a certain sense, this movement of a greater possibility of intimacy.", "id": 680, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:11.958 --> 00:00:15.958\nI believe that there are new, hidden tensions\n\n00:00:15.958 --> 00:00:18.958\nthat are actually happening between people and institutions --\n\n00:00:18.958 --> 00:00:20.958\ninstitutions that are the institutions that people\n\n00:00:20.958 --> 00:00:22.958\ninhabit in their daily life:\n\n00:00:22.958 --> 00:00:25.958\nschools, hospitals, workplaces,\n\n00:00:25.958 --> 00:00:28.958\nfactories, offices, etc.\n\n00:00:28.958 --> 00:00:31.958\nAnd something that I see happening\n\n00:00:31.958 --> 00:00:33.958\nis something that I would like to call\n\n00:00:33.958 --> 00:00:35.958\na sort of \"democratization of intimacy.\"\n\n00:00:35.958 --> 00:00:37.958\nAnd what do I mean by that?\n\n00:00:37.958 --> 00:00:39.958\nI mean that what people are doing\n\n00:00:39.958 --> 00:00:43.958\nis, in fact, they are sort of, with their communication channels,\n\n00:00:43.958 --> 00:00:47.958\nthey are breaking an imposed isolation\n\n00:00:47.958 --> 00:00:51.958\nthat these institutions are imposing on them.\n\n00:00:51.958 --> 00:00:53.958\nHow are they doing this? They're doing it\n\n00:00:53.958 --> 00:00:55.958\nin a very simple way, by calling their mom from work,\n\n00:00:55.958 --> 00:00:59.958\nby IMing from their office to their friends,\n\n00:00:59.958 --> 00:01:01.958\nby texting under the desk.\n\n00:01:01.958 --> 00:01:03.958\nThe pictures that you're seeing behind me\n\n00:01:03.958 --> 00:01:06.958\nare people that I visited in the last few months.\n\n00:01:06.958 --> 00:01:10.958\nAnd I asked them to come along with the person they communicate with most.\n\n00:01:10.958 --> 00:01:13.958\nAnd somebody brought a boyfriend, somebody a father.\n\n00:01:13.958 --> 00:01:16.958\nOne young woman brought her grandfather.\n\n00:01:16.958 --> 00:01:18.958\nFor 20 years, I've been looking at how people use\n\n00:01:18.958 --> 00:01:22.958\nchannels such as email, the mobile phone, texting, etc.\n\n00:01:22.958 --> 00:01:24.958\nWhat we're actually going to see is that, fundamentally,\n\n00:01:24.958 --> 00:01:27.958\npeople are communicating on a regular basis\n\n00:01:27.958 --> 00:01:31.958\nwith five, six, seven of their most intimate sphere.\n\n00:01:31.958 --> 00:01:33.958\nNow, lets take some data. Facebook.\n\n00:01:33.958 --> 00:01:35.958\nRecently some sociologists from Facebook --\n\n00:01:35.958 --> 00:01:37.958\nFacebook is the channel that you would expect\n\n00:01:37.958 --> 00:01:40.958\nis the most enlargening of all channels.\n\n00:01:40.958 --> 00:01:42.958\nAnd an average user,\n\n00:01:42.958 --> 00:01:45.958\nsaid Cameron Marlow,\n\n00:01:45.958 --> 00:01:48.958\nfrom Facebook, has about 120 friends.\n\n00:01:48.958 --> 00:01:50.958\nBut he actually talks to,\n\n00:01:50.958 --> 00:01:53.958\nhas two-way exchanges with, about four to six people\n\n00:01:53.958 --> 00:01:55.958\non a regular base, depending on his gender.\n\n00:01:55.958 --> 00:01:57.958\nAcademic research on instant messaging\n\n00:01:57.958 --> 00:02:00.958\nalso shows 100 people on buddy lists,\n\n00:02:00.958 --> 00:02:03.958\nbut fundamentally people chat with two, three, four --\n\n00:02:03.958 --> 00:02:05.958\nanyway, less than five.\n\n00:02:05.958 --> 00:02:09.958\nMy own research on cellphones and voice calls\n\n00:02:09.958 --> 00:02:11.958\nshows that 80 percent of the calls\n\n00:02:11.958 --> 00:02:14.958\nare actually made to four people. 80 percent.\n\n00:02:14.958 --> 00:02:17.958\nAnd when you go to Skype, it's down to two people.\n\n00:02:17.958 --> 00:02:19.958\nA lot of sociologists actually are quite disappointed.\n\n00:02:19.958 --> 00:02:22.958\nI mean, I've been a bit disappointed sometimes\n\n00:02:22.958 --> 00:02:26.958\nwhen I saw this data and all this deployment, just for five people.\n\n00:02:26.958 --> 00:02:28.958\nAnd some sociologists actually feel that\n\n00:02:28.958 --> 00:02:33.958\nit's a closure, it's a cocooning,\n\n00:02:33.958 --> 00:02:35.958\nthat we're disengaging from the public.\n\n00:02:35.958 --> 00:02:37.958\nAnd I would actually, I would like to show you that\n\n00:02:37.958 --> 00:02:39.958\nif we actually look at who is doing it,\n\n00:02:39.958 --> 00:02:41.958\nand from where they're doing it,\n\n00:02:41.958 --> 00:02:44.958\nactually there is an incredible social transformation.\n\n00:02:44.958 --> 00:02:46.958\nThere are three stories that I think are quite good examples.\n\n00:02:46.958 --> 00:02:48.958\nThe first gentleman, he's a baker.\n\n00:02:48.958 --> 00:02:51.958\nAnd so he starts working every morning at four o'clock in the morning.\n\n00:02:51.958 --> 00:02:54.958\nAnd around eight o'clock he sort of sneaks away from his oven,\n\n00:02:54.958 --> 00:02:56.958\ncleans his hands from the flour\n\n00:02:56.958 --> 00:02:58.958\nand calls his wife.\n\n00:02:58.958 --> 00:03:01.958\nHe just wants to wish her a good day, because that's the start of her day.\n\n00:03:01.958 --> 00:03:04.958\nAnd I've heard this story a number of times.\n\n00:03:04.958 --> 00:03:07.958\nA young factory worker who works night shifts,\n\n00:03:07.958 --> 00:03:10.958\nwho manages to sneak away from the factory floor,\n\n00:03:10.958 --> 00:03:12.958\nwhere there is CCTV by the way,\n\n00:03:12.958 --> 00:03:14.958\nand find a corner, where at 11 o'clock at night\n\n00:03:14.958 --> 00:03:17.958\nhe can call his girlfriend and just say goodnight.\n\n00:03:17.958 --> 00:03:19.958\nOr a mother who, at four o'clock,\n\n00:03:19.958 --> 00:03:22.958\nsuddenly manages to find a corner in the toilet\n\n00:03:22.958 --> 00:03:26.958\nto check that her children are safely home.\n\n00:03:26.958 --> 00:03:28.958\nThen there is another couple, there is a Brazilian couple.\n\n00:03:28.958 --> 00:03:30.958\nThey've lived in Italy for a number of years.\n\n00:03:30.958 --> 00:03:33.958\nThey Skype with their families a few times a week.\n\n00:03:33.958 --> 00:03:37.958\nBut once a fortnight, they actually put the computer on their dining table,\n\n00:03:37.958 --> 00:03:39.958\npull out the webcam and actually have dinner\n\n00:03:39.958 --> 00:03:42.958\nwith their family in Sao Paulo. And they have a big event of it.\n\n00:03:42.958 --> 00:03:45.958\nAnd I heard this story the first time a couple of years ago\n\n00:03:45.958 --> 00:03:47.958\nfrom a very modest family\n\n00:03:47.958 --> 00:03:50.958\nof immigrants from Kosovo in Switzerland.\n\n00:03:50.958 --> 00:03:53.958\nThey had set up a big screen in their living room,\n\n00:03:53.958 --> 00:03:56.958\nand every morning they had breakfast with their grandmother.\n\n00:03:56.958 --> 00:03:59.958\nBut Danny Miller, who is a very good anthropologist\n\n00:03:59.958 --> 00:04:04.958\nwho is working on Filipina migrant women\n\n00:04:04.958 --> 00:04:07.958\nwho leave their children back in the Philippines,\n\n00:04:07.958 --> 00:04:10.958\nwas telling me about how much parenting is going on\n\n00:04:10.958 --> 00:04:12.958\nthrough Skype,\n\n00:04:12.958 --> 00:04:16.958\nand how much these mothers are engaged with their children through Skype.\n\n00:04:16.958 --> 00:04:19.958\nAnd then there is the third couple. They are two friends.\n\n00:04:19.958 --> 00:04:23.958\nThey chat to each other every day, a few times a day actually.\n\n00:04:23.958 --> 00:04:25.958\nAnd finally, finally, they've managed to put\n\n00:04:25.958 --> 00:04:27.958\ninstant messaging on their computers at work.\n\n00:04:27.958 --> 00:04:29.958\nAnd now, obviously, they have it open.\n\n00:04:29.958 --> 00:04:31.958\nWhenever they have a moment they chat to each other.\n\n00:04:31.958 --> 00:04:33.958\nAnd this is exactly what we've been seeing\n\n00:04:33.958 --> 00:04:36.958\nwith teenagers and kids doing it in school, under the table,\n\n00:04:36.958 --> 00:04:39.958\nand texting under the table to their friends.\n\n00:04:39.958 --> 00:04:41.958\nSo, none of these cases are unique.\n\n00:04:41.958 --> 00:04:43.958\nI mean, I could tell you hundreds of them.\n\n00:04:43.958 --> 00:04:46.958\nBut what is really exceptional is the setting.\n\n00:04:46.958 --> 00:04:49.958\nSo, think of the three settings I've talked to you about:\n\n00:04:49.958 --> 00:04:52.958\nfactory, migration, office.\n\n00:04:52.958 --> 00:04:55.958\nBut it could be in a school, it could be an administration,\n\n00:04:55.958 --> 00:04:57.958\nit could be a hospital.\n\n00:04:57.958 --> 00:04:59.958\nThree settings that, if we just step back 15 years,\n\n00:04:59.958 --> 00:05:02.958\nif you just think back 15 years,\n\n00:05:02.958 --> 00:05:04.958\nwhen you clocked in,\n\n00:05:04.958 --> 00:05:06.958\nwhen you clocked in to an office,\n\n00:05:06.958 --> 00:05:08.958\nwhen you clocked in to a factory,\n\n00:05:08.958 --> 00:05:11.958\nthere was no contact for the whole duration of the time,\n\n00:05:11.958 --> 00:05:14.958\nthere was no contact with your private sphere.\n\n00:05:14.958 --> 00:05:18.958\nIf you were lucky there was a public phone hanging in the corridor or somewhere.\n\n00:05:18.958 --> 00:05:21.958\nIf you were in management, oh, that was a different story.\n\n00:05:21.958 --> 00:05:23.958\nMaybe you had a direct line.\n\n00:05:23.958 --> 00:05:26.958\nIf you were not, you maybe had to go through an operator.\n\n00:05:26.958 --> 00:05:29.958\nBut basically, when you walked into those buildings,\n\n00:05:29.958 --> 00:05:32.958\nthe private sphere was left behind you.\n\n00:05:32.958 --> 00:05:37.958\nAnd this has become such a norm of our professional lives,\n\n00:05:37.958 --> 00:05:39.958\nsuch a norm and such an expectation.\n\n00:05:39.958 --> 00:05:42.958\nAnd it had nothing to do with technical capability.\n\n00:05:42.958 --> 00:05:45.958\nThe phones were there. But the expectation was once you moved in there\n\n00:05:45.958 --> 00:05:48.958\nyour commitment was fully to the task at hand,\n\n00:05:48.958 --> 00:05:51.958\nfully to the people around you.\n\n00:05:51.958 --> 00:05:53.958\nThat was where the focus had to be.\n\n00:05:53.958 --> 00:05:56.958\nAnd this has become such a cultural norm\n\n00:05:56.958 --> 00:06:00.958\nthat we actually school our children for them to be capable to do this cleavage.\n\n00:06:00.958 --> 00:06:02.958\nIf you think nursery, kindergarten, first years of school\n\n00:06:02.958 --> 00:06:05.958\nare just dedicated to take away the children,\n\n00:06:05.958 --> 00:06:09.958\nto make them used to staying long hours away from their family.\n\n00:06:09.958 --> 00:06:11.958\nAnd then the school enacts perfectly well.\n\n00:06:11.958 --> 00:06:14.958\nIt mimics perfectly all the rituals that we will find in offices:\n\n00:06:14.958 --> 00:06:17.958\nrituals of entry, rituals of exit,\n\n00:06:17.958 --> 00:06:21.958\nthe schedules, the uniforms in this country,\n\n00:06:21.958 --> 00:06:24.958\nthings that identify you, team-building activities,\n\n00:06:24.958 --> 00:06:27.958\nteam building that will allow you to basically\n\n00:06:27.958 --> 00:06:30.958\nbe with a random group of kids, or a random group of people\n\n00:06:30.958 --> 00:06:33.958\nthat you will have to be with for a number of time.\n\n00:06:33.958 --> 00:06:35.958\nAnd of course, the major thing:\n\n00:06:35.958 --> 00:06:37.958\nlearn to pay attention,\n\n00:06:37.958 --> 00:06:40.958\nto concentrate and focus your attention.\n\n00:06:40.958 --> 00:06:42.958\nThis only started about 150 years ago.\n\n00:06:42.958 --> 00:06:45.958\nIt only started with the birth of modern bureaucracy,\n\n00:06:45.958 --> 00:06:47.958\nand of industrial revolution.\n\n00:06:47.958 --> 00:06:50.958\nWhen people basically had to go somewhere else to work\n\n00:06:50.958 --> 00:06:52.958\nand carry out the work.\n\n00:06:52.958 --> 00:06:55.958\nAnd when with modern bureaucracy there was a very rational approach,\n\n00:06:55.958 --> 00:06:57.958\nwhere there was a clear distinction between the private sphere\n\n00:06:57.958 --> 00:06:59.958\nand the public sphere.\n\n00:06:59.958 --> 00:07:03.958\nSo, until then, basically people were living on top of their trades.\n\n00:07:03.958 --> 00:07:06.958\nThey were living on top of the land they were laboring.\n\n00:07:06.958 --> 00:07:09.958\nThey were living on top of the workshops where they were working.\n\n00:07:09.958 --> 00:07:11.958\nAnd if you think, it's permeated our whole culture,\n\n00:07:11.958 --> 00:07:13.958\neven our cities.\n\n00:07:13.958 --> 00:07:16.958\nIf you think of medieval cities, medieval cities the boroughs\n\n00:07:16.958 --> 00:07:19.958\nall have the names of the guilds and professions that lived there.\n\n00:07:19.958 --> 00:07:22.958\nNow we have sprawling residential suburbias\n\n00:07:22.958 --> 00:07:25.958\nthat are well distinct from production areas\n\n00:07:25.958 --> 00:07:28.958\nand commercial areas.\n\n00:07:28.958 --> 00:07:30.958\nAnd actually, over these 150 years,\n\n00:07:30.958 --> 00:07:33.958\nthere has been a very clear class system that also has emerged.\n\n00:07:33.958 --> 00:07:37.958\nSo the lower the status of the job\n\n00:07:37.958 --> 00:07:39.958\nand of the person carrying out, the more removed\n\n00:07:39.958 --> 00:07:42.958\nhe would be from his personal sphere.\n\n00:07:42.958 --> 00:07:45.958\nPeople have taken this amazing possibility\n\n00:07:45.958 --> 00:07:47.958\nof actually being in contact all through the day\n\n00:07:47.958 --> 00:07:49.958\nor in all types of situations.\n\n00:07:49.958 --> 00:07:51.958\nAnd they are doing it massively.\n\n00:07:51.958 --> 00:07:53.958\nThe Pew Institute, which produces good data\n\n00:07:53.958 --> 00:07:56.958\non a regular basis on, for instance, in the States,\n\n00:07:56.958 --> 00:07:58.958\nsays that -- and I think that this number is conservative --\n\n00:07:58.958 --> 00:08:02.958\n50 percent of anybody with email access at work\n\n00:08:02.958 --> 00:08:05.958\nis actually doing private email from his office.\n\n00:08:05.958 --> 00:08:09.958\nI really think that the number is conservative.\n\n00:08:09.958 --> 00:08:11.958\nIn my own research, we saw that the peak for private email\n\n00:08:11.958 --> 00:08:15.958\nis actually 11 o'clock in the morning, whatever the country.\n\n00:08:15.958 --> 00:08:18.958\n75 percent of people admit doing private\n\n00:08:18.958 --> 00:08:21.958\nconversations from work on their mobile phones.\n\n00:08:21.958 --> 00:08:24.958\n100 percent are using text.\n\n00:08:24.958 --> 00:08:28.958\nThe point is that this re-appropriation of the personal sphere\n\n00:08:28.958 --> 00:08:31.958\nis not terribly successful with all institutions.\n\n00:08:31.958 --> 00:08:33.958\nI'm always surprised the U.S. Army\n\n00:08:33.958 --> 00:08:35.958\nsociologists are discussing of the impact\n\n00:08:35.958 --> 00:08:37.958\nfor instance, of soldiers in Iraq\n\n00:08:37.958 --> 00:08:40.958\nhaving daily contact with their families.\n\n00:08:40.958 --> 00:08:46.958\nBut there are many institutions that are actually blocking this access.\n\n00:08:46.958 --> 00:08:48.958\nAnd every day, every single day,\n\n00:08:48.958 --> 00:08:50.958\nI read news that makes me cringe,\n\n00:08:50.958 --> 00:08:52.958\nlike a $15

In 2006, young Qatari students took me to go and see the migrant worker camps. And since then I've followed the unfolding issue of worker rights.In the last six months, more than 300 skyscrapers in the UAE have been put on hold or canceled. Behind the headlines that lay behind these buildings is the fate of the often-indentured construction worker. 1.1 million of them. Mainly Indian, Pakistani, Sri Lankan and Nepalese, these laborers risk everything to make money for their families back home. They pay a middle-man thousands of dollars to be there. And when they arrive, they find themselves in labor camps with no water, no air conditioning, and their passports taken away.While it's easy to point the finger at local officials and higher authorities, 99 percent of these people are hired by the private sector, and so therefore we're equally, if not more, accountable. Groups like Buildsafe UAE have emerged, but the numbers are simply overwhelming. In August 2008, UAE public officials noted that 40 percent of the country's 1,098 labor camps had violated minimum health and fire safety regulations. And last summer, more than 10,000 workers protested for the non-payment of wages, for the poor quality of food, and inadequate housing.And then the financial collapse happened. When the contractors have gone bust, as they've been overleveraged like everyone else, the difference is everything goes missing, documentation, passports, and tickets home for these workers. Currently, right now, thousands of workers are abandoned. There is no way back home. And there is no way, and no proof of arrival. These are the boom-and-bust refugees.The question is, as a building professional, as an architect, an engineer, as a developer, if you know this is going on, as we go to the sights every single week, are you complacent or complicit in the human rights violations? So let's forget your environmental footprint. Let's think about your ethical footprint. What good is it to build a zero-carbon, energy efficient complex, when the labor producing this architectural gem is unethical at best? Now, recently I've been told I've been taking the high road. But, quite frankly, on this issue, there is no other road.So let's not forget who is really paying the price of this financial collapse. And that as we worry about our next job in the office, the next design that we can get, to keep our workers. Let's not forget these men, who are truly dying to work. Thank you.

Headlines that look like this when they have to do with climate change; and like this when they have to do with air quality or smog. They're two branches of the same field of atmospheric science.Recently, the headlines looked like this when the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, or IPCC, put out their report on the state of understanding of the atmospheric system. That report was written by 620 scientists from 40 countries. They wrote almost 1,000 pages on the topic, and all of those pages were reviewed by another 400-plus scientists and reviewers from 113 countries. It's a big community; such a big community, in fact, that our annual gathering is the largest scientific meeting in the world.Over 15,000 scientists go to San Francisco every year for that. Every one of those scientists is in a research group, and every research group studies a wide variety of topics. For us at Cambridge, it's as varied as the El Ni\u00f1o Oscillation, which affects weather and climate, to the assimilation of satellite data, to emissions from crops that produce biofuels, which is what I study.And in each one of these research areas, of which there are even more, there are PhD students, like me, and we study incredibly narrow topics, things as narrow as a few processes or a few molecules. And one of the molecules I study is called isoprene, which is here. It's a small organic molecule. You've probably never heard of it. The weight of a paper clip is approximately equal to 900 zeta-illion \u2014 10 to the 21st \u2014 molecules of isoprene.But despite its very small weight, enough of it is emitted into the atmosphere every year to equal the weight of all the people on the planet. It's a huge amount of stuff. It's equal to the weight of methane. And because it's so much stuff, it's really important for the atmospheric system.Because it's important to the atmospheric system, we go to all lengths to study this thing. We blow it up and look at the pieces. This is the EUPHORE Smog Chamber in Spain. Atmospheric explosions, or full combustion, takes about 15,000 times longer than what happens in your car. But still, we look at the pieces.We run enormous models on supercomputers; this is what I happen to do. Our models have hundreds of thousands of grid boxes calculating hundreds of variables each, on minute timescales. It takes weeks to perform our integrations, and we perform dozens of integrations in order to understand what's happening.We also fly all over the world looking for this thing. I recently joined a field campaign in Malaysia \u2014 there are others. We found a global atmospheric watchtower there in the middle of the rainforest, and hung hundreds of thousands of dollars' worth of scientific equipment off this tower, to look for isoprene and other things while we were there. This is the tower in the middle of the rainforest from above, and the tower from below.On part of that field campaign we even brought an aircraft with us. And this plane, the model BAe-146, which was run by FAAM, normally flies 120 to 130 people, so maybe you took a similar aircraft to get here today. But we didn't just fly it. We were flying at 100 meters above the top of the canopy to measure this molecule \u2014 incredibly dangerous stuff.We have to fly at a special incline to make the measurements; we hire military and test pilots to do the maneuvering; we need special flight clearance. As you come around the banks in these valleys, the forces can get up to two Gs; the scientists must be completely harnessed in in order to make measurements while on board. So as you can imagine, the inside of the aircraft doesn't look like one you'd take on vacation. It's a flying laboratory we took to make measurements of this molecule.We do all this to understand the chemistry of one molecule. And when one student like me has some sort of inclination or understanding about that molecule, they write one scientific paper on the subject. And out of that field campaign we'll probably get a few dozen papers on a few dozen processes or molecules.As a body of knowledge builds up, it will form one subsection, or one sub-subsection, of an assessment like the IPCC, although we have others. And each one of the 11 chapters of the IPCC has six to ten subsections. So you can imagine the scale of the effort. In each one of the assessments we write, we always tag on a summary, and the summary is written for a non-scientific audience. And we hand that summary to journalists and policy makers in order to make headlines like these.Thank you very much.(Applause)", "id": 682, "subtitle":

And I worked in mines. And I realized that this was a world unseen. And I wanted, through color and large format cameras and very large prints, to make a body of work that somehow became symbols of our use of the landscape, how we use the land. And to me this was a key component that somehow, through this medium of photography, which allows us to contemplate these landscapes, that I thought photography was perfectly suited to doing this type of work.And after 17 years of photographing large industrial landscapes, it occurred to me that oil is underpinning the scale and speed. Because that is what has changed, is the speed at which we're taking all our resources. And so then I went out to develop a whole series on the landscape of oil. And what I want to do is to kind of map an arc that there is extraction, where we're taking it from the ground, refinement. And that's one chapter.The other chapter that I wanted to look at was how we use it \u2014 our cities, our cars, our motorcultures, where people gather around the vehicle as a celebration. And then the third one is this idea of the end of oil, this entropic end, where all of our parts of cars, our tires, oil filters, helicopters, planes \u2014 where are the landscapes where all of that stuff ends up?And to me, again, photography was a way in which I could explore and research the world, and find those places. And another idea that I had as well, that was brought forward by an ecologist \u2014 he basically did a calculation where he took one liter of gas and said, well, how much carbon it would take, and how much organic material? It was 23 metric tons for one liter. So whenever I fill up my gas, I think of that liter, and how much carbon.And I know that oil comes from the ocean and phytoplankton, but he did the calculations for our Earth and what it had to do to produce that amount of energy. From the photosynthetic growth, it would take 500 years of that growth to produce what we use, the 30 billion barrels we use per year.And that also brought me to the fact that this poses such a risk to our society. Looking at 30 billion per year, we look at our two largest suppliers, Saudi Arabia and now Canada, with its dirty oil. And together they only form about 15 years of supply. The whole world, at 1.2 trillion estimated reserves, only gives us about 45 years. So, it's not a question of if, but a question of when peak oil will come upon us.So, to me, using photography \u2014 and I feel that all of us need to now begin to really take the task of using our talents, our ways of thinking, to begin to deal with what I think is probably one of the most challenging issues of our time, how to deal with our energy crisis.And I would like to say that, on the other side of it, 30, 40 years from now, the children that I have, I can look at them and say, \"We did everything we possibly, humanly could do, to begin to mitigate this, what I feel is one of the most important and critical moments in our time.

Well, you probably recognize the first person. I'm sure you're all avid \"American Idol\" watchers. But you might not recognize Aydah Al Jahani, who is a contestant, indeed a finalist, in the Poet of the Millions competition, which is broadcast out of Abu Dhabi, and seen throughout the Arab world. In this contest people have to write and recite original poetry, in the Nabati form of poetry, which is the traditional Bedouin form. And Lima Sahar was a finalist in the Afghan Star singing competition.Now, before I go any further, yes, I know it all began with \"Britain's Got Talent.\" But my point in discussing this is to show you \u2014 I hope I'll be able to show you how these merit-based competitions, with equal access to everyone, with the winner selected via voting by SMS, are changing tribal societies. And I'm going to focus on Afghanistan and the Arab world with the UAE, how they're changing tribal societies, not by introducing Western ideas, but by being integrated into the language in those places.It all begins with enjoyment. Video: We are late to watch \"Afghan Star.\" We are going to watch \"Afghan Star.\" We are late. We are running late. We must go to watch \"Afghan Star.\" Cynthia Schneider: These programs are reaching incredibly deeply into society. In Afghanistan, people go to extraordinary lengths to be able to watch this program. And you don't necessarily have to have your own TV set. People watch it all over the country also in public places. But it goes beyond watching, because also, part of this is campaigning. People become so engaged that they have volunteers, just like political volunteers anyway, who fan out over the countryside, campaigning for their candidate. Contestants also put themselves forward.Now, of course there is a certain degree of ethnic allegiance, but not entirely. Because each year the winner has come from a different tribal group. This has opened up the door, particularly for women. And in the last season there were two women in the finalists. One of them, Lima Sahar, is a Pashtun from Kandahar, a very conservative part of the country. And here she relates, in the documentary film \"Afghan Star,\" how her friends urged her not to do this and told her that she was leaving them for democracy. But she also confides that she knows that members of the Taliban are actually SMS-ing votes in for her.Aydah Al Jahnani also took risks and put herself out, to compete in the Poet of the Millions competition. I have to say, her husband backed her from the start. But her tribe and family urged her not to compete and were very much against it. But, once she started to win, then they got behind her again. It turns out that competition and winning is a universal human value. And she's out there. Her poetry is about women, and the life of women in society. So just by presenting herself and being in competition with men \u2014 this shows the voting on the program \u2014 it sets a very important example for young women \u2014 these are young women in the audience of the program \u2014 in Abu Dhabi, but also people in the viewing audience.Now you'd think that \"American Idol\" would introduce a measure of Americanization. But actually, just the opposite is happening. By using this engaging popular format for traditional, local culture, it actually, in the Gulf, is precipitating a revival of interest in Nabati poetry, also in traditional dress and dance and music. And for Afghanistan, where the Taliban banned music for many years, it is reintroducing their traditional music. They don't sing pop songs, they sing Afghan music. And they also have learned how to lose gracefully, without avenging the winner. (Laughter) No small thing.And the final, sort of, formulation of this \"American Idol\" format, which has just appeared in Afghanistan, is a new program called \"The Candidate.\" And in this program, people present policy platforms that are then voted on. Many of them are too young to run for president, but by putting the issues out there, they are influencing the presidential race. So for me, the substance of things unseen is how reality TV is driving reality. Thank you.

00:02:49.958\nAnd in the last season there were two women in the finalists.\n\n00:02:49.958 --> 00:02:52.958\nOne of them, Lima Sahar, is a Pashtun from Kandahar,\n\n00:02:52.958 --> 00:02:55.958\na very conservative part of the country.\n\n00:02:55.958 --> 00:02:59.958\nAnd here she relates, in the documentary film \"Afghan Star,\"\n\n00:02:59.958 --> 00:03:02.958\nhow her friends urged her not to do this\n\n00:03:02.958 --> 00:03:05.958\nand told her that she was leaving them for democracy.\n\n00:03:05.958 --> 00:03:08.958\nBut she also confides that\n\n00:03:08.958 --> 00:03:10.958\nshe knows that members of the Taliban\n\n00:03:10.958 --> 00:03:15.958\nare actually SMS-ing votes in for her.\n\n00:03:15.958 --> 00:03:18.958\nAydah Al Jahnani also took risks\n\n00:03:18.958 --> 00:03:20.958\nand put herself out, to compete\n\n00:03:20.958 --> 00:03:23.958\nin the Poet of the Millions competition.\n\n00:03:23.958 --> 00:03:27.958\nI have to say, her husband backed her from the start.\n\n00:03:27.958 --> 00:03:30.958\nBut her tribe and family urged her not to compete\n\n00:03:30.958 --> 00:03:32.958\nand were very much against it.\n\n00:03:32.958 --> 00:03:35.958\nBut, once she started to win,\n\n00:03:35.958 --> 00:03:37.958\nthen they got behind her again.\n\n00:03:37.958 --> 00:03:43.958\nIt turns out that competition and winning is a universal human value.\n\n00:03:43.958 --> 00:03:45.958\nAnd she's out there.\n\n00:03:45.958 --> 00:03:48.958\nHer poetry is about women,\n\n00:03:48.958 --> 00:03:51.958\nand the life of women in society.\n\n00:03:51.958 --> 00:03:53.958\nSo just by presenting herself\n\n00:03:53.958 --> 00:03:55.958\nand being in competition with men --\n\n00:03:55.958 --> 00:03:57.958\nthis shows the voting on the program --\n\n00:03:57.958 --> 00:04:00.958\nit sets a very important example for young women --\n\n00:04:00.958 --> 00:04:03.958\nthese are young women in the audience of the program --\n\n00:04:03.958 --> 00:04:07.958\nin Abu Dhabi, but also people in the viewing audience.\n\n00:04:07.958 --> 00:04:09.958\nNow you'd think that \"American Idol\"\n\n00:04:09.958 --> 00:04:12.958\nwould introduce a measure of Americanization.\n\n00:04:12.958 --> 00:04:15.958\nBut actually, just the opposite is happening.\n\n00:04:15.958 --> 00:04:18.958\nBy using this engaging popular format\n\n00:04:18.958 --> 00:04:21.958\nfor traditional, local culture,\n\n00:04:21.958 --> 00:04:24.958\nit actually, in the Gulf, is precipitating a revival\n\n00:04:24.958 --> 00:04:26.958\nof interest in Nabati poetry,\n\n00:04:26.958 --> 00:04:30.958\nalso in traditional dress and dance and music.\n\n00:04:30.958 --> 00:04:32.958\nAnd for Afghanistan,\n\n00:04:32.958 --> 00:04:36.958\nwhere the Taliban banned music for many years,\n\n00:04:36.958 --> 00:04:38.958\nit is reintroducing their traditional music.\n\n00:04:38.958 --> 00:04:40.958\nThey don't sing pop songs,\n\n00:04:40.958 --> 00:04:43.958\nthey sing Afghan music.\n\n00:04:43.958 --> 00:04:46.958\nAnd they also have learned how to lose gracefully,\n\n00:04:46.958 --> 00:04:48.958\nwithout avenging the winner.\n\n00:04:48.958 --> 00:04:50.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:04:50.958 --> 00:04:52.958\nNo small thing.\n\n00:04:52.958 --> 00:04:58.958\nAnd the final, sort of, formulation\n\n00:04:58.958 --> 00:05:01.958\nof this \"American Idol\" format,\n\n00:05:01.958 --> 00:05:03.958\nwhich has just appeared in Afghanistan,\n\n00:05:03.958 --> 00:05:06.958\nis a new program called \"The Candidate.\"\n\n00:05:06.958 --> 00:05:08.958\nAnd in this program, people present\n\n00:05:08.958 --> 00:05:11.958\npolicy platforms that are then voted on.\n\n00:05:11.958 --> 00:05:14.958\nMany of them are too young to run for president,\n\n00:05:14.958 --> 00:05:16.958\nbut by putting the issues out there,\n\n00:05:16.958 --> 00:05:18.958\nthey are influencing the presidential race.\n\n00:05:18.958 --> 00:05:21.958\nSo for me, the substance of things unseen\n\n00:05:21.958 --> 00:05:25.958\nis how reality TV is driving reality.\n\n00:05:25.958 --> 00:05:27.958\nThank you.\n\n00:05:27.958 --> 00:05:28.958\n(Applause)"}, {"title": "The thrilling potential of SixthSense technology", "duration": "830", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/pranav_mistry_the_thrilling_potential_of_sixthsense_technology", "transcript": "We grew up interacting with the physical objects around us. There are an enormous number of them that we use every day. Unlike most of our computing devices, these objects are much more fun to use. When you talk about objects, one other thing automatically comes attached to that thing, and that is gestures: how we manipulate these objects, how we use these objects in everyday life. We use gestures not only to interact with these objects, but we also use them to interact with each other. A gesture of \"Namaste!\", maybe, to respect someone, or maybe, in India I don't need to teach a kid that this means \"four runs\" in cricket. It comes as a part of our everyday learning.So, I am very interested, from the beginning, how our knowledge about everyday objects and gestures, and how we use these objects, can be leveraged to our interactions with the digital world. Rather than using a keyboard and mouse, why can I not use my computer in the same way that I interact in the physical world?So, I started this exploration around eight years back, and it literally started with a mouse on my desk. Rather than using it for my computer, I actually opened it. Most of you might be aware that, in those days, the mouse used to come with a ball inside, and there were two rollers that actually guide the computer where the ball is moving, and, accordingly, where the mouse is moving. So, I was interested in these two rollers, and I actually wanted more, so I borrowed another mouse from a friend \u2014 never returned to him \u2014 and I now had four rollers. Interestingly, what I did with these rollers is, basically, I took them off of these mouses and then put them in one line. It had some strings and pulleys and some springs. What I got is basically a gesture-interface device that actually acts as a motion-sensing device made for two dollars. So, here, whatever movement I do in my physical world is actually replicated inside the digital world just using this small device that I made, around eight years back, in 2000.Because I was interested in integrating these two worlds, I thought of sticky notes. I thought, \"Why can I not connect the normal interface of a physical sticky note to the digital world?\" A message written on a sticky note to my mom, on paper, can come to an SMS, or maybe a meeting reminder automatically syncs with my digital calendar \u2014 a to-do list that automatically syncs with you. But you can also search in the digital world, or maybe you can write a query, saying, \"What is Dr. Smith's address?\" and this small system actually prints it out \u2014 so it actually acts like a paper input-output system, just made out of paper.In another exploration, I thought of making a pen that can draw in three dimensions. So, I implemented this pen that can help designers and architects not only think in three dimensions, but they can actually draw, so that it's more intuitive to use that way.Then I thought, \"Why not make a Google Map, but in the physical world?\" Rather than typing a keyword to find something, I put my objects on top of it. If I put a boarding pass, it will show me where the flight gate is. A coffee cup will show where you can find more coffee, or where you can trash the cup.So, these were some of the earlier explorations I did because the goal was to connect these two worlds seamlessly. Among all these experiments, there was one thing in common: I was trying to bring a part of the physical world to the digital world. I was taking some part of the objects, or any of the intuitiveness of real life, and bringing them to the digital world, because the goal was to make our computing interfaces more intuitive.But then I realized that we humans are not actually interested in computing. What we are interested in is information. We want to know about things. We want to know about dynamic things going around.So I thought, around last year \u2014 in the beginning of the last year \u2014 I started thinking, \"Why can I not take this approach in the reverse way?\" Maybe, \"How about I take my digital world and paint the physical world with that digital information?\" Because pixels are actually, right now, confined in these rectangular devices that fit in our pockets. Why can I not remove this confine and take that to my everyday objects, everyday life so that I don't need to learn the new language for interacting with those pixels?So, in order to realize this dream, I actually thought of putting a big-size projector on my head. I think that's why this is called a head-mounted projector, isn't it? I took it very literally, and took my bike helmet, put a little cut over there so that the projector actually fits nicely. So now, what I can do \u2014 I can augment the world around me with this digital information.But later, I realized that I actually wanted to interact with those digital pixels, also. So I put a small camera over there that acts as a digital eye. Later, we moved to a much better, consumer-oriented pendant version of that, that many of you now know as the SixthSense device.But the most interesting thing about this particular technology is that you can carry your digital world with you wherever you go. You can start using any surface, any wall around you, as an interface. The camera is actually tracking all your gestures. Whatever you're doing with your hands, it's understanding that gesture. And, actually, if you see, there are some color markers that in the beginning version we are using with it. You can start painting on any wall. You stop by a wall, and start painting on that wall. But we are not only tracking one finger, here. We are giving you the freedom of using all of both of your hands, so you can actually use both of your hands to zoom into or zoom out of a map just by pinching all present. The camera is actually doing \u2014 just, getting all the images \u2014 is doing the edge recognition and also the color recognition and so many other small algorithms are going on inside. So, technically, it's a little bit complex, but it gives you an output which is more intuitive to use, in some sense.But I'm more excited that you can actually take it outside. Rather than getting your camera out of your pocket, you can just do the gesture of taking a photo, and it takes a photo for you.(Applause)Thank you. And later I can find a wall, anywhere, and start browsing those photos or maybe, \"OK, I want to modify this photo a little bit and send it as an email to a friend.\" So, we are looking for an era where computing will actually merge with the physical world. And, of course, if you don't have any surface, you can start using your palm for simple operations. Here, I'm dialing a phone number just using my hand. The camera is actually not only understanding your hand movements, but, interestingly, is also able to understand what objects you are holding in your hand.For example, in this case, the book cover is matched with so many thousands, or maybe millions of books online, and checking out which book it is. Once it has that information, it finds out more reviews about that, or maybe New York Times has a sound overview on that, so you can actually hear, on a physical book, a review as sound.(Video) Famous talk at Harvard University \u2014This was Obama's visit last week to MIT.(Video) And particularly I want to thank two outstanding MIT \u2014Pranav Mistry: So, I was seeing the live [video] of his talk, outside, on just a newspaper. Your newspaper will show you live weather information rather than having it updated. You have to check your computer in order to do that, right?(Applause)When I'm going back, I can just use my boarding pass to check how much my flight has been delayed, because at that particular time, I'm not feeling like opening my iPhone, and checking out a particular icon. And I think this technology will not only change the way \u2014(Laughter)Yes. It will change the way we interact with people, also, not only the physical world. The fun part is, I'm going to the Boston metro, and playing a pong game inside the train on the ground, right?(Laughter)And I think the imagination is the only limit of what you can think of when this kind of technology merges with real life.But many of you argue, actually, that all of our work is not only about physical objects. We actually do lots of accounting and paper editing and all those kinds of things; what about that? And many of you are excited about the next-generation tablet computers to come out in the market.So, rather than waiting for that, I actually made my own, just using a piece of paper. So, what I did here is remove the camera \u2014 All the webcam cameras have a microphone inside the camera. I removed the microphone from that, and then just pinched that \u2014 like I just made a clip out of the microphone \u2014 and clipped that to a piece of paper, any paper that you found around. So now the sound of the touch is getting me when exactly I'm touching the paper. But the camera is actually tracking where my fingers are moving.You can of course watch movies.(Video) Good afternoon. My name is Russell, and I am a Wilderness Explorer in Tribe 54.\"PM: And you can of course play games.(Car engine)Here, the camera is actually understanding how you're holding the paper and playing a car-racing game.(Applause)Many of you already must have thought, OK, you can browse. Yeah. Of course you can browse to any websites or you can do all sorts of computing on a piece of paper wherever you need it. So, more interestingly, I'm interested in how we can take that in a more dynamic way. When I come back to my desk, I can just pinch that information back to my desktop so I can use my full-size computer.(Applause)And why only computers? We can just play with papers. Paper world is interesting to play with. Here, I'm taking a part of a document, and putting over here a second part from a second place, and I'm actually modifying the information that I have over there. Yeah. And I say, \"OK, this looks nice, let me print it out, that thing.\" So I now have a print-out of that thing. So the workflow is more intuitive, the way we used to do it maybe 20 years back, rather than now switching between these two worlds.So, as a last thought, I think that integrating information to everyday objects will not only help us to get rid of the digital divide, the gap between these two worlds, but will also help us, in some way, to stay human, to be more connected to our physical world. And it will actually help us not end up being machines sitting in front of other machines.That's all. Thank you.(Applause)Thank you.(Applause)Chris Anderson: So, Pranav, first of all, you're a genius. This is incredible, really. What are you doing with this? Is there a company being planned? Or is this research forever, or what?Pranav Mistry: So, there are lots of companies, sponsor companies of Media Lab interested in taking this ahead in one or another way. Companies like mobile-phone operators want to take this in a different way than the NGOs in India, thinking, \"Why can we only have 'Sixth Sense'? We should have a 'Fifth Sense' for missing-sense people who cannot speak. This technology can be used for them to speak out in a different way maybe a speaker system.\"CA: What are your own plans? Are you staying at MIT, or are you going to do something with this?PM: I'm trying to make this more available to people so that anyone can develop their own SixthSense device, because the hardware is actually not that hard to manufacture or hard to make your own. We will provide all the open source software for them, maybe starting next month.CA: Open source? Wow.(Applause)CA: Are you going to come back to India with some of this, at some point?PM: Yeah. Yes, yes, of course.CA: What are your plans? MIT? India? How are you going to split your time going forward?PM: There is a lot of energy here. Lots of learning. All of this work that you have seen is all about my learning in India. And now, if you see, it's more about the cost-effectiveness: this system costs you $300 compared to the $20,000 surface tables, or anything like that. Or maybe even the $2 mouse gesture system at that time was costing around $5,000? I showed that, at a conference, to President Abdul Kalam, at that time, and then he said, \"OK, we should use this in Bhabha Atomic Research Centre for some use of that.\" So I'm excited about how I can bring the technology to the masses rather than just keeping that technology in the lab environment.(Applause)CA: Based on the people we've seen at TED, I would say you're truly one of the two or three best inventors in the world right now. It's an honor to have you at TED. Thank you so much. That's fantastic.(Applause)", "id": 685, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:11.958 --> 00:00:13.934\nWe grew up\n\n00:00:13.958 -->

actually acts like a paper\ninput-output system,\n\n00:02:56.674 --> 00:02:59.459\njust made out of paper.\n\n00:03:01.958 --> 00:03:03.934\nIn another exploration,\n\n00:03:03.958 --> 00:03:06.934\nI thought of making a pen\nthat can draw in three dimensions.\n\n00:03:06.958 --> 00:03:10.934\nSo, I implemented this pen\nthat can help designers and architects\n\n00:03:10.958 --> 00:03:12.934\nnot only think in three dimensions,\n\n00:03:12.958 --> 00:03:14.934\nbut they can actually draw,\n\n00:03:14.958 --> 00:03:17.006\nso that it's more intuitive\nto use that way.\n\n00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:19.078\nThen I thought,\n\"Why not make a Google Map,\n\n00:03:19.102 --> 00:03:20.934\nbut in the physical world?\"\n\n00:03:20.958 --> 00:03:23.934\nRather than typing a keyword\nto find something,\n\n00:03:23.958 --> 00:03:25.934\nI put my objects on top of it.\n\n00:03:25.958 --> 00:03:29.149\nIf I put a boarding pass, it will show me\nwhere the flight gate is.\n\n00:03:29.173 --> 00:03:31.934\nA coffee cup will show\nwhere you can find more coffee,\n\n00:03:31.958 --> 00:03:33.934\nor where you can trash the cup.\n\n00:03:33.958 --> 00:03:36.934\nSo, these were some\nof the earlier explorations I did\n\n00:03:36.958 --> 00:03:39.958\nbecause the goal was to connect\nthese two worlds seamlessly.\n\n00:03:40.958 --> 00:03:42.934\nAmong all these experiments,\n\n00:03:42.958 --> 00:03:44.934\nthere was one thing in common:\n\n00:03:44.958 --> 00:03:48.463\nI was trying to bring\na part of the physical world\n\n00:03:48.487 --> 00:03:49.985\nto the digital world.\n\n00:03:50.009 --> 00:03:51.934\nI was taking some part of the objects,\n\n00:03:51.958 --> 00:03:54.935\nor any of the intuitiveness of real life,\n\n00:03:54.959 --> 00:03:57.148\nand bringing them to the digital world,\n\n00:03:57.172 --> 00:04:01.197\nbecause the goal was to make\nour computing interfaces more intuitive.\n\n00:04:01.221 --> 00:04:05.934\nBut then I realized that we humans\nare not actually interested in computing.\n\n00:04:05.958 --> 00:04:08.934\nWhat we are interested in is information.\n\n00:04:08.958 --> 00:04:10.934\nWe want to know about things.\n\n00:04:10.958 --> 00:04:13.339\nWe want to know about\ndynamic things going around.\n\n00:04:13.363 --> 00:04:17.934\nSo I thought, around last year --\nin the beginning of the last year --\n\n00:04:17.958 --> 00:04:21.435\nI started thinking, \"Why can I not take\nthis approach in the reverse way?\"\n\n00:04:22.077 --> 00:04:24.134\nMaybe, \"How about I take my digital world\n\n00:04:24.158 --> 00:04:28.934\nand paint the physical world\nwith that digital information?\"\n\n00:04:30.112 --> 00:04:33.734\nBecause pixels are actually, right now,\nconfined in these rectangular devices\n\n00:04:33.758 --> 00:04:35.505\nthat fit in our pockets.\n\n00:04:35.529 --> 00:04:37.934\nWhy can I not remove this confine\n\n00:04:37.958 --> 00:04:40.934\nand take that to my everyday\nobjects, everyday life\n\n00:04:40.958 --> 00:04:43.101\nso that I don't need\nto learn the new language\n\n00:04:43.125 --> 00:04:44.922\nfor interacting with those pixels?\n\n00:04:46.172 --> 00:04:48.934\nSo, in order to realize this dream,\n\n00:04:48.958 --> 00:04:51.934\nI actually thought of putting\na big-size projector on my head.\n\n00:04:51.958 --> 00:04:55.197\nI think that's why this is called\na head-mounted projector, isn't it?\n\n00:04:55.221 --> 00:04:56.934\nI took it very literally,\n\n00:04:56.958 --> 00:04:58.934\nand took my bike helmet,\n\n00:04:58.958 --> 00:05:02.339\nput a little cut over there so that\nthe projector actually fits nicely.\n\n00:05:02.363 --> 00:05:03.934\nSo now, what I can do --\n\n00:05:03.958 --> 00:05:07.763\nI can augment the world around me\nwith this digital information.\n\n00:05:08.616 --> 00:05:09.834\nBut later,\n\n00:05:09.858 --> 00:05:12.017\nI realized that I actually\nwanted to interact\n\n00:05:12.041 --> 00:05:13.634\nwith those digital pixels, also.\n\n00:05:13.658 --> 00:05:16.934\nSo I put a small camera over there\nthat acts as a digital eye.\n\n00:05:16.958 --> 00:05:18.934\nLater, we moved to a much better,\n\n00:05:18.958 --> 00:05:20.958\nconsumer-oriented pendant version of that,\n\n00:05:20.982 --> 00:05:23.934\nthat many of you now know\nas the SixthSense device.\n\n00:05:23.958 --> 00:05:26.934\nBut the most interesting thing\nabout this particular technology\n\n00:05:26.958 --> 00:05:30.934\nis that you can carry\nyour digital world with you\n\n00:05:30.958 --> 00:05:32.934\nwherever you go.\n\n00:05:32.958 --> 00:05:35.934\nYou can start using any surface,\nany wall around you,\n\n00:05:35.958 --> 00:05:37.934\nas an interface.\n\n00:05:37.958 --> 00:05:40.934\nThe camera is actually tracking\nall your gestures.\n\n00:05:40.958 --> 00:05:42.934\nWhatever you're doing with your hands,\n\n00:05:42.958 --> 00:05:44.934\nit's understanding that gesture.\n\n00:05:44.958 --> 00:05:47.534\nAnd, actually, if you see,\nthere are some color markers\n\n00:05:47.558 --> 00:05:50.034\nthat in the beginning version\nwe are using with it.\n\n00:05:50.058 --> 00:05:51.934\nYou can start painting on any wall.\n\n00:05:51.958 --> 00:05:54.934\nYou stop by a wall,\nand start painting on that wall.\n\n00:05:54.958 --> 00:05:57.101\nBut we are not only tracking\none finger, here.\n\n00:05:57.125 --> 00:06:00.934\nWe are giving you the freedom\nof using all of both of your hands,\n\n00:06:00.958 --> 00:06:04.101\nso you can actually use both of your hands\nto zoom into or zoom out\n\n00:06:04.125 --> 00:06:06.101\nof a map just by pinching all present.\n\n00:06:06.125 --> 00:06:09.934\nThe camera is actually doing --\njust, getting all the images --\n\n00:06:09.958 --> 00:06:12.934\nis doing the edge recognition\nand also the color recognition\n\n00:06:12.958 --> 00:06:15.934\nand so many other small algorithms\nare going on inside.\n\n00:06:15.958 --> 00:06:17.958\nSo, technically,\nit's a little bit complex,\n\n00:06:17.982 --> 00:06:21.458\nbut it gives you an output which is more\nintuitive to use, in some sense.\n\n00:06:21.482 --> 00:06:24.334\nBut I'm more excited that you can\nactually take it outside.\n\n00:06:24.358 --> 00:06:26.934\nRather than getting your camera\nout of your pocket,\n\n00:06:26.958 --> 00:06:29.934\nyou can just do the gesture\nof taking a photo,\n\n00:06:29.958 --> 00:06:31.934\nand it takes a photo for you.\n\n00:06:31.958 --> 00:06:35.934\n(Applause)\n\n00:06:35.958 --> 00:06:36.958\nThank you.\n\n00:06:37.557 --> 00:06:39.934\nAnd later I can find a wall, anywhere,\n\n00:06:39.958 --> 00:06:41.934\nand start browsing those photos\n\n00:06:41.958 --> 00:06:44.634\nor maybe, \"OK, I want to modify\nthis photo a little bit\n\n00:06:44.658 --> 00:06:46.644\nand send it as an email to a friend.\"\n\n00:06:46.668 --> 00:06:48.934\nSo, we are looking for an era\n\n00:06:48.958 --> 00:06:51.934\nwhere computing will actually merge\nwith the physical world.\n\n00:06:51.958 --> 00:06:54.934\nAnd, of course,\nif you don't have any surface,\n\n00:06:54.958 --> 00:06:57.934\nyou can start using your palm\nfor simple operations.\n\n00:06:57.958 --> 00:07:00.435\nHere, I'm dialing a phone number\njust using my hand.\n\n00:07:03.838 --> 00:07:06.934\nThe camera is actually not\nonly understanding your hand movements,\n\n00:07:06.958 --> 00:07:08.134\nbut, interestingly,\n\n00:07:08.158 --> 00:07:11.397\nis also able to understand what objects\nyou are holding in your hand.\n\n00:07:11.967 --> 00:07:15.934\nFor example, in this case,\n\n00:07:15.958 --> 00:07:17.934\nthe book cover is matched\n\n00:07:17.958 --> 00:07:20.934\nwith so many thousands,\nor maybe millions of books online,\n\n00:07:20.958 --> 00:07:22.934\nand checking out which book it is.\n\n00:07:22.958 --> 00:07:24.434\nOnce it has that information,\n\n00:07:24.458 --> 00:07:26.334\nit finds out more reviews about that,\n\n00:07:26.358 --> 00:07:28.934\nor maybe New York Times\nhas a sound overview on that,\n\n00:07:28.958 --> 00:07:31.054\nso you can actually hear,\non a physical book,\n\n00:07:31.078 --> 00:07:32.934\na review as sound.\n\n00:07:32.958 --> 00:07:35.134\n(Video) Famous talk\nat Harvard University --\n\n00:07:35.158 --> 00:07:38.934\nThis was Obama's visit last week to MIT.\n\n00:07:38.958 --> 00:07:42.423\n(Video) And particularly I want\nto thank two outstanding MIT --\n\n00:07:42.447 --> 00:07:45.481\nPranav Mistry: So, I was seeing\nthe live [video] of his talk,\n\n00:07:45.505 --> 00:07:47.447\noutside, on just a newspaper.\n\n00:07:47.958 --> 00:07:50.934\nYour newspaper will show you\nlive weather information\n\n00:07:50.958 --> 00:07:53.564\nrather than having it updated.\n\n00:07:53.588 --> 00:07:56.435\nYou have to check your computer\nin order to do that, right?\n\n00:07:56.459 --> 00:08:00.934\n(Applause)\n\n00:08:00.958 --> 00:08:03.934\nWhen I'm going back,\nI can just use my boarding pass\n\n00:08:03.958 --> 00:08:06.054\nto check how much my flight\nhas been delayed,\n\n00:08:06.078 --> 00:08:07.934\nbecause at that particular time,\n\n00:08:07.958 --> 00:08:09.934\nI'm not feeling like opening my iPhone,\n\n00:08:09.958 --> 00:08:11.934\nand checking out a particular icon.\n\n00:08:11.958 --> 00:08:15.092\nAnd I think this technology\nwill not only change the way --\n\n00:08:15.116 --> 00:08:16.092\n(Laughter)\n\n00:08:16.116 --> 00:08:17.134\nYes.\n\n00:08:17.158 --> 00:08:19.636\nIt will change the way\nwe interact with people, also,\n\n00:08:19.660 --> 00:08:21.175\nnot only the physical world.\n\n00:08:21.199 --> 00:08:23.934\nThe fun part is, I'm going\nto the Boston metro,\n\n00:08:23.958 --> 00:08:28.934\nand playing a pong game inside the train\non the ground, right?\n\n00:08:28.958 --> 00:08:30.034\n(Laughter)\n\n00:08:30.058 --> 00:08:32.154\nAnd I think the imagination\nis the only limit\n\n00:08:32.178 --> 00:08:33.934\nof what you can think of\n\n00:08:33.958 --> 00:08:36.434\nwhen this kind of technology\nmerges with real life.\n\n00:08:36.458 --> 00:08:38.334\nBut many of you argue, actually,\n\n00:08:38.358 --> 00:08:41.034\nthat all of our work is not\nonly about physical objects.\n\n00:08:41.058 --> 00:08:44.034\nWe actually do lots\nof accounting and paper editing\n\n00:08:44.058 --> 00:08:46.349\nand all those kinds of things;\nwhat about that?\n\n00:08:46.373 --> 00:08:49.934\nAnd many of you are excited\nabout the next-generation tablet computers\n\n00:08:49.958 --> 00:08:51.934\nto come out in the market.\n\n00:08:51.958 --> 00:08:53.934\nSo, rather than waiting for that,\n\n00:08:53.958 --> 00:08:56.934\nI actually made my own,\njust using a piece of paper.\n\n00:08:56.958 --> 00:08:58.958\nSo, what I did here\nis remove the camera --\n\n00:08:58.982 --> 00:09:02.934\nAll the webcam cameras have\na microphone inside the camera.\n\n00:09:02.958 --> 00:09:05.934\nI removed the microphone from that,\n\n00:09:05.958 --> 00:09:07.934\nand then just pinched that --\n\n00:09:07.958 --> 00:09:10.934\nlike I just made a clip\nout of the microphone --\n\n00:09:10.958 --> 00:09:14.934\nand clipped that to a piece of paper,\nany paper that you found around.\n\n00:09:14.958 --> 00:09:17.934\nSo now the sound of the touch\n\n00:09:17.958 --> 00:09:20.934\nis getting me when exactly\nI'm touching the paper.\n\n00:09:20.958 --> 00:09:24.934\nBut the camera is actually tracking\nwhere my fingers are moving.\n\n00:09:24.958 --> 00:09:27.934\nYou can of course watch movies.\n\n00:09:27.958 --> 00:09:30.934\n(Video) Good afternoon.\nMy name is Russell,\n\n00:09:30.958 --> 00:09:33.934\nand I am a Wilderness\nExplorer in Tribe 54.\"\n\n00:09:33.958 --> 00:09:36.934\nPM: And you can of course play games.\n\n00:09:36.958 --> 00:09:39.934\n(Car engine)\n\n00:09:39.958 --> 00:09:43.292\nHere, the camera is actually understanding\nhow you're holding the paper\n\n00:09:43.316 --> 00:09:44.934\nand playing a car-racing game.\n\n00:09:44.958 --> 00:09:47.958\n(Applause)\n\n00:09:49.354 --> 00:09:52.132\nMany of you already must have\nthought, OK, you can browse.\n\n00:09:52.156 --> 00:09:54.434\nYeah. Of course you can\nbrowse to any websites\n\n00:09:54.458 --> 00:09:57.134\nor you can do all sorts\nof computing on a piece of paper\n\n00:09:57.158 --> 00:09:58.334\nwherever you need it.\n\n00:09:58.358 --> 00:10:00.934\nSo, more interestingly,\n\n00:10:00.958 --> 00:10:03.934\nI'm interested in how we can\ntake that in a more dynamic way.\n\n00:10:03.958 --> 00:10:06.934\nWhen I come back to my desk,\nI can just pinch that information\n\n00:10:06.958 --> 00:10:08.934\nback to my desktop\n\n00:10:08.958 --> 00:10:11.934\nso I can use my full-size computer.\n\n00:10:11.958 --> 00:10:13.934\n(Applause)\n\n00:10:13.958 --> 00:10:16.934\nAnd why only computers?\nWe can just play with papers.\n\n00:10:16.958 --> 00:10:19.934\nPaper world is interesting to play with.\n\n00:10:19.958 --> 00:10:21.934\nHere, I'm taking a part of a document,\n\n00:10:21.958 --> 00:10:25.934\nand putting over here a second part\nfrom a second place,\n\n00:10:25.958 --> 00:10:30.934\nand I'm actually modifying the information\nthat I have over there.\n\n00:10:30.958 --> 00:10:35.934\nYeah. And I say, \"OK, this looks nice,\nlet me print it out, that thing.\"\n\n00:10:35.958 --> 00:10:38.339\nSo I now have a print-out of that thing.\n\n00:10:38.363 --> 00:10:40.687\nSo the workflow is more intuitive,\n\n00:10:40.711 --> 00:10:43.934\nthe way we used to do it\nmaybe 20 years back,\n\n00:10:43.958 --> 00:10:46.934\nrather than now switching\nbetween these two worlds.\n\n00:10:46.958 --> 00:10:49.934\nSo, as a last thought,\n\n00:10:49.958 --> 00:10:54.334\nI think that integrating\ninformation to everyday objects\n\n00:10:54.358 --> 00:10:57.934\nwill not only help us to get rid\nof the digital divide,\n\n00:10:57.958 --> 00:10:59.934\nthe gap between these two worlds,\n\n00:10:59.958 --> 00:11:01.934\nbut will also help us, in some way,\n\n00:11:01.958 --> 00:11:03.934\nto stay human,\n\n00:11:03.958 --> 00:11:06.958\nto be more connected\nto our physical world.\n\n00:11:10.366 --> 00:11:12.934\nAnd it will actually help us\nnot end up being machines\n\n00:11:12.958 --> 00:11:14.676\nsitting in front of other machines.\n\n00:11:15.465 --> 00:11:17.934\nThat's all.

Actually this creature is the result of the Penfield research. He named it homunculus. Basically the homunculus is the visualization of a human being where each part of the body is proportional to the surface it takes in the brain. So, of course, homunculus is definitely not a freak. It's you. It's me. It's our invisible reality. This visualization could explain, for example, why newborns, or smokers, put, instinctively, their fingers in the mouth. Unfortunately it doesn't explain why so many designers remain mainly interested in designing chairs.So anyway, even if I do not understand science entirely, for my design I essentially refer to it. I'm fascinated by its ability to deeply investigate the human being, its way of working, its way of feeling. And it really helps me to understand how we see, how we hear, how we breathe, how our brain can inform or mislead us. It's a great tool for me to understand what could be our real needs.Marketing people have never been able to do that. Marketing reduces things. Marketing simplifies. Marketing creates user groups. And scientists, amidst complexity, amidst fluctuation and uniqueness. What could be our real needs? Maybe the silence. In our daily life we are continuously disturbed by aggressive sounds. And you know all those kind of sound puts us in a kind of stressful state, and prevent us from being quiet and focused. So I wanted to create a kind of sound filter, able to preserve ourselves from noise pollution. But I didn't want it to make it by isolating people, without any earmuffs or those kind of things. Or neither with including complex technology. I just wanted to, using the complexity and the technology of the brain, of the human brain.So I worked with white noise. dB is basically \u2014 dB is the name of the product, basically a white noise diffuser. This is white noise. The white noise is the sum of all frequencies that are audible by the human being, brought to the same intensity. And this noise is like a \"shhhhhhhhhhhhh,\" like that. And this noise is the most neutral. It is the perfect sound for our ears and our brain. So when you hear this sound you feel like a kind of shelter, preserved from noise pollution. And when you hear the white noise, your brain is immediately focused on it. And do not be disturbed any more by the other aggressive sound. It seems to be magic. But it is just physiology. It's just in your brain. And in mine, I hope.So in order to make this white noise a little bit active and reactive, I create a ball, a rolling ball able to analyze and find where does aggressive sound come from, and roll, at home or at work, towards aggressive noise, and emits white noise in order to neutralize it. (Laughter) It works. You feel the effect of the white noise? It's too in silence. If you make some noise you can feel the effect.So even if this object, even if this product includes some technology, it includes some speakers, it includes some microphones and some electronic devices, this object is not a very smart object. And I don't want to make a very smart object. I don't want to create a perfect object like a perfect robot. I want to create an object like you and me. So, definitely not perfect. So imagine, for instance, you are at home. A loving dispute with your girl or boyfriend. You shout. You say, \"Blah blah blah, Blah blah blah. Who is this guy?\" And dB will probably roll toward you. And turning around you is \"shhhhhhh,\" like that. (Laughter) Definitely not perfect. So you would probably shut it, at this point. (Laughter)Anyway, in this same kind of approach, I designed K. K is a daylight receiver transmitter. So this object is supposed to be displayed on your desk, or on your piano, where you are supposed to spend most of your time in the day. And this object will be able to know exactly the quantity of light you receive during the day, and able to give you the quantity of light you need. This object is completely covered by fiber opticals. And the idea of those fiber opticals is to inform the object, for sure, but creates the idea of an eye sensibility of the object. I want, by this design feel, when you see it, you see, instinctively, this object seems to be very sensitive, very reactive. And this object knows, better than you and probably before you, what you really need. You have to know that the lack of daylight can provoke some problem of energy, or problem of libido. So, a huge problem. (Laughter)Most of the projects I work on \u2014 I live in collaboration with scientists. I'm just a designer. So I need them. So there can be some biologists, psychiatrists, mathematicians, and so on. And I submit them, my intuitions, my hypothesis, my first ideas. And they react. They told me what is possible, what is impossible. And together we improve the original concept. And we build the project to the end. And this kind of relationship between designer and scientist started when I was at school.Indeed in my studies I was a guinea pig for a pharmaceutical industry. And the irony for me was of course, I didn't do that for the sake of science progress. I just do that to make money. Anyway, this project, or this experience, make me start a new project on the design of medicine. You have to know that today, roughly one or two every drug pills is not taken correctly. So even if the active constituents in pharmaceuticals made constant progress in terms of chemistry, target of stability, the behavior of the patients goes more and more unstable. So we took too many of them. We took irregular dosage. We do not follow instructions. And so on.So I wanted to create a new kind of medicine, in order to create a new kind of relationship between the patient and the treatment. So I turned traditional pills into this. I'm going to give you some example. This one is an antibiotic. And its purpose is to help patient to go to the end of the treatment. And the concept is to create a kind of onion, a kind of structure in layers. So, you start with the darkest one. And you are helped to visualize the duration of the treatment. And you are helped to visualize the decrease of the infection. So the first day, this is the big one. And you have to peel and eat one layer a day. And your antibiotic goes smaller and clearer. And you're waiting for recovery as you were waiting for the Christmas day. And you follow the treatment like that, to the end of the treatment. And here you can get the white core. And it means, right, you are in the recovery. (Applause) Thank you.This one is a \"third lung,\" a pharmaceutical device for long-term asthma treatment. I designed it to help kids to follow the treatment. So the idea of this one is to create a relationship between the patient of the treatment but a relationship of dependency. But in this case it is not the medication that is dependent on the patient. This is, the kids will feel the therapeutic object needs him. So the idea is, all night long the elastic skin of the third lung will slowly inflate itself, including air and molecules, for sure. And when the kids wake up, he can see the object needs him. And he take him to his mouth, and breathe the air it contains. So by this way, the kid, to take care of himself, is to take care of this living object. And he does not feel anymore it's relies on asthma treatment, as the asthma treatment needs him. (Applause)In this guise of living object approach, I like the idea of a kind of invisible design, as if the function of the object exists in a kind of invisible field just around the objects themselves. We could talk about a kind of soul, of a ghost accompanying them. And almost a kind of poltergeist effect. So when a passive object like this one seems to be alive, because it is \u2014 woosh \u2014 starting to move.And I remember an exhibition design I made for John Maeda, and for the Fondation Cartier in Paris. And John Maeda was supposed to show several graphic animations in this exhibition. And my idea for this exhibition design was to create a real pong game, like this one. And the idea was to create some self-moving benches in the main exhibition room. So the living benches would be exactly like the ball. And John was so excited by this idea. He said to me, \"Okay let's go.\" I remember the day of the opening. I was a little bit late. When I bring the 10 living and self-moving benches in the exhibition room, John was just beside me, and was like, \"Hmm. Hmm.\" And he told me, after a long silence, \"I wonder, Mathieu, if people won't be more fascinated by your benches than by my videos.\" (Laughter) It would be a great honor, a great compliment for me, if he hadn't decided to take all them off two hours before the opening. So, huge tragedy.I guess you won't be surprised if I tell you that Pinocchio is one of my great influences. Pinocchio is probably one of my best design products, my favorite one. Because it is a kind of object with a conscience, able to be modified by its surroundings, and able to modify it as well. The other great influence is the mine's canary. In coal mines, this canary was supposed to be close to the miners. And it was singing all day long. And when it stops it means that it just died. So this canary was a living alarm, and a very efficient one. A very natural technology, in order to say to the miners, \"The air is too bad. You have to go. It's an emergency.\" So it's, for me, a great product.And I tried to design a kind of canary. Andrea is one. Andrea is a living air filter that absorbs toxic gasses from air, contaminated indoor air. So it uses some plants to do this job, selected for their gas-filtering ability. You have to know, or you probably already know, that indoor air pollution is more toxic than outdoor one. So while I'm talking to you, the seats you are sitting on are currently emitting some invisible and odorless toxic gas. Sorry for that. (Laughter) So you are currently breathing formaldehyde. It's the same for me with the carpet. And this is exactly the same at home. Because all the product we get constantly give away the volatile component of which they're made of.So let's have a look at your home. So your sofa, your plastic chair, your kid's toys give their own invisible reality. And this one is very toxic. This is the reason why I created, with David Edward, a scientist of Harvard University, an object able to absorb the toxic elements using those kind of plants. But the idea is to force the air to go in the effective part of the plants. Because the roots of the plant are not very effective. Bill Wolverton from NASA analyzed it cleverly in the '70s. So the idea is to create an object able to force the air, and to be in contact at the right speed at the right place, in all the effective parts of the plant. So this is the final object. It will be launched next September. (Applause)This one is kind of the same approach because I include, in a product like Andrea, some plants. And in this one, plants are used for the water filtration ability. And it includes some fishes as well. But here, unlike Andrea, here are supposed to be eaten. Indeed, this object is a domestic farm, for fishes and green. So the idea of this object is to be able to get at home very local food. The locavores used to get food taken in a radius of 100 miles. Local River is able to provide you food directly in your living room. So the principle of this object is to create an ecosystem called aquaponics. And the aquaponics is the dirty water of the fish, by a water pump, feeds the plants above. And the plants will filter, by the roots, the dirty water of the fish. After, it goes back into the fish tank.After that you have two options. Or you sit down in front of it like you would do in front your TV set. Amazing channel. Or you start fishing. And you make some sushis with a fish and the aromatic plants above. Because you can grow some potatoes. No, not potatoes, but tomatoes, aromatic plants and so on.So now we can breathe safely. Now we can eat local food. Now we can be treated by smart medicine. Now we can be well-balanced in our biorhythm with daylight. But it was important to create a perfect place, so I tried to, in order to work and create. So I designed, for an American scientist based in Paris, a very stimulative, brain-stimulative office. I wanted to create a perfect place where you can work and play, and where your body and your brain can work together.So, in this office, you do not work anymore at your desk, like a politician. Your seat, your sleep and your play on a big geodesic island made of leather. See, like this one? In this office you do not work and write and draw on a sheet of paper, but you draw directly on a kind of huge whiteboard cave, like a prehistoric scientist. So you, like that, can make some sport during your work. In this office you do not need to go out in order to be in contact with nature. You include, directly, the nature in the floor of the office. You can see it there.This is an inspiration image to lead this project of the office. It really helped me to design it. I never show it to my client. He would be so afraid. (Laughter) Just for my workshop. I guess it may be the revenge of the guinea pig I was. But it's maybe the conviction as monkey and homunculus we are. All of us need to be considered according to our real nature. Thank you very much.

Marketing simplifies.\n\n00:01:52.958 --> 00:01:55.958\nMarketing creates user groups.\n\n00:01:55.958 --> 00:01:58.958\nAnd scientists, amidst complexity,\n\n00:01:58.958 --> 00:02:01.958\namidst fluctuation and uniqueness.\n\n00:02:01.958 --> 00:02:03.958\nWhat could be our real needs?\n\n00:02:03.958 --> 00:02:05.958\nMaybe the silence.\n\n00:02:05.958 --> 00:02:07.958\nIn our daily life we are continuously disturbed by\n\n00:02:07.958 --> 00:02:09.958\naggressive sounds.\n\n00:02:09.958 --> 00:02:11.958\nAnd you know all those kind of sound puts us\n\n00:02:11.958 --> 00:02:13.958\nin a kind of stressful state,\n\n00:02:13.958 --> 00:02:16.958\nand prevent us from being quiet and focused.\n\n00:02:16.958 --> 00:02:18.958\nSo I wanted to create a kind of\n\n00:02:18.958 --> 00:02:21.958\nsound filter,\n\n00:02:21.958 --> 00:02:23.958\nable to preserve ourselves from noise pollution.\n\n00:02:23.958 --> 00:02:26.958\nBut I didn't want it to make it by\n\n00:02:26.958 --> 00:02:29.958\nisolating people, without any earmuffs\n\n00:02:29.958 --> 00:02:31.958\nor those kind of things.\n\n00:02:31.958 --> 00:02:34.958\nOr neither with including complex technology.\n\n00:02:34.958 --> 00:02:38.958\nI just wanted to, using the complexity\n\n00:02:38.958 --> 00:02:41.958\nand the technology of the brain, of the human brain.\n\n00:02:41.958 --> 00:02:44.958\nSo I worked with white noise.\n\n00:02:44.958 --> 00:02:46.958\ndB is basically --\n\n00:02:46.958 --> 00:02:48.958\ndB is the name of the product,\n\n00:02:48.958 --> 00:02:50.958\nbasically a white noise diffuser.\n\n00:02:50.958 --> 00:02:51.958\nThis is white noise.\n\n00:02:51.958 --> 00:02:54.958\nThe white noise is the sum of all frequencies\n\n00:02:54.958 --> 00:02:56.958\nthat are audible by the human being,\n\n00:02:56.958 --> 00:02:58.958\nbrought to the same intensity.\n\n00:02:58.958 --> 00:03:03.958\nAnd this noise is like a \"shhhhhhhhhhhhh,\" like that.\n\n00:03:03.958 --> 00:03:05.958\nAnd this noise is the most neutral.\n\n00:03:05.958 --> 00:03:08.958\nIt is the perfect sound for our ears and our brain.\n\n00:03:08.958 --> 00:03:10.958\nSo when you hear this sound\n\n00:03:10.958 --> 00:03:13.958\nyou feel like a kind of shelter,\n\n00:03:13.958 --> 00:03:16.958\npreserved from noise pollution.\n\n00:03:16.958 --> 00:03:19.958\nAnd when you hear the white noise, your brain is immediately focused on it.\n\n00:03:19.958 --> 00:03:23.958\nAnd do not be disturbed any more by the other aggressive sound.\n\n00:03:23.958 --> 00:03:25.958\nIt seems to be magic.\n\n00:03:25.958 --> 00:03:28.958\nBut it is just physiology. It's just in your brain.\n\n00:03:28.958 --> 00:03:31.958\nAnd in mine, I hope.\n\n00:03:31.958 --> 00:03:34.958\nSo in order to make this white noise\n\n00:03:34.958 --> 00:03:36.958\na little bit active and reactive,\n\n00:03:36.958 --> 00:03:39.958\nI create a ball, a rolling ball\n\n00:03:39.958 --> 00:03:43.958\nable to analyze and find\n\n00:03:43.958 --> 00:03:45.958\nwhere does aggressive sound come from,\n\n00:03:45.958 --> 00:03:48.958\nand roll, at home or at work,\n\n00:03:48.958 --> 00:03:51.958\ntowards aggressive noise,\n\n00:03:51.958 --> 00:03:54.958\nand emits white noise in order to neutralize it.\n\n00:03:54.958 --> 00:03:57.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:03:57.958 --> 00:03:59.958\nIt works.\n\n00:04:11.958 --> 00:04:15.958\nYou feel the effect of the white noise?\n\n00:04:15.958 --> 00:04:17.958\nIt's too in silence.\n\n00:04:17.958 --> 00:04:20.958\nIf you make some noise you can feel the effect.\n\n00:04:20.958 --> 00:04:23.958\nSo even if this object,\n\n00:04:23.958 --> 00:04:25.958\neven if this product includes some technology,\n\n00:04:25.958 --> 00:04:27.958\nit includes some speakers, it includes some microphones\n\n00:04:27.958 --> 00:04:30.958\nand some electronic devices,\n\n00:04:30.958 --> 00:04:33.958\nthis object is not a very smart object.\n\n00:04:33.958 --> 00:04:35.958\nAnd I don't want to make a very smart object.\n\n00:04:35.958 --> 00:04:39.958\nI don't want to create a perfect object like a perfect robot.\n\n00:04:39.958 --> 00:04:42.958\nI want to create an object like you and me.\n\n00:04:42.958 --> 00:04:44.958\nSo, definitely not perfect.\n\n00:04:44.958 --> 00:04:47.958\nSo imagine, for instance, you are at home.\n\n00:04:47.958 --> 00:04:50.958\nA loving dispute with your girl or boyfriend.\n\n00:04:50.958 --> 00:04:53.958\nYou shout. You say, \"Blah blah blah, Blah blah blah. Who is this guy?\"\n\n00:04:53.958 --> 00:04:57.958\nAnd dB will probably roll toward you.\n\n00:04:57.958 --> 00:05:02.958\nAnd turning around you is \"shhhhhhh,\" like that.\n\n00:05:02.958 --> 00:05:03.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:05:03.958 --> 00:05:05.958\nDefinitely not perfect. So you would probably\n\n00:05:05.958 --> 00:05:07.958\nshut it, at this point.\n\n00:05:07.958 --> 00:05:09.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:05:09.958 --> 00:05:12.958\nAnyway, in this same kind of approach,\n\n00:05:12.958 --> 00:05:14.958\nI designed K.\n\n00:05:14.958 --> 00:05:17.958\nK is a daylight receiver transmitter.\n\n00:05:17.958 --> 00:05:20.958\nSo this object is supposed to be displayed on your desk,\n\n00:05:20.958 --> 00:05:22.958\nor on your piano, where you are supposed\n\n00:05:22.958 --> 00:05:24.958\nto spend most of your time in the day.\n\n00:05:24.958 --> 00:05:26.958\nAnd this object will be\n\n00:05:26.958 --> 00:05:29.958\nable to know exactly the quantity of light you receive during the day,\n\n00:05:29.958 --> 00:05:33.958\nand able to give you the quantity of light you need.\n\n00:05:33.958 --> 00:05:36.958\nThis object is completely covered by\n\n00:05:36.958 --> 00:05:38.958\nfiber opticals.\n\n00:05:38.958 --> 00:05:41.958\nAnd the idea of those fiber opticals is to inform the object, for sure,\n\n00:05:41.958 --> 00:05:44.958\nbut creates the idea of an\n\n00:05:44.958 --> 00:05:47.958\neye sensibility of the object.\n\n00:05:47.958 --> 00:05:49.958\nI want, by this design\n\n00:05:49.958 --> 00:05:51.958\nfeel, when you see it,\n\n00:05:51.958 --> 00:05:53.958\nyou see, instinctively,\n\n00:05:53.958 --> 00:05:55.958\nthis object seems to be very sensitive,\n\n00:05:55.958 --> 00:05:57.958\nvery reactive.\n\n00:05:57.958 --> 00:06:00.958\nAnd this object knows, better than you\n\n00:06:00.958 --> 00:06:02.958\nand probably before you, what you really need.\n\n00:06:02.958 --> 00:06:04.958\nYou have to know that the lack of daylight\n\n00:06:04.958 --> 00:06:07.958\ncan provoke some\n\n00:06:07.958 --> 00:06:09.958\nproblem of energy, or problem of libido.\n\n00:06:09.958 --> 00:06:12.958\nSo, a huge problem.\n\n00:06:12.958 --> 00:06:13.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:06:13.958 --> 00:06:15.958\nMost of the projects I work on --\n\n00:06:15.958 --> 00:06:17.958\nI live in collaboration with scientists.\n\n00:06:17.958 --> 00:06:19.958\nI'm just a designer. So I need them.\n\n00:06:19.958 --> 00:06:21.958\nSo there can be some biologists,\n\n00:06:21.958 --> 00:06:24.958\npsychiatrists, mathematicians, and so on.\n\n00:06:24.958 --> 00:06:27.958\nAnd I submit them, my intuitions,\n\n00:06:27.958 --> 00:06:29.958\nmy hypothesis, my first ideas.\n\n00:06:29.958 --> 00:06:32.958\nAnd they react. They told me what is possible, what is impossible.\n\n00:06:32.958 --> 00:06:36.958\nAnd together we improve the original concept.\n\n00:06:36.958 --> 00:06:38.958\nAnd we build the project to the end.\n\n00:06:38.958 --> 00:06:41.958\nAnd this kind of relationship between designer and scientist\n\n00:06:41.958 --> 00:06:43.958\nstarted when I was at school.\n\n00:06:43.958 --> 00:06:46.958\nIndeed in my studies I was a guinea pig\n\n00:06:46.958 --> 00:06:48.958\nfor a pharmaceutical industry.\n\n00:06:48.958 --> 00:06:51.958\nAnd the irony for me was\n\n00:06:51.958 --> 00:06:54.958\nof course, I didn't do that for the sake of science progress.\n\n00:06:54.958 --> 00:06:56.958\nI just do that to make money.\n\n00:06:56.958 --> 00:07:00.958\nAnyway, this project, or this experience,\n\n00:07:00.958 --> 00:07:04.958\nmake me start a new project on the design of medicine.\n\n00:07:04.958 --> 00:07:08.958\nYou have to know that today, roughly one or two every drug pills\n\n00:07:08.958 --> 00:07:10.958\nis not taken correctly.\n\n00:07:10.958 --> 00:07:14.958\nSo even if the active constituents\n\n00:07:14.958 --> 00:07:16.958\nin pharmaceuticals made constant progress\n\n00:07:16.958 --> 00:07:19.958\nin terms of chemistry, target of stability,\n\n00:07:19.958 --> 00:07:21.958\nthe behavior of the patients\n\n00:07:21.958 --> 00:07:24.958\ngoes more and more unstable.\n\n00:07:24.958 --> 00:07:27.958\nSo we took too many of them.\n\n00:07:27.958 --> 00:07:30.958\nWe took irregular dosage.\n\n00:07:30.958 --> 00:07:33.958\nWe do not follow instructions. And so on.\n\n00:07:33.958 --> 00:07:35.958\nSo I wanted to create a\n\n00:07:35.958 --> 00:07:37.958\nnew kind of medicine,\n\n00:07:37.958 --> 00:07:39.958\nin order to create a new kind of relationship\n\n00:07:39.958 --> 00:07:42.958\nbetween the patient and the treatment.\n\n00:07:42.958 --> 00:07:45.958\nSo I turned traditional pills into this.\n\n00:07:45.958 --> 00:07:47.958\nI'm going to give you some example.\n\n00:07:47.958 --> 00:07:50.958\nThis one is an antibiotic.\n\n00:07:50.958 --> 00:07:52.958\nAnd its purpose is to help patient\n\n00:07:52.958 --> 00:07:55.958\nto go to the end of the treatment.\n\n00:07:55.958 --> 00:07:58.958\nAnd the concept is to\n\n00:07:58.958 --> 00:08:00.958\ncreate a kind of onion,\n\n00:08:00.958 --> 00:08:03.958\na kind of structure in layers.\n\n00:08:03.958 --> 00:08:05.958\nSo, you start with the darkest one.\n\n00:08:05.958 --> 00:08:10.958\nAnd you are helped to visualize the duration of the treatment.\n\n00:08:10.958 --> 00:08:13.958\nAnd you are helped to visualize the decrease of the infection.\n\n00:08:13.958 --> 00:08:17.958\nSo the first day, this is the big one.\n\n00:08:17.958 --> 00:08:21.958\nAnd you have to peel and eat one layer a day.\n\n00:08:21.958 --> 00:08:24.958\nAnd your antibiotic goes smaller and clearer.\n\n00:08:24.958 --> 00:08:28.958\nAnd you're waiting for recovery as you were waiting for the Christmas day.\n\n00:08:28.958 --> 00:08:32.958\nAnd you follow the treatment like that,\n\n00:08:32.958 --> 00:08:34.958\nto the end of the treatment.\n\n00:08:34.958 --> 00:08:36.958\nAnd here you can get the white core.\n\n00:08:36.958 --> 00:08:41.958\nAnd it means, right, you are in the recovery.\n\n00:08:41.958 --> 00:08:44.958\n(Applause) Thank you.\n\n00:08:44.958 --> 00:08:46.958\nThis one is a \"third lung,\"\n\n00:08:46.958 --> 00:08:50.958\na pharmaceutical device for long-term asthma treatment.\n\n00:08:50.958 --> 00:08:54.958\nI designed it to help kids to follow the treatment.\n\n00:08:54.958 --> 00:08:56.958\nSo the idea of this one is to create\n\n00:08:56.958 --> 00:08:59.958\na relationship between the patient of the treatment\n\n00:08:59.958 --> 00:09:01.958\nbut a relationship of dependency.\n\n00:09:01.958 --> 00:09:05.958\nBut in this case it is not the medication that is dependent on the patient.\n\n00:09:05.958 --> 00:09:09.958\nThis is, the kids will feel\n\n00:09:09.958 --> 00:09:12.958\nthe therapeutic object needs him.\n\n00:09:12.958 --> 00:09:15.958\nSo the idea is, all night long\n\n00:09:15.958 --> 00:09:17.958\nthe elastic skin of the third lung\n\n00:09:17.958 --> 00:09:19.958\nwill slowly inflate itself,\n\n00:09:19.958 --> 00:09:22.958\nincluding air and molecules, for sure.\n\n00:09:22.958 --> 00:09:24.958\nAnd when the kids wake up,\n\n00:09:24.958 --> 00:09:27.958\nhe can see the object needs him. And he take him to his mouth,\n\n00:09:27.958 --> 00:09:29.958\nand breathe the air it contains.\n\n00:09:29.958 --> 00:09:31.958\nSo by this way,\n\n00:09:31.958 --> 00:09:35.958\nthe kid, to take care of himself,\n\n00:09:35.958 --> 00:09:38.958\nis to take care of this living object.\n\n00:09:38.958 --> 00:09:41.958\nAnd he does not feel anymore it's relies on asthma treatment,\n\n00:09:41.958 --> 00:09:44.958\nas the asthma treatment needs him.\n\n00:09:44.958 --> 00:09:48.958\n(Applause)\n\n00:09:48.958 --> 00:09:52.958\nIn this guise of living object approach,\n\n00:09:52.958 --> 00:09:54.958\nI like the idea of a kind of invisible design,\n\n00:09:54.958 --> 00:09:58.958\nas if the function of the object\n\n00:09:58.958 --> 00:10:01.958\nexists in a kind of invisible field\n\n00:10:01.958 --> 00:10:03.958\njust around the objects themselves.\n\n00:10:03.958 --> 00:10:06.958\nWe could talk about a kind of soul,\n\n00:10:06.958 --> 00:10:09.958\nof a ghost accompanying them.\n\n00:10:09.958 --> 00:10:13.958\nAnd almost a kind of poltergeist effect.\n\n00:10:13.958 --> 00:10:16.958\nSo when a passive object like this one seems to be alive,\n\n00:10:16.958 --> 00:10:19.958\nbecause it is -- woosh -- starting to move.\n\n00:10:19.958 --> 00:10:21.958\nAnd I remember an exhibition design\n\n00:10:21.958 --> 00:10:24.958\nI made for John Maeda,\n\n00:10:24.958 --> 00:10:26.958\nand for the Fondation Cartier in Paris.\n\n00:10:26.958 --> 00:10:29.958\nAnd John Maeda was supposed to show\n\n00:10:29.958 --> 00:10:31.958\nseveral graphic animations in this exhibition.\n\n00:10:31.958 --> 00:10:34.958\nAnd my idea for this exhibition design was to create\n\n00:10:34.958 --> 00:10:37.958\na real pong game, like this one.\n\n00:10:37.958 --> 00:10:40.958\nAnd the idea was to create some self-moving benches\n\n00:10:40.958 --> 00:10:42.958\nin the main exhibition room.\n\n00:10:42.958 --> 00:10:45.958\nSo the living benches would be exactly like the ball.\n\n00:10:45.958 --> 00:10:50.958\nAnd John was so excited by this idea. He said to me, \"Okay let's go.\"\n\n00:10:50.958 --> 00:10:52.958\nI remember the day of the opening.\n\n00:10:52.958 --> 00:10:54.958\nI was a little bit late.\n\n00:10:54.958 --> 00:10:59.958\nWhen I bring the 10 living and self-moving benches\n\n00:10:59.958 --> 00:11:03.958\nin the exhibition room, John was just beside me,\n\n00:11:03.958 --> 00:11:08.958\nand was like, \"Hmm. Hmm.\"\n\n00:11:08.958 --> 00:11:11.958\nAnd he told me, after a long silence,\n\n00:11:11.958 --> 00:11:14.958\n\"I wonder, Mathieu, if\n\n00:11:14.958 --> 00:11:16.958\npeople won't be more fascinated by your benches\n\n00:11:16.958 --> 00:11:18.958\nthan by my videos.\"\n\n00:11:18.958 --> 00:11:21.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:11:21.958 --> 00:11:24.958\nIt would be a great honor, a great compliment for me,\n\n00:11:24.958 --> 00:11:27.958\nif he hadn't decided to take all them off\n\n00:11:27.958 --> 00:11:29.958\ntwo hours before the opening.\n\n00:11:29.958 --> 00:11:32.958\nSo, huge tragedy.\n\n00:11:32.958 --> 00:11:34.958\nI guess you won't be surprised if I tell you\n\n00:11:34.958 --> 00:11:37.958\nthat Pinocchio is one of my great influences.\n\n00:11:37.958 --> 00:11:41.958\nPinocchio is probably one of my best design products, my favorite one.\n\n00:11:41.958 --> 00:11:44.958\nBecause it is a kind of object with a conscience,\n\n00:11:44.958 --> 00:11:46.958\nable to be modified by its surroundings,\n\n00:11:46.958 --> 00:11:49.958\nand able to modify it as well.\n\n00:11:49.958 --> 00:11:51.958\nThe other great influence is the mine's canary.\n\n00:11:51.958 --> 00:11:55.958\nIn coal mines, this canary\n\n00:11:55.958 --> 00:11:58.958\nwas supposed to be close to the miners.\n\n00:11:58.958 --> 00:12:01.958\nAnd it was singing all day long. And when it stops it means that it just died.\n\n00:12:01.958 --> 00:12:05.958\nSo this canary was a living alarm,\n\n00:12:05.958 --> 00:12:07.958\nand a very efficient one.\n\n00:12:07.958 --> 00:12:09.958\nA very natural technology,\n\n00:12:09.958 --> 00:12:12.958\nin order to say to the miners,\n\n00:12:12.958 --> 00:12:17.958\n\"The air is too bad. You have to go. It's an emergency.\"\n\n00:12:17.958 --> 00:12:20.958\nSo it's, for me, a great product.\n\n00:12:20.958 --> 00:12:22.958\nAnd I tried to design a kind of canary.\n\n00:12:22.958 --> 00:12:24.958\nAndrea is one.\n\n00:12:24.958 --> 00:12:27.958\nAndrea is a living air filter that absorbs toxic gasses\n\n00:12:27.958 --> 00:12:31.958\nfrom air, contaminated indoor air.\n\n00:12:31.958 --> 00:12:34.958\nSo it uses some plants to do this job,\n\n00:12:34.958 --> 00:12:39.958\nselected for their gas-filtering ability.\n\n00:12:39.958 --> 00:12:42.958\nYou have to know, or you probably already know,\n\n00:12:42.958 --> 00:12:45.958\nthat indoor air pollution is more toxic than outdoor one.\n\n00:12:45.958 --> 00:12:48.958\nSo while I'm talking to you,\n\n00:12:48.958 --> 00:12:51.958\nthe seats you are sitting on are currently emitting some\n\n00:12:51.958 --> 00:12:55.958\ninvisible and odorless toxic gas. Sorry for that. (Laughter)\n\n00:12:55.958 --> 00:12:59.958\nSo you are currently breathing formaldehyde.\n\n00:12:59.958 --> 00:13:02.958\nIt's the same for me with the carpet.\n\n00:13:02.958 --> 00:13:06.958\nAnd this is exactly the same at home.\n\n00:13:06.958 --> 00:13:10.958\nBecause all the product we get constantly give away\n\n00:13:10.958 --> 00:13:13.958\nthe volatile component of which they're made of.\n\n00:13:13.958 --> 00:13:16.958\nSo let's have a look at your home.\n\n00:13:32.958 --> 00:13:34.958\nSo your sofa, your plastic chair,\n\n00:13:34.958 --> 00:13:36.958\nyour kid's toys\n\n00:13:36.958 --> 00:13:40.958\ngive their own invisible reality. And this one is very toxic.\n\n00:13:40.958 --> 00:13:42.958\nThis is the reason why\n\n00:13:42.958 --> 00:13:44.958\nI created, with David Edward,\n\n00:13:44.958 --> 00:13:46.958\na scientist of Harvard University,\n\n00:13:46.958 --> 00:13:52.958\nan object able to absorb the toxic elements using those kind of plants.\n\n00:13:52.958 --> 00:13:54.958\nBut the idea is to force\n\n00:13:54.958 --> 00:13:57.958\nthe air to go in the effective part of the plants.\n\n00:13:57.958 --> 00:14:00.958\nBecause the roots of the plant are not very effective.\n\n00:14:00.958 --> 00:14:02.958\nBill Wolverton from NASA\n\n00:14:02.958 --> 00:14:06.958\nanalyzed it cleverly in the '70s.\n\n00:14:06.958 --> 00:14:08.958\nSo the idea is to create an object\n\n00:14:08.958 --> 00:14:12.958\nable to force the air, and to be in contact at the right speed\n\n00:14:12.958 --> 00:14:16.958\nat the right place, in all the effective parts of the plant.\n\n00:14:16.958 --> 00:14:18.958\nSo this is the final object.\n\n00:14:18.958 --> 00:14:22.958\nIt will be launched next September.\n\n00:14:22.958 --> 00:14:25.958\n(Applause)\n\n00:14:25.958 --> 00:14:27.958\nThis one is kind of the same approach\n\n00:14:27.958 --> 00:14:29.958\nbecause I include, in a product\n\n00:14:29.958 --> 00:14:32.958\nlike Andrea, some plants.\n\n00:14:32.958 --> 00:14:36.958\nAnd in this one, plants are used for the water filtration ability.\n\n00:14:36.958 --> 00:14:38.958\nAnd it includes some fishes as well.\n\n00:14:38.958 --> 00:14:40.958\nBut here, unlike Andrea,\n\n00:14:40.958 --> 00:14:42.958\nhere are supposed to be eaten.\n\n00:14:42.958 --> 00:14:45.958\nIndeed, this object is a domestic farm,\n\n00:14:45.958 --> 00:14:47.958\nfor fishes and green.\n\n00:14:47.958 --> 00:14:50.958\nSo the idea of this object\n\n00:14:50.958 --> 00:14:53.958\nis to be able to get at home\n\n00:14:53.958 --> 00:14:55.958\nvery local food.\n\n00:14:55.958 --> 00:14:57.958\nThe locavores\n\n00:14:57.958 --> 00:14:59.958\nused to get food\n\n00:14:59.958 --> 00:15:01.958\ntaken in a radius of 100 miles.\n\n00:15:01.958 --> 00:15:03.958\nLocal River is able to provide you\n\n00:15:03.958 --> 00:15:06.958\nfood directly in your living room.\n\n00:15:06.958 --> 00:15:09.958\nSo the principle of this object\n\n00:15:09.958 --> 00:15:11.958\nis to create an ecosystem\n\n00:15:11.958 --> 00:15:13.958\ncalled aquaponics.\n\n00:15:13.958 --> 00:15:17.958\nAnd the aquaponics is the dirty water of the fish,\n\n00:15:17.958 --> 00:15:20.958\nby a water pump, feeds the plants above.\n\n00:15:20.958 --> 00:15:23.958\nAnd the plants will filter, by the roots,\n\n00:15:23.958 --> 00:15:25.958\nthe dirty water of the fish.\n\n00:15:25.958 --> 00:15:29.958\nAfter, it goes back into the fish tank.\n\n00:15:29.958 --> 00:15:31.958\nAfter that you have two options.\n\n00:15:31.958 --> 00:15:34.958\nOr you sit down in front of it like you would do in front your TV set.\n\n00:15:34.958 --> 00:15:37.958\nAmazing channel.\n\n00:15:37.958 --> 00:15:39.958\nOr you start fishing.\n\n00:15:39.958 --> 00:15:42.958\nAnd you make some sushis with a fish\n\n00:15:42.958 --> 00:15:44.958\nand the aromatic plants above.\n\n00:15:44.958 --> 00:15:46.958\nBecause you can grow some potatoes.\n\n00:15:46.958 --> 00:15:48.958\nNo, not potatoes, but tomatoes,\n\n00:15:48.958 --> 00:15:50.958\naromatic plants and so on.\n\n00:15:50.958 --> 00:15:53.958\nSo now we can breathe safely.\n\n00:15:53.958 --> 00:15:56.958\nNow we can eat local food.\n\n00:15:56.958 --> 00:15:59.958\nNow we can be treated by smart medicine.\n\n00:15:59.958 --> 00:16:02.958\nNow we can be well-balanced in our biorhythm\n\n00:16:02.958 --> 00:16:04.958\nwith daylight.\n\n00:16:04.958 --> 00:16:07.958\nBut it was important to create a perfect place,\n\n00:16:07.958 --> 00:16:09.958\nso I tried to,\n\n00:16:09.958 --> 00:16:12.958\nin order to work and create.\n\n00:16:12.958 --> 00:16:16.958\nSo I designed, for an American scientist based in Paris,\n\n00:16:16.958 --> 00:16:19.958\na very stimulative, brain-stimulative office.\n\n00:16:19.958 --> 00:16:22.958\nI wanted to create a perfect place\n\n00:16:22.958 --> 00:16:24.958\nwhere you can work and play,\n\n00:16:24.958 --> 00:16:27.958\nand where your body and your brain can work together.\n\n00:16:27.958 --> 00:16:29.958\nSo, in this office,\n\n00:16:29.958 --> 00:16:33.958\nyou do not work anymore at your desk, like a politician.\n\n00:16:33.958 --> 00:16:37.958\nYour seat, your sleep and your play\n\n00:16:37.958 --> 00:16:41.958\non a big geodesic island made of leather.\n\n00:16:41.958 --> 00:16:43.958\nSee, like this one?\n\n00:16:43.958 --> 00:16:48.958\nIn this office you do not work and write and draw on a sheet of paper,\n\n00:16:48.958 --> 00:16:53.958\nbut you draw directly on a kind of huge whiteboard cave,\n\n00:16:53.958 --> 00:16:55.958\nlike a prehistoric scientist.\n\n00:16:55.958 --> 00:16:59.958\nSo you, like that, can make some sport during your work.\n\n00:16:59.958 --> 00:17:03.958\nIn this office\n\n00:17:03.958 --> 00:17:05.958\nyou

These are not discoveries of planets or new technologies or science. They're discoveries of people and the way people are, and new leadership.This is Benki. Benki is a leader of the Ashaninka Nation. His people live in Brazil and in Peru. Benki comes from a village so remote up in the Amazon that to get there, either you have to fly and land on water, or go by canoe for several days. I met Benki three years ago in Sao Paulo when I'd brought him and other leaders from indigenous peoples to meet with me and leaders from around the world, because we wanted to learn from each other. We wanted to share our stories with each other.The Ashaninka people are known throughout South America for their dignity, their spirit and their resistance, starting with the Incas and continuing through the 19th century with the rubber tappers. Today's biggest threat to the Ashaninka people and to Benki comes from illegal logging \u2014 the people who come into the beautiful forest and cut down ancient mahogany trees, float them down the river to world markets. Benki knew this. He could see what was happening to his forest, to his environment, because he was taken under his grandfather's wing when he was only two years old to begin to learn about the forest and the way of life of his people. His grandfather died when he was only 10. And at that young age, 10 years old, Benki became the paje of his community. Now, in the Ashaninka tradition and culture, the paje is the most important person in the community. This is the person who contains within him all the knowledge, all the wisdom of centuries and centuries of life, and not just about his people, but about everything that his people's survival depended on: the trees, the birds, the water, the soil, the forest. So when he was only 10 and he became the paje, he began to lead his people. He began to talk to them about the forest that they needed to protect, the way of life they needed to nurture. He explained to them that it was not a question of survival of the fittest; it was a question of understanding what they needed to survive and to protect that.Eight years later, when he was a young man of 18, Benki left the forest for the first time. He went 3,000 miles on an odyssey to Rio to the Earth Summit to tell the world what was happening in his tiny, little corner. And he went because he hoped the world would listen. Some did, not everybody. But if you can imagine this young man with his headdress and his flowing robe, learning a new language, Portuguese, not to mention English, going to Rio, building a bridge to reach out to people he'd never met before \u2014 a pretty hostile world. But he wasn't dismayed.Benki came back to his village full of ideas \u2014 new technologies, new research, new ways of understanding what was going on. Since that time, he's continued to work with his people, and not only the Ashaninka Nation, but all the peoples of the Amazon and beyond. He's built schools to teach children to care for the forest. Together, he's led the reforestation of over 25 percent of the land that had been destroyed by the loggers. He's created a cooperative to help people diversify their livelihoods. And he's brought the internet and satellite technology to the forest \u2014 both so that people themselves could monitor the deforestation, but also that he could speak from the forest to the rest of the world. If you were to meet Benki and ask him, \"Why are you doing this? Why are you putting yourself at risk? Why are you making yourself vulnerable to what is often a hostile world?\" he would tell you, as he told me, \"I asked myself,\" he said, \"What did my grandparents and my great-grandparents do to protect the forest for me? And what am I doing?\"So when I think of that, I wonder what our grandchildren and our great-grandchildren, when they ask themselves that question, I wonder how they will answer. For me, the world is veering towards a future we don't much want when we really think about it deep inside. It's a future we don't know the details of, but it's a future that has signs, just like Benki saw the signs around him. We know we are running out of what we need. We're running out of fresh water. We're running out of fossil fuels. We're running out of land. We know climate change is going to affect all of us. We don't know how, but we know it will. And we know that there will be more of us than ever before \u2014 five times as many people in 40 years than 60 years ago. We are running out of what we need. And we also know that the world has changed in other ways, that since 1960 there are one-third as many new countries that exist as independent entities on the planet. Egos, systems of government \u2014 figuring it out \u2014 massive change. And in addition to that, we know that five other really big countries are going to have a say in the future, a say we haven't even really started to hear yet \u2014 China, India, Russia, South Africa and Benki's own Brazil, where Benki got his civil rights only in the 1988 constitution.But you know all that. You know more than Benki knew when he left his forest and went 3,000 miles. You also know that we can't just keep doing what we've always done, because we'll get the results we've always gotten. And this reminds me of something I understand Lord Salisbury said to Queen Victoria over a hundred years ago, when she was pressing him, \"Please change.\" He said, \"Change? Why change? Things are bad enough as they are.\" We have to change. It's imperative to me, when I look around the world, that we need to change ourselves. We need new models of what it means to be a leader. We need new models of being a leader and a human in the world.I started life as a banker. Now I don't admit to that to anybody but my very close friends. But for the past eight years, I've done something completely different. My work has taken me around the world, where I've had the real privilege of meeting people like Benki and many others who are making change happen in their communities \u2014 people who see the world differently, who are asking different questions, who have different answers, who understand the filters that they wear when they go out into the world.This is Sanghamitra. Sanghamitra comes from Bangalore. I met Sanghamitra eight years ago when I was in Bangalore organizing a workshop with leaders of different NGO's working in some of the hardest aspects of society. Sanghamitra didn't start life as a leader of an NGO, she started her career as university professor, teaching English literature. But she realized that she was much too detached from the world doing that. She loved it, but she was too detached. And so in 1993, a long time ago, she decided to start a new organization called Samraksha focused on one of the hardest areas, one of the hardest issues in India \u2014 anywhere in the world at the time \u2014 HIV/AIDS. Since that time, Samraksha has grown from strength to strength and is now one of the leading health NGO's in India. But if you just think about the state of the world and knowledge of HIV/AIDS in 1993 \u2014 in India at that time it was skyrocketing and nobody understood why, and everyone was actually very, very afraid. Today there are still three million HIV-positive people in India. That's the second largest population in the world.When I asked Sanghamitra, \"How did you get from English literature to HIV/AIDS?\" not an obvious path, she said to me, \"It's all connected. Literature makes one sensitive, sensitive to people, to their dreams and to their ideas.\" Since that time, under her leadership, Samraksha has been a pioneer in all fields related to HIV/AIDS. They have respite homes, the first, the first care centers, the first counseling services \u2014 and not just in urban, 7-million-population Bangalore, but in the hardest to reach villages in the state of Karnataka. Even that wasn't enough. She wanted to change policy at the government level. 10 of their programs that she pioneered are now government policy and funded by the government. They take care of 20,000-odd people today in over 1,000 villages around Karnataka.She works with people like Murali Krishna. Murali Krishna comes from one of those villages. He lost his wife to AIDS a couple of years ago, and he's HIV-positive. But he saw the work, the care, the compassion that Sanghamitra and her team brought to the village, and he wanted to be part of it. He's a Leaders' Quest fellow, and that helps him with his work. They've pioneered a different approach to villages. Instead of handing out information in pamphlets, as is so often the case, they bring theater troupes, songs, music, dance. And they sit around, and they talk about dreams.Sanghamitra told me just last week \u2014 she had just come back from two weeks in the villages, and she had a real breakthrough. They were sitting in a circle, talking about the dreams for the village. And the young women in the village spoke up and said, \"We've changed our dream. Our dream is for our partners, our husbands, not to be given to us because of a horoscope, but to be given to us because they've been tested for HIV.\" If you are lucky enough to meet Sanghamitra and ask her why and how, how have you achieved so much? She would look at you and very quietly, very softly say, \"It just happened. It's the spirit inside.\"This is Dr. Fan Jianchuan. Jianchuan comes from Sichuan Province in southwest China. He was born in 1957, and you can imagine what his childhood looked like and felt like, and what his life has been like over the last 50 tumultuous years. He's been a soldier, a teacher, a politician, a vice-mayor and a business man. But if you sat down and asked him, \"Who are you really, and what do you do?\" He would tell you, \"I'm a collector, and I curate a museum.\" I was lucky; I had heard about him for years, and I finally met him earlier this year at his museum in Chengdu.He's been a collector all of his life, starting when he was four or five in the early 1960's. Now, just think of the early 1960's in China. Over a lifetime, through everything, through the Cultural Revolution and everything afterward, he's kept collecting, so that he now has over eight million pieces in his museums documenting contemporary Chinese history. These are pieces that you won't find anywhere else in the world, in part because they document parts of history Chinese choose to forget. For example, he's got over one million pieces documenting the Sino-Japanese War, a war that's not talked about in China very much and whose heroes are not honored. Why did he do all this? Because he thought a nation should never repeat the mistakes of the past.So, from commissioning slightly larger than life bronze statues of the heroes of the Sino-Japanese War, including those Chinese who then fought with each other and left mainland China to go to Taiwan, to commemorating all the unknown, ordinary soldiers who survived, by asking them to take prints of their hands, he is making sure \u2014 one man is making sure \u2014 that history is not forgotten. But it's not just Chinese heroes he cares about. This building contains the world's largest collection of documents and artifacts commemorating the U.S. role in fighting on the Chinese side in that long war \u2014 the Flying Tigers. He has nine other buildings \u2014 that are already open to the public \u2014 filled to the rafters with artifacts documenting contemporary Chinese history. Two of the most sensitive buildings include a lifetime of collection about the Cultural Revolution, a period that actually most Chinese would prefer to forget. But he doesn't want his nation ever to forget.These people inspire me, and they inspire me because they show us what is possible when you change the way you look at the world, change the way you look at your place in the world. They looked outside, and then they changed what was on the inside. They didn't go to business school. They didn't read a manual, \"How to Be a Good Leader in 10 Easy Steps.\" But they have qualities we'd all recognize. They have drive, passion, commitment. They've gone away from what they did before, and they've gone to something they didn't know. They've tried to connect worlds they didn't know existed before. They've built bridges, and they've walked across them. They have a sense of the great arc of time and their tiny place in it. They know people have come before them and will follow them. And they know that they're part of a whole, that they depend on other people. It's not about them, they know that, but it has to start with them. And they have humility. It just happens.But we know it doesn't just happen, don't we? We know it takes a lot to make it happen, and we know the direction the world is going in. So I think we need succession planning on a global basis. We can't wait for the next generation, the new joiners, to come in and learn how to be the good leaders we need. I think it has to start with us. And we know, just like they knew, how hard it is. But the good news is that we don't have to figure it out as we go along; we have models, we have examples, like Benki and Sanghamitra and Jianchuan. We can look at what they've done, if we look. We can learn from what they've learned. We can change the way we see ourselves in the world. And if we're lucky, we can change the way our great-grandchildren will answer Benki's question.Thank you.(Applause)", "id": 692, "subtitle":

00:03:54.958\nHe's built schools\n\n00:03:54.958 --> 00:03:56.958\nto teach children to care for the forest.\n\n00:03:56.958 --> 00:03:58.958\nTogether, he's led the reforestation\n\n00:03:58.958 --> 00:04:00.958\nof over 25 percent of the land\n\n00:04:00.958 --> 00:04:03.958\nthat had been destroyed by the loggers.\n\n00:04:03.958 --> 00:04:05.958\nHe's created a cooperative\n\n00:04:05.958 --> 00:04:08.958\nto help people diversify their livelihoods.\n\n00:04:08.958 --> 00:04:10.958\nAnd he's brought the internet and satellite technology\n\n00:04:10.958 --> 00:04:12.958\nto the forest --\n\n00:04:12.958 --> 00:04:14.958\nboth so that people themselves\n\n00:04:14.958 --> 00:04:16.958\ncould monitor the deforestation,\n\n00:04:16.958 --> 00:04:18.958\nbut also that he could speak from the forest\n\n00:04:18.958 --> 00:04:20.958\nto the rest of the world.\n\n00:04:21.958 --> 00:04:23.958\nIf you were to meet Benki\n\n00:04:23.958 --> 00:04:26.958\nand ask him, \"Why are you doing this?\n\n00:04:26.958 --> 00:04:28.958\nWhy are you putting yourself at risk?\n\n00:04:28.958 --> 00:04:30.958\nWhy are you making yourself vulnerable\n\n00:04:30.958 --> 00:04:33.958\nto what is often a hostile world?\"\n\n00:04:33.958 --> 00:04:35.958\nhe would tell you,\n\n00:04:35.958 --> 00:04:37.958\nas he told me,\n\n00:04:37.958 --> 00:04:40.958\n\"I asked myself,\" he said,\n\n00:04:40.958 --> 00:04:43.958\n\"What did my grandparents and my great-grandparents do\n\n00:04:43.958 --> 00:04:46.958\nto protect the forest for me?\n\n00:04:46.958 --> 00:04:49.958\nAnd what am I doing?\"\n\n00:04:49.958 --> 00:04:51.958\nSo when I think of that,\n\n00:04:51.958 --> 00:04:54.958\nI wonder what our grandchildren\n\n00:04:54.958 --> 00:04:56.958\nand our great-grandchildren,\n\n00:04:56.958 --> 00:04:58.958\nwhen they ask themselves that question,\n\n00:04:58.958 --> 00:05:01.958\nI wonder how they will answer.\n\n00:05:01.958 --> 00:05:03.958\nFor me, the world is veering\n\n00:05:03.958 --> 00:05:06.958\ntowards a future we don't much want\n\n00:05:06.958 --> 00:05:09.958\nwhen we really think about it deep inside.\n\n00:05:09.958 --> 00:05:12.958\nIt's a future we don't know the details of,\n\n00:05:12.958 --> 00:05:14.958\nbut it's a future that has signs,\n\n00:05:14.958 --> 00:05:17.958\njust like Benki saw the signs around him.\n\n00:05:18.958 --> 00:05:21.958\nWe know we are running out of what we need.\n\n00:05:21.958 --> 00:05:23.958\nWe're running out of fresh water.\n\n00:05:23.958 --> 00:05:25.958\nWe're running out of fossil fuels.\n\n00:05:25.958 --> 00:05:27.958\nWe're running out of land.\n\n00:05:27.958 --> 00:05:30.958\nWe know climate change is going to affect all of us.\n\n00:05:30.958 --> 00:05:33.958\nWe don't know how, but we know it will.\n\n00:05:33.958 --> 00:05:36.958\nAnd we know that there will be more of us than ever before --\n\n00:05:36.958 --> 00:05:38.958\nfive times as many people in 40 years\n\n00:05:38.958 --> 00:05:40.958\nthan 60 years ago.\n\n00:05:40.958 --> 00:05:43.958\nWe are running out of what we need.\n\n00:05:43.958 --> 00:05:45.958\nAnd we also know\n\n00:05:45.958 --> 00:05:48.958\nthat the world has changed in other ways,\n\n00:05:48.958 --> 00:05:50.958\nthat since 1960\n\n00:05:50.958 --> 00:05:53.958\nthere are one-third as many new countries\n\n00:05:53.958 --> 00:05:56.958\nthat exist as independent entities on the planet.\n\n00:05:56.958 --> 00:05:58.958\nEgos, systems of government --\n\n00:05:58.958 --> 00:06:00.958\nfiguring it out --\n\n00:06:00.958 --> 00:06:02.958\nmassive change.\n\n00:06:02.958 --> 00:06:04.958\nAnd in addition to that,\n\n00:06:04.958 --> 00:06:06.958\nwe know that five other really big countries\n\n00:06:06.958 --> 00:06:08.958\nare going to have a say in the future,\n\n00:06:08.958 --> 00:06:11.958\na say we haven't even really started to hear yet --\n\n00:06:12.958 --> 00:06:14.958\nChina, India,\n\n00:06:14.958 --> 00:06:17.958\nRussia, South Africa\n\n00:06:17.958 --> 00:06:20.958\nand Benki's own Brazil,\n\n00:06:20.958 --> 00:06:22.958\nwhere Benki got his civil rights\n\n00:06:22.958 --> 00:06:25.958\nonly in the 1988 constitution.\n\n00:06:25.958 --> 00:06:27.958\nBut you know all that.\n\n00:06:27.958 --> 00:06:29.958\nYou know more than Benki knew when he left his forest\n\n00:06:29.958 --> 00:06:32.958\nand went 3,000 miles.\n\n00:06:32.958 --> 00:06:34.958\nYou also know\n\n00:06:34.958 --> 00:06:36.958\nthat we can't just keep doing what we've always done,\n\n00:06:36.958 --> 00:06:38.958\nbecause we'll get the results\n\n00:06:38.958 --> 00:06:40.958\nwe've always gotten.\n\n00:06:40.958 --> 00:06:42.958\nAnd this reminds me of something I understand\n\n00:06:42.958 --> 00:06:45.958\nLord Salisbury said to Queen Victoria over a hundred years ago,\n\n00:06:45.958 --> 00:06:48.958\nwhen she was pressing him, \"Please change.\"\n\n00:06:48.958 --> 00:06:50.958\nHe said, \"Change?\n\n00:06:50.958 --> 00:06:53.958\nWhy change?\n\n00:06:53.958 --> 00:06:56.958\nThings are bad enough as they are.\"\n\n00:06:58.958 --> 00:07:01.958\nWe have to change.\n\n00:07:01.958 --> 00:07:04.958\nIt's imperative to me, when I look around the world,\n\n00:07:04.958 --> 00:07:07.958\nthat we need to change ourselves.\n\n00:07:07.958 --> 00:07:10.958\nWe need new models of what it means to be a leader.\n\n00:07:10.958 --> 00:07:12.958\nWe need new models\n\n00:07:12.958 --> 00:07:15.958\nof being a leader and a human in the world.\n\n00:07:16.958 --> 00:07:19.958\nI started life as a banker.\n\n00:07:19.958 --> 00:07:21.958\nNow I don't admit to that\n\n00:07:21.958 --> 00:07:24.958\nto anybody but my very close friends.\n\n00:07:24.958 --> 00:07:26.958\nBut for the past eight years,\n\n00:07:26.958 --> 00:07:28.958\nI've done something completely different.\n\n00:07:28.958 --> 00:07:30.958\nMy work has taken me around the world,\n\n00:07:30.958 --> 00:07:32.958\nwhere I've had the real privilege\n\n00:07:32.958 --> 00:07:35.958\nof meeting people like Benki\n\n00:07:35.958 --> 00:07:37.958\nand many others who are making change happen\n\n00:07:37.958 --> 00:07:39.958\nin their communities --\n\n00:07:39.958 --> 00:07:41.958\npeople who see the world differently,\n\n00:07:41.958 --> 00:07:43.958\nwho are asking different questions,\n\n00:07:43.958 --> 00:07:45.958\nwho have different answers,\n\n00:07:45.958 --> 00:07:48.958\nwho understand the filters that they wear\n\n00:07:48.958 --> 00:07:50.958\nwhen they go out into the world.\n\n00:07:50.958 --> 00:07:52.958\nThis is Sanghamitra.\n\n00:07:52.958 --> 00:07:54.958\nSanghamitra comes from Bangalore.\n\n00:07:54.958 --> 00:07:57.958\nI met Sanghamitra eight years ago\n\n00:07:57.958 --> 00:07:59.958\nwhen I was in Bangalore\n\n00:07:59.958 --> 00:08:02.958\norganizing a workshop with leaders of different NGO's\n\n00:08:02.958 --> 00:08:05.958\nworking in some of the hardest aspects of society.\n\n00:08:06.958 --> 00:08:08.958\nSanghamitra didn't start life\n\n00:08:08.958 --> 00:08:10.958\nas a leader of an NGO,\n\n00:08:10.958 --> 00:08:13.958\nshe started her career as university professor,\n\n00:08:13.958 --> 00:08:15.958\nteaching English literature.\n\n00:08:15.958 --> 00:08:18.958\nBut she realized that she was much too detached from the world doing that.\n\n00:08:18.958 --> 00:08:21.958\nShe loved it, but she was too detached.\n\n00:08:21.958 --> 00:08:23.958\nAnd so in 1993,\n\n00:08:23.958 --> 00:08:25.958\na long time ago,\n\n00:08:25.958 --> 00:08:28.958\nshe decided to start a new organization\n\n00:08:28.958 --> 00:08:30.958\ncalled Samraksha\n\n00:08:30.958 --> 00:08:32.958\nfocused on one of the hardest areas,\n\n00:08:32.958 --> 00:08:34.958\none of the hardest issues in India --\n\n00:08:34.958 --> 00:08:36.958\nanywhere in the world at the time --\n\n00:08:36.958 --> 00:08:38.958\nHIV/AIDS.\n\n00:08:38.958 --> 00:08:40.958\nSince that time, Samraksha has grown\n\n00:08:40.958 --> 00:08:42.958\nfrom strength to strength\n\n00:08:42.958 --> 00:08:45.958\nand is now one of the leading health NGO's in India.\n\n00:08:45.958 --> 00:08:48.958\nBut if you just think about the state of the world\n\n00:08:48.958 --> 00:08:50.958\nand knowledge of HIV/AIDS\n\n00:08:50.958 --> 00:08:52.958\nin 1993 --\n\n00:08:52.958 --> 00:08:54.958\nin India at that time it was skyrocketing\n\n00:08:54.958 --> 00:08:56.958\nand nobody understood why,\n\n00:08:56.958 --> 00:08:59.958\nand everyone was actually very, very afraid.\n\n00:08:59.958 --> 00:09:01.958\nToday there are still three million\n\n00:09:01.958 --> 00:09:04.958\nHIV-positive people in India.\n\n00:09:04.958 --> 00:09:07.958\nThat's the second largest population in the world.\n\n00:09:08.958 --> 00:09:10.958\nWhen I asked Sanghamitra,\n\n00:09:10.958 --> 00:09:12.958\n\"How did you get from English literature\n\n00:09:12.958 --> 00:09:14.958\nto HIV/AIDS?\"\n\n00:09:14.958 --> 00:09:16.958\nnot an obvious path,\n\n00:09:16.958 --> 00:09:18.958\nshe said to me,\n\n00:09:18.958 --> 00:09:21.958\n\"It's all connected.\n\n00:09:21.958 --> 00:09:23.958\nLiterature makes one sensitive,\n\n00:09:23.958 --> 00:09:25.958\nsensitive to people,\n\n00:09:25.958 --> 00:09:27.958\nto their dreams and to their ideas.\"\n\n00:09:27.958 --> 00:09:29.958\nSince that time, under her leadership,\n\n00:09:29.958 --> 00:09:31.958\nSamraksha has been a pioneer\n\n00:09:31.958 --> 00:09:33.958\nin all fields related\n\n00:09:33.958 --> 00:09:35.958\nto HIV/AIDS.\n\n00:09:35.958 --> 00:09:37.958\nThey have respite homes, the first,\n\n00:09:37.958 --> 00:09:39.958\nthe first care centers,\n\n00:09:39.958 --> 00:09:41.958\nthe first counseling services --\n\n00:09:41.958 --> 00:09:44.958\nand not just in urban, 7-million-population Bangalore,\n\n00:09:44.958 --> 00:09:46.958\nbut in the hardest to reach villages\n\n00:09:46.958 --> 00:09:48.958\nin the state of Karnataka.\n\n00:09:48.958 --> 00:09:50.958\nEven that wasn't enough.\n\n00:09:50.958 --> 00:09:53.958\nShe wanted to change policy at the government level.\n\n00:09:53.958 --> 00:09:55.958\n10 of their programs that she pioneered\n\n00:09:55.958 --> 00:09:58.958\nare now government policy and funded by the government.\n\n00:09:59.958 --> 00:10:02.958\nThey take care of 20,000-odd people today\n\n00:10:02.958 --> 00:10:05.958\nin over 1,000 villages around Karnataka.\n\n00:10:05.958 --> 00:10:08.958\nShe works with people like Murali Krishna.\n\n00:10:08.958 --> 00:10:11.958\nMurali Krishna comes from one of those villages.\n\n00:10:11.958 --> 00:10:14.958\nHe lost his wife to AIDS a couple of years ago,\n\n00:10:14.958 --> 00:10:16.958\nand he's HIV-positive.\n\n00:10:16.958 --> 00:10:18.958\nBut he saw the work, the care,\n\n00:10:18.958 --> 00:10:20.958\nthe compassion\n\n00:10:20.958 --> 00:10:23.958\nthat Sanghamitra and her team brought to the village,\n\n00:10:23.958 --> 00:10:25.958\nand he wanted to be part of it.\n\n00:10:25.958 --> 00:10:28.958\nHe's a Leaders' Quest fellow, and that helps him with his work.\n\n00:10:28.958 --> 00:10:30.958\nThey've pioneered a different approach to villages.\n\n00:10:30.958 --> 00:10:32.958\nInstead of handing out information in pamphlets,\n\n00:10:32.958 --> 00:10:34.958\nas is so often the case,\n\n00:10:34.958 --> 00:10:36.958\nthey bring theater troupes,\n\n00:10:36.958 --> 00:10:39.958\nsongs, music, dance.\n\n00:10:39.958 --> 00:10:41.958\nAnd they sit around,\n\n00:10:41.958 --> 00:10:43.958\nand they talk about dreams.\n\n00:10:43.958 --> 00:10:45.958\nSanghamitra told me just last week --\n\n00:10:45.958 --> 00:10:48.958\nshe had just come back from two weeks in the villages,\n\n00:10:48.958 --> 00:10:50.958\nand she had a real breakthrough.\n\n00:10:50.958 --> 00:10:53.958\nThey were sitting in a circle, talking about the dreams for the village.\n\n00:10:53.958 --> 00:10:56.958\nAnd the young women in the village\n\n00:10:56.958 --> 00:10:59.958\nspoke up and said, \"We've changed our dream.\n\n00:10:59.958 --> 00:11:01.958\nOur dream\n\n00:11:01.958 --> 00:11:03.958\nis for our partners, our husbands,\n\n00:11:03.958 --> 00:11:06.958\nnot to be given to us because of a horoscope,\n\n00:11:06.958 --> 00:11:08.958\nbut to be given to us\n\n00:11:08.958 --> 00:11:11.958\nbecause they've been tested for HIV.\"\n\n00:11:11.958 --> 00:11:14.958\nIf you are lucky enough to meet Sanghamitra\n\n00:11:14.958 --> 00:11:17.958\nand ask her why and how,\n\n00:11:17.958 --> 00:11:20.958\nhow have you achieved so much?\n\n00:11:21.958 --> 00:11:23.958\nShe would look at you\n\n00:11:23.958 --> 00:11:26.958\nand very quietly, very softly say,\n\n00:11:26.958 --> 00:11:29.958\n\"It just happened.\n\n00:11:29.958 --> 00:11:32.958\nIt's the spirit inside.\"\n\n00:11:33.958 --> 00:11:36.958\nThis is Dr. Fan Jianchuan.\n\n00:11:36.958 --> 00:11:38.958\nJianchuan comes from Sichuan Province\n\n00:11:38.958 --> 00:11:40.958\nin southwest China.\n\n00:11:40.958 --> 00:11:42.958\nHe was born in 1957,\n\n00:11:42.958 --> 00:11:44.958\nand you can imagine what his childhood\n\n00:11:44.958 --> 00:11:46.958\nlooked like and felt like,\n\n00:11:46.958 --> 00:11:48.958\nand what his life has been like\n\n00:11:48.958 --> 00:11:51.958\nover the last 50 tumultuous years.\n\n00:11:51.958 --> 00:11:53.958\nHe's been a soldier, a teacher,\n\n00:11:53.958 --> 00:11:55.958\na politician, a vice-mayor\n\n00:11:55.958 --> 00:11:57.958\nand a business man.\n\n00:11:57.958 --> 00:12:00.958\nBut if you sat down and asked him, \"Who are you really,\n\n00:12:00.958 --> 00:12:02.958\nand what do you do?\"\n\n00:12:02.958 --> 00:12:05.958\nHe would tell you, \"I'm a collector,\n\n00:12:05.958 --> 00:12:07.958\nand I curate a museum.\"\n\n00:12:07.958 --> 00:12:09.958\nI was lucky; I had heard about him for years,\n\n00:12:09.958 --> 00:12:11.958\nand I finally met him earlier this year\n\n00:12:11.958 --> 00:12:14.958\nat his museum in Chengdu.\n\n00:12:14.958 --> 00:12:17.958\nHe's been a collector all of his life,\n\n00:12:17.958 --> 00:12:20.958\nstarting when he was four or five in the early 1960's.\n\n00:12:20.958 --> 00:12:23.958\nNow, just think of the early 1960's in China.\n\n00:12:23.958 --> 00:12:26.958\nOver a lifetime, through everything,\n\n00:12:26.958 --> 00:12:29.958\nthrough the Cultural Revolution and everything afterward,\n\n00:12:29.958 --> 00:12:31.958\nhe's kept collecting,\n\n00:12:31.958 --> 00:12:33.958\nso that he now has over eight million pieces\n\n00:12:33.958 --> 00:12:35.958\nin his museums\n\n00:12:35.958 --> 00:12:38.958\ndocumenting contemporary Chinese history.\n\n00:12:39.958 --> 00:12:42.958\nThese are pieces that you won't find anywhere else in the world,\n\n00:12:42.958 --> 00:12:45.958\nin part because they document parts of history\n\n00:12:45.958 --> 00:12:48.958\nChinese choose to forget.\n\n00:12:48.958 --> 00:12:51.958\nFor example, he's got over one million pieces\n\n00:12:51.958 --> 00:12:54.958\ndocumenting the Sino-Japanese War,\n\n00:12:54.958 --> 00:12:56.958\na war that's not talked about in China very much\n\n00:12:56.958 --> 00:12:59.958\nand whose heroes are not honored.\n\n00:12:59.958 --> 00:13:01.958\nWhy did he do all this?\n\n00:13:01.958 --> 00:13:04.958\nBecause he thought\n\n00:13:04.958 --> 00:13:07.958\na nation should never repeat the mistakes of the past.\n\n00:13:07.958 --> 00:13:10.958\nSo, from commissioning\n\n00:13:10.958 --> 00:13:12.958\nslightly larger than life bronze statues\n\n00:13:12.958 --> 00:13:15.958\nof the heroes of the Sino-Japanese War,\n\n00:13:15.958 --> 00:13:17.958\nincluding those Chinese\n\n00:13:17.958 --> 00:13:19.958\nwho then fought with each other\n\n00:13:19.958 --> 00:13:22.958\nand left mainland China to go to Taiwan,\n\n00:13:22.958 --> 00:13:25.958\nto commemorating all the unknown,\n\n00:13:25.958 --> 00:13:28.958\nordinary soldiers who survived,\n\n00:13:28.958 --> 00:13:31.958\nby asking them to take prints of their hands,\n\n00:13:31.958 --> 00:13:34.958\nhe is making sure -- one man is making sure --\n\n00:13:34.958 --> 00:13:36.958\nthat history is not forgotten.\n\n00:13:36.958 --> 00:13:39.958\nBut it's not just Chinese heroes he cares about.\n\n00:13:39.958 --> 00:13:42.958\nThis building contains the world's largest collection\n\n00:13:42.958 --> 00:13:44.958\nof documents and artifacts\n\n00:13:44.958 --> 00:13:46.958\ncommemorating the U.S. role\n\n00:13:46.958 --> 00:13:48.958\nin fighting on the Chinese side\n\n00:13:48.958 --> 00:13:50.958\nin that long war --\n\n00:13:50.958 --> 00:13:53.958\nthe Flying Tigers.\n\n00:13:53.958 --> 00:13:55.958\nHe has nine other buildings --\n\n00:13:55.958 --> 00:13:57.958\nthat are already open to the public --\n\n00:13:57.958 --> 00:14:00.958\nfilled to the rafters with artifacts\n\n00:14:00.958 --> 00:14:03.958\ndocumenting contemporary Chinese history.\n\n00:14:04.958 --> 00:14:06.958\nTwo of the most sensitive buildings\n\n00:14:06.958 --> 00:14:08.958\ninclude a lifetime of collection\n\n00:14:08.958 --> 00:14:10.958\nabout the Cultural Revolution,\n\n00:14:10.958 --> 00:14:12.958\na period that actually most Chinese\n\n00:14:12.958 --> 00:14:14.958\nwould prefer to forget.\n\n00:14:14.958 --> 00:14:16.958\nBut he doesn't want his nation\n\n00:14:16.958 --> 00:14:19.958\never to forget.\n\n00:14:19.958 --> 00:14:21.958\nThese people inspire me,\n\n00:14:21.958 --> 00:14:24.958\nand they inspire me because they show us\n\n00:14:24.958 --> 00:14:26.958\nwhat is possible when you change the way\n\n00:14:26.958 --> 00:14:28.958\nyou look at the world,\n\n00:14:28.958 --> 00:14:31.958\nchange the way you look at your place in the world.\n\n00:14:32.958 --> 00:14:34.958\nThey looked outside,\n\n00:14:34.958 --> 00:14:36.958\nand then they changed what was on the inside.\n\n00:14:36.958 --> 00:14:38.958\nThey didn't go to business school.\n\n00:14:38.958 --> 00:14:40.958\nThey didn't read a manual, \"How to Be a Good Leader\n\n00:14:40.958 --> 00:14:42.958\nin 10 Easy Steps.\"\n\n00:14:43.958 --> 00:14:46.958\nBut they have qualities we'd all recognize.\n\n00:14:46.958 --> 00:14:49.958\nThey have drive, passion, commitment.\n\n00:14:49.958 --> 00:14:51.958\nThey've gone away\n\n00:14:51.958 --> 00:14:53.958\nfrom what they did before,\n\n00:14:53.958 --> 00:14:55.958\nand they've gone\n\n00:14:55.958 --> 00:14:57.958\nto something they didn't know.\n\n00:14:57.958 --> 00:15:00.958\nThey've tried to connect worlds\n\n00:15:00.958 --> 00:15:02.958\nthey didn't know existed before.\n\n00:15:02.958 --> 00:15:05.958\nThey've built bridges, and they've walked across them.\n\n00:15:05.958 --> 00:15:07.958\nThey have a sense of the great arc of time\n\n00:15:07.958 --> 00:15:09.958\nand their tiny place in it.\n\n00:15:09.958 --> 00:15:11.958\nThey know people have come before them\n\n00:15:11.958 --> 00:15:13.958\nand will follow them.\n\n00:15:14.958 --> 00:15:16.958\nAnd they know that they're part of a whole,\n\n00:15:16.958 --> 00:15:18.958\nthat they depend on other people.\n\n00:15:18.958 --> 00:15:20.958\nIt's not about them, they know that,\n\n00:15:20.958 --> 00:15:22.958\nbut it has to start with them.\n\n00:15:22.958 --> 00:15:24.958\nAnd they have humility.\n\n00:15:24.958 --> 00:15:26.958\nIt just happens.\n\n00:15:28.958 --> 00:15:31.958\nBut we know it doesn't just happen, don't we?\n\n00:15:31.958 --> 00:15:33.958\nWe know it takes a lot to make it happen,\n\n00:15:33.958 --> 00:15:36.958\nand we know the direction the world is going in.\n\n00:15:36.958 --> 00:15:39.958\nSo I think we need succession planning\n\n00:15:39.958 --> 00:15:42.958\non a global basis.\n\n00:15:42.958 --> 00:15:45.958\nWe can't wait for the next generation, the new joiners,\n\n00:15:45.958 --> 00:15:47.958\nto come in and learn how to be the good leaders we need.\n\n00:15:47.958 --> 00:15:49.958\nI think it has to start with us.\n\n00:15:49.958 --> 00:15:51.958\nAnd we know, just like they knew,\n\n00:15:51.958 --> 00:15:54.958\nhow hard it is.\n\n00:15:54.958 --> 00:15:57.958\nBut the good news is that we don't have to figure it out as we go along;\n\n00:15:57.958 --> 00:16:00.958\nwe have models, we have examples,\n\n00:16:00.958 --> 00:16:03.958\nlike Benki and Sanghamitra and Jianchuan.\n\n00:16:03.958 --> 00:16:06.958\nWe can look at what they've done, if we look.\n\n00:16:06.958 --> 00:16:09.958\nWe can learn from what they've learned.\n\n00:16:09.958 --> 00:16:13.958\nWe can change the way we see ourselves in the world.\n\n00:16:13.958 --> 00:16:15.958\nAnd if we're lucky,\n\n00:16:15.958 --> 00:16:17.958\nwe can change the way\n\n00:16:17.958 --> 00:16:19.958\nour great-grandchildren\n\n00:16:19.958 --> 00:16:22.958\nwill answer Benki's question.\n\n00:16:22.958 --> 00:16:24.958\nThank you.\n\n00:16:24.958 --> 00:16:26.958\n(Applause)"}, {"title": "East vs. West -- the myths that mystify", "duration": "1106", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/devdutt_pattanaik", "transcript": "To understand the business of mythology and what a Chief Belief Officer is supposed to do, you have to hear a story of Ganesha, the elephant-headed god who is the scribe of storytellers, and his brother, the athletic warlord of the gods, Kartikeya. The two brothers one day decided to go on a race, three times around the world. Kartikeya leapt on his peacock and flew around the continents and the mountains and the oceans. He went around once, he went around twice, he went around thrice. But his brother, Ganesha, simply walked around his parents once, twice, thrice, and said, \"I won.\" \"How come?\" said Kartikeya. And Ganesha said, \"You went around 'the world.' I went around 'my world.'\" What matters more?If you understand the difference between 'the world' and 'my world,' you understand the difference between logos and mythos. 'The world' is objective, logical, universal, factual, scientific. 'My world' is subjective. It's emotional. It's personal. It's perceptions, thoughts, feelings, dreams. It is the belief system that we carry. It's the myth that we live in.'The world' tells us how the world functions, how the sun rises, how we are born. 'My world' tells us why the sun rises, why we were born. Every culture is trying to understand itself: \"Why do we exist?\" And every culture comes up with its own understanding of life, its own customized version of mythology.Culture is a reaction to nature, and this understanding of our ancestors is transmitted generation from generation in the form of stories, symbols and rituals, which are always indifferent to rationality. And so, when you study it, you realize that different people of the world have a different understanding of the world. Different people see things differently \u2014 different viewpoints.There is my world and there is your world, and my world is always better than your world, because my world, you see, is rational and yours is superstition. Yours is faith. Yours is illogical. This is the root of the clash of civilizations. It took place, once, in 326 B.C. on the banks of a river called the Indus, now in Pakistan. This river lends itself to India's name. India. Indus.Alexander, a young Macedonian, met there what he called a \"gymnosophist,\" which means \"the naked, wise man.\" We don't know who he was. Perhaps he was a Jain monk, like Bahubali over here, the Gomateshwara Bahubali whose image is not far from Mysore. Or perhaps he was just a yogi who was sitting on a rock, staring at the sky and the sun and the moon.Alexander asked, \"What are you doing?\" and the gymnosophist answered, \"I'm experiencing nothingness.\" Then the gymnosophist asked, \"What are you doing?\" and Alexander said, \"I am conquering the world.\" And they both laughed. Each one thought that the other was a fool. The gymnosophist said, \"Why is he conquering the world? It's pointless.\" And Alexander thought, \"Why is he sitting around, doing nothing? What a waste of a life.\"To understand this difference in viewpoints, we have to understand the subjective truth of Alexander \u2014 his myth, and the mythology that constructed it. Alexander's mother, his parents, his teacher Aristotle told him the story of Homer's \"Iliad.\" They told him of a great hero called Achilles, who, when he participated in battle, victory was assured, but when he withdrew from the battle, defeat was inevitable. \"Achilles was a man who could shape history, a man of destiny, and this is what you should be, Alexander.\" That's what he heard.\"What should you not be? You should not be Sisyphus, who rolls a rock up a mountain all day only to find the boulder rolled down at night. Don't live a life which is monotonous, mediocre, meaningless. Be spectacular! \u2014 like the Greek heroes, like Jason, who went across the sea with the Argonauts and fetched the Golden Fleece. Be spectacular like Theseus, who entered the labyrinth and killed the bull-headed Minotaur. When you play in a race, win! \u2014 because when you win, the exhilaration of victory is the closest you will come to the ambrosia of the gods.\"Because, you see, the Greeks believed you live only once, and when you die, you have to cross the River Styx. And if you have lived an extraordinary life, you will be welcomed to Elysium, or what the French call \"Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es\" \u2014 (Laughter) \u2014 the heaven of the heroes.But these are not the stories that the gymnosophist heard. He heard a very different story. He heard of a man called Bharat, after whom India is called Bh\u0101rata. Bharat also conquered the world. And then he went to the top-most peak of the greatest mountain of the center of the world called Meru. And he wanted to hoist his flag to say, \"I was here first.\" But when he reached the mountain peak, he found the peak covered with countless flags of world-conquerors before him, each one claiming \"'I was here first' ... that's what I thought until I came here.\" And suddenly, in this canvas of infinity, Bharat felt insignificant. This was the mythology of the gymnosophist.You see, he had heroes, like Ram \u2014 Raghupati Ram and Krishna, Govinda Hari. But they were not two characters on two different adventures. They were two lifetimes of the same hero. When the Ramayana ends the Mahabharata begins. When Ram dies, Krishna is born. When Krishna dies, eventually he will be back as Ram.You see, the Indians also had a river that separates the land of the living from the land of the dead. But you don't cross it once. You go to and fro endlessly. It was called the Vaitarani. You go again and again and again. Because, you see, nothing lasts forever in India, not even death. And so, you have these grand rituals where great images of mother goddesses are built and worshiped for 10 days ... And what do you do at the end of 10 days? You dunk it in the river. Because it has to end. And next year, she will come back. What goes around always comes around, and this rule applies not just to man, but also the gods. You see, the gods have to come back again and again and again as Ram, as Krishna. Not only do they live infinite lives, but the same life is lived infinite times till you get to the point of it all. \"Groundhog Day.\" (Laughter)Two different mythologies. Which is right? Two different mythologies, two different ways of looking at the world. One linear, one cyclical. One believes this is the one and only life. The other believes this is one of many lives. And so, the denominator of Alexander's life was one. So, the value of his life was the sum total of his achievements. The denominator of the gymnosophist's life was infinity. So, no matter what he did, it was always zero. And I believe it is this mythological paradigm that inspired Indian mathematicians to discover the number zero. Who knows?And that brings us to the mythology of business. If Alexander's belief influenced his behavior, if the gymnosophist's belief influences his behavior, then it was bound to influence the business they were in. You see, what is business but the result of how the market behaves and how the organization behaves? And if you look at cultures around the world, all you have to do is understand the mythology and you will see how they behave and how they do business.Take a look. If you live only once, in one-life cultures around the world, you will see an obsession with binary logic, absolute truth, standardization, absoluteness, linear patterns in design. But if you look at cultures which have cyclical and based on infinite lives, you will see a comfort with fuzzy logic, with opinion, with contextual thinking, with everything is relative, sort of \u2014 (Laughter) mostly. (Laughter)You look at art. Look at the ballerina, how linear she is in her performance. And then look at the Indian classical dancer, the Kuchipudi dancer, the Bharatanatyam dancer, curvaceous. (Laughter)And then look at business. Standard business model: vision, mission, values, processes. Sounds very much like the journey through the wilderness to the promised land, with the commandments held by the leader. And if you comply, you will go to heaven.But in India there is no \"the\" promised land. There are many promised lands, depending on your station in society, depending on your stage of life. You see, businesses are not run as institutions, by the idiosyncrasies of individuals. It's always about taste. It's always about my taste.You see, Indian music, for example, does not have the concept of harmony. There is no orchestra conductor. There is one performer standing there, and everybody follows. And you can never replicate that performance twice. It is not about documentation and contract. It's about conversation and faith. It's not about compliance. It's about setting, getting the job done, by bending or breaking the rules \u2014 just look at your Indian people around here, you'll see them smile; they know what it is. (Laughter) And then look at people who have done business in India, you'll see the exasperation on their faces. (Laughter) (Applause)You see, this is what India is today. The ground reality is based on a cyclical world view. So, it's rapidly changing, highly diverse, chaotic, ambiguous, unpredictable. And people are okay with it. And then globalization is taking place. The demands of modern institutional thinking is coming in. Which is rooted in one-life culture. And a clash is going to take place, like on the banks of the Indus. It is bound to happen.I have personally experienced it. I'm trained as a medical doctor. I did not want to study surgery. Don't ask me why. I love mythology too much. I wanted to learn mythology. But there is nowhere you can study. So, I had to teach it to myself. And mythology does not pay, well, until now. (Laughter) So, I had to take up a job. And I worked in the pharma industry. And I worked in the healthcare industry. And I worked as a marketing guy, and a sales guy, and a knowledge guy, and a content guy, and a training guy. I even was a business consultant, doing strategies and tactics. And I would see the exasperation between my American and European colleagues, when they were dealing with India.Example: Please tell us the process to invoice hospitals. Step A. Step B. Step C. Mostly. (Laughter) How do you parameterize \"mostly\"? How do you put it in a nice little software? You can't.I would give my viewpoints to people. But nobody was interested in listening to it, you see, until I met Kishore Biyani of the Future group. You see, he has established the largest retail chain, called Big Bazaar. And there are more than 200 formats, across 50 cities and towns of India. And he was dealing with diverse and dynamic markets. And he knew very intuitively, that best practices, developed in Japan and China and Europe and America will not work in India. He knew that institutional thinking doesn't work in India. Individual thinking does. He had an intuitive understanding of the mythic structure of India.So, he had asked me to be the Chief Belief Officer, and said, \"All I want to do is align belief.\" Sounds so simple. But belief is not measurable. You can't measure it. You can't manage it. So, how do you construct belief? How do you enhance the sensitivity of people to Indian-ness. Even if you are Indian, it is not very explicit, it is not very obvious.So, I tried to work on the standard model of culture, which is, develop stories, symbols and rituals. And I will share one of the rituals with you. You see it is based on the Hindu ritual of Darshan. Hindus don't have the concept of commandments. So, there is nothing right or wrong in what you do in life. So, you're not really sure how you stand in front of God. So, when you go to the temple, all you seek is an audience with God. You want to see God. And you want God to see you, and hence the gods have very large eyes, large unblinking eyes, sometimes made of silver, so they look at you. Because you don't know whether you're right or wrong, and so all you seek is divine empathy. \"Just know where I came from, why I did the Jugaad.\" (Laughter) \"Why did I do the setting, why I don't care for the processes. Just understand me, please.\"And based on this, we created a ritual for leaders. After a leader completes his training and is about to take over the store, we blindfold him, we surround him with the stakeholders, the customer, his family, his team, his boss. You read out his KRA, his KPI, you give him the keys, and then you remove the blindfold. And invariably, you see a tear, because the penny has dropped. He realizes that to succeed, he does not have to be a \"professional,\" he does not have to cut out his emotions, he has to include all these people in his world to succeed, to make them happy, to make the boss happy, to make everyone happy. The customer is happy, because the customer is God.That sensitivity is what we need. Once this belief enters, behavior will happen, business will happen. And it has. So, then we come back to Alexander and to the gymnosophist. And everybody asks me, \"Which is the better way, this way or that way?\" And it's a very dangerous question, because it leads you to the path of fundamentalism and violence. So, I will not answer the question. What I will give you is an Indian answer, the Indian head-shake. (Laughter) (Applause)Depending on the context, depending on the outcome, choose your paradigm. You see, because both the paradigms are human constructions. They are cultural creations, not natural phenomena. And so the next time you meet someone, a stranger, one request: Understand that you live in the subjective truth, and so does he. Understand it.

\"the naked, wise man.\"\n\n00:03:33.958 --> 00:03:35.958\nWe don't know who he was.\n\n00:03:35.958 --> 00:03:37.958\nPerhaps he was a Jain monk,\n\n00:03:37.958 --> 00:03:39.958\nlike Bahubali over

yogi\n\n00:03:44.958 --> 00:03:46.958\nwho was sitting on a rock, staring at the sky\n\n00:03:46.958 --> 00:03:48.958\nand the sun and the moon.\n\n00:03:48.958 --> 00:03:51.958\nAlexander asked, \"What are you doing?\"\n\n00:03:51.958 --> 00:03:53.958\nand the gymnosophist answered,\n\n00:03:53.958 --> 00:03:56.958\n\"I'm experiencing nothingness.\"\n\n00:03:56.958 --> 00:03:59.958\nThen the

they both laughed.\n\n00:04:07.958 --> 00:04:11.958\nEach one thought that the other was a fool.\n\n00:04:11.958 --> 00:04:15.958\nThe gymnosophist said, \"Why is he conquering the world?\n\n00:04:15.958 --> 00:04:18.958\nIt's pointless.\"\n\n00:04:18.958 --> 00:04:20.958\nAnd Alexander thought,\n\n00:04:20.958 --> 00:04:22.958\n\"Why is he sitting around, doing nothing?\n\n00:04:22.958 --> 00:04:24.958\nWhat a waste of a life.\"\n\n00:04:24.958 --> 00:04:28.958\nTo understand this difference in viewpoints,\n\n00:04:28.958 --> 00:04:31.958\nwe have to understand\n\n00:04:31.958 --> 00:04:34.958\nthe subjective truth of Alexander --\n\n00:04:34.958 --> 00:04:39.958\nhis myth, and the mythology that constructed it.\n\n00:04:39.958 --> 00:04:42.958\nAlexander's mother, his parents, his teacher Aristotle\n\n00:04:42.958 --> 00:04:45.958\ntold him the story of Homer's \"Iliad.\"\n\n00:04:45.958 --> 00:04:48.958\nThey told him of a great hero called Achilles,\n\n00:04:48.958 --> 00:04:51.958\nwho, when he participated in battle, victory was assured,\n\n00:04:51.958 --> 00:04:54.958\nbut when he withdrew from the battle,\n\n00:04:54.958 --> 00:04:57.958\ndefeat was inevitable.\n\n00:04:57.958 --> 00:05:00.958\n\"Achilles was a man who could shape history,\n\n00:05:00.958 --> 00:05:03.958\na man of

be?\n\n00:05:11.958 --> 00:05:14.958\nYou should not be Sisyphus,\n\n00:05:14.958 --> 00:05:16.958\nwho rolls a rock up a mountain all day\n\n00:05:16.958 --> 00:05:21.958\nonly to find the boulder rolled down at night.\n\n00:05:21.958 --> 00:05:24.958\nDon't live a life which is monotonous,\n\n00:05:24.958 --> 00:05:26.958\nmediocre, meaningless.\n\n00:05:26.958 --> 00:05:29.958\nBe spectacular! --\n\n00:05:29.958 --> 00:05:31.958\nlike the Greek heroes,\n\n00:05:31.958 --> 00:05:33.958\nlike Jason, who went across the sea\n\n00:05:33.958 --> 00:05:37.958\nwith the Argonauts and fetched the Golden Fleece.\n\n00:05:37.958 --> 00:05:40.958\nBe spectacular like Theseus,\n\n00:05:40.958 --> 00:05:46.958\nwho entered the labyrinth and killed the bull-headed Minotaur.\n\n00:05:46.958 --> 00:05:50.958\nWhen you play in a race, win! --\n\n00:05:50.958 --> 00:05:53.958\nbecause when you win, the exhilaration of victory\n\n00:05:53.958 --> 00:05:58.958\nis the closest you will come to the ambrosia of the gods.\"\n\n00:05:58.958 --> 00:06:01.958\nBecause, you see, the Greeks believed\n\n00:06:01.958 --> 00:06:03.958\nyou live only once,\n\n00:06:03.958 --> 00:06:07.958\nand when you die, you have to cross the River Styx.\n\n00:06:07.958 --> 00:06:10.958\nAnd if you have lived an extraordinary life,\n\n00:06:10.958 --> 00:06:13.958\nyou will be welcomed to Elysium,\n\n00:06:13.958 --> 00:06:17.958\nor what the French call \"Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es\" --\n\n00:06:17.958 --> 00:06:18.958\n(Laughter) --\n\n00:06:18.958 --> 00:06:21.958\nthe heaven of the heroes.\n\n00:06:24.958 --> 00:06:28.958\nBut these are not the stories that the gymnosophist heard.\n\n00:06:28.958 --> 00:06:31.958\nHe heard a very different story.\n\n00:06:31.958 --> 00:06:34.958\nHe heard of a man called Bharat,\n\n00:06:34.958 --> 00:06:37.958\nafter whom India is called Bh\u0101rata.\n\n00:06:37.958 --> 00:06:40.958\nBharat also conquered the world.\n\n00:06:40.958 --> 00:06:43.958\nAnd then he went to the top-most peak\n\n00:06:43.958 --> 00:06:46.958\nof the greatest mountain of the center of the world\n\n00:06:46.958 --> 00:06:47.958\ncalled Meru.\n\n00:06:47.958 --> 00:06:50.958\nAnd he wanted to hoist his flag to say,\n\n00:06:50.958 --> 00:06:53.958\n\"I was here first.\"\n\n00:06:53.958 --> 00:06:55.958\nBut when he reached the mountain peak,\n\n00:06:55.958 --> 00:07:00.958\nhe found the peak covered with countless flags\n\n00:07:00.958 --> 00:07:03.958\nof world-conquerors before him,\n\n00:07:03.958 --> 00:07:07.958\neach one claiming \"'I was here first' ...\n\n00:07:07.958 --> 00:07:11.958\nthat's what I thought until I came here.\"\n\n00:07:11.958 --> 00:07:14.958\nAnd suddenly, in this canvas of infinity,\n\n00:07:14.958 --> 00:07:18.958\nBharat felt insignificant.\n\n00:07:18.958 --> 00:07:22.958\nThis was the mythology of the gymnosophist.\n\n00:07:22.958 --> 00:07:27.958\nYou see, he had heroes, like Ram -- Raghupati Ram\n\n00:07:27.958 --> 00:07:29.958\nand Krishna, Govinda Hari.\n\n00:07:29.958 --> 00:07:33.958\nBut they were not two characters on two different adventures.\n\n00:07:33.958 --> 00:07:37.958\nThey were two lifetimes of the same hero.\n\n00:07:37.958 --> 00:07:41.958\nWhen the Ramayana ends the Mahabharata begins.\n\n00:07:41.958 --> 00:07:43.958\nWhen Ram dies, Krishna is born.\n\n00:07:43.958 --> 00:07:46.958\nWhen Krishna dies, eventually he will be back as Ram.\n\n00:07:46.958 --> 00:07:49.958\nYou see, the Indians also had a river\n\n00:07:49.958 --> 00:07:52.958\nthat separates the land of the living from the land of the dead.\n\n00:07:52.958 --> 00:07:54.958\nBut you don't cross it once.\n\n00:07:54.958 --> 00:07:57.958\nYou go to and fro endlessly.\n\n00:07:57.958 --> 00:08:00.958\nIt was called the Vaitarani.\n\n00:08:00.958 --> 00:08:03.958\nYou go again and again and again.\n\n00:08:03.958 --> 00:08:04.958\nBecause, you see,\n\n00:08:04.958 --> 00:08:07.958\nnothing lasts forever in India, not even death.\n\n00:08:07.958 --> 00:08:10.958\nAnd so, you have these grand rituals\n\n00:08:10.958 --> 00:08:13.958\nwhere great images of mother goddesses are built\n\n00:08:13.958 --> 00:08:15.958\nand worshiped for 10 days ...\n\n00:08:15.958 --> 00:08:17.958\nAnd what do you do at the end of 10 days?\n\n00:08:17.958 --> 00:08:20.958\nYou dunk it in the river.\n\n00:08:20.958 --> 00:08:22.958\nBecause it has to end.\n\n00:08:22.958 --> 00:08:25.958\nAnd next year, she will come back.\n\n00:08:25.958 --> 00:08:27.958\nWhat goes around always comes around,\n\n00:08:27.958 --> 00:08:30.958\nand this rule applies not just to man,\n\n00:08:30.958 --> 00:08:32.958\nbut also the gods.\n\n00:08:32.958 --> 00:08:35.958\nYou see, the gods\n\n00:08:35.958 --> 00:08:37.958\nhave to come back again and again and again\n\n00:08:37.958 --> 00:08:39.958\nas Ram, as Krishna.\n\n00:08:39.958 --> 00:08:42.958\nNot only do they live infinite lives,\n\n00:08:42.958 --> 00:08:45.958\nbut the same life is lived infinite times\n\n00:08:45.958 --> 00:08:50.958\ntill you get to the point of it all.\n\n00:08:50.958 --> 00:08:52.958\n\"Groundhog Day.\"\n\n00:08:52.958 --> 00:08:55.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:08:57.958 --> 00:09:00.958\nTwo different mythologies.\n\n00:09:00.958 --> 00:09:02.958\nWhich is right?\n\n00:09:02.958 --> 00:09:05.958\nTwo different mythologies, two different ways of looking at the world.\n\n00:09:05.958 --> 00:09:07.958\nOne linear, one cyclical.\n\n00:09:07.958 --> 00:09:09.958\nOne believes this is the one and only life.\n\n00:09:09.958 --> 00:09:14.958\nThe other believes this is one of many lives.\n\n00:09:14.958 --> 00:09:18.958\nAnd so, the denominator of Alexander's life was one.\n\n00:09:18.958 --> 00:09:21.958\nSo, the value of his life was the sum total\n\n00:09:21.958 --> 00:09:23.958\nof his achievements.\n\n00:09:23.958 --> 00:09:27.958\nThe denominator of the gymnosophist's life was infinity.\n\n00:09:27.958 --> 00:09:30.958\nSo, no matter what he did,\n\n00:09:30.958 --> 00:09:32.958\nit was always zero.\n\n00:09:32.958 --> 00:09:35.958\nAnd I believe it is this mythological paradigm\n\n00:09:35.958 --> 00:09:38.958\nthat inspired Indian mathematicians\n\n00:09:38.958 --> 00:09:40.958\nto discover the number zero.\n\n00:09:40.958 --> 00:09:42.958\nWho knows?\n\n00:09:42.958 --> 00:09:45.958\nAnd that brings us to the mythology of business.\n\n00:09:45.958 --> 00:09:48.958\nIf Alexander's belief influenced his behavior,\n\n00:09:48.958 --> 00:09:52.958\nif the gymnosophist's belief influences his behavior,\n\n00:09:52.958 --> 00:09:57.958\nthen it was bound to influence the business they were in.\n\n00:09:57.958 --> 00:09:59.958\nYou see, what is business\n\n00:09:59.958 --> 00:10:01.958\nbut the result of how the market behaves\n\n00:10:01.958 --> 00:10:04.958\nand how the organization behaves?\n\n00:10:04.958 --> 00:10:07.958\nAnd if you look at cultures around the world,\n\n00:10:07.958 --> 00:10:09.958\nall you have to do is understand the mythology\n\n00:10:09.958 --> 00:10:12.958\nand you will see how they behave and how they do business.\n\n00:10:12.958 --> 00:10:16.958\nTake a look.\n\n00:10:16.958 --> 00:10:19.958\nIf you live only once, in one-life cultures around the world,\n\n00:10:19.958 --> 00:10:21.958\nyou will see an obsession with binary logic,\n\n00:10:21.958 --> 00:10:24.958\nabsolute truth, standardization,\n\n00:10:24.958 --> 00:10:27.958\nabsoluteness, linear patterns in design.\n\n00:10:27.958 --> 00:10:30.958\nBut if you look at cultures which have cyclical\n\n00:10:30.958 --> 00:10:35.958\nand based on infinite lives, you will see a comfort with fuzzy logic,\n\n00:10:35.958 --> 00:10:37.958\nwith opinion,\n\n00:10:37.958 --> 00:10:39.958\nwith contextual thinking,\n\n00:10:39.958 --> 00:10:42.958\nwith everything is relative, sort of --\n\n00:10:42.958 --> 00:10:43.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:10:43.958 --> 00:10:45.958\nmostly.\n\n00:10:45.958 --> 00:10:46.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:10:46.958 --> 00:10:49.958\nYou look at art. Look at the ballerina,\n\n00:10:49.958 --> 00:10:51.958\nhow linear she is in her performance.\n\n00:10:51.958 --> 00:10:53.958\nAnd then look at the Indian classical dancer,\n\n00:10:53.958 --> 00:10:55.958\nthe Kuchipudi dancer, the Bharatanatyam dancer,\n\n00:10:55.958 --> 00:10:57.958\ncurvaceous.\n\n00:10:57.958 --> 00:11:00.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:11:00.958 --> 00:11:02.958\nAnd then look at business.\n\n00:11:02.958 --> 00:11:04.958\nStandard business model:\n\n00:11:04.958 --> 00:11:08.958\nvision, mission, values, processes.\n\n00:11:08.958 --> 00:11:10.958\nSounds very much like the journey through\n\n00:11:10.958 --> 00:11:12.958\nthe wilderness to the promised land,\n\n00:11:12.958 --> 00:11:14.958\nwith the commandments held by the leader.\n\n00:11:14.958 --> 00:11:19.958\nAnd if you comply, you will go to heaven.\n\n00:11:19.958 --> 00:11:21.958\nBut in India there is no \"the\" promised land.\n\n00:11:21.958 --> 00:11:24.958\nThere are many promised lands,\n\n00:11:24.958 --> 00:11:27.958\ndepending on your station in society,\n\n00:11:27.958 --> 00:11:29.958\ndepending on your stage of life.\n\n00:11:29.958 --> 00:11:33.958\nYou see, businesses are not run as institutions,\n\n00:11:33.958 --> 00:11:36.958\nby the idiosyncrasies of individuals.\n\n00:11:36.958 --> 00:11:39.958\nIt's always about taste.\n\n00:11:39.958 --> 00:11:43.958\nIt's always about my taste.\n\n00:11:43.958 --> 00:11:45.958\nYou see, Indian music, for example,\n\n00:11:45.958 --> 00:11:47.958\ndoes not have the concept of harmony.\n\n00:11:47.958 --> 00:11:51.958\nThere is no orchestra conductor.\n\n00:11:51.958 --> 00:11:54.958\nThere is one performer standing there, and everybody follows.\n\n00:11:54.958 --> 00:11:58.958\nAnd you can never replicate that performance twice.\n\n00:11:58.958 --> 00:12:00.958\nIt is not about documentation and contract.\n\n00:12:00.958 --> 00:12:04.958\nIt's about conversation and faith.\n\n00:12:04.958 --> 00:12:08.958\nIt's not about compliance. It's about setting,\n\n00:12:08.958 --> 00:12:12.958\ngetting the job done, by bending or breaking the rules --\n\n00:12:12.958 --> 00:12:14.958\njust look at your Indian people around here,\n\n00:12:14.958 --> 00:12:16.958\nyou'll see them smile; they know what it is.\n\n00:12:16.958 --> 00:12:17.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:12:17.958 --> 00:12:19.958\nAnd then look at people who have done business in India,\n\n00:12:19.958 --> 00:12:21.958\nyou'll see the exasperation on their faces.\n\n00:12:21.958 --> 00:12:22.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:12:22.958 --> 00:12:26.958\n(Applause)\n\n00:12:26.958 --> 00:12:28.958\nYou see, this is what India is today. The ground reality\n\n00:12:28.958 --> 00:12:30.958\nis based on a cyclical world view.\n\n00:12:30.958 --> 00:12:33.958\nSo, it's rapidly changing, highly diverse,\n\n00:12:33.958 --> 00:12:36.958\nchaotic, ambiguous, unpredictable.\n\n00:12:36.958 --> 00:12:39.958\nAnd people are okay with it.\n\n00:12:39.958 --> 00:12:41.958\nAnd then globalization is taking place.\n\n00:12:41.958 --> 00:12:45.958\nThe demands of modern institutional thinking is coming in.\n\n00:12:45.958 --> 00:12:49.958\nWhich is rooted in one-life culture.\n\n00:12:49.958 --> 00:12:51.958\nAnd a clash is going to take place,\n\n00:12:51.958 --> 00:12:54.958\nlike on the banks of the Indus.\n\n00:12:54.958 --> 00:12:57.958\nIt is bound to happen.\n\n00:12:57.958 --> 00:13:00.958\nI have personally experienced it. I'm trained as a medical doctor.\n\n00:13:00.958 --> 00:13:03.958\nI did not want to study surgery. Don't ask me why.\n\n00:13:03.958 --> 00:13:05.958\nI love mythology too much.\n\n00:13:05.958 --> 00:13:07.958\nI wanted to learn mythology. But there is nowhere you can study.\n\n00:13:07.958 --> 00:13:09.958\nSo, I had to teach it to myself.\n\n00:13:09.958 --> 00:13:12.958\nAnd mythology does not pay, well, until now.\n\n00:13:12.958 --> 00:13:16.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:13:16.958 --> 00:13:19.958\nSo, I had to take up a job. And I worked in the pharma industry.\n\n00:13:19.958 --> 00:13:21.958\nAnd I worked in the healthcare industry.\n\n00:13:21.958 --> 00:13:23.958\nAnd I worked as a marketing guy, and a sales guy,\n\n00:13:23.958 --> 00:13:26.958\nand a knowledge guy, and a content guy, and a training guy.\n\n00:13:26.958 --> 00:13:29.958\nI even was a business consultant, doing strategies and tactics.\n\n00:13:29.958 --> 00:13:31.958\nAnd I would see the exasperation\n\n00:13:31.958 --> 00:13:34.958\nbetween my American and European colleagues,\n\n00:13:34.958 --> 00:13:36.958\nwhen they were dealing with India.\n\n00:13:36.958 --> 00:13:39.958\nExample: Please tell us the process\n\n00:13:39.958 --> 00:13:42.958\nto invoice hospitals.\n\n00:13:42.958 --> 00:13:46.958\nStep A. Step B. Step C. Mostly.\n\n00:13:46.958 --> 00:13:48.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:13:48.958 --> 00:13:50.958\nHow do you parameterize \"mostly\"?\n\n00:13:50.958 --> 00:13:54.958\nHow do you put it in a nice little software? You can't.\n\n00:13:54.958 --> 00:13:56.958\nI would give my viewpoints to people.\n\n00:13:56.958 --> 00:13:58.958\nBut nobody was interested in listening to it,\n\n00:13:58.958 --> 00:14:02.958\nyou see, until I met Kishore Biyani of the Future group.\n\n00:14:02.958 --> 00:14:07.958\nYou see, he has established the largest retail chain, called Big Bazaar.\n\n00:14:07.958 --> 00:14:09.958\nAnd there are more than 200 formats,\n\n00:14:09.958 --> 00:14:11.958\nacross 50 cities and towns of India.\n\n00:14:11.958 --> 00:14:15.958\nAnd he was dealing with diverse and dynamic markets.\n\n00:14:15.958 --> 00:14:17.958\nAnd he knew very intuitively,\n\n00:14:17.958 --> 00:14:19.958\nthat best practices,\n\n00:14:19.958 --> 00:14:22.958\ndeveloped in Japan and China and Europe and America\n\n00:14:22.958 --> 00:14:25.958\nwill not work in India.\n\n00:14:25.958 --> 00:14:29.958\nHe knew that institutional thinking doesn't work in India. Individual thinking does.\n\n00:14:29.958 --> 00:14:33.958\nHe had an intuitive understanding of the mythic structure of India.\n\n00:14:33.958 --> 00:14:35.958\nSo, he had asked me to be the Chief Belief Officer, and said,\n\n00:14:35.958 --> 00:14:38.958\n\"All I want to do is align belief.\"\n\n00:14:38.958 --> 00:14:40.958\nSounds so simple.\n\n00:14:40.958 --> 00:14:42.958\nBut belief is not measurable.\n\n00:14:42.958 --> 00:14:44.958\nYou can't measure it. You can't manage it.\n\n00:14:44.958 --> 00:14:46.958\nSo, how do you construct belief?\n\n00:14:46.958 --> 00:14:50.958\nHow do you enhance the sensitivity of people to Indian-ness.\n\n00:14:50.958 --> 00:14:54.958\nEven if you are Indian, it is not very explicit, it is not very obvious.\n\n00:14:54.958 --> 00:14:58.958\nSo, I tried to work on the standard model of culture,\n\n00:14:58.958 --> 00:15:00.958\nwhich is, develop stories, symbols and rituals.\n\n00:15:00.958 --> 00:15:03.958\nAnd I will share one of the rituals with you.\n\n00:15:03.958 --> 00:15:06.958\nYou see it is based on the Hindu ritual of Darshan.\n\n00:15:06.958 --> 00:15:08.958\nHindus don't have the concept of commandments.\n\n00:15:08.958 --> 00:15:10.958\nSo, there is nothing right or wrong in what you do in life.\n\n00:15:10.958 --> 00:15:13.958\nSo, you're not really sure how you stand in front of God.\n\n00:15:13.958 --> 00:15:16.958\nSo, when you go to the temple, all you seek is an audience with God.\n\n00:15:16.958 --> 00:15:18.958\nYou want to see God.\n\n00:15:18.958 --> 00:15:22.958\nAnd you want God to see you, and hence the gods have very large eyes,\n\n00:15:22.958 --> 00:15:24.958\nlarge unblinking eyes,\n\n00:15:24.958 --> 00:15:27.958\nsometimes made of silver,\n\n00:15:27.958 --> 00:15:29.958\nso they look at you.\n\n00:15:29.958 --> 00:15:31.958\nBecause you don't know whether you're right or wrong, and so all you seek\n\n00:15:31.958 --> 00:15:35.958\nis divine empathy.\n\n00:15:35.958 --> 00:15:38.958\n\"Just know where I came from, why I did the Jugaad.\"\n\n00:15:38.958 --> 00:15:39.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:15:39.958 --> 00:15:41.958\n\"Why did I do the setting,\n\n00:15:41.958 --> 00:15:46.958\nwhy I don't care for the processes. Just understand me, please.\"\n\n00:15:46.958 --> 00:15:49.958\nAnd based on this, we created a ritual for leaders.\n\n00:15:49.958 --> 00:15:53.958\nAfter a leader completes his training and is about to take over the store,\n\n00:15:53.958 --> 00:15:57.958\nwe blindfold him, we surround him with the stakeholders,\n\n00:15:57.958 --> 00:16:01.958\nthe customer, his family, his team, his boss.\n\n00:16:01.958 --> 00:16:04.958\nYou read out his KRA, his KPI, you give him the keys,\n\n00:16:04.958 --> 00:16:06.958\nand then you remove the blindfold.\n\n00:16:06.958 --> 00:16:09.958\nAnd invariably, you see a tear,\n\n00:16:09.958 --> 00:16:11.958\nbecause the penny has dropped.\n\n00:16:11.958 --> 00:16:15.958\nHe realizes that to succeed,\n\n00:16:15.958 --> 00:16:18.958\nhe does not have to be a \"professional,\"\n\n00:16:18.958 --> 00:16:21.958\nhe does not have to cut out his emotions,\n\n00:16:21.958 --> 00:16:24.958\nhe has to include all these people\n\n00:16:24.958 --> 00:16:28.958\nin his world to succeed, to make them happy,\n\n00:16:28.958 --> 00:16:30.958\nto make the boss happy, to make everyone happy.\n\n00:16:30.958 --> 00:16:33.958\nThe customer is happy, because the customer is God.\n\n00:16:33.958 --> 00:16:36.958\nThat sensitivity is what we need. Once this belief enters,\n\n00:16:36.958 --> 00:16:39.958\nbehavior will happen, business will happen.\n\n00:16:39.958 --> 00:16:42.958\nAnd it has.\n\n00:16:42.958 --> 00:16:45.958\nSo, then we come back to Alexander\n\n00:16:45.958 --> 00:16:47.958\nand to the gymnosophist.\n\n00:16:47.958 --> 00:16:51.958\nAnd everybody asks me, \"Which is the better way, this way or that way?\"\n\n00:16:51.958 --> 00:16:53.958\nAnd it's a very dangerous question,\n\n00:16:53.958 --> 00:16:57.958\nbecause it leads you to the path of fundamentalism and violence.\n\n00:16:57.958 --> 00:16:59.958\nSo, I will not answer the question.\n\n00:16:59.958 --> 00:17:01.958\nWhat I will give you is an Indian answer,\n\n00:17:01.958 --> 00:17:03.958\nthe Indian head-shake.\n\n00:17:03.958 --> 00:17:05.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:17:05.958 --> 00:17:09.958\n(Applause)\n\n00:17:09.958 --> 00:17:11.958\nDepending on the context,\n\n00:17:11.958 --> 00:17:13.958\ndepending on the outcome,\n\n00:17:13.958 --> 00:17:16.958\nchoose your paradigm.\n\n00:17:16.958 --> 00:17:19.958\nYou see, because both the paradigms are human constructions.\n\n00:17:19.958 --> 00:17:22.958\nThey are cultural creations,\n\n00:17:22.958 --> 00:17:25.958\nnot natural phenomena.\n\n00:17:25.958 --> 00:17:28.958\nAnd so the next time you meet someone, a stranger,\n\n00:17:28.958 --> 00:17:30.958\none request:\n\n00:17:30.958 --> 00:17:33.958\nUnderstand that you live in the subjective truth,\n\n00:17:33.958 --> 00:17:35.958\nand so does he.\n\n00:17:35.958 --> 00:17:37.958\nUnderstand it.\n\n00:17:37.958 --> 00:17:42.958\nAnd when you understand it you will discover something spectacular.\n\n00:17:42.958 --> 00:17:44.958\nYou will discover that within infinite myths\n\n00:17:44.958 --> 00:17:46.958\nlies the eternal truth.\n\n00:17:46.958 --> 00:17:48.958\nWho sees it all?\n\n00:17:48.958 --> 00:17:50.958\nVaruna has but a thousand eyes.\n\n00:17:50.958 --> 00:17:53.958\nIndra, a hundred.\n\n00:17:53.958 --> 00:17:55.958\nYou and I, only two.\n\n00:17:55.958 --> 00:17:58.958\nThank you. Namaste.\n\n00:17:58.958 --> 00:18:16.958\n(Applause)"}, {"title": "Learn to use the 13th-century astrolabe", "duration": "565", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/tom_wujec_demos_the_13th_century_astrolabe", "transcript": "As technology progresses, and as it advances, many of us assume that these advances make us more intelligent, make us smarter and more connected to the world. And what I'd like to argue is that that's not necessarily the case, as progress is simply a word for change, and with change you gain something, but you also lose something.And to really illustrate this point, what I'd like to do is to show you how technology has dealt with a very simple, a very common, an everyday question. And that question is this. What time is it? What time is it? If you glance at your iPhone, it's so simple to tell the time. But, I'd like to ask you, how would you tell the time if you didn't have an iPhone? How would you tell the time, say, 600 years ago? How would you do it?Well, the way you would do it is by using a device that's called an astrolabe. So, an astrolabe is relatively unknown in today's world. But, at the time, in the 13th century, it was the gadget of the day. It was the world's first popular computer. And it was a device that, in fact, is a model of the sky. So, the different parts of the astrolabe, in this particular type, the rete corresponds to the positions of the stars. The plate corresponds to a coordinate system. And the mater has some scales and puts it all together.If you were an educated child, you would know how to not only use the astrolabe, you would also know how to make an astrolabe. And we know this because the first treatise on the astrolabe, the first technical manual in the English language, was written by Geoffrey Chaucer. Yes, that Geoffrey Chaucer, in 1391, to his little Lewis, his 11-year-old son. And in this book, little Lewis would know the big idea.And the central idea that makes this computer work is this thing called stereographic projection. And basically, the concept is, how do you represent the three-dimensional image of the night sky that surrounds us onto a flat, portable, two-dimensional surface. The idea is actually relatively simple. Imagine that that Earth is at the center of the universe, and surrounding it is the sky projected onto a sphere. Each point on the surface of the sphere is mapped through the bottom pole, onto a flat surface, where it is then recorded.So the North Star corresponds to the center of the device. The ecliptic, which is the path of the sun, moon, and planets correspond to an offset circle. The bright stars correspond to little daggers on the rete. And the altitude corresponds to the plate system. Now, the real genius of the astrolabe is not just the projection. The real genius is that it brings together two coordinate systems so they fit perfectly. There is the position of the sun, moon and planets on the movable rete. And then there is their location on the sky as seen from a certain latitude on the back plate. Okay?So how would you use this device? Well, let me first back up for a moment. This is an astrolabe. Pretty impressive, isn't it? And so, this astrolabe is on loan from us from the Oxford School of \u2014 Museum of History. And you can see the different components. This is the mater, the scales on the back. This is the rete. Okay. Do you see that? That's the movable part of the sky. And in the back you can see a spider web pattern. And that spider web pattern corresponds to the local coordinates in the sky. This is a rule device. And on the back are some other devices, measuring tools and scales, to be able to make some calculations. Okay?You know, I've always wanted one of these. For my thesis I actually built one of these out of paper. And this one, this is a replica from a 15th-century device. And it's worth probably about three MacBook Pros. But a real one would cost about as much as my house, and the house next to it, and actually every house on the block, on both sides of the street, maybe a school thrown in, and some \u2014 you know, a church. They are just incredibly expensive.But let me show you how to work this device. So let's go to step one. First thing that you do is you select a star in the night sky, if you're telling time at night. So, tonight, if it's clear you'll be able to see the summer triangle. And there is a bright star called Deneb. So let's select Deneb. Second, is you measure the altitude of Deneb. So, step two, I hold the device up, and then I sight its altitude there so I can see it clearly now. And then I measure its altitude. So, it's about 26 degrees. You can't see it from over there. Step three is identify the star on the front of the device. Deneb is there. I can tell. Step four is I then move the rete, move the sky, so the altitude of the star corresponds to the scale on the back. Okay, so when that happens everything lines up. I have here a model of the sky that corresponds to the real sky. Okay? So, it is, in a sense, holding a model of the universe in my hands. And then finally, I take a rule, and move the rule to a date line which then tells me the time here. Right. So, that's how the device is used. (Laughter)So, I know what you're thinking: \"That's a lot of work, isn't it? Isn't it a ton of work to be able to tell the time?\" as you glance at your iPod to just check out the time. But there is a difference between the two, because with your iPod you can tell \u2014 or your iPhone, you can tell exactly what the time is, with precision. The way little Lewis would tell the time is by a picture of the sky. He would know where things would fit in the sky. He would not only know what time it was, he would also know where the sun would rise, and how it would move across the sky. He would know what time the sun would rise, and what time it would set. And he would know that for essentially every celestial object in the heavens.So, in computer graphics and computer user interface design, there is a term called affordances. So, affordances are the qualities of an object that allow us to perform an action with it. And what the astrolabe does is it allows us, it affords us, to connect to the night sky, to look up into the night sky and be much more \u2014 to see the visible and the invisible together. So, that's just one use. Incredible, there is probably 350, 400 uses. In fact, there is a text, and that has over a thousand uses of this first computer.On the back there is scales and measurements for terrestrial navigation. You can survey with it. The city of Baghdad was surveyed with it. It can be used for calculating mathematical equations of all different types. And it would take a full university course to illustrate it. Astrolabes have an incredible history. They are over 2,000 years old. The concept of stereographic projection originated in 330 B.C.And the astrolabes come in many different sizes and shapes and forms. There is portable ones. There is large display ones. And I think what is common to all astrolabes is that they are beautiful works of art. There is a quality of craftsmanship and precision that is just astonishing and remarkable.Astrolabes, like every technology, do evolve over time. So, the earliest retes, for example, were very simple and primitive. And advancing retes became cultural emblems. This is one from Oxford. And I find this one really extraordinary because the rete pattern is completely symmetrical, and it accurately maps a completely asymmetrical, or random sky. How cool is that? This is just amazing.So, would little Lewis have an astrolabe? Probably not one made of brass. He would have one made out of wood, or paper. And the vast majority of this first computer was a portable device that you could keep in the back of your pocket. So, what does the astrolabe inspire? Well, I think the first thing is that it reminds us just how resourceful people were, our forebears were, years and years ago. It's just an incredible device.Every technology advances. Every technology is transformed and moved by others. And what we gain with a new technology, of course, is precision and accuracy. But what we lose, I think, is an accurate \u2014 a felt sense of the sky, a sense of context. Knowing the sky, knowing your relationship with the sky, is the center of the real answer to knowing what time it is.So, it's \u2014 I think astrolabes are just remarkable devices. And so, what can you learn from these devices? Well, primarily that there is a subtle knowledge that we can connect with the world. And astrolabes return us to this subtle sense of how things all fit together, and also how we connect to the world. Thanks very much.

What time is it?\n\n00:00:48.958 --> 00:00:51.958\nIf you glance at your iPhone, it's so simple to tell the time.\n\n00:00:51.958 --> 00:00:53.958\nBut, I'd like to ask you, how would you tell the time\n\n00:00:53.958 --> 00:00:55.958\nif you didn't have an iPhone?\n\n00:00:55.958 --> 00:00:58.958\nHow would you tell the time, say, 600 years ago?\n\n00:00:58.958 --> 00:01:00.958\nHow would you do it?\n\n00:01:00.958 --> 00:01:03.958\nWell, the way you would do it is by using a device\n\n00:01:03.958 --> 00:01:07.958\nthat's called an astrolabe.\n\n00:01:07.958 --> 00:01:11.958\nSo, an astrolabe is relatively unknown in today's world.\n\n00:01:11.958 --> 00:01:13.958\nBut, at the time, in the 13th century,\n\n00:01:13.958 --> 00:01:15.958\nit was the gadget of the day.\n\n00:01:15.958 --> 00:01:19.958\nIt was the world's first popular computer.\n\n00:01:19.958 --> 00:01:23.958\nAnd it was a device that, in fact, is a model of the sky.\n\n00:01:23.958 --> 00:01:25.958\nSo, the different parts of the astrolabe, in this particular type,\n\n00:01:25.958 --> 00:01:28.958\nthe rete corresponds to the positions of the stars.\n\n00:01:28.958 --> 00:01:31.958\nThe plate corresponds to a coordinate system.\n\n00:01:31.958 --> 00:01:35.958\nAnd the mater has some scales and puts it all together.\n\n00:01:35.958 --> 00:01:37.958\nIf you were an educated child,\n\n00:01:37.958 --> 00:01:39.958\nyou would know how to not only use the astrolabe,\n\n00:01:39.958 --> 00:01:42.958\nyou would also know how to make an astrolabe.\n\n00:01:42.958 --> 00:01:45.958\nAnd we know this because the first treatise on the astrolabe,\n\n00:01:45.958 --> 00:01:47.958\nthe first technical manual in the English language,\n\n00:01:47.958 --> 00:01:49.958\nwas written by Geoffrey Chaucer.\n\n00:01:49.958 --> 00:01:52.958\nYes, that Geoffrey Chaucer, in 1391,\n\n00:01:52.958 --> 00:01:56.958\nto his little Lewis, his 11-year-old son.\n\n00:01:56.958 --> 00:02:01.958\nAnd in this book, little Lewis would know the big idea.\n\n00:02:01.958 --> 00:02:03.958\nAnd the central idea that makes this computer work\n\n00:02:03.958 --> 00:02:06.958\nis this thing called stereographic projection.\n\n00:02:06.958 --> 00:02:08.958\nAnd basically, the concept is,\n\n00:02:08.958 --> 00:02:11.958\nhow do you represent the three-dimensional image\n\n00:02:11.958 --> 00:02:13.958\nof the night sky that surrounds us\n\n00:02:13.958 --> 00:02:16.958\nonto a flat, portable, two-dimensional surface.\n\n00:02:16.958 --> 00:02:18.958\nThe idea is actually relatively simple.\n\n00:02:18.958 --> 00:02:21.958\nImagine that that Earth is at the center of the universe,\n\n00:02:21.958 --> 00:02:24.958\nand surrounding it is the sky projected onto a sphere.\n\n00:02:24.958 --> 00:02:27.958\nEach point on the surface of the sphere\n\n00:02:27.958 --> 00:02:29.958\nis mapped through the bottom pole,\n\n00:02:29.958 --> 00:02:31.958\nonto a flat surface, where it is then recorded.\n\n00:02:31.958 --> 00:02:35.958\nSo the North Star corresponds to the center of the device.\n\n00:02:35.958 --> 00:02:38.958\nThe ecliptic, which is the path of the sun, moon, and planets\n\n00:02:38.958 --> 00:02:40.958\ncorrespond to an offset circle.\n\n00:02:40.958 --> 00:02:44.958\nThe bright stars correspond to little daggers on the rete.\n\n00:02:44.958 --> 00:02:47.958\nAnd the altitude corresponds to the plate system.\n\n00:02:47.958 --> 00:02:50.958\nNow, the real genius of the astrolabe is not just the projection.\n\n00:02:50.958 --> 00:02:54.958\nThe real genius is that it brings together two coordinate systems\n\n00:02:54.958 --> 00:02:56.958\nso they fit perfectly.\n\n00:02:56.958 --> 00:02:59.958\nThere is the position of the sun, moon and planets on the movable rete.\n\n00:02:59.958 --> 00:03:01.958\nAnd then there is their location on the sky\n\n00:03:01.958 --> 00:03:06.958\nas seen from a certain latitude on the back plate. Okay?\n\n00:03:06.958 --> 00:03:11.958\nSo how would you use this device?\n\n00:03:11.958 --> 00:03:17.958\nWell, let me first back up for a moment.\n\n00:03:17.958 --> 00:03:22.958\nThis is an astrolabe. Pretty impressive, isn't it?\n\n00:03:22.958 --> 00:03:25.958\nAnd so, this astrolabe is on loan from us\n\n00:03:25.958 --> 00:03:28.958\nfrom the Oxford School of -- Museum of History.\n\n00:03:28.958 --> 00:03:31.958\nAnd you can see the different components.\n\n00:03:31.958 --> 00:03:33.958\nThis is the mater, the scales on the back.\n\n00:03:33.958 --> 00:03:35.958\nThis is the rete. Okay. Do you see that?\n\n00:03:35.958 --> 00:03:38.958\nThat's the movable part of the sky.\n\n00:03:38.958 --> 00:03:40.958\nAnd in the back you can see\n\n00:03:40.958 --> 00:03:42.958\na spider web pattern.\n\n00:03:42.958 --> 00:03:46.958\nAnd that spider web pattern corresponds to the local coordinates in the sky.\n\n00:03:46.958 --> 00:03:48.958\nThis is a rule device. And on the back\n\n00:03:48.958 --> 00:03:51.958\nare some other devices, measuring tools\n\n00:03:51.958 --> 00:03:57.958\nand scales, to be able to make some calculations. Okay?\n\n00:03:57.958 --> 00:03:59.958\nYou know, I've always wanted one of these.\n\n00:03:59.958 --> 00:04:04.958\nFor my thesis I actually built one of these out of paper.\n\n00:04:04.958 --> 00:04:06.958\nAnd this one, this is a replica\n\n00:04:06.958 --> 00:04:09.958\nfrom a 15th-century device.\n\n00:04:09.958 --> 00:04:12.958\nAnd it's worth probably about three MacBook Pros.\n\n00:04:12.958 --> 00:04:15.958\nBut a real one would cost about as much as my house,\n\n00:04:15.958 --> 00:04:18.958\nand the house next to it, and actually every house on the block,\n\n00:04:18.958 --> 00:04:20.958\non both sides of the street,\n\n00:04:20.958 --> 00:04:22.958\nmaybe a school thrown in, and some -- you know, a church.\n\n00:04:22.958 --> 00:04:24.958\nThey are just incredibly expensive.\n\n00:04:24.958 --> 00:04:26.958\nBut let me show you how to work this device.\n\n00:04:26.958 --> 00:04:29.958\nSo let's go to step one.\n\n00:04:29.958 --> 00:04:31.958\nFirst thing that you do is you select a star\n\n00:04:31.958 --> 00:04:34.958\nin the night sky, if you're telling time at night.\n\n00:04:34.958 --> 00:04:37.958\nSo, tonight, if it's clear you'll be able to see the summer triangle.\n\n00:04:37.958 --> 00:04:40.958\nAnd there is a bright star called Deneb. So let's select Deneb.\n\n00:04:40.958 --> 00:04:43.958\nSecond, is you measure the altitude of Deneb.\n\n00:04:43.958 --> 00:04:46.958\nSo, step two, I hold the device up,\n\n00:04:46.958 --> 00:04:49.958\nand then I sight its altitude there\n\n00:04:49.958 --> 00:04:51.958\nso I can see it clearly now.\n\n00:04:51.958 --> 00:04:54.958\nAnd then I measure its altitude.\n\n00:04:54.958 --> 00:04:57.958\nSo, it's about 26 degrees. You can't see it from over there.\n\n00:04:57.958 --> 00:05:02.958\nStep three is identify the star on the front of the device.\n\n00:05:02.958 --> 00:05:04.958\nDeneb is there. I can tell.\n\n00:05:04.958 --> 00:05:07.958\nStep four is I then move the rete,\n\n00:05:07.958 --> 00:05:10.958\nmove the sky, so the altitude of the star\n\n00:05:10.958 --> 00:05:13.958\ncorresponds to the scale on the back.\n\n00:05:13.958 --> 00:05:16.958\nOkay, so when that happens\n\n00:05:16.958 --> 00:05:18.958\neverything lines up.\n\n00:05:18.958 --> 00:05:20.958\nI have here a model of the sky\n\n00:05:20.958 --> 00:05:23.958\nthat corresponds to the real sky. Okay?\n\n00:05:23.958 --> 00:05:25.958\nSo, it is, in a sense,\n\n00:05:25.958 --> 00:05:28.958\nholding a model of the universe in my hands.\n\n00:05:28.958 --> 00:05:31.958\nAnd then finally, I take a rule,\n\n00:05:31.958 --> 00:05:33.958\nand move the rule to a date line\n\n00:05:33.958 --> 00:05:36.958\nwhich then tells me the time here.\n\n00:05:36.958 --> 00:05:39.958\nRight. So, that's how the device is used.\n\n00:05:39.958 --> 00:05:40.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:05:40.958 --> 00:05:42.958\nSo, I know what you're thinking:\n\n00:05:42.958 --> 00:05:46.958\n\"That's a lot of work, isn't it? Isn't it a ton of work to be able to tell the time?\"\n\n00:05:46.958 --> 00:05:50.958\nas you glance at your iPod to just check out the time.\n\n00:05:50.958 --> 00:05:52.958\nBut there is a difference between the two, because with your iPod\n\n00:05:52.958 --> 00:05:55.958\nyou can tell -- or your iPhone, you can tell exactly\n\n00:05:55.958 --> 00:05:57.958\nwhat the time is, with precision.\n\n00:05:57.958 --> 00:05:59.958\nThe way little Lewis would tell the time\n\n00:05:59.958 --> 00:06:01.958\nis by a picture of the sky.\n\n00:06:01.958 --> 00:06:04.958\nHe would know where things would fit in the sky.\n\n00:06:04.958 --> 00:06:07.958\nHe would not only know what time it was,\n\n00:06:07.958 --> 00:06:09.958\nhe would also know where the sun would rise,\n\n00:06:09.958 --> 00:06:12.958\nand how it would move across the sky.\n\n00:06:12.958 --> 00:06:16.958\nHe would know what time the sun would rise, and what time it would set.\n\n00:06:16.958 --> 00:06:18.958\nAnd he would know that for essentially every celestial object\n\n00:06:18.958 --> 00:06:20.958\nin the heavens.\n\n00:06:20.958 --> 00:06:22.958\nSo, in computer graphics\n\n00:06:22.958 --> 00:06:25.958\nand computer user interface design,\n\n00:06:25.958 --> 00:06:28.958\nthere is a term called affordances.\n\n00:06:28.958 --> 00:06:31.958\nSo, affordances are the qualities of an object\n\n00:06:31.958 --> 00:06:34.958\nthat allow us to perform an action with it.\n\n00:06:34.958 --> 00:06:36.958\nAnd what the astrolabe does is it allows us,\n\n00:06:36.958 --> 00:06:39.958\nit affords us, to connect to the night sky,\n\n00:06:39.958 --> 00:06:42.958\nto look up into the night sky and be much more --\n\n00:06:42.958 --> 00:06:45.958\nto see the visible and the invisible together.\n\n00:06:45.958 --> 00:06:49.958\nSo, that's just one use. Incredible,\n\n00:06:49.958 --> 00:06:52.958\nthere is probably 350, 400 uses.\n\n00:06:52.958 --> 00:06:54.958\nIn fact, there is a text, and that has over a thousand uses\n\n00:06:54.958 --> 00:06:56.958\nof this first computer.\n\n00:06:56.958 --> 00:06:58.958\nOn the back there is scales and measurements\n\n00:06:58.958 --> 00:07:00.958\nfor terrestrial navigation.\n\n00:07:00.958 --> 00:07:03.958\nYou can survey with it. The city of Baghdad was surveyed with it.\n\n00:07:03.958 --> 00:07:07.958\nIt can be used for calculating mathematical equations of all different types.\n\n00:07:07.958 --> 00:07:10.958\nAnd it would take a full university course to illustrate it.\n\n00:07:10.958 --> 00:07:12.958\nAstrolabes have an incredible history.\n\n00:07:12.958 --> 00:07:14.958\nThey are over 2,000 years old.\n\n00:07:14.958 --> 00:07:17.958\nThe concept of stereographic projection\n\n00:07:17.958 --> 00:07:19.958\noriginated in 330 B.C.\n\n00:07:19.958 --> 00:07:21.958\nAnd the astrolabes come in many different\n\n00:07:21.958 --> 00:07:23.958\nsizes and shapes and forms.\n\n00:07:23.958 --> 00:07:26.958\nThere is portable ones. There is large display ones.\n\n00:07:26.958 --> 00:07:28.958\nAnd I think what is common to all astrolabes\n\n00:07:28.958 --> 00:07:30.958\nis that they are beautiful works of art.\n\n00:07:30.958 --> 00:07:33.958\nThere is a quality of craftsmanship and precision\n\n00:07:33.958 --> 00:07:36.958\nthat is just astonishing and remarkable.\n\n00:07:36.958 --> 00:07:39.958\nAstrolabes, like every technology, do evolve over time.\n\n00:07:39.958 --> 00:07:43.958\nSo, the earliest retes, for example, were very simple and primitive.\n\n00:07:43.958 --> 00:07:45.958\nAnd advancing retes became cultural emblems.\n\n00:07:45.958 --> 00:07:48.958\nThis is one from Oxford.\n\n00:07:48.958 --> 00:07:50.958\nAnd I find this one really extraordinary because the rete pattern\n\n00:07:50.958 --> 00:07:52.958\nis completely symmetrical,\n\n00:07:52.958 --> 00:07:56.958\nand it accurately maps a completely asymmetrical, or random sky.\n\n00:07:56.958 --> 00:07:58.958\nHow cool is that? This is just amazing.\n\n00:07:58.958 --> 00:08:01.958\nSo, would little Lewis have an astrolabe?\n\n00:08:01.958 --> 00:08:04.958\nProbably not one made of brass. He would have one made out of wood,\n\n00:08:04.958 --> 00:08:07.958\nor paper. And the vast majority of this first computer\n\n00:08:07.958 --> 00:08:09.958\nwas a portable device\n\n00:08:09.958 --> 00:08:12.958\nthat you could keep in the back of your pocket.\n\n00:08:12.958 --> 00:08:15.958\nSo, what does the astrolabe inspire?\n\n00:08:15.958 --> 00:08:17.958\nWell, I think the first thing is that\n\n00:08:17.958 --> 00:08:21.958\nit reminds us just how resourceful people were,\n\n00:08:21.958 --> 00:08:23.958\nour forebears were, years and years ago.\n\n00:08:23.958 --> 00:08:26.958\nIt's just an incredible device.\n\n00:08:26.958 --> 00:08:28.958\nEvery technology advances.\n\n00:08:28.958 --> 00:08:31.958\nEvery technology is transformed and moved by others.\n\n00:08:31.958 --> 00:08:33.958\nAnd what we gain with a new technology, of course,\n\n00:08:33.958 --> 00:08:35.958\nis precision and accuracy.\n\n00:08:35.958 --> 00:08:37.958\nBut what we lose, I think, is\n\n00:08:37.958 --> 00:08:40.958\nan accurate -- a felt sense\n\n00:08:40.958 --> 00:08:43.958\nof the sky, a sense of context.\n\n00:08:43.958 --> 00:08:47.958\nKnowing the sky, knowing your relationship with the sky,\n\n00:08:47.958 --> 00:08:51.958\nis the center of the real answer\n\n00:08:51.958 --> 00:08:53.958\nto knowing what time it is.\n\n00:08:53.958 --> 00:08:57.958\nSo, it's -- I think astrolabes are just remarkable devices.\n\n00:08:57.958 --> 00:09:00.958\nAnd so, what can you learn from these devices?\n\n00:09:00.958 --> 00:09:03.958\nWell, primarily that there is a subtle knowledge\n\n00:09:03.958 --> 00:09:05.958\nthat we can connect with the world.\n\n00:09:05.958 --> 00:09:08.958\nAnd astrolabes return us to this subtle sense\n\n00:09:08.958 --> 00:09:11.958\nof how things all fit together,\n\n00:09:11.958 --> 00:09:13.958\nand also how we connect to the world.\n\n00:09:13.958 --> 00:09:15.958\nThanks very much.\n\n00:09:15.958 --> 00:09:17.958\n(Applause)"}, {"title": "Asia's rise -- how and when", "duration": "950", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/hans_rosling_asia_s_rise_how_and_when", "transcript": "Once upon a time, at the age of 24, I was a student at St. John's Medical College in Bangalore. I was a guest student during one month of a public health course. And that changed my mindset forever. The course was good, but it was not the course content in itself that changed the mindset. It was the brutal realization, the first morning, that the Indian students were better than me.(Laughter)You see, I was a study nerd. I loved statistics from a young age. And I studied very much in Sweden. I used to be in the upper quarter of all courses I attended. But in St. John's, I was in the lower quarter. And the fact was that Indian students studied harder than we did in Sweden. They read the textbook twice, or three times or four times. In Sweden we read it once and then we went partying.(Laugher)And that, to me, that personal experience was the first time in my life that the mindset I grew up with was changed. And I realized that perhaps the Western world will not continue to dominate the world forever. And I think many of you have the same sort of personal experience. It's that realization of someone you meet that really made you change your ideas about the world. It's not the statistics, although I tried to make it funny.And I will now, here, onstage, try to predict when that will happen \u2014 that Asia will regain its dominant position as the leading part of the world, as it used to be, over thousands of years. And I will do that by trying to predict precisely at what year the average income per person in India, in China, will reach that of the West. And I don't mean the whole economy, because to grow an economy of India to the size of U.K. \u2014 that's a piece of cake, with one billion people. But I want to see when will the average pay, the money for each person, per month, in India and China, when will that have reached that of U.K. and the United States?But I will start with a historical background. And you can see my map if I get it up here. You know? I will start at 1858. 1858 was a year of great technological advancement in the West. That was the year when Queen Victoria was able, for the first time, to communicate with President Buchanan, through the Transatlantic Telegraphic Cable. And they were the first to \"Twitter\" transatlantically. (Laughter) (Applause) And I've been able, through this wonderful Google and Internet, to find the text of the telegram sent back from President Buchanan to Queen Victoria. And it ends like this: \"This telegraph is a fantastic instrument to diffuse religion, civilization, liberty and law throughout the world.\"Those are nice words. But I got sort of curious of what he meant with liberty, and liberty for whom. And we will think about that when we look at the wider picture of the world in 1858. Because 1858 was also watershed year in the history of Asia. 1858 was the year when the courageous uprising against the foreign occupation of India was defeated by the British forces. And India was up to 89 years more of foreign domination.1858 in China was the victory in the Opium War by the British forces. And that meant that foreigners, as it said in the treaty, were allowed to trade freely in China. It meant paying with opium for Chinese goods.And 1858 in Japan was the year when Japan had to sign the Harris Treaty and accept trade on favorable condition for the U.S. And they were threatened by those black ships there, that had been in Tokyo harbor over the last year. But, Japan, in contrast to India and China, maintained its national sovereignty.And let's see how much difference that can make. And I will do that by bringing these bubbles back to a Gapminder graph here, where you can see each bubble is a country. The size of the bubble here is the population. On this axis, as I used to have income per person in comparable dollar. And on that axis I have life expectancy, the health of people. And I also bring an innovation here. I have transformed the laser beam into an ecological, recyclable version here, in green India.(Applause)And we will see, you know. Look here, 1858, India was here, China was here, Japan was there, United States and United Kingdom was richer over there. And I will start the world like this. India was not always like this level. Actually if we go back into the historical record, there was a time hundreds of years ago when the income per person in India and China was even above that of Europe. But 1850 had already been many, many years of foreign domination, and India had been de-industrialized. And you can see that the countries who were growing their economy was United States and United Kingdom. And they were also, by the end of the century, getting healthy, and Japan was starting to catch up. India was trying down here. Can you see how it starts to move there? But really, really natural sovereignty was good for Japan. And Japan is trying to move up there.And it's the new century now. Health is getting better, United Kingdom, United States. But careful now \u2014 we are approaching the First World War. And the First World War, you know, we'll see a lot of deaths and economical problems here. United Kingdom is going down. And now comes the Spanish flu also. And then after the First World War, they continue up. Still under foreign domination, and without sovereignty, India and China are down in the corner. Not much has happened. They have grown their population but not much more. In the 1930's now, you can see that Japan is going to a period of war, with lower life expectancy. And the Second World War was really a terrible event, also economically for Japan. But they did recover quite fast afterwards. And we are moving into the new world. In 1947 India finally gained its independence. And they could raise the Indian flag and become a sovereign nation, but in very big difficulties down there.(Applause)In 1949 we saw the emergence of the modern China in a way which surprised the world. And what happened? What happens in the after independence? You can see that the health started to improve. Children started to go to school. Health services were provided. This is the Great Leap Forward, when China fell down. It was central planning by Mao Tse Tung. China recovered. Then they said, \"Nevermore, stupid central planning.\" But they went up here, and India was trying to follow. And they were catching up indeed. And both countries had the better health, but still a very low economy.And we came to 1978, and Mao Tse Tung died, and a new guy turned up from the left. And it was Deng Xiaoping coming out here. And he said, \"Doesn't matter if a cat is white or black, as long as it catches mice.\" Because catching mice is what the two cats wanted to do. And you can see the two cats being here, China and India, wanting to catch the mices over there, you know. And they decided to go not only for health and education, but also starting to grow their economy. And the market reformer was successful there. In '92 India follows with a market reform. And they go quite closely together, and you can see that the similarity with India and China, in many ways, are greater than the differences with them.And here they march on. And will they catch up?This is the big question today. There they are today.Now what does it mean that the \u2014 (Applause) the averages there \u2014 this is the average of China. If I would split China, look here, Shanghai has already catched up. Shanghai is already there. And it's healthier than the United States. But on the other hand, Guizhou, one of the poorest inland provinces of China, is there. And if I split Guizhou into urban and rural, the rural part of Guizhou goes down there. You see this enormous inequity in China, in the midst of fast economic growth.And if I would also look at India, you have another type of inequity, actually, in India. The geographical, macro-geographical difference is not so big. Uttar Pradesh, the biggest of the states here, is poorer and has a lower health than the rest of India. Kerala is flying on top there, matching United States in health, but not in economy. And here, Maharashtra, with Mumbai, is forging forward. Now in India, the big inequities are within the state, rather than between the states. And that is not a bad thing, in itself. If you have a lot inequity, macro-geographical inequities can be more difficult in the long term to deal with, than if it is in the same area where you have a growth center relatively close to where poor people are living.No, there is one more inequity. Look there, United States. (Laughter) Oh, they broke my frame. Washington, D.C. went out here. My friends at Gapminder wanted me to show this because there is a new leader in Washington who is really concerned about the health system. And I can understand him, because Washington, D.C. is so rich over there but they are not as healthy as Kerala. It's quite interesting, isn't it? (Applause) I can see a business opportunity for Kerala, helping fix the health system in the United States.(Laughter)(Applause)Now here we have the whole world. You have the legend down there. And when you see the two giant cats here, pushing forward, you see that in between them and ahead of them, is the whole emerging economies of the world, which Thomas Friedman so correctly called the \"flat world.\" You can see that in health and education, a large part of the world population is putting forward, but in Africa, and other parts, as in rural Guizhou in China, there is still people with low health and very low economy. We have an enormous disparity in the world. But most of the world in the middle are pushing forwards very fast.Now, back to my projections. When will it catch up? I have to go back to very conventional graph. I will show income per person on this axis instead, poor down here, rich up there. And then time here, from 1858 I start the world. And we shall see what will happen with these countries. You see, China under foreign domination actually lowered their income and came down to the Indian level here. Whereas U.K. and United States is getting richer and richer. And after Second World War, United States is richer than U.K. But independence is coming here. Growth is starting, economic reform. Growth is faster, and with projection from IMF you can see where you expect them to be in 2014.Now, the question is, \"When will the catch up take place?\" Look at, look at the United States. Can you see the bubble? The bubbles, not my bubbles, but the financial bubbles. That's the dot com bubble. This is the Lehman Brothers doorstep there. You see it came down there. And it seems this is another rock coming down there, you know. So they doesn't seem to go this way, these countries. They seem to go in a more humble growth way, you know. And people interested in growth are turning their eyes towards Asia.I can compare to Japan. This is Japan coming up. You see, Japan did it like that. We add Japan to it. And there is no doubt that fast catch up can take place. Can you see here what Japan did? Japan did it like this, until full catch up, and then they follow with the other high-income economies. But the real projections for those ones, I would like to give it like this. Can be worse, can be better. It's always difficult to predict, especially about the future. Now, a historian tells me it's even more difficult to predict about the past.(Laughter)I think I'm in a difficult position here. Inequalities in China and India I consider really the big obstacle because to bring the entire population into growth and prosperity is what will create a domestic market, what will avoid social instability, and which will make use of the entire capacity of the population. So, social investments in health, education and infrastructure, and electricity is really what is needed in India and China.You know the climate. We have great international experts within India telling us that the climate is changing, and actions has to be taken, otherwise China and India would be the countries most to suffer from climate change. And I consider India and China the best partners in the world in a good global climate policy. But they ain't going to pay for what others, who have more money, have largely created, and I can agree on that.But what I'm really worried about is war. Will the former rich countries really accept a completely changed world economy, and a shift of power away from where it has been the last 50 to 100 to 150 years, back to Asia? And will Asia be able to handle that new position of being in charge of being the most mighty, and the governors of the world? So, always avoid war, because that always pushes human beings backward. Now if these inequalities, climate and war can be avoided, get ready for a world in equity, because this is what seems to be happening.And that vision that I got as a young student, 1972, that Indians can be much better than Swedes, is just about to happen. And it will happen precisely the year 2048 in the later part of the summer, in July, more precisely, the 27th of July. (Applause) The 27th of July, 2048 is my 100th birthday.

You know?\n\n00:02:45.958 --> 00:02:48.958\nI will start at 1858.\n\n00:02:48.958 --> 00:02:52.958\n1858 was a year of great technological\n\n00:02:52.958 --> 00:02:54.958\nadvancement in the West.\n\n00:02:54.958 --> 00:02:57.958\nThat was the year when Queen Victoria\n\n00:02:57.958 --> 00:02:59.958\nwas able, for the first time, to communicate\n\n00:02:59.958 --> 00:03:01.958\nwith President Buchanan,\n\n00:03:01.958 --> 00:03:04.958\nthrough the Transatlantic Telegraphic Cable.\n\n00:03:04.958 --> 00:03:07.958\nAnd they were the first to \"Twitter\" transatlantically.\n\n00:03:07.958 --> 00:03:08.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:03:08.958 --> 00:03:12.958\n(Applause)\n\n00:03:12.958 --> 00:03:15.958\nAnd I've been able, through this wonderful Google and Internet,\n\n00:03:15.958 --> 00:03:17.958\nto find the text of the telegram\n\n00:03:17.958 --> 00:03:21.958\nsent back from President Buchanan to Queen Victoria.\n\n00:03:21.958 --> 00:03:24.958\nAnd it ends like this: \"This telegraph\n\n00:03:24.958 --> 00:03:26.958\nis a fantastic instrument to diffuse religion,\n\n00:03:26.958 --> 00:03:30.958\ncivilization, liberty and law throughout the world.\"\n\n00:03:30.958 --> 00:03:33.958\nThose are nice words.

Health is getting better,\n\n00:06:11.958 --> 00:06:13.958\nUnited Kingdom, United States.\n\n00:06:13.958 --> 00:06:16.958\nBut careful now -- we are approaching the First World War.\n\n00:06:16.958 --> 00:06:18.958\nAnd the First World War, you know,\n\n00:06:18.958 --> 00:06:22.958\nwe'll see a lot of deaths and economical problems here.\n\n00:06:22.958 --> 00:06:24.958\nUnited Kingdom is going down.\n\n00:06:24.958 --> 00:06:26.958\nAnd now comes the Spanish flu also.\n\n00:06:26.958 --> 00:06:29.958\nAnd then after the First World War, they continue up.\n\n00:06:29.958 --> 00:06:32.958\nStill under foreign domination, and without sovereignty,\n\n00:06:32.958 --> 00:06:34.958\nIndia and China are down in the corner.\n\n00:06:34.958 --> 00:06:36.958\nNot much has happened.\n\n00:06:36.958 --> 00:06:38.958\nThey have grown their population but not much more.\n\n00:06:38.958 --> 00:06:40.958\nIn the 1930's now, you can see\n\n00:06:40.958 --> 00:06:43.958\nthat Japan is going to a period of war,\n\n00:06:43.958 --> 00:06:45.958\nwith lower life expectancy.\n\n00:06:45.958 --> 00:06:47.958\nAnd the Second World War was really a terrible event,\n\n00:06:47.958 --> 00:06:49.958\nalso economically for Japan.\n\n00:06:49.958 --> 00:06:51.958\nBut they did recover quite fast afterwards.\n\n00:06:51.958 --> 00:06:53.958\nAnd we are moving into the new world.\n\n00:06:53.958 --> 00:06:56.958\nIn 1947 India finally\n\n00:06:56.958 --> 00:06:58.958\ngained its independence.\n\n00:06:58.958 --> 00:07:02.958\nAnd they could raise the Indian flag and become a sovereign nation,\n\n00:07:02.958 --> 00:07:05.958\nbut in very big difficulties down there.\n\n00:07:05.958 --> 00:07:08.958\n(Applause)\n\n00:07:08.958 --> 00:07:12.958\nIn 1949 we saw the emergence of the modern China\n\n00:07:12.958 --> 00:07:14.958\nin a way which surprised the world.\n\n00:07:14.958 --> 00:07:16.958\nAnd what happened?\n\n00:07:16.958 --> 00:07:18.958\nWhat happens in the after independence?\n\n00:07:18.958 --> 00:07:20.958\nYou can see that the health started to improve.\n\n00:07:20.958 --> 00:07:22.958\nChildren started to go to school.\n\n00:07:22.958 --> 00:07:24.958\nHealth services were provided.\n\n00:07:24.958 --> 00:07:28.958\nThis is the Great Leap Forward, when China fell down.\n\n00:07:28.958 --> 00:07:30.958\nIt was central planning by Mao Tse Tung.\n\n00:07:30.958 --> 00:07:32.958\nChina recovered. Then they said,\n\n00:07:32.958 --> 00:07:34.958\n\"Nevermore, stupid central planning.\"\n\n00:07:34.958 --> 00:07:37.958\nBut they went up here, and India was trying to follow.\n\n00:07:37.958 --> 00:07:39.958\nAnd they were catching up indeed.\n\n00:07:39.958 --> 00:07:41.958\nAnd both countries had the better health, but still\n\n00:07:41.958 --> 00:07:43.958\na very low economy.\n\n00:07:43.958 --> 00:07:46.958\nAnd we came to 1978, and Mao Tse Tung died,\n\n00:07:46.958 --> 00:07:49.958\nand a new guy turned up from the left.\n\n00:07:49.958 --> 00:07:52.958\nAnd it was Deng Xiaoping coming out here.\n\n00:07:52.958 --> 00:07:54.958\nAnd he said, \"Doesn't matter\n\n00:07:54.958 --> 00:07:56.958\nif a cat is white or black,\n\n00:07:56.958 --> 00:07:58.958\nas long as it catches mice.\"\n\n00:07:58.958 --> 00:08:00.958\nBecause catching mice\n\n00:08:00.958 --> 00:08:03.958\nis what the two cats wanted to do.\n\n00:08:03.958 --> 00:08:06.958\nAnd you can see the two cats being here,\n\n00:08:06.958 --> 00:08:09.958\nChina and India, wanting to catch the mices over there, you know.\n\n00:08:09.958 --> 00:08:12.958\nAnd they decided to go not only for health and education,\n\n00:08:12.958 --> 00:08:14.958\nbut also starting to grow their economy.\n\n00:08:14.958 --> 00:08:16.958\nAnd the market reformer was successful there.\n\n00:08:16.958 --> 00:08:19.958\nIn '92 India follows with a market reform.\n\n00:08:19.958 --> 00:08:21.958\nAnd they go quite closely together,\n\n00:08:21.958 --> 00:08:23.958\nand you can see that the similarity with India and China,\n\n00:08:23.958 --> 00:08:26.958\nin many ways, are greater than the differences with them.\n\n00:08:26.958 --> 00:08:28.958\nAnd here they march on. And will they catch up?\n\n00:08:28.958 --> 00:08:30.958\nThis is the big question today.\n\n00:08:30.958 --> 00:08:32.958\nThere they are today.\n\n00:08:32.958 --> 00:08:34.958\nNow what does it mean that the --\n\n00:08:34.958 --> 00:08:37.958\n(Applause)\n\n00:08:37.958 --> 00:08:40.958\nthe averages there -- this is the average of China.\n\n00:08:40.958 --> 00:08:42.958\nIf I would split China, look here,\n\n00:08:42.958 --> 00:08:45.958\nShanghai has already catched up.\n\n00:08:45.958 --> 00:08:47.958\nShanghai is already there.\n\n00:08:47.958 --> 00:08:51.958\nAnd it's healthier than the United States.\n\n00:08:51.958 --> 00:08:54.958\nBut on the other hand, Guizhou, one of the poorest\n\n00:08:54.958 --> 00:08:57.958\ninland provinces of China, is there.\n\n00:08:57.958 --> 00:09:01.958\nAnd if I split Guizhou into urban and rural,\n\n00:09:01.958 --> 00:09:04.958\nthe rural part of Guizhou goes down there.\n\n00:09:04.958 --> 00:09:07.958\nYou see this enormous inequity in China,\n\n00:09:07.958 --> 00:09:09.958\nin the midst of fast economic growth.\n\n00:09:09.958 --> 00:09:11.958\nAnd if I would also look at India,\n\n00:09:11.958 --> 00:09:14.958\nyou have another type of inequity, actually, in India.\n\n00:09:14.958 --> 00:09:19.958\nThe geographical, macro-geographical difference is not so big.\n\n00:09:19.958 --> 00:09:21.958\nUttar Pradesh, the biggest of the states here,\n\n00:09:21.958 --> 00:09:24.958\nis poorer and has a lower health than the rest of India.\n\n00:09:24.958 --> 00:09:27.958\nKerala is flying on top there,\n\n00:09:27.958 --> 00:09:29.958\nmatching United States in health,\n\n00:09:29.958 --> 00:09:31.958\nbut not in economy.\n\n00:09:31.958 --> 00:09:33.958\nAnd here, Maharashtra, with Mumbai,\n\n00:09:33.958 --> 00:09:35.958\nis forging forward.\n\n00:09:35.958 --> 00:09:38.958\nNow in India, the big inequities are within the state,\n\n00:09:38.958 --> 00:09:40.958\nrather than between the states.\n\n00:09:40.958 --> 00:09:43.958\nAnd that is not a bad thing, in itself.\n\n00:09:43.958 --> 00:09:47.958\nIf you have a lot inequity, macro-geographical inequities\n\n00:09:47.958 --> 00:09:50.958\ncan be more difficult in the long term to deal with,\n\n00:09:50.958 --> 00:09:53.958\nthan if it is in the same area where you have a growth center\n\n00:09:53.958 --> 00:09:56.958\nrelatively close to where poor people are living.\n\n00:09:56.958 --> 00:09:59.958\nNo, there is one more inequity. Look there, United States.\n\n00:09:59.958 --> 00:10:00.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:10:00.958 --> 00:10:02.958\nOh, they broke my frame.\n\n00:10:02.958 --> 00:10:05.958\nWashington, D.C. went out here.\n\n00:10:05.958 --> 00:10:08.958\nMy friends at Gapminder wanted me to show this\n\n00:10:08.958 --> 00:10:10.958\nbecause there is a new leader in Washington\n\n00:10:10.958 --> 00:10:12.958\nwho is really concerned about the health system.\n\n00:10:12.958 --> 00:10:15.958\nAnd I can understand him, because Washington, D.C.\n\n00:10:15.958 --> 00:10:18.958\nis so rich over there\n\n00:10:18.958 --> 00:10:20.958\nbut they are not as healthy as Kerala.\n\n00:10:20.958 --> 00:10:22.958\nIt's quite interesting, isn't it?\n\n00:10:22.958 --> 00:10:27.958\n(Applause)\n\n00:10:27.958 --> 00:10:30.958\nI can see a business opportunity for Kerala,\n\n00:10:30.958 --> 00:10:32.958\nhelping fix the health system in the United States.\n\n00:10:32.958 --> 00:10:34.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:10:34.958 --> 00:10:36.958\n(Applause)\n\n00:10:36.958 --> 00:10:39.958\nNow here we have the whole world. You have the legend down there.\n\n00:10:39.958 --> 00:10:43.958\nAnd when you see the two giant cats here, pushing forward,\n\n00:10:43.958 --> 00:10:45.958\nyou see that in between them\n\n00:10:45.958 --> 00:10:47.958\nand ahead of them,\n\n00:10:47.958 --> 00:10:49.958\nis the whole emerging economies of the world,\n\n00:10:49.958 --> 00:10:53.958\nwhich Thomas Friedman so correctly called the \"flat world.\"\n\n00:10:53.958 --> 00:10:55.958\nYou can see that in health and education,\n\n00:10:55.958 --> 00:10:58.958\na large part of the world population is putting forward,\n\n00:10:58.958 --> 00:11:00.958\nbut in Africa, and other parts,\n\n00:11:00.958 --> 00:11:02.958\nas in rural Guizhou in China,\n\n00:11:02.958 --> 00:11:05.958\nthere is still people with low health and very low economy.\n\n00:11:05.958 --> 00:11:07.958\nWe have an enormous disparity in the world.\n\n00:11:07.958 --> 00:11:12.958\nBut most of the world in the middle are pushing forwards very fast.\n\n00:11:12.958 --> 00:11:14.958\nNow, back to my projections.\n\n00:11:14.958 --> 00:11:19.958\nWhen will it catch up? I have to go back to very conventional graph.\n\n00:11:19.958 --> 00:11:22.958\nI will show income per person on this axis instead,\n\n00:11:22.958 --> 00:11:24.958\npoor down here, rich up there.\n\n00:11:24.958 --> 00:11:26.958\nAnd then time here, from 1858\n\n00:11:26.958 --> 00:11:28.958\nI start the world.\n\n00:11:28.958 --> 00:11:31.958\nAnd we shall see what will happen with these countries.\n\n00:11:31.958 --> 00:11:34.958\nYou see, China under foreign domination\n\n00:11:34.958 --> 00:11:37.958\nactually lowered their income and came down to the Indian level here.\n\n00:11:37.958 --> 00:11:41.958\nWhereas U.K. and United States is getting richer and richer.\n\n00:11:41.958 --> 00:11:44.958\nAnd after Second World War, United States is richer than U.K.\n\n00:11:44.958 --> 00:11:46.958\nBut independence is coming here.\n\n00:11:46.958 --> 00:11:48.958\nGrowth is starting, economic reform.\n\n00:11:48.958 --> 00:11:51.958\nGrowth is faster, and with projection from IMF\n\n00:11:51.958 --> 00:11:55.958\nyou can see where you expect them to be in 2014.\n\n00:11:55.958 --> 00:12:00.958\nNow, the question is, \"When will the catch up take place?\"\n\n00:12:00.958 --> 00:12:02.958\nLook at, look at the United States.\n\n00:12:02.958 --> 00:12:04.958\nCan you see the bubble?\n\n00:12:04.958 --> 00:12:06.958\nThe bubbles, not my bubbles,\n\n00:12:06.958 --> 00:12:08.958\nbut the financial bubbles.\n\n00:12:08.958 --> 00:12:13.958\nThat's the dot com bubble.

This is Japan coming up.\n\n00:12:34.958 --> 00:12:36.958\nYou see, Japan did it like that.\n\n00:12:36.958 --> 00:12:38.958\nWe add Japan to it.\n\n00:12:38.958 --> 00:12:41.958\nAnd there is no doubt that fast catch up\n\n00:12:41.958 --> 00:12:43.958\ncan take place.\n\n00:12:43.958 --> 00:12:45.958\nCan you see here what Japan did?\n\n00:12:45.958 --> 00:12:47.958\nJapan did it like this, until full catch up,\n\n00:12:47.958 --> 00:12:51.958\nand then they follow with the other high-income economies.\n\n00:12:51.958 --> 00:12:54.958\nBut the real projections for those ones,\n\n00:12:54.958 --> 00:12:59.958\nI would like to give it like this.\n\n00:12:59.958 --> 00:13:01.958\nCan be worse, can be better.\n\n00:13:01.958 --> 00:13:05.958\nIt's always difficult to predict, especially about the future.\n\n00:13:05.958 --> 00:13:08.958\nNow, a historian tells me it's even more difficult to predict about the past.\n\n00:13:08.958 --> 00:13:10.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:13:10.958 --> 00:13:13.958\nI think I'm in a difficult position here.\n\n00:13:13.958 --> 00:13:15.958\nInequalities in China and India\n\n00:13:15.958 --> 00:13:19.958\nI consider really the big obstacle\n\n00:13:19.958 --> 00:13:23.958\nbecause to bring the entire population into growth and prosperity\n\n00:13:23.958 --> 00:13:25.958\nis what will create a domestic market,\n\n00:13:25.958 --> 00:13:28.958\nwhat will avoid social instability,\n\n00:13:28.958 --> 00:13:31.958\nand which will make use of the entire capacity\n\n00:13:31.958 --> 00:13:33.958\nof the population.\n\n00:13:33.958 --> 00:13:37.958\nSo, social investments in health, education and infrastructure,\n\n00:13:37.958 --> 00:13:43.958\nand electricity is really what is needed in India and China.\n\n00:13:43.958 --> 00:13:46.958\nYou know the climate. We have great international experts\n\n00:13:46.958 --> 00:13:49.958\nwithin India telling us that the climate is changing,\n\n00:13:49.958 --> 00:13:51.958\nand actions has to be taken,\n\n00:13:51.958 --> 00:13:54.958\notherwise China and India would be the countries\n\n00:13:54.958 --> 00:13:56.958\nmost to suffer from climate change.\n\n00:13:56.958 --> 00:13:59.958\nAnd I consider India and China the best partners in the world\n\n00:13:59.958 --> 00:14:02.958\nin a good global climate policy.\n\n00:14:02.958 --> 00:14:04.958\nBut they ain't going to pay\n\n00:14:04.958 --> 00:14:06.958\nfor what others, who have more money,\n\n00:14:06.958 --> 00:14:09.958\nhave largely created, and I can agree on that.\n\n00:14:09.958 --> 00:14:12.958\nBut what I'm really worried about is war.\n\n00:14:12.958 --> 00:14:14.958\nWill the former rich countries really accept\n\n00:14:14.958 --> 00:14:17.958\na completely changed world economy,\n\n00:14:17.958 --> 00:14:20.958\nand a shift of power away from where it has been\n\n00:14:20.958 --> 00:14:22.958\nthe last 50 to 100 to 150 years,\n\n00:14:22.958 --> 00:14:24.958\nback to Asia?\n\n00:14:24.958 --> 00:14:26.958\nAnd will Asia be able to handle that\n\n00:14:26.958 --> 00:14:28.958\nnew position of being in charge\n\n00:14:28.958 --> 00:14:31.958\nof being the most mighty, and the governors of the world?\n\n00:14:31.958 --> 00:14:33.958\nSo, always avoid war,\n\n00:14:33.958 --> 00:14:36.958\nbecause that always pushes human beings backward.\n\n00:14:36.958 --> 00:14:40.958\nNow if these inequalities, climate and war can be avoided,\n\n00:14:40.958 --> 00:14:43.958\nget ready for a world in equity,\n\n00:14:43.958 --> 00:14:46.958\nbecause this is what seems to be happening.\n\n00:14:46.958 --> 00:14:48.958\nAnd that vision that I got as a young student,\n\n00:14:48.958 --> 00:14:54.958\n1972, that Indians can be much better than Swedes,\n\n00:14:54.958 --> 00:14:56.958\nis just about to happen.\n\n00:14:56.958 --> 00:14:59.958\nAnd it will happen precisely\n\n00:14:59.958 --> 00:15:03.958\nthe year 2048\n\n00:15:03.958 --> 00:15:06.958\nin the later part of the summer, in July,\n\n00:15:06.958 --> 00:15:09.958\nmore precisely, the 27th of July.\n\n00:15:09.958 --> 00:15:17.958\n(Applause)\n\n00:15:17.958 --> 00:15:21.958\nThe 27th of July, 2048\n\n00:15:21.958 --> 00:15:23.958\nis my 100th birthday.\n\n00:15:23.958 --> 00:15:25.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:15:25.958 --> 00:15:27.958\nAnd I expect to speak\n\n00:15:27.958 --> 00:15:31.958\nin the first session of the 39th TED India.\n\n00:15:31.958 --> 00:15:34.958\nGet your bookings in time.

Some of those stories are that somebody is just going to sort everything out for us. Other stories are that everything is on the verge of unraveling.But I want to tell you a different story here today. Like all stories, it has a beginning. My work, for a long time, has been involved in education, in teaching people practical skills for sustainability, teaching people how to take responsibility for growing some of their own food, how to build buildings using local materials, how to generate their own energy, and so on.I lived in Ireland, built the first straw-bale houses in Ireland, and some cob buildings and all this kind of thing. But all my work for many years was focused around the idea that sustainability means basically looking at the globalized economic growth model, and moderating what comes in at one end, and moderating the outputs at the other end. And then I came into contact with a way of looking at things which actually changed that profoundly.And in order to introduce you to that, I've got something here that I'm going to unveil, which is one of the great marvels of the modern age. And it's something so astounding and so astonishing that I think maybe as I remove this cloth a suitable gasp of amazement might be appropriate. If you could help me with that it would be fantastic. (Laughter) This is a liter of oil.This bottle of oil, distilled over a hundred million years of geological time, ancient sunlight, contains the energy equivalent of about five weeks hard human manual labor \u2014 equivalent to about 35 strong people coming round and working for you. We can turn it into a dazzling array of materials, medicine, modern clothing, laptops, a whole range of different things. It gives us an energy return that's unimaginable, historically. We've based the design of our settlements, our business models, our transport plans, even the idea of economic growth, some would argue, on the assumption that we will have this in perpetuity.Yet, when we take a step back, and look over the span of history, at what we might call the petroleum interval, it's a short period in history where we've discovered this extraordinary material, and then based a whole way of life around it. But as we straddle the top of this energy mountain, at this stage, we move from a time where our economic success, our sense of individual prowess and well-being is directly linked to how much of this we consume, to a time when actually our degree of oil dependency is our degree of vulnerability.And it's increasingly clear that we aren't going to be able to rely on the fact that we're going to have this at our disposal forever. For every four barrels of oil that we consume, we only discover one. And that gap continues to widen. There is also the fact that the amount of energy that we get back from the oil that we discover is falling. In the 1930s we got 100 units of energy back for every one that we put in to extract it. Completely unprecedented, historically. Already that's fallen to about 11. And that's why, now, the new breakthroughs, the new frontiers in terms of oil extraction are scrambling about in Alberta, or at the bottom of the oceans.There are 98 oil-producing nations in the world. But of those, 65 have already passed their peak. The moment when the world on average passes this peak, people wonder when that's going to happen. And there is an emerging case that maybe that was what happened last July when the oil prices were so high.But are we to assume that the same brilliance and creativity and adaptability that got us up to the top of that energy mountain in the first place is somehow mysteriously going to evaporate when we have to design a creative way back down the other side? No. But the thinking that we have to come up with has to be based on a realistic assessment of where we are.There is also the issue of climate change, is the other thing that underpins this transition approach. But the thing that I notice, as I talk to climate scientists, is the increasingly terrified look they have in their eyes, as the data that's coming in, which is far ahead of what the IPCC are talking about. So the IPCC said that we might see significant breakup of the arctic ice in 2100, in their worst case scenario. Actually, if current trends continue, it could all be gone in five or 10 years' time. If just three percent of the carbon locked up in the arctic permafrost is released as the world warms, it would offset all the savings that we need to make, in carbon, over the next 40 years to avoid runaway climate change. We have no choice other than deep and urgent decarbonization.But I'm always very interested to think about what might the stories be that the generations further down the slope from us are going to tell about us. \"The generation that lived at the top of the mountain, that partied so hard, and so abused its inheritance.\" And one of the ways I like to do that is to look back at the stories people used to tell before we had cheap oil, before we had fossil fuels, and people relied on their own muscle, animal muscle energy, or a little bit of wind, little bit of water energy.We had stories like \"The Seven-League Boots\": the giant who had these boots, where, once you put them on, with every stride you could cover seven leagues, or 21 miles, a kind of travel completely unimaginable to people without that kind of energy at their disposal.Stories like The Magic Porridge Pot, where you had a pot where if you knew the magic words, this pot would just make as much food as you liked, without you having to do any work, provided you could remember the other magic word to stop it making porridge. Otherwise you'd flood your entire town with warm porridge.There is the story of \"The Elves and the Shoemaker.\" The people who make shoes go to sleep, wake up in the morning, and all the shoes are magically made for them. It's something that was unimaginable to people then.Now we have the seven-league boots in the form of Ryanair and Easyjet. We have the magic porridge pot in the form of Walmart and Tesco. And we have the elves in the form of China. But we don't appreciate what an astonishing thing that has been.And what are the stories that we tell ourselves now, as we look forward about where we're going to go. And I would argue that there are four. There is the idea of business as usual, that the future will be like the present, just more of it. But as we've seen over the last year, I think that's an idea that is increasingly coming into question. And in terms of climate change, is something that is not actually feasible.There is the idea of hitting the wall, that actually somehow everything is so fragile that it might just all unravel and collapse. This is a popular story in some places. The third story is the idea that technology can solve everything, that technology can somehow get us through this completely.And it's an idea that I think is very prevalent at these TED Talks, the idea that we can invent our way out of a profound economic and energy crisis, that a move to a knowledge economy can somehow neatly sidestep those energy constraints, the idea that we'll discover some fabulous new source of energy that will mean we can sweep all concerns about energy security to one side, the idea that we can step off neatly onto a completely renewable world.But the world isn't Second Life. We can't create new land and new energy systems at the click of a mouse. And as we sit, exchanging free ideas with each other, there are still people mining coal in order to power the servers, extracting the minerals to make all of those things. The breakfast that we eat as we sit down to check our email in the morning is still transported at great distances, usually at the expense of the local, more resilient food systems that would have supplied that in the past, which we've so effectively devalued and dismantled.We can be astonishingly inventive and creative. But we also live in a world with very real constraints and demands. Energy and technology are not the same thing. What I'm involved with is the transition response. And this is really about looking the challenges of peak oil and climate change square in the face, and responding with a creativity and an adaptability and an imagination that we really need. It's something which has spread incredibly fast. And it is something which has several characteristics.It's viral. It seems to spread under the radar very, very quickly. It's open source. It's something which everybody who's involved with it develops and passes on as they work with it. It's self-organizing. There is no great central organization that pushes this; people just pick up an idea and they run with it, and they implement it where they are. It's solutions-focused. It's very much looking at what people can do where they are, to respond to this. It's sensitive to place and to scale.Transitional is completely different. Transition groups in Chile, transition groups in the U.S., transition groups here, what they're doing looks very different in every place that you go to. It learns very much from its mistakes. And it feels historic. It tries to create a sense that this is a historic opportunity to do something really extraordinary. And it's a process which is really joyful. People have a huge amount of fun doing this, reconnecting with other people as they do it. One of the things that underpins it is this idea of resilience.And I think, in many ways, the idea of resilience is a more useful concept than the idea of sustainability. The idea of resilience comes from the study of ecology. And it's really about how systems, settlements, withstand shock from the outside. When they encounter shock from the outside that they don't just unravel and fall to pieces. And I think it's a more useful concept than sustainability, as I said.When our supermarkets have only two or three days' worth of food in them at any one time, often sustainability tends to focus on the energy efficiency of the freezers and on the packaging that the lettuces are wrapped up in. Looking through the lens of resilience, we really question how we've let ourselves get into a situation that's so vulnerable. Resilience runs much deeper: it's about building modularity into what we do, building surge breakers into how we organize the basic things that support us.This is a photograph of the Bristol and District Market Gardeners Association, in 1897. This is at a time when the city of Bristol, which is quite close to here, was surrounded by commercial market gardens, which provided a significant amount of the food that was consumed in the town, and created a lot of employment for people, as well. There was a degree of resilience, if you like, at that time, which we can now only look back on with envy.So how does this transition idea work? So basically, you have a group of people who are excited by the idea. They pick up some of the tools that we've developed. They start to run an awareness-raising program looking at how this might actually work in the town. They show films, they give talks, and so on. It's a process which is playful and creative and informative. Then they start to form working groups, looking at different aspects of this, and then from that, there emerge a whole lot of projects which then the transition project itself starts to support and enable.So it started out with some work I was involved in in Ireland, where I was teaching, and has since spread. There are now over 200 formal transition projects. And there are thousands of others who are at what we call the mulling stage. They are mulling whether they're going to take it further. And actually a lot of them are doing huge amounts of stuff. But what do they actually do? You know, it's a kind of nice idea, but what do they actually do on the ground?Well, I think it's really important to make the point that actually you know, this isn't something which is going to do everything on its own. We need international legislation from Copenhagen and so on. We need national responses. We need local government responses. But all of those things are going to be much easier if we have communities that are vibrant and coming up with ideas and leading from the front, making unelectable policies electable, over the next 5 to 10 years.Some of the things that emerge from it are local food projects, like community-supported agriculture schemes, urban food production, creating local food directories, and so on. A lot of places now are starting to set up their own energy companies, community-owned energy companies, where the community can invest money into itself, to start putting in place the kind of renewable energy infrastructure that we need. A lot of places are working with their local schools. Newent in the Forest of Dean: big polytunnel they built for the school; the kids are learning how to grow food. Promoting recycling, things like garden-share, that matches up people who don't have a garden who would like to grow food, with people who have gardens they aren't using anymore. Planting productive trees throughout urban spaces. And also starting to play around with the idea of alternative currencies.This is Lewes in Sussex, who have recently launched the Lewes Pound, a currency that you can only spend within the town, as a way of starting to cycle money within the local economy. You take it anywhere else, it's not worth anything. But actually within the town you start to create these economic cycles much more effectively.Another thing that they do is what we call an energy descent plan, which is basically to develop a plan B for the town. Most of our local authorities, when they sit down to plan for the next five, 10, 15, 20 years of a community, still start by assuming that there will be more energy, more cars, more housing, more jobs, more growth, and so on. What does it look like if that's not the case? And how can we embrace that and actually come up with something that was actually more likely to sustain everybody? As a friend of mine says, \"Life is a series of things you're not quite ready for.\" And that's certainly been my experience with transition. From three years ago, it just being an idea, this has become something that has virally swept around the world. We're getting a lot of interest from government. Ed Miliband, the energy minister of this country, was invited to come to our recent conference as a keynote listener. Which he did \u2014 (Laughter) (Applause) \u2014 and has since become a great advocate of the whole idea.There are now two local authorities in this country who have declared themselves transitional local authorities, Leicestershire and Somerset. And in Stroud, the transition group there, in effect, wrote the local government's food plan. And the head of the council said, \"If we didn't have Transition Stroud, we would have to invent all of that community infrastructure for the first time.\" As we see the spread of it, we see national hubs emerging.In Scotland, the Scottish government's climate change fund has funded Transition Scotland as a national organization supporting the spread of this. And we see it all over the place as well now. But the key to transition is thinking not that we have to change everything now, but that things are already inevitably changing, and what we need to do is to work creatively with that, based on asking the right questions.I think I'd like to just return at the end to the idea of stories. Because I think stories are vital here. And actually the stories that we tell ourselves, we have a huge dearth of stories about how to move forward creatively from here. And one of the key things that transition does is to pull those stories out of what people are doing. Stories about the community that's produced its own 21 pound note, for example, the school that's turned its car park into a food garden, the community that's founded its own energy company. And for me, one of the great stories recently was the Obamas digging up the south lawn of the White House to create a vegetable garden. Because the last time that was done, when Eleanor Roosevelt did it, it led to the creation of 20 million vegetable gardens across the United States.So the question I'd like to leave you with, really, is \u2014 for all aspects of the things that your community needs in order to thrive, how can it be done in such a way that drastically reduces its carbon emissions, while also building resilience?Personally, I feel enormously grateful to have lived through the age of cheap oil. I've been astonishingly lucky, we've been astonishingly lucky. But let us honor what it has bought us, and move forward from this point. Because if we cling to it, and continue to assume that it can underpin our choices, the future that it presents to us is one which is really unmanageable. And by loving and leaving all that oil has done for us, and that the Oil Age has done for us, we are able to then begin the creation of a world which is more resilient, more nourishing, and in which, we find ourselves fitter, more skilled and more connected to each other. Thank you very much.

00:01:44.958\nThis bottle of oil,\n\n00:01:44.958 --> 00:01:47.958\ndistilled over a hundred million years of geological time,\n\n00:01:47.958 --> 00:01:49.958\nancient sunlight,\n\n00:01:49.958 --> 00:01:51.958\ncontains the energy equivalent of about five weeks\n\n00:01:51.958 --> 00:01:54.958\nhard human manual labor --\n\n00:01:54.958 --> 00:01:58.958\nequivalent to about 35 strong people\n\n00:01:58.958 --> 00:02:01.958\ncoming round and working for you.\n\n00:02:01.958 --> 00:02:05.958\nWe can turn it into a dazzling array of materials,\n\n00:02:05.958 --> 00:02:07.958\nmedicine, modern clothing,\n\n00:02:07.958 --> 00:02:11.958\nlaptops, a whole range of different things.\n\n00:02:11.958 --> 00:02:16.958\nIt gives us an energy return that's unimaginable, historically.\n\n00:02:16.958 --> 00:02:18.958\nWe've based the design of our settlements,\n\n00:02:18.958 --> 00:02:20.958\nour business models, our transport plans,\n\n00:02:20.958 --> 00:02:23.958\neven the idea of economic growth, some would argue,\n\n00:02:23.958 --> 00:02:27.958\non the assumption that we will have this in perpetuity.\n\n00:02:27.958 --> 00:02:30.958\nYet, when we take a step back,\n\n00:02:30.958 --> 00:02:32.958\nand look over the span of history,\n\n00:02:32.958 --> 00:02:35.958\nat what we might call the petroleum interval,\n\n00:02:35.958 --> 00:02:37.958\nit's a short period in history\n\n00:02:37.958 --> 00:02:40.958\nwhere we've discovered this extraordinary material,\n\n00:02:40.958 --> 00:02:43.958\nand then based a whole way of life around it.\n\n00:02:43.958 --> 00:02:47.958\nBut as we straddle the top of this energy mountain, at this stage,\n\n00:02:47.958 --> 00:02:50.958\nwe move from a time where our economic success,\n\n00:02:50.958 --> 00:02:53.958\nour sense of individual prowess and well-being\n\n00:02:53.958 --> 00:02:57.958\nis directly linked to how much of this we consume,\n\n00:02:57.958 --> 00:03:00.958\nto a time when actually our degree of oil dependency\n\n00:03:00.958 --> 00:03:02.958\nis our degree of vulnerability.\n\n00:03:02.958 --> 00:03:04.958\nAnd it's increasingly clear that we\n\n00:03:04.958 --> 00:03:06.958\naren't going to be able to rely on the fact that\n\n00:03:06.958 --> 00:03:09.958\nwe're going to have this at our disposal forever.\n\n00:03:09.958 --> 00:03:11.958\nFor every four barrels of oil that we consume,\n\n00:03:11.958 --> 00:03:13.958\nwe only discover one.\n\n00:03:13.958 --> 00:03:15.958\nAnd that gap continues to widen.\n\n00:03:15.958 --> 00:03:17.958\nThere is also the fact that the amount of energy\n\n00:03:17.958 --> 00:03:20.958\nthat we get back from the oil that we discover is falling.\n\n00:03:20.958 --> 00:03:23.958\nIn the 1930s we got 100 units of energy back\n\n00:03:23.958 --> 00:03:26.958\nfor every one that we put in to extract it.\n\n00:03:26.958 --> 00:03:28.958\nCompletely unprecedented, historically.\n\n00:03:28.958 --> 00:03:30.958\nAlready that's fallen to about 11.\n\n00:03:30.958 --> 00:03:32.958\nAnd that's why, now,\n\n00:03:32.958 --> 00:03:34.958\nthe new breakthroughs, the new frontiers\n\n00:03:34.958 --> 00:03:37.958\nin terms of oil extraction are scrambling about in Alberta,\n\n00:03:37.958 --> 00:03:39.958\nor at the bottom of the oceans.\n\n00:03:39.958 --> 00:03:42.958\nThere are 98 oil-producing nations in the world.\n\n00:03:42.958 --> 00:03:45.958\nBut of those, 65 have already passed their peak.\n\n00:03:45.958 --> 00:03:48.958\nThe moment when the world on average passes this peak,\n\n00:03:48.958 --> 00:03:50.958\npeople wonder when that's going to happen.\n\n00:03:50.958 --> 00:03:51.958\nAnd there is an emerging case\n\n00:03:51.958 --> 00:03:53.958\nthat maybe that was what happened last July\n\n00:03:53.958 --> 00:03:55.958\nwhen the oil prices were so high.\n\n00:03:55.958 --> 00:03:57.958\nBut are we to assume that the same brilliance\n\n00:03:57.958 --> 00:03:59.958\nand creativity and adaptability\n\n00:03:59.958 --> 00:04:02.958\nthat got us up to the top of that energy mountain in the first place\n\n00:04:02.958 --> 00:04:05.958\nis somehow mysteriously going to evaporate\n\n00:04:05.958 --> 00:04:09.958\nwhen we have to design a creative way back down the other side?\n\n00:04:09.958 --> 00:04:12.958\nNo. But the thinking that we have to come up with\n\n00:04:12.958 --> 00:04:15.958\nhas to be based on a realistic assessment\n\n00:04:15.958 --> 00:04:17.958\nof where we are.\n\n00:04:17.958 --> 00:04:19.958\nThere is also the issue of climate change,\n\n00:04:19.958 --> 00:04:21.958\nis the other thing that underpins this transition approach.\n\n00:04:21.958 --> 00:04:24.958\nBut the thing that I notice, as I talk to climate scientists,\n\n00:04:24.958 --> 00:04:27.958\nis the increasingly terrified look they have in their eyes,\n\n00:04:27.958 --> 00:04:29.958\nas the data that's coming in,\n\n00:04:29.958 --> 00:04:33.958\nwhich is far ahead of what the IPCC are talking about.\n\n00:04:33.958 --> 00:04:35.958\nSo the IPCC said\n\n00:04:35.958 --> 00:04:37.958\nthat we might see significant breakup\n\n00:04:37.958 --> 00:04:40.958\nof the arctic ice in 2100, in their worst case scenario.\n\n00:04:40.958 --> 00:04:43.958\nActually, if current trends continue,\n\n00:04:43.958 --> 00:04:45.958\nit could all be gone in five or 10 years' time.\n\n00:04:45.958 --> 00:04:49.958\nIf just three percent of the carbon locked up in the arctic permafrost\n\n00:04:49.958 --> 00:04:51.958\nis released as the world warms,\n\n00:04:51.958 --> 00:04:53.958\nit would offset all the savings that we need to make,\n\n00:04:53.958 --> 00:04:56.958\nin carbon, over the next 40 years to avoid runaway climate change.\n\n00:04:56.958 --> 00:05:01.958\nWe have no choice other than deep and urgent decarbonization.\n\n00:05:01.958 --> 00:05:03.958\nBut I'm always very interested to think about\n\n00:05:03.958 --> 00:05:05.958\nwhat might the stories be\n\n00:05:05.958 --> 00:05:08.958\nthat the generations further down the slope from us\n\n00:05:08.958 --> 00:05:10.958\nare going to tell about us.\n\n00:05:10.958 --> 00:05:13.958\n\"The generation that lived at the top of the mountain,\n\n00:05:13.958 --> 00:05:18.958\nthat partied so hard, and so abused its inheritance.\"\n\n00:05:18.958 --> 00:05:20.958\nAnd one of the ways I like to do that\n\n00:05:20.958 --> 00:05:22.958\nis to look back at the stories people used to tell\n\n00:05:22.958 --> 00:05:25.958\nbefore we had cheap oil, before we had fossil fuels,\n\n00:05:25.958 --> 00:05:28.958\nand people relied on their own muscle, animal muscle energy,\n\n00:05:28.958 --> 00:05:31.958\nor a little bit of wind, little bit of water energy.\n\n00:05:31.958 --> 00:05:34.958\nWe had stories like \"The Seven-League Boots\":\n\n00:05:34.958 --> 00:05:36.958\nthe giant who had these boots, where, once you put them on,\n\n00:05:36.958 --> 00:05:40.958\nwith every stride you could cover seven leagues, or 21 miles,\n\n00:05:40.958 --> 00:05:42.958\na kind of travel completely unimaginable\n\n00:05:42.958 --> 00:05:45.958\nto people without that kind of energy at their disposal.\n\n00:05:45.958 --> 00:05:48.958\nStories like The Magic Porridge Pot,\n\n00:05:48.958 --> 00:05:50.958\nwhere you had a pot where if you knew the magic words,\n\n00:05:50.958 --> 00:05:53.958\nthis pot would just make as much food as you liked,\n\n00:05:53.958 --> 00:05:55.958\nwithout you having to do any work,\n\n00:05:55.958 --> 00:05:58.958\nprovided you could remember the other magic word to stop it making porridge.\n\n00:05:58.958 --> 00:06:02.958\nOtherwise you'd flood your entire town with warm porridge.\n\n00:06:02.958 --> 00:06:05.958\nThere is the story of \"The Elves and the Shoemaker.\"\n\n00:06:05.958 --> 00:06:07.958\nThe people who make shoes go to sleep, wake up in the morning,\n\n00:06:07.958 --> 00:06:09.958\nand all the shoes are magically made for them.\n\n00:06:09.958 --> 00:06:12.958\nIt's something that was unimaginable to people then.\n\n00:06:12.958 --> 00:06:15.958\nNow we have the seven-league boots\n\n00:06:15.958 --> 00:06:18.958\nin the form of Ryanair and Easyjet.\n\n00:06:18.958 --> 00:06:20.958\nWe have the magic porridge pot\n\n00:06:20.958 --> 00:06:22.958\nin the form of Walmart and Tesco.\n\n00:06:22.958 --> 00:06:25.958\nAnd we have the elves in the form of China.\n\n00:06:25.958 --> 00:06:29.958\nBut we don't appreciate what an astonishing\n\n00:06:29.958 --> 00:06:31.958\nthing that has been.\n\n00:06:31.958 --> 00:06:33.958\nAnd what are the stories that we tell ourselves now,\n\n00:06:33.958 --> 00:06:36.958\nas we look forward about where we're going to go.\n\n00:06:36.958 --> 00:06:39.958\nAnd I would argue that there are four. There is the idea of business as usual,\n\n00:06:39.958 --> 00:06:42.958\nthat the future will be like the present, just more of it.\n\n00:06:42.958 --> 00:06:44.958\nBut as we've seen over the last year, I think that's an idea\n\n00:06:44.958 --> 00:06:46.958\nthat is increasingly coming into question.\n\n00:06:46.958 --> 00:06:48.958\nAnd in terms of climate change,\n\n00:06:48.958 --> 00:06:52.958\nis something that is not actually feasible.\n\n00:06:52.958 --> 00:06:54.958\nThere is the idea of hitting the wall,\n\n00:06:54.958 --> 00:06:57.958\nthat actually somehow everything is so fragile\n\n00:06:57.958 --> 00:06:59.958\nthat it might just all unravel and collapse.\n\n00:06:59.958 --> 00:07:02.958\nThis is a popular story in some places.\n\n00:07:02.958 --> 00:07:05.958\nThe third story is the idea that technology can solve everything,\n\n00:07:05.958 --> 00:07:09.958\nthat technology can somehow get us through this completely.\n\n00:07:09.958 --> 00:07:13.958\nAnd it's an idea that I think is very prevalent at these TED Talks,\n\n00:07:13.958 --> 00:07:16.958\nthe idea that we can invent our way out of a profound\n\n00:07:16.958 --> 00:07:18.958\neconomic and energy crisis,\n\n00:07:18.958 --> 00:07:20.958\nthat a move to a knowledge economy\n\n00:07:20.958 --> 00:07:23.958\ncan somehow neatly sidestep those energy constraints,\n\n00:07:23.958 --> 00:07:26.958\nthe idea that we'll discover some fabulous new source of energy\n\n00:07:26.958 --> 00:07:28.958\nthat will mean we can sweep all concerns\n\n00:07:28.958 --> 00:07:31.958\nabout energy security to one side,\n\n00:07:31.958 --> 00:07:33.958\nthe idea that we can step off neatly\n\n00:07:33.958 --> 00:07:35.958\nonto a completely renewable world.\n\n00:07:35.958 --> 00:07:37.958\nBut the world isn't Second Life.\n\n00:07:37.958 --> 00:07:41.958\nWe can't create new land and new energy systems at the click of a mouse.\n\n00:07:41.958 --> 00:07:44.958\nAnd as we sit, exchanging free ideas with each other,\n\n00:07:44.958 --> 00:07:46.958\nthere are still people mining coal\n\n00:07:46.958 --> 00:07:48.958\nin order to power the servers, extracting the minerals\n\n00:07:48.958 --> 00:07:50.958\nto make all of those things.\n\n00:07:50.958 --> 00:07:52.958\nThe breakfast that we eat as we sit down\n\n00:07:52.958 --> 00:07:54.958\nto check our email in the morning\n\n00:07:54.958 --> 00:07:56.958\nis still transported at great distances,\n\n00:07:56.958 --> 00:07:58.958\nusually at the expense of the local, more resilient\n\n00:07:58.958 --> 00:08:01.958\nfood systems that would have supplied that in the past,\n\n00:08:01.958 --> 00:08:05.958\nwhich we've so effectively devalued and dismantled.\n\n00:08:05.958 --> 00:08:08.958\nWe can be astonishingly inventive and creative.\n\n00:08:08.958 --> 00:08:12.958\nBut we also live in a world with very real constraints and demands.\n\n00:08:12.958 --> 00:08:15.958\nEnergy and technology are not the same thing.\n\n00:08:15.958 --> 00:08:17.958\nWhat I'm involved with is the transition response.\n\n00:08:17.958 --> 00:08:20.958\nAnd this is really about looking the challenges\n\n00:08:20.958 --> 00:08:22.958\nof peak oil and climate change square in the face,\n\n00:08:22.958 --> 00:08:25.958\nand responding with a creativity and an adaptability\n\n00:08:25.958 --> 00:08:28.958\nand an imagination that we really need.\n\n00:08:28.958 --> 00:08:31.958\nIt's something which has spread incredibly fast.\n\n00:08:31.958 --> 00:08:33.958\nAnd it is something which has several characteristics.\n\n00:08:33.958 --> 00:08:38.958\nIt's viral. It seems to spread under the radar very, very quickly.\n\n00:08:38.958 --> 00:08:42.958\nIt's open source. It's something which everybody who's involved with it\n\n00:08:42.958 --> 00:08:46.958\ndevelops and passes on as they work with it.\n\n00:08:46.958 --> 00:08:49.958\nIt's self-organizing. There is no great central organization\n\n00:08:49.958 --> 00:08:51.958\nthat pushes this; people just pick up an idea\n\n00:08:51.958 --> 00:08:54.958\nand they run with it, and they implement it where they are.\n\n00:08:54.958 --> 00:08:57.958\nIt's solutions-focused. It's very much looking at what people can do\n\n00:08:57.958 --> 00:09:00.958\nwhere they are, to respond to this.\n\n00:09:00.958 --> 00:09:02.958\nIt's sensitive to place and to scale.\n\n00:09:02.958 --> 00:09:04.958\nTransitional is completely different.\n\n00:09:04.958 --> 00:09:08.958\nTransition groups in Chile, transition groups in the U.S., transition groups here,\n\n00:09:08.958 --> 00:09:11.958\nwhat they're doing looks very different in every place that you go to.\n\n00:09:11.958 --> 00:09:13.958\nIt learns very much from its mistakes.\n\n00:09:13.958 --> 00:09:16.958\nAnd it feels historic. It tries to create a sense\n\n00:09:16.958 --> 00:09:18.958\nthat this is a historic opportunity\n\n00:09:18.958 --> 00:09:20.958\nto do something really extraordinary.\n\n00:09:20.958 --> 00:09:22.958\nAnd it's a process which is really joyful.\n\n00:09:22.958 --> 00:09:24.958\nPeople have a huge amount of fun doing this,\n\n00:09:24.958 --> 00:09:27.958\nreconnecting with other people as they do it.\n\n00:09:27.958 --> 00:09:30.958\nOne of the things that underpins it is this idea of resilience.\n\n00:09:30.958 --> 00:09:33.958\nAnd I think, in many ways, the idea of resilience\n\n00:09:33.958 --> 00:09:37.958\nis a more useful concept than the idea of sustainability.\n\n00:09:37.958 --> 00:09:39.958\nThe idea of resilience comes from the study of ecology.\n\n00:09:39.958 --> 00:09:42.958\nAnd it's really about how systems,\n\n00:09:42.958 --> 00:09:45.958\nsettlements, withstand shock from the outside.\n\n00:09:45.958 --> 00:09:47.958\nWhen they encounter shock from the outside\n\n00:09:47.958 --> 00:09:49.958\nthat they don't just unravel and fall to pieces.\n\n00:09:49.958 --> 00:09:53.958\nAnd I think it's a more useful concept than sustainability, as I said.\n\n00:09:53.958 --> 00:09:57.958\nWhen our supermarkets have only two or three days' worth of food in them\n\n00:09:57.958 --> 00:10:00.958\nat any one time, often sustainability tends to focus on\n\n00:10:00.958 --> 00:10:02.958\nthe energy efficiency of the freezers\n\n00:10:02.958 --> 00:10:05.958\nand on the packaging that the lettuces are wrapped up in.\n\n00:10:05.958 --> 00:10:07.958\nLooking through the lens of resilience,\n\n00:10:07.958 --> 00:10:11.958\nwe really question how we've let ourselves get into a situation\n\n00:10:11.958 --> 00:10:13.958\nthat's so vulnerable.\n\n00:10:13.958 --> 00:10:15.958\nResilience runs much deeper:\n\n00:10:15.958 --> 00:10:17.958\nit's about building modularity into what we do,\n\n00:10:17.958 --> 00:10:22.958\nbuilding surge breakers into how we organize the basic things that support us.\n\n00:10:22.958 --> 00:10:24.958\nThis is a photograph of the Bristol and District\n\n00:10:24.958 --> 00:10:28.958\nMarket Gardeners Association, in 1897.\n\n00:10:28.958 --> 00:10:30.958\nThis is at a time when the city of Bristol,\n\n00:10:30.958 --> 00:10:32.958\nwhich is quite close to here,\n\n00:10:32.958 --> 00:10:34.958\nwas surrounded by commercial market gardens,\n\n00:10:34.958 --> 00:10:37.958\nwhich provided a significant amount of the food\n\n00:10:37.958 --> 00:10:41.958\nthat was consumed in the town, and created a lot of employment for people, as well.\n\n00:10:41.958 --> 00:10:44.958\nThere was a degree of resilience, if you like, at that time,\n\n00:10:44.958 --> 00:10:48.958\nwhich we can now only look back on with envy.\n\n00:10:48.958 --> 00:10:50.958\nSo how does this transition idea work?\n\n00:10:50.958 --> 00:10:53.958\nSo basically, you have a group of people who are excited by the idea.\n\n00:10:53.958 --> 00:10:56.958\nThey pick up some of the tools that we've developed.\n\n00:10:56.958 --> 00:10:58.958\nThey start to run an awareness-raising program\n\n00:10:58.958 --> 00:11:01.958\nlooking at how this might actually work in the town.\n\n00:11:01.958 --> 00:11:03.958\nThey show films, they give talks, and so on.\n\n00:11:03.958 --> 00:11:06.958\nIt's a process which is playful and creative\n\n00:11:06.958 --> 00:11:08.958\nand informative.\n\n00:11:08.958 --> 00:11:11.958\nThen they start to form working groups, looking at different aspects of this,\n\n00:11:11.958 --> 00:11:14.958\nand then from that, there emerge a whole lot of projects\n\n00:11:14.958 --> 00:11:16.958\nwhich then the transition project itself\n\n00:11:16.958 --> 00:11:21.958\nstarts to support and enable.\n\n00:11:21.958 --> 00:11:23.958\nSo it started out with some work I was involved in in Ireland,\n\n00:11:23.958 --> 00:11:25.958\nwhere I was teaching, and has since spread.\n\n00:11:25.958 --> 00:11:28.958\nThere are now over 200 formal transition projects.\n\n00:11:28.958 --> 00:11:32.958\nAnd there are thousands of others who are at what we call the mulling stage.\n\n00:11:32.958 --> 00:11:34.958\nThey are mulling whether they're going to take it further.\n\n00:11:34.958 --> 00:11:37.958\nAnd actually a lot of them are doing huge amounts of stuff.\n\n00:11:37.958 --> 00:11:39.958\nBut what do they actually do? You know, it's a kind of nice idea,\n\n00:11:39.958 --> 00:11:41.958\nbut what do they actually do on the ground?\n\n00:11:41.958 --> 00:11:45.958\nWell, I think it's really important to make the point that actually\n\n00:11:45.958 --> 00:11:48.958\nyou know, this isn't something which is going to do everything on its own.\n\n00:11:48.958 --> 00:11:52.958\nWe need international legislation from Copenhagen and so on.\n\n00:11:52.958 --> 00:11:55.958\nWe need national responses. We need local government responses.\n\n00:11:55.958 --> 00:11:58.958\nBut all of those things are going to be much easier\n\n00:11:58.958 --> 00:12:01.958\nif we have communities that are vibrant and coming up with ideas\n\n00:12:01.958 --> 00:12:04.958\nand leading from the front, making unelectable policies electable,\n\n00:12:04.958 --> 00:12:06.958\nover the next 5 to 10 years.\n\n00:12:06.958 --> 00:12:09.958\nSome of the things that emerge from it are local food projects,\n\n00:12:09.958 --> 00:12:11.958\nlike community-supported agriculture schemes,\n\n00:12:11.958 --> 00:12:15.958\nurban food production, creating local food directories, and so on.\n\n00:12:15.958 --> 00:12:18.958\nA lot of places now are starting to set up their own energy companies,\n\n00:12:18.958 --> 00:12:20.958\ncommunity-owned energy companies,\n\n00:12:20.958 --> 00:12:22.958\nwhere the community can invest money into itself,\n\n00:12:22.958 --> 00:12:24.958\nto start putting in place\n\n00:12:24.958 --> 00:12:26.958\nthe kind of renewable energy infrastructure that we need.\n\n00:12:26.958 --> 00:12:29.958\nA lot of places are working with their local schools.\n\n00:12:29.958 --> 00:12:31.958\nNewent in the Forest of Dean: big polytunnel they built for the school;\n\n00:12:31.958 --> 00:12:33.958\nthe kids are learning how to grow food.\n\n00:12:33.958 --> 00:12:36.958\nPromoting recycling, things like garden-share,\n\n00:12:36.958 --> 00:12:38.958\nthat matches up people who don't have a garden\n\n00:12:38.958 --> 00:12:41.958\nwho would like to grow food, with people who have gardens they aren't using anymore.\n\n00:12:41.958 --> 00:12:44.958\nPlanting productive trees throughout urban spaces.\n\n00:12:44.958 --> 00:12:46.958\nAnd also starting to play around with the idea of\n\n00:12:46.958 --> 00:12:48.958\nalternative currencies.\n\n00:12:48.958 --> 00:12:50.958\nThis is Lewes in Sussex,\n\n00:12:50.958 --> 00:12:53.958\nwho have recently launched the Lewes Pound,\n\n00:12:53.958 --> 00:12:55.958\na currency that you can only spend within the town,\n\n00:12:55.958 --> 00:12:58.958\nas a way of starting to cycle money within the local economy.\n\n00:12:58.958 --> 00:13:00.958\nYou take it anywhere else, it's not worth anything.\n\n00:13:00.958 --> 00:13:03.958\nBut actually within the town you start to create these economic\n\n00:13:03.958 --> 00:13:06.958\ncycles much more effectively.\n\n00:13:06.958 --> 00:13:08.958\nAnother thing that they do is what we call an energy descent plan,\n\n00:13:08.958 --> 00:13:11.958\nwhich is basically to develop a plan B for the town.\n\n00:13:11.958 --> 00:13:14.958\nMost of our local authorities, when they sit down to plan\n\n00:13:14.958 --> 00:13:17.958\nfor the next five, 10, 15, 20 years of a community,\n\n00:13:17.958 --> 00:13:20.958\nstill start by assuming that there will be more energy,\n\n00:13:20.958 --> 00:13:22.958\nmore cars, more housing,\n\n00:13:22.958 --> 00:13:24.958\nmore jobs, more growth, and so on.\n\n00:13:24.958 --> 00:13:27.958\nWhat does it look like if that's not the case? And how can we embrace that\n\n00:13:27.958 --> 00:13:29.958\nand actually come up with something that was actually more likely\n\n00:13:29.958 --> 00:13:31.958\nto sustain everybody?\n\n00:13:31.958 --> 00:13:36.958\nAs a friend of mine says, \"Life is a series of things you're not quite ready for.\"\n\n00:13:36.958 --> 00:13:38.958\nAnd that's certainly been my experience with transition.\n\n00:13:38.958 --> 00:13:40.958\nFrom three years ago, it just being an idea,\n\n00:13:40.958 --> 00:13:44.958\nthis has become something that has virally swept around the world.\n\n00:13:44.958 --> 00:13:46.958\nWe're getting a lot of interest from government. Ed Miliband,\n\n00:13:46.958 --> 00:13:50.958\nthe energy minister of this country, was invited to come to our recent conference\n\n00:13:50.958 --> 00:13:52.958\nas a keynote listener.\n\n00:13:52.958 --> 00:13:54.958\nWhich he did --\n\n00:13:54.958 --> 00:13:55.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:13:55.958 --> 00:13:58.958\n(Applause) --\n\n00:13:58.958 --> 00:14:02.958\nand has since become a great advocate of the whole idea.\n\n00:14:02.958 --> 00:14:05.958\nThere are now two local authorities in this country\n\n00:14:05.958 --> 00:14:07.958\nwho have declared themselves transitional local authorities,\n\n00:14:07.958 --> 00:14:09.958\nLeicestershire and Somerset. And in Stroud,\n\n00:14:09.958 --> 00:14:14.958\nthe transition group there, in effect, wrote the local government's food plan.\n\n00:14:14.958 --> 00:14:16.958\nAnd the head of the council said,\n\n00:14:16.958 --> 00:14:18.958\n\"If we didn't have Transition Stroud, we would have to invent\n\n00:14:18.958 --> 00:14:22.958\nall of that community infrastructure for the first time.\"\n\n00:14:22.958 --> 00:14:25.958\nAs we see the spread of it, we see national hubs emerging.\n\n00:14:25.958 --> 00:14:28.958\nIn Scotland, the Scottish government's climate change fund\n\n00:14:28.958 --> 00:14:30.958\nhas funded Transition Scotland\n\n00:14:30.958 --> 00:14:33.958\nas a national organization supporting the spread of this.\n\n00:14:33.958 --> 00:14:36.958\nAnd we see it all over the place as well now.\n\n00:14:36.958 --> 00:14:39.958\nBut the key to transition is thinking not that we have to change everything now,\n\n00:14:39.958 --> 00:14:42.958\nbut that things are already inevitably changing,\n\n00:14:42.958 --> 00:14:45.958\nand what we need to do is to work creatively with that,\n\n00:14:45.958 --> 00:14:48.958\nbased on asking the right questions.\n\n00:14:48.958 --> 00:14:50.958\nI think I'd like to just return at the end\n\n00:14:50.958 --> 00:14:52.958\nto the idea of stories.\n\n00:14:52.958 --> 00:14:54.958\nBecause I think stories are vital here.\n\n00:14:54.958 --> 00:14:56.958\nAnd actually the stories that we tell ourselves,\n\n00:14:56.958 --> 00:15:01.958\nwe have a huge dearth of stories about how to move forward creatively from here.\n\n00:15:01.958 --> 00:15:03.958\nAnd one of the key things that transition does\n\n00:15:03.958 --> 00:15:05.958\nis to pull those stories out of what people are doing.\n\n00:15:05.958 --> 00:15:08.958\nStories about the community that's produced\n\n00:15:08.958 --> 00:15:11.958\nits own 21 pound note, for example,\n\n00:15:11.958 --> 00:15:14.958\nthe school that's turned its car park into a food garden,\n\n00:15:14.958 --> 00:15:17.958\nthe community that's founded its own energy company.\n\n00:15:17.958 --> 00:15:19.958\nAnd for me, one of the great stories recently\n\n00:15:19.958 --> 00:15:22.958\nwas the Obamas digging up the south lawn of the White House\n\n00:15:22.958 --> 00:15:24.958\nto create a vegetable garden. Because the last time that was done,\n\n00:15:24.958 --> 00:15:26.958\nwhen Eleanor Roosevelt did it,\n\n00:15:26.958 --> 00:15:31.958\nit led to the creation of 20 million vegetable gardens across the United States.\n\n00:15:31.958 --> 00:15:33.958\nSo the question I'd like to leave you with, really,\n\n00:15:33.958 --> 00:15:37.958\nis -- for all aspects of the things that your community needs\n\n00:15:37.958 --> 00:15:39.958\nin order to thrive,\n\n00:15:39.958 --> 00:15:41.958\nhow can it be done in such a way\n\n00:15:41.958 --> 00:15:44.958\nthat drastically reduces its carbon emissions,\n\n00:15:44.958 --> 00:15:46.958\nwhile also building resilience?\n\n00:15:46.958 --> 00:15:48.958\nPersonally, I feel enormously grateful\n\n00:15:48.958 --> 00:15:51.958\nto have lived through the age of cheap oil.\n\n00:15:51.958 --> 00:15:55.958\nI've been astonishingly lucky, we've been astonishingly lucky.\n\n00:15:55.958 --> 00:15:57.958\nBut let us honor what it has bought us,\n\n00:15:57.958 --> 00:15:59.958\nand move forward from this point.\n\n00:15:59.958 --> 00:16:01.958\nBecause if we cling to it, and continue to assume\n\n00:16:01.958 --> 00:16:04.958\nthat it can underpin our choices,\n\n00:16:04.958 --> 00:16:07.958\nthe future that it presents to us is one which is really unmanageable.\n\n00:16:07.958 --> 00:16:10.958\nAnd by loving and leaving all that oil has done for us,\n\n00:16:10.958 --> 00:16:12.958\nand that the Oil Age has done for us,\n\n00:16:12.958 --> 00:16:14.958\nwe are able to then begin the creation\n\n00:16:14.958 --> 00:16:17.958\nof a world which is more resilient,\n\n00:16:17.958 --> 00:16:19.958\nmore nourishing,\n\n00:16:19.958 --> 00:16:22.958\nand in which, we find ourselves fitter, more skilled\n\n00:16:22.958 --> 00:16:24.958\nand more connected to each other.\n\n00:16:24.958 --> 00:16:26.958\nThank you very much.\n\n00:16:26.958 --> 00:16:30.958\n(Applause)"}, {"title": "Turning dunes into architecture", "duration": "703", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/magnus_larsson_turning_dunes_into_architecture", "transcript": "It's a bit funny to be at a conference dedicated to things not seen, and present my proposal to build a 6,000-kilometer-long wall across the entire African continent. About the size of the Great Wall of China, this would hardly be an invisible structure. And yet it's made from parts that are invisible, or near-invisible, to the naked eye: bacteria and grains of sand.Now, as architects we're trained to solve problems. But I don't really believe in architectural problems; I only believe in opportunities. Which is why I'll show you a threat, and an architectural response. The threat is desertification. My response is a sandstone wall made from bacteria and solidified sand, stretching across the desert.Now, sand is a magical material of beautiful contradictions. It is simple and complex. It is peaceful and violent. It is always the same, never the same, endlessly fascinating. One billion grains of sand come into existence in the world each second. That's a cyclical process. As rocks and mountains die, grains of sand are born. Some of those grains may then cement naturally into sandstone. And as the sandstone weathers, new grains break free. Some of those grains may then accumulate on a massive scale, into a sand dune.In a way, the static, stone mountain becomes a moving mountain of sand. But, moving mountains can be dangerous. Let me try and explain why. Dry areas cover more than one third of the Earth's land surfaces. Some are already deserts; others are being seriously degraded by the sand. Just south of the Sahara we find the Sahel. The name means \"edge of the desert.\" And this is the region most closely associated with desertification. It was here in the late '60s and early '70s that major droughts brought three million people to become dependent upon emergency food aid, with about up to 250,000 dying.This is a catastrophe waiting to happen again. And it's one that gets very little attention. In our accelerated media culture, desertification is simply too slow to reach the headlines. It's nothing like a tsunami or a Katrina: too few crying children and smashed up houses. And yet desertification is a major threat on all continents, affecting some 110 countries and about 70 percent of the world's agricultural drylands.It seriously threatens the livelihoods of millions of people, and especially in Africa and China. And it is largely an issue that we've created for ourselves through unsustainable use of scarce resources. So, we get climate change. We get droughts, increased desertification, crashing food systems, water scarcity, famine, forced migration, political instability, warfare, crisis. That's a potential scenario if we fail to take this seriously. But, how far away is it?I went to Sokoto in northern Nigeria to try and find out how far away it is. The dunes here move southward at a pace of around 600 meters a year. That's the Sahara eating up almost [two meters] a day of the arable land, physically pushing people away from their homes. Here I am \u2014 I'm the second person on the left \u2014 (Laughter) with the elders in Gidan-Kara, a tiny village outside of Sokoto.They had to move this village in 1987 as a huge dune threatened to swallow it. So, they moved the entire village, hut by hut. This is where the village used to be. It took us about 10 minutes to climb up to the top of that dune, which goes to show why they had to move to a safer location. That's the kind of forced migration that desertification can lead to. If you happen to live close to the desert border, you can pretty much calculate how long it will be before you have to carry your kids away, and abandon your home and your life as you know it.Now, sand dunes cover only about one fifth of our deserts. And still, those extreme environments are very good places if we want to stop the shifting sands. Four years ago, 23 African countries came together to create the Great Green Wall Sahara. A fantastic project, the initial plan called for a shelter belt of trees to be planted right across the African continent, from Mauritania in the west, all the way to Djibouti in the east. If you want to stop a sand dune from moving, what you need to make sure to do is to stop the grains from avalanching over its crest. And a good way of doing that, the most efficient way, is to use some kind of sand catcher. Trees or cacti are good for this. But, one of the problems with planting trees is that the people in these regions are so poor that they chop them down for firewood.Now there is an alternative to just planting trees and hoping that they won't get chopped down. This sandstone wall that I'm proposing essentially does three things. It adds roughness to the dune's surface, to the texture of the dune's surface, binding the grains. It provides a physical support structure for the trees, and it creates physical spaces, habitable spaces inside of the sand dunes. If people live inside of the green barrier they can help support the trees, protect them from humans, and from some of the forces of nature. Inside of the dunes we find shade. We can start harvesting condensation, and start greening the desert from within.Sand dunes are almost like ready-made buildings in a way. All we need to do is solidify the parts that we need to be solid, and then excavate the sand, and we have our architecture. We can either excavate it by hand or we can have the wind excavate it for us. So, the wind carries the sand onto the site and then it carries the redundant sand away from the structure for us.But, by now, you're probably asking, how am I planning to solidify a sand dune? How do we glue those grains of sand together? And the answer is, perhaps, that you use these guys, Bacillus pasteurii, a micro-organism that is readily available in wetlands and marshes, and does precisely that. It takes a pile of loose sand and it creates sandstone out of it. These images from the American Society for Microbiology show us the process.What happens is, you pour Bacillus pasteurii onto a pile of sand, and it starts filling up the voids in between the grains. A chemical process produces calcite, which is a kind of natural cement that binds the grains together. The whole cementation process takes about 24 hours. I learned about this from a professor at U.C. Davis called Jason DeJong. He managed to do it in a mere 1,400 minutes. Here I am, playing the part of the mad scientist, working with the bugs at UCL in London, trying to solidify them.So, how much would this cost? I'm not an economist, very much not, but I did, quite literally, a back of the envelope calculation \u2014 (Laughter) \u2014 and it seems that for a cubic meter of concrete we would have to pay in the region of 90 dollars. And, after an initial cost of 60 bucks to buy the bacteria, which you'll never have to pay again, one cubic meter of bacterial sand would be about 11 dollars.How do we construct something like this? Well, I'll quickly show you two options. The first is to create a kind of balloon structure, fill it with bacteria, then allow the sand to wash over the balloon, pop the balloon, as it were, disseminating the bacteria into the sand and solidifying it. Then, a few years afterwards, using permacultural strategies, we green that part of the desert.The second alternative would be to use injection piles. So, we pushed the piles down through the dune, and we create an initial bacterial surface. We then pull the piles up through the dune and we're able to create almost any conceivable shape inside of the sand with the sand acting as a mold as we go up. So, we have a way of turning sand into sandstone, and then creating these habitable spaces inside of the desert dunes.But, what should they look like? Well, I was inspired, for my architectural form, by tafoni, which look a little bit like this, this is a model representation of it. These are cavernous rock structures that I found on the site in Sokoto. And I realized that if I scaled them up, they would provide me with good spatial qualities, for ventilation, for thermal comfort, and for other things. Now, part of the formal control over this structure would be lost to nature, obviously, as the bacteria do their work. And I think this creates a kind of boundless beauty actually. I think there is really something in that articulation that is quite nice. We see the result, the traces, if you like, of the Bacillus pasteurii being harnessed to sculpt the desert into these habitable environments.Some people believe that this would spread uncontrollably, and that the bacteria would kill everything in its way. That's not true at all. It's a natural process. It goes on in nature today, and the bacteria die as soon as we stop feeding them. So, there it is \u2014 architectural anti-desertification structures made from the desert itself. Sand-stopping devices, made from sand. The world is likely to lose one third of its arable land by the end of the century. In a period of unprecedented population growth and increased food demands, this could prove disastrous. And quite frankly, we're putting our heads in the sand.If nothing else, I would like for this scheme to initiate a discussion. But, if I had something like a TED wish, it would be to actually get it built, to start building this habitable wall, this very, very long, but very narrow city in the desert, built into the dunescape itself. It's not only something that supports trees, but something that connects people and countries together. I would like to conclude by showing you an animation of the structure, and leave you with a sentence by Jorge Luis Borges.Borges said that \"nothing is built on stone, everything is built on sand, but we must build as if the sand were stone.\"Now, there are many details left to explore in this scheme \u2014 political, practical, ethical, financial. My design, as it takes you down the rabbit hole, is fraught with many challenges and difficulties in the real world. But, it's a beginning, it's a vision. As Borges would have it, it's the sand. And I think now is really the time to turn it into stone. Thank you.

here in the late '60s and early '70s\n\n00:02:11.958 --> 00:02:14.958\nthat major droughts brought three million people\n\n00:02:14.958 --> 00:02:17.958\nto become dependent upon emergency food

countries\n\n00:02:47.958 --> 00:02:52.958\nand about 70 percent of the world's agricultural drylands.\n\n00:02:52.958 --> 00:02:56.958\nIt seriously threatens the livelihoods\n\n00:02:56.958 -->

this seriously.\n\n00:03:28.958 --> 00:03:30.958\nBut, how far away is it?\n\n00:03:30.958 --> 00:03:32.958\nI went to Sokoto in northern Nigeria\n\n00:03:32.958 --> 00:03:35.958\nto try and find out how far away it is.\n\n00:03:35.958 --> 00:03:40.958\nThe dunes here move southward at a pace of around 600 meters a year.\n\n00:03:40.958 --> 00:03:43.958\nThat's the Sahara eating up almost [two meters] a day of the arable land,\n\n00:03:43.958 --> 00:03:47.958\nphysically pushing people away from their homes.\n\n00:03:47.958 --> 00:03:50.958\nHere I am -- I'm the second person on the left

00:04:00.958\nThey had to move this village in 1987\n\n00:04:00.958 --> 00:04:03.958\nas a huge dune threatened to swallow it.\n\n00:04:03.958 --> 00:04:06.958\nSo, they moved the entire village, hut by hut.\n\n00:04:06.958 --> 00:04:08.958\nThis is where the village used to be.\n\n00:04:08.958 --> 00:04:13.958\nIt took us about 10 minutes to climb up to the top of that dune,\n\n00:04:13.958 --> 00:04:16.958\nwhich goes to show why they had to move to a safer location.\n\n00:04:16.958 --> 00:04:18.958\nThat's the kind of forced migration\n\n00:04:18.958 --> 00:04:21.958\nthat desertification can lead to.\n\n00:04:21.958 --> 00:04:23.958\nIf you happen to live close to the desert border,\n\n00:04:23.958 --> 00:04:25.958\nyou can pretty much calculate how long it will be\n\n00:04:25.958 --> 00:04:27.958\nbefore you have to carry your kids away,\n\n00:04:27.958 --> 00:04:32.958\nand abandon your home and your life as you know it.\n\n00:04:32.958 --> 00:04:36.958\nNow, sand dunes cover only about one fifth of our deserts.\n\n00:04:36.958 --> 00:04:39.958\nAnd still, those extreme environments are very good places\n\n00:04:39.958 --> 00:04:42.958\nif we want to stop the shifting

does precisely that.\n\n00:06:40.958 --> 00:06:42.958\nIt takes a pile of loose sand\n\n00:06:42.958 --> 00:06:45.958\nand it creates sandstone out of it.\n\n00:06:45.958 --> 00:06:49.958\nThese

00:07:10.958\nI learned about this from a professor at U.C. Davis called Jason DeJong.\n\n00:07:10.958 --> 00:07:14.958\nHe managed to do it in a mere 1,400 minutes.\n\n00:07:14.958 --> 00:07:16.958\nHere I am, playing the part of the mad scientist,\n\n00:07:16.958 --> 00:07:20.958\nworking with the bugs at UCL in London,\n\n00:07:20.958 --> 00:07:22.958\ntrying to solidify them.\n\n00:07:22.958 --> 00:07:25.958\nSo, how much would this cost?\n\n00:07:25.958 --> 00:07:27.958\nI'm not an economist, very much not,\n\n00:07:27.958 --> 00:07:31.958\nbut I did, quite literally, a back of the envelope calculation --\n\n00:07:31.958 --> 00:07:33.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:07:33.958 --> 00:07:36.958\n-- and it seems that for a cubic meter of concrete\n\n00:07:36.958 --> 00:07:39.958\nwe would have to pay in the region of 90 dollars.\n\n00:07:39.958 --> 00:07:42.958\nAnd, after an initial cost of 60 bucks to buy the bacteria,\n\n00:07:42.958 --> 00:07:44.958\nwhich you'll never have to pay again,\n\n00:07:44.958 --> 00:07:47.958\none cubic meter of bacterial sand\n\n00:07:47.958 --> 00:07:49.958\nwould be about 11 dollars.\n\n00:07:49.958 --> 00:07:51.958\nHow do we construct something like this?\n\n00:07:51.958 --> 00:07:53.958\nWell, I'll quickly show you two options.\n\n00:07:53.958 --> 00:07:55.958\nThe first is to create a kind of balloon structure,\n\n00:07:55.958 --> 00:07:59.958\nfill it with bacteria, then allow the sand to wash over the balloon,\n\n00:07:59.958 --> 00:08:03.958\npop the balloon, as it were, disseminating the bacteria into the sand and solidifying it.\n\n00:08:03.958 --> 00:08:05.958\nThen, a few years afterwards,\n\n00:08:05.958 --> 00:08:07.958\nusing permacultural strategies,\n\n00:08:07.958 --> 00:08:10.958\nwe green that part of the desert.\n\n00:08:10.958 --> 00:08:13.958\nThe second alternative would be to use injection piles.\n\n00:08:13.958 --> 00:08:15.958\nSo, we pushed the piles down through the dune,\n\n00:08:15.958 --> 00:08:18.958\nand we create an initial bacterial surface.\n\n00:08:18.958 --> 00:08:21.958\nWe then pull the piles up through the dune\n\n00:08:21.958 --> 00:08:24.958\nand we're able to create almost any conceivable shape inside of the sand\n\n00:08:24.958 --> 00:08:28.958\nwith the sand acting as a mold as we go up.\n\n00:08:28.958 --> 00:08:32.958\nSo, we have a way of turning sand into sandstone,\n\n00:08:32.958 --> 00:08:36.958\nand then creating these habitable spaces inside of the desert dunes.\n\n00:08:36.958 --> 00:08:38.958\nBut, what should they look like?\n\n00:08:38.958 --> 00:08:43.958\nWell, I was inspired, for my architectural form, by tafoni,\n\n00:08:43.958 --> 00:08:46.958\nwhich look a little bit like this, this is a model representation of it.\n\n00:08:46.958 --> 00:08:49.958\nThese are cavernous rock structures that I found on the site in Sokoto.\n\n00:08:49.958 --> 00:08:52.958\nAnd I realized that if I scaled them up, they would provide me\n\n00:08:52.958 --> 00:08:55.958\nwith good spatial qualities,\n\n00:08:55.958 --> 00:08:58.958\nfor ventilation, for thermal comfort, and for other things.\n\n00:08:58.958 --> 00:09:01.958\nNow, part of the formal control over this structure\n\n00:09:01.958 --> 00:09:03.958\nwould be lost to nature, obviously,\n\n00:09:03.958 --> 00:09:06.958\nas the bacteria do their work.\n\n00:09:06.958 --> 00:09:09.958\nAnd I think this creates a kind of boundless beauty actually.\n\n00:09:09.958 --> 00:09:12.958\nI think there is really something in that articulation\n\n00:09:12.958 --> 00:09:14.958\nthat is quite nice.\n\n00:09:14.958 --> 00:09:18.958\nWe see the result, the traces, if you like,\n\n00:09:18.958 --> 00:09:21.958\nof the Bacillus pasteurii being harnessed to sculpt the desert\n\n00:09:21.958 --> 00:09:23.958\ninto these habitable environments.\n\n00:09:23.958 --> 00:09:26.958\nSome people believe that\n\n00:09:26.958 --> 00:09:28.958\nthis would spread uncontrollably,\n\n00:09:28.958 --> 00:09:30.958\nand that the bacteria would kill everything in its way.\n\n00:09:30.958 --> 00:09:32.958\nThat's not true at all.\n\n00:09:32.958 --> 00:09:34.958\nIt's a natural process. It goes on in nature today,\n\n00:09:34.958 --> 00:09:37.958\nand the bacteria die as soon as we stop feeding them.\n\n00:09:37.958 --> 00:09:39.958\nSo, there it is --\n\n00:09:39.958 --> 00:09:42.958\narchitectural anti-desertification structures\n\n00:09:42.958 --> 00:09:44.958\nmade from the desert itself.\n\n00:09:44.958 --> 00:09:48.958\nSand-stopping devices, made from sand.\n\n00:09:48.958 --> 00:09:51.958\nThe world is likely to lose one third of its arable land\n\n00:09:51.958 --> 00:09:53.958\nby the end of the century.\n\n00:09:53.958 --> 00:09:57.958\nIn a period of unprecedented population growth\n\n00:09:57.958 --> 00:09:59.958\nand increased food demands, this could prove disastrous.\n\n00:09:59.958 --> 00:10:03.958\nAnd quite frankly, we're putting our heads in the sand.\n\n00:10:03.958 --> 00:10:08.958\nIf nothing else, I would like for this scheme to initiate a discussion.\n\n00:10:08.958 --> 00:10:10.958\nBut, if I had something like a TED wish,\n\n00:10:10.958 --> 00:10:12.958\nit would be to actually get it built,\n\n00:10:12.958 --> 00:10:15.958\nto start building this habitable wall,\n\n00:10:15.958 --> 00:10:19.958\nthis very, very long, but very narrow city in the desert,\n\n00:10:19.958 --> 00:10:23.958\nbuilt into the dunescape itself.\n\n00:10:23.958 --> 00:10:26.958\nIt's not only something that supports trees,\n\n00:10:26.958 --> 00:10:30.958\nbut something that connects people and countries together.\n\n00:10:30.958 --> 00:10:36.958\nI would like to conclude by showing you an animation of the structure,\n\n00:10:36.958 --> 00:10:42.958\nand leave you with a sentence by Jorge Luis Borges.\n\n00:10:42.958 --> 00:10:48.958\nBorges said that \"nothing is built on stone,\n\n00:10:48.958 --> 00:10:52.958\neverything is built on sand,\n\n00:10:52.958 --> 00:10:57.958\nbut we must build as if the sand were stone.\"\n\n00:10:57.958 --> 00:11:01.958\nNow, there are many details left to explore in this scheme --\n\n00:11:01.958 --> 00:11:06.958\npolitical, practical, ethical, financial.\n\n00:11:06.958 --> 00:11:11.958\nMy design, as it takes you down the rabbit hole,\n\n00:11:11.958 --> 00:11:15.958\nis fraught with many challenges\n\n00:11:15.958 --> 00:11:18.958\nand difficulties in the real world.\n\n00:11:18.958 --> 00:11:22.958\nBut, it's a beginning, it's a vision.\n\n00:11:22.958 --> 00:11:26.958\nAs Borges would have it, it's the sand.\n\n00:11:26.958 --> 00:11:29.958\nAnd I think now is really the time\n\n00:11:29.958 --> 00:11:32.958\nto turn it into stone. Thank you.\n\n00:11:32.958 --> 00:11:34.958\n(Applause)"}, {"title": "Dance to change the world", "duration": "1012", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/mallika_sarabhai", "transcript": "One day a one-eyed monkey came into the forest. Under a tree she saw a woman meditating furiously. The one-eyed monkey recognized the woman, a Sekhri. She was the wife of an even more famous Brahmin. To watch her better, the one-eyed monkey climbed onto the tree. Just then, with a loud bang, the heavens opened. (Claps) And the god Indra jumped into the clearing. Indra saw the woman, a Sekhri. Ah-hah. The woman paid him no heed. So, Indra, attracted, threw her onto the floor, and proceeded to rape her. Then Indra disappeared. (Clap! Clap!) And the woman's husband, the Brahmin, appeared. He realized at once what had happened. So, he petitioned the higher gods so that he may have justice. So, the god Vishnu arrived.\"Are there any witnesses?\"\"Just a one-eyed monkey,\" said the Brahmin.Now, the one-eyed monkey really wanted for the woman, a Sekhri, to get justice, so she retold events exactly as they had happened. Vishnu gave his judgment.\"The god Indra has sinned, in that he has sinned against ... a Brahmin. May he be called to wash away his sins.\"So, Indra arrived, and performed the sacrifice of the horse. And so it transpired that a horse was killed, a god was made sin-free, a Brahmin's ego was appeased, a woman ... was ruined, and a one-eyed monkey was left ... very confused at what we humans call justice.In India there is a rape every three minutes. In India, only 25 percent of rapes come to a police station, and of these 25 percent that come to a police station, convictions are only in four percent of the cases. That's a lot of women who don't get justice.And it's not only about women. Look around you, look at your own countries. There is a certain pattern in who gets charged with crimes. If you're in Australia, it's mostly aboriginals who are in jail. If you're in India, it's either Muslims or Adivasis, our tribals, the Naxalites. If you're in the U.S., it's mostly the blacks. There is a trend here. And the Brahmins and the gods, like in my story, always get to tell their truth as The Truth. So, have we all become one-eyed \u2014 two-eyed instead of one-eyed \u2014 monkeys? Have we stopped seeing injustice?Good morning. (Applause) You know, I have told this story close to 550 times, in audiences in 40 countries, to school students, to black-tie dinners at the Smithsonian, and so on and so forth, and every time it hits something. Now, if I were to go into the same crowd and say, \"I want to lecture you about justice and injustice,\" they would say, \"Thank you very much, we have other things to do.\" And that is the astonishing power of art.Art can go through where other things can't. You can't have barriers, because it breaks through your prejudices, breaks through everything that you have as your mask, that says, \"I am this, I am that, I am that.\" No. It breaks through those. And it reaches somewhere where other things don't. And in a world where attitudes are so difficult to change, we need a language that reaches through.Hitler knew it; he used Wagner to make all the Nazis feel wonderful and Aryan. And Mr. Berlusconi knows it, as he sits atop this huge empire of media and television and so on and so forth. And all of the wonderful creative minds who are in all the advertising agencies, and who help corporate sell us things we absolutely don't require, they also know the power of the arts.For me it came very early. When I was a young child, my mother, who was a choreographer, came upon a phenomenon that worried her. It was a phenomenon where young brides were committing suicide in rural Gujarat, because they were being forced to bring more and more money for their in-laws' families. And she created a dance piece which then Prime Minister Nehru saw. He came to talk to her and said, \"What is this about?\" She told him and he set out the first inquiry into what today we call Dowry Dance. Imagine a dance piece for the first inquiry into something that even today kills thousands of women.Many years later, when I was working with the director Peter Brook in \"The Mahabharata\" playing this feisty feminine feminist called Draupadi, I had similar experiences. Big fat black mamas in the Bronx used to come and say, \"Hey girl, that's it!\" And then these trendy young things in the Sorbonne would say, \"Madame Draupadi, on n'est pas feministe, mais \u00e7a? \u00c7a!\" And then aboriginal women in Africa would come and say, \"This is it!\" And I thought, \"This is what we need, as a language.\"We had somebody from public health. And Devdutt also mentioned public health. Well, millions of people around the world die of waterborne disease every year. And that's because there is no clean water to drink, or in countries like India, people don't know that they need to soap their hands before defecation. So, what do they do? They drink the water they know is dirty, they get cholera, they get diarrhea, they get jaundice and they die. And governments have not been able to provide clean water. They try and build it. They try and build pipelines; it doesn't happen. And the MNCs give them machines that they cannot afford. So what do you do? Do you let them die?Well, somebody had a great idea. And it was a simple idea. It was an idea that could not profit anybody but would help health in every field. Most houses in Asia and India have a cotton garment. And it was discovered, and WHO endorses this, that a clean cotton garment folded eight times over, can reduce bacteria up to 80 percent from water sieved through. So, why aren't governments blaring this on television? Why isn't it on every poster across the third world? Because there is no profit in it. Because nobody can get a kickback. But it still needs to get to people. And here is one of the ways we get it to people.[Video] Woman: Then get me one of those fancy water purifiers.Man: You know how expensive those are. I have a solution that requires neither machine, nor wood, nor cooking gas.Woman: What solution?Man: Listen, go fetch that cotton sari you have.Boy: Grand-dad, tell me the solution please.Man: I will tell all of you. Just wait.Woman: Here father. (Man: Is it clean?) Woman: Yes, of course.Man: Then do as I tell you. Fold the sari into eight folds.Woman: All right, father.Man: And you, you count that she does it right. (Boy: All right, grand-dad.)Man: One, two, three, four folds we make. All the germs from the water we take.Chorus: One, two, three, four folds we make. All the germs from the water we take. Five, six, seven, eight folds we make. Our drinking water safe we make. Five, six, seven, eight folds we make. Our drinking water safe we make.Woman: Here, father, your eight-times folded cotton sari.Man: So this is the cotton sari. And through this we will have clean water.(Applause)I think it's safe to say that all of us here are deeply concerned about the escalating violence in our daily lives. While universities are trying to devise courses in conflict resolution, and governments are trying to stop skirmishes at borders, we are surrounded by violence, whether it's road rage, or whether it's domestic violence, whether it's a teacher beating up a student and killing her because she hasn't done her homework, it's everywhere. So, why are we not doing something to actually attend that problem on a day to day basis?What are we doing to try and make children and young people realize that violence is something that we indulge in, that we can stop, and that there are other ways of actually taking violence, taking anger, taking frustrations into different things that do not harm other people. Well, here is one such way.(Video) (Laughs) You are peaceful people. Your parents were peaceful people. Your grandparents were peaceful people. So much peace in one place? How could it be otherwise?(Music)But, what if ... Yes. What if ... One little gene in you has been trying to get through? From your beginnings in Africa, through each generation, may be passed on to you, in your creation. It's a secret urge, hiding deep in you. And if it's in you, then it's in me too. Oh, dear.It's what made you smack your baby brother, stamp on a cockroach, scratch your mother. It's the feeling that wells up from deep inside, when your husband comes home drunk and you wanna tan his hide. Want to kill that cyclist on the way to work, and string up your cousin 'cause she's such a jerk. Oh, dear. And as for outsiders, white, black or brown, tar and feather them, and whip them out of town.It's that little gene. It's small and it's mean. Too small for detection, it's your built-in protection. Adrenaline, kill. It'll give you the will. Yes, you'd better face it 'cause you can't displace it. You're V-I-O-L-E-N-T. Cause you're either a victim, or on top, like me.Goodbye, Abraham Lincoln. Goodbye, Mahatma Gandhi. Goodbye, Martin Luther King. Hello, gangs from this neighborhood killing gangs from that neighborhood. Hello governments of rich countries selling arms to governments of poor countries who can't even afford to give them food. Hello civilization. Hello, 21st century. Look what we've ... look what they've done. (Applause)Mainstream art, cinema, has been used across the world to talk about social issues. A few years ago we had a film called Rang De Basanti, which suddenly spawned thousands of young people wanting to volunteer for social change. In Venezuela, one of the most popular soap operas has a heroine called Crystal. And when, onscreen, Crystal got breast cancer, 75,000 more young women went to have mammographies done. And of course, \"The Vagina Monologues\" we know about. And there are stand-up comics who are talking about racial issues, about ethnic issues.So, why is it, that if we think that we all agree that we need a better world, we need a more just world, why is it that we are not using the one language that has consistently showed us that we can break down barriers, that we can reach people? What I need to say to the planners of the world, the governments, the strategists is, \"You have treated the arts as the cherry on the cake. It needs to be the yeast.\" Because, any future planning, if 2048 is when we want to get there, unless the arts are put with the scientists, with the economists, with all those who prepare for the future, badly, we're not going to get there. And unless this is actually internalized, it won't happen.So, what is it that we require? What is it that we need? We need to break down our vision of what planners are, of what the correct way of a path is. And to say all these years of trying to make a better world, and we have failed. There are more people being raped. There are more wars. There are more people dying of simple things. So, something has got to give. And that is what I want. Can I have my last audio track please?Once there was a princess who whistled beautifully. (Whistling) Her father the king said, \"Don't whistle.\" Her mother the queen said, \"Hai, don't whistle.\" But the princess continued whistling. (Whistling)The years went by and the princess grew up into a beautiful young woman, who whistled even more beautifully. (Whistling) Her father the king said, \"Who will marry a whistling princess?\" Her mother the queen said, \"Who will marry a whistling princess?\"But the king had an idea. He announced a Swayamvara. He invited all the princes to come and defeat his daughter at whistling. \"Whoever defeats my daughter shall have half my kingdom and her hand in marriage!\" Soon the palace filled with princes whistling. (Whistling) Some whistled badly. Some whistled well. But nobody could defeat the princess.\"Now what shall we do?\" said the king. \"Now what shall we do?\" said the queen. But the princess said, \"Father, Mother, don't worry. I have an idea. I am going to go to each of these young men and I am going to ask them if they defeated correctly. And if somebody answers, that shall be my wish.\"So she went up to each and said, \"Do you accept that I have defeated you?\" And they said, \"Me? Defeated by a woman? No way, that's impossible! No no no no no! That's not possible.\" Till finally one prince said, \"Princess, I accept, you have defeated me.\" \"Uh-huh ...\" she said. \"Father, mother, this man shall be my wife.\" (Whistling)Thank you.

I am going to go to each of these young men\n\n00:15:49.958 --> 00:15:51.958\nand I am going to ask them\n\n00:15:51.958 --> 00:15:53.958\nif they defeated correctly.\n\n00:15:53.958 --> 00:15:56.958\nAnd if somebody answers, that shall be my wish.\"\n\n00:15:56.958 --> 00:16:00.958\nSo she went up to each and said, \"Do you accept that I have defeated you?\"\n\n00:16:00.958 --> 00:16:02.958\nAnd they said, \"Me?

That's not possible.\"\n\n00:16:06.958 --> 00:16:08.958\nTill finally one prince said,\n\n00:16:08.958 --> 00:16:12.958\n\"Princess, I accept, you have defeated me.\"\n\n00:16:14.958 --> 00:16:16.958\n\"Uh-huh ...\" she said.\n\n00:16:16.958 --> 00:16:20.958\n\"Father, mother, this man shall be my wife.\"\n\n00:16:20.958 --> 00:16:25.958\n(Whistling)\n\n00:16:25.958 --> 00:16:27.958\nThank you.\n\n00:16:27.958 --> 00:16:42.958\n(Applause)"}, {"title": "Why nations should pursue soft power", "duration": "1073", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/shashi_tharoor", "transcript": "As an Indian, and now as a politician and a government minister, I've become rather concerned about the hype we're hearing about our own country, all this talk about India becoming a world leader, even the next superpower. In fact, the American publishers of my book, \"The Elephant, The Tiger and the Cell Phone,\" added a gratuitous subtitle saying, \"India: The next 21st-century power.\" And I just don't think that's what India's all about, or should be all about.Indeed, what worries me is the entire notion of world leadership seems to me terribly archaic. It's redolent of James Bond movies and Kipling ballads. After all, what constitutes a world leader? If it's population, we're on course to top the charts. We will overtake China by 2034. Is it military strength? Well, we have the world's fourth largest army. Is it nuclear capacity? We know we have that. The Americans have even recognized it, in an agreement. Is it the economy? Well, we have now the fifth-largest economy in the world in purchasing power parity terms. And we continue to grow. When the rest of the world took a beating last year, we grew at 6.7 percent.But, somehow, none of that adds up to me, to what I think India really can aim to contribute in the world, in this part of the 21st century. And so I wondered, could what the future beckons for India to be all about be a combination of these things allied to something else, the power of example, the attraction of India's culture, what, in other words, people like to call \"soft power.\"Soft power is a concept invented by a Harvard academic, Joseph Nye, a friend of mine. And, very simply, and I'm really cutting it short because of the time limits here, it's essentially the ability of a country to attract others because of its culture, its political values, its foreign policies. And, you know, lots of countries do this. He was writing initially about the States, but we know the Alliance Francaise is all about French soft power, the British Council. The Beijing Olympics were an exercise in Chinese soft power. Americans have the Voice of America and the Fulbright scholarships. But, the fact is, in fact, that probably Hollywood and MTV and McDonalds have done more for American soft power around the world than any specifically government activity.So soft power is something that really emerges partly because of governments, but partly despite governments. And in the information era we all live in today, what we might call the TED age, I'd say that countries are increasingly being judged by a global public that's been fed on an incessant diet of Internet news, of televised images, of cellphone videos, of email gossip. In other words, all sorts of communication devices are telling us the stories of countries, whether or not the countries concerned want people to hear those stories.Now, in this age, again, countries with access to multiple channels of communication and information have a particular advantage. And of course they have more influence, sometimes, about how they're seen. India has more all-news TV channels than any country in the world, in fact in most of the countries in this part of the world put together.But, the fact still is that it's not just that. In order to have soft power, you have to be connected. One might argue that India has become an astonishingly connected country. I think you've already heard the figures. We've been selling 15 million cellphones a month. Currently there are 509 million cellphones in Indian hands, in India. And that makes us larger than the U.S. as a telephone market. In fact, those 15 million cellphones are the most connections that any country, including the U.S. and China, has ever established in the history of telecommunications.But, what perhaps some of you don't realize is how far we've come to get there. You know, when I grew up in India, telephones were a rarity. In fact, they were so rare that elected members of Parliament had the right to allocate 15 telephone lines as a favor to those they deemed worthy. If you were lucky enough to be a wealthy businessman or an influential journalist, or a doctor or something, you might have a telephone. But sometimes it just sat there.I went to high school in Calcutta. And we would look at this instrument sitting in the front foyer. But half the time we would pick it up with an expectant look on our faces, there would be no dial tone. If there was a dial tone and you dialed a number, the odds were two in three you wouldn't get the number you were intending to reach. In fact the words \"wrong number\" were more popular than the word \"Hello.\" (Laughter) If you then wanted to connect to another city, let's say from Calcutta you wanted to call Delhi, you'd have to book something called a trunk call, and then sit by the phone all day, waiting for it to come through. Or you could pay eight times the going rate for something called a lightning call. But, lightning struck rather slowly in our country in those days, so, it was like about a half an hour for a lightning call to come through.In fact, so woeful was our telephone service that a Member of Parliament stood up in 1984 and complained about this. And the Then-Communications Minister replied in a lordly manner that in a developing country communications are a luxury, not a right, that the government had no obligation to provide better service, and if the honorable Member wasn't satisfied with his telephone, could he please return it, since there was an eight-year-long waiting list for telephones in India.Now, fast-forward to today and this is what you see: the 15 million cell phones a month. But what is most striking is who is carrying those cell phones. You know, if you visit friends in the suburbs of Delhi, on the side streets you will find a fellow with a cart that looks like it was designed in the 16th century, wielding a coal-fired steam iron that might have been invented in the 18th century. He's called an isthri wala. But he's carrying a 21st-century instrument. He's carrying a cell phone because most incoming calls are free, and that's how he gets orders from the neighborhood, to know where to collect clothes to get them ironed.The other day I was in Kerala, my home state, at the country farm of a friend, about 20 kilometers away from any place you'd consider urban. And it was a hot day and he said, \"Hey, would you like some fresh coconut water?\" And it's the best thing and the most nutritious and refreshing thing you can drink on a hot day in the tropics, so I said sure. And he whipped out his cellphone, dialed the number, and a voice said, \"I'm up here.\" And right on top of the nearest coconut tree, with a hatchet in one hand and a cell phone in the other, was a local toddy tapper, who proceeded to bring down the coconuts for us to drink.Fishermen are going out to sea and carrying their cell phones. When they catch the fish they call all the market towns along the coast to find out where they get the best possible prices. Farmers now, who used to have to spend half a day of backbreaking labor to find out if the market town was open, if the market was on, whether the product they'd harvested could be sold, what price they'd fetch. They'd often send an eight year old boy all the way on this trudge to the market town to get that information and come back, then they'd load the cart. Today they're saving half a day's labor with a two minute phone call.So this empowerment of the underclass is the real result of India being connected. And that transformation is part of where India is heading today. But, of course that's not the only thing about India that's spreading. You've got Bollywood. My attitude to Bollywood is best summarized in the tale of the two goats at a Bollywood garbage dump \u2014 Mr. Shekhar Kapur, forgive me \u2014 and they're chewing away on cans of celluloid discarded by a Bollywood studio. And the first goat, chewing away, says, \"You know, this film is not bad.\" And the second goat says, \"No, the book was better.\" (Laughter)I usually tend to think that the book is usually better, but, having said that, the fact is that Bollywood is now taking a certain aspect of Indian-ness and Indian culture around the globe, not just in the Indian diaspora in the U.S. and the U.K., but to the screens of Arabs and Africans, of Senegalese and Syrians. I've met a young man in New York whose illiterate mother in a village in Senegal takes a bus once a month to the capital city of Dakar, just to watch a Bollywood movie. She can't understand the dialogue. She's illiterate, so she can't read the French subtitles. But these movies are made to be understood despite such handicaps, and she has a great time in the song and the dance and the action. She goes away with stars in her eyes about India, as a result.And this is happening more and more. Afghanistan, we know what a serious security problem Afghanistan is for so many of us in the world. India doesn't have a military mission there. You know what was India's biggest asset in Afghanistan in the last seven years? One simple fact: you couldn't try to call an Afghan at 8:30 in the evening. Why? Because that was the moment when the Indian television soap opera, \"Kyunki Saas Bhi Kabhi Bahu Thi,\" dubbed into Dari, was telecast on Tolo T.V. And it was the most popular television show in Afghan history. Every Afghan family wanted to watch it. They had to suspend functions at 8:30. Weddings were reported to be interrupted so guests could cluster around the T.V. set, and then turn their attention back to the bride and groom. Crime went up at 8:30. I have read a Reuters dispatch \u2014 so this is not Indian propaganda, a British news agency \u2014 about how robbers in the town of Musarri Sharif* stripped a vehicle of its windshield wipers, its hubcaps, its sideview mirrors, any moving part they could find, at 8:30, because the watchmen were busy watching the T.V. rather than minding the store. And they scrawled on the windshield in a reference to the show's heroine, \"Tulsi Zindabad\": \"Long live Tulsi.\" (Laughter)That's soft power. And that is what India is developing through the \"E\" part of TED: its own entertainment industry. The same is true, of course \u2014 we don't have time for too many more examples \u2014 but it's true of our music, of our dance, of our art, yoga, ayurveda, even Indian cuisine. I mean, the proliferation of Indian restaurants since I first went abroad as a student, in the mid '70s, and what I see today, you can't go to a mid-size town in Europe or North America and not find an Indian restaurant. It may not be a very good one. But, today in Britain, for example, Indian restaurants in Britain employ more people than the coal mining, ship building and iron and steel industries combined. So the empire can strike back. (Applause)But, with this increasing awareness of India, with you and with I, and so on, with tales like Afghanistan, comes something vital in the information era, the sense that in today's world it's not the side of the bigger army that wins, it's the country that tells a better story that prevails. And India is, and must remain, in my view, the land of the better story. Stereotypes are changing. I mean, again, having gone to the U.S. as a student in the mid '70s, I knew what the image of India was then, if there was an image at all.Today, people in Silicon Valley and elsewhere speak of the IITs, the Indian Institutes of Technology with the same reverence they used to accord to MIT. This can sometimes have unintended consequences. OK. I had a friend, a history major like me, who was accosted at Schiphol Airport in Amsterdam, by an anxiously perspiring European saying, \"You're Indian, you're Indian! Can you help me fix my laptop?\" (Laughter)We've gone from the image of India as land of fakirs lying on beds of nails, and snake charmers with the Indian rope trick, to the image of India as a land of mathematical geniuses, computer wizards, software gurus. But that too is transforming the Indian story around the world. But, there is something more substantive to that. The story rests on a fundamental platform of political pluralism. It's a civilizational story to begin with. Because India has been an open society for millennia. India gave refuge to the Jews, fleeing the destruction of the first temple by the Babylonians, and said thereafter by the Romans.In fact, legend has is that when Doubting Thomas, the Apostle, Saint Thomas, landed on the shores of Kerala, my home state, somewhere around 52 A.D., he was welcomed on shore by a flute-playing Jewish girl. And to this day remains the only Jewish diaspora in the history of the Jewish people, which has never encountered a single incident of anti-semitism. (Applause) That's the Indian story. Islam came peacefully to the south, slightly more differently complicated history in the north. But all of these religions have found a place and a welcome home in India.You know, we just celebrated, this year, our general elections, the biggest exercise in democratic franchise in human history. And the next one will be even bigger, because our voting population keeps growing by 20 million a year. But, the fact is that the last elections, five years ago, gave the world extraordinary phenomenon of an election being won by a woman political leader of Italian origin and Roman Catholic faith, Sonia Gandhi, who then made way for a Sikh, Mohan Singh, to be sworn in as Prime Minister by a Muslim, President Abdul Kalam, in a country 81 percent Hindu. (Applause)This is India, and of course it's all the more striking because it was four years later that we all applauded the U.S., the oldest democracy in the modern world, more than 220 years of free and fair elections, which took till last year to elect a president or a vice president who wasn't white, male or Christian. So, maybe \u2014 oh sorry, he is Christian, I beg your pardon \u2014 and he is male, but he isn't white. All the others have been all those three. (Laughter) All his predecessors have been all those three, and that's the point I was trying to make. (Laughter)But, the issue is that when I talked about that example, it's not just about talking about India, it's not propaganda. Because ultimately, that electoral outcome had nothing to do with the rest of the world. It was essentially India being itself. And ultimately, it seems to me, that always works better than propaganda. Governments aren't very good at telling stories. But people see a society for what it is, and that, it seems to me, is what ultimately will make a difference in today's information era, in today's TED age.So India now is no longer the nationalism of ethnicity or language or religion, because we have every ethnicity known to mankind, practically, we've every religion know to mankind, with the possible exception of Shintoism, though that has some Hindu elements somewhere. We have 23 official languages that are recognized in our Constitution. And those of you who cashed your money here might be surprised to see how many scripts there are on the rupee note, spelling out the denominations. We've got all of that. We don't even have geography uniting us, because the natural geography of the subcontinent framed by the mountains and the sea was hacked by the partition with Pakistan in 1947. In fact, you can't even take the name of the country for granted, because the name \"India\" comes from the river Indus, which flows in Pakistan.But, the whole point is that India is the nationalism of an idea. It's the idea of an ever-ever-land, emerging from an ancient civilization, united by a shared history, but sustained, above all, by pluralist democracy. That is a 21st-century story as well as an ancient one. And it's the nationalism of an idea that essentially says you can endure differences of caste, creed, color, culture, cuisine, custom and costume, consonant, for that matter, and still rally around a consensus. And the consensus is of a very simple principle, that in a diverse plural democracy like India you don't really have to agree on everything all the time, so long as you agree on the ground rules of how you will disagree. The great success story of India, a country that so many learned scholars and journalists assumed would disintegrate, in the '50s and '60s, is that it managed to maintain consensus on how to survive without consensus.Now, that is the India that is emerging into the 21st century. And I do want to make the point that if there is anything worth celebrating about India, it isn't military muscle, economic power. All of that is necessary, but we still have huge amounts of problems to overcome. Somebody said we are super poor, and we are also super power. We can't really be both of those. We have to overcome our poverty. We have to deal with the hardware of development, the ports, the roads, the airports, all the infrastructural things we need to do, and the software of development, the human capital, the need for the ordinary person in India to be able to have a couple of square meals a day, to be able to send his or her children to a decent school, and to aspire to work a job that will give them opportunities in their lives that can transform themselves.But, it's all taking place, this great adventure of conquering those challenges, those real challenges which none of us can pretend don't exist. But, it's all taking place in an open society, in a rich and diverse and plural civilization, in one that is determined to liberate and fulfill the creative energies of its people. That's why India belongs at TED, and that's why TED belongs in India. Thank you very much.

Well, we have the world's fourth largest army.\n\n00:00:57.958 --> 00:00:59.958\nIs it nuclear capacity? We know we have that.\n\n00:00:59.958 --> 00:01:01.958\nThe Americans have even recognized it,\n\n00:01:01.958 --> 00:01:03.958\nin an agreement.\n\n00:01:03.958 --> 00:01:05.958\nIs it the economy? Well, we have now\n\n00:01:05.958 --> 00:01:07.958\nthe fifth-largest economy in the world\n\n00:01:07.958 --> 00:01:09.958\nin purchasing power parity terms.\n\n00:01:09.958 --> 00:01:12.958\nAnd we continue to grow. When the rest of the world took a beating last year,\n\n00:01:12.958 --> 00:01:15.958\nwe grew at 6.7 percent.\n\n00:01:15.958 --> 00:01:19.958\nBut, somehow, none of that adds up to me,\n\n00:01:19.958 --> 00:01:24.958\nto what I think India really can aim to contribute in the world,\n\n00:01:24.958 --> 00:01:26.958\nin this part of the 21st century.\n\n00:01:26.958 --> 00:01:29.958\nAnd so I wondered, could\n\n00:01:29.958 --> 00:01:32.958\nwhat the future beckons for India to be all about\n\n00:01:32.958 --> 00:01:35.958\nbe a combination of these things allied to something else,\n\n00:01:35.958 --> 00:01:37.958\nthe power of example,\n\n00:01:37.958 --> 00:01:40.958\nthe attraction of India's culture,\n\n00:01:40.958 --> 00:01:45.958\nwhat, in other words, people like to call \"soft power.\"\n\n00:01:45.958 --> 00:01:48.958\nSoft power is a concept invented by a Harvard academic,\n\n00:01:48.958 --> 00:01:50.958\nJoseph Nye, a friend of mine.\n\n00:01:50.958 --> 00:01:54.958\nAnd, very simply, and I'm really cutting it short because of the time limits here,\n\n00:01:54.958 --> 00:01:57.958\nit's essentially the ability of a country to attract others\n\n00:01:57.958 --> 00:01:59.958\nbecause of its culture, its political values,\n\n00:01:59.958 --> 00:02:01.958\nits foreign policies.\n\n00:02:01.958 --> 00:02:04.958\nAnd, you know, lots of countries do this. He was writing initially about the States,\n\n00:02:04.958 --> 00:02:06.958\nbut we know the Alliance Francaise\n\n00:02:06.958 --> 00:02:09.958\nis all about French soft power, the British Council.\n\n00:02:09.958 --> 00:02:12.958\nThe Beijing Olympics were an exercise in Chinese soft power.\n\n00:02:12.958 --> 00:02:16.958\nAmericans have the Voice of America and the Fulbright scholarships.\n\n00:02:16.958 --> 00:02:18.958\nBut, the fact is, in fact,\n\n00:02:18.958 --> 00:02:21.958\nthat probably Hollywood and MTV and McDonalds\n\n00:02:21.958 --> 00:02:23.958\nhave done more for American soft power\n\n00:02:23.958 --> 00:02:26.958\naround the world than any specifically government activity.\n\n00:02:26.958 --> 00:02:29.958\nSo soft power is something that really emerges\n\n00:02:29.958 --> 00:02:31.958\npartly because of governments,\n\n00:02:31.958 --> 00:02:33.958\nbut partly despite governments.\n\n00:02:33.958 --> 00:02:36.958\nAnd in the information era we all live in today,\n\n00:02:36.958 --> 00:02:39.958\nwhat we might call the TED age,\n\n00:02:39.958 --> 00:02:42.958\nI'd say that countries are increasingly being judged\n\n00:02:42.958 --> 00:02:45.958\nby a global public that's been fed\n\n00:02:45.958 --> 00:02:48.958\non an incessant diet of Internet news,\n\n00:02:48.958 --> 00:02:50.958\nof televised images,\n\n00:02:50.958 --> 00:02:53.958\nof cellphone videos, of email gossip.\n\n00:02:53.958 --> 00:02:56.958\nIn other words, all sorts of communication devices\n\n00:02:56.958 --> 00:02:58.958\nare telling us the stories of countries,\n\n00:02:58.958 --> 00:03:03.958\nwhether or not the countries concerned want people to hear those stories.\n\n00:03:03.958 --> 00:03:05.958\nNow, in this age, again, countries with access\n\n00:03:05.958 --> 00:03:07.958\nto multiple channels of communication\n\n00:03:07.958 --> 00:03:09.958\nand information have a particular advantage.\n\n00:03:09.958 --> 00:03:13.958\nAnd of course they have more influence, sometimes, about how they're seen.\n\n00:03:13.958 --> 00:03:15.958\nIndia has more all-news TV channels\n\n00:03:15.958 --> 00:03:17.958\nthan any country in the world,\n\n00:03:17.958 --> 00:03:21.958\nin fact in most of the countries in this part of the world put together.\n\n00:03:21.958 --> 00:03:23.958\nBut, the fact still is that it's not just that.\n\n00:03:23.958 --> 00:03:26.958\nIn order to have soft power, you have to be connected.\n\n00:03:26.958 --> 00:03:28.958\nOne might argue that India has become\n\n00:03:28.958 --> 00:03:30.958\nan astonishingly connected country.\n\n00:03:30.958 --> 00:03:32.958\nI think you've already heard the figures.\n\n00:03:32.958 --> 00:03:36.958\nWe've been selling 15 million cellphones a month.\n\n00:03:36.958 --> 00:03:39.958\nCurrently there are 509 million cellphones\n\n00:03:39.958 --> 00:03:41.958\nin Indian hands, in India.\n\n00:03:41.958 --> 00:03:45.958\nAnd that makes us larger than the U.S. as a telephone market.\n\n00:03:45.958 --> 00:03:48.958\nIn fact, those 15 million cellphones\n\n00:03:48.958 --> 00:03:50.958\nare the most connections that any country,\n\n00:03:50.958 --> 00:03:52.958\nincluding the U.S. and China,\n\n00:03:52.958 --> 00:03:55.958\nhas ever established in the history of telecommunications.\n\n00:03:55.958 --> 00:03:57.958\nBut, what perhaps some of you don't realize\n\n00:03:57.958 --> 00:03:59.958\nis how far we've come to get there.\n\n00:03:59.958 --> 00:04:01.958\nYou know, when I grew up in India,\n\n00:04:01.958 --> 00:04:03.958\ntelephones were a rarity.\n\n00:04:03.958 --> 00:04:05.958\nIn fact, they were so rare that elected members of Parliament\n\n00:04:05.958 --> 00:04:08.958\nhad the right to allocate 15 telephone lines\n\n00:04:08.958 --> 00:04:10.958\nas a favor to those they deemed worthy.\n\n00:04:10.958 --> 00:04:13.958\nIf you were lucky enough to be a wealthy businessman\n\n00:04:13.958 --> 00:04:16.958\nor an influential journalist, or a doctor or something, you might have a telephone.\n\n00:04:16.958 --> 00:04:18.958\nBut sometimes it just sat there.\n\n00:04:18.958 --> 00:04:20.958\nI went to high school in Calcutta.\n\n00:04:20.958 --> 00:04:22.958\nAnd we would look at this instrument sitting in the front foyer.\n\n00:04:22.958 --> 00:04:24.958\nBut half the time we would pick it up\n\n00:04:24.958 --> 00:04:26.958\nwith an expectant look on our faces,\n\n00:04:26.958 --> 00:04:28.958\nthere would be no dial tone.\n\n00:04:28.958 --> 00:04:30.958\nIf there was a dial tone and you dialed a number,\n\n00:04:30.958 --> 00:04:34.958\nthe odds were two in three you wouldn't get the number you were intending to reach.\n\n00:04:34.958 --> 00:04:37.958\nIn fact the words \"wrong number\" were more popular than the word \"Hello.\"\n\n00:04:37.958 --> 00:04:38.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:04:38.958 --> 00:04:40.958\nIf you then wanted to connect to another city,\n\n00:04:40.958 --> 00:04:42.958\nlet's say from Calcutta you wanted to call Delhi,\n\n00:04:42.958 --> 00:04:44.958\nyou'd have to book something called a trunk call,\n\n00:04:44.958 --> 00:04:47.958\nand then sit by the phone all day, waiting for it to come through.\n\n00:04:47.958 --> 00:04:50.958\nOr you could pay eight times the going rate\n\n00:04:50.958 --> 00:04:52.958\nfor something called a lightning call.\n\n00:04:52.958 --> 00:04:54.958\nBut, lightning struck rather slowly in our country in those days,\n\n00:04:54.958 --> 00:04:58.958\nso, it was like about a half an hour for a lightning call to come through.\n\n00:04:58.958 --> 00:05:01.958\nIn fact, so woeful was our telephone service\n\n00:05:01.958 --> 00:05:05.958\nthat a Member of Parliament stood up in 1984 and complained about this.\n\n00:05:05.958 --> 00:05:08.958\nAnd the Then-Communications Minister replied in a lordly manner\n\n00:05:08.958 --> 00:05:10.958\nthat in a developing country\n\n00:05:10.958 --> 00:05:12.958\ncommunications are a luxury, not a right,\n\n00:05:12.958 --> 00:05:16.958\nthat the government had no obligation to provide better service,\n\n00:05:16.958 --> 00:05:18.958\nand if the honorable Member wasn't satisfied with his telephone,\n\n00:05:18.958 --> 00:05:21.958\ncould he please return it, since there was an eight-year-long waiting list\n\n00:05:21.958 --> 00:05:24.958\nfor telephones in India.\n\n00:05:24.958 --> 00:05:26.958\nNow, fast-forward to today and this is what you see:\n\n00:05:26.958 --> 00:05:28.958\nthe 15 million cell phones a month.\n\n00:05:28.958 --> 00:05:32.958\nBut what is most striking is who is carrying those cell phones.\n\n00:05:32.958 --> 00:05:35.958\nYou know, if you visit friends in the suburbs of Delhi,\n\n00:05:35.958 --> 00:05:38.958\non the side streets you will find a fellow with a cart\n\n00:05:38.958 --> 00:05:41.958\nthat looks like it was designed in the 16th century,\n\n00:05:41.958 --> 00:05:44.958\nwielding a coal-fired steam iron\n\n00:05:44.958 --> 00:05:46.958\nthat might have been invented in the 18th century.\n\n00:05:46.958 --> 00:05:49.958\nHe's called an isthri wala. But he's carrying a 21st-century instrument.\n\n00:05:49.958 --> 00:05:52.958\nHe's carrying a cell phone because most incoming calls are free,\n\n00:05:52.958 --> 00:05:54.958\nand that's how he gets orders from the neighborhood,\n\n00:05:54.958 --> 00:05:58.958\nto know where to collect clothes to get them ironed.\n\n00:05:58.958 --> 00:06:01.958\nThe other day I was in Kerala, my home state,\n\n00:06:01.958 --> 00:06:03.958\nat the country farm of a friend,\n\n00:06:03.958 --> 00:06:07.958\nabout 20 kilometers away from any place you'd consider urban.\n\n00:06:07.958 --> 00:06:10.958\nAnd it was a hot day and he said, \"Hey, would you like some fresh coconut water?\"\n\n00:06:10.958 --> 00:06:13.958\nAnd it's the best thing and the most nutritious and refreshing thing you can drink\n\n00:06:13.958 --> 00:06:16.958\non a hot day in the tropics, so I said sure.\n\n00:06:16.958 --> 00:06:18.958\nAnd he whipped out his cellphone, dialed the number,\n\n00:06:18.958 --> 00:06:20.958\nand a voice said, \"I'm up here.\"\n\n00:06:20.958 --> 00:06:22.958\nAnd right on top of the nearest coconut tree,\n\n00:06:22.958 --> 00:06:25.958\nwith a hatchet in one hand and a cell phone in the other,\n\n00:06:25.958 --> 00:06:27.958\nwas a local toddy tapper,\n\n00:06:27.958 --> 00:06:30.958\nwho proceeded to bring down the coconuts for us to drink.\n\n00:06:30.958 --> 00:06:33.958\nFishermen are going out to sea and carrying their cell phones.\n\n00:06:33.958 --> 00:06:36.958\nWhen they catch the fish they call all the market towns along the coast\n\n00:06:36.958 --> 00:06:38.958\nto find out where they get the best possible prices.\n\n00:06:38.958 --> 00:06:42.958\nFarmers now, who used to have to spend half a day of backbreaking labor\n\n00:06:42.958 --> 00:06:44.958\nto find out if the market town was open,\n\n00:06:44.958 --> 00:06:46.958\nif the market was on,\n\n00:06:46.958 --> 00:06:49.958\nwhether the product they'd harvested could be sold, what price they'd fetch.\n\n00:06:49.958 --> 00:06:52.958\nThey'd often send an eight year old boy all the way on this trudge\n\n00:06:52.958 --> 00:06:54.958\nto the market town to get that information and come back,\n\n00:06:54.958 --> 00:06:56.958\nthen they'd load the cart.\n\n00:06:56.958 --> 00:07:00.958\nToday they're saving half a day's labor with a two minute phone call.\n\n00:07:00.958 --> 00:07:03.958\nSo this empowerment of the underclass\n\n00:07:03.958 --> 00:07:06.958\nis the real result of India being connected.\n\n00:07:06.958 --> 00:07:11.958\nAnd that transformation is part of where India is heading today.\n\n00:07:11.958 --> 00:07:14.958\nBut, of course that's not the only thing about India that's spreading.\n\n00:07:14.958 --> 00:07:17.958\nYou've got Bollywood. My attitude to Bollywood is best summarized\n\n00:07:17.958 --> 00:07:20.958\nin the tale of the two goats at a Bollywood garbage dump --\n\n00:07:20.958 --> 00:07:24.958\nMr. Shekhar Kapur, forgive me --\n\n00:07:24.958 --> 00:07:28.958\nand they're chewing away on cans of celluloid discarded by a Bollywood studio.\n\n00:07:28.958 --> 00:07:31.958\nAnd the first goat, chewing away, says, \"You know, this film is not bad.\"\n\n00:07:31.958 --> 00:07:35.958\nAnd the second goat says, \"No, the book was better.\"\n\n00:07:35.958 --> 00:07:41.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:07:41.958 --> 00:07:44.958\nI usually tend to think that the book is usually better,\n\n00:07:44.958 --> 00:07:46.958\nbut, having said that,\n\n00:07:46.958 --> 00:07:48.958\nthe fact is that Bollywood is now\n\n00:07:48.958 --> 00:07:52.958\ntaking a certain aspect of Indian-ness and Indian culture around the globe,\n\n00:07:52.958 --> 00:07:55.958\nnot just in the Indian diaspora in the U.S. and the U.K.,\n\n00:07:55.958 --> 00:07:59.958\nbut to the screens of Arabs and Africans, of Senegalese and Syrians.\n\n00:07:59.958 --> 00:08:02.958\nI've met a young man in New York whose illiterate mother\n\n00:08:02.958 --> 00:08:04.958\nin a village in Senegal\n\n00:08:04.958 --> 00:08:07.958\ntakes a bus once a month to the capital city of Dakar,\n\n00:08:07.958 --> 00:08:09.958\njust to watch a Bollywood movie.\n\n00:08:09.958 --> 00:08:11.958\nShe can't understand the dialogue.\n\n00:08:11.958 --> 00:08:14.958\nShe's illiterate, so she can't read the French subtitles.\n\n00:08:14.958 --> 00:08:17.958\nBut these movies are made to be understood despite such handicaps,\n\n00:08:17.958 --> 00:08:20.958\nand she has a great time in the song and the dance and the action.\n\n00:08:20.958 --> 00:08:24.958\nShe goes away with stars in her eyes about India, as a result.\n\n00:08:24.958 --> 00:08:26.958\nAnd this is happening more and more.\n\n00:08:26.958 --> 00:08:29.958\nAfghanistan, we know what a serious security problem\n\n00:08:29.958 --> 00:08:32.958\nAfghanistan is for so many of us in the world.\n\n00:08:32.958 --> 00:08:34.958\nIndia doesn't have a military mission there.\n\n00:08:34.958 --> 00:08:38.958\nYou know what was India's biggest asset in Afghanistan in the last seven years?\n\n00:08:38.958 --> 00:08:40.958\nOne simple fact:\n\n00:08:40.958 --> 00:08:43.958\nyou couldn't try to call an Afghan at 8:30 in the evening.\n\n00:08:43.958 --> 00:08:45.958\nWhy? Because that was the moment\n\n00:08:45.958 --> 00:08:47.958\nwhen the Indian television soap opera,\n\n00:08:47.958 --> 00:08:53.958\n\"Kyunki Saas Bhi Kabhi Bahu Thi,\" dubbed into Dari, was telecast on Tolo T.V.\n\n00:08:53.958 --> 00:08:56.958\nAnd it was the most popular television show in Afghan history.\n\n00:08:56.958 --> 00:08:58.958\nEvery Afghan family wanted to watch it.\n\n00:08:58.958 --> 00:09:00.958\nThey had to suspend functions at 8:30.\n\n00:09:00.958 --> 00:09:03.958\nWeddings were reported to be interrupted\n\n00:09:03.958 --> 00:09:05.958\nso guests could cluster around the T.V. set,\n\n00:09:05.958 --> 00:09:08.958\nand then turn their attention back to the bride and groom.\n\n00:09:08.958 --> 00:09:11.958\nCrime went up at 8:30. I have read a Reuters dispatch --\n\n00:09:11.958 --> 00:09:14.958\nso this is not Indian propaganda, a British news agency --\n\n00:09:14.958 --> 00:09:17.958\nabout how robbers in the town of Musarri Sharif*\n\n00:09:17.958 --> 00:09:20.958\nstripped a vehicle of its windshield wipers,\n\n00:09:20.958 --> 00:09:23.958\nits hubcaps, its sideview mirrors,\n\n00:09:23.958 --> 00:09:26.958\nany moving part they could find, at 8:30,\n\n00:09:26.958 --> 00:09:29.958\nbecause the watchmen were busy watching the T.V. rather than minding the store.\n\n00:09:29.958 --> 00:09:33.958\nAnd they scrawled on the windshield in a reference to the show's heroine,\n\n00:09:33.958 --> 00:09:36.958\n\"Tulsi Zindabad\": \"Long live Tulsi.\"\n\n00:09:36.958 --> 00:09:37.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:09:37.958 --> 00:09:41.958\nThat's soft power. And that is what India is developing\n\n00:09:41.958 --> 00:09:43.958\nthrough the \"E\" part of TED:\n\n00:09:43.958 --> 00:09:45.958\nits own entertainment industry.\n\n00:09:45.958 --> 00:09:48.958\nThe same is true, of course -- we don't have time for too many more examples --\n\n00:09:48.958 --> 00:09:51.958\nbut it's true of our music, of our dance,\n\n00:09:51.958 --> 00:09:55.958\nof our art, yoga, ayurveda, even Indian cuisine.\n\n00:09:55.958 --> 00:09:58.958\nI mean, the proliferation of Indian restaurants\n\n00:09:58.958 --> 00:10:01.958\nsince I first went abroad as a student, in the mid '70s,\n\n00:10:01.958 --> 00:10:05.958\nand what I see today, you can't go to a mid-size town in Europe or North America\n\n00:10:05.958 --> 00:10:08.958\nand not find an Indian restaurant. It may not be a very good one.\n\n00:10:08.958 --> 00:10:10.958\nBut, today in Britain, for example,\n\n00:10:10.958 --> 00:10:13.958\nIndian restaurants in Britain\n\n00:10:13.958 --> 00:10:15.958\nemploy more people than the coal mining,\n\n00:10:15.958 --> 00:10:18.958\nship building and iron and steel industries combined.\n\n00:10:18.958 --> 00:10:20.958\nSo the empire can strike back.\n\n00:10:20.958 --> 00:10:27.958\n(Applause)\n\n00:10:27.958 --> 00:10:29.958\nBut, with this increasing awareness of India,\n\n00:10:29.958 --> 00:10:31.958\nwith you and with I, and so on,\n\n00:10:31.958 --> 00:10:33.958\nwith tales like Afghanistan,\n\n00:10:33.958 --> 00:10:36.958\ncomes something vital in the information era,\n\n00:10:36.958 --> 00:10:39.958\nthe sense that in today's world\n\n00:10:39.958 --> 00:10:42.958\nit's not the side of the bigger army that wins,\n\n00:10:42.958 --> 00:10:45.958\nit's the country that tells a better story that prevails.\n\n00:10:45.958 --> 00:10:50.958\nAnd India is, and must remain, in my view, the land of the better story.\n\n00:10:50.958 --> 00:10:53.958\nStereotypes are changing. I mean, again, having gone to the U.S.\n\n00:10:53.958 --> 00:10:55.958\nas a student in the mid '70s,\n\n00:10:55.958 --> 00:10:58.958\nI knew what the image of India was then, if there was an image at all.\n\n00:10:58.958 --> 00:11:01.958\nToday, people in Silicon Valley and elsewhere\n\n00:11:01.958 --> 00:11:04.958\nspeak of the IITs, the Indian Institutes of Technology\n\n00:11:04.958 --> 00:11:08.958\nwith the same reverence they used to accord to MIT.\n\n00:11:08.958 --> 00:11:10.958\nThis can sometimes have unintended consequences. OK.\n\n00:11:10.958 --> 00:11:13.958\nI had a friend, a history major like me,\n\n00:11:13.958 --> 00:11:16.958\nwho was accosted at Schiphol Airport in Amsterdam,\n\n00:11:16.958 --> 00:11:18.958\nby an anxiously perspiring European saying,\n\n00:11:18.958 --> 00:11:21.958\n\"You're Indian, you're Indian! Can you help me fix my laptop?\"\n\n00:11:21.958 --> 00:11:23.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:11:23.958 --> 00:11:26.958\nWe've gone from the image of India as\n\n00:11:26.958 --> 00:11:29.958\nland of fakirs lying on beds of nails,\n\n00:11:29.958 --> 00:11:32.958\nand snake charmers with the Indian rope trick,\n\n00:11:32.958 --> 00:11:35.958\nto the image of India as a land of mathematical geniuses,\n\n00:11:35.958 --> 00:11:37.958\ncomputer wizards, software gurus.\n\n00:11:37.958 --> 00:11:42.958\nBut that too is transforming the Indian story around the world.\n\n00:11:42.958 --> 00:11:44.958\nBut, there is something more substantive to that.\n\n00:11:44.958 --> 00:11:46.958\nThe story rests on a fundamental platform\n\n00:11:46.958 --> 00:11:48.958\nof political pluralism.\n\n00:11:48.958 --> 00:11:50.958\nIt's a civilizational story to begin with.\n\n00:11:50.958 --> 00:11:55.958\nBecause India has been an open society for millennia.\n\n00:11:55.958 --> 00:12:00.958\nIndia gave refuge to the Jews, fleeing the destruction of the first temple\n\n00:12:00.958 --> 00:12:03.958\nby the Babylonians, and said thereafter by the Romans.\n\n00:12:03.958 --> 00:12:08.958\nIn fact, legend has is that when Doubting Thomas, the Apostle, Saint Thomas,\n\n00:12:08.958 --> 00:12:10.958\nlanded on the shores of Kerala, my home state,\n\n00:12:10.958 --> 00:12:12.958\nsomewhere around 52 A.D.,\n\n00:12:12.958 --> 00:12:15.958\nhe was welcomed on shore by a flute-playing Jewish girl.\n\n00:12:15.958 --> 00:12:19.958\nAnd to this day remains the only Jewish diaspora\n\n00:12:19.958 --> 00:12:21.958\nin the history of the Jewish people, which has never encountered\n\n00:12:21.958 --> 00:12:24.958\na single incident of anti-semitism.\n\n00:12:24.958 --> 00:12:30.958\n(Applause)\n\n00:12:30.958 --> 00:12:32.958\nThat's the Indian story.\n\n00:12:32.958 --> 00:12:34.958\nIslam came peacefully to the south,\n\n00:12:34.958 --> 00:12:36.958\nslightly more differently complicated history in the north.\n\n00:12:36.958 --> 00:12:41.958\nBut all of these religions have found a place and a welcome home in India.\n\n00:12:41.958 --> 00:12:44.958\nYou know, we just celebrated, this year, our general elections,\n\n00:12:44.958 --> 00:12:47.958\nthe biggest exercise in democratic franchise in human history.\n\n00:12:47.958 --> 00:12:49.958\nAnd the next one will be even bigger, because our voting population\n\n00:12:49.958 --> 00:12:52.958\nkeeps growing by 20 million a year.\n\n00:12:52.958 --> 00:12:54.958\nBut, the fact is\n\n00:12:54.958 --> 00:12:56.958\nthat the last elections, five years ago,\n\n00:12:56.958 --> 00:12:58.958\ngave the world extraordinary phenomenon\n\n00:12:58.958 --> 00:13:02.958\nof an election being won by a woman political leader\n\n00:13:02.958 --> 00:13:05.958\nof Italian origin and Roman Catholic faith, Sonia Gandhi,\n\n00:13:05.958 --> 00:13:08.958\nwho then made way for a Sikh, Mohan Singh,\n\n00:13:08.958 --> 00:13:10.958\nto be sworn in as Prime Minister\n\n00:13:10.958 --> 00:13:13.958\nby a Muslim, President Abdul Kalam,\n\n00:13:13.958 --> 00:13:15.958\nin a country 81 percent Hindu.\n\n00:13:15.958 --> 00:13:24.958\n(Applause)\n\n00:13:24.958 --> 00:13:27.958\nThis is India, and of course it's all the more striking\n\n00:13:27.958 --> 00:13:29.958\nbecause it was four years later that we all applauded\n\n00:13:29.958 --> 00:13:33.958\nthe U.S., the oldest democracy in the modern world,\n\n00:13:33.958 --> 00:13:36.958\nmore than 220 years of free and fair elections,\n\n00:13:36.958 --> 00:13:40.958\nwhich took till last year to elect a president or a vice president\n\n00:13:40.958 --> 00:13:42.958\nwho wasn't white, male or Christian.\n\n00:13:42.958 --> 00:13:45.958\nSo, maybe -- oh sorry, he is Christian, I beg your pardon --\n\n00:13:45.958 --> 00:13:47.958\nand he is male, but he isn't white.\n\n00:13:47.958 --> 00:13:49.958\nAll the others have been all those three.\n\n00:13:49.958 --> 00:13:51.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:13:51.958 --> 00:13:53.958\nAll his predecessors have been all those three,\n\n00:13:53.958 --> 00:13:55.958\nand that's the point I was trying to make.\n\n00:13:55.958 --> 00:13:56.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:13:56.958 --> 00:13:58.958\nBut, the issue is\n\n00:13:58.958 --> 00:14:00.958\nthat when I talked about that example,\n\n00:14:00.958 --> 00:14:05.958\nit's not just about talking about India, it's not propaganda.\n\n00:14:05.958 --> 00:14:08.958\nBecause ultimately, that electoral outcome\n\n00:14:08.958 --> 00:14:10.958\nhad nothing to do with the rest of the world.\n\n00:14:10.958 --> 00:14:12.958\nIt was essentially India being itself.\n\n00:14:12.958 --> 00:14:14.958\nAnd ultimately, it seems to me,\n\n00:14:14.958 --> 00:14:16.958\nthat always works better than propaganda.\n\n00:14:16.958 --> 00:14:19.958\nGovernments aren't very good at telling stories.\n\n00:14:19.958 --> 00:14:21.958\nBut people see a society for what it is,\n\n00:14:21.958 --> 00:14:23.958\nand that, it seems to me, is what ultimately\n\n00:14:23.958 --> 00:14:27.958\nwill make a difference in today's information era,\n\n00:14:27.958 --> 00:14:29.958\nin today's TED age.\n\n00:14:29.958 --> 00:14:32.958\nSo India now is no longer\n\n00:14:32.958 --> 00:14:36.958\nthe nationalism of ethnicity or language or religion,\n\n00:14:36.958 --> 00:14:38.958\nbecause we have every ethnicity known to mankind, practically,\n\n00:14:38.958 --> 00:14:40.958\nwe've every religion know to mankind,\n\n00:14:40.958 --> 00:14:42.958\nwith the possible exception of Shintoism,\n\n00:14:42.958 --> 00:14:45.958\nthough that has some Hindu elements somewhere.\n\n00:14:45.958 --> 00:14:50.958\nWe have 23 official languages that are recognized in our Constitution.\n\n00:14:50.958 --> 00:14:52.958\nAnd those of you who cashed your money here\n\n00:14:52.958 --> 00:14:55.958\nmight be surprised to see how many scripts there are\n\n00:14:55.958 --> 00:14:57.958\non the rupee note, spelling out the denominations.\n\n00:14:57.958 --> 00:14:59.958\nWe've got all of that.\n\n00:14:59.958 --> 00:15:01.958\nWe don't even have geography uniting us,\n\n00:15:01.958 --> 00:15:04.958\nbecause the natural geography of the subcontinent\n\n00:15:04.958 --> 00:15:06.958\nframed by the mountains and the sea was hacked\n\n00:15:06.958 --> 00:15:09.958\nby the partition with Pakistan in 1947.\n\n00:15:09.958 --> 00:15:12.958\nIn fact, you can't even take the name of the country for granted,\n\n00:15:12.958 --> 00:15:14.958\nbecause the name \"India\" comes from the river Indus,\n\n00:15:14.958 --> 00:15:16.958\nwhich flows in Pakistan.\n\n00:15:16.958 --> 00:15:19.958\nBut, the whole point is that India\n\n00:15:19.958 --> 00:15:21.958\nis the nationalism of an idea.\n\n00:15:21.958 --> 00:15:24.958\nIt's the idea of an ever-ever-land,\n\n00:15:24.958 --> 00:15:26.958\nemerging from an ancient civilization,\n\n00:15:26.958 --> 00:15:28.958\nunited by a shared history,\n\n00:15:28.958 --> 00:15:31.958\nbut sustained, above all, by pluralist democracy.\n\n00:15:31.958 --> 00:15:35.958\nThat is a 21st-century story as well as an ancient one.\n\n00:15:35.958 --> 00:15:38.958\nAnd it's the nationalism of an idea that\n\n00:15:38.958 --> 00:15:42.958\nessentially says you can endure differences of caste, creed,\n\n00:15:42.958 --> 00:15:47.958\ncolor, culture, cuisine, custom and costume, consonant, for that matter,\n\n00:15:47.958 --> 00:15:50.958\nand still rally around a consensus.\n\n00:15:50.958 --> 00:15:52.958\nAnd the consensus is of a very simple principle,\n\n00:15:52.958 --> 00:15:56.958\nthat in a diverse plural democracy like India\n\n00:15:56.958 --> 00:16:00.958\nyou don't really have to agree on everything all the time,\n\n00:16:00.958 --> 00:16:02.958\nso long as you agree on the ground rules\n\n00:16:02.958 --> 00:16:04.958\nof how you will disagree.\n\n00:16:04.958 --> 00:16:06.958\nThe great success story of India,\n\n00:16:06.958 --> 00:16:09.958\na country that so many learned scholars and journalists\n\n00:16:09.958 --> 00:16:12.958\nassumed would disintegrate, in the '50s and '60s,\n\n00:16:12.958 --> 00:16:17.958\nis that it managed to maintain consensus on how to survive without consensus.\n\n00:16:17.958 --> 00:16:21.958\nNow, that is the India that is emerging into the 21st century.\n\n00:16:21.958 --> 00:16:23.958\nAnd I do want to make the point\n\n00:16:23.958 --> 00:16:26.958\nthat if there is anything worth celebrating about India,\n\n00:16:26.958 --> 00:16:28.958\nit isn't military muscle, economic power.\n\n00:16:28.958 --> 00:16:30.958\nAll of that is necessary,\n\n00:16:30.958 --> 00:16:33.958\nbut we still have huge amounts of problems to overcome.\n\n00:16:33.958 --> 00:16:36.958\nSomebody said we are super poor, and we are also super power.\n\n00:16:36.958 --> 00:16:38.958\nWe can't really be both of those.\n\n00:16:38.958 --> 00:16:40.958\nWe have to overcome our poverty. We have to deal with the\n\n00:16:40.958 --> 00:16:42.958\nhardware of development,\n\n00:16:42.958 --> 00:16:44.958\nthe ports, the roads, the airports,\n\n00:16:44.958 --> 00:16:46.958\nall the infrastructural things we need to do,\n\n00:16:46.958 --> 00:16:48.958\nand the software of development,\n\n00:16:48.958 --> 00:16:52.958\nthe human capital, the need for the ordinary person in India\n\n00:16:52.958 --> 00:16:55.958\nto be able to have a couple of square meals a day,\n\n00:16:55.958 --> 00:16:57.958\nto be able to send his or her children\n\n00:16:57.958 --> 00:16:59.958\nto a decent school,\n\n00:16:59.958 --> 00:17:01.958\nand to aspire to work a job\n\n00:17:01.958 --> 00:17:04.958\nthat will give them opportunities in their lives\n\n00:17:04.958 --> 00:17:06.958\nthat can transform themselves.\n\n00:17:06.958 --> 00:17:10.958\nBut, it's all taking place, this great adventure of conquering those challenges,\n\n00:17:10.958 --> 00:17:13.958\nthose real challenges which none of us can pretend don't exist.\n\n00:17:13.958 --> 00:17:16.958\nBut, it's all taking place in an open society,\n\n00:17:16.958 --> 00:17:19.958\nin a rich and diverse and plural civilization,\n\n00:17:19.958 --> 00:17:22.958\nin one that is determined to liberate and fulfill\n\n00:17:22.958 --> 00:17:24.958\nthe creative energies of its people.\n\n00:17:24.958 --> 00:17:27.958\nThat's why India belongs at TED,\n\n00:17:27.958 --> 00:17:29.958\nand that's why TED belongs in India.\n\n00:17:29.958 --> 00:17:31.958\nThank you very much.\n\n00:17:31.958 --> 00:17:44.958\n(Applause)"}, {"title": "Global ethic vs. national interest", "duration": "1030", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/gordon_brown_on_global_ethic_vs_national_interest", "transcript": "Chris Anderson: Thank you so much, Prime Minister, that was both fascinating and quite inspiring. So, you're calling for a global ethic. Would you describe that as global citizenship? Is that an idea that you believe in, and how would you define that?Gordon Brown: It is about global citizenship and recognizing our responsibilities to others. There is so much to do over the next few years that is obvious to so many of us to build a better world. And there is so much shared sense of what we need to do, that it is vital that we all come together. But we don't necessarily have the means to do so.So there are challenges to be met. I believe the concept of global citizenship will simply grow out of people talking to each other across continents. But of course the task is to create the institutions that make that global society work. But I don't think we should underestimate the extent to which massive changes in technology make possible the linking up of people across the world.CA: But people get excited about this idea of global citizenship, but then they get confused a bit again when they start thinking about patriotism, and how to combine these two. I mean, you're elected as Prime Minister with a brief to bat for Britain. How do you reconcile the two things?GB: Well, of course national identity remains important. But it's not at the expense of people accepting their global responsibilities. And I think one of the problems of recession is that people become more protectionist, they look in on themselves, they try to protect their own nation, perhaps at the expense of other nations. When you actually look at the motor of the world economy, it cannot move forward unless there is trade between the different countries. And any nation that would become protectionist over the next few years would deprive itself of the chance of getting the benefits of growth in the world economy.So, you've got to have a healthy sense of patriotism; that's absolutely important. But you've got to realize that this world has changed fundamentally, and the problems we have cannot be solved by one nation and one nation alone.CA: Well, indeed. But what do you do when the two come into conflict and you're forced to make a decision that either is in Britain's interest, or the interest of Britons, or citizens elsewhere in the world?GB: Well I think we can persuade people that what is necessary for Britain's long-term interests, what is necessary for America's long-term interests, is proper engagement with the rest of the world, and taking the action that is necessary.There is a great story, again, told about Richard Nixon. 1958, Ghana becomes independent, so it is just over 50 years ago. Richard Nixon goes to represent the United States government at the celebrations for independence in Ghana. And it's one of his first outings as Vice President to an African country. He doesn't quite know what to do, so he starts going around the crowd and starts talking to people and he says to people in this rather unique way, \"How does it feel to be free?\" And he's going around, \"How does it feel to be free?\" \"How does it feel to be free?\" And then someone says, \"How should I know? I come from Alabama.\"(Laughter)And that was the 1950s. Now, what is remarkable is that civil rights in America were achieved in the 1960s. But what is equally remarkable is socioeconomic rights in Africa have not moved forward very fast even since the age of colonialism. And yet, America and Africa have got a common interest. And we have got to realize that if we don't link up with those people who are sensible voices and democratic voices in Africa, to work together for common causes, then the danger of Al Qaeda and related groups making progress in Africa is very big.So, I would say that what seems sometimes to be altruism, in relation to Africa, or in relation to developing countries, is more than that. It is enlightened self-interest for us to work with other countries. And I would say that national interest and, if you like, what is the global interest to tackle poverty and climate change do, in the long run, come together. And whatever the short-run price for taking action on climate change or on security, or taking action to provide opportunities for people for education, these are prices that are worth paying so that you build a stronger global society where people feel able to feel comfortable with each other and are able to communicate with each other in such a way that you can actually build stronger links between different countries.CA: I still just want to draw out on this issue. So, you're on vacation at a nice beach, and word comes through that there's been a massive earthquake and that there is a tsunami advancing on the beach. One end of the beach, there is a house containing a family of five Nigerians. And at the other end of the beach there is a single Brit. You have time to \u2014(Laughter)you have time to alert one house. What do you do?(Laughter)GB: Modern communications.(Applause)Alert both.(Applause)I do agree that my responsibility is first of all to make sure that people in our country are safe. And I wouldn't like anything that is said today to suggest that I am diminishing the importance of the responsibility that each leader has for their own country.But I'm trying to suggest that there is a huge opportunity open to us that was never open to us before. But the power to communicate across borders allows us to organize the world in a different way. And I think, look at the tsunami, it's a classic example. Where was the early warning systems? Where was the world acting together to deal with the problems that they knew arose from the potential for earthquakes, as well as the potential for climate change? And when the world starts to work together, with better early-warning systems, you can deal with some of these problems in a better way. I just think we're not seeing, at the moment, the huge opportunities open to us by the ability of people to cooperate in a world where either there was isolationism before or there was limited alliances based on convenience which never actually took you to deal with some of the central problems.CA: But I think this is the frustration that perhaps a lot of people have, like people in the audience here, where we love the kind of language that you're talking about. It is inspiring. A lot of us believe that that has to be the world's future. And yet, when the situation changes, you suddenly hear politicians talking as if, you know, for example, the life of one American soldier is worth countless numbers of Iraqi civilians. When the pedal hits the metal, the idealism can get moved away. I'm just wondering whether you can see that changing over time, whether you see in Britain that there are changing attitudes, and that people are actually more supportive of the kind of global ethic that you talk about.GB: I think every religion, every faith, and I'm not just talking here to people of faith or religion \u2014 it has this global ethic at the center of its credo. And whether it's Jewish or whether it's Muslim or whether it's Hindu, or whether it's Sikh, the same global ethic is at the heart of each of these religions. So, I think you're dealing with something that people instinctively see as part of their moral sense. So you're building on something that is not pure self-interest. You're building on people's ideas and values \u2014 that perhaps they're candles that burn very dimly on certain occasions. But it is a set of values that cannot, in my view, be extinguished.Then the question is, how do you make that change happen? How do you persuade people that it is in their interest to build strong \u2014 After the Second World War, we built institutions, the United Nations, the IMF, the World Bank, the World Trade Organization, the Marshall Plan. There was a period in which people talked about an act of creation, because these institutions were so new. But they are now out of date. They don't deal with the problems. You can't deal with the environmental problem through existing institutions. You can't deal with the security problem in the way that you need to. You can't deal with the economic and financial problem. So we have got to rebuild our global institutions, build them in a way that is suitable to the challenges of this time.And I believe that if you look at the biggest challenge we face, it is to persuade people to have the confidence that we can build a truly global society with the institutions that are founded on these rules. So, I come back to my initial point. Sometimes you think things are impossible. Nobody would have said 50 years ago that apartheid would have gone in 1990, or that the Berlin wall would have fallen at the turn of the '80s and '90s, or that polio could be eradicated, or perhaps 60 years ago, nobody would have said a man could gone to the Moon. All these things have happened. By tackling the impossible, you make the impossible possible.CA: And we have had a speaker who said that very thing, and swallowed a sword right after that, which was quite dramatic.(Laughter)GB: Followed my sword and swallow.CA: But, surely a true global ethic is for someone to say, \"I believe that the life of every human on the planet is worth the same, equal consideration, regardless of nationality and religion.\" And you have politicians who have \u2014 you're elected. In a way, you can't say that. Even if, as a human being, you believe that, you can't say that. You're elected for Britain's interests.GB: We have a responsibility to protect. I mean look, 1918, the Treaty of Versailles, and all the treaties before that, the Treaty of Westphalia and everything else, were about protecting the sovereign right of countries to do what they want. Since then, the world has moved forward, partly as a result of what happened with the Holocaust, and people's concern about the rights of individuals within territories where they need protection, partly because of what we saw in Rwanda, partly because of what we saw in Bosnia. The idea of the responsibility to protect all individuals who are in situations where they are at humanitarian risk is now being established as a principle which governs the world.So, while I can't automatically say that Britain will rush to the aid of any citizen of any country, in danger, I can say that Britain is in a position where we're working with other countries so that this idea that you have a responsibility to protect people who are victims of either genocide or humanitarian attack, is something that is accepted by the whole world.Now, in the end, that can only be achieved if your international institutions work well enough to be able to do so. And that comes back to what the future role of the United Nations, and what it can do, actually is. But, the responsibility to protect is a new idea that is, in a sense, taken over from the idea of self-determination as the principle governing the international community.CA: Can you picture, in our lifetimes, a politician ever going out on a platform of the kind of full-form global ethic, global citizenship? And basically saying, \"I believe that all people across the planet have equal consideration, and if in power we will act in that way. And we believe that the people of this country are also now global citizens and will support that ethic.\"GB: Is that not what we're doing in the debate about climate change? We're saying that you cannot solve the problem of climate change in one country; you've got to involve all countries. You're saying that you must, and you have a duty to help those countries that cannot afford to deal with the problems of climate change themselves. You're saying you want a deal with all the different countries of the world where we're all bound together to cutting carbon emissions in a way that is to the benefit of the whole world. We've never had this before because Kyoto didn't work. If you could get a deal at Copenhagen, where people agreed, A, that there was a long-term target for carbon emission cuts, B, that there was short-range targets that had to be met so this wasn't just abstract; it was people actually making decisions now that would make a difference now, and if you could then find a financing mechanism that meant that the poorest countries that had been hurt by our inability to deal with climate change over many, many years and decades are given special help so that they can move to energy-efficient technologies, and they are in a position financially to be able to afford the long-term investment that is associated with cutting carbon emissions, then you are treating the world equally, by giving consideration to every part of the planet and the needs they have.It doesn't mean that everybody does exactly the same thing, because we've actually got to do more financially to help the poorest countries, but it does mean there is equal consideration for the needs of citizens in a single planet.CA: Yes. And then of course the theory is still that those talks get rent apart by different countries fighting over their own individual interests.GB: Yes, but I think Europe has got a position, which is 27 countries have already come together. I mean, the great difficulty in Europe is if you're at a meeting and 27 people speak, it takes a very, very long time. But we did get an agreement on climate change. America has made its first disposition on this with the bill that President Obama should be congratulated for getting through Congress. Japan has made an announcement. China and India have signed up to the scientific evidence. And now we've got to move them to accept a long-term target, and then short-term targets. But more progress has been made, I think, in the last few weeks than had been made for some years.And I do believe that there is a strong possibility that if we work together, we can get that agreement to Copenhagen. I certainly have been putting forward proposals that would have allowed the poorest parts of the world to feel that we have taken into account their specific needs. And we would help them adapt. And we would help them make the transition to a low-carbon economy.I do think a reform of the international institutions is vital to this. When the IMF was created in the 1940s, it was created with resources that were five percent or so of the world's GDP. The IMF now has limited resources, one percent. It can't really make the difference that ought to be made in a period of crisis. So, we've got to rebuild the world institutions. And that's a big task: persuading all the different countries with the different voting shares in these institutions to do so.There is a story told about the three world leaders of the day getting a chance to get some advice from God. And the story is told that Bill Clinton went to God and he asked when there will be successful climate change and a low-carbon economy. And God shook his head and said, \"Not this year, not this decade, perhaps not even in [your] lifetime.\" And Bill Clinton walked away in tears because he had failed to get what he wanted.And then the story is that Barroso, the president of the European Commission, went to God and he asked, \"When will we get a recovery of global growth?\" And God said, \"Not this year, not in this decade, perhaps not in your lifetime.\" So Barroso walked away crying and in tears.And then the Secretary-General of the United Nations came up to speak to God and said, \"When will our international institutions work?\" And God cried.(Laughter)It is very important to recognize that this reform of institutions is the next stage after agreeing upon ourselves that there is a clear ethic upon which we can build.CA: Prime Minister, I think there are many in the audience who are truly appreciative of the efforts you made in terms of the financial mess we got ourselves into. And there are certainly many people in the audience who will be cheering you on as you seek to advance this global ethic.Thank you so much for coming to TED.GB: Well, thank you.(Applause)", "id": 700,

fundamentally,\n\n00:02:21.034 --> 00:02:24.934\nand the problems we have cannot be solved\nby one nation and one nation alone.\n\n00:02:24.958 --> 00:02:26.095\nCA: Well, indeed.\n\n00:02:26.119 --> 00:02:29.434\nBut what do you do\nwhen the two come into conflict\n\n00:02:29.458 --> 00:02:31.459\nand you're forced to make a decision\n\n00:02:31.483 --> 00:02:35.934\nthat either is in Britain's interest,\nor the interest of Britons,\n\n00:02:35.958 --> 00:02:38.317\nor citizens elsewhere in the world?\n\n00:02:38.341 --> 00:02:40.344\nGB: Well I think we can persuade people\n\n00:02:40.368 --> 00:02:43.934\nthat what is necessary\nfor Britain's long-term interests,\n\n00:02:43.958 --> 00:02:46.387\nwhat is necessary\nfor America's long-term interests,\n\n00:02:46.411 --> 00:02:48.697\nis proper engagement\nwith the rest of the world,\n\n00:02:48.721 --> 00:02:53.628\nand taking the action that is necessary.\n\n00:02:53.652 --> 00:02:58.425\nThere is a great story, again,\ntold about Richard Nixon.\n\n00:02:58.449 --> 00:03:02.400\n1958, Ghana becomes independent,\n\n00:03:02.424 --> 00:03:04.212\nso it is just over 50 years ago.\n\n00:03:04.831 --> 00:03:08.822\nRichard Nixon goes to represent\nthe United States government\n\n00:03:08.846 --> 00:03:11.822\nat the celebrations\nfor independence in Ghana.\n\n00:03:12.289 --> 00:03:16.934\nAnd it's one of his first outings\nas Vice President to an African country.\n\n00:03:16.958 --> 00:03:18.598\nHe doesn't quite know what to do,\n\n00:03:18.622 --> 00:03:20.371\nso he starts going around the crowd\n\n00:03:20.395 --> 00:03:21.934\nand starts talking to people\n\n00:03:21.958 --> 00:03:24.244\nand he says to people\nin this rather unique way,\n\n00:03:24.268 --> 00:03:26.485\n\"How does it feel to be free?\"\n\n00:03:26.509 --> 00:03:29.231\nAnd he's going around,\n\"How does it feel to be free?\"\n\n00:03:29.255 --> 00:03:30.842\n\"How does it feel to be free?\"\n\n00:03:30.866 --> 00:03:31.968\nAnd then someone says,\n\n00:03:31.992 --> 00:03:34.139\n\"How should I know? I come from Alabama.\"\n\n00:03:34.163 --> 00:03:36.934\n(Laughter)\n\n00:03:36.958 --> 00:03:40.362\nAnd that was the 1950s.\n\n00:03:40.386 --> 00:03:44.656\nNow, what is remarkable\n\n00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:48.401\nis that civil rights in America\nwere achieved in the 1960s.\n\n00:03:48.958 --> 00:03:50.934\nBut what is equally remarkable\n\n00:03:50.958 --> 00:03:55.934\nis socioeconomic rights in Africa\nhave not moved forward very fast\n\n00:03:55.958 --> 00:03:58.299\neven since the age of colonialism.\n\n00:03:58.958 --> 00:04:02.823\nAnd yet, America and Africa\nhave got a common interest.\n\n00:04:03.188 --> 00:04:05.934\nAnd we have got to realize\nthat if we don't link up\n\n00:04:05.958 --> 00:04:09.934\nwith those people who are sensible voices\nand democratic voices in Africa,\n\n00:04:09.958 --> 00:04:11.934\nto work together for common causes,\n\n00:04:11.958 --> 00:04:14.934\nthen the danger of Al Qaeda\nand related groups\n\n00:04:14.958 --> 00:04:16.934\nmaking progress in Africa is very big.\n\n00:04:16.958 --> 00:04:18.934\nSo, I would say that what seems sometimes\n\n00:04:18.958 --> 00:04:23.776\nto be altruism, in relation to Africa,\nor in relation to developing countries,\n\n00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:24.949\nis more than that.\n\n00:04:24.973 --> 00:04:28.267\nIt is enlightened self-interest\nfor us to work with other countries.\n\n00:04:28.291 --> 00:04:30.141\nAnd I would say that national interest\n\n00:04:30.165 --> 00:04:32.274\nand, if you like,\nwhat is the global interest\n\n00:04:32.298 --> 00:04:34.378\nto tackle poverty and climate

safe.\n\n00:05:44.078 --> 00:05:47.388\nAnd I wouldn't like anything\nthat is said today to suggest\n\n00:05:47.412 --> 00:05:50.141\nthat I am diminishing the importance\nof the

00:06:03.379\nallows us to organize\nthe world in a different way.\n\n00:06:03.910 --> 00:06:07.482\nAnd I think, look at the tsunami,\nit's a classic example.\n\n00:06:07.506 --> 00:06:09.482\nWhere was the early warning systems?\n\n00:06:09.958 --> 00:06:12.744\nWhere was the world acting together\n\n00:06:12.768 --> 00:06:15.003\nto deal with the problems\nthat they knew arose\n\n00:06:15.027

never actually took you to deal\nwith some of the central problems.\n\n00:06:42.448 --> 00:06:44.426\nCA: But I think this is the frustration\n\n00:06:44.450 --> 00:06:47.670\nthat perhaps a lot of people have,\nlike people in the audience here,\n\n00:06:47.694 --> 00:06:50.583\nwhere we love the kind of language\nthat you're talking about.\n\n00:06:50.607 --> 00:06:51.616\nIt is inspiring.\n\n00:06:51.640 --> 00:06:54.934\nA lot of us believe\nthat that has to be the world's future.\n\n00:06:54.958 --> 00:06:57.934\nAnd yet, when the situation changes,\n\n00:06:57.958 --> 00:07:00.740\nyou suddenly hear\npoliticians talking as if,\n\n00:07:00.764 --> 00:07:03.934\nyou know, for example,\nthe life of one American soldier\n\n00:07:03.958 --> 00:07:06.614\nis worth

00:07:19.054\nI'm just wondering whether\nyou can see that changing over time,\n\n00:07:19.078 --> 00:07:20.934\nwhether you see in Britain\n\n00:07:20.958 --> 00:07:22.618\nthat there are changing attitudes,\n\n00:07:22.642 --> 00:07:24.771\nand that people are actually\nmore supportive\n\n00:07:24.795 --> 00:07:27.794\nof the kind of global ethic\nthat you talk about.\n\n00:07:28.389 --> 00:07:31.238\nGB: I think every religion, every faith,\n\n00:07:31.262 --> 00:07:34.367\nand I'm not just talking here\nto people of faith or religion --\n\n00:07:34.391 --> 00:07:38.018\nit has this global ethic\nat the center of its credo.\n\n00:07:38.408 --> 00:07:41.741\nAnd whether it's Jewish\nor whether it's Muslim\n\n00:07:41.765 --> 00:07:44.598\nor whether it's Hindu,\nor whether it's Sikh,\n\n00:07:44.622 --> 00:07:49.617\nthe same global ethic is at the heart\nof each of these religions.\n\n00:07:49.641 --> 00:07:51.934\nSo, I think you're dealing with something\n\n00:07:51.958 --> 00:07:56.749\nthat people instinctively\nsee as part of their moral sense.\n\n00:07:56.773 --> 00:08:00.535\nSo you're building on something\nthat is not pure self-interest.\n\n00:08:00.559 --> 00:08:04.536\nYou're building\non people's ideas and values --\n\n00:08:04.560 --> 00:08:10.227\nthat perhaps they're candles\nthat burn very dimly on certain occasions.\n\n00:08:10.688 --> 00:08:14.836\nBut it is a set of values that cannot,\nin my view, be extinguished.\n\n00:08:14.860 --> 00:08:16.415\nThen the question is,\n\n00:08:16.439 --> 00:08:19.097\nhow do you make that change happen?\n\n00:08:19.121 --> 00:08:23.009\nHow do you persuade people\nthat it is in their interest\n\n00:08:23.033 --> 00:08:24.772\nto build strong --\n\n00:08:24.796 --> 00:08:26.300\nAfter the Second World War,\n\n00:08:26.324 --> 00:08:29.301\nwe built institutions, the United Nations,\n\n00:08:29.325 --> 00:08:30.688\nthe IMF, the World Bank,\n\n00:08:30.712 --> 00:08:33.546\nthe World Trade Organization,\nthe Marshall Plan.\n\n00:08:33.570 --> 00:08:37.603\nThere was a period in which people\ntalked about an act of creation,\n\n00:08:37.627 --> 00:08:39.604\nbecause these institutions were so new.\n\n00:08:39.628 --> 00:08:42.739\nBut they are now out of date.\nThey don't deal with the problems.\n\n00:08:42.763 --> 00:08:44.898\nYou can't deal\nwith the environmental problem\n\n00:08:44.922 --> 00:08:46.397\nthrough existing institutions.\n\n00:08:46.421 --> 00:08:49.934\nYou can't deal with the security problem\nin the way that you need to.\n\n00:08:49.958 --> 00:08:52.530\nYou can't deal with the economic\nand financial problem.\n\n00:08:52.554 --> 00:08:54.934\nSo we have got to rebuild\nour global institutions,\n\n00:08:54.958 --> 00:08:58.177\nbuild them in a way that is suitable\nto the challenges of this time.\n\n00:08:58.201 --> 00:09:01.269\nAnd I believe that if you look\nat the biggest challenge we face,\n\n00:09:01.293 --> 00:09:03.935\nit is to persuade people\nto have the confidence\n\n00:09:03.959 --> 00:09:06.440\nthat we can build a truly global society\n\n00:09:06.464 --> 00:09:09.544\nwith the institutions\nthat are founded on these rules.\n\n00:09:09.568 --> 00:09:11.885\nSo, I come back to my initial point.\n\n00:09:11.909 --> 00:09:13.910\nSometimes you think things are impossible.\n\n00:09:13.934 -->

00:10:25.484\nSince then, the world has moved forward,\n\n00:10:25.508 --> 00:10:28.485\npartly as a result of what happened\nwith the Holocaust,\n\n00:10:28.509 --> 00:10:31.356\nand people's

00:14:23.585\nAnd I do believe\nthat there is a strong possibility\n\n00:14:23.609 --> 00:14:27.101\nthat if we work together, we can get\nthat agreement to Copenhagen.\n\n00:14:27.125 -->

we have taken into account\ntheir specific needs.\n\n00:14:36.288 --> 00:14:38.265\nAnd we would help them adapt.\n\n00:14:38.289 --> 00:14:42.006\nAnd we would help them make\nthe transition to a low-carbon economy.\n\n00:14:42.030 --> 00:14:45.792\nI do think a reform of the international\ninstitutions is vital to this.\n\n00:14:45.816 --> 00:14:48.117\nWhen the IMF was created in the 1940s,\n\n00:14:48.141 --> 00:14:51.809\nit was created with resources that were\nfive percent or so of the world's GDP.\n\n00:14:51.833 --> 00:14:54.143\nThe IMF now has limited\nresources, one percent.\n\n00:14:54.167 --> 00:14:55.866\nIt can't really make the difference\n\n00:14:55.890 --> 00:14:58.039\nthat ought to be made\nin a period of crisis.\n\n00:14:58.063 --> 00:15:00.934\nSo,

00:15:07.449\nwith the different voting shares\nin these institutions to do so.\n\n00:15:07.473 --> 00:15:10.657\nThere is a story told\nabout the three world leaders\n\n00:15:10.681 --> 00:15:14.811\nof the day getting a chance\nto get some advice from God.\n\n00:15:15.339 --> 00:15:19.338\nAnd the story is told\nthat Bill Clinton went to God\n\n00:15:19.362 --> 00:15:24.528\nand he asked when there will be\nsuccessful climate change\n\n00:15:24.552 --> 00:15:26.101\nand a low-carbon economy.\n\n00:15:26.125 --> 00:15:27.712\nAnd God shook his head and said,\n\n00:15:27.736 --> 00:15:31.855\n\"Not this year, not this decade,\nperhaps not even in [your] lifetime.\"\n\n00:15:31.879 --> 00:15:34.934\nAnd Bill Clinton walked away in tears\n\n00:15:34.958 --> 00:15:37.054\nbecause he had failed\nto get what he wanted.\n\n00:15:37.078 --> 00:15:40.703\nAnd then the story is that Barroso,\nthe president of the European Commission,\n\n00:15:40.727 --> 00:15:42.184\nwent to God and he asked,\n\n00:15:42.208 --> 00:15:46.553\n\"When will we get\na recovery of global growth?\"\n\n00:15:46.577 --> 00:15:48.912\nAnd God said, \"Not this year,\nnot in this decade,\n\n00:15:48.936 --> 00:15:50.555\nperhaps not in your lifetime.\"\n\n00:15:50.579 --> 00:15:53.357\nSo Barroso walked away\ncrying and in tears.\n\n00:15:54.335 --> 00:15:58.934\nAnd then the Secretary-General\nof the United Nations\n\n00:15:58.958 --> 00:16:01.422\ncame up to speak to God and said,\n\n00:16:01.446 --> 00:16:04.006\n\"When will our international\ninstitutions work?\"\n\n00:16:04.688 --> 00:16:05.881\nAnd God cried.\n\n00:16:05.905 --> 00:16:09.663\n(Laughter)\n\n00:16:09.687 --> 00:16:16.333\nIt is very important to recognize\nthat this reform of

"How do you observe something you can't see? This is the basic question of somebody who's interested in finding and studying black holes. Because black holes are objects whose pull of gravity is so intense that nothing can escape it, not even light, so you can't see it directly.So, my story today about black holes is about one particular black hole. I'm interested in finding whether or not there is a really massive, what we like to call \"supermassive\" black hole at the center of our galaxy. And the reason this is interesting is that it gives us an opportunity to prove whether or not these exotic objects really exist. And second, it gives us the opportunity to understand how these supermassive black holes interact with their environment, and to understand how they affect the formation and evolution of the galaxies which they reside in.So, to begin with, we need to understand what a black hole is so we can understand the proof of a black hole. So, what is a black hole? Well, in many ways a black hole is an incredibly simple object, because there are only three characteristics that you can describe: the mass, the spin, and the charge. And I'm going to only talk about the mass. So, in that sense, it's a very simple object. But in another sense, it's an incredibly complicated object that we need relatively exotic physics to describe, and in some sense represents the breakdown of our physical understanding of the universe.But today, the way I want you to understand a black hole, for the proof of a black hole, is to think of it as an object whose mass is confined to zero volume. So, despite the fact that I'm going to talk to you about an object that's supermassive, and I'm going to get to what that really means in a moment, it has no finite size. So, this is a little tricky.But fortunately there is a finite size that you can see, and that's known as the Schwarzschild radius. And that's named after the guy who recognized why it was such an important radius. This is a virtual radius, not reality; the black hole has no size. So why is it so important? It's important because it tells us that any object can become a black hole. That means you, your neighbor, your cellphone, the auditorium can become a black hole if you can figure out how to compress it down to the size of the Schwarzschild radius.At that point, what's going to happen? At that point gravity wins. Gravity wins over all other known forces. And the object is forced to continue to collapse to an infinitely small object. And then it's a black hole. So, if I were to compress the Earth down to the size of a sugar cube, it would become a black hole, because the size of a sugar cube is its Schwarzschild radius.Now, the key here is to figure out what that Schwarzschild radius is. And it turns out that it's actually pretty simple to figure out. It depends only on the mass of the object. Bigger objects have bigger Schwarzschild radii. Smaller objects have smaller Schwarzschild radii. So, if I were to take the sun and compress it down to the scale of the University of Oxford, it would become a black hole.So, now we know what a Schwarzschild radius is. And it's actually quite a useful concept, because it tells us not only when a black hole will form, but it also gives us the key elements for the proof of a black hole. I only need two things. I need to understand the mass of the object I'm claiming is a black hole, and what its Schwarzschild radius is. And since the mass determines the Schwarzschild radius, there is actually only one thing I really need to know.So, my job in convincing you that there is a black hole is to show that there is some object that's confined to within its Schwarzschild radius. And your job today is to be skeptical. Okay, so, I'm going to talk about no ordinary black hole; I'm going to talk about supermassive black holes.So, I wanted to say a few words about what an ordinary black hole is, as if there could be such a thing as an ordinary black hole. An ordinary black hole is thought to be the end state of a really massive star's life. So, if a star starts its life off with much more mass than the mass of the Sun, it's going to end its life by exploding and leaving behind these beautiful supernova remnants that we see here. And inside that supernova remnant is going to be a little black hole that has a mass roughly three times the mass of the Sun. On an astronomical scale that's a very small black hole.Now, what I want to talk about are the supermassive black holes. And the supermassive black holes are thought to reside at the center of galaxies. And this beautiful picture taken with the Hubble Space Telescope shows you that galaxies come in all shapes and sizes. There are big ones. There are little ones. Almost every object in that picture there is a galaxy. And there is a very nice spiral up in the upper left. And there are a hundred billion stars in that galaxy, just to give you a sense of scale. And all the light that we see from a typical galaxy, which is the kind of galaxies that we're seeing here, comes from the light from the stars. So, we see the galaxy because of the star light.Now, there are a few relatively exotic galaxies. I like to call these the prima donna of the galaxy world, because they are kind of show offs. And we call them active galactic nuclei. And we call them that because their nucleus, or their center, are very active. So, at the center there, that's actually where most of the starlight comes out from. And yet, what we actually see is light that can't be explained by the starlight. It's way more energetic. In fact, in a few examples it's like the ones that we're seeing here. There are also jets emanating out from the center. Again, a source of energy that's very difficult to explain if you just think that galaxies are composed of stars.So, what people have thought is that perhaps there are supermassive black holes which matter is falling on to. So, you can't see the black hole itself, but you can convert the gravitational energy of the black hole into the light we see. So, there is the thought that maybe supermassive black holes exist at the center of galaxies. But it's a kind of indirect argument.Nonetheless, it's given rise to the notion that maybe it's not just these prima donnas that have these supermassive black holes, but rather all galaxies might harbor these supermassive black holes at their centers. And if that's the case \u2014 and this is an example of a normal galaxy; what we see is the star light. And if there is a supermassive black hole, what we need to assume is that it's a black hole on a diet. Because that is the way to suppress the energetic phenomena that we see in active galactic nuclei.If we're going to look for these stealth black holes at the center of galaxies, the best place to look is in our own galaxy, our Milky Way. And this is a wide field picture taken of the center of the Milky Way. And what we see is a line of stars. And that is because we live in a galaxy which has a flattened, disk-like structure. And we live in the middle of it, so when we look towards the center, we see this plane which defines the plane of the galaxy, or line that defines the plane of the galaxy.Now, the advantage of studying our own galaxy is it's simply the closest example of the center of a galaxy that we're ever going to have, because the next closest galaxy is 100 times further away. So, we can see far more detail in our galaxy than anyplace else. And as you'll see in a moment, the ability to see detail is key to this experiment.So, how do astronomers prove that there is a lot of mass inside a small volume? Which is the job that I have to show you today. And the tool that we use is to watch the way stars orbit the black hole. Stars will orbit the black hole in the very same way that planets orbit the sun. It's the gravitational pull that makes these things orbit. If there were no massive objects these things would go flying off, or at least go at a much slower rate because all that determines how they go around is how much mass is inside its orbit.So, this is great, because remember my job is to show there is a lot of mass inside a small volume. So, if I know how fast it goes around, I know the mass. And if I know the scale of the orbit I know the radius. So, I want to see the stars that are as close to the center of the galaxy as possible. Because I want to show there is a mass inside as small a region as possible. So, this means that I want to see a lot of detail. And that's the reason that for this experiment we've used the world's largest telescope.This is the Keck observatory. It hosts two telescopes with a mirror 10 meters, which is roughly the diameter of a tennis court. Now, this is wonderful, because the campaign promise of large telescopes is that is that the bigger the telescope, the smaller the detail that we can see. But it turns out these telescopes, or any telescope on the ground has had a little bit of a challenge living up to this campaign promise. And that is because of the atmosphere. Atmosphere is great for us; it allows us to survive here on Earth. But it's relatively challenging for astronomers who want to look through the atmosphere to astronomical sources.So, to give you a sense of what this is like, it's actually like looking at a pebble at the bottom of a stream. Looking at the pebble on the bottom of the stream, the stream is continuously moving and turbulent, and that makes it very difficult to see the pebble on the bottom of the stream. Very much in the same way, it's very difficult to see astronomical sources, because of the atmosphere that's continuously moving by.So, I've spent a lot of my career working on ways to correct for the atmosphere, to give us a cleaner view. And that buys us about a factor of 20. And I think all of you can agree that if you can figure out how to improve life by a factor of 20, you've probably improved your lifestyle by a lot, say your salary, you'd notice, or your kids, you'd notice.And this animation here shows you one example of the techniques that we use, called adaptive optics. You're seeing an animation that goes between an example of what you would see if you don't use this technique \u2014 in other words, just a picture that shows the stars \u2014 and the box is centered on the center of the galaxy, where we think the black hole is. So, without this technology you can't see the stars. With this technology all of a sudden you can see it. This technology works by introducing a mirror into the telescope optics system that's continuously changing to counteract what the atmosphere is doing to you. So, it's kind of like very fancy eyeglasses for your telescope.Now, in the next few slides I'm just going to focus on that little square there. So, we're only going to look at the stars inside that small square, although we've looked at all of them. So, I want to see how these things have moved. And over the course of this experiment, these stars have moved a tremendous amount. So, we've been doing this experiment for 15 years, and we see the stars go all the way around.Now, most astronomers have a favorite star, and mine today is a star that's labeled up there, SO-2. Absolutely my favorite star in the world. And that's because it goes around in only 15 years. And to give you a sense of how short that is, the sun takes 200 million years to go around the center of the galaxy. Stars that we knew about before, that were as close to the center of the galaxy as possible, take 500 years. And this one, this one goes around in a human lifetime. That's kind of profound, in a way.But it's the key to this experiment. The orbit tells me how much mass is inside a very small radius. So, next we see a picture here that shows you before this experiment the size to which we could confine the mass of the center of the galaxy. What we knew before is that there was four million times the mass of the sun inside that circle. And as you can see, there was a lot of other stuff inside that circle. You can see a lot of stars. So, there was actually lots of alternatives to the idea that there was a supermassive black hole at the center of the galaxy, because you could put a lot of stuff in there.But with this experiment, we've confined that same mass to a much smaller volume that's 10,000 times smaller. And because of that, we've been able to show that there is a supermassive black hole there. To give you a sense of how small that size is, that's the size of our solar system. So, we're cramming four million times the mass of the sun into that small volume.Now, truth in advertising. Right? I have told you my job is to get it down to the Schwarzchild radius. And the truth is, I'm not quite there. But we actually have no alternative today to explaining this concentration of mass. And, in fact, it's the best evidence we have to date for not only existence of a supermassive black hole at the center of our own galaxy, but any in our universe. So, what next? I actually think this is about as good as we're going to do with today's technology, so let's move on with the problem.So, what I want to tell you, very briefly, is a few examples of the excitement of what we can do today at the center of the galaxy, now that we know that there is, or at least we believe, that there is a supermassive black hole there. And the fun phase of this experiment is, while we've tested some of our ideas about the consequences of a supermassive black hole being at the center of our galaxy, almost every single one has been inconsistent with what we actually see. And that's the fun.So, let me give you the two examples. You can ask, \"What do you expect for the old stars, stars that have been around the center of the galaxy for a long time, they've had plenty of time to interact with the black hole.\" What you expect there is that old stars should be very clustered around the black hole. You should see a lot of old stars next to that black hole.Likewise, for the young stars, or in contrast, the young stars, they just should not be there. A black hole does not make a kind neighbor to a stellar nursery. To get a star to form, you need a big ball of gas and dust to collapse. And it's a very fragile entity. And what does the big black hole do? It strips that gas cloud apart. It pulls much stronger on one side than the other and the cloud is stripped apart. In fact, we anticipated that star formation shouldn't proceed in that environment.So, you shouldn't see young stars. So, what do we see? Using observations that are not the ones I've shown you today, we can actually figure out which ones are old and which ones are young. The old ones are red. The young ones are blue. And the yellow ones, we don't know yet. So, you can already see the surprise. There is a dearth of old stars. There is an abundance of young stars, so it's the exact opposite of the prediction.So, this is the fun part. And in fact, today, this is what we're trying to figure out, this mystery of how do you get \u2014 how do you resolve this contradiction. So, in fact, my graduate students are, at this very moment, today, at the telescope, in Hawaii, making observations to get us hopefully to the next stage, where we can address this question of why are there so many young stars, and so few old stars. To make further progress we really need to look at the orbits of stars that are much further away. To do that we'll probably need much more sophisticated technology than we have today.Because, in truth, while I said we're correcting for the Earth's atmosphere, we actually only correct for half the errors that are introduced. We do this by shooting a laser up into the atmosphere, and what we think we can do is if we shine a few more that we can correct the rest. So this is what we hope to do in the next few years. And on a much longer time scale, what we hope to do is build even larger telescopes, because, remember, bigger is better in astronomy.So, we want to build a 30 meter telescope. And with this telescope we should be able to see stars that are even closer to the center of the galaxy. And we hope to be able to test some of Einstein's theories of general relativity, some ideas in cosmology about how galaxies form. So, we think the future of this experiment is quite exciting.So, in conclusion, I'm going to show you an animation that basically shows you how these orbits have been moving, in three dimensions. And I hope, if nothing else, I've convinced you that, one, we do in fact have a supermassive black hole at the center of the galaxy. And this means that these things do exist in our universe, and we have to contend with this, we have to explain how you can get these objects in our physical world.Second, we've been able to look at that interaction of how supermassive black holes interact, and understand, maybe, the role in which they play in shaping what galaxies are, and how they work.And last but not least, none of this would have happened without the advent of the tremendous progress that's been made on the technology front. And we think that this is a field that is moving incredibly fast, and holds a lot in store for the future. Thanks very much.

the black hole has no size.\n\n00:02:16.958 --> 00:02:18.958\nSo why is it so important?\n\n00:02:18.958 --> 00:02:20.958\nIt's important because it tells us\n\n00:02:20.958 --> 00:02:24.958\nthat any object can become a black hole.\n\n00:02:24.958 --> 00:02:27.958\nThat means you, your neighbor, your cellphone,\n\n00:02:27.958 --> 00:02:29.958\nthe auditorium can become a black hole\n\n00:02:29.958 --> 00:02:32.958\nif you can figure out how to compress it down\n\n00:02:32.958 --> 00:02:34.958\nto the size of the Schwarzschild radius.\n\n00:02:34.958 --> 00:02:37.958\nAt that point, what's going to happen?\n\n00:02:37.958 --> 00:02:39.958\nAt that point gravity wins.\n\n00:02:39.958 --> 00:02:41.958\nGravity wins over all other known forces.\n\n00:02:41.958 --> 00:02:44.958\nAnd the object is forced to continue to collapse\n\n00:02:44.958 --> 00:02:46.958\nto an infinitely small object.\n\n00:02:46.958 --> 00:02:48.958\nAnd then it's a black hole.\n\n00:02:48.958 --> 00:02:53.958\nSo, if I were to compress the Earth down to the size of a sugar cube,\n\n00:02:53.958 --> 00:02:55.958\nit would become a black hole,\n\n00:02:55.958 --> 00:02:59.958\nbecause the size of a sugar cube is its Schwarzschild radius.\n\n00:02:59.958 --> 00:03:02.958\nNow, the key here is to figure out what that Schwarzschild radius is.\n\n00:03:02.958 --> 00:03:06.958\nAnd it turns out that it's actually pretty simple to figure out.\n\n00:03:06.958 --> 00:03:08.958\nIt depends only on the mass of the object.\n\n00:03:08.958 --> 00:03:10.958\nBigger objects have bigger Schwarzschild radii.\n\n00:03:10.958 --> 00:03:13.958\nSmaller objects have smaller Schwarzschild radii.\n\n00:03:13.958 --> 00:03:15.958\nSo, if I were to take the sun\n\n00:03:15.958 --> 00:03:18.958\nand compress it down to the scale of the University of Oxford,\n\n00:03:18.958 --> 00:03:21.958\nit would become a black hole.\n\n00:03:21.958 --> 00:03:24.958\nSo, now we know what a Schwarzschild radius is.\n\n00:03:24.958 --> 00:03:26.958\nAnd it's actually quite a useful concept,\n\n00:03:26.958 --> 00:03:28.958\nbecause it tells us not only\n\n00:03:28.958 --> 00:03:30.958\nwhen a black hole will form,\n\n00:03:30.958 --> 00:03:33.958\nbut it also gives us the key elements for the proof of a black hole.\n\n00:03:33.958 --> 00:03:35.958\nI only need two things.\n\n00:03:35.958 --> 00:03:37.958\nI need to understand the mass of the object\n\n00:03:37.958 --> 00:03:39.958\nI'm claiming is a black hole,\n\n00:03:39.958 --> 00:03:41.958\nand what its Schwarzschild radius is.\n\n00:03:41.958 --> 00:03:43.958\nAnd since the mass determines the Schwarzschild radius,\n\n00:03:43.958 --> 00:03:45.958\nthere is actually only one thing I really need to know.\n\n00:03:45.958 --> 00:03:47.958\nSo, my job in convincing you\n\n00:03:47.958 --> 00:03:49.958\nthat there is a black hole\n\n00:03:49.958 --> 00:03:51.958\nis to show that there is some object\n\n00:03:51.958 --> 00:03:54.958\nthat's confined to within its Schwarzschild radius.\n\n00:03:54.958 --> 00:03:57.958\nAnd your job today is to be skeptical.\n\n00:03:57.958 --> 00:04:01.958\nOkay, so, I'm going to talk about no ordinary black hole;\n\n00:04:01.958 --> 00:04:04.958\nI'm going to talk about supermassive black holes.\n\n00:04:04.958 --> 00:04:06.958\nSo, I wanted to say a few words about what an ordinary black hole is,\n\n00:04:06.958 --> 00:04:09.958\nas if there could be such a thing as an ordinary black hole.\n\n00:04:09.958 --> 00:04:12.958\nAn ordinary black hole is thought to be the end state\n\n00:04:12.958 --> 00:04:14.958\nof a really massive star's life.\n\n00:04:14.958 --> 00:04:16.958\nSo, if a star starts its life off\n\n00:04:16.958 --> 00:04:18.958\nwith much more mass than the mass of the Sun,\n\n00:04:18.958 --> 00:04:21.958\nit's going to end its life by exploding\n\n00:04:21.958 --> 00:04:24.958\nand leaving behind these beautiful supernova remnants that we see here.\n\n00:04:24.958 --> 00:04:26.958\nAnd inside that supernova remnant\n\n00:04:26.958 --> 00:04:28.958\nis going to be a little black hole\n\n00:04:28.958 --> 00:04:31.958\nthat has a mass roughly three times the mass of the Sun.\n\n00:04:31.958 --> 00:04:33.958\nOn an astronomical scale\n\n00:04:33.958 --> 00:04:35.958\nthat's a very small black hole.\n\n00:04:35.958 --> 00:04:38.958\nNow, what I want to talk about are the supermassive black holes.\n\n00:04:38.958 --> 00:04:42.958\nAnd the supermassive black holes are thought to reside at the center of galaxies.\n\n00:04:42.958 --> 00:04:45.958\nAnd this beautiful picture taken with the Hubble Space Telescope\n\n00:04:45.958 --> 00:04:48.958\nshows you that galaxies come in all shapes and sizes.\n\n00:04:48.958 --> 00:04:50.958\nThere are big ones. There are little ones.\n\n00:04:50.958 --> 00:04:53.958\nAlmost every object in that picture there is a galaxy.\n\n00:04:53.958 --> 00:04:56.958\nAnd there is a very nice spiral up in the upper left.\n\n00:04:56.958 --> 00:05:00.958\nAnd there are a hundred billion stars in that galaxy,\n\n00:05:00.958 --> 00:05:02.958\njust to give you a sense of scale.\n\n00:05:02.958 --> 00:05:04.958\nAnd all the light that we see from a typical galaxy,\n\n00:05:04.958 --> 00:05:06.958\nwhich is the kind of galaxies that we're seeing here,\n\n00:05:06.958 --> 00:05:08.958\ncomes from the light from the stars.\n\n00:05:08.958 --> 00:05:10.958\nSo, we see the galaxy because of the star light.\n\n00:05:10.958 --> 00:05:14.958\nNow, there are a few relatively exotic galaxies.\n\n00:05:14.958 --> 00:05:17.958\nI like to call these the prima donna of the galaxy world,\n\n00:05:17.958 --> 00:05:19.958\nbecause they are kind of show offs.\n\n00:05:19.958 --> 00:05:21.958\nAnd we call them active galactic nuclei.\n\n00:05:21.958 --> 00:05:23.958\nAnd we call them that because their nucleus,\n\n00:05:23.958 --> 00:05:26.958\nor their center, are very active.\n\n00:05:26.958 --> 00:05:28.958\nSo, at the center there, that's actually where\n\n00:05:28.958 --> 00:05:30.958\nmost of the starlight comes out from.\n\n00:05:30.958 --> 00:05:32.958\nAnd yet, what we actually see is light\n\n00:05:32.958 --> 00:05:35.958\nthat can't be explained by the starlight.\n\n00:05:35.958 --> 00:05:37.958\nIt's way more energetic.\n\n00:05:37.958 --> 00:05:39.958\nIn fact, in a few examples it's like the ones that we're seeing here.\n\n00:05:39.958 --> 00:05:42.958\nThere are also jets emanating out from the center.\n\n00:05:42.958 --> 00:05:46.958\nAgain, a source of energy that's very difficult to explain\n\n00:05:46.958 --> 00:05:48.958\nif you just think that galaxies are composed of stars.\n\n00:05:48.958 --> 00:05:50.958\nSo, what people have thought is that perhaps\n\n00:05:50.958 --> 00:05:53.958\nthere are supermassive black holes\n\n00:05:53.958 --> 00:05:56.958\nwhich matter is falling on to.\n\n00:05:56.958 --> 00:05:58.958\nSo, you can't see the black hole itself,\n\n00:05:58.958 --> 00:06:01.958\nbut you can convert the gravitational energy of the black hole\n\n00:06:01.958 --> 00:06:03.958\ninto the light we see.\n\n00:06:03.958 --> 00:06:05.958\nSo, there is the thought that maybe supermassive black holes\n\n00:06:05.958 --> 00:06:07.958\nexist at the center of galaxies.\n\n00:06:07.958 --> 00:06:09.958\nBut it's a kind of indirect argument.\n\n00:06:09.958 --> 00:06:11.958\nNonetheless, it's given rise to the notion\n\n00:06:11.958 --> 00:06:14.958\nthat maybe it's not just these prima donnas\n\n00:06:14.958 --> 00:06:16.958\nthat have these supermassive black holes,\n\n00:06:16.958 --> 00:06:19.958\nbut rather all galaxies might harbor these\n\n00:06:19.958 --> 00:06:21.958\nsupermassive black holes at their centers.\n\n00:06:21.958 --> 00:06:24.958\nAnd if that's the case -- and this is an example of a normal galaxy;\n\n00:06:24.958 --> 00:06:26.958\nwhat we see is the star light.\n\n00:06:26.958 --> 00:06:28.958\nAnd if there is a supermassive black hole,\n\n00:06:28.958 --> 00:06:31.958\nwhat we need to assume is that it's a black hole on a diet.\n\n00:06:31.958 --> 00:06:34.958\nBecause that is the way to suppress the energetic phenomena that we see\n\n00:06:34.958 --> 00:06:37.958\nin active galactic nuclei.\n\n00:06:37.958 --> 00:06:40.958\nIf we're going to look for these stealth black holes\n\n00:06:40.958 --> 00:06:42.958\nat the center of galaxies,\n\n00:06:42.958 --> 00:06:46.958\nthe best place to look is in our own galaxy, our Milky Way.\n\n00:06:46.958 --> 00:06:48.958\nAnd this is a wide field picture\n\n00:06:48.958 --> 00:06:51.958\ntaken of the center of the Milky Way.\n\n00:06:51.958 --> 00:06:54.958\nAnd what we see is a line of stars.\n\n00:06:54.958 --> 00:06:56.958\nAnd that is because we live in a galaxy which has\n\n00:06:56.958 --> 00:06:58.958\na flattened, disk-like structure.\n\n00:06:58.958 --> 00:07:00.958\nAnd we live in the middle of it, so when we look towards the center,\n\n00:07:00.958 --> 00:07:02.958\nwe see this plane which defines the plane of the galaxy,\n\n00:07:02.958 --> 00:07:06.958\nor line that defines the plane of the galaxy.\n\n00:07:06.958 --> 00:07:09.958\nNow, the advantage of studying our own galaxy\n\n00:07:09.958 --> 00:07:12.958\nis it's simply the closest example of the center of a galaxy\n\n00:07:12.958 --> 00:07:14.958\nthat we're ever going to have, because the next closest galaxy\n\n00:07:14.958 --> 00:07:17.958\nis 100 times further away.\n\n00:07:17.958 --> 00:07:19.958\nSo, we can see far more detail in our galaxy\n\n00:07:19.958 --> 00:07:21.958\nthan anyplace else.\n\n00:07:21.958 --> 00:07:23.958\nAnd as you'll see in a moment, the ability to see detail\n\n00:07:23.958 --> 00:07:26.958\nis key to this experiment.\n\n00:07:26.958 --> 00:07:29.958\nSo, how do astronomers prove that there is a lot of mass\n\n00:07:29.958 --> 00:07:31.958\ninside a small volume?\n\n00:07:31.958 --> 00:07:34.958\nWhich is the job that I have to show you today.\n\n00:07:34.958 --> 00:07:36.958\nAnd the tool that we use is to watch the way\n\n00:07:36.958 --> 00:07:39.958\nstars orbit the black hole.\n\n00:07:39.958 --> 00:07:41.958\nStars will orbit the black hole\n\n00:07:41.958 --> 00:07:44.958\nin the very same way that planets orbit the sun.\n\n00:07:44.958 --> 00:07:46.958\nIt's the gravitational pull\n\n00:07:46.958 --> 00:07:48.958\nthat makes these things orbit.\n\n00:07:48.958 --> 00:07:51.958\nIf there were no massive objects these things would go flying off,\n\n00:07:51.958 --> 00:07:53.958\nor at least go at a much slower rate\n\n00:07:53.958 --> 00:07:56.958\nbecause all that determines how they go around\n\n00:07:56.958 --> 00:07:58.958\nis how much mass is inside its orbit.\n\n00:07:58.958 --> 00:08:00.958\nSo, this is great, because remember my job is to show\n\n00:08:00.958 --> 00:08:02.958\nthere is a lot of mass inside a small volume.\n\n00:08:02.958 --> 00:08:05.958\nSo, if I know how fast it goes around, I know the mass.\n\n00:08:05.958 --> 00:08:08.958\nAnd if I know the scale of the orbit I know the radius.\n\n00:08:08.958 --> 00:08:10.958\nSo, I want to see the stars\n\n00:08:10.958 --> 00:08:12.958\nthat are as close to the center of the galaxy as possible.\n\n00:08:12.958 --> 00:08:16.958\nBecause I want to show there is a mass inside as small a region as possible.\n\n00:08:16.958 --> 00:08:19.958\nSo, this means that I want to see a lot of detail.\n\n00:08:19.958 --> 00:08:21.958\nAnd that's the reason that for this experiment we've used\n\n00:08:21.958 --> 00:08:23.958\nthe world's largest telescope.\n\n00:08:23.958 --> 00:08:26.958\nThis is the Keck observatory. It hosts two telescopes\n\n00:08:26.958 --> 00:08:28.958\nwith a mirror 10 meters, which is roughly\n\n00:08:28.958 --> 00:08:30.958\nthe diameter of a tennis court.\n\n00:08:30.958 --> 00:08:32.958\nNow, this is wonderful,\n\n00:08:32.958 --> 00:08:34.958\nbecause the campaign promise\n\n00:08:34.958 --> 00:08:37.958\nof large telescopes is that is that the bigger the telescope,\n\n00:08:37.958 --> 00:08:41.958\nthe smaller the detail that we can see.\n\n00:08:41.958 --> 00:08:44.958\nBut it turns out these telescopes, or any telescope on the ground\n\n00:08:44.958 --> 00:08:48.958\nhas had a little bit of a challenge living up to this campaign promise.\n\n00:08:48.958 --> 00:08:50.958\nAnd that is because of the atmosphere.\n\n00:08:50.958 --> 00:08:52.958\nAtmosphere is great for us; it allows us\n\n00:08:52.958 --> 00:08:54.958\nto survive here on Earth.\n\n00:08:54.958 --> 00:08:57.958\nBut it's relatively challenging for astronomers\n\n00:08:57.958 --> 00:09:01.958\nwho want to look through the atmosphere to astronomical sources.\n\n00:09:01.958 --> 00:09:03.958\nSo, to give you a sense of what this is like,\n\n00:09:03.958 --> 00:09:05.958\nit's actually like looking at a pebble\n\n00:09:05.958 --> 00:09:07.958\nat the bottom of a stream.\n\n00:09:07.958 --> 00:09:09.958\nLooking at the pebble on the bottom of the stream,\n\n00:09:09.958 --> 00:09:12.958\nthe stream is continuously moving and turbulent,\n\n00:09:12.958 --> 00:09:16.958\nand that makes it very difficult to see the pebble on the bottom of the stream.\n\n00:09:16.958 --> 00:09:18.958\nVery much in the same way, it's very difficult\n\n00:09:18.958 --> 00:09:20.958\nto see astronomical sources, because of the\n\n00:09:20.958 --> 00:09:22.958\natmosphere that's continuously moving by.\n\n00:09:22.958 --> 00:09:25.958\nSo, I've spent a lot of my career working on ways\n\n00:09:25.958 --> 00:09:28.958\nto correct for the atmosphere, to give us a cleaner view.\n\n00:09:28.958 --> 00:09:31.958\nAnd that buys us about a factor of 20.\n\n00:09:31.958 --> 00:09:33.958\nAnd I think all of you can agree that if you can\n\n00:09:33.958 --> 00:09:36.958\nfigure out how to improve life by a factor of 20,\n\n00:09:36.958 --> 00:09:38.958\nyou've probably improved your lifestyle by a lot,\n\n00:09:38.958 --> 00:09:43.958\nsay your salary, you'd notice, or your kids, you'd notice.\n\n00:09:43.958 --> 00:09:45.958\nAnd this animation here shows you one example of\n\n00:09:45.958 --> 00:09:48.958\nthe techniques that we use, called adaptive optics.\n\n00:09:48.958 --> 00:09:50.958\nYou're seeing an animation that goes between\n\n00:09:50.958 --> 00:09:53.958\nan example of what you would see if you don't use this technique --\n\n00:09:53.958 --> 00:09:56.958\nin other words, just a picture that shows the stars --\n\n00:09:56.958 --> 00:09:58.958\nand the box is centered on the center of the galaxy,\n\n00:09:58.958 --> 00:10:00.958\nwhere we think the black hole is.\n\n00:10:00.958 --> 00:10:03.958\nSo, without this technology you can't see the stars.\n\n00:10:03.958 --> 00:10:05.958\nWith this technology all of a sudden you can see it.\n\n00:10:05.958 --> 00:10:07.958\nThis technology works by introducing a mirror\n\n00:10:07.958 --> 00:10:09.958\ninto the telescope optics system\n\n00:10:09.958 --> 00:10:14.958\nthat's continuously changing to counteract what the atmosphere is doing to you.\n\n00:10:14.958 --> 00:10:18.958\nSo, it's kind of like very fancy eyeglasses for your telescope.\n\n00:10:18.958 --> 00:10:20.958\nNow, in the next few slides I'm just going to focus on\n\n00:10:20.958 --> 00:10:22.958\nthat little square there.\n\n00:10:22.958 --> 00:10:24.958\nSo, we're only going to look at the stars inside that small square,\n\n00:10:24.958 --> 00:10:26.958\nalthough we've looked at all of them.\n\n00:10:26.958 --> 00:10:28.958\nSo, I want to see how these things have moved.\n\n00:10:28.958 --> 00:10:30.958\nAnd over the course of this experiment, these stars\n\n00:10:30.958 --> 00:10:32.958\nhave moved a tremendous amount.\n\n00:10:32.958 --> 00:10:34.958\nSo, we've been doing this experiment for 15 years,\n\n00:10:34.958 --> 00:10:36.958\nand we see the stars go all the way around.\n\n00:10:36.958 --> 00:10:39.958\nNow, most astronomers have a favorite star,\n\n00:10:39.958 --> 00:10:43.958\nand mine today is a star that's labeled up there, SO-2.\n\n00:10:43.958 --> 00:10:45.958\nAbsolutely my favorite star in the world.\n\n00:10:45.958 --> 00:10:48.958\nAnd that's because it goes around in only 15 years.\n\n00:10:48.958 --> 00:10:50.958\nAnd to give you a sense of how short that is,\n\n00:10:50.958 --> 00:10:55.958\nthe sun takes 200 million years to go around the center of the galaxy.\n\n00:10:55.958 --> 00:10:58.958\nStars that we knew about before, that were as close to the center of the galaxy\n\n00:10:58.958 --> 00:11:00.958\nas possible, take 500 years.\n\n00:11:00.958 --> 00:11:04.958\nAnd this one, this one goes around in a human lifetime.\n\n00:11:04.958 --> 00:11:06.958\nThat's kind of profound, in a way.\n\n00:11:06.958 --> 00:11:08.958\nBut it's the key to this experiment. The orbit tells me\n\n00:11:08.958 --> 00:11:12.958\nhow much mass is inside a very small radius.\n\n00:11:12.958 --> 00:11:15.958\nSo, next we see a picture here that shows you\n\n00:11:15.958 --> 00:11:17.958\nbefore this experiment the size to which we could\n\n00:11:17.958 --> 00:11:20.958\nconfine the mass of the center of the galaxy.\n\n00:11:20.958 --> 00:11:22.958\nWhat we knew before is that there was four million\n\n00:11:22.958 --> 00:11:25.958\ntimes the mass of the sun inside that circle.\n\n00:11:25.958 --> 00:11:27.958\nAnd as you can see, there was a lot of other stuff inside that circle.\n\n00:11:27.958 --> 00:11:29.958\nYou can see a lot of stars.\n\n00:11:29.958 --> 00:11:31.958\nSo, there was actually lots of alternatives\n\n00:11:31.958 --> 00:11:34.958\nto the idea that there was a supermassive black hole at the center of the galaxy,\n\n00:11:34.958 --> 00:11:36.958\nbecause you could put a lot of stuff in there.\n\n00:11:36.958 --> 00:11:38.958\nBut with this experiment, we've confined\n\n00:11:38.958 --> 00:11:41.958\nthat same mass to a much smaller volume\n\n00:11:41.958 --> 00:11:45.958\nthat's 10,000 times smaller.\n\n00:11:45.958 --> 00:11:47.958\nAnd because of that, we've been able to show\n\n00:11:47.958 --> 00:11:49.958\nthat there is a supermassive black hole there.\n\n00:11:49.958 --> 00:11:51.958\nTo give you a sense of how small that size is,\n\n00:11:51.958 --> 00:11:53.958\nthat's the size of our solar system.\n\n00:11:53.958 --> 00:11:57.958\nSo, we're cramming four million times the mass of the sun\n\n00:11:57.958 --> 00:11:59.958\ninto that small volume.\n\n00:11:59.958 --> 00:12:02.958\nNow, truth in advertising. Right?\n\n00:12:02.958 --> 00:12:05.958\nI have told you my job is to get it down to the Schwarzchild radius.\n\n00:12:05.958 --> 00:12:07.958\nAnd the truth is, I'm not quite there.\n\n00:12:07.958 --> 00:12:09.958\nBut we actually have no alternative today\n\n00:12:09.958 --> 00:12:12.958\nto explaining this concentration of mass.\n\n00:12:12.958 --> 00:12:15.958\nAnd, in fact, it's the best evidence we have to date\n\n00:12:15.958 --> 00:12:17.958\nfor not only existence of a supermassive black hole\n\n00:12:17.958 --> 00:12:20.958\nat the center of our own galaxy, but any in our universe.\n\n00:12:20.958 --> 00:12:23.958\nSo, what next? I actually think\n\n00:12:23.958 --> 00:12:25.958\nthis is about as good as we're going to do with today's technology,\n\n00:12:25.958 --> 00:12:27.958\nso let's move on with the problem.\n\n00:12:27.958 --> 00:12:29.958\nSo, what I want to tell you, very briefly,\n\n00:12:29.958 --> 00:12:31.958\nis a few examples\n\n00:12:31.958 --> 00:12:33.958\nof the excitement of what we can do today\n\n00:12:33.958 --> 00:12:35.958\nat the center of the galaxy, now that we know that there is,\n\n00:12:35.958 --> 00:12:37.958\nor at least we believe,\n\n00:12:37.958 --> 00:12:39.958\nthat there is a supermassive black hole there.\n\n00:12:39.958 --> 00:12:41.958\nAnd the fun phase of this experiment\n\n00:12:41.958 --> 00:12:44.958\nis, while we've tested some of our ideas\n\n00:12:44.958 --> 00:12:46.958\nabout the consequences of a supermassive black hole\n\n00:12:46.958 --> 00:12:48.958\nbeing at the center of our galaxy,\n\n00:12:48.958 --> 00:12:50.958\nalmost every single one\n\n00:12:50.958 --> 00:12:52.958\nhas been inconsistent with what we actually see.\n\n00:12:52.958 --> 00:12:54.958\nAnd that's the fun.\n\n00:12:54.958 --> 00:12:56.958\nSo, let me give you the two examples.\n\n00:12:56.958 --> 00:12:58.958\nYou can ask, \"What do you expect\n\n00:12:58.958 --> 00:13:00.958\nfor the old stars, stars that have been around the center of the galaxy\n\n00:13:00.958 --> 00:13:04.958\nfor a long time, they've had plenty of time to interact with the black hole.\"\n\n00:13:04.958 --> 00:13:06.958\nWhat you expect there is that old stars\n\n00:13:06.958 --> 00:13:08.958\nshould be very clustered around the black hole.\n\n00:13:08.958 --> 00:13:12.958\nYou should see a lot of old stars next to that black hole.\n\n00:13:12.958 --> 00:13:16.958\nLikewise, for the young stars, or in contrast, the young stars,\n\n00:13:16.958 --> 00:13:18.958\nthey just should not be there.\n\n00:13:18.958 --> 00:13:22.958\nA black hole does not make a kind neighbor to a stellar nursery.\n\n00:13:22.958 --> 00:13:26.958\nTo get a star to form, you need a big ball of gas and dust to collapse.\n\n00:13:26.958 --> 00:13:28.958\nAnd it's a very fragile entity.\n\n00:13:28.958 --> 00:13:30.958\nAnd what does the big black hole do?\n\n00:13:30.958 --> 00:13:32.958\nIt strips that gas cloud apart.\n\n00:13:32.958 --> 00:13:34.958\nIt pulls much stronger on one side than the other\n\n00:13:34.958 --> 00:13:36.958\nand the cloud is stripped apart.\n\n00:13:36.958 --> 00:13:39.958\nIn fact, we anticipated that star formation shouldn't proceed in that environment.\n\n00:13:39.958 --> 00:13:41.958\nSo, you shouldn't see young stars.\n\n00:13:41.958 --> 00:13:43.958\nSo, what do we see?\n\n00:13:43.958 --> 00:13:45.958\nUsing observations that are not the ones I've shown you today,\n\n00:13:45.958 --> 00:13:48.958\nwe can actually figure out which ones are old and which ones are young.\n\n00:13:48.958 --> 00:13:50.958\nThe old ones are red.\n\n00:13:50.958 --> 00:13:53.958\nThe young ones are blue. And the yellow ones, we don't know yet.\n\n00:13:53.958 --> 00:13:55.958\nSo, you can already see the surprise.\n\n00:13:55.958 --> 00:13:57.958\nThere is a dearth of old stars.\n\n00:13:57.958 --> 00:14:01.958\nThere is an abundance of young stars, so it's the exact opposite of the prediction.\n\n00:14:01.958 --> 00:14:03.958\nSo, this is the fun part.\n\n00:14:03.958 --> 00:14:05.958\nAnd in fact, today, this is what we're trying to figure out,\n\n00:14:05.958 --> 00:14:07.958\nthis mystery of how do you get --\n\n00:14:07.958 --> 00:14:09.958\nhow do you resolve this contradiction.\n\n00:14:09.958 --> 00:14:11.958\nSo, in fact, my graduate students\n\n00:14:11.958 --> 00:14:15.958\nare, at this very moment, today, at the telescope,\n\n00:14:15.958 --> 00:14:18.958\nin Hawaii, making observations to get us\n\n00:14:18.958 --> 00:14:20.958\nhopefully to the next stage,\n\n00:14:20.958 --> 00:14:22.958\nwhere we can address this question\n\n00:14:22.958 --> 00:14:24.958\nof why are there so many young stars,\n\n00:14:24.958 --> 00:14:26.958\nand so few old stars.\n\n00:14:26.958 --> 00:14:28.958\nTo make further progress we really need to look at the orbits\n\n00:14:28.958 --> 00:14:30.958\nof stars that are much further away.\n\n00:14:30.958 --> 00:14:32.958\nTo do that we'll probably need much more\n\n00:14:32.958 --> 00:14:34.958\nsophisticated technology than we have today.\n\n00:14:34.958 --> 00:14:36.958\nBecause, in truth, while I said we're correcting\n\n00:14:36.958 --> 00:14:38.958\nfor the Earth's atmosphere, we actually only\n\n00:14:38.958 --> 00:14:40.958\ncorrect for half the errors that are introduced.\n\n00:14:40.958 --> 00:14:43.958\nWe do this by shooting a laser up into the atmosphere,\n\n00:14:43.958 --> 00:14:46.958\nand what we think we can do is if we\n\n00:14:46.958 --> 00:14:48.958\nshine a few more that we can correct the rest.\n\n00:14:48.958 --> 00:14:50.958\nSo this is what we hope to do in the next few years.\n\n00:14:50.958 --> 00:14:52.958\nAnd on a much longer time scale,\n\n00:14:52.958 --> 00:14:55.958\nwhat we hope to do is build even larger telescopes,\n\n00:14:55.958 --> 00:14:58.958\nbecause, remember, bigger is better in astronomy.\n\n00:14:58.958 --> 00:15:00.958\nSo, we want to build a 30 meter telescope.\n\n00:15:00.958 --> 00:15:02.958\nAnd with this telescope we should be able to see\n\n00:15:02.958 --> 00:15:05.958\nstars that are even closer to the center of the galaxy.\n\n00:15:05.958 --> 00:15:07.958\nAnd we hope to be able to test some of\n\n00:15:07.958 --> 00:15:10.958\nEinstein's theories of general relativity,\n\n00:15:10.958 --> 00:15:13.958\nsome ideas in cosmology about how galaxies form.\n\n00:15:13.958 --> 00:15:15.958\nSo, we think the future of this experiment\n\n00:15:15.958 --> 00:15:18.958\nis quite exciting.\n\n00:15:18.958 --> 00:15:20.958\nSo, in conclusion, I'm going to show you an animation\n\n00:15:20.958 --> 00:15:22.958\nthat basically shows you how these\n\n00:15:22.958 --> 00:15:25.958\norbits have been moving, in three dimensions.\n\n00:15:25.958 --> 00:15:27.958\nAnd I hope, if nothing else,\n\n00:15:27.958 --> 00:15:29.958\nI've convinced you that, one, we do in fact\n\n00:15:29.958 --> 00:15:32.958\nhave a supermassive black hole at the center of the galaxy.\n\n00:15:32.958 --> 00:15:35.958\nAnd this means that these things do exist in our universe,\n\n00:15:35.958 --> 00:15:37.958\nand we have to contend with this, we have to explain\n\n00:15:37.958 --> 00:15:40.958\nhow you can get these objects in our physical world.\n\n00:15:40.958 --> 00:15:43.958\nSecond, we've been able to look at that interaction\n\n00:15:43.958 --> 00:15:46.958\nof how supermassive black holes interact,\n\n00:15:46.958 --> 00:15:50.958\nand understand, maybe, the role in which they play\n\n00:15:50.958 --> 00:15:53.958\nin shaping what galaxies are, and how they work.\n\n00:15:53.958 --> 00:15:55.958\nAnd last but not least,\n\n00:15:55.958 --> 00:15:57.958\nnone of this would have happened\n\n00:15:57.958 --> 00:16:00.958\nwithout the advent of the tremendous progress\n\n00:16:00.958 --> 00:16:02.958\nthat's been made on the technology front.\n\n00:16:02.958 --> 00:16:06.958\nAnd we think that this is a field that is moving incredibly fast,\n\n00:16:06.958 --> 00:16:09.958\nand holds a lot in store for the future.\n\n00:16:09.958 --> 00:16:11.958\nThanks very much.\n\n00:16:11.958 --> 00:16:16.958\n(Applause)"}, {"title": "The ancient ingenuity of water harvesting", "duration": "1034", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/anupam_mishra_the_ancient_ingenuity_of_water_harvesting", "transcript": "For emotions, we should not move quickly to the desert. So, first, a small housekeeping announcement: please switch off your proper English check programs installed in your brain. (Applause)So, welcome to the Golden Desert, Indian desert. It receives the least rainfall in the country, lowest rainfall. If you are well-versed with inches, nine inches, centimeters, 16 [centimeters]. The groundwater is 300 feet deep, 100 meters. And in most parts it is saline, not fit for drinking. So, you can't install hand pumps or dig wells, though there is no electricity in most of the villages. But suppose you use the green technology, solar pumps \u2014 they are of no use in this area.So, welcome to the Golden Desert. Clouds seldom visit this area. But we find 40 different names of clouds in this dialect used here. There are a number of techniques to harvest rain. This is a new work, it's a new program. But for the desert society this is no program; this is their life. And they harvest rain in many ways. So, this is the first device they use in harvesting rain. It's called kunds; somewhere it is called [unclear].And you can notice they have created a kind of false catchment. The desert is there, sand dunes, some small field. And this is all big raised platform. You can notice the small holes the water will fall on this catchment, and there is a slope. Sometimes our engineers and architects do not care about slopes in bathrooms, but here they will care properly. And the water will go where it should go. And then it is 40 feet deep. The waterproofing is done perfectly, better than our city contractors, because not a single drop should go waste in this.They collect 100 thousand liters in one season. And this is pure drinking water. Below the surface there is hard saline water. But now you can have this for year round. It's two houses. We often use a term called bylaws. Because we are used to get written things. But here it is unwritten by law. And people made their house, and the water storage tanks. These raised up platforms just like this stage. In fact they go 15 feet deep, and collect rain water from roof, there is a small pipe, and from their courtyard. It can also harvest something like 25,000 in a good monsoon.Another big one, this is of course out of the hardcore desert area. This is near Jaipur. This is called the Jaigarh Fort. And it can collect six million gallons of rainwater in one season. The age is 400 years. So, since 400 years it has been giving you almost six million gallons of water per season. You can calculate the price of that water. It draws water from 15 kilometers of canals.You can see a modern road, hardly 50 years old. It can break sometimes. But this 400 year old canal, which draws water, it is maintained for so many generations. Of course if you want to go inside, the two doors are locked. But they can be opened for TED people. (Laughter) And we request them. You can see person coming up with two canisters of water. And the water level \u2014 these are not empty canisters \u2014 water level is right up to this. It can envy many municipalities, the color, the taste, the purity of this water. And this is what they call Zero B type of water, because it comes from the clouds, pure distilled water.We stop for a quick commercial break, and then we come back to the traditional systems. The government thought that this is a very backward area and we should bring a multi-million dollar project to bring water from the Himalayas. That's why I said that this is a commercial break. (Laughter) But we will come back, once again, to the traditional thing. So, water from 300, 400 kilometers away, soon it become like this. In many portions, water hyacinth covered these big canals like anything.Of course there are some areas where water is reaching, I'm not saying that it is not reaching at all. But the tail end, the Jaisalmer area, you will notice in Bikaner things like this: where the water hyacinth couldn't grow, the sand is flowing in these canals. The bonus is that you can find wildlife around it. (Laughter)We had full-page advertisements, some 30 years, 25 years ago when this canal came. They said that throw away your traditional systems, these new cement tanks will supply you piped water. It's a dream. And it became a dream also. Because soon the water was not able to reach these areas. And people started renovating their own structures.These are all traditional water structures, which we won't be able to explain in such a short time. But you can see that no woman is standing on those. (Laughter) And they are plaiting hair. (Applause) Jaisalmer. This is heart of desert. This town was established 800 years ago. I'm not sure by that time Bombay was there, or Delhi was there, or Chennai was there, or Bangalore was there.So, this was the terminal point for silk route. Well connected, 800 years ago, through Europe. None of us were able to go to Europe, but Jaisalmer was well connected to it. And this is the 16 centimeter area. Such a limited rainfall, and highest colorful life flourished in these areas. You won't find water in this slide. But it is invisible. Somewhere a stream or a rivulet is running through here. Or, if you want to paint, you can paint it blue throughout because every roof which you see in this picture collects rainwater drops and deposit in the rooms.But apart from this system, they designed 52 beautiful water bodies around this town. And what we call private public partnership you can add estate also. So, estate, public and private entrepreneurs work together to build this beautiful water body. And it's a kind of water body for all seasons. You will admire it. Just behold the beauty throughout the year. Whether water level goes up or down, the beauty is there throughout.Another water body, dried up, of course, during the summer period, but you can see how the traditional society combines engineering with aesthetics, with the heart. These statues, marvelous statues, gives you an idea of water table. When this rain comes and the water starts filling this tank, it will submerge these beautiful statues in what we call in English today \"mass communication.\" This was for mass communication. Everybody in the town will know that this elephant has drowned, so water will be there for seven months or nine months, or 12 months. And then they will come and worship this pond, pay respect, their gratitude.Another small water body, called the [unclear]. It is difficult to translate in English, especially in my English. But the nearest would be \"glory,\" a reputation. The reputation in desert of this small water body is that it never dries up. In severe drought periods nobody has seen this water body getting dried up. And perhaps they knew the future also. It was designed some 150 years ago. But perhaps they knew that on sixth, November, 2009, there will be a TED green and blue session, so they painted it like this. (Laughter) (Applause)Dry water body. Children are standing on a very difficult device to explain. This is called kund. We have, in English, surface water and ground water. But this is not ground water. You can draw ground water from any well. But this is no ordinary well. It squeeze the moisture hidden in the sand. And they have dubbed this water as the third one called [unclear]. And there is a gypsum belt running below it. And it was deposited by the great mother Earth, some three million years ago. And where we have this gypsum strip they can harvest this water.This is the same dry water body. Now, you don't find any kund; they are all submerged. But when the water goes down they will be able to draw water from those structures throughout the year. This year they have received only six centimeters. Six centimeter of rainfall, and they can telephone you that if you find any water problem in your city, Delhi, Bombay, Bangalore, Mysore, please come to our area of six centimeters, we can give you water. (Laughter)How they maintain them? There are three things: concept, planning, making the actual thing, and also maintaining them. It is a structure for maintain, for centuries, by generations, without any department, without any funding, So the secret is \"[unclear],\" respect. Your own thing, not personal property, my property, every time.So, these stone pillars will remind you that you are entering into a water body area. Don't spit, don't do anything wrong, so that the clean water can be collected. Another pillar, stone pillar on your right side. If you climb these three, six steps you will find something very nice. This was done in 11th century. And you have to go further down. They say that a picture is worth a thousand words, so we can say a thousand words right now, an another thousand words. If the water table goes down, you will find new stairs. If it comes up, some of them will be submerged. So, throughout the year this beautiful system will give you some pleasure. Three sides, such steps, on the fourth side there is a four-story building where you can organize such TED conferences anytime. (Applause)Excuse me, who built these structures? They are in front of you. The best civil engineers we had, the best planners, the best architects. We can say that because of them, because of their forefathers, India could get the first engineering college in 1847. There were no English medium schools at that time, even no Hindi schools, [unclear] schools. But such people, compelled to the East India Company, which came here for business, a very dirty kind of business ... (Laughter) but not to create the engineering colleges. But because of them, first engineering college was created in a small village, not in the town.The last point, we all know in our primary schools that that camel is a ship of desert. So, you can find through your Jeep, a camel, and a cart. This tire comes from the airplane. So, look at the beauty from the desert society who can harvest rainwater, and also create something through a tire from a jet plane, and used in a camel cart.Last picture, it's a tattoo, 2,000-years-old tattoo. They were using it on their body. Tattoo was, at one time, a kind of a blacklisted or con thing, but now it is in thing. (Laughter) (Applause) You can copy this tattoo. I have some posters of this. (Laughter) The center of life is water. These are the beautiful waves. These are the beautiful stairs which we just saw in one of the slides. These are the trees. And these are the flowers which add fragrance to our lives. So, this is the message of desert. Thank you very much. (Applause)Chris Anderson: So, first of all, I wish I had your eloquence, truly, in any language. (Applause) These artifacts and designs are inspiring. Do you believe that they can be used elsewhere, that the world can learn from this? Or is this just right for this place?Anupam Mishra: No, the basic idea is to utilize water that falls on our area. So, the ponds, the open bodies, are everywhere, right from Sri Lanka to Kashmir, and in other parts also. And these [unclear], which stored water, there are two type of things. One recharge, and one stores. So, it depends on the terrain. But kund, which uses the gypsum belt, for that you have to go back to your calendar, three million years ago. If it is there it can be done right now. Otherwise, it can't be done. (Laughter) (Applause)CA: Thank you so much.

This is called the Jaigarh Fort.\n\n00:03:51.958 --> 00:03:57.958\nAnd it can collect six million gallons of rainwater in one season.\n\n00:03:57.958 --> 00:04:00.958\nThe age is 400 years.\n\n00:04:00.958 --> 00:04:04.958\nSo, since 400 years it has been giving you\n\n00:04:04.958 --> 00:04:09.958\nalmost six million gallons of water per season.\n\n00:04:09.958 --> 00:04:12.958\nYou can calculate the price of that water.\n\n00:04:12.958 --> 00:04:17.958\nIt draws water from 15 kilometers of canals.\n\n00:04:17.958 --> 00:04:22.958\nYou can see a modern road, hardly 50 years old.\n\n00:04:22.958 --> 00:04:25.958\nIt can break sometimes.\n\n00:04:25.958 --> 00:04:28.958\nBut this 400 year old canal, which draws water,\n\n00:04:28.958 --> 00:04:31.958\nit is maintained for so many generations.\n\n00:04:31.958 --> 00:04:35.958\nOf course if you want to go inside, the two doors are locked.\n\n00:04:35.958 --> 00:04:38.958\nBut they can be opened for TED people.\n\n00:04:38.958 --> 00:04:39.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:04:39.958 --> 00:04:41.958\nAnd we request them.\n\n00:04:41.958 --> 00:04:44.958\nYou can see person coming up with\n\n00:04:44.958 --> 00:04:46.958\ntwo canisters of water.\n\n00:04:46.958 --> 00:04:49.958\nAnd the water level -- these are not empty canisters --\n\n00:04:49.958 --> 00:04:52.958\nwater level is right up to this.\n\n00:04:52.958 --> 00:04:55.958\nIt can envy many municipalities,\n\n00:04:55.958 --> 00:05:00.958\nthe color, the taste, the purity of this water.\n\n00:05:00.958 --> 00:05:04.958\nAnd this is what they call Zero B type of water,\n\n00:05:04.958 --> 00:05:06.958\nbecause it comes from the clouds,\n\n00:05:06.958 --> 00:05:09.958\npure distilled water.\n\n00:05:09.958 --> 00:05:12.958\nWe stop for a quick commercial break,\n\n00:05:12.958 --> 00:05:15.958\nand then we come back to the traditional systems.\n\n00:05:15.958 --> 00:05:18.958\nThe government thought that this is a very\n\n00:05:18.958 --> 00:05:20.958\nbackward area and we should bring\n\n00:05:20.958 --> 00:05:23.958\na multi-million dollar project\n\n00:05:23.958 --> 00:05:26.958\nto bring water from the Himalayas.\n\n00:05:26.958 --> 00:05:29.958\nThat's why I said that this is a commercial break.\n\n00:05:29.958 --> 00:05:30.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:05:30.958 --> 00:05:32.958\nBut we will come back, once again,\n\n00:05:32.958 --> 00:05:34.958\nto the traditional thing.\n\n00:05:34.958 --> 00:05:38.958\nSo, water from 300, 400 kilometers away,\n\n00:05:38.958 --> 00:05:40.958\nsoon it become like this.\n\n00:05:40.958 --> 00:05:42.958\nIn many portions, water hyacinth\n\n00:05:42.958 --> 00:05:47.958\ncovered these big canals like anything.\n\n00:05:47.958 --> 00:05:49.958\nOf course there are some areas where water is reaching,\n\n00:05:49.958 --> 00:05:52.958\nI'm not saying that it is not reaching at all.\n\n00:05:52.958 --> 00:05:56.958\nBut the tail end, the Jaisalmer area,\n\n00:05:56.958 --> 00:05:59.958\nyou will notice in Bikaner things like this:\n\n00:05:59.958 --> 00:06:01.958\nwhere the water hyacinth couldn't grow,\n\n00:06:01.958 --> 00:06:06.958\nthe sand is flowing in these canals.\n\n00:06:06.958 --> 00:06:10.958\nThe bonus is that you can find wildlife around it.\n\n00:06:10.958 --> 00:06:13.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:06:13.958 --> 00:06:16.958\nWe had full-page advertisements,\n\n00:06:16.958 --> 00:06:20.958\nsome 30 years, 25 years ago when this canal came.\n\n00:06:20.958 --> 00:06:24.958\nThey said that throw away your traditional systems,\n\n00:06:24.958 --> 00:06:28.958\nthese new cement tanks will supply you piped water.\n\n00:06:28.958 --> 00:06:32.958\nIt's a dream. And it became a dream also.\n\n00:06:32.958 --> 00:06:39.958\nBecause soon the water was not able to reach these areas.\n\n00:06:39.958 --> 00:06:44.958\nAnd people started renovating their own structures.\n\n00:06:44.958 --> 00:06:47.958\nThese are all traditional water structures,\n\n00:06:47.958 --> 00:06:51.958\nwhich we won't be able to explain in such a short time.\n\n00:06:51.958 --> 00:06:55.958\nBut you can see that no woman is standing on those.\n\n00:06:55.958 --> 00:06:56.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:06:56.958 --> 00:06:58.958\nAnd they are plaiting hair.\n\n00:06:58.958 --> 00:07:02.958\n(Applause)\n\n00:07:02.958 --> 00:07:05.958\nJaisalmer. This is heart of desert.\n\n00:07:05.958 --> 00:07:09.958\nThis town was established 800 years ago.\n\n00:07:09.958 --> 00:07:12.958\nI'm not sure by that time\n\n00:07:12.958 --> 00:07:14.958\nBombay was there, or Delhi was there,\n\n00:07:14.958 --> 00:07:17.958\nor Chennai was there, or Bangalore was there.\n\n00:07:17.958 --> 00:07:20.958\nSo, this was the terminal point for silk route.\n\n00:07:20.958 --> 00:07:25.958\nWell connected, 800 years ago, through Europe.\n\n00:07:25.958 --> 00:07:29.958\nNone of us were able to go to Europe,\n\n00:07:29.958 --> 00:07:32.958\nbut Jaisalmer was well connected to it.\n\n00:07:32.958 --> 00:07:36.958\nAnd this is the 16 centimeter area.\n\n00:07:36.958 --> 00:07:39.958\nSuch a limited rainfall,\n\n00:07:39.958 --> 00:07:45.958\nand highest colorful life flourished in these areas.\n\n00:07:45.958 --> 00:07:48.958\nYou won't find water in this slide.\n\n00:07:48.958 --> 00:07:50.958\nBut it is invisible.\n\n00:07:50.958 --> 00:07:54.958\nSomewhere a stream or a rivulet\n\n00:07:54.958 --> 00:07:57.958\nis running through here.\n\n00:07:57.958 --> 00:08:01.958\nOr, if you want to paint, you can paint it blue throughout\n\n00:08:01.958 --> 00:08:05.958\nbecause every roof which you see in this picture\n\n00:08:05.958 --> 00:08:07.958\ncollects rainwater drops\n\n00:08:07.958 --> 00:08:12.958\nand deposit in the rooms.\n\n00:08:12.958 --> 00:08:15.958\nBut apart from this system,\n\n00:08:15.958 --> 00:08:21.958\nthey designed 52 beautiful water bodies around this town.\n\n00:08:21.958 --> 00:08:25.958\nAnd what we call private public partnership\n\n00:08:25.958 --> 00:08:28.958\nyou can add estate also.\n\n00:08:28.958 --> 00:08:32.958\nSo, estate, public and private entrepreneurs\n\n00:08:32.958 --> 00:08:36.958\nwork together to build this beautiful water body.\n\n00:08:36.958 --> 00:08:41.958\nAnd it's a kind of water body for all seasons.\n\n00:08:41.958 --> 00:08:45.958\nYou will admire it.

those structures throughout the year.\n\n00:11:27.958 --> 00:11:31.958\nThis year they have received only six centimeters.\n\n00:11:31.958 --> 00:11:34.958\nSix centimeter of rainfall,\n\n00:11:34.958 --> 00:11:36.958\nand they can telephone you\n\n00:11:36.958 --> 00:11:39.958\nthat if you find any water problem in your city,\n\n00:11:39.958 --> 00:11:41.958\nDelhi, Bombay, Bangalore, Mysore,\n\n00:11:41.958 --> 00:11:45.958\nplease come to our area of six centimeters, we can give you water.\n\n00:11:45.958 --> 00:11:46.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:11:46.958 --> 00:11:48.958\nHow they maintain them?\n\n00:11:48.958 --> 00:11:51.958\nThere are three things: concept, planning,\n\n00:11:51.958 --> 00:11:54.958\nmaking the actual thing, and also maintaining them.\n\n00:11:54.958 --> 00:11:56.958\nIt is a structure for maintain,\n\n00:11:56.958 --> 00:12:01.958\nfor centuries, by generations, without any department,\n\n00:12:01.958 --> 00:12:03.958\nwithout any funding,\n\n00:12:03.958 --> 00:12:08.958\nSo the secret is \"[unclear],\" respect.\n\n00:12:08.958 --> 00:12:12.958\nYour own thing, not personal property,\n\n00:12:12.958 --> 00:12:15.958\nmy property, every time.\n\n00:12:15.958 --> 00:12:17.958\nSo, these stone pillars\n\n00:12:17.958 --> 00:12:21.958\nwill remind you that you are entering into a water body area.\n\n00:12:21.958 --> 00:12:23.958\nDon't spit, don't do anything wrong,\n\n00:12:23.958 --> 00:12:26.958\nso that the clean water can be collected.\n\n00:12:26.958 --> 00:12:29.958\nAnother pillar, stone pillar on your right side.\n\n00:12:29.958 --> 00:12:32.958\nIf you climb these three, six steps\n\n00:12:32.958 --> 00:12:35.958\nyou will find something very nice.\n\n00:12:35.958 --> 00:12:38.958\nThis was done in 11th century.\n\n00:12:38.958 --> 00:12:41.958\nAnd you have to go further down.\n\n00:12:41.958 --> 00:12:44.958\nThey say that a picture is worth a thousand words,\n\n00:12:44.958 --> 00:12:47.958\nso we can say a thousand words right now,\n\n00:12:47.958 --> 00:12:49.958\nan another thousand words.\n\n00:12:49.958 --> 00:12:51.958\nIf the water table goes down,\n\n00:12:51.958 --> 00:12:53.958\nyou will find new stairs.\n\n00:12:53.958 --> 00:12:57.958\nIf it comes up, some of them will be submerged.\n\n00:12:57.958 --> 00:12:59.958\nSo, throughout the year\n\n00:12:59.958 --> 00:13:04.958\nthis beautiful system will give you some pleasure.\n\n00:13:04.958 --> 00:13:06.958\nThree sides, such steps, on the fourth side\n\n00:13:06.958 --> 00:13:08.958\nthere is a four-story building\n\n00:13:08.958 --> 00:13:13.958\nwhere you can organize such TED conferences anytime.\n\n00:13:13.958 --> 00:13:19.958\n(Applause)\n\n00:13:19.958 --> 00:13:23.958\nExcuse me, who built these structures?\n\n00:13:23.958 --> 00:13:25.958\nThey are in front of you.\n\n00:13:25.958 --> 00:13:29.958\nThe best civil engineers we had, the best planners,\n\n00:13:29.958 --> 00:13:31.958\nthe best architects.\n\n00:13:31.958 --> 00:13:33.958\nWe can say that because of them,\n\n00:13:33.958 --> 00:13:35.958\nbecause of their forefathers,\n\n00:13:35.958 --> 00:13:38.958\nIndia could get the first engineering college\n\n00:13:38.958 --> 00:13:41.958\nin 1847.\n\n00:13:41.958 --> 00:13:44.958\nThere were no English medium schools at that time,\n\n00:13:44.958 --> 00:13:47.958\neven no Hindi schools, [unclear] schools.\n\n00:13:47.958 --> 00:13:50.958\nBut such people, compelled to the East India Company,\n\n00:13:50.958 --> 00:13:54.958\nwhich came here for business, a very dirty kind of business ...\n\n00:13:54.958 --> 00:13:56.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:13:56.958 --> 00:13:59.958\nbut not to create the engineering colleges.\n\n00:13:59.958 --> 00:14:03.958\nBut because of them, first engineering college was created\n\n00:14:03.958 --> 00:14:06.958\nin a small village, not in the town.\n\n00:14:06.958 --> 00:14:11.958\nThe last point, we all know in our primary schools that\n\n00:14:11.958 --> 00:14:14.958\nthat camel is a ship of desert.\n\n00:14:14.958 --> 00:14:17.958\nSo, you can find through your Jeep,\n\n00:14:17.958 --> 00:14:20.958\na camel, and a cart.\n\n00:14:20.958 --> 00:14:24.958\nThis tire comes from the airplane.\n\n00:14:24.958 --> 00:14:27.958\nSo, look at the beauty from the desert society\n\n00:14:27.958 --> 00:14:29.958\nwho can harvest rainwater,\n\n00:14:29.958 --> 00:14:32.958\nand also create something\n\n00:14:32.958 --> 00:14:36.958\nthrough a tire from a jet plane,\n\n00:14:36.958 --> 00:14:38.958\nand used in a camel cart.\n\n00:14:38.958 --> 00:14:41.958\nLast picture, it's a tattoo,\n\n00:14:41.958 --> 00:14:43.958\n2,000-years-old tattoo.\n\n00:14:43.958 --> 00:14:46.958\nThey were using it on their body.\n\n00:14:46.958 --> 00:14:48.958\nTattoo was, at one time,\n\n00:14:48.958 --> 00:14:50.958\na kind of a blacklisted\n\n00:14:50.958 --> 00:14:53.958\nor con thing, but now it is in thing.\n\n00:14:53.958 --> 00:14:55.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:14:55.958 --> 00:14:57.958\n(Applause)\n\n00:14:57.958 --> 00:15:00.958\nYou can copy this tattoo. I have some posters of this.\n\n00:15:00.958 --> 00:15:03.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:15:03.958 --> 00:15:08.958\nThe center of life is water.\n\n00:15:08.958 --> 00:15:10.958\nThese are the beautiful waves.\n\n00:15:10.958 --> 00:15:13.958\nThese are the beautiful stairs\n\n00:15:13.958 --> 00:15:16.958\nwhich we just saw in one of the slides.\n\n00:15:16.958 --> 00:15:19.958\nThese are the trees.\n\n00:15:19.958 --> 00:15:21.958\nAnd these are the flowers which\n\n00:15:21.958 --> 00:15:25.958\nadd fragrance to our lives.\n\n00:15:25.958 --> 00:15:28.958\nSo, this is the message of desert.\n\n00:15:28.958 --> 00:15:30.958\nThank you very much.\n\n00:15:30.958 --> 00:15:56.958\n(Applause)\n\n00:15:56.958 --> 00:16:00.958\nChris Anderson: So, first of all, I wish I had your eloquence, truly, in any language.\n\n00:16:00.958 --> 00:16:07.958\n(Applause)\n\n00:16:07.958 --> 00:16:13.958\nThese artifacts and designs are inspiring.\n\n00:16:13.958 --> 00:16:16.958\nDo you believe that they can be used elsewhere,\n\n00:16:16.958 --> 00:16:18.958\nthat the world can learn from this?\n\n00:16:18.958 --> 00:16:20.958\nOr is this just right for this place?\n\n00:16:20.958 --> 00:16:23.958\nAnupam Mishra: No, the basic idea is to\n\n00:16:23.958 --> 00:16:26.958\nutilize water that falls on our area.\n\n00:16:26.958 --> 00:16:30.958\nSo, the ponds, the open bodies, are everywhere,\n\n00:16:30.958 --> 00:16:35.958\nright from Sri Lanka to Kashmir, and in other parts also.\n\n00:16:35.958 --> 00:16:38.958\nAnd these [unclear], which stored water,\n\n00:16:38.958 --> 00:16:40.958\nthere are two type of things.\n\n00:16:40.958 --> 00:16:42.958\nOne recharge, and one stores.\n\n00:16:42.958 --> 00:16:45.958\nSo, it depends on the terrain.\n\n00:16:45.958 --> 00:16:48.958\nBut kund, which uses the gypsum belt,\n\n00:16:48.958 --> 00:16:52.958\nfor that you have to go back to your calendar,\n\n00:16:52.958 --> 00:16:54.958\nthree million years ago.\n\n00:16:54.958 --> 00:16:56.958\nIf it is there it can be done right now.\n\n00:16:56.958 --> 00:16:58.958\nOtherwise, it can't be done.\n\n00:16:58.958 --> 00:16:59.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:16:59.958 --> 00:17:01.958\n(Applause)\n\n00:17:01.958 --> 00:17:03.958\nCA: Thank you so much.\n\n00:17:03.958 --> 00:17:05.958\n(Applause)"}, {"title": "The art of puzzles", "duration": "709", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/scott_kim_takes_apart_the_art_of_puzzles", "transcript": "For the last 20 years I've been designing puzzles. And I'm here today to give you a little tour, starting from the very first puzzle I designed, through what I'm doing now. I've designed puzzles for books, printed things. I'm the puzzle columnist for Discover Magazine. I've been doing that for about 10 years. I have a monthly puzzle calendar. I do toys. The bulk of my work is in computer games. I did puzzles for \"Bejeweled.\" (Applause) I didn't invent \"Bejeweled.\" I can't take credit for that.So, very first puzzle, sixth grade, my teacher said, \"Oh, let's see, that guy, he likes to make stuff. I'll have him cut out letters out of construction paper for the board.\" I thought this was a great assignment. And so here is what I came up with. I start fiddling with it. I came up with this letter. This is a letter of the alphabet that's been folded just once. The question is, which letter is it if I unfold it? One hint: It's not \"L.\" (Laughter) It could be an \"L,\" of course. So, what else could it be? Yeah, a lot of you got it. Oh yeah. So, clever thing.Now, that was my first puzzle. I got hooked. I created something new, I was very excited because, you know, I'd made crossword puzzles, but that's sort of like filling in somebody else's matrix. This was something really original. I got hooked. I read Martin Gardner's columns in Scientific American. Went on, and eventually decided to devote myself, full time, to that.Now, I should pause and say, what do I mean by puzzle? A puzzle is a problem that is fun to solve and has a right answer. \"Fun to solve,\" as opposed to everyday problems, which, frankly, are not very well-designed puzzles. You know, they might have a solution. It might take a long time. Nobody wrote down the rules clearly. Who designed this? It's like, you know, life is not a very well-written story so we have to hire writers to make movies.Well, I take everyday problems, and I make puzzles out of them. And \"right answer,\" of course there might be more than one right answer; many puzzles have more than one. But as opposed to a couple other forms of play, toys and games \u2014 by toy I mean, something you play with that doesn't have a particular goal. You can create one out of Legos. You know, you can do anything you want. Or competitive games like chess where, well, you're not trying to solve ... You can make a chess puzzle, but the goal really is to beat another player.I consider that puzzles are an art form. They're very ancient. It goes back as long as there is written history. It's a very small form, like a joke, a poem, a magic trick or a song, very compact form. At worst, they're throwaways, they're for amusement. But at best they can reach for something more and create a memorable impression. The progression of my career that you'll see is looking for creating puzzles that have a memorable impact.So, one thing I found early on, when I started doing computer games, is that I could create puzzles that will alter your perception. I'll show you how. Here is a famous one. So, it's two profiles in black, or a white vase in the middle. This is called a figure-ground illusion. The artist M.C. Escher exploited that in some of his wonderful prints. Here we have \"Day and Night.\" Here is what I did with figure and ground. So, here we have \"figure\" in black. Here we have \"figure\" in white. And it's all part of the same design. The background to one is the other. Originally I tried to do the words \"figure\" and \"ground.\" But I couldn't do that, I realized. I changed the problem. It's all \"figure.\" (Laughter)A few other things. Here is my name. And that turns into the title of my first book, \"Inversions.\" These sorts of designs now go by the word \"ambigram.\" I'll show you just a couple others. Here we have the numbers one through 10, the digits zero through nine, actually. Each letter here is one of these digits. Not strictly an ambigram in the conventional sense. I like pushing on what an ambigram can mean.Here's the word \"mirror.\" No, it's not the same upside-down. It's the same this way. And a marvelous fellow from the Media Lab who just got appointed head of RISD, is John Maeda. And so I did this for him. It's sort of a visual canon. (Laughter) And recently in Magic magazine I've done a number of ambigrams on magician's names. So here we have Penn and Teller, same upside-down. This appears in my puzzle calendar. Okay, let's go back to the slides. Thank you very much.Now, those are fun to look at. Now how would you do it interactively? For a while I was an interface designer. And so I think a lot about interaction. Well, let's first of all simplify the vases illusion, make the thing on the right. Now, if you could pick up the black vase, it would look like the figure on top. If you could pick up the white area, it would look like the figure on the bottom. Well, you can't do that physically, but on a computer you can do it. Let's switch over to the P.C.And here it is, figure-ground. The goal here is to take the pieces on the left and make them so they look like the shape on the right. And this follows the rules I just said: any black area that is surrounded by white can be picked up. But that is also true of any white area. So, here we got the white area in the middle, and you can pick it up. I'll just go one step further. So, here is \u2014 here is a couple pieces. Move them together, and now this is an active piece. You can really get inside somebody's perception and have them experience something. It's like the old maxim of \"you can tell somebody something and show them, but if they do it they really learn it.\"Here is another thing you can do. There is a game called Rush Hour. This is one of the true masterpieces in puzzle design besides Rubik's cube. So, here we have a crowded parking lot with cars all over the place. The goal is to get the red car out. It's a sliding block puzzle. It's made by the company Think Fun. It's done very well. I love this puzzle.Well, let's play one. Here. So, here is a very simple puzzle. Well, that's too simple, let's add another piece. Okay, so how would you solve this one? Well, move the blue one out of the way. Here, let's make it a little harder. Still pretty easy. Now we'll make it harder, a little harder. Now, this one is a little bit trickier. You know? What do you do here? The first move is going to be what? You're going to move the blue one up in order to get the lavender one to the right. And you can make puzzles like this one that aren't solvable at all. Those four are locked in a pinwheel; you can't get them apart.I wanted to make a sequel. I didn't come up with the original idea. But this is another way I work as an inventor is to create a sequel. I came up with this. This is Railroad Rush Hour. It's the same basic game except I introduced a new piece, a square piece that can move both horizontally and vertically. In the other game the cars can only move forward and back. Created a whole bunch of levels for it. Now I'm making it available to schools. And it includes exercises that show you not just how to solve these puzzles, but how to extract the principles that will let you solve mathematical puzzles or problems in science, other areas.So, I'm really interested in you learning how to make your own puzzles as well as just me creating them. Garry Trudeau calls himself an investigative cartoonist. You know, he does a lot of research before he writes a cartoon. In Discover Magazine, I'm an investigative puzzle maker. I got interested in gene sequencing. And I said, \"Well, how on Earth can you come up with a sequence of the base pairs in DNA?\" Cut up the DNA, you sequence individual pieces, and then you look for overlaps, and you basically match them at the edges. And I said, \"This is kind of like a jigsaw puzzle, except the pieces overlap.\"So, here is what I created for Discover Magazine. And it has to be solvable in a magazine. You know, you can't cut out the pieces and move them around. So, here is the nine pieces. And you're supposed to put them into this grid. And you have to choose pieces that overlap on the edge. There is only one solution. It's not that hard. But it takes some persistence. And when you're done, it makes this design, which, if you squint, is the word \"helix.\" So, that's the form of the puzzle coming out of the content, rather than the other way around.Here is a couple more. Here is a physics-based puzzle. Which way will these fall? One of these weighs 50 pounds, 30 pounds and 10 pounds. And depending on which one weighs which amount, they'll fall different directions. And here is a puzzle based on color mixing. I separated this image into cyan, magenta, yellow, black, the basic printing colors, and then mixed up the separations, and you get these peculiar pictures. Which separations were mixed up to make those pictures? Gets you thinking about color.Finally, what I'm doing now. So, ShuffleBrain.com, website you can go visit, I joined up with my wife, Amy-Jo Kim. She could easily be up here giving a talk about her work. So, we're making smart games for social media. I'll explain what that means. We're looking at three trends. This is what's going on in the games industry right now. First of all, you know, for a long time computer games meant things like \"Doom,\" where you're going around shooting things, very violent games, very fast, aimed at teenage boys. Right? That's who plays computer games.Well, guess what? That's changing. \"Bejeweled\" is a big hit. It was the game that really broke open what's called casual games. And the main players are over 35, and are female. Then recently \"Rock Band\" has been a big hit. And it's a game you play with other people. It's very physical. It looks nothing like a traditional game. This is what's becoming the dominant form of electronic gaming.Now, within that there is some interesting things happening. There is also a trend towards games that are good for you. Why? Well, we aging Boomers, Baby Boomers, we're eating our healthy food, we're exercising. What about our minds? Oh no, our parents are getting Alzheimer's. We better do something. Turns out doing crossword puzzles can stave off some of the effects of Alzheimer's. So, we got games like \"Brain Age\" coming out for the Nintendo DS, huge hit. A lot of people do Sudoku. In fact some doctors prescribe it.And then there is social media, and what's happening on the Internet. Everybody now considers themselves a creator, and not just a viewer. And what does this add up to? Here is what we see coming. It's games that fit into a healthy lifestyle. They're part of your life. They're not necessarily a separate thing. And they are both, something that is good for you, and they're fun. I'm a puzzle guy. My wife is an expert in social media. And we decided to combine our skills.Our first game is called \"Photo Grab.\" The game takes about a minute and 20 seconds. This is your first time playing my game. Okay. Let's see how well we can do. There are three images. And we have 24 seconds each. Where is that? I'll play as fast as I can. But if you can see it, shout out the answer. You get more \u2014 Down, okay, yeah where is that? Oh, yeah. There, okay. J-O and \u2014 I guess that's that part. We got the bow. That bow helps. That's his hair. You get a lot of figure-ground problems. Yeah, that one is easy. Okay. So, ahhh! Okay on to the next one. Okay, so that's the lens. Anybody? Looks like a black shape. So, where is that? That's the corner of the whole thing. Yeah, I've played this image before, but even when I make up my own puzzles \u2014 and you can put your own images in here.

The bulk of my work is in computer games.\n\n00:00:36.958 --> 00:00:38.958\nI did puzzles for \"Bejeweled.\"\n\n00:00:38.958 --> 00:00:39.958\n(Applause)\n\n00:00:39.958 --> 00:00:41.958\nI didn't invent \"Bejeweled.\" I can't take credit for that.\n\n00:00:41.958 --> 00:00:44.958\nSo, very first puzzle,\n\n00:00:44.958 --> 00:00:46.958\nsixth grade, my teacher said,\n\n00:00:46.958 --> 00:00:48.958\n\"Oh, let's see, that guy, he likes to make stuff.\n\n00:00:48.958 --> 00:00:51.958\nI'll have him cut out letters out of construction paper\n\n00:00:51.958 --> 00:00:54.958\nfor the board.\"\n\n00:00:54.958 --> 00:00:56.958\nI thought this was a great assignment.\n\n00:00:56.958 --> 00:00:59.958\nAnd so here is what I came up with. I start fiddling with it.\n\n00:00:59.958 --> 00:01:02.958\nI came up with this letter. This is a letter of the alphabet\n\n00:01:02.958 --> 00:01:04.958\nthat's been folded just once.\n\n00:01:04.958 --> 00:01:09.958\nThe question is, which letter is it if I unfold it?\n\n00:01:09.958 --> 00:01:11.958\nOne hint: It's not \"L.\"\n\n00:01:11.958 --> 00:01:13.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:01:13.958 --> 00:01:15.958\nIt could be an \"L,\" of course.\n\n00:01:15.958 --> 00:01:17.958\nSo, what else could it be?\n\n00:01:17.958 --> 00:01:20.958\nYeah, a lot of you got it.\n\n00:01:20.958 --> 00:01:23.958\nOh yeah. So, clever thing.\n\n00:01:23.958 --> 00:01:25.958\nNow, that was my first puzzle. I got hooked.\n\n00:01:25.958 --> 00:01:29.958\nI created something new, I was very excited\n\n00:01:29.958 --> 00:01:31.958\nbecause, you know, I'd made crossword puzzles,\n\n00:01:31.958 --> 00:01:34.958\nbut that's sort of like filling in somebody else's matrix.\n\n00:01:34.958 --> 00:01:36.958\nThis was something really original. I got hooked.\n\n00:01:36.958 --> 00:01:39.958\nI read Martin Gardner's columns in Scientific American.\n\n00:01:39.958 --> 00:01:43.958\nWent on, and eventually decided to devote myself, full time, to that.\n\n00:01:43.958 --> 00:01:46.958\nNow, I should pause and say, what do I mean by puzzle?\n\n00:01:46.958 --> 00:01:49.958\nA puzzle is a problem that is fun to solve\n\n00:01:49.958 --> 00:01:51.958\nand has a right answer.\n\n00:01:51.958 --> 00:01:55.958\n\"Fun to solve,\" as opposed to everyday problems,\n\n00:01:55.958 --> 00:01:58.958\nwhich, frankly, are not very well-designed puzzles.\n\n00:01:58.958 --> 00:02:00.958\nYou know, they might have a solution.\n\n00:02:00.958 --> 00:02:03.958\nIt might take a long time. Nobody wrote down the rules clearly.\n\n00:02:03.958 --> 00:02:05.958\nWho designed this?\n\n00:02:05.958 --> 00:02:07.958\nIt's like, you know, life is not a very well-written story\n\n00:02:07.958 --> 00:02:10.958\nso we have to hire writers to make movies.\n\n00:02:10.958 --> 00:02:13.958\nWell, I take everyday problems, and I make puzzles out of them.\n\n00:02:13.958 --> 00:02:16.958\nAnd \"right answer,\" of course there might be more than one right answer;\n\n00:02:16.958 --> 00:02:18.958\nmany puzzles have more than one.\n\n00:02:18.958 --> 00:02:20.958\nBut as opposed to a couple other forms of play,\n\n00:02:20.958 --> 00:02:22.958\ntoys and games --\n\n00:02:22.958 --> 00:02:25.958\nby toy I mean, something you play with that doesn't have a particular goal.\n\n00:02:25.958 --> 00:02:27.958\nYou can create one out of Legos.\n\n00:02:27.958 --> 00:02:29.958\nYou know, you can do anything you want.\n\n00:02:29.958 --> 00:02:32.958\nOr competitive games like chess where,\n\n00:02:32.958 --> 00:02:35.958\nwell, you're not trying to solve ... You can make a chess puzzle,\n\n00:02:35.958 --> 00:02:40.958\nbut the goal really is to beat another player.\n\n00:02:40.958 --> 00:02:42.958\nI consider that puzzles are an art form.\n\n00:02:42.958 --> 00:02:45.958\nThey're very ancient. It goes back as long as there is written history.\n\n00:02:45.958 --> 00:02:47.958\nIt's a very small form, like a joke,\n\n00:02:47.958 --> 00:02:51.958\na poem, a magic trick or a song, very compact form.\n\n00:02:51.958 --> 00:02:54.958\nAt worst, they're throwaways, they're for amusement.\n\n00:02:54.958 --> 00:02:57.958\nBut at best they can reach for something more\n\n00:02:57.958 --> 00:02:59.958\nand create a memorable impression.\n\n00:02:59.958 --> 00:03:01.958\nThe progression of my career that you'll see\n\n00:03:01.958 --> 00:03:05.958\nis looking for creating puzzles that have a memorable impact.\n\n00:03:05.958 --> 00:03:08.958\nSo, one thing I found early on, when I started doing computer games,\n\n00:03:08.958 --> 00:03:11.958\nis that I could create puzzles that will alter your perception.\n\n00:03:11.958 --> 00:03:14.958\nI'll show you how. Here is a famous one.\n\n00:03:14.958 --> 00:03:17.958\nSo, it's two profiles in black, or a white vase in the middle.\n\n00:03:17.958 --> 00:03:19.958\nThis is called a figure-ground illusion.\n\n00:03:19.958 --> 00:03:21.958\nThe artist M.C. Escher exploited that\n\n00:03:21.958 --> 00:03:23.958\nin some of his wonderful prints.\n\n00:03:23.958 --> 00:03:25.958\nHere we have \"Day and Night.\"\n\n00:03:25.958 --> 00:03:28.958\nHere is what I did with figure and ground.\n\n00:03:33.958 --> 00:03:35.958\nSo, here we have \"figure\" in black.\n\n00:03:35.958 --> 00:03:37.958\nHere we have \"figure\" in white.\n\n00:03:37.958 --> 00:03:40.958\nAnd it's all part of the same design.\n\n00:03:40.958 --> 00:03:42.958\nThe background to one is the other.\n\n00:03:42.958 --> 00:03:44.958\nOriginally I tried to do the words \"figure\" and \"ground.\"\n\n00:03:44.958 --> 00:03:47.958\nBut I couldn't do that, I realized. I changed the problem.\n\n00:03:47.958 --> 00:03:49.958\nIt's all \"figure.\"\n\n00:03:49.958 --> 00:03:51.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:03:51.958 --> 00:03:54.958\nA few other things. Here is my name.\n\n00:03:54.958 --> 00:03:59.958\nAnd that turns into the title of my first book, \"Inversions.\"\n\n00:03:59.958 --> 00:04:03.958\nThese sorts of designs now go by the word \"ambigram.\"\n\n00:04:03.958 --> 00:04:05.958\nI'll show you just a couple others. Here we have\n\n00:04:05.958 --> 00:04:08.958\nthe numbers one through 10, the digits zero through nine, actually.\n\n00:04:08.958 --> 00:04:11.958\nEach letter here is one of these digits.\n\n00:04:11.958 --> 00:04:14.958\nNot strictly an ambigram in the conventional sense.\n\n00:04:14.958 --> 00:04:17.958\nI like pushing on what an ambigram can mean.\n\n00:04:17.958 --> 00:04:19.958\nHere's the word \"mirror.\" No, it's not the same upside-down.\n\n00:04:19.958 --> 00:04:23.958\nIt's the same this way.\n\n00:04:23.958 --> 00:04:25.958\nAnd a marvelous fellow from the Media Lab\n\n00:04:25.958 --> 00:04:29.958\nwho just got appointed head of RISD, is John Maeda.\n\n00:04:29.958 --> 00:04:33.958\nAnd so I did this for him. It's sort of a visual canon.\n\n00:04:33.958 --> 00:04:34.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:04:36.958 --> 00:04:41.958\nAnd recently in Magic magazine\n\n00:04:41.958 --> 00:04:43.958\nI've done a number of ambigrams on magician's names.\n\n00:04:43.958 --> 00:04:48.958\nSo here we have Penn and Teller, same upside-down.\n\n00:04:48.958 --> 00:04:51.958\nThis appears in my puzzle calendar.\n\n00:04:51.958 --> 00:04:53.958\nOkay, let's go back to the slides.\n\n00:04:53.958 --> 00:04:55.958\nThank you very much.\n\n00:04:55.958 --> 00:04:57.958\nNow, those are fun to look at.\n\n00:04:57.958 --> 00:05:00.958\nNow how would you do it interactively?\n\n00:05:00.958 --> 00:05:02.958\nFor a while I was an interface designer.\n\n00:05:02.958 --> 00:05:04.958\nAnd so I think a lot about interaction.\n\n00:05:04.958 --> 00:05:06.958\nWell, let's first of all simplify the vases illusion,\n\n00:05:06.958 --> 00:05:08.958\nmake the thing on the right.\n\n00:05:08.958 --> 00:05:10.958\nNow, if you could pick up the black vase,\n\n00:05:10.958 --> 00:05:12.958\nit would look like the figure on top.\n\n00:05:12.958 --> 00:05:14.958\nIf you could pick up the white area,\n\n00:05:14.958 --> 00:05:16.958\nit would look like the figure on the bottom.\n\n00:05:16.958 --> 00:05:18.958\nWell, you can't do that physically,\n\n00:05:18.958 --> 00:05:20.958\nbut on a computer you can do it. Let's switch over to the P.C.\n\n00:05:20.958 --> 00:05:24.958\nAnd here it is, figure-ground.\n\n00:05:24.958 --> 00:05:27.958\nThe goal here is to take the pieces on the left\n\n00:05:27.958 --> 00:05:30.958\nand make them so they look like the shape on the right.\n\n00:05:30.958 --> 00:05:32.958\nAnd this follows the rules I just said:\n\n00:05:32.958 --> 00:05:35.958\nany black area that is surrounded by white can be picked up.\n\n00:05:35.958 --> 00:05:37.958\nBut that is also true of any white area.\n\n00:05:37.958 --> 00:05:39.958\nSo, here we got the white area in the middle,\n\n00:05:39.958 --> 00:05:41.958\nand you can pick it up.\n\n00:05:41.958 --> 00:05:43.958\nI'll just go one step further.\n\n00:05:43.958 --> 00:05:45.958\nSo, here is --\n\n00:05:45.958 --> 00:05:47.958\nhere is a couple pieces. Move them together,\n\n00:05:47.958 --> 00:05:50.958\nand now this is an active piece.\n\n00:05:50.958 --> 00:05:52.958\nYou can really get inside somebody's perception\n\n00:05:52.958 --> 00:05:54.958\nand have them experience something.\n\n00:05:54.958 --> 00:05:56.958\nIt's like the old maxim of\n\n00:05:56.958 --> 00:05:58.958\n\"you can tell somebody something\n\n00:05:58.958 --> 00:06:00.958\nand show them, but if they do it they really learn it.\"\n\n00:06:00.958 --> 00:06:02.958\nHere is another thing you can do.\n\n00:06:02.958 --> 00:06:04.958\nThere is a game called Rush Hour.\n\n00:06:04.958 --> 00:06:06.958\nThis is one of the true masterpieces in puzzle design\n\n00:06:06.958 --> 00:06:08.958\nbesides Rubik's cube.\n\n00:06:08.958 --> 00:06:10.958\nSo, here we have a crowded parking lot\n\n00:06:10.958 --> 00:06:12.958\nwith cars all over the place.\n\n00:06:12.958 --> 00:06:15.958\nThe goal is to get the red car out. It's a sliding block puzzle.\n\n00:06:15.958 --> 00:06:17.958\nIt's made by the company Think Fun.\n\n00:06:17.958 --> 00:06:19.958\nIt's done very well. I love this puzzle.\n\n00:06:19.958 --> 00:06:22.958\nWell, let's play one. Here. So, here is a very simple puzzle.\n\n00:06:22.958 --> 00:06:24.958\nWell, that's too simple, let's add another piece.\n\n00:06:24.958 --> 00:06:26.958\nOkay, so how would you solve this one?\n\n00:06:26.958 --> 00:06:28.958\nWell, move the blue one out of the way.\n\n00:06:28.958 --> 00:06:30.958\nHere, let's make it a little harder. Still pretty easy.\n\n00:06:30.958 --> 00:06:33.958\nNow we'll make it harder, a little harder.\n\n00:06:33.958 --> 00:06:35.958\nNow, this one is a little bit trickier.\n\n00:06:35.958 --> 00:06:37.958\nYou know? What do you do here?\n\n00:06:37.958 --> 00:06:39.958\nThe first move is going to be what?\n\n00:06:39.958 --> 00:06:43.958\nYou're going to move the blue one up in order to get the lavender one to the right.\n\n00:06:43.958 --> 00:06:46.958\nAnd you can make puzzles like this one that aren't solvable at all.\n\n00:06:46.958 --> 00:06:48.958\nThose four are locked in a pinwheel; you can't get them apart.\n\n00:06:48.958 --> 00:06:50.958\nI wanted to make a sequel.\n\n00:06:50.958 --> 00:06:52.958\nI didn't come up with the original idea. But this is another way\n\n00:06:52.958 --> 00:06:55.958\nI work as an inventor is to create a sequel.\n\n00:06:55.958 --> 00:06:57.958\nI came up with this. This is Railroad Rush Hour.\n\n00:06:57.958 --> 00:07:00.958\nIt's the same basic game except I introduced a new piece,\n\n00:07:00.958 --> 00:07:03.958\na square piece that can move both horizontally and vertically.\n\n00:07:03.958 --> 00:07:06.958\nIn the other game the cars can only move forward and back.\n\n00:07:06.958 --> 00:07:09.958\nCreated a whole bunch of levels for it.\n\n00:07:09.958 --> 00:07:11.958\nNow I'm making it available to schools.\n\n00:07:11.958 --> 00:07:13.958\nAnd it includes exercises that show you\n\n00:07:13.958 --> 00:07:15.958\nnot just how to solve these puzzles,\n\n00:07:15.958 --> 00:07:18.958\nbut how to extract the principles that will let you solve\n\n00:07:18.958 --> 00:07:22.958\nmathematical puzzles or problems in science, other areas.\n\n00:07:22.958 --> 00:07:25.958\nSo, I'm really interested in you learning how to make your own puzzles\n\n00:07:25.958 --> 00:07:27.958\nas well as just me creating them.\n\n00:07:27.958 --> 00:07:30.958\nGarry Trudeau calls himself an investigative cartoonist.\n\n00:07:30.958 --> 00:07:33.958\nYou know, he does a lot of research before he writes a cartoon.\n\n00:07:33.958 --> 00:07:36.958\nIn Discover Magazine, I'm an investigative puzzle maker.\n\n00:07:36.958 --> 00:07:38.958\nI got interested in gene sequencing.\n\n00:07:38.958 --> 00:07:41.958\nAnd I said, \"Well, how on Earth can you come up with a sequence\n\n00:07:41.958 --> 00:07:44.958\nof the base pairs in DNA?\"\n\n00:07:44.958 --> 00:07:46.958\nCut up the DNA, you sequence individual pieces,\n\n00:07:46.958 --> 00:07:48.958\nand then you look for overlaps,\n\n00:07:48.958 --> 00:07:50.958\nand you basically match them at the edges. And I said,\n\n00:07:50.958 --> 00:07:53.958\n\"This is kind of like a jigsaw puzzle, except the pieces overlap.\"\n\n00:07:53.958 --> 00:07:56.958\nSo, here is what I created for Discover Magazine.\n\n00:07:56.958 --> 00:07:58.958\nAnd it has to be solvable in a magazine.\n\n00:07:58.958 --> 00:08:00.958\nYou know, you can't cut out the pieces and move them around.\n\n00:08:00.958 --> 00:08:05.958\nSo, here is the nine pieces. And you're supposed to put them into this grid.\n\n00:08:05.958 --> 00:08:08.958\nAnd you have to choose pieces that overlap on the edge.\n\n00:08:08.958 --> 00:08:10.958\nThere is only one solution. It's not that hard.\n\n00:08:10.958 --> 00:08:12.958\nBut it takes some persistence.\n\n00:08:12.958 --> 00:08:14.958\nAnd when you're done, it makes this design,\n\n00:08:14.958 --> 00:08:19.958\nwhich, if you squint, is the word \"helix.\"\n\n00:08:19.958 --> 00:08:22.958\nSo, that's the form of the puzzle coming out of the content,\n\n00:08:22.958 --> 00:08:24.958\nrather than the other way around.\n\n00:08:24.958 --> 00:08:27.958\nHere is a couple more. Here is a physics-based puzzle.\n\n00:08:27.958 --> 00:08:29.958\nWhich way will these fall?\n\n00:08:29.958 --> 00:08:32.958\nOne of these weighs 50 pounds, 30 pounds and 10 pounds.\n\n00:08:32.958 --> 00:08:34.958\nAnd depending on which one weighs which amount,\n\n00:08:34.958 --> 00:08:36.958\nthey'll fall different directions.\n\n00:08:36.958 --> 00:08:38.958\nAnd here is a puzzle based on color mixing.\n\n00:08:38.958 --> 00:08:41.958\nI separated this image into cyan, magenta, yellow, black,\n\n00:08:41.958 --> 00:08:43.958\nthe basic printing colors, and then mixed up the separations,\n\n00:08:43.958 --> 00:08:45.958\nand you get these peculiar pictures.\n\n00:08:45.958 --> 00:08:48.958\nWhich separations were mixed up to make those pictures?\n\n00:08:48.958 --> 00:08:50.958\nGets you thinking about color.\n\n00:08:50.958 --> 00:08:53.958\nFinally, what I'm doing now. So, ShuffleBrain.com,\n\n00:08:53.958 --> 00:08:57.958\nwebsite you can go visit, I joined up with my wife, Amy-Jo Kim.\n\n00:08:57.958 --> 00:09:00.958\nShe could easily be up here giving a talk about her work.\n\n00:09:00.958 --> 00:09:02.958\nSo, we're making smart games for social media.\n\n00:09:02.958 --> 00:09:06.958\nI'll explain what that means. We're looking at three trends.\n\n00:09:06.958 --> 00:09:09.958\nThis is what's going on in the games industry right now.\n\n00:09:09.958 --> 00:09:12.958\nFirst of all, you know, for a long time\n\n00:09:12.958 --> 00:09:14.958\ncomputer games meant things like \"Doom,\"\n\n00:09:14.958 --> 00:09:17.958\nwhere you're going around shooting things, very violent games, very fast,\n\n00:09:17.958 --> 00:09:20.958\naimed at teenage boys. Right? That's who plays computer games.\n\n00:09:20.958 --> 00:09:22.958\nWell, guess what? That's changing.\n\n00:09:22.958 --> 00:09:24.958\n\"Bejeweled\" is a big hit. It was the game that really broke open\n\n00:09:24.958 --> 00:09:27.958\nwhat's called casual games.\n\n00:09:27.958 --> 00:09:31.958\nAnd the main players are over 35, and are female.\n\n00:09:31.958 --> 00:09:33.958\nThen recently \"Rock Band\" has been a big hit.\n\n00:09:33.958 --> 00:09:35.958\nAnd it's a game you play with other people.\n\n00:09:35.958 --> 00:09:38.958\nIt's very physical. It looks nothing like a traditional game.\n\n00:09:38.958 --> 00:09:42.958\nThis is what's becoming the dominant form of electronic gaming.\n\n00:09:42.958 --> 00:09:44.958\nNow, within that there is some interesting things happening.\n\n00:09:44.958 --> 00:09:47.958\nThere is also a trend towards games that are good for you.\n\n00:09:47.958 --> 00:09:49.958\nWhy? Well, we aging Boomers,\n\n00:09:49.958 --> 00:09:52.958\nBaby Boomers, we're eating our healthy food,\n\n00:09:52.958 --> 00:09:54.958\nwe're exercising. What about our minds?\n\n00:09:54.958 --> 00:09:58.958\nOh no, our parents are getting Alzheimer's. We better do something.\n\n00:09:58.958 --> 00:10:02.958\nTurns out doing crossword puzzles can stave off some of the effects of Alzheimer's.\n\n00:10:02.958 --> 00:10:07.958\nSo, we got games like \"Brain Age\" coming out for the Nintendo DS, huge hit.\n\n00:10:07.958 --> 00:10:11.958\nA lot of people do Sudoku. In fact some doctors prescribe it.\n\n00:10:11.958 --> 00:10:14.958\nAnd then there is social media, and what's happening on the Internet.\n\n00:10:14.958 --> 00:10:17.958\nEverybody now considers themselves a creator,\n\n00:10:17.958 --> 00:10:19.958\nand not just a viewer.\n\n00:10:19.958 --> 00:10:21.958\nAnd what does this add up to?\n\n00:10:21.958 --> 00:10:23.958\nHere is what we see coming.\n\n00:10:23.958 --> 00:10:26.958\nIt's games that fit into a healthy lifestyle.\n\n00:10:26.958 --> 00:10:29.958\nThey're part of your life. They're not necessarily a separate thing.\n\n00:10:29.958 --> 00:10:32.958\nAnd they are both, something that is good for you, and they're fun.\n\n00:10:32.958 --> 00:10:35.958\nI'm a puzzle guy. My wife is an expert in social media.\n\n00:10:35.958 --> 00:10:37.958\nAnd we decided to combine our skills.\n\n00:10:37.958 --> 00:10:40.958\nOur first game is called \"Photo Grab.\" The game takes about a minute and 20 seconds.\n\n00:10:40.958 --> 00:10:42.958\nThis is your first time playing my game. Okay.\n\n00:10:42.958 --> 00:10:45.958\nLet's see how well we can do. There are three images.\n\n00:10:45.958 --> 00:10:47.958\nAnd we have 24 seconds each.\n\n00:10:47.958 --> 00:10:49.958\nWhere is that?\n\n00:10:49.958 --> 00:10:51.958\nI'll play as fast as I can.\n\n00:10:51.958 --> 00:10:54.958\nBut if you can see it, shout out the answer.\n\n00:10:54.958 --> 00:10:57.958\nYou get more -- Down, okay, yeah where is that?\n\n00:10:57.958 --> 00:11:01.958\nOh, yeah. There, okay. J-O and --\n\n00:11:01.958 --> 00:11:04.958\nI guess that's that part. We got the bow. That bow helps.\n\n00:11:04.958 --> 00:11:07.958\nThat's his hair. You get a lot of figure-ground problems.\n\n00:11:07.958 --> 00:11:12.958\nYeah, that one is easy. Okay. So, ahhh! Okay on to the next one.\n\n00:11:12.958 --> 00:11:14.958\nOkay, so that's the lens.\n\n00:11:14.958 --> 00:11:16.958\nAnybody?\n\n00:11:16.958 --> 00:11:19.958\nLooks like a black shape. So, where is that?\n\n00:11:19.958 --> 00:11:22.958\nThat's the corner of the whole thing.\n\n00:11:22.958 --> 00:11:24.958\nYeah, I've played this image before,\n\n00:11:24.958 --> 00:11:26.958\nbut even when I make up my own puzzles --\n\n00:11:26.958 --> 00:11:28.958\nand you can put your own images in here.\n\n00:11:28.958 --> 00:11:32.958\nAnd we have people all over the world doing that now.\n\n00:11:32.958 --> 00:11:34.958\nThere we are.

I'm talking to you about modern-day slavery.I'd like to tell you the story of these three children, Pranitha, Shaheen and Anjali. Pranitha's mother was a woman in prostitution, a prostituted person. She got infected with HIV, and towards the end of her life, when she was in the final stages of AIDS, she could not prostitute, so she sold four-year-old Pranitha to a broker. By the time we got the information, we reached there, Pranitha was already raped by three men.Shaheen's background I don't even know. We found her in a railway track, raped by many, many men, I don't know many. But the indications of that on her body was that her intestine was outside her body. And when we took her to the hospital she needed 32 stitches to put back her intestine into her body. We still don't know who her parents are, who she is. All that we know that hundreds of men had used her brutally.Anjali's father, a drunkard, sold his child for pornography. You're seeing here images of three years, four-year-olds, and five-year-old children who have been trafficked for commercial sexual exploitation. In this country, and across the globe, hundreds and thousands of children, as young as three, as young as four, are sold into sexual slavery. But that's not the only purpose that human beings are sold for. They are sold in the name of adoption. They are sold in the name of organ trade. They are sold in the name of forced labor, camel jockeying, anything, everything.I work on the issue of commercial sexual exploitation. And I tell you stories from there. My own journey to work with these children started as a teenager. I was 15 when I was gang-raped by eight men. I don't remember the rape part of it so much as much as the anger part of it. Yes, there were eight men who defiled me, raped me, but that didn't go into my consciousness. I never felt like a victim, then or now. But what lingered from then till now \u2014 I am 40 today \u2014 is this huge outrageous anger.Two years, I was ostracized, I was stigmatized, I was isolated, because I was a victim. And that's what we do to all traffic survivors. We, as a society, we have PhDs in victimizing a victim. Right from the age of 15, when I started looking around me, I started seeing hundreds and thousands of women and children who are left in sexual slavery-like practices, but have absolutely no respite, because we don't allow them to come in.Where does their journey begin? Most of them come from very optionless families, not just poor. You have even the middle class sometimes getting trafficked. I had this I.S. officer's daughter, who is 14 years old, studying in ninth standard, who was raped chatting with one individual, and ran away from home because she wanted to become a heroine, who was trafficked. I have hundreds and thousands of stories of very very well-to-do families, and children from well-to-do families, who are getting trafficked.These people are deceived, forced. 99.9 percent of them resist being inducted into prostitution. Some pay the price for it. They're killed; we don't even hear about them. They are voiceless, [unclear], nameless people. But the rest, who succumb into it, go through everyday torture. Because the men who come to them are not men who want to make you your girlfriends, or who want to have a family with you. These are men who buy you for an hour, for a day, and use you, throw you.Each of the girls that I have rescued \u2014 I have rescued more than 3,200 girls \u2014 each of them tell me one story in common ... (Applause) one story about one man, at least, putting chili powder in her vagina, one man taking a cigarette and burning her, one man whipping her. We are living among those men: they're our brothers, fathers, uncles, cousins, all around us. And we are silent about them.We think it is easy money. We think it is shortcut. We think the person likes to do what she's doing. But the extra bonuses that she gets is various infections, sexually transmitted infections, HIV, AIDS, syphilis, gonorrhea, you name it, substance abuse, drugs, everything under the sun. And one day she gives up on you and me, because we have no options for her. And therefore she starts normalizing this exploitation. She believes, \"Yes, this is it, this is what my destiny is about.\" And this is normal, to get raped by 100 men a day. And it's abnormal to live in a shelter. It's abnormal to get rehabilitated.It's in that context that I work. It's in that context that I rescue children. I've rescued children as young as three years, and I've rescued women as old as 40 years. When I rescued them, one of the biggest challenges I had was where do I begin. Because I had lots of them who were already HIV infected. One third of the people I rescue are HIV positive. And therefore my challenge was to understand how can I get out the power from this pain. And for me, I was my greatest experience. Understanding my own self, understanding my own pain, my own isolation, was my greatest teacher. Because what we did with these girls is to understand their potential.You see a girl here who is trained as a welder. She works for a very big company, a workshop in Hyderabad, making furnitures. She earns around 12,000 rupees. She is an illiterate girl, trained, skilled as a welder. Why welding and why not computers? We felt, one of the things that these girls had is immense amount of courage. They did not have any pardas inside their body, hijabs inside themselves; they've crossed the barrier of it. And therefore they could fight in a male-dominated world, very easily, and not feel very shy about it.We have trained girls as carpenters, as masons, as security guards, as cab drivers. And each one of them are excelling in their chosen field, gaining confidence, restoring dignity, and building hopes in their own lives. These girls are also working in big construction companies like Ram-ki construction, as masons, full-time masons.What has been my challenge? My challenge has not been the traffickers who beat me up. I've been beaten up more than 14 times in my life. I can't hear from my right ear. I've lost a staff of mine who was murdered while on a rescue. My biggest challenge is society. It's you and me. My biggest challenge is your blocks to accept these victims as our own.A very supportive friend of mine, a well-wisher of mine, used to give me every month, 2,000 rupees for vegetables. When her mother fell sick she said, \"Sunitha, you have so much of contacts. Can you get somebody in my house to work, so that she can look after my mother?\" And there is a long pause. And then she says, \"Not one of our girls.\"It's very fashionable to talk about human trafficking, in this fantastic A-C hall. It's very nice for discussion, discourse, making films and everything. But it is not nice to bring them to our homes. It's not nice to give them employment in our factories, our companies. It's not nice for our children to study with their children. There it ends. That's my biggest challenge.If I'm here today, I'm here not only as Sunitha Krishnan. I'm here as a voice of the victims and survivors of human trafficking. They need your compassion. They need your empathy. They need, much more than anything else, your acceptance.Many times when I talk to people, I keep telling them one thing: don't tell me hundred ways how you cannot respond to this problem. Can you ply your mind for that one way that you can respond to the problem? And that's what I'm here for, asking for your support, demanding for your support, requesting for your support. Can you break your culture of silence? Can you speak to at least two persons about this story? Tell them this story. Convince them to tell the story to another two persons.I'm not asking you all to become Mahatma Gandhis or Martin Luther Kings, or Medha Patkars, or something like that. I'm asking you, in your limited world, can you open your minds? Can you open your hearts? Can you just encompass these people too? Because they are also a part of us. They are also part of this world. I'm asking you, for these children, whose faces you see, they're no more. They died of AIDS last year. I'm asking you to help them, accept as human beings \u2014 not as philanthropy, not as charity, but as human beings who deserve all our support. I'm asking you this because no child, no human being, deserves what these children have gone through. Thank you.

around me,\n\n00:03:39.958 --> 00:03:43.958\nI started seeing hundreds and thousands of women and children\n\n00:03:43.958 --> 00:03:47.958\nwho are left in sexual slavery-like practices,\n\n00:03:47.958 --> 00:03:50.958\nbut have absolutely no respite,\n\n00:03:50.958 --> 00:03:54.958\nbecause we don't allow them to come in.\n\n00:03:54.958 --> 00:03:56.958\nWhere does their journey begin?\n\n00:03:56.958 --> 00:04:00.958\nMost of them come from very optionless families,\n\n00:04:00.958 --> 00:04:02.958\nnot just poor.\n\n00:04:02.958 --> 00:04:05.958\nYou have even the middle class sometimes getting trafficked.\n\n00:04:05.958 --> 00:04:08.958\nI had this I.S. officer's daughter,\n\n00:04:08.958 --> 00:04:13.958\nwho is 14 years old, studying in ninth standard,\n\n00:04:13.958 --> 00:04:17.958\nwho was raped chatting with one individual,\n\n00:04:17.958 --> 00:04:20.958\nand ran away from home because she wanted to become a heroine,\n\n00:04:20.958 --> 00:04:22.958\nwho was trafficked.\n\n00:04:22.958 --> 00:04:27.958\nI have hundreds and thousands of stories of very very well-to-do families,\n\n00:04:27.958 --> 00:04:29.958\nand children from well-to-do families,\n\n00:04:29.958 --> 00:04:31.958\nwho are getting trafficked.\n\n00:04:31.958 --> 00:04:35.958\nThese people are deceived, forced.\n\n00:04:35.958 --> 00:04:37.958\n99.9 percent of them\n\n00:04:37.958 --> 00:04:41.958\nresist being inducted into prostitution.\n\n00:04:41.958 --> 00:04:44.958\nSome pay the price for it.\n\n00:04:44.958 --> 00:04:48.958\nThey're killed; we don't even hear about them.\n\n00:04:48.958 --> 00:04:50.958\nThey are voiceless, [unclear],\n\n00:04:50.958 --> 00:04:52.958\nnameless people.\n\n00:04:52.958 --> 00:04:56.958\nBut the rest, who succumb into it,\n\n00:04:56.958 --> 00:05:00.958\ngo through everyday torture.\n\n00:05:00.958 --> 00:05:03.958\nBecause the men who come to them are not men who want to make you your girlfriends,\n\n00:05:03.958 --> 00:05:07.958\nor who want to have a family with you.\n\n00:05:07.958 --> 00:05:10.958\nThese are men who buy you for an hour, for a day,\n\n00:05:10.958 --> 00:05:13.958\nand use you, throw you.\n\n00:05:13.958 --> 00:05:15.958\nEach of the girls that I have rescued --\n\n00:05:15.958 --> 00:05:18.958\nI have rescued more than 3,200 girls --\n\n00:05:18.958 --> 00:05:21.958\neach of them tell me one story in common ...\n\n00:05:21.958 --> 00:05:23.958\n(Applause)\n\n00:05:23.958 --> 00:05:26.958\none story about one man, at least,\n\n00:05:26.958 --> 00:05:29.958\nputting chili powder in her vagina,\n\n00:05:29.958 --> 00:05:32.958\none man taking a cigarette and burning her,\n\n00:05:32.958 --> 00:05:34.958\none man whipping her.\n\n00:05:34.958 --> 00:05:37.958\nWe are living among those men: they're our brothers, fathers,\n\n00:05:37.958 --> 00:05:40.958\nuncles, cousins, all around us.\n\n00:05:40.958 --> 00:05:42.958\nAnd we are silent about them.\n\n00:05:42.958 --> 00:05:44.958\nWe think it is easy money.\n\n00:05:44.958 --> 00:05:46.958\nWe think it is shortcut.\n\n00:05:46.958 --> 00:05:50.958\nWe think the person likes to do what she's doing.\n\n00:05:50.958 --> 00:05:53.958\nBut the extra bonuses that she gets\n\n00:05:53.958 --> 00:05:56.958\nis various infections, sexually transmitted infections,\n\n00:05:56.958 --> 00:05:59.958\nHIV, AIDS, syphilis, gonorrhea, you name it,\n\n00:05:59.958 --> 00:06:03.958\nsubstance abuse, drugs, everything under the sun.\n\n00:06:03.958 --> 00:06:05.958\nAnd one day she gives up on you and me,\n\n00:06:05.958 --> 00:06:08.958\nbecause we have no options for her.\n\n00:06:08.958 --> 00:06:11.958\nAnd therefore she starts normalizing this exploitation.\n\n00:06:11.958 --> 00:06:16.958\nShe believes, \"Yes, this is it, this is what my destiny is about.\"\n\n00:06:16.958 --> 00:06:20.958\nAnd this is normal, to get raped by 100 men a day.\n\n00:06:20.958 --> 00:06:23.958\nAnd it's abnormal to live in a shelter.\n\n00:06:23.958 --> 00:06:26.958\nIt's abnormal to get rehabilitated.\n\n00:06:26.958 --> 00:06:28.958\nIt's in that context that I work.\n\n00:06:28.958 --> 00:06:32.958\nIt's in that context that I rescue children.\n\n00:06:32.958 --> 00:06:34.958\nI've rescued children as young as three years,\n\n00:06:34.958 --> 00:06:40.958\nand I've rescued women as old as 40 years.\n\n00:06:40.958 --> 00:06:43.958\nWhen I rescued them, one of the biggest challenges I had\n\n00:06:43.958 --> 00:06:47.958\nwas where do I begin.\n\n00:06:47.958 --> 00:06:51.958\nBecause I had lots of them\n\n00:06:51.958 --> 00:06:55.958\nwho were already HIV infected.\n\n00:06:55.958 --> 00:06:57.958\nOne third of the people I rescue\n\n00:06:57.958 --> 00:07:00.958\nare HIV positive.\n\n00:07:00.958 --> 00:07:03.958\nAnd therefore my challenge was to\n\n00:07:03.958 --> 00:07:06.958\nunderstand how can I get out\n\n00:07:06.958 --> 00:07:09.958\nthe power from this pain.\n\n00:07:09.958 --> 00:07:13.958\nAnd for me, I was my greatest experience.\n\n00:07:13.958 --> 00:07:16.958\nUnderstanding my own self,\n\n00:07:16.958 --> 00:07:18.958\nunderstanding my own pain,\n\n00:07:18.958 --> 00:07:21.958\nmy own isolation,\n\n00:07:21.958 --> 00:07:23.958\nwas my greatest teacher.\n\n00:07:23.958 --> 00:07:25.958\nBecause what we did with these girls\n\n00:07:25.958 --> 00:07:28.958\nis to understand their potential.\n\n00:07:28.958 --> 00:07:33.958\nYou see a girl here who is trained as a welder.\n\n00:07:33.958 --> 00:07:36.958\nShe works for a very big company,\n\n00:07:36.958 --> 00:07:38.958\na workshop in Hyderabad,\n\n00:07:38.958 --> 00:07:40.958\nmaking furnitures.\n\n00:07:40.958 --> 00:07:43.958\nShe earns around 12,000 rupees.\n\n00:07:43.958 --> 00:07:45.958\nShe is an illiterate girl,\n\n00:07:45.958 --> 00:07:48.958\ntrained, skilled as a welder.\n\n00:07:48.958 --> 00:07:53.958\nWhy welding and why not computers?\n\n00:07:53.958 --> 00:07:58.958\nWe felt, one of the things that these girls had\n\n00:07:58.958 --> 00:08:02.958\nis immense amount of courage.\n\n00:08:02.958 --> 00:08:06.958\nThey did not have any pardas inside their body,\n\n00:08:06.958 --> 00:08:09.958\nhijabs inside themselves;\n\n00:08:09.958 --> 00:08:11.958\nthey've crossed the barrier of it.\n\n00:08:11.958 --> 00:08:15.958\nAnd therefore they could fight in a male-dominated world,\n\n00:08:15.958 --> 00:08:19.958\nvery easily, and not feel very shy about it.\n\n00:08:19.958 --> 00:08:22.958\nWe have trained girls as carpenters,\n\n00:08:22.958 --> 00:08:24.958\nas masons,\n\n00:08:24.958 --> 00:08:27.958\nas security guards, as cab drivers.\n\n00:08:27.958 --> 00:08:31.958\nAnd each one of them are excelling\n\n00:08:31.958 --> 00:08:33.958\nin their chosen field,\n\n00:08:33.958 --> 00:08:37.958\ngaining confidence, restoring dignity,\n\n00:08:37.958 --> 00:08:40.958\nand building hopes in their own lives.\n\n00:08:40.958 --> 00:08:44.958\nThese girls are also working in big construction companies\n\n00:08:44.958 --> 00:08:50.958\nlike Ram-ki construction, as masons, full-time masons.\n\n00:08:50.958 --> 00:08:54.958\nWhat has been my challenge?\n\n00:08:54.958 --> 00:08:59.958\nMy challenge has not been the traffickers who beat me up.\n\n00:08:59.958 --> 00:09:03.958\nI've been beaten up more than 14 times in my life.\n\n00:09:03.958 --> 00:09:07.958\nI can't hear from my right ear.\n\n00:09:07.958 --> 00:09:09.958\nI've lost a staff of mine who was murdered\n\n00:09:09.958 --> 00:09:12.958\nwhile on a rescue.\n\n00:09:12.958 --> 00:09:14.958\nMy biggest challenge\n\n00:09:14.958 --> 00:09:16.958\nis society.\n\n00:09:16.958 --> 00:09:19.958\nIt's you and me.\n\n00:09:19.958 --> 00:09:23.958\nMy biggest challenge is your blocks to accept these victims\n\n00:09:23.958 --> 00:09:26.958\nas our own.\n\n00:09:26.958 --> 00:09:29.958\nA very supportive friend of mine,\n\n00:09:29.958 --> 00:09:32.958\na well-wisher of mine,\n\n00:09:32.958 --> 00:09:36.958\nused to give me every month, 2,000 rupees for vegetables.\n\n00:09:36.958 --> 00:09:38.958\nWhen her mother fell sick she said,\n\n00:09:38.958 --> 00:09:40.958\n\"Sunitha, you have so much of contacts.\n\n00:09:40.958 --> 00:09:43.958\nCan you get somebody in my house to work,\n\n00:09:43.958 --> 00:09:45.958\nso that she can look after my mother?\"\n\n00:09:45.958 --> 00:09:47.958\nAnd there is a long pause.\n\n00:09:47.958 --> 00:09:51.958\nAnd then she says, \"Not one of our girls.\"\n\n00:09:51.958 --> 00:09:54.958\nIt's very fashionable to talk about human trafficking,\n\n00:09:54.958 --> 00:09:57.958\nin this fantastic A-C hall.\n\n00:09:57.958 --> 00:10:01.958\nIt's very nice for discussion, discourse,\n\n00:10:01.958 --> 00:10:03.958\nmaking films and everything.\n\n00:10:03.958 --> 00:10:07.958\nBut it is not nice to bring them to our homes.\n\n00:10:07.958 --> 00:10:13.958\nIt's not nice to give them employment in our factories, our companies.\n\n00:10:13.958 --> 00:10:17.958\nIt's not nice for our children to study with their children.\n\n00:10:17.958 --> 00:10:19.958\nThere it ends.\n\n00:10:19.958 --> 00:10:21.958\nThat's my biggest challenge.\n\n00:10:21.958 --> 00:10:25.958\nIf I'm here today, I'm here not only as Sunitha Krishnan.\n\n00:10:25.958 --> 00:10:30.958\nI'm here as a voice of the victims and survivors of human trafficking.\n\n00:10:30.958 --> 00:10:33.958\nThey need your compassion.\n\n00:10:33.958 --> 00:10:35.958\nThey need your empathy.\n\n00:10:35.958 --> 00:10:37.958\nThey need, much more than anything else,\n\n00:10:37.958 --> 00:10:41.958\nyour acceptance.\n\n00:10:41.958 --> 00:10:43.958\nMany times when I talk to people,\n\n00:10:43.958 --> 00:10:45.958\nI keep telling them one thing:\n\n00:10:45.958 --> 00:10:48.958\ndon't tell me hundred ways\n\n00:10:48.958 --> 00:10:51.958\nhow you cannot respond to this problem.\n\n00:10:51.958 --> 00:10:54.958\nCan you ply your mind for that one way\n\n00:10:54.958 --> 00:10:57.958\nthat you can respond to the problem?\n\n00:10:57.958 --> 00:10:59.958\nAnd that's what I'm here for,\n\n00:10:59.958 --> 00:11:01.958\nasking for your support,\n\n00:11:01.958 --> 00:11:03.958\ndemanding for your support,\n\n00:11:03.958 --> 00:11:05.958\nrequesting for your support.\n\n00:11:05.958 --> 00:11:08.958\nCan you break your culture of silence?\n\n00:11:08.958 --> 00:11:12.958\nCan you speak to at least two persons about this story?\n\n00:11:12.958 --> 00:11:17.958\nTell them this story. Convince them to tell the story to another two persons.\n\n00:11:17.958 --> 00:11:19.958\nI'm not asking you all to become Mahatma Gandhis\n\n00:11:19.958 --> 00:11:21.958\nor Martin Luther Kings, or Medha Patkars,\n\n00:11:21.958 --> 00:11:23.958\nor something like that.\n\n00:11:23.958 --> 00:11:26.958\nI'm asking you, in your limited world,\n\n00:11:26.958 --> 00:11:29.958\ncan you open your minds? Can you open your hearts?\n\n00:11:29.958 --> 00:11:33.958\nCan you just encompass these people too?\n\n00:11:33.958 --> 00:11:36.958\nBecause they are also a part of us.\n\n00:11:36.958 --> 00:11:38.958\nThey are also part of this world.\n\n00:11:38.958 --> 00:11:42.958\nI'm asking you, for these children,\n\n00:11:42.958 --> 00:11:44.958\nwhose faces you see, they're no more.\n\n00:11:44.958 --> 00:11:47.958\nThey died of AIDS last year.\n\n00:11:47.958 --> 00:11:51.958\nI'm asking you to help them,\n\n00:11:51.958 --> 00:11:54.958\naccept as human beings --\n\n00:11:54.958 --> 00:11:57.958\nnot as philanthropy, not as charity,\n\n00:11:57.958 --> 00:12:01.958\nbut as human beings who deserve all our support.\n\n00:12:01.958 --> 00:12:05.958\nI'm asking you this because no child, no human being,\n\n00:12:05.958 --> 00:12:08.958\ndeserves what these children have gone through.\n\n00:12:08.958 --> 00:12:10.958\nThank you.\n\n00:12:10.958 --> 00:12:31.958\n(Applause)"}, {"title": "A one-man world summit", "duration": "881", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/rory_bremner_s_one_man_world_summit", "transcript": "Chris has been so nice. I don't know how you keep it up, Chris, I really don't. So nice, all week. He's the kind of man you could say to, \"Chris, I'm really sorry, I've crashed your car. And it gets worse, I crashed it into your house. Your house has caught fire. And what's more, your wife has just run off with your best friend.\"And you know that Chris would say, \"Thank you.\" (Laughter) \"Thank you for sharing, that's really interesting.\" (Laughter) \"Thank you for taking me to a place that I didn't know existed. Thank you.\" (Laughter)One of the \u2014 (Applause) Thank you for inviting us. One of the things about appearing later on in the TED week is that, gradually, as the days go by, all the other speakers cover most of what you were going to say. (Laughter) Nuclear fusion, I had about 10 minutes on that. Spectroscopy, that was another one. Parallel universes. And so this morning I thought, \"Oh well, I'll just do a card trick.\" (Laughter) That one's gone as well. And today is Emmanuel's day, I think we've agreed that, already, haven't we? Emmanuel? Absolutely. (Applause) I was planning on finishing on a dance ... (Laughter) So, that's going to look pretty shabby now.So, what I thought I'd do is \u2014 in honor of Emmanuel \u2014 is, what I can do is to launch today the first TED Global auction. If I could start, this is the Enigma decoding machine. (Laughter) Who will start me with $1,000? Anyone?Thank you. Bruno's face, just then, he said, \"No, don't go through this. Don't, please don't. Don't go through this. Don't do it.\" (Laughter)I'm worried. When I first got the invitation, they said somewhere in the thing, they said, \"15 minutes to change the world, your moment onstage.\" 15 minutes to change the world. I don't know about you, it takes me 15 minutes to change a plug. (Laughter) So, the idea of changing the world is really quite an extraordinary one. Well, of course now we know we don't have to change a plug, now we've seen that wonderful demonstration of the wireless electric \u2014 fantastic. You know, it inspires us. 300 years ago he'd have been burnt at the stake for that. (Laughter) And now it's an idea. (Laughter) It's great. It's fantastic. But you do meet some fantastic people, people who look at the world in a totally different way.Yesterday, David Deutsch, another one who covered most of what I was going to say. (Laughter) But when you think of the world in that way, it does make going to Starbucks a whole new experience, don't you think? I mean, he must walk in and they will say, \"Would you like a macchiato, or a latte, or an Americano, or a cappuccino?\" And he'll say, \"You're offering me things that are infinitely variable.\" (Laughter) \"How can your coffee be true?\" (Laughter) And they will say, \"Would you mind if I serve the next customer?\" (Laughter)And Elaine Morgan yesterday, wasn't she wonderful? Fantastic. Really good. Her talk about the aquatic ape, and the link, of course, the link between Darwinism and the fact that we are all naked beneath this \u2014 we're not hirsute and we can swim rather well. And she said, you know, she's 90. She's running out of time, she said. And she's desperate to find more evidence for the link. And I think, \"I'm sitting next to Lewis Pugh.\" (Laughter) This man has swum around the North Pole, what more evidence do you want? (Laughter) And there he is. (Applause) That's how TED brings these connections together.I wasn't here on Tuesday. I didn't actually see Gordon Brown's job application \u2014 um, sorry. (Laughter) I'm so sorry. (Applause) I'm so sorry. No, no. (Applause) No, no, ahh ... (Applause) (As Brown): \"Global problems require Scottish solutions.\" (Laughter) The problem I have is because Gordon Brown, he comes onstage and he looks for all the world like a man who's just taken the head off a bear suit.(As Brown): \"Hello, can I tell you what happened in the woods back there? Uh, no.\" (Laughter) \"I'm sorry. I've only got 18 minutes, 18 minutes to talk about saving the world, saving the planet, global institutions. Our work on climate change, I've only got 18 minutes, unfortunately I'm not able to tell you about all the wonderful things we're doing to promote the climate change agenda in Great Britain, like the third runway we're planning at Heathrow Airport ...\" (Laughter) \"The large coal-fired power station we're building at King's North, and of course the exciting news that only today, only this week, Britain's only manufacturer of wind turbines has been forced to close. No time, unfortunately, to mention those.\" (Applause) \"British jobs for Scottish people ... No.\" (Laughter) \"Christian principles, Christian values. Thou shalt not kill, thou shalt not steal, thou shalt not covet thy neighbor's wife.\" (Laughter) \"Although to be honest, when I was at Number 11 that was never going to be a problem.\" (Laughter)(As Tony Blair): \"Yeah, alright, come on, eh. Alright Gordon, come on, eh. I just, can I just say a few things about, first about Cherie, because she's a wonderful lady, my wife, with a wonderful smile. That reminds me, I must post that letter.\" (Laughter) \"I just think, you know, what people forget, Gordon and I, we always got on perfectly well. Alright, it was never exactly 'Brokeback Mountain.'\" (Laughter) \"You know, I wrote to him, just before I left office. I said, 'Can I rely on your support for the next month?' And he wrote back. He said, 'No, you can't.' Which kind of surprised me, because I'd never seen 'can't' spelled that way before.\" (Laughter)Another thing Gordon could have mentioned in his speech to the Mansion House in 2002 \u2014 that was to the building; the people weren't listening. But the people, when talking about the finance industry, he said, \"What you as the city of London have done for financial services, we, as a government, hope to do for the economy as a whole.\" (Laughter) When you think what's happened to financial services, and you see what's happened to the economy, you think, \"Well, there is a man who delivers on his promises.\" (Laughter)But we're in a new world now. We're in a completely new world. This is the first time that I can remember, where if you get a letter from the bank manager about a loan, you don't know if you're borrowing money from him, or if he's borrowing money from you. Am I right?These extraordinary things, Icelandic Internet accounts. Did anyone here have an Icelandic Internet account? Why would you do that? Why would \u2014 It's like one step up from replying to one of those emails from Nigeria, isn't it? (Laughter) Asking for your bank details. And, you know, Iceland, it was never going to cut it. It didn't have that kind of collateral. What does it have? It has fish, that's all. That's why the Prime Minister went on television. He said, \"This has left us all with a very big haddock.\" (Laughter)A lot of what I do \u2014 I have to try and make sense of things before I can make nonsense of them. And making sense of the financial crisis is very, very difficult. Luckily, somebody like George Bush was really helpful. He summed it up, really, at a dinner. He was speaking at a dinner, he said, \"Wall Street got drunk.\" (Laughter) \"And now it's got a hangover.\" And that's, you know, that's something \u2014 (Applause) And that's something we can relate to. It's certainly something he can relate to. (Laughter)And the other one, of course, is Donald Rumsfeld, who said, \"There are the known knowns, the things we know we know. And then you got the known unknowns, the things we know we don't know. And then you got the unknown unknowns, those are the things we don't know we don't know.\" And being English, when I first heard that I thought, \"What a load of cock.\" And then, you're now, well, actually, that's what this is about.This whole, what Ben Bernanke has said, the chaotic unwinding of the world's financial system, it's about \u2014 they don't know, they didn't know what they were doing. In 2006, the head of the American Mortgage Bankers Association said, quote, \"As we can clearly see, no seismic occurrence is about to overwhelm the U.S. economy.\" Now, there is a man on top of his job. (Laughter) And when the crisis was happening, the head of quantitative equities at Lehman Brothers said, \"Events which models predicted would happen once every 10,000 years happened every day for three days.\"So, it's extraordinary. It's a new world that's very, very difficult to make sense of. But we have a new hope. We have a new man. America has now elected its first openly black President. (Laughter) Wonderful news. Not only that, he's left-handed. Have you noticed this? How many people here are left-handed? You see, a lot of the people that I most admire, they're great artists, great designers, great thinkers, they're left-handed. And somebody said to me last night, you know, being left-handed, you have to learn to write without smudging the ink. And somebody was talking about metaphors on Monday. And I thought, what a wonderful metaphor, isn't it? An American President who has to write without smudging the ink.You like that one? As opposed to you could see George Bush, well, what's the metaphor there? I think it would be something out of the aquatic ape thing, wouldn't it? \"Well, you know I'm sorry about that. I'm right-handed but I seem to have smudged that ink as well.\" (Laughter) But, you know, he's gone. Now he's gone. That's eight years of American History, eight minutes of my act, just gone like that.\"You know, it's the end of an error [sic]. I happen to believe it was a great error. I know folks said to me they believe it was one of the greatest errors in the history of the United States. But we proved them wrong in Iraq. They said there was no link between Iraq and Al Qaeda. There is now.\" (Laughter) \"But I have a message for the suicide bombers, for those people who've blown themselves up.\" (Laughter) \"We're going to find you.\" (Laughter) \"We're going to make sure you don't do it again.\" (Laughter)But now he's gone, and it's great to see one of the \u2014 arguably one of the worst speech makers in American history, now given way to one of the greatest, in Obama. You were there, maybe, on the night of his victory. And he spoke to the crowd in Chicago, he said, \"If there is anyone out there who still doubts that America is a place where all things are possible ...\" I can't do the whole thing because it would take too long, it really would. (Laughter) But you get the picture. And then it goes to the inauguration. And he and the Chief Justice, they trip over each other, they get their words wrong and they screw the thing up. And there is George Bush sitting there going, \"Heh heh heh heh ...\" (Laughter) \"Not so easy is it? Heh heh heh.\" (Laughter)But the interesting thing is, Gordon Brown was talking about Cicero, who said, people would listen to a speech, they said, \"Great speech.\" And then they'd listen to Demosthenes, and they'd say, \"Let's march.\" And we all want to believe in President Obama. It's rather like that line in the film \"As Good As it Gets.\" Do you remember that film with Helen Hunt and Jack Nicholson, and Helen Hunt says to Jack Nicholson, \"What do you see in me?\" And Jack Nicholson just says, \"You make me want to be a better man.\"And you want a leader who inspires and challenges and makes you want to be a better citizen. Right? But at the moment, it's a Cicero thing. We like what Barack Obama says, but we don't do anything about it. So he comes over to this country, and he says, \"We need a big fiscal stimulus.\" And everyone goes, \"Great!\" He leaves the country and the French and the Germans go, \"No, no, forget about that, absolutely not.\" Nothing happens. He goes to Strasburg. He says, \"We need more boots on the ground in Afghanistan.\" And everyone goes, \"Great idea.\" He leaves, people go, \"No no no, we're not going to do that. 5,000 maximum, and no rockets. No, no, not going to do it.\" He goes to Prague, he says, \"We believe in a nuclear-free world.\"And it's great to have an American president who can say the word \"nuclear,\" let's just point that out first. Do you remember that? George Bush, \"A nu-ca-ler.\" Sorry, what? \"A nu-ca-ler.\" (Laughter) Could you say \"avuncular\"? \"Avunclear.\" (Laughter) Thank you very much.But he says, \"We want a nuclear-free world.\" And that day, North Korea, that very day, North Korea is just seeing if it can just get one over Japan \u2014 (Laughter) \u2014 and land it before ...So, where do we look for inspiration? We've still got Bill Clinton. \"Travels the world.\" (Laughs) \"I believe, I believe it was President Dwight D. Eisenhower who said ...\" (Laughter) \"Tell a lie; it was Diana Ross ...\" (Laughter) \"... who said, reach out and touch ...\" (Laughter) \"... somebody's gla \u2014 hand.\" (Laughter) \"Make this world a better place, if you can. I just think that's important. I really do. And I was hoping Hillary would get to the White House, because she'd have been out of our home for four years. And I, you know.\" (Laughter) \"So, when that didn't work out I had to make a few arrangements, let me tell you.\" (Laughter)So, there's him. In Britain we have Prince Charles: \"And the environment is so important, all we can do. My wife gets fed up with me constantly trying to push emissions up her agenda.\" (Laughter)Or, any South Africans, we have Mandela to inspire. Mandela, the great man Mandela. He's been honored with a statue now. The previous highest honor he had in Britain was a visit from the team from Ground Force, a gardening program. \"So, Nelson, how would you like a nice water feature?\" \"Ahh, listen to me Mr. Titchmarsh.\" (Laughter) \"I was held in prison for nearly 30 years on an island in the middle of the ocean. Why would I need a bloody water feature?\" (Laughter)Very quickly: I wasn't quite sure how to end this talk and then yesterday that man came up with a wonderful quote from the \"Japanese Essays on Idleness\" which said it's nice to have something which is unfinished because it implies there is still room for growth. Thank you very much indeed.

When I first got the invitation,\n\n00:01:53.958 --> 00:01:55.958\nthey said somewhere in the thing, they said, \"15 minutes to change the world,\n\n00:01:55.958 --> 00:01:58.958\nyour moment onstage.\" 15 minutes to change the world.\n\n00:01:58.958 --> 00:02:00.958\nI don't know about you, it takes me 15 minutes to change a plug.\n\n00:02:00.958 --> 00:02:01.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:02:01.958 --> 00:02:05.958\nSo, the idea of changing the world is really quite an extraordinary one.\n\n00:02:05.958 --> 00:02:07.958\nWell, of course now we know we don't have to change a plug,\n\n00:02:07.958 --> 00:02:09.958\nnow we've seen that wonderful demonstration\n\n00:02:09.958 --> 00:02:12.958\nof the wireless electric -- fantastic. You know, it inspires us.\n\n00:02:12.958 --> 00:02:15.958\n300 years ago he'd have been burnt at the stake for that.\n\n00:02:15.958 --> 00:02:16.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:02:16.958 --> 00:02:18.958\nAnd now it's an idea.\n\n00:02:18.958 --> 00:02:19.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:02:19.958 --> 00:02:21.958\nIt's great. It's fantastic.\n\n00:02:21.958 --> 00:02:23.958\nBut you do meet some fantastic people,\n\n00:02:23.958 --> 00:02:25.958\npeople who look at the world in a totally different way.\n\n00:02:25.958 --> 00:02:27.958\nYesterday, David Deutsch, another one\n\n00:02:27.958 --> 00:02:29.958\nwho covered most of what I was going to say.\n\n00:02:29.958 --> 00:02:31.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:02:31.958 --> 00:02:33.958\nBut when you think of the world in that way,\n\n00:02:33.958 --> 00:02:36.958\nit does make going to Starbucks a whole new experience, don't you think?\n\n00:02:36.958 --> 00:02:38.958\nI mean, he must walk in and they will say,\n\n00:02:38.958 --> 00:02:40.958\n\"Would you like a macchiato,\n\n00:02:40.958 --> 00:02:42.958\nor a latte, or an Americano,\n\n00:02:42.958 --> 00:02:44.958\nor a cappuccino?\"\n\n00:02:44.958 --> 00:02:46.958\nAnd he'll say,\n\n00:02:46.958 --> 00:02:49.958\n\"You're offering me things that are infinitely variable.\"\n\n00:02:49.958 --> 00:02:51.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:02:51.958 --> 00:02:53.958\n\"How can your coffee be true?\"\n\n00:02:53.958 --> 00:02:55.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:02:55.958 --> 00:02:57.958\nAnd they will say,\n\n00:02:57.958 --> 00:02:59.958\n\"Would you mind if I serve the next customer?\"\n\n00:02:59.958 --> 00:03:01.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:03:01.958 --> 00:03:03.958\nAnd Elaine Morgan yesterday, wasn't she wonderful?\n\n00:03:03.958 --> 00:03:05.958\nFantastic.

She's running out of time, she said.\n\n00:03:17.958 --> 00:03:20.958\nAnd she's desperate to find more evidence for the link.\n\n00:03:20.958 --> 00:03:22.958\nAnd I think, \"I'm sitting next to Lewis Pugh.\"\n\n00:03:22.958 --> 00:03:23.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:03:23.958 --> 00:03:27.958\nThis man has swum around the North Pole, what more evidence do you want?\n\n00:03:27.958 --> 00:03:29.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:03:29.958 --> 00:03:31.958\nAnd there he is.\n\n00:03:31.958 --> 00:03:32.958\n(Applause)\n\n00:03:32.958 --> 00:03:34.958\nThat's how TED brings these connections together.\n\n00:03:34.958 --> 00:03:36.958\nI wasn't here on Tuesday.

He goes to Strasburg.\n\n00:11:45.958 --> 00:11:49.958\nHe says, \"We need more boots on the ground in Afghanistan.\"\n\n00:11:49.958 --> 00:11:51.958\nAnd everyone goes, \"Great idea.\"\n\n00:11:51.958 --> 00:11:53.958\nHe leaves, people go, \"No no no, we're not going to do that.\n\n00:11:53.958 --> 00:11:56.958\n5,000 maximum, and no rockets. No, no, not going to do it.\"\n\n00:11:56.958 --> 00:11:59.958\nHe goes to Prague, he says, \"We believe in a nuclear-free world.\"\n\n00:11:59.958 --> 00:12:02.958\nAnd it's great to have an American president who can say the word \"nuclear,\"\n\n00:12:02.958 --> 00:12:04.958\nlet's just point that out first.\n\n00:12:04.958 --> 00:12:06.958\nDo you remember that? George Bush, \"A nu-ca-ler.\"\n\n00:12:06.958 --> 00:12:09.958\nSorry, what? \"A nu-ca-ler.\"\n\n00:12:09.958 --> 00:12:10.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:12:10.958 --> 00:12:13.958\nCould you say \"avuncular\"? \"Avunclear.\"\n\n00:12:13.958 --> 00:12:14.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:12:14.958 --> 00:12:16.958\nThank you very much.\n\n00:12:16.958 --> 00:12:18.958\nBut he says, \"We want a nuclear-free world.\"\n\n00:12:18.958 --> 00:12:20.958\nAnd that day, North Korea, that very day,\n\n00:12:20.958 --> 00:12:22.958\nNorth Korea is just seeing if it can\n\n00:12:22.958 --> 00:12:25.958\njust get one over Japan --\n\n00:12:25.958 --> 00:12:26.958\n(Laughter) --\n\n00:12:26.958 --> 00:12:28.958\nand land it before ...\n\n00:12:28.958 --> 00:12:31.958\nSo, where do we look for inspiration? We've still got Bill Clinton.\n\n00:12:31.958 --> 00:12:34.958\n\"Travels the world.\" (Laughs)\n\n00:12:34.958 --> 00:12:41.958\n\"I believe, I believe it was President Dwight D. Eisenhower who said ...\"\n\n00:12:41.958 --> 00:12:42.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:12:42.958 --> 00:12:44.958\n\"Tell a lie; it was Diana Ross ...\"\n\n00:12:44.958 --> 00:12:45.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:12:45.958 --> 00:12:48.958\n\"... who said, reach out and touch ...\"\n\n00:12:48.958 --> 00:12:50.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:12:50.958 --> 00:12:52.958\n\"... somebody's gla -- hand.\"\n\n00:12:52.958 --> 00:12:54.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:12:54.958 --> 00:12:57.958\n\"Make this world a better place, if you can.\n\n00:12:57.958 --> 00:13:00.958\nI just think that's important. I really do.\n\n00:13:00.958 --> 00:13:02.958\nAnd I was hoping Hillary would get to the White House,\n\n00:13:02.958 --> 00:13:04.958\nbecause she'd have been out of our home for four years.\n\n00:13:04.958 --> 00:13:06.958\nAnd I, you know.\" (Laughter)\n\n00:13:06.958 --> 00:13:09.958\n\"So, when that didn't work out I had to make a few arrangements, let me tell you.\"\n\n00:13:09.958 --> 00:13:11.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:13:11.958 --> 00:13:13.958\nSo, there's him. In Britain we have Prince Charles:\n\n00:13:13.958 --> 00:13:16.958\n\"And the environment is so important, all we can do.\n\n00:13:16.958 --> 00:13:19.958\nMy wife gets fed up with me constantly trying to\n\n00:13:19.958 --> 00:13:21.958\npush emissions up her agenda.\"\n\n00:13:21.958 --> 00:13:23.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:13:23.958 --> 00:13:28.958\nOr, any South Africans, we have Mandela to inspire.\n\n00:13:28.958 --> 00:13:30.958\nMandela, the great man Mandela.\n\n00:13:30.958 --> 00:13:32.958\nHe's been honored with a statue now.\n\n00:13:32.958 --> 00:13:34.958\nThe previous highest honor he had in Britain\n\n00:13:34.958 --> 00:13:37.958\nwas a visit from the team from Ground Force, a gardening program.\n\n00:13:37.958 --> 00:13:41.958\n\"So, Nelson, how would you like a nice water feature?\"\n\n00:13:41.958 --> 00:13:45.958\n\"Ahh, listen to me Mr. Titchmarsh.\"\n\n00:13:45.958 --> 00:13:47.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:13:47.958 --> 00:13:52.958\n\"I was held in prison\n\n00:13:52.958 --> 00:13:55.958\nfor nearly 30 years\n\n00:13:55.958 --> 00:13:57.958\non an island\n\n00:13:57.958 --> 00:14:00.958\nin the middle of the ocean.\n\n00:14:00.958 --> 00:14:03.958\nWhy would I need a bloody water feature?\"\n\n00:14:03.958 --> 00:14:05.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:14:05.958 --> 00:14:09.958\nVery quickly: I wasn't quite sure how to end this talk\n\n00:14:09.958 --> 00:14:12.958\nand then yesterday that man came up with a wonderful quote\n\n00:14:12.958 --> 00:14:14.958\nfrom the \"Japanese Essays on Idleness\"\n\n00:14:14.958 --> 00:14:16.958\nwhich said it's nice to have something which is unfinished\n\n00:14:16.958 --> 00:14:19.958\nbecause it implies there is still room for growth.\n\n00:14:19.958 --> 00:14:21.958\nThank you very much indeed.\n\n00:14:21.958 --> 00:14:31.958\n(Applause)"}, {"title": "The art of the interview", "duration": "1254", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/marc_pachter_the_art_of_the_interview", "transcript": "The National Portrait Gallery is the place dedicated to presenting great American lives, amazing people. And that's what it's about. We use portraiture as a way to deliver those lives, but that's it. And so I'm not going to talk about the painted portrait today. I'm going to talk about a program I started there, which, from my point of view, is the proudest thing I did.I started to worry about the fact that a lot of people don't get their portraits painted anymore, and they're amazing people, and we want to deliver them to future generations. So, how do we do that? And so I came up with the idea of the living self-portrait series. And the living self-portrait series was the idea of basically my being a brush in the hand of amazing people who would come and I would interview.And so what I'm going to do is, not so much give you the great hits of that program, as to give you this whole notion of how you encounter people in that kind of situation, what you try to find out about them, and when people deliver and when they don't and why.Now, I had two preconditions. One was that they be American. That's just because, in the nature of the National Portrait Gallery, it's created to look at American lives. That was easy, but then I made the decision, maybe arbitrary, that they needed to be people of a certain age, which at that point, when I created this program, seemed really old. Sixties, seventies, eighties and nineties. For obvious reasons, it doesn't seem that old anymore to me.And why did I do that? Well, for one thing, we're a youth-obsessed culture. And I thought really what we need is an elders program to just sit at the feet of amazing people and hear them talk. But the second part of it \u2014 and the older I get, the more convinced I am that that's true. It's amazing what people will say when they know how the story turned out. That's the one advantage that older people have. Well, they have other, little bit of advantage, but they also have some disadvantages, but the one thing they or we have is that we've reached the point in life where we know how the story turned out. So, we can then go back in our lives, if we've got an interviewer who gets that, and begin to reflect on how we got there. All of those accidents that wound up creating the life narrative that we inherited.So, I thought okay, now, what is it going to take to make this work? There are many kinds of interviews. We know them. There are the journalist interviews, which are the interrogation that is expected. This is somewhat against resistance and caginess on the part of the interviewee. Then there's the celebrity interview, where it's more important who's asking the question than who answers. That's Barbara Walters and others like that, and we like that. That's Frost-Nixon, where Frost seems to be as important as Nixon in that process. Fair enough.But I wanted interviews that were different. I wanted to be, as I later thought of it, empathic, which is to say, to feel what they wanted to say and to be an agent of their self-revelation. By the way, this was always done in public. This was not an oral history program. This was all about 300 people sitting at the feet of this individual, and having me be the brush in their self-portrait.Now, it turns out that I was pretty good at that. I didn't know it coming into it. And the only reason I really know that is because of one interview I did with Senator William Fulbright, and that was six months after he'd had a stroke. And he had never appeared in public since that point. This was not a devastating stroke, but it did affect his speaking and so forth. And I thought it was worth a chance, he thought it was worth a chance, and so we got up on the stage, and we had an hour conversation about his life, and after that a woman rushed up to me, essentially did, and she said, \"Where did you train as a doctor?\"And I said, \"I have no training as a doctor. I never claimed that.\"And she said, \"Well, something very weird was happening. When he started a sentence, particularly in the early parts of the interview, and paused, you gave him the word, the bridge to get to the end of the sentence, and by the end of it, he was speaking complete sentences on his own.\" I didn't know what was going on, but I was so part of the process of getting that out.So I thought, okay, fine, I've got empathy, or empathy, at any rate, is what's critical to this kind of interview. But then I began to think of other things. Who makes a great interview in this context? It had nothing to do with their intellect, the quality of their intellect. Some of them were very brilliant, some of them were, you know, ordinary people who would never claim to be intellectuals, but it was never about that. It was about their energy. It's energy that creates extraordinary interviews and extraordinary lives. I'm convinced of it. And it had nothing to do with the energy of being young. These were people through their 90s.In fact, the first person I interviewed was George Abbott, who was 97, and Abbott was filled with the life force \u2014 I guess that's the way I think about it \u2014 filled with it. And so he filled the room, and we had an extraordinary conversation. He was supposed to be the toughest interview that anybody would ever do because he was famous for being silent, for never ever saying anything except maybe a word or two. And, in fact, he did wind up opening up \u2014 by the way, his energy is evidenced in other ways. He subsequently got married again at 102, so he, you know, he had a lot of the life force in him.But after the interview, I got a call, very gruff voice, from a woman. I didn't know who she was, and she said, \"Did you get George Abbott to talk?\"And I said, \"Yeah. Apparently I did.\"And she said, \"I'm his old girlfriend, Maureen Stapleton, and I could never do it.\" And then she made me go up with the tape of it and prove that George Abbott actually could talk.So, you know, you want energy, you want the life force, but you really want them also to think that they have a story worth sharing. The worst interviews that you can ever have are with people who are modest. Never ever get up on a stage with somebody who's modest, because all of these people have been assembled to listen to them, and they sit there and they say, \"Aw, shucks, it was an accident.\" There's nothing that ever happens that justifies people taking good hours of the day to be with them.The worst interview I ever did: William L. Shirer. The journalist who did \"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich.\" This guy had met Hitler and Gandhi within six months, and every time I'd ask him about it, he'd say, \"Oh, I just happened to be there. Didn't matter.\" Whatever. Awful. I never would ever agree to interview a modest person. They have to think that they did something and that they want to share it with you.But it comes down, in the end, to how do you get through all the barriers we have. All of us are public and private beings, and if all you're going to get from the interviewee is their public self, there's no point in it. It's pre-programmed. It's infomercial, and we all have infomercials about our lives. We know the great lines, we know the great moments, we know what we're not going to share, and the point of this was not to embarrass anybody. This wasn't \u2014 and some of you will remember Mike Wallace's old interviews \u2014 tough, aggressive and so forth. They have their place.I was trying to get them to say what they probably wanted to say, to break out of their own cocoon of the public self, and the more public they had been, the more entrenched that person, that outer person was. And let me tell you at once the worse moment and the best moment that happened in this interview series. It all has to do with that shell that most of us have, and particularly certain people.There's an extraordinary woman named Clare Boothe Luce. It'll be your generational determinant as to whether her name means much to you. She did so much. She was a playwright. She did an extraordinary play called \"The Women.\" She was a congresswoman when there weren't very many congresswomen. She was editor of Vanity Fair, one of the great phenomenal women of her day. And, incidentally, I call her the Eleanor Roosevelt of the Right. She was sort of adored on the Right the way Eleanor Roosevelt was on the Left. And, in fact, when we did the interview \u2014 I did the living self-portrait with her \u2014 there were three former directors of the CIA basically sitting at her feet, just enjoying her presence.And I thought, this is going to be a piece of cake, because I always have preliminary talks with these people for just maybe 10 or 15 minutes. We never talk before that because if you talk before, you don't get it on the stage. So she and I had a delightful conversation.We were on the stage and then \u2014 by the way, spectacular. It was all part of Clare Boothe Luce's look. She was in a great evening gown. She was 80, almost that day of the interview, and there she was and there I was, and I just proceeded into the questions. And she stonewalled me. It was unbelievable. Anything that I would ask, she would turn around, dismiss, and I was basically up there \u2014 any of you in the moderate-to-full entertainment world know what it is to die onstage. And I was dying. She was absolutely not giving me a thing.And I began to wonder what was going on, and you think while you talk, and basically, I thought, I got it. When we were alone, I was her audience. Now I'm her competitor for the audience. That's the problem here, and she's fighting me for that, and so then I asked her a question \u2014 I didn't know how I was going to get out of it \u2014 I asked her a question about her days as a playwright, and again, characteristically, instead of saying, \"Oh yes, I was a playwright, and this is what blah blah blah,\" she said, \"Oh, playwright. Everybody knows I was a playwright. Most people think that I was an actress. I was never an actress.\" But I hadn't asked that, and then she went off on a tear, and she said, \"Oh, well, there was that one time that I was an actress. It was for a charity in Connecticut when I was a congresswoman, and I got up there,\" and she went on and on, \"And then I got on the stage.\"And then she turned to me and said, \"And you know what those young actors did? They upstaged me.\" And she said, \"Do you know what that is?\" Just withering in her contempt.And I said, \"I'm learning.\"(Laughter)And she looked at me, and it was like the successful arm-wrestle, and then, after that, she delivered an extraordinary account of what her life really was like.I have to end that one. This is my tribute to Clare Boothe Luce. Again, a remarkable person. I'm not politically attracted to her, but through her life force, I'm attracted to her. And the way she died \u2014 she had, toward the end, a brain tumor. That's probably as terrible a way to die as you can imagine, and very few of us were invited to a dinner party.And she was in horrible pain. We all knew that. She stayed in her room. Everybody came. The butler passed around canapes. The usual sort of thing. Then at a certain moment, the door opened and she walked out perfectly dressed, completely composed. The public self, the beauty, the intellect, and she walked around and talked to every person there and then went back into the room and was never seen again. She wanted the control of her final moment, and she did it amazingly.Now, there are other ways that you get somebody to open up, and this is just a brief reference. It wasn't this arm-wrestle, but it was a little surprising for the person involved. I interviewed Steve Martin. It wasn't all that long ago. And we were sitting there, and almost toward the beginning of the interview, I turned to him and I said, \"Steve,\" or \"Mr. Martin, it is said that all comedians have unhappy childhoods. Was yours unhappy?\"And he looked at me, you know, as if to say, \"This is how you're going to start this thing, right off?\" And then he turned to me, not stupidly, and he said, \"What was your childhood like?\"And I said \u2014 these are all arm wrestles, but they're affectionate \u2014 and I said, \"My father was loving and supportive, which is why I'm not funny.\"(Laughter)And he looked at me, and then we heard the big sad story. His father was an SOB, and, in fact, he was another comedian with an unhappy childhood, but then we were off and running. So the question is: What is the key that's going to allow this to proceed?Now, these are arm wrestle questions, but I want to tell you about questions that are more related to empathy and that really, very often, are the questions that people have been waiting their whole lives to be asked. And I'll just give you two examples of this because of the time constraints.One was an interview I did with one of the great American biographers. Again, some of you will know him, most of you won't, Dumas Malone. He did a five-volume biography of Thomas Jefferson, spent virtually his whole life with Thomas Jefferson, and by the way, at one point I asked him, \"Would you like to have met him?\"And he said, \"Well, of course, but actually, I know him better than anyone who ever met him, because I got to read all of his letters.\" So, he was very satisfied with the kind of relationship they had over 50 years.And I asked him one question. I said, \"Did Jefferson ever disappoint you?\"And here is this man who had given his whole life to uncovering Jefferson and connecting with him, and he said, \"Well ...\" \u2014 I'm going to do a bad southern accent. Dumas Malone was from Mississippi originally. But he said, \"Well,\" he said, \"I'm afraid so.\" He said, \"You know, I've read everything, and sometimes Mr. Jefferson would smooth the truth a bit.\"And he basically was saying that this was a man who lied more than he wished he had, because he saw the letters. He said, \"But I understand that.\" He said, \"I understand that.\" He said, \"We southerners do like a smooth surface, so that there were times when he just didn't want the confrontation.\"And he said, \"Now, John Adams was too honest.\" And he started to talk about that, and later on he invited me to his house, and I met his wife who was from Massachusetts, and he and she had exactly the relationship of Thomas Jefferson and John Adams. She was the New Englander and abrasive, and he was this courtly fellow.But really the most important question I ever asked, and most of the times when I talk about it, people kind of suck in their breath at my audacity, or cruelty, but I promise you it was the right question. This was to Agnes de Mille. Agnes de Mille is one of the great choreographers in our history. She basically created the dances in \"Oklahoma,\" transforming the American theater. An amazing woman.At the time that I proposed to her that \u2014 by the way, I would have proposed to her; she was extraordinary \u2014 but proposed to her that she come on. She said, \"Come to my apartment.\" She lived in New York. \"Come to my apartment and we'll talk for those 15 minutes, and then we'll decide whether we proceed.\"And so I showed up in this dark, rambling New York apartment, and she called out to me, and she was in bed. I had known that she had had a stroke, and that was some 10 years before. And so she spent almost all of her life in bed, but \u2014 I speak of the life force \u2014 her hair was askew. She wasn't about to make up for this occasion.And she was sitting there surrounded by books, and her most interesting possession she felt at that moment was her will, which she had by her side. She wasn't unhappy about this. She was resigned. She said, \"I keep this will by my bed, memento mori, and I change it all the time just because I want to.\" And she was loving the prospect of death as much as she had loved life. I thought, this is somebody I've got to get in this series.She agreed. She came on. Of course she was wheelchaired on. Half of her body was stricken, the other half not. She was, of course, done up for the occasion, but this was a woman in great physical distress. And we had a conversation, and then I asked her this unthinkable question. I said, \"Was it a problem for you in your life that you were not beautiful?\"And the audience just \u2014 you know, they're always on the side of the interviewee, and they felt that this was a kind of assault, but this was the question she had wanted somebody to ask her whole life. And she began to talk about her childhood, when she was beautiful, and she literally turned \u2014 here she was, in this broken body \u2014 and she turned to the audience and described herself as the fair demoiselle with her red hair and her light steps and so forth, and then she said, \"And then puberty hit.\"And she began to talk about things that had happened to her body and her face, and how she could no longer count on her beauty, and her family then treated her like the ugly sister of the beautiful one for whom all the ballet lessons were given. And she had to go along just to be with her sister for company, and in that process, she made a number of decisions. First of all, was that dance, even though it hadn't been offered to her, was her life. And secondly, she had better be, although she did dance for a while, a choreographer because then her looks didn't matter. But she was thrilled to get that out as a real, real fact in her life.It was an amazing privilege to do this series. There were other moments like that, very few moments of silence. The key point was empathy because everybody in their lives is really waiting for people to ask them questions, so that they can be truthful about who they are and how they became what they are, and I commend that to you, even if you're not doing interviews. Just be that way with your friends and particularly the older members of your family.Thank you very much.", "id": 708, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:11.958 --> 00:00:15.958\nThe National Portrait Gallery is the place dedicated\n\n00:00:15.958 --> 00:00:17.958\nto presenting great American lives,\n\n00:00:17.958 --> 00:00:19.958\namazing people.\n\n00:00:19.958 --> 00:00:21.958\nAnd that's what it's about.\n\n00:00:21.958 --> 00:00:25.958\nWe use portraiture as a way to deliver those lives, but that's it.\n\n00:00:25.958 --> 00:00:29.958\nAnd so I'm not going to talk about the painted portrait today.\n\n00:00:29.958 --> 00:00:32.958\nI'm going to talk about a program I started there,\n\n00:00:32.958 --> 00:00:37.958\nwhich, from my point of view, is the proudest thing I did.\n\n00:00:37.958 --> 00:00:41.958\nI started to worry about the fact\n\n00:00:41.958 --> 00:00:44.958\nthat a lot of people don't get their portraits painted anymore,\n\n00:00:44.958 --> 00:00:46.958\nand they're amazing people,\n\n00:00:46.958 --> 00:00:49.958\nand we want to deliver them to future generations.\n\n00:00:49.958 --> 00:00:51.958\nSo, how do we do that?\n\n00:00:51.958 --> 00:00:53.958\nAnd so I came up with the idea of the living self-portrait series.\n\n00:00:53.958 --> 00:00:57.958\nAnd the living self-portrait series was the idea of basically\n\n00:00:57.958 --> 00:00:59.958\nmy being a brush in the hand\n\n00:00:59.958 --> 00:01:02.958\nof amazing people who would come and I would interview.\n\n00:01:02.958 --> 00:01:05.958\nAnd so what I'm going to do is, not so much give you\n\n00:01:05.958 --> 00:01:07.958\nthe great hits of that program,\n\n00:01:07.958 --> 00:01:09.958\nas to give you this whole notion\n\n00:01:09.958 --> 00:01:12.958\nof how you encounter people in that kind of situation,\n\n00:01:12.958 --> 00:01:14.958\nwhat you try to find out about them,\n\n00:01:14.958 --> 00:01:18.958\nand when people deliver and when they don't and why.\n\n00:01:19.958 --> 00:01:22.958\nNow, I had two preconditions.\n\n00:01:22.958 --> 00:01:24.958\nOne was that they be American.\n\n00:01:24.958 --> 00:01:27.958\nThat's just because, in the nature of the National Portrait Gallery,\n\n00:01:27.958 --> 00:01:30.958\nit's created to look at American lives.\n\n00:01:30.958 --> 00:01:33.958\nThat was easy, but then I made the decision,\n\n00:01:33.958 --> 00:01:35.958\nmaybe arbitrary,\n\n00:01:35.958 --> 00:01:39.958\nthat they needed to be people of a certain age,\n\n00:01:39.958 --> 00:01:41.958\nwhich at that point, when I created this program,\n\n00:01:41.958 --> 00:01:43.958\nseemed really old.\n\n00:01:43.958 --> 00:01:46.958\nSixties, seventies, eighties and nineties.\n\n00:01:46.958 --> 00:01:48.958\nFor obvious reasons, it doesn't seem that old anymore to me.\n\n00:01:48.958 --> 00:01:50.958\nAnd why did I do that?\n\n00:01:50.958 --> 00:01:52.958\nWell, for one thing, we're a youth-obsessed culture.\n\n00:01:52.958 --> 00:01:56.958\nAnd I thought really what we need is an elders program\n\n00:01:56.958 --> 00:02:00.958\nto just sit at the feet of amazing people and hear them talk.\n\n00:02:00.958 --> 00:02:04.958\nBut the second part of it -- and the older I get,\n\n00:02:04.958 --> 00:02:07.958\nthe more convinced I am that that's true.\n\n00:02:07.958 --> 00:02:10.958\nIt's amazing what people will say when they know\n\n00:02:10.958 --> 00:02:12.958\nhow the story turned out.\n\n00:02:12.958 --> 00:02:16.958\nThat's the one advantage that older people have.\n\n00:02:16.958 --> 00:02:18.958\nWell, they have other, little bit of advantage,\n\n00:02:18.958 --> 00:02:20.958\nbut they also have some disadvantages,\n\n00:02:20.958 --> 00:02:22.958\nbut the one thing they or we have is that\n\n00:02:22.958 --> 00:02:24.958\nwe've reached the point in life\n\n00:02:24.958 --> 00:02:27.958\nwhere we know how the story turned out.\n\n00:02:27.958 --> 00:02:29.958\nSo, we can then go back in our lives,\n\n00:02:29.958 --> 00:02:32.958\nif we've got an interviewer who gets that,\n\n00:02:32.958 --> 00:02:36.958\nand begin to reflect on how we got there.\n\n00:02:36.958 --> 00:02:39.958\nAll of those accidents that wound up\n\n00:02:39.958 --> 00:02:42.958\ncreating the life narrative that we inherited.\n\n00:02:42.958 --> 00:02:44.958\nSo, I thought okay, now,\n\n00:02:44.958 --> 00:02:47.958\nwhat is it going to take to make this work?\n\n00:02:47.958 --> 00:02:49.958\nThere are many kinds of interviews. We know them.\n\n00:02:49.958 --> 00:02:51.958\nThere are the journalist interviews,\n\n00:02:51.958 --> 00:02:53.958\nwhich are the interrogation that is expected.\n\n00:02:53.958 --> 00:02:55.958\nThis is somewhat against resistance\n\n00:02:55.958 --> 00:02:59.958\nand caginess on the part of the interviewee.\n\n00:02:59.958 --> 00:03:01.958\nThen there's the celebrity interview,\n\n00:03:01.958 --> 00:03:04.958\nwhere it's more important who's asking the question than who answers.\n\n00:03:04.958 --> 00:03:08.958\nThat's Barbara Walters and others like that, and we like that.\n\n00:03:08.958 --> 00:03:11.958\nThat's Frost-Nixon, where Frost seems to be as important\n\n00:03:11.958 --> 00:03:13.958\nas Nixon in that process.\n\n00:03:13.958 --> 00:03:15.958\nFair enough.\n\n00:03:15.958 --> 00:03:17.958\nBut I wanted interviews that were different.\n\n00:03:17.958 --> 00:03:24.958\nI wanted to be, as I later thought of it, empathic,\n\n00:03:24.958 --> 00:03:29.958\nwhich is to say, to feel what they wanted to say\n\n00:03:29.958 --> 00:03:33.958\nand to be an agent of their self-revelation.\n\n00:03:33.958 --> 00:03:35.958\nBy the way, this was always done in public.\n\n00:03:35.958 --> 00:03:37.958\nThis was not an oral history program.\n\n00:03:37.958 --> 00:03:42.958\nThis was all about 300 people sitting at the feet of this individual,\n\n00:03:42.958 --> 00:03:46.958\nand having me be the brush in their self-portrait.\n\n00:03:46.958 --> 00:03:49.958\nNow, it turns out that I was pretty good at that.\n\n00:03:49.958 --> 00:03:51.958\nI didn't know it coming into it.\n\n00:03:51.958 --> 00:03:53.958\nAnd the only reason I really know that\n\n00:03:53.958 --> 00:03:58.958\nis because of one interview I did with Senator William Fulbright,\n\n00:03:58.958 --> 00:04:02.958\nand that was six months after he'd had a stroke.\n\n00:04:02.958 --> 00:04:04.958\nAnd he had never appeared in public since that point.\n\n00:04:04.958 --> 00:04:06.958\nThis was not a devastating stroke,\n\n00:04:06.958 --> 00:04:09.958\nbut it did affect his speaking and so forth.\n\n00:04:09.958 --> 00:04:11.958\nAnd I thought it was worth a chance,\n\n00:04:11.958 --> 00:04:13.958\nhe thought it was worth a chance,\n\n00:04:13.958 --> 00:04:15.958\nand so we got up on the stage,\n\n00:04:15.958 --> 00:04:18.958\nand we had an hour conversation about his life,\n\n00:04:18.958 --> 00:04:21.958\nand after that a woman rushed up to me,\n\n00:04:21.958 --> 00:04:23.958\nessentially did,\n\n00:04:23.958 --> 00:04:26.958\nand she said, \"Where did you train as a doctor?\"\n\n00:04:26.958 --> 00:04:30.958\nAnd I said, \"I have no training as a doctor. I never claimed that.\"\n\n00:04:30.958 --> 00:04:34.958\nAnd she said, \"Well, something very weird was happening.\n\n00:04:34.958 --> 00:04:36.958\nWhen he started a sentence, particularly\n\n00:04:36.958 --> 00:04:39.958\nin the early parts of the interview,\n\n00:04:39.958 --> 00:04:41.958\nand paused, you gave him the word,\n\n00:04:41.958 --> 00:04:44.958\nthe bridge to get to the end of the sentence,\n\n00:04:44.958 --> 00:04:46.958\nand by the end of it,\n\n00:04:46.958 --> 00:04:49.958\nhe was speaking complete sentences on his own.\"\n\n00:04:49.958 --> 00:04:51.958\nI didn't know what was going on,\n\n00:04:51.958 --> 00:04:54.958\nbut I was so part of the process of getting that out.\n\n00:04:54.958 --> 00:04:58.958\nSo I thought, okay, fine, I've got empathy,\n\n00:04:58.958 --> 00:05:00.958\nor empathy, at any rate,\n\n00:05:00.958 --> 00:05:02.958\nis what's critical to this kind of interview.\n\n00:05:02.958 --> 00:05:04.958\nBut then I began to think of other things.\n\n00:05:04.958 --> 00:05:08.958\nWho makes a great interview in this context?\n\n00:05:08.958 --> 00:05:10.958\nIt had nothing to do with their intellect,\n\n00:05:10.958 --> 00:05:12.958\nthe quality of their intellect.\n\n00:05:12.958 --> 00:05:14.958\nSome of them were very brilliant,\n\n00:05:14.958 --> 00:05:16.958\nsome of them were,\n\n00:05:16.958 --> 00:05:19.958\nyou know, ordinary people who would never claim to be intellectuals,\n\n00:05:19.958 --> 00:05:22.958\nbut it was never about that.\n\n00:05:22.958 --> 00:05:25.958\nIt was about their energy.\n\n00:05:25.958 --> 00:05:28.958\nIt's energy that creates extraordinary interviews\n\n00:05:28.958 --> 00:05:30.958\nand extraordinary lives.\n\n00:05:30.958 --> 00:05:32.958\nI'm convinced of it.\n\n00:05:32.958 --> 00:05:35.958\nAnd it had nothing to do with the energy of being young.\n\n00:05:35.958 --> 00:05:37.958\nThese were people through their 90s.\n\n00:05:37.958 --> 00:05:39.958\nIn fact, the first person I interviewed\n\n00:05:39.958 --> 00:05:42.958\nwas George Abbott, who was 97,\n\n00:05:42.958 --> 00:05:45.958\nand Abbott was filled with the life force --\n\n00:05:45.958 --> 00:05:47.958\nI guess that's the way I think about it -- filled with it.\n\n00:05:47.958 --> 00:05:49.958\nAnd so he filled the room,\n\n00:05:49.958 --> 00:05:52.958\nand we had an extraordinary conversation.\n\n00:05:52.958 --> 00:05:55.958\nHe was supposed to be the toughest interview that anybody would ever do\n\n00:05:55.958 --> 00:05:59.958\nbecause he was famous for being silent,\n\n00:05:59.958 --> 00:06:01.958\nfor never ever saying anything\n\n00:06:01.958 --> 00:06:03.958\nexcept maybe a word or two.\n\n00:06:03.958 --> 00:06:05.958\nAnd, in fact, he did wind up opening up --\n\n00:06:05.958 --> 00:06:09.958\nby the way, his energy is evidenced in other ways.\n\n00:06:09.958 --> 00:06:12.958\nHe subsequently got married again at 102,\n\n00:06:12.958 --> 00:06:16.958\nso he, you know, he had a lot of the life force in him.\n\n00:06:16.958 --> 00:06:18.958\nBut after the interview, I got a call,\n\n00:06:18.958 --> 00:06:22.958\nvery gruff voice, from a woman.\n\n00:06:22.958 --> 00:06:24.958\nI didn't know who she was,\n\n00:06:24.958 --> 00:06:28.958\nand she said, \"Did you get George Abbott to talk?\"\n\n00:06:28.958 --> 00:06:31.958\nAnd I said, \"Yeah. Apparently I did.\"\n\n00:06:31.958 --> 00:06:35.958\nAnd she said, \"I'm his old girlfriend, Maureen Stapleton,\n\n00:06:35.958 --> 00:06:37.958\nand I could never do it.\"\n\n00:06:37.958 --> 00:06:40.958\nAnd then she made me go up with the tape of it\n\n00:06:40.958 --> 00:06:43.958\nand prove that George Abbott actually could talk.\n\n00:06:43.958 --> 00:06:45.958\nSo, you know, you want energy,\n\n00:06:45.958 --> 00:06:47.958\nyou want the life force,\n\n00:06:47.958 --> 00:06:51.958\nbut you really want them also to think\n\n00:06:51.958 --> 00:06:55.958\nthat they have a story worth sharing.\n\n00:06:55.958 --> 00:06:58.958\nThe worst interviews that you can ever have\n\n00:06:58.958 --> 00:07:01.958\nare with people who are modest.\n\n00:07:01.958 --> 00:07:04.958\nNever ever get up on a stage with somebody who's modest,\n\n00:07:04.958 --> 00:07:07.958\nbecause all of these people have been assembled\n\n00:07:07.958 --> 00:07:09.958\nto listen to them, and they sit there and they say,\n\n00:07:09.958 --> 00:07:11.958\n\"Aw, shucks, it was an accident.\"\n\n00:07:11.958 --> 00:07:15.958\nThere's nothing that ever happens that justifies\n\n00:07:15.958 --> 00:07:19.958\npeople taking good hours of the day to be with them.\n\n00:07:19.958 --> 00:07:22.958\nThe worst interview I ever did: William L. Shirer.\n\n00:07:22.958 --> 00:07:27.958\nThe journalist who did \"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich.\"\n\n00:07:27.958 --> 00:07:31.958\nThis guy had met Hitler and Gandhi within six months,\n\n00:07:31.958 --> 00:07:34.958\nand every time I'd ask him about it, he'd say, \"Oh, I just happened to be there.\n\n00:07:34.958 --> 00:07:37.958\nDidn't matter.\" Whatever.\n\n00:07:37.958 --> 00:07:39.958\nAwful.\n\n00:07:39.958 --> 00:07:42.958\nI never would ever agree to interview a modest person.\n\n00:07:42.958 --> 00:07:44.958\nThey have to think that they did something\n\n00:07:44.958 --> 00:07:46.958\nand that they want to share it with you.\n\n00:07:46.958 --> 00:07:50.958\nBut it comes down, in the end,\n\n00:07:50.958 --> 00:07:57.958\nto how do you get through all the barriers we have.\n\n00:07:57.958 --> 00:08:00.958\nAll of us are public and private beings,\n\n00:08:00.958 --> 00:08:06.958\nand if all you're going to get from the interviewee is their public self,\n\n00:08:06.958 --> 00:08:08.958\nthere's no point in it.\n\n00:08:08.958 --> 00:08:11.958\nIt's pre-programmed. It's infomercial,\n\n00:08:11.958 --> 00:08:14.958\nand we all have infomercials about our lives.\n\n00:08:14.958 --> 00:08:17.958\nWe know the great lines, we know the great moments,\n\n00:08:17.958 --> 00:08:19.958\nwe know what we're not going to share,\n\n00:08:19.958 --> 00:08:22.958\nand the point of this was not to embarrass anybody.\n\n00:08:22.958 --> 00:08:24.958\nThis wasn't -- and some of you will remember\n\n00:08:24.958 --> 00:08:26.958\nMike Wallace's old interviews --\n\n00:08:26.958 --> 00:08:29.958\ntough, aggressive and so forth. They have their place.\n\n00:08:29.958 --> 00:08:33.958\nI was trying to get them to say what they probably wanted to say,\n\n00:08:33.958 --> 00:08:40.958\nto break out of their own cocoon of the public self,\n\n00:08:40.958 --> 00:08:42.958\nand the more public they had been,\n\n00:08:42.958 --> 00:08:47.958\nthe more entrenched that person, that outer person was.\n\n00:08:47.958 --> 00:08:50.958\nAnd let me tell you at once the worse moment and the best moment\n\n00:08:50.958 --> 00:08:52.958\nthat happened in this interview series.\n\n00:08:52.958 --> 00:08:57.958\nIt all has to do with that shell that most of us have,\n\n00:08:57.958 --> 00:09:00.958\nand particularly certain people.\n\n00:09:00.958 --> 00:09:03.958\nThere's an extraordinary woman named Clare Boothe Luce.\n\n00:09:03.958 --> 00:09:06.958\nIt'll be your generational determinant\n\n00:09:06.958 --> 00:09:09.958\nas to whether her name means much to you.\n\n00:09:09.958 --> 00:09:14.958\nShe did so much. She was a playwright.\n\n00:09:14.958 --> 00:09:17.958\nShe did an extraordinary play called \"The Women.\"\n\n00:09:17.958 --> 00:09:19.958\nShe was a congresswoman\n\n00:09:19.958 --> 00:09:22.958\nwhen there weren't very many congresswomen.\n\n00:09:22.958 --> 00:09:24.958\nShe was editor of Vanity Fair,\n\n00:09:24.958 --> 00:09:28.958\none of the great phenomenal women of her day.\n\n00:09:28.958 --> 00:09:31.958\nAnd, incidentally, I call her\n\n00:09:31.958 --> 00:09:34.958\nthe Eleanor Roosevelt of the Right.\n\n00:09:34.958 --> 00:09:36.958\nShe was sort of adored on the Right\n\n00:09:36.958 --> 00:09:39.958\nthe way Eleanor Roosevelt was on the Left.\n\n00:09:39.958 --> 00:09:42.958\nAnd, in fact, when we did the interview --\n\n00:09:42.958 --> 00:09:44.958\nI did the living self-portrait with her --\n\n00:09:44.958 --> 00:09:46.958\nthere were three former directors of the CIA\n\n00:09:46.958 --> 00:09:48.958\nbasically sitting at her feet,\n\n00:09:48.958 --> 00:09:51.958\njust enjoying her presence.\n\n00:09:51.958 --> 00:09:53.958\nAnd I thought, this is going to be a piece of cake,\n\n00:09:53.958 --> 00:09:57.958\nbecause I always have preliminary talks with these people\n\n00:09:57.958 --> 00:10:00.958\nfor just maybe 10 or 15 minutes.\n\n00:10:00.958 --> 00:10:03.958\nWe never talk before that because if you talk before,\n\n00:10:03.958 --> 00:10:05.958\nyou don't get it on the stage.\n\n00:10:05.958 --> 00:10:09.958\nSo she and I had a delightful conversation.\n\n00:10:09.958 --> 00:10:12.958\nWe were on the stage and then --\n\n00:10:12.958 --> 00:10:14.958\nby the way, spectacular.\n\n00:10:14.958 --> 00:10:17.958\nIt was all part of Clare Boothe Luce's look.\n\n00:10:17.958 --> 00:10:20.958\nShe was in a great evening gown.\n\n00:10:20.958 --> 00:10:23.958\nShe was 80, almost that day of the interview,\n\n00:10:23.958 --> 00:10:25.958\nand there she was and there I was,\n\n00:10:25.958 --> 00:10:27.958\nand I just proceeded into the questions.\n\n00:10:27.958 --> 00:10:32.958\nAnd she stonewalled me. It was unbelievable.\n\n00:10:32.958 --> 00:10:37.958\nAnything that I would ask, she would turn around, dismiss,\n\n00:10:37.958 --> 00:10:39.958\nand I was basically up there -- any of you\n\n00:10:39.958 --> 00:10:41.958\nin the moderate-to-full entertainment world\n\n00:10:41.958 --> 00:10:44.958\nknow what it is to die onstage.\n\n00:10:44.958 --> 00:10:49.958\nAnd I was dying. She was absolutely not giving me a thing.\n\n00:10:49.958 --> 00:10:51.958\nAnd I began to wonder what was going on,\n\n00:10:51.958 --> 00:10:53.958\nand you think while you talk,\n\n00:10:53.958 --> 00:10:56.958\nand basically, I thought, I got it.\n\n00:10:56.958 --> 00:11:00.958\nWhen we were alone, I was her audience.\n\n00:11:00.958 --> 00:11:02.958\nNow I'm her competitor for the audience.\n\n00:11:02.958 --> 00:11:06.958\nThat's the problem here, and she's fighting me for that,\n\n00:11:06.958 --> 00:11:08.958\nand so then I asked her a question --\n\n00:11:08.958 --> 00:11:10.958\nI didn't know how I was going to get out of it --\n\n00:11:10.958 --> 00:11:16.958\nI asked her a question about her days as a playwright,\n\n00:11:16.958 --> 00:11:18.958\nand again, characteristically,\n\n00:11:18.958 --> 00:11:21.958\ninstead of saying, \"Oh yes, I was a playwright, and this is what blah blah blah,\"\n\n00:11:21.958 --> 00:11:24.958\nshe said, \"Oh, playwright. Everybody knows I was a playwright.\n\n00:11:24.958 --> 00:11:28.958\nMost people think that I was an actress. I was never an actress.\"\n\n00:11:28.958 --> 00:11:32.958\nBut I hadn't asked that, and then she went off on a tear,\n\n00:11:32.958 --> 00:11:35.958\nand she said, \"Oh, well, there was that one time that I was an actress.\n\n00:11:35.958 --> 00:11:38.958\nIt was for a charity in Connecticut when I was a congresswoman,\n\n00:11:38.958 --> 00:11:41.958\nand I got up there,\" and she went on and on, \"And then I got on the stage.\"\n\n00:11:41.958 --> 00:11:43.958\nAnd then she turned to me and said,\n\n00:11:43.958 --> 00:11:46.958\n\"And you know what those young actors did?\n\n00:11:46.958 --> 00:11:48.958\nThey upstaged me.\" And she said, \"Do you know what that is?\"\n\n00:11:48.958 --> 00:11:50.958\nJust withering in her contempt.\n\n00:11:50.958 --> 00:11:52.958\nAnd I said, \"I'm learning.\"\n\n00:11:52.958 --> 00:11:54.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:11:54.958 --> 00:11:59.958\nAnd she looked at me, and it was like the successful arm-wrestle,\n\n00:11:59.958 --> 00:12:03.958\nand then, after that, she delivered an extraordinary account\n\n00:12:03.958 --> 00:12:05.958\nof what her life really was like.\n\n00:12:05.958 --> 00:12:08.958\nI have to end that one. This is my tribute to Clare Boothe Luce.\n\n00:12:08.958 --> 00:12:10.958\nAgain, a remarkable person.\n\n00:12:10.958 --> 00:12:13.958\nI'm not politically attracted to her, but through her life force,\n\n00:12:13.958 --> 00:12:16.958\nI'm attracted to her.\n\n00:12:16.958 --> 00:12:21.958\nAnd the way she died -- she had, toward the end, a brain tumor.\n\n00:12:21.958 --> 00:12:24.958\nThat's probably as terrible a way to die as you can imagine,\n\n00:12:24.958 --> 00:12:30.958\nand very few of us were invited to a dinner party.\n\n00:12:30.958 --> 00:12:32.958\nAnd she was in horrible pain.\n\n00:12:32.958 --> 00:12:34.958\nWe all knew that.\n\n00:12:34.958 --> 00:12:37.958\nShe stayed in her room.\n\n00:12:37.958 --> 00:12:39.958\nEverybody came. The butler passed around canapes.\n\n00:12:39.958 --> 00:12:42.958\nThe usual sort of thing.\n\n00:12:42.958 --> 00:12:45.958\nThen at a certain moment, the door opened\n\n00:12:45.958 --> 00:12:49.958\nand she walked out perfectly dressed, completely composed.\n\n00:12:49.958 --> 00:12:53.958\nThe public self, the beauty, the intellect,\n\n00:12:53.958 --> 00:12:57.958\nand she walked around and talked to every person there\n\n00:12:57.958 --> 00:13:00.958\nand then went back into the room and was never seen again.\n\n00:13:00.958 --> 00:13:06.958\nShe wanted the control of her final moment, and she did it amazingly.\n\n00:13:06.958 --> 00:13:10.958\nNow, there are other ways that you get somebody to open up,\n\n00:13:10.958 --> 00:13:14.958\nand this is just a brief reference.\n\n00:13:14.958 --> 00:13:16.958\nIt wasn't this arm-wrestle,\n\n00:13:16.958 --> 00:13:18.958\nbut it was a little surprising for the person involved.\n\n00:13:18.958 --> 00:13:22.958\nI interviewed Steve Martin. It wasn't all that long ago.\n\n00:13:22.958 --> 00:13:24.958\nAnd we were sitting there,\n\n00:13:24.958 --> 00:13:27.958\nand almost toward the beginning of the interview,\n\n00:13:27.958 --> 00:13:32.958\nI turned to him and I said, \"Steve,\" or \"Mr. Martin,\n\n00:13:32.958 --> 00:13:38.958\nit is said that all comedians have unhappy childhoods.\n\n00:13:38.958 --> 00:13:40.958\nWas yours unhappy?\"\n\n00:13:40.958 --> 00:13:43.958\nAnd he looked at me, you know, as if to say,\n\n00:13:43.958 --> 00:13:46.958\n\"This is how you're going to start this thing, right off?\"\n\n00:13:46.958 --> 00:13:48.958\nAnd then he turned to me, not stupidly,\n\n00:13:48.958 --> 00:13:52.958\nand he said, \"What was your childhood like?\"\n\n00:13:52.958 --> 00:13:55.958\nAnd I said -- these are all arm wrestles, but they're affectionate --\n\n00:13:55.958 --> 00:13:58.958\nand I said, \"My father was loving and supportive,\n\n00:13:58.958 --> 00:14:00.958\nwhich is why I'm not funny.\"\n\n00:14:00.958 --> 00:14:02.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:14:02.958 --> 00:14:06.958\nAnd he looked at me, and then we heard the big sad story.\n\n00:14:06.958 --> 00:14:08.958\nHis father was an SOB,\n\n00:14:08.958 --> 00:14:12.958\nand, in fact, he was another comedian with an unhappy childhood,\n\n00:14:12.958 --> 00:14:15.958\nbut then we were off and running.\n\n00:14:15.958 --> 00:14:16.958\nSo the question is:\n\n00:14:16.958 --> 00:14:19.958\nWhat is the key that's going to allow this to proceed?\n\n00:14:19.958 --> 00:14:21.958\nNow, these are arm wrestle questions,\n\n00:14:21.958 --> 00:14:24.958\nbut I want to tell you about questions\n\n00:14:24.958 --> 00:14:27.958\nthat are more related to empathy\n\n00:14:27.958 --> 00:14:30.958\nand that really, very often, are the questions\n\n00:14:30.958 --> 00:14:33.958\nthat people have been waiting their whole lives to be asked.\n\n00:14:33.958 --> 00:14:37.958\nAnd I'll just give you two examples of this because of the time constraints.\n\n00:14:37.958 --> 00:14:43.958\nOne was an interview I did with one of the great American biographers.\n\n00:14:43.958 --> 00:14:45.958\nAgain, some of you will know him, most of you won't, Dumas Malone.\n\n00:14:45.958 --> 00:14:49.958\nHe did a five-volume biography of Thomas Jefferson,\n\n00:14:49.958 --> 00:14:54.958\nspent virtually his whole life with Thomas Jefferson,\n\n00:14:54.958 --> 00:14:56.958\nand by the way, at one point I asked him,\n\n00:14:56.958 --> 00:14:58.958\n\"Would you like to have met him?\"\n\n00:14:58.958 --> 00:15:00.958\nAnd he said, \"Well, of course,\n\n00:15:00.958 --> 00:15:03.958\nbut actually, I know him better than anyone who ever met him,\n\n00:15:03.958 --> 00:15:05.958\nbecause I got to read all of his letters.\"\n\n00:15:05.958 --> 00:15:11.958\nSo, he was very satisfied with the kind of relationship they had over 50 years.\n\n00:15:11.958 --> 00:15:14.958\nAnd I asked him one question.\n\n00:15:14.958 --> 00:15:18.958\nI said, \"Did Jefferson ever disappoint you?\"\n\n00:15:18.958 --> 00:15:23.958\nAnd here is this man who had given his whole life to uncovering Jefferson\n\n00:15:23.958 --> 00:15:25.958\nand connecting with him,\n\n00:15:25.958 --> 00:15:30.958\nand he said, \"Well ...\" -- I'm going to do a bad southern accent.\n\n00:15:30.958 --> 00:15:33.958\nDumas Malone was from Mississippi originally.\n\n00:15:33.958 --> 00:15:37.958\nBut he said, \"Well,\" he said, \"I'm afraid so.\"\n\n00:15:37.958 --> 00:15:40.958\nHe said, \"You know, I've read everything,\n\n00:15:40.958 --> 00:15:48.958\nand sometimes Mr. Jefferson would smooth the truth a bit.\"\n\n00:15:48.958 --> 00:15:51.958\nAnd he basically was saying that this was a man\n\n00:15:51.958 --> 00:15:54.958\nwho lied more than he wished he had,\n\n00:15:54.958 --> 00:15:56.958\nbecause he saw the letters.\n\n00:15:56.958 --> 00:16:00.958\nHe said, \"But I understand that.\" He said, \"I understand that.\"\n\n00:16:00.958 --> 00:16:05.958\nHe said, \"We southerners do like a smooth surface,\n\n00:16:05.958 --> 00:16:09.958\nso that there were times when he just didn't want the confrontation.\"\n\n00:16:09.958 --> 00:16:13.958\nAnd he said, \"Now, John Adams was too honest.\"\n\n00:16:13.958 --> 00:16:16.958\nAnd he started to talk about that, and later on he invited me to his house,\n\n00:16:16.958 --> 00:16:18.958\nand I met his wife who was from Massachusetts,\n\n00:16:18.958 --> 00:16:21.958\nand he and she had exactly the relationship\n\n00:16:21.958 --> 00:16:24.958\nof Thomas Jefferson and John Adams.\n\n00:16:24.958 --> 00:16:26.958\nShe was the New Englander and abrasive,\n\n00:16:26.958 --> 00:16:29.958\nand he was this courtly fellow.\n\n00:16:29.958 --> 00:16:32.958\nBut really the most important question I ever asked,\n\n00:16:32.958 --> 00:16:35.958\nand most of the times when I talk about it,\n\n00:16:35.958 --> 00:16:40.958\npeople kind of suck in their breath at my audacity, or cruelty,\n\n00:16:40.958 --> 00:16:44.958\nbut I promise you it was the right question.\n\n00:16:44.958 --> 00:16:47.958\nThis was to Agnes de Mille.\n\n00:16:47.958 --> 00:16:51.958\nAgnes de Mille is one of the great choreographers in our history.\n\n00:16:51.958 --> 00:16:55.958\nShe basically created the dances in \"Oklahoma,\"\n\n00:16:55.958 --> 00:16:57.958\ntransforming the American theater.\n\n00:16:57.958 --> 00:16:59.958\nAn amazing woman.\n\n00:16:59.958 --> 00:17:04.958\nAt the time that I proposed to her that --\n\n00:17:04.958 --> 00:17:06.958\nby the way, I would have proposed to her; she was extraordinary --\n\n00:17:06.958 --> 00:17:08.958\nbut proposed to her that she come on.\n\n00:17:08.958 --> 00:17:10.958\nShe said, \"Come to my apartment.\"\n\n00:17:10.958 --> 00:17:12.958\nShe lived in New York.\n\n00:17:12.958 --> 00:17:16.958\n\"Come to my apartment and we'll talk for those 15 minutes,\n\n00:17:16.958 --> 00:17:18.958\nand then we'll decide whether we proceed.\"\n\n00:17:18.958 --> 00:17:23.958\nAnd so I showed up in this dark, rambling New York apartment,\n\n00:17:23.958 --> 00:17:26.958\nand she called out to me, and she was in bed.\n\n00:17:26.958 --> 00:17:28.958\nI had known that she had had a stroke,\n\n00:17:28.958 --> 00:17:30.958\nand that was some 10 years before.\n\n00:17:30.958 --> 00:17:35.958\nAnd so she spent almost all of her life in bed,\n\n00:17:35.958 --> 00:17:37.958\nbut -- I speak of the life force --\n\n00:17:37.958 --> 00:17:39.958\nher hair was askew.\n\n00:17:39.958 --> 00:17:42.958\nShe wasn't about to make up for this occasion.\n\n00:17:42.958 --> 00:17:45.958\nAnd she was sitting there surrounded by books,\n\n00:17:45.958 --> 00:17:49.958\nand her most interesting possession she felt at that moment\n\n00:17:49.958 --> 00:17:55.958\nwas her will, which she had by her side.\n\n00:17:55.958 --> 00:17:59.958\nShe wasn't unhappy about this. She was resigned.\n\n00:17:59.958 --> 00:18:05.958\nShe said, \"I keep this will by my bed, memento mori,\n\n00:18:05.958 --> 00:18:08.958\nand I change it all the time\n\n00:18:08.958 --> 00:18:10.958\njust because I want to.\"\n\n00:18:10.958 --> 00:18:15.958\nAnd she was loving the prospect of death as much as she had loved life.\n\n00:18:15.958 --> 00:18:18.958\nI thought, this is somebody I've got to get in this series.\n\n00:18:18.958 --> 00:18:20.958\nShe agreed.\n\n00:18:20.958 --> 00:18:23.958\nShe came on. Of course she was wheelchaired on.\n\n00:18:23.958 --> 00:18:26.958\nHalf of her body was stricken, the other half not.\n\n00:18:26.958 --> 00:18:29.958\nShe was, of course, done up for the occasion,\n\n00:18:29.958 --> 00:18:33.958\nbut this was a woman in great physical distress.\n\n00:18:33.958 --> 00:18:36.958\nAnd we had a conversation,\n\n00:18:36.958 --> 00:18:39.958\nand then I asked her this unthinkable question.\n\n00:18:39.958 --> 00:18:48.958\nI said, \"Was it a problem for you in your life that you were not beautiful?\"\n\n00:18:48.958 --> 00:18:51.958\nAnd the audience just -- you know,\n\n00:18:51.958 --> 00:18:54.958\nthey're always on the side of the interviewee,\n\n00:18:54.958 --> 00:18:57.958\nand they felt that this was a kind of assault,\n\n00:18:57.958 --> 00:18:59.958\nbut this was the question she had\n\n00:18:59.958 --> 00:19:02.958\nwanted somebody to ask her whole life.\n\n00:19:02.958 --> 00:19:07.958\nAnd she began to talk about her childhood, when she was beautiful,\n\n00:19:07.958 --> 00:19:10.958\nand she literally turned -- here she was, in this broken body --\n\n00:19:10.958 --> 00:19:13.958\nand she turned to the audience and\n\n00:19:13.958 --> 00:19:15.958\ndescribed herself as the fair demoiselle\n\n00:19:15.958 --> 00:19:21.958\nwith her red hair and her light steps and so forth,\n\n00:19:21.958 --> 00:19:24.958\nand then she said, \"And then puberty hit.\"\n\n00:19:24.958 --> 00:19:26.958\nAnd she began to talk about things that had happened\n\n00:19:26.958 --> 00:19:28.958\nto her body and her face,\n\n00:19:28.958 --> 00:19:32.958\nand how she could no longer count on her beauty,\n\n00:19:32.958 --> 00:19:39.958\nand her family then treated her like the ugly sister of the beautiful one\n\n00:19:39.958 --> 00:19:41.958\nfor whom all the ballet lessons were given.\n\n00:19:41.958 --> 00:19:46.958\nAnd she had to go along just to be with her sister for company,\n\n00:19:46.958 --> 00:19:49.958\nand in that process, she made a number of decisions.\n\n00:19:49.958 --> 00:19:51.958\nFirst of all, was that dance, even though\n\n00:19:51.958 --> 00:19:53.958\nit hadn't been offered to her, was her life.\n\n00:19:53.958 --> 00:19:55.958\nAnd secondly, she had better be,\n\n00:19:55.958 --> 00:19:57.958\nalthough she did dance for a while, a choreographer\n\n00:19:57.958 --> 00:20:00.958\nbecause then her looks didn't matter.\n\n00:20:00.958 --> 00:20:07.958\nBut she was thrilled to get that out as a real, real fact in her life.\n\n00:20:07.958 --> 00:20:12.958\nIt was an amazing privilege to do this series.\n\n00:20:12.958 --> 00:20:18.958\nThere were other moments like that, very few moments of silence.\n\n00:20:18.958 --> 00:20:21.958\nThe key point was empathy\n\n00:20:21.958 --> 00:20:25.958\nbecause everybody in their lives\n\n00:20:25.958 --> 00:20:29.958\nis really waiting for people to ask them questions,\n\n00:20:29.958 --> 00:20:31.958\nso that they can be truthful about who they are\n\n00:20:31.958 --> 00:20:34.958\nand how they became what they are,\n\n00:20:34.958 --> 00:20:38.958\nand I commend that to you, even if you're not doing interviews.\n\n00:20:38.958 --> 00:20:40.958\nJust be that way with your friends\n\n00:20:40.958 --> 00:20:43.958\nand particularly the older members of your family.\n\n00:20:43.958 --> 00:20:45.958\nThank you very much."}, {"title": "How low-cost eye care can be world-class", "duration": "1047", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/thulasiraj_ravilla_how_low_cost_eye_care_can_be_world_class", "transcript": "Good morning. I've come here to share with you an experiment of how to get rid of one form of human suffering. It really is a story of Dr. Venkataswamy. His mission and his message is about the Aravind Eye Care System. I think first it's important for us to recognize what it is to be blind.(Music)Woman: Everywhere I went looking for work, they said no, what use do we have for a blind woman? I couldn't thread a needle or see the lice in my hair. If an ant fell into my rice, I couldn't see that either.Thulasiraj Ravilla: Becoming blind is a big part of it, but I think it also deprives the person of their livelihood, their dignity, their independence, and their status in the family. So she is just one amongst the millions who are blind. And the irony is that they don't need to be.A simple, well-proven surgery can restore sight to millions, and something even simpler, a pair of glasses, can make millions more see. If we add to that the many of us here now who are more productive because they have a pair of glasses, then almost one in five Indians will require eye care, a staggering 200 million people. Today, we're reaching not even 10 percent of them.So this is the context in which Aravind came into existence about 30 years back as a post-retirement project of Dr. V. He started this with no money. He had to mortgage all his life savings to make a bank loan. And over time, we have grown into a network of five hospitals, predominately in the state of Tamil Nadu and Puducherry, and then we added several, what we call Vision Centers as a hub-and-spoke model. And then more recently we started managing hospitals in other parts of the country and also setting up hospitals in other parts of the world as well.The last three decades, we have done about three-and-a-half million surgeries, a vast majority of them for the poor people. Now, each year we perform about 300,000 surgeries. A typical day at Aravind, we would do about a thousand surgeries, maybe see about 6,000 patients, send out teams into the villages to examine, bring back patients, lots of telemedicine consultations, and, on top of that, do a lot of training, both for doctors and technicians who will become the future staff of Aravind.And then doing this day-in and day-out, and doing it well, requires a lot of inspiration and a lot of hard work. And I think this was possible thanks to the building blocks put in place by Dr. V., a value system, an efficient delivery process, and fostering the culture of innovation.(Music)Dr. V: I used to sit with the ordinary village man because I am from a village, and suddenly you turn around and seem to be in contact with his inner being, you seem to be one with him. Here is a soul which has got all the simplicity of confidence. Doctor, whatever you say, I accept it. An implicit faith in you and then you respond to it. Here is an old lady who has got so much faith in me, I must do my best for her. When we grow in spiritual consciousness, we identify ourselves with all that is in the world, so there is no exploitation. It is ourselves we are helping. It is ourselves we are healing.(Applause)This helped us build a very ethical and very highly patient-centric organization and systems that support it. But on a practical level, you also have to deliver services efficiently, and, odd as it may seem, the inspiration came from McDonald's.Dr. V: See, McDonald's' concept is simple. They feel they can train people all over the world, irrespective of different religions, cultures, all those things, to produce a product in the same way and deliver it in the same manner in hundreds of places.Larry Brilliant: He kept talking about McDonalds and hamburgers, and none of it made any sense to us. He wanted to create a franchise, a mechanism of delivery of eye care with the efficiency of McDonald's.Dr. V: Supposing I'm able to produce eye care, techniques, methods, all in the same way, and make it available in every corner of the world. The problem of blindness is gone.TR: If you think about it, I think the eyeball is the same, as American or African, the problem is the same, the treatment is the same. And yet, why should there be so much variation in quality and in service, and that was the fundamental principle that we followed when we designed the delivery systems. And, of course, the challenge was that it's a huge problem, we are talking of millions of people, very little resource to deal with it, and then lots of logistics and affordability issues.And then so, one had to constantly innovate. And one of the early innovations, which still continues, is to create ownership in the community to the problem, and then engage with them as a partner, and here is one such event. Here a community camp just organized by the community themselves, where they find a place, organize volunteers, and then we'll do our part. You know, check their vision, and then you have doctors who you find out what the problem is and then determine what further testing should be done, and then those tests are done by technicians who check for glasses, or check for glaucoma.And then, with all these results, the doctor makes a final diagnosis, and then prescribes a line of treatment, and if they need a pair of glasses, they are available right there at the camp site, usually under a tree. But they get glasses in the frames of their choice, and that's very important because I think glasses, in addition to helping people see, is also a fashion statement, and they're willing to pay for it. So they get it in about 20 minutes and those who require surgery, are counseled, and then there are buses waiting, which will transport them to the base hospital.And if it was not for this kind of logistics and support, many people like this would probably never get services, and certainly not when they most need it. They receive surgery the following day, and then they will stay for a day or two, and then they are put back on the buses to be taken back to where they came from, and where their families will be waiting to take them back home.(Applause)And this happens several thousand times each year. It may sound impressive that we're seeing lots of patients, very efficient process, but we looked at, are we solving the problem? We did a study, a scientifically designed process, and then, to our dismay, we found this was only reaching seven percent of those in need, and we're not adequately addressing more, bigger problems.So we had to do something different, so we set up what we call primary eye care centers, vision centers. These are truly paperless offices with completely electronic medical records and so on. They receive comprehensive eye exams. We kind of changed the simple digital camera into a retinal camera, and then every patient gets their teleconsultation with a doctor.The effect of this has been that, within the first year, we really had a 40 percent penetration in the market that it served, which is over 50,000 people. And the second year went up to 75 percent. So I think we have a process by which we can really penetrate into the market and reach everyone who needs it, and in this process of using technology, make sure that most don't need to come to the base hospital.And how much will they pay for this? We fixed the pricing, taking into account what they would save in bus fare in coming to a city, so they pay about 20 rupees, and that's good for three consultations.(Applause)The other challenge was, how do you give high-tech or more advanced treatment and care? We designed a van with a VSAT, which sends out images of patients to the base hospital where it is diagnosed, and then as the patient is waiting, the report goes back to the patient, it gets printed out, the patient gets it, and then gets a consultation about what they should be doing \u2014 I mean, go see a doctor or come back after six months, and then this happens as a way of bridging the technology competence.So the impact of all this has been essentially one of growing the market, because it focused on the non-customer, and then by reaching the unreached, we're able to significantly grow the market.The other aspect is how do you deal with this efficiently when you have very few ophthalmologists? So what is in this video is a surgeon operating, and then you see on the other side, another patient is getting ready. So, as they finish the surgery, they just swing the microscope over, the tables are placed so that their distance is just right, and then we need to do this, because, by doing this kind of process, we're able to more than quadruple the productivity of the surgeon.And then to support the surgeon, we require a certain workforce. And then we focused on village girls that we recruited, and then they really are the backbone of the organization. They do almost all of the skill-based routine tasks. They do one thing at a time. They do it extremely well. With the result we have very high productivity, very high quality at very, very low cost. So, putting all this together, what really happened was the productivity of our staff was significantly higher than anyone else.(Applause)This is a very busy table, but what this really is conveying is that, when it comes to quality, we have put in very good quality-assurance systems. As a result, our complications are significantly lower than what has been reported in the United Kingdom, and you don't see those kind of numbers very often.(Applause)So the final part of the puzzle is, how do you make all this work financially, especially when the people can't pay for it? So what we did was, we gave away a lot of it for free, and then those who pay, I mean, they paid local market rates, nothing more, and often much less. And we were helped by the market inefficiency. I think that has been a big savior, even now. And, of course, one needs the mindset to be wanting to give away what you have as a surplus.The result has been, over the years, the expenditure has increased with volumes. The revenues increase at a higher level, giving us a healthy margin while you're treating a large number of people for free. I think in absolute terms, last year we earned about 20-odd million dollars, spent about 13 million, with over a 40 percent EBITA.(Applause)But this really requires going beyond what we do, or what we have done, if you really want to achieve solving this problem of blindness. And what we did was a couple of very counter-intuitive things. We created competition for ourselves, and then we made eye care affordable by making low-cost consumables. We proactively and systematically promoted these practices to many hospitals in India, many in our own backyards and then in other parts of the world as well. The impact of this has been that these hospitals, in the second year after our consultation, are double their output and then achieve financial recovery as well.The other part was how do you address this increase in cost of technology? There was a time when we failed to negotiate the [intra-ocular lens] prices to be at affordable levels, so we set up a manufacturing unit. And then, over time, we were able to bring down the cost significantly to about two percent of what it used to be when we started out. Today, we believe we have about seven percent of the global market, and they're used in about 120-odd countries.To conclude, I mean, what we do, does it have a broader relevance, or is it just India or developing countries? So to address this, we studied UK versus Aravind. What it shows is that we do roughly about 60 percent of the volume of what the UK does, near a half-million surgeries as a whole country. And we do about 300,000. And then we train about 50 ophthalmologists against the 70 trained by them, comparable quality, both in training and in patient care. So we're really comparing apples to apples. We looked at cost. (Laughter)(Applause)So, I think it is simple to say just because the U.K. isn't India the difference is happening. I think there is more to it. I mean, I think one has to look at other aspects as well. Maybe there is \u2014 the solution to the cost could be in productivity, maybe in efficiency, in the clinical process, or in how much they pay for the lenses or consumables, or regulations, their defensive practice. So, I think decoding this can probably bring answers to most developed countries including the U.S., and maybe Obama's ratings can go up again.(Laughter)Another insight, which, again, I want to leave with you, in conditions where the problem is very large, which cuts across all economic strata, where we have a good solution, I think the process I described, you know, productivity, quality, patient-centered care, can give an answer, and there are many which fit this paradigm. You take dentistry, hearing aid, maternity and so on. There are many where this paradigm can now play, but I think probably one of the most challenging things is on the softer side.Now, how do you create compassion? Now, how do you make people own the problem, want to do something about it? There are a bit harder issues. And I'm sure people in this crowd can probably find the solutions to these.So I want to end my talk leaving this thought and challenge to you.Dr. V: When you grow in spiritual consciousness, we identify with all that is in the world so there is no exploitation. It is ourselves we are helping. It is ourselves we are healing.TR: Thank you very much.(Applause)", "id": 709, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:11.958 --> 00:00:13.958\nGood

highly patient-centric organization\n\n00:04:25.958 --> 00:04:27.958\nand systems that support it.\n\n00:04:27.958 --> 00:04:33.958\nBut on a practical level, you also have to deliver services efficiently,\n\n00:04:33.958 --> 00:04:37.958\nand, odd as it may seem, the inspiration came from McDonald's.\n\n00:04:37.958 --> 00:04:41.958\nDr. V: See, McDonald's' concept is simple.\n\n00:04:41.958 --> 00:04:49.958\nThey feel they can train people all over the world,\n\n00:04:49.958 --> 00:04:52.958\nirrespective of different religions, cultures, all those things,\n\n00:04:52.958 --> 00:04:56.958\nto produce a product in the same way\n\n00:04:56.958 --> 00:04:59.958\nand deliver it in the same manner\n\n00:04:59.958 --> 00:05:01.958\nin hundreds of places.\n\n00:05:01.958 --> 00:05:03.958\nLarry Brilliant: He kept talking about McDonalds and hamburgers,\n\n00:05:03.958 --> 00:05:09.958\nand none of it made any sense to us.\n\n00:05:09.958 --> 00:05:12.958\nHe wanted to create a franchise,\n\n00:05:12.958 --> 00:05:15.958\na mechanism of delivery of eye care\n\n00:05:15.958 --> 00:05:18.958\nwith the efficiency of McDonald's.\n\n00:05:18.958 --> 00:05:20.958\nDr. V: Supposing I'm able to produce eye care,\n\n00:05:20.958 --> 00:05:24.958\ntechniques, methods, all in the same way,\n\n00:05:24.958 --> 00:05:27.958\nand make it available in every corner of the world.\n\n00:05:27.958 --> 00:05:29.958\nThe problem of blindness is gone.\n\n00:05:30.958 --> 00:05:33.958\nTR: If you think about it, I think the eyeball is the same,\n\n00:05:33.958 --> 00:05:35.958\nas American or African,\n\n00:05:35.958 --> 00:05:38.958\nthe problem is the same, the treatment is the same.\n\n00:05:38.958 --> 00:05:42.958\nAnd yet, why should there be so much variation in quality and in service,\n\n00:05:42.958 --> 00:05:45.958\nand that was the fundamental principle that we followed\n\n00:05:45.958 --> 00:05:48.958\nwhen we designed the delivery systems.\n\n00:05:48.958 --> 00:05:51.958\nAnd, of course, the challenge was that it's a huge problem,\n\n00:05:51.958 --> 00:05:54.958\nwe are talking of millions of people,\n\n00:05:54.958 --> 00:05:57.958\nvery little resource to deal with it,\n\n00:05:57.958 --> 00:06:01.958\nand then lots of logistics and affordability issues.\n\n00:06:01.958 --> 00:06:04.958\nAnd then so, one had to constantly innovate.\n\n00:06:04.958 --> 00:06:07.958\nAnd one of the early innovations, which still continues,\n\n00:06:07.958 --> 00:06:11.958\nis to create ownership in the community to the problem,\n\n00:06:11.958 --> 00:06:14.958\nand then engage with them as a partner,\n\n00:06:14.958 --> 00:06:16.958\nand here is one such event.\n\n00:06:16.958 --> 00:06:19.958\nHere a community camp just organized\n\n00:06:19.958 --> 00:06:22.958\nby the community themselves,\n\n00:06:22.958 --> 00:06:25.958\nwhere they find a place, organize volunteers,\n\n00:06:25.958 --> 00:06:29.958\nand then we'll do our part. You know, check their vision,\n\n00:06:30.958 --> 00:06:33.958\nand then you have doctors who you find out what the problem is\n\n00:06:33.958 --> 00:06:36.958\nand then determine what further testing should be done,\n\n00:06:36.958 --> 00:06:41.958\nand then those tests are done by technicians\n\n00:06:41.958 --> 00:06:45.958\nwho check for glasses,\n\n00:06:45.958 --> 00:06:49.958\nor check for glaucoma.\n\n00:06:49.958 --> 00:06:53.958\nAnd then, with all these results, the doctor makes a final diagnosis,\n\n00:06:53.958 --> 00:06:56.958\nand then prescribes a line of treatment,\n\n00:06:56.958 --> 00:07:00.958\nand if they need a pair of glasses, they are available right there at the camp site,\n\n00:07:00.958 --> 00:07:02.958\nusually under a tree.\n\n00:07:02.958 --> 00:07:05.958\nBut they get glasses in the frames of their choice,\n\n00:07:05.958 --> 00:07:08.958\nand that's very important because I think glasses,\n\n00:07:08.958 --> 00:07:10.958\nin addition to helping people see,\n\n00:07:10.958 --> 00:07:13.958\nis also a fashion statement, and they're willing to pay for it.\n\n00:07:18.958 --> 00:07:21.958\nSo they get it in about 20 minutes\n\n00:07:21.958 --> 00:07:24.958\nand those who require surgery, are counseled,\n\n00:07:24.958 --> 00:07:27.958\nand then there are buses waiting,\n\n00:07:27.958 --> 00:07:30.958\nwhich will transport them to the base hospital.\n\n00:07:30.958 --> 00:07:35.958\nAnd if it was not for this kind of logistics and support,\n\n00:07:35.958 --> 00:07:38.958\nmany people like this would probably never get services,\n\n00:07:38.958 --> 00:07:42.958\nand certainly not when they most need it.\n\n00:07:42.958 --> 00:07:46.958\nThey receive surgery the following day,\n\n00:07:46.958 --> 00:07:49.958\nand then they will stay for a day or two,\n\n00:07:49.958 --> 00:07:51.958\nand then they are put back on the buses\n\n00:07:51.958 --> 00:07:54.958\nto be taken back to where they came from,\n\n00:07:54.958 --> 00:07:58.958\nand where their families will be waiting to take them back home.\n\n00:07:59.958 --> 00:08:05.958\n(Applause)\n\n00:08:05.958 --> 00:08:10.958\nAnd this happens several thousand times each year.\n\n00:08:10.958 --> 00:08:13.958\nIt may sound impressive that we're seeing lots of patients,\n\n00:08:13.958 --> 00:08:15.958\nvery efficient process,\n\n00:08:15.958 --> 00:08:19.958\nbut we looked at, are we solving the problem?\n\n00:08:19.958 --> 00:08:21.958\nWe did a study, a scientifically designed process,\n\n00:08:21.958 --> 00:08:23.958\nand then, to our dismay,\n\n00:08:23.958 --> 00:08:28.958\nwe found this was only reaching seven percent of those in need,\n\n00:08:28.958 --> 00:08:32.958\nand we're not adequately addressing more, bigger problems.\n\n00:08:32.958 --> 00:08:34.958\nSo we had to do something different,\n\n00:08:34.958 --> 00:08:39.958\nso we set up what we call primary eye care centers, vision centers.\n\n00:08:39.958 --> 00:08:41.958\nThese are truly paperless offices\n\n00:08:41.958 --> 00:08:45.958\nwith completely electronic medical records and so on.\n\n00:08:45.958 --> 00:08:48.958\nThey receive comprehensive eye exams.\n\n00:08:48.958 --> 00:08:52.958\nWe kind of changed the simple digital camera into a retinal camera,\n\n00:08:52.958 --> 00:08:56.958\nand then every patient gets their teleconsultation with a doctor.\n\n00:08:58.958 --> 00:09:02.958\nThe effect of this has been that, within the first year,\n\n00:09:02.958 --> 00:09:07.958\nwe really had a 40 percent penetration in the market that it served,\n\n00:09:07.958 --> 00:09:09.958\nwhich is over 50,000 people.\n\n00:09:09.958 --> 00:09:11.958\nAnd the second year went up to 75 percent.\n\n00:09:11.958 --> 00:09:13.958\nSo I think we have a process by which\n\n00:09:13.958 --> 00:09:15.958\nwe can really penetrate into the market\n\n00:09:15.958 --> 00:09:18.958\nand reach everyone who needs it,\n\n00:09:18.958 --> 00:09:21.958\nand in this process of using technology, make sure\n\n00:09:21.958 --> 00:09:24.958\nthat most don't need to come to the base hospital.\n\n00:09:24.958 --> 00:09:26.958\nAnd how much will they pay for this?\n\n00:09:26.958 --> 00:09:29.958\nWe fixed the pricing, taking into account\n\n00:09:29.958 --> 00:09:33.958\nwhat they would save in bus fare in coming to a city,\n\n00:09:33.958 --> 00:09:37.958\nso they pay about 20 rupees, and that's good for three consultations.\n\n00:09:37.958 --> 00:09:40.958\n(Applause)\n\n00:09:40.958 --> 00:09:43.958\nThe other challenge was, how do you give high-tech\n\n00:09:43.958 --> 00:09:46.958\nor more advanced treatment and care?\n\n00:09:46.958 --> 00:09:49.958\nWe designed a van with a VSAT,\n\n00:09:49.958 --> 00:09:53.958\nwhich sends out images of patients to the base hospital\n\n00:09:53.958 --> 00:09:56.958\nwhere it is diagnosed,\n\n00:09:56.958 --> 00:10:00.958\nand then as the patient is waiting, the report goes back to the patient,\n\n00:10:00.958 --> 00:10:03.958\nit gets printed out, the patient gets it,\n\n00:10:03.958 --> 00:10:06.958\nand then gets a consultation about what they should be doing --\n\n00:10:06.958 --> 00:10:09.958\nI mean, go see a doctor or come back after six months,\n\n00:10:09.958 --> 00:10:11.958\nand then this happens as a way of\n\n00:10:11.958 --> 00:10:14.958\nbridging the technology competence.\n\n00:10:16.958 --> 00:10:20.958\nSo the impact of all this has been essentially one of growing the market,\n\n00:10:20.958 --> 00:10:23.958\nbecause it focused on the non-customer,\n\n00:10:23.958 --> 00:10:26.958\nand then by reaching the unreached,\n\n00:10:26.958 --> 00:10:28.958\nwe're able to significantly grow the market.\n\n00:10:28.958 --> 00:10:32.958\nThe other aspect is how do you deal with this efficiently\n\n00:10:32.958 --> 00:10:35.958\nwhen you have very few ophthalmologists?\n\n00:10:35.958 --> 00:10:38.958\nSo what is in this video is a surgeon operating,\n\n00:10:38.958 --> 00:10:40.958\nand then you see on the other side,\n\n00:10:40.958 --> 00:10:42.958\nanother patient is getting ready.\n\n00:10:42.958 --> 00:10:45.958\nSo, as they finish the surgery,\n\n00:10:45.958 --> 00:10:48.958\nthey just swing the microscope over,\n\n00:10:48.958 --> 00:10:52.958\nthe tables are placed so that their distance is just right,\n\n00:10:52.958 --> 00:10:55.958\nand then we need to do this, because, by doing this kind of process,\n\n00:10:55.958 --> 00:11:00.958\nwe're able to more than quadruple the productivity of the surgeon.\n\n00:11:00.958 --> 00:11:02.958\nAnd then to support the surgeon,\n\n00:11:02.958 --> 00:11:05.958\nwe require a certain workforce.\n\n00:11:05.958 --> 00:11:09.958\nAnd then we focused on village girls that we recruited,\n\n00:11:09.958 --> 00:11:12.958\nand then they really are the backbone of the organization.\n\n00:11:12.958 --> 00:11:16.958\nThey do almost all of the skill-based routine tasks.\n\n00:11:16.958 --> 00:11:19.958\nThey do one thing at a time. They do it extremely well.\n\n00:11:19.958 --> 00:11:22.958\nWith the result we have very high productivity,\n\n00:11:22.958 --> 00:11:25.958\nvery high quality at very, very low cost.\n\n00:11:27.958 --> 00:11:30.958\nSo, putting all this together, what really happened was\n\n00:11:30.958 --> 00:11:33.958\nthe productivity of our staff was\n\n00:11:33.958 --> 00:11:36.958\nsignificantly higher than anyone else.\n\n00:11:36.958 --> 00:11:42.958\n(Applause)\n\n00:11:42.958 --> 00:11:44.958\nThis is a very busy table,\n\n00:11:44.958 --> 00:11:46.958\nbut what this really is conveying is that,\n\n00:11:46.958 --> 00:11:48.958\nwhen it comes to quality, we have put in\n\n00:11:48.958 --> 00:11:51.958\nvery good quality-assurance systems.\n\n00:11:51.958 --> 00:11:54.958\nAs a result, our complications are significantly lower\n\n00:11:54.958 --> 00:11:57.958\nthan what has been reported in the United Kingdom,\n\n00:11:57.958 --> 00:12:00.958\nand you don't see those kind of numbers very often.\n\n00:12:00.958 --> 00:12:02.958\n(Applause)\n\n00:12:02.958 --> 00:12:04.958\nSo the final part of the puzzle is,\n\n00:12:04.958 --> 00:12:07.958\nhow do you make all this work financially,\n\n00:12:07.958 --> 00:12:10.958\nespecially when the people can't pay for it?\n\n00:12:10.958 --> 00:12:14.958\nSo what we did was, we gave away a lot of it for free,\n\n00:12:14.958 --> 00:12:17.958\nand then those who pay, I mean, they paid local market rates,\n\n00:12:17.958 --> 00:12:19.958\nnothing more, and often much less.\n\n00:12:19.958 --> 00:12:22.958\nAnd we were helped by the market inefficiency.\n\n00:12:22.958 --> 00:12:25.958\nI think that has been a big savior, even now.\n\n00:12:25.958 --> 00:12:29.958\nAnd, of course, one needs the mindset to be wanting to give away\n\n00:12:29.958 --> 00:12:32.958\nwhat you have as a surplus.\n\n00:12:32.958 --> 00:12:34.958\nThe result has been, over the years,\n\n00:12:34.958 --> 00:12:36.958\nthe expenditure has increased with volumes.\n\n00:12:36.958 --> 00:12:38.958\nThe revenues increase at a higher level,\n\n00:12:38.958 --> 00:12:40.958\ngiving us a healthy margin\n\n00:12:40.958 --> 00:12:44.958\nwhile you're treating a large number of people for free.\n\n00:12:44.958 --> 00:12:46.958\nI think in absolute terms,\n\n00:12:46.958 --> 00:12:49.958\nlast year we earned about 20-odd million dollars,\n\n00:12:49.958 --> 00:12:54.958\nspent about 13 million, with over a 40 percent EBITA.\n\n00:12:54.958 --> 00:13:02.958\n(Applause)\n\n00:13:02.958 --> 00:13:05.958\nBut this really requires going beyond what we do,\n\n00:13:05.958 --> 00:13:08.958\nor what we have done,\n\n00:13:08.958 --> 00:13:11.958\nif you really want to achieve solving this problem of blindness.\n\n00:13:11.958 --> 00:13:15.958\nAnd what we did was a couple of very counter-intuitive things.\n\n00:13:15.958 --> 00:13:18.958\nWe created competition for ourselves,\n\n00:13:18.958 --> 00:13:21.958\nand then we made eye care affordable\n\n00:13:21.958 --> 00:13:24.958\nby making low-cost consumables.\n\n00:13:24.958 --> 00:13:27.958\nWe proactively and systematically\n\n00:13:27.958 --> 00:13:31.958\npromoted these practices to many hospitals in India,\n\n00:13:31.958 --> 00:13:34.958\nmany in our own backyards and then in other parts of the world as well.\n\n00:13:34.958 --> 00:13:38.958\nThe impact of this has been that these hospitals,\n\n00:13:38.958 --> 00:13:41.958\nin the second year after our consultation,\n\n00:13:41.958 --> 00:13:43.958\nare double their output\n\n00:13:43.958 --> 00:13:48.958\nand then achieve financial recovery as well.\n\n00:13:49.958 --> 00:13:52.958\nThe other part was how do you address\n\n00:13:52.958 --> 00:13:56.958\nthis increase in cost of technology?\n\n00:13:56.958 --> 00:13:59.958\nThere was a time when we failed to negotiate\n\n00:13:59.958 --> 00:14:01.958\nthe [intra-ocular lens] prices to be at affordable levels,\n\n00:14:01.958 --> 00:14:05.958\nso we set up a manufacturing unit.\n\n00:14:05.958 --> 00:14:09.958\nAnd then, over time, we were able to bring down the cost significantly\n\n00:14:09.958 --> 00:14:14.958\nto about two percent of what it used to be when we started out.\n\n00:14:14.958 --> 00:14:18.958\nToday, we believe we have about seven percent of the global market,\n\n00:14:18.958 --> 00:14:22.958\nand they're used in about 120-odd countries.\n\n00:14:22.958 --> 00:14:27.958\nTo conclude, I mean, what we do, does it have a broader relevance,\n\n00:14:27.958 --> 00:14:32.958\nor is it just India or developing countries?\n\n00:14:32.958 --> 00:14:38.958\nSo to address this, we studied UK versus Aravind.\n\n00:14:39.958 --> 00:14:42.958\nWhat it shows is that we do roughly about 60 percent\n\n00:14:42.958 --> 00:14:45.958\nof the volume of what the UK does,\n\n00:14:45.958 --> 00:14:48.958\nnear a half-million surgeries as a whole country.\n\n00:14:48.958 --> 00:14:51.958\nAnd we do about 300,000.\n\n00:14:51.958 --> 00:14:54.958\nAnd then we train about 50 ophthalmologists\n\n00:14:54.958 --> 00:14:57.958\nagainst the 70 trained by them,\n\n00:14:57.958 --> 00:15:00.958\ncomparable quality, both in training and in patient care.\n\n00:15:00.958 --> 00:15:03.958\nSo we're really comparing apples to apples.\n\n00:15:03.958 --> 00:15:05.958\nWe looked at cost.\n\n00:15:05.958 --> 00:15:07.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:15:07.958 --> 00:15:13.958\n(Applause)\n\n00:15:13.958 --> 00:15:15.958\nSo, I think it is simple to say\n\n00:15:15.958 --> 00:15:19.958\njust because the U.K. isn't India the difference is happening.\n\n00:15:19.958 --> 00:15:21.958\nI think there is more to it.\n\n00:15:21.958 --> 00:15:23.958\nI mean, I think one has to look at other aspects as well.\n\n00:15:23.958 --> 00:15:25.958\nMaybe there is --\n\n00:15:25.958 --> 00:15:29.958\nthe solution to the cost could be in productivity,\n\n00:15:29.958 --> 00:15:32.958\nmaybe in efficiency, in the clinical process,\n\n00:15:32.958 --> 00:15:35.958\nor in how much they pay for the lenses or consumables,\n\n00:15:35.958 --> 00:15:38.958\nor regulations, their defensive practice.\n\n00:15:38.958 --> 00:15:41.958\nSo, I think decoding this can probably bring\n\n00:15:41.958 --> 00:15:46.958\nanswers to most developed countries\n\n00:15:46.958 --> 00:15:48.958\nincluding the U.S., and maybe\n\n00:15:48.958 --> 00:15:51.958\nObama's ratings can go up again.\n\n00:15:51.958 --> 00:15:54.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:15:55.958 --> 00:15:59.958\nAnother insight, which, again, I want to leave with you,\n\n00:15:59.958 --> 00:16:02.958\nin conditions where the problem is very large,\n\n00:16:02.958 --> 00:16:04.958\nwhich cuts across all economic strata,\n\n00:16:04.958 --> 00:16:07.958\nwhere we have a good solution,\n\n00:16:07.958 --> 00:16:09.958\nI think the process I described,\n\n00:16:09.958 --> 00:16:13.958\nyou know, productivity, quality, patient-centered care,\n\n00:16:13.958 --> 00:16:16.958\ncan give an answer,\n\n00:16:16.958 --> 00:16:18.958\nand there are many which fit this paradigm.\n\n00:16:18.958 --> 00:16:21.958\nYou take dentistry, hearing aid, maternity and so on.\n\n00:16:21.958 --> 00:16:24.958\nThere are many where this paradigm can now play,\n\n00:16:24.958 --> 00:16:26.958\nbut I think probably one of the most challenging things\n\n00:16:26.958 --> 00:16:28.958\nis on the softer side.\n\n00:16:28.958 --> 00:16:30.958\nNow, how do you create compassion?\n\n00:16:30.958 --> 00:16:32.958\nNow, how do you make people own the problem,\n\n00:16:32.958 --> 00:16:34.958\nwant to do something about it?\n\n00:16:34.958 --> 00:16:36.958\nThere are a bit harder issues.\n\n00:16:36.958 --> 00:16:40.958\nAnd I'm sure people in this crowd can probably find the solutions to these.\n\n00:16:40.958 --> 00:16:43.958\nSo I want to end my talk leaving this thought and challenge to you.\n\n00:16:43.958 --> 00:16:46.958\nDr. V: When you grow in spiritual consciousness,\n\n00:16:46.958 --> 00:16:49.958\nwe identify with all that is in the world\n\n00:16:49.958 --> 00:16:52.958\nso there is no exploitation.\n\n00:16:52.958 --> 00:16:54.958\nIt is ourselves we are helping.\n\n00:16:54.958 --> 00:16:57.958\nIt is ourselves we are healing.\n\n00:16:57.958 --> 00:16:59.958\nTR: Thank you very much.\n\n00:16:59.958 --> 00:17:16.958\n(Applause)"}, {"title": "Pop culture in the Arab world", "duration": "305", "url":

Because this is my first time at TED, I've decided to bring along an old friend to help break the ice a bit. Yes. That's right. This is Barbie. She's 50 years old. And she's looking as young as ever. (Laughter) But I'd also like to introduce you to what may be an unfamiliar face. This is Fulla. Fulla is the Arab world's answer to Barbie.Now, according to proponents of the clash of civilizations, Barbie and Fulla occupy these completely separate spheres. They have different interests. They have divergent values. And should they ever come in contact ... well, I've got to tell you, it's just not going to be pretty.My experience, however, in the Islamic world is very different. Where I work, in the Arab region, people are busy taking up Western innovations and changing them into things which are neither conventionally Western, nor are they traditionally Islamic. I want to show you two examples. The first is 4Shbab. It means \"for youth\" and it's a new Arab TV channel.(Video): Video clips from across the globe. The USA.\u266b I am not afraid to stand alone \u266b\u266b I am not afraid to stand alone, if Allah is by my side \u266b\u266b I am not afraid to stand alone \u266b\u266b Everything will be all right \u266b\u266b I am not afraid to stand alone \u266bThe Arab world.(Music)\u266b She was preserved by modesty of the religion \u266b \u266b She was adorned by the light of the Quran \u266bShereen El Feki: 4Shbab has been dubbed Islamic MTV. Its creator, who is an Egyptian TV producer called Ahmed Abu Ha\u00efba, wants young people to be inspired by Islam to lead better lives. He reckons the best way to get that message across is to use the enormously popular medium of music videos. 4Shbab was set up as an alternative to existing Arab music channels. And they look something like this. (Music)That, by the way is Haifa Wehbe. She's a Lebanese pop star and pan-Arab pin-up girl. In the world of 4Shbab, it's not about bump and grind. But it's not about fire and brimstone either. Its videos are intended to show a kinder, gentler face of Islam, for young people to deal with life's challenges.Now, my second example is for a slightly younger crowd. And it's called \"The 99.\" Now, these are the world's first Islamic superheroes. They were created by a Kuwaiti psychologist called Naif Al Mutawa. And his desire is to rescue Islam from images of intolerance, all in a child-friendly format. \"The 99.\" The characters are meant to embody the 99 attributes of Allah: justice, wisdom, mercy, among others. So, for example, there is the character of Noora. She is meant to have the power to look inside people and see the good and bad in everyone. Another character called Jami has the ability to create fantastic inventions.Now, \"The 99\" is not just a comic book. It's now a theme park. There is an animated series in the works. And by this time next year, the likes of Superman and Wonder Woman will have joined forces with \"The 99\" to beat injustice wherever they find it.\"The 99\" and 4Shbab are just two of many examples of this sort of Islamic cross-cultural hybridization. We're not talking here about a clash of civilizations. Nor is it some sort of indistinguishable mash. I like to think of it as a mesh of civilizations, in which the strands of different cultures are intertwined.Now, while 4Shbab and \"The 99\" may look new and shiny, there is actually a very long tradition of this. Throughout its history, Islam has borrowed and adapted from other civilizations both ancient and modern. After all, it's the Quran which encourages us to do this: \"We made you into nations and tribes so that you could learn from one another.\" And to my mind, those are pretty wise words, no matter what your creed. Thank you. (Applause)", "id": 710, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:13.958 --> 00:00:17.958\nHello, everyone.

At the time he was looking after the rights of political prisoners in Italian jails. He asked me if I wanted to interview the Red Brigades. Now, as many of you may remember, the Red Brigades was a terrorist, Marxist organization which was very active in Italy from the 1960s until the mid-1980s. As part of their strategy the Red Brigades never spoke with anybody, not even with their lawyers. They sat in silence through their trails, waving occasionally at family and friends.In 1993 they declared the end of the armed struggle. And they drew a list of people with whom they would talk, and tell their story. And I was one of those people. When I asked my friend why the Red Brigades want to talk to me, he said that the female members of the organization had actually supported my name. In particular, one person had put it forward. She was my childhood friend. She had joined the Red Brigades and became a leader of the organization.Naturally, I didn't know that until the day she was arrested. In fact, I read it in the newspaper. At the time of the phone call I just had a baby, I successfully completed a management buyout to the company I was working with, and the last thing I wanted to do was to go back home and touring the high-security prisons. But this is exactly what I did because I wanted to know what had turned my best friend into a terrorist, and why she'd never tried to recruit me. (Laughter) (Applause)So, this is exactly what I did. Now, I found the answer very quickly. I actually had failed the psychological profiling of a terrorist. The center committee of the Red Brigades had judged me too single-minded and too opinionated to become a good terrorist. My friend, on the other hand, she was a good terrorist because she was very good at following orders. She also embraced violence. Because she believed that the only way to unblock what, at the time, was known as a blocked democracy, Italy, a country run by the same party for 35 years was the arms struggle.At the same time, while I was interviewing the Red Brigades, I also discovered that their life was not ruled by politics or ideology, but actually was ruled by economics. They were constantly short of cash. They were constantly searching for cash. Now, contrary to what many people believe, terrorism is actually a very expensive business. I'll give you an idea. In the 1970s, the turnover of the Red Brigades on a yearly basis was seven million dollars. This is roughly between 100 and 150 million, today.Now, you know, if you live underground it's really hard to produce this amount of money. But this also explains why, when I was interviewing the Red Brigades, and then, later on, other arms organizations, including members of al-Zarqawi group in the Middle East, everybody was extremely reluctant to talk about ideology, or politics. Because they had no idea. The political vision of a terrorist organization is decided by the leadership, which, generally, is never more than five to seven people. All the others do, day in and day out, is search for money.Once, for example, I was interviewing this part-timer from the Red Brigades. It was a psychiatrist. He loved sailing. He was a really keen sailor. And he had this beautiful boat. And he told me that the best time of his life was when he was a member of the Red Brigades and he went sailing, every summer, back and forth from Lebanon, where he would pick up Soviet weapons from the PLO, and then carry them all the way to Sardinia where the other arms organization from Europe would go and take their share of the arms. For that service the Red Brigades were actually paid a fee, which went to fund their organization.So, because I am a trained economist and I think in economic terms, all of the sudden I thought, maybe there is something here. Maybe there is a link, a commercial link, between one organization and another one. But it was only when I interviewed Mario Moretti, the head of the Red Brigades, the man who kidnapped and killed Aldo Moro, Italian former prime minister, that I finally realized that terrorism is actually business. I was having lunch with him in a high-security prison in Italy. And as we were eating, I had the distinct feeling that I was back in the city of London, having lunch with a fellow banker or an economist. This guy thought in the same way I did.So, I decided that I wanted to investigate the economics of terrorism. Naturally, nobody wanted to fund my research. In fact, I think many people thought that I was a bit crazy. You know, that woman that goes around to foundations asking for money, thinking about the economics of terrorism. So, in the end, I took a decision that, in retrospect, did change my life. I sold my company, and funded the research myself.And what I discovered is this parallel reality, another international economic system, which runs parallel to our own, which has been created by arms organizations since the end of World War II. And what is even more shocking is that this system has followed, step by step, the evolution of our own system, of our Western capitalism. And there are three main stages. The first one is the state sponsor of terrorism.The second one is the privatization of terrorism. And the third, of course, is the globalization of terrorism. So, state sponsor of terrorism, feature of the Cold War. This is when the two superpowers were fighting a war by proxy, along the periphery of the sphere of influence, fully funding arms organizations. A mix of legal and illegal activities is used. So, the link between crime and terror is established very early on.And here is the best example, the Contras in Nicaragua, created by the CIA, legally funded by the U.S. Congress, illegally funded by the Reagan administration via covert operation, for example, the Iran-Contra Affair. Then comes the late 1970s, early '80s, and some groups successfully carry out the privatization of terrorism. So, they gain independence from the sponsor, and start funding themselves.Now, again we see a mix of legal and illegal activities. So, Arafat used to get a percentage of the smuggling of hashish from Bek\u00e1a Valley, which is the valley between Lebanon and Syria. And the IRA, which control the private transportation system in Northern Ireland, did exactly the same thing. So, every single time that somebody got into a taxi in Belfast without knowing, actually, was funding the IRA.But the great change came, of course, with globalization and deregulation. This is when arms organization were able to link up, also financially, with each other. But above all, they started to do serious business with the world of crime. And together they money-laundered their dirty business through the same channel. This is when we see the birth of the transnational arms organization Al Qaeda. This is an organization that can raise money across border. But also that is able to carry out attacks in more than one country.Now, deregulation also brought back rogue economics. So what is rogue economics? Rogue economics is a force which is constantly lurking in the background of history. It comes back at times of great transformation, globalization being one of those transformations. It is at this times in which politics actually loses control of the economy, and the economy becomes a rogue force working against us. It has happened before in history. It has happened with the fall of the Roman Empire. It has happened with Industrial Revolution. And it actually happened again, with the fall of the Berlin wall.Now, I calculated how big was this international economic system composed by crime, terror, and illegal economy, before 9-11. And it is a staggering 1.5 trillion dollars. It is trillions, it's not billions. This is about twice the GDP of the United Kingdom, soon will be more, considering where this country is going. (Laughter)Now, until 9-11, the bulk of all this money flew into the U.S. economy because the bulk of the money was denominated in U.S. dollars and the money laundering was taking place inside the United States. The entry point, of course, of most of this money were the off-shore facilities. So, this was a vital injection of cash into the U.S. economy. Now, when I went to look at the figures of the U.S. money supply, the U.S. money supply is the amount of dollars that the Federal Reserve prints every year in order to satisfy the increase in the demand for dollars, which, of course, reflects the growth of the economy.So, when I went to look at those figures, I noted that since the late 1960s a growing number of these dollars was actually leaving the United States, never to come back. These were money taken out in suitcases or in containers, in cash of course. These were money taken out by criminals and money launderers. These were money taken out to fund the growth of the terror, illegal and criminal economy. So, you see, what is the relationship?The United States actually is a country that is the reserve currency of the world. What does it mean? That means that it has a privilege that other countries do not have. It can borrow against the total amount of dollars in circulation in the world. This privilege is called seigniorage. No other country can do that. All the other countries, for example the United Kingdom, can borrow only against the amount of money in circulation inside its own borders.So, here is the implication of the relationship between the worlds of crime, terror, and illegal economy, and our economy. The U.S. in the 1990s was borrowing against the growth of the terror, illegal and criminal economy. This is how close we are with this world. Now, this situation changed, of course, after 9-11, because George Bush launched the War on Terror. Part of the War on Terror was the introduction of the Patriot Act. Now, many of you know that the Patriot Act is a legislation that greatly reduces the liberties of Americans in order to protect them against terrorism.But there is a section of the Patriot Act which refers specifically to finance. And it is, in fact, an anti-money-laundering legislation. What the Patriot Act did was to prohibit U.S. bank, and U.S.-registered foreign banks from doing any businesses with off-shore facilities. It closed that door between the money laundering in dollars, and the U.S. economy. It also gave the U.S. monetary authorities the right to monitor any dollar transaction taking place anywhere in the world.Now, you can imagine what was the reaction of the international finance and banking. All the bankers said to their clients, \"Get out of the dollars and go and invest somewhere else.\" Now, the Euro was a newly born currency of great opportunity for business, and, of course, for investment. And this is what people did. Nobody wants the U.S. monetary authority to check their relationship, to monitor their relationship with their clientele. The same thing happened, of course, in the world of crime and terror. People simply moved their money-laundering activities away from the United States into Europe.Why did this happen? This happened because the Patriot Act was a unilateral legislation. It was introduced only in the United States. And it was introduced only for the U.S. dollars. In Europe, a similar legislation was not introduced. So, within six months Europe became the epicenter of the money-laundering activities of the world. So, this is how incredible are the relationship between the world of crime and the world of terror, and our own life.So, why did I tell you this story? I told you this story because you must understand that there is a world that goes well beyond the headlines of the newspapers, including the personal relationship that you have with friends and family. You got to question everything that is told to you, including what I just told you today. (Laughter) This is the only way for you to step into the dark side, and have a look at it. And believe me, it's going to be scary. It's going to be frightful, but it's going to enlighten you. And, above all, it's not going to be boring.

00:00:17.958\nactually interacts with our daily life.\n\n00:00:17.958 --> 00:00:21.958\n15 years ago I received a phone call from a friend.\n\n00:00:21.958 --> 00:00:24.958\nAt the time he was looking after the rights of political prisoners\n\n00:00:24.958 --> 00:00:27.958\nin Italian jails.\n\n00:00:27.958 --> 00:00:31.958\nHe asked me if I wanted to interview the Red Brigades.\n\n00:00:31.958 --> 00:00:33.958\nNow, as many of you may remember,\n\n00:00:33.958 --> 00:00:37.958\nthe Red Brigades was a terrorist, Marxist organization\n\n00:00:37.958 --> 00:00:39.958\nwhich was very active in Italy\n\n00:00:39.958 --> 00:00:43.958\nfrom the 1960s until the mid-1980s.\n\n00:00:43.958 --> 00:00:45.958\nAs part of their strategy\n\n00:00:45.958 --> 00:00:49.958\nthe Red Brigades never spoke with anybody, not even with their lawyers.\n\n00:00:49.958 --> 00:00:53.958\nThey sat in silence through their trails,\n\n00:00:53.958 --> 00:00:57.958\nwaving occasionally at family and friends.\n\n00:00:57.958 --> 00:01:03.958\nIn 1993 they declared the end of the armed struggle.\n\n00:01:03.958 --> 00:01:05.958\nAnd they drew a list of people with whom they would talk,\n\n00:01:05.958 --> 00:01:07.958\nand tell their story.\n\n00:01:07.958 --> 00:01:10.958\nAnd I was one of those people.\n\n00:01:10.958 --> 00:01:13.958\nWhen I asked my friend why the Red Brigades want to talk to me,\n\n00:01:13.958 --> 00:01:17.958\nhe said that the female members of the organization\n\n00:01:17.958 --> 00:01:20.958\nhad actually supported my name.\n\n00:01:20.958 --> 00:01:23.958\nIn particular, one person had put it forward.\n\n00:01:23.958 --> 00:01:26.958\nShe was my childhood friend.\n\n00:01:26.958 --> 00:01:28.958\nShe had joined the Red Brigades\n\n00:01:28.958 --> 00:01:31.958\nand became a leader of the organization.\n\n00:01:31.958 --> 00:01:33.958\nNaturally, I didn't know that\n\n00:01:33.958 --> 00:01:35.958\nuntil the day she was arrested.\n\n00:01:35.958 --> 00:01:39.958\nIn fact, I read it in the newspaper.\n\n00:01:39.958 --> 00:01:41.958\nAt the time of the phone call\n\n00:01:41.958 --> 00:01:43.958\nI just had a baby,\n\n00:01:43.958 --> 00:01:45.958\nI successfully completed a management buyout\n\n00:01:45.958 --> 00:01:48.958\nto the company I was working with,\n\n00:01:48.958 --> 00:01:51.958\nand the last thing I wanted to do was to go back home\n\n00:01:51.958 --> 00:01:54.958\nand touring the high-security prisons.\n\n00:01:54.958 --> 00:01:57.958\nBut this is exactly what I did\n\n00:01:57.958 --> 00:01:59.958\nbecause I wanted to know\n\n00:01:59.958 --> 00:02:01.958\nwhat had turned my best friend\n\n00:02:01.958 --> 00:02:03.958\ninto a terrorist,\n\n00:02:03.958 --> 00:02:07.958\nand why she'd never tried to recruit me.\n\n00:02:07.958 --> 00:02:09.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:02:09.958 --> 00:02:12.958\n(Applause)\n\n00:02:12.958 --> 00:02:17.958\nSo, this is exactly what I did.\n\n00:02:17.958 --> 00:02:21.958\nNow, I found the answer very quickly.\n\n00:02:21.958 --> 00:02:23.958\nI actually had failed\n\n00:02:23.958 --> 00:02:26.958\nthe psychological profiling of a terrorist.\n\n00:02:26.958 --> 00:02:28.958\nThe center committee of the Red Brigades\n\n00:02:28.958 --> 00:02:30.958\nhad judged me too single-minded\n\n00:02:30.958 --> 00:02:34.958\nand too opinionated to become a good terrorist.\n\n00:02:34.958 --> 00:02:37.958\nMy friend, on the other hand, she was a good terrorist\n\n00:02:37.958 --> 00:02:40.958\nbecause she was very good at following orders.\n\n00:02:40.958 --> 00:02:43.958\nShe also embraced violence.\n\n00:02:43.958 --> 00:02:45.958\nBecause she believed that the only way\n\n00:02:45.958 --> 00:02:48.958\nto unblock what, at the time,\n\n00:02:48.958 --> 00:02:50.958\nwas known as a blocked democracy,\n\n00:02:50.958 --> 00:02:54.958\nItaly, a country run by the same party for 35 years\n\n00:02:54.958 --> 00:02:58.958\nwas the arms struggle.\n\n00:02:58.958 --> 00:03:01.958\nAt the same time, while I was interviewing the Red Brigades,\n\n00:03:01.958 --> 00:03:04.958\nI also discovered that their life was not ruled\n\n00:03:04.958 --> 00:03:07.958\nby politics or ideology,\n\n00:03:07.958 --> 00:03:10.958\nbut actually was ruled by economics.\n\n00:03:10.958 --> 00:03:13.958\nThey were constantly short of cash.\n\n00:03:13.958 --> 00:03:16.958\nThey were constantly searching for cash.\n\n00:03:16.958 --> 00:03:18.958\nNow, contrary to what many people believe,\n\n00:03:18.958 --> 00:03:22.958\nterrorism is actually a very expensive business.\n\n00:03:22.958 --> 00:03:24.958\nI'll give you an idea.\n\n00:03:24.958 --> 00:03:29.958\nIn the 1970s, the turnover of the Red Brigades\n\n00:03:29.958 --> 00:03:31.958\non a yearly basis\n\n00:03:31.958 --> 00:03:33.958\nwas seven million dollars.\n\n00:03:33.958 --> 00:03:35.958\nThis is roughly between 100\n\n00:03:35.958 --> 00:03:37.958\nand 150 million, today.\n\n00:03:37.958 --> 00:03:40.958\nNow, you know, if you live underground\n\n00:03:40.958 --> 00:03:45.958\nit's really hard to produce this amount of money.\n\n00:03:45.958 --> 00:03:49.958\nBut this also explains why, when I was interviewing the Red Brigades,\n\n00:03:49.958 --> 00:03:52.958\nand then, later on, other arms organizations,\n\n00:03:52.958 --> 00:03:57.958\nincluding members of al-Zarqawi group in the Middle East,\n\n00:03:57.958 --> 00:04:00.958\neverybody was extremely reluctant\n\n00:04:00.958 --> 00:04:03.958\nto talk about ideology, or politics.\n\n00:04:03.958 --> 00:04:05.958\nBecause they had no idea.\n\n00:04:05.958 --> 00:04:09.958\nThe political vision of a terrorist organization\n\n00:04:09.958 --> 00:04:12.958\nis decided by the leadership,\n\n00:04:12.958 --> 00:04:15.958\nwhich, generally, is never more than five to seven people.\n\n00:04:15.958 --> 00:04:18.958\nAll the others do, day in and day out,\n\n00:04:18.958 --> 00:04:20.958\nis search for money.\n\n00:04:20.958 --> 00:04:22.958\nOnce, for example, I was interviewing\n\n00:04:22.958 --> 00:04:25.958\nthis part-timer from the Red Brigades.\n\n00:04:25.958 --> 00:04:27.958\nIt was a psychiatrist. He loved sailing.\n\n00:04:27.958 --> 00:04:31.958\nHe was a really keen sailor. And he had this beautiful boat.\n\n00:04:31.958 --> 00:04:33.958\nAnd he told me that the best time of his life\n\n00:04:33.958 --> 00:04:36.958\nwas when he was a member of the Red Brigades\n\n00:04:36.958 --> 00:04:38.958\nand he went sailing, every summer, back and forth\n\n00:04:38.958 --> 00:04:40.958\nfrom Lebanon, where he would pick up\n\n00:04:40.958 --> 00:04:42.958\nSoviet weapons from the PLO,\n\n00:04:42.958 --> 00:04:45.958\nand then carry them all the way to Sardinia\n\n00:04:45.958 --> 00:04:48.958\nwhere the other arms organization from Europe would go\n\n00:04:48.958 --> 00:04:51.958\nand take their share of the arms.\n\n00:04:51.958 --> 00:04:55.958\nFor that service the Red Brigades were actually paid a fee,\n\n00:04:55.958 --> 00:04:58.958\nwhich went to fund their organization.\n\n00:04:58.958 --> 00:05:01.958\nSo, because I am a trained economist\n\n00:05:01.958 --> 00:05:03.958\nand I think in economic terms,\n\n00:05:03.958 --> 00:05:05.958\nall of the sudden I thought,\n\n00:05:05.958 --> 00:05:07.958\nmaybe there is something here.\n\n00:05:07.958 --> 00:05:09.958\nMaybe there is a link, a commercial link,\n\n00:05:09.958 --> 00:05:13.958\nbetween one organization and another one.\n\n00:05:13.958 --> 00:05:16.958\nBut it was only when I interviewed\n\n00:05:16.958 --> 00:05:20.958\nMario Moretti, the head of the Red Brigades,\n\n00:05:20.958 --> 00:05:23.958\nthe man who kidnapped and killed Aldo Moro,\n\n00:05:23.958 --> 00:05:26.958\nItalian former prime minister,\n\n00:05:26.958 --> 00:05:28.958\nthat I finally realized\n\n00:05:28.958 --> 00:05:31.958\nthat terrorism is actually business.\n\n00:05:31.958 --> 00:05:33.958\nI was having lunch with him\n\n00:05:33.958 --> 00:05:35.958\nin a high-security prison in Italy.\n\n00:05:35.958 --> 00:05:38.958\nAnd as we were eating,\n\n00:05:38.958 --> 00:05:40.958\nI had the distinct feeling\n\n00:05:40.958 --> 00:05:43.958\nthat I was back in the city of London,\n\n00:05:43.958 --> 00:05:47.958\nhaving lunch with a fellow banker or an economist.\n\n00:05:47.958 --> 00:05:51.958\nThis guy thought in the same way I did.\n\n00:05:51.958 --> 00:05:57.958\nSo, I decided that I wanted to investigate the economics of terrorism.\n\n00:05:57.958 --> 00:06:01.958\nNaturally, nobody wanted to fund my research.\n\n00:06:01.958 --> 00:06:03.958\nIn fact, I think many people thought that I was a bit crazy.\n\n00:06:03.958 --> 00:06:06.958\nYou know, that woman that goes around to foundations\n\n00:06:06.958 --> 00:06:10.958\nasking for money, thinking about the economics of terrorism.\n\n00:06:10.958 --> 00:06:13.958\nSo, in the end, I took a decision\n\n00:06:13.958 --> 00:06:16.958\nthat, in retrospect, did change my life.\n\n00:06:16.958 --> 00:06:18.958\nI sold my company,\n\n00:06:18.958 --> 00:06:21.958\nand funded the research myself.\n\n00:06:21.958 --> 00:06:23.958\nAnd what I discovered\n\n00:06:23.958 --> 00:06:25.958\nis this parallel reality,\n\n00:06:25.958 --> 00:06:29.958\nanother international economic system,\n\n00:06:29.958 --> 00:06:32.958\nwhich runs parallel to our own,\n\n00:06:32.958 --> 00:06:34.958\nwhich has been created by arms organizations\n\n00:06:34.958 --> 00:06:36.958\nsince the end of World War II.\n\n00:06:36.958 --> 00:06:38.958\nAnd what is even more shocking\n\n00:06:38.958 --> 00:06:42.958\nis that this system\n\n00:06:42.958 --> 00:06:45.958\nhas followed, step by step, the evolution\n\n00:06:45.958 --> 00:06:47.958\nof our own system,\n\n00:06:47.958 --> 00:06:49.958\nof our Western capitalism.\n\n00:06:49.958 --> 00:06:52.958\nAnd there are three main stages.\n\n00:06:52.958 --> 00:06:55.958\nThe first one is the state sponsor of terrorism.\n\n00:06:55.958 --> 00:06:58.958\nThe second one is the privatization of terrorism.\n\n00:06:58.958 --> 00:07:02.958\nAnd the third, of course, is the globalization of terrorism.\n\n00:07:02.958 --> 00:07:05.958\nSo, state sponsor of terrorism,\n\n00:07:05.958 --> 00:07:07.958\nfeature of the Cold War.\n\n00:07:07.958 --> 00:07:09.958\nThis is when the two superpowers were fighting\n\n00:07:09.958 --> 00:07:11.958\na war by proxy,\n\n00:07:11.958 --> 00:07:14.958\nalong the periphery of the sphere of influence,\n\n00:07:14.958 --> 00:07:17.958\nfully funding arms organizations.\n\n00:07:17.958 --> 00:07:20.958\nA mix of legal and illegal activities is used.\n\n00:07:20.958 --> 00:07:23.958\nSo, the link between crime and terror\n\n00:07:23.958 --> 00:07:26.958\nis established very early on.\n\n00:07:26.958 --> 00:07:28.958\nAnd here is the best example,\n\n00:07:28.958 --> 00:07:31.958\nthe Contras in Nicaragua, created by the CIA,\n\n00:07:31.958 --> 00:07:34.958\nlegally funded by the U.S. Congress,\n\n00:07:34.958 --> 00:07:37.958\nillegally funded by the Reagan administration\n\n00:07:37.958 --> 00:07:43.958\nvia covert operation, for example, the Iran-Contra Affair.\n\n00:07:43.958 --> 00:07:46.958\nThen comes the late 1970s, early '80s,\n\n00:07:46.958 --> 00:07:49.958\nand some groups successfully carry out\n\n00:07:49.958 --> 00:07:51.958\nthe privatization of terrorism.\n\n00:07:51.958 --> 00:07:54.958\nSo, they gain independence from the sponsor,\n\n00:07:54.958 --> 00:07:58.958\nand start funding themselves.\n\n00:07:58.958 --> 00:08:03.958\nNow, again we see a mix of legal and illegal activities.\n\n00:08:03.958 --> 00:08:06.958\nSo, Arafat used to get a percentage\n\n00:08:06.958 --> 00:08:09.958\nof the smuggling of hashish\n\n00:08:09.958 --> 00:08:13.958\nfrom Bek\u00e1a Valley, which is the valley between Lebanon and Syria.\n\n00:08:13.958 --> 00:08:17.958\nAnd the IRA, which control the private transportation system\n\n00:08:17.958 --> 00:08:20.958\nin Northern Ireland, did exactly the same thing.\n\n00:08:20.958 --> 00:08:22.958\nSo, every single time\n\n00:08:22.958 --> 00:08:25.958\nthat somebody got into a taxi in Belfast\n\n00:08:25.958 --> 00:08:27.958\nwithout knowing, actually,\n\n00:08:27.958 --> 00:08:30.958\nwas funding the IRA.\n\n00:08:30.958 --> 00:08:32.958\nBut the great change came, of course,\n\n00:08:32.958 --> 00:08:35.958\nwith globalization and deregulation.\n\n00:08:35.958 --> 00:08:38.958\nThis is when arms organization were able to link up,\n\n00:08:38.958 --> 00:08:40.958\nalso financially, with each other.\n\n00:08:40.958 --> 00:08:42.958\nBut above all, they started to do\n\n00:08:42.958 --> 00:08:45.958\nserious business with the world of crime.\n\n00:08:45.958 --> 00:08:47.958\nAnd together they money-laundered\n\n00:08:47.958 --> 00:08:51.958\ntheir dirty business through the same channel.\n\n00:08:51.958 --> 00:08:54.958\nThis is when we see the birth of the transnational\n\n00:08:54.958 --> 00:08:57.958\narms organization Al Qaeda.\n\n00:08:57.958 --> 00:09:00.958\nThis is an organization that can raise money across border.\n\n00:09:00.958 --> 00:09:03.958\nBut also that is able to carry out attacks\n\n00:09:03.958 --> 00:09:06.958\nin more than one country.\n\n00:09:06.958 --> 00:09:09.958\nNow, deregulation also brought back\n\n00:09:09.958 --> 00:09:11.958\nrogue economics.\n\n00:09:11.958 --> 00:09:13.958\nSo what is rogue economics?\n\n00:09:13.958 --> 00:09:15.958\nRogue economics is a force which is constantly\n\n00:09:15.958 --> 00:09:19.958\nlurking in the background of history.\n\n00:09:19.958 --> 00:09:22.958\nIt comes back at times of great transformation,\n\n00:09:22.958 --> 00:09:25.958\nglobalization being one of those transformations.\n\n00:09:25.958 --> 00:09:28.958\nIt is at this times in which\n\n00:09:28.958 --> 00:09:31.958\npolitics actually loses control of the economy,\n\n00:09:31.958 --> 00:09:34.958\nand the economy becomes a rogue force\n\n00:09:34.958 --> 00:09:36.958\nworking against us.\n\n00:09:36.958 --> 00:09:37.958\nIt has happened before in history.\n\n00:09:37.958 --> 00:09:41.958\nIt has happened with the fall of the Roman Empire.\n\n00:09:41.958 --> 00:09:43.958\nIt has happened with Industrial Revolution.\n\n00:09:43.958 --> 00:09:48.958\nAnd it actually happened again, with the fall of the Berlin wall.\n\n00:09:48.958 --> 00:09:53.958\nNow, I calculated how big was this international\n\n00:09:53.958 --> 00:09:55.958\neconomic system composed by crime,\n\n00:09:55.958 --> 00:09:58.958\nterror, and illegal economy,\n\n00:09:58.958 --> 00:10:00.958\nbefore 9-11.\n\n00:10:00.958 --> 00:10:05.958\nAnd it is a staggering 1.5 trillion dollars.\n\n00:10:05.958 --> 00:10:07.958\nIt is trillions, it's not billions.\n\n00:10:07.958 --> 00:10:10.958\nThis is about twice the GDP of the United Kingdom,\n\n00:10:10.958 --> 00:10:12.958\nsoon will be more,\n\n00:10:12.958 --> 00:10:14.958\nconsidering where this country is going.\n\n00:10:14.958 --> 00:10:17.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:10:17.958 --> 00:10:19.958\nNow, until 9-11,\n\n00:10:19.958 --> 00:10:21.958\nthe bulk of all this money\n\n00:10:21.958 --> 00:10:23.958\nflew into the U.S. economy\n\n00:10:23.958 --> 00:10:27.958\nbecause the bulk of the money was denominated in U.S. dollars\n\n00:10:27.958 --> 00:10:30.958\nand the money laundering was taking place\n\n00:10:30.958 --> 00:10:32.958\ninside the United States.\n\n00:10:32.958 --> 00:10:35.958\nThe entry point, of course, of most of this money\n\n00:10:35.958 --> 00:10:37.958\nwere the off-shore facilities.\n\n00:10:37.958 --> 00:10:41.958\nSo, this was a vital injection of cash\n\n00:10:41.958 --> 00:10:44.958\ninto the U.S. economy.\n\n00:10:44.958 --> 00:10:49.958\nNow, when I went to look at the figures of the U.S. money supply,\n\n00:10:49.958 --> 00:10:51.958\nthe U.S. money supply is the amount\n\n00:10:51.958 --> 00:10:54.958\nof dollars that the Federal Reserve\n\n00:10:54.958 --> 00:10:56.958\nprints every year\n\n00:10:56.958 --> 00:10:58.958\nin order to satisfy\n\n00:10:58.958 --> 00:11:01.958\nthe increase in the demand for dollars,\n\n00:11:01.958 --> 00:11:03.958\nwhich, of course, reflects the growth\n\n00:11:03.958 --> 00:11:05.958\nof the economy.\n\n00:11:05.958 --> 00:11:09.958\nSo, when I went to look at those figures, I noted that since the late 1960s\n\n00:11:09.958 --> 00:11:13.958\na growing number of these dollars\n\n00:11:13.958 --> 00:11:15.958\nwas actually leaving the United States,\n\n00:11:15.958 --> 00:11:18.958\nnever to come back.\n\n00:11:18.958 --> 00:11:20.958\nThese were money taken out\n\n00:11:20.958 --> 00:11:24.958\nin suitcases or in containers, in cash of course.\n\n00:11:24.958 --> 00:11:27.958\nThese were money taken out by criminals and money launderers.\n\n00:11:27.958 --> 00:11:30.958\nThese were money taken out to fund\n\n00:11:30.958 --> 00:11:32.958\nthe growth of the terror,\n\n00:11:32.958 --> 00:11:36.958\nillegal and criminal economy.\n\n00:11:36.958 --> 00:11:40.958\nSo, you see, what is the relationship?\n\n00:11:40.958 --> 00:11:44.958\nThe United States actually is a country\n\n00:11:44.958 --> 00:11:48.958\nthat is the reserve currency of the world.\n\n00:11:48.958 --> 00:11:50.958\nWhat does it mean? That means that\n\n00:11:50.958 --> 00:11:53.958\nit has a privilege that other countries do not have.\n\n00:11:53.958 --> 00:11:57.958\nIt can borrow against the total amount of dollars\n\n00:11:57.958 --> 00:11:59.958\nin circulation in the world.\n\n00:11:59.958 --> 00:12:02.958\nThis privilege is called seigniorage.\n\n00:12:02.958 --> 00:12:05.958\nNo other country can do that.\n\n00:12:05.958 --> 00:12:07.958\nAll the other countries, for example the United Kingdom,\n\n00:12:07.958 --> 00:12:11.958\ncan borrow only against the amount of money\n\n00:12:11.958 --> 00:12:15.958\nin circulation inside its own borders.\n\n00:12:15.958 --> 00:12:17.958\nSo, here is the implication of the relationship\n\n00:12:17.958 --> 00:12:22.958\nbetween the worlds of crime, terror, and illegal economy, and our economy.\n\n00:12:22.958 --> 00:12:25.958\nThe U.S. in the 1990s\n\n00:12:25.958 --> 00:12:27.958\nwas borrowing against the growth\n\n00:12:27.958 --> 00:12:31.958\nof the terror, illegal and criminal economy.\n\n00:12:31.958 --> 00:12:36.958\nThis is how close we are with this world.\n\n00:12:36.958 --> 00:12:38.958\nNow, this situation changed, of course, after 9-11,\n\n00:12:38.958 --> 00:12:41.958\nbecause George Bush launched the War on Terror.\n\n00:12:41.958 --> 00:12:43.958\nPart of the War on Terror\n\n00:12:43.958 --> 00:12:46.958\nwas the introduction of the Patriot Act.\n\n00:12:46.958 --> 00:12:48.958\nNow, many of you know that the Patriot Act\n\n00:12:48.958 --> 00:12:51.958\nis a legislation that greatly reduces\n\n00:12:51.958 --> 00:12:54.958\nthe liberties of Americans in order to protect them\n\n00:12:54.958 --> 00:12:56.958\nagainst terrorism.\n\n00:12:56.958 --> 00:12:58.958\nBut there is a section of the Patriot Act\n\n00:12:58.958 --> 00:13:00.958\nwhich refers specifically to finance.\n\n00:13:00.958 --> 00:13:04.958\nAnd it is, in fact, an anti-money-laundering legislation.\n\n00:13:04.958 --> 00:13:06.958\nWhat the Patriot Act did was\n\n00:13:06.958 --> 00:13:08.958\nto prohibit U.S. bank,\n\n00:13:08.958 --> 00:13:10.958\nand U.S.-registered foreign banks\n\n00:13:10.958 --> 00:13:14.958\nfrom doing any businesses with off-shore facilities.\n\n00:13:14.958 --> 00:13:17.958\nIt closed that door between the money laundering\n\n00:13:17.958 --> 00:13:20.958\nin dollars, and the U.S. economy.\n\n00:13:20.958 --> 00:13:25.958\nIt also gave the U.S. monetary authorities\n\n00:13:25.958 --> 00:13:28.958\nthe right to monitor any dollar transaction\n\n00:13:28.958 --> 00:13:32.958\ntaking place anywhere in the world.\n\n00:13:32.958 --> 00:13:34.958\nNow, you can imagine what was the reaction of the international\n\n00:13:34.958 --> 00:13:36.958\nfinance and banking.\n\n00:13:36.958 --> 00:13:39.958\nAll the bankers said to their clients,\n\n00:13:39.958 --> 00:13:42.958\n\"Get out of the dollars and go and invest somewhere else.\"\n\n00:13:42.958 --> 00:13:45.958\nNow, the Euro was a newly born currency\n\n00:13:45.958 --> 00:13:49.958\nof great opportunity for business, and, of course, for investment.\n\n00:13:49.958 --> 00:13:51.958\nAnd this is what people did.\n\n00:13:51.958 --> 00:13:53.958\nNobody wants the U.S. monetary authority\n\n00:13:53.958 --> 00:13:55.958\nto check their relationship,\n\n00:13:55.958 --> 00:13:59.958\nto monitor their relationship with their clientele.\n\n00:13:59.958 --> 00:14:01.958\nThe same thing happened, of course,\n\n00:14:01.958 --> 00:14:05.958\nin the world of crime and terror.\n\n00:14:05.958 --> 00:14:10.958\nPeople simply moved their money-laundering activities\n\n00:14:10.958 --> 00:14:13.958\naway from the United States\n\n00:14:13.958 --> 00:14:16.958\ninto Europe.\n\n00:14:16.958 --> 00:14:18.958\nWhy did this happen? This happened because\n\n00:14:18.958 --> 00:14:21.958\nthe Patriot Act was a unilateral legislation.\n\n00:14:21.958 --> 00:14:23.958\nIt was introduced only in the United States.\n\n00:14:23.958 --> 00:14:26.958\nAnd it was introduced only for the U.S. dollars.\n\n00:14:26.958 --> 00:14:28.958\nIn Europe, a similar legislation\n\n00:14:28.958 --> 00:14:30.958\nwas not introduced.\n\n00:14:30.958 --> 00:14:32.958\nSo, within six months\n\n00:14:32.958 --> 00:14:34.958\nEurope became the epicenter\n\n00:14:34.958 --> 00:14:37.958\nof the money-laundering activities\n\n00:14:37.958 --> 00:14:40.958\nof the world.\n\n00:14:40.958 --> 00:14:44.958\nSo, this is how incredible are the relationship\n\n00:14:44.958 --> 00:14:46.958\nbetween the world of crime\n\n00:14:46.958 --> 00:14:48.958\nand the world of terror,\n\n00:14:48.958 --> 00:14:51.958\nand our own life.\n\n00:14:51.958 --> 00:14:53.958\nSo, why did I tell you this story?\n\n00:14:53.958 --> 00:14:55.958\nI told you this story because you\n\n00:14:55.958 --> 00:14:58.958\nmust understand that there is a world\n\n00:14:58.958 --> 00:15:02.958\nthat goes well beyond the headlines of the newspapers,\n\n00:15:02.958 --> 00:15:04.958\nincluding the personal relationship that you have\n\n00:15:04.958 --> 00:15:07.958\nwith friends and family.\n\n00:15:07.958 --> 00:15:10.958\nYou got to question everything that is told to you,\n\n00:15:10.958 --> 00:15:12.958\nincluding what I just told you today.\n\n00:15:12.958 --> 00:15:14.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:15:14.958 --> 00:15:16.958\nThis is the only way for you\n\n00:15:16.958 --> 00:15:19.958\nto step into the dark side, and have a look at it.\n\n00:15:19.958 --> 00:15:21.958\nAnd believe me,\n\n00:15:21.958 --> 00:15:23.958\nit's going to be scary.\n\n00:15:23.958 --> 00:15:26.958\nIt's going to be frightful, but it's going to enlighten you.\n\n00:15:26.958 --> 00:15:29.958\nAnd, above all, it's not going to be boring.\n\n00:15:29.958 --> 00:15:31.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:15:31.958 --> 00:15:35.958\n(Applause)"}, {"title": "Photographing the hidden story", "duration": "680", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/ryan_lobo_through_the_lens_of_compassion", "transcript": "My name is Ryan Lobo, and I've been involved in the documentary filmmaking business all over the world for the last 10 years. During the process of making these films I found myself taking photographs, often much to the annoyance of the video cameramen.I found this photography of mine almost compulsive. And at the end of a shoot, I would sometimes feel that I had photographs that told a better story than a sometimes-sensational documentary. I felt, when I had my photographs, that I was holding on to something true, regardless of agendas or politics. In 2007, I traveled to three war zones. I traveled to Iraq, Afghanistan and Liberia. And over there I experienced other people's suffering, up close and personal, immersed myself in some rather intense and emotional stories, and at times I experienced great fear for my own life.As always, I would return to Bangalore, and often to animated discussions at friend's homes, where we would discuss various issues while they complained bitterly about the new pub timings, where a drink often cost more than what they'd paid their 14-year-old maid. I would feel very isolated during these discussions. But at the same time, I questioned myself and my own integrity and purpose in storytelling. And I decided that I had compromised, just like my friends in those discussions, where we told stories in contexts we made excuses for, rather than taking responsibility for.I won't go into details about what led to a decision I made, but let's just say it involved alcohol, cigarettes, other substances and a woman. (Laughter) I basically decided that it was I, not the camera or the network, or anything that lay outside myself, that was the only instrument in storytelling truly worth tuning. In my life, when I tried to achieve things like success or recognition, they eluded me. Paradoxically, when I let go of these objectives, and worked from a place of compassion and purpose, looking for excellence, rather than the results of it, everything arrived on its own, including fulfillment.Photography transcended culture, including my own. And it is, for me, a language which expressed the intangible, and gives voice to people and stories without. I invite you into three recent stories of mine, which are about this way of looking, if you will, which I believe exemplify the tenets of what I like to call compassion in storytelling.In 2007 I went to Liberia, where a group of my friends and I did an independent, self-funded film, still in progress, on a very legendary and brutal war-lord named General Butt Naked. His real name is Joshua, and he's pictured here in a cell where he once used to torture and murder people, including children. Joshua claims to have personally killed more than 10,000 people during Liberia's civil war. He got his name from fighting stark naked. And he is probably the most prolific mass murderer alive on Earth today.This woman witnessed the General murdering her brother. Joshua commanded his child-soldiers to commit unspeakable crimes, and enforced his command with great brutality. Today many of these children are addicted to drugs like heroin, and they are destitute, like these young men in the image. How do you live with yourself if you know you've committed horrific crimes? Today the General is a baptized Christian evangelist. And he's on a mission.We accompanied Joshua, as he walked the Earth, visiting villages where he had once killed and raped. He seeked forgiveness, and he claims to endeavor to improve the lives of his child-soldiers. During this expedition I expected him to be killed outright, and us as well. But what I saw opened my eyes to an idea of forgiveness which I never thought possible. In the midst of incredible poverty and loss, people who had nothing absolved a man who had taken everything from them. He begs for forgiveness, and receives it from the same woman whose brother he murdered. Senegalese, the young man seated on the wheelchair here, was once a child soldier, under the General's command, until he disobeyed orders, and the General shot off both his legs. He forgives the General in this image. He risked his life as he walked up to people whose families he'd murdered.In this photograph a hostile crowd in a slum surrounds him. And Joshua remains silent as they vented their rage against him. This image, to me, is almost like from a Shakespearean play, with a man, surrounded by various influences, desperate to hold on to something true within himself, in a context of great suffering that he has created himself.I was intensely moved during all this. But the question is, does forgiveness and redemption replace justice? Joshua, in his own words, says that he does not mind standing trial for his crimes, and speaks about them from soapboxes across Monrovia, to an audience that often includes his victims. A very unlikely spokesperson for the idea of separation of church and state.The second story I'm going to tell you about is about a group of very special fighting women with rather unique peace-keeping skills. Liberia has been devastated by one of Africa's bloodiest civil wars, which has left more than 200,000 people dead, thousands of women scarred by rape and crime on a spectacular scale. Liberia is now home to an all-woman United Nations contingent of Indian peacekeepers.These women, many from small towns in India, help keep the peace, far away from home and family. They use negotiation and tolerance more often than an armed response. The commander told me that a woman could gauge a potentially violent situation much better than men. And that they were definitely capable of diffusing it non-aggressively. This man was very drunk, and he was very interested in my camera, until he noticed the women, who handled him with smiles, and AK-47s at the ready, of course. (Laughter)This contingent seems to be quite lucky, and it has not sustained any casualties, even though dozens of peacekeepers have been killed in Liberia. And yes, all of those people killed were male. Many of the women are married with children, and they say the hardest part of their deployment was being kept away from their children.I accompanied these women on their patrols, and watched as they walked past men, many who passed very lewd comments incessantly. And when I asked one of the women about the shock and awe response, she said, \"Don't worry, same thing back home. We know how to deal with these fellows,\" and ignored them.In a country ravaged by violence against women, Indian peacekeepers have inspired many local women to join the police force. Sometimes, when the war is over and all the film crews have left, the most inspiring stories are the ones that float just beneath the radar. I came back to India and nobody was interested in buying the story. And one editor told me that she wasn't interested in doing what she called \"manual labor stories.\"In 2007 and 2009 I did stories on the Delhi Fire Service, the DFS, which, during the summer, is probably the world's most active fire department. They answer more than 5,000 calls in just two months. And all this against incredible logistical odds, like heat and traffic jams. Something amazing happened during this shoot. Due to a traffic jam, we were late in getting to a slum, a large slum, which had caught fire. As we neared, angry crowds attacked our trucks and stoned them, by hundreds of people all over the place. These men were terrified, as the mob attacked our vehicle.But nonetheless, despite the hostility, firefighters left the vehicle and successfully fought the fire. Running the gauntlet through hostile crowds, and some wearing motorbike helmets to prevent injury. Some of the local people forcibly took away the hoses from the firemen to put out the fire in their homes. Now, hundreds of homes were destroyed. But the question that lingered in my mind was, what causes people to destroy fire trucks headed to their own homes? Where does such rage come from? And how are we responsible for this? 45 percent of the 14 million people who live in Delhi live in unauthorized slums, which are chronically overcrowded. They lack even the most basic amenities. And this is something that is common to all our big cities.Back to the DFS. A huge chemical depot caught fire, thousands of drums filled with petrochemicals were blazing away and exploding all around us. The heat was so intense, that hoses were used to cool down firefighters fighting extremely close to the fire, and with no protective clothing. In India we often love to complain about our government bodies. But over here, the heads of the DFS, Mr. R.C. Sharman, Mr. A.K. Sharman, led the firefight with their men. Something wonderful in a country where manual labor is often looked down upon. (Applause)Over the years, my faith in the power of storytelling has been tested. And I've had very serious doubt about its efficacy, and my own faith in humanity. However, a film we shot still airs on the National Geographic channel. And when it airs I get calls from all the guys I was with and they tell me that they receive hundreds of calls congratulating them. Some of the firemen told me that they were also inspired to do better because they were so pleased to get thank-yous rather than brick bats.It seems that this story helped change perceptions about the DFS, at least in the minds of an audience in part on televisions, read magazines and whose huts aren't on fire. Sometimes, focusing on what's heroic, beautiful and dignified, regardless of the context, can help magnify these intangibles three ways, in the protagonist of the story, in the audience, and also in the storyteller. And that's the power of storytelling. Focus on what's dignified, courageous and beautiful, and it grows. Thank you.

involved in the documentary\n\n00:00:15.958 --> 00:00:19.958\nfilmmaking business all over the world for the last 10 years.\n\n00:00:19.958 --> 00:00:21.958\nDuring the process of making these films\n\n00:00:21.958 --> 00:00:24.958\nI found myself taking photographs,\n\n00:00:24.958 --> 00:00:27.958\noften much to the annoyance of the video cameramen.\n\n00:00:27.958 --> 00:00:30.958\nI found this photography of mine almost compulsive.\n\n00:00:30.958 --> 00:00:33.958\nAnd at the end of a shoot, I would sometimes feel that\n\n00:00:33.958 --> 00:00:36.958\nI had photographs that told a better story\n\n00:00:36.958 --> 00:00:40.958\nthan a sometimes-sensational documentary.\n\n00:00:40.958 --> 00:00:42.958\nI felt, when I had my photographs,\n\n00:00:42.958 --> 00:00:44.958\nthat I was holding on to something true,\n\n00:00:44.958 --> 00:00:47.958\nregardless of agendas or politics.\n\n00:00:47.958 --> 00:00:51.958\nIn 2007, I traveled to three war zones.\n\n00:00:51.958 --> 00:00:54.958\nI traveled to Iraq, Afghanistan and Liberia.\n\n00:00:54.958 --> 00:00:56.958\nAnd over there I experienced\n\n00:00:56.958 --> 00:00:59.958\nother people's suffering, up close and personal,\n\n00:00:59.958 --> 00:01:03.958\nimmersed myself in some rather intense and emotional stories,\n\n00:01:03.958 --> 00:01:08.958\nand at times I experienced great fear for my own life.\n\n00:01:08.958 --> 00:01:10.958\nAs always, I would return to Bangalore,\n\n00:01:10.958 --> 00:01:13.958\nand often to animated discussions at friend's homes,\n\n00:01:13.958 --> 00:01:15.958\nwhere we would discuss various issues\n\n00:01:15.958 --> 00:01:18.958\nwhile they complained bitterly about the new pub timings,\n\n00:01:18.958 --> 00:01:20.958\nwhere a drink often cost more than what they'd paid\n\n00:01:20.958 --> 00:01:22.958\ntheir 14-year-old maid.\n\n00:01:22.958 --> 00:01:26.958\nI would feel very isolated during these discussions.\n\n00:01:26.958 --> 00:01:29.958\nBut at the same time, I questioned myself\n\n00:01:29.958 --> 00:01:33.958\nand my own integrity and purpose in storytelling.\n\n00:01:33.958 --> 00:01:37.958\nAnd I decided that I had compromised,\n\n00:01:37.958 --> 00:01:40.958\njust like my friends in those discussions,\n\n00:01:40.958 --> 00:01:43.958\nwhere we told stories\n\n00:01:43.958 --> 00:01:46.958\nin contexts we made excuses for,\n\n00:01:46.958 --> 00:01:50.958\nrather than taking responsibility for.\n\n00:01:50.958 --> 00:01:57.958\nI won't go into details about what led to a decision I made,\n\n00:01:57.958 --> 00:01:59.958\nbut let's just say it involved alcohol, cigarettes,\n\n00:01:59.958 --> 00:02:02.958\nother substances and a woman.\n\n00:02:02.958 --> 00:02:03.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:02:03.958 --> 00:02:05.958\nI basically decided that it was I,\n\n00:02:05.958 --> 00:02:07.958\nnot the camera or the network,\n\n00:02:07.958 --> 00:02:10.958\nor anything that lay outside myself,\n\n00:02:10.958 --> 00:02:12.958\nthat was the only instrument in storytelling\n\n00:02:12.958 --> 00:02:15.958\ntruly worth tuning.\n\n00:02:15.958 --> 00:02:18.958\nIn my life, when I tried to achieve things\n\n00:02:18.958 --> 00:02:21.958\nlike success or recognition, they eluded me.\n\n00:02:21.958 --> 00:02:24.958\nParadoxically, when I let go of these objectives,\n\n00:02:24.958 --> 00:02:27.958\nand worked from a place of compassion and purpose,\n\n00:02:27.958 --> 00:02:31.958\nlooking for excellence, rather than the results of it,\n\n00:02:31.958 --> 00:02:36.958\neverything arrived on its own, including fulfillment.\n\n00:02:36.958 --> 00:02:39.958\nPhotography transcended culture, including my own.\n\n00:02:39.958 --> 00:02:43.958\nAnd it is, for me, a language which expressed the intangible,\n\n00:02:43.958 --> 00:02:45.958\nand gives voice to people and stories without.\n\n00:02:45.958 --> 00:02:47.958\nI invite you into three recent stories of mine,\n\n00:02:47.958 --> 00:02:50.958\nwhich are about this way of looking, if you will,\n\n00:02:50.958 --> 00:02:53.958\nwhich I believe exemplify the tenets\n\n00:02:53.958 --> 00:02:57.958\nof what I like to call compassion in storytelling.\n\n00:02:57.958 --> 00:03:02.958\nIn 2007 I went to Liberia,\n\n00:03:02.958 --> 00:03:06.958\nwhere a group of my friends and I\n\n00:03:06.958 --> 00:03:09.958\ndid an independent, self-funded film, still in progress,\n\n00:03:09.958 --> 00:03:13.958\non a very legendary and brutal war-lord\n\n00:03:13.958 --> 00:03:15.958\nnamed General Butt Naked.\n\n00:03:15.958 --> 00:03:18.958\nHis real name is Joshua, and he's pictured here in a cell\n\n00:03:18.958 --> 00:03:21.958\nwhere he once used to torture and murder people,\n\n00:03:21.958 --> 00:03:24.958\nincluding children.\n\n00:03:24.958 --> 00:03:26.958\nJoshua claims to have personally killed\n\n00:03:26.958 --> 00:03:30.958\nmore than 10,000 people during Liberia's civil war.\n\n00:03:30.958 --> 00:03:33.958\nHe got his name from fighting stark naked.\n\n00:03:33.958 --> 00:03:35.958\nAnd he is probably the most prolific mass murderer\n\n00:03:35.958 --> 00:03:38.958\nalive on Earth today.\n\n00:03:38.958 --> 00:03:43.958\nThis woman witnessed the General murdering her brother.\n\n00:03:43.958 --> 00:03:46.958\nJoshua commanded his child-soldiers to commit unspeakable crimes,\n\n00:03:46.958 --> 00:03:49.958\nand enforced his command with great brutality.\n\n00:03:49.958 --> 00:03:52.958\nToday many of these children are addicted to drugs like heroin,\n\n00:03:52.958 --> 00:03:57.958\nand they are destitute, like these young men in the image.\n\n00:03:57.958 --> 00:03:59.958\nHow do you live with yourself\n\n00:03:59.958 --> 00:04:04.958\nif you know you've committed horrific crimes?\n\n00:04:04.958 --> 00:04:08.958\nToday the General is a baptized Christian evangelist.\n\n00:04:08.958 --> 00:04:10.958\nAnd he's on a mission.\n\n00:04:10.958 --> 00:04:13.958\nWe accompanied Joshua, as he walked the Earth,\n\n00:04:13.958 --> 00:04:16.958\nvisiting villages where he had once killed and raped.\n\n00:04:16.958 --> 00:04:18.958\nHe seeked forgiveness,\n\n00:04:18.958 --> 00:04:20.958\nand he claims to endeavor to improve\n\n00:04:20.958 --> 00:04:22.958\nthe lives of his child-soldiers.\n\n00:04:22.958 --> 00:04:24.958\nDuring this expedition I expected him\n\n00:04:24.958 --> 00:04:26.958\nto be killed outright, and us as well.\n\n00:04:26.958 --> 00:04:28.958\nBut what I saw opened my eyes\n\n00:04:28.958 --> 00:04:30.958\nto an idea of forgiveness\n\n00:04:30.958 --> 00:04:33.958\nwhich I never thought possible.\n\n00:04:33.958 --> 00:04:36.958\nIn the midst of incredible poverty and loss,\n\n00:04:36.958 --> 00:04:38.958\npeople who had nothing absolved a man\n\n00:04:38.958 --> 00:04:42.958\nwho had taken everything from them.\n\n00:04:42.958 --> 00:04:44.958\nHe begs for forgiveness,\n\n00:04:44.958 --> 00:04:46.958\nand receives it from the same woman\n\n00:04:46.958 --> 00:04:49.958\nwhose brother he murdered.\n\n00:04:49.958 --> 00:04:51.958\nSenegalese, the young man seated on the wheelchair here,\n\n00:04:51.958 --> 00:04:54.958\nwas once a child soldier, under the General's command,\n\n00:04:54.958 --> 00:04:56.958\nuntil he disobeyed orders,\n\n00:04:56.958 --> 00:05:00.958\nand the General shot off both his legs.\n\n00:05:00.958 --> 00:05:03.958\nHe forgives the General in this image.\n\n00:05:03.958 --> 00:05:05.958\nHe risked his life as he walked up to people\n\n00:05:05.958 --> 00:05:08.958\nwhose families he'd murdered.\n\n00:05:08.958 --> 00:05:11.958\nIn this photograph a hostile crowd in a slum surrounds him.\n\n00:05:11.958 --> 00:05:14.958\nAnd Joshua remains silent\n\n00:05:14.958 --> 00:05:18.958\nas they vented their rage against him.\n\n00:05:18.958 --> 00:05:20.958\nThis image, to me, is almost like from a Shakespearean play,\n\n00:05:20.958 --> 00:05:23.958\nwith a man, surrounded by various influences,\n\n00:05:23.958 --> 00:05:27.958\ndesperate to hold on to something true within himself,\n\n00:05:27.958 --> 00:05:31.958\nin a context of great suffering that he has created himself.\n\n00:05:31.958 --> 00:05:33.958\nI was intensely moved during all this.\n\n00:05:33.958 --> 00:05:35.958\nBut the question is,\n\n00:05:35.958 --> 00:05:39.958\ndoes forgiveness and redemption replace justice?\n\n00:05:39.958 --> 00:05:41.958\nJoshua, in his own words, says that he does not mind\n\n00:05:41.958 --> 00:05:43.958\nstanding trial for his crimes,\n\n00:05:43.958 --> 00:05:45.958\nand speaks about them from soapboxes across Monrovia,\n\n00:05:45.958 --> 00:05:49.958\nto an audience that often includes his victims.\n\n00:05:49.958 --> 00:05:51.958\nA very unlikely spokesperson for the idea of\n\n00:05:51.958 --> 00:05:54.958\nseparation of church and state.\n\n00:05:54.958 --> 00:05:56.958\nThe second story I'm going to tell you about\n\n00:05:56.958 --> 00:05:58.958\nis about a group of very special fighting women\n\n00:05:58.958 --> 00:06:01.958\nwith rather unique peace-keeping skills.\n\n00:06:01.958 --> 00:06:03.958\nLiberia has been devastated by one of Africa's\n\n00:06:03.958 --> 00:06:05.958\nbloodiest civil wars,\n\n00:06:05.958 --> 00:06:07.958\nwhich has left more than 200,000 people dead,\n\n00:06:07.958 --> 00:06:09.958\nthousands of women scarred by rape and crime\n\n00:06:09.958 --> 00:06:12.958\non a spectacular scale.\n\n00:06:12.958 --> 00:06:14.958\nLiberia is now home\n\n00:06:14.958 --> 00:06:16.958\nto an all-woman United Nations contingent\n\n00:06:16.958 --> 00:06:19.958\nof Indian peacekeepers.\n\n00:06:19.958 --> 00:06:21.958\nThese women, many from small towns in India,\n\n00:06:21.958 --> 00:06:26.958\nhelp keep the peace, far away from home and family.\n\n00:06:26.958 --> 00:06:28.958\nThey use negotiation and tolerance\n\n00:06:28.958 --> 00:06:30.958\nmore often than an armed response.\n\n00:06:30.958 --> 00:06:32.958\nThe commander told me that a woman could gauge\n\n00:06:32.958 --> 00:06:34.958\na potentially violent situation\n\n00:06:34.958 --> 00:06:36.958\nmuch better than men.\n\n00:06:36.958 --> 00:06:40.958\nAnd that they were definitely capable of diffusing it non-aggressively.\n\n00:06:40.958 --> 00:06:42.958\nThis man was very drunk,\n\n00:06:42.958 --> 00:06:44.958\nand he was very interested in my camera,\n\n00:06:44.958 --> 00:06:46.958\nuntil he noticed the women, who handled him\n\n00:06:46.958 --> 00:06:49.958\nwith smiles, and AK-47s at the ready, of course.\n\n00:06:49.958 --> 00:06:50.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:06:50.958 --> 00:06:53.958\nThis contingent seems to be quite lucky,\n\n00:06:53.958 --> 00:06:55.958\nand it has not sustained any casualties,\n\n00:06:55.958 --> 00:06:58.958\neven though dozens of peacekeepers have been killed in Liberia.\n\n00:06:58.958 --> 00:07:02.958\nAnd yes, all of those people killed were male.\n\n00:07:02.958 --> 00:07:04.958\nMany of the women are married with children,\n\n00:07:04.958 --> 00:07:07.958\nand they say the hardest part of their deployment\n\n00:07:07.958 --> 00:07:10.958\nwas being kept away from their children.\n\n00:07:10.958 --> 00:07:12.958\nI accompanied these women on their patrols,\n\n00:07:12.958 --> 00:07:14.958\nand watched as they walked past men,\n\n00:07:14.958 --> 00:07:17.958\nmany who passed very lewd comments incessantly.\n\n00:07:17.958 --> 00:07:19.958\nAnd when I asked one of the women about the shock and awe response,\n\n00:07:19.958 --> 00:07:21.958\nshe said, \"Don't worry, same thing back home.\n\n00:07:21.958 --> 00:07:23.958\nWe know how to deal with these fellows,\"\n\n00:07:23.958 --> 00:07:26.958\nand ignored them.\n\n00:07:26.958 --> 00:07:28.958\nIn a country ravaged by violence against women,\n\n00:07:28.958 --> 00:07:31.958\nIndian peacekeepers have inspired many local women\n\n00:07:31.958 --> 00:07:33.958\nto join the police force.\n\n00:07:33.958 --> 00:07:36.958\nSometimes, when the war is over and all the film crews have left,\n\n00:07:36.958 --> 00:07:38.958\nthe most inspiring stories are the ones\n\n00:07:38.958 --> 00:07:41.958\nthat float just beneath the radar.\n\n00:07:41.958 --> 00:07:45.958\nI came back to India and nobody was interested in buying the story.\n\n00:07:45.958 --> 00:07:47.958\nAnd one editor told me that she wasn't interested\n\n00:07:47.958 --> 00:07:52.958\nin doing what she called \"manual labor stories.\"\n\n00:07:52.958 --> 00:07:57.958\nIn 2007 and 2009 I did stories on the Delhi Fire Service, the DFS,\n\n00:07:57.958 --> 00:08:00.958\nwhich, during the summer, is probably the world's most active fire department.\n\n00:08:00.958 --> 00:08:03.958\nThey answer more than 5,000 calls in just two months.\n\n00:08:03.958 --> 00:08:06.958\nAnd all this against incredible logistical odds,\n\n00:08:06.958 --> 00:08:09.958\nlike heat and traffic jams.\n\n00:08:09.958 --> 00:08:11.958\nSomething amazing happened during this shoot.\n\n00:08:11.958 --> 00:08:14.958\nDue to a traffic jam, we were late in getting to a slum,\n\n00:08:14.958 --> 00:08:17.958\na large slum, which had caught fire.\n\n00:08:17.958 --> 00:08:20.958\nAs we neared, angry crowds attacked our trucks\n\n00:08:20.958 --> 00:08:23.958\nand stoned them, by hundreds of people all over the place.\n\n00:08:23.958 --> 00:08:25.958\nThese men were terrified,\n\n00:08:25.958 --> 00:08:28.958\nas the mob attacked our vehicle.\n\n00:08:28.958 --> 00:08:30.958\nBut nonetheless, despite the hostility,\n\n00:08:30.958 --> 00:08:34.958\nfirefighters left the vehicle and successfully fought the fire.\n\n00:08:34.958 --> 00:08:36.958\nRunning the gauntlet through hostile crowds,\n\n00:08:36.958 --> 00:08:39.958\nand some wearing motorbike helmets to prevent injury.\n\n00:08:39.958 --> 00:08:42.958\nSome of the local people forcibly took away the hoses\n\n00:08:42.958 --> 00:08:45.958\nfrom the firemen to put out the fire in their homes.\n\n00:08:45.958 --> 00:08:47.958\nNow, hundreds of homes were destroyed.\n\n00:08:47.958 --> 00:08:51.958\nBut the question that lingered in my mind was,\n\n00:08:51.958 --> 00:08:54.958\nwhat causes people to destroy fire trucks\n\n00:08:54.958 --> 00:08:56.958\nheaded to their own homes?\n\n00:08:56.958 --> 00:08:59.958\nWhere does such rage come from?\n\n00:08:59.958 --> 00:09:03.958\nAnd how are we responsible for this?\n\n00:09:03.958 --> 00:09:06.958\n45 percent of the 14 million people\n\n00:09:06.958 --> 00:09:08.958\nwho live in Delhi live in unauthorized slums,\n\n00:09:08.958 --> 00:09:11.958\nwhich are chronically overcrowded.\n\n00:09:11.958 --> 00:09:13.958\nThey lack even the most basic amenities.\n\n00:09:13.958 --> 00:09:18.958\nAnd this is something that is common to all our big cities.\n\n00:09:18.958 --> 00:09:21.958\nBack to the DFS. A huge chemical depot caught fire,\n\n00:09:21.958 --> 00:09:24.958\nthousands of drums filled with petrochemicals\n\n00:09:24.958 --> 00:09:27.958\nwere blazing away and exploding all around us.\n\n00:09:27.958 --> 00:09:29.958\nThe heat was so intense, that hoses were used\n\n00:09:29.958 --> 00:09:31.958\nto cool down firefighters\n\n00:09:31.958 --> 00:09:35.958\nfighting extremely close to the fire, and with no protective clothing.\n\n00:09:35.958 --> 00:09:39.958\nIn India we often love to complain about our government bodies.\n\n00:09:39.958 --> 00:09:41.958\nBut over here, the heads of the DFS,\n\n00:09:41.958 --> 00:09:43.958\nMr. R.C. Sharman, Mr. A.K. Sharman,\n\n00:09:43.958 --> 00:09:46.958\nled the firefight with their men.\n\n00:09:46.958 --> 00:09:48.958\nSomething wonderful in a country where\n\n00:09:48.958 --> 00:09:51.958\nmanual labor is often looked down upon.\n\n00:09:51.958 --> 00:09:55.958\n(Applause)\n\n00:09:55.958 --> 00:09:59.958\nOver the years, my faith in the power of storytelling has been tested.\n\n00:09:59.958 --> 00:10:02.958\nAnd I've had very serious doubt about its efficacy,\n\n00:10:02.958 --> 00:10:04.958\nand my own faith in humanity.\n\n00:10:04.958 --> 00:10:08.958\nHowever, a film we shot still airs on the National Geographic channel.\n\n00:10:08.958 --> 00:10:12.958\nAnd when it airs I get calls from all the guys I was with\n\n00:10:12.958 --> 00:10:16.958\nand they tell me that they receive hundreds of calls congratulating them.\n\n00:10:16.958 --> 00:10:18.958\nSome of the firemen told me that they were also inspired\n\n00:10:18.958 --> 00:10:20.958\nto do better because they were so pleased\n\n00:10:20.958 --> 00:10:23.958\nto get thank-yous rather than brick bats.\n\n00:10:23.958 --> 00:10:27.958\nIt seems that this story helped change perceptions about the DFS,\n\n00:10:27.958 --> 00:10:30.958\nat least in the minds of an audience in part on televisions,\n\n00:10:30.958 --> 00:10:33.958\nread magazines and whose huts aren't on fire.\n\n00:10:33.958 --> 00:10:38.958\nSometimes, focusing on what's heroic, beautiful and dignified,\n\n00:10:38.958 --> 00:10:40.958\nregardless of the context,\n\n00:10:40.958 --> 00:10:44.958\ncan help magnify these intangibles three ways,\n\n00:10:44.958 --> 00:10:48.958\nin the protagonist of the story, in the audience,\n\n00:10:48.958 --> 00:10:50.958\nand also in the storyteller.\n\n00:10:50.958 --> 00:10:52.958\nAnd that's the power of storytelling.\n\n00:10:52.958 --> 00:10:54.958\nFocus on what's dignified, courageous and beautiful,\n\n00:10:54.958 --> 00:10:57.958\nand it grows.

In fact, they make their living on this stuff. I'm going to try to save you all the time and money and go through it in the next three minutes, so bear with me. Started a website in 2005 with a few friends, called Reddit.com. It's what you'd call a social news website;basically, the democratic front page of the best stuff on the web. You find some interesting content \u2014 say, a TED Talk \u2014 submit it to Reddit, and a community of your peers votes up if they like it, down if they don't. That creates the front page. It's always rising, falling; a half million people visit every day. But this isn't about Reddit. It's about discovering new things that pop up on the web. In the last four years, we've seen all kinds of memes, all kinds of trends get born right on our front page.This isn't about Reddit itself, it's actually about humpback whales. Well, technically, it's about Greenpeace, an environmental organization that wanted to stop the Japanese government's whaling campaign. The whales were getting killed; they wanted to put an end to it. One of the ways they wanted to do it was to put a tracking chip inside one of the whales. But to personify the movement, they wanted to name it.So in true web fashion, they put together a poll, where they had a bunch of very erudite, very thoughtful, cultured names. I believe this is the Farsi word for \"immortal.\" I think this means \"divine power of the ocean\" in a Polynesian language. And then there was this: \"Mister Splashy Pants.\"(Laughter)And this was a special name. Mister Pants, or \"Splashy\" to his friends, was very popular on the Internet. In fact, someone on Reddit thought, \"What a great thing, we should all vote this up.\" And Redditors responded and all agreed. So the voting started. We got behind it ourselves; we changed our logo for the day, from the alien to Splashy, to help the cause. And it wasn't long before other sites like Fark and Boing Boing and the rest of the Internet started saying, \"We love Splashy Pants!\"So it went from about five percent, which was when this meme started, to 70 percent at the end of voting. Pretty impressive, right? We won! Mister Splashy Pants was chosen. Just kidding \u2014 Greenpeace actually wasn't that crazy about it, because they wanted one of the more thoughtful names to win. They said, \"No, just kidding. We'll give it another week of voting.\"Well, that got us a little angry, so we changed it to Fightin' Splashy.(Laughter)And the Reddit community \u2014 really, the rest of the Internet, really got behind this. Facebook groups were created. Facebook applications were created. The idea was, \"Vote your conscience, vote for Mister Splashy Pants.\" People were putting up signs in the real world about this whale.(Laughter)This was the final vote: 78 percent of the votes. To give you an idea of the landslide, the next highest name pulled in three.There was a clear lesson: the Internet loves Mister Splashy Pants. Which is obvious. It's a great name. Everyone wants to hear their news anchor say, \"Mister Splashy Pants.\"(Laughter)I think that's what helped drive this. What was cool were the repercussions. Greenpeace created an entire marketing campaign around it \u2014 Mister Splashy Pants shirts and pins, an e-card so you could send your friend a dancing Splashy. But even more important was that they accomplished their mission. The Japanese government called off their whaling expedition. Mission accomplished: Greenpeace was thrilled, the whales were happy \u2014 that's a quote.(Laughter)And actually, Redditors in the Internet community were happy to participate, but they weren't whale lovers. A few, certainly, but we're talking about a lot of people, really interested and caught up in this meme. Greenpeace came back to the site and thanked Reddit for its participation. But this wasn't really altruism; just interest in doing something cool.This is how the Internet works. This is that great big secret. The Internet provides a level playing field. Your link is as good as your link, which is as good as my link. With a browser, anyone can get to any website no matter your budget. That is, as long as you can keep net neutrality in place.Another important thing is it costs nothing to get content online. There are so many publishing tools available, it only takes a few minutes to produce something. and the cost of iteration is so cheap, you might as well.If you do, be genuine. Be honest, up-front. One of the great lessons Greenpeace learned is that it's OK to lose control, OK to take yourself a little less seriously, given that, even though it's a very serious cause, you could ultimately achieve your goal. That's the final message I want to share: you can do well online. But no longer is the message coming from just the top down. If you want to succeed you've got to be OK to lose control.Thank you.(Applause)", "id": 714, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:13.274 --> 00:00:16.227\nThere are a lot of web 2.0 consultants\nwho make a lot of money.\n\n00:00:16.251 --> 00:00:18.425\nIn fact, they make\ntheir living on this stuff.\n\n00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:20.857\nI'm going to try to save you\nall the time and money\n\n00:00:20.881 --> 00:00:23.739\nand go through it in the next\nthree minutes, so bear with me.\n\n00:00:23.763 --> 00:00:26.933\nStarted a website in 2005\nwith a few friends, called Reddit.com.\n\n00:00:26.957 --> 00:00:28.993\nIt's what you'd call\na social news website;\n\n00:00:29.017 --> 00:00:32.271\nbasically, the democratic front page\nof the best stuff on the web.\n\n00:00:32.295 --> 00:00:36.157\nYou find some interesting content --\nsay, a TED Talk -- submit it to Reddit,\n\n00:00:36.181 --> 00:00:39.746\nand a community of your peers votes up\nif they like it, down if they don't.\n\n00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:41.107\nThat creates the front page.\n\n00:00:41.131 --> 00:00:44.288\nIt's always rising, falling;\na half million people visit every day.\n\n00:00:44.312 --> 00:00:45.649\nBut this isn't about Reddit.\n\n00:00:45.673 --> 00:00:48.374\nIt's about discovering new things\nthat pop up on the web.\n\n00:00:48.398 --> 00:00:50.942\nIn the last four years,\nwe've seen all kinds of memes,\n\n00:00:50.966 --> 00:00:53.591\nall kinds of trends get born\nright on our front page.\n\n00:00:53.615 --> 00:00:56.831\nThis isn't about Reddit itself,\nit's actually about humpback whales.\n\n00:00:56.855 --> 00:01:00.535\nWell, technically, it's about Greenpeace,\nan environmental organization\n\n00:01:00.559 --> 00:01:03.643\nthat wanted to stop the Japanese\ngovernment's whaling campaign.\n\n00:01:03.667 --> 00:01:06.736\nThe whales were getting killed;\nthey wanted to put an end to it.\n\n00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:08.513\nOne of the ways they wanted to do it\n\n00:01:08.537 --> 00:01:11.025\nwas to put a tracking chip\ninside one of the whales.\n\n00:01:11.049 --> 00:01:13.667\nBut to personify the movement,\nthey wanted to name it.\n\n00:01:13.691 --> 00:01:16.010\nSo in true web fashion,\nthey put together a poll,\n\n00:01:16.034 --> 00:01:19.458\nwhere they had a bunch of very erudite,\nvery thoughtful, cultured names.\n\n00:01:19.482 --> 00:01:21.736\nI believe this is the Farsi word\nfor \"immortal.\"\n\n00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:25.794\nI think this means \"divine power\nof the ocean\" in a Polynesian language.\n\n00:01:25.818 --> 00:01:28.648\nAnd then there was this:\n\"Mister Splashy Pants.\"\n\n00:01:28.672 --> 00:01:29.906\n(Laughter)\n\n00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:31.295\nAnd this was a special name.\n\n00:01:31.319 --> 00:01:34.992\nMister Pants, or \"Splashy\" to his friends,\nwas very popular on the Internet.\n\n00:01:35.016 --> 00:01:36.764\nIn fact, someone on Reddit thought,\n\n00:01:36.788 --> 00:01:39.102\n\"What a great thing,\nwe should all vote this up.\"\n\n00:01:39.126 --> 00:01:41.529\nAnd Redditors responded and all agreed.\n\n00:01:41.553 --> 00:01:42.842\nSo the voting started.\n\n00:01:42.866 --> 00:01:45.736\nWe got behind it ourselves;\nwe changed our logo for the day,\n\n00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:48.330\nfrom the alien to Splashy,\nto help the cause.\n\n00:01:48.354 --> 00:01:51.346\nAnd it wasn't long before other sites\nlike Fark and Boing Boing\n\n00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:54.647\nand the rest of the Internet started\nsaying, \"We love Splashy Pants!\"\n\n00:01:54.671 --> 00:01:58.316\nSo it went from about five percent,\nwhich was when this meme started,\n\n00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:00.934\nto 70 percent at the end of voting.\n\n00:02:00.958 --> 00:02:04.344\nPretty impressive, right?\nWe won!

So, that's home really. The Maldives, as I'm sure you're aware, are a chain of islands off the southwest coast of India here. Capital, Mal\u00e9, where I live. Actually, sitting here today in Mysore, we're closer to Mal\u00e9 than we are to Delhi, for example.If you're in IT, India, obviously, is the place to be at the moment. But if you're a marine biologist, Maldives is not such a bad place to be. And it has been my home these years. For those of you who've been there, fantastic coral reefs, fantastic diving, fantastic snorkeling. I spend as much of my time as possible investigating the marine life. I study fish, also the bigger things, whales and dolphins.This is a blue whale. We have blue whales in the waters around here, off Maldives, around the waters of India. You can see them off Kerala. And, in fact, we're very lucky in this region. One of the best places in the world to see blue whales is here in this region. In Sri Lanka, if you go down to the south coast of Sri Lanka, during the northeast monsoon season, you can see blue whales very, very easily. It's probably the best place in the world to see them.Now, when I talk about the northeast monsoon season, I'm sure many of you here know exactly what I mean, but perhaps some of you are not quite so sure. I need to explain a little bit about monsoons. Now, monsoon, the root of the word \"monsoon\" comes from the word \"season.\"So, it's just a season. And there are two seasons in most of South Asia. And in the summer India heats up, gets very hot. Hot air rises, and air is drawn in off the sea to replace it. And the way it works is, it comes from the southwest. It comes off the ocean here and is drawn up towards India. So it comes from the southwest. It's a southwest monsoon. Picks up moisture as it crosses the ocean. That's what brings the monsoon rain. And then in the winter things cool down. High pressure builds over India. And the whole system goes into reverse.So, the wind is now coming from the northeast out of India, across the Indian Ocean, this way towards Africa. Keep that in mind. Now, I'm a marine biologist, but I'm actually a bit of an old fashioned naturalist, I suppose. I'm interested in all sorts of things, almost everything that moves, including dragonflies. And I'm actually going to talk, this afternoon, about dragonflies. This is a very beautiful species, it's called the Oriental Scarlet.And one thing you need to know about dragonflies, one important thing, is that they lay their eggs in fresh water. They need fresh water to breed. They lay the eggs into fresh water. Little larvae hatch out in fresh water. They feed on other little things. They feed on mosquito larvae. So, they're very important. They control mosquito larvae, among other things. And they grow and grow by stages. And they climb out of the water, burst out, as the adult which we see. And typically, there is a lot of variation, but if you have a dragonfly with, say, a one year life cycle, which is quite typical, the larva, living in the fresh water, lives for 10 or 11 months. And then the adult, which comes after, lives for one or two months. So it's essentially a freshwater animal. It really does need fresh water.Now, the particular species of dragonfly I want to talk about is this one, because most dragonflies, like the one we've just seen, when the adult is there for its brief one or two months of life, it doesn't go very far. It can't travel very far. A few kilometers, maybe, is quite typical. They are very good fliers, but they don't go too far. But this guy is an exception. And this is called the Globe Skimmer, or Wandering Glider. And, as the name might suggest, it is found pretty much around the world. It lives throughout the tropics, the Americas, Africa, Asia, Australia, into the Pacific. And it wanders far and wide. We know that much about it. But it really hasn't been studied very much.It's a rather mediocre looking dragonfly. If you're going to study dragonflies, you want to study those really bright beautiful ones, like that red one. Or the really rare ones, the endemic endangered ones. This is, it seems a bit dull you know. It's sort of dull-colored. And it's fairly common. And it occurs everywhere \u2014 you know, why bother? But if you take that attitude, you're actually missing something rather special. Because this dragonfly has a rather amazing story to tell. And I feel very privileged to have stumbled across it living in the Maldives.When I first went to the Maldives, dead keen on diving, spent as much of my time as I could in and under the water. Didn't notice any dragonflies; maybe they were there, maybe they weren't. Didn't notice them. But after some time, after some months, one day as I was going out and about, suddenly I noticed hundreds of dragonflies, hundreds of dragonflies. Something like this, these are all this species Globe Skimmer. I didn't know at the time, but I know now, they're Globe Skimmers, hundreds of them. And they were there for some time. And then they were gone.And I didn't think anything more of it until the following year, when it happened again, and then the year after that, and then the year after that. And I was a bit slow, I didn't really take too much notice. But I asked some Maldivian friends and colleagues, and yes they come every year. And I asked people about them and yes, they knew, but they didn't know anything, where they came from, or anything. And again I didn't think too much of it. But slowly it began to dawn on me that something rather special was happening.Because dragonflies need fresh water to breed. And the Maldives, and I'm sure some of you have been there \u2014 so here is home. So, Maldives, beautiful place. (Laughter) It's built entirely of coral reefs. And on top of the coral reefs are sand banks. Average height, about that much above sea level. So, global warming, sea level rise, it's a real serious issue. But I'm not going to talk about that. Another important point of these sand banks is that when it rains, the rainwater soaks down into the soil. So, it's gone. So, it stays under the soil. The trees can put their roots into it. Humans can dig holes and make a well.But dragonflies \u2014 a bit tricky. There is no surface fresh water. There are no ponds, streams, rivers, lakes, nothing like that. So, why is it that every year millions of dragonflies, millions, millions of dragonflies turn up? I got a little bit curious. In fact I'll stop here, because I want to ask, and there is a lot of people who, from India of course, people who grew up spending your childhood here. Those of you who are Indian or spent your childhood here, let me have a show of hands, who of you \u2014 not yet, not yet! You're too keen. You're too keen. No. Hang on. Hang on. Wait for the go. I'll say go.Those of you who grew up in India, do you remember in your childhood, dragonflies, swarms of dragonflies? Maybe at school, maybe tying little bits of string onto them? Maybe pulling bits off? I'm not asking about that. You've only got to say, do you remember seeing lots of dragonflies. Any hands? Any hands? Yes. Thank you. Thank you. It's a widespread phenomenon throughout South Asia, including the Maldives. And I got a bit curious about it.In the Maldives \u2014 now, in India there is plenty of water, so, dragonflies, yeah, of course. Why not? But in Maldives, no fresh water. So, what on Earth is going on? And the first thing I did was started recording when they turned up in the Maldives. And there is the answer, 21st of October. Not every year, that's the average date. So, I've been writing it down for 15 years now. You'd think they're coming from India. It's the closest place. But in October, remember, we're still in southwest monsoon, Maldives is still in the southwest monsoon. But wind is, invariably, every time, is from the west. It's going towards India, not from India. So, are these things, how are these things getting here? Are they coming from India against the wind? Seemed a bit unlikely.So, next thing I did is I got on the phone. Maldives is a long archipelago. It stretches about 500 miles, of course it's India here. I got on the phone and emailed to friends and colleagues. When do you see the dragonflies appear? And pretty soon, a picture started emerging. In Bangalore, a colleague there sent me information for three years, average, 24th of September, so late September. Down in Trivandrum, a bit later. Far north of Maldives, a bit later. Then Mal\u00e9, then further south. And then the southernmost Maldives. It's pretty obvious, they're coming from India. But they are coming 400 miles across the ocean, against the wind. How on Earth are they doing that? I didn't know.The next thing I did was I started counting dragonflies. I wanted to know about their seasonality, what time of year, this is when they first arrive, but how long are they around for? Does that give any clues? So, I started a very rigorous scientific process. I had a rigorous scientific transect. I got on my bicycle, and I cycled around the island of Mal\u00e9. It's about five kilometers around, counting the dragonflies as I go, trying not to bump into people as I'm looking in the trees.And they're here for a very short time, October, November, December. That's it. And then they tail off, there's a few, but that's it. October, November, December. That is not the northeast monsoon season. That's not the southwest season. That's the inter-monsoon, the time when the monsoon changes.Now, what I said was, you get the southwest monsoon going one way, and then it changes and you get the northeast monsoon going the other way. And that sort of gives the impression you've got one air mass going up and down, up and down. It doesn't work like that. What happens, actually, is there is two air masses. And there is a front between them, and the front moves. So, if you've got India here, when the front is up above India you're into the southwest monsoon. Then the front moves into the northeast monsoon. And that front in the middle is not vertical, it's at an angle.So, as it comes over towards Mal\u00e9 I'm standing in Mal\u00e9 underneath the front. I can be in the southwest monsoon. But the wind above is from the northeast monsoon. So, the dragonflies are actually coming from India on the northeast monsoon, but at an altitude at 1,000 to 2,000 meters up in the air. Incredible. These little insects, it's the same ones we see out here [in India], two inches long, five centimeters long, flying in their millions, 400 miles across the ocean, at 2,000 meters up. Quite incredible.So, I was quite pleased with myself. I thought wow, I've tracked this one, I know how they come here. Then I scratched my head a bit, and that's okay, I know how they come here, but why do they come here? What are millions of dragonflies doing, flying out over the ocean every year to their apparent doom? It doesn't make sense. There is nothing for them in Maldives. What on Earth are they doing? Well, to cut a long story short, they're actually flying right across the ocean. They're making it all the way across to East Africa.I know that because I have friends who work on fisheries' research vessels who have sent to me reports from boats out in the ocean. I know because we have reports from Seychelles, which fit in as well, down here. And I know because when you look at the rainfall, these particular insects, these Globe Skimmers breed in temporary rain water pools. Okay, they lay their eggs where the seasonal rains are, the monsoon rains. The larvae have to develop very quickly. They only take six weeks. Instead of 11 months, they're six weeks. They're up, and they're off.Now, here we have, in case you can't read at the back, the top is rainfall for India. And we're starting in June. So this is the monsoon rain. By September, October, it's drying out. Nothing for these dragonflies. There is no more seasonal rain. They've got to go hunting for seasonal rain. And they fly south. As the monsoon withdraws to the south they come down through Karnataka, into Kerala. And then they run out of land. But they are incredibly good fliers. This particular species, it can fly for thousands of kilometers. And it just keeps going. And the wind, the northeast wind swooshes it around and carries it off across the ocean to Africa, where it's raining. And they are breeding in the rains of Africa. Now, this is southeast Africa. It makes it look like there are sort of two breeding periods here. It's slightly more complicated than that.What's happening is they are breeding in the monsoon rains here. And the dragonflies you can see today outside here, on the campus, are the young of this generation. They hatched out in India. They're looking for somewhere to breed. If it rains here they'll breed. But most of them are going to carry on. And next stop, perhaps only four or five days away is going to be East Africa. The wind will swoosh them out across here. If they pass the Maldives they might go and have a look, nothing there, they'll carry on.Here, here, Kenya, East Africa, they've actually just come out of a long drought. Just last week the rains broke. The short rains broke and it's raining there now. And the dragonflies are there. I have reports from my various contacts. The dragonflies are here now. They're breeding there. When those guys, they'll lay their eggs now. They'll hatch out in six weeks. By that time the seasonal rains have moved on. It's not there, it's down here. They'll fly down here. And the clever thing is the wind is always converging to where the rain is. The rain occurs, these are summer rains. This is a summer monsoon. The sun is overhead there. Summer rains in southern Africa. The sun is overhead, maximum heating, maximum evaporation, maximum clouds, maximum rainfall, maximum opportunities for reproduction.Not only that, because you have this convection, you have this rising of the air where it's hot, air is drawn in. There's a convergence. So, wherever the rain is falling, the air is drawn towards it to replace the air that's rising. So, the little fellow that hatches out here, he gets up into the air, he is automatically carried to where the rain is falling. Lay their eggs, next generation, they come up, automatically carried to where the rain is falling. It's now back there. They come out, it's time to come back. So, in four generations, one, two, three, four and then back.A complete circuit of the Indian Ocean. This is a circuit of about 16,000 kilometers. 16,000 kilometers, four generations, mind you, for a two inch long insect. It's quite incredible. Those of you from North America will be familiar with the Monarch butterfly. Which, up until now has had the longest known insect migration. It's only half the length of this one. And this crossing here, of the ocean, is the only truly regular transoceanic crossing of any insect. A quite incredible feat. And I only stumbled on this because I was living in Mal\u00e9, in Maldives for long enough for it to percolate into my brain that something rather special was going on.But dragonflies are not the only creatures that make the crossing. There is more to the story. I'm also interested in birds. And I'm familiar with this fellow. This is a rather special bird. It's a falcon. It's called the eastern red-footed falcon, obviously. But it's also called the Amur Falcon. And it's called the Amur Falcon because it breeds in Amurland. Which is an area along the Amur River, which is up here. It's the border, much of it is the border between China and Russia, up here in the far east.So, Siberia, Manchuria. And that's where it breeds. And if you're a falcon it's quite a nice place to be in the summer. But it's a pretty miserable place to be in the winter. It's, well, you can imagine. So, as any sensible bird would do, he moves south. They move south. The whole population moves south. But then the being sensible stopped. So, now they don't stop here, or even down here. No, they turn across here. They have a little refueling stop in northeastern India. They come to the latitude of about Mumbai or Goa. And then they strike out across the ocean, down to Kenya. And down here, and they winter down here [in southern Africa]. Incredible. This is the most extraordinary migration of any bird of prey. A quite incredible migration.And they are not the only one that makes the crossing. They have the most incredible journey, but several make the crossing from India to Africa. Includes this one, the hobby. This fellow is a very nice bird, this is the Pied cuckoo. Those of you from northern India will be familiar with this. It comes with the monsoons. This time of year they cross back to Africa. And this guy, the roller, a rather beautiful bird. It's known as the Eurasian Roller. In India it occurs in the northwest, so it's known as the Kashmir Roller. And these birds, what I've done is I've complied all the records, all the available records of these birds, put them together, and found out they migrate at exactly the same time as the dragonflies. They make use of exactly the same winds. They travel at exactly the same time with the same winds to make the crossing. I know they travel at the same altitude.It's known about the Amur Falcon. This guy, unfortunately, one of these met an unfortunate end. He was flying off the coast of Goa, 21 years ago, 1988. October, 1988. An Indian Navy jet was flying off Goa, bang! In the middle of the night. Fortunately, a two engine jet got back to base, and they pulled the remains of one of these [Eurasian Rollers] out. Flying at night over the Indian Ocean 2,424 meters. Same height as the dragonflies go. So, they are using the same winds. And the other thing, the other important factor for all these birds, all medium sized fellows, and this includes the next slide as well, which is a bee-eater. Bee-eaters eat bees. This one has a nice blue cheek. It's a Blue-cheeked Bee-eater. And every one of these birds that makes the crossing from India to East Africa eats insects, large insects, the size of dragonflies. Thank you very much.

We have blue whales\n\n00:00:55.958 --> 00:00:58.958\nin the waters around here, off Maldives,\n\n00:00:58.958 --> 00:01:00.958\naround the waters of India. You can see them off Kerala.\n\n00:01:00.958 --> 00:01:02.958\nAnd, in fact, we're very lucky in this region.\n\n00:01:02.958 --> 00:01:04.958\nOne of the best places in the world to see blue whales\n\n00:01:04.958 --> 00:01:06.958\nis here in this region.\n\n00:01:06.958 --> 00:01:09.958\nIn Sri Lanka, if you go down to the south coast of Sri Lanka,\n\n00:01:09.958 --> 00:01:11.958\nduring the northeast monsoon season,\n\n00:01:11.958 --> 00:01:13.958\nyou can see blue whales very, very easily.\n\n00:01:13.958 --> 00:01:15.958\nIt's probably the best place in the world to see them.\n\n00:01:15.958 --> 00:01:18.958\nNow, when I talk about the northeast monsoon season,\n\n00:01:18.958 --> 00:01:20.958\nI'm sure many of you here know exactly what I mean,\n\n00:01:20.958 --> 00:01:23.958\nbut perhaps some of you are not quite so sure.\n\n00:01:23.958 --> 00:01:25.958\nI need to explain a little bit about monsoons.\n\n00:01:25.958 --> 00:01:27.958\nNow, monsoon, the root of the word \"monsoon\"\n\n00:01:27.958 --> 00:01:29.958\ncomes from the word \"season.\"\n\n00:01:29.958 --> 00:01:34.958\nSo, it's just a season. And there are two seasons in most of South Asia.\n\n00:01:34.958 --> 00:01:36.958\nAnd in the summer India heats up, gets very hot.\n\n00:01:36.958 --> 00:01:41.958\nHot air rises, and air is drawn in off the sea to replace it.\n\n00:01:41.958 --> 00:01:43.958\nAnd the way it works is, it comes from the southwest.\n\n00:01:43.958 --> 00:01:46.958\nIt comes off the ocean here and is drawn up towards India.\n\n00:01:46.958 --> 00:01:49.958\nSo it comes from the southwest. It's a southwest monsoon.\n\n00:01:49.958 --> 00:01:51.958\nPicks up moisture as it crosses the ocean.\n\n00:01:51.958 --> 00:01:53.958\nThat's what brings the monsoon rain.\n\n00:01:53.958 --> 00:01:55.958\nAnd then in the winter things cool down.\n\n00:01:55.958 --> 00:01:57.958\nHigh pressure builds over India.\n\n00:01:57.958 --> 00:02:00.958\nAnd the whole system goes into reverse.\n\n00:02:00.958 --> 00:02:02.958\nSo, the wind is now coming from the northeast\n\n00:02:02.958 --> 00:02:04.958\nout of India, across the Indian Ocean,\n\n00:02:04.958 --> 00:02:07.958\nthis way towards Africa.\n\n00:02:07.958 --> 00:02:09.958\nKeep that in mind.\n\n00:02:09.958 --> 00:02:11.958\nNow, I'm a marine biologist, but I'm actually\n\n00:02:11.958 --> 00:02:13.958\na bit of an old fashioned naturalist, I suppose.\n\n00:02:13.958 --> 00:02:15.958\nI'm interested in all sorts of things, almost everything that moves,\n\n00:02:15.958 --> 00:02:17.958\nincluding dragonflies. And I'm actually\n\n00:02:17.958 --> 00:02:19.958\ngoing to talk, this afternoon, about dragonflies.\n\n00:02:19.958 --> 00:02:22.958\nThis is a very beautiful species, it's called the Oriental Scarlet.\n\n00:02:22.958 --> 00:02:24.958\nAnd one thing you need to know about dragonflies,\n\n00:02:24.958 --> 00:02:26.958\none important thing,\n\n00:02:26.958 --> 00:02:28.958\nis that they lay their eggs in fresh water.\n\n00:02:28.958 --> 00:02:30.958\nThey need fresh water to breed.\n\n00:02:30.958 --> 00:02:32.958\nThey lay the eggs into fresh water.\n\n00:02:32.958 --> 00:02:34.958\nLittle larvae hatch out in fresh water.\n\n00:02:34.958 --> 00:02:37.958\nThey feed on other little things. They feed on mosquito larvae.\n\n00:02:37.958 --> 00:02:39.958\nSo, they're very important.\n\n00:02:39.958 --> 00:02:41.958\nThey control mosquito larvae, among other things.\n\n00:02:41.958 --> 00:02:44.958\nAnd they grow and grow by stages. And they climb out\n\n00:02:44.958 --> 00:02:46.958\nof the water, burst out, as the adult which we see.\n\n00:02:46.958 --> 00:02:48.958\nAnd typically, there is a lot of variation,\n\n00:02:48.958 --> 00:02:51.958\nbut if you have a dragonfly with, say, a one year life cycle,\n\n00:02:51.958 --> 00:02:54.958\nwhich is quite typical, the larva, living in the fresh water,\n\n00:02:54.958 --> 00:02:57.958\nlives for 10 or 11 months.\n\n00:02:57.958 --> 00:03:00.958\nAnd then the adult, which comes after, lives for one or two months.\n\n00:03:00.958 --> 00:03:02.958\nSo it's essentially a freshwater animal.\n\n00:03:02.958 --> 00:03:05.958\nIt really does need fresh water.\n\n00:03:05.958 --> 00:03:07.958\nNow, the particular species of dragonfly\n\n00:03:07.958 --> 00:03:09.958\nI want to talk about is this one,\n\n00:03:09.958 --> 00:03:12.958\nbecause most dragonflies, like the one we've just seen,\n\n00:03:12.958 --> 00:03:14.958\nwhen the adult is there for its brief one or two months of life,\n\n00:03:14.958 --> 00:03:17.958\nit doesn't go very far. It can't travel very far.\n\n00:03:17.958 --> 00:03:19.958\nA few kilometers, maybe, is quite typical.\n\n00:03:19.958 --> 00:03:22.958\nThey are very good fliers, but they don't go too far.\n\n00:03:22.958 --> 00:03:24.958\nBut this guy is an exception.\n\n00:03:24.958 --> 00:03:26.958\nAnd this is called the Globe Skimmer,\n\n00:03:26.958 --> 00:03:28.958\nor Wandering Glider.\n\n00:03:28.958 --> 00:03:31.958\nAnd, as the name might suggest, it is found pretty much around the world.\n\n00:03:31.958 --> 00:03:33.958\nIt lives throughout the tropics, the Americas,\n\n00:03:33.958 --> 00:03:36.958\nAfrica, Asia, Australia, into the Pacific.\n\n00:03:36.958 --> 00:03:39.958\nAnd it wanders far and wide. We know that much about it.\n\n00:03:39.958 --> 00:03:41.958\nBut it really hasn't been studied very much.\n\n00:03:41.958 --> 00:03:45.958\nIt's a rather mediocre looking dragonfly.\n\n00:03:45.958 --> 00:03:48.958\nIf you're going to study dragonflies, you want to study those really bright beautiful ones,\n\n00:03:48.958 --> 00:03:51.958\nlike that red one. Or the really rare ones, the endemic endangered ones.\n\n00:03:51.958 --> 00:03:54.958\nThis is, it seems a bit dull you know.\n\n00:03:54.958 --> 00:03:57.958\nIt's sort of dull-colored. And it's fairly common.\n\n00:03:57.958 --> 00:04:00.958\nAnd it occurs everywhere -- you know, why bother?\n\n00:04:00.958 --> 00:04:03.958\nBut if you take that attitude, you're actually missing something rather special.\n\n00:04:03.958 --> 00:04:06.958\nBecause this dragonfly has a rather amazing story to tell.\n\n00:04:06.958 --> 00:04:09.958\nAnd I feel very privileged to have stumbled across it\n\n00:04:09.958 --> 00:04:11.958\nliving in the Maldives.\n\n00:04:11.958 --> 00:04:13.958\nWhen I first went to the Maldives,\n\n00:04:13.958 --> 00:04:16.958\ndead keen on diving, spent as much of my time\n\n00:04:16.958 --> 00:04:18.958\nas I could in and under the water.\n\n00:04:18.958 --> 00:04:20.958\nDidn't notice any dragonflies; maybe they were there, maybe they weren't.\n\n00:04:20.958 --> 00:04:22.958\nDidn't notice them.\n\n00:04:22.958 --> 00:04:24.958\nBut after some time, after some months, one day\n\n00:04:24.958 --> 00:04:26.958\nas I was going out and about,\n\n00:04:26.958 --> 00:04:30.958\nsuddenly I noticed hundreds of dragonflies, hundreds of dragonflies.\n\n00:04:30.958 --> 00:04:33.958\nSomething like this, these are all this species Globe Skimmer.\n\n00:04:33.958 --> 00:04:35.958\nI didn't know at the time, but I know now,\n\n00:04:35.958 --> 00:04:37.958\nthey're Globe Skimmers, hundreds of them.\n\n00:04:37.958 --> 00:04:39.958\nAnd they were there for some time. And then they were gone.\n\n00:04:39.958 --> 00:04:41.958\nAnd I didn't think anything more of it until\n\n00:04:41.958 --> 00:04:43.958\nthe following year, when it happened again,\n\n00:04:43.958 --> 00:04:46.958\nand then the year after that, and then the year after that.\n\n00:04:46.958 --> 00:04:49.958\nAnd I was a bit slow, I didn't really take too much notice.\n\n00:04:49.958 --> 00:04:51.958\nBut I asked some Maldivian friends and colleagues, and yes they come every year.\n\n00:04:51.958 --> 00:04:53.958\nAnd I asked people about them and yes,\n\n00:04:53.958 --> 00:04:55.958\nthey knew, but they didn't know anything,\n\n00:04:55.958 --> 00:04:57.958\nwhere they came from, or anything.\n\n00:04:57.958 --> 00:05:00.958\nAnd again I didn't think too much of it.\n\n00:05:00.958 --> 00:05:02.958\nBut slowly it began to dawn on me that something\n\n00:05:02.958 --> 00:05:04.958\nrather special was happening.\n\n00:05:04.958 --> 00:05:07.958\nBecause dragonflies need fresh water to breed.\n\n00:05:07.958 --> 00:05:10.958\nAnd the Maldives, and I'm sure some of you have been there --\n\n00:05:10.958 --> 00:05:12.958\nso here is home.\n\n00:05:12.958 --> 00:05:14.958\nSo, Maldives, beautiful place.\n\n00:05:14.958 --> 00:05:16.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:05:16.958 --> 00:05:18.958\nIt's built entirely of coral reefs.\n\n00:05:18.958 --> 00:05:20.958\nAnd on top of the coral reefs are sand banks.\n\n00:05:20.958 --> 00:05:23.958\nAverage height, about that much above sea level.\n\n00:05:23.958 --> 00:05:26.958\nSo, global warming, sea level rise, it's a real serious issue.\n\n00:05:26.958 --> 00:05:28.958\nBut I'm not going to talk about that.\n\n00:05:28.958 --> 00:05:30.958\nAnother important point of these sand banks\n\n00:05:30.958 --> 00:05:32.958\nis that when it rains,\n\n00:05:32.958 --> 00:05:34.958\nthe rainwater soaks down into the soil. So, it's gone.\n\n00:05:34.958 --> 00:05:36.958\nSo, it stays under the soil.\n\n00:05:36.958 --> 00:05:38.958\nThe trees can put their roots into it.\n\n00:05:38.958 --> 00:05:40.958\nHumans can dig holes and make a well.\n\n00:05:40.958 --> 00:05:43.958\nBut dragonflies -- a bit tricky.\n\n00:05:43.958 --> 00:05:45.958\nThere is no surface fresh water.\n\n00:05:45.958 --> 00:05:47.958\nThere are no ponds, streams, rivers, lakes,\n\n00:05:47.958 --> 00:05:49.958\nnothing like that.\n\n00:05:49.958 --> 00:05:51.958\nSo, why is it that every year\n\n00:05:51.958 --> 00:05:53.958\nmillions of dragonflies, millions,\n\n00:05:53.958 --> 00:05:55.958\nmillions of dragonflies turn up?\n\n00:05:55.958 --> 00:05:57.958\nI got a little bit curious. In fact I'll stop here,\n\n00:05:57.958 --> 00:06:00.958\nbecause I want to ask, and there is a lot of people who,\n\n00:06:00.958 --> 00:06:03.958\nfrom India of course, people who grew up spending your childhood here.\n\n00:06:03.958 --> 00:06:07.958\nThose of you who are Indian or spent your childhood here,\n\n00:06:07.958 --> 00:06:09.958\nlet me have a show of hands, who of you --\n\n00:06:09.958 --> 00:06:11.958\nnot yet, not yet!\n\n00:06:11.958 --> 00:06:13.958\nYou're too keen. You're too keen. No. Hang on. Hang on.\n\n00:06:13.958 --> 00:06:17.958\nWait for the go. I'll say go.\n\n00:06:17.958 --> 00:06:20.958\nThose of you who grew up in India,\n\n00:06:20.958 --> 00:06:22.958\ndo you remember in your childhood, dragonflies,\n\n00:06:22.958 --> 00:06:24.958\nswarms of dragonflies? Maybe at school,\n\n00:06:24.958 --> 00:06:26.958\nmaybe tying little bits of string onto them?\n\n00:06:26.958 --> 00:06:28.958\nMaybe pulling bits off? I'm not asking about that.\n\n00:06:28.958 --> 00:06:32.958\nYou've only got to say, do you remember seeing lots of dragonflies.\n\n00:06:32.958 --> 00:06:35.958\nAny hands? Any hands? Yes. Thank you. Thank you.\n\n00:06:35.958 --> 00:06:37.958\nIt's a widespread phenomenon\n\n00:06:37.958 --> 00:06:41.958\nthroughout South Asia, including the Maldives.\n\n00:06:41.958 --> 00:06:43.958\nAnd I got a bit curious about it.\n\n00:06:43.958 --> 00:06:45.958\nIn the Maldives -- now, in India there is plenty of water,\n\n00:06:45.958 --> 00:06:47.958\nso, dragonflies, yeah, of course. Why not?\n\n00:06:47.958 --> 00:06:50.958\nBut in Maldives, no fresh water. So, what on Earth is going on?\n\n00:06:50.958 --> 00:06:53.958\nAnd the first thing I did was started recording\n\n00:06:53.958 --> 00:06:55.958\nwhen they turned up in the Maldives.\n\n00:06:55.958 --> 00:06:57.958\nAnd there is the answer, 21st of October.\n\n00:06:57.958 --> 00:06:59.958\nNot every year, that's the average date.\n\n00:06:59.958 --> 00:07:01.958\nSo, I've been writing it down for 15 years now.\n\n00:07:01.958 --> 00:07:03.958\nYou'd think they're coming from India. It's the closest place.\n\n00:07:03.958 --> 00:07:06.958\nBut in October, remember, we're still in southwest monsoon,\n\n00:07:06.958 --> 00:07:08.958\nMaldives is still in the southwest monsoon.\n\n00:07:08.958 --> 00:07:11.958\nBut wind is, invariably, every time, is from the west.\n\n00:07:11.958 --> 00:07:13.958\nIt's going towards India, not from India.\n\n00:07:13.958 --> 00:07:15.958\nSo, are these things, how are these things getting here?\n\n00:07:15.958 --> 00:07:17.958\nAre they coming from India against the wind?\n\n00:07:17.958 --> 00:07:19.958\nSeemed a bit unlikely.\n\n00:07:19.958 --> 00:07:21.958\nSo, next thing I did is I got on the phone.\n\n00:07:21.958 --> 00:07:23.958\nMaldives is a long archipelago.\n\n00:07:23.958 --> 00:07:25.958\nIt stretches about 500 miles, of course it's India here.\n\n00:07:25.958 --> 00:07:27.958\nI got on the phone and emailed to friends and colleagues.\n\n00:07:27.958 --> 00:07:30.958\nWhen do you see the dragonflies appear?\n\n00:07:30.958 --> 00:07:32.958\nAnd pretty soon, a picture started emerging.\n\n00:07:32.958 --> 00:07:34.958\nIn Bangalore, a colleague there sent me\n\n00:07:34.958 --> 00:07:36.958\ninformation for three years, average,\n\n00:07:36.958 --> 00:07:38.958\n24th of September, so late September.\n\n00:07:38.958 --> 00:07:40.958\nDown in Trivandrum, a bit later.\n\n00:07:40.958 --> 00:07:42.958\nFar north of Maldives, a bit later.\n\n00:07:42.958 --> 00:07:44.958\nThen Mal\u00e9, then further south.\n\n00:07:44.958 --> 00:07:46.958\nAnd then the southernmost Maldives.\n\n00:07:46.958 --> 00:07:49.958\nIt's pretty obvious, they're coming from India.\n\n00:07:49.958 --> 00:07:52.958\nBut they are coming 400 miles across the ocean, against the wind.\n\n00:07:52.958 --> 00:07:54.958\nHow on Earth are they doing that?\n\n00:07:54.958 --> 00:07:56.958\nI didn't know.\n\n00:07:56.958 --> 00:07:58.958\nThe next thing I did was I started counting dragonflies.\n\n00:07:58.958 --> 00:08:00.958\nI wanted to know about their seasonality,\n\n00:08:00.958 --> 00:08:02.958\nwhat time of year, this is when they first arrive,\n\n00:08:02.958 --> 00:08:04.958\nbut how long are they around for? Does that give any clues?\n\n00:08:04.958 --> 00:08:07.958\nSo, I started a very rigorous scientific process.\n\n00:08:07.958 --> 00:08:09.958\nI had a rigorous scientific transect.\n\n00:08:09.958 --> 00:08:11.958\nI got on my bicycle,\n\n00:08:11.958 --> 00:08:13.958\nand I cycled around the island of Mal\u00e9.\n\n00:08:13.958 --> 00:08:15.958\nIt's about five kilometers around,\n\n00:08:15.958 --> 00:08:17.958\ncounting the dragonflies as I go,\n\n00:08:17.958 --> 00:08:20.958\ntrying not to bump into people as I'm looking in the trees.\n\n00:08:20.958 --> 00:08:24.958\nAnd they're here for a very short time,\n\n00:08:24.958 --> 00:08:26.958\nOctober, November, December. That's it.\n\n00:08:26.958 --> 00:08:28.958\nAnd then they tail off, there's a few, but that's it.\n\n00:08:28.958 --> 00:08:30.958\nOctober, November, December. That is not the northeast monsoon season.\n\n00:08:30.958 --> 00:08:32.958\nThat's not the southwest season.\n\n00:08:32.958 --> 00:08:34.958\nThat's the inter-monsoon,\n\n00:08:34.958 --> 00:08:36.958\nthe time when the monsoon changes.\n\n00:08:36.958 --> 00:08:39.958\nNow, what I said was, you get the southwest monsoon going one way,\n\n00:08:39.958 --> 00:08:43.958\nand then it changes and you get the northeast monsoon going the other way.\n\n00:08:43.958 --> 00:08:45.958\nAnd that sort of gives the impression you've got one air mass\n\n00:08:45.958 --> 00:08:47.958\ngoing up and down, up and down. It doesn't work like that.\n\n00:08:47.958 --> 00:08:49.958\nWhat happens, actually, is there is two air masses.\n\n00:08:49.958 --> 00:08:52.958\nAnd there is a front between them, and the front moves.\n\n00:08:52.958 --> 00:08:54.958\nSo, if you've got India here,\n\n00:08:54.958 --> 00:08:56.958\nwhen the front is up above India you're into the southwest monsoon.\n\n00:08:56.958 --> 00:09:00.958\nThen the front moves into the northeast monsoon.\n\n00:09:00.958 --> 00:09:02.958\nAnd that front in the middle is not vertical,\n\n00:09:02.958 --> 00:09:04.958\nit's at an angle.\n\n00:09:04.958 --> 00:09:06.958\nSo, as it comes over towards Mal\u00e9\n\n00:09:06.958 --> 00:09:09.958\nI'm standing in Mal\u00e9 underneath the front.\n\n00:09:09.958 --> 00:09:11.958\nI can be in the southwest monsoon.\n\n00:09:11.958 --> 00:09:13.958\nBut the wind above is from the northeast monsoon.\n\n00:09:13.958 --> 00:09:16.958\nSo, the dragonflies are actually coming from India on the northeast monsoon,\n\n00:09:16.958 --> 00:09:22.958\nbut at an altitude at 1,000 to 2,000 meters up in the air. Incredible.\n\n00:09:22.958 --> 00:09:25.958\nThese little insects, it's the same ones we see out here [in India],\n\n00:09:25.958 --> 00:09:27.958\ntwo inches long, five centimeters long,\n\n00:09:27.958 --> 00:09:31.958\nflying in their millions, 400 miles across the ocean,\n\n00:09:31.958 --> 00:09:35.958\nat 2,000 meters up. Quite incredible.\n\n00:09:35.958 --> 00:09:38.958\nSo, I was quite pleased with myself. I thought wow, I've tracked this one,\n\n00:09:38.958 --> 00:09:40.958\nI know how they come here. Then I scratched my head a bit,\n\n00:09:40.958 --> 00:09:42.958\nand that's okay,\n\n00:09:42.958 --> 00:09:45.958\nI know how they come here, but why do they come here?\n\n00:09:45.958 --> 00:09:50.958\nWhat are millions of dragonflies doing, flying out over the ocean every year\n\n00:09:50.958 --> 00:09:52.958\nto their apparent doom?\n\n00:09:52.958 --> 00:09:54.958\nIt doesn't make sense. There is nothing for them in Maldives.\n\n00:09:54.958 --> 00:09:56.958\nWhat on Earth are they doing?\n\n00:09:56.958 --> 00:09:59.958\nWell, to cut a long story short,\n\n00:09:59.958 --> 00:10:02.958\nthey're actually flying right across the ocean.\n\n00:10:02.958 --> 00:10:05.958\nThey're making it all the way across to East Africa.\n\n00:10:05.958 --> 00:10:08.958\nI know that because I have friends who work on fisheries' research vessels\n\n00:10:08.958 --> 00:10:10.958\nwho have sent to me reports from boats out in the ocean.\n\n00:10:10.958 --> 00:10:12.958\nI know because we have reports from Seychelles,\n\n00:10:12.958 --> 00:10:14.958\nwhich fit in as well, down here.\n\n00:10:14.958 --> 00:10:17.958\nAnd I know because\n\n00:10:17.958 --> 00:10:19.958\nwhen you look at the rainfall,\n\n00:10:19.958 --> 00:10:21.958\nthese particular insects, these Globe Skimmers\n\n00:10:21.958 --> 00:10:25.958\nbreed in temporary rain water pools.\n\n00:10:25.958 --> 00:10:27.958\nOkay, they lay their eggs where the seasonal rains are,\n\n00:10:27.958 --> 00:10:29.958\nthe monsoon rains.\n\n00:10:29.958 --> 00:10:32.958\nThe larvae have to develop very quickly.\n\n00:10:32.958 --> 00:10:34.958\nThey only take six weeks. Instead of 11 months, they're six weeks.\n\n00:10:34.958 --> 00:10:36.958\nThey're up, and they're off.\n\n00:10:36.958 --> 00:10:38.958\nNow, here we have, in case you can't read at the back,\n\n00:10:38.958 --> 00:10:40.958\nthe top is rainfall for India.\n\n00:10:40.958 --> 00:10:43.958\nAnd we're starting in June. So this is the monsoon rain.\n\n00:10:43.958 --> 00:10:45.958\nBy September, October, it's drying out.\n\n00:10:45.958 --> 00:10:47.958\nNothing for these dragonflies. There is no more seasonal rain.\n\n00:10:47.958 --> 00:10:50.958\nThey've got to go hunting for seasonal rain.\n\n00:10:50.958 --> 00:10:53.958\nAnd they fly south. As the monsoon withdraws to the south\n\n00:10:53.958 --> 00:10:56.958\nthey come down through Karnataka, into Kerala.\n\n00:10:56.958 --> 00:10:58.958\nAnd then they run out of land.\n\n00:10:58.958 --> 00:11:00.958\nBut they are incredibly good fliers. This particular species,\n\n00:11:00.958 --> 00:11:02.958\nit can fly for thousands of kilometers.\n\n00:11:02.958 --> 00:11:04.958\nAnd it just keeps going. And the wind, the northeast wind\n\n00:11:04.958 --> 00:11:08.958\nswooshes it around and carries it off across the ocean to Africa,\n\n00:11:08.958 --> 00:11:11.958\nwhere it's raining.\n\n00:11:11.958 --> 00:11:13.958\nAnd they are breeding in the rains of Africa.\n\n00:11:13.958 --> 00:11:15.958\nNow, this is southeast Africa. It makes it look like there are sort of\n\n00:11:15.958 --> 00:11:19.958\ntwo breeding periods here. It's slightly more complicated than that.\n\n00:11:19.958 --> 00:11:22.958\nWhat's happening is they are breeding in the monsoon rains here.\n\n00:11:22.958 --> 00:11:25.958\nAnd the dragonflies you can see today\n\n00:11:25.958 --> 00:11:27.958\noutside here, on the campus,\n\n00:11:27.958 --> 00:11:30.958\nare the young of this generation.\n\n00:11:30.958 --> 00:11:32.958\nThey hatched out in India.\n\n00:11:32.958 --> 00:11:35.958\nThey're looking for somewhere to breed. If it rains here they'll breed.\n\n00:11:35.958 --> 00:11:37.958\nBut most of them are going to carry on. And next stop,\n\n00:11:37.958 --> 00:11:40.958\nperhaps only four or five days away is going to be East Africa.\n\n00:11:40.958 --> 00:11:42.958\nThe wind will swoosh them out across here.\n\n00:11:42.958 --> 00:11:45.958\nIf they pass the Maldives they might go and have a look,\n\n00:11:45.958 --> 00:11:47.958\nnothing there, they'll carry on.\n\n00:11:47.958 --> 00:11:52.958\nHere, here, Kenya, East Africa,\n\n00:11:52.958 --> 00:11:54.958\nthey've actually just come out of a long drought.\n\n00:11:54.958 --> 00:11:57.958\nJust last week the rains broke. The short rains broke\n\n00:11:57.958 --> 00:11:59.958\nand it's raining there now.\n\n00:11:59.958 --> 00:12:02.958\nAnd the dragonflies are there. I have reports from my various contacts.\n\n00:12:02.958 --> 00:12:04.958\nThe dragonflies are here now. They're breeding there.\n\n00:12:04.958 --> 00:12:07.958\nWhen those guys, they'll lay their eggs now.\n\n00:12:07.958 --> 00:12:09.958\nThey'll hatch out in six weeks. By that time\n\n00:12:09.958 --> 00:12:11.958\nthe seasonal rains have moved on. It's not there, it's down here.\n\n00:12:11.958 --> 00:12:13.958\nThey'll fly down here. And the clever thing is\n\n00:12:13.958 --> 00:12:16.958\nthe wind is always converging to where the rain is.\n\n00:12:16.958 --> 00:12:18.958\nThe rain occurs, these are summer rains.\n\n00:12:18.958 --> 00:12:20.958\nThis is a summer monsoon.\n\n00:12:20.958 --> 00:12:23.958\nThe sun is overhead there. Summer rains in southern Africa.\n\n00:12:23.958 --> 00:12:25.958\nThe sun is overhead, maximum heating,\n\n00:12:25.958 --> 00:12:27.958\nmaximum evaporation, maximum clouds,\n\n00:12:27.958 --> 00:12:29.958\nmaximum rainfall,\n\n00:12:29.958 --> 00:12:31.958\nmaximum opportunities for reproduction.\n\n00:12:31.958 --> 00:12:35.958\nNot only that, because you have this convection,\n\n00:12:35.958 --> 00:12:37.958\nyou have this rising of the air\n\n00:12:37.958 --> 00:12:39.958\nwhere it's hot, air is drawn in.\n\n00:12:39.958 --> 00:12:42.958\nThere's a convergence. So, wherever the rain is falling,\n\n00:12:42.958 --> 00:12:45.958\nthe air is drawn towards it to replace the air that's rising.\n\n00:12:45.958 --> 00:12:48.958\nSo, the little fellow that hatches out here,\n\n00:12:48.958 --> 00:12:50.958\nhe gets up into the air, he is automatically carried\n\n00:12:50.958 --> 00:12:52.958\nto where the rain is falling.\n\n00:12:52.958 --> 00:12:55.958\nLay their eggs, next generation, they come up,\n\n00:12:55.958 --> 00:12:57.958\nautomatically carried to where the rain is falling.\n\n00:12:57.958 --> 00:13:00.958\nIt's now back there. They come out, it's time to come back.\n\n00:13:00.958 --> 00:13:02.958\nSo, in four generations, one, two, three,\n\n00:13:02.958 --> 00:13:04.958\nfour and then back.\n\n00:13:04.958 --> 00:13:07.958\nA complete circuit of the Indian Ocean.\n\n00:13:07.958 --> 00:13:12.958\nThis is a circuit of about 16,000 kilometers.\n\n00:13:12.958 --> 00:13:16.958\n16,000 kilometers, four generations, mind you,\n\n00:13:16.958 --> 00:13:18.958\nfor a two inch long insect. It's quite incredible.\n\n00:13:18.958 --> 00:13:20.958\nThose of you from North America\n\n00:13:20.958 --> 00:13:23.958\nwill be familiar with the Monarch butterfly.\n\n00:13:23.958 --> 00:13:26.958\nWhich, up until now has had the longest known insect migration.\n\n00:13:26.958 --> 00:13:28.958\nIt's only half the length of this one.\n\n00:13:28.958 --> 00:13:30.958\nAnd this crossing here, of the ocean,\n\n00:13:30.958 --> 00:13:35.958\nis the only truly regular transoceanic crossing\n\n00:13:35.958 --> 00:13:37.958\nof any insect.\n\n00:13:37.958 --> 00:13:39.958\nA quite incredible feat.\n\n00:13:39.958 --> 00:13:41.958\nAnd I only stumbled on this because I was living in Mal\u00e9,\n\n00:13:41.958 --> 00:13:43.958\nin Maldives for long enough\n\n00:13:43.958 --> 00:13:45.958\nfor it to percolate into my brain\n\n00:13:45.958 --> 00:13:49.958\nthat something rather special was going on.\n\n00:13:49.958 --> 00:13:51.958\nBut dragonflies are not the only creatures that make the crossing.\n\n00:13:51.958 --> 00:13:53.958\nThere is more to the story.\n\n00:13:53.958 --> 00:13:55.958\nI'm also interested in birds. And I'm familiar\n\n00:13:55.958 --> 00:13:57.958\nwith this fellow. This is a rather special bird.\n\n00:13:57.958 --> 00:14:00.958\nIt's a falcon. It's called the eastern red-footed falcon, obviously.\n\n00:14:00.958 --> 00:14:02.958\nBut it's also called the Amur Falcon.\n\n00:14:02.958 --> 00:14:04.958\nAnd it's called the Amur Falcon\n\n00:14:04.958 --> 00:14:07.958\nbecause it breeds in Amurland.\n\n00:14:07.958 --> 00:14:09.958\nWhich is an area along the Amur River, which is up here.\n\n00:14:09.958 --> 00:14:11.958\nIt's the border, much of it is the border\n\n00:14:11.958 --> 00:14:14.958\nbetween China and Russia, up here in the far east.\n\n00:14:14.958 --> 00:14:16.958\nSo, Siberia, Manchuria.\n\n00:14:16.958 --> 00:14:18.958\nAnd that's where it breeds.\n\n00:14:18.958 --> 00:14:20.958\nAnd if you're a falcon it's quite a nice place to be in the summer.\n\n00:14:20.958 --> 00:14:22.958\nBut it's a pretty miserable place to be in the winter.\n\n00:14:22.958 --> 00:14:24.958\nIt's, well, you can imagine.\n\n00:14:24.958 --> 00:14:28.958\nSo, as any sensible bird would do,\n\n00:14:28.958 --> 00:14:31.958\nhe moves south. They move south. The whole population moves south.\n\n00:14:31.958 --> 00:14:33.958\nBut then the being sensible stopped.\n\n00:14:33.958 --> 00:14:35.958\nSo, now they don't stop here, or even down here.\n\n00:14:35.958 --> 00:14:37.958\nNo, they turn across here.\n\n00:14:37.958 --> 00:14:41.958\nThey have a little refueling stop in northeastern India.\n\n00:14:41.958 --> 00:14:44.958\nThey come to the latitude of about Mumbai or Goa.\n\n00:14:44.958 --> 00:14:46.958\nAnd then they strike out across the ocean, down to Kenya.\n\n00:14:46.958 --> 00:14:49.958\nAnd down here, and they winter down here [in southern Africa].\n\n00:14:49.958 --> 00:14:52.958\nIncredible. This is the most extraordinary migration\n\n00:14:52.958 --> 00:14:55.958\nof any bird of prey. A quite incredible migration.\n\n00:14:55.958 --> 00:14:57.958\nAnd they are not the only one that makes the crossing.\n\n00:14:57.958 --> 00:15:00.958\nThey have the most incredible journey, but several make the crossing from India\n\n00:15:00.958 --> 00:15:02.958\nto Africa. Includes this one, the hobby.\n\n00:15:02.958 --> 00:15:04.958\nThis fellow is a very nice bird, this is the Pied cuckoo.\n\n00:15:04.958 --> 00:15:06.958\nThose of you from northern India will be familiar with this.\n\n00:15:06.958 --> 00:15:08.958\nIt comes with the monsoons.\n\n00:15:08.958 --> 00:15:11.958\nThis time of year they cross back to Africa.\n\n00:15:11.958 --> 00:15:13.958\nAnd this guy, the roller, a rather beautiful bird.\n\n00:15:13.958 --> 00:15:16.958\nIt's known as the Eurasian Roller. In India it occurs in the northwest,\n\n00:15:16.958 --> 00:15:19.958\nso it's known as the Kashmir Roller.\n\n00:15:19.958 --> 00:15:21.958\nAnd these birds, what I've done is I've complied all the records,\n\n00:15:21.958 --> 00:15:23.958\nall the available records of these birds,\n\n00:15:23.958 --> 00:15:25.958\nput them together, and found out they migrate at exactly the same time\n\n00:15:25.958 --> 00:15:27.958\nas the dragonflies.\n\n00:15:27.958 --> 00:15:29.958\nThey make use of exactly the same winds.\n\n00:15:29.958 --> 00:15:31.958\nThey travel at exactly the same time with the same winds\n\n00:15:31.958 --> 00:15:34.958\nto make the crossing. I know they travel at the same altitude.\n\n00:15:34.958 --> 00:15:36.958\nIt's known about the Amur Falcon. This guy, unfortunately,\n\n00:15:36.958 --> 00:15:38.958\none of these met an unfortunate end.\n\n00:15:38.958 --> 00:15:41.958\nHe was flying off the coast of Goa,\n\n00:15:41.958 --> 00:15:44.958\n21 years ago, 1988. October, 1988.\n\n00:15:44.958 --> 00:15:46.958\nAn Indian Navy jet was flying off Goa,\n\n00:15:46.958 --> 00:15:49.958\nbang! In the middle of the night. Fortunately, a two engine jet\n\n00:15:49.958 --> 00:15:52.958\ngot back to base, and they pulled the remains of one of these [Eurasian Rollers] out.\n\n00:15:52.958 --> 00:15:56.958\nFlying at night over the Indian Ocean 2,424 meters.\n\n00:15:56.958 --> 00:15:58.958\nSame height as the dragonflies go.\n\n00:15:58.958 --> 00:16:00.958\nSo, they are using the same winds.\n\n00:16:00.958 --> 00:16:02.958\nAnd the other thing, the other important factor\n\n00:16:02.958 --> 00:16:05.958\nfor all these birds, all medium sized fellows,\n\n00:16:05.958 --> 00:16:08.958\nand this includes the next slide as well, which is a bee-eater.\n\n00:16:08.958 --> 00:16:10.958\nBee-eaters eat bees. This one has a nice blue cheek.\n\n00:16:10.958 --> 00:16:13.958\nIt's a Blue-cheeked Bee-eater.\n\n00:16:13.958 --> 00:16:15.958\nAnd every one of these birds that makes the crossing\n\n00:16:15.958 --> 00:16:17.958\nfrom India to East Africa\n\n00:16:17.958 --> 00:16:20.958\neats insects, large insects,\n\n00:16:20.958 --> 00:16:23.958\nthe size of dragonflies. Thank you very much.\n\n00:16:23.958 --> 00:16:28.958\n(Applause)"}, {"title": "Metaphorically speaking", "duration": "570", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/james_geary_metaphorically_speaking", "transcript": "Metaphor lives a secret life all around us. We utter about six metaphors a minute. Metaphorical thinking is essential to how we understand ourselves and others, how we communicate, learn, discover and invent. But metaphor is a way of thought before it is a way with words.Now, to assist me in explaining this, I've enlisted the help of one of our greatest philosophers, the reigning king of the metaphorians, a man whose contributions to the field are so great that he himself has become a metaphor. I am, of course, referring to none other than Elvis Presley. (Laughter)Now, \"All Shook Up\" is a great love song. It's also a great example of how whenever we deal with anything abstract \u2014 ideas, emotions, feelings, concepts, thoughts \u2014 we inevitably resort to metaphor. In \"All Shook Up,\" a touch is not a touch, but a chill. Lips are not lips, but volcanoes. She is not she, but a buttercup. And love is not love, but being all shook up.In this, Elvis is following Aristotle's classic definition of metaphor as the process of giving the thing a name that belongs to something else. This is the mathematics of metaphor. And fortunately it's very simple. X equals Y. (Laughter) This formula works wherever metaphor is present.Elvis uses it, but so does Shakespeare in this famous line from \"Romeo and Juliet:\" Juliet is the sun. Now, here, Shakespeare gives the thing, Juliet, a name that belongs to something else, the sun. But whenever we give a thing a name that belongs to something else, we give it a whole network of analogies too. We mix and match what we know about the metaphor's source, in this case the sun, with what we know about its target, Juliet. And metaphor gives us a much more vivid understanding of Juliet than if Shakespeare had literally described what she looks like.So, how do we make and understand metaphors? This might look familiar. The first step is pattern recognition. Look at this image. What do you see? Three wayward Pac-Men, and three pointy brackets are actually present. What we see, however, are two overlapping triangles. Metaphor is not just the detection of patterns; it is the creation of patterns. Second step, conceptual synesthesia.Now, synesthesia is the experience of a stimulus in once sense organ in another sense organ as well, such as colored hearing. People with colored hearing actually see colors when they hear the sounds of words or letters. We all have synesthetic abilities. This is the Bouba/Kiki test. What you have to do is identify which of these shapes is called Bouba, and which is called Kiki. (Laughter)If you are like 98 percent of other people, you will identify the round, amoeboid shape as Bouba, and the sharp, spiky one as Kiki. Can we do a quick show of hands? Does that correspond? Okay, I think 99.9 would about cover it. Why do we do that? Because we instinctively find, or create, a pattern between the round shape and the round sound of Bouba, and the spiky shape and the spiky sound of Kiki.And many of the metaphors we use everyday are synesthetic. Silence is sweet. Neckties are loud. Sexually attractive people are hot. Sexually unattractive people leave us cold. Metaphor creates a kind of conceptual synesthesia, in which we understand one concept in the context of another.Third step is cognitive dissonance. This is the Stroop test. What you need to do here is identify as quickly as possible the color of the ink in which these words are printed. You can take the test now. If you're like most people, you will experience a moment of cognitive dissonance when the name of the color is printed in a differently colored ink. The test shows that we cannot ignore the literal meaning of words even when the literal meaning gives the wrong answer.Stroop tests have been done with metaphor as well. The participants had to identify, as quickly as possible, the literally false sentences. They took longer to reject metaphors as false than they did to reject literally false sentences. Why? Because we cannot ignore the metaphorical meaning of words either.One of the sentences was, \"Some jobs are jails.\" Now, unless you're a prison guard, the sentence \"Some jobs are jails\" is literally false. Sadly, it's metaphorically true. And the metaphorical truth interferes with our ability to identify it as literally false. Metaphor matters because it's around us every day, all the time. Metaphor matters because it creates expectations.Pay careful attention the next time you read the financial news. Agent metaphors describe price movements as the deliberate action of a living thing, as in, \"The NASDAQ climbed higher.\" Object metaphors describe price movements as non-living things, as in, \"The Dow fell like a brick.\"Researchers asked a group of people to read a clutch of market commentaries, and then predict the next day's price trend. Those exposed to agent metaphors had higher expectations that price trends would continue. And they had those expectations because agent metaphors imply the deliberate action of a living thing pursuing a goal. If, for example, house prices are routinely described as climbing and climbing, higher and higher, people might naturally assume that that rise is unstoppable. They may feel confident, say, in taking out mortgages they really can't afford. That's a hypothetical example of course. But this is how metaphor misleads.Metaphor also matters because it influences decisions by activating analogies. A group of students was told that a small democratic country had been invaded and had asked the U.S. for help. And they had to make a decision. What should they do? Intervene, appeal to the U.N., or do nothing? They were each then given one of three descriptions of this hypothetical crisis. Each of which was designed to trigger a different historical analogy: World War II, Vietnam, and the third was historically neutral.Those exposed to the World War II scenario made more interventionist recommendations than the others. Just as we cannot ignore the literal meaning of words, we cannot ignore the analogies that are triggered by metaphor. Metaphor matters because it opens the door to discovery. Whenever we solve a problem, or make a discovery, we compare what we know with what we don't know. And the only way to find out about the latter is to investigate the ways it might be like the former.Einstein described his scientific method as combinatory play. He famously used thought experiments, which are essentially elaborate analogies, to come up with some of his greatest discoveries. By bringing together what we know and what we don't know through analogy, metaphorical thinking strikes the spark that ignites discovery.Now metaphor is ubiquitous, yet it's hidden. But you just have to look at the words around you and you'll find it. Ralph Waldo Emerson described language as \"fossil poetry.\" But before it was fossil poetry language was fossil metaphor. And these fossils still breathe.Take the three most famous words in all of Western philosophy: \"Cogito ergo sum.\" That's routinely translated as, \"I think, therefore I am.\" But there is a better translation. The Latin word \"cogito\" is derived from the prefix \"co,\" meaning \"together,\" and the verb \"agitare,\" meaning \"to shake.\" So, the original meaning of \"cogito\" is to shake together. And the proper translation of \"cogito ergo sum\" is \"I shake things up, therefore I am.\" (Laughter)Metaphor shakes things up, giving us everything from Shakespeare to scientific discovery in the process. The mind is a plastic snow dome, the most beautiful, most interesting, and most itself, when, as Elvis put it, it's all shook up. And metaphor keeps the mind shaking, rattling and rolling, long after Elvis has left the building. Thank you very much.

What do you see?\n\n00:02:38.958 --> 00:02:40.958\nThree wayward Pac-Men,\n\n00:02:40.958 --> 00:02:43.958\nand three pointy brackets are actually present.\n\n00:02:43.958 --> 00:02:45.958\nWhat we see, however,\n\n00:02:45.958 --> 00:02:47.958\nare two overlapping triangles.\n\n00:02:47.958 --> 00:02:50.958\nMetaphor is not just the detection of patterns;\n\n00:02:50.958 --> 00:02:52.958\nit is the creation of patterns.\n\n00:02:52.958 --> 00:02:55.958\nSecond step, conceptual synesthesia.\n\n00:02:55.958 --> 00:03:00.958\nNow, synesthesia is the experience of a stimulus in once sense organ\n\n00:03:00.958 --> 00:03:02.958\nin another sense organ as well,\n\n00:03:02.958 --> 00:03:04.958\nsuch as colored hearing.\n\n00:03:04.958 --> 00:03:06.958\nPeople with colored hearing\n\n00:03:06.958 --> 00:03:09.958\nactually see colors when they hear the sounds\n\n00:03:09.958 --> 00:03:11.958\nof words or letters.\n\n00:03:11.958 --> 00:03:13.958\nWe all have synesthetic abilities.\n\n00:03:13.958 --> 00:03:16.958\nThis is the Bouba/Kiki test.\n\n00:03:16.958 --> 00:03:18.958\nWhat you have to do is identify which of these shapes\n\n00:03:18.958 --> 00:03:22.958\nis called Bouba, and which is called Kiki.\n\n00:03:22.958 --> 00:03:23.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:03:23.958 --> 00:03:25.958\nIf you are like 98 percent of other people,\n\n00:03:25.958 --> 00:03:29.958\nyou will identify the round, amoeboid shape as Bouba,\n\n00:03:29.958 --> 00:03:32.958\nand the sharp, spiky one as Kiki.\n\n00:03:32.958 --> 00:03:34.958\nCan we do a quick show of hands?\n\n00:03:34.958 --> 00:03:36.958\nDoes that correspond?\n\n00:03:36.958 --> 00:03:40.958\nOkay, I think 99.9 would about cover it.\n\n00:03:40.958 --> 00:03:42.958\nWhy do we do that?\n\n00:03:42.958 --> 00:03:46.958\nBecause we instinctively find, or create,\n\n00:03:46.958 --> 00:03:48.958\na pattern between the round shape\n\n00:03:48.958 --> 00:03:51.958\nand the round sound of Bouba,\n\n00:03:51.958 --> 00:03:56.958\nand the spiky shape and the spiky sound of Kiki.\n\n00:03:56.958 --> 00:04:00.958\nAnd many of the metaphors we use everyday are synesthetic.\n\n00:04:00.958 --> 00:04:02.958\nSilence is sweet.\n\n00:04:02.958 --> 00:04:04.958\nNeckties are loud.\n\n00:04:04.958 --> 00:04:07.958\nSexually attractive people are hot.\n\n00:04:07.958 --> 00:04:10.958\nSexually unattractive people leave us cold.\n\n00:04:10.958 --> 00:04:13.958\nMetaphor creates a kind of conceptual synesthesia,\n\n00:04:13.958 --> 00:04:15.958\nin which we understand one concept\n\n00:04:15.958 --> 00:04:18.958\nin the context of another.\n\n00:04:18.958 --> 00:04:20.958\nThird step is cognitive dissonance.\n\n00:04:20.958 --> 00:04:22.958\nThis is the Stroop test.\n\n00:04:22.958 --> 00:04:24.958\nWhat you need to do here is identify\n\n00:04:24.958 --> 00:04:26.958\nas quickly as possible\n\n00:04:26.958 --> 00:04:29.958\nthe color of the ink in which these words are printed.\n\n00:04:29.958 --> 00:04:33.958\nYou can take the test now.\n\n00:04:33.958 --> 00:04:35.958\nIf you're like most people, you will experience\n\n00:04:35.958 --> 00:04:37.958\na moment of cognitive dissonance\n\n00:04:37.958 --> 00:04:40.958\nwhen the name of the color\n\n00:04:40.958 --> 00:04:42.958\nis printed in a differently colored ink.\n\n00:04:42.958 --> 00:04:45.958\nThe test shows that we cannot ignore the literal meaning of words\n\n00:04:45.958 --> 00:04:48.958\neven when the literal meaning gives the wrong answer.\n\n00:04:48.958 --> 00:04:50.958\nStroop tests have been done with metaphor as well.\n\n00:04:50.958 --> 00:04:54.958\nThe participants had to identify, as quickly as possible,\n\n00:04:54.958 --> 00:04:56.958\nthe literally false sentences.\n\n00:04:56.958 --> 00:04:59.958\nThey took longer to reject metaphors as false\n\n00:04:59.958 --> 00:05:02.958\nthan they did to reject literally false sentences.\n\n00:05:02.958 --> 00:05:05.958\nWhy? Because we cannot ignore\n\n00:05:05.958 --> 00:05:08.958\nthe metaphorical meaning of words either.\n\n00:05:08.958 --> 00:05:11.958\nOne of the sentences was, \"Some jobs are jails.\"\n\n00:05:11.958 --> 00:05:14.958\nNow, unless you're a prison guard,\n\n00:05:14.958 --> 00:05:17.958\nthe sentence \"Some jobs are jails\" is literally false.\n\n00:05:17.958 --> 00:05:20.958\nSadly, it's metaphorically true.\n\n00:05:20.958 --> 00:05:23.958\nAnd the metaphorical truth interferes with our ability\n\n00:05:23.958 --> 00:05:25.958\nto identify it as literally false.\n\n00:05:25.958 --> 00:05:27.958\nMetaphor matters because\n\n00:05:27.958 --> 00:05:30.958\nit's around us every day, all the time.\n\n00:05:30.958 --> 00:05:33.958\nMetaphor matters because it creates expectations.\n\n00:05:33.958 --> 00:05:37.958\nPay careful attention the next time you read the financial news.\n\n00:05:37.958 --> 00:05:39.958\nAgent metaphors describe price movements\n\n00:05:39.958 --> 00:05:41.958\nas the deliberate action of a living thing,\n\n00:05:41.958 --> 00:05:45.958\nas in, \"The NASDAQ climbed higher.\"\n\n00:05:45.958 --> 00:05:48.958\nObject metaphors describe price movements\n\n00:05:48.958 --> 00:05:50.958\nas non-living things,\n\n00:05:50.958 --> 00:05:53.958\nas in, \"The Dow fell like a brick.\"\n\n00:05:53.958 --> 00:05:55.958\nResearchers asked a group of people\n\n00:05:55.958 --> 00:05:57.958\nto read a clutch of market commentaries,\n\n00:05:57.958 --> 00:06:00.958\nand then predict the next day's price trend.\n\n00:06:00.958 --> 00:06:02.958\nThose exposed to agent metaphors\n\n00:06:02.958 --> 00:06:05.958\nhad higher expectations that price trends would continue.\n\n00:06:05.958 --> 00:06:07.958\nAnd they had those expectations because\n\n00:06:07.958 --> 00:06:10.958\nagent metaphors imply the deliberate action\n\n00:06:10.958 --> 00:06:13.958\nof a living thing pursuing a goal.\n\n00:06:13.958 --> 00:06:15.958\nIf, for example, house prices\n\n00:06:15.958 --> 00:06:18.958\nare routinely described as climbing and climbing,\n\n00:06:18.958 --> 00:06:20.958\nhigher and higher, people might naturally assume\n\n00:06:20.958 --> 00:06:22.958\nthat that rise is unstoppable.\n\n00:06:22.958 --> 00:06:24.958\nThey may feel confident, say,\n\n00:06:24.958 --> 00:06:27.958\nin taking out mortgages they really can't afford.\n\n00:06:27.958 --> 00:06:30.958\nThat's a hypothetical example of course.\n\n00:06:30.958 --> 00:06:34.958\nBut this is how metaphor misleads.\n\n00:06:34.958 --> 00:06:37.958\nMetaphor also matters because it influences decisions\n\n00:06:37.958 --> 00:06:40.958\nby activating analogies.\n\n00:06:40.958 --> 00:06:42.958\nA group of students was told that a small democratic country\n\n00:06:42.958 --> 00:06:45.958\nhad been invaded and had asked the U.S. for help.\n\n00:06:45.958 --> 00:06:47.958\nAnd they had to make a decision.\n\n00:06:47.958 --> 00:06:49.958\nWhat should they do?\n\n00:06:49.958 --> 00:06:52.958\nIntervene, appeal to the U.N., or do nothing?\n\n00:06:52.958 --> 00:06:54.958\nThey were each then given one of three\n\n00:06:54.958 --> 00:06:56.958\ndescriptions of this hypothetical crisis.\n\n00:06:56.958 --> 00:06:59.958\nEach of which was designed to trigger\n\n00:06:59.958 --> 00:07:01.958\na different historical analogy:\n\n00:07:01.958 --> 00:07:03.958\nWorld War II, Vietnam,\n\n00:07:03.958 --> 00:07:06.958\nand the third was historically neutral.\n\n00:07:06.958 --> 00:07:08.958\nThose exposed to the World War II scenario\n\n00:07:08.958 --> 00:07:10.958\nmade more interventionist recommendations\n\n00:07:10.958 --> 00:07:12.958\nthan the others.\n\n00:07:12.958 --> 00:07:15.958\nJust as we cannot ignore the literal meaning of words,\n\n00:07:15.958 --> 00:07:17.958\nwe cannot ignore the analogies\n\n00:07:17.958 --> 00:07:21.958\nthat are triggered by metaphor.\n\n00:07:21.958 --> 00:07:24.958\nMetaphor matters because it opens the door to discovery.\n\n00:07:24.958 --> 00:07:27.958\nWhenever we solve a problem, or make a discovery,\n\n00:07:27.958 --> 00:07:30.958\nwe compare what we know with what we don't know.\n\n00:07:30.958 --> 00:07:32.958\nAnd the only way to find out about the latter\n\n00:07:32.958 --> 00:07:36.958\nis to investigate the ways it might be like the former.\n\n00:07:36.958 --> 00:07:40.958\nEinstein described his scientific method as combinatory play.\n\n00:07:40.958 --> 00:07:42.958\nHe famously used thought experiments,\n\n00:07:42.958 --> 00:07:45.958\nwhich are essentially elaborate analogies,\n\n00:07:45.958 --> 00:07:48.958\nto come up with some of his greatest discoveries.\n\n00:07:48.958 --> 00:07:50.958\nBy bringing together what we know\n\n00:07:50.958 --> 00:07:52.958\nand what we don't know through analogy,\n\n00:07:52.958 --> 00:07:54.958\nmetaphorical thinking strikes the spark\n\n00:07:54.958 --> 00:07:58.958\nthat ignites discovery.\n\n00:07:58.958 --> 00:08:02.958\nNow metaphor is ubiquitous, yet it's hidden.\n\n00:08:02.958 --> 00:08:05.958\nBut you just have to look at the words around you\n\n00:08:05.958 --> 00:08:07.958\nand you'll find it.\n\n00:08:07.958 --> 00:08:09.958\nRalph Waldo Emerson described language\n\n00:08:09.958 --> 00:08:11.958\nas \"fossil poetry.\"\n\n00:08:11.958 --> 00:08:13.958\nBut before it was fossil poetry\n\n00:08:13.958 --> 00:08:16.958\nlanguage was fossil metaphor.\n\n00:08:16.958 --> 00:08:19.958\nAnd these fossils still breathe.\n\n00:08:19.958 --> 00:08:24.958\nTake the three most famous words in all of Western philosophy:\n\n00:08:24.958 --> 00:08:26.958\n\"Cogito ergo sum.\"\n\n00:08:26.958 --> 00:08:30.958\nThat's routinely translated as, \"I think, therefore I am.\"\n\n00:08:30.958 --> 00:08:32.958\nBut there is a better translation.\n\n00:08:32.958 --> 00:08:34.958\nThe Latin word \"cogito\"\n\n00:08:34.958 --> 00:08:37.958\nis derived from the prefix \"co,\" meaning \"together,\"\n\n00:08:37.958 --> 00:08:40.958\nand the verb \"agitare,\" meaning \"to shake.\"\n\n00:08:40.958 --> 00:08:43.958\nSo, the original meaning of \"cogito\"\n\n00:08:43.958 --> 00:08:45.958\nis to shake together.\n\n00:08:45.958 --> 00:08:48.958\nAnd the proper translation of \"cogito ergo sum\"\n\n00:08:48.958 --> 00:08:52.958\nis \"I shake things up, therefore I am.\"\n\n00:08:52.958 --> 00:08:54.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:08:54.958 --> 00:08:56.958\nMetaphor shakes things up,\n\n00:08:56.958 --> 00:09:01.958\ngiving us everything from Shakespeare to scientific discovery in the process.\n\n00:09:01.958 --> 00:09:04.958\nThe mind is a plastic snow dome,\n\n00:09:04.958 --> 00:09:06.958\nthe most beautiful, most interesting,\n\n00:09:06.958 --> 00:09:09.958\nand most itself, when, as Elvis put it,\n\n00:09:09.958 --> 00:09:11.958\nit's all shook up.\n\n00:09:11.958 --> 00:09:13.958\nAnd metaphor keeps the mind shaking,\n\n00:09:13.958 --> 00:09:16.958\nrattling and rolling, long after Elvis has left the building.\n\n00:09:16.958 --> 00:09:18.958\nThank you very much.\n\n00:09:18.958 --> 00:09:20.958\n(Applause)"}, {"title": "A new way to fight corruption", "duration": "641", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/shaffi_mather_a_new_way_to_fight_corruption",

My experiences over the last 18 months, as a lawyer, has seeded in me a new entrepreneurial idea, which I believe is indeed worth spreading. So, I share it with all of you here today, though the idea itself is getting crystallized and I'm still writing up the business plan. Of course it helps that fear of public failure diminishes as the number of ideas which have failed increases.I've been a huge fan of enterprise and entrepreneurship since 1993. I've explored, experienced, and experimented enterprise and capitalism to my heart's content. I built, along with my two brothers, the leading real estate company in my home state, Kerala, and then worked professionally with two of India's biggest businessmen, but in their startup enterprises. In 2003, when I stepped out of the pure play capitalistic sector to work on so-called social sector issues, I definitely did not have any grand strategy or plan to pursue and find for-profit solutions to addressing pressing public issues.When life brought about a series of death and near-death experiences within my close circle, which highlighted the need for an emergency medical response service in India, similar to 911 in USA. To address this, I, along with four friends, founded Ambulance Access for All, to promote life-support ambulance services in India. For those from the developing world, there is nothing, absolutely nothing new in this idea. But as we envisioned it, we had three key goals: Providing world-class life support ambulance service which is fully self-sustainable from its own revenue streams, and universally accessible to anyone in a medical emergency, irrespective of the capability to pay. The service which grew out of this, Dial 1298 for Ambulance, with one ambulance in 2004, now has a hundred-plus ambulances in three states, and has transported over 100,000 patients and victims since inception.The service is \u2014 (Applause) fully self-sustainable from its own revenues, without accessing any public funds, and the cross-subsidy model actually works, where the rich pays higher, poor pays lower, and the accident victim is getting the service free of charge. The service responded effectively and efficiently, during the unfortunate 26/11 Mumbai terror attacks. And as you can see from the visuals, the service was responding and rescuing victims from the incident locations even before the police could cordon off the incident locations and formally confirm it as a terror strike. We ended up being the first medical response team in every incident location and transported 125 victims, saving life.(Applause)In tribute and remembrance of 26/11 attacks over the last one year, we have actually helped a Pakistani NGO, Aman Foundation, to set up a self-sustainable life support ambulance service in Karachi, facilitated by Acumen Fund.(Applause)It's a small message from us, in our own small way to the enemies of humanity, of Islam, of South Asia, of India, and of Pakistan, that humanity will continue to bloom, irrespective of such dastardly attacks. Since then I've also co-founded two other social enterprises. One is Education Access for All, setting up schools in small-town India. And the other is Moksha-Yug Access, which is integrating rural supply chain on the foundations of self-help group-based microfinance. I guess we seem to be doing at least a few things right. Because diligent investors and venture funds have committed over 7.5 million dollars in funding. With the significance being these funds have come in as a QT capital, not as grant or as philanthropy.Now I come back to the idea of the new social enterprise that I'm exploring. Corruption, bribes, and lack of transparency. You may be surprised to know that eight speakers yesterday actually mentioned these terms in their talks. Bribes and corruption have both a demand and a supply side, with the supply side being mostly of greedy corporate unethical businesses and hapless common man. And the demand side being mostly politicians, bureaucrats and those who have discretionary power vested with them.According to World Bank estimate, one trillion dollars is paid in bribes every year, worsening the condition of the already worse off. Yet, if you analyze the common man, he or she does not wake up every day and say, \"Hmm, let me see who I can pay a bribe to today.\" or, \"Let me see who I can corrupt today.\" Often it is the constraining or the back-to-the-wall situation that the hapless common man finds himself or herself in that leads him to pay a bribe. In the modern day world, where time is premium and battle for subsistence is unimaginably tough, the hapless common man simply gives in and pays the bribe just to get on with life.Now, let me ask you another question. Imagine you are being asked to pay a bribe in your day-to-day life to get something done. What do you do? Of course you can call the police. But what is the use if the police department is in itself steeped in corruption? Most definitely you don't want to pay the bribe. But you also don't have the time, resources, expertise or wherewithal to fight this. Unfortunately, many of us in this room are supporters of capitalist policies and market forces.Yet the market forces around the world have not yet thrown up a service where you can call in, pay a fee, and fight the demand for a bribe. Like a bribe buster service, or 1-800-Fight-Bribes, or www.stopbribes.org or www.preventcorruption.org. Such a service simply do not exist. One image that has haunted me from my early business days is of a grandmother, 70 plus years, being harassed by the bureaucrats in the town planning office. All she needed was permission to build three steps to her house, from ground level, making it easier for her to enter and exit her house. Yet the officer in charge would not simply give her the permit for want of a bribe. Even though it pricked my conscience then, I could not, or rather I did not tend to her or assist her, because I was busy building my real estate company. I don't want to be haunted by such images any more.A group of us have been working on a pilot basis to address individual instances of demands for bribes for common services or entitlement. And in all 42 cases where we have pushed back such demands using existing and legitimate tools like the Right to Information Act, video, audio, or peer pressure, we have successfully obtained whatever our clients set out to achieve without actually paying a bribe. And with the cost of these tools being substantially lower than the bribe demanded. I believe that these tools that worked in these 42 pilot cases can be consolidated in standard processes in a BPO kind of environment, and made available on web, call-center and franchise physical offices, for a fee, to serve anyone confronted with a demand for a bribe. The target market is as tempting as it can get. It can be worth up to one trillion dollars, being paid in bribes every year, or equal to India's GDP. And it is an absolutely virgin market.I propose to explore this idea further, to examine the potential of creating a for-profit, fee-based BPO kind of service to stop bribes and prevent corruption. I do realize that the fight for justice against corruption is never easy. It never has been and it never will be. In my last 18 months as a lawyer, battling small- and large-scale corruption, including the one perpetrated by India's biggest corporate scamster. Through his charities I have had three police cases filed against me alleging trespass, impersonation and intimidation. The battle against corruption exacts a toll on ourselves, our families, our friends, and even our kids. Yet I believe the price we pay is well worth holding on to our dignity and making the world a fairer place.What gives us the courage? As my close friend replied, when told during the seeding days of the ambulance project that it is an impossible task and the founders are insane to chalk up their blue-chip jobs, I quote: \"Of course we cannot fail in this, at least in our own minds. For we are insane people, trying to do an impossible task. And an insane person does not know what an impossible task is.\" Thank you.(Applause)Chris Anderson: Shaffi, that is a really exciting business idea. Shaffi Mather: I just have to get through the initial days where I don't get eliminated.(Laughter)CA: What's on your mind? I mean, give us a sense of the numbers here \u2014 a typical bribe and a typical fee. I mean, what's in your head?SM: So let me ... Let me give you an example. Somebody who had applied for the passport. The officer was just sitting on it and was demanding around 3,000 rupees in bribes. And he did not want to pay. So we actually used the Right to Information Act, which is equal to the Freedom of Information Act in the United States, and pushed back the officers in this particular case. And in all these 42 cases, when we kept pushing them back, there was three kinds of reaction. A set of people actually say, \"Oh, let me just grant it to them, and run away from it.\" Some people actually come back and say, \"Oh, you want to screw me. Let me show you what I can do.\" And he will push us back. So you take the next step, or use the next tool available in what we are putting together, and then he relents. By the third time, in all 42 cases, we have achieved success.CA: But if it's a 3,000-rupee, 70-dollar bribe, what fee would you have to charge, and can you actually make the business work?SM: Well, actually the cost that we incurred was less than 200 rupees. So, it actually works.CA: That's a high gross margin business. I like it.(Laughter)SM: I actually did not want to answer this on the TED stage.CA: OK, so these are provisional numbers, no pricing guarantee. If you can pull this off, you will be a global hero. I mean, this could be huge. Thank you so much for sharing this idea at TED.(Applause)", "id": 717, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:11.958 --> 00:00:15.958\nThe anger in me against

me\n\n00:07:23.958 --> 00:07:25.958\nfrom my early business days\n\n00:07:25.958 --> 00:07:28.958\nis of a grandmother, 70 plus years, being harassed\n\n00:07:28.958 --> 00:07:31.958\nby the bureaucrats in the town planning office.\n\n00:07:31.958 --> 00:07:33.958\nAll she needed was permission to build three steps\n\n00:07:33.958 --> 00:07:35.958\nto her house, from ground level,\n\n00:07:35.958 --> 00:07:38.958\nmaking it easier for her to enter and exit her house.\n\n00:07:38.958 --> 00:07:41.958\nYet the officer in charge would not simply give her the permit\n\n00:07:41.958 --> 00:07:43.958\nfor want of a bribe.\n\n00:07:43.958 --> 00:07:45.958\nEven though it pricked my conscience then,\n\n00:07:45.958 --> 00:07:47.958\nI could not, or rather I did not\n\n00:07:47.958 --> 00:07:50.958\ntend to her or assist her,\n\n00:07:50.958 --> 00:07:52.958\nbecause I was busy building my real estate company.\n\n00:07:52.958 --> 00:07:56.958\nI don't want to be haunted by such images any more.\n\n00:07:56.958 --> 00:07:58.958\nA group of us have been working on a pilot basis\n\n00:07:58.958 --> 00:08:01.958\nto address individual instances of demands\n\n00:08:01.958 --> 00:08:04.958\nfor bribes for common services or entitlement.\n\n00:08:04.958 --> 00:08:07.958\nAnd in all 42 cases where we have pushed back such demands\n\n00:08:07.958 --> 00:08:10.958\nusing existing and legitimate tools\n\n00:08:10.958 --> 00:08:12.958\nlike the Right to Information Act,\n\n00:08:12.958 --> 00:08:15.958\nvideo, audio, or peer pressure,\n\n00:08:15.958 --> 00:08:17.958\nwe have successfully obtained whatever our clients\n\n00:08:17.958 --> 00:08:21.958\nset out to achieve without actually paying a bribe.\n\n00:08:21.958 --> 00:08:24.958\nAnd with the cost of these tools being substantially lower\n\n00:08:24.958 --> 00:08:26.958\nthan the bribe demanded.\n\n00:08:26.958 --> 00:08:31.958\nI believe that these tools that worked in these 42 pilot cases\n\n00:08:31.958 --> 00:08:35.958\ncan be consolidated in standard processes\n\n00:08:35.958 --> 00:08:38.958\nin a BPO kind of environment,\n\n00:08:38.958 -->

00:09:05.958\nI propose to explore this idea further,\n\n00:09:05.958 --> 00:09:07.958\nto examine the potential of creating\n\n00:09:07.958 --> 00:09:11.958\na for-profit, fee-based

justice\n\n00:09:18.958 --> 00:09:21.958\nagainst corruption is never easy.\n\n00:09:21.958 --> 00:09:23.958\nIt never has been and it never will be.\n\n00:09:23.958 --> 00:09:26.958\nIn my last 18

We've known about fusion since 1920, when Sir Arthur Stanley Eddington and the British Association for the Advancement of Science conjectured that that's why the sun shines.I've always been very worried about resource. I don't know about you, but when my mother gave me food, I always sorted the ones I disliked from the ones I liked. And I ate the disliked ones first, because the ones you like, you want to save. And as a child you're always worried about resource. And once it was sort of explained to me how fast we were using up the world's resources, I got very upset, about as upset as I did when I realized that the Earth will only last about five billion years before it's swallowed by the sun. Big events in my life, a strange child. (Laughter)Energy, at the moment, is dominated by resource. The countries that make a lot of money out of energy have something underneath them. Coal-powered industrial revolution in this country \u2014 oil, gas, sorry. (Laughter) Gas, I'm probably the only person who really enjoys it when Mister Putin turns off the gas tap, because my budget goes up.We're really dominated now by those things that we're using up faster and faster and faster. And as we try to lift billions of people out of poverty in the Third World, in the developing world, we're using energy faster and faster. And those resources are going away. And the way we'll make energy in the future is not from resource, it's really from knowledge. If you look 50 years into the future, the way we probably will be making energy is probably one of these three, with some wind, with some other things, but these are going to be the base load energy drivers.Solar can do it, and we certainly have to develop solar. But we have a lot of knowledge to gain before we can make solar the base load energy supply for the world. Fission. Our government is going to put in six new nuclear power stations. They're going to put in six new nuclear power stations, and probably more after that. China is building nuclear power stations. Everybody is. Because they know that that is one sure way to do carbon-free energy.But if you wanted to know what the perfect energy source is, the perfect energy source is one that doesn't take up much space, has a virtually inexhaustible supply, is safe, doesn't put any carbon into the atmosphere, doesn't leave any long-lived radioactive waste: it's fusion. But there is a catch. Of course there is always a catch in these cases. Fusion is very hard to do. We've been trying for 50 years.Okay. What is fusion? Here comes the nuclear physics. And sorry about that, but this is what turns me on. (Laughter) I was a strange child. Nuclear energy comes for a simple reason. The most stable nucleus is iron, right in the middle of the periodic table. It's a medium-sized nucleus. And you want to go towards iron if you want to get energy. So, uranium, which is very big, wants to split. But small atoms want to join together, small nuclei want to join together to make bigger ones to go towards iron.And you can get energy out this way. And indeed that's exactly what stars do. In the middle of stars, you're joining hydrogen together to make helium and then helium together to make carbon, to make oxygen, all the things that you're made of are made in the middle of stars. But it's a hard process to do because, as you know, the middle of a star is quite hot, almost by definition. And there is one reaction that's probably the easiest fusion reaction to do. It's between two isotopes of hydrogen, two kinds of hydrogen: deuterium, which is heavy hydrogen, which you can get from seawater, and tritium which is super-heavy hydrogen.These two nuclei, when they're far apart, are charged. And you push them together and they repel. But when you get them close enough, something called the strong force starts to act and pulls them together. So, most of the time they repel. You get them closer and closer and closer and then at some point the strong force grips them together. For a moment they become helium 5, because they've got five particles inside them.So, that's that process there. Deuterium and tritium goes together makes helium 5. Helium splits out, and a neutron comes out and lots of energy comes out. If you can get something to about 150 million degrees, things will be rattling around so fast that every time they collide in just the right configuration, this will happen, and it will release energy. And that energy is what powers fusion. And it's this reaction that we want to do.There is one trickiness about this reaction. Well, there is a trickiness that you have to make it 150 million degrees, but there is a trickiness about the reaction yet. It's pretty hot. The trickiness about the reaction is that tritium doesn't exist in nature. You have to make it from something else. And you make if from lithium. That reaction at the bottom, that's lithium 6, plus a neutron, will give you more helium, plus tritium. And that's the way you make your tritium. But fortunately, if you can do this fusion reaction, you've got a neutron, so you can make that happen.Now, why the hell would we bother to do this? This is basically why we would bother to do it. If you just plot how much fuel we've got left, in units of present world consumption. And as you go across there you see a few tens of years of oil \u2014 the blue line, by the way, is the lowest estimate of existing resources. And the yellow line is the most optimistic estimate.And as you go across there you will see that we've got a few tens of years, and perhaps 100 years of fossil fuels left. And god knows we don't really want to burn all of it, because it will make an awful lot of carbon in the air. And then we get to uranium. And with current reactor technology we really don't have very much uranium. And we will have to extract uranium from sea water, which is the yellow line, to make conventional nuclear power stations actually do very much for us. This is a bit shocking, because in fact our government is relying on that for us to meet Kyoto, and do all those kind of things.To go any further you would have to have breeder technology. And breeder technology is fast breeders. And that's pretty dangerous. The big thing, on the right, is the lithium we have in the world. And lithium is in sea water. That's the yellow line. And we have 30 million years worth of fusion fuel in sea water. Everybody can get it. That's why we want to do fusion. Is it cost-competitive? We make estimates of what we think it would cost to actually make a fusion power plant. And we get within about the same price as current electricity.So, how would we make it? We have to hold something at 150 million degrees. And, in fact, we've done this. We hold it with a magnetic field. And inside it, right in the middle of this toroidal shape, doughnut shape, right in the middle is 150 million degrees. It boils away in the middle at 150 million degrees. And in fact we can make fusion happen. And just down the road, this is JET. It's the only machine in the world that's actually done fusion.When people say fusion is 30 years away, and always will be, I say, \"Yeah, but we've actually done it.\" Right? We can do fusion. In the center of this device we made 16 megawatts of fusion power in 1997. And in 2013 we're going to fire it up again and break all those records. But that's not really fusion power. That's just making some fusion happen. We've got to take that, we've got to make that into a fusion reactor. Because we want 30 million years worth of fusion power for the Earth. This is the device we're building now.It gets very expensive to do this research. It turns out you can't do fusion on a table top despite all that cold fusion nonsense. Right? You can't. You have to do it in a very big device. More than half the world's population is involved in building this device in southern France, which is a nice place to put an experiment. Seven nations are involved in building this. It's going to cost us 10 billion. And we'll produce half a gigawatt of fusion power. But that's not electricity yet. We have to get to this. We have to get to a power plant. We have to start putting electricity on the grid in this very complex technology. And I'd really like it to happen a lot faster than it is. But at the moment, all we can imagine is sometime in the 2030s.I wish this were different. We really need it now. We're going to have a problem with power in the next five years in this country. So 2030 looks like an infinity away. But we can't abandon it now; we have to push forward, get fusion to happen. I wish we had more money, I wish we had more resources. But this is what we're aiming at, sometime in the 2030s \u2014 real electric power from fusion. Thank you very much.

What is fusion? Here comes the nuclear physics.\n\n00:03:24.958 --> 00:03:27.958\nAnd sorry about that, but this is what turns me on.\n\n00:03:27.958 --> 00:03:29.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:03:29.958 --> 00:03:33.958\nI was a strange child.\n\n00:03:33.958 --> 00:03:37.958\nNuclear energy comes for a simple reason.\n\n00:03:37.958 --> 00:03:41.958\nThe most stable nucleus is iron, right in the middle of the periodic table.\n\n00:03:41.958 --> 00:03:43.958\nIt's a medium-sized nucleus.\n\n00:03:43.958 --> 00:03:47.958\nAnd you want to go towards iron if you want to get energy.\n\n00:03:47.958 --> 00:03:50.958\nSo, uranium, which is very big, wants to split.\n\n00:03:50.958 --> 00:03:53.958\nBut small atoms want to join together,\n\n00:03:53.958 --> 00:03:55.958\nsmall nuclei want to join together\n\n00:03:55.958 --> 00:03:57.958\nto make bigger ones to go towards iron.\n\n00:03:57.958 --> 00:03:59.958\nAnd you can get energy out this way.\n\n00:03:59.958 --> 00:04:01.958\nAnd indeed that's exactly what stars do.\n\n00:04:01.958 --> 00:04:05.958\nIn the middle of stars, you're joining hydrogen together to make helium\n\n00:04:05.958 --> 00:04:07.958\nand then helium together to make carbon,\n\n00:04:07.958 --> 00:04:09.958\nto make oxygen, all the things that you're made of\n\n00:04:09.958 --> 00:04:12.958\nare made in the middle of stars.\n\n00:04:12.958 --> 00:04:14.958\nBut it's a hard process to do\n\n00:04:14.958 --> 00:04:17.958\nbecause, as you know, the middle of a star is quite hot,\n\n00:04:17.958 --> 00:04:21.958\nalmost by definition.\n\n00:04:21.958 --> 00:04:24.958\nAnd there is one reaction\n\n00:04:24.958 --> 00:04:29.958\nthat's probably the easiest fusion reaction to do.\n\n00:04:29.958 --> 00:04:33.958\nIt's between two isotopes of hydrogen, two kinds of hydrogen:\n\n00:04:33.958 --> 00:04:36.958\ndeuterium, which is heavy hydrogen,\n\n00:04:36.958 --> 00:04:38.958\nwhich you can get from seawater,\n\n00:04:38.958 --> 00:04:42.958\nand tritium which is super-heavy hydrogen.\n\n00:04:42.958 --> 00:04:46.958\nThese two nuclei, when they're far apart, are charged.\n\n00:04:46.958 --> 00:04:49.958\nAnd you push them together and they repel.\n\n00:04:49.958 --> 00:04:51.958\nBut when you get them close enough,\n\n00:04:51.958 --> 00:04:53.958\nsomething called the strong force starts to act\n\n00:04:53.958 --> 00:04:55.958\nand pulls them together.\n\n00:04:55.958 --> 00:04:57.958\nSo, most of the time they repel.\n\n00:04:57.958 --> 00:04:59.958\nYou get them closer and closer and closer and then at some point\n\n00:04:59.958 --> 00:05:02.958\nthe strong force grips them together.\n\n00:05:02.958 --> 00:05:04.958\nFor a moment they become helium 5,\n\n00:05:04.958 --> 00:05:06.958\nbecause they've got five particles inside them.\n\n00:05:06.958 --> 00:05:08.958\nSo, that's that process there. Deuterium and tritium goes together\n\n00:05:08.958 --> 00:05:10.958\nmakes helium 5.\n\n00:05:10.958 --> 00:05:13.958\nHelium splits out, and a neutron comes out\n\n00:05:13.958 --> 00:05:15.958\nand lots of energy comes out.\n\n00:05:15.958 --> 00:05:18.958\nIf you can get something to about 150 million degrees,\n\n00:05:18.958 --> 00:05:20.958\nthings will be rattling around so fast\n\n00:05:20.958 --> 00:05:24.958\nthat every time they collide in just the right configuration,\n\n00:05:24.958 --> 00:05:26.958\nthis will happen, and it will release energy.\n\n00:05:26.958 --> 00:05:30.958\nAnd that energy is what powers fusion.\n\n00:05:30.958 --> 00:05:33.958\nAnd it's this reaction that we want to do.\n\n00:05:33.958 --> 00:05:36.958\nThere is one trickiness about this reaction.\n\n00:05:36.958 --> 00:05:39.958\nWell, there is a trickiness that you have to make it 150 million degrees,\n\n00:05:39.958 --> 00:05:42.958\nbut there is a trickiness about the reaction yet.\n\n00:05:42.958 --> 00:05:44.958\nIt's pretty hot.\n\n00:05:44.958 --> 00:05:46.958\nThe trickiness about the reaction is that\n\n00:05:46.958 --> 00:05:48.958\ntritium doesn't exist in nature.\n\n00:05:48.958 --> 00:05:50.958\nYou have to make it from something else.\n\n00:05:50.958 --> 00:05:53.958\nAnd you make if from lithium. That reaction at the bottom,\n\n00:05:53.958 --> 00:05:57.958\nthat's lithium 6, plus a neutron,\n\n00:05:57.958 --> 00:05:59.958\nwill give you more helium, plus tritium.\n\n00:05:59.958 --> 00:06:01.958\nAnd that's the way you make your tritium.\n\n00:06:01.958 --> 00:06:04.958\nBut fortunately, if you can do this fusion reaction,\n\n00:06:04.958 --> 00:06:08.958\nyou've got a neutron, so you can make that happen.\n\n00:06:08.958 --> 00:06:11.958\nNow, why the hell would we bother to do this?\n\n00:06:11.958 --> 00:06:14.958\nThis is basically why we would bother to do it.\n\n00:06:14.958 --> 00:06:18.958\nIf you just plot how much fuel\n\n00:06:18.958 --> 00:06:20.958\nwe've got left, in units of\n\n00:06:20.958 --> 00:06:22.958\npresent world consumption.\n\n00:06:22.958 --> 00:06:25.958\nAnd as you go across there you see\n\n00:06:25.958 --> 00:06:27.958\na few tens of years of oil -- the blue line, by the way,\n\n00:06:27.958 --> 00:06:30.958\nis the lowest estimate of existing resources.\n\n00:06:30.958 --> 00:06:34.958\nAnd the yellow line is the most optimistic estimate.\n\n00:06:34.958 --> 00:06:36.958\nAnd as you go across there you will see\n\n00:06:36.958 --> 00:06:38.958\nthat we've got a few tens of years, and perhaps 100 years\n\n00:06:38.958 --> 00:06:41.958\nof fossil fuels left.\n\n00:06:41.958 --> 00:06:43.958\nAnd god knows we don't really want to burn all of it,\n\n00:06:43.958 --> 00:06:45.958\nbecause it will make an awful lot of carbon in the air.\n\n00:06:45.958 --> 00:06:48.958\nAnd then we get to uranium.\n\n00:06:48.958 --> 00:06:50.958\nAnd with current reactor technology\n\n00:06:50.958 --> 00:06:53.958\nwe really don't have very much uranium.\n\n00:06:53.958 --> 00:06:55.958\nAnd we will have to extract uranium from sea water,\n\n00:06:55.958 --> 00:06:57.958\nwhich is the yellow line,\n\n00:06:57.958 --> 00:07:00.958\nto make conventional nuclear power stations\n\n00:07:00.958 --> 00:07:02.958\nactually do very much for us.\n\n00:07:02.958 --> 00:07:04.958\nThis is a bit shocking, because in fact our government\n\n00:07:04.958 --> 00:07:07.958\nis relying on that for us to meet Kyoto,\n\n00:07:07.958 --> 00:07:09.958\nand do all those kind of things.\n\n00:07:09.958 --> 00:07:11.958\nTo go any further you would have to have breeder technology.\n\n00:07:11.958 --> 00:07:15.958\nAnd breeder technology is fast breeders. And that's pretty dangerous.\n\n00:07:15.958 --> 00:07:17.958\nThe big thing, on the right,\n\n00:07:17.958 --> 00:07:19.958\nis the lithium we have in the world.\n\n00:07:19.958 --> 00:07:22.958\nAnd lithium is in sea water. That's the yellow line.\n\n00:07:22.958 --> 00:07:26.958\nAnd we have 30 million years worth of fusion fuel in sea water.\n\n00:07:26.958 --> 00:07:29.958\nEverybody can get it. That's why we want to do fusion.\n\n00:07:29.958 --> 00:07:32.958\nIs it cost-competitive?\n\n00:07:32.958 --> 00:07:34.958\nWe make estimates of what we think it would cost\n\n00:07:34.958 --> 00:07:36.958\nto actually make a fusion power plant.\n\n00:07:36.958 --> 00:07:39.958\nAnd we get within about the same price\n\n00:07:39.958 --> 00:07:41.958\nas current electricity.\n\n00:07:41.958 --> 00:07:43.958\nSo, how would we make it?\n\n00:07:43.958 --> 00:07:46.958\nWe have to hold something at 150 million degrees.\n\n00:07:46.958 --> 00:07:49.958\nAnd, in fact, we've done this.\n\n00:07:49.958 --> 00:07:51.958\nWe hold it with a magnetic field.\n\n00:07:51.958 --> 00:07:56.958\nAnd inside it, right in the middle of this toroidal shape, doughnut shape,\n\n00:07:56.958 --> 00:07:58.958\nright in the middle is 150 million degrees.\n\n00:07:58.958 --> 00:08:02.958\nIt boils away in the middle at 150 million degrees.\n\n00:08:02.958 --> 00:08:04.958\nAnd in fact we can make fusion happen.\n\n00:08:04.958 --> 00:08:06.958\nAnd just down the road, this is JET.\n\n00:08:06.958 --> 00:08:08.958\nIt's the only machine in the world that's actually done fusion.\n\n00:08:08.958 --> 00:08:11.958\nWhen people say fusion is 30 years away, and always will be,\n\n00:08:11.958 --> 00:08:14.958\nI say, \"Yeah, but we've actually done it.\" Right?\n\n00:08:14.958 --> 00:08:16.958\nWe can do fusion. In the center of this device\n\n00:08:16.958 --> 00:08:19.958\nwe made 16 megawatts of fusion power in 1997.\n\n00:08:19.958 --> 00:08:22.958\nAnd in 2013 we're going to fire it up again\n\n00:08:22.958 --> 00:08:24.958\nand break all those records.\n\n00:08:24.958 --> 00:08:27.958\nBut that's not really fusion power. That's just making some fusion happen.\n\n00:08:27.958 --> 00:08:30.958\nWe've got to take that, we've got to make that into a fusion reactor.\n\n00:08:30.958 --> 00:08:35.958\nBecause we want 30 million years worth of fusion power for the Earth.\n\n00:08:35.958 --> 00:08:37.958\nThis is the device we're building now.\n\n00:08:37.958 --> 00:08:39.958\nIt gets very expensive to do this research.\n\n00:08:39.958 --> 00:08:41.958\nIt turns out you can't do fusion on a table top\n\n00:08:41.958 --> 00:08:44.958\ndespite all that cold fusion nonsense. Right?\n\n00:08:44.958 --> 00:08:47.958\nYou can't. You have to do it in a very big device.\n\n00:08:47.958 --> 00:08:50.958\nMore than half the world's population is involved in building this device\n\n00:08:50.958 --> 00:08:53.958\nin southern France, which is a nice place to put an experiment.\n\n00:08:53.958 --> 00:08:57.958\nSeven nations are involved in building this.\n\n00:08:57.958 --> 00:09:01.958\nIt's going to cost us 10 billion. And we'll produce half a gigawatt of fusion power.\n\n00:09:01.958 --> 00:09:04.958\nBut that's not electricity yet.\n\n00:09:04.958 --> 00:09:06.958\nWe have to get to this.\n\n00:09:06.958 --> 00:09:08.958\nWe have to get to a power plant.\n\n00:09:08.958 --> 00:09:10.958\nWe have to start putting electricity on the grid\n\n00:09:10.958 --> 00:09:12.958\nin this very complex technology.\n\n00:09:12.958 --> 00:09:15.958\nAnd I'd really like it to happen a lot faster than it is.\n\n00:09:15.958 --> 00:09:20.958\nBut at the moment, all we can imagine is sometime in the 2030s.\n\n00:09:20.958 --> 00:09:22.958\nI wish this were different. We really need it now.\n\n00:09:22.958 --> 00:09:24.958\nWe're going to have a problem with power\n\n00:09:24.958 --> 00:09:26.958\nin the next five years in this country.\n\n00:09:26.958 --> 00:09:30.958\nSo 2030 looks like an infinity away.\n\n00:09:30.958 --> 00:09:32.958\nBut we can't abandon it now; we have to push forward,\n\n00:09:32.958 --> 00:09:34.958\nget fusion to happen.\n\n00:09:34.958 --> 00:09:36.958\nI wish we had more money, I wish we had more resources.\n\n00:09:36.958 --> 00:09:38.958\nBut this is what we're aiming at,\n\n00:09:38.958 --> 00:09:40.958\nsometime in the 2030s --\n\n00:09:40.958 --> 00:09:42.958\nreal electric power from fusion. Thank you very much.\n\n00:09:42.958 --> 00:09:45.958\n(Applause)"}, {"title": "My message of peace from Pakistan", "duration": "268", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/asher_hasan_s_message_of_peace_from_pakistan", "transcript": "Namaste. Salaam. Shalom. Sat Sri Akal. Greetings to all of you from Pakistan. It is often said that we fear that which we do not know. And Pakistan, in this particular vein, is very similar. Because it has provoked, and does provoke, a visceral anxiety in the bellies of many a Western soul, especially when viewed through the monochromatic lens of turbulence and turmoil. But there are many other dimensions to Pakistan.And what follows is a stream of images, a series of images captured by some of Pakistan's most dynamic and young photographers, that aims to give you an alternative glimpse, a look inside the hearts and minds of some ordinary Pakistani citizens. Here are some of the stories they wanted us to share with you.My name is Abdul Khan. I come from Peshawar. I hope that you will be able to see not just my Taliban-like beard, but also the richness and color of my perceptions, aspirations and dreams, as rich and colorful as the satchels that I sell.My name is Meher and this is my friend Irim. I hope to become a vet when I grow up so that I can take care of stray cats and dogs who wander around the streets of the village that I live near Gilgit, northern Pakistan.My name is Kailash. And I like to enrich lives through technicolored glass. Madame, would you like some of those orange bangles with the pink polka dots?My name is Zamin. And I'm an IDP, an internally displaced person, from Swat. Do you see me on the other side of this fence? Do I matter, or really exist for you?My name is Iman. I am a fashion model, an up-and-coming model from Lahore. Do you see me simply smothered in cloth? Or can you move beyond my veil and see me for who I truly am inside?My name is Ahmed. I am an Afghan refugee from the Khyber agency. I have come from a place of intense darkness. And that is why I want to illuminate the world.My name is Papusay. My heart and drum beat as one. If religion is the opium of the masses, then for me, music is my one and only ganja.A rising tide lifts all boats. And the rising tide of India's spectacular economic growth has lifted over 400 million Indians into a buoyant middle class. But there are still over 650 million Indians, Pakistanis, Sri Lankans, Bangladeshis, Nepalese, who remain washed up on the shores of poverty.Therefore as India and Pakistan, as you and I, it behooves us to transcend our differences, to celebrate our diversity, to leverage our common humanity. Our collective vision at Naya Jeevan, which for many of you, as you all recognize, means \"new life\" in Urdu and Hindi, is to rejuvenate the lives of millions of low income families by providing them with affordable access to catastrophic health care. Indeed it is the emerging world's first HMO for the urban working poor.Why should we do this as Indians and Pakistanis? We are but two threads cut from the same cloth. And if our fates are intertwined, then we believe that it is good karma, it is good fortune. And for many of us, our fortunes do indeed lie at the bottom of the pyramid. Thank you. (Applause)Chris Anderson: Fantastic. Just stay up here. That was fantastic. I found that really moving. You know, we fought hard to get at least a small Pakistani contingent to come. It felt like it was really important. They went through a lot to get here. Would the Pakistanis please just stand up please? I just really wanted to acknowledge you.

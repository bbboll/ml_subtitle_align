You might think that these plants look dead, but they're not. Give them water, and they will resurrect, green up, start growing, in 12 to 48 hours.Now, why would I suggest that producing drought-tolerant crops will go towards providing food security? Well, the current world population is around 7 billion. And it's estimated that by 2050, we'll be between 9 and 10 billion people, with the bulk of this growth happening in Africa.The food and agricultural organizations of the world have suggested that we need a 70 percent increase in current agricultural practice to meet that demand. Given that plants are at the base of the food chain, most of that's going to have to come from plants.That percentage of 70 percent does not take into consideration the potential effects of climate change.This is taken from a study by Dai published in 2011, where he took into consideration all the potential effects of climate change and expressed them \u2014 amongst other things \u2014 increased aridity due to lack of rain or infrequent rain. The areas in red shown here, are areas that until recently have been very successfully used for agriculture, but cannot anymore because of lack of rainfall. This is the situation that's predicted to happen in 2050. Much of Africa, in fact, much of the world, is going to be in trouble. We're going to have to think of some very smart ways of producing food. And preferably among them, some drought-tolerant crops.The other thing to remember about Africa is that most of their agriculture is rainfed.Now, making drought-tolerant crops is not the easiest thing in the world. And the reason for this is water. Water is essential to life on this planet. All living, actively metabolizing organisms, from microbes to you and I, are comprised predominately of water. All life reactions happen in water. And loss of a small amount of water results in death. You and I are 65 percent water \u2014 we lose one percent of that, we die. But we can make behavioral changes to avoid that. Plants can't. They're stuck in the ground. And so in the first instance they have a little bit more water than us, about 95 percent water, and they can lose a little bit more than us, like 10 to about 70 percent, depending on the species, but for short periods only.Most of them will either try to resist or avoid water loss. So extreme examples of resistors can be found in succulents. They tend to be small, very attractive, but they hold onto their water at such great cost that they grow extremely slowly. Examples of avoidance of water loss are found in trees and shrubs. They send down very deep roots, mine subterranean water supplies and just keep flushing it through them at all times, keeping themselves hydrated.The one on the right is called a baobab. It's also called the upside-down tree, simply because the proportion of roots to shoots is so great that it looks like the tree has been planted upside down. And of course the roots are required for hydration of that plant.And probably the most common strategy of avoidance is found in annuals. Annuals make up the bulk of our plant food supplies. Up the west coast of my country, for much of the year you don't see much vegetation growth. But come the spring rains, you get this: flowering of the desert.The strategy in annuals, is to grow only in the rainy season. At the end of that season they produce a seed, which is dry, eight to 10 percent water, but very much alive. And anything that is that dry and still alive, we call desiccation-tolerant.In the desiccated state, what seeds can do is lie in extremes of environment for prolonged periods of time. The next time the rainy season comes, they germinate and grow, and the whole cycle just starts again.It's widely believed that the evolution of desiccation-tolerant seeds allowed the colonization and the radiation of flowering plants, or angiosperms, onto land.But back to annuals as our major form of food supplies. Wheat, rice and maize form 95 percent of our plant food supplies. And it's been a great strategy because in a short space of time you can produce a lot of seed. Seeds are energy-rich so there's a lot of food calories, you can store it in times of plenty for times of famine, but there's a downside. The vegetative tissues, the roots and leaves of annuals, do not have much by way of inherent resistance, avoidance or tolerance characteristics. They just don't need them. They grow in the rainy season and they've got a seed to help them survive the rest of the year.And so despite concerted efforts in agriculture to make crops with improved properties of resistance, avoidance and tolerance \u2014 particularly resistance and avoidance because we've had good models to understand how those work \u2014 we still get images like this. Maize crop in Africa, two weeks without rain and it's dead.There is a solution: resurrection plants. These plants can lose 95 percent of their cellular water, remain in a dry, dead-like state for months to years, and give them water, they green up and start growing again. Like seeds, these are desiccation-tolerant. Like seeds, these can withstand extremes of environmental conditions. And this is a really rare phenomenon. There are only 135 flowering plant species that can do this.I'm going to show you a video of the resurrection process of these three species in that order. And at the bottom, there's a time axis so you can see how quickly it happens.(Applause)Pretty amazing, huh?So I've spent the last 21 years trying to understand how they do this. How do these plants dry without dying? And I work on a variety of different resurrection plants, shown here in the hydrated and dry states, for a number of reasons.One of them is that each of these plants serves as a model for a crop that I'd like to make drought-tolerant.So on the extreme top left, for example, is a grass, it's called Eragrostis nindensis, it's got a close relative called Eragrostis tef \u2014 a lot of you might know it as \"teff\" \u2014 it's a staple food in Ethiopia, it's gluten-free, and it's something we would like to make drought-tolerant.The other reason for looking at a number of plants, is that, at least initially, I wanted to find out: do they do the same thing? Do they all use the same mechanisms to be able to lose all that water and not die?So I undertook what we call a systems biology approach in order to get a comprehensive understanding of desiccation tolerance, in which we look at everything from the molecular to the whole plant, ecophysiological level.For example we look at things like changes in the plant anatomy as they dried out and their ultrastructure. We look at the transcriptome, which is just a term for a technology in which we look at the genes that are switched on or off, in response to drying. Most genes will code for proteins, so we look at the proteome. What are the proteins made in response to drying? Some proteins would code for enzymes which make metabolites, so we look at the metabolome.Now, this is important because plants are stuck in the ground. They use what I call a highly tuned chemical arsenal to protect themselves from all the stresses of their environment. So it's important that we look at the chemical changes involved in drying.And at the last study that we do at the molecular level, we look at the lipidome \u2014 the lipid changes in response to drying. And that's also important because all biological membranes are made of lipids. They're held as membranes because they're in water. Take away the water, those membranes fall apart. Lipids also act as signals to turn on genes.Then we use physiological and biochemical studies to try and understand the function of the putative protectants that we've actually discovered in our other studies. And then use all of that to try and understand how the plant copes with its natural environment.I've always had the philosophy that I needed a comprehensive understanding of the mechanisms of desiccation tolerance in order to make a meaningful suggestion for a biotic application.I'm sure some of you are thinking, \"By biotic application, does she mean she's going to make genetically modified crops?\" And the answer to that question is: depends on your definition of genetic modification.All of the crops that we eat today, wheat, rice and maize, are highly genetically modified from their ancestors, but we don't consider them GM because they're being produced by conventional breeding. If you mean, am I going to put resurrection plant genes into crops, your answer is yes.In the essence of time, we have tried that approach. More appropriately, some of my collaborators at UCT, Jennifer Thomson, Suhail Rafudeen, have spearheaded that approach and I'm going to show you some data soon.But we're about to embark upon an extremely ambitious approach, in which we aim to turn on whole suites of genes that are already present in every crop. They're just never turned on under extreme drought conditions. I leave it up to you to decide whether those should be called GM or not.I'm going to now just give you some of the data from that first approach. And in order to do that I have to explain a little bit about how genes work.So you probably all know that genes are made of double-stranded DNA. It's wound very tightly into chromosomes that are present in every cell of your body or in a plant's body. If you unwind that DNA, you get genes. And each gene has a promoter, which is just an on-off switch, the gene coding region, and then a terminator, which indicates that this is the end of this gene, the next gene will start.Now, promoters are not simple on-off switches. They normally require a lot of fine-tuning, lots of things to be present and correct before that gene is switched on. So what's typically done in biotech studies is that we use an inducible promoter, we know how to switch it on. We couple that to genes of interest and put that into a plant and see how the plant responds.In the study that I'm going to talk to you about, my collaborators used a drought-induced promoter, which we discovered in a resurrection plant. The nice thing about this promoter is that we do nothing. The plant itself senses drought. And we've used it to drive antioxidant genes from resurrection plants. Why antioxidant genes? Well, all stresses, particularly drought stress, results in the formation of free radicals, or reactive oxygen species, which are highly damaging and can cause crop death. What antioxidants do is stop that damage.So here's some data from a maize strain that's very popularly used in Africa. To the left of the arrow are plants without the genes, to the right \u2014 plants with the antioxidant genes. After three weeks without watering, the ones with the genes do a hell of a lot better.Now to the final approach. My research has shown that there's considerable similarity in the mechanisms of desiccation tolerance in seeds and resurrection plants. So I ask the question, are they using the same genes? Or slightly differently phrased, are resurrection plants using genes evolved in seed desiccation tolerance in their roots and leaves? Have they retasked these seed genes in roots and leaves of resurrection plants?And I answer that question, as a consequence of a lot of research from my group and recent collaborations from a group of Henk Hilhorst in the Netherlands, Mel Oliver in the United States and Julia Buitink in France. The answer is yes, that there is a core set of genes that are involved in both.And I'm going to illustrate this very crudely for maize, where the chromosomes below the off switch represent all the genes that are required for desiccation tolerance. So as maize seeds dried out at the end of their period of development, they switch these genes on. Resurrection plants switch on the same genes when they dry out. All modern crops, therefore, have these genes in their roots and leaves, they just never switch them on. They only switch them on in seed tissues.So what we're trying to do right now is to understand the environmental and cellular signals that switch on these genes in resurrection plants, to mimic the process in crops.And just a final thought. What we're trying to do very rapidly is to repeat what nature did in the evolution of resurrection plants some 10 to 40 million years ago.My plants and I thank you for your attention.(Applause)",

desert.\n\n00:03:58.958 --> 00:04:00.814\nThe strategy in annuals,\n\n00:04:00.838 --> 00:04:03.198\nis to grow only in the rainy season.\n\n00:04:03.918 --> 00:04:06.214\nAt the end of that season\nthey produce a seed,\n\n00:04:06.238 --> 00:04:09.054\nwhich is dry, eight to 10 percent water,\n\n00:04:09.078 --> 00:04:10.734\nbut very much alive.\n\n00:04:10.758 --> 00:04:13.654\nAnd anything that is\nthat dry and still alive,\n\n00:04:13.678 --> 00:04:15.158\nwe call desiccation-tolerant.\n\n00:04:15.798 --> 00:04:17.214\nIn the desiccated state,\n\n00:04:17.238 -->

again.\n\n00:05:53.518 --> 00:05:56.814\nLike seeds, these are\ndesiccation-tolerant.\n\n00:05:56.838 --> 00:06:00.958\nLike seeds, these can withstand extremes\nof environmental conditions.\n\n00:06:01.718 --> 00:06:03.734\nAnd this is a really rare phenomenon.\n\n00:06:03.758 --> 00:06:08.134\nThere are only 135 flowering\nplant species that can do this.\n\n00:06:08.158 --> 00:06:09.574\nI'm going to show you a video\n\n00:06:09.598 --> 00:06:12.214\nof the resurrection process\nof these three species\n\n00:06:12.238 --> 00:06:13.454\nin that order.\n\n00:06:13.478 --> 00:06:14.734\nAnd at the bottom,\n\n00:06:14.758 --> 00:06:17.494\nthere's a time axis\nso you can see how quickly it happens.\n\n00:06:56.118 --> 00:06:58.158\n(Applause)\n\n00:07:02.198 --> 00:07:03.734\nPretty amazing, huh?\n\n00:07:03.758 --> 00:07:07.974\nSo I've spent the last 21 years\ntrying to understand how they do this.\n\n00:07:07.998 --> 00:07:10.398\nHow do these plants dry without dying?\n\n00:07:11.038 --> 00:07:13.814\nAnd I work on a variety\nof different resurrection plants,\n\n00:07:13.838 --> 00:07:16.254\nshown here in the hydrated and dry states,\n\n00:07:16.278 --> 00:07:17.734\nfor a number of reasons.\n\n00:07:17.758 --> 00:07:20.614\nOne of them is that each\nof these plants serves as a model\n\n00:07:20.638 --> 00:07:23.014\nfor a crop that I'd like\nto make drought-tolerant.\n\n00:07:23.038 --> 00:07:25.974\nSo on the extreme top left,\nfor example, is a grass,\n\n00:07:25.998 --> 00:07:28.254\nit's called Eragrostis nindensis,\n\n00:07:28.278 --> 00:07:30.654\nit's got a close relative\ncalled Eragrostis tef --\n\n00:07:30.678 --> 00:07:32.694\na lot of you might know it as \"teff\" --\n\n00:07:32.718 --> 00:07:34.454\nit's a staple food in Ethiopia,\n\n00:07:34.478 --> 00:07:35.734\nit's gluten-free,\n\n00:07:35.758 --> 00:07:38.774\nand it's something we would like\nto make drought-tolerant.\n\n00:07:38.798 --> 00:07:41.214\nThe other reason for looking\nat a number of plants,\n\n00:07:41.238 --> 00:07:42.614\nis that, at least initially,\n\n00:07:42.638 --> 00:07:44.894\nI wanted to find out:\ndo they do the same thing?\n\n00:07:44.918 --> 00:07:46.614\nDo they all use the same mechanisms\n\n00:07:46.638 --> 00:07:49.214\nto be able to lose\nall that water and not die?\n\n00:07:49.238 --> 00:07:51.934\nSo I undertook what we call\na systems biology approach\n\n00:07:51.958 --> 00:07:54.134\nin order to get\na comprehensive understanding\n\n00:07:54.158 --> 00:07:56.174\nof desiccation tolerance,\n\n00:07:56.198 --> 00:07:57.654\nin which we look at everything\n\n00:07:57.678 --> 00:08:00.590\nfrom the molecular to the whole plant,\necophysiological level.\n\n00:08:00.615 --> 00:08:02.249\nFor example we look at things like\n\n00:08:02.274 --> 00:08:04.471\nchanges in the plant anatomy\nas they dried out\n\n00:08:04.495 --> 00:08:05.734\nand their ultrastructure.\n\n00:08:05.758 --> 00:08:08.934\nWe look at the transcriptome,\nwhich is just a term for a technology\n\n00:08:08.958 --> 00:08:10.374\nin which we look at the genes\n\n00:08:10.398 --> 00:08:12.814\nthat are switched on or off,\nin response to drying.\n\n00:08:12.838 --> 00:08:16.054\nMost genes will code for proteins,\nso we look at the proteome.\n\n00:08:16.078 --> 00:08:18.478\nWhat are the proteins made\nin response to drying?\n\n00:08:19.438 --> 00:08:23.334\nSome proteins would code for enzymes\nwhich make metabolites,\n\n00:08:23.358 --> 00:08:24.934\nso we look at the metabolome.\n\n00:08:24.958 --> 00:08:28.254\nNow, this is important\nbecause plants are stuck in the ground.\n\n00:08:28.278 --> 00:08:32.374\nThey use what I call\na highly tuned chemical arsenal\n\n00:08:32.398 --> 00:08:35.814\nto protect themselves from all\nthe stresses of their environment.\n\n00:08:35.838 --> 00:08:37.334\nSo it's important that we look\n\n00:08:37.358 --> 00:08:39.798\nat the chemical changes\ninvolved in drying.\n\n00:08:40.478 --> 00:08:43.134\nAnd at the last study\nthat we do at the molecular level,\n\n00:08:43.158 --> 00:08:44.414\nwe look at the lipidome --\n\n00:08:44.438 --> 00:08:46.493\nthe lipid changes in response to drying.\n\n00:08:46.517 --> 00:08:47.774\nAnd that's also important\n\n00:08:47.798 --> 00:08:50.613\nbecause all biological membranes\nare made of lipids.\n\n00:08:50.637 --> 00:08:53.214\nThey're held as membranes\nbecause they're in water.\n\n00:08:53.238 --> 00:08:55.478\nTake away the water,\nthose membranes fall apart.\n\n00:08:56.198 --> 00:08:59.238\nLipids also act as signals\nto turn on genes.\n\n00:09:00.158 --> 00:09:02.854\nThen we use physiological\nand biochemical studies\n\n00:09:02.878 --> 00:09:06.094\nto try and understand\nthe function of the putative protectants\n\n00:09:06.118 --> 00:09:09.054\nthat we've actually discovered\nin our other studies.\n\n00:09:09.078 --> 00:09:11.254\nAnd then use all of that\nto try and understand\n\n00:09:11.278 --> 00:09:13.598\nhow the plant copes\nwith its natural environment.\n\n00:09:15.438 --> 00:09:19.774\nI've always had the philosophy that\nI needed a comprehensive understanding\n\n00:09:19.798 --> 00:09:22.054\nof the mechanisms of desiccation tolerance\n\n00:09:22.078 --> 00:09:25.918\nin order to make a meaningful suggestion\nfor a biotic application.\n\n00:09:26.958 --> 00:09:28.614\nI'm sure some of you are thinking,\n\n00:09:28.638 --> 00:09:29.894\n\"By biotic application,\n\n00:09:29.918 --> 00:09:32.838\ndoes she mean she's going to make\ngenetically modified crops?\"\n\n00:09:34.198 --> 00:09:35.894\nAnd the answer to that question is:\n\n00:09:35.918 --> 00:09:38.299\ndepends on your definition\nof genetic modification.\n\n00:09:39.158 --> 00:09:41.974\nAll of the crops that we eat today,\nwheat, rice and maize,\n\n00:09:41.998 --> 00:09:45.214\nare highly genetically modified\nfrom their ancestors,\n\n00:09:45.238 --> 00:09:47.214\nbut we don't consider them GM\n\n00:09:47.238 --> 00:09:49.878\nbecause they're being produced\nby conventional breeding.\n\n00:09:50.838 --> 00:09:54.614\nIf you mean, am I going to put\nresurrection plant genes into crops,\n\n00:09:54.638 --> 00:09:55.934\nyour answer is yes.\n\n00:09:55.958 --> 00:09:59.094\nIn the essence of time,\nwe have tried that approach.\n\n00:09:59.118 --> 00:10:01.974\nMore appropriately,\nsome of my collaborators at UCT,\n\n00:10:01.998 --> 00:10:03.934\nJennifer Thomson, Suhail Rafudeen,\n\n00:10:03.958 --> 00:10:05.574\nhave spearheaded that approach\n\n00:10:05.598 --> 00:10:07.551\nand I'm going to show you some data soon.\n\n00:10:09.158 --> 00:10:13.174\nBut we're about to embark\nupon an extremely ambitious approach,\n\n00:10:13.198 --> 00:10:16.654\nin which we aim to turn on\nwhole suites of genes\n\n00:10:16.678 --> 00:10:19.374\nthat are already present in every crop.\n\n00:10:19.398 --> 00:10:22.303\nThey're just never turned on\nunder extreme drought conditions.\n\n00:10:22.758 --> 00:10:24.214\nI leave it up to you to decide\n\n00:10:24.238 --> 00:10:26.191\nwhether those should be called GM or not.\n\n00:10:27.518 --> 00:10:30.974\nI'm going to now just give you\nsome of the data from that first approach.\n\n00:10:30.998 --> 00:10:32.254\nAnd in order to do that\n\n00:10:32.278 --> 00:10:34.934\nI have to explain a little bit\nabout how genes work.\n\n00:10:34.958 --> 00:10:36.214\nSo you probably all know\n\n00:10:36.238 --> 00:10:38.294\nthat genes are made\nof double-stranded DNA.\n\n00:10:38.318 --> 00:10:40.254\nIt's wound very tightly into chromosomes\n\n00:10:40.278 --> 00:10:43.438\nthat are present in every cell\nof your body or in a plant's body.\n\n00:10:44.038 --> 00:10:47.118\nIf you unwind that DNA, you get genes.\n\n00:10:47.798 --> 00:10:50.254\nAnd each gene has a promoter,\n\n00:10:50.278 --> 00:10:52.654\nwhich is just an on-off switch,\n\n00:10:52.678 --> 00:10:54.094\nthe gene coding region,\n\n00:10:54.118 --> 00:10:55.374\nand then a terminator,\n\n00:10:55.398 --> 00:10:58.998\nwhich indicates that this is the end\nof this gene, the next gene will start.\n\n00:10:59.678 --> 00:11:02.574\nNow, promoters are not\nsimple on-off switches.\n\n00:11:02.598 --> 00:11:05.294\nThey normally require\na lot of fine-tuning,\n\n00:11:05.318 --> 00:11:09.358\nlots of things to be present and correct\nbefore that gene is switched on.\n\n00:11:10.198 --> 00:11:13.254\nSo what's typically done\nin biotech studies\n\n00:11:13.278 --> 00:11:15.094\nis that we use an inducible promoter,\n\n00:11:15.118 --> 00:11:16.694\nwe know how to switch it on.\n\n00:11:16.718 --> 00:11:18.734\nWe couple that to genes of interest\n\n00:11:18.758 --> 00:11:21.438\nand put that into a plant\nand see how the plant responds.\n\n00:11:22.078 --> 00:11:24.654\nIn the study that I'm going\nto talk to you about,\n\n00:11:24.678 --> 00:11:27.134\nmy collaborators used\na drought-induced promoter,\n\n00:11:27.158 --> 00:11:29.574\nwhich we discovered\nin a resurrection plant.\n\n00:11:29.598 --> 00:11:32.734\nThe nice thing about this promoter\nis that we do nothing.\n\n00:11:32.758 --> 00:11:34.838\nThe plant itself senses drought.\n\n00:11:35.558 --> 00:11:40.654\nAnd we've used it to drive antioxidant\ngenes from resurrection plants.\n\n00:11:40.678 --> 00:11:42.534\nWhy antioxidant genes?\n\n00:11:42.558 --> 00:11:45.614\nWell, all stresses,\nparticularly drought stress,\n\n00:11:45.638 --> 00:11:47.934\nresults in the formation of free radicals,\n\n00:11:47.958 --> 00:11:50.294\nor reactive oxygen species,\n\n00:11:50.318 --> 00:11:53.038\nwhich are highly damaging\nand can cause crop death.\n\n00:11:53.638 --> 00:11:56.238\nWhat antioxidants do is stop that damage.\n\n00:11:57.318 --> 00:12:01.214\nSo here's some data from a maize strain\nthat's very popularly used in Africa.\n\n00:12:01.238 --> 00:12:04.534\nTo the left of the arrow\nare plants without the genes,\n\n00:12:04.558 --> 00:12:05.814\nto the right --\n\n00:12:05.838 --> 00:12:07.894\nplants with the antioxidant genes.\n\n00:12:07.918 --> 00:12:09.734\nAfter three weeks without watering,\n\n00:12:09.758 --> 00:12:12.238\nthe ones with the genes\ndo a hell of a lot better.\n\n00:12:13.678 --> 00:12:15.014\nNow to the final approach.\n\n00:12:15.038 --> 00:12:18.574\nMy research has shown\nthat there's considerable similarity\n\n00:12:18.598 --> 00:12:23.014\nin the mechanisms of desiccation tolerance\nin seeds and resurrection plants.\n\n00:12:23.038 --> 00:12:24.454\nSo I ask the question,\n\n00:12:24.478 --> 00:12:25.918\nare they using the same genes?\n\n00:12:26.438 --> 00:12:28.694\nOr slightly differently phrased,\n\n00:12:28.718 --> 00:12:33.214\nare resurrection plants using genes\nevolved in seed desiccation tolerance\n\n00:12:33.238 --> 00:12:34.494\nin their roots and leaves?\n\n00:12:34.518 --> 00:12:36.574\nHave they retasked these seed genes\n\n00:12:36.598 --> 00:12:38.638\nin roots and leaves\nof resurrection plants?\n\n00:12:39.718 --> 00:12:41.574\nAnd I answer that question,\n\n00:12:41.598 --> 00:12:44.014\nas a consequence of a lot\nof research from my group\n\n00:12:44.038 --> 00:12:47.574\nand recent collaborations from a group\nof Henk Hilhorst in the Netherlands,\n\n00:12:47.598 --> 00:12:49.174\nMel Oliver in the United States\n\n00:12:49.198 --> 00:12:51.798\nand Julia Buitink in France.\n\n00:12:51.838 --> 00:12:53.254\nThe answer is yes,\n\n00:12:53.278 --> 00:12:56.134\nthat there is a core set of genes\nthat are involved in both.\n\n00:12:56.158 --> 00:12:59.574\nAnd I'm going to illustrate this\nvery crudely for maize,\n\n00:12:59.598 --> 00:13:02.014\nwhere the chromosomes below the off switch\n\n00:13:02.038 --> 00:13:05.613\nrepresent all the genes that are required\nfor desiccation tolerance.\n\n00:13:05.638 --> 00:13:09.894\nSo as maize seeds dried out\nat the end of their period of development,\n\n00:13:09.918 --> 00:13:11.278\nthey switch these genes on.\n\n00:13:12.638 --> 00:13:15.534\nResurrection plants\nswitch on the same genes\n\n00:13:15.558 --> 00:13:17.214\nwhen they dry out.\n\n00:13:17.238 --> 00:13:19.014\nAll modern crops, therefore,\n\n00:13:19.038 --> 00:13:21.094\nhave these genes\nin their roots and leaves,\n\n00:13:21.118 --> 00:13:22.854\nthey just never switch them on.\n\n00:13:22.878 --> 00:13:24.838\nThey only switch them on in seed tissues.\n\n00:13:25.398 --> 00:13:27.134\nSo what we're trying to do right now\n\n00:13:27.158 --> 00:13:29.774\nis to understand the environmental\nand cellular signals\n\n00:13:29.798 --> 00:13:32.238\nthat switch on these genes\nin resurrection plants,\n\n00:13:33.238 --> 00:13:34.998\nto mimic the process in crops.\n\n00:13:35.638 --> 00:13:37.374\nAnd just a final thought.\n\n00:13:37.398 --> 00:13:39.614\nWhat we're trying to do very rapidly\n\n00:13:39.638 --> 00:13:43.454\nis to repeat what nature did\nin the evolution of resurrection plants\n\n00:13:43.478 --> 00:13:45.318\nsome 10 to 40 million years ago.\n\n00:13:46.118 --> 00:13:48.614\nMy plants and I thank you\nfor your attention.\n\n00:13:48.638 --> 00:13:54.873\n(Applause)"}, {"title": "Can a computer write poetry?", "duration": "656", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/oscar_schwartz_can_a_computer_write_poetry", "transcript": "I have a question. Can a computer write poetry? This is a provocative question. You think about it for a minute, and you suddenly have a bunch of other questions like: What is a computer? What is poetry? What is creativity? But these are questions that people spend their entire lifetime trying to answer, not in a single TED Talk. So we're going to have to try a different approach.So up here, we have two poems. One of them is written by a human, and the other one's written by a computer. I'm going to ask you to tell me which one's which. Have a go:Poem 1: Little Fly / Thy summer's play, / My thoughtless hand / Has brush'd away. Am I not / A fly like thee? / Or art not thou / A man like me?Poem 2: We can feel / Activist through your life's / morning / Pauses to see, pope I hate the / Non all the night to start a / great otherwise (...)Alright, time's up. Hands up if you think Poem 1 was written by a human. OK, most of you. Hands up if you think Poem 2 was written by a human. Very brave of you, because the first one was written by the human poet William Blake. The second one was written by an algorithm that took all the language from my Facebook feed on one day and then regenerated it algorithmically, according to methods that I'll describe a little bit later on. So let's try another test. Again, you haven't got ages to read this, so just trust your gut.Poem 1: A lion roars and a dog barks. It is interesting / and fascinating that a bird will fly and not / roar or bark. Enthralling stories about animals are in my dreams and I will sing them all if I / am not exhausted or weary.Poem 2: Oh! kangaroos, sequins, chocolate sodas! / You are really beautiful! Pearls, / harmonicas, jujubes, aspirins! All / the stuff they've always talked about (...)Alright, time's up. So if you think the first poem was written by a human, put your hand up. OK. And if you think the second poem was written by a human, put your hand up. We have, more or less, a 50/50 split here. It was much harder.The answer is, the first poem was generated by an algorithm called Racter, that was created back in the 1970s, and the second poem was written by a guy called Frank O'Hara, who happens to be one of my favorite human poets.(Laughter)So what we've just done now is a Turing test for poetry. The Turing test was first proposed by this guy, Alan Turing, in 1950, in order to answer the question, can computers think? Alan Turing believed that if a computer was able to have a to have a text-based conversation with a human, with such proficiency such that the human couldn't tell whether they are talking to a computer or a human, then the computer can be said to have intelligence.So in 2013, my friend Benjamin Laird and I, we created a Turing test for poetry online. It's called bot or not, and you can go and play it for yourselves. But basically, it's the game we just played. You're presented with a poem, you don't know whether it was written by a human or a computer and you have to guess. So thousands and thousands of people have taken this test online, so we have results.And what are the results? Well, Turing said that if a computer could fool a human 30 percent of the time that it was a human, then it passes the Turing test for intelligence. We have poems on the bot or not database that have fooled 65 percent of human readers into thinking it was written by a human. So, I think we have an answer to our question. According to the logic of the Turing test, can a computer write poetry? Well, yes, absolutely it can. But if you're feeling a little bit uncomfortable with this answer, that's OK. If you're having a bunch of gut reactions to it, that's also OK because this isn't the end of the story.Let's play our third and final test. Again, you're going to have to read and tell me which you think is human.Poem 1: Red flags the reason for pretty flags. / And ribbons. Ribbons of flags / And wearing material / Reasons for wearing material. (...)Poem 2: A wounded deer leaps highest, / I've heard the daffodil I've heard the flag to-day / I've heard the hunter tell; / 'Tis but the ecstasy of death, / And then the brake is almost done (...)OK, time is up. So hands up if you think Poem 1 was written by a human. Hands up if you think Poem 2 was written by a human. Whoa, that's a lot more people. So you'd be surprised to find that Poem 1 was written by the very human poet Gertrude Stein. And Poem 2 was generated by an algorithm called RKCP. Now before we go on, let me describe very quickly and simply, how RKCP works. So RKCP is an algorithm designed by Ray Kurzweil, who's a director of engineering at Google and a firm believer in artificial intelligence. So, you give RKCP a source text, it analyzes the source text in order to find out how it uses language, and then it regenerates language that emulates that first text.So in the poem we just saw before, Poem 2, the one that you all thought was human, it was fed a bunch of poems by a poet called Emily Dickinson it looked at the way she used language, learned the model, and then it regenerated a model according to that same structure. But the important thing to know about RKCP is that it doesn't know the meaning of the words it's using. The language is just raw material, it could be Chinese, it could be in Swedish, it could be the collected language from your Facebook feed for one day. It's just raw material. And nevertheless, it's able to create a poem that seems more human than Gertrude Stein's poem, and Gertrude Stein is a human.So what we've done here is, more or less, a reverse Turing test. So Gertrude Stein, who's a human, is able to write a poem that fools a majority of human judges into thinking that it was written by a computer. Therefore, according to the logic of the reverse Turing test, Gertrude Stein is a computer.(Laughter)Feeling confused? I think that's fair enough.So far we've had humans that write like humans, we have computers that write like computers, we have computers that write like humans, but we also have, perhaps most confusingly, humans that write like computers.So what do we take from all of this? Do we take that William Blake is somehow more of a human than Gertrude Stein? Or that Gertrude Stein is more of a computer than William Blake?(Laughter)These are questions I've been asking myself for around two years now, and I don't have any answers. But what I do have are a bunch of insights about our relationship with technology.So my first insight is that, for some reason, we associate poetry with being human. So that when we ask, \"Can a computer write poetry?\" we're also asking, \"What does it mean to be human and how do we put boundaries around this category? How do we say who or what can be part of this category?\" This is an essentially philosophical question, I believe, and it can't be answered with a yes or no test, like the Turing test. I also believe that Alan Turing understood this, and that when he devised his test back in 1950, he was doing it as a philosophical provocation.So my second insight is that, when we take the Turing test for poetry, we're not really testing the capacity of the computers because poetry-generating algorithms, they're pretty simple and have existed, more or less, since the 1950s. What we are doing with the Turing test for poetry, rather, is collecting opinions about what constitutes humanness. So, what I've figured out, we've seen this when earlier today, we say that William Blake is more of a human than Gertrude Stein. Of course, this doesn't mean that William Blake was actually more human or that Gertrude Stein was more of a computer. It simply means that the category of the human is unstable. This has led me to understand that the human is not a cold, hard fact. Rather, it is something that's constructed with our opinions and something that changes over time.So my final insight is that the computer, more or less, works like a mirror that reflects any idea of a human that we show it. We show it Emily Dickinson, it gives Emily Dickinson back to us. We show it William Blake, that's what it reflects back to us. We show it Gertrude Stein, what we get back is Gertrude Stein. More than any other bit of technology, the computer is a mirror that reflects any idea of the human we teach it.So I'm sure a lot of you have been hearing a lot about artificial intelligence recently. And much of the conversation is, can we build it? Can we build an intelligent computer? Can we build a creative computer? What we seem to be asking over and over is can we build a human-like computer?But what we've seen just now is that the human is not a scientific fact, that it's an ever-shifting, concatenating idea and one that changes over time. So that when we begin to grapple with the ideas of artificial intelligence in the future, we shouldn't only be asking ourselves, \"Can we build it?\" But we should also be asking ourselves, \"What idea of the human do we want to have reflected back to us?\" This is an essentially philosophical idea, and it's one that can't be answered with software alone, but I think requires a moment of species-wide, existential reflection.Thank you.(Applause)", "id": 2411, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:12.839 --> 00:00:14.069\nI have a question.\n\n00:00:15.380 --> 00:00:17.323\nCan a computer write poetry?\n\n00:00:18.917 --> 00:00:20.994\nThis is a provocative question.\n\n00:00:21.673 --> 00:00:23.391\nYou think about it for a minute,\n\n00:00:23.415 --> 00:00:26.005\nand you suddenly have a bunch\nof other questions like:\n\n00:00:26.727 --> 00:00:28.108\nWhat is a computer?\n\n00:00:28.668 --> 00:00:30.243\nWhat is poetry?\n\n00:00:30.665 --> 00:00:32.354\nWhat is creativity?\n\n00:00:33.608 --> 00:00:34.780\nBut these are questions\n\n00:00:34.804 --> 00:00:37.874\nthat people spend their entire\nlifetime trying to answer,\n\n00:00:37.898 --> 00:00:40.122\nnot in a single TED Talk.\n\n00:00:40.146 --> 00:00:42.591\nSo we're going to have to try\na different approach.\n\n00:00:42.615 --> 00:00:44.758\nSo up here, we have two poems.\n\n00:00:45.797 --> 00:00:48.073\nOne of them is written by a human,\n\n00:00:48.097 --> 00:00:50.199\nand the other one's written by a computer.\n\n00:00:50.712 --> 00:00:53.122\nI'm going to ask you to tell me\nwhich one's which.\n\n00:00:53.816 --> 00:00:54.972\nHave a go:\n\n00:00:54.996 --> 00:00:59.052\nPoem 1: Little Fly / Thy summer's play, /\nMy thoughtless hand / Has brush'd away.\n\n00:00:59.076 --> 00:01:02.470\nAm I not / A fly like thee? /\nOr art not thou / A man like me?\n\n00:01:02.494 --> 00:01:05.793\nPoem 2: We can feel / Activist\nthrough your life's / morning /\n\n00:01:05.817 --> 00:01:10.064\nPauses to see, pope I hate the / Non\nall the night to start a / great otherwise (...)\n\n00:01:10.088 --> 00:01:11.447\nAlright, time's up.\n\n00:01:11.471 --> 00:01:15.567\nHands up if you think Poem 1\nwas written by a human.\n\n00:01:17.505 --> 00:01:18.995\nOK, most of you.\n\n00:01:19.019 --> 00:01:22.042\nHands up if you think Poem 2\nwas written by a human.\n\n00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:24.320\nVery brave of you,\n\n00:01:24.813 --> 00:01:29.098\nbecause the first one was written\nby the human poet William Blake.\n\n00:01:29.742 --> 00:01:32.691\nThe second one was written by an algorithm\n\n00:01:32.715 --> 00:01:36.407\nthat took all the language\nfrom my Facebook feed on one day\n\n00:01:36.431 --> 00:01:39.194\nand then regenerated it algorithmically,\n\n00:01:39.218 --> 00:01:42.808\naccording to methods that I'll describe\na little bit later on.\n\n00:01:43.176 --> 00:01:45.580\nSo let's try another test.\n\n00:01:46.356 --> 00:01:48.449\nAgain, you haven't got ages to read this,\n\n00:01:48.473 --> 00:01:50.085\nso just trust your gut.\n\n00:01:50.109 --> 00:01:54.154\nPoem 1: A lion roars and a dog barks.\nIt is interesting / and fascinating\n\n00:01:54.178 --> 00:01:58.481\nthat a bird will fly and not / roar\nor bark.

hands up if you think Poem 1\nwas written by a human.\n\n00:04:51.931 --> 00:04:54.969\nHands up if you think Poem 2\nwas written by a human.\n\n00:04:54.993 --> 00:04:57.324\nWhoa, that's a lot more people.\n\n00:04:58.285 --> 00:05:01.253\nSo you'd be surprised to find that Poem 1\n\n00:05:01.277 --> 00:05:05.270\nwas written by the very\nhuman poet Gertrude Stein.\n\n00:05:06.058 --> 00:05:11.096\nAnd Poem 2 was generated\nby an algorithm called RKCP.\n\n00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:14.439\nNow before we go on, let me describe\nvery quickly and simply,\n\n00:05:14.463 --> 00:05:16.244\nhow RKCP works.\n\n00:05:16.831 --> 00:05:20.681\nSo RKCP is an algorithm\ndesigned by Ray Kurzweil,\n\n00:05:20.705 --> 00:05:22.927\nwho's a director of engineering at Google\n\n00:05:22.951 --> 00:05:25.311\nand a firm believer\nin artificial intelligence.\n\n00:05:25.780 --> 00:05:29.771\nSo, you give RKCP a source text,\n\n00:05:29.795 --> 00:05:34.264\nit analyzes the source text in order\nto find out how it uses language,\n\n00:05:34.288 --> 00:05:36.236\nand then it regenerates language\n\n00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:38.788\nthat emulates that first text.\n\n00:05:38.812 --> 00:05:40.925\nSo in the poem we just saw before,\n\n00:05:40.949 --> 00:05:43.574\nPoem 2, the one that you all\nthought was human,\n\n00:05:43.598 --> 00:05:45.148\nit was fed a bunch of poems\n\n00:05:45.172 --> 00:05:47.207\nby a poet called Emily Dickinson\n\n00:05:47.231 --> 00:05:49.420\nit looked at the way she used language,\n\n00:05:49.444 --> 00:05:50.609\nlearned the model,\n\n00:05:50.633 --> 00:05:54.891\nand then it regenerated a model\naccording to that same structure.\n\n00:05:56.690 --> 00:05:58.868\nBut the important thing to know about RKCP\n\n00:05:58.892 --> 00:06:01.730\nis that it doesn't know the meaning\nof the words it's using.\n\n00:06:02.317 --> 00:06:04.593\nThe language is just raw material,\n\n00:06:04.617 --> 00:06:06.777\nit could be Chinese,\nit could be in Swedish,\n\n00:06:06.801 --> 00:06:10.980\nit could be the collected language\nfrom your Facebook feed for one day.\n\n00:06:11.004 --> 00:06:12.656\nIt's just raw material.\n\n00:06:13.338 --> 00:06:16.035\nAnd nevertheless, it's able\nto create a poem\n\n00:06:16.059 --> 00:06:19.386\nthat seems more human\nthan Gertrude Stein's poem,\n\n00:06:19.410 --> 00:06:21.563\nand Gertrude Stein is a human.\n\n00:06:22.804 --> 00:06:26.876\nSo what we've done here is,\nmore or less, a reverse Turing test.\n\n00:06:27.898 --> 00:06:33.077\nSo Gertrude Stein, who's a human,\nis able to write a poem\n\n00:06:33.101 --> 00:06:36.839\nthat fools a majority\nof human judges into thinking\n\n00:06:36.863 --> 00:06:38.689\nthat it was written by a computer.\n\n00:06:39.134 --> 00:06:43.275\nTherefore, according to the logic\nof the reverse Turing test,\n\n00:06:43.299 --> 00:06:45.215\nGertrude Stein is a computer.\n\n00:06:45.239 --> 00:06:46.701\n(Laughter)\n\n00:06:47.316 --> 00:06:48.610\nFeeling confused?\n\n00:06:49.151 --> 00:06:50.666\nI think that's fair enough.\n\n00:06:51.504 --> 00:06:55.620\nSo far we've had humans\nthat write like humans,\n\n00:06:55.644 --> 00:06:58.755\nwe have computers that write\nlike computers,\n\n00:06:58.779 --> 00:07:01.834\nwe have computers that write like humans,\n\n00:07:01.858 --> 00:07:05.490\nbut we also have,\nperhaps most confusingly,\n\n00:07:05.514 --> 00:07:07.889\nhumans that write like computers.\n\n00:07:08.896 --> 00:07:10.662\nSo what do we take from all of this?\n\n00:07:11.569 --> 00:07:14.726\nDo we take that William Blake\nis somehow more of a human\n\n00:07:14.750 --> 00:07:15.999\nthan Gertrude Stein?\n\n00:07:16.023 --> 00:07:19.069\nOr that Gertrude Stein is more\nof a computer than William Blake?\n\n00:07:19.093 --> 00:07:20.645\n(Laughter)\n\n00:07:20.669 --> 00:07:22.992\nThese are questions\nI've been asking myself\n\n00:07:23.016 --> 00:07:24.481\nfor around two years now,\n\n00:07:24.505 --> 00:07:26.814\nand I don't have any answers.\n\n00:07:26.838 --> 00:07:29.168\nBut what I do have are a bunch of insights\n\n00:07:29.192 --> 00:07:31.726\nabout our relationship with technology.\n\n00:07:32.957 --> 00:07:36.566\nSo my first insight is that,\nfor some reason,\n\n00:07:36.590 --> 00:07:39.701\nwe associate poetry with being human.\n\n00:07:40.155 --> 00:07:43.870\nSo that when we ask,\n\"Can a computer write poetry?\"\n\n00:07:43.894 --> 00:07:45.087\nwe're also asking,\n\n00:07:45.111 --> 00:07:46.909\n\"What does it mean to be human\n\n00:07:46.933 --> 00:07:50.105\nand how do we put boundaries\naround this category?\n\n00:07:50.129 --> 00:07:53.787\nHow do we say who or what\ncan be part of this category?\"\n\n00:07:54.334 --> 00:07:57.685\nThis is an essentially\nphilosophical question, I believe,\n\n00:07:57.709 --> 00:07:59.938\nand it can't be answered\nwith a yes or no test,\n\n00:07:59.962 --> 00:08:01.289\nlike the Turing test.\n\n00:08:01.763 --> 00:08:04.808\nI also believe that Alan Turing\nunderstood this,\n\n00:08:04.832 --> 00:08:08.137\nand that when he devised\nhis test back in 1950,\n\n00:08:08.161 --> 00:08:10.963\nhe was doing it\nas a philosophical provocation.\n\n00:08:13.082 --> 00:08:18.623\nSo my second insight is that,\nwhen we take the Turing test for poetry,\n\n00:08:18.647 --> 00:08:22.107\nwe're not really testing\nthe capacity of the computers\n\n00:08:22.131 --> 00:08:25.024\nbecause poetry-generating algorithms,\n\n00:08:25.048 --> 00:08:29.611\nthey're pretty simple and have existed,\nmore or less, since the 1950s.\n\n00:08:31.013 --> 00:08:34.131\nWhat we are doing with the Turing\ntest for poetry, rather,\n\n00:08:34.155 --> 00:08:38.770\nis collecting opinions about what\nconstitutes humanness.\n\n00:08:40.271 --> 00:08:43.000\nSo, what I've figured out,\n\n00:08:43.024 --> 00:08:45.996\nwe've seen this when earlier today,\n\n00:08:46.020 --> 00:08:48.498\nwe say that William Blake\nis more of a human\n\n00:08:48.522 --> 00:08:50.087\nthan Gertrude Stein.\n\n00:08:50.111 --> 00:08:52.573\nOf course, this doesn't mean\nthat William Blake\n\n00:08:52.597 --> 00:08:54.425\nwas actually more human\n\n00:08:54.449 --> 00:08:56.776\nor that Gertrude Stein\nwas more of a computer.\n\n00:08:57.491 --> 00:09:02.205\nIt simply means that the category\nof the human is unstable.\n\n00:09:03.408 --> 00:09:05.482\nThis has led me to understand\n\n00:09:05.506 --> 00:09:08.269\nthat the human is not a cold, hard fact.\n\n00:09:08.790 --> 00:09:11.922\nRather, it is something\nthat's constructed with our opinions\n\n00:09:11.946 --> 00:09:14.801\nand something that changes over time.\n\n00:09:16.629 --> 00:09:21.108\nSo my final insight is that\nthe computer, more or less,\n\n00:09:21.132 --> 00:09:25.138\nworks like a mirror\nthat reflects any idea of a human\n\n00:09:25.162 --> 00:09:26.537\nthat we show it.\n\n00:09:26.916 --> 00:09:28.800\nWe show it Emily Dickinson,\n\n00:09:28.824 --> 00:09:31.145\nit gives Emily Dickinson back to us.\n\n00:09:31.726 --> 00:09:33.560\nWe show it William Blake,\n\n00:09:33.584 --> 00:09:35.869\nthat's what it reflects back to us.\n\n00:09:35.893 --> 00:09:37.732\nWe show it Gertrude Stein,\n\n00:09:37.756 --> 00:09:40.226\nwhat we get back is Gertrude Stein.\n\n00:09:41.041 --> 00:09:43.409\nMore than any other bit of technology,\n\n00:09:43.433 --> 00:09:48.598\nthe computer is a mirror that reflects\nany idea of the human we teach it.\n\n00:09:50.019 --> 00:09:52.306\nSo I'm sure a lot of you have been hearing\n\n00:09:52.330 --> 00:09:55.192\na lot about artificial\nintelligence recently.\n\n00:09:56.652 --> 00:09:59.482\nAnd much of the conversation is,\n\n00:10:00.250 --> 00:10:01.439\ncan we build it?\n\n00:10:02.341 --> 00:10:05.476\nCan we build an intelligent computer?\n\n00:10:05.500 --> 00:10:08.263\nCan we build a creative computer?\n\n00:10:08.287 --> 00:10:10.400\nWhat we seem to be asking over and over\n\n00:10:10.424 --> 00:10:13.148\nis can we build a human-like computer?\n\n00:10:13.919 --> 00:10:15.475\nBut what we've seen just now\n\n00:10:15.499 --> 00:10:18.587\nis that the human\nis not a scientific fact,\n\n00:10:18.611 --> 00:10:22.141\nthat it's an ever-shifting,\nconcatenating idea\n\n00:10:22.165 --> 00:10:24.696\nand one that changes over time.\n\n00:10:24.720 --> 00:10:27.872\nSo that when we begin\nto grapple with the ideas\n\n00:10:27.896 --> 00:10:30.282\nof artificial intelligence in the future,\n\n00:10:30.306 --> 00:10:32.211\nwe shouldn't only be asking ourselves,\n\n00:10:32.235 --> 00:10:33.603\n\"Can we build it?\"\n\n00:10:33.627 --> 00:10:35.521\nBut we should also be asking ourselves,\n\n00:10:35.545 --> 00:10:39.258\n\"What idea of the human\ndo we want to have reflected back to us?\"\n\n00:10:39.778 --> 00:10:42.471\nThis is an essentially philosophical idea,\n\n00:10:42.495 --> 00:10:45.492\nand it's one that can't be answered\nwith software alone,\n\n00:10:45.516 --> 00:10:50.493\nbut I think requires a moment\nof species-wide, existential reflection.\n\n00:10:50.998 --> 00:10:52.151\nThank you.\n\n00:10:52.175 -->

representation of several riverine communities across Nigeria, communities whose waterways have been infested by an invasive aquatic weed; communities where economic livelihoods have been hampered: fishing, marine transportation and trading; communities where fish yields have diminished; communities where schoolchildren are unable to go to school for days, sometimes weeks, on end. Who would have thought that this plant with round leaves, inflated stems, and showy, lavender flowers would cause such havoc in these communities.The plant is known as water hyacinth and its botanical name, Eichhornia crassipes. Interestingly, in Nigeria, the plant is also known by other names, names associated with historical events, as well as myths. In some places, the plant is called Babangida. When you hear Babangida, you remember the military and military coups. And you think: fear, restraint. In parts of Nigeria in the Niger Delta, the plant is also known as Abiola. When you hear Abiola, you remember annulled elections and you think: dashed hopes. In the southwestern part of Nigeria, the plant is known as Gbe'borun. Gbe'borun is a Yoruba phrase which translates to \"gossip,\" or \"talebearer.\" When you think of gossip, you think: rapid reproduction, destruction. And in the Igala-speaking part of Nigeria, the plant is known as A Kp'iye Kp'oma, And when you hear that, you think of death. It literally translates to \"death to mother and child.\"I personally had my encounter with this plant in the year 2009. It was shortly after I had relocated from the US to Nigeria. I'd quit my job in corporate America and decided to take this big leap of faith, a leap of faith that came out of a deep sense of conviction that there was a lot of work to do in Nigeria in the area of sustainable development. And so here I was in the year 2009, actually, at the end of 2009, in Lagos on the Third Mainland Bridge.And I looked to my left and saw this very arresting image. It was an image of fishing boats that had been hemmed in by dense mats of water hyacinth. And I was really pained by what I saw because I thought to myself, \"These poor fisherfolk, how are they going to go about their daily activities with these restrictions.\" And then I thought, \"There's got to be a better way.\" A win-win solution whereby the environment is taken care of by the weeds being cleared out of the way and then this being turned into an economic benefit for the communities whose lives are impacted the most by the infestation of the weed. That, I would say, was my spark moment.And so I did further research to find out more about the beneficial uses of this weed. Out of the several, one struck me the most. It was the use of the plant for handicrafts. And I thought, \"What a great idea.\" Personally, I love handicrafts, especially handicrafts that are woven around a story. And so I thought, \"This could be easily deployed within the communities without the requirement of technical skills.\" And I thought to myself, \"Three simple steps to a mega solution.\"First step: Get out into the waterways and harvest the water hyacinth. That way, you create access.Secondly, you dry the water hyacinth stems.And thirdly, you weave the water hyacinth into products.The third step was a challenge. See, I'm a computer scientist by background and not someone in the creative arts. And so I began my quest to find out how I can learn how to weave.And this quest took me to a community in Ibadan, where I lived, called Sabo. Sabo translates to \"strangers' quarters.\" And the community is predominantly made up of people from the northern part of the country. So I literally took my dried weeds in hand, there were several more of them, and went knocking from door to door to find out who could teach me how to weave these water hyacinth stems into ropes. And I was directed to the shed of Malam Yahaya. The problem, though, is that Malam Yahaya doesn't speak English and neither did I speak Hausa. But some little kids came to the rescue and helped translate. And that began my journey of learning how to weave and transform these dried water hyacinth stems into long ropes.With my long ropes in hand, I was now equipped to make products. And that was the beginning of partnerships. Working with rattan basket makers to come up with products. So with this in hand, I felt confident that I would be able to take this knowledge back into the riverine communities and help them to transform their adversity into prosperity. So taking these weeds and actually weaving them into products that can be sold. So we have pens, we have tableware, we have purses, we have tissue boxes. Thereby, helping the communities to see water hyacinth in a different light. Seeing water hyacinth as being valuable, being aesthetic, being durable, tough, resilient. Changing names, changing livelihoods.From Gbe'borun, gossip, to Olusotan, storyteller. And from A Kp'iye Kp'oma, which is \"killer of mother and child,\" to Ya du j'ewn w'Iye kp'Oma, \"provider of food for mother and child.\"And I'd like to end with a quote by Michael Margolis. He said, \"If you want to learn about a culture, listen to the stories. And if you want to change a culture, change the stories.\"And so, from Makoko community, to Abobiri, to Ewoi, to Kolo, to Owahwa, Esaba, we have changed the story.Thank you for listening.(Applause)",

00:05:34.718\ninto long ropes.\n\n00:05:35.358 --> 00:05:37.614\nWith my long ropes in hand,\n\n00:05:37.638 --> 00:05:40.734\nI was now equipped to make products.\n\n00:05:40.758 --> 00:05:43.174\nAnd that was the beginning\nof partnerships.\n\n00:05:43.198 --> 00:05:47.174\nWorking with rattan basket makers\nto come up with products.\n\n00:05:47.198 --> 00:05:49.974\nSo with this in hand, I felt confident\n\n00:05:49.998 --> 00:05:51.998\nthat I would be able\nto take this knowledge\n\n00:05:52.022 --> 00:05:54.574\nback into the riverine communities\n\n00:05:54.598 -->

story of the Sistine Chapel", "duration": "1053", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/elizabeth_lev_the_unheard_story_of_the_sistine_chapel", "transcript": "Imagine you're in Rome, and you've made your way to the Vatican Museums. And you've been shuffling down long corridors, past statues, frescoes, lots and lots of stuff. You're heading towards the Sistine Chapel. At last \u2014 a long corridor, a stair and a door. You're at the threshold of the Sistine Chapel.So what are you expecting? Soaring domes? Choirs of angels? We don't really have any of that there. Instead, you may ask yourself, what do we have?Well, curtains up on the Sistine Chapel. And I mean literally, you're surrounded by painted curtains, the original decoration of this chapel. Churches used tapestries not just to keep out cold during long masses, but as a way to represent the great theater of life. The human drama in which each one of us plays a part is a great story, a story that encompasses the whole world and that came to unfold in the three stages of the painting in the Sistine Chapel.Now, this building started out as a space for a small group of wealthy, educated Christian priests. They prayed there. They elected their pope there. Five hundred years ago, it was the ultimate ecclesiastical man cave. So, you may ask, how can it be that today it attracts and delights five million people a year, from all different backgrounds? Because in that compressed space, there was a creative explosion, ignited by the electric excitement of new geopolitical frontiers, which set on fire the ancient missionary tradition of the Church and produced one of the greatest works of art in history.Now, this development took place as a great evolution, moving from the beginning of a few elite, and eventually able to speak to audiences of people that come from all over the world. This evolution took place in three stages, each one linked to a historical circumstance. The first one was rather limited in scope. It reflected the rather parochial perspective. The second one took place after worldviews were dramatically altered after Columbus's historical voyage; and the third, when the Age of Discovery was well under way and the Church rose to the challenge of going global.The original decoration of this church reflected a smaller world. There were busy scenes that told the stories of the lives of Jesus and Moses, reflecting the development of the Jewish and Christian people. The man who commissioned this, Pope Sixtus IV, assembled a dream team of Florentine art, including men like Sandro Botticelli and the man who would become Michelangelo's future painting teacher, Ghirlandaio. These men, they blanketed the walls with a frieze of pure color, and in these stories you'll notice familiar landscapes, the artists using Roman monuments or a Tuscan landscape to render a faraway story, something much more familiar. With the addition of images of the Pope's friends and family, this was a perfect decoration for a small court limited to the European continent. But in 1492, the New World was discovered, horizons were expanding, and this little 133 by 46-foot microcosm had to expand as well. And it did, thanks to a creative genius, a visionary and an awesome story.Now, the creative genius was Michelangelo Buonarroti, 33 years old when he was tapped to decorate 12,000 square feet of ceiling, and the deck was stacked against him \u2014 he had trained in painting but had left to pursue sculpture. There were angry patrons in Florence because he had left a stack of incomplete commissions, lured to Rome by the prospect of a great sculptural project, and that project had fallen through. And he had been left with a commission to paint 12 apostles against a decorative background in the Sistine Chapel ceiling, which would look like every other ceiling in Italy.But genius rose to the challenge. In an age when a man dared to sail across the Atlantic Ocean, Michelangelo dared to chart new artistic waters. He, too, would tell a story \u2014 no Apostles \u2014 but a story of great beginnings, the story of Genesis.Not really an easy sell, stories on a ceiling. How would you be able to read a busy scene from 62 feet below? The painting technique that had been handed on for 200 years in Florentine studios was not equipped for this kind of a narrative.But Michelangelo wasn't really a painter, and so he played to his strengths. Instead of being accustomed to filling space with busyness, he took a hammer and chisel and hacked away at a piece of marble to reveal the figure within. Michelangelo was an essentialist; he would tell his story in massive, dynamic bodies.This plan was embraced by the larger-than-life Pope Julius II, a man who was unafraid of Michelangelo's brazen genius. He was nephew to Pope Sixtus IV, and he had been steeped in art for 30 years and he knew its power. And history has handed down the moniker of the Warrior Pope, but this man's legacy to the Vatican \u2014 it wasn't fortresses and artillery, it was art. He left us the Raphael Rooms, the Sistine Chapel. He left St. Peter's Basilica as well as an extraordinary collection of Greco-Roman sculptures \u2014 decidedly un-Christian works that would become the seedbed of the world's first modern museum, the Vatican Museums. Julius was a man who envisioned a Vatican that would be eternally relevant through grandeur and through beauty, and he was right. The encounter between these two giants, Michelangelo and Julius II, that's what gave us the Sistine Chapel. Michelangelo was so committed to this project, that he succeeded in getting the job done in three and a half years, using a skeleton crew and spending most of the time, hours on end, reaching up above his head to paint the stories on the ceiling.So let's look at this ceiling and see storytelling gone global. No more familiar artistic references to the world around you. There's just space and structure and energy; a monumental painted framework which opens onto nine panels, more driven by sculptural form than painterly color. And we stand in the far end by the entrance, far from the altar and from the gated enclosure intended for the clergy and we peer into the distance, looking for a beginning. And whether in scientific inquiry or in biblical tradition, we think in terms of a primal spark. Michelangelo gave us an initial energy when he gave us the separation of light and dark, a churning figure blurry in the distance, compressed into a tight space. The next figure looms larger, and you see a figure hurtling from one side to the next. He leaves in his wake the sun, the moon, vegetation. Michelangelo didn't focus on the stuff that was being created, unlike all the other artists. He focused on the act of creation.And then the movement stops, like a caesura in poetry and the creator hovers. So what's he doing? Is he creating land? Is he creating sea? Or is he looking back over his handiwork, the universe and his treasures, just like Michelangelo must have, looking back over his work in the ceiling and proclaiming, \"It is good.\"So now the scene is set, and you get to the culmination of creation, which is man. Adam leaps to the eye, a light figure against a dark background. But looking closer, that leg is pretty languid on the ground, the arm is heavy on the knee. Adam lacks that interior spark that will impel him to greatness. That spark is about to be conferred by the creator in that finger, which is one millimeter from the hand of Adam. It puts us at the edge of our seats, because we're one moment from that contact, through which that man will discover his purpose, leap up and take his place at the pinnacle of creation.And then Michelangelo threw a curveball. Who is in that other arm? Eve, first woman. No, she's not an afterthought. She's part of the plan. She's always been in his mind. Look at her, so intimate with God that her hand curls around his arm. And for me, an American art historian from the 21st century, this was the moment that the painting spoke to me. Because I realized that this representation of the human drama was always about men and women \u2014 so much so, that the dead center, the heart of the ceiling, is the creation of woman, not Adam. And the fact is, that when you see them together in the Garden of Eden, they fall together and together their proud posture turns into folded shame.You are at critical juncture now in the ceiling. You are exactly at the point where you and I can go no further into the church. The gated enclosure keeps us out of the inner sanctum, and we are cast out much like Adam and Eve. The remaining scenes in the ceiling, they mirror the crowded chaos of the world around us. You have Noah and his Ark and the flood. You have Noah. He's making a sacrifice and a covenant with God. Maybe he's the savior. Oh, but no, Noah is the one who grew grapes, invented wine, got drunk and passed out naked in his barn. It is a curious way to design the ceiling, now starting out with God creating life, ending up with some guy blind drunk in a barn. And so, compared with Adam, you might think Michelangelo is making fun of us.But he's about to dispel the gloom by using those bright colors right underneath Noah: emerald, topaz, scarlet on the prophet Zechariah. Zechariah foresees a light coming from the east, and we are turned at this juncture to a new destination, with sibyls and prophets who will lead us on a parade. You have the heroes and heroines who make safe the way, and we follow the mothers and fathers. They are the motors of this great human engine, driving it forward.And now we're at the keystone of the ceiling, the culmination of the whole thing, with a figure that looks like he's about to fall out of his space into our space, encroaching our space.This is the most important juncture. Past meets present. This figure, Jonah, who spent three days in the belly of the whale, for the Christians, is the symbol of the renewal of humanity through Jesus' sacrifice, but for the multitudes of visitors to that museum from all faiths who visit there every day, he is the moment the distant past encounters and meets immediate reality.All of this brings us to the yawning archway of the altar wall, where we see Michelangelo's Last Judgment, painted in 1534 after the world had changed again. The Reformation had splintered the Church, the Ottoman Empire had made Islam a household word and Magellan had found a route into the Pacific Ocean. How is a 59-year-old artist who has never been any further than Venice going to speak to this new world? Michelangelo chose to paint destiny, that universal desire, common to all of us, to leave a legacy of excellence. Told in terms of the Christian vision of the Last Judgment, the end of the world, Michelangelo gave you a series of figures who are wearing these strikingly beautiful bodies. They have no more covers, no more portraits except for a couple. It's a composition only out of bodies, 391, no two alike, unique like each and every one of us. They start in the lower corner, breaking away from the ground, struggling and trying to rise. Those who have risen reach back to help others, and in one amazing vignette, you have a black man and a white man pulled up together in an incredible vision of human unity in this new world. The lion's share of the space goes to the winner's circle. There you find men and women completely nude like athletes. They are the ones who have overcome adversity, and Michelangelo's vision of people who combat adversity, overcome obstacles \u2014 they're just like athletes. So you have men and women flexing and posing in this extraordinary spotlight. Presiding over this assembly is Jesus, first a suffering man on the cross, now a glorious ruler in Heaven. And as Michelangelo proved in his painting, hardship, setbacks and obstacles, they don't limit excellence, they forge it.Now, this does lead us to one odd thing. This is the Pope's private chapel, and the best way you can describe that is indeed a stew of nudes. But Michelangelo was trying to use only the best artistic language, the most universal artistic language he could think of: that of the human body. And so instead of the way of showing virtue such as fortitude or self-mastery, he borrowed from Julius II's wonderful collection of sculptures in order to show inner strength as external power.Now, one contemporary did write that the chapel was too beautiful to not cause controversy. And so it did. Michelangelo soon found that thanks to the printing press, complaints about the nudity spread all over the place, and soon his masterpiece of human drama was labeled pornography, at which point he added two more portraits, one of the man who criticized him, a papal courtier, and the other one of himself as a dried up husk, no athlete, in the hands of a long-suffering martyr. The year he died he saw several of these figures covered over, a triumph for trivial distractions over his great exhortation to glory.And so now we stand in the here and now. We are caught in that space between beginnings and endings, in the great, huge totality of the human experience. The Sistine Chapel forces us to look around as if it were a mirror. Who am I in this picture? Am I one of the crowd? Am I the drunk guy? Am I the athlete? And as we leave this haven of uplifting beauty, we are inspired to ask ourselves life's biggest questions: Who am I, and what role do I play in this great theater of life?Thank you.(Applause)Bruno Giussani: Elizabeth Lev, thank you.Elizabeth, you mentioned this whole issue of pornography, too many nudes and too many daily life scenes and improper things in the eyes of the time. But actually the story is bigger. It's not just touching up and covering up some of the figures. This work of art was almost destroyed because of that.Elizabeth Lev: The effect of the Last Judgment was enormous. The printing press made sure that everybody saw it. And so, this wasn't something that happened within a couple of weeks. It was something that happened over the space of 20 years of editorials and complaints, saying to the Church, \"You can't possibly tell us how to live our lives. Did you notice you have pornography in the Pope's chapel?\" And so after complaints and insistence of trying to get this work destroyed, it was finally the year that Michelangelo died that the Church finally found a compromise, a way to save the painting, and that was in putting up these extra 30 covers, and that happens to be the origin of fig-leafing. That's where it all came about, and it came about from a church that was trying to save a work of art, not indeed deface or destroyed it.BG: This, what you just gave us, is not the classic tour that people get today when they go to the Sistine Chapel.(Laughter)EL: I don't know, is that an ad?(Laughter)BG: No, no, no, not necessarily, it is a statement. The experience of art today is encountering problems. Too many people want to see this there, and the result is five million people going through that tiny door and experiencing it in a completely different way than we just did.EL: Right. I agree. I think it's really nice to be able to pause and look. But also realize, even when you're in those days, with 28,000 people a day, even those days when you're in there with all those other people, look around you and think how amazing it is that some painted plaster from 500 years ago can still draw all those people standing side by side with you, looking upwards with their jaws dropped. It's a great statement about how beauty truly can speak to us all through time and through geographic space.BG: Liz, grazie.EL: Grazie a te.BG: Thank you.(Applause)", "id": 2415, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:14.645\nImagine you're in Rome,\n\n00:00:14.669 --> 00:00:17.872\nand you've made your way\nto the Vatican Museums.\n\n00:00:18.259 --> 00:00:21.502\nAnd you've been shuffling\ndown long corridors,\n\n00:00:21.526 --> 00:00:25.966\npast statues, frescoes,\nlots and lots of stuff.\n\n00:00:26.338 --> 00:00:28.683\nYou're heading towards the Sistine Chapel.\n\n00:00:28.707 --> 00:00:34.083\nAt last -- a long corridor,\na stair and a door.\n\n00:00:34.107 --> 00:00:37.105\nYou're at the threshold\nof the Sistine Chapel.\n\n00:00:37.129 --> 00:00:38.893\nSo what are you expecting?\n\n00:00:38.917 --> 00:00:41.441\nSoaring domes?

Buonarroti,\n\n00:03:54.739 --> 00:03:59.129\n33 years old when he was tapped\nto decorate 12,000 square feet of ceiling,\n\n00:03:59.153 --> 00:04:01.034\nand the deck was stacked against him --\n\n00:04:01.058 --> 00:04:03.954\nhe had trained in painting\nbut had left to pursue sculpture.\n\n00:04:03.978 --> 00:04:07.436\nThere were angry patrons in Florence\nbecause he had left a stack\n\n00:04:07.460 --> 00:04:09.134\nof incomplete commissions,\n\n00:04:09.158 --> 00:04:12.821\nlured to Rome by the prospect\nof a great sculptural project,\n\n00:04:12.845 --> 00:04:15.426\nand that project had fallen through.\n\n00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:18.579\nAnd he had been left with a commission\nto paint 12 apostles\n\n00:04:18.603 --> 00:04:21.524\nagainst a decorative background\nin the Sistine Chapel ceiling,\n\n00:04:21.548 --> 00:04:25.086\nwhich would look like\nevery other ceiling in Italy.\n\n00:04:25.573 --> 00:04:27.404\nBut genius rose to the challenge.\n\n00:04:27.428 --> 00:04:30.926\nIn an age when a man dared\nto sail across the Atlantic Ocean,\n\n00:04:30.950 --> 00:04:34.478\nMichelangelo dared to chart\nnew artistic waters.\n\n00:04:34.985 --> 00:04:37.221\nHe, too, would tell a story --\n\n00:04:37.245 --> 00:04:40.777\nno Apostles -- but a story\nof great beginnings,\n\n00:04:40.801 --> 00:04:42.473\nthe story of Genesis.\n\n00:04:43.045 --> 00:04:45.976\nNot really an easy sell,\nstories on a ceiling.\n\n00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:50.808\nHow would you be able to read\na busy scene from 62 feet below?\n\n00:04:50.832 --> 00:04:53.687\nThe painting technique that had been\nhanded on for 200 years\n\n00:04:53.711 --> 00:04:57.025\nin Florentine studios was not equipped\nfor this kind of a narrative.\n\n00:04:57.652 --> 00:05:00.620\nBut Michelangelo wasn't really a painter,\n\n00:05:00.644 --> 00:05:02.928\nand so he played to his strengths.\n\n00:05:02.952 --> 00:05:06.434\nInstead of being accustomed\nto filling space with busyness,\n\n00:05:06.458 --> 00:05:10.257\nhe took a hammer and chisel\nand hacked away at a piece of marble\n\n00:05:10.281 --> 00:05:12.711\nto reveal the figure within.\n\n00:05:12.735 --> 00:05:14.903\nMichelangelo was an essentialist;\n\n00:05:14.927 --> 00:05:19.313\nhe would tell his story\nin massive, dynamic bodies.\n\n00:05:19.337 --> 00:05:24.104\nThis plan was embraced\nby the larger-than-life Pope Julius II,\n\n00:05:24.128 --> 00:05:27.749\na man who was unafraid\nof Michelangelo's brazen genius.\n\n00:05:27.773 --> 00:05:29.655\nHe was nephew to Pope Sixtus IV,\n\n00:05:29.679 --> 00:05:33.786\nand he had been steeped in art\nfor 30 years and he knew its power.\n\n00:05:33.810 --> 00:05:36.874\nAnd history has handed down the moniker\nof the Warrior Pope,\n\n00:05:36.898 --> 00:05:40.688\nbut this man's legacy to the Vatican --\nit wasn't fortresses and artillery,\n\n00:05:40.712 --> 00:05:42.028\nit was art.\n\n00:05:42.052 --> 00:05:44.631\nHe left us the Raphael Rooms,\nthe Sistine Chapel.\n\n00:05:44.655 --> 00:05:46.300\nHe left St. Peter's Basilica\n\n00:05:46.324 --> 00:05:52.027\nas well as an extraordinary collection\nof Greco-Roman sculptures --\n\n00:05:52.051 --> 00:05:56.191\ndecidedly un-Christian works\nthat would become the seedbed\n\n00:05:56.215 --> 00:06:00.100\nof the world's first modern museum,\nthe Vatican Museums.\n\n00:06:00.805 --> 00:06:02.229\nJulius was a man\n\n00:06:02.253 --> 00:06:06.037\nwho envisioned a Vatican\nthat would be eternally relevant\n\n00:06:06.061 --> 00:06:08.150\nthrough grandeur and through beauty,\n\n00:06:08.174 --> 00:06:09.546\nand he was right.\n\n00:06:09.570 --> 00:06:14.558\nThe encounter between these two giants,\nMichelangelo and Julius II,\n\n00:06:14.582 --> 00:06:17.019\nthat's what gave us the Sistine Chapel.\n\n00:06:17.599 --> 00:06:20.386\nMichelangelo was so committed\nto this project,\n\n00:06:20.410 --> 00:06:24.793\nthat he succeeded in getting the job done\nin three and a half years,\n\n00:06:24.817 --> 00:06:29.086\nusing a skeleton crew and spending\nmost of the time, hours on end,\n\n00:06:29.110 --> 00:06:32.801\nreaching up above his head\nto paint the stories on the ceiling.\n\n00:06:33.382 --> 00:06:35.432\nSo let's look at this ceiling\n\n00:06:35.456 --> 00:06:38.287\nand see storytelling gone global.\n\n00:06:38.311 --> 00:06:42.723\nNo more familiar artistic references\nto the world around you.\n\n00:06:42.747 --> 00:06:47.390\nThere's just space\nand structure and energy;\n\n00:06:47.414 --> 00:06:52.011\na monumental painted framework\nwhich opens onto nine panels,\n\n00:06:52.035 --> 00:06:55.968\nmore driven by sculptural form\nthan painterly color.\n\n00:06:55.992 --> 00:06:59.769\nAnd we stand in the far end\nby the entrance,\n\n00:06:59.793 --> 00:07:03.899\nfar from the altar and from the gated\nenclosure intended for the clergy\n\n00:07:03.923 --> 00:07:09.170\nand we peer into the distance,\nlooking for a beginning.\n\n00:07:09.194 --> 00:07:13.210\nAnd whether in scientific inquiry\nor in biblical tradition,\n\n00:07:13.234 --> 00:07:16.554\nwe think in terms of a primal spark.\n\n00:07:16.578 --> 00:07:18.711\nMichelangelo gave us an initial energy\n\n00:07:18.735 --> 00:07:21.476\nwhen he gave us the separation\nof light and dark,\n\n00:07:21.500 --> 00:07:24.889\na churning figure blurry in the distance,\n\n00:07:24.913 --> 00:07:27.397\ncompressed into a tight space.\n\n00:07:27.421 --> 00:07:29.750\nThe next figure looms larger,\n\n00:07:29.774 --> 00:07:33.201\nand you see a figure hurtling\nfrom one side to the next.\n\n00:07:33.225 --> 00:07:38.211\nHe leaves in his wake\nthe sun, the moon, vegetation.\n\n00:07:38.235 --> 00:07:42.242\nMichelangelo didn't focus\non the stuff that was being created,\n\n00:07:42.266 --> 00:07:44.310\nunlike all the other artists.\n\n00:07:44.334 --> 00:07:47.677\nHe focused on the act of creation.\n\n00:07:47.701 --> 00:07:52.075\nAnd then the movement stops,\nlike a caesura in poetry\n\n00:07:52.099 --> 00:07:53.351\nand the creator hovers.\n\n00:07:53.375 --> 00:07:54.654\nSo what's he doing?\n\n00:07:54.678 --> 00:07:57.533\nIs he creating land? Is he creating sea?\n\n00:07:57.557 --> 00:08:02.248\nOr is he looking back over his handiwork,\nthe universe and his treasures,\n\n00:08:02.272 --> 00:08:04.003\njust like Michelangelo must have,\n\n00:08:04.027 --> 00:08:06.624\nlooking back over his work in the ceiling\n\n00:08:06.648 --> 00:08:09.442\nand proclaiming, \"It is good.\"\n\n00:08:10.346 --> 00:08:12.451\nSo now the scene is set,\n\n00:08:12.475 --> 00:08:16.153\nand you get to the culmination\nof creation, which is man.\n\n00:08:16.177 --> 00:08:20.507\nAdam leaps to the eye, a light figure\nagainst a dark background.\n\n00:08:20.531 --> 00:08:22.289\nBut looking closer,\n\n00:08:22.313 --> 00:08:24.965\nthat leg is pretty languid on the ground,\n\n00:08:24.989 --> 00:08:27.279\nthe arm is heavy on the knee.\n\n00:08:27.303 --> 00:08:30.980\nAdam lacks that interior spark\n\n00:08:31.004 --> 00:08:33.292\nthat will impel him to greatness.\n\n00:08:33.316 --> 00:08:38.081\nThat spark is about to be conferred\nby the creator in that finger,\n\n00:08:38.105 --> 00:08:40.776\nwhich is one millimeter\nfrom the hand of Adam.\n\n00:08:40.800 --> 00:08:42.745\nIt puts us at the edge of our seats,\n\n00:08:42.769 --> 00:08:45.784\nbecause we're one moment\nfrom that contact,\n\n00:08:45.808 --> 00:08:48.709\nthrough which that man\nwill discover his purpose,\n\n00:08:48.733 --> 00:08:51.717\nleap up and take his place\nat the pinnacle of creation.\n\n00:08:51.741 --> 00:08:55.002\nAnd then Michelangelo threw a curveball.\n\n00:08:55.026 --> 00:08:56.854\nWho is in that other arm?\n\n00:08:57.489 --> 00:08:59.185\nEve, first woman.\n\n00:08:59.209 --> 00:09:02.118\nNo, she's not an afterthought.\nShe's part of the plan.\n\n00:09:02.142 --> 00:09:04.615\nShe's always been in his mind.\n\n00:09:04.639 --> 00:09:08.844\nLook at her, so intimate with God\nthat her hand curls around his arm.\n\n00:09:09.287 --> 00:09:14.695\nAnd for me, an American art historian\nfrom the 21st century,\n\n00:09:14.719 --> 00:09:17.571\nthis was the moment\nthat the painting spoke to me.\n\n00:09:17.595 --> 00:09:20.943\nBecause I realized that this\nrepresentation of the human drama\n\n00:09:20.967 --> 00:09:23.880\nwas always about men and women --\n\n00:09:23.904 --> 00:09:27.694\nso much so, that the dead center,\nthe heart of the ceiling,\n\n00:09:27.718 --> 00:09:30.132\nis the creation of woman, not Adam.\n\n00:09:30.156 --> 00:09:34.080\nAnd the fact is, that when you see them\ntogether in the Garden of Eden,\n\n00:09:34.104 --> 00:09:35.641\nthey fall together\n\n00:09:35.665 --> 00:09:40.057\nand together their proud posture\nturns into folded shame.\n\n00:09:40.605 --> 00:09:43.274\nYou are at critical juncture\nnow in the ceiling.\n\n00:09:43.298 --> 00:09:46.381\nYou are exactly at the point\nwhere you and I can go\n\n00:09:46.405 --> 00:09:47.860\nno further into the church.\n\n00:09:47.884 --> 00:09:51.240\nThe gated enclosure keeps us\nout of the inner sanctum,\n\n00:09:51.264 --> 00:09:53.777\nand we are cast out\nmuch like Adam and Eve.\n\n00:09:53.801 --> 00:09:55.557\nThe remaining scenes in the ceiling,\n\n00:09:55.581 --> 00:09:58.425\nthey mirror the crowded chaos\nof the world around us.\n\n00:09:58.449 --> 00:10:00.673\nYou have Noah and his Ark and the flood.\n\n00:10:00.697 --> 00:10:04.287\nYou have Noah. He's making a sacrifice\nand a covenant with God.\n\n00:10:04.311 --> 00:10:05.597\nMaybe he's the savior.\n\n00:10:05.989 --> 00:10:09.721\nOh, but no, Noah is the one\nwho grew grapes, invented wine,\n\n00:10:09.745 --> 00:10:11.903\ngot drunk and passed out\nnaked in his barn.\n\n00:10:12.343 --> 00:10:14.717\nIt is a curious way to design the ceiling,\n\n00:10:14.741 --> 00:10:16.665\nnow starting out with God creating life,\n\n00:10:16.689 --> 00:10:19.184\nending up with some guy\nblind drunk in a barn.\n\n00:10:19.208 --> 00:10:21.664\nAnd so, compared with Adam,\n\n00:10:21.688 --> 00:10:24.206\nyou might think Michelangelo\nis making fun of us.\n\n00:10:24.651 --> 00:10:26.694\nBut he's about to dispel the gloom\n\n00:10:26.718 --> 00:10:30.236\nby using those bright colors\nright underneath Noah:\n\n00:10:30.260 --> 00:10:33.650\nemerald, topaz, scarlet\non the prophet Zechariah.\n\n00:10:33.674 --> 00:10:36.653\nZechariah foresees a light\ncoming from the east,\n\n00:10:36.677 --> 00:10:40.365\nand we are turned at this juncture\nto a new destination,\n\n00:10:40.389 --> 00:10:44.264\nwith sibyls and prophets\nwho will lead us on a parade.\n\n00:10:44.288 --> 00:10:47.586\nYou have the heroes and heroines\nwho make safe the way,\n\n00:10:47.610 --> 00:10:50.094\nand we follow the mothers and fathers.\n\n00:10:50.118 --> 00:10:54.203\nThey are the motors of this great\nhuman engine, driving it forward.\n\n00:10:54.227 --> 00:10:57.134\nAnd now we're at the keystone\nof the ceiling,\n\n00:10:57.158 --> 00:10:59.337\nthe culmination of the whole thing,\n\n00:10:59.361 --> 00:11:02.591\nwith a figure that looks like\nhe's about to fall out of his space\n\n00:11:02.615 --> 00:11:03.955\ninto our space,\n\n00:11:03.979 --> 00:11:05.262\nencroaching our space.\n\n00:11:05.286 --> 00:11:07.827\nThis is the most important juncture.\n\n00:11:07.851 --> 00:11:09.723\nPast meets present.\n\n00:11:09.747 --> 00:11:12.963\nThis figure, Jonah, who spent\nthree days in the belly of the whale,\n\n00:11:12.987 --> 00:11:15.840\nfor the Christians, is the symbol\nof the renewal of humanity\n\n00:11:15.864 --> 00:11:17.127\nthrough Jesus' sacrifice,\n\n00:11:17.151 --> 00:11:19.899\nbut for the multitudes\nof visitors to that museum\n\n00:11:19.923 --> 00:11:22.693\nfrom all faiths who visit there every day,\n\n00:11:22.717 --> 00:11:29.303\nhe is the moment the distant past\nencounters and meets immediate reality.\n\n00:11:30.049 --> 00:11:34.642\nAll of this brings us to the yawning\narchway of the altar wall,\n\n00:11:34.666 --> 00:11:37.429\nwhere we see Michelangelo's Last Judgment,\n\n00:11:37.453 --> 00:11:41.319\npainted in 1534 after the world\nhad changed again.\n\n00:11:41.343 --> 00:11:43.367\nThe Reformation had splintered the Church,\n\n00:11:43.391 --> 00:11:46.259\nthe Ottoman Empire had made\nIslam a household word\n\n00:11:46.283 --> 00:11:49.777\nand Magellan had found a route\ninto the Pacific Ocean.\n\n00:11:49.801 --> 00:11:54.463\nHow is a 59-year-old artist who has never\nbeen any further than Venice\n\n00:11:54.487 --> 00:11:56.681\ngoing to speak to this new world?\n\n00:11:56.705 --> 00:11:59.748\nMichelangelo chose to paint destiny,\n\n00:11:59.772 --> 00:12:01.592\nthat universal desire,\n\n00:12:01.616 --> 00:12:03.236\ncommon to all of us,\n\n00:12:03.260 --> 00:12:06.429\nto leave a legacy of excellence.\n\n00:12:06.453 --> 00:12:09.384\nTold in terms of the Christian vision\nof the Last Judgment,\n\n00:12:09.408 --> 00:12:10.720\nthe end of the world,\n\n00:12:10.744 --> 00:12:13.882\nMichelangelo gave you a series of figures\n\n00:12:13.906 --> 00:12:17.061\nwho are wearing these\nstrikingly beautiful bodies.\n\n00:12:17.085 --> 00:12:19.807\nThey have no more covers,\nno more portraits\n\n00:12:19.831 --> 00:12:21.068\nexcept for a couple.\n\n00:12:21.092 --> 00:12:23.810\nIt's a composition only out of bodies,\n\n00:12:23.834 --> 00:12:27.220\n391, no two alike,\n\n00:12:27.244 --> 00:12:29.698\nunique like each and every one of us.\n\n00:12:29.722 --> 00:12:33.464\nThey start in the lower corner,\nbreaking away from the ground,\n\n00:12:33.488 --> 00:12:36.210\nstruggling and trying to rise.\n\n00:12:36.234 --> 00:12:38.690\nThose who have risen\nreach back to help others,\n\n00:12:38.714 --> 00:12:40.551\nand in one amazing vignette,\n\n00:12:40.575 --> 00:12:43.667\nyou have a black man and a white man\npulled up together\n\n00:12:43.691 --> 00:12:46.413\nin an incredible vision of human unity\n\n00:12:46.437 --> 00:12:47.879\nin this new world.\n\n00:12:47.903 --> 00:12:51.410\nThe lion's share of the space\ngoes to the winner's circle.\n\n00:12:51.434 --> 00:12:56.270\nThere you find men and women\ncompletely nude like athletes.\n\n00:12:56.294 --> 00:12:58.606\nThey are the ones\nwho have overcome adversity,\n\n00:12:58.630 --> 00:13:02.344\nand Michelangelo's vision\nof people who combat adversity,\n\n00:13:02.368 --> 00:13:03.642\novercome obstacles --\n\n00:13:03.666 --> 00:13:05.560\nthey're just like athletes.\n\n00:13:05.584 --> 00:13:09.013\nSo you have men and women\nflexing and posing\n\n00:13:09.037 --> 00:13:11.121\nin this extraordinary spotlight.\n\n00:13:11.513 --> 00:13:14.058\nPresiding over this assembly is Jesus,\n\n00:13:14.082 --> 00:13:16.100\nfirst a suffering man on the cross,\n\n00:13:16.124 --> 00:13:18.528\nnow a glorious ruler in Heaven.\n\n00:13:18.552 --> 00:13:21.570\nAnd as Michelangelo\nproved in his painting,\n\n00:13:21.594 --> 00:13:24.172\nhardship, setbacks and obstacles,\n\n00:13:24.196 --> 00:13:27.430\nthey don't limit excellence,\nthey forge it.\n\n00:13:28.234 --> 00:13:30.822\nNow, this does lead us to one odd thing.\n\n00:13:30.846 --> 00:13:32.663\nThis is the Pope's private chapel,\n\n00:13:32.687 --> 00:13:35.844\nand the best way you can describe that\nis indeed a stew of nudes.\n\n00:13:35.868 --> 00:13:39.631\nBut Michelangelo was trying to use\nonly the best artistic language,\n\n00:13:39.655 --> 00:13:42.243\nthe most universal artistic language\nhe could think of:\n\n00:13:42.267 --> 00:13:44.027\nthat of the human body.\n\n00:13:44.051 --> 00:13:49.857\nAnd so instead of the way of showing\nvirtue such as fortitude or self-mastery,\n\n00:13:49.881 --> 00:13:54.146\nhe borrowed from Julius II's\nwonderful collection of sculptures\n\n00:13:54.170 --> 00:13:58.421\nin order to show inner strength\nas external power.\n\n00:13:59.326 --> 00:14:02.691\nNow, one contemporary did write\n\n00:14:02.715 --> 00:14:06.573\nthat the chapel was too beautiful\nto not cause controversy.\n\n00:14:06.597 --> 00:14:07.946\nAnd so it did.\n\n00:14:07.970 --> 00:14:11.508\nMichelangelo soon found\nthat thanks to the printing press,\n\n00:14:11.532 --> 00:14:14.654\ncomplaints about the nudity\nspread all over the place,\n\n00:14:14.678 --> 00:14:18.974\nand soon his masterpiece of human drama\nwas labeled pornography,\n\n00:14:18.998 --> 00:14:21.173\nat which point he added\ntwo more portraits,\n\n00:14:21.197 --> 00:14:23.681\none of the man who criticized him,\na papal courtier,\n\n00:14:23.705 --> 00:14:27.837\nand the other one of himself\nas a dried up husk, no athlete,\n\n00:14:27.861 --> 00:14:30.282\nin the hands of a long-suffering martyr.\n\n00:14:30.306 --> 00:14:33.974\nThe year he died he saw\nseveral of these figures covered over,\n\n00:14:33.998 --> 00:14:39.617\na triumph for trivial distractions\nover his great exhortation to glory.\n\n00:14:40.125 --> 00:14:41.889\nAnd so

In the West, we make a colossal mistake taking it for granted. We see democracy not as the most fragile of flowers that it really is, but we see it as part of our society's furniture. We tend to think of it as an intransigent given. We mistakenly believe that capitalism begets inevitably democracy. It doesn't.Singapore's Lee Kuan Yew and his great imitators in Beijing have demonstrated beyond reasonable doubt that it is perfectly possible to have a flourishing capitalism, spectacular growth, while politics remains democracy-free. Indeed, democracy is receding in our neck of the woods, here in Europe.Earlier this year, while I was representing Greece \u2014 the newly elected Greek government \u2014 in the Eurogroup as its Finance Minister, I was told in no uncertain terms that our nation's democratic process \u2014 our elections \u2014 could not be allowed to interfere with economic policies that were being implemented in Greece. At that moment, I felt that there could be no greater vindication of Lee Kuan Yew, or the Chinese Communist Party, indeed of some recalcitrant friends of mine who kept telling me that democracy would be banned if it ever threatened to change anything.Tonight, here, I want to present to you an economic case for an authentic democracy. I want to ask you to join me in believing again that Lee Kuan Yew, the Chinese Communist Party and indeed the Eurogroup are wrong in believing that we can dispense with democracy \u2014 that we need an authentic, boisterous democracy. And without democracy, our societies will be nastier, our future bleak and our great, new technologies wasted.Speaking of waste, allow me to point out an interesting paradox that is threatening our economies as we speak. I call it the twin peaks paradox. One peak you understand \u2014 you know it, you recognize it \u2014 is the mountain of debts that has been casting a long shadow over the United States, Europe, the whole world. We all recognize the mountain of debts. But few people discern its twin. A mountain of idle cash belonging to rich savers and to corporations, too terrified to invest it into the productive activities that can generate the incomes from which you can extinguish the mountain of debts and which can produce all those things that humanity desperately needs, like green energy.Now let me give you two numbers. Over the last three months, in the United States, in Britain and in the Eurozone, we have invested, collectively, 3.4 trillion dollars on all the wealth-producing goods \u2014 things like industrial plants, machinery, office blocks, schools, roads, railways, machinery, and so on and so forth. $3.4 trillion sounds like a lot of money until you compare it to the $5.1 trillion that has been slushing around in the same countries, in our financial institutions, doing absolutely nothing during the same period except inflating stock exchanges and bidding up house prices.So a mountain of debt and a mountain of idle cash form twin peaks,  failing to cancel each other out through the normal operation of the markets.The result is stagnant wages, more than a quarter of 25- to 54-year-olds in America, in Japan and in Europe out of work. And consequently, low aggregate demand, which in a never-ending cycle, reinforces the pessimism of the investors, who, fearing low demand, reproduce it by not investing \u2014 exactly like Oedipus' father, who, terrified by the prophecy of the oracle that his son would grow up to kill him, unwittingly engineered the conditions that ensured that Oedipus, his son, would kill him.This is my quarrel with capitalism. Its gross wastefulness, all this idle cash, should be energized to improve lives, to develop human talents, and indeed to finance all these technologies, green technologies, which are absolutely essential for saving planet Earth.Am I right in believing that democracy might be the answer? I believe so, but before we move on, what do we mean by democracy? Aristotle defined democracy as the constitution in which the free and the poor, being in the majority, control government.Now, of course Athenian democracy excluded too many. Women, migrants and, of course, the slaves. But it would be a mistake to dismiss the significance of ancient Athenian democracy on the basis of whom it excluded.What was more pertinent, and continues to be so about ancient Athenian democracy, was the inclusion of the working poor, who not only acquired the right to free speech, but more importantly, crucially, they acquired the rights to political judgments that were afforded equal weight in the decision-making concerning matters of state. Now, of course, Athenian democracy didn't last long. Like a candle that burns brightly, it burned out quickly. And indeed, our liberal democracies today do not have their roots in ancient Athens. They have their roots in the Magna Carta, in the 1688 Glorious Revolution, indeed in the American constitution. Whereas Athenian democracy was focusing on the masterless citizen and empowering the working poor, our liberal democracies are founded on the Magna Carta tradition, which was, after all, a charter for masters. And indeed, liberal democracy only surfaced when it was possible to separate fully the political sphere from the economic sphere, so as to confine the democratic process fully in the political sphere, leaving the economic sphere \u2014 the corporate world, if you want \u2014 as a democracy-free zone.Now, in our democracies today, this separation of the economic from the political sphere, the moment it started happening, it gave rise to an inexorable, epic struggle between the two, with the economic sphere colonizing the political sphere, eating into its power.Have you wondered why politicians are not what they used to be? It's not because their DNA has degenerated.(Laughter)It is rather because one can be in government today and not in power, because power has migrated from the political to the economic sphere, which is separate.Indeed, I spoke about my quarrel with capitalism. If you think about it, it is a little bit like a population of predators, that are so successful in decimating the prey that they must feed on, that in the end they starve.Similarly, the economic sphere has been colonizing and cannibalizing the political sphere to such an extent that it is undermining itself, causing economic crisis. Corporate power is increasing, political goods are devaluing, inequality is rising, aggregate demand is falling and CEOs of corporations are too scared to invest the cash of their corporations.So the more capitalism succeeds in taking the demos out of democracy, the taller the twin peaks and the greater the waste of human resources and humanity's wealth.Clearly, if this is right, we must reunite the political and economic spheres and better do it with a demos being in control, like in ancient Athens except without the slaves or the exclusion of women and migrants.Now, this is not an original idea. The Marxist left had that idea 100 years ago and it didn't go very well, did it?The lesson that we learned from the Soviet debacle is that only by a miracle will the working poor be reempowered, as they were in ancient Athens, without creating new forms of brutality and waste.But there is a solution: eliminate the working poor. Capitalism's doing it by replacing low-wage workers with automata, androids, robots. The problem is that as long as the economic and the political spheres are separate, automation makes the twin peaks taller, the waste loftier and the social conflicts deeper, including \u2014 soon, I believe \u2014 in places like China.So we need to reconfigure, we need to reunite the economic and the political spheres, but we'd better do it by democratizing the reunified sphere, lest we end up with a surveillance-mad hyperautocracy that makes The Matrix, the movie, look like a documentary.(Laughter)So the question is not whether capitalism will survive the technological innovations it is spawning. The more interesting question is whether capitalism will be succeeded by something resembling a Matrix dystopia or something much closer to a Star Trek-like society, where machines serve the humans and the humans expend their energies exploring the universe and indulging in long debates about the meaning of life in some ancient, Athenian-like, high tech agora.I think we can afford to be optimistic. But what would it take, what would it look like to have this Star Trek-like utopia, instead of the Matrix-like dystopia?In practical terms, allow me to share just briefly, a couple of examples.At the level of the enterprise, imagine a capital market, where you earn capital as you work, and where your capital follows you from one job to another, from one company to another, and the company \u2014 whichever one you happen to work at at that time \u2014 is solely owned by those who happen to work in it at that moment. Then all income stems from capital, from profits, and the very concept of wage labor becomes obsolete. No more separation between those who own but do not work in the company and those who work but do not own the company; no more tug-of-war between capital and labor; no great gap between investment and saving; indeed, no towering twin peaks.At the level of the global political economy, imagine for a moment that our national currencies have a free-floating exchange rate, with a universal, global, digital currency, one that is issued by the International Monetary Fund, the G-20, on behalf of all humanity. And imagine further that all international trade is denominated in this currency \u2014 let's call it \"the cosmos,\" in units of cosmos \u2014 with every government agreeing to be paying into a common fund a sum of cosmos units proportional to the country's trade deficit, or indeed to a country's trade surplus. And imagine that that fund is utilized to invest in green technologies, especially in parts of the world where investment funding is scarce.This is not a new idea. It's what, effectively, John Maynard Keynes proposed in 1944 at the Bretton Woods Conference. The problem is that back then, they didn't have the technology to implement it. Now we do, especially in the context of a reunified political-economic sphere.The world that I am describing to you is simultaneously libertarian, in that it prioritizes empowered individuals, Marxist, since it will have confined to the dustbin of history the division between capital and labor, and Keynesian, global Keynesian. But above all else, it is a world in which we will be able to imagine an authentic democracy.Will such a world dawn? Or shall we descend into a Matrix-like dystopia? The answer lies in the political choice that we shall be making collectively. It is our choice, and we'd better make it democratically.Thank you.(Applause)Bruno Giussani: Yanis ... It was you who described yourself in your bios as a libertarian Marxist. What is the relevance of Marx's analysis today?Yanis Varoufakis: Well, if there was any relevance in what I just said, then Marx is relevant. Because the whole point of reunifying the political and economic is \u2014 if we don't do it, then technological innovation is going to create such a massive fall in aggregate demand,what Larry Summers refers to as secular stagnation. With this crisis migrating from one part of the world, as it is now, it will destabilize not only our democracies, but even the emerging world that is not that keen on liberal democracy. So if this analysis holds water, then Marx is absolutely relevant. But so is Hayek, that's why I'm a libertarian Marxist, and so is Keynes, so that's why I'm totally confused.(Laughter)BG: Indeed, and possibly we are too, now.(Laughter)(Applause)YV: If you are not confused, you are not thinking, OK?BG: That's a very, very Greek philosopher kind of thing to say \u2014YV: That was Einstein, actually \u2014BG: During your talk you mentioned Singapore and China, and last night at the speaker dinner, you expressed a pretty strong opinion about how the West looks at China. Would you like to share that?YV: Well, there's a great degree of hypocrisy. In our liberal democracies, we have a semblance of democracy. It's because we have confined, as I was saying in my talk, democracy to the political sphere, while leaving the one sphere where all the action is \u2014 the economic sphere \u2014 a completely democracy-free zone.In a sense, if I am allowed to be provocative, China today is closer to Britain in the 19th century. Because remember, we tend to associate liberalism with democracy \u2014 that's a mistake, historically. Liberalism, liberal, it's like John Stuart Mill. John Stuart Mill was particularly skeptical about the democratic process. So what you are seeing now in China is a very similar process to the one that we had in Britain during the Industrial Revolution, especially the transition from the first to the second. And to be castigating China for doing that which the West did in the 19th century, smacks of hypocrisy.BG: I am sure that many people here are wondering about your experience as the Finance Minister of Greece earlier this year.YV: I knew this was coming.BG: Yes.BG: Six months after, how do you look back at the first half of the year?YV: Extremely exciting, from a personal point of view, and very disappointing, because we had an opportunity to reboot the Eurozone. Not just Greece, the Eurozone. To move away from the complacency and the constant denial that there was a massive \u2014 and there is a massive architectural fault line going through the Eurozone, which is threatening, massively, the whole of the European Union process.We had an opportunity on the basis of the Greek program \u2014 which by the way, was the first program to manifest that denial \u2014 to put it right. And, unfortunately, the powers in the Eurozone, in the Eurogroup, chose to maintain denial.But you know what happens. This is the experience of the Soviet Union. When you try to keep alive an economic system that architecturally cannot survive, through political will and through authoritarianism, you may succeed in prolonging it, but when change happens it happens very abruptly and catastrophically.BG: What kind of change are you foreseeing?YV: Well, there's no doubt that if we don't change the architecture of the Eurozone, the Eurozone has no future.BG: Did you make any mistakes when you were Finance Minister?YV: Every day.BG: For example? YV: Anybody who looks back \u2014(Applause)No, but seriously. If there's any Minister of Finance, or of anything else for that matter, who tells you after six months in a job, especially in such a stressful situation, that they have made no mistake, they're dangerous people. Of course I made mistakes.The greatest mistake was to sign the application for the extension of a loan agreement in the end of February. I was imagining that there was a genuine interest on the side of the creditors to find common ground. And there wasn't. They were simply interested in crushing our government, just because they did not want to have to deal with the architectural fault lines that were running through the Eurozone. And because they didn't want to admit that for five years they were implementing a catastrophic program in Greece. We lost one-third of our nominal GDP. This is worse than the Great Depression. And no one has come clean from the troika of lenders that have been imposing this policy to say, \"This was a colossal mistake.\"BG: Despite all this, and despite the aggressiveness of the discussion, you seem to be remaining quite pro-European.YV: Absolutely. Look, my criticism of the European Union and the Eurozone comes from a person who lives and breathes Europe. My greatest fear is that the Eurozone will not survive. Because if it doesn't, the centrifugal forces that will be unleashed will be demonic, and they will destroy the European Union. And that will be catastrophic not just for Europe but for the whole global economy.We are probably the largest economy in the world. And if we allow ourselves to fall into a route of the postmodern 1930's, which seems to me to be what we are doing, then that will be detrimental to the future of Europeans and non-Europeans alike.BG: We definitely hope you are wrong on that point.

doubt\n\n00:00:48.598 --> 00:00:52.494\nthat it is perfectly possible\nto have a flourishing capitalism,\n\n00:00:52.518 --> 00:00:54.118\nspectacular growth,\n\n00:00:54.918 --> 00:00:57.974\nwhile politics remains democracy-free.\n\n00:00:57.998 --> 00:01:02.414\nIndeed, democracy is receding\nin our neck of the woods,\n\n00:01:02.438 --> 00:01:04.014\nhere in Europe.\n\n00:01:04.038 --> 00:01:07.414\nEarlier this year,\nwhile I was representing Greece --\n\n00:01:07.438 --> 00:01:10.174\nthe newly elected Greek government --\n\n00:01:10.198 --> 00:01:12.894\nin the Eurogroup as its Finance Minister,\n\n00:01:12.918 --> 00:01:17.854\nI was told in no uncertain terms\nthat our nation's democratic process --\n\n00:01:17.878 --> 00:01:19.294\nour elections --\n\n00:01:19.318 --> 00:01:21.094\ncould not be allowed to interfere\n\n00:01:21.118 --> 00:01:24.358\nwith economic policies\nthat were being implemented in Greece.\n\n00:01:25.078 --> 00:01:26.294\nAt that moment,\n\n00:01:26.318 --> 00:01:30.614\nI felt that there could be no greater\nvindication of Lee Kuan Yew,\n\n00:01:30.638 --> 00:01:32.174\nor the Chinese Communist Party,\n\n00:01:32.198 --> 00:01:35.934\nindeed of some recalcitrant\nfriends of mine who kept telling me\n\n00:01:35.958 --> 00:01:40.278\nthat democracy would be banned\nif it ever threatened to change anything.\n\n00:01:41.598 --> 00:01:44.854\nTonight, here, I want to present to you\n\n00:01:44.878 --> 00:01:48.038\nan economic case\nfor an authentic democracy.\n\n00:01:48.558 --> 00:01:53.414\nI want to ask you\nto join me in believing again\n\n00:01:53.438 --> 00:01:55.438\nthat Lee Kuan Yew,\n\n00:01:56.438 --> 00:01:57.814\nthe Chinese Communist Party\n\n00:01:57.838 --> 00:01:59.214\nand indeed the Eurogroup\n\n00:01:59.238 --> 00:02:02.878\nare wrong in believing\nthat we can dispense with democracy --\n\n00:02:03.558 --> 00:02:07.294\nthat we need an authentic,\nboisterous democracy.\n\n00:02:07.318 --> 00:02:10.294\nAnd without democracy,\n\n00:02:10.318 --> 00:02:13.174\nour societies will be nastier,\n\n00:02:13.198 --> 00:02:15.334\nour future bleak\n\n00:02:15.358 --> 00:02:18.174\nand our great, new technologies wasted.\n\n00:02:18.198 --> 00:02:19.454\nSpeaking of waste,\n\n00:02:19.478 --> 00:02:22.253\nallow me to point out\nan interesting paradox\n\n00:02:22.278 --> 00:02:25.054\nthat is threatening\nour economies as we speak.\n\n00:02:25.078 --> 00:02:27.374\nI call it the twin peaks paradox.\n\n00:02:27.398 --> 00:02:28.694\nOne peak you understand --\n\n00:02:28.718 --> 00:02:30.334\nyou know it, you recognize it --\n\n00:02:30.358 --> 00:02:35.414\nis the mountain of debts\nthat has been casting a long shadow\n\n00:02:35.438 --> 00:02:38.254\nover the United States,\nEurope, the whole world.\n\n00:02:38.278 --> 00:02:40.158\nWe all recognize the mountain of debts.\n\n00:02:40.838 --> 00:02:44.958\nBut few people discern its twin.\n\n00:02:45.598 --> 00:02:47.798\nA mountain of idle cash\n\n00:02:48.798 --> 00:02:52.158\nbelonging to rich savers\nand to corporations,\n\n00:02:53.078 --> 00:02:55.654\ntoo terrified to invest it\n\n00:02:55.678 --> 00:02:58.974\ninto the productive activities\nthat can generate the incomes\n\n00:02:58.998 --> 00:03:02.054\nfrom which you can extinguish\nthe mountain of debts\n\n00:03:02.078 --> 00:03:06.054\nand which can produce all those things\nthat humanity desperately needs,\n\n00:03:06.078 --> 00:03:07.734\nlike green energy.\n\n00:03:07.758 --> 00:03:10.094\nNow let me give you two numbers.\n\n00:03:10.118 --> 00:03:11.454\nOver the last three months,\n\n00:03:11.478 --> 00:03:14.254\nin the United States,\nin Britain and in the Eurozone,\n\n00:03:14.278 --> 00:03:18.694\nwe have invested, collectively,\n3.4 trillion dollars\n\n00:03:18.718 --> 00:03:21.374\non all the wealth-producing goods --\n\n00:03:21.398 --> 00:03:24.414\nthings like industrial plants, machinery,\n\n00:03:24.438 --> 00:03:26.654\noffice blocks, schools,\n\n00:03:26.678 --> 00:03:29.814\nroads, railways, machinery,\nand so on and so forth.\n\n00:03:29.838 --> 00:03:32.574\n$3.4 trillion sounds like a lot of money\n\n00:03:32.598 --> 00:03:36.454\nuntil you compare it to the $5.1 trillion\n\n00:03:36.478 --> 00:03:39.174\nthat has been slushing around\nin the same countries,\n\n00:03:39.198 --> 00:03:41.014\nin our financial institutions,\n\n00:03:41.038 --> 00:03:44.238\ndoing absolutely nothing\nduring the same period\n\n00:03:45.398 --> 00:03:50.254\nexcept inflating stock exchanges\nand bidding up house prices.\n\n00:03:50.278 --> 00:03:55.534\nSo a mountain of debt\nand a mountain of idle cash\n\n00:03:55.558 --> 00:03:59.254\nform twin peaks, \nfailing to cancel each other out\n\n00:03:59.278 --> 00:04:02.094\nthrough the normal\noperation of the markets.\n\n00:04:02.118 --> 00:04:04.438\nThe result is stagnant wages,\n\n00:04:05.318 --> 00:04:10.974\nmore than a quarter of 25- to 54-year-olds\nin America, in Japan and in Europe\n\n00:04:10.998 --> 00:04:12.494\nout of work.\n\n00:04:12.518 --> 00:04:14.854\nAnd consequently, low aggregate demand,\n\n00:04:14.878 --> 00:04:17.094\nwhich in a never-ending cycle,\n\n00:04:17.118 --> 00:04:19.838\nreinforces the pessimism of the investors,\n\n00:04:20.838 --> 00:04:24.654\nwho, fearing low demand,\nreproduce it by not investing --\n\n00:04:24.678 --> 00:04:27.374\nexactly like Oedipus' father,\n\n00:04:27.398 --> 00:04:29.893\nwho, terrified\nby the prophecy of the oracle\n\n00:04:29.917 --> 00:04:32.654\nthat his son would grow up to kill him,\n\n00:04:32.678 --> 00:04:34.614\nunwittingly engineered the conditions\n\n00:04:34.638 --> 00:04:37.638\nthat ensured that Oedipus,\nhis son, would kill him.\n\n00:04:38.518 --> 00:04:40.518\nThis is my quarrel with capitalism.\n\n00:04:41.158 --> 00:04:43.174\nIts gross wastefulness,\n\n00:04:43.198 --> 00:04:44.814\nall this idle cash,\n\n00:04:44.838 --> 00:04:48.934\nshould be energized to improve lives,\n\n00:04:48.958 --> 00:04:50.294\nto develop human talents,\n\n00:04:50.318 --> 00:04:53.174\nand indeed to finance\nall these technologies,\n\n00:04:53.198 --> 00:04:54.454\ngreen technologies,\n\n00:04:54.478 --> 00:04:57.238\nwhich are absolutely essential\nfor saving planet Earth.\n\n00:04:58.238 --> 00:05:01.494\nAm I right in believing\nthat democracy might be the answer?\n\n00:05:01.518 --> 00:05:02.734\nI believe so,\n\n00:05:02.758 --> 00:05:03.974\nbut before we move on,\n\n00:05:03.998 --> 00:05:05.398\nwhat do we mean by democracy?\n\n00:05:06.478 --> 00:05:08.894\nAristotle defined democracy\n\n00:05:08.918 --> 00:05:13.854\nas the constitution\nin which the free and the poor,\n\n00:05:13.878 --> 00:05:16.038\nbeing in the majority, control government.\n\n00:05:16.958 --> 00:05:20.254\nNow, of course Athenian democracy\nexcluded too many.\n\n00:05:20.278 --> 00:05:23.318\nWomen, migrants and,\nof course, the slaves.\n\n00:05:23.998 --> 00:05:25.254\nBut it would be a mistake\n\n00:05:25.278 --> 00:05:28.854\nto dismiss the significance\nof ancient Athenian democracy\n\n00:05:28.878 --> 00:05:30.878\non the basis of whom it excluded.\n\n00:05:31.638 --> 00:05:32.894\nWhat was more pertinent,\n\n00:05:32.918 --> 00:05:36.774\nand continues to be so\nabout ancient Athenian democracy,\n\n00:05:36.798 --> 00:05:40.294\nwas the inclusion of the working poor,\n\n00:05:40.318 --> 00:05:45.014\nwho not only acquired\nthe right to free speech,\n\n00:05:45.038 --> 00:05:47.294\nbut more importantly, crucially,\n\n00:05:47.318 --> 00:05:49.934\nthey acquired the rights\nto political judgments\n\n00:05:49.958 --> 00:05:52.334\nthat were afforded equal weight\n\n00:05:52.358 --> 00:05:56.014\nin the decision-making\nconcerning matters of state.\n\n00:05:56.038 --> 00:05:59.094\nNow, of course, Athenian\ndemocracy didn't last long.\n\n00:05:59.118 --> 00:06:03.534\nLike a candle that burns brightly,\nit burned out quickly.\n\n00:06:03.558 --> 00:06:04.774\nAnd indeed,\n\n00:06:04.798 --> 00:06:09.054\nour liberal democracies today\ndo not have their roots in ancient Athens.\n\n00:06:09.078 --> 00:06:11.414\nThey have their roots in the Magna Carta,\n\n00:06:11.438 --> 00:06:14.694\nin the 1688 Glorious Revolution,\n\n00:06:14.718 --> 00:06:16.934\nindeed in the American constitution.\n\n00:06:16.958 --> 00:06:21.974\nWhereas Athenian democracy\nwas focusing on the masterless citizen\n\n00:06:21.998 --> 00:06:24.278\nand empowering the working poor,\n\n00:06:25.198 --> 00:06:29.374\nour liberal democracies are founded\non the Magna Carta tradition,\n\n00:06:29.398 --> 00:06:32.494\nwhich was, after all,\na charter for masters.\n\n00:06:32.518 --> 00:06:36.814\nAnd indeed, liberal democracy\nonly surfaced when it was possible\n\n00:06:36.838 --> 00:06:40.694\nto separate fully the political sphere\nfrom the economic sphere,\n\n00:06:40.718 --> 00:06:45.774\nso as to confine the democratic process\nfully in the political sphere,\n\n00:06:45.798 --> 00:06:47.654\nleaving the economic sphere --\n\n00:06:47.678 --> 00:06:49.614\nthe corporate world, if you want --\n\n00:06:49.638 --> 00:06:52.318\nas a democracy-free zone.\n\n00:06:53.678 --> 00:06:56.654\nNow, in our democracies today,\n\n00:06:56.678 --> 00:07:00.174\nthis separation of the economic\nfrom the political sphere,\n\n00:07:00.198 --> 00:07:02.454\nthe moment it started happening,\n\n00:07:02.478 --> 00:07:06.774\nit gave rise to an inexorable,\nepic struggle between the two,\n\n00:07:06.798 --> 00:07:10.014\nwith the economic sphere\ncolonizing the political sphere,\n\n00:07:10.038 --> 00:07:11.558\neating into its power.\n\n00:07:12.438 --> 00:07:15.838\nHave you wondered why politicians\nare not what they used to be?\n\n00:07:16.518 --> 00:07:18.934\nIt's not because their DNA\nhas degenerated.\n\n00:07:18.958 --> 00:07:20.574\n(Laughter)\n\n00:07:20.598 --> 00:07:25.214\nIt is rather because one can be\nin government today and not in power,\n\n00:07:25.238 --> 00:07:28.534\nbecause power has migrated\nfrom the political to the economic sphere,\n\n00:07:28.558 --> 00:07:29.798\nwhich is separate.\n\n00:07:31.118 --> 00:07:32.694\nIndeed,\n\n00:07:32.718 --> 00:07:35.014\nI spoke about my quarrel\nwith capitalism.\n\n00:07:35.038 --> 00:07:36.774\nIf you think about it,\n\n00:07:36.798 --> 00:07:40.118\nit is a little bit like\na population of predators,\n\n00:07:41.038 --> 00:07:45.758\nthat are so successful in decimating\nthe prey that they must feed on,\n\n00:07:46.518 --> 00:07:48.654\nthat in the end they starve.\n\n00:07:48.678 --> 00:07:49.894\nSimilarly,\n\n00:07:49.918 --> 00:07:53.614\nthe economic sphere has been colonizing\nand cannibalizing the political sphere\n\n00:07:53.638 --> 00:07:57.014\nto such an extent\nthat it is undermining itself,\n\n00:07:57.038 --> 00:07:58.774\ncausing economic crisis.\n\n00:07:58.798 --> 00:08:00.894\nCorporate power is increasing,\n\n00:08:00.918 --> 00:08:03.134\npolitical goods are devaluing,\n\n00:08:03.158 --> 00:08:04.974\ninequality is rising,\n\n00:08:04.998 --> 00:08:06.574\naggregate demand is falling\n\n00:08:06.598 --> 00:08:12.718\nand CEOs of corporations are too scared\nto invest the cash of their corporations.\n\n00:08:13.478 --> 00:08:20.134\nSo the more capitalism succeeds\nin taking the demos out of democracy,\n\n00:08:20.158 --> 00:08:21.494\nthe taller the twin peaks\n\n00:08:21.518 --> 00:08:25.054\nand the greater the waste\nof human resources\n\n00:08:25.078 --> 00:08:26.518\nand humanity's wealth.\n\n00:08:27.598 --> 00:08:30.454\nClearly, if this is right,\n\n00:08:30.478 --> 00:08:33.534\nwe must reunite the political\nand economic spheres\n\n00:08:33.558 --> 00:08:37.054\nand better do it\nwith a demos being in control,\n\n00:08:37.078 --> 00:08:40.014\nlike in ancient Athens\nexcept without the slaves\n\n00:08:40.038 --> 00:08:42.998\nor the exclusion of women and migrants.\n\n00:08:44.078 --> 00:08:45.814\nNow, this is not an original idea.\n\n00:08:45.838 --> 00:08:48.613\nThe Marxist left\nhad that idea 100 years ago\n\n00:08:48.637 --> 00:08:50.318\nand it didn't go very well, did it?\n\n00:08:50.798 --> 00:08:54.214\nThe lesson that we learned\nfrom the Soviet debacle\n\n00:08:54.238 --> 00:09:00.574\nis that only by a miracle\nwill the working poor be reempowered,\n\n00:09:00.598 --> 00:09:02.574\nas they were in ancient Athens,\n\n00:09:02.598 --> 00:09:06.358\nwithout creating new forms\nof brutality and waste.\n\n00:09:06.918 --> 00:09:08.158\nBut there is a solution:\n\n00:09:08.838 --> 00:09:10.678\neliminate the working poor.\n\n00:09:11.318 --> 00:09:12.574\nCapitalism's doing it\n\n00:09:12.598 --> 00:09:17.478\nby replacing low-wage workers\nwith automata, androids, robots.\n\n00:09:19.038 --> 00:09:20.254\nThe problem is\n\n00:09:20.278 --> 00:09:23.494\nthat as long as the economic\nand the political spheres are separate,\n\n00:09:23.518 --> 00:09:27.838\nautomation makes the twin peaks taller,\n\n00:09:28.598 --> 00:09:30.334\nthe waste loftier\n\n00:09:30.358 --> 00:09:32.414\nand the social conflicts deeper,\n\n00:09:32.438 --> 00:09:33.638\nincluding --\n\n00:09:34.278 --> 00:09:35.814\nsoon, I believe --\n\n00:09:35.838 --> 00:09:37.438\nin places like China.\n\n00:09:38.678 --> 00:09:41.094\nSo we need to reconfigure,\n\n00:09:41.118 --> 00:09:44.774\nwe need to reunite the economic\nand the political spheres,\n\n00:09:44.798 --> 00:09:50.174\nbut we'd better do it\nby democratizing the reunified sphere,\n\n00:09:50.198 --> 00:09:55.894\nlest we end up with\na surveillance-mad hyperautocracy\n\n00:09:55.918 --> 00:09:59.934\nthat makes The Matrix, the movie,\nlook like a documentary.\n\n00:09:59.958 --> 00:10:01.534\n(Laughter)\n\n00:10:01.558 --> 00:10:04.974\nSo the question is not\nwhether capitalism will survive\n\n00:10:04.998 --> 00:10:07.318\nthe technological innovations\nit is spawning.\n\n00:10:07.918 --> 00:10:09.534\nThe more interesting question\n\n00:10:09.558 --> 00:10:15.294\nis whether capitalism will be succeeded\nby something resembling a Matrix dystopia\n\n00:10:15.318 --> 00:10:19.734\nor something much closer\nto a Star Trek-like society,\n\n00:10:19.758 --> 00:10:22.134\nwhere machines serve the humans\n\n00:10:22.158 --> 00:10:26.574\nand the humans expend their energies\nexploring the universe\n\n00:10:26.598 --> 00:10:30.894\nand indulging in long debates\nabout the meaning of life\n\n00:10:30.918 --> 00:10:34.918\nin some ancient, Athenian-like,\nhigh tech agora.\n\n00:10:36.318 --> 00:10:39.758\nI think we can afford to be optimistic.\n\n00:10:41.358 --> 00:10:42.654\nBut what would it take,\n\n00:10:42.678 --> 00:10:44.654\nwhat would it look like\n\n00:10:44.678 --> 00:10:49.558\nto have this Star Trek-like utopia,\ninstead of the Matrix-like dystopia?\n\n00:10:50.198 --> 00:10:51.454\nIn practical terms,\n\n00:10:51.478 --> 00:10:53.214\nallow me to share just briefly,\n\n00:10:53.238 --> 00:10:54.438\na couple of examples.\n\n00:10:55.038 --> 00:10:56.814\nAt the level of the enterprise,\n\n00:10:56.838 --> 00:10:59.174\nimagine a capital market,\n\n00:10:59.198 --> 00:11:01.878\nwhere you earn capital as you work,\n\n00:11:02.838 --> 00:11:08.174\nand where your capital follows you\nfrom one job to another,\n\n00:11:08.198 --> 00:11:09.694\nfrom one company to another,\n\n00:11:09.718 --> 00:11:10.974\nand the company --\n\n00:11:10.998 --> 00:11:14.454\nwhichever one you happen\nto work at at that time --\n\n00:11:14.478 --> 00:11:18.798\nis solely owned by those who happen\nto work in it at that moment.\n\n00:11:19.358 --> 00:11:24.054\nThen all income stems\nfrom capital, from profits,\n\n00:11:24.078 --> 00:11:28.454\nand the very concept\nof wage labor becomes obsolete.\n\n00:11:28.478 --> 00:11:35.094\nNo more separation between those\nwho own but do not work in the company\n\n00:11:35.118 --> 00:11:38.374\nand those who work\nbut do not own the company;\n\n00:11:38.398 --> 00:11:41.598\nno more tug-of-war\nbetween capital and labor;\n\n00:11:42.398 --> 00:11:46.534\nno great gap between\ninvestment and saving;\n\n00:11:46.558 --> 00:11:49.798\nindeed, no towering twin peaks.\n\n00:11:50.558 --> 00:11:52.934\nAt the level of the global\npolitical economy,\n\n00:11:52.958 --> 00:11:54.894\nimagine for a moment\n\n00:11:54.918 --> 00:11:59.894\nthat our national currencies\nhave a free-floating exchange rate,\n\n00:11:59.918 --> 00:12:03.694\nwith a universal,\nglobal, digital currency,\n\n00:12:03.718 --> 00:12:07.734\none that is issued\nby the International Monetary Fund,\n\n00:12:07.758 --> 00:12:08.974\nthe G-20,\n\n00:12:08.998 --> 00:12:11.534\non behalf of all humanity.\n\n00:12:11.558 --> 00:12:12.774\nAnd imagine further\n\n00:12:12.798 --> 00:12:17.134\nthat all international trade\nis denominated in this currency --\n\n00:12:17.158 --> 00:12:18.974\nlet's call it \"the cosmos,\"\n\n00:12:18.998 --> 00:12:20.398\nin units of cosmos --\n\n00:12:21.678 --> 00:12:26.054\nwith every government agreeing\nto be paying into a common fund\n\n00:12:26.078 --> 00:12:31.614\na sum of cosmos units proportional\nto the country's trade deficit,\n\n00:12:31.638 --> 00:12:35.038\nor indeed to a country's trade surplus.\n\n00:12:35.678 --> 00:12:40.894\nAnd imagine that that fund is utilized\nto invest in green technologies,\n\n00:12:40.918 --> 00:12:46.238\nespecially in parts of the world\nwhere investment funding is scarce.\n\n00:12:46.798 --> 00:12:48.374\nThis is not a new idea.\n\n00:12:48.398 --> 00:12:51.734\nIt's what, effectively,\nJohn Maynard Keynes proposed\n\n00:12:51.758 --> 00:12:55.078\nin 1944 at the Bretton Woods Conference.\n\n00:12:56.038 --> 00:12:57.254\nThe problem is\n\n00:12:57.278 --> 00:13:00.574\nthat back then, they didn't have\nthe technology to implement it.\n\n00:13:00.598 --> 00:13:01.814\nNow we do,\n\n00:13:01.838 --> 00:13:07.758\nespecially in the context\nof a reunified political-economic sphere.\n\n00:13:08.598 --> 00:13:11.014\nThe world that I am describing to you\n\n00:13:11.038 --> 00:13:13.494\nis simultaneously libertarian,\n\n00:13:13.518 --> 00:13:18.094\nin that it prioritizes\nempowered individuals,\n\n00:13:18.118 --> 00:13:19.334\nMarxist,\n\n00:13:19.358 --> 00:13:22.574\nsince it will have confined\nto the dustbin of history\n\n00:13:22.598 --> 00:13:25.054\nthe division between capital and labor,\n\n00:13:25.078 --> 00:13:26.638\nand Keynesian,\n\n00:13:27.278 --> 00:13:28.758\nglobal Keynesian.\n\n00:13:30.278 --> 00:13:31.854\nBut above all else,\n\n00:13:31.878 --> 00:13:36.798\nit is a world in which we will be able\nto imagine an authentic democracy.\n\n00:13:37.718 --> 00:13:39.478\nWill such a world dawn?\n\n00:13:40.358 --> 00:13:44.854\nOr shall we descend\ninto a Matrix-like dystopia?\n\n00:13:44.878 --> 00:13:48.998\nThe answer lies in the political choice\nthat we shall be making collectively.\n\n00:13:49.678 --> 00:13:51.294\nIt is our choice,\n\n00:13:51.318 --> 00:13:53.638\nand we'd better make it democratically.\n\n00:13:54.238 --> 00:13:55.494\nThank you.\n\n00:13:55.518 --> 00:13:58.878\n(Applause)\n\n00:14:01.438 --> 00:14:02.638\nBruno Giussani: Yanis ...\n\n00:14:03.838 --> 00:14:08.278\nIt was you who described yourself\nin your bios as a libertarian Marxist.\n\n00:14:10.358 --> 00:14:12.878\nWhat is the relevance\nof Marx's analysis today?\n\n00:14:13.958 --> 00:14:17.294\nYanis Varoufakis: Well, if there was\nany relevance in what I just said,\n\n00:14:17.318 --> 00:14:18.534\nthen Marx is relevant.\n\n00:14:18.558 --> 00:14:22.054\nBecause the whole point of reunifying\nthe political and economic is --\n\n00:14:22.078 --> 00:14:23.294\nif we don't do it,\n\n00:14:23.318 --> 00:14:25.574\nthen technological innovation\nis going to create\n\n00:14:25.598 --> 00:14:27.894\nsuch a massive fall in aggregate demand,\n\n00:14:27.918 --> 00:14:32.694\nwhat Larry Summers\nrefers to as secular stagnation.\n\n00:14:32.718 --> 00:14:35.574\nWith this crisis migrating\nfrom one part of the world,\n\n00:14:35.598 --> 00:14:37.134\nas it is now,\n\n00:14:37.158 --> 00:14:39.854\nit will destabilize\nnot only our democracies,\n\n00:14:39.878 --> 00:14:44.094\nbut even the emerging world that is not\nthat keen on liberal democracy.\n\n00:14:44.118 --> 00:14:47.934\nSo if this analysis holds water,\nthen Marx is absolutely relevant.\n\n00:14:47.958 --> 00:14:49.694\nBut so is Hayek,\n\n00:14:49.718 --> 00:14:51.534\nthat's why I'm a libertarian Marxist,\n\n00:14:51.558 --> 00:14:52.774\nand so is Keynes,\n\n00:14:52.798 --> 00:14:54.694\nso that's why I'm totally confused.\n\n00:14:54.718 --> 00:14:55.934\n(Laughter)\n\n00:14:55.958 --> 00:14:58.014\nBG: Indeed, and possibly we are too, now.\n\n00:14:58.038 --> 00:14:59.334\n(Laughter)\n\n00:14:59.358 --> 00:15:01.334\n(Applause)\n\n00:15:01.358 --> 00:15:04.134\nYV: If you are not confused,\nyou are not thinking, OK?\n\n00:15:04.158 --> 00:15:07.254\nBG: That's a very, very Greek\nphilosopher kind of thing to say --\n\n00:15:07.278 --> 00:15:08.934\nYV: That was Einstein, actually --\n\n00:15:08.958 --> 00:15:11.574\nBG: During your talk\nyou mentioned Singapore and China,\n\n00:15:11.598 --> 00:15:13.654\nand last night at the speaker dinner,\n\n00:15:13.678 --> 00:15:18.854\nyou expressed a pretty strong opinion\nabout how the West looks at China.\n\n00:15:18.878 --> 00:15:20.454\nWould you like to share that?\n\n00:15:20.478 --> 00:15:22.638\nYV: Well, there's a great\ndegree of hypocrisy.\n\n00:15:23.358 --> 00:15:27.654\nIn our liberal democracies,\nwe have a semblance of democracy.\n\n00:15:27.678 --> 00:15:30.414\nIt's because we have confined,\nas I was saying in my talk,\n\n00:15:30.438 --> 00:15:32.094\ndemocracy to the political sphere,\n\n00:15:32.118 --> 00:15:35.574\nwhile leaving the one sphere\nwhere all the action is --\n\n00:15:35.598 --> 00:15:36.814\nthe economic sphere --\n\n00:15:36.838 --> 00:15:38.678\na completely democracy-free zone.\n\n00:15:39.238 --> 00:15:40.494\nIn a sense,\n\n00:15:40.518 --> 00:15:42.718\nif I am allowed to be provocative,\n\n00:15:43.838 --> 00:15:48.254\nChina today is closer to Britain\nin the 19th century.\n\n00:15:48.278 --> 00:15:49.534\nBecause remember,\n\n00:15:49.558 --> 00:15:51.894\nwe tend to associate\nliberalism with democracy --\n\n00:15:51.918 --> 00:15:53.414\nthat's a mistake, historically.\n\n00:15:53.438 --> 00:15:55.974\nLiberalism, liberal,\nit's like John Stuart Mill.\n\n00:15:55.998 --> 00:16:00.694\nJohn Stuart Mill was particularly\nskeptical about the democratic process.\n\n00:16:00.718 --> 00:16:06.094\nSo what you are seeing now in China\nis a very similar process\n\n00:16:06.118 --> 00:16:09.294\nto the one that we had in Britain\nduring the Industrial Revolution,\n\n00:16:09.318 --> 00:16:12.294\nespecially the transition\nfrom the first to the second.\n\n00:16:12.318 --> 00:16:15.614\nAnd to be castigating China\n\n00:16:15.638 --> 00:16:18.774\nfor doing that which the West did\nin the 19th century,\n\n00:16:18.798 --> 00:16:20.118\nsmacks of hypocrisy.\n\n00:16:21.478 --> 00:16:25.134\nBG: I am sure that many people here\nare wondering about your experience\n\n00:16:25.158 --> 00:16:27.894\nas the Finance Minister

--> 00:16:39.774\nand very disappointing,\n\n00:16:39.798 --> 00:16:43.694\nbecause we had an opportunity\nto reboot the Eurozone.\n\n00:16:43.718 --> 00:16:45.814\nNot just Greece, the Eurozone.\n\n00:16:45.838 --> 00:16:48.774\nTo move away from the complacency\n\n00:16:48.798 --> 00:16:51.254\nand the constant denial\nthat there was a massive --\n\n00:16:51.278 --> 00:16:54.134\nand there is a massive\narchitectural fault line\n\n00:16:54.158 --> 00:16:56.334\ngoing through the Eurozone,\n\n00:16:56.358 --> 00:17:00.774\nwhich is threatening, massively,\nthe whole of the European Union process.\n\n00:17:00.798 --> 00:17:03.974\nWe had an opportunity\non the basis of the Greek program --\n\n00:17:03.998 --> 00:17:05.334\nwhich by the way,\n\n00:17:05.358 --> 00:17:09.734\nwas the first program\nto manifest that denial --\n\n00:17:09.758 --> 00:17:10.974\nto put it right.\n\n00:17:10.998 --> 00:17:12.214\nAnd, unfortunately,\n\n00:17:12.238 --> 00:17:14.054\nthe powers in the Eurozone,\n\n00:17:14.078 --> 00:17:15.278\nin the Eurogroup,\n\n00:17:16.037 --> 00:17:18.014\nchose to maintain denial.\n\n00:17:18.037 --> 00:17:19.294\nBut you know what happens.\n\n00:17:19.317 --> 00:17:21.373\nThis is the experience\nof the Soviet Union.\n\n00:17:21.398 --> 00:17:23.893\nWhen you try to keep alive\n\n00:17:23.918 --> 00:17:27.797\nan economic

mistakes.\n\n00:18:11.078 --> 00:18:13.894\nThe greatest mistake\nwas to sign the application\n\n00:18:13.918 --> 00:18:16.014\nfor the extension of a loan agreement\n\n00:18:16.038 --> 00:18:17.654\nin the end of February.\n\n00:18:17.678 --> 00:18:18.894\nI was imagining\n\n00:18:18.918 --> 00:18:21.894\nthat there was a genuine interest\non the side of the

00:18:33.734\nthat were running through the Eurozone.\n\n00:18:33.758 --> 00:18:35.574\nAnd because they didn't want to admit\n\n00:18:35.598 --> 00:18:39.214\nthat for five years they were implementing\na catastrophic program in Greece.\n\n00:18:39.238 --> 00:18:42.134\nWe lost one-third of our nominal GDP.\n\n00:18:42.158 --> 00:18:44.094\nThis is worse than the Great Depression.\n\n00:18:44.118 --> 00:18:45.374\nAnd no one has come clean\n\n00:18:45.398 --> 00:18:48.334\nfrom the troika of lenders\nthat have been imposing this policy\n\n00:18:48.358 -->

not survive.\n\n00:19:11.238 --> 00:19:12.694\nBecause if it doesn't,\n\n00:19:12.718 --> 00:19:15.574\nthe centrifugal forces\nthat will be unleashed\n\n00:19:15.598 --> 00:19:17.294\nwill be

"I'm a marine biologist and an explorer-photographer with National Geographic, but I want to share a secret. This image is totally incorrect, totally incorrect. I see a couple of people crying in the back that I've blown their idea of mermaids. All right, the mermaid is indeed real, but anyone who's gone on a dive will know that the ocean looks more like this. It's because the ocean is this massive filter, and as soon as you start going underwater, you're going to lose your colors, and it's going to get dark and blue very quickly.But we're humans \u2014 we're terrestrial mammals. And we've got trichromatic vision, so we see in red, green and blue, and we're just complete color addicts. We love eye-popping color, and we try to bring this eye-popping color underwater with us.So there's been a long and sordid history of bringing color underwater, and it starts 88 years ago with Bill Longley and Charles Martin, who were trying to take the first underwater color photograph. And they're in there with old-school scuba suits, where you're pumping air down to them, and they've got a pontoon of high-explosive magnesium powder, and the poor people at the surface are not sure when they're going to pull the string when they've got their frame in focus, and \u2014 boom! \u2014 a pound of high explosives would go off so they could put a little bit of light underwater and get an image like this beautiful hogfish. I mean, it's a gorgeous image, but this is not real. They're creating an artificial environment so we can satisfy our own addiction to color.And looking at it the other way, what we've been finding is that instead of bringing color underwater with us, that we've been looking at the blue ocean, and it's a crucible of blue, and these animals living there for millions of years have been evolving all sorts of ways to take in that blue light and give off other colors. And here's just a little sample of what this secret world looks like. It's like an underwater light show.(Music)Again, what we're seeing here is blue light hitting this image. These animals are absorbing the blue light and immediately transforming this light.So if you think about it, the ocean is 71 percent of the planet, and blue light can extend down to almost a 1,000 meters. As we go down underwater, after about 10 meters, all the red is gone. So if you see anything under 10 meters that's red, it's an animal transforming and creating its own red. This is the largest single monochromatic blue environment on our planet.And my gateway into this world of biofluorescence begins with corals. And I want to give a full TED Talk on corals and just how cool these things are. One of the things that they do, one of their miraculous feats, is they produce lots of these fluorescent proteins, fluorescent molecules. And in this coral, it could be making up to 14 percent of its body mass \u2014 could be this fluorescent protein. So you wouldn't be making, like, 14 percent muscle and not using it, so it's likely doing something that has a functional role. And for the last 10, 15 years, this was so special to me, because this molecule has turned out to be one of the most revolutionary tools in biomedical science, and it's allowing us to better see inside ourselves.So, how do I study this? In order to study biofluorescence, we swim at night. And when I started out, I was just using these blue duct-tape filters over my strobe, so I could make sure I'm actually seeing the light that's being transformed by the animals. We're making an exhibit for the Museum of Natural History, and we're trying to show off how great the fluorescent corals are on the reef, and something happened that just blew me away: this. In the middle of our corals, is this green fluorescent fish. It's the first time we've ever seen a green fluorescent fish or any vertebrate for that matter. And we're rubbing our eyes, checking the filters, thinking that somebody's maybe playing a joke on us with the camera, but the eel was real.It was the first green fluorescent eel that we found, and this just changed my trajectory completely. So I had to put down my corals and team up with a fish scientist, John Sparks, and begin a search around the world to see how prevalent this phenomenon is. And fish are much more interesting than corals, because they have really advanced vision, and some of the fish even have, the way that I was photographing it, they have lenses in their eyes that would magnify the fluorescence. So I wanted to seek this out further.So we designed a new set of gear and we're scouring the reefs around the world, looking for fluorescent life. And it's a bit like \"E.T. phone home.\" We're out there swimming with this blue light, and we're looking for a response, for animals to be absorbing the light and transferring this back to us. And eventually, we found our photobombing Kaupichphys eel. It's a really shy, reclusive eel that we know almost nothing about. They're only about the size of my finger, and they spend about 99.9 percent of their time hidden under a rock. But these eels do come out to mate under full-moon nights, and that full-moon night translates underwater to blue. Perhaps they're using this as a way to see each other, quickly find each other, mate, go back into their hole for the next long stint of time. But then we started to find other fluorescent marine life, like this green fluorescent bream, with its, like, racing stripes along its head and its nape, and it's almost camouflaged and fluorescing at the same intensity as the fluorescent coral there.After this fish, we were introduced to this red fluorescent scorpionfish cloaked and hidden on this rock. The only time we've ever seen this, it's either on red fluorescent algae or red fluorescent coral.Later, we found this stealthy green fluorescent lizardfish. These lizardfish come in many varieties, and they look almost exactly alike under white light. But if you look at them under fluorescent light, you see lots of patterns, you can really see the differences among them. And in total \u2014 we just reported this last year \u2014 we found over 200 species of biofluorescent fish.One of my inspirations is French artist and biologist Jean Painlev\u00e9. He really captures this entrepreneuring, creative spirit in biology. He would design his own gear, make his own cameras, and he was fascinated with the seahorse, Hippocampus erectus, and he filmed for the first time the seahorse giving birth. So this is the male seahorse. They were one of the first fish to start swimming upright with their brain above their head. The males give birth, just phenomenal creatures. So he stayed awake for days. He even put this electrical visor on his head that would shock him, so he could capture this moment. Now, I wish I could have shown Painlev\u00e9 the moment where we found biofluorescent seahorses in the exact same species that he was studying. And here's our footage.(Music)They're the most cryptic fish. You could be swimming right on top of them and not see the seahorse. They would blend right into the algae, which would also fluoresce red, but they've got great vision, and they go through this long mating ritual, and perhaps they're using it in that effect.But things got pretty edgy when we found green fluorescence in the stingray, because stingrays are in the Elasmobranch class, which includes ... sharks. So I'm, like, a coral biologist. Somebody's got to go down and check to see if the sharks are fluorescent. And there I am.(Laughter)And I was like, \"Maybe I should go back to corals.\"(Laughter)It turns out that these sharks are not fluorescent. And then we found it. In a deep, dark canyon off the coast of California, we found the first biofluorescent swellshark, right underneath all the surfers. Here it is. They're just about a meter long. It's called a swellshark. And they call them a swellshark because if they're threatened, they can gulp down water and blow up like an inner tube, about twice their size, and wedge themselves under a rock, so they don't get eaten by a predator. And here is our first footage of these biofluorescent swellsharks. Just magnificent \u2014 I mean, they're showing these distinct patterns, and there are areas that are fluorescent and areas that are not fluorescent, but they've also got these twinkling spots on them that are much brighter than other parts of the shark.But this is all beautiful to see. I was like, this is gorgeous. But what does it mean to the shark? Can they see this? And we looked in the literature, and nothing was known about this shark's vision. So I took this shark to eye specialist Ellis Loew at Cornell University, and we found out that this shark sees discretely and acutely in the blue-green interface, probably about 100 times better than we can see in the dark, but they only see blue-green. So what it's doing is taking this blue world and it's absorbing the blue, creating green. It's creating contrast that they can indeed see. So we have a model, showing that it creates an ability for them to see all these patterns. And males and females also have, we're finding, distinct patterns among them.But our last find came really just a few miles from where we are now, in the Solomon Islands. Swimming at night, I encountered the first biofluorescent sea turtle. So now it's going from fish and sharks into reptiles, which, again, this is only one month old, but it shows us that we know almost nothing about this hawksbill turtle's vision. And it makes me think about how much more there is to learn. And here in the Solomon Islands, there's only a few thousand breeding females of this species left, and this is one of the hotspots for them. So it shows us how much we need to really protect these animals while they're still here, and understand them.In thinking about biofluorescence, I wanted to know, how deep does it go? Does this go all the way to the bottom of the ocean? So we started using submarines, and we equipped them with special blue lights on the front here. And we dropped down, and we noticed one important thing \u2014 that as we get down to 1,000 meters, it drops off. There's no biofluorescent marine life down there, below 1,000 meters \u2014 almost nothing, it's just darkness. So it's mainly a shallow phenomenon. And below 1,000 meters, we encountered the bioluminescent zone, where nine out of 10 animals are actually making their own lights and flashing and blinking.As I try to get deeper, this is slapping on a one-person submarine suit \u2014 some people call this my \"Jacques Cousteau meets Woody Allen\" moment.(Laughter)But as we explore down here, I was thinking about: How do we interact with life delicately? Because we're entering a new age of exploration, where we have to take great care, and we have to set examples how we explore. So I've teamed up with roboticist Rob Wood at Harvard University, and we've been designing squishy underwater robot fingers, so we can delicately interact with the marine life down there. The idea is that most of our technologies to explore the deep ocean come from oil and gas and military, who, you know, they're not really caring to be gentle. Some corals could be 1,000 years old. You don't want to just go and crush them with a big claw. So my dream is something like this. At night, I'm in a submarine, I have force-feedback gloves, and I could delicately set up a lab in the front of my submarine, where the squishy robot fingers are delicately collecting and putting things in jars, and we can conduct our research.Back to the powerful applied applications. Here, you're looking at a living brain that's using the DNA of fluorescent marine creatures, this one from jellyfish and corals, to illuminate the living brain and see its connections. It's funny that we're using RGB just to kind of satisfy our own human intuition, so we can see our brains better. And even more mind-blowing, is my close colleague Vincent Pieribone at Yale, who has actually designed and engineered a fluorescent protein that responds to voltage. So he could see when a single neuron fires. You're essentially looking at a portal into consciousness that was designed by marine creatures.So this brings me all back to perspective and relationship. From deep space, our universe looks like a human brain cell, and then here we are in the deep ocean, and we're finding marine creatures and cells that can illuminate the human mind. And it's my hope that with illuminated minds, we could ponder the overarching interconnectedness of all life, and fathom how much more lies in store if we keep our oceans healthy.Thank you.(Applause)", "id": 2414, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:12.696 --> 00:00:15.856\nI'm a marine biologist\nand an

hidden under a rock.\n\n00:05:37.849 --> 00:05:41.970\nBut these eels do come out to mate\nunder full-moon nights,\n\n00:05:41.994 --> 00:05:45.487\nand that full-moon night\ntranslates underwater to blue.\n\n00:05:45.511 --> 00:05:48.041\nPerhaps they're using this\nas a way to see each other,\n\n00:05:48.065 --> 00:05:49.526\nquickly find each other, mate,\n\n00:05:49.550 --> 00:05:53.264\ngo back into their hole\nfor the next long stint of time.\n\n00:05:53.288 --> 00:05:56.168\nBut then we started to find\nother fluorescent marine life,\n\n00:05:56.192 --> 00:05:58.989\nlike this green fluorescent bream,\n\n00:05:59.013 --> 00:06:02.998\nwith its, like, racing stripes\nalong its head and its nape,\n\n00:06:03.022 --> 00:06:07.323\nand it's almost camouflaged\nand fluorescing at the same intensity\n\n00:06:07.347 --> 00:06:09.133\nas the fluorescent coral there.\n\n00:06:10.148 --> 00:06:12.235\nAfter this fish,\n\n00:06:12.259 --> 00:06:16.560\nwe were introduced to this red\nfluorescent scorpionfish\n\n00:06:16.584 --> 00:06:18.727\ncloaked and hidden on this rock.\n\n00:06:18.751 --> 00:06:22.552\nThe only time we've ever seen this,\nit's either on red fluorescent algae\n\n00:06:22.576 --> 00:06:24.251\nor red fluorescent coral.\n\n00:06:24.592 --> 00:06:29.925\nLater, we found this stealthy\ngreen fluorescent lizardfish.\n\n00:06:29.949 --> 00:06:32.037\nThese lizardfish come in many varieties,\n\n00:06:32.061 --> 00:06:35.330\nand they look almost exactly alike\nunder white light.\n\n00:06:35.354 --> 00:06:37.728\nBut if you look at them\nunder fluorescent light,\n\n00:06:37.752 --> 00:06:39.153\nyou see lots of patterns,\n\n00:06:39.177 --> 00:06:41.863\nyou can really see\nthe differences among them.\n\n00:06:41.887 --> 00:06:44.824\nAnd in total -- we just reported\nthis last year --\n\n00:06:44.848 --> 00:06:49.196\nwe found over 200 species\nof biofluorescent fish.\n\n00:06:50.093 --> 00:06:56.019\nOne of my inspirations is French artist\nand biologist Jean Painlev\u00e9.\n\n00:06:56.043 --> 00:07:00.092\nHe really captures this entrepreneuring,\ncreative spirit in biology.\n\n00:07:00.116 --> 00:07:03.919\nHe would design his own gear,\nmake his own cameras,\n\n00:07:03.943 --> 00:07:07.937\nand he was fascinated with the seahorse,\nHippocampus erectus,\n\n00:07:07.961 --> 00:07:11.188\nand he filmed for the first time\nthe seahorse giving birth.\n\n00:07:12.044 --> 00:07:13.596\nSo this is the male seahorse.\n\n00:07:13.620 --> 00:07:18.334\nThey were one of the first fish\nto start swimming upright\n\n00:07:18.358 --> 00:07:19.986\nwith their brain above their head.\n\n00:07:20.010 --> 00:07:21.161\nThe males give birth,\n\n00:07:21.185 --> 00:07:22.605\njust phenomenal creatures.\n\n00:07:24.913 --> 00:07:26.255\nSo he stayed awake for days.\n\n00:07:26.279 --> 00:07:29.454\nHe even put this electrical visor\non his head that would shock him,\n\n00:07:29.478 --> 00:07:31.070\nso he could capture this moment.\n\n00:07:32.754 --> 00:07:34.874\nNow, I wish I could have shown Painlev\u00e9\n\n00:07:34.898 --> 00:07:37.995\nthe moment where we found\nbiofluorescent seahorses\n\n00:07:38.019 --> 00:07:40.718\nin the exact same species\nthat he was studying.\n\n00:07:40.742 --> 00:07:41.956\nAnd here's our footage.\n\n00:07:41.980 --> 00:07:44.807\n(Music)\n\n00:07:46.434 --> 00:07:47.901\nThey're the most cryptic fish.\n\n00:07:47.925 --> 00:07:51.305\nYou could be swimming right on top of them\nand not see the seahorse.\n\n00:07:52.186 --> 00:07:56.694\nThey would blend right into the algae,\nwhich would also fluoresce red,\n\n00:07:56.718 --> 00:07:58.179\nbut they've got great vision,\n\n00:07:58.203 --> 00:08:00.377\nand they go through\nthis long mating ritual,\n\n00:08:00.401 --> 00:08:02.503\nand perhaps they're using it\nin that effect.\n\n00:08:03.605 --> 00:08:06.524\nBut things got pretty edgy\n\n00:08:07.400 --> 00:08:12.413\nwhen we found green\nfluorescence in the stingray,\n\n00:08:12.437 --> 00:08:15.201\nbecause stingrays are\nin the Elasmobranch class,\n\n00:08:15.225 --> 00:08:16.464\nwhich includes ...\n\n00:08:17.033 --> 00:08:18.492\nsharks.\n\n00:08:18.516 --> 00:08:21.714\nSo I'm, like, a coral biologist.\n\n00:08:22.119 --> 00:08:25.564\nSomebody's got to go down and check\nto see if the sharks are fluorescent.\n\n00:08:25.588 --> 00:08:26.850\nAnd there I am.\n\n00:08:26.874 --> 00:08:28.272\n(Laughter)\n\n00:08:28.296 --> 00:08:30.835\nAnd I was like, \"Maybe I should\ngo back to corals.\"\n\n00:08:30.859 --> 00:08:31.891\n(Laughter)\n\n00:08:31.915 --> 00:08:34.311\nIt turns out that these sharks\nare not fluorescent.\n\n00:08:35.431 --> 00:08:36.847\nAnd then we found it.\n\n00:08:36.871 --> 00:08:41.709\nIn a deep, dark canyon\noff the coast of California,\n\n00:08:41.733 --> 00:08:46.170\nwe found the first\nbiofluorescent swellshark,\n\n00:08:46.194 --> 00:08:47.969\nright underneath all the surfers.\n\n00:08:47.993 --> 00:08:49.178\nHere it is.\n\n00:08:49.202 --> 00:08:51.926\nThey're just about a meter long.\nIt's called a swellshark.\n\n00:08:51.950 --> 00:08:54.862\nAnd they call them a swellshark\nbecause if they're threatened,\n\n00:08:54.886 --> 00:08:57.632\nthey can gulp down water\nand blow up like an inner tube,\n\n00:08:57.656 --> 00:08:58.815\nabout twice their size,\n\n00:08:58.839 --> 00:09:03.584\nand wedge themselves under a rock,\nso they don't get eaten by a predator.\n\n00:09:04.116 --> 00:09:08.259\nAnd here is our first footage\nof these biofluorescent swellsharks.\n\n00:09:09.187 --> 00:09:13.908\nJust magnificent -- I mean,\nthey're showing these distinct patterns,\n\n00:09:13.932 --> 00:09:17.505\nand there are areas that are fluorescent\nand areas that are not fluorescent,\n\n00:09:17.529 --> 00:09:20.118\nbut they've also got these\ntwinkling spots on them\n\n00:09:20.142 --> 00:09:22.733\nthat are much brighter\nthan other parts of the shark.\n\n00:09:22.757 --> 00:09:25.284\nBut this is all beautiful to see.\n\n00:09:25.308 --> 00:09:26.938\nI was like, this is gorgeous.\n\n00:09:26.962 --> 00:09:29.793\nBut what does it mean to the shark?\n\n00:09:29.817 --> 00:09:31.164\nCan they see this?\n\n00:09:31.188 --> 00:09:32.720\nAnd we looked in the literature,\n\n00:09:32.744 --> 00:09:35.902\nand nothing was known\nabout this shark's vision.\n\n00:09:35.926 --> 00:09:40.108\nSo I took this shark to eye specialist\nEllis Loew at Cornell University,\n\n00:09:40.132 --> 00:09:43.655\nand we found out that this shark\nsees discretely and acutely\n\n00:09:43.679 --> 00:09:45.773\nin the blue-green interface,\n\n00:09:45.797 --> 00:09:48.627\nprobably about 100 times better\nthan we can see in the dark,\n\n00:09:48.651 --> 00:09:50.377\nbut they only see blue-green.\n\n00:09:50.401 --> 00:09:53.520\nSo what it's doing\nis taking this blue world\n\n00:09:53.544 --> 00:09:56.297\nand it's absorbing the blue,\ncreating green.\n\n00:09:56.321 --> 00:09:59.139\nIt's creating contrast\nthat they can indeed see.\n\n00:09:59.163 --> 00:10:00.314\nSo we have a model,\n\n00:10:00.338 --> 00:10:03.710\nshowing that it creates an ability\nfor them to see all these patterns.\n\n00:10:03.734 --> 00:10:06.615\nAnd males and females\nalso have, we're finding,\n\n00:10:06.639 --> 00:10:08.575\ndistinct patterns among them.\n\n00:10:09.234 --> 00:10:14.667\nBut our last find came really just\na few miles from where we are now,\n\n00:10:14.691 --> 00:10:16.142\nin the Solomon Islands.\n\n00:10:16.166 --> 00:10:20.626\nSwimming at night, I encountered\nthe first biofluorescent sea turtle.\n\n00:10:20.650 --> 00:10:24.062\nSo now it's going from fish\nand sharks into reptiles,\n\n00:10:24.086 --> 00:10:27.370\nwhich, again, this is only one month old,\n\n00:10:27.394 --> 00:10:29.772\nbut it shows us\nthat we know almost nothing\n\n00:10:29.796 --> 00:10:32.070\nabout this hawksbill turtle's vision.\n\n00:10:32.094 --> 00:10:34.950\nAnd it makes me think about\nhow much more there is to learn.\n\n00:10:34.974 --> 00:10:36.506\nAnd here in the Solomon Islands,\n\n00:10:36.530 --> 00:10:40.101\nthere's only a few thousand\nbreeding females of this species left,\n\n00:10:40.125 --> 00:10:42.169\nand this is one of the hotspots for them.\n\n00:10:42.193 --> 00:10:45.260\nSo it shows us how much we need\nto really protect these animals\n\n00:10:45.284 --> 00:10:47.640\nwhile they're still here,\nand understand them.\n\n00:10:47.664 --> 00:10:49.808\nIn thinking about biofluorescence,\n\n00:10:49.832 --> 00:10:51.777\nI wanted to know, how deep does it go?\n\n00:10:51.801 --> 00:10:54.245\nDoes this go all the way\nto the bottom of the ocean?\n\n00:10:54.269 --> 00:10:57.816\nSo we started using submarines,\nand we equipped them\n\n00:10:57.840 --> 00:11:00.014\nwith special blue lights\non the front here.\n\n00:11:00.038 --> 00:11:01.998\nAnd we dropped down,\n\n00:11:02.022 --> 00:11:04.739\nand we noticed one important thing --\n\n00:11:04.763 --> 00:11:08.061\nthat as we get down to 1,000 meters,\n\n00:11:08.085 --> 00:11:09.401\nit drops off.\n\n00:11:09.425 --> 00:11:13.329\nThere's no biofluorescent marine life\ndown there, below 1,000 meters --\n\n00:11:13.353 --> 00:11:15.358\nalmost nothing, it's just darkness.\n\n00:11:15.382 --> 00:11:17.812\nSo it's mainly a shallow phenomenon.\n\n00:11:17.836 --> 00:11:19.289\nAnd below 1,000 meters,\n\n00:11:19.313 --> 00:11:21.974\nwe encountered the bioluminescent zone,\n\n00:11:21.998 --> 00:11:25.335\nwhere nine out of 10 animals\nare actually making their own lights\n\n00:11:25.359 --> 00:11:27.113\nand flashing and blinking.\n\n00:11:27.137 --> 00:11:28.510\nAs I try to get deeper,\n\n00:11:28.534 --> 00:11:31.509\nthis is slapping on a one-person\nsubmarine suit --\n\n00:11:31.533 --> 00:11:35.296\nsome people call this my \"Jacques Cousteau\nmeets Woody Allen\" moment.\n\n00:11:35.320 --> 00:11:36.471\n(Laughter)\n\n00:11:36.495 --> 00:11:38.546\nBut as we explore down here,\n\n00:11:38.570 --> 00:11:42.289\nI was thinking about: How do we\ninteract with life delicately?\n\n00:11:42.313 --> 00:11:45.010\nBecause we're entering\na new age of exploration,\n\n00:11:45.034 --> 00:11:46.837\nwhere we have to take great care,\n\n00:11:46.861 --> 00:11:49.556\nand we have to set examples\nhow we explore.\n\n00:11:49.580 --> 00:11:53.244\nSo I've teamed up with roboticist Rob Wood\nat Harvard University,\n\n00:11:53.268 --> 00:11:57.407\nand we've been designing\nsquishy underwater robot fingers,\n\n00:11:58.318 --> 00:12:01.420\nso we can delicately interact\nwith the marine life down there.\n\n00:12:01.444 --> 00:12:06.159\nThe idea is that most of our technologies\nto explore the deep ocean\n\n00:12:06.183 --> 00:12:08.963\ncome from oil and gas and military,\n\n00:12:08.987 --> 00:12:11.828\nwho, you know, they're not really\ncaring to be gentle.\n\n00:12:11.852 --> 00:12:14.535\nSome corals could be 1,000 years old.\n\n00:12:14.559 --> 00:12:17.668\nYou don't want to just go\nand crush them with a big claw.\n\n00:12:17.692 --> 00:12:19.690\nSo my dream is something like this.\n\n00:12:19.714 --> 00:12:22.010\nAt night, I'm in a submarine,\n\n00:12:22.034 --> 00:12:24.144\nI have force-feedback gloves,\n\n00:12:24.168 --> 00:12:27.486\nand I could delicately set up\na lab in the front of my submarine,\n\n00:12:27.510 --> 00:12:30.049\nwhere the squishy robot fingers\n\n00:12:30.073 --> 00:12:32.558\nare delicately collecting\nand putting things in jars,\n\n00:12:32.582 --> 00:12:34.167\nand we can conduct our research.\n\n00:12:34.565 --> 00:12:37.415\nBack to the powerful applied applications.\n\n00:12:37.439 --> 00:12:40.279\nHere, you're looking at a living brain\n\n00:12:40.303 --> 00:12:43.670\nthat's using the DNA\nof fluorescent marine creatures,\n\n00:12:43.694 --> 00:12:45.700\nthis one from jellyfish and corals,\n\n00:12:45.724 --> 00:12:49.193\nto illuminate the living brain\nand see its connections.\n\n00:12:49.217 --> 00:12:50.733\nIt's funny that we're using RGB\n\n00:12:50.757 --> 00:12:53.305\njust to kind of satisfy\nour own human intuition,\n\n00:12:53.329 --> 00:12:55.663\nso we can see our brains better.\n\n00:12:55.687 --> 00:12:57.735\nAnd even more mind-blowing,\n\n00:12:57.759 --> 00:13:00.869\nis my close colleague\nVincent Pieribone at Yale,\n\n00:13:00.893 --> 00:13:04.270\nwho has actually designed and engineered\na fluorescent protein\n\n00:13:04.294 --> 00:13:06.389\nthat responds to voltage.\n\n00:13:06.413 --> 00:13:09.515\nSo he could see\nwhen a single neuron fires.\n\n00:13:09.539 --> 00:13:14.078\nYou're essentially looking at\na portal into consciousness\n\n00:13:14.102 --> 00:13:17.016\nthat was designed by marine creatures.\n\n00:13:18.060 --> 00:13:22.746\nSo this brings me all back\nto perspective and relationship.\n\n00:13:22.770 --> 00:13:25.009\nFrom deep space,\n\n00:13:25.033 --> 00:13:28.185\nour universe looks\nlike a human brain cell,\n\n00:13:28.209 --> 00:13:30.691\nand then here we are in the deep ocean,\n\n00:13:30.715 --> 00:13:33.586\nand we're finding\nmarine creatures and cells\n\n00:13:33.610 --> 00:13:35.889\nthat can illuminate the human mind.\n\n00:13:35.913 --> 00:13:39.031\nAnd it's my hope\nthat with illuminated minds,\n\n00:13:39.055 --> 00:13:42.840\nwe could ponder the overarching\ninterconnectedness of all life,\n\n00:13:42.864 --> 00:13:45.222\nand fathom how much more lies in store\n\n00:13:45.246 --> 00:13:46.961\nif we keep our oceans healthy.\n\n00:13:46.985 --> 00:13:48.143\nThank you.\n\n00:13:48.167 --> 00:13:53.283\n(Applause)"}, {"title": "Should you be able to patent a human gene?", "duration": "1085", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/tania_simoncelli_should_you_be_able_to_patent_a_human_gene", "transcript": "It was an afternoon in the fall of 2005. I was working at the ACLU as the organization's science advisor. I really, really loved my job, but I was having one of those days where I was feeling just a little bit discouraged.So I wandered down the hallway to my colleague Chris Hansen's office. Chris had been at the ACLU for more than 30 years, so he had deep institutional knowledge and insights.I explained to Chris that I was feeling a little bit stuck. I had been investigating a number of issues at the intersection of science and civil liberties \u2014 super interesting. But I wanted the ACLU to engage these issues in a much bigger way, in a way that could really make a difference.So Chris cut right to the chase, and he says, \"Well, of all the issues you've been looking at, what are the top five?\"\"Well, there's genetic discrimination, and reproductive technologies, and biobanking, and ... oh, there's this really cool issue, functional MRI and using it for lie detection, and ... oh, and of course, there's gene patents.\"\"Gene patents?\"\"Yes, you know, patents on human genes.\"\"No! You're telling me that the US government has been issuing patents on part of the human body? That can't be right.\"I went back to my office and sent Chris three articles. And 20 minutes later, he came bursting in my office. \"Oh my god! You're right! Who can we sue?\"(Laughter)Now Chris is a really brilliant lawyer, but he knew almost nothing about patent law and certainly nothing about genetics. I knew something about genetics, but I wasn't even a lawyer, let alone a patent lawyer. So clearly we had a lot to learn before we could file a lawsuit.First, we needed to understand exactly what was patented when someone patented a gene. Gene patents typically contain dozens of claims, but the most controversial of these are to so-called \"isolated DNA\" \u2014 namely, a piece of DNA that has been removed from a cell.Gene patent proponents say, \"See? We didn't patent the gene in your body, we patented an isolated gene.\" And that's true, but the problem is that any use of the gene requires that it be isolated. And the patents weren't just to a particular gene that they isolated, but on every possible version of that gene.So what does that mean?That means that you can't give your gene to your doctor and ask him or her to look at it, say, to see if it has any mutations, without permission of the patent holder. It also means that the patent holder has the right to stop anyone from using that gene in research or clinical testing. Allowing patent holders, often private companies, to lock up stretches of the human genome was harming patients.Consider Abigail, a 10-year-old with long QT syndrome, a serious heart condition that, if left untreated, can result in sudden death. The company that obtained a patent on two genes associated with this condition developed a test to diagnose the syndrome. But then they went bankrupt and they never offered it. So another lab tried to offer the test, but the company that held the patents threatened to sue the lab for patent infringement. So as a result, for 2 years, no test was available. During that time, Abigail died of undiagnosed long QT.Gene patents clearly were a problem and were harming patients. But was there a way we could challenge them?Turns out that the Supreme Court has made clear through a long line of cases, that certain things are not patent eligible. You can't patent products of nature \u2014 the air, the water, minerals, elements of the periodic table. And you can't patent laws of nature \u2014 the law of gravity, E = mc2. These things are just too fundamental and must remain free to all and reserved exclusively to none.It seemed to us that DNA, the most fundamental structure of life, that codes for the production of all of our proteins, is both a product of nature and a law of nature, regardless of whether it's in our bodies or sitting in the bottom of a test tube.As we delved into this issue, we traveled all over the country to speak with many different experts \u2014 scientists, medical professionals, lawyers, patent lawyers. Most of them agreed that we were right as a matter of policy, and, at least in theory, as a matter of law. All of them thought our chances of winning a gene-patent challenge were about zero.Why is that? Well, the patent office had been issuing these patents for more than 20 years. There were literally thousands of patents on human genes. The patent bar was deeply entrenched in the status quo, the biotech industry had grown up around this practice, and legislation to ban gene patents had been introduced year after year in Congress, and had gone absolutely nowhere. So the bottom line: courts just weren't going to be willing to overturn these patents.Now, neither Chris nor I were the type to shy away from a challenge, and hearing, \"Being right just isn't enough,\" seemed all the more reason to take on this fight. So we set out to build our case.Now, patent cases tend to be: Company A sues Company B over some really narrow, obscure technical issue. We weren't really interested in that kind of case, and we thought this case was much bigger than that. This was about scientific freedom, medical progress, the rights of patients. So we decided we were going to develop a case that was not like your typical patent case \u2014 more like a civil rights case.We set out to identify a gene-patent holder that was vigorously enforcing its patents and then to organize a broad coalition of plaintiffs and experts that could tell the court about all the ways that these patents were harming patients and innovation.We found the prime candidate to sue in Myriad Genetics, a company that's based in Salt Lake City, Utah. Myriad held patents on two genes, the BRCA1 and the BRCA2 genes. Women with certain mutations along these genes are considered to be at a significantly increased risk of developing breast and ovarian cancer. Myriad had used its patents to maintain a complete monopoly on BRCA testing in the United States. It had forced multiple labs that were offering BRCA testing to stop. It charged a lot of money for its test \u2014 over 3,000 dollars. It had stopped sharing its clinical data with the international scientific community. And perhaps worst of all, for a period of several years, Myriad refused to update its test to include additional mutations that had been identified by a team of researchers in France.It has been estimated that during that period, for several years, as many as 12 percent of women undergoing testing received the wrong answer \u2014 a negative test result that should have been positive.This is Kathleen Maxian. Kathleen's sister Eileen developed breast cancer at age 40 and she was tested by Myriad. The test was negative. The family was relieved. That meant that Eileen's cancer most likely didn't run in the family, and that other members of her family didn't need to be tested. But two years later, Kathleen was diagnosed with advanced-stage ovarian cancer. It turned out that Kathleen's sister was among the 12 percent who received a false-negative test result. Had Eileen received the proper result, Kathleen would have then been tested, and her ovarian cancer could have been prevented.Once we settled on Myriad, we then had to form a coalition of plaintiffs and experts that could illuminate these problems. We ended up with 20 highly committed plaintiffs: genetic counselors, geneticists who had received cease and desist letters, advocacy organizations, four major scientific organizations that collectively represented more than 150,000 scientists and medical professionals, and individual women who either couldn't afford Myriad's test, or who wanted to obtain a second opinion but could not, as a result of the patents.One of the major challenges we had in preparing the case was figuring out how best to communicate the science. So in order to argue that what Myriad did was not an invention, and that isolated BRCA genes were products of nature, we had to explain a couple of basic concepts, like: What's a gene? What's DNA? How is DNA isolated, and why isn't that an invention?We spent hours and hours with our plaintiffs and experts, trying to come up with ways of explaining these concepts simply yet accurately. And we ended up relying heavily on the use of metaphors, like gold.So isolating DNA \u2014 it's like extracting gold from a mountain or taking it out of a stream bed. You might be able to patent the process for mining the gold, but you can't patent the gold itself. It might've taken a lot of hard work and effort to dig the gold out of the mountain; you still can't patent it, it's still gold. And the gold, once it's extracted, can clearly be used for all sorts of things that it couldn't be used for when it was in the mountain; you can make jewelry out of it for example \u2014 still can't patent the gold, it's still gold.So now it's 2009, and we're ready to file our case. We filed in federal court in the Southern District of New York, and the case was randomly assigned to Judge Robert Sweet. In March 2010, Judge Sweet issued his opinion \u2014 152 pages \u2014 and a complete victory for our side.In reading the opinion, we could not get over how eloquently he described the science in the case. I mean, our brief \u2014 it was pretty good, but not this good. How did he develop such a deep understanding of this issue in such a short time? We just could not comprehend how this had happened. So it turned out, Judge Sweet's clerk working for him at the time, was not just a lawyer \u2014 he was a scientist. He was not just a scientist \u2014 he had a PhD in molecular biology.(Laughter)What an incredible stroke of luck!Myriad then appealed to the US Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. And here things got really interesting.First, in a pivotal moment of this case, the US government switched sides.So in the district court the government submitted a brief on Myriad's side. But now in direct opposition to its own patent office, the US government files a brief that states that is has reconsidered this issue in light of the district court's opinion, and has concluded that isolated DNA is not patent eligible. This was a really big deal, totally unexpected.The Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit hears all patent cases, and it has a reputation for being very, very pro-patent. So even with this remarkable development, we expected to lose. And we did. Sort of. Ends up split decision, 2 to 1. But the two judges who ruled against us, did so for completely different reasons. The first one, Judge Lourie, made up his own novel, biological theory \u2014 totally wrong.(Laughter)He decided Myriad had created a new chemical \u2014 made absolutely no sense. Myriad didn't even argue this, so it came out of the blue. The other, Judge Moore, said she basically agreed with us that isolated DNA is a product of nature. But she's like, \"I don't want to shake up the biotech industry.\" The third, Judge Bryson, agreed with us.So now we sought review by the Supreme Court. And when you petition the Supreme Court, you have to present a question that you want the Court to answer. Usually these questions take the form of a super-long paragraph, like a whole page long with lots and lots of clauses, \"wherein this\" and \"therefore that.\" We submitted perhaps the shortest question presented ever. Four words: Are human genes patentable?Now when Chris first asked me what I thought of these words, I said, \"Well, I don't know. I think you have to say, 'Is isolated DNA patentable?'\"\"Nope. I want the justices to have the very same reaction that I had when you brought this issue to me seven years ago.\"Well, I certainly couldn't argue with that.The Supreme Court only hears about one percent of the cases that it receives, and it agreed to hear ours. The day of the oral argument arrives, and it was really, really exciting \u2014 long line of people outside, people had been standing in line since 2:30 in the morning to try to get into the courthouse. Two breast cancer organizations, Breast Cancer Action and FORCE, had organized a demonstration on the courthouse steps.Chris and I sat quietly in the hallway, moments before he was to walk in and argue the most important case of his career. I was clearly more nervous than he was. But any remaining panic subsided as I walked into the courtroom and looked around at a sea of friendly faces: our individual women clients who had shared their deeply personal stories, the geneticists who had taken huge chunks of time out of their busy careers to dedicate themselves to this fight and representatives from a diverse array of medical, patient advocacy, environmental and religious organizations, who had submitted friend of the court briefs in the case.Also in the room were three leaders of the Human Genome Project, including the co-discoverer of DNA himself, James Watson, who had submitted a brief to the court, where he referred to gene patenting as \"lunacy.\"(Laughter)The diversity of the communities represented in this room and the contributions each had made to make this day a reality spoke volumes to what was at stake.The argument itself was riveting. Chris argued brilliantly. But for me, the most thrilling aspect was watching the Supreme Court justices grapple with isolated DNA, through a series of colorful analogies and feisty exchanges, very much the same way as our legal team had done for the past seven years. Justice Kagan likened isolating DNA to extracting a medicinal plant from the Amazon. Justice Roberts distinguished it from carving a baseball bat from a tree. And in one of my absolutely favorite moments, Justice Sotomayor proclaimed isolated DNA to be \"just nature sitting there.\"(Laughter)We felt pretty confident leaving the courtroom that day, but I could never have anticipated the outcome: nine to zero.\"A naturally occurring DNA segment is a product of nature, and not patent-eligible merely because it has been isolated. And furthermore, Myriad did not create anything.\"Within 24 hours of the decision, five labs had announced that they would begin to offer testing for the BRCA genes. Some of them promised to offer the tests at a lower price than Myriad's. Some promised to provide a more comprehensive test than the one Myriad was offering.But of course the decision goes far beyond Myriad. It ends a 25-year practice of allowing patents on human genes in the United States. It clears a significant barrier to biomedical discovery and innovation. And it helps to ensure that patients like Abigail, Kathleen and Eileen have access to the tests that they need.A few weeks after the court issued its decision, I received a small package in the mail. It was from Bob Cook-Deegan, a professor at Duke University and one the very first people Chris and I went to visit when we started to consider whether to bring this case. I opened it up to find a small stuffed animal.(Laughter)We took a big risk in taking this case. Part of what gave us the courage to take that risk was knowing that we were doing the right thing. The process took nearly eight years from the start to finish, with many twists and turns along the way. A little luck certainly helped, but it was the communities that we bridged, the alliances that we created, that made pigs fly.Thank you.(Applause)", "id": 2416, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:13.382 --> 00:00:16.540\nIt was an afternoon in the fall of 2005.\n\n00:00:17.283 --> 00:00:20.882\nI was working at the ACLU\nas the organization's science advisor.\n\n00:00:21.346 --> 00:00:23.953\nI really, really loved my job,\n\n00:00:23.977 --> 00:00:25.613\nbut I was having one of those days\n\n00:00:25.637 --> 00:00:28.206\nwhere I was feeling\njust a little bit discouraged.\n\n00:00:29.223 --> 00:00:33.327\nSo I wandered down the hallway\nto my colleague Chris Hansen's office.\n\n00:00:34.325 --> 00:00:37.979\nChris had been at the ACLU\nfor more than 30 years,\n\n00:00:38.003 --> 00:00:41.078\nso he had deep institutional\nknowledge and insights.\n\n00:00:41.598 --> 00:00:44.571\nI explained to Chris\nthat I was feeling a little bit stuck.\n\n00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:47.652\nI had been investigating\na number of issues\n\n00:00:47.676 --> 00:00:52.977\nat the intersection of science\nand civil liberties -- super interesting.\n\n00:00:53.001 --> 00:00:56.911\nBut I wanted the ACLU to engage\nthese issues in a much bigger way,\n\n00:00:56.935 --> 00:00:59.180\nin a way that could really\nmake a difference.\n\n00:01:01.561 --> 00:01:03.661\nSo Chris cut right\nto the chase, and he says,\n\n00:01:03.685 --> 00:01:07.145\n\"Well, of all the issues you've been\nlooking at, what are the top five?\"\n\n00:01:07.482 --> 00:01:10.138\n\"Well, there's genetic discrimination,\n\n00:01:10.162 --> 00:01:12.587\nand reproductive technologies,\n\n00:01:12.611 --> 00:01:14.752\nand biobanking, and ...\n\n00:01:14.776 --> 00:01:16.618\noh, there's this really cool issue,\n\n00:01:16.642 --> 00:01:19.291\nfunctional MRI and using it\nfor lie detection, and ...\n\n00:01:19.315 --> 00:01:21.436\noh, and of course, there's gene patents.\"\n\n00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:23.089\n\"Gene patents?\"\n\n00:01:23.925 --> 00:01:26.007\n\"Yes, you know, patents on human genes.\"\n\n00:01:26.031 --> 00:01:27.537\n\"No!\n\n00:01:27.561 --> 00:01:30.022\nYou're telling me that the US government\n\n00:01:30.046 --> 00:01:32.970\nhas been issuing patents\non part of the human body?\n\n00:01:33.501 --> 00:01:35.184\nThat can't be right.\"\n\n00:01:35.819 --> 00:01:39.278\nI went back to my office\nand sent Chris three articles.\n\n00:01:39.912 --> 00:01:43.239\nAnd 20 minutes later,\nhe came bursting in my office.\n\n00:01:43.263 --> 00:01:46.879\n\"Oh my god! You're right! Who can we sue?\"\n\n00:01:47.288 --> 00:01:48.797\n(Laughter)\n\n00:01:49.671 --> 00:01:52.045\nNow Chris is a really brilliant lawyer,\n\n00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:54.978\nbut he knew almost nothing\nabout patent law\n\n00:01:55.002 --> 00:01:57.438\nand certainly nothing about genetics.\n\n00:01:57.462 --> 00:02:00.340\nI knew something about genetics,\nbut I wasn't even a lawyer,\n\n00:02:00.364 --> 00:02:02.025\nlet alone a patent lawyer.\n\n00:02:02.049 --> 00:02:05.515\nSo clearly we had a lot to learn\nbefore we could file a lawsuit.\n\n00:02:05.994 --> 00:02:08.852\nFirst, we needed to understand\nexactly what was patented\n\n00:02:08.876 --> 00:02:10.557\nwhen someone patented a gene.\n\n00:02:11.637 --> 00:02:15.459\nGene patents typically contain\ndozens of claims,\n\n00:02:15.483 --> 00:02:20.260\nbut the most controversial of these\nare to so-called \"isolated DNA\" --\n\n00:02:20.657 --> 00:02:25.098\nnamely, a piece of DNA\nthat has been removed from a cell.\n\n00:02:26.031 --> 00:02:27.330\nGene patent proponents say,\n\n00:02:27.354 --> 00:02:30.528\n\"See? We didn't patent\nthe gene in your body,\n\n00:02:30.552 --> 00:02:32.487\nwe patented an isolated gene.\"\n\n00:02:33.106 --> 00:02:34.307\nAnd that's true,\n\n00:02:34.331 --> 00:02:41.064\nbut the problem is that any use\nof the gene requires that it be isolated.\n\n00:02:42.468 --> 00:02:46.873\nAnd the patents weren't just\nto a particular gene that they isolated,\n\n00:02:46.897 --> 00:02:49.784\nbut on every possible\nversion of that gene.\n\n00:02:50.141 --> 00:02:51.478\nSo what does that mean?\n\n00:02:51.939 --> 00:02:55.001\nThat means that you can't give\nyour gene to your doctor\n\n00:02:55.025 --> 00:02:57.321\nand ask him or her to look at it,\n\n00:02:57.345 --> 00:02:59.445\nsay, to see if it has any mutations,\n\n00:02:59.469 --> 00:03:01.545\nwithout permission of the patent holder.\n\n00:03:02.321 --> 00:03:06.514\nIt also means that the patent holder\nhas the right to stop anyone\n\n00:03:06.538 --> 00:03:10.020\nfrom using that gene\nin research or clinical testing.\n\n00:03:10.829 --> 00:03:12.527\nAllowing patent holders,\n\n00:03:12.551 --> 00:03:13.835\noften private companies,\n\n00:03:13.859 --> 00:03:18.345\nto lock up stretches of the human genome\nwas harming patients.\n\n00:03:18.916 --> 00:03:20.068\nConsider Abigail,\n\n00:03:20.092 --> 00:03:22.485\na 10-year-old with long QT syndrome,\n\n00:03:22.509 --> 00:03:25.933\na serious heart condition that,\nif left untreated,\n\n00:03:25.957 --> 00:03:27.735\ncan result in sudden death.\n\n00:03:28.869 --> 00:03:32.791\nThe company that obtained a patent on two\ngenes associated with this condition\n\n00:03:32.815 --> 00:03:35.297\ndeveloped a test to diagnose the syndrome.\n\n00:03:35.321 --> 00:03:38.145\nBut then they went bankrupt\nand they never offered it.\n\n00:03:39.018 --> 00:03:40.946\nSo another lab tried to offer the test,\n\n00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:43.958\nbut the company that held the patents\nthreatened to sue the lab\n\n00:03:43.982 --> 00:03:45.164\nfor patent infringement.\n\n00:03:45.188 --> 00:03:46.347\nSo as a result,\n\n00:03:46.371 --> 00:03:49.233\nfor 2 years, no test was available.\n\n00:03:50.249 --> 00:03:51.399\nDuring that time,\n\n00:03:51.423 --> 00:03:54.673\nAbigail died of undiagnosed long QT.\n\n00:03:55.734 --> 00:03:58.971\nGene patents clearly were a problem\nand were harming patients.\n\n00:03:59.425 --> 00:04:01.831\nBut was there a way\nwe could challenge them?\n\n00:04:02.224 --> 00:04:03.956\nTurns out that the Supreme Court\n\n00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:07.094\nhas made clear\nthrough a long line of cases,\n\n00:04:07.118 --> 00:04:09.904\nthat certain things\nare not patent eligible.\n\n00:04:10.883 --> 00:04:13.257\nYou can't patent products of nature --\n\n00:04:14.106 --> 00:04:18.315\nthe air, the water, minerals,\nelements of the periodic table.\n\n00:04:19.128 --> 00:04:21.240\nAnd you can't patent laws of nature --\n\n00:04:22.151 --> 00:04:24.430\nthe law of gravity, E = mc2.\n\n00:04:24.867 --> 00:04:29.673\nThese things are just too fundamental\nand must remain free to all\n\n00:04:29.697 --> 00:04:31.520\nand reserved exclusively to none.\n\n00:04:32.306 --> 00:04:34.453\nIt seemed to us that DNA,\n\n00:04:34.477 --> 00:04:36.993\nthe most fundamental structure of life,\n\n00:04:37.017 --> 00:04:39.673\nthat codes for the production\nof all of our proteins,\n\n00:04:39.697 --> 00:04:42.923\nis both a product of nature\nand a law of nature,\n\n00:04:42.947 --> 00:04:45.649\nregardless of whether it's in our bodies\n\n00:04:45.673 --> 00:04:47.711\nor sitting in the bottom of a test tube.\n\n00:04:48.481 --> 00:04:49.936\nAs we delved into this issue,\n\n00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:53.868\nwe traveled all over the country\nto speak with many different experts --\n\n00:04:54.546 --> 00:04:58.259\nscientists, medical professionals,\nlawyers, patent lawyers.\n\n00:04:58.711 --> 00:05:02.621\nMost of them agreed that we were right\nas a matter of policy,\n\n00:05:02.645 --> 00:05:05.430\nand, at least in theory,\nas a matter of law.\n\n00:05:06.271 --> 00:05:07.426\nAll of them thought\n\n00:05:07.450 --> 00:05:10.020\nour chances of winning\na gene-patent challenge\n\n00:05:10.044 --> 00:05:11.911\nwere about zero.\n\n00:05:13.586 --> 00:05:14.949\nWhy is that?\n\n00:05:14.973 --> 00:05:18.060\nWell, the patent office\nhad been issuing these patents\n\n00:05:18.084 --> 00:05:19.785\nfor more than 20 years.\n\n00:05:20.644 --> 00:05:23.524\nThere were literally thousands\nof patents on human genes.\n\n00:05:24.801 --> 00:05:27.742\nThe patent bar was deeply\nentrenched in the status quo,\n\n00:05:28.539 --> 00:05:32.162\nthe biotech industry had grown up\naround this practice,\n\n00:05:32.186 --> 00:05:35.305\nand legislation to ban gene patents\nhad been introduced\n\n00:05:35.329 --> 00:05:36.727\nyear after year in Congress,\n\n00:05:36.751 --> 00:05:38.542\nand had gone absolutely nowhere.\n\n00:05:39.359 --> 00:05:40.573\nSo the bottom line:\n\n00:05:40.985 --> 00:05:44.160\ncourts just weren't going to be willing\nto overturn these patents.\n\n00:05:44.874 --> 00:05:49.469\nNow, neither Chris nor I were the type\nto shy away from a challenge,\n\n00:05:49.493 --> 00:05:52.637\nand hearing, \"Being right\njust isn't enough,\"\n\n00:05:52.661 --> 00:05:55.191\nseemed all the more reason\nto take on this fight.\n\n00:05:56.269 --> 00:05:58.204\nSo we set out to build our case.\n\n00:05:59.452 --> 00:06:02.942\nNow, patent cases tend to be:\nCompany A sues Company B\n\n00:06:02.966 --> 00:06:06.149\nover some really narrow,\nobscure technical issue.\n\n00:06:06.780 --> 00:06:09.145\nWe weren't really interested\nin that kind of case,\n\n00:06:09.169 --> 00:06:11.558\nand we thought this case\nwas much bigger than that.\n\n00:06:11.582 --> 00:06:14.070\nThis was about scientific freedom,\nmedical progress,\n\n00:06:14.094 --> 00:06:15.553\nthe rights of patients.\n\n00:06:15.577 --> 00:06:18.680\nSo we decided we were going\nto develop a case\n\n00:06:18.704 --> 00:06:21.222\nthat was not like\nyour typical patent case --\n\n00:06:21.603 --> 00:06:23.485\nmore like a civil rights case.\n\n00:06:24.714 --> 00:06:27.556\nWe set out to identify\na gene-patent holder\n\n00:06:27.580 --> 00:06:30.365\nthat was vigorously enforcing its patents\n\n00:06:30.389 --> 00:06:33.683\nand then to organize a broad coalition\nof plaintiffs and experts\n\n00:06:33.707 --> 00:06:35.597\nthat could tell the court\n\n00:06:35.621 --> 00:06:40.010\nabout all the ways that these patents\nwere harming patients and innovation.\n\n00:06:41.362 --> 00:06:44.484\nWe found the prime candidate\nto sue in Myriad Genetics,\n\n00:06:44.508 --> 00:06:47.363\na company that's based\nin Salt Lake City, Utah.\n\n00:06:48.676 --> 00:06:50.926\nMyriad held patents on two genes,\n\n00:06:50.950 --> 00:06:54.271\nthe BRCA1 and the BRCA2 genes.\n\n00:06:55.108 --> 00:06:57.842\nWomen with certain mutations\nalong these genes\n\n00:06:57.866 --> 00:07:00.492\nare considered to be\nat a significantly increased risk\n\n00:07:00.516 --> 00:07:02.461\nof developing breast and ovarian cancer.\n\n00:07:03.792 --> 00:07:05.672\nMyriad had used its patents to maintain\n\n00:07:05.696 --> 00:07:09.905\na complete monopoly on BRCA testing\nin the United States.\n\n00:07:10.502 --> 00:07:14.690\nIt had forced multiple labs\nthat were offering BRCA testing to stop.\n\n00:07:14.714 --> 00:07:16.873\nIt charged a lot of money for its test --\n\n00:07:16.897 --> 00:07:18.580\nover 3,000 dollars.\n\n00:07:19.047 --> 00:07:21.382\nIt had stopped sharing its clinical data\n\n00:07:21.406 --> 00:07:23.693\nwith the international\nscientific community.\n\n00:07:24.480 --> 00:07:26.383\nAnd perhaps worst of all,\n\n00:07:26.407 --> 00:07:28.843\nfor a period of several years,\n\n00:07:28.867 --> 00:07:32.580\nMyriad refused to update its test\nto include additional mutations\n\n00:07:32.604 --> 00:07:36.225\nthat had been identified\nby a team of researchers in France.\n\n00:07:36.932 --> 00:07:39.440\nIt has been estimated\nthat during that period,\n\n00:07:39.464 --> 00:07:40.837\nfor several years,\n\n00:07:40.861 --> 00:07:44.613\nas many as 12 percent of women\nundergoing testing\n\n00:07:44.637 --> 00:07:47.039\nreceived the wrong answer --\n\n00:07:48.335 --> 00:07:52.104\na negative test result\nthat should have been positive.\n\n00:07:53.443 --> 00:07:55.184\nThis is Kathleen Maxian.\n\n00:07:56.130 --> 00:07:59.387\nKathleen's sister Eileen\ndeveloped breast cancer at age 40\n\n00:07:59.411 --> 00:08:01.251\nand she was tested by Myriad.\n\n00:08:01.990 --> 00:08:03.716\nThe test was negative.\n\n00:08:03.740 --> 00:08:05.266\nThe family was relieved.\n\n00:08:05.290 --> 00:08:09.078\nThat meant that Eileen's cancer\nmost likely didn't run in the family,\n\n00:08:09.102 --> 00:08:12.117\nand that other members of her family\ndidn't need to be tested.\n\n00:08:12.801 --> 00:08:14.031\nBut two years later,\n\n00:08:14.055 --> 00:08:18.115\nKathleen was diagnosed\nwith advanced-stage ovarian cancer.\n\n00:08:18.885 --> 00:08:22.757\nIt turned out that Kathleen's sister\nwas among the 12 percent\n\n00:08:22.781 --> 00:08:25.650\nwho received a false-negative test result.\n\n00:08:26.305 --> 00:08:29.394\nHad Eileen received the proper result,\n\n00:08:29.418 --> 00:08:31.791\nKathleen would have then been tested,\n\n00:08:31.815 --> 00:08:34.728\nand her ovarian cancer\ncould have been prevented.\n\n00:08:36.776 --> 00:08:38.040\nOnce we settled on Myriad,\n\n00:08:38.064 --> 00:08:41.949\nwe then had to form a coalition\nof plaintiffs and experts\n\n00:08:41.973 --> 00:08:44.061\nthat could illuminate these problems.\n\n00:08:44.085 --> 00:08:46.657\nWe ended up with 20\nhighly committed plaintiffs:\n\n00:08:47.283 --> 00:08:48.821\ngenetic counselors,\n\n00:08:48.845 --> 00:08:52.204\ngeneticists who had received\ncease and desist letters,\n\n00:08:52.863 --> 00:08:54.712\nadvocacy organizations,\n\n00:08:55.490 --> 00:08:58.555\nfour major scientific organizations\nthat collectively represented\n\n00:08:58.579 --> 00:09:02.109\nmore than 150,000 scientists\nand medical professionals,\n\n00:09:02.713 --> 00:09:06.010\nand individual women who either\ncouldn't afford Myriad's test,\n\n00:09:06.034 --> 00:09:09.038\nor who wanted to obtain\na second opinion but could not,\n\n00:09:09.062 --> 00:09:10.806\nas a result of the patents.\n\n00:09:12.273 --> 00:09:15.713\nOne of the major challenges\nwe had in preparing the case\n\n00:09:15.737 --> 00:09:18.603\nwas figuring out how best\nto communicate the science.\n\n00:09:19.037 --> 00:09:22.868\nSo in order to argue that what Myriad did\nwas not an invention,\n\n00:09:22.892 --> 00:09:26.169\nand that isolated BRCA genes\nwere products of nature,\n\n00:09:27.082 --> 00:09:29.795\nwe had to explain a couple\nof basic concepts, like:\n\n00:09:29.819 --> 00:09:31.963\nWhat's a gene? What's DNA?\n\n00:09:31.987 --> 00:09:35.703\nHow is DNA isolated,\nand why isn't that an invention?\n\n00:09:37.126 --> 00:09:40.988\nWe spent hours and hours\nwith our plaintiffs and experts,\n\n00:09:41.012 --> 00:09:43.948\ntrying to come up with ways\nof explaining these concepts\n\n00:09:43.972 --> 00:09:45.515\nsimply yet accurately.\n\n00:09:46.264 --> 00:09:49.596\nAnd we ended up relying heavily\non the use of metaphors,\n\n00:09:49.620 --> 00:09:50.776\nlike gold.\n\n00:09:51.747 --> 00:09:54.031\nSo isolating DNA --\n\n00:09:54.055 --> 00:09:56.555\nit's like extracting gold from a mountain\n\n00:09:57.063 --> 00:09:59.079\nor taking it out of a stream bed.\n\n00:09:59.103 --> 00:10:02.777\nYou might be able to patent\nthe process for mining the gold,\n\n00:10:02.801 --> 00:10:04.882\nbut you can't patent the gold itself.\n\n00:10:05.887 --> 00:10:08.630\nIt might've taken a lot\nof hard work and effort\n\n00:10:08.654 --> 00:10:10.514\nto dig the gold out of the mountain;\n\n00:10:11.085 --> 00:10:13.366\nyou still can't patent it,\nit's still gold.\n\n00:10:13.390 --> 00:10:15.146\nAnd the gold, once it's extracted,\n\n00:10:15.170 --> 00:10:17.258\ncan clearly be used\nfor all sorts of things\n\n00:10:17.282 --> 00:10:20.018\nthat it couldn't be used\nfor when it was in the mountain;\n\n00:10:20.042 --> 00:10:22.224\nyou can make jewelry\nout of it for example --\n\n00:10:22.248 --> 00:10:24.413\nstill can't patent the gold,\nit's still gold.\n\n00:10:25.322 --> 00:10:29.176\nSo now it's 2009,\nand we're ready to file our case.\n\n00:10:30.244 --> 00:10:33.739\nWe filed in federal court\nin the Southern District of New York,\n\n00:10:34.313 --> 00:10:37.679\nand the case was randomly assigned\nto Judge Robert Sweet.\n\n00:10:38.557 --> 00:10:41.757\nIn March 2010, Judge Sweet\nissued his opinion --\n\n00:10:42.527 --> 00:10:44.385\n152 pages --\n\n00:10:44.792 --> 00:10:47.044\nand a complete victory for our side.\n\n00:10:47.922 --> 00:10:49.353\nIn reading the opinion,\n\n00:10:49.377 --> 00:10:54.092\nwe could not get over how eloquently\nhe described the science in the case.\n\n00:10:54.462 --> 00:10:57.233\nI mean, our brief --\nit was pretty good,\n\n00:10:57.257 --> 00:10:58.824\nbut not this good.\n\n00:10:59.736 --> 00:11:03.113\nHow did he develop such a deep\nunderstanding of this issue\n\n00:11:03.137 --> 00:11:04.297\nin such a short time?\n\n00:11:04.321 --> 00:11:07.929\nWe just could not comprehend\nhow this had happened.\n\n00:11:07.953 --> 00:11:09.217\nSo it turned out,\n\n00:11:09.241 --> 00:11:12.551\nJudge Sweet's clerk\nworking for him at the time,\n\n00:11:12.575 --> 00:11:14.055\nwas not just a lawyer --\n\n00:11:14.079 --> 00:11:15.793\nhe was a scientist.\n\n00:11:15.817 --> 00:11:17.415\nHe was not just a scientist --\n\n00:11:17.439 --> 00:11:20.585\nhe had a PhD in molecular biology.\n\n00:11:20.609 --> 00:11:22.360\n(Laughter)\n\n00:11:22.384 --> 00:11:24.959\nWhat an incredible stroke of luck!\n\n00:11:26.016 --> 00:11:27.316\nMyriad then appealed\n\n00:11:27.340 --> 00:11:29.835\nto the US Court of Appeals\nfor the Federal Circuit.\n\n00:11:30.454 --> 00:11:32.470\nAnd here things got really interesting.\n\n00:11:33.423 --> 00:11:36.483\nFirst, in a pivotal moment of this case,\n\n00:11:37.145 --> 00:11:39.776\nthe US government switched sides.\n\n00:11:40.697 --> 00:11:44.446\nSo in the district court the government\nsubmitted a brief on Myriad's side.\n\n00:11:44.470 --> 00:11:49.598\nBut now in direct opposition\nto its own patent office,\n\n00:11:49.622 --> 00:11:52.330\nthe US government files a brief\nthat states that is has\n\n00:11:52.354 --> 00:11:56.042\nreconsidered this issue\nin light of the district court's opinion,\n\n00:11:56.066 --> 00:11:59.252\nand has concluded that isolated DNA\nis not patent eligible.\n\n00:11:59.776 --> 00:12:01.587\nThis was a really big deal,\n\n00:12:01.611 --> 00:12:03.173\ntotally unexpected.\n\n00:12:04.731 --> 00:12:06.811\nThe Court of Appeals\nfor the Federal Circuit\n\n00:12:06.835 --> 00:12:08.518\nhears all patent cases,\n\n00:12:08.542 --> 00:12:11.700\nand it has a reputation for being\nvery, very pro-patent.\n\n00:12:12.263 --> 00:12:14.689\nSo even with this remarkable development,\n\n00:12:14.713 --> 00:12:16.392\nwe expected to lose.\n\n00:12:16.416 --> 00:12:17.763\nAnd we did.\n\n00:12:18.347 --> 00:12:19.499\nSort of.\n\n00:12:20.315 --> 00:12:22.902\nEnds up split decision, 2 to 1.\n\n00:12:23.701 --> 00:12:26.197\nBut the two judges who ruled against us,\n\n00:12:26.221 --> 00:12:28.462\ndid so for completely different reasons.\n\n00:12:29.233 --> 00:12:31.059\nThe first one, Judge Lourie,\n\n00:12:31.083 --> 00:12:34.098\nmade up his own novel,\nbiological theory --\n\n00:12:34.122 --> 00:12:35.290\ntotally wrong.\n\n00:12:35.314 --> 00:12:36.325\n(Laughter)\n\n00:12:36.349 --> 00:12:38.567\nHe decided Myriad had created\na new chemical --\n\n00:12:38.591 --> 00:12:40.456\nmade absolutely no sense.\n\n00:12:40.480 --> 00:12:43.266\nMyriad didn't even argue this,\nso it came out of the blue.\n\n00:12:43.590 --> 00:12:45.567\nThe other, Judge Moore,\n\n00:12:45.591 --> 00:12:49.469\nsaid she basically agreed with us\nthat isolated DNA is a product of nature.\n\n00:12:49.945 --> 00:12:53.278\nBut she's like, \"I don't want\nto shake up the biotech industry.\"\n\n00:12:54.206 --> 00:12:56.778\nThe third, Judge Bryson,\n\n00:12:57.191 --> 00:12:58.407\nagreed with us.\n\n00:12:59.708 --> 00:13:02.239\nSo now we sought review\nby the Supreme Court.\n\n00:13:02.263 --> 00:13:04.966\nAnd when you petition the Supreme Court,\n\n00:13:04.990 --> 00:13:08.112\nyou have to present a question\nthat you want the Court to answer.\n\n00:13:08.492 --> 00:13:12.219\nUsually these questions take the form\nof a super-long paragraph,\n\n00:13:12.243 --> 00:13:15.266\nlike a whole page long\nwith lots and lots of clauses,\n\n00:13:15.290 --> 00:13:17.747\n\"wherein this\" and \"therefore that.\"\n\n00:13:18.252 --> 00:13:22.159\nWe submitted perhaps\nthe shortest question presented ever.\n\n00:13:23.270 --> 00:13:24.483\nFour words:\n\n00:13:26.178 --> 00:13:28.229\nAre human genes patentable?\n\n00:13:28.880 --> 00:13:31.704\nNow when Chris first asked me\nwhat I thought of these words,\n\n00:13:31.728 --> 00:13:33.102\nI said, \"Well, I don't know.\n\n00:13:33.126 --> 00:13:36.293\nI think you have to say,\n'Is isolated DNA patentable?'\"\n\n00:13:36.926 --> 00:13:38.095\n\"Nope.\n\n00:13:38.445 --> 00:13:43.066\nI want the justices to have\nthe very same reaction that I had\n\n00:13:43.090 --> 00:13:46.177\nwhen you brought this issue\nto me seven years ago.\"\n\n00:13:46.854 --> 00:13:49.011\nWell, I certainly couldn't\nargue with that.\n\n00:13:49.939 --> 00:13:52.822\nThe Supreme Court only hears\nabout one percent\n\n00:13:52.846 --> 00:13:54.512\nof the cases that it receives,\n\n00:13:54.536 --> 00:13:56.127\nand it agreed to hear ours.\n\n00:13:57.730 --> 00:14:01.857\nThe day of the oral argument arrives,\nand it was really, really exciting --\n\n00:14:01.881 --> 00:14:03.316\nlong line of people outside,\n\n00:14:03.340 --> 00:14:06.104\npeople had been standing in line\nsince 2:30 in the morning\n\n00:14:06.128 --> 00:14:07.862\nto try to get into the courthouse.\n\n00:14:07.886 --> 00:14:09.857\nTwo breast cancer organizations,\n\n00:14:09.881 --> 00:14:11.549\nBreast Cancer Action and FORCE,\n\n00:14:11.573 --> 00:14:14.274\nhad organized a demonstration\non the courthouse steps.\n\n00:14:15.190 --> 00:14:18.060\nChris and I sat quietly in the hallway,\n\n00:14:18.734 --> 00:14:21.748\nmoments before he was to walk in and argue\n\n00:14:21.772 --> 00:14:24.088\nthe most important case of his career.\n\n00:14:24.723 --> 00:14:27.102\nI was clearly more nervous than he was.\n\n00:14:28.054 --> 00:14:32.814\nBut any remaining panic subsided\nas I walked into the courtroom\n\n00:14:32.838 --> 00:14:35.651\nand looked around\nat a sea of friendly faces:\n\n00:14:36.017 --> 00:14:37.782\nour individual women clients\n\n00:14:37.806 --> 00:14:40.247\nwho had shared their\ndeeply personal stories,\n\n00:14:41.168 --> 00:14:44.794\nthe geneticists who had taken huge chunks\nof time out of their busy careers\n\n00:14:44.818 --> 00:14:46.643\nto dedicate themselves to this fight\n\n00:14:47.080 --> 00:14:49.659\nand representatives from a diverse array\n\n00:14:49.683 --> 00:14:51.570\nof medical, patient advocacy,\n\n00:14:51.594 --> 00:14:53.670\nenvironmental and religious organizations,\n\n00:14:53.694 --> 00:14:57.226\nwho had submitted friend of the court\nbriefs in the case.\n\n00:14:58.567 --> 00:15:01.592\nAlso in the room were three leaders\nof the Human Genome Project,\n\n00:15:01.616 --> 00:15:04.288\nincluding the co-discoverer\nof DNA himself,\n\n00:15:04.312 --> 00:15:05.602\nJames Watson,\n\n00:15:05.626 --> 00:15:07.772\nwho had submitted a brief to the court,\n\n00:15:07.796 --> 00:15:11.307\nwhere he referred\nto gene patenting as \"lunacy.\"\n\n00:15:11.331 --> 00:15:13.179\n(Laughter)\n\n00:15:13.203 --> 00:15:16.840\nThe diversity of the communities\nrepresented in this room\n\n00:15:16.864 --> 00:15:20.305\nand the contributions each had made\nto make this day a reality\n\n00:15:20.329 --> 00:15:22.626\nspoke volumes to what

me,\n\n00:15:29.119 --> 00:15:32.883\nthe most thrilling aspect was watching\nthe Supreme Court justices grapple\n\n00:15:32.907 --> 00:15:34.476\nwith isolated DNA,\n\n00:15:34.500 --> 00:15:37.726\nthrough a series of colorful analogies\nand feisty exchanges,\n\n00:15:37.750 --> 00:15:41.090\nvery much the same way\nas our legal team had done\n\n00:15:41.114 --> 00:15:42.804\nfor the past seven years.\n\n00:15:43.624 --> 00:15:46.280\nJustice Kagan likened isolating DNA\n\n00:15:46.304 --> 00:15:49.080\nto extracting a medicinal plant\nfrom the Amazon.\n\n00:15:50.474 --> 00:15:54.484\nJustice Roberts distinguished it\nfrom carving a baseball bat from a tree.\n\n00:15:55.953 --> 00:15:58.435\nAnd in one of my absolutely\nfavorite moments,\n\n00:15:58.459 --> 00:16:03.728\nJustice Sotomayor proclaimed isolated DNA\nto be \"just nature sitting there.\"\n\n00:16:03.752 --> 00:16:04.852\n(Laughter)\n\n00:16:05.276 --> 00:16:08.151\nWe felt pretty confident\nleaving the courtroom that day,\n\n00:16:08.175 --> 00:16:11.181\nbut I could never have\nanticipated the outcome:\n\n00:16:12.532 --> 00:16:14.039\nnine to zero.\n\n00:16:14.983 -->

00:16:31.530\nfive labs had announced\n\n00:16:31.554 --> 00:16:34.568\nthat they would begin to offer testing\nfor the BRCA genes.\n\n00:16:35.107 --> 00:16:38.590\nSome of them promised to offer the

swims like a salamander", "duration": "850", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/auke_ijspeert_a_robot_that_runs_and_swims_like_a_salamander", "transcript": "This is Pleurobot. Pleurobot is a robot that we designed to closely mimic a salamander species called Pleurodeles waltl. Pleurobot can walk, as you can see here, and as you'll see later, it can also swim.So you might ask, why did we design this robot? And in fact, this robot has been designed as a scientific tool for neuroscience. Indeed, we designed it together with neurobiologists to understand how animals move, and especially how the spinal cord controls locomotion. But the more I work in biorobotics, the more I'm really impressed by animal locomotion. If you think of a dolphin swimming or a cat running or jumping around, or even us as humans, when you go jogging or play tennis, we do amazing things. And in fact, our nervous system solves a very, very complex control problem. It has to coordinate more or less 200 muscles perfectly, because if the coordination is bad, we fall over or we do bad locomotion. And my goal is to understand how this works.There are four main components behind animal locomotion. The first component is just the body, and in fact we should never underestimate to what extent the biomechanics already simplify locomotion in animals. Then you have the spinal cord, and in the spinal cord you find reflexes, multiple reflexes that create a sensorimotor coordination loop between neural activity in the spinal cord and mechanical activity. A third component are central pattern generators. These are very interesting circuits in the spinal cord of vertebrate animals that can generate, by themselves, very coordinated rhythmic patterns of activity while receiving only very simple input signals. And these input signals coming from descending modulation from higher parts of the brain, like the motor cortex, the cerebellum, the basal ganglia, will all modulate activity of the spinal cord while we do locomotion. But what's interesting is to what extent just a low-level component, the spinal cord, together with the body, already solve a big part of the locomotion problem. You probably know it by the fact that you can cut the head off a chicken, it can still run for a while, showing that just the lower part, spinal cord and body, already solve a big part of locomotion.Now, understanding how this works is very complex, because first of all, recording activity in the spinal cord is very difficult. It's much easier to implant electrodes in the motor cortex than in the spinal cord, because it's protected by the vertebrae. Especially in humans, very hard to do. A second difficulty is that locomotion is really due to a very complex and very dynamic interaction between these four components. So it's very hard to find out what's the role of each over time. This is where biorobots like Pleurobot and mathematical models can really help.So what's biorobotics? Biorobotics is a very active field of research in robotics where people want to take inspiration from animals to make robots to go outdoors, like service robots or search and rescue robots or field robots. And the big goal here is to take inspiration from animals to make robots that can handle complex terrain \u2014 stairs, mountains, forests, places where robots still have difficulties and where animals can do a much better job. The robot can be a wonderful scientific tool as well. There are some very nice projects where robots are used, like a scientific tool for neuroscience, for biomechanics or for hydrodynamics. And this is exactly the purpose of Pleurobot. So what we do in my lab is to collaborate with neurobiologists like Jean-Marie Cabelguen, a neurobiologist in Bordeaux in France, and we want to make spinal cord models and validate them on robots. And here we want to start simple.So it's good to start with simple animals like lampreys, which are very primitive fish, and then gradually go toward more complex locomotion, like in salamanders, but also in cats and in humans, in mammals. And here, a robot becomes an interesting tool to validate our models. And in fact, for me, Pleurobot is a kind of dream becoming true. Like, more or less 20 years ago I was already working on a computer making simulations of lamprey and salamander locomotion during my PhD. But I always knew that my simulations were just approximations. Like, simulating the physics in water or with mud or with complex ground, it's very hard to simulate that properly on a computer. Why not have a real robot and real physics? So among all these animals, one of my favorites is the salamander. You might ask why, and it's because as an amphibian, it's a really key animal from an evolutionary point of view. It makes a wonderful link between swimming, as you find it in eels or fish, and quadruped locomotion, as you see in mammals, in cats and humans. And in fact, the modern salamander is very close to the first terrestrial vertebrate, so it's almost a living fossil, which gives us access to our ancestor, the ancestor to all terrestrial tetrapods.So the salamander swims by doing what's called an anguilliform swimming gait, so they propagate a nice traveling wave of muscle activity from head to tail. And if you place the salamander on the ground, it switches to what's called a walking trot gait. In this case, you have nice periodic activation of the limbs which are very nicely coordinated with this standing wave undulation of the body, and that's exactly the gait that you are seeing here on Pleurobot. Now, one thing which is very surprising and fascinating in fact is the fact that all this can be generated just by the spinal cord and the body. So if you take a decerebrated salamander \u2014 it's not so nice but you remove the head \u2014 and if you electrically stimulate the spinal cord, at low level of stimulation this will induce a walking-like gait. If you stimulate a bit more, the gait accelerates. And at some point, there's a threshold, and automatically, the animal switches to swimming. This is amazing. Just changing the global drive, as if you are pressing the gas pedal of descending modulation to your spinal cord, makes a complete switch between two very different gaits. And in fact, the same has been observed in cats. If you stimulate the spinal cord of a cat, you can switch between walk, trot and gallop. Or in birds, you can make a bird switch between walking, at a low level of stimulation, and flapping its wings at high-level stimulation. And this really shows that the spinal cord is a very sophisticated locomotion controller.So we studied salamander locomotion in more detail, and we had in fact access to a very nice X-ray video machine from Professor Martin Fischer in Jena University in Germany. And thanks to that, you really have an amazing machine to record all the bone motion in great detail. That's what we did. So we basically figured out which bones are important for us and collected their motion in 3D. And what we did is collect a whole database of motions, both on ground and in water, to really collect a whole database of motor behaviors that a real animal can do. And then our job as roboticists was to replicate that in our robot. So we did a whole optimization process to find out the right structure, where to place the motors, how to connect them together, to be able to replay these motions as well as possible. And this is how Pleurobot came to life.So let's look at how close it is to the real animal. So what you see here is almost a direct comparison between the walking of the real animal and the Pleurobot. You can see that we have almost a one-to-one exact replay of the walking gait. If you go backwards and slowly, you see it even better. But even better, we can do swimming. So for that we have a dry suit that we put all over the robot \u2014(Laughter)and then we can go in water and start replaying the swimming gaits. And here, we were very happy, because this is difficult to do. The physics of interaction are complex. Our robot is much bigger than a small animal, so we had to do what's called dynamic scaling of the frequencies to make sure we had the same interaction physics. But you see at the end, we have a very close match, and we were very, very happy with this. So let's go to the spinal cord. So here what we did with Jean-Marie Cabelguen is model the spinal cord circuits. And what's interesting is that the salamander has kept a very primitive circuit, which is very similar to the one we find in the lamprey, this primitive eel-like fish, and it looks like during evolution, new neural oscillators have been added to control the limbs, to do the leg locomotion. And we know where these neural oscillators are but what we did was to make a mathematical model to see how they should be coupled to allow this transition between the two very different gaits. And we tested that on board of a robot.And this is how it looks. So what you see here is a previous version of Pleurobot that's completely controlled by our spinal cord model programmed on board of the robot. And the only thing we do is send to the robot through a remote control the two descending signals it normally should receive from the upper part of the brain. And what's interesting is, by playing with these signals, we can completely control speed, heading and type of gait. For instance, when we stimulate at a low level, we have the walking gait, and at some point, if we stimulate a lot, very rapidly it switches to the swimming gait. And finally, we can also do turning very nicely by just stimulating more one side of the spinal cord than the other. And I think it's really beautiful how nature has distributed control to really give a lot of responsibility to the spinal cord so that the upper part of the brain doesn't need to worry about every muscle. It just has to worry about this high-level modulation, and it's really the job of the spinal cord to coordinate all the muscles.So now let's go to cat locomotion and the importance of biomechanics. So this is another project where we studied cat biomechanics, and we wanted to see how much the morphology helps locomotion. And we found three important criteria in the properties, basically, of the limbs. The first one is that a cat limb more or less looks like a pantograph-like structure. So a pantograph is a mechanical structure which keeps the upper segment and the lower segments always parallel. So a simple geometrical system that kind of coordinates a bit the internal movement of the segments. A second property of cat limbs is that they are very lightweight. Most of the muscles are in the trunk, which is a good idea, because then the limbs have low inertia and can be moved very rapidly. The last final important property is this very elastic behavior of the cat limb, so to handle impacts and forces. And this is how we designed Cheetah-Cub.So let's invite Cheetah-Cub onstage. So this is Peter Eckert, who does his PhD on this robot, and as you see, it's a cute little robot. It looks a bit like a toy, but it was really used as a scientific tool to investigate these properties of the legs of the cat. So you see, it's very compliant, very lightweight, and also very elastic, so you can easily press it down and it will not break. It will just jump, in fact. And this very elastic property is also very important. And you also see a bit these properties of these three segments of the leg as pantograph.Now, what's interesting is that this quite dynamic gait is obtained purely in open loop, meaning no sensors, no complex feedback loops. And that's interesting, because it means that just the mechanics already stabilized this quite rapid gait, and that really good mechanics already basically simplify locomotion. To the extent that we can even disturb a bit locomotion, as you will see in the next video, where we can for instance do some exercise where we have the robot go down a step, and the robot will not fall over, which was a surprise for us. This is a small perturbation. I was expecting the robot to immediately fall over, because there are no sensors, no fast feedback loop. But no, just the mechanics stabilized the gait, and the robot doesn't fall over. Obviously, if you make the step bigger, and if you have obstacles, you need the full control loops and reflexes and everything. But what's important here is that just for small perturbation, the mechanics are right. And I think this is a very important message from biomechanics and robotics to neuroscience, saying don't underestimate to what extent the body already helps locomotion.Now, how does this relate to human locomotion? Clearly, human locomotion is more complex than cat and salamander locomotion, but at the same time, the nervous system of humans is very similar to that of other vertebrates. And especially the spinal cord is also the key controller for locomotion in humans. That's why, if there's a lesion of the spinal cord, this has dramatic effects. The person can become paraplegic or tetraplegic. This is because the brain loses this communication with the spinal cord. Especially, it loses this descending modulation to initiate and modulate locomotion. So a big goal of neuroprosthetics is to be able to reactivate that communication using electrical or chemical stimulations. And there are several teams in the world that do exactly that, especially at EPFL. My colleagues Gr\u00e9goire Courtine and Silvestro Micera, with whom I collaborate.But to do this properly, it's very important to understand how the spinal cord works, how it interacts with the body, and how the brain communicates with the spinal cord. This is where the robots and models that I've presented today will hopefully play a key role towards these very important goals.Thank you.(Applause)Bruno Giussani: Auke, I've seen in your lab other robots that do things like swim in pollution and measure the pollution while they swim. But for this one, you mentioned in your talk, like a side project, search and rescue, and it does have a camera on its nose.Auke Ijspeert: Absolutely. So the robot \u2014 We have some spin-off projects where we would like to use the robots to do search and rescue inspection, so this robot is now seeing you. And the big dream is to, if you have a difficult situation like a collapsed building or a building that is flooded, and this is very dangerous for a rescue team or even rescue dogs, why not send in a robot that can crawl around, swim, walk, with a camera onboard to do inspection and identify survivors and possibly create a communication link with the survivor.BG: Of course, assuming the survivors don't get scared by the shape of this.AI: Yeah, we should probably change the appearance quite a bit, because here I guess a survivor might die of a heart attack just of being worried that this would feed on you. But by changing the appearance and it making it more robust, I'm sure we can make a good tool out of it.BG: Thank you very much.

--> 00:02:53.934\nwhere people want to\ntake inspiration from animals\n\n00:02:53.958 --> 00:02:56.414\nto make robots to go outdoors,\n\n00:02:56.438 --> 00:02:59.094\nlike service robots\nor search and rescue robots\n\n00:02:59.118 --> 00:03:00.318\nor field robots.\n\n00:03:00.838 --> 00:03:03.534\nAnd the big goal here\nis to take inspiration from animals\n\n00:03:03.558 --> 00:03:05.894\nto make robots that can handle\ncomplex terrain --\n\n00:03:05.918 --> 00:03:07.534\nstairs, mountains, forests,\n\n00:03:07.558 --> 00:03:09.574\nplaces where robots\nstill have difficulties\n\n00:03:09.598 --> 00:03:11.654\nand where animals\ncan do a much better job.\n\n00:03:11.678 --> 00:03:14.174\nThe robot can be a wonderful\nscientific tool as well.\n\n00:03:14.198 --> 00:03:16.818\nThere are some very nice projects\nwhere robots are used,\n\n00:03:16.842 --> 00:03:20.814\nlike a scientific tool for neuroscience,\nfor biomechanics or for hydrodynamics.\n\n00:03:20.838 --> 00:03:22.958\nAnd this is exactly\nthe purpose of Pleurobot.\n\n00:03:23.558 --> 00:03:26.494\nSo what we do in my lab\nis to collaborate with neurobiologists\n\n00:03:26.518 --> 00:03:29.734\nlike Jean-Marie Cabelguen,\na neurobiologist in Bordeaux in France,\n\n00:03:29.758 --> 00:03:33.798\nand we want to make spinal cord models\nand validate them on robots.\n\n00:03:34.438 --> 00:03:36.054\nAnd here we want to start simple.\n\n00:03:36.078 --> 00:03:38.054\nSo it's good to start with simple animals\n\n00:03:38.078 --> 00:03:40.334\nlike lampreys, which are\nvery primitive fish,\n\n00:03:40.358 --> 00:03:42.854\nand then gradually\ngo toward more complex locomotion,\n\n00:03:42.878 --> 00:03:44.134\nlike in salamanders,\n\n00:03:44.158 --> 00:03:45.654\nbut also in cats and in humans,\n\n00:03:45.678 --> 00:03:46.878\nin mammals.\n\n00:03:47.838 --> 00:03:50.214\nAnd here, a robot becomes\nan interesting tool\n\n00:03:50.238 --> 00:03:52.174\nto validate our models.\n\n00:03:52.198 --> 00:03:55.214\nAnd in fact, for me, Pleurobot\nis a kind of dream becoming true.\n\n00:03:55.238 --> 00:03:58.494\nLike, more or less 20 years ago\nI was already working on a computer\n\n00:03:58.518 --> 00:04:01.174\nmaking simulations of lamprey\nand salamander locomotion\n\n00:04:01.198 --> 00:04:02.734\nduring my PhD.\n\n00:04:02.758 --> 00:04:06.134\nBut I always knew that my simulations\nwere just approximations.\n\n00:04:06.158 --> 00:04:10.134\nLike, simulating the physics in water\nor with mud or with complex ground,\n\n00:04:10.158 --> 00:04:12.814\nit's very hard to simulate that\nproperly on a computer.\n\n00:04:12.838 --> 00:04:14.878\nWhy not have a real robot\nand real physics?\n\n00:04:15.558 --> 00:04:18.694\nSo among all these animals,\none of my favorites is the salamander.\n\n00:04:18.718 --> 00:04:22.174\nYou might ask why,\nand it's because as an amphibian,\n\n00:04:22.198 --> 00:04:25.054\nit's a really key animal\nfrom an evolutionary point of view.\n\n00:04:25.078 --> 00:04:27.134\nIt makes a wonderful link\nbetween swimming,\n\n00:04:27.158 --> 00:04:29.054\nas you find it in eels or fish,\n\n00:04:29.078 --> 00:04:33.198\nand quadruped locomotion,\nas you see in mammals, in cats and humans.\n\n00:04:34.118 --> 00:04:35.774\nAnd in fact, the modern salamander\n\n00:04:35.798 --> 00:04:38.174\nis very close to the first\nterrestrial vertebrate,\n\n00:04:38.198 --> 00:04:39.734\nso it's almost a living fossil,\n\n00:04:39.758 --> 00:04:41.694\nwhich gives us access to our ancestor,\n\n00:04:41.718 --> 00:04:44.638\nthe ancestor to all terrestrial tetrapods.\n\n00:04:45.198 --> 00:04:46.574\nSo the salamander swims\n\n00:04:46.598 --> 00:04:49.094\nby doing what's called\nan anguilliform swimming gait,\n\n00:04:49.118 --> 00:04:52.758\nso they propagate a nice traveling wave\nof muscle activity from head to tail.\n\n00:04:53.398 --> 00:04:55.574\nAnd if you place\nthe salamander on the ground,\n\n00:04:55.598 --> 00:04:57.934\nit switches to what's called\na walking trot gait.\n\n00:04:57.958 --> 00:05:00.821\nIn this case, you have nice\nperiodic activation of the limbs\n\n00:05:00.845 --> 00:05:02.454\nwhich are very nicely coordinated\n\n00:05:02.478 --> 00:05:05.134\nwith this standing wave\nundulation of the body,\n\n00:05:05.158 --> 00:05:08.814\nand that's exactly the gait\nthat you are seeing here on Pleurobot.\n\n00:05:08.838 --> 00:05:11.814\nNow, one thing which is very surprising\nand fascinating in fact\n\n00:05:11.838 --> 00:05:15.974\nis the fact that all this can be generated\njust by the spinal cord and the body.\n\n00:05:15.998 --> 00:05:17.998\nSo if you take\na decerebrated salamander --\n\n00:05:18.022 --> 00:05:20.038\nit's not so nice\nbut you remove the head --\n\n00:05:20.062 --> 00:05:22.734\nand if you electrically\nstimulate the spinal cord,\n\n00:05:22.758 --> 00:05:26.014\nat low level of stimulation\nthis will induce a walking-like gait.\n\n00:05:26.038 --> 00:05:28.494\nIf you stimulate a bit more,\nthe gait accelerates.\n\n00:05:28.518 --> 00:05:30.414\nAnd at some point, there's a threshold,\n\n00:05:30.438 --> 00:05:32.974\nand automatically,\nthe animal switches to swimming.\n\n00:05:32.998 --> 00:05:34.374\nThis is amazing.\n\n00:05:34.398 --> 00:05:35.894\nJust changing the global drive,\n\n00:05:35.918 --> 00:05:37.654\nas if you are pressing the gas pedal\n\n00:05:37.678 --> 00:05:39.814\nof descending modulation\nto your spinal cord,\n\n00:05:39.838 --> 00:05:42.838\nmakes a complete switch\nbetween two very different gaits.\n\n00:05:44.398 --> 00:05:46.974\nAnd in fact, the same\nhas been observed in cats.\n\n00:05:46.998 --> 00:05:49.014\nIf you stimulate the spinal cord of a cat,\n\n00:05:49.038 --> 00:05:51.254\nyou can switch between\nwalk, trot and gallop.\n\n00:05:51.278 --> 00:05:54.014\nOr in birds, you can make a bird\nswitch between walking,\n\n00:05:54.038 --> 00:05:55.494\nat a low level of stimulation,\n\n00:05:55.518 --> 00:05:58.334\nand flapping its wings\nat high-level stimulation.\n\n00:05:58.358 --> 00:06:00.374\nAnd this really shows that the spinal cord\n\n00:06:00.398 --> 00:06:02.814\nis a very sophisticated\nlocomotion controller.\n\n00:06:02.838 --> 00:06:05.294\nSo we studied salamander locomotion\nin more detail,\n\n00:06:05.318 --> 00:06:08.414\nand we had in fact access\nto a very nice X-ray video machine\n\n00:06:08.438 --> 00:06:12.014\nfrom Professor Martin Fischer\nin Jena University in Germany.\n\n00:06:12.038 --> 00:06:14.614\nAnd thanks to that,\nyou really have an amazing machine\n\n00:06:14.638 --> 00:06:17.094\nto record all the bone motion\nin great detail.\n\n00:06:17.118 --> 00:06:18.374\nThat's what we did.\n\n00:06:18.398 --> 00:06:21.574\nSo we basically figured out\nwhich bones are important for us\n\n00:06:21.598 --> 00:06:24.614\nand collected their motion in 3D.\n\n00:06:24.638 --> 00:06:27.334\nAnd what we did is collect\na whole database of motions,\n\n00:06:27.358 --> 00:06:29.014\nboth on ground and in water,\n\n00:06:29.038 --> 00:06:31.522\nto really collect a whole database\nof motor behaviors\n\n00:06:31.547 --> 00:06:32.791\nthat a real animal can do.\n\n00:06:32.816 --> 00:06:35.966\nAnd then our job as roboticists\nwas to replicate that in our robot.\n\n00:06:35.991 --> 00:06:39.374\nSo we did a whole optimization process\nto find out the right structure,\n\n00:06:39.398 --> 00:06:42.054\nwhere to place the motors,\nhow to connect them together,\n\n00:06:42.078 --> 00:06:44.958\nto be able to replay\nthese motions as well as possible.\n\n00:06:45.638 --> 00:06:47.998\nAnd this is how Pleurobot came to life.\n\n00:06:49.158 --> 00:06:51.574\nSo let's look at how close\nit is to the real animal.\n\n00:06:52.918 --> 00:06:55.414\nSo what you see here\nis almost a direct comparison\n\n00:06:55.438 --> 00:06:58.134\nbetween the walking\nof the real animal and the Pleurobot.\n\n00:06:58.158 --> 00:07:00.894\nYou can see that we have\nalmost a one-to-one exact replay\n\n00:07:00.918 --> 00:07:02.174\nof the walking gait.\n\n00:07:02.198 --> 00:07:04.798\nIf you go backwards and slowly,\nyou see it even better.\n\n00:07:07.478 --> 00:07:09.854\nBut even better, we can do swimming.\n\n00:07:09.878 --> 00:07:12.894\nSo for that we have a dry suit\nthat we put all over the robot --\n\n00:07:12.918 --> 00:07:14.014\n(Laughter)\n\n00:07:14.038 --> 00:07:17.214\nand then we can go in water\nand start replaying the swimming gaits.\n\n00:07:17.238 --> 00:07:20.574\nAnd here, we were very happy,\nbecause this is difficult to do.\n\n00:07:20.598 --> 00:07:22.814\nThe physics of interaction are complex.\n\n00:07:22.838 --> 00:07:25.254\nOur robot is much bigger\nthan a small animal,\n\n00:07:25.278 --> 00:07:28.334\nso we had to do what's called\ndynamic scaling of the frequencies\n\n00:07:28.358 --> 00:07:30.694\nto make sure we had\nthe same interaction physics.\n\n00:07:30.718 --> 00:07:33.134\nBut you see at the end,\nwe have a very close match,\n\n00:07:33.158 --> 00:07:35.038\nand we were very, very happy with this.\n\n00:07:35.438 --> 00:07:37.654\nSo let's go to the spinal cord.\n\n00:07:37.678 --> 00:07:39.974\nSo here what we did\nwith Jean-Marie Cabelguen\n\n00:07:39.998 --> 00:07:42.238\nis model the spinal cord circuits.\n\n00:07:42.998 --> 00:07:45.134\nAnd what's interesting\nis that the salamander\n\n00:07:45.158 --> 00:07:46.778\nhas kept a very primitive circuit,\n\n00:07:46.802 --> 00:07:49.454\nwhich is very similar\nto the one we find in the lamprey,\n\n00:07:49.478 --> 00:07:51.454\nthis primitive eel-like fish,\n\n00:07:51.478 --> 00:07:53.214\nand it looks like during evolution,\n\n00:07:53.238 --> 00:07:56.174\nnew neural oscillators\nhave been added to control the limbs,\n\n00:07:56.198 --> 00:07:57.614\nto do the leg locomotion.\n\n00:07:57.638 --> 00:07:59.814\nAnd we know where\nthese neural oscillators are\n\n00:07:59.838 --> 00:08:02.094\nbut what we did was to make\na mathematical model\n\n00:08:02.118 --> 00:08:03.734\nto see how they should be coupled\n\n00:08:03.758 --> 00:08:06.694\nto allow this transition\nbetween the two very different gaits.\n\n00:08:06.718 --> 00:08:09.278\nAnd we tested that on board of a robot.\n\n00:08:09.638 --> 00:08:10.838\nAnd this is how it looks.\n\n00:08:18.878 --> 00:08:21.894\nSo what you see here\nis a previous version of Pleurobot\n\n00:08:21.918 --> 00:08:25.014\nthat's completely controlled\nby our spinal cord model\n\n00:08:25.038 --> 00:08:26.638\nprogrammed on board of the robot.\n\n00:08:27.238 --> 00:08:28.454\nAnd the only thing we do\n\n00:08:28.478 --> 00:08:30.654\nis send to the robot\nthrough a remote control\n\n00:08:30.678 --> 00:08:33.174\nthe two descending signals\nit normally should receive\n\n00:08:33.198 --> 00:08:34.798\nfrom the upper part of the brain.\n\n00:08:35.438 --> 00:08:38.134\nAnd what's interesting is,\nby playing with these signals,\n\n00:08:38.158 --> 00:08:40.958\nwe can completely control\nspeed, heading and type of gait.\n\n00:08:41.558 --> 00:08:42.774\nFor instance,\n\n00:08:42.798 --> 00:08:46.374\nwhen we stimulate at a low level,\nwe have the walking gait,\n\n00:08:46.398 --> 00:08:48.374\nand at some point, if we stimulate a lot,\n\n00:08:48.398 --> 00:08:50.558\nvery rapidly it switches\nto the swimming gait.\n\n00:08:51.438 --> 00:08:53.654\nAnd finally, we can also\ndo turning very nicely\n\n00:08:53.678 --> 00:08:57.198\nby just stimulating more one side\nof the spinal cord than the other.\n\n00:08:58.158 --> 00:08:59.774\nAnd I think it's really beautiful\n\n00:08:59.798 --> 00:09:02.054\nhow nature has distributed control\n\n00:09:02.078 --> 00:09:04.934\nto really give a lot of responsibility\nto the spinal cord\n\n00:09:04.958 --> 00:09:08.614\nso that the upper part of the brain\ndoesn't need to worry about every muscle.\n\n00:09:08.638 --> 00:09:11.174\nIt just has to worry\nabout this high-level modulation,\n\n00:09:11.198 --> 00:09:14.774\nand it's really the job of the spinal cord\nto coordinate all the muscles.\n\n00:09:14.798 --> 00:09:18.318\nSo now let's go to cat locomotion\nand the importance of biomechanics.\n\n00:09:19.038 --> 00:09:20.294\nSo this is another project\n\n00:09:20.318 --> 00:09:22.734\nwhere we studied cat biomechanics,\n\n00:09:22.758 --> 00:09:26.654\nand we wanted to see how much\nthe morphology helps locomotion.\n\n00:09:26.678 --> 00:09:30.294\nAnd we found three important\ncriteria in the properties,\n\n00:09:30.318 --> 00:09:31.638\nbasically, of the limbs.\n\n00:09:32.278 --> 00:09:34.254\nThe first one is that a cat limb\n\n00:09:34.278 --> 00:09:36.974\nmore or less looks\nlike a pantograph-like structure.\n\n00:09:36.998 --> 00:09:39.214\nSo a pantograph is a mechanical structure\n\n00:09:39.238 --> 00:09:42.638\nwhich keeps the upper segment\nand the lower segments always parallel.\n\n00:09:43.558 --> 00:09:46.654\nSo a simple geometrical system\nthat kind of coordinates a bit\n\n00:09:46.678 --> 00:09:48.494\nthe internal movement of the segments.\n\n00:09:48.518 --> 00:09:51.574\nA second property of cat limbs\nis that they are very lightweight.\n\n00:09:51.598 --> 00:09:53.454\nMost of the muscles are in the trunk,\n\n00:09:53.478 --> 00:09:56.374\nwhich is a good idea,\nbecause then the limbs have low inertia\n\n00:09:56.398 --> 00:09:58.174\nand can be moved very rapidly.\n\n00:09:58.198 --> 00:10:02.014\nThe last final important property is this\nvery elastic behavior of the cat limb,\n\n00:10:02.038 --> 00:10:04.694\nso to handle impacts and forces.\n\n00:10:04.718 --> 00:10:07.054\nAnd this is how we designed Cheetah-Cub.\n\n00:10:07.078 --> 00:10:09.278\nSo let's invite Cheetah-Cub onstage.\n\n00:10:14.118 --> 00:10:17.774\nSo this is Peter Eckert,\nwho does his PhD on this robot,\n\n00:10:17.798 --> 00:10:19.854\nand as you see, it's a cute little robot.\n\n00:10:19.878 --> 00:10:21.134\nIt looks a bit like a toy,\n\n00:10:21.158 --> 00:10:23.214\nbut it was really used\nas a scientific tool\n\n00:10:23.238 --> 00:10:26.534\nto investigate these properties\nof the legs of the cat.\n\n00:10:26.558 --> 00:10:29.174\nSo you see, it's very compliant,\nvery lightweight,\n\n00:10:29.198 --> 00:10:30.454\nand also very elastic,\n\n00:10:30.478 --> 00:10:33.254\nso you can easily press it down\nand it will not break.\n\n00:10:33.278 --> 00:10:34.734\nIt will just jump, in fact.\n\n00:10:34.758 --> 00:10:37.638\nAnd this very elastic property\nis also very important.\n\n00:10:39.118 --> 00:10:41.014\nAnd you also see a bit these properties\n\n00:10:41.038 --> 00:10:43.438\nof these three segments\nof the leg as pantograph.\n\n00:10:44.238 --> 00:10:47.014\nNow, what's interesting\nis that this quite dynamic gait\n\n00:10:47.038 --> 00:10:48.934\nis obtained purely in open loop,\n\n00:10:48.958 --> 00:10:52.094\nmeaning no sensors,\nno complex feedback loops.\n\n00:10:52.118 --> 00:10:54.534\nAnd that's interesting, because it means\n\n00:10:54.558 --> 00:10:58.574\nthat just the mechanics\nalready stabilized this quite rapid gait,\n\n00:10:58.598 --> 00:11:02.774\nand that really good mechanics\nalready basically simplify locomotion.\n\n00:11:02.798 --> 00:11:06.094\nTo the extent that we can even\ndisturb a bit locomotion,\n\n00:11:06.118 --> 00:11:07.774\nas you will see in the next video,\n\n00:11:07.798 --> 00:11:11.694\nwhere we can for instance do some exercise\nwhere we have the robot go down a step,\n\n00:11:11.718 --> 00:11:13.334\nand the robot will not fall over,\n\n00:11:13.358 --> 00:11:14.934\nwhich was a surprise for us.\n\n00:11:14.958 --> 00:11:16.374\nThis is a small perturbation.\n\n00:11:16.398 --> 00:11:18.814\nI was expecting the robot\nto immediately fall over,\n\n00:11:18.838 --> 00:11:21.274\nbecause there are no sensors,\nno fast feedback loop.\n\n00:11:21.298 --> 00:11:23.494\nBut no, just the mechanics\nstabilized the gait,\n\n00:11:23.518 --> 00:11:25.094\nand the robot doesn't fall over.\n\n00:11:25.118 --> 00:11:28.254\nObviously, if you make the step bigger,\nand if you have obstacles,\n\n00:11:28.278 --> 00:11:31.934\nyou need the full control loops\nand reflexes and everything.\n\n00:11:31.958 --> 00:11:34.894\nBut what's important here\nis that just for small perturbation,\n\n00:11:34.918 --> 00:11:36.414\nthe mechanics are right.\n\n00:11:36.438 --> 00:11:38.534\nAnd I think this is\na very important message\n\n00:11:38.558 --> 00:11:40.749\nfrom biomechanics and robotics\nto neuroscience,\n\n00:11:40.773 --> 00:11:45.453\nsaying don't underestimate to what extent\nthe body already helps locomotion.\n\n00:11:47.398 --> 00:11:49.558\nNow, how does this relate\nto human locomotion?\n\n00:11:49.918 --> 00:11:53.558\nClearly, human locomotion is more complex\nthan cat and salamander locomotion,\n\n00:11:54.318 --> 00:11:57.454\nbut at the same time, the nervous system\nof humans is very similar\n\n00:11:57.478 --> 00:11:59.054\nto that of other vertebrates.\n\n00:11:59.078 --> 00:12:00.534\nAnd especially the spinal cord\n\n00:12:00.558 --> 00:12:03.198\nis also the key controller\nfor locomotion in humans.\n\n00:12:03.718 --> 00:12:06.134\nThat's why, if there's a lesion\nof the spinal cord,\n\n00:12:06.158 --> 00:12:07.654\nthis has dramatic effects.\n\n00:12:07.678 --> 00:12:10.454\nThe person can become\nparaplegic or tetraplegic.\n\n00:12:10.478 --> 00:12:12.854\nThis is because the brain\nloses this communication\n\n00:12:12.878 --> 00:12:14.134\nwith the spinal cord.\n\n00:12:14.158 --> 00:12:16.374\nEspecially, it loses\nthis descending modulation\n\n00:12:16.398 --> 00:12:18.318\nto initiate and modulate locomotion.\n\n00:12:19.598 --> 00:12:21.294\nSo a big goal of neuroprosthetics\n\n00:12:21.318 --> 00:12:23.694\nis to be able to reactivate\nthat communication\n\n00:12:23.718 --> 00:12:26.158\nusing electrical or chemical stimulations.\n\n00:12:26.798 --> 00:12:29.734\nAnd there are several teams\nin the world that do exactly that,\n\n00:12:29.758 --> 00:12:30.974\nespecially at EPFL.\n\n00:12:30.998 --> 00:12:33.494\nMy colleagues Gr\u00e9goire Courtine\nand Silvestro Micera,\n\n00:12:33.518 --> 00:12:34.758\nwith whom I collaborate.\n\n00:12:35.918 --> 00:12:39.014\nBut to do this properly,\nit's very important to understand\n\n00:12:39.038 --> 00:12:40.774\nhow the spinal cord works,\n\n00:12:40.798 --> 00:12:42.494\nhow it interacts with the body,\n\n00:12:42.518 --> 00:12:44.998\nand how the brain\ncommunicates with the spinal cord.\n\n00:12:45.758 --> 00:12:48.654\nThis is where the robots\nand models that I've presented today\n\n00:12:48.678 --> 00:12:50.574\nwill hopefully play a key role\n\n00:12:50.598 --> 00:12:53.254\ntowards these very important goals.\n\n00:12:53.278 --> 00:12:54.494\nThank you.\n\n00:12:54.518 --> 00:12:59.078\n(Applause)\n\n00:13:04.058 --> 00:13:06.694\nBruno Giussani: Auke, I've seen\nin your lab other robots\n\n00:13:06.718 --> 00:13:09.174\nthat do things like swim in pollution\n\n00:13:09.198 --> 00:13:11.654\nand measure the pollution while they swim.\n\n00:13:11.678 --> 00:13:12.894\nBut for this one,\n\n00:13:12.918 --> 00:13:16.398\nyou mentioned in your talk,\nlike a side project,\n\n00:13:17.598 --> 00:13:18.814\nsearch and rescue,\n\n00:13:18.838 --> 00:13:21.014\nand it does have a camera on its nose.\n\n00:13:21.038 --> 00:13:23.534\nAuke Ijspeert: Absolutely. So the robot --\n\n00:13:23.558 --> 00:13:24.987\nWe have some spin-off projects\n\n00:13:25.011 --> 00:13:28.454\nwhere we would like to use the robots\nto do search and rescue inspection,\n\n00:13:28.478 --> 00:13:30.054\nso this robot is now seeing you.\n\n00:13:30.078 --> 00:13:33.254\nAnd the big dream is to,\nif you have a difficult situation\n\n00:13:33.278 --> 00:13:36.894\nlike a collapsed building\nor a building that is flooded,\n\n00:13:36.918 --> 00:13:40.254\nand this is very dangerous\nfor a rescue team or even rescue dogs,\n\n00:13:40.278 --> 00:13:43.174\nwhy not send in a robot\nthat can crawl around, swim, walk,\n\n00:13:43.198 --> 00:13:46.374\nwith a camera onboard\nto do inspection and identify survivors\n\n00:13:46.398 --> 00:13:49.174\nand possibly create\na communication link with the survivor.\n\n00:13:49.198 --> 00:13:52.774\nBG: Of course, assuming the survivors\ndon't get scared by the shape of this.\n\n00:13:52.798 --> 00:13:56.094\nAI: Yeah, we should probably\nchange the appearance quite a bit,\n\n00:13:56.118 --> 00:13:58.934\nbecause here I guess a survivor\nmight die of a heart attack\n\n00:13:58.958 --> 00:14:01.494\njust of being worried\nthat this would feed on you.\n\n00:14:01.518 --> 00:14:04.374\nBut by changing the appearance\nand it making it more robust,\n\n00:14:04.398 --> 00:14:06.454\nI'm sure we can make\na good tool out of it.\n\n00:14:06.478 --> 00:14:08.764\nBG: Thank you very much.\nThank you and your team."}, {"title": "Our campaign to ban plastic bags in Bali", "duration": "660", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/melati_and_isabel_wijsen_our_campaign_to_ban_plastic_bags_in_bali", "transcript": "Melati Wijsen: Bali \u2014 island of gods.Isabel Wijsen: A green paradise.MW: Or ... a paradise lost. Bali: island of garbage.IW: In Bali, we generate 680 cubic meters of plastic garbage a day. That's about a 14-story building. And when it comes to plastic bags, less than five percent gets recycled.MW: We know that changes the image you may have of our island. It changed ours, too, when we learned about it, when we learned that almost all plastic bags in Bali end up in our drains and then in our rivers and then in our ocean. And those that don't even make it to the ocean, they're either burned or littered.IW: So we decided to do something about it. And we've been working for almost three years now to try to say no to plastic bags on our home island. And we have had some significant successes.MW: We are sisters, and we go to the best school on earth: Green School, Bali. Green School is not only different in the way that it is built out of bamboo, but also in the way that it teaches. We are taught to become leaders of today, something a normal textbook cannot match.IW: One day we had a lesson in class where we learned about significant people, like Nelson Mandela, Lady Diana and Mahatma Gandhi. Walking home that day, we agreed that we also wanted to be significant. Why should we wait until we were grown up to be significant? We wanted to do something now.MW: Sitting on the sofa that night, we brainstormed and thought of all the issues facing Bali. And one thing that stood out to us the most was the plastic garbage. But that is a huge problem. So we looked into what was a realistic target for us kids: plastic bags. And the idea was born.IW: We started researching, and let's just say, the more we learned, there was nothing good about plastic bags. And you know what? We don't even need them.MW: We were really inspired by the efforts to say no to plastic bags in many other places, from Hawaii to Rwanda and to severals cities like Oakland and Dublin.IW: And so the idea turned into the launch of \"Bye Bye Plastic Bags.\" MW: In the years that we have been campaigning, we have learned a lot.Lesson number one: you cannot do it all by yourself. You need a big team of like-minded kids, and so we formed the Bye Bye Plastic Bags crew. The volunteer team includes children from all over the island, from both international and local schools. And together with them, we started a multi-layered approach, based on an on- and off-line signature petition, educational and inspirational presentations at schools and we raise general awareness at markets, festivals, beach clean-ups. And last but not least, we distribute alternative bags, bags like net bags, recycled newspaper bags or 100 percent organic material bags, all made by local initiatives on the island.IW: We run a pilot village, home of 800 families. The village mayor was our first friend and he loved our T-shirts, so that helped. We focused on making the customers aware, because that's where the change needs to happen. The village is already two-thirds along the way of becoming plastic bag free.Our first attempts to get the government of Bali on board failed. So we thought, \"Hmm ... a petition with one million signatures. They can't ignore us, right?\"MW: Right!IW: But, who would have guessed one million signatures is, like, a thousand times a thousand?(Laughter)We got stuck \u2014 till we learned lesson number two: think outside the box. Someone mentioned that the Bali airport handles 16 million arrivals and departures a year.MW: But how do we get into the airport? And here comes lesson number three: persistence. Off we headed to the airport. We got past the janitor. And then it was his boss's boss, and then the assistant office manager, and then the office manager, and then ... we got shuffled down two levels and thought, well, here comes the janitor again.And after several days knocking on doors and just being kids on a mission, we finally got to the commercial manager of Bali airports. And we gave him the \"Bali of plastic bags\" speech, and being a very nice man, he said, [imitating the man's voice] \"I cannot believe what I'm about say, but I'm going to give authorization to collect signatures behind customs and immigrations.\"(Laughter)(Applause)IW: In our first hour and a half there, we got almost 1,000 signatures. How cool is that?Lesson number four: you need champions at all levels of society, from students to commercial managers to famous people. And thanks to the attraction of Green School, we had access to a steady stream of celebrities. Ban Ki Moon taught us that Secretary-Generals of the United Nations don't sign petitions \u2014(Laughter)even if kids ask nicely. But he promised to spread the word, and now we work closely with the United Nations.MW: Jane Goodall taught us the power of a people's network. She started with just one Roots & Shoots group and now she has 4,000 groups around the world. We are one of them. She's a real inspiration.If you're a fellow Rotarian, nice to meet you. We're Interactors, the youngest department of Rotary International.IW: But we have also learned much about patience,MW: how to deal with frustrations,IW: leadership,MW: teamwork,IW: friendship,MW: we learned more about the Balinese and their cultureIW: and we learned about the importance of commitment.MW: It's not always easy. Sometimes it does get a little bit hard to walk your talk.IW: But last year, we did exactly that. We went to India to give a talk, and our parents took us to visit the former private house of Mahatma Gandhi. We learned about the power of hunger strikes he did to reach his goals. Yes, by the end of the tour, when we met our parents again, we both made a decision and said, \"We're going on a hunger strike!\"(Laughter)MW: And you can probably imagine their faces. It took a lot of convincing, and not only to our parents but to our friends and to our teachers as well. Isabel and I were serious about doing this. So we met with a nutritionist, and we came up with a compromise of not eating from sunrise to sunset every day until the governor of Bali would agree to meet with us to talk about how to stop plastic bags on Bali.IW: Our \"mogak makan,\" as it is called in Bahasa Indonesia, started. We used social media to support our goal and already on day two, police started to come to our home and school. What were these two girls doing? We knew we weren't making the governor look his best by doing this food strike \u2014 we could have gone to jail. But, hey, it worked. Twenty-four hours later, we were picked up from school and escorted to the office of the governor.MW: And there he was \u2014(Applause)waiting for us to meet and speak, being all supportive and thankful for our willingness to care for the beauty and the environment of Bali.He signed a promise to help the people of Bali say no to plastic bags. And we are now friends, and on a regular basis, we remind him and his team of the promises he has made. And indeed, recently he stated and committed that Bali will be plastic bag free by 2018.(Applause)IW: Also, at the International Airport of Bali, one of our supporters is planning to start a plastic bag-free policy by 2016.MW: Stop handing out free plastic bags and bring in your own reusable bag is our next message to change that mindset of the public.IW: Our short-term campaign, \"One Island / One Voice,\" is all about this. We check and recognize the shops and restaurants that have declared themselves a plastic bag-free zone, and we put this sticker at their entrance and publish their names on social media and some important magazines on Bali. And conversely, that highlights those who do not have the sticker.(Laughter)MW: So, why are we actually telling you all of this? Well, partly, it is because we are proud of the results that, together with our team, we have been able to reach. But also because along the way, we have learned that kids can do things. We can make things happen. Isabel and I were only 10 and 12 years old when we started this. We never had a business plan, nor a fixed strategy, nor any hidden agendas \u2014 just the idea in front of us and a group of friends working with us. All we wanted to do was stop those plastic bags from wrapping and suffocating our beautiful home. Kids have a boundless energy and a motivation to be the change the world needs.IW: So to all the kids of this beautiful but challenging world: go for it! Make that difference. We're not telling you it's going to be easy. We're telling you it's going to be worth it. Us kids may only be 25 percent of the world's population, but we are 100 percent of the future.MW: We still have a lot of work to do, but know that we still not stop until the first question asked when arriving at the Bali airports will beBoth: \"Welcome to Bali, do you have nay plastic bags to declare?\"(Laughter)Om shanti shanti shanti om.Thank you.(Applause)", "id": 2418, "subtitle":

"https://www.ted.com/talks/linda_liukas_a_delightful_way_to_teach_kids_about_computers", "transcript": "Code is the next universal language. In the seventies, it was punk music that drove the whole generation. In the eighties, it was probably money. But for my generation of people, software is the interface to our imagination and our world. And that means that we need a radically, radically more diverse set of people to build those products, to not see computers as mechanical and lonely and boring and magic, to see them as things that they can tinker and turn around and twist, and so forth.My personal journey into the world of programming and technology started at the tender age of 14. I had this mad teenage crush on an older man, and the older man in question just happened to be the then Vice President of the United States, Mr. Al Gore. And I did what every single teenage girl would want to do. I wanted to somehow express all of this love, so I built him a website, it's over here. And in 2001, there was no Tumblr, there was no Facebook, there was no Pinterest. So I needed to learn to code in order to express all of this longing and loving.And that is how programming started for me. It started as a means of self-expression. Just like when I was smaller, I would use crayons and legos. And when I was older, I would use guitar lessons and theater plays. But then, there were other things to get excited about, like poetry and knitting socks and conjugating French irregular verbs and coming up with make-believe worlds and Bertrand Russell and his philosophy. And I started to be one of those people who felt that computers are boring and technical and lonely.Here's what I think today. Little girls don't know that they are not supposed to like computers. Little girls are amazing. They are really, really good at concentrating on things and being exact and they ask amazing questions like, \"What?\" and \"Why?\" and \"How?\" and \"What if?\" And they don't know that they are not supposed to like computers. It's the parents who do. It's us parents who feel like computer science is this esoteric, weird science discipline that only belongs to the mystery makers. That it's almost as far removed from everyday life as, say, nuclear physics.And they are partly right about that. There's a lot of syntax and controls and data structures and algorithms and practices, protocols and paradigms in programming. And we as a community, we've made computers smaller and smaller. We've built layers and layers of abstraction on top of each other between the man and the machine to the point that we no longer have any idea how computers work or how to talk to them. And we do teach our kids how the human body works, we teach them how the combustion engine functions and we even tell them that if you want to really be an astronaut you can become one. But when the kid comes to us and asks, \"So, what is a bubble sort algorithm?\" Or, \"How does the computer know what happens when I press 'play,' how does it know which video to show?\" Or, \"Linda, is Internet a place?\" We adults, we grow oddly silent. \"It's magic,\" some of us say. \"It's too complicated,\" the others say.Well, it's neither. It's not magic and it's not complicated. It all just happened really, really, really fast. Computer scientists built these amazing, beautiful machines, but they made them very, very foreign to us, and also the language we speak to the computers so that we don't know how to speak to the computers anymore without our fancy user interfaces.And that's why no one recognized that when I was conjugating French irregular verbs, I was actually practicing my pattern recognition skills. And when I was excited about knitting, I actually was following a sequence of symbolic commands that included loops inside of them. And that Bertrand Russell's lifelong quest to find an exact language between English and mathematics found its home inside of a computer. I was a programmer, but no one knew it.The kids of today, they tap, swipe and pinch their way through the world. But unless we give them tools to build with computers, we are raising only consumers instead of creators.This whole quest led me to this little girl. Her name is Ruby, she is six years old. She is completely fearless, imaginative and a little bit bossy. And every time I would run into a problem in trying to teach myself programming like, \"What is object-oriented design or what is garbage collection?\", I would try to imagine how a six-year-old little girl would explain the problem.And I wrote a book about her and I illustrated it and the things Ruby taught me go like this. Ruby taught me that you're not supposed to be afraid of the bugs under your bed. And even the biggest of the problems are a group of tiny problems stuck together. And Ruby also introduced me to her friends, the colorful side of the Internet culture. She has friends like the Snow Leopard, who is beautiful but doesn't want to play with the other kids. And she has friends like the green robots that are really friendly but super messy. And she has friends like Linux the penguin who's really ruthlessly efficient, but somewhat hard to understand. And idealistic foxes, and so on.In Ruby's world, you learn technology through play. And, for instance, computers are really good at repeating stuff, so the way Ruby would teach loops goes like this. This is Ruby's favorite dance move, it goes, \"Clap, clap, stomp, stomp clap, clap and jump.\" And you learn counter loops by repeating that four times. And you learn while loops by repeating that sequence while I'm standing on one leg. And you learn until loops by repeating that sequence until mom gets really mad. (Laughter) And most of all, you learn that there are no ready answers.When coming up with the curriculum for Ruby's world, I needed to really ask the kids how they see the world and what kind of questions they have and I would organize play testing sessions. I would start by showing the kids these four pictures. I would show them a picture of a car, a grocery store, a dog and a toilet. And I would ask, \"Which one of these do you think is a computer?\" And the kids would be very conservative and go, \"None of these is a computer. I know what a computer is: it's that glowing box in front of which mom or dad spends way too much time.\" But then we would talk and we would discover that actually, a car is a computer, it has a navigation system inside of it. And a dog \u2014 a dog might not be a computer, but it has a collar and the collar might have a computer inside of it. And grocery stores, they have so many different kinds of computers, like the cashier system and the burglar alarms. And kids, you know what? In Japan, toilets are computers and there's even hackers who hack them. (Laughter)And we go further and I give them these little stickers with an on/off button on them. And I tell the kids, \"Today you have this magic ability to make anything in this room into a computer.\" And again, the kids go, \"Sounds really hard, I don't know the right answer for this.\" But I tell them, \"Don't worry, your parents don't know the right answer, either. They've just started to hear about this thing called The Internet of Things. But you kids, you are going to be the ones who are really going to live up in a world where everything is a computer.\"And then I had this little girl who came to me and took a bicycle lamp and she said, \"This bicycle lamp, if it were a computer, it would change colors.\" And I said, \"That's a really good idea, what else could it do?\" And she thinks and she thinks, and she goes, \"If this bicycle lamp were a computer, we could go on a biking trip with my father and we would sleep in a tent and this biking lamp could also be a movie projector.\" And that's the moment I'm looking for, the moment when the kid realizes that the world is definitely not ready yet, that a really awesome way of making the world more ready is by building technology and that each one of us can be a part of that change.Final story, we also built a computer. And we got to know the bossy CPU and the helpful RAM and ROM that help it remember things. And after we've assembled our computer together, we also design an application for it. And my favorite story is this little boy, he's six years old and his favorite thing in the world is to be an astronaut. And the boy, he has these huge headphones on and he's completely immersed in his tiny paper computer because you see, he's built his own intergalactic planetary navigation application. And his father, the lone astronaut in the Martian orbit, is on the other side of the room and the boy's important mission is to bring the father safely back to earth. And these kids are going to have a profoundly different view of the world and the way we build it with technology.Finally, the more approachable, the more inclusive, and the more diverse we make the world of technology, the more colorful and better the world will look like. So, imagine with me, for a moment, a world where the stories we tell about how things get made don't only include the twentysomething-year-old Silicon Valley boys, but also Kenyan schoolgirls and Norwegian librarians. Imagine a world where the little Ada Lovelaces of tomorrow, who live in a permanent reality of 1s and 0s, they grow up to be very optimistic and brave about technology. They embrace the powers and the opportunities and the limitations of the world. A world of technology that is wonderful, whimsical and a tiny bit weird.When I was a girl, I wanted to be a storyteller. I loved make-believe worlds and my favorite thing to do was to wake up in the mornings in Moominvalley. In the afternoons, I would roam around the Tatooines. And in the evenings, I would go to sleep in Narnia. And programming turned out to be the perfect profession for me. I still create worlds. Instead of stories, I do them with code.Programming gives me this amazing power to build my whole little universe with its own rules and paradigms and practices. Create something out of nothing with the pure power of logic.Thank you.(Applause)", "id": 2417, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:12.678 -->

eighties, it was probably money.\n\n00:00:23.318 --> 00:00:25.654\nBut for my generation of people,\n\n00:00:25.678 --> 00:00:30.494\nsoftware is the interface\nto our imagination and our world.\n\n00:00:30.518 --> 00:00:32.214\nAnd that means that we need\n\n00:00:32.238 --> 00:00:35.494\na radically, radically\nmore diverse set of people\n\n00:00:35.518 --> 00:00:37.294\nto build those products,\n\n00:00:37.318 --> 00:00:42.254\nto not see computers as mechanical\nand lonely and boring and magic,\n\n00:00:42.278 --> 00:00:44.254\nto see them as things\nthat they can tinker\n\n00:00:44.278 --> 00:00:46.718\nand turn around and twist,\nand so forth.\n\n00:00:47.678 --> 00:00:51.454\nMy personal journey into the world\nof programming and technology\n\n00:00:51.478 --> 00:00:54.454\nstarted at the tender age of 14.\n\n00:00:54.478 --> 00:00:58.574\nI had this mad teenage crush\non an older man,\n\n00:00:58.598 --> 00:01:00.934\nand the older man in question\njust happened to be\n\n00:01:00.958 --> 00:01:05.374\nthe then Vice President\nof the United States, Mr. Al Gore.\n\n00:01:05.398 --> 00:01:08.454\nAnd I did what every single\nteenage girl would want to do.\n\n00:01:08.478 --> 00:01:10.694\nI wanted to somehow\nexpress all of this love,\n\n00:01:10.718 --> 00:01:13.294\nso I built him a website, it's over here.\n\n00:01:13.318 --> 00:01:16.254\nAnd in 2001, there was no Tumblr,\n\n00:01:16.277 --> 00:01:18.534\nthere was no Facebook,\nthere was no Pinterest.\n\n00:01:18.558 --> 00:01:20.694\nSo I needed to learn to code\n\n00:01:20.718 --> 00:01:24.094\nin order to express\nall of this longing and loving.\n\n00:01:24.118 --> 00:01:26.454\nAnd that is how programming\nstarted for me.\n\n00:01:26.478 --> 00:01:29.014\nIt started as a means of self-expression.\n\n00:01:29.038 --> 00:01:32.654\nJust like when I was smaller,\nI would use crayons and legos.\n\n00:01:32.678 --> 00:01:37.278\nAnd when I was older, I would use\nguitar lessons and theater plays.\n\n00:01:37.878 --> 00:01:40.854\nBut then, there were other things\nto get excited about,\n\n00:01:40.878 --> 00:01:43.294\nlike poetry and knitting socks\n\n00:01:43.318 --> 00:01:46.614\nand conjugating French irregular verbs\n\n00:01:46.638 --> 00:01:48.494\nand coming up with make-believe worlds\n\n00:01:48.518 --> 00:01:51.654\nand Bertrand Russell and his philosophy.\n\n00:01:51.678 --> 00:01:53.574\nAnd I started to be one of those people\n\n00:01:53.598 --> 00:01:57.278\nwho felt that computers\nare boring and technical and lonely.\n\n00:01:58.078 --> 00:01:59.894\nHere's what I think today.\n\n00:01:59.918 --> 00:02:03.974\nLittle girls don't know that they\nare not supposed to like computers.\n\n00:02:03.998 --> 00:02:05.254\nLittle girls are amazing.\n\n00:02:05.278 --> 00:02:09.414\nThey are really, really good\nat concentrating on things\n\n00:02:09.438 --> 00:02:12.694\nand being exact and they ask\namazing questions like,\n\n00:02:12.718 --> 00:02:15.294\n\"What?\" and \"Why?\"\nand \"How?\" and \"What if?\"\n\n00:02:15.318 --> 00:02:18.998\nAnd they don't know that they\nare not supposed to like computers.\n\n00:02:19.718 --> 00:02:21.654\nIt's the parents who do.\n\n00:02:21.678 --> 00:02:22.973\nIt's us parents who feel\n\n00:02:22.997 --> 00:02:28.094\nlike computer science\nis this esoteric, weird science discipline\n\n00:02:28.118 --> 00:02:31.774\nthat only belongs to the mystery makers.\n\n00:02:31.798 --> 00:02:34.534\nThat it's almost as far removed\nfrom everyday life\n\n00:02:34.558 --> 00:02:37.094\nas, say, nuclear physics.\n\n00:02:37.118 --> 00:02:39.574\nAnd they are partly right about that.\n\n00:02:39.598 --> 00:02:43.094\nThere's a lot of syntax\nand controls and data structures\n\n00:02:43.118 --> 00:02:45.774\nand algorithms and practices,\n\n00:02:45.798 --> 00:02:48.374\nprotocols and paradigms in programming.\n\n00:02:48.398 -->

toilet.\n\n00:06:33.238 --> 00:06:36.478\nAnd I would ask, \"Which one of these\ndo you think is a computer?\"\n\n00:06:37.438 --> 00:06:40.174\nAnd the kids would be\nvery conservative and go,\n\n00:06:40.198 --> 00:06:41.974\n\"None of these is a computer.\n\n00:06:41.998 --> 00:06:43.654\nI know what a computer is:\n\n00:06:43.678 --> 00:06:45.014\nit's that glowing box\n\n00:06:45.038 --> 00:06:48.654\nin front of which mom or dad\nspends way too much time.\"\n\n00:06:48.678 --> 00:06:50.174\nBut then we would talk\n\n00:06:50.198 --> 00:06:53.014\nand we would discover\nthat actually, a car is a computer,\n\n00:06:53.038 --> 00:06:55.414\nit has a navigation system inside of it.\n\n00:06:55.438 --> 00:06:58.214\nAnd a dog -- a dog\nmight not be a computer,\n\n00:06:58.238 --> 00:06:59.454\nbut it has a collar\n\n00:06:59.478 --> 00:07:02.094\nand the collar might have\na computer inside of it.\n\n00:07:02.118 --> 00:07:05.574\nAnd grocery stores, they have\nso many different kinds of computers,\n\n00:07:05.598 --> 00:07:09.014\nlike the cashier system\nand the burglar alarms.\n\n00:07:09.038 --> 00:07:10.374\nAnd kids, you know what?\n\n00:07:10.398 --> 00:07:12.934\nIn Japan, toilets are computers\n\n00:07:12.958 --> 00:07:14.854\nand there's even hackers who hack them.\n\n00:07:14.878 --> 00:07:16.654\n(Laughter)\n\n00:07:16.678 --> 00:07:17.894\nAnd we go further\n\n00:07:17.918 --> 00:07:21.134\nand I give them these little stickers\nwith an on/off button on them.\n\n00:07:21.158 --> 00:07:24.774\nAnd I tell the kids,\n\"Today you have this magic ability\n\n00:07:24.798 --> 00:07:28.414\nto make anything in this room\ninto a computer.\"\n\n00:07:28.438 --> 00:07:29.774\nAnd again, the kids go,\n\n00:07:29.798 --> 00:07:32.694\n\"Sounds really hard,\nI don't know the right answer for this.\"\n\n00:07:32.718 --> 00:07:34.294\nBut I tell them, \"Don't worry,\n\n00:07:34.318 --> 00:07:36.894\nyour parents don't know\nthe right answer, either.\n\n00:07:36.918 --> 00:07:39.134\nThey've just started\nto hear about this thing\n\n00:07:39.158 --> 00:07:41.374\ncalled The Internet of Things.\n\n00:07:41.398 --> 00:07:43.374\nBut you kids,\nyou are going to be the ones\n\n00:07:43.398 --> 00:07:47.774\nwho are really going to live up in a world\nwhere everything is a computer.\"\n\n00:07:47.798 --> 00:07:50.014\nAnd then I had this little girl\nwho came to me\n\n00:07:50.038 --> 00:07:51.334\nand took a bicycle lamp\n\n00:07:51.358 --> 00:07:55.574\nand she said, \"This bicycle lamp,\nif it were a computer,\n\n00:07:55.598 --> 00:07:57.614\nit would change colors.\"\n\n00:07:57.638 --> 00:08:00.654\nAnd I said, \"That's a really good idea,\nwhat else could it do?\"\n\n00:08:00.678 --> 00:08:02.414\nAnd she thinks and she thinks,\n\n00:08:02.438 --> 00:08:06.454\nand she goes, \"If this bicycle lamp\nwere a computer,\n\n00:08:06.478 --> 00:08:09.214\nwe could go on a biking trip\nwith my father\n\n00:08:09.238 --> 00:08:10.854\nand we would sleep in a tent\n\n00:08:10.878 --> 00:08:14.718\nand this biking lamp\ncould also be a movie projector.\"\n\n00:08:15.598 --> 00:08:17.558\nAnd that's the moment I'm looking for,\n\n00:08:18.358 --> 00:08:19.934\nthe moment when the kid realizes\n\n00:08:19.958 --> 00:08:22.334\nthat the world\nis definitely not ready yet,\n\n00:08:22.358 --> 00:08:25.334\nthat a really awesome way\nof making the world more ready\n\n00:08:25.358 --> 00:08:27.574\nis by building technology\n\n00:08:27.598 --> 00:08:30.358\nand that each one of us\ncan be a part of that change.\n\n00:08:31.158 --> 00:08:34.214\nFinal story, we also built a computer.\n\n00:08:34.238 --> 00:08:38.974\nAnd we got to know the bossy CPU\nand the helpful RAM and ROM\n\n00:08:38.998 --> 00:08:40.414\nthat help it remember things.\n\n00:08:40.438 --> 00:08:43.374\nAnd after we've assembled\nour computer together,\n\n00:08:43.398 --> 00:08:46.054\nwe also design an application for it.\n\n00:08:46.078 --> 00:08:48.093\nAnd my favorite story is this little boy,\n\n00:08:48.117 --> 00:08:49.374\nhe's six years old\n\n00:08:49.398 --> 00:08:52.517\nand his favorite thing in the world\nis to be an astronaut.\n\n00:08:53.078 --> 00:08:55.334\nAnd the boy, he has\nthese huge headphones on\n\n00:08:55.358 --> 00:08:58.614\nand he's completely immersed\nin his tiny paper computer\n\n00:08:58.638 --> 00:09:00.654\nbecause you see, he's built his own\n\n00:09:00.678 --> 00:09:04.974\nintergalactic planetary\nnavigation application.\n\n00:09:04.998 --> 00:09:08.134\nAnd his father, the lone astronaut\nin the Martian orbit,\n\n00:09:08.158 --> 00:09:10.014\nis on the other side of the room\n\n00:09:10.038 --> 00:09:11.654\nand the boy's important mission\n\n00:09:11.678 --> 00:09:14.598\nis to bring the father\nsafely back to earth.\n\n00:09:15.718 --> 00:09:19.174\nAnd these kids are going to have\na profoundly different view of the world\n\n00:09:19.198 --> 00:09:21.598\nand the way we build it with technology.\n\n00:09:22.798 --> 00:09:26.654\nFinally, the more approachable,\nthe more inclusive,\n\n00:09:26.678 --> 00:09:30.054\nand the more diverse\nwe make the world of technology,\n\n00:09:30.078 --> 00:09:34.054\nthe more colorful and better\nthe world will look like.\n\n00:09:34.078 --> 00:09:36.654\nSo, imagine with me, for a moment,\n\n00:09:36.678 --> 00:09:39.254\na world where the stories we tell\n\n00:09:39.278 --> 00:09:42.294\nabout how things get made\ndon't only include\n\n00:09:42.318 --> 00:09:44.734\nthe twentysomething-year-old\nSilicon Valley boys,\n\n00:09:44.758 --> 00:09:49.158\nbut also Kenyan schoolgirls\nand Norwegian librarians.\n\n00:09:49.958 --> 00:09:54.174\nImagine a world where\nthe little Ada Lovelaces of tomorrow,\n\n00:09:54.198 --> 00:09:57.414\nwho live in a permanent\nreality of 1s and 0s,\n\n00:09:57.438 --> 00:10:02.054\nthey grow up to be very optimistic\nand brave about technology.\n\n00:10:02.078 --> 00:10:05.454\nThey embrace the powers\nand the opportunities\n\n00:10:05.478 --> 00:10:07.078\nand the limitations of the world.\n\n00:10:07.638 --> 00:10:11.774\nA world of technology\nthat is wonderful, whimsical\n\n00:10:11.798 --> 00:10:13.438\nand a tiny bit weird.\n\n00:10:15.078 --> 00:10:16.574\nWhen I was a girl,\n\n00:10:16.598 --> 00:10:18.614\nI wanted to be a storyteller.\n\n00:10:18.638 --> 00:10:20.214\nI loved make-believe worlds\n\n00:10:20.238 --> 00:10:21.854\nand my favorite thing to do\n\n00:10:21.878 --> 00:10:25.934\nwas to wake up in the mornings\nin Moominvalley.\n\n00:10:25.958 --> 00:10:29.078\nIn the afternoons,\nI would roam around the Tatooines.\n\n00:10:29.278 --> 00:10:32.158\nAnd in the evenings,\nI would go to sleep in Narnia.\n\n00:10:33.358 --> 00:10:36.558\nAnd programming turned out\nto be the perfect profession for me.\n\n00:10:37.678 --> 00:10:39.614\nI still create worlds.\n\n00:10:39.638 --> 00:10:42.598\nInstead of stories, I do them with code.\n\n00:10:43.598 --> 00:10:46.654\nProgramming gives me this amazing power\n\n00:10:46.678 --> 00:10:49.054\nto build my whole little universe\n\n00:10:49.078 --> 00:10:53.038\nwith its own rules\nand paradigms and practices.\n\n00:10:54.078 --> 00:10:58.038\nCreate something out of nothing\nwith the pure power of logic.\n\n00:10:58.878 --> 00:11:00.094\nThank you.\n\n00:11:00.118 -->

boy in Lima, my grandfather told me a legend of the Spanish conquest of Peru. Atahualpa, emperor of the Inca, had been captured and killed. Pizarro and his conquistadors had grown rich, and tales of their conquest and glory had reached Spain and was bringing new waves of Spaniards, hungry for gold and glory. They would go into towns and ask the Inca, \"Where's another civilization we can conquer? Where's more gold?\"And the Inca, out of vengeance, told them, \"Go to the Amazon. You'll find all the gold you want there. In fact, there is a city called Paititi \u2014 El Dorado in Spanish \u2014 made entirely of gold.\"The Spanish set off into the jungle, but the few that return come back with stories, stories of powerful shamans, of warriors with poisoned arrows, of trees so tall they blotted out the sun, spiders that ate birds, snakes that swallowed men whole and a river that boiled.All this became a childhood memory. And years passed. I'm working on my PhD at SMU, trying to understand Peru's geothermal energy potential, when I remember this legend, and I began asking that question. Could the boiling river exist?I asked colleagues from universities, the government, oil, gas and mining companies, and the answer was a unanimous no. And this makes sense. You see, boiling rivers do exist in the world, but they're generally associated with volcanoes. You need a powerful heat source to produce such a large geothermal manifestation. And as you can see from the red dots here, which are volcanoes, we don't have volcanoes in the Amazon, nor in most of Peru. So it follows: We should not expect to see a boiling river.Telling this same story at a family dinner, my aunt tells me, \"But no, Andr\u00e9s, I've been there. I've swum in that river.\"(Laughter)Then my uncle jumps in. \"No, Andr\u00e9s, she's not kidding. You see, you can only swim in it after a very heavy rain, and it's protected by a powerful shaman. Your aunt, she's friends with his wife.\"(Laughter)\"\u00bfC\u00f3mo?\" [\"Huh?\"]You know, despite all my scientific skepticism, I found myself hiking into the jungle, guided by my aunt, over 700 kilometers away from the nearest volcanic center, and well, honestly, mentally preparing myself to behold the legendary \"warm stream of the Amazon.\"But then ... I heard something, a low surge that got louder and louder as we came closer. It sounded like ocean waves constantly crashing, and as we got closer, I saw smoke, vapor, coming up through the trees. And then, I saw this.I immediately grabbed for my thermometer, and the average temperatures in the river were 86 degrees C. This is not quite the 100-degree C boiling but definitely close enough. The river flowed hot and fast. I followed it upriver and was led by, actually, the shaman's apprentice to the most sacred site on the river. And this is what's bizarre \u2014 It starts off as a cold stream. And here, at this site, is the home of the Yacumama, mother of the waters, a giant serpent spirit who births hot and cold water. And here we find a hot spring, mixing with cold stream water underneath her protective motherly jaws and thus bringing their legends to life.The next morning, I woke up and \u2014(Laughter)I asked for tea. I was handed a mug, a tea bag and, well, pointed towards the river. To my surprise, the water was clean and had a pleasant taste, which is a little weird for geothermal systems.What was amazing is that the locals had always known about this place, and that I was by no means the first outsider to see it. It was just part of their everyday life. They drink its water. They take in its vapor. They cook with it, clean with it, even make their medicines with it.I met the shaman, and he seemed like an extension of the river and his jungle. He asked for my intentions and listened carefully. Then, to my tremendous relief \u2014 I was freaking out, to be honest with you \u2014 a smile began to snake across his face, and he just laughed.(Laughter)I had received the shaman's blessing to study the river, on the condition that after I take the water samples and analyze them in my lab, wherever I was in the world, that I pour the waters back into the ground so that, as the shaman said, the waters could find their way back home.I've been back every year since that first visit in 2011, and the fieldwork has been exhilarating, demanding and at times dangerous. One story was even featured in National Geographic Magazine. I was trapped on a small rock about the size of a sheet of paper in sandals and board shorts, in between an 80 degree C river and a hot spring that, well, looked like this, close to boiling. And on top of that, it was Amazon rain forest. Pshh, pouring rain, couldn't see a thing. The temperature differential made it all white. It was a whiteout. Intense.Now, after years of work, I'll soon be submitting my geophysical and geochemical studies for publication. And I'd like to share, today, with all of you here, on the TED stage, for the first time, some of these discoveries.Well, first off, it's not a legend. Surprise!(Laughter)When I first started the research, the satellite imagery was too low-resolution to be meaningful. There were just no good maps. Thanks to the support of the Google Earth team, I now have this. Not only that, the indigenous name of the river, Shanay-timpishka, \"boiled with the heat of the sun,\" indicating that I'm not the first to wonder why the river boils, and showing that humanity has always sought to explain the world around us.So why does the river boil?(Bubbling sounds)It actually took me three years to get that footage.Fault-fed hot springs. As we have hot blood running through our veins and arteries, so, too, the earth has hot water running through its cracks and faults. Where these arteries come to the surface, these earth arteries, we'll get geothermal manifestations: fumaroles, hot springs and in our case, the boiling river.What's truly incredible, though, is the scale of this place. Next time you cross the road, think about this. The river flows wider than a two-lane road along most of its path. It flows hot for 6.24 kilometers. Truly impressive. There are thermal pools larger than this TED stage, and that waterfall that you see there is six meters tall \u2014 and all with near-boiling water.We mapped the temperatures along the river, and this was by far the most demanding part of the fieldwork. And the results were just awesome. Sorry \u2014 the geoscientist in me coming out. And it showed this amazing trend. You see, the river starts off cold. It then heats up, cools back down, heats up, cools back down, heats up again, and then has this beautiful decay curve until it smashes into this cold river.Now, I understand not all of you are geothermal scientists, so to put it in more everyday terms: Everyone loves coffee. Yes? Good. Your regular cup of coffee, 54 degrees C, an extra-hot one, well, 60. So, put in coffee shop terms, the boiling river plots like this. There you have your hot coffee. Here you have your extra-hot coffee, and you can see that there's a bit point there where the river is still hotter than even the extra-hot coffee. And these are average water temperatures. We took these in the dry season to ensure the purest geothermal temperatures.But there's a magic number here that's not being shown, and that number is 47 degrees C, because that's where things start to hurt, and I know this from very personal experience. Above that temperature, you don't want to get in that water. You need to be careful. It can be deadly.I've seen all sorts of animals fall in, and what's shocking to me, is the process is pretty much the same. So they fall in and the first thing to go are the eyes. Eyes, apparently, cook very quickly. They turn this milky-white color. The stream is carrying them. They're trying to swim out, but their meat is cooking on the bone because it's so hot. So they're losing power, losing power, until finally they get to a point where hot water goes into their mouths and they cook from the inside out.(Laughter)A bit sadistic, aren't we? Jeez. Leave them marinating for a little longer. What's, again, amazing are these temperatures. They're similar to things that I've seen on volcanoes all over the world and even super-volcanoes like Yellowstone.But here's the thing: the data is showing that the boiling river exists independent of volcanism. It's neither magmatic or volcanic in origin, and again, over 700 kilometers away from the nearest volcanic center.How can a boiling river exist like this? I've asked geothermal experts and volcanologists for years, and I'm still unable to find another non-volcanic geothermal system of this magnitude. It's unique. It's special on a global scale. So, still \u2014 how does it work? Where do we get this heat? There's still more research to be done to better constrain the problem and better understand the system, but from what the data is telling us now, it looks to be the result of a large hydrothermal system.Basically, it works like this: So, the deeper you go into the earth, the hotter it gets. We refer to this as the geothermal gradient. The waters could be coming from as far away as glaciers in the Andes, then seeping down deep into the earth and coming out to form the boiling river after getting heated up from the geothermal gradient, all due to this unique geologic setting.Now, we found that in and around the river \u2014 this is working with colleagues from National Geographic, Dr. Spencer Wells, and Dr. Jon Eisen from UC Davis \u2014 we genetically sequenced the extremophile lifeforms living in and around the river, and have found new lifeforms, unique species living in the boiling river.But again, despite all of these studies, all of these discoveries and the legends, a question remains: What is the significance of the boiling river? What is the significance of this stationary cloud that always hovers over this patch of jungle? And what is the significance of a detail in a childhood legend?To the shaman and his community, it's a sacred site. To me, as a geoscientist, it's a unique geothermal phenomenon. But to the illegal loggers and cattle farmers, it's just another resource to exploit. And to the Peruvian government, it's just another stretch of unprotected land ready for development.My goal is to ensure that whoever controls this land understands the boiling river's uniqueness and significance. Because that's the question, one of significance. And the thing there is, we define significance. It's us. We have that power. We are the ones who draw that line between the sacred and the trivial. And in this age, where everything seems mapped, measured and studied, in this age of information, I remind you all that discoveries are not just made in the black void of the unknown but in the white noise of overwhelming data.There remains so much to explore. We live in an incredible world. So go out. Be curious. Because we do live in a world where shamans still sing to the spirits of the jungle, where rivers do boil and where legends do come to life.Thank you very much.(Applause)", "id": 2424, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:12.981 --> 00:00:14.624\nAs a boy in Lima,\n\n00:00:14.648 --> 00:00:16.759\nmy grandfather told me a legend\n\n00:00:16.783 --> 00:00:19.037\nof the Spanish conquest of Peru.\n\n00:00:19.965 --> 00:00:23.504\nAtahualpa, emperor of the Inca,\nhad been captured and killed.\n\n00:00:23.528 --> 00:00:26.511\nPizarro and his conquistadors\nhad grown rich,\n\n00:00:26.535 --> 00:00:29.721\nand tales of their conquest\nand glory had reached Spain\n\n00:00:29.745 --> 00:00:35.120\nand was bringing new waves of Spaniards,\nhungry for gold and glory.\n\n00:00:36.013 --> 00:00:38.911\nThey would go into towns and ask the Inca,\n\n00:00:38.935 --> 00:00:42.710\n\"Where's another civilization\nwe can conquer?

00:02:32.206\n\"But no, Andr\u00e9s, I've been there.\nI've swum in that river.\"\n\n00:02:32.856 --> 00:02:36.493\n(Laughter)\n\n00:02:36.517 --> 00:02:38.264\nThen my uncle jumps in.\n\n00:02:38.288 --> 00:02:41.018\n\"No, Andr\u00e9s, she's not kidding.\n\n00:02:41.042 --> 00:02:45.025\nYou see, you can only swim in it\nafter a very heavy rain,\n\n00:02:45.049 --> 00:02:48.295\nand it's protected by a powerful shaman.\n\n00:02:48.319 --> 00:02:50.636\nYour aunt, she's friends with his wife.\"\n\n00:02:51.215 --> 00:02:53.020\n(Laughter)\n\n00:02:53.044 --> 00:02:54.195\n\"\u00bfC\u00f3mo?\" [\"Huh?\"]\n\n00:02:54.219 --> 00:02:56.433\nYou know, despite all\nmy scientific skepticism,\n\n00:02:56.457 --> 00:03:00.889\nI found myself hiking into the jungle,\nguided by my aunt,\n\n00:03:00.913 --> 00:03:04.810\nover 700 kilometers away\nfrom the nearest volcanic center,\n\n00:03:04.834 --> 00:03:08.452\nand well, honestly,\nmentally preparing myself\n\n00:03:08.476 --> 00:03:12.852\nto behold the legendary\n\"warm stream of the Amazon.\"\n\n00:03:14.629 --> 00:03:16.250\nBut then ...\n\n00:03:16.274 --> 00:03:17.596\nI heard something,\n\n00:03:19.213 --> 00:03:20.662\na low surge\n\n00:03:22.305 --> 00:03:25.000\nthat got louder and louder\n\n00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:27.218\nas we came closer.\n\n00:03:28.258 --> 00:03:32.186\nIt sounded like ocean waves\nconstantly crashing,\n\n00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:36.895\nand as we got closer, I saw smoke, vapor,\ncoming up through the trees.\n\n00:03:36.919 --> 00:03:40.218\nAnd then, I saw this.\n\n00:03:41.749 --> 00:03:44.218\nI immediately grabbed for my thermometer,\n\n00:03:44.242 --> 00:03:47.519\nand the average temperatures in the river\n\n00:03:47.543 --> 00:03:49.530\nwere 86 degrees C.\n\n00:03:51.498 --> 00:03:54.765\nThis is not quite\nthe 100-degree C boiling\n\n00:03:54.789 --> 00:03:57.666\nbut definitely close enough.\n\n00:03:58.254 --> 00:04:01.346\nThe river flowed hot and fast.\n\n00:04:02.139 --> 00:04:05.787\nI followed it upriver and was led by,\nactually, the shaman's apprentice\n\n00:04:05.811 --> 00:04:07.595\nto the most sacred site on the river.\n\n00:04:07.619 --> 00:04:09.025\nAnd this is what's bizarre --\n\n00:04:09.049 --> 00:04:11.031\nIt starts off as a cold stream.\n\n00:04:11.460 --> 00:04:13.697\nAnd here, at this site,\n\n00:04:13.721 --> 00:04:15.888\nis the home of the Yacumama,\n\n00:04:15.912 --> 00:04:19.255\nmother of the waters,\na giant serpent spirit\n\n00:04:19.279 --> 00:04:21.352\nwho births hot and cold water.\n\n00:04:21.973 --> 00:04:26.385\nAnd here we find a hot spring,\n\n00:04:26.409 --> 00:04:31.767\nmixing with cold stream water\nunderneath her protective motherly jaws\n\n00:04:31.791 --> 00:04:35.036\nand thus bringing their legends to life.\n\n00:04:36.241 --> 00:04:38.219\nThe next morning, I woke up and --\n\n00:04:38.243 --> 00:04:40.462\n(Laughter)\n\n00:04:40.486 --> 00:04:42.517\nI asked for tea.\n\n00:04:42.541 --> 00:04:44.781\nI was handed a mug, a tea bag\n\n00:04:44.805 --> 00:04:47.133\nand, well, pointed towards the river.\n\n00:04:48.033 --> 00:04:52.542\nTo my surprise, the water was clean\nand had a pleasant taste,\n\n00:04:52.566 --> 00:04:55.560\nwhich is a little weird\nfor geothermal systems.\n\n00:04:56.399 --> 00:04:57.947\nWhat was amazing\n\n00:04:57.971 --> 00:05:00.955\nis that the locals had always\nknown about this place,\n\n00:05:00.979 --> 00:05:04.683\nand that I was by no means\nthe first outsider to see it.\n\n00:05:05.659 --> 00:05:08.596\nIt was just part of their everyday life.\n\n00:05:09.073 --> 00:05:11.767\nThey drink its water.\n\n00:05:11.791 --> 00:05:14.346\nThey take in its vapor.\n\n00:05:14.370 --> 00:05:16.061\nThey cook with it,\n\n00:05:16.085 --> 00:05:17.595\nclean with it,\n\n00:05:17.619 --> 00:05:19.417\neven make their medicines with it.\n\n00:05:21.052 --> 00:05:22.798\nI met the shaman,\n\n00:05:22.822 --> 00:05:27.011\nand he seemed like an extension\nof the river and his jungle.\n\n00:05:27.806 --> 00:05:29.630\nHe asked for my intentions\n\n00:05:30.567 --> 00:05:32.146\nand listened carefully.\n\n00:05:33.220 --> 00:05:36.331\nThen, to my tremendous relief --\n\n00:05:36.355 --> 00:05:39.902\nI was freaking out,\nto be honest with you --\n\n00:05:39.926 --> 00:05:44.205\na smile began to snake across his face,\nand he just laughed.\n\n00:05:44.229 --> 00:05:46.526\n(Laughter)\n\n00:05:47.754 --> 00:05:52.349\nI had received the shaman's blessing\nto study the river,\n\n00:05:52.373 --> 00:05:55.777\non the condition that after I take\nthe water samples\n\n00:05:55.801 --> 00:05:57.317\nand analyze them in my lab,\n\n00:05:57.341 --> 00:05:59.151\nwherever I was in the world,\n\n00:06:00.223 --> 00:06:03.989\nthat I pour the waters\nback into the ground\n\n00:06:04.013 --> 00:06:06.060\nso that, as the shaman said,\n\n00:06:06.084 --> 00:06:08.829\nthe waters could find their way back home.\n\n00:06:11.230 --> 00:06:14.817\nI've been back every year\nsince that first visit in 2011,\n\n00:06:14.841 --> 00:06:18.266\nand the fieldwork has been exhilarating,\n\n00:06:18.290 --> 00:06:22.087\ndemanding and at times dangerous.\n\n00:06:22.871 --> 00:06:26.086\nOne story was even featured\nin National Geographic Magazine.\n\n00:06:26.110 --> 00:06:30.197\nI was trapped on a small rock\nabout the size of a sheet of paper\n\n00:06:30.221 --> 00:06:32.261\nin sandals and board shorts,\n\n00:06:32.285 --> 00:06:34.691\nin between an 80 degree C river\n\n00:06:34.715 --> 00:06:38.444\nand a hot spring that, well,\nlooked like this, close to boiling.\n\n00:06:39.028 --> 00:06:42.566\nAnd on top of that,\nit was Amazon rain forest.\n\n00:06:43.164 --> 00:06:45.670\nPshh, pouring rain, couldn't see a thing.\n\n00:06:45.694 --> 00:06:49.256\nThe temperature differential\nmade it all white. It was a whiteout.\n\n00:06:50.914 --> 00:06:52.319\nIntense.\n\n00:06:54.116 --> 00:06:56.554\nNow, after years of work,\n\n00:06:56.578 --> 00:07:02.220\nI'll soon be submitting my geophysical\nand geochemical studies for publication.\n\n00:07:03.005 --> 00:07:06.980\nAnd I'd like to share, today,\nwith all of you here, on the TED stage,\n\n00:07:07.004 --> 00:07:10.194\nfor the first time,\nsome of these discoveries.\n\n00:07:11.298 --> 00:07:13.829\nWell, first off, it's not a legend.\n\n00:07:14.426 --> 00:07:15.600\nSurprise!\n\n00:07:15.624 --> 00:07:17.949\n(Laughter)\n\n00:07:17.973 --> 00:07:20.487\nWhen I first started the research,\n\n00:07:20.511 --> 00:07:23.490\nthe satellite imagery was too\nlow-resolution to be meaningful.\n\n00:07:23.514 --> 00:07:25.142\nThere were just no good maps.\n\n00:07:25.712 --> 00:07:28.103\nThanks to the support\nof the Google Earth team,\n\n00:07:28.127 --> 00:07:29.472\nI now have this.\n\n00:07:31.209 --> 00:07:36.559\nNot only that, the indigenous name\nof the river, Shanay-timpishka,\n\n00:07:37.496 --> 00:07:40.226\n\"boiled with the heat of the sun,\"\n\n00:07:41.498 --> 00:07:46.877\nindicating that I'm not the first\nto wonder why the river boils,\n\n00:07:46.901 --> 00:07:50.128\nand showing that humanity\nhas always sought to explain\n\n00:07:50.152 --> 00:07:51.691\nthe world around us.\n\n00:07:53.484 --> 00:07:55.882\nSo why does the river boil?\n\n00:07:55.906 --> 00:08:00.319\n(Bubbling sounds)\n\n00:08:00.343 --> 00:08:02.838\nIt actually took me three years\nto get that footage.\n\n00:08:04.837 --> 00:08:06.442\nFault-fed hot springs.\n\n00:08:07.583 --> 00:08:11.216\nAs we have hot blood running\nthrough our veins and arteries,\n\n00:08:11.240 --> 00:08:16.288\nso, too, the earth has hot water\nrunning through its cracks and faults.\n\n00:08:17.120 --> 00:08:20.715\nWhere these arteries come to the surface,\nthese earth arteries,\n\n00:08:20.739 --> 00:08:23.113\nwe'll get geothermal manifestations:\n\n00:08:23.137 --> 00:08:27.157\nfumaroles, hot springs\nand in our case, the boiling river.\n\n00:08:28.417 --> 00:08:32.517\nWhat's truly incredible, though,\nis the scale of this place.\n\n00:08:33.179 --> 00:08:35.525\nNext time you cross the road,\nthink about this.\n\n00:08:36.485 --> 00:08:39.157\nThe river flows wider than a two-lane road\n\n00:08:39.181 --> 00:08:41.045\nalong most of its path.\n\n00:08:41.632 --> 00:08:46.975\nIt flows hot for 6.24 kilometers.\n\n00:08:48.181 --> 00:08:49.690\nTruly impressive.\n\n00:08:51.035 --> 00:08:54.035\nThere are thermal pools\nlarger than this TED stage,\n\n00:08:54.059 --> 00:08:56.535\nand that waterfall that you see there\n\n00:08:56.559 --> 00:08:58.597\nis six meters tall --\n\n00:08:59.342 --> 00:09:02.634\nand all with near-boiling water.\n\n00:09:04.201 --> 00:09:06.257\nWe mapped the temperatures\nalong the river,\n\n00:09:06.281 --> 00:09:09.399\nand this was by far the most\ndemanding part of the fieldwork.\n\n00:09:09.824 --> 00:09:13.511\nAnd the results were just awesome.\n\n00:09:13.535 --> 00:09:16.688\nSorry -- the geoscientist\nin me coming out.\n\n00:09:16.712 --> 00:09:19.138\nAnd it showed this amazing trend.\n\n00:09:19.162 --> 00:09:21.378\nYou see, the river starts off cold.\n\n00:09:21.402 --> 00:09:24.397\nIt then heats up, cools back down,\nheats up, cools back down,\n\n00:09:24.421 --> 00:09:27.039\nheats up again, and then has\nthis beautiful decay curve\n\n00:09:27.063 --> 00:09:29.435\nuntil it smashes into this cold river.\n\n00:09:30.497 --> 00:09:33.291\nNow, I understand not all of you\nare geothermal scientists,\n\n00:09:33.315 --> 00:09:35.540\nso to put it in more everyday terms:\n\n00:09:36.183 --> 00:09:38.316\nEveryone loves coffee.\n\n00:09:38.340 --> 00:09:39.609\nYes? Good.\n\n00:09:40.475 --> 00:09:44.158\nYour regular cup of coffee, 54 degrees C,\n\n00:09:44.182 --> 00:09:46.292\nan extra-hot one, well, 60.\n\n00:09:46.854 --> 00:09:49.025\nSo, put in coffee shop terms,\n\n00:09:49.049 --> 00:09:51.612\nthe boiling river plots like this.\n\n00:09:52.359 --> 00:09:53.858\nThere you have your hot coffee.\n\n00:09:54.864 --> 00:09:56.588\nHere you have your extra-hot coffee,\n\n00:09:56.612 --> 00:09:58.786\nand you can see\nthat there's a bit point there\n\n00:09:58.810 --> 00:10:01.798\nwhere the river is still hotter\nthan even the extra-hot coffee.\n\n00:10:01.822 --> 00:10:03.814\nAnd these are average water temperatures.\n\n00:10:03.838 --> 00:10:08.037\nWe took these in the dry season to ensure\nthe purest geothermal temperatures.\n\n00:10:08.561 --> 00:10:11.181\nBut there's a magic number here\nthat's not being shown,\n\n00:10:11.205 --> 00:10:13.735\nand that number is 47 degrees C,\n\n00:10:14.814 --> 00:10:17.336\nbecause that's where things start to hurt,\n\n00:10:17.360 --> 00:10:21.533\nand I know this from very\npersonal experience.\n\n00:10:22.144 --> 00:10:24.970\nAbove that temperature,\nyou don't want to get in that water.\n\n00:10:24.994 --> 00:10:26.656\nYou need to be careful.\n\n00:10:26.680 --> 00:10:27.995\nIt can be deadly.\n\n00:10:28.662 --> 00:10:30.953\nI've seen all sorts of animals fall in,\n\n00:10:30.977 --> 00:10:35.156\nand what's shocking to me,\nis the process is pretty much the same.\n\n00:10:35.856 --> 00:10:38.537\nSo they fall in and the first thing\nto go are the eyes.\n\n00:10:38.561 --> 00:10:41.928\nEyes, apparently, cook very quickly.\nThey turn this milky-white color.\n\n00:10:41.952 --> 00:10:43.302\nThe stream is carrying them.\n\n00:10:43.326 --> 00:10:46.389\nThey're trying to swim out,\nbut their meat is cooking on the bone\n\n00:10:46.413 --> 00:10:47.579\nbecause it's so hot.\n\n00:10:47.603 --> 00:10:49.448\nSo they're losing power, losing power,\n\n00:10:49.472 --> 00:10:52.862\nuntil finally they get to a point\nwhere hot water goes into their mouths\n\n00:10:52.886 --> 00:10:55.107\nand they cook from the inside out.\n\n00:10:55.398 --> 00:11:00.630\n(Laughter)\n\n00:11:00.654 --> 00:11:02.773\nA bit sadistic, aren't we?\n\n00:11:02.797 --> 00:11:04.137\nJeez.\n\n00:11:05.320 --> 00:11:07.938\nLeave them marinating for a little longer.\n\n00:11:09.426 --> 00:11:12.154\nWhat's, again, amazing\nare these temperatures.\n\n00:11:12.178 --> 00:11:15.656\nThey're similar to things that I've seen\non volcanoes all over the world\n\n00:11:15.680 --> 00:11:18.217\nand even super-volcanoes like Yellowstone.\n\n00:11:18.854 --> 00:11:20.162\nBut here's the thing:\n\n00:11:22.131 --> 00:11:27.130\nthe data is showing\nthat the boiling river exists\n\n00:11:27.154 --> 00:11:29.444\nindependent of volcanism.\n\n00:11:30.449 --> 00:11:33.869\nIt's neither magmatic\nor volcanic in origin,\n\n00:11:35.680 --> 00:11:41.883\nand again, over 700 kilometers away\nfrom the nearest volcanic center.\n\n00:11:42.501 --> 00:11:46.867\nHow can a boiling river exist like this?\n\n00:11:47.748 --> 00:11:50.904\nI've asked geothermal experts\nand volcanologists for years,\n\n00:11:50.928 --> 00:11:55.745\nand I'm still unable to find another\nnon-volcanic geothermal system\n\n00:11:55.769 --> 00:11:57.336\nof this magnitude.\n\n00:11:59.079 --> 00:12:00.603\nIt's unique.\n\n00:12:01.447 --> 00:12:04.889\nIt's special on a global scale.\n\n00:12:06.666 --> 00:12:09.134\nSo, still -- how does it work?\n\n00:12:10.418 --> 00:12:12.554\nWhere do we get this heat?\n\n00:12:13.144 --> 00:12:15.237\nThere's still more research to be done\n\n00:12:15.261 --> 00:12:18.450\nto better constrain the problem\nand better understand the system,\n\n00:12:18.474 --> 00:12:20.800\nbut from what the data is telling us now,\n\n00:12:20.824 --> 00:12:24.188\nit looks to be the result\nof a large hydrothermal system.\n\n00:12:25.109 --> 00:12:26.569\nBasically, it works like this:\n\n00:12:26.593 --> 00:12:29.901\nSo, the deeper you go\ninto the earth, the hotter it gets.\n\n00:12:29.925 --> 00:12:32.553\nWe refer to this\nas the geothermal gradient.\n\n00:12:33.418 --> 00:12:38.346\nThe waters could be coming\nfrom as far away as glaciers in the

Yet I'd sit on these silent retreats, sweating through T-shirts in the middle of winter. I'd take naps every chance I got because it was really hard work. Actually, it was exhausting. The instruction was simple enough but I was missing something really important.So why is it so hard to pay attention? Well, studies show that even when we're really trying to pay attention to something \u2014 like maybe this talk \u2014 at some point, about half of us will drift off into a daydream, or have this urge to check our Twitter feed.So what's going on here? It turns out that we're fighting one of the most evolutionarily-conserved learning processes currently known in science, one that's conserved back to the most basic nervous systems known to man.This reward-based learning process is called positive and negative reinforcement, and basically goes like this. We see some food that looks good, our brain says, \"Calories! ... Survival!\" We eat the food, we taste it \u2014 it tastes good. And especially with sugar, our bodies send a signal to our brain that says, \"Remember what you're eating and where you found it.\" We lay down this context-dependent memory and learn to repeat the process next time. See food, eat food, feel good, repeat. Trigger, behavior, reward.Simple, right? Well, after a while, our creative brains say, \"You know what? You can use this for more than just remembering where food is. You know, next time you feel bad, why don't you try eating something good so you'll feel better?\" We thank our brains for the great idea, try this and quickly learn that if we eat chocolate or ice cream when we're mad or sad, we feel better.Same process, just a different trigger. Instead of this hunger signal coming from our stomach, this emotional signal \u2014 feeling sad \u2014 triggers that urge to eat.Maybe in our teenage years, we were a nerd at school, and we see those rebel kids outside smoking and we think, \"Hey, I want to be cool.\" So we start smoking. The Marlboro Man wasn't a dork, and that was no accident. See cool, smoke to be cool, feel good. Repeat. Trigger, behavior, reward. And each time we do this, we learn to repeat the process and it becomes a habit. So later, feeling stressed out triggers that urge to smoke a cigarette or to eat something sweet.Now, with these same brain processes, we've gone from learning to survive to literally killing ourselves with these habits. Obesity and smoking are among the leading preventable causes of morbidity and mortality in the world.So back to my breath. What if instead of fighting our brains, or trying to force ourselves to pay attention, we instead tapped into this natural, reward-based learning process ... but added a twist? What if instead we just got really curious about what was happening in our momentary experience?I'll give you an example. In my lab, we studied whether mindfulness training could help people quit smoking. Now, just like trying to force myself to pay attention to my breath, they could try to force themselves to quit smoking. And the majority of them had tried this before and failed \u2014 on average, six times.Now, with mindfulness training, we dropped the bit about forcing and instead focused on being curious. In fact, we even told them to smoke. What? Yeah, we said, \"Go ahead and smoke, just be really curious about what it's like when you do.\"And what did they notice? Well here's an example from one of our smokers. She said, \"Mindful smoking: smells like stinky cheese and tastes like chemicals, YUCK!\" Now, she knew, cognitively that smoking was bad for her, that's why she joined our program. What she discovered just by being curiously aware when she smoked was that smoking tastes like shit.(Laughter)Now, she moved from knowledge to wisdom. She moved from knowing in her head that smoking was bad for her to knowing it in her bones, and the spell of smoking was broken. She started to become disenchanted with her behavior.Now, the prefrontal cortex, that youngest part of our brain from an evolutionary perspective, it understands on an intellectual level that we shouldn't smoke. And it tries its hardest to help us change our behavior, to help us stop smoking, to help us stop eating that second, that third, that fourth cookie. We call this cognitive control. We're using cognition to control our behavior. Unfortunately, this is also the first part of our brain that goes offline when we get stressed out, which isn't that helpful.Now, we can all relate to this in our own experience. We're much more likely to do things like yell at our spouse or kids when we're stressed out or tired, even though we know it's not going to be helpful. We just can't help ourselves.When the prefrontal cortex goes offline, we fall back into our old habits, which is why this disenchantment is so important. Seeing what we get from our habits helps us understand them at a deeper level \u2014 to know it in our bones so we don't have to force ourselves to hold back or restrain ourselves from behavior. We're just less interested in doing it in the first place.And this is what mindfulness is all about: Seeing really clearly what we get when we get caught up in our behaviors, becoming disenchanted on a visceral level and from this disenchanted stance, naturally letting go.This isn't to say that, poof, magically we quit smoking. But over time, as we learn to see more and more clearly the results of our actions, we let go of old habits and form new ones.The paradox here is that mindfulness is just about being really interested in getting close and personal with what's actually happening in our bodies and minds from moment to moment. This willingness to turn toward our experience rather than trying to make unpleasant cravings go away as quickly as possible. And this willingness to turn toward our experience is supported by curiosity, which is naturally rewarding.What does curiosity feel like? It feels good. And what happens when we get curious? We start to notice that cravings are simply made up of body sensations \u2014 oh, there's tightness, there's tension, there's restlessness \u2014 and that these body sensations come and go. These are bite-size pieces of experiences that we can manage from moment to moment rather than getting clobbered by this huge, scary craving that we choke on.In other words, when we get curious, we step out of our old, fear-based, reactive habit patterns, and we step into being. We become this inner scientist where we're eagerly awaiting that next data point.Now, this might sound too simplistic to affect behavior. But in one study, we found that mindfulness training was twice as good as gold standard therapy at helping people quit smoking. So it actually works.And when we studied the brains of experienced meditators, we found that parts of a neural network of self-referential processing called the default mode network were at play. Now, one current hypothesis is that a region of this network, called the posterior cingulate cortex, is activated not necessarily by craving itself but when we get caught up in it, when we get sucked in, and it takes us for a ride.In contrast, when we let go \u2014 step out of the process just by being curiously aware of what's happening \u2014 this same brain region quiets down.Now we're testing app and online-based mindfulness training programs that target these core mechanisms and, ironically, use the same technology that's driving us to distraction to help us step out of our unhealthy habit patterns of smoking, of stress eating and other addictive behaviors.Now, remember that bit about context-dependent memory? We can deliver these tools to peoples' fingertips in the contexts that matter most. So we can help them tap into their inherent capacity to be curiously aware right when that urge to smoke or stress eat or whatever arises.So if you don't smoke or stress eat, maybe the next time you feel this urge to check your email when you're bored, or you're trying to distract yourself from work, or maybe to compulsively respond to that text message when you're driving, see if you can tap into this natural capacity, just be curiously aware of what's happening in your body and mind in that moment. It will just be another chance to perpetuate one of our endless and exhaustive habit loops ... or step out of it.Instead of see text message, compulsively text back, feel a little bit better \u2014 notice the urge, get curious, feel the joy of letting go and repeat.Thank you.(Applause)", "id": 2420, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:12.718 --> 00:00:14.574\nWhen I was first learning to meditate,\n\n00:00:14.598 --> 00:00:17.654\nthe instruction was to simply\npay attention to my breath,\n\n00:00:17.678 --> 00:00:19.758\nand when my mind wandered,\nto bring it back.\n\n00:00:20.598 --> 00:00:21.958\nSounded simple enough.\n\n00:00:22.638 --> 00:00:25.854\nYet I'd sit on these silent retreats,\n\n00:00:25.878 --> 00:00:29.214\nsweating through T-shirts\nin the middle of winter.\n\n00:00:29.238 --> 00:00:32.574\nI'd take naps every chance I got\nbecause it was really hard work.\n\n00:00:32.598 --> 00:00:34.598\nActually, it was exhausting.\n\n00:00:35.358 --> 00:00:37.094\nThe instruction was simple enough\n\n00:00:37.118 --> 00:00:39.238\nbut I was missing something\nreally important.\n\n00:00:40.278 --> 00:00:42.518\nSo why is it so hard to pay attention?\n\n00:00:43.038 --> 00:00:44.494\nWell, studies show\n\n00:00:44.518 --> 00:00:47.694\nthat even when we're really\ntrying to pay attention to something --\n\n00:00:47.718 --> 00:00:49.294\nlike maybe this talk --\n\n00:00:49.318 --> 00:00:50.534\nat some point,\n\n00:00:50.558 --> 00:00:52.894\nabout half of us\nwill drift off into a daydream,\n\n00:00:52.918 --> 00:00:54.998\nor have this urge\nto check our Twitter feed.\n\n00:00:56.318 --> 00:00:57.838\nSo what's going on here?\n\n00:00:58.958 --> 00:01:02.414\nIt turns out that we're fighting one\nof the most evolutionarily-conserved\n\n00:01:02.438 --> 00:01:05.294\nlearning processes\ncurrently known in science,\n\n00:01:05.318 --> 00:01:06.534\none that's conserved\n\n00:01:06.558 --> 00:01:08.998\nback to the most basic\nnervous systems known to man.\n\n00:01:09.798 --> 00:01:11.454\nThis reward-based learning process\n\n00:01:11.478 --> 00:01:13.654\nis called positive\nand negative reinforcement,\n\n00:01:13.678 --> 00:01:15.238\nand basically goes like this.\n\n00:01:16.158 --> 00:01:17.854\nWe see some food that looks good,\n\n00:01:17.878 --> 00:01:20.574\nour brain says, \"Calories! ...

for her,\n\n00:04:13.038 --> 00:04:14.918\nthat's why she joined our program.\n\n00:04:15.638 --> 00:04:20.174\nWhat she discovered just by being\ncuriously aware when she smoked\n\n00:04:20.198 --> 00:04:23.334\nwas that smoking tastes like shit.\n\n00:04:23.358 --> 00:04:25.038\n(Laughter)\n\n00:04:26.318 --> 00:04:30.333\nNow, she moved from knowledge to wisdom.\n\n00:04:30.357 --> 00:04:33.453\nShe moved from knowing in her head\nthat smoking was bad for her\n\n00:04:33.477 --> 00:04:35.934\nto knowing it in her bones,\n\n00:04:35.958 --> 00:04:38.254\nand the spell of smoking was broken.\n\n00:04:38.278 --> 00:04:41.638\nShe started to become\ndisenchanted with her behavior.\n\n00:04:42.918 --> 00:04:45.014\nNow, the prefrontal cortex,\n\n00:04:45.038 --> 00:04:48.574\nthat youngest part of our brain\nfrom an evolutionary perspective,\n\n00:04:48.598 --> 00:04:52.654\nit understands on an intellectual level\nthat we shouldn't smoke.\n\n00:04:52.678 --> 00:04:56.494\nAnd it tries its hardest\nto help us change our behavior,\n\n00:04:56.518 --> 00:04:57.854\nto help us stop smoking,\n\n00:04:57.878 --> 00:05:01.998\nto help us stop eating that second,\nthat third, that fourth cookie.\n\n00:05:02.918 --> 00:05:04.414\nWe call this cognitive control.\n\n00:05:04.438 --> 00:05:07.238\nWe're using cognition\nto control our behavior.\n\n00:05:07.918 --> 00:05:09.134\nUnfortunately,\n\n00:05:09.158 --> 00:05:11.094\nthis is also the first part of our brain\n\n00:05:11.118 --> 00:05:13.134\nthat goes offline\nwhen we get stressed out,\n\n00:05:13.158 --> 00:05:14.414\nwhich isn't that helpful.\n\n00:05:14.438 --> 00:05:16.915\nNow, we can all relate to this\nin our own experience.\n\n00:05:16.939 --> 00:05:20.094\nWe're much more likely to do things\nlike yell at our spouse or kids\n\n00:05:20.118 --> 00:05:21.734\nwhen we're stressed out or tired,\n\n00:05:21.758 --> 00:05:24.094\neven though we know\nit's not going to be helpful.\n\n00:05:24.118 --> 00:05:25.638\nWe just can't help ourselves.\n\n00:05:27.078 --> 00:05:29.254\nWhen the prefrontal cortex goes offline,\n\n00:05:29.278 --> 00:05:31.494\nwe fall back into our old habits,\n\n00:05:31.518 --> 00:05:34.374\nwhich is why this disenchantment\nis so important.\n\n00:05:34.398 --> 00:05:36.054\nSeeing what we get from our habits\n\n00:05:36.078 --> 00:05:38.254\nhelps us understand them\nat a deeper level --\n\n00:05:38.278 --> 00:05:39.534\nto know it in our bones\n\n00:05:39.558 --> 00:05:41.814\nso we don't have to force\nourselves to hold back\n\n00:05:41.838 --> 00:05:43.574\nor restrain ourselves from behavior.\n\n00:05:43.598 --> 00:05:46.374\nWe're just less interested\nin doing it in the first place.\n\n00:05:46.398 --> 00:05:48.934\nAnd this is what mindfulness is all about:\n\n00:05:48.958 --> 00:05:52.638\nSeeing really clearly what we get\nwhen we get caught up in our behaviors,\n\n00:05:53.518 --> 00:05:57.094\nbecoming disenchanted on a visceral level\n\n00:05:57.118 --> 00:06:00.238\nand from this disenchanted stance,\nnaturally letting go.\n\n00:06:00.878 --> 00:06:04.374\nThis isn't to say that, poof,\nmagically we quit smoking.\n\n00:06:04.398 --> 00:06:07.014\nBut over time, as we learn\nto see more and more clearly\n\n00:06:07.038 --> 00:06:08.374\nthe results of our actions,\n\n00:06:08.398 --> 00:06:11.038\nwe let go of old habits and form new ones.\n\n00:06:12.078 --> 00:06:13.414\nThe paradox here\n\n00:06:13.438 --> 00:06:16.254\nis that mindfulness is just\nabout being really interested\n\n00:06:16.278 --> 00:06:17.694\nin getting close and personal\n\n00:06:17.718 --> 00:06:20.294\nwith what's actually happening\nin our bodies and minds\n\n00:06:20.318 --> 00:06:21.934\nfrom moment to moment.\n\n00:06:21.958 --> 00:06:24.254\nThis willingness\nto turn toward our experience\n\n00:06:24.278 --> 00:06:27.958\nrather than trying to make unpleasant\ncravings go away as quickly as possible.\n\n00:06:28.718 --> 00:06:31.294\nAnd this willingness\nto turn toward our experience\n\n00:06:31.318 --> 00:06:33.174\nis supported by curiosity,\n\n00:06:33.198 --> 00:06:34.934\nwhich is naturally rewarding.\n\n00:06:34.958 --> 00:06:36.694\nWhat does curiosity feel like?\n\n00:06:36.718 --> 00:06:37.918\nIt feels good.\n\n00:06:38.998 --> 00:06:41.304\nAnd what happens when we get curious?\n\n00:06:41.328 --> 00:06:44.774\nWe start to notice that cravings\nare simply made up of body sensations --\n\n00:06:44.798 --> 00:06:47.054\noh, there's tightness, there's tension,\n\n00:06:47.078 --> 00:06:48.734\nthere's restlessness --\n\n00:06:48.758 --> 00:06:51.198\nand that these body\nsensations come and go.\n\n00:06:51.838 --> 00:06:54.814\nThese are bite-size pieces of experiences\n\n00:06:54.838 --> 00:06:56.854\nthat we can manage from moment to moment\n\n00:06:56.878 --> 00:07:01.014\nrather than getting clobbered\nby this huge, scary craving\n\n00:07:01.038 --> 00:07:02.414\nthat we choke on.\n\n00:07:02.438 --> 00:07:04.934\nIn other words, when we get curious,\n\n00:07:04.958 --> 00:07:09.694\nwe step out of our old,\nfear-based, reactive habit patterns,\n\n00:07:09.718 --> 00:07:11.934\nand we step into being.\n\n00:07:11.958 --> 00:07:14.854\nWe become this inner scientist\n\n00:07:14.878 --> 00:07:18.094\nwhere we're eagerly awaiting\nthat next data point.\n\n00:07:18.118 --> 00:07:22.654\nNow, this might sound\ntoo simplistic to affect behavior.\n\n00:07:22.678 --> 00:07:25.134\nBut in one study,\nwe found that mindfulness training\n\n00:07:25.158 --> 00:07:29.054\nwas twice as good as gold standard therapy\nat helping people quit smoking.\n\n00:07:29.078 --> 00:07:30.518\nSo it actually works.\n\n00:07:31.758 --> 00:07:34.574\nAnd when we studied\nthe brains of experienced meditators,\n\n00:07:34.598 --> 00:07:38.414\nwe found that parts of a neural network\nof self-referential processing\n\n00:07:38.438 --> 00:07:40.014\ncalled the default mode network\n\n00:07:40.038 --> 00:07:41.254\nwere at play.\n\n00:07:41.278 --> 00:07:44.214\nNow, one current hypothesis\nis that a region of this network,\n\n00:07:44.238 --> 00:07:46.454\ncalled the posterior cingulate cortex,\n\n00:07:46.478 --> 00:07:49.214\nis activated not necessarily\nby craving itself\n\n00:07:49.238 --> 00:07:51.854\nbut when we get caught up in it,\nwhen we get sucked in,\n\n00:07:51.878 --> 00:07:53.574\nand it takes us for a ride.\n\n00:07:53.598 --> 00:07:55.694\nIn contrast, when we let go --\n\n00:07:55.718 --> 00:07:57.094\nstep out of the process\n\n00:07:57.118 --> 00:07:59.614\njust by being curiously aware\nof what's happening --\n\n00:07:59.638 --> 00:08:01.758\nthis same brain region quiets down.\n\n00:08:03.278 --> 00:08:07.374\nNow we're testing app and online-based\nmindfulness training programs\n\n00:08:07.398 --> 00:08:10.534\nthat target these core mechanisms\n\n00:08:10.558 --> 00:08:15.054\nand, ironically, use the same technology\nthat's driving us to distraction\n\n00:08:15.078 --> 00:08:17.614\nto help us step out\nof our unhealthy habit patterns\n\n00:08:17.638 --> 00:08:21.654\nof smoking, of stress eating\nand other addictive behaviors.\n\n00:08:21.678 --> 00:08:24.254\nNow, remember that bit\nabout context-dependent memory?\n\n00:08:24.278 --> 00:08:27.174\nWe can deliver these tools\nto peoples' fingertips\n\n00:08:27.198 --> 00:08:29.454\nin the contexts that matter most.\n\n00:08:29.478 --> 00:08:30.694\nSo we can help them\n\n00:08:30.718 --> 00:08:33.694\ntap into their inherent capacity\nto be curiously aware\n\n00:08:33.718 --> 00:08:37.638\nright when that urge to smoke\nor stress eat or whatever arises.\n\n00:08:38.598 --> 00:08:40.414\nSo if you don't smoke or stress eat,\n\n00:08:40.438 --> 00:08:44.093\nmaybe the next time you feel this urge\nto check your email when you're bored,\n\n00:08:44.117 --> 00:08:46.357\nor you're trying to distract\nyourself from work,\n\n00:08:46.381 --> 00:08:50.180\nor maybe to compulsively respond\nto that text message when you're driving,\n\n00:08:51.038 --> 00:08:54.894\nsee if you can tap into\nthis natural capacity,\n\n00:08:54.918 --> 00:08:56.174\njust be curiously aware\n\n00:08:56.198 --> 00:08:59.134\nof what's happening in your body\nand mind in that moment.\n\n00:08:59.158 --> 00:09:00.614\nIt will just be another chance\n\n00:09:00.638 --> 00:09:04.294\nto perpetuate one of our endless\nand exhaustive habit loops ...\n\n00:09:04.318 --> 00:09:05.558\nor step out of it.\n\n00:09:06.038 --> 00:09:08.934\nInstead of see text message,\ncompulsively text back,\n\n00:09:08.958 --> 00:09:10.694\nfeel a little bit better --\n\n00:09:10.718 --> 00:09:12.174\nnotice the urge,\n\n00:09:12.198 --> 00:09:13.654\nget curious,\n\n00:09:13.678 --> 00:09:15.614\nfeel the joy of letting go\n\n00:09:15.638 --> 00:09:16.838\nand repeat.\n\n00:09:17.398 --> 00:09:18.614\nThank you.\n\n00:09:18.638 --> 00:09:20.998\n(Applause)"}, {"title": "How we'll fight the next deadly virus", "duration": "577", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/pardis_sabeti_how_we_ll_fight_the_next_deadly_virus", "transcript": "You may never have heard of Kenema, Sierra Leone or Arua, Nigeria. But I know them as two of the most extraordinary places on earth.In hospitals there, there's a community of nurses, physicians and scientists that have been quietly battling one of the deadliest threats to humanity for years: Lassa virus. Lassa virus is a lot like Ebola. It can cause a severe fever and can often be fatal. But these individuals, they risk their lives every day to protect the individuals in their communities, and by doing so, protect us all.But one of the most extraordinary things I learned about them on one of my first visits out there many years ago was that they start each morning \u2014 these challenging, extraordinary days on the front lines \u2014 by singing. They gather together, and they show their joy. They show their spirit. And over the years, from year after year as I've visited them and they've visited me, I get to gather with them and I sing and we write and we love it, because it reminds us that we're not just there to pursue science together; we're bonded through a shared humanity.And that of course, as you can imagine, becomes extremely important, even essential, as things begin to change. And that changed a great deal in March of 2014, when the Ebola outbreak was declared in Guinea. This is the first outbreak in West Africa, near the border of Sierra Leone and Liberia. And it was frightening, frightening for us all. We had actually suspected for some time that Lassa and Ebola were more widespread than thought, and we thought it could one day come to Kenema.And so members of my team immediately went out and joined Dr. Humarr Khan and his team there, and we set up diagnostics to be able to have sensitive molecular tests to pick up Ebola if it came across the border and into Sierra Leone. We'd already set up this kind of capacity for Lassa virus, we knew how to do it, the team is outstanding. We just had to give them the tools and place to survey for Ebola.And unfortunately, that day came. On May 23, 2014, a woman checked into the maternity ward at the hospital, and the team ran those important molecular tests and they identified the first confirmed case of Ebola in Sierra Leone. This was an exceptional work that was done. They were able to diagnose the case immediately, to safely treat the patient and to begin to do contact tracing to follow what was going on. It could've stopped something. But by the time that day came, the outbreak had already been breeding for months. With hundreds of cases, it had already eclipsed all previous outbreaks. And it came into Sierra Leone not as that singular case, but as a tidal wave.We had to work with the international community, with the Ministry of Health, with Kenema, to begin to deal with the cases, as the next week brought 31, then 92, then 147 cases \u2014 all coming to Kenema, one of the only places in Sierra Leone that could deal with this.And we worked around the clock trying to do everything we could, trying to help the individuals, trying to get attention, but we also did one other simple thing. From that specimen that we take from a patient's blood to detect Ebola, we can discard it, obviously. The other thing we can do is, actually, put in a chemical and deactivate it, so just place it into a box and ship it across the ocean, and that's what we did. We sent it to Boston, where my team works. And we also worked around the clock doing shift work, day after day, and we quickly generated 99 genomes of the Ebola virus. This is the blueprint \u2014 the genome of a virus is the blueprint. We all have one. It says everything that makes up us, and it tells us so much information.The results of this kind of work are simple and they're powerful. We could actually take these 99 different viruses, look at them and compare them, and we could see, actually, compared to three genomes that had been previously published from Guinea, we could show that the outbreak emerged in Guinea months before, once into the human population, and from there had been transmitting from human to human. Now, that's incredibly important when you're trying to figure out how to intervene, but the important thing is contact tracing. We also could see that as the virus was moving between humans, it was mutating. And each of those mutations are so important, because the diagnostics, the vaccines, the therapies that we're using, are all based on that genome sequence, fundamentally \u2014 that's what drives it. And so global health experts would need to respond, would have to develop, to recalibrate everything that they were doing.But the way that science works, the position I was in at that point is, I had the data, and I could have worked in a silo for many, many months, analyzed the data carefully, slowly, submitted the paper for publication, gone through a few back-and-forths, and then finally when the paper came out, might release that data. That's the way the status quo works.Well, that was not going to work at this point, right? We had friends on the front lines and to us it was just obvious that what we needed is help, lots of help. So the first thing we did is, as soon as the sequences came off the machines, we published it to the web. We just released it to the whole world and said, \"Help us.\" And help came.Before we knew it, we were being contacted from people all over, surprised to see the data out there and released. Some of the greatest viral trackers in the world were suddenly part of our community. We were working together in this virtual way, sharing, regular calls, communications, trying to follow the virus minute by minute, to see ways that we could stop it.And there are so many ways that we can form communities like that. Everybody, particularly when the outbreak started to expand globally, was reaching out to learn, to participate, to engage. Everybody wants to play a part. The amount of human capacity out there is just amazing, and the Internet connects us all. And could you imagine that instead of being frightened of each other, that we all just said, \"Let's do this. Let's work together, and let's make this happen.\"But the problem is that the data that all of us are using, Googling on the web, is just too limited to do what we need to do. And so many opportunities get missed when that happens. So in the early part of the epidemic from Kenema, we'd had 106 clinical records from patients, and we once again made that publicly available to the world. And in our own lab, we could show that you could take those 106 records, we could train computers to predict the prognosis for Ebola patients to near 100 percent accuracy. And we made an app that could release that, to make that available to health-care workers in the field.But 106 is just not enough to make it powerful, to validate it. So we were waiting for more data to release that. and the data has still not come. We are still waiting, tweaking away, in silos rather than working together. And this just \u2014 we can't accept that. Right? You, all of you, cannot accept that. It's our lives on the line. And in fact, actually, many lives were lost, many health-care workers, including beloved colleagues of mine, five colleagues: Mbalu Fonnie, Alex Moigboi, Dr. Humarr Khan, Alice Kovoma and Mohamed Fullah. These are just five of many health-care workers at Kenema and beyond that died while the world waited and while we all worked, quietly and separately.See, Ebola, like all threats to humanity, it's fueled by mistrust and distraction and division. When we build barriers amongst ourselves and we fight amongst ourselves, the virus thrives. But unlike all threats to humanity, Ebola is one where we're actually all the same. We're all in this fight together. Ebola on one person's doorstep could soon be on ours. And so in this place with the same vulnerabilities, the same strengths, the same fears, the same hopes, I hope that we work together with joy.A graduate student of mine was reading a book about Sierra Leone, and she discovered that the word \"Kenema,\" the hospital that we work at and the city where we work in Sierra Leone, is named after the Mende word for \"clear like a river, translucent and open to the public gaze.\" That was really profound for us, because without knowing it, we'd always felt that in order to honor the individuals in Kenema where we worked, we had to work openly, we had to share and we had to work together. And we have to do that. We all have to demand that of ourselves and others \u2014 to be open to each other when an outbreak happens, to fight in this fight together. Because this is not the first outbreak of Ebola, it will not be the last, and there are many other microbes out there that are lying in wait, like Lassa virus and others. And the next time this happens, it could happen in a city of millions, it could start there. It could be something that's transmitted through the air. It could even be disseminated intentionally. And I know that that is frightening, I understand that, but I know also, and this experience shows us, that we have the technology and we have the capacity to win this thing, to win this and have the upper hand over viruses. But we can only do it if we do it together and we do it with joy.So for Dr. Khan and for all of those who sacrificed their lives on the front lines in this fight with us always, let us be in this fight with them always. And let us not let the world be defined by the destruction wrought by one virus, but illuminated by billions of hearts and minds working in unity.Thank you.(Applause)", "id": 2425, "subtitle":

00:01:05.028\nThey gather together,\nand they show their joy.\n\n00:01:05.052 --> 00:01:06.574\nThey show their spirit.\n\n00:01:06.598 --> 00:01:07.757\nAnd over the years,\n\n00:01:07.781 --> 00:01:10.894\nfrom year after year as I've visited them\nand they've visited me,\n\n00:01:10.918 --> 00:01:12.911\nI get to gather with them and I sing\n\n00:01:12.935 --> 00:01:15.109\nand we write and we love it,\n\n00:01:15.133 --> 00:01:18.676\nbecause it reminds us that we're not\njust there to pursue science together;\n\n00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:21.017\nwe're bonded through a shared humanity.\n\n00:01:21.544 --> 00:01:25.867\nAnd that of course, as you can imagine,\nbecomes extremely important,\n\n00:01:25.891 --> 00:01:28.664\neven essential, as things begin to change.\n\n00:01:28.688 --> 00:01:33.477\nAnd that changed a great deal\nin March of 2014,\n\n00:01:33.501 --> 00:01:35.847\nwhen the Ebola outbreak\nwas declared in Guinea.\n\n00:01:36.384 --> 00:01:38.516\nThis is the first outbreak in West Africa,\n\n00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:40.982\nnear the border\nof Sierra Leone and Liberia.\n\n00:01:42.032 --> 00:01:44.554\nAnd it was frightening,\nfrightening for us all.\n\n00:01:44.578 --> 00:01:46.490\nWe had actually suspected for some time\n\n00:01:46.514 --> 00:01:49.156\nthat Lassa and Ebola were more\nwidespread than thought,\n\n00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:51.489\nand we thought it could\none day come to Kenema.\n\n00:01:51.854 --> 00:01:54.264\nAnd so members of my team\nimmediately went out\n\n00:01:54.288 --> 00:01:56.685\nand joined Dr. Humarr Khan\nand his team there,\n\n00:01:56.709 --> 00:02:00.386\nand we set up diagnostics to be able\nto have sensitive molecular tests\n\n00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:02.563\nto pick up Ebola if it came\nacross the border\n\n00:02:02.587 --> 00:02:03.850\nand into Sierra Leone.\n\n00:02:03.874 --> 00:02:06.870\nWe'd already set up this kind\nof capacity for Lassa virus,\n\n00:02:06.894 --> 00:02:08.051\nwe knew how to do it,\n\n00:02:08.075 --> 00:02:09.505\nthe team is outstanding.\n\n00:02:09.529 --> 00:02:12.766\nWe just had to give them\nthe tools and place to survey for Ebola.\n\n00:02:13.298 --> 00:02:14.926\nAnd unfortunately, that day came.\n\n00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:19.931\nOn May 23, 2014, a woman checked\ninto the maternity ward at the hospital,\n\n00:02:19.955 --> 00:02:23.681\nand the team ran\nthose important molecular tests\n\n00:02:23.705 --> 00:02:27.540\nand they identified the first\nconfirmed case of Ebola in Sierra Leone.\n\n00:02:28.065 --> 00:02:30.114\nThis was an exceptional\nwork that was done.\n\n00:02:30.138 --> 00:02:32.398\nThey were able to diagnose\nthe case immediately,\n\n00:02:32.422 --> 00:02:34.735\nto safely treat the patient\n\n00:02:34.759 --> 00:02:37.777\nand to begin to do contact tracing\nto follow what was going on.\n\n00:02:37.801 --> 00:02:39.773\nIt could've stopped something.\n\n00:02:39.797 --> 00:02:42.644\nBut by the time that day came,\n\n00:02:42.668 --> 00:02:45.026\nthe outbreak had already\nbeen breeding for months.\n\n00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:48.690\nWith hundreds of cases, it had already\neclipsed all previous outbreaks.\n\n00:02:48.714 --> 00:02:52.358\nAnd it came into Sierra Leone\nnot as that singular case,\n\n00:02:52.382 --> 00:02:53.674\nbut as a tidal wave.\n\n00:02:54.078 --> 00:02:56.353\nWe had to work\nwith the international community,\n\n00:02:56.377 --> 00:03:00.083\nwith the Ministry of Health, with Kenema,\nto begin to deal with the cases,\n\n00:03:00.107 --> 00:03:02.178\nas the next week brought 31,\n\n00:03:02.202 --> 00:03:05.876\nthen 92, then 147 cases --\nall coming to Kenema,\n\n00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:09.201\none of the only places in Sierra Leone\nthat could deal with this.\n\n00:03:09.568 --> 00:03:12.967\nAnd we worked around the clock\ntrying to do everything we could,\n\n00:03:12.991 --> 00:03:15.952\ntrying to help the individuals,\ntrying to get attention,\n\n00:03:15.976 --> 00:03:17.923\nbut we also did one other simple thing.\n\n00:03:18.502 --> 00:03:22.291\nFrom that specimen that we take\nfrom a patient's blood to detect Ebola,\n\n00:03:22.315 --> 00:03:24.370\nwe can discard it, obviously.\n\n00:03:24.394 --> 00:03:28.010\nThe other thing we can do is, actually,\nput in a chemical and deactivate it,\n\n00:03:28.034 --> 00:03:30.764\nso just place it into a box\nand ship it across the ocean,\n\n00:03:30.788 --> 00:03:31.939\nand that's what we did.\n\n00:03:31.963 --> 00:03:34.059\nWe sent it to Boston, where my team works.\n\n00:03:34.682 --> 00:03:38.519\nAnd we also worked around the clock\ndoing shift work, day after day,\n\n00:03:38.543 --> 00:03:42.412\nand we quickly generated 99 genomes\nof the Ebola virus.\n\n00:03:42.436 --> 00:03:45.493\nThis is the blueprint -- the genome\nof a virus is the blueprint.\n\n00:03:45.517 --> 00:03:46.676\nWe all have one.\n\n00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:48.645\nIt says everything that makes up us,\n\n00:03:48.669 --> 00:03:50.578\nand it tells us so much information.\n\n00:03:50.602 --> 00:03:53.779\nThe results of this kind of work\nare simple and they're powerful.\n\n00:03:54.354 --> 00:03:56.824\nWe could actually take\nthese 99 different viruses,\n\n00:03:56.848 --> 00:03:58.295\nlook at them and compare them,\n\n00:03:58.319 --> 00:04:01.165\nand we could see, actually,\ncompared to three genomes\n\n00:04:01.189 --> 00:04:04.025\nthat had been previously\npublished from Guinea,\n\n00:04:04.049 --> 00:04:07.760\nwe could show that the outbreak\nemerged in Guinea months before,\n\n00:04:07.784 --> 00:04:09.626\nonce into the human population,\n\n00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:12.322\nand from there had been transmitting\nfrom human to human.\n\n00:04:12.346 --> 00:04:13.890\nNow, that's incredibly important\n\n00:04:13.914 --> 00:04:16.282\nwhen you're trying to figure out\nhow to intervene,\n\n00:04:16.306 --> 00:04:18.372\nbut the important thing\nis contact tracing.\n\n00:04:18.396 --> 00:04:21.798\nWe also could see that as the virus\nwas moving between humans,\n\n00:04:21.822 --> 00:04:23.079\nit was mutating.\n\n00:04:23.103 --> 00:04:25.254\nAnd each of those mutations\nare so important,\n\n00:04:25.278 --> 00:04:27.598\nbecause the diagnostics, the vaccines,\n\n00:04:27.622 --> 00:04:29.107\nthe therapies that we're using,\n\n00:04:29.131 --> 00:04:32.489\nare all based on that genome\nsequence, fundamentally --\n\n00:04:32.513 --> 00:04:33.734\nthat's what drives it.\n\n00:04:33.758 --> 00:04:36.640\nAnd so global health experts\nwould need to respond,\n\n00:04:36.664 --> 00:04:37.861\nwould have to develop,\n\n00:04:37.885 --> 00:04:40.438\nto recalibrate everything\nthat they were doing.\n\n00:04:41.037 --> 00:04:44.218\nBut the way that science works,\nthe position I was in at that point\n\n00:04:44.242 --> 00:04:45.393\nis, I had the data,\n\n00:04:45.417 --> 00:04:48.053\nand I could have worked\nin a silo for many, many months,\n\n00:04:48.077 --> 00:04:50.276\nanalyzed the data carefully, slowly,\n\n00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:53.760\nsubmitted the paper for publication,\ngone through a few back-and-forths,\n\n00:04:53.784 --> 00:04:56.913\nand then finally when the paper came out,\nmight release that data.\n\n00:04:56.937 --> 00:04:59.141\nThat's the way the status quo works.\n\n00:04:59.165 --> 00:05:01.736\nWell, that was not going to work\nat this point, right?\n\n00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:03.368\nWe had friends on the front lines\n\n00:05:03.392 --> 00:05:06.646\nand to us it was just obvious\nthat what we needed is help,\n\n00:05:06.670 --> 00:05:07.826\nlots of help.\n\n00:05:07.850 --> 00:05:09.247\nSo the first thing we did is,\n\n00:05:09.271 --> 00:05:11.956\nas soon as the sequences\ncame off the machines,\n\n00:05:11.980 --> 00:05:13.409\nwe published it to the web.\n\n00:05:13.433 --> 00:05:16.269\nWe just released it to the whole world\nand said, \"Help us.\"\n\n00:05:16.293 --> 00:05:17.628\nAnd help came.\n\n00:05:17.652 --> 00:05:18.814\nBefore we knew it,\n\n00:05:18.838 --> 00:05:21.174\nwe were being contacted\nfrom people all over,\n\n00:05:21.198 --> 00:05:23.642\nsurprised to see the data\nout there and released.\n\n00:05:23.666 --> 00:05:25.918\nSome of the greatest\nviral trackers in the world\n\n00:05:25.942 --> 00:05:28.021\nwere suddenly part of our community.\n\n00:05:28.045 --> 00:05:30.375\nWe were working together\nin this virtual way,\n\n00:05:30.399 --> 00:05:33.380\nsharing, regular calls, communications,\n\n00:05:33.404 --> 00:05:36.155\ntrying to follow the virus\nminute by minute,\n\n00:05:36.179 --> 00:05:38.400\nto see ways that we could stop it.\n\n00:05:38.985 --> 00:05:42.743\nAnd there are so many ways\nthat we can form communities like that.\n\n00:05:43.140 --> 00:05:47.465\nEverybody, particularly when the outbreak\nstarted to expand globally,\n\n00:05:47.489 --> 00:05:51.079\nwas reaching out to learn,\nto participate, to engage.\n\n00:05:51.746 --> 00:05:53.340\nEverybody wants to play a part.\n\n00:05:53.364 --> 00:05:56.144\nThe amount of human capacity\nout there is just amazing,\n\n00:05:56.168 --> 00:05:57.891\nand the Internet connects us all.\n\n00:05:57.915 --> 00:06:01.166\nAnd could you imagine that instead\nof being frightened of each other,\n\n00:06:01.190 --> 00:06:03.047\nthat we all just said, \"Let's do this.\n\n00:06:03.071 --> 00:06:05.594\nLet's work together,\nand let's make this happen.\"\n\n00:06:05.618 --> 00:06:08.360\nBut the problem is that the data\nthat all of us are using,\n\n00:06:08.384 --> 00:06:12.421\nGoogling on the web, is just too limited\nto do what we need to do.\n\n00:06:12.445 --> 00:06:15.096\nAnd so many opportunities\nget missed when that happens.\n\n00:06:15.120 --> 00:06:17.601\nSo in the early part\nof the epidemic from Kenema,\n\n00:06:17.625 --> 00:06:20.367\nwe'd had 106 clinical records\nfrom patients,\n\n00:06:20.391 --> 00:06:23.225\nand we once again made that\npublicly available to the world.\n\n00:06:23.249 --> 00:06:26.919\nAnd in our own lab, we could show\nthat you could take those 106 records,\n\n00:06:26.943 --> 00:06:30.561\nwe could train computers to predict\nthe prognosis for Ebola patients\n\n00:06:30.585 --> 00:06:32.362\nto near 100 percent accuracy.\n\n00:06:32.386 --> 00:06:34.483\nAnd we made an app\nthat could release that,\n\n00:06:34.507 --> 00:06:37.277\nto make that available\nto health-care workers in the field.\n\n00:06:37.301 --> 00:06:40.560\nBut 106 is just not enough\nto make it powerful,\n\n00:06:40.584 --> 00:06:41.735\nto validate it.\n\n00:06:41.759 --> 00:06:44.413\nSo we were waiting for more data\nto release that.\n\n00:06:44.437 --> 00:06:46.481\nand the data has

My name is Matthew Williams, and I am a champion. I have won medals in three different sports and national games in Canada, competed at the international level in basketball and was proud to represent Canada on the world stage.(Applause)I train five days a week for basketball and speed skating, work with top quality coaches and mental performance consultants to be at my best in my sport. By the way, all that is through Special Olympics. Does that change the way you think of me and my accomplishments?The world does not see all people like me as champions. Not long ago, people like me were shunned and hidden away. There has been lots of change since Special Olympics began in 1968, but in too many cases, people with intellectual disabilities are invisible to the wider population. People use the r-word in front of me, and they think it doesn't matter. That's the word \"retard\" or \"retarded\" used in a derogatory manner. They're not thinking about how much it hurts me and my friends.I don't want you to think I'm here because I'm a charity case. I am here because there is still a big problem with the way many people see individuals with intellectual disabilities, or, too often, how they don't see them at all.Did you know the World Games happened this year? I was one of over 6,500 athletes with intellectual disabilities from 165 countries who competed in LA. There was over 62,000 spectators watching opening ceremonies, and there was live coverage on TSN and ESPN. Did you even know that happened?What do you think of when you see someone like me? I am here today to challenge you to look at us as equals.Special Olympics transforms the self-identity of athletes with intellectual disabilities and the perceptions of everyone watching. For those of you who aren't familiar, Special Olympics is for athletes with intellectual disabilities. Special Olympics is separate from the Paralympics and Olympics. We offer high-quality, year round sports programs for people with intellectual disabilities that changes lives and perceptions. This movement has changed my life and those of so many others. And it has changed the way the world sees people with intellectual disabilities.I was born with epilepsy and an intellectual disability. Growing up, I played hockey until I was 12 years old. The older I got, the more I felt it was harder to keep up with everyone else, and I was angry and frustrated. For a while, I did not play any sports, didn't have many friends and felt left out and sad.There was a time when people with intellectual disabilities were hidden away from society. No one thought they could participate in sports, let alone be a valued member of society. In the 1960s, Dr. Frank Hayden, a scientist at the University of Toronto, was studying the effects of regular exercise on the fitness levels of children with intellectual disabilities. Using rigorous scientific research, Dr. Hayden and other researchers came to the conclusion that it was simply the lack of opportunity to participate that caused their fitness levels to suffer.Lots of people doubted that people with intellectual disabilities could benefit from fitness programs and sports competition opportunities. But pioneers like Dr. Hayden and Eunice Kennedy Shriver, the founder of Special Olympics, persevered, and Special Olympics athletes have proved them right four and a half million times over.(Applause)Before I joined Special Olympics, I was nervous because I was young, shy, not confident and didn't have many friends. When I got there, though, everyone was very encouraging, supportive, and let me be myself without being judged. Now, I am a basketball player and speed skater who has competed at provincial, national games, and this year made it all the way to the World Summer Games in LA, where I was part of the first ever Canadian basketball team to compete at World Games.(Applause)I am one of more than four and a half million athletes around the globe, and I've heard so many similar stories. Being Special Olympics athletes restores our pride and dignity.Special Olympics also addresses critical health needs. Studies have shown that, on average, men with intellectual disabilities die 13 years younger than men without, and women with intellectual disabilities die 20 years younger than women without. Special Olympics keeps us healthy by getting us active and participating in sport. Also, our coaches teach us about nutrition and health. Special Olympics also provides free health screening for athletes who have difficulty communicating with their doctor or accessing health care.At the 2015 World Summer Games, my Team Canada teammates and I played the Nigerian basketball team. The day before our game, the Nigerian basketball team went to the World Games Healthy Athlete screening, where seven of 10 members were given hearing aids for free and got to hear clearly for the first time.(Applause)The change in them was amazing. They were more excited, happy and confident, because their coach could vocally communicate with them. And they were emotional because they could hear the sounds of the basketball, the sounds of the whistle and the cheering fans in the stands \u2014 sounds that we take for granted. Special Olympics is transforming more than just the athlete in their sport. Special Olympics is transforming their lives off the field. This year, research findings showed that nearly half of the adults in the US don't know a single person with an intellectual disability, and the 44 percent of Americans who don't have personal contact with intellectual disabilities are significantly less accepting and positive.Then there's the r-word, proving that people with intellectual disabilities are still invisible to far too many people. People use it as a casual term or an insult. It was tweeted more than nine million times last year, and it is deeply hurtful to me and my four and a half million fellow athletes around the planet. People don't think it's insulting, but it is. As my fellow athlete and global messenger John Franklin Stephens wrote in an open letter to a political pundit who used the r-word as an insult, \"Come join us someday at Special Olympics. See if you walk away with your heart unchanged.\"(Applause)This year, at the 2015 World Summer Games, people lined up for hours to get into the final night of powerlifting competition. So it was standing room only when my teammate Jackie Barrett, the Newfoundland Moose, deadlifted 655 pounds and lifted 611 pounds in the squat \u2014(Applause)setting huge new records for Special Olympics. Jackie is a record holder among all powerlifters in Newfoundland \u2014 not just Special Olympics, all powerlifters. Jackie was a huge star in LA, and ESPN live-tweeted his record-breaking lifts and were wowed by his performance.Fifty years ago, few imagined individuals with intellectual disabilities could do anything like that. This year, 60,000 spectators filled the famous LA Memorial Coliseum to watch the opening ceremonies of World Games and cheer athletes from 165 countries around the world. Far from being hidden away, we were cheered and celebrated. Special Olympics teaches athletes to be confident and proud of themselves. Special Olympics teaches the world that people with intellectual disabilities deserve respect and inclusion.(Applause)Now, I have dreams and achievements in my sport, great coaches, respect and dignity, better health, and I am pursuing a career as a personal trainer.(Applause)I am no longer hidden, bullied and I am here doing a TED Talk.(Applause)The world is a different place because of Special Olympics, but there is still farther to go. So the next time you see someone with an intellectual disability, I hope you will see their ability. The next time someone uses the r-word near you, I hope you will tell them how much it hurts. I hope you will think about getting involved with Special Olympics.(Applause)I would like to leave you with one final thought. Nelson Mandela said, \"Sports has the power to change the world.\" Special Olympics is changing the world by transforming four and a half million athletes and giving us a place to be confident, meet friends, not be judged and get to feel like and be champions.Thank you very much.(Applause)", "id": 2426, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:13.358 -->

00:07:41.454\nthe Nigerian basketball team went to\nthe World Games Healthy Athlete screening,\n\n00:07:41.478 --> 00:07:43.814\nwhere seven of 10 members\n\n00:07:43.838 --> 00:07:46.334\nwere given

Let's fix it", "duration": "844", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/dambisa_moyo_economic_growth_has_stalled_let_s_fix_it", "transcript": "Our ability to create and sustain economic growth is the defining challenge of our time.Of course there are other challenges \u2014 health care, disease burdens and pandemics, environmental challenges and, of course, radicalized terrorism. However, to the extent that we can actually solve the economic growth challenge, it will take us a long way to solving the challenges that I've just elucidated.More importantly, unless and until we solve economic growth and create sustainable, long-term economic growth, we'll be unable to address the seemingly intractable challenges that continue to pervade the globe today, whether it's health care, education or economic development.The fundamental question is this: How are we going to create economic growth in advanced and developed economies like the United States and across Europe at a time when they continue to struggle to create economic growth after the financial crisis?They continue to underperform and to see an erosion in the three key drivers of economic growth: capital, labor and productivity. In particular, these developed economies continue to see debts and deficits, the decline and erosion of both the quality and quantity of labor and they also see productivity stalling.In a similar vein, how are we going to create economic growth in the emerging markets, where 90 percent of the world's population lives and where, on average, 70 percent of the population is under the age of 25? In these countries, it is essential that they grow at a minimum of seven percent a year in order to put a dent in poverty and to double per capita incomes in one generation. And yet today, the largest emerging economies \u2014 countries with at least 50 million people \u2014 continue to struggle to reach that seven percent magic mark. Worse than that, countries like India, Russia, South Africa, Brazil and even China are falling below that seven percent number and, in many cases, actually regressing.Economic growth matters. With economic growth, countries and societies enter into a virtuous cycle of upward mobility, opportunity and improved living standards. Without growth, countries contract and atrophy, not just in the annals of economic statistics but also in the meaning of life and how lives are lived. Economic growth matters powerfully for the individual. If growth wanes, the risk to human progress and the risk of political and social instability rises, and societies become dimmer, coarser and smaller.The context matters. And countries in emerging markets do not need to grow at the same rates as developed countries.Now, I know some of you in this room find this to be a risky proposition. There are some people here who will turn around and be quite disillusioned by what's happened around the world and basically ascribe that to economic growth. You worry about the overpopulation of the planet. And looking at the UN's recent statistics and projections that the world will have 11 billion people on the planet before it plateaus in 2100, you're concerned about what that does to natural resources \u2014 arable land, potable water, energy and minerals. You are also concerned about the degradation of the environment. And you worry about how man, embodied in the corporate globalist, has become greedy and corrupt.But I'm here to tell you today that economic growth has been the backbone of changes in living standards of millions of people around the world. And more importantly, it's not just economic growth that has been driven by capitalism.The definition of capitalism, very simply put, is that the factors of production, such as trade and industry, capital and labor, are left in the hands of the private sector and not the state.It's really essential here that we understand that fundamentally the critique is not for economic growth per se but what has happened to capitalism. And to the extent that we need to create economic growth over the long term, we're going to have to pursue it with a better form of economic stance.Economic growth needs capitalism, but it needs it to work properly. And as I mentioned a moment ago, the core of the capitalist system has been defined by private actors. And even this, however, is a very simplistic dichotomy. Capitalism: good; non-capitalism: bad. When in practical experience, capitalism is much more of a spectrum. And we have countries such as China, which have practiced more state capitalism, and we have countries like the Unites States which are more market capitalist.Our efforts to critique the capitalist system, however, have tended to focus on countries like China that are in fact not blatantly market capitalism.However, there is a real reason and real concern for us to now focus our attentions on purer forms of capitalism, particularly those embodied by the United States. This is really important because this type of capitalism has increasingly been afforded the critique that it is now fostering corruption and, worse still, it's increasing income inequality \u2014 the idea that the few are benefiting at the expense of the many.The two really critical questions that we need to address is how can we fix capitalism so that it can help create economic growth but at the same time can help to address social ills.In order to think about that framing, we have to ask ourselves, how does capitalism work today? Very simplistically, capitalism is set on the basis of an individual utility maximizer \u2014 a selfish individual who goes after what he or she wants. And only after they've maximized their utility do they then decide it's important to provide support to other social contracts. Of course, in this system governments do tax, and they use part of their revenues to fund social programs, recognizing that government's role is not just regulation but also to be arbiter of social goods. But nevertheless, this framework \u2014 this two-stage framework \u2014 is the basis from which we must now start to think about how we can improve the capitalist model.I would argue that there are two sides to this challenge. First of all, we can draw on the right-wing policies to see what could be beneficial for us to think about how we can improve capitalism.In particular, right-leaning policies have tended to focus on things like conditional transfers, where we pay and reward people for doing the things that we actually think can help enhance economic growth. For example, sending children to school, parents could earn money for that, or getting their children inoculated or immunized, parents could get paid for doing that.Now, quite apart from the debate on whether or not we should be paying people to do what we think they should do anyway, the fact of the matter is that pay for performance has actually yielded some positive results in places like Mexico, in Brazil and also in pilot programs in New York.But there are also benefits and significant changes underway on left-leaning policies. Arguments that government should expand its role and responsibility so that it's not so narrowly defined and that government should be much more of an arbiter of the factors of production have become commonplace with the success of China. But also we've started to have debates about how the role of the private sector should move away from just being a profit motive and really be more engaged in the delivery of social programs. Things like the corporate social responsibility programs, albeit small in scale, are moving in that right direction. Of course, left-leaning policies have also tended to blur the lines between government, NGOs and private sector.Two very good examples of this are the 19th-century United States, when the infrastructure rollout was really about public-private partnerships. More recently, of course, the advent of the Internet has also proven to the world that public and private can work together for the betterment of society.My fundamental message to you is this: We cannot continue to try and solve the world economic growth challenges by being dogmatic and being unnecessarily ideological. In order to create sustainable, long-term economic growth and solve the challenges and social ills that continue to plague the world today, we're going to have to be more broad-minded about what might work.Ultimately, we have to recognize that ideology is the enemy of growth.Thank you.(Applause)Bruno Giussani: I want to ask a couple of questions, Dambisa, because one could react to your last sentence by saying growth is also an ideology, it's possibly the dominant ideology of our times. What do you say to those who react that way?DM: Well, I think that that's completely legitimate, and I think that we're already having that discussion. There's a lot of work going on around happiness and other metrics being used for measuring people's success and improvements in living standards. And so I think that we should be open to what could deliver improvements in people's living standards and continue to reduce poverty around the world.BG: So you're basically pleading for rehabilitating growth, but the only way for that happen without compromising the capacity of the earth, to take us on a long journey, is for economic growth somehow to decouple from the underlying use of resources. Do you see that happening?DM: Well, I think that I'm more optimistic about human ability and ingenuity. I think if we start to constrain ourselves using the finite, scarce and depleting resources that we know today, we could get quite negative and quite concerned about the way the world is.However, we've seen the Club of Rome, we've seen previous claims that the world would be running out of resources, and it's not to argue that those things are not valid. But I think, with ingenuity we could see desalination, I think we could reinvest in energy, so that we can actually get better outcomes. And so in that sense, I'm much more optimistic about what humans can do.BG: The thing that strikes me about your proposals for rehabilitating growth and taking a different direction is that you're kind of suggesting to fix capitalism with more capitalism \u2014 with putting a price tag on good behavior as incentive or developing a bigger role for business in social issues. Is that what you're suggesting?DM: I'm suggesting we have to be open-minded. I think it is absolutely the case that traditional models of economic growth are not working the way we would like them to. And I think it's no accident that today the largest economy in the world, the United States, has democracy, liberal democracy, as it's core political stance and it has free market capitalism \u2014 to the extent that it is free \u2014 free market capitalism as its economic stance. The second largest economy is China. It has deprioritized democracy and it has state capitalism, which is a completely different model. These two countries, completely different political models and completely different economic models, and yet they have the same income inequality number measured as a Gini coefficient.I think those are the debates we should have, because it's not clear at all what model we should be adopting, and I think there needs to be much more discourse and much more humility about what we know and what we don't know.BG: One last question. The COP21 is going on in Paris. If you could send a tweet to all the heads of state and heads of delegations there, what would you say?DM: Again, I would be very much about being open-minded. As you're aware, the issues around the environmental concerns have been on the agenda many times now \u2014 in Copenhagen, '72 in Stockholm \u2014 and we keep revisiting these issues partly because there is not a fundamental agreement, in fact there's a schism between what the developed countries believe and want and what emerging market countries want. Emerging market countries need to continue to create economic growth so that we don't have political uncertainty in the those countries. Developed countries recognize that they have a real, important responsibility not only just to manage their CO2 emissions and some of the degradation that they're contributing to the world, but also as trendsetters in R&D. And so they have to come to the table as well. But in essence, it cannot be a situation where we start ascribing policies to the emerging markets without developed countries themselves also taking quite a swipe at what they're doing both in demand and supply in developed markets.BG: Dambisa, thank you for coming to TED.

00:00:33.974\nHowever,\n\n00:00:33.998 --> 00:00:38.574\nto the extent that we can actually\nsolve the economic growth challenge,\n\n00:00:38.598 --> 00:00:39.934\nit will take us a long way\n\n00:00:39.958 --> 00:00:42.558\nto solving the challenges\nthat I've just elucidated.\n\n00:00:43.358 --> 00:00:45.014\nMore importantly,\n\n00:00:45.038 --> 00:00:49.534\nunless and until we solve economic growth\n\n00:00:49.558 --> 00:00:53.574\nand create sustainable,\nlong-term economic growth,\n\n00:00:53.598 --> 00:00:56.014\nwe'll be unable to address\n\n00:00:56.038 --> 00:01:01.374\nthe seemingly intractable challenges\nthat continue to pervade the globe today,\n\n00:01:01.398 --> 00:01:05.798\nwhether it's health care,\neducation or economic development.\n\n00:01:06.638 --> 00:01:08.838\nThe fundamental question is this:\n\n00:01:09.478 --> 00:01:12.094\nHow are we going to create economic growth\n\n00:01:12.118 --> 00:01:16.694\nin advanced and developed economies\nlike the United States and across Europe\n\n00:01:16.718 --> 00:01:18.774\nat a time when they continue to struggle\n\n00:01:18.798 --> 00:01:21.598\nto create economic growth\nafter the financial crisis?\n\n00:01:22.438 --> 00:01:25.214\nThey continue to underperform\n\n00:01:25.238 --> 00:01:29.358\nand to see an erosion in the three\nkey drivers of economic growth:\n\n00:01:29.998 --> 00:01:33.318\ncapital, labor and productivity.\n\n00:01:34.078 --> 00:01:35.534\nIn particular,\n\n00:01:35.558 --> 00:01:40.494\nthese developed economies\ncontinue to see debts and deficits,\n\n00:01:40.518 --> 00:01:45.374\nthe decline and erosion\nof both the quality and quantity of labor\n\n00:01:45.398 --> 00:01:47.678\nand they also see productivity stalling.\n\n00:01:48.558 --> 00:01:50.254\nIn a similar vein,\n\n00:01:50.278 --> 00:01:53.694\nhow are we going to create\neconomic growth in the emerging markets,\n\n00:01:53.718 --> 00:01:56.974\nwhere 90 percent\nof the world's population lives\n\n00:01:56.998 --> 00:01:58.534\nand where, on average,\n\n00:01:58.558 --> 00:02:02.078\n70 percent of the population\nis under the age of 25?\n\n00:02:02.598 --> 00:02:04.054\nIn these countries,\n\n00:02:04.078 --> 00:02:08.254\nit is essential that they grow\nat a minimum of seven percent a year\n\n00:02:08.278 --> 00:02:10.374\nin order to put a dent in poverty\n\n00:02:10.398 --> 00:02:13.598\nand to double per capita incomes\nin one generation.\n\n00:02:14.478 --> 00:02:16.534\nAnd yet today,\n\n00:02:16.558 --> 00:02:18.654\nthe largest emerging economies --\n\n00:02:18.678 --> 00:02:21.374\ncountries with at least\n50 million people --\n\n00:02:21.398 --> 00:02:24.878\ncontinue to struggle to reach\nthat seven percent magic mark.\n\n00:02:25.718 --> 00:02:26.934\nWorse than that,\n\n00:02:26.958 --> 00:02:31.574\ncountries like India, Russia,\nSouth Africa, Brazil and even China\n\n00:02:31.598 --> 00:02:34.094\nare falling below\nthat seven percent number\n\n00:02:34.118 --> 00:02:36.958\nand, in many cases, actually regressing.\n\n00:02:37.758 --> 00:02:39.678\nEconomic growth matters.\n\n00:02:40.398 --> 00:02:41.854\nWith economic growth,\n\n00:02:41.878 --> 00:02:46.054\ncountries and societies\nenter into a virtuous cycle\n\n00:02:46.078 --> 00:02:50.678\nof upward mobility, opportunity\nand improved living standards.\n\n00:02:51.198 --> 00:02:55.014\nWithout growth,\ncountries contract and atrophy,\n\n00:02:55.038 --> 00:02:58.254\nnot just in the annals\nof economic statistics\n\n00:02:58.278 --> 00:03:01.798\nbut also in the meaning of life\nand how lives are lived.\n\n00:03:02.558 --> 00:03:06.278\nEconomic growth matters\npowerfully for the individual.\n\n00:03:07.078 --> 00:03:08.694\nIf growth wanes,\n\n00:03:08.718 --> 00:03:10.734\nthe risk to human progress\n\n00:03:10.758 --> 00:03:15.174\nand the risk of political\nand social instability rises,\n\n00:03:15.198 --> 00:03:19.758\nand societies become dimmer,\ncoarser and smaller.\n\n00:03:20.558 --> 00:03:22.254\nThe context matters.\n\n00:03:22.278 --> 00:03:23.894\nAnd countries in emerging markets\n\n00:03:23.918 --> 00:03:27.758\ndo not need to grow at the same\nrates as developed countries.\n\n00:03:29.198 --> 00:03:33.638\nNow, I know some of you in this room\nfind this to be a risky proposition.\n\n00:03:34.638 --> 00:03:36.494\nThere are some people here\n\n00:03:36.518 --> 00:03:39.054\nwho will turn around\nand be quite disillusioned\n\n00:03:39.078 --> 00:03:40.854\nby what's happened around the world\n\n00:03:40.878 --> 00:03:43.478\nand basically ascribe that\nto economic growth.\n\n00:03:44.198 --> 00:03:47.694\nYou worry about the\noverpopulation of the planet.\n\n00:03:47.718 --> 00:03:50.614\nAnd looking at the UN's\nrecent statistics and projections\n\n00:03:50.638 --> 00:03:53.334\nthat the world will have\n11 billion people on the planet\n\n00:03:53.358 --> 00:03:55.934\nbefore it plateaus in 2100,\n\n00:03:55.958 --> 00:03:59.774\nyou're concerned about what that does\nto natural resources --\n\n00:03:59.798 --> 00:04:03.918\narable land, potable water,\nenergy and minerals.\n\n00:04:04.758 --> 00:04:08.078\nYou are also concerned about\nthe degradation of the environment.\n\n00:04:08.718 --> 00:04:11.854\nAnd you worry about how man,\n\n00:04:11.878 --> 00:04:14.494\nembodied in the corporate globalist,\n\n00:04:14.518 --> 00:04:17.558\nhas become greedy and corrupt.\n\n00:04:18.518 --> 00:04:21.894\nBut I'm here to tell you today\nthat economic growth\n\n00:04:21.918 --> 00:04:25.294\nhas been the backbone\nof changes in living standards\n\n00:04:25.318 --> 00:04:27.278\nof millions of people around the world.\n\n00:04:27.918 --> 00:04:29.734\nAnd more importantly,\n\n00:04:29.758 --> 00:04:34.238\nit's not just economic growth\nthat has been driven by capitalism.\n\n00:04:36.238 --> 00:04:39.694\nThe definition of capitalism,\nvery simply put,\n\n00:04:39.718 --> 00:04:41.774\nis that the factors of production,\n\n00:04:41.798 --> 00:04:45.174\nsuch as trade and industry,\ncapital and labor,\n\n00:04:45.198 --> 00:04:49.118\nare left in the hands\nof the private sector and not the state.\n\n00:04:49.638 --> 00:04:52.374\nIt's really essential here\nthat we understand\n\n00:04:52.398 --> 00:04:57.414\nthat fundamentally the critique\nis not for economic growth per se\n\n00:04:57.438 --> 00:04:59.494\nbut what has happened to capitalism.\n\n00:04:59.518 --> 00:05:03.534\nAnd to the extent that we need to create\neconomic growth over the long term,\n\n00:05:03.558 --> 00:05:08.238\nwe're going to have to pursue it\nwith a better form of economic stance.\n\n00:05:09.278 --> 00:05:12.174\nEconomic growth needs capitalism,\n\n00:05:12.198 --> 00:05:13.878\nbut it needs it to work properly.\n\n00:05:14.798 --> 00:05:17.094\nAnd as I mentioned a moment ago,\n\n00:05:17.118 --> 00:05:23.078\nthe core of the capitalist system\nhas been defined by private actors.\n\n00:05:23.678 --> 00:05:27.734\nAnd even this, however,\nis a very simplistic dichotomy.\n\n00:05:27.758 --> 00:05:30.678\nCapitalism: good; non-capitalism: bad.\n\n00:05:31.078 --> 00:05:33.734\nWhen in practical experience,\n\n00:05:33.758 --> 00:05:36.214\ncapitalism is much more of a spectrum.\n\n00:05:36.238 --> 00:05:38.494\nAnd we have countries such as China,\n\n00:05:38.518 --> 00:05:40.934\nwhich have practiced\nmore state capitalism,\n\n00:05:40.958 --> 00:05:43.054\nand we have countries\nlike the Unites States\n\n00:05:43.078 --> 00:05:44.678\nwhich are more market capitalist.\n\n00:05:45.118 --> 00:05:48.254\nOur efforts to critique\nthe capitalist system, however,\n\n00:05:48.278 --> 00:05:51.494\nhave tended to focus\non countries like China\n\n00:05:51.518 --> 00:05:54.918\nthat are in fact\nnot blatantly market capitalism.\n\n00:05:55.558 --> 00:05:59.214\nHowever, there is\na real reason and real concern\n\n00:05:59.238 --> 00:06:03.894\nfor us to now focus our attentions\non purer forms of capitalism,\n\n00:06:03.918 --> 00:06:06.638\nparticularly those embodied\nby the United States.\n\n00:06:07.238 --> 00:06:09.014\nThis is really important\n\n00:06:09.038 --> 00:06:11.494\nbecause this type of capitalism\n\n00:06:11.518 --> 00:06:14.774\nhas increasingly\nbeen afforded the critique\n\n00:06:14.798 --> 00:06:17.214\nthat it is now fostering corruption\n\n00:06:17.238 --> 00:06:18.614\nand, worse still,\n\n00:06:18.638 --> 00:06:21.278\nit's increasing income inequality --\n\n00:06:22.078 --> 00:06:26.798\nthe idea that the few are benefiting\nat the expense of the many.\n\n00:06:28.718 --> 00:06:31.934\nThe two really critical questions\nthat we need to address\n\n00:06:31.958 --> 00:06:34.654\nis how can we fix capitalism\n\n00:06:34.678 --> 00:06:37.454\nso that it can help create economic growth\n\n00:06:37.478 --> 00:06:40.838\nbut at the same time\ncan help to address social ills.\n\n00:06:41.678 --> 00:06:45.054\nIn order to think about that framing,\nwe have to ask ourselves,\n\n00:06:45.078 --> 00:06:46.798\nhow does capitalism work today?\n\n00:06:47.718 --> 00:06:49.318\nVery simplistically,\n\n00:06:49.918 --> 00:06:55.694\ncapitalism is set on the basis\nof an individual utility maximizer --\n\n00:06:55.718 --> 00:07:00.014\na selfish individual\nwho goes after what he or she wants.\n\n00:07:00.038 --> 00:07:03.174\nAnd only after they've\nmaximized their utility\n\n00:07:03.198 --> 00:07:05.694\ndo they then decide it's important\n\n00:07:05.718 --> 00:07:08.798\nto provide support\nto other social contracts.\n\n00:07:09.318 --> 00:07:12.734\nOf course, in this system\ngovernments do tax,\n\n00:07:12.758 --> 00:07:16.494\nand they use part of their revenues\nto fund social programs,\n\n00:07:16.518 --> 00:07:19.374\nrecognizing that government's role\nis not just regulation\n\n00:07:19.398 --> 00:07:22.678\nbut also to be arbiter of social goods.\n\n00:07:23.278 --> 00:07:24.574\nBut nevertheless,\n\n00:07:24.598 --> 00:07:25.934\nthis framework --\n\n00:07:25.958 --> 00:07:27.934\nthis two-stage framework --\n\n00:07:27.958 --> 00:07:29.934\nis the basis from which we must now start\n\n00:07:29.958 --> 00:07:32.558\nto think about how we can\nimprove the capitalist model.\n\n00:07:33.478 --> 00:07:36.878\nI would argue that there are\ntwo sides to this challenge.\n\n00:07:37.478 --> 00:07:38.694\nFirst of all,\n\n00:07:38.718 --> 00:07:41.654\nwe can draw on the right-wing policies\n\n00:07:41.678 --> 00:07:43.534\nto see what could be beneficial for us\n\n00:07:43.558 --> 00:07:45.678\nto think about how\nwe can improve capitalism.\n\n00:07:46.398 --> 00:07:47.654\nIn particular,\n\n00:07:47.678 --> 00:07:49.414\nright-leaning policies\n\n00:07:49.438 --> 00:07:52.894\nhave tended to focus on things\nlike conditional transfers,\n\n00:07:52.918 --> 00:07:55.934\nwhere we pay and reward people\nfor doing the things\n\n00:07:55.958 --> 00:07:59.414\nthat we actually think\ncan help enhance economic growth.\n\n00:07:59.438 --> 00:08:00.654\nFor example,\n\n00:08:00.678 --> 00:08:02.294\nsending children to school,\n\n00:08:02.318 --> 00:08:04.534\nparents could earn money for that,\n\n00:08:04.558 --> 00:08:07.934\nor getting their children\ninoculated or immunized,\n\n00:08:07.958 --> 00:08:09.838\nparents could get paid for doing that.\n\n00:08:10.318 --> 00:08:12.414\nNow, quite apart from the debate\n\n00:08:12.438 --> 00:08:14.734\non whether or not\nwe should be paying people\n\n00:08:14.758 --> 00:08:17.454\nto do what we think they should do anyway,\n\n00:08:17.478 --> 00:08:20.654\nthe fact of the matter\nis that pay for performance\n\n00:08:20.678 --> 00:08:23.094\nhas actually yielded some positive results\n\n00:08:23.118 --> 00:08:24.814\nin places like Mexico,\n\n00:08:24.838 --> 00:08:26.094\nin Brazil\n\n00:08:26.118 --> 00:08:28.718\nand also in pilot programs in New York.\n\n00:08:29.478 --> 00:08:30.974\nBut there are also benefits\n\n00:08:30.998 --> 00:08:35.358\nand significant changes underway\non left-leaning policies.\n\n00:08:35.838 --> 00:08:40.094\nArguments that government should\nexpand its role and responsibility\n\n00:08:40.118 --> 00:08:42.334\nso that it's not so narrowly defined\n\n00:08:42.358 --> 00:08:44.853\nand that government should be\nmuch more of an arbiter\n\n00:08:44.877 --> 00:08:46.254\nof the factors of production\n\n00:08:46.278 --> 00:08:48.678\nhave become commonplace\nwith the success of China.\n\n00:08:49.358 --> 00:08:51.654\nBut also we've started to have debates\n\n00:08:51.678 --> 00:08:53.934\nabout how the role of the private sector\n\n00:08:53.958 --> 00:08:56.534\nshould move away\nfrom just being a profit motive\n\n00:08:56.558 --> 00:09:00.054\nand really be more engaged\nin the delivery of social programs.\n\n00:09:00.078 --> 00:09:03.294\nThings like the corporate\nsocial responsibility programs,\n\n00:09:03.318 --> 00:09:05.294\nalbeit small in scale,\n\n00:09:05.318 --> 00:09:07.198\nare moving in that right direction.\n\n00:09:07.918 --> 00:09:13.134\nOf course, left-leaning policies\nhave also tended to blur the lines\n\n00:09:13.158 --> 00:09:15.838\nbetween government,\nNGOs and private sector.\n\n00:09:16.758 --> 00:09:20.734\nTwo very good examples of this\nare the 19th-century United States,\n\n00:09:20.758 --> 00:09:22.374\nwhen the infrastructure rollout\n\n00:09:22.398 --> 00:09:25.494\nwas really about\npublic-private partnerships.\n\n00:09:25.518 --> 00:09:26.934\nMore recently, of course,\n\n00:09:26.958 --> 00:09:30.574\nthe advent of the Internet\nhas also proven to the world\n\n00:09:30.598 --> 00:09:34.438\nthat public and private can work together\nfor the betterment of society.\n\n00:09:36.198 --> 00:09:39.254\nMy fundamental message to you is this:\n\n00:09:39.278 --> 00:09:44.694\nWe cannot continue to try and solve\nthe world economic growth challenges\n\n00:09:44.718 --> 00:09:48.878\nby being dogmatic\nand being unnecessarily ideological.\n\n00:09:49.758 --> 00:09:53.574\nIn order to create sustainable,\nlong-term economic growth\n\n00:09:53.598 --> 00:09:57.894\nand solve the challenges and social ills\nthat continue to plague the world today,\n\n00:09:57.918 --> 00:10:00.214\nwe're going to have to be\nmore broad-minded\n\n00:10:00.238 --> 00:10:01.758\nabout what might work.\n\n00:10:02.238 --> 00:10:03.814\nUltimately,\n\n00:10:03.838 --> 00:10:07.974\nwe have to recognize\nthat ideology is the enemy of growth.\n\n00:10:07.998 --> 00:10:09.214\nThank you.\n\n00:10:09.238 --> 00:10:11.478\n(Applause)\n\n00:10:15.118 --> 00:10:18.014\nBruno Giussani: I want to ask\na couple of questions, Dambisa,\n\n00:10:18.038 --> 00:10:20.174\nbecause one could react\nto your last sentence\n\n00:10:20.198 --> 00:10:22.014\nby saying growth is also an ideology,\n\n00:10:22.038 --> 00:10:24.374\nit's possibly the dominant\nideology of our times.\n\n00:10:24.398 --> 00:10:26.494\nWhat do you say\nto those who react that way?\n\n00:10:26.518 --> 00:10:28.974\nDM: Well, I think that that's\ncompletely legitimate,\n\n00:10:28.998 --> 00:10:31.574\nand I think that we're already\nhaving that discussion.\n\n00:10:31.598 --> 00:10:33.814\nThere's a lot of work\ngoing on around happiness\n\n00:10:33.838 --> 00:10:37.334\nand other metrics being used\nfor measuring people's success\n\n00:10:37.358 --> 00:10:39.174\nand improvements in living standards.\n\n00:10:39.198 --> 00:10:41.254\nAnd so I think that we should be open\n\n00:10:41.278 --> 00:10:44.254\nto what could deliver improvements\nin people's living standards\n\n00:10:44.278 --> 00:10:46.534\nand continue to reduce\npoverty around the world.\n\n00:10:46.558 --> 00:10:49.374\nBG: So you're basically pleading\nfor rehabilitating growth,\n\n00:10:49.398 --> 00:10:50.974\nbut the only way for that happen\n\n00:10:50.998 --> 00:10:53.334\nwithout compromising\nthe capacity of the earth,\n\n00:10:53.358 --> 00:10:54.894\nto take us on a long journey,\n\n00:10:54.918 --> 00:10:56.574\nis for

00:11:05.174\nDM: Well, I think that I'm more optimistic\nabout human ability and ingenuity.\n\n00:11:05.198 --> 00:11:07.374\nI think if we start to constrain ourselves\n\n00:11:07.398 --> 00:11:10.454\nusing the finite, scarce\nand depleting resources\n\n00:11:10.478 --> 00:11:11.734\nthat we know today,\n\n00:11:11.758 --> 00:11:13.094\nwe could get quite negative\n\n00:11:13.118 --> 00:11:15.334\nand quite concerned\nabout the way the world is.\n\n00:11:15.358 --> 00:11:17.654\nHowever, we've seen the Club of Rome,\n\n00:11:17.678 --> 00:11:20.094\nwe've seen previous claims\n\n00:11:20.118 --> 00:11:22.454\nthat the world would be\nrunning out of resources,\n\n00:11:22.478 --> 00:11:25.054\nand it's not to argue\nthat those things are not valid.\n\n00:11:25.078 --> 00:11:27.734\nBut I think, with ingenuity\nwe could see desalination,\n\n00:11:27.758 --> 00:11:29.694\nI think we could reinvest in energy,\n\n00:11:29.718 --> 00:11:31.854\nso that we can actually\nget better outcomes.\n\n00:11:31.878 --> 00:11:33.094\nAnd so in that sense,\n\n00:11:33.118 --> 00:11:35.494\nI'm much more optimistic\nabout what humans can do.\n\n00:11:35.518 -->

00:11:58.574\nDM: I'm suggesting\nwe have to be open-minded.\n\n00:11:58.598 --> 00:12:00.814\nI think it is absolutely the case\n\n00:12:00.838 --> 00:12:03.294\nthat traditional models of economic growth\n\n00:12:03.318 --> 00:12:05.734\nare not working the way\nwe would like them to.\n\n00:12:05.758 --> 00:12:07.654\nAnd I think it's no accident\n\n00:12:07.678 --> 00:12:10.974\nthat today the

capitalism,\nwhich is a completely different model.\n\n00:12:28.958 --> 00:12:31.694\nThese two countries,\ncompletely different political models\n\n00:12:31.718 --> 00:12:33.694\nand completely

00:12:39.814\nI think those are the debates\nwe should have,\n\n00:12:39.838 --> 00:12:41.974\nbecause it's not clear at all\n\n00:12:41.998 --> 00:12:43.814\nwhat model we should be adopting,\n\n00:12:43.838 --> 00:12:46.174\nand I think there needs to be\nmuch more discourse\n\n00:12:46.198 --> 00:12:49.614\nand much more humility\nabout what we know and what we don't know.\n\n00:12:49.638 --> 00:12:53.014\nBG: One last question.\nThe COP21 is going on in Paris.\n\n00:12:53.038 --> 00:12:54.534\nIf you could send a tweet\n\n00:12:54.558 --> 00:12:57.854\nto all the heads of state\nand heads of delegations there,\n\n00:12:57.878 --> 00:12:59.254\nwhat would you say?\n\n00:12:59.278 --> 00:13:01.934\nDM: Again, I would be very much\nabout being open-minded.\n\n00:13:01.958 --> 00:13:03.174\nAs you're aware,\n\n00:13:03.198 --> 00:13:05.294\nthe issues around\nthe environmental concerns\n\n00:13:05.318 --> 00:13:07.294\nhave been on the

00:13:15.494\npartly because there is not\na fundamental agreement,\n\n00:13:15.518 --> 00:13:16.774\nin fact there's a schism\n\n00:13:16.798 --> 00:13:19.534\nbetween what the developed\ncountries believe and want\n\n00:13:19.558 --> 00:13:21.894\nand what emerging market countries want.\n\n00:13:21.918 --> 00:13:25.134\nEmerging market countries need\nto continue to create economic growth\n\n00:13:25.158 --> 00:13:28.574\nso that we don't have political\nuncertainty in the those countries.\n\n00:13:28.598 --> 00:13:30.734\nDeveloped countries recognize\n\n00:13:30.758 --> 00:13:33.014\nthat they have a real,\nimportant responsibility\n\n00:13:33.038 --> 00:13:35.854\nnot only just to manage\ntheir CO2 emissions\n\n00:13:35.878 --> 00:13:39.054\nand some of the degradation\nthat they're contributing to the world,\n\n00:13:39.078 --> 00:13:40.854\nbut also as trendsetters in R&amp;D.\n\n00:13:40.878 --> 00:13:43.134\nAnd so they have to come\nto the table as well.\n\n00:13:43.158 --> 00:13:45.614\nBut in essence, it cannot be a situation\n\n00:13:45.638 --> 00:13:49.774\nwhere we start ascribing policies\nto the emerging markets\n\n00:13:49.798 -->

will change work as we know it", "duration": "562", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/sean_follmer_shape_shifting_tech_will_change_work_as_we_know_it", "transcript": "We've evolved with tools, and tools have evolved with us. Our ancestors created these hand axes 1.5 million years ago, shaping them to not only fit the task at hand but also their hand.However, over the years, tools have become more and more specialized. These sculpting tools have evolved through their use, and each one has a different form which matches its function. And they leverage the dexterity of our hands in order to manipulate things with much more precision. But as tools have become more and more complex, we need more complex controls to control them. And so designers have become very adept at creating interfaces that allow you to manipulate parameters while you're attending to other things, such as taking a photograph and changing the focus or the aperture.But the computer has fundamentally changed the way we think about tools because computation is dynamic. So it can do a million different things and run a million different applications. However, computers have the same static physical form for all of these different applications and the same static interface elements as well. And I believe that this is fundamentally a problem, because it doesn't really allow us to interact with our hands and capture the rich dexterity that we have in our bodies. And my belief is that, then, we must need new types of interfaces that can capture these rich abilities that we have and that can physically adapt to us and allow us to interact in new ways. And so that's what I've been doing at the MIT Media Lab and now at Stanford.So with my colleagues, Daniel Leithinger and Hiroshi Ishii, we created inFORM, where the interface can actually come off the screen and you can physically manipulate it. Or you can visualize 3D information physically and touch it and feel it to understand it in new ways. Or you can interact through gestures and direct deformations to sculpt digital clay. Or interface elements can arise out of the surface and change on demand. And the idea is that for each individual application, the physical form can be matched to the application. And I believe this represents a new way that we can interact with information, by making it physical.So the question is, how can we use this? Traditionally, urban planners and architects build physical models of cities and buildings to better understand them. So with Tony Tang at the Media Lab, we created an interface built on inFORM to allow urban planners to design and view entire cities. And now you can walk around it, but it's dynamic, it's physical, and you can also interact directly. Or you can look at different views, such as population or traffic information, but it's made physical.We also believe that these dynamic shape displays can really change the ways that we remotely collaborate with people. So when we're working together in person, I'm not only looking at your face but I'm also gesturing and manipulating objects, and that's really hard to do when you're using tools like Skype. And so using inFORM, you can reach out from the screen and manipulate things at a distance. So we used the pins of the display to represent people's hands, allowing them to actually touch and manipulate objects at a distance. And you can also manipulate and collaborate on 3D data sets as well, so you can gesture around them as well as manipulate them. And that allows people to collaborate on these new types of 3D information in a richer way than might be possible with traditional tools. And so you can also bring in existing objects, and those will be captured on one side and transmitted to the other. Or you can have an object that's linked between two places, so as I move a ball on one side, the ball moves on the other as well. And so we do this by capturing the remote user using a depth-sensing camera like a Microsoft Kinect.Now, you might be wondering how does this all work, and essentially, what it is, is 900 linear actuators that are connected to these mechanical linkages that allow motion down here to be propagated in these pins above. So it's not that complex compared to what's going on at CERN, but it did take a long time for us to build it. And so we started with a single motor, a single linear actuator, and then we had to design a custom circuit board to control them. And then we had to make a lot of them. And so the problem with having 900 of something is that you have to do every step 900 times. And so that meant that we had a lot of work to do. So we sort of set up a mini-sweatshop in the Media Lab and brought undergrads in and convinced them to do \"research\" \u2014(Laughter)and had late nights watching movies, eating pizza and screwing in thousands of screws. You know \u2014 research.(Laughter)But anyway, I think that we were really excited by the things that inFORM allowed us to do. Increasingly, we're using mobile devices, and we interact on the go. But mobile devices, just like computers, are used for so many different applications. So you use them to talk on the phone, to surf the web, to play games, to take pictures or even a million different things. But again, they have the same static physical form for each of these applications. And so we wanted to know how can we take some of the same interactions that we developed for inFORM and bring them to mobile devices.So at Stanford, we created this haptic edge display, which is a mobile device with an array of linear actuators that can change shape, so you can feel in your hand where you are as you're reading a book. Or you can feel in your pocket new types of tactile sensations that are richer than the vibration. Or buttons can emerge from the side that allow you to interact where you want them to be. Or you can play games and have actual buttons. And so we were able to do this by embedding 40 small, tiny linear actuators inside the device, and that allow you not only to touch them but also back-drive them as well.But we've also looked at other ways to create more complex shape change. So we've used pneumatic actuation to create a morphing device where you can go from something that looks a lot like a phone ... to a wristband on the go. And so together with Ken Nakagaki at the Media Lab, we created this new high-resolution version that uses an array of servomotors to change from interactive wristband to a touch-input device to a phone.(Laughter)And we're also interested in looking at ways that users can actually deform the interfaces to shape them into the devices that they want to use. So you can make something like a game controller, and then the system will understand what shape it's in and change to that mode.So, where does this point? How do we move forward from here? I think, really, where we are today is in this new age of the Internet of Things, where we have computers everywhere \u2014 they're in our pockets, they're in our walls, they're in almost every device that you'll buy in the next five years. But what if we stopped thinking about devices and think instead about environments? And so how can we have smart furniture or smart rooms or smart environments or cities that can adapt to us physically, and allow us to do new ways of collaborating with people and doing new types of tasks?So for the Milan Design Week, we created TRANSFORM, which is an interactive table-scale version of these shape displays, which can move physical objects on the surface; for example, reminding you to take your keys. But it can also transform to fit different ways of interacting. So if you want to work, then it can change to sort of set up your work system. And so as you bring a device over, it creates all the affordances you need and brings other objects to help you accomplish those goals.So, in conclusion, I really think that we need to think about a new, fundamentally different way of interacting with computers. We need computers that can physically adapt to us and adapt to the ways that we want to use them and really harness the rich dexterity that we have of our hands, and our ability to think spatially about information by making it physical. But looking forward, I think we need to go beyond this, beyond devices, to really think about new ways that we can bring people together, and bring our information into the world, and think about smart environments that can adapt to us physically. So with that, I will leave you.Thank you very much.(Applause)", "id": 2410, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:12.769 --> 00:00:16.322\nWe've evolved with

it,\nbut it's dynamic, it's physical,\n\n00:03:05.843 --> 00:03:07.543\nand you can also interact directly.\n\n00:03:07.567 --> 00:03:09.305\nOr you can look at different views,\n\n00:03:09.329 --> 00:03:12.146\nsuch as population or traffic information,\n\n00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:13.732\nbut it's made physical.\n\n00:03:14.954 --> 00:03:18.764\nWe also believe that these dynamic\nshape displays can really change\n\n00:03:18.788 --> 00:03:21.748\nthe ways that we remotely\ncollaborate with people.\n\n00:03:21.772 --> 00:03:24.075\nSo when we're working together in person,\n\n00:03:24.099 --> 00:03:25.757\nI'm not only looking at your face\n\n00:03:25.781 --> 00:03:28.819\nbut I'm also gesturing\nand manipulating objects,\n\n00:03:28.843 --> 00:03:32.633\nand that's really hard to do\nwhen you're using tools like Skype.\n\n00:03:33.863 --> 00:03:36.849\nAnd so using inFORM,\nyou can reach out from the screen\n\n00:03:36.873 --> 00:03:38.985\nand manipulate things at a distance.\n\n00:03:39.009 --> 00:03:42.184\nSo we used the pins of the display\nto represent people's hands,\n\n00:03:42.208 --> 00:03:46.714\nallowing them to actually touch\nand manipulate objects at a distance.\n\n00:03:50.477 --> 00:03:54.751\nAnd you can also manipulate\nand collaborate on 3D data sets as well,\n\n00:03:54.775 --> 00:03:58.444\nso you can gesture around them\nas well as manipulate them.\n\n00:03:58.468 --> 00:04:02.858\nAnd that allows people to collaborate\non these new types of 3D information\n\n00:04:02.882 --> 00:04:06.493\nin a richer way than might\nbe possible with traditional tools.\n\n00:04:07.828 --> 00:04:10.581\nAnd so you can also\nbring in existing objects,\n\n00:04:10.605 --> 00:04:13.819\nand those will be captured on one side\nand transmitted to the other.\n\n00:04:13.843 --> 00:04:16.629\nOr you can have an object that's linked\nbetween two places,\n\n00:04:16.653 --> 00:04:18.737\nso as I move a ball on one side,\n\n00:04:18.761 --> 00:04:20.688\nthe ball moves on the other as well.\n\n00:04:22.236 --> 00:04:25.339\nAnd so we do this by capturing\nthe remote user\n\n00:04:25.363 --> 00:04:28.168\nusing a depth-sensing camera\nlike a Microsoft Kinect.\n\n00:04:28.716 --> 00:04:31.733\nNow, you might be wondering\nhow does this all work,\n\n00:04:31.757 --> 00:04:35.408\nand essentially, what it is,\nis 900 linear actuators\n\n00:04:35.432 --> 00:04:37.718\nthat are connected to these\nmechanical linkages\n\n00:04:37.742 --> 00:04:41.488\nthat allow motion down here\nto be propagated in these pins above.\n\n00:04:41.512 --> 00:04:45.079\nSo it's not that complex\ncompared to what's going on at CERN,\n\n00:04:45.103 --> 00:04:47.429\nbut it did take a long time\nfor us to build it.\n\n00:04:47.453 --> 00:04:49.708\nAnd so we started with a single motor,\n\n00:04:49.732 --> 00:04:51.147\na single linear actuator,\n\n00:04:51.774 --> 00:04:54.937\nand then we had to design\na custom circuit board to control them.\n\n00:04:54.961 --> 00:04:57.013\nAnd then we had to make a lot of them.\n\n00:04:57.037 --> 00:05:00.651\nAnd so the problem with having\n900 of something\n\n00:05:00.675 --> 00:05:03.795\nis that you have to do\nevery step 900 times.\n\n00:05:03.819 --> 00:05:06.176\nAnd so that meant that we had\na lot of work to do.\n\n00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:09.932\nSo we sort of set up\na mini-sweatshop in the Media Lab\n\n00:05:09.956 --> 00:05:13.668\nand brought undergrads in and convinced\nthem to do \"research\" --\n\n00:05:13.692 --> 00:05:14.706\n(Laughter)\n\n00:05:14.730 --> 00:05:17.748\nand had late nights\nwatching movies, eating pizza\n\n00:05:17.772 --> 00:05:19.600\nand screwing in thousands of screws.\n\n00:05:19.624 --> 00:05:20.822\nYou know -- research.\n\n00:05:20.846 --> 00:05:22.393\n(Laughter)\n\n00:05:22.417 --> 00:05:25.735\nBut anyway, I think that we were\nreally excited by the things\n\n00:05:25.759 --> 00:05:27.455\nthat inFORM allowed us to do.\n\n00:05:27.479 --> 00:05:31.679\nIncreasingly, we're using mobile devices,\nand we interact on the go.\n\n00:05:31.703 --> 00:05:34.382\nBut mobile devices, just like computers,\n\n00:05:34.406 --> 00:05:36.717\nare used for so many\ndifferent applications.\n\n00:05:36.741 --> 00:05:38.734\nSo you use them to talk on the phone,\n\n00:05:38.758 --> 00:05:41.914\nto surf the web, to play games,\nto take pictures\n\n00:05:41.938 --> 00:05:43.647\nor even a million different things.\n\n00:05:43.671 --> 00:05:46.655\nBut again, they have the same\nstatic physical form\n\n00:05:46.679 --> 00:05:48.797\nfor each of these applications.\n\n00:05:48.821 --> 00:05:52.184\nAnd so we wanted to know how can we take\nsome of the same interactions\n\n00:05:52.208 --> 00:05:53.891\nthat we developed for inFORM\n\n00:05:53.915 --> 00:05:55.803\nand bring them to mobile devices.\n\n00:05:56.385 --> 00:06:00.032\nSo at Stanford, we created\nthis haptic edge display,\n\n00:06:00.056 --> 00:06:03.233\nwhich is a mobile device\nwith an array of linear actuators\n\n00:06:03.257 --> 00:06:04.604\nthat can change shape,\n\n00:06:04.628 --> 00:06:08.525\nso you can feel in your hand\nwhere you are as you're reading a book.\n\n00:06:09.016 --> 00:06:12.753\nOr you can feel in your pocket\nnew types of tactile sensations\n\n00:06:12.777 --> 00:06:14.579\nthat are richer than the vibration.\n\n00:06:14.603 --> 00:06:17.838\nOr buttons can emerge from the side\nthat allow you to interact\n\n00:06:17.862 --> 00:06:19.570\nwhere you want them to be.\n\n00:06:21.292 --> 00:06:24.689\nOr you can play games\nand have actual buttons.\n\n00:06:25.744 --> 00:06:27.260\nAnd so we were able to do this\n\n00:06:27.284 --> 00:06:32.038\nby embedding 40 small, tiny\nlinear actuators inside the device,\n\n00:06:32.062 --> 00:06:34.117\nand that allow you not only to touch them\n\n00:06:34.141 --> 00:06:36.045\nbut also back-drive them as well.\n\n00:06:36.869 --> 00:06:41.047\nBut we've also looked at other ways\nto create more complex shape change.\n\n00:06:41.071 --> 00:06:44.463\nSo we've used pneumatic actuation\nto create a morphing device\n\n00:06:44.487 --> 00:06:48.352\nwhere you can go from something\nthat looks a lot like a phone ...\n\n00:06:48.376 --> 00:06:50.606\nto a wristband on the go.\n\n00:06:51.678 --> 00:06:54.517\nAnd so together with Ken Nakagaki\nat the Media Lab,\n\n00:06:54.541 --> 00:06:57.095\nwe created this new\nhigh-resolution version\n\n00:06:57.119 --> 00:07:03.069\nthat uses an array of servomotors\nto change from interactive wristband\n\n00:07:03.093 --> 00:07:06.221\nto a touch-input device\n\n00:07:06.245 --> 00:07:07.490\nto a phone.\n\n00:07:07.514 --> 00:07:09.172\n(Laughter)\n\n00:07:10.062 --> 00:07:12.234\nAnd we're also interested\nin looking at ways\n\n00:07:12.258 --> 00:07:14.885\nthat users can actually\ndeform the interfaces\n\n00:07:14.909 --> 00:07:17.797\nto shape them into the devices\nthat they want to use.\n\n00:07:17.821 --> 00:07:20.229\nSo you can make something\nlike a game controller,\n\n00:07:20.253 --> 00:07:22.883\nand then the system will understand\nwhat shape it's in\n\n00:07:22.907 --> 00:07:24.526\nand change to that mode.\n\n00:07:26.010 --> 00:07:27.582\nSo, where does this point?\n\n00:07:27.606 --> 00:07:29.534\nHow do we move forward from here?\n\n00:07:29.558 --> 00:07:32.153\nI think, really, where we are today\n\n00:07:32.177 --> 00:07:34.931\nis in this new age\nof the Internet of Things,\n\n00:07:34.955 --> 00:07:36.746\nwhere we have computers everywhere --\n\n00:07:36.770 --> 00:07:38.888\nthey're in our pockets,\nthey're in our walls,\n\n00:07:38.912 --> 00:07:42.478\nthey're in almost every device\nthat you'll buy in the next five years.\n\n00:07:42.502 --> 00:07:45.383\nBut what if we stopped\nthinking about devices\n\n00:07:45.407 --> 00:07:47.801\nand think instead about environments?\n\n00:07:47.825 --> 00:07:50.337\nAnd so how can we have smart furniture\n\n00:07:50.361 --> 00:07:53.677\nor smart rooms or smart environments\n\n00:07:53.701 --> 00:07:56.793\nor cities that can adapt to us physically,\n\n00:07:56.817 --> 00:08:01.048\nand allow us to do new ways\nof collaborating with people\n\n00:08:01.072 --> 00:08:03.310\nand doing new types of tasks?\n\n00:08:03.334 --> 00:08:06.718\nSo for the Milan Design Week,\nwe created TRANSFORM,\n\n00:08:06.742 --> 00:08:10.566\nwhich is an interactive table-scale\nversion of these shape displays,\n\n00:08:10.590 --> 00:08:13.773\nwhich can move physical objects\non the surface; for example,\n\n00:08:13.797 --> 00:08:16.054\nreminding you to take your keys.\n\n00:08:16.078 --> 00:08:20.560\nBut it can also transform\nto fit different ways of interacting.\n\n00:08:20.584 --> 00:08:21.901\nSo if you want to work,\n\n00:08:21.925 --> 00:08:24.917\nthen it can change to sort of\nset up your work system.\n\n00:08:24.941 --> 00:08:26.892\nAnd so as you bring a device over,\n\n00:08:26.916 --> 00:08:29.654\nit creates all the affordances you need\n\n00:08:29.678 --> 00:08:34.478\nand brings other objects\nto help you accomplish those goals.\n\n00:08:37.097 --> 00:08:38.658\nSo, in conclusion,\n\n00:08:38.682 --> 00:08:42.681\nI really think that we need to think\nabout a new, fundamentally different way\n\n00:08:42.705 --> 00:08:44.863\nof interacting with computers.\n\n00:08:45.509 --> 00:08:48.463\nWe need computers\nthat can physically adapt to us\n\n00:08:48.487 --> 00:08:51.088\nand adapt to the ways\nthat we want to use them\n\n00:08:51.112 --> 00:08:55.659\nand really harness the rich dexterity\nthat we have of our hands,\n\n00:08:55.683 --> 00:08:59.954\nand our ability to think spatially\nabout information by making it physical.\n\n00:09:00.621 --> 00:09:04.617\nBut looking forward, I think we need\nto go beyond this, beyond devices,\n\n00:09:04.641 --> 00:09:08.034\nto really think about new ways\nthat we can bring people together,\n\n00:09:08.058 --> 00:09:11.076\nand bring our information into the world,\n\n00:09:11.100 --> 00:09:15.053\nand think about smart environments\nthat can adapt to us physically.\n\n00:09:15.077 --> 00:09:16.641\nSo with that, I will leave you.\n\n00:09:16.665 --> 00:09:17.816\nThank you very much.\n\n00:09:17.840 --> 00:09:21.432\n(Applause)"}, {"title": "How I'm discovering the secrets of ancient texts", "duration": "727", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/gregory_heyworth_how_i_m_discovering_the_secrets_of_ancient_texts", "transcript": "On January 26, 2013, a band of al-Qaeda militants entered the ancient city of Timbuktu on the southern edge of the Sahara Desert. There, they set fire to a medieval library of 30,000 manuscripts written in Arabic and several African languages and ranging in subject from astronomy to geography, history to medicine, including one book which records perhaps the first treatment for male erectile dysfunction. Unknown in the West, this was the collected wisdom of an entire continent, the voice of Africa at a time when Africa was thought not to have a voice at all. The mayor of Bamako, who witnessed the event, called the burning of the manuscripts \"a crime against world cultural heritage.\" And he was right \u2014 or he would have been, if it weren't for the fact that he was also lying.In fact, just before, African scholars had collected a random assortment of old books and left them out for the terrorists to burn. Today, the collection lies hidden in Bamako, the capital of Mali, moldering in the high humidity. What was rescued by ruse is now once again in jeopardy, this time by climate.But Africa, and the far-flung corners of the world, are not the only places, or even the main places in which manuscripts that could change the history of world culture are in jeopardy. Several years ago, I conducted a survey of European research libraries and discovered that, at the barest minimum, there are 60,000 manuscripts pre-1500 that are illegible because of water damage, fading, mold and chemical reagents. The real number is likely double that, and that doesn't even count Renaissance manuscripts and modern manuscripts and cultural heritage objects such as maps.What if there were a technology that could recover these lost and unknown works? Imagine worldwide how a trove of hundreds of thousands of previously unknown texts could radically transform our knowledge of the past. Imagine what unknown classics we would discover which would rewrite the canons of literature, history, philosophy, music \u2014 or, more provocatively, that could rewrite our cultural identities, building new bridges between people and culture. These are the questions that transformed me from a medieval scholar, a reader of texts, into a textual scientist.What an unsatisfying word \"reader\" is. For me, it conjures up images of passivity, of someone sitting idly in an armchair waiting for knowledge to come to him in a neat little parcel. How much better to be a participant in the past, an adventurer in an undiscovered country, searching for the hidden text. As an academic, I was a mere reader. I read and taught the same classics that people had been reading and teaching for hundreds of years \u2014 Virgil, Ovid, Chaucer, Petrarch \u2014 and with every scholarly article that I published I added to human knowledge in ever-diminishing slivers of insight. What I wanted to be was an archaeologist of the past, a discoverer of literature, an Indiana Jones without the whip \u2014 or, actually, with the whip.(Laughter) And I wanted it not just for myself but I wanted it for my students as well.And so six years ago, I changed the direction of my career. At the time, I was working on \"The Chess of Love,\" the last important long poem of the European Middle Ages never to have been edited. And it wasn't edited because it existed in only one manuscript which was so badly damaged during the firebombing of Dresden in World War II that generations of scholars had pronounced it lost. For five years, I had been working with an ultraviolet lamp trying to recover traces of the writing and I'd gone about as far as technology at the time could actually take me.And so I did what many people do. I went online, and there I learned about how multispectral imaging had been used to recover two lost treatises of the famed Greek mathematician Archimedes from a 13th-century palimpsest. A palimpsest is a manuscript which has been erased and overwritten.And so, out of the blue, I decided to write to the lead imaging scientist on the Archimedes palimpsest project, Professor Roger Easton, with a plan and a plea. And to my surprise, he actually wrote back. With his help, I was able to win a grant from the US government to build a transportable, multispectral imaging lab, And with this lab, I transformed what was a charred and faded mess into a new medieval classic.So how does multispectral imaging actually work? Well, the idea behind multispectral imaging is something that anyone who is familiar with infrared night vision goggles will immediately appreciate: that what we can see in the visible spectrum of light is only a tiny fraction of what's actually there. The same is true with invisible writing. Our system uses 12 wavelengths of light between the ultraviolet and the infrared, and these are shown down onto the manuscript from above from banks of LEDs, and another multispectral light source which comes up through the individual leaves of the manuscript. Up to 35 images per sequence per leaf are imaged this way using a high-powered digital camera equipped with a lens which is made out of quartz. There are about five of these in the world. And once we capture these images, we feed them through statistical algorithms to further enhance and clarify them, using software which was originally designed for satellite images and used by people like geospatial scientists and the CIA.The results can be spectacular. You may already have heard of what's been done for the Dead Sea Scrolls, which are slowly gelatinizing. Using infrared, we've been able to read even the darkest corners of the Dead Sea Scrolls. You may not be aware, however, of other Biblical texts that are in jeopardy.Here, for example, is a leaf from a manuscript that we imaged, which is perhaps the most valuable Christian Bible in the world. The Codex Vercellensis is the oldest translation of the Gospels into Latin, and it dates from the first half of the fourth century. This is the closest we can come to the Bible at the time of the foundation of Christendom under Emperor Constantine, and at the time also of the Council of Nicaea, when the basic creed of Christianity was being agreed upon. This manuscript, unfortunately, has been very badly damaged, and it's damaged because for centuries it had been used and handled in swearing in ceremonies in the church. In fact, that purple splotch that you see in the upper left hand corner is Aspergillus, which is a fungus which originates in the unwashed hands of a person with tuberculosis. Our imaging has enabled me to make the first transcription of this manuscript in 250 years.Having a lab that can travel to collections where it's needed, however, is only part of the solution. The technology is expensive and very rare, and the imaging and image processing skills are esoteric. That means that mounting recoveries is beyond the reach of most researchers and all but the wealthiest institutions. That's why I founded the Lazarus Project, a not-for-profit initiative to bring multispectral imaging to individual researchers and smaller institutions at little or no cost whatsoever. Over the past five years, our team of imaging scientists, scholars and students has travelled to seven different countries and have recovered some of the world's most valuable damaged manuscripts, included the Vercelli Book, which is the oldest book of English, the Black Book of Carmarthen, the oldest book of Welsh, and some of the most valuable earliest Gospels located in what is now the former Soviet Georgia.So, spectral imaging can recover lost texts. More subtly, though, it can recover a second story behind every object, the story of how, when and by whom a text was created, and, sometimes, what the author was thinking at the time he wrote. Take, for example, a draft of the Declaration of Independence written in Thomas Jefferson's own hand, which some colleagues of mine imaged a few years ago at the Library of Congress. Curators had noticed that one word throughout had been scratched out and overwritten. The word overwritten was \"citizens.\" Perhaps you can guess what the word underneath was. \"Subjects.\" There, ladies and gentlemen, is American democracy evolving under the hand of Thomas Jefferson.Or consider the 1491 Martellus Map, which we imaged at Yale's Beinecke Library. This was the map that Columbus likely consulted before he traveled to the New World and which gave him his idea of what Asia looked like and where Japan was located. The problem with this map is that its inks and pigments had so degraded over time that this large, nearly seven-foot map, made the world look like a giant desert. Until now, we had very little idea, detailed idea, that is, of what Columbus knew of the world and how world cultures were represented. The main legend of the map was entirely illegible under normal light. Ultraviolet did very little for it. Multispectral gave us everything. In Asia, we learned of monsters with ears so long that they could cover the creature's entire body. In Africa, about a snake who could cause the ground to smoke. Like starlight, which can convey images of the way the Universe looked in the distant past, so multispectral light can take us back to the first stuttering moments of an object's creation. Through this lens, we witness the mistakes, the changes of mind, the na\u00efvet\u00e9s, the uncensored thoughts, the imperfections of the human imagination that allow these hallowed objects and their authors to become more real, that make history closer to us.What about the future? There's so much of the past, and so few people with the skills to rescue it before these objects disappear forever. That's why I have begun to teach this new hybrid discipline that I call \"textual science.\" Textual science is a marriage of the traditional skills of a literary scholar \u2014 the ability to read old languages and old handwriting, the knowledge of how texts are made in order to be able to place and date them \u2014 with new techniques like imaging science, the chemistry of inks and pigments, computer-aided optical character recognition.Last year, a student in my class, a freshman, with a background in Latin and Greek, was image-processing a palimpsest that we had photographed at a famous library in Rome. As he worked, tiny Greek writing began to appear from behind the text. Everyone gathered around, and he read a line from a lost work of the Greek comic dramatist Menander. This was the first time in well over a thousand years that those words had been pronounced aloud.

city of Timbuktu\n\n00:00:18.958 --> 00:00:20.958\non the southern edge of the Sahara Desert.\n\n00:00:21.598 --> 00:00:26.214\nThere, they set fire to a medieval library\nof 30,000 manuscripts\n\n00:00:26.238 --> 00:00:29.014\nwritten in Arabic\nand several African languages\n\n00:00:29.038 --> 00:00:34.774\nand ranging in subject from astronomy\nto geography, history to medicine,\n\n00:00:34.798 --> 00:00:36.494\nincluding one book which records\n\n00:00:36.518 --> 00:00:40.438\nperhaps the first treatment\nfor male erectile dysfunction.\n\n00:00:41.718 --> 00:00:43.014\nUnknown in the West,\n\n00:00:43.038 --> 00:00:46.454\nthis was the collected wisdom\nof an entire continent,\n\n00:00:46.478 --> 00:00:50.558\nthe voice of Africa at a time when Africa\nwas thought not to have a voice at all.\n\n00:00:51.438 --> 00:00:53.934\nThe mayor of Bamako,\nwho witnessed the event,\n\n00:00:53.958 --> 00:00:55.894\ncalled the burning of the manuscripts\n\n00:00:55.918 --> 00:00:58.158\n\"a crime against world cultural heritage.\"\n\n00:00:58.838 --> 00:01:00.374\nAnd he was right --\n\n00:01:00.398 --> 00:01:03.838\nor he would have been, if it weren't\nfor the fact that he was also lying.\n\n00:01:04.518 --> 00:01:07.254\nIn fact, just before,\n\n00:01:07.278 --> 00:01:11.414\nAfrican scholars had collected\na random assortment of old books\n\n00:01:11.438 --> 00:01:13.934\nand left them out\nfor the terrorists to burn.\n\n00:01:13.958 --> 00:01:16.894\nToday, the collection\nlies hidden in Bamako,\n\n00:01:16.917 --> 00:01:18.294\nthe capital of Mali,\n\n00:01:18.318 --> 00:01:20.414\nmoldering in the high humidity.\n\n00:01:20.438 --> 00:01:22.294\nWhat was rescued by ruse\n\n00:01:22.318 --> 00:01:24.054\nis now once again in jeopardy,\n\n00:01:24.078 --> 00:01:25.318\nthis time by climate.\n\n00:01:26.158 --> 00:01:28.574\nBut Africa, and the far-flung\ncorners of the world,\n\n00:01:28.598 --> 00:01:30.894\nare not the only places,\nor even the main places\n\n00:01:30.918 --> 00:01:35.214\nin which manuscripts that could change\nthe history of world culture\n\n00:01:35.238 --> 00:01:36.758\nare in jeopardy.\n\n00:01:37.878 --> 00:01:42.614\nSeveral years ago, I conducted\na survey of European research libraries\n\n00:01:42.638 --> 00:01:44.894\nand discovered that,\nat the barest minimum,\n\n00:01:44.918 --> 00:01:48.134\nthere are 60,000 manuscripts\n\n00:01:48.158 --> 00:01:49.774\npre-1500\n\n00:01:49.798 --> 00:01:52.734\nthat are illegible\nbecause of water

doesn't even count\n\n00:02:01.958 --> 00:02:04.574\nRenaissance manuscripts\nand modern manuscripts\n\n00:02:04.598 --> 00:02:07.718\nand cultural heritage\nobjects such as maps.\n\n00:02:09.918 --> 00:02:12.374\nWhat if there were a technology\n\n00:02:12.398 --> 00:02:17.734\nthat could recover\nthese lost and unknown works?\n\n00:02:17.758 --> 00:02:22.174\nImagine worldwide\nhow a trove of hundreds of thousands\n\n00:02:22.198 --> 00:02:25.134\nof previously unknown texts\n\n00:02:25.158 --> 00:02:28.198\ncould radically transform\nour knowledge of the past.\n\n00:02:30.238 --> 00:02:34.254\nImagine what unknown classics\nwe would discover\n\n00:02:34.278 --> 00:02:37.614\nwhich would rewrite the canons\nof literature, history,\n\n00:02:37.638 --> 00:02:39.078\nphilosophy, music --\n\n00:02:39.798 --> 00:02:43.334\nor, more provocatively, that could\nrewrite our cultural identities,\n\n00:02:43.358 --> 00:02:46.718\nbuilding new bridges\nbetween people and culture.\n\n00:02:47.478 --> 00:02:50.014\nThese are the questions\nthat transformed me\n\n00:02:50.038 --> 00:02:52.854\nfrom a medieval scholar,\na reader of texts,\n\n00:02:52.878 --> 00:02:54.678\ninto a textual scientist.\n\n00:02:56.078 --> 00:02:58.374\nWhat an unsatisfying word \"reader\" is.\n\n00:02:58.398 --> 00:03:00.974\nFor me, it conjures up\nimages of passivity,\n\n00:03:00.998 --> 00:03:03.414\nof someone sitting idly in an armchair\n\n00:03:03.438 --> 00:03:05.734\nwaiting for knowledge to come to him\n\n00:03:05.758 --> 00:03:07.454\nin a neat little parcel.\n\n00:03:07.478 --> 00:03:10.494\nHow much better to be\na participant in the past,\n\n00:03:10.518 --> 00:03:13.694\nan adventurer in an undiscovered country,\n\n00:03:13.718 --> 00:03:16.118\nsearching for the hidden text.\n\n00:03:17.318 --> 00:03:19.758\nAs an academic, I was a mere reader.\n\n00:03:20.518 --> 00:03:22.934\nI read and taught the same classics\n\n00:03:22.958 --> 00:03:26.094\nthat people had been reading\nand teaching for hundreds of years --\n\n00:03:26.118 --> 00:03:29.134\nVirgil, Ovid, Chaucer, Petrarch --\n\n00:03:29.158 --> 00:03:31.494\nand with every scholarly article\nthat I published\n\n00:03:31.518 --> 00:03:34.718\nI added to human knowledge\nin ever-diminishing slivers of insight.\n\n00:03:36.718 --> 00:03:38.294\nWhat I wanted to be\n\n00:03:38.318 --> 00:03:40.414\nwas an archaeologist of the past,\n\n00:03:40.438 --> 00:03:42.014\na discoverer of literature,\n\n00:03:42.038 --> 00:03:43.934\nan Indiana Jones without the whip --\n\n00:03:43.958 --> 00:03:45.454\nor, actually, with the whip.\n\n00:03:45.478 --> 00:03:46.694\n(Laughter)\n\n00:03:46.718 --> 00:03:50.414\nAnd I wanted it not just for myself\nbut I wanted it for my students as well.\n\n00:03:50.438 --> 00:03:54.334\nAnd so six years ago,\nI changed the direction of my career.\n\n00:03:54.358 --> 00:03:57.374\nAt the time, I was working\non \"The Chess of Love,\"\n\n00:03:57.398 --> 00:04:00.254\nthe last important long poem\nof the European Middle Ages\n\n00:04:00.278 --> 00:04:01.894\nnever to have been edited.\n\n00:04:01.918 --> 00:04:04.934\nAnd it wasn't edited because\nit existed in only one manuscript\n\n00:04:04.958 --> 00:04:08.214\nwhich was so badly damaged\nduring the firebombing of Dresden\n\n00:04:08.238 --> 00:04:09.454\nin World War II\n\n00:04:09.478 --> 00:04:12.358\nthat generations of scholars\nhad pronounced it lost.\n\n00:04:13.358 --> 00:04:16.814\nFor five years, I had been working\nwith an ultraviolet lamp\n\n00:04:16.838 --> 00:04:18.734\ntrying to recover traces of the writing\n\n00:04:18.758 --> 00:04:21.174\nand I'd gone about as far\nas technology at the time\n\n00:04:21.198 --> 00:04:22.574\ncould actually take me.\n\n00:04:22.598 --> 00:04:24.694\nAnd so I did what many people do.\n\n00:04:24.718 --> 00:04:26.734\nI went online,\n\n00:04:26.758 --> 00:04:28.494\nand there I learned about\n\n00:04:28.518 --> 00:04:33.094\nhow multispectral imaging had been used\nto recover two lost treatises\n\n00:04:33.118 --> 00:04:36.014\nof the famed Greek\nmathematician Archimedes\n\n00:04:36.038 --> 00:04:37.574\nfrom a 13th-century palimpsest.\n\n00:04:37.598 --> 00:04:40.878\nA palimpsest is a manuscript\nwhich has been erased and overwritten.\n\n00:04:42.158 --> 00:04:43.414\nAnd so, out of the blue,\n\n00:04:43.438 --> 00:04:46.494\nI decided to write\nto the lead imaging scientist\n\n00:04:46.518 --> 00:04:48.734\non the Archimedes palimpsest project,\n\n00:04:48.758 --> 00:04:50.254\nProfessor Roger Easton,\n\n00:04:50.278 --> 00:04:52.094\nwith a plan and a plea.\n\n00:04:52.118 --> 00:04:54.158\nAnd to my surprise,\nhe actually wrote back.\n\n00:04:55.958 --> 00:04:59.614\nWith his help, I was able\nto win a grant from the US government\n\n00:04:59.638 --> 00:05:03.654\nto build a transportable,\nmultispectral imaging lab,\n\n00:05:03.678 --> 00:05:08.494\nAnd with this lab, I transformed\nwhat was a charred and faded mess\n\n00:05:08.518 --> 00:05:10.518\ninto a new medieval classic.\n\n00:05:11.318 --> 00:05:14.094\nSo how does multispectral\nimaging actually work?\n\n00:05:14.118 --> 00:05:16.574\nWell, the idea\nbehind multispectral imaging\n\n00:05:16.598 --> 00:05:20.894\nis something that anyone who is familiar\nwith infrared night vision goggles\n\n00:05:20.918 --> 00:05:22.294\nwill immediately appreciate:\n\n00:05:22.318 --> 00:05:24.814\nthat what we can see\nin the visible spectrum of light\n\n00:05:24.838 --> 00:05:27.158\nis only a tiny fraction\nof what's actually there.\n\n00:05:27.678 --> 00:05:29.878\nThe same is true with invisible writing.\n\n00:05:31.238 --> 00:05:35.414\nOur system uses 12 wavelengths of light\n\n00:05:35.438 --> 00:05:37.934\nbetween the ultraviolet and the infrared,\n\n00:05:37.958 --> 00:05:41.014\nand these are shown down\nonto the manuscript from above\n\n00:05:41.038 --> 00:05:42.654\nfrom banks of LEDs,\n\n00:05:42.678 --> 00:05:44.534\nand another multispectral light source\n\n00:05:44.558 --> 00:05:47.511\nwhich comes up through\nthe individual leaves of the manuscript.\n\n00:05:47.535 --> 00:05:52.054\nUp to 35 images per sequence\nper leaf are imaged this way\n\n00:05:52.078 --> 00:05:54.698\nusing a high-powered digital camera\nequipped with a lens\n\n00:05:54.722 --> 00:05:56.694\nwhich is made out of quartz.\n\n00:05:56.718 --> 00:05:58.814\nThere are about five\nof these in the world.\n\n00:05:58.838 --> 00:06:00.654\nAnd once we capture these images,\n\n00:06:00.678 --> 00:06:02.734\nwe feed them through\nstatistical algorithms\n\n00:06:02.758 --> 00:06:05.254\nto further enhance and clarify them,\n\n00:06:05.278 --> 00:06:08.654\nusing software which was originally\ndesigned for satellite images\n\n00:06:08.678 --> 00:06:12.054\nand used by people\nlike geospatial scientists\n\n00:06:12.078 --> 00:06:13.278\nand the CIA.\n\n00:06:13.998 --> 00:06:16.294\nThe results can be spectacular.\n\n00:06:16.318 --> 00:06:18.494\nYou may already have heard\nof what's been done\n\n00:06:18.518 --> 00:06:19.894\nfor the Dead Sea Scrolls,\n\n00:06:19.918 --> 00:06:21.478\nwhich are slowly gelatinizing.\n\n00:06:22.438 --> 00:06:26.094\nUsing infrared, we've been able\nto read even the darkest corners\n\n00:06:26.118 --> 00:06:27.838\nof the Dead Sea Scrolls.\n\n00:06:28.838 --> 00:06:30.294\nYou may not be aware, however,\n\n00:06:30.318 --> 00:06:33.054\nof other Biblical texts\nthat are in jeopardy.\n\n00:06:33.078 --> 00:06:36.494\nHere, for example,\nis a leaf from a manuscript\n\n00:06:36.518 --> 00:06:38.294\nthat we imaged,\n\n00:06:38.318 --> 00:06:42.198\nwhich is perhaps the most valuable\nChristian Bible in the world.\n\n00:06:42.838 --> 00:06:48.614\nThe Codex Vercellensis is the oldest\ntranslation of the Gospels into Latin,\n\n00:06:48.638 --> 00:06:51.238\nand it dates from the first half\nof the fourth century.\n\n00:06:52.518 --> 00:06:54.774\nThis is the closest we can come\n\n00:06:54.798 --> 00:06:58.734\nto the Bible at the time\nof the foundation of Christendom\n\n00:06:58.758 --> 00:07:00.374\nunder Emperor Constantine,\n\n00:07:00.398 --> 00:07:02.934\nand at the time also\nof the Council of Nicaea,\n\n00:07:02.958 --> 00:07:06.454\nwhen the basic creed of Christianity\nwas being agreed upon.\n\n00:07:06.478 --> 00:07:09.734\nThis manuscript, unfortunately,\nhas been very badly damaged,\n\n00:07:09.758 --> 00:07:11.974\nand it's damaged because for centuries\n\n00:07:11.998 --> 00:07:14.454\nit had been used and handled\n\n00:07:14.478 --> 00:07:17.174\nin swearing in ceremonies in the church.\n\n00:07:17.198 --> 00:07:21.854\nIn fact, that purple splotch\nthat you see in the upper left hand corner\n\n00:07:21.878 --> 00:07:26.174\nis Aspergillus, which is a fungus\n\n00:07:26.198 --> 00:07:29.734\nwhich originates in the unwashed hands\n\n00:07:29.758 --> 00:07:31.758\nof a person with tuberculosis.\n\n00:07:32.598 --> 00:07:35.654\nOur imaging has enabled me\nto make the first transcription\n\n00:07:35.678 --> 00:07:38.278\nof this manuscript in 250 years.\n\n00:07:39.758 --> 00:07:43.214\nHaving a lab that can travel\nto collections where it's needed, however,\n\n00:07:43.238 --> 00:07:44.718\nis only part of the solution.\n\n00:07:45.438 --> 00:07:48.294\nThe technology is expensive and very rare,\n\n00:07:48.318 --> 00:07:51.534\nand the imaging and image\nprocessing skills are esoteric.\n\n00:07:51.558 --> 00:07:53.254\nThat means that mounting recoveries\n\n00:07:53.278 --> 00:07:58.174\nis beyond the reach of most researchers\nand all but the wealthiest institutions.\n\n00:07:58.198 --> 00:08:00.974\nThat's why I founded the Lazarus Project,\n\n00:08:00.998 --> 00:08:02.654\na not-for-profit initiative\n\n00:08:02.678 --> 00:08:06.654\nto bring multispectral imaging\nto individual researchers\n\n00:08:06.678 --> 00:08:10.518\nand smaller institutions\nat little or no cost whatsoever.\n\n00:08:11.518 --> 00:08:13.134\nOver the past five years,\n\n00:08:13.158 --> 00:08:17.014\nour team of imaging scientists,\nscholars and students\n\n00:08:17.038 --> 00:08:19.214\nhas travelled to seven different countries\n\n00:08:19.238 --> 00:08:23.094\nand have recovered some of the world's\nmost valuable damaged manuscripts,\n\n00:08:23.118 --> 00:08:26.118\nincluded the Vercelli Book,\nwhich is the oldest book of English,\n\n00:08:26.142 --> 00:08:28.758\nthe Black Book of Carmarthen,\nthe oldest book of Welsh,\n\n00:08:28.782 --> 00:08:32.254\nand some of the most valuable\nearliest Gospels\n\n00:08:32.278 --> 00:08:35.158\nlocated in what is now\nthe former Soviet Georgia.\n\n00:08:36.558 --> 00:08:39.518\nSo, spectral imaging\ncan recover lost texts.\n\n00:08:40.318 --> 00:08:45.414\nMore subtly, though, it can recover\na second story behind every object,\n\n00:08:45.438 --> 00:08:50.134\nthe story of how, when\nand by whom a text was created,\n\n00:08:50.158 --> 00:08:53.558\nand, sometimes, what the author\nwas thinking at the time he wrote.\n\n00:08:54.558 --> 00:08:57.654\nTake, for example, a draft\nof the Declaration of Independence\n\n00:08:57.678 --> 00:09:00.094\nwritten in Thomas Jefferson's own hand,\n\n00:09:00.118 --> 00:09:02.547\nwhich some colleagues of mine\nimaged a few years ago\n\n00:09:02.571 --> 00:09:03.891\nat the Library of Congress.\n\n00:09:04.318 --> 00:09:07.014\nCurators had noticed\nthat one word throughout\n\n00:09:07.038 --> 00:09:09.414\nhad been scratched out and overwritten.\n\n00:09:09.438 --> 00:09:11.518\nThe word overwritten was \"citizens.\"\n\n00:09:12.198 --> 00:09:14.798\nPerhaps you can guess\nwhat the word underneath was.\n\n00:09:15.918 --> 00:09:17.334\n\"Subjects.\"\n\n00:09:17.358 --> 00:09:20.174\nThere, ladies and gentlemen,\nis American democracy\n\n00:09:20.198 --> 00:09:22.278\nevolving under the hand\nof Thomas Jefferson.\n\n00:09:23.318 --> 00:09:27.174\nOr consider the 1491 Martellus Map,\n\n00:09:27.198 --> 00:09:29.534\nwhich we imaged\nat Yale's Beinecke Library.\n\n00:09:29.558 --> 00:09:32.014\nThis

It hasn't always been this way. In fact, all across the globe, people have been gaining height. In the last 150 years, in developed countries, on average, we have gotten 10 centimeters taller. And scientists have a lot of theories about why this is, but almost all of them involve nutrition, namely the increase of dairy and meat.In the last 50 years, global meat consumption has more than quadrupled, from 71 million tons to 310 million tons. Something similar has been going on with milk and eggs. In every society where incomes have risen, so has protein consumption. And we know that globally, we are getting richer. And as the middle class is on the rise, so is our global population, from 7 billion of us today to 9.7 billion by 2050, which means that by 2050, we are going to need at least 70 percent more protein than what is available to humankind today. And the latest prediction of the UN puts that population number, by the end of this century, at 11 billion, which means that we are going to need a lot more protein.This challenge is staggering \u2014 so much so, that recently, a team at Anglia Ruskin Global Sustainability Institute suggested that if we don't change our global policies and food production systems, our societies might actually collapse in the next 30 years.Currently, our ocean serves as the main source of animal protein. Over 2.6 billion people depend on it every single day. At the same time, our global fisheries are two-and-a-half times larger than what our oceans can sustainably support, meaning that humans take far more fish from the ocean than the oceans can naturally replace.WWF recently published a report showing that just in the last 40 years, our global marine life has been slashed in half. And another recent report suggests that of our largest predatory species, such as swordfish and bluefin tuna, over 90 percent has disappeared since the 1950s.And there are a lot of great, sustainable fishing initiatives across the planet working towards better practices and better-managed fisheries. But ultimately, all of these initiatives are working towards keeping current catch constant. It's unlikely, even with the best-managed fisheries, that we are going to be able to take much more from the ocean than we do today.We have to stop plundering our oceans the way we have. We need to alleviate the pressure on it. And we are at a point where if we push much harder for more produce, we might face total collapse. Our current systems are not going to feed a growing global population.So how do we fix this? What's the world going to look like in just 35 short years when there's 2.7 billion more of us sharing the same resources? We could all become vegan. Sounds like a great idea, but it's not realistic and it's impossibly hard to mandate globally.People are eating animal protein whether we like it or not. And suppose we fail to change our ways and continue on the current path, failing to meet demands.The World Health Organization recently reported that 800 million people are suffering from malnutrition and food shortage, which is due to that same growing, global population and the declining access to resources like water, energy and land. It takes very little imagination to picture a world of global unrest, riots and further malnutrition. People are hungry, and we are running dangerously low on natural resources. For so, so many reasons, we need to change our global food production systems.We must do better and there is a solution. And that solution lies in aquaculture \u2014 the farming of fish, plants like seaweed, shellfish and crustaceans. As the great ocean hero Jacques Cousteau once said, \"We must start using the ocean as farmers instead of hunters. That's what civilization is all about \u2014 farming instead of hunting.\" Fish is the last food that we hunt.And why is it that we keep hearing phrases like, \"Life's too short for farmed fish,\" or, \"Wild-caught, of course!\" over fish that we know virtually nothing about? We don't know what it ate during its lifetime, and we don't know what pollution it encounters. And if it was a large predatory species, it might have gone through the coast of Fukushima yesterday. We don't know. Very few people realize the traceability in fisheries never goes beyond the hunter that caught the wild animal.But let's back up for a second and talk about why fish is the best food choice. It's healthy, it prevents heart disease, it provides key amino acids and key fatty acids like Omega-3s, which is very different from almost any other type of meat. And aside from being healthy, it's also a lot more exciting and diverse.Think about it \u2014 most animal farming is pretty monotonous. Cow is cow, sheep is sheep, pig's pig, and poultry \u2014 turkey, duck, chicken \u2014 pretty much sums it up. And then there's 500 species of fish being farmed currently. not that Western supermarkets reflect that on their shelves, but that's beside that point.And you can farm fish in a very healthy manner that's good for us, good for the planet and good for the fish. I know I sound fish-obsessed \u2014(Laughter)Let me explain: My brilliant partner and wife, Amy Novograntz, and I got involved in aquaculture a couple of years ago. We were inspired by Sylvia Earle, who won the TED Prize in 2009. We actually met on Mission Blue I in the Galapagos. Amy was there as the TED Prize Director; me, an entrepreneur from the Netherlands and concerned citizen, love to dive, passion for the oceans.Mission Blue truly changed our lives. We fell in love, got married and we came away really inspired, thinking we really want to do something about ocean conservation \u2014 something that was meant to last, that could make a real difference and something that we could do together.Little did we expect that that would lead us to fish farming. But a few months after we got off the boat, we got to a meeting at Conservation International, where the Director General of WorldFish was talking about aquaculture, asking a room full of environmentalists to stop turning from it, realize what was going on and to really get involved because aquaculture has the potential to be just what our oceans and populations need.We were stunned when we heard the stats that we didn't know more about this industry already and excited about the chance to help get it right.And to talk about stats \u2014 right now, the amount of fish consumed globally, wild catch and farmed combined, is twice the tonnage of the total amount of beef produced on planet earth last year. Every single fishing vessel combined, small and large, across the globe, together produce about 65 million tons of wild-caught seafood for human consumption.Aquaculture this year, for the first time in history, actually produces more than what we catch from the wild.But now this: Demand is going to go up. In the next 35 years, we are going to need an additional 85 million tons to meet demand, which is one-and-a-half times as much, almost, as what we catch globally out of our oceans. An enormous number.It's safe to assume that that's not going to come from the ocean. It needs to come from farming. And talk about farming \u2014 for farming you need resources. As a human needs to eat to grow and stay alive, so does an animal. A cow needs to eat eight to nine pounds of feed and drink almost 8,000 liters of water to create just one pound of meat. Experts agree that it's impossible to farm cows for every inhabitant on this planet. We just don't have enough feed or water.And we can't keep cutting down rain forests for it. And fresh water \u2014 planet earth has a very limited supply. We need something more efficient to keep humankind alive on this planet.And now let's compare that with fish farming. You can farm one pound of fish with just one pound of feed, and depending on species, even less. And why is that? Well, that's because fish, first of all, float. They don't need to stand around all day resisting gravity like we do. And most fish are cold-blooded \u2014 they don't need to heat themselves. Fish chills.(Laughter)And it needs very little water, which is counterintuitive, but as we say, it swims in it but it hardly drinks it. Fish are the most resource-efficient animal protein available to humankind, aside from insects.How much we've learned since. For example, on top of that 65 million tons that's annually caught for human consumption, there's an additional 30 million tons caught for animal feed, mostly sardines and anchovies for the aquaculture industry that's turned into fish meal and fish oil.This is madness. Sixty-five percent of these fisheries, globally, are badly managed. Some of the worst issues of our time are connected to it. It's destroying our oceans. The worst slavery issues imaginable are connected to it. Recently, an article came out of Stanford saying that if 50 percent of the world's aquaculture industry would stop using fish meal, our oceans would be saved. Now think about that for a minute.Now, we know that the oceans have far more problems \u2014 they have pollution, there's acidification, coral reef destruction and so on. But it underlines the impact of our fisheries, and it underlines how interconnected everything is. Fisheries, aquaculture, deforestation, climate change, food security and so on.In the search for alternatives, the industry, on a massive scale, has reverted to plant-based alternatives like soy, industrial chicken waste, blood meal from slaughterhouses and so on.And we understand where these choices come from, but this is not the right approach. It's not sustainable, it's not healthy. Have you ever seen a chicken at the bottom of the ocean? Of course not. If you feed salmon soy with nothing else, it literally explodes. Salmon is a carnivore, it has no way to digest soy.Now, fish farming is by far the best animal farming available to humankind. But it's had a really bad reputation. There's been excessive use of chemicals, there's been virus and disease transfered to wild populations, ecosystem destruction and pollution, escaped fish breeding with wild populations, altering the overall genetic pool, and then of course, as just mentioned, the unsustainable feed ingredients.How blessed were the days when we could just enjoy food that was on our plate, whatever it was. Once you know, you know. You can't go back. It's not fun. We really need a transparent food system that we can trust, that produces healthy food.But the good news is that decades of development and research have led to a lot of new technologies and knowledge that allow us to do a lot better. We can now farm fish without any of these issues.I think of agriculture before the green revolution \u2014 we are at aquaculture and the blue revolution. New technologies means that we can now produce a feed that's perfectly natural, with a minimal footprint that consists of microbes, insects, seaweeds and micro-algae. Healthy for the people, healthy for the fish, healthy for the planet.Microbes, for example, can be a perfect alternative for high-grade fish meal \u2014 at scale.Insects are the \u2014 well, first of all, the perfect recycling because they're grown on food waste; but second, think of fly-fishing, and you know how logical it actually is to use it as fish feed. You don't need large tracts of land for it and you don't need to cut down rain forests for it. And microbes and insects are actually net water producers.This revolution is starting as we speak, it just needs scale. We can now farm far more species than ever before in controlled, natural conditions, creating happy fish.I imagine, for example, a closed system that's performing more efficiently than insect farming, where you can produce healthy, happy, delicious fish with little or no effluent, almost no energy and almost no water and a natural feed with a minimal footprint. Or a system where you grow up to 10 species next to each other \u2014 off of each other, mimicking nature. You need very little feed, very little footprint. I think of seaweed growing off the effluent of fish, for example.There's great technologies popping up all over the globe. From alternatives to battle disease so we don't need antibiotics and chemicals anymore, to automated feeders that feel when the fish are hungry, so we can save on feed and create less pollution. Software systems that gather data across farms, so we can improve farm practices.There's really cool stuff happening all over the globe. And make no mistake \u2014 all of these things are possible at a cost that's competitive to what a farmer spends today. Tomorrow, there will be no excuse for anyone to not do the right thing.So somebody needs to connect the dots and give these developments a big kick in the butt. And that's what we've been working on the last couple of years, and that's what we need to be working on together \u2014 rethinking everything from the ground up, with a holistic view across the value chain, connecting all these things across the globe, alongside great entrepreneurs that are willing to share a collective vision.Now is the time to create change in this industry and to push it into a sustainable direction. This industry is still young, much of its growth is still ahead. It's a big task, but not as far-fetched as you might think. It's possible.So we need to take pressure off the ocean. We want to eat good and healthy. And if we eat an animal, it needs to be one that had a happy and healthy life.We need to have a meal that we can trust, live long lives. And this is not just for people in San Francisco or Northern Europe \u2014 this is for all of us. Even in the poorest countries, it's not just about money. People prefer something fresh and healthy that they can trust over something that comes from far away that they know nothing about. We're all the same.The day will come where people will realize \u2014 no, demand \u2014 farmed fish on their plate that's farmed well and that's farmed healthy \u2014 and refuse anything less.You can help speed this up. Ask questions when you order seafood. Where does my fish come from? Who raised it, and what did it eat? Information about where your fish comes from and how it was produced needs to be much more readily available. And consumers need to put pressure on the aquaculture industry to do the right thing.So every time you order, ask for detail and show that you really care about what you eat and what's been given to you. And eventually, they will listen. And all of us will benefit.Thank you.(Applause)", "id": 2427, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:12.781 --> 00:00:15.149\nSo I come from the tallest\npeople

push much harder\nfor more produce,\n\n00:02:44.759 --> 00:02:46.458\nwe might face total collapse.\n\n00:02:47.184 --> 00:02:51.827\nOur current systems are not going to feed\na growing global population.\n\n00:02:52.818 --> 00:02:54.087\nSo how do we fix this?\n\n00:02:54.111 --> 00:02:56.849\nWhat's the world going to look like\nin just 35 short years\n\n00:02:56.873 --> 00:03:00.472\nwhen there's 2.7 billion more of us\nsharing the same resources?\n\n00:03:01.017 --> 00:03:02.889\nWe could all become vegan.\n\n00:03:02.913 --> 00:03:04.666\nSounds like a great idea,\n\n00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:05.994\nbut it's not realistic\n\n00:03:06.018 --> 00:03:08.363\nand it's impossibly hard\nto mandate globally.\n\n00:03:08.935 --> 00:03:11.971\nPeople are eating animal protein\nwhether we like it or not.\n\n00:03:12.522 --> 00:03:14.354\nAnd suppose we fail to change our ways\n\n00:03:14.378 --> 00:03:16.504\nand continue on the current path,\n\n00:03:16.528 --> 00:03:18.362\nfailing to meet demands.\n\n00:03:18.386 --> 00:03:20.608\nThe World Health Organization\nrecently reported\n\n00:03:20.632 --> 00:03:24.794\nthat 800 million people are suffering\nfrom malnutrition and food shortage,\n\n00:03:24.818 --> 00:03:28.229\nwhich is due to that same\ngrowing, global population\n\n00:03:28.253 --> 00:03:32.275\nand the declining access to resources\nlike water, energy and land.\n\n00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:35.230\nIt takes very little imagination\n\n00:03:35.254 --> 00:03:40.204\nto picture a world of global unrest,\nriots and further malnutrition.\n\n00:03:40.228 --> 00:03:41.854\nPeople are hungry,\n\n00:03:41.878 --> 00:03:44.916\nand we are running dangerously low\non natural resources.\n\n00:03:45.286 --> 00:03:46.842\nFor so, so many reasons,\n\n00:03:46.866 --> 00:03:49.620\nwe need to change our global\nfood production systems.\n\n00:03:50.213 --> 00:03:51.637\nWe must do better\n\n00:03:51.661 --> 00:03:52.826\nand there is a solution.\n\n00:03:52.850 --> 00:03:55.435\nAnd that solution lies in aquaculture --\n\n00:03:55.459 --> 00:03:59.405\nthe farming of fish, plants like seaweed,\nshellfish and crustaceans.\n\n00:03:59.819 --> 00:04:02.248\nAs the great ocean hero\nJacques Cousteau once said,\n\n00:04:02.272 --> 00:04:05.146\n\"We must start using the ocean\nas farmers instead of hunters.\n\n00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:08.700\nThat's what civilization is all about --\nfarming instead of hunting.\"\n\n00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:11.788\nFish is the last food that we hunt.\n\n00:04:12.332 --> 00:04:15.640\nAnd why is it that we keep\nhearing phrases like,\n\n00:04:15.664 --> 00:04:17.347\n\"Life's too short for farmed fish,\"\n\n00:04:17.371 --> 00:04:18.959\nor, \"Wild-caught, of course!\"\n\n00:04:18.983 --> 00:04:21.332\nover fish that we know\nvirtually nothing about?\n\n00:04:21.356 --> 00:04:23.567\nWe don't know what it ate\nduring its lifetime,\n\n00:04:23.591 --> 00:04:25.783\nand we don't know what\npollution it encounters.\n\n00:04:25.787 --> 00:04:27.697\nAnd if it was a large predatory species,\n\n00:04:27.731 --> 00:04:30.560\nit might have gone through the coast\nof Fukushima yesterday.\n\n00:04:30.584 --> 00:04:31.928\nWe don't know.\n\n00:04:31.952 --> 00:04:33.295\nVery few people realize\n\n00:04:33.319 --> 00:04:36.961\nthe traceability in fisheries\nnever goes beyond the hunter\n\n00:04:36.985 --> 00:04:38.500\nthat caught the wild animal.\n\n00:04:38.524 --> 00:04:39.961\nBut let's back up for a second\n\n00:04:39.985 --> 00:04:42.572\nand talk about why fish\nis the best food choice.\n\n00:04:42.596 --> 00:04:43.747\nIt's healthy,\n\n00:04:43.771 --> 00:04:45.027\nit prevents heart disease,\n\n00:04:45.051 --> 00:04:46.494\nit provides key amino acids\n\n00:04:46.518 --> 00:04:49.271\nand key fatty acids like Omega-3s,\n\n00:04:49.295 --> 00:04:52.172\nwhich is very different from almost\nany other type of meat.\n\n00:04:52.196 --> 00:04:53.806\nAnd aside from being healthy,\n\n00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:56.427\nit's also a lot more exciting and diverse.\n\n00:04:56.451 --> 00:04:59.634\nThink about it -- most animal farming\nis pretty monotonous.\n\n00:04:59.658 --> 00:05:02.309\nCow is cow, sheep is sheep, pig's pig,\n\n00:05:02.333 --> 00:05:06.410\nand poultry -- turkey, duck, chicken --\npretty much sums it up.\n\n00:05:06.434 --> 00:05:11.249\nAnd then there's 500 species of fish\nbeing farmed currently.\n\n00:05:11.273 --> 00:05:14.201\nnot that Western supermarkets\nreflect that on their shelves,\n\n00:05:14.225 --> 00:05:15.622\nbut that's beside that point.\n\n00:05:15.646 --> 00:05:18.397\nAnd you can farm fish\nin a very healthy manner\n\n00:05:18.437 --> 00:05:21.437\nthat's good for us, good for the planet\nand good for the fish.\n\n00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:23.956\nI know I sound fish-obsessed --\n\n00:05:23.980 --> 00:05:26.106\n(Laughter)\n\n00:05:26.130 --> 00:05:27.281\nLet me explain:\n\n00:05:27.305 --> 00:05:30.464\nMy brilliant partner and wife,\nAmy Novograntz, and I got involved\n\n00:05:30.488 --> 00:05:32.439\nin aquaculture a couple of years ago.\n\n00:05:32.463 --> 00:05:34.735\nWe were inspired by Sylvia Earle,\n\n00:05:34.759 --> 00:05:37.055\nwho won the TED Prize in 2009.\n\n00:05:37.079 --> 00:05:40.213\nWe actually met on Mission Blue I\nin the Galapagos.\n\n00:05:41.115 --> 00:05:43.052\nAmy was there as the TED Prize Director;\n\n00:05:43.076 --> 00:05:46.266\nme, an entrepreneur from the Netherlands\nand concerned citizen,\n\n00:05:46.290 --> 00:05:48.663\nlove to dive, passion for the oceans.\n\n00:05:49.250 --> 00:05:51.584\nMission Blue truly changed our lives.\n\n00:05:51.608 --> 00:05:52.759\nWe fell in love,\n\n00:05:52.783 --> 00:05:54.259\ngot married\n\n00:05:54.283 --> 00:05:56.524\nand we came away really inspired,\n\n00:05:56.548 --> 00:05:59.757\nthinking we really want to do something\nabout ocean conservation --\n\n00:05:59.781 --> 00:06:01.516\nsomething that was meant to last,\n\n00:06:01.540 --> 00:06:04.096\nthat could make a real difference\n\n00:06:04.120 --> 00:06:06.746\nand something that we could do together.\n\n00:06:07.699 --> 00:06:10.989\nLittle did we expect that that would\nlead us to fish farming.\n\n00:06:11.699 --> 00:06:13.797\nBut a few months after\nwe got off the boat,\n\n00:06:13.821 --> 00:06:16.355\nwe got to a meeting\nat Conservation International,\n\n00:06:16.379 --> 00:06:20.406\nwhere the Director General of WorldFish\nwas talking about aquaculture,\n\n00:06:20.430 --> 00:06:24.176\nasking a room full of environmentalists\nto stop turning from it,\n\n00:06:24.200 --> 00:06:25.961\nrealize what was going on\n\n00:06:25.985 --> 00:06:27.406\nand to really get involved\n\n00:06:27.430 --> 00:06:29.542\nbecause aquaculture has the potential\n\n00:06:29.566 --> 00:06:32.652\nto be just what our oceans\nand populations need.\n\n00:06:33.142 --> 00:06:35.025\nWe were stunned when we heard the stats\n\n00:06:35.049 --> 00:06:37.585\nthat we didn't know more\nabout this industry already\n\n00:06:37.609 --> 00:06:40.516\nand excited about the chance\nto help get it right.\n\n00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:42.747\nAnd to talk about stats --\n\n00:06:42.771 --> 00:06:45.547\nright now, the amount of fish\nconsumed globally,\n\n00:06:45.571 --> 00:06:47.627\nwild catch and farmed combined,\n\n00:06:47.651 --> 00:06:49.983\nis twice the tonnage\nof the total amount of beef\n\n00:06:50.007 --> 00:06:51.880\nproduced on planet earth last year.\n\n00:06:52.397 --> 00:06:54.704\nEvery single fishing vessel combined,\n\n00:06:54.728 --> 00:06:56.659\nsmall and large, across the globe,\n\n00:06:56.683 --> 00:07:00.560\ntogether produce about 65 million tons\nof wild-caught seafood\n\n00:07:00.584 --> 00:07:01.981\nfor human consumption.\n\n00:07:02.581 --> 00:07:03.887\nAquaculture this year,\n\n00:07:03.911 --> 00:07:05.490\nfor the first time in history,\n\n00:07:05.514 --> 00:07:08.371\nactually produces more\nthan what we catch from the wild.\n\n00:07:08.832 --> 00:07:09.983\nBut now this:\n\n00:07:10.007 --> 00:07:11.361\nDemand is going to go up.\n\n00:07:12.115 --> 00:07:13.624\nIn the next 35 years,\n\n00:07:13.648 --> 00:07:18.643\nwe are going to need an additional\n85 million tons to meet demand,\n\n00:07:18.667 --> 00:07:21.262\nwhich is one-and-a-half times\nas much, almost,\n\n00:07:21.286 --> 00:07:23.845\nas what we catch globally\nout of our oceans.\n\n00:07:25.098 --> 00:07:26.424\nAn enormous number.\n\n00:07:26.770 --> 00:07:29.869\nIt's safe to assume that that's not\ngoing to come from the ocean.\n\n00:07:29.893 --> 00:07:31.562\nIt needs to come from farming.\n\n00:07:32.121 --> 00:07:33.436\nAnd talk about farming --\n\n00:07:33.460 --> 00:07:35.427\nfor farming you need resources.\n\n00:07:36.271 --> 00:07:39.200\nAs a human needs to eat\nto grow and stay alive,\n\n00:07:39.224 --> 00:07:40.697\nso does an animal.\n\n00:07:40.721 --> 00:07:43.616\nA cow needs to eat\neight to nine pounds of feed\n\n00:07:43.640 --> 00:07:46.091\nand drink almost 8,000 liters of water\n\n00:07:46.115 --> 00:07:47.995\nto create just one pound of meat.\n\n00:07:48.493 --> 00:07:50.536\nExperts agree that it's impossible\n\n00:07:50.560 --> 00:07:53.712\nto farm cows for every\ninhabitant on this planet.\n\n00:07:53.736 --> 00:07:56.474\nWe just don't have enough feed or water.\n\n00:07:56.498 --> 00:07:59.252\nAnd we can't keep cutting down\nrain forests for it.\n\n00:07:59.276 --> 00:08:02.785\nAnd fresh water -- planet earth\nhas a very limited supply.\n\n00:08:02.809 --> 00:08:04.920\nWe need something more efficient\n\n00:08:04.944 --> 00:08:07.825\nto keep humankind alive on this planet.\n\n00:08:08.475 --> 00:08:10.622\nAnd now let's compare\nthat with fish farming.\n\n00:08:11.122 --> 00:08:15.060\nYou can farm one pound of fish\nwith just one pound of feed,\n\n00:08:15.084 --> 00:08:17.416\nand depending on species, even less.\n\n00:08:17.803 --> 00:08:19.033\nAnd why is that?\n\n00:08:20.057 --> 00:08:22.826\nWell, that's because fish,\nfirst of all, float.\n\n00:08:22.850 --> 00:08:26.436\nThey don't need to stand around all day\nresisting gravity like we do.\n\n00:08:26.764 --> 00:08:28.518\nAnd most fish are cold-blooded --\n\n00:08:28.542 --> 00:08:30.222\nthey don't need to heat themselves.\n\n00:08:30.246 --> 00:08:31.414\nFish chills.\n\n00:08:31.438 --> 00:08:33.059\n(Laughter)\n\n00:08:33.083 --> 00:08:34.623\nAnd it needs very little water,\n\n00:08:34.647 --> 00:08:35.925\nwhich is counterintuitive,\n\n00:08:35.949 --> 00:08:37.336\nbut as we say,\n\n00:08:37.360 --> 00:08:39.754\nit swims in it but it hardly drinks it.\n\n00:08:39.778 --> 00:08:44.191\nFish are the most resource-efficient\nanimal protein available to humankind,\n\n00:08:44.215 --> 00:08:45.650\naside from insects.\n\n00:08:47.255 --> 00:08:48.869\nHow much we've learned since.\n\n00:08:49.440 --> 00:08:52.877\nFor example, on top of that\n65 million tons that's annually caught\n\n00:08:52.901 --> 00:08:54.511\nfor human consumption,\n\n00:08:54.535 --> 00:08:58.522\nthere's an additional 30 million tons\ncaught for animal feed,\n\n00:08:58.546 --> 00:09:02.087\nmostly sardines and anchovies\nfor the aquaculture industry\n\n00:09:02.111 --> 00:09:04.148\nthat's turned into fish meal and fish oil.\n\n00:09:04.560 --> 00:09:05.907\nThis is madness.\n\n00:09:06.506 --> 00:09:10.078\nSixty-five percent of these fisheries,\nglobally, are badly managed.\n\n00:09:10.102 --> 00:09:12.812\nSome of the worst issues\nof our time are connected to it.\n\n00:09:12.836 --> 00:09:14.134\nIt's destroying our oceans.\n\n00:09:14.158 --> 00:09:17.176\nThe worst slavery issues\nimaginable are connected to it.\n\n00:09:17.660 --> 00:09:20.470\nRecently, an article came out of Stanford\n\n00:09:20.494 --> 00:09:23.367\nsaying that if 50 percent\nof the world's aquaculture industry\n\n00:09:23.391 --> 00:09:24.693\nwould stop using fish meal,\n\n00:09:24.717 --> 00:09:26.367\nour oceans would be saved.\n\n00:09:26.795 --> 00:09:28.450\nNow think about that for a minute.\n\n00:09:28.474 --> 00:09:31.494\nNow, we know that the oceans\nhave far more problems --\n\n00:09:31.518 --> 00:09:34.303\nthey have pollution,\nthere's acidification,\n\n00:09:34.327 --> 00:09:35.910\ncoral reef destruction and so on.\n\n00:09:35.934 --> 00:09:38.471\nBut it underlines the impact\nof our fisheries,\n\n00:09:38.495 --> 00:09:41.070\nand it underlines how\ninterconnected everything is.\n\n00:09:41.566 --> 00:09:45.182\nFisheries, aquaculture, deforestation,\n\n00:09:45.206 --> 00:09:48.240\nclimate change, food security and so on.\n\n00:09:48.792 --> 00:09:50.294\nIn the search for alternatives,\n\n00:09:50.318 --> 00:09:52.373\nthe industry, on a massive scale,\n\n00:09:52.397 --> 00:09:54.560\nhas reverted to plant-based alternatives\n\n00:09:54.584 --> 00:09:57.437\nlike soy, industrial chicken waste,\n\n00:09:57.461 --> 00:09:59.303\nblood meal from slaughterhouses\n\n00:09:59.327 --> 00:10:00.582\nand so on.\n\n00:10:00.606 --> 00:10:03.070\nAnd we understand where\nthese choices come from,\n\n00:10:03.094 --> 00:10:05.223\nbut this is not the right approach.\n\n00:10:05.247 --> 00:10:06.502\nIt's not sustainable,\n\n00:10:06.526 --> 00:10:07.700\nit's not healthy.\n\n00:10:07.724 --> 00:10:10.387\nHave you ever seen a chicken\nat the bottom of the ocean?\n\n00:10:10.411 --> 00:10:11.762\nOf course not.\n\n00:10:11.786 --> 00:10:13.982\nIf you feed salmon soy with nothing else,\n\n00:10:14.006 --> 00:10:15.768\nit literally explodes.\n\n00:10:16.421 --> 00:10:17.573\nSalmon is a carnivore,\n\n00:10:17.597 --> 00:10:19.492\nit has no way to digest soy.\n\n00:10:21.007 --> 00:10:23.129\nNow, fish farming is by far\n\n00:10:23.153 --> 00:10:25.470\nthe best animal farming\navailable to humankind.\n\n00:10:25.494 --> 00:10:27.866\nBut it's had a really bad reputation.\n\n00:10:28.331 --> 00:10:30.510\nThere's been excessive use of chemicals,\n\n00:10:30.534 -->

plate,\n\n00:10:49.092 --> 00:10:50.297\nwhatever it was.\n\n00:10:50.783 --> 00:10:52.322\nOnce you know, you know.\n\n00:10:52.346 --> 00:10:53.552\nYou can't go back.\n\n00:10:53.576 --> 00:10:54.727\nIt's not fun.\n\n00:10:54.751 --> 00:10:57.940\nWe really need a transparent food\nsystem that we can trust,\n\n00:10:57.964 --> 00:10:59.638\nthat produces healthy food.\n\n00:11:00.684 --> 00:11:01.883\nBut the good news is\n\n00:11:01.907 --> 00:11:04.820\nthat decades of development and research\n\n00:11:04.844 --> 00:11:07.306\nhave led to a lot of new\ntechnologies and knowledge\n\n00:11:07.330 --> 00:11:09.142\nthat allow us to do a lot better.\n\n00:11:09.166 --> 00:11:11.812\nWe can now farm fish\nwithout any of these issues.\n\n00:11:12.506 --> 00:11:15.387\nI think of agriculture\nbefore the green revolution --\n\n00:11:15.411 --> 00:11:18.434\nwe are at aquaculture\nand the blue revolution.\n\n00:11:19.775 --> 00:11:21.012\nNew technologies means\n\n00:11:21.036 --> 00:11:24.604\nthat we can now produce a feed\nthat's perfectly natural,\n\n00:11:24.628 --> 00:11:25.812\nwith a minimal footprint\n\n00:11:25.836 --> 00:11:29.781\nthat consists of microbes, insects,\nseaweeds and micro-algae.\n\n00:11:30.647 --> 00:11:31.950\nHealthy for the people,\n\n00:11:31.974 --> 00:11:33.125\nhealthy for the fish,\n\n00:11:33.149 --> 00:11:34.470\nhealthy for the planet.\n\n00:11:35.251 --> 00:11:36.401\nMicrobes, for example,\n\n00:11:36.425 --> 00:11:39.274\ncan be a perfect alternative\nfor high-grade fish meal --\n\n00:11:39.298 --> 00:11:40.453\nat scale.\n\n00:11:40.759 --> 00:11:42.842\nInsects are the --\n\n00:11:42.866 --> 00:11:44.827\nwell, first of all, the perfect recycling\n\n00:11:44.851 --> 00:11:46.581\nbecause they're grown on food waste;\n\n00:11:46.605 --> 00:11:47.757\nbut second,\n\n00:11:47.781 --> 00:11:48.932\nthink of fly-fishing,\n\n00:11:48.956 --> 00:11:52.269\nand you know how logical\nit actually is to use it as fish feed.\n\n00:11:52.670 --> 00:11:54.693\nYou don't need large tracts of land for it\n\n00:11:54.717 --> 00:11:57.127\nand you don't need\nto cut down rain forests for it.\n\n00:11:57.828 --> 00:12:00.917\nAnd microbes and insects are actually\nnet water producers.\n\n00:12:01.467 --> 00:12:03.696\nThis revolution is starting as we speak,\n\n00:12:03.720 --> 00:12:05.197\nit just needs scale.\n\n00:12:06.450 --> 00:12:09.517\nWe can now farm far more\nspecies than ever before\n\n00:12:09.541 --> 00:12:13.178\nin controlled, natural conditions,\ncreating happy fish.\n\n00:12:13.855 --> 00:12:15.139\nI imagine, for example,\n\n00:12:15.163 --> 00:12:20.771\na closed system that's performing\nmore efficiently than insect farming,\n\n00:12:20.795 --> 00:12:24.039\nwhere you can produce\nhealthy, happy, delicious fish\n\n00:12:24.063 --> 00:12:25.435\nwith little or no effluent,\n\n00:12:25.459 --> 00:12:27.919\nalmost no energy and almost no water\n\n00:12:27.943 --> 00:12:30.252\nand a natural feed\nwith a minimal footprint.\n\n00:12:31.042 --> 00:12:34.269\nOr a system where you grow\nup to 10 species next to each other --\n\n00:12:34.293 --> 00:12:35.669\noff of each other,\n\n00:12:35.693 --> 00:12:37.133\nmimicking nature.\n\n00:12:37.876 --> 00:12:39.246\nYou need very little feed,\n\n00:12:39.270 --> 00:12:40.492\nvery little footprint.\n\n00:12:40.516 --> 00:12:44.417\nI think of seaweed growing\noff the effluent of fish, for example.\n\n00:12:46.411 --> 00:12:49.206\nThere's great technologies\npopping up all over the globe.\n\n00:12:49.532 --> 00:12:51.711\nFrom alternatives to battle disease\n\n00:12:51.735 --> 00:12:54.600\nso we don't need antibiotics\nand chemicals anymore,\n\n00:12:54.624 --> 00:12:58.280\nto automated feeders that feel\nwhen the fish are hungry,\n\n00:12:58.304 --> 00:13:01.595\nso we can save on feed\nand create less pollution.\n\n00:13:01.974 --> 00:13:04.577\nSoftware systems that gather\ndata across farms,\n\n00:13:04.601 --> 00:13:06.487\nso we can improve farm practices.\n\n00:13:07.085 --> 00:13:09.941\nThere's really cool stuff\nhappening all over the globe.\n\n00:13:10.628 --> 00:13:13.271\nAnd make no mistake --\nall of these things are possible\n\n00:13:13.295 --> 00:13:16.430\nat a cost that's competitive\nto what a farmer spends today.\n\n00:13:16.982 --> 00:13:20.929\nTomorrow, there will be no excuse\nfor anyone to not do the right thing.\n\n00:13:22.122 --> 00:13:24.381\nSo somebody needs to connect the dots\n\n00:13:24.405 --> 00:13:26.988\nand give these developments\na big kick in the butt.\n\n00:13:27.012 --> 00:13:30.029\nAnd that's what we've been working on\nthe last couple of years,\n\n00:13:30.053 --> 00:13:32.539\nand that's what we need\nto be working on together --\n\n00:13:33.007 --> 00:13:35.358\nrethinking everything from the ground up,\n\n00:13:35.382 --> 00:13:37.901\nwith a holistic view\nacross the value chain,\n\n00:13:37.925 --> 00:13:40.059\nconnecting all these things\nacross the globe,\n\n00:13:40.083 -->

this industry\n\n00:13:48.289 --> 00:13:50.500\nand to push it into\na sustainable direction.\n\n00:13:50.524 --> 00:13:51.946\nThis industry is still young,\n\n00:13:51.970 --> 00:13:53.662\nmuch of its growth is still ahead.\n\n00:13:53.999 --> 00:13:56.833\nIt's a big task, but not\nas far-fetched as you might think.\n\n00:13:56.857 --> 00:13:58.007\nIt's possible.\n\n00:13:58.990 --> 00:14:01.167\nSo we need to take pressure off the ocean.\n\n00:14:01.191 --> 00:14:02.738\nWe want to eat good and healthy.\n\n00:14:02.762 --> 00:14:04.834\nAnd if we eat an animal,\nit needs to be one\n\n00:14:04.858 --> 00:14:06.516\nthat had a happy and healthy life.\n\n00:14:06.540 --> 00:14:08.747\nWe need to have a meal that we can trust,\n\n00:14:08.771 --> 00:14:09.984\nlive long lives.\n\n00:14:10.535 --> 00:14:14.434\nAnd this is not just for people\nin San Francisco or Northern Europe --\n\n00:14:14.458 --> 00:14:16.304\nthis is for all of us.\n\n00:14:16.328 --> 00:14:17.988\nEven in the poorest countries,\n\n00:14:18.012 --> 00:14:19.522\nit's not just about money.\n\n00:14:19.546 --> 00:14:23.362\nPeople prefer something fresh\nand healthy that they can trust\n\n00:14:23.386 --> 00:14:27.178\nover something that comes from far away\nthat they know nothing about.\n\n00:14:27.202 --> 00:14:28.518\nWe're all the same.\n\n00:14:30.225 --> 00:14:31.376\nThe day will come\n\n00:14:31.400 --> 00:14:34.641\nwhere people will realize -- no, demand --\nfarmed fish on their plate\n\n00:14:34.685 --> 00:14:37.042\nthat's farmed well\nand that's farmed healthy --\n\n00:14:38.162 --> 00:14:39.416\nand refuse anything less.\n\n00:14:39.440 --> 00:14:40.809\nYou can help speed this up.\n\n00:14:41.121 --> 00:14:43.479\nAsk questions when you order seafood.\n\n00:14:43.503 --> 00:14:45.360\nWhere does my fish come from?\n\n00:14:45.384 --> 00:14:46.899\nWho raised it,\n\n00:14:46.923 --> 00:14:48.288\nand what did it eat?\n\n00:14:48.966 --> 00:14:52.625\nInformation about where your fish\ncomes from and how it was produced\n\n00:14:52.649 --> 00:14:54.791\nneeds to be much more readily available.\n\n00:14:55.621 --> 00:14:58.805\nAnd consumers need to put pressure\non the aquaculture industry\n\n00:14:58.829 --> 00:15:00.121\nto do the right thing.\n\n00:15:00.611 --> 00:15:02.654\nSo every time you order,\n\n00:15:02.678 --> 00:15:04.645\nask for detail\n\n00:15:04.669 --> 00:15:07.151\nand show that you really care\nabout what you eat\n\n00:15:07.175 --> 00:15:08.605\nand what's been given to you.\n\n00:15:08.957 --> 00:15:11.301\nAnd eventually, they will listen.\n\n00:15:11.325 --> 00:15:13.122\nAnd all of us will benefit.\n\n00:15:13.533 --> 00:15:14.684\nThank you.\n\n00:15:14.708 -->

"15 years ago, I volunteered to participate in a research study that involved a genetic test. When I arrived at the clinic to be tested, I was handed a questionnaire. One of the very first questions asked me to check a box for my race: White, black, Asian, or Native American.I wasn't quite sure how to answer the question. Was it aimed at measuring the diversity of research participants' social backgrounds? In that case, I would answer with my social identity, and check the box for \"black.\" But what if the researchers were interested in investigating some association between ancestry and the risk for certain genetic traits? In that case, wouldn't they want to know something about my ancestry, which is just as much European as African? And how could they make scientific findings about my genes if I put down my social identity as a black woman? After all, I consider myself a black woman with a white father rather than a white woman with a black mother entirely for social reasons. Which racial identity I check has nothing to do with my genes. Well, despite the obvious importance of this question to the study's scientific validity, I was told, \"Don't worry about it, just put down however you identify yourself.\" So I check \"black,\" but I had no confidence in the results of a study that treated a critical variable so unscientifically.That personal experience with the use of race in genetic testing got me thinking: Where else in medicine is race used to make false biological predictions?Well, I found out that race runs deeply throughout all of medical practice. It shapes physicians' diagnoses, measurements, treatments, prescriptions, even the very definition of diseases. And the more I found out, the more disturbed I became.Sociologists like me have long explained that race is a social construction. When we identify people as black, white, Asian, Native American, Latina, we're referring to social groupings with made up demarcations that have changed over time and vary around the world. As a legal scholar, I've also studied how lawmakers, not biologists, have invented the legal definitions of races.And it's not just the view of social scientists. You remember when the map of the human genome was unveiled at a White House ceremony in June 2000? President Bill Clinton famously declared, \"I believe one of the great truths to emerge from this triumphant expedition inside the human genome is that in genetic terms, human beings, regardless of race, are more than 99.9 percent the same.\" And he might have added that that less than one percent of genetic difference doesn't fall into racial boxes.Francis Collins, who led the Human Genome Project and now heads NIH, echoed President Clinton. \"I am happy that today, the only race we're talking about is the human race.\"Doctors are supposed to practice evidence-based medicine, and they're increasingly called to join the genomic revolution. But their habit of treating patients by race lags far behind.Take the estimate of glomerular filtration rate, or GFR. Doctors routinely interpret GFR, this important indicator of kidney function, by race. As you can see in this lab test, the exact same creatinine level, the concentration in the blood of the patient, automatically produces a different GFR estimate depending on whether or not the patient is African-American. Why?I've been told it's based on an assumption that African-Americans have more muscle mass than people of other races. But what sense does it make for a doctor to automatically assume I have more muscle mass than that female bodybuilder? Wouldn't it be far more accurate and evidence-based to determine the muscle mass of individual patients just by looking at them?Well, doctors tell me they're using race as a shortcut. It's a crude but convenient proxy for more important factors, like muscle mass, enzyme level, genetic traits they just don't have time to look for. But race is a bad proxy. In many cases, race adds no relevant information at all. It's just a distraction. But race also tends to overwhelm the clinical measures. It blinds doctors to patients' symptoms, family illnesses, their history, their own illnesses they might have \u2014 all more evidence-based than the patient's race. Race can't substitute for these important clinical measures without sacrificing patient well-being.Doctors also tell me race is just one of many factors they take into account, but there are numerous medical tests, like the GFR, that use race categorically to treat black, white, Asian patients differently just because of their race.Race medicine also leaves patients of color especially vulnerable to harmful biases and stereotypes. Black and Latino patients are twice as likely to receive no pain medication as whites for the same painful long bone fractures because of stereotypes that black and brown people feel less pain, exaggerate their pain, and are predisposed to drug addiction.The Food and Drug Administration has even approved a race-specific medicine. It's a pill called BiDil to treat heart failure in self-identified African-American patients. A cardiologist developed this drug without regard to race or genetics, but it became convenient for commercial reasons to market the drug to black patients. The FDA then allowed the company, the drug company, to test the efficacy in a clinical trial that only included African-American subjects. It speculated that race stood in as a proxy for some unknown genetic factor that affects heart disease or response to drugs. But think about the dangerous message it sent, that black people's bodies are so substandard, a drug tested in them is not guaranteed to work in other patients.In the end, the drug company's marketing scheme failed. For one thing, black patients were understandably wary of using a drug just for black people. One elderly black woman stood up in a community meeting and shouted, \"Give me what the white people are taking!\"(Laughter)And if you find race-specific medicine surprising, wait until you learn that many doctors in the United States still use an updated version of a diagnostic tool that was developed by a physician during the slavery era, a diagnostic tool that is tightly linked to justifications for slavery.Dr. Samuel Cartwright graduated from the University of Pennsylvania Medical School. He practiced in the Deep South before the Civil War, and he was a well-known expert on what was then called \"Negro medicine.\" He promoted the racial concept of disease, that people of different races suffer from different diseases and experience common diseases differently. Cartwright argued in the 1850s that slavery was beneficial for black people for medical reasons. He claimed that because black people have lower lung capacity than whites, forced labor was good for them. He wrote in a medical journal, \"It is the red vital blood sent to the brain that liberates their minds when under the white man's control, and it is the want of sufficiency of red vital blood that chains their minds to ignorance and barbarism when in freedom.\" To support this theory, Cartwright helped to perfect a medical device for measuring breathing called the spirometer to show the presumed deficiency in black people's lungs.Today, doctors still uphold Cartwright's claim the black people as a race have lower lung capacity than white people. Some even use a modern day spirometer that actually has a button labeled \"race\" so the machine adjusts the measurement for each patient according to his or her race. It's a well-known function called \"correcting for race.\"The problem with race medicine extends far beyond misdiagnosing patients. Its focus on innate racial differences in disease diverts attention and resources from the social determinants that cause appalling racial gaps in health: lack of access to high-quality medical care; food deserts in poor neighborhoods; exposure to environmental toxins; high rates of incarceration; and experiencing the stress of racial discrimination.You see, race is not a biological category that naturally produces these health disparities because of genetic difference. Race is a social category that has staggering biological consequences, but because of the impact of social inequality on people's health. Yet race medicine pretends the answer to these gaps in health can be found in a race-specific pill. It's much easier and more lucrative to market a technological fix for these gaps in health than to deal with the structural inequities that produce them.The reason I'm so passionate about ending race medicine isn't just because it's bad medicine. I'm also on this mission because the way doctors practice medicine continues to promote a false and toxic view of humanity. Despite the many visionary breakthroughs in medicine we've been learning about, there's a failure of imagination when it comes to race. Would you imagine with me, just a moment: What would happen if doctors stopped treating patients by race? Suppose they rejected an 18th-century classification system and incorporated instead the most advanced knowledge of human genetic diversity and unity, that human beings cannot be categorized into biological races? What if, instead of using race as a crude proxy for some more important factor, doctors actually investigated and addressed that more important factor? What if doctors joined the forefront of a movement to end the structural inequities caused by racism, not by genetic difference?Race medicine is bad medicine, it's poor science and it's a false interpretation of humanity. It is more urgent than ever to finally abandon this backward legacy and to affirm our common humanity by ending the social inequalities that truly divide us.Thank you.(Applause)Thank you. Thanks.

--> 00:02:02.654\nThat personal experience\nwith the use of race in genetic testing\n\n00:02:02.678 --> 00:02:04.254\ngot me thinking:\n\n00:02:04.278 --> 00:02:09.998\nWhere else in medicine is race used\nto make false biological predictions?\n\n00:02:10.678 --> 00:02:16.934\nWell, I found out that race runs deeply\nthroughout all of medical practice.\n\n00:02:16.958 --> 00:02:19.973\nIt shapes physicians' diagnoses,\n\n00:02:19.997 --> 00:02:22.614\nmeasurements, treatments,\n\n00:02:22.638 --> 00:02:24.254\nprescriptions,\n\n00:02:24.278 --> 00:02:27.438\neven the very definition of diseases.\n\n00:02:28.358 --> 00:02:32.318\nAnd the more I found out,\nthe more disturbed I became.\n\n00:02:33.678 --> 00:02:36.774\nSociologists like me have long explained\n\n00:02:36.798 --> 00:02:39.694\nthat race is a social construction.\n\n00:02:39.718 --> 00:02:46.214\nWhen we identify people as black,\nwhite, Asian, Native American, Latina,\n\n00:02:46.238 --> 00:02:48.974\nwe're referring to social groupings\n\n00:02:48.998 --> 00:02:52.694\nwith made up demarcations\nthat have changed over time\n\n00:02:52.718 --> 00:02:55.254\nand vary around the world.\n\n00:02:55.278 --> 00:02:58.494\nAs a legal scholar, I've also studied\n\n00:02:58.518 --> 00:03:00.934\nhow lawmakers, not biologists,\n\n00:03:00.958 --> 00:03:04.798\nhave invented the legal\ndefinitions of races.\n\n00:03:06.598 --> 00:03:10.054\nAnd it's not just the view\nof social scientists.\n\n00:03:10.078 --> 00:03:12.694\nYou remember when the map\nof the human genome\n\n00:03:12.718 --> 00:03:16.974\nwas unveiled at a White House\nceremony in June 2000?\n\n00:03:16.998 --> 00:03:20.614\nPresident Bill Clinton famously declared,\n\n00:03:20.638 --> 00:03:22.814\n\"I believe one of the great truths\n\n00:03:22.838 --> 00:03:26.014\nto emerge from this triumphant expedition\n\n00:03:26.038 --> 00:03:27.854\ninside the human genome\n\n00:03:27.878 --> 00:03:29.734\nis that in genetic terms,\n\n00:03:29.758 --> 00:03:32.574\nhuman beings, regardless of race,\n\n00:03:32.598 --> 00:03:36.118\nare more than 99.9 percent the same.\"\n\n00:03:36.878 --> 00:03:38.454\nAnd he might have added\n\n00:03:38.478 --> 00:03:42.174\nthat that less than one percent\nof genetic difference\n\n00:03:42.198 --> 00:03:44.718\ndoesn't fall into racial boxes.\n\n00:03:45.398 --> 00:03:49.054\nFrancis Collins, who led\nthe Human Genome Project\n\n00:03:49.078 --> 00:03:50.774\nand now heads NIH,\n\n00:03:50.798 --> 00:03:52.854\nechoed President Clinton.\n\n00:03:52.878 --> 00:03:54.814\n\"I am happy that today,\n\n00:03:54.838 --> 00:03:58.678\nthe only race we're talking about\nis the human race.\"\n\n00:04:00.358 --> 00:04:04.334\nDoctors are supposed to practice\nevidence-based medicine,\n\n00:04:04.358 --> 00:04:08.294\nand they're increasingly called\nto join the genomic revolution.\n\n00:04:08.318 --> 00:04:13.198\nBut their habit of treating patients\nby race lags far behind.\n\n00:04:14.158 --> 00:04:15.374\nTake the estimate\n\n00:04:15.398 --> 00:04:18.654\nof glomerular filtration rate, or GFR.\n\n00:04:18.678 --> 00:04:22.214\nDoctors routinely interpret GFR,\n\n00:04:22.238 --> 00:04:26.478\nthis important indicator\nof kidney function, by race.\n\n00:04:27.798 --> 00:04:31.037\nAs you can see in this lab test,\n\n00:04:31.678 --> 00:04:36.854\nthe exact same creatinine level,\n\n00:04:36.878 --> 00:04:40.654\nthe concentration\nin the blood of the patient,\n\n00:04:40.678 --> 00:04:45.134\nautomatically produces\na different GFR estimate\n\n00:04:45.158 --> 00:04:49.638\ndepending on whether or not\nthe patient is African-American.\n\n00:04:51.078 --> 00:04:52.278\nWhy?\n\n00:04:53.238 --> 00:04:56.494\nI've been told it's based on an assumption\n\n00:04:56.518 --> 00:04:59.614\nthat African-Americans\nhave more muscle mass\n\n00:04:59.638 --> 00:05:01.838\nthan people of other races.\n\n00:05:02.838 --> 00:05:04.654\nBut what sense does it make\n\n00:05:04.678 --> 00:05:08.134\nfor a doctor to automatically assume\n\n00:05:08.158 --> 00:05:12.038\nI have more muscle mass\nthan that female bodybuilder?\n\n00:05:12.558 --> 00:05:16.534\nWouldn't it be far more accurate\nand evidence-based\n\n00:05:16.558 --> 00:05:20.574\nto determine the muscle mass\nof individual patients\n\n00:05:20.598 --> 00:05:22.638\njust by looking at them?\n\n00:05:24.318 --> 00:05:27.734\nWell, doctors tell me\nthey're using race as a shortcut.\n\n00:05:27.758 --> 00:05:30.494\nIt's a crude but convenient proxy\n\n00:05:30.518 --> 00:05:33.774\nfor more important factors,\nlike muscle mass,\n\n00:05:33.798 --> 00:05:36.174\nenzyme level, genetic traits\n\n00:05:36.198 --> 00:05:38.478\nthey just don't have time to look for.\n\n00:05:39.558 --> 00:05:42.334\nBut race is a bad proxy.\n\n00:05:42.358 --> 00:05:46.494\nIn many cases, race adds\nno relevant information at all.\n\n00:05:46.518 --> 00:05:48.398\nIt's just a distraction.\n\n00:05:49.558 --> 00:05:54.438\nBut race also tends to overwhelm\nthe clinical measures.\n\n00:05:55.398 --> 00:05:59.078\nIt blinds doctors to patients' symptoms,\n\n00:05:59.718 --> 00:06:01.398\nfamily illnesses,\n\n00:06:02.398 --> 00:06:06.734\ntheir history, their own illnesses\nthey might have --\n\n00:06:06.758 --> 00:06:10.278\nall more evidence-based\nthan the patient's race.\n\n00:06:11.878 --> 00:06:16.654\nRace can't substitute\nfor these important clinical measures\n\n00:06:16.678 --> 00:06:20.358\nwithout sacrificing patient well-being.\n\n00:06:21.758 --> 00:06:25.414\nDoctors also tell me\nrace is just one of many factors\n\n00:06:25.438 --> 00:06:26.974\nthey take into account,\n\n00:06:26.998 --> 00:06:29.134\nbut there are numerous medical tests,\n\n00:06:29.158 --> 00:06:30.894\nlike the GFR,\n\n00:06:30.918 --> 00:06:34.174\nthat use race categorically\n\n00:06:34.198 --> 00:06:38.174\nto treat black, white,\nAsian patients differently\n\n00:06:38.198 --> 00:06:40.278\njust because of their race.\n\n00:06:41.638 --> 00:06:47.134\nRace medicine also leaves\npatients of color especially vulnerable\n\n00:06:47.158 --> 00:06:49.958\nto harmful biases and stereotypes.\n\n00:06:50.558 --> 00:06:53.854\nBlack and Latino patients\nare twice as likely\n\n00:06:53.878 --> 00:06:57.374\nto receive no pain medication as whites\n\n00:06:57.398 --> 00:07:01.974\nfor the same painful long bone fractures\n\n00:07:01.998 --> 00:07:04.214\nbecause of stereotypes\n\n00:07:04.238 --> 00:07:08.094\nthat black and brown people\nfeel less pain,\n\n00:07:08.118 --> 00:07:10.054\nexaggerate their pain,\n\n00:07:10.078 --> 00:07:12.798\nand are predisposed to drug addiction.\n\n00:07:14.278 --> 00:07:19.934\nThe Food and Drug Administration has even\napproved a race-specific medicine.\n\n00:07:19.958 --> 00:07:22.374\nIt's a pill called BiDil\n\n00:07:22.398 --> 00:07:27.038\nto treat heart failure in self-identified\nAfrican-American patients.\n\n00:07:27.598 --> 00:07:33.774\nA cardiologist developed this drug\nwithout regard to race or genetics,\n\n00:07:33.798 --> 00:07:36.054\nbut it became convenient\n\n00:07:36.078 --> 00:07:37.974\nfor commercial reasons\n\n00:07:37.998 --> 00:07:40.718\nto market the drug to black patients.\n\n00:07:42.318 --> 00:07:44.574\nThe FDA then allowed\n\n00:07:44.598 --> 00:07:47.654\nthe company, the drug company,\n\n00:07:47.678 --> 00:07:51.294\nto test the efficacy in a clinical trial\n\n00:07:51.318 --> 00:07:55.878\nthat only included\nAfrican-American subjects.\n\n00:07:56.718 --> 00:07:58.494\nIt speculated\n\n00:07:58.518 --> 00:08:04.614\nthat race stood in as a proxy\nfor some unknown genetic factor\n\n00:08:04.638 --> 00:08:07.414\nthat affects heart disease\n\n00:08:07.438 --> 00:08:10.198\nor response to drugs.\n\n00:08:11.518 --> 00:08:14.974\nBut think about\nthe dangerous message it sent,\n\n00:08:14.998 --> 00:08:19.454\nthat black people's bodies\nare so substandard,\n\n00:08:19.478 --> 00:08:21.174\na drug tested in them\n\n00:08:21.198 --> 00:08:24.678\nis not guaranteed\nto work in other patients.\n\n00:08:26.798 --> 00:08:30.614\nIn the end, the drug company's\nmarketing scheme failed.\n\n00:08:30.638 --> 00:08:34.614\nFor one thing, black patients\nwere understandably wary\n\n00:08:34.638 --> 00:08:38.014\nof using a drug just for black people.\n\n00:08:38.038 --> 00:08:41.974\nOne elderly black woman stood up\nin a community meeting and shouted,\n\n00:08:41.998 --> 00:08:44.454\n\"Give me what the white\npeople are taking!\"\n\n00:08:44.478 --> 00:08:45.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:08:47.517 --> 00:08:51.318\nAnd if you find race-specific\nmedicine surprising,\n\n00:08:52.158 --> 00:08:54.093\nwait until you learn\n\n00:08:54.117 --> 00:08:56.934\nthat many doctors in the United States\n\n00:08:56.958 --> 00:09:00.094\nstill use an updated version\n\n00:09:00.118 --> 00:09:02.014\nof a diagnostic tool\n\n00:09:02.038 --> 00:09:06.494\nthat was developed by a physician\nduring the slavery era,\n\n00:09:06.518 --> 00:09:09.814\na diagnostic tool that is tightly linked\n\n00:09:09.838 --> 00:09:12.198\nto justifications for slavery.\n\n00:09:13.518 --> 00:09:16.174\nDr. Samuel Cartwright graduated\n\n00:09:16.198 --> 00:09:19.574\nfrom the University\nof Pennsylvania Medical School.\n\n00:09:19.598 --> 00:09:23.174\nHe practiced in the Deep South\nbefore the Civil War,\n\n00:09:23.198 --> 00:09:27.318\nand he was a well-known expert\non what was then called \"Negro medicine.\"\n\n00:09:28.078 --> 00:09:31.294\nHe promoted the racial concept of disease,\n\n00:09:31.318 --> 00:09:35.014\nthat people of different races\nsuffer from different diseases\n\n00:09:35.038 --> 00:09:38.678\nand experience\ncommon diseases differently.\n\n00:09:39.838 --> 00:09:43.094\nCartwright argued in the 1850s\n\n00:09:43.118 --> 00:09:47.134\nthat slavery was beneficial\nfor black people\n\n00:09:47.158 --> 00:09:49.214\nfor medical reasons.\n\n00:09:49.238 --> 00:09:54.134\nHe claimed that because black people\nhave lower lung capacity than whites,\n\n00:09:54.158 --> 00:09:56.718\nforced labor was good for them.\n\n00:09:57.798 --> 00:10:00.054\nHe wrote in a medical journal,\n\n00:10:00.078 --> 00:10:03.494\n\"It is the red vital blood\nsent to the brain\n\n00:10:03.518 --> 00:10:07.854\nthat liberates their minds\nwhen under the white man's control,\n\n00:10:07.878 --> 00:10:11.614\nand it is the want of sufficiency\nof red vital blood\n\n00:10:11.638 --> 00:10:16.038\nthat chains their minds to ignorance\nand barbarism when in freedom.\"\n\n00:10:17.118 --> 00:10:20.254\nTo support this theory,\nCartwright helped to perfect\n\n00:10:20.278 --> 00:10:25.118\na medical device for measuring breathing\ncalled the spirometer\n\n00:10:26.198 --> 00:10:30.238\nto show the presumed deficiency\nin black people's lungs.\n\n00:10:31.838 --> 00:10:37.374\nToday, doctors still\nuphold Cartwright's claim\n\n00:10:37.398 --> 00:10:40.014\nthe black people as a race\n\n00:10:40.038 --> 00:10:43.038\nhave lower lung capacity\nthan white people.\n\n00:10:44.238 --> 00:10:48.534\nSome even use a modern day spirometer\n\n00:10:48.558 --> 00:10:52.294\nthat actually has a button labeled \"race\"\n\n00:10:52.318 --> 00:10:54.974\nso the machine adjusts the measurement\n\n00:10:54.998 --> 00:10:58.974\nfor each patient\naccording to his or her race.\n\n00:10:58.998 --> 00:11:02.838\nIt's a well-known function\ncalled \"correcting for race.\"\n\n00:11:05.838 --> 00:11:11.318\nThe problem with race medicine\nextends far beyond misdiagnosing patients.\n\n00:11:11.878 --> 00:11:16.334\nIts focus on innate\nracial differences in disease\n\n00:11:16.358 --> 00:11:19.454\ndiverts attention and resources\n\n00:11:19.478 --> 00:11:21.694\nfrom the social determinants\n\n00:11:21.718 --> 00:11:25.694\nthat cause appalling\nracial gaps in health:\n\n00:11:25.718 --> 00:11:29.038\nlack of access\nto high-quality medical care;\n\n00:11:29.518 --> 00:11:32.358\nfood deserts in poor neighborhoods;\n\n00:11:33.118 --> 00:11:36.398\nexposure to environmental toxins;\n\n00:11:36.958 --> 00:11:39.238\nhigh rates of incarceration;\n\n00:11:39.878 --> 00:11:44.238\nand experiencing the stress\nof racial discrimination.\n\n00:11:45.078 --> 00:11:48.854\nYou see, race is not a biological category\n\n00:11:48.878 --> 00:11:52.294\nthat naturally produces\nthese health disparities\n\n00:11:52.318 --> 00:11:54.558\nbecause of genetic difference.\n\n00:11:55.198 --> 00:11:57.814\nRace is a social category\n\n00:11:57.838 --> 00:12:01.494\nthat has staggering\nbiological consequences,\n\n00:12:01.518 --> 00:12:06.438\nbut because of the impact\nof social inequality on people's health.\n\n00:12:07.118 --> 00:12:11.254\nYet race medicine pretends\nthe answer to these gaps in health\n\n00:12:11.278 --> 00:12:14.494\ncan be found in a race-specific pill.\n\n00:12:14.518 --> 00:12:17.254\nIt's much easier and more lucrative\n\n00:12:17.278 --> 00:12:20.038\nto market a technological fix\n\n00:12:20.638 --> 00:12:22.774\nfor these gaps in health\n\n00:12:22.798 --> 00:12:27.598\nthan to deal with the structural\ninequities that produce them.\n\n00:12:29.918 --> 00:12:34.254\nThe reason I'm so passionate\nabout ending race medicine\n\n00:12:34.278 --> 00:12:37.334\nisn't just because it's bad medicine.\n\n00:12:37.358 --> 00:12:39.214\nI'm also on this mission\n\n00:12:39.238 --> 00:12:42.174\nbecause the way doctors practice medicine\n\n00:12:42.198 --> 00:12:47.838\ncontinues to promote\na false and toxic view of humanity.\n\n00:12:48.798 --> 00:12:54.894\nDespite the many visionary breakthroughs\nin medicine we've been learning about,\n\n00:12:54.918 --> 00:12:57.534\nthere's a failure of imagination\n\n00:12:57.558 --> 00:12:59.278\nwhen it comes to race.\n\n00:13:00.878 --> 00:13:03.798\nWould you imagine with me, just a moment:\n\n00:13:04.558 --> 00:13:10.678\nWhat would happen if doctors\nstopped treating patients by race?\n\n00:13:12.318 --> 00:13:14.854\nSuppose they rejected\n\n00:13:14.878 --> 00:13:18.574\nan 18th-century classification system\n\n00:13:18.598 --> 00:13:22.334\nand incorporated instead\nthe most advanced knowledge\n\n00:13:22.358 --> 00:13:25.294\nof human genetic diversity and unity,\n\n00:13:25.318 --> 00:13:31.478\nthat human beings cannot be categorized\ninto biological races?\n\n00:13:32.558 --> 00:13:37.334\nWhat if, instead of using race\nas a crude proxy\n\n00:13:37.358 --> 00:13:39.734\nfor

And like most of my colleagues, I have to deal, every day, with human tragedies. I realize how your life can change from one second to the other after a major stroke or after a car accident. And what is very frustrating for us neurosurgeons is to realize that unlike other organs of the body, the brain has very little ability for self-repair. And after a major injury of your central nervous system, the patients often remain with a severe handicap. And that's probably the reason why I've chosen to be a functional neurosurgeon.What is a functional neurosurgeon? It's a doctor who is trying to improve a neurological function through different surgical strategies. You've certainly heard of one of the famous ones called deep brain stimulation, where you implant an electrode in the depths of the brain in order to modulate a circuit of neurons to improve a neurological function. It's really an amazing technology in that it has improved the destiny of patients with Parkinson's disease, with severe tremor, with severe pain. However, neuromodulation does not mean neuro-repair. And the dream of functional neurosurgeons is to repair the brain. I think that we are approaching this dream.And I would like to show you that we are very close to this. And that with a little bit of help, the brain is able to help itself.So the story started 15 years ago. At that time, I was a chief resident working days and nights in the emergency room. I often had to take care of patients with head trauma. You have to imagine that when a patient comes in with a severe head trauma, his brain is swelling and he's increasing his intracranial pressure. And in order to save his life, you have to decrease this intracranial pressure. And to do that, you sometimes have to remove a piece of swollen brain. So instead of throwing away these pieces of swollen brain, we decided with Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Brunet, who is a colleague of mine, a biologist, to study them.What do I mean by that? We wanted to grow cells from these pieces of tissue. It's not an easy task. Growing cells from a piece of tissue is a bit the same as growing very small children out from their family. So you need to find the right nutrients, the warmth, the humidity and all the nice environments to make them thrive. So that's exactly what we had to do with these cells. And after many attempts, Jean-Fran\u00e7ois did it. And that's what he saw under his microscope.And that was, for us, a major surprise. Why? Because this looks exactly the same as a stem cell culture, with large green cells surrounding small, immature cells. And you may remember from biology class that stem cells are immature cells, able to turn into any type of cell of the body. The adult brain has stem cells, but they're very rare and they're located in deep and small niches in the depths of the brain. So it was surprising to get this kind of stem cell culture from the superficial part of swollen brain we had in the operating theater.And there was another intriguing observation: Regular stem cells are very active cells \u2014 cells that divide, divide, divide very quickly. And they never die, they're immortal cells. But these cells behave differently. They divide slowly, and after a few weeks of culture, they even died. So we were in front of a strange new cell population that looked like stem cells but behaved differently.And it took us a long time to understand where they came from. They come from these cells. These blue and red cells are called doublecortin-positive cells. All of you have them in your brain. They represent four percent of your cortical brain cells. They have a very important role during the development stage. When you were fetuses, they helped your brain to fold itself. But why do they stay in your head? This, we don't know. We think that they may participate in brain repair because we find them in higher concentration close to brain lesions. But it's not so sure. But there is one clear thing \u2014 that from these cells, we got our stem cell culture. And we were in front of a potential new source of cells to repair the brain. And we had to prove this.So to prove it, we decided to design an experimental paradigm. The idea was to biopsy a piece of brain in a non-eloquent area of the brain, and then to culture the cells exactly the way Jean-Fran\u00e7ois did it in his lab. And then label them, to put color in them in order to be able to track them in the brain. And the last step was to re-implant them in the same individual. We call these autologous grafts \u2014 autografts.So the first question we had, \"What will happen if we re-implant these cells in a normal brain, and what will happen if we re-implant the same cells in a lesioned brain?\" Thanks to the help of professor Eric Rouiller, we worked with monkeys.So in the first-case scenario, we re-implanted the cells in the normal brain and what we saw is that they completely disappeared after a few weeks, as if they were taken from the brain, they go back home, the space is already busy, they are not needed there, so they disappear.In the second-case scenario, we performed the lesion, we re-implanted exactly the same cells, and in this case, the cells remained \u2014 and they became mature neurons. And that's the image of what we could observe under the microscope. Those are the cells that were re-implanted. And the proof they carry, these little spots, those are the cells that we've labeled in vitro, when they were in culture.But we could not stop here, of course. Do these cells also help a monkey to recover after a lesion? So for that, we trained monkeys to perform a manual dexterity task. They had to retrieve food pellets from a tray. They were very good at it. And when they had reached a plateau of performance, we did a lesion in the motor cortex corresponding to the hand motion. So the monkeys were plegic, they could not move their hand anymore. And exactly the same as humans would do, they spontaneously recovered to a certain extent, exactly the same as after a stroke. Patients are completely plegic, and then they try to recover due to a brain plasticity mechanism, they recover to a certain extent, exactly the same for the monkey.So when we were sure that the monkey had reached his plateau of spontaneous recovery, we implanted his own cells. So on the left side, you see the monkey that has spontaneously recovered. He's at about 40 to 50 percent of his previous performance before the lesion. He's not so accurate, not so quick. And look now when we re-implant the cells: Two months after re-implantation, the same individual.(Applause)It was also very exciting results for us, I tell you. Since that time, we've understood much more about these cells. We know that we can cryopreserve them, we can use them later on. We know that we can apply them in other neuropathological models, like Parkinson's disease, for example. But our dream is still to implant them in humans. And I really hope that I'll be able to show you soon that the human brain is giving us the tools to repair itself.Thank you.(Applause)Bruno Giussani: Jocelyne, this is amazing, and I'm sure that right now, there are several dozen people in the audience, possibly even a majority, who are thinking, \"I know somebody who can use this.\" I do, in any case. And of course the question is, what are the biggest obstacles before you can go into human clinical trials?Jocelyne Bloch: The biggest obstacles are regulations. (Laughs) So, from these exciting results, you need to fill out about two kilograms of papers and forms to be able to go through these kind of trials.BG: Which is understandable, the brain is delicate, etc.JB: Yes, it is, but it takes a long time and a lot of patience and almost a professional team to do it, you know?BG: If you project yourself \u2014 having done the research and having tried to get permission to start the trials, if you project yourself out in time, how many years before somebody gets into a hospital and this therapy is available?JB: So, it's very difficult to say. It depends, first, on the approval of the trial. Will the regulation allow us to do it soon? And then, you have to perform this kind of study in a small group of patients. So it takes, already, a long time to select the patients, do the treatment and evaluate if it's useful to do this kind of treatment. And then you have to deploy this to a multicentric trial. You have to really prove first that it's useful before offering this treatment up for everybody.BG: And safe, of course. JB: Of course.BG: Jocelyne, thank you for coming to TED and sharing this.

second-case scenario,\n\n00:07:01.740 --> 00:07:02.971\nwe performed the lesion,\n\n00:07:02.995 --> 00:07:06.135\nwe re-implanted exactly the same cells,\n\n00:07:06.159 --> 00:07:10.232\nand in this case, the cells remained --\n\n00:07:10.256 --> 00:07:13.053\nand they became mature neurons.\n\n00:07:13.782 --> 00:07:17.569\nAnd that's the image of what\nwe could observe under the microscope.\n\n00:07:17.593 --> 00:07:20.147\nThose are the cells\nthat were re-implanted.\n\n00:07:20.797 --> 00:07:22.744\nAnd the proof they carry,\n\n00:07:22.768 --> 00:07:25.945\nthese little spots, those\nare the cells that we've labeled\n\n00:07:25.969 --> 00:07:28.801\nin vitro, when they were in culture.\n\n00:07:29.713 --> 00:07:31.913\nBut we could not stop here, of course.\n\n00:07:32.479 --> 00:07:37.116\nDo these cells also help a monkey\nto recover after a lesion?\n\n00:07:37.140 --> 00:07:42.622\nSo for that, we trained monkeys\nto perform a manual dexterity task.\n\n00:07:42.646 --> 00:07:45.664\nThey had to retrieve\nfood pellets from a tray.\n\n00:07:45.688 --> 00:07:47.183\nThey were very good at it.\n\n00:07:47.854 --> 00:07:51.326\nAnd when they had reached\na plateau of performance,\n\n00:07:51.350 --> 00:07:57.645\nwe did a lesion in the motor cortex\ncorresponding to the hand motion.\n\n00:07:57.669 --> 00:07:59.526\nSo the monkeys were plegic,\n\n00:07:59.550 --> 00:08:01.462\nthey could not move their hand anymore.\n\n00:08:02.123 --> 00:08:05.677\nAnd exactly the same as humans would do,\n\n00:08:05.701 --> 00:08:08.627\nthey spontaneously recovered\nto a certain extent,\n\n00:08:08.651 --> 00:08:10.671\nexactly the same as after a stroke.\n\n00:08:10.695 --> 00:08:12.482\nPatients are completely plegic,\n\n00:08:12.506 --> 00:08:17.614\nand then they try to recover\ndue to a brain plasticity mechanism,\n\n00:08:17.638 --> 00:08:19.278\nthey recover to a certain extent,\n\n00:08:19.302 --> 00:08:21.143\nexactly the same for the monkey.\n\n00:08:21.167 --> 00:08:24.611\nSo when we were sure that the monkey\nhad reached his plateau\n\n00:08:24.635 --> 00:08:27.063\nof spontaneous recovery,\n\n00:08:27.087 --> 00:08:29.662\nwe implanted his own cells.\n\n00:08:30.245 --> 00:08:35.781\nSo on the left side, you see the monkey\nthat has spontaneously recovered.\n\n00:08:37.384 --> 00:08:42.016\nHe's at about 40 to 50 percent\nof his previous performance\n\n00:08:42.040 --> 00:08:43.252\nbefore the lesion.\n\n00:08:44.037 --> 00:08:46.807\nHe's not so accurate, not so quick.\n\n00:08:47.334 --> 00:08:50.793\nAnd look now when we re-implant the cells:\n\n00:08:50.817 --> 00:08:55.070\nTwo months after re-implantation,\nthe same individual.\n\n00:08:57.213 --> 00:09:04.131\n(Applause)\n\n00:09:04.728 --> 00:09:08.283\nIt was also very exciting results\nfor us, I tell you.\n\n00:09:09.279 --> 00:09:12.985\nSince that time, we've understood\nmuch more about these cells.\n\n00:09:13.533 --> 00:09:15.929\nWe know that we can cryopreserve them,\n\n00:09:15.953 --> 00:09:17.815\nwe can use them later on.\n\n00:09:18.172 --> 00:09:22.062\nWe know that we can apply them\nin other neuropathological models,\n\n00:09:22.086 --> 00:09:24.055\nlike Parkinson's disease, for example.\n\n00:09:24.079 --> 00:09:27.236\nBut our dream is still\nto implant them in humans.\n\n00:09:28.427 --> 00:09:32.177\nAnd I really hope that I'll be able\nto show you soon\n\n00:09:33.563 --> 00:09:38.557\nthat the human brain is giving us\nthe tools to repair itself.\n\n00:09:38.581 --> 00:09:39.901\nThank you.\n\n00:09:39.925 --> 00:09:45.911\n(Applause)\n\n00:09:45.935 --> 00:09:49.237\nBruno Giussani: Jocelyne, this is amazing,\n\n00:09:49.261 --> 00:09:53.012\nand I'm sure that right now, there are\nseveral dozen people in the audience,\n\n00:09:53.036 --> 00:09:54.242\npossibly even a majority,\n\n00:09:54.266 --> 00:09:57.014\nwho are thinking, \"I know\nsomebody who can use this.\"\n\n00:09:57.038 --> 00:09:59.298\nI do, in any case.\n\n00:09:59.322 --> 00:10:01.618\nAnd of course the question is,\n\n00:10:01.642 --> 00:10:03.720\nwhat are the biggest obstacles\n\n00:10:03.744 --> 00:10:06.535\nbefore you can go\ninto human clinical trials?\n\n00:10:07.623 --> 00:10:13.129\nJocelyne Bloch: The biggest\nobstacles are regulations. (Laughs)\n\n00:10:13.153 --> 00:10:15.915\nSo, from these exciting results,\nyou need to fill out\n\n00:10:15.939 --> 00:10:19.176\nabout two kilograms of papers and forms\n\n00:10:19.200 --> 00:10:22.248\nto be able to go through these\nkind of trials.\n\n00:10:22.272 --> 00:10:24.904\nBG: Which is understandable,\nthe brain is delicate, etc.\n\n00:10:24.928 --> 00:10:27.286\nJB: Yes, it is, but it takes a long time\n\n00:10:27.310 --> 00:10:31.341\nand a lot of patience and almost\na professional team to do it, you know?\n\n00:10:31.365 --> 00:10:33.631\nBG: If you project yourself --\n\n00:10:33.655 --> 00:10:34.870\nhaving done the research\n\n00:10:34.894 --> 00:10:38.839\nand having tried to get\npermission to start the trials,\n\n00:10:38.863 --> 00:10:42.042\nif you project yourself out in time,\n\n00:10:42.694 --> 00:10:46.392\nhow many years before\nsomebody gets into a hospital\n\n00:10:46.416 --> 00:10:48.589\nand this therapy is available?\n\n00:10:49.513 --> 00:10:51.648\nJB: So, it's very difficult to say.\n\n00:10:51.672 --> 00:10:55.606\nIt depends, first,\non the approval of the trial.\n\n00:10:55.630 --> 00:10:58.733\nWill the regulation allow us\nto do it soon?\n\n00:10:58.757 --> 00:11:01.571\nAnd then, you have to perform\nthis kind of study\n\n00:11:01.595 --> 00:11:04.395\nin a small group of patients.\n\n00:11:04.419 --> 00:11:07.344\nSo it takes, already, a long time\nto select the patients,\n\n00:11:07.368 --> 00:11:09.274\ndo the treatment\n\n00:11:09.298 --> 00:11:13.027\nand evaluate if it's useful\nto do this kind of treatment.\n\n00:11:13.051 --> 00:11:17.710\nAnd then you have to deploy\nthis to a multicentric trial.\n\n00:11:17.734 --> 00:11:21.896\nYou have to really prove\nfirst that it's useful\n\n00:11:21.920 --> 00:11:24.801\nbefore offering this treatment\nup for everybody.\n\n00:11:24.825 --> 00:11:26.714\nBG: And safe, of course. JB: Of course.\n\n00:11:26.738 --> 00:11:29.532\nBG: Jocelyne, thank you for coming\nto TED and sharing this.\n\n00:11:29.556 --> 00:11:30.707\nBG: Thank you.\n\n00:11:30.731 --> 00:11:33.402\n(Applause)"}]

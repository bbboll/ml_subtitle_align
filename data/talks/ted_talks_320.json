I feel like a fish out of water, or maybe an owl out of the air.(Laughter)I was preaching in San Jose some time ago, and my friend Mark Kvamme, who helped introduce me to this conference, brought several CEOs and leaders of some of the companies here in the Silicon Valley to have breakfast with me, or I with them. And I was so stimulated. And had such \u2014 it was an eye-opening experience to hear them talk about the world that is yet to come through technology and science. I know that we're near the end of this conference, and some of you may be wondering why they have a speaker from the field of religion. Richard can answer that, because he made that decision.But some years ago I was on an elevator in Philadelphia, coming down. I was to address a conference at a hotel. And on that elevator a man said, \"I hear Billy Graham is staying in this hotel.\" And another man looked in my direction and said, \"Yes, there he is. He's on this elevator with us.\" And this man looked me up and down for about 10 seconds, and he said, \"My, what an anticlimax!\"(Laughter)I hope that you won't feel that these few moments with me is not a \u2014 is an anticlimax, after all these tremendous talks that you've heard, and addresses, which I intend to listen to every one of them. But I was on an airplane in the east some years ago, and the man sitting across the aisle from me was the mayor of Charlotte, North Carolina. His name was John Belk. Some of you will probably know him. And there was a drunk man on there, and he got up out of his seat two or three times, and he was making everybody upset by what he was trying to do. And he was slapping the stewardess and pinching her as she went by, and everybody was upset with him. And finally, John Belk said, \"Do you know who's sitting here?\" And the man said, \"No, who?\" He said, \"It's Billy Graham, the preacher.\" He said, \"You don't say!\" And he turned to me, and he said, \"Put her there!\" He said, \"Your sermons have certainly helped me.\"(Laughter)And I suppose that that's true with thousands of people.(Laughter)I know that as you have been peering into the future, and as we've heard some of it here tonight, I would like to live in that age and see what is going to be. But I won't, because I'm 80 years old. This is my eightieth year, and I know that my time is brief. I have phlebitis at the moment, in both legs, and that's the reason that I had to have a little help in getting up here, because I have Parkinson's disease in addition to that, and some other problems that I won't talk about.(Laughter)But this is not the first time that we've had a technological revolution. We've had others. And there's one that I want to talk about. In one generation, the nation of the people of Israel had a tremendous and dramatic change that made them a great power in the Near East. A man by the name of David came to the throne, and King David became one of the great leaders of his generation. He was a man of tremendous leadership. He had the favor of God with him. He was a brilliant poet, philosopher, writer, soldier \u2014 with strategies in battle and conflict that people study even today.But about two centuries before David, the Hittites had discovered the secret of smelting and processing of iron, and, slowly, that skill spread. But they wouldn't allow the Israelis to look into it, or to have any. But David changed all of that, and he introduced the Iron Age to Israel. And the Bible says that David laid up great stores of iron, and which archaeologists have found, that in present-day Palestine, there are evidences of that generation. Now, instead of crude tools made of sticks and stones, Israel now had iron plows, and sickles, and hoes and military weapons. And in the course of one generation, Israel was completely changed. The introduction of iron, in some ways, had an impact a little bit like the microchip has had on our generation. And David found that there were many problems that technology could not solve.There were many problems still left. And they're still with us, and you haven't solved them, and I haven't heard anybody here speak to that. How do we solve these three problems that I'd like to mention? The first one that David saw was human evil. Where does it come from? How do we solve it? Over again and again in the Psalms, which Gladstone said was the greatest book in the world, David describes the evils of the human race. And yet he says, \"He restores my soul.\" Have you ever thought about what a contradiction we are? On one hand, we can probe the deepest secrets of the universe and dramatically push back the frontiers of technology, as this conference vividly demonstrates. We've seen under the sea, three miles down, or galaxies hundreds of billions of years out in the future.But on the other hand, something is wrong. Our battleships, our soldiers, are on a frontier now, almost ready to go to war with Iraq. Now, what causes this? Why do we have these wars in every generation, and in every part of the world? And revolutions? We can't get along with other people, even in our own families. We find ourselves in the paralyzing grip of self-destructive habits we can't break. Racism and injustice and violence sweep our world, bringing a tragic harvest of heartache and death. Even the most sophisticated among us seem powerless to break this cycle. I would like to see Oracle take up that, or some other technological geniuses work on this. How do we change man, so that he doesn't lie and cheat, and our newspapers are not filled with stories of fraud in business or labor or athletics or wherever?The Bible says the problem is within us, within our hearts and our souls. Our problem is that we are separated from our Creator, which we call God, and we need to have our souls restored, something only God can do. Jesus said, \"For out of the heart come evil thoughts: murders, sexual immorality, theft, false testimonies, slander.\" The British philosopher Bertrand Russell was not a religious man, but he said, \"It's in our hearts that the evil lies, and it's from our hearts that it must be plucked out.\" Albert Einstein \u2014 I was just talking to someone, when I was speaking at Princeton, and I met Mr. Einstein. He didn't have a doctor's degree, because he said nobody was qualified to give him one.(Laughter)But he made this statement. He said, \"It's easier to denature plutonium than to denature the evil spirit of man.\" And many of you, I'm sure, have thought about that and puzzled over it. You've seen people take beneficial technological advances, such as the Internet we've heard about tonight, and twist them into something corrupting. You've seen brilliant people devise computer viruses that bring down whole systems. The Oklahoma City bombing was simple technology, horribly used. The problem is not technology. The problem is the person or persons using it. King David said that he knew the depths of his own soul. He couldn't free himself from personal problems and personal evils that included murder and adultery. Yet King David sought God's forgiveness, and said, \"You can restore my soul.\"You see, the Bible teaches that we're more than a body and a mind. We are a soul. And there's something inside of us that is beyond our understanding. That's the part of us that yearns for God, or something more than we find in technology. Your soul is that part of you that yearns for meaning in life, and which seeks for something beyond this life. It's the part of you that yearns, really, for God. I find [that] young people all over the world are searching for something. They don't know what it is. I speak at many universities, and I have many questions and answer periods, and whether it's Cambridge, or Harvard, or Oxford \u2014 I've spoken at all of those universities. I'm going to Harvard in about three or four \u2014 no, it's about two months from now \u2014 to give a lecture. And I'll be asked the same questions that I was asked the last few times I've been there. And it'll be on these questions: where did I come from? Why am I here? Where am I going? What's life all about? Why am I here?Even if you have no religious belief, there are times when you wonder that there's something else. Thomas Edison also said, \"When you see everything that happens in the world of science, and in the working of the universe, you cannot deny that there's a captain on the bridge.\" I remember once, I sat beside Mrs. Gorbachev at a White House dinner. I went to Ambassador Dobrynin, whom I knew very well. And I'd been to Russia several times under the Communists, and they'd given me marvelous freedom that I didn't expect. And I knew Mr. Dobrynin very well, and I said, \"I'm going to sit beside Mrs. Gorbachev tonight. What shall I talk to her about?\" And he surprised me with the answer. He said, \"Talk to her about religion and philosophy. That's what she's really interested in.\" I was a little bit surprised, but that evening that's what we talked about, and it was a stimulating conversation. And afterward, she said, \"You know, I'm an atheist, but I know that there's something up there higher than we are.\"The second problem that King David realized he could not solve was the problem of human suffering. Writing the oldest book in the world was Job, and he said, \"Man is born unto trouble as the sparks fly upward.\" Yes, to be sure, science has done much to push back certain types of human suffering. But I'm \u2014 in a few months, I'll be 80 years of age. I admit that I'm very grateful for all the medical advances that have kept me in relatively good health all these years. My doctors at the Mayo Clinic urged me not to take this trip out here to this \u2014 to be here. I haven't given a talk in nearly four months. And when you speak as much as I do, three or four times a day, you get rusty. That's the reason I'm using this podium and using these notes. Every time you ever hear me on the television or somewhere, I'm ad-libbing. I'm not reading. I never read an address. I never read a speech or a talk or a lecture. I talk ad lib. But tonight, I've got some notes here so that if I begin to forget, which I do sometimes, I've got something I can turn to.But even here among us, most \u2014 in the most advanced society in the world, we have poverty. We have families that self-destruct, friends that betray us. Unbearable psychological pressures bear down on us. I've never met a person in the world that didn't have a problem or a worry. Why do we suffer? It's an age-old question that we haven't answered. Yet David again and again said that he would turn to God. He said, \"The Lord is my shepherd.\" The final problem that David knew he could not solve was death. Many commentators have said that death is the forbidden subject of our generation. Most people live as if they're never going to die. Technology projects the myth of control over our mortality. We see people on our screens. Marilyn Monroe is just as beautiful on the screen as she was in person, and our \u2014 many young people think she's still alive. They don't know that she's dead. Or Clark Gable, or whoever it is. The old stars, they come to life. And they're \u2014 they're just as great on that screen as they were in person. But death is inevitable.I spoke some time ago to a joint session of Congress, last year. And we were meeting in that room, the statue room. About 300 of them were there. And I said, \"There's one thing that we have in common in this room, all of us together, whether Republican or Democrat, or whoever.\" I said, \"We're all going to die. And we have that in common with all these great men of the past that are staring down at us.\" And it's often difficult for young people to understand that. It's difficult for them to understand that they're going to die. As the ancient writer of Ecclesiastes wrote, he said, there's every activity under heaven. There's a time to be born, and there's a time to die. I've stood at the deathbed of several famous people, whom you would know. I've talked to them. I've seen them in those agonizing moments when they were scared to death.And yet, a few years earlier, death never crossed their mind. I talked to a woman this past week whose father was a famous doctor. She said he never thought of God, never talked about God, didn't believe in God. He was an atheist. But she said, as he came to die, he sat up on the side of the bed one day, and he asked the nurse if he could see the chaplain. And he said, for the first time in his life he'd thought about the inevitable, and about God. Was there a God? A few years ago, a university student asked me, \"What is the greatest surprise in your life?\" And I said, \"The greatest surprise in my life is the brevity of life. It passes so fast.\" But it does not need to have to be that way. Wernher von Braun, in the aftermath of World War II concluded, quote: \"science and religion are not antagonists. On the contrary, they're sisters.\" He put it on a personal basis. I knew Dr. von Braun very well. And he said, \"Speaking for myself, I can only say that the grandeur of the cosmos serves only to confirm a belief in the certainty of a creator.\" He also said, \"In our search to know God, I've come to believe that the life of Jesus Christ should be the focus of our efforts and inspiration. The reality of this life and His resurrection is the hope of mankind.\"I've done a lot of speaking in Germany and in France, and in different parts of the world \u2014 105 countries it's been my privilege to speak in. And I was invited one day to visit Chancellor Adenauer, who was looked upon as sort of the founder of modern Germany, since the war. And he once \u2014 and he said to me, he said, \"Young man.\" He said, \"Do you believe in the resurrection of Jesus Christ?\" And I said, \"Sir, I do.\" He said, \"So do I.\" He said, \"When I leave office, I'm going to spend my time writing a book on why Jesus Christ rose again, and why it's so important to believe that.\" In one of his plays, Alexander Solzhenitsyn depicts a man dying, who says to those gathered around his bed, \"The moment when it's terrible to feel regret is when one is dying.\" How should one live in order not to feel regret when one is dying?Blaise Pascal asked exactly that question in seventeenth-century France. Pascal has been called the architect of modern civilization. He was a brilliant scientist at the frontiers of mathematics, even as a teenager. He is viewed by many as the founder of the probability theory, and a creator of the first model of a computer. And of course, you are all familiar with the computer language named for him. Pascal explored in depth our human dilemmas of evil, suffering and death. He was astounded at the phenomenon we've been considering: that people can achieve extraordinary heights in science, the arts and human enterprise, yet they also are full of anger, hypocrisy and have \u2014 and self-hatreds. Pascal saw us as a remarkable mixture of genius and self-delusion. On November 23, 1654, Pascal had a profound religious experience. He wrote in his journal these words: \"I submit myself, absolutely, to Jesus Christ, my redeemer.\"A French historian said, two centuries later, \"Seldom has so mighty an intellect submitted with such humility to the authority of Jesus Christ.\" Pascal came to believe not only the love and the grace of God could bring us back into harmony, but he believed that his own sins and failures could be forgiven, and that when he died he would go to a place called heaven. He experienced it in a way that went beyond scientific observation and reason. It was he who penned the well-known words, \"The heart has its reasons, which reason knows not of.\"Equally well known is Pascal's Wager. Essentially, he said this: \"if you bet on God, and open yourself to his love, you lose nothing, even if you're wrong. But if instead you bet that there is no God, then you can lose it all, in this life and the life to come.\" For Pascal, scientific knowledge paled beside the knowledge of God. The knowledge of God was far beyond anything that ever crossed his mind. He was ready to face him when he died at the age of 39. King David lived to be 70, a long time in his era. Yet he too had to face death, and he wrote these words: \"even though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil, for you are with me.\"This was David's answer to three dilemmas of evil, suffering and death. It can be yours, as well, as you seek the living God and allow him to fill your life and give you hope for the future. When I was 17 years of age, I was born and reared on a farm in North Carolina. I milked cows every morning, and I had to milk the same cows every evening when I came home from school. And there were 20 of them that I had \u2014 that I was responsible for, and I worked on the farm and tried to keep up with my studies. I didn't make good grades in high school. I didn't make them in college, until something happened in my heart.One day, I was faced face-to-face with Christ. He said, \"I am the way, the truth and the life.\" Can you imagine that? \"I am the truth. I'm the embodiment of all truth.\" He was a liar. Or he was insane. Or he was what he claimed to be. Which was he? I had to make that decision. I couldn't prove it. I couldn't take it to a laboratory and experiment with it. But by faith I said, I believe him, and he came into my heart and changed my life. And now I'm ready, when I hear that call, to go into the presence of God. Thank you, and God bless all of you.(Applause)Thank you for the privilege. It was great.Richard Wurman: You did it.

dramatic change\n\n00:04:50.958 --> 00:04:53.958\nthat made them a great power in the Near East.\n\n00:04:54.958 --> 00:04:56.958\nA man by the name of David\n\n00:04:56.958 --> 00:04:58.958\ncame to the throne,\n\n00:04:58.958 --> 00:05:01.958\nand King David became one of the great leaders\n\n00:05:01.958 --> 00:05:04.958\nof his generation.\n\n00:05:06.958 --> 00:05:08.958\nHe was a man of tremendous leadership.\n\n00:05:09.958 --> 00:05:12.958\nHe had the favor of God with him.\n\n00:05:12.958 --> 00:05:15.958\nHe was a brilliant poet,\n\n00:05:16.958 --> 00:05:19.958\nphilosopher, writer, soldier --\n\n00:05:20.958 --> 00:05:23.958\nwith strategies in battle and conflict\n\n00:05:23.958 --> 00:05:25.958\nthat people study even today.\n\n00:05:26.958 --> 00:05:30.958\nBut about two centuries before David,\n\n00:05:30.958 --> 00:05:32.958\nthe Hittites\n\n00:05:32.958 --> 00:05:34.958\nhad discovered the secret\n\n00:05:34.958 --> 00:05:37.958\nof smelting and processing of iron,\n\n00:05:38.958 --> 00:05:40.958\nand, slowly, that skill spread.\n\n00:05:40.958 --> 00:05:43.958\nBut they wouldn't allow the Israelis\n\n00:05:43.958 --> 00:05:46.958\nto look into it, or to have any.\n\n00:05:47.958 --> 00:05:49.958\nBut David changed all of that,\n\n00:05:49.958 --> 00:05:51.958\nand he introduced the Iron Age\n\n00:05:51.958 --> 00:05:53.958\nto Israel.\n\n00:05:53.958 --> 00:05:56.958\nAnd the Bible says that David laid up great stores of iron,\n\n00:05:57.958 --> 00:05:59.958\nand which archaeologists have found,\n\n00:05:59.958 --> 00:06:01.958\nthat in present-day Palestine,\n\n00:06:01.958 --> 00:06:04.958\nthere are evidences of that generation.\n\n00:06:05.958 --> 00:06:08.958\nNow, instead of crude tools\n\n00:06:08.958 --> 00:06:11.958\nmade of sticks and stones,\n\n00:06:11.958 --> 00:06:14.958\nIsrael now had iron plows,\n\n00:06:14.958 --> 00:06:16.958\nand sickles, and hoes\n\n00:06:16.958 --> 00:06:19.958\nand military weapons.\n\n00:06:19.958 --> 00:06:21.958\nAnd in the course of one generation,\n\n00:06:22.958 --> 00:06:25.958\nIsrael was completely changed.\n\n00:06:25.958 --> 00:06:28.958\nThe introduction of iron, in some ways,\n\n00:06:28.958 --> 00:06:31.958\nhad an impact\n\n00:06:31.958 --> 00:06:33.958\na little bit like the microchip\n\n00:06:33.958 --> 00:06:35.958\nhas had on our generation.\n\n00:06:40.958 --> 00:06:42.958\nAnd\n\n00:06:42.958 --> 00:06:44.958\nDavid found\n\n00:06:44.958 --> 00:06:47.958\nthat there were many problems that technology could not solve.\n\n00:06:48.958 --> 00:06:51.958\nThere were many problems still left.\n\n00:06:53.958 --> 00:06:56.958\nAnd they're still with us, and you haven't solved them,\n\n00:06:56.958 --> 00:06:59.958\nand I haven't heard anybody here speak to that.\n\n00:07:00.958 --> 00:07:02.958\nHow do we solve these three problems\n\n00:07:02.958 --> 00:07:04.958\nthat I'd like to mention?\n\n00:07:05.958 --> 00:07:07.958\nThe first one that David saw\n\n00:07:07.958 --> 00:07:09.958\nwas human evil.\n\n00:07:09.958 --> 00:07:12.958\nWhere does it come from?\n\n00:07:12.958 --> 00:07:14.958\nHow do we solve it?\n\n00:07:14.958 --> 00:07:16.958\nOver again and again\n\n00:07:16.958 --> 00:07:18.958\nin the Psalms,\n\n00:07:18.958 --> 00:07:21.958\nwhich Gladstone said was the greatest book in the world,\n\n00:07:23.958 --> 00:07:26.958\nDavid describes the evils of the human race.\n\n00:07:26.958 --> 00:07:28.958\nAnd yet he says,\n\n00:07:28.958 --> 00:07:31.958\n\"He restores my soul.\"\n\n00:07:31.958 --> 00:07:34.958\nHave you ever thought about what a contradiction we are?\n\n00:07:34.958 --> 00:07:38.958\nOn one hand, we can probe the deepest secrets of the universe\n\n00:07:38.958 --> 00:07:42.958\nand dramatically push back the frontiers of technology,\n\n00:07:42.958 --> 00:07:46.958\nas this conference vividly demonstrates.\n\n00:07:47.958 --> 00:07:49.958\nWe've seen under the sea,\n\n00:07:49.958 --> 00:07:51.958\nthree miles down,\n\n00:07:51.958 --> 00:07:54.958\nor galaxies hundreds of billions of years\n\n00:07:54.958 --> 00:07:56.958\nout in the future.\n\n00:07:57.958 --> 00:07:59.958\nBut on the other hand,\n\n00:08:00.958 --> 00:08:02.958\nsomething is wrong.\n\n00:08:04.958 --> 00:08:06.958\nOur battleships,\n\n00:08:06.958 --> 00:08:08.958\nour soldiers,\n\n00:08:08.958 --> 00:08:10.958\nare on a frontier now,\n\n00:08:10.958 --> 00:08:12.958\nalmost ready to go to war\n\n00:08:12.958 --> 00:08:14.958\nwith Iraq.\n\n00:08:14.958 --> 00:08:16.958\nNow, what causes this?\n\n00:08:16.958 --> 00:08:19.958\nWhy do we have these wars in every generation,\n\n00:08:19.958 --> 00:08:22.958\nand in every part of the world?\n\n00:08:22.958 --> 00:08:24.958\nAnd revolutions?\n\n00:08:25.958 --> 00:08:27.958\nWe can't get along with other people,\n\n00:08:27.958 --> 00:08:29.958\neven in our own families.\n\n00:08:29.958 --> 00:08:31.958\nWe find ourselves in the paralyzing grip\n\n00:08:31.958 --> 00:08:34.958\nof self-destructive habits we can't break.\n\n00:08:35.958 --> 00:08:38.958\nRacism and injustice and violence sweep our world,\n\n00:08:38.958 --> 00:08:42.958\nbringing a tragic harvest of heartache and death.\n\n00:08:44.958 --> 00:08:46.958\nEven the most sophisticated among us\n\n00:08:46.958 --> 00:08:49.958\nseem powerless to break this cycle.\n\n00:08:49.958 --> 00:08:51.958\nI would like to see Oracle\n\n00:08:51.958 --> 00:08:53.958\ntake up that,\n\n00:08:54.958 --> 00:08:57.958\nor\n\n00:08:57.958 --> 00:08:59.958\nsome other\n\n00:08:59.958 --> 00:09:03.958\ntechnological geniuses work on this.\n\n00:09:03.958 --> 00:09:06.958\nHow do we change man,\n\n00:09:07.958 --> 00:09:09.958\nso that he doesn't lie and cheat,\n\n00:09:09.958 --> 00:09:12.958\nand our newspapers are not filled with stories\n\n00:09:12.958 --> 00:09:14.958\nof fraud in business or labor\n\n00:09:14.958 --> 00:09:17.958\nor athletics or wherever?\n\n00:09:19.958 --> 00:09:23.958\nThe Bible says the problem is within us,\n\n00:09:23.958 --> 00:09:26.958\nwithin our hearts and our souls.\n\n00:09:26.958 --> 00:09:28.958\nOur problem is that we are separated\n\n00:09:28.958 --> 00:09:31.958\nfrom our Creator,\n\n00:09:31.958 --> 00:09:33.958\nwhich we call God,\n\n00:09:33.958 --> 00:09:35.958\nand we need to have our souls restored,\n\n00:09:38.958 --> 00:09:40.958\nsomething only God can do.\n\n00:09:40.958 --> 00:09:42.958\nJesus said, \"For out of the heart\n\n00:09:42.958 --> 00:09:44.958\ncome evil thoughts:\n\n00:09:44.958 --> 00:09:47.958\nmurders, sexual immorality,\n\n00:09:47.958 --> 00:09:50.958\ntheft, false testimonies,\n\n00:09:50.958 --> 00:09:52.958\nslander.\"\n\n00:09:52.958 --> 00:09:54.958\nThe British philosopher Bertrand Russell\n\n00:09:54.958 --> 00:09:57.958\nwas not a religious man,\n\n00:09:57.958 --> 00:10:00.958\nbut he said, \"It's in our hearts that the evil lies,\n\n00:10:00.958 --> 00:10:02.958\nand it's from our hearts\n\n00:10:02.958 --> 00:10:05.958\nthat it must be plucked out.\"\n\n00:10:05.958 --> 00:10:07.958\nAlbert Einstein --\n\n00:10:07.958 --> 00:10:10.958\nI was just talking to someone, when I was speaking at Princeton,\n\n00:10:10.958 --> 00:10:12.958\nand I met\n\n00:10:12.958 --> 00:10:14.958\nMr. Einstein.\n\n00:10:14.958 --> 00:10:16.958\nHe didn't have a doctor's degree, because he said\n\n00:10:16.958 --> 00:10:18.958\nnobody was qualified to give him one.\n\n00:10:18.958 --> 00:10:22.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:10:22.958 --> 00:10:24.958\nBut he made this statement.\n\n00:10:24.958 --> 00:10:27.958\nHe said, \"It's easier to denature plutonium\n\n00:10:27.958 --> 00:10:30.958\nthan to denature the evil spirit of man.\"\n\n00:10:30.958 --> 00:10:32.958\nAnd many of you, I'm sure,\n\n00:10:32.958 --> 00:10:34.958\nhave thought about that\n\n00:10:34.958 --> 00:10:36.958\nand puzzled over it.\n\n00:10:36.958 --> 00:10:38.958\nYou've seen people\n\n00:10:38.958 --> 00:10:41.958\ntake beneficial technological advances,\n\n00:10:41.958 --> 00:10:43.958\nsuch as the Internet we've heard about tonight,\n\n00:10:43.958 --> 00:10:47.958\nand twist them into something corrupting.\n\n00:10:47.958 --> 00:10:50.958\nYou've seen brilliant people devise computer viruses\n\n00:10:50.958 --> 00:10:53.958\nthat bring down whole systems.\n\n00:10:53.958 --> 00:10:56.958\nThe Oklahoma City bombing was simple technology,\n\n00:10:56.958 --> 00:10:58.958\nhorribly used.\n\n00:10:59.958 --> 00:11:01.958\nThe problem is not technology.\n\n00:11:01.958 --> 00:11:05.958\nThe problem is the person or persons using it.\n\n00:11:06.958 --> 00:11:08.958\nKing David said\n\n00:11:08.958 --> 00:11:11.958\nthat he knew the depths of his own soul.\n\n00:11:11.958 --> 00:11:14.958\nHe couldn't free himself from personal problems\n\n00:11:14.958 --> 00:11:17.958\nand personal evils\n\n00:11:17.958 --> 00:11:19.958\nthat included murder and adultery.\n\n00:11:20.958 --> 00:11:22.958\nYet King David sought God's forgiveness,\n\n00:11:22.958 --> 00:11:25.958\nand said, \"You can restore my soul.\"\n\n00:11:25.958 --> 00:11:28.958\nYou see, the Bible teaches\n\n00:11:28.958 --> 00:11:31.958\nthat we're more than a body and a mind.\n\n00:11:32.958 --> 00:11:35.958\nWe are a soul.\n\n00:11:35.958 --> 00:11:38.958\nAnd there's something inside of us\n\n00:11:38.958 --> 00:11:41.958\nthat is beyond our understanding.\n\n00:11:41.958 --> 00:11:44.958\nThat's the part of us that yearns\n\n00:11:44.958 --> 00:11:47.958\nfor God, or something more\n\n00:11:47.958 --> 00:11:50.958\nthan we find in technology.\n\n00:11:50.958 --> 00:11:52.958\nYour soul is that part of you that\n\n00:11:52.958 --> 00:11:54.958\nyearns for meaning in life,\n\n00:11:54.958 --> 00:11:57.958\nand which seeks for something beyond this life.\n\n00:11:57.958 --> 00:11:59.958\nIt's the part of you that yearns, really, for God.\n\n00:11:59.958 --> 00:12:01.958\nI find [that] young people all over the world\n\n00:12:01.958 --> 00:12:04.958\nare searching for something.\n\n00:12:04.958 --> 00:12:07.958\nThey don't know what it is.

extraordinary heights\n\n00:21:42.958 --> 00:21:45.958\nin science, the arts and human enterprise,\n\n00:21:45.958 --> 00:21:48.958\nyet they also are full of anger, hypocrisy\n\n00:21:48.958 --> 00:21:51.958\nand have -- and self-hatreds.\n\n00:21:52.958 --> 00:21:54.958\nPascal saw us as a remarkable mixture\n\n00:21:54.958 --> 00:21:57.958\nof genius and self-delusion.\n\n00:21:57.958 --> 00:21:59.958\nOn November 23,\n\n00:21:59.958 --> 00:22:01.958\n1654,\n\n00:22:02.958 --> 00:22:05.958\nPascal had a profound religious experience.\n\n00:22:06.958 --> 00:22:09.958\nHe wrote in his journal these words:\n\n00:22:09.958 --> 00:22:11.958\n\"I submit myself,\n\n00:22:11.958 --> 00:22:13.958\nabsolutely,\n\n00:22:14.958 --> 00:22:17.958\nto Jesus Christ, my redeemer.\"\n\n00:22:17.958 --> 00:22:19.958\nA French historian said,\n\n00:22:19.958 --> 00:22:22.958\ntwo centuries later,\n\n00:22:22.958 --> 00:22:24.958\n\"Seldom has so mighty an intellect\n\n00:22:25.958 --> 00:22:28.958\nsubmitted with such humility\n\n00:22:28.958 --> 00:22:31.958\nto the authority of Jesus Christ.\"\n\n00:22:32.958 --> 00:22:35.958\nPascal came to believe not only the love and the grace of God\n\n00:22:35.958 --> 00:22:38.958\ncould bring us back into harmony,\n\n00:22:40.958 --> 00:22:42.958\nbut he believed\n\n00:22:42.958 --> 00:22:45.958\nthat his own sins and failures could be forgiven,\n\n00:22:45.958 --> 00:22:48.958\nand that when he died he would go to a place called heaven.\n\n00:22:50.958 --> 00:22:52.958\nHe experienced it in a way that went beyond\n\n00:22:52.958 --> 00:22:54.958\nscientific observation and reason.\n\n00:22:54.958 --> 00:22:57.958\nIt was he who penned the well-known words,\n\n00:22:57.958 --> 00:22:59.958\n\"The heart has its reasons,\n\n00:23:00.958 --> 00:23:03.958\nwhich reason knows not of.\"\n\n00:23:03.958 --> 00:23:06.958\nEqually well known is Pascal's Wager.\n\n00:23:06.958 --> 00:23:09.958\nEssentially, he said this: \"if you bet on God,\n\n00:23:10.958 --> 00:23:12.958\nand open yourself to his love,\n\n00:23:12.958 --> 00:23:15.958\nyou lose nothing, even if you're wrong.\n\n00:23:15.958 --> 00:23:18.958\nBut if instead you bet that there is no God,\n\n00:23:19.958 --> 00:23:22.958\nthen you can lose it all, in this life and the life to come.\"\n\n00:23:24.958 --> 00:23:26.958\nFor Pascal, scientific knowledge\n\n00:23:26.958 --> 00:23:29.958\npaled beside the knowledge of God.\n\n00:23:30.958 --> 00:23:32.958\nThe knowledge of God was far beyond\n\n00:23:32.958 --> 00:23:35.958\nanything that ever crossed his mind.\n\n00:23:35.958 --> 00:23:37.958\nHe was ready to face him\n\n00:23:37.958 --> 00:23:40.958\nwhen he died at the age of 39.\n\n00:23:40.958 --> 00:23:42.958\nKing David lived to be 70,\n\n00:23:42.958 --> 00:23:45.958\na long time in his era.\n\n00:23:45.958 --> 00:23:48.958\nYet he too had to face death,\n\n00:23:48.958 --> 00:23:50.958\nand he wrote these words:\n\n00:23:50.958 --> 00:23:54.958\n\"even though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death,\n\n00:23:54.958 --> 00:23:56.958\nI will fear no evil,\n\n00:23:56.958 --> 00:23:58.958\nfor you are with me.\"\n\n00:23:58.958 --> 00:24:01.958\nThis was David's answer to three dilemmas\n\n00:24:01.958 --> 00:24:04.958\nof evil, suffering and death.\n\n00:24:04.958 --> 00:24:07.958\nIt can be yours, as well,\n\n00:24:08.958 --> 00:24:10.958\nas you seek the living God\n\n00:24:10.958 --> 00:24:12.958\nand allow him to fill your life\n\n00:24:12.958 --> 00:24:15.958\nand give you hope for the future.\n\n00:24:17.958 --> 00:24:19.958\nWhen I was 17 years of age,\n\n00:24:21.958 --> 00:24:24.958\nI was born and reared on a farm in North Carolina.\n\n00:24:25.958 --> 00:24:27.958\nI milked cows every morning, and I had to milk the same cows every evening\n\n00:24:27.958 --> 00:24:29.958\nwhen I came home from school.\n\n00:24:29.958 --> 00:24:31.958\nAnd there were 20 of them that I had --\n\n00:24:31.958 --> 00:24:34.958\nthat I was responsible for,\n\n00:24:34.958 --> 00:24:37.958\nand I worked on the farm\n\n00:24:37.958 --> 00:24:40.958\nand tried to keep up with my studies.\n\n00:24:40.958 --> 00:24:43.958\nI didn't make good grades in high school.\n\n00:24:43.958 --> 00:24:46.958\nI didn't make them in college, until\n\n00:24:46.958 --> 00:24:48.958\nsomething happened in my heart.\n\n00:24:48.958 --> 00:24:51.958\nOne day, I was faced face-to-face\n\n00:24:52.958 --> 00:24:54.958\nwith Christ.\n\n00:24:54.958 --> 00:24:57.958\nHe said, \"I am the way, the truth and the life.\"\n\n00:24:58.958 --> 00:25:01.958\nCan you imagine that? \"I am the truth.\n\n00:25:01.958 --> 00:25:04.958\nI'm the embodiment of all truth.\"\n\n00:25:04.958 --> 00:25:06.958\nHe was a liar.\n\n00:25:08.958 --> 00:25:10.958\nOr he was insane.\n\n00:25:11.958 --> 00:25:13.958\nOr he was what he claimed to be.\n\n00:25:13.958 --> 00:25:15.958\nWhich was he?\n\n00:25:15.958 --> 00:25:17.958\nI had to make that decision.\n\n00:25:17.958 --> 00:25:19.958\nI couldn't prove it.\n\n00:25:19.958 --> 00:25:21.958\nI couldn't take it to a laboratory\n\n00:25:21.958 --> 00:25:23.958\nand experiment with it.\n\n00:25:23.958 --> 00:25:26.958\nBut by faith I said, I believe him,\n\n00:25:27.958 --> 00:25:30.958\nand he came into my heart\n\n00:25:30.958 --> 00:25:32.958\nand changed my life.\n\n00:25:32.958 --> 00:25:35.958\nAnd now I'm ready,\n\n00:25:35.958 --> 00:25:37.958\nwhen I hear that call,\n\n00:25:37.958 --> 00:25:40.958\nto go into the presence of God.\n\n00:25:40.958 --> 00:25:42.958\nThank you, and God bless all of you.\n\n00:25:42.958 --> 00:25:52.958\n(Applause)\n\n00:25:53.958 --> 00:25:55.958\nThank you for the privilege. It was great.\n\n00:25:55.958 --> 00:25:57.958\nRichard Wurman: You did it.\n\n00:25:57.958 --> 00:25:58.958\nThanks.\n\n00:25:59.958 --> 00:26:14.958\n(Applause)"}, {"title": "My year of living biblically", "duration": "1060", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/a_j_jacobs_year_of_living_biblically", "transcript": "I thought I'd tell you a little about what I like to write. And I like to immerse myself in my topics. I just like to dive right in and become sort of a human guinea pig. And I see my life as a series of experiments.So, I work for Esquire magazine, and a couple of years ago, I wrote an article called \"My Outsourced Life,\" where I hired a team of people in Bangalore, India, to live my life for me. So, they answered my emails. They answered my phone. They argued with my wife for me, and they read my son bedtime stories. It was the best month of my life, because I just sat back and I read books and watched movies. It was a wonderful experience.More recently, I wrote an article for Esquire called \u2014 about radical honesty. And this is a movement where \u2014 this is started by a psychologist in Virginia, who says that you should never, ever lie, except maybe during poker and golf, his only exceptions. And, more than that, whatever is on your brain should come out of your mouth. So, I decided I would try this for a month. This was the worst month of my life. (Laughter) I do not recommend this at all. To give you a sense of the experience, the article was called, \"I Think You're Fat.\" (Laughter) So, that was hard.My most recent book \u2014 my previous book was called \"The Know-It-All,\" and it was about the year I spent reading the Encyclopedia Britannica from A to Z in my quest to learn everything in the world, or more precisely from Aak, which is a type of East Asian music, all the way to Zwyiec, which is \u2014 well, I don't want to ruin the ending. (Laughter) It's a very exciting twist ending, like an O. Henry novel, so I won't ruin it. But I love that one, because that was an experiment about how much information one human brain could absorb. Although, listening to Kevin Kelly, you don't have to remember anything. You can just Google it. So, I wasted some time there.I love those experiments, but I think that the most profound and life-changing experiment that I've done is my most recent experiment, where I spent a year trying to follow all of the rules of the Bible, \"The Year of Living Biblically.\" And I undertook this for two reasons. The first was that I grew up with no religion at all. As I say in my book, I'm Jewish in the same way the Olive Garden is Italian. (Laughter) So, not very. But I've become increasingly interested in religion. I do think it's the defining issue of our time, or one of the main ones. And I have a son. I want to know what to teach him. So, I decided to dive in head first, and try to live the Bible.The second reason I undertook this is because I'm concerned about the rise of fundamentalism, religious fundamentalism, and people who say they take the Bible literally, which is, according to some polls, as high as 45 or 50 percent of America. So I decided, what if you really did take the Bible literally? I decided to take it to its logical conclusion and take everything in the Bible literally, without picking and choosing.The first thing I did was I got a stack of bibles. I had Christian bibles. I had Jewish bibles. A friend of mine sent me something called a hip-hop bible, where the twenty-third Psalm is rendered as, \"The Lord is all that,\" as opposed to what I knew it as, \"The Lord is my shepherd.\"Then I went down and I read several versions, and I wrote down every single law that I could find. And this was a very long list \u2014 over 700 rules. And they range from the famous ones that I had heard of \u2014 The Ten Commandments, love your neighbor, be fruitful and multiply. So I wanted to follow those. And actually, I take my projects very seriously, because I had twins during my year, so I definitely take my projects seriously.But I also wanted to follow the hundreds of arcane and obscure laws that are in the Bible. There is the law in Leviticus, \"You cannot shave the corners of your beard.\" I didn't know where my corners were, so I decided to let the whole thing grow, and this is what I looked like by the end. As you can imagine, I spent a lot of time at airport security. (Laughter) My wife wouldn't kiss me for the last two months. So, certainly the challenge was there.The Bible says you cannot wear clothes made of mixed fibers, so I thought, \"Sounds strange, but I'll try it.\" You only know if you try it. I got rid of all my poly-cotton T-shirts. The Bible says that if two men are in a fight, and the wife of one of those men grabs the testicles of the other man, then her hand shall be cut off. So, I wanted to follow that rule. (Laughter) That one I followed by default, by not getting in a fight with a man whose wife was standing nearby, looking like she had a strong grip. (Laughter) So \u2014 oh, there's another shot of my beard.I will say it was an amazing year because it really was life changing, and incredibly challenging. And there were two types of laws that were particularly challenging. The first was avoiding the little sins that we all commit every day. You know, I could spend a year not killing, but spending a year not gossiping, not coveting, not lying \u2014 you know, I live in New York, and I work as a journalist, so this was 75, 80 percent of my day I had to do it.But it was really interesting, because I was able to make some progress, because I couldn't believe how much my behavior changed my thoughts. This was one of the huge lessons of the year, is that I almost pretended to be a better person, and I became a little bit of a better person. So I had always thought, you know, \"You change your mind, and you change your behavior,\" but it's often the other way around. You change your behavior, and you change your mind. So, you know, if you want to become more compassionate, you visit sick people in the hospital, and you will become more compassionate. You donate money to a cause, and you become emotionally involved in that cause. So, it really was cognitive psychology \u2014 you know, cognitive dissonance \u2014 that I was experiencing. The Bible actually talks about cognitive psychology, very primitive cognitive psychology. In the Proverbs, it says that if you smile, you will become happier, which, as we know, is actually true.The second type of rule that was difficult to obey was the rules that will get you into a little trouble in twenty-first-century America. And perhaps the clearest example of this is stoning adulterers. (Laughter) But it's a big part of the Bible, so I figured I had to address it. So, I was able to stone one adulterer. It happened \u2014 I was in the park, and I was dressed in my biblical clothing, so sandals and sort of a white robe, you know, because again, the outer affects the inner. I wanted to see how dressing biblically affected my mind. And this man came up to me and he said, \"Why are you dressed like that?\" And I explained my project, and he said, \"Well, I am an adulterer, are you going to stone me?\" And I said, \"Well, that would be great!\" (Laughter) And I actually took out a handful of stones from my pocket that I had been carrying around for weeks, hoping for just this interaction \u2014 and, you know, they were pebbles \u2014 but he grabbed them out of my hand. He was actually an elderly man, mid-70s, just so you know. But he's still an adulterer, and still quite angry. He grabbed them out of my hand and threw them at my face, and I felt that I could \u2014 eye for an eye \u2014 I could retaliate, and throw one back at him.So that was my experience stoning, and it did allow me to talk about, in a more serious way, these big issues. How can the Bible be so barbaric in some places, and yet so incredibly wise in others? How should we view the Bible? Should we view it, you know, as original intent, like a sort of a Scalia version of the Bible? How was the Bible written? And actually, since this is a tech crowd, I talk in the book about how the Bible actually reminds me of the Wikipedia, because it has all of these authors and editors over hundreds of years. And it's sort of evolved. It's not a book that was written and came down from on high.So I thought I would end by telling you just a couple of the take-aways, the bigger lessons that I learned from my year. The first is, thou shalt not take the Bible literally. This became very, very clear, early on. Because if you do, then you end up acting like a crazy person, and stoning adulterers, or \u2014 here's another example. Well, that's another. I did spend some time shepherding. (Laughter) It's a very relaxing vocation. I recommend it.But this one is \u2014 the Bible says that you cannot touch women during certain times of the month, and more than that, you cannot sit on a seat where a menstruating woman has sat. And my wife thought this was very offensive, so she sat in every seat in our apartment, and I had to spend much of the year standing until I bought my own seat and carried it around.So, you know, I met with creationists. I went to the creationists' museum. And these are the ultimate literalists. And it was fascinating, because they were not stupid people at all. I would wager that their IQ is exactly the same as the average evolutionist. It's just that their faith is so strong in this literal interpretation of the Bible that they distort all the data to fit their model. And they go through these amazing mental gymnastics to accomplish this.And I will say, though, the museum is gorgeous. They really did a fantastic job. If you're ever in Kentucky, there's, you can see a movie of the flood, and they have sprinklers in the ceiling that will sprinkle on you during the flood scenes. So, whatever you think of creationism \u2014 and I think it's crazy \u2014 they did a great job. (Laughter)Another lesson is that thou shalt give thanks. And this one was a big lesson because I was praying, giving these prayers of thanksgiving, which was odd for an agnostic. But I was saying thanks all the time, every day, and I started to change my perspective. And I started to realize the hundreds of little things that go right every day, that I didn't even notice, that I took for granted, as opposed to focusing on the three or four that went wrong. So, this is actually a key to happiness for me, is to just remember when I came over here, the car didn't flip over, and I didn't trip coming up the stairs. It's a remarkable thing.Third, that thou shall have reverence. This one was unexpected because I started the year as an agnostic, and by the end of the year, I became what a friend of mine calls a reverent agnostic, which I love. And I'm trying to start it as a movement. So, if anyone wants to join, the basic idea is, whether or not there is a God, there's something important and beautiful about the idea of sacredness, and that our rituals can be sacred. The Sabbath can be sacred. This was one of the great things about my year, doing the Sabbath, because I am a workaholic, so having this one day where you cannot work, it really, that changed my life. So, this idea of sacredness, whether or not there is a God.Thou shall not stereotype. This one happened because I spent a lot of time with various religious communities throughout America because I wanted it to be more than about my journey. I wanted it to be about religion in America. So, I spent time with evangelical Christians, and Hasidic Jews, and the Amish. I'm very proud because I think I'm the only person in America to out Bible-talk a Jehovah's Witness. (Laughter) After three and a half hours, he looked at his watch, he's like, \"I gotta go.\" (Laughter) Oh, thank you very much. Thank you. Bless you, bless you.But it was interesting because I had some very preconceived notions about, for instance, evangelical Christianity, and I found that it's such a wide and varied movement that it is difficult to make generalizations about it. There's a group I met with called the Red Letter Christians, and they focus on the red words in the Bible, which are the ones that Jesus spoke. That's how they printed them in the old Bibles. And their argument is that Jesus never talked about homosexuality. They have a pamphlet that says, \"Here's what Jesus said about homosexuality,\" and you open it up, and there's nothing in it. So, they say Jesus did talk a lot about helping the outcasts, helping poor people. So, this was very inspiring to me. I recommend Jim Wallis and Tony Campolo. They're very inspiring leaders, even though I disagree with much of what they say.Also, thou shalt not disregard the irrational. This one was very unexpected because, you know, I grew up with the scientific worldview, and I was shocked learning how much of my life is governed by irrational forces. And the thing is, if they're not harmful, they're not to be completely dismissed. Because I learned that \u2014 I was thinking, I was doing all these rituals, these biblical rituals, separating my wool and linen, and I would ask these religious people \"Why would the Bible possibly tell us to do this? Why would God care?\" And they said, \"We don't know, but it's just rituals that give us meaning.\" And I would say, \"But that's crazy.\" And they would say, \"Well, what about you? You blow out candles on top of a birthday cake. If a guy from Mars came down and saw, here's one guy blowing out the fire on top of a cake versus another guy not wearing clothes of mixed fabrics, would the Martians say, 'Well, that guy, he makes sense, but that guy's crazy?'\" So no, I think that rituals are, by nature, irrational. So the key is to choose the right rituals, the ones that are not harmful \u2014 but rituals by themselves are not to be dismissed.And finally I learned that thou shall pick and choose. And this one I learned because I tried to follow everything in the Bible. And I failed miserably. Because you can't. You have to pick and choose. And anyone who follows the Bible is going to be picking and choosing. The key is to pick and choose the right parts. There's the phrase called cafeteria religion, and the fundamentalists will use it in a denigrating way, and they'll say, \"Oh, it's just cafeteria religion. You're just picking and choosing.\" But my argument is, \"What's wrong with cafeterias?\" I've had some great meals at cafeterias. I've also had some meals that make me want to dry heave. So, it's about choosing the parts of the Bible about compassion, about tolerance, about loving your neighbor, as opposed to the parts about homosexuality is a sin, or intolerance, or violence, which are very much in the Bible as well. So if we are to find any meaning in this book, then we have to really engage it, and wrestle with it.And I thought I'd end with just a couple more. There's me reading the Bible. That's how I hailed taxicabs. (Laughter) Seriously, and it worked. And yes, that was actually a rented sheep, so I had to return that in the morning, but it served well for a day. So, anyway, thank you so much for letting me speak.", "id": 301, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:11.958 --> 00:00:15.958\nI thought I'd tell you a little about what I like to write.\n\n00:00:15.958 --> 00:00:19.958\nAnd I like to immerse myself in my topics.\n\n00:00:19.958 --> 00:00:24.958\nI just like to dive right in and become sort of a human guinea pig.\n\n00:00:24.958 --> 00:00:29.958\nAnd I see my life as a series of experiments.\n\n00:00:29.958 --> 00:00:33.958\nSo, I work for Esquire magazine, and a couple of years ago,\n\n00:00:33.958 --> 00:00:36.958\nI wrote an article called \"My Outsourced Life,\"\n\n00:00:36.958 --> 00:00:40.958\nwhere I hired a team of people in Bangalore, India,\n\n00:00:40.958 --> 00:00:42.958\nto live my life for me.\n\n00:00:42.958 --> 00:00:44.958\nSo, they answered my emails.\n\n00:00:44.958 --> 00:00:46.958\nThey answered my phone.\n\n00:00:46.958 --> 00:00:53.958\nThey argued with my wife for me, and they read my son bedtime stories.\n\n00:00:53.958 --> 00:00:55.958\nIt was the best month of my life,\n\n00:00:55.958 --> 00:01:00.958\nbecause I just sat back and I read books and watched movies.\n\n00:01:00.958 --> 00:01:02.958\nIt was a wonderful experience.\n\n00:01:02.958 --> 00:01:05.958\nMore recently, I wrote an article for Esquire called --\n\n00:01:05.958 --> 00:01:08.958\nabout radical honesty.\n\n00:01:08.958 --> 00:01:10.958\nAnd this is a movement where --\n\n00:01:10.958 --> 00:01:14.958\nthis is started by a psychologist in Virginia,\n\n00:01:14.958 --> 00:01:17.958\nwho says that you should never, ever lie,\n\n00:01:17.958 --> 00:01:22.958\nexcept maybe during poker and golf, his only exceptions.\n\n00:01:22.958 --> 00:01:24.958\nAnd, more than that, whatever is on your brain\n\n00:01:24.958 --> 00:01:26.958\nshould come out of your mouth.\n\n00:01:26.958 --> 00:01:29.958\nSo, I decided I would try this for a month.\n\n00:01:29.958 --> 00:01:32.958\nThis was the worst month of my life.\n\n00:01:32.958 --> 00:01:33.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:01:33.958 --> 00:01:35.958\nI do not recommend this at all.\n\n00:01:35.958 --> 00:01:37.958\nTo give you a sense of the experience,\n\n00:01:37.958 --> 00:01:41.958\nthe article was called, \"I Think You're Fat.\"\n\n00:01:41.958 --> 00:01:43.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:01:43.958 --> 00:01:44.958\nSo, that was hard.\n\n00:01:45.958 --> 00:01:49.958\nMy most recent book -- my previous book was called \"The Know-It-All,\"\n\n00:01:50.958 --> 00:01:54.958\nand it was about the year I spent reading the Encyclopedia Britannica\n\n00:01:54.958 --> 00:01:57.958\nfrom A to Z in my quest to learn everything in the world,\n\n00:01:58.958 --> 00:02:03.958\nor more precisely from Aak, which is a type of East Asian music,\n\n00:02:03.958 --> 00:02:07.958\nall the way to Zwyiec, which is -- well, I don't want to ruin the ending.\n\n00:02:07.958 --> 00:02:08.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:02:08.958 --> 00:02:12.958\nIt's a very exciting twist ending, like an O. Henry novel, so I won't ruin it.\n\n00:02:12.958 --> 00:02:14.958\nBut I love that one,\n\n00:02:14.958 --> 00:02:18.958\nbecause that was an experiment about how much information\n\n00:02:18.958 --> 00:02:20.958\none human brain could absorb.\n\n00:02:20.958 --> 00:02:24.958\nAlthough, listening to Kevin Kelly, you don't have to remember anything.\n\n00:02:24.958 --> 00:02:26.958\nYou can just Google it.\n\n00:02:26.958 --> 00:02:28.958\nSo, I wasted some time there.\n\n00:02:28.958 --> 00:02:31.958\nI love those experiments,\n\n00:02:31.958 --> 00:02:33.958\nbut I think that the most profound\n\n00:02:33.958 --> 00:02:37.958\nand life-changing experiment that I've done\n\n00:02:37.958 --> 00:02:41.958\nis my most recent experiment, where I spent a year\n\n00:02:41.958 --> 00:02:44.958\ntrying to follow all of the rules of the Bible,\n\n00:02:44.958 --> 00:02:46.958\n\"The Year of Living Biblically.\"\n\n00:02:47.958 --> 00:02:50.958\nAnd I undertook this for two reasons.\n\n00:02:50.958 --> 00:02:54.958\nThe first was that I grew up with no religion at all.\n\n00:02:54.958 --> 00:02:58.958\nAs I say in my book, I'm Jewish in the same way\n\n00:02:58.958 --> 00:03:00.958\nthe Olive Garden is Italian.\n\n00:03:00.958 --> 00:03:02.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:03:02.958 --> 00:03:04.958\nSo, not very.\n\n00:03:04.958 --> 00:03:07.958\nBut I've become increasingly interested in religion.\n\n00:03:07.958 --> 00:03:09.958\nI do think it's the defining issue of our time,\n\n00:03:09.958 --> 00:03:11.958\nor one of the main ones.\n\n00:03:11.958 --> 00:03:14.958\nAnd I have a son. I want to know what to teach him.\n\n00:03:14.958 --> 00:03:18.958\nSo, I decided to dive in head first, and try to live the Bible.\n\n00:03:19.958 --> 00:03:22.958\nThe second reason I undertook this is because\n\n00:03:22.958 --> 00:03:25.958\nI'm concerned about the rise of fundamentalism,\n\n00:03:25.958 --> 00:03:28.958\nreligious fundamentalism, and people who say\n\n00:03:28.958 --> 00:03:31.958\nthey take the Bible literally, which is, according to some polls,\n\n00:03:31.958 --> 00:03:34.958\nas high as 45 or 50 percent of America.\n\n00:03:35.958 --> 00:03:39.958\nSo I decided, what if you really did take the Bible literally?\n\n00:03:39.958 --> 00:03:43.958\nI decided to take it to its logical conclusion\n\n00:03:43.958 --> 00:03:45.958\nand take everything in the Bible literally,\n\n00:03:45.958 --> 00:03:48.958\nwithout picking and choosing.\n\n00:03:48.958 --> 00:03:51.958\nThe first thing I did was I got a stack of bibles.\n\n00:03:51.958 --> 00:03:53.958\nI had Christian bibles.\n\n00:03:53.958 --> 00:03:55.958\nI had Jewish bibles.\n\n00:03:55.958 --> 00:03:58.958\nA friend of mine sent me something called a hip-hop bible,\n\n00:03:58.958 --> 00:04:02.958\nwhere the twenty-third Psalm is rendered as, \"The Lord is all that,\"\n\n00:04:02.958 --> 00:04:06.958\nas opposed to what I knew it as, \"The Lord is my shepherd.\"\n\n00:04:06.958 --> 00:04:10.958\nThen I went down and I read several versions,\n\n00:04:10.958 --> 00:04:13.958\nand I wrote down every single law that I could find.\n\n00:04:13.958 --> 00:04:17.958\nAnd this was a very long list -- over 700 rules.\n\n00:04:18.958 --> 00:04:21.958\nAnd they range from the famous ones that I had heard of --\n\n00:04:21.958 --> 00:04:24.958\nThe Ten Commandments, love your neighbor, be fruitful and multiply.\n\n00:04:24.958 --> 00:04:26.958\nSo I wanted to follow those.\n\n00:04:26.958 --> 00:04:29.958\nAnd actually, I take my projects very seriously,\n\n00:04:29.958 --> 00:04:31.958\nbecause I had twins during my year,\n\n00:04:31.958 --> 00:04:34.958\nso I definitely take my projects seriously.\n\n00:04:34.958 --> 00:04:37.958\nBut I also wanted to follow the hundreds\n\n00:04:37.958 --> 00:04:40.958\nof arcane and obscure laws that are in the Bible.\n\n00:04:40.958 --> 00:04:42.958\nThere is the law in Leviticus,\n\n00:04:42.958 --> 00:04:44.958\n\"You cannot shave the corners of your beard.\"\n\n00:04:44.958 --> 00:04:46.958\nI didn't know where my corners were,\n\n00:04:46.958 --> 00:04:49.958\nso I decided to let the whole thing grow,\n\n00:04:49.958 --> 00:04:51.958\nand this is what I looked like by the end.\n\n00:04:52.958 --> 00:04:56.958\nAs you can imagine, I spent a lot of time at airport security.\n\n00:04:56.958 --> 00:04:58.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:04:58.958 --> 00:05:01.958\nMy wife wouldn't kiss me for the last two months.\n\n00:05:01.958 --> 00:05:03.958\nSo, certainly the challenge was there.\n\n00:05:03.958 --> 00:05:08.958\nThe Bible says you cannot wear clothes made of mixed fibers,\n\n00:05:08.958 --> 00:05:10.958\nso I thought, \"Sounds strange, but I'll try it.\"\n\n00:05:10.958 --> 00:05:12.958\nYou only know if you try it.\n\n00:05:12.958 --> 00:05:15.958\nI got rid of all my poly-cotton T-shirts.\n\n00:05:15.958 --> 00:05:19.958\nThe Bible says that if two men are in a fight,\n\n00:05:19.958 --> 00:05:25.958\nand the wife of one of those men grabs the testicles of the other man,\n\n00:05:25.958 --> 00:05:27.958\nthen her hand shall be cut off.\n\n00:05:27.958 --> 00:05:29.958\nSo, I wanted to follow that rule.\n\n00:05:29.958 --> 00:05:30.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:05:30.958 --> 00:05:33.958\nThat one I followed by default,\n\n00:05:33.958 --> 00:05:37.958\nby not getting in a fight with a man whose wife was standing nearby,\n\n00:05:37.958 --> 00:05:39.958\nlooking like she had a strong grip.\n\n00:05:40.958 --> 00:05:42.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:05:43.958 --> 00:05:46.958\nSo -- oh, there's another shot of my beard.\n\n00:05:47.958 --> 00:05:49.958\nI will say it was an amazing year\n\n00:05:49.958 --> 00:05:52.958\nbecause it really was life changing, and incredibly challenging.\n\n00:05:52.958 --> 00:05:55.958\nAnd there were two types of laws that were particularly challenging.\n\n00:05:55.958 --> 00:05:59.958\nThe first was avoiding the little sins that we all commit every day.\n\n00:05:59.958 --> 00:06:01.958\nYou know, I could spend a year not killing,\n\n00:06:01.958 --> 00:06:06.958\nbut spending a year not gossiping, not coveting, not lying --\n\n00:06:06.958 --> 00:06:09.958\nyou know, I live in New York, and I work as a journalist,\n\n00:06:09.958 --> 00:06:14.958\nso this was 75, 80 percent of my day I had to do it.\n\n00:06:14.958 --> 00:06:19.958\nBut it was really interesting, because I was able to make some progress,\n\n00:06:19.958 --> 00:06:21.958\nbecause I couldn't believe how much\n\n00:06:21.958 --> 00:06:24.958\nmy behavior changed my thoughts.\n\n00:06:24.958 --> 00:06:26.958\nThis was one of the huge lessons of the year,\n\n00:06:26.958 --> 00:06:29.958\nis that I almost pretended to be a better person,\n\n00:06:29.958 --> 00:06:32.958\nand I became a little bit of a better person.\n\n00:06:32.958 --> 00:06:37.958\nSo I had always thought, you know, \"You change your mind,\n\n00:06:37.958 --> 00:06:40.958\nand you change your behavior,\" but it's often the other way around.\n\n00:06:40.958 --> 00:06:45.958\nYou change your behavior, and you change your mind.\n\n00:06:45.958 --> 00:06:48.958\nSo, you know, if you want to become more compassionate,\n\n00:06:48.958 --> 00:06:50.958\nyou visit sick people in the hospital,\n\n00:06:50.958 --> 00:06:52.958\nand you will become more compassionate.\n\n00:06:52.958 --> 00:06:54.958\nYou donate money to a cause,\n\n00:06:54.958 --> 00:06:57.958\nand you become emotionally involved in that cause.\n\n00:06:57.958 --> 00:06:59.958\nSo, it really was cognitive psychology --\n\n00:07:00.958 --> 00:07:03.958\nyou know, cognitive dissonance -- that I was experiencing.\n\n00:07:03.958 --> 00:07:06.958\nThe Bible actually talks about cognitive psychology,\n\n00:07:06.958 --> 00:07:08.958\nvery primitive cognitive psychology.\n\n00:07:08.958 --> 00:07:12.958\nIn the Proverbs, it says that if you smile, you will become happier,\n\n00:07:12.958 --> 00:07:15.958\nwhich, as we know, is actually true.\n\n00:07:15.958 --> 00:07:19.958\nThe second type of rule that was difficult to obey\n\n00:07:19.958 --> 00:07:22.958\nwas the rules that will get you into a little trouble\n\n00:07:22.958 --> 00:07:24.958\nin twenty-first-century America.\n\n00:07:25.958 --> 00:07:30.958\nAnd perhaps the clearest example of this is stoning adulterers.\n\n00:07:30.958 --> 00:07:31.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:07:31.958 --> 00:07:35.958\nBut it's a big part of the Bible,\n\n00:07:35.958 --> 00:07:37.958\nso I figured I had to address it.\n\n00:07:38.958 --> 00:07:40.958\nSo, I was able to stone one adulterer.\n\n00:07:40.958 --> 00:07:45.958\nIt happened -- I was in the park, and I was dressed in my biblical clothing,\n\n00:07:45.958 --> 00:07:48.958\nso sandals and sort of a white robe,\n\n00:07:48.958 --> 00:07:50.958\nyou know, because again, the outer affects the inner.\n\n00:07:50.958 --> 00:07:53.958\nI wanted to see how dressing biblically affected my mind.\n\n00:07:54.958 --> 00:07:56.958\nAnd this man came up to me and he said,\n\n00:07:56.958 --> 00:07:58.958\n\"Why are you dressed like that?\"\n\n00:07:58.958 --> 00:08:00.958\nAnd I explained my project,\n\n00:08:00.958 --> 00:08:03.958\nand he said, \"Well, I am an adulterer, are you going to stone me?\"\n\n00:08:03.958 --> 00:08:06.958\nAnd I said, \"Well, that would be great!\"\n\n00:08:06.958 --> 00:08:10.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:08:11.958 --> 00:08:16.958\nAnd I actually took out a handful of stones from my pocket\n\n00:08:16.958 --> 00:08:18.958\nthat I had been carrying around for weeks,\n\n00:08:18.958 --> 00:08:22.958\nhoping for just this interaction -- and, you know, they were pebbles --\n\n00:08:22.958 --> 00:08:25.958\nbut he grabbed them out of my hand.\n\n00:08:25.958 --> 00:08:28.958\nHe was actually an elderly man, mid-70s, just so you know.\n\n00:08:28.958 --> 00:08:30.958\nBut he's still an adulterer, and still quite angry.\n\n00:08:30.958 --> 00:08:32.958\nHe grabbed them out of my hand\n\n00:08:32.958 --> 00:08:35.958\nand threw them at my face, and I felt that I could --\n\n00:08:35.958 --> 00:08:39.958\neye for an eye -- I could retaliate, and throw one back at him.\n\n00:08:39.958 --> 00:08:42.958\nSo that was my experience stoning, and it did allow me\n\n00:08:42.958 --> 00:08:47.958\nto talk about, in a more serious way, these big issues.\n\n00:08:47.958 --> 00:08:51.958\nHow can the Bible be so barbaric in some places,\n\n00:08:51.958 --> 00:08:53.958\nand yet so incredibly wise in others?\n\n00:08:54.958 --> 00:08:56.958\nHow should we view the Bible?\n\n00:08:56.958 --> 00:08:58.958\nShould we view it, you know, as original intent,\n\n00:08:58.958 --> 00:09:02.958\nlike a sort of a Scalia version of the Bible?\n\n00:09:03.958 --> 00:09:05.958\nHow was the Bible written?\n\n00:09:05.958 --> 00:09:07.958\nAnd actually, since this is a tech crowd,\n\n00:09:07.958 --> 00:09:11.958\nI talk in the book about how the Bible actually reminds me\n\n00:09:11.958 --> 00:09:14.958\nof the Wikipedia, because it has all of these authors and editors\n\n00:09:14.958 --> 00:09:16.958\nover hundreds of years.\n\n00:09:16.958 --> 00:09:18.958\nAnd it's sort of evolved.\n\n00:09:18.958 --> 00:09:21.958\nIt's not a book that was written and came down from on high.\n\n00:09:23.958 --> 00:09:27.958\nSo I thought I would end by telling you\n\n00:09:27.958 --> 00:09:30.958\njust a couple of the take-aways, the bigger lessons\n\n00:09:30.958 --> 00:09:32.958\nthat I learned from my year.\n\n00:09:33.958 --> 00:09:37.958\nThe first is, thou shalt not take the Bible literally.\n\n00:09:37.958 --> 00:09:40.958\nThis became very, very clear, early on.\n\n00:09:40.958 --> 00:09:43.958\nBecause if you do, then you end up acting like a crazy person,\n\n00:09:43.958 --> 00:09:46.958\nand stoning adulterers, or -- here's another example.\n\n00:09:46.958 --> 00:09:51.958\nWell, that's another. I did spend some time shepherding.\n\n00:09:51.958 --> 00:09:52.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:09:52.958 --> 00:09:55.958\nIt's a very relaxing vocation. I recommend it.\n\n00:09:56.958 --> 00:10:00.958\nBut this one is -- the Bible says that you cannot touch women\n\n00:10:00.958 --> 00:10:03.958\nduring certain times of the month, and more than that,\n\n00:10:03.958 --> 00:10:06.958\nyou cannot sit on a seat where a menstruating woman has sat.\n\n00:10:07.958 --> 00:10:09.958\nAnd my wife thought this was very offensive,\n\n00:10:09.958 --> 00:10:11.958\nso she sat in every seat in our apartment,\n\n00:10:11.958 --> 00:10:14.958\nand I had to spend much of the year standing\n\n00:10:14.958 --> 00:10:20.958\nuntil I bought my own seat and carried it around.\n\n00:10:20.958 --> 00:10:24.958\nSo, you know, I met with creationists.\n\n00:10:24.958 --> 00:10:26.958\nI went to the creationists' museum.\n\n00:10:26.958 --> 00:10:28.958\nAnd these are the ultimate literalists.\n\n00:10:28.958 --> 00:10:31.958\nAnd it was fascinating, because they were not stupid people at all.\n\n00:10:31.958 --> 00:10:34.958\nI would wager that their IQ is exactly the same as the average evolutionist.\n\n00:10:34.958 --> 00:10:37.958\nIt's just that their faith is so strong\n\n00:10:37.958 --> 00:10:39.958\nin this literal interpretation of the Bible\n\n00:10:39.958 --> 00:10:43.958\nthat they distort all the data to fit their model.\n\n00:10:44.958 --> 00:10:48.958\nAnd they go through these amazing mental gymnastics to accomplish this.\n\n00:10:48.958 --> 00:10:53.958\nAnd I will say, though, the museum is gorgeous.\n\n00:10:53.958 --> 00:10:55.958\nThey really did a fantastic job.\n\n00:10:55.958 --> 00:10:56.958\nIf you're ever in Kentucky,\n\n00:10:56.958 --> 00:10:59.958\nthere's, you can see a movie of the flood,\n\n00:10:59.958 --> 00:11:01.958\nand they have sprinklers in the ceiling\n\n00:11:01.958 --> 00:11:05.958\nthat will sprinkle on you during the flood scenes.\n\n00:11:05.958 --> 00:11:08.958\nSo, whatever you think of creationism -- and I think it's crazy --\n\n00:11:08.958 --> 00:11:10.958\nthey did a great job.\n\n00:11:11.958 --> 00:11:13.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:11:13.958 --> 00:11:17.958\nAnother lesson is that thou shalt give thanks.\n\n00:11:17.958 --> 00:11:21.958\nAnd this one was a big lesson because I was praying,\n\n00:11:21.958 --> 00:11:25.958\ngiving these prayers of thanksgiving, which was odd for an agnostic.\n\n00:11:25.958 --> 00:11:29.958\nBut I was saying thanks all the time, every day,\n\n00:11:29.958 --> 00:11:32.958\nand I started to change my perspective.\n\n00:11:32.958 --> 00:11:35.958\nAnd I started to realize the hundreds of little things\n\n00:11:35.958 --> 00:11:39.958\nthat go right every day, that I didn't even notice,\n\n00:11:39.958 --> 00:11:41.958\nthat I took for granted, as opposed to focusing\n\n00:11:41.958 --> 00:11:44.958\non the three or four that went wrong.\n\n00:11:45.958 --> 00:11:47.958\nSo, this is actually a key to happiness for me,\n\n00:11:48.958 --> 00:11:50.958\nis to just remember when I came over here,\n\n00:11:50.958 --> 00:11:54.958\nthe car didn't flip over, and I didn't trip coming up the stairs.\n\n00:11:54.958 --> 00:11:56.958\nIt's a remarkable thing.\n\n00:11:58.958 --> 00:12:00.958\nThird, that thou shall have reverence.\n\n00:12:00.958 --> 00:12:03.958\nThis one was unexpected because I started the year\n\n00:12:03.958 --> 00:12:05.958\nas an agnostic, and by the end of the year,\n\n00:12:05.958 --> 00:12:10.958\nI became what a friend of mine calls a reverent agnostic, which I love.\n\n00:12:10.958 --> 00:12:12.958\nAnd I'm trying to start it as a movement.\n\n00:12:12.958 --> 00:12:14.958\nSo, if anyone wants to join,\n\n00:12:14.958 --> 00:12:17.958\nthe basic idea is, whether or not there is a God,\n\n00:12:17.958 --> 00:12:21.958\nthere's something important and beautiful about the idea of sacredness,\n\n00:12:21.958 --> 00:12:23.958\nand that our rituals can be sacred.\n\n00:12:23.958 --> 00:12:26.958\nThe Sabbath can be sacred.\n\n00:12:26.958 --> 00:12:29.958\nThis was one of the great things about my year, doing the Sabbath,\n\n00:12:29.958 --> 00:12:33.958\nbecause I am a workaholic, so having this one day\n\n00:12:33.958 --> 00:12:36.958\nwhere you cannot work, it really, that changed my life.\n\n00:12:37.958 --> 00:12:41.958\nSo, this idea of sacredness, whether or not there is a God.\n\n00:12:42.958 --> 00:12:44.958\nThou shall not stereotype.\n\n00:12:44.958 --> 00:12:46.958\nThis one happened because\n\n00:12:46.958 --> 00:12:49.958\nI spent a lot of time with various religious communities\n\n00:12:49.958 --> 00:12:51.958\nthroughout America because I wanted it to be more\n\n00:12:51.958 --> 00:12:53.958\nthan about my journey.\n\n00:12:53.958 --> 00:12:56.958\nI wanted it to be about religion in America.\n\n00:12:56.958 --> 00:13:00.958\nSo, I spent time with evangelical Christians, and Hasidic Jews, and the Amish.\n\n00:13:00.958 --> 00:13:02.958\nI'm very proud because\n\n00:13:02.958 --> 00:13:04.958\nI think I'm the only person in America\n\n00:13:04.958 --> 00:13:07.958\nto out Bible-talk a Jehovah's Witness.\n\n00:13:07.958 --> 00:13:08.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:13:08.958 --> 00:13:11.958\nAfter three and a half hours, he looked at his watch,\n\n00:13:11.958 --> 00:13:13.958\nhe's like, \"I gotta go.\"\n\n00:13:13.958 --> 00:13:15.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:13:15.958 --> 00:13:16.958\nOh, thank you very much.\n\n00:13:20.958 --> 00:13:21.958\nThank you. Bless you, bless you.\n\n00:13:22.958 --> 00:13:24.958\nBut it was interesting\n\n00:13:24.958 --> 00:13:27.958\nbecause I had some very preconceived notions about, for instance,\n\n00:13:27.958 --> 00:13:31.958\nevangelical Christianity, and I found that\n\n00:13:31.958 --> 00:13:33.958\nit's such a wide and varied movement\n\n00:13:33.958 --> 00:13:38.958\nthat it is difficult to make generalizations about it.\n\n00:13:39.958 --> 00:13:42.958\nThere's a group I met with called the Red Letter Christians,\n\n00:13:42.958 --> 00:13:45.958\nand they focus on the red words in the Bible,\n\n00:13:45.958 --> 00:13:47.958\nwhich are the ones that Jesus spoke.\n\n00:13:47.958 --> 00:13:49.958\nThat's how they printed them in the old Bibles.\n\n00:13:49.958 --> 00:13:54.958\nAnd their argument is that Jesus never talked about homosexuality.\n\n00:13:54.958 --> 00:13:56.958\nThey have a pamphlet that says,\n\n00:13:56.958 --> 00:13:58.958\n\"Here's what Jesus said about homosexuality,\"\n\n00:13:58.958 --> 00:14:00.958\nand you open it up, and there's nothing in it.\n\n00:14:01.958 --> 00:14:07.958\nSo, they say Jesus did talk a lot about helping the outcasts,\n\n00:14:07.958 --> 00:14:10.958\nhelping poor people.\n\n00:14:10.958 --> 00:14:13.958\nSo, this was very inspiring to me.\n\n00:14:14.958 --> 00:14:18.958\nI recommend Jim Wallis and Tony Campolo.\n\n00:14:19.958 --> 00:14:23.958\nThey're very inspiring leaders, even though I disagree\n\n00:14:23.958 --> 00:14:25.958\nwith much of what they say.\n\n00:14:25.958 --> 00:14:28.958\nAlso, thou shalt not disregard the irrational.\n\n00:14:28.958 --> 00:14:32.958\nThis one was very unexpected because, you know,\n\n00:14:32.958 --> 00:14:35.958\nI grew up with the scientific worldview,\n\n00:14:35.958 --> 00:14:42.958\nand I was shocked learning how much of my life\n\n00:14:42.958 --> 00:14:45.958\nis governed by irrational forces.\n\n00:14:45.958 --> 00:14:48.958\nAnd the thing is, if they're not harmful,\n\n00:14:49.958 --> 00:14:51.958\nthey're not to be completely dismissed.\n\n00:14:51.958 --> 00:14:55.958\nBecause I learned that -- I was thinking, I was\n\n00:14:55.958 --> 00:14:58.958\ndoing all these rituals, these biblical rituals,\n\n00:14:58.958 --> 00:15:01.958\nseparating my wool and linen, and I would ask these religious people\n\n00:15:02.958 --> 00:15:06.958\n\"Why would the Bible possibly tell us to do this? Why would God care?\"\n\n00:15:06.958 --> 00:15:08.958\nAnd they said, \"We don't know,\n\n00:15:08.958 --> 00:15:12.958\nbut it's just rituals that give us meaning.\"\n\n00:15:12.958 --> 00:15:14.958\nAnd I would say, \"But that's crazy.\"\n\n00:15:14.958 --> 00:15:16.958\nAnd they would say, \"Well, what about you?\n\n00:15:16.958 --> 00:15:20.958\nYou blow out candles on top of a birthday cake.\n\n00:15:21.958 --> 00:15:25.958\nIf a guy from Mars came down and saw, here's one guy\n\n00:15:25.958 --> 00:15:29.958\nblowing out the fire on top of a cake\n\n00:15:29.958 --> 00:15:33.958\nversus another guy not wearing clothes of mixed fabrics,\n\n00:15:33.958 --> 00:15:37.958\nwould the Martians say, 'Well, that guy, he makes sense,\n\n00:15:37.958 --> 00:15:39.958\nbut that guy's crazy?'\"\n\n00:15:39.958 --> 00:15:44.958\nSo no, I think that rituals are, by nature, irrational.\n\n00:15:44.958 --> 00:15:47.958\nSo the key is to choose the right rituals,\n\n00:15:47.958 --> 00:15:53.958\nthe ones that are not harmful -- but rituals by themselves\n\n00:15:53.958 --> 00:15:55.958\nare not to be dismissed.\n\n00:15:56.958 --> 00:16:00.958\nAnd finally I learned that thou shall pick and choose.\n\n00:16:00.958 --> 00:16:02.958\nAnd this one I learned because\n\n00:16:02.958 --> 00:16:04.958\nI tried to follow everything in the Bible.\n\n00:16:04.958 --> 00:16:06.958\nAnd I failed miserably.\n\n00:16:06.958 --> 00:16:08.958\nBecause you can't.\n\n00:16:08.958 --> 00:16:11.958\nYou have to pick and choose. And anyone who follows the Bible\n\n00:16:11.958 --> 00:16:13.958\nis going to be picking and choosing.\n\n00:16:13.958 --> 00:16:18.958\nThe key is to pick and choose the right parts.\n\n00:16:18.958 --> 00:16:22.958\nThere's the phrase called cafeteria religion,\n\n00:16:22.958 --> 00:16:26.958\nand the fundamentalists will use it in a denigrating way,\n\n00:16:26.958 --> 00:16:28.958\nand they'll say, \"Oh, it's just cafeteria religion.\n\n00:16:28.958 --> 00:16:29.958\nYou're just picking and choosing.\"\n\n00:16:29.958 --> 00:16:33.958\nBut my argument is, \"What's wrong with cafeterias?\"\n\n00:16:33.958 --> 00:16:35.958\nI've had some great meals at cafeterias.\n\n00:16:35.958 --> 00:16:39.958\nI've also had some meals that make me want to dry heave.\n\n00:16:39.958 --> 00:16:42.958\nSo, it's about choosing the parts of the Bible about compassion,\n\n00:16:43.958 --> 00:16:45.958\nabout tolerance, about loving your neighbor,\n\n00:16:46.958 --> 00:16:51.958\nas opposed to the parts about homosexuality is a sin,\n\n00:16:51.958 --> 00:16:53.958\nor intolerance, or violence,\n\n00:16:53.958 --> 00:16:55.958\nwhich are very much in the Bible as well.\n\n00:16:55.958 --> 00:16:59.958\nSo if we are to find any meaning in this book,\n\n00:16:59.958 --> 00:17:03.958\nthen we have to really engage it, and wrestle with it.\n\n00:17:03.958 --> 00:17:06.958\nAnd I thought I'd end with just a couple more.\n\n00:17:06.958 --> 00:17:08.958\nThere's me reading the Bible.\n\n00:17:08.958 --> 00:17:10.958\nThat's how I hailed taxicabs.\n\n00:17:10.958 --> 00:17:13.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:17:13.958 --> 00:17:15.958\nSeriously, and it worked. And yes,\n\n00:17:15.958 --> 00:17:18.958\nthat was actually a rented sheep,\n\n00:17:18.958 --> 00:17:22.958\nso I had to return that in the morning, but it served well for a day.\n\n00:17:23.958 --> 00:17:26.958\nSo, anyway, thank you so much for letting me speak."}, {"title": "Brain magic", "duration": "1189", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/keith_barry_does_brain_magic", "transcript": "Brain magic. What's brain magic all about? Brain magic to me indicates that area of magic dealing with psychological and mind-reading effects. So unlike traditional magic, it uses the power of words, linguistic deception, non-verbal communication and various other techniques to create the illusion of a sixth sense.I'm going to show you all how easy it is to manipulate the human mind once you know how. I want everybody downstairs also to join in with me and everybody. I want everybody to put out your hands like this for me, first of all. OK, clap them together, once. OK, reverse your hands. Now, follow my actions exactly. Now about half the audience has their left hand up. Why is that? OK, swap them around, put your right hand up. Cross your hands over, so your right hand goes over, interlace your fingers like this, then make sure your right thumb is outside your left thumb \u2014 that's very important. Yours is the other way around, so swap it around. Excellent, OK. Extend your fingers like this for me. All right. Tap them together once. OK, now, if you did not allow me to deceive your minds, you would all be able to do this.(Laughter)(Laughter ends)Now you can see how easy it is for me to manipulate the human mind, once you know how.(Laughter)Now, I remember when I was about 15,(Laughter)I read a copy of Life magazine, which detailed a story about a 75-year-old blind Russian woman who could sense printed letters \u2014 there's still people trying to do it \u2014(Laughter)\u2014 who could sense printed letters and even sense colors, just by touch. And she was completely blind. She could also read the serial numbers on bills when they were placed, face down, on a hard surface. Now, I was fascinated, but at the same time, skeptical. How could somebody read using their fingertips? You know, if you actually think about it, if somebody is totally blind \u2014 a guy yesterday did a demonstration in one of the rooms, where people had to close their eyes and they could just hear things. And it's just a really weird thing to try and figure out. How could somebody read using their fingertips?Now earlier on, as part of a TV show that I have coming up on MTV, I attempted to give a similar demonstration of what is now known as second sight. So, let's take a look.(Video) Man: There we go. I'm going to guide you into the car.Kathryn Thomas: (Laughter)Man: You're OK, keep on going.KT: How are you?Keith Barry: Kathryn, it's Keith here. I'm going to take you to a secret location, OK? Kathryn, there was no way you could see through that blindfold.KT: OK, but don't say my name like that. KB: But you're OK?KT: Yes.KB: No way to see through it? KT: No.KB: I'll take it off. Do you want to take the rest off? Take it off, you're OK. We'll stop for a second.KT: I'm so afraid of what I'm going to see.KB: You're fine, take it off. You're OK. You're safe. Have you ever heard of second sight?KT: No.KB: Second sight is whereby a mind-control expert can see through somebody else's eyes. And I'm going to try that right now.KT: God.KB: Are you ready? Where is it? There's no way \u2014KT: (Beep)KT: Oh, my God!KB: Don't say anything, I'm trying to see through your eyes. I can't see.KT: There's a wall, there's a wall.KB: Look at the road, look at the road.KT: OK, OK, OK. Oh, my God!KB: Now, anything coming at all? KT: No.KB: Sure there's not?KT: No, no, I'm just still looking at the road. I'm looking at the road, all the time. I'm not taking my eyes off the road.(Beep)(Beep)(Beep)KT: Oh, my God!KB: Where are we? Where are we? We're going uphill, are we going uphill?KT: Look at the road \u2014 (Beep) Still got that goddamn blindfold on.KB: What?KT: How are you doing this?KB: Just don't break my concentration.We're OK, though? KT: Yes. That's so weird. We're nearly there. Oh, my God!Oh, my God!KB: And I've stopped.KT: That is weird. You're like a freak-ass of nature. That was the most scary thing I've ever done in my life!(Applause)KB: Thank you. By the way, two days ago, we were going to film this down there, at the race course, and we got a guy into a car, and we got a camera man in the back, but halfway through the drive, he told me he had, I think it was a nine-millimeter, stuck to his leg. So, I stopped pretty quick, and that was it.So, do you believe it's possible to see through somebody else's eyes? That's the question. Now, most people here would automatically say no. OK, but I want you to realize some facts. I couldn't see through the blindfold. The car was not gimmicked or tricked in any way. The girl, I'd never met before, all right. So, I want you to just think about it for a moment. A lot of people try to come up with a logical solution to what just happened, all right. But because your brains are not trained in the art of deception, the solutions you come up with will, 99 percent of the time, be way off the mark.This is because magic is all about directing attention. If, for instance, I didn't want you to look at my right hand, then I don't look at it. But if I wanted you to look at my right hand, then I look at it, too. You see, it's very simple, once you know how, but very complicated in other ways.I'm going to give you some demonstrations right now. I need two people to help me out real quick. Can you come up? And let's see, down at the end, here, can you also come up, real quick? Do you mind? Yes, at the end. OK, give them a round of applause as they come up. You might want to use the stairs, there.(Applause)It's very important for everybody here to realize I haven't set anything up with you. You don't know what will happen, right? Would you mind just standing over here for a moment?Your name is? Nicole: Nicole.KB: Nicole, and?(Telephone ringing)KB: Actually, here's the thing, answer it, answer it, answer it.(Laughter)Is it a girl? Man: They've already gone.KB: OK, swap over positions. Can you stand over here? This will make it easier. Pity, I would have told them it was the ace of spades. OK, a little bit closer.(Laughter)OK, a little bit closer, come over \u2014 they look really nervous up here. Do you believe in witchcraft?Nicole: No.KB: Voodoo? Nicole: No.KB: Things that go bump in the night? Nicole: No.KB: Besides, who's next, no, OK. I want you to just stand exactly like this for me, pull up your sleeves, if you don't mind. OK, now, I want you to be aware of all the different sensations around you, because we'll try a voodoo experiment. I want you to be aware of the sensations, but don't say anything until I ask you, and don't open your eyes until I ask you. From this point onwards, close your eyes, do not say anything, do not open them, be aware of the sensations.Yes or no, did you feel anything?Nicole: Yes.KB: You did feel that? What did you feel?Nicole: A touch on my back.KB: How many times did you feel it?Nicole: Twice.KB: Twice. OK, extend your left arm out in front of you. Extend your left arm, OK. OK, keep it there. Be aware of the sensations, don't say anything, don't open your eyes, OK.Did you feel anything, there?Nicole: Yes. KB: What did you feel?Nicole: Three \u2014KB: Like a tickling sensation? Nicole: Yes.KB: Can you show us where? OK, excellent. Open your eyes. I never touched you. I just touched his back, and I just touched his arm. A voodoo experiment.(Laughter)Yeah, I walk around nightclubs all night like this.(Laughter)You just take a seat over here for a second. I'm going to use you again, in a moment. Can you take a seat right over here, if you don't mind.Sit right here. Man: OK.KB: OK, take a seat. Excellent, OK. Now, what I want you to do is look directly at me, OK, just take a deep breath in through your nose, letting it out through your mouth, and relax. Allow your eyes to close, on five, four, three, two, one. Close your eyes right now. OK, now, I'm not hypnotizing you, I'm merely placing you in a heightened state of synchronicity, so our minds are along the same lines. And as you sink and drift and float into this relaxed state of mind, I'm going to take your left hand, and just place it up here.I want you to hold it there just for a moment, and I only want you to allow your hand to sink and drift and float back to the tabletop at the same rate and speed as you drift and float into this relaxed state of awareness, and allow it to go all the way down to the tabletop. That's it, all the way down, all the way down. and further, and further. Excellent. I want you to allow your hand to stick firmly to the tabletop. OK, now, allow it to stay there.OK, now, in a moment, you'll feel a certain pressure, OK, and I want you to be aware of the pressure. Just be aware of the pressure. And I only want you to allow your hand to float slowly back up from the tabletop as you feel the pressure release, but only when you feel the pressure release. Do you understand? Just answer yes or no.Man: Yes.KB: Hold it right there. And only when you feel the pressure go back, allow your hand to drift back to the tabletop, but only when you feel the pressure.(Laughter)OK, that was wonderfully done. Let's try it again.Excellent. Now that you've got the idea, let's try something even more interesting. Allow it to stick firmly to the tabletop, keep your eyes closed. Can you stand up? Just stand, stage forward. I want you to point directly at his forehead. OK. Imagine a connection between you and him. Only when you want the pressure to be released, make an upward gesture, like this, but only when you want it to be released. You can wait as long as you want, but only when you want the pressure released. OK, let's try it again. OK, now, imagine the connection, OK. Point directly at his forehead. Only when you want the pressure released, we'll try it again.OK, it worked that time, excellent. And hold it there, both of you. Only when you want the pressure to go back, make a downward gesture. You can wait as long as you want. You did it pretty quickly, but it went down, OK.Now, I want you to be aware that in a moment, when I snap my fingers, your eyes will open, again. It's OK to remember to forget, or forget to remember what happened. Most people ask you, \"What the hell just happened up here?\" But it's OK that even though you're not hypnotized, you will forget everything that happened. On five, four, three, two, one \u2014 open your eyes, wide awake. Give them a round of applause, as they go back to their seats.(Applause)OK, you can go back.(Applause)I once saw a film called \"The Gods Are Crazy.\" Has anybody here seen that film? Yeah. Remember when they threw the Coke out of the airplane, and it landed on the ground, and it didn't break? Now, see, that's because Coke bottles are solid. It's nearly impossible to break a Coke bottle. Do you want to try it? Good job. She's not taking any chances.(Laughter)You see, psychokinesis is the paranormal influence of the mind on physical events and processes. For some magicians or mentalists, sometimes the spoon will bend or melt, sometimes it will not. Sometimes the object will slide across the table, sometimes it will not. It depends on how much energy you have that day, so on and so forth.We're going to try an experiment in psychokinesis, right now. Come right over here, next to me. Excellent. Now, have a look at the Coke bottle. Make sure it is solid, there's only one hole, and it's a normal Coke bottle. And you can whack it against the table, if you want; be careful. Even though it's solid, I'm standing away. I want you to pinch right here with two fingers and your thumb. Excellent. Now, I've got a shard of glass here, OK. I want you to examine the shard of glass. Careful, it's sharp. Just hold on to it for a moment. Now, hold it out here.I want you to imagine, right now, a broken relationship from many years ago. I want you to imagine all the negative energy from that broken relationship, from that guy, being imparted into the broken piece of glass, which will represent him, OK. But I want you to take this very seriously. Stare at the glass, ignore everybody right here. In a moment, you'll feel a certain sensation, OK, and when you feel that sensation, I want you to drop the piece of glass into the bottle. Think of that guy, that ba \u2014 that guy.(Laughter)I'm trying to be good here. OK, and when you feel the sensation \u2014 it might take a while \u2014 drop it into the glass. OK, drop it in.Now, imagine all that negative energy in there. Imagine his name and imagine him inside the glass. And I want you to release that negative energy by shaking it from side to side.(Burst)(Laughter)That was a lot of negative energy, built up in there.(Laughter)(Applause)I also want you to look at me and think of his name. OK, think of how many letters in the title of his name. There's five letters in the title. You didn't react to that, so it's four letters. Think of one of the letters in the title. There's a K in his name, there is a K. I knew that because my name starts with a K also, but his name doesn't start with a K, it starts with an M. Tell Mike I said hello, the next time you see him.Was that his name? Nicole: Mm-hmm.KB: OK, give her a round of applause.(Applause)Thank you.(Applause)(Applause ends)I've got one more thing to share with you right now. Actually, Chris, I was going to pick you for this, but instead of picking you, can you hop up here and pick a victim for this next experiment? And it should be a male victim, that's the only thing.Chris Anderson: Oh, OK.KB: I was going to use you, but I decided I might want to come back another year.(Laughter)CA: Well, to reward him for saying \"eureka,\" and for selecting Michael Mercil to come and talk to us \u2014 Steve Jurvetson.KB: OK, Steve, come on up here.(Applause)CA: You knew!KB: OK, Steve, I want you to take a seat, right behind here. Excellent. Now, Steve \u2014 oh, you can check underneath. Go ahead, I've no fancy assistants underneath there. They insist that because I was a magician, put a nice, black tablecloth on. There you are, OK.(Laughter)I've got four wooden plinths here, Steve. One, two, three and four. Now, they're all the exact same except this one obviously has a stainless steel spike sticking out of it. I want you to examine it, and make sure it's solid. Happy?Steve Jurvetson: Mmm, yes.KB: OK. Now, Steve, I'm going to stand in front of the table, When I stand in front of the table, I want you to put the cups on the plinths, in any order you want, and then mix them all up, so nobody has any idea where the spike is, all right?SJ: No one in the audience?KB: Yes, and just to help you out, I'll block them from view, so nobody can see what you're doing. I'll also look away. So, go ahead and mix them up, now. OK, and tell me when you're done.(Laughter)(Laughter)KB: You done? SJ: Almost.KB: Almost, oh. OK, you're making sure that's well hidden. Oh, we've got one here, we've got one here.(Applause)So, all right, we'll leave them like that.(Laughter)I'm going to have the last laugh, though.(Laughter)Now, Steve, you know where the spike is, but nobody else, does? Correct? But I don't want you to know either, so swivel around on your chair. They'll keep an eye on me to make sure I don't do anything funny. No, stay around, OK. Now, Steve, look back. Now you don't know where the spike is, and I don't know where it is either. Now, is there any way to see through this blindfold?SJ: Put this on?KB: No, just, is there any way to see through it? No?SJ: No, I can't see through it. KB: Excellent. Now, I'm going to put on the blindfold. Don't stack them up, OK. Give them an extra mix up. Don't move the cups, I don't want anybody to see where the spike is, but give the plinths an extra mix up, and then line them up. I'll put the blindfold on. Give them an extra mix up. No messing around this time. OK, go ahead, mix them up. My hand is at risk here.(Laughter)Tell me when you're done. SJ: Done.KB: OK, where are you? Put out your hand. Your right hand. Tell me when I'm over a cup.SJ: You're over a cup. KB: I'm over a cup, right now?SJ: Mm-hmm.KB: Now, Steve, do you think it's here? Yes or no?SJ: Oh!(Laughter)KB: I told you I'd have the last laugh.(Laughter)SJ: I don't think it's there. KB: No? Good decision.(Laughter)(Applause)(Applause ends)Now, if I go this way, is there another cup over here?SJ: Can we do the left hand?KB: Oh, no, no, no. He asked me could he do the left hand. Absolutely not.(Laughter)KB: If I go this way, is there another cup?SJ: Yes. KB: Tell me when to stop.SJ: OK. KB: There?SJ: Yes, there's one.KB: OK. Do you think it's here, yes or no? This is your decision, not mine.(Laughter)SJ: I'm going to say no. KB: Good decision.(Laughter)OK, give me both hands. Now, put them on both cups. Do you think the spike is under your left or your right hand?SJ: Neither.KB: Neither, oh, OK. But if you were to guess.(Laughter)SJ: Under my right hand. KB: Under your right hand? Now, remember, you made all the decisions all along. Psychologists, figure this out.(SJ gasps)Have a look.SJ: Oh!(Applause)KB: Thank you.(Applause ends) If anybody wants to see some sleight of hand later on, I'll be outside. Thank you.(Applause)Thank you.Thank you.(Applause)", "id": 310, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:11.958 --> 00:00:13.958\nBrain magic.

And an encounter I had with CNN summarizes what I'm going to be talking about today, which is the eleventh reason to be optimistic. The editor of Discover told us 10 of them; I'm going to give you the eleventh.So they came to me, CNN, and they said, \"Professor Seligman \u2014 would you tell us about the state of psychology today? We'd like to interview you about that.\" And I said, \"Great.\" And she said, \"But this is CNN, so you only get a sound bite.\" I said, \"Well, how many words do I get?\" And she said, \"Well, one.\"(Laughter)And the cameras rolled, and she said, \"Professor Seligman, what is the state of psychology today?\" \"Good.\"(Laughter)\"Cut! Cut. That won't do. We'd really better give you a longer sound bite.\" \"How many words do I get this time?\" \"Well, you get two.\"(Laughter)\"Doctor Seligman, what is the state of psychology today?\" \"Not good.\"(Laughter)\"Look, Doctor Seligman, we can see you're really not comfortable in this medium. We'd better give you a real sound bite. This time you can have three words. Professor Seligman, what is the state of psychology today?\" \"Not good enough.\" That's what I'm going to be talking about.I want to say why psychology was good, why it was not good, and how it may become, in the next 10 years, good enough. And by parallel summary, I want to say the same thing about technology, about entertainment and design, because I think the issues are very similar.So, why was psychology good? Well, for more than 60 years, psychology worked within the disease model. Ten years ago, when I was on an airplane and I introduced myself to my seatmate, and told them what I did, they'd move away from me, because, quite rightly, they were saying psychology is about finding what's wrong with you. Spot the loony. And now, when I tell people what I do, they move toward me.What was good about psychology \u2014 about the $30 billion investment NIMH made, about working in the disease model, about what you mean by psychology \u2014 is that, 60 years ago, none of the disorders were treatable; it was entirely smoke and mirrors. And now, 14 of the disorders are treatable, two of them actually curable.And the other thing that happened is that a science developed, a science of mental illness. We found out we could take fuzzy concepts like depression, alcoholism, and measure them with rigor; that we could create a classification of the mental illnesses; that we could understand the causality of the mental illnesses. We could look across time at the same people \u2014 people, for example, who were genetically vulnerable to schizophrenia \u2014 and ask what the contribution of mothering, of genetics are, and we could isolate third variables by doing experiments on the mental illnesses.And best of all, we were able, in the last 50 years, to invent drug treatments and psychological treatments. And then we were able to test them rigorously, in random-assignment, placebo-controlled designs, throw out the things that didn't work, keep the things that actively did.The conclusion of that is, psychology and psychiatry of the last 60 years can actually claim that we can make miserable people less miserable. And I think that's terrific. I'm proud of it. But what was not good, the consequences of that, were three things.The first was moral; that psychologists and psychiatrists became victimologists, pathologizers; that our view of human nature was that if you were in trouble, bricks fell on you. And we forgot that people made choices and decisions. We forgot responsibility. That was the first cost.The second cost was that we forgot about you people. We forgot about improving normal lives. We forgot about a mission to make relatively untroubled people happier, more fulfilled, more productive. And \"genius,\" \"high-talent,\" became a dirty word. No one works on that.And the third problem about the disease model is, in our rush to do something about people in trouble, in our rush to do something about repairing damage, it never occurred to us to develop interventions to make people happier \u2014 positive interventions.So that was not good. And so that's what led people like Nancy Etcoff, Dan Gilbert, Mike Csikszentmihalyi and myself to work in something I call, \"positive psychology,\" which has three aims. The first is that psychology should be just as concerned with human strength as it is with weakness. It should be just as concerned with building strength as with repairing damage. It should be interested in the best things in life. And it should be just as concerned with making the lives of normal people fulfilling, and with genius, with nurturing high talent.So in the last 10 years and the hope for the future, we've seen the beginnings of a science of positive psychology, a science of what makes life worth living. It turns out that we can measure different forms of happiness. And any of you, for free, can go to that website \u2014[www.authentichappiness.org]and take the entire panoply of tests of happiness. You can ask, how do you stack up for positive emotion, for meaning, for flow, against literally tens of thousands of other people? We created the opposite of the diagnostic manual of the insanities: a classification of the strengths and virtues that looks at the sex ratio, how they're defined, how to diagnose them, what builds them and what gets in their way. We found that we could discover the causation of the positive states, the relationship between left hemispheric activity and right hemispheric activity, as a cause of happiness.I've spent my life working on extremely miserable people, and I've asked the question: How do extremely miserable people differ from the rest of you? And starting about six years ago, we asked about extremely happy people. How do they differ from the rest of us? It turns out there's one way, very surprising \u2014 they're not more religious, they're not in better shape, they don't have more money, they're not better looking, they don't have more good events and fewer bad events. The one way in which they differ: they're extremely social. They don't sit in seminars on Saturday morning.(Laughter)They don't spend time alone. Each of them is in a romantic relationship and each has a rich repertoire of friends.But watch out here \u2014 this is merely correlational data, not causal, and it's about happiness in the first, \"Hollywood\" sense, I'm going to talk about, happiness of ebullience and giggling and good cheer. And I'm going to suggest to you that's not nearly enough, in just a moment. We found we could begin to look at interventions over the centuries, from the Buddha to Tony Robbins. About 120 interventions have been proposed that allegedly make people happy. And we find that we've been able to manualize many of them, and we actually carry out random-assignment efficacy and effectiveness studies. That is, which ones actually make people lastingly happier? In a couple of minutes, I'll tell you about some of those results.But the upshot of this is that the mission I want psychology to have, in addition to its mission of curing the mentally ill, and in addition to its mission of making miserable people less miserable, is, can psychology actually make people happier? And to ask that question \u2014 \"happy\" is not a word I use very much \u2014 we've had to break it down into what I think is askable about \"happy.\" And I believe there are three different \u2014 I call them \"different\" because different interventions build them, it's possible to have one rather than the other \u2014 three different happy lives. The first happy life is the pleasant life. This is a life in which you have as much positive emotion as you possibly can, and the skills to amplify it. The second is a life of engagement: a life in your work, your parenting, your love, your leisure; time stops for you. That's what Aristotle was talking about. And third, the meaningful life. I want to say a little bit about each of those lives and what we know about them.The first life is the pleasant life, and it's simply, as best we can find it, it's having as many of the pleasures as you can, as much positive emotion as you can, and learning the skills \u2014 savoring, mindfulness \u2014 that amplify them, that stretch them over time and space. But the pleasant life has three drawbacks, and it's why positive psychology is not happy-ology, and why it doesn't end here.The first drawback is, it turns out the pleasant life, your experience of positive emotion, is about 50 percent heritable, and, in fact, not very modifiable. So the different tricks that Matthieu and I and others know about increasing the amount of positive emotion in your life are 15 to 20 percent tricks, getting more of it. Second is that positive emotion habituates. It habituates rapidly, indeed. It's all like French vanilla ice cream: the first taste is 100 percent; by the time you're down to the sixth taste, it's gone. And, as I said, it's not particularly malleable.And this leads to the second life. I have to tell you about my friend Len, to talk about why positive psychology is more than positive emotion, more than building pleasure. In two of the three great arenas of life, by the time Len was 30, Len was enormously successful. The first arena was work. By the time he was 20, he was an options trader. By the time he was 25, he was a multimillionaire and the head of an options trading company. Second, in play, he's a national champion bridge player. But in the third great arena of life, love, Len is an abysmal failure. And the reason he was, was that Len is a cold fish.(Laughter)Len is an introvert. American women said to Len, when he dated them, \"You're no fun. You don't have positive emotion. Get lost.\" And Len was wealthy enough to be able to afford a Park Avenue psychoanalyst, who for five years tried to find the sexual trauma that had somehow locked positive emotion inside of him. But it turned out there wasn't any sexual trauma. It turned out that \u2014 Len grew up in Long Island and he played football and watched football, and played bridge. Len is in the bottom five percent of what we call positive affectivities.The question is: Is Len unhappy? And I want to say, not. Contrary to what psychology told us about the bottom 50 percent of the human race in positive affectivity, I think Len is one of the happiest people I know. He's not consigned to the hell of unhappiness, and that's because Len, like most of you, is enormously capable of flow. When he walks onto the floor of the American Exchange at 9:30 in the morning, time stops for him. And it stops till the closing bell. When the first card is played till 10 days later, when the tournament is over, time stops for Len.And this is indeed what Mike Csikszentmihalyi has been talking about, about flow. And it's distinct from pleasure in a very important way: pleasure has raw feel \u2014 you know it's happening; it's thought and feeling. But what Mike told you yesterday \u2014 during flow ... you can't feel anything. You're one with the music. Time stops. You have intense concentration. And this is indeed the characteristic of what we think of as the good life. And we think there's a recipe for it, and it's knowing what your highest strengths are \u2014 again, there's a valid test of what your five highest strengths are \u2014 and then re-crafting your life to use them as much as you possibly can. Re-crafting your work, your love, your play, your friendship, your parenting.Just one example. One person I worked with was a bagger at Genuardi's. Hated the job. She's working her way through college. Her highest strength was social intelligence. So she re-crafted bagging to make the encounter with her the social highlight of every customer's day. Now, obviously she failed. But what she did was to take her highest strengths, and re-craft work to use them as much as possible. What you get out of that is not smiley-ness. You don't look like Debbie Reynolds. You don't giggle a lot. What you get is more absorption.So, that's the second path. The first path, positive emotion; the second path is eudaemonian flow; and the third path is meaning. This is the most venerable of the happinesses, traditionally. And meaning, in this view, consists of \u2014 very parallel to eudaemonia \u2014 it consists of knowing what your highest strengths are, and using them to belong to and in the service of something larger than you are.I mentioned that for all three kinds of lives \u2014 the pleasant life, the good life, the meaningful life \u2014 people are now hard at work on the question: Are there things that lastingly change those lives? And the answer seems to be yes. And I'll just give you some samples of it. It's being done in a rigorous manner. It's being done in the same way that we test drugs to see what really works. So we do random-assignment, placebo-controlled, long-term studies of different interventions. Just to sample the kind of interventions that we find have an effect: when we teach people about the pleasant life, how to have more pleasure in your life, one of your assignments is to take the mindfulness skills, the savoring skills, and you're assigned to design a beautiful day. Next Saturday, set a day aside, design yourself a beautiful day, and use savoring and mindfulness to enhance those pleasures. And we can show in that way that the pleasant life is enhanced.Gratitude visit. I want you all to do this with me now, if you would. Close your eyes. I'd like you to remember someone who did something enormously important that changed your life in a good direction, and who you never properly thanked. The person has to be alive. Now, OK, you can open your eyes. I hope all of you have such a person. Your assignment, when you're learning the gratitude visit, is to write a 300-word testimonial to that person, call them on the phone in Phoenix, ask if you can visit, don't tell them why. Show up at their door, you read the testimonial \u2014 everyone weeps when this happens. And what happens is, when we test people one week later, a month later, three months later, they're both happier and less depressed.Another example is a strengths date, in which we get couples to identify their highest strengths on the strengths test, and then to design an evening in which they both use their strengths. We find this is a strengthener of relationships. And fun versus philanthropy. It's so heartening to be in a group like this, in which so many of you have turned your lives to philanthropy. Well, my undergraduates and the people I work with haven't discovered this, so we actually have people do something altruistic and do something fun, and contrast it. And what you find is when you do something fun, it has a square wave walk set. When you do something philanthropic to help another person, it lasts and it lasts. So those are examples of positive interventions.So the next to last thing I want to say is: we're interested in how much life satisfaction people have. This is really what you're about. And that's our target variable. And we ask the question as a function of the three different lives, how much life satisfaction do you get? So we ask \u2014 and we've done this in 15 replications, involving thousands of people: To what extent does the pursuit of pleasure, the pursuit of positive emotion, the pleasant life, the pursuit of engagement, time stopping for you, and the pursuit of meaning contribute to life satisfaction?And our results surprised us; they were backward of what we thought. It turns out the pursuit of pleasure has almost no contribution to life satisfaction. The pursuit of meaning is the strongest. The pursuit of engagement is also very strong. Where pleasure matters is if you have both engagement and you have meaning, then pleasure's the whipped cream and the cherry. Which is to say, the full life \u2014 the sum is greater than the parts, if you've got all three. Conversely, if you have none of the three, the empty life, the sum is less than the parts.And what we're asking now is: Does the very same relationship \u2014 physical health, morbidity, how long you live and productivity \u2014 follow the same relationship? That is, in a corporation, is productivity a function of positive emotion, engagement and meaning? Is health a function of positive engagement, of pleasure, and of meaning in life? And there is reason to think the answer to both of those may well be yes.So, Chris said that the last speaker had a chance to try to integrate what he heard, and so this was amazing for me. I've never been in a gathering like this. I've never seen speakers stretch beyond themselves so much, which was one of the remarkable things. But I found that the problems of psychology seemed to be parallel to the problems of technology, entertainment and design in the following way: we all know that technology, entertainment and design have been and can be used for destructive purposes. We also know that technology, entertainment and design can be used to relieve misery. And by the way, the distinction between relieving misery and building happiness is extremely important. I thought, when I first became a therapist 30 years ago, that if I was good enough to make someone not depressed, not anxious, not angry, that I'd make them happy. And I never found that; I found the best you could ever do was to get to zero; that they were empty.And it turns out the skills of happiness, the skills of the pleasant life, the skills of engagement, the skills of meaning, are different from the skills of relieving misery. And so, the parallel thing holds with technology, entertainment and design, I believe. That is, it is possible for these three drivers of our world to increase happiness, to increase positive emotion. And that's typically how they've been used. But once you fractionate happiness the way I do \u2014 not just positive emotion, that's not nearly enough \u2014 there's flow in life, and there's meaning in life. As Laura Lee told us, design and, I believe, entertainment and technology, can be used to increase meaning engagement in life as well.So in conclusion, the eleventh reason for optimism, in addition to the space elevator, is that I think with technology, entertainment and design, we can actually increase the amount of tonnage of human happiness on the planet. And if technology can, in the next decade or two, increase the pleasant life, the good life and the meaningful life, it will be good enough. If entertainment can be diverted to also increase positive emotion, meaning eudaemonia, it will be good enough. And if design can increase positive emotion, eudaemonia, and flow and meaning, what we're all doing together will become good enough.Thank you.(Applause)", "id": 312, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:12.402 --> 00:00:15.474\nWhen I was President of the American\nPsychological Association,\n\n00:00:15.498 --> 00:00:17.124\nthey tried to media-train me.\n\n00:00:17.148 --> 00:00:22.711\nAnd an encounter I had with CNN summarizes\n\n00:00:22.848 --> 00:00:24.836\nwhat I'm going to be talking about today,\n\n00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:27.934\nwhich is the eleventh reason\nto be optimistic.\n\n00:00:27.958 --> 00:00:33.134\nThe editor of Discover told us 10 of them;\n\n00:00:34.157 --> 00:00:36.252\nI'm going to give you the eleventh.\n\n00:00:36.276 --> 00:00:40.035\nSo they came to me, CNN,\nand they said, \"Professor Seligman --\n\n00:00:41.508 --> 00:00:44.721\nwould you tell us about the state\nof psychology today?\n\n00:00:44.745 --> 00:00:46.662\nWe'd like to interview you about that.\"\n\n00:00:46.686 --> 00:00:47.900\nAnd I said, \"Great.\"\n\n00:00:47.924 --> 00:00:52.257\nAnd she said, \"But this is CNN,\nso you only get a sound bite.\"\n\n00:00:53.267 --> 00:00:55.735\nI said, \"Well, how many words do I get?\"\n\n00:00:56.505 --> 00:00:58.142\nAnd she said, \"Well, one.\"\n\n00:00:58.166 --> 00:00:59.522\n(Laughter)\n\n00:00:59.976 --> 00:01:02.315\nAnd the cameras rolled, and she said,\n\n00:01:02.339 --> 00:01:05.656\n\"Professor Seligman,\nwhat is the state of psychology today?\"\n\n00:01:07.186 --> 00:01:08.345\n\"Good.\"\n\n00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:10.497\n(Laughter)\n\n00:01:10.521 --> 00:01:13.521\n\"Cut!

treatable;\n\n00:03:00.853 --> 00:03:02.765\nit was entirely smoke and mirrors.\n\n00:03:02.789 --> 00:03:05.252\nAnd now, 14 of the disorders\nare treatable,\n\n00:03:05.276 --> 00:03:07.180\ntwo of them actually curable.\n\n00:03:07.689 --> 00:03:12.414\nAnd the other thing that happened\nis that a science developed,\n\n00:03:12.438 --> 00:03:14.366\na science of mental illness.\n\n00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:19.166\nWe found out we could take fuzzy concepts\n\n00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:22.170\nlike depression, alcoholism,\n\n00:03:22.194 --> 00:03:23.785\nand measure them with rigor;\n\n00:03:24.227 --> 00:03:28.056\nthat we could create a classification\nof the mental illnesses;\n\n00:03:28.402 --> 00:03:33.083\nthat we could understand\nthe causality of the mental illnesses.\n\n00:03:33.107 --> 00:03:36.934\nWe could look across time\nat the same people --\n\n00:03:36.958 --> 00:03:40.935\npeople, for example, who were genetically\nvulnerable to schizophrenia --\n\n00:03:40.959 --> 00:03:46.171\nand ask what the contribution\nof mothering, of genetics are,\n\n00:03:46.195 --> 00:03:48.559\nand we could isolate third variables\n\n00:03:48.583 --> 00:03:50.934\nby doing experiments\non the mental illnesses.\n\n00:03:51.447 --> 00:03:54.949\nAnd best of all, we were able,\nin the last 50 years,\n\n00:03:54.973 --> 00:03:58.802\nto invent drug treatments\nand psychological treatments.\n\n00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:02.934\nAnd then we were able\nto test them rigorously,\n\n00:04:02.958 --> 00:04:06.251\nin random-assignment,\nplacebo-controlled designs,\n\n00:04:06.275 --> 00:04:08.527\nthrow out the things that didn't work,\n\n00:04:08.551 --> 00:04:10.275\nkeep the things that actively did.\n\n00:04:10.654 --> 00:04:13.817\nThe conclusion of that is,\n\n00:04:13.841 --> 00:04:16.934\npsychology and psychiatry\nof the last 60 years\n\n00:04:16.958 --> 00:04:22.111\ncan actually claim that we can make\nmiserable people less miserable.\n\n00:04:22.616 --> 00:04:24.768\nAnd I think that's terrific.\n\n00:04:24.792 --> 00:04:26.178\nI'm proud of it.\n\n00:04:29.791 --> 00:04:33.359\nBut what was not good,\nthe consequences of that,\n\n00:04:33.473 --> 00:04:34.889\nwere three things.\n\n00:04:34.913 --> 00:04:36.691\nThe first was moral;\n\n00:04:36.715 --> 00:04:41.509\nthat psychologists and psychiatrists\nbecame victimologists, pathologizers;\n\n00:04:41.533 --> 00:04:44.575\nthat our view of human nature\nwas that if you were in trouble,\n\n00:04:44.599 --> 00:04:45.996\nbricks fell on you.\n\n00:04:46.372 --> 00:04:49.113\nAnd we forgot that people\nmade choices and decisions.\n\n00:04:49.137 --> 00:04:50.635\nWe forgot responsibility.\n\n00:04:51.026 --> 00:04:52.701\nThat was the first cost.\n\n00:04:53.175 --> 00:04:56.934\nThe second cost was\nthat we forgot about you people.\n\n00:04:57.479 --> 00:05:01.034\nWe forgot about improving normal lives.\n\n00:05:01.058 --> 00:05:06.934\nWe forgot about a mission to make\nrelatively untroubled people happier,\n\n00:05:06.958 --> 00:05:09.738\nmore fulfilled, more productive.\n\n00:05:09.762 --> 00:05:13.068\nAnd \"genius,\" \"high-talent,\"\nbecame a dirty word.\n\n00:05:13.485 --> 00:05:15.021\nNo one works on that.\n\n00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:18.934\nAnd the third problem\nabout the disease model is,\n\n00:05:18.958 --> 00:05:22.239\nin our rush to do something\nabout people in trouble,\n\n00:05:22.263 --> 00:05:25.979\nin our rush to do something\nabout repairing damage,\n\n00:05:27.391 --> 00:05:30.006\nit never occurred to us\nto develop interventions\n\n00:05:30.030 --> 00:05:33.789\nto make people happier --\npositive interventions.\n\n00:05:34.293 --> 00:05:36.134\nSo that was not good.\n\n00:05:36.158 --> 00:05:40.987\nAnd so that's what led people\nlike Nancy Etcoff, Dan Gilbert,\n\n00:05:41.011 --> 00:05:42.920\nMike Csikszentmihalyi and myself\n\n00:05:42.944 --> 00:05:45.804\nto work in something I call,\n\"positive psychology,\"\n\n00:05:45.828 --> 00:05:47.240\nwhich has three aims.\n\n00:05:47.637 --> 00:05:52.523\nThe first is that psychology\nshould be just as concerned\n\n00:05:52.547 --> 00:05:55.263\nwith human strength\nas it is with weakness.\n\n00:05:55.958 --> 00:06:00.604\nIt should be just as concerned\nwith building strength\n\n00:06:00.628 --> 00:06:02.766\nas with repairing damage.\n\n00:06:02.790 --> 00:06:05.473\nIt should be interested\nin the best things in life.\n\n00:06:05.497 --> 00:06:07.371\nAnd it should be just as concerned\n\n00:06:07.395 --> 00:06:11.108\nwith making the lives\nof normal people fulfilling,\n\n00:06:11.132 --> 00:06:15.081\nand with genius,\nwith nurturing high talent.\n\n00:06:16.026 --> 00:06:20.509\nSo in the last 10 years\nand the hope for the future,\n\n00:06:20.533 --> 00:06:23.934\nwe've seen the beginnings\nof a science of positive psychology,\n\n00:06:23.958 --> 00:06:26.133\na science of what makes life worth living.\n\n00:06:26.497 --> 00:06:31.042\nIt turns out that we can measure\ndifferent forms of happiness.\n\n00:06:31.066 --> 00:06:34.546\nAnd any of you, for free,\ncan go to that website --\n\n00:06:34.570 --> 00:06:35.961\n[www.authentichappiness.org]\n\n00:06:35.985 --> 00:06:38.464\nand take the entire panoply\nof tests of happiness.\n\n00:06:38.488 --> 00:06:42.934\nYou can ask, how do you stack\nup for positive emotion, for meaning,\n\n00:06:42.958 --> 00:06:46.986\nfor flow, against literally tens\nof thousands of other people?\n\n00:06:47.676 --> 00:06:52.934\nWe created the opposite of the diagnostic\nmanual of the insanities:\n\n00:06:52.958 --> 00:06:58.179\na classification of the strengths\nand virtues that looks at the sex ratio,\n\n00:06:58.203 --> 00:07:00.409\nhow they're defined, how to diagnose them,\n\n00:07:00.433 --> 00:07:03.251\nwhat builds them\nand what gets in their way.\n\n00:07:04.958 --> 00:07:09.397\nWe found that we could discover\nthe causation of the positive states,\n\n00:07:09.421 --> 00:07:12.934\nthe relationship between left\nhemispheric activity\n\n00:07:12.958 --> 00:07:18.958\nand right hemispheric activity,\nas a cause of happiness.\n\n00:07:20.458 --> 00:07:23.435\nI've spent my life working\non extremely miserable people,\n\n00:07:23.459 --> 00:07:24.846\nand I've asked the question:\n\n00:07:24.870 --> 00:07:28.523\nHow do extremely miserable people\ndiffer from the rest of you?\n\n00:07:28.547 --> 00:07:32.934\nAnd starting about six years ago,\nwe asked about extremely happy people.\n\n00:07:32.958 --> 00:07:35.498\nHow do they differ from the rest of us?\n\n00:07:35.522 --> 00:07:39.005\nIt turns out there's one way,\nvery surprising --\n\n00:07:39.029 --> 00:07:41.697\nthey're not more religious,\nthey're not in better shape,\n\n00:07:41.721 --> 00:07:44.809\nthey don't have more money,\nthey're not better looking,\n\n00:07:44.833 --> 00:07:47.588\nthey don't have more good events\nand fewer bad events.\n\n00:07:47.612 --> 00:07:51.000\nThe one way in which they differ:\nthey're extremely social.\n\n00:07:52.762 --> 00:07:55.463\nThey don't sit in seminars\non Saturday morning.\n\n00:07:55.487 --> 00:07:59.442\n(Laughter)\n\n00:07:59.935 --> 00:08:01.435\nThey don't spend time alone.\n\n00:08:01.459 --> 00:08:03.657\nEach of them is in a romantic relationship\n\n00:08:03.681 --> 00:08:06.829\nand each has a rich repertoire of friends.\n\n00:08:06.853 --> 00:08:11.230\nBut watch out here -- this is merely\ncorrelational data, not causal,\n\n00:08:11.254 --> 00:08:14.852\nand it's about happiness\nin the first, \"Hollywood\" sense,\n\n00:08:14.876 --> 00:08:16.088\nI'm going to talk about,\n\n00:08:16.112 --> 00:08:20.278\nhappiness of ebullience\nand giggling and good cheer.\n\n00:08:20.302 --> 00:08:23.137\nAnd I'm going to suggest to you\nthat's not nearly enough,\n\n00:08:23.161 --> 00:08:24.311\nin just a moment.\n\n00:08:25.382 --> 00:08:29.763\nWe found we could begin to look\nat interventions over the centuries,\n\n00:08:29.787 --> 00:08:31.580\nfrom the Buddha to Tony Robbins.\n\n00:08:31.604 --> 00:08:36.387\nAbout 120 interventions have been proposed\nthat allegedly make people happy.\n\n00:08:36.814 --> 00:08:41.436\nAnd we find that we've been able\nto manualize many of them,\n\n00:08:41.460 --> 00:08:43.379\nand we actually carry out\n\n00:08:43.403 --> 00:08:47.045\nrandom-assignment efficacy\nand effectiveness studies.\n\n00:08:47.069 --> 00:08:51.225\nThat is, which ones actually\nmake people lastingly happier?\n\n00:08:51.249 --> 00:08:54.476\nIn a couple of minutes, I'll tell you\nabout some of those results.\n\n00:08:54.500 --> 00:09:00.934\nBut the upshot of this is that the mission\nI want psychology to have,\n\n00:09:00.958 --> 00:09:04.445\nin addition to its mission\nof curing the mentally ill,\n\n00:09:04.469 --> 00:09:08.743\nand in addition to its mission of making\nmiserable people less miserable,\n\n00:09:08.767 --> 00:09:12.338\nis, can psychology actually\nmake people happier?\n\n00:09:12.720 --> 00:09:16.866\nAnd to ask that question -- \"happy\"\nis not a word I use very much --\n\n00:09:17.393 --> 00:09:18.806\nwe've had to break it down\n\n00:09:18.830 --> 00:09:21.362\ninto what I think\nis askable about \"happy.\"\n\n00:09:21.386 --> 00:09:24.372\nAnd I believe there are three different --\n\n00:09:25.137 --> 00:09:28.420\nI call them \"different\" because different\ninterventions build them,\n\n00:09:28.444 --> 00:09:30.845\nit's possible to have one\nrather than the other --\n\n00:09:30.869 --> 00:09:32.846\nthree different happy lives.\n\n00:09:32.870 --> 00:09:35.987\nThe first happy life is the pleasant life.\n\n00:09:36.011 --> 00:09:39.396\nThis is a life in which you have\nas much positive emotion\n\n00:09:39.420 --> 00:09:40.934\nas you possibly can,\n\n00:09:40.958 --> 00:09:43.059\nand the skills to amplify it.\n\n00:09:43.083 --> 00:09:45.263\nThe second is a life of engagement:\n\n00:09:45.287 --> 00:09:50.652\na life in your work, your parenting,\nyour love, your leisure;\n\n00:09:50.676 --> 00:09:51.982\ntime stops for you.\n\n00:09:53.100 --> 00:09:55.148\nThat's what Aristotle was talking about.\n\n00:09:55.172 --> 00:09:57.239\nAnd third, the meaningful life.\n\n00:09:57.263 --> 00:09:59.934\nI want to say a little bit\nabout each of those lives\n\n00:09:59.958 --> 00:10:01.775\nand what we know about them.\n\n00:10:01.799 --> 00:10:06.777\nThe first life is the pleasant life,\nand it's simply, as best we can find it,\n\n00:10:06.801 --> 00:10:09.088\nit's having as many\nof the pleasures as you can,\n\n00:10:09.112 --> 00:10:11.221\nas much positive emotion as you can,\n\n00:10:11.511 --> 00:10:17.733\nand learning the skills -- savoring,\nmindfulness -- that amplify them,\n\n00:10:18.072 --> 00:10:20.934\nthat stretch them over time and space.\n\n00:10:20.958 --> 00:10:24.934\nBut the pleasant life has three drawbacks,\n\n00:10:24.958 --> 00:10:28.466\nand it's why positive psychology\nis not happy-ology,\n\n00:10:28.490 --> 00:10:30.367\nand why it doesn't end here.\n\n00:10:30.839 --> 00:10:33.934\nThe first drawback is,\nit turns out the pleasant life,\n\n00:10:33.958 --> 00:10:36.395\nyour experience of positive emotion,\n\n00:10:36.617 --> 00:10:41.340\nis about 50 percent heritable,\n\n00:10:41.364 --> 00:10:44.934\nand, in fact, not very modifiable.\n\n00:10:44.958 --> 00:10:49.497\nSo the different tricks\nthat Matthieu and I and others know\n\n00:10:49.521 --> 00:10:53.132\nabout increasing the amount\nof positive emotion in your life\n\n00:10:53.156 --> 00:10:57.132\nare 15 to 20 percent tricks,\ngetting more of it.\n\n00:10:57.454 --> 00:11:01.696\nSecond is that positive\nemotion habituates.\n\n00:11:01.720 --> 00:11:05.520\nIt habituates rapidly, indeed.\n\n00:11:05.544 --> 00:11:07.914\nIt's all like French vanilla ice cream:\n\n00:11:07.938 --> 00:11:10.553\nthe first taste is 100 percent;\n\n00:11:10.577 --> 00:11:12.746\nby the time you're down\nto the sixth taste,\n\n00:11:12.770 --> 00:11:13.927\nit's gone.\n\n00:11:15.615 --> 00:11:18.747\nAnd, as I said,\nit's not particularly malleable.\n\n00:11:20.398 --> 00:11:22.265\nAnd this leads to the second life.\n\n00:11:22.289 --> 00:11:24.227\nI have to tell you about my friend Len,\n\n00:11:24.251 --> 00:11:30.162\nto talk about why positive psychology\nis more than positive emotion,\n\n00:11:30.186 --> 00:11:31.934\nmore than building pleasure.\n\n00:11:31.958 --> 00:11:35.934\nIn two of the three great arenas\nof life, by the time Len was 30,\n\n00:11:35.958 --> 00:11:38.382\nLen was enormously successful.\n\n00:11:38.406 --> 00:11:41.934\nThe first arena was work.\n\n00:11:41.958 --> 00:11:44.594\nBy the time he was 20,\nhe was an options trader.\n\n00:11:44.618 --> 00:11:47.045\nBy the time he was 25,\nhe was a multimillionaire\n\n00:11:47.069 --> 00:11:49.415\nand the head of an options\ntrading company.\n\n00:11:49.958 --> 00:11:55.105\nSecond, in play, he's a national\nchampion bridge player.\n\n00:11:57.164 --> 00:12:01.934\nBut in the third great arena of life,\nlove, Len is an abysmal failure.\n\n00:12:01.958 --> 00:12:06.900\nAnd the reason he was,\nwas that Len is a cold fish.\n\n00:12:07.958 --> 00:12:09.108\n(Laughter)\n\n00:12:10.052 --> 00:12:11.958\nLen is an introvert.\n\n00:12:14.490 --> 00:12:17.934\nAmerican women said to Len,\nwhen he dated them,\n\n00:12:17.958 --> 00:12:21.934\n\"You're no fun. You don't have\npositive emotion. Get lost.\"\n\n00:12:22.745 --> 00:12:27.934\nAnd Len was wealthy enough to be able\nto afford a Park Avenue psychoanalyst,\n\n00:12:27.958 --> 00:12:31.702\nwho for five years tried\nto find the sexual trauma\n\n00:12:31.726 --> 00:12:35.152\nthat had somehow locked\npositive emotion inside of him.\n\n00:12:35.695 --> 00:12:38.849\nBut it turned out there wasn't\nany sexual trauma.\n\n00:12:38.873 --> 00:12:41.064\nIt turned out that --\n\n00:12:41.088 --> 00:12:43.467\nLen grew up in Long Island\n\n00:12:43.491 --> 00:12:49.073\nand he played football\nand watched football, and played bridge.\n\n00:12:50.334 --> 00:12:54.544\nLen is in the bottom five percent\nof what we call positive affectivities.\n\n00:12:54.568 --> 00:12:56.353\nThe question is: Is Len unhappy?\n\n00:12:56.616 --> 00:12:58.035\nAnd I want to say, not.\n\n00:12:58.385 --> 00:13:01.344\nContrary to what psychology told us\n\n00:13:01.368 --> 00:13:05.520\nabout the bottom 50 percent\nof the human race in positive affectivity,\n\n00:13:05.544 --> 00:13:08.136\nI think Len is one\nof the happiest people I know.\n\n00:13:08.160 --> 00:13:10.806\nHe's not consigned\nto the hell of unhappiness,\n\n00:13:10.830 --> 00:13:14.745\nand that's because Len, like most of you,\n\n00:13:14.769 --> 00:13:16.831\nis enormously capable of flow.\n\n00:13:16.855 --> 00:13:19.829\nWhen he walks onto the floor\nof the American Exchange\n\n00:13:19.853 --> 00:13:21.603\nat 9:30 in the morning,\n\n00:13:22.116 --> 00:13:23.407\ntime stops for him.\n\n00:13:23.431 --> 00:13:25.193\nAnd it stops till the closing bell.\n\n00:13:25.217 --> 00:13:28.117\nWhen the first card is played\ntill 10 days later,\n\n00:13:28.141 --> 00:13:29.499\nwhen the tournament is over,\n\n00:13:29.523 --> 00:13:30.933\ntime stops for Len.\n\n00:13:31.634 --> 00:13:34.846\nAnd this is indeed\nwhat Mike Csikszentmihalyi\n\n00:13:34.870 --> 00:13:36.772\nhas been talking about, about flow.\n\n00:13:36.796 --> 00:13:40.173\nAnd it's distinct from pleasure\nin a very important way:\n\n00:13:40.197 --> 00:13:45.601\npleasure has raw feel -- you know\nit's happening; it's thought and feeling.\n\n00:13:45.625 --> 00:13:48.714\nBut what Mike told you\nyesterday -- during flow ...\n\n00:13:50.877 --> 00:13:52.982\nyou can't feel anything.\n\n00:13:54.530 --> 00:13:56.181\nYou're one with the music.\n\n00:13:56.622 --> 00:13:57.875\nTime stops.\n\n00:13:57.899 --> 00:13:59.793\nYou have intense concentration.\n\n00:13:59.817 --> 00:14:04.568\nAnd this is indeed the characteristic\nof what we think of as the good life.\n\n00:14:05.060 --> 00:14:07.845\nAnd we think there's a recipe for it,\n\n00:14:07.869 --> 00:14:10.463\nand it's knowing what\nyour highest strengths are --\n\n00:14:10.487 --> 00:14:12.781\nagain, there's a valid test\n\n00:14:12.805 --> 00:14:15.188\nof what your five highest strengths are --\n\n00:14:15.212 --> 00:14:17.941\nand then re-crafting your life\n\n00:14:17.965 --> 00:14:21.225\nto use them as much as you possibly can.\n\n00:14:21.249 --> 00:14:23.934\nRe-crafting your work, your love,\n\n00:14:23.958 --> 00:14:26.715\nyour play, your friendship,\nyour parenting.\n\n00:14:26.739 --> 00:14:28.319\nJust one example.\n\n00:14:29.046 --> 00:14:32.654\nOne person I worked with\nwas a bagger at Genuardi's.\n\n00:14:33.114 --> 00:14:34.279\nHated the job.\n\n00:14:34.303 --> 00:14:36.196\nShe's working her way through college.\n\n00:14:36.727 --> 00:14:39.862\nHer highest strength\nwas social intelligence.\n\n00:14:39.886 --> 00:14:44.601\nSo she re-crafted bagging\nto make the encounter with her\n\n00:14:44.625 --> 00:14:47.396\nthe social highlight\nof every customer's day.\n\n00:14:47.880 --> 00:14:49.596\nNow, obviously she failed.\n\n00:14:49.620 --> 00:14:52.934\nBut what she did was to take\nher highest strengths,\n\n00:14:52.958 --> 00:14:56.366\nand re-craft work to use them\nas much as possible.\n\n00:14:56.958 --> 00:14:59.306\nWhat you get out of that\nis not smiley-ness.\n\n00:14:59.330 --> 00:15:01.233\nYou don't look like Debbie Reynolds.\n\n00:15:01.257 --> 00:15:02.661\nYou don't giggle a lot.\n\n00:15:02.685 --> 00:15:05.271\nWhat you get is more absorption.\n\n00:15:05.958 --> 00:15:08.032\nSo, that's the second path.\n\n00:15:08.056 --> 00:15:10.408\nThe first path, positive emotion;\n\n00:15:10.432 --> 00:15:13.528\nthe second path is eudaemonian flow;\n\n00:15:13.552 --> 00:15:15.934\nand the third path is meaning.\n\n00:15:15.958 --> 00:15:19.934\nThis is the most venerable\nof the happinesses, traditionally.\n\n00:15:19.958 --> 00:15:23.457\nAnd meaning, in this view, consists of --\n\n00:15:23.481 --> 00:15:26.401\nvery parallel to eudaemonia --\n\n00:15:26.425 --> 00:15:29.988\nit consists of knowing\nwhat your highest strengths are,\n\n00:15:30.012 --> 00:15:34.655\nand using them to belong to\nand in the service of\n\n00:15:34.679 --> 00:15:36.822\nsomething larger than you are.\n\n00:15:38.880 --> 00:15:42.132\nI mentioned that for all three\nkinds of lives --\n\n00:15:43.205 --> 00:15:46.548\nthe pleasant life, the good life,\nthe meaningful life --\n\n00:15:46.572 --> 00:15:48.736\npeople are now\nhard at work on the question:\n\n00:15:48.760 --> 00:15:52.687\nAre there things that lastingly\nchange those lives?\n\n00:15:53.726 --> 00:15:56.725\nAnd the answer seems to be yes.\n\n00:15:56.749 --> 00:15:59.304\nAnd I'll just give you some samples of it.\n\n00:15:59.328 --> 00:16:01.492\nIt's being done in a rigorous manner.\n\n00:16:01.516 --> 00:16:04.353\nIt's being done in the same way\nthat we test drugs\n\n00:16:04.377 --> 00:16:05.986\nto see what really works.\n\n00:16:06.471 --> 00:16:11.284\nSo we do random-assignment,\nplacebo-controlled,\n\n00:16:11.308 --> 00:16:14.155\nlong-term studies\nof different interventions.\n\n00:16:14.179 --> 00:16:18.684\nJust to sample the kind of interventions\nthat we find have an effect:\n\n00:16:18.708 --> 00:16:21.934\nwhen we teach people\nabout the pleasant life,\n\n00:16:21.958 --> 00:16:23.934\nhow to have more pleasure in your life,\n\n00:16:23.958 --> 00:16:27.977\none of your assignments\nis to take the mindfulness skills,\n\n00:16:28.001 --> 00:16:30.416\nthe savoring skills,\n\n00:16:30.440 --> 00:16:33.198\nand you're assigned\nto design a beautiful day.\n\n00:16:34.131 --> 00:16:39.145\nNext Saturday, set a day aside,\ndesign yourself a beautiful day,\n\n00:16:39.169 --> 00:16:43.363\nand use savoring and mindfulness\nto enhance those pleasures.\n\n00:16:43.387 --> 00:16:47.888\nAnd we can show in that way\nthat the pleasant life is enhanced.\n\n00:16:49.696 --> 00:16:50.920\nGratitude visit.\n\n00:16:53.041 --> 00:16:55.697\nI want you all to do this\nwith me now, if you would.\n\n00:16:55.721 --> 00:16:56.969\nClose your eyes.\n\n00:16:58.770 --> 00:17:03.114\nI'd like you to remember someone\n\n00:17:03.138 --> 00:17:06.186\nwho did something enormously important\n\n00:17:06.210 --> 00:17:09.934\nthat changed your life\nin a good direction,\n\n00:17:09.958 --> 00:17:11.891\nand who you never properly thanked.\n\n00:17:13.105 --> 00:17:14.594\nThe person has to be alive.\n\n00:17:15.958 --> 00:17:18.121\nNow, OK, you can open your eyes.\n\n00:17:18.145 --> 00:17:20.479\nI hope all of you have such a person.\n\n00:17:20.503 --> 00:17:24.101\nYour assignment, when you're learning\nthe gratitude visit,\n\n00:17:24.125 --> 00:17:27.774\nis to write a 300-word\ntestimonial to that person,\n\n00:17:28.492 --> 00:17:30.421\ncall them on the phone in Phoenix,\n\n00:17:31.119 --> 00:17:33.766\nask if you can visit, don't tell them why.\n\n00:17:33.790 --> 00:17:35.293\nShow up at their door,\n\n00:17:36.257 --> 00:17:40.254\nyou read the testimonial --\neveryone weeps when this happens.\n\n00:17:41.537 --> 00:17:44.439\nAnd what happens is, when we test people\n\n00:17:44.463 --> 00:17:47.582\none week later, a month later,\nthree months later,\n\n00:17:47.606 --> 00:17:50.264\nthey're both happier and less depressed.\n\n00:17:51.680 --> 00:17:54.015\nAnother example is a strengths date,\n\n00:17:54.039 --> 00:17:58.221\nin which we get couples to identify\ntheir highest strengths\n\n00:17:58.245 --> 00:17:59.620\non the strengths test,\n\n00:17:59.644 --> 00:18:04.725\nand then to design an evening\nin which they both use their strengths.\n\n00:18:04.749 --> 00:18:08.242\nWe find this is a strengthener\nof relationships.\n\n00:18:08.746 --> 00:18:10.720\nAnd fun versus philanthropy.\n\n00:18:10.744 --> 00:18:13.464\nIt's so heartening\nto be in a group like this,\n\n00:18:13.488 --> 00:18:17.088\nin which so many of you have turned\nyour lives to philanthropy.\n\n00:18:17.112 --> 00:18:20.770\nWell, my undergraduates and the people\nI work with haven't discovered this,\n\n00:18:20.794 --> 00:18:23.602\nso we actually have people\ndo something altruistic\n\n00:18:24.380 --> 00:18:26.044\nand do something fun,\n\n00:18:26.155 --> 00:18:27.309\nand contrast it.\n\n00:18:27.333 --> 00:18:29.934\nAnd what you find\nis when you do something fun,\n\n00:18:29.958 --> 00:18:31.847\nit has a square wave walk set.\n\n00:18:31.871 --> 00:18:35.507\nWhen you do something philanthropic\nto help another person,\n\n00:18:35.531 --> 00:18:37.620\nit lasts and it lasts.\n\n00:18:38.484 --> 00:18:42.004\nSo those are examples\nof positive interventions.\n\n00:18:42.638 --> 00:18:46.054\nSo the next to last thing\nI want to say is:\n\n00:18:46.958 --> 00:18:50.077\nwe're interested in how much\nlife satisfaction people have.\n\n00:18:50.101 --> 00:18:52.041\nThis is really what you're about.\n\n00:18:52.065 --> 00:18:53.934\nAnd that's our target variable.\n\n00:18:53.958 --> 00:18:57.934\nAnd we ask the question as a function\nof the three different lives,\n\n00:18:57.958 --> 00:19:00.174\nhow much life satisfaction do you get?\n\n00:19:00.705 --> 00:19:03.810\nSo we ask -- and we've done this\nin 15 replications,\n\n00:19:03.834 --> 00:19:06.212\ninvolving thousands of people:\n\n00:19:06.236 --> 00:19:08.731\nTo what extent does\nthe pursuit of pleasure,\n\n00:19:08.755 --> 00:19:10.527\nthe pursuit of positive emotion,\n\n00:19:11.101 --> 00:19:12.275\nthe pleasant life,\n\n00:19:12.299 --> 00:19:15.707\nthe pursuit of engagement,\ntime stopping for you,\n\n00:19:15.731 --> 00:19:19.105\nand the pursuit of meaning\ncontribute to life satisfaction?\n\n00:19:19.129 --> 00:19:22.723\nAnd our results surprised us;\nthey were backward of what we thought.\n\n00:19:22.747 --> 00:19:26.251\nIt turns out the pursuit of pleasure\nhas almost no contribution\n\n00:19:26.275 --> 00:19:27.934\nto life satisfaction.\n\n00:19:27.958 --> 00:19:30.487\nThe pursuit of meaning is the strongest.\n\n00:19:30.511 --> 00:19:34.658\nThe pursuit of engagement\nis also very strong.\n\n00:19:34.958 --> 00:19:39.592\nWhere pleasure matters\nis if you have both engagement\n\n00:19:39.616 --> 00:19:41.225\nand you have meaning,\n\n00:19:41.249 --> 00:19:43.538\nthen pleasure's the whipped\ncream and the cherry.\n\n00:19:43.562 --> 00:19:50.080\nWhich is to say, the full life --\nthe sum is greater than the parts,\n\n00:19:50.104 --> 00:19:51.510\nif you've got all three.\n\n00:19:51.534 --> 00:19:54.776\nConversely, if you have none\nof the three, the empty life,\n\n00:19:54.800 --> 00:19:56.457\nthe sum is less than the parts.\n\n00:19:56.481 --> 00:20:00.732\nAnd what we're asking now is:\nDoes the very same relationship --\n\n00:20:00.756 --> 00:20:05.699\nphysical health, morbidity,\nhow long you live and productivity --\n\n00:20:05.723 --> 00:20:07.132\nfollow the same relationship?\n\n00:20:07.156 --> 00:20:09.634\nThat is, in a corporation,\n\n00:20:09.658 --> 00:20:15.497\nis productivity a function of positive\nemotion, engagement and meaning?\n\n00:20:15.521 --> 00:20:18.688\nIs health a function\nof positive engagement,\n\n00:20:18.712 --> 00:20:21.449\nof pleasure, and of meaning in life?\n\n00:20:21.473 --> 00:20:25.688\nAnd there is reason to think the answer\nto both of those may well be yes.\n\n00:20:28.162 --> 00:20:32.591\nSo, Chris said that the last\nspeaker had a chance\n\n00:20:32.615 --> 00:20:35.036\nto try to integrate what he heard,\n\n00:20:35.060 --> 00:20:36.766\nand so this was amazing for me.\n\n00:20:36.790 --> 00:20:40.084\nI've never been in a gathering like this.\n\n00:20:40.759 --> 00:20:44.483\nI've never seen speakers stretch\nbeyond themselves so much,\n\n00:20:44.507 --> 00:20:46.579\nwhich was one of the remarkable things.\n\n00:20:46.958 --> 00:20:50.934\nBut I found that the problems\nof psychology seemed to be parallel\n\n00:20:50.958 --> 00:20:55.173\nto the problems of technology,\nentertainment and design\n\n00:20:55.197 --> 00:20:56.672\nin the following way:\n\n00:20:56.696 --> 00:21:00.178\nwe all know that technology,\nentertainment and design\n\n00:21:00.202 --> 00:21:05.202\nhave been and can be used\nfor destructive purposes.\n\n00:21:06.329 --> 00:21:10.484\nWe also know that technology,\nentertainment and design\n\n00:21:10.508 --> 00:21:13.027\ncan be used to relieve misery.\n\n00:21:13.509 --> 00:21:16.934\nAnd by the way, the distinction\nbetween relieving misery\n\n00:21:16.958 --> 00:21:19.934\nand building happiness\nis extremely important.\n\n00:21:19.958 --> 00:21:23.569\nI thought, when I first became\na therapist 30 years ago,\n\n00:21:23.593 --> 00:21:28.934\nthat if I was good enough\nto make someone not depressed,\n\n00:21:28.958 --> 00:21:32.006\nnot anxious, not angry,\n\n00:21:32.825 --> 00:21:34.291\nthat I'd make them happy.\n\n00:21:34.860 --> 00:21:36.235\nAnd I never found that;\n\n00:21:36.259 --> 00:21:38.281\nI found the best you could ever do\n\n00:21:38.305 --> 00:21:39.707\nwas to get to zero;\n\n00:21:40.308 --> 00:21:41.522\nthat they were empty.\n\n00:21:41.546 --> 00:21:47.152\nAnd it turns out the skills of happiness,\nthe skills of the pleasant life,\n\n00:21:47.176 --> 00:21:49.547\nthe skills of engagement,\nthe skills of meaning,\n\n00:21:49.571 --> 00:21:53.722\nare different from the skills\nof relieving misery.\n\n00:21:54.293 --> 00:21:59.664\nAnd so, the parallel thing holds\nwith technology, entertainment\n\n00:21:59.688 --> 00:22:01.261\nand design, I believe.\n\n00:22:01.285 --> 00:22:08.164\nThat is, it is possible\nfor these three drivers of our world\n\n00:22:08.188 --> 00:22:10.403\nto increase happiness,\n\n00:22:10.716 --> 00:22:13.604\nto increase positive emotion.\n\n00:22:13.628 --> 00:22:15.815\nAnd that's typically\nhow they've been used.\n\n00:22:15.839 --> 00:22:18.449\nBut once you fractionate\nhappiness the way I do --\n\n00:22:18.861 --> 00:22:21.934\nnot just positive emotion,\nthat's not nearly enough --\n\n00:22:21.958 --> 00:22:25.091\nthere's flow in life,\nand there's meaning in life.\n\n00:22:25.464 --> 00:22:26.934\nAs Laura Lee told us,\n\n00:22:26.958 --> 00:22:30.626\ndesign and, I believe,\nentertainment and technology,\n\n00:22:30.650 --> 00:22:35.381\ncan be used to increase meaning\nengagement in life as well.\n\n00:22:35.405 --> 00:22:37.025\nSo in conclusion,\n\n00:22:37.049 --> 00:22:39.476\nthe eleventh reason for optimism,\n\n00:22:39.500 --> 00:22:42.675\nin addition to the space elevator,\n\n00:22:42.699 --> 00:22:47.830\nis that I think with technology,\nentertainment and design,\n\n00:22:47.854 --> 00:22:51.602\nwe can actually increase\nthe amount of tonnage\n\n00:22:51.626 --> 00:22:53.876\nof human happiness on the planet.\n\n00:22:54.479 --> 00:22:58.742\nAnd if technology can,\nin the next decade or two,\n\n00:22:58.766 --> 00:23:02.630\nincrease the pleasant life,\nthe good life and the meaningful life,\n\n00:23:02.654 --> 00:23:04.144\nit will be good enough.\n\n00:23:04.168 --> 00:23:09.773\nIf entertainment can be diverted\nto also increase positive emotion,\n\n00:23:09.925 --> 00:23:13.019\nmeaning eudaemonia,\n\n00:23:13.043 -->

southern Africa dates back hundreds of years. But modernization actually brought communication and a whole new material, in the form of telephone wire. Rural to urban migration meant that newfound industrial materials started to replace hard-to-come-by natural grasses.So, here you can see the change from use \u2014 starting to use contemporary materials. These pieces date back from the '40s to the late '50s. In the '90s, my interest and passion for transitional art forms led me to a new form, which came from a squatter camp outside Durban.And I got the opportunity to start working with this community at that point, and started developing, really, and mentoring them in terms of scale, in terms of the design. And the project soon grew from five to 50 weavers in about a year. Soon we had outgrown the scrap yards, what they could provide, so we coerced a wire manufacturer to help us, and not only to supply the materials on bobbins, but to produce to our color specifications.At the same time, I was thinking, well, there's lots of possibility here to produce contemporary products, away from the ethnic, a little bit more contemporary. So I developed a whole range around \u2014 mass-produced range \u2014 that obviously fitted into a much higher-end decor market that could be exported and also service our local market.We started experimenting, as you can see, in terms of shapes, forms. The scale became very important, and it's become our pet project. It's successful, it's been running for 12 years. And we supply the Conran shops, and Donna Karan, and so it's kind of great.This is our group, our main group of weavers. They come on a weekly basis to Durban. They all have bank accounts. They've all moved back to the rural area where they came from. It's a weekly turnaround of production. This is the community that I originally showed you the slide of. And that's also modernized today, and it's supporting work for 300 weavers. And the rest says it all.Thank you very much.

Stories that offer transformation, that lean into transcendence, but that are never sentimental, that never look away from the darkest things about us. Because I really believe that we're never more beautiful than when we're most ugly. Because that's really the moment we really know what we're made of. As Chris said, I grew up in Nigeria with a whole generation \u2014 in the '80s \u2014 of students who were protesting a military dictatorship, which has finally ended. So it wasn't just me, there was a whole generation of us.But what I've come to learn is that the world is never saved in grand messianic gestures, but in the simple accumulation of gentle, soft, almost invisible acts of compassion, everyday acts of compassion. In South Africa, they have a phrase called Ubuntu. Ubuntu comes out of a philosophy that says, the only way for me to be human is for you to reflect my humanity back at me. But if you're like me, my humanity is more like a window. I don't really see it, I don't pay attention to it until there's, you know, like a bug that's dead on the window. Then suddenly I see it, and usually, it's never good. It's usually when I'm cussing in traffic at someone who is trying to drive their car and drink coffee and send emails and make notes. So what Ubuntu really says is that there is no way for us to be human without other people. It's really very simple, but really very complicated.So, I thought I should start with some stories. I should tell you some stories about remarkable people, so I thought I'd start with my mother. (Laughter) And she was dark, too. My mother was English. My parents met in Oxford in the '50s, and my mother moved to Nigeria and lived there. She was five foot two, very feisty and very English. This is how English my mother is \u2014 or was, she just passed. She came out to California, to Los Angeles, to visit me, and we went to Malibu, which she thought was very disappointing. (Laughter) And then we went to a fish restaurant, and we had Chad, the surfer dude, serving us, and he came up and my mother said, \"Do you have any specials, young man?\" And Chad says, \"Sure, like, we have this, like, salmon, that's, like, rolled in this, like, wasabi, like, crust. It's totally rad.\" And my mother turned to me and said, \"What language is he speaking?\" (Laughter) I said, \"English, mum.\" And she shook her head and said, \"Oh, these Americans. We gave them a language, why don't they use it?\" (Laughter)So, this woman, who converted from the Church of England to Catholicism when she married my father \u2014 and there's no one more rabid than a Catholic convert \u2014 decided to teach in the rural areas in Nigeria, particularly among Igbo women, the Billings ovulation method, which was the only approved birth control by the Catholic Church. But her Igbo wasn't too good. So she took me along to translate. I was seven. (Laughter) So, here are these women, who never discuss their period with their husbands, and here I am telling them, \"Well, how often do you get your period?\" (Laughter) And, \"Do you notice any discharges?\" (Laughter) And, \"How swollen is your vulva?\" (Laughter) She never would have thought of herself as a feminist, my mother, but she always used to say, \"Anything a man can do, I can fix.\" (Applause) And when my father complained about this situation, where she's taking a seven-year-old boy to teach this birth control, you know, he used to say, \"Oh, you're turning him into \u2014 you're teaching him how to be a woman.\" My mother said, \"Someone has to.\" (Laughter)This woman \u2014 during the Biafran war, we were caught in the war. It was my mother with five little children. It takes her one year, through refugee camp after refugee camp, to make her way to an airstrip where we can fly out of the country. At every single refugee camp, she has to face off soldiers who want to take my elder brother Mark, who was nine, and make him a boy soldier. Can you imagine this five-foot-two woman, standing up to men with guns who want to kill us? All through that one year, my mother never cried one time, not once. But when we were in Lisbon, in the airport, about to fly to England, this woman saw my mother wearing this dress, which had been washed so many times it was basically see through, with five really hungry-looking kids, came over and asked her what had happened. And she told this woman. And so this woman emptied out her suitcase and gave all of her clothes to my mother, and to us, and the toys of her kids, who didn't like that very much, but \u2014 (Laughter) \u2014 that was the only time she cried. And I remember years later, I was writing about my mother, and I asked her, \"Why did you cry then?\" And she said, \"You know, you can steel your heart against any kind of trouble, any kind of horror. But the simple act of kindness from a complete stranger will unstitch you.\"The old women in my father's village, after this war had happened, memorized the names of every dead person, and they would sing these dirges, made up of these names. Dirges so melancholic that they would scorch you. And they would sing them only when they planted the rice, as though they were seeding the hearts of the dead into the rice. But when it came for harvest time, they would sing these joyful songs, that were made up of the names of every child who had been born that year. And then the next planting season, when they sang the dirge, they would remove as many names of the dead that equaled as many people that were born. And in this way, these women enacted a lot of transformation, beautiful transformation.Did you know, that before the genocide in Rwanda, the word for rape and the word for marriage was the same one? But today, women are rebuilding Rwanda. Did you also know that after apartheid, when the new government went into the parliament houses, there were no female toilets in the building? Which would seem to suggest that apartheid was entirely the business of men. All of this to say, that despite the horror, and despite the death, women are never really counted. Their humanity never seems to matter very much to us.When I was growing up in Nigeria \u2014 and I shouldn't say Nigeria, because that's too general, but in Afikpo, the Igbo part of the country where I'm from \u2014 there were always rites of passage for young men. Men were taught to be men in the ways in which we are not women, that's essentially what it is. And a lot of rituals involved killing, killing little animals, progressing along, so when I turned 13 \u2014 and, I mean, it made sense, it was an agrarian community, somebody had to kill the animals, there was no Whole Foods you could go and get kangaroo steak at \u2014 so when I turned 13, it was my turn now to kill a goat. And I was this weird, sensitive kid, who couldn't really do it, but I had to do it. And I was supposed to do this alone. But a friend of mine, called Emmanuel, who was significantly older than me, who'd been a boy soldier during the Biafran war, decided to come with me. Which sort of made me feel good, because he'd seen a lot of things. Now, when I was growing up, he used to tell me stories about how he used to bayonet people, and their intestines would fall out, but they would keep running. So, this guy comes with me. And I don't know if you've ever heard a goat, or seen one \u2014 they sound like human beings, that's why we call tragedies \"a song of a goat.\" My friend Brad Kessler says that we didn't become human until we started keeping goats. Anyway, a goat's eyes are like a child's eyes. So when I tried to kill this goat and I couldn't, Emmanuel bent down, he puts his hand over the mouth of the goat, covers its eyes, so I don't have to look into them, while I kill the goat. It didn't seem like a lot, for this guy who'd seen so much, and to whom the killing of a goat must have seemed such a quotidian experience, still found it in himself to try to protect me. I was a wimp. I cried for a very long time. And afterwards, he didn't say a word. He just sat there watching me cry for an hour. And then afterwards he said to me, \"It will always be difficult, but if you cry like this every time, you will die of heartbreak. Just know that it is enough sometimes to know that it is difficult.\" Of course, talking about goats makes me think of sheep, and not in good ways. (Laughter)So, I was born two days after Christmas. So growing up, you know, I had a cake and everything, but I never got any presents, because, born two days after Christmas. So, I was about nine, and my uncle had just come back from Germany, and we had the Catholic priest over, my mother was entertaining him with tea. And my uncle suddenly says, \"Where are Chris' presents?\" And my mother said, \"Don't talk about that in front of guests.\" But he was desperate to show that he'd just come back, so he summoned me up, and he said, \"Go into the bedroom, my bedroom. Take anything you want out of the suitcase. It's your birthday present.\" I'm sure he thought I'd take a book or a shirt, but I found an inflatable sheep. (Laughter) So, I blew it up and ran into the living room, my finger where it shouldn't have been, I was waving this buzzing sheep around, and my mother looked like she was going to die of shock. (Laughter) And Father McGetrick was completely unflustered, just stirred his tea and looked at my mother and said, \"It's all right Daphne, I'm Scottish.\" (Laughter) (Applause)My last days in prison, the last 18 months, my cellmate \u2014 for the last year, the first year of the last 18 months \u2014 my cellmate was 14 years old. The name was John James, and in those days, if a family member committed a crime, the military would hold you as ransom till your family turned themselves in. So, here was this 14-year-old kid on death row. And not everybody on death row was a political prisoner. There were some really bad people there. And he had smuggled in two comics, two comic books \u2014 \"Spiderman\" and \"X-Men.\" He was obsessed. And when he got tired of reading them, he started to teach the men in death row how to read, with these comic books. And so, I remember night after night, you'd hear all these men, these really hardened criminals, huddled around John James, reciting, \"Take that, Spidey!\" (Laughter) It's incredible. I was really worried. He didn't know what death row meant. I'd been there twice, and I was terribly afraid that I was going to die. And he would always laugh, and say, \"Come on, man, we'll make it out.\" Then I'd say, \"How do you know?\" And he said, \"Oh, I heard it on the grapevine.\" They killed him. They handcuffed him to a chair, and they tacked his penis to a table with a six-inch nail, then left him there to bleed to death. That's how I ended up in solitary, because I let my feelings be known. All around us, everywhere, there are people like this.The Igbo used to say that they built their own gods. They would come together as a community, and they would express a wish. And their wish would then be brought to a priest, who would find a ritual object, and the appropriate sacrifices would be made, and the shrine would be built for the god. But if the god became unruly and began to ask for human sacrifice, the Igbos would destroy the god. They would knock down the shrine, and they would stop saying the god's name. This is how they came to reclaim their humanity. Every day, all of us here, we're building gods that have gone rampant, and it's time we started knocking them down and forgetting their names. It doesn't require a tremendous thing. All it requires is to recognize among us, every day \u2014 the few of us that can see \u2014 are surrounded by people like the ones I've told you.There are some of you in this room, amazing people, who offer all of us the mirror to our own humanity. I want to end with a poem by an American poet called Lucille Clifton. The poem is called \"Libation,\" and it's for my friend Vusi who is in the audience here somewhere. \"Libation, North Carolina, 1999. I offer to this ground, this gin. I imagine an old man crying here, out of the sight of the overseer. He pushes his tongue through a hole where his tooth would be, if he were whole. It aches in that space where his tooth would be, where his land would be, his house, his wife, his son, his beautiful daughter. He wipes sorrow from his face, and puts his thirsty finger to his thirsty tongue, and tastes the salt. I call a name that could be his. This is for you, old man.

We gave them a language,\n\n00:03:01.958 --> 00:03:03.958\nwhy don't they use it?\"\n\n00:03:03.958 --> 00:03:09.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:03:09.958 --> 00:03:13.958\nSo, this woman, who converted from the Church of England\n\n00:03:13.958 --> 00:03:15.958\nto Catholicism when she married my father --\n\n00:03:15.958 --> 00:03:19.958\nand there's no one more rabid than a Catholic convert --\n\n00:03:19.958 --> 00:03:23.958\ndecided to teach in the rural areas in Nigeria,\n\n00:03:23.958 --> 00:03:25.958\nparticularly among Igbo women,\n\n00:03:25.958 --> 00:03:27.958\nthe Billings ovulation method,\n\n00:03:27.958 --> 00:03:31.958\nwhich was the only approved birth control by the Catholic Church.\n\n00:03:31.958 --> 00:03:35.958\nBut her Igbo wasn't too good.\n\n00:03:35.958 --> 00:03:37.958\nSo she took me along to translate.\n\n00:03:37.958 --> 00:03:39.958\nI was seven.\n\n00:03:39.958 --> 00:03:40.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:03:40.958 --> 00:03:42.958\nSo, here are these women,\n\n00:03:42.958 --> 00:03:45.958\nwho never discuss their period with their husbands,\n\n00:03:45.958 --> 00:03:49.958\nand here I am telling them, \"Well, how often do you get your period?\"\n\n00:03:49.958 --> 00:03:50.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:03:50.958 --> 00:03:52.958\nAnd, \"Do you notice any discharges?\"\n\n00:03:52.958 --> 00:03:53.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:03:53.958 --> 00:03:55.958\nAnd, \"How swollen is your vulva?\"\n\n00:03:55.958 --> 00:04:00.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:04:00.958 --> 00:04:03.958\nShe never would have thought of herself as a feminist,\n\n00:04:03.958 --> 00:04:06.958\nmy mother, but she always used to say,\n\n00:04:06.958 --> 00:04:09.958\n\"Anything a man can do, I can fix.\"\n\n00:04:09.958 --> 00:04:15.958\n(Applause)\n\n00:04:16.958 --> 00:04:21.958\nAnd when my father complained about this situation,\n\n00:04:21.958 --> 00:04:23.958\nwhere she's taking a seven-year-old boy\n\n00:04:23.958 --> 00:04:25.958\nto teach this birth control, you know,\n\n00:04:25.958 --> 00:04:27.958\nhe used to say, \"Oh, you're turning him into --\n\n00:04:27.958 --> 00:04:29.958\nyou're teaching him how to be a woman.\"\n\n00:04:29.958 --> 00:04:31.958\nMy mother said, \"Someone has to.\"\n\n00:04:31.958 --> 00:04:32.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:04:32.958 --> 00:04:35.958\nThis woman -- during the Biafran war,\n\n00:04:36.958 --> 00:04:38.958\nwe were caught in the war.\n\n00:04:38.958 --> 00:04:41.958\nIt was my mother with five little children.\n\n00:04:41.958 --> 00:04:44.958\nIt takes her one year, through refugee camp after refugee camp,\n\n00:04:44.958 --> 00:04:46.958\nto make her way to an airstrip where we can fly out of the country.\n\n00:04:46.958 --> 00:04:52.958\nAt every single refugee camp, she has to face off soldiers\n\n00:04:52.958 --> 00:04:54.958\nwho want to take my elder brother Mark, who was nine,\n\n00:04:54.958 --> 00:04:56.958\nand make him a boy soldier.\n\n00:04:56.958 --> 00:04:58.958\nCan you imagine this five-foot-two woman,\n\n00:04:58.958 --> 00:05:01.958\nstanding up to men with guns who want to kill us?\n\n00:05:02.958 --> 00:05:04.958\nAll through that one year,\n\n00:05:04.958 --> 00:05:07.958\nmy mother never cried one time, not once.\n\n00:05:07.958 --> 00:05:09.958\nBut when we were in Lisbon, in the airport,\n\n00:05:09.958 --> 00:05:11.958\nabout to fly to England,\n\n00:05:11.958 --> 00:05:14.958\nthis woman saw my mother wearing this dress,\n\n00:05:14.958 --> 00:05:18.958\nwhich had been washed so many times it was basically see through,\n\n00:05:18.958 --> 00:05:21.958\nwith five really hungry-looking kids,\n\n00:05:21.958 --> 00:05:23.958\ncame over and asked her what had happened.\n\n00:05:23.958 --> 00:05:24.958\nAnd she told this woman.\n\n00:05:24.958 --> 00:05:26.958\nAnd so this woman emptied out her suitcase\n\n00:05:26.958 --> 00:05:29.958\nand gave all of her clothes to my mother, and to us,\n\n00:05:29.958 --> 00:05:32.958\nand the toys of her kids, who didn't like that very much, but --\n\n00:05:32.958 --> 00:05:33.958\n(Laughter) --\n\n00:05:33.958 --> 00:05:35.958\nthat was the only time she cried.\n\n00:05:36.958 --> 00:05:38.958\nAnd I remember years later, I was writing about my mother,\n\n00:05:38.958 --> 00:05:40.958\nand I asked her, \"Why did you cry then?\"\n\n00:05:40.958 --> 00:05:43.958\nAnd she said, \"You know, you can steel your heart\n\n00:05:43.958 --> 00:05:46.958\nagainst any kind of trouble, any kind of horror.\n\n00:05:46.958 --> 00:05:51.958\nBut the simple act of kindness from a complete stranger\n\n00:05:51.958 --> 00:05:53.958\nwill unstitch you.\"\n\n00:05:57.958 --> 00:06:01.958\nThe old women in my father's village, after this war had happened,\n\n00:06:01.958 --> 00:06:04.958\nmemorized the names of every dead person,\n\n00:06:04.958 --> 00:06:11.958\nand they would sing these dirges, made up of these names.\n\n00:06:11.958 --> 00:06:13.958\nDirges so melancholic that they would scorch you.\n\n00:06:13.958 --> 00:06:17.958\nAnd they would sing them only when they planted the rice,\n\n00:06:17.958 --> 00:06:19.958\nas though they were seeding the hearts of the dead\n\n00:06:19.958 --> 00:06:21.958\ninto the rice.\n\n00:06:21.958 --> 00:06:23.958\nBut when it came for harvest time,\n\n00:06:23.958 --> 00:06:25.958\nthey would sing these joyful songs,\n\n00:06:25.958 --> 00:06:27.958\nthat were made up of the names of every child\n\n00:06:27.958 --> 00:06:29.958\nwho had been born that year.\n\n00:06:30.958 --> 00:06:34.958\nAnd then the next planting season, when they sang the dirge,\n\n00:06:34.958 --> 00:06:37.958\nthey would remove as many names of the dead\n\n00:06:37.958 --> 00:06:39.958\nthat equaled as many people that were born.\n\n00:06:39.958 --> 00:06:45.958\nAnd in this way, these women enacted a lot of transformation,\n\n00:06:45.958 --> 00:06:47.958\nbeautiful transformation.\n\n00:06:47.958 --> 00:06:51.958\nDid you know, that before the genocide in Rwanda,\n\n00:06:51.958 --> 00:06:54.958\nthe word for rape and the word for marriage\n\n00:06:54.958 --> 00:06:56.958\nwas the same one?\n\n00:06:57.958 --> 00:07:01.958\nBut today, women are rebuilding Rwanda.\n\n00:07:01.958 --> 00:07:04.958\nDid you also know that after apartheid,\n\n00:07:04.958 --> 00:07:06.958\nwhen the new government went into the parliament houses,\n\n00:07:06.958 --> 00:07:10.958\nthere were no female toilets in the building?\n\n00:07:10.958 --> 00:07:12.958\nWhich would seem to suggest that apartheid\n\n00:07:12.958 --> 00:07:14.958\nwas entirely the business of men.\n\n00:07:15.958 --> 00:07:19.958\nAll of this to say, that despite the horror, and despite the death,\n\n00:07:19.958 --> 00:07:22.958\nwomen are never really counted.\n\n00:07:22.958 --> 00:07:26.958\nTheir humanity never seems to matter very much to us.\n\n00:07:27.958 --> 00:07:30.958\nWhen I was growing up in Nigeria --\n\n00:07:30.958 --> 00:07:32.958\nand I shouldn't say Nigeria, because that's too general,\n\n00:07:32.958 --> 00:07:35.958\nbut in Afikpo, the Igbo part of the country where I'm from --\n\n00:07:35.958 --> 00:07:38.958\nthere were always rites of passage for young men.\n\n00:07:38.958 --> 00:07:42.958\nMen were taught to be men in the ways in which we are not women,\n\n00:07:42.958 --> 00:07:44.958\nthat's essentially what it is.\n\n00:07:44.958 --> 00:07:48.958\nAnd a lot of rituals involved killing, killing little animals,\n\n00:07:48.958 --> 00:07:50.958\nprogressing along, so when I turned 13 --\n\n00:07:50.958 --> 00:07:53.958\nand, I mean, it made sense, it was an agrarian community,\n\n00:07:53.958 --> 00:07:55.958\nsomebody had to kill the animals,\n\n00:07:55.958 --> 00:07:58.958\nthere was no Whole Foods you could go and get kangaroo steak at --\n\n00:07:58.958 --> 00:08:03.958\nso when I turned 13, it was my turn now to kill a goat.\n\n00:08:03.958 --> 00:08:07.958\nAnd I was this weird, sensitive kid, who couldn't really do it,\n\n00:08:07.958 --> 00:08:09.958\nbut I had to do it.\n\n00:08:09.958 --> 00:08:11.958\nAnd I was supposed to do this alone.\n\n00:08:11.958 --> 00:08:13.958\nBut a friend of mine, called Emmanuel,\n\n00:08:13.958 --> 00:08:15.958\nwho was significantly older than me,\n\n00:08:15.958 --> 00:08:17.958\nwho'd been a boy soldier during the Biafran war,\n\n00:08:17.958 --> 00:08:20.958\ndecided to come with me.\n\n00:08:20.958 --> 00:08:23.958\nWhich sort of made me feel good,\n\n00:08:23.958 --> 00:08:25.958\nbecause he'd seen a lot of things.\n\n00:08:25.958 --> 00:08:27.958\nNow, when I was growing up, he used to tell me\n\n00:08:27.958 --> 00:08:29.958\nstories about how he used to bayonet people,\n\n00:08:29.958 --> 00:08:32.958\nand their intestines would fall out, but they would keep running.\n\n00:08:32.958 --> 00:08:35.958\nSo, this guy comes with me.\n\n00:08:35.958 --> 00:08:38.958\nAnd I don't know if you've ever heard a goat, or seen one --\n\n00:08:38.958 --> 00:08:40.958\nthey sound like human beings,\n\n00:08:40.958 --> 00:08:43.958\nthat's why we call tragedies \"a song of a goat.\"\n\n00:08:43.958 --> 00:08:48.958\nMy friend Brad Kessler says that we didn't become human\n\n00:08:48.958 --> 00:08:50.958\nuntil we started keeping goats.\n\n00:08:50.958 --> 00:08:55.958\nAnyway, a goat's eyes are like a child's eyes.\n\n00:08:55.958 --> 00:08:57.958\nSo when I tried to kill this goat and I couldn't,\n\n00:08:57.958 --> 00:09:02.958\nEmmanuel bent down, he puts his hand over the mouth of the goat,\n\n00:09:02.958 --> 00:09:05.958\ncovers its eyes, so I don't have to look into them,\n\n00:09:05.958 --> 00:09:07.958\nwhile I kill the goat.\n\n00:09:08.958 --> 00:09:12.958\nIt didn't seem like a lot, for this guy who'd seen so much,\n\n00:09:12.958 --> 00:09:14.958\nand to whom the killing of a goat must have seemed\n\n00:09:14.958 --> 00:09:16.958\nsuch a quotidian experience,\n\n00:09:16.958 --> 00:09:20.958\nstill found it in himself to try to protect me.\n\n00:09:22.958 --> 00:09:24.958\nI was a wimp.\n\n00:09:24.958 --> 00:09:26.958\nI cried for a very long time.\n\n00:09:26.958 --> 00:09:28.958\nAnd afterwards, he didn't say a word.\n\n00:09:28.958 --> 00:09:30.958\nHe just sat there watching me cry for an hour.\n\n00:09:30.958 --> 00:09:32.958\nAnd then afterwards he said to me,\n\n00:09:32.958 --> 00:09:37.958\n\"It will always be difficult, but if you cry like this every time,\n\n00:09:37.958 --> 00:09:39.958\nyou will die of heartbreak.\n\n00:09:39.958 --> 00:09:42.958\nJust know that it is enough sometimes\n\n00:09:42.958 --> 00:09:45.958\nto know that it is difficult.\"\n\n00:09:47.958 --> 00:09:50.958\nOf course, talking about goats makes me think of sheep,\n\n00:09:50.958 --> 00:09:52.958\nand not in good ways.\n\n00:09:52.958 --> 00:09:54.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:09:54.958 --> 00:09:58.958\nSo, I was born two days after Christmas.\n\n00:09:58.958 --> 00:10:01.958\nSo growing up, you know, I had a cake and everything,\n\n00:10:01.958 --> 00:10:05.958\nbut I never got any presents, because, born two days after Christmas.\n\n00:10:06.958 --> 00:10:09.958\nSo, I was about nine, and my uncle had just come back from Germany,\n\n00:10:09.958 --> 00:10:12.958\nand we had the Catholic priest over,\n\n00:10:12.958 --> 00:10:14.958\nmy mother was entertaining him with tea.\n\n00:10:14.958 --> 00:10:18.958\nAnd my uncle suddenly says, \"Where are Chris' presents?\"\n\n00:10:18.958 --> 00:10:22.958\nAnd my mother said, \"Don't talk about that in front of guests.\"\n\n00:10:22.958 --> 00:10:25.958\nBut he was desperate to show that he'd just come back,\n\n00:10:25.958 --> 00:10:27.958\nso he summoned me up, and he said,\n\n00:10:27.958 --> 00:10:29.958\n\"Go into the bedroom, my bedroom.\n\n00:10:29.958 --> 00:10:31.958\nTake anything you want out of the suitcase.\n\n00:10:31.958 --> 00:10:33.958\nIt's your birthday present.\"\n\n00:10:33.958 --> 00:10:35.958\nI'm sure he thought I'd take a book or a shirt,\n\n00:10:35.958 --> 00:10:38.958\nbut I found an inflatable sheep.\n\n00:10:38.958 --> 00:10:44.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:10:44.958 --> 00:10:46.958\nSo, I blew it up and ran into the living room,\n\n00:10:46.958 --> 00:10:48.958\nmy finger where it shouldn't have been,\n\n00:10:48.958 --> 00:10:51.958\nI was waving this buzzing sheep around,\n\n00:10:51.958 --> 00:10:54.958\nand my mother looked like she was going to die of shock.\n\n00:10:54.958 --> 00:10:56.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:10:57.958 --> 00:11:00.958\nAnd Father McGetrick was completely unflustered,\n\n00:11:00.958 --> 00:11:02.958\njust stirred his tea and looked at my mother and said,\n\n00:11:02.958 --> 00:11:05.958\n\"It's all right Daphne, I'm Scottish.\"\n\n00:11:05.958 --> 00:11:07.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:11:07.958 --> 00:11:21.958\n(Applause)\n\n00:11:21.958 --> 00:11:27.958\nMy last days in prison, the last 18 months,\n\n00:11:27.958 --> 00:11:31.958\nmy cellmate -- for the last year, the first year of the last 18 months --\n\n00:11:31.958 --> 00:11:34.958\nmy cellmate was 14 years old.\n\n00:11:34.958 --> 00:11:37.958\nThe name was John James,\n\n00:11:37.958 --> 00:11:41.958\nand in those days, if a family member committed a crime,\n\n00:11:41.958 --> 00:11:44.958\nthe military would hold you as ransom\n\n00:11:44.958 --> 00:11:46.958\ntill your family turned themselves in.\n\n00:11:46.958 --> 00:11:49.958\nSo, here was this 14-year-old kid on death row.\n\n00:11:49.958 --> 00:11:51.958\nAnd not everybody on death row was a political prisoner.\n\n00:11:51.958 --> 00:11:54.958\nThere were some really bad people there.\n\n00:11:54.958 --> 00:11:57.958\nAnd he had smuggled in two comics, two comic books --\n\n00:11:57.958 --> 00:11:59.958\n\"Spiderman\" and \"X-Men.\"\n\n00:11:59.958 --> 00:12:00.958\nHe was obsessed.\n\n00:12:00.958 --> 00:12:02.958\nAnd when he got tired of reading them,\n\n00:12:02.958 --> 00:12:06.958\nhe started to teach the men in death row how to read,\n\n00:12:06.958 --> 00:12:08.958\nwith these comic books.\n\n00:12:08.958 --> 00:12:12.958\nAnd so, I remember night after night,\n\n00:12:12.958 --> 00:12:14.958\nyou'd hear all these men, these really hardened criminals,\n\n00:12:14.958 --> 00:12:19.958\nhuddled around John James, reciting, \"Take that, Spidey!\"\n\n00:12:19.958 --> 00:12:21.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:12:21.958 --> 00:12:23.958\nIt's incredible.\n\n00:12:24.958 --> 00:12:26.958\nI was really worried.\n\n00:12:26.958 --> 00:12:28.958\nHe didn't know what death row meant.\n\n00:12:28.958 --> 00:12:30.958\nI'd been there twice,\n\n00:12:30.958 --> 00:12:32.958\nand I was terribly afraid that I was going to die.\n\n00:12:32.958 --> 00:12:34.958\nAnd he would always laugh, and say,\n\n00:12:34.958 --> 00:12:36.958\n\"Come on, man, we'll make it out.\"\n\n00:12:36.958 --> 00:12:38.958\nThen I'd say, \"How do you know?\"\n\n00:12:38.958 --> 00:12:41.958\nAnd he said, \"Oh, I heard it on the grapevine.\"\n\n00:12:42.958 --> 00:12:44.958\nThey killed him.\n\n00:12:44.958 --> 00:12:47.958\nThey handcuffed him to a chair,\n\n00:12:47.958 --> 00:12:52.958\nand they tacked his penis to a table with a six-inch nail,\n\n00:12:53.958 --> 00:12:56.958\nthen left him there to bleed to death.\n\n00:12:56.958 --> 00:13:04.958\nThat's how I ended up in solitary, because I let my feelings be known.\n\n00:13:05.958 --> 00:13:10.958\nAll around us, everywhere, there are people like this.\n\n00:13:10.958 --> 00:13:16.958\nThe Igbo used to say that they built their own gods.\n\n00:13:16.958 --> 00:13:18.958\nThey would come together as a community,\n\n00:13:18.958 --> 00:13:21.958\nand they would express a wish.\n\n00:13:21.958 --> 00:13:23.958\nAnd their wish would then be brought to a priest,\n\n00:13:23.958 --> 00:13:26.958\nwho would find a ritual object,\n\n00:13:26.958 --> 00:13:28.958\nand the appropriate sacrifices would be made,\n\n00:13:28.958 --> 00:13:31.958\nand the shrine would be built for the god.\n\n00:13:31.958 --> 00:13:36.958\nBut if the god became unruly and began to ask for human sacrifice,\n\n00:13:36.958 --> 00:13:38.958\nthe Igbos would destroy the god.\n\n00:13:38.958 --> 00:13:41.958\nThey would knock down the shrine,\n\n00:13:41.958 --> 00:13:43.958\nand they would stop saying the god's name.\n\n00:13:43.958 --> 00:13:48.958\nThis is how they came to reclaim their humanity.\n\n00:13:48.958 --> 00:13:50.958\nEvery day, all of us here,\n\n00:13:50.958 --> 00:13:53.958\nwe're building gods that have gone rampant,\n\n00:13:53.958 --> 00:13:56.958\nand it's time we started knocking them down\n\n00:13:56.958 --> 00:13:58.958\nand forgetting their names.\n\n00:13:59.958 --> 00:14:02.958\nIt doesn't require a tremendous thing.\n\n00:14:02.958 --> 00:14:06.958\nAll it requires is to recognize among us, every day --\n\n00:14:06.958 --> 00:14:09.958\nthe few of us that can see -- are surrounded by people\n\n00:14:09.958 --> 00:14:12.958\nlike the ones I've told you.\n\n00:14:12.958 --> 00:14:15.958\nThere are some of you in this room, amazing people,\n\n00:14:15.958 --> 00:14:20.958\nwho offer all of us the mirror to our own humanity.\n\n00:14:21.958 --> 00:14:26.958\nI want to end with a poem by an American poet called Lucille Clifton.\n\n00:14:26.958 --> 00:14:31.958\nThe poem is called \"Libation,\" and it's for my friend Vusi\n\n00:14:31.958 --> 00:14:33.958\nwho is in the audience here somewhere.\n\n00:14:35.958 --> 00:14:37.958\n\"Libation,\n\n00:14:37.958 --> 00:14:40.958\nNorth Carolina, 1999.\n\n00:14:40.958 --> 00:14:46.958\nI offer to this ground, this gin.\n\n00:14:47.958 --> 00:14:50.958\nI imagine an old man crying here,\n\n00:14:50.958 --> 00:14:54.958\nout of the sight of the overseer.\n\n00:14:54.958 --> 00:14:57.958\nHe pushes his tongue through a hole\n\n00:14:57.958 --> 00:15:01.958\nwhere his tooth would be, if he were whole.\n\n00:15:02.958 --> 00:15:06.958\nIt aches in that space where his tooth would be,\n\n00:15:06.958 --> 00:15:09.958\nwhere his land would be,\n\n00:15:09.958 --> 00:15:15.958\nhis house, his wife, his son, his beautiful daughter.\n\n00:15:15.958 --> 00:15:20.958\nHe wipes sorrow from his face,\n\n00:15:20.958 --> 00:15:24.958\nand puts his thirsty finger to his thirsty tongue,\n\n00:15:24.958 --> 00:15:27.958\nand tastes the salt.\n\n00:15:30.958 --> 00:15:32.958\nI call a name that could be his.\n\n00:15:32.958 --> 00:15:36.958\nThis is for you, old man.\n\n00:15:37.958 --> 00:15:41.958\nThis gin, this salty

"https://www.ted.com/talks/louise_leakey_digs_for_humanity_s_origins", "transcript": "Who are we? That is the big question. And essentially we are just an upright-walking, big-brained, super-intelligent ape. This could be us. We belong to the family called the Hominidae. We are the species called Homo sapiens sapiens, and it's important to remember that, in terms of our place in the world today and our future on planet Earth.We are one species of about five and a half thousand mammalian species that exist on planet Earth today. And that's just a tiny fraction of all species that have ever lived on the planet in past times. We're one species out of approximately, or let's say, at least 16 upright-walking apes that have existed over the past six to eight million years. But as far as we know, we're the only upright-walking ape that exists on planet Earth today, except for the bonobos.And it's important to remember that, because the bonobos are so human, and they share 99 percent of their genes with us. And we share our origins with a handful of the living great apes. It's important to remember that we evolved. Now, I know that's a dirty word for some people, but we evolved from common ancestors with the gorillas, the chimpanzee and also the bonobos. We have a common past, and we have a common future. And it is important to remember that all of these great apes have come on as long and as interesting evolutionary journey as we ourselves have today. And it's this journey that is of such interest to humanity, and it's this journey that has been the focus of the past three generations of my family, as we've been in East Africa looking for the fossil remains of our ancestors to try and piece together our evolutionary past.And this is how we look for them. A group of dedicated young men and women walk very slowly out across vast areas of Africa, looking for small fragments of bone, fossil bone, that may be on the surface. And that's an example of what we may do as we walk across the landscape in Northern Kenya, looking for fossils. I doubt many of you in the audience can see the fossil that's in this picture, but if you look very carefully, there is a jaw, a lower jaw, of a 4.1-million-year-old upright-walking ape as it was found at Lake Turkana on the west side. (Laughter) It's extremely time-consuming, labor-intensive and it is something that is going to involve a lot more people, to begin to piece together our past. We still really haven't got a very complete picture of it.When we find a fossil, we mark it. Today, we've got great technology: we have GPS. We mark it with a GPS fix, and we also take a digital photograph of the specimen, so we could essentially put it back on the surface, exactly where we found it. And we can bring all this information into big GIS packages, today. When we then find something very important, like the bones of a human ancestor, we begin to excavate it extremely carefully and slowly, using dental picks and fine paintbrushes. And all the sediment is then put through these screens, and where we go again through it very carefully, looking for small bone fragments, and it's then washed.And these things are so exciting. They are so often the only, or the very first time that anybody has ever seen the remains. And here's a very special moment, when my mother and myself were digging up some remains of human ancestors. And it is one of the most special things to ever do with your mother. (Laughter) Not many people can say that.But now, let me take you back to Africa, two million years ago. I'd just like to point out, if you look at the map of Africa, it does actually look like a hominid skull in its shape. Now we're going to go to the East African and the Rift Valley. It essentially runs up from the Gulf of Aden, or runs down to Lake Malawi. And the Rift Valley is a depression. It's a basin, and rivers flow down from the highlands into the basin, carrying sediment, preserving the bones of animals that lived there.If you want to become a fossil, you actually need to die somewhere where your bones will be rapidly buried. You then hope that the earth moves in such a way as to bring the bones back up to the surface. And then you hope that one of us lot will walk around and find small pieces of you. (Laughter) OK, so it is absolutely surprising that we know as much as we do know today about our ancestors, because it's incredibly difficult, A, for these things to become \u2014 to be \u2014 preserved, and secondly, for them to have been brought back up to the surface. And we really have only spent 50 years looking for these remains, and begin to actually piece together our evolutionary story.So, let's go to Lake Turkana, which is one such lake basin in the very north of our country, Kenya. And if you look north here, there's a big river that flows into the lake that's been carrying sediment and preserving the remains of the animals that lived there. Fossil sites run up and down both lengths of that lake basin, which represents some 20,000 square miles. That's a huge job that we've got on our hands. Two million years ago at Lake Turkana, Homo erectus, one of our human ancestors, actually lived in this region. You can see some of the major fossil sites that we've been working in the north. But, essentially, two million years ago, Homo erectus, up in the far right corner, lived alongside three other species of human ancestor. And here is a skull of a Homo erectus, which I just pulled off the shelf there. (Laughter)But it is not to say that being a single species on planet Earth is the norm. In fact, if you go back in time, it is the norm that there are multiple species of hominids or of human ancestors that coexist at any one time. Where did these things come from? That's what we're still trying to find answers to, and it is important to realize that there is diversity in all different species, and our ancestors are no exception. Here's some reconstructions of some of the fossils that have been found from Lake Turkana.But I was very lucky to have been brought up in Kenya, essentially accompanying my parents to Lake Turkana in search of human remains. And we were able to dig up, when we got old enough, fossils such as this, a slender-snouted crocodile. And we dug up giant tortoises, and elephants and things like that. But when I was 12, as I was in this picture, a very exciting expedition was in place on the west side, when they found essentially the skeleton of this Homo erectus.I could relate to this Homo erectus skeleton very well, because I was the same age that he was when he died. And I imagined him to be tall, dark-skinned. His brothers certainly were able to run long distances chasing prey, probably sweating heavily as they did so. He was very able to use stones effectively as tools. And this individual himself, this one that I'm holding up here, actually had a bad back. He'd probably had an injury as a child. He had a scoliosis and therefore must have been looked after quite carefully by other female, and probably much smaller, members of his family group, to have got to where he did in life, age 12. Unfortunately for him, he fell into a swamp and couldn't get out. Essentially, his bones were rapidly buried and beautifully preserved.And he remained there until 1.6 million years later, when this very famous fossil hunter, Kamoya Kimeu, walked along a small hillside and found that small piece of his skull lying on the surface amongst the pebbles, recognized it as being hominid. It's actually this little piece up here on the top. Well, an excavation was begun immediately, and more and more little bits of skull started to be extracted from the sediment. And what was so fun about it was this: the skull pieces got closer and closer to the roots of the tree, and fairly recently the tree had grown up, but it had found that the skull had captured nice water in the hillside, and so it had decided to grow its roots in and around this, holding it in place and preventing it from washing away down the slope. We began to find limb bones; we found finger bones, the bones of the pelvis, vertebrae, ribs, the collar bones, things that had never, ever been seen before in Homo erectus. It was truly exciting. He had a body very similar to our own, and he was on the threshold of becoming human.Well, shortly afterwards, members of his species started to move northwards out of Africa, and you start to see fossils of Homo erectus in Georgia, China and also in parts of Indonesia. So, Homo erectus was the first human ancestor to leave Africa and begin its spread across the globe. Some exciting finds, again, as I mentioned, from Dmanisi, in the Republic of Georgia. But also, surprising finds recently announced from the Island of Flores in Indonesia, where a group of these human ancestors have been isolated, and have become dwarfed, and they're only about a meter in height. But they lived only 18,000 years ago, and that is truly extraordinary to think about.Just to put this in terms of generations, because people do find it hard to think of time, Homo erectus left Africa 90,000 generations ago. We evolved essentially from an African stock. Again, at about 200,000 years as a fully-fledged us. And we only left Africa about 70,000 years ago. And until 30,000 years ago, at least three upright-walking apes shared the planet Earth.The question now is, well, who are we? We're certainly a polluting, wasteful, aggressive species, with a few nice things thrown in, perhaps. (Laughter) For the most part, we're not particularly pleasant at all. We have a much larger brain than our ape ancestors. Is this a good evolutionary adaptation, or is it going to lead us to being the shortest-lived hominid species on planet Earth?And what is it that really makes us us? I think it's our collective intelligence. It's our ability to write things down, our language and our consciousness. From very primitive beginnings, with a very crude tool kit of stones, we now have a very advanced tool kit, and our tool use has really reached unprecedented levels: we've got buggies to Mars; we've mapped the human genome; and recently even created synthetic life, thanks to Craig Venter.And we've also managed to communicate with people all over the world, from extraordinary places. Even from within an excavation in northern Kenya, we can talk to people about what we're doing. As Al Gore so clearly has reminded us, we have reached extraordinary numbers of people on this planet. Human ancestors really only survive on planet Earth, if you look at the fossil record, for about, on average, a million years at a time. We've only been around for the past 200,000 years as a species, yet we've reached a population of more than six and a half billion people.And last year, our population grew by 80 million. I mean, these are extraordinary numbers. You can see here, again, taken from Al Gore's book. But what's happened is our technology has removed the checks and balances on our population growth. We have to control our numbers, and I think this is as important as anything else that's being done in the world today. But we have to control our numbers, because we can't really hold it together as a species.My father so appropriately put it, that \"We are certainly the only animal that makes conscious choices that are bad for our survival as a species.\" Can we hold it together? It's important to remember that we all evolved in Africa. We all have an African origin. We have a common past and we share a common future. Evolutionarily speaking, we're just a blip. We're sitting on the edge of a precipice, and we have the tools and the technology at our hands to communicate what needs to be done to hold it together today. We could tell every single human being out there, if we really wanted to. But will we do that, or will we just let nature take its course?Well, to end on a very positive note, I think evolutionarily speaking, this is probably a fairly good thing, in the end. I'll leave it at that, thank you very much.

Earth today.\n\n00:00:50.958 --> 00:00:53.958\nAnd that's just a tiny fraction of all species\n\n00:00:53.958 --> 00:00:56.958\nthat have ever lived on the planet in past times.\n\n00:00:57.958 --> 00:01:00.958\nWe're one species out of approximately,\n\n00:01:00.958 --> 00:01:04.958\nor let's say, at least 16 upright-walking apes\n\n00:01:04.958 --> 00:01:07.958\nthat have existed over the past six to eight million years.\n\n00:01:07.958 --> 00:01:10.958\nBut as far as we know, we're the only upright-walking ape\n\n00:01:10.958 --> 00:01:13.958\nthat exists on planet Earth today, except for the bonobos.\n\n00:01:13.958 --> 00:01:15.958\nAnd it's important to remember that,\n\n00:01:15.958 --> 00:01:17.958\nbecause the bonobos are so human,\n\n00:01:17.958 --> 00:01:22.958\nand they share 99 percent of their genes with us.\n\n00:01:22.958 --> 00:01:26.958\nAnd we share our origins with a handful of the living great apes.\n\n00:01:26.958 --> 00:01:30.958\nIt's important to remember that we evolved.\n\n00:01:30.958 --> 00:01:32.958\nNow, I know that's a dirty word for some people,\n\n00:01:32.958 --> 00:01:37.958\nbut we evolved from common ancestors\n\n00:01:37.958 --> 00:01:44.958\nwith the gorillas, the chimpanzee and also the bonobos.\n\n00:01:47.958 --> 00:01:51.958\nWe have a common past, and we have a common future.\n\n00:01:51.958 --> 00:01:56.958\nAnd it is important to remember that all of these great apes\n\n00:01:56.958 --> 00:02:01.958\nhave come on as long and as interesting evolutionary journey\n\n00:02:01.958 --> 00:02:04.958\nas we ourselves have today.\n\n00:02:04.958 --> 00:02:08.958\nAnd it's this journey that is of such interest to humanity,\n\n00:02:08.958 --> 00:02:11.958\nand it's this journey that has been the focus\n\n00:02:11.958 --> 00:02:14.958\nof the past three generations of my family,\n\n00:02:14.958 --> 00:02:17.958\nas we've been in East Africa looking for the fossil remains\n\n00:02:17.958 --> 00:02:22.958\nof our ancestors to try and piece together our evolutionary past.\n\n00:02:22.958 --> 00:02:24.958\nAnd this is how we look for them.\n\n00:02:24.958 --> 00:02:29.958\nA group of dedicated young men and women walk very slowly\n\n00:02:29.958 --> 00:02:32.958\nout across vast areas of Africa,\n\n00:02:32.958 --> 00:02:39.958\nlooking for small fragments of bone, fossil bone, that may be on the surface.\n\n00:02:39.958 --> 00:02:43.958\nAnd that's an example of what we may do as we walk across\n\n00:02:43.958 --> 00:02:46.958\nthe landscape in Northern Kenya, looking for fossils.\n\n00:02:46.958 --> 00:02:49.958\nI doubt many of you in the audience can see\n\n00:02:49.958 --> 00:02:52.958\nthe fossil that's in this picture,\n\n00:02:52.958 --> 00:02:55.958\nbut if you look very carefully, there is a jaw, a lower jaw,\n\n00:02:55.958 --> 00:02:58.958\nof a 4.1-million-year-old upright-walking ape\n\n00:02:58.958 --> 00:03:02.958\nas it was found at Lake Turkana on the west side.\n\n00:03:02.958 --> 00:03:05.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:03:05.958 --> 00:03:08.958\nIt's extremely time-consuming, labor-intensive\n\n00:03:08.958 --> 00:03:12.958\nand it is something that is going to involve a lot more people,\n\n00:03:12.958 --> 00:03:15.958\nto begin to piece together our past.\n\n00:03:15.958 --> 00:03:18.958\nWe still really haven't got a very complete picture of it.\n\n00:03:18.958 --> 00:03:22.958\nWhen we find a fossil, we mark it.\n\n00:03:22.958 --> 00:03:25.958\nToday, we've got great technology: we have GPS.\n\n00:03:25.958 --> 00:03:27.958\nWe mark it with a GPS fix,\n\n00:03:27.958 --> 00:03:31.958\nand we also take a digital photograph of the specimen,\n\n00:03:31.958 --> 00:03:34.958\nso we could essentially put it back on the surface,\n\n00:03:34.958 --> 00:03:36.958\nexactly where we found it.\n\n00:03:36.958 --> 00:03:40.958\nAnd we can bring all this information into big GIS packages, today.\n\n00:03:40.958 --> 00:03:44.958\nWhen we then find something very important,\n\n00:03:44.958 --> 00:03:46.958\nlike the bones of a human ancestor,\n\n00:03:46.958 --> 00:03:50.958\nwe begin to excavate it extremely carefully and slowly,\n\n00:03:50.958 --> 00:03:53.958\nusing dental picks and fine paintbrushes.\n\n00:03:53.958 --> 00:03:56.958\nAnd all the sediment is then put through these screens,\n\n00:03:56.958 --> 00:03:58.958\nand where we go again through it very carefully,\n\n00:03:58.958 --> 00:04:02.958\nlooking for small bone fragments, and it's then washed.\n\n00:04:02.958 --> 00:04:06.958\nAnd these things are so exciting. They are so often the only,\n\n00:04:06.958 --> 00:04:11.958\nor the very first time that anybody has ever seen the remains.\n\n00:04:11.958 --> 00:04:14.958\nAnd here's a very special moment, when my mother and myself\n\n00:04:14.958 --> 00:04:20.958\nwere digging up some remains of human ancestors.\n\n00:04:20.958 --> 00:04:22.958\nAnd it is one of the most special things\n\n00:04:22.958 --> 00:04:24.958\nto ever do with your mother.\n\n00:04:24.958 --> 00:04:28.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:04:28.958 --> 00:04:31.958\nNot many people can say that.\n\n00:04:31.958 --> 00:04:37.958\nBut now, let me take you back to Africa, two million years ago.\n\n00:04:37.958 --> 00:04:42.958\nI'd just like to point out, if you look at the map of Africa,\n\n00:04:42.958 --> 00:04:47.958\nit does actually look like a hominid skull in its shape.\n\n00:04:51.958 --> 00:04:55.958\nNow we're going to go to the East African and the Rift Valley.\n\n00:04:55.958 --> 00:04:58.958\nIt essentially runs up from the Gulf of Aden,\n\n00:04:58.958 --> 00:05:02.958\nor runs down to Lake Malawi.\n\n00:05:02.958 --> 00:05:04.958\nAnd the Rift Valley is a depression.\n\n00:05:04.958 --> 00:05:10.958\nIt's a basin, and rivers flow down from the highlands into the basin,\n\n00:05:11.958 --> 00:05:15.958\ncarrying sediment, preserving the bones of animals that lived there.\n\n00:05:15.958 --> 00:05:19.958\nIf you want to become a fossil, you actually need to die somewhere\n\n00:05:19.958 --> 00:05:21.958\nwhere your bones will be rapidly buried.\n\n00:05:21.958 --> 00:05:23.958\nYou then hope that the earth moves in such a way\n\n00:05:23.958 --> 00:05:26.958\nas to bring the bones back up to the surface.\n\n00:05:26.958 --> 00:05:29.958\nAnd then you hope that one of us lot\n\n00:05:29.958 --> 00:05:32.958\nwill walk around and find small pieces of you.\n\n00:05:32.958 --> 00:05:33.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:05:33.958 --> 00:05:36.958\nOK, so it is absolutely surprising that we know as much\n\n00:05:36.958 --> 00:05:39.958\nas we do know today about our ancestors,\n\n00:05:39.958 --> 00:05:41.958\nbecause it's incredibly difficult,\n\n00:05:41.958 --> 00:05:44.958\nA, for these things to become -- to be -- preserved,\n\n00:05:44.958 --> 00:05:47.958\nand secondly, for them to have been brought back up to the surface.\n\n00:05:47.958 --> 00:05:51.958\nAnd we really have only spent 50 years looking for these remains,\n\n00:05:52.958 --> 00:05:55.958\nand begin to actually piece together our evolutionary story.\n\n00:05:55.958 --> 00:06:00.958\nSo, let's go to Lake Turkana, which is one such lake basin\n\n00:06:00.958 --> 00:06:02.958\nin the very north of our country, Kenya.\n\n00:06:02.958 --> 00:06:06.958\nAnd if you look north here, there's a big river that flows into the lake\n\n00:06:06.958 --> 00:06:09.958\nthat's been carrying sediment and preserving the remains\n\n00:06:09.958 --> 00:06:11.958\nof the animals that lived there.\n\n00:06:11.958 --> 00:06:15.958\nFossil sites run up and down both lengths of that lake basin,\n\n00:06:15.958 --> 00:06:19.958\nwhich represents some 20,000 square miles.\n\n00:06:20.958 --> 00:06:22.958\nThat's a huge job that we've got on our hands.\n\n00:06:22.958 --> 00:06:26.958\nTwo million years ago at Lake Turkana,\n\n00:06:26.958 --> 00:06:29.958\nHomo erectus, one of our human ancestors,\n\n00:06:29.958 --> 00:06:31.958\nactually lived in this region.\n\n00:06:31.958 --> 00:06:34.958\nYou can see some of the major fossil sites that we've been working\n\n00:06:34.958 --> 00:06:38.958\nin the north. But, essentially, two million years ago,\n\n00:06:39.958 --> 00:06:42.958\nHomo erectus, up in the far right corner,\n\n00:06:42.958 --> 00:06:48.958\nlived alongside three other species of human ancestor.\n\n00:06:50.958 --> 00:06:53.958\nAnd here is a skull of a Homo erectus,\n\n00:06:53.958 --> 00:06:55.958\nwhich I just pulled off the shelf there.\n\n00:06:55.958 --> 00:06:59.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:06:59.958 --> 00:07:05.958\nBut it is not to say that being a single species on planet Earth is the norm.\n\n00:07:05.958 --> 00:07:07.958\nIn fact, if you go back in time,\n\n00:07:07.958 --> 00:07:12.958\nit is the norm that there are multiple species of hominids\n\n00:07:12.958 --> 00:07:14.958\nor of human ancestors that coexist at any one time.\n\n00:07:14.958 --> 00:07:17.958\nWhere did these things come from?\n\n00:07:17.958 --> 00:07:20.958\nThat's what we're still trying to find answers to,\n\n00:07:20.958 --> 00:07:24.958\nand it is important to realize that there is diversity\n\n00:07:24.958 --> 00:07:28.958\nin all different species, and our ancestors are no exception.\n\n00:07:30.958 --> 00:07:34.958\nHere's some reconstructions of some of the fossils\n\n00:07:36.958 --> 00:07:39.958\nthat have been found from Lake Turkana.\n\n00:07:39.958 --> 00:07:42.958\nBut I was very lucky to have been brought up in Kenya,\n\n00:07:42.958 --> 00:07:46.958\nessentially accompanying my parents to Lake Turkana\n\n00:07:46.958 --> 00:07:48.958\nin search of human remains.\n\n00:07:48.958 --> 00:07:51.958\nAnd we were able to dig up, when we got old enough,\n\n00:07:51.958 --> 00:07:55.958\nfossils such as this, a slender-snouted crocodile.\n\n00:07:56.958 --> 00:08:00.958\nAnd we dug up giant tortoises, and elephants and things like that.\n\n00:08:00.958 --> 00:08:02.958\nBut when I was 12, as I was in this picture,\n\n00:08:02.958 --> 00:08:06.958\na very exciting expedition was in place on the west side,\n\n00:08:06.958 --> 00:08:12.958\nwhen they found essentially the skeleton of this Homo erectus.\n\n00:08:13.958 --> 00:08:17.958\nI could relate to this Homo erectus skeleton very well,\n\n00:08:17.958 --> 00:08:22.958\nbecause I was the same age that he was when he died.\n\n00:08:23.958 --> 00:08:27.958\nAnd I imagined him to be tall, dark-skinned.\n\n00:08:27.958 --> 00:08:32.958\nHis brothers certainly were able to run long distances\n\n00:08:32.958 --> 00:08:35.958\nchasing prey, probably sweating heavily as they did so.\n\n00:08:35.958 --> 00:08:40.958\nHe was very able to use stones effectively as tools.\n\n00:08:40.958 --> 00:08:44.958\nAnd this individual himself, this one that I'm holding up here,\n\n00:08:44.958 --> 00:08:49.958\nactually had a bad back. He'd probably had an injury as a child.\n\n00:08:49.958 --> 00:08:53.958\nHe had a scoliosis and therefore must have been looked after\n\n00:08:53.958 --> 00:08:56.958\nquite carefully by other female, and probably much smaller,\n\n00:08:57.958 --> 00:09:03.958\nmembers of his family group, to have got to where he did in life, age 12.\n\n00:09:03.958 --> 00:09:06.958\nUnfortunately for him, he fell into a swamp\n\n00:09:06.958 --> 00:09:08.958\nand couldn't get out.\n\n00:09:08.958 --> 00:09:11.958\nEssentially, his bones were rapidly buried\n\n00:09:11.958 --> 00:09:13.958\nand beautifully preserved.\n\n00:09:13.958 --> 00:09:18.958\nAnd he remained there until 1.6 million years later,\n\n00:09:18.958 --> 00:09:22.958\nwhen this very famous fossil hunter, Kamoya Kimeu,\n\n00:09:22.958 --> 00:09:24.958\nwalked along a small hillside\n\n00:09:25.958 --> 00:09:29.958\nand found that small piece of his skull lying on the surface\n\n00:09:29.958 --> 00:09:33.958\namongst the pebbles, recognized it as being hominid.\n\n00:09:35.958 --> 00:09:37.958\nIt's actually this little piece up here on the top.\n\n00:09:37.958 --> 00:09:41.958\nWell, an excavation was begun immediately,\n\n00:09:41.958 --> 00:09:43.958\nand more and more little bits of skull\n\n00:09:43.958 --> 00:09:47.958\nstarted to be extracted from the sediment.\n\n00:09:47.958 --> 00:09:49.958\nAnd what was so fun about it was this:\n\n00:09:49.958 --> 00:09:54.958\nthe skull pieces got closer and closer to the roots of the tree,\n\n00:09:55.958 --> 00:09:57.958\nand fairly recently the tree had grown up,\n\n00:09:57.958 --> 00:10:02.958\nbut it had found that the skull had captured nice water in the hillside,\n\n00:10:02.958 --> 00:10:05.958\nand so it had decided to grow its roots in and around this,\n\n00:10:05.958 --> 00:10:10.958\nholding it in place and preventing it from washing away down the slope.\n\n00:10:10.958 --> 00:10:15.958\nWe began to find limb bones; we found finger bones,\n\n00:10:15.958 --> 00:10:18.958\nthe bones of the pelvis, vertebrae, ribs, the collar bones,\n\n00:10:18.958 --> 00:10:23.958\nthings that had never, ever been seen before in Homo erectus.\n\n00:10:23.958 --> 00:10:25.958\nIt was truly exciting.\n\n00:10:25.958 --> 00:10:30.958\nHe had a body very similar to our own,\n\n00:10:30.958 --> 00:10:34.958\nand he was on the threshold of becoming human.\n\n00:10:34.958 --> 00:10:38.958\nWell, shortly afterwards, members of his species\n\n00:10:38.958 --> 00:10:41.958\nstarted to move northwards out of Africa,\n\n00:10:41.958 --> 00:10:44.958\nand you start to see fossils of Homo erectus\n\n00:10:44.958 --> 00:10:50.958\nin Georgia, China and also in parts of Indonesia.\n\n00:10:50.958 --> 00:10:55.958\nSo, Homo erectus was the first human ancestor to leave Africa\n\n00:10:55.958 --> 00:10:57.958\nand begin its spread across the globe.\n\n00:10:57.958 --> 00:11:02.958\nSome exciting finds, again, as I mentioned,\n\n00:11:02.958 --> 00:11:05.958\nfrom Dmanisi, in the Republic of Georgia.\n\n00:11:05.958 --> 00:11:07.958\nBut also, surprising finds\n\n00:11:07.958 --> 00:11:10.958\nrecently announced from the Island of Flores in Indonesia,\n\n00:11:10.958 --> 00:11:15.958\nwhere a group of these human ancestors have been isolated,\n\n00:11:15.958 --> 00:11:19.958\nand have become dwarfed, and they're only about a meter in height.\n\n00:11:19.958 --> 00:11:23.958\nBut they lived only 18,000 years ago,\n\n00:11:23.958 --> 00:11:26.958\nand that is truly extraordinary to think about.\n\n00:11:26.958 --> 00:11:29.958\nJust to put this in terms of generations,\n\n00:11:29.958 --> 00:11:31.958\nbecause people do find it hard to think of time,\n\n00:11:31.958 --> 00:11:35.958\nHomo erectus left Africa 90,000 generations ago.\n\n00:11:36.958 --> 00:11:39.958\nWe evolved essentially from an African stock.\n\n00:11:39.958 --> 00:11:44.958\nAgain, at about 200,000 years as a fully-fledged us.\n\n00:11:44.958 --> 00:11:48.958\nAnd we only left Africa about 70,000 years ago.\n\n00:11:48.958 --> 00:11:53.958\nAnd until 30,000 years ago, at least three upright-walking apes\n\n00:11:53.958 --> 00:11:55.958\nshared the planet Earth.\n\n00:11:55.958 --> 00:11:58.958\nThe question now is, well, who are we?\n\n00:11:58.958 --> 00:12:03.958\nWe're certainly a polluting, wasteful, aggressive species,\n\n00:12:03.958 --> 00:12:06.958\nwith a few nice things thrown in, perhaps.\n\n00:12:06.958 --> 00:12:07.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:12:07.958 --> 00:12:13.958\nFor the most part, we're not particularly pleasant at all.\n\n00:12:13.958 --> 00:12:16.958\nWe have a much larger brain than our ape ancestors.\n\n00:12:16.958 --> 00:12:22.958\nIs this a good evolutionary adaptation, or is it going to lead us\n\n00:12:22.958 --> 00:12:27.958\nto being the shortest-lived hominid species on planet Earth?\n\n00:12:27.958 --> 00:12:30.958\nAnd what is it that really makes us us?\n\n00:12:30.958 --> 00:12:32.958\nI think it's our collective intelligence.\n\n00:12:32.958 --> 00:12:35.958\nIt's our ability to write things down,\n\n00:12:35.958 --> 00:12:37.958\nour language and our consciousness.\n\n00:12:37.958 --> 00:12:44.958\nFrom very primitive beginnings, with a very crude tool kit of stones,\n\n00:12:44.958 --> 00:12:49.958\nwe now have a very advanced tool kit, and our tool use\n\n00:12:49.958 --> 00:12:52.958\nhas really reached unprecedented levels:\n\n00:12:52.958 --> 00:12:56.958\nwe've got buggies to Mars; we've mapped the human genome;\n\n00:12:56.958 --> 00:13:00.958\nand recently even created synthetic life, thanks to Craig Venter.\n\n00:13:00.958 --> 00:13:04.958\nAnd we've also managed to communicate with people\n\n00:13:04.958 --> 00:13:07.958\nall over the world, from extraordinary places.\n\n00:13:07.958 --> 00:13:11.958\nEven from within an excavation in northern Kenya,\n\n00:13:11.958 --> 00:13:13.958\nwe can talk to people about what we're doing.\n\n00:13:13.958 --> 00:13:17.958\nAs Al Gore so clearly has reminded us,\n\n00:13:17.958 --> 00:13:21.958\nwe have reached extraordinary numbers\n\n00:13:21.958 --> 00:13:23.958\nof people on this planet.\n\n00:13:23.958 --> 00:13:26.958\nHuman ancestors really only survive on planet Earth,\n\n00:13:26.958 --> 00:13:28.958\nif you look at the fossil record,\n\n00:13:28.958 --> 00:13:31.958\nfor about, on average, a million years at a time.\n\n00:13:31.958 --> 00:13:35.958\nWe've only been around for the past 200,000 years as a species,\n\n00:13:35.958 --> 00:13:40.958\nyet we've reached a population of more than six and a half billion people.\n\n00:13:40.958 --> 00:13:43.958\nAnd last year, our population grew by 80 million.\n\n00:13:43.958 --> 00:13:46.958\nI mean, these are extraordinary numbers.\n\n00:13:46.958 --> 00:13:51.958\nYou can see here, again, taken from Al Gore's book.\n\n00:13:51.958 --> 00:13:53.958\nBut what's happened is our technology\n\n00:13:53.958 --> 00:13:57.958\nhas removed the checks and balances on our population growth.\n\n00:13:58.958 --> 00:14:02.958\nWe have to control our numbers, and I think this is as important\n\n00:14:02.958 --> 00:14:04.958\nas anything else that's being done in the world today.\n\n00:14:04.958 --> 00:14:06.958\nBut we have to control our numbers,\n\n00:14:06.958 --> 00:14:10.958\nbecause we can't really hold it together as a species.\n\n00:14:11.958 --> 00:14:14.958\nMy father so appropriately put it,\n\n00:14:14.958 --> 00:14:18.958\nthat \"We are certainly the only animal that makes conscious choices\n\n00:14:18.958 --> 00:14:20.958\nthat are bad for our survival as a species.\"\n\n00:14:20.958 --> 00:14:23.958\nCan we hold it together?\n\n00:14:26.958 --> 00:14:30.958\nIt's important to remember that we all evolved in Africa.\n\n00:14:30.958 --> 00:14:33.958\nWe all have an African origin.\n\n00:14:34.958 --> 00:14:38.958\nWe have a common past and we share a common future.\n\n00:14:38.958 --> 00:14:42.958\nEvolutionarily speaking, we're just a blip.\n\n00:14:42.958 --> 00:14:45.958\nWe're sitting on the edge of a precipice,\n\n00:14:45.958 --> 00:14:52.958\nand we have the tools and the technology at our hands\n\n00:14:52.958 --> 00:14:54.958\nto communicate what needs to be done\n\n00:14:54.958 --> 00:14:56.958\nto hold it together today.\n\n00:14:58.958 --> 00:15:01.958\nWe could tell every single human being out there, if we really wanted to.\n\n00:15:01.958 --> 00:15:07.958\nBut will we do that, or will we just let nature take its course?\n\n00:15:08.958 --> 00:15:11.958\nWell, to end on a very positive note,\n\n00:15:11.958 --> 00:15:13.958\nI think evolutionarily speaking,\n\n00:15:13.958 --> 00:15:16.958\nthis is probably a fairly good thing, in the end.\n\n00:15:16.958 --> 00:15:18.958\nI'll leave it at that, thank you very much.\n\n00:15:18.958 --> 00:15:23.958\n(Applause)"}, {"title": "The web as art", "duration": "1229", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/jonathan_harris_collects_stories", "transcript": "So I'm going to talk today about collecting stories in some unconventional ways. This is a picture of me from a very awkward stage in my life. You might enjoy the awkwardly tight, cut-off pajama bottoms with balloons. Anyway, it was a time when I was mainly interested in collecting imaginary stories. So this is a picture of me holding one of the first watercolor paintings I ever made. And recently I've been much more interested in collecting stories from reality \u2014 so, real stories. And specifically, I'm interested in collecting my own stories, stories from the Internet, and then recently, stories from life, which is kind of a new area of work that I've been doing recently. So I'll be talking about each of those today. So, first of all, my own stories. These are two of my sketchbooks. I have many of these books, and I've been keeping them for about the last eight or nine years. They accompany me wherever I go in my life, and I fill them with all sorts of things, records of my lived experience: so watercolor paintings, drawings of what I see, dead flowers, dead insects, pasted ticket stubs, rusting coins, business cards, writings. And in these books, you can find these short, little glimpses of moments and experiences and people that I meet. And, you know, after keeping these books for a number of years, I started to become very interested in collecting not only my own personal artifacts, but also the artifacts of other people. So, I started collecting found objects. This is a photograph I found lying in a gutter in New York City about 10 years ago. On the front, you can see the tattered black-and-white photo of a woman's face, and on the back it says, \"To Judy, the girl with the Bill Bailey voice. Have fun in whatever you do.\" And I really loved this idea of the partial glimpse into somebody's life. As opposed to knowing the whole story, just knowing a little bit of the story, and then letting your own mind fill in the rest. And that idea of a partial glimpse is something that will come back in a lot of the work I'll be showing later today. So, around this time I was studying computer science at Princeton University, and I noticed that it was suddenly possible to collect these sorts of personal artifacts, not just from street corners, but also from the Internet. And that suddenly, people, en masse, were leaving scores and scores of digital footprints online that told stories of their private lives. Blog posts, photographs, thoughts, feelings, opinions, all of these things were being expressed by people online, and leaving behind trails. So, I started to write computer programs that study very, very large sets of these online footprints. One such project is about a year and a half old. It's called \"We Feel Fine.\" This is a project that scans the world's newly posted blog entries every two or three minutes, searching for occurrences of the phrases \"I feel\" and \"I am feeling.\" And when it finds one of those phrases, it grabs the full sentence up to the period and also tries to identify demographic information about the author. So, their gender, their age, their geographic location and what the weather conditions were like when they wrote that sentence. It collects about 20,000 such sentences a day and it's been running for about a year and a half, having collected over 10 and a half million feelings now. This is, then, how they're presented. These dots here represent some of the English-speaking world's feelings from the last few hours, each dot being a single sentence stated by a single blogger. And the color of each dot corresponds to the type of feeling inside, so the bright ones are happy, and the dark ones are sad. And the diameter of each dot corresponds to the length of the sentence inside. So the small ones are short, and the bigger ones are longer. \"I feel fine with the body I'm in, there'll be no easy excuse for why I still feel uncomfortable being close to my boyfriend,\" from a twenty-two-year-old in Japan. \"I got this on some trading locally, but really don't feel like screwing with wiring and crap.\" Also, some of the feelings contain photographs in the blog posts. And when that happens, these montage compositions are automatically created, which consist of the sentence and images being combined. And any of these can be opened up to reveal the sentence inside. \"I feel good.\" \"I feel rough now, and I probably gained 100,000 pounds, but it was worth it.\" \"I love how they were able to preserve most in everything that makes you feel close to nature \u2014 butterflies, man-made forests, limestone caves and hey, even a huge python.\" So the next movement is called mobs. This provides a slightly more statistical look at things. This is showing the world's most common feelings overall right now, dominated by better, then bad, then good, then guilty, and so on. Weather causes the feelings to assume the physical traits of the weather they represent. So the sunny ones swirl around, the cloudy ones float along, the rainy ones fall down, and the snowy ones flutter to the ground. You can also stop a raindrop and open the feeling inside. Finally, location causes the feelings to move to their spots on a world map, giving you a sense of their geographic distribution. So I'll show you now some of my favorite montages from \"We Feel Fine.\" These are the images that are automatically constructed. \"I feel like I'm diagonally parked in a parallel universe.\" (Laughter) \"I've kissed numerous other boys and it hasn't felt good, the kisses felt messy and wrong, but kissing Lucas feels beautiful and almost spiritual.\" \"I can feel my cancer grow.\" \"I feel pretty.\" \"I feel skinny, but I'm not.\" \"I'm 23, and a recovering meth and heroin addict, and feel absolutely blessed to still be alive.\" \"I can't wait to see them racing for the first time at Daytona next month, because I feel the need for speed.\" (Laughter) \"I feel sassy.\" \"I feel so sexy in this new wig.\" As you can see, \"We Feel Fine\" collects very, very small-scale personal stories. Sometimes, stories as short as two or three words. So, really even challenging the notion of what can be considered a story. And recently, I've become interested in diving much more deeply into a single story. And that's led me to doing some work with the physical world, not with the Internet, and only using the Internet at the very last moment, as a presentation medium. So these are some newer projects that actually aren't even launched publicly yet. The first such one is called \"The Whale Hunt.\" Last May, I spent nine days living up in Barrow, Alaska, the northernmost settlement in the United States, with a family of Inupiat Eskimos, documenting their annual spring whale hunt. This is the whaling camp here, we're about six miles from shore, camping on five and a half feet of thick, frozen pack ice. And that water that you see there is the open lead, and through that lead, bowhead whales migrate north each springtime. And the Eskimo community basically camps out on the edge of the ice here, waits for a whale to come close enough to attack. And when it does, it throws a harpoon at it, and then hauls the whale up under the ice, and cuts it up. And that would provide the community's food supply for a long time. So I went up there, and I lived with these guys out in their whaling camp here, and photographed the entire experience, beginning with the taxi ride to Newark airport in New York, and ending with the butchering of the second whale, seven and a half days later. I photographed that entire experience at five-minute intervals. So every five minutes, I took a photograph. When I was awake, with the camera around my neck. When I was sleeping, with a tripod and a timer. And then in moments of high adrenaline, like when something exciting was happening, I would up that photographic frequency to as many as 37 photographs in five minutes. So what this created was a photographic heartbeat that sped up and slowed down, more or less matching the changing pace of my own heartbeat. That was the first concept here. The second concept was to use this experience to think about the fundamental components of any story. What are the things that make up a story? So, stories have characters. Stories have concepts. Stories take place in a certain area. They have contexts. They have colors. What do they look like? They have time. When did it take place? Dates \u2014 when did it occur? And in the case of the whale hunt, also this idea of an excitement level. The thing about stories, though, in most of the existing mediums that we're accustomed to \u2014 things like novels, radio, photographs, movies, even lectures like this one \u2014 we're very accustomed to this idea of the narrator or the camera position, some kind of omniscient, external body through whose eyes you see the story. We're very used to this. But if you think about real life, it's not like that at all. I mean, in real life, things are much more nuanced and complex, and there's all of these overlapping stories intersecting and touching each other. And so I thought it would be interesting to build a framework to surface those types of stories. So, in the case of \"The Whale Hunt,\" how could we extract something like the story of Simeon and Crawford, involving the concepts of wildlife, tools and blood, taking place on the Arctic Ocean, dominated by the color red, happening around 10 a.m. on May 3, with an excitement level of high? So, how to extract this order of narrative from this larger story? I built a web interface for viewing \"The Whale Hunt\" that attempts to do just this. So these are all 3,214 pictures taken up there. This is my studio in Brooklyn. This is the Arctic Ocean, and the butchering of the second whale, seven days later. You can start to see some of the story here, told by color. So this red strip signifies the color of the wallpaper in the basement apartment where I was staying. And things go white as we move out onto the Arctic Ocean. Introduction of red down here, when whales are being cut up. You can see a timeline, showing you the exciting moments throughout the story. These are organized chronologically. Wheel provides a slightly more playful version of the same, so these are also all the photographs organized chronologically. And any of these can be clicked, and then the narrative is entered at that position. So here I am sleeping on the airplane heading up to Alaska. That's \"Moby Dick.\" This is the food we ate. This is in the Patkotak's family living room in their house in Barrow. The boxed wine they served us. Cigarette break outside \u2014 I don't smoke. This is a really exciting sequence of me sleeping. This is out at whale camp, on the Arctic Ocean. This graph that I'm clicking down here is meant to be reminiscent of a medical heartbeat graph, showing the exciting moments of adrenaline. This is the ice starting to freeze over. The snow fence they built. And so what I'll show you now is the ability to pull out sub-stories. So, here you see the cast. These are all of the people in \"The Whale Hunt\" and the two whales that were killed down here. And we could do something as arbitrary as, say, extract the story of Rony, involving the concepts of blood and whales and tools, taking place on the Arctic Ocean, at Ahkivgaq camp, with the heartbeat level of fast. And now we've whittled down that whole story to just 29 matching photographs, and then we can enter the narrative at that position. And you can see Rony cutting up the whale here. These whales are about 40 feet long, and weighing over 40 tons. And they provide the food source for the community for much of the year. Skipping ahead a bit more here, this is Rony on the whale carcass. They use no chainsaws or anything; it's entirely just blades, and an incredibly efficient process. This is the guys on the rope, pulling open the carcass. This is the muktuk, or the blubber, all lined up for community distribution. It's baleen. Moving on. So what I'm going to tell you about next is a very new thing. It's not even a project yet. So, just yesterday, I flew in here from Singapore, and before that, I was spending two weeks in Bhutan, the small Himalayan kingdom nestled between Tibet and India. And I was doing a project there about happiness, interviewing a lot of local people. So Bhutan has this really wacky thing where they base most of their high-level governmental decisions around the concept of gross national happiness instead of gross domestic product, and they've been doing this since the '70s. And it leads to just a completely different value system. It's an incredibly non-materialistic culture, where people don't have a lot, but they're incredibly happy. So I went around and I talked to people about some of these ideas. So, I did a number of things. I asked people a number of set questions, and took a number of set photographs, and interviewed them with audio, and also took pictures. I would start by asking people to rate their happiness between one and 10, which is kind of inherently absurd. And then when they answered, I would inflate that number of balloons and give them that number of balloons to hold. So, you have some really happy person holding 10 balloons, and some really sad soul holding one balloon. But you know, even holding one balloon is like, kind of happy. (Laughter) And then I would ask them a number of questions like what was the happiest day in their life, what makes them happy. And then finally, I would ask them to make a wish. And when they made a wish, I would write their wish onto one of the balloons and take a picture of them holding it. So I'm going to show you now just a few brief snippets of some of the interviews that I did, some of the people I spoke with. This is an 11-year-old student. He was playing cops and robbers with his friends, running around town, and they all had plastic toy guns. His wish was to become a police officer. He was getting started early. Those were his hands. I took pictures of everybody's hands, because I think you can often tell a lot about somebody from how their hands look. I took a portrait of everybody, and asked everybody to make a funny face. A 17-year-old student. Her wish was to have been born a boy. She thinks that women have a pretty tough go of things in Bhutan, and it's a lot easier if you're a boy. A 28-year-old cell phone shop owner. If you knew what Paro looked like, you'd understand how amazing it is that there's a cell phone shop there. He wanted to help poor people. A 53-year-old farmer. She was chaffing wheat, and that pile of wheat behind her had taken her about a week to make. She wanted to keep farming until she dies. You can really start to see the stories told by the hands here. She was wearing this silver ring that had the word \"love\" engraved on it, and she'd found it in the road somewhere. A 16-year-old quarry worker. This guy was breaking rocks with a hammer in the hot sunlight, but he just wanted to spend his life as a farmer. A 21-year-old monk. He was very happy. He wanted to live a long life at the monastery. He had this amazing series of hairs growing out of a mole on the left side of his face, which I'm told is very good luck. He was kind of too shy to make a funny face. A 16-year-old student. She wanted to become an independent woman. I asked her about that, and she said she meant that she doesn't want to be married, because, in her opinion, when you get married in Bhutan as a woman, your chances to live an independent life kind of end, and so she had no interest in that. A 24-year-old truck driver. There are these terrifyingly huge Indian trucks that come careening around one-lane roads with two-lane traffic, with 3,000-foot drop-offs right next to the road, and he was driving one of these trucks. But all he wanted was to just live a comfortable life, like other people. A 24-year-old road sweeper. I caught her on her lunch break. She'd built a little fire to keep warm, right next to the road. Her wish was to marry someone with a car. She wanted a change in her life. She lives in a little worker's camp right next to the road, and she wanted a different lot on things. An 81-year-old itinerant farmer. I saw this guy on the side of the road, and he actually doesn't have a home. He travels from farm to farm each day trying to find work, and then he tries to sleep at whatever farm he gets work at. So his wish was to come with me, so that he had somewhere to live. He had this amazing knife that he pulled out of his gho and started brandishing when I asked him to make a funny face. It was all good-natured. A 10-year-old. He wanted to join a school and learn to read, but his parents didn't have enough money to send him to school. He was eating this orange, sugary candy that he kept dipping his fingers into, and since there was so much saliva on his hands, this orange paste started to form on his palms. (Laughter) A 37-year-old road worker. One of the more touchy political subjects in Bhutan is the use of Indian cheap labor that they import from India to build the roads, and then they send these people home once the roads are built. So these guys were in a worker's gang mixing up asphalt one morning on the side of the highway. His wish was to make some money and open a store. A 75-year-old farmer. She was selling oranges on the side of the road. I asked her about her wish, and she said, \"You know, maybe I'll live, maybe I'll die, but I don't have a wish.\" She was chewing betel nut, which caused her teeth over the years to turn very red. Finally, this is a 26-year-old nun I spoke to. Her wish was to make a pilgrimage to Tibet. I asked her how long she planned to live in the nunnery and she said, \"Well, you know, of course, it's impermanent, but my plan is to live here until I'm 30, and then enter a hermitage.\" And I said, \"You mean, like a cave?\" And she said, \"Yeah, like a cave.\" And I said, \"Wow, and how long will you live in the cave?\" And she said, \"Well, you know, I think I'd kind of like to live my whole life in the cave.\" I just thought that was amazing. I mean, she spoke in a way \u2014 with amazing English, and amazing humor, and amazing laughter \u2014 that made her seem like somebody I could have bumped into on the streets of New York, or in Vermont, where I'm from. But here she had been living in a nunnery for the last seven years. I asked her a little bit more about the cave and what she planned would happen once she went there, you know. What if she saw the truth after just one year, what would she do for the next 35 years in her life? And this is what she said. Woman: I think I'm going to stay for 35. Maybe \u2014 maybe I'll die. Jonathan Harris: Maybe you'll die? Woman: Yes. JH: 10 years? Woman: Yes, yes. JH: 10 years, that's a long time. Woman: Yes, not maybe one, 10 years, maybe I can die within one year, or something like that. JH: Are you hoping to? Woman: Ah, because you know, it's impermanent. JH: Yeah, but \u2014 yeah, OK. Do you hope \u2014 would you prefer to live in the cave for 40 years, or to live for one year? Woman: But I prefer for maybe 40 to 50. JH: 40 to 50? Yeah. Woman: Yes. From then, I'm going to the heaven. JH: Well, I wish you the best of luck with it. Woman: Thank you. JH: I hope it's everything that you hope it will be. So thank you again, so much. Woman: You're most welcome. JH: So if you caught that, she said she hoped to die when she was around 40. That was enough life for her. So, the last thing we did, very quickly, is I took all those wish balloons \u2014 there were 117 interviews, 117 wishes \u2014 and I brought them up to a place called Dochula, which is a mountain pass in Bhutan, at 10,300 feet, one of the more sacred places in Bhutan. And up there, there are thousands of prayer flags that people have spread out over the years. And we re-inflated all of the balloons, put them up on a string, and hung them up there among the prayer flags. And they're actually still flying up there today. So if any of you have any Bhutan travel plans in the near future, you can go check these out. Here are some images from that. We said a Buddhist prayer so that all these wishes could come true. You can start to see some familiar balloons here. \"To make some money and to open a store\" was the Indian road worker. Thanks very much. (Applause)", "id": 316, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:11.958 --> 00:00:15.958\nSo I'm going to talk today about collecting stories\n\n00:00:15.958 --> 00:00:17.958\nin some unconventional ways.\n\n00:00:17.958 --> 00:00:21.958\nThis is a picture of me from a very awkward stage in my life.\n\n00:00:21.958 --> 00:00:26.958\nYou might enjoy the awkwardly tight, cut-off pajama bottoms with balloons.\n\n00:00:26.958 --> 00:00:28.958\nAnyway, it was a time when I was mainly interested\n\n00:00:28.958 --> 00:00:30.958\nin collecting imaginary stories.\n\n00:00:30.958 --> 00:00:32.958\nSo this is a picture of me\n\n00:00:32.958 --> 00:00:34.958\nholding one of the first watercolor paintings I ever made.\n\n00:00:34.958 --> 00:00:37.958\nAnd recently I've been much more interested in collecting stories\n\n00:00:37.958 --> 00:00:39.958\nfrom reality -- so, real stories.\n\n00:00:39.958 --> 00:00:43.958\nAnd specifically, I'm interested in collecting my own stories,\n\n00:00:43.958 --> 00:00:46.958\nstories from the Internet, and then recently, stories from life,\n\n00:00:46.958 --> 00:00:50.958\nwhich is kind of a new area of work that I've been doing recently.\n\n00:00:50.958 --> 00:00:52.958\nSo I'll be talking about each of those today.\n\n00:00:52.958 --> 00:00:55.958\nSo, first of all, my own stories. These are two of my sketchbooks.\n\n00:00:55.958 --> 00:00:57.958\nI have many of these books,\n\n00:00:57.958 --> 00:00:59.958\nand I've been keeping them for about the last eight or nine years.\n\n00:00:59.958 --> 00:01:01.958\nThey accompany me wherever I go in my life,\n\n00:01:01.958 --> 00:01:03.958\nand I fill them with all sorts of things,\n\n00:01:03.958 --> 00:01:05.958\nrecords of my lived experience:\n\n00:01:05.958 --> 00:01:09.958\nso watercolor paintings, drawings of what I see,\n\n00:01:09.958 --> 00:01:13.958\ndead flowers, dead insects, pasted ticket stubs, rusting coins,\n\n00:01:13.958 --> 00:01:16.958\nbusiness cards, writings.\n\n00:01:16.958 --> 00:01:20.958\nAnd in these books, you can find these short, little glimpses\n\n00:01:20.958 --> 00:01:22.958\nof moments and experiences and people that I meet.\n\n00:01:22.958 --> 00:01:25.958\nAnd, you know, after keeping these books for a number of years,\n\n00:01:25.958 --> 00:01:27.958\nI started to become very interested in collecting\n\n00:01:27.958 --> 00:01:29.958\nnot only my own personal artifacts,\n\n00:01:29.958 --> 00:01:31.958\nbut also the artifacts of other people.\n\n00:01:31.958 --> 00:01:33.958\nSo, I started collecting found objects.\n\n00:01:33.958 --> 00:01:35.958\nThis is a photograph I found lying in a gutter in New York City\n\n00:01:35.958 --> 00:01:37.958\nabout 10 years ago.\n\n00:01:37.958 --> 00:01:40.958\nOn the front, you can see the tattered black-and-white photo of a woman's face,\n\n00:01:40.958 --> 00:01:44.958\nand on the back it says, \"To Judy, the girl with the Bill Bailey voice.\n\n00:01:44.958 --> 00:01:46.958\nHave fun in whatever you do.\"\n\n00:01:46.958 --> 00:01:49.958\nAnd I really loved this idea of the partial glimpse into somebody's life.\n\n00:01:49.958 --> 00:01:52.958\nAs opposed to knowing the whole story, just knowing a little bit of the story,\n\n00:01:52.958 --> 00:01:54.958\nand then letting your own mind fill in the rest.\n\n00:01:54.958 --> 00:01:56.958\nAnd that idea of a partial glimpse is something\n\n00:01:56.958 --> 00:01:59.958\nthat will come back in a lot of the work I'll be showing later today.\n\n00:01:59.958 --> 00:02:02.958\nSo, around this time I was studying computer science at Princeton University,\n\n00:02:02.958 --> 00:02:05.958\nand I noticed that it was suddenly possible\n\n00:02:05.958 --> 00:02:07.958\nto collect these sorts of personal artifacts,\n\n00:02:07.958 --> 00:02:10.958\nnot just from street corners, but also from the Internet.\n\n00:02:10.958 --> 00:02:14.958\nAnd that suddenly, people, en masse, were leaving scores and scores\n\n00:02:14.958 --> 00:02:18.958\nof digital footprints online that told stories of their private lives.\n\n00:02:18.958 --> 00:02:22.958\nBlog posts, photographs, thoughts, feelings, opinions,\n\n00:02:22.958 --> 00:02:24.958\nall of these things were being expressed by people online,\n\n00:02:24.958 --> 00:02:26.958\nand leaving behind trails.\n\n00:02:26.958 --> 00:02:28.958\nSo, I started to write computer programs\n\n00:02:28.958 --> 00:02:31.958\nthat study very, very large sets of these online footprints.\n\n00:02:31.958 --> 00:02:33.958\nOne such project is about a year and a half old.\n\n00:02:33.958 --> 00:02:35.958\nIt's called \"We Feel Fine.\"\n\n00:02:35.958 --> 00:02:38.958\nThis is a project that scans the world's newly posted blog entries\n\n00:02:38.958 --> 00:02:41.958\nevery two or three minutes, searching for occurrences of the phrases\n\n00:02:41.958 --> 00:02:45.958\n\"I feel\" and \"I am feeling.\" And when it finds one of those phrases,\n\n00:02:45.958 --> 00:02:47.958\nit grabs the full sentence up to the period\n\n00:02:47.958 --> 00:02:50.958\nand also tries to identify demographic information about the author.\n\n00:02:50.958 --> 00:02:53.958\nSo, their gender, their age, their geographic location\n\n00:02:53.958 --> 00:02:56.958\nand what the weather conditions were like when they wrote that sentence.\n\n00:02:56.958 --> 00:02:58.958\nIt collects about 20,000 such sentences a day\n\n00:02:58.958 --> 00:03:00.958\nand it's been running for about a year and a half,\n\n00:03:00.958 --> 00:03:03.958\nhaving collected over 10 and a half million feelings now.\n\n00:03:03.958 --> 00:03:05.958\nThis is, then, how they're presented.\n\n00:03:05.958 --> 00:03:08.958\nThese dots here represent some of the English-speaking world's\n\n00:03:08.958 --> 00:03:11.958\nfeelings from the last few hours,\n\n00:03:11.958 --> 00:03:14.958\neach dot being a single sentence stated by a single blogger.\n\n00:03:14.958 --> 00:03:17.958\nAnd the color of each dot corresponds to the type of feeling inside,\n\n00:03:17.958 --> 00:03:20.958\nso the bright ones are happy, and the dark ones are sad.\n\n00:03:20.958 --> 00:03:22.958\nAnd the diameter of each dot corresponds\n\n00:03:22.958 --> 00:03:24.958\nto the length of the sentence inside.\n\n00:03:24.958 --> 00:03:27.958\nSo the small ones are short, and the bigger ones are longer.\n\n00:03:27.958 --> 00:03:29.958\n\"I feel fine with the body I'm in, there'll be no easy excuse\n\n00:03:29.958 --> 00:03:33.958\nfor why I still feel uncomfortable being close to my boyfriend,\"\n\n00:03:33.958 --> 00:03:35.958\nfrom a twenty-two-year-old in Japan.\n\n00:03:35.958 --> 00:03:37.958\n\"I got this on some trading locally,\n\n00:03:37.958 --> 00:03:39.958\nbut really don't feel like screwing with wiring and crap.\"\n\n00:03:39.958 --> 00:03:42.958\nAlso, some of the feelings contain photographs in the blog posts.\n\n00:03:42.958 --> 00:03:47.958\nAnd when that happens, these montage compositions are automatically created,\n\n00:03:47.958 --> 00:03:50.958\nwhich consist of the sentence and images being combined.\n\n00:03:50.958 --> 00:03:54.958\nAnd any of these can be opened up to reveal the sentence inside.\n\n00:03:54.958 --> 00:03:59.958\n\"I feel good.\"\n\n00:03:59.958 --> 00:04:02.958\n\"I feel rough now, and I probably gained 100,000 pounds,\n\n00:04:02.958 --> 00:04:06.958\nbut it was worth it.\"\n\n00:04:06.958 --> 00:04:09.958\n\"I love how they were able to preserve most in everything\n\n00:04:09.958 --> 00:04:11.958\nthat makes you feel close to nature -- butterflies,\n\n00:04:11.958 --> 00:04:16.958\nman-made forests, limestone caves and hey, even a huge python.\"\n\n00:04:16.958 --> 00:04:18.958\nSo the next movement is called mobs.\n\n00:04:18.958 --> 00:04:20.958\nThis provides a slightly more statistical look at things.\n\n00:04:20.958 --> 00:04:23.958\nThis is showing the world's most common feelings overall right now,\n\n00:04:23.958 --> 00:04:26.958\ndominated by better, then bad, then good, then guilty, and so on.\n\n00:04:26.958 --> 00:04:29.958\nWeather causes the feelings to assume the physical traits\n\n00:04:29.958 --> 00:04:31.958\nof the weather they represent. So the sunny ones swirl around,\n\n00:04:31.958 --> 00:04:34.958\nthe cloudy ones float along, the rainy ones fall down,\n\n00:04:34.958 --> 00:04:36.958\nand the snowy ones flutter to the ground.\n\n00:04:36.958 --> 00:04:42.958\nYou can also stop a raindrop and open the feeling inside.\n\n00:04:42.958 --> 00:04:44.958\nFinally, location causes the feelings to move to their spots\n\n00:04:44.958 --> 00:04:47.958\non a world map, giving you a sense of their geographic distribution.\n\n00:04:47.958 --> 00:04:50.958\nSo I'll show you now some of my favorite montages from \"We Feel Fine.\"\n\n00:04:50.958 --> 00:04:52.958\nThese are the images that are automatically constructed.\n\n00:04:52.958 --> 00:04:55.958\n\"I feel like I'm diagonally parked in a parallel universe.\"\n\n00:04:55.958 --> 00:04:58.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:04:58.958 --> 00:05:00.958\n\"I've kissed numerous other boys and it hasn't felt good,\n\n00:05:00.958 --> 00:05:02.958\nthe kisses felt messy and wrong,\n\n00:05:02.958 --> 00:05:08.958\nbut kissing Lucas feels beautiful and almost spiritual.\"\n\n00:05:08.958 --> 00:05:11.958\n\"I can feel my cancer grow.\"\n\n00:05:11.958 --> 00:05:14.958\n\"I feel pretty.\"\n\n00:05:14.958 --> 00:05:17.958\n\"I feel skinny, but I'm not.\"\n\n00:05:17.958 --> 00:05:19.958\n\"I'm 23, and a recovering meth and heroin addict,\n\n00:05:19.958 --> 00:05:22.958\nand feel absolutely blessed to still be alive.\"\n\n00:05:22.958 --> 00:05:25.958\n\"I can't wait to see them racing for the first time at Daytona next month,\n\n00:05:25.958 --> 00:05:27.958\nbecause I feel the need for speed.\"\n\n00:05:27.958 --> 00:05:30.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:05:30.958 --> 00:05:31.958\n\"I feel sassy.\"\n\n00:05:31.958 --> 00:05:34.958\n\"I feel so sexy in this new wig.\"\n\n00:05:34.958 --> 00:05:36.958\nAs you can see, \"We Feel Fine\" collects\n\n00:05:36.958 --> 00:05:38.958\nvery, very small-scale personal stories.\n\n00:05:38.958 --> 00:05:40.958\nSometimes, stories as short as two or three words.\n\n00:05:40.958 --> 00:05:42.958\nSo, really even challenging the notion\n\n00:05:42.958 --> 00:05:44.958\nof what can be considered a story.\n\n00:05:44.958 --> 00:05:48.958\nAnd recently, I've become interested in diving much more deeply into a single story.\n\n00:05:48.958 --> 00:05:51.958\nAnd that's led me to doing some work with the physical world,\n\n00:05:51.958 --> 00:05:52.958\nnot with the Internet,\n\n00:05:52.958 --> 00:05:56.958\nand only using the Internet at the very last moment, as a presentation medium.\n\n00:05:56.958 --> 00:05:57.958\nSo these are some newer projects that\n\n00:05:57.958 --> 00:05:59.958\nactually aren't even launched publicly yet.\n\n00:05:59.958 --> 00:06:01.958\nThe first such one is called \"The Whale Hunt.\"\n\n00:06:01.958 --> 00:06:04.958\nLast May, I spent nine days living up in Barrow, Alaska,\n\n00:06:04.958 --> 00:06:06.958\nthe northernmost settlement in the United States,\n\n00:06:06.958 --> 00:06:08.958\nwith a family of Inupiat Eskimos,\n\n00:06:08.958 --> 00:06:11.958\ndocumenting their annual spring whale hunt.\n\n00:06:11.958 --> 00:06:14.958\nThis is the whaling camp here, we're about six miles from shore,\n\n00:06:14.958 --> 00:06:17.958\ncamping on five and a half feet of thick, frozen pack ice.\n\n00:06:17.958 --> 00:06:19.958\nAnd that water that you see there is the open lead,\n\n00:06:19.958 --> 00:06:23.958\nand through that lead, bowhead whales migrate north each springtime.\n\n00:06:23.958 --> 00:06:26.958\nAnd the Eskimo community basically camps out on the edge of the ice here,\n\n00:06:26.958 --> 00:06:29.958\nwaits for a whale to come close enough to attack. And when it does,\n\n00:06:29.958 --> 00:06:31.958\nit throws a harpoon at it, and then hauls the whale up\n\n00:06:31.958 --> 00:06:33.958\nunder the ice, and cuts it up.\n\n00:06:33.958 --> 00:06:35.958\nAnd that would provide the community's food supply for a long time.\n\n00:06:35.958 --> 00:06:37.958\nSo I went up there, and I lived with these guys\n\n00:06:37.958 --> 00:06:40.958\nout in their whaling camp here, and photographed the entire experience,\n\n00:06:40.958 --> 00:06:44.958\nbeginning with the taxi ride to Newark airport in New York,\n\n00:06:44.958 --> 00:06:47.958\nand ending with the butchering of the second whale, seven and a half days later.\n\n00:06:47.958 --> 00:06:50.958\nI photographed that entire experience at five-minute intervals.\n\n00:06:50.958 --> 00:06:52.958\nSo every five minutes, I took a photograph.\n\n00:06:52.958 --> 00:06:54.958\nWhen I was awake, with the camera around my neck.\n\n00:06:54.958 --> 00:06:56.958\nWhen I was sleeping, with a tripod and a timer.\n\n00:06:56.958 --> 00:06:58.958\nAnd then in moments of high adrenaline,\n\n00:06:58.958 --> 00:07:00.958\nlike when something exciting was happening,\n\n00:07:00.958 --> 00:07:02.958\nI would up that photographic frequency to as many as\n\n00:07:02.958 --> 00:07:04.958\n37 photographs in five minutes.\n\n00:07:04.958 --> 00:07:06.958\nSo what this created was a photographic heartbeat\n\n00:07:06.958 --> 00:07:08.958\nthat sped up and slowed down, more or less matching\n\n00:07:08.958 --> 00:07:11.958\nthe changing pace of my own heartbeat.\n\n00:07:11.958 --> 00:07:13.958\nThat was the first concept here.\n\n00:07:13.958 --> 00:07:15.958\nThe second concept was to use this experience to think about\n\n00:07:15.958 --> 00:07:17.958\nthe fundamental components of any story.\n\n00:07:17.958 --> 00:07:19.958\nWhat are the things that make up a story?\n\n00:07:19.958 --> 00:07:22.958\nSo, stories have characters. Stories have concepts.\n\n00:07:22.958 --> 00:07:24.958\nStories take place in a certain area. They have contexts.\n\n00:07:24.958 --> 00:07:26.958\nThey have colors. What do they look like?\n\n00:07:26.958 --> 00:07:29.958\nThey have time. When did it take place? Dates -- when did it occur?\n\n00:07:29.958 --> 00:07:32.958\nAnd in the case of the whale hunt, also this idea of an excitement level.\n\n00:07:32.958 --> 00:07:35.958\nThe thing about stories, though, in most of the existing mediums\n\n00:07:35.958 --> 00:07:38.958\nthat we're accustomed to -- things like novels, radio,\n\n00:07:38.958 --> 00:07:40.958\nphotographs, movies, even lectures like this one --\n\n00:07:40.958 --> 00:07:44.958\nwe're very accustomed to this idea of the narrator or the camera position,\n\n00:07:44.958 --> 00:07:46.958\nsome kind of omniscient, external body\n\n00:07:46.958 --> 00:07:49.958\nthrough whose eyes you see the story.\n\n00:07:49.958 --> 00:07:51.958\nWe're very used to this.\n\n00:07:51.958 --> 00:07:53.958\nBut if you think about real life, it's not like that at all.\n\n00:07:53.958 --> 00:07:55.958\nI mean, in real life, things are much more nuanced and complex,\n\n00:07:55.958 --> 00:07:57.958\nand there's all of these overlapping stories\n\n00:07:57.958 --> 00:07:59.958\nintersecting and touching each other.\n\n00:07:59.958 --> 00:08:02.958\nAnd so I thought it would be interesting to build a framework\n\n00:08:02.958 --> 00:08:06.958\nto surface those types of stories. So, in the case of \"The Whale Hunt,\"\n\n00:08:06.958 --> 00:08:09.958\nhow could we extract something like the story of Simeon and Crawford,\n\n00:08:09.958 --> 00:08:13.958\ninvolving the concepts of wildlife, tools and blood, taking place on the Arctic Ocean,\n\n00:08:13.958 --> 00:08:16.958\ndominated by the color red, happening around 10 a.m. on May 3,\n\n00:08:16.958 --> 00:08:18.958\nwith an excitement level of high?\n\n00:08:18.958 --> 00:08:23.958\nSo, how to extract this order of narrative from this larger story?\n\n00:08:23.958 --> 00:08:28.958\nI built a web interface for viewing \"The Whale Hunt\" that attempts to do just this.\n\n00:08:28.958 --> 00:08:32.958\nSo these are all 3,214 pictures taken up there.\n\n00:08:32.958 --> 00:08:36.958\nThis is my studio in Brooklyn. This is the Arctic Ocean,\n\n00:08:36.958 --> 00:08:39.958\nand the butchering of the second whale, seven days later.\n\n00:08:39.958 --> 00:08:42.958\nYou can start to see some of the story here, told by color.\n\n00:08:42.958 --> 00:08:45.958\nSo this red strip signifies the color of the wallpaper\n\n00:08:45.958 --> 00:08:47.958\nin the basement apartment where I was staying.\n\n00:08:47.958 --> 00:08:50.958\nAnd things go white as we move out onto the Arctic Ocean.\n\n00:08:50.958 --> 00:08:54.958\nIntroduction of red down here, when whales are being cut up.\n\n00:08:54.958 --> 00:08:57.958\nYou can see a timeline, showing you the exciting moments throughout the story.\n\n00:08:57.958 --> 00:08:59.958\nThese are organized chronologically.\n\n00:08:59.958 --> 00:09:02.958\nWheel provides a slightly more playful version of the same,\n\n00:09:02.958 --> 00:09:05.958\nso these are also all the photographs organized chronologically.\n\n00:09:05.958 --> 00:09:07.958\nAnd any of these can be clicked,\n\n00:09:07.958 --> 00:09:09.958\nand then the narrative is entered at that position.\n\n00:09:09.958 --> 00:09:12.958\nSo here I am sleeping on the airplane heading up to Alaska.\n\n00:09:12.958 --> 00:09:14.958\nThat's \"Moby Dick.\"\n\n00:09:14.958 --> 00:09:16.958\nThis is the food we ate.\n\n00:09:16.958 --> 00:09:19.958\nThis is in the Patkotak's family living room\n\n00:09:19.958 --> 00:09:22.958\nin their house in Barrow. The boxed wine they served us.\n\n00:09:22.958 --> 00:09:25.958\nCigarette break outside -- I don't smoke.\n\n00:09:25.958 --> 00:09:29.958\nThis is a really exciting sequence of me sleeping.\n\n00:09:29.958 --> 00:09:33.958\nThis is out at whale camp, on the Arctic Ocean.\n\n00:09:33.958 --> 00:09:35.958\nThis graph that I'm clicking down here is meant to be\n\n00:09:35.958 --> 00:09:37.958\nreminiscent of a medical heartbeat graph,\n\n00:09:37.958 --> 00:09:42.958\nshowing the exciting moments of adrenaline.\n\n00:09:42.958 --> 00:09:45.958\nThis is the ice starting to freeze over. The snow fence they built.\n\n00:09:45.958 --> 00:09:48.958\nAnd so what I'll show you now is the ability to pull out sub-stories.\n\n00:09:48.958 --> 00:09:52.958\nSo, here you see the cast. These are all of the people in \"The Whale Hunt\"\n\n00:09:52.958 --> 00:09:54.958\nand the two whales that were killed down here.\n\n00:09:54.958 --> 00:09:56.958\nAnd we could do something as arbitrary as, say,\n\n00:09:56.958 --> 00:10:02.958\nextract the story of Rony, involving the concepts of blood\n\n00:10:02.958 --> 00:10:07.958\nand whales and tools, taking place on the Arctic Ocean,\n\n00:10:07.958 --> 00:10:11.958\nat Ahkivgaq camp, with the heartbeat level of fast.\n\n00:10:11.958 --> 00:10:13.958\nAnd now we've whittled down that whole story\n\n00:10:13.958 --> 00:10:15.958\nto just 29 matching photographs,\n\n00:10:15.958 --> 00:10:17.958\nand then we can enter the narrative at that position.\n\n00:10:17.958 --> 00:10:19.958\nAnd you can see Rony cutting up the whale here.\n\n00:10:19.958 --> 00:10:21.958\nThese whales are about 40 feet long,\n\n00:10:21.958 --> 00:10:24.958\nand weighing over 40 tons. And they provide the food source\n\n00:10:24.958 --> 00:10:28.958\nfor the community for much of the year.\n\n00:10:28.958 --> 00:10:33.958\nSkipping ahead a bit more here, this is Rony on the whale carcass.\n\n00:10:33.958 --> 00:10:36.958\nThey use no chainsaws or anything; it's entirely just blades,\n\n00:10:36.958 --> 00:10:38.958\nand an incredibly efficient process.\n\n00:10:38.958 --> 00:10:41.958\nThis is the guys on the rope, pulling open the carcass.\n\n00:10:41.958 --> 00:10:45.958\nThis is the muktuk, or the blubber, all lined up for community distribution.\n\n00:10:45.958 --> 00:10:48.958\nIt's baleen. Moving on.\n\n00:10:48.958 --> 00:10:50.958\nSo what I'm going to tell you about next\n\n00:10:50.958 --> 00:10:53.958\nis a very new thing. It's not even a project yet.\n\n00:10:53.958 --> 00:10:56.958\nSo, just yesterday, I flew in here from Singapore, and before that,\n\n00:10:56.958 --> 00:11:00.958\nI was spending two weeks in Bhutan, the small Himalayan kingdom\n\n00:11:00.958 --> 00:11:02.958\nnestled between Tibet and India.\n\n00:11:02.958 --> 00:11:05.958\nAnd I was doing a project there about happiness,\n\n00:11:05.958 --> 00:11:07.958\ninterviewing a lot of local people.\n\n00:11:07.958 --> 00:11:13.958\nSo Bhutan has this really wacky thing where they base\n\n00:11:13.958 --> 00:11:15.958\nmost of their high-level governmental decisions around the concept\n\n00:11:15.958 --> 00:11:19.958\nof gross national happiness instead of gross domestic product,\n\n00:11:19.958 --> 00:11:21.958\nand they've been doing this since the '70s.\n\n00:11:21.958 --> 00:11:24.958\nAnd it leads to just a completely different value system.\n\n00:11:24.958 --> 00:11:26.958\nIt's an incredibly non-materialistic culture,\n\n00:11:26.958 --> 00:11:29.958\nwhere people don't have a lot, but they're incredibly happy.\n\n00:11:29.958 --> 00:11:32.958\nSo I went around and I talked to people about some of these ideas.\n\n00:11:32.958 --> 00:11:35.958\nSo, I did a number of things. I asked people a number of set questions,\n\n00:11:35.958 --> 00:11:37.958\nand took a number of set photographs,\n\n00:11:37.958 --> 00:11:39.958\nand interviewed them with audio, and also took pictures.\n\n00:11:39.958 --> 00:11:41.958\nI would start by asking people to rate their happiness\n\n00:11:41.958 --> 00:11:44.958\nbetween one and 10, which is kind of inherently absurd.\n\n00:11:44.958 --> 00:11:47.958\nAnd then when they answered, I would inflate that number of balloons\n\n00:11:47.958 --> 00:11:49.958\nand give them that number of balloons to hold.\n\n00:11:49.958 --> 00:11:51.958\nSo, you have some really happy person holding 10 balloons,\n\n00:11:51.958 --> 00:11:55.958\nand some really sad soul holding one balloon.\n\n00:11:55.958 --> 00:11:58.958\nBut you know, even holding one balloon is like, kind of happy.\n\n00:11:58.958 --> 00:12:00.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:12:00.958 --> 00:12:02.958\nAnd then I would ask them a number of questions like\n\n00:12:02.958 --> 00:12:04.958\nwhat was the happiest day in their life, what makes them happy.\n\n00:12:04.958 --> 00:12:07.958\nAnd then finally, I would ask them to make a wish.\n\n00:12:07.958 --> 00:12:09.958\nAnd when they made a wish, I would write their wish\n\n00:12:09.958 --> 00:12:12.958\nonto one of the balloons and take a picture of them holding it.\n\n00:12:12.958 --> 00:12:15.958\nSo I'm going to show you now just a few brief snippets\n\n00:12:15.958 --> 00:12:18.958\nof some of the interviews that I did, some of the people I spoke with.\n\n00:12:18.958 --> 00:12:20.958\nThis is an 11-year-old student.\n\n00:12:20.958 --> 00:12:23.958\nHe was playing cops and robbers with his friends, running around town,\n\n00:12:23.958 --> 00:12:25.958\nand they all had plastic toy guns.\n\n00:12:25.958 --> 00:12:28.958\nHis wish was to become a police officer.\n\n00:12:28.958 --> 00:12:31.958\nHe was getting started early. Those were his hands.\n\n00:12:31.958 --> 00:12:33.958\nI took pictures of everybody's hands,\n\n00:12:33.958 --> 00:12:35.958\nbecause I think you can often tell a lot about somebody\n\n00:12:35.958 --> 00:12:38.958\nfrom how their hands look.

She was selling oranges on the side of the road.\n\n00:16:59.958 --> 00:17:01.958\nI asked her about her wish, and she said,\n\n00:17:01.958 --> 00:17:04.958\n\"You know, maybe I'll live, maybe I'll die, but I don't have a wish.\"\n\n00:17:09.958 --> 00:17:12.958\nShe was chewing betel nut, which caused her teeth\n\n00:17:12.958 --> 00:17:14.958\nover the years to turn very red.\n\n00:17:14.958 --> 00:17:20.958\nFinally, this is a 26-year-old nun I spoke to.\n\n00:17:20.958 --> 00:17:23.958\nHer wish was to make a pilgrimage to Tibet.\n\n00:17:23.958 --> 00:17:25.958\nI asked her how long she planned to live in the nunnery and she said,\n\n00:17:25.958 --> 00:17:27.958\n\"Well, you know, of course, it's impermanent,\n\n00:17:27.958 --> 00:17:31.958\nbut my plan is to live here until I'm 30, and then enter a hermitage.\"\n\n00:17:31.958 --> 00:17:36.958\nAnd I said, \"You mean, like a cave?\" And she said, \"Yeah, like a cave.\"\n\n00:17:36.958 --> 00:17:39.958\nAnd I said, \"Wow, and how long will you live in the cave?\"\n\n00:17:39.958 --> 00:17:41.958\nAnd she said, \"Well, you know,\n\n00:17:41.958 --> 00:17:45.958\nI think I'd kind of like to live my whole life in the cave.\"\n\n00:17:45.958 --> 00:17:47.958\nI just thought that was amazing. I mean, she spoke in a way --\n\n00:17:47.958 --> 00:17:50.958\nwith amazing English, and amazing humor, and amazing laughter --\n\n00:17:50.958 --> 00:17:52.958\nthat made her seem like somebody I could have bumped into\n\n00:17:52.958 --> 00:17:55.958\non the streets of New York, or in Vermont, where I'm from.\n\n00:17:55.958 --> 00:17:58.958\nBut here she had been living in a nunnery for the last seven years.\n\n00:17:58.958 --> 00:18:01.958\nI asked her a little bit more about the cave\n\n00:18:01.958 --> 00:18:05.958\nand what she planned would happen once she went there, you know.\n\n00:18:05.958 --> 00:18:07.958\nWhat if she saw the truth after just one year,\n\n00:18:07.958 --> 00:18:09.958\nwhat would she do for the next 35 years in her life?\n\n00:18:09.958 --> 00:18:11.958\nAnd this is what she said.\n\n00:18:11.958 --> 00:18:16.958\nWoman: I think I'm going to stay for 35. Maybe -- maybe I'll die.\n\n00:18:16.958 --> 00:18:18.958\nJonathan Harris: Maybe you'll die? Woman: Yes.\n\n00:18:18.958 --> 00:18:21.958\nJH: 10 years? Woman: Yes, yes. JH: 10 years, that's a long time.\n\n00:18:21.958 --> 00:18:24.958\nWoman: Yes, not maybe one, 10 years, maybe I can die\n\n00:18:24.958 --> 00:18:26.958\nwithin one year, or something like that.\n\n00:18:26.958 --> 00:18:28.958\nJH: Are you hoping to?\n\n00:18:28.958 --> 00:18:30.958\nWoman: Ah, because you know, it's impermanent.\n\n00:18:30.958 --> 00:18:36.958\nJH: Yeah, but -- yeah, OK. Do you hope --\n\n00:18:36.958 --> 00:18:39.958\nwould you prefer to live in the cave for 40 years,\n\n00:18:39.958 --> 00:18:41.958\nor to live for one year?\n\n00:18:41.958 --> 00:18:45.958\nWoman: But I prefer for maybe 40 to 50.\n\n00:18:45.958 --> 00:18:46.958\nJH: 40 to 50? Yeah.\n\n00:18:46.958 --> 00:18:49.958\nWoman: Yes. From then, I'm going to the heaven.\n\n00:18:49.958 --> 00:18:54.958\nJH: Well, I wish you the best of luck with it.\n\n00:18:54.958 --> 00:18:55.958\nWoman: Thank you.\n\n00:18:55.958 --> 00:18:58.958\nJH: I hope it's everything that you hope it will be.\n\n00:18:58.958 --> 00:19:00.958\nSo thank you again, so much.\n\n00:19:00.958 --> 00:19:02.958\nWoman: You're most welcome.\n\n00:19:02.958 --> 00:19:04.958\nJH: So if you caught that, she said she hoped to die\n\n00:19:04.958 --> 00:19:07.958\nwhen she was around 40. That was enough life for her.\n\n00:19:07.958 --> 00:19:09.958\nSo, the last thing we did, very quickly,\n\n00:19:09.958 --> 00:19:12.958\nis I took all those wish balloons -- there were 117 interviews,\n\n00:19:12.958 --> 00:19:16.958\n117 wishes -- and I brought them up to a place called Dochula,\n\n00:19:16.958 --> 00:19:20.958\nwhich is a mountain pass in Bhutan, at 10,300 feet,\n\n00:19:20.958 --> 00:19:23.958\none of the more sacred places in Bhutan.\n\n00:19:23.958 --> 00:19:25.958\nAnd up there, there are thousands of prayer flags\n\n00:19:25.958 --> 00:19:27.958\nthat people have spread out over the years.\n\n00:19:27.958 --> 00:19:30.958\nAnd we re-inflated all of the balloons, put them up on a string,\n\n00:19:30.958 --> 00:19:32.958\nand hung them up there among the prayer flags.\n\n00:19:32.958 --> 00:19:34.958\nAnd they're actually still flying up there today.\n\n00:19:34.958 --> 00:19:37.958\nSo if any of you have any Bhutan travel plans in the near future,\n\n00:19:37.958 --> 00:19:40.958\nyou can go check these out. Here are some images from that.\n\n00:19:41.958 --> 00:19:45.958\nWe said a Buddhist prayer so that all these wishes could come true.\n\n00:19:54.958 --> 00:19:57.958\nYou can start to see some familiar balloons here.\n\n00:19:57.958 --> 00:20:02.958\n\"To make some money and to open a store\" was the Indian road worker.\n\n00:20:10.958 --> 00:20:12.958\nThanks very much.\n\n00:20:12.958 --> 00:20:15.958\n(Applause)"}, {"title": "A tour of modern architecture", "duration": "921", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/reed_kroloff_on_modern_and_romantic_architecture", "transcript": "To be new at TED \u2014 it's like being the last high-school virgin. (Laughter) You know that all of the cool people are \u2014 they're doing it. And you're on the outside, you're at home. You're like the Raspyni Brothers, where you've got your balls in cold water. And \u2014 (Laughter) \u2014 you just play with your fingers all day. And then you get invited. And you're on the inside, and it's everything you hoped it would be. It's exciting and there's music playing all of the time and then suddenly it's over. And it's only taken five minutes. And you want to go back and do it again. But I really appreciate being here. And thank you, Chris, and also, thank you, Deborah Patton, for making this possible.So anyway, today we'll talk about architecture a little bit, within the subject of creation and optimism. And if you put creation and optimism together, you've got two choices that you can talk about. You can talk about creationism \u2014 which I think wouldn't go down well with this audience, at least not from a view where you were a proponent of it \u2014 or you can talk about optimisations, spelled the British way, with an S, instead of a Z. And I think that's what I'd like to talk about today. But any kind of conversation about architecture \u2014 which is, in fact, what you were just talking about, what was going on here, setting up TED, small-scale architecture \u2014 at the present time can't really happen without a conversation about this, the World Trade Center, and what's been going on there, what it means to us.Because if architecture is what I believe it to be, which is the built form of our cultural ambitions, what do you do when presented with an opportunity to rectify a situation that represents somebody else's cultural ambitions relative to us? And our own opportunity to make something new there? This has been a really galvanizing issue for a long time. I think that the World Trade Center in, rather an unfortunate way, brought architecture into focus in a way that I don't think people had thought of in a long time, and made it a subject for common conversation. I don't remember, in my 20-year career of practicing and writing about architecture, a time when five people sat me down at a table and asked me very serious questions about zoning, fire exiting, safety concerns and whether carpet burns. These are just not things we talked about very often. And yet, now, it's talked about all the time. At the point where you can weaponize your buildings, you have to suddenly think about architecture in a very different way. And so now we're going to think about architecture in a very different way, we're going to think about it like this.How many of you saw USA Today, today? There it is. Looks like that. There's the World Trade Center site, on the front cover. They've made a selection. They've chosen a project by Daniel Libeskind, the enfant terrible of the moment of architecture. Child-prodigy piano player, he started on the squeezebox, and moved to a little more serious issue, a bigger instrument, and now to an even larger instrument, upon which to work his particular brand of deconstructivist magic, as you see here. He was one of six people who were invited to participate in this competition, after six previous firms struck out with things that were so stupid and banal that even the city of New York was forced to go, \"Oh, I'm really sorry, we screwed up.\" Right. Can we do this again from the top, except use some people with a vague hint of talent, instead of just six utter boobs like we brought in last time, real estate hacks of the kind who usually plan our cities. Let's bring in some real architects for a change. And so we got this, or we had a choice of that. Oh, stop clapping.(Laughter)It's too late. That is gone. This was a scheme by a team called THINK, a New York-based team, and then there was that one, which was the Libeskind scheme. This one, this is going to be the new World Trade Center: a giant hole in the ground with big buildings falling into it. Now, I don't know what you think, but I think this is a pretty stupid decision, because what you've done is just made a permanent memorial to destruction by making it look like the destruction is going to continue forever. But that's what we're going to do. But I want you to think about these things in terms of a kind of ongoing struggle that American architecture represents, and that these two things talk about very specifically. And that is the wild divergence in how we choose our architects, in trying to decide whether we want architecture from the kind of technocratic solution to everything \u2014 that there is a large, technical answer that can solve all problems, be they social, be they physical, be they chemical \u2014 or something that's more of a romantic solution.Now, I don't mean romantic as in, this is a nice place to take someone on a date. I mean romantic in the sense of, there are things larger and grander than us. So, in the American tradition, the difference between the technocratic and the romantic, would be the difference between Thomas Jefferson's Cartesian grids spreading across the United States, that gives us basically the whole shape of every western state in the United States, as a really, truly, technocratic solution, a bowing to the \u2014 in Jefferson's time \u2014 current, popular philosophy of rationalism. Or the way we went to describe that later: manifest destiny. Now, which would you rather be? A grid, or manifest destiny? Manifest destiny.(Laughter)It's a big deal. It sounds big, it sounds important, it sounds solid. It sounds American. Ballsy, serious, male. And that kind of fight has gone on back and forth in architecture all the time. I mean, it goes on in our private lives, too, every single day. We all want to go out and buy an Audi TT, don't we? Everyone here must own one, or at least they craved one the moment they saw one. And then they hopped in it, turned the little electronic key, rather than the real key, zipped home on their new superhighway, and drove straight into a garage that looks like a Tudor castle.(Laughter)Why? Why? Why do you want to do that? Why do we all want to do that? I even owned a Tudor thing once myself.(Laughter)It's in our nature to go ricocheting back and forth between this technocratic solution and a larger, sort of more romantic image of where we are. So we're going to go straight into this. Can I have the lights off for a moment? I'm going to talk about two architects very, very briefly that represent the current split, architecturally, between these two traditions of a technocratic or technological solution and a romantic solution. And these are two of the top architectural practices in the United States today. One very young, one a little more mature. This is the work of a firm called SHoP, and what you're seeing here, is their isometric drawings of what will be a large-scale camera obscura in a public park. Does everybody know what a camera obscura is? Yeah, it's one of those giant camera lenses that takes a picture of the outside world \u2014 it's sort of a little movie, without any moving parts \u2014 and projects it on a page, and you can see the world outside you as you walk around it.This is just the outline of it, and you can see, does it look like a regular building? No. It's actually non-orthogonal: it's not up and down, square, rectangular, anything like that, that you'd see in a normal shape of a building. The computer revolution, the technocratic, technological revolution, has allowed us to jettison normal-shaped buildings, traditionally shaped buildings, in favor of non-orthogonal buildings such as this. What's interesting about it is not the shape. What's interesting about it is how it's made. How it's made. A brand-new way to put buildings together, something called mass customization. No, it is not an oxymoron. What makes the building expensive, in the traditional sense, is making individual parts custom, that you can't do over and over again. That's why we all live in developer houses. They all want to save money by building the same thing 500 times. That's because it's cheaper.Mass customization works by an architect feeding into a computer, a program that says, manufacture these parts. The computer then talks to a machine \u2014 a computer-operated machine, a cad-cam machine \u2014 that can make a zillion different changes, at a moment's notice, because the computer is just a machine. It doesn't care. It's manufacturing the parts. It doesn't see any excess cost. It doesn't spend any extra time. It's not a laborer \u2014 it's simply an electronic lathe, so the parts can all be cut at the same time. Meanwhile, instead of sending someone working drawings, which are those huge sets of blueprints that you've seen your whole life, what the architect can do is send a set of assembly instructions, like you used to get when you were a child, when you bought little models that said, \"Bolt A to B, and C to D.\" And so what the builder will get is every single individual part that has been custom manufactured off-site and delivered on a truck to the site, to that builder, and a set of these instruction manuals. Just simple \"Bolt A to B\" and they will be able to put them together. Here's the little drawing that tells them how that works \u2014 and that's what will happen in the end.You're underneath it, looking up into the lens of the camera obscura. Lest you think this is all fiction, lest you think this is all fantasy, or romance, these same architects were asked to produce something for the central courtyard of PS1, which is a museum in Brooklyn, New York, as part of their young architects summer series. And they said, well, it's summer, what do you do? In the summer, you go to the beach. And when you go to the beach, what do you get? You get sand dunes. So let's make architectural sand dunes and a beach cabana. So they went out and they modeled a computer model of a sand dune. They took photographs, they fed the photographs into their computer program, and that computer program shaped a sand dune and then took that sand dune shape and turned it into \u2014 at their instructions, using standard software with slight modifications \u2014 a set of instructions for pieces of wood. And those are the pieces of wood. Those are the instructions. These are the pieces, and here's a little of that blown up.What you can see is there's about six different colors, and each color represents a type of wood to be cut, a piece of wood to be cut. All of which were delivered by flat bed, on a truck, and hand assembled in 48 hours by a team of eight people, only one of whom had ever seen the plans before. Only one of whom had ever seen the plans before. And here comes dune-scape, coming up out of the courtyard, and there it is fully built. There are only 16 different pieces of wood, only 16 different assembly parts here. Looks like a beautiful piano sounding board on the inside. It has its own built-in swimming pool, very, very cool. It's a great place for parties \u2014 it was, it was only up for six weeks. It's got little dressing rooms and cabanas, where lots of interesting things went on, all summer long.Now, lest you think that this is only for the light at heart, or just temporary installations, this is the same firm working at the World Trade Center, replacing the bridge that used to go across West Street, that very important pedestrian connection between the city of New York and the redevelopment of the West Side. They were asked to design, replace that bridge in six weeks, building it, including all of the parts, manufactured. And they were able to do it. That was their design, using that same computer modeling system and only five or six really different kinds of parts, a couple of struts, like this, some exterior cladding material and a very simple framing system that was all manufactured off-site and delivered by truck. They were able to create that. They were able to create something wonderful. They're now building a 16-story building on the side of New York, using the same technology. Here we're going to walk across the bridge at night. It's self-lit, you don't need any overhead lighting, so the neighbors don't complain about metal-halide lighting in their face. Here it is going across. And there, down the other side, and you get the same kind of grandeur.Now, let me show you, quickly, the opposite, if I may. Woo, pretty, huh. This is the other side of the coin. This is the work of David Rockwell from New York City, whose work you can see out here today. The current king of the romantics, who approaches his work in a very different fashion. It's not to create a technological solution, it's to seduce you into something that you can do, into something that will please you, something that will lift your spirits, something that will make you feel as if are in another world \u2014 such as his Nobu restaurant in New York, which is supposed to take you from the clutter of New York City to the simplicity of Japan and the elegance of Japanese tradition. \"When it's all said and done, it's got to look like seaweed,\" said the owner. Or his restaurant, Pod, in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.I want you to know the room you're looking at is stark white. Every single surface of this restaurant is white. The reason it has so much color is that it changes using lighting. It's all about sensuality. It's all about transforming. Watch this \u2014 I'm not touching any buttons, ladies and gentlemen. This is happening by itself. It transforms through the magic of lighting. It's all about sensuality. It's all about touch. Rosa Mexicano restaurant, where he transports us to the shores of Acapulco, up on the Upper West Side, with this wall of cliff divers who \u2014 there you go, like that. Let's see it one more time. Okay, just to make sure that you've enjoyed it. And finally, it's about comfort, it's about making you feel good in places that you wouldn't have felt good before. It's about bringing nature to the inside.In the Guardian Tower of New York, converted to a W Union Square \u2014 I'm sorry I'm rushing \u2014 where we had to bring in the best horticulturists in the world to make sure that the interior of this dragged the garden space of the court garden of the Union Square into the building itself. It's about stimulation. This is a wine-buying experience simplified by color and taste. Fizzy, fresh, soft, luscious, juicy, smooth, big and sweet wines, all explained to you by color and texture on the wall. And finally, it's about entertainment, as in his headquarters for the Cirque du Soleil, Orlando, Florida, where you're asked to enter the Greek theater, look under the tent and join the magic world of Cirque du Soleil. And I think I'll probably leave it at that.

And it's only taken five minutes.\n\n00:00:51.958 --> 00:00:54.958\nAnd you want to go back and do it again.\n\n00:00:54.958 --> 00:00:58.958\nBut I really appreciate being here.

There it is. Looks like that.\n\n00:03:18.958 --> 00:03:20.958\nThere's the World Trade Center site, on the front cover.\n\n00:03:20.958 --> 00:03:22.958\nThey've made a selection.\n\n00:03:22.958 --> 00:03:25.958\nThey've chosen a project by Daniel Libeskind,\n\n00:03:25.958 --> 00:03:29.958\nthe enfant terrible of the moment of architecture.\n\n00:03:29.958 --> 00:03:32.958\nChild-prodigy piano player, he started on the squeezebox,\n\n00:03:32.958 --> 00:03:35.958\nand moved to a little more serious issue, a bigger instrument,\n\n00:03:35.958 --> 00:03:37.958\nand now to an even larger instrument,\n\n00:03:37.958 --> 00:03:43.958\nupon which to work his particular brand of deconstructivist magic,\n\n00:03:43.958 --> 00:03:45.958\nas you see here.\n\n00:03:45.958 --> 00:03:48.958\nHe was one of six people who were invited to participate in this competition,\n\n00:03:48.958 --> 00:03:53.958\nafter six previous firms struck out\n\n00:03:53.958 --> 00:03:55.958\nwith things that were so stupid and banal\n\n00:03:55.958 --> 00:03:57.958\nthat even the city of New York was forced to go,\n\n00:03:57.958 --> 00:03:59.958\n\"Oh, I'm really sorry, we screwed up.\"\n\n00:03:59.958 --> 00:04:03.958\nRight. Can we do this again from the top,\n\n00:04:03.958 --> 00:04:05.958\nexcept use some people with a vague hint of talent,\n\n00:04:05.958 --> 00:04:10.958\ninstead of just six utter boobs like we brought in last time,\n\n00:04:10.958 --> 00:04:13.958\nreal estate hacks of the kind who usually plan our cities.\n\n00:04:13.958 --> 00:04:15.958\nLet's bring in some real architects for a change.\n\n00:04:15.958 --> 00:04:23.958\nAnd so we got this, or we had a choice of that. Oh, stop clapping.\n\n00:04:23.958 --> 00:04:25.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:04:25.958 --> 00:04:27.958\nIt's too late. That is gone.\n\n00:04:27.958 --> 00:04:30.958\nThis was a scheme by a team called THINK, a New York-based team,\n\n00:04:30.958 --> 00:04:33.958\nand then there was that one, which was the Libeskind scheme.\n\n00:04:33.958 --> 00:04:37.958\nThis one, this is going to be the new World Trade Center:\n\n00:04:37.958 --> 00:04:41.958\na giant hole in the ground with big buildings falling into it.\n\n00:04:41.958 --> 00:04:45.958\nNow, I don't know what you think, but I think this is a pretty stupid decision,\n\n00:04:45.958 --> 00:04:50.958\nbecause what you've done is just made a permanent memorial to destruction\n\n00:04:50.958 --> 00:04:54.958\nby making it look like the destruction is going to continue forever.\n\n00:04:54.958 --> 00:04:56.958\nBut that's what we're going to do.\n\n00:04:56.958 --> 00:04:59.958\nBut I want you to think about these things\n\n00:04:59.958 --> 00:05:03.958\nin terms of a kind of ongoing struggle that American architecture represents,\n\n00:05:03.958 --> 00:05:05.958\nand that these two things talk about very specifically.\n\n00:05:05.958 --> 00:05:10.958\nAnd that is the wild divergence in how we choose our architects,\n\n00:05:10.958 --> 00:05:13.958\nin trying to decide whether we want architecture\n\n00:05:13.958 --> 00:05:16.958\nfrom the kind of technocratic solution to everything --\n\n00:05:16.958 --> 00:05:21.958\nthat there is a large, technical answer that can solve all problems,\n\n00:05:21.958 --> 00:05:25.958\nbe they social, be they physical, be they chemical --\n\n00:05:25.958 --> 00:05:28.958\nor something that's more of a romantic solution.\n\n00:05:28.958 --> 00:05:32.958\nNow, I don't mean romantic as in, this is a nice place to take someone on a date.\n\n00:05:32.958 --> 00:05:38.958\nI mean romantic in the sense of, there are things larger and grander than us.\n\n00:05:38.958 --> 00:05:40.958\nSo, in the American tradition,\n\n00:05:40.958 --> 00:05:42.958\nthe difference between the technocratic and the romantic,\n\n00:05:42.958 --> 00:05:45.958\nwould be the difference between Thomas Jefferson's\n\n00:05:45.958 --> 00:05:48.958\nCartesian grids spreading across the United States,\n\n00:05:48.958 --> 00:05:51.958\nthat gives us basically the whole shape\n\n00:05:51.958 --> 00:05:53.958\nof every western state in the United States,\n\n00:05:53.958 --> 00:05:59.958\nas a really, truly, technocratic solution, a bowing to the --\n\n00:05:59.958 --> 00:06:05.958\nin Jefferson's time -- current, popular philosophy of rationalism.\n\n00:06:05.958 --> 00:06:12.958\nOr the way we went to describe that later: manifest destiny.\n\n00:06:12.958 --> 00:06:17.958\nNow, which would you rather be? A grid, or manifest destiny?\n\n00:06:17.958 --> 00:06:19.958\nManifest destiny.\n\n00:06:19.958 --> 00:06:20.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:06:20.958 --> 00:06:24.958\nIt's a big deal. It sounds big, it sounds important,\n\n00:06:24.958 --> 00:06:30.958\nit sounds solid. It sounds American. Ballsy, serious, male.\n\n00:06:30.958 --> 00:06:35.958\nAnd that kind of fight has gone on back and forth in architecture all the time.\n\n00:06:35.958 --> 00:06:38.958\nI mean, it goes on in our private lives, too, every single day.\n\n00:06:38.958 --> 00:06:41.958\nWe all want to go out and buy an Audi TT, don't we?\n\n00:06:41.958 --> 00:06:44.958\nEveryone here must own one, or at least they craved one\n\n00:06:44.958 --> 00:06:46.958\nthe moment they saw one.\n\n00:06:46.958 --> 00:06:48.958\nAnd then they hopped in it, turned the little electronic key,\n\n00:06:48.958 --> 00:06:52.958\nrather than the real key, zipped home on their new superhighway,\n\n00:06:52.958 --> 00:06:57.958\nand drove straight into a garage that looks like a Tudor castle.\n\n00:06:57.958 --> 00:06:59.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:06:59.958 --> 00:07:01.958\nWhy? Why? Why do you want to do that?\n\n00:07:03.958 --> 00:07:07.958\nWhy do we all want to do that? I even owned a Tudor thing once myself.\n\n00:07:07.958 --> 00:07:08.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:07:08.958 --> 00:07:12.958\nIt's in our nature to go ricocheting\n\n00:07:12.958 --> 00:07:17.958\nback and forth between this technocratic solution\n\n00:07:17.958 --> 00:07:20.958\nand a larger, sort of more romantic image of where we are.\n\n00:07:20.958 --> 00:07:22.958\nSo we're going to go straight into this.\n\n00:07:22.958 --> 00:07:24.958\nCan I have the lights off for a moment?\n\n00:07:24.958 --> 00:07:27.958\nI'm going to talk about two architects very, very briefly\n\n00:07:27.958 --> 00:07:29.958\nthat represent the current split, architecturally,\n\n00:07:29.958 --> 00:07:31.958\nbetween these two traditions of a technocratic\n\n00:07:31.958 --> 00:07:35.958\nor technological solution and a romantic solution.\n\n00:07:35.958 --> 00:07:38.958\nAnd these are two of the top architectural practices in the United States today.\n\n00:07:38.958 --> 00:07:40.958\nOne very young, one a little more mature.\n\n00:07:40.958 --> 00:07:42.958\nThis is the work of a firm called SHoP,\n\n00:07:42.958 --> 00:07:46.958\nand what you're seeing here, is their isometric drawings\n\n00:07:46.958 --> 00:07:50.958\nof what will be a large-scale camera obscura in a public park.\n\n00:07:50.958 --> 00:07:53.958\nDoes everybody know what a camera obscura is?\n\n00:07:53.958 --> 00:07:55.958\nYeah, it's one of those giant camera lenses\n\n00:07:55.958 --> 00:07:57.958\nthat takes a picture of the outside world --\n\n00:07:57.958 --> 00:08:00.958\nit's sort of a little movie, without any moving parts --\n\n00:08:00.958 --> 00:08:04.958\nand projects it on a page, and you can see the world outside you as you walk around it.\n\n00:08:04.958 --> 00:08:07.958\nThis is just the outline of it, and you can see,\n\n00:08:07.958 --> 00:08:09.958\ndoes it look like a regular building? No.\n\n00:08:09.958 --> 00:08:11.958\nIt's actually non-orthogonal: it's not up and down,\n\n00:08:11.958 --> 00:08:13.958\nsquare, rectangular, anything like that,\n\n00:08:13.958 --> 00:08:15.958\nthat you'd see in a normal shape of a building.\n\n00:08:15.958 --> 00:08:18.958\nThe computer revolution, the technocratic, technological revolution,\n\n00:08:18.958 --> 00:08:21.958\nhas allowed us to jettison normal-shaped buildings,\n\n00:08:21.958 --> 00:08:25.958\ntraditionally shaped buildings, in favor of non-orthogonal buildings such as this.\n\n00:08:25.958 --> 00:08:27.958\nWhat's interesting about it is not the shape.\n\n00:08:27.958 --> 00:08:31.958\nWhat's interesting about it is how it's made. How it's made.\n\n00:08:31.958 --> 00:08:33.958\nA brand-new way to put buildings together,\n\n00:08:33.958 --> 00:08:36.958\nsomething called mass customization. No, it is not an oxymoron.\n\n00:08:36.958 --> 00:08:39.958\nWhat makes the building expensive, in the traditional sense,\n\n00:08:39.958 --> 00:08:42.958\nis making individual parts custom, that you can't do over and over again.\n\n00:08:42.958 --> 00:08:44.958\nThat's why we all live in developer houses.\n\n00:08:44.958 --> 00:08:48.958\nThey all want to save money by building the same thing 500 times.\n\n00:08:48.958 --> 00:08:50.958\nThat's because it's cheaper.\n\n00:08:50.958 --> 00:08:54.958\nMass customization works by an architect feeding into a computer,\n\n00:08:54.958 --> 00:08:57.958\na program that says, manufacture these parts.\n\n00:08:57.958 --> 00:08:59.958\nThe computer then talks to a machine --\n\n00:08:59.958 --> 00:09:03.958\na computer-operated machine, a cad-cam machine --\n\n00:09:03.958 --> 00:09:06.958\nthat can make a zillion different changes, at a moment's notice,\n\n00:09:06.958 --> 00:09:08.958\nbecause the computer is just a machine.\n\n00:09:08.958 --> 00:09:11.958\nIt doesn't care. It's manufacturing the parts.\n\n00:09:11.958 --> 00:09:14.958\nIt doesn't see any excess cost. It doesn't spend any extra time.\n\n00:09:14.958 --> 00:09:18.958\nIt's not a laborer -- it's simply an electronic lathe,\n\n00:09:18.958 --> 00:09:20.958\nso the parts can all be cut at the same time.\n\n00:09:20.958 --> 00:09:23.958\nMeanwhile, instead of sending someone working drawings,\n\n00:09:23.958 --> 00:09:26.958\nwhich are those huge sets of blueprints that you've seen your whole life,\n\n00:09:26.958 --> 00:09:31.958\nwhat the architect can do is send a set of assembly instructions,\n\n00:09:31.958 --> 00:09:33.958\nlike you used to get when you were a child,\n\n00:09:33.958 --> 00:09:37.958\nwhen you bought little models that said, \"Bolt A to B, and C to D.\"\n\n00:09:37.958 --> 00:09:41.958\nAnd so what the builder will get is every single individual part\n\n00:09:41.958 --> 00:09:45.958\nthat has been custom manufactured off-site and delivered on a truck\n\n00:09:45.958 --> 00:09:49.958\nto the site, to that builder, and a set of these instruction manuals.\n\n00:09:49.958 --> 00:09:52.958\nJust simple \"Bolt A to B\" and they will be able to put them together.\n\n00:09:52.958 --> 00:09:55.958\nHere's the little drawing that tells them how that works --\n\n00:09:55.958 --> 00:09:57.958\nand that's what will happen in the end.\n\n00:09:57.958 --> 00:10:00.958\nYou're underneath it, looking up into the lens of the camera obscura.\n\n00:10:00.958 --> 00:10:05.958\nLest you think this is all fiction, lest you think this is all fantasy, or romance,\n\n00:10:05.958 --> 00:10:08.958\nthese same architects were asked to produce something\n\n00:10:08.958 --> 00:10:12.958\nfor the central courtyard of PS1, which is a museum in Brooklyn, New York,\n\n00:10:12.958 --> 00:10:14.958\nas part of their young architects summer series.\n\n00:10:14.958 --> 00:10:16.958\nAnd they said, well, it's summer, what do you do?\n\n00:10:16.958 --> 00:10:18.958\nIn the summer, you go to the beach.\n\n00:10:18.958 --> 00:10:20.958\nAnd when you go to the beach, what do you get? You get sand dunes.\n\n00:10:20.958 --> 00:10:23.958\nSo let's make architectural sand dunes and a beach cabana.\n\n00:10:23.958 --> 00:10:27.958\nSo they went out and they modeled a computer model of a sand dune.\n\n00:10:27.958 --> 00:10:30.958\nThey took photographs, they fed the photographs into their computer program,\n\n00:10:30.958 --> 00:10:34.958\nand that computer program shaped a sand dune\n\n00:10:34.958 --> 00:10:37.958\nand then took that sand dune shape and turned it into --\n\n00:10:37.958 --> 00:10:41.958\nat their instructions, using standard software with slight modifications --\n\n00:10:41.958 --> 00:10:44.958\na set of instructions for pieces of wood.\n\n00:10:44.958 --> 00:10:46.958\nAnd those are the pieces of wood. Those are the instructions.\n\n00:10:46.958 --> 00:10:49.958\nThese are the pieces, and here's a little of that blown up.\n\n00:10:49.958 --> 00:10:51.958\nWhat you can see is there's about six different colors,\n\n00:10:51.958 --> 00:10:55.958\nand each color represents a type of wood to be cut, a piece of wood to be cut.\n\n00:10:55.958 --> 00:10:58.958\nAll of which were delivered by flat bed, on a truck,\n\n00:10:58.958 --> 00:11:04.958\nand hand assembled in 48 hours by a team of eight people,\n\n00:11:04.958 --> 00:11:07.958\nonly one of whom had ever seen the plans before.\n\n00:11:07.958 --> 00:11:10.958\nOnly one of whom had ever seen the plans before.\n\n00:11:10.958 --> 00:11:13.958\nAnd here comes dune-scape, coming up out of the courtyard,\n\n00:11:13.958 --> 00:11:16.958\nand there it is fully built.\n\n00:11:16.958 --> 00:11:19.958\nThere are only 16 different pieces of wood,\n\n00:11:20.958 --> 00:11:23.958\nonly 16 different assembly parts here.\n\n00:11:23.958 --> 00:11:26.958\nLooks like a beautiful piano sounding board on the inside.\n\n00:11:26.958 --> 00:11:30.958\nIt has its own built-in swimming pool, very, very cool.\n\n00:11:30.958 --> 00:11:35.958\nIt's a great place for parties -- it was, it was only up for six weeks.\n\n00:11:35.958 --> 00:11:38.958\nIt's got little dressing rooms and cabanas,\n\n00:11:38.958 --> 00:11:41.958\nwhere lots of interesting things went on, all summer long.\n\n00:11:43.958 --> 00:11:48.958\nNow, lest you think that this is only for the light at heart, or just temporary installations,\n\n00:11:48.958 --> 00:11:51.958\nthis is the same firm working at the World Trade Center,\n\n00:11:51.958 --> 00:11:55.958\nreplacing the bridge that used to go across West Street,\n\n00:11:55.958 --> 00:11:57.958\nthat very important pedestrian connection\n\n00:11:57.958 --> 00:12:03.958\nbetween the city of New York and the redevelopment of the West Side.\n\n00:12:03.958 --> 00:12:06.958\nThey were asked to design, replace that bridge in six weeks,\n\n00:12:06.958 --> 00:12:10.958\nbuilding it, including all of the parts, manufactured.\n\n00:12:10.958 --> 00:12:12.958\nAnd they were able to do it. That was their design,\n\n00:12:12.958 --> 00:12:14.958\nusing that same computer modeling system\n\n00:12:14.958 --> 00:12:17.958\nand only five or six really different kinds of parts,\n\n00:12:17.958 --> 00:12:21.958\na couple of struts, like this, some exterior cladding material\n\n00:12:21.958 --> 00:12:23.958\nand a very simple framing system\n\n00:12:23.958 --> 00:12:25.958\nthat was all manufactured off-site and delivered by truck.\n\n00:12:25.958 --> 00:12:28.958\nThey were able to create that.\n\n00:12:28.958 --> 00:12:30.958\nThey were able to create something wonderful.\n\n00:12:30.958 --> 00:12:33.958\nThey're now building a 16-story building on the side of New York,\n\n00:12:33.958 --> 00:12:35.958\nusing the same technology.\n\n00:12:35.958 --> 00:12:37.958\nHere we're going to walk across the bridge at night.\n\n00:12:37.958 --> 00:12:39.958\nIt's self-lit, you don't need any overhead lighting,\n\n00:12:39.958 --> 00:12:42.958\nso the neighbors don't complain about metal-halide lighting in their face.\n\n00:12:42.958 --> 00:12:45.958\nHere it is going across. And there, down the other side,\n\n00:12:45.958 --> 00:12:47.958\nand you get the same kind of grandeur.\n\n00:12:47.958 --> 00:12:51.958\nNow, let me show you, quickly, the opposite, if I may.\n\n00:12:51.958 --> 00:12:54.958\nWoo, pretty, huh. This is the other side of the coin.\n\n00:12:54.958 --> 00:12:57.958\nThis is the work of David Rockwell from New York City,\n\n00:12:57.958 --> 00:12:59.958\nwhose work you can see out here today.\n\n00:12:59.958 --> 00:13:02.958\nThe current king of the romantics, who approaches his work\n\n00:13:02.958 --> 00:13:04.958\nin a very different fashion.\n\n00:13:04.958 --> 00:13:07.958\nIt's not to create a technological solution, it's to seduce you\n\n00:13:07.958 --> 00:13:11.958\ninto something that you can do, into something that will please you,\n\n00:13:11.958 --> 00:13:13.958\nsomething that will lift your spirits,\n\n00:13:13.958 --> 00:13:16.958\nsomething that will make you feel as if are in another world --\n\n00:13:16.958 --> 00:13:19.958\nsuch as his Nobu restaurant in New York,\n\n00:13:19.958 --> 00:13:23.958\nwhich is supposed to take you from the clutter of New York City\n\n00:13:23.958 --> 00:13:28.958\nto the simplicity of Japan and the elegance of Japanese tradition.\n\n00:13:28.958 --> 00:13:33.958\n\"When it's all said and done, it's got to look like seaweed,\" said the owner.\n\n00:13:33.958 --> 00:13:37.958\nOr his restaurant, Pod, in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.\n\n00:13:37.958 --> 00:13:40.958\nI want you to know the room you're looking at is stark white.\n\n00:13:40.958 --> 00:13:43.958\nEvery single surface of this restaurant is white.\n\n00:13:43.958 --> 00:13:48.958\nThe reason it has so much color is that it changes using lighting.\n\n00:13:48.958 --> 00:13:52.958\nIt's all about sensuality. It's all about transforming.\n\n00:13:52.958 --> 00:13:55.958\nWatch this -- I'm not touching any buttons, ladies and gentlemen.\n\n00:13:55.958 --> 00:13:57.958\nThis is happening by itself.\n\n00:13:57.958 --> 00:13:59.958\nIt transforms through the magic of lighting.\n\n00:13:59.958 --> 00:14:02.958\nIt's all about sensuality. It's all about touch.\n\n00:14:02.958 --> 00:14:07.958\nRosa Mexicano restaurant, where he transports us to the shores of Acapulco,\n\n00:14:07.958 --> 00:14:09.958\nup on the Upper West Side,\n\n00:14:09.958 --> 00:14:14.958\nwith this wall of cliff divers who -- there you go, like that.\n\n00:14:14.958 --> 00:14:16.958\nLet's see it one more time.\n\n00:14:16.958 --> 00:14:19.958\nOkay, just to make sure that you've enjoyed it.\n\n00:14:19.958 --> 00:14:23.958\nAnd finally, it's about comfort, it's about making you feel good\n\n00:14:23.958 --> 00:14:25.958\nin places that you wouldn't have felt good before.\n\n00:14:25.958 --> 00:14:27.958\nIt's about bringing nature to the inside.\n\n00:14:27.958 --> 00:14:31.958\nIn the Guardian Tower of New York, converted to a W Union Square --\n\n00:14:31.958 --> 00:14:36.958\nI'm sorry I'm rushing -- where we had to bring in the best horticulturists in the world\n\n00:14:36.958 --> 00:14:39.958\nto make sure that the interior of this dragged the garden space\n\n00:14:39.958 --> 00:14:43.958\nof the court garden of the Union Square into the building itself.\n\n00:14:43.958 --> 00:14:45.958\nIt's about stimulation.\n\n00:14:47.958 --> 00:14:52.958\nThis is a wine-buying experience simplified by color and taste.\n\n00:14:52.958 --> 00:14:56.958\nFizzy, fresh, soft, luscious, juicy, smooth, big and sweet wines,\n\n00:14:56.958 --> 00:15:00.958\nall explained to you by color and texture on the wall.\n\n00:15:00.958 --> 00:15:04.958\nAnd finally, it's about entertainment, as in his headquarters\n\n00:15:04.958 --> 00:15:06.958\nfor the Cirque du Soleil, Orlando, Florida,\n\n00:15:06.958 --> 00:15:08.958\nwhere you're asked to enter the Greek theater,\n\n00:15:08.958 --> 00:15:11.958\nlook under the tent and join the magic world of Cirque du Soleil.\n\n00:15:11.958 --> 00:15:14.958\nAnd I think I'll probably leave it at that. Thank you very much."}, {"title": "The next 5,000 days of the web", "duration": "1174", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/kevin_kelly_on_the_next_5_000_days_of_the_web", "transcript": "The Internet, the Web as we know it, the kind of Web \u2014 the things we're all talking about \u2014 is already less than 5,000 days old. So all of the things that we've seen come about, starting, say, with satellite images of the whole Earth, which we couldn't even imagine happening before, all these things rolling into our lives, just this abundance of things that are right before us, sitting in front of our laptop, or our desktop. This kind of cornucopia of stuff just coming and never ending is amazing, and we're not amazed. It's really amazing that all this stuff is here. (Laughter) It's in 5,000 days, all this stuff has come. And I know that 10 years ago, if I had told you that this was all coming, you would have said that that's impossible. There's simply no economic model that that would be possible. And if I told you it was all coming for free, you would say, this is simply \u2014 you're dreaming. You're a Californian utopian. You're a wild-eyed optimist. And yet it's here.The other thing that we know about it was that 10 years ago, as I looked at what even Wired was talking about, we thought it was going to be TV, but better. That was the model. That was what everybody was suggesting was going to be coming. And it turns out that that's not what it was. First of all, it was impossible, and it's not what it was. And so one of the things that I think we're learning \u2014 if you think about, like, Wikipedia, it's something that was simply impossible. It's impossible in theory, but possible in practice. And if you take all these things that are impossible, I think one of the things that we're learning from this era, from this last decade, is that we have to get good at believing in the impossible, because we're unprepared for it.So, I'm curious about what's going to happen in the next 5,000 days. But if that's happened in the last 5,000 days, what's going to happen in the next 5,000 days? So, I have a kind of a simple story, and it suggests that what we want to think about is this thing that we're making, this thing that has happened in 5,000 days \u2014 that's all these computers, all these handhelds, all these cell phones, all these laptops, all these servers \u2014 basically what we're getting out of all these connections is we're getting one machine. If there is only one machine, and our little handhelds and devices are actually just little windows into those machines, but that we're basically constructing a single, global machine.And so I began to think about that. And it turned out that this machine happens to be the most reliable machine that we've ever made. It has not crashed; it's running uninterrupted. And there's almost no other machine that we've ever made that runs the number of hours, the number of days. 5,000 days without interruption \u2014 that's just unbelievable. And of course, the Internet is longer than just 5,000 days; the Web is only 5,000 days. So, I was trying to basically make measurements. What are the dimensions of this machine? And I started off by calculating how many billions of clicks there are all around the globe on all the computers. And there is a 100 billion clicks per day. And there's 55 trillion links between all the Web pages of the world.And so I began thinking more about other kinds of dimensions, and I made a quick list. Was it Chris Jordan, the photographer, talking about numbers being so large that they're meaningless? Well, here's a list of them. They're hard to tell, but there's one billion PC chips on the Internet, if you count all the chips in all the computers on the Internet. There's two million emails per second. So it's a very big number. It's just a huge machine, and it uses five percent of the global electricity on the planet. So here's the specifications, just as if you were to make up a spec sheet for it: 170 quadrillion transistors, 55 trillion links, emails running at two megahertz itself, 31 kilohertz text messaging, 246 exabyte storage. That's a big disk. That's a lot of storage, memory. Nine exabyte RAM. And the total traffic on this is running at seven terabytes per second. Brewster was saying the Library of Congress is about twenty terabytes. So every second, half of the Library of Congress is swooshing around in this machine. It's a big machine.So I did something else. I figured out 100 billion clicks per day, 55 trillion links is almost the same as the number of synapses in your brain. A quadrillion transistors is almost the same as the number of neurons in your brain. So to a first approximation, we have these things \u2014 twenty petahertz synapse firings. Of course, the memory is really huge. But to a first approximation, the size of this machine is the size \u2014 and its complexity, kind of \u2014 to your brain. Because in fact, that's how your brain works \u2014 in kind of the same way that the Web works. However, your brain isn't doubling every two years. So if we say this machine right now that we've made is about one HB, one human brain, if we look at the rate that this is increasing, 30 years from now, there'll be six billion HBs. So by the year 2040, the total processing of this machine will exceed a total processing power of humanity,in raw bits and stuff. And this is, I think, where Ray Kurzweil and others get this little chart saying that we're going to cross. So, what about that? Well, here's a couple of things. I have three kind of general things I would like to say, three consequences of this. First, that basically what this machine is doing is embodying. We're giving it a body. And that's what we're going to do in the next 5,000 days \u2014 we're going to give this machine a body. And the second thing is, we're going to restructure its architecture. And thirdly, we're going to become completely codependent upon it.So let me go through those three things. First of all, we have all these things in our hands. We think they're all separate devices, but in fact, every screen in the world is looking into the one machine. These are all basically portals into that one machine. The second thing is that \u2014 some people call this the cloud, and you're kind of touching the cloud with this. And so in some ways, all you really need is a cloudbook. And the cloudbook doesn't have any storage. It's wireless. It's always connected. There's many things about it. It becomes very simple, and basically what you're doing is you're just touching the machine, you're touching the cloud and you're going to compute that way. So the machine is computing.And in some ways, it's sort of back to the kind of old idea of centralized computing. But everything, all the cameras, and the microphones, and the sensors in cars and everything is connected to this machine. And everything will go through the Web. And we're seeing that already with, say, phones. Right now, phones don't go through the Web, but they are beginning to, and they will. And if you imagine what, say, just as an example, what Google Labs has in terms of experiments with Google Docs, Google Spreadsheets, blah, blah, blah \u2014 all these things are going to become Web based. They're going through the machine. And I am suggesting that every bit will be owned by the Web. Right now, it's not. If you do spreadsheets and things at work, a Word document, they aren't on the Web, but they are going to be. They're going to be part of this machine. They're going to speak the Web language. They're going to talk to the machine. The Web, in some sense, is kind of like a black hole that's sucking up everything into it. And so every thing will be part of the Web. So every item, every artifact that we make, will have embedded in it some little sliver of Web-ness and connection, and it will be part of this machine, so that our environment \u2014 kind of in that ubiquitous computing sense \u2014 our environment becomes the Web. Everything is connected.Now, with RFIDs and other things \u2014 whatever technology it is, it doesn't really matter. The point is that everything will have embedded in it some sensor connecting it to the machine, and so we have, basically, an Internet of things. So you begin to think of a shoe as a chip with heels, and a car as a chip with wheels, because basically most of the cost of manufacturing cars is the embedded intelligence and electronics in it, and not the materials. A lot of people think about the new economy as something that was going to be a disembodied, alternative, virtual existence, and that we would have the old economy of atoms. But in fact, what the new economy really is is the marriage of those two, where we embed the information, and the digital nature of things into the material world. That's what we're looking forward to. That is where we're going \u2014 this union, this convergence of the atomic and the digital.And so one of the consequences of that, I believe, is that where we have this sort of spectrum of media right now \u2014 TV, film, video \u2014 that basically becomes one media platform. And while there's many differences in some senses, they will share more and more in common with each other. So that the laws of media, such as the fact that copies have no value, the value's in the uncopiable things, the immediacy, the authentication, the personalization. The media wants to be liquid. The reason why things are free is so that you can manipulate them, not so that they are \"free\" as in \"beer,\" but \"free\" as in \"freedom.\" And the network effects rule, meaning that the more you have, the more you get. The first fax machine \u2014 the person who bought the first fax machine was an idiot, because there was nobody to fax to. But here she became an evangelist, recruiting others to get the fax machines because it made their purchase more valuable. Those are the effects that we're going to see. Attention is the currency.So those laws are going to kind of spread throughout all media. And the other thing about this embodiment is that there's kind of what I call the McLuhan reversal. McLuhan was saying, \"Machines are the extensions of the human senses.\" And I'm saying, \"Humans are now going to be the extended senses of the machine,\" in a certain sense. So we have a trillion eyes, and ears, and touches, through all our digital photographs and cameras. And we see that in things like Flickr, or Photosynth, this program from Microsoft that will allow you to assemble a view of a touristy place from the thousands of tourist snapshots of it. In a certain sense, the machine is seeing through the pixels of individual cameras.Now, the second thing that I want to talk about was this idea of restructuring, that what the Web is doing is restructuring. And I have to warn you, that what we'll talk about is \u2014 I'm going to give my explanation of a term you're hearing, which is a \"semantic Web.\"So first of all, the first stage that we've seen of the Internet was that it was going to link computers. And that's what we called the Net; that was the Internet of nets. And we saw that, where you have all the computers of the world. And if you remember, it was a kind of green screen with cursors, and there was really not much to do, and if you wanted to connect it, you connected it from one computer to another computer. And what you had to do was \u2014 if you wanted to participate in this, you had to share packets of information. So you were forwarding on. You didn't have control. It wasn't like a telephone system where you had control of a line: you had to share packets.The second stage that we're in now is the idea of linking pages. So in the old one, if I wanted to go on to an airline Web page, I went from my computer, to an FTP site, to another airline computer. Now we have pages \u2014 the unit has been resolved into pages, so one page links to another page. And if I want to go in to book a flight, I go into the airline's flight page, the website of the airline, and I'm linking to that page. And what we're sharing were links, so you had to be kind of open with links. You couldn't deny \u2014 if someone wanted to link to you, you couldn't stop them. You had to participate in this idea of opening up your pages to be linked by anybody. So that's what we were doing.We're now entering to the third stage, which is what I'm talking about, and that is where we link the data. So, I don't know what the name of this thing is. I'm calling it the one machine. But we're linking data. So we're going from machine to machine, from page to page, and now data to data. So the difference is, is that rather than linking from page to page, we're actually going to link from one idea on a page to another idea, rather than to the other page. So every idea is basically being supported \u2014 or every item, or every noun \u2014 is being supported by the entire Web. It's being resolved at the level of items, or ideas, or words, if you want. So besides physically coming out again into this idea that it's not just virtual, it's actually going out to things. So something will resolve down to the information about a particular person, so every person will have a unique ID. Every person, every item will have a something that will be very specific, and will link to a specific representation of that idea or item. So now, in this new one, when I link to it, I would link to my particular flight, my particular seat. And so, giving an example of this thing, I live in Pacifica, rather than \u2014 right now Pacifica is just sort of a name on the Web somewhere. The Web doesn't know that that is actually a town, and that it's a specific town that I live in, but that's what we're going to be talking about. It's going to link directly to \u2014 it will know, the Web will be able to read itself and know that that actually is a place, and that whenever it sees that word, \"Pacifica,\" it knows that it actually has a place, latitude, longitude, a certain population.So here are some of the technical terms, all three-letter things, that you'll see a lot more of. All these things are about enabling this idea of linking to the data. So I'll give you one kind of an example. There's like a billion social sites on the Web. Each time you go into there, you have to tell it again who you are and all your friends are. Why should you be doing that? You should just do that once, and it should know who all your friends are. So that's what you want, is all your friends are identified, and you should just carry these relationships around. All this data about you should just be conveyed, and you should do it once and that's all that should happen. And you should have all the networks of all the relationships between those pieces of data. That's what we're moving into \u2014 where it sort of knows these things down to that level. A semantic Web, Web 3.0, giant global graph \u2014 we're kind of trying out what we want to call this thing. But what's it's doing is sharing data. So you have to be open to having your data shared, which is a much bigger step than just sharing your Web page, or your computer. And all these things that are going to be on this are not just pages, they are things. Everything we've described, every artifact or place, will be a specific representation, will have a specific character that can be linked to directly. So we have this database of things. And so there's actually a fourth thing that we have not get to, that we won't see in the next 10 years, or 5,000 days, but I think that's where we're going to. And as the Internet of things \u2014 where I'm linking directly to the particular things of my seat on the plane \u2014 that that physical thing becomes part of the Web. And so we are in the middle of this thing that's completely linked, down to every object in the little sliver of a connection that it has.So, the last thing I want to talk about is this idea that we're going to be codependent. It's always going to be there, and the closer it is, the better. If you allow Google to, it will tell you your search history. And I found out by looking at it that I search most at 11 o'clock in the morning. So I am open, and being transparent to that. And I think total personalization in this new world will require total transparency. That is going to be the price. If you want to have total personalization, you have to be totally transparent. Google. I can't remember my phone number, I'll just ask Google. We're so dependent on this that I have now gotten to the point where I don't even try to remember things \u2014 I'll just Google it. It's easier to do that. And we kind of object at first, saying, \"Oh, that's awful.\" But if we think about the dependency that we have on this other technology, called the alphabet, and writing, we're totally dependent on it, and it's transformed culture. We cannot imagine ourselves without the alphabet and writing. And so in the same way, we're going to not imagine ourselves without this other machine being there. And what is happening with this is some kind of AI, but it's not the AI in conscious AI, as being an expert, Larry Page told me that that's what they're trying to do, and that's what they're trying to do. But when six billion humans are Googling, who's searching who? It goes both ways. So we are the Web, that's what this thing is. We are going to be the machine. So the next 5,000 days, it's not going to be the Web and only better. Just like it wasn't TV and only better. The next 5,000 days, it's not just going to be the Web but only better \u2014 it's going to be something different. And I think it's going to be smarter. It'll have an intelligence in there, that's not, again, conscious. But it'll anticipate what we're doing, in a good sense. Secondly, it's become much more personalized. It will know us, and that's good. And again, the price of that will be transparency. And thirdly, it's going to become more ubiquitous in terms of filling your entire environment, and we will be in the middle of it. And all these devices will be portals into that.So the single idea that I wanted to leave with you is that we have to begin to think about this as not just \"the Web, only better,\" but a new kind of stage in this development. It looks more global. If you take this whole thing, it is a very big machine, very reliable machine, more reliable than its parts. But we can also think about it as kind of a large organism. So we might respond to it more as if this was a whole system, more as if this wasn't a large organism that we are going to be interacting with. It's a \"One.\" And I don't know what else to call it, than the One. We'll have a better word for it. But there's a unity of some sort that's starting to emerge. And again, I don't want to talk about consciousness, I want to talk about it just as if it was a little bacteria, or a volvox, which is what that organism is.So, to do, action, take-away. So, here's what I would say: there's only one machine, and the Web is its OS. All screens look into the One. No bits will live outside the Web. To share is to gain. Let the One read it. It's going to be machine-readable. You want to make something that the machine can read. And the One is us. We are in the One. I appreciate your time.

You're a wild-eyed optimist.\n\n00:01:19.958 --> 00:01:21.958\nAnd yet it's here.\n\n00:01:21.958 --> 00:01:25.958\nThe other thing that we know about it was that 10 years ago,\n\n00:01:25.958 --> 00:01:28.958\nas I looked at what even Wired was talking about,\n\n00:01:28.958 --> 00:01:31.958\nwe thought it was going to be TV, but better.\n\n00:01:31.958 --> 00:01:35.958\nThat was the model. That was what everybody was suggesting\n\n00:01:35.958 --> 00:01:37.958\nwas going to be coming.\n\n00:01:37.958 --> 00:01:40.958\nAnd it turns out that that's not what it was.\n\n00:01:40.958 --> 00:01:43.958\nFirst of all, it was impossible, and it's not what it was.\n\n00:01:43.958 --> 00:01:44.958\nAnd so one of the things that I think we're learning --\n\n00:01:44.958 --> 00:01:46.958\nif you think about, like, Wikipedia,\n\n00:01:46.958 --> 00:01:48.958\nit's something that was simply impossible.\n\n00:01:48.958 --> 00:01:52.958\nIt's impossible in theory, but possible in practice.\n\n00:01:52.958 --> 00:01:53.958\nAnd if you take all these things that are impossible,\n\n00:01:53.958 --> 00:01:57.958\nI think one of the things that we're learning from this era,\n\n00:01:57.958 --> 00:02:01.958\nfrom this last decade, is that we have to get good at believing in the impossible,\n\n00:02:01.958 --> 00:02:04.958\nbecause we're unprepared for it.\n\n00:02:04.958 --> 00:02:07.958\nSo, I'm curious about what's going to happen in the next 5,000 days.\n\n00:02:07.958 --> 00:02:09.958\nBut if that's happened in the last 5,000 days,\n\n00:02:09.958 --> 00:02:12.958\nwhat's going to happen in the next 5,000 days?\n\n00:02:12.958 --> 00:02:15.958\nSo, I have a kind of a simple story,\n\n00:02:15.958 --> 00:02:18.958\nand it suggests that what we want to think about is this thing that we're making,\n\n00:02:18.958 --> 00:02:20.958\nthis thing that has happened in 5,000 days --\n\n00:02:20.958 --> 00:02:23.958\nthat's all these computers, all these handhelds,\n\n00:02:23.958 --> 00:02:27.958\nall these cell phones, all these laptops, all these servers --\n\n00:02:27.958 --> 00:02:31.958\nbasically what we're getting out of all these connections\n\n00:02:31.958 --> 00:02:33.958\nis we're getting one machine.\n\n00:02:33.958 --> 00:02:37.958\nIf there is only one machine, and our little handhelds and devices\n\n00:02:37.958 --> 00:02:39.958\nare actually just little windows into those machines,\n\n00:02:39.958 --> 00:02:45.958\nbut that we're basically constructing a single, global machine.\n\n00:02:45.958 --> 00:02:47.958\nAnd so I began to think about that.\n\n00:02:47.958 --> 00:02:50.958\nAnd it turned out that this machine happens to be\n\n00:02:50.958 --> 00:02:53.958\nthe most reliable machine that we've ever made.\n\n00:02:53.958 --> 00:02:55.958\nIt has not crashed; it's running uninterrupted.\n\n00:02:55.958 --> 00:02:58.958\nAnd there's almost no other machine that we've ever made\n\n00:02:58.958 --> 00:03:02.958\nthat runs the number of hours, the number of days.\n\n00:03:02.958 --> 00:03:05.958\n5,000 days without interruption -- that's just unbelievable.\n\n00:03:05.958 --> 00:03:07.958\nAnd of course, the Internet is longer than just 5,000 days;\n\n00:03:07.958 --> 00:03:09.958\nthe Web is only 5,000 days.\n\n00:03:09.958 --> 00:03:15.958\nSo, I was trying to basically make measurements.\n\n00:03:15.958 --> 00:03:18.958\nWhat are the dimensions of this machine?\n\n00:03:18.958 --> 00:03:22.958\nAnd I started off by calculating how many billions of clicks there are\n\n00:03:22.958 --> 00:03:25.958\nall around the globe on all the computers.\n\n00:03:25.958 --> 00:03:27.958\nAnd there is a 100 billion clicks per day.\n\n00:03:27.958 --> 00:03:33.958\nAnd there's 55 trillion links between all the Web pages of the world.\n\n00:03:33.958 --> 00:03:36.958\nAnd so I began thinking more about other kinds of dimensions,\n\n00:03:36.958 --> 00:03:41.958\nand I made a quick list. Was it Chris Jordan, the photographer,\n\n00:03:41.958 --> 00:03:45.958\ntalking about numbers being so large that they're meaningless?\n\n00:03:45.958 --> 00:03:47.958\nWell, here's a list of them. They're hard to tell,\n\n00:03:47.958 --> 00:03:51.958\nbut there's one billion PC chips on the Internet,\n\n00:03:51.958 --> 00:03:53.958\nif you count all the chips in all the computers on the Internet.\n\n00:03:53.958 --> 00:03:55.958\nThere's two million emails per second.\n\n00:03:55.958 --> 00:03:57.958\nSo it's a very big number.\n\n00:03:57.958 --> 00:03:59.958\nIt's just a huge machine,\n\n00:03:59.958 --> 00:04:03.958\nand it uses five percent of the global electricity on the planet.\n\n00:04:03.958 --> 00:04:04.958\nSo here's the specifications,\n\n00:04:04.958 --> 00:04:06.958\njust as if you were to make up a spec sheet for it:\n\n00:04:06.958 --> 00:04:10.958\n170 quadrillion transistors, 55 trillion links,\n\n00:04:10.958 --> 00:04:12.958\nemails running at two megahertz itself,\n\n00:04:12.958 --> 00:04:15.958\n31 kilohertz text messaging,\n\n00:04:15.958 --> 00:04:19.958\n246 exabyte storage. That's a big disk.\n\n00:04:19.958 --> 00:04:22.958\nThat's a lot of storage, memory. Nine exabyte RAM.\n\n00:04:22.958 --> 00:04:26.958\nAnd the total traffic on this\n\n00:04:26.958 --> 00:04:29.958\nis running at seven terabytes per second.\n\n00:04:29.958 --> 00:04:32.958\nBrewster was saying the Library of Congress is about twenty terabytes.\n\n00:04:32.958 --> 00:04:35.958\nSo every second, half of the Library of Congress\n\n00:04:35.958 --> 00:04:39.958\nis swooshing around in this machine. It's a big machine.\n\n00:04:39.958 --> 00:04:43.958\nSo I did something else. I figured out 100 billion clicks per day,\n\n00:04:43.958 --> 00:04:46.958\n55 trillion links is almost the same\n\n00:04:46.958 --> 00:04:48.958\nas the number of synapses in your brain.\n\n00:04:48.958 --> 00:04:50.958\nA quadrillion transistors is almost the same\n\n00:04:50.958 --> 00:04:52.958\nas the number of neurons in your brain.\n\n00:04:52.958 --> 00:04:55.958\nSo to a first approximation, we have these things --\n\n00:04:55.958 --> 00:04:57.958\ntwenty petahertz synapse firings.\n\n00:04:57.958 --> 00:04:59.958\nOf course, the memory is really huge.\n\n00:04:59.958 --> 00:05:05.958\nBut to a first approximation, the size of this machine is the size --\n\n00:05:05.958 --> 00:05:10.958\nand its complexity, kind of -- to your brain.\n\n00:05:10.958 --> 00:05:14.958\nBecause in fact, that's how your brain works -- in kind of the same way that the Web works.\n\n00:05:14.958 --> 00:05:18.958\nHowever, your brain isn't doubling every two years.\n\n00:05:18.958 --> 00:05:23.958\nSo if we say this machine right now that we've made\n\n00:05:23.958 --> 00:05:26.958\nis about one HB, one human brain,\n\n00:05:26.958 --> 00:05:29.958\nif we look at the rate that this is increasing,\n\n00:05:29.958 --> 00:05:34.958\n30 years from now, there'll be six billion HBs.\n\n00:05:34.958 --> 00:05:38.958\nSo by the year 2040, the total processing of this machine\n\n00:05:38.958 --> 00:05:41.958\nwill exceed a total processing power of humanity,\n\n00:05:41.958 --> 00:05:44.958\nin raw bits and stuff. And this is, I think, where\n\n00:05:44.958 --> 00:05:49.958\nRay Kurzweil and others get this little chart saying that we're going to cross.\n\n00:05:49.958 --> 00:05:55.958\nSo, what about that? Well, here's a couple of things.\n\n00:05:55.958 --> 00:05:58.958\nI have three kind of general things\n\n00:05:58.958 --> 00:06:02.958\nI would like to say, three consequences of this.\n\n00:06:02.958 --> 00:06:07.958\nFirst, that basically what this machine is doing is embodying.\n\n00:06:07.958 --> 00:06:09.958\nWe're giving it a body. And that's what we're going to do\n\n00:06:09.958 --> 00:06:12.958\nin the next 5,000 days -- we're going to give this machine a body.\n\n00:06:12.958 --> 00:06:15.958\nAnd the second thing is, we're going to restructure its architecture.\n\n00:06:15.958 --> 00:06:19.958\nAnd thirdly, we're going to become completely codependent upon it.\n\n00:06:19.958 --> 00:06:21.958\nSo let me go through those three things.\n\n00:06:21.958 --> 00:06:24.958\nFirst of all, we have all these things in our hands.\n\n00:06:24.958 --> 00:06:26.958\nWe think they're all separate devices,\n\n00:06:26.958 --> 00:06:29.958\nbut in fact, every screen in the world\n\n00:06:29.958 --> 00:06:32.958\nis looking into the one machine.\n\n00:06:32.958 --> 00:06:35.958\nThese are all basically portals into that one machine.\n\n00:06:35.958 --> 00:06:39.958\nThe second thing is that -- some people call this the cloud,\n\n00:06:39.958 --> 00:06:41.958\nand you're kind of touching the cloud with this.\n\n00:06:41.958 --> 00:06:45.958\nAnd so in some ways, all you really need is a cloudbook.\n\n00:06:45.958 --> 00:06:48.958\nAnd the cloudbook doesn't have any storage.\n\n00:06:48.958 --> 00:06:51.958\nIt's wireless. It's always connected.\n\n00:06:51.958 --> 00:06:53.958\nThere's many things about it. It becomes very simple,\n\n00:06:53.958 --> 00:06:55.958\nand basically what you're doing is you're just touching the machine,\n\n00:06:55.958 --> 00:06:58.958\nyou're touching the cloud and you're going to compute that way.\n\n00:06:58.958 --> 00:07:00.958\nSo the machine is computing.\n\n00:07:00.958 --> 00:07:01.958\nAnd in some ways, it's sort of back\n\n00:07:01.958 --> 00:07:04.958\nto the kind of old idea of centralized computing.\n\n00:07:04.958 --> 00:07:08.958\nBut everything, all the cameras, and the microphones,\n\n00:07:08.958 --> 00:07:12.958\nand the sensors in cars\n\n00:07:12.958 --> 00:07:14.958\nand everything is connected to this machine.\n\n00:07:14.958 --> 00:07:16.958\nAnd everything will go through the Web.\n\n00:07:16.958 --> 00:07:18.958\nAnd we're seeing that already with, say, phones.\n\n00:07:18.958 --> 00:07:20.958\nRight now, phones don't go through the Web,\n\n00:07:20.958 --> 00:07:23.958\nbut they are beginning to, and they will.\n\n00:07:23.958 --> 00:07:27.958\nAnd if you imagine what, say, just as an example, what Google Labs has\n\n00:07:27.958 --> 00:07:31.958\nin terms of experiments with Google Docs, Google Spreadsheets, blah, blah, blah --\n\n00:07:31.958 --> 00:07:34.958\nall these things are going to become Web based.\n\n00:07:34.958 --> 00:07:36.958\nThey're going through the machine.\n\n00:07:36.958 --> 00:07:41.958\nAnd I am suggesting that every bit will be owned by the Web.\n\n00:07:41.958 --> 00:07:44.958\nRight now, it's not. If you do spreadsheets and things at work,\n\n00:07:44.958 --> 00:07:47.958\na Word document, they aren't on the Web,\n\n00:07:47.958 --> 00:07:49.958\nbut they are going to be. They're going to be part of this machine.\n\n00:07:49.958 --> 00:07:51.958\nThey're going to speak the Web language.\n\n00:07:51.958 --> 00:07:53.958\nThey're going to talk to the machine.\n\n00:07:53.958 --> 00:07:56.958\nThe Web, in some sense, is kind of like a black hole\n\n00:07:56.958 --> 00:07:59.958\nthat's sucking up everything into it.\n\n00:07:59.958 --> 00:08:03.958\nAnd so every thing will be part of the Web.\n\n00:08:03.958 --> 00:08:08.958\nSo every item, every artifact that we make, will have embedded in it\n\n00:08:08.958 --> 00:08:11.958\nsome little sliver of Web-ness and connection,\n\n00:08:11.958 --> 00:08:13.958\nand it will be part of this machine,\n\n00:08:13.958 --> 00:08:16.958\nso that our environment -- kind of in that ubiquitous computing sense --\n\n00:08:16.958 --> 00:08:21.958\nour environment becomes the Web. Everything is connected.\n\n00:08:21.958 --> 00:08:24.958\nNow, with RFIDs and other things -- whatever technology it is,\n\n00:08:24.958 --> 00:08:27.958\nit doesn't really matter. The point is that everything\n\n00:08:27.958 --> 00:08:30.958\nwill have embedded in it some sensor connecting it to the machine,\n\n00:08:30.958 --> 00:08:33.958\nand so we have, basically, an Internet of things.\n\n00:08:33.958 --> 00:08:37.958\nSo you begin to think of a shoe as a chip with heels,\n\n00:08:37.958 --> 00:08:40.958\nand a car as a chip with wheels,\n\n00:08:40.958 --> 00:08:43.958\nbecause basically most of the cost of manufacturing cars\n\n00:08:43.958 --> 00:08:49.958\nis the embedded intelligence and electronics in it, and not the materials.\n\n00:08:49.958 --> 00:08:51.958\nA lot of people think about the new economy\n\n00:08:51.958 --> 00:08:53.958\nas something that was going to be a disembodied,\n\n00:08:53.958 --> 00:08:56.958\nalternative, virtual existence,\n\n00:08:56.958 --> 00:08:59.958\nand that we would have the old economy of atoms.\n\n00:08:59.958 --> 00:09:02.958\nBut in fact, what the new economy really is\n\n00:09:02.958 --> 00:09:06.958\nis the marriage of those two, where we embed the information,\n\n00:09:06.958 --> 00:09:08.958\nand the digital nature of things into the material world.\n\n00:09:08.958 --> 00:09:12.958\nThat's what we're looking forward to. That is where we're going --\n\n00:09:12.958 --> 00:09:19.958\nthis union, this convergence of the atomic and the digital.\n\n00:09:19.958 --> 00:09:21.958\nAnd so one of the consequences of that, I believe,\n\n00:09:21.958 --> 00:09:25.958\nis that where we have this sort of spectrum of media right now --\n\n00:09:25.958 --> 00:09:28.958\nTV, film, video -- that basically becomes one media platform.\n\n00:09:28.958 --> 00:09:30.958\nAnd while there's many differences in some senses,\n\n00:09:30.958 --> 00:09:33.958\nthey will share more and more in common with each other.\n\n00:09:33.958 --> 00:09:38.958\nSo that the laws of media, such as the fact that copies have no value,\n\n00:09:38.958 --> 00:09:40.958\nthe value's in the uncopiable things,\n\n00:09:40.958 --> 00:09:45.958\nthe immediacy, the authentication, the personalization.\n\n00:09:45.958 --> 00:09:48.958\nThe media wants to be liquid.\n\n00:09:48.958 --> 00:09:51.958\nThe reason why things are free is so that you can manipulate them,\n\n00:09:51.958 --> 00:09:55.958\nnot so that they are \"free\" as in \"beer,\" but \"free\" as in \"freedom.\"\n\n00:09:55.958 --> 00:09:57.958\nAnd the network effects rule,\n\n00:09:57.958 --> 00:09:59.958\nmeaning that the more you have, the more you get.\n\n00:09:59.958 --> 00:10:02.958\nThe first fax machine -- the person who bought the first fax machine\n\n00:10:02.958 --> 00:10:07.958\nwas an idiot, because there was nobody to fax to.\n\n00:10:07.958 --> 00:10:11.958\nBut here she became an evangelist, recruiting others\n\n00:10:11.958 --> 00:10:14.958\nto get the fax machines because it made their purchase more valuable.\n\n00:10:14.958 --> 00:10:16.958\nThose are the effects that we're going to see.\n\n00:10:16.958 --> 00:10:18.958\nAttention is the currency.\n\n00:10:18.958 --> 00:10:23.958\nSo those laws are going to kind of spread throughout all media.\n\n00:10:23.958 --> 00:10:25.958\nAnd the other thing about this embodiment\n\n00:10:25.958 --> 00:10:28.958\nis that there's kind of what I call the McLuhan reversal.\n\n00:10:28.958 --> 00:10:30.958\nMcLuhan was saying, \"Machines are the extensions of the human senses.\"\n\n00:10:30.958 --> 00:10:32.958\nAnd I'm saying, \"Humans are now going to be\n\n00:10:32.958 --> 00:10:35.958\nthe extended senses of the machine,\" in a certain sense.\n\n00:10:35.958 --> 00:10:39.958\nSo we have a trillion eyes, and ears, and touches,\n\n00:10:39.958 --> 00:10:42.958\nthrough all our digital photographs and cameras.\n\n00:10:42.958 --> 00:10:47.958\nAnd we see that in things like Flickr,\n\n00:10:47.958 --> 00:10:50.958\nor Photosynth, this program from Microsoft\n\n00:10:50.958 --> 00:10:54.958\nthat will allow you to assemble a view of a touristy place\n\n00:10:54.958 --> 00:10:58.958\nfrom the thousands of tourist snapshots of it.\n\n00:10:58.958 --> 00:11:04.958\nIn a certain sense, the machine is seeing through the pixels of individual cameras.\n\n00:11:04.958 --> 00:11:08.958\nNow, the second thing that I want to talk about was this idea of restructuring,\n\n00:11:08.958 --> 00:11:10.958\nthat what the Web is doing is restructuring.\n\n00:11:10.958 --> 00:11:12.958\nAnd I have to warn you, that what we'll talk about is --\n\n00:11:12.958 --> 00:11:16.958\nI'm going to give my explanation of a term you're hearing, which is a \"semantic Web.\"\n\n00:11:16.958 --> 00:11:19.958\nSo first of all, the first stage that we've seen\n\n00:11:19.958 --> 00:11:22.958\nof the Internet was that it was going to link computers.\n\n00:11:22.958 --> 00:11:25.958\nAnd that's what we called the Net; that was the Internet of nets.\n\n00:11:25.958 --> 00:11:28.958\nAnd we saw that, where you have all the computers of the world.\n\n00:11:28.958 --> 00:11:32.958\nAnd if you remember, it was a kind of green screen with cursors,\n\n00:11:32.958 --> 00:11:34.958\nand there was really not much to do, and if you wanted to connect it,\n\n00:11:34.958 --> 00:11:37.958\nyou connected it from one computer to another computer.\n\n00:11:37.958 --> 00:11:39.958\nAnd what you had to do was -- if you wanted to participate in this,\n\n00:11:39.958 --> 00:11:43.958\nyou had to share packets of information.\n\n00:11:43.958 --> 00:11:45.958\nSo you were forwarding on. You didn't have control.\n\n00:11:45.958 --> 00:11:47.958\nIt wasn't like a telephone system where you had control of a line:\n\n00:11:47.958 --> 00:11:49.958\nyou had to share packets.\n\n00:11:49.958 --> 00:11:54.958\nThe second stage that we're in now is the idea of linking pages.\n\n00:11:54.958 --> 00:11:57.958\nSo in the old one, if I wanted to go on to an airline Web page,\n\n00:11:57.958 --> 00:12:01.958\nI went from my computer, to an FTP site, to another airline computer.\n\n00:12:01.958 --> 00:12:06.958\nNow we have pages -- the unit has been resolved into pages,\n\n00:12:06.958 --> 00:12:08.958\nso one page links to another page.\n\n00:12:08.958 --> 00:12:11.958\nAnd if I want to go in to book a flight,\n\n00:12:11.958 --> 00:12:16.958\nI go into the airline's flight page, the website of the airline,\n\n00:12:16.958 --> 00:12:18.958\nand I'm linking to that page.\n\n00:12:18.958 --> 00:12:22.958\nAnd what we're sharing were links, so you had to be kind of open with links.\n\n00:12:22.958 --> 00:12:24.958\nYou couldn't deny -- if someone wanted to link to you,\n\n00:12:24.958 --> 00:12:28.958\nyou couldn't stop them. You had to participate in this idea\n\n00:12:28.958 --> 00:12:31.958\nof opening up your pages to be linked by anybody.\n\n00:12:31.958 --> 00:12:33.958\nSo that's what we were doing.\n\n00:12:33.958 --> 00:12:37.958\nWe're now entering to the third stage, which is what I'm talking about,\n\n00:12:37.958 --> 00:12:39.958\nand that is where we link the data.\n\n00:12:39.958 --> 00:12:41.958\nSo, I don't know what the name of this thing is.\n\n00:12:41.958 --> 00:12:43.958\nI'm calling it the one machine. But we're linking data.\n\n00:12:43.958 --> 00:12:45.958\nSo we're going from machine to machine,\n\n00:12:45.958 --> 00:12:47.958\nfrom page to page, and now data to data.\n\n00:12:47.958 --> 00:12:51.958\nSo the difference is, is that rather than linking from page to page,\n\n00:12:51.958 --> 00:12:55.958\nwe're actually going to link from one idea on a page\n\n00:12:55.958 --> 00:12:57.958\nto another idea, rather than to the other page.\n\n00:12:57.958 --> 00:13:00.958\nSo every idea is basically being supported --\n\n00:13:00.958 --> 00:13:03.958\nor every item, or every noun -- is being supported by the entire Web.\n\n00:13:03.958 --> 00:13:09.958\nIt's being resolved at the level of items, or ideas, or words, if you want.\n\n00:13:09.958 --> 00:13:13.958\nSo besides physically coming out again into this idea\n\n00:13:13.958 --> 00:13:17.958\nthat it's not just virtual, it's actually going out to things.\n\n00:13:17.958 --> 00:13:20.958\nSo something will resolve down to the information\n\n00:13:20.958 --> 00:13:24.958\nabout a particular person, so every person will have a unique ID.\n\n00:13:24.958 --> 00:13:26.958\nEvery person, every item will have a something\n\n00:13:26.958 --> 00:13:28.958\nthat will be very specific, and will link\n\n00:13:28.958 --> 00:13:32.958\nto a specific representation of that idea or item.\n\n00:13:32.958 --> 00:13:35.958\nSo now, in this new one, when I link to it,\n\n00:13:35.958 --> 00:13:41.958\nI would link to my particular flight, my particular seat.\n\n00:13:41.958 --> 00:13:44.958\nAnd so, giving an example of this thing,\n\n00:13:44.958 --> 00:13:46.958\nI live in Pacifica, rather than -- right now Pacifica\n\n00:13:46.958 --> 00:13:49.958\nis just sort of a name on the Web somewhere.\n\n00:13:49.958 --> 00:13:51.958\nThe Web doesn't know that that is actually a town,\n\n00:13:51.958 --> 00:13:53.958\nand that it's a specific town that I live in,\n\n00:13:53.958 --> 00:13:56.958\nbut that's what we're going to be talking about.\n\n00:13:56.958 --> 00:13:58.958\nIt's going to link directly to --\n\n00:13:58.958 --> 00:14:01.958\nit will know, the Web will be able to read itself\n\n00:14:01.958 --> 00:14:03.958\nand know that that actually is a place,\n\n00:14:03.958 --> 00:14:05.958\nand that whenever it sees that word, \"Pacifica,\"\n\n00:14:05.958 --> 00:14:06.958\nit knows that it actually has a place,\n\n00:14:06.958 --> 00:14:09.958\nlatitude, longitude, a certain population.\n\n00:14:09.958 --> 00:14:12.958\nSo here are some of the technical terms, all three-letter things,\n\n00:14:12.958 --> 00:14:14.958\nthat you'll see a lot more of.\n\n00:14:14.958 --> 00:14:19.958\nAll these things are about enabling this idea of linking to the data.\n\n00:14:19.958 --> 00:14:22.958\nSo I'll give you one kind of an example.\n\n00:14:22.958 --> 00:14:26.958\nThere's like a billion social sites on the Web.\n\n00:14:26.958 --> 00:14:29.958\nEach time you go into there, you have to tell it again who you are\n\n00:14:29.958 --> 00:14:30.958\nand all your friends are.\n\n00:14:30.958 --> 00:14:32.958\nWhy should you be doing that? You should just do that once,\n\n00:14:32.958 --> 00:14:35.958\nand it should know who all your friends are.\n\n00:14:35.958 --> 00:14:37.958\nSo that's what you want, is all your friends are identified,\n\n00:14:37.958 --> 00:14:39.958\nand you should just carry these relationships around.\n\n00:14:39.958 --> 00:14:42.958\nAll this data about you should just be conveyed,\n\n00:14:42.958 --> 00:14:45.958\nand you should do it once and that's all that should happen.\n\n00:14:45.958 --> 00:14:47.958\nAnd you should have all the networks\n\n00:14:47.958 --> 00:14:49.958\nof all the relationships between those pieces of data.\n\n00:14:49.958 --> 00:14:54.958\nThat's what we're moving into -- where it sort of knows these things down to that level.\n\n00:14:54.958 --> 00:14:57.958\nA semantic Web, Web 3.0, giant global graph --\n\n00:14:57.958 --> 00:15:00.958\nwe're kind of trying out what we want to call this thing.\n\n00:15:00.958 --> 00:15:02.958\nBut what's it's doing is sharing data.\n\n00:15:02.958 --> 00:15:07.958\nSo you have to be open to having your data shared, which is a much bigger step\n\n00:15:07.958 --> 00:15:09.958\nthan just sharing your Web page, or your computer.\n\n00:15:09.958 --> 00:15:13.958\nAnd all these things that are going to be on this\n\n00:15:13.958 --> 00:15:16.958\nare not just pages, they are things.\n\n00:15:16.958 --> 00:15:20.958\nEverything we've described, every artifact or place,\n\n00:15:20.958 --> 00:15:22.958\nwill be a specific representation,\n\n00:15:22.958 --> 00:15:27.958\nwill have a specific character that can be linked to directly.\n\n00:15:27.958 --> 00:15:29.958\nSo we have this database of things.\n\n00:15:29.958 --> 00:15:33.958\nAnd so there's actually a fourth thing that we have not get to,\n\n00:15:33.958 --> 00:15:35.958\nthat we won't see in the next 10 years, or 5,000 days,\n\n00:15:35.958 --> 00:15:40.958\nbut I think that's where we're going to. And as the Internet of things --\n\n00:15:40.958 --> 00:15:44.958\nwhere I'm linking directly to the particular things of my seat on the plane --\n\n00:15:44.958 --> 00:15:47.958\nthat that physical thing becomes part of the Web.\n\n00:15:47.958 --> 00:15:49.958\nAnd so we are in the middle of this thing\n\n00:15:49.958 --> 00:15:52.958\nthat's completely linked, down to every object\n\n00:15:52.958 --> 00:15:54.958\nin the little sliver of a connection that it has.\n\n00:15:54.958 --> 00:15:56.958\nSo, the last thing I want to talk about is this idea\n\n00:15:56.958 --> 00:15:59.958\nthat we're going to be codependent.\n\n00:15:59.958 --> 00:16:03.958\nIt's always going to be there, and the closer it is, the better.\n\n00:16:03.958 --> 00:16:06.958\nIf you allow Google to, it will tell you your search history.\n\n00:16:06.958 --> 00:16:08.958\nAnd I found out by looking at it\n\n00:16:08.958 --> 00:16:10.958\nthat I search most at 11 o'clock in the morning.\n\n00:16:11.958 --> 00:16:14.958\nSo I am open, and being transparent to that.\n\n00:16:14.958 --> 00:16:20.958\nAnd I think total personalization in this new world will require total transparency.\n\n00:16:20.958 --> 00:16:22.958\nThat is going to be the price.\n\n00:16:22.958 --> 00:16:23.958\nIf you want to have total personalization,\n\n00:16:23.958 --> 00:16:25.958\nyou have to be totally transparent.\n\n00:16:25.958 --> 00:16:28.958\nGoogle. I can't remember my phone number, I'll just ask Google.\n\n00:16:28.958 --> 00:16:30.958\nWe're so dependent on this that I have now gotten to the point\n\n00:16:30.958 --> 00:16:32.958\nwhere I don't even try to remember things --\n\n00:16:32.958 --> 00:16:34.958\nI'll just Google it. It's easier to do that.\n\n00:16:34.958 --> 00:16:37.958\nAnd we kind of object at first, saying, \"Oh, that's awful.\"\n\n00:16:37.958 --> 00:16:40.958\nBut if we think about the dependency that we have on this other technology,\n\n00:16:40.958 --> 00:16:42.958\ncalled the alphabet, and writing,\n\n00:16:42.958 --> 00:16:45.958\nwe're totally dependent on it, and it's transformed culture.\n\n00:16:45.958 --> 00:16:49.958\nWe cannot imagine ourselves without the alphabet and writing.\n\n00:16:49.958 --> 00:16:52.958\nAnd so in the same way, we're going to not imagine ourselves\n\n00:16:52.958 --> 00:16:54.958\nwithout this other machine being there.\n\n00:16:54.958 --> 00:16:57.958\nAnd what is happening with this is\n\n00:16:57.958 --> 00:16:59.958\nsome kind of AI, but it's not the AI in conscious AI,\n\n00:16:59.958 --> 00:17:02.958\nas being an expert, Larry Page told me\n\n00:17:02.958 --> 00:17:03.958\nthat that's what they're trying to do,\n\n00:17:03.958 --> 00:17:05.958\nand that's what they're trying to do.\n\n00:17:05.958 --> 00:17:08.958\nBut when six billion humans are Googling,\n\n00:17:08.958 --> 00:17:10.958\nwho's searching who? It goes both ways.\n\n00:17:10.958 --> 00:17:14.958\nSo we are the Web, that's what this thing is.\n\n00:17:14.958 --> 00:17:16.958\nWe are going to be the machine.\n\n00:17:16.958 --> 00:17:21.958\nSo the next 5,000 days, it's not going to be the Web and only better.\n\n00:17:21.958 --> 00:17:23.958\nJust like it wasn't TV and only better.\n\n00:17:23.958 --> 00:17:26.958\nThe next 5,000 days, it's not just going to be the Web\n\n00:17:26.958 --> 00:17:28.958\nbut only better -- it's going to be something different.\n\n00:17:28.958 --> 00:17:32.958\nAnd I think it's going to be smarter.\n\n00:17:32.958 --> 00:17:36.958\nIt'll have an intelligence in there, that's not, again, conscious.\n\n00:17:36.958 --> 00:17:40.958\nBut it'll anticipate what we're doing, in a good sense.\n\n00:17:40.958 --> 00:17:43.958\nSecondly, it's become much more personalized.\n\n00:17:43.958 --> 00:17:45.958\nIt will know us, and that's good.\n\n00:17:45.958 --> 00:17:49.958\nAnd again, the price of that will be transparency.\n\n00:17:49.958 --> 00:17:51.958\nAnd thirdly, it's going to become more ubiquitous\n\n00:17:51.958 --> 00:17:56.958\nin terms of filling your entire environment, and we will be in the middle of it.\n\n00:17:56.958 --> 00:17:59.958\nAnd all these devices will be portals into that.\n\n00:17:59.958 --> 00:18:02.958\nSo the single idea that I wanted to leave with you\n\n00:18:02.958 --> 00:18:08.958\nis that we have to begin to think about this as not just \"the Web, only better,\"\n\n00:18:08.958 --> 00:18:11.958\nbut a new kind of stage in this development.\n\n00:18:11.958 --> 00:18:14.958\nIt looks more global. If you take this whole thing,\n\n00:18:14.958 --> 00:18:17.958\nit is a very big machine, very reliable machine,\n\n00:18:17.958 --> 00:18:19.958\nmore reliable than its parts.\n\n00:18:19.958 --> 00:18:22.958\nBut we can also think about it as kind of a large organism.\n\n00:18:22.958 --> 00:18:27.958\nSo we might respond to it more as if this was a whole system,\n\n00:18:27.958 --> 00:18:29.958\nmore as if this wasn't a large organism\n\n00:18:29.958 --> 00:18:33.958\nthat we are going to be interacting with. It's a \"One.\"\n\n00:18:33.958 --> 00:18:36.958\nAnd I don't know what else to call it, than the One.\n\n00:18:36.958 --> 00:18:37.958\nWe'll have a better word for it.\n\n00:18:37.958 --> 00:18:40.958\nBut there's a unity of some sort that's starting to emerge.\n\n00:18:40.958 --> 00:18:43.958\nAnd again, I don't want to talk about consciousness,\n\n00:18:43.958 --> 00:18:45.958\nI want to talk about it just as if it was a little bacteria,\n\n00:18:45.958 --> 00:18:48.958\nor a volvox, which is what that organism is.\n\n00:18:48.958 --> 00:18:54.958\nSo, to do, action, take-away. So, here's what I would say:\n\n00:18:54.958 --> 00:18:58.958\nthere's only one machine, and the Web is its OS.\n\n00:18:58.958 --> 00:19:02.958\nAll screens look into the One. No bits will live outside the Web.\n\n00:19:02.958 --> 00:19:06.958\nTo share is to gain. Let the One read it.\n\n00:19:06.958 --> 00:19:07.958\nIt's going to be machine-readable.\n\n00:19:07.958 --> 00:19:10.958\nYou want to make something that the machine can read.\n\n00:19:10.958 --> 00:19:15.958\nAnd the One is us. We are in the One.\n\n00:19:15.958 --> 00:19:17.958\nI appreciate your time.\n\n00:19:17.958 --> 00:19:20.958\n(Applause)"}, {"title": "A computer that works like the brain", "duration": "982", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/kwabena_boahen_on_a_computer_that_works_like_the_brain", "transcript": "I got my first computer when I was a teenager growing up in Accra, and it was a really cool device. You could play games with it. You could program it in BASIC. And I was fascinated. So I went into the library to figure out how did this thing work. I read about how the CPU is constantly shuffling data back and forth between the memory, the RAM and the ALU, the arithmetic and logic unit. And I thought to myself, this CPU really has to work like crazy just to keep all this data moving through the system.But nobody was really worried about this. When computers were first introduced, they were said to be a million times faster than neurons. People were really excited. They thought they would soon outstrip the capacity of the brain. This is a quote, actually, from Alan Turing: \"In 30 years, it will be as easy to ask a computer a question as to ask a person.\" This was in 1946. And now, in 2007, it's still not true. And so, the question is, why aren't we really seeing this kind of power in computers that we see in the brain?What people didn't realize, and I'm just beginning to realize right now, is that we pay a huge price for the speed that we claim is a big advantage of these computers. Let's take a look at some numbers. This is Blue Gene, the fastest computer in the world. It's got 120,000 processors; they can basically process 10 quadrillion bits of information per second. That's 10 to the sixteenth. And they consume one and a half megawatts of power. So that would be really great, if you could add that to the production capacity in Tanzania. It would really boost the economy. Just to go back to the States, if you translate the amount of power or electricity this computer uses to the amount of households in the States, you get 1,200 households in the U.S. That's how much power this computer uses.Now, let's compare this with the brain. This is a picture of, actually Rory Sayres' girlfriend's brain. Rory is a graduate student at Stanford. He studies the brain using MRI, and he claims that this is the most beautiful brain that he has ever scanned. (Laughter) So that's true love, right there. Now, how much computation does the brain do? I estimate 10 to the 16 bits per second, which is actually about very similar to what Blue Gene does. So that's the question. The question is, how much \u2014 they are doing a similar amount of processing, similar amount of data \u2014 the question is how much energy or electricity does the brain use? And it's actually as much as your laptop computer: it's just 10 watts. So what we are doing right now with computers with the energy consumed by 1,200 houses, the brain is doing with the energy consumed by your laptop.So the question is, how is the brain able to achieve this kind of efficiency? And let me just summarize. So the bottom line: the brain processes information using 100,000 times less energy than we do right now with this computer technology that we have. How is the brain able to do this? Let's just take a look about how the brain works, and then I'll compare that with how computers work. So, this clip is from the PBS series, \"The Secret Life of the Brain.\" It shows you these cells that process information. They are called neurons. They send little pulses of electricity down their processes to each other, and where they contact each other, those little pulses of electricity can jump from one neuron to the other. That process is called a synapse. You've got this huge network of cells interacting with each other \u2014 about 100 million of them, sending about 10 quadrillion of these pulses around every second. And that's basically what's going on in your brain right now as you're watching this.How does that compare with the way computers work? In the computer, you have all the data going through the central processing unit, and any piece of data basically has to go through that bottleneck, whereas in the brain, what you have is these neurons, and the data just really flows through a network of connections among the neurons. There's no bottleneck here. It's really a network in the literal sense of the word. The net is doing the work in the brain. If you just look at these two pictures, these kind of words pop into your mind. This is serial and it's rigid \u2014 it's like cars on a freeway, everything has to happen in lockstep \u2014 whereas this is parallel and it's fluid. Information processing is very dynamic and adaptive.So I'm not the first to figure this out. This is a quote from Brian Eno: \"the problem with computers is that there is not enough Africa in them.\" (Laughter) Brian actually said this in 1995. And nobody was listening then, but now people are beginning to listen because there's a pressing, technological problem that we face. And I'll just take you through that a little bit in the next few slides.This is \u2014 it's actually really this remarkable convergence between the devices that we use to compute in computers, and the devices that our brains use to compute. The devices that computers use are what's called a transistor. This electrode here, called the gate, controls the flow of current from the source to the drain \u2014 these two electrodes. And that current, electrical current, is carried by electrons, just like in your house and so on. And what you have here is, when you actually turn on the gate, you get an increase in the amount of current, and you get a steady flow of current. And when you turn off the gate, there's no current flowing through the device. Your computer uses this presence of current to represent a one, and the absence of current to represent a zero.Now, what's happening is that as transistors are getting smaller and smaller and smaller, they no longer behave like this. In fact, they are starting to behave like the device that neurons use to compute, which is called an ion channel. And this is a little protein molecule. I mean, neurons have thousands of these. And it sits in the membrane of the cell and it's got a pore in it. And these are individual potassium ions that are flowing through that pore. Now, this pore can open and close. But, when it's open, because these ions have to line up and flow through, one at a time, you get a kind of sporadic, not steady \u2014 it's a sporadic flow of current. And even when you close the pore \u2014 which neurons can do, they can open and close these pores to generate electrical activity \u2014 even when it's closed, because these ions are so small, they can actually sneak through, a few can sneak through at a time. So, what you have is that when the pore is open, you get some current sometimes. These are your ones, but you've got a few zeros thrown in. And when it's closed, you have a zero, but you have a few ones thrown in.Now, this is starting to happen in transistors. And the reason why that's happening is that, right now, in 2007 \u2014 the technology that we are using \u2014 a transistor is big enough that several electrons can flow through the channel simultaneously, side by side. In fact, there's about 12 electrons can all be flowing this way. And that means that a transistor corresponds to about 12 ion channels in parallel. Now, in a few years time, by 2015, we will shrink transistors so much. This is what Intel does to keep adding more cores onto the chip. Or your memory sticks that you have now can carry one gigabyte of stuff on them \u2014 before, it was 256. Transistors are getting smaller to allow this to happen, and technology has really benefitted from that.But what's happening now is that in 2015, the transistor is going to become so small, that it corresponds to only one electron at a time can flow through that channel, and that corresponds to a single ion channel. And you start having the same kind of traffic jams that you have in the ion channel. The current will turn on and off at random, even when it's supposed to be on. And that means your computer is going to get its ones and zeros mixed up, and that's going to crash your machine.So, we are at the stage where we don't really know how to compute with these kinds of devices. And the only kind of thing \u2014 the only thing we know right now that can compute with these kinds of devices are the brain.OK, so a computer picks a specific item of data from memory, it sends it into the processor or the ALU, and then it puts the result back into memory. That's the red path that's highlighted. The way brains work, I told you all, you have got all these neurons. And the way they represent information is they break up that data into little pieces that are represented by pulses and different neurons. So you have all these pieces of data distributed throughout the network. And then the way that you process that data to get a result is that you translate this pattern of activity into a new pattern of activity, just by it flowing through the network. So you set up these connections such that the input pattern just flows and generates the output pattern.What you see here is that there's these redundant connections. So if this piece of data or this piece of the data gets clobbered, it doesn't show up over here, these two pieces can activate the missing part with these redundant connections. So even when you go to these crappy devices where sometimes you want a one and you get a zero, and it doesn't show up, there's redundancy in the network that can actually recover the missing information. It makes the brain inherently robust. What you have here is a system where you store data locally. And it's brittle, because each of these steps has to be flawless, otherwise you lose that data, whereas in the brain, you have a system that stores data in a distributed way, and it's robust.What I want to basically talk about is my dream, which is to build a computer that works like the brain. This is something that we've been working on for the last couple of years. And I'm going to show you a system that we designed to model the retina, which is a piece of brain that lines the inside of your eyeball. We didn't do this by actually writing code, like you do in a computer. In fact, the processing that happens in that little piece of brain is very similar to the kind of processing that computers do when they stream video over the Internet. They want to compress the information \u2014 they just want to send the changes, what's new in the image, and so on \u2014 and that is how your eyeball is able to squeeze all that information down to your optic nerve, to send to the rest of the brain.Instead of doing this in software, or doing those kinds of algorithms, we went and talked to neurobiologists who have actually reverse engineered that piece of brain that's called the retina. And they figured out all the different cells, and they figured out the network, and we just took that network and we used it as the blueprint for the design of a silicon chip. So now the neurons are represented by little nodes or circuits on the chip, and the connections among the neurons are represented, actually modeled by transistors. And these transistors are behaving essentially just like ion channels behave in the brain. It will give you the same kind of robust architecture that I described.Here is actually what our artificial eye looks like. The retina chip that we designed sits behind this lens here. And the chip \u2014 I'm going to show you a video that the silicon retina put out of its output when it was looking at Kareem Zaghloul, who's the student who designed this chip. Let me explain what you're going to see, OK, because it's putting out different kinds of information, it's not as straightforward as a camera. The retina chip extracts four different kinds of information. It extracts regions with dark contrast, which will show up on the video as red. And it extracts regions with white or light contrast, which will show up on the video as green.This is Kareem's dark eyes and that's the white background that you see here. And then it also extracts movement. When Kareem moves his head to the right, you will see this blue activity there; it represents regions where the contrast is increasing in the image, that's where it's going from dark to light. And you also see this yellow activity, which represents regions where contrast is decreasing; it's going from light to dark. And these four types of information \u2014 your optic nerve has about a million fibers in it, and 900,000 of those fibers send these four types of information. So we are really duplicating the kind of signals that you have on the optic nerve.What you notice here is that these snapshots taken from the output of the retina chip are very sparse, right? It doesn't light up green everywhere in the background, only on the edges, and then in the hair, and so on. And this is the same thing you see when people compress video to send: they want to make it very sparse, because that file is smaller. And this is what the retina is doing, and it's doing it just with the circuitry, and how this network of neurons that are interacting in there, which we've captured on the chip.But the point that I want to make \u2014 I'll show you up here. So this image here is going to look like these ones, but here I'll show you that we can reconstruct the image, so, you know, you can almost recognize Kareem in that top part there. And so, here you go. Yes, so that's the idea. When you stand still, you just see the light and dark contrasts. But when it's moving back and forth, the retina picks up these changes. And that's why, you know, when you're sitting here and something happens in your background, you merely move your eyes to it. There are these cells that detect change and you move your attention to it. So those are very important for catching somebody who's trying to sneak up on you.Let me just end by saying that this is what happens when you put Africa in a piano, OK. This is a steel drum here that has been modified, and that's what happens when you put Africa in a piano. And what I would like us to do is put Africa in the computer, and come up with a new kind of computer that will generate thought, imagination, be creative and things like that. Thank you. (Applause)Chris Anderson: Question for you, Kwabena. Do you put together in your mind the work you're doing, the future of Africa, this conference \u2014 what connections can we make, if any, between them?Kwabena Boahen: Yes, like I said at the beginning, I got my first computer when I was a teenager, growing up in Accra. And I had this gut reaction that this was the wrong way to do it. It was very brute force; it was very inelegant. I don't think that I would've had that reaction, if I'd grown up reading all this science fiction, hearing about RD2D2, whatever it was called, and just \u2014 you know, buying into this hype about computers. I was coming at it from a different perspective, where I was bringing that different perspective to bear on the problem. And I think a lot of people in Africa have this different perspective, and I think that's going to impact technology. And that's going to impact how it's going to evolve. And I think you're going to be able to see, use that infusion, to come up with new things, because you're coming from a different perspective. I think we can contribute. We can dream like everybody else.CA: Thanks Kwabena, that was really interesting. Thank you.(Applause)", "id": 320, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:11.958 --> 00:00:16.958\nI got my first computer when I was a teenager growing up in Accra,\n\n00:00:16.958 --> 00:00:19.958\nand it was a really cool device.\n\n00:00:19.958 --> 00:00:24.958\nYou could play games with it. You could program it in BASIC.\n\n00:00:24.958 --> 00:00:26.958\nAnd I was fascinated.\n\n00:00:26.958 --> 00:00:32.958\nSo I went into the library to figure out how did this thing work.\n\n00:00:32.958 --> 00:00:37.958\nI read about how the CPU is constantly shuffling data back and forth\n\n00:00:37.958 --> 00:00:41.958\nbetween the memory, the RAM and the ALU,\n\n00:00:41.958 --> 00:00:43.958\nthe arithmetic and logic unit.\n\n00:00:43.958 --> 00:00:47.958\nAnd I thought to myself, this CPU really has to work like crazy\n\n00:00:47.958 --> 00:00:51.958\njust to keep all this data moving through the system.\n\n00:00:51.958 --> 00:00:54.958\nBut nobody was really worried about this.\n\n00:00:54.958 --> 00:00:56.958\nWhen computers were first introduced,\n\n00:00:56.958 --> 00:00:59.958\nthey were said to be a million times faster than neurons.\n\n00:00:59.958 --> 00:01:04.958\nPeople were really excited. They thought they would soon outstrip\n\n00:01:04.958 --> 00:01:07.958\nthe capacity of the brain.\n\n00:01:07.958 --> 00:01:10.958\nThis is a quote, actually, from Alan Turing:\n\n00:01:10.958 --> 00:01:14.958\n\"In 30 years, it will be as easy to ask a computer a question\n\n00:01:14.958 --> 00:01:16.958\nas to ask a person.\"\n\n00:01:16.958 --> 00:01:23.958\nThis was in 1946. And now, in 2007, it's still not true.\n\n00:01:23.958 --> 00:01:27.958\nAnd so, the question is, why aren't we really seeing\n\n00:01:27.958 --> 00:01:31.958\nthis kind of power in computers that we see in the brain?\n\n00:01:31.958 --> 00:01:35.958\nWhat people didn't realize, and I'm just beginning to realize right now,\n\n00:01:35.958 --> 00:01:37.958\nis that we pay a huge price for the speed\n\n00:01:37.958 --> 00:01:41.958\nthat we claim is a big advantage of these computers.\n\n00:01:41.958 --> 00:01:43.958\nLet's take a look at some numbers.\n\n00:01:43.958 --> 00:01:47.958\nThis is Blue Gene, the fastest computer in the world.\n\n00:01:47.958 --> 00:01:52.958\nIt's got 120,000 processors; they can basically process\n\n00:01:52.958 --> 00:01:55.958\n10 quadrillion bits of information per second.\n\n00:01:55.958 --> 00:02:02.958\nThat's 10 to the sixteenth. And they consume one and a half megawatts of power.\n\n00:02:02.958 --> 00:02:05.958\nSo that would be really great, if you could add that\n\n00:02:05.958 --> 00:02:07.958\nto the production capacity in Tanzania.\n\n00:02:07.958 --> 00:02:09.958\nIt would really boost the economy.\n\n00:02:09.958 --> 00:02:13.958\nJust to go back to the States,\n\n00:02:13.958 --> 00:02:15.958\nif you translate the amount of power or electricity\n\n00:02:15.958 --> 00:02:18.958\nthis computer uses to the amount of households in the States,\n\n00:02:18.958 --> 00:02:22.958\nyou get 1,200 households in the U.S.\n\n00:02:22.958 --> 00:02:24.958\nThat's how much power this computer uses.\n\n00:02:24.958 --> 00:02:27.958\nNow, let's compare this with the brain.\n\n00:02:27.958 --> 00:02:32.958\nThis is a picture of, actually Rory Sayres' girlfriend's brain.\n\n00:02:32.958 --> 00:02:34.958\nRory is a graduate student at Stanford.\n\n00:02:34.958 --> 00:02:38.958\nHe studies the brain using MRI, and he claims that\n\n00:02:38.958 --> 00:02:41.958\nthis is the most beautiful brain that he has ever scanned.\n\n00:02:41.958 --> 00:02:43.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:02:43.958 --> 00:02:46.958\nSo that's true love, right there.\n\n00:02:46.958 --> 00:02:49.958\nNow, how much computation does the brain do?\n\n00:02:49.958 --> 00:02:51.958\nI estimate 10 to the 16 bits per second,\n\n00:02:51.958 --> 00:02:55.958\nwhich is actually about very similar to what Blue Gene does.\n\n00:02:55.958 --> 00:02:57.958\nSo that's the question. The question is, how much --\n\n00:02:57.958 --> 00:03:00.958\nthey are doing a similar amount of processing, similar amount of data --\n\n00:03:00.958 --> 00:03:05.958\nthe question is how much energy or electricity does the brain use?\n\n00:03:05.958 --> 00:03:08.958\nAnd it's actually as much as your laptop computer:\n\n00:03:08.958 --> 00:03:10.958\nit's just 10 watts.\n\n00:03:10.958 --> 00:03:13.958\nSo what we are doing right now with computers\n\n00:03:13.958 --> 00:03:16.958\nwith the energy consumed by 1,200 houses,\n\n00:03:16.958 --> 00:03:21.958\nthe brain is doing with the energy consumed by your laptop.\n\n00:03:21.958 --> 00:03:24.958\nSo the question is, how is the brain able to achieve this kind of efficiency?\n\n00:03:24.958 --> 00:03:26.958\nAnd let me just summarize. So the bottom line:\n\n00:03:26.958 --> 00:03:30.958\nthe brain processes information using 100,000 times less energy\n\n00:03:30.958 --> 00:03:34.958\nthan we do right now with this computer technology that we have.\n\n00:03:34.958 --> 00:03:36.958\nHow is the brain able to do this?\n\n00:03:36.958 --> 00:03:39.958\nLet's just take a look about how the brain works,\n\n00:03:39.958 --> 00:03:43.958\nand then I'll compare that with how computers work.\n\n00:03:43.958 --> 00:03:47.958\nSo, this clip is from the PBS series, \"The Secret Life of the Brain.\"\n\n00:03:47.958 --> 00:03:50.958\nIt shows you these cells that process information.\n\n00:03:50.958 --> 00:03:51.958\nThey are called neurons.\n\n00:03:51.958 --> 00:03:57.958\nThey send little pulses of electricity down their processes to each other,\n\n00:03:57.958 --> 00:03:59.958\nand where they contact each other, those little pulses\n\n00:03:59.958 --> 00:04:01.958\nof electricity can jump from one neuron to the other.\n\n00:04:01.958 --> 00:04:04.958\nThat process is called a synapse.\n\n00:04:04.958 --> 00:04:06.958\nYou've got this huge network of cells interacting with each other --\n\n00:04:06.958 --> 00:04:08.958\nabout 100 million of them,\n\n00:04:08.958 --> 00:04:12.958\nsending about 10 quadrillion of these pulses around every second.\n\n00:04:12.958 --> 00:04:18.958\nAnd that's basically what's going on in your brain right now as you're watching this.\n\n00:04:18.958 --> 00:04:20.958\nHow does that compare with the way computers work?\n\n00:04:20.958 --> 00:04:22.958\nIn the computer, you have all the data\n\n00:04:22.958 --> 00:04:24.958\ngoing through the central processing unit,\n\n00:04:24.958 --> 00:04:27.958\nand any piece of data basically has to go through that bottleneck,\n\n00:04:27.958 --> 00:04:31.958\nwhereas in the brain, what you have is these neurons,\n\n00:04:31.958 --> 00:04:35.958\nand the data just really flows through a network of connections\n\n00:04:35.958 --> 00:04:37.958\namong the neurons. There's no bottleneck here.\n\n00:04:37.958 --> 00:04:41.958\nIt's really a network in the literal sense of the word.\n\n00:04:41.958 --> 00:04:45.958\nThe net is doing the work in the brain.\n\n00:04:45.958 --> 00:04:47.958\nIf you just look at these two pictures,\n\n00:04:47.958 --> 00:04:49.958\nthese kind of words pop into your mind.\n\n00:04:49.958 --> 00:04:53.958\nThis is serial and it's rigid -- it's like cars on a freeway,\n\n00:04:53.958 --> 00:04:56.958\neverything has to happen in lockstep --\n\n00:04:56.958 --> 00:04:58.958\nwhereas this is parallel and it's fluid.\n\n00:04:58.958 --> 00:05:01.958\nInformation processing is very dynamic and adaptive.\n\n00:05:01.958 --> 00:05:05.958\nSo I'm not the first to figure this out. This is a quote from Brian Eno:\n\n00:05:05.958 --> 00:05:09.958\n\"the problem with computers is that there is not enough Africa in them.\"\n\n00:05:09.958 --> 00:05:15.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:05:15.958 --> 00:05:18.958\nBrian actually said this in 1995.\n\n00:05:18.958 --> 00:05:21.958\nAnd nobody was listening then,\n\n00:05:21.958 --> 00:05:23.958\nbut now people are beginning to listen\n\n00:05:23.958 --> 00:05:28.958\nbecause there's a pressing, technological problem that we face.\n\n00:05:28.958 --> 00:05:33.958\nAnd I'll just take you through that a little bit in the next few slides.\n\n00:05:33.958 --> 00:05:37.958\nThis is -- it's actually really this remarkable convergence\n\n00:05:37.958 --> 00:05:42.958\nbetween the devices that we use to compute in computers,\n\n00:05:42.958 --> 00:05:46.958\nand the devices that our brains use to compute.\n\n00:05:46.958 --> 00:05:50.958\nThe devices that computers use are what's called a transistor.\n\n00:05:50.958 --> 00:05:54.958\nThis electrode here, called the gate, controls the flow of current\n\n00:05:54.958 --> 00:05:57.958\nfrom the source to the drain -- these two electrodes.\n\n00:05:57.958 --> 00:05:59.958\nAnd that current, electrical current,\n\n00:05:59.958 --> 00:06:05.958\nis carried by electrons, just like in your house and so on.\n\n00:06:05.958 --> 00:06:10.958\nAnd what you have here is, when you actually turn on the gate,\n\n00:06:10.958 --> 00:06:14.958\nyou get an increase in the amount of current, and you get a steady flow of current.\n\n00:06:14.958 --> 00:06:18.958\nAnd when you turn off the gate, there's no current flowing through the device.\n\n00:06:18.958 --> 00:06:23.958\nYour computer uses this presence of current to represent a one,\n\n00:06:23.958 --> 00:06:27.958\nand the absence of current to represent a zero.\n\n00:06:27.958 --> 00:06:33.958\nNow, what's happening is that as transistors are getting smaller and smaller and smaller,\n\n00:06:33.958 --> 00:06:35.958\nthey no longer behave like this.\n\n00:06:35.958 --> 00:06:40.958\nIn fact, they are starting to behave like the device that neurons use to compute,\n\n00:06:40.958 --> 00:06:42.958\nwhich is called an ion channel.\n\n00:06:42.958 --> 00:06:44.958\nAnd this is a little protein molecule.\n\n00:06:44.958 --> 00:06:48.958\nI mean, neurons have thousands of these.\n\n00:06:48.958 --> 00:06:52.958\nAnd it sits in the membrane of the cell and it's got a pore in it.\n\n00:06:52.958 --> 00:06:55.958\nAnd these are individual potassium ions\n\n00:06:55.958 --> 00:06:57.958\nthat are flowing through that pore.\n\n00:06:57.958 --> 00:06:59.958\nNow, this pore can open and close.\n\n00:06:59.958 --> 00:07:04.958\nBut, when it's open, because these ions have to line up\n\n00:07:04.958 --> 00:07:09.958\nand flow through, one at a time, you get a kind of sporadic, not steady --\n\n00:07:09.958 --> 00:07:12.958\nit's a sporadic flow of current.\n\n00:07:12.958 --> 00:07:15.958\nAnd even when you close the pore -- which neurons can do,\n\n00:07:15.958 --> 00:07:20.958\nthey can open and close these pores to generate electrical activity --\n\n00:07:20.958 --> 00:07:23.958\neven when it's closed, because these ions are so small,\n\n00:07:23.958 --> 00:07:26.958\nthey can actually sneak through, a few can sneak through at a time.\n\n00:07:26.958 --> 00:07:29.958\nSo, what you have is that when the pore is open,\n\n00:07:29.958 --> 00:07:31.958\nyou get some current sometimes.\n\n00:07:31.958 --> 00:07:34.958\nThese are your ones, but you've got a few zeros thrown in.\n\n00:07:34.958 --> 00:07:38.958\nAnd when it's closed, you have a zero,\n\n00:07:38.958 --> 00:07:41.958\nbut you have a few ones thrown in.\n\n00:07:41.958 --> 00:07:44.958\nNow, this is starting to happen in transistors.\n\n00:07:44.958 --> 00:07:49.958\nAnd the reason why that's happening is that, right now, in 2007 --\n\n00:07:49.958 --> 00:07:53.958\nthe technology that we are using -- a transistor is big enough\n\n00:07:53.958 --> 00:07:58.958\nthat several electrons can flow through the channel simultaneously, side by side.\n\n00:07:58.958 --> 00:08:02.958\nIn fact, there's about 12 electrons can all be flowing this way.\n\n00:08:02.958 --> 00:08:04.958\nAnd that means that a transistor corresponds\n\n00:08:04.958 --> 00:08:07.958\nto about 12 ion channels in parallel.\n\n00:08:07.958 --> 00:08:12.958\nNow, in a few years time, by 2015, we will shrink transistors so much.\n\n00:08:12.958 --> 00:08:17.958\nThis is what Intel does to keep adding more cores onto the chip.\n\n00:08:17.958 --> 00:08:20.958\nOr your memory sticks that you have now can carry one gigabyte\n\n00:08:20.958 --> 00:08:22.958\nof stuff on them -- before, it was 256.\n\n00:08:22.958 --> 00:08:25.958\nTransistors are getting smaller to allow this to happen,\n\n00:08:25.958 --> 00:08:28.958\nand technology has really benefitted from that.\n\n00:08:28.958 --> 00:08:33.958\nBut what's happening now is that in 2015, the transistor is going to become so small,\n\n00:08:33.958 --> 00:08:36.958\nthat it corresponds to only one electron at a time\n\n00:08:36.958 --> 00:08:38.958\ncan flow through that channel,\n\n00:08:38.958 --> 00:08:40.958\nand that corresponds to a single ion channel.\n\n00:08:40.958 --> 00:08:44.958\nAnd you start having the same kind of traffic jams that you have in the ion channel.\n\n00:08:44.958 --> 00:08:47.958\nThe current will turn on and off at random,\n\n00:08:47.958 --> 00:08:49.958\neven when it's supposed to be on.\n\n00:08:49.958 --> 00:08:51.958\nAnd that means your computer is going to get\n\n00:08:51.958 --> 00:08:55.958\nits ones and zeros mixed up, and that's going to crash your machine.\n\n00:08:55.958 --> 00:08:59.958\nSo, we are at the stage where we\n\n00:08:59.958 --> 00:09:02.958\ndon't really know how to compute with these kinds of devices.\n\n00:09:02.958 --> 00:09:05.958\nAnd the only kind of thing -- the only thing we know right now\n\n00:09:05.958 --> 00:09:08.958\nthat can compute with these kinds of devices are the brain.\n\n00:09:08.958 --> 00:09:12.958\nOK, so a computer picks a specific item of data from memory,\n\n00:09:12.958 --> 00:09:15.958\nit sends it into the processor or the ALU,\n\n00:09:15.958 --> 00:09:17.958\nand then it puts the result back into memory.\n\n00:09:17.958 --> 00:09:19.958\nThat's the red path that's highlighted.\n\n00:09:19.958 --> 00:09:23.958\nThe way brains work, I told you all, you have got all these neurons.\n\n00:09:23.958 --> 00:09:25.958\nAnd the way they represent information is\n\n00:09:25.958 --> 00:09:27.958\nthey break up that data into little pieces\n\n00:09:27.958 --> 00:09:30.958\nthat are represented by pulses and different neurons.\n\n00:09:30.958 --> 00:09:32.958\nSo you have all these pieces of data\n\n00:09:32.958 --> 00:09:34.958\ndistributed throughout the network.\n\n00:09:34.958 --> 00:09:37.958\nAnd then the way that you process that data to get a result\n\n00:09:37.958 --> 00:09:41.958\nis that you translate this pattern of activity into a new pattern of activity,\n\n00:09:41.958 --> 00:09:44.958\njust by it flowing through the network.\n\n00:09:44.958 --> 00:09:46.958\nSo you set up these connections\n\n00:09:46.958 --> 00:09:49.958\nsuch that the input pattern just flows\n\n00:09:49.958 --> 00:09:51.958\nand generates the output pattern.\n\n00:09:51.958 --> 00:09:55.958\nWhat you see here is that there's these redundant connections.\n\n00:09:55.958 --> 00:09:59.958\nSo if this piece of data or this piece of the data gets clobbered,\n\n00:09:59.958 --> 00:10:04.958\nit doesn't show up over here, these two pieces can activate the missing part\n\n00:10:04.958 --> 00:10:06.958\nwith these redundant connections.\n\n00:10:06.958 --> 00:10:08.958\nSo even when you go to these crappy devices\n\n00:10:08.958 --> 00:10:11.958\nwhere sometimes you want a one and you get a zero, and it doesn't show up,\n\n00:10:11.958 --> 00:10:13.958\nthere's redundancy in the network\n\n00:10:13.958 --> 00:10:16.958\nthat can actually recover the missing information.\n\n00:10:16.958 --> 00:10:19.958\nIt makes the brain inherently robust.\n\n00:10:19.958 --> 00:10:22.958\nWhat you have here is a system where you store data locally.\n\n00:10:22.958 --> 00:10:26.958\nAnd it's brittle, because each of these steps has to be flawless,\n\n00:10:26.958 --> 00:10:29.958\notherwise you lose that data, whereas in the brain, you have a system\n\n00:10:29.958 --> 00:10:33.958\nthat stores data in a distributed way, and it's robust.\n\n00:10:33.958 --> 00:10:37.958\nWhat I want to basically talk about is my dream,\n\n00:10:37.958 --> 00:10:40.958\nwhich is to build a computer that works like the brain.\n\n00:10:40.958 --> 00:10:44.958\nThis is something that we've been working on for the last couple of years.\n\n00:10:44.958 --> 00:10:47.958\nAnd I'm going to show you a system that we designed\n\n00:10:47.958 --> 00:10:50.958\nto model the retina,\n\n00:10:50.958 --> 00:10:55.958\nwhich is a piece of brain that lines the inside of your eyeball.\n\n00:10:55.958 --> 00:11:01.958\nWe didn't do this by actually writing code, like you do in a computer.\n\n00:11:01.958 --> 00:11:04.958\nIn fact, the processing that happens\n\n00:11:04.958 --> 00:11:06.958\nin that little piece of brain is very similar\n\n00:11:06.958 --> 00:11:07.958\nto the kind of processing that computers\n\n00:11:07.958 --> 00:11:11.958\ndo when they stream video over the Internet.\n\n00:11:11.958 --> 00:11:12.958\nThey want to compress the information --\n\n00:11:12.958 --> 00:11:16.958\nthey just want to send the changes, what's new in the image, and so on --\n\n00:11:16.958 --> 00:11:19.958\nand that is how your eyeball\n\n00:11:19.958 --> 00:11:22.958\nis able to squeeze all that information down to your optic nerve,\n\n00:11:22.958 --> 00:11:24.958\nto send to the rest of the brain.\n\n00:11:24.958 --> 00:11:27.958\nInstead of doing this in software, or doing those kinds of algorithms,\n\n00:11:27.958 --> 00:11:30.958\nwe went and talked to neurobiologists\n\n00:11:30.958 --> 00:11:34.958\nwho have actually reverse engineered that piece of brain that's called the retina.\n\n00:11:34.958 --> 00:11:36.958\nAnd they figured out all the different cells,\n\n00:11:36.958 --> 00:11:39.958\nand they figured out the network, and we just took that network\n\n00:11:39.958 --> 00:11:43.958\nand we used it as the blueprint for the design of a silicon chip.\n\n00:11:43.958 --> 00:11:49.958\nSo now the neurons are represented by little nodes or circuits on the chip,\n\n00:11:49.958 --> 00:11:54.958\nand the connections among the neurons are represented, actually modeled by transistors.\n\n00:11:54.958 --> 00:11:56.958\nAnd these transistors are behaving essentially\n\n00:11:56.958 --> 00:11:59.958\njust like ion channels behave in the brain.\n\n00:11:59.958 --> 00:12:04.958\nIt will give you the same kind of robust architecture that I described.\n\n00:12:04.958 --> 00:12:08.958\nHere is actually what our artificial eye looks like.\n\n00:12:08.958 --> 00:12:13.958\nThe retina chip that we designed sits behind this lens here.\n\n00:12:13.958 --> 00:12:15.958\nAnd the chip -- I'm going to show you a video\n\n00:12:15.958 --> 00:12:18.958\nthat the silicon retina put out of its output\n\n00:12:18.958 --> 00:12:21.958\nwhen it was looking at Kareem Zaghloul,\n\n00:12:21.958 --> 00:12:23.958\nwho's the student who designed this chip.\n\n00:12:23.958 --> 00:12:25.958\nLet me explain what you're going to see, OK,\n\n00:12:25.958 --> 00:12:28.958\nbecause it's putting out different kinds of information,\n\n00:12:28.958 --> 00:12:30.958\nit's not as straightforward as a camera.\n\n00:12:30.958 --> 00:12:33.958\nThe retina chip extracts four different kinds of information.\n\n00:12:33.958 --> 00:12:36.958\nIt extracts regions with dark contrast,\n\n00:12:36.958 --> 00:12:39.958\nwhich will show up on the video as red.\n\n00:12:39.958 --> 00:12:43.958\nAnd it extracts regions with white or light contrast,\n\n00:12:43.958 --> 00:12:45.958\nwhich will show up on the video as green.\n\n00:12:45.958 --> 00:12:47.958\nThis is Kareem's dark eyes\n\n00:12:47.958 --> 00:12:50.958\nand that's the white background that you see here.\n\n00:12:50.958 --> 00:12:52.958\nAnd then it also extracts movement.\n\n00:12:52.958 --> 00:12:54.958\nWhen Kareem moves his head to the right,\n\n00:12:54.958 --> 00:12:56.958\nyou will see this blue activity there;\n\n00:12:56.958 --> 00:12:59.958\nit represents regions where the contrast is increasing in the image,\n\n00:12:59.958 --> 00:13:02.958\nthat's where it's going from dark to light.\n\n00:13:02.958 --> 00:13:04.958\nAnd you also see this yellow activity,\n\n00:13:04.958 --> 00:13:08.958\nwhich represents regions where contrast is decreasing;\n\n00:13:08.958 --> 00:13:10.958\nit's going from light to dark.\n\n00:13:10.958 --> 00:13:13.958\nAnd these four types of information --\n\n00:13:13.958 --> 00:13:17.958\nyour optic nerve has about a million fibers in it,\n\n00:13:17.958 --> 00:13:20.958\nand 900,000 of those fibers\n\n00:13:20.958 --> 00:13:22.958\nsend these four types of information.\n\n00:13:22.958 --> 00:13:26.958\nSo we are really duplicating the kind of signals that you have on the optic nerve.\n\n00:13:26.958 --> 00:13:29.958\nWhat you notice here is that these snapshots\n\n00:13:29.958 --> 00:13:33.958\ntaken from the output of the retina chip are very sparse, right?\n\n00:13:33.958 --> 00:13:35.958\nIt doesn't light up green everywhere in the background,\n\n00:13:35.958 --> 00:13:38.958\nonly on the edges, and then in the hair, and so on.\n\n00:13:38.958 --> 00:13:39.958\nAnd this is the same thing you see\n\n00:13:39.958 --> 00:13:43.958\nwhen people compress video to send: they want to make it very sparse,\n\n00:13:43.958 --> 00:13:46.958\nbecause that file is smaller. And this is what the retina is doing,\n\n00:13:46.958 --> 00:13:50.958\nand it's doing it just with the circuitry, and how this network of neurons\n\n00:13:50.958 --> 00:13:53.958\nthat are interacting in there, which we've captured on the chip.\n\n00:13:53.958 --> 00:13:56.958\nBut the point that I want to make -- I'll show you up here.\n\n00:13:56.958 --> 00:13:59.958\nSo this image here is going to look like these ones,\n\n00:13:59.958 --> 00:14:01.958\nbut here I'll show you that we can reconstruct the image,\n\n00:14:01.958 --> 00:14:06.958\nso, you know, you can almost recognize Kareem in that top part there.\n\n00:14:06.958 --> 00:14:08.958\nAnd so, here you go.\n\n00:14:17.958 --> 00:14:20.958\nYes, so that's the idea.\n\n00:14:20.958 --> 00:14:22.958\nWhen you stand still, you just see the light and dark contrasts.\n\n00:14:22.958 --> 00:14:24.958\nBut when it's moving back and forth,\n\n00:14:24.958 --> 00:14:27.958\nthe retina picks up these changes.\n\n00:14:27.958 --> 00:14:28.958\nAnd that's why, you know, when you're sitting here\n\n00:14:28.958 --> 00:14:30.958\nand something happens in your background,\n\n00:14:30.958 --> 00:14:32.958\nyou merely move your eyes to it.\n\n00:14:32.958 --> 00:14:34.958\nThere are these cells that detect change\n\n00:14:34.958 --> 00:14:36.958\nand you move your attention to it.\n\n00:14:36.958 --> 00:14:38.958\nSo those are very important for catching somebody\n\n00:14:38.958 --> 00:14:40.958\nwho's trying to sneak up on you.\n\n00:14:40.958 --> 00:14:43.958\nLet me just end by saying that this is what happens\n\n00:14:43.958 --> 00:14:46.958\nwhen you put Africa in a piano, OK.\n\n00:14:46.958 --> 00:14:49.958\nThis is a steel drum here that has been modified,\n\n00:14:49.958 --> 00:14:52.958\nand that's what happens when you put Africa in a piano.\n\n00:14:52.958 --> 00:14:56.958\nAnd what I would like us to do is put Africa in the computer,\n\n00:14:56.958 --> 00:14:58.958\nand come up with a new kind of computer\n\n00:14:58.958 --> 00:15:01.958\nthat will generate thought, imagination, be creative and things like that.\n\n00:15:01.958 --> 00:15:03.958\nThank you.\n\n00:15:03.958 --> 00:15:05.958\n(Applause)\n\n00:15:05.958 --> 00:15:07.958\nChris Anderson: Question for you, Kwabena.\n\n00:15:07.958 --> 00:15:11.958\nDo you put together in your mind the work you're doing,\n\n00:15:11.958 --> 00:15:14.958\nthe future of Africa, this conference --\n\n00:15:14.958 --> 00:15:17.958\nwhat connections can we make, if any, between them?\n\n00:15:17.958 --> 00:15:19.958\nKwabena Boahen: Yes, like I said at the beginning,\n\n00:15:19.958 --> 00:15:23.958\nI got my first computer when I was a teenager, growing up in Accra.\n\n00:15:23.958 --> 00:15:27.958\nAnd I had this gut reaction that this was the wrong way to do it.\n\n00:15:27.958 --> 00:15:30.958\nIt was very brute force; it was very inelegant.\n\n00:15:30.958 --> 00:15:32.958\nI don't think that I would've had that reaction,\n\n00:15:32.958 --> 00:15:35.958\nif I'd grown up reading all this science fiction,\n\n00:15:35.958 --> 00:15:39.958\nhearing about RD2D2, whatever it was called, and just -- you know,\n\n00:15:39.958 --> 00:15:40.958\nbuying into this hype about computers.\n\n00:15:40.958 --> 00:15:42.958\nI was coming at it from a different perspective,\n\n00:15:42.958 --> 00:15:44.958\nwhere I was bringing that different perspective\n\n00:15:44.958 --> 00:15:46.958\nto bear on the problem.\n\n00:15:46.958 --> 00:15:49.958\nAnd I think a lot of people in Africa have this different perspective,\n\n00:15:49.958 --> 00:15:51.958\nand I think that's going to impact technology.\n\n00:15:51.958 --> 00:15:53.958\nAnd that's going to impact how it's going to evolve.\n\n00:15:53.958 --> 00:15:55.958\nAnd I think you're going to be able to see, use that infusion,\n\n00:15:55.958 --> 00:15:57.958\nto come up with new things,\n\n00:15:57.958 --> 00:16:00.958\nbecause you're coming from a different perspective.\n\n00:16:00.958 --> 00:16:04.958\nI think we can contribute.

It ties to origami. So let me start. What is origami? Most people think they know what origami is. It's this: flapping birds, toys, cootie catchers, that sort of thing. And that is what origami used to be. But it's become something else. It's become an art form, a form of sculpture.The common theme \u2014 what makes it origami \u2014 is folding is how we create the form. You know, it's very old. This is a plate from 1797. It shows these women playing with these toys. If you look close, it's this shape, called a crane. Every Japanese kid learns how to fold that crane. So this art has been around for hundreds of years, and you would think something that's been around that long \u2014 so restrictive, folding only \u2014 everything that could be done has been done a long time ago. And that might have been the case.But in the twentieth century, a Japanese folder named Yoshizawa came along, and he created tens of thousands of new designs. But even more importantly, he created a language, a way we could communicate, a code of dots, dashes and arrows. Harkening back to Susan Blackmore's talk, we now have a means of transmitting information with heredity and selection, and we know where that leads. And where it has led in origami is to things like this. This is an origami figure \u2014 one sheet, no cuts, folding only, hundreds of folds. This, too, is origami, and this shows where we've gone in the modern world. Naturalism. Detail. You can get horns, antlers \u2014 even, if you look close, cloven hooves.And it raises a question: what changed? And what changed is something you might not have expected in an art, which is math. That is, people applied mathematical principles to the art, to discover the underlying laws. And that leads to a very powerful tool. The secret to productivity in so many fields \u2014 and in origami \u2014 is letting dead people do your work for you.(Laughter)Because what you can do is take your problem, and turn it into a problem that someone else has solved, and use their solutions. And I want to tell you how we did that in origami. Origami revolves around crease patterns. The crease pattern shown here is the underlying blueprint for an origami figure. And you can't just draw them arbitrarily. They have to obey four simple laws. And they're very simple, easy to understand. The first law is two-colorability. You can color any crease pattern with just two colors without ever having the same color meeting. The directions of the folds at any vertex \u2014 the number of mountain folds, the number of valley folds \u2014 always differs by two. Two more or two less. Nothing else. If you look at the angles around the fold, you find that if you number the angles in a circle, all the even-numbered angles add up to a straight line, all the odd-numbered angles add up to a straight line. And if you look at how the layers stack, you'll find that no matter how you stack folds and sheets, a sheet can never penetrate a fold. So that's four simple laws. That's all you need in origami. All of origami comes from that.And you'd think, \"Can four simple laws give rise to that kind of complexity?\" But indeed, the laws of quantum mechanics can be written down on a napkin, and yet they govern all of chemistry, all of life, all of history. If we obey these laws, we can do amazing things. So in origami, to obey these laws, we can take simple patterns \u2014 like this repeating pattern of folds, called textures \u2014 and by itself it's nothing. But if we follow the laws of origami, we can put these patterns into another fold that itself might be something very, very simple, but when we put it together, we get something a little different. This fish, 400 scales \u2014 again, it is one uncut square, only folding. And if you don't want to fold 400 scales, you can back off and just do a few things, and add plates to the back of a turtle, or toes. Or you can ramp up and go up to 50 stars on a flag, with 13 stripes. And if you want to go really crazy, 1,000 scales on a rattlesnake. And this guy's on display downstairs, so take a look if you get a chance.The most powerful tools in origami have related to how we get parts of creatures. And I can put it in this simple equation. We take an idea, combine it with a square, and you get an origami figure.(Laughter)What matters is what we mean by those symbols. And you might say, \"Can you really be that specific? I mean, a stag beetle \u2014 it's got two points for jaws, it's got antennae. Can you be that specific in the detail?\" And yeah, you really can. So how do we do that? Well, we break it down into a few smaller steps. So let me stretch out that equation. I start with my idea. I abstract it. What's the most abstract form? It's a stick figure. And from that stick figure, I somehow have to get to a folded shape that has a part for every bit of the subject, a flap for every leg. And then once I have that folded shape that we call the base, you can make the legs narrower, you can bend them, you can turn it into the finished shape.Now the first step, pretty easy. Take an idea, draw a stick figure. The last step is not so hard, but that middle step \u2014 going from the abstract description to the folded shape \u2014 that's hard. But that's the place where the mathematical ideas can get us over the hump. And I'm going to show you all how to do that so you can go out of here and fold something. But we're going to start small. This base has a lot of flaps in it. We're going to learn how to make one flap. How would you make a single flap? Take a square. Fold it in half, fold it in half, fold it again, until it gets long and narrow, and then we'll say at the end of that, that's a flap. I could use that for a leg, an arm, anything like that.What paper went into that flap? Well, if I unfold it and go back to the crease pattern, you can see that the upper left corner of that shape is the paper that went into the flap. So that's the flap, and all the rest of the paper's left over. I can use it for something else. Well, there are other ways of making a flap. There are other dimensions for flaps. If I make the flaps skinnier, I can use a bit less paper. If I make the flap as skinny as possible, I get to the limit of the minimum amount of paper needed. And you can see there, it needs a quarter-circle of paper to make a flap. There's other ways of making flaps. If I put the flap on the edge, it uses a half circle of paper. And if I make the flap from the middle, it uses a full circle. So, no matter how I make a flap, it needs some part of a circular region of paper. So now we're ready to scale up. What if I want to make something that has a lot of flaps? What do I need? I need a lot of circles.And in the 1990s, origami artists discovered these principles and realized we could make arbitrarily complicated figures just by packing circles. And here's where the dead people start to help us out, because lots of people have studied the problem of packing circles. I can rely on that vast history of mathematicians and artists looking at disc packings and arrangements. And I can use those patterns now to create origami shapes. So we figured out these rules whereby you pack circles, you decorate the patterns of circles with lines according to more rules. That gives you the folds. Those folds fold into a base. You shape the base. You get a folded shape \u2014 in this case, a cockroach. And it's so simple.(Laughter)It's so simple that a computer could do it. And you say, \"Well, you know, how simple is that?\" But computers \u2014 you need to be able to describe things in very basic terms, and with this, we could. So I wrote a computer program a bunch of years ago called TreeMaker, and you can download it from my website. It's free. It runs on all the major platforms \u2014 even Windows.(Laughter)And you just draw a stick figure, and it calculates the crease pattern. It does the circle packing, calculates the crease pattern, and if you use that stick figure that I just showed \u2014 which you can kind of tell, it's a deer, it's got antlers \u2014 you'll get this crease pattern. And if you take this crease pattern, you fold on the dotted lines, you'll get a base that you can then shape into a deer, with exactly the crease pattern that you wanted. And if you want a different deer, not a white-tailed deer, but you want a mule deer, or an elk, you change the packing, and you can do an elk. Or you could do a moose. Or, really, any other kind of deer. These techniques revolutionized this art. We found we could do insects, spiders, which are close, things with legs, things with legs and wings, things with legs and antennae. And if folding a single praying mantis from a single uncut square wasn't interesting enough, then you could do two praying mantises from a single uncut square. She's eating him. I call it \"Snack Time.\"And you can do more than just insects. This \u2014 you can put details, toes and claws. A grizzly bear has claws. This tree frog has toes. Actually, lots of people in origami now put toes into their models. Toes have become an origami meme, because everyone's doing it. You can make multiple subjects. So these are a couple of instrumentalists. The guitar player from a single square, the bass player from a single square. And if you say, \"Well, but the guitar, bass \u2014 that's not so hot. Do a little more complicated instrument.\" Well, then you could do an organ.(Laughter)And what this has allowed is the creation of origami-on-demand. So now people can say, \"I want exactly this and this and this,\" and you can go out and fold it. And sometimes you create high art, and sometimes you pay the bills by doing some commercial work. But I want to show you some examples. Everything you'll see here, except the car, is origami.(Video)(Applause)Just to show you, this really was folded paper. Computers made things move, but these were all real, folded objects that we made. And we can use this not just for visuals, but it turns out to be useful even in the real world. Surprisingly, origami and the structures that we've developed in origami turn out to have applications in medicine, in science, in space, in the body, consumer electronics and more.And I want to show you some of these examples. One of the earliest was this pattern, this folded pattern, studied by Koryo Miura, a Japanese engineer. He studied a folding pattern, and realized this could fold down into an extremely compact package that had a very simple opening and closing structure. And he used it to design this solar array. It's an artist's rendition, but it flew in a Japanese telescope in 1995. Now, there is actually a little origami in the James Webb Space Telescope, but it's very simple. The telescope, going up in space, it unfolds in two places. It folds in thirds. It's a very simple pattern \u2014 you wouldn't even call that origami. They certainly didn't need to talk to origami artists.But if you want to go higher and go larger than this, then you might need some origami. Engineers at Lawrence Livermore National Lab had an idea for a telescope much larger. They called it the Eyeglass. The design called for geosynchronous orbit 25,000 miles up, 100-meter diameter lens. So, imagine a lens the size of a football field. There were two groups of people who were interested in this: planetary scientists, who want to look up, and then other people, who wanted to look down. Whether you look up or look down, how do you get it up in space? You've got to get it up there in a rocket. And rockets are small. So you have to make it smaller. How do you make a large sheet of glass smaller? Well, about the only way is to fold it up somehow. So you have to do something like this. This was a small model.Folded lens, you divide up the panels, you add flexures. But this pattern's not going to work to get something 100 meters down to a few meters. So the Livermore engineers, wanting to make use of the work of dead people, or perhaps live origamists, said, \"Let's see if someone else is doing this sort of thing.\" So they looked into the origami community, we got in touch with them, and I started working with them. And we developed a pattern together that scales to arbitrarily large size, but that allows any flat ring or disc to fold down into a very neat, compact cylinder. And they adopted that for their first generation, which was not 100 meters \u2014 it was a five-meter. But this is a five-meter telescope \u2014 has about a quarter-mile focal length. And it works perfectly on its test range, and it indeed folds up into a neat little bundle.Now, there is other origami in space. Japan Aerospace [Exploration] Agency flew a solar sail, and you can see here that the sail expands out, and you can still see the fold lines. The problem that's being solved here is something that needs to be big and sheet-like at its destination, but needs to be small for the journey. And that works whether you're going into space, or whether you're just going into a body. And this example is the latter. This is a heart stent developed by Zhong You at Oxford University. It holds open a blocked artery when it gets to its destination, but it needs to be much smaller for the trip there, through your blood vessels. And this stent folds down using an origami pattern, based on a model called the water bomb base.Airbag designers also have the problem of getting flat sheets into a small space. And they want to do their design by simulation. So they need to figure out how, in a computer, to flatten an airbag. And the algorithms that we developed to do insects turned out to be the solution for airbags to do their simulation. And so they can do a simulation like this. Those are the origami creases forming, and now you can see the airbag inflate and find out, does it work? And that leads to a really interesting idea.You know, where did these things come from? Well, the heart stent came from that little blow-up box that you might have learned in elementary school. It's the same pattern, called the water bomb base. The airbag-flattening algorithm came from all the developments of circle packing and the mathematical theory that was really developed just to create insects \u2014 things with legs. The thing is, that this often happens in math and science. When you get math involved, problems that you solve for aesthetic value only, or to create something beautiful, turn around and turn out to have an application in the real world. And as weird and surprising as it may sound, origami may someday even save a life.

So let me start.\n\n00:00:23.958 --> 00:00:25.958\nWhat is origami?\n\n00:00:25.958 --> 00:00:28.958\nMost people think they know what origami is. It's this:\n\n00:00:28.958 --> 00:00:31.958\nflapping birds, toys, cootie catchers, that sort of thing.\n\n00:00:31.958 --> 00:00:33.958\nAnd that is what origami used to be.\n\n00:00:33.958 --> 00:00:35.958\nBut it's become something else.\n\n00:00:35.958 --> 00:00:37.958\nIt's become an art form, a form of sculpture.\n\n00:00:37.958 --> 00:00:39.958\nThe common theme -- what makes it origami --\n\n00:00:39.958 --> 00:00:43.958\nis folding is how we create the form.\n\n00:00:43.958 --> 00:00:46.958\nYou know, it's very old. This is a plate from 1797.\n\n00:00:46.958 --> 00:00:48.958\nIt shows these women playing with these toys.\n\n00:00:48.958 --> 00:00:51.958\nIf you look close, it's this shape, called a crane.\n\n00:00:51.958 --> 00:00:53.958\nEvery Japanese kid\n\n00:00:53.958 --> 00:00:55.958\nlearns how to fold that crane.\n\n00:00:55.958 --> 00:00:57.958\nSo this art has been around for hundreds of years,\n\n00:00:57.958 --> 00:00:59.958\nand you would think something\n\n00:00:59.958 --> 00:01:02.958\nthat's been around that long -- so restrictive, folding only --\n\n00:01:02.958 --> 00:01:05.958\neverything that could be done has been done a long time ago.\n\n00:01:05.958 --> 00:01:07.958\nAnd that might have been the case.\n\n00:01:07.958 --> 00:01:09.958\nBut in the twentieth century,\n\n00:01:09.958 --> 00:01:12.958\na Japanese folder named Yoshizawa came along,\n\n00:01:12.958 --> 00:01:15.958\nand he created tens of thousands of new designs.\n\n00:01:15.958 --> 00:01:18.958\nBut even more importantly, he created a language,\n\n00:01:18.958 --> 00:01:20.958\na way we could communicate,\n\n00:01:20.958 --> 00:01:22.958\na code of dots, dashes and arrows.\n\n00:01:22.958 --> 00:01:24.958\nHarkening back to Susan Blackmore's talk,\n\n00:01:24.958 --> 00:01:26.958\nwe now have a means of transmitting information\n\n00:01:26.958 --> 00:01:29.958\nwith heredity and selection,\n\n00:01:29.958 --> 00:01:31.958\nand we know where that leads.\n\n00:01:31.958 --> 00:01:33.958\nAnd where it has led in origami\n\n00:01:33.958 --> 00:01:35.958\nis to things like this.\n\n00:01:35.958 --> 00:01:37.958\nThis is an origami figure --\n\n00:01:37.958 --> 00:01:41.958\none sheet, no cuts, folding only, hundreds of folds.\n\n00:01:43.958 --> 00:01:45.958\nThis, too, is origami,\n\n00:01:45.958 --> 00:01:48.958\nand this shows where we've gone in the modern world.\n\n00:01:48.958 --> 00:01:50.958\nNaturalism. Detail.\n\n00:01:50.958 --> 00:01:52.958\nYou can get horns, antlers --\n\n00:01:52.958 --> 00:01:54.958\neven, if you look close, cloven hooves.\n\n00:01:54.958 --> 00:01:57.958\nAnd it raises a question: what changed?\n\n00:01:57.958 --> 00:01:59.958\nAnd what changed is something\n\n00:01:59.958 --> 00:02:02.958\nyou might not have expected in an art,\n\n00:02:02.958 --> 00:02:04.958\nwhich is math.\n\n00:02:04.958 --> 00:02:06.958\nThat is, people applied mathematical principles\n\n00:02:06.958 --> 00:02:09.958\nto the art,\n\n00:02:09.958 --> 00:02:11.958\nto discover the underlying laws.\n\n00:02:11.958 --> 00:02:14.958\nAnd that leads to a very powerful tool.\n\n00:02:14.958 --> 00:02:16.958\nThe secret to productivity in so many fields --\n\n00:02:16.958 --> 00:02:18.958\nand in origami --\n\n00:02:18.958 --> 00:02:21.958\nis letting dead people do your work for you.\n\n00:02:21.958 --> 00:02:22.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:02:22.958 --> 00:02:24.958\nBecause what you can do is\n\n00:02:24.958 --> 00:02:26.958\ntake your problem,\n\n00:02:26.958 --> 00:02:29.958\nand turn it into a problem that someone else has solved,\n\n00:02:29.958 --> 00:02:31.958\nand use their solutions.\n\n00:02:31.958 --> 00:02:34.958\nAnd I want to tell you how we did that in origami.\n\n00:02:34.958 --> 00:02:36.958\nOrigami revolves around crease patterns.\n\n00:02:36.958 --> 00:02:38.958\nThe crease pattern shown here is the underlying blueprint\n\n00:02:39.958 --> 00:02:41.958\nfor an origami figure.\n\n00:02:41.958 --> 00:02:43.958\nAnd you can't just draw them arbitrarily.\n\n00:02:43.958 --> 00:02:46.958\nThey have to obey four simple laws.\n\n00:02:46.958 --> 00:02:48.958\nAnd they're very simple, easy to understand.\n\n00:02:48.958 --> 00:02:51.958\nThe first law is two-colorability. You can color any crease pattern\n\n00:02:51.958 --> 00:02:53.958\nwith just two colors without ever having\n\n00:02:53.958 --> 00:02:56.958\nthe same color meeting.\n\n00:02:56.958 --> 00:02:59.958\nThe directions of the folds at any vertex --\n\n00:02:59.958 --> 00:03:02.958\nthe number of mountain folds, the number of valley folds --\n\n00:03:02.958 --> 00:03:04.958\nalways differs by two. Two more or two less.\n\n00:03:04.958 --> 00:03:06.958\nNothing else.\n\n00:03:06.958 --> 00:03:08.958\nIf you look at the angles around the fold,\n\n00:03:08.958 --> 00:03:10.958\nyou find that if you number the angles in a circle,\n\n00:03:10.958 --> 00:03:13.958\nall the even-numbered angles add up to a straight line,\n\n00:03:13.958 --> 00:03:16.958\nall the odd-numbered angles add up to a straight line.\n\n00:03:16.958 --> 00:03:18.958\nAnd if you look at how the layers stack,\n\n00:03:18.958 --> 00:03:21.958\nyou'll find that no matter how you stack folds and sheets,\n\n00:03:21.958 --> 00:03:23.958\na sheet can never\n\n00:03:23.958 --> 00:03:25.958\npenetrate a fold.\n\n00:03:25.958 --> 00:03:28.958\nSo that's four simple laws. That's all you need in origami.\n\n00:03:28.958 --> 00:03:30.958\nAll of origami comes from that.\n\n00:03:30.958 --> 00:03:32.958\nAnd you'd think, \"Can four simple laws\n\n00:03:32.958 --> 00:03:34.958\ngive rise to that kind of complexity?\"\n\n00:03:34.958 --> 00:03:36.958\nBut indeed, the laws of quantum mechanics\n\n00:03:36.958 --> 00:03:38.958\ncan be written down on a napkin,\n\n00:03:38.958 --> 00:03:40.958\nand yet they govern all of chemistry,\n\n00:03:40.958 --> 00:03:42.958\nall of life, all of history.\n\n00:03:42.958 --> 00:03:44.958\nIf we obey these laws,\n\n00:03:44.958 --> 00:03:46.958\nwe can do amazing things.\n\n00:03:46.958 --> 00:03:48.958\nSo in origami, to obey these laws,\n\n00:03:48.958 --> 00:03:50.958\nwe can take simple patterns --\n\n00:03:50.958 --> 00:03:53.958\nlike this repeating pattern of folds, called textures --\n\n00:03:53.958 --> 00:03:55.958\nand by itself it's nothing.\n\n00:03:55.958 --> 00:03:57.958\nBut if we follow the laws of origami,\n\n00:03:57.958 --> 00:04:00.958\nwe can put these patterns into another fold\n\n00:04:00.958 --> 00:04:02.958\nthat itself might be something very, very simple,\n\n00:04:02.958 --> 00:04:04.958\nbut when we put it together,\n\n00:04:04.958 --> 00:04:06.958\nwe get something a little different.\n\n00:04:06.958 --> 00:04:09.958\nThis fish, 400 scales --\n\n00:04:09.958 --> 00:04:12.958\nagain, it is one uncut square, only folding.\n\n00:04:13.958 --> 00:04:15.958\nAnd if you don't want to fold 400 scales,\n\n00:04:15.958 --> 00:04:17.958\nyou can back off and just do a few things,\n\n00:04:17.958 --> 00:04:20.958\nand add plates to the back of a turtle, or toes.\n\n00:04:20.958 --> 00:04:23.958\nOr you can ramp up and go up to 50 stars\n\n00:04:23.958 --> 00:04:26.958\non a flag, with 13 stripes.\n\n00:04:26.958 --> 00:04:29.958\nAnd if you want to go really crazy,\n\n00:04:29.958 --> 00:04:31.958\n1,000 scales on a rattlesnake.\n\n00:04:31.958 --> 00:04:33.958\nAnd this guy's on display downstairs,\n\n00:04:33.958 --> 00:04:36.958\nso take a look if you get a chance.\n\n00:04:36.958 --> 00:04:38.958\nThe most powerful tools in origami\n\n00:04:38.958 --> 00:04:41.958\nhave related to how we get parts of creatures.\n\n00:04:41.958 --> 00:04:43.958\nAnd I can put it in this simple equation.\n\n00:04:43.958 --> 00:04:45.958\nWe take an idea,\n\n00:04:45.958 --> 00:04:48.958\ncombine it with a square, and you get an origami figure.\n\n00:04:48.958 --> 00:04:52.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:04:52.958 --> 00:04:54.958\nWhat matters is what we mean by those symbols.\n\n00:04:54.958 --> 00:04:57.958\nAnd you might say, \"Can you really be that specific?\n\n00:04:57.958 --> 00:04:59.958\nI mean, a stag beetle -- it's got two points for jaws,\n\n00:04:59.958 --> 00:05:03.958\nit's got antennae. Can you be that specific in the detail?\"\n\n00:05:03.958 --> 00:05:06.958\nAnd yeah, you really can.\n\n00:05:06.958 --> 00:05:09.958\nSo how do we do that? Well, we break it down\n\n00:05:09.958 --> 00:05:11.958\ninto a few smaller steps.\n\n00:05:11.958 --> 00:05:13.958\nSo let me stretch out that equation.\n\n00:05:13.958 --> 00:05:16.958\nI start with my idea. I abstract it.\n\n00:05:16.958 --> 00:05:19.958\nWhat's the most abstract form? It's a stick figure.\n\n00:05:19.958 --> 00:05:22.958\nAnd from that stick figure, I somehow have to get to a folded shape\n\n00:05:22.958 --> 00:05:25.958\nthat has a part for every bit of the subject,\n\n00:05:25.958 --> 00:05:27.958\na flap for every leg.\n\n00:05:27.958 --> 00:05:30.958\nAnd then once I have that folded shape that we call the base,\n\n00:05:30.958 --> 00:05:33.958\nyou can make the legs narrower, you can bend them,\n\n00:05:33.958 --> 00:05:35.958\nyou can turn it into the finished shape.\n\n00:05:35.958 --> 00:05:37.958\nNow the first step, pretty easy.\n\n00:05:37.958 --> 00:05:39.958\nTake an idea, draw a stick figure.\n\n00:05:39.958 --> 00:05:42.958\nThe last step is not so hard, but that middle step --\n\n00:05:42.958 --> 00:05:45.958\ngoing from the abstract description to the folded shape --\n\n00:05:45.958 --> 00:05:47.958\nthat's hard.\n\n00:05:47.958 --> 00:05:49.958\nBut that's the place where the mathematical ideas\n\n00:05:49.958 --> 00:05:51.958\ncan get us over the hump.\n\n00:05:51.958 --> 00:05:53.958\nAnd I'm going to show you all how to do that\n\n00:05:53.958 --> 00:05:55.958\nso you can go out of here and fold something.\n\n00:05:55.958 --> 00:05:57.958\nBut we're going to start small.\n\n00:05:57.958 --> 00:05:59.958\nThis base has a lot of flaps in it.\n\n00:05:59.958 --> 00:06:02.958\nWe're going to learn how to make one flap.\n\n00:06:02.958 --> 00:06:04.958\nHow would you make a single flap?\n\n00:06:04.958 --> 00:06:07.958\nTake a square. Fold it in half, fold it in half, fold it again,\n\n00:06:07.958 --> 00:06:09.958\nuntil it gets long and narrow,\n\n00:06:09.958 --> 00:06:11.958\nand then we'll say at the end of that, that's a flap.\n\n00:06:11.958 --> 00:06:14.958\nI could use that for a leg, an arm, anything like that.\n\n00:06:14.958 --> 00:06:16.958\nWhat paper went into that flap?\n\n00:06:16.958 --> 00:06:18.958\nWell, if I unfold it and go back to the crease pattern,\n\n00:06:18.958 --> 00:06:21.958\nyou can see that the upper left corner of that shape\n\n00:06:21.958 --> 00:06:23.958\nis the paper that went into the flap.\n\n00:06:23.958 --> 00:06:26.958\nSo that's the flap, and all the rest of the paper's left over.\n\n00:06:26.958 --> 00:06:28.958\nI can use it for something else.\n\n00:06:28.958 --> 00:06:30.958\nWell, there are other ways of making a flap.\n\n00:06:30.958 --> 00:06:32.958\nThere are other dimensions for flaps.\n\n00:06:32.958 --> 00:06:35.958\nIf I make the flaps skinnier, I can use a bit less paper.\n\n00:06:35.958 --> 00:06:38.958\nIf I make the flap as skinny as possible,\n\n00:06:38.958 --> 00:06:41.958\nI get to the limit of the minimum amount of paper needed.\n\n00:06:41.958 --> 00:06:44.958\nAnd you can see there, it needs a quarter-circle of paper to make a flap.\n\n00:06:45.958 --> 00:06:47.958\nThere's other ways of making flaps.\n\n00:06:47.958 --> 00:06:50.958\nIf I put the flap on the edge, it uses a half circle of paper.\n\n00:06:50.958 --> 00:06:53.958\nAnd if I make the flap from the middle, it uses a full circle.\n\n00:06:53.958 --> 00:06:55.958\nSo, no matter how I make a flap,\n\n00:06:55.958 --> 00:06:57.958\nit needs some part\n\n00:06:57.958 --> 00:06:59.958\nof a circular region of paper.\n\n00:06:59.958 --> 00:07:01.958\nSo now we're ready to scale up.\n\n00:07:01.958 --> 00:07:04.958\nWhat if I want to make something that has a lot of flaps?\n\n00:07:04.958 --> 00:07:07.958\nWhat do I need? I need a lot of circles.\n\n00:07:08.958 --> 00:07:10.958\nAnd in the 1990s,\n\n00:07:10.958 --> 00:07:12.958\norigami artists discovered these principles\n\n00:07:12.958 --> 00:07:15.958\nand realized we could make arbitrarily complicated figures\n\n00:07:15.958 --> 00:07:18.958\njust by packing circles.\n\n00:07:18.958 --> 00:07:21.958\nAnd here's where the dead people start to help us out,\n\n00:07:21.958 --> 00:07:24.958\nbecause lots of people have studied\n\n00:07:24.958 --> 00:07:26.958\nthe problem of packing circles.\n\n00:07:26.958 --> 00:07:29.958\nI can rely on that vast history of mathematicians and artists\n\n00:07:29.958 --> 00:07:32.958\nlooking at disc packings and arrangements.\n\n00:07:32.958 --> 00:07:35.958\nAnd I can use those patterns now to create origami shapes.\n\n00:07:36.958 --> 00:07:38.958\nSo we figured out these rules whereby you pack circles,\n\n00:07:38.958 --> 00:07:41.958\nyou decorate the patterns of circles with lines\n\n00:07:41.958 --> 00:07:43.958\naccording to more rules. That gives you the folds.\n\n00:07:43.958 --> 00:07:46.958\nThose folds fold into a base. You shape the base.\n\n00:07:46.958 --> 00:07:49.958\nYou get a folded shape -- in this case, a cockroach.\n\n00:07:50.958 --> 00:07:52.958\nAnd it's so simple.\n\n00:07:52.958 --> 00:07:55.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:07:55.958 --> 00:07:58.958\nIt's so simple that a computer could do it.\n\n00:07:58.958 --> 00:08:00.958\nAnd you say, \"Well, you know, how simple is that?\"\n\n00:08:00.958 --> 00:08:02.958\nBut computers -- you need to be able to describe things\n\n00:08:02.958 --> 00:08:05.958\nin very basic terms, and with this, we could.\n\n00:08:05.958 --> 00:08:07.958\nSo I wrote a computer program a bunch of years ago\n\n00:08:07.958 --> 00:08:09.958\ncalled TreeMaker, and you can download it from my website.\n\n00:08:09.958 --> 00:08:12.958\nIt's free. It runs on all the major platforms -- even Windows.\n\n00:08:12.958 --> 00:08:14.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:08:14.958 --> 00:08:16.958\nAnd you just draw a stick figure,\n\n00:08:16.958 --> 00:08:18.958\nand it calculates the crease pattern.\n\n00:08:18.958 --> 00:08:21.958\nIt does the circle packing, calculates the crease pattern,\n\n00:08:21.958 --> 00:08:23.958\nand if you use that stick figure that I just showed --\n\n00:08:23.958 --> 00:08:26.958\nwhich you can kind of tell, it's a deer, it's got antlers --\n\n00:08:26.958 --> 00:08:28.958\nyou'll get this crease pattern.\n\n00:08:28.958 --> 00:08:30.958\nAnd if you take this crease pattern, you fold on the dotted lines,\n\n00:08:30.958 --> 00:08:33.958\nyou'll get a base that you can then shape\n\n00:08:33.958 --> 00:08:35.958\ninto a deer,\n\n00:08:35.958 --> 00:08:37.958\nwith exactly the crease pattern that you wanted.\n\n00:08:37.958 --> 00:08:39.958\nAnd if you want a different deer,\n\n00:08:39.958 --> 00:08:42.958\nnot a white-tailed deer, but you want a mule deer, or an elk,\n\n00:08:42.958 --> 00:08:44.958\nyou change the packing,\n\n00:08:44.958 --> 00:08:46.958\nand you can do an elk.\n\n00:08:46.958 --> 00:08:48.958\nOr you could do a moose.\n\n00:08:48.958 --> 00:08:50.958\nOr, really, any other kind of deer.\n\n00:08:50.958 --> 00:08:53.958\nThese techniques revolutionized this art.\n\n00:08:53.958 --> 00:08:55.958\nWe found we could do insects,\n\n00:08:55.958 --> 00:08:57.958\nspiders, which are close,\n\n00:08:57.958 --> 00:09:00.958\nthings with legs, things with legs and wings,\n\n00:09:01.958 --> 00:09:03.958\nthings with legs and antennae.\n\n00:09:03.958 --> 00:09:06.958\nAnd if folding a single praying mantis from a single uncut square\n\n00:09:06.958 --> 00:09:08.958\nwasn't interesting enough,\n\n00:09:08.958 --> 00:09:10.958\nthen you could do two praying mantises\n\n00:09:10.958 --> 00:09:12.958\nfrom a single uncut square.\n\n00:09:12.958 --> 00:09:14.958\nShe's eating him.\n\n00:09:14.958 --> 00:09:17.958\nI call it \"Snack Time.\"\n\n00:09:17.958 --> 00:09:19.958\nAnd you can do more than just insects.\n\n00:09:19.958 --> 00:09:21.958\nThis -- you can put details,\n\n00:09:21.958 --> 00:09:24.958\ntoes and claws. A grizzly bear has claws.\n\n00:09:24.958 --> 00:09:26.958\nThis tree frog has toes.\n\n00:09:26.958 --> 00:09:29.958\nActually, lots of people in origami now put toes into their models.\n\n00:09:29.958 --> 00:09:31.958\nToes have become an origami meme,\n\n00:09:31.958 --> 00:09:34.958\nbecause everyone's doing it.\n\n00:09:34.958 --> 00:09:36.958\nYou can make multiple subjects.\n\n00:09:36.958 --> 00:09:38.958\nSo these are a couple of instrumentalists.\n\n00:09:38.958 --> 00:09:41.958\nThe guitar player from a single square,\n\n00:09:41.958 --> 00:09:43.958\nthe bass player from a single square.\n\n00:09:43.958 --> 00:09:45.958\nAnd if you say, \"Well, but the guitar, bass --\n\n00:09:45.958 --> 00:09:47.958\nthat's not so hot.\n\n00:09:47.958 --> 00:09:49.958\nDo a little more complicated instrument.\"\n\n00:09:49.958 --> 00:09:51.958\nWell, then you could do an organ.\n\n00:09:51.958 --> 00:09:54.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:09:54.958 --> 00:09:56.958\nAnd what this has allowed is the creation\n\n00:09:56.958 --> 00:09:58.958\nof origami-on-demand.\n\n00:09:58.958 --> 00:10:01.958\nSo now people can say, \"I want exactly this and this and this,\"\n\n00:10:01.958 --> 00:10:04.958\nand you can go out and fold it.\n\n00:10:04.958 --> 00:10:06.958\nAnd sometimes you create high art,\n\n00:10:06.958 --> 00:10:09.958\nand sometimes you pay the bills by doing some commercial work.\n\n00:10:09.958 --> 00:10:11.958\nBut I want to show you some examples.\n\n00:10:11.958 --> 00:10:13.958\nEverything you'll see here,\n\n00:10:13.958 --> 00:10:16.958\nexcept the car, is origami.\n\n00:10:16.958 --> 00:10:44.958\n(Video)\n\n00:10:44.958 --> 00:10:47.958\n(Applause)\n\n00:10:47.958 --> 00:10:50.958\nJust to show you, this really was folded paper.\n\n00:10:50.958 --> 00:10:52.958\nComputers made things move,\n\n00:10:52.958 --> 00:10:55.958\nbut these were all real, folded objects that we made.\n\n00:10:56.958 --> 00:10:59.958\nAnd we can use this not just for visuals,\n\n00:10:59.958 --> 00:11:02.958\nbut it turns out to be useful even in the real world.\n\n00:11:02.958 --> 00:11:03.958\nSurprisingly, origami\n\n00:11:03.958 --> 00:11:06.958\nand the structures that we've developed in origami\n\n00:11:06.958 --> 00:11:09.958\nturn out to have applications in medicine, in science,\n\n00:11:09.958 --> 00:11:12.958\nin space, in the body, consumer electronics and more.\n\n00:11:12.958 --> 00:11:15.958\nAnd I want to show you some of these examples.\n\n00:11:15.958 --> 00:11:17.958\nOne of the earliest was this pattern,\n\n00:11:17.958 --> 00:11:19.958\nthis folded pattern,\n\n00:11:19.958 --> 00:11:22.958\nstudied by Koryo Miura, a Japanese engineer.\n\n00:11:22.958 --> 00:11:24.958\nHe studied a folding pattern, and realized\n\n00:11:24.958 --> 00:11:27.958\nthis could fold down into an extremely compact package\n\n00:11:27.958 --> 00:11:30.958\nthat had a very simple opening and closing structure.\n\n00:11:30.958 --> 00:11:33.958\nAnd he used it to design this solar array.\n\n00:11:33.958 --> 00:11:36.958\nIt's an artist's rendition, but it flew in a Japanese telescope\n\n00:11:36.958 --> 00:11:38.958\nin 1995.\n\n00:11:38.958 --> 00:11:40.958\nNow, there is actually a little origami\n\n00:11:40.958 --> 00:11:43.958\nin the James Webb Space Telescope, but it's very simple.\n\n00:11:43.958 --> 00:11:45.958\nThe telescope, going up in space,\n\n00:11:45.958 --> 00:11:48.958\nit unfolds in two places.\n\n00:11:48.958 --> 00:11:50.958\nIt folds in thirds. It's a very simple pattern --\n\n00:11:50.958 --> 00:11:52.958\nyou wouldn't even call that origami.\n\n00:11:52.958 --> 00:11:55.958\nThey certainly didn't need to talk to origami artists.\n\n00:11:55.958 --> 00:11:58.958\nBut if you want to go higher and go larger than this,\n\n00:11:58.958 --> 00:12:00.958\nthen you might need some origami.\n\n00:12:00.958 --> 00:12:02.958\nEngineers at Lawrence Livermore National Lab\n\n00:12:02.958 --> 00:12:05.958\nhad an idea for a telescope much larger.\n\n00:12:05.958 --> 00:12:07.958\nThey called it the Eyeglass.\n\n00:12:07.958 --> 00:12:09.958\nThe design called for geosynchronous orbit\n\n00:12:09.958 --> 00:12:11.958\n25,000 miles up,\n\n00:12:11.958 --> 00:12:14.958\n100-meter diameter lens.\n\n00:12:14.958 --> 00:12:17.958\nSo, imagine a lens the size of a football field.\n\n00:12:17.958 --> 00:12:19.958\nThere were two groups of people who were interested in this:\n\n00:12:19.958 --> 00:12:22.958\nplanetary scientists, who want to look up,\n\n00:12:22.958 --> 00:12:25.958\nand then other people, who wanted to look down.\n\n00:12:26.958 --> 00:12:28.958\nWhether you look up or look down,\n\n00:12:28.958 --> 00:12:31.958\nhow do you get it up in space? You've got to get it up there in a rocket.\n\n00:12:31.958 --> 00:12:34.958\nAnd rockets are small. So you have to make it smaller.\n\n00:12:34.958 --> 00:12:36.958\nHow do you make a large sheet of glass smaller?\n\n00:12:36.958 --> 00:12:39.958\nWell, about the only way is to fold it up somehow.\n\n00:12:39.958 --> 00:12:41.958\nSo you have to do something like this.\n\n00:12:41.958 --> 00:12:43.958\nThis was a small model.\n\n00:12:44.958 --> 00:12:46.958\nFolded lens, you divide up the panels, you add flexures.\n\n00:12:46.958 --> 00:12:49.958\nBut this pattern's not going to work\n\n00:12:49.958 --> 00:12:52.958\nto get something 100 meters down to a few meters.\n\n00:12:52.958 --> 00:12:54.958\nSo the Livermore engineers,\n\n00:12:54.958 --> 00:12:56.958\nwanting to make use of the work of dead people,\n\n00:12:56.958 --> 00:12:59.958\nor perhaps live origamists, said,\n\n00:12:59.958 --> 00:13:02.958\n\"Let's see if someone else is doing this sort of thing.\"\n\n00:13:02.958 --> 00:13:05.958\nSo they looked into the origami community,\n\n00:13:05.958 --> 00:13:07.958\nwe got in touch with them, and I started working with them.\n\n00:13:07.958 --> 00:13:09.958\nAnd we developed a pattern together\n\n00:13:09.958 --> 00:13:11.958\nthat scales to arbitrarily large size,\n\n00:13:11.958 --> 00:13:15.958\nbut that allows any flat ring or disc\n\n00:13:15.958 --> 00:13:18.958\nto fold down into a very neat, compact cylinder.\n\n00:13:18.958 --> 00:13:20.958\nAnd they adopted that for their first generation,\n\n00:13:20.958 --> 00:13:22.958\nwhich was not 100 meters -- it was a five-meter.\n\n00:13:22.958 --> 00:13:24.958\nBut this is a five-meter telescope --\n\n00:13:24.958 --> 00:13:26.958\nhas about a quarter-mile focal length.\n\n00:13:26.958 --> 00:13:28.958\nAnd it works perfectly on its test range,\n\n00:13:28.958 --> 00:13:31.958\nand it indeed folds up into a neat little bundle.\n\n00:13:32.958 --> 00:13:34.958\nNow, there is other origami in space.\n\n00:13:34.958 --> 00:13:37.958\nJapan Aerospace [Exploration] Agency flew a solar sail,\n\n00:13:37.958 --> 00:13:40.958\nand you can see here that the sail expands out,\n\n00:13:40.958 --> 00:13:42.958\nand you can still see the fold lines.\n\n00:13:42.958 --> 00:13:45.958\nThe problem that's being solved here is\n\n00:13:45.958 --> 00:13:48.958\nsomething that needs to be big and sheet-like at its destination,\n\n00:13:48.958 --> 00:13:50.958\nbut needs to be small for the journey.\n\n00:13:50.958 --> 00:13:53.958\nAnd that works whether you're going into space,\n\n00:13:53.958 --> 00:13:56.958\nor whether you're just going into a body.\n\n00:13:56.958 --> 00:13:58.958\nAnd this example is the latter.\n\n00:13:58.958 --> 00:14:01.958\nThis is a heart stent developed by Zhong You\n\n00:14:01.958 --> 00:14:03.958\nat Oxford University.\n\n00:14:03.958 --> 00:14:06.958\nIt holds open a blocked artery when it gets to its destination,\n\n00:14:06.958 --> 00:14:09.958\nbut it needs to be much smaller for the trip there,\n\n00:14:09.958 --> 00:14:11.958\nthrough your blood vessels.\n\n00:14:11.958 --> 00:14:14.958\nAnd this stent folds down using an origami pattern,\n\n00:14:14.958 --> 00:14:17.958\nbased on a model called the water bomb base.\n\n00:14:18.958 --> 00:14:20.958\nAirbag designers also have the problem\n\n00:14:20.958 --> 00:14:22.958\nof getting flat sheets\n\n00:14:22.958 --> 00:14:25.958\ninto a small space.\n\n00:14:25.958 --> 00:14:27.958\nAnd they want to do their design by simulation.\n\n00:14:27.958 --> 00:14:29.958\nSo they need to figure out how, in a computer,\n\n00:14:29.958 --> 00:14:31.958\nto flatten an airbag.\n\n00:14:31.958 --> 00:14:33.958\nAnd the algorithms that we developed\n\n00:14:33.958 --> 00:14:35.958\nto do insects\n\n00:14:35.958 --> 00:14:38.958\nturned out to be the solution for airbags\n\n00:14:38.958 --> 00:14:40.958\nto do their simulation.\n\n00:14:40.958 --> 00:14:43.958\nAnd so they can do a simulation like this.\n\n00:14:43.958 --> 00:14:45.958\nThose are the origami creases forming,\n\n00:14:45.958 --> 00:14:47.958\nand now you can see the airbag inflate\n\n00:14:47.958 --> 00:14:50.958\nand find out, does it work?\n\n00:14:50.958 --> 00:14:52.958\nAnd that leads\n\n00:14:52.958 --> 00:14:54.958\nto a really interesting idea.\n\n00:14:54.958 --> 00:14:57.958\nYou know, where did these things come from?\n\n00:14:57.958 --> 00:14:59.958\nWell, the heart stent\n\n00:14:59.958 --> 00:15:01.958\ncame from that little blow-up box\n\n00:15:01.958 --> 00:15:04.958\nthat you might have learned in elementary school.\n\n00:15:04.958 --> 00:15:07.958\nIt's the same pattern, called the water bomb base.\n\n00:15:07.958 --> 00:15:09.958\nThe airbag-flattening algorithm\n\n00:15:09.958 --> 00:15:11.958\ncame from all the developments\n\n00:15:11.958 --> 00:15:14.958\nof circle packing and the mathematical theory\n\n00:15:14.958 --> 00:15:16.958\nthat was really developed\n\n00:15:16.958 --> 00:15:19.958\njust to create insects -- things with legs.\n\n00:15:20.958 --> 00:15:22.958\nThe thing is, that this often happens\n\n00:15:22.958 --> 00:15:24.958\nin math and science.\n\n00:15:24.958 --> 00:15:27.958\nWhen you get math involved, problems that you solve\n\n00:15:27.958 --> 00:15:29.958\nfor aesthetic value only,\n\n00:15:29.958 --> 00:15:31.958\nor to create something beautiful,\n\n00:15:31.958 --> 00:15:33.958\nturn around and turn out\n\n00:15:33.958 --> 00:15:36.958\nto have an application in the real world.\n\n00:15:36.958 --> 00:15:39.958\nAnd as weird and surprising as it may sound,\n\n00:15:39.958 --> 00:15:42.958\norigami may someday even save a life.\n\n00:15:43.958 --> 00:15:45.958\nThanks.\n\n00:15:45.958 -->

For most of my research career, I've been using accelerators, such as the electron accelerator at Stanford University, just up the road, to study things on the smallest scale. But more recently, I've been turning my attention to the universe on the largest scale. Because, as I'll explain to you, the questions on the smallest and the largest scale are actually very connected. So I'm going to tell you about our twenty-first-century view of the universe, what it's made of and what the big questions in the physical sciences are \u2014 at least some of the big questions.So, recently, we have realized that the ordinary matter in the universe \u2014 and by ordinary matter, I mean you, me, the planets, the stars, the galaxies \u2014 the ordinary matter makes up only a few percent of the content of the universe. Almost a quarter, or approximately a quarter of the matter in the universe, is stuff that's invisible. By invisible, I mean it doesn't absorb in the electromagnetic spectrum. It doesn't emit in the electromagnetic spectrum. It doesn't reflect. It doesn't interact with the electromagnetic spectrum, which is what we use to detect things. It doesn't interact at all. So how do we know it's there? We know it's there by its gravitational effects. In fact, this dark matter dominates the gravitational effects in the universe on a large scale, and I'll be telling you about the evidence for that.What about the rest of the pie? The rest of the pie is a very mysterious substance called dark energy. More about that later, OK. So for now, let's turn to the evidence for dark matter. In these galaxies, especially in a spiral galaxy like this, most of the mass of the stars is concentrated in the middle of the galaxy. This huge mass of all these stars keeps stars in circular orbits in the galaxy. So we have these stars going around in circles like this. As you can imagine, even if you know physics, this should be intuitive, OK \u2014 that stars that are closer to the mass in the middle will be rotating at a higher speed than those that are further out here, OK.So what you would expect is that if you measured the orbital speed of the stars, that they should be slower on the edges than on the inside. In other words, if we measured speed as a function of distance \u2014 this is the only time I'm going to show a graph, OK \u2014 we would expect that it goes down as the distance increases from the center of the galaxy. When those measurements are made, instead what we find is that the speed is basically constant, as a function of distance. If it's constant, that means that the stars out here are feeling the gravitational effects of matter that we do not see. In fact, this galaxy and every other galaxy appears to be embedded in a cloud of this invisible dark matter. And this cloud of matter is much more spherical than the galaxy themselves, and it extends over a much wider range than the galaxy. So we see the galaxy and fixate on that, but it's actually a cloud of dark matter that's dominating the structure and the dynamics of this galaxy.Galaxies themselves are not strewn randomly in space; they tend to cluster. And this is an example of a very, actually, famous cluster, the Coma cluster. And there are thousands of galaxies in this cluster. They're the white, fuzzy, elliptical things here. So these galaxy clusters \u2014 we take a snapshot now, we take a snapshot in a decade, it'll look identical. But these galaxies are actually moving at extremely high speeds. They're moving around in this gravitational potential well of this cluster, OK. So all of these galaxies are moving. We can measure the speeds of these galaxies, their orbital velocities, and figure out how much mass is in this cluster.And again, what we find is that there is much more mass there than can be accounted for by the galaxies that we see. Or if we look in other parts of the electromagnetic spectrum, we see that there's a lot of gas in this cluster, as well. But that cannot account for the mass either. In fact, there appears to be about ten times as much mass here in the form of this invisible or dark matter as there is in the ordinary matter, OK. It would be nice if we could see this dark matter a little bit more directly. I'm just putting this big, blue blob on there, OK, to try to remind you that it's there. Can we see it more visually? Yes, we can.And so let me lead you through how we can do this. So here's an observer: it could be an eye; it could be a telescope. And suppose there's a galaxy out here in the universe. How do we see that galaxy? A ray of light leaves the galaxy and travels through the universe for perhaps billions of years before it enters the telescope or your eye. Now, how do we deduce where the galaxy is? Well, we deduce it by the direction that the ray is traveling as it enters our eye, right? We say, the ray of light came this way; the galaxy must be there, OK. Now, suppose I put in the middle a cluster of galaxies \u2014 and don't forget the dark matter, OK. Now, if we consider a different ray of light, one going off like this, we now need to take into account what Einstein predicted when he developed general relativity. And that was that the gravitational field, due to mass, will deflect not only the trajectory of particles, but will deflect light itself.So this light ray will not continue in a straight line, but would rather bend and could end up going into our eye. Where will this observer see the galaxy? You can respond. Up, right? We extrapolate backwards and say the galaxy is up here. Is there any other ray of light that could make into the observer's eye from that galaxy? Yes, great. I see people going down like this. So a ray of light could go down, be bent up into the observer's eye, and the observer sees a ray of light here.Now, take into account the fact that we live in a three-dimensional universe, OK, a three-dimensional space. Are there any other rays of light that could make it into the eye? Yes! The rays would lie on a \u2014 I'd like to see \u2014 yeah, on a cone. So there's a whole ray of light \u2014 rays of light on a cone \u2014 that will all be bent by that cluster and make it into the observer's eye. If there is a cone of light coming into my eye, what do I see? A circle, a ring. It's called an Einstein ring. Einstein predicted that, OK. Now, it will only be a perfect ring if the source, the deflector and the eyeball, in this case, are all in a perfectly straight line. If they're slightly skewed, we'll see a different image.Now, you can do an experiment tonight over the reception, OK, to figure out what that image will look like. Because it turns out that there is a kind of lens that we can devise, that has the right shape to produce this kind of effect. We call this gravitational lensing. And so, this is your instrument, OK. (Laughter). But ignore the top part. It's the base that I want you to concentrate, OK. So, actually, at home, whenever we break a wineglass, I save the bottom, take it over to the machine shop. We shave it off, and I have a little gravitational lens, OK. So it's got the right shape to produce the lensing. And so the next thing you need to do in your experiment is grab a napkin. I grabbed a piece of graph paper \u2014 I'm a physicist. (Laughter) So, a napkin. Draw a little model galaxy in the middle. And now put the lens over the galaxy, and what you'll find is that you'll see a ring, an Einstein ring. Now, move the base off to the side, and the ring will split up into arcs, OK. And you can put it on top of any image. On the graph paper, you can see how all the lines on the graph paper have been distorted. And again, this is a kind of an accurate model of what happens with the gravitational lensing.OK, so the question is: do we see this in the sky? Do we see arcs in the sky when we look at, say, a cluster of galaxies? And the answer is yes. And so, here's an image from the Hubble Space Telescope. Many of the images you are seeing are earlier from the Hubble Space Telescope. Well, first of all, for the golden shape galaxies \u2014 those are the galaxies in the cluster. They're the ones that are embedded in that sea of dark matter that are causing the bending of the light to cause these optical illusions, or mirages, practically, of the background galaxies. So the streaks that you see, all these streaks, are actually distorted images of galaxies that are much further away.So what we can do, then, is based on how much distortion we see in those images, we can calculate how much mass there must be in this cluster. And it's an enormous amount of mass. And also, you can tell by eye, by looking at this, that these arcs are not centered on individual galaxies. They are centered on some more spread out structure, and that is the dark matter in which the cluster is embedded, OK. So this is the closest you can get to kind of seeing at least the effects of the dark matter with your naked eye.OK, so, a quick review then, to see that you're following. So the evidence that we have that a quarter of the universe is dark matter \u2014 this gravitationally attracting stuff \u2014 is that galaxies, the speed with which stars orbiting galaxies is much too large; it must be embedded in dark matter. The speed with which galaxies within clusters are orbiting is much too large; it must be embedded in dark matter. And we see these gravitational lensing effects, these distortions that say that, again, clusters are embedded in dark matter.OK. So now, let's turn to dark energy. So to understand the evidence for dark energy, we need to discuss something that Stephen Hawking referred to in the previous session. And that is the fact that space itself is expanding. So if we imagine a section of our infinite universe \u2014 and so I've put down four spiral galaxies, OK \u2014 and imagine that you put down a set of tape measures, so every line on here corresponds to a tape measure, horizontal or vertical, for measuring where things are. If you could do this, what you would find that with each passing day, each passing year, each passing billions of years, OK, the distance between galaxies is getting greater. And it's not because galaxies are moving away from each other through space. They're not necessarily moving through space. They're moving away from each other because space itself is getting bigger, OK. That's what the expansion of the universe or space means. So they're moving further apart.Now, what Stephen Hawking mentioned, as well, is that after the Big Bang, space expanded at a very rapid rate. But because gravitationally attracting matter is embedded in this space, it tends to slow down the expansion of the space, OK. So the expansion slows down with time. So, in the last century, OK, people debated about whether this expansion of space would continue forever; whether it would slow down, you know, will be slowing down, but continue forever; slow down and stop, asymptotically stop; or slow down, stop, and then reverse, so it starts to contract again. So a little over a decade ago, two groups of physicists and astronomers set out to measure the rate at which the expansion of space was slowing down, OK. By how much less is it expanding today, compared to, say, a couple of billion years ago?The startling answer to this question, OK, from these experiments, was that space is expanding at a faster rate today than it was a few billion years ago, OK. So the expansion of space is actually speeding up. This was a completely surprising result. There is no persuasive theoretical argument for why this should happen, OK. No one was predicting ahead of time this is what's going to be found. It was the opposite of what was expected. So we need something to be able to explain that. Now it turns out, in the mathematics, you can put it in as a term that's an energy, but it's a completely different type of energy from anything we've ever seen before. We call it dark energy, and it has this effect of causing space to expand. But we don't have a good motivation for putting it in there at this point, OK. So it's really unexplained as to why we need to put it in.Now, so at this point, then, what I want to really emphasize to you, is that, first of all, dark matter and dark energy are completely different things, OK. There are really two mysteries out there as to what makes up most of the universe, and they have very different effects. Dark matter, because it gravitationally attracts, it tends to encourage the growth of structure, OK. So clusters of galaxies will tend to form, because of all this gravitational attraction. Dark energy, on the other hand, is putting more and more space between the galaxies, makes it, the gravitational attraction between them decrease, and so it impedes the growth of structure. So by looking at things like clusters of galaxies, and how they \u2014 their number density, how many there are as a function of time \u2014 we can learn about how dark matter and dark energy compete against each other in structure forming.In terms of dark matter, I said that we don't have any, you know, really persuasive argument for dark energy. Do we have anything for dark matter? And the answer is yes. We have well-motivated candidates for the dark matter. Now, what do I mean by well motivated? I mean that we have mathematically consistent theories that were actually introduced to explain a completely different phenomenon, OK, things that I haven't even talked about, that each predict the existence of a very weakly interacting, new particle.So, this is exactly what you want in physics: where a prediction comes out of a mathematically consistent theory that was actually developed for something else. But we don't know if either of those are actually the dark matter candidate, OK. One or both, who knows? Or it could be something completely different. Now, we look for these dark matter particles because, after all, they are here in the room, OK, and they didn't come in the door. They just pass through anything. They can come through the building, through the Earth \u2014 they're so non-interacting.So one way to look for them is to build detectors that are extremely sensitive to a dark matter particle coming through and bumping it. So a crystal that will ring if that happens. So one of my colleagues up the road and his collaborators have built such a detector. And they've put it deep down in an iron mine in Minnesota, OK, deep under the ground, and in fact, in the last couple of days announced the most sensitive results so far. They haven't seen anything, OK, but it puts limits on what the mass and the interaction strength of these dark matter particles are. There's going to be a satellite telescope launched later this year and it will look towards the middle of the galaxy, to see if we can see dark matter particles annihilating and producing gamma rays that could be detected with this. The Large Hadron Collider, a particle physics accelerator, that we'll be turning on later this year. It is possible that dark matter particles might be produced at the Large Hadron Collider.Now, because they are so non-interactive, they will actually escape the detector, so their signature will be missing energy, OK. Now, unfortunately, there is a lot of new physics whose signature could be missing energy, so it will be hard to tell the difference. And finally, for future endeavors, there are telescopes being designed specifically to address the questions of dark matter and dark energy \u2014 ground-based telescopes, and there are three space-based telescopes that are in competition right now to be launched to investigate dark matter and dark energy. So in terms of the big questions: what is dark matter? What is dark energy? The big questions facing physics. And I'm sure you have lots of questions, which I very much look forward to addressing over the next 72 hours, while I'm here. Thank you.

later, OK.\n\n00:01:41.958 --> 00:01:44.958\nSo for now, let's turn to the evidence for dark matter.\n\n00:01:44.958 --> 00:01:47.958\nIn these galaxies, especially in a spiral galaxy like this,\n\n00:01:47.958 --> 00:01:52.958\nmost of the mass of the stars is concentrated in the middle of the galaxy.\n\n00:01:52.958 --> 00:01:59.958\nThis huge mass of all these stars keeps stars in circular orbits in the galaxy.\n\n00:01:59.958 --> 00:02:02.958\nSo we have these stars going around in circles like this.\n\n00:02:02.958 --> 00:02:06.958\nAs you can imagine, even if you know physics, this should be intuitive, OK --\n\n00:02:06.958 --> 00:02:12.958\nthat stars that are closer to the mass in the middle will be rotating at a higher speed\n\n00:02:12.958 --> 00:02:15.958\nthan those that are further out here, OK.\n\n00:02:15.958 --> 00:02:20.958\nSo what you would expect is that if you measured the orbital speed of the stars,\n\n00:02:20.958 --> 00:02:24.958\nthat they should be slower on the edges than on the inside.\n\n00:02:24.958 --> 00:02:26.958\nIn other words, if we measured speed as a function of distance --\n\n00:02:26.958 --> 00:02:28.958\nthis is the only time I'm going to show a graph, OK --\n\n00:02:28.958 --> 00:02:32.958\nwe would expect that it goes down as the distance increases\n\n00:02:32.958 --> 00:02:34.958\nfrom the center of the galaxy.\n\n00:02:34.958 --> 00:02:35.958\nWhen those measurements are made,\n\n00:02:35.958 --> 00:02:38.958\ninstead what we find is that the speed is basically constant,\n\n00:02:38.958 --> 00:02:40.958\nas a function of distance.\n\n00:02:40.958 --> 00:02:43.958\nIf it's constant, that means that the stars out here\n\n00:02:43.958 --> 00:02:47.958\nare feeling the gravitational effects of matter that we do not see.\n\n00:02:47.958 --> 00:02:50.958\nIn fact, this galaxy and every other galaxy\n\n00:02:50.958 --> 00:02:55.958\nappears to be embedded in a cloud of this invisible dark matter.\n\n00:02:55.958 --> 00:02:59.958\nAnd this cloud of matter is much more spherical than the galaxy themselves,\n\n00:02:59.958 --> 00:03:03.958\nand it extends over a much wider range than the galaxy.\n\n00:03:03.958 --> 00:03:07.958\nSo we see the galaxy and fixate on that, but it's actually a cloud of dark matter\n\n00:03:07.958 --> 00:03:12.958\nthat's dominating the structure and the dynamics of this galaxy.\n\n00:03:12.958 --> 00:03:15.958\nGalaxies themselves are not strewn randomly in space;\n\n00:03:15.958 --> 00:03:17.958\nthey tend to cluster.\n\n00:03:17.958 --> 00:03:20.958\nAnd this is an example of a very, actually, famous cluster, the Coma cluster.\n\n00:03:20.958 --> 00:03:23.958\nAnd there are thousands of galaxies in this cluster.\n\n00:03:23.958 --> 00:03:26.958\nThey're the white, fuzzy, elliptical things here.\n\n00:03:26.958 --> 00:03:29.958\nSo these galaxy clusters -- we take a snapshot now,\n\n00:03:29.958 --> 00:03:32.958\nwe take a snapshot in a decade, it'll look identical.\n\n00:03:32.958 --> 00:03:36.958\nBut these galaxies are actually moving at extremely high speeds.\n\n00:03:36.958 --> 00:03:41.958\nThey're moving around in this gravitational potential well of this cluster, OK.\n\n00:03:41.958 --> 00:03:43.958\nSo all of these galaxies are moving.\n\n00:03:43.958 --> 00:03:47.958\nWe can measure the speeds of these galaxies, their orbital velocities,\n\n00:03:47.958 --> 00:03:49.958\nand figure out how much mass is in this cluster.\n\n00:03:49.958 --> 00:03:53.958\nAnd again, what we find is that there is much more mass there\n\n00:03:53.958 --> 00:03:57.958\nthan can be accounted for by the galaxies that we see.\n\n00:03:57.958 --> 00:03:59.958\nOr if we look in other parts of the electromagnetic spectrum,\n\n00:03:59.958 --> 00:04:02.958\nwe see that there's a lot of gas in this cluster, as well.\n\n00:04:02.958 --> 00:04:04.958\nBut that cannot account for the mass either.\n\n00:04:04.958 --> 00:04:07.958\nIn fact, there appears to be about ten times as much mass here\n\n00:04:07.958 --> 00:04:10.958\nin the form of this invisible or dark matter\n\n00:04:10.958 --> 00:04:14.958\nas there is in the ordinary matter, OK.\n\n00:04:14.958 --> 00:04:18.958\nIt would be nice if we could see this dark matter a little bit more directly.\n\n00:04:18.958 --> 00:04:20.958\nI'm just putting this big, blue blob on there, OK,\n\n00:04:20.958 --> 00:04:22.958\nto try to remind you that it's there.\n\n00:04:22.958 --> 00:04:25.958\nCan we see it more visually? Yes, we can.\n\n00:04:25.958 --> 00:04:27.958\nAnd so let me lead you through how we can do this.\n\n00:04:27.958 --> 00:04:29.958\nSo here's an observer:\n\n00:04:29.958 --> 00:04:31.958\nit could be an eye; it could be a telescope.\n\n00:04:31.958 --> 00:04:33.958\nAnd suppose there's a galaxy out here in the universe.\n\n00:04:33.958 --> 00:04:35.958\nHow do we see that galaxy?\n\n00:04:35.958 --> 00:04:38.958\nA ray of light leaves the galaxy and travels through the universe\n\n00:04:38.958 --> 00:04:40.958\nfor perhaps billions of years\n\n00:04:40.958 --> 00:04:43.958\nbefore it enters the telescope or your eye.\n\n00:04:43.958 --> 00:04:46.958\nNow, how do we deduce where the galaxy is?\n\n00:04:46.958 --> 00:04:49.958\nWell, we deduce it by the direction that the ray is traveling\n\n00:04:49.958 --> 00:04:51.958\nas it enters our eye, right?\n\n00:04:51.958 --> 00:04:53.958\nWe say, the ray of light came this way;\n\n00:04:53.958 --> 00:04:55.958\nthe galaxy must be there, OK.\n\n00:04:55.958 --> 00:04:59.958\nNow, suppose I put in the middle a cluster of galaxies --\n\n00:04:59.958 --> 00:05:01.958\nand don't forget the dark matter, OK.\n\n00:05:01.958 --> 00:05:05.958\nNow, if we consider a different ray of light, one going off like this,\n\n00:05:05.958 --> 00:05:07.958\nwe now need to take into account\n\n00:05:07.958 --> 00:05:10.958\nwhat Einstein predicted when he developed general relativity.\n\n00:05:10.958 --> 00:05:14.958\nAnd that was that the gravitational field, due to mass,\n\n00:05:14.958 --> 00:05:17.958\nwill deflect not only the trajectory of particles,\n\n00:05:17.958 --> 00:05:20.958\nbut will deflect light itself.\n\n00:05:20.958 --> 00:05:23.958\nSo this light ray will not continue in a straight line,\n\n00:05:23.958 --> 00:05:27.958\nbut would rather bend and could end up going into our eye.\n\n00:05:27.958 --> 00:05:30.958\nWhere will this observer see the galaxy?\n\n00:05:30.958 --> 00:05:34.958\nYou can respond. Up, right?\n\n00:05:34.958 --> 00:05:37.958\nWe extrapolate backwards and say the galaxy is up here.\n\n00:05:37.958 --> 00:05:38.958\nIs there any other ray of light\n\n00:05:38.958 --> 00:05:41.958\nthat could make into the observer's eye from that galaxy?\n\n00:05:41.958 --> 00:05:44.958\nYes, great. I see people going down like this.\n\n00:05:44.958 --> 00:05:46.958\nSo a ray of light could go down, be bent\n\n00:05:46.958 --> 00:05:48.958\nup into the observer's eye,\n\n00:05:48.958 --> 00:05:50.958\nand the observer sees a ray of light here.\n\n00:05:50.958 --> 00:05:52.958\nNow, take into account the fact that we live in\n\n00:05:52.958 --> 00:05:54.958\na three-dimensional universe, OK,\n\n00:05:54.958 --> 00:05:56.958\na three-dimensional space.\n\n00:05:56.958 --> 00:05:59.958\nAre there any other rays of light that could make it into the eye?\n\n00:05:59.958 --> 00:06:05.958\nYes! The rays would lie on a -- I'd like to see -- yeah, on a cone.\n\n00:06:05.958 --> 00:06:07.958\nSo there's a whole ray of light -- rays of light on a cone --\n\n00:06:07.958 --> 00:06:09.958\nthat will all be bent by that cluster\n\n00:06:09.958 --> 00:06:12.958\nand make it into the observer's eye.\n\n00:06:12.958 --> 00:06:17.958\nIf there is a cone of light coming into my eye, what do I see?\n\n00:06:17.958 --> 00:06:21.958\nA circle, a ring. It's called an Einstein ring. Einstein predicted that, OK.\n\n00:06:21.958 --> 00:06:26.958\nNow, it will only be a perfect ring if the source, the deflector\n\n00:06:26.958 --> 00:06:31.958\nand the eyeball, in this case, are all in a perfectly straight line.\n\n00:06:31.958 --> 00:06:34.958\nIf they're slightly skewed, we'll see a different image.\n\n00:06:34.958 --> 00:06:37.958\nNow, you can do an experiment tonight over the reception, OK,\n\n00:06:37.958 --> 00:06:40.958\nto figure out what that image will look like.\n\n00:06:40.958 --> 00:06:44.958\nBecause it turns out that there is a kind of lens that we can devise,\n\n00:06:44.958 --> 00:06:47.958\nthat has the right shape to produce this kind of effect.\n\n00:06:47.958 --> 00:06:49.958\nWe call this gravitational lensing.\n\n00:06:49.958 --> 00:06:52.958\nAnd so, this is your instrument, OK.\n\n00:06:52.958 --> 00:06:53.958\n(Laughter).\n\n00:06:53.958 --> 00:06:56.958\nBut ignore the top part.\n\n00:06:56.958 --> 00:06:59.958\nIt's the base that I want you to concentrate, OK.\n\n00:06:59.958 --> 00:07:01.958\nSo, actually, at home, whenever we break a wineglass,\n\n00:07:01.958 --> 00:07:03.958\nI save the bottom, take it over to the machine shop.\n\n00:07:03.958 --> 00:07:07.958\nWe shave it off, and I have a little gravitational lens, OK.\n\n00:07:07.958 --> 00:07:09.958\nSo it's got the right shape to produce the lensing.\n\n00:07:09.958 --> 00:07:11.958\nAnd so the next thing you need to do in your experiment\n\n00:07:11.958 --> 00:07:15.958\nis grab a napkin. I grabbed a piece of graph paper -- I'm a physicist. (Laughter)\n\n00:07:15.958 --> 00:07:19.958\nSo, a napkin. Draw a little model galaxy in the middle.\n\n00:07:19.958 --> 00:07:22.958\nAnd now put the lens over the galaxy,\n\n00:07:22.958 --> 00:07:25.958\nand what you'll find is that you'll see a ring, an Einstein ring.\n\n00:07:25.958 --> 00:07:28.958\nNow, move the base off to the side,\n\n00:07:28.958 --> 00:07:31.958\nand the ring will split up into arcs, OK.\n\n00:07:31.958 --> 00:07:33.958\nAnd you can put it on top of any image.\n\n00:07:33.958 --> 00:07:34.958\nOn the graph paper, you can see\n\n00:07:34.958 --> 00:07:36.958\nhow all the lines on the graph paper have been distorted.\n\n00:07:36.958 --> 00:07:39.958\nAnd again, this is a kind of an accurate model\n\n00:07:39.958 --> 00:07:41.958\nof what happens with the gravitational lensing.\n\n00:07:41.958 --> 00:07:45.958\nOK, so the question is: do we see this in the sky?\n\n00:07:45.958 --> 00:07:49.958\nDo we see arcs in the sky when we look at, say, a cluster of galaxies?\n\n00:07:49.958 --> 00:07:51.958\nAnd the answer is yes.\n\n00:07:51.958 --> 00:07:53.958\nAnd so, here's an image from the Hubble Space Telescope.\n\n00:07:53.958 --> 00:07:55.958\nMany of the images you are seeing\n\n00:07:55.958 --> 00:07:57.958\nare earlier from the Hubble Space Telescope.\n\n00:07:57.958 --> 00:07:59.958\nWell, first of all, for the golden shape galaxies --\n\n00:07:59.958 --> 00:08:02.958\nthose are the galaxies in the cluster.\n\n00:08:02.958 --> 00:08:06.958\nThey're the ones that are embedded in that sea of dark matter\n\n00:08:06.958 --> 00:08:08.958\nthat are causing the bending of the light\n\n00:08:08.958 --> 00:08:11.958\nto cause these optical illusions, or mirages, practically,\n\n00:08:11.958 --> 00:08:13.958\nof the background galaxies.\n\n00:08:13.958 --> 00:08:16.958\nSo the streaks that you see, all these streaks,\n\n00:08:16.958 --> 00:08:20.958\nare actually distorted images of galaxies that are much further away.\n\n00:08:20.958 --> 00:08:23.958\nSo what we can do, then, is based on how much distortion\n\n00:08:23.958 --> 00:08:27.958\nwe see in those images, we can calculate how much mass\n\n00:08:27.958 --> 00:08:29.958\nthere must be in this cluster.\n\n00:08:29.958 --> 00:08:31.958\nAnd it's an enormous amount of mass.\n\n00:08:31.958 --> 00:08:33.958\nAnd also, you can tell by eye, by looking at this,\n\n00:08:33.958 --> 00:08:37.958\nthat these arcs are not centered on individual galaxies.\n\n00:08:37.958 --> 00:08:41.958\nThey are centered on some more spread out structure,\n\n00:08:41.958 --> 00:08:45.958\nand that is the dark matter\n\n00:08:45.958 --> 00:08:48.958\nin which the cluster is embedded, OK.\n\n00:08:48.958 --> 00:08:50.958\nSo this is the closest you can get to kind of seeing\n\n00:08:50.958 --> 00:08:53.958\nat least the effects of the dark matter with your naked eye.\n\n00:08:53.958 --> 00:08:56.958\nOK, so, a quick review then, to see that you're following.\n\n00:08:56.958 --> 00:08:58.958\nSo the evidence that we have\n\n00:08:58.958 --> 00:09:00.958\nthat a quarter of the universe is dark matter --\n\n00:09:00.958 --> 00:09:02.958\nthis gravitationally attracting stuff --\n\n00:09:02.958 --> 00:09:06.958\nis that galaxies, the speed with which stars orbiting galaxies\n\n00:09:06.958 --> 00:09:09.958\nis much too large; it must be embedded in dark matter.\n\n00:09:09.958 --> 00:09:13.958\nThe speed with which galaxies within clusters are orbiting is much too large;\n\n00:09:13.958 --> 00:09:15.958\nit must be embedded in dark matter.\n\n00:09:15.958 --> 00:09:19.958\nAnd we see these gravitational lensing effects, these distortions\n\n00:09:19.958 --> 00:09:22.958\nthat say that, again, clusters are embedded in dark matter.\n\n00:09:22.958 --> 00:09:26.958\nOK. So now, let's turn to dark energy.\n\n00:09:26.958 --> 00:09:29.958\nSo to understand the evidence for dark energy, we need to discuss something\n\n00:09:29.958 --> 00:09:33.958\nthat Stephen Hawking referred to in the previous session.\n\n00:09:33.958 --> 00:09:37.958\nAnd that is the fact that space itself is expanding.\n\n00:09:37.958 --> 00:09:42.958\nSo if we imagine a section of our infinite universe --\n\n00:09:42.958 --> 00:09:45.958\nand so I've put down four spiral galaxies, OK --\n\n00:09:45.958 --> 00:09:49.958\nand imagine that you put down a set of tape measures,\n\n00:09:49.958 --> 00:09:51.958\nso every line on here corresponds to a tape measure,\n\n00:09:51.958 --> 00:09:55.958\nhorizontal or vertical, for measuring where things are.\n\n00:09:55.958 --> 00:09:57.958\nIf you could do this, what you would find\n\n00:09:57.958 --> 00:10:00.958\nthat with each passing day, each passing year,\n\n00:10:00.958 --> 00:10:03.958\neach passing billions of years, OK,\n\n00:10:03.958 --> 00:10:06.958\nthe distance between galaxies is getting greater.\n\n00:10:06.958 --> 00:10:07.958\nAnd it's not because galaxies are moving\n\n00:10:07.958 --> 00:10:10.958\naway from each other through space.\n\n00:10:10.958 --> 00:10:12.958\nThey're not necessarily moving through space.\n\n00:10:12.958 --> 00:10:14.958\nThey're moving away from each other\n\n00:10:14.958 --> 00:10:17.958\nbecause space itself is getting bigger, OK.\n\n00:10:17.958 --> 00:10:21.958\nThat's what the expansion of the universe or space means.\n\n00:10:21.958 --> 00:10:23.958\nSo they're moving further apart.\n\n00:10:23.958 --> 00:10:27.958\nNow, what Stephen Hawking mentioned, as well,\n\n00:10:27.958 --> 00:10:33.958\nis that after the Big Bang, space expanded at a very rapid rate.\n\n00:10:33.958 --> 00:10:37.958\nBut because gravitationally attracting matter\n\n00:10:37.958 --> 00:10:39.958\nis embedded in this space,\n\n00:10:39.958 --> 00:10:42.958\nit tends to slow down the expansion of the space, OK.\n\n00:10:42.958 --> 00:10:45.958\nSo the expansion slows down with time.\n\n00:10:45.958 --> 00:10:49.958\nSo, in the last century, OK, people debated\n\n00:10:49.958 --> 00:10:54.958\nabout whether this expansion of space would continue forever;\n\n00:10:54.958 --> 00:10:56.958\nwhether it would slow down, you know,\n\n00:10:56.958 --> 00:10:58.958\nwill be slowing down, but continue forever;\n\n00:10:58.958 --> 00:11:03.958\nslow down and stop, asymptotically stop;\n\n00:11:03.958 --> 00:11:08.958\nor slow down, stop, and then reverse, so it starts to contract again.\n\n00:11:08.958 --> 00:11:10.958\nSo a little over a decade ago,\n\n00:11:10.958 --> 00:11:15.958\ntwo groups of physicists and astronomers\n\n00:11:15.958 --> 00:11:17.958\nset out to measure the rate at which\n\n00:11:17.958 --> 00:11:21.958\nthe expansion of space was slowing down, OK.\n\n00:11:21.958 --> 00:11:23.958\nBy how much less is it expanding today,\n\n00:11:23.958 --> 00:11:26.958\ncompared to, say, a couple of billion years ago?\n\n00:11:26.958 --> 00:11:31.958\nThe startling answer to this question, OK, from these experiments,\n\n00:11:31.958 --> 00:11:35.958\nwas that space is expanding at a faster rate today\n\n00:11:35.958 --> 00:11:38.958\nthan it was a few billion years ago, OK.\n\n00:11:38.958 --> 00:11:41.958\nSo the expansion of space is actually speeding up.\n\n00:11:41.958 --> 00:11:44.958\nThis was a completely surprising result.\n\n00:11:44.958 --> 00:11:50.958\nThere is no persuasive theoretical argument for why this should happen, OK.\n\n00:11:50.958 --> 00:11:53.958\nNo one was predicting ahead of time this is what's going to be found.\n\n00:11:53.958 --> 00:11:55.958\nIt was the opposite of what was expected.\n\n00:11:55.958 --> 00:11:58.958\nSo we need something to be able to explain that.\n\n00:11:58.958 --> 00:12:00.958\nNow it turns out, in the mathematics,\n\n00:12:00.958 --> 00:12:04.958\nyou can put it in as a term that's an energy,\n\n00:12:04.958 --> 00:12:05.958\nbut it's a completely different type of energy\n\n00:12:05.958 --> 00:12:07.958\nfrom anything we've ever seen before.\n\n00:12:07.958 --> 00:12:09.958\nWe call it dark energy,\n\n00:12:09.958 --> 00:12:12.958\nand it has this effect of causing space to expand.\n\n00:12:12.958 --> 00:12:14.958\nBut we don't have a good motivation\n\n00:12:14.958 --> 00:12:16.958\nfor putting it in there at this point, OK.\n\n00:12:16.958 --> 00:12:19.958\nSo it's really unexplained as to why we need to put it in.\n\n00:12:19.958 --> 00:12:23.958\nNow, so at this point, then, what I want to really emphasize to you,\n\n00:12:23.958 --> 00:12:25.958\nis that, first of all, dark matter and dark energy\n\n00:12:25.958 --> 00:12:27.958\nare completely different things, OK.\n\n00:12:27.958 --> 00:12:31.958\nThere are really two mysteries out there as to what makes up most of the universe,\n\n00:12:31.958 --> 00:12:34.958\nand they have very different effects.\n\n00:12:34.958 --> 00:12:37.958\nDark matter, because it gravitationally attracts,\n\n00:12:37.958 --> 00:12:41.958\nit tends to encourage the growth of structure, OK.\n\n00:12:41.958 --> 00:12:44.958\nSo clusters of galaxies will tend to form,\n\n00:12:44.958 --> 00:12:46.958\nbecause of all this gravitational attraction.\n\n00:12:46.958 --> 00:12:48.958\nDark energy, on the other hand,\n\n00:12:48.958 --> 00:12:52.958\nis putting more and more space between the galaxies,\n\n00:12:52.958 --> 00:12:55.958\nmakes it, the gravitational attraction between them decrease,\n\n00:12:55.958 --> 00:12:58.958\nand so it impedes the growth of structure.\n\n00:12:58.958 --> 00:13:01.958\nSo by looking at things like clusters of galaxies,\n\n00:13:01.958 --> 00:13:05.958\nand how they -- their number density,\n\n00:13:05.958 --> 00:13:07.958\nhow many there are as a function of time --\n\n00:13:07.958 --> 00:13:11.958\nwe can learn about how dark matter and dark energy\n\n00:13:11.958 --> 00:13:14.958\ncompete against each other in structure forming.\n\n00:13:14.958 --> 00:13:17.958\nIn terms of dark matter, I said that we don't have any,\n\n00:13:17.958 --> 00:13:21.958\nyou know, really persuasive argument for dark energy.\n\n00:13:21.958 --> 00:13:24.958\nDo we have anything for dark matter? And the answer is yes.\n\n00:13:24.958 --> 00:13:27.958\nWe have well-motivated candidates for the dark matter.\n\n00:13:27.958 --> 00:13:30.958\nNow, what do I mean by well motivated?\n\n00:13:30.958 --> 00:13:35.958\nI mean that we have mathematically consistent theories\n\n00:13:35.958 --> 00:13:37.958\nthat were actually introduced\n\n00:13:37.958 --> 00:13:40.958\nto explain a completely different phenomenon, OK,\n\n00:13:40.958 --> 00:13:42.958\nthings that I haven't even talked about,\n\n00:13:42.958 --> 00:13:45.958\nthat each predict the existence\n\n00:13:45.958 --> 00:13:48.958\nof a very weakly interacting, new particle.\n\n00:13:48.958 --> 00:13:50.958\nSo, this is exactly what you want in physics:\n\n00:13:50.958 --> 00:13:54.958\nwhere a prediction comes out of a mathematically consistent theory\n\n00:13:54.958 --> 00:13:56.958\nthat was actually developed for something else.\n\n00:13:56.958 --> 00:13:59.958\nBut we don't know if either of those\n\n00:13:59.958 --> 00:14:02.958\nare actually the dark matter candidate, OK.\n\n00:14:02.958 --> 00:14:05.958\nOne or both, who knows? Or it could be something completely different.\n\n00:14:05.958 --> 00:14:07.958\nNow, we look for these dark matter particles\n\n00:14:07.958 --> 00:14:10.958\nbecause, after all, they are here in the room, OK,\n\n00:14:10.958 --> 00:14:11.958\nand they didn't come in the door.\n\n00:14:11.958 --> 00:14:13.958\nThey just pass through anything.\n\n00:14:13.958 --> 00:14:15.958\nThey can come through the building, through the Earth --\n\n00:14:15.958 --> 00:14:17.958\nthey're so non-interacting.\n\n00:14:17.958 --> 00:14:20.958\nSo one way to look for them is to build detectors\n\n00:14:20.958 --> 00:14:24.958\nthat are extremely sensitive to a dark matter particle coming through and bumping it.\n\n00:14:24.958 --> 00:14:27.958\nSo a crystal that will ring if that happens.\n\n00:14:27.958 --> 00:14:29.958\nSo one of my colleagues up the road and his collaborators\n\n00:14:29.958 --> 00:14:31.958\nhave built such a detector.\n\n00:14:31.958 --> 00:14:34.958\nAnd they've put it deep down in an iron mine in Minnesota,\n\n00:14:34.958 --> 00:14:37.958\nOK, deep under the ground, and in fact, in the last couple of days\n\n00:14:37.958 --> 00:14:40.958\nannounced the most sensitive results so far.\n\n00:14:40.958 --> 00:14:43.958\nThey haven't seen anything, OK, but it puts limits on what the mass\n\n00:14:43.958 --> 00:14:46.958\nand the interaction strength of these dark matter particles are.\n\n00:14:46.958 --> 00:14:50.958\nThere's going to be a satellite telescope launched later this year\n\n00:14:50.958 --> 00:14:53.958\nand it will look towards the middle of the galaxy,\n\n00:14:53.958 --> 00:14:55.958\nto see if we can see dark matter particles annihilating\n\n00:14:55.958 --> 00:14:59.958\nand producing gamma rays that could be detected with this.\n\n00:14:59.958 --> 00:15:02.958\nThe Large Hadron Collider, a particle physics accelerator,\n\n00:15:02.958 --> 00:15:05.958\nthat we'll be turning on later this year.\n\n00:15:05.958 --> 00:15:08.958\nIt is possible that dark matter particles might be produced\n\n00:15:08.958 --> 00:15:10.958\nat the Large Hadron Collider.\n\n00:15:10.958 --> 00:15:11.958\nNow, because they are so non-interactive,\n\n00:15:11.958 --> 00:15:14.958\nthey will actually escape the detector,\n\n00:15:14.958 --> 00:15:17.958\nso their signature will be missing energy, OK.\n\n00:15:17.958 --> 00:15:20.958\nNow, unfortunately, there is a lot of new physics\n\n00:15:20.958 --> 00:15:22.958\nwhose signature could be missing energy,\n\n00:15:22.958 --> 00:15:24.958\nso it will be hard to tell the difference.\n\n00:15:24.958 --> 00:15:29.958\nAnd finally, for future endeavors, there are telescopes being designed\n\n00:15:29.958 --> 00:15:33.958\nspecifically to address the questions of dark matter and dark energy --\n\n00:15:33.958 --> 00:15:36.958\nground-based telescopes, and there are three space-based telescopes\n\n00:15:36.958 --> 00:15:38.958\nthat are in competition right now\n\n00:15:38.958 --> 00:15:41.958\nto be launched to investigate dark matter and dark energy.\n\n00:15:41.958 --> 00:15:43.958\nSo in terms of the big questions:\n\n00:15:43.958 --> 00:15:45.958\nwhat is dark matter? What is dark energy?\n\n00:15:45.958 --> 00:15:47.958\nThe big questions facing physics.\n\n00:15:47.958 --> 00:15:50.958\nAnd I'm sure you have lots of questions,\n\n00:15:50.958 --> 00:15:52.958\nwhich I very much look forward to addressing\n\n00:15:52.958 --> 00:15:54.958\nover the next 72 hours, while I'm here. Thank you.\n\n00:15:54.958 --> 00:15:57.958\n(Applause)"}, {"title": "A family tree for humanity", "duration": "1253", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/spencer_wells_is_building_a_family_tree_for_all_humanity", "transcript": "Jambo, bonjour, zdravstvujtye, dayo: these are a few of the languages that I've spoken little bits of over the course of the last six weeks, as I've been to 17 countries I think I'm up to, on this crazy tour I've been doing, checking out various aspects of the project that we're doing. And I'm going to tell you a little bit about later on. And visiting some pretty incredible places, places like Mongolia, Cambodia, New Guinea, South Africa, Tanzania twice \u2014 I was here a month ago.And the opportunity to make a whirlwind tour of the world like that is utterly amazing, for lots of reasons. You see some incredible stuff. And you get to make these spot comparisons between people all around the globe. And the thing that you really take away from that, the kind of surface thing that you take away from it, is not that we're all one, although I'm going to tell you about that, but rather how different we are. There is so much diversity around the globe. 6,000 different languages spoken by six and a half billion people, all different colors, shapes, sizes. You walk down the street in any big city, you travel like that, and you are amazed at the diversity in the human species.How do we explain that diversity? Well, that's what I'm going to talk about today, is how we're using the tools of genetics, population genetics in particular, to tell us how we generated this diversity, and how long it took. Now, the problem of human diversity, like all big scientific questions \u2014 how do you explain something like that \u2014 can be broken down into sub-questions. And you can ferret away at those little sub-questions.First one is really a question of origins. Do we all share a common origin, in fact? And given that we do \u2014 and that's the assumption everybody, I think, in this room would make \u2014 when was that? When did we originate as a species? How long have we been divergent from each other?And the second question is related, but slightly different. If we do spring from a common source, how did we come to occupy every corner of the globe, and in the process generate all of this diversity, the different ways of life, the different appearances, the different languages around the world?Well, the question of origins, as with so many other questions in biology, seems to have been answered by Darwin over a century ago. In \"The Descent of Man,\" he wrote, \"In each great region of the world, the living mammals are closely related to the extinct species of the same region. It's therefore probable that Africa was formerly inhabited by extinct apes closely allied to the gorilla and chimpanzee, and as these two species are now man's nearest allies, it's somewhat more probable that our early progenitors lived on the African continent than elsewhere.\"So we're done, we can go home \u2014 finished the origin question. Well, not quite. Because Darwin was talking about our distant ancestry, our common ancestry with apes. And it is quite clear that apes originated on the African continent. Around 23 million years ago, they appear in the fossil record. Africa was actually disconnected from the other landmasses at that time, due to the vagaries of plate tectonics, floating around the Indian Ocean. Bumped into Eurasia around 16 million years ago, and then we had the first African exodus, as we call it. The apes that left at that time ended up in Southeast Asia, became the gibbons and the orangutans. And the ones that stayed on in Africa evolved into the gorillas, the chimpanzees and us. So, yes, if you're talking about our common ancestry with apes, it's very clear, by looking at the fossil record, we started off here.But that's not really the question I'm asking. I'm asking about our human ancestry, things that we would recognize as being like us if they were sitting here in the room. If they were peering over your shoulder, you wouldn't leap back, like that. What about our human ancestry? Because if we go far enough back, we share a common ancestry with every living thing on Earth. DNA ties us all together, so we share ancestry with barracuda and bacteria and mushrooms, if you go far enough back \u2014 over a billion years. What we're asking about though is human ancestry. How do we study that?Well, historically, it has been studied using the science of paleoanthropology. Digging things up out of the ground, and largely on the basis of morphology \u2014 the way things are shaped, often skull shape \u2014 saying, \"This looks a little bit more like us than that, so this must be my ancestor. This must be who I'm directly descended from.\"The field of paleoanthropology, I'll argue, gives us lots of fascinating possibilities about our ancestry, but it doesn't give us the probabilities that we really want as scientists. What do I mean by that? You're looking at a great example here. These are three extinct species of hominids, potential human ancestors. All dug up just west of here in Olduvai Gorge, by the Leakey family. And they're all dating to roughly the same time. From left to right, we've got Homo erectus, Homo habilis, and Australopithecus \u2014 now called Paranthropus boisei, the robust australopithecine. Three extinct species, same place, same time. That means that not all three could be my direct ancestor. Which one of these guys am I actually related to? Possibilities about our ancestry, but not the probabilities that we're really looking for.Well, a different approach has been to look at morphology in humans using the only data that people really had at hand until quite recently \u2014 again, largely skull shape. The first person to do this systematically was Linnaeus, Carl von Linne, a Swedish botanist, who in the eighteenth century took it upon himself to categorize every living organism on the planet. You think you've got a tough job? And he did a pretty good job. He categorized about 12,000 species in \"Systema Naturae.\" He actually coined the term Homo sapiens \u2014 it means wise man in Latin. But looking around the world at the diversity of humans, he said, \"Well, you know, we seem to come in discreet sub-species or categories.\" And he talked about Africans and Americans and Asians and Europeans, and a blatantly racist category he termed \"Monstrosus,\" which basically included all the people he didn't like, including imaginary folk like elves.It's easy to dismiss this as the perhaps well-intentioned but ultimately benighted musings of an eighteenth century scientist working in the pre-Darwinian era. Except, if you had taken physical anthropology as recently as 20 or 30 years ago, in many cases you would have learned basically that same classification of humanity. Human races that according to physical anthropologists of 30, 40 years ago \u2014 Carlton Coon is the best example \u2014 had been diverging from each other \u2014 this was in the post-Darwinian era \u2014 for over a million years, since the time of Homo erectus. But based on what data? Very little. Very little. Morphology and a lot of guesswork.Well, what I'm going to talk about today, what I'm going to talk about now is a new approach to this problem. Instead of going out and guessing about our ancestry, digging things up out of the ground, possible ancestors, and saying it on the basis of morphology \u2014 which we still don't completely understand, we don't know the genetic causes underlying this morphological variation \u2014what we need to do is turn the problem on its head. Because what we're really asking is a genealogical problem, or a genealogical question. What we're trying to do is construct a family tree for everybody alive today. And as any genealogist will tell you \u2014 anybody have a member of the family, or maybe you have tried to construct a family tree, trace back in time? You start in the present, with relationships you're certain about. You and your siblings, you have a parent in common. You and your cousins share a grandparent in common. You gradually trace further and further back into the past, adding these ever more distant relationships. But eventually, no matter how good you are at digging up the church records, and all that stuff, you hit what the genealogists call a brick wall. A point beyond which you don't know anything else about your ancestors, and you enter this dark and mysterious realm we call history that we have to feel our way through with whispered guidance.Who were these people who came before? We have no written record. Well, actually, we do. Written in our DNA, in our genetic code \u2014 we have a historical document that takes us back in time to the very earliest days of our species. And that's what we study.Now, a quick primer on DNA. I suspect that not everybody in the audience is a geneticist. It is a very long, linear molecule, a coded version of how to make another copy of you. It's your blueprint. It's composed of four subunits: A, C, G and T, we call them. And it's the sequence of those subunits that defines that blueprint. How long is it? Well, it's billions of these subunits in length. A haploid genome \u2014 we actually have two copies of all of our chromosomes \u2014 a haploid genome is around 3.2 billion nucleotides in length. And the whole thing, if you add it all together, is over six billion nucleotides long. If you take all the DNA out of one cell in your body, and stretch it end to end, it's around two meters long. If you take all the DNA out of every cell in your body, and you stretch it end to end, it would reach from here to the moon and back, thousands of times. It's a lot of information.And so when you're copying this DNA molecule to pass it on, it's a pretty tough job. Imagine the longest book you can think of, \"War and Peace.\" Now multiply it by 100. And imagine copying that by hand. And you're working away until late at night, and you're very, very careful, and you're drinking coffee and you're paying attention, but, occasionally, when you're copying this by hand, you're going to make a little typo, a spelling mistake \u2014 substitute an I for an E, or a C for a T.Same thing happens to our DNA as it's being passed on through the generations. It doesn't happen very often. We have a proofreading mechanism built in. But when it does happen, and these changes get transmitted down through the generations, they become markers of descent. If you share a marker with someone, it means you share an ancestor at some point in the past, the person who first had that change in their DNA. And it's by looking at the pattern of genetic variation, the pattern of these markers in people all over the world, and assessing the relative ages when they occurred throughout our history, that we've been able to construct a family tree for everybody alive today.These are two pieces of DNA that we use quite widely in our work. Mitochondrial DNA, tracing a purely maternal line of descent. You get your mtDNA from your mother, and your mother's mother, all the way back to the very first woman. The Y chromosome, the piece of DNA that makes men men, traces a purely paternal line of descent. Everybody in this room, everybody in the world, falls into a lineage somewhere on these trees. Now, even though these are simplified versions of the real trees, they're still kind of complicated, so let's simplify them. Turn them on their sides, combine them so that they look like a tree with the root at the bottom and the branches going up. What's the take-home message?Well, the thing that jumps out at you first is that the deepest lineages in our family trees are found within Africa, among Africans. That means that Africans have been accumulating this mutational diversity for longer. And what that means is that we originated in Africa. It's written in our DNA. Every piece of DNA we look at has greater diversity within Africa than outside of Africa. And at some point in the past, a sub-group of Africans left the African continent to go out and populate the rest of the world.Now, how recently do we share this ancestry? Was it millions of years ago, which we might suspect by looking at all this incredible variation around the world? No, the DNA tells a story that's very clear. Within the last 200,000 years, we all share an ancestor, a single person \u2014 Mitochondrial Eve, you might have heard about her \u2014 in Africa, an African woman who gave rise to all the mitochondrial diversity in the world today.But what's even more amazing is that if you look at the Y-chromosome side, the male side of the story, the Y-chromosome Adam only lived around 60,000 years ago. That's only about 2,000 human generations, the blink of an eye in an evolutionary sense. That tells us we were all still living in Africa at that time. This was an African man who gave rise to all the Y chromosome diversity around the world. It's only within the last 60,000 years that we have started to generate this incredible diversity we see around the world. Such an amazing story. We're all effectively part of an extended African family.Now, that seems so recent. Why didn't we start to leave earlier? Why didn't Homo erectus evolve into separate species, or sub-species rather, human races around the world? Why was it that we seem to have come out of Africa so recently? Well, that's a big question. These \"why\" questions, particularly in genetics and the study of history in general, are always the big ones, the ones that are tough to answer.And so when all else fails, talk about the weather. What was going on to the world's weather around 60,000 years ago? Well, we were going into the worst part of the last ice age. The last ice age started roughly 120,000 years ago. It went up and down, and it really started to accelerate around 70,000 years ago. Lots of evidence from sediment cores and the pollen types, oxygen isotopes and so on. We hit the last glacial maximum around 16,000 years ago, but basically, from 70,000 years on, things were getting really tough, getting very cold. The Northern Hemisphere had massive growing ice sheets. New York City, Chicago, Seattle, all under a sheet of ice. Most of Britain, all of Scandinavia, covered by ice several kilometers thick.Now, Africa is the most tropical continent on the planet \u2014 about 85 percent of it lies between Cancer and Capricorn \u2014 and there aren't a lot of glaciers here, except on the high mountains here in East Africa. So what was going on here? We weren't covered in ice in Africa. Rather, Africa was drying out at that time. This is a paleo-climatological map of what Africa looked like between 60,000 and 70,000 years ago, reconstructed from all these pieces of evidence that I mentioned before. The reason for that is that ice actually sucks moisture out of the atmosphere. If you think about Antarctica, it's technically a desert, it gets so little precipitation.So the whole world was drying out. The sea levels were dropping. And Africa was turning to desert. The Sahara was much bigger then than it is now. And the human habitat was reduced to just a few small pockets, compared to what we have today. The evidence from genetic data is that the human population around this time, roughly 70,000 years ago, crashed to fewer than 2,000 individuals. We nearly went extinct. We were hanging on by our fingernails.And then something happened. A great illustration of it. Look at some stone tools. The ones on the left are from Africa, from around a million years ago. The ones on the right were made by Neanderthals, our distant cousins, not our direct ancestors, living in Europe, and they date from around 50,000 or 60,000 years ago. Now, at the risk of offending any paleoanthropologists or physical anthropologists in the audience, basically there's not a lot of change between these two stone tool groups. The ones on the left are pretty similar to the ones on the right. We are in a period of long cultural stasis from a million years ago until around 60,000 to 70,000 years ago. The tool styles don't change that much. The evidence is that the human way of life didn't change that much during that period.But then 50, 60, 70 thousand years ago, somewhere in that region, all hell breaks loose. Art makes its appearance. The stone tools become much more finely crafted. The evidence is that humans begin to specialize in particular prey species, at particular times of the year. The population size started to expand. Probably, according to what many linguists believe, fully modern language, syntactic language \u2014 subject, verb, object \u2014 that we use to convey complex ideas, like I'm doing now, appeared around that time. We became much more social. The social networks expanded.This change in behavior allowed us to survive these worsening conditions in Africa, and they allowed us to start to expand around the world. We've been talking at this conference about African success stories. Well, you want the ultimate African success story? Look in the mirror. You're it. The reason you're alive today is because of those changes in our brains that took place in Africa \u2014 probably somewhere in the region where we're sitting right now, around 60, 70 thousand years ago \u2014 allowing us not only to survive in Africa, but to expand out of Africa. An early coastal migration along the south coast of Asia, leaving Africa around 60,000 years ago, reaching Australia very rapidly, by 50,000 years ago. A slightly later migration up into the Middle East. These would have been savannah hunters.So those of you who are going on one of the post-conference tours, you'll get to see what a real savannah is like. And it's basically a meat locker. People who would have specialized in killing the animals, hunting the animals on those meat locker savannahs, moving up, following the grasslands into the Middle East around 45,000 years ago, during one of the rare wet phases in the Sahara. Migrating eastward, following the grasslands, because that's what they were adapted to live on.And when they reached Central Asia, they reached what was effectively a steppe super-highway, a grassland super-highway. The grasslands at that time \u2014 this was during the last ice age \u2014 stretched basically from Germany all the way over to Korea, and the entire continent was open to them. Entering Europe around 35,000 years ago, and finally, a small group migrating up through the worst weather imaginable, Siberia, inside the Arctic Circle, during the last ice age \u2014 temperature was at -70, -80, even -100, perhaps \u2014 migrating into the Americas, ultimately reaching that final frontier.An amazing story, and it happened first in Africa. The changes that allowed us to do that, the evolution of this highly adaptable brain that we all carry around with us, allowing us to create novel cultures, allowing us to develop the diversity that we see on a whirlwind trip like the one I've just been on.Now, that story I just told you is literally a whirlwind tour of how we populated the world, the great Paleolithic wanderings of our species. And that's the story that I told a couple of years ago in my book, \"The Journey of Man,\" and a film that we made with the same title. And as we were finishing up that film \u2014 it was co-produced with National Geographic \u2014 I started talking to the folks at NG about this work. And they got really excited about it. They liked the film, but they said, \"You know, we really see this as kind of the next wave in the study of human origins, where we all came from, using the tools of DNA to map the migrations around the world. You know, the study of human origins is kind of in our DNA, and we want to take it to the next level. What do you want to do next?\" Which is a great question to be asked by National Geographic.And I said, \"Well, you know, what I've sketched out here is just that. It is a very coarse sketch of how we migrated around the planet. And it's based on a few thousand people we've sampled from, you know, a handful of populations around the world. Studied a few genetic markers, and there are lots of gaps on this map. We've just connected the dots. What we need to do is increase our sample size by an order of magnitude or more \u2014 hundreds of thousands of DNA samples from people all over the world.\"And that was the genesis of the Genographic Project. The project launched in April 2005. It has three core components. Obviously, science is a big part of it. The field research that we're doing around the world with indigenous peoples. People who have lived in the same location for a long period of time retain a connection to the place where they live that many of the rest of us have lost. So my ancestors come from all over northern Europe. I live in the Eastern Seaboard of North America when I'm not traveling. Where am I indigenous to? Nowhere really. My genes are all jumbled up. But there are people who retain that link to their ancestors that allows us to contextualize the DNA results.That's the focus of the field research, the centers that we've set up all over the world \u2014 10 of them, top population geneticists. But, in addition, we wanted to open up this study to anybody around the world. How often do you get to participate in a big scientific project? The Human Genome Project, or a Mars Rover mission.In this case, you actually can. You can go onto our website, Nationalgeographic.com/genographic. You can order a kit. You can test your own DNA. And you can actually submit those results to the database, and tell us a little about your genealogical background, have the data analyzed as part of the scientific effort.Now, this is all a nonprofit enterprise, and so the money that we raise, after we cover the cost of doing the testing and making the kit components, gets plowed back into the project. The majority going to something we call the Legacy Fund. It's a charitable entity, basically a grant-giving entity that gives money back to indigenous groups around the world for educational, cultural projects initiated by them. They apply to this fund in order to do various projects, and I'll show you a couple of examples.So how are we doing on the project? We've got about 25,000 samples collected from indigenous people around the world. The most amazing thing has been the interest on the part of the public; 210,000 people have ordered these participation kits since we launched two years ago, which has raised around five million dollars, the majority of which, at least half, is going back into the Legacy Fund.We've just awarded the first Legacy Grants totaling around 500,000 dollars. Projects around the world \u2014 documenting oral poetry in Sierra Leone, preserving traditional weaving patterns in Gaza, language revitalization in Tajikistan, etc., etc. So the project is going very, very well, and I urge you to check out the website and watch this space.Thank you very much.

Because Darwin was talking about our distant ancestry,\n\n00:02:54.958 --> 00:02:56.958\nour common ancestry with apes.\n\n00:02:56.958 --> 00:03:00.958\nAnd it is quite clear that apes originated on the African continent.\n\n00:03:00.958 --> 00:03:03.958\nAround 23 million years ago, they appear in the fossil record.\n\n00:03:03.958 --> 00:03:06.958\nAfrica was actually disconnected from the other landmasses at that time,\n\n00:03:06.958 --> 00:03:10.958\ndue to the vagaries of plate tectonics, floating around the Indian Ocean.\n\n00:03:10.958 --> 00:03:12.958\nBumped into Eurasia around 16 million years ago,\n\n00:03:12.958 --> 00:03:15.958\nand then we had the first African exodus, as we call it.\n\n00:03:15.958 --> 00:03:17.958\nThe apes that left at that time ended up in Southeast Asia,\n\n00:03:17.958 --> 00:03:19.958\nbecame the gibbons and the orangutans.\n\n00:03:19.958 --> 00:03:21.958\nAnd the ones that stayed on in Africa\n\n00:03:21.958 --> 00:03:23.958\nevolved into the gorillas, the chimpanzees and us.\n\n00:03:23.958 --> 00:03:26.958\nSo, yes, if you're talking about our common ancestry with apes,\n\n00:03:26.958 --> 00:03:30.958\nit's very clear, by looking at the fossil record, we started off here.\n\n00:03:30.958 --> 00:03:32.958\nBut that's not really the question I'm asking.\n\n00:03:32.958 --> 00:03:34.958\nI'm asking about our human ancestry,\n\n00:03:34.958 --> 00:03:37.958\nthings that we would recognize as being like us\n\n00:03:37.958 --> 00:03:39.958\nif they were sitting here in the room.\n\n00:03:39.958 --> 00:03:41.958\nIf they were peering over your shoulder,\n\n00:03:41.958 --> 00:03:44.958\nyou wouldn't leap back, like that. What about our human ancestry?\n\n00:03:44.958 --> 00:03:46.958\nBecause if we go far enough back,\n\n00:03:46.958 --> 00:03:49.958\nwe share a common ancestry with every living thing on Earth.\n\n00:03:49.958 --> 00:03:52.958\nDNA ties us all together, so we share ancestry with barracuda\n\n00:03:52.958 --> 00:03:57.958\nand bacteria and mushrooms, if you go far enough back -- over a billion years.\n\n00:03:57.958 --> 00:03:59.958\nWhat we're asking about though is human ancestry.\n\n00:03:59.958 --> 00:04:01.958\nHow do we study that?\n\n00:04:01.958 --> 00:04:05.958\nWell, historically, it has been studied using the science of paleoanthropology.\n\n00:04:05.958 --> 00:04:07.958\nDigging things up out of the ground,\n\n00:04:07.958 --> 00:04:09.958\nand largely on the basis of morphology --\n\n00:04:09.958 --> 00:04:12.958\nthe way things are shaped, often skull shape -- saying,\n\n00:04:12.958 --> 00:04:16.958\n\"This looks a little bit more like us than that, so this must be my ancestor.\n\n00:04:16.958 --> 00:04:19.958\nThis must be who I'm directly descended from.\"\n\n00:04:19.958 --> 00:04:22.958\nThe field of paleoanthropology, I'll argue,\n\n00:04:22.958 --> 00:04:25.958\ngives us lots of fascinating possibilities about our ancestry,\n\n00:04:25.958 --> 00:04:28.958\nbut it doesn't give us the probabilities that we really want as scientists.\n\n00:04:28.958 --> 00:04:30.958\nWhat do I mean by that?\n\n00:04:30.958 --> 00:04:32.958\nYou're looking at a great example here.\n\n00:04:32.958 --> 00:04:34.958\nThese are three extinct species of hominids,\n\n00:04:34.958 --> 00:04:36.958\npotential human ancestors.\n\n00:04:36.958 --> 00:04:39.958\nAll dug up just west of here in Olduvai Gorge, by the Leakey family.\n\n00:04:39.958 --> 00:04:41.958\nAnd they're all dating to roughly the same time.\n\n00:04:41.958 --> 00:04:43.958\nFrom left to right, we've got Homo erectus, Homo habilis,\n\n00:04:43.958 --> 00:04:46.958\nand Australopithecus -- now called Paranthropus boisei,\n\n00:04:46.958 --> 00:04:51.958\nthe robust australopithecine. Three extinct species, same place, same time.\n\n00:04:51.958 --> 00:04:54.958\nThat means that not all three could be my direct ancestor.\n\n00:04:54.958 --> 00:04:57.958\nWhich one of these guys am I actually related to?\n\n00:04:57.958 --> 00:05:02.958\nPossibilities about our ancestry, but not the probabilities that we're really looking for.\n\n00:05:03.958 --> 00:05:07.958\nWell, a different approach has been to look at morphology in humans\n\n00:05:07.958 --> 00:05:10.958\nusing the only data that people really had at hand until quite recently --\n\n00:05:10.958 --> 00:05:12.958\nagain, largely skull shape.\n\n00:05:12.958 --> 00:05:16.958\nThe first person to do this systematically was Linnaeus,\n\n00:05:16.958 --> 00:05:18.958\nCarl von Linne, a Swedish botanist,\n\n00:05:18.958 --> 00:05:20.958\nwho in the eighteenth century took it upon himself\n\n00:05:20.958 --> 00:05:22.958\nto categorize every living organism on the planet.\n\n00:05:22.958 --> 00:05:24.958\nYou think you've got a tough job?\n\n00:05:24.958 --> 00:05:26.958\nAnd he did a pretty good job.\n\n00:05:26.958 --> 00:05:30.958\nHe categorized about 12,000 species in \"Systema Naturae.\"\n\n00:05:30.958 --> 00:05:33.958\nHe actually coined the term Homo sapiens -- it means wise man in Latin.\n\n00:05:33.958 --> 00:05:37.958\nBut looking around the world at the diversity of humans, he said,\n\n00:05:37.958 --> 00:05:41.958\n\"Well, you know, we seem to come in discreet sub-species or categories.\"\n\n00:05:41.958 --> 00:05:45.958\nAnd he talked about Africans and Americans and Asians and Europeans,\n\n00:05:45.958 --> 00:05:48.958\nand a blatantly racist category he termed \"Monstrosus,\"\n\n00:05:48.958 --> 00:05:51.958\nwhich basically included all the people he didn't like,\n\n00:05:51.958 --> 00:05:54.958\nincluding imaginary folk like elves.\n\n00:05:55.958 --> 00:06:00.958\nIt's easy to dismiss this as the perhaps well-intentioned\n\n00:06:00.958 --> 00:06:03.958\nbut ultimately benighted musings of an eighteenth century scientist\n\n00:06:03.958 --> 00:06:05.958\nworking in the pre-Darwinian era.\n\n00:06:05.958 --> 00:06:07.958\nExcept, if you had taken physical anthropology\n\n00:06:07.958 --> 00:06:11.958\nas recently as 20 or 30 years ago, in many cases you would have learned\n\n00:06:11.958 --> 00:06:13.958\nbasically that same classification of humanity.\n\n00:06:13.958 --> 00:06:18.958\nHuman races that according to physical anthropologists of 30, 40 years ago --\n\n00:06:18.958 --> 00:06:20.958\nCarlton Coon is the best example --\n\n00:06:20.958 --> 00:06:24.958\nhad been diverging from each other -- this was in the post-Darwinian era --\n\n00:06:24.958 --> 00:06:27.958\nfor over a million years, since the time of Homo erectus.\n\n00:06:27.958 --> 00:06:29.958\nBut based on what data?\n\n00:06:29.958 --> 00:06:33.958\nVery little. Very little. Morphology and a lot of guesswork.\n\n00:06:33.958 --> 00:06:35.958\nWell, what I'm going to talk about today,\n\n00:06:35.958 --> 00:06:38.958\nwhat I'm going to talk about now is a new approach to this problem.\n\n00:06:38.958 --> 00:06:41.958\nInstead of going out and guessing about our ancestry,\n\n00:06:41.958 --> 00:06:43.958\ndigging things up out of the ground, possible ancestors,\n\n00:06:43.958 --> 00:06:45.958\nand saying it on the basis of morphology --\n\n00:06:45.958 --> 00:06:47.958\nwhich we still don't completely understand,\n\n00:06:47.958 --> 00:06:51.958\nwe don't know the genetic causes underlying this morphological variation --\n\n00:06:51.958 --> 00:06:53.958\nwhat we need to do is turn the problem on its head.\n\n00:06:53.958 --> 00:06:57.958\nBecause what we're really asking is a genealogical problem,\n\n00:06:57.958 --> 00:06:59.958\nor a genealogical question.\n\n00:06:59.958 --> 00:07:04.958\nWhat we're trying to do is construct a family tree for everybody alive today.\n\n00:07:04.958 --> 00:07:06.958\nAnd as any genealogist will tell you --\n\n00:07:06.958 --> 00:07:08.958\nanybody have a member of the family, or maybe you\n\n00:07:08.958 --> 00:07:11.958\nhave tried to construct a family tree, trace back in time?\n\n00:07:11.958 --> 00:07:13.958\nYou start in the present, with relationships you're certain about.\n\n00:07:13.958 --> 00:07:15.958\nYou and your siblings, you have a parent in common.\n\n00:07:15.958 --> 00:07:17.958\nYou and your cousins share a grandparent in common.\n\n00:07:17.958 --> 00:07:20.958\nYou gradually trace further and further back into the past,\n\n00:07:20.958 --> 00:07:22.958\nadding these ever more distant relationships.\n\n00:07:22.958 --> 00:07:26.958\nBut eventually, no matter how good you are at digging up the church records,\n\n00:07:26.958 --> 00:07:30.958\nand all that stuff, you hit what the genealogists call a brick wall.\n\n00:07:30.958 --> 00:07:33.958\nA point beyond which you don't know anything else about your ancestors,\n\n00:07:33.958 --> 00:07:37.958\nand you enter this dark and mysterious realm we call history\n\n00:07:37.958 --> 00:07:40.958\nthat we have to feel our way through with whispered guidance.\n\n00:07:40.958 --> 00:07:42.958\nWho were these people who came before?\n\n00:07:42.958 --> 00:07:45.958\nWe have no written record. Well, actually, we do.\n\n00:07:45.958 --> 00:07:48.958\nWritten in our DNA, in our genetic code --\n\n00:07:48.958 --> 00:07:50.958\nwe have a historical document that takes us back in time\n\n00:07:50.958 --> 00:07:54.958\nto the very earliest days of our species. And that's what we study.\n\n00:07:54.958 --> 00:07:56.958\nNow, a quick primer on DNA.\n\n00:07:56.958 --> 00:07:59.958\nI suspect that not everybody in the audience is a geneticist.\n\n00:07:59.958 --> 00:08:03.958\nIt is a very long, linear molecule, a coded version\n\n00:08:03.958 --> 00:08:06.958\nof how to make another copy of you. It's your blueprint.\n\n00:08:06.958 --> 00:08:09.958\nIt's composed of four subunits: A, C, G and T, we call them.\n\n00:08:09.958 --> 00:08:13.958\nAnd it's the sequence of those subunits that defines that blueprint.\n\n00:08:13.958 --> 00:08:16.958\nHow long is it? Well, it's billions of these subunits in length.\n\n00:08:16.958 --> 00:08:19.958\nA haploid genome -- we actually have two copies of all of our chromosomes --\n\n00:08:19.958 --> 00:08:23.958\na haploid genome is around 3.2 billion nucleotides in length.\n\n00:08:23.958 --> 00:08:25.958\nAnd the whole thing, if you add it all together,\n\n00:08:25.958 --> 00:08:27.958\nis over six billion nucleotides long.\n\n00:08:27.958 --> 00:08:30.958\nIf you take all the DNA out of one cell in your body,\n\n00:08:30.958 --> 00:08:34.958\nand stretch it end to end, it's around two meters long.\n\n00:08:34.958 --> 00:08:36.958\nIf you take all the DNA out of every cell in your body,\n\n00:08:36.958 --> 00:08:40.958\nand you stretch it end to end, it would reach from here to the moon and back,\n\n00:08:40.958 --> 00:08:43.958\nthousands of times. It's a lot of information.\n\n00:08:43.958 --> 00:08:49.958\nAnd so when you're copying this DNA molecule to pass it on, it's a pretty tough job.\n\n00:08:49.958 --> 00:08:53.958\nImagine the longest book you can think of, \"War and Peace.\"\n\n00:08:53.958 --> 00:08:55.958\nNow multiply it by 100.\n\n00:08:55.958 --> 00:08:57.958\nAnd imagine copying that by hand.\n\n00:08:57.958 --> 00:08:59.958\nAnd you're working away until late at night,\n\n00:08:59.958 --> 00:09:01.958\nand you're very, very careful, and you're drinking coffee\n\n00:09:01.958 --> 00:09:03.958\nand you're paying attention, but, occasionally,\n\n00:09:03.958 --> 00:09:05.958\nwhen you're copying this by hand,\n\n00:09:05.958 --> 00:09:07.958\nyou're going to make a little typo, a spelling mistake --\n\n00:09:07.958 --> 00:09:11.958\nsubstitute an I for an E, or a C for a T.\n\n00:09:11.958 --> 00:09:15.958\nSame thing happens to our DNA as it's being passed on through the generations.\n\n00:09:15.958 --> 00:09:18.958\nIt doesn't happen very often. We have a proofreading mechanism built in.\n\n00:09:18.958 --> 00:09:20.958\nBut when it does happen, and these changes get transmitted down\n\n00:09:20.958 --> 00:09:23.958\nthrough the generations, they become markers of descent.\n\n00:09:23.958 --> 00:09:25.958\nIf you share a marker with someone,\n\n00:09:25.958 --> 00:09:28.958\nit means you share an ancestor at some point in the past,\n\n00:09:28.958 --> 00:09:30.958\nthe person who first had that change in their DNA.\n\n00:09:30.958 --> 00:09:33.958\nAnd it's by looking at the pattern of genetic variation,\n\n00:09:33.958 --> 00:09:36.958\nthe pattern of these markers in people all over the world,\n\n00:09:36.958 --> 00:09:40.958\nand assessing the relative ages when they occurred throughout our history,\n\n00:09:40.958 --> 00:09:43.958\nthat we've been able to construct a family tree for everybody alive today.\n\n00:09:43.958 --> 00:09:46.958\nThese are two pieces of DNA that we use quite widely in our work.\n\n00:09:46.958 --> 00:09:49.958\nMitochondrial DNA, tracing a purely maternal line of descent.\n\n00:09:49.958 --> 00:09:52.958\nYou get your mtDNA from your mother, and your mother's mother,\n\n00:09:52.958 --> 00:09:54.958\nall the way back to the very first woman.\n\n00:09:54.958 --> 00:09:57.958\nThe Y chromosome, the piece of DNA that makes men men,\n\n00:09:57.958 --> 00:10:00.958\ntraces a purely paternal line of descent.\n\n00:10:00.958 --> 00:10:04.958\nEverybody in this room, everybody in the world,\n\n00:10:04.958 --> 00:10:08.958\nfalls into a lineage somewhere on these trees.\n\n00:10:08.958 --> 00:10:11.958\nNow, even though these are simplified versions of the real trees,\n\n00:10:11.958 --> 00:10:13.958\nthey're still kind of complicated, so let's simplify them.\n\n00:10:13.958 --> 00:10:15.958\nTurn them on their sides, combine them so that they look like a tree\n\n00:10:15.958 --> 00:10:18.958\nwith the root at the bottom and the branches going up.\n\n00:10:18.958 --> 00:10:20.958\nWhat's the take-home message?\n\n00:10:20.958 --> 00:10:22.958\nWell, the thing that jumps out at you first\n\n00:10:22.958 --> 00:10:25.958\nis that the deepest lineages in our family trees\n\n00:10:25.958 --> 00:10:30.958\nare found within Africa, among Africans.\n\n00:10:30.958 --> 00:10:33.958\nThat means that Africans have been accumulating\n\n00:10:33.958 --> 00:10:36.958\nthis mutational diversity for longer.\n\n00:10:36.958 --> 00:10:40.958\nAnd what that means is that we originated in Africa. It's written in our DNA.\n\n00:10:40.958 --> 00:10:45.958\nEvery piece of DNA we look at has greater diversity within Africa than outside of Africa.\n\n00:10:45.958 --> 00:10:48.958\nAnd at some point in the past, a sub-group of Africans\n\n00:10:48.958 --> 00:10:52.958\nleft the African continent to go out and populate the rest of the world.\n\n00:10:52.958 --> 00:10:54.958\nNow, how recently do we share this ancestry?\n\n00:10:54.958 --> 00:10:58.958\nWas it millions of years ago, which we might suspect\n\n00:10:58.958 --> 00:11:01.958\nby looking at all this incredible variation around the world?\n\n00:11:01.958 --> 00:11:04.958\nNo, the DNA tells a story that's very clear.\n\n00:11:04.958 --> 00:11:09.958\nWithin the last 200,000 years, we all share an ancestor, a single person --\n\n00:11:09.958 --> 00:11:13.958\nMitochondrial Eve, you might have heard about her -- in Africa,\n\n00:11:13.958 --> 00:11:16.958\nan African woman who gave rise to all the mitochondrial diversity in the world today.\n\n00:11:16.958 --> 00:11:18.958\nBut what's even more amazing\n\n00:11:18.958 --> 00:11:20.958\nis that if you look at the Y-chromosome side,\n\n00:11:20.958 --> 00:11:24.958\nthe male side of the story, the Y-chromosome Adam\n\n00:11:24.958 --> 00:11:26.958\nonly lived around 60,000 years ago.\n\n00:11:26.958 --> 00:11:29.958\nThat's only about 2,000 human generations,\n\n00:11:29.958 --> 00:11:32.958\nthe blink of an eye in an evolutionary sense.\n\n00:11:33.958 --> 00:11:36.958\nThat tells us we were all still living in Africa at that time.\n\n00:11:36.958 --> 00:11:38.958\nThis was an African man who gave rise\n\n00:11:38.958 --> 00:11:40.958\nto all the Y chromosome diversity around the world.\n\n00:11:40.958 --> 00:11:42.958\nIt's only within the last 60,000 years\n\n00:11:42.958 --> 00:11:46.958\nthat we have started to generate this incredible diversity we see around the world.\n\n00:11:46.958 --> 00:11:48.958\nSuch an amazing story.\n\n00:11:48.958 --> 00:11:51.958\nWe're all effectively part of an extended African family.\n\n00:11:52.958 --> 00:11:55.958\nNow, that seems so recent. Why didn't we start to leave earlier?\n\n00:11:55.958 --> 00:11:59.958\nWhy didn't Homo erectus evolve into separate species,\n\n00:11:59.958 --> 00:12:01.958\nor sub-species rather, human races around the world?\n\n00:12:01.958 --> 00:12:05.958\nWhy was it that we seem to have come out of Africa so recently?\n\n00:12:05.958 --> 00:12:07.958\nWell, that's a big question. These \"why\" questions,\n\n00:12:07.958 --> 00:12:12.958\nparticularly in genetics and the study of history in general, are always the big ones,\n\n00:12:12.958 --> 00:12:14.958\nthe ones that are tough to answer.\n\n00:12:14.958 --> 00:12:17.958\nAnd so when all else fails, talk about the weather.\n\n00:12:17.958 --> 00:12:20.958\nWhat was going on to the world's weather around 60,000 years ago?\n\n00:12:20.958 --> 00:12:23.958\nWell, we were going into the worst part of the last ice age.\n\n00:12:23.958 --> 00:12:26.958\nThe last ice age started roughly 120,000 years ago.\n\n00:12:26.958 --> 00:12:30.958\nIt went up and down, and it really started to accelerate around 70,000 years ago.\n\n00:12:30.958 --> 00:12:32.958\nLots of evidence from sediment cores\n\n00:12:32.958 --> 00:12:35.958\nand the pollen types, oxygen isotopes and so on.\n\n00:12:35.958 --> 00:12:38.958\nWe hit the last glacial maximum around 16,000 years ago,\n\n00:12:38.958 --> 00:12:42.958\nbut basically, from 70,000 years on, things were getting really tough,\n\n00:12:42.958 --> 00:12:47.958\ngetting very cold. The Northern Hemisphere had massive growing ice sheets.\n\n00:12:47.958 --> 00:12:51.958\nNew York City, Chicago, Seattle, all under a sheet of ice.\n\n00:12:51.958 --> 00:12:56.958\nMost of Britain, all of Scandinavia, covered by ice several kilometers thick.\n\n00:12:56.958 --> 00:12:59.958\nNow, Africa is the most tropical continent on the planet --\n\n00:12:59.958 --> 00:13:03.958\nabout 85 percent of it lies between Cancer and Capricorn --\n\n00:13:03.958 --> 00:13:05.958\nand there aren't a lot of glaciers here,\n\n00:13:05.958 --> 00:13:07.958\nexcept on the high mountains here in East Africa.\n\n00:13:07.958 --> 00:13:10.958\nSo what was going on here? We weren't covered in ice in Africa.\n\n00:13:10.958 --> 00:13:13.958\nRather, Africa was drying out at that time.\n\n00:13:13.958 --> 00:13:15.958\nThis is a paleo-climatological map\n\n00:13:15.958 --> 00:13:18.958\nof what Africa looked like between 60,000 and 70,000 years ago,\n\n00:13:18.958 --> 00:13:22.958\nreconstructed from all these pieces of evidence that I mentioned before.\n\n00:13:22.958 --> 00:13:26.958\nThe reason for that is that ice actually sucks moisture out of the atmosphere.\n\n00:13:26.958 --> 00:13:30.958\nIf you think about Antarctica, it's technically a desert, it gets so little precipitation.\n\n00:13:30.958 --> 00:13:32.958\nSo the whole world was drying out.\n\n00:13:32.958 --> 00:13:36.958\nThe sea levels were dropping. And Africa was turning to desert.\n\n00:13:36.958 --> 00:13:39.958\nThe Sahara was much bigger then than it is now.\n\n00:13:39.958 --> 00:13:42.958\nAnd the human habitat was reduced to just a few small pockets,\n\n00:13:42.958 --> 00:13:44.958\ncompared to what we have today.\n\n00:13:44.958 --> 00:13:46.958\nThe evidence from genetic data\n\n00:13:46.958 --> 00:13:49.958\nis that the human population around this time, roughly 70,000 years ago,\n\n00:13:49.958 --> 00:13:52.958\ncrashed to fewer than 2,000 individuals.\n\n00:13:52.958 --> 00:13:56.958\nWe nearly went extinct. We were hanging on by our fingernails.\n\n00:13:56.958 --> 00:13:59.958\nAnd then something happened. A great illustration of it.\n\n00:13:59.958 --> 00:14:01.958\nLook at some stone tools.\n\n00:14:01.958 --> 00:14:05.958\nThe ones on the left are from Africa, from around a million years ago.\n\n00:14:05.958 --> 00:14:08.958\nThe ones on the right were made by Neanderthals, our distant cousins,\n\n00:14:08.958 --> 00:14:10.958\nnot our direct ancestors, living in Europe,\n\n00:14:10.958 --> 00:14:14.958\nand they date from around 50,000 or 60,000 years ago.\n\n00:14:14.958 --> 00:14:17.958\nNow, at the risk of offending any paleoanthropologists\n\n00:14:17.958 --> 00:14:20.958\nor physical anthropologists in the audience,\n\n00:14:20.958 --> 00:14:25.958\nbasically there's not a lot of change between these two stone tool groups.\n\n00:14:25.958 --> 00:14:28.958\nThe ones on the left are pretty similar to the ones on the right.\n\n00:14:28.958 --> 00:14:32.958\nWe are in a period of long cultural stasis from a million years ago\n\n00:14:32.958 --> 00:14:34.958\nuntil around 60,000 to 70,000 years ago.\n\n00:14:34.958 --> 00:14:36.958\nThe tool styles don't change that much.\n\n00:14:36.958 --> 00:14:38.958\nThe evidence is that the human way of life\n\n00:14:38.958 --> 00:14:40.958\ndidn't change that much during that period.\n\n00:14:40.958 --> 00:14:45.958\nBut then 50, 60, 70 thousand years ago, somewhere in that region,\n\n00:14:45.958 --> 00:14:48.958\nall hell breaks loose. Art makes its appearance.\n\n00:14:48.958 --> 00:14:51.958\nThe stone tools become much more finely crafted.\n\n00:14:51.958 --> 00:14:53.958\nThe evidence is that humans begin to specialize in particular prey species,\n\n00:14:54.958 --> 00:14:56.958\nat particular times of the year.\n\n00:14:56.958 --> 00:14:59.958\nThe population size started to expand.\n\n00:14:59.958 --> 00:15:01.958\nProbably, according to what many linguists believe,\n\n00:15:01.958 --> 00:15:05.958\nfully modern language, syntactic language -- subject, verb, object --\n\n00:15:05.958 --> 00:15:09.958\nthat we use to convey complex ideas, like I'm doing now, appeared around that time.\n\n00:15:09.958 --> 00:15:13.958\nWe became much more social. The social networks expanded.\n\n00:15:13.958 --> 00:15:18.958\nThis change in behavior allowed us to survive these worsening conditions in Africa,\n\n00:15:18.958 --> 00:15:22.958\nand they allowed us to start to expand around the world.\n\n00:15:23.958 --> 00:15:26.958\nWe've been talking at this conference about African success stories.\n\n00:15:26.958 --> 00:15:29.958\nWell, you want the ultimate African success story?\n\n00:15:29.958 --> 00:15:32.958\nLook in the mirror. You're it. The reason you're alive today\n\n00:15:32.958 --> 00:15:36.958\nis because of those changes in our brains that took place in Africa --\n\n00:15:36.958 --> 00:15:39.958\nprobably somewhere in the region where we're sitting right now,\n\n00:15:39.958 --> 00:15:42.958\naround 60, 70 thousand years ago --\n\n00:15:42.958 --> 00:15:45.958\nallowing us not only to survive in Africa, but to expand out of Africa.\n\n00:15:45.958 --> 00:15:48.958\nAn early coastal migration along the south coast of Asia,\n\n00:15:48.958 --> 00:15:50.958\nleaving Africa around 60,000 years ago,\n\n00:15:50.958 --> 00:15:54.958\nreaching Australia very rapidly, by 50,000 years ago.\n\n00:15:54.958 --> 00:15:56.958\nA slightly later migration up into the Middle East.\n\n00:15:56.958 --> 00:15:58.958\nThese would have been savannah hunters.\n\n00:15:58.958 --> 00:16:00.958\nSo those of you who are going on one of the post-conference tours,\n\n00:16:00.958 --> 00:16:02.958\nyou'll get to see what a real savannah is like.\n\n00:16:02.958 --> 00:16:04.958\nAnd it's basically a meat locker.\n\n00:16:04.958 --> 00:16:07.958\nPeople who would have specialized in killing the animals,\n\n00:16:07.958 --> 00:16:10.958\nhunting the animals on those meat locker savannahs, moving up,\n\n00:16:10.958 --> 00:16:14.958\nfollowing the grasslands into the Middle East around 45,000 years ago,\n\n00:16:14.958 --> 00:16:16.958\nduring one of the rare wet phases in the Sahara.\n\n00:16:16.958 --> 00:16:19.958\nMigrating eastward, following the grasslands,\n\n00:16:19.958 --> 00:16:21.958\nbecause that's what they were adapted to live on.\n\n00:16:21.958 --> 00:16:23.958\nAnd when they reached Central Asia,\n\n00:16:23.958 --> 00:16:26.958\nthey reached what was effectively a steppe super-highway,\n\n00:16:26.958 --> 00:16:28.958\na grassland super-highway.\n\n00:16:28.958 --> 00:16:30.958\nThe grasslands at that time -- this was during the last ice age --\n\n00:16:30.958 --> 00:16:33.958\nstretched basically from Germany all the way over to Korea,\n\n00:16:33.958 --> 00:16:35.958\nand the entire continent was open to them.\n\n00:16:35.958 --> 00:16:37.958\nEntering Europe around 35,000 years ago,\n\n00:16:37.958 --> 00:16:39.958\nand finally, a small group migrating up\n\n00:16:39.958 --> 00:16:43.958\nthrough the worst weather imaginable, Siberia,\n\n00:16:43.958 --> 00:16:45.958\ninside the Arctic Circle, during the last ice age --\n\n00:16:45.958 --> 00:16:49.958\ntemperature was at -70, -80, even -100, perhaps --\n\n00:16:49.958 --> 00:16:53.958\nmigrating into the Americas, ultimately reaching that final frontier.\n\n00:16:53.958 --> 00:16:57.958\nAn amazing story, and it happened first in Africa.\n\n00:16:57.958 --> 00:16:59.958\nThe changes that allowed us to do that,\n\n00:16:59.958 --> 00:17:02.958\nthe evolution of this highly adaptable brain that we all carry around with us,\n\n00:17:02.958 --> 00:17:04.958\nallowing us to create novel cultures,\n\n00:17:04.958 --> 00:17:07.958\nallowing us to develop the diversity\n\n00:17:07.958 --> 00:17:10.958\nthat we see on a whirlwind trip like the one I've just been on.\n\n00:17:11.958 --> 00:17:15.958\nNow, that story I just told you is literally a whirlwind tour\n\n00:17:15.958 --> 00:17:20.958\nof how we populated the world, the great Paleolithic wanderings of our species.\n\n00:17:20.958 --> 00:17:22.958\nAnd that's the story that I told a couple of years ago\n\n00:17:22.958 --> 00:17:26.958\nin my book, \"The Journey of Man,\" and a film that we made with the same title.\n\n00:17:26.958 --> 00:17:29.958\nAnd as we were finishing up that film --\n\n00:17:29.958 --> 00:17:31.958\nit was co-produced with National Geographic --\n\n00:17:31.958 --> 00:17:34.958\nI started talking to the folks at NG about this work.\n\n00:17:34.958 --> 00:17:38.958\nAnd they got really excited about it. They liked the film, but they said,\n\n00:17:38.958 --> 00:17:40.958\n\"You know, we really see this as kind of\n\n00:17:40.958 --> 00:17:44.958\nthe next wave in the study of human origins, where we all came from,\n\n00:17:44.958 --> 00:17:49.958\nusing the tools of DNA to map the migrations around the world.\n\n00:17:49.958 --> 00:17:51.958\nYou know, the study of human origins is kind of in our DNA,\n\n00:17:51.958 --> 00:17:53.958\nand we want to take it to the next level.\n\n00:17:53.958 --> 00:17:55.958\nWhat do you want to do next?\"\n\n00:17:55.958 --> 00:17:57.958\nWhich is a great question to be asked by National Geographic.\n\n00:17:57.958 --> 00:18:01.958\nAnd I said, \"Well, you know, what I've sketched out here is just that.\n\n00:18:01.958 --> 00:18:05.958\nIt is a very coarse sketch of how we migrated around the planet.\n\n00:18:05.958 --> 00:18:08.958\nAnd it's based on a few thousand people we've sampled from,\n\n00:18:08.958 --> 00:18:10.958\nyou know, a handful of populations around the world.\n\n00:18:10.958 --> 00:18:14.958\nStudied a few genetic markers, and there are lots of gaps on this map.\n\n00:18:14.958 --> 00:18:16.958\nWe've just connected the dots. What we need to do\n\n00:18:16.958 --> 00:18:20.958\nis increase our sample size by an order of magnitude or more --\n\n00:18:20.958 --> 00:18:24.958\nhundreds of thousands of DNA samples from people all over the world.\"\n\n00:18:24.958 --> 00:18:27.958\nAnd that was the genesis of the Genographic Project.\n\n00:18:27.958 --> 00:18:30.958\nThe project launched in April 2005.\n\n00:18:30.958 --> 00:18:34.958\nIt has three core components. Obviously, science is a big part of it.\n\n00:18:34.958 --> 00:18:37.958\nThe field research that we're doing around the world with indigenous peoples.\n\n00:18:37.958 --> 00:18:40.958\nPeople who have lived in the same location for a long period of time\n\n00:18:40.958 --> 00:18:42.958\nretain a connection to the place where they live\n\n00:18:42.958 --> 00:18:44.958\nthat many of the rest of us have lost.\n\n00:18:45.958 --> 00:18:47.958\nSo my ancestors come from all over northern Europe.\n\n00:18:47.958 --> 00:18:50.958\nI live in the Eastern Seaboard of North America when I'm not traveling.\n\n00:18:50.958 --> 00:18:53.958\nWhere am I indigenous to? Nowhere really. My genes are all jumbled up.\n\n00:18:53.958 --> 00:18:56.958\nBut there are people who retain that link to their ancestors\n\n00:18:56.958 --> 00:18:59.958\nthat allows us to contextualize the DNA results.\n\n00:18:59.958 --> 00:19:01.958\nThat's the focus of the field research,\n\n00:19:01.958 --> 00:19:03.958\nthe centers that we've set up all over the world --\n\n00:19:03.958 --> 00:19:06.958\n10 of them, top population geneticists.\n\n00:19:06.958 --> 00:19:09.958\nBut, in addition, we wanted to open up this study to anybody around the world.\n\n00:19:09.958 --> 00:19:13.958\nHow often do you get to participate in a big scientific project?\n\n00:19:13.958 --> 00:19:15.958\nThe Human Genome Project, or a Mars Rover mission.\n\n00:19:15.958 --> 00:19:17.958\nIn this case, you actually can.\n\n00:19:17.958 --> 00:19:21.958\nYou can go onto our website, Nationalgeographic.com/genographic.\n\n00:19:21.958 --> 00:19:24.958\nYou can order a kit. You can test your own DNA.\n\n00:19:24.958 --> 00:19:27.958\nAnd you can actually submit those results to the database,\n\n00:19:27.958 --> 00:19:29.958\nand tell us a little about your genealogical background,\n\n00:19:29.958 --> 00:19:33.958\nhave the data analyzed as part of the scientific effort.\n\n00:19:33.958 --> 00:19:37.958\nNow, this is all a nonprofit enterprise, and so the money that we raise,\n\n00:19:37.958 --> 00:19:40.958\nafter we cover the cost of doing the testing and making the kit components,\n\n00:19:40.958 --> 00:19:42.958\ngets plowed back into the project.\n\n00:19:42.958 --> 00:19:44.958\nThe majority going to something we call the Legacy Fund.\n\n00:19:44.958 --> 00:19:48.958\nIt's a charitable entity, basically a grant-giving entity\n\n00:19:48.958 --> 00:19:50.958\nthat gives money back to indigenous groups around the world\n\n00:19:50.958 --> 00:19:54.958\nfor educational, cultural projects initiated by them.\n\n00:19:54.958 --> 00:19:56.958\nThey apply to this fund in order to do various projects,\n\n00:19:56.958 --> 00:19:58.958\nand I'll show you a couple of examples.\n\n00:19:58.958 --> 00:20:01.958\nSo how are we doing on the project? We've got about 25,000 samples\n\n00:20:01.958 --> 00:20:03.958\ncollected from indigenous people around the world.\n\n00:20:03.958 --> 00:20:06.958\nThe most amazing thing has been the interest on the part of the public;\n\n00:20:06.958 --> 00:20:09.958\n210,000 people have ordered these participation kits\n\n00:20:09.958 --> 00:20:11.958\nsince we launched two years ago,\n\n00:20:11.958 --> 00:20:14.958\nwhich has raised around five million dollars,\n\n00:20:14.958 --> 00:20:17.958\nthe majority of which, at least half, is going back into the Legacy Fund.\n\n00:20:17.958 --> 00:20:21.958\nWe've just awarded the first Legacy Grants totaling around 500,000 dollars.\n\n00:20:21.958 --> 00:20:24.958\nProjects around the world -- documenting oral poetry in Sierra Leone,\n\n00:20:24.958 --> 00:20:27.958\npreserving traditional weaving patterns in Gaza,\n\n00:20:27.958 --> 00:20:30.958\nlanguage revitalization in Tajikistan, etc., etc.\n\n00:20:30.958 --> 00:20:33.958\nSo the project is going very, very well,\n\n00:20:33.958 --> 00:20:37.958\nand I urge you to check out the website and watch this space.\n\n00:20:37.958 --> 00:20:39.958\nThank you very much.\n\n00:20:39.958 --> 00:20:41.958\n(Applause)"}, {"title": "How photography connects us", "duration": "893", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/david_griffin_on_how_photography_connects", "transcript": "Let's just start by looking at some great photographs. This is an icon of National Geographic, an Afghan refugee taken by Steve McCurry. But the Harvard Lampoon is about to come out with a parody of National Geographic, and I shudder to think what they're going to do to this photograph. Oh, the wrath of Photoshop.This is a jet landing at San Francisco, by Bruce Dale. He mounted a camera on the tail. A poetic image for a story on Tolstoy, by Sam Abell. Pygmies in the DRC, by Randy Olson. I love this photograph because it reminds me of Degas' bronze sculptures of the little dancer. A polar bear swimming in the Arctic, by Paul Nicklen. Polar bears need ice to be able to move back and forth \u2014 they're not very good swimmers \u2014 and we know what's happening to the ice. These are camels moving across the Rift Valley in Africa, photographed by Chris Johns. Shot straight down, so these are the shadows of the camels. This is a rancher in Texas, by William Albert Allard, a great portraitist. And Jane Goodall, making her own special connection, photographed by Nick Nichols. This is a soap disco in Spain, photographed by David Alan Harvey. And David said that there was lot of weird stuff happening on the dance floor. But, hey, at least it's hygienic. (Laughter) These are sea lions in Australia doing their own dance, by David Doubilet. And this is a comet, captured by Dr. Euan Mason. And finally, the bow of the Titanic, without movie stars, photographed by Emory Kristof. Photography carries a power that holds up under the relentless swirl of today's saturated, media world, because photographs emulate the way that our mind freezes a significant moment.Here's an example. Four years ago, I was at the beach with my son, and he was learning how to swim in this relatively soft surf of the Delaware beaches. But I turned away for a moment, and he got caught into a riptide and started to be pulled out towards the jetty. I can stand here right now and see, as I go tearing into the water after him, the moments slowing down and freezing into this arrangement. I can see the rocks are over here. There's a wave about to crash onto him. I can see his hands reaching out, and I can see his face in terror, looking at me, saying, \"Help me, Dad.\" I got him. The wave broke over us. We got back on shore; he was fine. We were a little bit rattled. But this flashbulb memory, as it's called, is when all the elements came together to define not just the event, but my emotional connection to it. And this is what a photograph taps into when it makes its own powerful connection to a viewer.Now I have to tell you, I was talking to Kyle last week about this, that I was going to tell this story. And he said, \"Oh, yeah, I remember that too! I remember my image of you was that you were up on the shore yelling at me.\" (Laughter) I thought I was a hero. (Laughter)So, this represents \u2014 this is a cross-sample of some remarkable images taken by some of the world's greatest photojournalists, working at the very top of their craft \u2014 except one. This photograph was taken by Dr. Euan Mason in New Zealand last year, and it was submitted and published in National Geographic. Last year, we added a section to our website called \"Your Shot,\" where anyone can submit photographs for possible publication. And it has become a wild success, tapping into the enthusiast photography community. The quality of these amateur photographs can, at times, be amazing. And seeing this reinforces, for me, that every one of us has at least one or two great photographs in them.But to be a great photojournalist, you have to have more than just one or two great photographs in you. You've got to be able to make them all the time. But even more importantly, you need to know how to create a visual narrative. You need to know how to tell a story. So I'm going to share with you some coverages that I feel demonstrate the storytelling power of photography.Photographer Nick Nichols went to document a very small and relatively unknown wildlife sanctuary in Chad, called Zakouma. The original intent was to travel there and bring back a classic story of diverse species, of an exotic locale. And that is what Nick did, up to a point. This is a serval cat. He's actually taking his own picture, shot with what's called a camera trap. There's an infrared beam that's going across, and he has stepped into the beam and taken his photograph. These are baboons at a watering hole. Nick \u2014 the camera, again, an automatic camera took thousands of pictures of this. And Nick ended up with a lot of pictures of the rear ends of baboons. (Laughter) A lion having a late night snack \u2014 notice he's got a broken tooth. And a crocodile walks up a riverbank toward its den. I love this little bit of water that comes off the back of his tail.But the centerpiece species of Zakouma are the elephants. It's one of the largest intact herds in this part of Africa. Here's a photograph shot in moonlight, something that digital photography has made a big difference for. It was with the elephants that this story pivoted. Nick, along with researcher Dr. Michael Fay, collared the matriarch of the herd. They named her Annie, and they began tracking her movements. The herd was safe within the confines of the park, because of this dedicated group of park rangers. But once the annual rains began, the herd would begin migrating to feeding grounds outside the park.And that's when they ran into trouble. For outside the safety of the park were poachers, who would hunt them down only for the value of their ivory tusks. The matriarch that they were radio tracking, after weeks of moving back and forth, in and out of the park, came to a halt outside the park. Annie had been killed, along with 20 members of her herd. And they only came for the ivory. This is actually one of the rangers. They were able to chase off one of the poachers and recover this ivory, because they couldn't leave it there, because it's still valuable. But what Nick did was he brought back a story that went beyond the old-school method of just straight, \"Isn't this an amazing world?\" And instead, created a story that touched our audiences deeply. Instead of just knowledge of this park, he created an understanding and an empathy for the elephants, the rangers and the many issues surrounding human-wildlife conflicts.Now let's go over to India. Sometimes you can tell a broad story in a focused way. We were looking at the same issue that Richard Wurman touches upon in his new world population project. For the first time in history, more people live in urban, rather than rural, environments. And most of that growth is not in the cities, but in the slums that surround them. Jonas Bendiksen, a very energetic photographer, came to me and said, \"We need to document this, and here's my proposal. Let's go all over the world and photograph every single slum around the world.\" And I said, \"Well, you know, that might be a bit ambitious for our budget.\" So instead, what we did was we decided to, instead of going out and doing what would result in what we'd consider sort of a survey story \u2014 where you just go in and see just a little bit of everything \u2014 we put Jonas into Dharavi, which is part of Mumbai, India, and let him stay there, and really get into the heart and soul of this really major part of the city. What Jonas did was not just go and do a surface look at the awful conditions that exist in such places. He saw that this was a living and breathing and vital part of how the entire urban area functioned. By staying tightly focused in one place, Jonas tapped into the soul and the enduring human spirit that underlies this community. And he did it in a beautiful way.Sometimes, though, the only way to tell a story is with a sweeping picture. We teamed up underwater photographer Brian Skerry and photojournalist Randy Olson to document the depletion of the world's fisheries. We weren't the only ones to tackle this subject, but the photographs that Brian and Randy created are among the best to capture both the human and natural devastation of overfishing. Here, in a photo by Brian, a seemingly crucified shark is caught up in a gill net off of Baja. I've seen sort of OK pictures of bycatch, the animals accidentally scooped up while fishing for a specific species. But here, Brian captured a unique view by positioning himself underneath the boat when they threw the waste overboard. And Brian then went on to even greater risk to get this never-before-made photograph of a trawl net scraping the ocean bottom.Back on land, Randy Olson photographed a makeshift fish market in Africa, where the remains of filleted fish were sold to the locals, the main parts having already been sent to Europe. And here in China, Randy shot a jellyfish market. As prime food sources are depleted, the harvest goes deeper into the oceans and brings in more such sources of protein. This is called fishing down the food chain.But there are also glimmers of hope, and I think anytime we're doing a big, big story on this, we don't really want to go and just look at all the problems. We also want to look for solutions. Brian photographed a marine sanctuary in New Zealand, where commercial fishing had been banned \u2014 the result being that the overfished species have been restored, and with them a possible solution for sustainable fisheries.Photography can also compel us to confront issues that are potentially distressing and controversial. James Nachtwey, who was honored at last year's TED, took a look at the sweep of the medical system that is utilized to handle the American wounded coming out of Iraq. It is like a tube where a wounded soldier enters on one end and exits back home, on the other. Jim started in the battlefield. Here, a medical technician tends to a wounded soldier on the helicopter ride back to the field hospital. Here is in the field hospital. The soldier on the right has the name of his daughter tattooed across his chest, as a reminder of home. From here, the more severely wounded are transported back to Germany, where they meet up with their families for the first time. And then back to the States to recuperate at veterans' hospitals, such as here in Walter Reed. And finally, often fitted with high-tech prosthesis, they exit the medical system and attempt to regain their pre-war lives. Jim took what could have been a straight-up medical science story and gave it a human dimension that touched our readers deeply.Now, these stories are great examples of how photography can be used to address some of our most important topics. But there are also times when photographers simply encounter things that are, when it comes down to it, just plain fun. Photographer Paul Nicklin traveled to Antarctica to shoot a story on leopard seals. They have been rarely photographed, partly because they are considered one of the most dangerous predators in the ocean. In fact, a year earlier, a researcher had been grabbed by one and pulled down to depth and killed. So you can imagine Paul was maybe a little bit hesitant about getting into the water. Now, what leopard seals do mostly is, they eat penguins. You know of \"The March of the Penguins.\" This is sort of the munch of the penguins. (Laughter) Here a penguin goes up to the edge and looks out to see if the coast is clear. And then everybody kind of runs out and goes out.But then Paul got in the water. And he said he was never really afraid of this. Well, this one female came up to him. She's probably \u2014 it's a shame you can't see it in the photograph, but she's 12 feet long. So, she is pretty significant in size. And Paul said he was never really afraid, because she was more curious about him than threatened. This mouthing behavior, on the right, was really her way of saying to him, \"Hey, look how big I am!\" Or you know, \"My, what big teeth you have.\" (Laughter) Then Paul thinks that she simply took pity on him. To her, here was this big, goofy creature in the water that for some reason didn't seem to be interested in chasing penguins. So what she did was she started to bring penguins to him, alive, and put them in front of him. She dropped them off, and then they would swim away. She'd kind of look at him, like \"What are you doing?\" Go back and get them, and then bring them back and drop them in front of him. And she did this over the course of a couple of days, until the point where she got so frustrated with him that she started putting them directly on top of his head. (Laughter) Which just resulted in a fantastic photograph. (Laughter) Eventually, though, Paul thinks that she just figured that he was never going to survive. This is her just puffing out, you know, snorting out in disgust. (Laughter) And lost interest with him, and went back to what she does best.Paul set out to photograph a relatively mysterious and unknown creature, and came back with not just a collection of photographs, but an amazing experience and a great story. It is these kinds of stories, ones that go beyond the immediate or just the superficial that demonstrate the power of photojournalism. I believe that photography can make a real connection to people, and can be employed as a positive agent for understanding the challenges and opportunities facing our world today. Thank you.

The wave broke over us.\n\n00:03:15.958 --> 00:03:17.958\nWe got back on shore; he was fine.\n\n00:03:17.958 --> 00:03:19.958\nWe were a little bit rattled.\n\n00:03:19.958 --> 00:03:23.958\nBut this flashbulb memory, as it's called,\n\n00:03:23.958 --> 00:03:25.958\nis when all the elements came together to define\n\n00:03:25.958 --> 00:03:30.958\nnot just the event, but my emotional connection to it.\n\n00:03:30.958 --> 00:03:32.958\nAnd this is what a photograph taps into\n\n00:03:32.958 --> 00:03:35.958\nwhen it makes its own powerful connection to a viewer.\n\n00:03:35.958 --> 00:03:37.958\nNow I have to tell you,\n\n00:03:37.958 --> 00:03:39.958\nI was talking to Kyle last week about this,\n\n00:03:39.958 --> 00:03:41.958\nthat I was going to tell this story.\n\n00:03:41.958 --> 00:03:43.958\nAnd he said, \"Oh, yeah, I remember that too!\n\n00:03:43.958 --> 00:03:45.958\nI remember my image of you\n\n00:03:45.958 --> 00:03:47.958\nwas that you were up on the shore yelling at me.\"\n\n00:03:47.958 --> 00:03:49.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:03:49.958 --> 00:03:51.958\nI thought I was a hero.\n\n00:03:51.958 --> 00:03:52.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:03:52.958 --> 00:03:55.958\nSo,\n\n00:03:55.958 --> 00:03:57.958\nthis represents -- this is a cross-sample of\n\n00:03:57.958 --> 00:04:01.958\nsome remarkable images taken by some of the world's greatest photojournalists,\n\n00:04:01.958 --> 00:04:04.958\nworking at the very top of their craft --\n\n00:04:04.958 --> 00:04:06.958\nexcept one.\n\n00:04:06.958 --> 00:04:09.958\nThis photograph was taken by Dr. Euan Mason\n\n00:04:09.958 --> 00:04:11.958\nin New Zealand last year,\n\n00:04:11.958 --> 00:04:14.958\nand it was submitted and published in National Geographic.\n\n00:04:14.958 --> 00:04:16.958\nLast year, we added a section to our website called \"Your Shot,\"\n\n00:04:16.958 --> 00:04:20.958\nwhere anyone can submit photographs for possible publication.\n\n00:04:20.958 --> 00:04:23.958\nAnd it has become a wild success,\n\n00:04:23.958 --> 00:04:26.958\ntapping into the enthusiast photography community.\n\n00:04:26.958 --> 00:04:28.958\nThe quality of these amateur photographs\n\n00:04:28.958 --> 00:04:30.958\ncan, at times, be amazing.\n\n00:04:30.958 --> 00:04:32.958\nAnd seeing this reinforces, for me,\n\n00:04:32.958 --> 00:04:35.958\nthat every one of us has at least one or two\n\n00:04:35.958 --> 00:04:37.958\ngreat photographs in them.\n\n00:04:37.958 --> 00:04:40.958\nBut to be a great photojournalist,\n\n00:04:40.958 --> 00:04:42.958\nyou have to have more than just one or two\n\n00:04:42.958 --> 00:04:44.958\ngreat photographs in you.\n\n00:04:44.958 --> 00:04:46.958\nYou've got to be able to make them all the time.\n\n00:04:46.958 --> 00:04:49.958\nBut even more importantly,\n\n00:04:49.958 --> 00:04:52.958\nyou need to know how to create a visual narrative.\n\n00:04:52.958 --> 00:04:55.958\nYou need to know how to tell a story.\n\n00:04:55.958 --> 00:04:57.958\nSo I'm going to share with you some coverages\n\n00:04:57.958 --> 00:05:00.958\nthat I feel demonstrate the storytelling power of photography.\n\n00:05:02.958 --> 00:05:05.958\nPhotographer Nick Nichols went to document\n\n00:05:05.958 --> 00:05:08.958\na very small and relatively unknown wildlife sanctuary\n\n00:05:08.958 --> 00:05:10.958\nin Chad, called Zakouma.\n\n00:05:11.958 --> 00:05:13.958\nThe original intent was to travel there\n\n00:05:13.958 --> 00:05:15.958\nand bring back a classic story of diverse species,\n\n00:05:15.958 --> 00:05:17.958\nof an exotic locale.\n\n00:05:17.958 --> 00:05:19.958\nAnd that is what Nick did, up to a point.\n\n00:05:19.958 --> 00:05:21.958\nThis is a serval cat.\n\n00:05:21.958 --> 00:05:23.958\nHe's actually taking his own picture,\n\n00:05:23.958 --> 00:05:25.958\nshot with what's called a camera trap.\n\n00:05:25.958 --> 00:05:27.958\nThere's an infrared beam that's going across,\n\n00:05:27.958 --> 00:05:29.958\nand he has stepped into the beam and taken his photograph.\n\n00:05:29.958 --> 00:05:33.958\nThese are baboons at a watering hole.\n\n00:05:34.958 --> 00:05:36.958\nNick -- the camera, again, an automatic camera\n\n00:05:36.958 --> 00:05:38.958\ntook thousands of pictures of this.\n\n00:05:38.958 --> 00:05:40.958\nAnd Nick ended up with a lot of pictures\n\n00:05:40.958 --> 00:05:42.958\nof the rear ends of baboons.\n\n00:05:42.958 --> 00:05:43.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:05:43.958 --> 00:05:46.958\nA lion having a late night snack --\n\n00:05:46.958 --> 00:05:48.958\nnotice he's got a broken tooth.\n\n00:05:51.958 --> 00:05:54.958\nAnd a crocodile walks up a riverbank toward its den.\n\n00:05:54.958 --> 00:05:56.958\nI love this little bit of water\n\n00:05:56.958 --> 00:05:58.958\nthat comes off the back of his tail.\n\n00:06:00.958 --> 00:06:03.958\nBut the centerpiece species of Zakouma are the elephants.\n\n00:06:03.958 --> 00:06:07.958\nIt's one of the largest intact herds in this part of Africa.\n\n00:06:07.958 --> 00:06:09.958\nHere's a photograph shot in moonlight,\n\n00:06:09.958 --> 00:06:12.958\nsomething that digital photography has made a big difference for.\n\n00:06:12.958 --> 00:06:14.958\nIt was with the elephants that this story pivoted.\n\n00:06:14.958 --> 00:06:18.958\nNick, along with researcher Dr. Michael Fay,\n\n00:06:18.958 --> 00:06:20.958\ncollared the matriarch of the herd.\n\n00:06:20.958 --> 00:06:22.958\nThey named her Annie,\n\n00:06:22.958 --> 00:06:24.958\nand they began tracking her movements.\n\n00:06:24.958 --> 00:06:26.958\nThe herd was safe within the confines of the park,\n\n00:06:26.958 --> 00:06:28.958\nbecause of this dedicated group of park rangers.\n\n00:06:28.958 --> 00:06:32.958\nBut once the annual rains began,\n\n00:06:32.958 --> 00:06:35.958\nthe herd would begin migrating to feeding grounds outside the park.\n\n00:06:35.958 --> 00:06:37.958\nAnd that's when they ran into trouble.\n\n00:06:38.958 --> 00:06:40.958\nFor outside the safety of the park were poachers,\n\n00:06:40.958 --> 00:06:44.958\nwho would hunt them down only for the value of their ivory tusks.\n\n00:06:45.958 --> 00:06:47.958\nThe matriarch that they were radio tracking,\n\n00:06:47.958 --> 00:06:50.958\nafter weeks of moving back and forth, in and out of the park,\n\n00:06:50.958 --> 00:06:52.958\ncame to a halt outside the park.\n\n00:06:52.958 --> 00:06:57.958\nAnnie had been killed, along with 20 members of her herd.\n\n00:07:00.958 --> 00:07:02.958\nAnd they only came for the ivory.\n\n00:07:06.958 --> 00:07:08.958\nThis is actually one of the rangers.\n\n00:07:08.958 --> 00:07:11.958\nThey were able to chase off one of the poachers and recover this ivory,\n\n00:07:11.958 --> 00:07:13.958\nbecause they couldn't leave it there,\n\n00:07:13.958 --> 00:07:15.958\nbecause it's still valuable.\n\n00:07:15.958 --> 00:07:17.958\nBut what Nick did was he brought back\n\n00:07:17.958 --> 00:07:21.958\na story that went beyond the old-school method\n\n00:07:21.958 --> 00:07:23.958\nof just straight, \"Isn't this an amazing world?\"\n\n00:07:23.958 --> 00:07:27.958\nAnd instead, created a story that touched our audiences deeply.\n\n00:07:27.958 --> 00:07:29.958\nInstead of just knowledge of this park,\n\n00:07:29.958 --> 00:07:31.958\nhe created an understanding and an empathy\n\n00:07:31.958 --> 00:07:33.958\nfor the elephants, the rangers and the many issues\n\n00:07:33.958 --> 00:07:36.958\nsurrounding human-wildlife conflicts.\n\n00:07:37.958 --> 00:07:39.958\nNow let's go over to India.\n\n00:07:39.958 --> 00:07:42.958\nSometimes you can tell a broad story in a focused way.\n\n00:07:42.958 --> 00:07:45.958\nWe were looking at the same issue that Richard Wurman\n\n00:07:45.958 --> 00:07:48.958\ntouches upon in his new world population project.\n\n00:07:48.958 --> 00:07:50.958\nFor the first time in history,\n\n00:07:50.958 --> 00:07:54.958\nmore people live in urban, rather than rural, environments.\n\n00:07:54.958 --> 00:07:56.958\nAnd most of that growth is not in the cities,\n\n00:07:56.958 --> 00:07:58.958\nbut in the slums that surround them.\n\n00:07:59.958 --> 00:08:02.958\nJonas Bendiksen, a very energetic photographer,\n\n00:08:02.958 --> 00:08:04.958\ncame to me and said,\n\n00:08:04.958 --> 00:08:07.958\n\"We need to document this, and here's my proposal.\n\n00:08:07.958 --> 00:08:10.958\nLet's go all over the world and photograph every single slum around the world.\"\n\n00:08:10.958 --> 00:08:13.958\nAnd I said, \"Well, you know, that might be a bit ambitious for our budget.\"\n\n00:08:13.958 --> 00:08:15.958\nSo instead, what we did was\n\n00:08:15.958 --> 00:08:18.958\nwe decided to, instead of going out and doing what would result\n\n00:08:18.958 --> 00:08:20.958\nin what we'd consider sort of a survey story --\n\n00:08:20.958 --> 00:08:23.958\nwhere you just go in and see just a little bit of everything --\n\n00:08:23.958 --> 00:08:26.958\nwe put Jonas into Dharavi,\n\n00:08:26.958 --> 00:08:28.958\nwhich is part of Mumbai, India,\n\n00:08:28.958 --> 00:08:30.958\nand let him stay there, and really get into\n\n00:08:30.958 --> 00:08:36.958\nthe heart and soul of this really major part of the city.\n\n00:08:37.958 --> 00:08:39.958\nWhat Jonas did was not just go and do a surface look\n\n00:08:39.958 --> 00:08:42.958\nat the awful conditions that exist in such places.\n\n00:08:42.958 --> 00:08:45.958\nHe saw that this was a living and breathing and vital part\n\n00:08:45.958 --> 00:08:47.958\nof how the entire urban area functioned.\n\n00:08:48.958 --> 00:08:50.958\nBy staying tightly focused in one place,\n\n00:08:50.958 --> 00:08:53.958\nJonas tapped into the soul and the enduring human spirit\n\n00:08:53.958 --> 00:08:55.958\nthat underlies this community.\n\n00:08:57.958 --> 00:08:59.958\nAnd he did it in a beautiful way.\n\n00:09:02.958 --> 00:09:05.958\nSometimes, though, the only way to tell a story is with a sweeping picture.\n\n00:09:05.958 --> 00:09:08.958\nWe teamed up underwater photographer Brian Skerry\n\n00:09:08.958 --> 00:09:10.958\nand photojournalist Randy Olson\n\n00:09:10.958 --> 00:09:13.958\nto document the depletion of the world's fisheries.\n\n00:09:13.958 --> 00:09:16.958\nWe weren't the only ones to tackle this subject,\n\n00:09:16.958 --> 00:09:19.958\nbut the photographs that Brian and Randy created\n\n00:09:19.958 --> 00:09:21.958\nare among the best to capture both the human\n\n00:09:21.958 --> 00:09:23.958\nand natural devastation of overfishing.\n\n00:09:23.958 --> 00:09:25.958\nHere, in a photo by Brian,\n\n00:09:25.958 --> 00:09:28.958\na seemingly crucified shark is caught up\n\n00:09:28.958 --> 00:09:30.958\nin a gill net off of Baja.\n\n00:09:30.958 --> 00:09:33.958\nI've seen sort of OK pictures of bycatch,\n\n00:09:33.958 --> 00:09:35.958\nthe animals accidentally scooped up\n\n00:09:35.958 --> 00:09:37.958\nwhile fishing for a specific species.\n\n00:09:37.958 --> 00:09:39.958\nBut here, Brian captured a unique view\n\n00:09:39.958 --> 00:09:42.958\nby positioning himself underneath the boat\n\n00:09:42.958 --> 00:09:46.958\nwhen they threw the waste overboard.\n\n00:09:48.958 --> 00:09:50.958\nAnd Brian then went on to even greater risk\n\n00:09:50.958 --> 00:09:52.958\nto get this never-before-made photograph\n\n00:09:52.958 --> 00:09:54.958\nof a trawl net scraping the ocean bottom.\n\n00:09:57.958 --> 00:09:59.958\nBack on land, Randy Olson photographed\n\n00:09:59.958 --> 00:10:01.958\na makeshift fish market in Africa,\n\n00:10:01.958 --> 00:10:04.958\nwhere the remains of filleted fish were sold to the locals,\n\n00:10:04.958 --> 00:10:07.958\nthe main parts having already been sent to Europe.\n\n00:10:07.958 --> 00:10:10.958\nAnd here in China, Randy shot a jellyfish market.\n\n00:10:11.958 --> 00:10:13.958\nAs prime food sources are depleted,\n\n00:10:13.958 --> 00:10:15.958\nthe harvest goes deeper into the oceans\n\n00:10:15.958 --> 00:10:17.958\nand brings in more such sources of protein.\n\n00:10:17.958 --> 00:10:20.958\nThis is called fishing down the food chain.\n\n00:10:20.958 --> 00:10:22.958\nBut there are also glimmers of hope,\n\n00:10:22.958 --> 00:10:25.958\nand I think anytime we're doing a big, big story on this,\n\n00:10:25.958 --> 00:10:27.958\nwe don't really want to go\n\n00:10:27.958 --> 00:10:29.958\nand just look at all the problems.\n\n00:10:29.958 --> 00:10:30.958\nWe also want to look for solutions.\n\n00:10:30.958 --> 00:10:34.958\nBrian photographed a marine sanctuary in New Zealand,\n\n00:10:34.958 --> 00:10:36.958\nwhere commercial fishing had been banned --\n\n00:10:36.958 --> 00:10:40.958\nthe result being that the overfished species have been restored,\n\n00:10:40.958 --> 00:10:43.958\nand with them a possible solution for sustainable fisheries.\n\n00:10:43.958 --> 00:10:46.958\nPhotography can also compel us to confront\n\n00:10:46.958 --> 00:10:49.958\nissues that are potentially distressing and controversial.\n\n00:10:49.958 --> 00:10:53.958\nJames Nachtwey, who was honored at last year's TED,\n\n00:10:53.958 --> 00:10:55.958\ntook a look at the sweep of the medical system\n\n00:10:55.958 --> 00:10:58.958\nthat is utilized to handle the American wounded coming out of Iraq.\n\n00:10:58.958 --> 00:11:01.958\nIt is like a tube where a wounded soldier enters on one end\n\n00:11:01.958 --> 00:11:04.958\nand exits back home, on the other.\n\n00:11:04.958 --> 00:11:06.958\nJim started in the battlefield.\n\n00:11:06.958 --> 00:11:10.958\nHere, a medical technician tends to a wounded soldier\n\n00:11:10.958 --> 00:11:12.958\non the helicopter ride back to the field hospital.\n\n00:11:13.958 --> 00:11:15.958\nHere is in the field hospital.\n\n00:11:15.958 --> 00:11:18.958\nThe soldier on the right has the name of his daughter\n\n00:11:18.958 --> 00:11:21.958\ntattooed across his chest, as a reminder of home.\n\n00:11:21.958 --> 00:11:25.958\nFrom here, the more severely wounded are transported\n\n00:11:25.958 --> 00:11:27.958\nback to Germany, where they meet up with their families\n\n00:11:27.958 --> 00:11:29.958\nfor the first time.\n\n00:11:32.958 --> 00:11:36.958\nAnd then back to the States to recuperate at veterans' hospitals,\n\n00:11:36.958 --> 00:11:38.958\nsuch as here in Walter Reed.\n\n00:11:38.958 --> 00:11:40.958\nAnd finally, often fitted with high-tech prosthesis,\n\n00:11:40.958 --> 00:11:42.958\nthey exit the medical system and attempt\n\n00:11:42.958 --> 00:11:44.958\nto regain their pre-war lives.\n\n00:11:44.958 --> 00:11:47.958\nJim took what could have been a straight-up medical science story\n\n00:11:47.958 --> 00:11:51.958\nand gave it a human dimension that touched our readers deeply.\n\n00:11:53.958 --> 00:11:55.958\nNow, these stories are great examples\n\n00:11:55.958 --> 00:11:57.958\nof how photography can be used\n\n00:11:57.958 --> 00:12:00.958\nto address some of our most important topics.\n\n00:12:00.958 --> 00:12:02.958\nBut there are also times when photographers\n\n00:12:02.958 --> 00:12:04.958\nsimply encounter things that are, when it comes down to it,\n\n00:12:04.958 --> 00:12:06.958\njust plain fun.\n\n00:12:06.958 --> 00:12:08.958\nPhotographer Paul Nicklin traveled to Antarctica\n\n00:12:08.958 --> 00:12:10.958\nto shoot a story on leopard seals.\n\n00:12:10.958 --> 00:12:13.958\nThey have been rarely photographed, partly because they are considered\n\n00:12:13.958 --> 00:12:15.958\none of the most dangerous predators in the ocean.\n\n00:12:16.958 --> 00:12:18.958\nIn fact, a year earlier, a researcher had been\n\n00:12:18.958 --> 00:12:20.958\ngrabbed by one and pulled down to depth and killed.\n\n00:12:20.958 --> 00:12:22.958\nSo you can imagine Paul was maybe a little bit hesitant\n\n00:12:22.958 --> 00:12:24.958\nabout getting into the water.\n\n00:12:25.958 --> 00:12:28.958\nNow, what leopard seals do mostly is, they eat penguins.\n\n00:12:28.958 --> 00:12:30.958\nYou know of \"The March of the Penguins.\"\n\n00:12:30.958 --> 00:12:32.958\nThis is sort of the munch of the penguins.\n\n00:12:32.958 --> 00:12:34.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:12:35.958 --> 00:12:38.958\nHere a penguin goes up to the edge and looks out\n\n00:12:38.958 --> 00:12:40.958\nto see if the coast is clear.\n\n00:12:40.958 --> 00:12:43.958\nAnd then everybody kind of runs out and goes out.\n\n00:12:46.958 --> 00:12:48.958\nBut then Paul got in the water.\n\n00:12:48.958 --> 00:12:51.958\nAnd he said he was never really afraid of this.\n\n00:12:51.958 --> 00:12:53.958\nWell, this one female came up to him.\n\n00:12:53.958 --> 00:12:56.958\nShe's probably -- it's a shame you can't see it in the photograph,\n\n00:12:56.958 --> 00:12:58.958\nbut she's 12 feet long.\n\n00:12:58.958 --> 00:13:00.958\nSo, she is pretty significant in size.\n\n00:13:01.958 --> 00:13:02.958\nAnd Paul said he was never really afraid,\n\n00:13:02.958 --> 00:13:05.958\nbecause she was more curious about him than threatened.\n\n00:13:05.958 --> 00:13:07.958\nThis mouthing behavior, on the right,\n\n00:13:07.958 --> 00:13:10.958\nwas really her way of saying to him, \"Hey, look how big I am!\"\n\n00:13:10.958 --> 00:13:13.958\nOr you know, \"My, what big teeth you have.\"\n\n00:13:13.958 --> 00:13:14.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:13:14.958 --> 00:13:16.958\nThen Paul thinks that she simply took pity on him.\n\n00:13:16.958 --> 00:13:20.958\nTo her, here was this big, goofy creature in the water\n\n00:13:20.958 --> 00:13:22.958\nthat for some reason didn't seem to be interested\n\n00:13:22.958 --> 00:13:24.958\nin chasing penguins.\n\n00:13:24.958 --> 00:13:28.958\nSo what she did was she started to bring penguins to him,\n\n00:13:28.958 --> 00:13:31.958\nalive, and put them in front of him.\n\n00:13:31.958 --> 00:13:34.958\nShe dropped them off, and then they would swim away.\n\n00:13:34.958 --> 00:13:36.958\nShe'd kind of look at him, like \"What are you doing?\"\n\n00:13:36.958 --> 00:13:39.958\nGo back and get them, and then bring them back\n\n00:13:39.958 --> 00:13:41.958\nand drop them in front of him.\n\n00:13:41.958 --> 00:13:44.958\nAnd she did this over the course of a couple of days,\n\n00:13:44.958 --> 00:13:46.958\nuntil the point where she got so frustrated with him\n\n00:13:46.958 --> 00:13:49.958\nthat she started putting them directly on top of his head.\n\n00:13:49.958 --> 00:13:51.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:13:51.958 --> 00:13:54.958\nWhich just resulted in a fantastic photograph.\n\n00:13:54.958 --> 00:13:57.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:13:57.958 --> 00:14:00.958\nEventually, though, Paul thinks that she just figured\n\n00:14:00.958 --> 00:14:02.958\nthat he was never going to survive.\n\n00:14:02.958 --> 00:14:05.958\nThis is her just puffing out, you know,\n\n00:14:05.958 --> 00:14:07.958\nsnorting out in disgust.\n\n00:14:07.958 --> 00:14:09.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:14:09.958 --> 00:14:12.958\nAnd lost interest with him, and went back to what she does best.\n\n00:14:12.958 --> 00:14:14.958\nPaul set out to photograph a relatively\n\n00:14:14.958 --> 00:14:16.958\nmysterious and unknown creature,\n\n00:14:16.958 --> 00:14:18.958\nand came back with not just a collection of photographs,\n\n00:14:18.958 --> 00:14:21.958\nbut an amazing experience and a great story.\n\n00:14:22.958 --> 00:14:24.958\nIt is these kinds of stories,\n\n00:14:24.958 --> 00:14:27.958\nones that go beyond the immediate or just the superficial\n\n00:14:27.958 --> 00:14:29.958\nthat demonstrate the power of photojournalism.\n\n00:14:30.958 --> 00:14:35.958\nI believe that photography can make a real connection to people,\n\n00:14:35.958 --> 00:14:38.958\nand can be employed as a positive agent\n\n00:14:38.958 --> 00:14:40.958\nfor understanding the challenges and opportunities\n\n00:14:40.958 --> 00:14:42.958\nfacing our world today.\n\n00:14:42.958 --> 00:14:43.958\nThank you.\n\n00:14:43.958 --> 00:14:47.958\n(Applause)"}, {"title": "Close-up card magic with a twist", "duration": "1868", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/lennart_green_does_close_up_card_magic", "transcript": "My favorite topic is shortcuts. The master of shortcuts \u2014 it's, of course, nature. But I will demonstrate different ways to get rid of difficulties and go to the point, to find an answer probably much quicker than Arthur did. So, first, we violate the common sense, the logic. All of you, if you hold your hand like this, 90 degrees \u2014 all of you. Not you. All of you, right? Palm up. If you do this, the common, the logic says you must turn the wrist. Do you agree? Good. But I will first teach you a method, how you can do it without moving the wrist, and then the shortcut. You can do it immediately, right? Hold the hand like this, palm up. Don't move the wrist. The wrist is \u2014 I doesn't speak very many, but I do the best, what I are. Right-molded you say, with iron? That was a joke, actually, and I \u2014 OK. Hold the hand palm up. Do this, don't move the wrist. Over the heart, don't move the wrist. Forward, don't move the wrist. Up, don't move the wrist. Over the heart, don't move the wrist. And forward. Yeah. Now \u2014 (Laughter) \u2014 logic, logically, you have got to this position from this, without moving the wrist. (Laughter) Now, the shortcut. (Laughter) But it was six moves. Now with one move. I start here, palm down, you can follow. And then look at me. Yeah! (Laughter) One move. OK. So, that was the warming up.Now, I need an assistant. I talked to a nice girl before, Zoe. She has left. No! A big hand. (Applause)Good. Nice. And you can sit over there. One item here was water, right? And I will give my tribute to water. I think it's enough with water for me. The other guys can talk about \u2014 cheers. (Laughter) Beer has about \u2014 there's a lot of water in beer. (Laughter)So, now I will demonstrate different ways of memorizing, control cards and so on. And I think I'll take off this one. I work with a special method to do it, quick. I work with precision \u2014 oh, sorry \u2014 control and a very powerful ... memory system, right? (Laughter) So, if \u2014 I have studied the poker. I like to gamble. Officially, I don't gamble but ... So, if we are \u2014 if we have five person, and I will do a five-handed poker game.Now I will interact. So a different person all the time, so not the same person can answer. So we have an agreement. Which one shall have a good poker hand? Which number? One, two, three, four or five? (Audience: Three.)Lennart Green: Three \u2014 good. And here, I had a mat here to make it a little \u2014 the critical moment is \u2014 sorry. If a card shark gathers the cards together, immediately when he \u2014 before he deals the card. Now, so I think, number three, I have arranged them in a full house. (Laughter) With queens and \u2014 it's OK \u2014 queens and tens. That's a challenge. I like this. I will explain later. One, two, three, four, five. I start with three queens. So here you see the contrast when I treat the cards. And two tens. Yeah. Thank you. (Applause) But also the other hand is good, if all the other guys have good hands too. So these guys have actually a stronger hand \u2014 three aces and two kings. This guy beats them with four of a kind, or deuce \u2014 deuce. No reaction? That with even \u2014 OK, and this. These look in order, I'm probably \u2014 hopefully \u2014 yeah. Three, four, five, six, seven and ... But, of course, I will have the winning hand. Ten, jack, queen, king, ace. Yeah. So, good. (Laughter) So the hand that looks so good from the beginning, number three, at the end was actually the lowest hand. Such life. Right?So, please mix them. Now, if you are interested, I will demonstrate some underground techniques. Yes? I work with kind of estimation, shuffle tracking \u2014 ah, good. Impressive. Thank you. (Laughter)So, first, the first term is estimation. Here, I can estimate exactly how many cards are put between my royal flush. Of course, I can count the cards, but this is much quicker. Right? You agree. So here I have, actually \u2014 I know exactly where the cards are. So here, I can make a bet, and this is actually one of the points where I get my money. So here: 10, jack, queen, king, ace. OK. (Applause)Next is a term \u2014 I do it quick. I call this stealing. So here, I think I know about where the cards are. I will spread the cards and you'll say stop, when I point to them, right. Point, say stop.Zoe: Stop.LG: Here \u2014 you see some are missing? And that's the stealing cards, which I did. (Laughter)OK. Now, another term called shuffle tracking. Shuffle tracking means I keep track of the cards, even if another person shuffles. This is a little risky. So \u2014 because if you look, now, I can still see it. You agree? But if you square \u2014 square, and shuffle, and then a cut. So here, to follow my cards, I must look at the shuffle from the begin \u2014 ah, we are started together. It's OK, it's OK. Come to \u2014 no, no, no, no. I'm joking, yeah? Any style \u2014 yeah, good. Here I have to calculate, but actually, I don't like to calculate. I work direct with the right brain. If you pass the left brain, you have to take care of logic and common sense. Direct in the right brain, that's much better. And so \u2014 (Laughter) \u2014 Arthur Benjamin did a little of the same thing. And if you work with, in the right atmosphere, with humor, you have \u2014 that's the password to the cosmic bank of knowledge, where you can find any solution of any problem.OK. Now, I drop the cards, and you say stop anyway, right? Not at the last card.Zoe: Stop. LG: Yeah.When I'm sober, I do this much quicker, but we will check. (Laughter) Ah, not in order, it \u2014 that was a mistake. No, I'm kidding. (Applause) No, now and then I put in a mistake, just to emphasize how difficult it is. Right? Yeah, last night I forgot that. That was a mistake. But now I'm glad I remember it. So, this deck is bought here. Sorry. I have a little pad to make it a little softer. This deck is bought here in America. It's called \"Bicycle.\" And this deck is very flexible, but not so many people know, if you check, if you press at the right spots, you see how thin and flexible this deck is, right? Now, you can carry this in your wallet, so ... You don't see it, make no reaction? (Laughter) So, but here, and \u2014 is the camera getting too much? No. (Laughter)Yeah? (Audience: It's getting too much.)LG: Pardon? But then, when we will have it back, you do this. But not too much. Then you have to push it down again. Here, please. If you push these heaps \u2014 everyone see \u2014 push them together so they are really interlaced, right? Yeah, good. Perfect. Just push them through, good. Thank you. And then, I will demonstrate a thing from Russian satellite, stealen \u2014 stolen, probably copied from America but we will see.Here \u2014 shortcuts. I talk about shortcuts. Now I go very quick through the deck and try to find some pattern. The new chaos theory is already old, right? But you know, I think you are familiar with fractals \u2014 the Mandelbrot spirals and all these things. And it's much easier to memorize cards in a pattern way, and not concentrate. If you concentrate and calculate, then you go to \u2014 then it's the left brain. But if you just look and talk in another language ... Yeah, great. I think I have it.So now, different persons, older, tap. Please name any card, anyone.(Audience: Jack of spades.) LG: Jack of spades.Jack of spades. I think jack of spades is number 12 from the top. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10, 11, 12. Yes, right. So \u2014 oh, jack of spades.You said spades? (Audience: Yes.) LG: Ah. My fault. Don't applaud, this was clubs. So, jack of spades. I think ... 23 \u2014 24, sorry, 24. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23 \u2014 ah, 25, yes. It's the last. Now, I do it quicker, better. OK. Another person. Oh, I forgot, I shouldn't shuffle but I think \u2014 (Laughter) \u2014 actually, my technique is to peek, all the time. When I lift the heap, I peek. You see, yeah, perfect. Three, four, five, six. Then I calculate \u2014 yeah, good. (Laughter)Another person, another card. (Audience: Seven of diamonds.)LG: Seven of diamonds. Perfect, my favorite, yeah, seven. So I will do it quick, very quick, but in slow motion, so you can follow. (Laughter)Seven of? (Audience: Diamonds.)LG: Diamonds, good. I start here. Good, thank you. (Applause) The thing I did \u2014 I peeked. I know where the card were, then I chose it. So another person, another card. (Laughter) Another person.(Audience: Ten of diamonds.) LG: Pardon? (Audience: Ten of diamonds.)LG: Ten of diamonds, yeah. I think I do it the same way. I like to, so I know where it is. Ten of diamonds. But now I do it the regular speed, right? Ten of diamonds. Good. Maybe you will cut? Lift. Excellent. So, thank you. Another person, another card.(Audience: Five of clubs.)LG: Pardon? (Audience: Five of clubs.)LG: Five of clubs. It's not the same person, even if it's the same spot. We can take some over there later. So now, I will drop the cards. And you'll say stop, anywhere. Got it? Five of clubs. Not the last. Yes, that's difficult to find a card here. (Laughter) We do it again. The person who said five of clubs say stop, when the cards are in the air, right?(Audience: Stop.)LG: Very good. OK. (Applause)OK, I had to use a little force there. I think we save five of clubs. And now a card with a contrast of five of clubs.(Audience: Queen of hearts.) LG: Queen of hearts, yeah. Excellent. I love that card. Here, I will do the most difficult thing. For example, you are sitting in Las Vegas, and you're betting, and you let the other guys peek this card by mistake. Feel, it's just the regular, one card. And now, when I lift this card, it shall be your card. What was your card?(Audience: Queen of hearts.)LG: Queen of? Queen of hearts. So that's a tough challenge, right? So here, I grab \u2014 you know this? Five of clubs ... and queen of hearts. Yes! This is a tough one, because here I must take advantage of \u2014 I switch it with the five of clubs. So, now a false count. Which card shall I use? Queen or five?Zoe: The queen. LG: Queen, yes.So, I use the queen, and here's five of clubs. The false count \u2014 and the number one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight \u2014 you say the same card all the time. Eight, nine, 10. This is a kind of optical deal, right? When I put one card at a table \u2014 look, it's not one card. It's \u2014 look, it's a bunch of cards that gives this impression. Yeah. Now some hard stuff. I think we keep the queen here, yes. Now, to the satellites things. This \u2014 oh sorry, don't look at the beam. My fault. (Laughter)This is high-frequency laser, and it's enough with a fraction of a second to destroy the retina completely. Right, sorry, my \u2014 I should have mentioned that, yeah. But you can relax, because it takes half an hour before it works, so you have plenty of time to see my whole performance. (Laughter) Now, I put the laser here, and \u2014 now, when I deal the cards in the laser, I know where they are but \u2014 yes? Did the camera got it? No? They didn't? What happened?(Audience: It disappeared.)LG: OK, I'll take another group. Do the cameras see the cards now?No? (Audience: No, they're all gone.)LG: But you see the hand. Ah, good, good, good. But now. So now, that was the reason, right? You see the cards? Yes. (Laughter) Yeah, good. Now \u2014 (Laughter) \u2014 one guy laughed. So now, to find the queen, do it this way: take back the other one, take back the queen. (Laughter) Yeah, interesting, but a little dangerous. (Laughter) I liked it. Now, a little more difficult. Name \u2014 anyone, name, please, any suit.(Audience: Spades.) LG: Spades? Spades, good.So here, here I have to peek, lots of cards. I think there are lots of \u2014 I don't know how many \u2014 but 10, 15 spades in a deck, at least, right? (Laughter) So every time I lift the heap, I peek, right. Then I arrange them so I can get them quick. Perfect, excellent. So I start with the ace \u2014 yeah, ace. Ah, yeah \u2014 spades? Same mistake as before, right? So \u2014 I arrange the spades \u2014 the clubs. I try to do this right here. First, I take the spades. You see, I don't work with prestige, so always do mistakes. It doesn't matter to me. And now and then, I get some extra sympathy points, right? One, two, three, four \u2014 yes, the camera got it? Five, six, seven, eight \u2014 ah \u2014 nine, 10, the jack, jack of spades, queen of \u2014 I like that laugh, yeah! Good. Queen. (Laughter) Wait, wait, wait \u2014 please take any card. Grab any one. Quick, quick, good. And we switch this to the king. Ace of diamonds. And now, look, ace of diamonds will guide. So I find ... king of spades. There was the place. And here is king of spades, correct? Yeah? OK. (Applause)Now, a little more difficult thing. Maybe you think I have the cards in order already, so you help me to shuffle again. Another suit, please.(Audience: Armani.) LG: Pardon? (Audience: Armani.) (Laughter)LG: It was after the blindfold. I like this guy, yeah. OK. That should be my end effect, but OK. Armani \u2014 who said Armani? You? I drop the cards and you \u2014 which size? Which size? It's a piece of cake. I like challenges. Which size?(Audience: Extra large.) LG: Extra large, OK.Say stop. (Audience: Stop.) (Laughter)LG: Yeah, Armani. OK. (Applause) Ah, this is tough. OK, a suit. I had clubs before, spades.Another suit. (Audience: Diamonds.) LG: Diamonds, perfect.So, in this case, I try to locate diamonds. I look at the cards, and OK. We try. Yeah. You help me. If I drop the card face up, like this, you reverse it. Zoe: OK. LG: OK, now. Do with both hands, and quick. Yes, good, good. (Laughter) I think we have it now. Yeah, good, good. So here, diamonds, hearts \u2014 no, diamonds. Good, good. Stop. Do you see the pattern? No? Now? Yes, yes, OK. I work with pattern. Oh sorry, I dropped one. Maybe it's important \u2014 yeah \u2014 nine of diamonds, OK. So now \u2014 I always ask, why do I put myself in this position? I have to figure out so many outs, when I miss some cards, but I love it. So now, I will do it. I will try to find the diamonds, but I will do it the hard way. It's too easy to do it right away, right? I think I will do it ... blindfolded. At this distance, it works immediately. Aargh! (Laughter)Duct tape. I look \u2014 shake the cards, so I don't. Go ahead. Yeah, good. I like the empathy. Empathy. But it was \u2014 did you hear? It was women's voice. Hear the guy \u2014 yeah, more, more, more. (Laughter) Yeah, good. Yeah. You can take the nostril too, because some guys think \u2014 (Laughter) \u2014 some guys think I can peek through the nostril, so do more. Go, go. Right? Good. Satisfied? Looks good, like Batman. Ow! (Laughter) No, with dignity and elegance, right? But I like her, yeah. I said, be a little tough. And it was OK. One more? The last. OK. All right.Now you must agree that I'm \u2014 I must rely on other senses, right? I work with vibration. So, what was the card? Diamonds. Ah, I memorized hearts. So now I have to improvise again. Maybe I'll stand up. Half. Diamonds \u2014 I'll start with ace of diamonds. Just kidding, warming up \u2014 king of hearts. (Laughter) And I give you a diamonds, so they \u2014 so you put them here, in a nice row, right. And you can see, yeah? Good. Ace of diamonds, yes? Zoe: Yeah.LG: Good. Good. Two \u2014 (Applause) \u2014 thank you. I never ever miss two. This is interesting. Always I've found two, but the wrong color. Spades, sorry. And the deck is a gift to you after, so let the skepticals here, in this, examine them, right? Remind me. It's a gift. Two \u2014 and it was two of spades, right? Sorry, two of diamonds. I'll do it quick now. Three \u2014 three of diamonds. Yes! Four \u2014 I like challenges, yes. Yeah, good.Chris Anderson: You're peeking.LG: Pardon?CA: You're peeking. You just got to \u2014 this is a request from the lady in the back. (Laughter)Okay. Try that. LG: Yeah. Also listen. OK, now. This is maybe a little tough. We will try. Yes? Good? (Laughter) OK. So, how many cards? Five? Zoe: Four.LG: Four. Is five the next card?Zoe: Five of diamonds, yeah.LG: It's not here? Zoe: It's not there.LG: Oh. So here, all the cards are face down \u2014 you agree? (Audience: Yes.)LG: Yes? You see that in the screen? And this is face up, and it's not at the bottom here. So next card will be \u2014 was it five?Zoe: Five. LG: Yeah \u2014 I will reverse it face up here.Yes? Zoe: Yeah. LG: Six \u2014 six with the thumb. Seven. Yeah, I do this. I know where it is, because I peeked before and then I do this. Right? Eight. If \u2014 and then nine, right? Yeah. Yesterday \u2014 the day before yesterday, I was in Vegas, and I used this actually. Nine? Yeah? Correct? No? Yes! Ah, good, good. Ten \u2014 once again, I love this Jonny Wayne move. Yeah. Jack \u2014 you [unclear] with Jack? Jack of diamonds, correct? (Audience: No.)LG: Yes? And queen! Queen, with misdirection. Misdirection. (Applause) Yeah? And then, king, after exactly five seconds. Yeah. Five. Five seconds. One, two, three, four \u2014 mmm! Check it. Yes?CA: King of diamonds. LG: Ah! Good. Oh.

So a different person\n\n00:04:17.958 --> 00:04:20.958\nall the time, so not the same person can answer.\n\n00:04:20.958 --> 00:04:23.958\nSo we have an agreement.\n\n00:04:23.958 --> 00:04:25.958\nWhich one shall have a good poker hand?\n\n00:04:25.958 --> 00:04:27.958\nWhich number?

(Audience: Three.)\n\n00:04:27.958 --> 00:04:29.958\nLennart Green: Three -- good.\n\n00:04:29.958 --> 00:04:31.958\nAnd\n\n00:04:31.958 --> 00:04:33.958\nhere,\n\n00:04:33.958 --> 00:04:35.958\nI had a mat here to make it a little --\n\n00:04:35.958 --> 00:04:38.958\nthe critical moment is -- sorry.\n\n00:04:41.958 --> 00:04:44.958\nIf a card shark gathers the cards together,\n\n00:04:44.958 --> 00:04:47.958\nimmediately when he --\n\n00:04:47.958 --> 00:04:50.958\nbefore he deals the card. Now,\n\n00:04:50.958 --> 00:04:53.958\nso I think, number three,\n\n00:04:53.958 --> 00:04:56.958\nI have arranged them in a full house.\n\n00:04:56.958 --> 00:04:57.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:04:57.958 --> 00:05:00.958\nWith queens and -- it's OK --\n\n00:05:02.958 --> 00:05:05.958\nqueens and tens.\n\n00:05:08.958 --> 00:05:10.958\nThat's a challenge. I like this.\n\n00:05:10.958 --> 00:05:14.958\nI will explain later. One, two, three, four, five.\n\n00:05:14.958 --> 00:05:17.958\nI start with three queens.\n\n00:05:17.958 --> 00:05:20.958\nSo here you see the contrast when I treat the cards.\n\n00:05:22.958 --> 00:05:24.958\nAnd two tens.\n\n00:05:24.958 --> 00:05:27.958\nYeah.

That with even --\n\n00:05:52.958 --> 00:05:54.958\nOK, and this.\n\n00:05:54.958 --> 00:05:57.958\nThese look in order, I'm probably -- hopefully --\n\n00:05:57.958 --> 00:06:01.958\nyeah. Three, four, five, six, seven\n\n00:06:02.958 --> 00:06:04.958\nand ...\n\n00:06:04.958 --> 00:06:06.958\nBut, of course, I will have the winning hand.\n\n00:06:07.958 --> 00:06:09.958\nTen, jack,\n\n00:06:09.958 --> 00:06:11.958\nqueen, king, ace.\n\n00:06:11.958 --> 00:06:13.958\nYeah. So,\n\n00:06:14.958 --> 00:06:16.958\ngood.\n\n00:06:16.958 --> 00:06:20.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:06:20.958 --> 00:06:23.958\nSo the hand that looks so good from the beginning,\n\n00:06:23.958 --> 00:06:25.958\nnumber three, at the end\n\n00:06:25.958 --> 00:06:27.958\nwas actually the lowest hand.\n\n00:06:27.958 --> 00:06:30.958\nSuch life. Right?\n\n00:06:30.958 --> 00:06:32.958\nSo, please mix them.\n\n00:06:32.958 --> 00:06:36.958\nNow, if you are interested, I will demonstrate some\n\n00:06:36.958 --> 00:06:39.958\nunderground techniques.\n\n00:06:39.958 --> 00:06:41.958\nYes?\n\n00:06:41.958 --> 00:06:44.958\nI work with\n\n00:06:44.958 --> 00:06:47.958\nkind of estimation,\n\n00:06:47.958 --> 00:06:49.958\nshuffle tracking --\n\n00:06:49.958 --> 00:06:51.958\nah, good.\n\n00:06:51.958 --> 00:06:54.958\nImpressive.

You agree.\n\n00:07:13.958 --> 00:07:16.958\nSo here I have, actually --\n\n00:07:16.958 --> 00:07:18.958\nI know exactly where the cards are.\n\n00:07:18.958 --> 00:07:20.958\nSo here, I can make a bet,\n\n00:07:20.958 --> 00:07:22.958\nand this is actually one of the points where I get my money.\n\n00:07:22.958 --> 00:07:25.958\nSo here: 10, jack,\n\n00:07:25.958 --> 00:07:28.958\nqueen, king, ace.\n\n00:07:29.958 --> 00:07:31.958\nOK.\n\n00:07:31.958 --> 00:07:33.958\n(Applause)\n\n00:07:34.958 --> 00:07:36.958\nNext\n\n00:07:36.958 --> 00:07:39.958\nis a term --\n\n00:07:39.958 --> 00:07:42.958\nI do it quick. I call this stealing.\n\n00:07:45.958 --> 00:07:47.958\nSo here, I think\n\n00:07:47.958 --> 00:07:49.958\nI know about where the cards are.\n\n00:07:49.958 --> 00:07:51.958\nI will spread the cards and you'll say stop,\n\n00:07:51.958 --> 00:07:54.958\nwhen I point to them, right. Point, say stop.\n\n00:07:54.958 --> 00:07:55.958\nZoe: Stop.\n\n00:07:55.958 --> 00:07:57.958\nLG: Here -- you see some are missing?\n\n00:07:57.958 --> 00:07:59.958\nAnd that's the stealing cards, which I did.\n\n00:07:59.958 --> 00:08:01.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:08:02.958 --> 00:08:04.958\nOK.\n\n00:08:09.958 --> 00:08:12.958\nNow, another term called shuffle tracking.\n\n00:08:12.958 --> 00:08:15.958\nShuffle tracking means I keep track of the cards,\n\n00:08:16.958 --> 00:08:19.958\neven if another person shuffles.\n\n00:08:19.958 --> 00:08:21.958\nThis is a little risky.\n\n00:08:21.958 --> 00:08:24.958\nSo -- because if you look, now, I can still see it.\n\n00:08:25.958 --> 00:08:28.958\nYou agree? But if you square --\n\n00:08:28.958 --> 00:08:30.958\nsquare, and shuffle,\n\n00:08:31.958 --> 00:08:33.958\nand then a cut.\n\n00:08:33.958 --> 00:08:35.958\nSo here,\n\n00:08:35.958 --> 00:08:38.958\nto follow my cards, I must look at the shuffle from the begin --\n\n00:08:38.958 --> 00:08:41.958\nah, we are started together. It's OK, it's OK.\n\n00:08:41.958 --> 00:08:43.958\nCome to -- no, no, no, no.\n\n00:08:43.958 --> 00:08:45.958\nI'm joking, yeah?\n\n00:08:45.958 --> 00:08:47.958\nAny style -- yeah, good.\n\n00:08:49.958 --> 00:08:52.958\nHere I have to calculate, but actually, I don't like to calculate.\n\n00:08:52.958 --> 00:08:54.958\nI work direct with the right brain.\n\n00:08:54.958 --> 00:08:56.958\nIf you pass the left brain,\n\n00:08:56.958 --> 00:08:59.958\nyou have to take care of logic and common sense.\n\n00:09:00.958 --> 00:09:02.958\nDirect in the right brain, that's much better. And so --\n\n00:09:02.958 --> 00:09:05.958\n(Laughter) --\n\n00:09:05.958 --> 00:09:07.958\nArthur Benjamin did\n\n00:09:07.958 --> 00:09:09.958\na little of the same thing.\n\n00:09:09.958 --> 00:09:12.958\nAnd if you work with, in the right atmosphere, with humor,\n\n00:09:12.958 --> 00:09:14.958\nyou have -- that's the password\n\n00:09:14.958 --> 00:09:16.958\nto the\n\n00:09:16.958 --> 00:09:19.958\ncosmic bank of knowledge,\n\n00:09:19.958 --> 00:09:22.958\nwhere you can find any solution of any problem.\n\n00:09:23.958 --> 00:09:25.958\nOK. Now, I drop the cards,\n\n00:09:25.958 --> 00:09:27.958\nand you say stop anyway, right?\n\n00:09:27.958 --> 00:09:29.958\nNot at the last card.\n\n00:09:29.958 --> 00:09:31.958\nZoe: Stop. LG: Yeah.\n\n00:09:31.958 --> 00:09:34.958\nWhen I'm sober, I do this much quicker, but we will check.\n\n00:09:34.958 --> 00:09:38.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:09:40.958 --> 00:09:43.958\nAh, not in order, it -- that was a mistake.\n\n00:09:43.958 --> 00:09:45.958\nNo, I'm kidding.\n\n00:09:45.958 --> 00:09:51.958\n(Applause)\n\n00:09:51.958 --> 00:09:53.958\nNo, now and then I put in a mistake,\n\n00:09:53.958 --> 00:09:55.958\njust to emphasize how difficult it is.\n\n00:09:55.958 --> 00:09:57.958\nRight?\n\n00:09:58.958 --> 00:10:00.958\nYeah, last night I forgot that. That was a mistake.\n\n00:10:00.958 --> 00:10:02.958\nBut now I'm glad I remember it.\n\n00:10:02.958 --> 00:10:04.958\nSo,\n\n00:10:04.958 --> 00:10:06.958\nthis deck is bought here.

Ow!\n\n00:25:07.958 --> 00:25:09.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:25:10.958 --> 00:25:13.958\nNo, with dignity and elegance, right?\n\n00:25:15.958 --> 00:25:18.958\nBut I like her, yeah.

LG: Okay, thank you."}, {"title": "Dog-friendly dog training", "duration": "886", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/ian_dunbar_on_dog_friendly_dog_training", "transcript": "Dogs have interests. They have interest sniffing each other, chasing squirrels. And if we don't make that a reward in training, that will be a distraction. It's always sort of struck me as really a scary thought that if you see a dog in a park, and the owner is calling it, and the owner says, you know, \"Puppy, come here, come here,\" and the dog thinks, \"Hmm, interesting. I'm sniffing this other dog's rear end, the owner's calling.\" It's a difficult choice, right? Rear end, owner. Rear end wins. I mean, you lose. You cannot compete with the environment, if you have an adolescent dog's brain. So, when we train, we're always trying to take into account the dog's point of view.Now, I'm here largely because there's kind of a rift in dog training at the moment that \u2014 on one side, we have people who think that you train a dog, number one, by making up rules, human rules. We don't take the dog's point of view into account. So the human says, \"You're going to act this way, damn it. We're going to force you to act against your will, to bend to our will.\" Then, number two, we keep these rules a secret from the dog. And then number three, now we can punish the dog for breaking rules he didn't even know existed. So you get a little puppy, he comes. His only crime is he grew. When he was a little puppy, he puts his paws on your leg \u2014 you know, isn't that nice? And you go, \"Oh, there's a good boy.\" You bend down, you pat him \u2014 you reward him for jumping up. His one mistake is he's a Tibetan mastiff, and a few months later, he weighs, you know, 80 pounds. Every time he jumps up, he gets all sorts of abuse. I mean, it is really very, very scary the abuse that dogs get.So, this whole dominance issue \u2014 number one, what we get in dog training is this Mickey-Mouse interpretation of a very complicated social system. And they take this stuff seriously. Male dogs are very serious about a hierarchy, because it prevents physical fights. Of course, female dogs, bitches, on the other hand, have several bitch amendments to male hierarchical rule. The number one is, \"I have it, you don't.\" And what you will find is a very, very low-ranking bitch will quite easily keep a bone away from a high-ranking male. So, we get in dog training this notion of dominances, or of the alpha dog. I'm sure that you've heard this.Dogs get so abused. Dogs, horses and humans \u2014 these are the three species which are so abused in life. And the reason is built into their behavior \u2014 is to always come back and apologize. Like, \"Oh, I'm sorry you had to beat me. I'm really sorry, yes, it's my fault.\" They are just so beatable, and that's why they get beaten. The poor puppy jumps up, you open the dog book, what does it say? \"Hold his front paws, squeeze his front paws, stamp on his hind feet, squirt him in the face with lemon juice, hit him on the head with a rolled-up newspaper, knee him in the chest, flip him over backwards.\" Because he grew? And because he's performing a behavior you've trained him to do? This is insanity. I ask owners, \"Well, how would you like the dog to greet you?\" And people say, \"Well, I don't know, to sit, I guess.\" I said, \"Let's teach him to sit.\" And then we give him a reason for sitting. Because the first stage is basically teaching a dog ESL. I could speak to you and say, \"Laytay-chai, paisey, paisey.\" Go on, something should happen now. Why aren't you responding? Oh, you don't speak Swahili. Well, I've got news for you. The dog doesn't speak English, or American, or Spanish, or French.So the first stage in training is to teach the dog ESL, English as a second language. And that's how we use the food lure in the hand, and we use food because we're dealing with owners. My wife doesn't need food \u2014 she's a great trainer, much better than I am. I don't need food, but the average owner says, \"Puppy, sit.\" Or they go, \"Sit, sit, sit.\" They're making a hand signal in front of the dog's rectum for some reason, like the dog has a third eye there \u2014 it's insane. You know, \"Sit, sit.\" No, we go, \"Puppy, sit\" \u2014 boom, it's got it in six to 10 trials.Then we phase out the food as a lure, and now the dog knows that \"sit\" means sit, and you can actually communicate to a dog in a perfectly constructed English sentence. \"Phoenix, come here, take this, and go to Jamie, please.\" And I've taught her \"Phoenix,\" \"come here,\" \"take this,\" \"go to\" and the name of my son, \"Jamie.\" And the dog can take a note, and I've got my own little search-and-rescue dog. He'll find Jamie wherever he is, you know, wherever kids are, crushing rocks by a stream or something, and take him a little message that says, \"Hey, dinner's ready. Come in for dinner.\"So, at this point, the dog knows what we want it to do. Will it do it? Not necessarily, no. As I said, if he's in the park and there's a rear end to sniff, why come to the owner? The dog lives with you, the dog can get you any time. The dog can sniff your butt, if you like, when he wants to. At the moment, he's in the park, and you are competing with smells, and other dogs, and squirrels.So the second stage in training is to teach the dog to want to do what we want him to do, and this is very easy. We use the Premack principle. Basically, we follow a low-frequency behavior \u2014 one the dog doesn't want to do \u2014 by a high-frequency behavior, commonly known as a behavior problem, or a dog hobby \u2014 something the dog does like to do. That will then become a reward for the lower-frequency behavior. So we go, \"sit,\" on the couch; \"sit,\" tummy-rub; \"sit,\" look, I throw a tennis ball; \"sit,\" say hello to that other dog. Yes, we put \"sniff butt\" on queue. \"Sit,\" sniff butt.So now all of these distractions that worked against training now become rewards that work for training. And what we're doing, in essence, is we're teaching the dog, kind of like \u2014 we're letting the dog think that the dog is training us. And I can imagine this dog, you know, speaking through the fence to, say, an Akita, saying, \"Wow, my owners, they are so incredibly easy to train. They're like Golden Retrievers. All I have to do is sit, and they do everything. They open doors, they drive my car, they massage me, they will throw tennis balls, they will cook for me and serve the food. It's like, if I just sit, that's my command. Then I have my own personal doorman, chauffeur, masseuse, chef and waiter.\" And now the dog's really happy. And this, to me, is always what training is. So we really motivate the dog to want to do it, such that the need for punishment seldom comes up.Now we move to phase three, when now \u2014 there's times, you know, when daddy knows best. And I have a little sign on my fridge, and it says, \"Because I'm the daddy, that's why.\" Sorry, no more explanation. \"I'm the daddy, you're not. Sit.\" And there's times, for example, if my son's friends leave the door open, the dogs have to know you don't step across this line. This is a life-or-death thing. You leave this, the sanctity of your house, and you could be hit on the street. So some things we have to let the dog know, \"You mustn't do this.\"And so we have to enforce, but without force. People here get very confused about what a punishment is. They think a punishment is something nasty. I bet a lot of you do, right? You think it's something painful, or scary, or nasty. It doesn't have to be. There's several definitions of what a punishment is, but one definition, the most popular, is: a punishment is a stimulus that reduces the immediately preceding behavior, such that it's less likely to occur in the future. It does not have to be nasty, scary or painful. And I would say, if it doesn't have to be, then maybe it shouldn't be.I was working with a very dangerous dog about a year ago. And this was a dog that put both his owners in hospital, plus the brother-in-law, plus the child. And I only agreed to work with it if they promised it would stay in their house, and they never took it outside. The dog is actually euthanized now, but this was a dog I worked with for a while. A lot of the aggression happened around the kitchen, so while I was there \u2014 this was on the fourth visit \u2014 we did a four and a half hour down-stay, with the dog on his mat. And he was kept there by the owner's calm insistence. When the dog would try to leave the mat, she would say, \"Rover, on the mat, on the mat, on the mat.\" The dog broke his down-stay 22 times in four and a half hours, while she cooked dinner, because we had a lot of aggression related towards food. The breaks got fewer and fewer. You see, the punishment was working. The behavior problem was going away. She never raised her voice. If she did, she would have got bitten. It's not a good dog you shout at. And a lot of my friends train really neat animals, grizzly bears \u2014 if you've ever seen a grizzly bear on the telly or in film, then it's a friend of mine who's trained it \u2014 killer whales. I love it because it wires you up. How are you going to reprimand a grizzly bear? \"Bad bear, bad bear!\" Voom! Your head now is 100 yards away, sailing through the air, OK? This is crazy.So, where do we go from here? We want a better way. Dogs deserve better. But for me, the reason for this actually has to do with dogs. It has to do with watching people train puppies, and realizing they have horrendous interaction skills, horrendous relationship skills. Not just with their puppy, but with the rest of the family at class. I mean, my all-time classic is another \"come here\" one. You see someone in the park \u2014 and I'll cover my mic when I say this, because I don't want to wake you up \u2014 and there's the owner in the park, and their dog's over here, and they say, \"Rover, come here. Rover, come here. Rover, come here, you son of a bitch.\" The dog says, \"I don't think so.\" (Laughter) I mean, who in their right mind would think that a dog would want to approach them when they're screaming like that? Instead, the dog says, \"I know that tone. I know that tone. Previously, when I've approached, I've gotten punished there.\" I was walking onto a plane \u2014 this, for me, was a pivotal moment in my career, and it really cemented what I wanted to do with this whole puppy-training thing, the notion of how to teach puppies in a dog-friendly way to want to do what we want to do, so we don't have to force them. You know, I puppy-train my child. And the seminal moment was, I was getting on a plane in Dallas, and in row two was a father, I presume, and a young boy about five, kicking the back of the chair. \"Johnny, don't do that.\" Kick, kick, kick. \"Johnny, don't do that.\" Kick, kick, kick. I'm standing right here with my bag. The father leans over, grabs him like this and gives him ugly face. And ugly face is this \u2014 when you go face-to-face with a puppy or a child, you say, \"What are you doing! Now stop it, stop it, stop it!\" And I went, \"Oh my God, do I do something?\" That child has lost everything \u2014 that one of the two people he can trust in this world has absolutely pulled the rug from under his feet. And I thought, \"Do I tell this jerk to quit it?\" I thought, \"Ian, stay out of it, stay out of it, you know, walk on.\" I walked to the back of the plane, I sat down, and a thought came to me. If that had been a dog, I would have laid him out. (Laughter) If he had kicked a dog, I would have punched him out. He kicked a child, grabs the child like this and I let it go.And this is what it's all about. These relationship skills are so easy. I mean, we as humans, our shallowness when we choose a life-mate based on the three Cs \u2014 coat color, conformation, cuteness. You know, kind of like a little robot. This is how we go into a relationship, and it's hunky-dory for a year. And then, a little behavior problem comes up. No different from the dog barking. The husband won't clear up his clothes, or the wife's always late for meetings, whatever it is, OK? And it then starts, and we get into this thing, and our personal feedback \u2014 there's two things about it. When you watch people interacting with animals or other people, there is very little feedback, it's too infrequent. And when it happens, it's bad, it's nasty. You see it's especially in families, especially with spouses, especially with children, especially with parents. You see it especially in the workplace, especially from boss to employee. It's as if there's some schadenfreude there, that we actually take delight in people getting things wrong, so that we can then moan and groan and bitch at them.And this, I would say, is the biggest human foible that we have. It really is. We take the good for granted, and we moan and groan at the bad. And I think this whole notion of these skills should be taught. You know, calculus is wonderful. When I was a kid, I was a calculus whiz. I don't understand a thing about it now, but I could do it as a kid. Geometry, fantastic. You know, quantum mechanics \u2014 these are cool things. But they don't save marriages and they don't raise children.And my look to the future is, and what I want to do with this doggy stuff, is to teach people that you know, your husband's just as easy to train. Probably easier \u2014 if you got a Rottie \u2014 much easier to train. Your kids are easy to train. All you've got to do is to watch them, to time-sample the behavior, and say, every five minutes, you ask the question, \"Is it good, or is it bad?\" If it's good, say, \"That was really neat, thank you.\" That is such a powerful training technique. This should be taught in schools. Relationships \u2014 how do you negotiate? How you do negotiate with your friend who wants your toy? You know, how to prepare you for your first relationship? How on earth about raising children? We think how we do it \u2014 one night in bed, we're pregnant, and then we're raising the most important thing in life, a child. No, this is what should be taught \u2014 the good living, the good habits, which are just as hard to break as bad habits. So, that would be my wish to the future. Ah, damn, I wanted to end exactly on time, but I got eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two \u2014 so thank you very much. That's my talk, thank you.

Rear end wins.\n\n00:00:47.958 --> 00:00:49.958\nI mean, you lose.\n\n00:00:49.958 --> 00:00:52.958\nYou cannot compete with the environment,\n\n00:00:52.958 --> 00:00:54.958\nif you have an adolescent dog's brain.\n\n00:00:54.958 --> 00:00:58.958\nSo, when we train, we're always trying to take into account\n\n00:00:58.958 --> 00:01:00.958\nthe dog's point of view.\n\n00:01:00.958 --> 00:01:02.958\nNow, I'm here largely because\n\n00:01:02.958 --> 00:01:05.958\nthere's kind of a rift in dog training at the moment\n\n00:01:05.958 --> 00:01:09.958\nthat -- on one side, we have people who think that you train a dog,\n\n00:01:09.958 --> 00:01:13.958\nnumber one, by making up rules, human rules.\n\n00:01:13.958 --> 00:01:15.958\nWe don't take the dog's point of view into account.\n\n00:01:15.958 --> 00:01:18.958\nSo the human says, \"You're going to act this way, damn it.\n\n00:01:18.958 --> 00:01:22.958\nWe're going to force you to act against your will, to bend to our will.\"\n\n00:01:22.958 --> 00:01:25.958\nThen, number two, we keep these rules a secret from the dog.\n\n00:01:25.958 --> 00:01:28.958\nAnd then number three, now we can punish the dog\n\n00:01:28.958 --> 00:01:31.958\nfor breaking rules he didn't even know existed.\n\n00:01:31.958 --> 00:01:35.958\nSo you get a little puppy, he comes. His only crime is he grew.\n\n00:01:35.958 --> 00:01:38.958\nWhen he was a little puppy, he puts his paws on your leg --\n\n00:01:38.958 --> 00:01:40.958\nyou know, isn't that nice?\n\n00:01:40.958 --> 00:01:42.958\nAnd you go, \"Oh, there's a good boy.\"\n\n00:01:42.958 --> 00:01:46.958\nYou bend down, you pat him -- you reward him for jumping up.\n\n00:01:46.958 --> 00:01:50.958\nHis one mistake is he's a Tibetan mastiff, and a few months later,\n\n00:01:50.958 --> 00:01:53.958\nhe weighs, you know, 80 pounds.\n\n00:01:53.958 --> 00:01:56.958\nEvery time he jumps up, he gets all sorts of abuse.\n\n00:01:56.958 --> 00:02:01.958\nI mean, it is really very, very scary the abuse that dogs get.\n\n00:02:01.958 --> 00:02:05.958\nSo, this whole dominance issue -- number one,\n\n00:02:05.958 --> 00:02:08.958\nwhat we get in dog training is this Mickey-Mouse interpretation\n\n00:02:08.958 --> 00:02:11.958\nof a very complicated social system.\n\n00:02:11.958 --> 00:02:13.958\nAnd they take this stuff seriously.\n\n00:02:13.958 --> 00:02:15.958\nMale dogs are very serious about a hierarchy,\n\n00:02:15.958 --> 00:02:18.958\nbecause it prevents physical fights.\n\n00:02:18.958 --> 00:02:21.958\nOf course, female dogs, bitches, on the other hand,\n\n00:02:21.958 --> 00:02:24.958\nhave several bitch amendments to male hierarchical rule.\n\n00:02:24.958 --> 00:02:26.958\nThe number one is, \"I have it, you don't.\"\n\n00:02:26.958 --> 00:02:30.958\nAnd what you will find is a very, very low-ranking bitch\n\n00:02:30.958 --> 00:02:34.958\nwill quite easily keep a bone away from a high-ranking male.\n\n00:02:34.958 --> 00:02:37.958\nSo, we get in dog training this notion of dominances,\n\n00:02:37.958 --> 00:02:40.958\nor of the alpha dog. I'm sure that you've heard this.\n\n00:02:40.958 --> 00:02:42.958\nDogs get so abused.\n\n00:02:42.958 --> 00:02:44.958\nDogs, horses and humans --\n\n00:02:44.958 --> 00:02:47.958\nthese are the three species which are so abused in life.\n\n00:02:47.958 --> 00:02:49.958\nAnd the reason is built into their behavior --\n\n00:02:49.958 --> 00:02:52.958\nis to always come back and apologize.\n\n00:02:52.958 --> 00:02:55.958\nLike, \"Oh, I'm sorry you had to beat me. I'm really sorry, yes, it's my fault.\"\n\n00:02:55.958 --> 00:02:57.958\nThey are just so beatable,\n\n00:02:57.958 --> 00:02:59.958\nand that's why they get beaten.\n\n00:02:59.958 --> 00:03:04.958\nThe poor puppy jumps up, you open the dog book, what does it say?\n\n00:03:04.958 --> 00:03:06.958\n\"Hold his front paws, squeeze his front paws,\n\n00:03:06.958 --> 00:03:10.958\nstamp on his hind feet, squirt him in the face with lemon juice,\n\n00:03:10.958 --> 00:03:12.958\nhit him on the head with a rolled-up newspaper,\n\n00:03:12.958 --> 00:03:14.958\nknee him in the chest, flip him over backwards.\"\n\n00:03:14.958 --> 00:03:16.958\nBecause he grew?\n\n00:03:16.958 --> 00:03:19.958\nAnd because he's performing a behavior you've trained him to do?\n\n00:03:19.958 --> 00:03:22.958\nThis is insanity.\n\n00:03:22.958 --> 00:03:25.958\nI ask owners, \"Well, how would you like the dog to greet you?\"\n\n00:03:25.958 --> 00:03:28.958\nAnd people say, \"Well, I don't know, to sit, I guess.\"\n\n00:03:28.958 --> 00:03:30.958\nI said, \"Let's teach him to sit.\"\n\n00:03:30.958 --> 00:03:33.958\nAnd then we give him a reason for sitting.\n\n00:03:34.958 --> 00:03:37.958\nBecause the first stage\n\n00:03:37.958 --> 00:03:40.958\nis basically teaching a dog ESL.\n\n00:03:40.958 --> 00:03:44.958\nI could speak to you and say, \"Laytay-chai, paisey, paisey.\"\n\n00:03:45.958 --> 00:03:47.958\nGo on, something should happen now.\n\n00:03:47.958 --> 00:03:50.958\nWhy aren't you responding? Oh, you don't speak Swahili.\n\n00:03:50.958 --> 00:03:52.958\nWell, I've got news for you.\n\n00:03:52.958 --> 00:03:57.958\nThe dog doesn't speak English, or American, or Spanish, or French.\n\n00:03:57.958 --> 00:04:00.958\nSo the first stage in training is to teach the dog ESL,\n\n00:04:00.958 --> 00:04:02.958\nEnglish as a second language.\n\n00:04:02.958 --> 00:04:04.958\nAnd that's how we use the food lure in the hand,\n\n00:04:04.958 --> 00:04:07.958\nand we use food because we're dealing with owners.\n\n00:04:07.958 --> 00:04:09.958\nMy wife doesn't need food -- she's a great trainer,\n\n00:04:09.958 --> 00:04:10.958\nmuch better than I am.\n\n00:04:10.958 --> 00:04:13.958\nI don't need food, but the average owner says,\n\n00:04:13.958 --> 00:04:15.958\n\"Puppy, sit.\"\n\n00:04:15.958 --> 00:04:17.958\nOr they go, \"Sit, sit, sit.\"\n\n00:04:17.958 --> 00:04:20.958\nThey're making a hand signal in front of the dog's rectum for some reason,\n\n00:04:20.958 --> 00:04:23.958\nlike the dog has a third eye there -- it's insane.\n\n00:04:23.958 --> 00:04:25.958\nYou know, \"Sit, sit.\"\n\n00:04:25.958 --> 00:04:29.958\nNo, we go, \"Puppy, sit\" -- boom, it's got it in six to 10 trials.\n\n00:04:29.958 --> 00:04:31.958\nThen we phase out the food as a lure,\n\n00:04:31.958 --> 00:04:33.958\nand now the dog knows that \"sit\" means sit,\n\n00:04:33.958 --> 00:04:35.958\nand you can actually communicate to a dog\n\n00:04:35.958 --> 00:04:37.958\nin a perfectly constructed English sentence.\n\n00:04:37.958 --> 00:04:41.958\n\"Phoenix, come here, take this, and go to Jamie, please.\"\n\n00:04:41.958 --> 00:04:44.958\nAnd I've taught her \"Phoenix,\" \"come here,\" \"take this,\" \"go to\"\n\n00:04:44.958 --> 00:04:46.958\nand the name of my son, \"Jamie.\"\n\n00:04:46.958 --> 00:04:48.958\nAnd the dog can take a note,\n\n00:04:48.958 --> 00:04:50.958\nand I've got my own little search-and-rescue dog.\n\n00:04:50.958 --> 00:04:52.958\nHe'll find Jamie wherever he is, you know,\n\n00:04:52.958 --> 00:04:54.958\nwherever kids are, crushing rocks by a stream or something,\n\n00:04:54.958 --> 00:04:56.958\nand take him a little message that says,\n\n00:04:56.958 --> 00:04:59.958\n\"Hey, dinner's ready. Come in for dinner.\"\n\n00:04:59.958 --> 00:05:02.958\nSo, at this point, the dog knows what we want it to do.\n\n00:05:02.958 --> 00:05:04.958\nWill it do it?\n\n00:05:04.958 --> 00:05:06.958\nNot necessarily, no.\n\n00:05:06.958 --> 00:05:09.958\nAs I said, if he's in the park and there's a rear end to sniff,\n\n00:05:09.958 --> 00:05:11.958\nwhy come to the owner?\n\n00:05:11.958 --> 00:05:14.958\nThe dog lives with you, the dog can get you any time.\n\n00:05:14.958 --> 00:05:17.958\nThe dog can sniff your butt, if you like, when he wants to.\n\n00:05:17.958 --> 00:05:19.958\nAt the moment, he's in the park, and you are competing\n\n00:05:19.958 --> 00:05:22.958\nwith smells, and other dogs, and squirrels.\n\n00:05:22.958 --> 00:05:26.958\nSo the second stage in training is to teach the dog to want to do\n\n00:05:26.958 --> 00:05:29.958\nwhat we want him to do, and this is very easy.\n\n00:05:29.958 --> 00:05:31.958\nWe use the Premack principle.\n\n00:05:31.958 --> 00:05:33.958\nBasically, we follow a low-frequency behavior --\n\n00:05:33.958 --> 00:05:35.958\none the dog doesn't want to do --\n\n00:05:35.958 --> 00:05:39.958\nby a high-frequency behavior, commonly known as a behavior problem,\n\n00:05:39.958 --> 00:05:43.958\nor a dog hobby -- something the dog does like to do.\n\n00:05:43.958 --> 00:05:46.958\nThat will then become a reward for the lower-frequency behavior.\n\n00:05:46.958 --> 00:05:50.958\nSo we go, \"sit,\" on the couch; \"sit,\" tummy-rub; \"sit,\"\n\n00:05:50.958 --> 00:05:54.958\nlook, I throw a tennis ball; \"sit,\" say hello to that other dog.\n\n00:05:54.958 --> 00:05:56.958\nYes, we put \"sniff butt\" on queue.\n\n00:05:56.958 --> 00:05:58.958\n\"Sit,\" sniff butt.\n\n00:05:58.958 --> 00:06:02.958\nSo now all of these distractions that worked against training\n\n00:06:02.958 --> 00:06:05.958\nnow become rewards that work for training.\n\n00:06:05.958 --> 00:06:10.958\nAnd what we're doing, in essence, is we're teaching the dog, kind of like --\n\n00:06:10.958 --> 00:06:13.958\nwe're letting the dog think that the dog is training us.\n\n00:06:13.958 --> 00:06:15.958\nAnd I can imagine this dog, you know,\n\n00:06:15.958 --> 00:06:17.958\nspeaking through the fence to, say, an Akita,\n\n00:06:17.958 --> 00:06:21.958\nsaying, \"Wow, my owners, they are so incredibly easy to train.\n\n00:06:21.958 --> 00:06:23.958\nThey're like Golden Retrievers.\n\n00:06:23.958 --> 00:06:25.958\nAll I have to do is sit, and they do everything.\n\n00:06:25.958 --> 00:06:29.958\nThey open doors, they drive my car, they massage me,\n\n00:06:29.958 --> 00:06:31.958\nthey will throw tennis balls,\n\n00:06:31.958 --> 00:06:33.958\nthey will cook for me and serve the food.\n\n00:06:33.958 --> 00:06:36.958\nIt's like, if I just sit, that's my command.\n\n00:06:36.958 --> 00:06:38.958\nThen I have my own personal doorman,\n\n00:06:38.958 --> 00:06:42.958\nchauffeur, masseuse, chef and waiter.\"\n\n00:06:42.958 --> 00:06:44.958\nAnd now the dog's really happy.\n\n00:06:44.958 --> 00:06:46.958\nAnd this, to me, is always what training is.\n\n00:06:46.958 --> 00:06:49.958\nSo we really motivate the dog to want to do it,\n\n00:06:49.958 --> 00:06:54.958\nsuch that the need for punishment seldom comes up.\n\n00:06:54.958 --> 00:06:57.958\nNow we move to phase three, when now --\n\n00:06:57.958 --> 00:06:59.958\nthere's times, you know, when daddy knows best.\n\n00:06:59.958 --> 00:07:02.958\nAnd I have a little sign on my fridge, and it says,\n\n00:07:02.958 --> 00:07:04.958\n\"Because I'm the daddy, that's why.\"\n\n00:07:04.958 --> 00:07:08.958\nSorry, no more explanation. \"I'm the daddy, you're not. Sit.\"\n\n00:07:08.958 --> 00:07:10.958\nAnd there's times, for example,\n\n00:07:10.958 --> 00:07:13.958\nif my son's friends leave the door open,\n\n00:07:13.958 --> 00:07:17.958\nthe dogs have to know you don't step across this line.\n\n00:07:17.958 --> 00:07:19.958\nThis is a life-or-death thing.\n\n00:07:19.958 --> 00:07:22.958\nYou leave this, the sanctity of your house,\n\n00:07:22.958 --> 00:07:24.958\nand you could be hit on the street.\n\n00:07:24.958 --> 00:07:26.958\nSo some things we have to let the dog know,\n\n00:07:26.958 --> 00:07:28.958\n\"You mustn't do this.\"\n\n00:07:28.958 --> 00:07:33.958\nAnd so we have to enforce, but without force.\n\n00:07:33.958 --> 00:07:37.958\nPeople here get very confused about what a punishment is.\n\n00:07:37.958 --> 00:07:39.958\nThey think a punishment is something nasty.\n\n00:07:39.958 --> 00:07:41.958\nI bet a lot of you do, right?\n\n00:07:41.958 --> 00:07:44.958\nYou think it's something painful, or scary, or nasty.\n\n00:07:44.958 --> 00:07:46.958\nIt doesn't have to be.\n\n00:07:46.958 --> 00:07:49.958\nThere's several definitions of what a punishment is,\n\n00:07:49.958 --> 00:07:51.958\nbut one definition, the most popular, is:\n\n00:07:51.958 --> 00:07:56.958\na punishment is a stimulus that reduces the immediately preceding behavior,\n\n00:07:56.958 --> 00:08:00.958\nsuch that it's less likely to occur in the future.\n\n00:08:00.958 --> 00:08:05.958\nIt does not have to be nasty, scary or painful.\n\n00:08:05.958 --> 00:08:10.958\nAnd I would say, if it doesn't have to be, then maybe it shouldn't be.\n\n00:08:10.958 --> 00:08:13.958\nI was working with a very dangerous dog about a year ago.\n\n00:08:13.958 --> 00:08:16.958\nAnd this was a dog that put both his owners in hospital,\n\n00:08:16.958 --> 00:08:18.958\nplus the brother-in-law, plus the child.\n\n00:08:18.958 --> 00:08:21.958\nAnd I only agreed to work with it if they promised it would stay in their house,\n\n00:08:21.958 --> 00:08:23.958\nand they never took it outside.\n\n00:08:23.958 --> 00:08:25.958\nThe dog is actually euthanized now,\n\n00:08:25.958 --> 00:08:27.958\nbut this was a dog I worked with for a while.\n\n00:08:27.958 --> 00:08:30.958\nA lot of the aggression happened around the kitchen,\n\n00:08:30.958 --> 00:08:33.958\nso while I was there -- this was on the fourth visit --\n\n00:08:33.958 --> 00:08:36.958\nwe did a four and a half hour down-stay, with the dog on his mat.\n\n00:08:36.958 --> 00:08:41.958\nAnd he was kept there by the owner's calm insistence.\n\n00:08:41.958 --> 00:08:43.958\nWhen the dog would try to leave the mat,\n\n00:08:43.958 --> 00:08:47.958\nshe would say, \"Rover, on the mat, on the mat, on the mat.\"\n\n00:08:47.958 --> 00:08:52.958\nThe dog broke his down-stay 22 times in four and a half hours, while she cooked dinner,\n\n00:08:52.958 --> 00:08:56.958\nbecause we had a lot of aggression related towards food.\n\n00:08:56.958 --> 00:08:58.958\nThe breaks got fewer and fewer.\n\n00:08:58.958 --> 00:09:01.958\nYou see, the punishment was working.\n\n00:09:01.958 --> 00:09:03.958\nThe behavior problem was going away.\n\n00:09:03.958 --> 00:09:05.958\nShe never raised her voice.\n\n00:09:05.958 --> 00:09:08.958\nIf she did, she would have got bitten.\n\n00:09:08.958 --> 00:09:10.958\nIt's not a good dog you shout at.\n\n00:09:10.958 --> 00:09:13.958\nAnd a lot of my friends train really neat animals,\n\n00:09:13.958 --> 00:09:15.958\ngrizzly bears -- if you've ever seen a grizzly bear\n\n00:09:15.958 --> 00:09:18.958\non the telly or in film, then it's a friend of mine who's trained it --\n\n00:09:18.958 --> 00:09:21.958\nkiller whales. I love it because it wires you up.\n\n00:09:21.958 --> 00:09:23.958\nHow are you going to reprimand a grizzly bear?\n\n00:09:23.958 --> 00:09:25.958\n\"Bad bear, bad bear!\" Voom!\n\n00:09:25.958 --> 00:09:30.958\nYour head now is 100 yards away, sailing through the air, OK?\n\n00:09:30.958 --> 00:09:32.958\nThis is crazy.\n\n00:09:32.958 --> 00:09:34.958\nSo, where do we go from here?\n\n00:09:34.958 --> 00:09:36.958\nWe want a better way.\n\n00:09:36.958 --> 00:09:38.958\nDogs deserve better.\n\n00:09:38.958 --> 00:09:42.958\nBut for me, the reason for this actually has to do with dogs.\n\n00:09:42.958 --> 00:09:45.958\nIt has to do with watching people train puppies,\n\n00:09:45.958 --> 00:09:50.958\nand realizing they have horrendous interaction skills,\n\n00:09:50.958 --> 00:09:52.958\nhorrendous relationship skills.\n\n00:09:52.958 --> 00:09:56.958\nNot just with their puppy, but with the rest of the family at class.\n\n00:09:56.958 --> 00:09:59.958\nI mean, my all-time classic is another \"come here\" one.\n\n00:09:59.958 --> 00:10:02.958\nYou see someone in the park -- and I'll cover my mic when I say this,\n\n00:10:02.958 --> 00:10:05.958\nbecause I don't want to wake you up -- and there's the owner in the park,\n\n00:10:05.958 --> 00:10:07.958\nand their dog's over here, and they say, \"Rover, come here.\n\n00:10:07.958 --> 00:10:10.958\nRover, come here.

Not being the musicians \u2014 the listeners, right? And we crave one thing, even though we kind of don't know it all the time. We crave to be in the room with the musician the day it was recorded, the day it was played. And we go to live concerts, and we get that as much as we can. But then we listen to the other 99 percent of our stuff recorded. And it turns out the further back you go in history, the little rougher it sounds. And so we said, there's a solution to this. Let's separate the performance, as a thing, out from the recording, which was how it was made. You know, the thing with microphones in the room and all that day. But the performance itself was how the musicians worked their fingers, and what instruments they were using. And it's the data hidden inside the recording. In order to do this, it's a lot of hardware and software that runs in a very high resolution. And Yamaha makes an incredible thing called the Disklavier Pro that looks like a nice grand piano there. And you probably didn't realize it's going to do all these things \u2014 but full of solenoids, and fiber optics, and computers and all this kind of stuff. The highest resolution out of Japan. And this just didn't work until we could cross this line that says high-definition. And we were able to cross this line, called the uncanny valley, in terms of \u2014 artificial intelligence terms. We have a process where we, you know, kind of put it into the computer and digitize it, and then a whole lot of analysis. And we look at every single note, and all the attributes of those notes: how hard they were struck, and how they were held down, and how you move the fingers. So we had to develop a whole new science of how you move your fingers. And, you know, it's a thing your piano teacher teaches you, but we never had a science behind these kinds of things.I'm going to start with Glenn Gould. He died 25 years ago this year, and was born 75 years ago this year. Was a beloved pianist, maybe the great cult pianist of the twentieth century. He just got tired of being in front of an audience, and felt like \u2014 a performing monkey was, in fact, his term. So he stepped back, and did nothing but the crafting of his work. And Gould's specialty was playing Bach. His maybe most famous recording was something called \"The Goldberg Variations.\" Bach only wrote themes and variations one time. He wrote some early pieces, but late in his life, in his mature period, he said, \"Here's a theme \u2014 30 variations.\" In fact, the theme isn't even the melody, it's the bass line. And Gould recorded it in two major recordings that you may know about, one in mono, and one in stereo. And the one in mono, by the way, he used the pedal, and as he got older, he said, \"No, no, wait a minute. I'm going to get very scientific about this, and not use the pedal.\" What I'd like you to hear live is the 1955 version, and we'll play the first couple pieces of it. Glenn Gould, 1955. (Music) How about that? (Applause)So let me tell you a little bit how this was done. First of all, let me get you to the end step. This is \u2014 we have a fairly complex process that, you know, software and musicians and so on, but when we're all done, we know that the ear is the final arbiter. We can play the original in one ear, and a new recording in the other. So I'm going to do this for you right now, what you just heard. And in the right speaker is going to be the original recording, and the left speaker is going to be the new recording, actually of an instrument just like that one, and I'm going to play them together at the same time. (Music) That's the original. [Unclear] That's the two together. (Music)Before \"Jurassic Park,\" there was no science for how skin hung off of muscle, right? So, in the video world, we've been able to invent, in our lifetimes, natural behavior. And this is kind of another example of putting a science behind natural behavior. And then you heard the original. Ultimately, I started with the experience. And the experience is: I want to be in the room and hear the musicians. Lots of you can afford to buy one of these. But, if not, there is now high-definition surround sound. And I got to tell you, if you haven't heard high-definition surround, go down to your audio dealer, your audiophile dealer. It's so involving compared to regular stereo. But if you don't have that, maybe you can listen on your headphones. And so on the same disk we have five recordings \u2014 Sony has five recordings. And you could listen in headphones with this thing called binaural recording. And it's a dummy head that sits in front of the instrument, and it's got microphones where the ears are. And when you put on headphones, and you listen to this, you're inside of Glenn Gould's body. And it is a chuckle until, you know, the musicians, who are musicians who play the piano, listen to this, say, \"I can't believe it! It's just what it's like to play the piano.\" Except now you're inside Glenn Gould's body playing the piano, and it feels like your fingers are making the decisions and moving through the whole process. It's a game changer.Here's now something we know in spectacular quality. The whole process is very sensitive to temperature and humidity. What you heard today was not perfect. It's an amalgam of wood, and cast iron, and felt, and steel strings, and all these, and they're all amazingly sensitive to temperature and humidity. So when you go into the recording session, you get to stop after every piece and rebuild the piano if you need to. There's the whole action there, sitting, kind of, on the side, and the dummy head and our recording engineers standing around while we rebuild the piano. Without putting dates next to these things, step-by-step music will be turned into data, like every field that's occurred in the past 35 or 40 years. Audio has come very late to this game \u2014 I'm not talking about digitizing, and bits, and re-mastering. I'm talking about turn it into the data that it was made from, which is how it was performed. And audio came very late because our ears are so hard to fool \u2014 they're high-resolution, and they're wired straight to our emotions, and you can't trick them very easily. Your eyes are pretty happy with some color and movement, you know.All right, there's this episode of \"Star Trek.\" (Laughter) I get it \u2014 it was all just laid in for me yesterday there. The episode of \"Star Trek\" for me was James Daly played Methuselah \u2014 remember this one? And at some point he's dancing with his \u2014 and I won't ruin the episode for you, from 1967. Right, do you know where I'm going? And Nimoy, I'm sorry, Spock sits down at the piano, and he starts playing this Brahms waltz, and they all dance to it. And then Spock turns round, he goes, \"James, I know all of the Brahms waltzes, and I don't believe this is one of them in the category.\" That's where I'm at. I want to hear the waltzes Brahms didn't write. I want to hear the pieces that Horowitz didn't play. But I believe we're on a path now, when we get to data, that we can distill styles, and templates, and formulas, and all these kinds of things, again, that you've seen happen in the computer graphics world. It's now coming in this world. The transition will be this one. It says right now, we think music is notes and how they're played. And I believe this is coming. Because what you've just heard was a computer playing data \u2014 no Glenn Gould in the room. But yet, it was human. And I believe you'll get to the next step, the real dream of listeners. Every time you listen to a recording today, every time you take out your iPod and whatever, every time you listen to it, it's the same thing \u2014 it's frozen. Wouldn't it be cool if every time you listened, it could be different? This morning, you're sadder, you want to hear your song, the same song, played sadder than you did yesterday. You want to hear it played by different musicians. You want to hear it in different rooms and whatever.We've seen all these \"Star Treks,\" and they're all holodeck episodes as well. Every time I listen to that, I get goose bumps. It's so amazing, it's so exciting. Every time I listen to that recording it's like, \"Oh my God, I can't believe I'm in the same room. I can't believe this is happening.\" It's a way better experience than whatever you're used to listening to, in whatever form. And lastly, I will wrap up with one minute of Art Tatum. So I've really overshot my budget here. We made a new recording of him playing in the Shrine Auditorium in September. It was a concert he recorded in the Shrine Auditorium in 1949. And I've got to tell you, we have this lab where we build and measure everything, back in Raleigh, North Carolina, and we flew out to Los Angeles. And as the president of the company, I didn't feel real comfortable about where we were. That's a real uncomfortable feeling, when all the equipment's come out and a whole Sony team, and people are going to be sitting there in the audience. And we put the piano on the sweet spot of the stage in the Shrine, which has not changed since 1949, still seats 6,000 people. And on the sweet spot on the stage, Tatum starts playing ... and every note, every beat, every slur, every accent, every pedal was perfect, because he played it for that room on that day. And we captured all that data all over again. And I want you to hear that right now. And fortunately, it's right in here. This is an encore he used to do. It's one minute long. It's an Irish jig, and I want you to hear his humor. (Music) (Applause) And that's just what the live audience did. (Applause) So thank you very much, Michael, thank you for the opportunity.", "id": 329, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:11.958 --> 00:00:15.958\nNinety-nine percent of us have the dream of listeners.\n\n00:00:15.958 --> 00:00:17.958\nNot being the musicians -- the listeners, right?\n\n00:00:17.958 --> 00:00:19.958\nAnd we crave one thing,\n\n00:00:19.958 --> 00:00:21.958\neven though we kind of don't know it all the time.\n\n00:00:21.958 --> 00:00:26.958\nWe crave to be in the room with the musician\n\n00:00:26.958 --> 00:00:28.958\nthe day it was recorded, the day it was played.\n\n00:00:28.958 --> 00:00:31.958\nAnd we go to live concerts, and we get that as much as we can.\n\n00:00:31.958 --> 00:00:34.958\nBut then we listen to the other 99 percent of our stuff recorded.\n\n00:00:34.958 --> 00:00:37.958\nAnd it turns out the further back you go in history,\n\n00:00:37.958 --> 00:00:39.958\nthe little rougher it sounds.\n\n00:00:39.958 --> 00:00:43.958\nAnd so we said, there's a solution to this.\n\n00:00:43.958 --> 00:00:47.958\nLet's separate the performance, as a thing,\n\n00:00:47.958 --> 00:00:50.958\nout from the recording, which was how it was made.\n\n00:00:50.958 --> 00:00:53.958\nYou know, the thing with microphones in the room and all that day.\n\n00:00:53.958 --> 00:00:56.958\nBut the performance itself was how the musicians worked their fingers,\n\n00:00:56.958 --> 00:00:58.958\nand what instruments they were using.\n\n00:00:58.958 --> 00:01:03.958\nAnd it's the data hidden inside the recording.\n\n00:01:03.958 --> 00:01:06.958\nIn order to do this, it's a lot of hardware and software\n\n00:01:06.958 --> 00:01:08.958\nthat runs in a very high resolution.\n\n00:01:08.958 --> 00:01:10.958\nAnd Yamaha makes an incredible thing called the Disklavier Pro\n\n00:01:12.958 --> 00:01:14.958\nthat looks like a nice grand piano there.\n\n00:01:14.958 --> 00:01:16.958\nAnd you probably didn't realize it's going to do all these things --\n\n00:01:16.958 --> 00:01:19.958\nbut full of solenoids, and fiber optics, and computers\n\n00:01:19.958 --> 00:01:22.958\nand all this kind of stuff.

[Unclear] That's the two together.\n\n00:06:14.958 --> 00:06:50.958\n(Music)\n\n00:06:50.958 --> 00:06:52.958\nBefore \"Jurassic Park,\"\n\n00:06:52.958 --> 00:06:58.958\nthere was no science for how skin hung off of muscle, right?\n\n00:06:58.958 --> 00:06:59.958\nSo, in the video world,\n\n00:06:59.958 --> 00:07:02.958\nwe've been able to invent, in our lifetimes, natural behavior.\n\n00:07:02.958 --> 00:07:04.958\nAnd this is kind of another example\n\n00:07:04.958 --> 00:07:07.958\nof putting a science behind natural behavior.\n\n00:07:07.958 --> 00:07:09.958\nAnd then you heard the original.\n\n00:07:09.958 --> 00:07:11.958\nUltimately, I started with the experience.\n\n00:07:11.958 --> 00:07:15.958\nAnd the experience is: I want to be in the room and hear the musicians.\n\n00:07:15.958 --> 00:07:17.958\nLots of you can afford to buy one of these.\n\n00:07:17.958 --> 00:07:23.958\nBut, if not, there is now high-definition surround sound.\n\n00:07:23.958 --> 00:07:26.958\nAnd I got to tell you, if you haven't heard high-definition surround,\n\n00:07:26.958 --> 00:07:28.958\ngo down to your audio dealer, your audiophile dealer.\n\n00:07:28.958 --> 00:07:32.958\nIt's so involving compared to regular stereo.\n\n00:07:32.958 --> 00:07:34.958\nBut if you don't have that, maybe you can listen on your headphones.\n\n00:07:34.958 --> 00:07:36.958\nAnd so on the same disk we have five recordings --\n\n00:07:36.958 --> 00:07:38.958\nSony has five recordings.\n\n00:07:38.958 --> 00:07:40.958\nAnd you could listen in headphones\n\n00:07:40.958 --> 00:07:43.958\nwith this thing called binaural recording.\n\n00:07:43.958 --> 00:07:47.958\nAnd it's a dummy head that sits in front of the instrument,\n\n00:07:47.958 --> 00:07:51.958\nand it's got microphones where the ears are.\n\n00:07:51.958 --> 00:07:53.958\nAnd when you put on headphones, and you listen to this,\n\n00:07:53.958 --> 00:07:55.958\nyou're inside of Glenn Gould's body.\n\n00:07:55.958 --> 00:07:58.958\nAnd it is a chuckle until, you know, the musicians,\n\n00:07:58.958 --> 00:08:00.958\nwho are musicians who play the piano, listen to this, say,\n\n00:08:00.958 --> 00:08:02.958\n\"I can't believe it!

easily.\n\n00:09:08.958 --> 00:09:11.958\nYour eyes are pretty happy with some color and movement, you know.\n\n00:09:11.958 --> 00:09:14.958\nAll right, there's this episode of \"Star Trek.\"\n\n00:09:14.958 --> 00:09:17.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:09:17.958 --> 00:09:19.958\nI get it -- it was all just laid in for me yesterday there.\n\n00:09:19.958 --> 00:09:23.958\nThe episode of \"Star Trek\" for me was James Daly played Methuselah --\n\n00:09:23.958 --> 00:09:25.958\nremember this one?\n\n00:09:25.958 --> 00:09:28.958\nAnd at some point he's dancing with his --\n\n00:09:28.958 --> 00:09:30.958\nand I won't ruin the episode for you, from 1967.\n\n00:09:30.958 --> 00:09:32.958\nRight, do you know where I'm going?\n\n00:09:32.958 --> 00:09:34.958\nAnd Nimoy, I'm sorry, Spock sits down at the piano,\n\n00:09:34.958 --> 00:09:38.958\nand he starts playing this Brahms waltz, and they all dance to it.\n\n00:09:38.958 --> 00:09:40.958\nAnd then Spock turns round, he goes,\n\n00:09:40.958 --> 00:09:45.958\n\"James, I know all of the Brahms waltzes,\n\n00:09:45.958 --> 00:09:47.958\nand I don't believe this is one of them in the category.\"\n\n00:09:49.958 --> 00:09:51.958\nThat's where I'm at.\n\n00:09:51.958 --> 00:09:55.958\nI want to hear the waltzes Brahms didn't write.\n\n00:09:55.958 --> 00:09:59.958\nI want to hear the pieces that Horowitz didn't play.\n\n00:09:59.958 --> 00:10:04.958\nBut I believe we're on a path now, when we get to data,\n\n00:10:04.958 --> 00:10:08.958\nthat we can distill styles, and templates, and formulas, and all these kinds of things,\n\n00:10:08.958 --> 00:10:11.958\nagain, that you've seen happen in the computer graphics world.\n\n00:10:11.958 --> 00:10:13.958\nIt's now coming in this world.\n\n00:10:13.958 --> 00:10:15.958\nThe transition will be this one.\n\n00:10:15.958 --> 00:10:18.958\nIt says right now, we think music is notes and how they're played.\n\n00:10:18.958 --> 00:10:20.958\nAnd I believe this is coming.\n\n00:10:20.958 --> 00:10:25.958\nBecause what you've just heard was a computer playing data --\n\n00:10:25.958 --> 00:10:27.958\nno Glenn Gould in the room.\n\n00:10:27.958 --> 00:10:29.958\nBut yet, it was human.\n\n00:10:29.958 --> 00:10:32.958\nAnd I believe you'll get to the next step, the real dream of listeners.\n\n00:10:32.958 --> 00:10:35.958\nEvery time you listen to a recording today,\n\n00:10:35.958 --> 00:10:37.958\nevery time you take out your iPod and whatever,\n\n00:10:37.958 --> 00:10:42.958\nevery time you listen to it, it's the same thing -- it's frozen.\n\n00:10:42.958 --> 00:10:46.958\nWouldn't it be cool if every time you listened, it could be different?\n\n00:10:46.958 --> 00:10:49.958\nThis morning, you're sadder, you want to hear your song,\n\n00:10:49.958 --> 00:10:51.958\nthe same song, played sadder than you did yesterday.\n\n00:10:51.958 --> 00:10:53.958\nYou want to hear it played by different musicians.\n\n00:10:53.958 --> 00:10:55.958\nYou want to hear it in different rooms and whatever.\n\n00:10:56.958 --> 00:10:58.958\nWe've seen all these \"Star Treks,\" and they're all holodeck episodes as well.\n\n00:10:58.958 --> 00:11:01.958\nEvery time I listen to that, I get goose bumps.\n\n00:11:01.958 --> 00:11:04.958\nIt's so amazing, it's so exciting.\n\n00:11:04.958 --> 00:11:06.958\nEvery time I listen to that recording it's like, \"Oh my God,\n\n00:11:06.958 --> 00:11:08.958\nI can't believe I'm in the same room. I can't believe this is happening.\"\n\n00:11:08.958 --> 00:11:10.958\nIt's a way better experience\n\n00:11:10.958 --> 00:11:12.958\nthan whatever you're used to listening to, in whatever form.\n\n00:11:12.958 --> 00:11:17.958\nAnd lastly, I will wrap up with one minute of Art Tatum.\n\n00:11:17.958 --> 00:11:19.958\nSo I've really overshot my budget here.\n\n00:11:19.958 --> 00:11:22.958\nWe made a new recording of him\n\n00:11:22.958 --> 00:11:25.958\nplaying in the Shrine Auditorium in September.\n\n00:11:25.958 --> 00:11:29.958\nIt was a concert he recorded in the Shrine Auditorium in 1949.\n\n00:11:29.958 --> 00:11:31.958\nAnd I've got to tell you, we have this lab\n\n00:11:31.958 --> 00:11:34.958\nwhere we build and measure everything, back in Raleigh, North Carolina,\n\n00:11:34.958 --> 00:11:37.958\nand we flew out to Los Angeles.\n\n00:11:37.958 --> 00:11:39.958\nAnd as the president of the company,\n\n00:11:39.958 --> 00:11:42.958\nI didn't feel real comfortable about where we were.\n\n00:11:42.958 --> 00:11:44.958\nThat's a real uncomfortable feeling,\n\n00:11:44.958 --> 00:11:46.958\nwhen all the equipment's come out and a whole Sony team,\n\n00:11:46.958 --> 00:11:48.958\nand people are going to be sitting there in the audience.\n\n00:11:48.958 --> 00:11:52.958\nAnd we put the piano on the sweet spot of the stage in the Shrine,\n\n00:11:52.958 --> 00:11:56.958\nwhich has not changed since 1949, still seats 6,000 people.\n\n00:11:56.958 --> 00:11:59.958\nAnd on the sweet spot on the stage, Tatum starts playing ...\n\n00:11:59.958 --> 00:12:05.958\nand every note, every beat, every slur, every accent, every pedal\n\n00:12:05.958 --> 00:12:09.958\nwas perfect, because he played it for that room on that day.\n\n00:12:09.958 --> 00:12:11.958\nAnd we captured all that data all over again.\n\n00:12:11.958 --> 00:12:13.958\nAnd I want you to hear that right now.\n\n00:12:13.958 --> 00:12:15.958\nAnd fortunately, it's right in here.\n\n00:12:15.958 --> 00:12:18.958\nThis is an encore he used to do.\n\n00:12:18.958 --> 00:12:20.958\nIt's one minute long.\n\n00:12:20.958 --> 00:12:22.958\nIt's an Irish jig, and I want you to hear his humor.\n\n00:12:22.958 --> 00:13:18.958\n(Music)\n\n00:13:18.958 --> 00:13:19.958\n(Applause)\n\n00:13:19.958 --> 00:13:22.958\nAnd that's just what the live audience did.\n\n00:13:22.958 --> 00:13:24.958\n(Applause)\n\n00:13:24.958 --> 00:13:27.958\nSo thank you very much, Michael, thank you for the opportunity."}, {"title": "Kids can teach themselves", "duration": "1259", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/sugata_mitra_shows_how_kids_teach_themselves", "transcript": "I have a tough job to do. You know, when I looked at the profile of the audience here, with their connotations and design, in all its forms, and with so much and so many people working on collaborative and networks, and so on, that I wanted to tell you, I wanted to build an argument for primary education in a very specific context. In order to do that in 20 minutes, I have to bring out four ideas \u2014 it's like four pieces of a puzzle. And if I succeed in doing that, maybe you would go back with the thought that you could build on, and perhaps help me do my work.The first piece of the puzzle is remoteness and the quality of education. Now, by remoteness, I mean two or three different kinds of things. Of course, remoteness in its normal sense, which means that as you go further and further away from an urban center, you get to remoter areas. What happens to education? The second, or a different kind of remoteness is that within the large metropolitan areas all over the world, you have pockets, like slums, or shantytowns, or poorer areas, which are socially and economically remote from the rest of the city, so it's us and them. What happens to education in that context? So keep both of those ideas of remoteness.We made a guess. The guess was that schools in remote areas do not have good enough teachers. If they do have, they cannot retain those teachers. They do not have good enough infrastructure. And if they had some infrastructure, they have difficulty maintaining it. But I wanted to check if this is true. So what I did last year was we hired a car, looked up on Google, found a route into northern India from New Delhi which, you know, which did not cross any big cities or any big metropolitan centers. Drove out about 300 kilometers, and wherever we found a school, administered a set of standard tests, and then took those test results and plotted them on a graph. The graph was interesting, although you need to consider it carefully. I mean, this is a very small sample; you should not generalize from it. But it was quite obvious, quite clear, that for this particular route that I had taken, the remoter the school was, the worse its results seemed to be. That seemed a little damning, and I tried to correlate it with things like infrastructure, or with the availability of electricity, and things like that.To my surprise, it did not correlate. It did not correlate with the size of classrooms. It did not correlate with the quality of the infrastructure. It did not correlate with the poverty levels. It did not correlate. But what happened was that when I administered a questionnaire to each of these schools, with one single question for the teachers \u2014 which was, \"Would you like to move to an urban, metropolitan area?\" \u2014 69 percent of them said yes. And as you can see from that, they say yes just a little bit out of Delhi, and they say no when you hit the rich suburbs of Delhi \u2014 because, you know, those are relatively better off areas \u2014 and then from 200 kilometers out of Delhi, the answer is consistently yes. I would imagine that a teacher who comes or walks into class every day thinking that, I wish I was in some other school, probably has a deep impact on what happens to the results. So it looked as though teacher motivation and teacher migration was a powerfully correlated thing with what was happening in primary schools, as opposed to whether the children have enough to eat, and whether they are packed tightly into classrooms and that sort of thing. It appears that way.When you take education and technology, then I find in the literature that, you know, things like websites, collaborative environments \u2014 you've been listening to all that in the morning \u2014 it's always piloted first in the best schools, the best urban schools, and, according to me, biases the result. The literature \u2014 one part of it, the scientific literature \u2014 consistently blames ET as being over-hyped and under-performing. The teachers always say, well, it's fine, but it's too expensive for what it does. Because it's being piloted in a school where the students are already getting, let's say, 80 percent of whatever they could do. You put in this new super-duper technology, and now they get 83 percent. So the principal looks at it and says, 3 percent for 300,000 dollars? Forget it. If you took the same technology and piloted it into one of those remote schools, where the score was 30 percent, and, let's say, took that up to 40 percent \u2014 that will be a completely different thing. So the relative change that ET, Educational Technology, would make, would be far greater at the bottom of the pyramid than at the top, but we seem to be doing it the other way about.So I came to this conclusion that ET should reach the underprivileged first, not the other way about. And finally came the question of, how do you tackle teacher perception? Whenever you go to a teacher and show them some technology, the teacher's first reaction is, you cannot replace a teacher with a machine \u2014 it's impossible. I don't know why it's impossible, but, even for a moment, if you did assume that it's impossible \u2014 I have a quotation from Sir Arthur C. Clarke, the science fiction writer whom I met in Colombo, and he said something which completely solves this problem. He said a teacher than can be replaced by a machine, should be. So, you know, it puts the teacher into a tough bind, you have to think. Anyway, so I'm proposing that an alternative primary education, whatever alternative you want, is required where schools don't exist, where schools are not good enough, where teachers are not available or where teachers are not good enough, for whatever reason. If you happen to live in a part of the world where none of this applies, then you don't need an alternative education. So far I haven't come across such an area, except for one case. I won't name the area, but somewhere in the world people said, we don't have this problem, because we have perfect teachers and perfect schools. There are such areas, but \u2014 anyway, I'd never heard that anywhere else.I'm going to talk about children and self-organization, and a set of experiments which sort of led to this idea of what might an alternative education be like. They're called the hole-in-the-wall experiments. I'll have to really rush through this. They're a set of experiments. The first one was done in New Delhi in 1999. And what we did over there was pretty much simple. I had an office in those days which bordered a slum, an urban slum, so there was a dividing wall between our office and the urban slum. They cut a hole inside that wall \u2014 which is how it has got the name hole-in-the-wall \u2014 and put a pretty powerful PC into that hole, sort of embedded into the wall so that its monitor was sticking out at the other end, a touchpad similarly embedded into the wall, put it on high-speed Internet, put the Internet Explorer there, put it on Altavista.com \u2014 in those days \u2014 and just left it there.And this is what we saw. So that was my office in IIT. Here's the hole-in-the-wall. About eight hours later, we found this kid. To the right is this eight-year-old child who \u2014 and to his left is a six-year-old girl, who is not very tall. And what he was doing was, he was teaching her to browse. So it sort of raised more questions than it answered. Is this real? Does the language matter, because he's not supposed to know English? Will the computer last, or will they break it and steal it \u2014 and did anyone teach them? The last question is what everybody said, but you know, I mean, they must have poked their head over the wall and asked the people in your office, can you show me how to do it, and then somebody taught him.So I took the experiment out of Delhi and repeated it, this time in a city called Shivpuri in the center of India, where I was assured that nobody had ever taught anybody anything. (Laughter) So it was a warm day, and the hole in the wall was on that decrepit old building. This is the first kid who came there; he later on turned out to be a 13-year-old school dropout. He came there and he started to fiddle around with the touchpad. Very quickly, he noticed that when he moves his finger on the touchpad something moves on the screen \u2014 and later on he told me, \"I have never seen a television where you can do something.\" So he figured that out. It took him over two minutes to figure out that he was doing things to the television. And then, as he was doing that, he made an accidental click by hitting the touchpad \u2014 you'll see him do that. He did that, and the Internet Explorer changed page. Eight minutes later, he looked from his hand to the screen, and he was browsing: he was going back and forth. When that happened, he started calling all the neighborhood children, like, children would come and see what's happening over here. And by the evening of that day, 70 children were all browsing. So eight minutes and an embedded computer seemed to be all that we needed there.So we thought that this is what was happening: that children in groups can self-instruct themselves to use a computer and the Internet. But under what circumstances? At this time there was a \u2014 the main question was about English. People said, you know, you really ought to have this in Indian languages. So I said, have what, shall I translate the Internet into some Indian language? That's not possible. So, it has to be the other way about. But let's see, how do the children tackle the English language? I took the experiment out to northeastern India, to a village called Madantusi, where, for some reason, there was no English teacher, so the children had not learned English at all. And I built a similar hole-in-the-wall. One big difference in the villages, as opposed to the urban slums: there were more girls than boys who came to the kiosk. In the urban slums, the girls tend to stay away. I left the computer there with lots of CDs \u2014 I didn't have any Internet \u2014 and came back three months later. So when I came back there, I found these two kids, eight- and 12-year-olds, who were playing a game on the computer. And as soon as they saw me they said, \"We need a faster processor and a better mouse.\" (Laughter) I was real surprised. You know, how on earth did they know all this? And they said, \"Well, we've picked it up from the CDs.\" So I said, \"But how did you understand what's going on over there?\" So they said, \"Well, you've left this machine which talks only in English, so we had to learn English.\" So then I measured, and they were using 200 English words with each other \u2014 mispronounced, but correct usage \u2014 words like exit, stop, find, save, that kind of thing, not only to do with the computer but in their day-to-day conversations. So, Madantusi seemed to show that language is not a barrier; in fact they may be able to teach themselves the language if they really wanted to.Finally, I got some funding to try this experiment out to see if these results are replicable, if they happen everywhere else. India is a good place to do such an experiment in, because we have all the ethnic diversities, all the \u2014 you know, the genetic diversity, all the racial diversities, and also all the socio-economic diversities. So, I could actually choose samples to cover a cross section that would cover practically the whole world. So I did this for almost five years, and this experiment really took us all the way across the length and breadth of India. This is the Himalayas. Up in the north, very cold. I also had to check or invent an engineering design which would survive outdoors, and I was using regular, normal PCs, so I needed different climates, for which India is also great, because we have very cold, very hot, and so on. This is the desert to the west. Near the Pakistan border. And you see here a little clip of \u2014 one of these villages \u2014 the first thing that these children did was to find a website to teach themselves the English alphabet.Then to central India \u2014 very warm, moist, fishing villages, where humidity is a very big killer of electronics. So we had to solve all the problems we had without air conditioning and with very poor power, so most of the solutions that came out used little blasts of air put at the right places to keep the machines running. I want to just cut this short. We did this over and over again. This sequence is also nice. This is a small child, a six-year-old, telling his eldest sister what to do. And this happens very often with these computers, that the younger children are found teaching the older ones.What did we find? We found that six- to 13-year-olds can self-instruct in a connected environment, irrespective of anything that we could measure. So if they have access to the computer, they will teach themselves, including intelligence. I couldn't find a single correlation with anything, but it had to be in groups. And that may be of great, you know, interest to this group, because all of you are talking about groups. So here was the power of what a group of children can do, if you lift the adult intervention.Just a quick idea of the measurements. We took standard statistical techniques, so I'm going to not talk about that. But we got a clean learning curve, almost exactly the same as what you would get in a school. I'll leave it at that, because, I mean, it sort of says it all, doesn't it? What could they learn to do? Basic Windows functions, browsing, painting, chatting and email, games and educational material, music downloads, playing video. In short, what all of us do. And over 300 children will become computer literate and be able to do all of these things in six months with one computer.So, how do they do that? If you calculated the actual time of access, it would work out to minutes per day, so that's not how it's happening. What you have, actually, is there is one child operating the computer. And surrounding him are usually three other children, who are advising him on what they should do. If you test them, all four will get the same scores in whatever you ask them. Around these four are usually a group of about 16 children, who are also advising, usually wrongly, about everything that's going on on the computer. And all of them also will clear a test given on that subject. So they are learning as much by watching as they learn by doing. It seems counter-intuitive to adult learning, but remember, eight-year-olds live in a society where most of the time they are told, don't do this, you know, don't touch the whiskey bottle. So what does the eight-year-old do? He observes very carefully how a whiskey bottle should be touched. And if you tested him, he would answer every question correctly on that topic. So, they seem to be able to acquire very quickly.So what was the conclusion over the six years of work? It was that primary education can happen on its own, or parts of it can happen on its own. It does not have to be imposed from the top downwards. It could perhaps be a self-organizing system, so that was the second bit that I wanted to tell you, that children can self-organize and attain an educational objective.The third piece was on values, and again, to put it very briefly, I conducted a test over 500 children spread across all over India, and asked them \u2014 I gave them about 68 different values-oriented questions and simply asked them their opinions. We got all sorts of opinions. Yes, no or I don't know. I simply took those questions where I got 50 percent yeses and 50 percent noes \u2014 so I was able to get a collection of 16 such statements. These were areas where the children were clearly confused, because half said yes and half said no. A typical example being, \"Sometimes it is necessary to tell lies.\" They don't have a way to determine which way to answer this question; perhaps none of us do. So I leave you with this third question. Can technology alter the acquisition of values? Finally, self-organizing systems, about which, again, I won't say too much because you've been hearing all about it. Natural systems are all self-organizing: galaxies, molecules, cells, organisms, societies \u2014 except for the debate about an intelligent designer. But at this point in time, as far as science goes, it's self-organization. But other examples are traffic jams, stock market, society and disaster recovery, terrorism and insurgency. And you know about the Internet-based self-organizing systems.So here are my four sentences then. Remoteness affects the quality of education. Educational technology should be introduced into remote areas first, and other areas later. Values are acquired; doctrine and dogma are imposed \u2014 the two opposing mechanisms. And learning is most likely a self-organizing system. If you put all the four together, then it gives \u2014 according to me \u2014 it gives us a goal, a vision, for educational technology. An educational technology and pedagogy that is digital, automatic, fault-tolerant, minimally invasive, connected and self-organized. As educationists, we have never asked for technology; we keep borrowing it. PowerPoint is supposed to be considered a great educational technology, but it was not meant for education, it was meant for making boardroom presentations. We borrowed it. Video conferencing. The personal computer itself. I think it's time that the educationists made their own specs, and I have such a set of specs. This is a brief look at that. And such a set of specs should produce the technology to address remoteness, values and violence. So I thought I'd give it a name \u2014 why don't we call it \"outdoctrination.\" And could this be a goal for educational technology in the future? So I want to leave that as a thought with you.Thank you.(Applause)", "id": 175, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:11.958 --> 00:00:14.958\nI have a tough job to do.\n\n00:00:14.958 --> 00:00:20.958\nYou know, when I looked at the profile of the audience here,\n\n00:00:20.958 --> 00:00:27.958\nwith their connotations and design, in all its forms,\n\n00:00:27.958 --> 00:00:29.958\nand with so much and so many people working\n\n00:00:29.958 --> 00:00:34.958\non collaborative and networks, and so on, that I wanted to tell you,\n\n00:00:34.958 --> 00:00:39.958\nI wanted to build an argument for primary education\n\n00:00:39.958 --> 00:00:41.958\nin a very specific context.\n\n00:00:41.958 --> 00:00:45.958\nIn order to do that in 20 minutes, I have to bring out four ideas --\n\n00:00:45.958 --> 00:00:48.958\nit's like four pieces of a puzzle.\n\n00:00:48.958 --> 00:00:51.958\nAnd if I succeed in doing that,\n\n00:00:51.958 --> 00:00:54.958\nmaybe you would go back with the thought\n\n00:00:54.958 --> 00:00:57.958\nthat you could build on, and perhaps help me do my work.\n\n00:01:01.958 --> 00:01:04.958\nThe first piece of the puzzle is remoteness\n\n00:01:04.958 --> 00:01:06.958\nand the quality of education.\n\n00:01:06.958 --> 00:01:11.958\nNow, by remoteness, I mean two or three different kinds of things.\n\n00:01:11.958 --> 00:01:14.958\nOf course, remoteness in its normal sense, which means\n\n00:01:14.958 --> 00:01:17.958\nthat as you go further and further away\n\n00:01:17.958 --> 00:01:22.958\nfrom an urban center, you get to remoter areas.\n\n00:01:22.958 --> 00:01:25.958\nWhat happens to education?\n\n00:01:25.958 --> 00:01:27.958\nThe second, or a different kind of remoteness\n\n00:01:27.958 --> 00:01:32.958\nis that within the large metropolitan areas all over the world,\n\n00:01:32.958 --> 00:01:37.958\nyou have pockets, like slums, or shantytowns, or poorer areas,\n\n00:01:37.958 --> 00:01:41.958\nwhich are socially and economically remote\n\n00:01:41.958 --> 00:01:44.958\nfrom the rest of the city, so it's us and them.\n\n00:01:44.958 --> 00:01:46.958\nWhat happens to education in that context?\n\n00:01:46.958 --> 00:01:54.958\nSo keep both of those ideas of remoteness.\n\n00:01:54.958 --> 00:01:57.958\nWe made a guess. The guess was that schools in remote areas\n\n00:01:57.958 --> 00:02:00.958\ndo not have good enough teachers.\n\n00:02:00.958 --> 00:02:02.958\nIf they do have, they cannot retain those teachers.\n\n00:02:02.958 --> 00:02:05.958\nThey do not have good enough infrastructure.\n\n00:02:05.958 --> 00:02:07.958\nAnd if they had some infrastructure,\n\n00:02:07.958 --> 00:02:09.958\nthey have difficulty maintaining it.\n\n00:02:09.958 --> 00:02:14.958\nBut I wanted to check if this is true. So what I did last year was\n\n00:02:14.958 --> 00:02:19.958\nwe hired a car, looked up on Google,\n\n00:02:19.958 --> 00:02:24.958\nfound a route into northern India from New Delhi\n\n00:02:24.958 --> 00:02:29.958\nwhich, you know, which did not cross any big cities\n\n00:02:29.958 --> 00:02:35.958\nor any big metropolitan centers. Drove out about 300 kilometers,\n\n00:02:35.958 --> 00:02:40.958\nand wherever we found a school, administered a set of standard tests,\n\n00:02:40.958 --> 00:02:46.958\nand then took those test results and plotted them on a graph.\n\n00:02:46.958 --> 00:02:50.958\nThe graph was interesting, although you need to consider it carefully.\n\n00:02:50.958 --> 00:02:54.958\nI mean, this is a very small sample; you should not generalize from it.\n\n00:02:54.958 --> 00:02:56.958\nBut it was quite obvious, quite clear,\n\n00:02:56.958 --> 00:03:00.958\nthat for this particular route that I had taken,\n\n00:03:00.958 --> 00:03:05.958\nthe remoter the school was, the worse its results seemed to be.\n\n00:03:05.958 --> 00:03:07.958\nThat seemed a little damning,\n\n00:03:07.958 --> 00:03:12.958\nand I tried to correlate it with things like infrastructure,\n\n00:03:12.958 --> 00:03:15.958\nor with the availability of electricity, and things like that.\n\n00:03:15.958 --> 00:03:18.958\nTo my surprise, it did not correlate.\n\n00:03:18.958 --> 00:03:21.958\nIt did not correlate with the size of classrooms.\n\n00:03:21.958 --> 00:03:26.958\nIt did not correlate with the quality of the infrastructure.\n\n00:03:26.958 --> 00:03:30.958\nIt did not correlate with the poverty levels. It did not correlate.\n\n00:03:30.958 --> 00:03:34.958\nBut what happened was that when I administered a questionnaire\n\n00:03:34.958 --> 00:03:38.958\nto each of these schools, with one single question for the teachers -- which was,\n\n00:03:38.958 --> 00:03:43.958\n\"Would you like to move to an urban, metropolitan area?\" --\n\n00:03:43.958 --> 00:03:48.958\n69 percent of them said yes. And as you can see from that,\n\n00:03:48.958 --> 00:03:54.958\nthey say yes just a little bit out of Delhi,\n\n00:03:54.958 --> 00:03:57.958\nand they say no when you hit the rich suburbs of Delhi --\n\n00:03:57.958 --> 00:04:00.958\nbecause, you know, those are relatively better off areas --\n\n00:04:00.958 --> 00:04:04.958\nand then from 200 kilometers out of Delhi, the answer is consistently yes.\n\n00:04:04.958 --> 00:04:07.958\nI would imagine that a teacher who comes or walks into class\n\n00:04:07.958 --> 00:04:11.958\nevery day thinking that, I wish I was in some other school,\n\n00:04:11.958 --> 00:04:15.958\nprobably has a deep impact on what happens to the results.\n\n00:04:15.958 --> 00:04:20.958\nSo it looked as though teacher motivation and teacher migration\n\n00:04:20.958 --> 00:04:25.958\nwas a powerfully correlated thing with what was happening in primary schools,\n\n00:04:25.958 --> 00:04:28.958\nas opposed to whether the children have enough to eat,\n\n00:04:28.958 --> 00:04:30.958\nand whether they are packed tightly into classrooms\n\n00:04:30.958 --> 00:04:34.958\nand that sort of thing. It appears that way.\n\n00:04:34.958 --> 00:04:39.958\nWhen you take education and technology, then I find in the literature that,\n\n00:04:39.958 --> 00:04:42.958\nyou know, things like websites, collaborative environments --\n\n00:04:42.958 --> 00:04:44.958\nyou've been listening to all that in the morning --\n\n00:04:44.958 --> 00:04:50.958\nit's always piloted first in the best schools, the best urban schools,\n\n00:04:50.958 --> 00:04:53.958\nand, according to me, biases the result.\n\n00:04:53.958 --> 00:04:57.958\nThe literature -- one part of it, the scientific literature --\n\n00:04:57.958 --> 00:05:02.958\nconsistently blames ET as being over-hyped and under-performing.\n\n00:05:02.958 --> 00:05:08.958\nThe teachers always say, well, it's fine, but it's too expensive for what it does.\n\n00:05:08.958 --> 00:05:11.958\nBecause it's being piloted in a school where the students are already getting,\n\n00:05:11.958 --> 00:05:14.958\nlet's say, 80 percent of whatever they could do.\n\n00:05:14.958 --> 00:05:18.958\nYou put in this new super-duper technology, and now they get 83 percent.\n\n00:05:18.958 --> 00:05:20.958\nSo the principal looks at it and says,\n\n00:05:20.958 --> 00:05:23.958\n3 percent for 300,000 dollars? Forget it.\n\n00:05:23.958 --> 00:05:28.958\nIf you took the same technology and piloted it into one of those remote schools,\n\n00:05:28.958 --> 00:05:33.958\nwhere the score was 30 percent, and, let's say, took that up to 40 percent --\n\n00:05:33.958 --> 00:05:35.958\nthat will be a completely different thing.\n\n00:05:35.958 --> 00:05:39.958\nSo the relative change that ET, Educational Technology, would make,\n\n00:05:39.958 --> 00:05:42.958\nwould be far greater at the bottom of the pyramid than at the top,\n\n00:05:42.958 --> 00:05:45.958\nbut we seem to be doing it the other way about.\n\n00:05:45.958 --> 00:05:48.958\nSo I came to this conclusion that ET should reach\n\n00:05:48.958 --> 00:05:51.958\nthe underprivileged first, not the other way about.\n\n00:05:51.958 --> 00:05:54.958\nAnd finally came the question of, how do you tackle teacher perception?\n\n00:05:54.958 --> 00:05:56.958\nWhenever you go to a teacher and show them some technology,\n\n00:05:56.958 --> 00:05:58.958\nthe teacher's first reaction is,\n\n00:05:58.958 --> 00:06:04.958\nyou cannot replace a teacher with a machine -- it's impossible.\n\n00:06:04.958 --> 00:06:06.958\nI don't know why it's impossible, but, even for a moment,\n\n00:06:06.958 --> 00:06:11.958\nif you did assume that it's impossible -- I have a quotation from Sir Arthur C. Clarke,\n\n00:06:11.958 --> 00:06:15.958\nthe science fiction writer whom I met in Colombo,\n\n00:06:15.958 --> 00:06:19.958\nand he said something which completely solves this problem.\n\n00:06:19.958 --> 00:06:25.958\nHe said a teacher than can be replaced by a machine, should be.\n\n00:06:25.958 --> 00:06:31.958\nSo, you know, it puts the teacher into a tough bind, you have to think.\n\n00:06:31.958 --> 00:06:34.958\nAnyway, so I'm proposing that an alternative primary education,\n\n00:06:34.958 --> 00:06:39.958\nwhatever alternative you want, is required where schools don't exist,\n\n00:06:39.958 --> 00:06:42.958\nwhere schools are not good enough, where teachers are not available\n\n00:06:42.958 --> 00:06:45.958\nor where teachers are not good enough, for whatever reason.\n\n00:06:45.958 --> 00:06:49.958\nIf you happen to live in a part of the world where none of this applies,\n\n00:06:49.958 --> 00:06:51.958\nthen you don't need an alternative education.\n\n00:06:51.958 --> 00:06:57.958\nSo far I haven't come across such an area, except for one case. I won't name the area,\n\n00:06:57.958 --> 00:07:00.958\nbut somewhere in the world people said, we don't have this problem,\n\n00:07:00.958 --> 00:07:04.958\nbecause we have perfect teachers and perfect schools.\n\n00:07:04.958 --> 00:07:10.958\nThere are such areas, but -- anyway, I'd never heard that anywhere else.\n\n00:07:10.958 --> 00:07:13.958\nI'm going to talk about children and self-organization,\n\n00:07:13.958 --> 00:07:17.958\nand a set of experiments which sort of led to this idea\n\n00:07:17.958 --> 00:07:21.958\nof what might an alternative education be like.\n\n00:07:21.958 --> 00:07:23.958\nThey're called the hole-in-the-wall experiments.\n\n00:07:23.958 --> 00:07:28.958\nI'll have to really rush through this. They're a set of experiments.\n\n00:07:28.958 --> 00:07:34.958\nThe first one was done in New Delhi in 1999.\n\n00:07:34.958 --> 00:07:38.958\nAnd what we did over there was pretty much simple.\n\n00:07:38.958 --> 00:07:42.958\nI had an office in those days which bordered a slum, an urban slum,\n\n00:07:42.958 --> 00:07:46.958\nso there was a dividing wall between our office and the urban slum.\n\n00:07:46.958 --> 00:07:48.958\nThey cut a hole inside that wall --\n\n00:07:48.958 --> 00:07:50.958\nwhich is how it has got the name hole-in-the-wall --\n\n00:07:50.958 --> 00:07:55.958\nand put a pretty powerful PC into that hole, sort of embedded into the wall\n\n00:07:55.958 --> 00:07:58.958\nso that its monitor was sticking out at the other end,\n\n00:07:58.958 --> 00:08:01.958\na touchpad similarly embedded into the wall,\n\n00:08:01.958 --> 00:08:07.958\nput it on high-speed Internet, put the Internet Explorer there,\n\n00:08:07.958 --> 00:08:10.958\nput it on Altavista.com -- in those days -- and just left it there.\n\n00:08:10.958 --> 00:08:15.958\nAnd this is what we saw.\n\n00:08:15.958 --> 00:08:24.958\nSo that was my office in IIT. Here's the hole-in-the-wall.\n\n00:08:24.958 --> 00:08:30.958\nAbout eight hours later, we found this kid.\n\n00:08:30.958 --> 00:08:35.958\nTo the right is this eight-year-old child who --\n\n00:08:35.958 --> 00:08:40.958\nand to his left is a six-year-old girl, who is not very tall.\n\n00:08:40.958 --> 00:08:44.958\nAnd what he was doing was, he was teaching her to browse.\n\n00:08:44.958 --> 00:08:49.958\nSo it sort of raised more questions than it answered.\n\n00:08:49.958 --> 00:08:51.958\nIs this real? Does the language matter,\n\n00:08:51.958 --> 00:08:53.958\nbecause he's not supposed to know English?\n\n00:08:53.958 --> 00:08:56.958\nWill the computer last, or will they break it and steal it\n\n00:08:56.958 --> 00:08:58.958\n-- and did anyone teach them?\n\n00:08:58.958 --> 00:09:00.958\nThe last question is what everybody said, but you know,\n\n00:09:00.958 --> 00:09:02.958\nI mean, they must have poked their head over the wall\n\n00:09:02.958 --> 00:09:04.958\nand asked the people in your office,\n\n00:09:04.958 --> 00:09:07.958\ncan you show me how to do it, and then somebody taught him.\n\n00:09:07.958 --> 00:09:10.958\nSo I took the experiment out of Delhi and repeated it,\n\n00:09:10.958 --> 00:09:16.958\nthis time in a city called Shivpuri in the center of India,\n\n00:09:16.958 --> 00:09:21.958\nwhere I was assured that nobody had ever taught anybody anything.\n\n00:09:21.958 --> 00:09:25.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:09:25.958 --> 00:09:30.958\nSo it was a warm day, and the hole in the wall\n\n00:09:30.958 --> 00:09:35.958\nwas on that decrepit old building. This is the first kid who came there;\n\n00:09:35.958 --> 00:09:37.958\nhe later on turned out to be a 13-year-old school dropout.\n\n00:09:37.958 --> 00:09:43.958\nHe came there and he started to fiddle around with the touchpad.\n\n00:09:43.958 --> 00:09:46.958\nVery quickly, he noticed that when he moves his finger on the touchpad\n\n00:09:46.958 --> 00:09:47.958\nsomething moves on the screen --\n\n00:09:47.958 --> 00:09:50.958\nand later on he told me, \"I have never seen a television\n\n00:09:50.958 --> 00:09:51.958\nwhere you can do something.\"\n\n00:09:51.958 --> 00:09:54.958\nSo he figured that out. It took him over two minutes\n\n00:09:54.958 --> 00:09:57.958\nto figure out that he was doing things to the television.\n\n00:09:57.958 --> 00:10:00.958\nAnd then, as he was doing that, he made an accidental click\n\n00:10:00.958 --> 00:10:07.958\nby hitting the touchpad -- you'll see him do that.\n\n00:10:07.958 --> 00:10:13.958\nHe did that, and the Internet Explorer changed page.\n\n00:10:13.958 --> 00:10:17.958\nEight minutes later, he looked from his hand to the screen,\n\n00:10:17.958 --> 00:10:21.958\nand he was browsing: he was going back and forth.\n\n00:10:21.958 --> 00:10:26.958\nWhen that happened, he started calling all the neighborhood children,\n\n00:10:26.958 --> 00:10:33.958\nlike, children would come and see what's happening over here.\n\n00:10:33.958 --> 00:10:37.958\nAnd by the evening of that day, 70 children were all browsing.\n\n00:10:37.958 --> 00:10:41.958\nSo eight minutes and an embedded computer\n\n00:10:41.958 --> 00:10:45.958\nseemed to be all that we needed there.\n\n00:10:45.958 --> 00:10:48.958\nSo we thought that this is what was happening:\n\n00:10:48.958 --> 00:10:51.958\nthat children in groups can self-instruct themselves\n\n00:10:51.958 --> 00:10:59.958\nto use a computer and the Internet. But under what circumstances?\n\n00:10:59.958 --> 00:11:05.958\nAt this time there was a -- the main question was about English.\n\n00:11:05.958 --> 00:11:09.958\nPeople said, you know, you really ought to have this in Indian languages.\n\n00:11:09.958 --> 00:11:12.958\nSo I said, have what, shall I translate the Internet\n\n00:11:12.958 --> 00:11:15.958\ninto some Indian language? That's not possible.\n\n00:11:15.958 --> 00:11:17.958\nSo, it has to be the other way about.\n\n00:11:17.958 --> 00:11:21.958\nBut let's see, how do the children tackle the English language?\n\n00:11:21.958 --> 00:11:24.958\nI took the experiment out to northeastern India,\n\n00:11:24.958 --> 00:11:26.958\nto a village called Madantusi,\n\n00:11:26.958 --> 00:11:30.958\nwhere, for some reason, there was no English teacher,\n\n00:11:30.958 --> 00:11:33.958\nso the children had not learned English at all.\n\n00:11:33.958 --> 00:11:37.958\nAnd I built a similar hole-in-the-wall.\n\n00:11:37.958 --> 00:11:39.958\nOne big difference in the villages, as opposed to the urban slums:\n\n00:11:39.958 --> 00:11:43.958\nthere were more girls than boys who came to the kiosk.\n\n00:11:43.958 --> 00:11:47.958\nIn the urban slums, the girls tend to stay away.\n\n00:11:47.958 --> 00:11:52.958\nI left the computer there with lots of CDs -- I didn't have any Internet --\n\n00:11:52.958 --> 00:11:56.958\nand came back three months later.\n\n00:11:56.958 --> 00:12:00.958\nSo when I came back there, I found these two kids,\n\n00:12:00.958 --> 00:12:04.958\neight- and 12-year-olds, who were playing a game on the computer.\n\n00:12:04.958 --> 00:12:08.958\nAnd as soon as they saw me they said,\n\n00:12:08.958 --> 00:12:11.958\n\"We need a faster processor and a better mouse.\"\n\n00:12:11.958 --> 00:12:15.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:12:15.958 --> 00:12:17.958\nI was real surprised.\n\n00:12:17.958 --> 00:12:20.958\nYou know, how on earth did they know all this?\n\n00:12:20.958 --> 00:12:22.958\nAnd they said, \"Well, we've picked it up from the CDs.\"\n\n00:12:22.958 --> 00:12:25.958\nSo I said, \"But how did you understand what's going on over there?\"\n\n00:12:25.958 --> 00:12:27.958\nSo they said, \"Well, you've left this machine\n\n00:12:27.958 --> 00:12:30.958\nwhich talks only in English, so we had to learn English.\"\n\n00:12:30.958 --> 00:12:34.958\nSo then I measured, and they were using 200 English words with each other\n\n00:12:34.958 --> 00:12:37.958\n-- mispronounced, but correct usage --\n\n00:12:37.958 --> 00:12:43.958\nwords like exit, stop, find, save, that kind of thing,\n\n00:12:43.958 --> 00:12:46.958\nnot only to do with the computer but in their day-to-day conversations.\n\n00:12:46.958 --> 00:12:50.958\nSo, Madantusi seemed to show that language is not a barrier;\n\n00:12:50.958 --> 00:12:52.958\nin fact they may be able to teach themselves the language\n\n00:12:52.958 --> 00:12:55.958\nif they really wanted to.\n\n00:12:55.958 --> 00:13:00.958\nFinally, I got some funding to try this experiment out\n\n00:13:00.958 --> 00:13:04.958\nto see if these results are replicable, if they happen everywhere else.\n\n00:13:04.958 --> 00:13:07.958\nIndia is a good place to do such an experiment in,\n\n00:13:07.958 --> 00:13:10.958\nbecause we have all the ethnic diversities, all the -- you know,\n\n00:13:10.958 --> 00:13:13.958\nthe genetic diversity, all the racial diversities,\n\n00:13:13.958 --> 00:13:15.958\nand also all the socio-economic diversities.\n\n00:13:15.958 --> 00:13:20.958\nSo, I could actually choose samples to cover a cross section\n\n00:13:20.958 --> 00:13:24.958\nthat would cover practically the whole world.\n\n00:13:24.958 --> 00:13:28.958\nSo I did this for almost five years, and this experiment\n\n00:13:28.958 --> 00:13:31.958\nreally took us all the way across the length and breadth of India.\n\n00:13:31.958 --> 00:13:34.958\nThis is the Himalayas. Up in the north, very cold.\n\n00:13:34.958 --> 00:13:37.958\nI also had to check or invent an engineering design\n\n00:13:37.958 --> 00:13:41.958\nwhich would survive outdoors, and I was using regular, normal PCs,\n\n00:13:41.958 --> 00:13:44.958\nso I needed different climates, for which India is also great,\n\n00:13:44.958 --> 00:13:47.958\nbecause we have very cold, very hot, and so on.\n\n00:13:47.958 --> 00:13:59.958\nThis is the desert to the west. Near the Pakistan border.\n\n00:13:59.958 --> 00:14:03.958\nAnd you see here a little clip of -- one of these villages --\n\n00:14:03.958 --> 00:14:06.958\nthe first thing that these children did was to find a website\n\n00:14:06.958 --> 00:14:10.958\nto teach themselves the English alphabet.\n\n00:14:10.958 --> 00:14:14.958\nThen to central India -- very warm, moist, fishing villages,\n\n00:14:14.958 --> 00:14:18.958\nwhere humidity is a very big killer of electronics.\n\n00:14:18.958 --> 00:14:21.958\nSo we had to solve all the problems we had\n\n00:14:21.958 --> 00:14:23.958\nwithout air conditioning and with very poor power,\n\n00:14:23.958 --> 00:14:28.958\nso most of the solutions that came out used little blasts of air\n\n00:14:28.958 --> 00:14:31.958\nput at the right places to keep the machines running.\n\n00:14:31.958 --> 00:14:36.958\nI want to just cut this short. We did this over and over again.\n\n00:14:36.958 --> 00:14:40.958\nThis sequence is also nice. This is a small child, a six-year-old,\n\n00:14:40.958 --> 00:14:42.958\ntelling his eldest sister what to do.\n\n00:14:42.958 --> 00:14:44.958\nAnd this happens very often with these computers,\n\n00:14:44.958 --> 00:14:50.958\nthat the younger children are found teaching the older ones.\n\n00:14:50.958 --> 00:14:55.958\nWhat did we find? We found that six- to 13-year-olds can self-instruct\n\n00:14:55.958 --> 00:14:57.958\nin a connected environment,\n\n00:14:57.958 --> 00:15:02.958\nirrespective of anything that we could measure.\n\n00:15:02.958 --> 00:15:07.958\nSo if they have access to the computer, they will teach themselves, including intelligence.\n\n00:15:07.958 --> 00:15:12.958\nI couldn't find a single correlation with anything, but it had to be in groups.\n\n00:15:12.958 --> 00:15:16.958\nAnd that may be of great, you know, interest to this group,\n\n00:15:16.958 --> 00:15:18.958\nbecause all of you are talking about groups.\n\n00:15:18.958 --> 00:15:22.958\nSo here was the power of what a group of children can do,\n\n00:15:22.958 --> 00:15:25.958\nif you lift the adult intervention.\n\n00:15:25.958 --> 00:15:29.958\nJust a quick idea of the measurements.\n\n00:15:29.958 --> 00:15:33.958\nWe took standard statistical techniques, so I'm going to not talk about that.\n\n00:15:33.958 --> 00:15:36.958\nBut we got a clean learning curve,\n\n00:15:36.958 --> 00:15:39.958\nalmost exactly the same as what you would get in a school.\n\n00:15:39.958 --> 00:15:41.958\nI'll leave it at that,\n\n00:15:41.958 --> 00:15:44.958\nbecause, I mean, it sort of says it all, doesn't it?\n\n00:15:44.958 --> 00:15:46.958\nWhat could they learn to do?\n\n00:15:46.958 --> 00:15:51.958\nBasic Windows functions, browsing, painting, chatting and email,\n\n00:15:51.958 --> 00:15:54.958\ngames and educational material, music downloads, playing video.\n\n00:15:54.958 --> 00:15:56.958\nIn short, what all of us do.\n\n00:15:56.958 --> 00:16:00.958\nAnd over 300 children will become computer literate\n\n00:16:00.958 --> 00:16:05.958\nand be able to do all of these things in six months with one computer.\n\n00:16:05.958 --> 00:16:06.958\nSo, how do they do that?\n\n00:16:06.958 --> 00:16:08.958\nIf you calculated the actual time of access,\n\n00:16:08.958 --> 00:16:10.958\nit would work out to minutes per day,\n\n00:16:10.958 --> 00:16:12.958\nso that's not how it's happening.\n\n00:16:12.958 --> 00:16:17.958\nWhat you have, actually, is there is one child operating the computer.\n\n00:16:17.958 --> 00:16:19.958\nAnd surrounding him are usually three other children,\n\n00:16:19.958 --> 00:16:23.958\nwho are advising him on what they should do.\n\n00:16:23.958 --> 00:16:27.958\nIf you test them, all four will get the same scores in whatever you ask them.\n\n00:16:27.958 --> 00:16:31.958\nAround these four are usually a group of about 16 children,\n\n00:16:31.958 --> 00:16:34.958\nwho are also advising, usually wrongly,\n\n00:16:34.958 --> 00:16:37.958\nabout everything that's going on on the computer.\n\n00:16:37.958 --> 00:16:42.958\nAnd all of them also will clear a test given on that subject.\n\n00:16:42.958 --> 00:16:46.958\nSo they are learning as much by watching as they learn by doing.\n\n00:16:46.958 --> 00:16:49.958\nIt seems counter-intuitive to adult learning,\n\n00:16:49.958 --> 00:16:51.958\nbut remember, eight-year-olds live in a society\n\n00:16:51.958 --> 00:16:55.958\nwhere most of the time they are told, don't do this,\n\n00:16:55.958 --> 00:16:57.958\nyou know, don't touch the whiskey bottle.\n\n00:16:57.958 --> 00:16:59.958\nSo what does the eight-year-old do?\n\n00:16:59.958 --> 00:17:03.958\nHe observes very carefully how a whiskey bottle should be touched.\n\n00:17:03.958 --> 00:17:04.958\nAnd if you tested him,\n\n00:17:04.958 --> 00:17:06.958\nhe would answer every question correctly on that topic.\n\n00:17:06.958 --> 00:17:12.958\nSo, they seem to be able to acquire very quickly.\n\n00:17:12.958 --> 00:17:15.958\nSo what was the conclusion over the six years of work?\n\n00:17:15.958 --> 00:17:19.958\nIt was that primary education can happen on its own,\n\n00:17:19.958 --> 00:17:21.958\nor parts of it can happen on its own.\n\n00:17:21.958 --> 00:17:25.958\nIt does not have to be imposed from the top downwards.\n\n00:17:25.958 --> 00:17:31.958\nIt could perhaps be a self-organizing system, so that was\n\n00:17:31.958 --> 00:17:33.958\nthe second bit that I wanted to tell you,\n\n00:17:33.958 --> 00:17:37.958\nthat children can self-organize and attain an educational objective.\n\n00:17:37.958 --> 00:17:43.958\nThe third piece was on values, and again, to put it very briefly,\n\n00:17:43.958 --> 00:17:47.958\nI conducted a test over 500 children spread across all over India,\n\n00:17:47.958 --> 00:17:50.958\nand asked them -- I gave them about 68 different\n\n00:17:50.958 --> 00:17:54.958\nvalues-oriented questions and simply asked them their opinions.\n\n00:17:54.958 --> 00:17:58.958\nWe got all sorts of opinions. Yes, no or I don't know.\n\n00:17:58.958 --> 00:18:04.958\nI simply took those questions where I got 50 percent yeses and 50 percent noes --\n\n00:18:04.958 --> 00:18:08.958\nso I was able to get a collection of 16 such statements.\n\n00:18:08.958 --> 00:18:12.958\nThese were areas where the children were clearly confused,\n\n00:18:12.958 --> 00:18:14.958\nbecause half said yes and half said no.\n\n00:18:14.958 --> 00:18:18.958\nA typical example being, \"Sometimes it is necessary to tell lies.\"\n\n00:18:18.958 --> 00:18:23.958\nThey don't have a way to determine which way to answer this question;\n\n00:18:23.958 --> 00:18:26.958\nperhaps none of us do.\n\n00:18:26.958 --> 00:18:28.958\nSo I leave you with this third question.\n\n00:18:28.958 --> 00:18:32.958\nCan technology alter the acquisition of values?\n\n00:18:32.958 --> 00:18:34.958\nFinally, self-organizing systems,\n\n00:18:34.958 --> 00:18:36.958\nabout which, again, I won't say too much\n\n00:18:36.958 --> 00:18:40.958\nbecause you've been hearing all about it.\n\n00:18:40.958 --> 00:18:42.958\nNatural systems are all self-organizing:\n\n00:18:42.958 --> 00:18:45.958\ngalaxies, molecules, cells, organisms, societies --\n\n00:18:45.958 --> 00:18:47.958\nexcept for the debate about an intelligent designer.\n\n00:18:47.958 --> 00:18:50.958\nBut at this point in time, as far as science goes,\n\n00:18:50.958 --> 00:18:52.958\nit's self-organization.\n\n00:18:52.958 --> 00:18:55.958\nBut other examples are traffic jams, stock market, society\n\n00:18:55.958 --> 00:19:01.958\nand disaster recovery, terrorism and insurgency.\n\n00:19:01.958 --> 00:19:05.958\nAnd you know about the Internet-based self-organizing systems.\n\n00:19:05.958 --> 00:19:07.958\nSo here are my four sentences then.\n\n00:19:07.958 --> 00:19:11.958\nRemoteness affects the quality of education.\n\n00:19:11.958 --> 00:19:17.958\nEducational technology should be introduced into remote areas first,\n\n00:19:17.958 --> 00:19:20.958\nand other areas later.\n\n00:19:20.958 --> 00:19:26.958\nValues are acquired; doctrine and dogma are imposed --\n\n00:19:26.958 --> 00:19:28.958\nthe two opposing mechanisms.\n\n00:19:28.958 --> 00:19:33.958\nAnd learning is most likely a self-organizing system.\n\n00:19:33.958 --> 00:19:38.958\nIf you put all the four together, then it gives -- according to me --\n\n00:19:38.958 --> 00:19:42.958\nit gives us a goal, a vision, for educational technology.\n\n00:19:42.958 --> 00:19:48.958\nAn educational technology and pedagogy that is digital, automatic,\n\n00:19:48.958 --> 00:19:54.958\nfault-tolerant, minimally invasive, connected and self-organized.\n\n00:19:54.958 --> 00:19:58.958\nAs educationists, we have never asked for technology; we keep borrowing it.\n\n00:19:58.958 --> 00:20:02.958\nPowerPoint is supposed to be considered a great educational technology,\n\n00:20:02.958 --> 00:20:06.958\nbut it was not meant for education, it was meant for making boardroom presentations.\n\n00:20:06.958 --> 00:20:10.958\nWe borrowed it. Video conferencing. The personal computer itself.\n\n00:20:10.958 --> 00:20:13.958\nI think it's time that the educationists made their own specs,\n\n00:20:13.958 --> 00:20:17.958\nand I have such a set of specs. This is a brief look at that.\n\n00:20:17.958 --> 00:20:21.958\nAnd such a set of specs should produce the technology\n\n00:20:21.958 --> 00:20:24.958\nto address remoteness, values and violence.\n\n00:20:24.958 --> 00:20:30.958\nSo I thought I'd give it a name -- why don't we call it \"outdoctrination.\"\n\n00:20:30.958 --> 00:20:35.958\nAnd could this be a goal for educational technology in the future?\n\n00:20:35.958 --> 00:20:38.958\nSo I want to leave that as a thought with you.\n\n00:20:38.958 --> 00:20:39.958\nThank you.\n\n00:20:39.958 --> 00:20:45.958\n(Applause)"}, {"title": "How I became an activist", "duration": "998", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/ory_okolloh_on_becoming_an_activist", "transcript": "So what's image got do with it? And I must say, I think Emeka is trying to send a lot of subliminal messages, because I'm going to keep harping on some of the issues that have come up. But I'm going to try and do something different, and try and just close the loop with some of my personal stories, and try and put a face to a lot of the issues that we've been talking about. So, Africa is a complex continent full of contradictions, as you can see. We're not the only ones.(Laughter)(Applause)And you know, it's amazing. I mean, we need a whole conference just devoted to telling the good stories about the continent. Just think about that, you know? And this is typically what we've been talking about, the role that the media plays in focusing just on the negative stuff. Now, why is that a problem? A typical disaster story: disease, corruption, poverty. And some of you might be standing here thinking, saying, \"OK, you know, Ory, you're Harvard-educated, and all you privileged people come here, saying, 'Forget the poor people. Let's focus on business and the markets, and whatever.' \" And they're all, \"There's the 80 percent of Africans who really need help.\"And I want to tell you that this is my story, OK? And it's the story of many of the Africans who are here. We start with poverty. I didn't grow up in the slums or anything that dire, but I know what it is to grow up without having money, or being able to support family. Euvin was talking about bellwether signs. The bellwether for whether our family was broke or not was breakfast. You know, when things were good, we had eggs and sausages. When things were bad, we had porridge. And like many African families, my parents could never save because they supported siblings, cousins, you know, their parents, and things were always dicey. Now, when I was born, they realized they had a pretty smart kid, and they didn't want me to go to the neighborhood school, which was free.And they adopted a very interesting approach to education, which was they were going to take me to a school that they can barely afford. So they took me to a private, Catholic, elementary school, which set the foundation for what ended up being my career. And what happened was, because they could afford it sometimes, sometimes not, I got kicked out pretty much every term. You know, someone would come in with a list of the people who haven't paid school fees, and when they started getting pretty strict, you had to leave, until your school fees could be paid. And I remember thinking, I mean, why don't these guys just take me to a cheap school? Because you know, as a kid you're embarrassed and you're sensitive, and everyone knows you guys don't have money. But they kept at it, and I now understand why they did what they did.They talk about corruption. In Kenya, we have an entrance exam to go into high school. And there's national schools, which are like the best schools, and provincial schools. My dream school at that time was Kenya High School, a national school. I missed the cutoff by one point. And I was so disappointed, and I was like, \"Oh my God, you know, what am I going to do?\" And my father said, \"OK, listen. Let's go and try and talk to the headmistress. You know, it's just one point. I mean, maybe she'll let you in if that slot's still there.\" So we went to the school, and because we were nobodies, and because we didn't have privilege, and because my father didn't have the right last name, he was treated like dirt. And I sat and listened to the headmistress talk to him, saying, you know, who do you think you are? And, you know, you must be joking if you think you can get a slot. And I had gone to school with other girls, who were kids of politicians, and who had done much, much worse than I did, and they had slots there. And there's nothing worse than seeing your parent being humiliated in front of you, you know? And we left, and I swore to myself, and I was like, \"I'm never, ever going to have to beg for anything in my life.\" They called me two weeks later, they're like, oh, yeah, you can come now. And I told them to stuff it.(Laughter) (Applause)Final story, and I sort of have to speak quickly. Disease. My father, who I've been talking about, died of AIDS in 1999. He never told anyone that he had AIDS, his fear of the stigma was so strong. And I'm pretty much the one who figured it out, because I was a nerd. And I was in the States at the time, and they called me. He was very sick, the first time he got sick. And he had Cryptococcal meningitis. And so I went on to Google, Cryptococcal meningitis, you know. Because of doctor-patient privilege, they couldn't really tell us what was going on. But they were like, you know, this is a long-term thing. And when I went online and looked at the infectious \u2014 read about the disease, I pretty much realized what was going on.The first time he got sick, he recovered. But what happened was that he had to be on medication that, at that time \u2014 Diflucan, which in the States is used for yeast infections \u2014 cost 30 dollars a pill. He had to be on that pill for the rest of his life. You know, so money ran out. He got sick again. And up until that time, he had a friend who used to travel to India, and he used to import, bring him, could get him a generic version of it. And that kept him going. But the money ran out. He got sick again. He got sick on a Friday. At that time, there was only one bank that had ATMs in Kenya, and we could not get cash. The family couldn't get cash for him to start the treatment until Monday. The hospital put him on a water drip for three days. And finally, we figured, well, OK, we'd better just try and take him to a public hospital. At least he'll get treated while we try to figure out the money situation. And he died when the ambulance was coming to the hospital to take him.And, you know, now, imagine if \u2014 and I could go on and on \u2014 imagine if this is all you know about me. How would you look at me? With pity, you know. Sadness. And this is how you look at Africa. This is the damage it causes. You don't see the other side of me. You don't see the blogger, you don't see the Harvard-educated lawyer, the vibrant person, you know? And I just wanted to personalize that. Because we talk about it in big terms, and you wonder, you know, so what? But it's damaging. And I'm not unique, right? Imagine if all you knew about William was the fact that he grew up in a poor village. And you didn't know about the windmill, you know? And I was just moved. I was actually crying during his presentation. He was like, I try and I make. I was like Nike should hire him, you know, \"Just do it!\"(Laughter)And this is, again, the point I'm trying to make. When you focus just on the disasters \u2014 (Laughter) (Applause) \u2014 we're ignoring the potential. So, what is to be done? First of all, Africans, we need to get better at telling our stories. We heard about that yesterday. We had some of them this morning. And this is an example, you know, blogging is one way of doing that. Afrigator is an aggregator of African blogs that was developed in South Africa. So we need to start getting better. If no one else will tell our stories, let's do it. And going back to the point I was trying to make, this is the Swahili Wikipedia. Swahili is spoken by about 50 million people in East Africa. It only has five contributors. Four of them are white males \u2014 non-native speakers. The other person is \u2014 Ndesanjo, if you're here, stand up \u2014 is a Tanzanian, [the] first Swahili blogger. He's the only African who's contributing to this.People, please. We can't whine and complain the West is doing this. What are we doing? Where are the rest of the Swahili speakers? Why are we not generating our own content? You know, it's not enough to complain. We need to act. Reuters now integrates African blogs into their coverage of Africa. So, that's a start, and we've heard of all their other initiatives. The cheetah generation. The aid approach, you know, is flawed. And after all the hoopla of Live 8, we're still not anywhere in the picture. No, you're not.(Laughter)But the point I'm trying to make, though, is that it's not enough for us to criticize. And for those of you in the diaspora who are struggling with where should I be, should I move back, should I stay? You know, just jump. The continent needs you. And I can't emphasize that enough, you know. I walked away from a job with one of the top firms in D.C., Covington and Burling, six figures. With two paychecks, or three paychecks, I could solve a lot of my family's problems. But I walked away from that, because my passion was here, and because I wanted to do things that were fulfilling. And because I'm needed here, you know? I probably can win a prize for the most ways to use a Harvard Law School degree because of all the things I'm doing.One is because I'm pretty aggressive, and I try and find, you know, opportunities. But there is such a need, you know? I'm a corporate lawyer most of the time for an organization called Enablis that supports entrepreneurs in South Africa. We're now moving into East Africa. And we give them business development services, as well as financing loan and equity. I've also set up a project in Kenya, and what we do is we track the performance of Kenyan MPs. My partner, M, who's a tech guru, hacked WordPress. It costs us, like, 20 dollars a month just for hosting. Everything else on there is a labor of love. We've manually entered all the data there. And you can get profiles of each MP, questions they've asked in parliament. We have a comment function, where people can ask their MPs questions. There are some MPs who participate, and come back and ask.And basically, we started this because we were tired of complaining about our politicians. You know, I believe that accountability stems from demand. You're not just going to be accountable out of the goodness of your heart. And we as Africans need to start challenging our leaders. What are they doing? You know, they're not going to change just out of nowhere. So we need new policies, we need \u2014 where's that coming from, you know? Another thing is that these leaders are a reflection of our society. We talk about African governments like they've been dropped from Mars, you know? They come from us. And what is it about our society that is generating leaders that we don't like? And how can we change that? So Mzalendo was one small way we thought we could start inspiring people to start holding their leaders accountable. Where do we go from here? I believe in the power of ideas. I believe in the power of sharing knowledge.And I'd ask all of you, when you leave here, please just share, and keep the ideas that you've gotten out of here going, because it can make a difference. The other thing I want to urge you to do is take an interest in the individual. I've had lots of conversations about things I think need to be happening in Africa. People are like, \"OK, if you don't do aid, I'm a bleeding heart liberal, what can I do?\" And when I talk about my ideas, they're like, \"BBut it's not scalable, you know. Give me something I can do with Paypal.\" It's not that easy, you know? And sometimes just taking an interest in the individual, in the fellows you've met, and the businesspeople you've met, it can make a huge difference, especially in Africa, because usually the individual in Africa carries a lot of people behind them. Practically. I mean, when I was a first-year student in law school, my mom's business had collapsed, so I was supporting her. My sister was struggling to get through undergrad. I was helping her pay her tuition. My cousin ran out of school fees, and she's really smart. I was paying her school fees.A cousin of mine died of AIDS, left an orphan, so we said, well, what are we going to do with her? You know, she's now my baby sister. And because of the opportunities that were afforded to me, I am able to lift all those people. So, don't underestimate that. An example. This man changed my life. He's a professor. He's now at Vanderbilt. He's an undergrad professor, Mitchell Seligson. And because of him, I got into Harvard Law School, because he took an interest. I was taking a class of his, and he was just like, this is an overeager student, which we don't normally get in the United States, because everyone else is cynical and jaded. He called me to his office and said, \"What do you want to do when you grow up?\" I said, \"I want to be a lawyer.\" And he was like, \"Why? You know, we don't need another lawyer in the United States.\" And he tried to talk me out of it, but it was like, \"OK, I know nothing about applying to law school, I'm poli-sci Ph.D. But, you know, let's figure out what I need you to do, what I need to do to help you out.\"It was like, \"Where do you want to go?\" And to me at that time university \u2014 I was at University of Pitts for undergrad, and that was like heaven, OK, because compared to what could have been in Kenya. So I'm like, \"Yeah, I'm just applying to Pitt for law school.\" He was like, \"Why? You know, you're smart, you have all these things going for you.\" And I'm like, \"Because I'm here and it's cheap, and you know, I kind of like Pittsburgh.\" Like, that's the dumbest reason I've ever heard for applying to law school. And, you know, so he took me under his wing, and he encouraged me. And he said, \"Look, you can get into Harvard, you're that good, OK? And if they don't admit you, they're the ones who are messed up.\" And he built me up, you know? And this is just an illustration.You can meet other individuals here. We just need a push. That's all I needed was a push to go to the next level. Basically, I want to end with my vision for Africa, you know? A gentleman spoke yesterday about the indignity of us having to leave the continent so that we can fulfill our potential. You know, my vision is that my daughter, and any other African child being born today, can be whoever they want to be here, without having to leave. And they can have the possibility of transcending the circumstances under which they were born. That's one thing you Americans take for granted, you know? That you can grow up, you know, not so good circumstances, and you can move. Just because you are born in rural Arkansas, whatever, that doesn't define who you are. For most Africans today, where you live, or where you were born, and the circumstances under which you were born, determine the rest of your life. I would like to see that change, and the change starts with us. And as Africans, we need to take responsibility for our continent. Thank you.(Applause)", "id": 330, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:11.958 --> 00:00:14.958\nSo what's image got do with it?\n\n00:00:14.958 --> 00:00:16.958\nAnd I must say, I think Emeka is trying to send\n\n00:00:16.958 --> 00:00:17.958\na lot of subliminal messages,\n\n00:00:17.958 --> 00:00:19.958\nbecause I'm going to keep harping on

just close the loop with some of my personal stories,\n\n00:00:28.958 --> 00:00:30.958\nand try and put a face to a lot of the issues\n\n00:00:30.958 --> 00:00:32.958\nthat we've been talking about.\n\n00:00:32.958 --> 00:00:35.958\nSo, Africa is a complex continent full of contradictions,\n\n00:00:35.958 --> 00:00:36.958\nas you can see.\n\n00:00:36.958 --> 00:00:38.958\nWe're not the

know?\n\n00:00:56.958 --> 00:00:59.958\nAnd this is typically what we've been talking about,\n\n00:00:59.958 --> 00:01:01.958\nthe role that the media plays in focusing\n\n00:01:01.958 --> 00:01:03.958\njust on the negative stuff.\n\n00:01:03.958 --> 00:01:06.958\nNow, why is that a problem?\n\n00:01:06.958 --> 00:01:09.958\nA typical disaster story:\n\n00:01:09.958 --> 00:01:11.958\ndisease, corruption, poverty.\n\n00:01:11.958 --> 00:01:14.958\nAnd some of you might be standing here thinking,\n\n00:01:14.958 --> 00:01:18.958\nsaying, \"OK, you know, Ory, you're

without having money,\n\n00:01:47.958 --> 00:01:51.958\nor being able to support family.\n\n00:01:51.958 --> 00:01:53.958\nEuvin was talking about bellwether signs.\n\n00:01:53.958 --> 00:01:58.958\nThe bellwether for whether our family was broke or not was breakfast.\n\n00:01:58.958 --> 00:02:01.958\nYou know, when things were good, we had eggs and sausages.\n\n00:02:01.958 --> 00:02:04.958\nWhen things were bad, we had porridge.\n\n00:02:04.958 --> 00:02:06.958\nAnd like many African families,\n\n00:02:06.958 --> 00:02:07.958\nmy parents could never save\n\n00:02:07.958 --> 00:02:13.958\nbecause they supported siblings, cousins, you know, their parents,\n\n00:02:13.958 --> 00:02:16.958\nand things were always dicey.\n\n00:02:16.958 --> 00:02:19.958\nNow, when I was born,

you know, what am I going to do?\"\n\n00:03:42.958 --> 00:03:43.958\nAnd my father said, \"OK, listen.\n\n00:03:43.958 --> 00:03:45.958\nLet's go and try and talk to the headmistress.\n\n00:03:45.958 --> 00:03:47.958\nYou know, it's just one point. I mean,\n\n00:03:47.958 --> 00:03:50.958\nmaybe she'll let you in if that slot's still there.\"\n\n00:03:50.958 --> 00:03:53.958\nSo we went to the school,\n\n00:03:53.958 --> 00:03:59.958\nand because we were nobodies, and because we didn't have privilege,\n\n00:03:59.958 --> 00:04:03.958\nand because my father didn't have the right last name,\n\n00:04:03.958 --> 00:04:05.958\nhe was treated like dirt.\n\n00:04:05.958 --> 00:04:09.958\nAnd I sat and listened to the headmistress talk to him, saying,\n\n00:04:09.958 --> 00:04:10.958\nyou know, who do you think you are?\n\n00:04:10.958 --> 00:04:14.958\nAnd, you know, you must be joking if you think\n\n00:04:14.958 --> 00:04:15.958\nyou can get a slot.\n\n00:04:15.958 --> 00:04:20.958\nAnd I had gone to school with other girls, who were kids of politicians,\n\n00:04:20.958 --> 00:04:22.958\nand who had done much, much worse than I did,\n\n00:04:22.958 --> 00:04:25.958\nand they had slots there.\n\n00:04:25.958 --> 00:04:27.958\nAnd there's nothing worse than seeing your parent\n\n00:04:27.958 --> 00:04:30.958\nbeing humiliated in front of you, you know?\n\n00:04:30.958 --> 00:04:32.958\nAnd we left, and I swore to myself,\n\n00:04:32.958 --> 00:04:35.958\nand I was like, \"I'm never, ever going to have\n\n00:04:35.958 --> 00:04:36.958\nto beg for anything in my life.\"\n\n00:04:36.958 --> 00:04:38.958\nThey called me two weeks later, they're like,\n\n00:04:38.958 --> 00:04:43.958\noh, yeah, you can come now. And I told them to stuff it.\n\n00:04:43.958 --> 00:04:45.958\n(Laughter) (Applause)\n\n00:04:45.958 --> 00:04:49.958\nFinal story, and I sort of have to speak quickly.\n\n00:04:49.958 --> 00:04:50.958\nDisease.\n\n00:04:50.958 --> 00:04:57.958\nMy father, who I've been talking about, died of AIDS in 1999.\n\n00:04:57.958 --> 00:04:59.958\nHe never told anyone that he had AIDS,\n\n00:04:59.958 --> 00:05:02.958\nhis fear of the stigma was so strong.\n\n00:05:02.958 --> 00:05:07.958\nAnd I'm pretty much the one who figured it out, because I was a nerd.\n\n00:05:07.958 --> 00:05:09.958\nAnd I was in the States at the time,\n\n00:05:09.958 --> 00:05:12.958\nand they called me. He was very sick, the first time he got sick.\n\n00:05:12.958 --> 00:05:15.958\nAnd he had Cryptococcal meningitis.\n\n00:05:15.958 --> 00:05:18.958\nAnd so I went on to Google, Cryptococcal meningitis, you know.\n\n00:05:18.958 --> 00:05:21.958\nBecause of doctor-patient privilege,\n\n00:05:21.958 --> 00:05:22.958\nthey couldn't really tell us what was going on.\n\n00:05:22.958 --> 00:05:25.958\nBut they were like, you know, this is a long-term thing.\n\n00:05:25.958 --> 00:05:29.958\nAnd when I went online and looked at the infectious --\n\n00:05:29.958 --> 00:05:33.958\nread about the disease,\n\n00:05:33.958 --> 00:05:35.958\nI pretty much realized what was going on.\n\n00:05:35.958 --> 00:05:38.958\nThe first time he got sick, he recovered.\n\n00:05:38.958 --> 00:05:40.958\nBut what happened was that he had to be on medication\n\n00:05:40.958 --> 00:05:43.958\nthat, at that time -- Diflucan, which in the States\n\n00:05:43.958 --> 00:05:47.958\nis used for yeast infections -- cost 30 dollars a pill.\n\n00:05:47.958 --> 00:05:53.958\nHe had to be on that pill for the rest of his life.\n\n00:05:53.958 --> 00:05:55.958\nYou know, so money ran out.\n\n00:05:55.958 --> 00:05:57.958\nHe got sick again.\n\n00:05:57.958 --> 00:06:01.958\nAnd up until that time, he had a friend who used to travel to India,\n\n00:06:01.958 --> 00:06:05.958\nand he used to import, bring him, could\n\n00:06:05.958 --> 00:06:07.958\nget him a generic version of it.\n\n00:06:07.958 --> 00:06:09.958\nAnd that kept him going.\n\n00:06:09.958 --> 00:06:11.958\nBut the money ran out.\n\n00:06:11.958 --> 00:06:14.958\nHe got sick again. He got sick on a Friday.\n\n00:06:14.958 --> 00:06:17.958\nAt that time, there was only one bank that had ATMs in Kenya,\n\n00:06:17.958 --> 00:06:24.958\nand we could not get cash. The family couldn't get cash\n\n00:06:24.958 --> 00:06:27.958\nfor him to start the treatment until Monday.\n\n00:06:27.958 --> 00:06:32.958\nThe hospital put him on a water drip for three days.\n\n00:06:32.958 --> 00:06:35.958\nAnd finally, we figured, well, OK,\n\n00:06:35.958 --> 00:06:37.958\nwe'd better just try and take him to a public hospital.\n\n00:06:37.958 --> 00:06:38.958\nAt least he'll get treated\n\n00:06:38.958 --> 00:06:40.958\nwhile we try to figure out the money situation.\n\n00:06:40.958 --> 00:06:42.958\nAnd he died when the ambulance was coming\n\n00:06:42.958 --> 00:06:45.958\nto the hospital to take him.\n\n00:06:45.958 --> 00:06:50.958\nAnd, you know, now, imagine if -- and I could go on and on --\n\n00:06:50.958 --> 00:06:53.958\nimagine if this is all you know about me.\n\n00:06:53.958 --> 00:06:57.958\nHow would you look at me?\n\n00:06:57.958 --> 00:07:01.958\nWith pity, you know. Sadness.\n\n00:07:01.958 --> 00:07:04.958\nAnd this is how you look at Africa.\n\n00:07:04.958 --> 00:07:06.958\nThis is the damage it causes.\n\n00:07:06.958 --> 00:07:08.958\nYou don't see the other side of me.\n\n00:07:08.958 --> 00:07:09.958\nYou don't see the blogger,\n\n00:07:09.958 --> 00:07:11.958\nyou don't see the Harvard-educated lawyer,\n\n00:07:11.958 --> 00:07:14.958\nthe vibrant person, you know?\n\n00:07:14.958 --> 00:07:16.958\nAnd I just wanted to personalize that.\n\n00:07:16.958 --> 00:07:18.958\nBecause we talk about it in big terms,\n\n00:07:18.958 --> 00:07:21.958\nand you wonder, you know, so what?\n\n00:07:21.958 --> 00:07:24.958\nBut it's damaging.\n\n00:07:24.958 --> 00:07:26.958\nAnd I'm not unique, right?\n\n00:07:26.958 --> 00:07:28.958\nImagine if all you knew about William\n\n00:07:28.958 --> 00:07:31.958\nwas the fact that he grew up in a poor village.\n\n00:07:31.958 --> 00:07:34.958\nAnd you didn't know about the windmill, you know?\n\n00:07:34.958 --> 00:07:36.958\nAnd I was just moved.\n\n00:07:36.958 --> 00:07:39.958\nI was actually crying during his presentation.\n\n00:07:39.958 --> 00:07:41.958\nHe was like, I try and I make.\n\n00:07:41.958 --> 00:07:44.958\nI was like Nike should hire him, you know, \"Just do it!\"\n\n00:07:44.958 --> 00:07:47.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:07:47.958 --> 00:07:48.958\nAnd this is, again, the point I'm trying to make.\n\n00:07:48.958 --> 00:07:50.958\nWhen you focus just on the disasters --\n\n00:07:50.958 --> 00:08:01.958\n(Laughter) (Applause)\n\n00:08:01.958 --> 00:08:04.958\n-- we're ignoring the potential.\n\n00:08:04.958 --> 00:08:08.958\nSo, what is to be done?\n\n00:08:08.958 --> 00:08:09.958\nFirst of all,\n\n00:08:09.958 --> 00:08:12.958\nAfricans, we need to get better at telling our stories.\n\n00:08:12.958 --> 00:08:14.958\nWe heard about that yesterday.\n\n00:08:14.958 --> 00:08:16.958\nWe had some of them this morning.\n\n00:08:16.958 --> 00:08:18.958\nAnd this is an example, you know,\n\n00:08:18.958 --> 00:08:20.958\nblogging is one way of doing that.\n\n00:08:20.958 --> 00:08:23.958\nAfrigator is an aggregator of African blogs\n\n00:08:23.958 --> 00:08:26.958\nthat was developed in South Africa.\n\n00:08:26.958 --> 00:08:27.958\nSo we need to start getting better.\n\n00:08:27.958 --> 00:08:30.958\nIf no one else will tell our stories, let's do it.\n\n00:08:30.958 --> 00:08:31.958\nAnd going back to the point I was trying to make,\n\n00:08:31.958 --> 00:08:35.958\nthis is the Swahili Wikipedia.\n\n00:08:35.958 --> 00:08:39.958\nSwahili is spoken by about 50 million people in East Africa.\n\n00:08:39.958 --> 00:08:42.958\nIt only has five contributors.\n\n00:08:42.958 --> 00:08:46.958\nFour of them are white males -- non-native speakers.\n\n00:08:46.958 --> 00:08:51.958\nThe other person is -- Ndesanjo, if you're here, stand up --\n\n00:08:51.958 --> 00:08:54.958\nis a Tanzanian, [the] first Swahili blogger.\n\n00:08:54.958 --> 00:08:57.958\nHe's the only African who's contributing to this.\n\n00:08:57.958 --> 00:09:01.958\nPeople, please. We can't whine and complain\n\n00:09:01.958 --> 00:09:02.958\nthe West is doing this.\n\n00:09:02.958 --> 00:09:05.958\nWhat are we doing?\n\n00:09:05.958 --> 00:09:07.958\nWhere are the rest of the Swahili speakers?\n\n00:09:07.958 --> 00:09:09.958\nWhy are we not generating our own content?\n\n00:09:09.958 --> 00:09:13.958\nYou know, it's not enough to complain. We need to act.\n\n00:09:13.958 --> 00:09:16.958\nReuters now integrates African blogs\n\n00:09:16.958 --> 00:09:18.958\ninto their coverage of Africa.\n\n00:09:18.958 --> 00:09:19.958\nSo, that's a start,\n\n00:09:19.958 --> 00:09:22.958\nand we've heard of all their other initiatives.\n\n00:09:22.958 --> 00:09:23.958\nThe cheetah generation.\n\n00:09:23.958 --> 00:09:27.958\nThe aid approach, you know, is flawed.\n\n00:09:27.958 --> 00:09:29.958\nAnd after all the hoopla of Live 8,\n\n00:09:29.958 --> 00:09:32.958\nwe're still not anywhere in the picture.\n\n00:09:32.958 --> 00:09:34.958\nNo, you're not.\n\n00:09:34.958 --> 00:09:46.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:09:46.958 --> 00:09:48.958\nBut the point I'm trying to make, though,\n\n00:09:48.958 --> 00:09:52.958\nis that it's not enough for us to criticize.\n\n00:09:52.958 --> 00:09:54.958\nAnd for those of you in the diaspora\n\n00:09:54.958 --> 00:09:56.958\nwho are struggling with where should I be,\n\n00:09:56.958 --> 00:09:57.958\nshould I move back,\n\n00:09:57.958 --> 00:09:58.958\nshould I stay?\n\n00:09:58.958 --> 00:10:00.958\nYou know, just jump.\n\n00:10:00.958 --> 00:10:03.958\nThe continent needs you.\n\n00:10:03.958 --> 00:10:05.958\nAnd I can't emphasize that enough, you know.\n\n00:10:05.958 --> 00:10:10.958\nI walked away from a job with one of the top firms in D.C.,\n\n00:10:10.958 --> 00:10:12.958\nCovington and Burling, six figures.\n\n00:10:12.958 --> 00:10:14.958\nWith two paychecks, or three paychecks,\n\n00:10:14.958 --> 00:10:17.958\nI could solve a lot of my family's problems.\n\n00:10:17.958 --> 00:10:21.958\nBut I walked away from that, because my passion was here,\n\n00:10:21.958 --> 00:10:24.958\nand because I wanted to do things that were fulfilling.\n\n00:10:24.958 --> 00:10:28.958\nAnd because I'm needed here, you know?\n\n00:10:28.958 --> 00:10:31.958\nI probably can win a prize for the most ways\n\n00:10:31.958 --> 00:10:33.958\nto use a Harvard Law School degree\n\n00:10:33.958 --> 00:10:35.958\nbecause of all the things I'm doing.\n\n00:10:35.958 --> 00:10:36.958\nOne is because I'm pretty aggressive,\n\n00:10:36.958 --> 00:10:39.958\nand I try and find, you know, opportunities.\n\n00:10:39.958 --> 00:10:42.958\nBut there is such a need, you know?\n\n00:10:42.958 --> 00:10:43.958\nI'm a corporate lawyer most of the time\n\n00:10:43.958 --> 00:10:45.958\nfor an organization called Enablis\n\n00:10:45.958 --> 00:10:48.958\nthat supports entrepreneurs in South Africa.\n\n00:10:48.958 --> 00:10:51.958\nWe're now moving into East Africa.\n\n00:10:51.958 --> 00:10:54.958\nAnd we give them business development services,\n\n00:10:54.958 --> 00:10:58.958\nas well as financing loan and equity.\n\n00:10:58.958 --> 00:11:00.958\nI've also set up a project in Kenya,\n\n00:11:00.958 --> 00:11:02.958\nand what we do is we track the performance\n\n00:11:02.958 --> 00:11:03.958\nof Kenyan MPs.\n\n00:11:03.958 --> 00:11:07.958\nMy partner, M, who's a tech guru, hacked WordPress.\n\n00:11:07.958 --> 00:11:09.958\nIt costs us, like, 20 dollars a month just for hosting.\n\n00:11:09.958 --> 00:11:13.958\nEverything else on there is a labor of love.\n\n00:11:13.958 --> 00:11:15.958\nWe've manually entered all the data there.\n\n00:11:15.958 --> 00:11:18.958\nAnd you can get profiles of each MP,\n\n00:11:18.958 --> 00:11:20.958\nquestions they've asked in parliament.\n\n00:11:20.958 --> 00:11:22.958\nWe have a comment function,\n\n00:11:22.958 --> 00:11:24.958\nwhere people can ask their MPs questions.\n\n00:11:24.958 --> 00:11:26.958\nThere are some MPs who participate,\n\n00:11:26.958 --> 00:11:27.958\nand come back and ask.\n\n00:11:27.958 --> 00:11:29.958\nAnd basically, we started this because we were tired\n\n00:11:29.958 --> 00:11:32.958\nof complaining about our politicians.\n\n00:11:32.958 --> 00:11:35.958\nYou know, I believe that accountability stems from demand.\n\n00:11:35.958 --> 00:11:37.958\nYou're not just going to be accountable\n\n00:11:37.958 --> 00:11:38.958\nout of the goodness of your heart.\n\n00:11:38.958 --> 00:11:41.958\nAnd we as Africans need to start challenging our leaders.\n\n00:11:41.958 --> 00:11:43.958\nWhat are they doing?\n\n00:11:43.958 --> 00:11:44.958\nYou know, they're not going to change\n\n00:11:44.958 --> 00:11:46.958\njust out of nowhere.\n\n00:11:46.958 --> 00:11:48.958\nSo we need new policies, we need --\n\n00:11:48.958 --> 00:11:50.958\nwhere's that coming from, you know?\n\n00:11:50.958 --> 00:11:52.958\nAnother thing is that these leaders\n\n00:11:52.958 --> 00:11:55.958\nare a reflection of our society.\n\n00:11:55.958 --> 00:11:57.958\nWe talk about African governments\n\n00:11:57.958 --> 00:12:00.958\nlike they've been dropped from Mars, you know?\n\n00:12:00.958 --> 00:12:02.958\nThey come from us.\n\n00:12:02.958 --> 00:12:06.958\nAnd what is it about our society that is generating leaders that we don't like?\n\n00:12:06.958 --> 00:12:08.958\nAnd how can we change that?\n\n00:12:08.958 --> 00:12:12.958\nSo Mzalendo was one small way we thought we could start\n\n00:12:12.958 --> 00:12:16.958\ninspiring people to start holding their leaders accountable.\n\n00:12:16.958 --> 00:12:18.958\nWhere do we go from here?\n\n00:12:18.958 --> 00:12:20.958\nI believe in the power of ideas.\n\n00:12:20.958 --> 00:12:22.958\nI believe in the power of sharing knowledge.\n\n00:12:22.958 --> 00:12:27.958\nAnd I'd ask all of you, when you leave here, please just share,\n\n00:12:27.958 --> 00:12:30.958\nand keep the ideas that you've gotten out of here going,\n\n00:12:30.958 --> 00:12:33.958\nbecause it can make a difference.\n\n00:12:33.958 --> 00:12:35.958\nThe other thing I want to urge you to do\n\n00:12:35.958 --> 00:12:38.958\nis take an interest in the individual.\n\n00:12:38.958 --> 00:12:41.958\nI've had lots of conversations about things I think\n\n00:12:41.958 --> 00:12:43.958\nneed to be happening in Africa.\n\n00:12:43.958 --> 00:12:45.958\nPeople are like, \"OK, if you don't do aid,\n\n00:12:45.958 --> 00:12:48.958\nI'm a bleeding heart liberal, what can I do?\"\n\n00:12:48.958 --> 00:12:49.958\nAnd when I talk about my ideas, they're like,\n\n00:12:49.958 --> 00:12:51.958\n\"BBut it's not scalable, you know.\n\n00:12:51.958 --> 00:12:53.958\nGive me something I can do with Paypal.\"\n\n00:12:53.958 --> 00:12:55.958\nIt's not that easy, you know?\n\n00:12:55.958 --> 00:12:59.958\nAnd sometimes just taking an interest in the individual,\n\n00:12:59.958 --> 00:13:02.958\nin the fellows you've met, and the businesspeople you've met,\n\n00:13:02.958 --> 00:13:04.958\nit can make a huge difference, especially in Africa,\n\n00:13:04.958 --> 00:13:06.958\nbecause usually the individual in Africa\n\n00:13:06.958 --> 00:13:08.958\ncarries a lot of people behind them.\n\n00:13:08.958 --> 00:13:13.958\nPractically. I mean, when I was a first-year student in law school,\n\n00:13:13.958 --> 00:13:17.958\nmy mom's business had collapsed, so I was supporting her.\n\n00:13:17.958 --> 00:13:19.958\nMy sister was struggling to get through undergrad.\n\n00:13:19.958 --> 00:13:21.958\nI was helping her pay her tuition.\n\n00:13:21.958 --> 00:13:24.958\nMy cousin ran out of school fees, and she's really smart.\n\n00:13:24.958 --> 00:13:25.958\nI was paying her school fees.\n\n00:13:25.958 --> 00:13:28.958\nA cousin of mine died of AIDS, left an orphan,\n\n00:13:28.958 --> 00:13:30.958\nso we said, well, what are we going to do with her?\n\n00:13:30.958 --> 00:13:32.958\nYou know, she's now my baby sister.\n\n00:13:32.958 --> 00:13:34.958\nAnd because of the opportunities that were afforded to me,\n\n00:13:34.958 --> 00:13:36.958\nI am able to lift all those people.\n\n00:13:36.958 --> 00:13:40.958\nSo, don't underestimate that.\n\n00:13:40.958 --> 00:13:42.958\nAn example. This man changed my life.\n\n00:13:42.958 --> 00:13:44.958\nHe's a professor. He's now at Vanderbilt.\n\n00:13:44.958 --> 00:13:47.958\nHe's an undergrad professor, Mitchell Seligson.\n\n00:13:47.958 --> 00:13:49.958\nAnd because of him, I got into Harvard Law School,\n\n00:13:49.958 --> 00:13:50.958\nbecause he took an interest.\n\n00:13:50.958 --> 00:13:54.958\nI was taking a class of his, and he was just like,\n\n00:13:54.958 --> 00:13:56.958\nthis is an overeager student,\n\n00:13:56.958 --> 00:13:58.958\nwhich we don't normally get in the United States,\n\n00:13:58.958 --> 00:14:02.958\nbecause everyone else is cynical and jaded.\n\n00:14:02.958 --> 00:14:03.958\nHe called me to his office and said,\n\n00:14:03.958 --> 00:14:04.958\n\"What do you want to do when you grow up?\"\n\n00:14:04.958 --> 00:14:05.958\nI said, \"I want to be a lawyer.\"\n\n00:14:05.958 --> 00:14:08.958\nAnd he was like, \"Why? You know,\n\n00:14:08.958 --> 00:14:10.958\nwe don't need another lawyer in the United States.\"\n\n00:14:10.958 --> 00:14:12.958\nAnd he tried to talk me out of it,\n\n00:14:12.958 --> 00:14:15.958\nbut it was like, \"OK, I know nothing about applying to law school,\n\n00:14:15.958 --> 00:14:16.958\nI'm poli-sci Ph.D.\n\n00:14:16.958 --> 00:14:20.958\nBut, you know, let's figure out what I need you to do,\n\n00:14:20.958 --> 00:14:21.958\nwhat I need to do to help you out.\"\n\n00:14:21.958 --> 00:14:23.958\nIt was like, \"Where do you want to go?\"\n\n00:14:23.958 --> 00:14:24.958\nAnd to me at that time university --\n\n00:14:24.958 --> 00:14:26.958\nI was at University of Pitts for undergrad,\n\n00:14:26.958 --> 00:14:28.958\nand that was like heaven, OK,\n\n00:14:28.958 --> 00:14:30.958\nbecause compared to what could have been in Kenya.\n\n00:14:30.958 --> 00:14:33.958\nSo I'm like, \"Yeah, I'm just applying to Pitt for law school.\"\n\n00:14:33.958 --> 00:14:35.958\nHe was like, \"Why? You know, you're smart,\n\n00:14:35.958 --> 00:14:37.958\nyou have all these things going for you.\"\n\n00:14:37.958 --> 00:14:39.958\nAnd I'm like, \"Because I'm here and it's cheap,\n\n00:14:39.958 --> 00:14:42.958\nand you know, I kind of like Pittsburgh.\"\n\n00:14:42.958 --> 00:14:44.958\nLike, that's the dumbest reason I've ever heard\n\n00:14:44.958 --> 00:14:46.958\nfor applying to law school.\n\n00:14:46.958 --> 00:14:50.958\nAnd, you know, so he took me under his wing, and he encouraged me.\n\n00:14:50.958 --> 00:14:52.958\nAnd he said, \"Look, you can get into Harvard,\n\n00:14:52.958 --> 00:14:53.958\nyou're that good, OK?\n\n00:14:53.958 --> 00:14:58.958\nAnd if they don't admit you, they're the ones who are messed up.\"\n\n00:14:58.958 --> 00:15:00.958\nAnd he built me up, you know?\n\n00:15:00.958 --> 00:15:02.958\nAnd this is just an illustration.\n\n00:15:02.958 --> 00:15:04.958\nYou can meet other individuals here.\n\n00:15:04.958 --> 00:15:05.958\nWe just need a push.\n\n00:15:05.958 --> 00:15:11.958\nThat's all I needed was a push to go to the next level.\n\n00:15:11.958 --> 00:15:18.958\nBasically, I want to end with my vision for Africa, you know?\n\n00:15:18.958 --> 00:15:20.958\nA gentleman spoke yesterday about the indignity\n\n00:15:20.958 --> 00:15:25.958\nof us having to leave the continent\n\n00:15:25.958 --> 00:15:28.958\nso that we can fulfill our potential.\n\n00:15:28.958 --> 00:15:30.958\nYou know, my vision is that my daughter,\n\n00:15:30.958 --> 00:15:34.958\nand any other African child being born today,\n\n00:15:34.958 --> 00:15:38.958\ncan be whoever they want to be here,\n\n00:15:38.958 --> 00:15:40.958\nwithout having to leave.\n\n00:15:40.958 --> 00:15:44.958\nAnd they can have the possibility of transcending\n\n00:15:44.958 --> 00:15:47.958\nthe circumstances under which they were born.\n\n00:15:47.958 --> 00:15:50.958\nThat's one thing you Americans take for granted, you know?\n\n00:15:50.958 --> 00:15:54.958\nThat you can grow up, you know, not so good circumstances,\n\n00:15:54.958 --> 00:15:57.958\nand you can move.\n\n00:15:57.958 --> 00:16:01.958\nJust because you are born in rural Arkansas, whatever,\n\n00:16:01.958 --> 00:16:02.958\nthat doesn't define who you are.\n\n00:16:02.958 --> 00:16:08.958\nFor most Africans today, where you live, or where you were born,\n\n00:16:08.958 --> 00:16:11.958\nand the circumstances under which you were born,\n\n00:16:11.958 --> 00:16:13.958\ndetermine the rest of your life.\n\n00:16:13.958 --> 00:16:15.958\nI would like to see that change,\n\n00:16:15.958 --> 00:16:17.958\nand the change starts with us.\n\n00:16:17.958 --> 00:16:21.958\nAnd as Africans, we need to take responsibility for our continent.\n\n00:16:21.958 --> 00:16:22.958\nThank you.\n\n00:16:22.958 --> 00:16:26.958\n(Applause)"}, {"title": "A talking, squawking parrot", "duration": "348", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/einstein_the_parrot_talks_and_squawks", "transcript": "Stephanie White: I'm going to let her introduce herself to everybody. Can you tell everybody your name?Einstein: Einstein.SW: This is Einstein. Can you tell everyone \"hi\"?E: Hello.SW: That's nice. Can you be polite?E: Hi, sweetheart.SW: Much better. Well, Einstein is very honored to be here at TED 2006, amongst all you modern-day Einsteins. In fact, she's very excited.E: Woo.SW: Yeah. (Laughter) Since we've arrived, there's been a constant buzz about all the exciting speakers here for the conference. This morning we've heard a lot of whispers about Tom Reilly's wrap-up on Saturday. Einstein, did you hear whispers?E: [Squawks]SW: Yeah. (Laughter) Einstein's especially interested in Penelope's talk. A lot of her research goes on in caves, which can get pretty dusty.E: Achoo!SW: It could make her sneeze. But more importantly, her research could help Einstein find a cure for her never-ending scratchy throat.Einstein: [Coughs]SW: Yeah. (Laughter) Well, Bob Russell was telling us about his work on nanotubes in his research at the microscopic level. Well, that's really cool, but what Einstein's really hoping is that maybe he'll genetically engineer a five-pound peanut.E: Oh, my God! My God! My God!SW: Yeah. She would get really, really excited. (Laughter) That is one big peanut. Since Einstein is a bird, she's very interested in things that fly. She thinks Burt Rutan is very impressive.E: Ooh.SW: Yeah. She especially likes his latest achievement, SpaceShipOne.Einstein, would you like to ride in Burt's spaceship? E: [Spaceship noise] SW: Even if it doesn't have a laser?E: [Laser noise] (Laughter)SW: Yeah, yeah. That was pretty funny, Einstein. Now, Einstein also thinks, you know, working in caves and travelling through space \u2014 it's all very dangerous jobs. It would be very dangerous if you fell down.E: Wheeeeeee! [Splat]SW: Yeah. (Laughter) Little splat at the end there. Einstein, did that hurt?E: Ow, ow, ow.SW: Yeah. It's all a lot of hard work.E: [Squawks]SW: Yeah. It can get a bird like Einstein frustrated.E: [Squawks]SW: Yeah, it sure can. But when Einstein needs to relax from her job educating the public, she loves to take in the arts. If the children of the Uganda need another dance partner, Einstein could sure fit the bill, because she loves to dance. Can you get down? E: [Bobbing head] (Laughter) SW: Let's get down for everybody. Come on now. She's going to make me do it, too. Ooh, ooh.Einstein: Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh.SW: Do your head now.E: Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh. (Laughter)SW: Or maybe Sirena Huang would like to learn some arias on her violin, and Einstein can sing along with some opera?E: [Operatic squawk]SW: Very good. (Laughter) Or maybe Stu just needs another backup singer? Einstein, can you also sing? I know, you need to get rid of that seed first. Can you sing?E: La, la.SW: There you go. And, of course, if all else fails, you can just run off and enjoy a fun fiesta.E: [Squawks]SW: All right. Well, Einstein was pretty embarrassed to admit this earlier, but she was telling me backstage that she had a problem.E: What's the matter?SW: No, I don't have a problem. You have the problem, remember? You were saying that you were really embarrassed, because you're in love with a pirate?E: Yar.SW: There you go. And what do pirates like to drink?E: Beer. SW: Yeah, that's right. But you don't like to drink beer, Einstein. You like to drink water.E: [Water sound]SW: Very good. Now, really, she is pretty nervous. Because one of her favorite folks from back home is here, and she's pretty nervous to meet him. She thinks Al Gore is a really good-looking man. What do you say to a good-looking man?E: Hey, baby. (Laughter)SW: And so do all the folks back home in Tennessee.E: Yee haw. (Laughter)SW: And since she's such a big fan, she knows that his birthday is coming up at the end of March. And we didn't think he'd be in town then, so Einstein wanted to do something special for him. So let's see if Einstein will sing \"Happy Birthday\" to Al Gore. Can you sing \"Happy Birthday\" to him?E: Happy birthday to you.SW: Again.E: Happy birthday to you.SW: Again.E: Happy birthday to you.SW: Big finish.E: Happy birthday to you.SW: Good job! (Applause) Well, before we wrap it up, she would like to give a shout out to all our animal friends back at the Knoxville Zoo. Einstein, do you want to say \"hi\" to all the owls?E: Woo, woo, woo.SW: What about the other birds?E: Tweet, tweet, tweet.SW: And the penguin?E: Quack, quack, quack. SW: There we go. (Laughter) Let's get that one out of there. How about a chimpanzee?E: Ooh, ooh, ooh. Aah, aah, aah.SW: Very good. (Laughter) What about a wolf?E: Ooooowww.SW: And a pig?E: Oink, oink, oink.SW: And the rooster?E: Cock-a-doodle-doo!SW: And how about those cats?E: Meow. (Laughter)SW: At the zoo we have big cats from the jungle.E: Grrrrr. (Laughter)SW: What about a skunk?E: Stinker. (Laughter)SW: She's a comedian. I suppose you think you're famous? Are you famous?E: Superstar.SW: Yeah. You are a superstar. (Laughter) Well, we would like to encourage all of you to do your part to help protect Einstein's animal friends, and to do your part to help protect their homes that they live [in]. Now, Einstein does say it best when we ask her. Why do we want to protect your home?E: I'm special.SW: You are very special. What would you like to say to all these nice people?E: I love you.SW: That's good. Can you blow them a kiss?E: [Kissing noise]SW: And what do you say when it's time to go?E: Goodbye.SW: Good job.

They ask if it should have reproduction in it, or metabolism, or evolution. And I don't know the answer to that, so I'm not going to tell you. I will say that life involves computation. So this is a computer program. Booted up in a cell, the program would execute, and it could result in this person; or with a small change, it could result in this person; or another small change, this person; or with a larger change, this dog, or this tree, or this whale.So now, if you take this metaphor [of] genome as program seriously, you have to consider that Chris Anderson is a computer-fabricated artifact, as is Jim Watson, Craig Venter, as are all of us. And in convincing yourself that this metaphor is true, there are lots of similarities between genetic programs and computer programs that could help to convince you. But one, to me, that's most compelling is the peculiar sensitivity to small changes that can make large changes in biological development \u2014 the output. A small mutation can take a two-wing fly and make it a four-wing fly. Or it could take a fly and put legs where its antennae should be. Or if you're familiar with \"The Princess Bride,\" it could create a six-fingered man.Now, a hallmark of computer programs is just this kind of sensitivity to small changes. If your bank account's one dollar, and you flip a single bit, you could end up with a thousand dollars. So these small changes are things that I think that \u2014 they indicate to us that a complicated computation in development is underlying these amplified, large changes.So now, all of this indicates that there are molecular programs underlying biology, and it shows the power of molecular programs \u2014 biology does. And what I want to do is write molecular programs, potentially to build technology. And there are a lot of people doing this, a lot of synthetic biologists doing this, like Craig Venter. And they concentrate on using cells. They're cell-oriented. So my friends, molecular programmers, and I have a sort of biomolecule-centric approach. We're interested in using DNA, RNA and protein, and building new languages for building things from the bottom up, using biomolecules, potentially having nothing to do with biology. So, these are all the machines in a cell. There's a camera. There's the solar panels of the cell, some switches that turn your genes on and off, the girders of the cell, motors that move your muscles. My little group of molecular programmers are trying to refashion all of these parts from DNA. We're not DNA zealots, but DNA is the cheapest, easiest to understand and easy to program material to do this. And as other things become easier to use \u2014 maybe protein \u2014 we'll work with those.If we succeed, what will molecular programming look like? You're going to sit in front of your computer. You're going to design something like a cell phone, and in a high-level language, you'll describe that cell phone. Then you're going to have a compiler that's going to take that description and it's going to turn it into actual molecules that can be sent to a synthesizer and that synthesizer will pack those molecules into a seed. And what happens if you water and feed that seed appropriately, is it will do a developmental computation, a molecular computation, and it'll build an electronic computer. And if I haven't revealed my prejudices already, I think that life has been about molecular computers building electrochemical computers, building electronic computers, which together with electrochemical computers will build new molecular computers, which will build new electronic computers, and so forth.And if you buy all of this, and you think life is about computation, as I do, then you look at big questions through the eyes of a computer scientist. So one big question is, how does a baby know when to stop growing? And for molecular programming, the question is how does your cell phone know when to stop growing? (Laughter) Or how does a computer program know when to stop running? Or more to the point, how do you know if a program will ever stop? There are other questions like this, too. One of them is Craig Venter's question. Turns out I think he's actually a computer scientist. He asked, how big is the minimal genome that will give me a functioning microorganism? How few genes can I use? This is exactly analogous to the question, what's the smallest program I can write that will act exactly like Microsoft Word? (Laughter) And just as he's writing, you know, bacteria that will be smaller, he's writing genomes that will work, we could write smaller programs that would do what Microsoft Word does.But for molecular programming, our question is, how many molecules do we need to put in that seed to get a cell phone? What's the smallest number we can get away with? Now, these are big questions in computer science. These are all complexity questions, and computer science tells us that these are very hard questions. Almost \u2014 many of them are impossible. But for some tasks, we can start to answer them. So, I'm going to start asking those questions for the DNA structures I'm going to talk about next. So, this is normal DNA, what you think of as normal DNA. It's double-stranded, it's a double helix, has the As, Ts, Cs and Gs that pair to hold the strands together. And I'm going to draw it like this sometimes, just so I don't scare you. We want to look at individual strands and not think about the double helix. When we synthesize it, it comes single-stranded, so we can take the blue strand in one tube and make an orange strand in the other tube, and they're floppy when they're single-stranded. You mix them together and they make a rigid double helix. Now for the last 25 years, Ned Seeman and a bunch of his descendants have worked very hard and made beautiful three-dimensional structures using this kind of reaction of DNA strands coming together. But a lot of their approaches, though elegant, take a long time. They can take a couple of years, or it can be difficult to design.So I came up with a new method a couple of years ago I call DNA origami that's so easy you could do it at home in your kitchen and design the stuff on a laptop. But to do it, you need a long, single strand of DNA, which is technically very difficult to get. So, you can go to a natural source. You can look in this computer-fabricated artifact, and he's got a double-stranded genome \u2014 that's no good. You look in his intestines. There are billions of bacteria. They're no good either. Double strand again, but inside them, they're infected with a virus that has a nice, long, single-stranded genome that we can fold like a piece of paper. And here's how we do it.This is part of that genome. We add a bunch of short, synthetic DNAs that I call staples. Each one has a left half that binds the long strand in one place, and a right half that binds it in a different place, and brings the long strand together like this. The net action of many of these on that long strand is to fold it into something like a rectangle.Now, we can't actually take a movie of this process, but Shawn Douglas at Harvard has made a nice visualization for us that begins with a long strand and has some short strands in it. And what happens is that we mix these strands together. We heat them up, we add a little bit of salt, we heat them up to almost boiling and cool them down, and as we cool them down, the short strands bind the long strands and start to form structure. And you can see a little bit of double helix forming there. When you look at DNA origami, you can see that what it really is, even though you think it's complicated, is a bunch of double helices that are parallel to each other, and they're held together by places where short strands go along one helix and then jump to another one. So there's a strand that goes like this, goes along one helix and binds \u2014 it jumps to another helix and comes back. That holds the long strand like this.Now, to show that we could make any shape or pattern that we wanted, I tried to make this shape. I wanted to fold DNA into something that goes up over the eye, down the nose, up the nose, around the forehead, back down and end in a little loop like this. And so, I thought, if this could work, anything could work. So I had the computer program design the short staples to do this. I ordered them; they came by FedEx. I mixed them up, heated them, cooled them down, and I got 50 billion little smiley faces floating around in a single drop of water. And each one of these is just one-thousandth the width of a human hair, OK?So, they're all floating around in solution, and to look at them, you have to get them on a surface where they stick. So, you pour them out onto a surface and they start to stick to that surface, and we take a picture using an atomic-force microscope. It's got a needle, like a record needle, that goes back and forth over the surface, bumps up and down, and feels the height of the first surface. It feels the DNA origami. There's the atomic-force microscope working and you can see that the landing's a little rough. When you zoom in, they've got, you know, weak jaws that flip over their heads and some of their noses get punched out, but it's pretty good. You can zoom in and even see the extra little loop, this little nano-goatee.Now, what's great about this is anybody can do this. And so, I got this in the mail about a year after I did this, unsolicited. Anyone know what this is? What is it? It's China, right? So, what happened is, a graduate student in China, Lulu Qian, did a great job. She wrote all her own software to design and built this DNA origami, a beautiful rendition of China, which even has Taiwan, and you can see it's sort of on the world's shortest leash, right? (Laughter) So, this works really well and you can make patterns as well as shapes, OK? And you can make a map of the Americas and spell DNA with DNA.And what's really neat about it \u2014 well, actually, this all looks like nano-artwork, but it turns out that nano-artwork is just what you need to make nano-circuits. So, you can put circuit components on the staples, like a light bulb and a light switch. Let the thing assemble, and you'll get some kind of a circuit. And then you can maybe wash the DNA away and have the circuit left over. So, this is what some colleagues of mine at Caltech did. They took a DNA origami, organized some carbon nano-tubes, made a little switch, you see here, wired it up, tested it and showed that it is indeed a switch. Now, this is just a single switch and you need half a billion for a computer, so we have a long way to go. But this is very promising because the origami can organize parts just one-tenth the size of those in a normal computer. So it's very promising for making small computers.Now, I want to get back to that compiler. The DNA origami is a proof that that compiler actually works. So, you start with something in the computer. You get a high-level description of the computer program, a high-level description of the origami. You can compile it to molecules, send it to a synthesizer, and it actually works. And it turns out that a company has made a nice program that's much better than my code, which was kind of ugly, and will allow us to do this in a nice, visual, computer-aided design way.So, now you can say, all right, why isn't DNA origami the end of the story? You have your molecular compiler, you can do whatever you want. The fact is that it does not scale. So if you want to build a human from DNA origami, the problem is, you need a long strand that's 10 trillion trillion bases long. That's three light years' worth of DNA, so we're not going to do this. We're going to turn to another technology, called algorithmic self-assembly of tiles. It was started by Erik Winfree, and what it does, it has tiles that are a hundredth the size of a DNA origami. You zoom in, there are just four DNA strands and they have little single-stranded bits on them that can bind to other tiles, if they match. And we like to draw these tiles as little squares. And if you look at their sticky ends, these little DNA bits, you can see that they actually form a checkerboard pattern. So, these tiles would make a complicated, self-assembling checkerboard. And the point of this, if you didn't catch that, is that tiles are a kind of molecular program and they can output patterns. And a really amazing part of this is that any computer program can be translated into one of these tile programs \u2014 specifically, counting. So, you can come up with a set of tiles that when they come together, form a little binary counter rather than a checkerboard. So you can read off binary numbers five, six and seven.And in order to get these kinds of computations started right, you need some kind of input, a kind of seed. You can use DNA origami for that. You can encode the number 32 in the right-hand side of a DNA origami, and when you add those tiles that count, they will start to count \u2014 they will read that 32 and they'll stop at 32. So, what we've done is we've figured out a way to have a molecular program know when to stop going. It knows when to stop growing because it can count. It knows how big it is. So, that answers that sort of first question I was talking about. It doesn't tell us how babies do it, however.So now, we can use this counting to try and get at much bigger things than DNA origami could otherwise. Here's the DNA origami, and what we can do is we can write 32 on both edges of the DNA origami, and we can now use our watering can and water with tiles, and we can start growing tiles off of that and create a square. The counter serves as a template to fill in a square in the middle of this thing. So, what we've done is we've succeeded in making something much bigger than a DNA origami by combining DNA origami with tiles. And the neat thing about it is, is that it's also reprogrammable. You can just change a couple of the DNA strands in this binary representation and you'll get 96 rather than 32. And if you do that, the origami's the same size, but the resulting square that you get is three times bigger.So, this sort of recapitulates what I was telling you about development. You have a very sensitive computer program where small changes \u2014 single, tiny, little mutations \u2014 can take something that made one size square and make something very much bigger. Now, this \u2014 using counting to compute and build these kinds of things by this kind of developmental process is something that also has bearing on Craig Venter's question. So, you can ask, how many DNA strands are required to build a square of a given size? If we wanted to make a square of size 10, 100 or 1,000, if we used DNA origami alone, we would require a number of DNA strands that's the square of the size of that square; so we'd need 100, 10,000 or a million DNA strands. That's really not affordable. But if we use a little computation \u2014 we use origami, plus some tiles that count \u2014 then we can get away with using 100, 200 or 300 DNA strands. And so we can exponentially reduce the number of DNA strands we use, if we use counting, if we use a little bit of computation. And so computation is some very powerful way to reduce the number of molecules you need to build something, to reduce the size of the genome that you're building.And finally, I'm going to get back to that sort of crazy idea about computers building computers. If you look at the square that you build with the origami and some counters growing off it, the pattern that it has is exactly the pattern that you need to make a memory. So if you affix some wires and switches to those tiles \u2014 rather than to the staple strands, you affix them to the tiles \u2014 then they'll self-assemble the somewhat complicated circuits, the demultiplexer circuits, that you need to address this memory. So you can actually make a complicated circuit using a little bit of computation. It's a molecular computer building an electronic computer. Now, you ask me, how far have we gotten down this path? Experimentally, this is what we've done in the last year. Here is a DNA origami rectangle, and here are some tiles growing from it. And you can see how they count. One, two, three, four, five, six, nine, 10, 11, 12, 17. So it's got some errors, but at least it counts up. (Laughter)So, it turns out we actually had this idea nine years ago, and that's about the time constant for how long it takes to do these kinds of things, so I think we made a lot of progress. We've got ideas about how to fix these errors. And I think in the next five or 10 years, we'll make the kind of squares that I described and maybe even get to some of those self-assembled circuits.So now, what do I want you to take away from this talk? I want you to remember that to create life's very diverse and complex forms, life uses computation to do that. And the computations that it uses, they're molecular computations, and in order to understand this and get a better handle on it, as Feynman said, you know, we need to build something to understand it. And so we are going to use molecules and refashion this thing, rebuild everything from the bottom up, using DNA in ways that nature never intended, using DNA origami, and DNA origami to seed this algorithmic self-assembly.You know, so this is all very cool, but what I'd like you to take from the talk, hopefully from some of those big questions, is that this molecular programming isn't just about making gadgets. It's not just making about \u2014 it's making self-assembled cell phones and circuits. What it's really about is taking computer science and looking at big questions in a new light, asking new versions of those big questions and trying to understand how biology can make such amazing things. Thank you.

life.\n\n00:00:14.958 --> 00:00:19.958\nThey ask if it should have reproduction in it, or metabolism, or evolution.\n\n00:00:19.958 --> 00:00:21.958\nAnd I don't know the answer to that, so I'm not going to tell you.\n\n00:00:21.958 --> 00:00:24.958\nI will say that life involves computation.\n\n00:00:24.958 --> 00:00:26.958\nSo this is a computer program.\n\n00:00:26.958 --> 00:00:29.958\nBooted up in a cell, the program would execute,\n\n00:00:29.958 --> 00:00:32.958\nand it could result in this person;\n\n00:00:32.958 --> 00:00:35.958\nor with a small change, it could result in this person;\n\n00:00:35.958 --> 00:00:37.958\nor another small change, this person;\n\n00:00:37.958 --> 00:00:40.958\nor with a larger change, this dog,\n\n00:00:40.958 --> 00:00:42.958\nor this tree, or this whale.\n\n00:00:42.958 --> 00:00:44.958\nSo now, if you take this metaphor\n\n00:00:44.958 --> 00:00:46.958\n[of] genome as program seriously,\n\n00:00:46.958 --> 00:00:48.958\nyou have to consider that Chris Anderson\n\n00:00:48.958 --> 00:00:51.958\nis a computer-fabricated artifact, as is Jim Watson,\n\n00:00:51.958 --> 00:00:54.958\nCraig Venter, as are all of us.\n\n00:00:54.958 --> 00:00:56.958\nAnd in convincing yourself that this metaphor is true,\n\n00:00:56.958 --> 00:00:58.958\nthere are lots of similarities between genetic programs\n\n00:00:58.958 --> 00:01:01.958\nand computer programs that could help to convince you.\n\n00:01:01.958 --> 00:01:03.958\nBut one, to me, that's most compelling\n\n00:01:03.958 --> 00:01:06.958\nis the peculiar sensitivity to small changes\n\n00:01:06.958 --> 00:01:09.958\nthat can make large changes in biological development -- the output.\n\n00:01:09.958 --> 00:01:11.958\nA small mutation can take a two-wing fly\n\n00:01:11.958 --> 00:01:12.958\nand make it a four-wing fly.\n\n00:01:12.958 --> 00:01:16.958\nOr it could take a fly and put legs where its antennae should be.\n\n00:01:16.958 --> 00:01:18.958\nOr if you're familiar with \"The Princess Bride,\"\n\n00:01:18.958 --> 00:01:20.958\nit could create a six-fingered man.\n\n00:01:20.958 --> 00:01:22.958\nNow, a hallmark of computer programs\n\n00:01:22.958 --> 00:01:25.958\nis just this kind of sensitivity to small changes.\n\n00:01:25.958 --> 00:01:27.958\nIf your bank account's one dollar, and you flip a single bit,\n\n00:01:27.958 --> 00:01:29.958\nyou could end up with a thousand dollars.\n\n00:01:29.958 --> 00:01:32.958\nSo these small changes are things that I think\n\n00:01:32.958 --> 00:01:34.958\nthat -- they indicate to us that a complicated computation\n\n00:01:34.958 --> 00:01:38.958\nin development is underlying these amplified, large changes.\n\n00:01:38.958 --> 00:01:44.958\nSo now, all of this indicates that there are molecular programs underlying biology,\n\n00:01:44.958 --> 00:01:48.958\nand it shows the power of molecular programs -- biology does.\n\n00:01:48.958 --> 00:01:50.958\nAnd what I want to do is write molecular programs,\n\n00:01:50.958 --> 00:01:52.958\npotentially to build technology.\n\n00:01:52.958 --> 00:01:53.958\nAnd there are a lot of people doing this,\n\n00:01:53.958 --> 00:01:56.958\na lot of synthetic biologists doing this, like Craig Venter.\n\n00:01:56.958 --> 00:01:58.958\nAnd they concentrate on using cells.\n\n00:01:58.958 --> 00:02:00.958\nThey're cell-oriented.\n\n00:02:00.958 --> 00:02:02.958\nSo my friends, molecular programmers, and I\n\n00:02:02.958 --> 00:02:04.958\nhave a sort of biomolecule-centric approach.\n\n00:02:04.958 --> 00:02:07.958\nWe're interested in using DNA, RNA and protein,\n\n00:02:07.958 --> 00:02:10.958\nand building new languages for building things from the bottom up,\n\n00:02:10.958 --> 00:02:11.958\nusing biomolecules,\n\n00:02:11.958 --> 00:02:14.958\npotentially having nothing to do with biology.\n\n00:02:14.958 --> 00:02:18.958\nSo, these are all the machines in a cell.\n\n00:02:18.958 --> 00:02:20.958\nThere's a camera.\n\n00:02:20.958 --> 00:02:21.958\nThere's the solar panels of the cell,\n\n00:02:21.958 --> 00:02:23.958\nsome switches that turn your genes on and off,\n\n00:02:23.958 --> 00:02:26.958\nthe girders of the cell, motors that move your muscles.\n\n00:02:26.958 --> 00:02:28.958\nMy little group of molecular programmers\n\n00:02:28.958 --> 00:02:32.958\nare trying to refashion all of these parts from DNA.\n\n00:02:32.958 --> 00:02:34.958\nWe're not DNA zealots, but DNA is the cheapest,\n\n00:02:34.958 --> 00:02:37.958\neasiest to understand and easy to program material to do this.\n\n00:02:37.958 --> 00:02:39.958\nAnd as other things become easier to use --\n\n00:02:39.958 --> 00:02:42.958\nmaybe protein -- we'll work with those.\n\n00:02:42.958 --> 00:02:44.958\nIf we succeed, what will molecular programming look like?\n\n00:02:44.958 --> 00:02:46.958\nYou're going to sit in front of your computer.\n\n00:02:46.958 --> 00:02:48.958\nYou're going to design something like a cell phone,\n\n00:02:48.958 --> 00:02:50.958\nand in a high-level language, you'll describe that cell phone.\n\n00:02:50.958 --> 00:02:52.958\nThen you're going to have a compiler\n\n00:02:52.958 --> 00:02:53.958\nthat's going to take that description\n\n00:02:53.958 --> 00:02:55.958\nand it's going to turn it into actual molecules\n\n00:02:55.958 --> 00:02:57.958\nthat can be sent to a synthesizer\n\n00:02:57.958 --> 00:03:00.958\nand that synthesizer will pack those molecules into a seed.\n\n00:03:00.958 --> 00:03:03.958\nAnd what happens if you water and feed that seed appropriately,\n\n00:03:03.958 --> 00:03:05.958\nis it will do a developmental computation,\n\n00:03:05.958 --> 00:03:08.958\na molecular computation, and it'll build an electronic computer.\n\n00:03:08.958 --> 00:03:10.958\nAnd if I haven't revealed my prejudices already,\n\n00:03:11.958 --> 00:03:13.958\nI think that life has been about molecular computers\n\n00:03:13.958 --> 00:03:15.958\nbuilding electrochemical computers,\n\n00:03:15.958 --> 00:03:17.958\nbuilding electronic computers,\n\n00:03:17.958 --> 00:03:19.958\nwhich together with electrochemical computers\n\n00:03:19.958 --> 00:03:21.958\nwill build new molecular computers,\n\n00:03:21.958 --> 00:03:24.958\nwhich will build new electronic computers, and so forth.\n\n00:03:24.958 --> 00:03:25.958\nAnd if you buy all of this,\n\n00:03:25.958 --> 00:03:27.958\nand you think life is about computation, as I do,\n\n00:03:27.958 --> 00:03:30.958\nthen you look at big questions through the eyes of a computer scientist.\n\n00:03:30.958 --> 00:03:34.958\nSo one big question is, how does a baby know when to stop growing?\n\n00:03:34.958 --> 00:03:36.958\nAnd for molecular programming,\n\n00:03:36.958 --> 00:03:38.958\nthe question is how does your cell phone know when to stop growing?\n\n00:03:38.958 --> 00:03:39.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:03:39.958 --> 00:03:42.958\nOr how does a computer program know when to stop running?\n\n00:03:42.958 --> 00:03:45.958\nOr more to the point, how do you know if a program will ever stop?\n\n00:03:45.958 --> 00:03:47.958\nThere are other questions like this, too.\n\n00:03:47.958 --> 00:03:49.958\nOne of them is Craig Venter's question.\n\n00:03:49.958 --> 00:03:51.958\nTurns out I think he's actually a computer scientist.\n\n00:03:51.958 --> 00:03:54.958\nHe asked, how big is the minimal genome\n\n00:03:54.958 --> 00:03:56.958\nthat will give me a functioning microorganism?\n\n00:03:56.958 --> 00:03:58.958\nHow few genes can I use?\n\n00:03:58.958 --> 00:04:00.958\nThis is exactly analogous to the question,\n\n00:04:00.958 --> 00:04:01.958\nwhat's the smallest program I can write\n\n00:04:01.958 --> 00:04:03.958\nthat will act exactly like Microsoft Word?\n\n00:04:03.958 --> 00:04:04.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:04:04.958 --> 00:04:08.958\nAnd just as he's writing, you know, bacteria that will be smaller,\n\n00:04:08.958 --> 00:04:09.958\nhe's writing genomes that will work,\n\n00:04:09.958 --> 00:04:11.958\nwe could write smaller programs\n\n00:04:11.958 --> 00:04:13.958\nthat would do what Microsoft Word does.\n\n00:04:13.958 --> 00:04:15.958\nBut for molecular programming, our question is,\n\n00:04:15.958 --> 00:04:19.958\nhow many molecules do we need to put in that seed to get a cell phone?\n\n00:04:19.958 --> 00:04:21.958\nWhat's the smallest number we can get away with?\n\n00:04:21.958 --> 00:04:23.958\nNow, these are big questions in computer science.\n\n00:04:23.958 --> 00:04:25.958\nThese are all complexity questions,\n\n00:04:25.958 --> 00:04:27.958\nand computer science tells us that these are very hard questions.\n\n00:04:27.958 --> 00:04:29.958\nAlmost -- many of them are impossible.\n\n00:04:29.958 --> 00:04:32.958\nBut for some tasks, we can start to answer them.\n\n00:04:32.958 --> 00:04:33.958\nSo, I'm going to start asking those questions\n\n00:04:33.958 --> 00:04:36.958\nfor the DNA structures I'm going to talk about next.\n\n00:04:36.958 --> 00:04:39.958\nSo, this is normal DNA, what you think of as normal DNA.\n\n00:04:39.958 --> 00:04:41.958\nIt's double-stranded, it's a double helix,\n\n00:04:41.958 --> 00:04:44.958\nhas the As, Ts, Cs and Gs that pair to hold the strands together.\n\n00:04:44.958 --> 00:04:46.958\nAnd I'm going to draw it like this sometimes,\n\n00:04:46.958 --> 00:04:48.958\njust so I don't scare you.\n\n00:04:48.958 --> 00:04:51.958\nWe want to look at individual strands and not think about the double helix.\n\n00:04:51.958 --> 00:04:54.958\nWhen we synthesize it, it comes single-stranded,\n\n00:04:54.958 --> 00:04:57.958\nso we can take the blue strand in one tube\n\n00:04:57.958 --> 00:04:59.958\nand make an orange strand in the other tube,\n\n00:04:59.958 --> 00:05:01.958\nand they're floppy when they're single-stranded.\n\n00:05:01.958 --> 00:05:04.958\nYou mix them together and they make a rigid double helix.\n\n00:05:04.958 --> 00:05:06.958\nNow for the last 25 years,\n\n00:05:06.958 --> 00:05:08.958\nNed Seeman and a bunch of his descendants\n\n00:05:08.958 --> 00:05:11.958\nhave worked very hard and made beautiful three-dimensional structures\n\n00:05:11.958 --> 00:05:14.958\nusing this kind of reaction of DNA strands coming together.\n\n00:05:14.958 --> 00:05:17.958\nBut a lot of their approaches, though elegant, take a long time.\n\n00:05:17.958 --> 00:05:20.958\nThey can take a couple of years, or it can be difficult to design.\n\n00:05:20.958 --> 00:05:23.958\nSo I came up with a new method a couple of years ago\n\n00:05:23.958 --> 00:05:24.958\nI call DNA origami\n\n00:05:24.958 --> 00:05:26.958\nthat's so easy you could do it at home in your kitchen\n\n00:05:26.958 --> 00:05:28.958\nand design the stuff on a laptop.\n\n00:05:28.958 --> 00:05:31.958\nBut to do it, you need a long, single strand of DNA,\n\n00:05:31.958 --> 00:05:33.958\nwhich is technically very difficult to get.\n\n00:05:33.958 --> 00:05:35.958\nSo, you can go to a natural source.\n\n00:05:35.958 --> 00:05:37.958\nYou can look in this computer-fabricated artifact,\n\n00:05:37.958 --> 00:05:39.958\nand he's got a double-stranded genome -- that's no good.\n\n00:05:39.958 --> 00:05:42.958\nYou look in his intestines. There are billions of bacteria.\n\n00:05:42.958 --> 00:05:44.958\nThey're no good either.\n\n00:05:44.958 --> 00:05:46.958\nDouble strand again, but inside them, they're infected with a virus\n\n00:05:46.958 --> 00:05:49.958\nthat has a nice, long, single-stranded genome\n\n00:05:49.958 --> 00:05:51.958\nthat we can fold like a piece of paper.\n\n00:05:51.958 --> 00:05:52.958\nAnd here's how we do it.\n\n00:05:52.958 --> 00:05:53.958\nThis is part of that genome.\n\n00:05:53.958 --> 00:05:56.958\nWe add a bunch of short, synthetic DNAs that I call staples.\n\n00:05:56.958 --> 00:06:00.958\nEach one has a left half that binds the long strand in one place,\n\n00:06:00.958 --> 00:06:03.958\nand a right half that binds it in a different place,\n\n00:06:03.958 --> 00:06:05.958\nand brings the long strand together like this.\n\n00:06:06.958 --> 00:06:08.958\nThe net action of many of these on that long strand\n\n00:06:08.958 --> 00:06:10.958\nis to fold it into something like a rectangle.\n\n00:06:10.958 --> 00:06:12.958\nNow, we can't actually take a movie of this process,\n\n00:06:12.958 --> 00:06:14.958\nbut Shawn Douglas at Harvard\n\n00:06:14.958 --> 00:06:16.958\nhas made a nice visualization for us\n\n00:06:16.958 --> 00:06:20.958\nthat begins with a long strand and has some short strands in it.\n\n00:06:20.958 --> 00:06:24.958\nAnd what happens is that we mix these strands together.\n\n00:06:24.958 --> 00:06:26.958\nWe heat them up, we add a little bit of salt,\n\n00:06:26.958 --> 00:06:28.958\nwe heat them up to almost boiling and cool them down,\n\n00:06:28.958 --> 00:06:29.958\nand as we cool them down,\n\n00:06:29.958 --> 00:06:31.958\nthe short strands bind the long strands\n\n00:06:31.958 --> 00:06:33.958\nand start to form structure.\n\n00:06:33.958 --> 00:06:36.958\nAnd you can see a little bit of double helix forming there.\n\n00:06:37.958 --> 00:06:39.958\nWhen you look at DNA origami,\n\n00:06:39.958 --> 00:06:42.958\nyou can see that what it really is,\n\n00:06:42.958 --> 00:06:43.958\neven though you think it's complicated,\n\n00:06:43.958 --> 00:06:46.958\nis a bunch of double helices that are parallel to each other,\n\n00:06:46.958 --> 00:06:48.958\nand they're held together\n\n00:06:48.958 --> 00:06:50.958\nby places where short strands go along one helix\n\n00:06:50.958 --> 00:06:52.958\nand then jump to another one.\n\n00:06:52.958 --> 00:06:55.958\nSo there's a strand that goes like this, goes along one helix and binds --\n\n00:06:55.958 --> 00:06:57.958\nit jumps to another helix and comes back.\n\n00:06:57.958 --> 00:06:59.958\nThat holds the long strand like this.\n\n00:06:59.958 --> 00:07:02.958\nNow, to show that we could make any shape or pattern\n\n00:07:02.958 --> 00:07:04.958\nthat we wanted, I tried to make this shape.\n\n00:07:05.958 --> 00:07:07.958\nI wanted to fold DNA into something that goes up over the eye,\n\n00:07:07.958 --> 00:07:10.958\ndown the nose, up the nose, around the forehead,\n\n00:07:10.958 --> 00:07:13.958\nback down and end in a little loop like this.\n\n00:07:13.958 --> 00:07:16.958\nAnd so, I thought, if this could work, anything could work.\n\n00:07:16.958 --> 00:07:19.958\nSo I had the computer program design the short staples to do this.\n\n00:07:19.958 --> 00:07:21.958\nI ordered them; they came by FedEx.\n\n00:07:21.958 --> 00:07:23.958\nI mixed them up, heated them, cooled them down,\n\n00:07:23.958 --> 00:07:27.958\nand I got 50 billion little smiley faces\n\n00:07:27.958 --> 00:07:29.958\nfloating around in a single drop of water.\n\n00:07:29.958 --> 00:07:31.958\nAnd each one of these is just\n\n00:07:31.958 --> 00:07:35.958\none-thousandth the width of a human hair, OK?\n\n00:07:35.958 --> 00:07:38.958\nSo, they're all floating around in solution, and to look at them,\n\n00:07:38.958 --> 00:07:40.958\nyou have to get them on a surface where they stick.\n\n00:07:40.958 --> 00:07:42.958\nSo, you pour them out onto a surface\n\n00:07:42.958 --> 00:07:44.958\nand they start to stick to that surface,\n\n00:07:44.958 --> 00:07:46.958\nand we take a picture using an atomic-force microscope.\n\n00:07:46.958 --> 00:07:48.958\nIt's got a needle, like a record needle,\n\n00:07:48.958 --> 00:07:50.958\nthat goes back and forth over the surface,\n\n00:07:50.958 --> 00:07:53.958\nbumps up and down, and feels the height of the first surface.\n\n00:07:53.958 --> 00:07:55.958\nIt feels the DNA origami.\n\n00:07:55.958 --> 00:07:57.958\nThere's the atomic-force microscope working\n\n00:07:58.958 --> 00:07:59.958\nand you can see that the landing's a little rough.\n\n00:07:59.958 --> 00:08:01.958\nWhen you zoom in, they've got, you know,\n\n00:08:01.958 --> 00:08:02.958\nweak jaws that flip over their heads\n\n00:08:02.958 --> 00:08:05.958\nand some of their noses get punched out, but it's pretty good.\n\n00:08:05.958 --> 00:08:07.958\nYou can zoom in and even see the extra little loop,\n\n00:08:07.958 --> 00:08:09.958\nthis little nano-goatee.\n\n00:08:09.958 --> 00:08:12.958\nNow, what's great about this is anybody can do this.\n\n00:08:12.958 --> 00:08:16.958\nAnd so, I got this in the mail about a year after I did this, unsolicited.\n\n00:08:16.958 --> 00:08:19.958\nAnyone know what this is? What is it?\n\n00:08:19.958 --> 00:08:21.958\nIt's China, right?\n\n00:08:21.958 --> 00:08:23.958\nSo, what happened is, a graduate student in China,\n\n00:08:23.958 --> 00:08:25.958\nLulu Qian, did a great job.\n\n00:08:25.958 --> 00:08:27.958\nShe wrote all her own software\n\n00:08:27.958 --> 00:08:29.958\nto design and built this DNA origami,\n\n00:08:29.958 --> 00:08:32.958\na beautiful rendition of China, which even has Taiwan,\n\n00:08:32.958 --> 00:08:35.958\nand you can see it's sort of on the world's shortest leash, right?\n\n00:08:35.958 --> 00:08:37.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:08:38.958 --> 00:08:39.958\nSo, this works really well\n\n00:08:40.958 --> 00:08:42.958\nand you can make patterns as well as shapes, OK?\n\n00:08:43.958 --> 00:08:46.958\nAnd you can make a map of the Americas and spell DNA with DNA.\n\n00:08:46.958 --> 00:08:49.958\nAnd what's really neat about it --\n\n00:08:49.958 --> 00:08:51.958\nwell, actually, this all looks like nano-artwork,\n\n00:08:51.958 --> 00:08:52.958\nbut it turns out that nano-artwork\n\n00:08:52.958 --> 00:08:54.958\nis just what you need to make nano-circuits.\n\n00:08:54.958 --> 00:08:56.958\nSo, you can put circuit components on the staples,\n\n00:08:56.958 --> 00:08:58.958\nlike a light bulb and a light switch.\n\n00:08:58.958 --> 00:09:01.958\nLet the thing assemble, and you'll get some kind of a circuit.\n\n00:09:01.958 --> 00:09:04.958\nAnd then you can maybe wash the DNA away and have the circuit left over.\n\n00:09:04.958 --> 00:09:06.958\nSo, this is what some colleagues of mine at Caltech did.\n\n00:09:06.958 --> 00:09:09.958\nThey took a DNA origami, organized some carbon nano-tubes,\n\n00:09:09.958 --> 00:09:11.958\nmade a little switch, you see here, wired it up,\n\n00:09:11.958 --> 00:09:14.958\ntested it and showed that it is indeed a switch.\n\n00:09:14.958 --> 00:09:16.958\nNow, this is just a single switch\n\n00:09:16.958 --> 00:09:20.958\nand you need half a billion for a computer, so we have a long way to go.\n\n00:09:20.958 --> 00:09:22.958\nBut this is very promising\n\n00:09:22.958 --> 00:09:27.958\nbecause the origami can organize parts just one-tenth the size\n\n00:09:27.958 --> 00:09:28.958\nof those in a normal computer.\n\n00:09:28.958 --> 00:09:31.958\nSo it's very promising for making small computers.\n\n00:09:31.958 --> 00:09:34.958\nNow, I want to get back to that compiler.\n\n00:09:34.958 --> 00:09:37.958\nThe DNA origami is a proof that that compiler actually works.\n\n00:09:38.958 --> 00:09:40.958\nSo, you start with something in the computer.\n\n00:09:40.958 --> 00:09:43.958\nYou get a high-level description of the computer program,\n\n00:09:43.958 --> 00:09:45.958\na high-level description of the origami.\n\n00:09:45.958 --> 00:09:48.958\nYou can compile it to molecules, send it to a synthesizer,\n\n00:09:48.958 --> 00:09:49.958\nand it actually works.\n\n00:09:49.958 --> 00:09:53.958\nAnd it turns out that a company has made a nice program\n\n00:09:53.958 --> 00:09:55.958\nthat's much better than my code, which was kind of ugly,\n\n00:09:55.958 --> 00:09:56.958\nand will allow us to do this in a nice,\n\n00:09:56.958 --> 00:09:58.958\nvisual, computer-aided design way.\n\n00:09:59.958 --> 00:10:00.958\nSo, now you can say, all right,\n\n00:10:00.958 --> 00:10:02.958\nwhy isn't DNA origami the end of the story?\n\n00:10:02.958 --> 00:10:04.958\nYou have your molecular compiler, you can do whatever you want.\n\n00:10:04.958 --> 00:10:07.958\nThe fact is that it does not scale.\n\n00:10:07.958 --> 00:10:10.958\nSo if you want to build a human from DNA origami,\n\n00:10:10.958 --> 00:10:12.958\nthe problem is, you need a long strand\n\n00:10:12.958 --> 00:10:15.958\nthat's 10 trillion trillion bases long.\n\n00:10:15.958 --> 00:10:17.958\nThat's three light years' worth of DNA,\n\n00:10:17.958 --> 00:10:19.958\nso we're not going to do this.\n\n00:10:19.958 --> 00:10:21.958\nWe're going to turn to another technology,\n\n00:10:21.958 --> 00:10:23.958\ncalled algorithmic self-assembly of tiles.\n\n00:10:23.958 --> 00:10:25.958\nIt was started by Erik Winfree,\n\n00:10:25.958 --> 00:10:26.958\nand what it does,\n\n00:10:26.958 --> 00:10:30.958\nit has tiles that are a hundredth the size of a DNA origami.\n\n00:10:30.958 --> 00:10:32.958\nYou zoom in, there are just four DNA strands\n\n00:10:33.958 --> 00:10:35.958\nand they have little single-stranded bits on them\n\n00:10:35.958 --> 00:10:37.958\nthat can bind to other tiles, if they match.\n\n00:10:37.958 --> 00:10:40.958\nAnd we like to draw these tiles as little squares.\n\n00:10:41.958 --> 00:10:43.958\nAnd if you look at their sticky ends, these little DNA bits,\n\n00:10:43.958 --> 00:10:46.958\nyou can see that they actually form a checkerboard pattern.\n\n00:10:46.958 --> 00:10:49.958\nSo, these tiles would make a complicated, self-assembling checkerboard.\n\n00:10:49.958 --> 00:10:51.958\nAnd the point of this, if you didn't catch that,\n\n00:10:51.958 --> 00:10:54.958\nis that tiles are a kind of molecular program\n\n00:10:54.958 --> 00:10:57.958\nand they can output patterns.\n\n00:10:57.958 --> 00:10:59.958\nAnd a really amazing part of this is\n\n00:10:59.958 --> 00:11:01.958\nthat any computer program can be translated\n\n00:11:01.958 --> 00:11:04.958\ninto one of these tile programs -- specifically, counting.\n\n00:11:04.958 --> 00:11:07.958\nSo, you can come up with a set of tiles\n\n00:11:07.958 --> 00:11:10.958\nthat when they come together, form a little binary counter\n\n00:11:10.958 --> 00:11:12.958\nrather than a checkerboard.\n\n00:11:12.958 --> 00:11:15.958\nSo you can read off binary numbers five, six and seven.\n\n00:11:15.958 --> 00:11:18.958\nAnd in order to get these kinds of computations started right,\n\n00:11:18.958 --> 00:11:20.958\nyou need some kind of input, a kind of seed.\n\n00:11:20.958 --> 00:11:22.958\nYou can use DNA origami for that.\n\n00:11:22.958 --> 00:11:24.958\nYou can encode the number 32\n\n00:11:24.958 --> 00:11:26.958\nin the right-hand side of a DNA origami,\n\n00:11:26.958 --> 00:11:28.958\nand when you add those tiles that count,\n\n00:11:28.958 --> 00:11:31.958\nthey will start to count -- they will read that 32\n\n00:11:31.958 --> 00:11:33.958\nand they'll stop at 32.\n\n00:11:33.958 --> 00:11:36.958\nSo, what we've done is we've figured out a way\n\n00:11:36.958 --> 00:11:39.958\nto have a molecular program know when to stop going.\n\n00:11:39.958 --> 00:11:41.958\nIt knows when to stop growing because it can count.\n\n00:11:41.958 --> 00:11:43.958\nIt knows how big it is.\n\n00:11:43.958 --> 00:11:46.958\nSo, that answers that sort of first question I was talking about.\n\n00:11:46.958 --> 00:11:49.958\nIt doesn't tell us how babies do it, however.\n\n00:11:49.958 --> 00:11:53.958\nSo now, we can use this counting to try and get at much bigger things\n\n00:11:53.958 --> 00:11:54.958\nthan DNA origami could otherwise.\n\n00:11:54.958 --> 00:11:57.958\nHere's the DNA origami, and what we can do\n\n00:11:57.958 --> 00:12:00.958\nis we can write 32 on both edges of the DNA origami,\n\n00:12:00.958 --> 00:12:02.958\nand we can now use our watering can\n\n00:12:02.958 --> 00:12:06.958\nand water with tiles, and we can start growing tiles off of that\n\n00:12:06.958 --> 00:12:08.958\nand create a square.\n\n00:12:08.958 --> 00:12:11.958\nThe counter serves as a template\n\n00:12:11.958 --> 00:12:13.958\nto fill in a square in the middle of this thing.\n\n00:12:13.958 --> 00:12:14.958\nSo, what we've done is we've succeeded\n\n00:12:14.958 --> 00:12:17.958\nin making something much bigger than a DNA origami\n\n00:12:17.958 --> 00:12:20.958\nby combining DNA origami with tiles.\n\n00:12:20.958 --> 00:12:23.958\nAnd the neat thing about it is, is that it's also reprogrammable.\n\n00:12:23.958 --> 00:12:27.958\nYou can just change a couple of the DNA strands in this binary representation\n\n00:12:27.958 --> 00:12:30.958\nand you'll get 96 rather than 32.\n\n00:12:30.958 --> 00:12:33.958\nAnd if you do that, the origami's the same size,\n\n00:12:33.958 --> 00:12:37.958\nbut the resulting square that you get is three times bigger.\n\n00:12:38.958 --> 00:12:39.958\nSo, this sort of recapitulates\n\n00:12:39.958 --> 00:12:41.958\nwhat I was telling you about development.\n\n00:12:41.958 --> 00:12:44.958\nYou have a very sensitive computer program\n\n00:12:44.958 --> 00:12:47.958\nwhere small changes -- single, tiny, little mutations --\n\n00:12:47.958 --> 00:12:49.958\ncan take something that made one size square\n\n00:12:49.958 --> 00:12:52.958\nand make something very much bigger.\n\n00:12:53.958 --> 00:12:56.958\nNow, this -- using counting to compute\n\n00:12:56.958 --> 00:12:58.958\nand build these kinds of things\n\n00:12:58.958 --> 00:13:00.958\nby this kind of developmental process\n\n00:13:00.958 --> 00:13:04.958\nis something that also has bearing on Craig Venter's question.\n\n00:13:04.958 --> 00:13:06.958\nSo, you can ask, how many DNA strands are required\n\n00:13:06.958 --> 00:13:08.958\nto build a square of a given size?\n\n00:13:08.958 --> 00:13:13.958\nIf we wanted to make a square of size 10, 100 or 1,000,\n\n00:13:13.958 --> 00:13:15.958\nif we used DNA origami alone,\n\n00:13:15.958 --> 00:13:18.958\nwe would require a number of DNA strands that's the square\n\n00:13:18.958 --> 00:13:20.958\nof the size of that square;\n\n00:13:20.958 --> 00:13:22.958\nso we'd need 100, 10,000 or a million DNA strands.\n\n00:13:22.958 --> 00:13:24.958\nThat's really not affordable.\n\n00:13:24.958 --> 00:13:26.958\nBut if we use a little computation --\n\n00:13:26.958 --> 00:13:30.958\nwe use origami, plus some tiles that count --\n\n00:13:30.958 --> 00:13:33.958\nthen we can get away with using 100, 200 or 300 DNA strands.\n\n00:13:33.958 --> 00:13:38.958\nAnd so we can exponentially reduce the number of DNA strands we use,\n\n00:13:38.958 --> 00:13:41.958\nif we use counting, if we use a little bit of computation.\n\n00:13:41.958 --> 00:13:44.958\nAnd so computation is some very powerful way\n\n00:13:44.958 --> 00:13:47.958\nto reduce the number of molecules you need to build something,\n\n00:13:47.958 --> 00:13:50.958\nto reduce the size of the genome that you're building.\n\n00:13:50.958 --> 00:13:53.958\nAnd finally, I'm going to get back to that sort of crazy idea\n\n00:13:53.958 --> 00:13:55.958\nabout computers building computers.\n\n00:13:55.958 --> 00:13:58.958\nIf you look at the square that you build with the origami\n\n00:13:58.958 --> 00:14:00.958\nand some counters growing off it,\n\n00:14:00.958 --> 00:14:03.958\nthe pattern that it has is exactly the pattern that you need\n\n00:14:03.958 --> 00:14:04.958\nto make a memory.\n\n00:14:04.958 --> 00:14:07.958\nSo if you affix some wires and switches to those tiles --\n\n00:14:07.958 --> 00:14:10.958\nrather than to the staple strands, you affix them to the tiles --\n\n00:14:10.958 --> 00:14:13.958\nthen they'll self-assemble the somewhat complicated circuits,\n\n00:14:13.958 --> 00:14:16.958\nthe demultiplexer circuits, that you need to address this memory.\n\n00:14:16.958 --> 00:14:18.958\nSo you can actually make a complicated circuit\n\n00:14:18.958 --> 00:14:20.958\nusing a little bit of computation.\n\n00:14:20.958 --> 00:14:23.958\nIt's a molecular computer building an electronic computer.\n\n00:14:23.958 --> 00:14:26.958\nNow, you ask me, how far have we gotten down this path?\n\n00:14:26.958 --> 00:14:29.958\nExperimentally, this is what we've done in the last year.\n\n00:14:29.958 --> 00:14:31.958\nHere is a DNA origami rectangle,\n\n00:14:32.958 --> 00:14:34.958\nand here are some tiles growing from it.\n\n00:14:34.958 --> 00:14:36.958\nAnd you can see how they count.\n\n00:14:36.958 --> 00:14:48.958\nOne, two, three, four, five, six, nine, 10, 11, 12, 17.\n\n00:14:48.958 --> 00:14:52.958\nSo it's got some errors, but at least it counts up.\n\n00:14:52.958 --> 00:14:53.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:14:53.958 --> 00:14:56.958\nSo, it turns out we actually had this idea nine years ago,\n\n00:14:56.958 --> 00:14:59.958\nand that's about the time constant for how long it takes\n\n00:14:59.958 --> 00:15:01.958\nto do these kinds of things, so I think we made a lot of progress.\n\n00:15:01.958 --> 00:15:03.958\nWe've got ideas about how to fix these errors.\n\n00:15:03.958 --> 00:15:05.958\nAnd I think in the next five or 10 years,\n\n00:15:05.958 --> 00:15:07.958\nwe'll make the kind of squares that I described\n\n00:15:07.958 --> 00:15:10.958\nand maybe even get to some of those self-assembled circuits.\n\n00:15:10.958 --> 00:15:14.958\nSo now, what do I want you to take away from this talk?\n\n00:15:14.958 --> 00:15:16.958\nI want you to remember that\n\n00:15:16.958 --> 00:15:20.958\nto create life's very diverse and complex forms,\n\n00:15:20.958 --> 00:15:22.958\nlife uses computation to do that.\n\n00:15:22.958 --> 00:15:26.958\nAnd the computations that it uses, they're molecular computations,\n\n00:15:26.958 --> 00:15:28.958\nand in order to understand this and get a better handle on it,\n\n00:15:28.958 --> 00:15:30.958\nas Feynman said, you know,\n\n00:15:30.958 --> 00:15:32.958\nwe need to build something to understand it.\n\n00:15:32.958 --> 00:15:36.958\nAnd so we are going to use molecules and refashion this thing,\n\n00:15:36.958 --> 00:15:38.958\nrebuild everything from the bottom up,\n\n00:15:38.958 --> 00:15:41.958\nusing DNA in ways that nature never intended,\n\n00:15:41.958 --> 00:15:43.958\nusing DNA origami,\n\n00:15:43.958 --> 00:15:46.958\nand DNA origami to seed this algorithmic self-assembly.\n\n00:15:46.958 --> 00:15:48.958\nYou know, so this is all very cool,\n\n00:15:49.958 --> 00:15:50.958\nbut what I'd like you to take from the talk,\n\n00:15:50.958 --> 00:15:52.958\nhopefully from some of those big questions,\n\n00:15:52.958 --> 00:15:55.958\nis that this molecular programming isn't just about making gadgets.\n\n00:15:55.958 --> 00:15:57.958\nIt's not just making about --\n\n00:15:57.958 --> 00:15:59.958\nit's making self-assembled cell phones and circuits.\n\n00:15:59.958 --> 00:16:01.958\nWhat it's really about is taking computer science\n\n00:16:01.958 --> 00:16:04.958\nand looking at big questions in a new light,\n\n00:16:04.958 --> 00:16:06.958\nasking new versions of those big questions\n\n00:16:06.958 --> 00:16:08.958\nand trying to understand how biology\n\n00:16:08.958 --> 00:16:10.958\ncan make such amazing things. Thank you.\n\n00:16:11.958 --> 00:16:18.958\n(Applause)"}, {"title": "Our next giant leap", "duration": "931", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/peter_diamandis_on_our_next_giant_leap", "transcript": "My mission in life since I was a kid was, and is, to take the rest of you into space. It's during our lifetime that we're going to take the Earth, take the people of Earth and transition off, permanently. And that's exciting. In fact, I think it is a moral imperative that we open the space frontier. You know, it's the first time that we're going to have a chance to have planetary redundancy, a chance to, if you would, back up the biosphere. And if you think about space, everything we hold of value on this planet \u2014 metals and minerals and real estate and energy \u2014 is in infinite quantities in space.In fact, the Earth is a crumb in a supermarket filled with resources. The analogy for me is Alaska. You know, we bought Alaska. We Americans bought Alaska in the 1850s. It's called Seward's folly. We valued it as the number of seal pelts we could kill. And then we discovered these things \u2014 gold and oil and fishing and timber \u2014 and it became, you know, a trillion-dollar economy, and now we take our honeymoons there. The same thing will happen in space. We are on the verge of the greatest exploration that the human race has ever known.We explore for three reasons, the weakest of which is curiosity. You know, it's funded NASA's budget up until now. Some images from Mars, 1997. In fact, I think in the next decade, without any question, we will discover life on Mars and find that it is literally ubiquitous under the soils and different parts of that planet.The stronger motivator, the much stronger motivator, is fear. It drove us to the moon. We \u2014 literally in fear \u2014 with the Soviet Union raced to the moon. And we have these huge rocks, you know, killer-sized rocks in the hundreds of thousands or millions out there, and while the probability is very small, the impact, figured in literally, of one of these hitting the Earth is so huge that to spend a small fraction looking, searching, preparing to defend, is not unreasonable.And of course, the third motivator, one near and dear to my heart as an entrepreneur, is wealth. In fact, the greatest wealth. If you think about these other asteroids, there's a class of the nickel iron, which in platinum-group metal markets alone are worth something like 20 trillion dollars, if you can go out and grab one of these rocks. My plan is to actually buy puts on the precious metal market, and then actually claim that I'm going to go out and get one. And that will fund the actual mission to go and get one. But fear, curiosity and greed have driven us. And for me, this is \u2014 I'm the short kid on the right. This was \u2014 my motivation was actually during Apollo.And Apollo was one of the greatest motivators ever. If you think about what happened at the turn of \u2014 early 1960s, on May 25, JFK said, \"We're going to go to the moon.\" And people left their jobs and they went to obscure locations to go and be part of this amazing mission. And we knew nothing about going to space. We went from having literally put Alan Shepard in suborbital flight to going to the moon in eight years, and the average age of the people that got us there was 26 years old. They didn't know what couldn't be done. They had to make up everything. And that, my friend, is amazing motivation. This is Gene Cernan, a good friend of mine, saying, \"If I can go to the moon\" \u2014 this is the last human on the moon so far \u2014 \"nothing, nothing is impossible.\" But of course, we've thought about the government always as the person taking us there.But I put forward here, the government is not going to get us there. The government is unable to take the risks required to open up this precious frontier. The shuttle is costing a billion dollars a launch. That's a pathetic number. It's unreasonable. We shouldn't be happy in standing for that. One of the things that we did with the Ansari X PRIZE was take the challenge on that risk is OK, you know. As we are going out there and taking on a new frontier, we should be allowed to risk. In fact, anyone who says we shouldn't, you know, just needs to be put aside, because, as we go forward, in fact, the greatest discoveries we will ever know is ahead of us. The entrepreneurs in the space business are the furry mammals, and clearly the industrial-military complex \u2014 with Boeing and Lockheed and NASA \u2014 are the dinosaurs. The ability for us to access these resources to gain planetary redundancy \u2014 we can now gather all the information, the genetic codes, you know, everything stored on our databases, and back them up off the planet, in case there would be one of those disastrous situations.The difficulty is getting there, and clearly, the cost to orbit is key. Once you're in orbit, you are two thirds of the way, energetically, to anywhere \u2014 the moon, to Mars. And today, there's only three vehicles \u2014 the U.S. shuttle, the Russian Soyuz and the Chinese vehicle \u2014 that gets you there. Arguably, it's about 100 million dollars a person on the space shuttle. One of the companies I started, Space Adventures, will sell you a ticket. We've done two so far. We'll be announcing two more on the Soyuz to go up to the space station for 20 million dollars. But that's expensive and to understand what the potential is \u2014(Laughter) \u2014it is expensive. But people are willing to pay that! You know, one \u2014 we have a very unique period in time today. For the first time ever, we have enough wealth concentrated in the hands of few individuals and the technology accessible that will allow us to really drive space exploration. But how cheap could it get? I want to give you the end point. We know \u2014 20 million dollars today, you can go and buy a ticket, but how cheap could it get?Let's go back to high school physics here. If you calculate the amount of potential energy, mgh, to take you and your spacesuit up to a couple hundred miles, and then you accelerate yourself to 17,500 miles per hour \u2014 remember, that one half MV squared \u2014 and you figure it out. It's about 5.7 gigajoules of energy. If you expended that over an hour, it's about 1.6 megawatts. If you go to one of Vijay's micro-power sources, and they sell it to you for seven cents a kilowatt hour \u2014 anybody here fast in math? How much will it cost you and your spacesuit to go to orbit? 100 bucks. That's the price-improvement curve that \u2014 we need some breakthroughs in physics along the way, I'll grant you that.(Laughter)But guys, if history has taught us anything, it's that if you can imagine it, you will get there eventually. I have no question that the physics, the engineering to get us down to the point where all of us can afford orbital space flight is around the corner. The difficulty is that there needs to be a real marketplace to drive the investment. Today, the Boeings and the Lockheeds don't spend a dollar of their own money in R&D. It's all government research dollars, and very few of those. And in fact, the large corporations, the governments, can't take the risk. So we need what I call an exothermic economic reaction in space. Today's commercial markets worldwide, global commercial launch market? 12 to 15 launches per year. Number of commercial companies out there? 12 to 15 companies. One per company. That's not it. There's only one marketplace, and I call them self-loading carbon payloads. They come with their own money. They're easy to make. It's people. The Ansari X PRIZE was my solution, reading about Lindbergh for creating the vehicles to get us there.We offered 10 million dollars in cash for the first reusable ship, carry three people up to 100 kilometers, come back down, and within two weeks, make the trip again. Twenty-six teams from seven countries entered the competition, spending between one to 25 million dollars each. And of course, we had beautiful SpaceShipOne, which made those two flights and won the competition. And I'd like to take you there, to that morning, for just a quick video.(Video) Pilot: Release our fire.Richard Searfoss: Good luck.(Applause)RS: We've got an altitude call of 368,000 feet.(Applause)RS: So in my official capacity as the chief judge of the Ansari X PRIZE competition, I declare that Mojave Aerospace Ventures has indeed earned the Ansari X PRIZE.(Applause)Peter Diamandis: Probably the most difficult thing that I had to do was raise the capital for this. It was literally impossible. We went \u2014 I went to 100, 200 CEOs, CMOs. No one believed it was done. Everyone said, \"Oh, what does NASA think? Well, people are going to die, how can you possibly going to put this forward?\" I found a visionary family, the Ansari family, and Champ Car, and raised part of the money, but not the full 10 million.And what I ended up doing was going out to the insurance industry and buying a hole-in-one insurance policy. See, the insurance companies went to Boeing and Lockheed, and said, \"Are you going to compete?\" No. \"Are you going to compete?\" No. \"No one's going to win this thing.\" So, they took a bet that no one would win by January of '05, and I took a bet that someone would win.(Applause)So \u2014 and the best thing is they paid off and the check didn't bounce.(Laughter)We've had a lot of accomplishments and it's been a tremendous success. One of the things I'm most happy about is that the SpaceShipOne is going to hang in Air and Space Museum, next to the Spirit of St. Louis and the Wright Flyer. Isn't that great? (Applause) So a little bit about the future, steps to space, what's available for you. Today, you can go and experience weightless flights. By '08, suborbital flights, the price tag for that, you know, on Virgin, is going to be about 200,000. There are three or four other serious efforts that will bring the price down very rapidly, I think, to about 25,000 dollars for a suborbital flight. Orbital flights \u2014 we can take you to the space station.And then I truly believe, once a group is in orbit around the Earth \u2014 I know if they don't do it, I am \u2014 we're going to stockpile some fuel, make a beeline for the moon and grab some real estate.(Laughter)Quick moment for the designers in the audience. We spent 11 years getting FAA approval to do zero gravity flights. Here are some fun images. Here's Burt Rutan and my good friend Greg Meronek inside a zero gravity \u2014 people think a zero gravity room, there's a switch on there that turns it off \u2014 but it's actually parabolic flight of an airplane. And turns out 7-Up has just done a little commercial that's airing this month. If we can get the audio up?(Video) Narrator: For a chance to win the first free ticket to space, look for specially marked packages of Diet 7-Up. When you want the taste that won't weigh you down, the only way to go is up.PD: That was filmed inside our airplane, and so, you can now do this. We're based down in Florida. Let me talk about the other thing I'm excited about. The future of prizes. You know, prizes are a very old idea. I had the pleasure of borrowing from the Longitude Prize and the Orteig Prize that put Lindbergh forward. And we have made a decision in the X PRIZE Foundation to actually carry that concept forward into other technology areas, and we just took on a new mission statement: \"to bring about radical breakthroughs in space and other technologies for the benefit of humanity.\" And this is something that we're very excited about. I showed this slide to Larry Page, who just joined our board.And you know, when you give to a nonprofit, you might have 50 cents on the dollar. If you have a matching grant, it's typically two or three to one. If you put up a prize, you can get literally a 50 to one leverage on your dollars. And that's huge. And then he turned around and said, \"Well, if you back a prize institute that runs a 10 prize, you get 500 to one.\" I said, \"Well, that's great.\" So, we have actually \u2014 are looking to turn the X PRIZE into a world-class prize institute. This is what happens when you put up a prize, when you announce it and teams start to begin doing trials. You get publicity increase, and when it's won, publicity shoots through the roof \u2014 if it's properly managed \u2014 and that's part of the benefits to a sponsor. Then, when the prize is actually won, after it's moving, you get societal benefits, you know, new technology, new capability. And the benefit to the sponsors is the sum of the publicity and societal benefits over the long term. That's our value proposition in a prize.If you were going to go and try to create SpaceShipOne, or any kind of a new technology, you have to fund that from the beginning and maintain that funding with an uncertain outcome. It may or may not happen. But if you put up a prize, the beautiful thing is, you know, it's a very small maintenance fee, and you pay on success. Orteig didn't pay a dime out to the nine teams that went across \u2014 tried to go across the Atlantic, and we didn't pay a dime until someone won the Ansari X PRIZE. So, prizes work great. You know, innovators, the entrepreneurs out there, you know that when you're going for a goal, the first thing you have to do is believe that you can do it yourself. Then, you've got to, you know, face potential public ridicule of \u2014 that's a crazy idea, it'll never work. And then you have to convince others, so that they can, in fact, help you raise the funds, and then you've got to deal with the fact that you've got government bureaucracies and institutions that don't want you to move those things forward, and you have to deal with failures. What a prize does, what we've experienced a prize doing, is literally help to short-circuit or support all of these things, because a prize credentials the idea that this is a good idea. Well, it must be a good idea. Someone's offering 10 million dollars to go and do this thing.And each of these areas was something that we found the Ansari X PRIZE helped short-circuit these for innovation. So, as an organization, we put together a prize discovery process of how to come up with prizes and write the rules, and we're actually looking at creating prizes in a number of different categories. We're looking at attacking energy, environment, nanotechnology \u2014 and I'll talk about those more in a moment. And the way we're doing that is we're creating prize teams within the X PRIZE. We have a space prize team. We're going after an orbital prize.We are looking at a number of energy prizes. Craig Venter has just joined our board and we're doing a rapid genome sequencing prize with him, we'll be announcing later this fall, about \u2014 imagine being able to sequence anybody's DNA for under 1,000 dollars, revolutionize medicine. And clean water, education, medicine and even looking at social entrepreneurship. So my final slide here is, the most critical tool for solving humanity's grand challenges \u2014 it isn't technology, it isn't money, it's only one thing \u2014 it's the committed, passionate human mind.(Applause)", "id": 335, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:11.958 --> 00:00:14.958\nMy mission in life since I was a kid was,\n\n00:00:14.958 --> 00:00:17.958\nand is, to take the rest of you into space.\n\n00:00:17.958 --> 00:00:21.958\nIt's during our lifetime that we're going to take the Earth,\n\n00:00:21.958 --> 00:00:25.958\ntake the people of Earth and transition off, permanently.

And we have these huge rocks,\n\n00:01:49.958 --> 00:01:54.958\nyou know, killer-sized rocks in the hundreds of thousands or millions out there,\n\n00:01:54.958 --> 00:01:56.958\nand while the probability is very small,\n\n00:01:56.958 --> 00:01:58.958\nthe impact, figured in literally,\n\n00:01:58.958 --> 00:02:01.958\nof one of these hitting the Earth is so huge\n\n00:02:01.958 --> 00:02:04.958\nthat to spend a small fraction looking, searching,\n\n00:02:04.958 --> 00:02:06.958\npreparing to defend, is not unreasonable.\n\n00:02:06.958 --> 00:02:08.958\nAnd of course, the third motivator,\n\n00:02:08.958 --> 00:02:12.958\none near and dear to my heart as an entrepreneur, is wealth.\n\n00:02:12.958 --> 00:02:16.958\nIn fact, the greatest wealth. If you think about these other asteroids,\n\n00:02:16.958 --> 00:02:18.958\nthere's a class of the nickel iron,\n\n00:02:18.958 --> 00:02:20.958\nwhich in platinum-group metal markets alone\n\n00:02:20.958 --> 00:02:22.958\nare worth something like 20 trillion dollars,\n\n00:02:22.958 --> 00:02:24.958\nif you can go out and grab one of these rocks.\n\n00:02:24.958 --> 00:02:27.958\nMy plan is to actually buy puts on the precious metal market,\n\n00:02:27.958 --> 00:02:29.958\nand then actually claim that I'm going to go out and get one.\n\n00:02:29.958 --> 00:02:32.958\nAnd that will fund the actual mission to go and get one.\n\n00:02:32.958 --> 00:02:35.958\nBut fear, curiosity and greed have driven us.\n\n00:02:35.958 --> 00:02:39.958\nAnd for me, this is -- I'm the short kid on the right.\n\n00:02:39.958 --> 00:02:43.958\nThis was -- my motivation was actually during Apollo.\n\n00:02:43.958 --> 00:02:45.958\nAnd Apollo was one of the greatest motivators ever.\n\n00:02:45.958 --> 00:02:51.958\nIf you think about what happened at the turn of -- early 1960s,\n\n00:02:51.958 --> 00:02:55.958\non May 25, JFK said, \"We're going to go to the moon.\"\n\n00:02:55.958 --> 00:02:58.958\nAnd people left their jobs and they went to obscure locations\n\n00:02:58.958 --> 00:03:01.958\nto go and be part of this amazing mission.\n\n00:03:01.958 --> 00:03:03.958\nAnd we knew nothing about going to space.\n\n00:03:03.958 --> 00:03:06.958\nWe went from having literally put Alan Shepard in suborbital flight\n\n00:03:06.958 --> 00:03:08.958\nto going to the moon in eight years,\n\n00:03:08.958 --> 00:03:14.958\nand the average age of the people that got us there was 26 years old.\n\n00:03:14.958 --> 00:03:15.958\nThey didn't know what couldn't be done.\n\n00:03:15.958 --> 00:03:18.958\nThey had to make up everything.\n\n00:03:18.958 --> 00:03:20.958\nAnd that, my friend, is amazing motivation.\n\n00:03:20.958 --> 00:03:23.958\nThis is Gene Cernan, a good friend of mine, saying,\n\n00:03:23.958 --> 00:03:27.958\n\"If I can go to the moon\" -- this is the last human on the moon so far --\n\n00:03:27.958 --> 00:03:30.958\n\"nothing, nothing is impossible.\" But of course,\n\n00:03:30.958 --> 00:03:34.958\nwe've thought about the government always as the person taking us there.\n\n00:03:34.958 --> 00:03:38.958\nBut I put forward here, the government is not going to get us there.\n\n00:03:38.958 --> 00:03:43.958\nThe government is unable to take the risks required to open up this precious frontier.\n\n00:03:43.958 --> 00:03:45.958\nThe shuttle is costing a billion dollars a launch.\n\n00:03:45.958 --> 00:03:48.958\nThat's a pathetic number. It's unreasonable.\n\n00:03:48.958 --> 00:03:51.958\nWe shouldn't be happy in standing for that.\n\n00:03:51.958 --> 00:03:53.958\nOne of the things that we did with the Ansari X PRIZE\n\n00:03:53.958 --> 00:03:57.958\nwas take the challenge on that risk is OK, you know.\n\n00:03:57.958 --> 00:04:00.958\nAs we are going out there and taking on a new frontier,\n\n00:04:00.958 --> 00:04:02.958\nwe should be allowed to risk.\n\n00:04:02.958 --> 00:04:05.958\nIn fact, anyone who says we shouldn't, you know,\n\n00:04:05.958 --> 00:04:09.958\njust needs to be put aside, because, as we go forward,\n\n00:04:09.958 --> 00:04:13.958\nin fact, the greatest discoveries we will ever know is ahead of us.\n\n00:04:13.958 --> 00:04:16.958\nThe entrepreneurs in the space business are the furry mammals,\n\n00:04:16.958 --> 00:04:18.958\nand clearly the industrial-military complex --\n\n00:04:18.958 --> 00:04:22.958\nwith Boeing and Lockheed and NASA -- are the dinosaurs.\n\n00:04:22.958 --> 00:04:25.958\nThe ability for us to access these resources\n\n00:04:25.958 --> 00:04:27.958\nto gain planetary redundancy --\n\n00:04:27.958 --> 00:04:30.958\nwe can now gather all the information, the genetic codes,\n\n00:04:30.958 --> 00:04:32.958\nyou know, everything stored on our databases,\n\n00:04:32.958 --> 00:04:34.958\nand back them up off the planet,\n\n00:04:34.958 --> 00:04:38.958\nin case there would be one of those disastrous situations.\n\n00:04:38.958 --> 00:04:43.958\nThe difficulty is getting there, and clearly, the cost to orbit is key.\n\n00:04:43.958 --> 00:04:46.958\nOnce you're in orbit, you are two thirds of the way, energetically, to anywhere --\n\n00:04:46.958 --> 00:04:49.958\nthe moon, to Mars. And today,\n\n00:04:49.958 --> 00:04:53.958\nthere's only three vehicles -- the U.S. shuttle, the Russian Soyuz\n\n00:04:53.958 --> 00:04:55.958\nand the Chinese vehicle -- that gets you there.\n\n00:04:55.958 --> 00:05:00.958\nArguably, it's about 100 million dollars a person on the space shuttle.\n\n00:05:00.958 --> 00:05:03.958\nOne of the companies I started, Space Adventures, will sell you a ticket.\n\n00:05:03.958 --> 00:05:07.958\nWe've done two so far. We'll be announcing two more on the Soyuz\n\n00:05:07.958 --> 00:05:10.958\nto go up to the space station for 20 million dollars.\n\n00:05:10.958 --> 00:05:14.958\nBut that's expensive and to understand what the potential is --\n\n00:05:14.958 --> 00:05:16.958\n(Laughter) --\n\n00:05:16.958 --> 00:05:19.958\nit is expensive. But people are willing to pay that!\n\n00:05:19.958 --> 00:05:22.958\nYou know, one -- we have a very unique period in time today.\n\n00:05:22.958 --> 00:05:24.958\nFor the first time ever, we have enough wealth\n\n00:05:24.958 --> 00:05:26.958\nconcentrated in the hands of few individuals\n\n00:05:26.958 --> 00:05:28.958\nand the technology accessible\n\n00:05:28.958 --> 00:05:32.958\nthat will allow us to really drive space exploration.\n\n00:05:32.958 --> 00:05:36.958\nBut how cheap could it get? I want to give you the end point.\n\n00:05:36.958 --> 00:05:38.958\nWe know -- 20 million dollars today, you can go and buy a ticket,\n\n00:05:38.958 --> 00:05:40.958\nbut how cheap could it get?\n\n00:05:40.958 --> 00:05:41.958\nLet's go back to high school physics here.\n\n00:05:41.958 --> 00:05:45.958\nIf you calculate the amount of potential energy, mgh,\n\n00:05:45.958 --> 00:05:48.958\nto take you and your spacesuit up to a couple hundred miles,\n\n00:05:48.958 --> 00:05:52.958\nand then you accelerate yourself to 17,500 miles per hour --\n\n00:05:52.958 --> 00:05:56.958\nremember, that one half MV squared -- and you figure it out.\n\n00:05:56.958 --> 00:06:00.958\nIt's about 5.7 gigajoules of energy.\n\n00:06:00.958 --> 00:06:05.958\nIf you expended that over an hour, it's about 1.6 megawatts.\n\n00:06:05.958 --> 00:06:08.958\nIf you go to one of Vijay's micro-power sources,\n\n00:06:08.958 --> 00:06:10.958\nand they sell it to you for seven cents a kilowatt hour --\n\n00:06:10.958 --> 00:06:12.958\nanybody here fast in math?\n\n00:06:12.958 --> 00:06:16.958\nHow much will it cost you and your spacesuit to go to orbit?\n\n00:06:16.958 --> 00:06:20.958\n100 bucks. That's the price-improvement curve that --\n\n00:06:20.958 --> 00:06:22.958\nwe need some breakthroughs in physics along the way,\n\n00:06:22.958 --> 00:06:25.958\nI'll grant you that.\n\n00:06:25.958 --> 00:06:26.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:06:26.958 --> 00:06:30.958\nBut guys, if history has taught us anything,\n\n00:06:30.958 --> 00:06:33.958\nit's that if you can imagine it, you will get there eventually.\n\n00:06:33.958 --> 00:06:36.958\nI have no question that the physics,\n\n00:06:36.958 --> 00:06:39.958\nthe engineering to get us down to the point\n\n00:06:39.958 --> 00:06:43.958\nwhere all of us can afford orbital space flight is around the corner.\n\n00:06:43.958 --> 00:06:48.958\nThe difficulty is that there needs to be a real marketplace to drive the investment.\n\n00:06:48.958 --> 00:06:52.958\nToday, the Boeings and the Lockheeds don't spend a dollar\n\n00:06:52.958 --> 00:06:54.958\nof their own money in R&amp;D.\n\n00:06:54.958 --> 00:06:57.958\nIt's all government research dollars, and very few of those.\n\n00:06:57.958 --> 00:06:59.958\nAnd in fact, the large corporations,\n\n00:06:59.958 --> 00:07:01.958\nthe governments, can't take the risk.\n\n00:07:01.958 --> 00:07:05.958\nSo we need what I call an exothermic economic reaction in space.\n\n00:07:05.958 --> 00:07:09.958\nToday's commercial markets worldwide, global commercial launch market?\n\n00:07:09.958 --> 00:07:12.958\n12 to 15 launches per year.\n\n00:07:12.958 --> 00:07:14.958\nNumber of commercial companies out there? 12 to 15 companies.\n\n00:07:14.958 --> 00:07:18.958\nOne per company. That's not it. There's only one marketplace,\n\n00:07:18.958 --> 00:07:21.958\nand I call them self-loading carbon payloads.\n\n00:07:21.958 --> 00:07:24.958\nThey come with their own money. They're easy to make.\n\n00:07:24.958 --> 00:07:28.958\nIt's people. The Ansari X PRIZE was my solution,\n\n00:07:28.958 --> 00:07:32.958\nreading about Lindbergh for creating the vehicles to get us there.\n\n00:07:32.958 --> 00:07:35.958\nWe offered 10 million dollars in cash for the first reusable ship,\n\n00:07:35.958 --> 00:07:37.958\ncarry three people up to 100 kilometers,\n\n00:07:37.958 --> 00:07:40.958\ncome back down, and within two weeks, make the trip again.\n\n00:07:40.958 --> 00:07:44.958\nTwenty-six teams from seven countries entered the competition,\n\n00:07:44.958 --> 00:07:47.958\nspending between one to 25 million dollars each.\n\n00:07:47.958 --> 00:07:49.958\nAnd of course, we had beautiful SpaceShipOne,\n\n00:07:49.958 --> 00:07:53.958\nwhich made those two flights and won the competition.\n\n00:07:53.958 --> 00:07:56.958\nAnd I'd like to take you there, to that morning,\n\n00:07:56.958 --> 00:07:58.958\nfor just a quick video.\n\n00:08:14.958 --> 00:08:16.958\n(Video) Pilot: Release our fire.\n\n00:08:19.958 --> 00:08:24.958\nRichard Searfoss: Good luck.\n\n00:08:24.958 --> 00:08:31.958\n(Applause)\n\n00:08:39.958 --> 00:08:47.958\nRS: We've got an altitude call of 368,000 feet.\n\n00:08:47.958 --> 00:08:48.958\n(Applause)\n\n00:08:50.958 --> 00:08:53.958\nRS: So in my official capacity as the chief judge\n\n00:08:53.958 --> 00:08:55.958\nof the Ansari X PRIZE competition,\n\n00:08:55.958 --> 00:08:57.958\nI declare that Mojave Aerospace Ventures\n\n00:08:57.958 --> 00:09:00.958\nhas indeed earned the Ansari X PRIZE.\n\n00:09:00.958 --> 00:09:02.958\n(Applause)\n\n00:09:02.958 --> 00:09:04.958\nPeter Diamandis: Probably the most difficult thing that I had to do\n\n00:09:04.958 --> 00:09:07.958\nwas raise the capital for this. It was literally impossible.\n\n00:09:07.958 --> 00:09:11.958\nWe went -- I went to 100, 200 CEOs, CMOs.\n\n00:09:11.958 --> 00:09:13.958\nNo one believed it was done. Everyone said, \"Oh, what does NASA think?\n\n00:09:13.958 --> 00:09:15.958\nWell, people are going to die,\n\n00:09:15.958 --> 00:09:17.958\nhow can you possibly going to put this forward?\"\n\n00:09:17.958 --> 00:09:20.958\nI found a visionary family, the Ansari family, and Champ Car,\n\n00:09:20.958 --> 00:09:23.958\nand raised part of the money, but not the full 10 million.\n\n00:09:23.958 --> 00:09:27.958\nAnd what I ended up doing was going out to the insurance industry\n\n00:09:27.958 --> 00:09:29.958\nand buying a hole-in-one insurance policy.\n\n00:09:29.958 --> 00:09:31.958\nSee, the insurance companies went to Boeing and Lockheed,\n\n00:09:31.958 --> 00:09:33.958\nand said, \"Are you going to compete?\" No.\n\n00:09:33.958 --> 00:09:35.958\n\"Are you going to compete?\" No. \"No one's going to win this thing.\"\n\n00:09:35.958 --> 00:09:40.958\nSo, they took a bet that no one would win by January of '05,\n\n00:09:40.958 --> 00:09:44.958\nand I took a bet that someone would win.\n\n00:09:44.958 --> 00:09:45.958\n(Applause)\n\n00:09:45.958 --> 00:09:51.958\nSo -- and the best thing is they paid off and the check didn't bounce.\n\n00:09:51.958 --> 00:09:52.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:09:52.958 --> 00:09:54.958\nWe've had a lot of accomplishments\n\n00:09:54.958 --> 00:09:56.958\nand it's been a tremendous success.\n\n00:09:56.958 --> 00:10:02.958\nOne of the things I'm most happy about is that the SpaceShipOne\n\n00:10:02.958 --> 00:10:04.958\nis going to hang in Air and Space Museum,\n\n00:10:04.958 --> 00:10:06.958\nnext to the Spirit of St. Louis and the Wright Flyer.\n\n00:10:06.958 --> 00:10:11.958\nIsn't that great? (Applause)\n\n00:10:11.958 --> 00:10:15.958\nSo a little bit about the future, steps to space, what's available for you.\n\n00:10:15.958 --> 00:10:19.958\nToday, you can go and experience weightless flights.\n\n00:10:19.958 --> 00:10:23.958\nBy '08, suborbital flights, the price tag for that, you know, on Virgin,\n\n00:10:23.958 --> 00:10:25.958\nis going to be about 200,000.\n\n00:10:25.958 --> 00:10:28.958\nThere are three or four other serious efforts that will bring the price down very rapidly,\n\n00:10:28.958 --> 00:10:32.958\nI think, to about 25,000 dollars for a suborbital flight.\n\n00:10:32.958 --> 00:10:34.958\nOrbital flights -- we can take you to the space station.\n\n00:10:34.958 --> 00:10:38.958\nAnd then I truly believe, once a group is in orbit around the Earth --\n\n00:10:38.958 --> 00:10:40.958\nI know if they don't do it, I am --\n\n00:10:40.958 --> 00:10:42.958\nwe're going to stockpile some fuel,\n\n00:10:42.958 --> 00:10:45.958\nmake a beeline for the moon and grab some real estate.\n\n00:10:45.958 --> 00:10:46.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:10:46.958 --> 00:10:49.958\nQuick moment for the designers in the audience.\n\n00:10:49.958 --> 00:10:53.958\nWe spent 11 years getting FAA approval to do zero gravity flights.\n\n00:10:53.958 --> 00:10:55.958\nHere are some fun images. Here's Burt Rutan\n\n00:10:55.958 --> 00:10:59.958\nand my good friend Greg Meronek inside a zero gravity --\n\n00:10:59.958 --> 00:11:01.958\npeople think a zero gravity room,\n\n00:11:01.958 --> 00:11:03.958\nthere's a switch on there that turns it off --\n\n00:11:03.958 --> 00:11:05.958\nbut it's actually parabolic flight of an airplane.\n\n00:11:05.958 --> 00:11:10.958\nAnd turns out 7-Up has just done a little commercial that's airing this month.\n\n00:11:10.958 --> 00:11:12.958\nIf we can get the audio up?\n\n00:11:12.958 --> 00:11:16.958\n(Video) Narrator: For a chance to win the first free ticket to space,\n\n00:11:16.958 --> 00:11:20.958\nlook for specially marked packages of Diet 7-Up.\n\n00:11:20.958 --> 00:11:22.958\nWhen you want the taste that won't weigh you down,\n\n00:11:22.958 --> 00:11:24.958\nthe only way to go is up.\n\n00:11:24.958 --> 00:11:29.958\nPD: That was filmed inside our airplane, and so, you can now do this.\n\n00:11:29.958 --> 00:11:31.958\nWe're based down in Florida.\n\n00:11:31.958 --> 00:11:33.958\nLet me talk about the other thing I'm excited about.\n\n00:11:33.958 --> 00:11:37.958\nThe future of prizes. You know, prizes are a very old idea.\n\n00:11:37.958 --> 00:11:40.958\nI had the pleasure of borrowing from the Longitude Prize\n\n00:11:40.958 --> 00:11:43.958\nand the Orteig Prize that put Lindbergh forward.\n\n00:11:43.958 --> 00:11:46.958\nAnd we have made a decision in the X PRIZE Foundation\n\n00:11:46.958 --> 00:11:50.958\nto actually carry that concept forward into other technology areas,\n\n00:11:50.958 --> 00:11:52.958\nand we just took on a new mission statement:\n\n00:11:52.958 --> 00:11:55.958\n\"to bring about radical breakthroughs in space\n\n00:11:55.958 --> 00:11:58.958\nand other technologies for the benefit of humanity.\"\n\n00:11:58.958 --> 00:12:01.958\nAnd this is something that we're very excited about.\n\n00:12:01.958 --> 00:12:04.958\nI showed this slide to Larry Page, who just joined our board.\n\n00:12:04.958 --> 00:12:06.958\nAnd you know, when you give to a nonprofit,\n\n00:12:06.958 --> 00:12:08.958\nyou might have 50 cents on the dollar.\n\n00:12:08.958 --> 00:12:11.958\nIf you have a matching grant, it's typically two or three to one.\n\n00:12:11.958 --> 00:12:16.958\nIf you put up a prize, you can get literally a 50 to one leverage on your dollars.\n\n00:12:16.958 --> 00:12:18.958\nAnd that's huge. And then he turned around and said,\n\n00:12:18.958 --> 00:12:22.958\n\"Well, if you back a prize institute that runs a 10 prize, you get 500 to one.\"\n\n00:12:22.958 --> 00:12:24.958\nI said, \"Well, that's great.\"\n\n00:12:24.958 --> 00:12:27.958\nSo, we have actually -- are looking to turn the X PRIZE\n\n00:12:27.958 --> 00:12:30.958\ninto a world-class prize institute.\n\n00:12:30.958 --> 00:12:33.958\nThis is what happens when you put up a prize,\n\n00:12:33.958 --> 00:12:37.958\nwhen you announce it and teams start to begin doing trials.\n\n00:12:37.958 --> 00:12:40.958\nYou get publicity increase, and when it's won,\n\n00:12:40.958 --> 00:12:42.958\npublicity shoots through the roof -- if it's properly managed --\n\n00:12:42.958 --> 00:12:46.958\nand that's part of the benefits to a sponsor.\n\n00:12:46.958 --> 00:12:50.958\nThen, when the prize is actually won, after it's moving,\n\n00:12:50.958 --> 00:12:54.958\nyou get societal benefits, you know, new technology, new capability.\n\n00:12:54.958 --> 00:12:56.958\nAnd the benefit to the sponsors\n\n00:12:56.958 --> 00:12:59.958\nis the sum of the publicity and societal benefits over the long term.\n\n00:12:59.958 --> 00:13:02.958\nThat's our value proposition in a prize.\n\n00:13:02.958 --> 00:13:04.958\nIf you were going to go and try to create SpaceShipOne,\n\n00:13:04.958 --> 00:13:06.958\nor any kind of a new technology,\n\n00:13:06.958 --> 00:13:09.958\nyou have to fund that from the beginning\n\n00:13:09.958 --> 00:13:12.958\nand maintain that funding with an uncertain outcome.\n\n00:13:12.958 --> 00:13:15.958\nIt may or may not happen. But if you put up a prize,\n\n00:13:15.958 --> 00:13:18.958\nthe beautiful thing is, you know, it's a very small maintenance fee,\n\n00:13:18.958 --> 00:13:20.958\nand you pay on success.\n\n00:13:20.958 --> 00:13:22.958\nOrteig didn't pay a dime out to the nine teams that went across --\n\n00:13:22.958 --> 00:13:24.958\ntried to go across the Atlantic,\n\n00:13:24.958 --> 00:13:27.958\nand we didn't pay a dime until someone won the Ansari X PRIZE.\n\n00:13:27.958 --> 00:13:29.958\nSo, prizes work great.\n\n00:13:29.958 --> 00:13:31.958\nYou know, innovators, the entrepreneurs out there,\n\n00:13:31.958 --> 00:13:33.958\nyou know that when you're going for a goal,\n\n00:13:33.958 --> 00:13:35.958\nthe first thing you have to do is believe\n\n00:13:35.958 --> 00:13:37.958\nthat you can do it yourself.\n\n00:13:37.958 --> 00:13:39.958\nThen, you've got to, you know, face potential public ridicule\n\n00:13:39.958 --> 00:13:41.958\nof -- that's a crazy idea, it'll never work.\n\n00:13:41.958 --> 00:13:44.958\nAnd then you have to convince others,\n\n00:13:44.958 --> 00:13:47.958\nso that they can, in fact, help you raise the funds,\n\n00:13:47.958 --> 00:13:50.958\nand then you've got to deal with the fact that you've got government bureaucracies\n\n00:13:50.958 --> 00:13:53.958\nand institutions that don't want you to move those things forward,\n\n00:13:53.958 --> 00:13:55.958\nand you have to deal with failures. What a prize does,\n\n00:13:55.958 --> 00:13:57.958\nwhat we've experienced a prize doing,\n\n00:13:57.958 --> 00:14:02.958\nis literally help to short-circuit or support all of these things,\n\n00:14:02.958 --> 00:14:04.958\nbecause a prize credentials the idea that this is a good idea.\n\n00:14:04.958 --> 00:14:06.958\nWell, it must be a good idea.\n\n00:14:06.958 --> 00:14:09.958\nSomeone's offering 10 million dollars to go and do this thing.\n\n00:14:09.958 --> 00:14:12.958\nAnd each of these areas was something that we found\n\n00:14:12.958 --> 00:14:17.958\nthe Ansari X PRIZE helped short-circuit these for innovation.\n\n00:14:17.958 --> 00:14:20.958\nSo, as an organization, we put together a prize discovery process\n\n00:14:20.958 --> 00:14:23.958\nof how to come up with prizes and write the rules,\n\n00:14:23.958 --> 00:14:26.958\nand we're actually looking at creating prizes\n\n00:14:26.958 --> 00:14:28.958\nin a number of different categories.\n\n00:14:28.958 --> 00:14:33.958\nWe're looking at attacking energy, environment, nanotechnology --\n\n00:14:33.958 --> 00:14:35.958\nand I'll talk about those more in a moment.\n\n00:14:35.958 --> 00:14:37.958\nAnd the way we're doing that is we're creating prize teams\n\n00:14:37.958 --> 00:14:40.958\nwithin the X PRIZE. We have a space prize team.\n\n00:14:40.958 --> 00:14:42.958\nWe're going after an orbital prize.\n\n00:14:42.958 --> 00:14:45.958\nWe are looking at a number of energy prizes.\n\n00:14:45.958 --> 00:14:47.958\nCraig Venter has just joined our board\n\n00:14:47.958 --> 00:14:49.958\nand we're doing a rapid genome sequencing prize with him,\n\n00:14:49.958 --> 00:14:51.958\nwe'll be announcing later this fall,\n\n00:14:51.958 --> 00:14:55.958\nabout -- imagine being able to sequence anybody's DNA\n\n00:14:55.958 --> 00:14:58.958\nfor under 1,000 dollars, revolutionize medicine.\n\n00:14:58.958 --> 00:15:03.958\nAnd clean water, education, medicine and even looking at social entrepreneurship.\n\n00:15:03.958 --> 00:15:06.958\nSo my final slide here is, the most critical tool\n\n00:15:06.958 --> 00:15:10.958\nfor solving humanity's grand challenges -- it isn't technology,\n\n00:15:10.958 --> 00:15:12.958\nit isn't money, it's only one thing --\n\n00:15:12.958 --> 00:15:15.958\nit's the committed, passionate human mind.\n\n00:15:15.958 --> 00:15:19.958\n(Applause)"}, {"title": "What we think we know", "duration": "748", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/jonathan_drori_on_what_we_think_we_know", "transcript": "I'm going to try and explain why it is that perhaps we don't understand as much as we think we do. I'd like to begin with four questions. This is not some sort of cultural thing for the time of year. That's an in-joke, by the way. But these four questions, actually, are ones that people who even know quite a lot about science find quite hard. And they're questions that I've asked of science television producers, of audiences of science educators \u2014 so that's science teachers \u2014 and also of seven-year-olds, and I find that the seven-year-olds do marginally better than the other audiences, which is somewhat surprising.So the first question, and you might want to write this down, either on a bit of paper, physically, or a virtual piece of paper in your head. And, for viewers at home, you can try this as well. A little seed weighs next to nothing and a tree weighs a lot, right? I think we agree on that. Where does the tree get the stuff that makes up this chair, right? Where does all this stuff come from? (Knocks)And your next question is, can you light a little torch-bulb with a battery, a bulb and one piece of wire? And would you be able to, kind of, draw a \u2014 you don't have to draw the diagram, but would you be able to draw the diagram, if you had to do it? Or would you just say, that's actually not possible?The third question is, why is it hotter in summer than in winter? I think we can probably agree that it is hotter in summer than in winter, but why? And finally, would you be able to \u2014 and you can sort of scribble it, if you like \u2014 scribble a plan diagram of the solar system, showing the shape of the planets' orbits? Would you be able to do that? And if you can, just scribble a pattern.OK. Now, children get their ideas not from teachers, as teachers often think, but actually from common sense, from experience of the world around them, from all the things that go on between them and their peers, and their carers, and their parents, and all of that. Experience. And one of the great experts in this field, of course, was, bless him, Cardinal Wolsey. Be very careful what you get into people's heads because it's virtually impossible to shift it afterwards, right? (Laughter) I'm not quite sure how he died, actually. Was he beheaded in the end, or hung? (Laughter) Now, those questions, which, of course, you've got right, and you haven't been conferring, and so on. And I \u2014 you know, normally, I would pick people out and humiliate, but maybe not in this instance.A little seed weighs a lot and, basically, all this stuff, 99 percent of this stuff, came out of the air. Now, I guarantee that about 85 percent of you, or maybe it's fewer at TED, will have said it comes out of the ground. And some people, probably two of you, will come up and argue with me afterwards, and say that actually, it comes out of the ground. Now, if that was true, we'd have trucks going round the country, filling people's gardens in with soil, it'd be a fantastic business. But, actually, we don't do that. The mass of this comes out of the air. Now, I passed all my biology exams in Britain. I passed them really well, but I still came out of school thinking that that stuff came out of the ground.Second one: can you light a little torch-bulb with a battery bulb and one piece of wire? Yes, you can, and I'll show you in a second how to do that. Now, I have some rather bad news, which is that I had a piece of video that I was about to show you, which unfortunately \u2014 the sound doesn't work in this room, so I'm going to describe to you, in true \"Monty Python\" fashion, what happens in the video. And in the video, a group of researchers go to MIT on graduation day. We chose MIT because, obviously, that's a very long way away from here, and you wouldn't mind too much, but it sort of works the same way in Britain and in the West Coast of the USA. And we asked them these questions, and we asked those questions of science graduates, and they couldn't answer them. And so, there's a whole lot of people saying, \"I'd be very surprised if you told me that this came out of the air. That's very surprising to me.\" And those are science graduates. And we intercut it with, \"We are the premier science university in the world,\" because of British-like hubris. (Laughter) And when we gave graduate engineers that question, they said it couldn't be done. And when we gave them a battery, and a piece of wire, and a bulb, and said, \"Can you do it?\" They couldn't do it. Right? And that's no different from Imperial College in London, by the way, it's not some sort of anti-American thing going on.As if. Now, the reason this matters is we pay lots and lots of money for teaching people \u2014 we might as well get it right. And there are also some societal reasons why we might want people to understand what it is that's happening in photosynthesis. For example, one half of the carbon equation is how much we emit, and the other half of the carbon equation, as I'm very conscious as a trustee of Kew, is how much things soak up, and they soak up carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere. That's what plants actually do for a living. And, for any Finnish people in the audience, this is a Finnish pun: we are, both literally and metaphorically, skating on thin ice if we don't understand that kind of thing. Now, here's how you do the battery and the bulb. It's so easy, isn't it? Of course, you all knew that. But if you haven't played with a battery and a bulb, if you've only seen a circuit diagram, you might not be able to do that, and that's one of the problems.So, why is it hotter in summer than in winter? We learn, as children, that you get closer to something that's hot, and it burns you. It's a very powerful bit of learning, and it happens pretty early on. By extension, we think to ourselves, \"Why it's hotter in summer than in winter must be because we're closer to the Sun.\" I promise you that most of you will have got that. Oh, you're all shaking your heads, but only a few of you are shaking your heads very firmly. Other ones are kind of going like this. All right. It's hotter in summer than in winter because the rays from the Sun are spread out more, right, because of the tilt of the Earth. And if you think the tilt is tilting us closer, no, it isn't. The Sun is 93 million miles away, and we're tilting like this, right? It makes no odds. In fact, in the Northern Hemisphere, we're further from the Sun in summer, as it happens, but it makes no odds, the difference.OK, now, the scribble of the diagram of the solar system. If you believe, as most of you probably do, that it's hotter in summer than in winter because we're closer to the Sun, you must have drawn an ellipse. Right? That would explain it, right? Except, in your \u2014 you're nodding \u2014 now, in your ellipse, have you thought, \"Well, what happens during the night?\" Between Australia and here, right, they've got summer and we've got winter, and what \u2014 does the Earth kind of rush towards the Sun at night, and then rush back again? I mean, it's a very strange thing going on, and we hold these two models in our head, of what's right and what isn't right, and we do that, as human beings, in all sorts of fields.So, here's Copernicus' view of what the solar system looked like as a plan. That's pretty much what you should have on your piece of paper. Right? And this is NASA's view. They're stunningly similar. I hope you notice the coincidence here. What would you do if you knew that people had this misconception, right, in their heads, of elliptical orbits caused by our experiences as children? What sort of diagram would you show them of the solar system, to show that it's not really like that? You'd show them something like this, wouldn't you? It's a plan, looking down from above. But, no, look what I found in the textbooks. That's what you show people, right? These are from textbooks, from websites, educational websites \u2014 and almost anything you pick up is like that. And the reason it's like that is because it's dead boring to have a load of concentric circles, whereas that's much more exciting, to look at something at that angle, isn't it? Right? And by doing it at that angle, if you've got that misconception in your head, then that two-dimensional representation of a three-dimensional thing will be ellipses. So you've \u2014 it's crap, isn't it really? As we say. So, these mental models \u2014 we look for evidence that reinforces our models. We do this, of course, with matters of race, and politics, and everything else, and we do it in science as well. So we look, just look \u2014 and scientists do it, constantly \u2014 we look for evidence that reinforces our models, and some folks are just all too able and willing to provide the evidence that reinforces the models.So, being I'm in the United States, I'll have a dig at the Europeans. These are examples of what I would say is bad practice in science teaching centers. These pictures are from La Villette in France and the welcome wing of the Science Museum in London. And, if you look at the, kind of the way these things are constructed, there's a lot of mediation by glass, and it's very blue, and kind of professional \u2014 in that way that, you know, Woody Allen comes up from under the sheets in that scene in \"Annie Hall,\" and said, \"God, that's so professional.\" And that you don't \u2014 there's no passion in it, and it's not hands on, right, and, you know, pun intended. Whereas good interpretation \u2014 I'll use an example from nearby \u2014 is San Francisco Exploratorium, where all the things that \u2014 the demonstrations, and so on, are made out of everyday objects that children can understand, it's very hands-on, and they can engage with, and experiment with. And I know that if the graduates at MIT and in the Imperial College in London had had the battery and the wire and the bit of stuff, and you know, been able to do it, they would have learned how it actually works, rather than thinking that they follow circuit diagrams and can't do it. So good interpretation is more about things that are bodged and stuffed and of my world, right? And things that \u2014 where there isn't an extra barrier of a piece of glass or machined titanium, and it all looks fantastic, OK? And the Exploratorium does that really, really well. And it's amateur, but amateur in the best sense, in other words, the root of the word being of love and passion.So, children are not empty vessels, OK? So, as \"Monty Python\" would have it, this is a bit Lord Privy Seal to say so, but this is \u2014 children are not empty vessels. They come with their own ideas and their own theories, and unless you work with those, then you won't be able to shift them, right? And I probably haven't shifted your ideas of how the world and universe operates, either. But this applies, equally, to matters of trying to sell new technology. For example, we are, in Britain, we're trying to do a digital switchover of the whole population into digital technology [for television]. And it's one of the difficult things is that when people have preconceptions of how it all works, it's quite difficult to shift those. So we're not empty vessels; the mental models that we have as children persist into adulthood. Poor teaching actually does more harm than good. In this country and in Britain, magnetism is understood better by children before they've been to school than afterwards, OK? Same for gravity, two concepts, so it's \u2014 which is quite humbling, as a, you know, if you're a teacher, and you look before and after, that's quite worrying. They do worse in tests afterwards, after the teaching. And we collude. We design tests, or at least in Britain, so that people pass them. Right? And governments do very well. They pat themselves on the back. OK? We collude, and actually if you \u2014 if someone had designed a test for me when I was doing my biology exams, to really understand, to see whether I'd understood more than just kind of putting starch and iodine together and seeing it go blue, and really understood that plants took their mass out of the air, then I might have done better at science. So the most important thing is to get people to articulate their models.Your homework is \u2014 you know, how does an aircraft's wing create lift? An obvious question, and you'll have an answer now in your heads. And the second question to that then is, ensure you've explained how it is that planes can fly upside down. Ah ha, right. Second question is, why is the sea blue? All right? And you've all got an idea in your head of the answer. So, why is it blue on cloudy days? Ah, see. (Laughter) I've always wanted to say that in this country. (Laughter) Finally, my plea to you is to allow yourselves, and your children, and anyone you know, to kind of fiddle with stuff, because it's by fiddling with things that you, you know, you complement your other learning. It's not a replacement, it's just part of learning that's important. Thank you very much. Now \u2014 oh, oh yeah, go on then, go on.

And, for viewers at home, you can try this as well.\n\n00:00:58.958 --> 00:01:03.958\nA little seed weighs next to nothing and a tree weighs a lot, right?\n\n00:01:03.958 --> 00:01:09.958\nI think we agree on that. Where does the tree get the stuff that makes up this chair,\n\n00:01:09.958 --> 00:01:12.958\nright? Where does all this stuff come from?\n\n00:01:12.958 --> 00:01:13.958\n(Knocks)\n\n00:01:13.958 --> 00:01:19.958\nAnd your next question is, can you light a little torch-bulb\n\n00:01:19.958 --> 00:01:24.958\nwith a battery, a bulb and one piece of wire?\n\n00:01:24.958 --> 00:01:26.958\nAnd would you be able to, kind of, draw a -- you don't have to draw\n\n00:01:26.958 --> 00:01:28.958\nthe diagram, but would you be able to draw the diagram,\n\n00:01:28.958 --> 00:01:30.958\nif you had to do it? Or would you just say,\n\n00:01:30.958 --> 00:01:33.958\nthat's actually not possible?\n\n00:01:33.958 --> 00:01:37.958\nThe third question is, why is it hotter in summer than in winter?\n\n00:01:37.958 --> 00:01:42.958\nI think we can probably agree that it is hotter in summer than in winter,\n\n00:01:42.958 --> 00:01:48.958\nbut why? And finally, would you be able to --\n\n00:01:48.958 --> 00:01:50.958\nand you can sort of scribble it, if you like --\n\n00:01:50.958 --> 00:01:53.958\nscribble a plan diagram of the solar system,\n\n00:01:53.958 --> 00:01:57.958\nshowing the shape of the planets' orbits?\n\n00:01:57.958 --> 00:01:58.958\nWould you be able to do that?\n\n00:01:58.958 --> 00:02:03.958\nAnd if you can, just scribble a pattern.\n\n00:02:03.958 --> 00:02:09.958\nOK. Now, children get their ideas not from teachers,\n\n00:02:09.958 --> 00:02:12.958\nas teachers often think, but actually from common sense,\n\n00:02:12.958 --> 00:02:14.958\nfrom experience of the world around them,\n\n00:02:14.958 --> 00:02:18.958\nfrom all the things that go on between them and their peers,\n\n00:02:18.958 --> 00:02:23.958\nand their carers, and their parents, and all of that. Experience.\n\n00:02:23.958 --> 00:02:28.958\nAnd one of the great experts in this field, of course, was, bless him,\n\n00:02:28.958 --> 00:02:32.958\nCardinal Wolsey. Be very careful what you get into people's heads\n\n00:02:32.958 --> 00:02:35.958\nbecause it's virtually impossible to shift it afterwards, right?\n\n00:02:35.958 --> 00:02:38.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:02:38.958 --> 00:02:40.958\nI'm not quite sure how he died, actually.\n\n00:02:40.958 --> 00:02:42.958\nWas he beheaded in the end, or hung?\n\n00:02:42.958 --> 00:02:43.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:02:43.958 --> 00:02:45.958\nNow, those questions, which, of course, you've got right,\n\n00:02:45.958 --> 00:02:47.958\nand you haven't been conferring, and so on.\n\n00:02:47.958 --> 00:02:50.958\nAnd I -- you know, normally, I would pick people out and humiliate,\n\n00:02:50.958 --> 00:02:52.958\nbut maybe not in this instance.\n\n00:02:52.958 --> 00:02:56.958\nA little seed weighs a lot and, basically, all this stuff,\n\n00:02:56.958 --> 00:02:59.958\n99 percent of this stuff, came out of the air.\n\n00:02:59.958 --> 00:03:03.958\nNow, I guarantee that about 85 percent of you, or maybe it's fewer at TED,\n\n00:03:03.958 --> 00:03:06.958\nwill have said it comes out of the ground. And some people,\n\n00:03:06.958 --> 00:03:09.958\nprobably two of you, will come up and argue with me afterwards,\n\n00:03:09.958 --> 00:03:11.958\nand say that actually, it comes out of the ground.\n\n00:03:11.958 --> 00:03:13.958\nNow, if that was true, we'd have trucks going round the country,\n\n00:03:13.958 --> 00:03:16.958\nfilling people's gardens in with soil, it'd be a fantastic business.\n\n00:03:16.958 --> 00:03:18.958\nBut, actually, we don't do that.\n\n00:03:18.958 --> 00:03:21.958\nThe mass of this comes out of the air.\n\n00:03:21.958 --> 00:03:25.958\nNow, I passed all my biology exams in Britain.\n\n00:03:25.958 --> 00:03:27.958\nI passed them really well, but I still came out of school\n\n00:03:27.958 --> 00:03:30.958\nthinking that that stuff came out of the ground.\n\n00:03:30.958 --> 00:03:34.958\nSecond one: can you light a little torch-bulb with a battery bulb and one piece of wire?\n\n00:03:34.958 --> 00:03:36.958\nYes, you can, and I'll show you in a second how to do that.\n\n00:03:36.958 --> 00:03:38.958\nNow, I have some rather bad news,\n\n00:03:38.958 --> 00:03:41.958\nwhich is that I had a piece of video that I was about to show you,\n\n00:03:41.958 --> 00:03:44.958\nwhich unfortunately -- the sound doesn't work in this room,\n\n00:03:44.958 --> 00:03:47.958\nso I'm going to describe to you, in true \"Monty Python\" fashion,\n\n00:03:47.958 --> 00:03:52.958\nwhat happens in the video. And in the video, a group of researchers\n\n00:03:52.958 --> 00:03:54.958\ngo to MIT on graduation day.\n\n00:03:54.958 --> 00:03:57.958\nWe chose MIT because, obviously, that's a very long way away\n\n00:03:57.958 --> 00:03:59.958\nfrom here, and you wouldn't mind too much,\n\n00:03:59.958 --> 00:04:02.958\nbut it sort of works the same way in Britain\n\n00:04:02.958 --> 00:04:04.958\nand in the West Coast of the USA.\n\n00:04:04.958 --> 00:04:08.958\nAnd we asked them these questions, and we asked those questions\n\n00:04:08.958 --> 00:04:10.958\nof science graduates, and they couldn't answer them.\n\n00:04:10.958 --> 00:04:12.958\nAnd so, there's a whole lot of people saying,\n\n00:04:12.958 --> 00:04:14.958\n\"I'd be very surprised if you told me that this came out of the air.\n\n00:04:14.958 --> 00:04:18.958\nThat's very surprising to me.\" And those are science graduates.\n\n00:04:18.958 --> 00:04:21.958\nAnd we intercut it with, \"We are the premier science university in the world,\"\n\n00:04:21.958 --> 00:04:23.958\nbecause of British-like hubris.\n\n00:04:23.958 --> 00:04:24.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:04:24.958 --> 00:04:27.958\nAnd when we gave graduate engineers that question,\n\n00:04:27.958 --> 00:04:29.958\nthey said it couldn't be done.\n\n00:04:29.958 --> 00:04:33.958\nAnd when we gave them a battery, and a piece of wire, and a bulb,\n\n00:04:33.958 --> 00:04:37.958\nand said, \"Can you do it?\" They couldn't do it. Right?\n\n00:04:37.958 --> 00:04:40.958\nAnd that's no different from Imperial College in London, by the way,\n\n00:04:40.958 --> 00:04:44.958\nit's not some sort of anti-American thing going on.\n\n00:04:44.958 --> 00:04:50.958\nAs if. Now, the reason this matters is we pay lots and lots of money\n\n00:04:50.958 --> 00:04:52.958\nfor teaching people -- we might as well get it right.\n\n00:04:52.958 --> 00:04:54.958\nAnd there are also some societal reasons\n\n00:04:54.958 --> 00:04:58.958\nwhy we might want people to understand what it is that's happening\n\n00:04:58.958 --> 00:05:01.958\nin photosynthesis. For example, one half of the carbon equation\n\n00:05:01.958 --> 00:05:04.958\nis how much we emit, and the other half of the carbon equation,\n\n00:05:04.958 --> 00:05:06.958\nas I'm very conscious as a trustee of Kew,\n\n00:05:06.958 --> 00:05:11.958\nis how much things soak up, and they soak up carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere.\n\n00:05:11.958 --> 00:05:14.958\nThat's what plants actually do for a living.\n\n00:05:14.958 --> 00:05:17.958\nAnd, for any Finnish people in the audience, this is a Finnish pun:\n\n00:05:17.958 --> 00:05:22.958\nwe are, both literally and metaphorically, skating on thin ice\n\n00:05:22.958 --> 00:05:25.958\nif we don't understand that kind of thing.\n\n00:05:25.958 --> 00:05:27.958\nNow, here's how you do the battery and the bulb.\n\n00:05:27.958 --> 00:05:31.958\nIt's so easy, isn't it? Of course, you all knew that.\n\n00:05:31.958 --> 00:05:33.958\nBut if you haven't played with a battery and a bulb,\n\n00:05:33.958 --> 00:05:35.958\nif you've only seen a circuit diagram,\n\n00:05:35.958 --> 00:05:39.958\nyou might not be able to do that, and that's one of the problems.\n\n00:05:39.958 --> 00:05:41.958\nSo, why is it hotter in summer than in winter?\n\n00:05:41.958 --> 00:05:44.958\nWe learn, as children, that you get closer to something that's hot,\n\n00:05:44.958 --> 00:05:47.958\nand it burns you. It's a very powerful bit of learning,\n\n00:05:47.958 --> 00:05:49.958\nand it happens pretty early on.\n\n00:05:49.958 --> 00:05:52.958\nBy extension, we think to ourselves, \"Why it's hotter in summer than in winter\n\n00:05:52.958 --> 00:05:55.958\nmust be because we're closer to the Sun.\"\n\n00:05:55.958 --> 00:05:57.958\nI promise you that most of you will have got that.\n\n00:05:57.958 --> 00:05:58.958\nOh, you're all shaking your heads,\n\n00:05:58.958 --> 00:06:01.958\nbut only a few of you are shaking your heads very firmly.\n\n00:06:01.958 --> 00:06:03.958\nOther ones are kind of going like this. All right.\n\n00:06:03.958 --> 00:06:06.958\nIt's hotter in summer than in winter because the rays from the Sun\n\n00:06:06.958 --> 00:06:10.958\nare spread out more, right, because of the tilt of the Earth.\n\n00:06:10.958 --> 00:06:13.958\nAnd if you think the tilt is tilting us closer, no, it isn't.\n\n00:06:13.958 --> 00:06:17.958\nThe Sun is 93 million miles away, and we're tilting like this, right?\n\n00:06:17.958 --> 00:06:20.958\nIt makes no odds. In fact, in the Northern Hemisphere,\n\n00:06:20.958 --> 00:06:23.958\nwe're further from the Sun in summer,\n\n00:06:23.958 --> 00:06:26.958\nas it happens, but it makes no odds, the difference.\n\n00:06:26.958 --> 00:06:29.958\nOK, now, the scribble of the diagram of the solar system.\n\n00:06:29.958 --> 00:06:31.958\nIf you believe, as most of you probably do,\n\n00:06:31.958 --> 00:06:33.958\nthat it's hotter in summer than in winter because we're closer to the Sun,\n\n00:06:33.958 --> 00:06:35.958\nyou must have drawn an ellipse.\n\n00:06:35.958 --> 00:06:37.958\nRight? That would explain it, right?\n\n00:06:37.958 --> 00:06:41.958\nExcept, in your -- you're nodding -- now, in your ellipse,\n\n00:06:41.958 --> 00:06:43.958\nhave you thought, \"Well, what happens during the night?\"\n\n00:06:43.958 --> 00:06:47.958\nBetween Australia and here, right, they've got summer\n\n00:06:47.958 --> 00:06:50.958\nand we've got winter, and what --\n\n00:06:50.958 --> 00:06:53.958\ndoes the Earth kind of rush towards the Sun at night,\n\n00:06:53.958 --> 00:06:56.958\nand then rush back again? I mean, it's a very strange thing going on,\n\n00:06:56.958 --> 00:07:00.958\nand we hold these two models in our head, of what's right and what isn't right,\n\n00:07:00.958 --> 00:07:04.958\nand we do that, as human beings, in all sorts of fields.\n\n00:07:04.958 --> 00:07:09.958\nSo, here's Copernicus' view of what the solar system looked like as a plan.\n\n00:07:09.958 --> 00:07:12.958\nThat's pretty much what you should have on your piece of paper. Right?\n\n00:07:12.958 --> 00:07:15.958\nAnd this is NASA's view. They're stunningly similar.\n\n00:07:15.958 --> 00:07:18.958\nI hope you notice the coincidence here.\n\n00:07:18.958 --> 00:07:22.958\nWhat would you do if you knew that people had this misconception,\n\n00:07:22.958 --> 00:07:25.958\nright, in their heads, of elliptical orbits\n\n00:07:25.958 --> 00:07:27.958\ncaused by our experiences as children?\n\n00:07:27.958 --> 00:07:29.958\nWhat sort of diagram would you show them of the solar system,\n\n00:07:29.958 --> 00:07:31.958\nto show that it's not really like that?\n\n00:07:31.958 --> 00:07:33.958\nYou'd show them something like this, wouldn't you?\n\n00:07:33.958 --> 00:07:34.958\nIt's a plan, looking down from above.\n\n00:07:34.958 --> 00:07:37.958\nBut, no, look what I found in the textbooks.\n\n00:07:37.958 --> 00:07:40.958\nThat's what you show people, right? These are from textbooks,\n\n00:07:40.958 --> 00:07:42.958\nfrom websites, educational websites --\n\n00:07:42.958 --> 00:07:44.958\nand almost anything you pick up is like that.\n\n00:07:44.958 --> 00:07:46.958\nAnd the reason it's like that is because it's dead boring\n\n00:07:46.958 --> 00:07:48.958\nto have a load of concentric circles,\n\n00:07:48.958 --> 00:07:51.958\nwhereas that's much more exciting, to look at something at that angle,\n\n00:07:51.958 --> 00:07:54.958\nisn't it? Right? And by doing it at that angle,\n\n00:07:54.958 --> 00:07:56.958\nif you've got that misconception in your head, then that\n\n00:07:56.958 --> 00:08:01.958\ntwo-dimensional representation of a three-dimensional thing will be ellipses.\n\n00:08:01.958 --> 00:08:05.958\nSo you've -- it's crap, isn't it really? As we say.\n\n00:08:05.958 --> 00:08:08.958\nSo, these mental models -- we look for evidence that reinforces our models.\n\n00:08:08.958 --> 00:08:12.958\nWe do this, of course, with matters of race, and politics, and everything else,\n\n00:08:12.958 --> 00:08:14.958\nand we do it in science as well. So we look, just look --\n\n00:08:14.958 --> 00:08:17.958\nand scientists do it, constantly -- we look for evidence\n\n00:08:17.958 --> 00:08:20.958\nthat reinforces our models, and some folks are just all too able\n\n00:08:20.958 --> 00:08:23.958\nand willing to provide the evidence that reinforces the models.\n\n00:08:23.958 --> 00:08:27.958\nSo, being I'm in the United States, I'll have a dig at the Europeans.\n\n00:08:27.958 --> 00:08:30.958\nThese are examples of what I would say is bad practice in science\n\n00:08:30.958 --> 00:08:33.958\nteaching centers. These pictures are from La Villette in France\n\n00:08:33.958 --> 00:08:37.958\nand the welcome wing of the Science Museum in London.\n\n00:08:37.958 --> 00:08:41.958\nAnd, if you look at the, kind of the way these things are constructed,\n\n00:08:41.958 --> 00:08:46.958\nthere's a lot of mediation by glass, and it's very blue, and kind of professional --\n\n00:08:46.958 --> 00:08:49.958\nin that way that, you know, Woody Allen comes up\n\n00:08:49.958 --> 00:08:51.958\nfrom under the sheets in that scene in \"Annie Hall,\"\n\n00:08:51.958 --> 00:08:54.958\nand said, \"God, that's so professional.\" And that you don't --\n\n00:08:54.958 --> 00:08:57.958\nthere's no passion in it, and it's not hands on, right,\n\n00:08:57.958 --> 00:09:00.958\nand, you know, pun intended. Whereas good interpretation --\n\n00:09:00.958 --> 00:09:04.958\nI'll use an example from nearby -- is San Francisco Exploratorium,\n\n00:09:04.958 --> 00:09:07.958\nwhere all the things that -- the demonstrations, and so on,\n\n00:09:07.958 --> 00:09:10.958\nare made out of everyday objects that children can understand,\n\n00:09:10.958 --> 00:09:13.958\nit's very hands-on, and they can engage with, and experiment with.\n\n00:09:13.958 --> 00:09:15.958\nAnd I know that if the graduates at MIT\n\n00:09:15.958 --> 00:09:19.958\nand in the Imperial College in London had had the battery and the wire\n\n00:09:19.958 --> 00:09:22.958\nand the bit of stuff, and you know, been able to do it,\n\n00:09:22.958 --> 00:09:25.958\nthey would have learned how it actually works,\n\n00:09:25.958 --> 00:09:29.958\nrather than thinking that they follow circuit diagrams and can't do it.\n\n00:09:29.958 --> 00:09:31.958\nSo good interpretation is more about\n\n00:09:31.958 --> 00:09:35.958\nthings that are bodged and stuffed and of my world, right?\n\n00:09:35.958 --> 00:09:37.958\nAnd things that -- where there isn't an extra barrier\n\n00:09:37.958 --> 00:09:40.958\nof a piece of glass or machined titanium,\n\n00:09:40.958 --> 00:09:42.958\nand it all looks fantastic, OK?\n\n00:09:42.958 --> 00:09:45.958\nAnd the Exploratorium does that really, really well.\n\n00:09:45.958 --> 00:09:48.958\nAnd it's amateur, but amateur in the best sense,\n\n00:09:48.958 --> 00:09:53.958\nin other words, the root of the word being of love and passion.\n\n00:09:53.958 --> 00:09:55.958\nSo, children are not empty vessels, OK?\n\n00:09:55.958 --> 00:09:57.958\nSo, as \"Monty Python\" would have it,\n\n00:09:57.958 --> 00:09:59.958\nthis is a bit Lord Privy Seal to say so,\n\n00:09:59.958 --> 00:10:01.958\nbut this is -- children are not empty vessels.\n\n00:10:01.958 --> 00:10:03.958\nThey come with their own ideas and their own theories,\n\n00:10:03.958 --> 00:10:07.958\nand unless you work with those, then you won't be able to shift them,\n\n00:10:07.958 --> 00:10:09.958\nright? And I probably haven't shifted your ideas\n\n00:10:09.958 --> 00:10:12.958\nof how the world and universe operates, either.\n\n00:10:12.958 --> 00:10:15.958\nBut this applies, equally, to matters of trying to sell new technology.\n\n00:10:15.958 --> 00:10:18.958\nFor example, we are, in Britain, we're trying to do a digital switchover\n\n00:10:18.958 --> 00:10:20.958\nof the whole population into digital technology [for television].\n\n00:10:20.958 --> 00:10:22.958\nAnd it's one of the difficult things\n\n00:10:22.958 --> 00:10:24.958\nis that when people have preconceptions of how it all works,\n\n00:10:24.958 --> 00:10:27.958\nit's quite difficult to shift those.\n\n00:10:27.958 --> 00:10:31.958\nSo we're not empty vessels; the mental models that we have\n\n00:10:31.958 --> 00:10:33.958\nas children persist into adulthood.\n\n00:10:33.958 --> 00:10:35.958\nPoor teaching actually does more harm than good.\n\n00:10:35.958 --> 00:10:39.958\nIn this country and in Britain, magnetism is understood better\n\n00:10:39.958 --> 00:10:42.958\nby children before they've been to school than afterwards, OK?\n\n00:10:42.958 --> 00:10:46.958\nSame for gravity, two concepts, so it's -- which is quite humbling,\n\n00:10:46.958 --> 00:10:49.958\nas a, you know, if you're a teacher, and you look before and after,\n\n00:10:49.958 --> 00:10:53.958\nthat's quite worrying. They do worse in tests afterwards, after the teaching.\n\n00:10:53.958 --> 00:10:55.958\nAnd we collude. We design tests,\n\n00:10:55.958 --> 00:10:58.958\nor at least in Britain, so that people pass them. Right?\n\n00:10:58.958 --> 00:11:01.958\nAnd governments do very well. They pat themselves on the back.\n\n00:11:01.958 --> 00:11:05.958\nOK? We collude, and actually if you --\n\n00:11:05.958 --> 00:11:07.958\nif someone had designed a test for me\n\n00:11:07.958 --> 00:11:09.958\nwhen I was doing my biology exams,\n\n00:11:09.958 --> 00:11:11.958\nto really understand, to see whether I'd understood\n\n00:11:11.958 --> 00:11:13.958\nmore than just kind of putting starch and iodine together\n\n00:11:13.958 --> 00:11:15.958\nand seeing it go blue,\n\n00:11:15.958 --> 00:11:18.958\nand really understood that plants took their mass out of the air,\n\n00:11:18.958 --> 00:11:23.958\nthen I might have done better at science.\n\n00:11:23.958 --> 00:11:28.958\nSo the most important thing is to get people to articulate their models.\n\n00:11:28.958 --> 00:11:33.958\nYour homework is -- you know, how does an aircraft's wing create lift?\n\n00:11:33.958 --> 00:11:37.958\nAn obvious question, and you'll have an answer now in your heads.\n\n00:11:37.958 --> 00:11:40.958\nAnd the second question to that then is,\n\n00:11:40.958 --> 00:11:44.958\nensure you've explained how it is that planes can fly upside down.\n\n00:11:44.958 --> 00:11:48.958\nAh ha, right. Second question is, why is the sea blue? All right?\n\n00:11:48.958 --> 00:11:52.958\nAnd you've all got an idea in your head of the answer.\n\n00:11:52.958 --> 00:11:56.958\nSo, why is it blue on cloudy days? Ah, see.\n\n00:11:56.958 --> 00:11:59.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:11:59.958 --> 00:12:01.958\nI've always wanted to say that in this country.\n\n00:12:01.958 --> 00:12:03.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:12:03.958 --> 00:12:07.958\nFinally, my plea to you is to allow yourselves, and your children,\n\n00:12:07.958 --> 00:12:10.958\nand anyone you know, to kind of fiddle with stuff,\n\n00:12:10.958 --> 00:12:12.958\nbecause it's by fiddling with things that you, you know,\n\n00:12:12.958 --> 00:12:14.958\nyou complement your other learning. It's not a replacement,\n\n00:12:14.958 --> 00:12:17.958\nit's just part of learning that's important.\n\n00:12:17.958 --> 00:12:18.958\nThank you very much.\n\n00:12:18.958 --> 00:12:20.958\nNow -- oh, oh yeah, go on then, go on.\n\n00:12:21.958 --> 00:12:22.958\n(Applause)"}, {"title": "How humans and animals can live together", "duration": "1426", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/jane_goodall_at_tedglobal_07", "transcript": "Good afternoon, good evening, whatever. We can go, jambo, guten Abend, bonsoir, but we can also ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh. That is the call that chimpanzees make before they go to sleep in the evening. You hear it going from one side of the valley to the other, from one group of nests to the next.And I want to pick up with my talk this evening from where Zeray left off yesterday. He was talking about this amazing, three-year-old Australopithecine child, Selam. And we've also been hearing about the history, the family tree, of mankind through DNA genetic profiling. And it was a paleontologist, the late Louis Leakey, who actually set me on the path for studying chimpanzees. And it was pretty extraordinary, way back then. It's kind of commonplace now, but his argument was \u2014 because he'd been searching for the fossilized remains of early humans in Africa. And you can tell an awful lot about what those beings looked like from the fossils, from the shape of the muscle attachments, something about the way they lived from the various artifacts found with them. But what about how they behaved? That's what he wanted to know. And of course, behavior doesn't fossilize. He argued \u2014 and it's now a fairly common theory \u2014 that if we found behavior patterns similar or the same in our closest living relatives, the great apes, and humans today, then maybe those behaviors were present in the ape-like, human-like ancestor some seven million years ago. And therefore, perhaps we had brought those characteristics with us from that ancient, ancient past.Well, if you look in textbooks today that deal with human evolution, you very often find people speculating about how early humans may have behaved, based on the behavior of chimpanzees. They are more like us than any other living creature, and we've heard about that during this TED Conference. So it remains for me to comment on the ways in which chimpanzees are so like us, in certain aspects of their behavior.Every chimpanzee has his or her own personality. Of course, I gave them names. They can live to be 60 years or more, although we think most of them probably don't make it to 60 in the wild. Mr. Wurzel. The female has her first baby when she's 11 or 12. Thereafter, she has one baby only every five or six years, a long period of childhood dependency when the child is nursing, sleeping with the mother at night, and riding on her back. And we believe that this long period of childhood is important for chimpanzees, just as it is for us, in relation to learning. As the brain becomes ever more complex during evolution in different forms of animals, so we find that learning plays an ever more important role in an individual's life history. And young chimpanzees spend a lot of time watching what their elders do. We know now that they're capable of imitating behaviors that they see. And we believe that it's in this way that the different tool-using behaviors \u2014 that have now been seen in all the different chimpanzee populations studied in Africa \u2014 how these are passed from one generation to the next, through observation, imitation and practice, so that we can describe these tool-using behaviors as primitive culture.Chimpanzees don't have a spoken language. We've talked about that. They do have a very rich repertoire of postures and gestures, many of which are similar, or even identical, to ours and formed in the same context. Greeting chimpanzees embracing. They also kiss, hold hands, pat one another on the back. And they swagger and they throw rocks. In chimpanzee society, we find many, many examples of compassion, precursors to love and true altruism. Unfortunately, they, like us, have a dark side to their nature. They're capable of extreme brutality, even a kind of primitive war. And these really aggressive behaviors, for the most part, are directed against individuals of the neighboring social group. They are very territorially aggressive. Chimpanzees, I believe, more than any other living creature, have helped us to understand that, after all, there is no sharp line between humans and the rest of the animal kingdom.It's a very blurry line, and it's getting more blurry all the time as we make even more observations. The study that I began in 1960 is still continuing to this day. And these chimpanzees, living their complex social lives in the wild, have helped \u2014 more than anything else \u2014 to make us realize we are part of, and not separated from, the amazing animals with whom we share the planet. So it's pretty sad to find that chimpanzees, like so many other creatures around the world, are losing their habitats. This is just one photograph from the air, and it shows you the forested highlands of Gombe. And it was when I flew over the whole area, about 16 years ago, and realized that outside the park, this forest, which in 1960 had stretched almost unbroken along the eastern shore of Lake Tanganyika, which is where the tiny, 30-square-mile Gombe National Park lies, that a question came to my mind. \"How can we even try to save these famous chimpanzees, when the people living around the National Park are struggling to survive?\" More people are living there than the land could possibly support. The numbers increased by refugees pouring in from Burundi and over the lake from Congo. And very poor people \u2014 they couldn't afford to buy food from elsewhere.This led to a program, which we call TACARE. It's a very holistic way of improving the lives of the people living in the villages around the park. It started small with 12 villages. It's now in 24. There isn't time to go into it, but it's including things like tree nurseries, methods of farming most suitable to this now very degraded, almost desert-like land up in these mountains. Ways of controlling, preventing soil erosion. Ways of reclaiming overused farmland, so that within two years they can again be productive. Working to help the villagers obtain fresh water from wells. Perhaps build some schoolrooms. Most important of all, I believe, is working with small groups of women, providing them with opportunities for micro-credit loans. And we've got, as is the case around the world, about 95 percent of all loans returned. Empowering women, working with education, providing scholarships for girls so they can finish secondary school, in the clear understanding that, all around the world, as women's education improves, family size drops. We provide information about family planning and about HIV/AIDS.And as a result of this program, something's happening for conservation. What's happening for conservation is that the farmers living in these 24 villages, instead of looking on us as a bunch of white people coming to study a whole bunch of monkeys \u2014 and by the way, many of the staff are now Tanzanian \u2014 but when we began the TACARE program, it was a Tanzanian team going into the villages. It was a Tanzanian team talking to the villagers, asking what they were interested in. Were they interested in conservation? Absolutely not. They were interested in health; they were interested in education. And as time went on, and as their situation began to improve, they began to understand ever more about the need for conservation. They began to understand that as the upper levels of the hills were denuded of trees, so you've got this terrible soil erosion and mudslides.Today, we are developing what we call the Greater Gombe Ecosystem. This is an area way outside the National Park, stretching out into all these very degraded lands. And as these villages have a better standard of life, they are actually agreeing to put between 10 percent and 20 percent of their land in the highlands aside, so that once again, as the trees grow back, the chimpanzees will have leafy corridors through which they can travel to interact \u2014 as they must for genetic viability \u2014 with other remnant groups outside the National Park. So TACARE is a success. We're replicating it in other parts of Africa, around other wilderness areas which are faced with extreme population pressure.The problems in Africa, however, as we've been discussing for the whole of these first couple of days of TED, are major problems. There is a great deal of poverty. And when you get large numbers of people living in land that is not that fertile, particularly when you cut down trees, and you leave the soil open to the wind for erosion, as desperate populations cut down more and more trees, so that they can try and grow food for themselves and their families, what's going to happen? Something's got to give. And the other problems \u2014 in not only Africa, but the rest of the developing world and, indeed, everywhere \u2014 what are we doing to our planet? You know, the famous scientist, E. O. Wilson said that if every person on this planet attains the standard of living of the average European or American, we need three new planets. Today, they are saying four. But we don't have them. We've got one.And what's happened? I mean, the question here is, here we are, arguably the most intelligent being that's ever walked planet Earth, with this extraordinary brain, capable of the kind of technology that is so well illustrated by these TED Conferences, and yet we're destroying the only home we have. The indigenous people around the world, before they made a major decision, used to sit around and ask themselves, \"How does this decision affect our people seven generations ahead?\" Today, major decisions \u2014 and I'm not particularly talking about Africa here, but the developed world \u2014 major decisions involving millions of dollars, and millions of people, are often based on, \"How will this affect the next shareholders' meeting?\" And these decisions affect Africa.As I began traveling around Africa talking about the problems faced by chimpanzees and their vanishing forests, I realized more and more how so many of Africa's problems could be laid at the door of previous colonial exploitation. So I began traveling outside Africa, talking in Europe, talking in the United States, going to Asia. And everywhere there were these terrible problems. And you know the kind I'm talking about. I'm talking about pollution. The air that we breathe that often poisons us. The earth is poisoning our foods. The water \u2014 water is perhaps one of the most crucial issues that we're going to face in this century \u2014 and everywhere water is being polluted by agricultural, industrial and household chemicals that still are being sprayed around the world, seemingly with the inability to profit from past experience. The mangroves are being cut down; the effects of things like the tsunami get worse. We've talked about the soil erosion. We have the reckless burning of fossil fuels along with other greenhouse gasses, so called, leading to climate change. Finally, all around the world, people have begun to believe that there is something going on very wrong with our climate.All around the world climates are mixed up. And it's the poor people who are affected worse. It's Africa that already is affected. In many parts of sub-Saharan Africa, the droughts are so much worse. And when the rain does come, it so often leads to flooding and added distress, and the cycle of poverty and hunger and disease. And the numbers of people living in an area that the land cannot support, who are too poor to buy food, who can't move away because the whole land is degraded. And so you get desertification \u2014 creeping, creeping, creeping \u2014 as the last of the trees are cut down. And this kind of thing is not just in Africa. It's all over the world.So it wasn't surprising to me that as I was traveling around the world I met so many young people who seemed to have lost hope. We seem to have lost wisdom, the wisdom of the indigenous people. I asked a question. \"Why?\" Well, do you think there could be some kind of disconnect between this extraordinarily clever brain, the kind of brain that the TED technologies exemplify, and the human heart? Talking about it in the non-scientific term, in terms of love and compassion. Is there some disconnect? And these young people, when I talk to them, basically they were either depressed or apathetic, or bitter and angry. And they said more or less the same thing, \"We feel this way because we feel you've compromised our future and there's nothing we can do about it.\"We have compromised their future. I've got three little grandchildren, and every time I look at them and I think how we've harmed this beautiful planet since I was their age, I feel this desperation. And that led to this program we call Roots and Shoots, which began right here in Tanzania and has now spread to 97 countries around the world. It's symbolic. Roots make a firm foundation. Shoots seem tiny; to reach the sun they can break through a brick wall. See the brick wall as all these problems we've inflicted on the planet, environmental and social. It's a message of hope. Hundreds and thousands of young people around the world can break through and can make this a better world for all living things. The most important message of Roots and Shoots: every single one of us makes a difference, every single day. We have a choice. Every one of us in this room, we have a choice as to what kind of difference we want to make. The very poor have no choice. It's up to us to change things so that the poor have choice as well.The Roots and Shoots groups all choose three projects. It depends on how old they are, and which country, whether they're in a city or rural, as to what kinds of projects. But basically, we have programs now from preschool right through university, with more and more adults starting their own Roots and Shoots groups. And every group chooses, between them, three different kinds of project to make this a better world, recognizing that all these different problems are interconnected and impinge on each other. So one of their projects will be to help their own human community. And then, if they're able, they may raise money to help communities in other parts of the world. One of their projects will be to help animals \u2014 not just wildlife, domestic animals as well. And one of their projects will be to help the environment that we all share. And woven throughout all of this is a message of learning to live in peace and harmony within ourselves, in our families, in our communities, between nations, between cultures, between religions and between us and the natural world. We need the natural world. We cannot go on destroying it at the rate we are. We not do have more than this one planet.Just picking one or two of the projects right here in Africa that the Roots and Shoots groups are doing, one or two projects only \u2014 in Tanzania, in Uganda, Kenya, South Africa, Congo-Brazzaville, Sierra Leone, Cameroon and other groups. And as I say, it's in 97 countries around the world. Of course, they're planting trees. They're growing organic vegetables. They're working in the refugee camps, with chickens and selling the eggs for a little amount of money, or just using them to feed their families, and feeling a sense of pride and empowerment, because they're no longer helpless and depending on others with their vegetables and their chickens. It's being used in Uganda to give some psychological help to ex-child soldiers. Doing projects like this is bringing them out of themselves. Once again, they're useful members of society. We have this program in prisons as well. So, there's no time for more Roots and Shoots now. But \u2014 oh, they're also working on HIV/AIDS. That's a very important component of Roots and Shoots, with older kids talking to younger ones. And unwanted pregnancies and things like that, which young people listen to better from other youth, rather than adults.Hope. That's the question I get asked as I'm going around the world: \"Jane, you've seen so many terrible things, you've seen your chimpanzees decrease in number from about one million, at the turn of the century, to no more than 150,000 now, and the same with so many other animals. Forests disappearing, deserts where once there was forest. Do you really have hope?\" Well, yes. You can't come to a conference like TED and not have hope, can you? And of course, there's hope. One is this amazing human brain.And I mean, think of the technologies. And I've just been so thrilled, finally, to come to people talking about compost latrines. It's one of my hobbyhorses. We just flush all this water down the lavatory, it's terrible. And then talking about renewable energy \u2014 desperately important. Do we care about the planet for our children? How many of us have children or grandchildren, nieces, nephews? Do we care about their future? And if we care about their future, we, as the elite around the world, we can do something about it. We can make choices as to how we live each day. What we buy. What we wear. And choose to make these choices with the question, how will this affect the environment around me? How will it affect the life of my child when he or she grows up? Or my grandchild, or whatever it is. So the human brain, coupled with the human heart, and we join hands around the world. And that's what TED is helping so well with, and Google who help us, and Esri are helping us with mapping in Gombe National Park. All of these technologies we can use.Now let's link them, and it's beginning to happen, isn't it? You've heard about it this afternoon. It's beginning to happen. This change, this change. To see change that we must have if we care about the future. And the next reason for hope \u2014 nature is amazingly resilient. You can take an area that's absolutely destroyed, with time and perhaps some help it can regenerate. And an example is the TACARE program. I told you, where a seemingly dead tree stump \u2014 if you stop hacking them for firewood, which you don't need to because you have wood lots, then in five years you can have a 30-foot tree. And animals, almost on the brink of extinction, can be given a second chance. That's my next book. It's inspiring. And it brings me to my last category of hope, and we've heard about this so much in the last two days: this indomitable human spirit. This determination of people, the resilience of the human spirit, So that people who you would think would be battered by poverty, or disease, or whatever, can pull themselves up out of it, sometimes with a helping hand, and take their part in society, and take their part in changing the world.And just to think of one or two people out of Africa who are just really inspiring. We could make a very long list, but obviously Nelson Mandela, emerging from 17 years of hard physical labor, 23 years of imprisonment, with this amazing ability to forgive, so that he could lead his nation out the evil regime of apartheid without a bloodbath. Ken Saro-Wiwa, in Nigeria, who took on the giant oil companies, and although people around the world tried their best, was executed. People like this are so inspirational. People like this are the role models we need for young Africans. And we need some environmental role models as well, and I've been hearing some of them today. So I'm really grateful for this opportunity to share this message again, with everyone at TED. And I hope that some of us can get together and talk about some of these things, especially the Roots and Shoots program.And just a last word on that \u2014 the young woman who's running this entire conference center, I met her today. She came up so excited, with her certificate. She was [in] Roots and Shoots. She was in the leadership in Dar es Salaam. She said it's helped her to do what she's doing. And it was very, very exciting for me to meet her and see just one example of how young people, when they are empowered, given the opportunity to take action, to make the world a better place, truly are our hope for tomorrow.

That's what he wanted to know.\n\n00:01:48.958 --> 00:01:50.958\nAnd of course, behavior doesn't fossilize.\n\n00:01:50.958 --> 00:01:53.958\nHe argued -- and it's now a fairly common theory --\n\n00:01:53.958 --> 00:02:00.958\nthat if we found behavior patterns similar or the same\n\n00:02:00.958 --> 00:02:04.958\nin our closest living relatives, the great apes, and humans today,\n\n00:02:04.958 --> 00:02:08.958\nthen maybe those behaviors were present in the ape-like,\n\n00:02:08.958 --> 00:02:12.958\nhuman-like ancestor some seven million years ago.\n\n00:02:12.958 --> 00:02:16.958\nAnd therefore, perhaps we had brought those characteristics with us\n\n00:02:16.958 --> 00:02:18.958\nfrom that ancient, ancient past.\n\n00:02:18.958 --> 00:02:24.958\nWell, if you look in textbooks today that deal with human evolution,\n\n00:02:24.958 --> 00:02:28.958\nyou very often find people speculating about how early humans\n\n00:02:28.958 --> 00:02:32.958\nmay have behaved, based on the behavior of chimpanzees.\n\n00:02:32.958 --> 00:02:36.958\nThey are more like us than any other living creature,\n\n00:02:36.958 --> 00:02:39.958\nand we've heard about that during this TED Conference.\n\n00:02:39.958 --> 00:02:44.958\nSo it remains for me to comment on the ways in which chimpanzees\n\n00:02:44.958 --> 00:02:49.958\nare so like us, in certain aspects of their behavior.\n\n00:02:50.958 --> 00:02:53.958\nEvery chimpanzee has his or her own personality.\n\n00:02:53.958 --> 00:02:57.958\nOf course, I gave them names. They can live to be 60 years or more,\n\n00:02:57.958 --> 00:03:02.958\nalthough we think most of them probably don't make it to 60 in the wild.\n\n00:03:02.958 --> 00:03:08.958\nMr. Wurzel. The female has her first baby when she's 11 or 12.\n\n00:03:08.958 --> 00:03:12.958\nThereafter, she has one baby only every five or six years,\n\n00:03:12.958 --> 00:03:17.958\na long period of childhood dependency when the child is nursing,\n\n00:03:17.958 --> 00:03:21.958\nsleeping with the mother at night, and riding on her back.\n\n00:03:21.958 --> 00:03:24.958\nAnd we believe that this long period of childhood\n\n00:03:24.958 --> 00:03:29.958\nis important for chimpanzees, just as it is for us, in relation to learning.\n\n00:03:29.958 --> 00:03:31.958\nAs the brain becomes ever more complex\n\n00:03:31.958 --> 00:03:35.958\nduring evolution in different forms of animals,\n\n00:03:35.958 --> 00:03:38.958\nso we find that learning plays an ever more important role\n\n00:03:38.958 --> 00:03:41.958\nin an individual's life history.\n\n00:03:41.958 --> 00:03:45.958\nAnd young chimpanzees spend a lot of time watching what their elders do.\n\n00:03:45.958 --> 00:03:51.958\nWe know now that they're capable of imitating behaviors that they see.\n\n00:03:51.958 --> 00:03:54.958\nAnd we believe that it's in this way\n\n00:03:54.958 --> 00:03:57.958\nthat the different tool-using behaviors -- that have now been seen\n\n00:03:57.958 --> 00:04:01.958\nin all the different chimpanzee populations studied in Africa --\n\n00:04:01.958 --> 00:04:04.958\nhow these are passed from one generation to the next,\n\n00:04:04.958 --> 00:04:07.958\nthrough observation, imitation and practice,\n\n00:04:07.958 --> 00:04:12.958\nso that we can describe these tool-using behaviors as primitive culture.\n\n00:04:12.958 --> 00:04:16.958\nChimpanzees don't have a spoken language. We've talked about that.\n\n00:04:16.958 --> 00:04:20.958\nThey do have a very rich repertoire of postures and gestures,\n\n00:04:20.958 --> 00:04:24.958\nmany of which are similar, or even identical, to ours\n\n00:04:24.958 --> 00:04:28.958\nand formed in the same context. Greeting chimpanzees embracing.\n\n00:04:28.958 --> 00:04:31.958\nThey also kiss, hold hands, pat one another on the back.\n\n00:04:31.958 --> 00:04:34.958\nAnd they swagger and they throw rocks.\n\n00:04:35.958 --> 00:04:41.958\nIn chimpanzee society, we find many, many examples of compassion,\n\n00:04:41.958 --> 00:04:44.958\nprecursors to love and true altruism.\n\n00:04:44.958 --> 00:04:48.958\nUnfortunately, they, like us, have a dark side to their nature.\n\n00:04:48.958 --> 00:04:53.958\nThey're capable of extreme brutality, even a kind of primitive war.\n\n00:04:53.958 --> 00:04:56.958\nAnd these really aggressive behaviors, for the most part,\n\n00:04:56.958 --> 00:05:00.958\nare directed against individuals of the neighboring social group.\n\n00:05:00.958 --> 00:05:04.958\nThey are very territorially aggressive.\n\n00:05:05.958 --> 00:05:09.958\nChimpanzees, I believe, more than any other living creature,\n\n00:05:09.958 --> 00:05:13.958\nhave helped us to understand that, after all, there is no sharp line\n\n00:05:13.958 --> 00:05:16.958\nbetween humans and the rest of the animal kingdom.\n\n00:05:16.958 --> 00:05:20.958\nIt's a very blurry line, and it's getting more blurry all the time\n\n00:05:20.958 --> 00:05:23.958\nas we make even more observations.\n\n00:05:23.958 --> 00:05:28.958\nThe study that I began in 1960 is still continuing to this day.\n\n00:05:28.958 --> 00:05:33.958\nAnd these chimpanzees, living their complex social lives in the wild,\n\n00:05:33.958 --> 00:05:36.958\nhave helped -- more than anything else --\n\n00:05:36.958 --> 00:05:40.958\nto make us realize we are part of, and not separated from,\n\n00:05:40.958 --> 00:05:43.958\nthe amazing animals with whom we share the planet.\n\n00:05:43.958 --> 00:05:46.958\nSo it's pretty sad to find that chimpanzees,\n\n00:05:46.958 --> 00:05:50.958\nlike so many other creatures around the world, are losing their habitats.\n\n00:05:50.958 --> 00:05:53.958\nThis is just one photograph from the air,\n\n00:05:53.958 --> 00:05:57.958\nand it shows you the forested highlands of Gombe.\n\n00:05:57.958 --> 00:06:03.958\nAnd it was when I flew over the whole area, about 16 years ago,\n\n00:06:03.958 --> 00:06:06.958\nand realized that outside the park, this forest,\n\n00:06:06.958 --> 00:06:09.958\nwhich in 1960 had stretched almost unbroken\n\n00:06:09.958 --> 00:06:12.958\nalong the eastern shore of Lake Tanganyika,\n\n00:06:12.958 --> 00:06:17.958\nwhich is where the tiny, 30-square-mile Gombe National Park lies,\n\n00:06:17.958 --> 00:06:20.958\nthat a question came to my mind.\n\n00:06:20.958 --> 00:06:24.958\n\"How can we even try to save these famous chimpanzees,\n\n00:06:24.958 --> 00:06:28.958\nwhen the people living around the National Park are struggling to survive?\"\n\n00:06:28.958 --> 00:06:32.958\nMore people are living there than the land could possibly support.\n\n00:06:32.958 --> 00:06:36.958\nThe numbers increased by refugees pouring in from Burundi\n\n00:06:36.958 --> 00:06:38.958\nand over the lake from Congo.\n\n00:06:38.958 --> 00:06:45.958\nAnd very poor people -- they couldn't afford to buy food from elsewhere.\n\n00:06:45.958 --> 00:06:48.958\nThis led to a program, which we call TACARE.\n\n00:06:48.958 --> 00:06:53.958\nIt's a very holistic way of improving the lives\n\n00:06:53.958 --> 00:06:56.958\nof the people living in the villages around the park.\n\n00:06:56.958 --> 00:07:00.958\nIt started small with 12 villages. It's now in 24.\n\n00:07:00.958 --> 00:07:05.958\nThere isn't time to go into it, but it's including things like tree nurseries,\n\n00:07:05.958 --> 00:07:09.958\nmethods of farming most suitable to this now very degraded,\n\n00:07:09.958 --> 00:07:12.958\nalmost desert-like land up in these mountains.\n\n00:07:12.958 --> 00:07:16.958\nWays of controlling, preventing soil erosion.\n\n00:07:16.958 --> 00:07:19.958\nWays of reclaiming overused farmland,\n\n00:07:19.958 --> 00:07:22.958\nso that within two years they can again be productive.\n\n00:07:22.958 --> 00:07:28.958\nWorking to help the villagers obtain fresh water from wells.\n\n00:07:28.958 --> 00:07:31.958\nPerhaps build some schoolrooms.\n\n00:07:31.958 --> 00:07:34.958\nMost important of all, I believe,\n\n00:07:34.958 --> 00:07:38.958\nis working with small groups of women,\n\n00:07:38.958 --> 00:07:42.958\nproviding them with opportunities for micro-credit loans.\n\n00:07:42.958 --> 00:07:45.958\nAnd we've got, as is the case around the world,\n\n00:07:45.958 --> 00:07:49.958\nabout 95 percent of all loans returned.\n\n00:07:49.958 --> 00:07:54.958\nEmpowering women, working with education,\n\n00:07:54.958 --> 00:08:00.958\nproviding scholarships for girls so they can finish secondary school,\n\n00:08:00.958 --> 00:08:03.958\nin the clear understanding that, all around the world,\n\n00:08:03.958 --> 00:08:08.958\nas women's education improves, family size drops.\n\n00:08:08.958 --> 00:08:13.958\nWe provide information about family planning and about HIV/AIDS.\n\n00:08:13.958 --> 00:08:17.958\nAnd as a result of this program,\n\n00:08:17.958 --> 00:08:19.958\nsomething's happening for conservation.\n\n00:08:19.958 --> 00:08:25.958\nWhat's happening for conservation is that the farmers living in these 24 villages,\n\n00:08:25.958 --> 00:08:28.958\ninstead of looking on us as a bunch of white people\n\n00:08:28.958 --> 00:08:31.958\ncoming to study a whole bunch of monkeys --\n\n00:08:31.958 --> 00:08:35.958\nand by the way, many of the staff are now Tanzanian --\n\n00:08:35.958 --> 00:08:38.958\nbut when we began the TACARE program,\n\n00:08:38.958 --> 00:08:41.958\nit was a Tanzanian team going into the villages.\n\n00:08:41.958 --> 00:08:44.958\nIt was a Tanzanian team talking to the villagers,\n\n00:08:44.958 --> 00:08:46.958\nasking what they were interested in.\n\n00:08:46.958 --> 00:08:49.958\nWere they interested in conservation? Absolutely not.\n\n00:08:49.958 --> 00:08:52.958\nThey were interested in health; they were interested in education.\n\n00:08:52.958 --> 00:08:59.958\nAnd as time went on, and as their situation began to improve,\n\n00:08:59.958 --> 00:09:04.958\nthey began to understand ever more about the need for conservation.\n\n00:09:04.958 --> 00:09:06.958\nThey began to understand\n\n00:09:06.958 --> 00:09:09.958\nthat as the upper levels of the hills were denuded of trees,\n\n00:09:09.958 --> 00:09:13.958\nso you've got this terrible soil erosion and mudslides.\n\n00:09:13.958 --> 00:09:18.958\nToday, we are developing what we call the Greater Gombe Ecosystem.\n\n00:09:18.958 --> 00:09:21.958\nThis is an area way outside the National Park,\n\n00:09:21.958 --> 00:09:25.958\nstretching out into all these very degraded lands.\n\n00:09:25.958 --> 00:09:29.958\nAnd as these villages have a better standard of life,\n\n00:09:29.958 --> 00:09:31.958\nthey are actually agreeing to put\n\n00:09:31.958 --> 00:09:36.958\nbetween 10 percent and 20 percent of their land in the highlands aside,\n\n00:09:36.958 --> 00:09:40.958\nso that once again, as the trees grow back,\n\n00:09:40.958 --> 00:09:42.958\nthe chimpanzees will have leafy corridors\n\n00:09:42.958 --> 00:09:45.958\nthrough which they can travel to interact --\n\n00:09:45.958 --> 00:09:48.958\nas they must for genetic viability --\n\n00:09:48.958 --> 00:09:51.958\nwith other remnant groups outside the National Park.\n\n00:09:51.958 --> 00:09:55.958\nSo TACARE is a success.\n\n00:09:55.958 --> 00:09:58.958\nWe're replicating it in other parts of Africa,\n\n00:09:58.958 --> 00:10:00.958\naround other wilderness areas\n\n00:10:00.958 --> 00:10:03.958\nwhich are faced with extreme population pressure.\n\n00:10:03.958 --> 00:10:08.958\nThe problems in Africa, however, as we've been discussing\n\n00:10:08.958 --> 00:10:12.958\nfor the whole of these first couple of days of TED,\n\n00:10:12.958 --> 00:10:15.958\nare major problems.\n\n00:10:15.958 --> 00:10:17.958\nThere is a great deal of poverty.\n\n00:10:17.958 --> 00:10:21.958\nAnd when you get large numbers of people\n\n00:10:21.958 --> 00:10:25.958\nliving in land that is not that fertile,\n\n00:10:25.958 --> 00:10:27.958\nparticularly when you cut down trees,\n\n00:10:27.958 --> 00:10:31.958\nand you leave the soil open to the wind for erosion,\n\n00:10:32.958 --> 00:10:35.958\nas desperate populations cut down more and more trees,\n\n00:10:35.958 --> 00:10:39.958\nso that they can try and grow food for themselves and their families,\n\n00:10:39.958 --> 00:10:42.958\nwhat's going to happen? Something's got to give.\n\n00:10:42.958 --> 00:10:48.958\nAnd the other problems -- in not only Africa,\n\n00:10:48.958 --> 00:10:52.958\nbut the rest of the developing world and, indeed, everywhere --\n\n00:10:52.958 --> 00:10:55.958\nwhat are we doing to our planet?\n\n00:10:55.958 --> 00:10:58.958\nYou know, the famous scientist, E. O. Wilson\n\n00:10:58.958 --> 00:11:01.958\nsaid that if every person on this planet\n\n00:11:01.958 --> 00:11:05.958\nattains the standard of living of the average European or American,\n\n00:11:05.958 --> 00:11:07.958\nwe need three new planets.\n\n00:11:07.958 --> 00:11:12.958\nToday, they are saying four. But we don't have them. We've got one.\n\n00:11:13.958 --> 00:11:19.958\nAnd what's happened? I mean, the question here is, here we are,\n\n00:11:19.958 --> 00:11:24.958\narguably the most intelligent being that's ever walked planet Earth,\n\n00:11:24.958 --> 00:11:26.958\nwith this extraordinary brain,\n\n00:11:26.958 --> 00:11:29.958\ncapable of the kind of technology\n\n00:11:29.958 --> 00:11:33.958\nthat is so well illustrated by these TED Conferences,\n\n00:11:33.958 --> 00:11:37.958\nand yet we're destroying the only home we have.\n\n00:11:37.958 --> 00:11:40.958\nThe indigenous people around the world,\n\n00:11:40.958 --> 00:11:42.958\nbefore they made a major decision,\n\n00:11:42.958 --> 00:11:45.958\nused to sit around and ask themselves,\n\n00:11:45.958 --> 00:11:49.958\n\"How does this decision affect our people seven generations ahead?\"\n\n00:11:49.958 --> 00:11:54.958\nToday, major decisions -- and I'm not particularly talking about Africa here,\n\n00:11:54.958 --> 00:11:56.958\nbut the developed world --\n\n00:11:56.958 --> 00:11:59.958\nmajor decisions involving millions of dollars,\n\n00:11:59.958 --> 00:12:01.958\nand millions of people, are often based on,\n\n00:12:01.958 --> 00:12:04.958\n\"How will this affect the next shareholders' meeting?\"\n\n00:12:04.958 --> 00:12:06.958\nAnd these decisions affect Africa.\n\n00:12:06.958 --> 00:12:08.958\nAs I began traveling around Africa\n\n00:12:08.958 --> 00:12:13.958\ntalking about the problems faced by chimpanzees and their vanishing forests,\n\n00:12:13.958 --> 00:12:16.958\nI realized more and more how so many of Africa's problems\n\n00:12:16.958 --> 00:12:21.958\ncould be laid at the door of previous colonial exploitation.\n\n00:12:21.958 --> 00:12:24.958\nSo I began traveling outside Africa, talking in Europe,\n\n00:12:24.958 --> 00:12:27.958\ntalking in the United States, going to Asia.\n\n00:12:27.958 --> 00:12:30.958\nAnd everywhere there were these terrible problems.\n\n00:12:30.958 --> 00:12:34.958\nAnd you know the kind I'm talking about. I'm talking about pollution.\n\n00:12:34.958 --> 00:12:37.958\nThe air that we breathe that often poisons us.\n\n00:12:37.958 --> 00:12:39.958\nThe earth is poisoning our foods.\n\n00:12:39.958 --> 00:12:43.958\nThe water -- water is perhaps one of the most crucial issues\n\n00:12:43.958 --> 00:12:46.958\nthat we're going to face in this century --\n\n00:12:46.958 --> 00:12:49.958\nand everywhere water is being polluted by agricultural,\n\n00:12:49.958 --> 00:12:52.958\nindustrial and household chemicals\n\n00:12:52.958 --> 00:12:55.958\nthat still are being sprayed around the world,\n\n00:12:55.958 --> 00:13:00.958\nseemingly with the inability to profit from past experience.\n\n00:13:00.958 --> 00:13:03.958\nThe mangroves are being cut down;\n\n00:13:03.958 --> 00:13:06.958\nthe effects of things like the tsunami get worse.\n\n00:13:06.958 --> 00:13:08.958\nWe've talked about the soil erosion.\n\n00:13:08.958 --> 00:13:12.958\nWe have the reckless burning of fossil fuels\n\n00:13:12.958 --> 00:13:15.958\nalong with other greenhouse gasses, so called,\n\n00:13:15.958 --> 00:13:17.958\nleading to climate change.\n\n00:13:17.958 --> 00:13:21.958\nFinally, all around the world, people have begun to believe\n\n00:13:21.958 --> 00:13:24.958\nthat there is something going on very wrong with our climate.\n\n00:13:24.958 --> 00:13:27.958\nAll around the world climates are mixed up.\n\n00:13:27.958 --> 00:13:30.958\nAnd it's the poor people who are affected worse.\n\n00:13:30.958 --> 00:13:33.958\nIt's Africa that already is affected.\n\n00:13:33.958 --> 00:13:37.958\nIn many parts of sub-Saharan Africa, the droughts are so much worse.\n\n00:13:37.958 --> 00:13:40.958\nAnd when the rain does come, it so often leads to flooding\n\n00:13:40.958 --> 00:13:47.958\nand added distress, and the cycle of poverty and hunger and disease.\n\n00:13:47.958 --> 00:13:53.958\nAnd the numbers of people living in an area that the land cannot support,\n\n00:13:53.958 --> 00:13:56.958\nwho are too poor to buy food,\n\n00:13:56.958 --> 00:13:59.958\nwho can't move away because the whole land is degraded.\n\n00:13:59.958 --> 00:14:05.958\nAnd so you get desertification -- creeping, creeping, creeping --\n\n00:14:05.958 --> 00:14:07.958\nas the last of the trees are cut down.\n\n00:14:07.958 --> 00:14:11.958\nAnd this kind of thing is not just in Africa. It's all over the world.\n\n00:14:13.958 --> 00:14:17.958\nSo it wasn't surprising to me\n\n00:14:17.958 --> 00:14:19.958\nthat as I was traveling around the world\n\n00:14:19.958 --> 00:14:23.958\nI met so many young people who seemed to have lost hope.\n\n00:14:23.958 --> 00:14:28.958\nWe seem to have lost wisdom, the wisdom of the indigenous people.\n\n00:14:28.958 --> 00:14:31.958\nI asked a question. \"Why?\"\n\n00:14:31.958 --> 00:14:35.958\nWell, do you think there could be some kind of disconnect\n\n00:14:35.958 --> 00:14:38.958\nbetween this extraordinarily clever brain,\n\n00:14:38.958 --> 00:14:44.958\nthe kind of brain that the TED technologies exemplify,\n\n00:14:44.958 --> 00:14:48.958\nand the human heart? Talking about it in the non-scientific term,\n\n00:14:48.958 --> 00:14:53.958\nin terms of love and compassion. Is there some disconnect?\n\n00:14:53.958 --> 00:14:57.958\nAnd these young people, when I talk to them,\n\n00:14:57.958 --> 00:15:00.958\nbasically they were either depressed or apathetic,\n\n00:15:00.958 --> 00:15:04.958\nor bitter and angry. And they said more or less the same thing,\n\n00:15:04.958 --> 00:15:07.958\n\"We feel this way because we feel you've compromised our future\n\n00:15:07.958 --> 00:15:10.958\nand there's nothing we can do about it.\"\n\n00:15:10.958 --> 00:15:12.958\nWe have compromised their future.\n\n00:15:12.958 --> 00:15:15.958\nI've got three little grandchildren, and every time I look at them\n\n00:15:15.958 --> 00:15:20.958\nand I think how we've harmed this beautiful planet since I was their age,\n\n00:15:20.958 --> 00:15:22.958\nI feel this desperation.\n\n00:15:22.958 --> 00:15:25.958\nAnd that led to this program we call Roots and Shoots,\n\n00:15:25.958 --> 00:15:28.958\nwhich began right here in Tanzania\n\n00:15:28.958 --> 00:15:32.958\nand has now spread to 97 countries around the world.\n\n00:15:32.958 --> 00:15:35.958\nIt's symbolic. Roots make a firm foundation.\n\n00:15:35.958 --> 00:15:39.958\nShoots seem tiny; to reach the sun they can break through a brick wall.\n\n00:15:39.958 --> 00:15:43.958\nSee the brick wall as all these problems we've inflicted on the planet,\n\n00:15:43.958 --> 00:15:46.958\nenvironmental and social. It's a message of hope.\n\n00:15:46.958 --> 00:15:49.958\nHundreds and thousands of young people around the world\n\n00:15:49.958 --> 00:15:54.958\ncan break through and can make this a better world for all living things.\n\n00:15:54.958 --> 00:15:57.958\nThe most important message of Roots and Shoots:\n\n00:15:57.958 --> 00:16:02.958\nevery single one of us makes a difference, every single day.\n\n00:16:02.958 --> 00:16:06.958\nWe have a choice. Every one of us in this room,\n\n00:16:06.958 --> 00:16:11.958\nwe have a choice as to what kind of difference we want to make.\n\n00:16:11.958 --> 00:16:16.958\nThe very poor have no choice. It's up to us to change things\n\n00:16:16.958 --> 00:16:19.958\nso that the poor have choice as well.\n\n00:16:19.958 --> 00:16:23.958\nThe Roots and Shoots groups all choose three projects.\n\n00:16:23.958 --> 00:16:27.958\nIt depends on how old they are, and which country,\n\n00:16:27.958 --> 00:16:31.958\nwhether they're in a city or rural, as to what kinds of projects.\n\n00:16:31.958 --> 00:16:35.958\nBut basically, we have programs now from preschool right through university,\n\n00:16:35.958 --> 00:16:41.958\nwith more and more adults starting their own Roots and Shoots groups.\n\n00:16:41.958 --> 00:16:44.958\nAnd every group chooses, between them,\n\n00:16:44.958 --> 00:16:47.958\nthree different kinds of project to make this a better world,\n\n00:16:47.958 --> 00:16:51.958\nrecognizing that all these different problems are interconnected\n\n00:16:51.958 --> 00:16:53.958\nand impinge on each other.\n\n00:16:53.958 --> 00:16:56.958\nSo one of their projects will be to help their own human community.\n\n00:16:56.958 --> 00:17:00.958\nAnd then, if they're able, they may raise money to help communities\n\n00:17:00.958 --> 00:17:02.958\nin other parts of the world.\n\n00:17:02.958 --> 00:17:06.958\nOne of their projects will be to help animals -- not just wildlife,\n\n00:17:06.958 --> 00:17:08.958\ndomestic animals as well.\n\n00:17:08.958 --> 00:17:12.958\nAnd one of their projects will be to help the environment that we all share.\n\n00:17:12.958 --> 00:17:16.958\nAnd woven throughout all of this is a message\n\n00:17:16.958 --> 00:17:21.958\nof learning to live in peace and harmony within ourselves,\n\n00:17:21.958 --> 00:17:25.958\nin our families, in our communities, between nations, between cultures,\n\n00:17:25.958 --> 00:17:29.958\nbetween religions and between us and the natural world.\n\n00:17:29.958 --> 00:17:34.958\nWe need the natural world. We cannot go on destroying it at the rate we are.\n\n00:17:34.958 --> 00:17:38.958\nWe not do have more than this one planet.\n\n00:17:38.958 --> 00:17:42.958\nJust picking one or two of the projects right here in Africa\n\n00:17:42.958 --> 00:17:45.958\nthat the Roots and Shoots groups are doing,\n\n00:17:45.958 --> 00:17:50.958\none or two projects only -- in Tanzania, in Uganda, Kenya,\n\n00:17:50.958 --> 00:17:55.958\nSouth Africa, Congo-Brazzaville, Sierra Leone, Cameroon\n\n00:17:55.958 --> 00:17:59.958\nand other groups. And as I say, it's in 97 countries around the world.\n\n00:17:59.958 --> 00:18:03.958\nOf course, they're planting trees. They're growing organic vegetables.\n\n00:18:03.958 --> 00:18:06.958\nThey're working in the refugee camps, with chickens\n\n00:18:06.958 --> 00:18:08.958\nand selling the eggs for a little amount of money,\n\n00:18:08.958 --> 00:18:11.958\nor just using them to feed their families,\n\n00:18:11.958 --> 00:18:14.958\nand feeling a sense of pride and empowerment,\n\n00:18:14.958 --> 00:18:16.958\nbecause they're no longer helpless and depending on others\n\n00:18:16.958 --> 00:18:19.958\nwith their vegetables and their chickens.\n\n00:18:19.958 --> 00:18:21.958\nIt's being used in Uganda\n\n00:18:21.958 --> 00:18:26.958\nto give some psychological help to ex-child soldiers.\n\n00:18:26.958 --> 00:18:29.958\nDoing projects like this is bringing them out of themselves.\n\n00:18:29.958 --> 00:18:32.958\nOnce again, they're useful members of society.\n\n00:18:32.958 --> 00:18:34.958\nWe have this program in prisons as well.\n\n00:18:35.958 --> 00:18:38.958\nSo, there's no time for more Roots and Shoots now.\n\n00:18:38.958 --> 00:18:42.958\nBut -- oh, they're also working on HIV/AIDS.\n\n00:18:42.958 --> 00:18:45.958\nThat's a very important component of Roots and Shoots,\n\n00:18:45.958 --> 00:18:47.958\nwith older kids talking to younger ones.\n\n00:18:47.958 --> 00:18:50.958\nAnd unwanted pregnancies and things like that,\n\n00:18:50.958 --> 00:18:55.958\nwhich young people listen to better from other youth, rather than adults.\n\n00:18:56.958 --> 00:19:01.958\nHope. That's the question I get asked as I'm going around the world:\n\n00:19:01.958 --> 00:19:03.958\n\"Jane, you've seen so many terrible things,\n\n00:19:03.958 --> 00:19:06.958\nyou've seen your chimpanzees decrease in number\n\n00:19:06.958 --> 00:19:08.958\nfrom about one million, at the turn of the century,\n\n00:19:08.958 --> 00:19:13.958\nto no more than 150,000 now, and the same with so many other animals.\n\n00:19:13.958 --> 00:19:17.958\nForests disappearing, deserts where once there was forest.\n\n00:19:17.958 --> 00:19:21.958\nDo you really have hope?\" Well, yes.\n\n00:19:21.958 --> 00:19:25.958\nYou can't come to a conference like TED and not have hope, can you?\n\n00:19:25.958 --> 00:19:29.958\nAnd of course, there's hope. One is this amazing human brain.\n\n00:19:29.958 --> 00:19:31.958\nAnd I mean, think of the technologies.\n\n00:19:31.958 --> 00:19:38.958\nAnd I've just been so thrilled, finally, to come to people talking about compost latrines.\n\n00:19:38.958 --> 00:19:40.958\nIt's one of my hobbyhorses.\n\n00:19:40.958 --> 00:19:44.958\nWe just flush all this water down the lavatory, it's terrible.\n\n00:19:44.958 --> 00:19:49.958\nAnd then talking about renewable energy -- desperately important.\n\n00:19:49.958 --> 00:19:52.958\nDo we care about the planet for our children?\n\n00:19:52.958 --> 00:19:55.958\nHow many of us have children or grandchildren, nieces, nephews?\n\n00:19:55.958 --> 00:19:58.958\nDo we care about their future?\n\n00:19:58.958 --> 00:20:03.958\nAnd if we care about their future, we, as the elite around the world,\n\n00:20:03.958 --> 00:20:07.958\nwe can do something about it. We can make choices as to how we live each day.\n\n00:20:07.958 --> 00:20:09.958\nWhat we buy. What we wear.\n\n00:20:09.958 --> 00:20:14.958\nAnd choose to make these choices with the question,\n\n00:20:14.958 --> 00:20:17.958\nhow will this affect the environment around me?\n\n00:20:17.958 --> 00:20:22.958\nHow will it affect the life of my child when he or she grows up?\n\n00:20:22.958 --> 00:20:24.958\nOr my grandchild, or whatever it is.\n\n00:20:24.958 --> 00:20:29.958\nSo the human brain, coupled with the human heart,\n\n00:20:29.958 --> 00:20:31.958\nand we join hands around the world.\n\n00:20:31.958 --> 00:20:35.958\nAnd that's what TED is helping so well with, and Google who help us,\n\n00:20:35.958 --> 00:20:40.958\nand Esri are helping us with mapping in Gombe National Park.\n\n00:20:40.958 --> 00:20:42.958\nAll of these technologies we can use.\n\n00:20:42.958 --> 00:20:45.958\nNow let's link them, and it's beginning to happen, isn't it?\n\n00:20:45.958 --> 00:20:49.958\nYou've heard about it this afternoon. It's beginning to happen.\n\n00:20:49.958 --> 00:20:51.958\nThis change, this change. To see change\n\n00:20:51.958 --> 00:20:54.958\nthat we must have if we care about the future.\n\n00:20:54.958 --> 00:20:58.958\nAnd the next reason for hope -- nature is amazingly resilient.\n\n00:20:58.958 --> 00:21:01.958\nYou can take an area that's absolutely destroyed,\n\n00:21:01.958 --> 00:21:04.958\nwith time and perhaps some help it can regenerate.\n\n00:21:04.958 --> 00:21:07.958\nAnd an example is the TACARE program.\n\n00:21:07.958 --> 00:21:10.958\nI told you, where a seemingly dead tree stump --\n\n00:21:10.958 --> 00:21:12.958\nif you stop hacking them for firewood,\n\n00:21:12.958 --> 00:21:14.958\nwhich you don't need to because you have wood lots,\n\n00:21:14.958 --> 00:21:18.958\nthen in five years you can have a 30-foot tree.\n\n00:21:18.958 --> 00:21:21.958\nAnd animals, almost on the brink of extinction,\n\n00:21:21.958 --> 00:21:24.958\ncan be given a second chance. That's my next book.\n\n00:21:24.958 --> 00:21:28.958\nIt's inspiring. And it brings me to my last category of hope,\n\n00:21:28.958 --> 00:21:31.958\nand we've heard about this so much in the last two days:\n\n00:21:31.958 --> 00:21:35.958\nthis indomitable human spirit.

Now, there's a bigger question that's probably actually more important than that, is the notion of permanently eliminating the possibility of a nuclear attack, eliminating the threat altogether. And I would like to make a case to you that over the years since we first developed atomic weaponry, until this very moment, we've actually lived in a dangerous nuclear world that's characterized by two phases, which I'm going to go through with you right now.First of all, we started off the nuclear age in 1945. The United States had developed a couple of atomic weapons through the Manhattan Project, and the idea was very straightforward: we would use the power of the atom to end the atrocities and the horror of this unending World War II that we'd been involved in in Europe and in the Pacific. And in 1945, we were the only nuclear power. We had a few nuclear weapons, two of which we dropped on Japan, in Hiroshima, a few days later in Nagasaki, in August 1945, killing about 250,000 people between those two.And for a few years, we were the only nuclear power on Earth. But by 1949, the Soviet Union had decided it was unacceptable to have us as the only nuclear power, and they began to match what the United States had developed. And from 1949 to 1985 was an extraordinary time of a buildup of a nuclear arsenal that no one could possibly have imagined back in the 1940s. So by 1985 \u2014 each of those red bombs up here is equivalent of a thousands warheads \u2014 the world had 65,000 nuclear warheads, and seven members of something that came to be known as the \"nuclear club.\"And it was an extraordinary time, and I am going to go through some of the mentality that we \u2014 that Americans and the rest of the world were experiencing. But I want to just point out to you that 95 percent of the nuclear weapons at any particular time since 1985 \u2014 going forward, of course \u2014 were part of the arsenals of the United States and the Soviet Union. After 1985, and before the break up of the Soviet Union, we began to disarm from a nuclear point of view. We began to counter-proliferate, and we dropped the number of nuclear warheads in the world to about a total of 21,000. It's a very difficult number to deal with, because what we've done is we've quote unquote \"decommissioned\" some of the warheads. They're still probably usable. They could be \"re-commissioned,\" but the way they count things, which is very complicated, we think we have about a third of the nuclear weapons we had before. But we also, in that period of time, added two more members to the nuclear club: Pakistan and North Korea.So we stand today with a still fully armed nuclear arsenal among many countries around the world, but a very different set of circumstances. So I'm going to talk about a nuclear threat story in two chapters. Chapter one is 1949 to 1991, when the Soviet Union broke up, and what we were dealing with, at that point and through those years, was a superpowers' nuclear arms race. It was characterized by a nation-versus-nation, very fragile standoff. And basically, we lived for all those years, and some might argue that we still do, in a situation of being on the brink, literally, of an apocalyptic, planetary calamity. It's incredible that we actually lived through all that.We were totally dependent during those years on this amazing acronym, which is MAD. It stands for mutually assured destruction. So it meant if you attacked us, we would attack you virtually simultaneously, and the end result would be a destruction of your country and mine. So the threat of my own destruction kept me from launching a nuclear attack on you. That's the way we lived. And the danger of that, of course, is that a misreading of a radar screen could actually cause a counter-launch, even though the first country had not actually launched anything. During this chapter one, there was a high level of public awareness about the potential of nuclear catastrophe, and an indelible image was implanted in our collective minds that, in fact, a nuclear holocaust would be absolutely globally destructive and could, in some ways, mean the end of civilization as we know it. So this was chapter one.Now the odd thing is that even though we knew that there would be that kind of civilization obliteration, we engaged in America in a series \u2014 and in fact, in the Soviet Union \u2014 in a series of response planning. It was absolutely incredible. So premise one is we'd be destroying the world, and then premise two is, why don't we get prepared for it? So what we offered ourselves was a collection of things. I'm just going to go skim through a few things, just to jog your memories. If you're born after 1950, this is just \u2014 consider this entertainment, otherwise it's memory lane.This was Bert the Turtle. (Video) This was basically an attempt to teach our schoolchildren that if we did get engaged in a nuclear confrontation and atomic war, then we wanted our school children to kind of basically duck and cover. That was the principle. You \u2014 there would be a nuclear conflagration about to hit us, and if you get under your desk, things would be OK.(Laughter)I didn't do all that well in psychiatry in medical school, but I was interested, and I think this was seriously delusional.(Laughter)Secondly, we told people to go down in their basements and build a fallout shelter. Maybe it would be a study when we weren't having an atomic war, or you could use it as a TV room, or, as many teenagers found out, a very, very safe place for a little privacy with your girlfriend. And actually \u2014 so there are multiple uses of the bomb shelters. Or you could buy a prefabricated bomb shelter that you could simply bury in the ground. Now, the bomb shelters at that point \u2014 let's say you bought a prefab one \u2014 it would be a few hundred dollars, maybe up to 500, if you got a fancy one. Yet, what percentage of Americans do you think ever had a bomb shelter in their house? What percentage lived in a house with a bomb shelter?Less than two percent. About 1.4 percent of the population, as far as anyone knows, did anything, either making a space in their basement or actually building a bomb shelter. Many buildings, public buildings, around the country \u2014 this is New York City \u2014 had these little civil defense signs, and the idea was that you would run into one of these shelters and be safe from the nuclear weaponry. And one of the greatest governmental delusions of all time was something that happened in the early days of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, FEMA, as we now know, and are well aware of their behaviors from Katrina. Here is their first big public announcement. They would propose \u2014 actually there were about six volumes written on this \u2014 a crisis relocation plan that was dependent upon the United States having three to four days warning that the Soviets were going to attack us. So the goal was to evacuate the target cities. We would move people out of the target cities into the countryside.And I'm telling you, I actually testified at the Senate about the absolute ludicrous idea that we would actually evacuate, and actually have three or four days' warning. It was just completely off the wall. Turns out that they had another idea behind it, even though this was \u2014 they were telling the public it was to save us. The idea was that we would force the Soviets to re-target their nuclear weapons \u2014 very expensive \u2014 and potentially double their arsenal, to not only take out the original site, but take out sites where people were going. This was what apparently, as it turns out, was behind all this. It was just really, really frightening.The main point here is we were dealing with a complete disconnect from reality. The civil defense programs were disconnected from the reality of what we'd see in all-out nuclear war. So organizations like Physicians for Social Responsibility, around 1979, started saying this a lot publicly. They would do a bombing run. They'd go to your city, and they'd say, \"Here's a map of your city. Here's what's going to happen if we get a nuclear hit.\" So no possibility of medical response to, or meaningful preparedness for all-out nuclear war. So we had to prevent nuclear war if we expected to survive. This disconnect was never actually resolved. And what happened was \u2014 when we get in to chapter two of the nuclear threat era, which started back in 1945.Chapter two starts in 1991. When the Soviet Union broke up, we effectively lost that adversary as a potential attacker of the United States, for the most part. It's not completely gone. I'm going to come back to that. But from 1991 through the present time, emphasized by the attacks of 2001, the idea of an all-out nuclear war has diminished and the idea of a single event, act of nuclear terrorism is what we have instead. Although the scenario has changed very considerably, the fact is that we haven't changed our mental image of what a nuclear war means. So I'm going to tell you what the implications of that are in just a second. So, what is a nuclear terror threat? And there's four key ingredients to describing that.First thing is that the global nuclear weapons, in the stockpiles that I showed you in those original maps, happen to be not uniformly secure. And it's particularly not secure in the former Soviet Union, now in Russia. There are many, many sites where warheads are stored and, in fact, lots of sites where fissionable materials, like highly enriched uranium and plutonium, are absolutely not safe. They're available to be bought, stolen, whatever. They're acquirable, let me put it that way. From 1993 through 2006, the International Atomic Energy Agency documented 175 cases of nuclear theft, 18 of which involved highly enriched uranium or plutonium, the key ingredients to make a nuclear weapon. The global stockpile of highly enriched uranium is about 1,300, at the low end, to about 2,100 metric tons. More than 100 megatons of this is stored in particularly insecure Russian facilities. How much of that do you think it would take to actually build a 10-kiloton bomb? Well, you need about 75 pounds of it.So, what I'd like to show you is what it would take to hold 75 pounds of highly enriched uranium. This is not a product placement. It's just \u2014 in fact, if I was Coca Cola, I'd be pretty distressed about this \u2014 (Laughter) \u2014 but basically, this is it.This is what you would need to steal or buy out of that 100-metric-ton stockpile that's relatively insecure to create the type of bomb that was used in Hiroshima. Now you might want to look at plutonium as another fissionable material that you might use in a bomb. That \u2014 you'd need 10 to 13 pounds of plutonium. Now, plutonium, 10 to 13 pounds: this. This is enough plutonium to create a Nagasaki-size atomic weapon. Now this situation, already I \u2014 you know, I don't really like thinking about this, although somehow I got myself a job where I have to think about it. So the point is that we're very, very insecure in terms of developing this material. The second thing is, what about the know-how?And there's a lot of controversy about whether terror organizations have the know-how to actually make a nuclear weapon. Well, there's a lot of know-how out there. There's an unbelievable amount of know-how out there. There's detailed information on how to assemble a nuclear weapon from parts. There's books about how to build a nuclear bomb. There are plans for how to create a terror farm where you could actually manufacture and develop all the components and assemble it. All of this information is relatively available. If you have an undergraduate degree in physics, I would suggest \u2014 although I don't, so maybe it's not even true \u2014 but something close to that would allow you, with the information that's currently available, to actually build a nuclear weapon.The third element of the nuclear terror threat is that, who would actually do such a thing? Well, what we're seeing now is a level of terrorism that involves individuals who are highly organized. They are very dedicated and committed. They are stateless. Somebody once said, Al Qaeda does not have a return address, so if they attack us with a nuclear weapon, what's the response, and to whom is the response? And they're retaliation-proof. Since there is no real retribution possible that would make any difference, since there are people willing to actually give up their lives in order to do a lot of damage to us, it becomes apparent that the whole notion of this mutually assured destruction would not work.Here is Sulaiman Abu Ghaith, and Sulaiman was a key lieutenant of Osama Bin Laden. He wrote many, many times statements to this effect: \"we have the right to kill four million Americans, two million of whom should be children.\" And we don't have to go overseas to find people willing to do harm, for whatever their reasons. McVeigh and Nichols, and the Oklahoma City attack in the 1990s was a good example of homegrown terrorists. What if they had gotten their hands on a nuclear weapon? The fourth element is that the high-value U.S. targets are accessible, soft and plentiful.This would be a talk for another day, but the level of the preparedness that the United States has achieved since 9/11 of '01 is unbelievably inadequate. What you saw after Katrina is a very good indicator of how little prepared the United States is for any kind of major attack. Seven million ship cargo containers come into the United States every year. Five to seven percent only are inspected \u2014 five to seven percent.This is Alexander Lebed, who was a general that worked with Yeltsin, who talked about, and presented to Congress, this idea that the Russians had developed \u2014 these suitcase bombs. They were very low yield \u2014 0.1 to one kiloton, Hiroshima was around 13 kilotons \u2014 but enough to do an unbelievable amount of damage. And Lebed came to the United States and told us that many, many \u2014 more than 80 of the suitcase bombs were actually not accountable. And they look like this. They're basically very simple arrangements. You put the elements into a suitcase. It becomes very portable. The suitcase can be conveniently dropped in your trunk of your car. You take it wherever you want to take it, and you can detonate it.You don't want to build a suitcase bomb, and you happen to get one of those insecure nuclear warheads that exist. This is the size of the \"Little Boy\" bomb that was dropped at Hiroshima. It was 9.8 feet long, weighed 8,800 pounds. You go down to your local rent-a-truck and for 50 bucks or so, you rent a truck that's got the right capacity, and you take your bomb, you put it in the truck and you're ready to go. It could happen. But what it would mean and who would survive? You can't get an exact number for that kind of probability, but what I'm trying to say is that we have all the elements of that happening. Anybody who dismisses the thought of a nuclear weapon being used by a terrorist is kidding themselves.I think there's a lot of people in the intelligence community \u2014 a lot of people who deal with this work in general think it's almost inevitable, unless we do certain things to really try to defuse the risk, like better interdiction, better prevention, better fixing, you know, better screening of cargo containers that are coming into the country and so forth. There's a lot that can be done to make us a lot safer. At this particular moment, we actually could end up seeing a nuclear detonation in one of our cities. I don't think we would see an all-out nuclear war any time soon, although even that is not completely off the table. There's still enough nuclear weapons in the arsenals of the superpowers to destroy the Earth many, many times over. There are flash points in India and Pakistan, in the Middle East, in North Korea, other places where the use of nuclear weapons, while initially locally, could very rapidly go into a situation where we'd be facing all-out nuclear war. It's very unsettling.Here we go. OK. I'm back in my truck, and we drove over the Brooklyn Bridge. We're coming down, and we bring that truck that you just saw somewhere in here, in the Financial District. This is a 10-kiloton bomb, slightly smaller than was used in Hiroshima. And I want to just conclude this by just giving you some information. I think \u2014 \"news you could use\" kind of concept here. So, first of all, this would be horrific beyond anything we can possibly imagine. This is the ultimate. And if you're in the half-mile radius of where this bomb went off, you have a 90 percent chance of not making it. If you're right where the bomb went off, you will be vaporized. And that's \u2014 I'm just telling you, this is not good.(Laughter)You assume that. Two-mile radius, you have a 50 percent chance of being killed, and up to about eight miles away \u2014 now I'm talking about killed instantly \u2014 somewhere between a 10 and 20 percent chance of getting killed. The thing about this is that the experience of the nuclear detonation is \u2014 first of all, tens of millions of degrees Fahrenheit at the core here, where it goes off, and an extraordinary amount of energy in the form of heat, acute radiation and blast effects. An enormous hurricane-like wind, and destruction of buildings almost totally, within this yellow circle here. And what I'm going to focus on, as I come to conclusion here, is that, what happens to you if you're in here? Well, if we're talking about the old days of an all-out nuclear attack, you, up here, are as dead as the people here. So it was a moot point. My point now, though, is that there is a lot that we could do for you who are in here, if you've survived the initial blast. You have, when the blast goes off \u2014 and by the way, if it ever comes up, don't look at it.(Laughter)If you look at it, you're going to be blind, either temporarily or permanently. So if there's any way that you can avoid, like, avert your eyes, that would be a good thing. If you find yourself alive, but you're in the vicinity of a nuclear weapon, you have \u2014 that's gone off \u2014 you have 10 to 20 minutes, depending on the size and exactly where it went off, to get out of the way before a lethal amount of radiation comes straight down from the mushroom cloud that goes up. In that 10 to 15 minutes, all you have to do \u2014 and I mean this seriously \u2014 is go about a mile away from the blast. And what happens is \u2014 this is \u2014 I'm going to show you now some fallout plumes. Within 20 minutes, it comes straight down. Within 24 hours, lethal radiation is going out with prevailing winds, and it's mostly in this particular direction \u2014 it's going northeast.And if you're in this vicinity, you've got to get away. So you're feeling the wind \u2014 and there's tremendous wind now that you're going to be feeling \u2014 and you want to go perpendicular to the wind [not upwind or downwind]. if you are in fact able to see where the blast was in front of you. You've got to get out of there. If you don't get out of there, you're going to be exposed to lethal radiation in very short order. If you can't get out of there, we want you to go into a shelter and stay there. Now, in a shelter in an urban area means you have to be either in a basement as deep as possible, or you have to be on a floor \u2014 on a high floor \u2014 if it's a ground burst explosion, which it would be, higher than the ninth floor. So you have to be tenth floor or higher, or in the basement. But basically, you've got to get out of town as quickly as possible. And if you do that, you actually can survive a nuclear blast.Over the next few days to a week, there will be a radiation cloud, again, going with the wind, and settling down for another 15 or 20 miles out \u2014 in this case, over Long Island. And if you're in the direct fallout zone here, you really have to either be sheltered or you have to get out of there, and that's clear. But if you are sheltered, you can actually survive. The difference between knowing information of what you're going to do personally, and not knowing information, can save your life, and it could mean the difference between 150,000 to 200,000 fatalities from something like this and half a million to 700,000 fatalities.So, response planning in the twenty-first century is both possible and is essential. But in 2008, there isn't one single American city that has done effective plans to deal with a nuclear detonation disaster. Part of the problem is that the emergency planners themselves, personally, are overwhelmed psychologically by the thought of nuclear catastrophe. They are paralyzed. You say \"nuclear\" to them, and they're thinking, \"Oh my God, we're all gone. What's the point? It's futile.\" And we're trying to tell them, \"It's not futile. We can change the survival rates by doing some commonsensical things.\"So the goal here is to minimize fatalities. And I just want to leave you with the personal points that I think you might be interested in. The key to surviving a nuclear blast is getting out, and not going into harm's way. That's basically all we're going to be talking about here. And the farther you are away in distance, the longer it is in time from the initial blast; and the more separation between you and the outside atmosphere, the better. So separation \u2014 hopefully with dirt or concrete, or being in a basement \u2014 distance and time is what will save you.So here's what you do. First of all, as I said, don't stare at the light flash, if you can. I don't know you could possibly resist doing that. But let's assume, theoretically, you want to do that. You want to keep your mouth open, so your eardrums don't burst from the pressures. If you're very close to what happened, you actually do have to duck and cover, like Bert told you, Bert the Turtle. And you want to get under something so that you're not injured or killed by objects, if that's at all possible. You want to get away from the initial fallout mushroom cloud, I said, in just a few minutes. And shelter and place. You want to move [only] crosswind for 1.2 miles.You know, if you're out there and you see buildings horribly destroyed and down in that direction, less destroyed here, then you know that it was over there, the blast, and you're going this way, as long as you're going crosswise to the wind. Once you're out and evacuating, you want to keep as much of your skin, your mouth and nose covered, as long as that covering doesn't impede you moving and getting out of there. And finally, you want to get decontaminated as soon as possible. And if you're wearing clothing, you've taken off your clothing, you're going to get showered down some place and remove the radiation that would be \u2014 the radioactive material that might be on you. And then you want to stay in shelter for 48 to 72 hours minimum, but you're going to wait hopefully \u2014 you'll have your little wind-up, battery-less radio, and you'll be waiting for people to tell you when it's safe to go outside. That's what you need to do.In conclusion, nuclear war is less likely than before, but by no means out of the question, and it's not survivable. Nuclear terrorism is possible \u2014 it may be probable \u2014 but is survivable. And this is Jack Geiger, who's one of the heroes of the U.S. public health community. And Jack said the only way to deal with nuclear anything, whether it's war or terrorism, is abolition of nuclear weapons. And you want something to work on once you've fixed global warming, I urge you to think about the fact that we have to do something about this unacceptable, inhumane reality of nuclear weapons in our world.Now, this is my favorite civil defense slide, and I \u2014 (Laughter) \u2014 I don't want to be indelicate, but this \u2014 he's no longer in office. We don't really care, OK. This was sent to me by somebody who is an aficionado of civil defense procedures, but the fact of the matter is that America's gone through a very hard time. We've not been focused, we've not done what we had to do, and now we're facing the potential of bad, hell on Earth.

They could be \"re-commissioned,\"\n\n00:02:51.958 --> 00:02:54.958\nbut the way they count things, which is very complicated,\n\n00:02:54.958 --> 00:02:56.958\nwe think we have about a third\n\n00:02:56.958 --> 00:02:58.958\nof the nuclear weapons we had before.\n\n00:02:58.958 --> 00:03:00.958\nBut we also, in that period of time,\n\n00:03:00.958 --> 00:03:02.958\nadded two more members to the nuclear club:\n\n00:03:02.958 --> 00:03:05.958\nPakistan and North Korea.\n\n00:03:05.958 --> 00:03:08.958\nSo we stand today with a still fully armed nuclear arsenal\n\n00:03:09.958 --> 00:03:11.958\namong many countries around the world,\n\n00:03:11.958 --> 00:03:13.958\nbut a very different set of circumstances.\n\n00:03:13.958 --> 00:03:15.958\nSo I'm going to talk about\n\n00:03:16.958 --> 00:03:18.958\na nuclear threat story in two chapters.\n\n00:03:18.958 --> 00:03:21.958\nChapter one is 1949 to 1991,\n\n00:03:21.958 --> 00:03:23.958\nwhen the Soviet Union broke up,\n\n00:03:23.958 --> 00:03:26.958\nand what we were dealing with, at that point and through those years,\n\n00:03:26.958 --> 00:03:29.958\nwas a superpowers' nuclear arms race.\n\n00:03:29.958 --> 00:03:31.958\nIt was characterized by\n\n00:03:31.958 --> 00:03:33.958\na nation-versus-nation,\n\n00:03:33.958 --> 00:03:35.958\nvery fragile standoff.\n\n00:03:35.958 --> 00:03:37.958\nAnd basically,\n\n00:03:37.958 --> 00:03:39.958\nwe lived for all those years,\n\n00:03:39.958 --> 00:03:41.958\nand some might argue that we still do,\n\n00:03:41.958 --> 00:03:43.958\nin a situation of\n\n00:03:43.958 --> 00:03:45.958\nbeing on the brink, literally,\n\n00:03:45.958 --> 00:03:49.958\nof an apocalyptic, planetary calamity.\n\n00:03:49.958 --> 00:03:52.958\nIt's incredible that we actually lived through all that.\n\n00:03:52.958 --> 00:03:54.958\nWe were totally dependent during those years\n\n00:03:54.958 --> 00:03:57.958\non this amazing acronym, which is MAD.\n\n00:03:57.958 --> 00:04:00.958\nIt stands for mutually assured destruction.\n\n00:04:00.958 --> 00:04:02.958\nSo it meant\n\n00:04:02.958 --> 00:04:04.958\nif you attacked us, we would attack you\n\n00:04:04.958 --> 00:04:06.958\nvirtually simultaneously,\n\n00:04:06.958 --> 00:04:08.958\nand the end result would be a destruction\n\n00:04:08.958 --> 00:04:10.958\nof your country and mine.\n\n00:04:10.958 --> 00:04:12.958\nSo the threat of my own destruction\n\n00:04:12.958 --> 00:04:14.958\nkept me from launching\n\n00:04:14.958 --> 00:04:18.958\na nuclear attack on you. That's the way we lived.\n\n00:04:18.958 --> 00:04:20.958\nAnd the danger of that, of course, is that\n\n00:04:20.958 --> 00:04:23.958\na misreading of a radar screen\n\n00:04:23.958 --> 00:04:25.958\ncould actually cause a counter-launch,\n\n00:04:25.958 --> 00:04:28.958\neven though the first country had not actually launched anything.\n\n00:04:28.958 --> 00:04:30.958\nDuring this chapter one,\n\n00:04:30.958 --> 00:04:32.958\nthere was a high level of public awareness\n\n00:04:32.958 --> 00:04:35.958\nabout the potential of nuclear catastrophe,\n\n00:04:35.958 --> 00:04:37.958\nand an indelible image was implanted\n\n00:04:37.958 --> 00:04:39.958\nin our collective minds\n\n00:04:39.958 --> 00:04:41.958\nthat, in fact, a nuclear holocaust\n\n00:04:41.958 --> 00:04:44.958\nwould be absolutely globally destructive\n\n00:04:44.958 --> 00:04:47.958\nand could, in some ways, mean the end of civilization as we know it.\n\n00:04:47.958 --> 00:04:50.958\nSo this was chapter one.\n\n00:04:50.958 --> 00:04:52.958\nNow the odd thing is that even though\n\n00:04:52.958 --> 00:04:54.958\nwe knew that there would be\n\n00:04:54.958 --> 00:04:57.958\nthat kind of civilization obliteration,\n\n00:04:57.958 --> 00:04:59.958\nwe engaged in America in a series --\n\n00:04:59.958 --> 00:05:01.958\nand in fact, in the Soviet Union --\n\n00:05:01.958 --> 00:05:03.958\nin a series of response planning.\n\n00:05:03.958 --> 00:05:05.958\nIt was absolutely incredible.\n\n00:05:05.958 --> 00:05:07.958\nSo premise one is we'd be destroying the world,\n\n00:05:07.958 --> 00:05:10.958\nand then premise two is, why don't we get prepared for it?\n\n00:05:10.958 --> 00:05:12.958\nSo what\n\n00:05:12.958 --> 00:05:14.958\nwe offered ourselves\n\n00:05:14.958 --> 00:05:16.958\nwas a collection of things.

(Video)\n\n00:05:41.958 --> 00:05:43.958\nThis was basically an attempt\n\n00:05:43.958 --> 00:05:45.958\nto teach our schoolchildren\n\n00:05:45.958 --> 00:05:47.958\nthat if we did get engaged\n\n00:05:47.958 --> 00:05:50.958\nin a nuclear confrontation and atomic war,\n\n00:05:50.958 --> 00:05:52.958\nthen we wanted our school children\n\n00:05:52.958 --> 00:05:54.958\nto kind of basically duck and cover.\n\n00:05:54.958 --> 00:05:56.958\nThat was the principle. You --\n\n00:05:56.958 --> 00:05:58.958\nthere would be a nuclear conflagration\n\n00:05:58.958 --> 00:06:00.958\nabout to hit us, and if you get under your desk,\n\n00:06:00.958 --> 00:06:02.958\nthings would be OK.\n\n00:06:02.958 --> 00:06:04.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:06:04.958 --> 00:06:06.958\nI didn't do all that well\n\n00:06:06.958 --> 00:06:08.958\nin psychiatry in medical school, but I was interested,\n\n00:06:08.958 --> 00:06:11.958\nand I think this was seriously delusional.\n\n00:06:11.958 --> 00:06:13.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:06:13.958 --> 00:06:15.958\nSecondly, we told people\n\n00:06:15.958 --> 00:06:17.958\nto go down in their basements\n\n00:06:17.958 --> 00:06:19.958\nand build a fallout shelter.\n\n00:06:19.958 --> 00:06:22.958\nMaybe it would be a study when we weren't having an atomic war,\n\n00:06:22.958 --> 00:06:25.958\nor you could use it as a TV room, or, as many teenagers found out,\n\n00:06:25.958 --> 00:06:28.958\na very, very safe place for a little privacy with your girlfriend.\n\n00:06:28.958 --> 00:06:31.958\nAnd actually -- so there are multiple uses of the bomb shelters.\n\n00:06:31.958 --> 00:06:34.958\nOr you could buy a prefabricated bomb shelter\n\n00:06:34.958 --> 00:06:36.958\nthat you could simply bury in the ground.\n\n00:06:36.958 --> 00:06:38.958\nNow, the bomb shelters at that point --\n\n00:06:38.958 --> 00:06:40.958\nlet's say you bought a prefab one -- it would be a few hundred dollars,\n\n00:06:40.958 --> 00:06:42.958\nmaybe up to 500, if you got a fancy one.\n\n00:06:42.958 --> 00:06:44.958\nYet, what percentage of Americans\n\n00:06:44.958 --> 00:06:46.958\ndo you think ever had a bomb shelter in their house?\n\n00:06:46.958 --> 00:06:48.958\nWhat percentage lived in a house with a bomb shelter?\n\n00:06:49.958 --> 00:06:52.958\nLess than two percent. About 1.4 percent\n\n00:06:52.958 --> 00:06:54.958\nof the population, as far as anyone knows,\n\n00:06:54.958 --> 00:06:56.958\ndid anything,\n\n00:06:56.958 --> 00:06:58.958\neither making a space in their basement\n\n00:06:58.958 --> 00:07:01.958\nor actually building a bomb shelter.\n\n00:07:01.958 --> 00:07:03.958\nMany buildings, public buildings, around the country --\n\n00:07:03.958 --> 00:07:06.958\nthis is New York City -- had these little civil defense signs,\n\n00:07:06.958 --> 00:07:08.958\nand the idea was that you would\n\n00:07:08.958 --> 00:07:10.958\nrun into one of these shelters and be safe\n\n00:07:10.958 --> 00:07:12.958\nfrom the nuclear weaponry.\n\n00:07:12.958 --> 00:07:15.958\nAnd one of the greatest governmental delusions\n\n00:07:15.958 --> 00:07:17.958\nof all time was something that happened\n\n00:07:17.958 --> 00:07:19.958\nin the early days of\n\n00:07:19.958 --> 00:07:22.958\nthe Federal Emergency Management Agency, FEMA, as we now know,\n\n00:07:22.958 --> 00:07:25.958\nand are well aware of their behaviors from Katrina.\n\n00:07:25.958 --> 00:07:28.958\nHere is their first big public\n\n00:07:28.958 --> 00:07:30.958\nannouncement.\n\n00:07:30.958 --> 00:07:32.958\nThey would propose --\n\n00:07:32.958 --> 00:07:34.958\nactually there were about six volumes written on this --\n\n00:07:34.958 --> 00:07:36.958\na crisis relocation plan\n\n00:07:36.958 --> 00:07:38.958\nthat was dependent upon\n\n00:07:38.958 --> 00:07:41.958\nthe United States having three to four days warning\n\n00:07:41.958 --> 00:07:43.958\nthat the Soviets were going to attack us.\n\n00:07:43.958 --> 00:07:46.958\nSo the goal was to evacuate the target cities.\n\n00:07:46.958 --> 00:07:48.958\nWe would move people out of the target cities\n\n00:07:48.958 --> 00:07:50.958\ninto the countryside.\n\n00:07:50.958 --> 00:07:53.958\nAnd I'm telling you, I actually testified at the Senate\n\n00:07:53.958 --> 00:07:56.958\nabout the absolute ludicrous idea\n\n00:07:56.958 --> 00:07:57.958\nthat we would actually evacuate,\n\n00:07:57.958 --> 00:07:59.958\nand actually have three or four days' warning.\n\n00:07:59.958 --> 00:08:01.958\nIt was just completely off the wall.\n\n00:08:01.958 --> 00:08:04.958\nTurns out that they had another idea\n\n00:08:04.958 --> 00:08:06.958\nbehind it, even though this was --\n\n00:08:06.958 --> 00:08:08.958\nthey were telling the public it was to save us.\n\n00:08:08.958 --> 00:08:10.958\nThe idea was that we would force the Soviets\n\n00:08:10.958 --> 00:08:13.958\nto re-target their nuclear weapons -- very expensive --\n\n00:08:13.958 --> 00:08:15.958\nand potentially double their arsenal,\n\n00:08:15.958 --> 00:08:17.958\nto not only take out the original site,\n\n00:08:17.958 --> 00:08:20.958\nbut take out sites where people were going.\n\n00:08:20.958 --> 00:08:23.958\nThis was what apparently, as it turns out, was behind all this.\n\n00:08:23.958 --> 00:08:26.958\nIt was just really, really frightening.\n\n00:08:26.958 --> 00:08:28.958\nThe main point here is we were dealing with\n\n00:08:28.958 --> 00:08:31.958\na complete disconnect from reality.\n\n00:08:31.958 --> 00:08:34.958\nThe civil defense programs were disconnected\n\n00:08:34.958 --> 00:08:36.958\nfrom the reality of what we'd see in all-out nuclear war.\n\n00:08:36.958 --> 00:08:40.958\nSo organizations like Physicians for Social Responsibility,\n\n00:08:40.958 --> 00:08:43.958\naround 1979, started saying this a lot publicly.\n\n00:08:43.958 --> 00:08:46.958\nThey would do a bombing run. They'd go to your city,\n\n00:08:46.958 --> 00:08:48.958\nand they'd say, \"Here's a map of your city.\n\n00:08:48.958 --> 00:08:51.958\nHere's what's going to happen if we get a nuclear hit.\"\n\n00:08:51.958 --> 00:08:53.958\nSo no possibility of medical response to,\n\n00:08:53.958 --> 00:08:55.958\nor meaningful preparedness for\n\n00:08:55.958 --> 00:08:57.958\nall-out nuclear war.\n\n00:08:57.958 --> 00:08:59.958\nSo we had to prevent nuclear war\n\n00:08:59.958 --> 00:09:01.958\nif we expected to survive.\n\n00:09:01.958 --> 00:09:04.958\nThis disconnect was never actually resolved.\n\n00:09:04.958 --> 00:09:06.958\nAnd what happened was --\n\n00:09:06.958 --> 00:09:08.958\nwhen we get in to chapter two\n\n00:09:08.958 --> 00:09:11.958\nof the nuclear threat era,\n\n00:09:11.958 --> 00:09:13.958\nwhich started back in 1945.\n\n00:09:13.958 --> 00:09:15.958\nChapter two starts in 1991.\n\n00:09:15.958 --> 00:09:17.958\nWhen the Soviet Union broke up,\n\n00:09:17.958 --> 00:09:19.958\nwe effectively lost that adversary\n\n00:09:19.958 --> 00:09:22.958\nas a potential attacker of the United States, for the most part.\n\n00:09:22.958 --> 00:09:24.958\nIt's not completely gone. I'm going to come back to that.\n\n00:09:24.958 --> 00:09:26.958\nBut from 1991\n\n00:09:26.958 --> 00:09:28.958\nthrough the present time,\n\n00:09:28.958 --> 00:09:30.958\nemphasized by the attacks of 2001,\n\n00:09:30.958 --> 00:09:33.958\nthe idea of an all-out nuclear war\n\n00:09:33.958 --> 00:09:36.958\nhas diminished and the idea of a single event,\n\n00:09:36.958 --> 00:09:38.958\nact of nuclear terrorism\n\n00:09:38.958 --> 00:09:40.958\nis what we have instead.\n\n00:09:40.958 --> 00:09:43.958\nAlthough the scenario has changed\n\n00:09:43.958 --> 00:09:45.958\nvery considerably, the fact is\n\n00:09:45.958 --> 00:09:47.958\nthat we haven't changed our mental image\n\n00:09:47.958 --> 00:09:49.958\nof what a nuclear war means.\n\n00:09:49.958 --> 00:09:52.958\nSo I'm going to tell you what the implications of that are in just a second.\n\n00:09:52.958 --> 00:09:54.958\nSo, what is a nuclear terror threat?\n\n00:09:54.958 --> 00:09:57.958\nAnd there's four key ingredients to describing that.\n\n00:09:57.958 --> 00:10:00.958\nFirst thing is that the global nuclear weapons,\n\n00:10:00.958 --> 00:10:02.958\nin the stockpiles that I showed you in those original maps,\n\n00:10:02.958 --> 00:10:05.958\nhappen to be not uniformly secure.\n\n00:10:05.958 --> 00:10:07.958\nAnd it's particularly not secure\n\n00:10:07.958 --> 00:10:09.958\nin the former Soviet Union, now in Russia.\n\n00:10:09.958 --> 00:10:12.958\nThere are many, many sites where warheads are stored\n\n00:10:12.958 --> 00:10:15.958\nand, in fact, lots of sites where fissionable materials,\n\n00:10:15.958 --> 00:10:18.958\nlike highly enriched uranium and plutonium,\n\n00:10:18.958 --> 00:10:20.958\nare absolutely not safe.\n\n00:10:20.958 --> 00:10:23.958\nThey're available to be bought, stolen, whatever.\n\n00:10:23.958 --> 00:10:26.958\nThey're acquirable, let me put it that way.\n\n00:10:26.958 --> 00:10:29.958\nFrom 1993 through 2006,\n\n00:10:29.958 --> 00:10:31.958\nthe International Atomic Energy Agency\n\n00:10:31.958 --> 00:10:34.958\ndocumented 175 cases of nuclear theft,\n\n00:10:34.958 --> 00:10:38.958\n18 of which involved highly enriched uranium or plutonium,\n\n00:10:38.958 --> 00:10:42.958\nthe key ingredients to make a nuclear weapon.\n\n00:10:42.958 --> 00:10:45.958\nThe global stockpile of highly enriched uranium\n\n00:10:45.958 --> 00:10:47.958\nis about 1,300, at the low end,\n\n00:10:47.958 --> 00:10:50.958\nto about 2,100 metric tons.\n\n00:10:50.958 --> 00:10:52.958\nMore than 100 megatons of this\n\n00:10:52.958 --> 00:10:55.958\nis stored in particularly insecure\n\n00:10:55.958 --> 00:10:58.958\nRussian facilities.\n\n00:10:58.958 --> 00:11:00.958\nHow much of that do you think it would take\n\n00:11:00.958 --> 00:11:02.958\nto actually build a 10-kiloton bomb?\n\n00:11:02.958 --> 00:11:06.958\nWell, you need about 75 pounds of it.\n\n00:11:06.958 --> 00:11:09.958\nSo, what I'd like to show you\n\n00:11:09.958 --> 00:11:11.958\nis\n\n00:11:11.958 --> 00:11:13.958\nwhat it would take to hold 75 pounds\n\n00:11:14.958 --> 00:11:17.958\nof highly enriched uranium.\n\n00:11:17.958 --> 00:11:19.958\nThis is not a product placement.

This is enough plutonium\n\n00:11:55.958 --> 00:11:59.958\nto create a Nagasaki-size atomic weapon.\n\n00:12:00.958 --> 00:12:02.958\nNow this situation, already I --\n\n00:12:02.958 --> 00:12:05.958\nyou know, I don't really like thinking about this,\n\n00:12:05.958 --> 00:12:07.958\nalthough somehow I got myself a job\n\n00:12:07.958 --> 00:12:09.958\nwhere I have to think about it. So\n\n00:12:09.958 --> 00:12:12.958\nthe point is that we're very, very insecure\n\n00:12:12.958 --> 00:12:15.958\nin terms of developing this material.\n\n00:12:15.958 --> 00:12:17.958\nThe second thing is, what about the know-how?\n\n00:12:17.958 --> 00:12:19.958\nAnd there's a lot of controversy about\n\n00:12:19.958 --> 00:12:22.958\nwhether terror organizations have the know-how\n\n00:12:22.958 --> 00:12:25.958\nto actually make a nuclear weapon.\n\n00:12:25.958 --> 00:12:27.958\nWell, there's a lot of know-how out there.\n\n00:12:27.958 --> 00:12:30.958\nThere's an unbelievable amount of know-how out there.\n\n00:12:30.958 --> 00:12:32.958\nThere's detailed information on how to assemble\n\n00:12:32.958 --> 00:12:35.958\na nuclear weapon from parts.\n\n00:12:35.958 --> 00:12:38.958\nThere's books about how to build a nuclear bomb.\n\n00:12:38.958 --> 00:12:41.958\nThere are plans for how to create a terror farm\n\n00:12:41.958 --> 00:12:43.958\nwhere you could actually manufacture and develop\n\n00:12:43.958 --> 00:12:46.958\nall the components and assemble it.\n\n00:12:46.958 --> 00:12:49.958\nAll of this information is

I don't, so maybe it's not even true --\n\n00:12:55.958 --> 00:12:57.958\nbut something close to that would allow you,\n\n00:12:57.958 --> 00:12:59.958\nwith the information that's currently available,\n\n00:12:59.958 --> 00:13:02.958\nto actually build a nuclear weapon.\n\n00:13:03.958 --> 00:13:07.958\nThe third element of the nuclear terror threat\n\n00:13:07.958 --> 00:13:10.958\nis that, who would actually do such a thing?\n\n00:13:10.958 --> 00:13:13.958\nWell, what we're seeing now is a level of terrorism\n\n00:13:13.958 --> 00:13:16.958\nthat involves individuals who are highly organized.\n\n00:13:16.958 --> 00:13:18.958\nThey are very dedicated and committed.\n\n00:13:18.958 --> 00:13:20.958\nThey are stateless.\n\n00:13:20.958 --> 00:13:22.958\nSomebody once said,

response, and to whom is the response?\n\n00:13:29.958 --> 00:13:31.958\nAnd they're retaliation-proof.\n\n00:13:31.958 --> 00:13:34.958\nSince there is no real retribution possible\n\n00:13:34.958 --> 00:13:36.958\nthat would make any difference,\n\n00:13:36.958 --> 00:13:39.958\nsince there are people willing to actually give up their lives\n\n00:13:39.958 --> 00:13:41.958\nin order to do a lot of damage to us,\n\n00:13:41.958 --> 00:13:43.958\nit becomes apparent\n\n00:13:43.958 --> 00:13:45.958\nthat the whole notion\n\n00:13:45.958 --> 00:13:47.958\nof this mutually assured

But if you are sheltered,\n\n00:21:18.958 --> 00:21:20.958\nyou can actually survive.\n\n00:21:20.958 --> 00:21:22.958\nThe difference between knowing information\n\n00:21:22.958 --> 00:21:24.958\nof what you're going to do personally,\n\n00:21:24.958 --> 00:21:26.958\nand not knowing information, can save your life,\n\n00:21:26.958 --> 00:21:28.958\nand it could mean the difference between\n\n00:21:28.958 --> 00:21:30.958\n150,000 to 200,000 fatalities\n\n00:21:30.958 --> 00:21:33.958\nfrom something like this\n\n00:21:33.958 --> 00:21:36.958\nand half a million to 700,000 fatalities.\n\n00:21:36.958 --> 00:21:39.958\nSo, response planning in the twenty-first century\n\n00:21:39.958 --> 00:21:41.958\nis both possible and is essential.\n\n00:21:41.958 --> 00:21:45.958\nBut in 2008, there isn't one single American city\n\n00:21:45.958 --> 00:21:47.958\nthat has done effective plans\n\n00:21:47.958 --> 00:21:50.958\nto deal with a nuclear detonation disaster.\n\n00:21:50.958 --> 00:21:52.958\nPart of the problem is that\n\n00:21:52.958 --> 00:21:54.958\nthe emergency planners themselves, personally,\n\n00:21:54.958 --> 00:21:56.958\nare overwhelmed psychologically by the thought\n\n00:21:56.958 --> 00:21:58.958\nof nuclear catastrophe.\n\n00:21:58.958 --> 00:22:00.958\nThey are paralyzed.\n\n00:22:00.958 --> 00:22:02.958\nYou say \"nuclear\" to them, and they're thinking,\n\n00:22:02.958 --> 00:22:05.958\n\"Oh my God, we're all gone. What's the point? It's futile.\"\n\n00:22:05.958 --> 00:22:07.958\nAnd we're trying to tell them, \"It's not futile.\n\n00:22:07.958 --> 00:22:09.958\nWe can change the survival rates\n\n00:22:09.958 --> 00:22:12.958\nby doing some commonsensical things.\"\n\n00:22:12.958 --> 00:22:15.958\nSo the goal here is to minimize fatalities.\n\n00:22:15.958 --> 00:22:17.958\nAnd I just want to leave you with the personal points\n\n00:22:17.958 --> 00:22:19.958\nthat I think you might be interested in.\n\n00:22:19.958 --> 00:22:21.958\nThe key to surviving a nuclear blast\n\n00:22:21.958 --> 00:22:23.958\nis getting out,\n\n00:22:23.958 --> 00:22:26.958\nand not going into harm's way.\n\n00:22:26.958 --> 00:22:28.958\nThat's basically all we're going to be talking about here.\n\n00:22:28.958 --> 00:22:31.958\nAnd the farther you are away in distance,\n\n00:22:31.958 --> 00:22:33.958\nthe longer it is in time\n\n00:22:33.958 --> 00:22:35.958\nfrom the initial blast;\n\n00:22:35.958 --> 00:22:37.958\nand the more separation between you\n\n00:22:37.958 --> 00:22:39.958\nand the outside atmosphere, the better.\n\n00:22:39.958 --> 00:22:42.958\nSo separation -- hopefully with dirt or concrete,\n\n00:22:42.958 --> 00:22:44.958\nor being in a basement --\n\n00:22:44.958 --> 00:22:46.958\ndistance and time is what will save you.\n\n00:22:46.958 --> 00:22:48.958\nSo here's what you do. First of all,\n\n00:22:48.958 --> 00:22:50.958\nas I said, don't stare at the light flash,\n\n00:22:50.958 --> 00:22:52.958\nif you can. I don't know you could possibly resist doing that.\n\n00:22:52.958 --> 00:22:54.958\nBut let's assume, theoretically, you want to do that.\n\n00:22:54.958 --> 00:22:56.958\nYou want to keep your mouth open, so your eardrums\n\n00:22:56.958 --> 00:22:59.958\ndon't burst from the pressures.\n\n00:22:59.958 --> 00:23:02.958\nIf you're very close to what happened, you actually do have to duck and cover,\n\n00:23:02.958 --> 00:23:04.958\nlike Bert told you, Bert the Turtle.\n\n00:23:04.958 --> 00:23:07.958\nAnd you want to get under something so that you're not injured\n\n00:23:07.958 --> 00:23:09.958\nor killed by objects, if that's at all possible.\n\n00:23:09.958 --> 00:23:11.958\nYou want to get away from the initial fallout mushroom cloud,\n\n00:23:11.958 --> 00:23:13.958\nI said, in just a few minutes.\n\n00:23:13.958 --> 00:23:16.958\nAnd shelter and place. You want to move [only]\n\n00:23:16.958 --> 00:23:18.958\ncrosswind for 1.2 miles.\n\n00:23:18.958 --> 00:23:21.958\nYou know, if you're out there and you see buildings horribly destroyed\n\n00:23:21.958 --> 00:23:23.958\nand down in that direction,\n\n00:23:23.958 --> 00:23:25.958\nless destroyed here,\n\n00:23:25.958 --> 00:23:27.958\nthen you know that it was over there, the blast, and you're going this way,\n\n00:23:27.958 --> 00:23:31.958\nas long as you're going crosswise to the wind.\n\n00:23:31.958 --> 00:23:33.958\nOnce you're out and evacuating,\n\n00:23:33.958 --> 00:23:34.958\nyou want to keep as much of your skin,\n\n00:23:35.958 --> 00:23:37.958\nyour mouth and nose covered, as long as that covering\n\n00:23:37.958 --> 00:23:40.958\ndoesn't impede you moving and getting out of there.\n\n00:23:40.958 --> 00:23:43.958\nAnd finally, you want to get decontaminated as soon as possible.\n\n00:23:43.958 --> 00:23:45.958\nAnd if you're wearing clothing, you've taken off your clothing,\n\n00:23:45.958 --> 00:23:47.958\nyou're going to get showered down some place\n\n00:23:47.958 --> 00:23:49.958\nand remove the radiation that would be --\n\n00:23:49.958 --> 00:23:52.958\nthe radioactive material that might be on you.\n\n00:23:52.958 --> 00:23:56.958\nAnd then you want to stay in shelter for 48 to 72 hours minimum,\n\n00:23:56.958 --> 00:23:58.958\nbut you're going to wait hopefully -- you'll have your little wind-up,\n\n00:23:58.958 --> 00:24:00.958\nbattery-less radio,\n\n00:24:00.958 --> 00:24:02.958\nand you'll be waiting for people to tell you\n\n00:24:02.958 --> 00:24:04.958\nwhen it's safe to go outside. That's what you need to do.\n\n00:24:04.958 --> 00:24:06.958\nIn conclusion,\n\n00:24:06.958 --> 00:24:08.958\nnuclear war is less likely than before,\n\n00:24:08.958 --> 00:24:11.958\nbut by no means out of the question, and it's not survivable.\n\n00:24:11.958 --> 00:24:14.958\nNuclear terrorism is possible -- it may be probable --\n\n00:24:14.958 --> 00:24:16.958\nbut is survivable.\n\n00:24:16.958 --> 00:24:18.958\nAnd this is Jack Geiger, who's one of the heroes\n\n00:24:18.958 --> 00:24:21.958\nof the U.S. public health community.\n\n00:24:21.958 --> 00:24:23.958\nAnd Jack said the only way to deal\n\n00:24:23.958 --> 00:24:25.958\nwith nuclear anything,\n\n00:24:25.958 --> 00:24:27.958\nwhether it's war or terrorism,\n\n00:24:27.958 --> 00:24:29.958\nis abolition of nuclear weapons.\n\n00:24:29.958 --> 00:24:32.958\nAnd you want something to work on once you've fixed global warming,\n\n00:24:32.958 --> 00:24:34.958\nI urge you to think about the fact that\n\n00:24:34.958 --> 00:24:36.958\nwe have to do something about this\n\n00:24:36.958 --> 00:24:38.958\nunacceptable, inhumane\n\n00:24:38.958 --> 00:24:40.958\nreality of nuclear weapons\n\n00:24:40.958 --> 00:24:42.958\nin our world.\n\n00:24:42.958 --> 00:24:44.958\nNow, this is my favorite civil defense slide, and I --\n\n00:24:44.958 --> 00:24:46.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:24:46.958 --> 00:24:48.958\n-- I don't want to be indelicate, but\n\n00:24:48.958 --> 00:24:50.958\nthis --\n\n00:24:50.958 --> 00:24:53.958\nhe's no longer in office.

If we don't do that, we're going to get the generation we deserve. They're going to learn from whatever it is they have around them.And we, as now the elite, parents, librarians, professionals, whatever it is, a bunch of our activities are, in fact, in trying to get the best we have to offer within reach of those around us, or as broadly as we can. I'm going to start and end this talk with a couple things that are carved in stone. One is what's on the Boston Public Library. Carved above their door is, \"Free to All.\" It's kind of an inspiring statement, and I'll go back at the end of this. I'm a librarian, and what I'm trying to do is bring all of the works of knowledge to as many people as want to read it. And the idea of using technology is perfect for us. I think we have the opportunity to one-up the Greeks. It's not easy to one-up the Greeks. But with the industriousness of the Egyptians, they were able to build the Library of Alexandria \u2014 the idea of a copy of every book of all the peoples of the world. The problem was you actually had to go to Alexandria to go to it. On the other hand, if you did, then great things happened. I think we can one-up the Greeks and achieve something. And I'm going to try to argue only one point today: that universal access to all knowledge is within our grasp. So if I'm successful, then you'll actually come away thinking, yeah, we could actually achieve the great vision of everything ever published, everything that was ever meant for distribution, available to anybody in the world that's ever wanted to have access to it.Yes, there's issues about how money should be distributed, and that's still being refigured out. But I'd say there's plenty of money, and there's plenty of demand, so we can actually achieve that. But I'm going to go over the technological, social and sort of where are we as a whole, trying to get to that particular vision. And the way I'm going to try to do this is do it like the Amazon.com website, the books, music, video and just go step \u2014 media type by media type, just go and say, all right, how're we doing on this?So if we start with books, you know, sort of where are we? Well, first you have to, as an engineer, scope the problem. How big is it? If you wanted to put all of the published works online so that anybody could have it available, well, how big a problem is it? Well, we don't really know, but the largest print library in the world is the Library of Congress. It's 26 million volumes, 26 million volumes. It is, by far and away, the largest print library in the world. And a book, if you had a book, is about a megabyte, so \u2014 you know, if you had it in Microsoft Word. So a megabyte, 26 million megabytes is 26 terabytes \u2014 it goes mega-, giga-, tera-. 26 terabytes. 26 terabytes fits in a computer system that's about this big, on spinning Linux drives, and it costs about 60,000 dollars. So for the cost of a house \u2014 or around here, a garage \u2014 you can put, you can have spinning all of the words in the Library of Congress. That's pretty neat.Then the question is, what do you get? You know, is it worth trying to get there? Do you actually want it online? Some of the first things that people do is they make book readers that allow you to search inside the books, and that's kind of fun. And you can download these things, and look around them in new and different ways. And you can get at them remotely, if you happen to have a laptop. There's starting to be some of these sort of page turn-y interfaces that look a whole lot like books in certain ways, and you can search them, make little tabs, and it's kind of cute \u2014 still very book-like \u2014 on your laptop. But I don't know, reading things on a laptop \u2014 whenever I pull up my laptop, it always feels like work. I think that's one of the reasons why the Kindle is so great. I don't have to feel like I'm at work to read a Kindle. It's starting to be a little bit more specified. But I have to say that there's older technologies that I tend to like. I like the physical book. And I think we can go and use our technology to go and digitize things, put them on the Net, and then download, print them and bind them, and end up with books again.And we sort of said, well, how hard is this? And it turns out to not be very hard. We actually went off to make a bookmobile. And a bookmobile \u2014 the size of a van with a satellite dish, a printer, binder and cutter, and kids make their own books. It costs about three dollars to download, print and bind a normal, old book. And they actually come out kind of nice looking. You can actually get really good-looking books for on the order of one penny per page, sort of the parts cost for doing this.So the idea of \u2014 this technology actually may end up putting books back in people's hands again. There are some other bookmobiles running around. This is Eric Eldred making books at Walden Pond \u2014 Thoreau's works. This is just before he got kicked out by the Parks Services, for competing with the bookstore there. In India, they've got another couple bookmobiles running around. And this is the opening day at the Library of Alexandria, the new Library of Alexandria, in Egypt. It was quite popularly attended. And kids starting to make their own books, and a happy kid with the first book that he's ever owned. So the idea of being able to use this technology to end up with paper where I can handle sort of sounds a little retro, but I think it still has its place. And being from the Silicon Valley, sort of utopian sort of world, we thought, if we can make this technology work in rural Uganda, we might have something. So we actually got some funding from the World Bank to try it out. And we found in about 30 days we could go and take a couple folks from Silicon Valley, fly them to Uganda, buy a car, set up the first Internet connection at the National Library of Uganda, figure out what they wanted, and get a program going making books in rural Uganda. And it actually \u2014 so technologically, it works.What we found out of this is we didn't have the right books. So the books were in the library. We could get it to people, if they're digitized, but we didn't know how to quite get them digitized. Everybody thought the answer is, send things to India and China. And so we've tried that, and I'll go over that in a moment. There are some newer technologies for delivering that have happened that are actually quite exciting as well. One is a print-on-demand machine that looks like a Rube Goldberg machine. We have one of these things now. It's completely cool. It's all conveyor belt, and it makes a book. And it's called the \"Espresso Book Machine,\" and in about 10 minutes, you can press a button and make a book.Something else I'm quite excited about in this particular domain, beyond these sort of kiosk-y things where you can get books on demand, is some of these new little screens that are coming out. And one of my favorites in this is the $100 laptop. And I don't mean to steal any thunder here, but we've gone and used one of these things to be an e-book reader. So here's one of the beta units and you can \u2014 it actually turns out to be a really good-looking e-book reader. And we have a quick hack that we did to try to put one of our books on it, and it turns out that 200 dots per inch means that you can put scanned books on them that look really good. At 200 dots per inch, it's kind of the equivalent of a 300 dot print laser printer. We're in good enough shape. You actually can go and read scanned books quite easily.So the idea of electronic books is starting to come about. But how do you go about doing all this scanning? So we thought, okay, well, let's try out this send books to India thing. And there was a project with, funded by the National Science Foundation \u2014 sent a bunch of scanners, and the American libraries were supposed to send books. Well, they didn't. They didn't want to send their books. So we bought 100,000 books and sent them to India. And then we learned why you don't want to send books to India. The lesson we learned out of this is, scan your own books. If you really care about books, you're going to scan them better, especially if they're valuable books. If they're new books and you can just, you know, butcher them, because you could just buy another one, that's not such a big deal in terms of doing high-quality scanning. But do things that you love. But the Indians have been scanning a lot of their own books \u2014 about 300,000 now \u2014 doing very well. The Chinese did over a million, and the Egyptians are about 30,000.But we sent \u2014 thought, OK, if we're going to need to do this, let's do it in-library. How do we go and do this, and how do we get it down so that it's a cost point that we could afford? And we sort of picked the price point of 10 cents a page. If it's basically the cost of xeroxing to basically digitize, OCR, package it up, make it so that you could download, print and bind it \u2014 the whole shebang \u2014 we would have achieved something. So we started out trying to figure out. How do we get to 10 cents? And we tried these robot things, and they worked pretty well \u2014 sort of these auto-page-turning things. If we can have Mars Rovers, you'd think you could turn pages. But it actually turns out to be pretty hard to turn pages, and the volume isn't there. So anyway \u2014 so we ended up making our own book scanner, and with two digital, high-grade, professional digital cameras, controlled museum lighting, so even if it's a black and white book, you can go and get the proper intonation. So you basically do a beautiful, respectful job. This is not a fax, this is \u2014 the idea is to do a beautiful job as you're going through these libraries. And we've been able to achieve 10 cents a page if we run things in volume. This is what it looks like at the University of Toronto. And actually, it turns out to, you know, pay a living wage. People seem to love it. Yes, it's a little boring, but some people kind of get into the Zen of it. (Laughter) And especially if it's kind of interesting books that you care about, in languages that you can read. We actually have been able to do a pretty good job of this, at getting 10 cents a page. So 10 cents a page, 300 pages in your average book, 30 dollars a book. The Library of Congress, if you did the whole darn thing \u2014 26 million books \u2014 is about 750 million dollars, right? But a million books, I think, actually would be a pretty good start, and that would cost 30 million dollars. That's not that big a bill.And what we've been able to do is get into libraries. We've now got eight of these scanning centers in three countries, and libraries are up for having their books scanned. The Getty here is moving their books to the UCLA, which is where we have one these scanning centers, and scanning their out-of-copyright books, which is fabulous. So we're starting to get the institutional responsibility. The thing we're missing is the 10 cents. If we can get the 10 cents, all the rest of it flows. We've scanned about 200,000 books. Now we're scanning about 15,000 books a month, and it's starting to gear up another factor of two from there.So all in all, that's going very well. And we're starting to move out of the just out-of-copyright into the out-of-print world. So I think of \u2014 we're kind of going from the out-of-copyright, library stuff, and Amazon.com is coming from the in-print world. And I think we'll meet in the middle some place, and have the classic thing that you have, which is a publishing system and a library system working in parallel. And so we're starting up a program to do out-of-print works, but loaning them. Exactly what loaning means, I'm not quite sure. But anyway, loaning out-of-print works from the Boston Public Library, the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute and a few other libraries that are starting to participate in this program, to try out this model of where does a library stop and where does the bookstore take over. So all in all, it's possible to do this in large scale. We're also going back over microfilm and getting that online. So, we can do 10 cents a page, we're going 15,000 books a month and we've got about 250,000 books online, counting all the other projects that are starting to add in. So what I wanted to argue is, books are within our grasp. The idea of taking on the whole ball of wax is not that big a deal. Yes, it costs tens of millions, low hundreds of millions, but one time shot and we've got basically the history of printed literature online. And then, there's business model issues about how to try to effectively market it and get it to people. But it is within our grasp, technologically and law-wise, at least for the out of print and out of copyright, we suggest, to be able to get the whole darn thing online.Now let's go for audio, and I'm going to go through these. So how much is there? Well, as best we can tell, there are about two to three million disks having been published \u2014 so 78s, long-playing records and CDs \u2014 or at least that's the largest archives of published materials we've been able to sort of point at. It costs about 10 dollars a piece to go and take a disk and put it online, if you're doing things in volume. But we've found that the rights issues are really quite thorny. This is a fairly heavily litigated area, so we've found that there are niches in the music world that aren't served terribly well by the classic commercial publishing system. And we've been starting to make these available by going and offering shelf space on the Net. In the United States, it doesn't cost you to give something away. Right? If you give something to a charity or to the public, you get a pat on the back and a tax donation \u2014 except on the Net, where you can go broke. If you put up a video of your garage band, and it starts getting heavily accessed, you can lose your guitars or your house.This doesn't make any sense. So we've offered unlimited storage, unlimited bandwidth, forever, for free, to anybody that has something to share that belongs in a library. And we've been getting a lot of takers. One is the rock 'n' rollers. The rock 'n' rollers had a tradition of sharing, as long as nobody made any money. You could \u2014 concert recordings, it's not the commercial recordings, but concert recordings, started by the Grateful Dead. And we get about two or three bands a day signing up. They give permission, and we get about 40 or 50 concerts a day. We have about 40,000 concerts, everything the Grateful Dead ever did, up on the Net, so that people can see it and listen to this material. So audio is possible to put up, but the rights issues are really pretty thorny. We've got a lot of collections now \u2014 a couple hundred thousand items \u2014 and it's growing over time.Moving images: if you think of theatrical releases, there are not that many of them. As best we can tell, there are about 150,000 to 200,000 movies ever that are really meant for a large-scale theatrical distribution. It's just not that many. But half of those were Indian. But anyway, it's doable, but we've only found about a thousand of these things that \u2014 to be out of copyright. So we've digitized those and made those available. But we've found that there's lots of other types of movies that haven't really seen the light of day \u2014 archival films. We've found, also, a lot of political films, a lot of amateur films, all sorts of things that are basically needing a home, a permanent home. So we've been starting to make these available and it's grown to be very popular. We're not quite a YouTube. We tended towards longer-term things and also things that people can reuse and make into new movies, which has just been great fun.Television comes quite a bit larger. We started recording 20 channels of television 24 hours a day. It's sort of the biggest TiVo box you've ever seen. It's about a petabyte, so far, of worldwide television \u2014 Russian, Chinese, Japanese, Iraqi, Al Jazeera, BBC, CNN, ABC, CBS, NBC \u2014 24 hours a day. We only put one week up, which is mostly for cost reasons, which is the 9/11, sort of from 9/11/2001. For one week, what did the world see? CNN was saying that Palestinians were dancing in the streets. Were they? Let's look at the Palestinian television and find out. How can we have critical thinking without being able to quote and being able to compare what happened in the past? And television is dreadfully unrecorded and unquotable, except by Jon Stewart, who does a fabulous job. So anyway, television is, I would suggest, within our grasp. So 15 dollars per video hour, and also about 100 dollars to 150 dollars per celluloid hour, we're able to go and get materials online very inexpensively and have them up on the Net. And we've got, now, a lot of these materials. So we've got about 100,000 pieces up there. So books, music, video, software. There's only 50,000 titles of it. Mostly the issues there are legal issues and breaking copy protections. But we've worked through some of those, but we've still got real problems in Washington.Well, we're best known as the World Wide Web. We've been archiving the World Wide Web since 1996. We take a snapshot of every website and all of the pages on it, every two months. And actually, it's really been pioneered by Alexa Internet, which donates this collection to the Internet Archive. And it's been growing along for the last 11 years, and it's a fantastic resource. And we've made a Wayback Machine that you can then go and see old websites kind of the way they were. If you go and search on something \u2014 this is Google.com, the different versions of it that we have, this is what it looks like when it was an alpha release, and this is what it looked like at Stanford. So anyway, you've got basically an idea of where things came from. Mostly, people want to see their old stuff out of this. If there's one thing that we want to learn from the Library of Alexandria version one, which is probably best known for burning, is, don't just have one copy. So we've started to \u2014 we've made another copy of all of this and we actually put it back in the Library of Alexandria. So this is a picture of the Internet Archive at the Library of Alexandria. And we now have also another copy building up in Amsterdam. So, we should put it in the San Andreas Fault Line in San Francisco, flood zone in Amsterdam and in the Middle East. Right, so anyway ... so we're hedging our bets here. If we go and put it in a couple more places, I think we'll be in good shape.There's a political and social question out of this. Is all of this, as we go digital, is it going to be public or private? There's some large companies that have seen this vision, that are doing large-scale digitization, but they're locking up the public domain. The question is, is that the world that we really want to live in? What's the role of the public versus the private as things go forward? How do we go and have a world where we both have libraries and publishing in the future, just as we basically benefited as we were growing up? So universal access to all knowledge \u2014 I think it can be one of the greatest achievements of humankind, like the man on the moon, or the Gutenberg Bible, or the Library of Alexandria. It could be something that we're remembered for, for millennia, for having achieved. And as I said before, I'll end with something that's carved above the door of the Carnegie Library. Carnegie \u2014 one of the great capitalists of this country \u2014 carved above his legacy, \"Free to the People.\" Thank you very much.", "id": 346, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:11.958 --> 00:00:15.958\nWe really need to put the best we have to offer within reach of our children.\n\n00:00:15.958 --> 00:00:20.958\nIf we don't do that, we're going to get the generation we deserve.\n\n00:00:20.958 --> 00:00:23.958\nThey're going to learn from whatever it is they have around them.\n\n00:00:23.958 --> 00:00:31.958\nAnd we, as now the elite, parents, librarians, professionals, whatever it is,\n\n00:00:31.958 --> 00:00:35.958\na bunch of our activities are, in fact, in trying to get the best we have to offer\n\n00:00:35.958 --> 00:00:39.958\nwithin reach of those around us, or as broadly as we can.\n\n00:00:39.958 --> 00:00:42.958\nI'm going to start and end this talk with a couple things that are carved in stone.\n\n00:00:42.958 --> 00:00:46.958\nOne is what's on the Boston Public Library.\n\n00:00:46.958 --> 00:00:49.958\nCarved above their door is, \"Free to All.\"\n\n00:00:49.958 --> 00:00:51.958\nIt's kind of an inspiring statement,\n\n00:00:51.958 --> 00:00:53.958\nand I'll go back at the end of this.\n\n00:00:53.958 --> 00:00:58.958\nI'm a librarian, and what I'm trying to do is bring all of the works of knowledge\n\n00:00:58.958 --> 00:01:02.958\nto as many people as want to read it.\n\n00:01:02.958 --> 00:01:04.958\nAnd the idea of using technology is perfect for us.\n\n00:01:04.958 --> 00:01:08.958\nI think we have the opportunity to one-up the Greeks.\n\n00:01:08.958 --> 00:01:13.958\nIt's not easy to one-up the Greeks. But with the industriousness of the Egyptians,\n\n00:01:13.958 --> 00:01:15.958\nthey were able to build the Library of Alexandria --\n\n00:01:15.958 --> 00:01:19.958\nthe idea of a copy of every book of all the peoples of the world.\n\n00:01:19.958 --> 00:01:22.958\nThe problem was you actually had to go to Alexandria to go to it.\n\n00:01:22.958 --> 00:01:25.958\nOn the other hand, if you did, then great things happened.\n\n00:01:25.958 --> 00:01:28.958\nI think we can one-up the Greeks and achieve something.\n\n00:01:28.958 --> 00:01:31.958\nAnd I'm going to try to argue only one point today:\n\n00:01:31.958 --> 00:01:36.958\nthat universal access to all knowledge is within our grasp.\n\n00:01:36.958 --> 00:01:39.958\nSo if I'm successful, then you'll actually come away thinking,\n\n00:01:39.958 --> 00:01:46.958\nyeah, we could actually achieve the great vision of everything ever published,\n\n00:01:46.958 --> 00:01:48.958\neverything that was ever meant for distribution,\n\n00:01:48.958 --> 00:01:52.958\navailable to anybody in the world that's ever wanted to have access to it.\n\n00:01:52.958 --> 00:01:56.958\nYes, there's issues about how money should be distributed,\n\n00:01:56.958 --> 00:01:58.958\nand that's still being refigured out.\n\n00:01:58.958 --> 00:02:00.958\nBut I'd say there's plenty of money, and there's plenty of demand,\n\n00:02:00.958 --> 00:02:03.958\nso we can actually achieve that.\n\n00:02:03.958 --> 00:02:06.958\nBut I'm going to go over the technological, social\n\n00:02:06.958 --> 00:02:10.958\nand sort of where are we as a whole, trying to get to that particular vision.\n\n00:02:10.958 --> 00:02:15.958\nAnd the way I'm going to try to do this is do it like the Amazon.com website,\n\n00:02:15.958 --> 00:02:20.958\nthe books, music, video and just go step -- media type by media type,\n\n00:02:20.958 --> 00:02:23.958\njust go and say, all right, how're we doing on this?\n\n00:02:23.958 --> 00:02:27.958\nSo if we start with books, you know, sort of where are we?\n\n00:02:27.958 --> 00:02:31.958\nWell, first you have to, as an engineer, scope the problem. How big is it?\n\n00:02:31.958 --> 00:02:34.958\nIf you wanted to put all of the published works online\n\n00:02:34.958 --> 00:02:38.958\nso that anybody could have it available, well, how big a problem is it?\n\n00:02:38.958 --> 00:02:42.958\nWell, we don't really know, but the largest print library in the world\n\n00:02:42.958 --> 00:02:46.958\nis the Library of Congress. It's 26 million volumes, 26 million volumes.\n\n00:02:46.958 --> 00:02:49.958\nIt is, by far and away, the largest print library in the world.\n\n00:02:49.958 --> 00:02:53.958\nAnd a book, if you had a book, is about a megabyte,\n\n00:02:53.958 --> 00:02:57.958\nso -- you know, if you had it in Microsoft Word.\n\n00:02:57.958 --> 00:03:01.958\nSo a megabyte, 26 million megabytes is 26 terabytes --\n\n00:03:01.958 --> 00:03:04.958\nit goes mega-, giga-, tera-. 26 terabytes.\n\n00:03:04.958 --> 00:03:07.958\n26 terabytes fits in a computer system that's about this big,\n\n00:03:07.958 --> 00:03:12.958\non spinning Linux drives, and it costs about 60,000 dollars.\n\n00:03:12.958 --> 00:03:16.958\nSo for the cost of a house -- or around here, a garage --\n\n00:03:16.958 --> 00:03:21.958\nyou can put, you can have spinning all of the words in the Library of Congress.\n\n00:03:21.958 --> 00:03:23.958\nThat's pretty neat.\n\n00:03:23.958 --> 00:03:25.958\nThen the question is, what do you get?\n\n00:03:25.958 --> 00:03:27.958\nYou know, is it worth trying to get there?\n\n00:03:27.958 --> 00:03:29.958\nDo you actually want it online?\n\n00:03:29.958 --> 00:03:32.958\nSome of the first things that people do is they make book readers\n\n00:03:32.958 --> 00:03:35.958\nthat allow you to search inside the books, and that's kind of fun.\n\n00:03:35.958 --> 00:03:38.958\nAnd you can download these things, and look around them in new and different ways.\n\n00:03:38.958 --> 00:03:44.958\nAnd you can get at them remotely, if you happen to have a laptop.\n\n00:03:44.958 --> 00:03:48.958\nThere's starting to be some of these sort of page turn-y interfaces\n\n00:03:48.958 --> 00:03:51.958\nthat look a whole lot like books in certain ways,\n\n00:03:51.958 --> 00:03:53.958\nand you can search them, make little tabs, and it's kind of cute --\n\n00:03:53.958 --> 00:03:56.958\nstill very book-like -- on your laptop.\n\n00:03:56.958 --> 00:03:59.958\nBut I don't know, reading things on a laptop --\n\n00:03:59.958 --> 00:04:01.958\nwhenever I pull up my laptop, it always feels like work.\n\n00:04:01.958 --> 00:04:04.958\nI think that's one of the reasons why the Kindle is so great.\n\n00:04:04.958 --> 00:04:07.958\nI don't have to feel like I'm at work to read a Kindle.\n\n00:04:07.958 --> 00:04:10.958\nIt's starting to be a little bit more specified.\n\n00:04:10.958 --> 00:04:16.958\nBut I have to say that there's older technologies that I tend to like.\n\n00:04:17.958 --> 00:04:20.958\nI like the physical book.\n\n00:04:20.958 --> 00:04:25.958\nAnd I think we can go and use our technology to go and digitize things,\n\n00:04:25.958 --> 00:04:27.958\nput them on the Net, and then download,\n\n00:04:27.958 --> 00:04:29.958\nprint them and bind them, and end up with books again.\n\n00:04:29.958 --> 00:04:31.958\nAnd we sort of said, well, how hard is this?\n\n00:04:31.958 --> 00:04:33.958\nAnd it turns out to not be very hard.\n\n00:04:33.958 --> 00:04:35.958\nWe actually went off to make a bookmobile.\n\n00:04:35.958 --> 00:04:37.958\nAnd a bookmobile -- the size of a van with a satellite dish,\n\n00:04:37.958 --> 00:04:39.958\na printer, binder and cutter, and kids make their own books.\n\n00:04:39.958 --> 00:04:45.958\nIt costs about three dollars to download, print and bind a normal, old book.\n\n00:04:45.958 --> 00:04:47.958\nAnd they actually come out kind of nice looking.\n\n00:04:47.958 --> 00:04:50.958\nYou can actually get really good-looking books\n\n00:04:50.958 --> 00:04:54.958\nfor on the order of one penny per page, sort of the parts cost for doing this.\n\n00:04:54.958 --> 00:04:57.958\nSo the idea of -- this technology actually may end up\n\n00:04:57.958 --> 00:04:59.958\nputting books back in people's hands again.\n\n00:04:59.958 --> 00:05:01.958\nThere are some other bookmobiles running around.\n\n00:05:01.958 --> 00:05:05.958\nThis is Eric Eldred making books at Walden Pond -- Thoreau's works.\n\n00:05:05.958 --> 00:05:08.958\nThis is just before he got kicked out by the Parks Services,\n\n00:05:08.958 --> 00:05:11.958\nfor competing with the bookstore there.\n\n00:05:11.958 --> 00:05:14.958\nIn India, they've got another couple bookmobiles running around.\n\n00:05:14.958 --> 00:05:17.958\nAnd this is the opening day at the Library of Alexandria,\n\n00:05:17.958 --> 00:05:21.958\nthe new Library of Alexandria, in Egypt.\n\n00:05:21.958 --> 00:05:23.958\nIt was quite popularly attended.\n\n00:05:23.958 --> 00:05:26.958\nAnd kids starting to make their own books,\n\n00:05:26.958 --> 00:05:29.958\nand a happy kid with the first book that he's ever owned.\n\n00:05:29.958 --> 00:05:31.958\nSo the idea of being able to use this technology\n\n00:05:31.958 --> 00:05:34.958\nto end up with paper where I can handle sort of sounds a little retro,\n\n00:05:34.958 --> 00:05:37.958\nbut I think it still has its place.\n\n00:05:37.958 --> 00:05:41.958\nAnd being from the Silicon Valley, sort of utopian\n\n00:05:41.958 --> 00:05:43.958\nsort of world,\n\n00:05:43.958 --> 00:05:46.958\nwe thought, if we can make this technology work in rural Uganda,\n\n00:05:46.958 --> 00:05:48.958\nwe might have something.\n\n00:05:48.958 --> 00:05:52.958\nSo we actually got some funding from the World Bank to try it out.\n\n00:05:52.958 --> 00:05:56.958\nAnd we found in about 30 days we could go and take a couple folks from Silicon Valley,\n\n00:05:56.958 --> 00:06:02.958\nfly them to Uganda, buy a car, set up the first Internet connection\n\n00:06:02.958 --> 00:06:05.958\nat the National Library of Uganda, figure out what they wanted,\n\n00:06:05.958 --> 00:06:08.958\nand get a program going making books in rural Uganda.\n\n00:06:08.958 --> 00:06:11.958\nAnd it actually -- so technologically, it works.\n\n00:06:11.958 --> 00:06:14.958\nWhat we found out of this is we didn't have the right books.\n\n00:06:15.958 --> 00:06:18.958\nSo the books were in the library. We could get it to people, if they're digitized,\n\n00:06:18.958 --> 00:06:21.958\nbut we didn't know how to quite get them digitized.\n\n00:06:21.958 --> 00:06:26.958\nEverybody thought the answer is, send things to India and China.\n\n00:06:26.958 --> 00:06:28.958\nAnd so we've tried that, and I'll go over that in a moment.\n\n00:06:28.958 --> 00:06:31.958\nThere are some newer technologies for delivering\n\n00:06:31.958 --> 00:06:34.958\nthat have happened that are actually quite exciting as well.\n\n00:06:34.958 --> 00:06:37.958\nOne is a print-on-demand machine that looks like a Rube Goldberg machine.\n\n00:06:37.958 --> 00:06:39.958\nWe have one of these things now. It's completely cool.\n\n00:06:39.958 --> 00:06:44.958\nIt's all conveyor belt, and it makes a book.\n\n00:06:44.958 --> 00:06:46.958\nAnd it's called the \"Espresso Book Machine,\"\n\n00:06:46.958 --> 00:06:50.958\nand in about 10 minutes, you can press a button and make a book.\n\n00:06:50.958 --> 00:06:54.958\nSomething else I'm quite excited about in this particular domain,\n\n00:06:56.958 --> 00:07:00.958\nbeyond these sort of kiosk-y things where you can get books on demand,\n\n00:07:00.958 --> 00:07:04.958\nis some of these new little screens that are coming out.\n\n00:07:04.958 --> 00:07:08.958\nAnd one of my favorites in this is the $100 laptop.\n\n00:07:08.958 --> 00:07:14.958\nAnd I don't mean to steal any thunder here,\n\n00:07:14.958 --> 00:07:18.958\nbut we've gone and used one of these things to be an e-book reader.\n\n00:07:19.958 --> 00:07:25.958\nSo here's one of the beta units and you can --\n\n00:07:25.958 --> 00:07:33.958\nit actually turns out to be a really good-looking e-book reader.\n\n00:07:33.958 --> 00:07:37.958\nAnd we have a quick hack that we did to try to put one of our books on it,\n\n00:07:37.958 --> 00:07:40.958\nand it turns out that 200 dots per inch\n\n00:07:40.958 --> 00:07:43.958\nmeans that you can put scanned books on them that look really good.\n\n00:07:43.958 --> 00:07:47.958\nAt 200 dots per inch, it's kind of the equivalent of a 300 dot print laser printer.\n\n00:07:47.958 --> 00:07:49.958\nWe're in good enough shape.\n\n00:07:49.958 --> 00:07:52.958\nYou actually can go and read scanned books quite easily.\n\n00:07:52.958 --> 00:07:56.958\nSo the idea of electronic books is starting to come about.\n\n00:07:56.958 --> 00:07:58.958\nBut how do you go about doing all this scanning?\n\n00:07:58.958 --> 00:08:01.958\nSo we thought, okay, well, let's try out this send books to India thing.\n\n00:08:01.958 --> 00:08:06.958\nAnd there was a project with, funded by the National Science Foundation --\n\n00:08:06.958 --> 00:08:10.958\nsent a bunch of scanners, and the American libraries were supposed to send books.\n\n00:08:10.958 --> 00:08:13.958\nWell, they didn't. They didn't want to send their books.\n\n00:08:13.958 --> 00:08:15.958\nSo we bought 100,000 books and sent them to India.\n\n00:08:15.958 --> 00:08:18.958\nAnd then we learned why you don't want to send books to India.\n\n00:08:18.958 --> 00:08:22.958\nThe lesson we learned out of this is, scan your own books.\n\n00:08:22.958 --> 00:08:26.958\nIf you really care about books, you're going to scan them better,\n\n00:08:26.958 --> 00:08:28.958\nespecially if they're valuable books.\n\n00:08:28.958 --> 00:08:30.958\nIf they're new books and you can just, you know, butcher them,\n\n00:08:30.958 --> 00:08:32.958\nbecause you could just buy another one,\n\n00:08:32.958 --> 00:08:36.958\nthat's not such a big deal in terms of doing high-quality scanning.\n\n00:08:36.958 --> 00:08:39.958\nBut do things that you love.\n\n00:08:39.958 --> 00:08:42.958\nBut the Indians have been scanning a lot of their own books --\n\n00:08:42.958 --> 00:08:44.958\nabout 300,000 now -- doing very well.\n\n00:08:44.958 --> 00:08:49.958\nThe Chinese did over a million, and the Egyptians are about 30,000.\n\n00:08:49.958 --> 00:08:55.958\nBut we sent -- thought, OK, if we're going to need to do this, let's do it in-library.\n\n00:08:55.958 --> 00:08:57.958\nHow do we go and do this, and how do we get it down\n\n00:08:57.958 --> 00:08:59.958\nso that it's a cost point that we could afford?\n\n00:08:59.958 --> 00:09:02.958\nAnd we sort of picked the price point of 10 cents a page.\n\n00:09:02.958 --> 00:09:08.958\nIf it's basically the cost of xeroxing to basically digitize, OCR, package it up,\n\n00:09:08.958 --> 00:09:11.958\nmake it so that you could download, print and bind it -- the whole shebang --\n\n00:09:11.958 --> 00:09:13.958\nwe would have achieved something.\n\n00:09:13.958 --> 00:09:15.958\nSo we started out trying to figure out. How do we get to 10 cents?\n\n00:09:15.958 --> 00:09:18.958\nAnd we tried these robot things, and they worked pretty well --\n\n00:09:18.958 --> 00:09:20.958\nsort of these auto-page-turning things.\n\n00:09:20.958 --> 00:09:24.958\nIf we can have Mars Rovers, you'd think you could turn pages.\n\n00:09:24.958 --> 00:09:28.958\nBut it actually turns out to be pretty hard to turn pages, and the volume isn't there.\n\n00:09:28.958 --> 00:09:34.958\nSo anyway -- so we ended up making our own book scanner,\n\n00:09:34.958 --> 00:09:38.958\nand with two digital, high-grade, professional digital cameras,\n\n00:09:38.958 --> 00:09:41.958\ncontrolled museum lighting, so even if it's a black and white book,\n\n00:09:41.958 --> 00:09:45.958\nyou can go and get the proper intonation.\n\n00:09:45.958 --> 00:09:48.958\nSo you basically do a beautiful, respectful job.\n\n00:09:48.958 --> 00:09:52.958\nThis is not a fax, this is -- the idea is to do a beautiful job\n\n00:09:52.958 --> 00:09:55.958\nas you're going through these libraries.\n\n00:09:55.958 --> 00:09:59.958\nAnd we've been able to achieve 10 cents a page if we run things in volume.\n\n00:09:59.958 --> 00:10:02.958\nThis is what it looks like at the University of Toronto.\n\n00:10:02.958 --> 00:10:05.958\nAnd actually, it turns out to, you know, pay a living wage.\n\n00:10:05.958 --> 00:10:07.958\nPeople seem to love it.\n\n00:10:07.958 --> 00:10:11.958\nYes, it's a little boring, but some people kind of get into the Zen of it.\n\n00:10:11.958 --> 00:10:14.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:10:14.958 --> 00:10:16.958\nAnd especially if it's kind of interesting books that you care about,\n\n00:10:16.958 --> 00:10:18.958\nin languages that you can read.\n\n00:10:18.958 --> 00:10:24.958\nWe actually have been able to do a pretty good job of this, at getting 10 cents a page.\n\n00:10:24.958 --> 00:10:28.958\nSo 10 cents a page, 300 pages in your average book, 30 dollars a book.\n\n00:10:28.958 --> 00:10:32.958\nThe Library of Congress, if you did the whole darn thing --\n\n00:10:32.958 --> 00:10:36.958\n26 million books -- is about 750 million dollars, right?\n\n00:10:36.958 --> 00:10:40.958\nBut a million books, I think, actually would be a pretty good start,\n\n00:10:40.958 --> 00:10:43.958\nand that would cost 30 million dollars. That's not that big a bill.\n\n00:10:43.958 --> 00:10:46.958\nAnd what we've been able to do is get into libraries.\n\n00:10:46.958 --> 00:10:50.958\nWe've now got eight of these scanning centers in three countries,\n\n00:10:50.958 --> 00:10:53.958\nand libraries are up for having their books scanned.\n\n00:10:53.958 --> 00:10:56.958\nThe Getty here is moving their books to the UCLA,\n\n00:10:56.958 --> 00:10:59.958\nwhich is where we have one these scanning centers,\n\n00:10:59.958 --> 00:11:03.958\nand scanning their out-of-copyright books, which is fabulous.\n\n00:11:03.958 --> 00:11:06.958\nSo we're starting to get the institutional responsibility.\n\n00:11:06.958 --> 00:11:09.958\nThe thing we're missing is the 10 cents.\n\n00:11:09.958 --> 00:11:12.958\nIf we can get the 10 cents, all the rest of it flows.\n\n00:11:12.958 --> 00:11:15.958\nWe've scanned about 200,000 books.\n\n00:11:15.958 --> 00:11:18.958\nNow we're scanning about 15,000 books a month,\n\n00:11:18.958 --> 00:11:22.958\nand it's starting to gear up another factor of two from there.\n\n00:11:22.958 --> 00:11:25.958\nSo all in all, that's going very well.\n\n00:11:25.958 --> 00:11:28.958\nAnd we're starting to move out of the just out-of-copyright\n\n00:11:28.958 --> 00:11:30.958\ninto the out-of-print world.\n\n00:11:30.958 --> 00:11:34.958\nSo I think of -- we're kind of going from the out-of-copyright, library stuff,\n\n00:11:34.958 --> 00:11:39.958\nand Amazon.com is coming from the in-print world.\n\n00:11:39.958 --> 00:11:41.958\nAnd I think we'll meet in the middle some place,\n\n00:11:41.958 --> 00:11:43.958\nand have the classic thing that you have,\n\n00:11:43.958 --> 00:11:47.958\nwhich is a publishing system and a library system working in parallel.\n\n00:11:47.958 --> 00:11:53.958\nAnd so we're starting up a program to do out-of-print works, but loaning them.\n\n00:11:53.958 --> 00:11:55.958\nExactly what loaning means, I'm not quite sure.\n\n00:11:55.958 --> 00:12:00.958\nBut anyway, loaning out-of-print works from the Boston Public Library,\n\n00:12:00.958 --> 00:12:04.958\nthe Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute and a few other libraries\n\n00:12:04.958 --> 00:12:06.958\nthat are starting to participate in this program,\n\n00:12:06.958 --> 00:12:09.958\nto try out this model of where does a library stop\n\n00:12:09.958 --> 00:12:12.958\nand where does the bookstore take over.\n\n00:12:12.958 --> 00:12:16.958\nSo all in all, it's possible to do this in large scale.\n\n00:12:16.958 --> 00:12:21.958\nWe're also going back over microfilm and getting that online.\n\n00:12:21.958 --> 00:12:24.958\nSo, we can do 10 cents a page, we're going 15,000 books a month\n\n00:12:24.958 --> 00:12:27.958\nand we've got about 250,000 books online,\n\n00:12:27.958 --> 00:12:29.958\ncounting all the other projects that are starting to add in.\n\n00:12:29.958 --> 00:12:33.958\nSo what I wanted to argue is, books are within our grasp.\n\n00:12:33.958 --> 00:12:39.958\nThe idea of taking on the whole ball of wax is not that big a deal.\n\n00:12:39.958 --> 00:12:43.958\nYes, it costs tens of millions, low hundreds of millions,\n\n00:12:43.958 --> 00:12:50.958\nbut one time shot and we've got basically the history of printed literature online.\n\n00:12:50.958 --> 00:12:52.958\nAnd then, there's business model issues\n\n00:12:52.958 --> 00:12:56.958\nabout how to try to effectively market it and get it to people.\n\n00:12:56.958 --> 00:13:00.958\nBut it is within our grasp, technologically and law-wise,\n\n00:13:00.958 --> 00:13:03.958\nat least for the out of print and out of copyright,\n\n00:13:03.958 --> 00:13:08.958\nwe suggest, to be able to get the whole darn thing online.\n\n00:13:08.958 --> 00:13:11.958\nNow let's go for audio, and I'm going to go through these.\n\n00:13:11.958 --> 00:13:13.958\nSo how much is there?\n\n00:13:13.958 --> 00:13:16.958\nWell, as best we can tell, there are about two to three million disks\n\n00:13:16.958 --> 00:13:21.958\nhaving been published -- so 78s, long-playing records and CDs --\n\n00:13:21.958 --> 00:13:24.958\nor at least that's the largest archives of published materials\n\n00:13:24.958 --> 00:13:26.958\nwe've been able to sort of point at.\n\n00:13:26.958 --> 00:13:30.958\nIt costs about 10 dollars a piece to go and take a disk\n\n00:13:30.958 --> 00:13:34.958\nand put it online, if you're doing things in volume.\n\n00:13:34.958 --> 00:13:37.958\nBut we've found that the rights issues are really quite thorny.\n\n00:13:37.958 --> 00:13:39.958\nThis is a fairly heavily litigated area,\n\n00:13:39.958 --> 00:13:42.958\nso we've found that there are niches in the music world\n\n00:13:42.958 --> 00:13:45.958\nthat aren't served terribly well by the classic commercial publishing system.\n\n00:13:45.958 --> 00:13:49.958\nAnd we've been starting to make these available by going\n\n00:13:49.958 --> 00:13:51.958\nand offering shelf space on the Net.\n\n00:13:51.958 --> 00:13:55.958\nIn the United States, it doesn't cost you to give something away. Right?\n\n00:13:55.958 --> 00:14:02.958\nIf you give something to a charity or to the public,\n\n00:14:02.958 --> 00:14:04.958\nyou get a pat on the back and a tax donation --\n\n00:14:04.958 --> 00:14:06.958\nexcept on the Net, where you can go broke.\n\n00:14:06.958 --> 00:14:11.958\nIf you put up a video of your garage band, and it starts getting heavily accessed,\n\n00:14:11.958 --> 00:14:13.958\nyou can lose your guitars or your house.\n\n00:14:13.958 --> 00:14:15.958\nThis doesn't make any sense.\n\n00:14:15.958 --> 00:14:20.958\nSo we've offered unlimited storage, unlimited bandwidth, forever, for free,\n\n00:14:20.958 --> 00:14:23.958\nto anybody that has something to share that belongs in a library.\n\n00:14:23.958 --> 00:14:27.958\nAnd we've been getting a lot of takers. One is the rock 'n' rollers.\n\n00:14:27.958 --> 00:14:29.958\nThe rock 'n' rollers had a tradition of sharing,\n\n00:14:29.958 --> 00:14:31.958\nas long as nobody made any money. You could --\n\n00:14:31.958 --> 00:14:33.958\nconcert recordings, it's not the commercial recordings,\n\n00:14:33.958 --> 00:14:36.958\nbut concert recordings, started by the Grateful Dead.\n\n00:14:36.958 --> 00:14:39.958\nAnd we get about two or three bands a day signing up.\n\n00:14:39.958 --> 00:14:44.958\nThey give permission, and we get about 40 or 50 concerts a day.\n\n00:14:44.958 --> 00:14:47.958\nWe have about 40,000 concerts, everything the Grateful Dead ever did,\n\n00:14:47.958 --> 00:14:53.958\nup on the Net, so that people can see it and listen to this material.\n\n00:14:53.958 --> 00:14:57.958\nSo audio is possible to put up, but the rights issues are really pretty thorny.\n\n00:14:57.958 --> 00:14:59.958\nWe've got a lot of collections now --\n\n00:14:59.958 --> 00:15:03.958\na couple hundred thousand items -- and it's growing over time.\n\n00:15:03.958 --> 00:15:05.958\nMoving images: if you think of theatrical releases,\n\n00:15:05.958 --> 00:15:07.958\nthere are not that many of them.\n\n00:15:07.958 --> 00:15:11.958\nAs best we can tell, there are about 150,000 to 200,000 movies ever\n\n00:15:11.958 --> 00:15:16.958\nthat are really meant for a large-scale theatrical distribution. It's just not that many.\n\n00:15:16.958 --> 00:15:18.958\nBut half of those were Indian.\n\n00:15:18.958 --> 00:15:20.958\nBut anyway, it's doable,\n\n00:15:20.958 --> 00:15:23.958\nbut we've only found about a thousand of these things that --\n\n00:15:23.958 --> 00:15:25.958\nto be out of copyright.\n\n00:15:25.958 --> 00:15:27.958\nSo we've digitized those and made those available.\n\n00:15:27.958 --> 00:15:29.958\nBut we've found that there's lots of other types of movies\n\n00:15:29.958 --> 00:15:32.958\nthat haven't really seen the light of day -- archival films.\n\n00:15:32.958 --> 00:15:37.958\nWe've found, also, a lot of political films, a lot of amateur films,\n\n00:15:37.958 --> 00:15:42.958\nall sorts of things that are basically needing a home, a permanent home.\n\n00:15:42.958 --> 00:15:46.958\nSo we've been starting to make these available and it's grown to be very popular.\n\n00:15:46.958 --> 00:15:48.958\nWe're not quite a YouTube.\n\n00:15:48.958 --> 00:15:50.958\nWe tended towards longer-term things\n\n00:15:50.958 --> 00:15:54.958\nand also things that people can reuse and make into new movies,\n\n00:15:54.958 --> 00:15:57.958\nwhich has just been great fun.\n\n00:15:57.958 --> 00:15:59.958\nTelevision comes quite a bit larger.\n\n00:15:59.958 --> 00:16:02.958\nWe started recording 20 channels of television 24 hours a day.\n\n00:16:02.958 --> 00:16:06.958\nIt's sort of the biggest TiVo box you've ever seen.\n\n00:16:06.958 --> 00:16:09.958\nIt's about a petabyte, so far, of worldwide television --\n\n00:16:09.958 --> 00:16:14.958\nRussian, Chinese, Japanese, Iraqi, Al Jazeera, BBC, CNN, ABC, CBS, NBC --\n\n00:16:14.958 --> 00:16:16.958\n24 hours a day.\n\n00:16:16.958 --> 00:16:18.958\nWe only put one week up,\n\n00:16:18.958 --> 00:16:23.958\nwhich is mostly for cost reasons, which is the 9/11,\n\n00:16:23.958 --> 00:16:27.958\nsort of from 9/11/2001. For one week, what did the world see?\n\n00:16:27.958 --> 00:16:31.958\nCNN was saying that Palestinians were dancing in the streets.\n\n00:16:31.958 --> 00:16:34.958\nWere they? Let's look at the Palestinian television and find out.\n\n00:16:34.958 --> 00:16:38.958\nHow can we have critical thinking without being able to quote\n\n00:16:38.958 --> 00:16:41.958\nand being able to compare what happened in the past?\n\n00:16:41.958 --> 00:16:45.958\nAnd television is dreadfully unrecorded and unquotable,\n\n00:16:45.958 --> 00:16:49.958\nexcept by Jon Stewart, who does a fabulous job.\n\n00:16:49.958 --> 00:16:53.958\nSo anyway, television is, I would suggest, within our grasp.\n\n00:16:53.958 --> 00:16:58.958\nSo 15 dollars per video hour, and also about 100 dollars to 150 dollars per celluloid hour,\n\n00:16:58.958 --> 00:17:02.958\nwe're able to go and get materials online very inexpensively\n\n00:17:02.958 --> 00:17:04.958\nand have them up on the Net.\n\n00:17:04.958 --> 00:17:06.958\nAnd we've got, now, a lot of these materials.\n\n00:17:06.958 --> 00:17:09.958\nSo we've got about 100,000 pieces up there.\n\n00:17:09.958 --> 00:17:14.958\nSo books, music, video, software. There's only 50,000 titles of it.\n\n00:17:14.958 --> 00:17:20.958\nMostly the issues there are legal issues and breaking copy protections.\n\n00:17:20.958 --> 00:17:22.958\nBut we've worked through some of those,\n\n00:17:22.958 --> 00:17:24.958\nbut we've still got real problems in Washington.\n\n00:17:24.958 --> 00:17:27.958\nWell, we're best known as the World Wide Web.\n\n00:17:27.958 --> 00:17:29.958\nWe've been archiving the World Wide Web since 1996.\n\n00:17:29.958 --> 00:17:35.958\nWe take a snapshot of every website and all of the pages on it, every two months.\n\n00:17:35.958 --> 00:17:39.958\nAnd actually, it's really been pioneered by Alexa Internet,\n\n00:17:39.958 --> 00:17:43.958\nwhich donates this collection to the Internet Archive.\n\n00:17:43.958 --> 00:17:49.958\nAnd it's been growing along for the last 11 years, and it's a fantastic resource.\n\n00:17:49.958 --> 00:17:51.958\nAnd we've made a Wayback Machine\n\n00:17:51.958 --> 00:17:55.958\nthat you can then go and see old websites kind of the way they were.\n\n00:17:55.958 --> 00:17:59.958\nIf you go and search on something -- this is Google.com,\n\n00:17:59.958 --> 00:18:01.958\nthe different versions of it that we have,\n\n00:18:01.958 --> 00:18:03.958\nthis is what it looks like when it was an alpha release,\n\n00:18:03.958 --> 00:18:05.958\nand this is what it looked like at Stanford.\n\n00:18:05.958 --> 00:18:09.958\nSo anyway, you've got basically an idea of where things came from.\n\n00:18:09.958 --> 00:18:12.958\nMostly, people want to see their old stuff out of this.\n\n00:18:12.958 --> 00:18:16.958\nIf there's one thing that we want to learn from the Library of Alexandria version one,\n\n00:18:16.958 --> 00:18:20.958\nwhich is probably best known for burning,\n\n00:18:20.958 --> 00:18:22.958\nis, don't just have one copy.\n\n00:18:22.958 --> 00:18:28.958\nSo we've started to -- we've made another copy of all of this\n\n00:18:28.958 --> 00:18:31.958\nand we actually put it back in the Library of Alexandria.\n\n00:18:31.958 --> 00:18:34.958\nSo this is a picture of the Internet Archive at the Library of Alexandria.\n\n00:18:34.958 --> 00:18:38.958\nAnd we now have also another copy building up in Amsterdam.\n\n00:18:38.958 --> 00:18:42.958\nSo, we should put it in the San Andreas Fault Line in San Francisco,\n\n00:18:42.958 --> 00:18:47.958\nflood zone in Amsterdam and in the Middle East. Right, so anyway ...\n\n00:18:47.958 --> 00:18:50.958\nso we're hedging our bets here.\n\n00:18:50.958 --> 00:18:55.958\nIf we go and put it in a couple more places, I think we'll be in good shape.\n\n00:18:55.958 --> 00:18:57.958\nThere's a political and social question out of this.\n\n00:18:57.958 --> 00:19:01.958\nIs all of this, as we go digital, is it going to be public or private?\n\n00:19:01.958 --> 00:19:03.958\nThere's some large companies that have seen this vision,\n\n00:19:03.958 --> 00:19:05.958\nthat are doing large-scale digitization,\n\n00:19:05.958 --> 00:19:07.958\nbut they're locking up the public domain.\n\n00:19:07.958 --> 00:19:10.958\nThe question is, is that the world that we really want to live in?\n\n00:19:10.958 --> 00:19:14.958\nWhat's the role of the public versus the private as things go forward?\n\n00:19:14.958 --> 00:19:18.958\nHow do we go and have a world where we both have libraries\n\n00:19:18.958 --> 00:19:23.958\nand publishing in the future, just as we basically benefited as we were growing up?\n\n00:19:23.958 --> 00:19:26.958\nSo universal access to all knowledge --\n\n00:19:26.958 --> 00:19:29.958\nI think it can be one of the greatest achievements of humankind,\n\n00:19:29.958 --> 00:19:33.958\nlike the man on the moon, or the Gutenberg Bible, or the Library of Alexandria.\n\n00:19:33.958 --> 00:19:35.958\nIt could be something that we're remembered for,\n\n00:19:35.958 --> 00:19:38.958\nfor millennia, for having achieved.\n\n00:19:38.958 --> 00:19:40.958\nAnd as I said before, I'll end with something\n\n00:19:40.958 --> 00:19:43.958\nthat's carved above the door of the Carnegie Library.\n\n00:19:43.958 --> 00:19:45.958\nCarnegie -- one of the great capitalists of this country --\n\n00:19:45.958 --> 00:19:49.958\ncarved above his legacy, \"Free to the People.\"\n\n00:19:49.958 --> 00:19:51.958\nThank you very much."}, {"title": "Life in the deep oceans", "duration": "800", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/david_gallo_on_life_in_the_deep_oceans", "transcript": "(Applause) David Gallo: This is Bill Lange. I'm Dave Gallo. And we're going to tell you some stories from the sea here in video. We've got some of the most incredible video of Titanic that's ever been seen, and we're not going to show you any of it. (Laughter)The truth of the matter is that the Titanic \u2014 even though it's breaking all sorts of box office records \u2014 it's not the most exciting story from the sea. And the problem, I think, is that we take the ocean for granted. When you think about it, the oceans are 75 percent of the planet. Most of the planet is ocean water. The average depth is about two miles. Part of the problem, I think, is we stand at the beach, or we see images like this of the ocean, and you look out at this great big blue expanse, and it's shimmering and it's moving and there's waves and there's surf and there's tides, but you have no idea for what lies in there. And in the oceans, there are the longest mountain ranges on the planet. Most of the animals are in the oceans. Most of the earthquakes and volcanoes are in the sea, at the bottom of the sea. The biodiversity and the biodensity in the ocean is higher, in places, than it is in the rainforests. It's mostly unexplored, and yet there are beautiful sights like this that captivate us and make us become familiar with it.But when you're standing at the beach, I want you to think that you're standing at the edge of a very unfamiliar world. We have to have a very special technology to get into that unfamiliar world. We use the submarine Alvin and we use cameras, and the cameras are something that Bill Lange has developed with the help of Sony. Marcel Proust said, \"The true voyage of discovery is not so much in seeking new landscapes as in having new eyes.\" People that have partnered with us have given us new eyes, not only on what exists \u2014 the new landscapes at the bottom of the sea \u2014 but also how we think about life on the planet itself.Here's a jelly. It's one of my favorites, because it's got all sorts of working parts. This turns out to be the longest creature in the oceans. It gets up to about 150 feet long. But see all those different working things? I love that kind of stuff. It's got these fishing lures on the bottom. They're going up and down. It's got tentacles dangling, swirling around like that. It's a colonial animal. These are all individual animals banding together to make this one creature. And it's got these jet thrusters up in front that it'll use in a moment, and a little light. If you take all the big fish and schooling fish and all that, put them on one side of the scale, put all the jelly-type of animals on the other side, those guys win hands down.Most of the biomass in the ocean is made out of creatures like this. Here's the X-wing death jelly. (Laughter) The bioluminescence \u2014 they use the lights for attracting mates and attracting prey and communicating. We couldn't begin to show you our archival stuff from the jellies. They come in all different sizes and shapes.Bill Lange: We tend to forget about the fact that the ocean is miles deep on average, and that we're real familiar with the animals that are in the first 200 or 300 feet, but we're not familiar with what exists from there all the way down to the bottom. And these are the types of animals that live in that three-dimensional space, that micro-gravity environment that we really haven't explored. You hear about giant squid and things like that, but some of these animals get up to be approximately 140, 160 feet long. They're very little understood.DG: This is one of them, another one of our favorites, because it's a little octopod. You can actually see through his head. And here he is, flapping with his ears and very gracefully going up. We see those at all depths and even at the greatest depths. They go from a couple of inches to a couple of feet. They come right up to the submarine \u2014 they'll put their eyes right up to the window and peek inside the sub.This is really a world within a world, and we're going to show you two. In this case, we're passing down through the mid-ocean and we see creatures like this. This is kind of like an undersea rooster. This guy, that looks incredibly formal, in a way. And then one of my favorites. What a face! This is basically scientific data that you're looking at. It's footage that we've collected for scientific purposes. And that's one of the things that Bill's been doing, is providing scientists with this first view of animals like this, in the world where they belong. They don't catch them in a net. They're actually looking at them down in that world. We're going to take a joystick, sit in front of our computer, on the Earth, and press the joystick forward, and fly around the planet.We're going to look at the mid-ocean ridge, a 40,000-mile long mountain range. The average depth at the top of it is about a mile and a half. And we're over the Atlantic \u2014 that's the ridge right there \u2014 but we're going to go across the Caribbean, Central America, and end up against the Pacific, nine degrees north. We make maps of these mountain ranges with sound, with sonar, and this is one of those mountain ranges. We're coming around a cliff here on the right. The height of these mountains on either side of this valley is greater than the Alps in most cases. And there's tens of thousands of those mountains out there that haven't been mapped yet.This is a volcanic ridge. We're getting down further and further in scale. And eventually, we can come up with something like this.This is an icon of our robot, Jason, it's called. And you can sit in a room like this, with a joystick and a headset, and drive a robot like that around the bottom of the ocean in real time. One of the things we're trying to do at Woods Hole with our partners is to bring this virtual world \u2014 this world, this unexplored region \u2014 back to the laboratory. Because we see it in bits and pieces right now. We see it either as sound, or we see it as video, or we see it as photographs, or we see it as chemical sensors, but we never have yet put it all together into one interesting picture.Here's where Bill's cameras really do shine. This is what's called a hydrothermal vent. And what you're seeing here is a cloud of densely packed, hydrogen-sulfide-rich water coming out of a volcanic axis on the sea floor. Gets up to 600, 700 degrees F, somewhere in that range. So that's all water under the sea \u2014 a mile and a half, two miles, three miles down. And we knew it was volcanic back in the '60s, '70s. And then we had some hint that these things existed all along the axis of it, because if you've got volcanism, water's going to get down from the sea into cracks in the sea floor, come in contact with magma, and come shooting out hot. We weren't really aware that it would be so rich with sulfides, hydrogen sulfides. We didn't have any idea about these things, which we call chimneys.This is one of these hydrothermal vents. Six hundred degree F water coming out of the Earth. On either side of us are mountain ranges that are higher than the Alps, so the setting here is very dramatic.BL: The white material is a type of bacteria that thrives at 180 degrees C.DG: I think that's one of the greatest stories right now that we're seeing from the bottom of the sea, is that the first thing we see coming out of the sea floor after a volcanic eruption is bacteria. And we started to wonder for a long time, how did it all get down there? What we find out now is that it's probably coming from inside the Earth. Not only is it coming out of the Earth \u2014 so, biogenesis made from volcanic activity \u2014 but that bacteria supports these colonies of life. The pressure here is 4,000 pounds per square inch. A mile and a half from the surface to two miles to three miles \u2014 no sun has ever gotten down here. All the energy to support these life forms is coming from inside the Earth \u2014 so, chemosynthesis. And you can see how dense the population is. These are called tube worms.BL: These worms have no digestive system. They have no mouth. But they have two types of gill structures. One for extracting oxygen out of the deep-sea water, another one which houses this chemosynthetic bacteria, which takes the hydrothermal fluid \u2014 that hot water that you saw coming out of the bottom \u2014 and converts that into simple sugars that the tube worm can digest.DG: You can see, here's a crab that lives down there. He's managed to grab a tip of these worms. Now, they normally retract as soon as a crab touches them. Oh! Good going. So, as soon as a crab touches them, they retract down into their shells, just like your fingernails. There's a whole story being played out here that we're just now beginning to have some idea of because of this new camera technology.BL: These worms live in a real temperature extreme. Their foot is at about 200 degrees C and their head is out at three degrees C, so it's like having your hand in boiling water and your foot in freezing water. That's how they like to live. (Laughter)DG: This is a female of this kind of worm. And here's a male. You watch. It doesn't take long before two guys here \u2014 this one and one that will show up over here \u2014 start to fight. Everything you see is played out in the pitch black of the deep sea. There are never any lights there, except the lights that we bring. Here they go. On one of the last dive series, we counted 200 species in these areas \u2014 198 were new, new species.BL: One of the big problems is that for the biologists working at these sites, it's rather difficult to collect these animals. And they disintegrate on the way up, so the imagery is critical for the science.DG: Two octopods at about two miles depth. This pressure thing really amazes me \u2014 that these animals can exist there at a depth with pressure enough to crush the Titanic like an empty Pepsi can. What we saw up till now was from the Pacific. This is from the Atlantic. Even greater depth. You can see this shrimp is harassing this poor little guy here, and he'll bat it away with his claw. Whack! (Laughter)And the same thing's going on over here. What they're getting at is that \u2014 on the back of this crab \u2014 the foodstuff here is this very strange bacteria that lives on the backs of all these animals. And what these shrimp are trying to do is actually harvest the bacteria from the backs of these animals. And the crabs don't like it at all. These long filaments that you see on the back of the crab are actually created by the product of that bacteria. So, the bacteria grows hair on the crab. On the back, you see this again. The red dot is the laser light of the submarine Alvin to give us an idea about how far away we are from the vents. Those are all shrimp. You see the hot water over here, here and here, coming out. They're clinging to a rock face and actually scraping bacteria off that rock face. Here's a tiny, little vent that's come out of the side of that pillar. Those pillars get up to several stories. So here, you've got this valley with this incredible alien landscape of pillars and hot springs and volcanic eruptions and earthquakes, inhabited by these very strange animals that live only on chemical energy coming out of the ground. They don't need the sun at all.BL: You see this white V-shaped mark on the back of the shrimp? It's actually a light-sensing organ. It's how they find the hydrothermal vents. The vents are emitting a black body radiation \u2014 an IR signature \u2014 and so they're able to find these vents at considerable distances.DG: All this stuff is happening along that 40,000-mile long mountain range that we're calling the ribbon of life, because just even today, as we speak, there's life being generated there from volcanic activity. This is the first time we've ever tried this any place. We're going to try to show you high definition from the Pacific. We're moving up one of these pillars. This one's several stories tall. In it, you'll see that it's a habitat for a lot of different animals. There's a funny kind of hot plate here, with vent water coming out of it. So all of these are individual homes for worms.Now here's a closer view of that community. Here's crabs here, worms here. There are smaller animals crawling around. Here's pagoda structures. I think this is the neatest-looking thing. I just can't get over this \u2014 that you've got these little chimneys sitting here smoking away. This stuff is toxic as hell, by the way. You could never get a permit to dump this in the ocean, and it's coming out all from it. (Laughter) It's unbelievable. It's basically sulfuric acid, and it's being just dumped out, at incredible rates. And animals are thriving \u2014 and we probably came from here. That's probably where we evolved from.BL: This bacteria that we've been talking about turns out to be the most simplest form of life found. There are a number of groups that are proposing that life evolved at these vent sites. Although the vent sites are short-lived \u2014 an individual site may last only 10 years or so \u2014 as an ecosystem they've been stable for millions \u2014 well, billions \u2014 of years.DG: It works too well. You see there're some fish inside here as well. There's a fish sitting here. Here's a crab with his claw right at the end of that tube worm, waiting for that worm to stick his head out. (Laughter)BL: The biologists right now cannot explain why these animals are so active. The worms are growing inches per week!DG: I already said that this site, from a human perspective, is toxic as hell. Not only that, but on top \u2014 the lifeblood \u2014 that plumbing system turns off every year or so. Their plumbing system turns off, so the sites have to move. And then there's earthquakes, and then volcanic eruptions, on the order of one every five years, that completely wipes the area out. Despite that, these animals grow back in about a year's time. You're talking about biodensities and biodiversity, again, higher than the rainforest that just springs back to life. Is it sensitive? Yes. Is it fragile? No, it's not really very fragile.I'll end up with saying one thing. There's a story in the sea, in the waters of the sea, in the sediments and the rocks of the sea floor. It's an incredible story. What we see when we look back in time, in those sediments and rocks, is a record of Earth history. Everything on this planet \u2014 everything \u2014 works by cycles and rhythms. The continents move apart. They come back together. Oceans come and go. Mountains come and go. Glaciers come and go. El Nino comes and goes. It's not a disaster, it's rhythmic. What we're learning now, it's almost like a symphony. It's just like music \u2014 it really is just like music. And what we're learning now is that you can't listen to a five-billion-year long symphony, get to today and say, \"Stop! We want tomorrow's note to be the same as it was today.\" It's absurd. It's just absurd. So, what we've got to learn now is to find out where this planet's going at all these different scales and work with it. Learn to manage it. The concept of preservation is futile. Conservation's tougher, but we can probably get there. Thank you very much. Thank you.

I'm Dave Gallo.\n\n00:00:15.958 --> 00:00:18.958\nAnd we're going to tell you some stories from the sea here in video.\n\n00:00:18.958 --> 00:00:23.958\nWe've got some of the most incredible video of Titanic that's ever been seen,\n\n00:00:23.958 --> 00:00:26.958\nand we're not going to show you any of it.\n\n00:00:26.958 --> 00:00:29.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:00:29.958 --> 00:00:31.958\nThe truth of the matter is that the Titanic --\n\n00:00:31.958 --> 00:00:33.958\neven though it's breaking all sorts of box office records --\n\n00:00:33.958 --> 00:00:37.958\nit's not the most exciting story from the sea.\n\n00:00:37.958 --> 00:00:40.958\nAnd the problem, I think, is that we take the ocean for granted.\n\n00:00:40.958 --> 00:00:42.958\nWhen you think about it, the oceans are 75 percent of the planet.\n\n00:00:42.958 --> 00:00:44.958\nMost of the planet is ocean water.\n\n00:00:44.958 --> 00:00:46.958\nThe average depth is about two miles.\n\n00:00:46.958 --> 00:00:48.958\nPart of the problem, I think, is we stand at the beach,\n\n00:00:48.958 --> 00:00:51.958\nor we see images like this of the ocean,\n\n00:00:51.958 --> 00:00:55.958\nand you look out at this great big blue expanse, and it's shimmering\n\n00:00:55.958 --> 00:00:58.958\nand it's moving and there's waves and there's surf and there's tides,\n\n00:00:58.958 --> 00:01:00.958\nbut you have no idea for what lies in there.\n\n00:01:00.958 --> 00:01:02.958\nAnd in the oceans, there are the longest mountain ranges on the planet.\n\n00:01:02.958 --> 00:01:04.958\nMost of the animals are in the oceans.\n\n00:01:04.958 --> 00:01:06.958\nMost of the earthquakes and volcanoes are in the sea,\n\n00:01:06.958 --> 00:01:08.958\nat the bottom of the sea.\n\n00:01:08.958 --> 00:01:11.958\nThe biodiversity and the biodensity in the ocean is higher, in places,\n\n00:01:11.958 --> 00:01:13.958\nthan it is in the rainforests.\n\n00:01:13.958 --> 00:01:15.958\nIt's mostly unexplored, and yet there are beautiful sights like this\n\n00:01:15.958 --> 00:01:18.958\nthat captivate us and make us become familiar with it.\n\n00:01:18.958 --> 00:01:20.958\nBut when you're standing at the beach, I want you to think\n\n00:01:20.958 --> 00:01:22.958\nthat you're standing at the edge of a very unfamiliar world.\n\n00:01:22.958 --> 00:01:24.958\nWe have to have a very special technology\n\n00:01:24.958 --> 00:01:26.958\nto get into that unfamiliar world.\n\n00:01:26.958 --> 00:01:29.958\nWe use the submarine Alvin and we use cameras,\n\n00:01:29.958 --> 00:01:33.958\nand the cameras are something that Bill Lange has developed with the help of Sony.\n\n00:01:33.958 --> 00:01:35.958\nMarcel Proust said, \"The true voyage of discovery\n\n00:01:35.958 --> 00:01:40.958\nis not so much in seeking new landscapes as in having new eyes.\"\n\n00:01:40.958 --> 00:01:42.958\nPeople that have partnered with us have given us new eyes,\n\n00:01:42.958 --> 00:01:44.958\nnot only on what exists --\n\n00:01:44.958 --> 00:01:46.958\nthe new landscapes at the bottom of the sea --\n\n00:01:46.958 --> 00:01:48.958\nbut also how we think about life on the planet itself.\n\n00:01:48.958 --> 00:01:50.958\nHere's a jelly.\n\n00:01:50.958 --> 00:01:52.958\nIt's one of my favorites, because it's got all sorts of working parts.\n\n00:01:52.958 --> 00:01:54.958\nThis turns out to be the longest creature in the oceans.\n\n00:01:54.958 --> 00:01:57.958\nIt gets up to about 150 feet long.\n\n00:01:57.958 --> 00:01:59.958\nBut see all those different working things?\n\n00:01:59.958 --> 00:02:01.958\nI love that kind of stuff.\n\n00:02:01.958 --> 00:02:03.958\nIt's got these fishing lures on the bottom. They're going up and down.\n\n00:02:03.958 --> 00:02:04.958\nIt's got tentacles dangling, swirling around like that.\n\n00:02:04.958 --> 00:02:06.958\nIt's a colonial animal.\n\n00:02:06.958 --> 00:02:08.958\nThese are all individual animals\n\n00:02:08.958 --> 00:02:10.958\nbanding together to make this one creature.\n\n00:02:10.958 --> 00:02:12.958\nAnd it's got these jet thrusters up in front\n\n00:02:12.958 --> 00:02:14.958\nthat it'll use in a moment, and a little light.\n\n00:02:16.958 --> 00:02:19.958\nIf you take all the big fish and schooling fish and all that,\n\n00:02:19.958 --> 00:02:21.958\nput them on one side of the scale, put all the jelly-type of animals\n\n00:02:21.958 --> 00:02:25.958\non the other side, those guys win hands down.\n\n00:02:25.958 --> 00:02:27.958\nMost of the biomass in the ocean is made out of creatures like this.\n\n00:02:27.958 --> 00:02:29.958\nHere's the X-wing death jelly.\n\n00:02:29.958 --> 00:02:33.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:02:33.958 --> 00:02:36.958\nThe bioluminescence -- they use the lights for attracting mates\n\n00:02:36.958 --> 00:02:38.958\nand attracting prey and communicating.\n\n00:02:38.958 --> 00:02:42.958\nWe couldn't begin to show you our archival stuff from the jellies.\n\n00:02:42.958 --> 00:02:44.958\nThey come in all different sizes and shapes.\n\n00:02:44.958 --> 00:02:48.958\nBill Lange: We tend to forget about the fact that the ocean is miles deep\n\n00:02:48.958 --> 00:02:51.958\non average, and that we're real familiar with the animals\n\n00:02:51.958 --> 00:02:55.958\nthat are in the first 200 or 300 feet, but we're not familiar\n\n00:02:55.958 --> 00:02:58.958\nwith what exists from there all the way down to the bottom.\n\n00:02:58.958 --> 00:03:00.958\nAnd these are the types of animals\n\n00:03:00.958 --> 00:03:02.958\nthat live in that three-dimensional space,\n\n00:03:02.958 --> 00:03:05.958\nthat micro-gravity environment that we really haven't explored.\n\n00:03:05.958 --> 00:03:08.958\nYou hear about giant squid and things like that,\n\n00:03:08.958 --> 00:03:12.958\nbut some of these animals get up to be approximately 140, 160 feet long.\n\n00:03:12.958 --> 00:03:14.958\nThey're very little understood.\n\n00:03:14.958 --> 00:03:17.958\nDG: This is one of them, another one of our favorites, because it's a little octopod.\n\n00:03:17.958 --> 00:03:19.958\nYou can actually see through his head.\n\n00:03:19.958 --> 00:03:21.958\nAnd here he is, flapping with his ears and very gracefully going up.\n\n00:03:21.958 --> 00:03:24.958\nWe see those at all depths and even at the greatest depths.\n\n00:03:24.958 --> 00:03:26.958\nThey go from a couple of inches to a couple of feet.\n\n00:03:26.958 --> 00:03:28.958\nThey come right up to the submarine --\n\n00:03:28.958 --> 00:03:30.958\nthey'll put their eyes right up to the window and peek inside the sub.\n\n00:03:30.958 --> 00:03:32.958\nThis is really a world within a world,\n\n00:03:32.958 --> 00:03:34.958\nand we're going to show you two.\n\n00:03:34.958 --> 00:03:37.958\nIn this case, we're passing down through the mid-ocean and we see creatures like this.\n\n00:03:37.958 --> 00:03:39.958\nThis is kind of like an undersea rooster.\n\n00:03:39.958 --> 00:03:41.958\nThis guy, that looks incredibly formal, in a way.\n\n00:03:42.958 --> 00:03:45.958\nAnd then one of my favorites. What a face!\n\n00:03:46.958 --> 00:03:49.958\nThis is basically scientific data that you're looking at.\n\n00:03:49.958 --> 00:03:51.958\nIt's footage that we've collected for scientific purposes.\n\n00:03:51.958 --> 00:03:53.958\nAnd that's one of the things that Bill's been doing,\n\n00:03:53.958 --> 00:03:55.958\nis providing scientists with this first view of animals like this,\n\n00:03:55.958 --> 00:03:57.958\nin the world where they belong.\n\n00:03:57.958 --> 00:03:59.958\nThey don't catch them in a net.\n\n00:03:59.958 --> 00:04:01.958\nThey're actually looking at them down in that world.\n\n00:04:01.958 --> 00:04:03.958\nWe're going to take a joystick,\n\n00:04:03.958 --> 00:04:05.958\nsit in front of our computer, on the Earth,\n\n00:04:05.958 --> 00:04:07.958\nand press the joystick forward, and fly around the planet.\n\n00:04:07.958 --> 00:04:09.958\nWe're going to look at the mid-ocean ridge,\n\n00:04:09.958 --> 00:04:11.958\na 40,000-mile long mountain range.\n\n00:04:11.958 --> 00:04:13.958\nThe average depth at the top of it is about a mile and a half.\n\n00:04:13.958 --> 00:04:15.958\nAnd we're over the Atlantic -- that's the ridge right there --\n\n00:04:15.958 --> 00:04:18.958\nbut we're going to go across the Caribbean, Central America,\n\n00:04:18.958 --> 00:04:21.958\nand end up against the Pacific, nine degrees north.\n\n00:04:21.958 --> 00:04:24.958\nWe make maps of these mountain ranges with sound, with sonar,\n\n00:04:24.958 --> 00:04:26.958\nand this is one of those mountain ranges.\n\n00:04:26.958 --> 00:04:28.958\nWe're coming around a cliff here on the right.\n\n00:04:28.958 --> 00:04:30.958\nThe height of these mountains on either side of this valley\n\n00:04:30.958 --> 00:04:32.958\nis greater than the Alps in most cases.\n\n00:04:32.958 --> 00:04:35.958\nAnd there's tens of thousands of those mountains out there that haven't been mapped yet.\n\n00:04:35.958 --> 00:04:37.958\nThis is a volcanic ridge.\n\n00:04:37.958 --> 00:04:39.958\nWe're getting down further and further in scale.\n\n00:04:39.958 --> 00:04:41.958\nAnd eventually, we can come up with something like this.\n\n00:04:41.958 --> 00:04:44.958\nThis is an icon of our robot, Jason, it's called.\n\n00:04:44.958 --> 00:04:46.958\nAnd you can sit in a room like this,\n\n00:04:46.958 --> 00:04:49.958\nwith a joystick and a headset, and drive a robot like that\n\n00:04:49.958 --> 00:04:51.958\naround the bottom of the ocean in real time.\n\n00:04:51.958 --> 00:04:54.958\nOne of the things we're trying to do at Woods Hole with our partners\n\n00:04:54.958 --> 00:04:56.958\nis to bring this virtual world --\n\n00:04:56.958 --> 00:04:59.958\nthis world, this unexplored region -- back to the laboratory.\n\n00:04:59.958 --> 00:05:01.958\nBecause we see it in bits and pieces right now.\n\n00:05:01.958 --> 00:05:04.958\nWe see it either as sound, or we see it as video,\n\n00:05:04.958 --> 00:05:06.958\nor we see it as photographs, or we see it as chemical sensors,\n\n00:05:06.958 --> 00:05:10.958\nbut we never have yet put it all together into one interesting picture.\n\n00:05:10.958 --> 00:05:12.958\nHere's where Bill's cameras really do shine.\n\n00:05:12.958 --> 00:05:14.958\nThis is what's called a hydrothermal vent.\n\n00:05:14.958 --> 00:05:17.958\nAnd what you're seeing here is a cloud of densely packed,\n\n00:05:17.958 --> 00:05:19.958\nhydrogen-sulfide-rich water\n\n00:05:19.958 --> 00:05:23.958\ncoming out of a volcanic axis on the sea floor.\n\n00:05:23.958 --> 00:05:26.958\nGets up to 600, 700 degrees F, somewhere in that range.\n\n00:05:26.958 --> 00:05:28.958\nSo that's all water under the sea --\n\n00:05:28.958 --> 00:05:30.958\na mile and a half, two miles, three miles down.\n\n00:05:30.958 --> 00:05:33.958\nAnd we knew it was volcanic back in the '60s, '70s.\n\n00:05:33.958 --> 00:05:36.958\nAnd then we had some hint that these things existed\n\n00:05:36.958 --> 00:05:38.958\nall along the axis of it, because if you've got volcanism,\n\n00:05:38.958 --> 00:05:42.958\nwater's going to get down from the sea into cracks in the sea floor,\n\n00:05:42.958 --> 00:05:45.958\ncome in contact with magma, and come shooting out hot.\n\n00:05:45.958 --> 00:05:50.958\nWe weren't really aware that it would be so rich with sulfides, hydrogen sulfides.\n\n00:05:50.958 --> 00:05:53.958\nWe didn't have any idea about these things, which we call chimneys.\n\n00:05:53.958 --> 00:05:55.958\nThis is one of these hydrothermal vents.\n\n00:05:55.958 --> 00:05:58.958\nSix hundred degree F water coming out of the Earth.\n\n00:05:58.958 --> 00:06:02.958\nOn either side of us are mountain ranges that are higher than the Alps,\n\n00:06:02.958 --> 00:06:04.958\nso the setting here is very dramatic.\n\n00:06:04.958 --> 00:06:06.958\nBL: The white material is a type of bacteria\n\n00:06:06.958 --> 00:06:09.958\nthat thrives at 180 degrees C.\n\n00:06:09.958 --> 00:06:11.958\nDG: I think that's one of the greatest stories right now\n\n00:06:11.958 --> 00:06:13.958\nthat we're seeing from the bottom of the sea,\n\n00:06:13.958 --> 00:06:15.958\nis that the first thing we see coming out of the sea floor\n\n00:06:15.958 --> 00:06:17.958\nafter a volcanic eruption is bacteria.\n\n00:06:17.958 --> 00:06:19.958\nAnd we started to wonder for a long time,\n\n00:06:19.958 --> 00:06:21.958\nhow did it all get down there?\n\n00:06:21.958 --> 00:06:24.958\nWhat we find out now is that it's probably coming from inside the Earth.\n\n00:06:24.958 --> 00:06:26.958\nNot only is it coming out of the Earth --\n\n00:06:26.958 --> 00:06:28.958\nso, biogenesis made from volcanic activity --\n\n00:06:28.958 --> 00:06:31.958\nbut that bacteria supports these colonies of life.\n\n00:06:31.958 --> 00:06:35.958\nThe pressure here is 4,000 pounds per square inch.\n\n00:06:35.958 --> 00:06:37.958\nA mile and a half from the surface to two miles to three miles --\n\n00:06:37.958 --> 00:06:40.958\nno sun has ever gotten down here.\n\n00:06:40.958 --> 00:06:42.958\nAll the energy to support these life forms\n\n00:06:42.958 --> 00:06:45.958\nis coming from inside the Earth -- so, chemosynthesis.\n\n00:06:45.958 --> 00:06:47.958\nAnd you can see how dense the population is.\n\n00:06:47.958 --> 00:06:49.958\nThese are called tube worms.\n\n00:06:49.958 --> 00:06:52.958\nBL: These worms have no digestive system. They have no mouth.\n\n00:06:52.958 --> 00:06:54.958\nBut they have two types of gill structures.\n\n00:06:54.958 --> 00:06:57.958\nOne for extracting oxygen out of the deep-sea water,\n\n00:06:57.958 --> 00:07:01.958\nanother one which houses this chemosynthetic bacteria,\n\n00:07:01.958 --> 00:07:04.958\nwhich takes the hydrothermal fluid --\n\n00:07:04.958 --> 00:07:07.958\nthat hot water that you saw coming out of the bottom --\n\n00:07:07.958 --> 00:07:12.958\nand converts that into simple sugars that the tube worm can digest.\n\n00:07:12.958 --> 00:07:14.958\nDG: You can see, here's a crab that lives down there.\n\n00:07:14.958 --> 00:07:16.958\nHe's managed to grab a tip of these worms.\n\n00:07:16.958 --> 00:07:18.958\nNow, they normally retract as soon as a crab touches them.\n\n00:07:18.958 --> 00:07:20.958\nOh! Good going.\n\n00:07:20.958 --> 00:07:22.958\nSo, as soon as a crab touches them,\n\n00:07:22.958 --> 00:07:24.958\nthey retract down into their shells, just like your fingernails.\n\n00:07:24.958 --> 00:07:26.958\nThere's a whole story being played out here\n\n00:07:26.958 --> 00:07:28.958\nthat we're just now beginning to have some idea of\n\n00:07:28.958 --> 00:07:30.958\nbecause of this new camera technology.\n\n00:07:30.958 --> 00:07:33.958\nBL: These worms live in a real temperature extreme.\n\n00:07:33.958 --> 00:07:37.958\nTheir foot is at about 200 degrees C\n\n00:07:37.958 --> 00:07:40.958\nand their head is out at three degrees C,\n\n00:07:40.958 --> 00:07:44.958\nso it's like having your hand in boiling water and your foot in freezing water.\n\n00:07:44.958 --> 00:07:46.958\nThat's how they like to live.\n\n00:07:46.958 --> 00:07:48.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:07:48.958 --> 00:07:50.958\nDG: This is a female of this kind of worm.\n\n00:07:50.958 --> 00:07:52.958\nAnd here's a male.\n\n00:07:52.958 --> 00:07:55.958\nYou watch.

Four feet. Nothing larger than the sum of her figurative parts. You still with me? (Laughter) I called her up. \"Hello, how're you doing, baby?\" \"Hey, ma, I got to talk to you.\" \"You're talking to me already. What's the matter?\" I said, \"I've got to talk to a bunch of nice people.\" \"You're always talking to nice people, except when you went to the White House.\" \"Ma, don't start!\" And I told her I was coming to TED, and she said, \"What's the problem?\" And I said, \"Well, I'm not sure.\" I said, \"I have to talk to them about stories. It's 'Technology, Entertainment and Design.'\" And she said, \"Well, you design a story when you make it up, it's entertainment when you tell it, and you're going to use a microphone.\" (Laughter) I said, \"You're a peach, ma. Pop there?\" \"What's the matter? The pearls of wisdom leaping from my lips like lemmings is no good for you?\" (Laughter) Then my pop got on there. My pop, he's one of the old souls, you know \u2014 old Cuban man from Camaguey. Camaguey is a province in Cuba. He's from Florida. He was born there in 1924. He grew up in a bohio of dirt floors, and the structure was the kind used by the Tainos, our old Arawak ancestors. My father is at once quick-witted, wickedly funny, and then poignancy turns on a dime and leaves you breathless. \"Papi, help.\" \"I already heard your mother. I think she's right.\" (Laughter) \"After what I just told you?\" My whole life, my father's been there. So we talked for a few minutes, and he said, \"Why don't you tell them what you believe?\" I love that, but we don't have the time. Good storytelling is crafting a story that someone wants to listen to. Great story is the art of letting go. So I'm going to tell you a little story. Remember, this tradition comes to us not from the mists of Avalon, back in time, but further still, before we were scratching out these stories on papyrus, or we were doing the pictographs on walls in moist, damp caves. Back then, we had an urge, a need, to tell the story. When Lexus wants to sell you a car, they're telling you a story. Have you been watching the commercials? Because every one of us has this desire, for once \u2014 just once \u2014 to tell our story and have it heard. There are stories you tell from stages. There's stories that you may tell in a small group of people with some good wine. And there's stories you tell late at night to a friend, maybe once in your life. And then there are stories that we whisper into a Stygian darkness. I'm not telling you that story. I'm telling you this one. It's called, \"You're Going to Miss Me.\" It's about human connection. My Cuban mother, which I just briefly introduced you to in that short character sketch, came to the United States one thousand years ago. I was born in 19 \u2014 I forget, and I came to this country with them in the aftermath of the Cuban revolution. We went from Havana, Cuba to Decatur, Georgia. And Decatur, Georgia's a small Southern town. And in that little Southern town, I grew up, and grew up hearing these stories. But this story only happened a few years ago. I called my mom. It was a Saturday morning. And I was calling about how to make ajiaco. It's a Cuban meal. It's delicious. It's savory. It makes spit froth in the little corners of your mouth \u2014 is that enough? It makes your armpits juicy, you know? That kind of food, yeah. This is the sensory part of the program, people. I called my mother, and she said, \"Carmen, I need you to come, please. I need to go to the mall, and you know your father now, he takes a nap in the afternoon, and I got to go. I got an errand to run.\" Let me parenthetically pause here and tell you \u2014 Esther, my mother, had stopped driving several years ago, to the collective relief of the entire city of Atlanta. Any vehicular outing with that woman from the time I was a young child, guys, naturally included flashing, blue lights. But she'd become adept at dodging the boys in blue, and when she did meet them, oh, she had wonderful, well, rapport. \"Ma'am, did you know that was a light you just ran?\" (Spanish) \"You don't speak English?\" \"No.\" (Laughter) But eventually, every dog has its day, and she ended up in traffic court, where she bartered with the judge for a discount. There's a historical marker. But now she was a septuagenarian, she'd stopped driving. And that meant that everyone in the family had to sign up to take her to have her hair dyed, you know, that peculiar color of blue that matches her polyester pants suit, you know, same color as the Buick. Anybody? All right. Little picks on the legs, where she does her needlepoint, and leaves little loops. Rockports \u2014 they're for this. That's why they call them that. (Laughter) This is her ensemble. And this is the woman that wants me to come on a Saturday morning when I have a lot to do, but it doesn't take long because Cuban guilt is a weighty thing. I'm not going political on you but ... And so, I go to my mother's. I show up. She's in the carport. Of course, they have a carport. The kind with the corrugated roof, you know. The Buick's parked outside, and she's jingling, jangling a pair of keys. \"I got a surprise for you, baby!\" \"We taking your car?\" \"Not we, I.\" And she reaches into her pocket and pulls out a catastrophe. Somebody's storytelling. Interactive art. You can talk to me. Oh, a driver's license, a perfectly valid driver's license. Issued, evidently, by the DMV in her own county of Gwinnett. Blithering fucking idiots. (Laughter) I said, \"Is that thing real?\" \"I think so.\" \"Can you even see?\" \"I guess I must.\" \"Oh, Jesus.\" She gets into the car \u2014 she's sitting on two phone books. I can't even make this part up because she's that tiny. She's engineered an umbrella so she can \u2014 bam! \u2014 slam the door. Her daughter, me, the village idiot with the ice cream cone in the middle of her forehead, is still standing there, slack-jawed. \"You coming? You no coming?\" \"Oh, my God.\" I said, \"OK, fine. Does pop know you're driving?\" \"Are you kidding me?\" \"How are you doing it?\" \"He's got to sleep sometime.\" And so we left my father fast asleep, because I knew he'd kill me if I let her go by herself, and we get in the car. Puts it in reverse. Fifty-five out of the driveway, in reverse. I am buckling in seatbelts from the front. I'm yanking them in from the back. I'm doing double knots. I mean, I've got a mouth as dry as the Kalahari Desert. I've got a white-knuckle grip on the door. You know what I'm talking about? And she's whistling, and finally I do the kind of birth breathing \u2014 you know, that one? Only a couple of women are going uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh. Right. And I said, \"Ma, would you slow down?\" Because now she's picked up the Highway 285, the perimeter around Atlanta, which encompasses now \u2014 there's seven lanes, she's on all of them, y'all. I said, \"Ma, pick a lane!\" \"They give you seven lanes, they expect you to use them.\" And there she goes, right. I don't believe for a minute she has been out and not been stopped. So, I think, hey, we can talk. It'll be a diversion. It'll help my breathing. It'll do something for my pulse, maybe. \"Mommy, I know you have been stopped.\" \"No, no, what you talking about?\" \"You have a license. How long have you been driving?\" \"Four or five days.\" \"Yeah. And you haven't been stopped?\" \"I did not get a ticket.\" I said, \"Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, but come on, come on, come on.\" \"OK, so I stopped at a light and there's a guy, you know, in the back.\" \"Would this guy have, like, a blue uniform and a terrified look on his face?\" \"You weren't there, don't start.\" \"Come on. You got a ticket?\" \"No.\" She explained, \"The man\" \u2014 I have to tell you as she did, because it loses something if I don't, you know \u2014 \"he come to the window, and he does a thing like this, which tells me he's pretty old, you know. So I look up and I'm thinking, maybe he's still going to think I'm kind of cute.\" \"Ma, are you still doing that?\" \"If it works, it works, baby. So, I say, 'Perdon, yo no hablo ingles.' Well, wouldn't you know, he had been in Honduras for the Peace Corps.\" (Laughter) So he's talking to her, and at some point she says, \"Then, you know, it was it. That was it. It was done.\" \"Yeah? What? He gave you a ticket? He didn't give you a ticket? What?\" \"No, I look up, and the light, she change.\" (Laughter) You should be terrified. Now, I don't know if she's toying with me, kind of like a cat batting back a mouse, batting back a mouse \u2014 left paw, right paw, left paw, right paw \u2014 but by now, we've reached the mall. Now, you have all been at a mall during the holidays, yes? Talk to me. Yes. Yes. You can say yes. Audience: Yes. Carmen Agra Deedy: All right, then you know that you have now entered parking lot purgatory, praying to that saint of perpetual availability that as you join that serpentine line of cars crawling along, some guy's going to turn on the brake lights just as you pull up behind him. But that doesn't happen most of the time, right? So, first I say, \"Ma, why are we here?\" \"You mean, like, in the car?\" \"No, don't \u2014 why are we here today? It's Saturday. It's the holidays.\" \"Because I have to exchange your father's underwear.\" Now, see, this is the kind of Machiavellian thinking, that you really have to \u2014 you know, in my mind, it's a rabbit's warren, this woman's mind. Do I want to walk in, because unless I have Ariadne's thread to anchor \u2014 enough metaphors for you? \u2014 somewhere, I may not get out. But you know. (Laughter) \"Why do we have to take pop's underwear back now? And why? What is wrong with his underwear?\" \"It will upset you.\" \"It won't upset me. Why? What? Is something wrong with him?\" \"No, no, no. The only thing with him is, he's an idiot. I sent him to the store, which was my first mistake, and he went to buy underwear, and he bought the grippers, and he's supposed to buy the boxers.\" \"Why?\" \"I read it on the Intersnet. You cannot have children.\" \"Oh, my God!\" (Laughter) Olivia? Huh? Huh? By now, we have now crawled another four feet, and my mother finally says to me, \"I knew it, I knew it. I'm an immigrant. We make a space. What I tell you? Right there.\" And she points out the passenger window, and I look out, and three \u2014 three \u2014 aisles down, \"Look, the Chevy.\" You want to laugh, but you don't know \u2014 you're that politically corrected, have you noticed? Correct the other direction now, it's OK. \"Look, the Chevy \u2014 he's coming this way.\" \"Mama, mama, mama, wait, wait, wait. The Chevy is three aisles away.\" She looks at me like I'm her, you know, her moron child, the cretin, the one she's got to speak to very slowly and distinctly. \"I know that, honey. Get out of the car and go stand in the parking space till I get there.\" OK, I want a vote. Come on, come on. No, no. How many of you once in your \u2014 you were a kid, you were an adult \u2014 you stood in a parking space to hold it for someone? See, we're a secret club with a secret handshake. (Laughter) And years of therapy later, we're doing great. We're doing great. We're doing fine. Well, I stood up to her. This is \u2014 you know, you'd think by now I'm \u2014 and still holding? I said, \"No way, ma, you have embarrassed me my entire life.\" Of course, her comeback is, \"When have I embarrassed you?\" (Spanish) And she's still talking while she puts the car in park, hits the emergency brake, opens the door, and with a spryness astounding in a woman her age, she jumps out of the car, knocks out the phone books, and then she walks around \u2014 she's carrying her cheap Kmart purse with her \u2014 around the front of the car. She has amazing land speed for a woman her age, too. Before I know it, she has skiddled across the parking lot and in between the cars, and people behind me, with that kind of usual religious charity that the holidays bring us, wah-wah wah-wah. \"I'm coming.\" Italian hand signals follow. I scoot over. I close the door. I leave the phone books. This is new and fast, just so you \u2014 are you still with us? We'll wait for the slow ones. OK. I start, and this is where a child says to me \u2014 and the story doesn't work if I tell you about her before, because this is my laconic child. A brevity, brevity of everything with this child. You know, she eats small portions. Language is something to be meted out in small phonemes, you know \u2014 just little hmm, hmm-hmm. She carries a mean spiral notebook and a pen. She wields great power. She listens, because that's what people who tell stories do first. But she pauses occasionally and says, \"How do you spell that? What year? OK.\" When she writes the expose in about 20 years, don't believe a word of it. But this is my daughter, Lauren, my remarkable daughter, my borderline Asperger's kid. Bless you, Dr. Watson. She says, \"Ma, you got to look!\" Now, when this kid says I got to look, you know. But it isn't like I haven't seen this crime scene before. I grew up with this woman. I said, \"Lauren, you know what, give me a play-by-play. I can't.\" \"No, mama, you got to look.\" I got to look. You got to look. Don't you want to look? There she is. I look in bewildered awe: she's standing, those Rockports slightly apart, but grounded. She's holding out that cheap Kmart purse, and she is wielding it. She's holding back tons of steel with the sheer force of her little personality, in that crone-ish voice, saying things like, \"Back it up, buddy! No, it's reserved!\" (Laughter) Ready? Brace yourselves. Here it comes. \"No, my daughter, she's coming in the Buick. Honey, sit up so they can see you.\" Oh, Jesus. Oh, Jesus. I finally come \u2014 and now, it's the South. I don't know what part of the country you live in. I think we all secretly love stories. We all secretly want our blankie and our Boo Bear. We want to curl up and say, \"Tell it to me, tell it to me. Come on, honey, tell it to me.\" But in the South, we love a good story. People have pulled aside, I mean, they've come out of that queue line, they have popped their trunks, pulled out lawn chairs and cool drinks. Bets are placed. \"I'm with the little lady. Damn!\" (Laughter) And she's bringing me in with a slight salsa movement. She is, after all, Cuban. I'm thinking, \"Accelerator, break. Accelerator, break.\" Like you've never thought that in your life? Right? Yeah. I pull in. I put the car in park. Engine's still running \u2014 mine, not the car. I jump out next to her going, \"Don't you move!\" \"I'm not going anywhere.\" She's got front seat in a Greek tragedy. I come out, and there's Esther. She's hugging the purse. \"Que?\" Which means \"what,\" and so much more. (Laughter) \"Ma, have you no shame? People are watching us all around,\" right? Now, some of them you've got to make up, people. Secret of the trade. Guess what? Some of these stories I sculpt a little, here and there. Some, they're just right there, right there. Put them right there. She says this to me. After I say \u2014 let me refresh you \u2014 \"have you no shame?\" \"No. I gave it up with pantyhose \u2014 they're both too binding.\" (Laughter) (Applause) Yeah, you can clap, but then you're about 30 seconds from the end. I'm about to snap like a brittle twig, when suddenly someone taps me on the shoulder. Intrepid soul. I'm thinking, \"This is my kid. How dare she? She jumped out of that car.\" That's OK, because my mother yells at me, I yell at her. It's a beautiful hierarchy, and it works. (Laughter) I turn around, but it's not a child. It's a young woman, a little taller than I, pale green, amused eyes. With her is a young man \u2014 husband, brother, lover, it's not my job. And she says, \"Pardon me, ma'am\" \u2014 that's how we talk down there \u2014 \"is that your mother?\" I said, \"No, I follow little old women around parking lots to see if they'll stop. Yes, it's my mother!\" The boy, now, he says. \"Well, what my sister meant\" \u2014 they look at each other, it's a knowing glance \u2014 \"God, she's crazy!\" I said, (Spanish), and the young girl and the young boy say, \"No, no, honey, we just want to know one more thing.\" I said, \"Look, please, let me take care of her, OK, because I know her, and believe me, she's like a small atomic weapon, you know, you just want to handle her really gingerly.\" And the girl goes, \"I know, but, I mean, I swear to God, she reminds us of our mother.\" I almost miss it. He turns to her on the heel of his shoe. It's a half-whisper, \"God, I miss her.\" They turn then, shoulder to shoulder, and walk away, lost in their own reverie. Memories of some maddening woman who was the luck of their DNA draw. And I turn to Esther, who's rocking on those 'ports, and says, \"You know what, honey?\" \"What, ma?\" \"I'm going to drive you crazy probably for about 14, 15 more years, if you're lucky, but after that, honey, you're going to miss me.\" (Applause)", "id": 347, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:11.958 --> 00:00:16.958\nWhen I knew I was going to come to speak to you, I thought,\n\n00:00:17.958 --> 00:00:19.958\n\"I gotta call my mother.\"\n\n00:00:19.958 --> 00:00:22.958\nI have a little Cuban mother -- she's about that big.\n\n00:00:22.958 --> 00:00:25.958\nFour feet. Nothing larger than the sum of her figurative parts.\n\n00:00:25.958 --> 00:00:27.958\nYou still with me? (Laughter)\n\n00:00:27.958 --> 00:00:28.958\nI called her up.\n\n00:00:28.958 --> 00:00:30.958\n\"Hello, how're you doing, baby?\"\n\n00:00:30.958 --> 00:00:32.958\n\"Hey, ma, I got to talk to you.\"\n\n00:00:32.958 --> 00:00:34.958\n\"You're talking to me already. What's the matter?\"\n\n00:00:34.958 --> 00:00:36.958\nI said, \"I've got to talk to a bunch of nice people.\"\n\n00:00:36.958 --> 00:00:38.958\n\"You're always talking to nice people, except when you went\n\n00:00:38.958 --> 00:00:39.958\nto the White House.\"\n\n00:00:39.958 --> 00:00:41.958\n\"Ma, don't start!\"\n\n00:00:43.958 --> 00:00:46.958\nAnd I told her I was coming to TED, and she said,\n\n00:00:46.958 --> 00:00:47.958\n\"What's the problem?\"\n\n00:00:47.958 --> 00:00:49.958\nAnd I said, \"Well, I'm not sure.\"\n\n00:00:49.958 --> 00:00:54.958\nI said, \"I have to talk to them about stories.\n\n00:00:55.958 --> 00:00:58.958\nIt's 'Technology, Entertainment and Design.'\"\n\n00:00:59.958 --> 00:01:05.958\nAnd she said, \"Well, you design a story when you make it up,\n\n00:01:05.958 --> 00:01:07.958\nit's entertainment when you tell it,\n\n00:01:07.958 --> 00:01:09.958\nand you're going to use a microphone.\"\n\n00:01:09.958 --> 00:01:12.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:01:12.958 --> 00:01:14.958\nI said, \"You're a peach, ma. Pop there?\"\n\n00:01:14.958 --> 00:01:16.958\n\"What's the matter? The pearls of wisdom\n\n00:01:16.958 --> 00:01:19.958\nleaping from my lips like lemmings is no good for you?\"\n\n00:01:19.958 --> 00:01:21.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:01:21.958 --> 00:01:22.958\nThen my pop got on there.\n\n00:01:22.958 --> 00:01:25.958\nMy pop, he's one of the old souls, you know --\n\n00:01:25.958 --> 00:01:28.958\nold Cuban man from Camaguey.\n\n00:01:28.958 --> 00:01:30.958\nCamaguey is a province in Cuba.\n\n00:01:30.958 --> 00:01:32.958\nHe's from Florida.\n\n00:01:32.958 --> 00:01:34.958\nHe was born there in 1924.\n\n00:01:34.958 --> 00:01:38.958\nHe grew up in a bohio of dirt floors,\n\n00:01:38.958 --> 00:01:41.958\nand the structure was the kind used by the Tainos,\n\n00:01:41.958 --> 00:01:43.958\nour old Arawak ancestors.\n\n00:01:44.958 --> 00:01:50.958\nMy father is at once quick-witted, wickedly funny,\n\n00:01:51.958 --> 00:01:59.958\nand then poignancy turns on a dime and leaves you breathless.\n\n00:01:59.958 --> 00:02:02.958\n\"Papi, help.\"\n\n00:02:02.958 --> 00:02:05.958\n\"I already heard your mother. I think she's right.\"\n\n00:02:05.958 --> 00:02:07.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:02:07.958 --> 00:02:09.958\n\"After what I just told you?\"\n\n00:02:09.958 --> 00:02:11.958\nMy whole life, my father's been there.\n\n00:02:11.958 --> 00:02:13.958\nSo we talked for a few minutes, and he said,\n\n00:02:13.958 --> 00:02:15.958\n\"Why don't you tell them what you believe?\"\n\n00:02:15.958 --> 00:02:18.958\nI love that, but we don't have the time.\n\n00:02:18.958 --> 00:02:24.958\nGood storytelling is crafting a story that someone wants to listen to.\n\n00:02:24.958 --> 00:02:28.958\nGreat story is the art of letting go.\n\n00:02:29.958 --> 00:02:31.958\nSo I'm going to tell you a little story.\n\n00:02:31.958 --> 00:02:33.958\nRemember, this tradition comes to us\n\n00:02:33.958 --> 00:02:37.958\nnot from the mists of Avalon, back in time, but further still,\n\n00:02:37.958 --> 00:02:40.958\nbefore we were scratching out these stories on papyrus,\n\n00:02:40.958 --> 00:02:46.958\nor we were doing the pictographs on walls in moist, damp caves.\n\n00:02:46.958 --> 00:02:49.958\nBack then, we had an urge, a need, to tell the story.\n\n00:02:49.958 --> 00:02:53.958\nWhen Lexus wants to sell you a car, they're telling you a story.\n\n00:02:54.958 --> 00:02:56.958\nHave you been watching the commercials?\n\n00:02:56.958 --> 00:03:01.958\nBecause every one of us has this desire, for once -- just once --\n\n00:03:01.958 --> 00:03:03.958\nto tell our story and have it heard.\n\n00:03:04.958 --> 00:03:08.958\nThere are stories you tell from stages.\n\n00:03:08.958 --> 00:03:12.958\nThere's stories that you may tell\n\n00:03:12.958 --> 00:03:14.958\nin a small group of people with some good wine.\n\n00:03:15.958 --> 00:03:19.958\nAnd there's stories you tell late at night to a friend,\n\n00:03:20.958 --> 00:03:23.958\nmaybe once in your life.\n\n00:03:24.958 --> 00:03:32.958\nAnd then there are stories that we whisper into a Stygian darkness.\n\n00:03:32.958 --> 00:03:34.958\nI'm not telling you that story.\n\n00:03:34.958 --> 00:03:36.958\nI'm telling you this one.\n\n00:03:36.958 --> 00:03:38.958\nIt's called, \"You're Going to Miss Me.\"\n\n00:03:38.958 --> 00:03:41.958\nIt's about human connection.\n\n00:03:41.958 --> 00:03:43.958\nMy Cuban mother, which I just briefly introduced you to\n\n00:03:43.958 --> 00:03:46.958\nin that short character sketch,\n\n00:03:47.958 --> 00:03:51.958\ncame to the United States one thousand years ago.\n\n00:03:51.958 --> 00:03:55.958\nI was born in 19 -- I forget, and I came to this country\n\n00:03:55.958 --> 00:03:57.958\nwith them in the aftermath of the Cuban revolution.\n\n00:03:57.958 --> 00:04:00.958\nWe went from Havana, Cuba to Decatur, Georgia.\n\n00:04:01.958 --> 00:04:03.958\nAnd Decatur, Georgia's a small Southern town.\n\n00:04:03.958 --> 00:04:06.958\nAnd in that little Southern town, I grew up,\n\n00:04:06.958 --> 00:04:08.958\nand grew up hearing these stories.\n\n00:04:08.958 --> 00:04:10.958\nBut this story only happened a few years ago.\n\n00:04:10.958 --> 00:04:12.958\nI called my mom.\n\n00:04:12.958 --> 00:04:14.958\nIt was a Saturday morning.\n\n00:04:14.958 --> 00:04:16.958\nAnd I was calling about how to make ajiaco. It's a Cuban meal.\n\n00:04:16.958 --> 00:04:18.958\nIt's delicious.

It turns out that in about the 1880s, the missionaries came to Africa to spread the word of Christianity, to teach English to the natives. And they brought blackboards and chalk. And I'd like you to imagine that that's a blackboard, and I just used some chalk on there. And they brought quite a bit of this stuff. But over the years, the blackboards were fine, but they ran out of chalk. And this is a real crisis for them.And that's where the hyena comes in. The hyena is probably the most perfectly designed scavenging animal in the world. It strip-mines carcasses, and it has amazing teeth, because it enables the hyena to essentially eat bones. Now, the end product of that action is up on the board here. What the missionaries would do is, they'd walk around and they'd pick up hyena shit. And the incredible thing about hyena shit is, it makes great chalk.(Laughter)That's not what I'm here to talk about, but it is a fascinating aspect of animal design. What I'm here to talk about is the camel. When I started talking to Richard about what I was going to speak about, I had recently come back from Jordan, where I had an amazing experience with a camel.(Laughter)And we were in the desert.Richard Wurman: That's the end! Keith Bellows: Yeah, yeah.We were in the desert, in Wadi Rum, in a small Jeep. There were four of us, two Bedouin drivers. You can just imagine, this expanse is an ocean of sand, 105 degrees, one water bottle. And we were driving in what they told us was their very, very best Jeep. Didn't look like it to me. And as we started to go through the desert, the Jeep broke down. The guys got out, they put the hood up, they started working under the hood, got it going again. About a hundred yards, it broke down. This went on about 6-7 times, we were getting more and more alarmed, we were also getting deeper and deeper into the desert.And eventually, our worst nightmare happened: they flooded the engine. And they said, \"Ah, no problem! We just get out and walk.\" And we said, \"We get out and walk?\" One water bottle, remember, guys, four people. And they said, \"Yeah, yeah, we'll walk. We'll find some camels.\" We got out and walked, and sure enough, about half a mile, we came over the crest of this hill, and there was a huge gathering of Bedouin with their camels. The guy went up and started dickering, and 10 dollars later, we had four camels. They went down like elevators; we got on them. They went back up, and the Bedouin, each Bedouin, four of them, got behind each of the camels with a little whip. And they started slashing away at the back of the camels, and they started galloping. And if you've ever been on a camel, it is a very, very uncomfortable ride. There's also one other aspect about these camels. About every 10 steps, they lean back and try to take a chunk out of your leg.(Laughter)So we kept on going, and this camel kept on trying to take a chunk out of my leg. And eventually, three miles later, we arrived at our destination, where a Jeep was supposed to meet us. And the camels come down again like elevators, we sort of clumsily get off, and they, obviously, try to take another chunk out of my leg. And I've developed a very wonderful relationship with this creature by this point, and I've realized that this is a mean son of a bitch. And much meaner, by the way, than the Bedouin who greeted me and tried to sell me one of his 26 daughters to take back to the States.So as we talked, Richard and I, I said, \"You know, maybe I should bring a camel. It's the best designed animal in the world.\" He went, \"Nah. I don't think we want to be bringing a camel.\" And you should be really glad we decided not to bring the camel. So I did the next best thing. I went to the Washington Zoo. Richard said, \"I want you to get up close and personal with this camel. I want you to inspect its mouth, look at its teeth. Go underneath it. Go above it. Go around it. Pull its tail up; take a look in there. I want you to get as close to that camel as you possibly can.\"So, I got a National Geographic film crew. We went down there, and I took one look at this camel. It is a 2,000 pound creature who is in rut.(Laughter)Now, if you've ever seen a 2,000 pound camel in rut, it is a scary, scary thing to behold. And if Richard thought I was getting in the ring with that camel, someone was smoking Bedouin high grade.(Laughter)So we got as close to it as possible, and I'm going to share this. Chris, if you want to roll this film. Then I'm going to show you a little bit more about the design of camels.Do you want to roll the film?(Adventure music)(Video) Hello. This is Keith Bellows with the TED National Geographic Camel Investigation Unit. I'm here to look at the ultimate desert machine.(Music continues)Keith Bellows: And you'll note I started chewing gum because I was around this camel all day.(Video) That's it, OK. No! See, now he's getting a little overexcited. So we'll need to be very careful around him. Don't let him get you. Now, you can see copious amounts of saliva in there. I always called myself the unstable stable boy. Their nose, you can see his nose is flared right now. When they're in rut, they're similar to seals in the way, like, a seal has to open its nose to breathe. And they're similar. They have to consciously open their nose.KB: Ears?SK: They are small. But they have excellent hearing. But not big; for instance, in zebras, they have a huge ear that's very mobile, so they can actually turn them both around. And they use them in the same way we use our binocular vision. They use that to pinpoint sound. The desert's extremely windy as well as being very cold. So not only do they have the very long eyelashes, but there's the secondary \u2014 I guess you'd call it the [unclear] or whatever. It's this hair that's above the eyes, and below it, it's longer.Most people think that the humps store water. They don't. They store fat. Now, I'm not a chemist, but basically what happens is the fat is oxidized by their breathing. And that will turn it into actually usable water. Like a lot of predators, they walk on their toes. But there's a big fat pad in there that squishes out. They're like sun shoes, but, you know, with sand. Hooves? They don't have traditional hooves, but they do have one, like, big nail.(Audience laughter)You can't really see too clear. The fur's kind of grown over. But they use their tails a lot, especially in rut. He will urinate and spin his tail to spread the urine around and make him more attractive. I don't know why that would be, but it works for them. So, what the hell.(Audience laughter)Now, they will also defecate in certain areas. Generally, they poop wherever they want to, but during their rut, they will defecate in perimeter areas. I don't know if you've read or heard about the sub-sonic sounds from elephants, you know what I mean, like, \"Br-r-r!\" These big, big rumbling sounds. He will do the same thing. You can actually see, right here, it will vibrate. We weigh our animals. Unfortunately, he's a very aggressive animal, so he's actually destroyed some of the scales. We had these big things that I weigh the bison on, for instance. I'm guessing that he's at least 1,600 pounds. But I would put him closer to 2,000. He's basically a walking mulch pile. We're kind of like buds, but I'm also a male as well.KB: He sees you as competition? Senior Keeper: Yeah, exactly. And it makes him very dangerous at this time of year. Don't even think about it. Don't think about it!But now, we're going to meet. Out! Out! Out! No. Out!(Music)(Applause)KB: What I didn't show you was, you got that swinging thing going? Well, and you're glad I didn't show you this. One of the other things about the camel's beautiful design is that its penis points backwards. That way the camel can dip its tail in the stream, and just whacker the entire area around him. And that's how he really marks his territory. Now, what you also didn't see was that \u2014 and you may have noticed in the pen beside him and, by the way, the camel's name is Suki. In the pen beside him is Jasmine. Jasmine has been his mate for some time. But on this particular occasion, it was very, very clear that as horny as Suki was, Jasmine was having none of it. And so we started thinking. Well, if poor old Suki is in search of a mate, what would Suki do to find the perfect mate?I'm going to show you another film. But before I do, I just want to mention that this animal truly is a sort of the SUV of the sand, the ship of the desert. It's so vital to the inhabitants of the areas in which the camel is found, largely Mongolia and Sahara, that there are 160 words in Arabic to describe the camel. And if this is a creature that was designed by committee, it's certainly been like no committee I've ever been on. So here's what Suki would do in search of a mate. Can you roll it, please?Camel seeking camel Lusty beast desires attractive and sincere mate. I'm seven feet, 2,000 lbs., with brown hair and eyes, long legs \u2014 and I'm very well ... hung. I'm TED Camel. The perfect desert machine. I'm smartly designed. Eyelashes that keep out sand and a third eyelash that works like a windshield wiper. A distinguished nose \u2014 with nostrils lined to filter out sand and dust and a groove that catches moisture. Amazingly full lips \u2014 that allow me to eat practically anything that grows. Callouses on my knees that let me kneel comfortably. Leathery chest pads that beat the heat. Short fur that keeps my skin cool. Long legs that allow heat to escape. And my hump? Ogden Nash once wrote: \"The camel has a single hump; the dromedary two, or else the other way around. I'm never sure. Are you?\" Here's a hint: Bactarian. Dromedary. My hump contains up to 80 lbs. of fat, but doesn't store H2O. I'm built to last. I'm the go-to animal when the oasis is dry. I usually won't sweat until my body reaches 105 \u00baF, enough to fry an egg. I'm able to lose 40% of my weight without dying. (Most animals would if they lost half that much.) I'll drink 5 to 7 gallons of water a day. But go without for more than a month. I'm powerful. Able to pack up to 400 lbs. of cargo. Outrun a horse \u2014 And cover 26 miles on a good day. Camelot. Jackie O. once said that traveling by camel made riding an elephant seem like taking a jet plane. Yet my large, soft feet allow me to navigate sand. (Is that why the Bedouin claim I can dance?) I'm a good provider, too. Bedouins call the camel the Gift of God. No surprise. Tents and rugs are made of my hair. My dried bones are prized as a sort of ivory. My dung is burned as fuel. My milk is used for cheese. \"Camels are like angels,\" a Bedouin once said.(Applause)Thank you. I just want to leave you with one last thought, which is probably the most important thing to take away. Humans, the animal, are pretty lucky creatures because, by and large, we really don't have to adapt to our environment; we adapt our environment to us. And we've seen that repeatedly through this conference, not just this year, but in past years. But this creature that you've just seen ultimately adapts, and keeps adapting and adapting. I think when you look at the animal kingdom, that is one of the most remarkable things. It doesn't have an environment that adapts to it; it has to adapt to the environment.Ricky, thank you very much for having me.RW: That's terrific. Thank you.", "id": 345, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:16.958 --> 00:00:18.934\n[SHIT]\n\n00:00:18.958 --> 00:00:21.934\nThis is arguably the back end\nof the design of animals.\n\n00:00:21.958 --> 00:00:24.934\n(Laughter)\n\n00:00:24.958 --> 00:00:28.378\nBut the reason\nI put this up here is because\n\n00:00:28.402 --> 00:00:32.513\nwhen I was in Africa last year,\nmy wife and I were driving around,\n\n00:00:32.537 --> 00:00:34.759\nwe had this wonderful guide,\n\n00:00:34.783 --> 00:00:37.934\nwho showed us something\nthat surprised both of us,\n\n00:00:37.958 --> 00:00:40.934\nand it was very revealing\nin terms of the fascination\n\n00:00:40.958 --> 00:00:42.934\nthat comes with the design of animals.\n\n00:00:42.958 --> 00:00:46.934\nIt turns out that in about the 1880s,\nthe missionaries came to Africa\n\n00:00:46.958 --> 00:00:48.934\nto spread the word of Christianity,\n\n00:00:48.958 --> 00:00:50.935\nto teach English to the natives.\n\n00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:53.852\nAnd they brought blackboards and chalk.\n\n00:00:53.876 --> 00:00:56.429\nAnd I'd like you to imagine\nthat that's a blackboard,\n\n00:00:56.453 --> 00:00:58.275\nand I just used some chalk on there.\n\n00:00:58.299 --> 00:01:00.700\nAnd they brought\nquite a bit of this stuff.\n\n00:01:00.803 --> 00:01:03.361\nBut over the years,\nthe blackboards were fine,\n\n00:01:03.385 --> 00:01:05.362\nbut they ran out of chalk.\n\n00:01:05.386 --> 00:01:07.386\nAnd this is a real crisis for them.\n\n00:01:07.549 --> 00:01:10.259\nAnd that's where the hyena comes in.\n\n00:01:10.676 --> 00:01:13.034\nThe hyena is probably\nthe most perfectly designed\n\n00:01:13.058 --> 00:01:14.935\nscavenging animal in the world.\n\n00:01:14.959 --> 00:01:18.934\nIt strip-mines carcasses,\nand it has amazing teeth,\n\n00:01:18.958 --> 00:01:23.751\nbecause it enables the hyena\nto essentially eat bones.\n\n00:01:23.958 --> 00:01:28.958\nNow, the end product of that action\nis up on the board here.\n\n00:01:29.709 --> 00:01:34.623\nWhat the missionaries would do is,\nthey'd walk around\n\n00:01:34.995 --> 00:01:36.711\nand they'd pick up hyena shit.\n\n00:01:36.958 --> 00:01:40.434\nAnd the incredible thing\nabout hyena shit is, it makes great chalk.\n\n00:01:40.917 --> 00:01:42.013\n(Laughter)\n\n00:01:42.037 --> 00:01:43.934\nThat's not what I'm here to talk about,\n\n00:01:43.958 --> 00:01:48.569\nbut it is a fascinating aspect\nof animal design.\n\n00:01:48.593 --> 00:01:50.934\nWhat I'm here to talk about is the camel.\n\n00:01:50.958 --> 00:01:52.934\nWhen I started talking to Richard\n\n00:01:52.958 --> 00:01:54.934\nabout what I was going to speak about,\n\n00:01:54.958 --> 00:01:57.582\nI had recently come back from Jordan,\n\n00:01:57.606 --> 00:02:00.828\nwhere I had an amazing\nexperience with a camel.\n\n00:02:00.958 --> 00:02:03.934\n(Laughter)\n\n00:02:03.958 --> 00:02:05.379\nAnd we were in the desert.\n\n00:02:05.403 --> 00:02:08.220\nRichard Wurman: That's the end!\nKeith Bellows: Yeah, yeah.\n\n00:02:08.244 --> 00:02:11.489\nWe were in the desert,\nin Wadi Rum, in a small Jeep.\n\n00:02:11.513 --> 00:02:13.513\nThere were four of us,\ntwo Bedouin drivers.\n\n00:02:13.958 --> 00:02:17.845\nYou can just imagine,\nthis expanse is an ocean of sand,\n\n00:02:17.958 --> 00:02:19.958\n105 degrees, one water bottle.\n\n00:02:20.656 --> 00:02:25.918\nAnd we were driving in what they told us\nwas their very, very best Jeep.\n\n00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:28.560\nDidn't look like it to me.\n\n00:02:28.584 --> 00:02:31.486\nAnd as we started to go\nthrough the desert,\n\n00:02:32.653 --> 00:02:33.934\nthe Jeep broke down.\n\n00:02:33.958 --> 00:02:35.934\nThe guys got out, they put the hood up,\n\n00:02:35.958 --> 00:02:38.633\nthey started working\nunder the hood, got it going again.\n\n00:02:38.657 --> 00:02:40.427\nAbout a hundred yards, it broke down.\n\n00:02:40.451 --> 00:02:43.728\nThis went on about 6-7 times,\nwe were getting more and more alarmed,\n\n00:02:43.752 --> 00:02:46.410\nwe were also getting deeper\nand deeper into the desert.\n\n00:02:46.434 --> 00:02:48.934\nAnd eventually,\nour worst nightmare happened:\n\n00:02:48.958 --> 00:02:50.934\nthey flooded the engine.\n\n00:02:50.958 --> 00:02:54.682\nAnd they said, \"Ah, no problem!\nWe just get out and walk.\"\n\n00:02:55.153 --> 00:02:56.935\nAnd we said, \"We get out and walk?\"\n\n00:02:56.959 --> 00:02:59.211\nOne water bottle, remember,\nguys, four people.\n\n00:02:59.235 --> 00:03:02.592\nAnd they said, \"Yeah, yeah, we'll walk.\nWe'll find some camels.\"\n\n00:03:02.902 --> 00:03:04.855\nWe got out and walked, and sure enough,\n\n00:03:04.879 --> 00:03:07.489\nabout half a mile, we came\nover the crest of this hill,\n\n00:03:07.513 --> 00:03:10.411\nand there was a huge gathering\nof Bedouin with their camels.\n\n00:03:10.435 --> 00:03:12.330\nThe guy went up and started dickering,\n\n00:03:12.354 --> 00:03:14.934\nand 10 dollars later, we had four camels.\n\n00:03:14.958 --> 00:03:17.476\nThey went down like elevators;\nwe got on them.\n\n00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:20.934\nThey went back up, and the Bedouin,\neach Bedouin, four of them,\n\n00:03:20.958 --> 00:03:23.934\ngot behind each of the camels\nwith a little whip.\n\n00:03:23.958 --> 00:03:26.934\nAnd they started slashing away\nat the back of the camels,\n\n00:03:26.958 --> 00:03:28.250\nand they started galloping.\n\n00:03:28.274 --> 00:03:31.751\nAnd if you've ever been on a camel,\nit is a very, very uncomfortable ride.\n\n00:03:31.958 --> 00:03:34.934\nThere's also one other aspect\nabout these camels.\n\n00:03:34.958 --> 00:03:36.934\nAbout every 10 steps, they lean back\n\n00:03:36.958 --> 00:03:38.934\nand try to take a chunk out of your leg.\n\n00:03:38.958 --> 00:03:40.037\n(Laughter)\n\n00:03:40.061 --> 00:03:41.934\nSo we kept on going,\n\n00:03:41.958 --> 00:03:44.934\nand this camel kept on trying\nto take a chunk out of my leg.\n\n00:03:44.958 --> 00:03:48.092\nAnd eventually, three miles later,\nwe arrived at our destination,\n\n00:03:48.116 --> 00:03:49.934\nwhere a Jeep was supposed to meet us.\n\n00:03:49.958 --> 00:03:52.275\nAnd the camels come down\nagain like elevators,\n\n00:03:52.434 --> 00:03:53.934\nwe sort of clumsily get off,\n\n00:03:53.958 --> 00:03:56.934\nand they, obviously, try to take\nanother chunk out of my leg.\n\n00:03:56.958 --> 00:03:59.934\nAnd I've developed\na very wonderful relationship\n\n00:03:59.958 --> 00:04:01.934\nwith this creature by this point,\n\n00:04:01.958 --> 00:04:04.958\nand I've realized\nthat this is a mean son of a bitch.\n\n00:04:05.958 --> 00:04:08.934\nAnd much meaner, by the way,\nthan the Bedouin who greeted me\n\n00:04:08.958 --> 00:04:11.498\nand tried to sell me\none of his 26 daughters\n\n00:04:11.522 --> 00:04:13.498\nto take back to the States.\n\n00:04:13.958 --> 00:04:15.832\nSo as we talked, Richard and I,\n\n00:04:15.856 --> 00:04:18.117\nI said, \"You know, maybe\nI should bring a camel.\n\n00:04:18.141 --> 00:04:20.374\nIt's the best designed\nanimal in the world.\"\n\n00:04:20.398 --> 00:04:23.282\nHe went, \"Nah. I don't think\nwe want to be bringing a camel.\"\n\n00:04:23.306 --> 00:04:26.443\nAnd you should be really glad\nwe decided not to bring the camel.\n\n00:04:26.467 --> 00:04:27.958\nSo I did the next best thing.\n\n00:04:28.958 --> 00:04:30.919\nI went to the Washington Zoo.\n\n00:04:30.943 --> 00:04:35.296\nRichard said, \"I want you to get up\nclose and personal with this camel.\n\n00:04:35.527 --> 00:04:38.471\nI want you to inspect its mouth,\nlook at its teeth.\n\n00:04:38.495 --> 00:04:40.934\nGo underneath it.\nGo above it. Go around it.\n\n00:04:40.958 --> 00:04:43.491\nPull its tail up; take a look in there.\n\n00:04:43.696 --> 00:04:46.934\nI want you to get as close\nto that camel as you possibly can.\"\n\n00:04:46.958 --> 00:04:50.204\nSo, I got a National Geographic film crew.\n\n00:04:50.624 --> 00:04:55.130\nWe went down there,\nand I took one look at this camel.\n\n00:04:56.340 --> 00:05:00.934\nIt is a 2,000 pound creature\nwho is in rut.\n\n00:05:00.958 --> 00:05:03.752\n(Laughter)\n\n00:05:03.776 --> 00:05:06.633\nNow, if you've ever seen\na 2,000 pound camel in rut,\n\n00:05:06.657 --> 00:05:08.894\nit is a scary, scary thing to behold.\n\n00:05:09.815 --> 00:05:13.481\nAnd if Richard thought I was getting\nin the ring with that camel,\n\n00:05:13.505 --> 00:05:15.934\nsomeone was smoking Bedouin high grade.\n\n00:05:15.958 --> 00:05:17.140\n(Laughter)\n\n00:05:17.164 --> 00:05:20.934\nSo we got as close to it as possible,\n\n00:05:20.958 --> 00:05:22.300\nand I'm going to share this.\n\n00:05:22.324 --> 00:05:24.093\nChris, if you want to roll this film.\n\n00:05:24.117 --> 00:05:25.371\nThen I'm going to show you\n\n00:05:25.395 --> 00:05:27.491\na little bit more\nabout the design of camels.\n\n00:05:27.515 --> 00:05:28.896\nDo you want to roll the film?\n\n00:05:29.245 --> 00:05:31.300\n(Adventure music)\n\n00:06:04.163 --> 00:06:05.899\n(Video) Hello. This is Keith Bellows\n\n00:06:05.923 --> 00:06:09.417\nwith the TED National Geographic\nCamel Investigation Unit.\n\n00:06:09.441 --> 00:06:12.441\nI'm here to look\nat the ultimate desert machine.\n\n00:06:12.874 --> 00:06:15.255\n(Music continues)\n\n00:06:19.870 --> 00:06:22.363\nKeith Bellows: And you'll note\nI started chewing gum\n\n00:06:22.387 --> 00:06:24.363\nbecause I was around this camel all day.\n\n00:06:24.922 --> 00:06:26.501\n(Video) That's it, OK. No!\n\n00:06:27.585 --> 00:06:29.615\nSee, now he's getting\na little overexcited.\n\n00:06:29.639 --> 00:06:33.214\nSo we'll need to be very careful\naround him.

I'm the Director of Nutrition Services for the Berkeley Unified School District. I have 90 employees and 17 locations, 9,600 kids. I'm doing 7,100 meals a day and I've been doing it for two years, trying to change how we feed kids in America. And that's what I want to talk to you a little bit about today. These are some of my kids with a salad bar. I put salad bars in all of our schools when I got there. Everyone says it couldn't be done. Little kids couldn't eat off the salad bar, big kids would spit in it \u2014 neither happened.When I took over this, I tried to really figure out, like, what my vision would be. How do we really change children's relationship to food? And I'll tell you why we need to change it, but we absolutely have to change it. And what I came to understand is, we needed to teach children the symbiotic relationship between a healthy planet, healthy food and healthy kids. And that if we don't do that, the antithesis, although we've heard otherwise, is we're really going to become extinct, because we're feeding our children to death. That's my premise.We're seeing sick kids get sicker and sicker. And the reason this is happening, by and large, is because of our food system and the way the government commodifies food, the way the government oversees our food, the way the USDA puts food on kids' plates that's unhealthy, and allows unhealthy food into schools. And by \u2014 tacitly, all of us send our kids, or grandchildren, or nieces, or nephews, to school and tell them to learn, you know, learn what's in those schools. And when you feed these kids bad food, that's what they're learning. So that's really what this is all about.The way we got here is because of big agribusiness. We now live in a country where most of us don't decide, by and large, what we eat. We see big businesses, Monsanto and DuPont, who brought out Agent Orange and stain-resistant carpet. They control 90 percent of the commercially produced seeds in our country. These are \u2014 10 companies control much of what's in our grocery stores, much of what people eat. And that's really, really a problem.So when I started thinking about these issues and how I was going to change what kids ate, I really started focusing on what we would teach them. And the very first thing was about regional food \u2014 trying to eat food from within our region. And clearly, with what's going on with fossil fuel usage, or when \u2014 as the fossil fuel is going away, as oil hits its peak oil, you know, we really have to start thinking about whether or not we should, or could, be moving food 1,500 miles before we eat it. So we talked to kids about that, and we really start to feed kids regional food.And then we talk about organic food. Now, most school districts can't really afford organic food, but we, as a nation, have to start thinking about consuming, growing and feeding our children food that's not chock-full of chemicals. We can't keep feeding our kids pesticides and herbicides and antibiotics and hormones. We can't keep doing that. You know, it doesn't work. And the results of that are kids getting sick.One of my big soapboxes right now is antibiotics. Seventy percent of all antibiotics consumed in America is consumed in animal husbandry. We are feeding our kids antibiotics in beef and other animal protein every day. Seventy percent \u2014 it's unbelievable. And the result of it is, we have diseases. We have things like E. coli that we can't fix, that we can't make kids better when they get sick. And, you know, certainly antibiotics have been over-prescribed, but it's an issue in the food supply. One of my favorite facts is that U.S. agriculture uses 1.2 billion pounds of pesticides every year. That means every one of us, and our children, consumes what would equal a five-pound bag \u2014 those bags you have at home. If I had one here and ripped it open, and that pile I would have on the floor is what we consume and feed our children every year because of what goes into our food supply, because of the way we consume produce in America.The USDA allows these antibiotics, these hormones and these pesticides in our food supply, and the USDA paid for this ad in Time magazine. Okay, we could talk about Rachel Carson and DDT, but we know it wasn't good for you and me. And that is what the USDA allows in our food supply. And that has to change, you know. The USDA cannot be seen as the be-all and end-all of what we feed our kids and what's allowed. We cannot believe that they have our best interests at heart. The antithesis of this whole thing is sustainable food. That's what I really try and get people to understand. I really try and teach it to kids. I think it's the most important. It's consuming food in a way in which we'll still have a planet, in which kids will grow up to be healthy, and which really tries to mitigate all the negative impacts we're seeing. It really is just a new idea. I mean, people toss around sustainability, but we have to figure out what sustainability is.In less than 200 years, you know, just in a few generations, we've gone from being 200 \u2014 being 100 percent, 95 percent farmers to less than 2 percent of farmers. We now live in a country that has more prisoners than farmers \u2014 2.1 million prisoners, 1.9 million farmers. And we spend 35,000 dollars on average a year keeping a prisoner in prison, and school districts spend 500 dollars a year feeding a child. It's no wonder, you know, we have criminals.(Laughter)And what's happening is, we're getting sick. We're getting sick and our kids are getting sick. It is about what we feed them. What goes in is what we are. We really are what we eat. And if we continue down this path, if we continue to feed kids bad food, if we continue not to teach them what good food is, what's going to happen? You know, what is going to happen? What's going to happen to our whole medical system? What's going to happen is, we're going to have kids that have a life less long than our own. The CDC, the Center for Disease Control, has said, of the children born in the year 2000 \u2014 those seven- and eight-year-olds today \u2014 one out of every three Caucasians, one out of every two African-Americans and Hispanics are going to have diabetes in their lifetime. And if that's not enough, they've gone on to say, most before they graduate high school. This means that 40 or 45 percent of all school-aged children could be insulin-dependent within a decade. Within a decade.What's going to happen? Well, the CDC has gone further to say that those children born in the year 2000 could be the first generation in our country's history to die at a younger age than their parents. And it's because of what we feed them. Because eight-year-olds don't get to decide \u2014 and if they do, you should be in therapy. You know, we are responsible for what kids eat. But oops, maybe they're responsible for what kids eat. Big companies spend 20 billion dollars a year marketing non-nutrient foods to kids. 20 billion dollars a year. 10,000 ads most kids see. They spend 500 dollars for every one dollar \u2014 500 dollars marketing foods that kids shouldn't eat for every one dollar marketing healthy, nutritious food. The result of which is kids think they're going to die if they don't have chicken nuggets.You know that everybody thinks they should be eating more, and more, and more. This is the USDA portion size, that little, tiny thing. And the one over there, that's bigger than my head, is what McDonald's and Burger King and those big companies think we should eat. And why can they serve that much? Why can we have 29-cent Big Gulps and 99-cent double burgers? It's because of the way the government commodifies food, and the cheap corn and cheap soy that are pushed into our food supply that makes these non-nutrient foods really, really cheap. Which is why I say it's a social justice issue.Now, I said I'm doing this in Berkeley, and you might think, \"Oh, Berkeley. Of course you can do it in Berkeley.\" Well, this is the food I found 24 months ago. This is not even food. This is the stuff we were feeding our kids: Extremo Burritos, corn dogs, pizza pockets, grilled cheese sandwiches. Everything came in plastic, in cardboard. The only kitchen tools my staff had was a box cutter. The only working piece of equipment in my kitchen was a can crusher, because if it didn't come in a can, it came frozen in a box. The USDA allows this. The USDA allows all of this stuff. In case you can't tell, that's, like, pink Danish and some kind of cupcakes. Chicken nuggets, Tater Tots, chocolate milk with high fructose, canned fruit cocktail \u2014 a reimbursable meal.That's what the government says is okay to feed our kids. It ain't okay. You know what? It is not okay. And we, all of us, have to understand that this is about us, that we can make a difference here. Now I don't know if any of you out there invented chicken nuggets, but I'm sure you're rich if you did. But whoever decided that a chicken should look like a heart, a giraffe, a star? Well, Tyson did, because there's no chicken in the chicken. And that they could figure it out, that we could sell this stuff to kids. You know, what's wrong with teaching kids that chicken looks like chicken? But this is what most schools serve. In fact, this may be what a lot of parents serve, as opposed to \u2014 this is what we try and serve.We really need to change this whole paradigm with kids and food. We really have to teach children that chicken is not a giraffe. You know, that vegetables are actually colorful, that they have flavor, that carrots grow in the ground, that strawberries grow in the ground. There's not a strawberry tree or a carrot bush. You know, we have to change the way we teach kids about these things. There's a lot of stuff we can do. There's a lot of schools doing farm-to-school programs. There's a lot of schools actually getting fresh food into schools.Now, in Berkeley, we've gone totally fresh. We have no high-fructose corn syrup, no trans fats, no processed foods. We're cooking from scratch every day. We have 25 percent of our \u2014 (Applause) thank you \u2014 25 percent of our stuff is organic and local. We cook. Those are my hands. I get up at 4 a.m. every day and go cook the food for the kids, because this is what we need to do. We can't keep serving kids processed crap, full of chemicals, and expect these are going to be healthy citizens. You're not going to get the next generation, or the generation after, to be able to think like this if they're not nourished. If they're eating chemicals all the time, they're not going to be able to think. They're not going to be smart. You know what? They're just going to be sick.Now one of the things that \u2014 what happened when I went into Berkeley is I realized that, you know, this was all pretty amazing to people, very, very different, and I needed to market it. I came up with these calendars that I sent home to every parent. And these calendars really started to lay out my program. Now I'm in charge of all the cooking classes and all the gardening classes in our school district. So this is a typical menu. This is what we're serving this week at the schools. And you see these recipes on the side? Those are the recipes that the kids learn in my cooking classes. They do tastings of these ingredients in the gardening classes. They also may be growing them. And we serve them in the cafeterias. If we're going to change children's relationship to food, it's delicious, nutritious food in the cafeterias, hands-on experience \u2014 you're looking in cooking and gardening classes \u2014 and academic curriculum to tie it all together.Now you've probably garnered that I don't love the USDA, and I don't have any idea what to do with their pyramid, this upside-down pyramid with a rainbow over the top, I don't know. You know, run up into the end of the rainbow, I don't know what you do with it. So, I came up with my own. This is available on my website in English and Spanish, and it's a visual way to talk to kids about food. The really tiny hamburger, the really big vegetables. We have to start changing this. We have to make kids understand that their food choices make a big difference. We have cooking classes \u2014 we have cooking classrooms in our schools. And why this is so important is that we now have grown a generation, maybe two, of kids where one out of every four meals is eaten in fast food, one of every four meals is eaten in a car and one out of every last four meals is eaten in front of a TV or computer. What are kids learning? Where is the family time? Where is socialization? Where is discussion? Where is learning to talk? You know, we have to change it.I work with kids a lot. These are kids I work with in Harlem. EATWISE \u2014 Enlightened and Aware Teens Who Inspire Smart Eating. We have to teach kids that Coke and Pop Tarts aren't breakfast. We have to teach kids that if they're on a diet of refined sugar, they go up and down, just like if they're on a diet of crack. And we have to pull it all together. We have composting in all of our schools. We have recycling in all of our schools. You know, the things that we maybe do at home and think are so important, we have to teach kids about in school. It has to be so much a part of them that they really get it. Because, you know what, many of us are sort of at the end of our careers, and we need to be giving these kids \u2014 these young kids, the next generation \u2014 the tools to save themselves and save the planet.One of the things I do a lot is public-private partnerships. I work with private companies who are willing to do R & D with me, who are willing to do distribution for me, who are really willing to work to go into schools. Schools are underfunded. Most schools in America spend less than 7,500 dollars a year teaching a child. That comes down to under five dollars an hour. Most of you spend 10, 15 dollars an hour for babysitters when you have them. So we're spending less than 5 dollars an hour on the educational system. And if we're going to change it, and change how we feed kids, we really have to rethink that. So, public and private partnerships, advocacy groups, working with foundations. In our school district, the way we afford this is our school district allocates .03 percent of the general fund towards nutrition services. And I think if every school district allocated a half to one percent, we could start to really fix this program.We really need to change it. It's going to take more money. Of course, it's not all about food; it's also about kids getting exercise. And one of the simple things we can do is put recess before lunch. It's sort of this \"duh\" thing. You know, if you have kids coming into lunch and all they're going to do when they get out of lunch is go to have recess, you see them just throw away their lunch so they can run outside. And then, at one in the afternoon, they're totally crashing. These are your children and grandchildren that are totally melting down when you pick them up, because they haven't had lunch. So if the only thing they'd have to do after lunch is go to class, believe me, they're going to sit there and eat their lunch.We need to \u2014 we need to educate. We need to educate the kids. We need to educate the staff. I had 90 employees. Two were supposed to be cooks \u2014 none could. And, you know, I'm not that better off now. But we really have to educate. We have to get academic institutions to start thinking about ways to teach people how to cook again, because, of course, they don't \u2014 because we've had this processed food in schools and institutions for so long. We need 40-minute lunches \u2014 most schools have 20-minute lunches \u2014 and lunches that are time-appropriate. There was just a big study done, and so many schools are starting lunch at nine and 10 in the morning. That is not lunchtime.You know, it's crazy. It's crazy what we're doing. And just remember, at very least tacitly, this is what we're teaching children as what they should be doing. I think if we're going to fix this, one of the things we have to do is really change how we have oversight over the National School Lunch Program. Instead of the National School Lunch Program being under the USDA, I think it should be under CDC. If we started to think about food and how we feed our kids as a health initiative, and we started thinking about food as health, then I think we wouldn't have corn dogs as lunch.Okay, Finance 101 on this, and this \u2014 I'm sort of wrapping it up with this finance piece, because I think this is something we all have to understand. The National School Lunch Program spends 8 billion dollars feeding 30 million children a year. That number probably needs to double. People say, \"Oh my God, where are we going to get 8 billion?\" In this country, we're spending 110 billion dollars a year on fast food. We spend 100 billion dollars a year on diet aids. We spend 50 billion dollars on vegetables, which is why we need all the diet aids. We spend 200 billion dollars a year on diet-related illness today, with nine percent of our kids having type 2 diabetes. 200 billion.So you know what, when we talk about needing 8 billion more, it's not a lot. That 8 billion comes down to two dollars and 49 cents \u2014 that's what the government allocates for lunch. Most school districts spend two thirds of that on payroll and overhead. That means we spend less than a dollar a day on food for kids in schools \u2014 most schools, 80 to 90 cents. In L.A., it's 56 cents. So we're spending less than a dollar, OK, on lunch. Now I don't know about you, but I go to Starbucks and Pete's and places like that, and venti latte in San Francisco is five dollars. One gourmet coffee, one, is more \u2014 we spend more on than we are spending to feed kids for an entire week in our schools.You know what? We should be ashamed. We, as a country, should be ashamed at that. The richest country. In our country, it's the kids that need it the most, who get this really, really lousy food. It's the kids who have parents and grandparents and uncles and aunts that can't even afford to pay for school lunch that gets this food. And those are the same kids who are going to be getting sick. Those are the same kids who we should be taking care of.We can all make a difference. That every single one of us, whether we have children, whether we care about children, whether we have nieces or nephews, or anything \u2014 that we can make a difference. Whether you sit down and eat a meal with your kids, whether you take your kids, or grandchildren, or nieces and nephews shopping to a farmers' market. Just do tastings with them. Sit down and care. And on the macro level, we're in what seems to be a 19-month presidential campaign, and of all the things we're asking all of these potential leaders, what about asking for the health of our children?

So that's really what this is all about.\n\n00:01:44.958 --> 00:01:48.958\nThe way we got here is because of big agribusiness.\n\n00:01:48.958 --> 00:01:52.958\nWe now live in a country where most of us don't decide,\n\n00:01:52.958 --> 00:01:55.958\nby and large, what we eat. We see big businesses, Monsanto and DuPont,\n\n00:01:55.958 --> 00:01:58.958\nwho brought out Agent Orange and stain-resistant carpet.\n\n00:01:58.958 --> 00:02:02.958\nThey control 90 percent of the commercially produced seeds in our country.\n\n00:02:02.958 --> 00:02:04.958\nThese are -- 10 companies\n\n00:02:04.958 --> 00:02:06.958\ncontrol much of what's in our grocery stores,\n\n00:02:06.958 --> 00:02:10.958\nmuch of what people eat. And that's really, really a problem.\n\n00:02:10.958 --> 00:02:12.958\nSo when I started thinking about these issues\n\n00:02:12.958 --> 00:02:14.958\nand how I was going to change what kids ate,\n\n00:02:14.958 --> 00:02:17.958\nI really started focusing on what we would teach them.\n\n00:02:17.958 --> 00:02:19.958\nAnd the very first thing\n\n00:02:19.958 --> 00:02:22.958\nwas about regional food -- trying to eat food\n\n00:02:22.958 --> 00:02:24.958\nfrom within our region.\n\n00:02:24.958 --> 00:02:26.958\nAnd clearly, with what's going on with fossil fuel usage,\n\n00:02:26.958 --> 00:02:29.958\nor when -- as the fossil fuel is going away,\n\n00:02:29.958 --> 00:02:32.958\nas oil hits its peak oil,\n\n00:02:32.958 --> 00:02:34.958\nyou know, we really have to start thinking about whether or not\n\n00:02:34.958 --> 00:02:37.958\nwe should, or could, be moving food\n\n00:02:37.958 --> 00:02:40.958\n1,500 miles before we eat it.\n\n00:02:40.958 --> 00:02:42.958\nSo we talked to kids about that,\n\n00:02:42.958 --> 00:02:45.958\nand we really start to feed kids regional food.\n\n00:02:45.958 --> 00:02:47.958\nAnd then we talk about organic food.\n\n00:02:47.958 --> 00:02:49.958\nNow, most school districts can't really afford organic food,\n\n00:02:49.958 --> 00:02:51.958\nbut we, as a nation,\n\n00:02:51.958 --> 00:02:53.958\nhave to start thinking about\n\n00:02:53.958 --> 00:02:55.958\nconsuming, growing and feeding our children\n\n00:02:55.958 --> 00:02:57.958\nfood that's not chock-full of chemicals.\n\n00:02:57.958 --> 00:02:59.958\nWe can't keep feeding our kids pesticides\n\n00:02:59.958 --> 00:03:02.958\nand herbicides and antibiotics and hormones.\n\n00:03:02.958 --> 00:03:04.958\nWe can't keep doing that.\n\n00:03:04.958 --> 00:03:06.958\nYou know, it doesn't work.\n\n00:03:06.958 --> 00:03:09.958\nAnd the results of that are kids getting sick.\n\n00:03:09.958 --> 00:03:13.958\nOne of my big soapboxes right now is antibiotics.\n\n00:03:13.958 --> 00:03:17.958\nSeventy percent of all antibiotics consumed in America\n\n00:03:17.958 --> 00:03:19.958\nis consumed in animal husbandry.\n\n00:03:19.958 --> 00:03:22.958\nWe are feeding our kids antibiotics\n\n00:03:22.958 --> 00:03:25.958\nin beef and other animal protein every day.\n\n00:03:25.958 --> 00:03:28.958\nSeventy percent -- it's unbelievable.\n\n00:03:28.958 --> 00:03:31.958\nAnd the result of it is, we have diseases.\n\n00:03:31.958 --> 00:03:34.958\nWe have things like E. coli that we can't fix,\n\n00:03:34.958 --> 00:03:37.958\nthat we can't make kids better when they get sick.\n\n00:03:38.958 --> 00:03:42.958\nAnd, you know, certainly antibiotics have been over-prescribed,\n\n00:03:42.958 --> 00:03:44.958\nbut it's an issue in the food supply.\n\n00:03:44.958 --> 00:03:46.958\nOne of my favorite facts is that\n\n00:03:46.958 --> 00:03:50.958\nU.S. agriculture uses 1.2 billion pounds of pesticides every year.\n\n00:03:50.958 --> 00:03:53.958\nThat means every one of us, and our children,\n\n00:03:53.958 --> 00:03:55.958\nconsumes what would equal a five-pound bag --\n\n00:03:55.958 --> 00:03:57.958\nthose bags you have at home. If I had one here\n\n00:03:57.958 --> 00:03:59.958\nand ripped it open,\n\n00:03:59.958 --> 00:04:01.958\nand that pile I would have on the floor\n\n00:04:01.958 --> 00:04:04.958\nis what we consume and feed our children every year\n\n00:04:04.958 --> 00:04:07.958\nbecause of what goes into our food supply,\n\n00:04:07.958 --> 00:04:10.958\nbecause of the way we consume\n\n00:04:10.958 --> 00:04:12.958\nproduce in America.\n\n00:04:12.958 --> 00:04:14.958\nThe USDA allows these antibiotics,\n\n00:04:14.958 --> 00:04:16.958\nthese hormones and these pesticides in our food supply,\n\n00:04:16.958 --> 00:04:18.958\nand the USDA paid for this ad\n\n00:04:18.958 --> 00:04:20.958\nin Time magazine.\n\n00:04:20.958 --> 00:04:23.958\nOkay, we could talk about Rachel Carson and DDT,\n\n00:04:23.958 --> 00:04:25.958\nbut we know it wasn't good for you and me.\n\n00:04:25.958 --> 00:04:28.958\nAnd that is what the USDA allows in our food supply.\n\n00:04:28.958 --> 00:04:31.958\nAnd that has to change, you know.\n\n00:04:31.958 --> 00:04:33.958\nThe USDA cannot be seen as\n\n00:04:33.958 --> 00:04:36.958\nthe be-all and end-all of what we feed\n\n00:04:36.958 --> 00:04:38.958\nour kids and what's allowed.\n\n00:04:38.958 --> 00:04:41.958\nWe cannot believe that they have our best interests at heart.\n\n00:04:41.958 --> 00:04:44.958\nThe antithesis of this whole thing is sustainable food.\n\n00:04:44.958 --> 00:04:47.958\nThat's what I really try and get people to understand.\n\n00:04:47.958 --> 00:04:50.958\nI really try and teach it to kids.

They go to see Michelangelo's \"David,\" and when they finally come face to face with the statue, they both freeze dead in their tracks. The first guy \u2014 we'll call him Adam \u2014 is transfixed by the beauty of the perfect human form. The second guy \u2014 we'll call him Bill \u2014 is transfixed by embarrassment, at staring at the thing there in the center. So here's my question for you: which one of these two guys was more likely to have voted for George Bush, which for Al Gore?I don't need a show of hands because we all have the same political stereotypes. We all know that it's Bill. And in this case, the stereotype corresponds to reality. It really is a fact that liberals are much higher than conservatives on a major personality trait called openness to experience. People who are high in openness to experience just crave novelty, variety, diversity, new ideas, travel. People low on it like things that are familiar, that are safe and dependable.If you know about this trait, you can understand a lot of puzzles about human behavior. You can understand why artists are so different from accountants. You can actually predict what kinds of books they like to read, what kinds of places they like to travel to, and what kinds of food they like to eat. Once you understand this trait, you can understand why anybody would eat at Applebee's, but not anybody that you know. (Laughter) This trait also tells us a lot about politics. The main researcher of this trait, Robert McCrae says that, \"Open individuals have an affinity for liberal, progressive, left-wing political views\" \u2014 they like a society which is open and changing \u2014 \"whereas closed individuals prefer conservative, traditional, right-wing views.\"This trait also tells us a lot about the kinds of groups people join. So here's the description of a group I found on the Web. What kinds of people would join a global community welcoming people from every discipline and culture, who seek a deeper understanding of the world, and who hope to turn that understanding into a better future for us all? This is from some guy named Ted. (Laughter) Well, let's see now, if openness predicts who becomes liberal, and openness predicts who becomes a TEDster, then might we predict that most TEDsters are liberal? Let's find out. I'm going to ask you to raise your hand, whether you are liberal, left of center \u2014 on social issues, we're talking about, primarily \u2014 or conservative, and I'll give a third option, because I know there are a number of libertarians in the audience. So, right now, please raise your hand \u2014 down in the simulcast rooms, too, let's let everybody see who's here \u2014 please raise your hand if you would say that you are liberal or left of center. Please raise your hand high right now. OK. Please raise your hand if you'd say you're libertarian. OK, about a \u2014 two dozen. And please raise your hand if you'd say you are right of center or conservative. One, two, three, four, five \u2014 about eight or 10.OK. This is a bit of a problem. Because if our goal is to understand the world, to seek a deeper understanding of the world, our general lack of moral diversity here is going to make it harder. Because when people all share values, when people all share morals, they become a team, and once you engage the psychology of teams, it shuts down open-minded thinking. When the liberal team loses, as it did in 2004, and as it almost did in 2000, we comfort ourselves. (Laughter) We try to explain why half of America voted for the other team. We think they must be blinded by religion, or by simple stupidity. (Laughter) (Applause) So, if you think that half of America votes Republican because they are blinded in this way, then my message to you is that you're trapped in a moral matrix, in a particular moral matrix. And by the matrix, I mean literally the matrix, like the movie \"The Matrix.\"But I'm here today to give you a choice. You can either take the blue pill and stick to your comforting delusions, or you can take the red pill, learn some moral psychology and step outside the moral matrix. Now, because I know \u2014 (Applause) \u2014 OK, I assume that answers my question. I was going to ask you which one you picked, but no need. You're all high in openness to experience, and besides, it looks like it might even taste good, and you're all epicures. So anyway, let's go with the red pill. Let's study some moral psychology and see where it takes us.Let's start at the beginning. What is morality and where does it come from? The worst idea in all of psychology is the idea that the mind is a blank slate at birth. Developmental psychology has shown that kids come into the world already knowing so much about the physical and social worlds, and programmed to make it really easy for them to learn certain things and hard to learn others. The best definition of innateness I've ever seen \u2014 this just clarifies so many things for me \u2014 is from the brain scientist Gary Marcus. He says, \"The initial organization of the brain does not depend that much on experience. Nature provides a first draft, which experience then revises. Built-in doesn't mean unmalleable; it means organized in advance of experience.\" OK, so what's on the first draft of the moral mind? To find out, my colleague, Craig Joseph, and I read through the literature on anthropology, on culture variation in morality and also on evolutionary psychology, looking for matches. What are the sorts of things that people talk about across disciplines? That you find across cultures and even across species? We found five \u2014 five best matches, which we call the five foundations of morality.The first one is harm/care. We're all mammals here, we all have a lot of neural and hormonal programming that makes us really bond with others, care for others, feel compassion for others, especially the weak and vulnerable. It gives us very strong feelings about those who cause harm. This moral foundation underlies about 70 percent of the moral statements I've heard here at TED.The second foundation is fairness/reciprocity. There's actually ambiguous evidence as to whether you find reciprocity in other animals, but the evidence for people could not be clearer. This Norman Rockwell painting is called \"The Golden Rule,\" and we heard about this from Karen Armstrong, of course, as the foundation of so many religions. That second foundation underlies the other 30 percent of the moral statements I've heard here at TED.The third foundation is in-group/loyalty. You do find groups in the animal kingdom \u2014 you do find cooperative groups \u2014 but these groups are always either very small or they're all siblings. It's only among humans that you find very large groups of people who are able to cooperate, join together into groups, but in this case, groups that are united to fight other groups. This probably comes from our long history of tribal living, of tribal psychology. And this tribal psychology is so deeply pleasurable that even when we don't have tribes, we go ahead and make them, because it's fun. (Laughter) Sports is to war as pornography is to sex. We get to exercise some ancient, ancient drives.The fourth foundation is authority/respect. Here you see submissive gestures from two members of very closely related species. But authority in humans is not so closely based on power and brutality, as it is in other primates. It's based on more voluntary deference, and even elements of love, at times.The fifth foundation is purity/sanctity. This painting is called \"The Allegory Of Chastity,\" but purity's not just about suppressing female sexuality. It's about any kind of ideology, any kind of idea that tells you that you can attain virtue by controlling what you do with your body, by controlling what you put into your body. And while the political right may moralize sex much more, the political left is really doing a lot of it with food. Food is becoming extremely moralized nowadays, and a lot of it is ideas about purity, about what you're willing to touch, or put into your body.I believe these are the five best candidates for what's written on the first draft of the moral mind. I think this is what we come with, at least a preparedness to learn all of these things. But as my son, Max, grows up in a liberal college town, how is this first draft going to get revised? And how will it end up being different from a kid born 60 miles south of us in Lynchburg, Virginia? To think about culture variation, let's try a different metaphor. If there really are five systems at work in the mind \u2014 five sources of intuitions and emotions \u2014 then we can think of the moral mind as being like one of those audio equalizers that has five channels, where you can set it to a different setting on every channel. And my colleagues, Brian Nosek and Jesse Graham, and I, made a questionnaire, which we put up on the Web at www.YourMorals.org. And so far, 30,000 people have taken this questionnaire, and you can too. Here are the results. Here are the results from about 23,000 American citizens. On the left, I've plotted the scores for liberals; on the right, those for conservatives; in the middle, the moderates. The blue line shows you people's responses on the average of all the harm questions.So, as you see, people care about harm and care issues. They give high endorsement of these sorts of statements all across the board, but as you also see, liberals care about it a little more than conservatives \u2014 the line slopes down. Same story for fairness. But look at the other three lines. For liberals, the scores are very low. Liberals are basically saying, \"No, this is not morality. In-group, authority, purity \u2014 this stuff has nothing to do with morality. I reject it.\" But as people get more conservative, the values rise. We can say that liberals have a kind of a two-channel, or two-foundation morality. Conservatives have more of a five-foundation, or five-channel morality.We find this in every country we look at. Here's the data for 1,100 Canadians. I'll just flip through a few other slides. The U.K., Australia, New Zealand, Western Europe, Eastern Europe, Latin America, the Middle East, East Asia and South Asia. Notice also that on all of these graphs, the slope is steeper on in-group, authority, purity. Which shows that within any country, the disagreement isn't over harm and fairness. Everybody \u2014 I mean, we debate over what's fair \u2014 but everybody agrees that harm and fairness matter. Moral arguments within cultures are especially about issues of in-group, authority, purity.This effect is so robust that we find it no matter how we ask the question. In one recent study, we asked people to suppose you're about to get a dog. You picked a particular breed, you learned some new information about the breed. Suppose you learn that this particular breed is independent-minded, and relates to its owner as a friend and an equal? Well, if you are a liberal, you say, \"Hey, that's great!\" Because liberals like to say, \"Fetch, please.\" (Laughter) But if you're conservative, that's not so attractive. If you're conservative, and you learn that a dog's extremely loyal to its home and family, and doesn't warm up quickly to strangers, for conservatives, well, loyalty is good \u2014 dogs ought to be loyal. But to a liberal, it sounds like this dog is running for the Republican nomination. (Laughter)So, you might say, OK, there are these differences between liberals and conservatives, but what makes those three other foundations moral? Aren't those just the foundations of xenophobia and authoritarianism and Puritanism? What makes them moral? The answer, I think, is contained in this incredible triptych from Hieronymus Bosch, \"The Garden of Earthly Delights.\" In the first panel, we see the moment of creation. All is ordered, all is beautiful, all the people and animals are doing what they're supposed to be doing, where they're supposed to be. But then, given the way of the world, things change. We get every person doing whatever he wants, with every aperture of every other person and every other animal. Some of you might recognize this as the '60s. (Laughter) But the '60s inevitably gives way to the '70s, where the cuttings of the apertures hurt a little bit more. Of course, Bosch called this hell.So this triptych, these three panels portray the timeless truth that order tends to decay. The truth of social entropy. But lest you think this is just some part of the Christian imagination where Christians have this weird problem with pleasure, here's the same story, the same progression, told in a paper that was published in Nature a few years ago, in which Ernst Fehr and Simon Gachter had people play a commons dilemma. A game in which you give people money, and then, on each round of the game, they can put money into a common pot, and then the experimenter doubles what's in there, and then it's all divided among the players. So it's a really nice analog for all sorts of environmental issues, where we're asking people to make a sacrifice and they themselves don't really benefit from their own sacrifice. But you really want everybody else to sacrifice, but everybody has a temptation to a free ride. And what happens is that, at first, people start off reasonably cooperative \u2014 and this is all played anonymously. On the first round, people give about half of the money that they can. But they quickly see, \"You know what, other people aren't doing so much though. I don't want to be a sucker. I'm not going to cooperate.\" And so cooperation quickly decays from reasonably good, down to close to zero.But then \u2014 and here's the trick \u2014 Fehr and Gachter said, on the seventh round, they told people, \"You know what? New rule. If you want to give some of your own money to punish people who aren't contributing, you can do that.\" And as soon as people heard about the punishment issue going on, cooperation shoots up. It shoots up and it keeps going up. There's a lot of research showing that to solve cooperative problems, it really helps. It's not enough to just appeal to people's good motives. It really helps to have some sort of punishment. Even if it's just shame or embarrassment or gossip, you need some sort of punishment to bring people, when they're in large groups, to cooperate. There's even some recent research suggesting that religion \u2014 priming God, making people think about God \u2014 often, in some situations, leads to more cooperative, more pro-social behavior.Some people think that religion is an adaptation evolved both by cultural and biological evolution to make groups to cohere, in part for the purpose of trusting each other, and then being more effective at competing with other groups. I think that's probably right, although this is a controversial issue. But I'm particularly interested in religion, and the origin of religion, and in what it does to us and for us. Because I think that the greatest wonder in the world is not the Grand Canyon. The Grand Canyon is really simple. It's just a lot of rock, and then a lot of water and wind, and a lot of time, and you get the Grand Canyon. It's not that complicated. This is what's really complicated, that there were people living in places like the Grand Canyon, cooperating with each other, or on the savannahs of Africa, or on the frozen shores of Alaska, and then some of these villages grew into the mighty cities of Babylon, and Rome, and Tenochtitlan. How did this happen? This is an absolute miracle, much harder to explain than the Grand Canyon.The answer, I think, is that they used every tool in the toolbox. It took all of our moral psychology to create these cooperative groups. Yes, you do need to be concerned about harm, you do need a psychology of justice. But it really helps to organize a group if you can have sub-groups, and if those sub-groups have some internal structure, and if you have some ideology that tells people to suppress their carnality, to pursue higher, nobler ends. And now we get to the crux of the disagreement between liberals and conservatives. Because liberals reject three of these foundations. They say \"No, let's celebrate diversity, not common in-group membership.\" They say, \"Let's question authority.\" And they say, \"Keep your laws off my body.\"Liberals have very noble motives for doing this. Traditional authority, traditional morality can be quite repressive, and restrictive to those at the bottom, to women, to people that don't fit in. So liberals speak for the weak and oppressed. They want change and justice, even at the risk of chaos. This guy's shirt says, \"Stop bitching, start a revolution.\" If you're high in openness to experience, revolution is good, it's change, it's fun. Conservatives, on the other hand, speak for institutions and traditions. They want order, even at some cost to those at the bottom. The great conservative insight is that order is really hard to achieve. It's really precious, and it's really easy to lose. So as Edmund Burke said, \"The restraints on men, as well as their liberties, are to be reckoned among their rights.\" This was after the chaos of the French Revolution. So once you see this \u2014 once you see that liberals and conservatives both have something to contribute, that they form a balance on change versus stability \u2014 then I think the way is open to step outside the moral matrix.This is the great insight that all the Asian religions have attained. Think about yin and yang. Yin and yang aren't enemies. Yin and yang don't hate each other. Yin and yang are both necessary, like night and day, for the functioning of the world. You find the same thing in Hinduism. There are many high gods in Hinduism. Two of them are Vishnu, the preserver, and Shiva, the destroyer. This image actually is both of those gods sharing the same body. You have the markings of Vishnu on the left, so we could think of Vishnu as the conservative god. You have the markings of Shiva on the right, Shiva's the liberal god. And they work together. You find the same thing in Buddhism. These two stanzas contain, I think, the deepest insights that have ever been attained into moral psychology. From the Zen master Seng-ts'an: \"If you want the truth to stand clear before you, never be for or against. The struggle between for and against is the mind's worst disease.\" Now unfortunately, it's a disease that has been caught by many of the world's leaders. But before you feel superior to George Bush, before you throw a stone, ask yourself, do you accept this? Do you accept stepping out of the battle of good and evil? Can you be not for or against anything?So, what's the point? What should you do? Well, if you take the greatest insights from ancient Asian philosophies and religions, and you combine them with the latest research on moral psychology, I think you come to these conclusions: that our righteous minds were designed by evolution to unite us into teams, to divide us against other teams and then to blind us to the truth. So what should you do? Am I telling you to not strive? Am I telling you to embrace Seng-ts'an and stop, stop with this struggle of for and against? No, absolutely not. I'm not saying that. This is an amazing group of people who are doing so much, using so much of their talent, their brilliance, their energy, their money, to make the world a better place, to fight \u2014 to fight wrongs, to solve problems.But as we learned from Samantha Power, in her story about Sergio Vieira de Mello, you can't just go charging in, saying, \"You're wrong, and I'm right.\" Because, as we just heard, everybody thinks they are right. A lot of the problems we have to solve are problems that require us to change other people. And if you want to change other people, a much better way to do it is to first understand who we are \u2014 understand our moral psychology, understand that we all think we're right \u2014 and then step out, even if it's just for a moment, step out \u2014 check in with Seng-ts'an. Step out of the moral matrix, just try to see it as a struggle playing out, in which everybody does think they're right, and everybody, at least, has some reasons \u2014 even if you disagree with them \u2014 everybody has some reasons for what they're doing. Step out. And if you do that, that's the essential move to cultivate moral humility, to get yourself out of this self-righteousness, which is the normal human condition. Think about the Dalai Lama. Think about the enormous moral authority of the Dalai Lama \u2014 and it comes from his moral humility.So I think the point \u2014 the point of my talk, and I think the point of TED \u2014 is that this is a group that is passionately engaged in the pursuit of changing the world for the better. People here are passionately engaged in trying to make the world a better place. But there is also a passionate commitment to the truth. And so I think that the answer is to use that passionate commitment to the truth to try to turn it into a better future for us all. Thank you.

OK.\n\n00:02:41.958 --> 00:02:43.958\nPlease raise your hand if you'd say you're libertarian.\n\n00:02:44.958 --> 00:02:46.958\nOK, about a -- two dozen.\n\n00:02:46.958 --> 00:02:49.958\nAnd please raise your hand if you'd say you are right of center or conservative.\n\n00:02:49.958 --> 00:02:54.958\nOne, two, three, four, five -- about eight or 10.\n\n00:02:55.958 --> 00:02:58.958\nOK. This is a bit of a problem.\n\n00:02:58.958 --> 00:03:01.958\nBecause if our goal is to understand the world,\n\n00:03:01.958 --> 00:03:03.958\nto seek a deeper understanding of the world,\n\n00:03:03.958 --> 00:03:06.958\nour general lack of moral diversity here is going to make it harder.\n\n00:03:06.958 --> 00:03:10.958\nBecause when people all share values, when people all share morals,\n\n00:03:10.958 --> 00:03:13.958\nthey become a team, and once you engage the psychology of teams,\n\n00:03:13.958 --> 00:03:15.958\nit shuts down open-minded thinking.\n\n00:03:18.958 --> 00:03:22.958\nWhen the liberal team loses, as it did in 2004,\n\n00:03:22.958 --> 00:03:26.958\nand as it almost did in 2000, we comfort ourselves.\n\n00:03:26.958 --> 00:03:28.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:03:28.958 --> 00:03:32.958\nWe try to explain why half of America voted for the other team.\n\n00:03:32.958 --> 00:03:37.958\nWe think they must be blinded by religion, or by simple stupidity.\n\n00:03:37.958 --> 00:03:40.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:03:40.958 --> 00:03:48.958\n(Applause)\n\n00:03:48.958 --> 00:03:54.958\nSo, if you think that half of America votes Republican\n\n00:03:54.958 --> 00:03:57.958\nbecause they are blinded in this way,\n\n00:03:57.958 --> 00:04:00.958\nthen my message to you is that you're trapped in a moral matrix,\n\n00:04:00.958 --> 00:04:01.958\nin a particular moral matrix.\n\n00:04:01.958 --> 00:04:05.958\nAnd by the matrix, I mean literally the matrix, like the movie \"The Matrix.\"\n\n00:04:05.958 --> 00:04:07.958\nBut I'm here today to give you a choice.\n\n00:04:07.958 --> 00:04:11.958\nYou can either take the blue pill and stick to your comforting delusions,\n\n00:04:11.958 --> 00:04:13.958\nor you can take the red pill,\n\n00:04:13.958 --> 00:04:16.958\nlearn some moral psychology and step outside the moral matrix.\n\n00:04:16.958 --> 00:04:18.958\nNow, because I know --\n\n00:04:18.958 --> 00:04:21.958\n(Applause) --\n\n00:04:21.958 --> 00:04:23.958\nOK, I assume that answers my question.\n\n00:04:23.958 --> 00:04:25.958\nI was going to ask you which one you picked, but no need.\n\n00:04:25.958 --> 00:04:27.958\nYou're all high in openness to experience, and besides,\n\n00:04:27.958 --> 00:04:30.958\nit looks like it might even taste good, and you're all epicures.\n\n00:04:30.958 --> 00:04:32.958\nSo anyway, let's go with the red pill.\n\n00:04:32.958 --> 00:04:34.958\nLet's study some moral psychology and see where it takes us.\n\n00:04:34.958 --> 00:04:36.958\nLet's start at the beginning.\n\n00:04:36.958 --> 00:04:38.958\nWhat is morality and where does it come from?\n\n00:04:38.958 --> 00:04:40.958\nThe worst idea in all of psychology\n\n00:04:40.958 --> 00:04:43.958\nis the idea that the mind is a blank slate at birth.\n\n00:04:43.958 --> 00:04:45.958\nDevelopmental psychology has shown\n\n00:04:45.958 --> 00:04:47.958\nthat kids come into the world already knowing so much\n\n00:04:47.958 --> 00:04:49.958\nabout the physical and social worlds,\n\n00:04:49.958 --> 00:04:53.958\nand programmed to make it really easy for them to learn certain things\n\n00:04:53.958 --> 00:04:54.958\nand hard to learn others.\n\n00:04:54.958 --> 00:04:56.958\nThe best definition of innateness I've ever seen --\n\n00:04:56.958 --> 00:04:58.958\nthis just clarifies so many things for me --\n\n00:04:58.958 --> 00:05:00.958\nis from the brain scientist Gary Marcus.\n\n00:05:00.958 --> 00:05:05.958\nHe says, \"The initial organization of the brain does not depend that much on experience.\n\n00:05:05.958 --> 00:05:08.958\nNature provides a first draft, which experience then revises.\n\n00:05:08.958 --> 00:05:10.958\nBuilt-in doesn't mean unmalleable;\n\n00:05:10.958 --> 00:05:13.958\nit means organized in advance of experience.\"\n\n00:05:13.958 --> 00:05:15.958\nOK, so what's on the first draft of the moral mind?\n\n00:05:15.958 --> 00:05:18.958\nTo find out, my colleague, Craig Joseph, and I\n\n00:05:18.958 --> 00:05:20.958\nread through the literature on anthropology,\n\n00:05:20.958 --> 00:05:22.958\non culture variation in morality\n\n00:05:22.958 --> 00:05:24.958\nand also on evolutionary psychology, looking for matches.\n\n00:05:24.958 --> 00:05:27.958\nWhat are the sorts of things that people talk about across disciplines?\n\n00:05:27.958 --> 00:05:29.958\nThat you find across cultures and even across species?\n\n00:05:29.958 --> 00:05:31.958\nWe found five -- five best matches,\n\n00:05:31.958 --> 00:05:33.958\nwhich we call the five foundations of morality.\n\n00:05:33.958 --> 00:05:35.958\nThe first one is harm/care.\n\n00:05:35.958 --> 00:05:39.958\nWe're all mammals here, we all have a lot of neural and hormonal programming\n\n00:05:39.958 --> 00:05:41.958\nthat makes us really bond with others, care for others,\n\n00:05:41.958 --> 00:05:44.958\nfeel compassion for others, especially the weak and vulnerable.\n\n00:05:44.958 --> 00:05:47.958\nIt gives us very strong feelings about those who cause harm.\n\n00:05:47.958 --> 00:05:50.958\nThis moral foundation underlies about 70 percent\n\n00:05:50.958 --> 00:05:52.958\nof the moral statements I've heard here at TED.\n\n00:05:52.958 --> 00:05:55.958\nThe second foundation is fairness/reciprocity.\n\n00:05:55.958 --> 00:05:57.958\nThere's actually ambiguous evidence\n\n00:05:57.958 --> 00:05:59.958\nas to whether you find reciprocity in other animals,\n\n00:05:59.958 --> 00:06:01.958\nbut the evidence for people could not be clearer.\n\n00:06:01.958 --> 00:06:03.958\nThis Norman Rockwell painting is called \"The Golden Rule,\"\n\n00:06:03.958 --> 00:06:05.958\nand we heard about this from Karen Armstrong, of course,\n\n00:06:05.958 --> 00:06:08.958\nas the foundation of so many religions.\n\n00:06:08.958 --> 00:06:10.958\nThat second foundation underlies the other 30 percent\n\n00:06:10.958 --> 00:06:12.958\nof the moral statements I've heard here at TED.\n\n00:06:12.958 --> 00:06:14.958\nThe third foundation is in-group/loyalty.\n\n00:06:14.958 --> 00:06:16.958\nYou do find groups in the animal kingdom --\n\n00:06:16.958 --> 00:06:18.958\nyou do find cooperative groups --\n\n00:06:18.958 --> 00:06:21.958\nbut these groups are always either very small or they're all siblings.\n\n00:06:21.958 --> 00:06:24.958\nIt's only among humans that you find very large groups of people\n\n00:06:24.958 --> 00:06:27.958\nwho are able to cooperate, join together into groups,\n\n00:06:27.958 --> 00:06:31.958\nbut in this case, groups that are united to fight other groups.\n\n00:06:31.958 --> 00:06:35.958\nThis probably comes from our long history of tribal living, of tribal psychology.\n\n00:06:35.958 --> 00:06:37.958\nAnd this tribal psychology is so deeply pleasurable\n\n00:06:37.958 --> 00:06:39.958\nthat even when we don't have tribes,\n\n00:06:39.958 --> 00:06:42.958\nwe go ahead and make them, because it's fun.\n\n00:06:42.958 --> 00:06:45.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:06:45.958 --> 00:06:48.958\nSports is to war as pornography is to sex.\n\n00:06:48.958 --> 00:06:51.958\nWe get to exercise some ancient, ancient drives.\n\n00:06:51.958 --> 00:06:54.958\nThe fourth foundation is authority/respect.\n\n00:06:54.958 --> 00:06:57.958\nHere you see submissive gestures from two members of very closely related species.\n\n00:06:57.958 --> 00:07:01.958\nBut authority in humans is not so closely based on power and brutality,\n\n00:07:01.958 --> 00:07:03.958\nas it is in other primates.\n\n00:07:03.958 --> 00:07:05.958\nIt's based on more voluntary deference,\n\n00:07:05.958 --> 00:07:07.958\nand even elements of love, at times.\n\n00:07:07.958 --> 00:07:09.958\nThe fifth foundation is purity/sanctity.\n\n00:07:09.958 --> 00:07:12.958\nThis painting is called \"The Allegory Of Chastity,\"\n\n00:07:12.958 --> 00:07:15.958\nbut purity's not just about suppressing female sexuality.\n\n00:07:15.958 --> 00:07:18.958\nIt's about any kind of ideology, any kind of idea\n\n00:07:18.958 --> 00:07:20.958\nthat tells you that you can attain virtue\n\n00:07:20.958 --> 00:07:21.958\nby controlling what you do with your body,\n\n00:07:21.958 --> 00:07:23.958\nby controlling what you put into your body.\n\n00:07:23.958 --> 00:07:27.958\nAnd while the political right may moralize sex much more,\n\n00:07:27.958 --> 00:07:29.958\nthe political left is really doing a lot of it with food.\n\n00:07:29.958 --> 00:07:31.958\nFood is becoming extremely moralized nowadays,\n\n00:07:31.958 --> 00:07:33.958\nand a lot of it is ideas about purity,\n\n00:07:33.958 --> 00:07:36.958\nabout what you're willing to touch, or put into your body.\n\n00:07:36.958 --> 00:07:39.958\nI believe these are the five best candidates\n\n00:07:39.958 --> 00:07:41.958\nfor what's written on the first draft of the moral mind.\n\n00:07:41.958 --> 00:07:42.958\nI think this is what we come with, at least\n\n00:07:42.958 --> 00:07:45.958\na preparedness to learn all of these things.\n\n00:07:45.958 --> 00:07:48.958\nBut as my son, Max, grows up in a liberal college town,\n\n00:07:49.958 --> 00:07:51.958\nhow is this first draft going to get revised?\n\n00:07:51.958 --> 00:07:53.958\nAnd how will it end up being different\n\n00:07:53.958 --> 00:07:56.958\nfrom a kid born 60 miles south of us in Lynchburg, Virginia?\n\n00:07:56.958 --> 00:07:58.958\nTo think about culture variation, let's try a different metaphor.\n\n00:07:58.958 --> 00:08:01.958\nIf there really are five systems at work in the mind --\n\n00:08:01.958 --> 00:08:03.958\nfive sources of intuitions and emotions --\n\n00:08:03.958 --> 00:08:05.958\nthen we can think of the moral mind\n\n00:08:05.958 --> 00:08:07.958\nas being like one of those audio equalizers that has five channels,\n\n00:08:07.958 --> 00:08:09.958\nwhere you can set it to a different setting on every channel.\n\n00:08:09.958 --> 00:08:12.958\nAnd my colleagues, Brian Nosek and Jesse Graham, and I,\n\n00:08:12.958 --> 00:08:17.958\nmade a questionnaire, which we put up on the Web at www.YourMorals.org.\n\n00:08:17.958 --> 00:08:22.958\nAnd so far, 30,000 people have taken this questionnaire, and you can too.\n\n00:08:22.958 --> 00:08:23.958\nHere are the results.\n\n00:08:23.958 --> 00:08:26.958\nHere are the results from about 23,000 American citizens.\n\n00:08:26.958 --> 00:08:28.958\nOn the left, I've plotted the scores for liberals;\n\n00:08:28.958 --> 00:08:30.958\non the right, those for conservatives; in the middle, the moderates.\n\n00:08:30.958 --> 00:08:32.958\nThe blue line shows you people's responses\n\n00:08:32.958 --> 00:08:34.958\non the average of all the harm questions.\n\n00:08:34.958 --> 00:08:37.958\nSo, as you see, people care about harm and care issues.\n\n00:08:37.958 --> 00:08:39.958\nThey give high endorsement of these sorts of statements\n\n00:08:39.958 --> 00:08:41.958\nall across the board, but as you also see,\n\n00:08:41.958 --> 00:08:44.958\nliberals care about it a little more than conservatives -- the line slopes down.\n\n00:08:44.958 --> 00:08:46.958\nSame story for fairness.\n\n00:08:46.958 --> 00:08:48.958\nBut look at the other three lines.\n\n00:08:48.958 --> 00:08:50.958\nFor liberals, the scores are very low.\n\n00:08:50.958 --> 00:08:52.958\nLiberals are basically saying, \"No, this is not morality.\n\n00:08:52.958 --> 00:08:55.958\nIn-group, authority, purity -- this stuff has nothing to do with morality. I reject it.\"\n\n00:08:55.958 --> 00:08:57.958\nBut as people get more conservative, the values rise.\n\n00:08:57.958 --> 00:09:00.958\nWe can say that liberals have a kind of a two-channel,\n\n00:09:00.958 --> 00:09:01.958\nor two-foundation morality.\n\n00:09:01.958 --> 00:09:03.958\nConservatives have more of a five-foundation,\n\n00:09:03.958 --> 00:09:05.958\nor five-channel morality.\n\n00:09:05.958 --> 00:09:06.958\nWe find this in every country we look at.\n\n00:09:06.958 --> 00:09:08.958\nHere's the data for 1,100 Canadians.\n\n00:09:08.958 --> 00:09:10.958\nI'll just flip through a few other slides.\n\n00:09:10.958 --> 00:09:13.958\nThe U.K., Australia, New Zealand, Western Europe, Eastern Europe,\n\n00:09:13.958 --> 00:09:17.958\nLatin America, the Middle East, East Asia and South Asia.\n\n00:09:17.958 --> 00:09:19.958\nNotice also that on all of these graphs,\n\n00:09:19.958 --> 00:09:22.958\nthe slope is steeper on in-group, authority, purity.\n\n00:09:22.958 --> 00:09:24.958\nWhich shows that within any country,\n\n00:09:24.958 --> 00:09:27.958\nthe disagreement isn't over harm and fairness.\n\n00:09:27.958 --> 00:09:29.958\nEverybody -- I mean, we debate over what's fair --\n\n00:09:29.958 --> 00:09:32.958\nbut everybody agrees that harm and fairness matter.\n\n00:09:32.958 --> 00:09:34.958\nMoral arguments within cultures\n\n00:09:34.958 --> 00:09:37.958\nare especially about issues of in-group, authority, purity.\n\n00:09:37.958 --> 00:09:40.958\nThis effect is so robust that we find it no matter how we ask the question.\n\n00:09:40.958 --> 00:09:42.958\nIn one recent study,\n\n00:09:42.958 --> 00:09:44.958\nwe asked people to suppose you're about to get a dog.\n\n00:09:44.958 --> 00:09:45.958\nYou picked a particular breed,\n\n00:09:45.958 --> 00:09:47.958\nyou learned some new information about the breed.\n\n00:09:47.958 --> 00:09:50.958\nSuppose you learn that this particular breed is independent-minded,\n\n00:09:50.958 --> 00:09:52.958\nand relates to its owner as a friend and an equal?\n\n00:09:52.958 --> 00:09:54.958\nWell, if you are a liberal, you say, \"Hey, that's great!\"\n\n00:09:54.958 --> 00:09:56.958\nBecause liberals like to say, \"Fetch, please.\"\n\n00:09:56.958 --> 00:10:00.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:10:01.958 --> 00:10:04.958\nBut if you're conservative, that's not so attractive.\n\n00:10:04.958 --> 00:10:07.958\nIf you're conservative, and you learn that a dog's extremely loyal\n\n00:10:07.958 --> 00:10:09.958\nto its home and family, and doesn't warm up quickly to strangers,\n\n00:10:09.958 --> 00:10:12.958\nfor conservatives, well, loyalty is good -- dogs ought to be loyal.\n\n00:10:12.958 --> 00:10:14.958\nBut to a liberal, it sounds like this dog\n\n00:10:14.958 --> 00:10:16.958\nis running for the Republican nomination.\n\n00:10:16.958 --> 00:10:17.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:10:17.958 --> 00:10:19.958\nSo, you might say, OK,\n\n00:10:19.958 --> 00:10:21.958\nthere are these differences between liberals and conservatives,\n\n00:10:21.958 --> 00:10:23.958\nbut what makes those three other foundations moral?\n\n00:10:23.958 --> 00:10:25.958\nAren't those just the foundations of xenophobia\n\n00:10:25.958 --> 00:10:27.958\nand authoritarianism and Puritanism?\n\n00:10:27.958 --> 00:10:28.958\nWhat makes them moral?\n\n00:10:28.958 --> 00:10:31.958\nThe answer, I think, is contained in this incredible triptych from Hieronymus Bosch,\n\n00:10:31.958 --> 00:10:33.958\n\"The Garden of Earthly Delights.\"\n\n00:10:33.958 --> 00:10:36.958\nIn the first panel, we see the moment of creation.\n\n00:10:36.958 --> 00:10:40.958\nAll is ordered, all is beautiful, all the people and animals\n\n00:10:40.958 --> 00:10:43.958\nare doing what they're supposed to be doing, where they're supposed to be.\n\n00:10:43.958 --> 00:10:46.958\nBut then, given the way of the world, things change.\n\n00:10:46.958 --> 00:10:48.958\nWe get every person doing whatever he wants,\n\n00:10:48.958 --> 00:10:51.958\nwith every aperture of every other person and every other animal.\n\n00:10:51.958 --> 00:10:53.958\nSome of you might recognize this as the '60s.\n\n00:10:53.958 --> 00:10:54.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:10:54.958 --> 00:10:58.958\nBut the '60s inevitably gives way to the '70s,\n\n00:10:58.958 --> 00:11:02.958\nwhere the cuttings of the apertures hurt a little bit more.\n\n00:11:02.958 --> 00:11:04.958\nOf course, Bosch called this hell.\n\n00:11:04.958 --> 00:11:07.958\nSo this triptych, these three panels\n\n00:11:07.958 --> 00:11:12.958\nportray the timeless truth that order tends to decay.\n\n00:11:12.958 --> 00:11:14.958\nThe truth of social entropy.\n\n00:11:14.958 --> 00:11:17.958\nBut lest you think this is just some part of the Christian imagination\n\n00:11:17.958 --> 00:11:19.958\nwhere Christians have this weird problem with pleasure,\n\n00:11:19.958 --> 00:11:22.958\nhere's the same story, the same progression,\n\n00:11:22.958 --> 00:11:25.958\ntold in a paper that was published in Nature a few years ago,\n\n00:11:25.958 --> 00:11:29.958\nin which Ernst Fehr and Simon Gachter had people play a commons dilemma.\n\n00:11:29.958 --> 00:11:31.958\nA game in which you give people money,\n\n00:11:31.958 --> 00:11:33.958\nand then, on each round of the game,\n\n00:11:33.958 --> 00:11:35.958\nthey can put money into a common pot,\n\n00:11:35.958 --> 00:11:37.958\nand then the experimenter doubles what's in there,\n\n00:11:37.958 --> 00:11:39.958\nand then it's all divided among the players.\n\n00:11:39.958 --> 00:11:42.958\nSo it's a really nice analog for all sorts of environmental issues,\n\n00:11:42.958 --> 00:11:44.958\nwhere we're asking people to make a sacrifice\n\n00:11:44.958 --> 00:11:46.958\nand they themselves don't really benefit from their own sacrifice.\n\n00:11:46.958 --> 00:11:48.958\nBut you really want everybody else to sacrifice,\n\n00:11:48.958 --> 00:11:50.958\nbut everybody has a temptation to a free ride.\n\n00:11:50.958 --> 00:11:54.958\nAnd what happens is that, at first, people start off reasonably cooperative --\n\n00:11:54.958 --> 00:11:56.958\nand this is all played anonymously.\n\n00:11:56.958 --> 00:11:59.958\nOn the first round, people give about half of the money that they can.\n\n00:11:59.958 --> 00:12:02.958\nBut they quickly see, \"You know what, other people aren't doing so much though.\n\n00:12:02.958 --> 00:12:04.958\nI don't want to be a sucker. I'm not going to cooperate.\"\n\n00:12:04.958 --> 00:12:08.958\nAnd so cooperation quickly decays from reasonably good, down to close to zero.\n\n00:12:08.958 --> 00:12:10.958\nBut then -- and here's the trick --\n\n00:12:10.958 --> 00:12:12.958\nFehr and Gachter said, on the seventh round, they told people,\n\n00:12:12.958 --> 00:12:14.958\n\"You know what? New rule.\n\n00:12:14.958 --> 00:12:16.958\nIf you want to give some of your own money\n\n00:12:16.958 --> 00:12:20.958\nto punish people who aren't contributing, you can do that.\"\n\n00:12:20.958 --> 00:12:23.958\nAnd as soon as people heard about the punishment issue going on,\n\n00:12:23.958 --> 00:12:25.958\ncooperation shoots up.\n\n00:12:25.958 --> 00:12:27.958\nIt shoots up and it keeps going up.\n\n00:12:27.958 --> 00:12:30.958\nThere's a lot of research showing that to solve cooperative problems, it really helps.\n\n00:12:30.958 --> 00:12:32.958\nIt's not enough to just appeal to people's good motives.\n\n00:12:32.958 --> 00:12:34.958\nIt really helps to have some sort of punishment.\n\n00:12:34.958 --> 00:12:36.958\nEven if it's just shame or embarrassment or gossip,\n\n00:12:36.958 --> 00:12:39.958\nyou need some sort of punishment to bring people,\n\n00:12:39.958 --> 00:12:41.958\nwhen they're in large groups, to cooperate.\n\n00:12:41.958 --> 00:12:44.958\nThere's even some recent research suggesting that religion --\n\n00:12:44.958 --> 00:12:46.958\npriming God, making people think about God --\n\n00:12:46.958 --> 00:12:51.958\noften, in some situations, leads to more cooperative, more pro-social behavior.\n\n00:12:52.958 --> 00:12:54.958\nSome people think that religion is an adaptation\n\n00:12:54.958 --> 00:12:56.958\nevolved both by cultural and biological evolution\n\n00:12:56.958 --> 00:12:58.958\nto make groups to cohere,\n\n00:12:58.958 --> 00:13:00.958\nin part for the purpose of trusting each other,\n\n00:13:00.958 --> 00:13:02.958\nand then being more effective at competing with other groups.\n\n00:13:02.958 --> 00:13:03.958\nI think that's probably right,\n\n00:13:03.958 --> 00:13:05.958\nalthough this is a controversial issue.\n\n00:13:05.958 --> 00:13:07.958\nBut I'm particularly interested in religion,\n\n00:13:07.958 --> 00:13:10.958\nand the origin of religion, and in what it does to us and for us.\n\n00:13:10.958 --> 00:13:14.958\nBecause I think that the greatest wonder in the world is not the Grand Canyon.\n\n00:13:14.958 --> 00:13:16.958\nThe Grand Canyon is really simple.\n\n00:13:16.958 --> 00:13:19.958\nIt's just a lot of rock, and then a lot of water and wind, and a lot of time,\n\n00:13:19.958 --> 00:13:21.958\nand you get the Grand Canyon.\n\n00:13:21.958 --> 00:13:22.958\nIt's not that complicated.\n\n00:13:22.958 --> 00:13:24.958\nThis is what's really complicated,\n\n00:13:24.958 --> 00:13:26.958\nthat there were people living in places like the Grand Canyon,\n\n00:13:26.958 --> 00:13:28.958\ncooperating with each other, or on the savannahs of Africa,\n\n00:13:28.958 --> 00:13:31.958\nor on the frozen shores of Alaska, and then some of these villages\n\n00:13:31.958 --> 00:13:35.958\ngrew into the mighty cities of Babylon, and Rome, and Tenochtitlan.\n\n00:13:35.958 --> 00:13:36.958\nHow did this happen?\n\n00:13:36.958 --> 00:13:39.958\nThis is an absolute miracle, much harder to explain than the Grand Canyon.\n\n00:13:39.958 --> 00:13:42.958\nThe answer, I think, is that they used every tool in the toolbox.\n\n00:13:42.958 --> 00:13:44.958\nIt took all of our moral psychology\n\n00:13:44.958 --> 00:13:46.958\nto create these cooperative groups.\n\n00:13:46.958 --> 00:13:48.958\nYes, you do need to be concerned about harm,\n\n00:13:48.958 --> 00:13:49.958\nyou do need a psychology of justice.\n\n00:13:49.958 --> 00:13:52.958\nBut it really helps to organize a group if you can have sub-groups,\n\n00:13:52.958 --> 00:13:55.958\nand if those sub-groups have some internal structure,\n\n00:13:55.958 --> 00:13:57.958\nand if you have some ideology that tells people\n\n00:13:57.958 --> 00:14:01.958\nto suppress their carnality, to pursue higher, nobler ends.\n\n00:14:01.958 --> 00:14:03.958\nAnd now we get to the crux of the disagreement\n\n00:14:03.958 --> 00:14:05.958\nbetween liberals and conservatives.\n\n00:14:05.958 --> 00:14:07.958\nBecause liberals reject three of these foundations.\n\n00:14:07.958 --> 00:14:10.958\nThey say \"No, let's celebrate diversity, not common in-group membership.\"\n\n00:14:10.958 --> 00:14:12.958\nThey say, \"Let's question authority.\"\n\n00:14:12.958 --> 00:14:14.958\nAnd they say, \"Keep your laws off my body.\"\n\n00:14:14.958 --> 00:14:17.958\nLiberals have very noble motives for doing this.\n\n00:14:17.958 --> 00:14:20.958\nTraditional authority, traditional morality can be quite repressive,\n\n00:14:20.958 --> 00:14:23.958\nand restrictive to those at the bottom, to women, to people that don't fit in.\n\n00:14:23.958 --> 00:14:25.958\nSo liberals speak for the weak and oppressed.\n\n00:14:25.958 --> 00:14:27.958\nThey want change and justice, even at the risk of chaos.\n\n00:14:27.958 --> 00:14:30.958\nThis guy's shirt says, \"Stop bitching, start a revolution.\"\n\n00:14:30.958 --> 00:14:32.958\nIf you're high in openness to experience, revolution is good,\n\n00:14:32.958 --> 00:14:34.958\nit's change, it's fun.\n\n00:14:34.958 --> 00:14:37.958\nConservatives, on the other hand, speak for institutions and traditions.\n\n00:14:37.958 --> 00:14:41.958\nThey want order, even at some cost to those at the bottom.\n\n00:14:41.958 --> 00:14:43.958\nThe great conservative insight is that order is really hard to achieve.\n\n00:14:43.958 --> 00:14:46.958\nIt's really precious, and it's really easy to lose.\n\n00:14:46.958 --> 00:14:48.958\nSo as Edmund Burke said, \"The restraints on men,\n\n00:14:48.958 --> 00:14:51.958\nas well as their liberties, are to be reckoned among their rights.\"\n\n00:14:51.958 --> 00:14:53.958\nThis was after the chaos of the French Revolution.\n\n00:14:53.958 --> 00:14:55.958\nSo once you see this -- once you see\n\n00:14:55.958 --> 00:14:58.958\nthat liberals and conservatives both have something to contribute,\n\n00:14:58.958 --> 00:15:01.958\nthat they form a balance on change versus stability --\n\n00:15:01.958 --> 00:15:04.958\nthen I think the way is open to step outside the moral matrix.\n\n00:15:04.958 --> 00:15:09.958\nThis is the great insight that all the Asian religions have attained.\n\n00:15:09.958 --> 00:15:11.958\nThink about yin and yang.\n\n00:15:11.958 --> 00:15:13.958\nYin and yang aren't enemies. Yin and yang don't hate each other.\n\n00:15:13.958 --> 00:15:15.958\nYin and yang are both necessary, like night and day,\n\n00:15:15.958 --> 00:15:17.958\nfor the functioning of the world.\n\n00:15:17.958 --> 00:15:19.958\nYou find the same thing in Hinduism.\n\n00:15:19.958 --> 00:15:21.958\nThere are many high gods in Hinduism.\n\n00:15:21.958 --> 00:15:24.958\nTwo of them are Vishnu, the preserver, and Shiva, the destroyer.\n\n00:15:24.958 --> 00:15:27.958\nThis image actually is both of those gods sharing the same body.\n\n00:15:27.958 --> 00:15:29.958\nYou have the markings of Vishnu on the left,\n\n00:15:29.958 --> 00:15:32.958\nso we could think of Vishnu as the conservative god.\n\n00:15:32.958 --> 00:15:34.958\nYou have the markings of Shiva on the right,\n\n00:15:34.958 --> 00:15:36.958\nShiva's the liberal god. And they work together.\n\n00:15:36.958 --> 00:15:38.958\nYou find the same thing in Buddhism.\n\n00:15:38.958 --> 00:15:40.958\nThese two stanzas contain, I think, the deepest insights\n\n00:15:40.958 --> 00:15:43.958\nthat have ever been attained into moral psychology.\n\n00:15:43.958 --> 00:15:45.958\nFrom the Zen master Seng-ts'an:\n\n00:15:45.958 --> 00:15:49.958\n\"If you want the truth to stand clear before you, never be for or against.\n\n00:15:49.958 --> 00:15:53.958\nThe struggle between for and against is the mind's worst disease.\"\n\n00:15:53.958 --> 00:15:55.958\nNow unfortunately, it's a disease\n\n00:15:55.958 --> 00:15:57.958\nthat has been caught by many of the world's leaders.\n\n00:15:57.958 --> 00:16:00.958\nBut before you feel superior to George Bush,\n\n00:16:00.958 --> 00:16:04.958\nbefore you throw a stone, ask yourself, do you accept this?\n\n00:16:04.958 --> 00:16:07.958\nDo you accept stepping out of the battle of good and evil?\n\n00:16:07.958 --> 00:16:10.958\nCan you be not for or against anything?\n\n00:16:11.958 --> 00:16:14.958\nSo, what's the point? What should you do?\n\n00:16:14.958 --> 00:16:16.958\nWell, if you take the greatest insights\n\n00:16:16.958 --> 00:16:18.958\nfrom ancient Asian philosophies and religions,\n\n00:16:18.958 --> 00:16:20.958\nand you combine them with the latest research on moral psychology,\n\n00:16:20.958 --> 00:16:22.958\nI think you come to these conclusions:\n\n00:16:22.958 --> 00:16:26.958\nthat our righteous minds were designed by evolution\n\n00:16:26.958 --> 00:16:29.958\nto unite us into teams, to divide us against other teams\n\n00:16:29.958 --> 00:16:31.958\nand then to blind us to the truth.\n\n00:16:32.958 --> 00:16:36.958\nSo what should you do? Am I telling you to not strive?\n\n00:16:36.958 --> 00:16:39.958\nAm I telling you to embrace Seng-ts'an and stop,\n\n00:16:39.958 --> 00:16:42.958\nstop with this struggle of for and against?\n\n00:16:42.958 --> 00:16:44.958\nNo, absolutely not. I'm not saying that.\n\n00:16:44.958 --> 00:16:47.958\nThis is an amazing group of people who are doing so much,\n\n00:16:47.958 --> 00:16:51.958\nusing so much of their talent, their brilliance, their energy, their money,\n\n00:16:51.958 --> 00:16:53.958\nto make the world a better place, to fight --\n\n00:16:53.958 --> 00:16:56.958\nto fight wrongs, to solve problems.\n\n00:16:57.958 --> 00:17:01.958\nBut as we learned from Samantha Power, in her story\n\n00:17:01.958 --> 00:17:06.958\nabout Sergio Vieira de Mello, you can't just go charging in,\n\n00:17:06.958 --> 00:17:08.958\nsaying, \"You're wrong, and I'm right.\"\n\n00:17:08.958 --> 00:17:12.958\nBecause, as we just heard, everybody thinks they are right.\n\n00:17:12.958 --> 00:17:14.958\nA lot of the problems we have to solve\n\n00:17:14.958 --> 00:17:17.958\nare problems that require us to change other people.\n\n00:17:17.958 --> 00:17:20.958\nAnd if you want to change other people, a much better way to do it\n\n00:17:20.958 --> 00:17:24.958\nis to first understand who we are -- understand our moral psychology,\n\n00:17:24.958 --> 00:17:27.958\nunderstand that we all think we're right -- and then step out,\n\n00:17:27.958 --> 00:17:31.958\neven if it's just for a moment, step out -- check in with Seng-ts'an.\n\n00:17:31.958 --> 00:17:33.958\nStep out of the moral matrix,\n\n00:17:33.958 --> 00:17:35.958\njust try to see it as a struggle playing out,\n\n00:17:35.958 --> 00:17:37.958\nin which everybody does think they're right,\n\n00:17:37.958 --> 00:17:39.958\nand everybody, at least, has some reasons -- even if you disagree with them --\n\n00:17:39.958 --> 00:17:41.958\neverybody has some reasons for what they're doing.\n\n00:17:41.958 --> 00:17:42.958\nStep out.\n\n00:17:42.958 --> 00:17:46.958\nAnd if you do that, that's the essential move to cultivate moral humility,\n\n00:17:46.958 --> 00:17:47.958\nto get yourself out of this self-righteousness,\n\n00:17:47.958 --> 00:17:49.958\nwhich is the normal human condition.\n\n00:17:49.958 --> 00:17:51.958\nThink about the Dalai Lama.\n\n00:17:51.958 --> 00:17:54.958\nThink about the enormous moral authority of the Dalai Lama --\n\n00:17:54.958 --> 00:17:56.958\nand it comes from his moral humility.\n\n00:17:58.958 --> 00:18:00.958\nSo I think the point -- the point of my talk,\n\n00:18:00.958 --> 00:18:03.958\nand I think the point of TED --\n\n00:18:03.958 --> 00:18:06.958\nis that this is a group that is passionately engaged\n\n00:18:06.958 --> 00:18:08.958\nin the pursuit of changing the world for the better.\n\n00:18:08.958 --> 00:18:11.958\nPeople here are passionately engaged\n\n00:18:11.958 --> 00:18:13.958\nin trying to make the world a better place.\n\n00:18:13.958 --> 00:18:16.958\nBut there is also a passionate commitment to the truth.\n\n00:18:16.958 --> 00:18:20.958\nAnd so I think that the answer is to use that passionate commitment\n\n00:18:20.958 --> 00:18:24.958\nto the truth to try to turn it into a better future for us all.\n\n00:18:24.958 --> 00:18:25.958\nThank you.\n\n00:18:25.958 --> 00:18:28.958\n(Applause)"}, {"title": "What security means to me", "duration": "825", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/eve_ensler_on_security", "transcript": "I think it'll be a relief to some people and a disappointment to others that I'm not going to talk about vaginas today. I began \"The Vagina Monologues\" because I was worried about vaginas. I'm very worried today about this notion, this world, this prevailing kind of force of security. I see this word, hear this word, feel this word everywhere. Real security, security checks, security watch, security clearance. Why has all this focus on security made me feel so much more insecure? What does anyone mean when they talk about real security? And why have we, as Americans particularly, become a nation that strives for security above all else? In fact, I think that security is elusive. It's impossible. We all die. We all get old. We all get sick. People leave us. People change us. Nothing is secure. And that's actually the good news.This is, of course, unless your whole life is about being secure. I think that when that is the focus of your life, these are the things that happen. You can't travel very far or venture too far outside a certain circle. You can't allow too many conflicting ideas into your mind at one time, as they might confuse you or challenge you. You can't open yourself to new experiences, new people, new ways of doing things \u2014 they might take you off course. You can't not know who you are, so you cling to hard-matter identity. You become a Christian, Muslim, Jew. You're an Indian, Egyptian, Italian, American. You're a heterosexual or a homosexual, or you never have sex. Or at least, that's what you say when you identify yourself. You become part of an \"us.\" In order to be secure, you defend against \"them.\" You cling to your land because it is your secure place. You must fight anyone who encroaches upon it. You become your nation. You become your religion. You become whatever it is that will freeze you, numb you and protect you from doubt or change. But all this does, actually, is shut down your mind. In reality, it does not really make you safer.I was in Sri Lanka, for example, three days after the tsunami, and I was standing on the beaches and it was absolutely clear that, in a matter of five minutes, a 30-foot wave could rise up and desecrate a people, a population and lives. All this striving for security, in fact, has made you much more insecure because now you have to watch out all the time. There are people not like you \u2014 people who you now call enemies. You have places you cannot go, thoughts you cannot think, worlds that you can no longer inhabit. And so you spend your days fighting things off, defending your territory and becoming more entrenched in your fundamental thinking. Your days become devoted to protecting yourself. This becomes your mission. That is all you do. Ideas get shorter. They become sound bytes. There are evildoers and saints, criminals and victims.There are those who, if they're not with us, are against us. It gets easier to hurt people because you do not feel what's inside them. It gets easier to lock them up, force them to be naked, humiliate them, occupy them, invade them and kill them, because they are only obstacles now to your security. In six years, I've had the extraordinary privilege through V-Day, a global movement against [violence against] women, to travel probably to 60 countries, and spend a great deal of time in different portions. I've met women and men all over this planet, who through various circumstances \u2014 war, poverty, racism, multiple forms of violence \u2014 have never known security, or have had their illusion of security forever devastated. I've spent time with women in Afghanistan under the Taliban, who were essentially brutalized and censored. I've been in Bosnian refugee camps. I was with women in Pakistan who have had their faces melted off with acid. I've been with girls all across America who were date-raped, or raped by their best friends when they were drugged one night.One of the amazing things that I've discovered in my travels is that there is this emerging species. I loved when he was talking about this other world that's right next to this world. I've discovered these people, who, in V-Day world, we call Vagina Warriors. These particular people, rather than getting AK-47s, or weapons of mass destruction, or machetes, in the spirit of the warrior, have gone into the center, the heart of pain, of loss. They have grieved it, they have died into it, and allowed and encouraged poison to turn into medicine. They have used the fuel of their pain to begin to redirect that energy towards another mission and another trajectory.These warriors now devote themselves and their lives to making sure what happened to them doesn't happen to anyone else. There are thousands if not millions of them on the planet. I venture there are many in this room. They have a fierceness and a freedom that I believe is the bedrock of a new paradigm. They have broken out of the existing frame of victim and perpetrator. Their own personal security is not their end goal, and because of that, because, rather than worrying about security, because the transformation of suffering is their end goal, I actually believe they are creating real safety and a whole new idea of security. I want to talk about a few of these people that I've met.Tomorrow, I am going to Cairo, and I'm so moved that I will be with women in Cairo who are V-Day women, who are opening the first safe house for battered women in the Middle East. That will happen because women in Cairo made a decision to stand up and put themselves on the line, and talk about the degree of violence that is happening in Egypt, and were willing to be attacked and criticized. And through their work over the last years, this is not only happening that this house is opening, but it's being supported by many factions of the society who never would have supported it. Women in Uganda this year, who put on \"The Vagina Monologues\" during V-Day, actually evoked the wrath of the government.And, I love this story so much. There was a cabinet meeting and a meeting of the presidents to talk about whether \"Vaginas\" could come to Uganda. And in this meeting \u2014 it went on for weeks in the press, two weeks where there was huge discussion. The government finally made a decision that \"The Vagina Monologues\" could not be performed in Uganda. But the amazing news was that because they had stood up, these women, and because they had been willing to risk their security, it began a discussion that not only happened in Uganda, but all of Africa. As a result, this production, which had already sold out, every single person in that 800-seat audience, except for 10 people, made a decision to keep the money. They raised 10,000 dollars on a production that never occurred.There's a young woman named Carrie Rethlefsen in Minnesota. She's a high school student. She had seen \"The Vagina Monologues\" and she was really moved. And as a result, she wore an \"I heart my vagina\" button to her high school in Minnesota.(Laughter)She was basically threatened to be expelled from school. They told her she couldn't love her vagina in high school, that it was not a legal thing, that it was not a moral thing, that it was not a good thing. So she really struggled with this, what to do, because she was a senior and she was doing well in her school and she was threatened expulsion. So what she did is she got all her friends together \u2014 I believe it was 100, 150 students all wore \"I love my vagina\" T-shirts, and the boys wore \"I love her vagina\" T-shirts to school.(Laughter)Now this seems like a fairly, you know, frivolous, but what happened as a result of that, is that that school now is forming a sex education class. It's beginning to talk about sex, it's beginning to look at why it would be wrong for a young high school girl to talk about her vagina publicly or to say that she loved her vagina publicly.I know I've talked about Agnes here before, but I want to give you an update on Agnes. I met Agnes three years ago in the Rift Valley. When she was a young girl, she had been mutilated against her will. That mutilation of her clitoris had actually obviously impacted her life and changed it in a way that was devastating. She made a decision not to go and get a razor or a glass shard, but to devote her life to stopping that happening to other girls. For eight years, she walked through the Rift Valley. She had this amazing box that she carried and it had a torso of a woman's body in it, a half a torso, and she would teach people, everywhere she went, what a healthy vagina looked like and what a mutilated vagina looked like. In the years that she walked, she educated parents, mothers, fathers. She saved 1,500 girls from being cut.When V-Day met her, we asked her how we could support her and she said, \"Well, if you got me a Jeep, I could get around a lot faster.\" So, we bought her a Jeep. In the year she had the Jeep, she saved 4,500 girls from being cut. So, we said, what else could we do? She said, \"If you help me get money, I could open a house.\" Three years ago, Agnes opened a safe house in Africa to stop mutilation. When she began her mission eight years ago, she was reviled, she was detested, she was completely slandered in her community. I am proud to tell you that six months ago, she was elected the deputy mayor of Narok.(Applause)I think what I'm trying to say here is that if your end goal is security, and if that's all you're focusing on, what ends up happening is that you create not only more insecurity in other people, but you make yourself far more insecure. Real security is contemplating death, not pretending it doesn't exist. Not running from loss, but entering grief, surrendering to sorrow. Real security is not knowing something, when you don't know it. Real security is hungering for connection rather than power. It cannot be bought or arranged or made with bombs. It is deeper, it is a process, it is acute awareness that we are all utterly inter-bended, and one action by one being in one tiny town has consequences everywhere. Real security is not only being able to tolerate mystery, complexity, ambiguity, but hungering for them and only trusting a situation when they are present.Something happened when I began traveling in V-Day, eight years ago. I got lost. I remember being on a plane going from Kenya to South Africa, and I had no idea where I was. I didn't know where I was going, where I'd come from, and I panicked. I had a total anxiety attack. And then I suddenly realized that it absolutely didn't matter where I was going, or where I had come from because we are all essentially permanently displaced people. All of us are refugees. We come from somewhere and we are hopefully traveling all the time, moving towards a new place. Freedom means I may not be identified as any one group, but that I can visit and find myself in every group. It does not mean that I don't have values or beliefs, but it does mean I am not hardened around them. I do not use them as weapons. In the shared future, it will be just that, shared. The end goal will [be] becoming vulnerable, realizing the place of our connection to one another, rather than becoming secure, in control and alone. Thank you very much.(Applause)Chris Anderson: And how are you doing? Are you exhausted? On a typical day, do you wake up with hope or gloom? Eve Ensler: You know, I think Carl Jung once said that in order to survive the twentieth century, we have to live with two existing thoughts, opposite thoughts, at the same time. And I think part of what I'm learning in this process is that one must allow oneself to feel grief. And I think as long as I keep grieving, and weeping, and then moving on, I'm fine. When I start to pretend that what I'm seeing isn't impacting me, and isn't changing my heart, then I get in trouble. Because when you spend a lot of time going from place to place, country to country, and city to city, the degree to which women, for example, are violated, and the epidemic of it, and the kind of ordinariness of it, is so devastating to one's soul that you have to take the time, or I have to take the time now, to process that.CA: There are a lot of causes out there in the world that have been talked about, you know, poverty, sickness and so on. You spent eight years on this one. Why this one? EE: I think that if you think about women, women are the primary resource of the planet. They give birth, we come from them, they are mothers, they are visionaries, they are the future. If you think that the U.N. now says that one out of three women on the planet will be raped or beaten in their lifetime, we're talking about the desecration of the primary resource of the planet, we're talking about the place where we come from, we're talking about parenting. Imagine that you've been raped and you're bringing up a boy child. How does it impact your ability to work, or envision a future, or thrive, as opposed to just survive? What I believe is if we could figure out how to make women safe and honor women, it would be parallel or equal to honoring life itself.", "id": 217, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:11.958 --> 00:00:14.958\nI think it'll be a relief to some people and a disappointment to others\n\n00:00:14.958 --> 00:00:17.958\nthat I'm not going to talk about vaginas today.\n\n00:00:17.958 --> 00:00:22.958\nI began \"The Vagina Monologues\" because I was worried about vaginas.\n\n00:00:22.958 --> 00:00:26.958\nI'm very worried today about this notion, this world,\n\n00:00:26.958 --> 00:00:30.958\nthis prevailing kind of force of security.\n\n00:00:30.958 --> 00:00:34.958\nI see this word, hear this word, feel this word everywhere.\n\n00:00:34.958 --> 00:00:37.958\nReal security, security checks, security watch, security clearance.\n\n00:00:37.958 --> 00:00:43.958\nWhy has all this focus on security made me feel so much more insecure?\n\n00:00:43.958 --> 00:00:47.958\nWhat does anyone mean when they talk about real security?\n\n00:00:47.958 --> 00:00:49.958\nAnd why have we, as Americans particularly,\n\n00:00:49.958 --> 00:00:53.958\nbecome a nation that strives for security above all else?\n\n00:00:53.958 --> 00:00:57.958\nIn fact, I think that security is elusive.

You become your religion.\n\n00:02:01.958 --> 00:02:04.958\nYou become whatever it is that will freeze you, numb you\n\n00:02:04.958 --> 00:02:07.958\nand protect you from doubt or change.\n\n00:02:07.958 --> 00:02:11.958\nBut all this does, actually, is shut down your mind.\n\n00:02:11.958 --> 00:02:14.958\nIn reality, it does not really make you safer.\n\n00:02:14.958 --> 00:02:18.958\nI was in Sri Lanka, for example, three days after the tsunami,\n\n00:02:18.958 --> 00:02:20.958\nand I was standing on the beaches\n\n00:02:20.958 --> 00:02:23.958\nand it was absolutely clear that, in a matter of five minutes,\n\n00:02:23.958 --> 00:02:25.958\na 30-foot wave could rise up\n\n00:02:25.958 --> 00:02:28.958\nand desecrate a people, a population and lives.\n\n00:02:28.958 --> 00:02:31.958\nAll this striving for security, in fact,\n\n00:02:31.958 --> 00:02:33.958\nhas made you much more insecure\n\n00:02:33.958 --> 00:02:36.958\nbecause now you have to watch out all the time.\n\n00:02:36.958 --> 00:02:39.958\nThere are people not like you -- people who you now call enemies.\n\n00:02:39.958 --> 00:02:42.958\nYou have places you cannot go, thoughts you cannot think,\n\n00:02:42.958 --> 00:02:44.958\nworlds that you can no longer inhabit.\n\n00:02:44.958 --> 00:02:48.958\nAnd so you spend your days fighting things off, defending your territory\n\n00:02:48.958 --> 00:02:51.958\nand becoming more entrenched in your fundamental thinking.\n\n00:02:51.958 --> 00:02:54.958\nYour days become devoted to protecting yourself.\n\n00:02:54.958 --> 00:02:57.958\nThis becomes your mission. That is all you do.\n\n00:02:57.958 --> 00:03:00.958\nIdeas get shorter. They become sound bytes.\n\n00:03:00.958 --> 00:03:03.958\nThere are evildoers and saints, criminals and victims.\n\n00:03:03.958 --> 00:03:06.958\nThere are those who, if they're not with us, are against us.\n\n00:03:06.958 --> 00:03:09.958\nIt gets easier to hurt people because you do not feel what's inside them.\n\n00:03:09.958 --> 00:03:13.958\nIt gets easier to lock them up, force them to be naked, humiliate them,\n\n00:03:13.958 --> 00:03:15.958\noccupy them, invade them and kill them,\n\n00:03:15.958 --> 00:03:19.958\nbecause they are only obstacles now to your security.\n\n00:03:19.958 --> 00:03:23.958\nIn six years, I've had the extraordinary privilege through V-Day,\n\n00:03:23.958 --> 00:03:24.958\na global movement against [violence against] women,\n\n00:03:24.958 --> 00:03:26.958\nto travel probably to 60 countries,\n\n00:03:26.958 --> 00:03:31.958\nand spend a great deal of time in different portions.\n\n00:03:31.958 --> 00:03:34.958\nI've met women and men all over this planet,\n\n00:03:34.958 --> 00:03:36.958\nwho through various circumstances --\n\n00:03:36.958 --> 00:03:40.958\nwar, poverty, racism, multiple forms of violence --\n\n00:03:40.958 --> 00:03:42.958\nhave never known security,\n\n00:03:42.958 --> 00:03:46.958\nor have had their illusion of security forever devastated.\n\n00:03:46.958 --> 00:03:49.958\nI've spent time with women in Afghanistan under the Taliban,\n\n00:03:49.958 --> 00:03:52.958\nwho were essentially brutalized and censored.\n\n00:03:52.958 --> 00:03:54.958\nI've been in Bosnian refugee camps.\n\n00:03:54.958 --> 00:03:56.958\nI was with women in Pakistan\n\n00:03:56.958 --> 00:03:59.958\nwho have had their faces melted off with acid.\n\n00:03:59.958 --> 00:04:02.958\nI've been with girls all across America who were date-raped,\n\n00:04:02.958 --> 00:04:05.958\nor raped by their best friends when they were drugged one night.\n\n00:04:05.958 --> 00:04:09.958\nOne of the amazing things that I've discovered in my travels\n\n00:04:09.958 --> 00:04:11.958\nis that there is this emerging species.\n\n00:04:11.958 --> 00:04:15.958\nI loved when he was talking about this other world that's right next to this world.\n\n00:04:15.958 --> 00:04:18.958\nI've discovered these people, who, in V-Day world,\n\n00:04:18.958 --> 00:04:20.958\nwe call Vagina Warriors.\n\n00:04:20.958 --> 00:04:24.958\nThese particular people, rather than getting AK-47s,\n\n00:04:24.958 --> 00:04:27.958\nor weapons of mass destruction, or machetes,\n\n00:04:27.958 --> 00:04:32.958\nin the spirit of the warrior, have gone into the center, the heart of pain, of loss.\n\n00:04:32.958 --> 00:04:35.958\nThey have grieved it, they have died into it,\n\n00:04:35.958 --> 00:04:39.958\nand allowed and encouraged poison to turn into medicine.\n\n00:04:39.958 --> 00:04:43.958\nThey have used the fuel of their pain to begin to redirect that energy\n\n00:04:43.958 --> 00:04:46.958\ntowards another mission and another trajectory.\n\n00:04:46.958 --> 00:04:49.958\nThese warriors now devote themselves and their lives\n\n00:04:49.958 --> 00:04:53.958\nto making sure what happened to them doesn't happen to anyone else.\n\n00:04:53.958 --> 00:04:56.958\nThere are thousands if not millions of them on the planet.\n\n00:04:56.958 --> 00:04:58.958\nI venture there are many in this room.\n\n00:04:58.958 --> 00:05:00.958\nThey have a fierceness and a freedom\n\n00:05:00.958 --> 00:05:03.958\nthat I believe is the bedrock of a new paradigm.\n\n00:05:03.958 --> 00:05:08.958\nThey have broken out of the existing frame of victim and perpetrator.\n\n00:05:08.958 --> 00:05:11.958\nTheir own personal security is not their end goal,\n\n00:05:11.958 --> 00:05:15.958\nand because of that, because, rather than worrying about security,\n\n00:05:15.958 --> 00:05:18.958\nbecause the transformation of suffering is their end goal,\n\n00:05:18.958 --> 00:05:21.958\nI actually believe they are creating real safety\n\n00:05:21.958 --> 00:05:24.958\nand a whole new idea of security.\n\n00:05:24.958 --> 00:05:27.958\nI want to talk about a few of these people that I've met.\n\n00:05:27.958 --> 00:05:29.958\nTomorrow, I am going to Cairo,\n\n00:05:29.958 --> 00:05:33.958\nand I'm so moved that I will be with women in Cairo\n\n00:05:33.958 --> 00:05:36.958\nwho are V-Day women, who are opening the first safe house\n\n00:05:36.958 --> 00:05:38.958\nfor battered women in the Middle East.\n\n00:05:38.958 --> 00:05:42.958\nThat will happen because women in Cairo made a decision to stand up\n\n00:05:42.958 --> 00:05:44.958\nand put themselves on the line,\n\n00:05:44.958 --> 00:05:47.958\nand talk about the degree of violence that is happening in Egypt,\n\n00:05:47.958 --> 00:05:51.958\nand were willing to be attacked and criticized.\n\n00:05:51.958 --> 00:05:54.958\nAnd through their work over the last years,\n\n00:05:54.958 --> 00:05:56.958\nthis is not only happening that this house is opening,\n\n00:05:56.958 --> 00:05:59.958\nbut it's being supported by many factions of the society\n\n00:05:59.958 --> 00:06:01.958\nwho never would have supported it.\n\n00:06:01.958 --> 00:06:03.958\nWomen in Uganda this year,\n\n00:06:03.958 --> 00:06:06.958\nwho put on \"The Vagina Monologues\" during V-Day,\n\n00:06:06.958 --> 00:06:09.958\nactually evoked the wrath of the government.\n\n00:06:09.958 --> 00:06:11.958\nAnd, I love this story so much.\n\n00:06:11.958 --> 00:06:14.958\nThere was a cabinet meeting and a meeting of the presidents\n\n00:06:14.958 --> 00:06:17.958\nto talk about whether \"Vaginas\" could come to Uganda.\n\n00:06:17.958 --> 00:06:20.958\nAnd in this meeting -- it went on for weeks in the press,\n\n00:06:20.958 --> 00:06:22.958\ntwo weeks where there was huge discussion.\n\n00:06:22.958 --> 00:06:24.958\nThe government finally made a decision\n\n00:06:24.958 --> 00:06:27.958\nthat \"The Vagina Monologues\" could not be performed in Uganda.\n\n00:06:27.958 --> 00:06:31.958\nBut the amazing news was that because they had stood up, these women,\n\n00:06:31.958 --> 00:06:34.958\nand because they had been willing to risk their security,\n\n00:06:34.958 --> 00:06:37.958\nit began a discussion that not only happened in Uganda,\n\n00:06:37.958 --> 00:06:39.958\nbut all of Africa.\n\n00:06:39.958 --> 00:06:42.958\nAs a result, this production, which had already sold out,\n\n00:06:42.958 --> 00:06:47.958\nevery single person in that 800-seat audience, except for 10 people,\n\n00:06:47.958 --> 00:06:50.958\nmade a decision to keep the money.\n\n00:06:50.958 --> 00:06:55.958\nThey raised 10,000 dollars on a production that never occurred.\n\n00:06:55.958 --> 00:06:58.958\nThere's a young woman named Carrie Rethlefsen in Minnesota.\n\n00:06:58.958 --> 00:07:00.958\nShe's a high school student.\n\n00:07:00.958 --> 00:07:04.958\nShe had seen \"The Vagina Monologues\" and she was really moved. And as a result,\n\n00:07:04.958 --> 00:07:09.958\nshe wore an \"I heart my vagina\" button to her high school in Minnesota.\n\n00:07:09.958 --> 00:07:10.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:07:10.958 --> 00:07:15.958\nShe was basically threatened to be expelled from school.\n\n00:07:15.958 --> 00:07:18.958\nThey told her she couldn't love her vagina in high school,\n\n00:07:18.958 --> 00:07:21.958\nthat it was not a legal thing, that it was not a moral thing,\n\n00:07:21.958 --> 00:07:23.958\nthat it was not a good thing.\n\n00:07:23.958 --> 00:07:25.958\nSo she really struggled with this, what to do,\n\n00:07:25.958 --> 00:07:28.958\nbecause she was a senior and she was doing well in her school\n\n00:07:28.958 --> 00:07:32.958\nand she was threatened expulsion. So what she did is she got all her friends together --\n\n00:07:32.958 --> 00:07:35.958\nI believe it was 100, 150 students\n\n00:07:35.958 --> 00:07:38.958\nall wore \"I love my vagina\" T-shirts,\n\n00:07:38.958 --> 00:07:41.958\nand the boys wore \"I love her vagina\" T-shirts to school.\n\n00:07:41.958 --> 00:07:43.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:07:43.958 --> 00:07:46.958\nNow this seems like a fairly, you know, frivolous,\n\n00:07:46.958 --> 00:07:51.958\nbut what happened as a result of that, is that that school now\n\n00:07:51.958 --> 00:07:55.958\nis forming a sex education class. It's beginning to talk about sex,\n\n00:07:55.958 --> 00:07:58.958\nit's beginning to look at why it would be wrong\n\n00:07:58.958 --> 00:08:01.958\nfor a young high school girl to talk about her vagina publicly\n\n00:08:01.958 --> 00:08:04.958\nor to say that she loved her vagina publicly.\n\n00:08:04.958 --> 00:08:07.958\nI know I've talked about Agnes here before,\n\n00:08:07.958 --> 00:08:09.958\nbut I want to give you an update on Agnes.\n\n00:08:09.958 --> 00:08:11.958\nI met Agnes three years ago in the Rift Valley.\n\n00:08:11.958 --> 00:08:17.958\nWhen she was a young girl, she had been mutilated against her will.\n\n00:08:17.958 --> 00:08:19.958\nThat mutilation of her clitoris\n\n00:08:19.958 --> 00:08:21.958\nhad actually obviously impacted her life\n\n00:08:21.958 --> 00:08:24.958\nand changed it in a way that was devastating.\n\n00:08:24.958 --> 00:08:28.958\nShe made a decision not to go and get a razor or a glass shard,\n\n00:08:28.958 --> 00:08:32.958\nbut to devote her life to stopping that happening to other girls.\n\n00:08:32.958 --> 00:08:35.958\nFor eight years, she walked through the Rift Valley.\n\n00:08:35.958 --> 00:08:37.958\nShe had this amazing box that she carried and it had a\n\n00:08:37.958 --> 00:08:40.958\ntorso of a woman's body in it, a half a torso,\n\n00:08:40.958 --> 00:08:42.958\nand she would teach people, everywhere she went,\n\n00:08:42.958 --> 00:08:45.958\nwhat a healthy vagina looked like and what a mutilated vagina looked like.\n\n00:08:45.958 --> 00:08:49.958\nIn the years that she walked, she educated parents, mothers, fathers.\n\n00:08:49.958 --> 00:08:52.958\nShe saved 1,500 girls from being cut.\n\n00:08:52.958 --> 00:08:54.958\nWhen V-Day met her, we asked her how we could support her\n\n00:08:54.958 --> 00:08:56.958\nand she said, \"Well, if you got me a Jeep,\n\n00:08:56.958 --> 00:08:59.958\nI could get around a lot faster.\" So, we bought her a Jeep.\n\n00:08:59.958 --> 00:09:04.958\nIn the year she had the Jeep, she saved 4,500 girls from being cut.\n\n00:09:04.958 --> 00:09:05.958\nSo, we said, what else could we do?\n\n00:09:05.958 --> 00:09:08.958\nShe said, \"If you help me get money, I could open a house.\"\n\n00:09:08.958 --> 00:09:15.958\nThree years ago, Agnes opened a safe house in Africa to stop mutilation.\n\n00:09:15.958 --> 00:09:19.958\nWhen she began her mission eight years ago, she was reviled,\n\n00:09:19.958 --> 00:09:23.958\nshe was detested, she was completely slandered in her community.\n\n00:09:23.958 --> 00:09:26.958\nI am proud to tell you that six months ago,\n\n00:09:26.958 --> 00:09:29.958\nshe was elected the deputy mayor of Narok.\n\n00:09:29.958 --> 00:09:36.958\n(Applause)\n\n00:09:36.958 --> 00:09:38.958\nI think what I'm trying to say here\n\n00:09:38.958 --> 00:09:42.958\nis that if your end goal is security,\n\n00:09:42.958 --> 00:09:45.958\nand if that's all you're focusing on, what ends up happening\n\n00:09:45.958 --> 00:09:48.958\nis that you create not only more insecurity in other people,\n\n00:09:48.958 --> 00:09:51.958\nbut you make yourself far more insecure.\n\n00:09:51.958 --> 00:09:56.958\nReal security is contemplating death, not pretending it doesn't exist.\n\n00:09:56.958 --> 00:10:01.958\nNot running from loss, but entering grief, surrendering to sorrow.\n\n00:10:01.958 --> 00:10:05.958\nReal security is not knowing something, when you don't know it.\n\n00:10:05.958 --> 00:10:09.958\nReal security is hungering for connection rather than power.\n\n00:10:09.958 --> 00:10:12.958\nIt cannot be bought or arranged or made with bombs.\n\n00:10:12.958 --> 00:10:16.958\nIt is deeper, it is a process, it is acute awareness\n\n00:10:16.958 --> 00:10:18.958\nthat we are all utterly inter-bended,\n\n00:10:18.958 --> 00:10:21.958\nand one action by one being in one tiny town\n\n00:10:21.958 --> 00:10:24.958\nhas consequences everywhere.\n\n00:10:24.958 --> 00:10:26.958\nReal security is not only being able\n\n00:10:26.958 --> 00:10:30.958\nto tolerate mystery, complexity, ambiguity, but hungering for them\n\n00:10:30.958 --> 00:10:33.958\nand only trusting a situation when they are present.\n\n00:10:33.958 --> 00:10:39.958\nSomething happened when I began traveling in V-Day, eight years ago. I got lost.\n\n00:10:39.958 --> 00:10:44.958\nI remember being on a plane going from Kenya to South Africa,\n\n00:10:44.958 --> 00:10:45.958\nand I had no idea where I was.\n\n00:10:45.958 --> 00:10:48.958\nI didn't know where I was going, where I'd come from,\n\n00:10:48.958 --> 00:10:51.958\nand I panicked. I had a total anxiety attack.\n\n00:10:51.958 --> 00:10:54.958\nAnd then I suddenly realized that it absolutely didn't matter\n\n00:10:54.958 --> 00:10:56.958\nwhere I was going, or where I had come from\n\n00:10:56.958 --> 00:11:01.958\nbecause we are all essentially permanently displaced people.\n\n00:11:01.958 --> 00:11:03.958\nAll of us are refugees.\n\n00:11:03.958 --> 00:11:06.958\nWe come from somewhere and we are hopefully traveling all the time,\n\n00:11:06.958 --> 00:11:08.958\nmoving towards a new place.\n\n00:11:08.958 --> 00:11:12.958\nFreedom means I may not be identified as any one group,\n\n00:11:12.958 --> 00:11:16.958\nbut that I can visit and find myself in every group.\n\n00:11:16.958 --> 00:11:19.958\nIt does not mean that I don't have values or beliefs,\n\n00:11:19.958 --> 00:11:21.958\nbut it does mean I am not hardened around them.\n\n00:11:21.958 --> 00:11:24.958\nI do not use them as weapons.\n\n00:11:24.958 --> 00:11:29.958\nIn the shared future, it will be just that, shared.\n\n00:11:29.958 --> 00:11:31.958\nThe end goal will [be] becoming vulnerable,\n\n00:11:31.958 --> 00:11:34.958\nrealizing the place of our connection to one another,\n\n00:11:34.958 --> 00:11:39.958\nrather than becoming secure, in control and alone.\n\n00:11:39.958 --> 00:11:41.958\nThank you very much.\n\n00:11:41.958 --> 00:11:44.958\n(Applause)\n\n00:11:44.958 --> 00:11:49.958\nChris Anderson: And how are you doing? Are you exhausted?\n\n00:11:49.958 --> 00:11:53.958\nOn a typical day, do you wake up with hope or gloom?\n\n00:11:53.958 --> 00:11:55.958\nEve Ensler: You know, I think Carl Jung once said\n\n00:11:55.958 --> 00:11:58.958\nthat in order to survive the twentieth century,\n\n00:11:58.958 --> 00:12:02.958\nwe have to live with two existing thoughts, opposite thoughts, at the same time.\n\n00:12:02.958 --> 00:12:06.958\nAnd I think part of what I'm learning in this process\n\n00:12:06.958 --> 00:12:10.958\nis that one must allow oneself to feel grief.\n\n00:12:10.958 --> 00:12:13.958\nAnd I think as long as I keep grieving, and weeping,\n\n00:12:13.958 --> 00:12:15.958\nand then moving on, I'm fine.\n\n00:12:15.958 --> 00:12:19.958\nWhen I start to pretend that what I'm seeing isn't impacting me,\n\n00:12:19.958 --> 00:12:23.958\nand isn't changing my heart, then I get in trouble.\n\n00:12:23.958 --> 00:12:27.958\nBecause when you spend a lot of time going from place to place,\n\n00:12:27.958 --> 00:12:29.958\ncountry to country, and city to city,\n\n00:12:29.958 --> 00:12:32.958\nthe degree to which women, for example, are violated,\n\n00:12:32.958 --> 00:12:36.958\nand the epidemic of it, and the kind of ordinariness of it,\n\n00:12:36.958 --> 00:12:41.958\nis so devastating to one's soul that you have to take the time,\n\n00:12:41.958 --> 00:12:44.958\nor I have to take the time now, to process that.\n\n00:12:44.958 --> 00:12:48.958\nCA: There are a lot of causes out there in the world that have been talked about,\n\n00:12:48.958 --> 00:12:53.958\nyou know, poverty, sickness and so on. You spent eight years on this one.\n\n00:12:53.958 --> 00:12:55.958\nWhy this one?\n\n00:12:55.958 --> 00:12:57.958\nEE: I think that if you think about women,\n\n00:12:57.958 --> 00:13:02.958\nwomen are the primary resource of the planet. They give birth,\n\n00:13:02.958 --> 00:13:05.958\nwe come from them, they are mothers, they are visionaries,\n\n00:13:05.958 --> 00:13:08.958\nthey are the future. If you think that the U.N. now says\n\n00:13:08.958 --> 00:13:10.958\nthat one out of three women on the planet\n\n00:13:10.958 --> 00:13:13.958\nwill be raped or beaten in their lifetime,\n\n00:13:13.958 --> 00:13:17.958\nwe're talking about the desecration of the primary resource of the planet,\n\n00:13:17.958 --> 00:13:20.958\nwe're talking about the place where we come from, we're talking about parenting.\n\n00:13:20.958 --> 00:13:22.958\nImagine that you've been raped and you're bringing up a boy child.\n\n00:13:22.958 --> 00:13:26.958\nHow does it impact your ability to work, or envision a future,\n\n00:13:26.958 --> 00:13:30.958\nor thrive, as opposed to just survive? What I believe is\n\n00:13:30.958 --> 00:13:34.958\nif we could figure out how to make women safe and honor women,\n\n00:13:34.958 --> 00:13:39.958\nit would be parallel or equal to honoring life itself."}, {"title": "How to pitch to a VC", "duration": "879", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/david_s_rose_on_pitching_to_vcs", "transcript": "Good morning. My name is David Rose. I am a serial entrepreneur turned serial investor. And by the use of pitching PowerPoints to VCs, I have personally raised tens of millions of dollars from VCs through PowerPoint pitches. And turning to the other side of the equation, I've personally supervised the investment of tens of millions of dollars into companies who have pitched me with PowerPoint presentations. So I think it's safe to say I know a little bit about the process of pitching.So, the very first question you've got to figure out is: What is the single most important thing that a VC is looking for when you come to them pitching your new business idea? There are obviously all kinds of things \u2014 business models and financials and markets and this and that. Overall, of all the things that you have to do, what is the single most important thing the VC is going to be investing in? Somebody? What?Audience: People!David Rose: People! You! That's it \u2014 you are the person. Therefore, the entire purpose of a VC pitch is to convince them that you are the entrepreneur in whom they are going to invest their money and make a lot of money in return.Now, how do you do this? You can't just walk up and say, \"Hi, I'm a really good guy, good girl, and you should invest in me.\" Right? So in the course of your VC pitch \u2014 you have a very few minutes; most VC pitches, angel pitches, are about 15 minutes, most should be less than half an hour \u2014 people's attention span, after 18 minutes, begins to drop off. Tests have shown. So in that 18 or 10 or five minutes, you have to convey a whole bunch of different characteristics, about 10 different characteristics, while you're standing up there. What's the single most important thing you've got to convey? What?Audience: Integrity.DR: Boy, oh boy, oh boy! That's a straight line, look at that! And I didn't even prompt him. Right, integrity. The key thing. I would much rather invest in, take a chance on, somebody who I know is straight than where there's any possible question of who are they looking out for, and what's going on. So the most important thing is integrity. What's the second most important thing? Let's see if you can get this one.Audience: Self-confidence.DR: Close enough. Passion. Right? Entrepreneurs, by definition, are people who are leaving something else, starting a new world, creating and putting their lifeblood into this thing. You've got to convey passion. If you're not passionate, why should anyone else be, or put money into your company if you're not passionate about it? Integrity, passion: the most important things.Then there's a whole panoply of other things you've got to wrap up in this package you're presenting to a VC. Experience: you've got to be able to say, \"Hey, you know, I've done this before.\" \"Done this before\" is starting an enterprise, creating value, and taking something from beginning to end. That's why VCs love to fund serial entrepreneurs \u2014 even if you didn't do it right the first time, you've learned the lessons, which puts you in good stead the next time.Along with the experience of starting an enterprise or running something \u2014 doesn't have to be a business, it can be an organization in a school, a not-for-profit. But experience in creating an organization.Next: knowledge. If you tell me you're going to be the developer of the map of the human genome, you better know what a human genome is; I want you to have expertise. I don't want somebody who says, \"I've got a great idea in a business I know nothing about. I don't know who the players are, what the market is like.\" You've got to know your market, your area.And you have to have the skills that it takes to get a company going. Those skills include everything from technical skills if it's a technology business, to marketing and sales and management and so on. But, you know, not everybody has all these skills. Very few people have the full set of skills it takes to run a company.What else do you require? Well, leadership. You've got to be able to convince us that you either have developed a team that has all those factors in it, or else you can. And you have the charisma and the management style and the ability to get people to follow your lead, to inspire them, to motivate them to be part of your team.Having done all that, what else do I want to know as a VC? I want to know that you have commitment. That you are going to be here to the end. I want you to say \u2014 or I want you to convey \u2014 that you are going to die if you have to, with your very last breath, your fingernails scratching as they draw you out. You'll keep my money alive and make more from it. I don't want someone who'll cut and run at the first opportunity. Bad things happen. There's never been a venture-funded company where bad things didn't happen. So know that you're committed to the very end.You've got to have vision to see where this is going. I don't want another \"me too\" product. I want somebody who can change the world out there. But on top of that, I need realism, Because while changing the world is great, it doesn't always happen. And before you get to change the world, bad things are going to take place; you have to deal with that. And you have to have rational projections.Finally, you're asking for my money \u2014 not just because it's my money, but because it's me. You need to be coachable. I need to know you have the ability to listen. We've had a lot of experience. People who are VCs or angels investing in you have had experience, and they'd like to know that you want to hear that experience.So how do you convey these 10 things in 10 minutes without saying them? You can't say, \"I've got integrity, invest in me!\" You've got to do a whole pitch that conveys this without conveying it. Think about your pitch as a timeline. It starts off, you walk in the door. They know nothing whatsoever about you. You can take them on an emotional \u2014 all pitches, all sales presentations, are emotional at some level. You can go up, you can go down, right? And it goes from beginning to end.You walk in, the first thing you've got to do, the overall arc of your presentation, it's got to start like a rocket. You've got maybe 10 seconds \u2014 between 10 and 30 seconds, depending on how long the pitch is \u2014 to get their attention. In my case, I've invested. I've gotten millions of dollars from PowerPoint pitches. \"I've invested millions.\" That should get you right there. This can be a fact or something counterintuitive. It can be a story or an experience. But you've got to grab their emotional attention, focused on you, within that first few seconds. And then from there, you've got to take them on a very solid, steady, upward path, right from beginning to end. Everything has to reinforce this.And you've got to get better and better and better, revving up to the very end, then you've got to \u2014 boom! \u2014 knock them out of the park. You want to get them to such an emotional high they're ready to write you a check, throw money at you, before you leave.How do you do that? First of all, logical progression. Any time you go backwards, any time you skip a step \u2014 imagine walking up a staircase where some of the treads are missing, or the heights are different. You stop, you need to figure out a nice, logical progression. Start with what the market is: Why are you going to do X, Y or Z? And then you've got to tell me how you're going to do it, and what you're going to do. And it's got to flow from beginning to end.You've got to let me know there are touchstones, to tie in to the rest of the world out there. For example, reference companies I've heard of, or basic items in your business. I want to know about things that I can relate to: validators, or anything that tells me somebody else has approved this, or there's outside validation. It can be sales; it can be you got an award for something; it can be people have done it before; it can be your beta tests are going great, whatever. I want to know validation \u2014 not just what you're telling me, but that somebody or something else out there says this makes sense. And then, I'm looking for the upside; I need a believable upside. That's two parts; it's got to be upside and believable. The upside means if you tell me that five years out, you're making a million dollars a year, that's not really upside. Telling me you'll be making a billion dollars a year \u2014 that's not believable. So it's got to be both.On the other hand are things that take the emotional level down. You have to recover from those. For example, anything that I know is not true. \"We have no competition. Nobody makes a widget like this.\" Odds are I know somebody who's made a widget, and the minute you tell me that, I discount half of what you're saying from then on. Anything I don't understand, where I have to make the leap myself, in my own head, will stop the flow of the presentation. So you've got to take me through like a sixth-grader \u2014 dub, dub, dub \u2014 but without patronizing me. And it's a very tricky path. But if you can do it, it works really well.Anything that's inconsistent within your concept \u2014 if you tell me sales of X, Y or Z are 10 million dollars, five slides later, they're five million dollars ... One may have been gross sales, one may have been net sales, but I want to know that all the numbers make sense together.And then, finally: anything that's an error or a typo, or a stupid mistake or a line that's in the wrong place \u2014 that shows me that if you can't do a presentation, how can you run a company? So this all feeds in together.The best way to do this is to look at our betters, people who have done this before. Let's look at the most successful technology executive in the business, and see how a presentation goes. Bill Gates's PowerPoint presentation over here. Here's Gates doing a thing for Windows. Is this how to do a PowerPoint presentation? What do you think? No. Who do you think we should look at as our role model?Oh, isn't that funny! There's another great one over here. OK, Steve Jobs. You want absolute \u2014 this is the Zen of presentation, right? Here he is, one little guy, black jeans and stuff, on a totally empty stage. What are you focusing on? You're focusing on him! This is Steve Jobs.So are these wonderful long bullet points, whole list of things good? No, they're not. The long bullet points are bad. What's good? Short. Short bullet points. But you know what? Even better than short bullet points are no bullet points. Just give me the headline. And you know what? How many bullet points does Steve Jobs use? Basically, none. What do you do? Best of all, images. Just a simple image. I look at the image; a picture's worth a thousand words. You look at the image and you've got the whole thing. Then you come back to me; you're focused on me, why I'm such a great guy, why you want to invest, why this all makes sense.That said, we only have a very short time, so let's run through the things to include in your presentation. First of all, none of these big, long-titled slides with blah, blah, I'm presenting to so-and-so on X date. I know the day, I know who I am \u2014 I don't need all that. Just give me your company logo. I look at the logo, and it ties it to my brain. Then I come back to you. I'm focused on you, OK? You give me your quick, 15-second or 30-second intro, grab my attention. Then you give me a quick business overview. This is not a five-minute pitch. This is, you know, two sentences. \"We build widgets for the X, Y, Z market.\" Or, \"We sell services to help do X.\" You know, whatever. And that is like the picture on the outside of a jigsaw puzzle box. That lets me know the context. It gives me the armature for the whole thing you'll be going through; it lets me put everything in relation to what you've told me.Then you've got to walk me through, show me who your management team is. I want to know the size of the market. Why is this market worth getting at? I want to know your product, that's very important. Now, this is not a product pitch or sales pitch. I don't want to know all the ins and outs, just what the heck is it? If it's a website, show me a screenshot of your website. Don't do a live demo. Never do a live demo. Do a canned demo, or something that lets me know why people are going to buy whatever it is.Now that I know what you're selling, tell me how you make money on it. For every X you sell, you get Y, or services of Z. I want to know what the business model is on a per-unit basis, or for the actual product you're selling. I want to know who you're selling to in terms of customers and if you have any special relationships that will help you, whether it's a distribution relationship or a producing partner. Again, validation. This helps to say you're bigger than just one little thing over here.But everybody has competition. There's never been a company with no competition, even if the competition is the old way of doing something. I want to know exactly what your competition is, and that will help me judge how you fit into the whole operation. I want to know how you're special.I know what your competition does \u2014 how are you going to prevent them from eating your lunch? All this ties into the financial overview. And you can't do a VC pitch without giving me your financials. I want to know a year or two back, or as long as you've been in existence. And I want to know four or five years forward. Five is a bit much. Probably four.And I want to know how that business model, on a product basis, will translate into a company model: How many widgets will you sell? You make X amount per widget. I want to know what the driver is. We'll have 1,000 customers this year and 10,000 the next, our revenues will do this and that. That gives me the whole picture for the next several years into which I'm investing. And I want to know how the money from me will help you get there. You're going to open an offshore plant in China, you're going to spend it all on sales and marketing, you're going to go to Tahiti, whatever.But then comes the ask, where you tell me how much you want. You're looking for 5 million \u2014 at what valuation? Two million? 100,000? What's the money in so far? Who invested? I hope you invested \u2014 if you can't invest in your own thing, why should I? So I like to know if you have friends and family, or angel investors, or more VCs before. What's the capital structure up until this point? Finally, having done all that, you've now told me the whole thing, so now you bring it back to that conclusion. This is that rocket going up. Hopefully everything has been positive. And everything you say clicks, it all makes sense. And I'm thinking, \"This is really great!\"Then you take me back to just your logo on the screen. And I look at the logo \u2014 OK, good. Now I come back to you. Nothing else to look at, right? Now you've got to wrap it up to give me the final \u2014 boom! \u2014 the final pitch that's going to send me into space. Now, in the process of doing this, how do you remember the sequences and do it? You've noticed I'm not looking at the screen, right? The screen is in front of me, so I couldn't even see if I wanted to.So how do I know what's going on? Well, I have a laptop in front of me. You're looking at me and at this. What am I looking at? You think that I'm looking at that? No, I'm looking, actually, at a special version of PowerPoint over here, which shows me the slides ahead and behind, my notes, so I can see what's going on. PowerPoint has this built into every copy of it that's shipped. If you use Apple's Keynote, it's got an even better version. There's another program called Ovation you can get from Adobe that they bought last summer, which helps you run the timers and lets you figure out what's going on.So, here's my wrap-up to take you to the moon, right? I usually do a Top 10, but we don't have time, so: David's Top Five Presentation Tips. Number five: always use presenter mode, or Ovation, or presenter tools. It lets you know exactly where you're going, helps you pace yourself, gives you a timer, the whole bit.Number four: always use remote control. Have you seen me touch the computer? No. Why not? Because I'm using remote control. Always use remote control.Number three: the handouts you give are not your presentation. If you follow my suggestions, you'll have a very spare, Zen-like presentation, which is great to convey who you are and get people emotionally involved, but not good as a handout. You want a handout that gives more information; it has to stand without you.Number two: don't read your speech. Can you imagine?(Reading) \"You should invest in my company ... \"It doesn't work. And the number one presentation tip: never, ever look at the screen. You're making a connection with your audience, and you always want a one-on-one connection. The screen should come up behind you and supplement what you're doing, instead of replace you. And that is how to pitch to a VC.", "id": 353, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:12.283 --> 00:00:13.443\nGood morning.\n\n00:00:13.467 --> 00:00:14.727\nMy name is David Rose.\n\n00:00:14.751 --> 00:00:18.307\nI am a serial entrepreneur\nturned serial investor.\n\n00:00:18.331 --> 00:00:21.927\nAnd by the use of pitching\nPowerPoints to VCs,\n\n00:00:21.951 --> 00:00:24.427\nI have personally raised\ntens of millions of dollars\n\n00:00:24.451 --> 00:00:27.321\nfrom VCs through PowerPoint pitches.\n\n00:00:27.345 --> 00:00:29.523\nAnd turning to the other side\nof the equation,\n\n00:00:29.547 --> 00:00:32.963\nI've personally supervised the investment\nof tens of millions of dollars\n\n00:00:32.987 --> 00:00:36.054\ninto companies who have pitched me\nwith PowerPoint presentations.\n\n00:00:36.078 --> 00:00:37.403\nSo I think it's safe to say\n\n00:00:37.427 --> 00:00:40.079\nI know a little bit\nabout the process of pitching.\n\n00:00:40.103 --> 00:00:42.735\nSo, the very first question\nyou've got to figure out is:\n\n00:00:42.759 --> 00:00:46.417\nWhat is the single most important\nthing that a VC is looking for\n\n00:00:46.441 --> 00:00:49.559\nwhen you come to them\npitching your new business idea?\n\n00:00:49.583 --> 00:00:51.588\nThere are obviously all kinds of things --\n\n00:00:51.612 --> 00:00:54.494\nbusiness models and financials\nand markets and this and that.\n\n00:00:54.518 --> 00:00:56.724\nOverall, of all the things\nthat you have to do,\n\n00:00:56.748 --> 00:00:58.655\nwhat is the single most important thing\n\n00:00:58.679 --> 00:01:00.655\nthe VC is going to be investing in?\n\n00:01:01.701 --> 00:01:02.934\nSomebody? What?\n\n00:01:02.958 --> 00:01:04.112\nAudience: People!\n\n00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:07.839\nDavid Rose: People! You!\nThat's it -- you are the person.\n\n00:01:07.863 --> 00:01:11.739\nTherefore, the entire purpose\nof a VC pitch is to convince them\n\n00:01:11.763 --> 00:01:15.357\nthat you are the entrepreneur in whom\nthey are going to invest their money\n\n00:01:15.381 --> 00:01:17.271\nand make a lot of money in return.\n\n00:01:17.295 --> 00:01:18.462\nNow, how do you do this?\n\n00:01:18.486 --> 00:01:19.986\nYou can't just walk up and say,\n\n00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:23.954\n\"Hi, I'm a really good guy, good girl,\nand you should invest in me.\" Right?\n\n00:01:23.978 --> 00:01:27.552\nSo in the course of your VC pitch --\nyou have a very few minutes;\n\n00:01:27.576 --> 00:01:30.689\nmost VC pitches, angel pitches,\nare about 15 minutes,\n\n00:01:30.713 --> 00:01:33.133\nmost should be less than half an hour --\n\n00:01:33.157 --> 00:01:36.075\npeople's attention span,\nafter 18 minutes, begins to drop off.\n\n00:01:36.099 --> 00:01:37.250\nTests have shown.\n\n00:01:37.274 --> 00:01:39.469\nSo in that 18 or 10 or five minutes,\n\n00:01:39.493 --> 00:01:42.429\nyou have to convey a whole bunch\nof different characteristics,\n\n00:01:42.453 --> 00:01:44.515\nabout 10 different characteristics,\n\n00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:46.032\nwhile you're standing up there.\n\n00:01:46.056 --> 00:01:49.670\nWhat's the single most important thing\nyou've got to convey? What?\n\n00:01:49.694 --> 00:01:50.888\nAudience: Integrity.\n\n00:01:50.912 --> 00:01:52.111\nDR: Boy, oh boy, oh boy!\n\n00:01:52.135 --> 00:01:53.921\nThat's a straight line, look at that!\n\n00:01:53.945 --> 00:01:55.342\nAnd I didn't even prompt him.\n\n00:01:55.366 --> 00:01:57.294\nRight, integrity. The key thing.\n\n00:01:57.318 --> 00:02:00.326\nI would much rather invest in,\ntake a chance on,\n\n00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:03.977\nsomebody who I know is straight\nthan where there's any possible question\n\n00:02:04.001 --> 00:02:06.499\nof who are they looking out for,\nand what's going on.\n\n00:02:06.523 --> 00:02:08.507\nSo the most important thing is integrity.\n\n00:02:08.531 --> 00:02:10.625\nWhat's the second most important thing?\n\n00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:12.275\nLet's see if you can get this one.\n\n00:02:12.299 --> 00:02:13.605\nAudience: Self-confidence.\n\n00:02:13.629 --> 00:02:14.934\nDR: Close enough. Passion.\n\n00:02:15.676 --> 00:02:19.489\nRight? Entrepreneurs, by definition,\nare people who are leaving something else,\n\n00:02:19.513 --> 00:02:23.195\nstarting a new world, creating and putting\ntheir lifeblood into this thing.\n\n00:02:23.219 --> 00:02:24.604\nYou've got to convey passion.\n\n00:02:24.628 --> 00:02:25.931\nIf you're not passionate,\n\n00:02:25.955 --> 00:02:29.107\nwhy should anyone else be,\nor put money into your company\n\n00:02:29.131 --> 00:02:30.822\nif you're not passionate about it?\n\n00:02:30.846 --> 00:02:33.154\nIntegrity, passion:\nthe most important things.\n\n00:02:33.178 --> 00:02:36.359\nThen there's a whole panoply\nof other things you've got to wrap up\n\n00:02:36.383 --> 00:02:38.573\nin this package you're presenting to a VC.\n\n00:02:38.597 --> 00:02:40.651\nExperience: you've got to be able to say,\n\n00:02:40.675 --> 00:02:42.833\n\"Hey, you know, I've done this before.\"\n\n00:02:42.857 --> 00:02:45.893\n\"Done this before\" is starting\nan enterprise, creating value,\n\n00:02:45.917 --> 00:02:47.926\nand taking something\nfrom beginning to end.\n\n00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:50.465\nThat's why VCs love to fund\nserial entrepreneurs --\n\n00:02:50.489 --> 00:02:52.641\neven if you didn't do it right\nthe first time,\n\n00:02:52.665 --> 00:02:56.004\nyou've learned the lessons, which puts\nyou in good stead the next time.\n\n00:02:56.028 --> 00:02:59.581\nAlong with the experience of starting\nan enterprise or running something --\n\n00:02:59.605 --> 00:03:01.051\ndoesn't have to be a business,\n\n00:03:01.075 --> 00:03:03.781\nit can be an organization\nin a school, a not-for-profit.\n\n00:03:03.805 --> 00:03:05.859\nBut experience\nin creating an organization.\n\n00:03:05.883 --> 00:03:07.034\nNext: knowledge.\n\n00:03:07.058 --> 00:03:08.209\nIf you tell me\n\n00:03:08.233 --> 00:03:11.264\nyou're going to be the developer\nof the map of the human genome,\n\n00:03:11.288 --> 00:03:14.678\nyou better know what a human genome is;\nI want you to have expertise.\n\n00:03:14.702 --> 00:03:16.187\nI don't want somebody who says,\n\n00:03:16.211 --> 00:03:18.934\n\"I've got a great idea\nin a business I know nothing about.\n\n00:03:18.958 --> 00:03:21.737\nI don't know who the players are,\nwhat the market is like.\"\n\n00:03:21.761 --> 00:03:23.777\nYou've got to know your market, your area.\n\n00:03:23.801 --> 00:03:25.904\nAnd you have to have\nthe skills that it takes\n\n00:03:25.928 --> 00:03:27.078\nto get a company going.\n\n00:03:27.102 --> 00:03:30.175\nThose skills include\neverything from technical skills\n\n00:03:30.199 --> 00:03:31.921\nif it's a technology business,\n\n00:03:31.945 --> 00:03:34.719\nto marketing and sales\nand management and so on.\n\n00:03:34.743 --> 00:03:37.425\nBut, you know, not everybody\nhas all these skills.\n\n00:03:37.449 --> 00:03:41.144\nVery few people have the full set\nof skills it takes to run a company.\n\n00:03:41.168 --> 00:03:43.195\nWhat else do you require?\nWell, leadership.\n\n00:03:43.219 --> 00:03:46.725\nYou've got to be able to convince us\nthat you either have developed a team\n\n00:03:46.749 --> 00:03:49.573\nthat has all those factors\nin it, or else you can.\n\n00:03:49.597 --> 00:03:52.028\nAnd you have the charisma\nand the management style\n\n00:03:52.052 --> 00:03:54.831\nand the ability to get people\nto follow your lead,\n\n00:03:54.855 --> 00:03:58.143\nto inspire them, to motivate them\nto be part of your team.\n\n00:03:58.167 --> 00:03:59.715\nHaving done all that,\n\n00:03:59.739 --> 00:04:01.460\nwhat else do I want to know as a VC?\n\n00:04:01.484 --> 00:04:03.579\nI want to know that you have commitment.\n\n00:04:03.603 --> 00:04:05.564\nThat you are going to be here to the end.\n\n00:04:05.588 --> 00:04:08.210\nI want you to say --\nor I want you to convey --\n\n00:04:08.234 --> 00:04:11.858\nthat you are going to die if you\nhave to, with your very last breath,\n\n00:04:11.882 --> 00:04:14.208\nyour fingernails scratching\nas they draw you out.\n\n00:04:14.232 --> 00:04:16.708\nYou'll keep my money alive\nand make more from it.\n\n00:04:16.732 --> 00:04:19.790\nI don't want someone who'll\ncut and run at the first opportunity.\n\n00:04:19.814 --> 00:04:20.965\nBad things happen.\n\n00:04:20.989 --> 00:04:24.530\nThere's never been a venture-funded\ncompany where bad things didn't happen.\n\n00:04:24.554 --> 00:04:26.699\nSo know that you're committed\nto the very end.\n\n00:04:26.723 --> 00:04:29.319\nYou've got to have vision\nto see where this is going.\n\n00:04:29.343 --> 00:04:31.156\nI don't want another \"me too\" product.\n\n00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:33.606\nI want somebody who can\nchange the world out there.\n\n00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:35.302\nBut on top of that, I need realism,\n\n00:04:35.326 --> 00:04:39.483\nBecause while changing the world\nis great, it doesn't always happen.\n\n00:04:39.507 --> 00:04:41.436\nAnd before you get to change the world,\n\n00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:43.131\nbad things are going to take place;\n\n00:04:43.155 --> 00:04:44.483\nyou have to deal with that.\n\n00:04:44.507 --> 00:04:46.512\nAnd you have to have rational projections.\n\n00:04:46.536 --> 00:04:48.455\nFinally, you're asking for my money --\n\n00:04:48.479 --> 00:04:50.913\nnot just because it's my money,\nbut because it's me.\n\n00:04:50.937 --> 00:04:52.133\nYou need to be coachable.\n\n00:04:52.157 --> 00:04:54.308\nI need to know\nyou have the ability to listen.\n\n00:04:54.332 --> 00:04:55.772\nWe've had a lot of experience.\n\n00:04:55.796 --> 00:04:59.075\nPeople who are VCs or angels\ninvesting in you have had experience,\n\n00:04:59.099 --> 00:05:02.099\nand they'd like to know that you\nwant to hear that experience.\n\n00:05:02.123 --> 00:05:05.479\nSo how do you convey these 10 things\nin 10 minutes without saying them?\n\n00:05:05.503 --> 00:05:07.878\nYou can't say, \"I've got\nintegrity, invest in me!\"\n\n00:05:07.902 --> 00:05:11.224\nYou've got to do a whole pitch\nthat conveys this without conveying it.\n\n00:05:11.248 --> 00:05:13.015\nThink about your pitch as a timeline.\n\n00:05:13.039 --> 00:05:14.921\nIt starts off, you walk in the door.\n\n00:05:14.945 --> 00:05:16.824\nThey know nothing whatsoever about you.\n\n00:05:16.848 --> 00:05:20.479\nYou can take them on an emotional --\nall pitches, all sales presentations,\n\n00:05:20.503 --> 00:05:21.869\nare emotional at some level.\n\n00:05:21.893 --> 00:05:23.789\nYou can go up, you can go down, right?\n\n00:05:23.813 --> 00:05:25.437\nAnd it goes from beginning to end.\n\n00:05:25.461 --> 00:05:27.611\nYou walk in, the first thing\nyou've got to do,\n\n00:05:27.635 --> 00:05:31.005\nthe overall arc of your presentation,\nit's got to start like a rocket.\n\n00:05:31.029 --> 00:05:32.764\nYou've got maybe 10 seconds --\n\n00:05:32.788 --> 00:05:35.948\nbetween 10 and 30 seconds,\ndepending on how long the pitch is --\n\n00:05:35.972 --> 00:05:37.496\nto get their attention.\n\n00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:38.966\nIn my case, I've invested.\n\n00:05:38.990 --> 00:05:41.784\nI've gotten millions of dollars\nfrom PowerPoint pitches.\n\n00:05:41.808 --> 00:05:44.667\n\"I've invested millions.\"\nThat should get you right there.\n\n00:05:44.691 --> 00:05:47.005\nThis can be a fact\nor something counterintuitive.\n\n00:05:47.029 --> 00:05:48.728\nIt can be a story or an experience.\n\n00:05:48.752 --> 00:05:51.836\nBut you've got to grab\ntheir emotional attention, focused on you,\n\n00:05:51.860 --> 00:05:53.336\nwithin that first few seconds.\n\n00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:55.428\nAnd then from there,\nyou've got to take them\n\n00:05:55.452 --> 00:05:59.316\non a very solid, steady, upward path,\nright from beginning to end.\n\n00:05:59.340 --> 00:06:00.933\nEverything has to reinforce this.\n\n00:06:00.957 --> 00:06:03.358\nAnd you've got to get better\nand better and better,\n\n00:06:03.382 --> 00:06:04.754\nrevving up to the very end,\n\n00:06:04.778 --> 00:06:06.285\nthen you've got to -- boom! --\n\n00:06:06.309 --> 00:06:07.611\nknock them out of the park.\n\n00:06:07.635 --> 00:06:09.794\nYou want to get them\nto such an emotional high\n\n00:06:09.818 --> 00:06:12.398\nthey're ready to write you a check,\nthrow money at you,\n\n00:06:12.422 --> 00:06:13.573\nbefore you leave.\n\n00:06:13.597 --> 00:06:14.748\nHow do you do that?\n\n00:06:14.772 --> 00:06:16.586\nFirst of all, logical progression.\n\n00:06:16.610 --> 00:06:19.969\nAny time you go backwards,\nany time you skip a step --\n\n00:06:19.993 --> 00:06:23.195\nimagine walking up a staircase\nwhere some of the treads are missing,\n\n00:06:23.219 --> 00:06:24.935\nor the heights are different.\n\n00:06:24.959 --> 00:06:27.852\nYou stop, you need to figure out\na nice, logical progression.\n\n00:06:27.876 --> 00:06:31.100\nStart with what the market is:\nWhy are you going to do X, Y or Z?\n\n00:06:31.124 --> 00:06:33.815\nAnd then you've got to tell me\nhow you're going to do it,\n\n00:06:33.839 --> 00:06:35.364\nand what you're going to do.\n\n00:06:35.388 --> 00:06:37.553\nAnd it's got to flow\nfrom beginning to end.\n\n00:06:37.577 --> 00:06:39.863\nYou've got to let me know\nthere are touchstones,\n\n00:06:39.887 --> 00:06:42.037\nto tie in to the rest\nof the world out there.\n\n00:06:42.061 --> 00:06:45.359\nFor example, reference\ncompanies I've heard of,\n\n00:06:45.383 --> 00:06:47.915\nor basic items in your business.\n\n00:06:47.939 --> 00:06:50.692\nI want to know about things\nthat I can relate to:\n\n00:06:50.716 --> 00:06:54.413\nvalidators, or anything that tells me\nsomebody else has approved this,\n\n00:06:54.437 --> 00:06:56.140\nor there's outside validation.\n\n00:06:56.164 --> 00:06:59.188\nIt can be sales; it can be\nyou got an award for something;\n\n00:06:59.212 --> 00:07:01.910\nit can be people have done it before;\n\n00:07:01.934 --> 00:07:04.914\nit can be your beta tests\nare going great, whatever.\n\n00:07:04.938 --> 00:07:07.835\nI want to know validation --\nnot just what you're telling me,\n\n00:07:07.859 --> 00:07:09.958\nbut that somebody\nor something else out there\n\n00:07:09.982 --> 00:07:11.216\nsays this makes sense.\n\n00:07:11.240 --> 00:07:14.307\nAnd then, I'm looking for the upside;\nI need a believable upside.\n\n00:07:14.331 --> 00:07:16.957\nThat's two parts; it's got\nto be upside and believable.\n\n00:07:16.981 --> 00:07:19.461\nThe upside means if you tell me\nthat five years out,\n\n00:07:19.485 --> 00:07:22.544\nyou're making a million dollars a year,\nthat's not really upside.\n\n00:07:22.568 --> 00:07:25.149\nTelling me you'll be making\na billion dollars a year --\n\n00:07:25.173 --> 00:07:26.324\nthat's not believable.\n\n00:07:26.348 --> 00:07:27.499\nSo it's got to be both.\n\n00:07:27.523 --> 00:07:30.544\nOn the other hand are things\nthat take the emotional level down.\n\n00:07:30.568 --> 00:07:32.047\nYou have to recover from those.\n\n00:07:32.071 --> 00:07:34.218\nFor example, anything\nthat I know is not true.\n\n00:07:34.242 --> 00:07:36.966\n\"We have no competition.\nNobody makes a widget like this.\"\n\n00:07:36.990 --> 00:07:39.094\nOdds are I know somebody\nwho's made a widget,\n\n00:07:39.118 --> 00:07:40.726\nand the minute you tell me that,\n\n00:07:40.750 --> 00:07:43.378\nI discount half of what\nyou're saying from then on.\n\n00:07:43.402 --> 00:07:46.147\nAnything I don't understand,\n\n00:07:46.171 --> 00:07:48.703\nwhere I have to make the leap\nmyself, in my own head,\n\n00:07:48.727 --> 00:07:50.655\nwill stop the flow of the presentation.\n\n00:07:50.679 --> 00:07:53.260\nSo you've got to take me\nthrough like a sixth-grader --\n\n00:07:53.284 --> 00:07:55.347\ndub, dub, dub --\nbut without patronizing me.\n\n00:07:55.371 --> 00:07:56.934\nAnd it's a very tricky path.\n\n00:07:56.958 --> 00:07:59.089\nBut if you can do it,\nit works really well.\n\n00:07:59.113 --> 00:08:02.795\nAnything that's inconsistent\nwithin your concept --\n\n00:08:02.819 --> 00:08:05.495\nif you tell me sales of X, Y or Z\nare 10 million dollars,\n\n00:08:05.519 --> 00:08:07.953\nfive slides later,\nthey're five million dollars ...\n\n00:08:07.977 --> 00:08:10.761\nOne may have been gross sales,\none may have been net sales,\n\n00:08:10.785 --> 00:08:13.668\nbut I want to know that all the numbers\nmake sense together.\n\n00:08:13.692 --> 00:08:16.231\nAnd then, finally: anything\nthat's an error or a typo,\n\n00:08:16.255 --> 00:08:19.128\nor a stupid mistake or a line\nthat's in the wrong place --\n\n00:08:19.152 --> 00:08:22.781\nthat shows me that if you can't do\na presentation, how can you run a company?\n\n00:08:22.805 --> 00:08:24.677\nSo this all feeds in together.\n\n00:08:24.701 --> 00:08:27.054\nThe best way to do this\nis to look at our betters,\n\n00:08:27.078 --> 00:08:28.673\npeople who have done this before.\n\n00:08:28.697 --> 00:08:32.075\nLet's look at the most successful\ntechnology executive in the business,\n\n00:08:32.099 --> 00:08:33.911\nand see how a presentation goes.\n\n00:08:34.336 --> 00:08:36.569\nBill Gates's PowerPoint\npresentation over here.\n\n00:08:36.593 --> 00:08:38.641\nHere's Gates doing a thing for Windows.\n\n00:08:38.665 --> 00:08:41.791\nIs this how to do a PowerPoint\npresentation? What do you think?\n\n00:08:41.815 --> 00:08:44.498\nNo. Who do you think we should\nlook at as our role model?\n\n00:08:44.522 --> 00:08:47.322\nOh, isn't that funny!\nThere's another great one over here.\n\n00:08:47.346 --> 00:08:48.527\nOK, Steve Jobs.\n\n00:08:48.551 --> 00:08:52.037\nYou want absolute --\nthis is the Zen of presentation, right?\n\n00:08:52.061 --> 00:08:54.847\nHere he is, one little guy,\nblack jeans and stuff,\n\n00:08:54.871 --> 00:08:56.063\non a totally empty stage.\n\n00:08:56.087 --> 00:08:57.665\nWhat are you focusing on?\n\n00:08:57.689 --> 00:08:59.738\nYou're focusing on him!\nThis is Steve Jobs.\n\n00:08:59.762 --> 00:09:03.722\nSo are these wonderful long bullet points,\nwhole list of things good?\n\n00:09:03.746 --> 00:09:06.277\nNo, they're not. The long\nbullet points are bad.\n\n00:09:06.301 --> 00:09:08.886\nWhat's good? Short. Short bullet points.\n\n00:09:08.910 --> 00:09:12.566\nBut you know what? Even better than short\nbullet points are no bullet points.\n\n00:09:12.590 --> 00:09:13.835\nJust give me the headline.\n\n00:09:13.859 --> 00:09:15.010\nAnd you know what?\n\n00:09:15.034 --> 00:09:17.058\nHow many bullet points\ndoes Steve Jobs use?\n\n00:09:17.082 --> 00:09:18.453\nBasically, none.\n\n00:09:18.477 --> 00:09:19.629\nWhat do you do?\n\n00:09:19.653 --> 00:09:22.489\nBest of all, images. Just a simple image.\n\n00:09:22.513 --> 00:09:25.144\nI look at the image;\na picture's worth a thousand words.\n\n00:09:25.168 --> 00:09:27.652\nYou look at the image\nand you've got the whole thing.\n\n00:09:27.676 --> 00:09:31.110\nThen you come back to me; you're focused\non me, why I'm such a great guy,\n\n00:09:31.134 --> 00:09:33.444\nwhy you want to invest,\nwhy this all makes sense.\n\n00:09:33.468 --> 00:09:35.559\nThat said, we only have a very short time,\n\n00:09:35.583 --> 00:09:38.621\nso let's run through the things\nto include in your presentation.\n\n00:09:38.645 --> 00:09:41.126\nFirst of all, none of these big,\nlong-titled slides\n\n00:09:41.150 --> 00:09:43.729\nwith blah, blah, I'm presenting\nto so-and-so on X date.\n\n00:09:43.753 --> 00:09:46.475\nI know the day, I know who I am --\nI don't need all that.\n\n00:09:46.499 --> 00:09:47.999\nJust give me your company logo.\n\n00:09:48.023 --> 00:09:50.230\nI look at the logo,\nand it ties it to my brain.\n\n00:09:50.254 --> 00:09:53.650\nThen I come back to you.\nI'm focused on you, OK?\n\n00:09:53.674 --> 00:09:57.599\nYou give me your quick, 15-second\nor 30-second intro, grab my attention.\n\n00:09:57.623 --> 00:09:59.628\nThen you give me\na quick business overview.\n\n00:09:59.652 --> 00:10:02.779\nThis is not a five-minute pitch.\nThis is, you know, two sentences.\n\n00:10:02.803 --> 00:10:04.832\n\"We build widgets for the X, Y, Z market.\"\n\n00:10:04.856 --> 00:10:07.518\nOr, \"We sell services to help do X.\"\nYou know, whatever.\n\n00:10:07.542 --> 00:10:10.706\nAnd that is like the picture\non the outside of a jigsaw puzzle box.\n\n00:10:10.730 --> 00:10:12.187\nThat lets me know the context.\n\n00:10:12.211 --> 00:10:15.463\nIt gives me the armature for the whole\nthing you'll be going through;\n\n00:10:15.487 --> 00:10:18.349\nit lets me put everything\nin relation to what you've told me.\n\n00:10:18.373 --> 00:10:22.655\nThen you've got to walk me through,\nshow me who your management team is.\n\n00:10:22.679 --> 00:10:26.228\nI want to know the size of the market.\nWhy is this market worth getting at?\n\n00:10:26.252 --> 00:10:28.662\nI want to know your product,\nthat's very important.\n\n00:10:28.686 --> 00:10:30.937\nNow, this is not\na product pitch or sales pitch.\n\n00:10:30.961 --> 00:10:34.154\nI don't want to know all the ins and outs,\njust what the heck is it?\n\n00:10:34.178 --> 00:10:37.240\nIf it's a website, show me\na screenshot of your website.\n\n00:10:37.264 --> 00:10:39.276\nDon't do a live demo.\nNever do a live demo.\n\n00:10:39.300 --> 00:10:41.550\nDo a canned demo,\nor something that lets me know\n\n00:10:41.574 --> 00:10:43.732\nwhy people are going\nto buy whatever it is.\n\n00:10:43.756 --> 00:10:45.996\nNow that I know what you're selling,\n\n00:10:46.020 --> 00:10:47.595\ntell me how you make money on it.\n\n00:10:47.619 --> 00:10:52.101\nFor every X you sell, you get Y,\nor services of Z.\n\n00:10:52.125 --> 00:10:55.071\nI want to know what the business model\nis on a per-unit basis,\n\n00:10:55.095 --> 00:10:57.055\nor for the actual product you're selling.\n\n00:10:57.079 --> 00:10:59.799\nI want to know who you're selling to\nin terms of customers\n\n00:10:59.823 --> 00:11:02.709\nand if you have any special\nrelationships that will help you,\n\n00:11:02.733 --> 00:11:05.743\nwhether it's a distribution relationship\nor a producing partner.\n\n00:11:05.767 --> 00:11:06.918\nAgain, validation.\n\n00:11:06.942 --> 00:11:10.193\nThis helps to say you're bigger\nthan just one little thing over here.\n\n00:11:10.217 --> 00:11:11.653\nBut everybody has competition.\n\n00:11:11.677 --> 00:11:13.987\nThere's never been a company\nwith no competition,\n\n00:11:14.011 --> 00:11:16.740\neven if the competition\nis the old way of doing something.\n\n00:11:16.764 --> 00:11:19.044\nI want to know exactly\nwhat your competition is,\n\n00:11:19.068 --> 00:11:22.135\nand that will help me judge\nhow you fit into the whole operation.\n\n00:11:22.159 --> 00:11:23.822\nI want to know how you're special.\n\n00:11:23.846 --> 00:11:25.568\nI know what your competition does --\n\n00:11:25.592 --> 00:11:28.267\nhow are you going to prevent\nthem from eating your lunch?\n\n00:11:28.291 --> 00:11:30.299\nAll this ties into the financial overview.\n\n00:11:30.323 --> 00:11:33.251\nAnd you can't do a VC pitch\nwithout giving me your financials.\n\n00:11:33.275 --> 00:11:36.781\nI want to know a year or two back,\nor as long as you've been in existence.\n\n00:11:36.805 --> 00:11:39.050\nAnd I want to know\nfour or five years forward.\n\n00:11:39.074 --> 00:11:40.703\nFive is a bit much. Probably four.\n\n00:11:40.727 --> 00:11:43.693\nAnd I want to know how that business\nmodel, on a product basis,\n\n00:11:43.717 --> 00:11:46.921\nwill translate into a company model:\nHow many widgets will you sell?\n\n00:11:46.945 --> 00:11:49.948\nYou make X amount per widget.\nI want to know what the driver is.\n\n00:11:49.972 --> 00:11:52.643\nWe'll have 1,000 customers\nthis year and 10,000 the next,\n\n00:11:52.667 --> 00:11:54.338\nour revenues will do this and that.\n\n00:11:54.362 --> 00:11:57.083\nThat gives me the whole picture\nfor the next several years\n\n00:11:57.107 --> 00:11:58.301\ninto which I'm investing.\n\n00:11:58.325 --> 00:12:01.386\nAnd I want to know how the money\nfrom me will help you get there.\n\n00:12:01.410 --> 00:12:03.651\nYou're going to open\nan offshore plant in China,\n\n00:12:03.675 --> 00:12:06.114\nyou're going to spend it all\non sales and marketing,\n\n00:12:06.138 --> 00:12:08.001\nyou're going to go to Tahiti, whatever.\n\n00:12:08.025 --> 00:12:10.841\nBut then comes the ask,\nwhere you tell me how much you want.\n\n00:12:10.865 --> 00:12:13.336\nYou're looking for 5 million --\nat what valuation?\n\n00:12:13.360 --> 00:12:15.570\nTwo million? 100,000?\n\n00:12:15.594 --> 00:12:17.569\nWhat's the money in so far?

They're incredibly complex. They can't \u2014 I have no idea of how they work. But thinking is really very straightforward: it's just sort of some kind of logical reasoning, or something. But that's not the hard part.\"So here's a list of problems that come up. One nice problem is, what do we do about health? The other day, I was reading something, and the person said probably the largest single cause of disease is handshaking in the West. And there was a little study about people who don't handshake, and comparing them with ones who do handshake. And I haven't the foggiest idea of where you find the ones that don't handshake, because they must be hiding. And the people who avoid that have 30 percent less infectious disease or something. Or maybe it was 31 and a quarter percent. So if you really want to solve the problem of epidemics and so forth, let's start with that. And since I got that idea, I've had to shake hundreds of hands. And I think the only way to avoid it is to have some horrible visible disease, and then you don't have to explain.Education: how do we improve education? Well, the single best way is to get them to understand that what they're being told is a whole lot of nonsense. And then, of course, you have to do something about how to moderate that, so that anybody can \u2014 so they'll listen to you. Pollution, energy shortage, environmental diversity, poverty. How do we make stable societies? Longevity. Okay, there're lots of problems to worry about.Anyway, the question I think people should talk about \u2014 and it's absolutely taboo \u2014 is, how many people should there be? And I think it should be about 100 million or maybe 500 million. And then notice that a great many of these problems disappear. If you had 100 million people properly spread out, then if there's some garbage, you throw it away, preferably where you can't see it, and it will rot. Or you throw it into the ocean and some fish will benefit from it. The problem is, how many people should there be? And it's a sort of choice we have to make.Most people are about 60 inches high or more, and there's these cube laws. So if you make them this big, by using nanotechnology, I suppose \u2014 (Laughter) \u2014 then you could have a thousand times as many. That would solve the problem, but I don't see anybody doing any research on making people smaller. Now, it's nice to reduce the population, but a lot of people want to have children. And there's one solution that's probably only a few years off. You know you have 46 chromosomes. If you're lucky, you've got 23 from each parent. Sometimes you get an extra one or drop one out, but \u2014 so you can skip the grandparent and great-grandparent stage and go right to the great-great-grandparent. And you have 46 people and you give them a scanner, or whatever you need, and they look at their chromosomes and each of them says which one he likes best, or she \u2014 no reason to have just two sexes any more, even. So each child has 46 parents, and I suppose you could let each group of 46 parents have 15 children. Wouldn't that be enough? And then the children would get plenty of support, and nurturing, and mentoring, and the world population would decline very rapidly and everybody would be totally happy.Timesharing is a little further off in the future. And there's this great novel that Arthur Clarke wrote twice, called \"Against the Fall of Night\" and \"The City and the Stars.\" They're both wonderful and largely the same, except that computers happened in between. And Arthur was looking at this old book, and he said, \"Well, that was wrong. The future must have some computers.\" So in the second version of it, there are 100 billion or 1,000 billion people on Earth, but they're all stored on hard disks or floppies, or whatever they have in the future. And you let a few million of them out at a time. A person comes out, they live for a thousand years doing whatever they do, and then, when it's time to go back for a billion years \u2014 or a million, I forget, the numbers don't matter \u2014 but there really aren't very many people on Earth at a time. And you get to think about yourself and your memories, and before you go back into suspension, you edit your memories and you change your personality and so forth. The plot of the book is that there's not enough diversity, so that the people who designed the city make sure that every now and then an entirely new person is created. And in the novel, a particular one named Alvin is created. And he says, maybe this isn't the best way, and wrecks the whole system.I don't think the solutions that I proposed are good enough or smart enough. I think the big problem is that we're not smart enough to understand which of the problems we're facing are good enough. Therefore, we have to build super intelligent machines like HAL. As you remember, at some point in the book for \"2001,\" HAL realizes that the universe is too big, and grand, and profound for those really stupid astronauts. If you contrast HAL's behavior with the triviality of the people on the spaceship, you can see what's written between the lines. Well, what are we going to do about that? We could get smarter. I think that we're pretty smart, as compared to chimpanzees, but we're not smart enough to deal with the colossal problems that we face, either in abstract mathematics or in figuring out economies, or balancing the world around. So one thing we can do is live longer. And nobody knows how hard that is, but we'll probably find out in a few years. You see, there's two forks in the road. We know that people live twice as long as chimpanzees almost, and nobody lives more than 120 years, for reasons that aren't very well understood. But lots of people now live to 90 or 100, unless they shake hands too much or something like that. And so maybe if we lived 200 years, we could accumulate enough skills and knowledge to solve some problems. So that's one way of going about it. And as I said, we don't know how hard that is. It might be \u2014 after all, most other mammals live half as long as the chimpanzee, so we're sort of three and a half or four times, have four times the longevity of most mammals. And in the case of the primates, we have almost the same genes. We only differ from chimpanzees, in the present state of knowledge, which is absolute hogwash, maybe by just a few hundred genes.What I think is that the gene counters don't know what they're doing yet. And whatever you do, don't read anything about genetics that's published within your lifetime, or something. (Laughter) The stuff has a very short half-life, same with brain science. And so it might be that if we just fix four or five genes, we can live 200 years. Or it might be that it's just 30 or 40, and I doubt that it's several hundred. So this is something that people will be discussing and lots of ethicists \u2014 you know, an ethicist is somebody who sees something wrong with whatever you have in mind. (Laughter) And it's very hard to find an ethicist who considers any change worth making, because he says, what about the consequences? And, of course, we're not responsible for the consequences of what we're doing now, are we? Like all this complaint about clones. And yet two random people will mate and have this child, and both of them have some pretty rotten genes, and the child is likely to come out to be average. Which, by chimpanzee standards, is very good indeed.If we do have longevity, then we'll have to face the population growth problem anyway. Because if people live 200 or 1,000 years, then we can't let them have a child more than about once every 200 or 1,000 years. And so there won't be any workforce. And one of the things Laurie Garrett pointed out, and others have, is that a society that doesn't have people of working age is in real trouble. And things are going to get worse, because there's nobody to educate the children or to feed the old. And when I'm talking about a long lifetime, of course, I don't want somebody who's 200 years old to be like our image of what a 200-year-old is \u2014 which is dead, actually.You know, there's about 400 different parts of the brain which seem to have different functions. Nobody knows how most of them work in detail, but we do know that there're lots of different things in there. And they don't always work together. I like Freud's theory that most of them are cancelling each other out. And so if you think of yourself as a sort of city with a hundred resources, then, when you're afraid, for example, you may discard your long-range goals, but you may think deeply and focus on exactly how to achieve that particular goal. You throw everything else away. You become a monomaniac \u2014 all you care about is not stepping out on that platform. And when you're hungry, food becomes more attractive, and so forth. So I see emotions as highly evolved subsets of your capability. Emotion is not something added to thought. An emotional state is what you get when you remove 100 or 200 of your normally available resources.So thinking of emotions as the opposite of \u2014 as something less than thinking is immensely productive. And I hope, in the next few years, to show that this will lead to smart machines. And I guess I better skip all the rest of this, which are some details on how we might make those smart machines and \u2014 (Laughter) \u2014 and the main idea is in fact that the core of a really smart machine is one that recognizes that a certain kind of problem is facing you. This is a problem of such and such a type, and therefore there's a certain way or ways of thinking that are good for that problem. So I think the future, main problem of psychology is to classify types of predicaments, types of situations, types of obstacles and also to classify available and possible ways to think and pair them up. So you see, it's almost like a Pavlovian \u2014 we lost the first hundred years of psychology by really trivial theories, where you say, how do people learn how to react to a situation? What I'm saying is, after we go through a lot of levels, including designing a huge, messy system with thousands of ports, we'll end up again with the central problem of psychology. Saying, not what are the situations, but what are the kinds of problems and what are the kinds of strategies, how do you learn them, how do you connect them up, how does a really creative person invent a new way of thinking out of the available resources and so forth.So, I think in the next 20 years, if we can get rid of all of the traditional approaches to artificial intelligence, like neural nets and genetic algorithms and rule-based systems, and just turn our sights a little bit higher to say, can we make a system that can use all those things for the right kind of problem? Some problems are good for neural nets; we know that others, neural nets are hopeless on them. Genetic algorithms are great for certain things; I suspect I know what they're bad at, and I won't tell you. (Laughter)Thank you.

They can't -- I have no idea of how they work.\n\n00:00:29.958 --> 00:00:31.958\nBut thinking is really very straightforward:\n\n00:00:31.958 --> 00:00:35.958\nit's just sort of some kind of logical reasoning, or something.\n\n00:00:35.958 --> 00:00:38.958\nBut that's not the hard part.\"\n\n00:00:38.958 --> 00:00:40.958\nSo here's a list of problems that come up.\n\n00:00:40.958 --> 00:00:43.958\nOne nice problem is, what do we do about health?\n\n00:00:43.958 --> 00:00:47.958\nThe other day, I was reading something, and the person said\n\n00:00:47.958 --> 00:00:53.958\nprobably the largest single cause of disease is handshaking in the West.\n\n00:00:53.958 --> 00:00:57.958\nAnd there was a little study about people who don't handshake,\n\n00:00:57.958 --> 00:01:00.958\nand comparing them with ones who do handshake.\n\n00:01:00.958 --> 00:01:05.958\nAnd I haven't the foggiest idea of where you find the ones that don't handshake,\n\n00:01:05.958 --> 00:01:08.958\nbecause they must be hiding.\n\n00:01:08.958 --> 00:01:12.958\nAnd the people who avoid that\n\n00:01:12.958 --> 00:01:16.958\nhave 30 percent less infectious disease or something.\n\n00:01:16.958 --> 00:01:19.958\nOr maybe it was 31 and a quarter percent.\n\n00:01:19.958 --> 00:01:23.958\nSo if you really want to solve the problem of epidemics and so forth,\n\n00:01:23.958 --> 00:01:27.958\nlet's start with that. And since I got that idea,\n\n00:01:27.958 --> 00:01:31.958\nI've had to shake hundreds of hands.\n\n00:01:31.958 --> 00:01:36.958\nAnd I think the only way to avoid it\n\n00:01:36.958 --> 00:01:38.958\nis to have some horrible visible disease,\n\n00:01:38.958 --> 00:01:41.958\nand then you don't have to explain.\n\n00:01:41.958 --> 00:01:45.958\nEducation: how do we improve education?\n\n00:01:45.958 --> 00:01:49.958\nWell, the single best way is to get them to understand\n\n00:01:49.958 --> 00:01:52.958\nthat what they're being told is a whole lot of nonsense.\n\n00:01:52.958 --> 00:01:54.958\nAnd then, of course, you have to do something\n\n00:01:54.958 --> 00:01:59.958\nabout how to moderate that, so that anybody can -- so they'll listen to you.\n\n00:01:59.958 --> 00:02:03.958\nPollution, energy shortage, environmental diversity, poverty.\n\n00:02:03.958 --> 00:02:07.958\nHow do we make stable societies? Longevity.\n\n00:02:07.958 --> 00:02:10.958\nOkay, there're lots of problems to worry about.\n\n00:02:10.958 --> 00:02:12.958\nAnyway, the question I think people should talk about --\n\n00:02:12.958 --> 00:02:17.958\nand it's absolutely taboo -- is, how many people should there be?\n\n00:02:17.958 --> 00:02:24.958\nAnd I think it should be about 100 million or maybe 500 million.\n\n00:02:24.958 --> 00:02:29.958\nAnd then notice that a great many of these problems disappear.\n\n00:02:29.958 --> 00:02:31.958\nIf you had 100 million people\n\n00:02:31.958 --> 00:02:37.958\nproperly spread out, then if there's some garbage,\n\n00:02:37.958 --> 00:02:44.958\nyou throw it away, preferably where you can't see it, and it will rot.\n\n00:02:44.958 --> 00:02:49.958\nOr you throw it into the ocean and some fish will benefit from it.\n\n00:02:49.958 --> 00:02:51.958\nThe problem is, how many people should there be?\n\n00:02:51.958 --> 00:02:54.958\nAnd it's a sort of choice we have to make.\n\n00:02:54.958 --> 00:02:57.958\nMost people are about 60 inches high or more,\n\n00:02:57.958 --> 00:03:01.958\nand there's these cube laws. So if you make them this big,\n\n00:03:01.958 --> 00:03:04.958\nby using nanotechnology, I suppose --\n\n00:03:04.958 --> 00:03:05.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:03:05.958 --> 00:03:07.958\n-- then you could have a thousand times as many.\n\n00:03:07.958 --> 00:03:09.958\nThat would solve the problem, but I don't see anybody\n\n00:03:09.958 --> 00:03:12.958\ndoing any research on making people smaller.\n\n00:03:12.958 --> 00:03:17.958\nNow, it's nice to reduce the population, but a lot of people want to have children.\n\n00:03:17.958 --> 00:03:20.958\nAnd there's one solution that's probably only a few years off.\n\n00:03:20.958 --> 00:03:25.958\nYou know you have 46 chromosomes. If you're lucky, you've got 23\n\n00:03:25.958 --> 00:03:31.958\nfrom each parent. Sometimes you get an extra one or drop one out,\n\n00:03:31.958 --> 00:03:35.958\nbut -- so you can skip the grandparent and great-grandparent stage\n\n00:03:35.958 --> 00:03:40.958\nand go right to the great-great-grandparent. And you have 46 people\n\n00:03:40.958 --> 00:03:43.958\nand you give them a scanner, or whatever you need,\n\n00:03:43.958 --> 00:03:47.958\nand they look at their chromosomes and each of them says\n\n00:03:47.958 --> 00:03:52.958\nwhich one he likes best, or she -- no reason to have just two sexes\n\n00:03:52.958 --> 00:03:57.958\nany more, even. So each child has 46 parents,\n\n00:03:57.958 --> 00:04:03.958\nand I suppose you could let each group of 46 parents have 15 children.\n\n00:04:03.958 --> 00:04:05.958\nWouldn't that be enough? And then the children\n\n00:04:05.958 --> 00:04:09.958\nwould get plenty of support, and nurturing, and mentoring,\n\n00:04:09.958 --> 00:04:11.958\nand the world population would decline very rapidly\n\n00:04:11.958 --> 00:04:14.958\nand everybody would be totally happy.\n\n00:04:14.958 --> 00:04:17.958\nTimesharing is a little further off in the future.\n\n00:04:17.958 --> 00:04:20.958\nAnd there's this great novel that Arthur Clarke wrote twice,\n\n00:04:20.958 --> 00:04:24.958\ncalled \"Against the Fall of Night\" and \"The City and the Stars.\"\n\n00:04:24.958 --> 00:04:27.958\nThey're both wonderful and largely the same,\n\n00:04:27.958 --> 00:04:29.958\nexcept that computers happened in between.\n\n00:04:29.958 --> 00:04:34.958\nAnd Arthur was looking at this old book, and he said, \"Well, that was wrong.\n\n00:04:34.958 --> 00:04:36.958\nThe future must have some computers.\"\n\n00:04:36.958 --> 00:04:41.958\nSo in the second version of it, there are 100 billion\n\n00:04:41.958 --> 00:04:49.958\nor 1,000 billion people on Earth, but they're all stored on hard disks or floppies,\n\n00:04:49.958 --> 00:04:51.958\nor whatever they have in the future.\n\n00:04:51.958 --> 00:04:55.958\nAnd you let a few million of them out at a time.\n\n00:04:55.958 --> 00:04:59.958\nA person comes out, they live for a thousand years\n\n00:04:59.958 --> 00:05:05.958\ndoing whatever they do, and then, when it's time to go back\n\n00:05:05.958 --> 00:05:09.958\nfor a billion years -- or a million, I forget, the numbers don't matter --\n\n00:05:09.958 --> 00:05:13.958\nbut there really aren't very many people on Earth at a time.\n\n00:05:13.958 --> 00:05:15.958\nAnd you get to think about yourself and your memories,\n\n00:05:15.958 --> 00:05:20.958\nand before you go back into suspension, you edit your memories\n\n00:05:20.958 --> 00:05:23.958\nand you change your personality and so forth.\n\n00:05:23.958 --> 00:05:29.958\nThe plot of the book is that there's not enough diversity,\n\n00:05:29.958 --> 00:05:32.958\nso that the people who designed the city\n\n00:05:32.958 --> 00:05:36.958\nmake sure that every now and then an entirely new person is created.\n\n00:05:36.958 --> 00:05:42.958\nAnd in the novel, a particular one named Alvin is created. And he says,\n\n00:05:42.958 --> 00:05:46.958\nmaybe this isn't the best way, and wrecks the whole system.\n\n00:05:46.958 --> 00:05:48.958\nI don't think the solutions that I proposed\n\n00:05:48.958 --> 00:05:51.958\nare good enough or smart enough.\n\n00:05:51.958 --> 00:05:55.958\nI think the big problem is that we're not smart enough\n\n00:05:55.958 --> 00:05:59.958\nto understand which of the problems we're facing are good enough.\n\n00:05:59.958 --> 00:06:03.958\nTherefore, we have to build super intelligent machines like HAL.\n\n00:06:03.958 --> 00:06:08.958\nAs you remember, at some point in the book for \"2001,\"\n\n00:06:08.958 --> 00:06:13.958\nHAL realizes that the universe is too big, and grand, and profound\n\n00:06:13.958 --> 00:06:17.958\nfor those really stupid astronauts. If you contrast HAL's behavior\n\n00:06:17.958 --> 00:06:21.958\nwith the triviality of the people on the spaceship,\n\n00:06:21.958 --> 00:06:24.958\nyou can see what's written between the lines.\n\n00:06:24.958 --> 00:06:27.958\nWell, what are we going to do about that? We could get smarter.\n\n00:06:27.958 --> 00:06:32.958\nI think that we're pretty smart, as compared to chimpanzees,\n\n00:06:32.958 --> 00:06:38.958\nbut we're not smart enough to deal with the colossal problems that we face,\n\n00:06:38.958 --> 00:06:40.958\neither in abstract mathematics\n\n00:06:40.958 --> 00:06:45.958\nor in figuring out economies, or balancing the world around.\n\n00:06:45.958 --> 00:06:48.958\nSo one thing we can do is live longer.\n\n00:06:48.958 --> 00:06:50.958\nAnd nobody knows how hard that is,\n\n00:06:50.958 --> 00:06:53.958\nbut we'll probably find out in a few years.\n\n00:06:53.958 --> 00:06:56.958\nYou see, there's two forks in the road. We know that people live\n\n00:06:56.958 --> 00:07:00.958\ntwice as long as chimpanzees almost,\n\n00:07:00.958 --> 00:07:04.958\nand nobody lives more than 120 years,\n\n00:07:04.958 --> 00:07:07.958\nfor reasons that aren't very well understood.\n\n00:07:07.958 --> 00:07:10.958\nBut lots of people now live to 90 or 100,\n\n00:07:10.958 --> 00:07:14.958\nunless they shake hands too much or something like that.\n\n00:07:14.958 --> 00:07:19.958\nAnd so maybe if we lived 200 years, we could accumulate enough skills\n\n00:07:19.958 --> 00:07:24.958\nand knowledge to solve some problems.\n\n00:07:24.958 --> 00:07:26.958\nSo that's one way of going about it.\n\n00:07:26.958 --> 00:07:29.958\nAnd as I said, we don't know how hard that is. It might be --\n\n00:07:29.958 --> 00:07:35.958\nafter all, most other mammals live half as long as the chimpanzee,\n\n00:07:35.958 --> 00:07:38.958\nso we're sort of three and a half or four times, have four times\n\n00:07:38.958 --> 00:07:44.958\nthe longevity of most mammals. And in the case of the primates,\n\n00:07:44.958 --> 00:07:48.958\nwe have almost the same genes. We only differ from chimpanzees,\n\n00:07:48.958 --> 00:07:54.958\nin the present state of knowledge, which is absolute hogwash,\n\n00:07:54.958 --> 00:07:56.958\nmaybe by just a few hundred genes.\n\n00:07:56.958 --> 00:07:59.958\nWhat I think is that the gene counters don't know what they're doing yet.\n\n00:07:59.958 --> 00:08:02.958\nAnd whatever you do, don't read anything about genetics\n\n00:08:02.958 --> 00:08:05.958\nthat's published within your lifetime, or something.\n\n00:08:05.958 --> 00:08:08.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:08:08.958 --> 00:08:12.958\nThe stuff has a very short half-life, same with brain science.\n\n00:08:12.958 --> 00:08:18.958\nAnd so it might be that if we just fix four or five genes,\n\n00:08:18.958 --> 00:08:20.958\nwe can live 200 years.\n\n00:08:20.958 --> 00:08:23.958\nOr it might be that it's just 30 or 40,\n\n00:08:23.958 --> 00:08:25.958\nand I doubt that it's several hundred.\n\n00:08:25.958 --> 00:08:29.958\nSo this is something that people will be discussing\n\n00:08:29.958 --> 00:08:32.958\nand lots of ethicists -- you know, an ethicist is somebody\n\n00:08:32.958 --> 00:08:35.958\nwho sees something wrong with whatever you have in mind.\n\n00:08:35.958 --> 00:08:38.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:08:38.958 --> 00:08:42.958\nAnd it's very hard to find an ethicist who considers any change\n\n00:08:42.958 --> 00:08:46.958\nworth making, because he says, what about the consequences?\n\n00:08:46.958 --> 00:08:49.958\nAnd, of course, we're not responsible for the consequences\n\n00:08:49.958 --> 00:08:55.958\nof what we're doing now, are we? Like all this complaint about clones.\n\n00:08:55.958 --> 00:08:58.958\nAnd yet two random people will mate and have this child,\n\n00:08:58.958 --> 00:09:02.958\nand both of them have some pretty rotten genes,\n\n00:09:02.958 --> 00:09:06.958\nand the child is likely to come out to be average.\n\n00:09:06.958 --> 00:09:12.958\nWhich, by chimpanzee standards, is very good indeed.\n\n00:09:12.958 --> 00:09:15.958\nIf we do have longevity, then we'll have to face the population growth\n\n00:09:15.958 --> 00:09:19.958\nproblem anyway. Because if people live 200 or 1,000 years,\n\n00:09:19.958 --> 00:09:25.958\nthen we can't let them have a child more than about once every 200 or 1,000 years.\n\n00:09:25.958 --> 00:09:28.958\nAnd so there won't be any workforce.\n\n00:09:28.958 --> 00:09:32.958\nAnd one of the things Laurie Garrett pointed out, and others have,\n\n00:09:32.958 --> 00:09:37.958\nis that a society that doesn't have people\n\n00:09:37.958 --> 00:09:40.958\nof working age is in real trouble. And things are going to get worse,\n\n00:09:40.958 --> 00:09:46.958\nbecause there's nobody to educate the children or to feed the old.\n\n00:09:46.958 --> 00:09:48.958\nAnd when I'm talking about a long lifetime, of course,\n\n00:09:48.958 --> 00:09:54.958\nI don't want somebody who's 200 years old to be like our image\n\n00:09:54.958 --> 00:09:58.958\nof what a 200-year-old is -- which is dead, actually.\n\n00:09:58.958 --> 00:10:00.958\nYou know, there's about 400 different parts of the brain\n\n00:10:00.958 --> 00:10:02.958\nwhich seem to have different functions.\n\n00:10:02.958 --> 00:10:05.958\nNobody knows how most of them work in detail,\n\n00:10:05.958 --> 00:10:09.958\nbut we do know that there're lots of different things in there.\n\n00:10:09.958 --> 00:10:11.958\nAnd they don't always work together. I like Freud's theory\n\n00:10:11.958 --> 00:10:15.958\nthat most of them are cancelling each other out.\n\n00:10:15.958 --> 00:10:19.958\nAnd so if you think of yourself as a sort of city\n\n00:10:19.958 --> 00:10:25.958\nwith a hundred resources, then, when you're afraid, for example,\n\n00:10:25.958 --> 00:10:29.958\nyou may discard your long-range goals, but you may think deeply\n\n00:10:29.958 --> 00:10:33.958\nand focus on exactly how to achieve that particular goal.\n\n00:10:33.958 --> 00:10:36.958\nYou throw everything else away. You become a monomaniac --\n\n00:10:36.958 --> 00:10:40.958\nall you care about is not stepping out on that platform.\n\n00:10:40.958 --> 00:10:44.958\nAnd when you're hungry, food becomes more attractive, and so forth.\n\n00:10:44.958 --> 00:10:50.958\nSo I see emotions as highly evolved subsets of your capability.\n\n00:10:50.958 --> 00:10:54.958\nEmotion is not something added to thought. An emotional state\n\n00:10:54.958 --> 00:10:58.958\nis what you get when you remove 100 or 200\n\n00:10:58.958 --> 00:11:01.958\nof your normally available resources.\n\n00:11:01.958 --> 00:11:04.958\nSo thinking of emotions as the opposite of -- as something\n\n00:11:04.958 --> 00:11:08.958\nless than thinking is immensely productive. And I hope,\n\n00:11:08.958 --> 00:11:12.958\nin the next few years, to show that this will lead to smart machines.\n\n00:11:12.958 --> 00:11:15.958\nAnd I guess I better skip all the rest of this, which are some details\n\n00:11:15.958 --> 00:11:20.958\non how we might make those smart machines and --\n\n00:11:20.958 --> 00:11:25.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:11:25.958 --> 00:11:30.958\n-- and the main idea is in fact that the core of a really smart machine\n\n00:11:30.958 --> 00:11:35.958\nis one that recognizes that a certain kind of problem is facing you.\n\n00:11:35.958 --> 00:11:38.958\nThis is a problem of such and such a type,\n\n00:11:38.958 --> 00:11:43.958\nand therefore there's a certain way or ways of thinking\n\n00:11:43.958 --> 00:11:45.958\nthat are good for that problem.\n\n00:11:45.958 --> 00:11:49.958\nSo I think the future, main problem of psychology is to classify\n\n00:11:49.958 --> 00:11:53.958\ntypes of predicaments, types of situations, types of obstacles\n\n00:11:53.958 --> 00:11:59.958\nand also to classify available and possible ways to think and pair them up.\n\n00:11:59.958 --> 00:12:02.958\nSo you see, it's almost like a Pavlovian --\n\n00:12:02.958 --> 00:12:04.958\nwe lost the first hundred years of psychology\n\n00:12:04.958 --> 00:12:07.958\nby really trivial theories, where you say,\n\n00:12:07.958 --> 00:12:13.958\nhow do people learn how to react to a situation? What I'm saying is,\n\n00:12:13.958 --> 00:12:18.958\nafter we go through a lot of levels, including designing\n\n00:12:18.958 --> 00:12:21.958\na huge, messy system with thousands of ports,\n\n00:12:21.958 --> 00:12:25.958\nwe'll end up again with the central problem of psychology.\n\n00:12:25.958 --> 00:12:28.958\nSaying, not what are the situations,\n\n00:12:28.958 --> 00:12:30.958\nbut what are the kinds of problems\n\n00:12:30.958 --> 00:12:33.958\nand what are the kinds of strategies, how do you learn them,\n\n00:12:33.958 --> 00:12:36.958\nhow do you connect them up, how does a really creative person\n\n00:12:36.958 --> 00:12:41.958\ninvent a new way of thinking out of the available resources and so forth.\n\n00:12:41.958 --> 00:12:43.958\nSo, I think in the next 20 years,\n\n00:12:43.958 --> 00:12:48.958\nif we can get rid of all of the traditional approaches to artificial intelligence,\n\n00:12:48.958 --> 00:12:50.958\nlike neural nets and genetic algorithms\n\n00:12:50.958 --> 00:12:56.958\nand rule-based systems, and just turn our sights a little bit higher to say,\n\n00:12:56.958 --> 00:12:58.958\ncan we make a system that can use all those things\n\n00:12:58.958 --> 00:13:02.958\nfor the right kind of problem? Some problems are good for neural nets;\n\n00:13:02.958 --> 00:13:05.958\nwe know that others, neural nets are hopeless on them.\n\n00:13:05.958 --> 00:13:08.958\nGenetic algorithms are great for certain things;\n\n00:13:08.958 --> 00:13:12.958\nI suspect I know what they're bad at, and I won't tell you.\n\n00:13:12.958 --> 00:13:13.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:13:13.958 --> 00:13:15.958\nThank you.\n\n00:13:15.958 --> 00:13:21.958\n(Applause)"}, {"title": "The psychology of evil", "duration": "1396", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/philip_zimbardo_on_the_psychology_of_evil", "transcript": "Philosophers, dramatists, theologians have grappled with this question for centuries: what makes people go wrong? Interestingly, I asked this question when I was a little kid. I grew up in the South Bronx, inner-city ghetto in New York, and I was surrounded by evil, as all kids are who grew up in an inner city. And I had friends who were really good kids, who lived out the Dr. Jekyll Mr. Hyde scenario \u2014 Robert Louis Stevenson. That is, they took drugs, got in trouble, went to jail. Some got killed, and some did it without drug assistance.So when I read Robert Louis Stevenson, that wasn't fiction. The only question is, what was in the juice? And more importantly, that line between good and evil \u2014 which privileged people like to think is fixed and impermeable, with them on the good side, the others on the bad side \u2014 I knew that line was movable, and it was permeable. Good people could be seduced across that line, and under good and some rare circumstances, bad kids could recover with help, with reform, with rehabilitation.So I want to begin with this wonderful illusion by [Dutch] artist M.C. Escher. If you look at it and focus on the white, what you see is a world full of angels. But let's look more deeply, and as we do, what appears is the demons, the devils in the world. That tells us several things.One, the world is, was, will always be filled with good and evil, because good and evil is the yin and yang of the human condition. It tells me something else. If you remember, God's favorite angel was Lucifer. Apparently, Lucifer means \"the light.\" It also means \"the morning star,\" in some scripture. And apparently, he disobeyed God, and that's the ultimate disobedience to authority. And when he did, Michael, the archangel, was sent to kick him out of heaven along with the other fallen angels. And so Lucifer descends into hell, becomes Satan, becomes the devil, and the force of evil in the universe begins.Paradoxically, it was God who created hell as a place to store evil. He didn't do a good job of keeping it there though. So, this arc of the cosmic transformation of God's favorite angel into the Devil, for me, sets the context for understanding human beings who are transformed from good, ordinary people into perpetrators of evil.So the Lucifer effect, although it focuses on the negatives \u2014 the negatives that people can become, not the negatives that people are \u2014 leads me to a psychological definition. Evil is the exercise of power. And that's the key: it's about power. To intentionally harm people psychologically, to hurt people physically, to destroy people mortally, or ideas, and to commit crimes against humanity. If you Google \"evil,\" a word that should surely have withered by now, you come up with 136 million hits in a third of a second.A few years ago \u2014 I am sure all of you were shocked, as I was, with the revelation of American soldiers abusing prisoners in a strange place in a controversial war, Abu Ghraib in Iraq. And these were men and women who were putting prisoners through unbelievable humiliation. I was shocked, but I wasn't surprised, because I had seen those same visual parallels when I was the prison superintendent of the Stanford Prison Study.Immediately the Bush administration military said what? What all administrations say when there's a scandal: \"Don't blame us. It's not the system. It's the few bad apples, the few rogue soldiers.\" My hypothesis is, American soldiers are good, usually. Maybe it was the barrel that was bad. But how am I going to deal with that hypothesis?I became an expert witness for one of the guards, Sergeant Chip Frederick, and in that position, I had access to the dozen investigative reports. I had access to him. I could study him, have him come to my home, get to know him, do psychological analysis to see, was he a good apple or bad apple. And thirdly, I had access to all of the 1,000 pictures that these soldiers took. These pictures are of a violent or sexual nature. All of them come from the cameras of American soldiers. Because everybody has a digital camera or cell phone camera, they took pictures of everything, more than 1,000.And what I've done is I organized them into various categories. But these are by United States military police, army reservists. They are not soldiers prepared for this mission at all. And it all happened in a single place, Tier 1-A, on the night shift. Why? Tier 1-A was the center for military intelligence. It was the interrogation hold. The CIA was there. Interrogators from Titan Corporation, all there, and they're getting no information about the insurgency. So they're going to put pressure on these soldiers, military police, to cross the line, give them permission to break the will of the enemy, to prepare them for interrogation, to soften them up, to take the gloves off. Those are the euphemisms, and this is how it was interpreted. Let's go down to that dungeon.(Typewriting)[Abu Ghraib Iraq Prison Abuses 2008 Military Police Guards' Photos][The following images include nudity and graphic depictions of violence](Camera shutter sounds)(Thuds)(Camera shutter)(Camera shutter)(Breathing)(Bells)(Bells end)So, pretty horrific. That's one of the visual illustrations of evil. And it should not have escaped you that the reason I paired the prisoner with his arms out with Leonardo da Vinci's ode to humanity is that that prisoner was mentally ill. That prisoner covered himself with shit every day, they had to roll him in dirt so he wouldn't stink. But the guards ended up calling him \"Shit Boy.\" What was he doing in that prison rather than in some mental institution?In any event, here's former Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld. He comes down and says, \"I want to know, who is responsible? Who are the bad apples?\" Well, that's a bad question. You have to reframe it and ask, \"What is responsible?\" \"What\" could be the who of people, but it could also be the what of the situation, and obviously that's wrongheaded.How do psychologists try to understand such transformations of human character, if you believe that they were good soldiers before they went down to that dungeon? There are three ways. The main way is called dispositional. We look at what's inside of the person, the bad apples.This is the foundation of all of social science, the foundation of religion, the foundation of war. Social psychologists like me come along and say, \"Yeah, people are the actors on the stage, but you'll have to be aware of the situation. Who are the cast of characters? What's the costume? Is there a stage director?\" And so we're interested in what are the external factors around the individual \u2014 the bad barrel? Social scientists stop there and they miss the big point that I discovered when I became an expert witness for Abu Ghraib. The power is in the system. The system creates the situation that corrupts the individuals, and the system is the legal, political, economic, cultural background. And this is where the power is of the bad-barrel makers.If you want to change a person, change the situation. And to change it, you've got to know where the power is, in the system. So the Lucifer effect involves understanding human character transformations with these three factors. And it's a dynamic interplay. What do the people bring into the situation? What does the situation bring out of them? And what is the system that creates and maintains that situation?My recent book, \"The Lucifer Effect,\" is about, how do you understand how good people turn evil? And it has a lot of detail about what I'm going to talk about today. So Dr. Z's \"Lucifer Effect,\" although it focuses on evil, really is a celebration of the human mind's infinite capacity to make any of us kind or cruel, caring or indifferent, creative or destructive, and it makes some of us villains. And the good news that I'm going to hopefully come to at the end is that it makes some of us heroes. This wonderful cartoon in the New Yorker summarizes my whole talk: \"I'm neither a good cop nor a bad cop, Jerome. Like yourself, I'm a complex amalgam of positive and negative personality traits that emerge or not, depending on the circumstances.\"(Laughter)There's a study some of you think you know about, but very few people have ever read the story. You watched the movie. This is Stanley Milgram, little Jewish kid from the Bronx, and he asked the question, \"Could the Holocaust happen here, now?\" People say, \"No, that's Nazi Germany, Hitler, you know, that's 1939.\" He said, \"Yeah, but suppose Hitler asked you, 'Would you electrocute a stranger?' 'No way, I'm a good person.'\" He said, \"Why don't we put you in a situation and give you a chance to see what you would do?\"And so what he did was he tested 1,000 ordinary people. 500 New Haven, Connecticut, 500 Bridgeport. And the ad said, \"Psychologists want to understand memory. We want to improve people's memory, because it is the key to success.\" OK? \"We're going to give you five bucks \u2014 four dollars for your time. We don't want college students. We want men between 20 and 50.\" In the later studies, they ran women. Ordinary people: barbers, clerks, white-collar people.So, you go down, one of you will be a learner, one will be a teacher. The learner's a genial, middle-aged guy. He gets tied up to the shock apparatus in another room. The learner could be middle-aged, could be as young as 20. And one of you is told by the authority, the guy in the lab coat, \"Your job as teacher is to give him material to learn. Gets it right, reward. Gets it wrong, you press a button on the shock box. The first button is 15 volts. He doesn't even feel it.\" That's the key. All evil starts with 15 volts. And then the next step is another 15 volts. The problem is, at the end of the line, it's 450 volts. And as you go along, the guy is screaming, \"I've got a heart condition! I'm out of here!\"You're a good person. You complain. \"Sir, who will be responsible if something happens to him?\" The experimenter says, \"Don't worry, I will be responsible. Continue, teacher.\" And the question is, who would go all the way to 450 volts? You should notice here, when it gets up to 375, it says, \"Danger. Severe Shock.\" When it gets up to here, there's \"XXX\" \u2014 the pornography of power.So Milgram asks 40 psychiatrists, \"What percent of American citizens would go to the end?\" They said only one percent. Because that's sadistic behavior, and we know, psychiatry knows, only one percent of Americans are sadistic. OK. Here's the data. They could not be more wrong. Two thirds go all the way to 450 volts. This was just one study. Milgram did more than 16 studies. And look at this. In study 16, where you see somebody like you go all the way, 90 percent go all the way. In study five, if you see people rebel, 90 percent rebel. What about women? Study 13 \u2014 no different than men. So Milgram is quantifying evil as the willingness of people to blindly obey authority, to go all the way to 450 volts. And it's like a dial on human nature. A dial in a sense that you can make almost everybody totally obedient, down to the majority, down to none.What are the external parallels? For all research is artificial. What's the validity in the real world? 912 American citizens committed suicide or were murdered by family and friends in Guyana jungle in 1978, because they were blindly obedient to this guy, their pastor \u2014 not their priest \u2014 their pastor, Reverend Jim Jones. He persuaded them to commit mass suicide. And so, he's the modern Lucifer effect, a man of God who becomes the Angel of Death. Milgram's study is all about individual authority to control people. Most of the time, we are in institutions, so the Stanford Prison Study is a study of the power of institutions to influence individual behavior. Interestingly, Stanley Milgram and I were in the same high school class in James Monroe in the Bronx, 1954.I did this study with my graduate students, especially Craig Haney \u2014 and it also began work with an ad. We had a cheap, little ad, but we wanted college students for a study of prison life. 75 people volunteered, took personality tests. We did interviews. Picked two dozen: the most normal, the most healthy. Randomly assigned them to be prisoner and guard. So on day one, we knew we had good apples. I'm going to put them in a bad situation.And secondly, we know there's no difference between the boys who will be guards and those who will be prisoners. To the prisoners, we said, \"Wait at home. The study will begin Sunday.\" We didn't tell them that the city police were going to come and do realistic arrests.(Video) (Music)[Day 1]Student: A police car pulls up in front, and a cop comes to the front door, and knocks, and says he's looking for me. So they, right there, you know, they took me out the door, they put my hands against the car. It was a real cop car, it was a real policeman, and there were real neighbors in the street, who didn't know that this was an experiment. And there was cameras all around and neighbors all around. They put me in the car, then they drove me around Palo Alto. They took me to the basement of the police station. Then they put me in a cell. I was the first one to be picked up, so they put me in a cell, which was just like a room with a door with bars on it. You could tell it wasn't a real jail. They locked me in there, in this degrading little outfit. They were taking this experiment too seriously.Here are the prisoners, who are going to be dehumanized, they'll become numbers. Here are the guards with the symbols of power and anonymity. Guards get prisoners to clean the toilet bowls out with their bare hands, to do other humiliating tasks. They strip them naked. They sexually taunt them. They begin to do degrading activities, like having them simulate sodomy. You saw simulating fellatio in soldiers in Abu Ghraib. My guards did it in five days. The stress reaction was so extreme that normal kids we picked because they were healthy had breakdowns within 36 hours. The study ended after six days, because it was out of control. Five kids had emotional breakdowns.Does it make a difference if warriors go to battle changing their appearance or not? If they're anonymous, how do they treat their victims? In some cultures, they go to war without changing their appearance. In others, they paint themselves like \"Lord of the Flies.\" In some, they wear masks. In many, soldiers are anonymous in uniform. So this anthropologist, John Watson, found 23 cultures that had two bits of data. Do they change their appearance? 15. Do they kill, torture, mutilate? 13. If they don't change their appearance, only one of eight kills, tortures or mutilates. The key is in the red zone. If they change their appearance, 12 of 13 \u2014 that's 90 percent \u2014 kill, torture, mutilate. And that's the power of anonymity.So what are the seven social processes that grease the slippery slope of evil? Mindlessly taking the first small step. Dehumanization of others. De-individuation of self. Diffusion of personal responsibility. Blind obedience to authority. Uncritical conformity to group norms. Passive tolerance of evil through inaction, or indifference.And it happens when you're in a new or unfamiliar situation. Your habitual response patterns don't work. Your personality and morality are disengaged. \"Nothing is easier than to denounce the evildoer; nothing more difficult than understanding him,\" Dostoyevsky. Understanding is not excusing. Psychology is not excuse-ology.So social and psychological research reveals how ordinary, good people can be transformed without the drugs. You don't need it. You just need the social-psychological processes. Real world parallels? Compare this with this. James Schlesinger \u2014 I'm going to end with this \u2014 says, \"Psychologists have attempted to understand how and why individuals and groups who usually act humanely can sometimes act otherwise in certain circumstances.\" That's the Lucifer effect. And he goes on to say, \"The landmark Stanford study provides a cautionary tale for all military operations.\" If you give people power without oversight, it's a prescription for abuse. They knew that, and let that happen.So another report, an investigative report by General Fay, says the system is guilty. In this report, he says it was the environment that created Abu Ghraib, by leadership failures that contributed to the occurrence of such abuse, and because it remained undiscovered by higher authorities for a long period of time. Those abuses went on for three months. Who was watching the store? The answer is nobody, I think on purpose. He gave the guards permission to do those things, and they knew nobody was ever going to come down to that dungeon.So you need a paradigm shift in all of these areas. The shift is away from the medical model that focuses only on the individual. The shift is toward a public health model that recognizes situational and systemic vectors of disease. Bullying is a disease. Prejudice is a disease. Violence is a disease. Since the Inquisition, we've been dealing with problems at the individual level. It doesn't work. Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn says, \"The line between good and evil cuts through the heart of every human being.\" That means that line is not out there. That's a decision that you have to make, a personal thing.So I want to end very quickly on a positive note. Heroism as the antidote to evil, by promoting the heroic imagination, especially in our kids, in our educational system. We want kids to think, \"I'm a hero in waiting, waiting for the right situation to come along, and I will act heroically. My whole life, I'm now going to focus away from evil \u2014 that I've been in since I was a kid \u2014 to understanding heroes.Banality of heroism. It's ordinary people who do heroic deeds. It's the counterpoint to Hannah Arendt's \"Banality of Evil.\" Our traditional societal heroes are wrong, because they are the exceptions. They organize their life around this. That's why we know their names. Our kids' heroes are also wrong models for them, because they have supernatural talents. We want our kids to realize most heroes are everyday people, and the heroic act is unusual. This is Joe Darby. He was the one that stopped those abuses you saw, because when he saw those images, he turned them over to a senior investigating officer. He was a low-level private, and that stopped it. Was he a hero? No. They had to put him in hiding, because people wanted to kill him, and then his mother and his wife. For three years, they were in hiding.This is the woman who stopped the Stanford Prison Study. When I said it got out of control, I was the prison superintendent. I didn't know it was out of control. I was totally indifferent. She saw that madhouse and said, \"You know what, it's terrible what you're doing to those boys. They're not prisoners nor guards, they're boys, and you are responsible.\" And I ended the study the next day. The good news is I married her the next year.(Laughter)(Applause)I just came to my senses, obviously.So situations have the power to do [three things]. But the point is, this is the same situation that can inflame the hostile imagination in some of us, that makes us perpetrators of evil, can inspire the heroic imagination in others. It's the same situation and you're on one side or the other. Most people are guilty of the evil of inaction, because your mother said, \"Don't get involved. Mind your own business.\" And you have to say, \"Mama, humanity is my business.\"So the psychology of heroism is \u2014 we're going to end in a moment \u2014 how do we encourage children in new hero courses, that I'm working on with Matt Langdon \u2014 he has a hero workshop \u2014 to develop this heroic imagination, this self-labeling, \"I am a hero in waiting,\" and teach them skills. To be a hero, you have to learn to be a deviant, because you're always going against the conformity of the group. Heroes are ordinary people whose social actions are extraordinary. Who act.The key to heroism is two things. You have to act when other people are passive. B: You have to act socio-centrically, not egocentrically. And I want to end with a known story about Wesley Autrey, New York subway hero. Fifty-year-old African-American construction worker standing on a subway. A white guy falls on the tracks. The subway train is coming. There's 75 people there. You know what? They freeze. He's got a reason not to get involved. He's black, the guy's white, and he's got two kids. Instead, he gives his kids to a stranger, jumps on the tracks, puts the guy between the tracks, lays on him, the subway goes over him. Wesley and the guy \u2014 20 and a half inches height. The train clearance is 21 inches. A half an inch would have taken his head off. And he said, \"I did what anyone could do,\" no big deal to jump on the tracks.And the moral imperative is \"I did what everyone should do.\" And so one day, you will be in a new situation. Take path one, you're going to be a perpetrator of evil. Evil, meaning you're going to be Arthur Andersen. You're going to cheat, or you're going to allow bullying. Path two, you become guilty of the evil of passive inaction. Path three, you become a hero. The point is, are we ready to take the path to celebrating ordinary heroes, waiting for the right situation to come along to put heroic imagination into action? Because it may only happen once in your life, and when you pass it by, you'll always know, I could have been a hero and I let it pass me by. So the point is thinking it and then doing it.So I want to thank you. Thank you. Let's oppose the power of evil systems at home and abroad, and let's focus on the positive. Advocate for respect of personal dignity, for justice and peace, which sadly our administration has not been doing.Thanks so much.(Applause)", "id": 272, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:12.592 --> 00:00:16.148\nPhilosophers, dramatists, theologians\n\n00:00:16.172 --> 00:00:18.378\nhave grappled with\nthis question for centuries:\n\n00:00:18.402 --> 00:00:19.934\nwhat makes people go wrong?\n\n00:00:19.958 --> 00:00:22.934\nInterestingly, I asked this question\nwhen I was a little kid.\n\n00:00:22.958 --> 00:00:26.014\nI grew up in the South Bronx,\ninner-city ghetto in New York,\n\n00:00:26.038 --> 00:00:27.521\nand I was surrounded by evil,\n\n00:00:27.545 --> 00:00:30.101\nas all kids are who grew up\nin an inner city.\n\n00:00:30.125 --> 00:00:32.450\nAnd I had friends\nwho were really good kids,\n\n00:00:32.474 --> 00:00:36.766\nwho lived out the Dr. Jekyll Mr. Hyde\nscenario -- Robert Louis Stevenson.\n\n00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:39.934\nThat is, they took drugs,\ngot in trouble, went to jail.\n\n00:00:39.958 --> 00:00:43.817\nSome got killed, and some did it\nwithout drug assistance.\n\n00:00:44.246 --> 00:00:47.040\nSo when I read Robert Louis Stevenson,\nthat wasn't fiction.\n\n00:00:47.064 --> 00:00:49.288\nThe only question is,\nwhat was in the juice?\n\n00:00:49.312 --> 00:00:52.934\nAnd more importantly, that line\nbetween good and evil --\n\n00:00:52.958 --> 00:00:56.426\nwhich privileged people like to think\nis fixed and impermeable,\n\n00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:59.123\nwith them on the good side,\nthe others on the bad side --\n\n00:00:59.147 --> 00:01:02.210\nI knew that line was movable,\nand it was permeable.\n\n00:01:02.234 --> 00:01:04.577\nGood people could be\nseduced across that line,\n\n00:01:04.601 --> 00:01:08.805\nand under good and some rare\ncircumstances, bad kids could recover\n\n00:01:08.829 --> 00:01:11.125\nwith help, with reform,\nwith rehabilitation.\n\n00:01:11.958 --> 00:01:14.435\nSo I want to begin\nwith this wonderful illusion\n\n00:01:14.459 --> 00:01:16.733\nby [Dutch] artist M.C. Escher.\n\n00:01:16.757 --> 00:01:20.618\nIf you look at it and focus on the white,\nwhat you see is a world full of angels.\n\n00:01:20.642 --> 00:01:23.210\nBut let's look more deeply, and as we do,\n\n00:01:23.234 --> 00:01:26.255\nwhat appears is the demons,\nthe devils in the world.\n\n00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:28.171\nThat tells us several things.\n\n00:01:28.195 --> 00:01:31.303\nOne, the world is, was, will always\nbe filled with good and evil,\n\n00:01:31.327 --> 00:01:34.375\nbecause good and evil is the yin and yang\nof the human condition.\n\n00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:35.685\nIt tells me something else.\n\n00:01:35.709 --> 00:01:38.737\nIf you remember,\nGod's favorite angel was Lucifer.\n\n00:01:39.247 --> 00:01:41.685\nApparently, Lucifer means \"the light.\"\n\n00:01:41.709 --> 00:01:44.435\nIt also means \"the morning star,\"\nin some scripture.\n\n00:01:44.459 --> 00:01:47.664\nAnd apparently, he disobeyed God,\n\n00:01:47.688 --> 00:01:50.180\nand that's the ultimate\ndisobedience to authority.\n\n00:01:50.204 --> 00:01:55.702\nAnd when he did, Michael, the archangel,\nwas sent to kick him out of heaven\n\n00:01:55.726 --> 00:01:57.729\nalong with the other fallen angels.\n\n00:01:57.753 --> 00:02:00.934\nAnd so Lucifer descends into hell,\nbecomes Satan,\n\n00:02:00.958 --> 00:02:03.958\nbecomes the devil, and the force\nof evil in the universe begins.\n\n00:02:03.982 --> 00:02:08.451\nParadoxically, it was God\nwho created hell as a place to store evil.\n\n00:02:08.934 --> 00:02:11.315\nHe didn't do a good job\nof keeping it there though.\n\n00:02:11.339 --> 00:02:15.928\nSo, this arc of the cosmic transformation\nof God's favorite angel into the Devil,\n\n00:02:15.952 --> 00:02:19.596\nfor me, sets the context\nfor understanding human beings\n\n00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:23.934\nwho are transformed from good,\nordinary people into perpetrators of evil.\n\n00:02:24.535 --> 00:02:28.562\nSo the Lucifer effect,\nalthough it focuses on the negatives --\n\n00:02:28.586 --> 00:02:31.241\nthe negatives that people can become,\n\n00:02:31.265 --> 00:02:33.227\nnot the negatives that people are --\n\n00:02:33.251 --> 00:02:36.605\nleads me to a psychological definition.\n\n00:02:36.629 --> 00:02:38.602\nEvil is the exercise of power.\n\n00:02:38.626 --> 00:02:40.865\nAnd that's the key: it's about power.\n\n00:02:40.889 --> 00:02:43.454\nTo intentionally harm\npeople psychologically,\n\n00:02:43.478 --> 00:02:47.208\nto hurt people physically,\nto destroy people mortally, or ideas,\n\n00:02:47.232 --> 00:02:49.426\nand to commit crimes against humanity.\n\n00:02:50.958 --> 00:02:54.244\nIf you Google \"evil,\" a word that should\nsurely have withered by now,\n\n00:02:54.268 --> 00:02:57.934\nyou come up with 136 million hits\nin a third of a second.\n\n00:02:57.958 --> 00:03:02.456\nA few years ago -- I am sure\nall of you were shocked, as I was,\n\n00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:07.934\nwith the revelation of American soldiers\nabusing prisoners in a strange place\n\n00:03:07.958 --> 00:03:10.934\nin a controversial war,\nAbu Ghraib in Iraq.\n\n00:03:10.958 --> 00:03:12.965\nAnd these were men and women\n\n00:03:12.989 --> 00:03:17.276\nwho were putting prisoners\nthrough unbelievable humiliation.\n\n00:03:17.934 --> 00:03:19.744\nI was shocked, but I wasn't surprised,\n\n00:03:19.768 --> 00:03:21.934\nbecause I had seen\nthose same visual parallels\n\n00:03:21.958 --> 00:03:25.360\nwhen I was the prison superintendent\nof the Stanford Prison Study.\n\n00:03:25.384 --> 00:03:28.099\nImmediately the Bush\nadministration military said what?\n\n00:03:28.479 --> 00:03:30.979\nWhat all administrations say\nwhen there's a scandal:\n\n00:03:31.003 --> 00:03:32.853\n\"Don't blame us. It's not the system.\n\n00:03:32.877 --> 00:03:35.277\nIt's the few bad apples,\nthe few rogue soldiers.\"\n\n00:03:35.301 --> 00:03:38.332\nMy hypothesis is,\nAmerican soldiers are good, usually.\n\n00:03:38.356 --> 00:03:40.417\nMaybe it was the barrel that was bad.\n\n00:03:40.441 --> 00:03:42.934\nBut how am I going to deal\nwith that hypothesis?\n\n00:03:42.958 --> 00:03:45.478\nI became an expert witness\nfor one of the guards,\n\n00:03:45.502 --> 00:03:47.645\nSergeant Chip Frederick,\nand in that position,\n\n00:03:47.669 --> 00:03:50.582\nI had access to the dozen\ninvestigative reports.\n\n00:03:50.606 --> 00:03:52.406\nI had access to him.\n\n00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:55.731\nI could study him, have him come\nto my home, get to know him,\n\n00:03:55.755 --> 00:03:59.162\ndo psychological analysis to see,\nwas he a good apple or bad apple.\n\n00:03:59.186 --> 00:04:03.097\nAnd thirdly, I had access\nto all of the 1,000 pictures\n\n00:04:03.121 --> 00:04:04.334\nthat these soldiers took.\n\n00:04:04.823 --> 00:04:07.333\nThese pictures are\nof a violent or sexual nature.\n\n00:04:07.357 --> 00:04:10.316\nAll of them come from the cameras\nof American soldiers.\n\n00:04:10.767 --> 00:04:13.626\nBecause everybody has\na digital camera or cell phone camera,\n\n00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:15.984\nthey took pictures of everything,\nmore than 1,000.\n\n00:04:16.008 --> 00:04:18.962\nAnd what I've done is I organized them\ninto various categories.\n\n00:04:18.986 --> 00:04:23.925\nBut these are by United States\nmilitary police, army reservists.\n\n00:04:24.435 --> 00:04:27.917\nThey are not soldiers prepared\nfor this mission at all.\n\n00:04:27.941 --> 00:04:31.614\nAnd it all happened in a single place,\nTier 1-A, on the night shift.\n\n00:04:31.638 --> 00:04:32.839\nWhy?\n\n00:04:32.863 --> 00:04:35.465\nTier 1-A was the center\nfor military intelligence.\n\n00:04:35.489 --> 00:04:37.465\nIt was the interrogation hold.\n\n00:04:37.489 --> 00:04:38.690\nThe CIA was there.\n\n00:04:38.714 --> 00:04:41.872\nInterrogators from\nTitan Corporation, all there,\n\n00:04:41.896 --> 00:04:44.682\nand they're getting no information\nabout the insurgency.\n\n00:04:44.706 --> 00:04:47.176\nSo they're going to put pressure\non these soldiers,\n\n00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:48.920\nmilitary police, to cross the line,\n\n00:04:48.944 --> 00:04:51.934\ngive them permission to break\nthe will of the enemy,\n\n00:04:51.958 --> 00:04:54.435\nto prepare them for interrogation,\nto soften them up,\n\n00:04:54.459 --> 00:04:55.685\nto take the gloves off.\n\n00:04:55.709 --> 00:04:58.837\nThose are the euphemisms,\nand this is how it was interpreted.\n\n00:04:59.592 --> 00:05:01.362\nLet's go down to that dungeon.\n\n00:05:03.243 --> 00:05:04.552\n(Typewriting)\n\n00:05:05.037 --> 00:05:10.585\n[Abu Ghraib Iraq Prison Abuses 2008\nMilitary Police Guards' Photos]\n\n00:05:11.046 --> 00:05:17.403\n[The

00:06:56.891\nAnd it should not have escaped you\n\n00:06:56.915 --> 00:07:00.152\nthat the reason I paired\nthe prisoner with his arms out\n\n00:07:00.176 --> 00:07:02.934\nwith Leonardo da Vinci's ode to humanity\n\n00:07:02.958 --> 00:07:05.540\nis that that prisoner was mentally ill.\n\n00:07:05.564 --> 00:07:07.917\nThat prisoner covered himself\nwith shit every day,\n\n00:07:07.941 --> 00:07:10.359\nthey had to roll him in dirt\nso he wouldn't stink.\n\n00:07:10.383 --> 00:07:12.731\nBut the guards ended up\ncalling him \"Shit Boy.\"\n\n00:07:12.755 --> 00:07:16.934\nWhat was he doing in that prison\nrather than in some mental institution?\n\n00:07:17.455 --> 00:07:20.170\nIn any event, here's former\nSecretary of Defense Rumsfeld.\n\n00:07:20.194 --> 00:07:23.004\nHe comes down and says,\n\"I want to know, who is responsible?\n\n00:07:23.028 --> 00:07:24.407\nWho are the bad apples?\"\n\n00:07:24.431 --> 00:07:25.839\nWell, that's a bad question.\n\n00:07:25.863 --> 00:07:28.484\nYou have to reframe it and ask,\n\"What is responsible?\"\n\n00:07:28.508 --> 00:07:30.156\n\"What\" could be the who of people,\n\n00:07:30.180 --> 00:07:32.717\nbut it could also be\nthe what of the situation,\n\n00:07:32.741 --> 00:07:34.427\nand obviously that's wrongheaded.\n\n00:07:34.451 --> 00:07:38.296\nHow do psychologists try to understand\nsuch transformations of human character,\n\n00:07:38.320 --> 00:07:40.320\nif you believe\nthat they were good soldiers\n\n00:07:40.344 --> 00:07:42.154\nbefore they went down to that dungeon?\n\n00:07:42.178 --> 00:07:45.040\nThere are three ways.\nThe main way is called dispositional.\n\n00:07:45.064 --> 00:07:47.934\nWe look at what's inside\nof the person, the bad apples.\n\n00:07:47.958 --> 00:07:51.269\nThis is the foundation\nof all of social science,\n\n00:07:51.293 --> 00:07:53.953\nthe foundation of religion,\nthe foundation of war.\n\n00:07:54.958 --> 00:07:57.197\nSocial psychologists like me\ncome along and say,\n\n00:07:57.221 --> 00:07:59.340\n\"Yeah, people are the actors on the stage,\n\n00:07:59.364 --> 00:08:01.714\nbut you'll have to be aware\nof the situation.\n\n00:08:01.738 --> 00:08:04.119\nWho are the cast of characters?\nWhat's the costume?\n\n00:08:04.143 --> 00:08:05.602\nIs there a stage director?\"\n\n00:08:05.626 --> 00:08:08.293\nAnd so we're interested in\nwhat are the external factors\n\n00:08:08.317 --> 00:08:10.293\naround the individual -- the bad barrel?\n\n00:08:10.862 --> 00:08:13.509\nSocial scientists stop there\nand they miss the big point\n\n00:08:13.533 --> 00:08:16.772\nthat I discovered when I became\nan expert witness for Abu Ghraib.\n\n00:08:16.796 --> 00:08:18.347\nThe power is in the system.\n\n00:08:18.371 --> 00:08:21.612\nThe system creates the situation\nthat corrupts the individuals,\n\n00:08:21.636 --> 00:08:26.420\nand the system is the legal, political,\neconomic, cultural background.\n\n00:08:26.444 --> 00:08:29.738\nAnd this is where the power\nis of the bad-barrel makers.\n\n00:08:30.097 --> 00:08:32.598\nIf you want to change a person,\nchange the situation.\n\n00:08:32.622 --> 00:08:36.011\nAnd to change it, you've got to know\nwhere the power is, in the system.\n\n00:08:36.035 --> 00:08:38.083\nSo the Lucifer effect\ninvolves understanding\n\n00:08:38.107 --> 00:08:42.562\nhuman character transformations\nwith these three factors.\n\n00:08:43.082 --> 00:08:44.471\nAnd it's a dynamic interplay.\n\n00:08:44.495 --> 00:08:46.561\nWhat do the people bring\ninto the situation?\n\n00:08:46.585 --> 00:08:48.593\nWhat does the situation bring out of them?\n\n00:08:48.617 --> 00:08:51.934\nAnd what is the system\nthat creates and maintains that situation?\n\n00:08:52.582 --> 00:08:54.866\nMy recent book,\n\"The Lucifer Effect,\" is about,\n\n00:08:54.890 --> 00:08:57.129\nhow do you understand\nhow good people turn evil?\n\n00:08:57.153 --> 00:09:00.416\nAnd it has a lot of detail\nabout what I'm going to talk about today.\n\n00:09:00.854 --> 00:09:03.934\nSo Dr. Z's \"Lucifer Effect,\"\nalthough it focuses on evil,\n\n00:09:03.958 --> 00:09:08.118\nreally is a celebration of the human\nmind's infinite capacity\n\n00:09:08.142 --> 00:09:10.700\nto make any of us kind or cruel,\n\n00:09:10.724 --> 00:09:13.246\ncaring or indifferent,\ncreative or destructive,\n\n00:09:13.270 --> 00:09:15.548\nand it makes some of us villains.\n\n00:09:15.572 --> 00:09:18.669\nAnd the good news that I'm going\nto hopefully come to at the end\n\n00:09:18.693 --> 00:09:20.460\nis that it makes some of us heroes.\n\n00:09:21.609 --> 00:09:25.158\nThis wonderful cartoon in the New Yorker\nsummarizes my whole talk:\n\n00:09:25.182 --> 00:09:27.325\n\"I'm neither a good cop\nnor a bad cop, Jerome.\n\n00:09:27.349 --> 00:09:29.308\nLike yourself, I'm a complex amalgam\n\n00:09:29.332 --> 00:09:31.801\nof positive and negative\npersonality traits\n\n00:09:31.825 --> 00:09:35.315\nthat emerge or not, depending\non the circumstances.\"\n\n00:09:35.339 --> 00:09:37.324\n(Laughter)\n\n00:09:37.348 --> 00:09:40.200\nThere's a study some of you\nthink you know about,\n\n00:09:40.224 --> 00:09:42.411\nbut very few people\nhave ever read the story.\n\n00:09:42.435 --> 00:09:44.360\nYou watched the movie.\n\n00:09:44.384 --> 00:09:47.733\nThis is Stanley Milgram,\nlittle Jewish kid from the Bronx,\n\n00:09:47.757 --> 00:09:50.856\nand he asked the question,\n\"Could the Holocaust happen here, now?\"\n\n00:09:50.880 --> 00:09:54.385\nPeople say, \"No, that's Nazi Germany,\nHitler, you know, that's 1939.\"\n\n00:09:54.409 --> 00:09:56.802\nHe said, \"Yeah, but suppose\nHitler asked you,\n\n00:09:56.826 --> 00:09:59.996\n'Would you electrocute a stranger?'\n'No way, I'm a good person.'\"\n\n00:10:00.020 --> 00:10:02.116\nHe

You just need\nthe social-psychological processes.\n\n00:17:20.789 --> 00:17:22.484\nReal world parallels?\n\n00:17:22.508 --> 00:17:24.692\nCompare this with this.\n\n00:17:25.934 --> 00:17:28.622\nJames Schlesinger --\nI'm going to end with this -- says,\n\n00:17:28.646 --> 00:17:31.245\n\"Psychologists have attempted\nto understand how and why\n\n00:17:31.269 --> 00:17:33.698\nindividuals and groups\nwho usually act humanely\n\n00:17:33.722 --> 00:17:36.910\ncan sometimes act otherwise\nin certain circumstances.\"\n\n00:17:36.934 --> 00:17:38.173\nThat's the Lucifer effect.\n\n00:17:38.197 --> 00:17:40.626\nAnd he goes on to say,\n\"The landmark Stanford study\n\n00:17:40.650 --> 00:17:44.570\nprovides a cautionary tale\nfor all military operations.\"\n\n00:17:44.594 --> 00:17:46.934\nIf you give people power\nwithout oversight,\n\n00:17:46.958 --> 00:17:48.441\nit's a prescription for abuse.\n\n00:17:48.465 --> 00:17:50.876\nThey knew that, and let that happen.\n\n00:17:51.635 --> 00:17:54.715\nSo another report, an investigative\nreport by General Fay,\n\n00:17:54.739 --> 00:17:56.689\nsays the system is guilty.\n\n00:17:56.713 --> 00:18:00.176\nIn this report, he says it was\nthe environment that created Abu Ghraib,\n\n00:18:00.200 --> 00:18:03.582\nby leadership failures that contributed\nto the occurrence of such abuse,\n\n00:18:03.606 --> 00:18:05.516\nand because it remained undiscovered\n\n00:18:05.540 --> 00:18:07.780\nby higher authorities\nfor a long period of time.\n\n00:18:07.804 --> 00:18:09.629\nThose abuses went on for three months.\n\n00:18:09.653 --> 00:18:11.261\nWho was watching the store?\n\n00:18:11.285 --> 00:18:13.532\nThe answer is nobody, I think on purpose.\n\n00:18:13.556 --> 00:18:15.849\nHe gave the guards permission\nto do those things,\n\n00:18:15.873 --> 00:18:18.937\nand they knew nobody was ever going\nto come down to that dungeon.\n\n00:18:18.961 --> 00:18:21.529\nSo you need a paradigm shift\nin all of these areas.\n\n00:18:21.553 --> 00:18:25.230\nThe shift is away from the medical model\nthat focuses only on the individual.\n\n00:18:25.254 --> 00:18:27.934\nThe shift is toward a public health model\n\n00:18:27.958 --> 00:18:31.740\nthat recognizes situational\nand systemic vectors of disease.\n\n00:18:31.764 --> 00:18:34.101\nBullying is a disease.\nPrejudice is a disease.\n\n00:18:34.125 --> 00:18:35.293\nViolence is a disease.\n\n00:18:35.317 --> 00:18:39.085\nSince the Inquisition, we've been dealing\nwith problems at the individual level.\n\n00:18:39.109 --> 00:18:40.550\nIt doesn't work.\n\n00:18:40.574 --> 00:18:43.390\nAleksandr Solzhenitsyn says,\n\"The line between good and evil\n\n00:18:43.414 --> 00:18:45.534\ncuts through the heart\nof every human being.\"\n\n00:18:45.558 --> 00:18:47.370\nThat means that line is not out there.\n\n00:18:47.394 --> 00:18:50.365\nThat's a decision that you have\nto make, a personal thing.\n\n00:18:50.389 --> 00:18:52.934\nSo I want to end very quickly\non a positive note.\n\n00:18:53.450 --> 00:18:55.910\nHeroism as the antidote to evil,\n\n00:18:55.934 --> 00:18:57.829\nby promoting the heroic imagination,\n\n00:18:57.853 --> 00:19:00.351\nespecially in our kids,\nin our educational system.\n\n00:19:00.375 --> 00:19:02.839\nWe want kids to think,\n\"I'm a hero in waiting,\n\n00:19:02.863 --> 00:19:05.006\nwaiting for the right\nsituation to come along,\n\n00:19:05.030 --> 00:19:06.573\nand I will act heroically.\n\n00:19:06.597 --> 00:19:09.275\nMy whole life, I'm now going\nto focus away from evil --\n\n00:19:09.299 --> 00:19:12.252\nthat I've been in since I was a kid\n-- to understanding heroes.\n\n00:19:12.276 --> 00:19:13.441\nBanality of heroism.\n\n00:19:13.465 --> 00:19:15.469\nIt's ordinary people who do heroic deeds.\n\n00:19:15.493 --> 00:19:18.439\nIt's the counterpoint\nto Hannah Arendt's \"Banality of Evil.\"\n\n00:19:18.463 --> 00:19:22.424\nOur traditional societal heroes are wrong,\nbecause they are the exceptions.\n\n00:19:22.448 --> 00:19:25.783\nThey organize their life around this.\nThat's why we know their names.\n\n00:19:25.807 --> 00:19:28.085\nOur kids' heroes\nare also wrong models for them,\n\n00:19:28.109 --> 00:19:30.053\nbecause they have supernatural talents.\n\n00:19:30.077 --> 00:19:33.038\nWe want our kids to realize\nmost heroes are everyday people,\n\n00:19:33.062 --> 00:19:35.166\nand the heroic act is unusual.\n\n00:19:35.190 --> 00:19:36.481\nThis is Joe Darby.\n\n00:19:36.505 --> 00:19:38.791\nHe was the one that stopped\nthose abuses you saw,\n\n00:19:38.815 --> 00:19:40.408\nbecause when he saw those images,\n\n00:19:40.432 --> 00:19:43.003\nhe turned them over\nto a senior investigating officer.\n\n00:19:43.027 --> 00:19:45.755\nHe was a low-level private,\nand that stopped it.\n\n00:19:45.779 --> 00:19:46.957\nWas he a hero? No.\n\n00:19:46.981 --> 00:19:50.131\nThey had to put him in hiding,\nbecause people wanted to kill him,\n\n00:19:50.155 --> 00:19:51.807\nand then his mother and his wife.\n\n00:19:51.831 --> 00:19:53.716\nFor three years, they were in hiding.\n\n00:19:53.740 --> 00:19:56.426\nThis is the woman who stopped\nthe Stanford Prison Study.\n\n00:19:56.450 --> 00:19:59.699\nWhen I said it got out of control,\nI was the prison superintendent.\n\n00:19:59.723 --> 00:20:02.722\nI didn't know it was out of control.\nI was totally indifferent.\n\n00:20:02.746 --> 00:20:04.337\nShe saw that madhouse and said,\n\n00:20:04.361 --> 00:20:07.266\n\"You know what, it's terrible\nwhat you're doing to those boys.\n\n00:20:07.290 --> 00:20:10.934\nThey're not prisoners nor guards,\nthey're boys, and you are responsible.\"\n\n00:20:10.958 --> 00:20:12.934\nAnd I ended the study the next day.\n\n00:20:13.497 --> 00:20:15.607\nThe good news\nis I married her the next year.\n\n00:20:15.631 --> 00:20:17.934\n(Laughter)\n\n00:20:17.958 --> 00:20:24.958\n(Applause)\n\n00:20:25.403 --> 00:20:27.414\nI just came to my senses, obviously.\n\n00:20:27.438 --> 00:20:30.107\nSo situations have the power\nto do [three things].\n\n00:20:30.131 --> 00:20:32.912\nBut the point is,\nthis is the same situation\n\n00:20:32.936 --> 00:20:36.402\nthat can inflame the hostile\nimagination in some of us,\n\n00:20:36.426 --> 00:20:38.163\nthat makes us perpetrators of evil,\n\n00:20:38.187 --> 00:20:40.380\ncan inspire the heroic\nimagination in others.\n\n00:20:40.404 --> 00:20:43.518\nIt's the same situation\nand you're on one side or the other.\n\n00:20:43.542 --> 00:20:45.733\nMost people are guilty\nof the evil of inaction,\n\n00:20:45.757 --> 00:20:49.105\nbecause your mother said, \"Don't get\ninvolved.

I'm here to talk to you about the importance of praise, admiration and thank you, and having it be specific and genuine.And the way I got interested in this was, I noticed in myself, when I was growing up, and until about a few years ago, that I would want to say thank you to someone, I would want to praise them, I would want to take in their praise of me and I'd just stop it. And I asked myself, why? I felt shy, I felt embarrassed. And then my question became, am I the only one who does this? So, I decided to investigate.I'm fortunate enough to work in the rehab facility, so I get to see people who are facing life and death with addiction. And sometimes it comes down to something as simple as, their core wound is their father died without ever saying he's proud of them. But then, they hear from all the family and friends that the father told everybody else that he was proud of him, but he never told the son. It's because he didn't know that his son needed to hear it.So my question is, why don't we ask for the things that we need? I know a gentleman, married for 25 years, who's longing to hear his wife say, \"Thank you for being the breadwinner, so I can stay home with the kids,\" but won't ask. I know a woman who's good at this. She, once a week, meets with her husband and says, \"I'd really like you to thank me for all these things I did in the house and with the kids.\" And he goes, \"Oh, this is great, this is great.\" And praise really does have to be genuine, but she takes responsibility for that. And a friend of mine, April, who I've had since kindergarten, she thanks her children for doing their chores. And she said, \"Why wouldn't I thank it, even though they're supposed to do it?\"So, the question is, why was I blocking it? Why were other people blocking it? Why can I say, \"I'll take my steak medium rare, I need size six shoes,\" but I won't say, \"Would you praise me this way?\" And it's because I'm giving you critical data about me. I'm telling you where I'm insecure. I'm telling you where I need your help. And I'm treating you, my inner circle, like you're the enemy. Because what can you do with that data? You could neglect me. You could abuse it. Or you could actually meet my need.And I took my bike into the bike store\u2014 I love this \u2014 same bike, and they'd do something called \"truing\" the wheels. The guy said, \"You know, when you true the wheels, it's going to make the bike so much better.\" I get the same bike back, and they've taken all the little warps out of those same wheels I've had for two and a half years, and my bike is like new. So, I'm going to challenge all of you. I want you to true your wheels: be honest about the praise that you need to hear. What do you need to hear? Go home to your wife \u2014 go ask her, what does she need? Go home to your husband \u2014 what does he need? Go home and ask those questions, and then help the people around you.And it's simple. And why should we care about this? We talk about world peace. How can we have world peace with different cultures, different languages? I think it starts household by household, under the same roof. So, let's make it right in our own backyard. And I want to thank all of you in the audience for being great husbands, great mothers, friends, daughters, sons. And maybe somebody's never said that to you, but you've done a really, really good job. And thank you for being here, just showing up and changing the world with your ideas.Thank you.

And before I was a toy designer, oh, I was a mime, a street mime, actually. And then I was an entertainer, I guess. And before that, I was a silversmith, and before that, I was \u2014 I was out of the house at about 15 and a half, and I never wound up going into college. I didn't really \u2014 I didn't see the point at the time. I do now, after learning about all the quantum stuff.(Laughter) It's really cool.Anyway, I wanted to show you a little bit about the world of toy design, at least from my small aperture of the world. This is a video I made when I first started doing toy design. I'm in my garage, making weird stuff. And then you go to these toy companies and there's some guy across the table, and he goes, \"Pass. Pass. Pass.\" You know, you think it's so cool, but they \u2014 anyway, I made this little tape that I'd always show when I go in. This is the name of my company, Giving Toys. So I used to work at Mattel, actually. And after I left Mattel, I started all these hamburger makers, and then got the license to make the maker. So this is a hamburger maker that you take the peanut butter and stuff and you put it in there, and it makes \u2014 and this is a French fry maker, little, tiny food you can eat. I beat up the pasta maker to make that. Then this is a McNugget maker, I think. This, now that's the McNugget maker, and this is a \u2014 this is my oldest daughter making a McApple Pie. And let's see, you can make the pie and cinnamon and sugar, and then you eat, and you eat, and you eat, and you \u2014 she's about 300 pounds now. No, she's not, she's beautiful. This is how they looked when they came out at the end. These are a \u2014 this is like a 15 million dollar line. And it got me through some \u2014 I didn't make any royalties on this, but it got me through.Next is a compilation of a bunch of stuff. That was a missile foam launcher that didn't get sold. This is a squishy head, for no apparent reason. This is some effects that I did for \"Wig, Rattle and Roll.\" That was a robot eye thing controlling it in the back. That paid the rent for about a month. This is a walking Barbie \u2014 I said, \"Oh, this is it!\" And they go, \"Oh, that's really nice,\" and out it goes. So this is some fighting robots. I thought everyone would want these. They fight, they get back up, you know? Wouldn't this be cool? And they made it into a toy, and then they dropped it like a hot rock. They're pretty cool. This is a\u2014 we're doing some flight-testing on my little pug, seeing if this can really grab. It does pretty good. I'm using little phone connectors to make them so they can spin. It's how they, see, have those album things \u2014 kids don't know what they are. This is a clay maker. You know, I said \u2014 I went to Play-Doh, and said, \"Look, I can animate this.\" They said, \"Don't talk to us about Play-Doh.\" And then, I made a Lego animator. I thought, this would be so great! And you know, Lego \u2014 don't take Legos to Lego. That's the answer. They know everything about it.Then I started doing animatronics. I loved dinosaurs. I used to be in the film business, kind of, and actually, Nicholas Negroponte saw this when I was, like, 12, and anyway, so then they said, \"No, you have to make two and they have to fight.\" You know, how \u2014 why would a kid want a dinosaur? This is me using [unclear] or 3-D Studio, back in the '80s. That's David Letterman. You can see how old this stuff is. That's my youngest cousin. This is a segment called, \"Dangerous Toys You Won't See at Christmas.\" We had my first saw blade launcher and we had a flamethrower chair. My career basically peaked here. And in the back are foam-core cutouts of the people who couldn't make it to the show. This is MEK going through a windshield wiper motor. So this is a \u2014 I used to kind of be an actor. And I'm really not very good at it. But the \u2014 this is a guy named Dr. Yatz, who would take toys apart and show kids about engineering. And you can see the massively parallel processing Nintendos there. And over to the left is a view master of the CD-ROM. And a guy named Stan Reznikov did this as a pilot. This is a \u2014 you can see the little window there. You can actually see the Steadicam with a bubble on the bottom. You see the keyboard strapped to my wrist. Way ahead of my time here.(Video) I'm getting dizzy ... Narrator: I love toys!Caleb Chung: That's all I wanted to say there. I love toys. OK, so, so that was a, that was the first kind of a \u2014 that was the first batch of products. Most of them did not go. You get one out of 20, one out of 30 products. And every now and then, we do something like a, you know, an automated hair wrap machine, you know, that tangles your hair and pulls your scalp out, and \u2014 and we'd make some money on that, you know. And we'd give it out. But eventually, we left L.A., and we moved to Idaho, where there was actually a lot of peace and quiet. And I started working on this project \u2014 oh, I have to tell you about this real quick. Throughout this whole thing, making toys, I think there is a real correlation with innovation and art and science. There's some kind of a blend that happens that allows, you know, to find innovation. And I tried to sum this up in some kind of symbol that means something, to me anyway. And so, art and science have a kind of dynamic balance, that's where I think innovation happens. And actually, this is, to me, how I can come up with great ideas. But it's not how you actually get leverage. Actually, you have to put a circle around that, and call it business. And those three together, I think, give you leverage in the world. But moving on. So, this is a quick tale I'm going to tell. This is the Furby tale. As he said, I was co-inventor of the Furby. I did the body and creature \u2014 well, you'll see. So by way of showing you this, you can kind of get an understanding of what it is to, hopefully, try to create robotic life forms, or technology that has an emotional connection with the user. So this is my family. This is my wife, Christi, and Abby, and Melissa, and my 17-year-old now, Emily, who was just a pack of trouble. All right, there's that robot again. I came out of the movie business, as I said, and I said, let's make these animatronic robots. Let's make these things. And so I've always had a big interest in this. This one actually didn't go anywhere, but I got my feet wet doing this. This is a smaller one, and I have a little moving torso on there. A little, tiny guy walks along. More servo drives, lots of servo hacking, lots of mechanical stuff. There's another one. He actually has skeletor legs, I think, he's wearing there. Oh, this is a little pony, little pony \u2014 very cute little thing.The point of showing these is I've always been interested in little artificial life pieces. So the challenge was \u2014 I worked for Microsoft for a little bit, working on the Microsoft Barney. And this is a \u2014 you know, the purple dinosaur with kind of bloat wear. And, you know, they had lots, just lots of stuff in there that you didn't need, I thought. And then Microsoft can just fill a, you know, a warehouse full of this stuff and see if they sell. So it's a really strange business model compared to coming from a toy company. But anyway, a friend of mine and I, Dave Hampton, decided to see if we could do like a single-cell organism. What's the fewest pieces we could use to make a little life form? And that's our little, thirty-cent Mabuchi motor. And so, I have all these design books, like I'm sure many of you have. And throughout the books \u2014 this is the first page on Furby \u2014 I have kind of the art and science. I have the why over here, and the how over there. I try to do a lot of philosophy, a lot of thinking about all of these projects. Because they're not just \"bing\" ideas; you have to really dig deep in these things. So there's some real pseudo-code over here, and getting the idea of different kind of drives, things like that. And originally, Furby only had two eyes and some batteries on the bottom. And then we said, well, you're going to feed him, and he needs to talk, and it got more complicated. And then I had to figure out how I'm going to use that one motor to make the eyes move, and the ears move, and the body to move, and the mouth to move. And, you know, I want to make it blink and do all that at the same time. Well, I came up with this kind of linear expression thing with these cams and feedback. And that worked pretty well. Then I started to get a little more realistic and I have to start drawing the stuff. And there's my \"note to self\" at the top: \"lots of engineering.\" So that turned out to be a little more than true. There's my first exploded view and all the little pieces and the little worm drive and all that stuff. And then I've got to start building it, so this is the real thing. I get up and start cutting my finger and gluing things together. And that's my little workshop. And there's the first little cam that drove Furby. And there's Furby on the half shell. You can see the little BB in the box is my tilt sensor. I just basically gnawed all this stuff out of plastic. So there's the back of his head with a billion holes in it. And there I am. I'm done. There's my little Furby. No, it's a little robot on heroin or something, I think. (Laughter) So right now, you see, I love little robots. So my wife says, \"Well, you may like it, but nobody else will.\" So she comes to the rescue. This is my wife Christi, who is just, you know, my muse and my partner for eternity here. And she does drawings, right? She's an actual, you know, artist. And she starts doing all these different drawings and does color patterns and coloring books. And I like the guy with the cigar at the bottom there. He didn't test so well, but I like him. And then she started doing these other images. At that time, Beanie Babies was a big hit, and we thought, we'll do a bunch of different ones. So here's a little pink one, a little pouf on his head. And here's \u2014 this didn't do so well in testing either, I don't know why. There's my favorite, Demon Furby. That was a good one. Anyway, finally settled on kind of this kind of a look, little poufy body, a little imaginary character. And there he is, a little bush baby on \u2014 caught in the headlights there. I actually went to Toys\"R\"Us, got a little furry cat, ripped it apart and made this. And since then, every time I come home from Toys\"R\"Us with dolls or something, they disappear from my desk and they get hidden in the house. I have three girls and they just, they \u2014 it's like a rescue animal thing they're going there. (Laughter) So, a little tether coming off, it's just a control for the Fur's mouth and his eyes. It's just a little server control and I made a little video going: \"Hi, my name's Furby, and I'm good,\" you know, and then I'd reach my hand. He'd \u2014 you can tickle him. When I put my hand up, \"Ha, ha, ha, ha\" and that's how we sold him. And Hasbro actually said, I meant Tiger Electronics at the time, said, \"Yeah, we want to do this. We have, you know, 13 weeks or something to Toy Fair, and we're going to hire you guys to do this.\"And so Dave and I got working. Mostly me, because it was all mechanics at this point. So now I have to really figure out all kinds of stuff I don't know how to do. And I started working with Solid Works and a whole other group to do that. And we started \u2014 this was way back before there was really much SLA going on, not a lot of rapid prototyping. We certainly didn't have the money to do this. They only paid me, like, a little bit of money to do this, so I had to call a friend of a friend who was running the GM prototype plant, SLA plant, that was down. And they said, \"Yeah, well, we'll run them.\" So they ran all the shells for us, which was nice of them. And the cams I got cut at Hewlett Packard. We snuck in on the weekend. And so we just had a disc of the files. But they have a closed system, so you couldn't print the things out on the machine. So we actually printed them out on clear and taped them on the monitors. And on the weekend we ran the parts for that. So this is how they come out close to the end. And then they looked like little Garfields there. Eight months later \u2014 you may remember this, this was a \u2014 total, total, total chaos. For a while, they were making two million Furbys a month. They actually wound up doing about 40 million Furbys. I \u2014 it's unbelievable how \u2014 I don't know how that can be. And Hasbro made about, you know, a billion and a half dollars. And I just a little bit on each one.So full circle \u2014 why do I do this? Why do you, you know, try to do this stuff? And it's, of course, for your kids. And there's my youngest daughter with her Furbys. And she still actually has those. So I kind of retired, and we're already living in paradise up in Boise, on a river, you know. So and then I started another company called Toy Innovation and we did some projects with Mattel with actually with a lady who's here, Ivy Ross, and we did Miracle Moves Baby, made it in Wired magazine, did a bunch of other stuff. And then I started another company. We did a little hand-held device for teens that could hook up to the Internet, won \"Best Innovations\" at CES, but really I kind of slowed down and said, OK, I just ... After a while, I had this old tape of this dinosaur, and I gave it to this guy, and this other guy saw it, and then people started to want to do it. And they said they'd spend all this time. So I said, \"OK, let's try to do this dinosaur project.\" The crazy idea is we're going to try to clone a dinosaur as much as we can with today's technology. And it's not really \u2014 but as close as we can do. And we're going to try to really pull this off, intentfully try to make something that seems like it's alive. Not a robot that kind of does, but let's really go for it. So I picked a Camarasaurus, because the Camarasaurus was the most abundant of the sauropods in North America. And you could actually find full fossil evidence of these. That's a juvenile. And so we actually went in. There's a book called \"Walking on Eggshells,\" where they found actual sauropod skin in Patagonia. And the picture from the book, so when I \u2014 I told the sculptor to use this bump pattern, whatever you can to copy that. Very, very obsessive. There's a kind of truncated Camarasaurus skeleton, but the geometry's correct. And then I went in, and measured all the geometry because I figured, hey, biomimicry. If I do it kind of right, it might move kind of like the real thing. So there's the motor. And about this time, you know, all these other people are starting to help. Here's an example of what we did with the skull. There's the skull, there's my drawing of a skull. There's kind of the skin version of the soft tissue. There's the mechanism that would go in there, kind of a Geneva drive. There's some Solid Works versions of it. Here's some SLA parts of the same thing. And then, these are really crude pieces. We were just doing some tests here. There's the skull, pretty much the same shape as the Camarasaurus. There's a photorealistic eye behind a lens. And there's kind of the first exploded view, or see-through view. There's the first SLA version, and it already kind of has the feel, it has kind of a cuteness already. And the thing about blending science and art in this multidisciplinary stuff is you can do a robot, and then you go back and do the shape, and then you go back and forth. The servos in the front legs, we had to shape those like muscles. They had to fit within the envelope. There was a tremendous amount of work to get all that working right. All the neck and the tail are cable, so it moves smoothly and organically. And then, of course, you're not done yet. You have to get the look for the skin. The skin's a whole another thing, probably the hardest part. So you hire artists, and you try to get the look and feel of the character. Now, this is not \u2014 we're character designers, right? And we're still trying to keep with the real character. So, now you go back and you cover the whole thing with clay. Now you start doing the sculpture for this. And you can see we got a guy from \u2014 who's just a fanatic about dinosaurs to do the sculpting for us, down to the spoon-shaped teeth and everything. And then more sculpting, and then more sculpting, and then more sculpting, and then more sculpting. And then, four years and 10 million dollars later, we have a little Pleo. John, do you want to bring him up?John Sosoka is our CTO, and is really the man that's done most of the work with our 40-person company. I'd like to give John a hand. He never gets recognition. This is John Sosoka. (Applause) So, thank you, John, thank you, and get back to work, all right, man? All right \u2014 (Laughter) \u2014 no, it's very painful, so \u2014 (Laughter) \u2014 these are little Pleos and you can probably see them. This \u2014 I on purpose \u2014 they go through life stages. So when you first get them, they're babies. And you \u2014 more you have them, kind of the older they get, and they kind of learn through their behavior. So this one, this one's actually asleep, and \u2014 hang on. Pleo, wake up. Pleo, come on. So this guy's listening to my voice here. But they have 40 sensors all over their body. They have seven processors, they have 14 motors, they have \u2014 but you don't care, do you? They're just cute, right? That's the idea, that's the idea. So you see \u2014 hey, come on. Hey, did you feel that? There's something big and loud over here. Hey. (Laughter) That's good, wake up, wake up, wake up. Yeah, they're like kids, you know. You, yeah, yeah. Okay, he's hungry. I'll show you what he's been doing for, for four years. Here, here, here. Have some money, Pleo. (Laughter) There you go. That's what the investors think, that it's just \u2014 (Laughter) \u2014 right, right. So they're really sweet little guys. And we're hoping that \u2014 you know, our belief is that humans need to feel empathy towards things in order to be more human. And we think we can help that out by having little creatures that you can love. Now these are not robots, they're kind of lovebots, you know. They do change over time. But mostly they evoke a feeling of caring. And we have a \u2014 I have a little something here. Now I do want to say that, you know, Ugobe is not there yet. We've just opened the door, and it's for all of you to step through it. We did include some things that are hopefully useful. Excuse me, Pleo. They \u2014 he has a USB and he has a SD card, so it's completely open architecture. So anyone can plug him \u2014 (Applause) \u2014 thank you. This is John over here. Anyone can take Pleo and they can totally redo his personality. You can make him bipolar, or as someone said, a \u2014 (Laughter) \u2014 you can change his homeostatic drives, or whatever you want to call them. Kids can just drag and drop, put in new sounds. We \u2014 actually, it's very hard to keep people from doing this. We have one animator who's taken it and he's done a take on the Budweiser beer commercial, and they're going, \"Whassup,\" you know? (Laughter) You \u2014 so it's \u2014 yes, he likes that. So they're a handful. We hope you get one. I don't know what I'm missing to say, but as a last thing, I'd like to say is that if we continue along this path, we are designing our children's best friends. And there's a lot of social responsibility in that. That's why Pleo's soft and gentle and loving. And so I just \u2014 I hope we all dream well. Thank you.

Pass.\"\n\n00:01:01.958 --> 00:01:03.958\nYou know, you think it's so cool, but they --\n\n00:01:03.958 --> 00:01:06.958\nanyway, I made this little tape that I'd always show when I go in.\n\n00:01:06.958 --> 00:01:11.958\nThis is the name of my company, Giving Toys.\n\n00:01:11.958 --> 00:01:13.958\nSo I used to work at Mattel, actually.\n\n00:01:13.958 --> 00:01:17.958\nAnd after I left Mattel, I started all these hamburger makers,\n\n00:01:17.958 --> 00:01:19.958\nand then got the license to make the maker.\n\n00:01:19.958 --> 00:01:21.958\nSo this is a hamburger maker that\n\n00:01:21.958 --> 00:01:25.958\nyou take the peanut butter and stuff and you put it in there, and it makes --\n\n00:01:25.958 --> 00:01:28.958\nand this is a French fry maker, little, tiny food you can eat.\n\n00:01:28.958 --> 00:01:31.958\nI beat up the pasta maker to make that.\n\n00:01:31.958 --> 00:01:34.958\nThen this is a McNugget maker, I think.\n\n00:01:34.958 --> 00:01:38.958\nThis, now that's the McNugget maker,\n\n00:01:38.958 --> 00:01:44.958\nand this is a -- this is my oldest daughter making a McApple Pie.\n\n00:01:44.958 --> 00:01:47.958\nAnd let's see, you can make the pie and cinnamon and sugar,\n\n00:01:47.958 --> 00:01:52.958\nand then you eat, and you eat, and you eat, and you --\n\n00:01:52.958 --> 00:01:53.958\nshe's about 300 pounds now.\n\n00:01:53.958 --> 00:01:56.958\nNo, she's not, she's beautiful.\n\n00:01:56.958 --> 00:01:58.958\nThis is how they looked when they came out at the end.\n\n00:01:58.958 --> 00:02:00.958\nThese are a -- this is like a 15 million dollar line.\n\n00:02:00.958 --> 00:02:04.958\nAnd it got me through some -- I didn't make any royalties on this, but it got me through.\n\n00:02:04.958 --> 00:02:06.958\nNext is a compilation of a bunch of stuff.\n\n00:02:06.958 --> 00:02:08.958\nThat was a missile foam launcher that didn't get sold.\n\n00:02:08.958 --> 00:02:11.958\nThis is a squishy head, for no apparent reason.\n\n00:02:11.958 --> 00:02:16.958\nThis is some effects that I did for \"Wig, Rattle and Roll.\"\n\n00:02:16.958 --> 00:02:19.958\nThat was a robot eye thing controlling it in the back.\n\n00:02:19.958 --> 00:02:20.958\nThat paid the rent for about a month.\n\n00:02:20.958 --> 00:02:22.958\nThis is a walking Barbie -- I said, \"Oh, this is it!\"\n\n00:02:22.958 --> 00:02:24.958\nAnd they go, \"Oh, that's really nice,\" and out it goes.\n\n00:02:24.958 --> 00:02:28.958\nSo this is some fighting robots. I thought everyone would want these.\n\n00:02:28.958 --> 00:02:31.958\nThey fight, they get back up, you know? Wouldn't this be cool?\n\n00:02:31.958 --> 00:02:34.958\nAnd they made it into a toy, and then they dropped it like a hot rock.\n\n00:02:34.958 --> 00:02:36.958\nThey're pretty cool.\n\n00:02:36.958 --> 00:02:38.958\nThis is a-- we're doing some flight-testing\n\n00:02:38.958 --> 00:02:41.958\non my little pug, seeing if this can really grab.\n\n00:02:41.958 --> 00:02:44.958\nIt does pretty good.\n\n00:02:44.958 --> 00:02:47.958\nI'm using little phone connectors to make them so they can spin.\n\n00:02:47.958 --> 00:02:51.958\nIt's how they, see, have those album things -- kids don't know what they are.\n\n00:02:51.958 --> 00:02:52.958\nThis is a clay maker.\n\n00:02:52.958 --> 00:02:54.958\nYou know, I said -- I went to Play-Doh,\n\n00:02:54.958 --> 00:02:56.958\nand said, \"Look, I can animate this.\"\n\n00:02:56.958 --> 00:02:58.958\nThey said, \"Don't talk to us about Play-Doh.\"\n\n00:02:58.958 --> 00:02:59.958\nAnd then, I made a Lego animator.\n\n00:02:59.958 --> 00:03:01.958\nI thought, this would be so great!\n\n00:03:01.958 --> 00:03:04.958\nAnd you know, Lego -- don't take Legos to Lego.\n\n00:03:04.958 --> 00:03:07.958\nThat's the answer. They know everything about it.\n\n00:03:07.958 --> 00:03:08.958\nThen I started doing animatronics.\n\n00:03:08.958 --> 00:03:09.958\nI loved dinosaurs.\n\n00:03:09.958 --> 00:03:11.958\nI used to be in the film business, kind of,\n\n00:03:11.958 --> 00:03:15.958\nand actually, Nicholas Negroponte saw this when I was, like, 12,\n\n00:03:15.958 --> 00:03:18.958\nand anyway, so then they said, \"No, you have to make two and they have to fight.\"\n\n00:03:18.958 --> 00:03:21.958\nYou know, how -- why would a kid want a dinosaur?\n\n00:03:21.958 --> 00:03:27.958\nThis is me using [unclear] or 3-D Studio, back in the '80s.\n\n00:03:27.958 --> 00:03:28.958\nThat's David Letterman.\n\n00:03:28.958 --> 00:03:30.958\nYou can see how old this stuff is.\n\n00:03:30.958 --> 00:03:34.958\nThat's my youngest cousin.\n\n00:03:34.958 --> 00:03:38.958\nThis is a segment called, \"Dangerous Toys You Won't See at Christmas.\"\n\n00:03:38.958 --> 00:03:42.958\nWe had my first saw blade launcher and we had a flamethrower chair.\n\n00:03:42.958 --> 00:03:44.958\nMy career basically peaked here.\n\n00:03:44.958 --> 00:03:50.958\nAnd in the back are foam-core cutouts of the people who couldn't make it to the show.\n\n00:03:50.958 --> 00:03:58.958\nThis is MEK going through a windshield wiper motor.\n\n00:03:58.958 --> 00:04:02.958\nSo this is a -- I used to kind of be an actor.\n\n00:04:02.958 --> 00:04:04.958\nAnd I'm really not very good at it.\n\n00:04:04.958 --> 00:04:06.958\nBut the -- this is a guy named Dr. Yatz,\n\n00:04:06.958 --> 00:04:11.958\nwho would take toys apart and show kids about engineering.\n\n00:04:11.958 --> 00:04:14.958\nAnd you can see the massively parallel processing Nintendos there.\n\n00:04:14.958 --> 00:04:16.958\nAnd over to the left is a view master of the CD-ROM.\n\n00:04:16.958 --> 00:04:19.958\nAnd a guy named Stan Reznikov did this as a pilot.\n\n00:04:19.958 --> 00:04:22.958\nThis is a -- you can see the little window there.\n\n00:04:22.958 --> 00:04:27.958\nYou can actually see the Steadicam with a bubble on the bottom.\n\n00:04:27.958 --> 00:04:28.958\nYou see the keyboard strapped to my wrist.\n\n00:04:28.958 --> 00:04:30.958\nWay ahead of my time here.\n\n00:04:30.958 --> 00:04:40.958\n(Video) I'm getting dizzy ...\n\n00:04:40.958 --> 00:04:49.958\nNarrator: I love toys!\n\n00:04:49.958 --> 00:04:51.958\nCaleb Chung: That's all I wanted to say there. I love toys.\n\n00:04:51.958 --> 00:04:56.958\nOK, so, so that was a, that was the first kind of a --\n\n00:04:56.958 --> 00:04:58.958\nthat was the first batch of products.\n\n00:04:58.958 --> 00:04:59.958\nMost of them did not go.\n\n00:04:59.958 --> 00:05:02.958\nYou get one out of 20, one out of 30 products.\n\n00:05:02.958 --> 00:05:03.958\nAnd every now and then, we do something like a,\n\n00:05:03.958 --> 00:05:07.958\nyou know, an automated hair wrap machine, you know,\n\n00:05:07.958 --> 00:05:09.958\nthat tangles your hair and pulls your scalp out, and --\n\n00:05:09.958 --> 00:05:12.958\nand we'd make some money on that, you know. And we'd give it out.\n\n00:05:12.958 --> 00:05:18.958\nBut eventually, we left L.A., and we moved to Idaho,\n\n00:05:18.958 --> 00:05:20.958\nwhere there was actually a lot of peace and quiet.\n\n00:05:20.958 --> 00:05:22.958\nAnd I started working on this project\n\n00:05:22.958 --> 00:05:24.958\n-- oh, I have to tell you about this real quick.\n\n00:05:24.958 --> 00:05:27.958\nThroughout this whole thing, making toys,\n\n00:05:27.958 --> 00:05:30.958\nI think there is a real correlation with innovation and art and science.\n\n00:05:30.958 --> 00:05:32.958\nThere's some kind of a blend that happens\n\n00:05:32.958 --> 00:05:35.958\nthat allows, you know, to find innovation.\n\n00:05:35.958 --> 00:05:38.958\nAnd I tried to sum this up in some kind of symbol\n\n00:05:38.958 --> 00:05:40.958\nthat means something, to me anyway.\n\n00:05:40.958 --> 00:05:43.958\nAnd so, art and science have a kind of dynamic balance,\n\n00:05:43.958 --> 00:05:45.958\nthat's where I think innovation happens.\n\n00:05:45.958 --> 00:05:50.958\nAnd actually, this is, to me, how I can come up with great ideas.\n\n00:05:50.958 --> 00:05:52.958\nBut it's not how you actually get leverage.\n\n00:05:52.958 --> 00:05:54.958\nActually, you have to put a circle around that, and call it business.\n\n00:05:54.958 --> 00:05:57.958\nAnd those three together, I think, give you leverage in the world.\n\n00:05:57.958 --> 00:05:58.958\nBut moving on.\n\n00:05:58.958 --> 00:06:02.958\nSo, this is a quick tale I'm going to tell. This is the Furby tale.\n\n00:06:02.958 --> 00:06:04.958\nAs he said, I was co-inventor of the Furby.\n\n00:06:04.958 --> 00:06:07.958\nI did the body and creature -- well, you'll see.\n\n00:06:07.958 --> 00:06:09.958\nSo by way of showing you this, you can kind of\n\n00:06:09.958 --> 00:06:12.958\nget an understanding of what it is to,\n\n00:06:12.958 --> 00:06:18.958\nhopefully, try to create robotic life forms, or technology\n\n00:06:18.958 --> 00:06:22.958\nthat has an emotional connection with the user.\n\n00:06:22.958 --> 00:06:23.958\nSo this is my family.\n\n00:06:23.958 --> 00:06:26.958\nThis is my wife, Christi, and Abby, and Melissa,\n\n00:06:26.958 --> 00:06:30.958\nand my 17-year-old now, Emily, who was just a pack of trouble.\n\n00:06:30.958 --> 00:06:32.958\nAll right, there's that robot again.\n\n00:06:32.958 --> 00:06:34.958\nI came out of the movie business, as I said,\n\n00:06:34.958 --> 00:06:36.958\nand I said, let's make these animatronic robots.\n\n00:06:36.958 --> 00:06:38.958\nLet's make these things.\n\n00:06:38.958 --> 00:06:40.958\nAnd so I've always had a big interest in this.\n\n00:06:40.958 --> 00:06:41.958\nThis one actually didn't go anywhere,\n\n00:06:41.958 --> 00:06:43.958\nbut I got my feet wet doing this.\n\n00:06:43.958 --> 00:06:46.958\nThis is a smaller one, and I have a little moving torso on there.\n\n00:06:46.958 --> 00:06:49.958\nA little, tiny guy walks along. More servo drives,\n\n00:06:49.958 --> 00:06:51.958\nlots of servo hacking, lots of mechanical stuff.\n\n00:06:51.958 --> 00:06:52.958\nThere's another one.\n\n00:06:52.958 --> 00:06:55.958\nHe actually has skeletor legs, I think, he's wearing there.\n\n00:06:55.958 --> 00:06:57.958\nOh, this is a little pony, little pony -- very cute little thing.\n\n00:06:57.958 --> 00:07:02.958\nThe point of showing these is I've always been interested in little artificial life pieces.\n\n00:07:02.958 --> 00:07:06.958\nSo the challenge was -- I worked for Microsoft for a little bit,\n\n00:07:06.958 --> 00:07:07.958\nworking on the Microsoft Barney.\n\n00:07:07.958 --> 00:07:12.958\nAnd this is a -- you know, the purple dinosaur with kind of bloat wear.\n\n00:07:12.958 --> 00:07:16.958\nAnd, you know, they had lots, just lots of stuff in there that you didn't need, I thought.\n\n00:07:16.958 --> 00:07:19.958\nAnd then Microsoft can just fill a, you know, a warehouse\n\n00:07:19.958 --> 00:07:21.958\nfull of this stuff and see if they sell.\n\n00:07:21.958 --> 00:07:25.958\nSo it's a really strange business model compared to coming from a toy company.\n\n00:07:25.958 --> 00:07:28.958\nBut anyway, a friend of mine and I, Dave Hampton,\n\n00:07:28.958 --> 00:07:30.958\ndecided to see if we could do like a single-cell organism.\n\n00:07:30.958 --> 00:07:34.958\nWhat's the fewest pieces we could use to make a little life form?\n\n00:07:34.958 --> 00:07:36.958\nAnd that's our little, thirty-cent Mabuchi motor.\n\n00:07:36.958 --> 00:07:38.958\nAnd so, I have all these design books,\n\n00:07:38.958 --> 00:07:39.958\nlike I'm sure many of you have.\n\n00:07:39.958 --> 00:07:42.958\nAnd throughout the books -- this is the first page on Furby --\n\n00:07:42.958 --> 00:07:44.958\nI have kind of the art and science.\n\n00:07:44.958 --> 00:07:47.958\nI have the why over here, and the how over there.\n\n00:07:47.958 --> 00:07:50.958\nI try to do a lot of philosophy, a lot of thinking about all of these projects.\n\n00:07:50.958 --> 00:07:51.958\nBecause they're not just \"bing\" ideas;\n\n00:07:51.958 --> 00:07:54.958\nyou have to really dig deep in these things.\n\n00:07:54.958 --> 00:07:56.958\nSo there's some real pseudo-code over here,\n\n00:07:56.958 --> 00:07:59.958\nand getting the idea of different kind of drives, things like that.\n\n00:07:59.958 --> 00:08:02.958\nAnd originally, Furby only had two eyes and some batteries on the bottom.\n\n00:08:02.958 --> 00:08:03.958\nAnd then we said, well, you're going to feed him,\n\n00:08:03.958 --> 00:08:06.958\nand he needs to talk, and it got more complicated.\n\n00:08:06.958 --> 00:08:07.958\nAnd then I had to figure out how I'm going to use that one motor\n\n00:08:07.958 --> 00:08:09.958\nto make the eyes move, and the ears move,\n\n00:08:09.958 --> 00:08:11.958\nand the body to move, and the mouth to move.\n\n00:08:11.958 --> 00:08:12.958\nAnd, you know, I want to make it blink\n\n00:08:12.958 --> 00:08:14.958\nand do all that at the same time.\n\n00:08:14.958 --> 00:08:16.958\nWell, I came up with this kind of linear\n\n00:08:16.958 --> 00:08:20.958\nexpression thing with these cams and feedback. And that worked pretty well.\n\n00:08:20.958 --> 00:08:22.958\nThen I started to get a little more realistic\n\n00:08:22.958 --> 00:08:23.958\nand I have to start drawing the stuff.\n\n00:08:23.958 --> 00:08:25.958\nAnd there's my \"note to self\" at the top:\n\n00:08:25.958 --> 00:08:26.958\n\"lots of engineering.\"\n\n00:08:26.958 --> 00:08:29.958\nSo that turned out to be a little more than true.\n\n00:08:29.958 --> 00:08:32.958\nThere's my first exploded view and all the little pieces\n\n00:08:32.958 --> 00:08:34.958\nand the little worm drive and all that stuff.\n\n00:08:34.958 --> 00:08:36.958\nAnd then I've got to start building it,\n\n00:08:36.958 --> 00:08:37.958\nso this is the real thing.\n\n00:08:37.958 --> 00:08:40.958\nI get up and start cutting my finger and gluing things together.\n\n00:08:40.958 --> 00:08:41.958\nAnd that's my little workshop.\n\n00:08:41.958 --> 00:08:43.958\nAnd there's the first little cam that drove Furby.\n\n00:08:43.958 --> 00:08:45.958\nAnd there's Furby on the half shell.\n\n00:08:45.958 --> 00:08:49.958\nYou can see the little BB in the box is my tilt sensor.\n\n00:08:49.958 --> 00:08:52.958\nI just basically gnawed all this stuff out of plastic.\n\n00:08:52.958 --> 00:08:56.958\nSo there's the back of his head with a billion holes in it.\n\n00:08:56.958 --> 00:08:58.958\nAnd there I am. I'm done. There's my little Furby.\n\n00:08:58.958 --> 00:09:01.958\nNo, it's a little robot on heroin or something, I think.\n\n00:09:01.958 --> 00:09:02.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:09:02.958 --> 00:09:06.958\nSo right now, you see, I love little robots.\n\n00:09:06.958 --> 00:09:09.958\nSo my wife says, \"Well, you may like it, but nobody else will.\"\n\n00:09:09.958 --> 00:09:10.958\nSo she comes to the rescue.\n\n00:09:10.958 --> 00:09:11.958\nThis is my wife Christi, who is just, you know,\n\n00:09:11.958 --> 00:09:14.958\nmy muse and my partner for eternity here.\n\n00:09:14.958 --> 00:09:15.958\nAnd she does drawings, right?\n\n00:09:15.958 --> 00:09:17.958\nShe's an actual, you know, artist.\n\n00:09:17.958 --> 00:09:19.958\nAnd she starts doing all these different drawings\n\n00:09:19.958 --> 00:09:22.958\nand does color patterns and coloring books.\n\n00:09:22.958 --> 00:09:25.958\nAnd I like the guy with the cigar at the bottom there.\n\n00:09:25.958 --> 00:09:27.958\nHe didn't test so well, but I like him.\n\n00:09:27.958 --> 00:09:29.958\nAnd then she started doing these other images.\n\n00:09:29.958 --> 00:09:31.958\nAt that time, Beanie Babies was a big hit,\n\n00:09:31.958 --> 00:09:33.958\nand we thought, we'll do a bunch of different ones.\n\n00:09:33.958 --> 00:09:35.958\nSo here's a little pink one, a little pouf on his head.\n\n00:09:35.958 --> 00:09:39.958\nAnd here's -- this didn't do so well in testing either, I don't know why.\n\n00:09:39.958 --> 00:09:40.958\nThere's my favorite, Demon Furby.\n\n00:09:40.958 --> 00:09:42.958\nThat was a good one.\n\n00:09:42.958 --> 00:09:44.958\nAnyway, finally settled on kind of this kind of a look,\n\n00:09:44.958 --> 00:09:46.958\nlittle poufy body, a little imaginary character.\n\n00:09:46.958 --> 00:09:50.958\nAnd there he is, a little bush baby on -- caught in the headlights there.\n\n00:09:50.958 --> 00:09:52.958\nI actually went to Toys\"R\"Us, got a little furry cat,\n\n00:09:52.958 --> 00:09:54.958\nripped it apart and made this.\n\n00:09:54.958 --> 00:09:56.958\nAnd since then, every time I come home from Toys\"R\"Us\n\n00:09:56.958 --> 00:09:58.958\nwith dolls or something, they disappear from my desk\n\n00:09:58.958 --> 00:10:01.958\nand they get hidden in the house.\n\n00:10:01.958 --> 00:10:02.958\nI have three girls and they just, they --\n\n00:10:02.958 --> 00:10:04.958\nit's like a rescue animal thing they're going there.\n\n00:10:04.958 --> 00:10:06.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:10:06.958 --> 00:10:07.958\nSo, a little tether coming off,\n\n00:10:07.958 --> 00:10:10.958\nit's just a control for the Fur's mouth and his eyes.\n\n00:10:10.958 --> 00:10:12.958\nIt's just a little server control and I made a little video going:\n\n00:10:12.958 --> 00:10:14.958\n\"Hi, my name's Furby, and I'm good,\"\n\n00:10:14.958 --> 00:10:15.958\nyou know, and then I'd reach my hand.\n\n00:10:15.958 --> 00:10:17.958\nHe'd -- you can tickle him. When I put my hand up,\n\n00:10:17.958 --> 00:10:20.958\n\"Ha, ha, ha, ha\" and that's how we sold him.\n\n00:10:20.958 --> 00:10:24.958\nAnd Hasbro actually said, I meant Tiger Electronics at the time,\n\n00:10:24.958 --> 00:10:25.958\nsaid, \"Yeah, we want to do this.\n\n00:10:25.958 --> 00:10:28.958\nWe have, you know, 13 weeks or something to Toy Fair,\n\n00:10:28.958 --> 00:10:31.958\nand we're going to hire you guys to do this.\"\n\n00:10:31.958 --> 00:10:33.958\nAnd so Dave and I got working.\n\n00:10:33.958 --> 00:10:35.958\nMostly me, because it was all mechanics at this point.\n\n00:10:35.958 --> 00:10:38.958\nSo now I have to really figure out all kinds of stuff\n\n00:10:38.958 --> 00:10:39.958\nI don't know how to do.\n\n00:10:39.958 --> 00:10:40.958\nAnd I started working with Solid Works\n\n00:10:40.958 --> 00:10:41.958\nand a whole other group to do that.\n\n00:10:41.958 --> 00:10:42.958\nAnd we started --\n\n00:10:42.958 --> 00:10:45.958\nthis was way back before there was really much SLA going on,\n\n00:10:45.958 --> 00:10:46.958\nnot a lot of rapid prototyping.\n\n00:10:46.958 --> 00:10:48.958\nWe certainly didn't have the money to do this.\n\n00:10:48.958 --> 00:10:50.958\nThey only paid me, like, a little bit of money to do this,\n\n00:10:50.958 --> 00:10:52.958\nso I had to call a friend of a friend\n\n00:10:52.958 --> 00:10:56.958\nwho was running the GM prototype plant, SLA plant, that was down.\n\n00:10:56.958 --> 00:10:57.958\nAnd they said, \"Yeah, well, we'll run them.\"\n\n00:10:57.958 --> 00:10:59.958\nSo they ran all the shells for us, which was nice of them.\n\n00:10:59.958 --> 00:11:01.958\nAnd the cams I got cut at Hewlett Packard.\n\n00:11:01.958 --> 00:11:02.958\nWe snuck in on the weekend.\n\n00:11:02.958 --> 00:11:05.958\nAnd so we just had a disc of the files.\n\n00:11:05.958 --> 00:11:08.958\nBut they have a closed system, so you couldn't print the things out on the machine.\n\n00:11:08.958 --> 00:11:12.958\nSo we actually printed them out on clear and taped them on the monitors.\n\n00:11:12.958 --> 00:11:14.958\nAnd on the weekend we ran the parts for that.\n\n00:11:14.958 --> 00:11:16.958\nSo this is how they come out close to the end.\n\n00:11:16.958 --> 00:11:19.958\nAnd then they looked like little Garfields there.\n\n00:11:19.958 --> 00:11:21.958\nEight months later -- you may remember this,\n\n00:11:21.958 --> 00:11:24.958\nthis was a -- total, total, total chaos.\n\n00:11:24.958 --> 00:11:26.958\nFor a while, they were making two million Furbys a month.\n\n00:11:26.958 --> 00:11:28.958\nThey actually wound up doing about 40 million Furbys.\n\n00:11:28.958 --> 00:11:32.958\nI -- it's unbelievable how -- I don't know how that can be.\n\n00:11:32.958 --> 00:11:35.958\nAnd Hasbro made about, you know, a billion and a half dollars.\n\n00:11:35.958 --> 00:11:37.958\nAnd I just a little bit on each one.\n\n00:11:37.958 --> 00:11:40.958\nSo full circle -- why do I do this?\n\n00:11:40.958 --> 00:11:42.958\nWhy do you, you know, try to do this stuff?\n\n00:11:42.958 --> 00:11:44.958\nAnd it's, of course, for your kids.\n\n00:11:44.958 --> 00:11:46.958\nAnd there's my youngest daughter with her Furbys.\n\n00:11:46.958 --> 00:11:47.958\nAnd she still actually has those.\n\n00:11:47.958 --> 00:11:49.958\nSo I kind of retired, and we're already living in paradise\n\n00:11:49.958 --> 00:11:52.958\nup in Boise, on a river, you know. So\n\n00:11:52.958 --> 00:11:54.958\nand then I started another company called Toy Innovation\n\n00:11:54.958 --> 00:11:58.958\nand we did some projects with Mattel with\n\n00:11:58.958 --> 00:11:59.958\nactually with a lady who's here, Ivy Ross,\n\n00:11:59.958 --> 00:12:01.958\nand we did Miracle Moves Baby,\n\n00:12:01.958 --> 00:12:03.958\nmade it in Wired magazine, did a bunch of other stuff.\n\n00:12:03.958 --> 00:12:04.958\nAnd then I started another company.\n\n00:12:04.958 --> 00:12:09.958\nWe did a little hand-held device for teens that could hook up to the Internet,\n\n00:12:09.958 --> 00:12:11.958\nwon \"Best Innovations\" at CES,\n\n00:12:11.958 --> 00:12:14.958\nbut really I kind of slowed down and said, OK,\n\n00:12:14.958 --> 00:12:17.958\nI just ... After a while, I had this old tape of this dinosaur,\n\n00:12:17.958 --> 00:12:20.958\nand I gave it to this guy, and this other guy saw it,\n\n00:12:20.958 --> 00:12:22.958\nand then people started to want to do it.\n\n00:12:22.958 --> 00:12:24.958\nAnd they said they'd spend all this time.\n\n00:12:24.958 --> 00:12:26.958\nSo I said, \"OK, let's try to do this dinosaur project.\"\n\n00:12:26.958 --> 00:12:30.958\nThe crazy idea is we're going to try to clone a dinosaur\n\n00:12:30.958 --> 00:12:32.958\nas much as we can with today's technology.\n\n00:12:32.958 --> 00:12:35.958\nAnd it's not really -- but as close as we can do.\n\n00:12:35.958 --> 00:12:38.958\nAnd we're going to try to really pull this off,\n\n00:12:38.958 --> 00:12:42.958\nintentfully try to make something that seems like it's alive.\n\n00:12:42.958 --> 00:12:45.958\nNot a robot that kind of does, but let's really go for it.\n\n00:12:45.958 --> 00:12:47.958\nSo I picked a Camarasaurus,\n\n00:12:47.958 --> 00:12:51.958\nbecause the Camarasaurus was the most abundant of the sauropods in North America.\n\n00:12:51.958 --> 00:12:54.958\nAnd you could actually find full fossil evidence of these.\n\n00:12:54.958 --> 00:12:55.958\nThat's a juvenile.\n\n00:12:55.958 --> 00:12:56.958\nAnd so we actually went in.\n\n00:12:56.958 --> 00:12:58.958\nThere's a book called \"Walking on Eggshells,\"\n\n00:12:58.958 --> 00:13:01.958\nwhere they found actual sauropod skin in Patagonia.\n\n00:13:01.958 --> 00:13:03.958\nAnd the picture from the book, so when I --\n\n00:13:03.958 --> 00:13:06.958\nI told the sculptor to use this bump pattern, whatever you can to copy that.\n\n00:13:06.958 --> 00:13:08.958\nVery, very obsessive.\n\n00:13:08.958 --> 00:13:10.958\nThere's a kind of truncated Camarasaurus skeleton,\n\n00:13:10.958 --> 00:13:12.958\nbut the geometry's correct.\n\n00:13:12.958 --> 00:13:13.958\nAnd then I went in, and measured all the geometry\n\n00:13:13.958 --> 00:13:15.958\nbecause I figured, hey, biomimicry.\n\n00:13:15.958 --> 00:13:18.958\nIf I do it kind of right, it might move kind of like the real thing.\n\n00:13:18.958 --> 00:13:20.958\nSo there's the motor.\n\n00:13:20.958 --> 00:13:23.958\nAnd about this time, you know, all these other people are starting to help.\n\n00:13:23.958 --> 00:13:24.958\nHere's an example of what we did with the skull.\n\n00:13:24.958 --> 00:13:27.958\nThere's the skull, there's my drawing of a skull.\n\n00:13:27.958 --> 00:13:30.958\nThere's kind of the skin version of the soft tissue.\n\n00:13:30.958 --> 00:13:32.958\nThere's the mechanism that would go in there,\n\n00:13:32.958 --> 00:13:33.958\nkind of a Geneva drive.\n\n00:13:33.958 --> 00:13:35.958\nThere's some Solid Works versions of it.\n\n00:13:35.958 --> 00:13:37.958\nHere's some SLA parts of the same thing.\n\n00:13:37.958 --> 00:13:40.958\nAnd then, these are really crude pieces. We were just doing some tests here.\n\n00:13:40.958 --> 00:13:43.958\nThere's the skull, pretty much the same shape as the Camarasaurus.\n\n00:13:43.958 --> 00:13:46.958\nThere's a photorealistic eye behind a lens.\n\n00:13:46.958 --> 00:13:49.958\nAnd there's kind of the first exploded view, or see-through view.\n\n00:13:49.958 --> 00:13:53.958\nThere's the first SLA version, and it already kind of has the feel,\n\n00:13:53.958 --> 00:13:55.958\nit has kind of a cuteness already.\n\n00:13:55.958 --> 00:13:57.958\nAnd the thing about blending science and art\n\n00:13:57.958 --> 00:13:59.958\nin this multidisciplinary stuff is you can do a robot,\n\n00:13:59.958 --> 00:14:01.958\nand then you go back and do the shape,\n\n00:14:01.958 --> 00:14:02.958\nand then you go back and forth.\n\n00:14:02.958 --> 00:14:05.958\nThe servos in the front legs, we had to shape those like muscles.\n\n00:14:05.958 --> 00:14:06.958\nThey had to fit within the envelope.\n\n00:14:06.958 --> 00:14:10.958\nThere was a tremendous amount of work to get all that working right.\n\n00:14:10.958 --> 00:14:11.958\nAll the neck and the tail are cable,\n\n00:14:11.958 --> 00:14:13.958\nso it moves smoothly and organically.\n\n00:14:13.958 --> 00:14:14.958\nAnd then, of course, you're not done yet.\n\n00:14:14.958 --> 00:14:16.958\nYou have to get the look for the skin.\n\n00:14:16.958 --> 00:14:19.958\nThe skin's a whole another thing, probably the hardest part.\n\n00:14:19.958 --> 00:14:21.958\nSo you hire artists, and you try to get the look and feel\n\n00:14:21.958 --> 00:14:22.958\nof the character.\n\n00:14:22.958 --> 00:14:24.958\nNow, this is not -- we're character designers, right?\n\n00:14:24.958 --> 00:14:27.958\nAnd we're still trying to keep with the real character.\n\n00:14:27.958 --> 00:14:29.958\nSo, now you go back and you cover the whole thing with clay.\n\n00:14:29.958 --> 00:14:32.958\nNow you start doing the sculpture for this.\n\n00:14:32.958 --> 00:14:33.958\nAnd you can see we got a guy from --\n\n00:14:33.958 --> 00:14:36.958\nwho's just a fanatic about dinosaurs\n\n00:14:36.958 --> 00:14:37.958\nto do the sculpting for us,\n\n00:14:37.958 --> 00:14:38.958\ndown to the spoon-shaped teeth and everything.\n\n00:14:38.958 --> 00:14:40.958\nAnd then more sculpting, and then more sculpting,\n\n00:14:40.958 --> 00:14:42.958\nand then more sculpting, and then more sculpting.\n\n00:14:42.958 --> 00:14:45.958\nAnd then, four years and 10 million dollars later,\n\n00:14:45.958 --> 00:14:47.958\nwe have a little Pleo.\n\n00:14:47.958 --> 00:14:49.958\nJohn, do you want to bring him up?\n\n00:14:49.958 --> 00:14:51.958\nJohn Sosoka is our CTO, and is really the man\n\n00:14:51.958 --> 00:14:54.958\nthat's done most of the work with our 40-person company.\n\n00:14:54.958 --> 00:14:57.958\nI'd like to give John a hand. He never gets recognition. This is John Sosoka.\n\n00:14:57.958 --> 00:15:01.958\n(Applause)\n\n00:15:01.958 --> 00:15:03.958\nSo, thank you, John, thank you,\n\n00:15:03.958 --> 00:15:05.958\nand get back to work, all right, man?\n\n00:15:05.958 --> 00:15:06.958\nAll right --\n\n00:15:06.958 --> 00:15:10.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:15:10.958 --> 00:15:11.958\n-- no, it's very painful, so --\n\n00:15:11.958 --> 00:15:13.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:15:13.958 --> 00:15:17.958\n-- these are little Pleos and you can probably see them.\n\n00:15:17.958 --> 00:15:20.958\nThis -- I on purpose -- they go through life stages.\n\n00:15:20.958 --> 00:15:22.958\nSo when you first get them, they're babies.\n\n00:15:22.958 --> 00:15:24.958\nAnd you -- more you have them, kind of the older they get,\n\n00:15:24.958 --> 00:15:26.958\nand they kind of learn through their behavior.\n\n00:15:26.958 --> 00:15:31.958\nSo this one, this one's actually asleep, and -- hang on.\n\n00:15:31.958 --> 00:15:34.958\nPleo, wake up. Pleo, come on.\n\n00:15:34.958 --> 00:15:35.958\nSo this guy's listening to my voice here.\n\n00:15:35.958 --> 00:15:38.958\nBut they have 40 sensors all over their body.\n\n00:15:38.958 --> 00:15:42.958\nThey have seven processors, they have 14 motors,\n\n00:15:42.958 --> 00:15:44.958\nthey have --\n\n00:15:44.958 --> 00:15:45.958\nbut you don't care, do you?\n\n00:15:45.958 --> 00:15:49.958\nThey're just cute, right? That's the idea, that's the idea.\n\n00:15:49.958 --> 00:15:52.958\nSo you see -- hey, come on.

The book is called \"The Blank Slate,\" based on the popular idea that the human mind is a blank slate, and that all of its structure comes from socialization, culture, parenting, experience. The \"blank slate\" was an influential idea in the 20th century. Here are a few quotes indicating that: \"Man has no nature,\" from the historian Jose Ortega y Gasset; \"Man has no instincts,\" from the anthropologist Ashley Montagu; \"The human brain is capable of a full range of behaviors and predisposed to none,\" from the late scientist Stephen Jay Gould.There are a number of reasons to doubt that the human mind is a blank slate, and some of them just come from common sense. As many people have told me over the years, anyone who's had more than one child knows that kids come into the world with certain temperaments and talents; it doesn't all come from the outside. Oh, and anyone who has both a child and a house pet has surely noticed that the child, exposed to speech, will acquire a human language, whereas the house pet won't, presumably because of some innate different between them. And anyone who's ever been in a heterosexual relationship knows that the minds of men and the minds of women are not indistinguishable. There are also, I think, increasing results from the scientific study of humans that, indeed, we're not born blank slates. One of them, from anthropology, is the study of human universals. If you've ever taken anthropology, you know that it's a \u2014 kind of an occupational pleasure of anthropologists to show how exotic other cultures can be, and that there are places out there where, supposedly, everything is the opposite to the way it is here. But if you instead look at what is common to the world's cultures, you find that there is an enormously rich set of behaviors and emotions and ways of construing the world that can be found in all of the world's 6,000-odd cultures. The anthropologist Donald Brown has tried to list them all, and they range from aesthetics, affection and age statuses all the way down to weaning, weapons, weather, attempts to control, the color white and a worldview.Also, genetics and neuroscience are increasingly showing that the brain is intricately structured. This is a recent study by the neurobiologist Paul Thompson and his colleagues in which they \u2014 using MRI \u2014 measured the distribution of gray matter \u2014 that is, the outer layer of the cortex \u2014 in a large sample of pairs of people. They coded correlations in the thickness of gray matter in different parts of the brain using a false color scheme, in which no difference is coded as purple, and any color other than purple indicates a statistically significant correlation. Well, this is what happens when you pair people up at random. By definition, two people picked at random can't have correlations in the distribution of gray matter in the cortex. This is what happens in people who share half of their DNA \u2014 fraternal twins. And as you can see, large amounts of the brain are not purple, showing that if one person has a thicker bit of cortex in that region, so does his fraternal twin. And here's what happens if you get a pair of people who share all their DNA \u2014 namely, clones or identical twins. And you can see huge areas of cortex where there are massive correlations in the distribution of gray matter.Now, these aren't just differences in anatomy, like the shape of your ear lobes, but they have consequences in thought and behavior that are well illustrated in this famous cartoon by Charles Addams: \"Separated at birth, the Mallifert twins meet accidentally.\" As you can see, there are two inventors with identical contraptions in their lap, meeting in the waiting room of a patent attorney. Now, the cartoon is not such an exaggeration, because studies of identical twins who were separated at birth and then tested in adulthood show that they have astonishing similarities. And this happens in every pair of identical twins separated at birth ever studied \u2014 but much less so with fraternal twins separated at birth. My favorite example is a pair of twins, one of whom was brought up as a Catholic in a Nazi family in Germany, the other brought up in a Jewish family in Trinidad. When they walked into the lab in Minnesota, they were wearing identical navy blue shirts with epaulettes; both of them liked to dip buttered toast in coffee, both of them kept rubber bands around their wrists, both of them flushed the toilet before using it as well as after, and both of them liked to surprise people by sneezing in crowded elevators to watch them jump. Now \u2014 the story might seem to good to be true, but when you administer batteries of psychological tests, you get the same results \u2014 namely, identical twins separated at birth show quite astonishing similarities.Now, given both the common sense and scientific data calling the doctrine of the blank slate into question, why should it have been such an appealing notion? Well, there are a number of political reasons why people have found it congenial. The foremost is that if we're blank slates, then, by definition, we are equal, because zero equals zero equals zero. But if something is written on the slate, then some people could have more of it than others, and according to this line of thinking, that would justify discrimination and inequality.Another political fear of human nature is that if we are blank slates, we can perfect mankind \u2014 the age-old dream of the perfectibility of our species through social engineering. Whereas, if we're born with certain instincts, then perhaps some of them might condemn us to selfishness, prejudice and violence. Well, in the book, I argue that these are, in fact, non sequiturs. And just to make a long story short: first of all, the concept of fairness is not the same as the concept of sameness. And so when Thomas Jefferson wrote in the Declaration of Independence, \"We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal,\" he did not mean \"We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are clones.\" Rather, that all men are equal in terms of their rights, and that every person ought to be treated as an individual, and not prejudged by the statistics of particular groups that they may belong to. Also, even if we were born with certain ignoble motives, they don't automatically lead to ignoble behavior. That is because the human mind is a complex system with many parts, and some of them can inhibit others. For example, there's excellent reason to believe that virtually all humans are born with a moral sense, and that we have cognitive abilities that allow us to profit from the lessons of history. So even if people did have impulses towards selfishness or greed, that's not the only thing in the skull, and there are other parts of the mind that can counteract them.In the book, I go over controversies such as this one, and a number of other hot buttons, hot zones, Chernobyls, third rails, and so on \u2014 including the arts, cloning, crime, free will, education, evolution, gender differences, God, homosexuality, infanticide, inequality, Marxism, morality, Nazism, parenting, politics, race, rape, religion, resource depletion, social engineering, technological risk and war. And needless to say, there were certain risks in taking on these subjects. When I wrote a first draft of the book, I circulated it to a number of colleagues for comments, and here are some of the reactions that I got: \"Better get a security camera for your house.\" \"Don't expect to get any more awards, job offers or positions in scholarly societies.\" \"Tell your publisher not to list your hometown in your author bio.\" \"Do you have tenure?\" (Laughter)Well, the book came out in October, and nothing terrible has happened. I \u2014 I like \u2014 There was indeed reason to be nervous, and there were moments in which I did feel nervous, knowing the history of what has happened to people who've taken controversial stands or discovered disquieting findings in the behavioral sciences. There are many cases, some of which I talk about in the book, of people who have been slandered, called Nazis, physically assaulted, threatened with criminal prosecution for stumbling across or arguing about controversial findings. And you never know when you're going to come across one of these booby traps. My favorite example is a pair of psychologists who did research on left-handers, and published some data showing that left-handers are, on average, more susceptible to disease, more prone to accidents and have a shorter lifespan. It's not clear, by the way, since then, whether that is an accurate generalization, but the data at the time seemed to support that. Well, pretty soon they were barraged with enraged letters, death threats, ban on the topic in a number of scientific journals, coming from irate left-handers and their advocates, and they were literally afraid to open their mail because of the venom and vituperation that they had inadvertently inspired.Well, the night is young, but the book has been out for half a year, and nothing terrible has happened. None of the dire professional consequences has taken place \u2014 I haven't been exiled from the city of Cambridge. But what I wanted to talk about are two of these hot buttons that have aroused the strongest response in the 80-odd reviews that The Blank Slate has received. I'll just put that list up for a few seconds, and see if you can guess which two \u2014 I would estimate that probably two of these topics inspired probably 90 percent of the reaction in the various reviews and radio interviews. It's not violence and war, it's not race, it's not gender, it's not Marxism, it's not Nazism. They are: the arts and parenting. (Laughter) So let me tell you what aroused such irate responses, and I'll let you decide if whether they \u2014 the claims are really that outrageous.Let me start with the arts. I note that among the long list of human universals that I presented a few slides ago are art. There is no society ever discovered in the remotest corner of the world that has not had something that we would consider the arts. Visual arts \u2014 decoration of surfaces and bodies \u2014 appears to be a human universal. The telling of stories, music, dance, poetry \u2014 found in all cultures, and many of the motifs and themes that give us pleasure in the arts can be found in all human societies: a preference for symmetrical forms, the use of repetition and variation, even things as specific as the fact that in poetry all over the world, you have lines that are very close to three seconds long, separated by pauses. Now, on the other hand, in the second half of the 20th century, the arts are frequently said to be in decline. And I have a collection, probably 10 or 15 headlines, from highbrow magazines deploring the fact that the arts are in decline in our time. I'll give you a couple of representative quotes: \"We can assert with some confidence that our own period is one of decline, that the standards of culture are lower than they were 50 years ago, and that the evidences of this decline are visible in every department of human activity.\" That's a quote from T. S. Eliot, a little more than 50 years ago. And a more recent one: \"The possibility of sustaining high culture in our time is becoming increasing problematical. Serious book stores are losing their franchise, nonprofit theaters are surviving primarily by commercializing their repertory, symphony orchestras are diluting their programs, public television is increasing its dependence on reruns of British sitcoms, classical radio stations are dwindling, museums are resorting to blockbuster shows, dance is dying.\" That's from Robert Brustein, the famous drama critic and director, in The New Republic about five years ago.Well, in fact, the arts are not in decline. I don't think this will as a surprise to anyone in this room, but by any standard they have never been flourishing to a greater extent. There are, of course, entirely new art forms and new media, many of which you've heard over these few days. By any economic standard, the demand for art of all forms is skyrocketing, as you can tell from the price of opera tickets, by the number of books sold, by the number of books published, the number of musical titles released, the number of new albums and so on. The only grain of truth to this complaint that the arts are in decline come from three spheres. One of them is in elite art since the 1930s \u2014 say, the kinds of works performed by major symphony orchestras, where most of the repertory is before 1930, or the works shown in major galleries and prestigious museums. In literary criticism and analysis, probably 40 or 50 years ago, literary critics were a kind of cultural hero; now they're kind of a national joke. And the humanities and arts programs in the universities, which by many measures, indeed are in decline. Students are staying away in droves, universities are disinvesting in the arts and humanities.Well, here's a diagnosis. They didn't ask me, but by their own admission, they need all the help that they can get. And I would like to suggest that it's not a coincidence that this supposed decline in the elite arts and criticism occurred in the same point in history in which there was a widespread denial of human nature. A famous quotation can be found \u2014 if you look on the web, you can find it in literally scores of English core syllabuses \u2014 \"In or about December 1910, human nature changed.\" A paraphrase of a quote by Virginia Woolf, and there's some debate as to what she actually meant by that. But it's very clear, looking at these syllabuses, that \u2014 it's used now as a way of saying that all forms of appreciation of art that were in place for centuries, or millennia, in the 20th century were discarded. The beauty and pleasure in art \u2014 probably a human universal \u2014 were \u2014 began to be considered saccharine, or kitsch, or commercial. Barnett Newman had a famous quote that \"the impulse of modern art is the desire to destroy beauty\" \u2014 which was considered bourgeois or tacky. And here's just one example. I mean, this is perhaps a representative example of the visual depiction of the female form in the 15th century; here is a representative example of the depiction of the female form in the 20th century. And, as you can see, there \u2014 something has changed in the way the elite arts appeal to the senses.Indeed, in movements of modernism and post-modernism, there was visual art without beauty, literature without narrative and plot, poetry without meter and rhyme, architecture and planning without ornament, human scale, green space and natural light, music without melody and rhythm, and criticism without clarity, attention to aesthetics and insight into the human condition. (Laughter) Let me give just you an example to back up that last statement. But here, there \u2014 one of the most famous literary English scholars of our time is the Berkeley professor, Judith Butler. And here is an example of one of her analyses: \"The move from a structuralist account in which capital is understood to structure social relations in relatively homologous ways to a view of hegemony in which power relations are subject to repetition, convergence and rearticulation brought the question of temporality into the thinking of structure, and marked a shift from the form of Althusserian theory that takes structural totalities as theoretical objects ...\" Well, you get the idea. By the way, this is one sentence \u2014 you can actually parse it. Well, the argument in \"The Blank Slate\" was that elite art and criticism in the 20th century, although not the arts in general, have disdained beauty, pleasure, clarity, insight and style. People are staying away from elite art and criticism. What a puzzle \u2014 I wonder why. Well, this turned out to be probably the most controversial claim in the book. Someone asked me whether I stuck it in in order to deflect ire from discussions of gender and Nazism and race and so on. I won't comment on that. But it certainly inspired an energetic reaction from many university professors.Well, the other hot button is parenting. And the starting point is the \u2014 for that discussion was the fact that we have all been subject to the advice of the parenting industrial complex. Now, here is \u2014 here is a representative quote from a besieged mother: \"I'm overwhelmed with parenting advice. I'm supposed to do lots of physical activity with my kids so I can instill in them a physical fitness habit so they'll grow up to be healthy adults. And I'm supposed to do all kinds of intellectual play so they'll grow up smart. And there are all kinds of play \u2014 clay for finger dexterity, word games for reading success, large motor play, small motor play. I feel like I could devote my life to figuring out what to play with my kids.\" I think anyone who's recently been a parent can sympathize with this mother.Well, here's some sobering facts about parenting. Most studies of parenting on which this advice is based are useless. They're useless because they don't control for heritability. They measure some correlation between what the parents do, how the children turn out and assume a causal relation: that the parenting shaped the child. Parents who talk a lot to their kids have kids who grow up to be articulate, parents who spank their kids have kids who grow up to be violent and so on. And very few of them control for the possibility that parents pass on genes for \u2014 that increase the chances a child will be articulate or violent and so on. Until the studies are redone with adoptive children, who provide an environment but not genes to their kids, we have no way of knowing whether these conclusions are valid.The genetically controlled studies have some sobering results. Remember the Mallifert twins: separated at birth, then they meet in the patent office \u2014 remarkably similar. Well, what would have happened if the Mallifert twins had grown up together? You might think, well, then they'd be even more similar, because not only would they share their genes, but they would also share their environment. That would make them super-similar, right? Wrong. Identical twins, or any siblings, who are separated at birth are no less similar than if they had grown up together. Everything that happens to you in a given home over all of those years appears to leave no permanent stamp on your personality or intellect. A complementary finding, from a completely different methodology, is that adopted siblings reared together \u2014 the mirror image of identical twins reared apart, they share their parents, their home, their neighborhood, don't share their genes \u2014 end up not similar at all. OK \u2014 two different bodies of research with a similar finding.What it suggests is that children are shaped not by their parents over the long run, but in part \u2014 only in part \u2014 by their genes, in part by their culture \u2014 the culture of the country at large and the children's own culture, namely their peer group \u2014 as we heard from Jill Sobule earlier today, that's what kids care about \u2014 and, to a very large extent, larger than most people are prepared to acknowledge, by chance: chance events in the wiring of the brain in utero; chance events as you live your life.So let me conclude with just a remark to bring it back to the theme of choices. I think that the sciences of human nature \u2014 behavioral genetics, evolutionary psychology, neuroscience, cognitive science \u2014 are going to, increasingly in the years to come, upset various dogmas, careers and deeply-held political belief systems. And that presents us with a choice. The choice is whether certain facts about humans, or topics, are to be considered taboos, forbidden knowledge, where we shouldn't go there because no good can come from it, or whether we should explore them honestly. I have my own answer to that question, which comes from a great artist of the 19th century, Anton Chekhov, who said, \"Man will become better when you show him what he is like.\" And I think that the argument can't be put any more eloquently than that. Thank you very much.

00:01:31.958\nwhereas the house pet won't,\n\n00:01:31.958 --> 00:01:33.958\npresumably because of some innate different between them.\n\n00:01:34.958 --> 00:01:36.958\nAnd anyone who's ever been\n\n00:01:36.958 --> 00:01:38.958\nin a heterosexual relationship knows that\n\n00:01:38.958 --> 00:01:40.958\nthe minds of men and the minds of women are not indistinguishable.\n\n00:01:42.958 --> 00:01:44.958\nThere are also, I think,\n\n00:01:44.958 --> 00:01:46.958\nincreasing results from\n\n00:01:46.958 --> 00:01:48.958\nthe scientific study of humans\n\n00:01:48.958 --> 00:01:50.958\nthat, indeed, we're not born blank slates.\n\n00:01:51.958 --> 00:01:54.958\nOne of them, from anthropology,\n\n00:01:54.958 --> 00:01:56.958\nis the study of human universals.\n\n00:01:56.958 --> 00:01:58.958\nIf you've ever taken anthropology, you know that it's a --\n\n00:01:58.958 --> 00:02:00.958\nkind of an occupational\n\n00:02:00.958 --> 00:02:02.958\npleasure of anthropologists to show\n\n00:02:02.958 --> 00:02:05.958\nhow exotic other cultures can be,\n\n00:02:05.958 --> 00:02:07.958\nand that there are places out there where, supposedly,\n\n00:02:07.958 --> 00:02:09.958\neverything is the opposite to the way it is here.\n\n00:02:10.958 --> 00:02:12.958\nBut if you instead\n\n00:02:12.958 --> 00:02:16.958\nlook at what is common to the world's cultures,\n\n00:02:16.958 --> 00:02:18.958\nyou find that there is an enormously rich set\n\n00:02:18.958 --> 00:02:21.958\nof behaviors and emotions\n\n00:02:21.958 --> 00:02:23.958\nand ways of construing the world\n\n00:02:23.958 --> 00:02:26.958\nthat can be found in all of the world's 6,000-odd cultures.\n\n00:02:27.958 --> 00:02:30.958\nThe anthropologist Donald Brown has tried to list them all,\n\n00:02:30.958 --> 00:02:32.958\nand they range from aesthetics,\n\n00:02:32.958 --> 00:02:35.958\naffection and age statuses\n\n00:02:35.958 --> 00:02:38.958\nall the way down to weaning, weapons, weather,\n\n00:02:38.958 --> 00:02:40.958\nattempts to control, the color white\n\n00:02:40.958 --> 00:02:42.958\nand a worldview.\n\n00:02:42.958 --> 00:02:44.958\nAlso, genetics and neuroscience\n\n00:02:44.958 --> 00:02:46.958\nare increasingly showing that the brain\n\n00:02:46.958 --> 00:02:48.958\nis intricately structured.\n\n00:02:49.958 --> 00:02:51.958\nThis is a recent study by the neurobiologist Paul Thompson\n\n00:02:51.958 --> 00:02:53.958\nand his colleagues in which they --\n\n00:02:53.958 --> 00:02:55.958\nusing MRI --\n\n00:02:55.958 --> 00:02:57.958\nmeasured the distribution of gray matter --\n\n00:02:58.958 --> 00:03:01.958\nthat is, the outer layer of the cortex --\n\n00:03:01.958 --> 00:03:04.958\nin a large sample of pairs of people.\n\n00:03:04.958 --> 00:03:07.958\nThey coded correlations in the thickness\n\n00:03:08.958 --> 00:03:10.958\nof gray matter in different parts of the brain\n\n00:03:10.958 --> 00:03:13.958\nusing a false color scheme, in which\n\n00:03:13.958 --> 00:03:16.958\nno difference is coded as purple,\n\n00:03:16.958 --> 00:03:18.958\nand any color other than purple indicates\n\n00:03:18.958 --> 00:03:20.958\na statistically significant correlation.\n\n00:03:20.958 --> 00:03:23.958\nWell, this is what happens when you pair people up at random.\n\n00:03:23.958 --> 00:03:26.958\nBy definition, two people picked at random\n\n00:03:26.958 --> 00:03:28.958\ncan't have correlations in the distribution\n\n00:03:28.958 --> 00:03:31.958\nof gray matter in the cortex.\n\n00:03:31.958 --> 00:03:34.958\nThis is what happens in people who share\n\n00:03:34.958 --> 00:03:37.958\nhalf of their DNA -- fraternal twins.\n\n00:03:37.958 --> 00:03:39.958\nAnd as you can see, large amounts of the brain\n\n00:03:39.958 --> 00:03:42.958\nare not purple, showing that if one person\n\n00:03:42.958 --> 00:03:45.958\nhas a thicker bit of cortex\n\n00:03:45.958 --> 00:03:48.958\nin that region, so does his fraternal twin.\n\n00:03:48.958 --> 00:03:51.958\nAnd here's what happens if you\n\n00:03:52.958 --> 00:03:54.958\nget a pair of people who share all their DNA --\n\n00:03:54.958 --> 00:03:57.958\nnamely, clones or identical twins.\n\n00:03:57.958 --> 00:04:01.958\nAnd you can see huge areas of cortex where there are\n\n00:04:01.958 --> 00:04:04.958\nmassive correlations in the distribution of gray matter.\n\n00:04:04.958 --> 00:04:06.958\nNow, these aren't just\n\n00:04:06.958 --> 00:04:08.958\ndifferences in anatomy,\n\n00:04:08.958 --> 00:04:10.958\nlike the shape of your ear lobes,\n\n00:04:10.958 --> 00:04:14.958\nbut they have consequences in thought and behavior\n\n00:04:14.958 --> 00:04:18.958\nthat are well illustrated in this famous cartoon by Charles Addams:\n\n00:04:18.958 --> 00:04:22.958\n\"Separated at birth, the Mallifert twins meet accidentally.\"\n\n00:04:23.958 --> 00:04:25.958\nAs you can see, there are two inventors\n\n00:04:25.958 --> 00:04:27.958\nwith identical contraptions in their lap, meeting\n\n00:04:27.958 --> 00:04:29.958\nin the waiting room of a patent attorney.\n\n00:04:29.958 --> 00:04:32.958\nNow, the cartoon is not such an exaggeration, because\n\n00:04:32.958 --> 00:04:35.958\nstudies of identical twins who were separated at birth\n\n00:04:35.958 --> 00:04:37.958\nand then tested in adulthood\n\n00:04:37.958 --> 00:04:40.958\nshow that they have astonishing similarities.\n\n00:04:40.958 --> 00:04:43.958\nAnd this happens in every pair of identical twins\n\n00:04:43.958 --> 00:04:45.958\nseparated at birth ever studied --\n\n00:04:45.958 --> 00:04:48.958\nbut much less so with fraternal twins separated at birth.\n\n00:04:48.958 --> 00:04:51.958\nMy favorite example is a pair of twins,\n\n00:04:51.958 --> 00:04:53.958\none of whom was brought up\n\n00:04:53.958 --> 00:04:57.958\nas a Catholic in a Nazi family in Germany,\n\n00:04:57.958 --> 00:05:00.958\nthe other brought up in a Jewish family in Trinidad.\n\n00:05:01.958 --> 00:05:03.958\nWhen they walked into the lab in Minnesota,\n\n00:05:03.958 --> 00:05:06.958\nthey were wearing identical navy blue shirts with epaulettes;\n\n00:05:06.958 --> 00:05:09.958\nboth of them liked to dip buttered toast in coffee,\n\n00:05:09.958 --> 00:05:13.958\nboth of them kept rubber bands around their wrists,\n\n00:05:13.958 --> 00:05:16.958\nboth of them flushed the toilet before using it as well as after,\n\n00:05:16.958 --> 00:05:19.958\nand both of them liked to surprise people\n\n00:05:19.958 --> 00:05:23.958\nby sneezing in crowded elevators to watch them jump.\n\n00:05:23.958 --> 00:05:25.958\nNow --\n\n00:05:25.958 --> 00:05:27.958\nthe story might seem to good to be true,\n\n00:05:27.958 --> 00:05:29.958\nbut when you administer\n\n00:05:29.958 --> 00:05:32.958\nbatteries of psychological tests,\n\n00:05:32.958 --> 00:05:34.958\nyou get the same results -- namely,\n\n00:05:34.958 --> 00:05:36.958\nidentical twins separated at birth show\n\n00:05:36.958 --> 00:05:38.958\nquite astonishing similarities.\n\n00:05:38.958 --> 00:05:40.958\nNow, given both the common sense\n\n00:05:40.958 --> 00:05:42.958\nand scientific data\n\n00:05:42.958 --> 00:05:44.958\ncalling the doctrine of the blank slate into question,\n\n00:05:44.958 --> 00:05:47.958\nwhy should it have been such an appealing notion?\n\n00:05:47.958 --> 00:05:50.958\nWell, there are a number of political reasons why people have found it congenial.\n\n00:05:50.958 --> 00:05:53.958\nThe foremost is that if we're blank slates,\n\n00:05:53.958 --> 00:05:55.958\nthen, by definition, we are equal,\n\n00:05:55.958 --> 00:05:57.958\nbecause zero equals zero equals zero.\n\n00:05:58.958 --> 00:06:00.958\nBut if something is written on the slate,\n\n00:06:00.958 --> 00:06:02.958\nthen some people could have more of it than others,\n\n00:06:02.958 --> 00:06:04.958\nand according to this line of thinking, that would justify\n\n00:06:04.958 --> 00:06:07.958\ndiscrimination and inequality.\n\n00:06:07.958 --> 00:06:10.958\nAnother political fear of human nature\n\n00:06:10.958 --> 00:06:12.958\nis that if we are blank slates,\n\n00:06:12.958 --> 00:06:14.958\nwe can perfect mankind --\n\n00:06:14.958 --> 00:06:17.958\nthe age-old dream of the perfectibility of our species\n\n00:06:17.958 --> 00:06:19.958\nthrough social engineering.\n\n00:06:19.958 --> 00:06:21.958\nWhereas, if we're born with certain instincts,\n\n00:06:21.958 --> 00:06:23.958\nthen perhaps some of them might condemn us\n\n00:06:23.958 --> 00:06:26.958\nto selfishness, prejudice and violence.\n\n00:06:27.958 --> 00:06:30.958\nWell, in the book, I argue that these are, in fact, non sequiturs.\n\n00:06:31.958 --> 00:06:33.958\nAnd just to make a long story short:\n\n00:06:33.958 --> 00:06:35.958\nfirst of all, the concept of fairness\n\n00:06:35.958 --> 00:06:38.958\nis not the same as the concept of sameness.\n\n00:06:38.958 --> 00:06:40.958\nAnd so when Thomas Jefferson wrote\n\n00:06:40.958 --> 00:06:42.958\nin the Declaration of Independence,\n\n00:06:42.958 --> 00:06:44.958\n\"We hold these truths to be self-evident,\n\n00:06:44.958 --> 00:06:47.958\nthat all men are created equal,\"\n\n00:06:47.958 --> 00:06:49.958\nhe did not mean \"We hold these truths to be self-evident,\n\n00:06:49.958 --> 00:06:52.958\nthat all men are clones.\"\n\n00:06:52.958 --> 00:06:55.958\nRather, that all men are equal in terms of their rights,\n\n00:06:55.958 --> 00:06:58.958\nand that every person ought to be treated\n\n00:06:58.958 --> 00:07:00.958\nas an individual, and not prejudged\n\n00:07:00.958 --> 00:07:02.958\nby the statistics of particular groups\n\n00:07:02.958 --> 00:07:05.958\nthat they may belong to.\n\n00:07:05.958 --> 00:07:07.958\nAlso, even if we were born\n\n00:07:07.958 --> 00:07:09.958\nwith certain ignoble motives,\n\n00:07:09.958 --> 00:07:12.958\nthey don't automatically lead to ignoble behavior.\n\n00:07:12.958 --> 00:07:14.958\nThat is because the human mind\n\n00:07:14.958 --> 00:07:16.958\nis a complex system with many parts,\n\n00:07:16.958 --> 00:07:19.958\nand some of them can inhibit others.\n\n00:07:19.958 --> 00:07:22.958\nFor example, there's excellent reason to believe\n\n00:07:22.958 --> 00:07:25.958\nthat virtually all humans are born with a moral sense,\n\n00:07:26.958 --> 00:07:29.958\nand that we have cognitive abilities that allow us\n\n00:07:29.958 --> 00:07:31.958\nto profit from the lessons of history.\n\n00:07:31.958 --> 00:07:33.958\nSo even if people did have impulses\n\n00:07:33.958 --> 00:07:35.958\ntowards selfishness or greed,\n\n00:07:35.958 --> 00:07:37.958\nthat's not the only thing in the skull,\n\n00:07:37.958 --> 00:07:39.958\nand there are other parts of the mind that can counteract them.\n\n00:07:40.958 --> 00:07:42.958\nIn the book, I\n\n00:07:42.958 --> 00:07:44.958\ngo over controversies such as this one,\n\n00:07:44.958 --> 00:07:47.958\nand a number of other hot buttons,\n\n00:07:47.958 --> 00:07:50.958\nhot zones, Chernobyls, third rails, and so on --\n\n00:07:50.958 --> 00:07:52.958\nincluding the arts, cloning, crime,\n\n00:07:52.958 --> 00:07:54.958\nfree will, education, evolution,\n\n00:07:54.958 --> 00:07:57.958\ngender differences, God, homosexuality,\n\n00:07:57.958 --> 00:07:59.958\ninfanticide, inequality, Marxism, morality,\n\n00:07:59.958 --> 00:08:01.958\nNazism, parenting, politics,\n\n00:08:01.958 --> 00:08:03.958\nrace, rape, religion, resource depletion,\n\n00:08:03.958 --> 00:08:06.958\nsocial engineering, technological risk and war.\n\n00:08:06.958 --> 00:08:08.958\nAnd needless to say, there were certain risks\n\n00:08:08.958 --> 00:08:11.958\nin taking on these subjects.\n\n00:08:12.958 --> 00:08:15.958\nWhen I wrote a first draft of the book,\n\n00:08:15.958 --> 00:08:17.958\nI circulated it to a number of colleagues for comments,\n\n00:08:17.958 --> 00:08:20.958\nand here are some of\n\n00:08:20.958 --> 00:08:22.958\nthe reactions that I got:\n\n00:08:22.958 --> 00:08:25.958\n\"Better get a security camera for your house.\"\n\n00:08:26.958 --> 00:08:29.958\n\"Don't expect to get any more awards, job offers\n\n00:08:29.958 --> 00:08:31.958\nor positions in scholarly societies.\"\n\n00:08:32.958 --> 00:08:34.958\n\"Tell your publisher not to list your hometown\n\n00:08:34.958 --> 00:08:37.958\nin your author bio.\"\n\n00:08:37.958 --> 00:08:39.958\n\"Do you have tenure?\"\n\n00:08:39.958 --> 00:08:41.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:08:41.958 --> 00:08:43.958\nWell, the book came out in October,\n\n00:08:43.958 --> 00:08:46.958\nand nothing terrible has happened.\n\n00:08:48.958 --> 00:08:51.958\nI -- I like --\n\n00:08:51.958 --> 00:08:53.958\nThere was indeed reason to be nervous,\n\n00:08:53.958 --> 00:08:55.958\nand there were moments in which I did feel nervous,\n\n00:08:55.958 --> 00:08:57.958\nknowing the history\n\n00:08:57.958 --> 00:08:59.958\nof what has happened to people\n\n00:08:59.958 --> 00:09:01.958\nwho've taken controversial stands\n\n00:09:01.958 --> 00:09:04.958\nor discovered disquieting findings\n\n00:09:04.958 --> 00:09:06.958\nin the behavioral sciences.\n\n00:09:06.958 --> 00:09:09.958\nThere are many cases, some of which I talk about in the book,\n\n00:09:09.958 --> 00:09:13.958\nof people who have been slandered, called Nazis,\n\n00:09:13.958 --> 00:09:16.958\nphysically assaulted, threatened with criminal prosecution\n\n00:09:16.958 --> 00:09:19.958\nfor stumbling across or arguing\n\n00:09:20.958 --> 00:09:22.958\nabout controversial findings.\n\n00:09:23.958 --> 00:09:25.958\nAnd you never know when you're going to\n\n00:09:25.958 --> 00:09:27.958\ncome across one of these booby traps.\n\n00:09:27.958 --> 00:09:29.958\nMy favorite example is a pair of psychologists\n\n00:09:29.958 --> 00:09:32.958\nwho did research on left-handers,\n\n00:09:32.958 --> 00:09:35.958\nand published some data showing that left-handers are, on average,\n\n00:09:35.958 --> 00:09:38.958\nmore susceptible to disease, more prone to accidents\n\n00:09:38.958 --> 00:09:40.958\nand have a shorter lifespan.\n\n00:09:40.958 --> 00:09:42.958\nIt's not clear, by the way, since then,\n\n00:09:42.958 --> 00:09:45.958\nwhether that is an accurate generalization,\n\n00:09:45.958 --> 00:09:48.958\nbut the data at the time seemed to support that.\n\n00:09:48.958 --> 00:09:50.958\nWell, pretty soon they were barraged\n\n00:09:50.958 --> 00:09:53.958\nwith enraged letters,\n\n00:09:53.958 --> 00:09:55.958\ndeath threats,\n\n00:09:55.958 --> 00:09:58.958\nban on the topic in a number of scientific journals,\n\n00:09:58.958 --> 00:10:01.958\ncoming from irate left-handers\n\n00:10:01.958 --> 00:10:03.958\nand their advocates,\n\n00:10:03.958 --> 00:10:06.958\nand they were literally afraid to open their mail\n\n00:10:06.958 --> 00:10:09.958\nbecause of the venom and vituperation\n\n00:10:09.958 --> 00:10:12.958\nthat they had inadvertently inspired.\n\n00:10:12.958 --> 00:10:14.958\nWell,\n\n00:10:14.958 --> 00:10:16.958\nthe night is young, but the book has been out\n\n00:10:16.958 --> 00:10:18.958\nfor half a year,\n\n00:10:18.958 --> 00:10:20.958\nand nothing terrible has happened.\n\n00:10:20.958 --> 00:10:22.958\nNone of the dire professional consequences\n\n00:10:22.958 --> 00:10:24.958\nhas taken place --\n\n00:10:24.958 --> 00:10:26.958\nI haven't been\n\n00:10:26.958 --> 00:10:29.958\nexiled from the city of Cambridge.\n\n00:10:29.958 --> 00:10:31.958\nBut what I wanted to talk about\n\n00:10:31.958 --> 00:10:34.958\nare two of these hot buttons\n\n00:10:34.958 --> 00:10:38.958\nthat have aroused the strongest response\n\n00:10:38.958 --> 00:10:40.958\nin the 80-odd reviews\n\n00:10:40.958 --> 00:10:43.958\nthat The Blank Slate has received.\n\n00:10:43.958 --> 00:10:46.958\nI'll just put that list up for a few seconds,\n\n00:10:46.958 --> 00:10:48.958\nand see if you can guess which two\n\n00:10:48.958 --> 00:10:50.958\n-- I would estimate that probably two of these topics\n\n00:10:50.958 --> 00:10:53.958\ninspired probably 90 percent\n\n00:10:53.958 --> 00:10:56.958\nof the reaction in the various reviews\n\n00:10:56.958 --> 00:10:58.958\nand radio interviews.\n\n00:10:58.958 --> 00:11:00.958\nIt's not violence and war,\n\n00:11:00.958 --> 00:11:02.958\nit's not race, it's not gender,\n\n00:11:02.958 --> 00:11:05.958\nit's not Marxism, it's not Nazism.\n\n00:11:05.958 --> 00:11:08.958\nThey are: the arts and parenting.\n\n00:11:08.958 --> 00:11:10.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:11:10.958 --> 00:11:12.958\nSo let me tell you what\n\n00:11:12.958 --> 00:11:14.958\naroused such irate responses,\n\n00:11:14.958 --> 00:11:17.958\nand I'll let you decide if whether they --\n\n00:11:17.958 --> 00:11:19.958\nthe claims are really that outrageous.\n\n00:11:19.958 --> 00:11:22.958\nLet me start with the arts.\n\n00:11:22.958 --> 00:11:24.958\nI note that among the long list of human universals\n\n00:11:24.958 --> 00:11:27.958\nthat I presented a few slides ago\n\n00:11:27.958 --> 00:11:29.958\nare art.\n\n00:11:29.958 --> 00:11:32.958\nThere is no society ever discovered\n\n00:11:32.958 --> 00:11:35.958\nin the remotest corner of the world that has not had something\n\n00:11:35.958 --> 00:11:38.958\nthat we would consider the arts.\n\n00:11:39.958 --> 00:11:41.958\nVisual arts -- decoration of surfaces and bodies --\n\n00:11:41.958 --> 00:11:43.958\nappears to be a human universal.\n\n00:11:43.958 --> 00:11:45.958\nThe telling of stories, music,\n\n00:11:45.958 --> 00:11:48.958\ndance, poetry -- found in all cultures,\n\n00:11:48.958 --> 00:11:51.958\nand many of the motifs and themes\n\n00:11:51.958 --> 00:11:54.958\nthat\n\n00:11:54.958 --> 00:11:56.958\ngive us pleasure in the arts\n\n00:11:56.958 --> 00:11:59.958\ncan be found in all human societies:\n\n00:12:00.958 --> 00:12:03.958\na preference for symmetrical forms,\n\n00:12:03.958 --> 00:12:05.958\nthe use of repetition and variation,\n\n00:12:05.958 --> 00:12:07.958\neven things as specific as the fact\n\n00:12:07.958 --> 00:12:09.958\nthat in poetry all over the world,\n\n00:12:09.958 --> 00:12:12.958\nyou have lines that are very close\n\n00:12:12.958 --> 00:12:15.958\nto three seconds long, separated by pauses.\n\n00:12:15.958 --> 00:12:17.958\nNow, on the other hand,\n\n00:12:17.958 --> 00:12:19.958\nin the second half of the 20th century,\n\n00:12:19.958 --> 00:12:22.958\nthe arts are frequently said to be in decline.\n\n00:12:22.958 --> 00:12:24.958\nAnd I have a collection,\n\n00:12:24.958 --> 00:12:27.958\nprobably 10 or 15 headlines, from highbrow magazines\n\n00:12:27.958 --> 00:12:29.958\ndeploring the fact that\n\n00:12:29.958 --> 00:12:32.958\nthe arts are in decline in our time.\n\n00:12:32.958 --> 00:12:35.958\nI'll give you a couple of representative quotes:\n\n00:12:35.958 --> 00:12:37.958\n\"We can assert with some confidence that our own period is\n\n00:12:37.958 --> 00:12:40.958\none of decline, that the standards of culture are lower\n\n00:12:40.958 --> 00:12:43.958\nthan they were 50 years ago, and that the evidences of this decline\n\n00:12:43.958 --> 00:12:46.958\nare visible in every department of human activity.\"\n\n00:12:46.958 --> 00:12:49.958\nThat's a quote from T. S. Eliot, a little more than 50 years ago.\n\n00:12:49.958 --> 00:12:51.958\nAnd a more recent one:\n\n00:12:51.958 --> 00:12:53.958\n\"The possibility of sustaining high culture in our time\n\n00:12:53.958 --> 00:12:56.958\nis becoming increasing problematical.\n\n00:12:56.958 --> 00:12:58.958\nSerious book stores are losing their franchise,\n\n00:12:58.958 --> 00:13:00.958\nnonprofit theaters are surviving primarily\n\n00:13:00.958 --> 00:13:02.958\nby commercializing their repertory,\n\n00:13:02.958 --> 00:13:04.958\nsymphony orchestras are diluting their programs,\n\n00:13:04.958 --> 00:13:06.958\npublic television is increasing its dependence\n\n00:13:06.958 --> 00:13:09.958\non reruns of British sitcoms,\n\n00:13:09.958 --> 00:13:11.958\nclassical radio stations are dwindling,\n\n00:13:11.958 --> 00:13:13.958\nmuseums are resorting to blockbuster shows, dance is dying.\"\n\n00:13:13.958 --> 00:13:15.958\nThat's from Robert Brustein,\n\n00:13:15.958 --> 00:13:18.958\nthe famous drama critic and director,\n\n00:13:18.958 --> 00:13:21.958\nin The New Republic about five years ago.\n\n00:13:21.958 --> 00:13:24.958\nWell, in fact, the arts are not in decline.\n\n00:13:24.958 --> 00:13:27.958\nI don't think this will as a surprise to anyone in this room,\n\n00:13:27.958 --> 00:13:29.958\nbut by any standard\n\n00:13:29.958 --> 00:13:31.958\nthey have never been flourishing\n\n00:13:31.958 --> 00:13:33.958\nto a greater extent.\n\n00:13:33.958 --> 00:13:36.958\nThere are, of course, entirely new art forms\n\n00:13:36.958 --> 00:13:38.958\nand new media, many of which you've heard\n\n00:13:38.958 --> 00:13:41.958\nover these few days.\n\n00:13:41.958 --> 00:13:43.958\nBy any economic standard,\n\n00:13:43.958 --> 00:13:46.958\nthe demand for art of all forms\n\n00:13:46.958 --> 00:13:48.958\nis skyrocketing,\n\n00:13:48.958 --> 00:13:50.958\nas you can tell from the price of opera tickets,\n\n00:13:50.958 --> 00:13:52.958\nby the number of books sold,\n\n00:13:52.958 --> 00:13:54.958\nby the number of books published,\n\n00:13:54.958 --> 00:13:57.958\nthe number of musical titles released,\n\n00:13:57.958 --> 00:13:59.958\nthe number of new albums and so on.\n\n00:14:00.958 --> 00:14:02.958\nThe only grain of truth to this\n\n00:14:02.958 --> 00:14:04.958\ncomplaint that the arts are in decline\n\n00:14:04.958 --> 00:14:08.958\ncome from three spheres.\n\n00:14:08.958 --> 00:14:11.958\nOne of them is in elite art since the 1930s --\n\n00:14:11.958 --> 00:14:13.958\nsay, the kinds of works performed\n\n00:14:13.958 --> 00:14:15.958\nby major symphony orchestras,\n\n00:14:15.958 --> 00:14:18.958\nwhere most of the repertory is before 1930,\n\n00:14:19.958 --> 00:14:21.958\nor the works shown in\n\n00:14:21.958 --> 00:14:24.958\nmajor galleries and prestigious museums.\n\n00:14:25.958 --> 00:14:27.958\nIn literary criticism and analysis,\n\n00:14:27.958 --> 00:14:29.958\nprobably 40 or 50 years ago,\n\n00:14:29.958 --> 00:14:32.958\nliterary critics were a kind of cultural hero;\n\n00:14:32.958 --> 00:14:34.958\nnow they're kind of a national joke.\n\n00:14:34.958 --> 00:14:37.958\nAnd the humanities and arts programs\n\n00:14:37.958 --> 00:14:39.958\nin the universities, which by many measures,\n\n00:14:39.958 --> 00:14:41.958\nindeed are in decline.\n\n00:14:41.958 --> 00:14:43.958\nStudents are staying away in droves,\n\n00:14:43.958 --> 00:14:45.958\nuniversities are disinvesting\n\n00:14:45.958 --> 00:14:47.958\nin the arts and humanities.\n\n00:14:47.958 --> 00:14:50.958\nWell, here's a diagnosis.\n\n00:14:50.958 --> 00:14:52.958\nThey didn't ask me, but by their own admission,\n\n00:14:52.958 --> 00:14:55.958\nthey need all the help that they can get.\n\n00:14:55.958 --> 00:14:57.958\nAnd I would like to suggest that it's not a coincidence\n\n00:14:57.958 --> 00:14:59.958\nthat this supposed decline\n\n00:14:59.958 --> 00:15:02.958\nin the elite arts and criticism\n\n00:15:02.958 --> 00:15:04.958\noccurred in the same point in history in which\n\n00:15:04.958 --> 00:15:07.958\nthere was a widespread denial of human nature.\n\n00:15:07.958 --> 00:15:09.958\nA famous quotation can be found --\n\n00:15:09.958 --> 00:15:11.958\nif you look on the web, you can find it in\n\n00:15:11.958 -->

nature changed.\"\n\n00:15:21.958 --> 00:15:24.958\nA paraphrase of a quote by Virginia Woolf,\n\n00:15:24.958 --> 00:15:26.958\nand there's some debate\n\n00:15:26.958 --> 00:15:28.958\nas to what she actually meant by that.\n\n00:15:28.958 --> 00:15:30.958\nBut it's very clear, looking at these syllabuses,\n\n00:15:30.958 --> 00:15:32.958\nthat -- it's used now\n\n00:15:32.958 --> 00:15:36.958\nas a way of saying that all forms\n\n00:15:36.958 --> 00:15:38.958\nof appreciation of art\n\n00:15:38.958 --> 00:15:42.958\nthat were in place for centuries, or millennia,\n\n00:15:42.958 --> 00:15:45.958\nin the 20th century were discarded.\n\n00:15:45.958 --> 00:15:47.958\nThe beauty and pleasure in art --\n\n00:15:47.958 --> 00:15:49.958\nprobably a human universal --\n\n00:15:49.958 --> 00:15:51.958\nwere -- began to be considered saccharine,\n\n00:15:51.958 --> 00:15:54.958\nor kitsch, or commercial.\n\n00:15:54.958 --> 00:15:57.958\nBarnett Newman had a famous quote that \"the impulse of modern art\n\n00:15:57.958 --> 00:16:00.958\nis the desire to destroy beauty\" --\n\n00:16:00.958 --> 00:16:03.958\nwhich was considered bourgeois or tacky.\n\n00:16:03.958 --> 00:16:05.958\nAnd here's just one example.\n\n00:16:05.958 --> 00:16:08.958\nI mean, this is perhaps a representative example\n\n00:16:08.958 --> 00:16:11.958\nof the visual depiction of the female form\n\n00:16:11.958 --> 00:16:13.958\nin the 15th century;\n\n00:16:13.958 --> 00:16:15.958\nhere is a representative example\n\n00:16:15.958 --> 00:16:18.958\nof the depiction of the female form in the 20th century.\n\n00:16:19.958 --> 00:16:21.958\nAnd, as you can see, there -- something has changed\n\n00:16:21.958 --> 00:16:23.958\nin the way the elite arts\n\n00:16:23.958 --> 00:16:25.958\nappeal to the senses.\n\n00:16:25.958 --> 00:16:27.958\nIndeed, in movements of modernism\n\n00:16:27.958 --> 00:16:29.958\nand post-modernism,\n\n00:16:29.958 --> 00:16:31.958\nthere was visual art without beauty,\n\n00:16:31.958 --> 00:16:33.958\nliterature without narrative and plot,\n\n00:16:33.958 --> 00:16:35.958\npoetry without meter and

00:16:42.958\nmusic without melody and rhythm,\n\n00:16:42.958 --> 00:16:44.958\nand criticism without clarity,\n\n00:16:44.958 --> 00:16:47.958\nattention to aesthetics and insight into the human

there -- one of the most famous literary\n\n00:16:54.958 --> 00:16:56.958\nEnglish scholars of our time\n\n00:16:56.958 --> 00:16:58.958\nis the Berkeley professor,\n\n00:16:58.958 --> 00:17:00.958\nJudith Butler.\n\n00:17:00.958 --> 00:17:02.958\nAnd here is an example of\n\n00:17:02.958 --> 00:17:05.958\none of her analyses:\n\n00:17:05.958 --> 00:17:07.958\n\"The move from a

question of temporality into the thinking of structure,\n\n00:17:19.958 --> 00:17:21.958\nand marked a shift from the form of Althusserian theory\n\n00:17:21.958 --> 00:17:24.958\nthat takes structural totalities as theoretical objects ...\"\n\n00:17:24.958 --> 00:17:27.958\nWell, you get the idea.\n\n00:17:27.958 --> 00:17:29.958\nBy the way, this is one sentence --\n\n00:17:29.958 --> 00:17:32.958\nyou can actually parse it.\n\n00:17:33.958 --> 00:17:35.958\nWell, the argument in \"The Blank Slate\"\n\n00:17:35.958 --> 00:17:37.958\nwas that elite art and criticism\n\n00:17:37.958 --> 00:17:39.958\nin the 20th century,\n\n00:17:39.958 --> 00:17:41.958\nalthough not the arts in general,\n\n00:17:41.958 --> 00:17:43.958\nhave disdained beauty, pleasure,\n\n00:17:43.958 --> 00:17:46.958\nclarity, insight and style.\n\n00:17:46.958 --> 00:17:49.958\nPeople are staying away from elite art and criticism.\n\n00:17:50.958 --> 00:17:52.958\nWhat a puzzle -- I wonder why.\n\n00:17:53.958 --> 00:17:55.958\nWell, this turned out to be probably\n\n00:17:55.958 --> 00:17:57.958\nthe most controversial claim in the book.\n\n00:17:57.958 --> 00:17:59.958\nSomeone asked me whether I stuck it in\n\n00:17:59.958 --> 00:18:02.958\nin order to deflect ire\n\n00:18:02.958 --> 00:18:04.958\nfrom discussions of gender and Nazism\n\n00:18:05.958 --> 00:18:08.958\nand race

I won't comment on that.\n\n00:18:09.958 --> 00:18:12.958\nBut it certainly inspired\n\n00:18:12.958 --> 00:18:15.958\nan energetic reaction\n\n00:18:15.958 --> 00:18:18.958\nfrom many university professors.\n\n00:18:18.958 --> 00:18:21.958\nWell, the other hot button is parenting.\n\n00:18:21.958 --> 00:18:24.958\nAnd the starting point is the -- for that discussion\n\n00:18:24.958 --> 00:18:26.958\nwas the fact that we have all\n\n00:18:26.958 --> 00:18:28.958\nbeen subject to the advice\n\n00:18:28.958 --> 00:18:31.958\nof the parenting industrial complex.\n\n00:18:31.958 --> 00:18:33.958\nNow, here is -- here is a\n\n00:18:33.958 --> 00:18:36.958\nrepresentative quote from a besieged mother:\n\n00:18:36.958 --> 00:18:38.958\n\"I'm overwhelmed with parenting advice.\n\n00:18:38.958 --> 00:18:40.958\nI'm supposed to do lots of physical activity with my kids\n\n00:18:40.958 --> 00:18:43.958\nso I can instill in them a physical fitness habit\n\n00:18:43.958 --> 00:18:45.958\nso they'll grow up to be healthy adults.\n\n00:18:45.958 --> 00:18:47.958\nAnd I'm supposed to do all kinds of intellectual play\n\n00:18:47.958 --> 00:18:49.958\nso they'll grow up smart.\n\n00:18:49.958 --> 00:18:52.958\nAnd there are all kinds of play -- clay for finger dexterity,\n\n00:18:52.958 --> 00:18:55.958\nword games for reading success, large motor play,\n\n00:18:55.958 --> 00:18:57.958\nsmall motor play. I feel like I could devote my life\n\n00:18:57.958 --> 00:19:00.958\nto figuring out what to play with my kids.\"\n\n00:19:00.958 --> 00:19:02.958\nI think anyone who's recently been a parent can sympathize\n\n00:19:02.958 --> 00:19:05.958\nwith this mother.\n\n00:19:05.958 --> 00:19:07.958\nWell, here's some sobering facts about parenting.\n\n00:19:08.958 --> 00:19:11.958\nMost studies of parenting on which this advice is based\n\n00:19:12.958 --> 00:19:15.958\nare useless. They're useless because they don't control\n\n00:19:15.958 --> 00:19:18.958\nfor heritability. They measure some correlation\n\n00:19:18.958 --> 00:19:21.958\nbetween what the parents do, how the children turn out\n\n00:19:21.958 --> 00:19:23.958\nand assume a causal relation:\n\n00:19:23.958 --> 00:19:25.958\nthat the parenting shaped the child.\n\n00:19:25.958 --> 00:19:27.958\nParents who talk a lot to their kids\n\n00:19:27.958 --> 00:19:29.958\nhave kids who grow up to be articulate,\n\n00:19:29.958 --> 00:19:31.958\nparents who spank their kids have kids who grow up\n\n00:19:31.958 --> 00:19:33.958\nto be violent and so on.\n\n00:19:33.958 --> 00:19:36.958\nAnd very few of them control for the possibility\n\n00:19:36.958 --> 00:19:39.958\nthat parents pass on genes for --\n\n00:19:39.958 --> 00:19:41.958\nthat increase the chances a child will be articulate\n\n00:19:41.958 --> 00:19:43.958\nor violent and so on.\n\n00:19:43.958 --> 00:19:46.958\nUntil the studies are redone with adoptive children,\n\n00:19:46.958 --> 00:19:48.958\nwho provide an environment\n\n00:19:48.958 --> 00:19:50.958\nbut not genes to their kids,\n\n00:19:50.958 --> 00:19:53.958\nwe have no way of knowing whether these conclusions are valid.\n\n00:19:53.958 --> 00:19:55.958\nThe genetically controlled studies\n\n00:19:55.958 --> 00:19:57.958\nhave some sobering results.\n\n00:19:57.958 --> 00:19:59.958\nRemember the Mallifert twins:\n\n00:19:59.958 --> 00:20:02.958\nseparated at birth, then they meet in the patent office --\n\n00:20:02.958 --> 00:20:04.958\nremarkably similar.\n\n00:20:04.958 --> 00:20:07.958\nWell, what would have happened if the Mallifert twins had grown up together?\n\n00:20:07.958 --> 00:20:10.958\nYou might think, well, then they'd be even more similar,\n\n00:20:10.958 --> 00:20:12.958\nbecause not only would they share their genes,\n\n00:20:12.958 --> 00:20:15.958\nbut they would also share their environment.\n\n00:20:15.958 --> 00:20:17.958\nThat would make them super-similar, right?\n\n00:20:17.958 --> 00:20:20.958\nWrong. Identical twins, or any siblings,\n\n00:20:20.958 --> 00:20:24.958\nwho are separated at birth are no less similar\n\n00:20:24.958 --> 00:20:26.958\nthan if they had grown up together.\n\n00:20:26.958 --> 00:20:28.958\nEverything that happens to you in a given home\n\n00:20:28.958 --> 00:20:30.958\nover all of those years\n\n00:20:30.958 --> 00:20:32.958\nappears to leave no permanent stamp\n\n00:20:32.958 --> 00:20:34.958\non your personality or intellect.\n\n00:20:35.958 --> 00:20:38.958\nA complementary finding, from a completely different methodology,\n\n00:20:38.958 --> 00:20:42.958\nis that adopted siblings reared together --\n\n00:20:42.958 --> 00:20:44.958\nthe mirror image of identical twins reared apart,\n\n00:20:44.958 --> 00:20:46.958\nthey share their parents, their home,\n\n00:20:46.958 --> 00:20:48.958\ntheir neighborhood,\n\n00:20:48.958 --> 00:20:51.958\ndon't share their genes -- end up not similar at all.\n\n00:20:51.958 --> 00:20:54.958\nOK -- two different bodies of research with a similar finding.\n\n00:20:54.958 --> 00:20:56.958\nWhat it suggests is that children are shaped\n\n00:20:56.958 --> 00:20:59.958\nnot by their parents over the long run,\n\n00:20:59.958 --> 00:21:02.958\nbut in part -- only in part -- by their genes,\n\n00:21:02.958 --> 00:21:04.958\nin part by their culture --\n\n00:21:04.958 --> 00:21:06.958\nthe culture of the country at large\n\n00:21:06.958 --> 00:21:08.958\nand the children's own culture, namely their peer group --\n\n00:21:08.958 --> 00:21:11.958\nas we heard from Jill Sobule earlier today,\n\n00:21:11.958 --> 00:21:13.958\nthat's what kids care about --\n\n00:21:14.958 --> 00:21:17.958\nand, to a very large extent, larger than most people are prepared to acknowledge,\n\n00:21:17.958 --> 00:21:20.958\nby chance: chance events in the wiring of the brain in utero;\n\n00:21:20.958 --> 00:21:22.958\nchance events as you live your life.\n\n00:21:24.958 --> 00:21:26.958\nSo let me conclude\n\n00:21:26.958 --> 00:21:28.958\nwith just a remark\n\n00:21:28.958 --> 00:21:31.958\nto bring it back to the theme of choices.\n\n00:21:31.958 --> 00:21:33.958\nI think that the sciences of human nature --\n\n00:21:33.958 --> 00:21:36.958\nbehavioral genetics, evolutionary psychology, \n\n\n00:21:36.958 --> 00:21:38.958\nneuroscience, cognitive science --\n\n00:21:38.958 --> 00:21:41.958\nare going to, increasingly in the years to come,\n\n00:21:41.958 --> 00:21:44.958\nupset various dogmas,\n\n00:21:44.958 --> 00:21:47.958\ncareers and deeply-held political belief systems.\n\n00:21:47.958 --> 00:21:49.958\nAnd that presents us with a choice.\n\n00:21:49.958 --> 00:21:52.958\nThe choice is whether certain facts about humans,\n\n00:21:52.958 --> 00:21:55.958\nor topics, are to be considered taboos,\n\n00:21:56.958 --> 00:21:58.958\nforbidden knowledge, where we shouldn't go there\n\n00:21:58.958 --> 00:22:00.958\nbecause no good can come from it,\n\n00:22:00.958 --> 00:22:03.958\nor whether we should explore them honestly.\n\n00:22:03.958 --> 00:22:05.958\nI have my own\n\n00:22:05.958 --> 00:22:07.958\nanswer to that question,\n\n00:22:07.958 --> 00:22:10.958\nwhich comes from a great artist of the 19th century,\n\n00:22:10.958 --> 00:22:13.958\nAnton Chekhov, who said,\n\n00:22:13.958 --> 00:22:15.958\n\"Man will become better when you show him\n\n00:22:15.958 --> 00:22:17.958\nwhat he is like.\"\n\n00:22:17.958 --> 00:22:19.958\nAnd I think that the argument\n\n00:22:19.958 --> 00:22:22.958\ncan't be put any more eloquently than that.\n\n00:22:22.958 --> 00:22:24.958\nThank you very much.\n\n00:22:25.958 --> 00:22:30.958\n(Applause)"}, {"title": "Robots will invade our lives", "duration": "1127", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/rodney_brooks_on_robots", "transcript": "What I want to tell you about today is how I see robots invading our lives at multiple levels, over multiple timescales. And when I look out in the future, I can't imagine a world, 500 years from now, where we don't have robots everywhere. Assuming \u2014 despite all the dire predictions from many people about our future \u2014 assuming we're still around, I can't imagine the world not being populated with robots. And then the question is, well, if they're going to be here in 500 years, are they going to be everywhere sooner than that? Are they going to be around in 50 years? Yeah, I think that's pretty likely \u2014 there's going to be lots of robots everywhere. And in fact I think that's going to be a lot sooner than that. I think we're sort of on the cusp of robots becoming common, and I think we're sort of around 1978 or 1980 in personal computer years, where the first few robots are starting to appear.Computers sort of came around through games and toys. And you know, the first computer most people had in the house may have been a computer to play Pong, a little microprocessor embedded, and then other games that came after that. And we're starting to see that same sort of thing with robots: LEGO Mindstorms, Furbies \u2014 who here \u2014 did anyone here have a Furby? Yeah, there's 38 million of them sold worldwide. They are pretty common. And they're a little tiny robot, a simple robot with some sensors, a little bit of processing actuation.On the right there is another robot doll, who you could get a couple of years ago. And just as in the early days, when there was a lot of sort of amateur interaction over computers, you can now get various hacking kits, how-to-hack books. And on the left there is a platform from Evolution Robotics, where you put a PC on, and you program this thing with a GUI to wander around your house and do various stuff. And then there's a higher price point sort of robot toys \u2014 the Sony Aibo. And on the right there, is one that the NEC developed, the PaPeRo, which I don't think they're going to release. But nevertheless, those sorts of things are out there.And we've seen, over the last two or three years, lawn-mowing robots, Husqvarna on the bottom, Friendly Robotics on top there, an Israeli company. And then in the last 12 months or so we've started to see a bunch of home-cleaning robots appear. The top left one is a very nice home-cleaning robot from a company called Dyson, in the U.K. Except it was so expensive \u2014 3,500 dollars \u2014 they didn't release it.But at the bottom left, you see Electrolux, which is on sale. Another one from Karcher. At the bottom right is one that I built in my lab about 10 years ago, and we finally turned that into a product. And let me just show you that. We're going to give this away I think, Chris said, after the talk. This is a robot that you can go out and buy, and that will clean up your floor. And it starts off sort of just going around in ever-increasing circles. If it hits something \u2014 you people see that? Now it's doing wall-following, it's following around my feet to clean up around me. Let's see, let's \u2014 oh, who stole my Rice Krispies? They stole my Rice Krispies! (Laughter) Don't worry, relax, no, relax, it's a robot, it's smart! (Laughter) See, the three-year-old kids, they don't worry about it. It's grown-ups that get really upset. (Laughter) We'll just put some crap here. (Laughter) Okay. (Laughter) I don't know if you see \u2014 so, I put a bunch of Rice Krispies there, I put some pennies, let's just shoot it at that, see if it cleans up. Yeah, OK. So \u2014 we'll leave that for later. (Applause)Part of the trick was building a better cleaning mechanism, actually; the intelligence on board was fairly simple. And that's true with a lot of robots. We've all, I think, become, sort of computational chauvinists, and think that computation is everything, but the mechanics still matter. Here's another robot, the PackBot, that we've been building for a bunch of years. It's a military surveillance robot, to go in ahead of troops \u2014 looking at caves, for instance. But we had to make it fairly robust, much more robust than the robots we build in our labs. (Laughter) On board that robot is a PC running Linux. It can withstand a 400G shock. The robot has local intelligence: it can flip itself over, can get itself into communication range, can go upstairs by itself, et cetera. Okay, so it's doing local navigation there. A soldier gives it a command to go upstairs, and it does. That was not a controlled descent. (Laughter) Now it's going to head off. And the big breakthrough for these robots, really, was September 11th. We had the robots down at the World Trade Center late that evening. Couldn't do a lot in the main rubble pile, things were just too \u2014 there was nothing left to do. But we did go into all the surrounding buildings that had been evacuated, and searched for possible survivors in the buildings that were too dangerous to go into. Let's run this video. Reporter: ...battlefield companions are helping to reduce the combat risks. Nick Robertson has that story. Rodney Brooks: Can we have another one of these? Okay, good. So, this is a corporal who had seen a robot two weeks previously. He's sending robots into caves, looking at what's going on. The robot's being totally autonomous. The worst thing that's happened in the cave so far was one of the robots fell down ten meters.So one year ago, the US military didn't have these robots. Now they're on active duty in Afghanistan every day. And that's one of the reasons they say a robot invasion is happening. There's a sea change happening in how \u2014 where technology's going. Thanks. And over the next couple of months, we're going to be sending robots in production down producing oil wells to get that last few years of oil out of the ground. Very hostile environments, 150\u02da C, 10,000 PSI. Autonomous robots going down, doing this sort of work. But robots like this, they're a little hard to program. How, in the future, are we going to program our robots and make them easier to use? And I want to actually use a robot here \u2014 a robot named Chris \u2014 stand up. Yeah. Okay. Come over here. Now notice, he thinks robots have to be a bit stiff. He sort of does that. But I'm going to \u2014 Chris Anderson: I'm just British. RB: Oh. (Laughter) (Applause) I'm going to show this robot a task. It's a very complex task. Now notice, he nodded there, he was giving me some indication he was understanding the flow of communication. And if I'd said something completely bizarre he would have looked askance at me, and regulated the conversation. So now I brought this up in front of him. I'd looked at his eyes, and I saw his eyes looked at this bottle top. And I'm doing this task here, and he's checking up. His eyes are going back and forth up to me, to see what I'm looking at \u2014 so we've got shared attention. And so I do this task, and he looks, and he looks to me to see what's happening next. And now I'll give him the bottle, and we'll see if he can do the task. Can you do that? (Laughter) Okay. He's pretty good. Yeah. Good, good, good. I didn't show you how to do that. Now see if you can put it back together. (Laughter) And he thinks a robot has to be really slow. Good robot, that's good.So we saw a bunch of things there. We saw when we're interacting, we're trying to show someone how to do something, we direct their visual attention. The other thing communicates their internal state to us, whether he's understanding or not, regulates a social interaction. There was shared attention looking at the same sort of thing, and recognizing socially communicated reinforcement at the end. And we've been trying to put that into our lab robots because we think this is how you're going to want to interact with robots in the future. I just want to show you one technical diagram here. The most important thing for building a robot that you can interact with socially is its visual attention system. Because what it pays attention to is what it's seeing and interacting with, and what you're understanding what it's doing. So in the videos I'm about to show you, you're going to see a visual attention system on a robot which has \u2014 it looks for skin tone in HSV space, so it works across all human colorings. It looks for highly saturated colors, from toys. And it looks for things that move around. And it weights those together into an attention window, and it looks for the highest-scoring place \u2014 the stuff where the most interesting stuff is happening \u2014 and that is what its eyes then segue to. And it looks right at that. At the same time, some top-down sort of stuff: might decide that it's lonely and look for skin tone, or might decide that it's bored and look for a toy to play with. And so these weights change.And over here on the right, this is what we call the Steven Spielberg memorial module. Did people see the movie \"AI\"? (Audience: Yes.)RB: Yeah, it was really bad, but \u2014remember, especially when Haley Joel Osment, the little robot, looked at the blue fairy for 2,000 years without taking his eyes off it? Well, this gets rid of that, because this is a habituation Gaussian that gets negative, and more and more intense as it looks at one thing. And it gets bored, so it will then look away at something else. So, once you've got that \u2014 and here's a robot, here's Kismet, looking around for a toy. You can tell what it's looking at. You can estimate its gaze direction from those eyeballs covering its camera, and you can tell when it's actually seeing the toy. And it's got a little bit of an emotional response here. (Laughter) But it's still going to pay attention if something more significant comes into its field of view \u2014 such as Cynthia Breazeal, the builder of this robot, from the right. It sees her, pays attention to her. Kismet has an underlying, three-dimensional emotional space, a vector space, of where it is emotionally. And at different places in that space, it expresses \u2014 can we have the volume on here? Can you hear that now, out there? (Audience: Yeah.)Kismet: Do you really think so? Do you really think so? Do you really think so?RB: So it's expressing its emotion through its face and the prosody in its voice. And when I was dealing with my robot over here, Chris, the robot, was measuring the prosody in my voice, and so we have the robot measure prosody for four basic messages that mothers give their children pre-linguistically. Here we've got naive subjects praising the robot:Voice: Nice robot. You're such a cute little robot. (Laughter) RB: And the robot's reacting appropriately.Voice: ...very good, Kismet. (Laughter)Voice: Look at my smile.RB: It smiles. She imitates the smile. This happens a lot. These are naive subjects. Here we asked them to get the robot's attention and indicate when they have the robot's attention.Voice: Hey, Kismet, ah, there it is.RB: So she realizes she has the robot's attention. Voice: Kismet, do you like the toy? Oh.RB: Now, here they're asked to prohibit the robot, and this first woman really pushes the robot into an emotional corner.Voice: No. No. You're not to do that. No. (Laughter)Not appropriate. No. No. (Laughter)RB: I'm going to leave it at that.We put that together. Then we put in turn taking. When we talk to someone, we talk. Then we sort of raise our eyebrows, move our eyes, give the other person the idea it's their turn to talk. And then they talk, and then we pass the baton back and forth between each other. So we put this in the robot. We got a bunch of naive subjects in, we didn't tell them anything about the robot, sat them down in front of the robot and said, talk to the robot. Now what they didn't know was, the robot wasn't understanding a word they said, and that the robot wasn't speaking English. It was just saying random English phonemes. And I want you to watch carefully, at the beginning of this, where this person, Ritchie, who happened to talk to the robot for 25 minutes \u2014 (Laughter) \u2014 says, \"I want to show you something. I want to show you my watch.\" And he brings the watch center, into the robot's field of vision, points to it, gives it a motion cue, and the robot looks at the watch quite successfully. We don't know whether he understood or not that the robot \u2014 Notice the turn-taking. Ritchie: OK, I want to show you something. OK, this is a watch that my girlfriend gave me. Robot: Oh, cool. Ritchie: Yeah, look, it's got a little blue light in it too. I almost lost it this week. (Laughter) RB: So it's making eye contact with him, following his eyes. Ritchie: Can you do the same thing? Robot: Yeah, sure. RB: And they successfully have that sort of communication.And here's another aspect of the sorts of things that Chris and I were doing. This is another robot, Cog. They first make eye contact, and then, when Christie looks over at this toy, the robot estimates her gaze direction and looks at the same thing that she's looking at. (Laughter) So we're going to see more and more of this sort of robot over the next few years in labs. But then the big questions, two big questions that people ask me are: if we make these robots more and more human-like, will we accept them, will we \u2014 will they need rights eventually? And the other question people ask me is, will they want to take over? (Laughter) And on the first \u2014 you know, this has been a very Hollywood theme with lots of movies. You probably recognize these characters here \u2014 where in each of these cases, the robots want more respect. Well, do you ever need to give robots respect? They're just machines, after all. But I think, you know, we have to accept that we are just machines. After all, that's certainly what modern molecular biology says about us. You don't see a description of how, you know, Molecule A, you know, comes up and docks with this other molecule. And it's moving forward, you know, propelled by various charges, and then the soul steps in and tweaks those molecules so that they connect. It's all mechanistic. We are mechanism. If we are machines, then in principle at least, we should be able to build machines out of other stuff, which are just as alive as we are. But I think for us to admit that, we have to give up on our special-ness, in a certain way. And we've had the retreat from special-ness under the barrage of science and technology many times over the last few hundred years, at least. 500 years ago we had to give up the idea that we are the center of the universe when the earth started to go around the sun; 150 years ago, with Darwin, we had to give up the idea we were different from animals. And to imagine \u2014 you know, it's always hard for us. Recently we've been battered with the idea that maybe we didn't even have our own creation event, here on earth, which people didn't like much. And then the human genome said, maybe we only have 35,000 genes. And that was really \u2014 people didn't like that, we've got more genes than that. We don't like to give up our special-ness, so, you know, having the idea that robots could really have emotions, or that robots could be living creatures \u2014 I think is going to be hard for us to accept. But we're going to come to accept it over the next 50 years or so.And the second question is, will the machines want to take over? And here the standard scenario is that we create these things, they grow, we nurture them, they learn a lot from us, and then they start to decide that we're pretty boring, slow. They want to take over from us. And for those of you that have teenagers, you know what that's like. (Laughter) But Hollywood extends it to the robots. And the question is, you know, will someone accidentally build a robot that takes over from us? And that's sort of like this lone guy in the backyard, you know \u2014 \"I accidentally built a 747.\" I don't think that's going to happen. And I don't think \u2014 (Laughter) \u2014 I don't think we're going to deliberately build robots that we're uncomfortable with. We'll \u2014 you know, they're not going to have a super bad robot. Before that has to come to be a mildly bad robot, and before that a not so bad robot. (Laughter) And we're just not going to let it go that way. (Laughter) So, I think I'm going to leave it at that: the robots are coming, we don't have too much to worry about, it's going to be a lot of fun, and I hope you all enjoy the journey over the next 50 years.

And they're a little tiny robot,\n\n00:01:26.958 --> 00:01:28.958\na simple robot with some sensors,\n\n00:01:28.958 --> 00:01:30.958\na little bit of processing actuation.\n\n00:01:30.958 --> 00:01:33.958\nOn the right there is another robot doll, who you could get a couple of years ago.\n\n00:01:33.958 --> 00:01:35.958\nAnd just as in the early days,\n\n00:01:35.958 --> 00:01:40.958\nwhen there was a lot of sort of amateur interaction over computers,\n\n00:01:40.958 --> 00:01:44.958\nyou can now get various hacking kits, how-to-hack books.\n\n00:01:44.958 --> 00:01:48.958\nAnd on the left there is a platform from Evolution Robotics,\n\n00:01:48.958 --> 00:01:51.958\nwhere you put a PC on, and you program this thing with a GUI\n\n00:01:51.958 --> 00:01:54.958\nto wander around your house and do various stuff.\n\n00:01:54.958 --> 00:01:57.958\nAnd then there's a higher price point sort of robot toys --\n\n00:01:57.958 --> 00:02:01.958\nthe Sony Aibo. And on the right there, is one that the NEC developed,\n\n00:02:01.958 --> 00:02:04.958\nthe PaPeRo, which I don't think they're going to release.\n\n00:02:04.958 --> 00:02:07.958\nBut nevertheless, those sorts of things are out there.\n\n00:02:07.958 --> 00:02:11.958\nAnd we've seen, over the last two or three years, lawn-mowing robots,\n\n00:02:11.958 --> 00:02:17.958\nHusqvarna on the bottom, Friendly Robotics on top there, an Israeli company.\n\n00:02:17.958 --> 00:02:19.958\nAnd then in the last 12 months or so\n\n00:02:19.958 --> 00:02:23.958\nwe've started to see a bunch of home-cleaning robots appear.\n\n00:02:23.958 --> 00:02:26.958\nThe top left one is a very nice home-cleaning robot\n\n00:02:26.958 --> 00:02:30.958\nfrom a company called Dyson, in the U.K. Except it was so expensive --\n\n00:02:30.958 --> 00:02:32.958\n3,500 dollars -- they didn't release it.\n\n00:02:32.958 --> 00:02:35.958\nBut at the bottom left, you see Electrolux, which is on sale.\n\n00:02:35.958 --> 00:02:37.958\nAnother one from Karcher.\n\n00:02:37.958 --> 00:02:39.958\nAt the bottom right is one that I built in my lab\n\n00:02:39.958 --> 00:02:42.958\nabout 10 years ago, and we finally turned that into a product.\n\n00:02:42.958 --> 00:02:44.958\nAnd let me just show you that.\n\n00:02:44.958 --> 00:02:48.958\nWe're going to give this away I think, Chris said, after the talk.\n\n00:02:48.958 --> 00:02:54.958\nThis is a robot that you can go out and buy, and that will clean up your floor.\n\n00:02:58.958 --> 00:03:03.958\nAnd it starts off sort of just going around in ever-increasing circles.\n\n00:03:03.958 --> 00:03:07.958\nIf it hits something -- you people see that?\n\n00:03:07.958 --> 00:03:10.958\nNow it's doing wall-following, it's following around my feet\n\n00:03:10.958 --> 00:03:14.958\nto clean up around me. Let's see, let's --\n\n00:03:14.958 --> 00:03:19.958\noh, who stole my Rice Krispies? They stole my Rice Krispies!\n\n00:03:19.958 --> 00:03:25.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:03:25.958 --> 00:03:28.958\nDon't worry, relax, no, relax, it's a robot, it's smart!\n\n00:03:28.958 --> 00:03:31.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:03:31.958 --> 00:03:35.958\nSee, the three-year-old kids, they don't worry about it.\n\n00:03:35.958 --> 00:03:37.958\nIt's grown-ups that get really upset.\n\n00:03:37.958 --> 00:03:38.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:03:38.958 --> 00:03:40.958\nWe'll just put some crap here.\n\n00:03:40.958 --> 00:03:44.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:03:44.958 --> 00:03:46.958\nOkay.\n\n00:03:46.958 --> 00:03:50.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:03:50.958 --> 00:03:53.958\nI don't know if you see -- so, I put a bunch of Rice Krispies there,\n\n00:03:53.958 --> 00:04:00.958\nI put some pennies, let's just shoot it at that, see if it cleans up.\n\n00:04:03.958 --> 00:04:05.958\nYeah, OK. So --\n\n00:04:05.958 --> 00:04:09.958\nwe'll leave that for later.\n\n00:04:09.958 --> 00:04:14.958\n(Applause)\n\n00:04:15.958 --> 00:04:19.958\nPart of the trick was building a better cleaning mechanism, actually;\n\n00:04:19.958 --> 00:04:23.958\nthe intelligence on board was fairly simple.\n\n00:04:23.958 --> 00:04:25.958\nAnd that's true with a lot of robots.\n\n00:04:25.958 --> 00:04:29.958\nWe've all, I think, become, sort of computational chauvinists,\n\n00:04:29.958 --> 00:04:31.958\nand think that computation is everything,\n\n00:04:31.958 --> 00:04:33.958\nbut the mechanics still matter.\n\n00:04:33.958 --> 00:04:36.958\nHere's another robot, the PackBot,\n\n00:04:36.958 --> 00:04:38.958\nthat we've been building for a bunch of years.\n\n00:04:38.958 --> 00:04:44.958\nIt's a military surveillance robot, to go in ahead of troops --\n\n00:04:44.958 --> 00:04:47.958\nlooking at caves, for instance.\n\n00:04:47.958 --> 00:04:49.958\nBut we had to make it fairly robust,\n\n00:04:49.958 --> 00:04:56.958\nmuch more robust than the robots we build in our labs.\n\n00:04:56.958 --> 00:04:59.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:05:05.958 --> 00:05:09.958\nOn board that robot is a PC running Linux.\n\n00:05:09.958 --> 00:05:15.958\nIt can withstand a 400G shock. The robot has local intelligence:\n\n00:05:15.958 --> 00:05:21.958\nit can flip itself over, can get itself into communication range,\n\n00:05:21.958 --> 00:05:24.958\ncan go upstairs by itself, et cetera.\n\n00:05:31.958 --> 00:05:35.958\nOkay, so it's doing local navigation there.\n\n00:05:35.958 --> 00:05:41.958\nA soldier gives it a command to go upstairs, and it does.\n\n00:05:42.958 --> 00:05:45.958\nThat was not a controlled descent.\n\n00:05:45.958 --> 00:05:47.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:05:47.958 --> 00:05:49.958\nNow it's going to head off.\n\n00:05:49.958 --> 00:05:54.958\nAnd the big breakthrough for these robots, really, was September 11th.\n\n00:05:54.958 --> 00:05:58.958\nWe had the robots down at the World Trade Center late that evening.\n\n00:05:59.958 --> 00:06:01.958\nCouldn't do a lot in the main rubble pile,\n\n00:06:01.958 --> 00:06:04.958\nthings were just too -- there was nothing left to do.\n\n00:06:04.958 --> 00:06:09.958\nBut we did go into all the surrounding buildings that had been evacuated,\n\n00:06:09.958 --> 00:06:12.958\nand searched for possible survivors in the buildings\n\n00:06:12.958 --> 00:06:14.958\nthat were too dangerous to go into.\n\n00:06:14.958 --> 00:06:16.958\nLet's run this video.\n\n00:06:16.958 --> 00:06:19.958\nReporter: ...battlefield companions are helping to reduce the combat risks.\n\n00:06:19.958 --> 00:06:22.958\nNick Robertson has that story.\n\n00:06:24.958 --> 00:06:26.958\nRodney Brooks: Can we have another one of these?\n\n00:06:31.958 --> 00:06:33.958\nOkay, good.\n\n00:06:36.958 --> 00:06:39.958\nSo, this is a corporal who had seen a robot two weeks previously.\n\n00:06:41.958 --> 00:06:45.958\nHe's sending robots into caves, looking at what's going on.\n\n00:06:45.958 --> 00:06:47.958\nThe robot's being totally autonomous.\n\n00:06:47.958 --> 00:06:51.958\nThe worst thing that's happened in the cave so far\n\n00:06:51.958 --> 00:06:54.958\nwas one of the robots fell down ten meters.\n\n00:07:01.958 --> 00:07:04.958\nSo one year ago, the US military didn't have these robots.\n\n00:07:04.958 --> 00:07:06.958\nNow they're on active duty in Afghanistan every day.\n\n00:07:06.958 --> 00:07:09.958\nAnd that's one of the reasons they say a robot invasion is happening.\n\n00:07:09.958 --> 00:07:13.958\nThere's a sea change happening in how -- where technology's going.\n\n00:07:13.958 --> 00:07:15.958\nThanks.\n\n00:07:16.958 --> 00:07:18.958\nAnd over the next couple of months,\n\n00:07:18.958 --> 00:07:21.958\nwe're going to be sending robots in production\n\n00:07:21.958 --> 00:07:25.958\ndown producing oil wells to get that last few years of oil out of the ground.\n\n00:07:25.958 --> 00:07:29.958\nVery hostile environments, 150\u02da C, 10,000 PSI.\n\n00:07:29.958 --> 00:07:33.958\nAutonomous robots going down, doing this sort of work.\n\n00:07:33.958 --> 00:07:36.958\nBut robots like this, they're a little hard to program.\n\n00:07:36.958 --> 00:07:38.958\nHow, in the future, are we going to program our robots\n\n00:07:38.958 --> 00:07:40.958\nand make them easier to use?\n\n00:07:40.958 --> 00:07:43.958\nAnd I want to actually use a robot here --\n\n00:07:43.958 --> 00:07:48.958\na robot named Chris -- stand up. Yeah. Okay.\n\n00:07:50.958 --> 00:07:54.958\nCome over here. Now notice, he thinks robots have to be a bit stiff.\n\n00:07:54.958 --> 00:07:57.958\nHe sort of does that. But I'm going to --\n\n00:07:57.958 --> 00:07:59.958\nChris Anderson: I'm just British. RB: Oh.\n\n00:07:59.958 --> 00:08:01.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:08:01.958 --> 00:08:03.958\n(Applause)\n\n00:08:03.958 --> 00:08:06.958\nI'm going to show this robot a task. It's a very complex task.\n\n00:08:06.958 --> 00:08:09.958\nNow notice, he nodded there, he was giving me some indication\n\n00:08:09.958 --> 00:08:12.958\nhe was understanding the flow of communication.\n\n00:08:12.958 --> 00:08:14.958\nAnd if I'd said something completely bizarre\n\n00:08:14.958 --> 00:08:17.958\nhe would have looked askance at me, and regulated the conversation.\n\n00:08:17.958 --> 00:08:20.958\nSo now I brought this up in front of him.\n\n00:08:20.958 --> 00:08:24.958\nI'd looked at his eyes, and I saw his eyes looked at this bottle top.\n\n00:08:24.958 --> 00:08:26.958\nAnd I'm doing this task here, and he's checking up.\n\n00:08:26.958 --> 00:08:29.958\nHis eyes are going back and forth up to me, to see what I'm looking at --\n\n00:08:29.958 --> 00:08:31.958\nso we've got shared attention.\n\n00:08:31.958 --> 00:08:34.958\nAnd so I do this task, and he looks, and he looks to me\n\n00:08:34.958 --> 00:08:38.958\nto see what's happening next. And now I'll give him the bottle,\n\n00:08:38.958 --> 00:08:40.958\nand we'll see if he can do the task. Can you do that?\n\n00:08:40.958 --> 00:08:43.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:08:43.958 --> 00:08:47.958\nOkay. He's pretty good. Yeah. Good, good, good.\n\n00:08:47.958 --> 00:08:49.958\nI didn't show you how to do that.\n\n00:08:49.958 --> 00:08:51.958\nNow see if you can put it back together.\n\n00:08:51.958 --> 00:08:53.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:08:53.958 --> 00:08:54.958\nAnd he thinks a robot has to be really slow.\n\n00:08:54.958 --> 00:08:56.958\nGood robot, that's good.\n\n00:08:56.958 --> 00:08:58.958\nSo we saw a bunch of things there.\n\n00:08:59.958 --> 00:09:02.958\nWe saw when we're interacting,\n\n00:09:02.958 --> 00:09:06.958\nwe're trying to show someone how to do something, we direct their visual attention.\n\n00:09:06.958 --> 00:09:10.958\nThe other thing communicates their internal state to us,\n\n00:09:10.958 --> 00:09:13.958\nwhether he's understanding or not, regulates a social interaction.\n\n00:09:13.958 --> 00:09:15.958\nThere was shared attention looking at the same sort of thing,\n\n00:09:15.958 --> 00:09:19.958\nand recognizing socially communicated reinforcement at the end.\n\n00:09:19.958 --> 00:09:22.958\nAnd we've been trying to put that into our lab robots\n\n00:09:22.958 --> 00:09:26.958\nbecause we think this is how you're going to want to interact with robots in the future.\n\n00:09:26.958 --> 00:09:28.958\nI just want to show you one technical diagram here.\n\n00:09:28.958 --> 00:09:32.958\nThe most important thing for building a robot that you can interact with socially\n\n00:09:32.958 --> 00:09:34.958\nis its visual attention system.\n\n00:09:34.958 --> 00:09:37.958\nBecause what it pays attention to is what it's seeing\n\n00:09:37.958 --> 00:09:40.958\nand interacting with, and what you're understanding what it's doing.\n\n00:09:40.958 --> 00:09:43.958\nSo in the videos I'm about to show you,\n\n00:09:43.958 --> 00:09:47.958\nyou're going to see a visual attention system on a robot\n\n00:09:47.958 --> 00:09:51.958\nwhich has -- it looks for skin tone in HSV space,\n\n00:09:51.958 --> 00:09:55.958\nso it works across all human colorings.\n\n00:09:55.958 --> 00:09:57.958\nIt looks for highly saturated colors, from toys.\n\n00:09:57.958 --> 00:09:59.958\nAnd it looks for things that move around.\n\n00:09:59.958 --> 00:10:02.958\nAnd it weights those together into an attention window,\n\n00:10:02.958 --> 00:10:04.958\nand it looks for the highest-scoring place --\n\n00:10:04.958 --> 00:10:06.958\nthe stuff where the most interesting stuff is happening --\n\n00:10:06.958 --> 00:10:10.958\nand that is what its eyes then segue to.\n\n00:10:10.958 --> 00:10:12.958\nAnd it looks right at that.\n\n00:10:12.958 --> 00:10:15.958\nAt the same time, some top-down sort of stuff:\n\n00:10:15.958 --> 00:10:18.958\nmight decide that it's lonely and look for skin tone,\n\n00:10:18.958 --> 00:10:21.958\nor might decide that it's bored and look for a toy to play with.\n\n00:10:21.958 --> 00:10:23.958\nAnd so these weights change.\n\n00:10:23.958 --> 00:10:25.958\nAnd over here on the right,\n\n00:10:25.958 --> 00:10:28.958\nthis is what we call the Steven Spielberg memorial module.\n\n00:10:28.958 --> 00:10:30.958\nDid people see the movie \"AI\"? (Audience: Yes.)\n\n00:10:30.958 --> 00:10:32.958\nRB: Yeah, it was really bad, but --\n\n00:10:32.958 --> 00:10:36.958\nremember, especially when Haley Joel Osment, the little robot,\n\n00:10:36.958 --> 00:10:40.958\nlooked at the blue fairy for 2,000 years without taking his eyes off it?\n\n00:10:40.958 --> 00:10:42.958\nWell, this gets rid of that,\n\n00:10:42.958 --> 00:10:46.958\nbecause this is a habituation Gaussian that gets negative,\n\n00:10:46.958 --> 00:10:49.958\nand more and more intense as it looks at one thing.\n\n00:10:49.958 --> 00:10:52.958\nAnd it gets bored, so it will then look away at something else.\n\n00:10:52.958 --> 00:10:56.958\nSo, once you've got that -- and here's a robot, here's Kismet,\n\n00:10:56.958 --> 00:11:00.958\nlooking around for a toy. You can tell what it's looking at.\n\n00:11:00.958 --> 00:11:05.958\nYou can estimate its gaze direction from those eyeballs covering its camera,\n\n00:11:05.958 --> 00:11:08.958\nand you can tell when it's actually seeing the toy.\n\n00:11:08.958 --> 00:11:10.958\nAnd it's got a little bit of an emotional response here.\n\n00:11:10.958 --> 00:11:11.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:11:11.958 --> 00:11:13.958\nBut it's still going to pay attention\n\n00:11:13.958 --> 00:11:17.958\nif something more significant comes into its field of view --\n\n00:11:17.958 --> 00:11:21.958\nsuch as Cynthia Breazeal, the builder of this robot, from the right.\n\n00:11:21.958 --> 00:11:26.958\nIt sees her, pays attention to her.\n\n00:11:26.958 --> 00:11:30.958\nKismet has an underlying, three-dimensional emotional space,\n\n00:11:30.958 --> 00:11:33.958\na vector space, of where it is emotionally.\n\n00:11:33.958 --> 00:11:38.958\nAnd at different places in that space, it expresses --\n\n00:11:39.958 --> 00:11:41.958\ncan we have the volume on here?\n\n00:11:41.958 --> 00:11:43.958\nCan you hear that now, out there? (Audience: Yeah.)\n\n00:11:43.958 --> 00:11:48.958\nKismet: Do you really think so? Do you really think so?\n\n00:11:50.958 --> 00:11:52.958\nDo you really think so?\n\n00:11:53.958 --> 00:11:56.958\nRB: So it's expressing its emotion through its face\n\n00:11:56.958 --> 00:11:58.958\nand the prosody in its voice.\n\n00:11:58.958 --> 00:12:02.958\nAnd when I was dealing with my robot over here,\n\n00:12:02.958 --> 00:12:05.958\nChris, the robot, was measuring the prosody in my voice,\n\n00:12:05.958 --> 00:12:10.958\nand so we have the robot measure prosody for four basic messages\n\n00:12:10.958 --> 00:12:14.958\nthat mothers give their children pre-linguistically.\n\n00:12:14.958 --> 00:12:17.958\nHere we've got naive subjects praising the robot:\n\n00:12:19.958 --> 00:12:21.958\nVoice: Nice robot.\n\n00:12:22.958 --> 00:12:24.958\nYou're such a cute little robot.\n\n00:12:24.958 --> 00:12:26.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:12:26.958 --> 00:12:28.958\nRB: And the robot's reacting appropriately.\n\n00:12:28.958 --> 00:12:32.958\nVoice: ...very good, Kismet.\n\n00:12:33.958 --> 00:12:35.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:12:35.958 --> 00:12:37.958\nVoice: Look at my smile.\n\n00:12:39.958 --> 00:12:42.958\nRB: It smiles. She imitates the smile. This happens a lot.\n\n00:12:42.958 --> 00:12:44.958\nThese are naive subjects.\n\n00:12:44.958 --> 00:12:47.958\nHere we asked them to get the robot's attention\n\n00:12:47.958 --> 00:12:50.958\nand indicate when they have the robot's attention.\n\n00:12:50.958 --> 00:12:54.958\nVoice: Hey, Kismet, ah, there it is.\n\n00:12:54.958 --> 00:12:58.958\nRB: So she realizes she has the robot's attention.\n\n00:13:01.958 --> 00:13:05.958\nVoice: Kismet, do you like the toy? Oh.\n\n00:13:06.958 --> 00:13:08.958\nRB: Now, here they're asked to prohibit the robot,\n\n00:13:08.958 --> 00:13:12.958\nand this first woman really pushes the robot into an emotional corner.\n\n00:13:12.958 --> 00:13:17.958\nVoice: No. No. You're not to do that. No.\n\n00:13:17.958 --> 00:13:20.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:13:20.958 --> 00:13:26.958\nNot appropriate. No. No.\n\n00:13:26.958 --> 00:13:29.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:13:29.958 --> 00:13:31.958\nRB: I'm going to leave it at that.\n\n00:13:31.958 --> 00:13:33.958\nWe put that together. Then we put in turn taking.\n\n00:13:33.958 --> 00:13:36.958\nWhen we talk to someone, we talk.\n\n00:13:36.958 --> 00:13:40.958\nThen we sort of raise our eyebrows, move our eyes,\n\n00:13:40.958 --> 00:13:43.958\ngive the other person the idea it's their turn to talk.\n\n00:13:43.958 --> 00:13:47.958\nAnd then they talk, and then we pass the baton back and forth between each other.\n\n00:13:47.958 --> 00:13:49.958\nSo we put this in the robot.\n\n00:13:49.958 --> 00:13:51.958\nWe got a bunch of naive subjects in,\n\n00:13:51.958 --> 00:13:53.958\nwe didn't tell them anything about the robot,\n\n00:13:53.958 --> 00:13:55.958\nsat them down in front of the robot and said, talk to the robot.\n\n00:13:55.958 --> 00:13:57.958\nNow what they didn't know was,\n\n00:13:57.958 --> 00:13:59.958\nthe robot wasn't understanding a word they said,\n\n00:13:59.958 --> 00:14:02.958\nand that the robot wasn't speaking English.\n\n00:14:02.958 --> 00:14:04.958\nIt was just saying random English phonemes.\n\n00:14:04.958 --> 00:14:06.958\nAnd I want you to watch carefully, at the beginning of this,\n\n00:14:06.958 --> 00:14:10.958\nwhere this person, Ritchie, who happened to talk to the robot for 25 minutes --\n\n00:14:10.958 --> 00:14:12.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:14:12.958 --> 00:14:14.958\n-- says, \"I want to show you something.\n\n00:14:14.958 --> 00:14:16.958\nI want to show you my watch.\"\n\n00:14:16.958 --> 00:14:21.958\nAnd he brings the watch center, into the robot's field of vision,\n\n00:14:21.958 --> 00:14:23.958\npoints to it, gives it a motion cue,\n\n00:14:23.958 --> 00:14:25.958\nand the robot looks at the watch quite successfully.\n\n00:14:25.958 --> 00:14:28.958\nWe don't know whether he understood or not that the robot --\n\n00:14:29.958 --> 00:14:31.958\nNotice the turn-taking.\n\n00:14:31.958 --> 00:14:34.958\nRitchie: OK, I want to show you something. OK, this is a watch\n\n00:14:34.958 --> 00:14:37.958\nthat my girlfriend gave me.\n\n00:14:37.958 --> 00:14:39.958\nRobot: Oh, cool.\n\n00:14:39.958 --> 00:14:43.958\nRitchie: Yeah, look, it's got a little blue light in it too. I almost lost it this week.\n\n00:14:44.958 --> 00:14:48.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:14:48.958 --> 00:14:51.958\nRB: So it's making eye contact with him, following his eyes.\n\n00:14:51.958 --> 00:14:53.958\nRitchie: Can you do the same thing? Robot: Yeah, sure.\n\n00:14:53.958 --> 00:14:55.958\nRB: And they successfully have that sort of communication.\n\n00:14:55.958 --> 00:14:59.958\nAnd here's another aspect of the sorts of things that Chris and I were doing.\n\n00:14:59.958 --> 00:15:01.958\nThis is another robot, Cog.\n\n00:15:01.958 --> 00:15:07.958\nThey first make eye contact, and then, when Christie looks over at this toy,\n\n00:15:07.958 --> 00:15:09.958\nthe robot estimates her gaze direction\n\n00:15:09.958 --> 00:15:11.958\nand looks at the same thing that she's looking at.\n\n00:15:11.958 --> 00:15:12.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:15:12.958 --> 00:15:15.958\nSo we're going to see more and more of this sort of robot\n\n00:15:15.958 --> 00:15:17.958\nover the next few years in labs.\n\n00:15:17.958 --> 00:15:22.958\nBut then the big questions, two big questions that people ask me are:\n\n00:15:22.958 --> 00:15:24.958\nif we make these robots more and more human-like,\n\n00:15:24.958 --> 00:15:29.958\nwill we accept them, will we -- will they need rights eventually?\n\n00:15:29.958 --> 00:15:32.958\nAnd the other question people ask me is, will they want to take over?\n\n00:15:32.958 --> 00:15:33.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:15:33.958 --> 00:15:36.958\nAnd on the first -- you know, this has been a very Hollywood theme\n\n00:15:36.958 --> 00:15:39.958\nwith lots of movies. You probably recognize these characters here --\n\n00:15:39.958 --> 00:15:43.958\nwhere in each of these cases, the robots want more respect.\n\n00:15:43.958 --> 00:15:46.958\nWell, do you ever need to give robots respect?\n\n00:15:47.958 --> 00:15:49.958\nThey're just machines, after all.\n\n00:15:49.958 --> 00:15:53.958\nBut I think, you know, we have to accept that we are just machines.\n\n00:15:53.958 --> 00:15:58.958\nAfter all, that's certainly what modern molecular biology says about us.\n\n00:15:58.958 --> 00:16:01.958\nYou don't see a description of how, you know,\n\n00:16:01.958 --> 00:16:05.958\nMolecule A, you know, comes up and docks with this other molecule.\n\n00:16:05.958 --> 00:16:08.958\nAnd it's moving forward, you know, propelled by various charges,\n\n00:16:08.958 --> 00:16:12.958\nand then the soul steps in and tweaks those molecules so that they connect.\n\n00:16:12.958 --> 00:16:15.958\nIt's all mechanistic. We are mechanism.\n\n00:16:15.958 --> 00:16:18.958\nIf we are machines, then in principle at least,\n\n00:16:18.958 --> 00:16:22.958\nwe should be able to build machines out of other stuff,\n\n00:16:22.958 --> 00:16:26.958\nwhich are just as alive as we are.\n\n00:16:26.958 --> 00:16:28.958\nBut I think for us to admit that,\n\n00:16:28.958 --> 00:16:31.958\nwe have to give up on our special-ness, in a certain way.\n\n00:16:31.958 --> 00:16:33.958\nAnd we've had the retreat from special-ness\n\n00:16:33.958 --> 00:16:36.958\nunder the barrage of science and technology many times\n\n00:16:36.958 --> 00:16:38.958\nover the last few hundred years, at least.\n\n00:16:38.958 --> 00:16:40.958\n500 years ago we had to give up the idea\n\n00:16:40.958 --> 00:16:43.958\nthat we are the center of the universe\n\n00:16:43.958 --> 00:16:45.958\nwhen the earth started to go around the sun;\n\n00:16:45.958 --> 00:16:50.958\n150 years ago, with Darwin, we had to give up the idea we were different from animals.\n\n00:16:50.958 --> 00:16:53.958\nAnd to imagine -- you know, it's always hard for us.\n\n00:16:53.958 --> 00:16:56.958\nRecently we've been battered with the idea that maybe\n\n00:16:56.958 --> 00:16:58.958\nwe didn't even have our own creation event, here on earth,\n\n00:16:58.958 --> 00:17:01.958\nwhich people didn't like much. And then the human genome said,\n\n00:17:01.958 --> 00:17:04.958\nmaybe we only have 35,000 genes. And that was really --\n\n00:17:04.958 --> 00:17:07.958\npeople didn't like that, we've got more genes than that.\n\n00:17:07.958 --> 00:17:10.958\nWe don't like to give up our special-ness, so, you know,\n\n00:17:10.958 --> 00:17:12.958\nhaving the idea that robots could really have emotions,\n\n00:17:12.958 --> 00:17:14.958\nor that robots could be living creatures --\n\n00:17:14.958 --> 00:17:16.958\nI think is going to be hard for us to accept.\n\n00:17:16.958 --> 00:17:20.958\nBut we're going to come to accept it over the next 50 years or so.\n\n00:17:20.958 --> 00:17:23.958\nAnd the second question is, will the machines want to take over?\n\n00:17:23.958 --> 00:17:28.958\nAnd here the standard scenario is that we create these things,\n\n00:17:28.958 --> 00:17:31.958\nthey grow, we nurture them, they learn a lot from us,\n\n00:17:31.958 --> 00:17:35.958\nand then they start to decide that we're pretty boring, slow.\n\n00:17:35.958 --> 00:17:37.958\nThey want to take over from us.\n\n00:17:37.958 --> 00:17:40.958\nAnd for those of you that have teenagers, you know what that's like.\n\n00:17:40.958 --> 00:17:41.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:17:41.958 --> 00:17:44.958\nBut Hollywood extends it to the robots.\n\n00:17:44.958 --> 00:17:47.958\nAnd the question is, you know,\n\n00:17:47.958 --> 00:17:51.958\nwill someone accidentally build a robot that takes over from us?\n\n00:17:51.958 --> 00:17:54.958\nAnd that's sort of like this lone guy in the backyard,\n\n00:17:54.958 --> 00:17:57.958\nyou know -- \"I accidentally built a 747.\"\n\n00:17:57.958 --> 00:17:59.958\nI don't think that's going to happen.\n\n00:17:59.958 --> 00:18:01.958\nAnd I don't think --\n\n00:18:01.958 --> 00:18:02.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:18:02.958 --> 00:18:05.958\n-- I don't think we're going to deliberately build robots\n\n00:18:05.958 --> 00:18:07.958\nthat we're uncomfortable with.\n\n00:18:07.958 --> 00:18:09.958\nWe'll -- you know, they're not going to have a super bad robot.\n\n00:18:09.958 --> 00:18:12.958\nBefore that has to come to be a mildly bad robot,\n\n00:18:12.958 --> 00:18:14.958\nand before that a not so bad robot.\n\n00:18:14.958 --> 00:18:15.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:18:15.958 --> 00:18:17.958\nAnd we're just not going to let it go that way.\n\n00:18:17.958 --> 00:18:18.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:18:18.958 --> 00:18:24.958\nSo, I think I'm going to leave it at that: the robots are coming,\n\n00:18:24.958 --> 00:18:27.958\nwe don't have too much to worry about, it's going to be a lot of fun,\n\n00:18:27.958 --> 00:18:31.958\nand I hope you all enjoy the journey over the next 50 years.\n\n00:18:31.958 --> 00:18:33.958\n(Applause)"}, {"title": "Things I've learned in my life so far", "duration": "285", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/stefan_sagmeister_on_what_he_has_learned", "transcript": "I was here about four years ago, talking about the relationship of design and happiness. At the very end of it, I showed a list under that title. I learned very few things in addition since (Laughter) \u2014 but made a whole number of them into projects since. These are inflatable monkeys in every city in Scotland: \"Everybody always thinks they are right.\" They were combined in the media. \"Drugs are fun in the beginning but become a drag later on.\" We're doing changing media. This is a projection that can see the viewer as the viewer walks by. You can't help but actually ripping that spider web apart. All of these things are pieces of graphic design. We do them for our clients. They are commissioned. I would never have the money to actually pay for the installment or pay for all the billboards or the production of these, so there's always a client attached to them. These are 65,000 coat hangers in a street that's lined with fashion stores. \"Worrying solves nothing.\" \"Money does not make me happy\" appeared first as double-page spreads in a magazine. The printer lost the file, didn't tell us. When the magazine \u2014 actually, when I got the subscription \u2014 it was 12 following pages. It said, \"Money does does make me happy.\" And a friend of mine in Austria felt so sorry for me that he talked the largest casino owner in Linz into letting us wrap his building. So this is the big pedestrian zone in Linz. It just says \"Money,\" and if you look down the side street, it says, \"does not make me happy.\" We had a show that just came down last week in New York. We steamed up the windows permanently, and every hour we had a different designer come in and write these things that they've learned into the steam in the window. Everybody participated \u2014 Milton Glaser, Massimo Vignelli. Singapore was quite in discussion. This is a little spot that we filmed there that's to be displayed on the large JumboTrons in Singapore. And, of course, it's one that's dear to my heart, because all of these sentiments \u2014 some banal, some a bit more profound \u2014 all originally had come out of my diary. And I do go often into the diary and check if I wanted to change something about the situation. If it's \u2014 see it for a long enough time, I actually do something about it. And the very last one is a billboard. This is our roof in New York, the roof of the studio. This is newsprint plus stencils that lie on the newsprint. We let that lie around in the sun. As you all know, newsprint yellows significantly in the sun. After a week, we took the stencils and the leaves off, shipped the newsprints to Lisbon to a very sunny spot, so on day one the billboard said, \"Complaining is silly.

Politics and \u2014 let's focus on the political system in particular question here, which is the system of democracy. Democracy, as a type of politics, is a technology for the control and deployment of power. You can deploy power in a wide range of ways. The famous ones \u2014 despotism is a good one; anarchy is a way to not deploy the power in any organized way, to do it in a radically diffused fashion; and democracy is a set of technologies, which have the effect of, in principle, diffusing the power source to a large number of people and then re-concentrating it in a smaller group of people who govern, and who themselves are, in principle, authorized to govern by virtue of what the broader public has done.Now, consider religion \u2014 in this case Islam, which is the religion that, in some direct sense, can be said to be precipitating what we're about to enter. Let me say parenthetically why I think that's the case, because I think it's a potentially controversial statement. I would put it in the following equation: no 9/11, no war. At the beginning of the Bush administration, when President Bush, now President Bush, was running for president, he made it very clear that he was not interested in intervening broadly in the world. In fact, the trend was for disengagement with the rest of the world. That's why we heard about the backing away from the Kyoto protocol, for example. After 9/11, the tables were turned. And the president decided, with his advisors, to undertake some kind of an active intervention in the world around us. That began with Afghanistan, and when Afghanistan went extremely smoothly and quickly, a decision was made through the technology of democracy \u2014 again, notice, not a perfect technology \u2014 but through the technology of democracy that this administration was going to push in the direction of another war \u2014 this time, a war in Iraq.Now, the reason I begin by saying \"no 9/11, no war\" is that we have to acknowledge that Islam, as interpreted by a very, very small, extremely radical group of people, was a precipitating cause of the 9/11 attacks \u2014 the precipitating cause of the 9/11 attacks \u2014 and as a consequence, at one degree of remove, the precipitating cause of the coming war that we're about to be engaged in. And I would add that bin Laden and his followers are consciously devoted to the goal of creating a conflict between democracy, or at least capitalist democracy, on the one hand, and the world of Islam as they see and define it.Now, how is Islam a technology in this conceptual apparatus? Well, it's a technology for, first, salvation in its most basic sense. It's meant to be a mechanism for construing the universe in a way that will bring about the salvation of the individual believer, but it's also meant by the Islamists \u2014 and I use that term to mean people who believe that Islam \u2014 they follow the slogan, Islam is the answer to a wide range of questions, whether they're social, or political, or personal, or spiritual. Within the sphere of people who have that view, and it's a large number of people in the Muslim world who disagree with bin Laden in his application, but agree that Islam is the answer. Islam represents a way of engaging the world through which one can achieve certain desirable goals. And the goals from the perspective of Muslims are, in principle, peace, justice and equality, but on terms that correspond to traditional Muslim teachings.Now, I don't want to leave a misimpression by identifying either of these propositions \u2014 rather, either of these phenomena, democracy or Islam \u2014 as technologies. I don't want to suggest that they are a single thing that you can point to. And I think a good way to prove this is simply to demonstrate to you what my thought process was when deciding what to put on the wall behind me when I spoke. And I ran immediately into a conceptual problem: you can't show a picture of democracy. You can show a slogan, or a symbol, or a sign that stands for democracy. You can show the Capitol \u2014 I had the same problem when I was designing the cover of my forthcoming book, in fact \u2014 what do you put on the cover to show democracy? And the same problem with respect to Islam. You can show a mosque, or you can show worshippers, but there's not a straightforward way of depicting Islam. That's because these are the kinds of concepts that are not susceptible to easy representation.Now, it follows from that, that they're deeply contestable. It follows from that that all of the people in the world who say that they are Muslims can, in principle, subscribe to a wide range of different interpretations of what Islam really is, and the same is true of democracy. In other words, unlike the word hope, which one could look up in a dictionary and derive origins for, and, perhaps, reach some kind of a consensual use analysis, these are essentially contested concepts. They're ideas about which people disagree in the deepest possible sense. And as a consequence of this disagreement, it's very, very difficult for anyone to say, \"I have the right version of Islam.\" You know, post-9/11, we were treated to the amazing phenomenon of George W. Bush saying, \"Islam means peace.\" Well, so says George W. Bush. Other people would say it means something else. Some people would say that Islam means submission. Other people would say it means an acknowledgement or recognition of God's sovereignty. There are a wide range of different things that Islam can mean. And ostensibly, the same is true of democracy. Some people say that democracy consists basically in elections. Other people say no, that's not enough, there have to be basic liberal rights: free speech, free press, equality of citizens. These are contested points, and it's impossible to answer them by saying, \"Ah ha, I looked in the right place, and I found out what these concepts mean.\"Now, if Islam and democracy are at present in a moment of great confrontation, what does that mean? Well, you could fit it into a range of different interpretative frameworks. You could begin with the one that we began with a couple of days ago, which was fear. Fear is not an implausible reaction with a war just around the corner and with a very, very high likelihood that many, many people are going to die as a consequence of this confrontation \u2014 a confrontation which many, many people in the Muslim world do not want, many, many people in the American democracy do not want, many people elsewhere in the world do not want, but which nonetheless is favored by a large enough number of people \u2014 at least in the relevant space, which is the United States \u2014 to actually go forward. So fear is not a crazy response at all. And I think that that's, in fact, probably the first appropriate response.What I want to suggest to you, though, in the next couple of minutes is that there's also a hopeful response to this. And the hopeful response derives from recognizing that Islam and democracy are technologies. And by virtue of being technologies, they're manipulable. And they're manipulable in ways that can produce some extremely positive outcomes. What do I have in mind? Well, all over the Muslim world there are people who take Islam deeply seriously, people who care about Islam, for whom it's a source either of faith, or of civilization, or of deep values, or just a source of powerful personal identity, who think and are saying loudly that Islam and democracy are in fact not in conflict, but are in fact deeply compatible. And these Muslims \u2014 and it's the vast majority of Muslims \u2014 disagree profoundly with bin Laden's approach, profoundly. And they furthermore think overwhelmingly \u2014 again one can't speak of every person, but overwhelmingly, and one can find this by reading any of the sources that they have produced, and they're all over the Internet and in all sorts of languages \u2014 one can see that they're saying that their concern in their own countries is primarily to free up themselves to have choice in the spheres of personal life, in the sphere of economics, in the sphere of politics, and, yes, in the sphere of religion, which is itself closely regulated in most of the Muslim world.And many of these Muslims further say that their disagreement with the United States is that it, in the past and still in the present, has sided with autocratic rulers in the Muslim world in order to promote America's short-term interests. Now, during the Cold War, that may have been a defensible position for the United States to take. That's an academic question. It may be that there was a great war to be fought between West and East, and it was necessary on the axis of democracy against communism. And it was necessary in some way for these to contradict each other, and as a consequence you have to make friends wherever you can get them. But now that the Cold War is over, there's nearly universal consensus in the Muslim world \u2014 and pretty close to the same here in the United States, if you talk to people and ask them \u2014 that in principle, there's no reason that democracy and Islam cannot co-exist. And we see this among activist, practical Muslims, like the Muslims who are presently the elected, parliamentary, democratic government of Turkey, who are behaving pragmatically, not ideologically, who are promoting their own religious values, who are elected by their own people because they were perceived as honest and sincere because of their religious values, but who do not think that Islam and a democratic system of governance are fundamentally incompatible.Now, you may say, but surely, what we've seen on television about Saudi Islam convinces us that it can't possibly be compatible with what we consider the core of democracy \u2014 namely, free political choice, basic liberty and basic equality. But I'm here to tell you that technologies are more malleable than that. I'm here to tell you that many, many Muslims believe \u2014 the vast majority, in fact \u2014 in fact I think I would go so far as to say that many Muslims in Saudi Arabia believe that the core values of Islam, namely acknowledgement of God's sovereignty and basic human equality before God, are themselves compatible with liberty, equality and free political choice. And there are Muslims, many Muslims out there, who are saying precisely this. And they're making this argument wherever they're permitted to make it. But their governments, needless to say, are relatively threatened by this. And for the most part try to stop them from making this argument.So, for example, a group of young activists in Egypt try to form a party known as the Center Party, which advocated the compatibility of Islam and democracy. They weren't even allowed to form a party. They were actually blocked from even forming a party under the political system there. Why? Because they would have done extraordinarily well. In the most recent elections in the Muslim world \u2014 which are those in Pakistan, those in Morocco and those in Turkey \u2014 in each case, people who present themselves to the electorate as Islamic democrats were far and away the most successful vote-getters every place they were allowed to run freely. So in Morocco, for example, they finished third in the political race but they were only allowed to contest half the seats. So had they contested a larger number of the seats, they would have done even better. Now what I want to suggest to you is that the reason for hope in this case is that we are on the edge of a real transformation in the Muslim world. And that's a transformation in which many sincerely believing Muslims \u2014 who care very, very deeply about their traditions, who do not want to compromise those values \u2014 believe, through the malleability of the technology of democracy and the malleability and synthetic capability of the technology of Islam, that these two ideas can work together.Now what would that look like? What does it mean to say that there's an Islamic democracy? Well, one thing is, it's not going to look identical to democracy as we know it in the United States. That may be a good thing, in light of some of the criticisms we've heard today \u2014 for example, in the regulatory context \u2014 of what democracy produces. It will also not look exactly the way either the people in this room, or Muslims out in the rest of the world \u2014 I don't mean to imply there aren't Muslims here, there probably are \u2014 conceptualize Islam. It will be transformative of Islam as well. And as a result of this convergence, this synthetic attempt to make sense of these two ideas together, there's a real possibility that, instead of a clash of Islamic civilization \u2014 if there is such a thing \u2014 and democratic civilization \u2014 if there is such a thing \u2014 we'll in fact have close compatibility.Now, I began with the war because it's the elephant in the room, and you can't pretend that there isn't about to be a war if you're talking about these issues. The war has tremendous risks for the model that I'm describing because it's very possible that as a consequence of a war, many Muslims will conclude that the United States is not the kind of place that they want to emulate with respect to its forms of political government. On the other hand, there's a further possibility that many Americans, swept up in the fever of a war, will say, and feel, and think that Islam is the enemy somehow \u2014 that Islam ought to be construed as the enemy. And even though, for political tactical reasons, the president has been very, very good about saying that Islam is not the enemy, nonetheless, there's a natural impulse when one enters war to think of the other side as an enemy. And one furthermore has the impulse to generalize, as much as possible, in defining who that enemy is. So the risks are very great.On the other hand, the capacities for positive results in the aftermath of a war are also not to be underestimated, even by, and I would say especially by, people who are deeply skeptical about whether we should go to war in the first place. Those who oppose the war ought to realize that if a war happens, it cannot be the right strategy, either pragmatically, or spiritually, or morally, to say after the war, \"Well, let's let it all run itself out, and play out however it wants to play out, because we opposed the war in the first place.\" That's not the way human circumstances operate. You face the circumstances you have in front of you and you go forward.Well, what I'm here to say then is, for people who are skeptical about the war, it's especially important to recognize that in the aftermath of the war there is a possibility for the government of the United States and the Muslim peoples with whom it interacts to create real forms of government that are truly democratic and also truly Islamic. And it is crucial \u2014 it is crucial in a practical, activist way \u2014 for people who care about these issues to make sure that within the technology of democracy, in this system, they exercise their preferences, their choices and their voices to encourage that outcome. That's a hopeful message, but it's a message that's hopeful only if you understand it as incurring serious obligation for all of us. And I think that we are capable of taking on that obligation, but only if we put what we can into it. And if we do, then I don't think that the hope will be unwarranted altogether.Thanks.", "id": 358, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:11.958 --> 00:00:16.958\nI want to argue to you that in fact, politics and religion,\n\n00:00:16.958 --> 00:00:18.958\nwhich are the two primary factors --\n\n00:00:18.958 --> 00:00:21.958\nnot the sole, but overwhelmingly, the primary factors --\n\n00:00:21.958 --> 00:00:24.958\nwhich are driving towards a war which looks extremely likely --\n\n00:00:24.958 --> 00:00:26.958\nbordering on the inevitable at this point,\n\n00:00:26.958 --> 00:00:28.958\nwhether one is in favor of that or not --\n\n00:00:28.958 --> 00:00:31.958\nthat politics and religion are, in fact, themselves\n\n00:00:31.958 --> 00:00:35.958\nbetter conceptualized as kinds of technology,\n\n00:00:35.958 --> 00:00:40.958\nand subject to kinds of questions that we regularly consider\n\n00:00:40.958 --> 00:00:43.958\nin the space of conceptual design.\n\n00:00:43.958 --> 00:00:46.958\nHere's what I mean. Politics and --\n\n00:00:46.958 --> 00:00:49.958\nlet's focus on the political system in particular question here,\n\n00:00:49.958 --> 00:00:51.958\nwhich is the system of democracy.\n\n00:00:51.958 --> 00:00:55.958\nDemocracy, as a type of politics, is a technology\n\n00:00:55.958 --> 00:00:57.958\nfor the control and deployment of power.\n\n00:00:57.958 --> 00:01:00.958\nYou can deploy power in a wide range of ways.\n\n00:01:00.958 --> 00:01:02.958\nThe famous ones -- despotism is a good one;\n\n00:01:02.958 --> 00:01:05.958\nanarchy is a way to not deploy the power in any organized way,\n\n00:01:05.958 --> 00:01:07.958\nto do it in a radically diffused fashion;\n\n00:01:07.958 --> 00:01:09.958\nand democracy is a set of technologies,\n\n00:01:09.958 --> 00:01:12.958\nwhich have the effect of, in principle,\n\n00:01:12.958 --> 00:01:15.958\ndiffusing the power source to a large number of people\n\n00:01:15.958 --> 00:01:18.958\nand then re-concentrating it in a smaller group of people who govern,\n\n00:01:18.958 --> 00:01:22.958\nand who themselves are, in principle, authorized to govern\n\n00:01:22.958 --> 00:01:25.958\nby virtue of what the broader public has done.\n\n00:01:25.958 --> 00:01:28.958\nNow, consider religion -- in this case Islam,\n\n00:01:28.958 --> 00:01:31.958\nwhich is the religion that, in some direct sense,\n\n00:01:31.958 --> 00:01:35.958\ncan be said to be precipitating what we're about to enter.\n\n00:01:35.958 --> 00:01:37.958\nLet me say parenthetically why I think that's the case,\n\n00:01:37.958 --> 00:01:40.958\nbecause I think it's a potentially controversial statement.\n\n00:01:40.958 --> 00:01:44.958\nI would put it in the following equation: no 9/11, no war.\n\n00:01:44.958 --> 00:01:48.958\nAt the beginning of the Bush administration,\n\n00:01:48.958 --> 00:01:51.958\nwhen President Bush, now President Bush, was running for president,\n\n00:01:51.958 --> 00:01:54.958\nhe made it very clear that he was not interested in intervening broadly in the world.\n\n00:01:54.958 --> 00:01:57.958\nIn fact, the trend was for disengagement with the rest of the world.\n\n00:01:57.958 --> 00:02:00.958\nThat's why we heard about the backing away from the Kyoto protocol, for example.\n\n00:02:01.958 --> 00:02:04.958\nAfter 9/11, the tables were turned.\n\n00:02:04.958 --> 00:02:07.958\nAnd the president decided, with his advisors,\n\n00:02:07.958 --> 00:02:11.958\nto undertake some kind of an active intervention in the world around us.\n\n00:02:11.958 --> 00:02:13.958\nThat began with Afghanistan,\n\n00:02:13.958 --> 00:02:16.958\nand when Afghanistan went extremely smoothly and quickly,\n\n00:02:16.958 --> 00:02:20.958\na decision was made through the technology of democracy --\n\n00:02:20.958 --> 00:02:23.958\nagain, notice, not a perfect technology --\n\n00:02:23.958 --> 00:02:25.958\nbut through the technology of democracy\n\n00:02:25.958 --> 00:02:28.958\nthat this administration was going to push in the direction of another war --\n\n00:02:28.958 --> 00:02:30.958\nthis time, a war in Iraq.\n\n00:02:30.958 --> 00:02:35.958\nNow, the reason I begin by saying \"no 9/11, no war\"\n\n00:02:35.958 --> 00:02:39.958\nis that we have to acknowledge that Islam,\n\n00:02:39.958 --> 00:02:45.958\nas interpreted by a very, very small, extremely radical group of people,\n\n00:02:45.958 --> 00:02:49.958\nwas a precipitating cause of the 9/11 attacks --\n\n00:02:49.958 --> 00:02:51.958\nthe precipitating cause of the 9/11 attacks --\n\n00:02:51.958 --> 00:02:54.958\nand as a consequence, at one degree of remove,\n\n00:02:54.958 --> 00:02:58.958\nthe precipitating cause of the coming war that we're about to be engaged in.\n\n00:02:58.958 --> 00:03:01.958\nAnd I would add that bin Laden and his followers\n\n00:03:01.958 --> 00:03:06.958\nare consciously devoted to the goal of creating a conflict between democracy,\n\n00:03:06.958 --> 00:03:09.958\nor at least capitalist democracy, on the one hand,\n\n00:03:09.958 --> 00:03:13.958\nand the world of Islam as they see and define it.\n\n00:03:13.958 --> 00:03:16.958\nNow, how is Islam a technology in this conceptual apparatus?\n\n00:03:16.958 --> 00:03:20.958\nWell, it's a technology for, first, salvation in its most basic sense.\n\n00:03:20.958 --> 00:03:23.958\nIt's meant to be a mechanism for construing the universe\n\n00:03:23.958 --> 00:03:27.958\nin a way that will bring about the salvation of the individual believer,\n\n00:03:27.958 --> 00:03:29.958\nbut it's also meant by the Islamists --\n\n00:03:29.958 --> 00:03:33.958\nand I use that term to mean people who believe that Islam --\n\n00:03:33.958 --> 00:03:36.958\nthey follow the slogan, Islam is the answer to a wide range of questions,\n\n00:03:36.958 --> 00:03:39.958\nwhether they're social, or political, or personal, or spiritual.\n\n00:03:39.958 --> 00:03:41.958\nWithin the sphere of people who have that view,\n\n00:03:41.958 --> 00:03:43.958\nand it's a large number of people in the Muslim world\n\n00:03:43.958 --> 00:03:45.958\nwho disagree with bin Laden in his application,\n\n00:03:45.958 --> 00:03:47.958\nbut agree that Islam is the answer.\n\n00:03:47.958 --> 00:03:50.958\nIslam represents a way of engaging the world\n\n00:03:50.958 --> 00:03:53.958\nthrough which one can achieve certain desirable goals.\n\n00:03:53.958 --> 00:03:57.958\nAnd the goals from the perspective of Muslims are, in principle,\n\n00:03:57.958 --> 00:04:00.958\npeace, justice and equality,\n\n00:04:00.958 --> 00:04:04.958\nbut on terms that correspond to traditional Muslim teachings.\n\n00:04:04.958 --> 00:04:07.958\nNow, I don't want to leave a misimpression\n\n00:04:07.958 --> 00:04:10.958\nby identifying either of these propositions --\n\n00:04:10.958 --> 00:04:14.958\nrather, either of these phenomena, democracy or Islam -- as technologies.\n\n00:04:14.958 --> 00:04:17.958\nI don't want to suggest that they are a single thing that you can point to.\n\n00:04:17.958 --> 00:04:19.958\nAnd I think a good way to prove this\n\n00:04:19.958 --> 00:04:22.958\nis simply to demonstrate to you what my thought process was\n\n00:04:22.958 --> 00:04:25.958\nwhen deciding what to put on the wall behind me when I spoke.\n\n00:04:25.958 --> 00:04:27.958\nAnd I ran immediately into a conceptual problem:\n\n00:04:27.958 --> 00:04:29.958\nyou can't show a picture of democracy.\n\n00:04:29.958 --> 00:04:34.958\nYou can show a slogan, or a symbol, or a sign that stands for democracy.\n\n00:04:34.958 --> 00:04:35.958\nYou can show the Capitol --\n\n00:04:35.958 --> 00:04:37.958\nI had the same problem when I was designing the cover\n\n00:04:37.958 --> 00:04:39.958\nof my forthcoming book, in fact --\n\n00:04:39.958 --> 00:04:41.958\nwhat do you put on the cover to show democracy?\n\n00:04:41.958 --> 00:04:43.958\nAnd the same problem with respect to Islam.\n\n00:04:43.958 --> 00:04:45.958\nYou can show a mosque, or you can show worshippers,\n\n00:04:45.958 --> 00:04:47.958\nbut there's not a straightforward way of depicting Islam.\n\n00:04:47.958 --> 00:04:49.958\nThat's because these are the kinds of concepts\n\n00:04:49.958 --> 00:04:52.958\nthat are not susceptible to easy representation.\n\n00:04:52.958 --> 00:04:55.958\nNow, it follows from that, that they're deeply contestable.\n\n00:04:55.958 --> 00:04:58.958\nIt follows from that that all of the people in the world\n\n00:04:58.958 --> 00:05:00.958\nwho say that they are Muslims can, in principle,\n\n00:05:00.958 --> 00:05:03.958\nsubscribe to a wide range of different interpretations\n\n00:05:03.958 --> 00:05:08.958\nof what Islam really is, and the same is true of democracy.\n\n00:05:08.958 --> 00:05:11.958\nIn other words, unlike the word hope,\n\n00:05:11.958 --> 00:05:15.958\nwhich one could look up in a dictionary and derive origins for,\n\n00:05:15.958 --> 00:05:18.958\nand, perhaps, reach some kind of a consensual use analysis,\n\n00:05:18.958 --> 00:05:20.958\nthese are essentially contested concepts.\n\n00:05:20.958 --> 00:05:26.958\nThey're ideas about which people disagree in the deepest possible sense.\n\n00:05:26.958 --> 00:05:29.958\nAnd as a consequence of this disagreement,\n\n00:05:29.958 --> 00:05:31.958\nit's very, very difficult for anyone to say,\n\n00:05:31.958 --> 00:05:33.958\n\"I have the right version of Islam.\"\n\n00:05:33.958 --> 00:05:36.958\nYou know, post-9/11, we were treated to the amazing phenomenon\n\n00:05:36.958 --> 00:05:39.958\nof George W. Bush saying, \"Islam means peace.\"\n\n00:05:39.958 --> 00:05:42.958\nWell, so says George W. Bush.\n\n00:05:42.958 --> 00:05:44.958\nOther people would say it means something else.\n\n00:05:44.958 --> 00:05:46.958\nSome people would say that Islam means submission.\n\n00:05:46.958 --> 00:05:48.958\nOther people would say it means an acknowledgement\n\n00:05:48.958 --> 00:05:50.958\nor recognition of God's sovereignty.\n\n00:05:50.958 --> 00:05:53.958\nThere are a wide range of different things that Islam can mean.\n\n00:05:53.958 --> 00:05:55.958\nAnd ostensibly, the same is true of democracy.\n\n00:05:55.958 --> 00:05:58.958\nSome people say that democracy consists basically in elections.\n\n00:05:58.958 --> 00:06:00.958\nOther people say no, that's not enough,\n\n00:06:00.958 --> 00:06:04.958\nthere have to be basic liberal rights: free speech, free press, equality of citizens.\n\n00:06:04.958 --> 00:06:07.958\nThese are contested points, and it's impossible to answer them by saying,\n\n00:06:07.958 --> 00:06:10.958\n\"Ah ha, I looked in the right place, and I found out what these concepts mean.\"\n\n00:06:11.958 --> 00:06:15.958\nNow, if Islam and democracy are at present\n\n00:06:15.958 --> 00:06:17.958\nin a moment of great confrontation,\n\n00:06:17.958 --> 00:06:19.958\nwhat does that mean?\n\n00:06:19.958 --> 00:06:23.958\nWell, you could fit it into a range of different interpretative frameworks.\n\n00:06:23.958 --> 00:06:26.958\nYou could begin with the one that we began with a couple of days ago,\n\n00:06:26.958 --> 00:06:28.958\nwhich was fear.\n\n00:06:28.958 --> 00:06:33.958\nFear is not an implausible reaction with a war just around the corner\n\n00:06:33.958 --> 00:06:36.958\nand with a very, very high likelihood that many, many people are going to die\n\n00:06:36.958 --> 00:06:38.958\nas a consequence of this confrontation --\n\n00:06:38.958 --> 00:06:40.958\na confrontation which many, many people\n\n00:06:40.958 --> 00:06:42.958\nin the Muslim world do not want,\n\n00:06:42.958 --> 00:06:45.958\nmany, many people in the American democracy do not want,\n\n00:06:45.958 --> 00:06:47.958\nmany people elsewhere in the world do not want,\n\n00:06:47.958 --> 00:06:50.958\nbut which nonetheless is favored by a large enough number of people --\n\n00:06:50.958 --> 00:06:54.958\nat least in the relevant space, which is the United States --\n\n00:06:54.958 --> 00:06:57.958\nto actually go forward. So fear is not a crazy response at all.\n\n00:06:57.958 --> 00:07:01.958\nAnd I think that that's, in fact, probably the first appropriate response.\n\n00:07:01.958 --> 00:07:04.958\nWhat I want to suggest to you, though, in the next couple of minutes\n\n00:07:04.958 --> 00:07:08.958\nis that there's also a hopeful response to this.\n\n00:07:08.958 --> 00:07:11.958\nAnd the hopeful response derives from recognizing\n\n00:07:11.958 --> 00:07:13.958\nthat Islam and democracy are technologies.\n\n00:07:13.958 --> 00:07:16.958\nAnd by virtue of being technologies, they're manipulable.\n\n00:07:16.958 --> 00:07:18.958\nAnd they're manipulable in ways\n\n00:07:18.958 --> 00:07:20.958\nthat can produce some extremely positive outcomes.\n\n00:07:20.958 --> 00:07:22.958\nWhat do I have in mind?\n\n00:07:22.958 --> 00:07:25.958\nWell, all over the Muslim world there are people\n\n00:07:25.958 --> 00:07:29.958\nwho take Islam deeply seriously, people who care about Islam,\n\n00:07:29.958 --> 00:07:33.958\nfor whom it's a source either of faith, or of civilization, or of deep values,\n\n00:07:33.958 --> 00:07:35.958\nor just a source of powerful personal identity,\n\n00:07:35.958 --> 00:07:39.958\nwho think and are saying loudly that Islam and democracy\n\n00:07:39.958 --> 00:07:43.958\nare in fact not in conflict, but are in fact deeply compatible.\n\n00:07:43.958 --> 00:07:46.958\nAnd these Muslims -- and it's the vast majority of Muslims --\n\n00:07:46.958 --> 00:07:51.958\ndisagree profoundly with bin Laden's approach, profoundly.\n\n00:07:51.958 --> 00:07:54.958\nAnd they furthermore think overwhelmingly --\n\n00:07:54.958 --> 00:07:56.958\nagain one can't speak of every person, but overwhelmingly,\n\n00:07:56.958 --> 00:07:58.958\nand one can find this by reading any of the sources\n\n00:07:58.958 --> 00:08:01.958\nthat they have produced, and they're all over the Internet\n\n00:08:01.958 --> 00:08:04.958\nand in all sorts of languages -- one can see that they're saying\n\n00:08:04.958 --> 00:08:10.958\nthat their concern in their own countries is primarily to free up themselves\n\n00:08:10.958 --> 00:08:14.958\nto have choice in the spheres of personal life,\n\n00:08:14.958 --> 00:08:17.958\nin the sphere of economics, in the sphere of politics,\n\n00:08:17.958 --> 00:08:19.958\nand, yes, in the sphere of religion,\n\n00:08:19.958 --> 00:08:22.958\nwhich is itself closely regulated in most of the Muslim world.\n\n00:08:22.958 --> 00:08:24.958\nAnd many of these Muslims further say\n\n00:08:24.958 --> 00:08:27.958\nthat their disagreement with the United States\n\n00:08:27.958 --> 00:08:30.958\nis that it, in the past and still in the present,\n\n00:08:30.958 --> 00:08:34.958\nhas sided with autocratic rulers in the Muslim world\n\n00:08:34.958 --> 00:08:40.958\nin order to promote America's short-term interests.\n\n00:08:40.958 --> 00:08:42.958\nNow, during the Cold War, that may have been\n\n00:08:42.958 --> 00:08:44.958\na defensible position for the United States to take.\n\n00:08:44.958 --> 00:08:46.958\nThat's an academic question.\n\n00:08:46.958 --> 00:08:49.958\nIt may be that there was a great war to be fought between West and East,\n\n00:08:49.958 --> 00:08:53.958\nand it was necessary on the axis of democracy against communism.\n\n00:08:53.958 --> 00:08:56.958\nAnd it was necessary in some way for these to contradict each other,\n\n00:08:56.958 --> 00:08:59.958\nand as a consequence you have to make friends wherever you can get them.\n\n00:08:59.958 --> 00:09:01.958\nBut now that the Cold War is over,\n\n00:09:01.958 --> 00:09:05.958\nthere's nearly universal consensus in the Muslim world --\n\n00:09:05.958 --> 00:09:07.958\nand pretty close to the same here in the United States,\n\n00:09:07.958 --> 00:09:09.958\nif you talk to people and ask them --\n\n00:09:09.958 --> 00:09:13.958\nthat in principle, there's no reason that democracy and Islam cannot co-exist.\n\n00:09:13.958 --> 00:09:16.958\nAnd we see this among activist, practical Muslims,\n\n00:09:16.958 --> 00:09:18.958\nlike the Muslims who are presently the elected,\n\n00:09:18.958 --> 00:09:20.958\nparliamentary, democratic government of Turkey,\n\n00:09:20.958 --> 00:09:23.958\nwho are behaving pragmatically, not ideologically,\n\n00:09:23.958 --> 00:09:25.958\nwho are promoting their own religious values,\n\n00:09:25.958 --> 00:09:27.958\nwho are elected by their own people\n\n00:09:27.958 --> 00:09:29.958\nbecause they were perceived as honest and sincere\n\n00:09:29.958 --> 00:09:31.958\nbecause of their religious values,\n\n00:09:31.958 --> 00:09:35.958\nbut who do not think that Islam and a democratic system of governance\n\n00:09:35.958 --> 00:09:37.958\nare fundamentally incompatible.\n\n00:09:37.958 --> 00:09:42.958\nNow, you may say, but surely, what we've seen on television about Saudi Islam\n\n00:09:42.958 --> 00:09:44.958\nconvinces us that it can't possibly be compatible\n\n00:09:44.958 --> 00:09:46.958\nwith what we consider the core of democracy --\n\n00:09:46.958 --> 00:09:50.958\nnamely, free political choice, basic liberty and basic equality.\n\n00:09:50.958 --> 00:09:54.958\nBut I'm here to tell you that technologies\n\n00:09:54.958 --> 00:09:56.958\nare more malleable than that.\n\n00:09:56.958 --> 00:09:59.958\nI'm here to tell you that many, many Muslims believe --\n\n00:09:59.958 --> 00:10:01.958\nthe vast majority, in fact -- in fact I think I would go so far as to say\n\n00:10:01.958 --> 00:10:05.958\nthat many Muslims in Saudi Arabia believe that the core values of Islam,\n\n00:10:05.958 --> 00:10:07.958\nnamely acknowledgement of God's sovereignty\n\n00:10:07.958 --> 00:10:10.958\nand basic human equality before God,\n\n00:10:10.958 --> 00:10:14.958\nare themselves compatible with liberty, equality and free political choice.\n\n00:10:14.958 --> 00:10:19.958\nAnd there are Muslims, many Muslims out there, who are saying precisely this.\n\n00:10:19.958 --> 00:10:22.958\nAnd they're making this argument wherever they're permitted to make it.\n\n00:10:22.958 --> 00:10:24.958\nBut their governments, needless to say, are relatively threatened by this.\n\n00:10:24.958 --> 00:10:27.958\nAnd for the most part try to stop them from making this argument.\n\n00:10:27.958 --> 00:10:31.958\nSo, for example, a group of young activists in Egypt\n\n00:10:31.958 --> 00:10:33.958\ntry to form a party known as the Center Party,\n\n00:10:33.958 --> 00:10:35.958\nwhich advocated the compatibility of Islam and democracy.\n\n00:10:35.958 --> 00:10:37.958\nThey weren't even allowed to form a party.\n\n00:10:37.958 --> 00:10:39.958\nThey were actually blocked from even forming a party\n\n00:10:39.958 --> 00:10:41.958\nunder the political system there. Why?\n\n00:10:41.958 --> 00:10:43.958\nBecause they would have done extraordinarily well.\n\n00:10:43.958 --> 00:10:45.958\nIn the most recent elections in the Muslim world --\n\n00:10:45.958 --> 00:10:48.958\nwhich are those in Pakistan, those in Morocco\n\n00:10:48.958 --> 00:10:50.958\nand those in Turkey -- in each case,\n\n00:10:50.958 --> 00:10:53.958\npeople who present themselves to the electorate as Islamic democrats\n\n00:10:53.958 --> 00:10:56.958\nwere far and away the most successful vote-getters\n\n00:10:56.958 --> 00:11:00.958\nevery place they were allowed to run freely.\n\n00:11:00.958 --> 00:11:04.958\nSo in Morocco, for example, they finished third in the political race\n\n00:11:04.958 --> 00:11:06.958\nbut they were only allowed to contest half the seats.\n\n00:11:06.958 --> 00:11:08.958\nSo had they contested a larger number of the seats,\n\n00:11:08.958 --> 00:11:10.958\nthey would have done even better.\n\n00:11:10.958 --> 00:11:13.958\nNow what I want to suggest to you is that the reason for hope in this case\n\n00:11:13.958 --> 00:11:18.958\nis that we are on the edge of a real transformation in the Muslim world.\n\n00:11:18.958 --> 00:11:22.958\nAnd that's a transformation in which many sincerely believing Muslims --\n\n00:11:22.958 --> 00:11:25.958\nwho care very, very deeply about their traditions,\n\n00:11:25.958 --> 00:11:28.958\nwho do not want to compromise those values --\n\n00:11:28.958 --> 00:11:32.958\nbelieve, through the malleability of the technology of democracy\n\n00:11:32.958 --> 00:11:37.958\nand the malleability and synthetic capability of the technology of Islam,\n\n00:11:37.958 --> 00:11:40.958\nthat these two ideas can work together.\n\n00:11:40.958 --> 00:11:42.958\nNow what would that look like?\n\n00:11:42.958 --> 00:11:45.958\nWhat does it mean to say that there's an Islamic democracy?\n\n00:11:45.958 --> 00:11:47.958\nWell, one thing is, it's not going to look identical\n\n00:11:47.958 --> 00:11:50.958\nto democracy as we know it in the United States.\n\n00:11:50.958 --> 00:11:53.958\nThat may be a good thing, in light of some of the criticisms we've heard today --\n\n00:11:53.958 --> 00:11:57.958\nfor example, in the regulatory context -- of what democracy produces.\n\n00:11:57.958 --> 00:12:01.958\nIt will also not look exactly the way either the people in this room,\n\n00:12:01.958 --> 00:12:03.958\nor Muslims out in the rest of the world --\n\n00:12:03.958 --> 00:12:06.958\nI don't mean to imply there aren't Muslims here, there probably are --\n\n00:12:06.958 --> 00:12:08.958\nconceptualize Islam.\n\n00:12:08.958 --> 00:12:11.958\nIt will be transformative of Islam as well.\n\n00:12:11.958 --> 00:12:14.958\nAnd as a result of this convergence,\n\n00:12:14.958 --> 00:12:18.958\nthis synthetic attempt to make sense of these two ideas together,\n\n00:12:18.958 --> 00:12:21.958\nthere's a real possibility that, instead of a clash\n\n00:12:21.958 --> 00:12:24.958\nof Islamic civilization -- if there is such a thing --\n\n00:12:24.958 --> 00:12:26.958\nand democratic civilization -- if there is such a thing --\n\n00:12:26.958 --> 00:12:29.958\nwe'll in fact have close compatibility.\n\n00:12:29.958 --> 00:12:33.958\nNow, I began with the war because it's the elephant in the room,\n\n00:12:33.958 --> 00:12:35.958\nand you can't pretend that there isn't about to be a war\n\n00:12:35.958 --> 00:12:37.958\nif you're talking about these issues.\n\n00:12:37.958 --> 00:12:40.958\nThe war has tremendous risks for the model that I'm describing\n\n00:12:40.958 --> 00:12:43.958\nbecause it's very possible that as a consequence of a war,\n\n00:12:43.958 --> 00:12:46.958\nmany Muslims will conclude that the United States\n\n00:12:46.958 --> 00:12:48.958\nis not the kind of place that they want to emulate\n\n00:12:48.958 --> 00:12:51.958\nwith respect to its forms of political government.\n\n00:12:51.958 --> 00:12:54.958\nOn the other hand, there's a further possibility that many Americans,\n\n00:12:54.958 --> 00:12:59.958\nswept up in the fever of a war, will say, and feel, and think\n\n00:12:59.958 --> 00:13:01.958\nthat Islam is the enemy somehow --\n\n00:13:01.958 --> 00:13:04.958\nthat Islam ought to be construed as the enemy.\n\n00:13:04.958 --> 00:13:06.958\nAnd even though, for political tactical reasons,\n\n00:13:06.958 --> 00:13:10.958\nthe president has been very, very good about saying that Islam is not the enemy,\n\n00:13:10.958 --> 00:13:13.958\nnonetheless, there's a natural impulse when one enters war\n\n00:13:13.958 --> 00:13:15.958\nto think of the other side as an enemy.\n\n00:13:15.958 --> 00:13:18.958\nAnd one furthermore has the impulse to generalize, as much as possible,\n\n00:13:18.958 --> 00:13:20.958\nin defining who that enemy is.\n\n00:13:20.958 --> 00:13:22.958\nSo the risks are very great.\n\n00:13:22.958 --> 00:13:29.958\nOn the other hand, the capacities for positive results in the aftermath of a war\n\n00:13:29.958 --> 00:13:31.958\nare also not to be underestimated,\n\n00:13:31.958 --> 00:13:34.958\neven by, and I would say especially by, people\n\n00:13:34.958 --> 00:13:37.958\nwho are deeply skeptical about whether we should go to war in the first place.\n\n00:13:37.958 --> 00:13:42.958\nThose who oppose the war ought to realize that if a war happens,\n\n00:13:42.958 --> 00:13:44.958\nit cannot be the right strategy,\n\n00:13:44.958 --> 00:13:50.958\neither pragmatically, or spiritually, or morally, to say after the war,\n\n00:13:50.958 --> 00:13:53.958\n\"Well, let's let it all run itself out, and play out however it wants to play out,\n\n00:13:53.958 --> 00:13:55.958\nbecause we opposed the war in the first place.\"\n\n00:13:55.958 --> 00:13:57.958\nThat's not the way human circumstances operate.\n\n00:13:57.958 --> 00:13:59.958\nYou face the circumstances you have in front of you\n\n00:13:59.958 --> 00:14:01.958\nand you go forward.\n\n00:14:01.958 --> 00:14:03.958\nWell, what I'm here to say then is,\n\n00:14:03.958 --> 00:14:05.958\nfor people who are skeptical about the war,\n\n00:14:05.958 --> 00:14:08.958\nit's especially important to recognize that in the aftermath of the war\n\n00:14:08.958 --> 00:14:12.958\nthere is a possibility for the government of the United States\n\n00:14:12.958 --> 00:14:15.958\nand the Muslim peoples with whom it interacts\n\n00:14:15.958 --> 00:14:18.958\nto create real forms of government that are truly democratic\n\n00:14:18.958 --> 00:14:20.958\nand also truly Islamic.\n\n00:14:20.958 --> 00:14:24.958\nAnd it is crucial -- it is crucial in a practical, activist way --\n\n00:14:24.958 --> 00:14:28.958\nfor people who care about these issues to make sure\n\n00:14:28.958 --> 00:14:31.958\nthat within the technology of democracy, in this system,\n\n00:14:31.958 --> 00:14:34.958\nthey exercise their preferences, their choices and their voices\n\n00:14:34.958 --> 00:14:36.958\nto encourage that outcome.\n\n00:14:36.958 --> 00:14:38.958\nThat's a hopeful message,\n\n00:14:38.958 --> 00:14:40.958\nbut it's a message that's hopeful only if you understand it\n\n00:14:40.958 --> 00:14:43.958\nas incurring serious obligation for all of us.\n\n00:14:43.958 --> 00:14:46.958\nAnd I think that we are capable of taking on that obligation,\n\n00:14:46.958 --> 00:14:49.958\nbut only if we put what we can into it.\n\n00:14:49.958 --> 00:14:53.958\nAnd if we do, then I don't think that the hope will be unwarranted altogether.\n\n00:14:53.958 --> 00:14:54.958\nThanks."}, {"title": "The Blur Building and other tech-empowered architecture", "duration": "1164", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/liz_diller_plays_with_architecture", "transcript": "Aside from keeping the rain out and producing some usable space, architecture is nothing but a special-effects machine that delights and disturbs the senses.Our work is across media. The work comes in all shapes and sizes. It's small and large. This is an ashtray, a water glass. From urban planning and master planning to theater and all sorts of stuff. The thing that all the work has in common is that it challenges the assumptions about conventions of space. And these are everyday conventions, conventions that are so obvious that we are blinded by their familiarity. And I've assembled a sampling of work that all share a kind of productive nihilism that's used in the service of creating a particular special effect. And that is something like nothing, or something next to nothing. It's done through a form of subtraction or obstruction or interference in a world that we naturally sleepwalk through.This is an image that won us a competition for an exhibition pavilion for the Swiss Expo 2002 on Lake Neuchatel, near Geneva. And we wanted to use the water not only as a context, but as a primary building material. We wanted to make an architecture of atmosphere. So, no walls, no roof, no purpose \u2014 just a mass of atomized water, a big cloud. And this proposal was a reaction to the over-saturation of emergent technologies in recent national and world expositions, which feeds, or has been feeding, our insatiable appetite for visual stimulation with an ever greater digital virtuosity. High definition, in our opinion, has become the new orthodoxy. And we ask the question, can we use technology, high technology, to make an expo pavilion that's decidedly low definition, that also challenges the conventions of space and skin, and rethinks our dependence on vision?So this is how we sought to do it. Water's pumped from the lake and is filtered and shot as a fine mist through an array of high-pressure fog nozzles, 35,000 of them. And a weather station is on the structure. It reads the shifting conditions of temperature, humidity, wind direction, wind speed, dew point, and it processes this data in a central computer that calibrates the degree of water pressure and distribution of water throughout. And it's a responsive system that's trained on actual weather. So, this is just in construction, and there's a tensegrity structure. It's about 300 feet wide, the size of a football field, and it sits on just four very delicate columns. These are the fog nozzles, the interface, and basically the system is kind of reading the real weather, and producing kind of semi-artificial and real weather. So, we're very interested in creating weather. I don't know why.Now, here we go, one side, the outside and then from the inside of the space you can see what the quality of the space was. Unlike entering any normal space, entering Blur is like stepping into a habitable medium. It's formless, featureless, depthless, scaleless, massless, purposeless and dimensionless. All references are erased, leaving only an optical whiteout and white noise of the pulsing nozzles. So, this is an exhibition pavilion where there is absolutely nothing to see and nothing to do. And we pride ourselves \u2014 it's a spectacular anti-spectacle in which all the conventions of spectacle are turned on their head. So, the audience is dispersed, focused attention and dramatic build-up and climax are all replaced by a kind of attenuated attention that's sustained by a sense of apprehension caused by the fog. And this is very much like how the Victorian novel used fog in this way. So here the world is put out of focus, while our visual dependence is put into focus. The public, you know, once disoriented can actually ascend to the angel deck above and then just come down under those lips into the water bar. So, all the waters of the world are served there, so we thought that, you know, after being at the water and moving through the water and breathing the water, you could also drink this building.And so it is sort of a theme, but it goes a little bit, you know, deeper than that. We really wanted to bring out our absolute dependence on this master sense, and maybe share our kind of sensibility with our other senses. You know, when we did this project it was a kind of tough sell, because the Swiss said, \"Well, why are we going to spend, you know, 10 million dollars producing an effect that we already have in natural abundance that we hate?\" And, you know, we thought \u2014 well, we tried to convince them. And in the end, you know, they adapted this as a national icon that came to represent Swiss doubt, which we \u2014 you know, it was kind of a meaning machine that everybody kind of laid on their own meanings off of. Anyway, it's a temporary structure that was ultimately destroyed, and so it's now a memory of an apparition, actually, but it continues to live in edible form. And this is the highest honor to be bestowed upon an architect in Switzerland \u2014 to have a chocolate bar.Anyway, moving along. So in the '80s and '90s, we were mostly known for independent work, such as installation artist, architect, commissioned projects by museums and non-for-profit organizations. And we did a lot of media work, also a lot of experimental theater projects. In 2003, the Whitney mounted a retrospective of our work that featured a lot of this work from the '80s and '90s. However, the work itself resisted the very nature of a retrospective, and this is just some of the stuff that was in the show. This was a piece on tourism in the United States. This is \"Soft Sell\" for 42nd Street. This was something done at the Cartier Foundation. \"Master/Slave\" at the MOMA, the project series, a piece called \"Parasite.\" And so there were many, many of these kinds of projects.Anyway, they gave us the whole fourth floor, and, you know, the problem of the retrospective was something we were very uncomfortable with. It's a kind of invention of the museum that's supposed to bring a kind of cohesive understanding to the public of a body of work. And our work doesn't really resolve itself into a body in any way at all. And one of the recurring themes, by the way, that in the work was a kind of hostility toward the museum itself, and asking about the conventions of the museum, like the wall, the white wall. So, what you see here is basically a plan of many installations that were put there. And we actually had to install white walls to separate these pieces, which didn't belong together. But these white walls became a kind of target and weapon at the same time. We used the wall to partition the 13 installations of the project and produce a kind of acoustic and visual separation.And what you see is \u2014 actually, the red dotted line shows the track of this performing element, which was a new piece that created \u2014 that we created for the \u2014 which was a robotic drill, basically, that went all the way around, cruised the museum, went all around the walls and did a lot of damage. So, the drill was mounted on this robotic arm. We worked with, by the way, Honeybee Robotics. This is the brain. Honeybee Robotics designed the Mars Driller, and it was really very much fun to work with them. They weren't doing their primary work, which was for the government, while they were helping us with this. In any case, the way it works is that an intelligent navigator basically maps the entire surface of these walls. So, unfolded it's about 300 linear feet. And it randomly generates points within a three-dimensional matrix. It selects a point, it guides the drill to that point, it pierces the dry wall, leaving a half-inch hole before traveling to the next location. Initially these holes were lone blemishes, and as the exhibition continued the walls became increasingly perforated.So eventually holes on both sides of the wall aligned, opening views from gallery to gallery. Clusters of holes randomly opened up sections of wall. And so this was a three-month performance piece in which the wall was made into kind of an increasingly unstable element. And also the acoustic separation was destroyed. Also the visual separation. And there was also this constant background groan, which was very annoying. And this is one of the blackout spaces where there's a video piece that became totally not useful. So rather than securing a neutral background for the artworks on display, the wall now actively competed for attention. And this acoustical nuisance and visual nuisance basically exposed the discomfort of the work to this encompassing nature of the retrospective. It was really great when it started to break up all of the curatorial text.Moving along to a project that we finished about a year ago. It's the ICA \u2014 the Institute of Contemporary Art \u2014 in Boston, which is on the waterfront. And there's not enough time to really introduce the building, but I'll simply say that the building negotiates between this outwardly focused nature of the site \u2014 you know, it's a really great waterfront site in Boston \u2014 and this contradictory other desire to have an inwardly focused museum. So, the nature of the building is that it looks at looking \u2014 I mean that's its primary objective, both its program and its architectural conceit. The building incorporates the site, but it dispenses it in very small doses in the way that the museum is choreographed. So, you come in and you're basically squeezed by the theater, by the belly of the theater, into this very compressed space where the view is turned off. Then you come up in this glass elevator right near the curtain wall. This elevator's about the size of a New York City studio apartment.And then, this is a view going up, and then you could come into the theater, which can actually deny the view or open it up and become a backdrop. And many musicians choose to use the theater glass walls totally open. The view is denied in the galleries where we receive just natural light, and then exposed again in the north gallery with a panoramic view. The original intention of this space, which was unfortunately never realized, was to use lenticular glass which allowed only a kind of perpendicular view out. In this very narrow space that connects east and west galleries the intention was really to not get a climax, but to have the view stalk you, so the view would open up as you walked from one end to the other. This was eliminated because the view was too good, and the mayor said, \"No, we just want this open.\" The architect lost here.But culminating \u2014 and that's where this hooks into the theme of my little talk \u2014 is this Mediatheque, which is suspended from the cantilevered portion of the building. So this is an 80-foot cantilever \u2014 it's quite substantial. So, it's already sticking out into space enough, and then from that is this, is this small area called the Mediatheque. The Mediatheque has something like 16 stations where the public can get onto the server and look at digital artworks or also curated artworks off the web. And this was really a kind of very important part of this building, and here is a point where architecture \u2014 this is like technology-free \u2014 architecture is only a framing device, it only edits the harbor view, the industrial harbor just through its walls, its floors and its ceiling, to only expose the water itself, the texture of water, much like a hypnotic effect created by electronic snow or a lava lamp or something like that. And here is where we really felt that there was a great convergence of the technological and the natural in the project. But there is just no information, it's just \u2014 it's just hypnosis.Moving along to Lincoln Center. These are the guys that did the project in the first place, 50 years ago. We're taking over now, doing work that ranges in scale from small-scale repairs to major renovations and major facility expansions. But we're doing it with a lot less testosterone. This is the extent of the work that's to be completed by 2010. And for the purposes of this talk, I wanted to isolate just a part of a project that's even a part of a project that touches a little bit on this theme of architectural special effects, and it happens to be our current obsession, and it plays a little bit with the purging and adding of distraction. It's Alice Tully Hall, and it's tucked under the Juilliard Building and descends several levels under the street. So, this is the entrance to Tully Hall as it used to be, before the renovation, which we just started. And we asked ourselves, why couldn't it be exhibitionistic, like the Met, or like some of the other buildings at Lincoln Center? And one of the things that we were asked to do was give it a street identity, expand the lobbies and make it visually accessible. And this building, which is just naturally hermetic, we stripped. We basically did a striptease, architectural striptease, where we're framing with this kind of canopy \u2014 the underside of three levels of expansion of Juilliard, about 45,000 square feet \u2014 cutting it to the angle of Broadway, and then exposing, using that canopy to frame Tully Hall. Before and after shot. (Applause) Wait a minute, it's just in that state, we have a long way to go.But what I wanted to do was take a couple of seconds that I have left to just talk about the hall itself, which is kind of where we're really doing a massive amount of work. So, the hall is a multi-purpose hall. The clients have asked us to produce a great chamber music hall. Now, that's really tough to do with a hall that has 1,100 seats. Chamber and the notion of chamber has to do with salons and small-scale performances. They asked us to bring an intimacy. How do you bring an intimacy into a hall? Intimacy for us means a lot of different things. It means acoustic intimacy and it means visual intimacy.One thing is that the subway is running and rumbling right under the hall. Another thing that could be fixed is the shape of the hall. It's like a coffin, it basically sends all the sound, like a gutter-ball effect, down the aisles. The walls are made of absorptive surface, half absorptive, half reflective, which is not very good for concert sound.This is Avery Fisher Hall, but the notion of junk \u2014 visual junk \u2014 was very, very important to us, to get rid of visual noise. Because we can't eliminate a single seat, the architecture is restricted to 18 inches. So it's a very, very thin architecture. First we do a kind of partial box and box separation, to take away the distraction of the subway noise. Next we wrap the entire hall \u2014 almost like this Olivetti keyboard \u2014 with a material, with a wood material that basically covers all the surfaces: wall, ceiling, floor, stage, steps, everything, boxes. But it's acoustically engineered to focus the sound into the house and back to the stage. And here's an acoustic shelf. Looking up the hall. Just a section of the stage. Just everything is lined, it incorporates \u2014 every single thing that you could possibly imagine is tucked into this high-performance skin. But one more added feature.So now that we've stripped the hall of all visual distraction, everything that prevents this intimacy which is supposed to connect the house, the audience, with the performers, we add one little detail, one piece of architectural excess, a special effect: lighting. We very strongly believe that the theatrics of a concert hall is as much in the space of intermission and the space of arrival as it is when the concert starts. So what we wanted to do was produce this effect, this lighting effect, which made us have to bioengineer the wood walls. And what it entails is the use of resin, of this very thick resin with a veneer of the same kind of wood that's used throughout the hall, in a kind of seamless continuity that wraps the hall in light, like a belt of light: rather than separating, like a proscenium would separate the audience from performers, it connects audience with players.And this is a mockup that is in Salt Lake City that gives you a sense of what this is going to look like in full-scale. And this is a guy from Salt Lake City, this is what they look like out there. (Laughter) And for us, I mean it's really kind of a very strange thing, but the moments in the hall that the buzz kind of dies down when the audience is waiting for the performance to begin, very similar to the parting of curtains or the raising of a chandelier, the walls will just exude this glow, temporarily stealing attention from the stage. And this is Tully in construction now.I have no ending to say, except that I'm a couple of minutes over.Thank you very much.

The work comes in all shapes and sizes.\n\n00:00:30.958 --> 00:00:34.958\nIt's small and large. This is an ashtray, a water glass.\n\n00:00:34.958 --> 00:00:37.958\nFrom urban planning and master planning\n\n00:00:37.958 --> 00:00:41.958\nto theater and all sorts of stuff.\n\n00:00:41.958 --> 00:00:43.958\nThe thing that all the work has in common\n\n00:00:43.958 --> 00:00:48.958\nis that it challenges the assumptions about conventions of space.\n\n00:00:48.958 --> 00:00:50.958\nAnd these are everyday conventions,\n\n00:00:50.958 --> 00:00:55.958\nconventions that are so obvious that we are blinded by their familiarity.\n\n00:00:55.958 --> 00:00:59.958\nAnd I've assembled a sampling of work\n\n00:00:59.958 --> 00:01:03.958\nthat all share a kind of productive nihilism\n\n00:01:03.958 --> 00:01:07.958\nthat's used in the service of creating a particular special effect.\n\n00:01:07.958 --> 00:01:12.958\nAnd that is something like nothing, or something next to nothing.\n\n00:01:13.958 --> 00:01:18.958\nIt's done through a form of subtraction or obstruction or interference\n\n00:01:18.958 --> 00:01:22.958\nin a world that we naturally sleepwalk through.\n\n00:01:22.958 --> 00:01:25.958\nThis is an image that won us a competition\n\n00:01:25.958 --> 00:01:29.958\nfor an exhibition pavilion for the Swiss Expo 2002\n\n00:01:29.958 --> 00:01:31.958\non Lake Neuchatel, near Geneva.\n\n00:01:31.958 --> 00:01:34.958\nAnd we wanted to use the water not only as a context,\n\n00:01:34.958 --> 00:01:36.958\nbut as a primary building material.\n\n00:01:36.958 --> 00:01:39.958\nWe wanted to make an architecture of atmosphere.\n\n00:01:39.958 --> 00:01:42.958\nSo, no walls, no roof, no purpose --\n\n00:01:42.958 --> 00:01:45.958\njust a mass of atomized water, a big cloud.\n\n00:01:45.958 --> 00:01:48.958\nAnd this proposal was a reaction to the over-saturation\n\n00:01:48.958 --> 00:01:53.958\nof emergent technologies in recent national and world expositions,\n\n00:01:53.958 --> 00:01:58.958\nwhich feeds, or has been feeding, our insatiable appetite\n\n00:01:58.958 --> 00:02:04.958\nfor visual stimulation with an ever greater digital virtuosity.\n\n00:02:04.958 --> 00:02:08.958\nHigh definition, in our opinion, has become the new orthodoxy.\n\n00:02:09.958 --> 00:02:13.958\nAnd we ask the question, can we use technology, high technology,\n\n00:02:13.958 --> 00:02:19.958\nto make an expo pavilion that's decidedly low definition,\n\n00:02:19.958 --> 00:02:22.958\nthat also challenges the conventions of space and skin,\n\n00:02:22.958 --> 00:02:24.958\nand rethinks our dependence on vision?\n\n00:02:24.958 --> 00:02:27.958\nSo this is how we sought to do it.\n\n00:02:27.958 --> 00:02:29.958\nWater's pumped from the lake and is filtered\n\n00:02:29.958 --> 00:02:34.958\nand shot as a fine mist through an array of high-pressure fog nozzles,\n\n00:02:34.958 --> 00:02:38.958\n35,000 of them. And a weather station is on the structure.\n\n00:02:38.958 --> 00:02:41.958\nIt reads the shifting conditions of temperature, humidity,\n\n00:02:41.958 --> 00:02:44.958\nwind direction, wind speed, dew point,\n\n00:02:44.958 --> 00:02:47.958\nand it processes this data in a central computer\n\n00:02:47.958 --> 00:02:50.958\nthat calibrates the degree of water pressure\n\n00:02:50.958 --> 00:02:52.958\nand distribution of water throughout.\n\n00:02:52.958 --> 00:02:57.958\nAnd it's a responsive system that's trained on actual weather.\n\n00:02:57.958 --> 00:03:01.958\nSo, this is just in construction, and there's a tensegrity structure.\n\n00:03:01.958 --> 00:03:04.958\nIt's about 300 feet wide, the size of a football field,\n\n00:03:04.958 --> 00:03:08.958\nand it sits on just four very delicate columns.\n\n00:03:08.958 --> 00:03:11.958\nThese are the fog nozzles, the interface,\n\n00:03:11.958 --> 00:03:15.958\nand basically the system is kind of reading the real weather,\n\n00:03:15.958 --> 00:03:19.958\nand producing kind of semi-artificial and real weather.\n\n00:03:19.958 --> 00:03:23.958\nSo, we're very interested in creating weather. I don't know why.\n\n00:03:23.958 --> 00:03:26.958\nNow, here we go, one side, the outside\n\n00:03:26.958 --> 00:03:28.958\nand then from the inside of the space\n\n00:03:28.958 --> 00:03:30.958\nyou can see what the quality of the space was.\n\n00:03:30.958 --> 00:03:33.958\nUnlike entering any normal space,\n\n00:03:33.958 --> 00:03:37.958\nentering Blur is like stepping into a habitable medium.\n\n00:03:37.958 --> 00:03:42.958\nIt's formless, featureless, depthless, scaleless, massless,\n\n00:03:42.958 --> 00:03:44.958\npurposeless and dimensionless.\n\n00:03:44.958 --> 00:03:47.958\nAll references are erased,\n\n00:03:47.958 --> 00:03:53.958\nleaving only an optical whiteout and white noise of the pulsing nozzles.\n\n00:03:53.958 --> 00:03:56.958\nSo, this is an exhibition pavilion\n\n00:03:56.958 --> 00:03:59.958\nwhere there is absolutely nothing to see and nothing to do.\n\n00:04:00.958 --> 00:04:06.958\nAnd we pride ourselves -- it's a spectacular anti-spectacle\n\n00:04:06.958 --> 00:04:10.958\nin which all the conventions of spectacle are turned on their head.\n\n00:04:10.958 --> 00:04:12.958\nSo, the audience is dispersed,\n\n00:04:12.958 --> 00:04:15.958\nfocused attention and dramatic build-up and climax\n\n00:04:15.958 --> 00:04:18.958\nare all replaced by a kind of attenuated attention\n\n00:04:18.958 --> 00:04:22.958\nthat's sustained by a sense of apprehension caused by the fog.\n\n00:04:22.958 --> 00:04:28.958\nAnd this is very much like how the Victorian novel used fog in this way.\n\n00:04:28.958 --> 00:04:31.958\nSo here the world is put out of focus,\n\n00:04:31.958 --> 00:04:34.958\nwhile our visual dependence is put into focus.\n\n00:04:35.958 --> 00:04:38.958\nThe public, you know, once disoriented\n\n00:04:38.958 --> 00:04:42.958\ncan actually ascend to the angel deck above\n\n00:04:42.958 --> 00:04:45.958\nand then just come down under those lips into the water bar.\n\n00:04:45.958 --> 00:04:47.958\nSo, all the waters of the world are served there,\n\n00:04:47.958 --> 00:04:51.958\nso we thought that, you know, after being at the water\n\n00:04:51.958 --> 00:04:54.958\nand moving through the water and breathing the water,\n\n00:04:54.958 --> 00:04:57.958\nyou could also drink this building.\n\n00:04:57.958 --> 00:05:01.958\nAnd so it is sort of a theme,\n\n00:05:01.958 --> 00:05:04.958\nbut it goes a little bit, you know, deeper than that.\n\n00:05:04.958 --> 00:05:06.958\nWe really wanted to bring out\n\n00:05:06.958 --> 00:05:10.958\nour absolute dependence on this master sense,\n\n00:05:10.958 --> 00:05:14.958\nand maybe share our kind of sensibility with our other senses.\n\n00:05:14.958 --> 00:05:18.958\nYou know, when we did this project it was a kind of tough sell,\n\n00:05:18.958 --> 00:05:20.958\nbecause the Swiss said, \"Well, why are we going to spend, you know,\n\n00:05:20.958 --> 00:05:24.958\n10 million dollars producing an effect\n\n00:05:24.958 --> 00:05:26.958\nthat we already have in natural abundance that we hate?\"\n\n00:05:26.958 --> 00:05:31.958\nAnd, you know, we thought -- well, we tried to convince them.\n\n00:05:31.958 --> 00:05:37.958\nAnd in the end, you know, they adapted this as a national icon\n\n00:05:37.958 --> 00:05:42.958\nthat came to represent Swiss doubt, which we -- you know,\n\n00:05:42.958 --> 00:05:44.958\nit was kind of a meaning machine\n\n00:05:44.958 --> 00:05:46.958\nthat everybody kind of laid on their own meanings off of.\n\n00:05:46.958 --> 00:05:49.958\nAnyway, it's a temporary structure that was ultimately destroyed,\n\n00:05:49.958 --> 00:05:53.958\nand so it's now a memory of an apparition, actually,\n\n00:05:53.958 --> 00:05:56.958\nbut it continues to live in edible form.\n\n00:05:56.958 --> 00:05:58.958\nAnd this is the highest honor\n\n00:05:58.958 --> 00:06:03.958\nto be bestowed upon an architect in Switzerland -- to have a chocolate bar.\n\n00:06:03.958 --> 00:06:05.958\nAnyway, moving along.\n\n00:06:05.958 --> 00:06:10.958\nSo in the '80s and '90s, we were mostly known for independent work,\n\n00:06:10.958 --> 00:06:14.958\nsuch as installation artist, architect,\n\n00:06:14.958 --> 00:06:19.958\ncommissioned projects by museums and non-for-profit organizations.\n\n00:06:19.958 --> 00:06:22.958\nAnd we did a lot of media work,\n\n00:06:22.958 --> 00:06:24.958\nalso a lot of experimental theater projects.\n\n00:06:24.958 --> 00:06:29.958\nIn 2003, the Whitney mounted a retrospective of our work\n\n00:06:29.958 --> 00:06:32.958\nthat featured a lot of this work from the '80s and '90s.\n\n00:06:33.958 --> 00:06:39.958\nHowever, the work itself resisted the very nature of a retrospective,\n\n00:06:39.958 --> 00:06:42.958\nand this is just some of the stuff that was in the show.\n\n00:06:42.958 --> 00:06:45.958\nThis was a piece on tourism in the United States.\n\n00:06:45.958 --> 00:06:48.958\nThis is \"Soft Sell\" for 42nd Street.\n\n00:06:48.958 --> 00:06:51.958\nThis was something done at the Cartier Foundation.\n\n00:06:51.958 --> 00:06:56.958\n\"Master/Slave\" at the MOMA, the project series, a piece called \"Parasite.\"\n\n00:06:56.958 --> 00:06:59.958\nAnd so there were many, many of these kinds of projects.\n\n00:06:59.958 --> 00:07:05.958\nAnyway, they gave us the whole fourth floor, and, you know,\n\n00:07:05.958 --> 00:07:07.958\nthe problem of the retrospective\n\n00:07:07.958 --> 00:07:09.958\nwas something we were very uncomfortable with.\n\n00:07:09.958 --> 00:07:11.958\nIt's a kind of invention of the museum\n\n00:07:11.958 --> 00:07:15.958\nthat's supposed to bring a kind of cohesive understanding\n\n00:07:15.958 --> 00:07:17.958\nto the public of a body of work.\n\n00:07:17.958 --> 00:07:22.958\nAnd our work doesn't really resolve itself into a body in any way at all.\n\n00:07:22.958 --> 00:07:27.958\nAnd one of the recurring themes, by the way, that in the work\n\n00:07:27.958 --> 00:07:30.958\nwas a kind of hostility toward the museum itself,\n\n00:07:30.958 --> 00:07:35.958\nand asking about the conventions of the museum, like the wall, the white wall.\n\n00:07:35.958 --> 00:07:37.958\nSo, what you see here\n\n00:07:37.958 --> 00:07:40.958\nis basically a plan of many installations that were put there.\n\n00:07:40.958 --> 00:07:43.958\nAnd we actually had to install white walls\n\n00:07:43.958 --> 00:07:45.958\nto separate these pieces, which didn't belong together.\n\n00:07:45.958 --> 00:07:50.958\nBut these white walls became a kind of target and weapon at the same time.\n\n00:07:50.958 --> 00:07:53.958\nWe used the wall to partition the 13 installations of the project\n\n00:07:53.958 --> 00:07:57.958\nand produce a kind of acoustic and visual separation.\n\n00:07:58.958 --> 00:08:00.958\nAnd what you see is -- actually,\n\n00:08:00.958 --> 00:08:05.958\nthe red dotted line shows the track of this performing element,\n\n00:08:05.958 --> 00:08:08.958\nwhich was a new piece that created -- that we created for the --\n\n00:08:08.958 --> 00:08:12.958\nwhich was a robotic drill, basically, that went all the way around,\n\n00:08:12.958 --> 00:08:17.958\ncruised the museum, went all around the walls and did a lot of damage.\n\n00:08:18.958 --> 00:08:21.958\nSo, the drill was mounted on this robotic arm.\n\n00:08:21.958 --> 00:08:25.958\nWe worked with, by the way, Honeybee Robotics. This is the brain.\n\n00:08:25.958 --> 00:08:28.958\nHoneybee Robotics designed the Mars Driller,\n\n00:08:28.958 --> 00:08:30.958\nand it was really very much fun to work with them.\n\n00:08:30.958 --> 00:08:34.958\nThey weren't doing their primary work, which was for the government,\n\n00:08:34.958 --> 00:08:37.958\nwhile they were helping us with this.\n\n00:08:37.958 --> 00:08:39.958\nIn any case, the way it works is that\n\n00:08:39.958 --> 00:08:45.958\nan intelligent navigator basically maps the entire surface of these walls.\n\n00:08:45.958 --> 00:08:48.958\nSo, unfolded it's about 300 linear feet.\n\n00:08:48.958 --> 00:08:52.958\nAnd it randomly generates points within a three-dimensional matrix.\n\n00:08:52.958 --> 00:08:57.958\nIt selects a point, it guides the drill to that point, it pierces the dry wall,\n\n00:08:57.958 --> 00:09:01.958\nleaving a half-inch hole before traveling to the next location.\n\n00:09:02.958 --> 00:09:06.958\nInitially these holes were lone blemishes,\n\n00:09:06.958 --> 00:09:08.958\nand as the exhibition continued\n\n00:09:08.958 --> 00:09:11.958\nthe walls became increasingly perforated.\n\n00:09:11.958 --> 00:09:14.958\nSo eventually holes on both sides of the wall aligned,\n\n00:09:14.958 --> 00:09:16.958\nopening views from gallery to gallery.\n\n00:09:16.958 --> 00:09:20.958\nClusters of holes randomly opened up sections of wall.\n\n00:09:20.958 --> 00:09:23.958\nAnd so this was a three-month performance piece\n\n00:09:23.958 --> 00:09:29.958\nin which the wall was made into kind of an increasingly unstable element.\n\n00:09:30.958 --> 00:09:33.958\nAnd also the acoustic separation was destroyed.\n\n00:09:34.958 --> 00:09:36.958\nAlso the visual separation.\n\n00:09:36.958 --> 00:09:42.958\nAnd there was also this constant background groan, which was very annoying.\n\n00:09:42.958 --> 00:09:44.958\nAnd this is one of the blackout spaces\n\n00:09:44.958 --> 00:09:47.958\nwhere there's a video piece that became totally not useful.\n\n00:09:47.958 --> 00:09:51.958\nSo rather than securing a neutral background for the artworks on display,\n\n00:09:51.958 --> 00:09:54.958\nthe wall now actively competed for attention.\n\n00:09:55.958 --> 00:09:59.958\nAnd this acoustical nuisance and visual nuisance\n\n00:09:59.958 --> 00:10:02.958\nbasically exposed the discomfort of the work\n\n00:10:02.958 --> 00:10:07.958\nto this encompassing nature of the retrospective.\n\n00:10:08.958 --> 00:10:12.958\nIt was really great when it started to break up all of the curatorial text.\n\n00:10:12.958 --> 00:10:16.958\nMoving along to a project that we finished about a year ago.\n\n00:10:16.958 --> 00:10:21.958\nIt's the ICA -- the Institute of Contemporary Art -- in Boston,\n\n00:10:21.958 --> 00:10:23.958\nwhich is on the waterfront.\n\n00:10:23.958 --> 00:10:26.958\nAnd there's not enough time to really introduce the building,\n\n00:10:26.958 --> 00:10:28.958\nbut I'll simply say that the building negotiates\n\n00:10:28.958 --> 00:10:34.958\nbetween this outwardly focused nature of the site --\n\n00:10:34.958 --> 00:10:37.958\nyou know, it's a really great waterfront site in Boston --\n\n00:10:37.958 --> 00:10:42.958\nand this contradictory other desire to have an inwardly focused museum.\n\n00:10:42.958 --> 00:10:46.958\nSo, the nature of the building is that it looks at looking --\n\n00:10:46.958 --> 00:10:48.958\nI mean that's its primary objective,\n\n00:10:49.958 --> 00:10:53.958\nboth its program and its architectural conceit.\n\n00:10:55.958 --> 00:10:59.958\nThe building incorporates the site,\n\n00:10:59.958 --> 00:11:03.958\nbut it dispenses it in very small doses\n\n00:11:03.958 --> 00:11:06.958\nin the way that the museum is choreographed.\n\n00:11:06.958 --> 00:11:10.958\nSo, you come in and you're basically squeezed by the theater,\n\n00:11:10.958 --> 00:11:12.958\nby the belly of the theater, into this very compressed space\n\n00:11:12.958 --> 00:11:14.958\nwhere the view is turned off.\n\n00:11:14.958 --> 00:11:19.958\nThen you come up in this glass elevator right near the curtain wall.\n\n00:11:19.958 --> 00:11:23.958\nThis elevator's about the size of a New York City studio apartment.\n\n00:11:23.958 --> 00:11:25.958\nAnd then, this is a view going up,\n\n00:11:25.958 --> 00:11:27.958\nand then you could come into the theater,\n\n00:11:27.958 --> 00:11:32.958\nwhich can actually deny the view or open it up and become a backdrop.\n\n00:11:32.958 --> 00:11:38.958\nAnd many musicians choose to use the theater glass walls totally open.\n\n00:11:38.958 --> 00:11:40.958\nThe view is denied in the galleries\n\n00:11:40.958 --> 00:11:43.958\nwhere we receive just natural light,\n\n00:11:43.958 --> 00:11:48.958\nand then exposed again in the north gallery with a panoramic view.\n\n00:11:48.958 --> 00:11:50.958\nThe original intention of this space,\n\n00:11:50.958 --> 00:11:53.958\nwhich was unfortunately never realized,\n\n00:11:53.958 --> 00:11:55.958\nwas to use lenticular glass\n\n00:11:55.958 --> 00:11:58.958\nwhich allowed only a kind of perpendicular view out.\n\n00:11:58.958 --> 00:12:01.958\nIn this very narrow space that connects east and west galleries\n\n00:12:01.958 --> 00:12:05.958\nthe intention was really to not get a climax,\n\n00:12:05.958 --> 00:12:07.958\nbut to have the view stalk you,\n\n00:12:07.958 --> 00:12:11.958\nso the view would open up as you walked from one end to the other.\n\n00:12:11.958 --> 00:12:14.958\nThis was eliminated because the view was too good,\n\n00:12:14.958 --> 00:12:17.958\nand the mayor said, \"No, we just want this open.\"\n\n00:12:17.958 --> 00:12:19.958\nThe architect lost here.\n\n00:12:19.958 --> 00:12:22.958\nBut culminating -- and that's where this hooks into the theme of my little talk --\n\n00:12:22.958 --> 00:12:24.958\nis this Mediatheque,\n\n00:12:24.958 --> 00:12:28.958\nwhich is suspended from the cantilevered portion of the building.\n\n00:12:28.958 --> 00:12:31.958\nSo this is an 80-foot cantilever -- it's quite substantial.\n\n00:12:31.958 --> 00:12:35.958\nSo, it's already sticking out into space enough,\n\n00:12:35.958 --> 00:12:40.958\nand then from that is this, is this small area called the Mediatheque.\n\n00:12:40.958 --> 00:12:44.958\nThe Mediatheque has something like 16 stations\n\n00:12:44.958 --> 00:12:46.958\nwhere the public can get onto the server\n\n00:12:46.958 --> 00:12:50.958\nand look at digital artworks or also curated artworks off the web.\n\n00:12:50.958 --> 00:12:57.958\nAnd this was really a kind of very important part of this building,\n\n00:12:57.958 --> 00:12:59.958\nand here is a point where architecture --\n\n00:12:59.958 --> 00:13:03.958\nthis is like technology-free -- architecture is only a framing device,\n\n00:13:03.958 --> 00:13:06.958\nit only edits the harbor view, the industrial harbor\n\n00:13:07.958 --> 00:13:11.958\njust through its walls, its floors and its ceiling,\n\n00:13:11.958 --> 00:13:17.958\nto only expose the water itself, the texture of water,\n\n00:13:17.958 --> 00:13:21.958\nmuch like a hypnotic effect created by electronic snow\n\n00:13:21.958 --> 00:13:24.958\nor a lava lamp or something like that.\n\n00:13:24.958 --> 00:13:28.958\nAnd here is where we really felt that there was a great convergence\n\n00:13:28.958 --> 00:13:32.958\nof the technological and the natural in the project.\n\n00:13:33.958 --> 00:13:39.958\nBut there is just no information, it's just -- it's just hypnosis.\n\n00:13:40.958 --> 00:13:42.958\nMoving along to Lincoln Center.\n\n00:13:43.958 --> 00:13:47.958\nThese are the guys that did the project in the first place, 50 years ago.\n\n00:13:47.958 --> 00:13:50.958\nWe're taking over now, doing work that ranges in scale\n\n00:13:50.958 --> 00:13:56.958\nfrom small-scale repairs to major renovations and major facility expansions.\n\n00:13:56.958 --> 00:13:59.958\nBut we're doing it with a lot less testosterone.\n\n00:13:59.958 --> 00:14:04.958\nThis is the extent of the work that's to be completed by 2010.\n\n00:14:04.958 --> 00:14:06.958\nAnd for the purposes of this talk,\n\n00:14:06.958 --> 00:14:10.958\nI wanted to isolate just a part of a project that's even a part of a project\n\n00:14:10.958 --> 00:14:14.958\nthat touches a little bit on this theme of architectural special effects,\n\n00:14:14.958 --> 00:14:18.958\nand it happens to be our current obsession,\n\n00:14:18.958 --> 00:14:24.958\nand it plays a little bit with the purging and adding of distraction.\n\n00:14:24.958 --> 00:14:28.958\nIt's Alice Tully Hall, and it's tucked under the Juilliard Building\n\n00:14:28.958 --> 00:14:32.958\nand descends several levels under the street.\n\n00:14:32.958 --> 00:14:36.958\nSo, this is the entrance to Tully Hall as it used to be,\n\n00:14:36.958 --> 00:14:38.958\nbefore the renovation, which we just started.\n\n00:14:38.958 --> 00:14:41.958\nAnd we asked ourselves, why couldn't it be exhibitionistic,\n\n00:14:41.958 --> 00:14:44.958\nlike the Met, or like some of the other buildings at Lincoln Center?\n\n00:14:44.958 --> 00:14:47.958\nAnd one of the things that we were asked to do\n\n00:14:47.958 --> 00:14:52.958\nwas give it a street identity, expand the lobbies and make it visually accessible.\n\n00:14:52.958 --> 00:14:56.958\nAnd this building, which is just naturally hermetic, we stripped.\n\n00:14:56.958 --> 00:14:59.958\nWe basically did a striptease, architectural striptease,\n\n00:14:59.958 --> 00:15:04.958\nwhere we're framing with this kind of canopy --\n\n00:15:04.958 --> 00:15:07.958\nthe underside of three levels of expansion of Juilliard,\n\n00:15:07.958 --> 00:15:12.958\nabout 45,000 square feet -- cutting it to the angle of Broadway,\n\n00:15:12.958 --> 00:15:17.958\nand then exposing, using that canopy to frame Tully Hall.\n\n00:15:17.958 --> 00:15:20.958\nBefore and after shot. (Applause)\n\n00:15:21.958 --> 00:15:25.958\nWait a minute, it's just in that state, we have a long way to go.\n\n00:15:25.958 --> 00:15:28.958\nBut what I wanted to do was take a couple of seconds that I have left\n\n00:15:28.958 --> 00:15:30.958\nto just talk about the hall itself,\n\n00:15:30.958 --> 00:15:34.958\nwhich is kind of where we're really doing a massive amount of work.\n\n00:15:34.958 --> 00:15:37.958\nSo, the hall is a multi-purpose hall.\n\n00:15:37.958 --> 00:15:42.958\nThe clients have asked us to produce a great chamber music hall.\n\n00:15:42.958 --> 00:15:46.958\nNow, that's really tough to do with a hall that has 1,100 seats.\n\n00:15:46.958 --> 00:15:49.958\nChamber and the notion of chamber has to do with salons\n\n00:15:49.958 --> 00:15:52.958\nand small-scale performances. They asked us to bring an intimacy.\n\n00:15:52.958 --> 00:15:55.958\nHow do you bring an intimacy into a hall?\n\n00:15:55.958 --> 00:15:57.958\nIntimacy for us means a lot of different things.\n\n00:15:57.958 --> 00:16:01.958\nIt means acoustic intimacy and it means visual intimacy.\n\n00:16:01.958 --> 00:16:05.958\nOne thing is that the subway is running and rumbling right under the hall.\n\n00:16:05.958 --> 00:16:07.958\nAnother thing that could be fixed is the shape of the hall.\n\n00:16:07.958 --> 00:16:10.958\nIt's like a coffin, it basically sends all the sound,\n\n00:16:10.958 --> 00:16:12.958\nlike a gutter-ball effect, down the aisles.\n\n00:16:12.958 --> 00:16:15.958\nThe walls are made of absorptive surface,\n\n00:16:15.958 --> 00:16:17.958\nhalf absorptive, half reflective,\n\n00:16:17.958 --> 00:16:20.958\nwhich is not very good for concert sound.\n\n00:16:20.958 --> 00:16:24.958\nThis is Avery Fisher Hall, but the notion of junk -- visual junk --\n\n00:16:24.958 --> 00:16:28.958\nwas very, very important to us, to get rid of visual noise.\n\n00:16:28.958 --> 00:16:30.958\nBecause we can't eliminate a single seat,\n\n00:16:30.958 --> 00:16:33.958\nthe architecture is restricted to 18 inches.\n\n00:16:33.958 --> 00:16:36.958\nSo it's a very, very thin architecture.\n\n00:16:36.958 --> 00:16:40.958\nFirst we do a kind of partial box and box separation,\n\n00:16:40.958 --> 00:16:42.958\nto take away the distraction of the subway noise.\n\n00:16:42.958 --> 00:16:47.958\nNext we wrap the entire hall -- almost like this Olivetti keyboard --\n\n00:16:47.958 --> 00:16:50.958\nwith a material, with a wood material\n\n00:16:50.958 --> 00:16:52.958\nthat basically covers all the surfaces:\n\n00:16:52.958 --> 00:16:56.958\nwall, ceiling, floor, stage, steps, everything, boxes.\n\n00:16:56.958 --> 00:17:00.958\nBut it's acoustically engineered to focus the sound into the house\n\n00:17:00.958 --> 00:17:03.958\nand back to the stage. And here's an acoustic shelf.\n\n00:17:03.958 --> 00:17:06.958\nLooking up the hall. Just a section of the stage.\n\n00:17:06.958 --> 00:17:09.958\nJust everything is lined, it incorporates --\n\n00:17:09.958 --> 00:17:11.958\nevery single thing that you could possibly imagine\n\n00:17:11.958 --> 00:17:13.958\nis tucked into this high-performance skin.\n\n00:17:13.958 --> 00:17:15.958\nBut one more added feature.\n\n00:17:15.958 --> 00:17:18.958\nSo now that we've stripped the hall of all visual distraction,\n\n00:17:18.958 --> 00:17:21.958\neverything that prevents this intimacy\n\n00:17:21.958 --> 00:17:24.958\nwhich is supposed to connect the house, the audience,\n\n00:17:24.958 --> 00:17:28.958\nwith the performers, we add one little detail,\n\n00:17:28.958 --> 00:17:32.958\none piece of architectural excess, a special effect: lighting.\n\n00:17:32.958 --> 00:17:36.958\nWe very strongly believe that the theatrics of a concert hall\n\n00:17:36.958 --> 00:17:40.958\nis as much in the space of intermission and the space of arrival\n\n00:17:40.958 --> 00:17:42.958\nas it is when the concert starts.\n\n00:17:42.958 --> 00:17:46.958\nSo what we wanted to do was produce this effect,\n\n00:17:46.958 --> 00:17:48.958\nthis lighting effect,\n\n00:17:48.958 --> 00:17:52.958\nwhich made us have to bioengineer the wood walls.\n\n00:17:52.958 --> 00:17:58.958\nAnd what it entails is the use of resin, of this very thick resin\n\n00:17:58.958 --> 00:18:02.958\nwith a veneer of the same kind of wood that's used throughout the hall,\n\n00:18:02.958 --> 00:18:06.958\nin a kind of seamless continuity\n\n00:18:06.958 --> 00:18:11.958\nthat wraps the hall in light, like a belt of light: rather than separating,\n\n00:18:11.958 --> 00:18:15.958\nlike a proscenium would separate the audience from performers,\n\n00:18:15.958 --> 00:18:17.958\nit connects audience with players.\n\n00:18:17.958 --> 00:18:23.958\nAnd this is a mockup that is in Salt Lake City\n\n00:18:23.958 --> 00:18:28.958\nthat gives you a sense of what this is going to look like in full-scale.\n\n00:18:28.958 --> 00:18:31.958\nAnd this is a guy from Salt Lake City,\n\n00:18:31.958 --> 00:18:33.958\nthis is what they look like out there.\n\n00:18:33.958 --> 00:18:36.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:18:36.958 --> 00:18:39.958\nAnd for us, I mean it's really kind of a very strange thing,\n\n00:18:39.958 --> 00:18:45.958\nbut the moments in the hall that the buzz kind of dies down\n\n00:18:45.958 --> 00:18:48.958\nwhen the audience is waiting for the performance to begin,\n\n00:18:48.958 --> 00:18:52.958\nvery similar to the parting of curtains or the raising of a chandelier,\n\n00:18:52.958 --> 00:18:58.958\nthe walls will just exude this glow, temporarily stealing attention from the stage.\n\n00:18:58.958 --> 00:19:02.958\nAnd this is Tully in construction now.\n\n00:19:02.958 --> 00:19:06.958\nI have no ending to say, except that I'm a couple of minutes over.\n\n00:19:06.958 --> 00:19:08.958\nThank you very much.\n\n00:19:08.958 --> 00:19:10.958\n(Applause)"}, {"title": "Moving photos of extreme drug-resistant TB", "duration": "352", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/james_nachtwey_fights_xdrtb", "transcript": "I was a student in the '60s, a time of social upheaval and questioning, and \u2014 on a personal level \u2014 an awakening sense of idealism.

This was me running around in the back garden mid-summer.(Laughter)I couldn't pick a career. In Ireland the obvious choice is the military, but to be honest it actually kind of sucks.(Laughter)My mother wanted me to be a dentist. But the problem was that people kept blowing everything up. So I actually went to school in Belfast, which was where all the action happened. And this was a pretty common sight. The school I went to was pretty boring. They forced us to learn things like Latin. The school teachers weren't having much fun, the sports were very dirty or very painful. So I cleverly chose rowing, which I got very good at.And I was actually rowing for my school here until this fateful day, and I flipped over right in front of the entire school. And that was the finishing post right there.(Laughter)So this was extremely embarrassing. But our school at that time got a grant from the government, and they got an incredible computer \u2014 the research machine 3DZ \u2014 and they left the programming manuals lying around. And so students like myself with nothing to do, we would learn how to program it. Also around this time, at home, this was the computer that people were buying. It was called the Sinclair ZX80. This was a 1K computer, and you'd buy your programs on cassette tape.Actually I'm just going to pause for one second, because I heard that there's a prerequisite to speak here at TED \u2014 you had to have a picture of yourself from the old days with big hair. So I brought a picture with big hair.(Laughter).I just want to get that out of the way. So after the Sinclair ZX80 came along the very cleverly named Sinclair ZX81.(Laughter)And \u2014 you see the picture at the bottom? There's a picture of a guy doing homework with his son. That's what they thought they had built it for. The reality is we got the programming manual and we started making games for it. We were programming in BASIC, which is a pretty awful language for games, so we ended up learning Assembly language so we could really take control of the hardware. This is the guy that invented it, Sir Clive Sinclair, and he's showing his machine. You had this same thing in America, it was called the Timex Sinclair1000.To play a game in those days you had to have an imagination to believe that you were really playing \"Battlestar Galactica.\" The graphics were just horrible. You had to have an even better imagination to play this game, \"Death Rider.\" But of course the scientists couldn't help themselves. They started making their own video games. This is one of my favorite ones here, where they have rabbit breeding, so males choose the lucky rabbit.It was around this time we went from 1K to 16K, which was quite the leap. And if you're wondering how much 16K is, this eBay logo here is 16K. And in that amount of memory someone programmed a full flight simulation program. And that's what it looked like. I spent ages flying this flight simulator, and I honestly believed I could fly airplanes by the end of it.Here's Clive Sinclair now launching his color computer. He's recognized as being the father of video games in Europe. He's a multi-millionaire, and I think that's why he's smiling in this photograph.So I went on for the next 20 years or so making a lot of different games. Some of the highlights were things like \"The Terminator,\" \"Aladdin,\" the \"Teenage Mutant Hero Turtles.\" Because I was from the United Kingdom, they thought the word ninja was a little too mean for children, so they decided to call it hero instead. I personally preferred the Spanish version, which was \"Tortugas Ninja.\" That was much better.(Laughter)Then the last game I did was based on trying to get the video game industry and Hollywood to actually work together on something \u2014 instead of licensing from each other, to actually work.Now, Chris did ask me to bring some statistics with me, so I've done that. The video game industry in 2005 became a 29 billion dollar business. It grows every year. Last year was the biggest year. By 2008, we're going to kick the butt of the music industry. By 2010, we're going to hit 42 billion. 43 percent of gamers are female. So there's a lot more female gamers than people are really aware.The average age of gamers? Well, obviously it's for children, right? Well, no, actually it's 30 years old. And interestingly, the people who buy the most games are 37. So 37 is our target audience. All video games are violent. Of course the newspapers love to beat on this. But 83 percent of games don't have any mature content whatsoever, so it's just not true.Online gaming statistics. I brought some stuff on \"World of Warcraft.\" It's 5.5 million players. It makes about 80 million bucks a month in subscriptions. It costs 50 bucks just to install it on your computer, making the publisher about another 275 million. The game costs about 80 million dollars to make, so basically it pays for itself in about a month. A player in a game called \"Project Entropia\" actually bought his own island for 26,500 dollars. You have to remember that this is not a real island. He didn't actually buy anything, just some data. But he got great terms on it. This purchase included mining and hunting rights, ownership of all land on the island, and a castle with no furniture included.(Laughter)This market is now estimated at over 800 million dollars annually. And what's interesting about it is the market was actually created by the gamers themselves. They found clever ways to trade items and to sell their accounts to each other so that they could make money while they were playing their games. I dove onto eBay a couple of days ago just to see what was gong on, typed in World of Warcraft, got 6,000 items. I liked this one the best: a level 60 Warlock with lots of epics for 174,000 dollars. It's like that guy obviously had some pain while making it.So as far as popularity of games, what do you think these people are doing here? It turns out they're actually in Hollywood Bowl in Los Angeles listening to the L.A. Philharmonic playing video game music. That's what the show looks like. You would expect it to be cheesy, but it's not. It's very, very epic and a very beautiful concert. And the people that went there absolutely loved it.What do you think these people are doing? They're actually bringing their computers so they can play games against each other. And this is happening in every city around the world. This is happening in your local cities too, you're probably just not aware of it.Now, Chris told me that you had a timeline video a few years ago here just to show how video game graphics have been improving. I wanted to update that video and give you a new look at it. But what I want you to do is to try to understand it. We're on this curve, and the graphics are getting so ridiculously better. And I'm going to show you up to maybe 2007. But I want you to try and think about what games could look like 10 years from now. So we're going to start that video.Video: Throughout human history people have played games. As man's intellect and technology have evolved so too have the games he plays.(Music)(Applause)David Perry: The thing again I want you to think about is, don't look at these graphics and think of that's the way it is. Think about that's where we are right now, and the curve that we're on means that this is going to continue to get better. This is an example of the kind of graphics you need to be able to draw if you wanted to get a job in the video game industry today. You need to be really an incredible artist. And once we get enough of those guys, we're going to want more fantasy artists that can create places we've never been to before, or characters that we've just never seen before.So the obvious thing for me to talk about today is graphics and audio. But if you were to go to a game developers conference, what they're all talking about is emotion, purpose, meaning, understanding and feeling. You'll hear about talks like, can a video game make you cry? And these are the kind of topics we really actually care about.I came across a student who's absolutely excellent at expressing himself, and this student agreed that he would not show his video to anybody until you here at TED had seen it. So I'd like to play this video. So this is a student's opinion on what his experience of games are.Video: I, like many of you, live somewhere between reality and video games. Some part of me \u2014 a true living, breathing person \u2014 has become programmed, electronic and virtual. The boundary of my brain that divides real from fantasy has finally begun to crumble. I'm a video game addict and this is my story.(Music)In the year of my birth the Nintendo Entertainment System also went into development. I played in the backyard, learned to read, and even ate some of my vegetables. Most of my childhood was spent playing with Legos. But as was the case for most of my generation, I spent a lot of time in front of the TV. Mr. Rogers, Walt Disney, Nick Junior, and roughly half a million commercials have undoubtedly left their mark on me.When my parents bought my sister and I our first Nintendo, whatever inherent addictive quality this early interactive electronic entertainment possessed quickly took hold of me. At some point something clicked.(Music)With the combination of simple, interactive stories and the warmth of the TV set, my simple 16-bit Nintendo became more than just an escape. It became an alternate existence, my virtual reality.(Music)I'm a video game addict, and it's not because of a certain number of hours I have spent playing, or nights I have gone without sleep to finish the next level. It is because I have had life-altering experiences in virtual space, and video games had begun to erode my own understanding of what is real and what is not. I'm addicted, because even though I know I'm losing my grip on reality, I still crave more.(Music)From an early age I learned to invest myself emotionally in what unfolded before me on screen. Today, after 20 years of watching TV geared to make me emotional, even a decent insurance commercial can bring tears to my eyes. I am just one of a new generation that is growing up. A generation who may experience much more meaning through video games than they will through the real world. Video games are nearing an evolutionary leap, a point where game worlds will look and feel just as real as the films we see in theatres, or the news we watch on TV. And while my sense of free will in these virtual worlds may still be limited, what I do learn applies to my real life. Play enough video games and eventually you will really believe you can snowboard, fly a plane, drive a nine-second quarter mile, or kill a man. I know I can.Unlike any pop culture phenomenon before it, video games actually allow us to become part of the machine. They allow us to sublimate into the culture of interactive, downloaded, streaming, HD reality. We are interacting with our entertainment. I have come to expect this level of interaction. Without it, the problems faced in the real world \u2014 poverty, war, disease and genocide \u2014 lack the levity they should. Their importance blends into the sensationalized drama of prime time TV.But the beauty of video games today lies not in the lifelike graphics, the vibrating joysticks or virtual surround sound. It lies in that these games are beginning to make me emotional. I have fought in wars, feared for my own survival, watched my cohorts die on beaches and woods that look and feel more real than any textbook or any news story.The people who create these games are smart. They know what makes me scared, excited, panicked, proud or sad. Then they use these emotions to dimensionalize the worlds they create. A well-designed video game will seamlessly weave the user into the fabric of the virtual experience. As one becomes more experienced the awareness of physical control melts away. I know what I want and I do it. No buttons to push, no triggers to pull, just me and the game. My fate and the fate of the world around me lie inside my hands. I know violent video games make my mother worry. What troubles me is not that video game violence is becoming more and more like real life violence, but that real life violence is starting to look more and more like a video game.(Music)These are all troubles outside of myself. I, however, have a problem very close to home. Something has happened to my brain.(Music)Perhaps there is a single part of our brain that holds all of our gut instincts, the things we know to do before we even think. While some of these instincts may be innate, most are learned, and all of them are hardwired into our brains. These instincts are essential for survival in both real and virtual worlds. Only in recent years has the technology behind video games allowed for a true overlap in stimuli. As gamers we are now living by the same laws of physics in the same cities and doing many of the same things we once did in real life, only virtually. Consider this \u2014 my real life car has about 25,000 miles on it. In all my driving games, I've driven a total of 31,459 miles. To some degree I've learned how to drive from the game. The sensory cues are very similar. It's a funny feeling when you have spent more time doing something on the TV than you have in real life. When I am driving down a road at sunset all I can think is, this is almost as beautiful as my games are.For my virtual worlds are perfect. More beautiful and rich than the real world around us. I'm not sure what the implications of my experience are, but the potential for using realistic video game stimuli in repetition on a vast number of loyal participants is frightening to me. Today I believe Big Brother would find much more success brainwashing the masses with video games rather than just simply TVs. Video games are fun, engaging, and leave your brain completely vulnerable to re-programming. But maybe brainwashing isn't always bad.Imagine a game that teaches us to respect each other, or helps us to understand the problems we're all facing in the real world. There is a potential to do good as well. It is critical, as these virtual worlds continue to mirror the real world we live in, that game developers realize that they have tremendous responsibilities before them. I'm not sure what the future of video games holds for our civilization. But as virtual and real world experiences increasingly overlap there is a greater and greater potential for other people to feel the same way I do.What I have only recently come to realize is that beyond the graphics, sound, game play and emotion it is the power to break down reality that is so fascinating and addictive to me. I know that I am losing my grip. Part of me is just waiting to let go. I know though, that no matter how amazing video games may become, or how flat the real world may seem to us, that we must stay aware of what our games are teaching us and how they leave us feeling when we finally do unplug.(Applause)DP: Wow.(Applause)I found that video very, very thought provoking, and that's why I wanted to bring it here for you guys to see. And what was interesting about it is the obvious choice for me to talk about was graphics and audio. But as you heard, Michael talked about all these other elements as well. Video games give an awful lot of other things too, and that's why people get so addicted. The most important one being fun.The name of this track is \"The Magic To Come.\" Who is that going to come from? Is it going to come from the best directors in the world as we thought it probably would? I don't think so. I think it's going to come from the children who are growing up now that aren't stuck with all of the stuff that we remember from the past. They're going to do it their way, using the tools that we've created. The same with students or highly creative people, writers and people like that.As far as colleges go, there's about 350 colleges around the world teaching video game courses. That means there's literally thousands of new ideas. Some of the ideas are really dreadful and some of them are great. There's nothing worse than having to listen to someone try and pitch you a really bad video game idea.(Laughter)Chris Anderson: You're off, you're off. That's it. He's out of time.DP: I've just got a little tiny bit more if you'll indulge me.CA: Go ahead. I'm going to stay right here though.(Laughter)DP: This is just a cool shot, because this is students coming to school after class. The school is closed; they're coming back at midnight because they want to pitch their video game ideas. I'm sitting at the front of the class, and they're actually pitching their ideas. So it's hard to get students to come back to class, but it is possible.This is my daughter, her name's Emma, she's 17 months old. And I've been asking myself, what is Emma going to experience in the video game world? And as I've shown here, we have the audience. She's never going to know a world where you can't press a button and have millions of people ready to play. You know, we have the technology. She's never going to know a world where the graphics just aren't stunning and really immersive. And as the student video showed, we can impact and move. She's never going to know a world where video games aren't incredibly emotional and will probably make her cry. I just hope she likes video games.(Laughter)So, my closing thought. Games on the surface seem simple entertainment, but for those that like to look a little deeper, the new paradigm of video games could open entirely new frontiers to creative minds that like to think big. Where better to challenge those minds than here at TED?Thank you.Chris Anderson: David Perry. That was awesome.", "id": 361, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:11.958 --> 00:00:13.958\nI grew up in Northern Ireland, right up in the\n\n00:00:13.958 --> 00:00:15.958\nvery, very north end of it there,\n\n00:00:15.958 --> 00:00:17.958\nwhere it's absolutely freezing cold.\n\n00:00:18.958 --> 00:00:21.958\nThis was me running around in the back garden mid-summer.\n\n00:00:21.958 --> 00:00:22.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:00:22.958 --> 00:00:23.958\nI couldn't pick a career.\n\n00:00:23.958 --> 00:00:25.958\nIn Ireland the obvious choice is the military,\n\n00:00:25.958 --> 00:00:29.958\nbut to be honest it actually kind of sucks.\n\n00:00:29.958 --> 00:00:30.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:00:30.958 --> 00:00:33.958\nMy mother wanted me to be a dentist.\n\n00:00:33.958 --> 00:00:35.958\nBut the problem was that people kept blowing everything up.\n\n00:00:35.958 --> 00:00:37.958\nSo I actually went to school in Belfast,\n\n00:00:37.958 --> 00:00:39.958\nwhich was where all the action happened.\n\n00:00:39.958 --> 00:00:41.958\nAnd this was a pretty common sight.\n\n00:00:41.958 --> 00:00:43.958\nThe school I went to was pretty boring.\n\n00:00:43.958 --> 00:00:45.958\nThey forced us to learn things like Latin.\n\n00:00:46.958 --> 00:00:48.958\nThe school teachers weren't having much fun,\n\n00:00:48.958 --> 00:00:50.958\nthe sports were very dirty or very painful.\n\n00:00:50.958 --> 00:00:53.958\nSo I cleverly chose rowing, which I got very good at.\n\n00:00:53.958 --> 00:00:55.958\nAnd I was actually rowing for my school here\n\n00:00:55.958 --> 00:00:58.958\nuntil this fateful day, and I flipped over right in front\n\n00:00:58.958 --> 00:00:59.958\nof the entire school.\n\n00:00:59.958 --> 00:01:01.958\nAnd that was the finishing post right there.\n\n00:01:01.958 --> 00:01:02.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:01:02.958 --> 00:01:03.958\nSo this was extremely embarrassing.\n\n00:01:03.958 --> 00:01:06.958\nBut our school at that time got a grant from the government,\n\n00:01:06.958 --> 00:01:08.958\nand they got an incredible computer -- the research machine 3DZ --\n\n00:01:08.958 --> 00:01:11.958\nand they left the programming manuals lying around.\n\n00:01:12.958 --> 00:01:14.958\nAnd so students like myself with nothing to do,\n\n00:01:14.958 --> 00:01:16.958\nwe would learn how to program it.\n\n00:01:16.958 --> 00:01:18.958\nAlso around this time, at home,\n\n00:01:18.958 --> 00:01:19.958\nthis was the computer that people were buying.\n\n00:01:19.958 --> 00:01:22.958\nIt was called the Sinclair ZX80. This was a 1K computer,\n\n00:01:22.958 --> 00:01:25.958\nand you'd buy your programs on cassette tape.\n\n00:01:25.958 --> 00:01:27.958\nActually I'm just going to pause for one second,\n\n00:01:27.958 --> 00:01:29.958\nbecause I heard that there's a prerequisite to speak here at TED --\n\n00:01:29.958 --> 00:01:32.958\nyou had to have a picture of yourself from the old days with big hair.\n\n00:01:32.958 --> 00:01:34.958\nSo I brought a picture with big hair.\n\n00:01:34.958 --> 00:01:35.958\n(Laughter).\n\n00:01:35.958 --> 00:01:37.958\nI just want to get that out of the way.\n\n00:01:37.958 --> 00:01:41.958\nSo after the Sinclair ZX80 came along the very cleverly named\n\n00:01:41.958 --> 00:01:43.958\nSinclair ZX81.\n\n00:01:43.958 --> 00:01:44.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:01:44.958 --> 00:01:45.958\nAnd -- you see the picture at the bottom?\n\n00:01:45.958 --> 00:01:47.958\nThere's a picture of a guy doing homework with his son.\n\n00:01:47.958 --> 00:01:50.958\nThat's what they thought they had built it for.\n\n00:01:50.958 --> 00:01:52.958\nThe reality is we got the programming manual\n\n00:01:52.958 --> 00:01:53.958\nand we started making games for it.\n\n00:01:53.958 --> 00:01:54.958\nWe were programming in BASIC,\n\n00:01:54.958 --> 00:01:56.958\nwhich is a pretty awful language for games,\n\n00:01:56.958 --> 00:01:58.958\nso we ended up learning Assembly language\n\n00:01:58.958 --> 00:02:01.958\nso we could really take control of the hardware.\n\n00:02:01.958 --> 00:02:03.958\nThis is the guy that invented it, Sir Clive Sinclair,\n\n00:02:03.958 --> 00:02:04.958\nand he's showing his machine.\n\n00:02:04.958 --> 00:02:06.958\nYou had this same thing in America,\n\n00:02:06.958 --> 00:02:08.958\nit was called the Timex Sinclair1000.\n\n00:02:09.958 --> 00:02:11.958\nTo play a game in those days you had to have an imagination\n\n00:02:11.958 --> 00:02:14.958\nto believe that you were really playing \"Battlestar Galactica.\"\n\n00:02:14.958 --> 00:02:17.958\nThe graphics were just horrible.\n\n00:02:17.958 --> 00:02:19.958\nYou had to have an even better imagination to play this game,\n\n00:02:19.958 --> 00:02:20.958\n\"Death Rider.\"\n\n00:02:20.958 --> 00:02:22.958\nBut of course the scientists couldn't help themselves.\n\n00:02:22.958 --> 00:02:25.958\nThey started making their own video games.\n\n00:02:25.958 --> 00:02:29.958\nThis is one of my favorite ones here, where they have rabbit breeding,\n\n00:02:29.958 --> 00:02:32.958\nso males choose the lucky rabbit.\n\n00:02:32.958 --> 00:02:34.958\nIt was around this time we went from 1K to 16K,\n\n00:02:34.958 --> 00:02:36.958\nwhich was quite the leap.\n\n00:02:36.958 --> 00:02:38.958\nAnd if you're wondering how much 16K is,\n\n00:02:38.958 --> 00:02:40.958\nthis eBay logo here is 16K.\n\n00:02:40.958 --> 00:02:43.958\nAnd in that amount of memory someone programmed\n\n00:02:43.958 --> 00:02:45.958\na full flight simulation program.\n\n00:02:45.958 --> 00:02:47.958\nAnd that's what it looked like.\n\n00:02:47.958 --> 00:02:50.958\nI spent ages flying this flight simulator,\n\n00:02:50.958 --> 00:02:53.958\nand I honestly believed I could fly airplanes by the end of it.\n\n00:02:53.958 --> 00:02:57.958\nHere's Clive Sinclair now launching his color computer.\n\n00:02:57.958 --> 00:03:00.958\nHe's recognized as being the father of video games in Europe.\n\n00:03:00.958 --> 00:03:02.958\nHe's a multi-millionaire, and I think that's why he's\n\n00:03:02.958 --> 00:03:04.958\nsmiling in this photograph.\n\n00:03:04.958 --> 00:03:06.958\nSo I went on for the next 20 years or so\n\n00:03:06.958 --> 00:03:08.958\nmaking a lot of different games.\n\n00:03:08.958 --> 00:03:10.958\nSome of the highlights were things like \"The Terminator,\"\n\n00:03:10.958 --> 00:03:13.958\n\"Aladdin,\" the \"Teenage Mutant Hero Turtles.\"\n\n00:03:13.958 --> 00:03:14.958\nBecause I was from the United Kingdom,\n\n00:03:14.958 --> 00:03:18.958\nthey thought the word ninja was a little too mean for children,\n\n00:03:18.958 --> 00:03:20.958\nso they decided to call it hero instead.\n\n00:03:20.958 --> 00:03:22.958\nI personally preferred the Spanish version,\n\n00:03:22.958 --> 00:03:24.958\nwhich was \"Tortugas Ninja.\"\n\n00:03:24.958 --> 00:03:26.958\nThat was much better.\n\n00:03:26.958 --> 00:03:28.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:03:28.958 --> 00:03:32.958\nThen the last game I did was based on trying to get the video game industry\n\n00:03:32.958 --> 00:03:35.958\nand Hollywood to actually work together on something --\n\n00:03:35.958 --> 00:03:38.958\ninstead of licensing from each other, to actually work.\n\n00:03:38.958 --> 00:03:40.958\nNow, Chris did ask me to bring some statistics with me,\n\n00:03:40.958 --> 00:03:42.958\nso I've done that.\n\n00:03:42.958 --> 00:03:46.958\nThe video game industry in 2005 became a 29 billion dollar business.\n\n00:03:46.958 --> 00:03:47.958\nIt grows every year.\n\n00:03:47.958 --> 00:03:49.958\nLast year was the biggest year.\n\n00:03:49.958 --> 00:03:51.958\nBy 2008, we're going to kick the butt of the music industry.\n\n00:03:52.958 --> 00:03:55.958\nBy 2010, we're going to hit 42 billion.\n\n00:03:56.958 --> 00:03:58.958\n43 percent of gamers are female.\n\n00:03:58.958 --> 00:04:00.958\nSo there's a lot more female gamers than people are really aware.\n\n00:04:00.958 --> 00:04:02.958\nThe average age of gamers?\n\n00:04:02.958 --> 00:04:04.958\nWell, obviously it's for children, right?\n\n00:04:04.958 --> 00:04:05.958\nWell, no, actually it's 30 years old.\n\n00:04:05.958 --> 00:04:09.958\nAnd interestingly, the people who buy the most games are 37.\n\n00:04:09.958 --> 00:04:11.958\nSo 37 is our target audience.\n\n00:04:12.958 --> 00:04:13.958\nAll video games are violent.\n\n00:04:13.958 --> 00:04:16.958\nOf course the newspapers love to beat on this.\n\n00:04:16.958 --> 00:04:20.958\nBut 83 percent of games don't have any mature content whatsoever,\n\n00:04:20.958 --> 00:04:22.958\nso it's just not true.\n\n00:04:22.958 --> 00:04:24.958\nOnline gaming statistics.\n\n00:04:24.958 --> 00:04:27.958\nI brought some stuff on \"World of Warcraft.\" It's 5.5 million players.\n\n00:04:27.958 --> 00:04:30.958\nIt makes about 80 million bucks a month in subscriptions.\n\n00:04:30.958 --> 00:04:33.958\nIt costs 50 bucks just to install it on your computer,\n\n00:04:33.958 --> 00:04:37.958\nmaking the publisher about another 275 million.\n\n00:04:37.958 --> 00:04:39.958\nThe game costs about 80 million dollars to make,\n\n00:04:39.958 --> 00:04:41.958\nso basically it pays for itself in about a month.\n\n00:04:41.958 --> 00:04:44.958\nA player in a game called \"Project Entropia\"\n\n00:04:44.958 --> 00:04:48.958\nactually bought his own island for 26,500 dollars.\n\n00:04:48.958 --> 00:04:50.958\nYou have to remember that this is not a real island.\n\n00:04:50.958 --> 00:04:52.958\nHe didn't actually buy anything, just some data.\n\n00:04:52.958 --> 00:04:54.958\nBut he got great terms on it.\n\n00:04:54.958 --> 00:04:57.958\nThis purchase included mining and hunting rights,\n\n00:04:57.958 --> 00:04:59.958\nownership of all land on the island, and a castle\n\n00:04:59.958 --> 00:05:01.958\nwith no furniture included.\n\n00:05:01.958 --> 00:05:02.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:05:02.958 --> 00:05:06.958\nThis market is now estimated at over 800 million dollars annually.\n\n00:05:06.958 --> 00:05:08.958\nAnd what's interesting about it is the market was actually created\n\n00:05:08.958 --> 00:05:10.958\nby the gamers themselves.\n\n00:05:10.958 --> 00:05:12.958\nThey found clever ways to trade items\n\n00:05:12.958 --> 00:05:14.958\nand to sell their accounts to each other\n\n00:05:14.958 --> 00:05:16.958\nso that they could make money while they were playing their games.\n\n00:05:16.958 --> 00:05:18.958\nI dove onto eBay a couple of days ago\n\n00:05:18.958 --> 00:05:22.958\njust to see what was gong on, typed in World of Warcraft, got 6,000 items.\n\n00:05:22.958 --> 00:05:24.958\nI liked this one the best:\n\n00:05:24.958 --> 00:05:28.958\na level 60 Warlock with lots of epics for 174,000 dollars.\n\n00:05:28.958 --> 00:05:31.958\nIt's like that guy obviously had some pain while making it.\n\n00:05:33.958 --> 00:05:35.958\nSo as far as popularity of games,\n\n00:05:35.958 --> 00:05:37.958\nwhat do you think these people are doing here?\n\n00:05:37.958 --> 00:05:42.958\nIt turns out they're actually in Hollywood Bowl in Los Angeles\n\n00:05:42.958 --> 00:05:45.958\nlistening to the L.A. Philharmonic playing video game music.\n\n00:05:45.958 --> 00:05:46.958\nThat's what the show looks like.\n\n00:05:46.958 --> 00:05:48.958\nYou would expect it to be cheesy, but it's not.\n\n00:05:48.958 --> 00:05:50.958\nIt's very, very epic and a very beautiful concert.\n\n00:05:50.958 --> 00:05:52.958\nAnd the people that went there absolutely loved it.\n\n00:05:53.958 --> 00:05:54.958\nWhat do you think these people are doing?\n\n00:05:54.958 --> 00:05:56.958\nThey're actually bringing their computers so they can play games\n\n00:05:56.958 --> 00:05:58.958\nagainst each other.\n\n00:05:58.958 --> 00:06:00.958\nAnd this is happening in every city around the world.\n\n00:06:00.958 --> 00:06:02.958\nThis is happening in your local cities too,\n\n00:06:02.958 --> 00:06:03.958\nyou're probably just not aware of it.\n\n00:06:03.958 --> 00:06:06.958\nNow, Chris told me that you had a timeline video a few years ago\n\n00:06:06.958 --> 00:06:10.958\nhere just to show how video game graphics have been improving.\n\n00:06:10.958 --> 00:06:13.958\nI wanted to update that video and give you a new look at it.\n\n00:06:13.958 --> 00:06:15.958\nBut what I want you to do is to try to understand it.\n\n00:06:15.958 --> 00:06:17.958\nWe're on this curve, and the graphics are getting\n\n00:06:17.958 --> 00:06:19.958\nso ridiculously better.\n\n00:06:19.958 --> 00:06:22.958\nAnd I'm going to show you up to maybe 2007.\n\n00:06:22.958 --> 00:06:24.958\nBut I want you to try and think about what games could look like\n\n00:06:24.958 --> 00:06:26.958\n10 years from now.\n\n00:06:26.958 --> 00:06:28.958\nSo we're going to start that video.\n\n00:06:29.958 --> 00:06:32.958\nVideo: Throughout human history people have played games.\n\n00:06:32.958 --> 00:06:35.958\nAs man's intellect and technology have evolved\n\n00:06:35.958 --> 00:06:38.958\nso too have the games he plays.\n\n00:06:38.958 --> 00:08:58.958\n(Music)\n\n00:08:58.958 --> 00:09:01.958\n(Applause)\n\n00:09:01.958 --> 00:09:03.958\nDavid Perry: The thing again I want you to think about is,\n\n00:09:03.958 --> 00:09:05.958\ndon't look at these graphics and think of that's the way it is.\n\n00:09:05.958 --> 00:09:07.958\nThink about that's where we are right now,\n\n00:09:07.958 --> 00:09:09.958\nand the curve that we're on means that this is going to continue\n\n00:09:09.958 --> 00:09:11.958\nto get better.\n\n00:09:11.958 --> 00:09:13.958\nThis is an example of the kind of graphics you need to be able to draw\n\n00:09:13.958 --> 00:09:16.958\nif you wanted to get a job in the video game industry today.\n\n00:09:16.958 --> 00:09:18.958\nYou need to be really an incredible artist.\n\n00:09:18.958 --> 00:09:20.958\nAnd once we get enough of those guys, we're going to want\n\n00:09:20.958 --> 00:09:21.958\nmore fantasy artists that can create places\n\n00:09:21.958 --> 00:09:24.958\nwe've never been to before, or characters that\n\n00:09:24.958 --> 00:09:25.958\nwe've just never seen before.\n\n00:09:26.958 --> 00:09:29.958\nSo the obvious thing for me to talk about today is graphics and audio.\n\n00:09:29.958 --> 00:09:31.958\nBut if you were to go to a game developers conference,\n\n00:09:31.958 --> 00:09:33.958\nwhat they're all talking about is emotion, purpose,\n\n00:09:33.958 --> 00:09:35.958\nmeaning, understanding and feeling.\n\n00:09:35.958 --> 00:09:38.958\nYou'll hear about talks like, can a video game make you cry?\n\n00:09:38.958 --> 00:09:41.958\nAnd these are the kind of topics we really actually care about.\n\n00:09:41.958 --> 00:09:44.958\nI came across a student who's absolutely excellent\n\n00:09:44.958 --> 00:09:47.958\nat expressing himself, and this student agreed\n\n00:09:47.958 --> 00:09:51.958\nthat he would not show his video to anybody until\n\n00:09:51.958 --> 00:09:52.958\nyou here at TED had seen it.\n\n00:09:52.958 --> 00:09:54.958\nSo I'd like to play this video.\n\n00:09:54.958 --> 00:09:58.958\nSo this is a student's opinion on what his experience of games are.\n\n00:09:58.958 --> 00:10:01.958\nVideo: I, like many of you, live somewhere between\n\n00:10:01.958 --> 00:10:03.958\nreality and video games.\n\n00:10:03.958 --> 00:10:07.958\nSome part of me -- a true living, breathing person --\n\n00:10:07.958 --> 00:10:11.958\nhas become programmed, electronic and virtual.\n\n00:10:11.958 --> 00:10:13.958\nThe boundary of my brain that divides real from fantasy\n\n00:10:13.958 --> 00:10:15.958\nhas finally begun to crumble.\n\n00:10:16.958 --> 00:10:19.958\nI'm a video game addict and this is my story.\n\n00:10:19.958 --> 00:10:35.958\n(Music)\n\n00:10:35.958 --> 00:10:36.958\nIn the year of my birth\n\n00:10:36.958 --> 00:10:40.958\nthe Nintendo Entertainment System also went into development.\n\n00:10:45.958 --> 00:10:47.958\nI played in the backyard, learned to read,\n\n00:10:47.958 --> 00:10:49.958\nand even ate some of my vegetables.\n\n00:10:49.958 --> 00:10:53.958\nMost of my childhood was spent playing with Legos.\n\n00:10:54.958 --> 00:10:56.958\nBut as was the case for most of my generation,\n\n00:10:56.958 --> 00:10:59.958\nI spent a lot of time in front of the TV.\n\n00:10:59.958 --> 00:11:02.958\nMr. Rogers, Walt Disney, Nick Junior,\n\n00:11:02.958 --> 00:11:05.958\nand roughly half a million commercials have undoubtedly\n\n00:11:05.958 --> 00:11:07.958\nleft their mark on me.\n\n00:11:08.958 --> 00:11:10.958\nWhen my parents bought my sister and I our first Nintendo,\n\n00:11:10.958 --> 00:11:14.958\nwhatever inherent addictive quality this early interactive\n\n00:11:14.958 --> 00:11:20.958\nelectronic entertainment possessed quickly took hold of me.\n\n00:11:25.958 --> 00:11:28.958\nAt some point something clicked.\n\n00:11:28.958 --> 00:11:34.958\n(Music)\n\n00:11:34.958 --> 00:11:36.958\nWith the combination of simple, interactive stories\n\n00:11:36.958 --> 00:11:40.958\nand the warmth of the TV set, my simple 16-bit Nintendo\n\n00:11:40.958 --> 00:11:42.958\nbecame more than just an escape.\n\n00:11:42.958 --> 00:11:46.958\nIt became an alternate existence, my virtual reality.\n\n00:11:46.958 --> 00:12:04.958\n(Music)\n\n00:12:04.958 --> 00:12:06.958\nI'm a video game addict, and it's not because of\n\n00:12:06.958 --> 00:12:07.958\na certain number of hours I have spent playing,\n\n00:12:07.958 --> 00:12:11.958\nor nights I have gone without sleep to finish the next level.\n\n00:12:11.958 --> 00:12:14.958\nIt is because I have had life-altering experiences in virtual space,\n\n00:12:14.958 --> 00:12:17.958\nand video games had begun to erode my own understanding\n\n00:12:17.958 --> 00:12:20.958\nof what is real and what is not.\n\n00:12:21.958 --> 00:12:24.958\nI'm addicted, because even though I know I'm losing my grip on reality,\n\n00:12:24.958 --> 00:12:27.958\nI still crave more.\n\n00:12:27.958 --> 00:12:37.958\n(Music)\n\n00:12:37.958 --> 00:12:40.958\nFrom an early age I learned to invest myself emotionally\n\n00:12:40.958 --> 00:12:43.958\nin what unfolded before me on screen.\n\n00:12:43.958 --> 00:12:47.958\nToday, after 20 years of watching TV geared to make me emotional,\n\n00:12:47.958 --> 00:12:51.958\neven a decent insurance commercial can bring tears to my eyes.\n\n00:12:55.958 --> 00:12:58.958\nI am just one of a new generation that is growing up.\n\n00:12:58.958 --> 00:13:01.958\nA generation who may experience much more meaning\n\n00:13:01.958 --> 00:13:04.958\nthrough video games than they will through the real world.\n\n00:13:05.958 --> 00:13:07.958\nVideo games are nearing an evolutionary leap,\n\n00:13:07.958 --> 00:13:10.958\na point where game worlds will look and feel just as real\n\n00:13:10.958 --> 00:13:13.958\nas the films we see in theatres, or the news we watch on TV.\n\n00:13:13.958 --> 00:13:15.958\nAnd while my sense of free will in these virtual worlds\n\n00:13:15.958 --> 00:13:19.958\nmay still be limited, what I do learn applies to my real life.\n\n00:13:20.958 --> 00:13:22.958\nPlay enough video games and eventually you will\n\n00:13:22.958 --> 00:13:25.958\nreally believe you can snowboard, fly a plane,\n\n00:13:25.958 --> 00:13:29.958\ndrive a nine-second quarter mile, or kill a man.\n\n00:13:29.958 --> 00:13:32.958\nI know I can.\n\n00:13:36.958 --> 00:13:39.958\nUnlike any pop culture phenomenon before it,\n\n00:13:39.958 --> 00:13:41.958\nvideo games actually allow us to become part of the machine.\n\n00:13:41.958 --> 00:13:44.958\nThey allow us to sublimate into the culture of interactive,\n\n00:13:44.958 --> 00:13:48.958\ndownloaded, streaming, HD reality.\n\n00:13:48.958 --> 00:13:50.958\nWe are interacting with our entertainment.\n\n00:13:51.958 --> 00:13:53.958\nI have come to expect this level of interaction.\n\n00:13:53.958 --> 00:13:56.958\nWithout it, the problems faced in the real world --\n\n00:13:56.958 --> 00:14:01.958\npoverty, war, disease and genocide -- lack the levity they should.\n\n00:14:02.958 --> 00:14:04.958\nTheir importance blends into the sensationalized drama\n\n00:14:04.958 --> 00:14:07.958\nof prime time TV.\n\n00:14:07.958 --> 00:14:10.958\nBut the beauty of video games today lies not in the lifelike graphics,\n\n00:14:10.958 --> 00:14:13.958\nthe vibrating joysticks or virtual surround sound.\n\n00:14:14.958 --> 00:14:17.958\nIt lies in that these games are beginning to make me emotional.\n\n00:14:18.958 --> 00:14:21.958\nI have fought in wars, feared for my own survival,\n\n00:14:21.958 --> 00:14:25.958\nwatched my cohorts die on beaches and woods that look and feel\n\n00:14:25.958 --> 00:14:28.958\nmore real than any textbook or any news story.\n\n00:14:29.958 --> 00:14:31.958\nThe people who create these games are smart.\n\n00:14:31.958 --> 00:14:35.958\nThey know what makes me scared, excited, panicked, proud or sad.\n\n00:14:35.958 --> 00:14:39.958\nThen they use these emotions to dimensionalize the worlds they create.\n\n00:14:39.958 --> 00:14:41.958\nA well-designed video game will seamlessly\n\n00:14:41.958 --> 00:14:44.958\nweave the user into the fabric of the virtual experience.\n\n00:14:44.958 --> 00:14:46.958\nAs one becomes more experienced\n\n00:14:46.958 --> 00:14:49.958\nthe awareness of physical control melts away.\n\n00:14:49.958 --> 00:14:51.958\nI know what I want and I do it.\n\n00:14:51.958 --> 00:14:56.958\nNo buttons to push, no triggers to pull, just me and the game.\n\n00:14:56.958 --> 00:15:00.958\nMy fate and the fate of the world around me lie inside my hands.\n\n00:15:04.958 --> 00:15:07.958\nI know violent video games make my mother worry.\n\n00:15:07.958 --> 00:15:09.958\nWhat troubles me is not that video game violence\n\n00:15:09.958 --> 00:15:12.958\nis becoming more and more like real life violence,\n\n00:15:12.958 --> 00:15:15.958\nbut that real life violence is starting to look more and more\n\n00:15:15.958 --> 00:15:17.958\nlike a video game.\n\n00:15:17.958 --> 00:15:24.958\n(Music)\n\n00:15:24.958 --> 00:15:27.958\nThese are all troubles outside of myself.\n\n00:15:27.958 --> 00:15:29.958\nI, however, have a problem very close to home.\n\n00:15:29.958 --> 00:15:32.958\nSomething has happened to my brain.\n\n00:15:32.958 --> 00:15:43.958\n(Music)\n\n00:15:43.958 --> 00:15:45.958\nPerhaps there is a single part of our brain that holds\n\n00:15:45.958 --> 00:15:47.958\nall of our gut instincts, the things we know to do\n\n00:15:47.958 --> 00:15:49.958\nbefore we even think.\n\n00:15:49.958 --> 00:15:52.958\nWhile some of these instincts may be innate, most are learned,\n\n00:15:52.958 --> 00:15:54.958\nand all of them are hardwired into our brains.\n\n00:15:55.958 --> 00:16:00.958\nThese instincts are essential for survival in both real and virtual worlds.\n\n00:16:05.958 --> 00:16:07.958\nOnly in recent years has the technology behind video games\n\n00:16:07.958 --> 00:16:11.958\nallowed for a true overlap in stimuli.\n\n00:16:11.958 --> 00:16:14.958\nAs gamers we are now living by the same laws of physics\n\n00:16:14.958 --> 00:16:16.958\nin the same cities and doing many of the same things\n\n00:16:16.958 --> 00:16:20.958\nwe once did in real life, only virtually.\n\n00:16:20.958 --> 00:16:22.958\nConsider this --\n\n00:16:22.958 --> 00:16:25.958\nmy real life car has about 25,000 miles on it.\n\n00:16:25.958 --> 00:16:30.958\nIn all my driving games, I've driven a total of 31,459 miles.\n\n00:16:30.958 --> 00:16:33.958\nTo some degree I've learned how to drive from the game.\n\n00:16:33.958 --> 00:16:35.958\nThe sensory cues are very similar.\n\n00:16:35.958 --> 00:16:37.958\nIt's a funny feeling when you have spent more time\n\n00:16:37.958 --> 00:16:40.958\ndoing something on the TV than you have in real life.\n\n00:16:41.958 --> 00:16:44.958\nWhen I am driving down a road at sunset all I can think is,\n\n00:16:44.958 --> 00:16:47.958\nthis is almost as beautiful as my games are.\n\n00:16:47.958 --> 00:16:49.958\nFor my virtual worlds are perfect.\n\n00:16:49.958 --> 00:16:52.958\nMore beautiful and rich than the real world around us.\n\n00:16:52.958 --> 00:16:55.958\nI'm not sure what the implications of my experience are,\n\n00:16:55.958 --> 00:16:59.958\nbut the potential for using realistic video game stimuli in repetition\n\n00:16:59.958 --> 00:17:03.958\non a vast number of loyal participants is frightening to me.\n\n00:17:03.958 --> 00:17:06.958\nToday I believe Big Brother would find much more success\n\n00:17:06.958 --> 00:17:08.958\nbrainwashing the masses with video games\n\n00:17:08.958 --> 00:17:11.958\nrather than just simply TVs.\n\n00:17:11.958 --> 00:17:14.958\nVideo games are fun, engaging, and leave your brain\n\n00:17:14.958 --> 00:17:17.958\ncompletely vulnerable to re-programming.\n\n00:17:18.958 --> 00:17:21.958\nBut maybe brainwashing isn't always bad.\n\n00:17:21.958 --> 00:17:23.958\nImagine a game that teaches us to respect each other,\n\n00:17:23.958 --> 00:17:26.958\nor helps us to understand the problems we're all facing\n\n00:17:26.958 --> 00:17:27.958\nin the real world.\n\n00:17:27.958 --> 00:17:29.958\nThere is a potential to do good as well.\n\n00:17:31.958 --> 00:17:33.958\nIt is critical, as these virtual worlds continue to mirror\n\n00:17:33.958 --> 00:17:36.958\nthe real world we live in, that game developers realize\n\n00:17:36.958 --> 00:17:38.958\nthat they have tremendous responsibilities before them.\n\n00:17:39.958 --> 00:17:42.958\nI'm not sure what the future of video games holds\n\n00:17:42.958 --> 00:17:43.958\nfor our civilization.\n\n00:17:43.958 --> 00:17:47.958\nBut as virtual and real world experiences increasingly overlap\n\n00:17:47.958 --> 00:17:49.958\nthere is a greater and greater potential for other people\n\n00:17:49.958 --> 00:17:52.958\nto feel the same way I do.\n\n00:17:53.958 --> 00:17:55.958\nWhat I have only recently come to realize\n\n00:17:55.958 --> 00:17:59.958\nis that beyond the graphics, sound, game play and emotion\n\n00:17:59.958 --> 00:18:02.958\nit is the power to break down reality that is so fascinating\n\n00:18:02.958 --> 00:18:04.958\nand addictive to me.\n\n00:18:04.958 --> 00:18:06.958\nI know that I am losing my grip.\n\n00:18:06.958 --> 00:18:10.958\nPart of me is just waiting to let go.\n\n00:18:13.958 --> 00:18:16.958\nI know though, that no matter how amazing video games may become,\n\n00:18:16.958 --> 00:18:19.958\nor how flat the real world may seem to us,\n\n00:18:19.958 --> 00:18:22.958\nthat we must stay aware of what our games are teaching us\n\n00:18:22.958 --> 00:18:27.958\nand how they leave us feeling when we finally do unplug.\n\n00:18:30.958 --> 00:18:31.958\n(Applause)\n\n00:18:31.958 --> 00:18:32.958\nDP: Wow.\n\n00:18:32.958 --> 00:18:39.958\n(Applause)\n\n00:18:39.958 --> 00:18:42.958\nI found that video very, very thought provoking,\n\n00:18:42.958 --> 00:18:44.958\nand that's why I wanted to bring it here for you guys to see.\n\n00:18:44.958 --> 00:18:46.958\nAnd what was interesting about it is the obvious choice\n\n00:18:46.958 --> 00:18:49.958\nfor me to talk about was graphics and audio.\n\n00:18:49.958 --> 00:18:52.958\nBut as you heard, Michael talked about all these other elements as well.\n\n00:18:53.958 --> 00:18:55.958\nVideo games give an awful lot of other things too,\n\n00:18:55.958 --> 00:18:56.958\nand that's why people get so addicted.\n\n00:18:56.958 --> 00:18:58.958\nThe most important one being fun.\n\n00:18:58.958 --> 00:19:00.958\nThe name of this track is \"The Magic To Come.\"\n\n00:19:00.958 --> 00:19:01.958\nWho is that going to come from?\n\n00:19:01.958 --> 00:19:03.958\nIs it going to come from the best directors in the world\n\n00:19:03.958 --> 00:19:04.958\nas we thought it probably would?\n\n00:19:04.958 --> 00:19:05.958\nI don't think so.\n\n00:19:05.958 --> 00:19:08.958\nI think it's going to come from the children who are growing up now\n\n00:19:08.958 --> 00:19:13.958\nthat aren't stuck with all of the stuff that we remember from the past.\n\n00:19:13.958 --> 00:19:15.958\nThey're going to do it their way, using the tools that we've created.\n\n00:19:15.958 --> 00:19:18.958\nThe same with students or highly creative people,\n\n00:19:18.958 --> 00:19:20.958\nwriters and people like that.\n\n00:19:21.958 --> 00:19:23.958\nAs far as colleges go, there's about 350 colleges around the world\n\n00:19:23.958 --> 00:19:26.958\nteaching video game courses.\n\n00:19:26.958 --> 00:19:29.958\nThat means there's literally thousands of new ideas.\n\n00:19:29.958 --> 00:19:32.958\nSome of the ideas are really dreadful and some of them are great.\n\n00:19:32.958 --> 00:19:34.958\nThere's nothing worse than having to listen to someone\n\n00:19:34.958 --> 00:19:36.958\ntry and pitch you a really bad video game idea.\n\n00:19:36.958 --> 00:19:42.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:19:42.958 --> 00:19:44.958\nChris Anderson: You're off, you're off. That's it.\n\n00:19:44.958 --> 00:19:47.958\nHe's out of time.\n\n00:19:47.958 --> 00:19:49.958\nDP: I've just got a little tiny bit more if you'll indulge me.\n\n00:19:49.958 --> 00:19:51.958\nCA: Go ahead. I'm going to stay right here though.\n\n00:19:51.958 --> 00:19:52.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:19:52.958 --> 00:19:55.958\nDP: This is just a cool shot, because this is students coming to school after class.\n\n00:19:55.958 --> 00:19:58.958\nThe school is closed; they're coming back at midnight\n\n00:19:58.958 --> 00:20:00.958\nbecause they want to pitch their video game ideas.\n\n00:20:00.958 --> 00:20:01.958\nI'm sitting at the front of the class,\n\n00:20:01.958 --> 00:20:03.958\nand they're actually pitching their ideas.\n\n00:20:03.958 --> 00:20:05.958\nSo it's hard to get students to come back to class,\n\n00:20:05.958 --> 00:20:06.958\nbut it is possible.\n\n00:20:06.958 --> 00:20:09.958\nThis is my daughter, her name's Emma, she's 17 months old.\n\n00:20:09.958 --> 00:20:12.958\nAnd I've been asking myself, what is Emma going to experience\n\n00:20:12.958 --> 00:20:14.958\nin the video game world?\n\n00:20:14.958 --> 00:20:17.958\nAnd as I've shown here, we have the audience.\n\n00:20:17.958 --> 00:20:20.958\nShe's never going to know a world where you can't press a button\n\n00:20:20.958 --> 00:20:22.958\nand have millions of people ready to play.\n\n00:20:22.958 --> 00:20:24.958\nYou know, we have the technology.\n\n00:20:24.958 --> 00:20:26.958\nShe's never going to know a world where the graphics just aren't\n\n00:20:26.958 --> 00:20:28.958\nstunning and really immersive.\n\n00:20:28.958 --> 00:20:31.958\nAnd as the student video showed, we can impact and move.\n\n00:20:31.958 --> 00:20:33.958\nShe's never going to know a world where video games\n\n00:20:33.958 --> 00:20:36.958\naren't incredibly emotional and will probably make her cry.\n\n00:20:36.958 --> 00:20:38.958\nI just hope she likes video games.\n\n00:20:38.958 --> 00:20:39.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:20:39.958 --> 00:20:40.958\nSo, my closing thought.\n\n00:20:40.958 --> 00:20:42.958\nGames on the surface seem simple entertainment,\n\n00:20:42.958 --> 00:20:44.958\nbut for those that like to look a little deeper,\n\n00:20:44.958 --> 00:20:47.958\nthe new paradigm of video games could open entirely new frontiers\n\n00:20:47.958 --> 00:20:49.958\nto creative minds that like to think big.\n\n00:20:50.958 --> 00:20:52.958\nWhere better to challenge those minds than here at TED?\n\n00:20:52.958 --> 00:20:53.958\nThank you.\n\n00:20:53.958 --> 00:20:55.958\nChris Anderson: David Perry.

Waking up with Abraham Lincoln in the morning, thinking of Franklin Roosevelt when I went to bed at night. But when I try and think about what I've learned about the meaning in life, my mind keeps wandering back to a seminar that I took when I was a graduate student at Harvard with the great psychologist Erik Erikson.He taught us that the richest and fullest lives attempt to achieve an inner balance between three realms: work, love and play. And that to pursue one realm to the disregard of the other, is to open oneself to ultimate sadness in older age. Whereas to pursue all three with equal dedication, is to make possible a life filled not only with achievement, but with serenity.So since I tell stories, let me look back on the lives of two of the presidents I've studied to illustrate this point \u2014 Abraham Lincoln and Lyndon Johnson. As for that first sphere of work, I think what Abraham Lincoln's life suggests is that fierce ambition is a good thing. He had a huge ambition. But it wasn't simply for office or power or celebrity or fame \u2014 what it was for was to accomplish something worthy enough in life so that he could make the world a little better place for his having lived in it.Even as a child, it seemed, Lincoln dreamed heroic dreams. He somehow had to escape that hard-scrabble farm from which he was born. No schooling was possible for him, except a few weeks here, a few weeks there. But he read books in every spare moment he could find. It was said when he got a copy of the King James Bible or \"Aesop's Fables,\" he was so excited he couldn't sleep. He couldn't eat. The great poet Emily Dickinson once said, \"There is no frigate like a book to take us lands away.\" How true for Lincoln.Though he never would travel to Europe, he went with Shakespeare's kings to merry England, he went with Lord Byron's poetry to Spain and Portugal. Literature allowed him to transcend his surroundings. But there were so many losses in his early life that he was haunted by death. His mother died when he was only nine years old; his only sister, Sarah, in childbirth a few years later; and his first love, Ann Rutledge, at the age of 22. Moreover, when his mother lay dying, she did not hold out for him the hope that they would meet in an afterworld. She simply said to him, \"Abraham, I'm going away from you now, and I shall never return.\" As a result he became obsessed with the thought that when we die our life is swept away \u2014 dust to dust.But only as he grew older did he develop a certain consolation from an ancient Greek notion \u2014 but followed by other cultures as well \u2014 that if you could accomplish something worthy in your life, you could live on in the memory of others. Your honor and your reputation would outlive your earthly existence. And that worthy ambition became his lodestar. It carried him through the one significant depression that he suffered when he was in his early 30s.Three things had combined to lay him low. He had broken his engagement with Mary Todd, not certain he was ready to marry her, but knowing how devastating it was to her that he did that. His one intimate friend, Joshua Speed, was leaving Illinois to go back to Kentucky because Speed's father had died. And his political career in the state legislature was on a downward slide. He was so depressed that friends worried he was suicidal. They took all knives and razors and scissors from his room. And his great friend Speed went to his side and said, \"Lincoln, you must rally or you will die.\" He said that, \"I would just as soon die right now, but I've not yet done anything to make any human being remember that I have lived.\"So fueled by that ambition, he returned to the state legislature. He eventually won a seat in Congress. He then ran twice for the Senate, lost twice. \"Everyone is broken by life,\" Ernest Hemingway once said, \"but some people are stronger in the broken places.\" So then he surprised the nation with an upset victory for the presidency over three far more experienced, far more educated, far more celebrated rivals. And then when he won the general election, he stunned the nation even more by appointing each of these three rivals into his Cabinet. It was an unprecedented act at the time because everybody thought, \"He'll look like a figurehead compared to these people.\" They said, \"Why are you doing this, Lincoln?\" He said, \"Look, these are the strongest and most able men in the country. The country is in peril. I need them by my side.\" But perhaps my old friend Lyndon Johnson might have put it in less noble fashion: \"Better to have your enemies inside the tent pissing out, than outside the tent pissing in.\" (Laughter)But it soon became clear that Abraham Lincoln would emerge as the undisputed captain of this unruly team. For each of them soon came to understand that he possessed an unparalleled array of emotional strengths and political skills that proved far more important than the thinness of his external r\u00e9sum\u00e9. For one thing, he possessed an uncanny ability to empathize with and to think about other peoples' point of view. He repaired injured feelings that might have escalated into permanent hostility. He shared credit with ease, assumed responsibility for the failure of his subordinates, constantly acknowledged his errors and learned from his mistakes. These are the qualities we should be looking for in our candidates in 2008. (Applause) He refused to be provoked by petty grievances. He never submitted to jealousy or brooded over perceived slights. And he expressed his unshakeable convictions in everyday language, in metaphors, in stories. And with a beauty of language \u2014 almost as if the Shakespeare and the poetry he had so loved as a child had worked their way into his very soul.In 1863, when the Emancipation Proclamation was signed, he brought his old friend, Joshua Speed, back to the White House, and remembered that conversation of decades before, when he was so sad. And he, pointing to the Proclamation, said, \"I believe, in this measure, my fondest hopes will be realized.\" But as he was about to put his signature on the Proclamation his own hand was numb and shaking because he had shaken a thousand hands that morning at a New Year's reception. So he put the pen down. He said, \"If ever my soul were in an act, it is in this act. But if I sign with a shaking hand, posterity will say, 'He hesitated.'\" So he waited until he could take up the pen and sign with a bold and clear hand. But even in his wildest dreams, Lincoln could never have imagined how far his reputation would reach.I was so thrilled to find an interview with the great Russian writer, Leo Tolstoy, in a New York newspaper in the early 1900s. And in it, Tolstoy told of a trip that he'd recently made to a very remote area of the Caucasus, where there were only wild barbarians, who had never left this part of Russia. Knowing that Tolstoy was in their midst, they asked him to tell stories of the great men of history. So he said, \"I told them about Napoleon and Alexander the Great and Frederick the Great and Julius Caesar, and they loved it. But before I finished, the chief of the barbarians stood up and said, 'But wait, you haven't told us about the greatest ruler of them all. We want to hear about that man who spoke with a voice of thunder, who laughed like the sunrise, who came from that place called America, which is so far from here, that if a young man should travel there, he would be an old man when he arrived. Tell us of that man. Tell us of Abraham Lincoln.'\" He was stunned. He told them everything he could about Lincoln. And then in the interview he said, \"What made Lincoln so great? Not as great a general as Napoleon, not as great a statesman as Frederick the Great.\" But his greatness consisted, and historians would roundly agree, in the integrity of his character and the moral fiber of his being.So in the end that powerful ambition that had carried Lincoln through his bleak childhood had been realized. That ambition that had allowed him to laboriously educate himself by himself, to go through that string of political failures and the darkest days of the war. His story would be told. So as for that second sphere, not of work, but of love \u2014 encompassing family, friends and colleagues \u2014 it, too, takes work and commitment. The Lyndon Johnson that I saw in the last years of his life, when I helped him on his memoirs, was a man who had spent so many years in the pursuit of work, power and individual success, that he had absolutely no psychic or emotional resources left to get him through the days once the presidency was gone.My relationship with him began on a rather curious level. I was selected as a White House Fellow when I was 24 years old. We had a big dance at the White House. President Johnson did dance with me that night. Not that peculiar \u2014 there were only three women out of the 16 White House Fellows. But he did whisper in my ear that he wanted me to work directly for him in the White House. But it was not to be that simple. For in the months leading up to my selection, like many young people, I'd been active in the anti-Vietnam War movement, and had written an article against Lyndon Johnson, which unfortunately came out in The New Republic two days after the dance in the White House. (Laugher) And the theme of the article was how to remove Lyndon Johnson from power. (Laughter) So I was certain he would kick me out of the program. But instead, surprisingly, he said, \"Oh, bring her down here for a year, and if I can't win her over, no one can.\" So I did end up working for him in the White House. Eventually accompanied him to his ranch to help him on those memoirs, never fully understanding why he'd chosen me to spend so many hours with.I like to believe it was because I was a good listener. He was a great storyteller. Fabulous, colorful, anecdotal stories. There was a problem with these stories, however, which I later discovered, which is that half of them weren't true. But they were great, nonetheless. (Laughter) So I think that part of his attraction for me was that I loved listening to his tall tales. But I also worried that part of it was that I was then a young woman. And he had somewhat of a minor league womanizing reputation. So I constantly chatted to him about boyfriends, even when I didn't have any at all.Everything was working perfectly, until one day he said he wanted to discuss our relationship. Sounded very ominous when he took me nearby to the lake, conveniently called Lake Lyndon Baines Johnson. And there was wine and cheese and a red-checked tablecloth \u2014 all the romantic trappings. And he started out, \"Doris, more than any other woman I have ever known ... \" And my heart sank. And then he said, \"You remind me of my mother.\" (Laughter)It was pretty embarrassing, given what was going on in my mind. But I must say, the older I've gotten, the more I realize what an incredible privilege it was to have spent so many hours with this aging lion of a man. A victor in a thousand contests, three great civil rights laws, Medicare, aid to education. And yet, roundly defeated in the end by the war in Vietnam. And because he was so sad and so vulnerable, he opened up to me in ways he never would have had I known him at the height of his power \u2014 sharing his fears, his sorrows and his worries. And I'd like to believe that the privilege fired within me the drive to understand the inner person behind the public figure, that I've tried to bring to each of my books since then.But it also brought home to me the lessons which Erik Erikson had tried to instill in all of us about the importance of finding balance in life. For on the surface, Lyndon Johnson should have had everything in the world to feel good about in those last years, in the sense that he had been elected to the presidency; he had all the money he needed to pursue any leisure activity he wanted; he owned a spacious ranch in the countryside, a penthouse in the city, sailboats, speedboats. He had servants to answer any whim, and he had a family who loved him deeply.And yet, years of concentration solely on work and individual success meant that in his retirement he could find no solace in family, in recreation, in sports or in hobbies. It was almost as if the hole in his heart was so large that even the love of a family, without work, could not fill it. As his spirits sagged, his body deteriorated until, I believe, he slowly brought about his own death. In those last years, he said he was so sad watching the American people look toward a new president and forgetting him. He spoke with immense sadness in his voice, saying maybe he should have spent more time with his children, and their children in turn. But it was too late. Despite all that power, all that wealth, he was alone when he finally died \u2014 his ultimate terror realized.So as for that third sphere of play, which he never had learned to enjoy, I've learned over the years that even this sphere requires a commitment of time and energy \u2014 enough so that a hobby, a sport, a love of music, or art, or literature, or any form of recreation, can provide true pleasure, relaxation and replenishment. So deep, for instance, was Abraham Lincoln's love of Shakespeare, that he made time to spend more than a hundred nights in the theater, even during those dark days of the war. He said, when the lights went down and a Shakespeare play came on, for a few precious hours he could imagine himself back in Prince Hal's time.But an even more important form of relaxation for him, that Lyndon Johnson never could enjoy, was a love of \u2014 somehow \u2014 humor, and feeling out what hilarious parts of life can produce as a sidelight to the sadness. He once said that he laughed so he did not cry, that a good story, for him, was better than a drop of whiskey. His storytelling powers had first been recognized when he was on the circuit in Illinois. The lawyers and the judges would travel from one county courthouse to the other, and when anyone was knowing Lincoln was in town, they would come from miles around to listen to him tell stories. He would stand with his back against a fire and entertain the crowd for hours with his winding tales. And all these stories became part of his memory bank, so he could call on them whenever he needed to. And they're not quite what you might expect from our marble monument.One of his favorite stories, for example, had to do with the Revolutionary War hero, Ethan Allen. And as Lincoln told the story, Mr. Allen went to Britain after the war. And the British people were still upset about losing the Revolution, so they decided to embarrass him a little bit by putting a huge picture of General Washington in the only outhouse, where he'd have to encounter it. They figured he'd be upset about the indignity of George Washington being in an outhouse. But he came out of the outhouse not upset at all. And so they said, \"Well, did you see George Washington in there?\" \"Oh, yes,\" he said, \"perfectly appropriate place for him.\" \"What do you mean?\" they said. \"Well,\" he said, \"there's nothing to make an Englishman shit faster than the sight of General George Washington.\" (Laughter) (Applause)So you can imagine, if you are in the middle of a tense cabinet meeting \u2014 and he had hundreds of these stories \u2014 you would have to relax. So between his nightly treks to the theater, his story telling, and his extraordinary sense of humor and his love of quoting Shakespeare and poetry, he found that form of play which carried him through his days. In my own life, I shall always be grateful for having found a form of play in my irrational love of baseball. Which allows me, from the beginning of spring training to the end of the fall, to have something to occupy my mind and heart other than my work.It all began when I was only six years old, and my father taught me that mysterious art of keeping score while listening to baseball games \u2014 so that when he went to work in New York during the day, I could record for him the history of that afternoon's Brooklyn Dodgers game. Now, when you're only six years old, and your father comes home every single night and listens to you \u2014 as I now realize that I, in excruciating detail, recounted every single play of every inning of the game that had just taken place that afternoon. But he made me feel I was telling him a fabulous story. It makes you think there's something magic about history to keep your father's attention.In fact, I'm convinced I learned the narrative art from those nightly sessions with my father. Because at first, I'd be so excited I would blurt out, \"The Dodgers won!\" or, \"The Dodgers lost!\" Which took much of the drama of this two-hour telling away. (Laughter) So I finally learned you had to tell a story from beginning to middle to end. I must say, so fervent was my love of the old Brooklyn Dodgers in those days that I had to confess in my first confession two sins that related to baseball.The first occurred because the Dodgers' catcher, Roy Campanella, came to my hometown of Rockville Centre, Long Island, just as I was in preparation for my first Holy Communion. And I was so excited \u2014 first person I'd ever see outside of Ebbets Field. But it so happened he was speaking in a Protestant Church. When you are brought up as a Catholic, you think that if you ever set foot in a Protestant Church, you'll be struck dead at the threshold. So I went to my father in tears, \"What are we going to do?\" He said, \"Don't worry. He's speaking in a parish hall. We're sitting in folding chairs. He's talking about sportsmanship. It's not a sin.\" But as I left that night, I was certain that somehow I'd traded the life of my everlasting soul for this one night with Roy Campanella. (Laughter) And there were no indulgences around that I could buy. So I had this sin on my soul when I went to my first confession. I told the priest right away. He said, \"No problem. It wasn't a religious service.\" But then, unfortunately, he said, \"And what else, my child?\"And then came my second sin. I tried to sandwich it in between talking too much in church, wishing harm to others, being mean to my sisters. And he said, \"To whom did you wish harm?\" And I had to say that I wished that various New York Yankees players would break arms, legs and ankles \u2014 (Laughter) \u2014 so that the Brooklyn Dodgers could win their first World Series. He said, \"How often do you make these horrible wishes?\" And I had to say, every night when I said my prayers. (Laughter) So he said, \"Look, I'll tell you something. I love the Brooklyn Dodgers, as you do, but I promise you some day they will win fairly and squarely. You do not need to wish harm on others to make it happen.\" \"Oh yes,\" I said. But luckily, my first confession \u2014 to a baseball-loving priest! (Laughter)Well, though my father died of a sudden heart attack when I was still in my 20s, before I had gotten married and had my three sons, I have passed his memory \u2014 as well as his love of baseball \u2014 on to my boys. Though when the Dodgers abandoned us to come to L.A., I lost faith in baseball until I moved to Boston and became an irrational Red Socks fan. And I must say, even now, when I sit with my sons with our season tickets, I can sometimes close my eyes against the sun and imagine myself, a young girl once more, in the presence of my father, watching the players of my youth on the grassy fields below: Jackie Robinson, Roy Campanella, Pee Wee Reese, and Duke Snider.I must say there is magic in these moments. When I open my eyes and I see my sons in the place where my father once sat, I feel an invisible loyalty and love linking my sons to the grandfather whose face they never had a chance to see, but whose heart and soul they have come to know through all the stories I have told. Which is why, in the end, I shall always be grateful for this curious love of history, allowing me to spend a lifetime looking back into the past. Allowing me to learn from these large figures about the struggle for meaning for life. Allowing me to believe that the private people we have loved and lost in our families, and the public figures we have respected in our history, just as Abraham Lincoln wanted to believe, really can live on, so long as we pledge to tell and to retell the stories of their lives. Thank you for letting me be that storyteller today. (Applause) Thank you.", "id": 363, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:11.958 --> 00:00:13.958\nSo, indeed, I have spent my life\n\n00:00:13.958 -->

achievement,\n\n00:00:54.958 --> 00:00:56.958\nbut with serenity.\n\n00:00:56.958 --> 00:00:58.958\nSo since I tell stories, let me look back\n\n00:00:58.958 --> 00:01:02.958\non the lives of two of the presidents I've studied to illustrate this point --\n\n00:01:02.958 --> 00:01:04.958\nAbraham Lincoln and Lyndon Johnson.\n\n00:01:05.958 --> 00:01:07.958\nAs for that first sphere of work,\n\n00:01:07.958 --> 00:01:10.958\nI think what Abraham Lincoln's life suggests\n\n00:01:10.958 --> 00:01:13.958\nis that fierce ambition is a good thing.\n\n00:01:13.958 --> 00:01:15.958\nHe had a huge ambition.\n\n00:01:15.958 --> 00:01:19.958\nBut it wasn't simply for office or power or celebrity or fame --\n\n00:01:19.958 --> 00:01:23.958\nwhat it was for was to accomplish something worthy enough in life\n\n00:01:23.958 --> 00:01:28.958\nso that he could make the world a little better place for his having lived in it.\n\n00:01:28.958 --> 00:01:32.958\nEven as a child, it seemed, Lincoln dreamed heroic dreams.\n\n00:01:32.958 --> 00:01:35.958\nHe somehow had to escape that hard-scrabble farm\n\n00:01:35.958 --> 00:01:36.958\nfrom which he was born.\n\n00:01:36.958 --> 00:01:38.958\nNo schooling was possible for him,\n\n00:01:38.958 --> 00:01:40.958\nexcept a few weeks here, a few weeks there.\n\n00:01:40.958 --> 00:01:43.958\nBut he read books in every spare moment he could find.\n\n00:01:43.958 --> 00:01:45.958\nIt was said when he got a copy of the King James Bible\n\n00:01:45.958 --> 00:01:48.958\nor \"Aesop's Fables,\" he was so excited he couldn't sleep.\n\n00:01:48.958 --> 00:01:49.958\nHe couldn't eat.\n\n00:01:49.958 --> 00:01:51.958\nThe great poet Emily Dickinson once said,\n\n00:01:51.958 --> 00:01:55.958\n\"There is no frigate like a book to take us lands away.\"\n\n00:01:55.958 --> 00:01:56.958\nHow true for Lincoln.\n\n00:01:56.958 --> 00:01:58.958\nThough he never would travel to Europe,\n\n00:01:58.958 --> 00:02:00.958\nhe went with Shakespeare's kings to merry England,\n\n00:02:00.958 --> 00:02:03.958\nhe went with Lord Byron's poetry to Spain and Portugal.\n\n00:02:03.958 --> 00:02:06.958\nLiterature allowed him to transcend his surroundings.\n\n00:02:07.958 --> 00:02:09.958\nBut there were so many losses in his early life\n\n00:02:09.958 --> 00:02:11.958\nthat he was haunted by death.\n\n00:02:11.958 --> 00:02:13.958\nHis mother died when he was only nine years old;\n\n00:02:13.958 --> 00:02:16.958\nhis only sister, Sarah, in childbirth a few years later;\n\n00:02:17.958 --> 00:02:20.958\nand his first love, Ann Rutledge, at the age of 22.\n\n00:02:20.958 --> 00:02:22.958\nMoreover, when his mother lay dying,\n\n00:02:22.958 --> 00:02:24.958\nshe did not hold out for him the hope\n\n00:02:24.958 --> 00:02:26.958\nthat they would meet in an afterworld.\n\n00:02:26.958 --> 00:02:27.958\nShe simply said to him,\n\n00:02:27.958 --> 00:02:31.958\n\"Abraham, I'm going away from you now, and I shall never return.\"\n\n00:02:31.958 --> 00:02:33.958\nAs a result he became obsessed with the thought\n\n00:02:33.958 --> 00:02:36.958\nthat when we die our life is swept away -- dust to dust.\n\n00:02:36.958 --> 00:02:39.958\nBut only as he grew older did he develop\n\n00:02:39.958 --> 00:02:41.958\na certain consolation from an ancient Greek notion --\n\n00:02:41.958 --> 00:02:43.958\nbut followed by other cultures as well --\n\n00:02:44.958 --> 00:02:46.958\nthat if you could accomplish something worthy in your life,\n\n00:02:46.958 --> 00:02:49.958\nyou could live on in the memory of others.\n\n00:02:49.958 --> 00:02:53.958\nYour honor and your reputation would outlive your earthly existence.\n\n00:02:54.958 --> 00:02:56.958\nAnd that worthy ambition became his lodestar.\n\n00:02:56.958 --> 00:03:00.958\nIt carried him through the one significant depression that he suffered\n\n00:03:00.958 --> 00:03:02.958\nwhen he was in his early 30s.\n\n00:03:02.958 --> 00:03:04.958\nThree things had combined to lay him low.\n\n00:03:04.958 --> 00:03:06.958\nHe had broken his engagement with Mary Todd,\n\n00:03:06.958 --> 00:03:08.958\nnot certain he was ready to marry her,\n\n00:03:08.958 --> 00:03:11.958\nbut knowing how devastating it was to her that he did that.\n\n00:03:11.958 --> 00:03:14.958\nHis one intimate friend, Joshua Speed, was leaving Illinois\n\n00:03:14.958 --> 00:03:17.958\nto go back to Kentucky because Speed's father had died.\n\n00:03:17.958 --> 00:03:19.958\nAnd his political career in the state legislature\n\n00:03:19.958 --> 00:03:21.958\nwas on a downward slide.\n\n00:03:21.958 --> 00:03:24.958\nHe was so depressed that friends worried he was suicidal.\n\n00:03:24.958 --> 00:03:27.958\nThey took all knives and razors and scissors from his room.\n\n00:03:27.958 --> 00:03:30.958\nAnd his great friend Speed went to his side and said,\n\n00:03:30.958 --> 00:03:32.958\n\"Lincoln, you must rally or you will die.\"\n\n00:03:32.958 --> 00:03:35.958\nHe said that, \"I would just as soon die right now,\n\n00:03:35.958 --> 00:03:38.958\nbut I've not yet done anything to make any human being\n\n00:03:38.958 --> 00:03:40.958\nremember that I have lived.\"\n\n00:03:40.958 --> 00:03:44.958\nSo fueled by that ambition, he returned to the state legislature.\n\n00:03:44.958 --> 00:03:46.958\nHe eventually won a seat in Congress.\n\n00:03:47.958 --> 00:03:50.958\nHe then ran twice for the Senate, lost twice.\n\n00:03:50.958 --> 00:03:52.958\n\"Everyone is broken by life,\" Ernest Hemingway once said,\n\n00:03:52.958 --> 00:03:55.958\n\"but some people are stronger in the broken places.\"\n\n00:03:55.958 --> 00:03:58.958\nSo then he surprised the nation with an upset victory\n\n00:03:58.958 --> 00:04:01.958\nfor the presidency over three far more experienced,\n\n00:04:01.958 --> 00:04:05.958\nfar more educated, far more celebrated rivals.\n\n00:04:05.958 --> 00:04:07.958\nAnd then when he won the general election,\n\n00:04:07.958 --> 00:04:09.958\nhe stunned the nation even more\n\n00:04:09.958 --> 00:04:12.958\nby appointing each of these three rivals into his Cabinet.\n\n00:04:12.958 --> 00:04:15.958\nIt was an unprecedented act at the time because everybody thought,\n\n00:04:15.958 --> 00:04:18.958\n\"He'll look like a figurehead compared to these people.\"\n\n00:04:18.958 --> 00:04:20.958\nThey said, \"Why are you doing this, Lincoln?\"\n\n00:04:20.958 --> 00:04:22.958\nHe said, \"Look, these are the strongest\n\n00:04:22.958 --> 00:04:24.958\nand most able men in the country.\n\n00:04:24.958 --> 00:04:27.958\nThe country is in peril. I need them by my side.\"\n\n00:04:27.958 --> 00:04:29.958\nBut perhaps my old friend Lyndon Johnson\n\n00:04:29.958 --> 00:04:31.958\nmight have put it in less noble fashion:\n\n00:04:31.958 --> 00:04:34.958\n\"Better to have your enemies inside the tent pissing out,\n\n00:04:34.958 --> 00:04:36.958\nthan outside the tent pissing in.\"\n\n00:04:36.958 --> 00:04:38.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:04:38.958 --> 00:04:41.958\nBut it soon became clear that Abraham Lincoln\n\n00:04:41.958 --> 00:04:45.958\nwould emerge as the undisputed captain of this unruly team.\n\n00:04:45.958 --> 00:04:48.958\nFor each of them soon came to understand\n\n00:04:48.958 --> 00:04:50.958\nthat he possessed an unparalleled array of\n\n00:04:50.958 --> 00:04:52.958\nemotional strengths and political skills\n\n00:04:52.958 --> 00:04:56.958\nthat proved far more important than the thinness of his external r\u00e9sum\u00e9.\n\n00:04:56.958 --> 00:04:58.958\nFor one thing, he possessed an uncanny ability\n\n00:04:58.958 --> 00:05:02.958\nto empathize with and to think about other peoples' point of view.\n\n00:05:02.958 --> 00:05:04.958\nHe repaired injured feelings that might have escalated\n\n00:05:04.958 --> 00:05:06.958\ninto permanent hostility.\n\n00:05:06.958 --> 00:05:08.958\nHe shared credit with ease,\n\n00:05:08.958 --> 00:05:11.958\nassumed responsibility for the failure of his subordinates,\n\n00:05:11.958 --> 00:05:14.958\nconstantly acknowledged his errors and learned from his mistakes.\n\n00:05:15.958 --> 00:05:18.958\nThese are the qualities we should be looking for in our candidates in 2008.\n\n00:05:18.958 --> 00:05:21.958\n(Applause)\n\n00:05:21.958 --> 00:05:25.958\nHe refused to be provoked by petty grievances.\n\n00:05:25.958 --> 00:05:28.958\nHe never submitted to jealousy or brooded over perceived slights.\n\n00:05:29.958 --> 00:05:31.958\nAnd he expressed his unshakeable convictions\n\n00:05:31.958 --> 00:05:35.958\nin everyday language, in metaphors, in stories.\n\n00:05:35.958 --> 00:05:37.958\nAnd with a beauty of language -- almost as if\n\n00:05:37.958 --> 00:05:39.958\nthe Shakespeare and the poetry he had so loved as a child\n\n00:05:39.958 --> 00:05:42.958\nhad worked their way into his very soul.\n\n00:05:43.958 --> 00:05:46.958\nIn 1863, when the Emancipation Proclamation was signed,\n\n00:05:46.958 --> 00:05:48.958\nhe brought his old friend, Joshua Speed, back to the White House,\n\n00:05:48.958 --> 00:05:52.958\nand remembered that conversation of decades before, when he was so sad.\n\n00:05:52.958 --> 00:05:54.958\nAnd he, pointing to the Proclamation, said,\n\n00:05:54.958 --> 00:05:59.958\n\"I believe, in this measure, my fondest hopes will be realized.\"\n\n00:05:59.958 --> 00:06:02.958\nBut as he was about to put his signature on the Proclamation\n\n00:06:02.958 --> 00:06:04.958\nhis own hand was numb and shaking\n\n00:06:04.958 --> 00:06:07.958\nbecause he had shaken a thousand hands that morning at a New Year's reception.\n\n00:06:07.958 --> 00:06:09.958\nSo he put the pen down.\n\n00:06:09.958 --> 00:06:12.958\nHe said, \"If ever my soul were in an act, it is in this act.\n\n00:06:12.958 --> 00:06:14.958\nBut if I sign with a shaking hand,\n\n00:06:14.958 --> 00:06:16.958\nposterity will say, 'He hesitated.'\"\n\n00:06:16.958 --> 00:06:18.958\nSo he waited until he could take up the pen\n\n00:06:18.958 --> 00:06:20.958\nand sign with a bold and clear hand.\n\n00:06:21.958 --> 00:06:23.958\nBut even in his wildest dreams,\n\n00:06:23.958 --> 00:06:24.958\nLincoln could never have imagined\n\n00:06:24.958 --> 00:06:26.958\nhow far his reputation would reach.\n\n00:06:26.958 --> 00:06:30.958\nI was so thrilled to find an interview with the great Russian writer,\n\n00:06:30.958 --> 00:06:34.958\nLeo Tolstoy, in a New York newspaper in the early 1900s.\n\n00:06:34.958 --> 00:06:37.958\nAnd in it, Tolstoy told of a trip that he'd recently made\n\n00:06:37.958 --> 00:06:39.958\nto a very remote area of the Caucasus,\n\n00:06:39.958 --> 00:06:41.958\nwhere there were only wild barbarians,\n\n00:06:41.958 --> 00:06:43.958\nwho had never left this part of Russia.\n\n00:06:43.958 --> 00:06:45.958\nKnowing that Tolstoy was in their midst,\n\n00:06:45.958 --> 00:06:48.958\nthey asked him to tell stories of the great men of history.\n\n00:06:48.958 --> 00:06:50.958\nSo he said, \"I told them about Napoleon\n\n00:06:50.958 --> 00:06:52.958\nand Alexander the Great and Frederick the Great\n\n00:06:52.958 --> 00:06:53.958\nand Julius Caesar, and they loved it.\n\n00:06:54.958 --> 00:06:57.958\nBut before I finished, the chief of the barbarians stood up and said,\n\n00:06:57.958 --> 00:07:00.958\n'But wait, you haven't told us about the greatest ruler of them all.\n\n00:07:00.958 --> 00:07:03.958\nWe want to hear about that man who spoke with a voice of thunder,\n\n00:07:04.958 --> 00:07:05.958\nwho laughed like the sunrise,\n\n00:07:06.958 --> 00:07:08.958\nwho came from that place called America, which is so far from here,\n\n00:07:08.958 --> 00:07:10.958\nthat if a young man should travel there,\n\n00:07:10.958 --> 00:07:12.958\nhe would be an old man when he arrived.\n\n00:07:12.958 --> 00:07:16.958\nTell us of that man. Tell us of Abraham Lincoln.'\"\n\n00:07:16.958 --> 00:07:17.958\nHe was stunned.\n\n00:07:17.958 --> 00:07:19.958\nHe told them everything he could about Lincoln.\n\n00:07:19.958 --> 00:07:21.958\nAnd then in the interview he said, \"What made Lincoln so great?\n\n00:07:21.958 --> 00:07:23.958\nNot as great a general as Napoleon,\n\n00:07:23.958 --> 00:07:26.958\nnot as great a statesman as Frederick the Great.\"\n\n00:07:26.958 --> 00:07:29.958\nBut his greatness consisted, and historians would roundly agree,\n\n00:07:29.958 --> 00:07:31.958\nin the integrity of his character\n\n00:07:31.958 --> 00:07:33.958\nand the moral fiber of his being.\n\n00:07:33.958 --> 00:07:35.958\nSo in the end that powerful ambition\n\n00:07:35.958 --> 00:07:38.958\nthat had carried Lincoln through his bleak childhood had been realized.\n\n00:07:38.958 --> 00:07:43.958\nThat ambition that had allowed him to laboriously educate himself by himself,\n\n00:07:43.958 --> 00:07:45.958\nto go through that string of political failures\n\n00:07:45.958 --> 00:07:47.958\nand the darkest days of the war.\n\n00:07:47.958 --> 00:07:49.958\nHis story would be told.\n\n00:07:50.958 --> 00:07:53.958\nSo as for that second sphere, not of work, but of love --\n\n00:07:53.958 --> 00:07:56.958\nencompassing family, friends and colleagues --\n\n00:07:56.958 --> 00:07:58.958\nit, too, takes work and commitment.\n\n00:07:59.958 --> 00:08:01.958\nThe Lyndon Johnson that I saw in the last years of his life,\n\n00:08:01.958 --> 00:08:03.958\nwhen I helped him on his memoirs,\n\n00:08:03.958 --> 00:08:06.958\nwas a man who had spent so many years in the pursuit of\n\n00:08:06.958 --> 00:08:08.958\nwork, power and individual success,\n\n00:08:08.958 --> 00:08:12.958\nthat he had absolutely no psychic or emotional resources left\n\n00:08:12.958 --> 00:08:13.958\nto get him through the days\n\n00:08:13.958 --> 00:08:15.958\nonce the presidency was gone.\n\n00:08:16.958 --> 00:08:19.958\nMy relationship with him began on a rather curious level.\n\n00:08:19.958 --> 00:08:22.958\nI was selected as a White House Fellow when I was 24 years old.\n\n00:08:22.958 --> 00:08:24.958\nWe had a big dance at the White House.\n\n00:08:24.958 --> 00:08:26.958\nPresident Johnson did dance with me that night.\n\n00:08:26.958 --> 00:08:27.958\nNot that peculiar --\n\n00:08:27.958 --> 00:08:29.958\nthere were only three women out of the 16 White House Fellows.\n\n00:08:29.958 --> 00:08:32.958\nBut he did whisper in my ear that he wanted me\n\n00:08:32.958 --> 00:08:34.958\nto work directly for him in the White House.\n\n00:08:34.958 --> 00:08:35.958\nBut it was not to be that simple.\n\n00:08:35.958 --> 00:08:37.958\nFor in the months leading up to my selection,\n\n00:08:37.958 --> 00:08:39.958\nlike many young people, I'd been active\n\n00:08:39.958 --> 00:08:41.958\nin the anti-Vietnam War movement,\n\n00:08:41.958 --> 00:08:44.958\nand had written an article against Lyndon Johnson,\n\n00:08:44.958 --> 00:08:45.958\nwhich unfortunately came out in The New Republic\n\n00:08:45.958 --> 00:08:47.958\ntwo days after the dance in the White House.\n\n00:08:47.958 --> 00:08:49.958\n(Laugher)\n\n00:08:49.958 --> 00:08:52.958\nAnd the theme of the article was how to remove Lyndon Johnson from power.\n\n00:08:52.958 --> 00:08:53.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:08:53.958 --> 00:08:56.958\nSo I was certain he would kick me out of the program.\n\n00:08:56.958 --> 00:08:57.958\nBut instead, surprisingly, he said,\n\n00:08:57.958 --> 00:08:59.958\n\"Oh, bring her down here for a year,\n\n00:08:59.958 --> 00:09:01.958\nand if I can't win her over, no one can.\"\n\n00:09:02.958 --> 00:09:04.958\nSo I did end up working for him in the White House.\n\n00:09:04.958 --> 00:09:06.958\nEventually accompanied him to his ranch to help him on those memoirs,\n\n00:09:06.958 --> 00:09:10.958\nnever fully understanding why he'd chosen me to spend so many hours with.\n\n00:09:10.958 --> 00:09:12.958\nI like to believe it was because I was a good listener.\n\n00:09:13.958 --> 00:09:14.958\nHe was a great storyteller.\n\n00:09:14.958 --> 00:09:16.958\nFabulous, colorful, anecdotal stories.\n\n00:09:16.958 --> 00:09:18.958\nThere was a problem with these stories, however,\n\n00:09:18.958 --> 00:09:21.958\nwhich I later discovered, which is that half of them weren't true.\n\n00:09:21.958 --> 00:09:22.958\nBut they were great, nonetheless.\n\n00:09:22.958 --> 00:09:23.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:09:23.958 --> 00:09:28.958\nSo I think that part of his attraction for me was that I loved listening to his tall tales.\n\n00:09:28.958 --> 00:09:31.958\nBut I also worried that part of it was that I was then a young woman.\n\n00:09:31.958 --> 00:09:34.958\nAnd he had somewhat of a minor league womanizing reputation.\n\n00:09:34.958 --> 00:09:36.958\nSo I constantly chatted to him about boyfriends,\n\n00:09:36.958 --> 00:09:38.958\neven when I didn't have any at all.\n\n00:09:38.958 --> 00:09:39.958\nEverything was working perfectly,\n\n00:09:39.958 --> 00:09:41.958\nuntil one day he said he wanted to discuss our relationship.\n\n00:09:41.958 --> 00:09:44.958\nSounded very ominous when he took me nearby to the lake,\n\n00:09:44.958 --> 00:09:47.958\nconveniently called Lake Lyndon Baines Johnson.\n\n00:09:47.958 --> 00:09:49.958\nAnd there was wine and cheese and a red-checked tablecloth --\n\n00:09:49.958 --> 00:09:51.958\nall the romantic trappings.\n\n00:09:51.958 --> 00:09:52.958\nAnd he started out,\n\n00:09:52.958 --> 00:09:54.958\n\"Doris, more than any other woman I have ever known ... \"\n\n00:09:54.958 --> 00:09:56.958\nAnd my heart sank.\n\n00:09:56.958 --> 00:09:57.958\nAnd then he said,\n\n00:09:57.958 --> 00:09:59.958\n\"You remind me of my mother.\"\n\n00:09:59.958 --> 00:10:00.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:10:00.958 --> 00:10:05.958\nIt was pretty embarrassing, given what was going on in my mind.\n\n00:10:06.958 --> 00:10:08.958\nBut I must say, the older I've gotten,\n\n00:10:08.958 --> 00:10:10.958\nthe more I realize what an incredible privilege it was\n\n00:10:10.958 --> 00:10:13.958\nto have spent so many hours with this aging lion of a man.\n\n00:10:13.958 --> 00:10:15.958\nA victor in a thousand contests,\n\n00:10:15.958 --> 00:10:20.958\nthree great civil rights laws, Medicare, aid to education.\n\n00:10:20.958 --> 00:10:22.958\nAnd yet, roundly defeated in the end by the war in Vietnam.\n\n00:10:23.958 --> 00:10:25.958\nAnd because he was so sad and so vulnerable,\n\n00:10:25.958 --> 00:10:27.958\nhe opened up to me in ways he never would have\n\n00:10:27.958 --> 00:10:29.958\nhad I known him at the height of his power --\n\n00:10:29.958 --> 00:10:32.958\nsharing his fears, his sorrows and his worries.\n\n00:10:32.958 --> 00:10:35.958\nAnd I'd like to believe that the privilege fired within me\n\n00:10:35.958 --> 00:10:38.958\nthe drive to understand the inner person behind the public figure,\n\n00:10:38.958 --> 00:10:42.958\nthat I've tried to bring to each of my books since then.\n\n00:10:42.958 --> 00:10:44.958\nBut it also brought home to me the lessons\n\n00:10:44.958 --> 00:10:47.958\nwhich Erik Erikson had tried to instill in all of us\n\n00:10:47.958 --> 00:10:50.958\nabout the importance of finding balance in life.\n\n00:10:50.958 --> 00:10:52.958\nFor on the surface, Lyndon Johnson should have had\n\n00:10:52.958 --> 00:10:56.958\neverything in the world to feel good about in those last years,\n\n00:10:56.958 --> 00:10:58.958\nin the sense that he had been elected to the presidency;\n\n00:10:58.958 --> 00:11:00.958\nhe had all the money he needed to pursue\n\n00:11:00.958 --> 00:11:02.958\nany leisure activity he wanted;\n\n00:11:02.958 --> 00:11:05.958\nhe owned a spacious ranch in the countryside, a penthouse in the city,\n\n00:11:05.958 --> 00:11:07.958\nsailboats, speedboats.\n\n00:11:07.958 --> 00:11:09.958\nHe had servants to answer any whim,\n\n00:11:09.958 --> 00:11:12.958\nand he had a family who loved him deeply.\n\n00:11:13.958 --> 00:11:16.958\nAnd yet, years of concentration solely on work and individual success\n\n00:11:16.958 --> 00:11:20.958\nmeant that in his retirement he could find no solace\n\n00:11:20.958 --> 00:11:24.958\nin family, in recreation, in sports or in hobbies.\n\n00:11:24.958 --> 00:11:27.958\nIt was almost as if the hole in his heart was so large\n\n00:11:27.958 --> 00:11:30.958\nthat even the love of a family, without work, could not fill it.\n\n00:11:30.958 --> 00:11:33.958\nAs his spirits sagged, his body deteriorated\n\n00:11:33.958 --> 00:11:36.958\nuntil, I believe, he slowly brought about his own death.\n\n00:11:37.958 --> 00:11:39.958\nIn those last years, he said he was so sad\n\n00:11:39.958 --> 00:11:43.958\nwatching the American people look toward a new president and forgetting him.\n\n00:11:43.958 --> 00:11:45.958\nHe spoke with immense sadness in his voice,\n\n00:11:45.958 --> 00:11:47.958\nsaying maybe he should have spent more time with his children,\n\n00:11:47.958 --> 00:11:49.958\nand their children in turn.\n\n00:11:49.958 --> 00:11:51.958\nBut it was too late.\n\n00:11:51.958 --> 00:11:53.958\nDespite all that power, all that wealth,\n\n00:11:53.958 --> 00:11:55.958\nhe was alone when he finally died --\n\n00:11:55.958 --> 00:11:57.958\nhis ultimate terror realized.\n\n00:11:58.958 --> 00:12:00.958\nSo as for that third sphere of play,\n\n00:12:00.958 --> 00:12:02.958\nwhich he never had learned to enjoy,\n\n00:12:02.958 --> 00:12:04.958\nI've learned over the years\n\n00:12:04.958 --> 00:12:07.958\nthat even this sphere requires a commitment of time and energy --\n\n00:12:07.958 --> 00:12:11.958\nenough so that a hobby, a sport, a love of music,\n\n00:12:11.958 --> 00:12:14.958\nor art, or literature, or any form of recreation,\n\n00:12:14.958 --> 00:12:17.958\ncan provide true pleasure, relaxation and replenishment.\n\n00:12:18.958 --> 00:12:21.958\nSo deep, for instance, was Abraham Lincoln's love of Shakespeare,\n\n00:12:21.958 --> 00:12:25.958\nthat he made time to spend more than a hundred nights in the theater,\n\n00:12:25.958 --> 00:12:27.958\neven during those dark days of the war.\n\n00:12:27.958 --> 00:12:30.958\nHe said, when the lights went down and a Shakespeare play came on,\n\n00:12:30.958 --> 00:12:33.958\nfor a few precious hours he could imagine himself\n\n00:12:33.958 --> 00:12:35.958\nback in Prince Hal's time.\n\n00:12:36.958 --> 00:12:38.958\nBut an even more important form of relaxation for him,\n\n00:12:38.958 --> 00:12:40.958\nthat Lyndon Johnson never could enjoy,\n\n00:12:40.958 --> 00:12:44.958\nwas a love of -- somehow -- humor,\n\n00:12:44.958 --> 00:12:47.958\nand feeling out what hilarious parts of life can produce\n\n00:12:47.958 --> 00:12:49.958\nas a sidelight to the sadness.\n\n00:12:49.958 --> 00:12:52.958\nHe once said that he laughed so he did not cry,\n\n00:12:53.958 --> 00:12:56.958\nthat a good story, for him, was better than a drop of whiskey.\n\n00:12:57.958 --> 00:12:59.958\nHis storytelling powers had first been recognized\n\n00:12:59.958 --> 00:13:00.958\nwhen he was on the circuit in Illinois.\n\n00:13:00.958 --> 00:13:02.958\nThe lawyers and the judges would travel\n\n00:13:02.958 --> 00:13:04.958\nfrom one county courthouse to the other,\n\n00:13:04.958 --> 00:13:07.958\nand when anyone was knowing Lincoln was in town,\n\n00:13:07.958 --> 00:13:09.958\nthey would come from miles around to listen to him tell stories.\n\n00:13:09.958 --> 00:13:11.958\nHe would stand with his back against a fire\n\n00:13:11.958 --> 00:13:15.958\nand entertain the crowd for hours with his winding tales.\n\n00:13:15.958 --> 00:13:17.958\nAnd all these stories became part of his memory bank,\n\n00:13:17.958 --> 00:13:20.958\nso he could call on them whenever he needed to.\n\n00:13:20.958 --> 00:13:22.958\nAnd they're not quite what you might expect from our marble monument.\n\n00:13:22.958 --> 00:13:24.958\nOne of his favorite stories, for example,\n\n00:13:24.958 --> 00:13:27.958\nhad to do with the Revolutionary War hero, Ethan Allen.\n\n00:13:27.958 --> 00:13:29.958\nAnd as Lincoln told the story,\n\n00:13:29.958 --> 00:13:31.958\nMr. Allen went to Britain after the war.\n\n00:13:31.958 --> 00:13:33.958\nAnd the British people were still upset\n\n00:13:33.958 --> 00:13:34.958\nabout losing the Revolution,\n\n00:13:34.958 --> 00:13:36.958\nso they decided to embarrass him a little bit\n\n00:13:36.958 --> 00:13:39.958\nby putting a huge picture of General Washington\n\n00:13:39.958 --> 00:13:41.958\nin the only outhouse, where he'd have to encounter it.\n\n00:13:41.958 --> 00:13:43.958\nThey figured he'd be upset about the indignity\n\n00:13:43.958 --> 00:13:45.958\nof George Washington being in an outhouse.\n\n00:13:45.958 --> 00:13:47.958\nBut he came out of the outhouse not upset at all.\n\n00:13:47.958 --> 00:13:50.958\nAnd so they said, \"Well, did you see George Washington in there?\"\n\n00:13:50.958 --> 00:13:53.958\n\"Oh, yes,\" he said, \"perfectly appropriate place for him.\"\n\n00:13:53.958 --> 00:13:55.958\n\"What do you mean?\" they said.\n\n00:13:55.958 --> 00:13:58.958\n\"Well,\" he said, \"there's nothing to make an Englishman shit\n\n00:13:58.958 --> 00:14:01.958\nfaster than the sight of General George Washington.\"\n\n00:14:01.958 --> 00:14:03.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:14:03.958 --> 00:14:04.958\n(Applause)\n\n00:14:05.958 --> 00:14:09.958\nSo you can imagine, if you are in the middle of a tense cabinet meeting --\n\n00:14:09.958 --> 00:14:11.958\nand he had hundreds of these stories --\n\n00:14:11.958 --> 00:14:13.958\nyou would have to relax.\n\n00:14:14.958 --> 00:14:16.958\nSo between his nightly treks to the theater,\n\n00:14:16.958 --> 00:14:20.958\nhis story telling, and his extraordinary sense of humor\n\n00:14:20.958 --> 00:14:22.958\nand his love of quoting Shakespeare and poetry,\n\n00:14:22.958 --> 00:14:25.958\nhe found that form of play which carried him through his days.\n\n00:14:26.958 --> 00:14:29.958\nIn my own life, I shall always be grateful\n\n00:14:29.958 --> 00:14:32.958\nfor having found a form of play in my irrational love of baseball.\n\n00:14:32.958 --> 00:14:35.958\nWhich allows me, from the beginning of spring training\n\n00:14:35.958 --> 00:14:36.958\nto the end of the fall,\n\n00:14:36.958 --> 00:14:38.958\nto have something to occupy my mind and heart\n\n00:14:38.958 --> 00:14:40.958\nother than my work.\n\n00:14:40.958 --> 00:14:42.958\nIt all began when I was only six years old,\n\n00:14:42.958 --> 00:14:44.958\nand my father taught me that mysterious art of keeping score\n\n00:14:44.958 --> 00:14:46.958\nwhile listening to baseball games --\n\n00:14:46.958 --> 00:14:49.958\nso that when he went to work in New York during the day,\n\n00:14:49.958 --> 00:14:51.958\nI could record for him the history of that afternoon's\n\n00:14:51.958 --> 00:14:53.958\nBrooklyn Dodgers game.\n\n00:14:53.958 --> 00:14:54.958\nNow, when you're only six years old,\n\n00:14:54.958 --> 00:14:55.958\nand your father comes home every single night\n\n00:14:55.958 --> 00:14:59.958\nand listens to you -- as I now realize that I, in excruciating detail,\n\n00:14:59.958 --> 00:15:00.958\nrecounted every single play of every inning\n\n00:15:00.958 --> 00:15:03.958\nof the game that had just taken place that afternoon.\n\n00:15:03.958 --> 00:15:06.958\nBut he made me feel I was telling him a fabulous story.\n\n00:15:06.958 --> 00:15:08.958\nIt makes you think there's something magic about history\n\n00:15:08.958 --> 00:15:10.958\nto keep your father's attention.\n\n00:15:10.958 --> 00:15:12.958\nIn fact, I'm convinced I learned the narrative art\n\n00:15:12.958 --> 00:15:14.958\nfrom those nightly sessions with my father.\n\n00:15:14.958 --> 00:15:16.958\nBecause at first, I'd be so excited I would blurt out,\n\n00:15:16.958 --> 00:15:18.958\n\"The Dodgers won!\" or, \"The Dodgers lost!\"\n\n00:15:18.958 --> 00:15:21.958\nWhich took much of the drama of this two-hour telling away.\n\n00:15:21.958 --> 00:15:22.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:15:22.958 --> 00:15:24.958\nSo I finally learned you had to tell a story\n\n00:15:24.958 --> 00:15:25.958\nfrom beginning to middle to end.\n\n00:15:26.958 --> 00:15:28.958\nI must say, so fervent was my love\n\n00:15:28.958 --> 00:15:30.958\nof the old Brooklyn Dodgers in those days\n\n00:15:30.958 --> 00:15:32.958\nthat I had to confess in my first confession\n\n00:15:32.958 --> 00:15:34.958\ntwo sins that related to baseball.\n\n00:15:34.958 --> 00:15:37.958\nThe first occurred because the Dodgers' catcher, Roy Campanella,\n\n00:15:37.958 --> 00:15:39.958\ncame to my hometown of Rockville Centre, Long Island,\n\n00:15:39.958 --> 00:15:42.958\njust as I was in preparation for my first Holy Communion.\n\n00:15:42.958 --> 00:15:44.958\nAnd I was so excited --\n\n00:15:44.958 --> 00:15:46.958\nfirst person I'd ever see outside of Ebbets Field.\n\n00:15:46.958 --> 00:15:49.958\nBut it so happened he was speaking in a Protestant Church.\n\n00:15:49.958 --> 00:15:50.958\nWhen you are brought up as a Catholic, you think\n\n00:15:50.958 --> 00:15:52.958\nthat if you ever set foot in a Protestant Church,\n\n00:15:52.958 --> 00:15:54.958\nyou'll be struck dead at the threshold.\n\n00:15:54.958 --> 00:15:56.958\nSo I went to my father in tears, \"What are we going to do?\"\n\n00:15:56.958 --> 00:15:58.958\nHe said, \"Don't worry. He's speaking in a parish hall.\n\n00:15:58.958 --> 00:16:00.958\nWe're sitting in folding chairs. He's talking about sportsmanship.\n\n00:16:00.958 --> 00:16:01.958\nIt's not a sin.\"\n\n00:16:01.958 --> 00:16:04.958\nBut as I left that night, I was certain that somehow\n\n00:16:04.958 --> 00:16:06.958\nI'd traded the life of my everlasting soul\n\n00:16:06.958 --> 00:16:08.958\nfor this one night with Roy Campanella.\n\n00:16:08.958 --> 00:16:09.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:16:09.958 --> 00:16:12.958\nAnd there were no indulgences around that I could buy.\n\n00:16:12.958 --> 00:16:15.958\nSo I had this sin on my soul when I went to my first confession.\n\n00:16:15.958 --> 00:16:16.958\nI told the priest right away.\n\n00:16:16.958 --> 00:16:18.958\nHe said, \"No problem. It wasn't a religious service.\"\n\n00:16:18.958 --> 00:16:21.958\nBut then, unfortunately, he said, \"And what else, my child?\"\n\n00:16:21.958 --> 00:16:23.958\nAnd then came my second sin.\n\n00:16:23.958 --> 00:16:25.958\nI tried to sandwich it in between talking too much in church,\n\n00:16:25.958 --> 00:16:28.958\nwishing harm to others, being mean to my sisters.\n\n00:16:28.958 --> 00:16:30.958\nAnd he said, \"To whom did you wish harm?\"\n\n00:16:30.958 --> 00:16:34.958\nAnd I had to say that I wished that various New York Yankees players\n\n00:16:34.958 --> 00:16:36.958\nwould break arms, legs and ankles --\n\n00:16:36.958 --> 00:16:37.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:16:37.958 --> 00:16:40.958\n-- so that the Brooklyn Dodgers could win their first World Series.\n\n00:16:40.958 --> 00:16:41.958\nHe said, \"How often do you make these horrible wishes?\"\n\n00:16:41.958 --> 00:16:44.958\nAnd I had to say, every night when I said my prayers.\n\n00:16:44.958 --> 00:16:45.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:16:45.958 --> 00:16:46.958\nSo he said, \"Look, I'll tell you something.\n\n00:16:46.958 --> 00:16:48.958\nI love the Brooklyn Dodgers, as you do,\n\n00:16:48.958 --> 00:16:51.958\nbut I promise you some day they will win fairly and squarely.\n\n00:16:51.958 --> 00:16:53.958\nYou do not need to wish harm on others to make it happen.\"\n\n00:16:53.958 --> 00:16:54.958\n\"Oh yes,\" I said.\n\n00:16:54.958 --> 00:16:57.958\nBut luckily, my first confession -- to a baseball-loving priest!\n\n00:16:57.958 --> 00:16:58.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:16:58.958 --> 00:17:01.958\nWell, though my father died of a sudden heart attack\n\n00:17:01.958 --> 00:17:02.958\nwhen I was still in my 20s,\n\n00:17:02.958 --> 00:17:06.958\nbefore I had gotten married and had my three sons,\n\n00:17:06.958 --> 00:17:10.958\nI have passed his memory -- as well as his love of baseball -- on to my boys.\n\n00:17:10.958 --> 00:17:12.958\nThough when the Dodgers abandoned us to come to L.A.,\n\n00:17:12.958 --> 00:17:16.958\nI lost faith in baseball until I moved to Boston\n\n00:17:16.958 --> 00:17:18.958\nand became an irrational Red Socks fan.\n\n00:17:19.958 --> 00:17:21.958\nAnd I must say, even now, when I sit with my sons\n\n00:17:21.958 --> 00:17:23.958\nwith our season tickets,\n\n00:17:23.958 --> 00:17:25.958\nI can sometimes close my eyes against the sun\n\n00:17:25.958 --> 00:17:29.958\nand imagine myself, a young girl once more, in the presence of my father,\n\n00:17:29.958 --> 00:17:32.958\nwatching the players of my youth on the grassy fields below:\n\n00:17:32.958 --> 00:17:36.958\nJackie Robinson, Roy Campanella, Pee Wee Reese, and Duke Snider.\n\n00:17:36.958 --> 00:17:38.958\nI must say there is magic in these moments.\n\n00:17:38.958 --> 00:17:40.958\nWhen I open my eyes and I see my sons\n\n00:17:40.958 --> 00:17:42.958\nin the place where my father once sat,\n\n00:17:43.958 --> 00:17:45.958\nI feel an invisible loyalty and love\n\n00:17:45.958 --> 00:17:49.958\nlinking my sons to the grandfather whose face they never had a chance to see,\n\n00:17:49.958 --> 00:17:51.958\nbut whose heart and soul they have come to know\n\n00:17:51.958 --> 00:17:54.958\nthrough all the stories I have told.\n\n00:17:54.958 --> 00:17:57.958\nWhich is why, in the end, I shall always be grateful for this curious love of history,\n\n00:17:57.958 --> 00:18:01.958\nallowing me to spend a lifetime looking back into the past.\n\n00:18:01.958 --> 00:18:04.958\nAllowing me to learn from these large figures\n\n00:18:04.958 --> 00:18:06.958\nabout the struggle for meaning for life.\n\n00:18:06.958 --> 00:18:08.958\nAllowing me to believe that the private people\n\n00:18:08.958 --> 00:18:10.958\nwe have loved and lost in our families,\n\n00:18:10.958 --> 00:18:13.958\nand the public figures we have respected in our history,\n\n00:18:13.958 --> 00:18:15.958\njust as Abraham Lincoln wanted to believe,\n\n00:18:15.958 --> 00:18:18.958\nreally can live on, so long as we pledge\n\n00:18:18.958 --> 00:18:22.958\nto tell and to retell the stories of their lives.\n\n00:18:22.958 --> 00:18:24.958\nThank you for letting me be that storyteller today.\n\n00:18:24.958 --> 00:18:25.958\n(Applause)\n\n00:18:25.958 --> 00:18:28.958\nThank you."}, {"title": "The Web as a city", "duration": "990", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/steven_johnson_on_the_web_as_a_city", "transcript": "I want to take you back basically to my hometown, and to a picture of my hometown of the week that \"Emergence\" came out. And it's a picture we've seen several times. Basically, \"Emergence\" was published on 9/11. I live right there in the West Village, so the plume was luckily blowing west, away from us. We had a two-and-a-half-day-old baby in the house that was ours \u2014 we hadn't taken it from somebody else.(Laughter)And one of the thoughts that I had dealing with these two separate emergences of a book and a baby, and having this event happen so close \u2014 that my first thought, when I was still kind of in the apartment looking out at it all or walking out on the street and looking out on it just in front of our building, was that I'd made a terrible miscalculation in the book that I'd just written. Because so much of that book was a celebration of the power and creative potential of density, of largely urban density, of connecting people and putting them together in one place, and putting them on sidewalks together and having them share ideas and share physical space together.And it seemed to me looking at that \u2014 that tower burning and then falling, those towers burning and falling \u2014 that in fact, one of the lessons here was that density kills. And that of all the technologies that were exploited to make that carnage come into being, probably the single group of technologies that cost the most lives were those that enable 50,000 people to live in two buildings 110 stories above the ground. If they hadn't been crowded \u2014 you compare the loss of life at the Pentagon to the Twin Towers, and you can see that very powerfully. And so I started to think, well, you know, density, density \u2014 I'm not sure if, you know, this was the right call.And I kind of ruminated on that for a couple of days. And then about two days later, the wind started to change a little bit, and you could sense that the air was not healthy. And so even though there were no cars still in the West Village where we lived, my wife sent me out to buy a, you know, a large air filter at the Bed Bath and Beyond, which was located about 20 blocks away, north. And so I went out. And obviously I'm physically a very strong person, as you can tell \u2014 (Laughter) \u2014 so I wasn't worried about carrying this thing 20 blocks. And I walked out, and this really miraculous thing happened to me as I was walking north to buy this air filter, which was that the streets were completely alive with people.There was an incredible \u2014 it was, you know, a beautiful day, as it was for about a week after, and the West Village had never seemed more lively. I walked up along Hudson Street \u2014 where Jane Jacobs had lived and written her great book that so influenced what I was writing in \"Emergence\" \u2014 past the White Horse Tavern, that great old bar where Dylan Thomas drank himself to death, and the Bleecker Street playground was filled with kids. And all the people who lived in the neighborhood, who owned restaurants and bars in the neighborhood, were all out there \u2014 had them all open. People were out. There were no cars, so it seemed even better, in some ways. And it was a beautiful urban day, and the incredible thing about it was that the city was working. The city was there. All the things that make a great city successful and all the things that make a great city stimulating \u2014 they were all on display there on those streets.And I thought, well, this is the power of a city. I mean, the power of the city \u2014 we talked about cities as being centralized in space, but what makes them so strong most of the time is they're decentralized in function. They don't have a center executive branch that you can take out and cause the whole thing to fail. If they did, it probably was right there at Ground Zero. I mean, you know, the emergency bunker was right there, was destroyed by the attacks, and obviously the damage done to the building and the lives. But nonetheless, just 20 blocks north, two days later, the city had never looked more alive. If you'd gone into the minds of the people, well, you would have seen a lot of trauma, and you would have seen a lot of heartache, and you would have seen a lot of things that would take a long time to recover.But the system itself of this city was thriving. So I took heart in seeing that. So I wanted to talk a little bit about the reasons why that works so well, and how some of those reasons kind of map on to where the Web is going right now. The question that I found myself asking to people when I was talking about the book afterwards is \u2014 when you've talked about emergent behavior, when you've talked about collective intelligence, the best way to get people to kind of wrap their heads around that is to ask, who builds a neighborhood? Who decides that Soho should have this personality and that the Latin Quarter should have this personality? Well, there are some kind of executive decisions, but mostly the answer is \u2014 everybody and nobody. Everybody contributes a little bit. No single person is really the ultimate actor behind the personality of a neighborhood.Same thing to the question of, who was keeping the streets alive post-9/11 in my neighborhood? Well, it was the whole city. The whole system kind of working on it, and everybody contributing a small little part. And this is increasingly what we're starting to see on the Web in a bunch of interesting ways \u2014 most of which weren't around, actually, except in very experimental things, when I was writing \"Emergence\" and when the book came out. So it's been a very optimistic time, I think, and I want to just talk about a few of those things. I think that there is effectively a new kind of model of interactivity that's starting to emerge online right now.And the old one looked like this. This is not the future King of England, although it looks like it. It's some guy, it's a GeoCities homepage of some guy that I found online who's interested, if you look at the bottom, in soccer and Jesus and Garth Brooks and Clint Beckham and \"my hometown\" \u2014 those are his links. But nothing really says this model of interactivity \u2014 which was so exciting and captures the real, the Web Zeitgeist of 1995 \u2014 than \"Click here for a picture of my dog.\" That is \u2014 you know, there's no sentence that kind of conjures up that period better than that, I think, which is that you suddenly have the power to put up a picture of your dog and link to it, and somebody reading the page has the power to click on that link or not click on that link.And, you know, I don't want to belittle that. That, in a sense \u2014 to reference what Jeff was talking about yesterday \u2014 that was, in a sense, the kind of interface electricity that powered a lot of the explosion of interest in the Web: that you could put up a link, and somebody could click on it, and it could take you anywhere you wanted to go. But it's still a very one-to-one kind of relationship. There's one person putting up the link, and there's another person on the other end trying to decide whether to click on it or not. The new model is much more like this, and we've already seen a couple of references to this. This is what happens when you search \"Steven Johnson\" on Google. About two months ago, I had the great breakthrough \u2014 one of my great, kind of shining achievements \u2014 which is that my website finally became a top result for \"Steven Johnson.\" There's some theoretical physicist at MIT named Steven Johnson who has dropped two spots, I'm happy to say.(Laughter)And, you know, I mean, I'll look at a couple of things like this, but Google is obviously the greatest technology ever invented for navel gazing. It's just that there are so many other people in your navel when you gaze. Because effectively, what's happening here, what's creating this page, obviously \u2014 and we all know this, but it's worth just thinking about it \u2014 is not some person deciding that I am the number one answer for Steven Johnson, but rather somehow the entire web of people putting up pages and deciding to link to my page or not link to it, and Google just sitting there and running the numbers. So there's this collective decision-making that's going on. This page is effectively, collectively authored by the Web, and Google is just helping us kind of to put the authorship in one kind of coherent place.Now, they're more innovative \u2014 well, Google's pretty innovative \u2014 but there are some new twists on this. There's this incredibly interesting new site \u2014 Technorati \u2014 that's filled with lots of little widgets that are expanding on these. And these are looking in the blog world and the world of weblogs. He's analyzed basically all the weblogs out there that he's tracking. And he's tracking how many other weblogs linked to those weblogs, and so you have kind of an authority \u2014 a weblog that has a lot of links to it is more authoritative than a weblog that has few links to it. And so at any given time, on any given page on the Web, actually, you can say, what does the weblog community think about this page? And you can get a list. This is what they think about my site; it's ranked by blog authority. You can also rank it by the latest posts.So when I was talking in \"Emergence,\" I talked about the limitations of the one-way linking architecture that, basically, you could link to somebody else but they wouldn't necessarily know that you were pointing to them. And that was one of the reasons why the web wasn't quite as emergent as it could be because you needed two-way linking, you needed that kind of feedback mechanism to be able to really do interesting things. Well, something like Technorati is supplying that. Now what's interesting here is that this is a quote from Dave Weinberger, where he talks about everything being purposive in the Web \u2014 there's nothing artificial. He has this line where he says, you know, you're going to put up a link there, if you see a link, somebody decided to put it there. And he says, the link to one site didn't just grow on the other page \"like a tree fungus.\"And in fact, I think that's not entirely true anymore. I could put up a feed of all those links generated by Technorati on the right-hand side of my page, and they would change as the overall ecology of the Web changes. That little list there would change. I wouldn't really be directly in control of it. So it's much closer, in a way, to a data fungus, in a sense, wrapped around that page, than it is to a deliberate link that I've placed there. Now, what you're having here is basically a global brain that you're able to do lots of kind of experiments on to see what it's thinking. And there are all these interesting tools. Google does the Google Zeitgeist, which looks at search requests to test what's going on, what people are interested in, and they publish it with lots of fun graphs. And I'm saying a lot of nice things about Google, so I'll be I'll be saying one little critical thing.There's a problem with the Google Zeitgeist, which is it often comes back with news that a lot of people are searching for Britney Spears pictures, which is not necessarily news. The Columbia blows up, suddenly there are a lot of searches on Columbia. Well, you know, we should expect to see that. That's not necessarily something we didn't know already. So the key thing in terms of these new tools that are kind of plumbing the depths of the global brain, that are sending kind of trace dyes through that whole bloodstream \u2014 the question is, are you finding out something new?And one of the things that I experimented with is this thing called Google Share which is basically, you take an abstract term, and you search Google for that term, and then you search the results that you get back for somebody's name. So basically, the number of pages that mention this term, that also mention this page, the percentage of those pages is that person's Google Share of that term. So you can do kind of interesting contests. Like for instance, this is a Google Share of the TED Conference. So Richard Saul Wurman has about a 15 percent Google Share of the TED conference. Our good friend Chris has about a six percent \u2014 but with a bullet, I might add.(Laughter)But the interesting thing is, you can broaden the search a little bit. And it turns out, actually, that 42 percent is the Mola mola fish. I had no idea. No, that's not true. (Laughter) I made that up because I just wanted to put up a slide of the Mola mola fish.(Laughter)I also did \u2014 and I don't want to start a little fight in the next panel \u2014 but I did a Google Share analysis of evolution and natural selection. So right here \u2014 now this is a big category, you have smaller percentages, so this is 0.7 percent \u2014 Dan Dennett, who'll be speaking shortly. Right below him, 0.5 percent, Steven Pinker. So Dennett's in the lead a little bit there. But what's interesting is you can then broaden the search and actually see interesting things and get a sense of what else is out there. So Gary Bauer is not too far behind \u2014 has slightly different theories about evolution and natural selection. And right behind him is L. Ron Hubbard. So \u2014 (Laughter) you can see we're in the ascot, which is always good. And by the way, Chris, that would've been a really good panel, I think, right there.(Laughter)Hubbard apparently started to reach, but besides that, I think it would be good next year. Another quick thing \u2014 this is a slightly different thing, but this analysis some of you may have seen. It just came out. This is bursty words, looking at the historical record of State of the Union Addresses. So these are words that suddenly start to appear out of nowhere, so they're kind of, you know, memes that start taking off, that didn't have a lot of historical precedent before. So the first one is \u2014 these are the bursty words around 1860s \u2014 slaves, emancipation, slavery, rebellion, Kansas. That's Britney Spears. I mean, you know, OK, interesting. They're talking about slavery in 1860. 1935 \u2014 relief, depression, recovery banks. And OK, I didn't learn anything new there as well \u2014 that's pretty obvious. 1985, right at the center of the Reagan years \u2014 that's, we're, there's, we've, it's.(Laughter)Now, there's one way to interpret this, which is to say that \"emancipation\" and \"depression\" and \"recovery\" all have a lot of syllables. So you know, you can actually download \u2014 it's hard to remember those. But seriously, actually, what you can see there, in a way that would be very hard to detect otherwise, is Reagan reinventing the political language of the country and shifting to a much more intimate, much more folksy, much more telegenic \u2014 contracting all those verbs. You know, 20 years before it was still, \"Ask not what you can do,\" but with Reagan, it's, \"that's where, there's Nancy and I,\" that kind of language. And so something we kind of knew, but you didn't actually notice syntactically what he was doing. I'll go very quickly. The question now \u2014 and this is the really interesting question \u2014 is, what kind of higher-level shape is emerging right now in the overall Web ecosystem \u2014 and particularly in the ecosystem of the blogs because they are really kind of at the cutting edge.And I think what happens there will also happen in the wider system. Now there was a very interesting article by Clay Shirky that got a lot of attention about a month ago, and this is basically the distribution of links on the web to all these various different blogs. It follows a power law, so that there are a few extremely well-linked to, popular blogs, and a long tail of blogs with very few links. So 20 percent of the blogs get 80 percent of the links. Now this is a very interesting thing. It's caused a lot of controversy because people thought that this was the ultimate kind of one man, one modem democracy, where anybody can get out there and get their voice heard.And so the question is, \"Why is this happening?\" It's not being imposed by fiat from above. It's an emergent property of the blogosphere right now. Now, what's great about it is that people are working on \u2014 within seconds of Clay publishing this piece, people started working on changing the underlying rules of the system so that a different shape would start appearing. And basically, the shape appears largely because of a kind of a first-mover advantage. if you're the first site there, everybody links to you. If you're the second site there, most people link to you. And so very quickly you can accumulate a bunch of links, and it makes it more likely for newcomers to link to you in the future, and then you get this kind of shape. And so what Dave Sifry at Technorati started working on, literally as Shirky started \u2014 after he published his piece \u2014 was something that basically just gave a new kind of priority to newcomers. And he started looking at interesting newcomers that don't have a lot of links, that suddenly get a bunch of links in the last 24 hours.So in a sense, bursty weblogs coming from new voices. So he's working on a tool right there that can actually change the overall system. And it creates a kind of planned emergence. You're not totally in control, but you're changing the underlying rules in interesting ways because you have an end result which is maybe a more democratic spread of voices. So the most amazing thing about this \u2014 and I'll end on this note \u2014 is, most emergent systems, most self-organizing systems are not made up of component parts that are capable of looking at the overall pattern and changing their behavior based on whether they like the pattern or not. So the most wonderful thing, I think, about this whole debate about power laws and software that could change it is the fact that we're having the conversation. I hope it continues here.

falling,\n\n00:01:32.958 --> 00:01:34.958\nthose towers burning and falling -- that in fact, one of the lessons\n\n00:01:34.958 --> 00:01:36.958\nhere was that density kills.\n\n00:01:36.958 --> 00:01:39.958\nAnd that of all the technologies that were exploited\n\n00:01:39.958 --> 00:01:43.958\nto make that carnage come into being,\n\n00:01:44.958 --> 00:01:50.958\nprobably the single group of technologies that cost the most lives\n\n00:01:50.958 --> 00:01:54.958\nwere those that enable 50,000 people to live in two buildings\n\n00:01:54.958 --> 00:01:56.958\n110 stories above the ground.\n\n00:01:56.958 --> 00:01:58.958\nIf they hadn't been crowded --\n\n00:01:58.958 --> 00:02:00.958\nyou compare the loss of life at the Pentagon to the Twin Towers,\n\n00:02:01.958 --> 00:02:03.958\nand you can see that very powerfully.\n\n00:02:03.958 --> 00:02:06.958\nAnd so I started to think, well, you know, density, density --\n\n00:02:06.958 --> 00:02:09.958\nI'm not sure if, you know, this was the right call.\n\n00:02:10.958 --> 00:02:13.958\nAnd I kind of ruminated on that for a couple of days.\n\n00:02:13.958 --> 00:02:17.958\nAnd then about two days later, the wind started to change a little bit,\n\n00:02:17.958 --> 00:02:20.958\nand you could sense that the air was not healthy.\n\n00:02:20.958 --> 00:02:24.958\nAnd so even though there were no cars still in the West Village\n\n00:02:24.958 --> 00:02:27.958\nwhere we lived, my wife sent me out to buy a, you know,\n\n00:02:27.958 --> 00:02:31.958\na large air filter at the Bed Bath and Beyond,\n\n00:02:31.958 --> 00:02:34.958\nwhich was located about 20 blocks away, north.\n\n00:02:34.958 --> 00:02:36.958\nAnd so I went out.\n\n00:02:36.958 --> 00:02:39.958\nAnd obviously I'm physically a very strong person, as you can tell -- (Laughter) --\n\n00:02:40.958 --> 00:02:43.958\nso I wasn't worried about carrying this thing 20 blocks.\n\n00:02:43.958 --> 00:02:47.958\nAnd I walked out, and this really miraculous thing happened to me\n\n00:02:47.958 --> 00:02:50.958\nas I was walking north to buy this air filter,\n\n00:02:50.958 --> 00:02:54.958\nwhich was that the streets were completely alive with people.\n\n00:02:55.958 --> 00:02:58.958\nThere was an incredible -- it was, you know, a beautiful day,\n\n00:02:58.958 --> 00:03:00.958\nas it was for about a week after,\n\n00:03:00.958 --> 00:03:03.958\nand the West Village had never seemed more lively.\n\n00:03:03.958 --> 00:03:05.958\nI walked up along Hudson Street --\n\n00:03:05.958 --> 00:03:07.958\nwhere Jane Jacobs had lived and written her great book\n\n00:03:07.958 --> 00:03:09.958\nthat so influenced what I was writing in \"Emergence\" --\n\n00:03:09.958 --> 00:03:11.958\npast the White Horse Tavern,\n\n00:03:11.958 --> 00:03:14.958\nthat great old bar where Dylan Thomas drank himself to death,\n\n00:03:14.958 --> 00:03:17.958\nand the Bleecker Street playground was filled with kids.\n\n00:03:17.958 --> 00:03:19.958\nAnd all the people who lived in the neighborhood,\n\n00:03:19.958 --> 00:03:21.958\nwho owned restaurants and bars in the neighborhood,\n\n00:03:21.958 --> 00:03:23.958\nwere all out there -- had them all open.\n\n00:03:23.958 --> 00:03:25.958\nPeople were out.\n\n00:03:25.958 --> 00:03:27.958\nThere were no cars, so it seemed even better, in some ways.\n\n00:03:27.958 --> 00:03:30.958\nAnd it was a beautiful urban day,\n\n00:03:30.958 --> 00:03:34.958\nand the incredible thing about it was that the city was working.\n\n00:03:34.958 --> 00:03:36.958\nThe city was there.\n\n00:03:36.958 --> 00:03:38.958\nAll the things that make a great city successful\n\n00:03:38.958 --> 00:03:40.958\nand all the things that make a great city stimulating --\n\n00:03:40.958 --> 00:03:42.958\nthey were all on display there on those streets.\n\n00:03:42.958 --> 00:03:46.958\nAnd I thought, well, this is the power of a city.\n\n00:03:46.958 --> 00:03:48.958\nI mean, the power of the city --\n\n00:03:48.958 --> 00:03:50.958\nwe talked about cities as being centralized in space,\n\n00:03:50.958 --> 00:03:52.958\nbut what makes them so strong most of the time\n\n00:03:52.958 --> 00:03:54.958\nis they're decentralized in function.\n\n00:03:54.958 --> 00:03:56.958\nThey don't have a center executive branch that you can take out\n\n00:03:56.958 --> 00:03:58.958\nand cause the whole thing to fail.\n\n00:03:58.958 --> 00:04:01.958\nIf they did, it probably was right there at Ground Zero.\n\n00:04:01.958 --> 00:04:03.958\nI mean, you know, the emergency bunker was right there,\n\n00:04:03.958 --> 00:04:05.958\nwas destroyed by the attacks,\n\n00:04:05.958 --> 00:04:07.958\nand obviously the damage done to the building and the lives.\n\n00:04:07.958 --> 00:04:11.958\nBut nonetheless, just 20 blocks north, two days later,\n\n00:04:11.958 --> 00:04:14.958\nthe city had never looked more alive.\n\n00:04:14.958 --> 00:04:16.958\nIf you'd gone into the minds of the people,\n\n00:04:16.958 --> 00:04:18.958\nwell, you would have seen a lot of trauma,\n\n00:04:18.958 --> 00:04:20.958\nand you would have seen a lot of heartache,\n\n00:04:20.958 --> 00:04:23.958\nand you would have seen a lot of things that would take a long time to recover.\n\n00:04:23.958 --> 00:04:25.958\nBut the system itself of this city was thriving.\n\n00:04:26.958 --> 00:04:29.958\nSo I took heart in seeing that.\n\n00:04:29.958 --> 00:04:35.958\nSo I wanted to talk a little bit about the reasons why that works so well,\n\n00:04:35.958 --> 00:04:37.958\nand how some of those reasons kind of map\n\n00:04:37.958 --> 00:04:39.958\non to where the Web is going right now.\n\n00:04:40.958 --> 00:04:42.958\nThe question that I found myself asking to people\n\n00:04:42.958 --> 00:04:44.958\nwhen I was talking about the book afterwards is --\n\n00:04:44.958 --> 00:04:46.958\nwhen you've talked about emergent behavior,\n\n00:04:46.958 --> 00:04:48.958\nwhen you've talked about collective intelligence,\n\n00:04:48.958 --> 00:04:50.958\nthe best way to get people to kind of wrap their heads around that\n\n00:04:50.958 --> 00:04:53.958\nis to ask, who builds a neighborhood?\n\n00:04:53.958 --> 00:04:56.958\nWho decides that Soho should have this personality\n\n00:04:56.958 --> 00:04:58.958\nand that the Latin Quarter should have this personality?\n\n00:04:58.958 --> 00:05:00.958\nWell, there are some kind of executive decisions,\n\n00:05:00.958 --> 00:05:02.958\nbut mostly the answer is -- everybody and nobody.\n\n00:05:02.958 --> 00:05:04.958\nEverybody contributes a little bit.\n\n00:05:04.958 --> 00:05:08.958\nNo single person is really the ultimate actor\n\n00:05:08.958 --> 00:05:10.958\nbehind the personality of a neighborhood.\n\n00:05:10.958 --> 00:05:13.958\nSame thing to the question of, who was keeping the streets alive\n\n00:05:13.958 --> 00:05:15.958\npost-9/11 in my neighborhood?\n\n00:05:15.958 --> 00:05:17.958\nWell, it was the whole city.\n\n00:05:17.958 --> 00:05:19.958\nThe whole system kind of working on it,\n\n00:05:19.958 --> 00:05:21.958\nand everybody contributing a small little part.\n\n00:05:21.958 --> 00:05:24.958\nAnd this is increasingly what we're starting to see on the Web\n\n00:05:24.958 --> 00:05:26.958\nin a bunch of interesting ways --\n\n00:05:26.958 --> 00:05:28.958\nmost of which weren't around, actually,\n\n00:05:28.958 --> 00:05:30.958\nexcept in very experimental things,\n\n00:05:30.958 --> 00:05:32.958\nwhen I was writing \"Emergence\" and when the book came out.\n\n00:05:32.958 --> 00:05:34.958\nSo it's been a very optimistic time, I think,\n\n00:05:34.958 --> 00:05:36.958\nand I want to just talk about a few of those things.\n\n00:05:36.958 --> 00:05:40.958\nI think that there is effectively a new kind of model of interactivity\n\n00:05:40.958 --> 00:05:42.958\nthat's starting to emerge online right now.\n\n00:05:42.958 --> 00:05:45.958\nAnd the old one looked like this.\n\n00:05:47.958 --> 00:05:51.958\nThis is not the future King of England, although it looks like it.\n\n00:05:51.958 --> 00:05:54.958\nIt's some guy, it's a GeoCities homepage of some guy that I found online\n\n00:05:54.958 --> 00:05:57.958\nwho's interested, if you look at the bottom, in soccer and Jesus\n\n00:05:57.958 --> 00:06:00.958\nand Garth Brooks and Clint Beckham and \"my hometown\" -- those are his links.\n\n00:06:00.958 --> 00:06:02.958\nBut nothing really says\n\n00:06:02.958 --> 00:06:06.958\nthis model of interactivity -- which was so exciting and captures the real,\n\n00:06:06.958 --> 00:06:09.958\nthe Web Zeitgeist of 1995 -- than\n\n00:06:09.958 --> 00:06:11.958\n\"Click here for a picture of my dog.\"\n\n00:06:11.958 --> 00:06:13.958\nThat is -- you know, there's no sentence\n\n00:06:13.958 --> 00:06:16.958\nthat kind of conjures up that period better than that, I think,\n\n00:06:17.958 --> 00:06:20.958\nwhich is that you suddenly have the power to put up a picture of your dog\n\n00:06:20.958 --> 00:06:23.958\nand link to it, and somebody reading the page\n\n00:06:23.958 --> 00:06:26.958\nhas the power to click on that link or not click on that link.\n\n00:06:26.958 --> 00:06:29.958\nAnd, you know, I don't want to belittle that. That, in a sense --\n\n00:06:29.958 --> 00:06:32.958\nto reference what Jeff was talking about yesterday --\n\n00:06:32.958 --> 00:06:34.958\nthat was, in a sense, the kind of interface electricity that\n\n00:06:34.958 --> 00:06:37.958\npowered a lot of the explosion of interest in the Web:\n\n00:06:37.958 --> 00:06:39.958\nthat you could put up a link, and somebody could click on it,\n\n00:06:39.958 --> 00:06:41.958\nand it could take you anywhere you wanted to go.\n\n00:06:41.958 --> 00:06:43.958\nBut it's still a very one-to-one kind of relationship.\n\n00:06:43.958 --> 00:06:45.958\nThere's one person putting up the link, and there's another person\n\n00:06:45.958 --> 00:06:49.958\non the other end trying to decide whether to click on it or not.\n\n00:06:50.958 --> 00:06:52.958\nThe new model is much more like this,\n\n00:06:52.958 --> 00:06:54.958\nand we've already seen a couple of references to this.\n\n00:06:54.958 --> 00:06:58.958\nThis is what happens when you search \"Steven Johnson\" on Google.\n\n00:06:58.958 --> 00:07:02.958\nAbout two months ago, I had the great breakthrough --\n\n00:07:02.958 --> 00:07:05.958\none of my great, kind of shining achievements --\n\n00:07:05.958 --> 00:07:08.958\nwhich is that my website finally became a top result for \"Steven Johnson.\"\n\n00:07:08.958 --> 00:07:14.958\nThere's some theoretical physicist at MIT named Steven Johnson\n\n00:07:14.958 --> 00:07:17.958\nwho has dropped two spots, I'm happy to say.\n\n00:07:17.958 --> 00:07:18.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:07:18.958 --> 00:07:22.958\nAnd, you know, I mean, I'll look at a couple of things like this,\n\n00:07:22.958 --> 00:07:26.958\nbut Google is obviously the greatest technology ever invented for navel gazing.\n\n00:07:26.958 --> 00:07:29.958\nIt's just that there are so many other people in your navel when you gaze.\n\n00:07:29.958 --> 00:07:33.958\nBecause effectively, what's happening here,\n\n00:07:34.958 --> 00:07:36.958\nwhat's creating this page, obviously -- and we all know this,\n\n00:07:36.958 --> 00:07:38.958\nbut it's worth just thinking about it --\n\n00:07:38.958 --> 00:07:42.958\nis not some person deciding that I am the number one answer for Steven Johnson,\n\n00:07:42.958 --> 00:07:46.958\nbut rather somehow the entire web of people\n\n00:07:46.958 --> 00:07:49.958\nputting up pages and deciding to link to my page or not link to it,\n\n00:07:49.958 --> 00:07:52.958\nand Google just sitting there and running the numbers.\n\n00:07:52.958 --> 00:07:56.958\nSo there's this collective decision-making that's going on.\n\n00:07:56.958 --> 00:07:59.958\nThis page is effectively, collectively authored by the Web,\n\n00:07:59.958 --> 00:08:01.958\nand Google is just helping us\n\n00:08:01.958 --> 00:08:04.958\nkind of to put the authorship in one kind of coherent place.\n\n00:08:04.958 --> 00:08:07.958\nNow, they're more innovative -- well, Google's pretty innovative --\n\n00:08:07.958 --> 00:08:09.958\nbut there are some new twists on this.\n\n00:08:10.958 --> 00:08:12.958\nThere's this incredibly interesting new site -- Technorati --\n\n00:08:12.958 --> 00:08:16.958\nthat's filled with lots of little widgets that are expanding on these.\n\n00:08:16.958 --> 00:08:20.958\nAnd these are looking in the blog world and the world of weblogs.\n\n00:08:20.958 --> 00:08:24.958\nHe's analyzed basically all the weblogs out there that he's tracking.\n\n00:08:24.958 --> 00:08:27.958\nAnd he's tracking how many other weblogs linked to those weblogs,\n\n00:08:27.958 --> 00:08:29.958\nand so you have kind of an authority --\n\n00:08:29.958 --> 00:08:31.958\na weblog that has a lot of links to it\n\n00:08:31.958 --> 00:08:35.958\nis more authoritative than a weblog that has few links to it.\n\n00:08:36.958 --> 00:08:38.958\nAnd so at any given time, on any given page on the Web, actually,\n\n00:08:38.958 --> 00:08:41.958\nyou can say, what does the weblog community think about this page?\n\n00:08:41.958 --> 00:08:43.958\nAnd you can get a list.\n\n00:08:43.958 --> 00:08:46.958\nThis is what they think about my site; it's ranked by blog authority.\n\n00:08:46.958 --> 00:08:48.958\nYou can also rank it by the latest posts.\n\n00:08:48.958 --> 00:08:51.958\nSo when I was talking in \"Emergence,\"\n\n00:08:51.958 --> 00:08:53.958\nI talked about the limitations of the one-way linking architecture\n\n00:08:53.958 --> 00:08:55.958\nthat, basically, you could link to somebody else\n\n00:08:55.958 --> 00:08:57.958\nbut they wouldn't necessarily know that you were pointing to them.\n\n00:08:57.958 --> 00:09:00.958\nAnd that was one of the reasons why the web\n\n00:09:00.958 --> 00:09:02.958\nwasn't quite as emergent as it could be\n\n00:09:02.958 --> 00:09:04.958\nbecause you needed two-way linking, you needed that kind of feedback mechanism\n\n00:09:04.958 --> 00:09:06.958\nto be able to really do interesting things.\n\n00:09:06.958 --> 00:09:09.958\nWell, something like Technorati is supplying that.\n\n00:09:09.958 --> 00:09:12.958\nNow what's interesting here is that this is a quote from Dave Weinberger,\n\n00:09:12.958 --> 00:09:16.958\nwhere he talks about everything being purposive in the Web --\n\n00:09:16.958 --> 00:09:18.958\nthere's nothing artificial.\n\n00:09:18.958 --> 00:09:20.958\nHe has this line where he says, you know, you're going to put up a link there,\n\n00:09:20.958 --> 00:09:23.958\nif you see a link, somebody decided to put it there.\n\n00:09:23.958 --> 00:09:28.958\nAnd he says, the link to one site didn't just grow on the other page \"like a tree fungus.\"\n\n00:09:28.958 --> 00:09:31.958\nAnd in fact, I think that's not entirely true anymore.\n\n00:09:31.958 --> 00:09:35.958\nI could put up a feed of all those links generated by Technorati\n\n00:09:35.958 --> 00:09:37.958\non the right-hand side of my page,\n\n00:09:37.958 --> 00:09:40.958\nand they would change as the overall ecology of the Web changes.\n\n00:09:40.958 --> 00:09:42.958\nThat little list there would change.\n\n00:09:42.958 --> 00:09:44.958\nI wouldn't really be directly in control of it.\n\n00:09:44.958 --> 00:09:47.958\nSo it's much closer, in a way, to a data fungus, in a sense,\n\n00:09:47.958 --> 00:09:51.958\nwrapped around that page, than it is to a deliberate link that I've placed there.\n\n00:09:53.958 --> 00:09:56.958\nNow, what you're having here is basically a global brain\n\n00:09:56.958 --> 00:09:59.958\nthat you're able to do lots of kind of experiments on to see what it's thinking.\n\n00:09:59.958 --> 00:10:01.958\nAnd there are all these interesting tools.\n\n00:10:01.958 --> 00:10:03.958\nGoogle does the Google Zeitgeist,\n\n00:10:03.958 --> 00:10:08.958\nwhich looks at search requests to test what's going on, what people are interested in,\n\n00:10:08.958 --> 00:10:10.958\nand they publish it with lots of fun graphs.\n\n00:10:10.958 --> 00:10:12.958\nAnd I'm saying a lot of nice things about Google,\n\n00:10:12.958 --> 00:10:13.958\nso I'll be I'll be saying one little critical thing.\n\n00:10:13.958 --> 00:10:15.958\nThere's a problem with the Google Zeitgeist,\n\n00:10:15.958 --> 00:10:19.958\nwhich is it often comes back with news that a lot of people are searching\n\n00:10:19.958 --> 00:10:23.958\nfor Britney Spears pictures, which is not necessarily news.\n\n00:10:23.958 --> 00:10:27.958\nThe Columbia blows up, suddenly there are a lot of searches on Columbia.\n\n00:10:27.958 --> 00:10:29.958\nWell, you know, we should expect to see that.\n\n00:10:29.958 --> 00:10:31.958\nThat's not necessarily something we didn't know already.\n\n00:10:31.958 --> 00:10:33.958\nSo the key thing in terms of these new tools\n\n00:10:33.958 --> 00:10:36.958\nthat are kind of plumbing the depths of the global brain,\n\n00:10:36.958 --> 00:10:40.958\nthat are sending kind of trace dyes through that whole bloodstream --\n\n00:10:40.958 --> 00:10:42.958\nthe question is, are you finding out something new?\n\n00:10:42.958 --> 00:10:45.958\nAnd one of the things that I experimented with is this thing called Google Share\n\n00:10:45.958 --> 00:10:49.958\nwhich is basically, you take an abstract term,\n\n00:10:49.958 --> 00:10:52.958\nand you search Google for that term,\n\n00:10:52.958 --> 00:10:55.958\nand then you search the results that you get back for somebody's name.\n\n00:10:55.958 --> 00:10:59.958\nSo basically, the number of pages that mention this term,\n\n00:10:59.958 --> 00:11:02.958\nthat also mention this page, the percentage of those pages\n\n00:11:02.958 --> 00:11:04.958\nis that person's Google Share of that term.\n\n00:11:04.958 --> 00:11:06.958\nSo you can do kind of interesting contests.\n\n00:11:06.958 --> 00:11:10.958\nLike for instance, this is a Google Share of the TED Conference.\n\n00:11:10.958 --> 00:11:13.958\nSo Richard Saul Wurman\n\n00:11:13.958 --> 00:11:17.958\nhas about a 15 percent Google Share of the TED conference.\n\n00:11:17.958 --> 00:11:22.958\nOur good friend Chris has about a six percent -- but with a bullet, I might add.\n\n00:11:22.958 --> 00:11:24.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:11:24.958 --> 00:11:27.958\nBut the interesting thing is, you can broaden the search a little bit.\n\n00:11:27.958 --> 00:11:30.958\nAnd it turns out, actually, that 42 percent is the Mola mola fish.\n\n00:11:30.958 --> 00:11:32.958\nI had no idea.\n\n00:11:32.958 --> 00:11:33.958\nNo, that's not true.\n\n00:11:33.958 --> 00:11:36.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:11:36.958 --> 00:11:38.958\nI made that up because I just wanted to put up a slide\n\n00:11:38.958 --> 00:11:40.958\nof the Mola mola fish.\n\n00:11:40.958 --> 00:11:42.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:11:42.958 --> 00:11:45.958\nI also did -- and I don't want to start a little fight in the next panel --\n\n00:11:45.958 --> 00:11:48.958\nbut I did a Google Share analysis of evolution and natural selection.\n\n00:11:48.958 --> 00:11:53.958\nSo right here -- now this is a big category, you have smaller percentages,\n\n00:11:53.958 --> 00:11:58.958\nso this is 0.7 percent -- Dan Dennett, who'll be speaking shortly.\n\n00:11:58.958 --> 00:12:02.958\nRight below him, 0.5 percent, Steven Pinker.\n\n00:12:03.958 --> 00:12:05.958\nSo Dennett's in the lead a little bit there.\n\n00:12:05.958 --> 00:12:07.958\nBut what's interesting is you can then broaden the search\n\n00:12:07.958 --> 00:12:11.958\nand actually see interesting things and get a sense of what else is out there.\n\n00:12:11.958 --> 00:12:14.958\nSo Gary Bauer is not too far behind --\n\n00:12:14.958 --> 00:12:19.958\nhas slightly different theories about evolution and natural selection.\n\n00:12:19.958 --> 00:12:22.958\nAnd right behind him is L. Ron Hubbard. So --\n\n00:12:22.958 --> 00:12:24.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:12:24.958 --> 00:12:26.958\nyou can see we're in the ascot, which is always good.\n\n00:12:26.958 --> 00:12:28.958\nAnd by the way, Chris, that would've been a really good panel,\n\n00:12:28.958 --> 00:12:29.958\nI think, right there.\n\n00:12:29.958 --> 00:12:34.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:12:34.958 --> 00:12:36.958\nHubbard apparently started to reach, but besides that,\n\n00:12:36.958 --> 00:12:38.958\nI think it would be good next year.\n\n00:12:38.958 --> 00:12:40.958\nAnother quick thing -- this is a slightly different thing,\n\n00:12:40.958 --> 00:12:42.958\nbut this analysis some of you may have seen.\n\n00:12:42.958 --> 00:12:44.958\nIt just came out. This is bursty words,\n\n00:12:44.958 --> 00:12:48.958\nlooking at the historical record of State of the Union Addresses.\n\n00:12:49.958 --> 00:12:53.958\nSo these are words that suddenly start to appear out of nowhere,\n\n00:12:53.958 --> 00:12:55.958\nso they're kind of, you know, memes that start taking off,\n\n00:12:55.958 --> 00:12:57.958\nthat didn't have a lot of historical precedent before.\n\n00:12:58.958 --> 00:13:01.958\nSo the first one is -- these are the bursty words around 1860s --\n\n00:13:01.958 --> 00:13:03.958\nslaves, emancipation, slavery, rebellion, Kansas.\n\n00:13:04.958 --> 00:13:06.958\nThat's Britney Spears. I mean, you know, OK, interesting.\n\n00:13:06.958 --> 00:13:08.958\nThey're talking about slavery in 1860.\n\n00:13:08.958 --> 00:13:11.958\n1935 -- relief, depression, recovery banks.\n\n00:13:11.958 --> 00:13:14.958\nAnd OK, I didn't learn anything new there as well -- that's pretty obvious.\n\n00:13:14.958 --> 00:13:17.958\n1985, right at the center of the Reagan years --\n\n00:13:18.958 --> 00:13:21.958\nthat's, we're, there's, we've, it's.\n\n00:13:21.958 --> 00:13:23.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:13:23.958 --> 00:13:26.958\nNow, there's one way to interpret this, which is to say that\n\n00:13:26.958 --> 00:13:29.958\n\"emancipation\" and \"depression\" and \"recovery\" all have a lot of syllables.\n\n00:13:29.958 --> 00:13:32.958\nSo you know, you can actually download -- it's hard to remember those.\n\n00:13:34.958 --> 00:13:36.958\nBut seriously, actually, what you can see there,\n\n00:13:36.958 --> 00:13:38.958\nin a way that would be very hard to detect otherwise,\n\n00:13:38.958 --> 00:13:41.958\nis Reagan reinventing the political language of the country\n\n00:13:41.958 --> 00:13:45.958\nand shifting to a much more intimate, much more folksy, much more telegenic --\n\n00:13:45.958 --> 00:13:47.958\ncontracting all those verbs.\n\n00:13:47.958 --> 00:13:49.958\nYou know, 20 years before it was still, \"Ask not what you can do,\"\n\n00:13:49.958 --> 00:13:54.958\nbut with Reagan, it's, \"that's where, there's Nancy and I,\" that kind of language.\n\n00:13:54.958 --> 00:13:57.958\nAnd so something we kind of knew,\n\n00:13:57.958 --> 00:13:59.958\nbut you didn't actually notice syntactically what he was doing.\n\n00:13:59.958 --> 00:14:01.958\nI'll go very quickly.\n\n00:14:01.958 --> 00:14:03.958\nThe question now -- and this is the really interesting question --\n\n00:14:03.958 --> 00:14:07.958\nis, what kind of higher-level shape is emerging right now\n\n00:14:07.958 --> 00:14:11.958\nin the overall Web ecosystem -- and particularly in the ecosystem of the blogs\n\n00:14:11.958 --> 00:14:14.958\nbecause they are really kind of at the cutting edge.\n\n00:14:14.958 --> 00:14:16.958\nAnd I think what happens there will also happen in the wider system.\n\n00:14:16.958 --> 00:14:19.958\nNow there was a very interesting article by Clay Shirky\n\n00:14:19.958 --> 00:14:21.958\nthat got a lot of attention about a month ago,\n\n00:14:21.958 --> 00:14:23.958\nand this is basically the distribution of links\n\n00:14:23.958 --> 00:14:26.958\non the web to all these various different blogs.\n\n00:14:28.958 --> 00:14:33.958\nIt follows a power law, so that there are a few extremely well-linked to, popular blogs,\n\n00:14:33.958 --> 00:14:37.958\nand a long tail of blogs with very few links.\n\n00:14:37.958 --> 00:14:40.958\nSo 20 percent of the blogs get 80 percent of the links.\n\n00:14:40.958 --> 00:14:42.958\nNow this is a very interesting thing.\n\n00:14:42.958 --> 00:14:44.958\nIt's caused a lot of controversy\n\n00:14:44.958 --> 00:14:46.958\nbecause people thought that this was the ultimate kind of one man,\n\n00:14:46.958 --> 00:14:50.958\none modem democracy, where anybody can get out there and get their voice heard.\n\n00:14:50.958 --> 00:14:52.958\nAnd so the question is, \"Why is this happening?\"\n\n00:14:52.958 --> 00:14:56.958\nIt's not being imposed by fiat from above.\n\n00:14:56.958 --> 00:14:59.958\nIt's an emergent property of the blogosphere right now.\n\n00:14:59.958 --> 00:15:02.958\nNow, what's great about it is that people are working on --\n\n00:15:02.958 --> 00:15:07.958\nwithin seconds of Clay publishing this piece, people started working on changing\n\n00:15:07.958 --> 00:15:10.958\nthe underlying rules of the system so that a different shape would start appearing.\n\n00:15:10.958 --> 00:15:12.958\nAnd basically, the shape appears\n\n00:15:12.958 --> 00:15:14.958\nlargely because of a kind of a first-mover advantage.\n\n00:15:14.958 --> 00:15:16.958\nif you're the first site there, everybody links to you.\n\n00:15:16.958 --> 00:15:18.958\nIf you're the second site there, most people link to you.\n\n00:15:18.958 --> 00:15:21.958\nAnd so very quickly you can accumulate a bunch of links,\n\n00:15:21.958 --> 00:15:23.958\nand it makes it more likely for newcomers to link to you in the future,\n\n00:15:23.958 --> 00:15:25.958\nand then you get this kind of shape.\n\n00:15:25.958 --> 00:15:28.958\nAnd so what Dave Sifry at Technorati started working on,\n\n00:15:28.958 --> 00:15:31.958\nliterally as Shirky started -- after he published his piece --\n\n00:15:31.958 --> 00:15:35.958\nwas something that basically just gave a new kind of priority to newcomers.\n\n00:15:35.958 --> 00:15:38.958\nAnd he started looking at interesting newcomers that don't have a lot of links,\n\n00:15:38.958 --> 00:15:42.958\nthat suddenly get a bunch of links in the last 24 hours.\n\n00:15:42.958 --> 00:15:45.958\nSo in a sense, bursty weblogs coming from new voices.\n\n00:15:45.958 --> 00:15:50.958\nSo he's working on a tool right there that can actually change the overall system.\n\n00:15:50.958 --> 00:15:52.958\nAnd it creates a kind of planned emergence.\n\n00:15:52.958 --> 00:15:54.958\nYou're not totally in control,\n\n00:15:54.958 --> 00:15:56.958\nbut you're changing the underlying rules in interesting ways\n\n00:15:56.958 --> 00:15:58.958\nbecause you have an end result which is\n\n00:15:58.958 --> 00:16:00.958\nmaybe a more democratic spread of voices.\n\n00:16:00.958 --> 00:16:02.958\nSo the most amazing thing about this -- and I'll end on this note --\n\n00:16:02.958 --> 00:16:05.958\nis, most emergent systems, most self-organizing systems\n\n00:16:05.958 --> 00:16:10.958\nare not made up of component parts that are capable of looking at the overall pattern\n\n00:16:10.958 --> 00:16:13.958\nand changing their behavior based on whether they like the pattern or not.\n\n00:16:14.958 --> 00:16:16.958\nSo the most wonderful thing, I think, about this whole debate\n\n00:16:16.958 --> 00:16:18.958\nabout power laws and software that could change it\n\n00:16:18.958 --> 00:16:21.958\nis the fact that we're having the conversation.\n\n00:16:21.958 --> 00:16:23.958\nI hope it continues here.\n\n00:16:23.958 --> 00:16:24.958\nThanks a lot."}, {"title": "Playing invisible turntables", "duration": "284", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/james_burchfield_plays_invisible_turntables", "transcript": "Let's just

Sweet. Actually, for the next 18 minutes I'm going to do the best I can to describe the beauty of particle physics without equations. It turns out there's a lot we can learn from coral. A coral is a very beautiful and unusual animal. Each coral head consists of thousands of individual polyps. These polyps are continually budding and branching into genetically identical neighbors. If we imagine this to be a hyperintelligent coral, we can single out an individual and ask him a reasonable question. We can ask how exactly he got to be in this particular location compared to his neighbors \u2014 if it was just chance, or destiny, or what?Now, after admonishing us for turning the temperature up too high, he would tell us that our question was completely stupid. These corals can be kind of mean, you see, and I have surfing scars to prove that. But this polyp would continue and tell us that his neighbors were quite clearly identical copies of him. That he was in all these other locations as well, but experiencing them as separate individuals. For a coral, branching into different copies is the most natural thing in the world.Unlike us, a hyperintelligent coral would be uniquely prepared to understand quantum mechanics. The mathematics of quantum mechanics very accurately describes how our universe works. And it tells us our reality is continually branching into different possibilities, just like a coral. It's a weird thing for us humans to wrap our minds around, since we only ever get to experience one possibility. This quantum weirdness was first described by Erwin Schr\u00f6dinger and his cat. The cat likes this version better.(Laughter)In this setup, Schr\u00f6dinger is in a box with a radioactive sample that, by the laws of quantum mechanics, branches into a state in which it is radiated and a state in which it is not.(Laughter)In the branch in which the sample radiates, it sets off a trigger that releases poison and Schr\u00f6dinger is dead. But in the other branch of reality, he remains alive. These realities are experienced separately by each individual. As far as either can tell, the other one doesn't exist.This seems weird to us, because each of us only experiences an individual existence, and we don't get to see other branches. It's as if each of us, like Schr\u00f6dinger here, are a kind of coral branching into different possibilities. The mathematics of quantum mechanics tells us this is how the world works at tiny scales. It can be summed up in a single sentence: Everything that can happen, does. That's quantum mechanics. But this does not mean everything happens. The rest of physics is about describing what can happen and what can't. What physics tells us is that everything comes down to geometry and the interactions of elementary particles. And things can happen only if these interactions are perfectly balanced.Now I'll go ahead and describe how we know about these particles, what they are and how this balance works. In this machine, a beam of protons and antiprotons are accelerated to near the speed of light and brought together in a collision, producing a burst of pure energy. This energy is immediately converted into a spray of subatomic particles, with detectors and computers used to figure out their properties. This enormous machine \u2014 the Large Hadron Collider at CERN in Geneva \u2014 has a circumference of 17 miles and, when it's operating, draws five times as much power as the city of Monterey. We can't predict specifically what particles will be produced in any individual collision. Quantum mechanics tells us all possibilities are realized. But physics does tell us what particles can be produced. These particles must have just as much mass and energy as is carried in by the proton and antiproton. Any particles more massive than this energy limit aren't produced, and remain invisible to us. This is why this new particle accelerator is so exciting. It's going to push this energy limit seven times beyond what's ever been done before, so we're going to get to see some new particles very soon.But before talking about what we might see, let me describe the particles we already know of. There's a whole zoo of subatomic particles. Most of us are familiar with electrons. A lot of people in this room make a good living pushing them around.(Laughter)But the electron also has a neutral partner called the neutrino, with no electric charge and a very tiny mass. In contrast, the up and down quarks have very large masses, and combine in threes to make the protons and neutrons inside atoms. All of these matter particles come in left- and right-handed varieties, and have antiparticle partners that carry opposite charges. These familiar particles also have less familiar second and third generations, which have the same charges as the first but have much higher masses. These matter particles all interact with the various force particles. The electromagnetic force interacts with electrically charged matter via particles called photons. There is also a very weak force called, rather unimaginatively, the weak force ...(Laughter)that interacts only with left-handed matter. The strong force acts between quarks which carry a different kind of charge, called color charge, and come in three different varieties: red, green and blue. You can blame Murray Gell-Mann for these names \u2014 they're his fault. Finally, there's the force of gravity, which interacts with matter via its mass and spin.The most important thing to understand here is that there's a different kind of charge associated with each of these forces. These four different forces interact with matter according to the corresponding charges that each particle has. A particle that hasn't been seen yet, but we're pretty sure exists, is the Higgs particle, which gives masses to all these other particles. The main purpose of the Large Hadron Collider is to see this Higgs particle, and we're almost certain it will. But the greatest mystery is what else we might see. And I'm going to show you one beautiful possibility towards the end of this talk.Now, if we count up all these different particles using their various spins and charges, there are 226. That's a lot of particles to keep track of. And it seems strange that nature would have so many elementary particles. But if we plot them out according to their charges, some beautiful patterns emerge. The most familiar charge is electric charge. Electrons have an electric charge, a negative one, and quarks have electric charges in thirds. So when two up quarks and a down quark are combined to make a proton, it has a total electric charge of plus one. These particles also have antiparticles, which have opposite charges. Now, it turns out the electric charge is actually a combination of two other charges: hypercharge and weak charge. If we spread out the hypercharge and weak charge and plot the charges of particles in this two-dimensional charge space, the electric charge is where these particles sit along the vertical direction. The electromagnetic and weak forces interact with matter according to their hypercharge and weak charge, which make this pattern. This is called the unified electroweak model, and it was put together back in 1967.The reason most of us are only familiar with electric charge and not both of these is because of the Higgs particle. The Higgs, over here on the left, has a large mass and breaks the symmetry of this electroweak pattern. It makes the weak force very weak by giving the weak particles a large mass. Since this massive Higgs sits along the horizontal direction in this diagram, the photons of electromagnetism remain massless and interact with electric charge along the vertical direction in this charge space. So the electromagnetic and weak forces are described by this pattern of particle charges in two-dimensional space. We can include the strong force by spreading out its two charge directions and plotting the charges of the force particles in quarks along these directions. The charges of all known particles can be plotted in a four-dimensional charge space, and projected down to two dimensions like this so we can see them.Whenever particles interact, nature keeps things in a perfect balance along all four of these charge directions. If a particle and an antiparticle collide, it creates a burst of energy and a total charge of zero in all four charge directions. At this point, anything can be created as long as it has the same energy and maintains a total charge of zero. For example, this weak force particle and its antiparticle can be created in a collision. In further interactions, the charges must always balance. One of the weak particles could decay into an electron and an antineutrino, and these three still add to zero total charge. Nature always keeps a perfect balance. So these patterns of charges are not just pretty. They tell us what interactions are allowed to happen. And we can rotate this charge space in four dimensions to get a better look at the strong interaction, which has this nice hexagonal symmetry. In a strong interaction, a strong force particle, such as this one, interacts with a colored quark, such as this green one, to give a quark with a different color charge \u2014 this red one. And strong interactions are happening millions of times each second in every atom of our bodies, holding the atomic nuclei together.But these four charges corresponding to three forces are not the end of the story. We can also include two more charges corresponding to the gravitational force. When we include these, each matter particle has two different spin charges, spin-up and spin-down. So they all split and give a nice pattern in six-dimensional charge space. We can rotate this pattern in six dimensions and see that it's quite pretty. Right now, this pattern matches our best current knowledge of how nature is built at the tiny scales of these elementary particles. This is what we know for certain. Some of these particles are at the very limit of what we've been able to reach with experiments. From this pattern we already know the particle physics of these tiny scales \u2014 the way the universe works at these tiny scales is very beautiful.But now I'm going to discuss some new and old ideas about things we don't know yet. We want to expand this pattern using mathematics alone, and see if we can get our hands on the whole enchilada. We want to find all the particles and forces that make a complete picture of our universe. And we want to use this picture to predict new particles that we'll see when experiments reach higher energies.So there's an old idea in particle physics that this known pattern of charges, which is not very symmetric, could emerge from a more perfect pattern that gets broken \u2014 similar to how the Higgs particle breaks the electroweak pattern to give electromagnetism. In order to do this, we need to introduce new forces with new charge directions. When we introduce a new direction, we get to guess what charges the particles have along this direction, and then we can rotate it in with the others. If we guess wisely, we can construct the standard charges in six charge dimensions as a broken symmetry of this more perfect pattern in seven charge dimensions.This particular choice corresponds to a grand unified theory introduced by Pati and Salam in 1973. When we look at this new unified pattern, we can see a couple of gaps where particles seem to be missing. This is the way theories of unification work. A physicist looks for larger, more symmetric patterns that include the established pattern as a subset. The larger pattern allows us to predict the existence of particles that have never been seen. This unification model predicts the existence of these two new force particles, which should act a lot like the weak force, only weaker.Now, we can rotate this set of charges in seven dimensions and consider an odd fact about the matter particles: the second and third generations of matter have exactly the same charges in six-dimensional charge space as the first generation. These particles are not uniquely identified by their six charges. They sit on top of one another in the standard charge space. However, if we work in eight-dimensional charge space, then we can assign unique new charges to each particle. Then we can spin these in eight dimensions and see what the whole pattern looks like. Here we can see the second and third generations of matter now, related to the first generation by a symmetry called \"triality.\"This particular pattern of charges in eight dimensions is actually part of the most beautiful geometric structure in mathematics. It's a pattern of the largest exceptional Lie group, E8. This Lie group is a smooth, curved shape with 248 dimensions. Each point in this pattern corresponds to a symmetry of this very complex and beautiful shape. One small part of this E8 shape can be used to describe the curved space-time of Einstein's general relativity, explaining gravity. Together with quantum mechanics, the geometry of this shape could describe everything about how the universe works at the tiniest scales. The pattern of this shape living in eight-dimensional charge space is exquisitely beautiful, and it summarizes thousands of possible interactions between these elementary particles, each of which is just a facet of this complicated shape.As we spin it, we can see many of the other intricate patterns contained in this one. And with a particular rotation, we can look down through this pattern in eight dimensions along a symmetry axis and see all the particles at once. It's a very beautiful object, and as with any unification, we can see some holes where new particles are required by this pattern. There are 20 gaps where new particles should be, two of which have been filled by the Pati-Salam particles. From their location in this pattern, we know that these new particles should be scalar fields like the Higgs particle, but have color charge and interact with the strong force. Filling in these new particles completes this pattern, giving us the full E8.This E8 pattern has very deep mathematical roots. It's considered by many to be the most beautiful structure in mathematics. It's a fantastic prospect that this object of great mathematical beauty could describe the truth of particle interactions at the smallest scales imaginable. And this idea that nature is described by mathematics is not at all new. In 1623, Galileo wrote this: \"Nature's grand book, which stands continually open to our gaze, is written in the language of mathematics. Its characters are triangles, circles and other geometrical figures, without which it is humanly impossible to understand a single word of it; without these, one is wandering around in a dark labyrinth.\"I believe this to be true, and I've tried to follow Galileo's guidance in describing the mathematics of particle physics using only triangles, circles and other geometrical figures. Of course, when other physicists and I actually work on this stuff, the mathematics can resemble a dark labyrinth. But it's reassuring that at the heart of this mathematics is pure, beautiful geometry. Joined with quantum mechanics, this mathematics describes our universe as a growing E8 coral, with particles interacting at every location in all possible ways according to a beautiful pattern. And as more of the pattern comes into view using new machines like the Large Hadron Collider, we may be able to see whether nature uses this E8 pattern or a different one.This process of discovery is a wonderful adventure to be involved in. If the LHC finds particles that fit this E8 pattern, that will be very, very cool. If the LHC finds new particles, but they don't fit this pattern \u2014 well, that will be very interesting, but bad for this E8 theory. And, of course, bad for me personally.(Laughter)Now, how bad would that be? Well, pretty bad.(Laughter)But predicting how nature works is a very risky game. This theory and others like it are long shots. One does a lot of hard work knowing that most of these ideas probably won't end up being true about nature. That's what doing theoretical physics is like: there are a lot of wipeouts. In this regard, new physics theories are a lot like start-up companies. As with any large investment, it can be emotionally difficult to abandon a line of research when it isn't working out. But in science, if something isn't working, you have to toss it out and try something else.Now, the only way to maintain sanity and achieve happiness in the midst of this uncertainty is to keep balance and perspective in life. I've tried the best I can to live a balanced life.(Laughter)I try to balance my life equally between physics, love and surfing \u2014 my own three charge directions.(Laughter)This way, even if the physics I work on comes to nothing, I still know I've lived a good life. And I try to live in beautiful places. For most of the past ten years I've lived on the island of Maui, a very beautiful place. Now, it's one of the greatest mysteries in the universe to my parents how I managed to survive all that time without engaging in anything resembling full-time employment.(Laughter)I'm going to let you in on that secret. This was a view from my home office on Maui. And this is another, and another. And you may have noticed that these beautiful views are similar, but in slightly different places. That's because this used to be my home and office on Maui.(Laughter)I've chosen a very unusual life. But not worrying about rent allowed me to spend my time doing what I love. Living a nomadic existence has been hard at times, but it's allowed me to live in beautiful places and keep a balance in my life that I've been happy with. It allows me to spend a lot of my time hanging out with hyperintelligent coral. But I also greatly enjoy the company of hyperintelligent people. So I'm very happy to have been invited here to TED.Thank you very much.(Applause)Chris Anderson: Stay here one second.(Applause)I probably understood two percent of that, but I still absolutely loved it. So I'm going to sound dumb. Your theory of everything \u2014Garrett Lisi: I'm used to coral.CA: That's right. The reason it's got a few people at least excited is because, if you're right, it brings gravity and quantum theory together. So are you saying that we should think of the universe, at its heart \u2014 that the smallest things that there are, are somehow an E8 object of possibility? I mean, is there a scale to it, at the smallest scale, or ...?GL: Well, right now the pattern I showed you that corresponds to what we know about elementary particle physics \u2014 that already corresponds to a very beautiful shape. And that's the one that I said we knew for certain. And that shape has remarkable similarities \u2014 and the way it fits into this E8 pattern, which could be the rest of the picture. And these patterns of points that I've shown for you actually represent symmetries of this high-dimensional object that would be warping and moving and dancing over the space-time that we experience. And that would be what explains all these elementary particles that we see.CA: But a string theorist, as I understand it, explains electrons in terms of much smaller strings vibrating \u2014 I know, you don't like string theory \u2014 vibrating inside it. How should we think of an electron in relation to E8?GL: Well, it would be one of the symmetries of this E8 shape. So what's happening is, as the shape is moving over space-time, it's twisting. And the direction it's twisting as it moves is what particle we see. So it would be \u2014CA: The size of the E8 shape, how does that relate to the electron? I feel like I need that for my picture. Is it bigger? Is it smaller?GL: As far as we know, electrons are point particles, so this would be going down to the smallest possible scales. So the way these things are explained in quantum field theory is, all possibilities are expanding and developing at once. And this is why I use the analogy to coral. And \u2014 in this way, the way that E8 comes in is it will be as a shape that's attached at each point in the space-time. And, as I said, the way the shape twists \u2014 the directional along which way the shape is twisting as it moves over this curved surface \u2014 is what the elementary particles are, themselves. So through quantum field theory, they manifest themselves as points and interact that way. I don't know if I'll be able to make this any clearer.(Laughter)CA: It doesn't really matter. It's evoking a kind of sense of wonder, and I certainly want to understand more of this.But thank you so much for coming. That was absolutely fascinating.(Applause)", "id": 371, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:14.598 --> 00:00:17.214\nWhoa, dude.\n\n00:00:17.238 --> 00:00:18.454\n(Laughter)\n\n00:00:18.478 --> 00:00:21.318\nCheck out those killer equations.

coral\n\n00:01:31.678 --> 00:01:34.478\nwould be uniquely prepared\nto understand quantum mechanics.\n\n00:01:35.798 --> 00:01:37.534\nThe mathematics of quantum mechanics\n\n00:01:37.558 -->

--> 00:01:45.200\njust like a coral.\n\n00:01:46.438 --> 00:01:49.174\nIt's a weird thing for us humans\nto wrap our minds around,\n\n00:01:49.198 --> 00:01:52.054\nsince we only ever get\nto

us,\n\n00:02:31.078 --> 00:02:33.934\nbecause each of us\nonly experiences an individual existence,\n\n00:02:33.958 --> 00:02:36.054\nand we don't get to see other branches.\n\n00:02:36.078 --> 00:02:38.374\nIt's as if each of us,\nlike Schr\u00f6dinger here,\n\n00:02:38.398 --> 00:02:41.558\nare a kind of coral\nbranching into different possibilities.\n\n00:02:42.838 --> 00:02:44.974\nThe

sentence:\n\n00:02:50.278 --> 00:02:52.294\nEverything that can happen, does.\n\n00:02:52.318 --> 00:02:53.774\nThat's quantum mechanics.\n\n00:02:53.798 --> 00:02:56.534\nBut this does not mean everything happens.\n\n00:02:56.558 --> 00:02:59.958\nThe rest of physics is about describing\nwhat can happen and what can't.\n\n00:03:00.918 --> 00:03:04.054\nWhat physics tells us\nis that everything comes down to geometry\n\n00:03:04.078 --> 00:03:06.198\nand the interactions\nof elementary particles.\n\n00:03:06.798 --> 00:03:10.278\nAnd things can happen only if\nthese interactions are perfectly balanced.\n\n00:03:12.558 --> 00:03:15.614\nNow I'll go ahead and describe\nhow we know about these particles,\n\n00:03:15.638 --> 00:03:17.678\nwhat they are and how this balance works.\n\n00:03:19.078 --> 00:03:22.014\nIn this machine,\na beam of protons and antiprotons\n\n00:03:22.038 --> 00:03:24.054\nare accelerated to near the speed of light\n\n00:03:24.078 --> 00:03:27.734\nand brought together in a collision,\nproducing a burst of pure energy.\n\n00:03:27.758 --> 00:03:31.654\nThis energy is immediately converted\ninto a spray of subatomic particles,\n\n00:03:31.678 --> 00:03:34.974\nwith detectors and computers\nused to figure out their properties.\n\n00:03:34.998 --> 00:03:36.254\nThis enormous machine --\n\n00:03:36.278 --> 00:03:38.454\nthe Large Hadron Collider\nat CERN in Geneva --\n\n00:03:38.478 --> 00:03:41.174\nhas a circumference of 17 miles\nand, when it's operating,\n\n00:03:41.198 --> 00:03:43.798\ndraws five times as much power\nas the city of Monterey.\n\n00:03:44.798 --> 00:03:46.654\nWe can't predict specifically\n\n00:03:46.678 --> 00:03:49.614\nwhat particles will be produced\nin any individual collision.\n\n00:03:49.638 --> 00:03:52.358\nQuantum mechanics tells us\nall possibilities are realized.\n\n00:03:53.038 --> 00:03:55.678\nBut physics does tell us\nwhat particles can be produced.\n\n00:03:56.478 --> 00:03:59.014\nThese particles must have\njust as much mass and energy\n\n00:03:59.038 --> 00:04:01.398\nas is carried in\nby the proton and antiproton.\n\n00:04:02.518 --> 00:04:05.774\nAny particles more massive\nthan this energy limit aren't produced,\n\n00:04:05.798 --> 00:04:07.198\nand remain invisible to us.\n\n00:04:08.798 --> 00:04:11.854\nThis is why this new\nparticle accelerator is so exciting.\n\n00:04:11.878 --> 00:04:14.134\nIt's going to push\nthis energy limit seven times\n\n00:04:14.158 --> 00:04:15.894\nbeyond what's ever been done before,\n\n00:04:15.918 --> 00:04:18.638\nso we're going to get to see\nsome new particles very soon.\n\n00:04:19.318 --> 00:04:21.454\nBut before talking\nabout what we might see,\n\n00:04:21.478 --> 00:04:23.798\nlet me describe the particles\nwe already know of.\n\n00:04:24.358 --> 00:04:26.518\nThere's a whole zoo\nof subatomic particles.\n\n00:04:27.158 --> 00:04:29.054\nMost of us are familiar with electrons.\n\n00:04:29.078 --> 00:04:32.294\nA lot of people in this room\nmake a good living pushing them around.\n\n00:04:32.318 --> 00:04:33.494\n(Laughter)\n\n00:04:33.518 --> 00:04:36.534\nBut the electron also has\na neutral partner called the neutrino,\n\n00:04:36.558 --> 00:04:38.678\nwith no electric charge\nand a very tiny mass.\n\n00:04:39.358 --> 00:04:42.814\nIn contrast, the up and down quarks\nhave very large masses,\n\n00:04:42.838 --> 00:04:46.038\nand combine in threes to make\nthe protons and neutrons inside atoms.\n\n00:04:46.718 --> 00:04:50.054\nAll of these matter particles\ncome in left- and right-handed varieties,\n\n00:04:50.078 --> 00:04:52.840\nand have antiparticle partners\nthat carry opposite charges.\n\n00:04:54.318 --> 00:04:55.574\nThese familiar particles\n\n00:04:55.598 --> 00:04:58.614\nalso have less familiar\nsecond and third generations,\n\n00:04:58.638 --> 00:05:02.158\nwhich have the same charges as the first\nbut have much higher masses.\n\n00:05:03.638 --> 00:05:07.174\nThese matter particles all interact\nwith the various force particles.\n\n00:05:07.198 --> 00:05:10.414\nThe electromagnetic force\ninteracts with electrically charged matter\n\n00:05:10.438 --> 00:05:12.254\nvia particles called photons.\n\n00:05:12.278 --> 00:05:13.814\nThere is also a very weak force\n\n00:05:13.838 --> 00:05:16.571\ncalled, rather unimaginatively,\nthe weak force ...\n\n00:05:16.595 --> 00:05:17.734\n(Laughter)\n\n00:05:17.758 --> 00:05:20.166\nthat interacts\nonly with left-handed matter.\n\n00:05:20.398 --> 00:05:22.414\nThe strong force acts between quarks\n\n00:05:22.438 --> 00:05:25.574\nwhich carry a different kind of charge,\ncalled color charge,\n\n00:05:25.598 --> 00:05:28.374\nand come in three different varieties:\nred, green and blue.\n\n00:05:28.398 --> 00:05:31.598\nYou can blame Murray Gell-Mann\nfor these names -- they're his fault.\n\n00:05:32.118 --> 00:05:34.214\nFinally, there's the force of gravity,\n\n00:05:34.238 --> 00:05:37.334\nwhich interacts with matter\nvia its mass and spin.\n\n00:05:37.358 --> 00:05:39.574\nThe most important thing\nto understand here\n\n00:05:39.598 --> 00:05:43.398\nis that there's a different kind of charge\nassociated with each of these forces.\n\n00:05:43.958 --> 00:05:46.214\nThese four different forces\ninteract with matter\n\n00:05:46.238 --> 00:05:49.143\naccording to the corresponding charges\nthat each particle has.\n\n00:05:50.598 --> 00:05:53.774\nA particle that hasn't been seen yet,\nbut we're pretty sure exists,\n\n00:05:53.798 --> 00:05:57.494\nis the Higgs particle, which gives masses\nto all these other particles.\n\n00:05:57.518 --> 00:05:59.654\nThe main purpose\nof the Large Hadron Collider\n\n00:05:59.678 --> 00:06:02.718\nis to see this Higgs particle,\nand we're almost certain it will.\n\n00:06:03.078 --> 00:06:05.958\nBut the greatest mystery\nis what else we might see.\n\n00:06:07.118 --> 00:06:09.534\nAnd I'm going to show you\none beautiful possibility\n\n00:06:09.558 --> 00:06:10.939\ntowards the end of this talk.\n\n00:06:12.158 --> 00:06:14.494\nNow, if we count up\nall these different particles\n\n00:06:14.518 --> 00:06:16.374\nusing their various spins and charges,\n\n00:06:16.398 --> 00:06:17.718\nthere are 226.\n\n00:06:18.358 --> 00:06:20.398\nThat's a lot of particles\nto keep track of.\n\n00:06:20.838 --> 00:06:22.054\nAnd it seems strange\n\n00:06:22.078 --> 00:06:24.638\nthat nature would have\nso many elementary particles.\n\n00:06:25.638 --> 00:06:28.294\nBut if we plot them out\naccording to their charges,\n\n00:06:28.318 --> 00:06:29.958\nsome beautiful patterns emerge.\n\n00:06:32.078 --> 00:06:34.358\nThe most familiar charge\nis electric charge.\n\n00:06:34.798 --> 00:06:36.454\nElectrons have an electric charge,\n\n00:06:36.478 --> 00:06:37.694\na negative one,\n\n00:06:37.718 --> 00:06:39.734\nand quarks have\nelectric charges in thirds.\n\n00:06:39.758 --> 00:06:43.014\nSo when two up quarks and a down quark\nare combined to make a proton,\n\n00:06:43.038 --> 00:06:45.054\nit has a total\nelectric charge of plus one.\n\n00:06:45.078 --> 00:06:48.334\nThese particles also have antiparticles,\nwhich have opposite charges.\n\n00:06:48.358 --> 00:06:50.174\nNow, it turns out the electric charge\n\n00:06:50.198 --> 00:06:52.694\nis actually a combination\nof two other charges:\n\n00:06:52.718 --> 00:06:54.318\nhypercharge and weak charge.\n\n00:06:55.398 --> 00:06:57.718\nIf we spread out\nthe hypercharge and weak charge\n\n00:06:58.720 --> 00:07:02.054\nand plot the charges of particles\nin this two-dimensional charge space,\n\n00:07:02.078 --> 00:07:04.334\nthe electric charge\nis where these particles sit\n\n00:07:04.358 --> 00:07:05.758\nalong the vertical direction.\n\n00:07:06.398 --> 00:07:09.054\nThe electromagnetic\nand weak forces interact with matter\n\n00:07:09.078 --> 00:07:11.294\naccording to their hypercharge\nand weak charge,\n\n00:07:11.318 --> 00:07:12.574\nwhich make this pattern.\n\n00:07:12.598 --> 00:07:14.734\nThis is called\nthe unified electroweak model,\n\n00:07:14.758 --> 00:07:16.958\nand it was put together back in 1967.\n\n00:07:17.678 --> 00:07:20.534\nThe reason most of us\nare only familiar with electric charge\n\n00:07:20.558 --> 00:07:23.158\nand not both of these\nis because of the Higgs particle.\n\n00:07:24.358 --> 00:07:27.094\nThe Higgs, over here on the left,\nhas a large mass\n\n00:07:27.118 --> 00:07:29.574\nand breaks the symmetry\nof this electroweak pattern.\n\n00:07:29.598 --> 00:07:33.174\nIt makes the weak force very weak\nby giving the weak particles a large mass.\n\n00:07:33.198 --> 00:07:37.294\nSince this massive Higgs sits along\nthe horizontal direction in this diagram,\n\n00:07:37.318 --> 00:07:39.614\nthe photons of electromagnetism\nremain massless\n\n00:07:39.638 --> 00:07:42.574\nand interact with electric charge\nalong the vertical direction\n\n00:07:42.598 --> 00:07:43.838\nin this charge space.\n\n00:07:45.918 --> 00:07:47.774\nSo the electromagnetic and weak forces\n\n00:07:47.798 --> 00:07:50.134\nare described by this pattern\nof particle charges\n\n00:07:50.158 --> 00:07:51.534\nin two-dimensional space.\n\n00:07:51.558 --> 00:07:55.078\nWe can include the strong force\nby spreading out its two charge directions\n\n00:07:56.558 --> 00:07:59.254\nand plotting the charges\nof the force particles in quarks\n\n00:07:59.278 --> 00:08:00.518\nalong these directions.\n\n00:08:01.198 --> 00:08:02.854\nThe charges of all known particles\n\n00:08:02.878 --> 00:08:05.254\ncan be plotted in\na four-dimensional charge space,\n\n00:08:05.278 --> 00:08:08.454\nand projected down to two dimensions\nlike this so we can see them.\n\n00:08:08.478 --> 00:08:12.254\nWhenever particles interact,\nnature keeps things in a perfect balance\n\n00:08:12.278 --> 00:08:14.438\nalong all four of these charge directions.\n\n00:08:15.078 --> 00:08:17.134\nIf a particle and an antiparticle collide,\n\n00:08:17.158 --> 00:08:19.814\nit creates a burst of energy\nand a total charge of zero\n\n00:08:19.838 --> 00:08:21.278\nin all four charge directions.\n\n00:08:21.878 --> 00:08:23.894\nAt this point, anything can be created\n\n00:08:23.918 --> 00:08:27.278\nas long as it has the same energy\nand maintains a total charge of zero.\n\n00:08:28.118 --> 00:08:31.334\nFor example, this weak force particle\nand its antiparticle\n\n00:08:31.358 --> 00:08:33.134\ncan be created in a collision.\n\n00:08:33.158 --> 00:08:36.054\nIn further interactions,\nthe charges must always balance.\n\n00:08:36.078 --> 00:08:40.398\nOne of the weak particles could decay\ninto an electron and an antineutrino,\n\n00:08:41.118 --> 00:08:43.774\nand these three\nstill add to zero total charge.\n\n00:08:43.798 --> 00:08:45.877\nNature always keeps a perfect balance.\n\n00:08:46.757 --> 00:08:49.694\nSo these patterns of charges\nare not just pretty.\n\n00:08:49.718 --> 00:08:52.214\nThey tell us what interactions\nare allowed to happen.\n\n00:08:52.238 --> 00:08:54.853\nAnd we can rotate this charge space\nin four dimensions\n\n00:08:54.877 --> 00:08:57.654\nto get a better look\nat the strong interaction,\n\n00:08:57.678 --> 00:08:59.934\nwhich has this nice hexagonal symmetry.\n\n00:08:59.958 --> 00:09:03.294\nIn a strong interaction,\na strong force particle,\n\n00:09:03.318 --> 00:09:04.534\nsuch as this one,\n\n00:09:04.558 --> 00:09:07.318\ninteracts with a colored quark,\nsuch as this green one,\n\n00:09:08.118 --> 00:09:11.023\nto give a quark with a different\ncolor charge -- this red one.\n\n00:09:12.118 --> 00:09:14.734\nAnd strong interactions\nare happening millions of times\n\n00:09:14.758 --> 00:09:16.894\neach second in every atom of our bodies,\n\n00:09:16.918 --> 00:09:18.598\nholding the atomic nuclei together.\n\n00:09:20.958 --> 00:09:23.814\nBut these four charges\ncorresponding to three forces\n\n00:09:23.838 --> 00:09:25.238\nare not the end of the story.\n\n00:09:25.878 --> 00:09:29.814\nWe can also include two more charges\ncorresponding to the gravitational force.\n\n00:09:29.838 --> 00:09:31.134\nWhen we include these,\n\n00:09:31.158 --> 00:09:33.814\neach matter particle\nhas two different spin charges,\n\n00:09:33.838 --> 00:09:35.814\nspin-up and spin-down.\n\n00:09:35.838 --> 00:09:39.894\nSo they all split and give a nice pattern\nin six-dimensional charge space.\n\n00:09:39.918 --> 00:09:42.894\nWe can rotate this pattern\nin six dimensions\n\n00:09:42.918 --> 00:09:44.438\nand see that it's quite pretty.\n\n00:09:47.158 --> 00:09:50.694\nRight now, this pattern\nmatches our best current knowledge\n\n00:09:50.718 --> 00:09:54.118\nof how nature is built at the tiny scales\nof these elementary particles.\n\n00:09:54.998 --> 00:09:56.614\nThis is what we know for certain.\n\n00:09:56.638 --> 00:09:58.774\nSome of these particles\nare at the very limit\n\n00:09:58.798 --> 00:10:01.174\nof what we've been able to reach\nwith experiments.\n\n00:10:01.198 --> 00:10:02.414\nFrom this pattern\n\n00:10:02.438 --> 00:10:05.774\nwe already know the particle physics\nof these tiny scales --\n\n00:10:05.798 --> 00:10:09.678\nthe way the universe works\nat these tiny scales is very beautiful.\n\n00:10:11.078 --> 00:10:13.494\nBut now I'm going to discuss\nsome new and old ideas\n\n00:10:13.518 --> 00:10:15.038\nabout things we don't know yet.\n\n00:10:15.638 --> 00:10:18.774\nWe want to expand this pattern\nusing mathematics alone,\n\n00:10:18.798 --> 00:10:21.414\nand see if we can get our hands\non the whole enchilada.\n\n00:10:21.438 --> 00:10:23.534\nWe want to find\nall the particles and forces\n\n00:10:23.558 --> 00:10:25.694\nthat make a complete picture\nof our universe.\n\n00:10:25.718 --> 00:10:28.374\nAnd we want to use this picture\nto predict new particles\n\n00:10:28.398 --> 00:10:30.922\nthat we'll see when experiments\nreach higher energies.\n\n00:10:32.878 --> 00:10:35.134\nSo there's an old idea in particle physics\n\n00:10:35.158 --> 00:10:37.894\nthat this known pattern of charges,\n\n00:10:37.918 --> 00:10:39.494\nwhich is not very symmetric,\n\n00:10:39.518 --> 00:10:42.374\ncould emerge from a more perfect pattern\nthat gets broken --\n\n00:10:42.398 --> 00:10:45.414\nsimilar to how the Higgs particle\nbreaks the electroweak pattern\n\n00:10:45.438 --> 00:10:47.094\nto give electromagnetism.\n\n00:10:47.118 --> 00:10:50.174\nIn order to do this,\nwe need to introduce new forces\n\n00:10:50.198 --> 00:10:51.518\nwith new charge directions.\n\n00:10:53.438 --> 00:10:55.134\nWhen we introduce a new direction,\n\n00:10:55.158 --> 00:10:58.574\nwe get to guess what charges\nthe particles have along this direction,\n\n00:10:58.598 --> 00:11:00.718\nand then we can rotate it\nin with the others.\n\n00:11:01.678 --> 00:11:05.174\nIf we guess wisely,\nwe can construct the standard charges\n\n00:11:05.198 --> 00:11:07.894\nin six charge dimensions\nas a broken symmetry\n\n00:11:07.918 --> 00:11:11.318\nof this more perfect pattern\nin seven charge dimensions.\n\n00:11:11.998 --> 00:11:14.974\nThis particular choice\ncorresponds to a grand unified theory\n\n00:11:14.998 --> 00:11:17.678\nintroduced by Pati and Salam in 1973.\n\n00:11:18.398 --> 00:11:21.134\nWhen we look at this new unified pattern,\n\n00:11:21.158 --> 00:11:24.118\nwe can see a couple of gaps\nwhere particles seem to be missing.\n\n00:11:25.038 --> 00:11:27.158\nThis is the way\ntheories of unification work.\n\n00:11:27.918 --> 00:11:30.454\nA physicist looks for larger,\nmore symmetric patterns\n\n00:11:30.478 --> 00:11:32.798\nthat include the established\npattern as a subset.\n\n00:11:33.638 --> 00:11:36.774\nThe larger pattern allows us\nto predict the existence of particles\n\n00:11:36.798 --> 00:11:38.038\nthat have never been seen.\n\n00:11:39.198 --> 00:11:41.454\nThis unification model\npredicts the existence\n\n00:11:41.478 --> 00:11:43.974\nof these two new force particles,\n\n00:11:43.998 --> 00:11:46.638\nwhich should act a lot\nlike the weak force, only weaker.\n\n00:11:48.118 --> 00:11:50.854\nNow, we can rotate this set\nof charges in seven dimensions\n\n00:11:50.878 --> 00:11:53.438\nand consider an odd fact\nabout the matter particles:\n\n00:11:54.558 --> 00:11:56.614\nthe second and third generations of matter\n\n00:11:56.638 --> 00:11:59.534\nhave exactly the same charges\nin six-dimensional charge space\n\n00:11:59.558 --> 00:12:00.798\nas the first generation.\n\n00:12:01.438 --> 00:12:04.518\nThese particles are not\nuniquely identified by their six charges.\n\n00:12:05.278 --> 00:12:08.118\nThey sit on top of one another\nin the standard charge space.\n\n00:12:09.358 --> 00:12:12.974\nHowever, if we work\nin eight-dimensional charge space,\n\n00:12:12.998 --> 00:12:16.598\nthen we can assign\nunique new charges to each particle.\n\n00:12:17.318 --> 00:12:19.718\nThen we can spin these in eight dimensions\n\n00:12:20.398 --> 00:12:22.398\nand see what the whole pattern looks like.\n\n00:12:23.941 --> 00:12:26.894\nHere we can see the second\nand third generations of matter now,\n\n00:12:26.918 --> 00:12:30.038\nrelated to the first generation\nby a symmetry called \"triality.\"\n\n00:12:31.478 --> 00:12:34.974\nThis particular pattern\nof charges in eight dimensions\n\n00:12:34.998 --> 00:12:38.518\nis actually part of the most beautiful\ngeometric structure in mathematics.\n\n00:12:39.718 --> 00:12:42.798\nIt's a pattern of the largest\nexceptional Lie group, E8.\n\n00:12:43.678 --> 00:12:47.694\nThis Lie group is a smooth,\ncurved shape with 248 dimensions.\n\n00:12:47.718 --> 00:12:50.694\nEach point in this pattern\ncorresponds to a symmetry\n\n00:12:50.718 --> 00:12:52.758\nof this very complex and beautiful shape.\n\n00:12:53.718 --> 00:12:56.494\nOne small part of this E8 shape\ncan be used to describe\n\n00:12:56.518 --> 00:12:59.134\nthe curved space-time\nof Einstein's general relativity,\n\n00:12:59.158 --> 00:13:00.398\nexplaining gravity.\n\n00:13:01.158 --> 00:13:02.854\nTogether with quantum mechanics,\n\n00:13:02.878 --> 00:13:05.334\nthe geometry of this shape\ncould describe everything\n\n00:13:05.358 --> 00:13:07.974\nabout how the universe works\nat the tiniest scales.\n\n00:13:07.998 --> 00:13:12.294\nThe pattern of this shape living\nin eight-dimensional charge space\n\n00:13:12.318 --> 00:13:13.598\nis exquisitely beautiful,\n\n00:13:14.998 --> 00:13:17.454\nand it summarizes thousands\nof possible interactions\n\n00:13:17.478 --> 00:13:19.174\nbetween these elementary particles,\n\n00:13:19.198 --> 00:13:21.838\neach of which is just a facet\nof this complicated shape.\n\n00:13:23.438 --> 00:13:26.374\nAs we spin it, we can see\nmany of the other intricate patterns\n\n00:13:26.398 --> 00:13:27.638\ncontained in this one.\n\n00:13:29.438 --> 00:13:31.214\nAnd with a particular rotation,\n\n00:13:31.238 --> 00:13:35.414\nwe can look down through this pattern\nin eight dimensions along a symmetry axis\n\n00:13:35.438 --> 00:13:37.254\nand see all the particles at once.\n\n00:13:37.278 --> 00:13:38.854\nIt's a very beautiful object,\n\n00:13:38.878 --> 00:13:41.254\nand as with any unification,\n\n00:13:41.278 --> 00:13:44.638\nwe can see some holes where new particles\nare required by this pattern.\n\n00:13:45.798 --> 00:13:48.534\nThere are 20 gaps\nwhere new particles should be,\n\n00:13:48.558 --> 00:13:51.294\ntwo of which have been filled\nby the Pati-Salam particles.\n\n00:13:51.318 --> 00:13:54.574\nFrom their location in this pattern,\nwe know that these new particles\n\n00:13:54.598 --> 00:13:56.934\nshould be scalar fields\nlike the Higgs particle,\n\n00:13:56.958 --> 00:13:59.638\nbut have color charge\nand interact with the strong force.\n\n00:14:00.198 --> 00:14:02.734\nFilling in these new particles\ncompletes this pattern,\n\n00:14:02.758 --> 00:14:04.094\ngiving us the full E8.\n\n00:14:04.118 --> 00:14:07.134\nThis E8 pattern has\nvery deep mathematical roots.\n\n00:14:07.158 --> 00:14:10.638\nIt's considered by many to be the most\nbeautiful structure in mathematics.\n\n00:14:11.238 --> 00:14:15.374\nIt's a fantastic prospect that this object\nof great mathematical beauty\n\n00:14:15.398 --> 00:14:17.734\ncould describe the truth\nof particle interactions\n\n00:14:17.758 --> 00:14:19.398\nat the smallest scales imaginable.\n\n00:14:21.678 --> 00:14:25.614\nAnd this idea that nature is described\nby mathematics is not at all new.\n\n00:14:25.638 --> 00:14:28.358\nIn 1623, Galileo wrote this:\n\n00:14:29.318 --> 00:14:33.014\n\"Nature's grand book,\nwhich stands continually open to our gaze,\n\n00:14:33.038 --> 00:14:35.534\nis written in the language of mathematics.\n\n00:14:35.558 --> 00:14:39.174\nIts characters are triangles,\ncircles and other geometrical figures,\n\n00:14:39.198 --> 00:14:43.054\nwithout which it is humanly impossible\nto understand a single word of it;\n\n00:14:43.078 --> 00:14:46.358\nwithout these, one is wandering around\nin a dark labyrinth.\"\n\n00:14:47.518 --> 00:14:48.758\nI believe this to be true,\n\n00:14:49.398 --> 00:14:51.414\nand I've tried\nto follow Galileo's guidance\n\n00:14:51.438 --> 00:14:53.774\nin describing the mathematics\nof particle physics\n\n00:14:53.798 --> 00:14:57.174\nusing only triangles, circles\nand other geometrical figures.\n\n00:14:57.198 --> 00:15:00.934\nOf course, when other physicists\nand I actually work on this stuff,\n\n00:15:00.958 --> 00:15:03.158\nthe mathematics\ncan resemble a dark labyrinth.\n\n00:15:04.878 --> 00:15:07.734\nBut it's reassuring that at the heart\nof this mathematics\n\n00:15:07.758 --> 00:15:09.678\nis pure, beautiful geometry.\n\n00:15:11.398 --> 00:15:12.854\nJoined with quantum mechanics,\n\n00:15:12.878 --> 00:15:16.814\nthis mathematics describes our universe\nas a growing E8 coral,\n\n00:15:16.838 --> 00:15:20.454\nwith particles interacting\nat every location in all possible ways\n\n00:15:20.478 --> 00:15:22.078\naccording to a beautiful pattern.\n\n00:15:23.518 --> 00:15:26.414\nAnd as more of the pattern\ncomes into view using new machines\n\n00:15:26.438 --> 00:15:28.254\nlike the Large Hadron Collider,\n\n00:15:28.278 --> 00:15:33.118\nwe may be able to see whether nature\nuses this E8 pattern or a different one.\n\n00:15:33.718 --> 00:15:36.958\nThis process of discovery is\na wonderful adventure to be involved in.\n\n00:15:37.638 --> 00:15:40.934\nIf the LHC finds particles\nthat fit this E8 pattern,\n\n00:15:40.958 --> 00:15:42.558\nthat will be very, very cool.\n\n00:15:43.918 --> 00:15:47.054\nIf the LHC finds new particles,\nbut they don't fit this pattern --\n\n00:15:47.078 --> 00:15:51.574\nwell, that will be very interesting,\nbut bad for this E8 theory.\n\n00:15:51.598 --> 00:15:54.094\nAnd, of course, bad for me personally.\n\n00:15:54.118 --> 00:15:56.294\n(Laughter)\n\n00:15:56.318 --> 00:15:58.094\nNow, how bad would that be?\n\n00:15:58.118 --> 00:16:00.214\nWell, pretty bad.\n\n00:16:00.238 --> 00:16:02.478\n(Laughter)\n\n00:16:03.358 --> 00:16:06.158\nBut predicting how nature works\nis a very risky game.\n\n00:16:07.158 --> 00:16:10.118\nThis theory and others like it\nare long shots.\n\n00:16:11.038 --> 00:16:13.894\nOne does a lot of hard work\nknowing that most of these ideas\n\n00:16:13.918 --> 00:16:16.094\nprobably won't end up\nbeing true about nature.\n\n00:16:16.118 --> 00:16:18.294\nThat's what doing\ntheoretical physics is like:\n\n00:16:18.318 --> 00:16:19.734\nthere are a lot of wipeouts.\n\n00:16:19.758 --> 00:16:23.118\nIn this regard, new physics theories\nare a lot like start-up companies.\n\n00:16:25.318 --> 00:16:26.734\nAs with any large investment,\n\n00:16:26.758 --> 00:16:29.654\nit can be emotionally difficult\nto abandon a line of research\n\n00:16:29.678 --> 00:16:30.974\nwhen it isn't working out.\n\n00:16:30.998 --> 00:16:33.054\nBut in science,\nif something isn't working,\n\n00:16:33.078 --> 00:16:35.278\nyou have to toss it out\nand try something else.\n\n00:16:36.118 --> 00:16:37.854\nNow, the only way to maintain sanity\n\n00:16:37.878 --> 00:16:40.494\nand achieve happiness\nin the midst of this uncertainty\n\n00:16:40.518 --> 00:16:42.558\nis to keep balance\nand perspective in life.\n\n00:16:44.398 --> 00:16:46.934\nI've tried the best I can\nto live a balanced life.\n\n00:16:46.958 --> 00:16:48.838\n(Laughter)\n\n00:16:49.518 --> 00:16:53.094\nI try to balance my life equally\nbetween physics, love and surfing --\n\n00:16:53.118 --> 00:16:54.934\nmy own three charge directions.\n\n00:16:54.958 --> 00:16:57.094\n(Laughter)\n\n00:16:57.118 --> 00:16:59.814\nThis way, even if the physics\nI work on comes to nothing,\n\n00:16:59.838 --> 00:17:01.558\nI still know I've lived a good life.\n\n00:17:02.198 --> 00:17:04.094\nAnd I try to live in beautiful places.\n\n00:17:04.118 --> 00:17:07.174\nFor most of the past ten years\nI've lived on the island of Maui,\n\n00:17:07.198 --> 00:17:08.438\na very beautiful place.\n\n00:17:08.798 --> 00:17:12.494\nNow, it's one of the greatest mysteries\nin the universe to my parents\n\n00:17:12.518 --> 00:17:14.374\nhow I managed to survive all that time\n\n00:17:14.398 --> 00:17:17.293\nwithout engaging in anything\nresembling full-time employment.\n\n00:17:17.317 --> 00:17:19.277\n(Laughter)\n\n00:17:20.918 --> 00:17:22.797\nI'm going to let you in on that secret.\n\n00:17:24.317 --> 00:17:26.478\nThis was a view\nfrom my home office on Maui.\n\n00:17:28.518 --> 00:17:29.718\nAnd this is another,\n\n00:17:31.678 --> 00:17:33.094\nand another.\n\n00:17:33.118 --> 00:17:36.134\nAnd you may have noticed\nthat these beautiful views are similar,\n\n00:17:36.158 --> 00:17:37.758\nbut in slightly different places.\n\n00:17:38.598 --> 00:17:42.014\nThat's because this used to be\nmy home and office on Maui.\n\n00:17:42.038 --> 00:17:43.814\n(Laughter)\n\n00:17:43.838 --> 00:17:45.478\nI've chosen a very unusual life.\n\n00:17:46.678 --> 00:17:48.014\nBut not worrying about rent\n\n00:17:48.038 --> 00:17:50.198\nallowed me to spend my time\ndoing what I love.\n\n00:17:50.918 --> 00:17:53.454\nLiving a nomadic existence\nhas been hard at times,\n\n00:17:53.478 --> 00:17:55.694\nbut it's allowed me\nto live in beautiful places\n\n00:17:55.718 --> 00:17:58.694\nand keep a balance in my life\nthat I've been happy with.\n\n00:17:58.718 --> 00:18:03.078\nIt allows me to spend a lot of my time\nhanging out with hyperintelligent coral.\n\n00:18:04.838 --> 00:18:07.974\nBut I also greatly enjoy\nthe company of hyperintelligent people.\n\n00:18:07.998 --> 00:18:10.379\nSo I'm very happy\nto have been invited here to TED.\n\n00:18:11.278 --> 00:18:12.494\nThank you very much.\n\n00:18:12.518 --> 00:18:19.134\n(Applause)\n\n00:18:19.158 --> 00:18:20.944\nChris Anderson: Stay here one second.\n\n00:18:20.968 --> 00:18:24.550\n(Applause)\n\n00:18:24.574 --> 00:18:26.574\nI probably understood two percent of that,\n\n00:18:26.598 --> 00:18:28.198\nbut I still absolutely loved it.\n\n00:18:30.198 --> 00:18:31.814\nSo I'm going to sound dumb.\n\n00:18:31.838 --> 00:18:34.174\nYour theory of everything --\n\n00:18:34.198 --> 00:18:35.774\nGarrett Lisi: I'm used to coral.\n\n00:18:35.798 --> 00:18:37.054\nCA: That's right.\n\n00:18:37.078 --> 00:18:39.414\nThe reason it's got\na few people at least excited\n\n00:18:39.438 --> 00:18:43.814\nis because, if you're right, it brings\ngravity and quantum theory together.\n\n00:18:43.838 --> 00:18:47.654\nSo are you saying that we should\nthink of the universe, at its heart --\n\n00:18:47.678 --> 00:18:50.374\nthat the smallest things that there are,\n\n00:18:50.398 --> 00:18:56.574\nare somehow an E8 object of possibility?\n\n00:18:56.598 --> 00:18:59.614\nI mean, is there a scale to it,\nat the smallest scale, or ...?\n\n00:18:59.638 --> 00:19:02.494\nGL: Well, right now\nthe pattern I showed you\n\n00:19:02.518 --> 00:19:07.134\nthat corresponds to what we know\nabout elementary particle physics --\n\n00:19:07.158 --> 00:19:09.574\nthat already corresponds\nto a very beautiful shape.\n\n00:19:09.598 --> 00:19:12.014\nAnd that's the one\nthat I said we knew for certain.\n\n00:19:12.038 --> 00:19:15.134\nAnd that shape\nhas remarkable similarities --\n\n00:19:15.158 --> 00:19:18.998\nand the way it fits into this E8 pattern,\nwhich could be the rest of the picture.\n\n00:19:20.078 --> 00:19:23.534\nAnd these patterns of points\nthat I've shown for you\n\n00:19:23.558 --> 00:19:27.374\nactually represent symmetries\nof this high-dimensional object\n\n00:19:27.398 --> 00:19:30.174\nthat would be warping\nand moving and dancing\n\n00:19:30.198 --> 00:19:32.294\nover the space-time that we experience.\n\n00:19:32.318 --> 00:19:35.974\nAnd that would be what explains all these\nelementary particles that we see.\n\n00:19:35.998 --> 00:19:39.374\nCA: But a string theorist,\nas I understand it,\n\n00:19:39.398 --> 00:19:42.414\nexplains electrons in terms\nof much smaller strings vibrating --\n\n00:19:42.438 --> 00:19:45.734\nI know, you don't like string theory --\nvibrating inside it.\n\n00:19:45.758 --> 00:19:50.574\nHow should we think\nof an electron in relation to E8?\n\n00:19:50.598 --> 00:19:53.998\nGL: Well, it would be one\nof the symmetries of this E8 shape.\n\n00:19:54.758 --> 00:20:00.134\nSo what's happening is, as the shape\nis moving over space-time, it's twisting.\n\n00:20:00.158 --> 00:20:04.614\nAnd the direction it's twisting\nas it moves is what particle we see.\n\n00:20:04.638 --> 00:20:05.854\nSo it would be --\n\n00:20:05.878 --> 00:20:09.054\nCA: The size of the E8 shape,\nhow does that relate to the electron?\n\n00:20:09.078 --> 00:20:12.294\nI feel like I need that for my picture.\nIs it bigger? Is it smaller?\n\n00:20:12.318 --> 00:20:14.795\nGL: As far as we know,\nelectrons are point particles,\n\n00:20:14.819 --> 00:20:17.654\nso this would be going down\nto the smallest possible scales.\n\n00:20:17.678 --> 00:20:21.494\nSo the way these things are explained\nin quantum field theory is,\n\n00:20:21.518 --> 00:20:24.174\nall possibilities are expanding\nand developing at once.\n\n00:20:24.198 --> 00:20:26.238\nAnd this is why\nI use the analogy to coral.\n\n00:20:27.158 --> 00:20:28.358\nAnd --\n\n00:20:29.558 --> 00:20:33.854\nin this way, the way that E8 comes in\n\n00:20:33.878 --> 00:20:38.318\nis it will be as a shape that's attached\nat each point in the space-time.\n\n00:20:39.238 --> 00:20:42.694\nAnd, as I said,\nthe way the shape twists --\n\n00:20:42.718 --> 00:20:45.214\nthe directional along which way\nthe shape is twisting\n\n00:20:45.238 --> 00:20:47.294\nas it moves over this curved surface --\n\n00:20:47.318 --> 00:20:50.094\nis what the elementary particles\nare, themselves.\n\n00:20:50.118 --> 00:20:52.774\nSo through quantum field theory,\n\n00:20:52.798 --> 00:20:56.014\nthey manifest themselves as points\nand interact that way.\n\n00:20:56.038 --> 00:20:58.574\nI don't know if I'll be able\nto make this any clearer.\n\n00:20:58.598 --> 00:21:01.534\n(Laughter)\n\n00:21:01.558 --> 00:21:02.974\nCA: It doesn't really matter.\n\n00:21:02.998 --> 00:21:05.014\nIt's evoking a kind of sense of wonder,\n\n00:21:05.038 --> 00:21:09.814\nand I certainly\nwant to understand more of this.\n\n00:21:09.838 --> 00:21:12.974\nBut thank you so much for coming.\nThat was absolutely fascinating.\n\n00:21:12.998 --> 00:21:14.838\n(Applause)"}, {"title": "Design and the Elastic Mind", "duration": "1060", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/paola_antonelli_previews_design_and_the_elastic_mind", "transcript": "I dabble in design. I'm a curator of architecture and design; I happen to be at the Museum of Modern Art. But what we're going to talk about today is really design. Really good designers are like sponges: they really are curious and absorb every kind of information that comes their way, and transform it so that it can be used by people like us. And so that gives me an opportunity, because every design show that I curate kind of looks at a different world. And it's great, because it seems like every time I change jobs.And what I'm going to do today is I'm going to give you a preview of the next exhibition that I'm working on, which is called \"Design and the Elastic Mind.\" The world that I decided to focus on this particular time is the world of science and the world of technology. Technology always comes into play when design is involved, but science does a little less. But designers are great at taking big revolutions that happen and transforming them so that we can use them. And this is what this exhibition looks at.If you think about your life today, you go every day through many different scales, many different changes of rhythm and pace. You work over different time zones, you talk to very different people, you multitask. We all know it, and we do it kind of automatically. Some of the minds in this audience are super elastic, others are a little slower, others have a few stretch marks, but nonetheless this is a quite exceptional audience from that viewpoint. Other people are not as elastic. I can't get my father in Italy to work on the Internet. He doesn't want to put high-speed Internet at home. And that's because there's some little bit of fear, little bit of resistance or just clogged mechanisms. So designers work on this particular malaise that we have, these kinds of discomforts that we have, and try to make life easier for us. Elasticity of mind is something that we really need, you know, we really need, we really cherish and we really work on. And this exhibition is about the work of designers that help us be more elastic, and also of designers that really work on this elasticity as an opportunity. And one last thing is that it's not only designers, but it's also scientists.And before I launch into the display of some of the slides and into the preview, I would like to point out this beautiful detail about scientists and design. You can say that the relationship between science and design goes back centuries. You can of course talk about Leonardo da Vinci and many other Renaissance men and women \u2014 and there's a gigantic history behind it. But according to a really great science historian you might know, Peter Galison \u2014 he teaches at Harvard \u2014 what nanotechnology in particular and quantum physics have brought to designers is this renewed interest, this real passion for design.So basically, the idea of being able to build things bottom up, atom by atom, has made them all into tinkerers. And all of a sudden scientists are seeking designers, just like designers are seeking scientists. It's a brand-new love affair that we're trying to cultivate at MOMA. Together with Adam Bly, who is the founder of Seed magazine \u2014 that's now a multimedia company, you might know it \u2014 we founded about a year ago a monthly salon for designers and scientists, and it's quite beautiful. And Keith has come, and also Jonathan has come and many others. And it was great, because at the beginning was this apology fest \u2014 you know, scientists would tell designers, you know, I don't know what style is, I'm not really elegant. And designers would like, oh, I don't know how to do an equation, I don't understand what you're saying. And then all of a sudden they really started talking each others' language, and now we're already at the point that they collaborate.Paul Steinhardt, a physicist from New York, and Aranda/Lasch, architects, collaborated in an installation in London at the Serpentine. And it's really interesting to see how this happens. The exhibition will talk about the work of both designers and scientists, and show how they're presenting the possibilities of the future to us. I'm showing to you different sections of the show right now, just to give you a taste of it. Nanophysics and nanotechnology, for instance, have really opened the designer's mind. In this case I'm showing more the designers' work, because they're the ones that have really been stimulated. A lot of the objects in the show are concepts, not objects that exist already. But what you're looking at here is the work of some scientists from UCLA. This kind of alphabet soup is a new way to mark proteins \u2014 not only by color but literally by alphabet letters. So they construct it, and they can construct all kinds of formsat the nanoscale. This is the work of design students from the Royal College of Arts in London that have been working together with their tutor, Tony Dunne, and with a bunch of scientists around Great Britain on the possibilities of nanotechnology for design in the future. New sensing elements on the body \u2014 you can grow hairs on your nails, and therefore grab some of the particles from another person. They seem very, very obsessed with finding out more about the ideal mate. So they're working on enhancing everything: touch, smell \u2014 everything they can, in order to find the perfect mate.Very interesting. This is a typeface designer from Israel who has designed \u2014 he calls them \"typosperma.\" He's thinking \u2014 of course it's all a concept \u2014 of injecting typefaces into spermatozoa, I don't know how to say it in English \u2014 spermatazoi \u2014 in order to make them become \u2014 to almost have a song or a whole poem written with every ejaculation. (Laughter) I tell you, designers are quite fantastic, you know.So, tissue design. In this case too, you have a mixture of scientists and designers. This here is part of the same lab at the Royal College of Arts. The RCA is really quite an amazing school from that viewpoint. One of the assignments for a year was to work with in-vitro meat. You know that already you can grow meat in vitro. In Australia they did it \u2014 this research company, called SymbioticA. But the problem is that it's a really ugly patty. And so, the assignment to the students was, how should the steak of tomorrow be? When you don't have to kill cows and it can have any shape, what should it be like? So this particular student, James King, went around the beautiful English countryside, picked the best, best cow that he could see, and then put her in the MRI machine. Then, he took the scans of the best organs and made the meat \u2014 of course, this is done with a Japanese resins food maker, but you know, in the future it could be made better \u2014 which reproduces the best MRI scan of the best cow he could find.Instead, this element here is much more banal. Something that you know can be done already is to grow bone tissue, so that you can make a wedding ring out of the bone tissue of your loved one \u2014 literally. So, this is indeed made of human bone tissue.This is SymbioticA, and they've been working \u2014 they were the first ones to do this in-vitro meat \u2014 and now they've also done an in-vitro coat, a leather coat. It's miniscule, but it's a real coat. It's shaped like one. So, we'll be able to really not have any excuse to be wearing everything leather in the future.One of the most important topics of the show \u2014 you know, as anything in our life today, we can look at it from many, many different viewpoints, and at different levels. One of the most interesting and most important concepts is the idea of scale. We change scale very often: we change resolution of screens, and we're not really fazed by it, we do it very comfortably. So you go, even in the exhibition, from the idea of nanotechnology and the nanoscale to the manipulation of really great amounts of data \u2014 the mapping and tagging of the universe and of the world. In this particular case a section will be devoted to information design. You see here the work of Ben Fry. This is \"Human vs. Chimps\" \u2014 the few chromosomes that distinguish us from chimps. It was a beautiful visualization that he did for Seed magazine. And here's the whole code of Pac-Man, visualized with all the go-to, go-back-to, also made into a beautiful choreography.And then also graphs by scientists, this beautiful diagraph of protein homology. Scientists are starting to also consider aesthetics. We were discussing with Keith Shrubb* this morning the fact that many scientists tend not to use anything beautiful in their presentations, otherwise they're afraid of being considered dumb blondes. So they pick the worst background from any kind of PowerPoint presentation, the worst typeface. It's only recently that this kind of marriage between design and science is producing some of the first \"pretty\" \u2014 if we can say so \u2014 scientific presentations. Another aspect of contemporary design that I think is mind-opening, promising and will really be the future of design, is the idea of collective design. You know, the whole XO laptop, from One Laptop per Child, is based on the idea of collaboration and mash and networking. So, the more the merrier. The more computers, the stronger the signal, and children work on the interface so that it's all based on doing things together, tasks together. So the idea of collective design is something that will become even bigger in the future, and this is chosen as an example.Related to the idea of collective design and to the new balance between the individual and the collectiveness, collectivity is the idea of existence maximum. That's a term that I coined a few years ago while I was thinking of how pressed we are together, and at the same time how these small objects, like the Walkman first and then the iPod, create bubbles of space around us that enable us to have a metaphysical space that is much bigger than our physical space. You can be in the subway and you can be completely isolated and have your own room in your iPod.And this is the work of several designers that really enhance the idea of solitude and expansion by means of various techniques. This is a spa telephone. The idea is that it's become so difficult to have a private conversation anywhere that you go to the spa, you have a massage, you have a facial, maybe a rub, and then you have this beautiful pool with this perfect temperature, and you can have this isolation tank phone conversation with whomever you've been wanting to talk with for a long time. And same thing here, Social Tele-presence. It's actually already used by the military a little bit, but it's the idea of being able to be somewhere else with your senses while you're removed from it physically. And this is called Blind Date. It's a [unclear], so if you're too shy to be really at the date, you can stay at a distance with your flowers and somebody else reenacts the date for you.Rapid manufacturing is another big area in which technology and design are, I think, bound to change the world. You've heard about it before many times. Rapid manufacturing is a computer file sent directly from the computer to the manufacturing machine. It used to be called rapid prototyping, rapid modeling. It started out in the '80s, but at the beginning it was machines carving out of a foam block a model that was very, very fragile, and could not have any real use. Slowly but surely, the materials became better \u2014 better resins. Techniques became better \u2014 not only carving but also stereolithography and laser \u2014 solidifying all kinds of resins, whether in powder or in liquid form. And the vats became bigger, to the point that now we can have actual chairs made by rapid manufacturing. It takes seven days today to manufacture a chair, but you know what? One day it will take seven hours. And then the dream is that you'll be able to, from home, customize your chair. You know, companies and designers will be designing the matrix or the margins that respect both solidity and brand, and design identity. And then you can send it to the Kinko's store at the cornerand go get your chair. Now, the implications of this are enormous, not only regarding the participation of the final buyer in the design process, but also no tracking, no warehousing, no wasted materials. Also, I can imagine many design manufacturers will have to retool their own business plans and maybe invest in this Kinko's store. But it really is a big change. And here I'm showing a picture that was in Wired Magazine \u2014 you know, the Artifacts of the Future section that I love so much \u2014 that shows you can have your desktop 3D printer and print your own basketball. But here instead are examples, you can already 3D-print textiles, which is very interesting. This is just a really nice touch \u2014 it's called slow prototyping. It's a designer that put 10,000 bees at work and they built this vase. They had a particular shape that they had to stay in.Mapping and tagging. As the capacity of computers becomes really, really big, and the capacity of our mind not that much bigger, we find that we need to tag as much as we can what we do in order to then retrace our path. Also, we do it in order to share with other people. Again, this communal sense of experience that seems to be so important today. So, various ways to map and tag are also the work of many designers nowadays. Also, the senses \u2014 designers and scientists all work on trying to expand our senses capabilities so that we can achieve more. And also animal senses in a way.This particular object that many people love so much is actually based on kind of a scientific experiment \u2014 the fact that bees have a very strong olfactory sense, and so \u2014 much like dogs that can smell certain kinds of skin cancer \u2014 bees can be trained by Pavlovian reflex to detect one type of cancer, and also pregnancy. And so this student at the RCA designed this beautiful blown-glass object where the bees move from one chamber to the other if they detect that particular smell that signifies, in this case, pregnancy. Another shape is made for cancer.Design for Debate is a very interesting new endeavor that designers have really shaped for themselves. Some designers don't design objects, products, things that we're going to actually use, but rather, they design scenarios that are object-based. They're still very useful. They help companies and other designers think better about the future. And usually they are accompanied by videos. This is quite beautiful. It's Dunne and Raby, \"All the Robots.\" Those are a series of robots that are meant to be taken care of. We always think that robots will take care of us, and instead they designed these robots that are very, very needy. You need to take one in your arms and look at it in the eyes for about five minutes before it does something. Another one gets really, really nervous if you get in to the room, and starts shaking, so you have to calm it down. So it's really a way to make us think more about what robots mean to us. Noam Toran and \"Accessories for Lonely Men\": the idea is that when you lose your loved one or you go through a bad breakup, what you miss the most are those annoying things that you used to hate when you were with the other person. So he designed all these series of accessories. This one is something that takes away the sheets from you at night. Then there's another one that breathes on your neck. There's another one that throws plates and breaks them. So it's just this idea of what we really miss in life.Elio Caccavale: he took the idea of those dolls that explain leukemia. He's working on dolls that explain xenotransplantation, and also the spider gene into the goat, from a few years ago. He's working for the exhibition on a whole series of dolls that explain to children where babies come from today. Because it's not anymore Mom, Dad, the flowers and the bees, and then there's the baby. No, it can be two moms, three dads, in-vitro \u2014 there's the whole idea of how babies can be made today that has changed. So it's a series of dolls that he's working on right now.One of the most beautiful things is that designers really work on life, even though they take technology into account. And many designers have been working recently on the idea of death and mourning, and what we can do about it today with new technologies. Or how we should behave about it with new technologies. These three objects over there are hard drives with a Bluetooth connection. But they're in reality very, very beautiful sculpted artifacts that contain the whole desktop and computer memory of somebody who passed away. So instead of having only the pictures, you will be able to put this object next to the computer and all of a sudden have, you know, Gertrude's whole life and all of her files and her address book come alive.And this is even better. This is Auger-Loizeau, \"AfterLife.\" It's the idea that some people don't believe in an afterlife. So to give them something tangible that shows that there is something after death, they take the gastric juices of people who passed away and concentrate them, and put them into a battery that can actually be used to power flashlights. They also go \u2014 you know, sex toys, whatever. It's quite amazing how these things can make you smile, can make you laugh, can make you cry sometimes. But I'm hoping that this particular exhibition will be able to trace a new portrait of where design is going \u2014 which is always, hopefully, a portrait a few years in advance of where the world is going. Thank you very much.", "id": 372, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:11.958 --> 00:00:14.958\nI dabble in design. I'm a curator of architecture and design;\n\n00:00:14.958 --> 00:00:16.958\nI happen to be at the Museum of Modern Art.\n\n00:00:16.958 --> 00:00:19.958\nBut what we're going to talk about today\n\n00:00:19.958 --> 00:00:22.958\nis really design. Really good designers are like sponges:\n\n00:00:22.958 --> 00:00:24.958\nthey really are curious\n\n00:00:24.958 --> 00:00:27.958\nand absorb every kind of information that comes their way,\n\n00:00:28.958 --> 00:00:31.958\nand transform it so that it can be used by people like us.\n\n00:00:31.958 --> 00:00:33.958\nAnd so that gives me an opportunity,\n\n00:00:33.958 --> 00:00:35.958\nbecause every design show that I curate\n\n00:00:36.958 --> 00:00:38.958\nkind of looks at a different world. And it's great,\n\n00:00:38.958 --> 00:00:41.958\nbecause it seems like every time I change jobs.\n\n00:00:42.958 --> 00:00:44.958\nAnd what I'm going to do today is I'm going to give you a preview\n\n00:00:44.958 --> 00:00:47.958\nof the next exhibition that I'm working on, which is called\n\n00:00:47.958 --> 00:00:48.958\n\"Design and the Elastic Mind.\"\n\n00:00:49.958 --> 00:00:53.958\nThe world that I decided to focus on this particular time\n\n00:00:53.958 --> 00:00:56.958\nis the world of science and the world of technology.\n\n00:00:56.958 --> 00:00:59.958\nTechnology always comes into play when design is involved,\n\n00:00:59.958 --> 00:01:01.958\nbut science does a little less.\n\n00:01:01.958 --> 00:01:05.958\nBut designers are great at taking big revolutions that happen\n\n00:01:05.958 --> 00:01:08.958\nand transforming them so that we can use them.\n\n00:01:08.958 --> 00:01:11.958\nAnd this is what this exhibition looks at.\n\n00:01:12.958 --> 00:01:14.958\nIf you think about your life today,\n\n00:01:14.958 --> 00:01:17.958\nyou go every day through many different scales,\n\n00:01:17.958 --> 00:01:19.958\nmany different changes of rhythm and pace.\n\n00:01:19.958 --> 00:01:23.958\nYou work over different time zones, you talk to very different people,\n\n00:01:23.958 --> 00:01:27.958\nyou multitask. We all know it, and we do it kind of automatically.\n\n00:01:27.958 --> 00:01:30.958\nSome of the minds in this audience are super elastic,\n\n00:01:30.958 --> 00:01:32.958\nothers are a little slower,\n\n00:01:32.958 --> 00:01:35.958\nothers have a few stretch marks, but nonetheless\n\n00:01:35.958 --> 00:01:39.958\nthis is a quite exceptional audience from that viewpoint.\n\n00:01:39.958 --> 00:01:41.958\nOther people are not as elastic.\n\n00:01:41.958 --> 00:01:44.958\nI can't get my father in Italy to work on the Internet.\n\n00:01:44.958 --> 00:01:46.958\nHe doesn't want to put high-speed Internet at home.\n\n00:01:46.958 --> 00:01:49.958\nAnd that's because there's some little bit of fear,\n\n00:01:49.958 --> 00:01:52.958\nlittle bit of resistance or just clogged mechanisms.\n\n00:01:52.958 --> 00:01:56.958\nSo designers work on this particular malaise that we have,\n\n00:01:56.958 --> 00:01:59.958\nthese kinds of discomforts that we have,\n\n00:01:59.958 --> 00:02:01.958\nand try to make life easier for us.\n\n00:02:01.958 --> 00:02:05.958\nElasticity of mind is something that we really need, you know,\n\n00:02:05.958 --> 00:02:08.958\nwe really need, we really cherish and we really work on.\n\n00:02:09.958 --> 00:02:12.958\nAnd this exhibition is about the work of designers\n\n00:02:12.958 --> 00:02:14.958\nthat help us be more elastic,\n\n00:02:14.958 --> 00:02:18.958\nand also of designers that really work on this elasticity\n\n00:02:18.958 --> 00:02:20.958\nas an opportunity. And one last thing is that\n\n00:02:21.958 --> 00:02:23.958\nit's not only designers, but it's also scientists.\n\n00:02:23.958 --> 00:02:28.958\nAnd before I launch into the display of some of the slides\n\n00:02:28.958 --> 00:02:30.958\nand into the preview, I would like to point out\n\n00:02:30.958 --> 00:02:34.958\nthis beautiful detail about scientists and design.\n\n00:02:34.958 --> 00:02:36.958\nYou can say that the relationship between science and design\n\n00:02:37.958 --> 00:02:39.958\ngoes back centuries. You can of course talk about\n\n00:02:39.958 --> 00:02:43.958\nLeonardo da Vinci and many other Renaissance men and women --\n\n00:02:43.958 --> 00:02:45.958\nand there's a gigantic history behind it.\n\n00:02:46.958 --> 00:02:50.958\nBut according to a really great science historian you might know,\n\n00:02:50.958 --> 00:02:52.958\nPeter Galison -- he teaches at Harvard --\n\n00:02:52.958 --> 00:02:56.958\nwhat nanotechnology in particular and quantum physics\n\n00:02:56.958 --> 00:02:59.958\nhave brought to designers is this renewed interest,\n\n00:02:59.958 --> 00:03:01.958\nthis real passion for design.\n\n00:03:02.958 --> 00:03:05.958\nSo basically, the idea of being able to build things bottom up,\n\n00:03:06.958 --> 00:03:09.958\natom by atom, has made them all into tinkerers.\n\n00:03:09.958 --> 00:03:12.958\nAnd all of a sudden scientists are seeking designers,\n\n00:03:12.958 --> 00:03:14.958\njust like designers are seeking scientists.\n\n00:03:15.958 --> 00:03:19.958\nIt's a brand-new love affair that we're trying to cultivate\n\n00:03:20.958 --> 00:03:24.958\nat MOMA. Together with Adam Bly, who is the founder of Seed magazine --\n\n00:03:24.958 --> 00:03:26.958\nthat's now a multimedia company, you might know it --\n\n00:03:26.958 --> 00:03:30.958\nwe founded about a year ago a monthly salon\n\n00:03:31.958 --> 00:03:33.958\nfor designers and scientists, and it's quite beautiful.\n\n00:03:33.958 --> 00:03:36.958\nAnd Keith has come, and also Jonathan has come and many others.\n\n00:03:36.958 --> 00:03:39.958\nAnd it was great, because at the beginning was this apology fest --\n\n00:03:39.958 --> 00:03:41.958\nyou know, scientists would tell designers,\n\n00:03:41.958 --> 00:03:44.958\nyou know, I don't know what style is, I'm not really elegant.\n\n00:03:44.958 --> 00:03:47.958\nAnd designers would like, oh, I don't know how to do an equation,\n\n00:03:47.958 --> 00:03:50.958\nI don't understand what you're saying. And then all of a sudden\n\n00:03:50.958 --> 00:03:52.958\nthey really started talking each others' language,\n\n00:03:52.958 --> 00:03:54.958\nand now we're already at the point that they collaborate.\n\n00:03:54.958 --> 00:03:57.958\nPaul Steinhardt, a physicist from New York,\n\n00:03:57.958 --> 00:04:01.958\nand Aranda/Lasch, architects, collaborated in an installation\n\n00:04:02.958 --> 00:04:03.958\nin London at the Serpentine.\n\n00:04:04.958 --> 00:04:07.958\nAnd it's really interesting to see how this happens.\n\n00:04:08.958 --> 00:04:11.958\nThe exhibition will talk about the work\n\n00:04:11.958 --> 00:04:13.958\nof both designers and scientists,\n\n00:04:13.958 --> 00:04:17.958\nand show how they're presenting the possibilities of the future to us.\n\n00:04:17.958 --> 00:04:18.958\nI'm showing to you\n\n00:04:18.958 --> 00:04:20.958\ndifferent sections of the show right now,\n\n00:04:20.958 --> 00:04:21.958\njust to give you a taste of it.\n\n00:04:21.958 --> 00:04:24.958\nNanophysics and nanotechnology, for instance,\n\n00:04:25.958 --> 00:04:27.958\nhave really opened the designer's mind.\n\n00:04:27.958 --> 00:04:29.958\nIn this case I'm showing more the designers' work,\n\n00:04:29.958 --> 00:04:32.958\nbecause they're the ones that have really been stimulated.\n\n00:04:32.958 --> 00:04:34.958\nA lot of the objects in the show are concepts,\n\n00:04:34.958 --> 00:04:38.958\nnot objects that exist already. But what you're looking at here\n\n00:04:39.958 --> 00:04:42.958\nis the work of some scientists from UCLA.\n\n00:04:42.958 --> 00:04:45.958\nThis kind of alphabet soup is a new way to mark proteins --\n\n00:04:45.958 --> 00:04:48.958\nnot only by color but literally by alphabet letters.\n\n00:04:48.958 --> 00:04:51.958\nSo they construct it, and they can construct all kinds of forms\n\n00:04:51.958 --> 00:04:54.958\nat the nanoscale. This is the work of design students\n\n00:04:54.958 --> 00:04:56.958\nfrom the Royal College of Arts in London\n\n00:04:56.958 --> 00:04:59.958\nthat have been working together with their tutor, Tony Dunne,\n\n00:04:59.958 --> 00:05:01.958\nand with a bunch of scientists around Great Britain\n\n00:05:02.958 --> 00:05:05.958\non the possibilities of nanotechnology for design in the future.\n\n00:05:05.958 --> 00:05:07.958\nNew sensing elements on the body --\n\n00:05:07.958 --> 00:05:09.958\nyou can grow hairs on your nails,\n\n00:05:09.958 --> 00:05:12.958\nand therefore grab some of the particles from another person.\n\n00:05:12.958 --> 00:05:13.958\nThey seem very, very obsessed\n\n00:05:14.958 --> 00:05:16.958\nwith finding out more about the ideal mate.\n\n00:05:16.958 --> 00:05:20.958\nSo they're working on enhancing everything: touch, smell --\n\n00:05:20.958 --> 00:05:23.958\neverything they can, in order to find the perfect mate.\n\n00:05:23.958 --> 00:05:26.958\nVery interesting. This is a typeface designer\n\n00:05:26.958 --> 00:05:30.958\nfrom Israel who has designed -- he calls them \"typosperma.\"\n\n00:05:30.958 --> 00:05:32.958\nHe's thinking -- of course it's all a concept --\n\n00:05:33.958 --> 00:05:37.958\nof injecting typefaces into spermatozoa,\n\n00:05:37.958 --> 00:05:40.958\nI don't know how to say it in English -- spermatazoi --\n\n00:05:40.958 --> 00:05:44.958\nin order to make them become -- to almost have a song\n\n00:05:44.958 --> 00:05:51.958\nor a whole poem written with every ejaculation. (Laughter)\n\n00:05:51.958 --> 00:05:53.958\nI tell you, designers are quite fantastic, you know.\n\n00:05:53.958 --> 00:05:55.958\nSo, tissue design.\n\n00:05:55.958 --> 00:05:58.958\nIn this case too, you have a mixture of scientists and designers.\n\n00:05:59.958 --> 00:06:03.958\nThis here is part of the same lab at the Royal College of Arts.\n\n00:06:03.958 --> 00:06:06.958\nThe RCA is really quite an amazing school from that viewpoint.\n\n00:06:06.958 --> 00:06:09.958\nOne of the assignments for a year was to work with in-vitro meat.\n\n00:06:09.958 --> 00:06:12.958\nYou know that already you can grow meat in vitro.\n\n00:06:12.958 --> 00:06:15.958\nIn Australia they did it -- this research company, called SymbioticA.\n\n00:06:15.958 --> 00:06:19.958\nBut the problem is that it's a really ugly patty.\n\n00:06:19.958 --> 00:06:21.958\nAnd so, the assignment to the students was,\n\n00:06:21.958 --> 00:06:23.958\nhow should the steak of tomorrow be?\n\n00:06:23.958 --> 00:06:26.958\nWhen you don't have to kill cows and it can have any shape,\n\n00:06:26.958 --> 00:06:27.958\nwhat should it be like?\n\n00:06:27.958 --> 00:06:29.958\nSo this particular student, James King,\n\n00:06:30.958 --> 00:06:32.958\nwent around the beautiful English countryside,\n\n00:06:32.958 --> 00:06:34.958\npicked the best, best cow that he could see,\n\n00:06:35.958 --> 00:06:37.958\nand then put her in the MRI machine.\n\n00:06:37.958 --> 00:06:41.958\nThen, he took the scans of the best organs and made the meat --\n\n00:06:41.958 --> 00:06:44.958\nof course, this is done with a Japanese resins food maker,\n\n00:06:44.958 --> 00:06:47.958\nbut you know, in the future it could be made better --\n\n00:06:47.958 --> 00:06:50.958\nwhich reproduces the best MRI scan of the best cow he could find.\n\n00:06:51.958 --> 00:06:55.958\nInstead, this element here is much more banal.\n\n00:06:55.958 --> 00:06:57.958\nSomething that you know can be done already\n\n00:06:57.958 --> 00:07:01.958\nis to grow bone tissue, so that you can make a wedding ring\n\n00:07:01.958 --> 00:07:03.958\nout of the bone tissue of your loved one -- literally.\n\n00:07:03.958 --> 00:07:07.958\nSo, this is indeed made of human bone tissue.\n\n00:07:07.958 --> 00:07:10.958\nThis is SymbioticA, and they've been working --\n\n00:07:10.958 --> 00:07:12.958\nthey were the first ones to do this in-vitro meat --\n\n00:07:12.958 --> 00:07:15.958\nand now they've also done an in-vitro coat, a leather coat.\n\n00:07:15.958 --> 00:07:19.958\nIt's miniscule, but it's a real coat. It's shaped like one.\n\n00:07:19.958 --> 00:07:22.958\nSo, we'll be able to really not have any excuse\n\n00:07:22.958 --> 00:07:25.958\nto be wearing everything leather in the future.\n\n00:07:25.958 --> 00:07:28.958\nOne of the most important topics of the show -- you know,\n\n00:07:28.958 --> 00:07:30.958\nas anything in our life today,\n\n00:07:30.958 --> 00:07:32.958\nwe can look at it from many, many different viewpoints,\n\n00:07:32.958 --> 00:07:33.958\nand at different levels.\n\n00:07:33.958 --> 00:07:36.958\nOne of the most interesting and most important concepts\n\n00:07:36.958 --> 00:07:39.958\nis the idea of scale. We change scale very often:\n\n00:07:39.958 --> 00:07:41.958\nwe change resolution of screens, and\n\n00:07:41.958 --> 00:07:44.958\nwe're not really fazed by it, we do it very comfortably.\n\n00:07:45.958 --> 00:07:47.958\nSo you go, even in the exhibition,\n\n00:07:47.958 --> 00:07:49.958\nfrom the idea of nanotechnology and the nanoscale\n\n00:07:49.958 --> 00:07:52.958\nto the manipulation of really great amounts of data --\n\n00:07:52.958 --> 00:07:55.958\nthe mapping and tagging of the universe and of the world.\n\n00:07:55.958 --> 00:07:58.958\nIn this particular case a section will be devoted\n\n00:07:58.958 --> 00:07:59.958\nto information design.\n\n00:07:59.958 --> 00:08:03.958\nYou see here the work of Ben Fry. This is \"Human vs. Chimps\" --\n\n00:08:03.958 --> 00:08:06.958\nthe few chromosomes that distinguish us from chimps.\n\n00:08:06.958 --> 00:08:09.958\nIt was a beautiful visualization that he did for Seed magazine.\n\n00:08:10.958 --> 00:08:13.958\nAnd here's the whole code of Pac-Man, visualized\n\n00:08:13.958 --> 00:08:14.958\nwith all the go-to, go-back-to,\n\n00:08:15.958 --> 00:08:17.958\nalso made into a beautiful choreography.\n\n00:08:18.958 --> 00:08:20.958\nAnd then also graphs by scientists,\n\n00:08:20.958 --> 00:08:23.958\nthis beautiful diagraph of protein homology.\n\n00:08:23.958 --> 00:08:25.958\nScientists are starting to also consider aesthetics.\n\n00:08:25.958 --> 00:08:27.958\nWe were discussing with Keith Shrubb* this morning\n\n00:08:28.958 --> 00:08:30.958\nthe fact that many scientists\n\n00:08:30.958 --> 00:08:33.958\ntend not to use anything beautiful in their presentations,\n\n00:08:33.958 --> 00:08:36.958\notherwise they're afraid of being considered dumb blondes.\n\n00:08:36.958 --> 00:08:38.958\nSo they pick the worst background\n\n00:08:38.958 --> 00:08:42.958\nfrom any kind of PowerPoint presentation, the worst typeface.\n\n00:08:42.958 --> 00:08:45.958\nIt's only recently that this kind of marriage\n\n00:08:45.958 --> 00:08:49.958\nbetween design and science is producing some of the first \"pretty\" --\n\n00:08:49.958 --> 00:08:52.958\nif we can say so -- scientific presentations.\n\n00:08:52.958 --> 00:08:54.958\nAnother aspect of contemporary design\n\n00:08:54.958 --> 00:08:57.958\nthat I think is mind-opening, promising\n\n00:08:57.958 --> 00:08:58.958\nand will really be the future of design,\n\n00:08:58.958 --> 00:09:00.958\nis the idea of collective design.\n\n00:09:00.958 --> 00:09:04.958\nYou know, the whole XO laptop, from One Laptop per Child,\n\n00:09:04.958 --> 00:09:08.958\nis based on the idea of collaboration and mash and networking.\n\n00:09:08.958 --> 00:09:10.958\nSo, the more the merrier.\n\n00:09:10.958 --> 00:09:12.958\nThe more computers, the stronger the signal,\n\n00:09:12.958 --> 00:09:16.958\nand children work on the interface so that it's all based\n\n00:09:16.958 --> 00:09:19.958\non doing things together, tasks together.\n\n00:09:19.958 --> 00:09:22.958\nSo the idea of collective design\n\n00:09:22.958 --> 00:09:24.958\nis something that will become even bigger in the future,\n\n00:09:24.958 --> 00:09:26.958\nand this is chosen as an example.\n\n00:09:28.958 --> 00:09:31.958\nRelated to the idea of collective design and to the new balance\n\n00:09:31.958 --> 00:09:35.958\nbetween the individual and the collectiveness, collectivity\n\n00:09:35.958 --> 00:09:37.958\nis the idea of existence maximum.\n\n00:09:37.958 --> 00:09:39.958\nThat's a term that I coined a few years ago\n\n00:09:39.958 --> 00:09:42.958\nwhile I was thinking of how pressed we are together,\n\n00:09:42.958 --> 00:09:45.958\nand at the same time how these small objects,\n\n00:09:46.958 --> 00:09:48.958\nlike the Walkman first and then the iPod,\n\n00:09:48.958 --> 00:09:51.958\ncreate bubbles of space around us that enable us\n\n00:09:51.958 --> 00:09:53.958\nto have a metaphysical space\n\n00:09:53.958 --> 00:09:55.958\nthat is much bigger than our physical space.\n\n00:09:55.958 --> 00:09:59.958\nYou can be in the subway and you can be completely isolated\n\n00:09:59.958 --> 00:10:01.958\nand have your own room in your iPod.\n\n00:10:01.958 --> 00:10:03.958\nAnd this is the work of several designers\n\n00:10:04.958 --> 00:10:08.958\nthat really enhance the idea of solitude and expansion\n\n00:10:08.958 --> 00:10:10.958\nby means of various techniques.\n\n00:10:10.958 --> 00:10:14.958\nThis is a spa telephone. The idea is that it's become so difficult\n\n00:10:14.958 --> 00:10:15.958\nto have a private conversation anywhere\n\n00:10:15.958 --> 00:10:18.958\nthat you go to the spa, you have a massage, you have a facial,\n\n00:10:18.958 --> 00:10:20.958\nmaybe a rub, and then you have this beautiful pool\n\n00:10:20.958 --> 00:10:22.958\nwith this perfect temperature, and you can have\n\n00:10:22.958 --> 00:10:25.958\nthis isolation tank phone conversation\n\n00:10:25.958 --> 00:10:28.958\nwith whomever you've been wanting to talk with for a long time.\n\n00:10:28.958 --> 00:10:31.958\nAnd same thing here, Social Tele-presence.\n\n00:10:31.958 --> 00:10:33.958\nIt's actually already used by the military a little bit,\n\n00:10:33.958 --> 00:10:36.958\nbut it's the idea of being able to be somewhere else\n\n00:10:36.958 --> 00:10:40.958\nwith your senses while you're removed from it physically.\n\n00:10:40.958 --> 00:10:43.958\nAnd this is called Blind Date. It's a [unclear],\n\n00:10:43.958 --> 00:10:45.958\nso if you're too shy to be really at the date,\n\n00:10:45.958 --> 00:10:46.958\nyou can stay at a distance with your flowers\n\n00:10:47.958 --> 00:10:50.958\nand somebody else reenacts the date for you.\n\n00:10:50.958 --> 00:10:53.958\nRapid manufacturing is another big area\n\n00:10:53.958 --> 00:10:57.958\nin which technology and design are, I think,\n\n00:10:57.958 --> 00:11:01.958\nbound to change the world. You've heard about it before many times.\n\n00:11:01.958 --> 00:11:03.958\nRapid manufacturing is a computer file\n\n00:11:03.958 --> 00:11:06.958\nsent directly from the computer to the manufacturing machine.\n\n00:11:06.958 --> 00:11:10.958\nIt used to be called rapid prototyping, rapid modeling.\n\n00:11:10.958 --> 00:11:12.958\nIt started out in the '80s, but at the beginning\n\n00:11:12.958 --> 00:11:15.958\nit was machines carving out of a foam block\n\n00:11:15.958 --> 00:11:18.958\na model that was very, very fragile,\n\n00:11:18.958 --> 00:11:20.958\nand could not have any real use.\n\n00:11:20.958 --> 00:11:24.958\nSlowly but surely, the materials became better -- better resins.\n\n00:11:24.958 --> 00:11:26.958\nTechniques became better -- not only carving\n\n00:11:26.958 --> 00:11:32.958\nbut also stereolithography and laser -- solidifying all kinds of resins,\n\n00:11:32.958 --> 00:11:36.958\nwhether in powder or in liquid form. And the vats became bigger,\n\n00:11:36.958 --> 00:11:39.958\nto the point that now we can have actual chairs\n\n00:11:39.958 --> 00:11:41.958\nmade by rapid manufacturing.\n\n00:11:41.958 --> 00:11:43.958\nIt takes seven days today to manufacture a chair,\n\n00:11:44.958 --> 00:11:46.958\nbut you know what? One day it will take seven hours.\n\n00:11:46.958 --> 00:11:49.958\nAnd then the dream is that you'll be able to, from home,\n\n00:11:50.958 --> 00:11:52.958\ncustomize your chair. You know, companies and designers\n\n00:11:52.958 --> 00:11:55.958\nwill be designing the matrix or the margins\n\n00:11:55.958 --> 00:12:00.958\nthat respect both solidity and brand, and design identity.\n\n00:12:00.958 --> 00:12:03.958\nAnd then you can send it to the Kinko's store at the corner\n\n00:12:03.958 --> 00:12:06.958\nand go get your chair. Now, the implications of this are enormous,\n\n00:12:06.958 --> 00:12:09.958\nnot only regarding the participation of the final buyer\n\n00:12:10.958 --> 00:12:12.958\nin the design process, but also no tracking,\n\n00:12:12.958 --> 00:12:15.958\nno warehousing, no wasted materials.\n\n00:12:15.958 --> 00:12:18.958\nAlso, I can imagine many design manufacturers\n\n00:12:18.958 --> 00:12:20.958\nwill have to retool their own business plans\n\n00:12:20.958 --> 00:12:24.958\nand maybe invest in this Kinko's store. But it really is a big change.\n\n00:12:24.958 --> 00:12:27.958\nAnd here I'm showing a picture that was in Wired Magazine --\n\n00:12:27.958 --> 00:12:30.958\nyou know, the Artifacts of the Future section that I love so much --\n\n00:12:30.958 --> 00:12:32.958\nthat shows you can have your desktop 3D printer\n\n00:12:32.958 --> 00:12:34.958\nand print your own basketball.\n\n00:12:34.958 --> 00:12:38.958\nBut here instead are examples, you can already 3D-print textiles,\n\n00:12:38.958 --> 00:12:40.958\nwhich is very interesting.\n\n00:12:40.958 --> 00:12:43.958\nThis is just a really nice touch -- it's called slow prototyping.\n\n00:12:43.958 --> 00:12:48.958\nIt's a designer that put 10,000 bees at work and they built this vase.\n\n00:12:48.958 --> 00:12:51.958\nThey had a particular shape that they had to stay in.\n\n00:12:51.958 --> 00:12:52.958\nMapping and tagging.\n\n00:12:52.958 --> 00:12:56.958\nAs the capacity of computers becomes really, really big,\n\n00:12:56.958 --> 00:12:59.958\nand the capacity of our mind not that much bigger,\n\n00:13:00.958 --> 00:13:03.958\nwe find that we need to tag as much as we can what we do\n\n00:13:03.958 --> 00:13:06.958\nin order to then retrace our path.\n\n00:13:06.958 --> 00:13:08.958\nAlso, we do it in order to share with other people.\n\n00:13:08.958 --> 00:13:11.958\nAgain, this communal sense of experience\n\n00:13:11.958 --> 00:13:13.958\nthat seems to be so important today.\n\n00:13:13.958 --> 00:13:16.958\nSo, various ways to map and tag\n\n00:13:16.958 --> 00:13:19.958\nare also the work of many designers nowadays.\n\n00:13:20.958 --> 00:13:24.958\nAlso, the senses -- designers and scientists all work on trying to expand\n\n00:13:24.958 --> 00:13:28.958\nour senses capabilities so that we can achieve more.\n\n00:13:28.958 --> 00:13:31.958\nAnd also animal senses in a way.\n\n00:13:31.958 --> 00:13:35.958\nThis particular object that many people love so much\n\n00:13:35.958 --> 00:13:38.958\nis actually based on kind of a scientific experiment --\n\n00:13:38.958 --> 00:13:41.958\nthe fact that bees have a very strong olfactory sense,\n\n00:13:41.958 --> 00:13:45.958\nand so -- much like dogs that can smell certain kinds of skin cancer --\n\n00:13:45.958 --> 00:13:49.958\nbees can be trained by Pavlovian reflex\n\n00:13:49.958 --> 00:13:52.958\nto detect one type of cancer, and also pregnancy.\n\n00:13:52.958 --> 00:13:54.958\nAnd so this student at the RCA\n\n00:13:54.958 --> 00:13:57.958\ndesigned this beautiful blown-glass object\n\n00:13:57.958 --> 00:13:59.958\nwhere the bees move from one chamber to the other\n\n00:14:00.958 --> 00:14:02.958\nif they detect that particular smell\n\n00:14:02.958 --> 00:14:04.958\nthat signifies, in this case, pregnancy.\n\n00:14:04.958 --> 00:14:06.958\nAnother shape is made for cancer.\n\n00:14:06.958 --> 00:14:10.958\nDesign for Debate is a very interesting new endeavor\n\n00:14:10.958 --> 00:14:12.958\nthat designers have really shaped for themselves.\n\n00:14:13.958 --> 00:14:16.958\nSome designers don't design objects, products,\n\n00:14:16.958 --> 00:14:17.958\nthings that we're going to actually use,\n\n00:14:17.958 --> 00:14:21.958\nbut rather, they design scenarios that are object-based.\n\n00:14:21.958 --> 00:14:23.958\nThey're still very useful.\n\n00:14:23.958 --> 00:14:26.958\nThey help companies and other designers think better about the future.\n\n00:14:27.958 --> 00:14:30.958\nAnd usually they are accompanied by videos.\n\n00:14:30.958 --> 00:14:33.958\nThis is quite beautiful. It's Dunne and Raby, \"All the Robots.\"\n\n00:14:33.958 --> 00:14:36.958\nThose are a series of robots that are meant to be taken care of.\n\n00:14:37.958 --> 00:14:39.958\nWe always think that robots will take care of us,\n\n00:14:39.958 --> 00:14:41.958\nand instead they designed these robots that are very, very needy.\n\n00:14:41.958 --> 00:14:44.958\nYou need to take one in your arms and look at it in the eyes\n\n00:14:44.958 --> 00:14:46.958\nfor about five minutes before it does something.\n\n00:14:46.958 --> 00:14:49.958\nAnother one gets really, really nervous if you get in to the room,\n\n00:14:49.958 --> 00:14:51.958\nand starts shaking, so you have to calm it down.\n\n00:14:51.958 --> 00:14:54.958\nSo it's really a way to make us think more\n\n00:14:54.958 --> 00:14:56.958\nabout what robots mean to us.\n\n00:14:56.958 --> 00:15:00.958\nNoam Toran and \"Accessories for Lonely Men\":\n\n00:15:00.958 --> 00:15:02.958\nthe idea is that when you lose your loved one\n\n00:15:02.958 --> 00:15:04.958\nor you go through a bad breakup,\n\n00:15:04.958 --> 00:15:06.958\nwhat you miss the most are those annoying things\n\n00:15:07.958 --> 00:15:10.958\nthat you used to hate when you were with the other person.\n\n00:15:10.958 --> 00:15:12.958\nSo he designed all these series of accessories.\n\n00:15:12.958 --> 00:15:17.958\nThis one is something that takes away the sheets from you at night.\n\n00:15:17.958 --> 00:15:20.958\nThen there's another one that breathes on your neck.\n\n00:15:20.958 --> 00:15:22.958\nThere's another one that throws plates and breaks them.\n\n00:15:22.958 --> 00:15:26.958\nSo it's just this idea of what we really miss in life.\n\n00:15:26.958 --> 00:15:29.958\nElio Caccavale: he took the idea\n\n00:15:29.958 --> 00:15:32.958\nof those dolls that explain leukemia.\n\n00:15:32.958 --> 00:15:36.958\nHe's working on dolls that explain xenotransplantation,\n\n00:15:36.958 --> 00:15:41.958\nand also the spider gene into the goat, from a few years ago.\n\n00:15:41.958 --> 00:15:44.958\nHe's working for the exhibition on a whole series of dolls\n\n00:15:44.958 --> 00:15:47.958\nthat explain to children where babies come from today.\n\n00:15:47.958 --> 00:15:50.958\nBecause it's not anymore Mom, Dad, the flowers and the bees,\n\n00:15:50.958 --> 00:15:53.958\nand then there's the baby. No, it can be two moms, three dads,\n\n00:15:53.958 --> 00:15:56.958\nin-vitro -- there's the whole idea\n\n00:15:56.958 --> 00:15:59.958\nof how babies can be made today that has changed.\n\n00:16:00.958 --> 00:16:03.958\nSo it's a series of dolls that he's working on right now.\n\n00:16:04.958 --> 00:16:05.958\nOne of the most beautiful things\n\n00:16:05.958 --> 00:16:07.958\nis that designers really work on life,\n\n00:16:08.958 --> 00:16:10.958\neven though they take technology into account.\n\n00:16:10.958 --> 00:16:12.958\nAnd many designers have been working recently\n\n00:16:12.958 --> 00:16:14.958\non the idea of death and mourning,\n\n00:16:14.958 --> 00:16:17.958\nand what we can do about it today with new technologies.\n\n00:16:18.958 --> 00:16:21.958\nOr how we should behave about it with new technologies.\n\n00:16:21.958 --> 00:16:24.958\nThese three objects over there are hard drives\n\n00:16:24.958 --> 00:16:27.958\nwith a Bluetooth connection. But they're in reality\n\n00:16:27.958 --> 00:16:29.958\nvery, very beautiful sculpted artifacts\n\n00:16:30.958 --> 00:16:33.958\nthat contain the whole desktop and computer memory\n\n00:16:33.958 --> 00:16:35.958\nof somebody who passed away.\n\n00:16:35.958 --> 00:16:37.958\nSo instead of having only the pictures,\n\n00:16:37.958 --> 00:16:40.958\nyou will be able to put this object next to the computer\n\n00:16:40.958 --> 00:16:42.958\nand all of a sudden have, you know,\n\n00:16:42.958 --> 00:16:45.958\nGertrude's whole life and all of her files\n\n00:16:45.958 --> 00:16:46.958\nand her address book come alive.\n\n00:16:46.958 --> 00:16:49.958\nAnd this is even better. This is Auger-Loizeau, \"AfterLife.\"\n\n00:16:49.958 --> 00:16:52.958\nIt's the idea that some people don't believe in an afterlife.\n\n00:16:52.958 --> 00:16:54.958\nSo to give them something tangible that shows that\n\n00:16:55.958 --> 00:16:59.958\nthere is something after death, they take the gastric juices\n\n00:16:59.958 --> 00:17:01.958\nof people who passed away and concentrate them,\n\n00:17:01.958 --> 00:17:04.958\nand put them into a battery that can actually be used\n\n00:17:04.958 --> 00:17:08.958\nto power flashlights. They also go -- you know, sex toys, whatever.\n\n00:17:08.958 --> 00:17:12.958\nIt's quite amazing how these things can make you smile,\n\n00:17:12.958 --> 00:17:14.958\ncan make you laugh, can make you cry sometimes.\n\n00:17:14.958 --> 00:17:17.958\nBut I'm hoping that this particular exhibition\n\n00:17:17.958 --> 00:17:20.958\nwill be able to trace a new portrait of where design is going --\n\n00:17:20.958 --> 00:17:23.958\nwhich is always, hopefully, a portrait a few years in advance\n\n00:17:23.958 --> 00:17:25.958\nof where the world is going.\n\n00:17:25.958 --> 00:17:26.958\nThank you very much."}, {"title": "On glamour", "duration": "975", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/virginia_postrel_on_glamour", "transcript": "You might be wondering why I'm wearing sunglasses, and one answer to that is, because I'm here to talk about glamour. So, we all think we know what glamour is. Here it is. It's glamorous movie stars, like Marlene Dietrich. And it comes in a male form, too \u2014 very glamorous. Not only can he shoot, drive, drink \u2014 you know, he drinks wine, there actually is a little wine in there \u2014 and of course, always wears a tuxedo. But I think that glamour actually has a much broader meaning \u2014 one that is true for the movie stars and the fictional characters, but also comes in other forms.A magazine? Well, it's certainly not this one. This is the least glamorous magazine on the newsstand \u2014 it's all about sex tips. Sex tips are not glamorous. And Drew Barrymore, for all her wonderful charm, is not glamorous either. But there is a glamour of industry. This is Margaret Bourke-White's \u2014 one of her pictures she did. Fantastic, glamorous pictures of steel mills and paper mills and all kinds of glamorous industrial places. And there's the mythic glamour of the garage entrepreneur. This is the Hewlett-Packard garage. We know everyone who starts a business in a garage ends up founding Hewlett-Packard. There's the glamour of physics. What could be more glamorous than understanding the entire universe, grand unification? And, by the way, it helps if you're Brian Greene \u2014 he has other kinds of glamour.And there is, of course, this glamour. This is very, very glamorous: the glamour of outer space \u2014 and not the alien-style glamour, but the nice, clean, early '60s version. So what do we mean by glamour? Well, one thing you can do if you want to know what glamour means is you can look in the dictionary. And it actually helps a lot more if you look in a very old dictionary, in this case the 1913 dictionary. Because for centuries, glamour had a very particular meaning, and the word was actually used differently from the way we think of it. You had \"a\" glamour. It wasn't glamour as a quality \u2014 you \"cast a glamour.\" Glamour was a literal magic spell. Not a metaphorical one, the way we use it today, but a literal magic spell associated with witches and gypsies and to some extent, Celtic magic. And over the years, around the turn of the 20th century, it started to take on this other kind of deception \u2014 this definition for any artificial interest in, or association with, an object through which it appears delusively magnified or glorified. But still, glamour is an illusion. Glamour is a magic spell. And there's something dangerous about glamour throughout most of history. When the witches cast a magic spell on you, it was not in your self-interest \u2014 it was to get you to act against your interest.Well of course, in the 20th century, glamour came to have this different meaning associated with Hollywood. And this is Hedy Lamarr. Hedy Lamarr said, \"Anyone can look glamorous, all you have to do is sit there and look stupid.\" (Laughter) But in fact, with all due respect to Hedy \u2014 about whom we'll hear more later \u2014 there's a lot more to it. There was a tremendous amount of technical achievement associated with creating this Hollywood glamour. There were scores of retouchers and lighting experts and make-up experts. You can go to the museum of Hollywood history in Hollywood and see Max Factor's special rooms that he painted different colors depending on the complexion of the star he was going to make up. So you've got this highly stylized portrait of something that was not entirely of this earth \u2014 it was a portrait of a star. And actually, we see glamorized photos of stars all the time \u2014 they call them false color.Glamour is a form of falsification, but falsification to achieve a particular purpose. It may be to illuminate the star; it may be to sell a film. And it involves a great deal of technique. It's not \u2014 glamour is not something \u2014 you don't wake up in the morning glamorous. I don't care who you are. Even Nicole Kidman doesn't wake up in the morning glamorous. There is a process of \"idealization, glorification and dramatization,\" and it's not just the case for people. Glamour doesn't have to be people. Architectural photography \u2014 Julius Schulman, who has talked about transfiguration, took this fabulous, famous picture of the Kauffman House. Architectural photography is extremely glamorous. It puts you into this special, special world. This is Alex Ross's comic book art, which appears to be extremely realistic, as part of his style is he gives you a kind of realism in his comic art. Except that light doesn't work this way in the real world.When you stack people in rows, the ones in the background look smaller than the ones in the foreground \u2014 but not in the world of glamour. What glamour is all about \u2014 I took this from a blurb in the table of contents of New York magazine, which was telling us that glamour is back \u2014 glamour is all about transcending the everyday. And I think that that's starting to get at what the core that combines all sorts of glamour is. This is Filippino Lippi's 1543 portrait of Saint Apollonia. And I don't know who she is either, but this is the [16th] century equivalent of a supermodel. It's a very glamorous portrait. Why is it glamorous? It's glamorous, first, because she is beautiful \u2014 but that does not make you glamorous, that only makes you beautiful. She is graceful, she is mysterious and she is transcendent, and those are the central qualities of glamour. You don't see her eyes; they're looking downward. She's not looking away from you exactly, but you have to mentally imagine her world. She's encouraging you to contemplate this higher world to which she belongs, where she can be completely tranquil while holding the iron instruments of her death by torture. Mel Gibson's \"Passion Of The Christ\" \u2014 not glamorous. That's glamour: that's Michelangelo's \"Pieta,\" where Mary is the same age as Jesus and they're both awfully happy and pleasant.Glamour invites us to live in a different world. It has to simultaneously be mysterious, a little bit distant \u2014 that's why, often in these glamour shots, the person is not looking at the audience, it's why sunglasses are glamorous \u2014 but also not so far above us that we can't identify with the person. In some sense, there has to be something like us. So as I say, in religious art, you know, God is not glamorous. God cannot be glamorous because God is omnipotent, omniscient \u2014 too far above us. And yet you will see in religious art, saints or the Virgin Mary will often be portrayed \u2014 not always \u2014 in glamorous forms. As I said earlier, glamour does not have to be about people, but it has to have this transcendent quality. What is it about Superman? Aside from Alex Ross's style, which is very glamorous, one thing about Superman is he makes you believe that a man can fly.Glamour is all about transcending this world and getting to an idealized, perfect place. And this is one reason that modes of transportation tend to be extremely glamorous. The less experience we have with them, the more glamorous they are. So you can do a glamorized picture of a car, but you can't do a glamorized picture of traffic. You can do a glamorized picture of an airplane, but not the inside. The notion is that it's going to transport you, and the story is not about, you know, the guy in front of you in the airplane, who has this nasty little kid, or the big cough. The story is about where you're arriving, or thinking about where you're arriving. And this sense of being transported is one reason that we have glamour styling. This sort of streamlining styling is not just glamorous because we associate it with movies of that period, but because, in it's streamlining, it transports us from the everyday.The same thing \u2014 arches are very glamorous. Arches with stained glass \u2014 even more glamorous. Staircases that curve away from you are glamorous. I happen to find that particular staircase picture very glamorous because, to me, it captures the whole promise of the academic contemplative life \u2014 but maybe that's because I went to Princeton. Anyway, skylines are super glamorous, city streets \u2014 not so glamorous. You know, when you get, actually to this town it has reality. The horizon, the open road, is very, very glamorous. There are few things more glamorous than the horizon \u2014 except, possibly, multiple horizons. Of course, here you don't feel the cold, or the heat \u2014 you just see the possibilities. In order to pull glamour off, you need this Renaissance quality of sprezzatura, which is a term coined by Castiglione in his book, \"The Book Of The Courtier.\" There's the not-glamorous version of what it looks like today, after a few centuries.And sprezzatura is the art that conceals art. It makes things look effortless. You don't think about how Nicole Kidman is maneuvering that dress \u2014 she just looks completely natural. And I remember reading, after the Lara Croft movies, how Angelina Jolie would go home completely black and blue. Of course, they covered that with make-up, because Lara Croft did all those same stunts \u2014 but she doesn't get black and blue, because she has sprezzatura. \"To conceal all art and make whatever is done or said appear to be without effort\": And this is one of the critical aspects of glamour. Glamour is about editing. How do you create the sense of transcendence, the sense of evoking a perfect world? The sense of, you know, life could be better, I could join this \u2014 I could be a perfect person, I could join this perfect world. We don't tell you all the grubby details.Now, this was kindly lent to me by Jeff Bezos, from last year. This is underneath Jeff's desk. This is what the real world of computers, lamps, electrical appliances of all kinds, looks like. But if you look in a catalog \u2014 particularly a catalog of modern, beautiful objects for your home \u2014 it looks like this. There are no cords. Look next time you get these catalogs in your mail \u2014 you can usually figure out where they hid the cord. But there's always this illusion that if you buy this lamp, you will live in a world without cords. (Laughter) And the same thing is true of, if you buy this laptop or you buy this computer \u2014 and even in these wireless eras, you don't get to live in the world without cords. You have to have mystery and you have to have grace. And there she is \u2014 Grace. This is the most glamorous picture, I think, ever. Part of the thing is that, in \"Rear Window,\" the question is, is she too glamorous to live in his world? And the answer is no, but of course it's really just a movie.Here's Hedy Lamarr again. And, you know, this kind of head covering is extremely glamorous because, like sunglasses, it conceals and reveals at the same time. Translucence is glamorous \u2014 that's why all these people wear pearls. It's why barware is glamorous. Glamour is translucent \u2014 not transparent, not opaque. It invites us into the world but it doesn't give us a completely clear picture. And I think if Grace Kelly is the most glamorous person, maybe a spiral staircase with glass block may be the most glamorous interior shot, because a spiral staircase is incredibly glamorous. It has that sense of going up and away, and yet you never think about how you would really trip if you were \u2014 particularly going down. And of course glass block has that sense of translucence. So, this session's supposed to be about pure pleasure but glamour's really partly about meaning. All individuals and all cultures have ideals that cannot possibly be realized in reality.They have contradictions, they uphold principles that are incommensurable with each other \u2014 whatever it is \u2014 and yet these ideals give meaning and purpose to our lives as cultures and as individuals. And the way we deal with that is we displace them \u2014 we put them into a golden world, an imagined world, an age of heroes, the world to come. And in the life of an individual, we often associate that with some object. The white picket fence, the perfect house. The perfect kitchen \u2014 no bills on the counter in the perfect kitchen. You know, you buy that Viking range, this is what your kitchen will look like. The perfect love life \u2014 symbolized by the perfect necklace, the perfect diamond ring. The perfect getaway in your perfect car. This is an interior design firm that is literally called Utopia. The perfect office \u2014 again, no cords, as far as I can tell. And certainly, no, it doesn't look a thing like my office. I mean, there's no paper on the desk. We want this golden world. And some people get rich enough, and if they have their ideals \u2014 in a sort of domestic sense, they get to acquire their perfect world.Dean Koontz built this fabulous home theater, which is \u2014 I don't think accidentally \u2014 in Art Deco style. That symbolizes this sense of being safe and at home. This is not always good, because what is your perfect world? What is your ideal, and also, what has been edited out? Is it something important? \"The Matrix\" is a movie that is all about glamour. I could do a whole talk on \"The Matrix\" and glamour. It was criticized for glamorizing violence, because, look \u2014 sunglasses and those long coats, and, of course, they could walk up walls and do all these kinds of things that are impossible in the real world. This is another Margaret Bourke-White photo. This is from Soviet Union. Attractive. I mean, look how happy the people are, and good-looking too. You know, we're marching toward Utopia.I'm not a fan of PETA, but I think this is a great ad. Because what they're doing is they're saying, your coat's not so glamorous, what's been edited out is something important. But actually, what's even more important than remembering what's been edited out is thinking, are the ideals good? Because glamour can be very totalitarian and deceptive. And it's not just a matter of glamorizing cleaning your floor. This is from \"Triumph Of The Will\" \u2014 brilliant editing to cut together things. There's a glamour shot. National Socialism is all about glamour. It was a very aesthetic ideology. It was all about cleaning up Germany, and the West, and the world, and ridding it of anything unglamorous. So glamour can be dangerous.I think glamour has a genuine appeal, has a genuine value. I'm not against glamour. But there's a kind of wonder in the stuff that gets edited away in the cords of life. And there is both a way to avoid the dangers of glamour and a way to broaden your appreciation of it. And that's to take Isaac Mizrahi's advice and confront the manipulation of it all, and sort of admit that manipulation is something that we enjoy, but also enjoy how it happens. And here's Hedy Lamarr. She's very glamorous but, you know, she invented spread-spectrum technology. So she's even more glamorous if you know that she really wasn't stupid, even though she thought she could look stupid.David Hockney talks about how the appreciation of this very glamorous painting is heightened if you think about the fact that it takes two weeks to paint this splash, which only took a fraction of a second to happen. There is a book out in the bookstore \u2014 it's called \"Symphony In Steel,\" and it's about the stuff that's hidden under the skin of the Disney Center. And that has a fascination. It's not necessarily glamorous, but unveiling the glamour has an appeal. There's a wonderful book called \"Crowns\" that's all these glamour pictures of black women in their church hats. And there's a quote from one of these women, and she talks about, \"As a little girl, I'd admire women at church with beautiful hats. They looked like beautiful dolls, like they'd just stepped out of a magazine. But I also knew how hard they worked all week. Sometimes under those hats there's a lot of joy and a lot of sorrow.\" And, actually, you get more appreciation for glamour when you realize what went into creating it. Thank you.", "id": 375, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:11.958 --> 00:00:13.958\nYou might be wondering why I'm wearing sunglasses,\n\n00:00:13.958 --> 00:00:18.958\nand one answer to that is, because I'm here to talk about glamour.\n\n00:00:18.958 --> 00:00:21.958\nSo, we all think we know what glamour is. Here it is.\n\n00:00:21.958 --> 00:00:24.958\nIt's glamorous movie stars, like Marlene Dietrich.\n\n00:00:24.958 --> 00:00:26.958\nAnd it comes in a male form, too --\n\n00:00:26.958 --> 00:00:28.958\nvery glamorous.\n\n00:00:28.958 --> 00:00:32.958\nNot only can he shoot, drive, drink -- you know, he drinks wine,\n\n00:00:32.958 --> 00:00:34.958\nthere actually is a little wine in there --\n\n00:00:34.958 --> 00:00:37.958\nand of course, always wears a tuxedo.\n\n00:00:37.958 --> 00:00:41.958\nBut I think that glamour actually has a much broader meaning --\n\n00:00:41.958 --> 00:00:45.958\none that is true for the movie stars and the fictional characters,\n\n00:00:45.958 --> 00:00:47.958\nbut also comes in other forms.\n\n00:00:47.958 --> 00:00:49.958\nA magazine?\n\n00:00:49.958 --> 00:00:51.958\nWell, it's certainly not this one.\n\n00:00:51.958 --> 00:00:54.958\nThis is the least glamorous magazine on the newsstand -- it's all about sex tips.\n\n00:00:54.958 --> 00:00:56.958\nSex tips are not glamorous.\n\n00:00:56.958 --> 00:00:59.958\nAnd Drew Barrymore, for all her wonderful charm,\n\n00:00:59.958 --> 00:01:01.958\nis not glamorous either.\n\n00:01:01.958 --> 00:01:03.958\nBut there is a glamour of industry.\n\n00:01:03.958 --> 00:01:05.958\nThis is Margaret Bourke-White's --\n\n00:01:05.958 --> 00:01:07.958\none of her pictures she did.\n\n00:01:07.958 --> 00:01:10.958\nFantastic, glamorous pictures\n\n00:01:10.958 --> 00:01:14.958\nof steel mills and paper mills and all kinds of glamorous industrial places.\n\n00:01:14.958 --> 00:01:16.958\nAnd there's the mythic glamour\n\n00:01:16.958 --> 00:01:18.958\nof the garage entrepreneur.\n\n00:01:18.958 --> 00:01:20.958\nThis is the Hewlett-Packard garage.\n\n00:01:20.958 --> 00:01:23.958\nWe know everyone who starts a business in a garage\n\n00:01:23.958 --> 00:01:26.958\nends up founding Hewlett-Packard.\n\n00:01:26.958 --> 00:01:28.958\nThere's the glamour of physics.\n\n00:01:28.958 --> 00:01:30.958\nWhat could be more glamorous than understanding the entire universe,\n\n00:01:30.958 --> 00:01:34.958\ngrand unification? And, by the way, it helps if you're Brian Greene --\n\n00:01:34.958 --> 00:01:36.958\nhe has other kinds of glamour.\n\n00:01:36.958 --> 00:01:38.958\nAnd there is, of course, this glamour.\n\n00:01:38.958 --> 00:01:41.958\nThis is very, very glamorous: the glamour of outer space --\n\n00:01:41.958 --> 00:01:44.958\nand not the alien-style glamour,\n\n00:01:44.958 --> 00:01:47.958\nbut the nice, clean, early '60s version.\n\n00:01:47.958 --> 00:01:49.958\nSo what do we mean by glamour?\n\n00:01:49.958 --> 00:01:53.958\nWell, one thing you can do if you want to know what glamour means\n\n00:01:53.958 --> 00:01:55.958\nis you can look in the dictionary.\n\n00:01:55.958 --> 00:01:58.958\nAnd it actually helps a lot more if you look in a very old dictionary,\n\n00:01:58.958 --> 00:02:00.958\nin this case the 1913 dictionary.\n\n00:02:00.958 --> 00:02:05.958\nBecause for centuries, glamour had a very particular meaning,\n\n00:02:05.958 --> 00:02:10.958\nand the word was actually used differently from the way we think of it.\n\n00:02:10.958 --> 00:02:12.958\nYou had \"a\" glamour.\n\n00:02:12.958 --> 00:02:14.958\nIt wasn't glamour as a quality -- you \"cast a glamour.\"\n\n00:02:14.958 --> 00:02:17.958\nGlamour was a literal magic spell.\n\n00:02:17.958 --> 00:02:19.958\nNot a metaphorical one, the way we use it today,\n\n00:02:19.958 --> 00:02:23.958\nbut a literal magic spell associated with witches and gypsies\n\n00:02:23.958 --> 00:02:26.958\nand to some extent, Celtic magic.\n\n00:02:26.958 --> 00:02:29.958\nAnd over the years, around the turn of the 20th century,\n\n00:02:29.958 --> 00:02:35.958\nit started to take on this other kind of deception --\n\n00:02:35.958 --> 00:02:40.958\nthis definition for any artificial interest in, or association with,\n\n00:02:40.958 --> 00:02:45.958\nan object through which it appears delusively magnified or glorified.\n\n00:02:45.958 --> 00:02:47.958\nBut still, glamour is an illusion.\n\n00:02:47.958 --> 00:02:50.958\nGlamour is a magic spell.\n\n00:02:50.958 --> 00:02:52.958\nAnd there's something dangerous about glamour\n\n00:02:52.958 --> 00:02:56.958\nthroughout most of history. When the witches cast a magic spell\n\n00:02:56.958 --> 00:02:58.958\non you, it was not in your self-interest --\n\n00:02:58.958 --> 00:03:00.958\nit was to get you to act against your interest.\n\n00:03:00.958 --> 00:03:02.958\nWell of course, in the 20th century,\n\n00:03:02.958 --> 00:03:06.958\nglamour came to have this different meaning associated with Hollywood.\n\n00:03:06.958 --> 00:03:08.958\nAnd this is Hedy Lamarr.\n\n00:03:08.958 --> 00:03:10.958\nHedy Lamarr said, \"Anyone can look glamorous,\n\n00:03:10.958 --> 00:03:13.958\nall you have to do is sit there and look stupid.\" (Laughter)\n\n00:03:13.958 --> 00:03:18.958\nBut in fact, with all due respect to Hedy --\n\n00:03:18.958 --> 00:03:22.958\nabout whom we'll hear more later -- there's a lot more to it.\n\n00:03:22.958 --> 00:03:25.958\nThere was a tremendous amount of technical achievement\n\n00:03:25.958 --> 00:03:27.958\nassociated with creating this Hollywood glamour.\n\n00:03:27.958 --> 00:03:31.958\nThere were scores of retouchers and lighting experts and make-up experts.\n\n00:03:31.958 --> 00:03:34.958\nYou can go to the museum of Hollywood history in Hollywood\n\n00:03:34.958 --> 00:03:37.958\nand see Max Factor's special rooms that he painted different colors\n\n00:03:37.958 --> 00:03:41.958\ndepending on the complexion of the star he was going to make up.\n\n00:03:41.958 --> 00:03:44.958\nSo you've got this highly stylized portrait of something\n\n00:03:44.958 --> 00:03:47.958\nthat was not entirely of this earth -- it was a portrait of a star.\n\n00:03:47.958 --> 00:03:51.958\nAnd actually, we see glamorized photos of stars all the time --\n\n00:03:51.958 --> 00:03:53.958\nthey call them false color.\n\n00:03:53.958 --> 00:03:57.958\nGlamour is a form of falsification,\n\n00:03:57.958 --> 00:04:00.958\nbut falsification to achieve a particular purpose.\n\n00:04:00.958 --> 00:04:04.958\nIt may be to illuminate the star; it may be to sell a film.\n\n00:04:04.958 --> 00:04:06.958\nAnd it involves a great deal of technique.\n\n00:04:06.958 --> 00:04:08.958\nIt's not -- glamour is not something --\n\n00:04:08.958 --> 00:04:11.958\nyou don't wake up in the morning glamorous. I don't care who you are.\n\n00:04:11.958 --> 00:04:14.958\nEven Nicole Kidman doesn't wake up in the morning glamorous.\n\n00:04:14.958 --> 00:04:18.958\nThere is a process of \"idealization, glorification and dramatization,\"\n\n00:04:18.958 --> 00:04:20.958\nand it's not just the case for people.\n\n00:04:20.958 --> 00:04:22.958\nGlamour doesn't have to be people.\n\n00:04:22.958 --> 00:04:24.958\nArchitectural photography --\n\n00:04:24.958 --> 00:04:27.958\nJulius Schulman, who has talked about transfiguration,\n\n00:04:27.958 --> 00:04:30.958\ntook this fabulous, famous picture of the Kauffman House.\n\n00:04:30.958 --> 00:04:33.958\nArchitectural photography is extremely glamorous.\n\n00:04:33.958 --> 00:04:37.958\nIt puts you into this special, special world.\n\n00:04:37.958 --> 00:04:40.958\nThis is Alex Ross's comic book art,\n\n00:04:40.958 --> 00:04:42.958\nwhich appears to be extremely realistic,\n\n00:04:42.958 --> 00:04:47.958\nas part of his style is he gives you a kind of realism in his comic art.\n\n00:04:47.958 --> 00:04:50.958\nExcept that light doesn't work this way in the real world.\n\n00:04:50.958 --> 00:04:52.958\nWhen you stack people in rows,\n\n00:04:52.958 --> 00:04:55.958\nthe ones in the background look smaller than the ones in the foreground --\n\n00:04:55.958 --> 00:04:58.958\nbut not in the world of glamour.\n\n00:04:58.958 --> 00:05:01.958\nWhat glamour is all about -- I took this from a blurb\n\n00:05:01.958 --> 00:05:04.958\nin the table of contents of New York magazine,\n\n00:05:04.958 --> 00:05:06.958\nwhich was telling us that glamour is back --\n\n00:05:06.958 --> 00:05:09.958\nglamour is all about transcending the everyday.\n\n00:05:09.958 --> 00:05:12.958\nAnd I think that that's starting to get at what the core\n\n00:05:12.958 --> 00:05:15.958\nthat combines all sorts of glamour is.\n\n00:05:15.958 --> 00:05:20.958\nThis is Filippino Lippi's 1543 portrait of Saint Apollonia.\n\n00:05:20.958 --> 00:05:22.958\nAnd I don't know who she is either,\n\n00:05:22.958 --> 00:05:25.958\nbut this is the [16th] century equivalent of a supermodel.\n\n00:05:25.958 --> 00:05:27.958\nIt's a very glamorous portrait.\n\n00:05:27.958 --> 00:05:29.958\nWhy is it glamorous?\n\n00:05:29.958 --> 00:05:31.958\nIt's glamorous, first, because she is beautiful --\n\n00:05:31.958 --> 00:05:33.958\nbut that does not make you glamorous,\n\n00:05:33.958 --> 00:05:35.958\nthat only makes you beautiful.\n\n00:05:35.958 --> 00:05:40.958\nShe is graceful, she is mysterious and she is transcendent,\n\n00:05:40.958 --> 00:05:42.958\nand those are the central qualities of glamour.\n\n00:05:42.958 --> 00:05:46.958\nYou don't see her eyes; they're looking downward.\n\n00:05:46.958 --> 00:05:48.958\nShe's not looking away from you exactly,\n\n00:05:48.958 --> 00:05:52.958\nbut you have to mentally imagine her world.\n\n00:05:52.958 --> 00:05:56.958\nShe's encouraging you to contemplate this higher world\n\n00:05:56.958 --> 00:05:59.958\nto which she belongs, where she can be completely tranquil\n\n00:05:59.958 --> 00:06:03.958\nwhile holding the iron instruments of her death by torture.\n\n00:06:03.958 --> 00:06:06.958\nMel Gibson's \"Passion Of The Christ\" -- not glamorous.\n\n00:06:06.958 --> 00:06:08.958\nThat's glamour:\n\n00:06:08.958 --> 00:06:11.958\nthat's Michelangelo's \"Pieta,\" where Mary is the same age as Jesus\n\n00:06:11.958 --> 00:06:14.958\nand they're both awfully happy and pleasant.\n\n00:06:14.958 --> 00:06:17.958\nGlamour invites us to live in a different world.\n\n00:06:17.958 --> 00:06:21.958\nIt has to simultaneously be mysterious, a little bit distant --\n\n00:06:21.958 --> 00:06:23.958\nthat's why, often in these glamour shots,\n\n00:06:23.958 --> 00:06:25.958\nthe person is not looking at the audience,\n\n00:06:25.958 --> 00:06:28.958\nit's why sunglasses are glamorous --\n\n00:06:28.958 --> 00:06:32.958\nbut also not so far above us that we can't identify with the person.\n\n00:06:32.958 --> 00:06:36.958\nIn some sense, there has to be something like us.\n\n00:06:36.958 --> 00:06:39.958\nSo as I say, in religious art, you know, God is not glamorous.\n\n00:06:39.958 --> 00:06:42.958\nGod cannot be glamorous because God is omnipotent,\n\n00:06:42.958 --> 00:06:44.958\nomniscient -- too far above us.\n\n00:06:44.958 --> 00:06:47.958\nAnd yet you will see in religious art, saints or the Virgin Mary\n\n00:06:47.958 --> 00:06:50.958\nwill often be portrayed -- not always -- in glamorous forms.\n\n00:06:50.958 --> 00:06:54.958\nAs I said earlier, glamour does not have to be about people,\n\n00:06:54.958 --> 00:06:57.958\nbut it has to have this transcendent quality.\n\n00:06:57.958 --> 00:06:59.958\nWhat is it about Superman?\n\n00:06:59.958 --> 00:07:01.958\nAside from Alex Ross's style, which is very glamorous,\n\n00:07:01.958 --> 00:07:05.958\none thing about Superman is he makes you believe that a man can fly.\n\n00:07:05.958 --> 00:07:08.958\nGlamour is all about transcending this world\n\n00:07:08.958 --> 00:07:12.958\nand getting to an idealized, perfect place.\n\n00:07:12.958 --> 00:07:16.958\nAnd this is one reason that modes of transportation\n\n00:07:16.958 --> 00:07:18.958\ntend to be extremely glamorous.\n\n00:07:18.958 --> 00:07:20.958\nThe less experience we have with them,\n\n00:07:20.958 --> 00:07:22.958\nthe more glamorous they are.\n\n00:07:22.958 --> 00:07:25.958\nSo you can do a glamorized picture of a car,\n\n00:07:25.958 --> 00:07:27.958\nbut you can't do a glamorized picture of traffic.\n\n00:07:27.958 --> 00:07:31.958\nYou can do a glamorized picture of an airplane, but not the inside.\n\n00:07:31.958 --> 00:07:33.958\nThe notion is that it's going to transport you,\n\n00:07:33.958 --> 00:07:37.958\nand the story is not about, you know, the guy in front of you in the airplane,\n\n00:07:37.958 --> 00:07:41.958\nwho has this nasty little kid, or the big cough.\n\n00:07:41.958 --> 00:07:43.958\nThe story is about where you're arriving,\n\n00:07:43.958 --> 00:07:45.958\nor thinking about where you're arriving.\n\n00:07:45.958 --> 00:07:47.958\nAnd this sense of being transported\n\n00:07:47.958 --> 00:07:51.958\nis one reason that we have glamour styling.\n\n00:07:51.958 --> 00:07:55.958\nThis sort of streamlining styling is not just glamorous\n\n00:07:55.958 --> 00:07:59.958\nbecause we associate it with movies of that period, but because,\n\n00:07:59.958 --> 00:08:02.958\nin it's streamlining, it transports us from the everyday.\n\n00:08:02.958 --> 00:08:05.958\nThe same thing -- arches are very glamorous.\n\n00:08:05.958 --> 00:08:08.958\nArches with stained glass -- even more glamorous.\n\n00:08:08.958 --> 00:08:11.958\nStaircases that curve away from you are glamorous.\n\n00:08:11.958 --> 00:08:14.958\nI happen to find that particular staircase picture very glamorous\n\n00:08:14.958 --> 00:08:16.958\nbecause, to me, it captures the whole promise\n\n00:08:16.958 --> 00:08:19.958\nof the academic contemplative life --\n\n00:08:19.958 --> 00:08:21.958\nbut maybe that's because I went to Princeton.\n\n00:08:21.958 --> 00:08:24.958\nAnyway, skylines are super glamorous,\n\n00:08:24.958 --> 00:08:26.958\ncity streets -- not so glamorous.\n\n00:08:26.958 --> 00:08:29.958\nYou know, when you get, actually to this town it has reality.\n\n00:08:29.958 --> 00:08:33.958\nThe horizon, the open road, is very, very glamorous.\n\n00:08:33.958 --> 00:08:36.958\nThere are few things more glamorous than the horizon --\n\n00:08:36.958 --> 00:08:40.958\nexcept, possibly, multiple horizons.\n\n00:08:40.958 --> 00:08:45.958\nOf course, here you don't feel the cold, or the heat --\n\n00:08:45.958 --> 00:08:47.958\nyou just see the possibilities.\n\n00:08:47.958 --> 00:08:51.958\nIn order to pull glamour off, you need this Renaissance quality\n\n00:08:51.958 --> 00:08:55.958\nof sprezzatura, which is a term coined by Castiglione\n\n00:08:56.958 --> 00:08:58.958\nin his book, \"The Book Of The Courtier.\"\n\n00:08:58.958 --> 00:09:01.958\nThere's the not-glamorous version of what it looks like today,\n\n00:09:01.958 --> 00:09:03.958\nafter a few centuries.\n\n00:09:03.958 --> 00:09:07.958\nAnd sprezzatura is the art that conceals art.\n\n00:09:07.958 --> 00:09:09.958\nIt makes things look effortless.\n\n00:09:09.958 --> 00:09:13.958\nYou don't think about how Nicole Kidman is maneuvering that dress --\n\n00:09:13.958 --> 00:09:15.958\nshe just looks completely natural.\n\n00:09:15.958 --> 00:09:18.958\nAnd I remember reading, after the Lara Croft movies,\n\n00:09:18.958 --> 00:09:22.958\nhow Angelina Jolie would go home completely black and blue.\n\n00:09:22.958 --> 00:09:24.958\nOf course, they covered that with make-up,\n\n00:09:24.958 --> 00:09:26.958\nbecause Lara Croft did all those same stunts --\n\n00:09:26.958 --> 00:09:30.958\nbut she doesn't get black and blue, because she has sprezzatura.\n\n00:09:30.958 --> 00:09:35.958\n\"To conceal all art and make whatever is done or said appear to be without effort\":\n\n00:09:35.958 --> 00:09:38.958\nAnd this is one of the critical aspects of glamour.\n\n00:09:38.958 --> 00:09:40.958\nGlamour is about editing.\n\n00:09:40.958 --> 00:09:42.958\nHow do you create the sense of transcendence,\n\n00:09:42.958 --> 00:09:45.958\nthe sense of evoking a perfect world?\n\n00:09:45.958 --> 00:09:49.958\nThe sense of, you know, life could be better, I could join this --\n\n00:09:49.958 --> 00:09:51.958\nI could be a perfect person, I could join this perfect world.\n\n00:09:51.958 --> 00:09:54.958\nWe don't tell you all the grubby details.\n\n00:09:54.958 --> 00:09:58.958\nNow, this was kindly lent to me by Jeff Bezos, from last year.\n\n00:09:58.958 --> 00:10:00.958\nThis is underneath Jeff's desk.\n\n00:10:00.958 --> 00:10:03.958\nThis is what the real world of computers,\n\n00:10:03.958 --> 00:10:07.958\nlamps, electrical appliances of all kinds, looks like.\n\n00:10:07.958 --> 00:10:09.958\nBut if you look in a catalog --\n\n00:10:09.958 --> 00:10:12.958\nparticularly a catalog of modern, beautiful objects for your home --\n\n00:10:12.958 --> 00:10:14.958\nit looks like this.\n\n00:10:14.958 --> 00:10:16.958\nThere are no cords.\n\n00:10:16.958 --> 00:10:19.958\nLook next time you get these catalogs in your mail --\n\n00:10:19.958 --> 00:10:22.958\nyou can usually figure out where they hid the cord.\n\n00:10:22.958 --> 00:10:25.958\nBut there's always this illusion that if you buy this lamp,\n\n00:10:25.958 --> 00:10:28.958\nyou will live in a world without cords. (Laughter)\n\n00:10:28.958 --> 00:10:31.958\nAnd the same thing is true of, if you buy this laptop\n\n00:10:31.958 --> 00:10:34.958\nor you buy this computer -- and even in these wireless eras,\n\n00:10:34.958 --> 00:10:36.958\nyou don't get to live in the world without cords.\n\n00:10:36.958 --> 00:10:40.958\nYou have to have mystery and you have to have grace.\n\n00:10:40.958 --> 00:10:42.958\nAnd there she is -- Grace.\n\n00:10:42.958 --> 00:10:44.958\nThis is the most glamorous picture, I think, ever.\n\n00:10:44.958 --> 00:10:47.958\nPart of the thing is that, in \"Rear Window,\"\n\n00:10:47.958 --> 00:10:50.958\nthe question is, is she too glamorous to live in his world?\n\n00:10:50.958 --> 00:10:53.958\nAnd the answer is no, but of course it's really just a movie.\n\n00:10:53.958 --> 00:10:55.958\nHere's Hedy Lamarr again.\n\n00:10:55.958 --> 00:10:58.958\nAnd, you know, this kind of head covering is extremely glamorous\n\n00:10:58.958 --> 00:11:02.958\nbecause, like sunglasses, it conceals and reveals at the same time.\n\n00:11:02.958 --> 00:11:04.958\nTranslucence is glamorous --\n\n00:11:04.958 --> 00:11:06.958\nthat's why all these people wear pearls.\n\n00:11:06.958 --> 00:11:10.958\nIt's why barware is glamorous. Glamour is translucent --\n\n00:11:10.958 --> 00:11:12.958\nnot transparent, not opaque.\n\n00:11:12.958 --> 00:11:14.958\nIt invites us into the world\n\n00:11:14.958 --> 00:11:18.958\nbut it doesn't give us a completely clear picture.\n\n00:11:18.958 --> 00:11:21.958\nAnd I think if Grace Kelly is the most glamorous person,\n\n00:11:21.958 --> 00:11:27.958\nmaybe a spiral staircase with glass block may be the most glamorous interior shot,\n\n00:11:27.958 --> 00:11:30.958\nbecause a spiral staircase is incredibly glamorous.\n\n00:11:30.958 --> 00:11:34.958\nIt has that sense of going up and away,\n\n00:11:34.958 --> 00:11:37.958\nand yet you never think about how you would really trip\n\n00:11:37.958 --> 00:11:39.958\nif you were -- particularly going down.\n\n00:11:39.958 --> 00:11:42.958\nAnd of course glass block has that sense of translucence.\n\n00:11:42.958 --> 00:11:46.958\nSo, this session's supposed to be about pure pleasure\n\n00:11:46.958 --> 00:11:49.958\nbut glamour's really partly about meaning.\n\n00:11:49.958 --> 00:11:52.958\nAll individuals and all cultures have ideals\n\n00:11:52.958 --> 00:11:56.958\nthat cannot possibly be realized in reality.\n\n00:11:56.958 --> 00:11:58.958\nThey have contradictions,\n\n00:11:58.958 --> 00:12:01.958\nthey uphold principles that are incommensurable with each other --\n\n00:12:01.958 --> 00:12:04.958\nwhatever it is -- and yet these ideals give meaning and purpose\n\n00:12:04.958 --> 00:12:07.958\nto our lives as cultures and as individuals.\n\n00:12:07.958 --> 00:12:11.958\nAnd the way we deal with that is we displace them --\n\n00:12:11.958 --> 00:12:14.958\nwe put them into a golden world, an imagined world,\n\n00:12:14.958 --> 00:12:17.958\nan age of heroes, the world to come.\n\n00:12:17.958 --> 00:12:21.958\nAnd in the life of an individual, we often associate that with some object.\n\n00:12:21.958 --> 00:12:25.958\nThe white picket fence, the perfect house.\n\n00:12:25.958 --> 00:12:28.958\nThe perfect kitchen -- no bills on the counter in the perfect kitchen.\n\n00:12:28.958 --> 00:12:31.958\nYou know, you buy that Viking range, this is what your kitchen will look like.\n\n00:12:31.958 --> 00:12:34.958\nThe perfect love life -- symbolized by the perfect necklace,\n\n00:12:34.958 --> 00:12:36.958\nthe perfect diamond ring.\n\n00:12:36.958 --> 00:12:38.958\nThe perfect getaway in your perfect car.\n\n00:12:38.958 --> 00:12:42.958\nThis is an interior design firm that is literally called Utopia.\n\n00:12:42.958 --> 00:12:44.958\nThe perfect office --\n\n00:12:44.958 --> 00:12:46.958\nagain, no cords, as far as I can tell.\n\n00:12:46.958 --> 00:12:49.958\nAnd certainly, no, it doesn't look a thing like my office.\n\n00:12:49.958 --> 00:12:51.958\nI mean, there's no paper on the desk.\n\n00:12:51.958 --> 00:12:53.958\nWe want this golden world.\n\n00:12:53.958 --> 00:12:55.958\nAnd some people get rich enough,\n\n00:12:55.958 --> 00:12:58.958\nand if they have their ideals -- in a sort of domestic sense,\n\n00:12:59.958 --> 00:13:01.958\nthey get to acquire their perfect world.\n\n00:13:01.958 --> 00:13:04.958\nDean Koontz built this fabulous home theater, which is --\n\n00:13:04.958 --> 00:13:08.958\nI don't think accidentally -- in Art Deco style.\n\n00:13:08.958 --> 00:13:11.958\nThat symbolizes this sense of being safe and at home.\n\n00:13:11.958 --> 00:13:14.958\nThis is not always good, because what is your perfect world?\n\n00:13:14.958 --> 00:13:17.958\nWhat is your ideal, and also, what has been edited out?\n\n00:13:17.958 --> 00:13:19.958\nIs it something important?\n\n00:13:19.958 --> 00:13:22.958\n\"The Matrix\" is a movie that is all about glamour.\n\n00:13:22.958 --> 00:13:24.958\nI could do a whole talk on \"The Matrix\" and glamour.\n\n00:13:24.958 --> 00:13:28.958\nIt was criticized for glamorizing violence,\n\n00:13:28.958 --> 00:13:33.958\nbecause, look -- sunglasses and those long coats, and, of course,\n\n00:13:33.958 --> 00:13:35.958\nthey could walk up walls and do all these kinds of things\n\n00:13:35.958 --> 00:13:37.958\nthat are impossible in the real world.\n\n00:13:37.958 --> 00:13:39.958\nThis is another Margaret Bourke-White photo.\n\n00:13:39.958 --> 00:13:41.958\nThis is from Soviet Union. Attractive.\n\n00:13:41.958 --> 00:13:45.958\nI mean, look how happy the people are, and good-looking too.\n\n00:13:45.958 --> 00:13:48.958\nYou know, we're marching toward Utopia.\n\n00:13:48.958 --> 00:13:51.958\nI'm not a fan of PETA, but I think this is a great ad.\n\n00:13:51.958 --> 00:13:53.958\nBecause what they're doing is they're saying,\n\n00:13:53.958 --> 00:13:57.958\nyour coat's not so glamorous, what's been edited out is something important.\n\n00:13:57.958 --> 00:13:59.958\nBut actually, what's even more important\n\n00:13:59.958 --> 00:14:03.958\nthan remembering what's been edited out is thinking, are the ideals good?\n\n00:14:03.958 --> 00:14:07.958\nBecause glamour can be very totalitarian and deceptive.\n\n00:14:07.958 --> 00:14:10.958\nAnd it's not just a matter of glamorizing cleaning your floor.\n\n00:14:10.958 --> 00:14:12.958\nThis is from \"Triumph Of The Will\" --\n\n00:14:12.958 --> 00:14:14.958\nbrilliant editing to cut together things.\n\n00:14:14.958 --> 00:14:16.958\nThere's a glamour shot.\n\n00:14:16.958 --> 00:14:18.958\nNational Socialism is all about glamour.\n\n00:14:18.958 --> 00:14:20.958\nIt was a very aesthetic ideology.\n\n00:14:20.958 --> 00:14:23.958\nIt was all about cleaning up Germany, and the West, and the world,\n\n00:14:23.958 --> 00:14:25.958\nand ridding it of anything unglamorous.\n\n00:14:25.958 --> 00:14:27.958\nSo glamour can be dangerous.\n\n00:14:27.958 --> 00:14:30.958\nI think glamour has a genuine appeal, has a genuine value.\n\n00:14:30.958 --> 00:14:32.958\nI'm not against glamour.\n\n00:14:32.958 --> 00:14:37.958\nBut there's a kind of wonder in the stuff that gets edited away in the cords of life.\n\n00:14:37.958 --> 00:14:41.958\nAnd there is both a way to avoid the dangers of glamour\n\n00:14:41.958 --> 00:14:43.958\nand a way to broaden your appreciation of it.\n\n00:14:43.958 --> 00:14:46.958\nAnd that's to take Isaac Mizrahi's advice\n\n00:14:46.958 --> 00:14:48.958\nand confront the manipulation of it all,\n\n00:14:48.958 --> 00:14:53.958\nand sort of admit that manipulation is something that we enjoy,\n\n00:14:53.958 --> 00:14:55.958\nbut also enjoy how it happens.\n\n00:14:55.958 --> 00:14:57.958\nAnd here's Hedy Lamarr.\n\n00:14:57.958 --> 00:15:00.958\nShe's very glamorous but, you know, she invented spread-spectrum technology.\n\n00:15:00.958 --> 00:15:03.958\nSo she's even more glamorous if you know that she really wasn't stupid,\n\n00:15:03.958 --> 00:15:05.958\neven though she thought she could look stupid.\n\n00:15:05.958 --> 00:15:09.958\nDavid Hockney talks about how the appreciation of this\n\n00:15:09.958 --> 00:15:12.958\nvery glamorous painting is heightened if you think about\n\n00:15:12.958 --> 00:15:16.958\nthe fact that it takes two weeks to paint this splash,\n\n00:15:16.958 --> 00:15:18.958\nwhich only took a fraction of a second to happen.\n\n00:15:18.958 --> 00:15:20.958\nThere is a book out in the bookstore --\n\n00:15:21.958 --> 00:15:23.958\nit's called \"Symphony In Steel,\"\n\n00:15:23.958 --> 00:15:26.958\nand it's about the stuff that's hidden under the skin of the Disney Center.\n\n00:15:26.958 --> 00:15:28.958\nAnd that has a fascination.\n\n00:15:28.958 --> 00:15:31.958\nIt's not necessarily glamorous, but unveiling the glamour has an appeal.\n\n00:15:31.958 --> 00:15:34.958\nThere's a wonderful book called \"Crowns\"\n\n00:15:34.958 --> 00:15:38.958\nthat's all these glamour pictures of black women in their church hats.\n\n00:15:38.958 --> 00:15:41.958\nAnd there's a quote from one of these women, and she talks about,\n\n00:15:41.958 --> 00:15:44.958\n\"As a little girl, I'd admire women at church with beautiful hats.\n\n00:15:44.958 --> 00:15:48.958\nThey looked like beautiful dolls, like they'd just stepped out of a magazine.\n\n00:15:48.958 --> 00:15:51.958\nBut I also knew how hard they worked all week.\n\n00:15:51.958 --> 00:15:55.958\nSometimes under those hats there's a lot of joy and a lot of sorrow.\"\n\n00:15:55.958 --> 00:15:58.958\nAnd, actually, you get more appreciation for glamour\n\n00:15:58.958 --> 00:16:01.958\nwhen you realize what went into creating it.\n\n00:16:01.958 --> 00:16:02.958\nThank you."}, {"title": "Healing through diet", "duration": "1009", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/dean_ornish_on_healing", "transcript": "This session is on natural wonders, and the bigger conference is on the pursuit of happiness. I want to try to combine them all, because to me, healing is really the ultimate natural wonder. Your body has a remarkable capacity to begin healing itself, and much more quickly than people had once realized, if you simply stop doing what\u2019s causing the problem. And so, really, so much of what we do in medicine and life in general is focused on mopping up the floor without also turning off the faucet.I love doing this work, because it really gives many people new hope and new choices that they didn\u2019t have before, and it allows us to talk about things that \u2014 not just diet, but that happiness is not \u2014 we're talking about the pursuit of happiness, but when you really look at all the spiritual traditions, what Aldous Huxley called the \"perennial wisdom,\" when you get past the named and forms and rituals that really divide people, it\u2019s really about \u2014 our nature is to be happy; our nature is to be peaceful, our nature is to be healthy. And so it\u2019s not something \u2014 happiness is not something you get, health is generally not something that you get. But rather all of these different practices \u2014 you know, the ancient swamis and rabbis and priests and monks and nuns didn\u2019t develop these techniques to just manage stress or lower your blood pressure, unclog your arteries, even though it can do all those things. They\u2019re powerful tools for transformation, for quieting down our mind and bodies to allow us to experience what it feels like to be happy, to be peaceful, to be joyful and to realize that it\u2019s not something that you pursue and get, but rather it\u2019s something that you have already until you disturb it.I studied yoga for many years with a teacher named Swami Satchidananda and people would say, \"What are you, a Hindu?\" He\u2019d say, \"No, I\u2019m an undo.\" And it\u2019s really about identifying what\u2019s causing us to disturb our innate health and happiness, and then to allow that natural healing to occur. To me, that\u2019s the real natural wonder.So, within that larger context, we can talk about diet, stress management \u2014 which are really these spiritual practices \u2014 moderate exercise, smoking cessation, support groups and community \u2014 which I\u2019ll talk more about \u2014 and some vitamins and supplements. And it\u2019s not a diet. You know, when most people think about the diet I recommend, they think it\u2019s a really strict diet. For reversing disease, that\u2019s what it takes, but if you\u2019re just trying to be healthy, you have a spectrum of choices. And to the degree that you can move in a healthy direction, you\u2019re going to live longer, you\u2019re going to feel better, you\u2019re going to lose weight, and so on. And in our studies, what we\u2019ve been able to do is to use very expensive, high-tech, state-of-the-art measures to prove how powerful these very simple and low-tech and low-cost \u2014 and in many ways, ancient \u2014 interventions, can be.We first began by looking at heart disease, and when I began doing this work 26 or 27 years ago, it was thought that once you have heart disease it can only get worse. And what we found was that, instead of getting worse and worse, in many cases it could get better and better, and much more quickly than people had once realized.This is a representative patient who at the time was 73 \u2014 totally needed to have a bypass, decided to do this instead. We used quantitative arteriography, showing the narrowing. This is one of the arteries that feed the heart, one of the main arteries, and you can see the narrowing here. A year later, it\u2019s not as clogged; normally, it goes the other direction. These minor changes in blockages caused a 300 percent improvement in blood flow, and using cardiac positron emission tomography, or \"PET,\" scans, blue and black is no blood flow, orange and white is maximal.Huge differences can occur without drugs, without surgery. Clinically, he literally couldn\u2019t walk across the street without getting severe chest pain; within a month, like most people, was pain-free, and within a year, climbing more than 100 floors a day on a Stairmaster. This is not unusual, and it\u2019s part of what enables people to maintain these kinds of changes, because it makes such a big difference in their quality of life. Overall, if you looked at all the arteries in all the patients, they got worse and worse, from one year to five years, in the comparison group. This is the natural history of heart disease, but it\u2019s really not natural because we found it could get better and better, and much more quickly than people had once thought. We also found that the more people change, the better they got. It wasn\u2019t a function of how old or how sick they were \u2014 it was mainly how much they changed, and the oldest patients improved as much as the young ones.I got this as a Christmas card a few years ago from two of the patients in one of our programs. The younger brother is 86, the older one\u2019s 95; they wanted to show me how much more flexible they were. And the following year they sent me this one, which I thought was kind of funny. (Laughter) You just never know. And what we found was that 99 percent of the patients start to reverse the progression of their heart disease. Now I thought, you know, if we just did good science, that would change medical practice. But, that was a little naive. It\u2019s important, but not enough. Because we doctors do what we get paid to do, and we get trained to do what we get paid to do, so if we change insurance, then we change medical practice and medical education. Insurance will cover the bypass, it\u2019ll cover the angioplasty; it won\u2019t, until recently, cover diet and lifestyle.So, we began through our nonprofit institute's training hospitals around the country, and we found that most people could avoid surgery, and not only was it medically effective, it was also cost effective. And the insurance companies found that they began to save almost 30,000 dollars per patient, and Medicare is now in the middle of doing a demonstration project where they\u2019re paying for 1,800 people to go through the program on the sites that we train. The fortuneteller says, \"I give smokers a discount because there\u2019s not as much to tell.\" (Laughter) I like this slide, because it\u2019s a chance to talk about what really motivates people to change, and what doesn\u2019t. And what doesn\u2019t work is fear of dying, and that\u2019s what\u2019s normally used.Everybody who smokes knows it\u2019s not good for you, and still 30 percent of Americans smoke \u2014 80 percent in some parts of the world. Why do people do it? Well, because it helps them get through the day. And I\u2019ll talk more about this, but the real epidemic isn\u2019t just heart disease or obesity or smoking \u2014 it\u2019s loneliness and depression. As one woman said, \"I\u2019ve got 20 friends in this package of cigarettes, and they\u2019re always there for me and nobody else is. You\u2019re going to take away my 20 friends? What are you going to give me?\" Or they eat when they get depressed, or they use alcohol to numb the pain, or they work too hard, or watch too much TV. There are lots of ways we have of avoiding and numbing and bypassing pain, but the point of all of this is to deal with the cause of the problem. And the pain is not the problem: it\u2019s the symptom. And telling people they\u2019re going to die is too scary to think about, or, they\u2019re going to get emphysema or heart attack is too scary, and so they don\u2019t want to think about it, so they don\u2019t.The most effective anti-smoking ad was this one. You\u2019ll notice the limp cigarette hanging out of his mouth, and \"impotence\" \u2014 the headline is, \"Impotent\" \u2014 it\u2019s not emphysema. What was the biggest selling drug of all time when it was introduced a few years ago? Viagra, right? Why? Because a lot of guys need it. It\u2019s not like you say, \"Hey Joe, I\u2019m having erectile dysfunction, how about you?\" And yet, look at the number of prescriptions that are being sold. It\u2019s not so much psychological, it\u2019s vascular, and nicotine makes your arteries constrict. So does cocaine, so does a high fat diet, so does emotional stress.So the very behaviors that we think of as being so sexy in our culture are the very ones that leave so many people feeling tired, lethargic, depressed and impotent, and that\u2019s not much fun. But when you change those behaviors, your brain gets more blood, you think more clearly, you have more energy, your heart gets more blood in ways I\u2019ve shown you. Your sexual function improves. And these things occur within hours. This is a study: a high fat meal, and within one or two hours blood-flow is measurably less \u2014 and you\u2019ve all experienced this at Thanksgiving. When you eat a big fatty meal, how do you feel? You feel kind of sleepy afterwards. On a low-fat meal, the blood flow doesn\u2019t go down \u2014 it even goes up. Many of you have kids, and you know that\u2019s a big change in your lifestyle, and so people are not afraid to make big changes in lifestyle if they\u2019re worth it. And the paradox is that when you make big changes, you get big benefits, and you feel so much better so quickly. For many people, those are choices worth making \u2014 not to live longer, but to live better.I want to talk a little bit about the obesity epidemic, because it really is a problem. Two-thirds of adults are overweight or obese, and diabetes in kids and 30-year-olds has increased 70 percent in the last 10 years. It\u2019s no joke: it\u2019s real. And just to show you this, this is from the CDC. These are not election returns; these are the percentage of people who are overweight. And if you see from '85 to '86 to '87, '88, '89, '90, '91 \u2014 you get a new category, 15 to 20 percent; '92, '93, '94, '95, '96, '97 \u2014 you get a new category; '98, '99, 2000, and 2001. Mississippi, more than 25 percent of people are overweight. Why is this? Well, this is one way to lose weight that works very well ... but it doesn\u2019t last, which is the problem.(Laughter)Now, there\u2019s no mystery in how you lose weight; you either burn more calories by exercise or you eat fewer calories. Now, one way to eat fewer calories is to eat less food, which is why you can lose weight on any diet if you eat less food, or if you restrict entire categories of foods. But the problem is, you get hungry, so it\u2019s hard to keep it off. The other way is to change the type of food. And fat has nine calories per gram, whereas protein and carbs only have four. So, when you eat less fat, you eat fewer calories without having to eat less food. So you can eat the same amount of food, but you\u2019ll be getting fewer calories because the food is less dense in calories. And it\u2019s the volume of food that affects satiety, rather than the type of food.You know, I don\u2019t like talking about the Atkins diet, but I get asked about it every day, and so I just thought I\u2019d spend a few minutes on that. The myth that you hear about is, Americans have been told to eat less fat, the percent of calories from fat is down, Americans are fatter than ever, therefore fat doesn\u2019t make you fat. It\u2019s a half-truth. Actually, Americans are eating more fat than ever, and even more carbs. And so the percentage is lower, the actual amount is higher, and so the goal is to reduce both. Dr. Atkins and I debated each other many times before he died, and we agreed that Americans eat too many simple carbs, the \"bad carbs,\" and these are things like \u2014 (Laughter) \u2014 sugar, white flour, white rice, alcohol. And you get a double whammy: you get all these calories that don\u2019t fill you up because you\u2019ve removed the fiber, and they get absorbed quickly so your blood sugar zooms up. Your pancreas makes insulin to bring it back down, which is good. But insulin accelerates the conversion of calories into fat. So, the goal is not to go to pork rinds and bacon and sausages \u2014 these are not health foods \u2014 but to go from \"bad carbs\" to what are called \"good carbs.\" And these are things like whole foods, or unrefined carbs: fruits, vegetables, whole wheat flour, brown rice, in their natural forms, are rich in fiber. And the fiber fills you up before you get too many calories, and it slows the absorption so you don\u2019t get that rapid rise in blood sugar. So, and you get all the disease-protective substances.It\u2019s not just what you exclude from your diet, but also what you include that\u2019s protective. Just as all carbs are not bad for you, all fats are not bad for you. There are good fats. And these are predominantly what are called the Omega-3 fatty acids. You find these, for example, in fish oil. And the bad fats are things like trans-fatty acids and processed food and saturated fats, which we find in meat. If you don\u2019t remember anything else from this talk, three grams a day of fish oil can reduce your risk of a heart attack and sudden death by 50 to 80 percent. Three grams a day. They come in one-gram capsules; more than that just gives you extra fat you don\u2019t need. It also helps reduce the risk of the most common cancers like breast, prostate and colon cancer. Now, the problem with the Atkins diet, everybody knows people who have lost weight on it, but you can lose weight on amphetamines, you know, and fen-phen. I mean, there are lots of ways of losing weight that aren\u2019t good for you. You want to lose weight in a way that enhances your health rather than the one that harms it. And the problem is that it\u2019s based on this half-truth, which is that Americans eat too many simple carbs, so if you eat fewer simple carbs you\u2019re going to lose weight. You\u2019ll lose even more weight if you go to whole foods and less fat, and you\u2019ll enhance your health rather than harming it. He says, \"I\u2019ve got some good news. While your cholesterol level has remained the same, the research findings have changed.\"(Laughter)Now, what happens to your heart when you go on an Atkins diet? The red is good at the beginning, and a year later \u2014 this is from a study done in a peer-reviewed journal called Angiology \u2014 there\u2019s more red after a year on a diet like I would recommend, there\u2019s less red, less blood flow after a year on an Atkins-type diet. So, yes, you can lose weight, but your heart isn\u2019t happy. Now, one of the studies funded by the Atkins Center found that 70 percent of the people were constipated, 65 percent had bad breath, 54 percent had headaches \u2013 this is not a healthy way to eat. And so, you might start to lose weight and start to attract people towards you, but when they get too close it\u2019s going to be a problem.(Laughter)And more seriously, there are case reports now of 16-year-old girls who died after a few weeks on the Atkins diet \u2014 of bone disease, kidney disease, and so on. And that\u2019s how your body excretes waste, is through your breath, your bowels and your perspiration. So when you go on these kinds of diet, they begin to smell bad. So, an optimal diet is low in fat, low in the bad carbs, high in the good carbs and enough of the good fats. And then, again, it\u2019s a spectrum: when you move in this direction, you\u2019re going to lose weight, you\u2019re going to feel better and you\u2019re going to gain health.Now, there are ecological reasons for eating lower on the food chain too, whether it\u2019s the deforestation of the Amazon, or making more protein available, to the four billion people who live on a dollar a day \u2014 not to mention whatever ethical concerns people have. So, there are lots of reasons for eating this way that go beyond just your health.Now, we\u2019re about to publish the first study looking at the effects of this program on prostate cancer, and, in collaboration with Sloane-Kettering and with UCSF. We took 90 men who had biopsy-proven prostate cancer and who had elected, for reasons unrelated to the study, not to have surgery. We could randomly divide them into two groups, and then we could have one group that is a non-intervention control group to compare to, which we can\u2019t do with, say, breast cancer, because everyone gets treated.What we found was that, after a year, none of the experimental group patients who made these lifestyle changes needed treatment, whereas six of the control-group patients needed surgery or radiation. When we looked at their PSA levels \u2014 which is a marker for prostate cancer \u2014 they got worse in the control group, but they actually got better in the experimental group, and these differences were highly significant.And then I wondered: was there any relationship between how much people changed their diet and lifestyle \u2014 whichever group they were in \u2014 and the changes in PSA? And sure enough, we found a dose-response relationship, just like we found in the arterial blockages in our cardiac studies. And in order for the PSA to go down, they had to make pretty big changes.I then wondered, well, maybe they\u2019re just changing their PSA, but it\u2019s not really affecting the tumor growth. So we took some of their blood serum and sent it down to UCLA; they added it to a standard line of prostate tumor cells growing in tissue culture, and it inhibited the growth seven times more in the experimental group than in the control group \u2014 70 versus 9 percent. And finally, I said, I wonder if there\u2019s any relationship between how much people change and how it inhibited their tumor growth, whichever group they happened to be in. And this really got me excited because again, we found the same pattern: the more people change, the more it affected the growth of their tumors. And finally, we did MRI and MR spectroscopy scans on some of these patients, and the tumor activity is shown in red in this patient, and you can see clearly it\u2019s better a year later, along with the PSA going down. So, if it\u2019s true for prostate cancer, it\u2019ll almost certainly be true for breast cancer as well. And whether or not you have conventional treatment, in addition, if you make these changes, it may help reduce the risk of recurrence.The last thing I want to talk about, apropos of the issue of the pursuit of happiness, is that study after study have shown that people who are lonely and depressed \u2014 and depression is the other real epidemic in our culture \u2014 are many times more likely to get sick and die prematurely, in part because, as we talked about, they\u2019re more likely to smoke and overeat and drink too much and work too hard and so on. But also, through mechanisms that we don\u2019t fully understand, people who are lonely and depressed are many times \u2014 three to five to ten times, in some studies \u2014 more likely to get sick and die prematurely. And depression is treatable. We need to do something about that.Now, on the other hand, anything that promotes intimacy is healing. It can be sexual intimacy \u2013 I happen to think that healing energy and erotic energy are just different forms of the same thing. Friendship, altruism, compassion, service \u2013 all the perennial truths that we talked about that are part of all religion and all cultures \u2014 once you stop trying to see the differences, these are the things in our own self-interest, because they free us from our suffering and from disease. And it\u2019s in a sense the most selfish thing that we can do.Just take a look at one study. This was done by David Spiegel at Stanford. He took women with metastatic breast cancer, randomly divided them into two groups. One group of people just met for an hour-and-a-half once a week in a support group. It was a nurturing, loving environment, where they were encouraged to let down their emotional defenses and talk about how awful it is to have breast cancer with people who understood, because they were going through it too. They just met once a week for a year. Five years later, those women lived twice as long, and you can see that the people \u2014 and that was the only difference between the groups. It was a randomized control study published in The Lancet. Other studies have shown this as well. So, these simple things that create intimacy are really healing, and even the word healing, it comes from the root \"to make whole.\" The word yoga comes from the Sanskrit, meaning \"union, to yoke, to bring together.\"And the last slide I want to show you is from \u2014 I was \u2014 again, this swami that I studied with for so many years, and I did a combined oncology and cardiology Grand Rounds at the University of Virginia medical school a couple of years ago. And at the end of it, somebody said, \"Hey, Swami, what\u2019s the difference between wellness and illness?\" And so he went up on the board and he wrote the word \"illness,\" and circled the first letter, and then wrote the word \"wellness,\" and circled the first two letters ... To me, it\u2019s just shorthand for what we\u2019re talking about: that anything that creates a sense of connection and community and love is really healing. And then we can enjoy our lives more fully without getting sick in the process. Thank you.

00:00:16.958\nand the bigger conference is on the pursuit of happiness.\n\n00:00:16.958 --> 00:00:17.958\nI want to try to combine them all,\n\n00:00:17.958 --> 00:00:20.958\nbecause to me, healing is really the ultimate natural wonder.\n\n00:00:20.958 --> 00:00:24.958\nYour body has a remarkable capacity to begin healing itself,\n\n00:00:24.958 --> 00:00:27.958\nand much more quickly than people had once realized,\n\n00:00:27.958 --> 00:00:30.958\nif you simply stop doing what\u2019s causing the problem.\n\n00:00:30.958 --> 00:00:34.958\nAnd so, really, so much of what we do in medicine and life in general\n\n00:00:34.958 --> 00:00:38.958\nis focused on mopping up the floor without also turning off the faucet.\n\n00:00:38.958 --> 00:00:42.958\nI love doing this work, because it really gives many people\n\n00:00:42.958 --> 00:00:44.958\nnew hope and new choices that they didn\u2019t have before,\n\n00:00:44.958 --> 00:00:49.958\nand it allows us to talk about things that -- not just diet,\n\n00:00:49.958 --> 00:00:51.958\nbut that happiness is not --\n\n00:00:51.958 --> 00:00:53.958\nwe're talking about the pursuit of happiness,\n\n00:00:53.958 --> 00:00:55.958\nbut when you really look at all the spiritual traditions,\n\n00:00:55.958 --> 00:00:58.958\nwhat Aldous Huxley called the \"perennial wisdom,\"\n\n00:00:58.958 --> 00:01:02.958\nwhen you get past the named and forms and rituals that really divide people,\n\n00:01:02.958 --> 00:01:04.958\nit\u2019s really about -- our nature is to be happy;\n\n00:01:04.958 --> 00:01:07.958\nour nature is to be peaceful, our nature is to be healthy.\n\n00:01:07.958 --> 00:01:10.958\nAnd so it\u2019s not something -- happiness is not something you get,\n\n00:01:10.958 --> 00:01:12.958\nhealth is generally not something that you get.\n\n00:01:12.958 --> 00:01:15.958\nBut rather all of these different practices --\n\n00:01:15.958 --> 00:01:18.958\nyou know, the ancient swamis and rabbis and priests and monks and nuns\n\n00:01:18.958 --> 00:01:21.958\ndidn\u2019t develop these techniques to just manage stress\n\n00:01:21.958 --> 00:01:23.958\nor lower your blood pressure, unclog your arteries,\n\n00:01:23.958 --> 00:01:25.958\neven though it can do all those things.\n\n00:01:25.958 --> 00:01:27.958\nThey\u2019re powerful tools for transformation,\n\n00:01:27.958 --> 00:01:30.958\nfor quieting down our mind and bodies\n\n00:01:30.958 --> 00:01:33.958\nto allow us to experience what it feels like to be happy,\n\n00:01:33.958 --> 00:01:35.958\nto be peaceful, to be joyful\n\n00:01:35.958 --> 00:01:38.958\nand to realize that it\u2019s not something that you pursue and get,\n\n00:01:38.958 --> 00:01:42.958\nbut rather it\u2019s something that you have already until you disturb it.\n\n00:01:42.958 --> 00:01:46.958\nI studied yoga for many years with a teacher named Swami Satchidananda\n\n00:01:46.958 --> 00:01:49.958\nand people would say, \"What are you, a Hindu?\" He\u2019d say, \"No, I\u2019m an undo.\"\n\n00:01:49.958 --> 00:01:52.958\nAnd it\u2019s really about identifying what\u2019s causing us\n\n00:01:52.958 --> 00:01:55.958\nto disturb our innate health and happiness,\n\n00:01:55.958 --> 00:01:58.958\nand then to allow that natural healing to occur.\n\n00:01:58.958 --> 00:02:00.958\nTo me, that\u2019s the real natural wonder.\n\n00:02:00.958 --> 00:02:02.958\nSo, within that larger context,\n\n00:02:02.958 --> 00:02:05.958\nwe can talk about diet, stress management --\n\n00:02:05.958 --> 00:02:07.958\nwhich are really these spiritual practices --\n\n00:02:07.958 --> 00:02:11.958\nmoderate exercise, smoking cessation, support groups and community --\n\n00:02:11.958 --> 00:02:13.958\nwhich I\u2019ll talk more about -- and some vitamins and supplements.\n\n00:02:13.958 --> 00:02:15.958\nAnd it\u2019s not a diet.\n\n00:02:15.958 --> 00:02:17.958\nYou know, when most people think about the diet I recommend,\n\n00:02:17.958 --> 00:02:19.958\nthey think it\u2019s a really strict diet.\n\n00:02:19.958 --> 00:02:21.958\nFor reversing disease, that\u2019s what it takes,\n\n00:02:21.958 --> 00:02:23.958\nbut if you\u2019re just trying to be healthy, you have a spectrum of choices.\n\n00:02:23.958 --> 00:02:26.958\nAnd to the degree that you can move in a healthy direction,\n\n00:02:26.958 --> 00:02:28.958\nyou\u2019re going to live longer, you\u2019re going to feel better,\n\n00:02:28.958 --> 00:02:30.958\nyou\u2019re going to lose weight, and so on.\n\n00:02:30.958 --> 00:02:32.958\nAnd in our studies, what we\u2019ve been able to do\n\n00:02:32.958 --> 00:02:35.958\nis to use very expensive, high-tech, state-of-the-art measures\n\n00:02:35.958 --> 00:02:39.958\nto prove how powerful these very simple and low-tech and low-cost --\n\n00:02:39.958 --> 00:02:42.958\nand in many ways, ancient -- interventions, can be.\n\n00:02:42.958 --> 00:02:44.958\nWe first began by looking at heart disease,\n\n00:02:44.958 --> 00:02:47.958\nand when I began doing this work 26 or 27 years ago,\n\n00:02:47.958 --> 00:02:51.958\nit was thought that once you have heart disease it can only get worse.\n\n00:02:51.958 --> 00:02:53.958\nAnd what we found was that, instead of getting worse and worse,\n\n00:02:53.958 --> 00:02:55.958\nin many cases it could get better and better,\n\n00:02:55.958 --> 00:02:58.958\nand much more quickly than people had once realized.\n\n00:02:58.958 --> 00:03:01.958\nThis is a representative patient who at the time was 73 --\n\n00:03:01.958 --> 00:03:04.958\ntotally needed to have a bypass, decided to do this instead.\n\n00:03:04.958 --> 00:03:07.958\nWe used quantitative arteriography, showing the narrowing.\n\n00:03:07.958 --> 00:03:10.958\nThis is one of the arteries that feed the heart, one of the main arteries,\n\n00:03:10.958 --> 00:03:12.958\nand you can see the narrowing here.\n\n00:03:12.958 --> 00:03:15.958\nA year later, it\u2019s not as clogged; normally, it goes the other direction.\n\n00:03:15.958 --> 00:03:17.958\nThese minor changes in blockages\n\n00:03:17.958 --> 00:03:19.958\ncaused a 300 percent improvement in blood flow,\n\n00:03:19.958 --> 00:03:23.958\nand using cardiac positron emission tomography, or \"PET,\" scans,\n\n00:03:23.958 --> 00:03:26.958\nblue and black is no blood flow, orange and white is maximal.\n\n00:03:26.958 --> 00:03:30.958\nHuge differences can occur without drugs, without surgery.\n\n00:03:30.958 --> 00:03:34.958\nClinically, he literally couldn\u2019t walk across the street without getting severe chest pain;\n\n00:03:34.958 --> 00:03:37.958\nwithin a month, like most people, was pain-free, and within a year,\n\n00:03:37.958 --> 00:03:39.958\nclimbing more than 100 floors a day on a Stairmaster.\n\n00:03:39.958 --> 00:03:42.958\nThis is not unusual, and it\u2019s part of what enables people\n\n00:03:42.958 --> 00:03:44.958\nto maintain these kinds of changes,\n\n00:03:44.958 --> 00:03:46.958\nbecause it makes such a big difference in their quality of life.\n\n00:03:46.958 --> 00:03:49.958\nOverall, if you looked at all the arteries in all the patients,\n\n00:03:49.958 --> 00:03:52.958\nthey got worse and worse, from one year to five years, in the comparison group.\n\n00:03:52.958 --> 00:03:54.958\nThis is the natural history of heart disease,\n\n00:03:54.958 --> 00:03:58.958\nbut it\u2019s really not natural because we found it could get better and better,\n\n00:03:58.958 --> 00:04:00.958\nand much more quickly than people had once thought.\n\n00:04:00.958 --> 00:04:03.958\nWe also found that the more people change, the better they got.\n\n00:04:03.958 --> 00:04:06.958\nIt wasn\u2019t a function of how old or how sick they were --\n\n00:04:06.958 --> 00:04:08.958\nit was mainly how much they changed,\n\n00:04:08.958 --> 00:04:10.958\nand the oldest patients improved as much as the young ones.\n\n00:04:10.958 --> 00:04:12.958\nI got this as a Christmas card a few years ago\n\n00:04:12.958 --> 00:04:14.958\nfrom two of the patients in one of our programs.\n\n00:04:14.958 --> 00:04:17.958\nThe younger brother is 86, the older one\u2019s 95;\n\n00:04:17.958 --> 00:04:19.958\nthey wanted to show me how much more flexible they were.\n\n00:04:19.958 --> 00:04:21.958\nAnd the following year they sent me this one, which I thought was kind of funny.\n\n00:04:21.958 --> 00:04:23.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:04:23.958 --> 00:04:25.958\nYou just never know.\n\n00:04:25.958 --> 00:04:27.958\nAnd what we found was that 99 percent of the patients\n\n00:04:27.958 --> 00:04:30.958\nstart to reverse the progression of their heart disease.\n\n00:04:30.958 --> 00:04:32.958\nNow I thought, you know, if we just did good science,\n\n00:04:32.958 --> 00:04:34.958\nthat would change medical practice. But, that was a little naive.\n\n00:04:34.958 --> 00:04:36.958\nIt\u2019s important, but not enough.\n\n00:04:36.958 --> 00:04:38.958\nBecause we doctors do what we get paid to do,\n\n00:04:38.958 --> 00:04:40.958\nand we get trained to do what we get paid to do,\n\n00:04:40.958 --> 00:04:44.958\nso if we change insurance, then we change medical practice and medical education.\n\n00:04:44.958 --> 00:04:46.958\nInsurance will cover the bypass, it\u2019ll cover the angioplasty;\n\n00:04:46.958 --> 00:04:49.958\nit won\u2019t, until recently, cover diet and lifestyle.\n\n00:04:49.958 --> 00:04:51.958\nSo, we began through our nonprofit institute's\n\n00:04:51.958 --> 00:04:53.958\ntraining hospitals around the country,\n\n00:04:53.958 --> 00:04:56.958\nand we found that most people could avoid surgery,\n\n00:04:56.958 --> 00:04:58.958\nand not only was it medically effective, it was also cost effective.\n\n00:04:58.958 --> 00:05:00.958\nAnd the insurance companies found\n\n00:05:00.958 --> 00:05:03.958\nthat they began to save almost 30,000 dollars per patient,\n\n00:05:03.958 --> 00:05:06.958\nand Medicare is now in the middle of doing a demonstration project\n\n00:05:06.958 --> 00:05:08.958\nwhere they\u2019re paying for 1,800 people to go through the program\n\n00:05:08.958 --> 00:05:10.958\non the sites that we train.\n\n00:05:10.958 --> 00:05:12.958\nThe fortuneteller says, \"I give smokers a discount\n\n00:05:12.958 --> 00:05:15.958\nbecause there\u2019s not as much to tell.\" (Laughter)\n\n00:05:15.958 --> 00:05:19.958\nI like this slide, because it\u2019s a chance to talk about\n\n00:05:19.958 --> 00:05:21.958\nwhat really motivates people to change, and what doesn\u2019t.\n\n00:05:21.958 --> 00:05:23.958\nAnd what doesn\u2019t work is fear of dying,\n\n00:05:23.958 --> 00:05:25.958\nand that\u2019s what\u2019s normally used.\n\n00:05:25.958 --> 00:05:27.958\nEverybody who smokes knows it\u2019s not good for you,\n\n00:05:27.958 --> 00:05:29.958\nand still 30 percent of Americans smoke --\n\n00:05:29.958 --> 00:05:32.958\n80 percent in some parts of the world. Why do people do it?\n\n00:05:32.958 --> 00:05:34.958\nWell, because it helps them get through the day.\n\n00:05:34.958 --> 00:05:37.958\nAnd I\u2019ll talk more about this, but the real epidemic\n\n00:05:37.958 --> 00:05:40.958\nisn\u2019t just heart disease or obesity or smoking -- it\u2019s loneliness and depression.\n\n00:05:40.958 --> 00:05:44.958\nAs one woman said, \"I\u2019ve got 20 friends in this package of cigarettes,\n\n00:05:44.958 --> 00:05:46.958\nand they\u2019re always there for me and nobody else is.\n\n00:05:46.958 --> 00:05:48.958\nYou\u2019re going to take away my 20 friends? What are you going to give me?\"\n\n00:05:48.958 --> 00:05:50.958\nOr they eat when they get depressed,\n\n00:05:50.958 --> 00:05:52.958\nor they use alcohol to numb the pain,\n\n00:05:52.958 --> 00:05:54.958\nor they work too hard, or watch too much TV.\n\n00:05:54.958 --> 00:05:58.958\nThere are lots of ways we have of avoiding and numbing and bypassing pain,\n\n00:05:58.958 --> 00:06:01.958\nbut the point of all of this is to deal with the cause of the problem.\n\n00:06:01.958 --> 00:06:03.958\nAnd the pain is not the problem: it\u2019s the symptom.\n\n00:06:03.958 --> 00:06:07.958\nAnd telling people they\u2019re going to die is too scary to think about,\n\n00:06:07.958 --> 00:06:09.958\nor, they\u2019re going to get emphysema or heart attack is too scary,\n\n00:06:09.958 --> 00:06:12.958\nand so they don\u2019t want to think about it, so they don\u2019t.\n\n00:06:12.958 --> 00:06:14.958\nThe most effective anti-smoking ad was this one.\n\n00:06:14.958 --> 00:06:17.958\nYou\u2019ll notice the limp cigarette hanging out of his mouth,\n\n00:06:17.958 --> 00:06:20.958\nand \"impotence\" -- the headline is, \"Impotent\" -- it\u2019s not emphysema.\n\n00:06:20.958 --> 00:06:22.958\nWhat was the biggest selling drug of all time\n\n00:06:22.958 --> 00:06:24.958\nwhen it was introduced a few years ago?\n\n00:06:24.958 --> 00:06:27.958\nViagra, right? Why? Because a lot of guys need it.\n\n00:06:27.958 --> 00:06:30.958\nIt\u2019s not like you say, \"Hey Joe, I\u2019m having erectile dysfunction, how about you?\"\n\n00:06:30.958 --> 00:06:33.958\nAnd yet, look at the number of prescriptions that are being sold.\n\n00:06:33.958 --> 00:06:36.958\nIt\u2019s not so much psychological, it\u2019s vascular,\n\n00:06:36.958 --> 00:06:38.958\nand nicotine makes your arteries constrict.\n\n00:06:38.958 --> 00:06:42.958\nSo does cocaine, so does a high fat diet, so does emotional stress.\n\n00:06:42.958 --> 00:06:46.958\nSo the very behaviors that we think of as being so sexy in our culture\n\n00:06:46.958 --> 00:06:48.958\nare the very ones that leave so many people feeling tired,\n\n00:06:48.958 --> 00:06:51.958\nlethargic, depressed and impotent, and that\u2019s not much fun.\n\n00:06:51.958 --> 00:06:53.958\nBut when you change those behaviors, your brain gets more blood,\n\n00:06:53.958 --> 00:06:55.958\nyou think more clearly, you have more energy,\n\n00:06:55.958 --> 00:06:57.958\nyour heart gets more blood in ways I\u2019ve shown you.\n\n00:06:57.958 --> 00:06:59.958\nYour sexual function improves.\n\n00:06:59.958 --> 00:07:03.958\nAnd these things occur within hours. This is a study: a high fat meal,\n\n00:07:03.958 --> 00:07:05.958\nand within one or two hours blood-flow is measurably less --\n\n00:07:05.958 --> 00:07:07.958\nand you\u2019ve all experienced this at Thanksgiving.\n\n00:07:07.958 --> 00:07:09.958\nWhen you eat a big fatty meal, how do you feel?\n\n00:07:09.958 --> 00:07:11.958\nYou feel kind of sleepy afterwards.\n\n00:07:11.958 --> 00:07:14.958\nOn a low-fat meal, the blood flow doesn\u2019t go down -- it even goes up.\n\n00:07:14.958 --> 00:07:18.958\nMany of you have kids, and you know that\u2019s a big change in your lifestyle,\n\n00:07:18.958 --> 00:07:22.958\nand so people are not afraid to make big changes in lifestyle if they\u2019re worth it.\n\n00:07:22.958 --> 00:07:25.958\nAnd the paradox is that when you make big changes, you get big benefits,\n\n00:07:25.958 --> 00:07:28.958\nand you feel so much better so quickly.\n\n00:07:28.958 --> 00:07:30.958\nFor many people, those are choices worth making --\n\n00:07:30.958 --> 00:07:33.958\nnot to live longer, but to live better.\n\n00:07:33.958 --> 00:07:35.958\nI want to talk a little bit about the obesity epidemic,\n\n00:07:35.958 --> 00:07:37.958\nbecause it really is a problem.\n\n00:07:37.958 --> 00:07:40.958\nTwo-thirds of adults are overweight or obese,\n\n00:07:40.958 --> 00:07:42.958\nand diabetes in kids and 30-year-olds\n\n00:07:42.958 --> 00:07:46.958\nhas increased 70 percent in the last 10 years. It\u2019s no joke: it\u2019s real.\n\n00:07:46.958 --> 00:07:49.958\nAnd just to show you this, this is from the CDC.\n\n00:07:49.958 --> 00:07:52.958\nThese are not election returns; these are the percentage of people who are overweight.\n\n00:07:52.958 --> 00:07:59.958\nAnd if you see from '85 to '86 to '87, '88, '89, '90, '91 --\n\n00:07:59.958 --> 00:08:06.958\nyou get a new category, 15 to 20 percent; '92, '93, '94, '95, '96, '97 --\n\n00:08:06.958 --> 00:08:11.958\nyou get a new category; '98, '99, 2000, and 2001.\n\n00:08:11.958 --> 00:08:15.958\nMississippi, more than 25 percent of people are overweight.\n\n00:08:15.958 --> 00:08:18.958\nWhy is this? Well, this is one way to lose weight that works very well ...\n\n00:08:18.958 --> 00:08:20.958\nbut it doesn\u2019t last, which is the problem.\n\n00:08:20.958 --> 00:08:22.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:08:22.958 --> 00:08:24.958\nNow, there\u2019s no mystery in how you lose weight;\n\n00:08:24.958 --> 00:08:28.958\nyou either burn more calories by exercise or you eat fewer calories.\n\n00:08:28.958 --> 00:08:31.958\nNow, one way to eat fewer calories is to eat less food,\n\n00:08:31.958 --> 00:08:33.958\nwhich is why you can lose weight on any diet if you eat less food,\n\n00:08:33.958 --> 00:08:35.958\nor if you restrict entire categories of foods.\n\n00:08:35.958 --> 00:08:39.958\nBut the problem is, you get hungry, so it\u2019s hard to keep it off.\n\n00:08:39.958 --> 00:08:41.958\nThe other way is to change the type of food.\n\n00:08:41.958 --> 00:08:43.958\nAnd fat has nine calories per gram,\n\n00:08:43.958 --> 00:08:45.958\nwhereas protein and carbs only have four.\n\n00:08:45.958 --> 00:08:49.958\nSo, when you eat less fat, you eat fewer calories without having to eat less food.\n\n00:08:49.958 --> 00:08:52.958\nSo you can eat the same amount of food, but you\u2019ll be getting fewer calories\n\n00:08:52.958 --> 00:08:54.958\nbecause the food is less dense in calories.\n\n00:08:54.958 --> 00:08:58.958\nAnd it\u2019s the volume of food that affects satiety, rather than the type of food.\n\n00:08:58.958 --> 00:09:00.958\nYou know, I don\u2019t like talking about the Atkins diet, but I get asked about it every day,\n\n00:09:00.958 --> 00:09:02.958\nand so I just thought I\u2019d spend a few minutes on that.\n\n00:09:02.958 --> 00:09:04.958\nThe myth that you hear about is,\n\n00:09:04.958 --> 00:09:06.958\nAmericans have been told to eat less fat,\n\n00:09:06.958 --> 00:09:08.958\nthe percent of calories from fat is down,\n\n00:09:08.958 --> 00:09:11.958\nAmericans are fatter than ever, therefore fat doesn\u2019t make you fat.\n\n00:09:11.958 --> 00:09:15.958\nIt\u2019s a half-truth. Actually, Americans are eating more fat than ever,\n\n00:09:15.958 --> 00:09:17.958\nand even more carbs. And so the percentage is lower,\n\n00:09:17.958 --> 00:09:20.958\nthe actual amount is higher, and so the goal is to reduce both.\n\n00:09:20.958 --> 00:09:24.958\nDr. Atkins and I debated each other many times before he died,\n\n00:09:24.958 --> 00:09:26.958\nand we agreed that Americans eat too many simple carbs,\n\n00:09:26.958 --> 00:09:28.958\nthe \"bad carbs,\" and these are things like --\n\n00:09:28.958 --> 00:09:30.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:09:30.958 --> 00:09:33.958\n-- sugar, white flour, white rice, alcohol. And you get a double whammy:\n\n00:09:33.958 --> 00:09:36.958\nyou get all these calories that don\u2019t fill you up because you\u2019ve removed the fiber,\n\n00:09:36.958 --> 00:09:39.958\nand they get absorbed quickly so your blood sugar zooms up.\n\n00:09:39.958 --> 00:09:42.958\nYour pancreas makes insulin to bring it back down, which is good.\n\n00:09:42.958 --> 00:09:45.958\nBut insulin accelerates the conversion of calories into fat.\n\n00:09:45.958 --> 00:09:47.958\nSo, the goal is not to go to pork rinds and bacon and sausages --\n\n00:09:47.958 --> 00:09:49.958\nthese are not health foods --\n\n00:09:49.958 --> 00:09:51.958\nbut to go from \"bad carbs\" to what are called \"good carbs.\"\n\n00:09:51.958 --> 00:09:54.958\nAnd these are things like whole foods, or unrefined carbs:\n\n00:09:54.958 --> 00:09:59.958\nfruits, vegetables, whole wheat flour, brown rice, in their natural forms, are rich in fiber.\n\n00:09:59.958 --> 00:10:02.958\nAnd the fiber fills you up before you get too many calories,\n\n00:10:02.958 --> 00:10:06.958\nand it slows the absorption so you don\u2019t get that rapid rise in blood sugar.\n\n00:10:06.958 --> 00:10:09.958\nSo, and you get all the disease-protective substances.\n\n00:10:09.958 --> 00:10:11.958\nIt\u2019s not just what you exclude from your diet,\n\n00:10:11.958 --> 00:10:13.958\nbut also what you include that\u2019s protective.\n\n00:10:13.958 --> 00:10:16.958\nJust as all carbs are not bad for you, all fats are not bad for you. There are good fats.\n\n00:10:16.958 --> 00:10:19.958\nAnd these are predominantly what are called the Omega-3 fatty acids.\n\n00:10:19.958 --> 00:10:21.958\nYou find these, for example, in fish oil.\n\n00:10:21.958 --> 00:10:24.958\nAnd the bad fats are things like trans-fatty acids and processed food\n\n00:10:24.958 --> 00:10:26.958\nand saturated fats, which we find in meat.\n\n00:10:26.958 --> 00:10:28.958\nIf you don\u2019t remember anything else from this talk,\n\n00:10:28.958 --> 00:10:31.958\nthree grams a day of fish oil can reduce your risk of a heart attack\n\n00:10:31.958 --> 00:10:33.958\nand sudden death by 50 to 80 percent.\n\n00:10:33.958 --> 00:10:35.958\nThree grams a day. They come in one-gram capsules;\n\n00:10:35.958 --> 00:10:37.958\nmore than that just gives you extra fat you don\u2019t need.\n\n00:10:37.958 --> 00:10:40.958\nIt also helps reduce the risk of the most common cancers\n\n00:10:40.958 --> 00:10:42.958\nlike breast, prostate and colon cancer.\n\n00:10:42.958 --> 00:10:44.958\nNow, the problem with the Atkins diet,\n\n00:10:44.958 --> 00:10:46.958\neverybody knows people who have lost weight on it,\n\n00:10:46.958 --> 00:10:48.958\nbut you can lose weight on amphetamines, you know, and fen-phen.\n\n00:10:48.958 --> 00:10:51.958\nI mean, there are lots of ways of losing weight that aren\u2019t good for you.\n\n00:10:51.958 --> 00:10:53.958\nYou want to lose weight in a way that enhances your health\n\n00:10:53.958 --> 00:10:55.958\nrather than the one that harms it.\n\n00:10:55.958 --> 00:10:57.958\nAnd the problem is that it\u2019s based on this half-truth,\n\n00:10:57.958 --> 00:11:00.958\nwhich is that Americans eat too many simple carbs,\n\n00:11:00.958 --> 00:11:02.958\nso if you eat fewer simple carbs you\u2019re going to lose weight.\n\n00:11:02.958 --> 00:11:05.958\nYou\u2019ll lose even more weight if you go to whole foods and less fat,\n\n00:11:05.958 --> 00:11:07.958\nand you\u2019ll enhance your health rather than harming it.\n\n00:11:07.958 --> 00:11:09.958\nHe says, \"I\u2019ve got some good news.\n\n00:11:09.958 --> 00:11:11.958\nWhile your cholesterol level has remained the same,\n\n00:11:11.958 --> 00:11:13.958\nthe research findings have changed.\"\n\n00:11:13.958 --> 00:11:14.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:11:14.958 --> 00:11:17.958\nNow, what happens to your heart when you go on an Atkins diet?\n\n00:11:17.958 --> 00:11:19.958\nThe red is good at the beginning, and a year later --\n\n00:11:19.958 --> 00:11:23.958\nthis is from a study done in a peer-reviewed journal called Angiology --\n\n00:11:23.958 --> 00:11:26.958\nthere\u2019s more red after a year on a diet like I would recommend,\n\n00:11:26.958 --> 00:11:29.958\nthere\u2019s less red, less blood flow after a year on an Atkins-type diet.\n\n00:11:29.958 --> 00:11:33.958\nSo, yes, you can lose weight, but your heart isn\u2019t happy.\n\n00:11:33.958 --> 00:11:35.958\nNow, one of the studies funded by the Atkins Center\n\n00:11:35.958 --> 00:11:39.958\nfound that 70 percent of the people were constipated, 65 percent had bad breath,\n\n00:11:39.958 --> 00:11:43.958\n54 percent had headaches \u2013 this is not a healthy way to eat.\n\n00:11:43.958 --> 00:11:46.958\nAnd so, you might start to lose weight and start to attract people towards you,\n\n00:11:46.958 --> 00:11:48.958\nbut when they get too close it\u2019s going to be a problem.\n\n00:11:48.958 --> 00:11:50.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:11:50.958 --> 00:11:53.958\nAnd more seriously, there are case reports now of 16-year-old girls\n\n00:11:53.958 --> 00:11:55.958\nwho died after a few weeks on the Atkins diet --\n\n00:11:55.958 --> 00:11:57.958\nof bone disease, kidney disease, and so on.\n\n00:11:57.958 --> 00:11:59.958\nAnd that\u2019s how your body excretes waste, is through your breath,\n\n00:11:59.958 --> 00:12:01.958\nyour bowels and your perspiration.\n\n00:12:01.958 --> 00:12:04.958\nSo when you go on these kinds of diet, they begin to smell bad.\n\n00:12:04.958 --> 00:12:08.958\nSo, an optimal diet is low in fat, low in the bad carbs,\n\n00:12:08.958 --> 00:12:10.958\nhigh in the good carbs and enough of the good fats.\n\n00:12:10.958 --> 00:12:12.958\nAnd then, again, it\u2019s a spectrum:\n\n00:12:12.958 --> 00:12:14.958\nwhen you move in this direction, you\u2019re going to lose weight,\n\n00:12:14.958 --> 00:12:17.958\nyou\u2019re going to feel better and you\u2019re going to gain health.\n\n00:12:17.958 --> 00:12:20.958\nNow, there are ecological reasons for eating lower on the food chain too,\n\n00:12:20.958 --> 00:12:24.958\nwhether it\u2019s the deforestation of the Amazon, or making more protein available,\n\n00:12:24.958 --> 00:12:27.958\nto the four billion people who live on a dollar a day --\n\n00:12:27.958 --> 00:12:29.958\nnot to mention whatever ethical concerns people have.\n\n00:12:29.958 --> 00:12:33.958\nSo, there are lots of reasons for eating this way that go beyond just your health.\n\n00:12:33.958 --> 00:12:35.958\nNow, we\u2019re about to publish the first study\n\n00:12:35.958 --> 00:12:39.958\nlooking at the effects of this program on prostate cancer,\n\n00:12:39.958 --> 00:12:42.958\nand, in collaboration with Sloane-Kettering and with UCSF.\n\n00:12:42.958 --> 00:12:46.958\nWe took 90 men who had biopsy-proven prostate cancer\n\n00:12:46.958 --> 00:12:49.958\nand who had elected, for reasons unrelated to the study, not to have surgery.\n\n00:12:49.958 --> 00:12:51.958\nWe could randomly divide them into two groups,\n\n00:12:51.958 --> 00:12:53.958\nand then we could have one group\n\n00:12:53.958 --> 00:12:55.958\nthat is a non-intervention control group to compare to,\n\n00:12:55.958 --> 00:12:58.958\nwhich we can\u2019t do with, say, breast cancer, because everyone gets treated.\n\n00:12:58.958 --> 00:13:00.958\nWhat we found was that, after a year,\n\n00:13:00.958 --> 00:13:02.958\nnone of the experimental group patients\n\n00:13:02.958 --> 00:13:04.958\nwho made these lifestyle changes needed treatment,\n\n00:13:04.958 --> 00:13:07.958\nwhereas six of the control-group patients needed surgery or radiation.\n\n00:13:07.958 --> 00:13:11.958\nWhen we looked at their PSA levels -- which is a marker for prostate cancer --\n\n00:13:11.958 --> 00:13:13.958\nthey got worse in the control group,\n\n00:13:13.958 --> 00:13:15.958\nbut they actually got better in the experimental group,\n\n00:13:15.958 --> 00:13:17.958\nand these differences were highly significant.\n\n00:13:17.958 --> 00:13:19.958\nAnd then I wondered: was there any relationship\n\n00:13:19.958 --> 00:13:21.958\nbetween how much people changed their diet and lifestyle --\n\n00:13:21.958 --> 00:13:23.958\nwhichever group they were in -- and the changes in PSA?\n\n00:13:23.958 --> 00:13:26.958\nAnd sure enough, we found a dose-response relationship,\n\n00:13:26.958 --> 00:13:29.958\njust like we found in the arterial blockages in our cardiac studies.\n\n00:13:29.958 --> 00:13:32.958\nAnd in order for the PSA to go down, they had to make pretty big changes.\n\n00:13:32.958 --> 00:13:35.958\nI then wondered, well, maybe they\u2019re just changing their PSA,\n\n00:13:35.958 --> 00:13:37.958\nbut it\u2019s not really affecting the tumor growth.\n\n00:13:37.958 --> 00:13:40.958\nSo we took some of their blood serum and sent it down to UCLA;\n\n00:13:40.958 --> 00:13:44.958\nthey added it to a standard line of prostate tumor cells growing in tissue culture,\n\n00:13:44.958 --> 00:13:46.958\nand it inhibited the growth seven times more\n\n00:13:46.958 --> 00:13:51.958\nin the experimental group than in the control group -- 70 versus 9 percent.\n\n00:13:51.958 --> 00:13:53.958\nAnd finally, I said, I wonder if there\u2019s any relationship between\n\n00:13:53.958 --> 00:13:56.958\nhow much people change and how it inhibited their tumor growth,\n\n00:13:56.958 --> 00:13:57.958\nwhichever group they happened to be in.\n\n00:13:57.958 --> 00:13:59.958\nAnd this really got me excited because again,\n\n00:13:59.958 --> 00:14:02.958\nwe found the same pattern: the more people change,\n\n00:14:02.958 --> 00:14:05.958\nthe more it affected the growth of their tumors.\n\n00:14:05.958 --> 00:14:08.958\nAnd finally, we did MRI and MR spectroscopy scans on some of these patients,\n\n00:14:08.958 --> 00:14:10.958\nand the tumor activity is shown in red in this patient,\n\n00:14:10.958 --> 00:14:14.958\nand you can see clearly it\u2019s better a year later, along with the PSA going down.\n\n00:14:14.958 --> 00:14:18.958\nSo, if it\u2019s true for prostate cancer, it\u2019ll almost certainly be true for breast cancer as well.\n\n00:14:18.958 --> 00:14:20.958\nAnd whether or not you have conventional treatment,\n\n00:14:20.958 --> 00:14:24.958\nin addition, if you make these changes, it may help reduce the risk of recurrence.\n\n00:14:24.958 --> 00:14:28.958\nThe last thing I want to talk about, apropos of the issue of the pursuit of happiness,\n\n00:14:28.958 --> 00:14:30.958\nis that study after study have shown\n\n00:14:30.958 --> 00:14:32.958\nthat people who are lonely and depressed --\n\n00:14:32.958 --> 00:14:35.958\nand depression is the other real epidemic in our culture --\n\n00:14:35.958 --> 00:14:38.958\nare many times more likely to get sick and die prematurely,\n\n00:14:38.958 --> 00:14:41.958\nin part because, as we talked about, they\u2019re more likely to smoke\n\n00:14:41.958 --> 00:14:44.958\nand overeat and drink too much and work too hard and so on.\n\n00:14:44.958 --> 00:14:47.958\nBut also, through mechanisms that we don\u2019t fully understand,\n\n00:14:47.958 --> 00:14:49.958\npeople who are lonely and depressed are many times --\n\n00:14:49.958 --> 00:14:51.958\nthree to five to ten times, in some studies --\n\n00:14:51.958 --> 00:14:53.958\nmore likely to get sick and die prematurely.\n\n00:14:53.958 --> 00:14:56.958\nAnd depression is treatable. We need to do something about that.\n\n00:14:56.958 --> 00:14:59.958\nNow, on the other hand, anything that promotes intimacy is healing.\n\n00:14:59.958 --> 00:15:01.958\nIt can be sexual intimacy \u2013\n\n00:15:01.958 --> 00:15:03.958\nI happen to think that healing energy and erotic energy\n\n00:15:03.958 --> 00:15:05.958\nare just different forms of the same thing.\n\n00:15:05.958 --> 00:15:10.958\nFriendship, altruism, compassion, service \u2013 all the perennial truths that we talked about\n\n00:15:10.958 --> 00:15:12.958\nthat are part of all religion and all cultures --\n\n00:15:12.958 --> 00:15:15.958\nonce you stop trying to see the differences,\n\n00:15:15.958 --> 00:15:17.958\nthese are the things in our own self-interest,\n\n00:15:17.958 --> 00:15:21.958\nbecause they free us from our suffering and from disease.\n\n00:15:21.958 --> 00:15:25.958\nAnd it\u2019s in a sense the most selfish thing that we can do.\n\n00:15:25.958 --> 00:15:28.958\nJust take a look at one study. This was done by David Spiegel at Stanford.\n\n00:15:28.958 --> 00:15:30.958\nHe took women with metastatic breast cancer,\n\n00:15:30.958 --> 00:15:32.958\nrandomly divided them into two groups.\n\n00:15:32.958 --> 00:15:35.958\nOne group of people just met for an hour-and-a-half once a week in a support group.\n\n00:15:35.958 --> 00:15:37.958\nIt was a nurturing, loving environment,\n\n00:15:37.958 --> 00:15:39.958\nwhere they were encouraged to let down their emotional defenses\n\n00:15:39.958 --> 00:15:41.958\nand talk about how awful it is to have breast cancer\n\n00:15:41.958 --> 00:15:43.958\nwith people who understood, because they were going through it too.\n\n00:15:43.958 --> 00:15:45.958\nThey just met once a week for a year.\n\n00:15:45.958 --> 00:15:49.958\nFive years later, those women lived twice as long, and you can see that the people --\n\n00:15:49.958 --> 00:15:51.958\nand that was the only difference between the groups.\n\n00:15:51.958 --> 00:15:53.958\nIt was a randomized control study published in The Lancet.\n\n00:15:53.958 --> 00:15:56.958\nOther studies have shown this as well.\n\n00:15:56.958 --> 00:15:58.958\nSo, these simple things that create intimacy are really healing,\n\n00:15:58.958 --> 00:16:01.958\nand even the word healing, it comes from the root \"to make whole.\"\n\n00:16:01.958 --> 00:16:03.958\nThe word yoga comes from the Sanskrit,\n\n00:16:03.958 --> 00:16:06.958\nmeaning \"union, to yoke, to bring together.\"\n\n00:16:06.958 --> 00:16:09.958\nAnd the last slide I want to show you is from -- I was -- again,\n\n00:16:09.958 --> 00:16:11.958\nthis swami that I studied with for so many years, and I\n\n00:16:11.958 --> 00:16:14.958\ndid a combined oncology and cardiology Grand Rounds\n\n00:16:14.958 --> 00:16:16.958\nat the University of Virginia medical school a couple of years ago.\n\n00:16:16.958 --> 00:16:18.958\nAnd at the end of it, somebody said,\n\n00:16:18.958 --> 00:16:22.958\n\"Hey, Swami, what\u2019s the difference between wellness and illness?\"\n\n00:16:22.958 --> 00:16:24.958\nAnd so he went up on the board and he wrote the word \"illness,\"\n\n00:16:24.958 --> 00:16:27.958\nand circled the first letter, and then wrote the word \"wellness,\"\n\n00:16:27.958 --> 00:16:29.958\nand circled the first two letters ...\n\n00:16:29.958 --> 00:16:31.958\nTo me, it\u2019s just shorthand for what we\u2019re talking about:\n\n00:16:31.958 --> 00:16:33.958\nthat anything that creates a sense of connection\n\n00:16:33.958 --> 00:16:36.958\nand community and love is really healing.\n\n00:16:36.958 --> 00:16:41.958\nAnd then we can enjoy our lives more fully without getting sick in the process.\n\n00:16:41.958 --> 00:16:43.958\nThank you. (Applause)"}, {"title": "Aliens, love -- where are they?", "duration": "1000", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/john_hodgman_s_brief_digression", "transcript": "You all know this story. In the summer of 1950, Enrico Fermi, the Italian-American physicist and atomic-pile builder, went to lunch at Los Alamos National Laboratory and joined some colleagues there, and asked them a question: \"Where is everybody?\" This confused his colleagues, obviously, because they were sitting right there with him. And then he had to clarify that he wasn't talking about them. He was talking about the space aliens.You see, this was only a few years after the supposed flying saucer crash at Roswell, New Mexico. And even though that turned out to be nothing, nothing at all \u2014 (Laughter) \u2014 merely a downed weather balloon piloted by small hairless men with slits for mouths ... Still, America had gone saucer-mad, even famous scientists who were eating lunch. Fermi's reasoning, if I may paraphrase badly, is that the universe is so vast that it stands to reason, there should be other intelligent life out there. And the universe is so old that unless we were the very first civilization ever to evolve, we should have some evidence of their existence by now. And yet, to the best of our knowledge, we are alone.\"Where is everybody?\" asked Fermi, and his colleagues had no answer. Fermi then went on with the same blunt logic to disprove fairies, Sasquatch, God, the possibility of love \u2014 and thereafter, as you know, Enrico Fermi ate alone. (Laughter) Now, I am not a scientist. I have never built an atomic pile. Although, I might argue that, technically, every pile is atomic.(Laughter)However, with respect, I might point out two possibilities that Enrico Fermi perhaps did not consider. One is that the aliens might be very far away. Perhaps, I dare say, even on other planets. The other possibility \u2014 (Laughter) \u2014 is, perhaps, Enrico Fermi himself was an alien.(Laughter)Think about it. Isn't it a little convenient that in the midst of the World War, out of nowhere, suddenly an Italian scientist showed up with an amazing new technology that would transform everything in the world and darken the history of the human species forever after? And isn't it a little strange that he required no payment for this? That he asked for only one thing \u2014 a gift of two healthy sperm whales? That's \u2014 that's not true. But it is strange.(Laughter)And if Enrico Fermi were indeed a space alien, wouldn't he be the first to have tried to convince his fellow scientists that the space aliens are not already here? For it is given in certain UFO-ology or UFOlogy circles, that the aliens are already here and have been for millennia; that they have walked among us in disguise, observing us, guiding our evolution from ape to man \u2014 if you believe in that sort of thing \u2014 and, occasionally, kidnapping us in their flying saucers and taking us away to have sex with us in pyramids.(Laughter)It's a difficult theory to discount, I think you'll agree.(Laughter)For even in my own life, there are memories I have that are difficult to explain \u2014 happenings that are so odd and unaccountably weird, that it is difficult to imagine they were not the result of prolonged and frequent contact with aliens throughout my life. For how else will you explain the amazing and absolutely true close encounters that I had and will describe to you now? Encounter one: Ocean City, New Jersey, 1980. This was the summer when the special edition of \"Close Encounters of the Third Kind\" was released. And I went on vacation with my parents to the Jersey shore. Within 12 hours, I was horribly sunburned, just like Richard Dreyfuss in the movie.(Laughter)And so I spent the rest of the vacation largely sitting outside our little rental house at night, the sidewalk still warm from the sun, watching the skies for UFOs. What did I see? Stars, satellites, blinking airplanes \u2014 typical sky junk. Occasionally, kids would come and join me and watch, but their necks soon got sore, and they would go off to the boardwalk to play video games and mingle with humans. I was pretty good at the video games. I was not very good at the other part, so I stayed alone with the cosmos.And that's when it happened. An elderly couple came walking down the street. I would say they were in their late seventies, and I would say that they were on a date, because he was wearing a very neat little suit with a yellow tie \u2014 a brown suit. And she was wearing a cardigan, because it was now fully night and a chill was coming in off the ocean. I remember, for some reason, that they were exactly the same height. And then they stopped, and the man turned to me and said, \"What are you looking for, flying saucers?\"(Laughter)You have to admit, that's a pretty boss piece of detective work for an old man on a date. But what was stranger still \u2014 and even I realized it at the time, as a nine-year-old child \u2014 was that they stopped at all. That this old man would interrupt his moonlight stroll with his sweetheart with the precise reason of making fun of a child. \"Oh,\" he said, \"little green men.\" And then his girlfriend joined in, too. \"There's no such thing as space men,\" she said. \"There's no such thing.\" And then they both laughed. \"Ha, ha, ha.\" I looked around. The street was entirely empty. I had stopped hearing the sound of the ocean. It was as though time had stopped. I did not know why they were teasing me. I looked into their strangely angry faces, and I remember wondering, are they wearing rubber masks?(Laughter)And what would be behind those rubber masks, if they were? Giant, almond-shaped, unblinking eyes? Slits for mouths? The old man crooked his finger as though he were firing a gun, and then he made laser sounds. \"Kew, kew, kew \u2014 watch out.\" And they turned at once and walked away. The old man reached out his knobbly claw for the woman's hand, and found it, and left me alone. Now, you could describe this as a simple misunderstanding \u2014 a strange encounter among humans. Maybe it was swamp gas, but \u2014 (Laughter) \u2014 I know what I saw.Close encounter two: Brookline, Massachusetts, 1984. I went to see the movie \"Dune,\" and a girl talked to me. Now, on its face \u2014 (Laughter) \u2014 this is impossible on its face, I realize \u2014 but it is absolutely true. It was opening night, naturally. I went with my friend Tim McGonigal, who sat on my left. On my right was the girl in question. She had long, curly black hair, a blue jean jacket. I remember, she had some sort of injury to her ankle, an Ace bandage, and she had crutches. She was very tall, I would say. I was starting high school at the time. I would say she was a junior, but I had never seen her before. She didn't go to my school. I didn't know her name, and I never will. She was sitting with someone who I presume was her mother, and they were talking about the novel, \"Dune.\" They were both big fans, mother and daughter \u2014 very unusual. They were talking about how their favorite characters were the giant sandworms. And then it got stranger. That's when she turned to me and said, \"Are you looking forward to seeing the movie?\"(Laughter)First of all, I was embarrassed because I had not read the novel \"Dune\" at that time. I was merely a connoisseur of movies featuring desert planets, as I still am.(Laughter) But it was also the tone of how she asked the question: apropos of nothing, like she didn't even care about the answer, as though she just wanted to talk to me. I did not know what to say. I said, \"Yes.\" I did not even turn my head. The movie began. I need not remind you that this was David Lynch's version of \"Dune,\" in which all of the characters were sexy and deformed at the same time.(Laughter)There was a character called the Third-Stage Guild Navigator, which was a kind of giant, floating fetus-creature that lived in a giant tank with this orange mist of psychedelic spice swirling around him, allowing him to bend space and time. He could never leave the tank or interact with the outside world. He had become, in his isolation, so deformed and so sexy, that he had to talk through a kind of old-timey radio to the outside world, and could never touch them. I mean, I liked him a lot better than the sandworms. The sandworms were fine, but your favorite character? Please.When the movie ended, everyone seemed very happy to get up and get out of the theatre as soon as possible. Except for the girl. As I walked out, her pace slowed. Perhaps it was the crutches, but it seemed \u2014 (Laughter) \u2014 it seemed as though she might want to talk to me again. When I say it out loud, it sounds so ridiculous, but I can only come to the conclusion that it was what, in the alien abductee community, they call a \"screen memory\": a ridiculous false recollection designed by their brain to cover up some trauma \u2014 say, of being kidnapped and flown off to a sex pyramid.(Laughter)And so I sure am glad I did not slow down to talk to her. I sure am glad I never saw her again.Close encounter three: Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, 1989. In the mid-to-late '80s, the novelist Whitley Strieber wrote a book called \"Communion,\" in which he described his own lifelong experiences being abducted by aliens. And he also described the phenomenon known in this community as \"lost time,\" where Whitley Strieber would suddenly become aware that he could not remember the previous ten minutes, or the previous ten hours, or the previous ten days. And would come to the conclusion that that was when the aliens were taking him and giving him rectal probes.(Laughter)This book became, naturally, an enormous best-seller. This image by Ted Joseph was from that book, and was his, sort of, police sketch of what the creatures looked like that Whitley Strieber had described to him. And it was so successful that they made it into a movie. And in 1989, the way I remember it, I was in Philadelphia visiting my girlfriend, and we decided, apropos of nothing, to go see this movie. And the way I remember it, the movie featured these details. One: Whitley Strieber was played by Christopher Walken. Two: the alien was played by a rubber puppet.(Laughter)Three: there was a surprisingly long sequence of the film in which the rubber puppet gives Christopher Walken a rectal probe. Four: this was being shown in a regular movie theater in Center City, Philadelphia. Five: all of which is to say, they made a movie out of the book, \"Communion,\" and it starred Christopher Walken. Does something seem strange about this to you? Something odd? Something off? Something wrong with this picture? Think about it. Yes. The answer is: I had a girlfriend. What?(Laughter)How did this happen? When did this happen? I remember walking out of the theater and becoming suddenly aware of this fact, as we walked hand in hand, and pondering these very same questions. And to this day, I have no answer for you. Close encounter four: the Algarve, Portugal, 1991. Some years later, I and this woman \u2014 we'll call her \"Catherine Fletcher\" \u2014 (Laughter) \u2014 went traveling through the south of Portugal together. We stayed in old, crumbling, walled cities, in tiny little hotels, and we would climb up to the roof and drink Vinho Verde and watch the sun set and play checkers. What? Did we do this? Really? Does anyone do this? We went to some topless beaches. Excuse me? No, not in my life. For what it's worth, we went to Sagres, which was considered, at the time, to be the end of the world. And there I was chased by a pack of feral dogs on the dock, and the lead dog bit me on the ass, requiring me to go to a strange Portuguese clinic and receive an ass shot. Make of that what you will.(Laughter)Our last day in Portugal, we were in the district capital of Faro, and Catherine decided that she wanted to go to the beach one last time. Now, Faro is a bustling little city, and to get to the beach, she explained, you would have to take a bus and then a boat. And did I want to come with? But I was exhausted and dog-bitten, and so I said, \"No.\" I remember what she looked like before she left. The freckles had grown and multiplied on her face and shoulders, clustering into a kind of a tan. A tan, we were both tan \u2014 is this true? Her eyes were extra bright and extra blue, as a result. She was smiling. She was a single woman about to go alone into a country, not even speaking the language, to travel alone by bus and boat to go to a beach she did not know or had never seen. I loved her, and then she went out into that strange, alien land.It took me some time to come to my senses. I had my own \"lost time\" moment, where I woke up and suddenly realized it was very late in the day, almost dinnertime, and she had not come back. Nervous, I went down to the street to look for her. Now, I did not speak Portuguese. I did not know where the beach was. I could not call her on a cell phone because this was 1991, and the aliens had not given us that technology yet.(Laughter)I realized that the day would only have two possible outcomes: either Catherine would come back to the hotel, or she would never come back to the hotel. And so I sat down to wait. I did not watch the skies, but the very end of the street where the buses and cars and pedestrians and little scooters were moving along. And I watched those constellations shift, hoping that they would part and I would see her face. It was at that moment, in that very small town of 30,000 or so, that I truly appreciated the vastness of the universe and the searching we might do in it. And that's when the Liberians came along. Five young men \u2014 all laughing, happy, traveling together, coming back to this hotel where they were staying.One of them was named Joseph, and he asked me what was I doing, and I explained. And he said, \"Don't worry.\" He was sure that Catherine would be safe. But he did not seem so very sure, for he sat down to wait with me. And for the next two hours, they all waited with me: taking turns, going up to their room, coming back, telling me jokes, distracting me. Two hours, they gave me a message. We are not alone.And then, in the middle of a sentence, at the very birth of twilight, I turned and looked down the street. The stars aligned, and she came back. She was smiling. She did not understand why I was so worried. Neither did the Liberians, although there was a huge amount of relief in their laughter as they clapped us on the back, and went back up to their room and left us alone in the street, holding hands. An event like this leaves a scar on the memory, much like a piece of alien technology that has been inserted into your buttocks by a \"Portuguese doctor.\"(Laughter)And even now, a decade and a half later, even now that we are married, I look for her still, whenever she is not in the room. And even though, I think you'll agree, it is probable that during the time she was away, she was kidnapped and replaced by an alien clone, I love her and wait for her still.Thank you for your kind attention.(Applause)", "id": 374, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:11.958 --> 00:00:13.958\nYou all know this story.\n\n00:00:13.958 --> 00:00:15.958\nIn the summer of 1950,\n\n00:00:15.958 --> 00:00:17.958\nEnrico Fermi, the Italian-American physicist\n\n00:00:17.958 --> 00:00:20.958\nand atomic-pile builder,\n\n00:00:20.958 --> 00:00:22.958\nwent to lunch at Los Alamos National Laboratory\n\n00:00:22.958 --> 00:00:25.958\nand joined some colleagues there, and asked them a question:\n\n00:00:25.958 --> 00:00:27.958\n\"Where is everybody?\"\n\n00:00:27.958 --> 00:00:30.958\nThis confused his colleagues, obviously,\n\n00:00:30.958 --> 00:00:32.958\nbecause they were sitting right there with him.\n\n00:00:32.958 --> 00:00:35.958\nAnd then he had to clarify that he wasn't talking about them.\n\n00:00:35.958 --> 00:00:38.958\nHe was talking about the space aliens.\n\n00:00:38.958 --> 00:00:40.958\nYou see, this was only a few years after\n\n00:00:40.958 --> 00:00:42.958\nthe supposed flying saucer crash\n\n00:00:42.958 --> 00:00:44.958\nat Roswell, New Mexico.\n\n00:00:44.958 --> 00:00:46.958\nAnd even though that turned out to be nothing,\n\n00:00:46.958 --> 00:00:48.958\nnothing at all --\n\n00:00:48.958 --> 00:00:51.958\n(Laughter) --\n\n00:00:51.958 --> 00:00:53.958\nmerely a downed weather balloon\n\n00:00:53.958 --> 00:00:56.958\npiloted by small hairless men\n\n00:00:56.958 --> 00:00:59.958\nwith slits for mouths ...\n\n00:00:59.958 --> 00:01:01.958\nStill, America had gone saucer-mad,\n\n00:01:01.958 --> 00:01:03.958\neven famous scientists\n\n00:01:03.958 --> 00:01:05.958\nwho were eating lunch.\n\n00:01:05.958 --> 00:01:07.958\nFermi's reasoning, if I may paraphrase badly,\n\n00:01:07.958 --> 00:01:09.958\nis that the universe is so vast\n\n00:01:09.958 --> 00:01:11.958\nthat it stands to reason,\n\n00:01:11.958 --> 00:01:14.958\nthere should be other intelligent life out there.\n\n00:01:14.958 --> 00:01:16.958\nAnd the universe is so old\n\n00:01:16.958 --> 00:01:19.958\nthat unless we were the very first civilization ever to evolve,\n\n00:01:19.958 --> 00:01:22.958\nwe should have some evidence of their existence by now.\n\n00:01:22.958 --> 00:01:25.958\nAnd yet, to the best of our knowledge, we are alone.\n\n00:01:25.958 --> 00:01:28.958\n\"Where is everybody?\" asked Fermi,\n\n00:01:28.958 --> 00:01:31.958\nand his colleagues had no answer.\n\n00:01:31.958 --> 00:01:33.958\nFermi then went on with the same blunt logic\n\n00:01:33.958 --> 00:01:35.958\nto disprove fairies,\n\n00:01:35.958 --> 00:01:37.958\nSasquatch, God,\n\n00:01:37.958 --> 00:01:40.958\nthe possibility of love --\n\n00:01:40.958 --> 00:01:42.958\nand thereafter, as you know,\n\n00:01:42.958 --> 00:01:44.958\nEnrico Fermi ate alone.\n\n00:01:44.958 --> 00:01:47.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:01:47.958 --> 00:01:48.958\nNow,\n\n00:01:48.958 --> 00:01:51.958\nI am not a scientist.\n\n00:01:51.958 --> 00:01:54.958\nI have never built an atomic pile.\n\n00:01:54.958 --> 00:01:56.958\nAlthough, I might argue that, technically,\n\n00:01:56.958 --> 00:01:58.958\nevery pile is atomic.\n\n00:01:58.958 --> 00:02:01.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:02:01.958 --> 00:02:04.958\nHowever, with respect, I might point out two possibilities\n\n00:02:04.958 --> 00:02:07.958\nthat Enrico Fermi perhaps did not consider.\n\n00:02:07.958 --> 00:02:09.958\nOne is that the aliens might be\n\n00:02:09.958 --> 00:02:11.958\nvery far away.\n\n00:02:11.958 --> 00:02:13.958\nPerhaps, I dare say,\n\n00:02:13.958 --> 00:02:15.958\neven on other planets.\n\n00:02:16.958 --> 00:02:18.958\nThe other possibility --\n\n00:02:18.958 --> 00:02:20.958\n(Laughter) --\n\n00:02:20.958 --> 00:02:22.958\nis, perhaps, Enrico Fermi himself\n\n00:02:22.958 --> 00:02:24.958\nwas an alien.\n\n00:02:24.958 --> 00:02:27.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:02:27.958 --> 00:02:29.958\nThink about it.\n\n00:02:29.958 --> 00:02:31.958\nIsn't it a little convenient\n\n00:02:31.958 --> 00:02:34.958\nthat in the midst of the World War, out of nowhere,\n\n00:02:34.958 --> 00:02:36.958\nsuddenly an Italian scientist showed up\n\n00:02:36.958 --> 00:02:38.958\nwith an amazing new technology\n\n00:02:38.958 --> 00:02:40.958\nthat would transform everything in the world\n\n00:02:40.958 --> 00:02:44.958\nand darken the history of the human species forever after?\n\n00:02:44.958 --> 00:02:46.958\nAnd isn't it a little strange\n\n00:02:46.958 --> 00:02:49.958\nthat he required no payment for this?\n\n00:02:49.958 --> 00:02:51.958\nThat he asked for only one thing --\n\n00:02:51.958 --> 00:02:54.958\na gift of two healthy sperm whales?\n\n00:02:54.958 --> 00:02:56.958\nThat's -- that's not true.\n\n00:02:56.958 --> 00:02:58.958\nBut it is strange.\n\n00:02:58.958 --> 00:03:02.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:03:02.958 --> 00:03:05.958\nAnd if Enrico Fermi were indeed a space alien,\n\n00:03:05.958 --> 00:03:07.958\nwouldn't he be the first to have tried to convince\n\n00:03:07.958 --> 00:03:09.958\nhis fellow scientists\n\n00:03:09.958 --> 00:03:13.958\nthat the space aliens are not already here?\n\n00:03:13.958 --> 00:03:15.958\nFor it is given in certain UFO-ology\n\n00:03:15.958 --> 00:03:18.958\nor UFOlogy circles,\n\n00:03:18.958 --> 00:03:21.958\nthat the aliens are already here and have been for millennia;\n\n00:03:21.958 --> 00:03:23.958\nthat they have walked among us in disguise,\n\n00:03:23.958 --> 00:03:25.958\nobserving us, guiding our evolution\n\n00:03:25.958 --> 00:03:27.958\nfrom ape to man --\n\n00:03:27.958 --> 00:03:30.958\nif you believe in that sort of thing --\n\n00:03:30.958 --> 00:03:33.958\nand, occasionally, kidnapping us in their flying saucers\n\n00:03:33.958 --> 00:03:36.958\nand taking us away to have sex with us in pyramids.\n\n00:03:36.958 --> 00:03:38.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:03:38.958 --> 00:03:40.958\nIt's a difficult theory to discount,\n\n00:03:40.958 --> 00:03:42.958\nI think you'll agree.\n\n00:03:42.958 --> 00:03:44.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:03:44.958 --> 00:03:46.958\nFor even in my own life,\n\n00:03:46.958 --> 00:03:48.958\nthere are memories I have\n\n00:03:48.958 --> 00:03:50.958\nthat are difficult to explain --\n\n00:03:50.958 --> 00:03:52.958\nhappenings that are so odd and unaccountably weird,\n\n00:03:52.958 --> 00:03:54.958\nthat it is difficult to imagine\n\n00:03:54.958 --> 00:03:56.958\nthey were not the result\n\n00:03:56.958 --> 00:03:59.958\nof prolonged and frequent contact with aliens throughout my life.\n\n00:03:59.958 --> 00:04:01.958\nFor how else will you explain\n\n00:04:01.958 --> 00:04:03.958\nthe amazing and absolutely true\n\n00:04:03.958 --> 00:04:05.958\nclose encounters that I had\n\n00:04:05.958 --> 00:04:08.958\nand will describe to you now?\n\n00:04:08.958 --> 00:04:10.958\nEncounter one: Ocean City, New Jersey, 1980.\n\n00:04:10.958 --> 00:04:13.958\nThis was the summer when the special edition of\n\n00:04:13.958 --> 00:04:15.958\n\"Close Encounters of the Third Kind\" was released.\n\n00:04:15.958 --> 00:04:18.958\nAnd I went on vacation with my parents to the Jersey shore.\n\n00:04:18.958 --> 00:04:21.958\nWithin 12 hours, I was horribly sunburned,\n\n00:04:21.958 --> 00:04:23.958\njust like Richard Dreyfuss in the movie.\n\n00:04:23.958 --> 00:04:24.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:04:24.958 --> 00:04:27.958\nAnd so I spent the rest of the vacation\n\n00:04:27.958 --> 00:04:30.958\nlargely sitting outside our little rental house at night,\n\n00:04:30.958 --> 00:04:32.958\nthe sidewalk still warm from the sun,\n\n00:04:32.958 --> 00:04:35.958\nwatching the skies for UFOs.\n\n00:04:35.958 --> 00:04:37.958\nWhat did I see?

days.\n\n00:10:38.958 --> 00:10:40.958\nAnd would come to the conclusion that that was when the aliens\n\n00:10:40.958 --> 00:10:43.958\nwere taking him and giving him rectal probes.\n\n00:10:43.958 --> 00:10:45.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:10:45.958 --> 00:10:48.958\nThis book became, naturally, an enormous best-seller.\n\n00:10:48.958 --> 00:10:50.958\nThis image by Ted Joseph was from that

Did we do this? Really? Does anyone do this?\n\n00:12:40.958 --> 00:12:42.958\nWe went to some topless beaches.\n\n00:12:42.958 --> 00:12:45.958\nExcuse me? No, not in my life.\n\n00:12:45.958 --> 00:12:47.958\nFor what it's worth, we went to Sagres,\n\n00:12:47.958 --> 00:12:50.958\nwhich was considered, at the time, to be the end of the world.\n\n00:12:50.958 --> 00:12:53.958\nAnd there I was chased by a pack of feral dogs on the dock,\n\n00:12:53.958 --> 00:12:56.958\nand the lead dog bit me on the ass,\n\n00:12:56.958 --> 00:12:58.958\nrequiring me to go to a strange Portuguese clinic\n\n00:12:58.958 --> 00:13:00.958\nand receive an ass shot.\n\n00:13:00.958 --> 00:13:02.958\nMake of that what you will.\n\n00:13:02.958 --> 00:13:03.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:13:03.958 --> 00:13:05.958\nOur last day in Portugal,\n\n00:13:05.958 --> 00:13:08.958\nwe were in the district capital of Faro,\n\n00:13:08.958 --> 00:13:10.958\nand Catherine decided that she wanted to go to the beach\n\n00:13:10.958 --> 00:13:12.958\none last time.\n\n00:13:12.958 --> 00:13:14.958\nNow, Faro is a bustling little city,\n\n00:13:14.958 --> 00:13:16.958\nand to get to the beach, she explained, you would have to take\n\n00:13:16.958 --> 00:13:18.958\na bus and then a boat.\n\n00:13:18.958 --> 00:13:20.958\nAnd did I want to come with?\n\n00:13:20.958 --> 00:13:23.958\nBut I was exhausted and dog-bitten, and so I said, \"No.\"\n\n00:13:23.958 --> 00:13:26.958\nI remember what she looked like before she left.\n\n00:13:27.958 --> 00:13:29.958\nThe freckles had grown\n\n00:13:29.958 --> 00:13:32.958\nand multiplied on her face and shoulders,\n\n00:13:32.958 --> 00:13:34.958\nclustering into a kind of a tan.\n\n00:13:34.958 --> 00:13:36.958\nA tan, we were both tan --\n\n00:13:36.958 --> 00:13:38.958\nis this true?\n\n00:13:39.958 --> 00:13:42.958\nHer eyes were extra bright and extra blue, as a result.\n\n00:13:42.958 --> 00:13:44.958\nShe was smiling.\n\n00:13:44.958 --> 00:13:46.958\nShe was a single woman about to go alone into a country,\n\n00:13:46.958 --> 00:13:49.958\nnot even speaking the language,\n\n00:13:49.958 --> 00:13:51.958\nto travel alone by bus and boat\n\n00:13:51.958 --> 00:13:53.958\nto go to a beach she did not know\n\n00:13:53.958 --> 00:13:55.958\nor had never seen.\n\n00:13:55.958 --> 00:13:58.958\nI loved her, and then she went out\n\n00:13:58.958 --> 00:14:01.958\ninto that strange, alien land.\n\n00:14:01.958 --> 00:14:04.958\nIt took me some time to come to my senses.\n\n00:14:04.958 --> 00:14:05.958\nI had my own \"lost time\" moment,\n\n00:14:05.958 --> 00:14:08.958\nwhere I woke up and suddenly realized\n\n00:14:08.958 --> 00:14:10.958\nit was very late in the day, almost dinnertime,\n\n00:14:10.958 --> 00:14:12.958\nand she had not come back.\n\n00:14:12.958 --> 00:14:14.958\nNervous, I went down to the street to look for her.\n\n00:14:14.958 --> 00:14:17.958\nNow, I did not speak Portuguese.\n\n00:14:17.958 --> 00:14:19.958\nI did not know where the beach was.\n\n00:14:19.958 --> 00:14:22.958\nI could not call her on a cell phone because this was 1991,\n\n00:14:22.958 --> 00:14:24.958\nand the aliens had not given us that technology yet.\n\n00:14:24.958 --> 00:14:27.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:14:27.958 --> 00:14:29.958\nI realized that the day would only have\n\n00:14:29.958 --> 00:14:31.958\ntwo possible outcomes:\n\n00:14:31.958 --> 00:14:33.958\neither Catherine would come back to the hotel,\n\n00:14:33.958 --> 00:14:36.958\nor she would never come back to the hotel.\n\n00:14:36.958 --> 00:14:38.958\nAnd so I sat down to wait.\n\n00:14:38.958 --> 00:14:42.958\nI did not watch the skies, but the very end of the street\n\n00:14:42.958 --> 00:14:45.958\nwhere the buses and cars and pedestrians\n\n00:14:45.958 --> 00:14:47.958\nand little scooters were moving along.\n\n00:14:47.958 --> 00:14:49.958\nAnd I watched those constellations shift,\n\n00:14:49.958 --> 00:14:52.958\nhoping that they would part and I would see her face.\n\n00:14:52.958 --> 00:14:54.958\nIt was at that moment,\n\n00:14:54.958 --> 00:14:57.958\nin that very small town of 30,000 or so,\n\n00:14:57.958 --> 00:15:00.958\nthat I truly appreciated the vastness of the universe\n\n00:15:00.958 --> 00:15:03.958\nand the searching we might do in it.\n\n00:15:03.958 --> 00:15:05.958\nAnd that's when the Liberians came along.\n\n00:15:05.958 --> 00:15:08.958\nFive young men -- all laughing, happy, traveling together,\n\n00:15:08.958 --> 00:15:11.958\ncoming back to this hotel where they were staying.\n\n00:15:11.958 --> 00:15:13.958\nOne of them was named Joseph, and he asked me\n\n00:15:13.958 --> 00:15:15.958\nwhat was I doing, and I explained.\n\n00:15:15.958 --> 00:15:18.958\nAnd he said, \"Don't worry.\" He was sure that Catherine would be safe.\n\n00:15:18.958 --> 00:15:20.958\nBut he did not seem so very sure,\n\n00:15:20.958 --> 00:15:22.958\nfor he sat down to wait with me.\n\n00:15:22.958 --> 00:15:24.958\nAnd for the next two hours, they all waited with me:\n\n00:15:24.958 --> 00:15:27.958\ntaking turns, going up to their room, coming back,\n\n00:15:27.958 --> 00:15:28.958\ntelling me jokes, distracting me.\n\n00:15:28.958 --> 00:15:31.958\nTwo hours, they gave me a message.\n\n00:15:31.958 --> 00:15:33.958\nWe are not alone.\n\n00:15:33.958 --> 00:15:36.958\nAnd then, in the middle of a sentence, at the very birth of twilight,\n\n00:15:36.958 --> 00:15:38.958\nI turned and looked down the street.\n\n00:15:38.958 --> 00:15:41.958\nThe stars aligned, and she came back.\n\n00:15:41.958 --> 00:15:44.958\nShe was smiling. She did not understand why I was so worried.\n\n00:15:44.958 --> 00:15:46.958\nNeither did the Liberians,\n\n00:15:46.958 --> 00:15:48.958\nalthough there was a huge amount of relief in their laughter\n\n00:15:48.958 --> 00:15:51.958\nas they clapped us on the back, and went back up to their room\n\n00:15:51.958 --> 00:15:54.958\nand left us alone in the street, holding hands.\n\n00:15:54.958 --> 00:15:57.958\nAn event like this leaves a scar on the memory,\n\n00:15:57.958 --> 00:15:59.958\nmuch like a piece of alien technology\n\n00:15:59.958 --> 00:16:01.958\nthat has been inserted into your buttocks\n\n00:16:01.958 --> 00:16:03.958\nby a \"Portuguese doctor.\"\n\n00:16:03.958 --> 00:16:05.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:16:05.958 --> 00:16:07.958\nAnd even now, a decade and a half later,\n\n00:16:07.958 --> 00:16:09.958\neven now that we are married,\n\n00:16:09.958 --> 00:16:12.958\nI look for her still, whenever she is not in the room.\n\n00:16:12.958 --> 00:16:15.958\nAnd even though, I think you'll agree, it is probable\n\n00:16:15.958 --> 00:16:17.958\nthat during the time she was away,\n\n00:16:17.958 --> 00:16:19.958\nshe was kidnapped and replaced by an alien clone,\n\n00:16:20.958 --> 00:16:22.958\nI love her and wait for her still.\n\n00:16:22.958 --> 00:16:24.958\nThank you for your kind attention.\n\n00:16:24.958 --> 00:16:27.958\n(Applause)"}, {"title": "Nature vs. humans", "duration": "1368", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/paul_maccready_on_nature_vs_humans", "transcript": "You hear that this is the era of environment \u2014 or biology, or information technology ... Well, it's the era of a lot of different things that we're in right now. But one thing for sure: it's the era of change. There's more change going on than ever has occurred in the history of human life on earth. And you all sort of know it, but it's hard to get it so that you really understand it. And I've tried to put together something that's a good start for this. I've tried to show in this \u2014 though the color doesn't come out \u2014 that what I'm concerned with is the little 50-year time bubble that you are in. You tend to be interested in a generation past, a generation future \u2014 your parents, your kids, things you can change over the next few decades \u2014 and this 50-year time bubble you kind of move along in. And in that 50 years, if you look at the population curve, you find the population of humans on the earth more than doubles and we're up three-and-a-half times since I was born. When you have a new baby, by the time that kid gets out of high school more people will be added than existed on earth when I was born. This is unprecedented, and it's big. Where it goes in the future is questioned. So that's the human part.Now, the human part related to animals: look at the left side of that. What I call the human portion \u2014 humans and their livestock and pets \u2014 versus the natural portion \u2014 all the other wild animals and just \u2014 these are vertebrates and all the birds, etc., in the land and air, not in the water. How does it balance? Certainly, 10,000 years ago, the civilization's beginning, the human portion was less than one tenth of one percent. Let's look at it now. You follow this curve and you see the whiter spot in the middle \u2014 that's your 50-year time bubble. Humans, livestock and pets are now 97 percent of that integrated total mass on earth and all wild nature is three percent. We have won. The next generation doesn't even have to worry about this game \u2014 it is over. And the biggest problem came in the last 25 years: it went from 25 percent up to that 97 percent. And this really is a sobering picture upon realizing that we, humans, are in charge of life on earth; we're like the capricious Gods of old Greek myths, kind of playing with life \u2014 and not a great deal of wisdom injected into it.Now, the third curve is information technology. This is Moore's Law plotted here, which relates to density of information, but it has been pretty good for showing a lot of other things about information technology \u2014 computers, their use, Internet, etc. And what's important is it just goes straight up through the top of the curve, and has no real limits to it. Now try and contrast these. This is the size of the earth going through that same \u2014 (Laughter) \u2014 frame. And to make it really clear, I've put all four on one graph. There's no need to see the little detailed words on it. That first one is humans-versus-nature; we've won, there's no more gain. Human population. And so if you're looking for growth industries to get into, that's not a good one \u2014 protecting natural creatures. Human population is going up; it's going to continue for quite a while. Good business in obstetricians, morticians, and farming, housing, etc. \u2014 they all deal with human bodies, which require being fed, transported, housed and so on. And the information technology, which connects to our brains, has no limit \u2014 now, that is a wonderful field to be in. You're looking for growth opportunity? It's just going up through the roof. And then, the size of the Earth. Somehow making these all compatible with the Earth looks like a pretty bad industry to be involved with.So, that's the stage out of all this. I find, for reasons I don't understand, I really do have a goal. And the goal is that the world be desirable and sustainable when my kids reach my age \u2014 and I think that's \u2014 in other words, the next generation. I think that's a goal that we probably all share. I think it's a hopeless goal. Technologically, it's achievable; economically, it's achievable; politically, it means sort of the habits, institutions of people \u2014 it's impossible. The institutions of the past with all their inertia are just irrelevant for the future, except they're there and we have to deal with them. I spend about 15 percent of my time trying to save the world, the other 85 percent, the usual \u2014 and whatever else we devote ourselves to. And in that 15 percent, the main focus is on human mind, thinking skills, somehow trying to unleash kids from the straightjacket of school, which is putting information and dogma into them, get them so they really think, ask tough questions, argue about serious subjects, don't believe everything that's in the book, think broadly or creative. They can be. Our school systems are very flawed and do not reward you for the things that are important in life or for the survival of civilization; they reward you for a lot of learning and sopping up stuff. We can't go into that today because there isn't time \u2014 it's a broad subject. One thing for sure, in the future there is an essential feature \u2014 necessary, but not sufficient \u2014 which is doing more with less. We've got to be doing things with more efficiency using less energy, less material. Your great-great grandparents got by on muscle power, and yet we all think there's this huge power that's essential for our lifestyle. And with all the wonderful technology we have we can do things that are much more efficient: conserve, recycle, etc.Let me just rush very quickly through things that we've done. Human-powered airplane \u2014 Gossamer Condor sort of started me in this direction in 1976 and 77, winning the Kremer prize in aviation history, followed by the Albatross. And we began making various odd planes and creatures. Here's a giant flying replica of a pterosaur that has no tail. Trying to have it fly straight is like trying to shoot an arrow with the feathered end forward. It was a tough job, and boy it made me have a lot of respect for nature. This was the full size of the original creature. We did things on land, in the air, on water \u2014 vehicles of all different kinds, usually with some electronics or electric power systems in them. I find they're all the same, whether its land, air or water. I'll be focusing on the air here. This is a solar-powered airplane \u2014 165 miles carrying a person from France to England as a symbol that solar power is going to be an important part of our future. Then we did the solar car for General Motors \u2014 the Sunracer \u2014 that won the race in Australia. We got a lot of people thinking about electric cars, what you could do with them. A few years later, when we suggested to GM that now is the time and we could do a thing called the Impact, they sponsored it, and here's the Impact that we developed with them on their programs. This is the demonstrator. And they put huge effort into turning it into a commercial product.With that preamble, let's show the first two-minute videotape, which shows a little airplane for surveillance and moving to a giant airplane. Narrator: A tiny airplane, the AV Pointer serves for surveillance \u2014 in effect, a pair of roving eyeglasses. A cutting-edge example of where miniaturization can lead if the operator is remote from the vehicle. It is convenient to carry, assemble and launch by hand. Battery-powered, it is silent and rarely noticed. It sends high-resolution video pictures back to the operator. With onboard GPS, it can navigate autonomously, and it is rugged enough to self-land without damage. The modern sailplane is superbly efficient. Some can glide as flat as 60 feet forward for every foot of descent. They are powered only by the energy they can extract from the atmosphere \u2014 an atmosphere nature stirs up by solar energy. Humans and soaring birds have found nature to be generous in providing replenishable energy. Sailplanes have flown over 1,000 miles, and the altitude record is over 50,000 feet. (Music) The Solar Challenger was made to serve as a symbol that photovoltaic cells can produce real power and will be part of the world's energy future. In 1981, it flew 163 miles from Paris to England, solely on the power of sunbeams, and established a basis for the Pathfinder. (Music) The message from all these vehicles is that ideas and technology can be harnessed to produce remarkable gains in doing more with less \u2014 gains that can help us attain a desirable balance between technology and nature. The stakes are high as we speed toward a challenging future. Buckminster Fuller said it clearly: \"there are no passengers on spaceship Earth, only crew. We, the crew, can and must do more with less \u2014 much less.\"Paul MacCready: If we could have the second video, the one-minute, put in as quickly as you can, which \u2014 this will show the Pathfinder airplane in some flights this past year in Hawaii, and will show a sequence of some of the beauty behind it after it had just flown to 71,530 feet \u2014 higher than any propeller airplane has ever flown. It's amazing: just on the puny power of the sun \u2014 by having a super lightweight plane, you're able to get it up there. It's part of a long-term program NASA sponsored. And we worked very closely with the whole thing being a team effort, and with wonderful results like that flight. And we're working on a bigger plane \u2014 220-foot span \u2014 and an intermediate-size, one with a regenerative fuel cell that can store excess energy during the day, feed it back at night, and stay up 65,000 feet for months at a time. (Music) Ray Morgan's voice will come in here. There he's the project manager. Anything they do is certainly a team effort. He ran this program. Here's ... some things he showed as a celebration at the very end. Ray Morgan: We'd just ended a seven-month deployment of Hawaii. For those who live on the mainland, it was tough being away from home. The friendly support, the quiet confidence, congenial hospitality shown by our Hawaiian and military hosts \u2014 (Music) this is starting \u2014 made the experience enjoyable and unforgettable. PM: We have real-time IR scans going out through the Internet while the plane is flying. And it's exploring without polluting the stratosphere. That's its goal: the stratosphere, the blanket that really controls the radiation of the earth and permits life on earth to be the success that it is \u2014 probing that is very important. And also we consider it as a sort of poor man's stationary satellite, because it can stay right overhead for months at a time, 2,000 times closer than the real GFC synchronous satellite. We couldn't bring one here to fly it and show you.But now let's look at the other end. In the video you saw that nine-pound or eight-pound Pointer airplane surveillance drone that Keenan has developed and just done a remarkable job. Where some have servos that have gotten down to, oh, 18 or 25 grams, his weigh one-third of a gram. And what he's going to bring out here is a surveillance drone that weighs about 2 ounces \u2014 that includes the video camera, the batteries that run it, the telemetry, the receiver and so on. And we'll fly it, we hope, with the same success that we had last night when we did the practice. So Matt Keenan, just any time you're \u2014 all right \u2014 ready to let her go. But first, we're going to make sure that it's appearing on the screen, so you see what it sees. You can imagine yourself being a mouse or fly inside of it, looking out of its camera. Matt Keenan: It's switched on. PM: But now we're trying to get the video. There we go. MK: Can you bring up the house lights? PM: Yeah, the house lights and we'll see you all better and be able to fly the plane better. MK: All right, we'll try to do a few laps around and bring it back in. Here we go. (Applause) PM: The video worked right for the first few and I don't know why it \u2014 there it goes. Oh, that was only a minute, but I think you'd be safe to have that near the end of the flight, perhaps. We get to do the classic. All right. If this hits you, it will not hurt you. (Laughter) OK. (Applause) Thank you very much. Thank you. (Applause)But now, as they say in infomercials, we have something much better for you, which we're working on: planes that are only six inches \u2014 15 centimeters \u2014 in size. And Matt's plane was on the cover of Popular Science last month, showing what this can lead to. And in a while, something this size will have GPS and a video camera in it. We've had one of these fly nine miles through the air at 35 miles an hour with just a little battery in it. But there's a lot of technology going. There are just milestones along the way of some remarkable things. This one doesn't have the video in it, but you get a little feel from what it can do. OK, here we go. (Laughter) MK: Sorry. OK. (Applause) PM: If you can pass it down when you're done. Yeah, I think \u2014 I lost a little orientation; I looked up into this light. It hit the building. And the building was poorly placed, actually. (Laughter) But you're beginning to see what can be done. We're working on projects now \u2014 even wing-flapping things the size of hawk moths \u2014 DARPA contracts, working with Caltech, UCLA.Where all this leads, I don't know. Is it practical? I don't know. But like any basic research, when you're really forced to do things that are way beyond existing technology, you can get there with micro-technology, nanotechnology. You can do amazing things when you realize what nature has been doing all along. As you get to these small scales, you realize we have a lot to learn from nature \u2014 not with 747s \u2014 but when you get down to the nature's realm, nature has 200 million years of experience. It never makes a mistake. Because if you make a mistake, you don't leave any progeny. We should have nothing but success stories from nature, for you or for birds, and we're learning a lot from its fascinating subjects.In concluding, I want to get back to the big picture and I have just two final slides to try and put it in perspective. The first I'll just read. At last, I put in three sentences and had it say what I wanted. Over billions of years on a unique sphere, chance has painted a thin covering of life \u2014 complex, improbable, wonderful and fragile. Suddenly, we humans \u2014 a recently arrived species, no longer subject to the checks and balances inherent in nature \u2014 have grown in population, technology and intelligence to a position of terrible power. We now wield the paintbrush. And that's serious: we're not very bright. We're short on wisdom; we're high on technology. Where's it going to lead?Well, inspired by the sentences, I decided to wield the paintbrush. Every 25 years I do a picture. Here's the one \u2014 tries to show that the world isn't getting any bigger. Sort of a timeline, very non-linear scale, nature rates and trilobites and dinosaurs, and eventually we saw some humans with caves ... Birds were flying overhead, after pterosaurs. And then we get to the civilization above the little TV set with a gun on it. Then traffic jams, and power systems, and some dots for digital. Where it's going to lead \u2014 I have no idea. And so I just put robotic and natural cockroaches out there, but you can fill in whatever you want. This is not a forecast. This is a warning, and we have to think seriously about it. And that time when this is happening is not 100 years or 500 years. Things are going on this decade, next decade; it's a very short time that we have to decide what we are going to do. And if we can get some agreement on where we want the world to be \u2014 desirable, sustainable when your kids reach your age \u2014 I think we actually can reach it. Now, I said this was a warning, not a forecast. That was before \u2014 I painted this before we started in on making robotic versions of hawk moths and cockroaches, and now I'm beginning to wonder seriously \u2014 was this more of a forecast than I wanted? I personally think the surviving intelligent life form on earth is not going to be carbon-based; it's going to be silicon-based. And so where it all goes, I don't know.The one final bit of sparkle we'll put in at the very end here is an utterly impractical flight vehicle, which is a little ornithopter wing-flapping device that \u2014 rubber-band powered \u2014 that we'll show you. MK: 32 gram. Sorry, one gram. PM: Last night we gave it a few too many turns and it tried to bash the roof out also. It's about a gram. The tube there's hollow, about paper-thin. And if this lands on you, I assure you it will not hurt you. But if you reach out to grab it or hold it, you will destroy it. So, be gentle, just act like a wooden Indian or something. And when it comes down \u2014 and we'll see how it goes. We consider this to be sort of the spirit of TED. (Applause) And you wonder, is it practical? And it turns out if I had not been \u2014 (Laughter) (Applause) Unfortunately, we have some light bulb changes. We can probably get it down, but it's possible it's gone up to a greater destiny up there \u2014 (Laughter) \u2014 than it ever had. And I wanted to make \u2014 (Applause) just \u2014 (Applause)But I want to make just two points. One is, you think it's frivolous; there's nothing to it. And yet if I had not been making ornithopters like that, a little bit cruder, in 1939 \u2014 a long, long time ago \u2014 there wouldn't have been a Gossamer Condor, there wouldn't have been an Albatross, a Solar Challenger, there wouldn't be an Impact car, there wouldn't be a mandate on zero-emission vehicles in California. A lot of these things \u2014 or similar \u2014 would have happened some time, probably a decade later. I didn't realize at the time I was doing inquiry-based, hands-on things with teams, like they're trying to get in education systems. So I think that, as a symbol, it's important. And I believe that also is important. You can think of it as a sort of a symbol for learning and TED that somehow gets you thinking of technology and nature, and puts it all together in things that are \u2014 that make this conference, I think, more important than any that's taken place in this country in this decade. Thank you.

But one thing for sure:\n\n00:00:22.958 --> 00:00:25.958\nit's the era of change. There's more change going on\n\n00:00:25.958 --> 00:00:31.958\nthan ever has occurred in the history of human life on earth.\n\n00:00:31.958 --> 00:00:34.958\nAnd you all sort of know it, but it's hard to get it\n\n00:00:34.958 --> 00:00:36.958\nso that you really understand it.\n\n00:00:36.958 --> 00:00:40.958\nAnd I've tried to put together something that's a good start for this.\n\n00:00:41.958 --> 00:00:45.958\nI've tried to show in this -- though the color doesn't come out --\n\n00:00:45.958 --> 00:00:49.958\nthat what I'm concerned with is the little 50-year time bubble\n\n00:00:49.958 --> 00:00:53.958\nthat you are in. You tend to be interested in a generation past,\n\n00:00:53.958 --> 00:00:57.958\na generation future -- your parents, your kids, things you can change\n\n00:00:57.958 --> 00:00:59.958\nover the next few decades -- and this 50-year time bubble\n\n00:00:59.958 --> 00:01:03.958\nyou kind of move along in. And in that 50 years,\n\n00:01:03.958 --> 00:01:07.958\nif you look at the population curve, you find the population of humans\n\n00:01:07.958 --> 00:01:11.958\non the earth more than doubles and we're up three-and-a-half times\n\n00:01:12.958 --> 00:01:15.958\nsince I was born. When you have a new baby,\n\n00:01:15.958 --> 00:01:18.958\nby the time that kid gets out of high school\n\n00:01:19.958 --> 00:01:22.958\nmore people will be added than existed on earth when I was born.\n\n00:01:23.958 --> 00:01:25.958\nThis is unprecedented, and it's big.\n\n00:01:26.958 --> 00:01:29.958\nWhere it goes in the future is questioned. So that's the human part.\n\n00:01:30.958 --> 00:01:34.958\nNow, the human part related to animals: look at the left side of that.\n\n00:01:35.958 --> 00:01:38.958\nWhat I call the human portion -- humans and their livestock and pets --\n\n00:01:38.958 --> 00:01:42.958\nversus the natural portion -- all the other wild animals and just --\n\n00:01:42.958 --> 00:01:46.958\nthese are vertebrates and all the birds, etc.,\n\n00:01:46.958 --> 00:01:50.958\nin the land and air, not in the water. How does it balance?\n\n00:01:50.958 --> 00:01:55.958\nCertainly, 10,000 years ago, the civilization's beginning,\n\n00:01:55.958 --> 00:02:00.958\nthe human portion was less than one tenth of one percent. Let's look at it now.\n\n00:02:00.958 --> 00:02:04.958\nYou follow this curve and you see the whiter spot in the middle --\n\n00:02:04.958 --> 00:02:09.958\nthat's your 50-year time bubble. Humans, livestock and pets\n\n00:02:09.958 --> 00:02:12.958\nare now 97 percent of that integrated total mass on earth\n\n00:02:13.958 --> 00:02:17.958\nand all wild nature is three percent. We have won. The next generation\n\n00:02:17.958 --> 00:02:19.958\ndoesn't even have to worry about this game -- it is over.\n\n00:02:20.958 --> 00:02:24.958\nAnd the biggest problem came in the last 25 years:\n\n00:02:24.958 --> 00:02:27.958\nit went from 25 percent up to that 97 percent.\n\n00:02:27.958 --> 00:02:32.958\nAnd this really is a sobering picture upon realizing that we, humans,\n\n00:02:33.958 --> 00:02:37.958\nare in charge of life on earth; we're like the capricious Gods\n\n00:02:37.958 --> 00:02:41.958\nof old Greek myths, kind of playing with life --\n\n00:02:42.958 --> 00:02:46.958\nand not a great deal of wisdom injected into it.\n\n00:02:46.958 --> 00:02:50.958\nNow, the third curve is information technology.\n\n00:02:50.958 --> 00:02:53.958\nThis is Moore's Law plotted here, which relates to density\n\n00:02:54.958 --> 00:02:57.958\nof information, but it has been pretty good for showing\n\n00:02:57.958 --> 00:02:59.958\na lot of other things about information technology --\n\n00:03:00.958 --> 00:03:03.958\ncomputers, their use, Internet, etc. And what's important\n\n00:03:04.958 --> 00:03:07.958\nis it just goes straight up through the top of the curve,\n\n00:03:07.958 --> 00:03:12.958\nand has no real limits to it. Now try and contrast these.\n\n00:03:13.958 --> 00:03:15.958\nThis is the size of the earth going through that same --\n\n00:03:15.958 --> 00:03:17.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:03:17.958 --> 00:03:23.958\n-- frame. And to make it really clear, I've put all four on one graph.\n\n00:03:23.958 --> 00:03:25.958\nThere's no need to see the little detailed words on it.\n\n00:03:26.958 --> 00:03:30.958\nThat first one is humans-versus-nature;\n\n00:03:31.958 --> 00:03:34.958\nwe've won, there's no more gain. Human population.\n\n00:03:34.958 --> 00:03:36.958\nAnd so if you're looking for growth industries to get into,\n\n00:03:36.958 --> 00:03:41.958\nthat's not a good one -- protecting natural creatures. Human population\n\n00:03:41.958 --> 00:03:43.958\nis going up; it's going to continue for quite a while.\n\n00:03:44.958 --> 00:03:49.958\nGood business in obstetricians, morticians, and farming, housing, etc. --\n\n00:03:50.958 --> 00:03:55.958\nthey all deal with human bodies, which require being fed,\n\n00:03:55.958 --> 00:04:00.958\ntransported, housed and so on. And the information technology,\n\n00:04:00.958 --> 00:04:03.958\nwhich connects to our brains, has no limit -- now, that is a wonderful\n\n00:04:04.958 --> 00:04:06.958\nfield to be in. You're looking for growth opportunity?\n\n00:04:06.958 --> 00:04:08.958\nIt's just going up through the roof.\n\n00:04:09.958 --> 00:04:12.958\nAnd then, the size of the Earth. Somehow making these all compatible\n\n00:04:12.958 --> 00:04:16.958\nwith the Earth looks like a pretty bad industry to be involved with.\n\n00:04:17.958 --> 00:04:20.958\nSo, that's the stage out of all this. I find,\n\n00:04:21.958 --> 00:04:24.958\nfor reasons I don't understand, I really do have a goal.\n\n00:04:24.958 --> 00:04:28.958\nAnd the goal is that the world be desirable and sustainable\n\n00:04:28.958 --> 00:04:32.958\nwhen my kids reach my age -- and I think that's -- in other words,\n\n00:04:32.958 --> 00:04:35.958\nthe next generation. I think that's a goal that we probably all share.\n\n00:04:35.958 --> 00:04:38.958\nI think it's a hopeless goal. Technologically, it's achievable;\n\n00:04:38.958 --> 00:04:41.958\neconomically, it's achievable; politically,\n\n00:04:41.958 --> 00:04:45.958\nit means sort of the habits, institutions of people -- it's impossible.\n\n00:04:46.958 --> 00:04:48.958\nThe institutions of the past with all their inertia\n\n00:04:48.958 --> 00:04:51.958\nare just irrelevant for the future, except they're there\n\n00:04:52.958 --> 00:04:58.958\nand we have to deal with them. I spend about 15 percent of my time\n\n00:04:58.958 --> 00:05:01.958\ntrying to save the world, the other 85 percent, the usual --\n\n00:05:01.958 --> 00:05:04.958\nand whatever else we devote ourselves to.\n\n00:05:04.958 --> 00:05:09.958\nAnd in that 15 percent, the main focus is on human mind, thinking skills,\n\n00:05:10.958 --> 00:05:13.958\nsomehow trying to unleash kids from the straightjacket of school,\n\n00:05:13.958 --> 00:05:16.958\nwhich is putting information and dogma into them,\n\n00:05:16.958 --> 00:05:19.958\nget them so they really think, ask tough questions, argue\n\n00:05:19.958 --> 00:05:23.958\nabout serious subjects, don't believe everything that's in the book,\n\n00:05:23.958 --> 00:05:26.958\nthink broadly or creative. They can be.\n\n00:05:26.958 --> 00:05:30.958\nOur school systems are very flawed and do not reward you\n\n00:05:30.958 --> 00:05:32.958\nfor the things that are important in life\n\n00:05:32.958 --> 00:05:34.958\nor for the survival of civilization; they reward you\n\n00:05:34.958 --> 00:05:38.958\nfor a lot of learning and sopping up stuff.\n\n00:05:39.958 --> 00:05:43.958\nWe can't go into that today because there isn't time --\n\n00:05:43.958 --> 00:05:46.958\nit's a broad subject. One thing for sure, in the future\n\n00:05:46.958 --> 00:05:53.958\nthere is an essential feature -- necessary, but not sufficient --\n\n00:05:53.958 --> 00:05:56.958\nwhich is doing more with less. We've got to be doing things\n\n00:05:57.958 --> 00:05:59.958\nwith more efficiency using less energy, less material.\n\n00:05:59.958 --> 00:06:02.958\nYour great-great grandparents got by on muscle power,\n\n00:06:03.958 --> 00:06:06.958\nand yet we all think there's this huge power that's essential\n\n00:06:07.958 --> 00:06:10.958\nfor our lifestyle. And with all the wonderful technology we have\n\n00:06:11.958 --> 00:06:18.958\nwe can do things that are much more efficient: conserve, recycle, etc.\n\n00:06:19.958 --> 00:06:22.958\nLet me just rush very quickly through things that we've done.\n\n00:06:22.958 --> 00:06:25.958\nHuman-powered airplane -- Gossamer Condor sort of started me\n\n00:06:25.958 --> 00:06:30.958\nin this direction in 1976 and 77,\n\n00:06:31.958 --> 00:06:32.958\nwinning the Kremer prize in aviation history,\n\n00:06:33.958 --> 00:06:35.958\nfollowed by the Albatross. And we began\n\n00:06:36.958 --> 00:06:39.958\nmaking various odd planes and creatures.\n\n00:06:39.958 --> 00:06:43.958\nHere's a giant flying replica of a pterosaur that has no tail.\n\n00:06:44.958 --> 00:06:47.958\nTrying to have it fly straight is like trying to shoot an arrow\n\n00:06:47.958 --> 00:06:50.958\nwith the feathered end forward. It was a tough job,\n\n00:06:50.958 --> 00:06:53.958\nand boy it made me have a lot of respect for nature.\n\n00:06:53.958 --> 00:06:56.958\nThis was the full size of the original creature.\n\n00:06:57.958 --> 00:06:59.958\nWe did things on land, in the air, on water --\n\n00:07:00.958 --> 00:07:04.958\nvehicles of all different kinds, usually with some electronics\n\n00:07:04.958 --> 00:07:06.958\nor electric power systems in them. I find they're all the same,\n\n00:07:07.958 --> 00:07:11.958\nwhether its land, air or water.\n\n00:07:11.958 --> 00:07:15.958\nI'll be focusing on the air here. This is a solar-powered airplane --\n\n00:07:15.958 --> 00:07:18.958\n165 miles carrying a person from France to England\n\n00:07:18.958 --> 00:07:21.958\nas a symbol that solar power is going to be an important part\n\n00:07:22.958 --> 00:07:25.958\nof our future. Then we did the solar car for General Motors --\n\n00:07:25.958 --> 00:07:28.958\nthe Sunracer -- that won the race in Australia.\n\n00:07:29.958 --> 00:07:31.958\nWe got a lot of people thinking about electric cars,\n\n00:07:31.958 --> 00:07:34.958\nwhat you could do with them. A few years later, when we suggested to GM that\n\n00:07:34.958 --> 00:07:36.958\nnow is the time and we could do a thing called the Impact,\n\n00:07:37.958 --> 00:07:40.958\nthey sponsored it, and here's the Impact that we developed with them\n\n00:07:40.958 --> 00:07:44.958\non their programs. This is the demonstrator. And they put huge effort\n\n00:07:44.958 --> 00:07:47.958\ninto turning it into a commercial product.\n\n00:07:47.958 --> 00:07:52.958\nWith that preamble, let's show the first two-minute videotape,\n\n00:07:52.958 --> 00:07:54.958\nwhich shows a little airplane for surveillance\n\n00:07:55.958 --> 00:07:57.958\nand moving to a giant airplane.\n\n00:07:59.958 --> 00:08:03.958\nNarrator: A tiny airplane, the AV Pointer serves for surveillance --\n\n00:08:03.958 --> 00:08:07.958\nin effect, a pair of roving eyeglasses. A cutting-edge example\n\n00:08:07.958 --> 00:08:10.958\nof where miniaturization can lead if the operator is remote\n\n00:08:10.958 --> 00:08:13.958\nfrom the vehicle. It is convenient to carry, assemble\n\n00:08:13.958 --> 00:08:18.958\nand launch by hand. Battery-powered, it is silent and rarely noticed.\n\n00:08:19.958 --> 00:08:22.958\nIt sends high-resolution video pictures back to the operator.\n\n00:08:22.958 --> 00:08:25.958\nWith onboard GPS, it can navigate autonomously,\n\n00:08:26.958 --> 00:08:29.958\nand it is rugged enough to self-land without damage.\n\n00:08:31.958 --> 00:08:33.958\nThe modern sailplane is superbly efficient.\n\n00:08:34.958 --> 00:08:38.958\nSome can glide as flat as 60 feet forward for every foot of descent.\n\n00:08:39.958 --> 00:08:40.958\nThey are powered only by the energy\n\n00:08:40.958 --> 00:08:42.958\nthey can extract from the atmosphere --\n\n00:08:43.958 --> 00:08:46.958\nan atmosphere nature stirs up by solar energy.\n\n00:08:46.958 --> 00:08:49.958\nHumans and soaring birds have found nature to be generous\n\n00:08:49.958 --> 00:08:53.958\nin providing replenishable energy. Sailplanes have flown\n\n00:08:53.958 --> 00:08:57.958\nover 1,000 miles, and the altitude record is over 50,000 feet.\n\n00:08:57.958 --> 00:09:02.958\n(Music)\n\n00:09:02.958 --> 00:09:04.958\nThe Solar Challenger was made to serve as a symbol\n\n00:09:05.958 --> 00:09:08.958\nthat photovoltaic cells can produce real power\n\n00:09:08.958 --> 00:09:10.958\nand will be part of the world's energy future.\n\n00:09:11.958 --> 00:09:15.958\nIn 1981, it flew 163 miles from Paris to England,\n\n00:09:15.958 --> 00:09:17.958\nsolely on the power of sunbeams,\n\n00:09:17.958 --> 00:09:20.958\nand established a basis for the Pathfinder.\n\n00:09:20.958 --> 00:09:23.958\n(Music)\n\n00:09:23.958 --> 00:09:27.958\nThe message from all these vehicles is that ideas and technology\n\n00:09:27.958 --> 00:09:31.958\ncan be harnessed to produce remarkable gains in doing more with less --\n\n00:09:32.958 --> 00:09:35.958\ngains that can help us attain a desirable balance\n\n00:09:35.958 --> 00:09:38.958\nbetween technology and nature. The stakes are high\n\n00:09:38.958 --> 00:09:40.958\nas we speed toward a challenging future.\n\n00:09:42.958 --> 00:09:45.958\nBuckminster Fuller said it clearly: \"there are no passengers\n\n00:09:45.958 --> 00:09:49.958\non spaceship Earth, only crew. We, the crew,\n\n00:09:49.958 --> 00:09:53.958\ncan and must do more with less -- much less.\"\n\n00:09:55.958 --> 00:09:57.958\nPaul MacCready: If we could have the second video, the one-minute,\n\n00:09:58.958 --> 00:10:02.958\nput in as quickly as you can, which -- this will show\n\n00:10:02.958 --> 00:10:11.958\nthe Pathfinder airplane in some flights this past year in Hawaii,\n\n00:10:11.958 --> 00:10:15.958\nand will show a sequence of some of the beauty behind it\n\n00:10:15.958 --> 00:10:19.958\nafter it had just flown to 71,530 feet --\n\n00:10:20.958 --> 00:10:23.958\nhigher than any propeller airplane has ever flown.\n\n00:10:23.958 --> 00:10:25.958\nIt's amazing: just on the puny power of the sun --\n\n00:10:26.958 --> 00:10:29.958\nby having a super lightweight plane, you're able to get it up there.\n\n00:10:31.958 --> 00:10:34.958\nIt's part of a long-term program NASA sponsored.\n\n00:10:34.958 --> 00:10:39.958\nAnd we worked very closely with the whole thing being a team effort,\n\n00:10:40.958 --> 00:10:44.958\nand with wonderful results like that flight.\n\n00:10:45.958 --> 00:10:47.958\nAnd we're working on a bigger plane -- 220-foot span --\n\n00:10:48.958 --> 00:10:50.958\nand an intermediate-size, one with a regenerative fuel cell\n\n00:10:51.958 --> 00:10:54.958\nthat can store excess energy during the day, feed it back at night,\n\n00:10:54.958 --> 00:10:57.958\nand stay up 65,000 feet for months at a time.\n\n00:10:58.958 --> 00:11:03.958\n(Music)\n\n00:11:03.958 --> 00:11:05.958\nRay Morgan's voice will come in here.\n\n00:11:05.958 --> 00:11:07.958\nThere he's the project manager. Anything they do\n\n00:11:07.958 --> 00:11:12.958\nis certainly a team effort. He ran this program. Here's ...\n\n00:11:14.958 --> 00:11:17.958\nsome things he showed as a celebration at the very end.\n\n00:11:18.958 --> 00:11:20.958\nRay Morgan: We'd just ended a seven-month deployment of Hawaii.\n\n00:11:22.958 --> 00:11:25.958\nFor those who live on the mainland, it was tough being away from home.\n\n00:11:28.958 --> 00:11:32.958\nThe friendly support, the quiet confidence, congenial hospitality\n\n00:11:32.958 --> 00:11:34.958\nshown by our Hawaiian and military hosts --\n\n00:11:34.958 --> 00:11:37.958\n(Music)\n\n00:11:37.958 --> 00:11:38.958\nthis is starting --\n\n00:11:38.958 --> 00:11:40.958\nmade the experience enjoyable and unforgettable.\n\n00:11:41.958 --> 00:11:45.958\nPM: We have real-time IR scans going out through the Internet\n\n00:11:45.958 --> 00:11:48.958\nwhile the plane is flying. And it's exploring\n\n00:11:48.958 --> 00:11:51.958\nwithout polluting the stratosphere. That's its goal: the stratosphere,\n\n00:11:51.958 --> 00:11:55.958\nthe blanket that really controls the radiation of the earth\n\n00:11:55.958 --> 00:11:58.958\nand permits life on earth to be the success that it is --\n\n00:11:59.958 --> 00:12:04.958\nprobing that is very important. And also we consider it\n\n00:12:04.958 --> 00:12:08.958\nas a sort of poor man's stationary satellite,\n\n00:12:08.958 --> 00:12:11.958\nbecause it can stay right overhead for months at a time,\n\n00:12:12.958 --> 00:12:17.958\n2,000 times closer than the real GFC synchronous satellite.\n\n00:12:17.958 --> 00:12:21.958\nWe couldn't bring one here to fly it and show you.\n\n00:12:21.958 --> 00:12:23.958\nBut now let's look at the other end.\n\n00:12:25.958 --> 00:12:29.958\nIn the video you saw that nine-pound or eight-pound Pointer airplane\n\n00:12:29.958 --> 00:12:33.958\nsurveillance drone that Keenan has developed\n\n00:12:34.958 --> 00:12:37.958\nand just done a remarkable job. Where some have servos\n\n00:12:37.958 --> 00:12:40.958\nthat have gotten down to, oh, 18 or 25 grams,\n\n00:12:40.958 --> 00:12:44.958\nhis weigh one-third of a gram. And what he's going to bring out here\n\n00:12:45.958 --> 00:12:49.958\nis a surveillance drone that weighs about 2 ounces --\n\n00:12:49.958 --> 00:12:52.958\nthat includes the video camera, the batteries that run it,\n\n00:12:52.958 --> 00:12:59.958\nthe telemetry, the receiver and so on. And we'll fly it, we hope,\n\n00:12:59.958 --> 00:13:02.958\nwith the same success that we had last night when we did the practice.\n\n00:13:03.958 --> 00:13:06.958\nSo Matt Keenan, just any time you're --\n\n00:13:06.958 --> 00:13:07.958\nall right\n\n00:13:07.958 --> 00:13:11.958\n-- ready to let her go. But first, we're going to make sure\n\n00:13:11.958 --> 00:13:15.958\nthat it's appearing on the screen, so you see what it sees.\n\n00:13:15.958 --> 00:13:18.958\nYou can imagine yourself being a mouse or fly inside of it,\n\n00:13:19.958 --> 00:13:20.958\nlooking out of its camera.\n\n00:13:26.958 --> 00:13:27.958\nMatt Keenan: It's switched on.\n\n00:13:28.958 --> 00:13:33.958\nPM: But now we're trying to get the video. There we go.\n\n00:13:34.958 --> 00:13:36.958\nMK: Can you bring up the house lights?\n\n00:13:36.958 --> 00:13:38.958\nPM: Yeah, the house lights and we'll see you all better\n\n00:13:39.958 --> 00:13:40.958\nand be able to fly the plane better.\n\n00:13:41.958 --> 00:13:46.958\nMK: All right, we'll try to do a few laps around and bring it back in.\n\n00:13:47.958 --> 00:13:48.958\nHere we go.\n\n00:13:53.958 --> 00:14:01.958\n(Applause)\n\n00:14:01.958 --> 00:14:05.958\nPM: The video worked right for the first few and I don't know why it --\n\n00:14:07.958 --> 00:14:08.958\nthere it goes.\n\n00:14:14.958 --> 00:14:18.958\nOh, that was only a minute, but I think you'd be safe\n\n00:14:18.958 --> 00:14:20.958\nto have that near the end of the flight, perhaps.\n\n00:14:23.958 --> 00:14:24.958\nWe get to do the classic.\n\n00:14:28.958 --> 00:14:29.958\nAll right.\n\n00:14:29.958 --> 00:14:30.958\nIf this hits you, it will not hurt you.\n\n00:14:31.958 --> 00:14:33.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:14:34.958 --> 00:14:35.958\nOK.\n\n00:14:35.958 --> 00:14:51.958\n(Applause)\n\n00:14:51.958 --> 00:14:52.958\nThank you very much. Thank you.\n\n00:14:52.958 --> 00:14:59.958\n(Applause)\n\n00:14:59.958 --> 00:15:01.958\nBut now, as they say in infomercials,\n\n00:15:02.958 --> 00:15:05.958\nwe have something much better for you, which we're working on:\n\n00:15:06.958 --> 00:15:10.958\nplanes that are only six inches -- 15 centimeters -- in size.\n\n00:15:11.958 --> 00:15:16.958\nAnd Matt's plane was on the cover of Popular Science last month,\n\n00:15:17.958 --> 00:15:21.958\nshowing what this can lead to. And in a while, something this size\n\n00:15:21.958 --> 00:15:27.958\nwill have GPS and a video camera in it. We've had one of these fly\n\n00:15:27.958 --> 00:15:30.958\nnine miles through the air at 35 miles an hour\n\n00:15:30.958 --> 00:15:32.958\nwith just a little battery in it.\n\n00:15:32.958 --> 00:15:33.958\nBut there's a lot of technology going.\n\n00:15:33.958 --> 00:15:38.958\nThere are just milestones along the way of some remarkable things.\n\n00:15:38.958 --> 00:15:41.958\nThis one doesn't have the video in it,\n\n00:15:41.958 --> 00:15:44.958\nbut you get a little feel from what it can do.\n\n00:15:45.958 --> 00:15:47.958\nOK, here we go.\n\n00:15:51.958 --> 00:15:57.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:15:57.958 --> 00:15:58.958\nMK: Sorry.\n\n00:15:58.958 --> 00:15:59.958\nOK.\n\n00:15:59.958 --> 00:16:03.958\n(Applause)\n\n00:16:03.958 --> 00:16:07.958\nPM: If you can pass it down when you're done. Yeah, I think --\n\n00:16:07.958 --> 00:16:10.958\nI lost a little orientation; I looked up into this light.\n\n00:16:11.958 --> 00:16:14.958\nIt hit the building. And the building was poorly placed, actually.\n\n00:16:15.958 --> 00:16:17.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:16:17.958 --> 00:16:21.958\nBut you're beginning to see what can be done.\n\n00:16:21.958 --> 00:16:23.958\nWe're working on projects now -- even wing-flapping things\n\n00:16:23.958 --> 00:16:28.958\nthe size of hawk moths -- DARPA contracts, working with Caltech, UCLA.\n\n00:16:29.958 --> 00:16:32.958\nWhere all this leads, I don't know. Is it practical? I don't know.\n\n00:16:32.958 --> 00:16:36.958\nBut like any basic research, when you're really forced to do things\n\n00:16:36.958 --> 00:16:38.958\nthat are way beyond existing technology,\n\n00:16:38.958 --> 00:16:41.958\nyou can get there with micro-technology, nanotechnology.\n\n00:16:42.958 --> 00:16:44.958\nYou can do amazing things when you realize\n\n00:16:44.958 --> 00:16:47.958\nwhat nature has been doing all along. As you get to these small scales,\n\n00:16:47.958 --> 00:16:51.958\nyou realize we have a lot to learn from nature -- not with 747s --\n\n00:16:51.958 --> 00:16:53.958\nbut when you get down to the nature's realm,\n\n00:16:54.958 --> 00:16:57.958\nnature has 200 million years of experience.\n\n00:16:57.958 --> 00:17:00.958\nIt never makes a mistake. Because if you make a mistake,\n\n00:17:00.958 --> 00:17:01.958\nyou don't leave any progeny.\n\n00:17:02.958 --> 00:17:04.958\nWe should have nothing but success stories from nature,\n\n00:17:05.958 --> 00:17:08.958\nfor you or for birds, and we're learning a lot\n\n00:17:09.958 --> 00:17:11.958\nfrom its fascinating subjects.\n\n00:17:11.958 --> 00:17:17.958\nIn concluding, I want to get back to the big picture\n\n00:17:17.958 --> 00:17:23.958\nand I have just two final slides to try and put it in perspective.\n\n00:17:24.958 --> 00:17:28.958\nThe first I'll just read. At last, I put in three sentences\n\n00:17:28.958 --> 00:17:30.958\nand had it say what I wanted.\n\n00:17:30.958 --> 00:17:33.958\nOver billions of years on a unique sphere, chance has painted\n\n00:17:33.958 --> 00:17:37.958\na thin covering of life -- complex, improbable, wonderful\n\n00:17:37.958 --> 00:17:40.958\nand fragile. Suddenly, we humans -- a recently arrived species,\n\n00:17:40.958 --> 00:17:44.958\nno longer subject to the checks and balances inherent in nature --\n\n00:17:44.958 --> 00:17:47.958\nhave grown in population, technology and intelligence\n\n00:17:48.958 --> 00:17:51.958\nto a position of terrible power. We now wield the paintbrush.\n\n00:17:52.958 --> 00:17:56.958\nAnd that's serious: we're not very bright. We're short on wisdom;\n\n00:17:56.958 --> 00:17:59.958\nwe're high on technology. Where's it going to lead?\n\n00:18:00.958 --> 00:18:04.958\nWell, inspired by the sentences, I decided to wield the paintbrush.\n\n00:18:04.958 --> 00:18:07.958\nEvery 25 years I do a picture. Here's the one --\n\n00:18:07.958 --> 00:18:09.958\ntries to show that the world isn't getting any bigger.\n\n00:18:10.958 --> 00:18:14.958\nSort of a timeline, very non-linear scale, nature rates\n\n00:18:14.958 --> 00:18:18.958\nand trilobites and dinosaurs, and eventually we saw some humans\n\n00:18:18.958 --> 00:18:22.958\nwith caves ... Birds were flying overhead, after pterosaurs.\n\n00:18:23.958 --> 00:18:26.958\nAnd then we get to the civilization above the little TV set\n\n00:18:26.958 --> 00:18:30.958\nwith a gun on it. Then traffic jams, and power systems,\n\n00:18:30.958 --> 00:18:34.958\nand some dots for digital. Where it's going to lead -- I have no idea.\n\n00:18:35.958 --> 00:18:39.958\nAnd so I just put robotic and natural cockroaches out there,\n\n00:18:39.958 --> 00:18:42.958\nbut you can fill in whatever you want. This is not a forecast.\n\n00:18:42.958 --> 00:18:46.958\nThis is a warning, and we have to think seriously about it.\n\n00:18:46.958 --> 00:18:50.958\nAnd that time when this is happening is not 100 years or 500 years.\n\n00:18:50.958 --> 00:18:55.958\nThings are going on this decade, next decade;\n\n00:18:56.958 --> 00:18:59.958\nit's a very short time that we have to decide what we are going to do.\n\n00:19:01.958 --> 00:19:04.958\nAnd if we can get some agreement on where we want the world to be --\n\n00:19:05.958 --> 00:19:07.958\ndesirable, sustainable when your kids reach your age --\n\n00:19:08.958 --> 00:19:12.958\nI think we actually can reach it. Now, I said this was a warning,\n\n00:19:12.958 --> 00:19:14.958\nnot a forecast. That was before --\n\n00:19:14.958 --> 00:19:18.958\nI painted this before we started in on making robotic versions\n\n00:19:19.958 --> 00:19:22.958\nof hawk moths and cockroaches, and now I'm beginning to wonder\n\n00:19:23.958 --> 00:19:25.958\nseriously -- was this more of a forecast than I wanted?\n\n00:19:25.958 --> 00:19:28.958\nI personally think the surviving intelligent life form on earth\n\n00:19:28.958 --> 00:19:31.958\nis not going to be carbon-based; it's going to be silicon-based.\n\n00:19:32.958 --> 00:19:37.958\nAnd so where it all goes, I don't know.\n\n00:19:38.958 --> 00:19:43.958\nThe one final bit of sparkle we'll put in at the very end here\n\n00:19:44.958 --> 00:19:48.958\nis an utterly impractical flight vehicle,\n\n00:19:48.958 --> 00:19:54.958\nwhich is a little ornithopter wing-flapping device that --\n\n00:19:55.958 --> 00:20:00.958\nrubber-band powered -- that we'll show you.\n\n00:20:05.958 --> 00:20:07.958\nMK: 32 gram. Sorry, one gram.\n\n00:20:17.958 --> 00:20:20.958\nPM: Last night we gave it a few too many turns\n\n00:20:20.958 --> 00:20:24.958\nand it tried to bash the roof out also. It's about a gram.\n\n00:20:25.958 --> 00:20:30.958\nThe tube there's hollow, about paper-thin.\n\n00:20:31.958 --> 00:20:33.958\nAnd if this lands on you, I assure you it will not hurt you.\n\n00:20:34.958 --> 00:20:37.958\nBut if you reach out to grab it or hold it, you will destroy it.\n\n00:20:37.958 --> 00:20:42.958\nSo, be gentle, just act like a wooden Indian or something.\n\n00:20:42.958 --> 00:20:45.958\nAnd when it comes down -- and we'll see how it goes.\n\n00:20:48.958 --> 00:20:53.958\nWe consider this to be sort of the spirit of TED.\n\n00:20:53.958 --> 00:20:58.958\n(Applause)\n\n00:20:58.958 --> 00:21:01.958\nAnd you wonder, is it practical? And it turns out if I had not been --\n\n00:21:02.958 --> 00:21:08.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:21:08.958 --> 00:21:14.958\n(Applause)\n\n00:21:14.958 --> 00:21:17.958\nUnfortunately, we have some light bulb changes.\n\n00:21:17.958 --> 00:21:18.958\nWe can probably get it down,\n\n00:21:18.958 --> 00:21:21.958\nbut it's possible it's gone up to a greater destiny up there --\n\n00:21:21.958 --> 00:21:22.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:21:22.958 --> 00:21:25.958\n-- than it ever had. And I wanted to make --\n\n00:21:25.958 --> 00:21:28.958\n(Applause)\n\n00:21:28.958 --> 00:21:29.958\njust --\n\n00:21:29.958 --> 00:21:30.958\n(Applause)\n\n00:21:30.958 --> 00:21:36.958\nBut I want to make just two points. One is, you think it's frivolous;\n\n00:21:36.958 --> 00:21:39.958\nthere's nothing to it. And yet if I had not been making ornithopters\n\n00:21:39.958 --> 00:21:45.958\nlike that, a little bit cruder, in 1939 -- a long, long time ago --\n\n00:21:45.958 --> 00:21:47.958\nthere wouldn't have been a Gossamer Condor,\n\n00:21:47.958 --> 00:21:49.958\nthere wouldn't have been an Albatross, a Solar Challenger,\n\n00:21:49.958 --> 00:21:51.958\nthere wouldn't be an Impact car, there wouldn't be a mandate\n\n00:21:51.958 --> 00:21:54.958\non zero-emission vehicles in California.\n\n00:21:54.958 --> 00:21:56.958\nA lot of these things -- or similar -- would have happened some time,\n\n00:21:56.958 --> 00:21:59.958\nprobably a decade later. I didn't realize at the time\n\n00:21:59.958 --> 00:22:03.958\nI was doing inquiry-based, hands-on things with teams,\n\n00:22:03.958 --> 00:22:06.958\nlike they're trying to get in education systems.\n\n00:22:06.958 --> 00:22:09.958\nSo I think that, as a symbol, it's important.\n\n00:22:09.958 --> 00:22:12.958\nAnd I believe that also is important. You can think of it\n\n00:22:12.958 --> 00:22:19.958\nas a sort of a symbol for learning and TED\n\n00:22:19.958 --> 00:22:23.958\nthat somehow gets you thinking of technology and nature,\n\n00:22:24.958 --> 00:22:26.958\nand puts it all together in things that are --\n\n00:22:27.958 --> 00:22:29.958\nthat make this conference, I think, more important than any\n\n00:22:29.958 --> 00:22:32.958\nthat's taken place in this country in this decade.\n\n00:22:32.958 --> 00:22:33.958\nThank you.

And I realized how few of the grown-ups that I knew were able to withstand the tragedies that the war visited on them \u2014 how few of them could even resemble a normal, contented, satisfied, happy life once their job, their home, their security was destroyed by the war. So I became interested in understanding what contributed to a life that was worth living. And I tried, as a child, as a teenager, to read philosophy and to get involved in art and religion and many other ways that I could see as a possible answer to that question. And finally I ended up encountering psychology by chance.I was at a ski resort in Switzerland without any money to actually enjoy myself, because the snow had melted and I didn't have money to go to a movie. But I found that on the \u2014 I read in the newspapers that there was to be a presentation by someone in a place that I'd seen in the center of Zurich, and it was about flying saucers [that] he was going to talk. And I thought, well, since I can't go to the movies, at least I will go for free to listen to flying saucers. And the man who talked at that evening lecture was very interesting. Instead of talking about little green men, he talked about how the psyche of the Europeans had been traumatized by the war, and now they're projecting flying saucers into the sky. He talked about how the mandalas of ancient Hindu religion were kind of projected into the sky as an attempt to regain some sense of order after the chaos of war. And this seemed very interesting to me. And I started reading his books after that lecture. And that was Carl Jung, whose name or work I had no idea about.Then I came to this country to study psychology and I started trying to understand the roots of happiness. This is a typical result that many people have presented, and there are many variations on it. But this, for instance, shows that about 30 percent of the people surveyed in the United States since 1956 say that their life is very happy. And that hasn't changed at all. Whereas the personal income, on a scale that has been held constant to accommodate for inflation, has more than doubled, almost tripled, in that period. But you find essentially the same results, namely, that after a certain basic point \u2014 which corresponds more or less to just a few 1,000 dollars above the minimum poverty level \u2014 increases in material well-being don't seem to affect how happy people are. In fact, you can find that the lack of basic resources, material resources, contributes to unhappiness, but the increase in material resources does not increase happiness.So my research has been focused more on \u2014 after finding out these things that actually corresponded to my own experience, I tried to understand: where \u2014 in everyday life, in our normal experience \u2014 do we feel really happy? And to start those studies about 40 years ago, I began to look at creative people \u2014 first artists and scientists, and so forth \u2014 trying to understand what made them feel that it was worth essentially spending their life doing things for which many of them didn't expect either fame or fortune, but which made their life meaningful and worth doing.This was one of the leading composers of American music back in the '70s. And the interview was 40 pages long. But this little excerpt is a very good summary of what he was saying during the interview. And it describes how he feels when composing is going well. And he says by describing it as an ecstatic state.Now, \"ecstasy\" in Greek meant simply to stand to the side of something. And then it became essentially an analogy for a mental state where you feel that you are not doing your ordinary everyday routines. So ecstasy is essentially a stepping into an alternative reality. And it's interesting, if you think about it, how, when we think about the civilizations that we look up to as having been pinnacles of human achievement \u2014 whether it's China, Greece, the Hindu civilization, or the Mayas, or Egyptians \u2014 what we know about them is really about their ecstasies, not about their everyday life. We know the temples they built, where people could come to experience a different reality. We know about the circuses, the arenas, the theaters. These are the remains of civilizations and they are the places that people went to experience life in a more concentrated, more ordered form.Now, this man doesn't need to go to a place like this, which is also \u2014 this place, this arena, which is built like a Greek amphitheatre, is a place for ecstasy also. We are participating in a reality that is different from that of the everyday life that we're used to. But this man doesn't need to go there. He needs just a piece of paper where he can put down little marks, and as he does that, he can imagine sounds that had not existed before in that particular combination. So once he gets to that point of beginning to create, like Jennifer did in her improvisation, a new reality \u2014 that is, a moment of ecstasy \u2014 he enters that different reality. Now he says also that this is so intense an experience that it feels almost as if he didn't exist. And that sounds like a kind of a romantic exaggeration. But actually, our nervous system is incapable of processing more than about 110 bits of information per second. And in order to hear me and understand what I'm saying, you need to process about 60 bits per second. That's why you can't hear more than two people. You can't understand more than two people talking to you.Well, when you are really involved in this completely engaging process of creating something new, as this man is, he doesn't have enough attention left over to monitor how his body feels, or his problems at home. He can't feel even that he's hungry or tired. His body disappears, his identity disappears from his consciousness, because he doesn't have enough attention, like none of us do, to really do well something that requires a lot of concentration, and at the same time to feel that he exists. So existence is temporarily suspended. And he says that his hand seems to be moving by itself. Now, I could look at my hand for two weeks, and I wouldn't feel any awe or wonder, because I can't compose. (Laughter)So what it's telling you here is that obviously this automatic, spontaneous process that he's describing can only happen to someone who is very well trained and who has developed technique. And it has become a kind of a truism in the study of creativity that you can't be creating anything with less than 10 years of technical-knowledge immersion in a particular field. Whether it's mathematics or music, it takes that long to be able to begin to change something in a way that it's better than what was there before. Now, when that happens, he says the music just flows out. And because all of these people I started interviewing \u2014 this was an interview which is over 30 years old \u2014 so many of the people described this as a spontaneous flow that I called this type of experience the \"flow experience.\" And it happens in different realms.For instance, a poet describes it in this form. This is by a student of mine who interviewed some of the leading writers and poets in the United States. And it describes the same effortless, spontaneous feeling that you get when you enter into this ecstatic state. This poet describes it as opening a door that floats in the sky \u2014 a very similar description to what Albert Einstein gave as to how he imagined the forces of relativity, when he was struggling with trying to understand how it worked. But it happens in other activities. For instance, this is another student of mine, Susan Jackson from Australia, who did work with some of the leading athletes in the world. And you see here in this description of an Olympic skater, the same essential description of the phenomenology of the inner state of the person. You don't think; it goes automatically, if you merge yourself with the music, and so forth.It happens also, actually, in the most recent book I wrote, called \"Good Business,\" where I interviewed some of the CEOs who had been nominated by their peers as being both very successful and very ethical, very socially responsible. You see that these people define success as something that helps others and at the same time makes you feel happy as you are working at it. And like all of these successful and responsible CEOs say, you can't have just one of these things be successful if you want a meaningful and successful job. Anita Roddick is another one of these CEOs we interviewed. She is the founder of Body Shop, the natural cosmetics king. It's kind of a passion that comes from doing the best and having flow while you're working.This is an interesting little quote from Masaru Ibuka, who was at that time starting out Sony without any money, without a product \u2014 they didn't have a product, they didn't have anything, but they had an idea. And the idea he had was to establish a place of work where engineers can feel the joy of technological innovation, be aware of their mission to society and work to their heart's content. I couldn't improve on this as a good example of how flow enters the workplace.Now, when we do studies \u2014 we have, with other colleagues around the world, done over 8,000 interviews of people \u2014 from Dominican monks, to blind nuns, to Himalayan climbers, to Navajo shepherds \u2014 who enjoy their work. And regardless of the culture, regardless of education or whatever, there are these seven conditions that seem to be there when a person is in flow. There's this focus that, once it becomes intense, leads to a sense of ecstasy, a sense of clarity: you know exactly what you want to do from one moment to the other; you get immediate feedback. You know that what you need to do is possible to do, even though difficult, and sense of time disappears, you forget yourself, you feel part of something larger. And once the conditions are present, what you are doing becomes worth doing for its own sake.In our studies, we represent the everyday life of people in this simple scheme. And we can measure this very precisely, actually, because we give people electronic pagers that go off 10 times a day, and whenever they go off you say what you're doing, how you feel, where you are, what you're thinking about. And two things that we measure is the amount of challenge people experience at that moment and the amount of skill that they feel they have at that moment. So for each person we can establish an average, which is the center of the diagram. That would be your mean level of challenge and skill, which will be different from that of anybody else. But you have a kind of a set point there, which would be in the middle.If we know what that set point is, we can predict fairly accurately when you will be in flow, and it will be when your challenges are higher than average and skills are higher than average. And you may be doing things very differently from other people, but for everyone that flow channel, that area there, will be when you are doing what you really like to do \u2014 play the piano, be with your best friend, perhaps work, if work is what provides flow for you. And then the other areas become less and less positive.Arousal is still good because you are over-challenged there. Your skills are not quite as high as they should be, but you can move into flow fairly easily by just developing a little more skill. So, arousal is the area where most people learn from, because that's where they're pushed beyond their comfort zone and to enter that \u2014 going back to flow \u2014 then they develop higher skills. Control is also a good place to be, because there you feel comfortable, but not very excited. It's not very challenging any more. And if you want to enter flow from control, you have to increase the challenges. So those two are ideal and complementary areas from which flow is easy to go into.The other combinations of challenge and skill become progressively less optimal. Relaxation is fine \u2014 you still feel OK. Boredom begins to be very aversive and apathy becomes very negative: you don't feel that you're doing anything, you don't use your skills, there's no challenge. Unfortunately, a lot of people's experience is in apathy. The largest single contributor to that experience is watching television; the next one is being in the bathroom, sitting. Even though sometimes watching television about seven to eight percent of the time is in flow, but that's when you choose a program you really want to watch and you get feedback from it.So the question we are trying to address \u2014 and I'm way over time \u2014 is how to put more and more of everyday life in that flow channel. And that is the kind of challenge that we're trying to understand. And some of you obviously know how to do that spontaneously without any advice, but unfortunately a lot of people don't. And that's what our mandate is, in a way, to do.Thank you.(Applause)", "id": 366, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:11.958 --> 00:00:16.958\nI grew up in Europe, and World War II caught me\n\n00:00:16.958 --> 00:00:20.958\nwhen I was between seven and 10 years old.\n\n00:00:20.958 --> 00:00:27.958\nAnd I realized how few of the grown-ups that I knew\n\n00:00:27.958 --> 00:00:37.958\nwere able to withstand the tragedies that the war visited on them --\n\n00:00:37.958 --> 00:00:45.958\nhow few of them could even resemble a normal, contented,\n\n00:00:45.958 --> 00:00:54.958\nsatisfied, happy life once their job, their home, their security\n\n00:00:54.958 --> 00:00:56.958\nwas destroyed by the war.\n\n00:00:56.958 --> 00:00:59.958\nSo I became interested in understanding\n\n00:00:59.958 --> 00:01:04.958\nwhat contributed to a life that was worth living.\n\n00:01:04.958 --> 00:01:10.958\nAnd I tried, as a child, as a teenager, to read philosophy\n\n00:01:10.958 --> 00:01:18.958\nand to get involved in art and religion and many other ways\n\n00:01:18.958 --> 00:01:22.958\nthat I could see as a possible answer to that question.\n\n00:01:22.958 --> 00:01:31.958\nAnd finally I ended up encountering psychology by chance.\n\n00:01:31.958 --> 00:01:36.958\nI was at a ski resort in Switzerland without any money\n\n00:01:36.958 --> 00:01:44.958\nto actually enjoy myself, because the snow had melted and\n\n00:01:44.958 --> 00:01:49.958\nI didn't have money to go to a movie.

00:06:48.958\nWe know the temples they built, where people could come\n\n00:06:48.958 --> 00:06:50.958\nto experience a different reality.\n\n00:06:50.958 --> 00:06:53.958\nWe know about the circuses,\n\n00:06:53.958 --> 00:06:56.958\nthe arenas, the theaters.\n\n00:06:56.958 --> 00:07:04.958\nThese are the remains of civilizations and they are the places that people went\n\n00:07:04.958 --> 00:07:13.958\nto experience life in a more concentrated, more ordered form.\n\n00:07:13.958 --> 00:07:17.958\nNow, this man doesn't need to go to a place like this,\n\n00:07:17.958 --> 00:07:21.958\nwhich is also -- this place, this arena, which is built\n\n00:07:21.958 --> 00:07:25.958\nlike a Greek amphitheatre, is a place for ecstasy also.\n\n00:07:25.958 --> 00:07:29.958\nWe are participating in a reality that is different\n\n00:07:29.958 --> 00:07:32.958\nfrom that of the everyday life that we're used to.\n\n00:07:32.958 --> 00:07:35.958\nBut this man doesn't need to go there.\n\n00:07:35.958 --> 00:07:41.958\nHe needs just a piece of paper where he can put down little marks,\n\n00:07:41.958 --> 00:07:47.958\nand as he does that, he can imagine sounds\n\n00:07:47.958 --> 00:07:51.958\nthat had not existed before in that particular combination.\n\n00:07:51.958 --> 00:07:57.958\nSo once he gets to that point of beginning to create,\n\n00:07:57.958 --> 00:08:00.958\nlike Jennifer did in her improvisation,\n\n00:08:00.958 --> 00:08:05.958\na new reality -- that is, a moment of ecstasy --\n\n00:08:05.958 --> 00:08:08.958\nhe enters that different reality.\n\n00:08:08.958 --> 00:08:12.958\nNow he says also that this is so intense an experience\n\n00:08:12.958 --> 00:08:15.958\nthat it feels almost as if he didn't exist.\n\n00:08:15.958 --> 00:08:21.958\nAnd that sounds like a kind of a romantic exaggeration.\n\n00:08:21.958 --> 00:08:25.958\nBut actually, our nervous system is incapable of processing\n\n00:08:25.958 --> 00:08:30.958\nmore than about 110 bits of information per second.\n\n00:08:30.958 --> 00:08:34.958\nAnd in order to hear me and understand what I'm saying,\n\n00:08:34.958 --> 00:08:38.958\nyou need to process about 60 bits per second.\n\n00:08:38.958 --> 00:08:41.958\nThat's why you can't hear more than two people.\n\n00:08:41.958 --> 00:08:44.958\nYou can't understand more than two people talking to you.\n\n00:08:44.958 --> 00:08:55.958\nWell, when you are really involved in this completely engaging process\n\n00:08:55.958 --> 00:08:58.958\nof creating something new, as this man is,\n\n00:08:58.958 --> 00:09:04.958\nhe doesn't have enough attention left over to monitor\n\n00:09:04.958 --> 00:09:08.958\nhow his body feels, or his problems at home.\n\n00:09:08.958 --> 00:09:11.958\nHe can't feel even that he's hungry or tired.\n\n00:09:11.958 --> 00:09:14.958\nHis body disappears,\n\n00:09:14.958 --> 00:09:19.958\nhis identity disappears from his consciousness,\n\n00:09:19.958 --> 00:09:23.958\nbecause he doesn't have enough attention, like none of us do,\n\n00:09:23.958 --> 00:09:29.958\nto really do well something that requires a lot of concentration,\n\n00:09:29.958 --> 00:09:31.958\nand at the same time to feel that he exists.\n\n00:09:31.958 --> 00:09:35.958\nSo existence is temporarily suspended.\n\n00:09:36.958 --> 00:09:41.958\nAnd he says that his hand seems to be moving by itself.\n\n00:09:42.958 --> 00:09:50.958\nNow, I could look at my hand for two weeks, and I wouldn't feel\n\n00:09:50.958 --> 00:09:54.958\nany awe or wonder, because I can't compose. (Laughter)\n\n00:09:54.958 --> 00:09:56.958\nSo what it's telling you here\n\n00:09:56.958 --> 00:10:03.958\nis that obviously this automatic,\n\n00:10:03.958 --> 00:10:08.958\nspontaneous process that he's describing can only happen to someone\n\n00:10:08.958 --> 00:10:12.958\nwho is very well trained and who has developed technique.\n\n00:10:12.958 --> 00:10:19.958\nAnd it has become a kind of a truism in the study of creativity\n\n00:10:19.958 --> 00:10:24.958\nthat you can't be creating anything with less than 10 years\n\n00:10:24.958 --> 00:10:30.958\nof technical-knowledge immersion in a particular field.\n\n00:10:30.958 --> 00:10:35.958\nWhether it's mathematics or music, it takes that long\n\n00:10:35.958 --> 00:10:43.958\nto be able to begin to change something in a way that it's better\n\n00:10:43.958 --> 00:10:46.958\nthan what was there before.\n\n00:10:46.958 --> 00:10:48.958\nNow, when that happens,\n\n00:10:48.958 --> 00:10:50.958\nhe says the music just flows out.\n\n00:10:50.958 --> 00:10:54.958\nAnd because all of these people I started interviewing --\n\n00:10:54.958 --> 00:10:58.958\nthis was an interview which is over 30 years old --\n\n00:11:00.958 --> 00:11:04.958\nso many of the people described this as a spontaneous flow\n\n00:11:04.958 --> 00:11:09.958\nthat I called this type of experience the \"flow experience.\"\n\n00:11:09.958 --> 00:11:12.958\nAnd it happens in different realms.\n\n00:11:12.958 --> 00:11:16.958\nFor instance, a poet describes it in this form.\n\n00:11:16.958 --> 00:11:19.958\nThis is by a student of mine who interviewed\n\n00:11:19.958 --> 00:11:22.958\nsome of the leading writers and poets in the United States.\n\n00:11:22.958 --> 00:11:28.958\nAnd it describes the same effortless, spontaneous feeling\n\n00:11:28.958 --> 00:11:31.958\nthat you get when you enter into this ecstatic state.\n\n00:11:31.958 --> 00:11:36.958\nThis poet describes it as opening a door that floats in the sky --\n\n00:11:36.958 --> 00:11:39.958\na very similar description to what Albert Einstein gave\n\n00:11:39.958 --> 00:11:45.958\nas to how he imagined the forces of relativity,\n\n00:11:45.958 --> 00:11:49.958\nwhen he was struggling with trying to understand how it worked.\n\n00:11:49.958 --> 00:11:54.958\nBut it happens in other activities.\n\n00:11:54.958 --> 00:11:56.958\nFor instance, this is another student of mine,\n\n00:11:56.958 --> 00:12:00.958\nSusan Jackson from Australia, who did work\n\n00:12:00.958 --> 00:12:04.958\nwith some of the leading athletes in the world.\n\n00:12:04.958 --> 00:12:08.958\nAnd you see here in this description of an Olympic skater,\n\n00:12:08.958 --> 00:12:11.958\nthe same essential description of the phenomenology\n\n00:12:11.958 --> 00:12:13.958\nof the inner state of the person.\n\n00:12:13.958 --> 00:12:16.958\nYou don't think; it goes automatically,\n\n00:12:16.958 --> 00:12:20.958\nif you merge yourself with the music, and so forth.\n\n00:12:20.958 --> 00:12:24.958\nIt happens also, actually, in the most recent book I wrote,\n\n00:12:24.958 --> 00:12:27.958\ncalled \"Good Business,\" where I interviewed some of the CEOs\n\n00:12:27.958 --> 00:12:32.958\nwho had been nominated by their peers as being both very successful\n\n00:12:32.958 --> 00:12:35.958\nand very ethical, very socially responsible.\n\n00:12:35.958 --> 00:12:39.958\nYou see that these people define success\n\n00:12:39.958 --> 00:12:44.958\nas something that helps others and at the same time\n\n00:12:44.958 --> 00:12:47.958\nmakes you feel happy as you are working at it.\n\n00:12:47.958 --> 00:12:53.958\nAnd like all of these successful and responsible CEOs say,\n\n00:12:54.958 --> 00:12:59.958\nyou can't have just one of these things be successful\n\n00:13:01.958 --> 00:13:04.958\nif you want a meaningful and successful job.\n\n00:13:04.958 --> 00:13:09.958\nAnita Roddick is another one of these CEOs we interviewed.\n\n00:13:09.958 --> 00:13:13.958\nShe is the founder of Body Shop,\n\n00:13:13.958 --> 00:13:15.958\nthe natural cosmetics king.\n\n00:13:15.958 --> 00:13:17.958\nIt's kind of a passion that comes\n\n00:13:17.958 --> 00:13:21.958\nfrom doing the best and having flow while you're working.\n\n00:13:21.958 --> 00:13:25.958\nThis is an interesting little quote from Masaru Ibuka,\n\n00:13:25.958 --> 00:13:30.958\nwho was at that time starting out Sony without any money,\n\n00:13:30.958 --> 00:13:32.958\nwithout a product -- they didn't have a product,\n\n00:13:32.958 --> 00:13:35.958\nthey didn't have anything, but they had an idea.\n\n00:13:35.958 --> 00:13:40.958\nAnd the idea he had was to establish a place of work where engineers\n\n00:13:40.958 --> 00:13:44.958\ncan feel the joy of technological innovation,\n\n00:13:44.958 --> 00:13:49.958\nbe aware of their mission to society and work to their heart's content.\n\n00:13:49.958 --> 00:13:53.958\nI couldn't improve on this as a good example\n\n00:13:53.958 --> 00:13:56.958\nof how flow enters the workplace.\n\n00:13:56.958 --> 00:13:59.958\nNow, when we do studies --\n\n00:13:59.958 --> 00:14:03.958\nwe have, with other colleagues around the world,\n\n00:14:03.958 --> 00:14:08.958\ndone over 8,000 interviews of people -- from Dominican monks,\n\n00:14:08.958 --> 00:14:15.958\nto blind nuns, to Himalayan climbers, to Navajo shepherds --\n\n00:14:15.958 --> 00:14:17.958\nwho enjoy their work.\n\n00:14:17.958 --> 00:14:19.958\nAnd regardless of the culture,\n\n00:14:19.958 --> 00:14:26.958\nregardless of education or whatever, there are these seven conditions\n\n00:14:26.958 --> 00:14:30.958\nthat seem to be there when a person is in flow.\n\n00:14:30.958 --> 00:14:34.958\nThere's this focus that, once it becomes intense,\n\n00:14:34.958 --> 00:14:38.958\nleads to a sense of ecstasy, a sense of clarity:\n\n00:14:38.958 --> 00:14:41.958\nyou know exactly what you want to do from one moment to the other;\n\n00:14:41.958 --> 00:14:43.958\nyou get immediate feedback.\n\n00:14:43.958 --> 00:14:45.958\nYou know that what you need to do\n\n00:14:45.958 --> 00:14:48.958\nis possible to do, even though difficult,\n\n00:14:48.958 --> 00:14:51.958\nand sense of time disappears, you forget yourself,\n\n00:14:51.958 --> 00:14:54.958\nyou feel part of something larger.\n\n00:14:54.958 --> 00:14:57.958\nAnd once the conditions are present,\n\n00:14:57.958 --> 00:15:02.958\nwhat you are doing becomes worth doing for its own sake.\n\n00:15:02.958 --> 00:15:08.958\nIn our studies, we represent the everyday life of people in this simple scheme.\n\n00:15:08.958 --> 00:15:12.958\nAnd we can measure this very precisely, actually,\n\n00:15:12.958 --> 00:15:16.958\nbecause we give people electronic pagers that go off 10 times a day,\n\n00:15:16.958 --> 00:15:21.958\nand whenever they go off you say what you're doing, how you feel,\n\n00:15:21.958 --> 00:15:23.958\nwhere you are, what you're thinking about.\n\n00:15:23.958 --> 00:15:26.958\nAnd two things that we measure is the amount of challenge\n\n00:15:26.958 --> 00:15:30.958\npeople experience at that moment and the amount of skill\n\n00:15:30.958 --> 00:15:33.958\nthat they feel they have at that moment.\n\n00:15:33.958 --> 00:15:36.958\nSo for each person we can establish an average,\n\n00:15:36.958 --> 00:15:39.958\nwhich is the center of the diagram.\n\n00:15:39.958 --> 00:15:42.958\nThat would be your mean level of challenge and skill,\n\n00:15:42.958 --> 00:15:45.958\nwhich will be different from that of anybody else.\n\n00:15:45.958 --> 00:15:50.958\nBut you have a kind of a set point there, which would be in the middle.\n\n00:15:50.958 --> 00:15:52.958\nIf we know what that set point is,\n\n00:15:52.958 --> 00:15:57.958\nwe can predict fairly accurately when you will be in flow,\n\n00:15:57.958 --> 00:16:00.958\nand it will be when your challenges are higher than average\n\n00:16:00.958 --> 00:16:02.958\nand skills are higher than average.\n\n00:16:02.958 --> 00:16:06.958\nAnd you may be doing things very differently from other people,\n\n00:16:06.958 --> 00:16:10.958\nbut for everyone that flow channel, that area there,\n\n00:16:10.958 --> 00:16:14.958\nwill be when you are doing what you really like to do --\n\n00:16:14.958 --> 00:16:20.958\nplay the piano, be with your best friend, perhaps work,\n\n00:16:20.958 --> 00:16:24.958\nif work is what provides flow for you.\n\n00:16:24.958 --> 00:16:28.958\nAnd then the other areas become less and less positive.\n\n00:16:28.958 --> 00:16:33.958\nArousal is still good because you are over-challenged there.\n\n00:16:33.958 --> 00:16:35.958\nYour skills are not quite as high as they should be,\n\n00:16:35.958 --> 00:16:38.958\nbut you can move into flow fairly easily\n\n00:16:38.958 --> 00:16:41.958\nby just developing a little more skill.\n\n00:16:41.958 --> 00:16:45.958\nSo, arousal is the area where most people learn from,\n\n00:16:45.958 --> 00:16:51.958\nbecause that's where they're pushed beyond their comfort zone\n\n00:16:51.958 --> 00:16:54.958\nand to enter that -- going back to flow --\n\n00:16:54.958 --> 00:16:56.958\nthen they develop higher skills.\n\n00:16:56.958 --> 00:17:00.958\nControl is also a good place to be,\n\n00:17:00.958 --> 00:17:04.958\nbecause there you feel comfortable, but not very excited.\n\n00:17:04.958 --> 00:17:07.958\nIt's not very challenging any more.\n\n00:17:07.958 --> 00:17:09.958\nAnd if you want to enter flow from control,\n\n00:17:09.958 --> 00:17:12.958\nyou have to increase the challenges.\n\n00:17:12.958 --> 00:17:16.958\nSo those two are ideal and complementary areas\n\n00:17:16.958 --> 00:17:20.958\nfrom which flow is easy to go into.\n\n00:17:20.958 --> 00:17:23.958\nThe other combinations of challenge and skill\n\n00:17:23.958 --> 00:17:26.958\nbecome progressively less optimal.\n\n00:17:26.958 --> 00:17:28.958\nRelaxation is fine -- you still feel OK.\n\n00:17:28.958 --> 00:17:33.958\nBoredom begins to be very aversive\n\n00:17:33.958 --> 00:17:37.958\nand apathy becomes very negative:\n\n00:17:37.958 --> 00:17:41.958\nyou don't feel that you're doing anything,\n\n00:17:41.958 --> 00:17:43.958\nyou don't use your skills, there's no challenge.\n\n00:17:43.958 --> 00:17:48.958\nUnfortunately, a lot of people's experience is in apathy.\n\n00:17:48.958 --> 00:17:55.958\nThe largest single contributor to that experience\n\n00:17:55.958 --> 00:18:01.958\nis watching television; the next one is being in the bathroom, sitting.\n\n00:18:01.958 --> 00:18:07.958\nEven though sometimes watching television\n\n00:18:07.958 --> 00:18:11.958\nabout seven to eight percent of the time is in flow,\n\n00:18:11.958 --> 00:18:14.958\nbut that's when you choose a program you really want to watch\n\n00:18:14.958 --> 00:18:17.958\nand you get feedback from it.\n\n00:18:17.958 --> 00:18:23.958\nSo the question we are trying to address -- and I'm way over time --\n\n00:18:23.958 --> 00:18:29.958\nis how to put more and more of everyday life in that flow channel.\n\n00:18:29.958 --> 00:18:34.958\nAnd that is the kind of challenge that we're trying to understand.\n\n00:18:34.958 --> 00:18:37.958\nAnd some of you obviously know how to do that spontaneously\n\n00:18:37.958 --> 00:18:41.958\nwithout any advice, but unfortunately a lot of people don't.\n\n00:18:41.958 --> 00:18:47.958\nAnd that's what our mandate is, in a way, to do.\n\n00:18:47.958 --> 00:18:48.958\nThank you.\n\n00:18:48.958 --> 00:18:49.958\n(Applause)"}, {"title": "The face of AIDS in Africa",

35 percent of the population is HIV positive. It really wasn't until I was invited to the homes of people that I started to understand the human toll of the epidemic. For instance, this is Herbert with his grandmother. When I first met him, he was sitting on his grandmother's lap. He has been orphaned, as both of his parents died of AIDS, and his grandmother took care of him until he too died of AIDS. He liked to sit on her lap because he said that it was painful for him to lie in his own bed. When she got up to make tea, she placed him in my own lap and I had never felt a child that was that emaciated. Before I left, I actually asked him if I could get him something. I thought he would ask for a toy, or candy, and he asked me for slippers, because he said that his feet were cold.This is Joyce who's \u2014 in this picture \u2014 21. Single mother, HIV positive. I photographed her before and after the birth of her beautiful baby girl, Issa. And I was last week walking on Lafayette Street in Manhattan and got a call from a woman who I didn't know, but she called to tell me that Joyce had passed away at the age of 23. Joyce's mother is now taking care of her daughter, like so many other Zimbabwean children who've been orphaned by the epidemic. So a few of the stories. With every picture, there are individuals who have full lives and stories that deserve to be told. All these pictures are from Zimbabwe.Chris Anderson: Kirsten, will you just take one minute, just to tell your own story of how you got to Africa?Kirsten Ashburn: Mmm, gosh.CA: Just \u2014KA: Actually, I was working at the time, doing production for a fashion photographer. And I was constantly reading the New York Times, and stunned by the statistics, the numbers. It was just frightening. So I quit my job and decided that that's the subject that I wanted to tackle. And I first actually went to Botswana, where I spent a month \u2014 this is in December 2000 \u2014 then went to Zimbabwe for a month and a half, and then went back again this March 2002 for another month and a half in Zimbabwe.CA: That's an amazing story, thank you.KB: Thanks for letting me show these.", "id": 381, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:11.958 --> 00:00:14.958\nWhen I first arrived in beautiful Zimbabwe,\n\n00:00:14.958 --> 00:00:19.958\nit was difficult to understand that 35 percent of the population\n\n00:00:19.958 --> 00:00:21.958\nis HIV positive.\n\n00:00:22.958 --> 00:00:26.958\nIt really wasn't until I was invited to the homes of people\n\n00:00:26.958 --> 00:00:31.958\nthat I started to understand the human toll of the epidemic.\n\n00:00:31.958 --> 00:00:35.958\nFor instance, this is Herbert with his grandmother.\n\n00:00:35.958 --> 00:00:39.958\nWhen I first met him, he was sitting on his grandmother's lap.\n\n00:00:39.958 --> 00:00:42.958\nHe has been orphaned, as both of his parents died of AIDS,\n\n00:00:42.958 --> 00:00:46.958\nand his grandmother took care of him until he too died of AIDS.\n\n00:00:46.958 --> 00:00:48.958\nHe liked to sit on her lap\n\n00:00:48.958 --> 00:00:53.958\nbecause he said that it was painful for him to lie in his own bed.\n\n00:00:53.958 --> 00:00:57.958\nWhen she got up to make tea, she placed him in my own lap\n\n00:00:57.958 --> 00:01:03.958\nand I had never felt a child that was that emaciated.\n\n00:01:04.958 --> 00:01:08.958\nBefore I left, I actually asked him if I could get him something.\n\n00:01:08.958 --> 00:01:10.958\nI thought he would ask for a toy, or candy,\n\n00:01:10.958 --> 00:01:13.958\nand he asked me for slippers,\n\n00:01:13.958 --> 00:01:16.958\nbecause he said that his feet were cold.\n\n00:01:16.958 --> 00:01:19.958\nThis is Joyce who's -- in this picture -- 21.\n\n00:01:19.958 --> 00:01:22.958\nSingle mother, HIV positive.\n\n00:01:22.958 --> 00:01:24.958\nI photographed her before and after\n\n00:01:24.958 --> 00:01:27.958\nthe birth of her beautiful baby girl, Issa.\n\n00:01:27.958 --> 00:01:30.958\nAnd I was last week walking on Lafayette Street in Manhattan\n\n00:01:30.958 --> 00:01:33.958\nand got a call from a woman who I didn't know,\n\n00:01:33.958 --> 00:01:36.958\nbut she called to tell me that Joyce had passed away\n\n00:01:36.958 --> 00:01:38.958\nat the age of 23.\n\n00:01:38.958 --> 00:01:41.958\nJoyce's mother is now taking care of her daughter,\n\n00:01:41.958 --> 00:01:43.958\nlike so many other Zimbabwean children\n\n00:01:43.958 --> 00:01:45.958\nwho've been orphaned by the epidemic.\n\n00:01:45.958 --> 00:01:47.958\nSo a few of the stories.\n\n00:01:47.958 --> 00:01:49.958\nWith every picture,\n\n00:01:49.958 --> 00:01:54.958\nthere are individuals who have full lives\n\n00:01:54.958 --> 00:01:56.958\nand stories that deserve to be told.\n\n00:01:56.958 --> 00:01:59.958\nAll these pictures are from Zimbabwe.\n\n00:03:41.958 --> 00:03:43.958\nChris Anderson: Kirsten, will you just take one minute,\n\n00:03:43.958 --> 00:03:48.958\njust to tell your own story of how you got to Africa?\n\n00:03:48.958 --> 00:03:49.958\nKirsten Ashburn: Mmm, gosh.\n\n00:03:49.958 --> 00:03:50.958\nCA: Just --\n\n00:03:50.958 --> 00:03:54.958\nKA: Actually, I was working at the time, doing production\n\n00:03:54.958 --> 00:03:56.958\nfor a fashion photographer.\n\n00:03:56.958 --> 00:03:59.958\nAnd I was constantly reading the New York Times,\n\n00:03:59.958 --> 00:04:03.958\nand stunned by the statistics, the numbers.\n\n00:04:03.958 --> 00:04:05.958\nIt was just frightening.\n\n00:04:05.958 --> 00:04:07.958\nSo I quit my job\n\n00:04:07.958 --> 00:04:10.958\nand decided that that's the subject that I wanted to tackle.\n\n00:04:11.958 --> 00:04:15.958\nAnd I first actually went to Botswana, where I spent a month --\n\n00:04:15.958 --> 00:04:17.958\nthis is in December 2000 --\n\n00:04:17.958 --> 00:04:20.958\nthen went to Zimbabwe for a month and a half,\n\n00:04:20.958 --> 00:04:23.958\nand then went back again this March 2002\n\n00:04:23.958 --> 00:04:26.958\nfor another month and a half in Zimbabwe.\n\n00:04:26.958 --> 00:04:28.958\nCA: That's an amazing story, thank you.\n\n00:04:28.958 --> 00:04:30.958\nKB: Thanks for letting me show these."}, {"title": "Why do societies collapse?", "duration": "1101", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/jared_diamond_on_why_societies_collapse", "transcript": "I think all of us have been interested, at one time or another, in the romantic mysteries of all those societies that collapsed, such as the classic Maya in the Yucatan, the Easter Islanders, the Anasazi, Fertile Crescent society, Angor Wat, Great Zimbabwe and so on. And within the last decade or two, archaeologists have shown us that there were environmental problems underlying many of these past collapses. But there were also plenty of places in the world where societies have been developing for thousands of years without any sign of a major collapse, such as Japan, Java, Tonga and Tikopea. So evidently, societies in some areas are more fragile than in other areas. How can we understand what makes some societies more fragile than other societies? The problem is obviously relevant to our situation today, because today as well, there are some societies that have already collapsed, such as Somalia and Rwanda and the former Yugoslavia. There are also societies today that may be close to collapse, such as Nepal, Indonesia and Columbia.What about ourselves? What is there that we can learn from the past that would help us avoid declining or collapsing in the way that so many past societies have? Obviously the answer to this question is not going to be a single factor. If anyone tells you that there is a single-factor explanation for societal collapses, you know right away that they're an idiot. This is a complex subject. But how can we make sense out of the complexities of this subject? In analyzing societal collapses, I've arrived at a five-point framework \u2014 a checklist of things that I go through to try and understand collapses. And I'll illustrate that five-point framework by the extinction of the Greenland Norse society. This is a European society with literate records, so we know a good deal about the people and their motivation. In AD 984 Vikings went out to Greenland, settled Greenland, and around 1450 they died out \u2014 the society collapsed, and every one of them ended up dead.Why did they all end up dead? Well, in my five-point framework, the first item on the framework is to look for human impacts on the environment: people inadvertently destroying the resource base on which they depend. And in the case of the Viking Norse, the Vikings inadvertently caused soil erosion and deforestation, which was a particular problem for them because they required forests to make charcoal, to make iron. So they ended up an Iron Age European society, virtually unable to make their own iron. A second item on my checklist is climate change. Climate can get warmer or colder or dryer or wetter. In the case of the Vikings \u2014 in Greenland, the climate got colder in the late 1300s, and especially in the 1400s. But a cold climate isn't necessarily fatal, because the Inuit \u2014 the Eskimos inhabiting Greenland at the same time \u2014 did better, rather than worse, with cold climates. So why didn't the Greenland Norse as well?The third thing on my checklist is relations with neighboring friendly societies that may prop up a society. And if that friendly support is pulled away, that may make a society more likely to collapse. In the case of the Greenland Norse, they had trade with the mother country \u2014 Norway \u2014 and that trade dwindled: partly because Norway got weaker, partly because of sea ice between Greenland and Norway.The fourth item on my checklist is relations with hostile societies. In the case of Norse Greenland, the hostiles were the Inuit \u2014 the Eskimos sharing Greenland \u2014 with whom the Norse got off to bad relationships. And we know that the Inuit killed the Norse and, probably of greater importance, may have blocked access to the outer fjords, on which the Norse depended for seals at a critical time of the year.And then finally, the fifth item on my checklist is the political, economic, social and cultural factors in the society that make it more or less likely that the society will perceive and solve its environmental problems. In the case of the Greenland Norse, cultural factors that made it difficult for them to solve their problems were: their commitments to a Christian society investing heavily in cathedrals; their being a competitive-ranked chiefly society; and their scorn for the Inuit, from whom they refused to learn. So that's how the five-part framework is relevant to the collapse and eventual extinction of the Greenland Norse.What about a society today? For the past five years, I've been taking my wife and kids to Southwestern Montana, where I worked as a teenager on the hay harvest. And Montana, at first sight, seems like the most pristine environment in the United States. But scratch the surface, and Montana suffers from serious problems. Going through the same checklist: human environmental impacts? Yes, acute in Montana. Toxic problems from mine waste have caused damage of billions of dollars. Problems from weeds, weed control, cost Montana nearly 200 million dollars a year. Montana has lost agricultural areas from salinization, problems of forest management, problems of forest fires. Second item on my checklist: climate change. Yes \u2014 the climate in Montana is getting warmer and drier, but Montana agriculture depends especially on irrigation from the snow pack, and as the snow is melting \u2014 for example, as the glaciers in Glacier National Park are disappearing \u2014 that's bad news for Montana irrigation agriculture.Third thing on my checklist: relations with friendlies that can sustain the society. In Montana today, more than half of the income of Montana is not earned within Montana, but is derived from out of state: transfer payments from social security, investments and so on \u2014 which makes Montana vulnerable to the rest of the United States.Fourth: relations with hostiles. Montanans have the same problems as do all Americans, in being sensitive to problems created by hostiles overseas affecting our oil supplies, and terrorist attacks. And finally, last item on my checklist: question of how political, economic, social, cultural attitudes play into this. Montanans have long-held values, which today seem to be getting in the way of their solving their own problems. Long-held devotion to logging and to mines and to agriculture, and to no government regulation; values that worked well in the past, but they don't seem to be working well today.So, I'm looking at these issues of collapses for a lot of past societies and for many present societies. Are there any general conclusions that arise? In a way, just like Tolstoy's statement about every unhappy marriage being different, every collapsed or endangered society is different \u2014 they all have different details. But nevertheless, there are certain common threads that emerge from these comparisons of past societies that did or did not collapse and threatened societies today. One interesting common thread has to do with, in many cases, the rapidity of collapse after a society reaches its peak. There are many societies that don't wind down gradually, but they build up \u2014 get richer and more powerful \u2014 and then within a short time, within a few decades after their peak, they collapse. For example, the classic lowland Maya of the Yucatan began to collapse in the early 800s \u2014 literally a few decades after the Maya were building their biggest monuments, and Maya population was greatest.Or again, the collapse of the Soviet Union took place within a couple of decades, maybe within a decade, of the time when the Soviet Union was at its greatest power. An analogue would be the growth of bacteria in a petri dish. These rapid collapses are especially likely where there's a mismatch between available resources and resource consumption, or a mismatch between economic outlays and economic potential. In a petri dish, bacteria grow. Say they double every generation, and five generations before the end the petri dish is 15/16ths empty, and then the next generation's 3/4ths empty, and the next generation half empty. Within one generation after the petri dish still being half empty, it is full. There's no more food and the bacteria have collapsed. So, this is a frequent theme: societies collapse very soon after reaching their peak in power.What it means to put it mathematically is that, if you're concerned about a society today, you should be looking not at the value of the mathematical function \u2014 the wealth itself \u2014 but you should be looking at the first derivative and the second derivatives of the function. That's one general theme. A second general theme is that there are many, often subtle environmental factors that make some societies more fragile than others. Many of those factors are not well understood. For example, why is it that in the Pacific, of those hundreds of Pacific islands, why did Easter Island end up as the most devastating case of complete deforestation? It turns out that there were about nine different environmental factors \u2014 some, rather subtle ones \u2014 that were working against the Easter Islanders, and they involve fallout of volcanic tephra, latitude, rainfall. Perhaps the most subtle of them is that it turns out that a major input of nutrients which protects island environments in the Pacific is from the fallout of continental dust from central Asia. Easter, of all Pacific islands, has the least input of dust from Asia restoring the fertility of its soils. But that's a factor that we didn't even appreciate until 1999.So, some societies, for subtle environmental reasons, are more fragile than others. And then finally, another generalization. I'm now teaching a course at UCLA, to UCLA undergraduates, on these collapses of societies. What really bugs my UCLA undergraduate students is, how on earth did these societies not see what they were doing? How could the Easter Islanders have deforested their environment? What did they say when they were cutting down the last palm tree? Didn't they see what they were doing? How could societies not perceive their impacts on the environments and stop in time? And I would expect that, if our human civilization carries on, then maybe in the next century people will be asking, why on earth did these people today in the year 2003 not see the obvious things that they were doing and take corrective action? It seems incredible in the past. In the future, it'll seem incredible what we are doing today. And so I've been trying to develop a hierarchical set of considerations about why societies fail to solve their problems \u2014 why they fail to perceive the problems or, if they perceive them, why they fail to tackle them. Or, if they tackle them, why do they fail to succeed in solving them?I'll just mention two generalizations in this area. One blueprint for trouble, making collapse likely, is where there is a conflict of interest between the short-term interest of the decision-making elites and the long-term interest of the society as a whole, especially if the elites are able to insulate themselves from the consequences of their actions. Where what's good in the short run for the elite is bad for the society as a whole, there's a real risk of the elite doing things that would bring the society down in the long run. For example, among the Greenland Norse \u2014 a competitive rank society \u2014 what the chiefs really wanted is more followers and more sheep and more resources to outcompete the neighboring chiefs. And that led the chiefs to do what's called flogging the land: overstocking the land, forcing tenant farmers into dependency. And that made the chiefs powerful in the short run, but led to the society's collapse in the long run.Those same issues of conflicts of interest are acute in the United States today. Especially because the decision makers in the United States are frequently able to insulate themselves from consequences by living in gated compounds, by drinking bottled water and so on. And within the last couple of years, it's been obvious that the elite in the business world correctly perceive that they can advance their short-term interest by doing things that are good for them but bad for society as a whole, such as draining a few billion dollars out of Enron and other businesses. They are quite correct that these things are good for them in the short term, although bad for society in the long term. So, that's one general conclusion about why societies make bad decisions: conflicts of interest.And the other generalization that I want to mention is that it's particularly hard for a society to make quote-unquote good decisions when there is a conflict involving strongly held values that are good in many circumstances but are poor in other circumstances. For example, the Greenland Norse, in this difficult environment, were held together for four-and-a-half centuries by their shared commitment to religion, and by their strong social cohesion. But those two things \u2014 commitment to religion and strong social cohesion \u2014 also made it difficult for them to change at the end and to learn from the Inuit. Or today \u2014 Australia. One of the things that enabled Australia to survive in this remote outpost of European civilization for 250 years has been their British identity. But today, their commitment to a British identity is serving Australians poorly in their need to adapt to their situation in Asia. So it's particularly difficult to change course when the things that get you in trouble are the things that are also the source of your strength.What's going to be the outcome today? Well, all of us know the dozen sorts of ticking time bombs going on in the modern world, time bombs that have fuses of a few decades to \u2014 all of them, not more than 50 years, and any one of which can do us in; the time bombs of water, of soil, of climate change, invasive species, the photosynthetic ceiling, population problems, toxics, etc., etc. \u2014 listing about 12 of them. And while these time bombs \u2014 none of them has a fuse beyond 50 years, and most of them have fuses of a few decades \u2014 some of them, in some places, have much shorter fuses. At the rate at which we're going now, the Philippines will lose all its accessible loggable forest within five years. And the Solomon Islands are only one year away from losing their loggable forest, which is their major export. And that's going to be spectacular for the economy of the Solomons. People often ask me, Jared, what's the most important thing that we need to do about the world's environmental problems? And my answer is, the most important thing we need to do is to forget about there being any single thing that is the most important thing we need to do. Instead, there are a dozen things, any one of which could do us in. And we've got to get them all right, because if we solve 11, we fail to solve the 12th \u2014 we're in trouble. For example, if we solve our problems of water and soil and population, but don't solve our problems of toxics, then we are in trouble.The fact is that our present course is a non-sustainable course, which means, by definition, that it cannot be maintained. And the outcome is going to get resolved within a few decades. That means that those of us in this room who are less than 50 or 60 years old will see how these paradoxes are resolved, and those of us who are over the age of 60 may not see the resolution, but our children and grandchildren certainly will. The resolution is going to achieve either of two forms: either we will resolve these non-sustainable time-fuses in pleasant ways of our own choice by taking remedial action, or else these conflicts are going to get settled in unpleasant ways not of our choice \u2014 namely, by war, disease or starvation. But what's for sure is that our non-sustainable course will get resolved in one way or another in a few decades. In other words, since the theme of this session is choices, we have a choice. Does that mean that we should get pessimistic and overwhelmed? I draw the reverse conclusion.The big problems facing the world today are not at all things beyond our control. Our biggest threat is not an asteroid about to crash into us, something we can do nothing about. Instead, all the major threats facing us today are problems entirely of our own making. And since we made the problems, we can also solve the problems. That then means that it's entirely in our power to deal with these problems. In particular, what can all of us do? For those of you who are interested in these choices, there are lots of things you can do. There's a lot that we don't understand, and that we need to understand. And there's a lot that we already do understand, but aren't doing, and that we need to be doing. Thank you.

And I'll illustrate that five-point\n\n00:02:03.958 --> 00:02:07.958\nframework by the extinction of the Greenland Norse society.\n\n00:02:08.958 --> 00:02:11.958\nThis is a European society with literate records,\n\n00:02:11.958 --> 00:02:14.958\nso we know a good deal about the people and their motivation.\n\n00:02:15.958 --> 00:02:19.958\nIn AD 984 Vikings went out to Greenland, settled Greenland,\n\n00:02:19.958 --> 00:02:23.958\nand around 1450 they died out -- the society collapsed,\n\n00:02:23.958 --> 00:02:25.958\nand every one of them ended up dead.\n\n00:02:25.958 --> 00:02:29.958\nWhy did they all end up dead?

And in the case of the Viking Norse,\n\n00:02:41.958 --> 00:02:46.958\nthe Vikings inadvertently caused soil erosion and deforestation,\n\n00:02:46.958 --> 00:02:48.958\nwhich was a particular problem for them because\n\n00:02:49.958 --> 00:02:52.958\nthey required forests to make charcoal, to make iron.\n\n00:02:52.958 --> 00:02:56.958\nSo they ended up an Iron Age European society, virtually\n\n00:02:56.958 --> 00:03:00.958\nunable to make their own iron. A second item on my checklist is\n\n00:03:01.958 --> 00:03:06.958\nclimate change. Climate can get warmer or colder or dryer or wetter.\n\n00:03:07.958 --> 00:03:10.958\nIn the case of the Vikings -- in Greenland, the climate got colder\n\n00:03:11.958 --> 00:03:15.958\nin the late 1300s, and especially in the 1400s. But a cold climate\n\n00:03:15.958 --> 00:03:19.958\nisn't necessarily fatal, because the Inuit -- the Eskimos inhabiting\n\n00:03:20.958 --> 00:03:22.958\nGreenland at the same time -- did better, rather than worse,\n\n00:03:22.958 --> 00:03:25.958\nwith cold climates. So why didn't the Greenland Norse as well?\n\n00:03:26.958 --> 00:03:29.958\nThe third thing on my checklist is relations with neighboring\n\n00:03:30.958 --> 00:03:34.958\nfriendly societies that may prop up a society. And if that\n\n00:03:34.958 --> 00:03:37.958\nfriendly support is pulled away, that may make a society\n\n00:03:37.958 --> 00:03:40.958\nmore likely to collapse. In the case of the Greenland Norse,\n\n00:03:41.958 --> 00:03:43.958\nthey had trade with the mother country -- Norway --\n\n00:03:43.958 --> 00:03:47.958\nand that trade dwindled: partly because Norway got weaker,\n\n00:03:47.958 --> 00:03:50.958\npartly because of sea ice between Greenland and Norway.\n\n00:03:52.958 --> 00:03:57.958\nThe fourth item on my checklist is relations with hostile societies.\n\n00:03:58.958 --> 00:04:01.958\nIn the case of Norse Greenland, the hostiles were the Inuit --\n\n00:04:01.958 --> 00:04:04.958\nthe Eskimos sharing Greenland -- with whom the Norse\n\n00:04:05.958 --> 00:04:09.958\ngot off to bad relationships. And we know that the Inuit\n\n00:04:09.958 --> 00:04:12.958\nkilled the Norse and, probably of greater importance,\n\n00:04:12.958 --> 00:04:16.958\nmay have blocked access to the outer fjords, on which\n\n00:04:16.958 --> 00:04:20.958\nthe Norse depended for seals at a critical time of the year.\n\n00:04:20.958 --> 00:04:24.958\nAnd then finally, the fifth item on my checklist is the political,\n\n00:04:24.958 --> 00:04:28.958\neconomic, social and cultural factors in the society that make it\n\n00:04:28.958 --> 00:04:32.958\nmore or less likely that the society will perceive and solve its\n\n00:04:32.958 --> 00:04:36.958\nenvironmental problems. In the case of the Greenland Norse,\n\n00:04:37.958 --> 00:04:39.958\ncultural factors that made it difficult for them\n\n00:04:39.958 --> 00:04:42.958\nto solve their problems were: their commitments to a\n\n00:04:42.958 --> 00:04:46.958\nChristian society investing heavily in cathedrals; their being\n\n00:04:46.958 --> 00:04:51.958\na competitive-ranked chiefly society; and their scorn for the Inuit,\n\n00:04:52.958 --> 00:04:55.958\nfrom whom they refused to learn. So that's how the five-part\n\n00:04:55.958 --> 00:05:00.958\nframework is relevant to the collapse and eventual extinction of the Greenland Norse.\n\n00:05:00.958 --> 00:05:03.958\nWhat about a society today?\n\n00:05:03.958 --> 00:05:07.958\nFor the past five years, I've been taking my wife and kids to\n\n00:05:07.958 --> 00:05:10.958\nSouthwestern Montana, where I worked as a teenager\n\n00:05:10.958 --> 00:05:13.958\non the hay harvest. And Montana, at first sight, seems\n\n00:05:14.958 --> 00:05:17.958\nlike the most pristine environment in the United States.\n\n00:05:17.958 --> 00:05:22.958\nBut scratch the surface, and Montana suffers from serious problems.\n\n00:05:22.958 --> 00:05:25.958\nGoing through the same checklist: human environmental impacts?\n\n00:05:26.958 --> 00:05:30.958\nYes, acute in Montana. Toxic problems from mine waste\n\n00:05:31.958 --> 00:05:33.958\nhave caused damage of billions of dollars.\n\n00:05:34.958 --> 00:05:37.958\nProblems from weeds, weed control, cost Montana nearly\n\n00:05:37.958 --> 00:05:41.958\n200 million dollars a year. Montana has lost agricultural areas\n\n00:05:41.958 --> 00:05:44.958\nfrom salinization, problems of forest management,\n\n00:05:45.958 --> 00:05:48.958\nproblems of forest fires. Second item on my checklist:\n\n00:05:49.958 --> 00:05:52.958\nclimate change. Yes -- the climate in Montana is getting warmer\n\n00:05:52.958 --> 00:05:56.958\nand drier, but Montana agriculture depends especially on irrigation\n\n00:05:56.958 --> 00:05:59.958\nfrom the snow pack, and as the snow is melting -- for example,\n\n00:06:00.958 --> 00:06:03.958\nas the glaciers in Glacier National Park are disappearing --\n\n00:06:03.958 --> 00:06:06.958\nthat's bad news for Montana irrigation agriculture.\n\n00:06:07.958 --> 00:06:09.958\nThird thing on my checklist: relations with friendlies\n\n00:06:09.958 --> 00:06:13.958\nthat can sustain the society. In Montana today, more than half of\n\n00:06:13.958 --> 00:06:16.958\nthe income of Montana is not earned within Montana,\n\n00:06:17.958 --> 00:06:20.958\nbut is derived from out of state: transfer payments from\n\n00:06:20.958 --> 00:06:22.958\nsocial security, investments and so on --\n\n00:06:23.958 --> 00:06:26.958\nwhich makes Montana vulnerable to the rest of the United States.\n\n00:06:27.958 --> 00:06:31.958\nFourth: relations with hostiles. Montanans have the same problems\n\n00:06:31.958 --> 00:06:35.958\nas do all Americans, in being sensitive to problems\n\n00:06:35.958 --> 00:06:39.958\ncreated by hostiles overseas affecting our oil supplies,\n\n00:06:39.958 --> 00:06:44.958\nand terrorist attacks. And finally, last item on my checklist:\n\n00:06:45.958 --> 00:06:47.958\nquestion of how political, economic, social, cultural attitudes\n\n00:06:48.958 --> 00:06:52.958\nplay into this. Montanans have long-held values, which today\n\n00:06:53.958 --> 00:06:55.958\nseem to be getting in the way of their solving their own problems.\n\n00:06:56.958 --> 00:07:00.958\nLong-held devotion to logging and to mines and to agriculture,\n\n00:07:00.958 --> 00:07:04.958\nand to no government regulation; values that worked well\n\n00:07:04.958 --> 00:07:06.958\nin the past, but they don't seem to be working well today.\n\n00:07:08.958 --> 00:07:10.958\nSo, I'm looking at these issues of collapses\n\n00:07:10.958 --> 00:07:14.958\nfor a lot of past societies and for many present societies.\n\n00:07:15.958 --> 00:07:17.958\nAre there any general conclusions that arise?\n\n00:07:17.958 --> 00:07:21.958\nIn a way, just like Tolstoy's statement about every unhappy marriage\n\n00:07:22.958 --> 00:07:25.958\nbeing different, every collapsed or endangered society is different --\n\n00:07:25.958 --> 00:07:29.958\nthey all have different details. But nevertheless, there are certain\n\n00:07:29.958 --> 00:07:32.958\ncommon threads that emerge from these comparisons\n\n00:07:32.958 --> 00:07:35.958\nof past societies that did or did not collapse\n\n00:07:35.958 --> 00:07:41.958\nand threatened societies today. One interesting common thread\n\n00:07:42.958 --> 00:07:46.958\nhas to do with, in many cases, the rapidity of collapse\n\n00:07:46.958 --> 00:07:49.958\nafter a society reaches its peak. There are many societies\n\n00:07:50.958 --> 00:07:53.958\nthat don't wind down gradually, but they build up -- get richer\n\n00:07:53.958 --> 00:07:56.958\nand more powerful -- and then within a short time, within a few decades\n\n00:07:57.958 --> 00:07:59.958\nafter their peak, they collapse. For example,\n\n00:07:59.958 --> 00:08:04.958\nthe classic lowland Maya of the Yucatan began to collapse in the\n\n00:08:05.958 --> 00:08:08.958\nearly 800s -- literally a few decades after the Maya were building\n\n00:08:08.958 --> 00:08:13.958\ntheir biggest monuments, and Maya population was greatest.\n\n00:08:13.958 --> 00:08:16.958\nOr again, the collapse of the Soviet Union took place\n\n00:08:16.958 --> 00:08:19.958\nwithin a couple of decades, maybe within a decade, of the time\n\n00:08:20.958 --> 00:08:22.958\nwhen the Soviet Union was at its greatest power.\n\n00:08:23.958 --> 00:08:27.958\nAn analogue would be the growth of bacteria in a petri dish.\n\n00:08:28.958 --> 00:08:31.958\nThese rapid collapses are especially likely where there's\n\n00:08:31.958 --> 00:08:35.958\na mismatch between available resources and resource consumption,\n\n00:08:36.958 --> 00:08:39.958\nor a mismatch between economic outlays and economic potential.\n\n00:08:40.958 --> 00:08:45.958\nIn a petri dish, bacteria grow. Say they double every generation,\n\n00:08:45.958 --> 00:08:50.958\nand five generations before the end the petri dish is 15/16ths empty,\n\n00:08:50.958 --> 00:08:53.958\nand then the next generation's 3/4ths empty, and the next generation\n\n00:08:54.958 --> 00:08:58.958\nhalf empty. Within one generation after the petri dish still\n\n00:08:58.958 --> 00:09:03.958\nbeing half empty, it is full. There's no more food and the bacteria have collapsed.\n\n00:09:03.958 --> 00:09:05.958\nSo, this is a frequent theme:\n\n00:09:05.958 --> 00:09:09.958\nsocieties collapse very soon after reaching their peak in power.\n\n00:09:10.958 --> 00:09:12.958\nWhat it means to put it mathematically is that, if you're concerned\n\n00:09:12.958 --> 00:09:17.958\nabout a society today, you should be looking not at the value\n\n00:09:17.958 --> 00:09:20.958\nof the mathematical function -- the wealth itself -- but you should\n\n00:09:20.958 --> 00:09:23.958\nbe looking at the first derivative and the second derivatives\n\n00:09:23.958 --> 00:09:27.958\nof the function. That's one general theme. A second general theme\n\n00:09:28.958 --> 00:09:33.958\nis that there are many, often subtle environmental factors that make\n\n00:09:33.958 --> 00:09:37.958\nsome societies more fragile than others. Many of those factors\n\n00:09:37.958 --> 00:09:40.958\nare not well understood. For example, why is it that in the Pacific,\n\n00:09:41.958 --> 00:09:45.958\nof those hundreds of Pacific islands, why did Easter Island end up as\n\n00:09:45.958 --> 00:09:48.958\nthe most devastating case of complete deforestation?\n\n00:09:49.958 --> 00:09:52.958\nIt turns out that there were about nine different environmental\n\n00:09:52.958 --> 00:09:55.958\nfactors -- some, rather subtle ones -- that were working against\n\n00:09:56.958 --> 00:10:00.958\nthe Easter Islanders, and they involve fallout of volcanic tephra,\n\n00:10:01.958 --> 00:10:04.958\nlatitude, rainfall. Perhaps the most subtle of them\n\n00:10:04.958 --> 00:10:06.958\nis that it turns out that a major input of nutrients\n\n00:10:07.958 --> 00:10:11.958\nwhich protects island environments in the Pacific is from\n\n00:10:11.958 --> 00:10:14.958\nthe fallout of continental dust from central Asia.\n\n00:10:14.958 --> 00:10:18.958\nEaster, of all Pacific islands, has the least input of dust\n\n00:10:18.958 --> 00:10:21.958\nfrom Asia restoring the fertility of its soils. But that's\n\n00:10:22.958 --> 00:10:25.958\na factor that we didn't even appreciate until 1999.\n\n00:10:27.958 --> 00:10:29.958\nSo, some societies, for subtle environmental reasons,\n\n00:10:29.958 --> 00:10:32.958\nare more fragile than others. And then finally,\n\n00:10:32.958 --> 00:10:34.958\nanother generalization. I'm now teaching a course\n\n00:10:35.958 --> 00:10:38.958\nat UCLA, to UCLA undergraduates, on these collapses\n\n00:10:38.958 --> 00:10:42.958\nof societies. What really bugs my UCLA undergraduate students is,\n\n00:10:42.958 --> 00:10:45.958\nhow on earth did these societies not see what they were doing?\n\n00:10:45.958 --> 00:10:48.958\nHow could the Easter Islanders have deforested their environment?\n\n00:10:48.958 --> 00:10:51.958\nWhat did they say when they were cutting down the last palm tree?\n\n00:10:52.958 --> 00:10:55.958\nDidn't they see what they were doing? How could societies\n\n00:10:55.958 --> 00:10:59.958\nnot perceive their impacts on the environments and stop in time?\n\n00:11:00.958 --> 00:11:06.958\nAnd I would expect that, if our human civilization carries on,\n\n00:11:07.958 --> 00:11:10.958\nthen maybe in the next century people will be asking,\n\n00:11:10.958 --> 00:11:13.958\nwhy on earth did these people today in the year 2003 not see\n\n00:11:14.958 --> 00:11:17.958\nthe obvious things that they were doing and take corrective action?\n\n00:11:18.958 --> 00:11:20.958\nIt seems incredible in the past. In the future, it'll seem\n\n00:11:21.958 --> 00:11:24.958\nincredible what we are doing today. And so I've been\n\n00:11:24.958 --> 00:11:29.958\ntrying to develop a hierarchical set of considerations\n\n00:11:29.958 --> 00:11:32.958\nabout why societies fail to solve their problems --\n\n00:11:33.958 --> 00:11:35.958\nwhy they fail to perceive the problems or, if they perceive them,\n\n00:11:35.958 --> 00:11:38.958\nwhy they fail to tackle them. Or, if they tackle them,\n\n00:11:38.958 --> 00:11:40.958\nwhy do they fail to succeed in solving them?\n\n00:11:41.958 --> 00:11:44.958\nI'll just mention two generalizations in this area.\n\n00:11:45.958 --> 00:11:47.958\nOne blueprint for trouble, making collapse likely,\n\n00:11:48.958 --> 00:11:51.958\nis where there is a conflict of interest between the short-term\n\n00:11:51.958 --> 00:11:55.958\ninterest of the decision-making elites and the long-term\n\n00:11:55.958 --> 00:11:58.958\ninterest of the society as a whole, especially if the elites\n\n00:11:59.958 --> 00:12:01.958\nare able to insulate themselves from the consequences\n\n00:12:01.958 --> 00:12:05.958\nof their actions. Where what's good in the short run for the elite\n\n00:12:05.958 --> 00:12:09.958\nis bad for the society as a whole, there's a real risk of the elite\n\n00:12:09.958 --> 00:12:11.958\ndoing things that would bring the society down in the long run.\n\n00:12:12.958 --> 00:12:14.958\nFor example, among the Greenland Norse --\n\n00:12:14.958 --> 00:12:17.958\na competitive rank society -- what the chiefs really wanted\n\n00:12:17.958 --> 00:12:19.958\nis more followers and more sheep and more resources\n\n00:12:20.958 --> 00:12:23.958\nto outcompete the neighboring chiefs. And that led the chiefs\n\n00:12:23.958 --> 00:12:27.958\nto do what's called flogging the land: overstocking the land,\n\n00:12:27.958 --> 00:12:31.958\nforcing tenant farmers into dependency. And that made\n\n00:12:31.958 --> 00:12:35.958\nthe chiefs powerful in the short run,\n\n00:12:35.958 --> 00:12:38.958\nbut led to the society's collapse in the long run.\n\n00:12:39.958 --> 00:12:42.958\nThose same issues of conflicts of interest are acute\n\n00:12:42.958 --> 00:12:45.958\nin the United States today. Especially because\n\n00:12:45.958 --> 00:12:48.958\nthe decision makers in the United States are frequently\n\n00:12:49.958 --> 00:12:51.958\nable to insulate themselves from consequences\n\n00:12:52.958 --> 00:12:54.958\nby living in gated compounds, by drinking bottled water\n\n00:12:55.958 --> 00:12:58.958\nand so on. And within the last couple of years,\n\n00:12:58.958 --> 00:13:01.958\nit's been obvious that the elite in the business world\n\n00:13:02.958 --> 00:13:04.958\ncorrectly perceive that they can advance\n\n00:13:04.958 --> 00:13:06.958\ntheir short-term interest by doing things that are\n\n00:13:07.958 --> 00:13:09.958\ngood for them but bad for society as a whole,\n\n00:13:09.958 --> 00:13:12.958\nsuch as draining a few billion dollars out of Enron\n\n00:13:12.958 --> 00:13:15.958\nand other businesses. They are quite correct\n\n00:13:16.958 --> 00:13:19.958\nthat these things are good for them in the short term,\n\n00:13:19.958 --> 00:13:21.958\nalthough bad for society in the long term.\n\n00:13:22.958 --> 00:13:25.958\nSo, that's one general conclusion about why societies\n\n00:13:25.958 --> 00:13:29.958\nmake bad decisions: conflicts of interest.\n\n00:13:29.958 --> 00:13:31.958\nAnd the other generalization that I want to mention\n\n00:13:33.958 --> 00:13:35.958\nis that it's particularly hard for a society to make\n\n00:13:35.958 --> 00:13:41.958\nquote-unquote good decisions when there is a conflict involving\n\n00:13:41.958 --> 00:13:45.958\nstrongly held values that are good in many circumstances\n\n00:13:46.958 --> 00:13:49.958\nbut are poor in other circumstances. For example,\n\n00:13:49.958 --> 00:13:52.958\nthe Greenland Norse, in this difficult environment,\n\n00:13:52.958 --> 00:13:55.958\nwere held together for four-and-a-half centuries\n\n00:13:55.958 --> 00:13:57.958\nby their shared commitment to religion,\n\n00:13:58.958 --> 00:14:02.958\nand by their strong social cohesion. But those two things --\n\n00:14:02.958 --> 00:14:04.958\ncommitment to religion and strong social cohesion --\n\n00:14:05.958 --> 00:14:08.958\nalso made it difficult for them to change at the end\n\n00:14:08.958 --> 00:14:11.958\nand to learn from the Inuit. Or today -- Australia.\n\n00:14:11.958 --> 00:14:14.958\nOne of the things that enabled Australia to survive\n\n00:14:14.958 --> 00:14:17.958\nin this remote outpost of European civilization\n\n00:14:17.958 --> 00:14:21.958\nfor 250 years has been their British identity.\n\n00:14:21.958 --> 00:14:25.958\nBut today, their commitment to a British identity\n\n00:14:25.958 --> 00:14:28.958\nis serving Australians poorly in their need to adapt\n\n00:14:28.958 --> 00:14:32.958\nto their situation in Asia. So it's particularly difficult\n\n00:14:32.958 --> 00:14:36.958\nto change course when the things that get you in trouble\n\n00:14:36.958 --> 00:14:39.958\nare the things that are also the source of your strength.\n\n00:14:40.958 --> 00:14:42.958\nWhat's going to be the outcome today?\n\n00:14:42.958 --> 00:14:48.958\nWell, all of us know the dozen sorts of ticking time bombs\n\n00:14:48.958 --> 00:14:54.958\ngoing on in the modern world, time bombs that have fuses\n\n00:14:54.958 --> 00:14:57.958\nof a few decades to -- all of them, not more than 50 years,\n\n00:14:58.958 --> 00:15:02.958\nand any one of which can do us in; the time bombs of water,\n\n00:15:03.958 --> 00:15:07.958\nof soil, of climate change, invasive species,\n\n00:15:07.958 --> 00:15:11.958\nthe photosynthetic ceiling, population problems, toxics, etc., etc. --\n\n00:15:12.958 --> 00:15:15.958\nlisting about 12 of them. And while these time bombs --\n\n00:15:16.958 --> 00:15:18.958\nnone of them has a fuse beyond 50 years, and most of them\n\n00:15:18.958 --> 00:15:21.958\nhave fuses of a few decades -- some of them, in some places,\n\n00:15:21.958 --> 00:15:24.958\nhave much shorter fuses. At the rate at which we're going now,\n\n00:15:25.958 --> 00:15:29.958\nthe Philippines will lose all its accessible loggable forest\n\n00:15:29.958 --> 00:15:31.958\nwithin five years. And the Solomon Islands are only\n\n00:15:32.958 --> 00:15:35.958\none year away from losing their loggable forest,\n\n00:15:35.958 --> 00:15:37.958\nwhich is their major export. And that's going to be spectacular\n\n00:15:37.958 --> 00:15:41.958\nfor the economy of the Solomons. People often ask me,\n\n00:15:41.958 --> 00:15:43.958\nJared, what's the most important thing that we need to do\n\n00:15:44.958 --> 00:15:45.958\nabout the world's environmental problems?\n\n00:15:46.958 --> 00:15:48.958\nAnd my answer is, the most important thing we need to do\n\n00:15:48.958 --> 00:15:51.958\nis to forget about there being any single thing that is\n\n00:15:51.958 --> 00:15:52.958\nthe most important thing we need to do.\n\n00:15:53.958 --> 00:15:56.958\nInstead, there are a dozen things, any one of which could do us in.\n\n00:15:56.958 --> 00:15:59.958\nAnd we've got to get them all right, because if we solve 11,\n\n00:15:59.958 --> 00:16:02.958\nwe fail to solve the 12th -- we're in trouble. For example,\n\n00:16:02.958 --> 00:16:05.958\nif we solve our problems of water and soil and population,\n\n00:16:05.958 --> 00:16:09.958\nbut don't solve our problems of toxics, then we are in trouble.\n\n00:16:11.958 --> 00:16:16.958\nThe fact is that our present course is a non-sustainable course,\n\n00:16:16.958 --> 00:16:19.958\nwhich means, by definition, that it cannot be maintained.\n\n00:16:20.958 --> 00:16:26.958\nAnd the outcome is going to get resolved within a few decades.\n\n00:16:27.958 --> 00:16:30.958\nThat means that those of us in this room who are less than\n\n00:16:30.958 --> 00:16:34.958\n50 or 60 years old will see how these paradoxes are resolved,\n\n00:16:34.958 --> 00:16:37.958\nand those of us who are over the age of 60 may not see\n\n00:16:37.958 --> 00:16:40.958\nthe resolution, but our children and grandchildren certainly will.\n\n00:16:41.958 --> 00:16:43.958\nThe resolution is going to achieve either of two forms:\n\n00:16:44.958 --> 00:16:48.958\neither we will resolve these non-sustainable time-fuses\n\n00:16:49.958 --> 00:16:54.958\nin pleasant ways of our own choice by taking remedial action,\n\n00:16:54.958 --> 00:16:57.958\nor else these conflicts are going to get settled\n\n00:16:57.958 --> 00:17:00.958\nin unpleasant ways not of our choice -- namely, by war,\n\n00:17:01.958 --> 00:17:04.958\ndisease or starvation. But what's for sure is that our\n\n00:17:05.958 --> 00:17:07.958\nnon-sustainable course will get resolved in one way or another\n\n00:17:07.958 --> 00:17:11.958\nin a few decades. In other words, since the theme of this session\n\n00:17:11.958 --> 00:17:16.958\nis choices, we have a choice. Does that mean that we should\n\n00:17:16.958 --> 00:17:20.958\nget pessimistic and overwhelmed? I draw the reverse conclusion.\n\n00:17:21.958 --> 00:17:24.958\nThe big problems facing the world today are not at all\n\n00:17:24.958 --> 00:17:28.958\nthings beyond our control. Our biggest threat is not an asteroid\n\n00:17:28.958 --> 00:17:31.958\nabout to crash into us, something we can do nothing about.\n\n00:17:32.958 --> 00:17:35.958\nInstead, all the major threats facing us today are problems\n\n00:17:35.958 --> 00:17:39.958\nentirely of our own making. And since we made the problems,\n\n00:17:39.958 --> 00:17:43.958\nwe can also solve the problems. That then means that it's\n\n00:17:43.958 --> 00:17:46.958\nentirely in our power to deal with these problems.\n\n00:17:47.958 --> 00:17:50.958\nIn particular, what can all of us do? For those of you\n\n00:17:50.958 --> 00:17:53.958\nwho are interested in these choices, there are lots of things\n\n00:17:53.958 --> 00:17:56.958\nyou can do. There's a lot that we don't understand,\n\n00:17:57.958 --> 00:18:00.958\nand that we need to understand. And there's a lot that\n\n00:18:00.958 --> 00:18:04.958\nwe already do understand, but aren't doing, and that\n\n00:18:04.958 --> 00:18:06.958\nwe need to be doing. Thank you.\n\n00:18:06.958 --> 00:18:09.958\n(Applause)"}, {"title": "A story of mixed emoticons", "duration": "197", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/rives_tells_a_story_of_mixed_emoticons", "transcript": "This means, \"I'm smiling.\" So does that.

We investigate materials and technologies that have unexpected properties. Over the last three years, we found over 200 of these things, and so we looked back into our library and selected six we thought would be most surprising for TED. Of these six, the first one that we're going to talk about is in the black envelope you're holding. It comes from a company in Japan called GelTech. Now go ahead and open it up.Keith Schacht: Now be sure and take the two pieces apart. What's unexpected about this is that it's soft, but it's also a strong magnet. Zach and I have always been fascinated observing unexpected things like this. We spent a long time thinking about why this is, and it's just recently that we realized: it's when we see something unexpected, it changes our understanding of the way things work. As you're seeing this gel magnet for the first time, if you assume that all magnets had to be hard, then seeing this surprised you and it changed your understanding of the way magnets could work.ZK: Now, it's important to understand what the unexpected properties are. But to really think about the implications of what this makes possible, we found that it helps to think about how it could be applied in the world. So, a first idea is to use it on cabinet doors. If you line the sides of the cabinets using the gel material \u2014 if a cabinet slams shut it wouldn't make a loud noise, and in addition the magnets would draw the cabinets closed. Imagine taking the same material, but putting it on the bottom of a sneaker. You know, this way you could go to the container store and buy one of those metal sheets that they hang on the back of your door, in your closet, and you could literally stick your shoes up instead of using a shelf. For me, I really love this idea. (Laughter) If you come to my apartment and see my closet, I'm sure you'd figure out why: it's a mess.KS: Seeing the unexpected properties and then seeing a couple of applications \u2014 it helps you see why this is significant, what the potential is. But we've found that the way we present our ideas it makes a big difference.ZK: It was like six months ago that Keith and I were out in L.A., and we were at Starbucks having coffee with Roman Coppola. He works on mostly music videos and commercials with his company, The Directors Bureau. As we were talking, Roman told us that he's kind of an inventor on the side. And we were showing him the same gel magnet that you're holding in your hand \u2014 and you know, we shared the same ideas. And you could see it in his face: Roman starts to get really excited and he whips out this manila folder; he opens it up and Keith and I look in, and he starts showing us concepts that he's been working on. These things just get him really excited. And so we're looking at these concepts, and we were just like, whoa, this guy's good. Because the way that he presented the concept \u2014 his approach was totally different than ours. He sold it to you as if it was for sale right now. When we were going in the car back to the airport, we were thinking: why was this so powerful? And as we thought about it more, we realized that it let you fill in all the details about the experience, just as if you saw it on TV. So, for TED we decided to take our favorite idea for the gel magnet and work with Roman and his team at the Directors Bureau to create a commercial for a product from the future.Narrator: Do you have a need for speed? Inventables Water Adventures dares you to launch yourself on a magnetically-levitating board down a waterslide so fast, so tall, that when you hit the bottom, it uses brakes to stop. Aqua Rocket: coming this summer.KS: Now, we showed the concept to a few people before this, and they asked us, when's it coming out? So I just wanted to let you know, it's not actually coming out, just the concept is.ZK: So now, when we dream up these concepts, it's important for us to make sure that they work from a technical standpoint. So I just want to quickly explain how this would work. This is the magnetically-levitating board that they mentioned in the commercial. The gel that you're holding would be lining the bottom of the board. Now this is important for two reasons. One: the soft properties of the magnet that make it so that, if it were to hit the rider in the head, it wouldn't injure him. In addition, you can see from the diagram on the right, the underpart of the slide would be an electromagnet. So this would actually repel the rider a little bit as you're going down. The force of the water rushing down, in addition to that repulsion force, would make this slide go faster than any slide on the market. It's because of this that you need the magnetic braking system. When you get to the very bottom of the slide \u2014 (Laughter) \u2014 the rider passes through an aluminum tube. And I'm going to kick it to Keith to explain why that's important from a technical standpoint.KS: So I'm sure all you engineers know that even though aluminum is a metal, it's not a magnetic material. But something unexpected happens when you drop a magnet down an aluminum tube. So we set up a quick experiment here to show that to you. (Laughter) Now, you see the magnet fell really slowly. Now, I'm not going to get into the physics of it, but all you need to know is that the faster the magnet's falling, the greater the stopping force.ZK: Now, our next technology is actually a 10-foot pole, and I have it right here in my pocket. (Laughter) There're a few different versions of it. (Laughter) KS: Some of them automatically unroll like this one. They can be made to automatically roll up, or they can be made stable, like Zach's, to hold any position in between.ZK: As we were talking to the vendor \u2014 to try to learn about how you could apply these, or how they're being applied currently \u2014 he was telling us that, in the military they use this one so soldiers can keep it on their chests \u2014 very concealed \u2014 and then, when they're out on the field, erect it as an antenna to clearly send signals back to the base. In our brainstorms, we came up with the idea you could use it for a soccer goal: so at the end of the game, you just roll up the goal and put it in your gym bag. (Laughter)KS: Now, the interesting thing about this is, you don't have to be an engineer to appreciate why a 10-foot pole that can fit in your pocket is so interesting. (Laughter) So we decided to go out onto the streets of Chicago and ask a few people on the streets what they thought you could do with this.Man: I clean my ceiling fans with that and I get the spider webs off my house \u2014 I do it that way. Woman: I'd make my very own walking stick. Woman: I would create a ladder to use to get up on top of the tree. Woman: An olive server. Man: Some type of extension pole \u2014 like what the painters use. Woman: I would make a spear that, when you went deep sea diving, you could catch the fish really fast, and then roll it back up, and you could swim easier ... Yeah. (Laughter)ZK: Now, for our next technology we're going to do a little demonstration, and so we need a volunteer from the audience. You sir, come on up. (Laughter) Come on up. Tell everybody your name.Steve Jurvetson: Steve.ZK: It's Steve. All right Steve, now, follow me. We need you to stand right in front of the TED sign. Right there. That's great. And hold onto this. Good luck to you. (Laughter)KS: No, not yet. (Laughter)ZK: I'd just like to let you all know that this presentation has been brought to you by Target.KS: Little bit \u2014 that's perfect, just perfect. Now, Zach, we're going to demonstrate a water gun fight from the future. (Laughter) So here, come on up to the front. All right, so now if you'll see here \u2014 no, no, it's OK. So, describe to the audience the temperature of your shirt. Go ahead.SJ: It's cold.KS: Now the reason it's cold is that's it's not actually water loaded into these squirt guns \u2014 it's a dry liquid developed by 3M. It's perfectly clear, it's odorless, it's colorless. It's so safe you could drink this stuff. (Laughter) And the reason it feels cold is because it evaporates 25 times faster than water. (Laughter) All right, well thanks for coming up. (Laughter)ZK: Wait, wait, Steven \u2014 before you go we filled this with the dry liquid so during the break you can shoot your friends. SJ: Excellent, thank you.KS: Thanks for coming up. Let's give him a big round of applause. (Applause)So what's the significance of this dry liquid? Early versions of the fluid were actually used on a Cray Supercomputer. Now, the unexpected thing about this is that Zach could stand up on stage and drench a perfectly innocent member of the audience without any concern that we'd damage the electronics, that we'd get him wet, that we'd hurt the books or the computers. It works because it's non-conductive. So you can see here, you can immerse a whole circuit board in this and it wouldn't cause any damage. You can circulate it to draw the heat away. But today it's most widely used in office buildings \u2014 in the sprinkler system \u2014 as a fire-suppression fluid. Again, it's perfectly safe for people. It puts out the fires, doesn't hurt anything. But our favorite idea for this was using it in a basketball game. So during halftime, it could rain down on the players, cool everyone down, and in a matter of minutes it would dry. Wouldn't hurt the court.ZK: Our next technology comes to us from a company in Japan called Sekisui Chemical. One of their R&D engineers was working on a way to make plastic stiffer. While he was doing this, he noticed an unexpected thing. We have a video to show you.KS: So you see there, it didn't bounce back. Now, this was an unintended side effect of some experiments they were doing. It's technically called, \"shape-retaining property.\" Now, think about your interactions with aluminum foil. Shape-retaining is common in metal: you bend a piece of aluminum foil, and it holds its place. Contrast that with a plastic garbage can \u2014 and you can push in the sides and it always bounces back.ZK: For example, you could make a watch that wraps around your wrist, but doesn't use a buckle. Taking it a little further, if you wove those strips together \u2014 kind of like a little basket \u2014 you could make a shape-retaining sheet, and then you could embed it in a cloth: so you could make a picnic sheet that wraps around the table, so that way on a windy day it wouldn't blow away. For our next technology, it's hard to observe the unexpected property by itself, because it's an ink. So, we've prepared a video to show it applied to paper.KS: As this paper is bending, the resistance of the ink changes. So with simple electronics, you can detect how much the page is being bent. Now, to think about the potential for this, think of all the places ink is supplied: on business cards, on the back of cereal boxes, board games. Any place you use ink, you could change the way you interact with it.ZK: So my favorite idea for this is to apply the ink to a book. This could totally change the way that you interface with paper. You see the dark line on the side and the top. As you turn the pages of the book, the book can actually detect what page you're on, based on the curvature of the pages. In addition, if you were to fold in one of the corners, then you could program the book to actually email you the text on the page for your notes.KS: For our last technology, we worked again with Roman and his team at the Directors Bureau to develop a commercial from the future to explain how it works.Old Milk Carton: Oh yeah, it smells good. Who are you? New Milk Carton: I'm New Milk. OMC: I used to smell like you. Narrator: Fresh Watch, from Inventables Dairy Farms. Packaging that changes color when your milk's gone off. Don't let milk spoil your morning.ZK: Now, this technology was developed by these two guys: Professor Ken Suslick and Neil Rakow, of the University of Illinois.KS: Now the way it works: there's a matrix of color dyes. And these dyes change color in response to odors. So the smell of vanilla, that might change the four on the left to brown and the one on the right to yellow. This matrix can produce thousands of different color combinations to represent thousands of different smells. But like in the milk commercial, if you know what odor you want to detect, then they can formulate a specific dye to detect just that odor.ZK: Right. It was that that started a conversation with Professor Suslick and myself, and he was explaining to me the things that this is making possible, beyond just detecting spoiled food. It's really where the significance of it lies. His company actually did a survey of firemen all across the country to try to learn, how are they currently testing the air when they respond to an emergency scene? And he kind of comically explained that time after time, what the firemen would say is: they would rush to the scene of the crime; they would look around; if there were no dead policemen, it was OK to go. (Laughter) I mean, this is a true story. They're using policemen as canaries. (Laughter) But more seriously, they determined that you could develop a device that can smell better than the humans, and say if it's safe for the firemen. In addition, he's spun off a company from the University called ChemSensing, where they're working on medical equipment. So, a patient can come in and actually blow into their device. By detecting the odor of particular bacteria, or viruses, or even lung cancer, the dots will change and they can use software to analyze the results. This can radically improve the way that doctors diagnose patients. Currently, they're using a method of trial and error, but this could tell you precisely what disease you have.KS: So that was the six we had for you today, but I hope you're starting to see why we find these things so fascinating. Because every one of these six changed our understanding of what was possible in the world. Prior to seeing this, we would have assumed: a 10-foot pole couldn't fit in your pocket; something as inexpensive as ink couldn't sense the way paper is being bent; every one of these things \u2014 and we're constantly trying to find more.ZK: This is something that Keith and I really enjoy doing. I'm sure it's obvious to you now, but it was actually yesterday that I was reminded of why. I was having a conversation with Steve Jurvetson, over downstairs by the escalators, and he was telling me that when Chris sent out that little box, one of the items in it was the hydrophobic sand \u2014 the sand that doesn't get wet. He said that he was playing with it with his son. And you know, his son was mesmerized, because he would dunk it in the water, he would take it out and it was bone dry. A few weeks later, he said that his son was playing with a lock of his mother's hair, and he noticed that there were some drops of water on the hair. And he took the thing and he looked up to Steve and he said, \"Look, hydrophobic string.\" (Laughter) I mean, after hearing that story \u2014 that really summed it up for me. Thank you very much.KS: Thank you.

Over the last three years,\n\n00:00:19.958 --> 00:00:21.958\nwe found over 200 of these things, and so we looked\n\n00:00:21.958 --> 00:00:25.958\nback into our library and selected six we thought would be most\n\n00:00:25.958 --> 00:00:28.958\nsurprising for TED.\n\n00:00:28.958 --> 00:00:31.958\nOf these six, the first one that we're going to talk about\n\n00:00:31.958 --> 00:00:34.958\nis in the black envelope you're holding.\n\n00:00:34.958 --> 00:00:38.958\nIt comes from a company in Japan called GelTech. Now go ahead and open it up.\n\n00:00:43.958 --> 00:00:47.958\nKeith Schacht: Now be sure and take the two pieces apart.\n\n00:00:47.958 --> 00:00:54.958\nWhat's unexpected about this is that it's soft, but it's also a strong magnet.\n\n00:00:54.958 --> 00:00:57.958\nZach and I have always been fascinated\n\n00:00:57.958 --> 00:00:59.958\nobserving unexpected things like this.\n\n00:00:59.958 --> 00:01:03.958\nWe spent a long time thinking about why this is, and it's just recently that we realized:\n\n00:01:03.958 --> 00:01:05.958\nit's when we see something unexpected,\n\n00:01:05.958 --> 00:01:09.958\nit changes our understanding of the way things work.\n\n00:01:09.958 --> 00:01:11.958\nAs you're seeing this gel magnet for the first time,\n\n00:01:11.958 --> 00:01:14.958\nif you assume that all magnets had to be hard,\n\n00:01:14.958 --> 00:01:17.958\nthen seeing this surprised you and it changed your understanding\n\n00:01:17.958 --> 00:01:20.958\nof the way magnets could work.\n\n00:01:20.958 --> 00:01:23.958\nZK: Now, it's important to understand what the unexpected properties are.\n\n00:01:23.958 --> 00:01:27.958\nBut to really think about the implications of what this makes possible,\n\n00:01:27.958 --> 00:01:31.958\nwe found that it helps to think about how it could be applied in the world.\n\n00:01:31.958 --> 00:01:34.958\nSo, a first idea is to use it on cabinet doors.\n\n00:01:34.958 --> 00:01:39.958\nIf you line the sides of the cabinets using the gel material --\n\n00:01:39.958 --> 00:01:41.958\nif a cabinet slams shut it wouldn't make a loud noise,\n\n00:01:41.958 --> 00:01:44.958\nand in addition the magnets would draw the cabinets closed.\n\n00:01:44.958 --> 00:01:49.958\nImagine taking the same material, but putting it on the bottom of a sneaker.\n\n00:01:49.958 --> 00:01:52.958\nYou know, this way you could go to the container store and buy one of those\n\n00:01:52.958 --> 00:01:55.958\nmetal sheets that they hang on the back of your door, in your closet,\n\n00:01:55.958 --> 00:01:59.958\nand you could literally stick your shoes up instead of using a shelf.\n\n00:01:59.958 --> 00:02:02.958\nFor me, I really love this idea.\n\n00:02:02.958 --> 00:02:04.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:02:04.958 --> 00:02:06.958\nIf you come to my apartment and see my closet,\n\n00:02:06.958 --> 00:02:09.958\nI'm sure you'd figure out why: it's a mess.\n\n00:02:09.958 --> 00:02:11.958\nKS: Seeing the unexpected properties and then seeing a couple of\n\n00:02:11.958 --> 00:02:15.958\napplications -- it helps you see why this is significant, what the potential is.\n\n00:02:15.958 --> 00:02:18.958\nBut we've found that the way we present our ideas\n\n00:02:18.958 --> 00:02:21.958\nit makes a big difference.\n\n00:02:21.958 --> 00:02:24.958\nZK: It was like six months ago that Keith and I were out in L.A.,\n\n00:02:24.958 --> 00:02:27.958\nand we were at Starbucks having coffee with Roman Coppola.\n\n00:02:27.958 --> 00:02:30.958\nHe works on mostly music videos and commercials\n\n00:02:30.958 --> 00:02:32.958\nwith his company, The Directors Bureau.\n\n00:02:32.958 --> 00:02:36.958\nAs we were talking, Roman told us that he's kind of an inventor on the side.\n\n00:02:36.958 --> 00:02:37.958\nAnd we were showing him the same\n\n00:02:37.958 --> 00:02:39.958\ngel magnet that you're holding in your hand -- and you know,\n\n00:02:39.958 --> 00:02:42.958\nwe shared the same ideas. And you could see it in his face:\n\n00:02:42.958 --> 00:02:47.958\nRoman starts to get really excited and he whips out this manila folder;\n\n00:02:47.958 --> 00:02:50.958\nhe opens it up and Keith and I look in,\n\n00:02:50.958 --> 00:02:52.958\nand he starts showing us concepts that he's been working on.\n\n00:02:52.958 --> 00:02:55.958\nThese things just get him really excited. And so we're looking\n\n00:02:55.958 --> 00:03:02.958\nat these concepts, and we were just like, whoa, this guy's good.\n\n00:03:02.958 --> 00:03:06.958\nBecause the way that he presented the concept -- his approach\n\n00:03:06.958 --> 00:03:12.958\nwas totally different than ours. He sold it to you as if it was for sale right now.\n\n00:03:12.958 --> 00:03:15.958\nWhen we were going in the car back to the airport,\n\n00:03:15.958 --> 00:03:19.958\nwe were thinking: why was this so powerful?\n\n00:03:19.958 --> 00:03:20.958\nAnd as we thought about it more, we realized that\n\n00:03:20.958 --> 00:03:24.958\nit let you fill in all the details about the experience,\n\n00:03:24.958 --> 00:03:28.958\njust as if you saw it on TV. So, for TED we decided to take our favorite\n\n00:03:28.958 --> 00:03:31.958\nidea for the gel magnet and work with Roman and his team\n\n00:03:31.958 --> 00:03:35.958\nat the Directors Bureau to create a commercial for a product\n\n00:03:35.958 --> 00:03:37.958\nfrom the future.\n\n00:03:37.958 --> 00:03:40.958\nNarrator: Do you have a need for speed?\n\n00:03:40.958 --> 00:03:46.958\nInventables Water Adventures dares you to launch yourself\n\n00:03:46.958 --> 00:03:50.958\non a magnetically-levitating board down a waterslide\n\n00:03:50.958 --> 00:03:59.958\nso fast, so tall, that when you hit the bottom, it uses brakes to stop.\n\n00:04:01.958 --> 00:04:06.958\nAqua Rocket: coming this summer.\n\n00:04:08.958 --> 00:04:11.958\nKS: Now, we showed the concept to a few people before this,\n\n00:04:11.958 --> 00:04:13.958\nand they asked us, when's it coming out?\n\n00:04:13.958 --> 00:04:15.958\nSo I just wanted to let you know, it's not actually coming out,\n\n00:04:15.958 --> 00:04:17.958\njust the concept is.\n\n00:04:17.958 --> 00:04:20.958\nZK: So now, when we dream up these concepts, it's important for us\n\n00:04:20.958 --> 00:04:23.958\nto make sure that they work from a technical standpoint.\n\n00:04:23.958 --> 00:04:25.958\nSo I just want to quickly explain how this would work.\n\n00:04:25.958 --> 00:04:29.958\nThis is the magnetically-levitating board that they mentioned in the commercial.\n\n00:04:29.958 --> 00:04:32.958\nThe gel that you're holding would be lining the bottom of the board.\n\n00:04:32.958 --> 00:04:34.958\nNow this is important for two reasons.\n\n00:04:34.958 --> 00:04:36.958\nOne: the soft properties of the magnet that make it so that, if it were\n\n00:04:36.958 --> 00:04:38.958\nto hit the rider in the head, it wouldn't injure him.\n\n00:04:38.958 --> 00:04:40.958\nIn addition, you can see from the diagram on the right,\n\n00:04:40.958 --> 00:04:43.958\nthe underpart of the slide would be an electromagnet.\n\n00:04:43.958 --> 00:04:46.958\nSo this would actually repel the rider a little bit as you're going down.\n\n00:04:46.958 --> 00:04:49.958\nThe force of the water rushing down, in addition to that repulsion force,\n\n00:04:49.958 --> 00:04:52.958\nwould make this slide go faster than any slide on the market.\n\n00:04:52.958 --> 00:04:54.958\nIt's because of this that you need the magnetic braking system.\n\n00:04:54.958 --> 00:04:56.958\nWhen you get to the very bottom of the slide --\n\n00:04:56.958 --> 00:04:58.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:04:58.958 --> 00:05:00.958\n-- the rider passes through an aluminum tube.\n\n00:05:00.958 --> 00:05:02.958\nAnd I'm going to kick it to Keith to explain why that's important\n\n00:05:02.958 --> 00:05:03.958\nfrom a technical standpoint.\n\n00:05:03.958 --> 00:05:06.958\nKS: So I'm sure all you engineers know that even though aluminum is\n\n00:05:06.958 --> 00:05:10.958\na metal, it's not a magnetic material. But something unexpected\n\n00:05:10.958 --> 00:05:12.958\nhappens when you drop a magnet down an aluminum tube.\n\n00:05:12.958 --> 00:05:15.958\nSo we set up a quick experiment here to show that to you.\n\n00:05:23.958 --> 00:05:26.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:05:33.958 --> 00:05:36.958\nNow, you see the magnet fell really slowly.\n\n00:05:36.958 --> 00:05:38.958\nNow, I'm not going to get into the physics of it,\n\n00:05:38.958 --> 00:05:41.958\nbut all you need to know is that the faster the magnet's falling,\n\n00:05:41.958 --> 00:05:42.958\nthe greater the stopping force.\n\n00:05:42.958 --> 00:05:45.958\nZK: Now, our next technology is actually a 10-foot pole,\n\n00:05:45.958 --> 00:05:47.958\nand I have it right here in my pocket.\n\n00:05:47.958 --> 00:05:51.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:05:51.958 --> 00:05:53.958\nThere're a few different versions of it.\n\n00:05:53.958 --> 00:05:58.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:05:58.958 --> 00:06:00.958\nKS: Some of them automatically unroll like this one.\n\n00:06:00.958 --> 00:06:03.958\nThey can be made to automatically roll up, or they can be made\n\n00:06:03.958 --> 00:06:06.958\nstable, like Zach's, to hold any position in between.\n\n00:06:10.958 --> 00:06:13.958\nZK: As we were talking to the vendor -- to try to learn about\n\n00:06:13.958 --> 00:06:16.958\nhow you could apply these, or how they're being applied currently --\n\n00:06:16.958 --> 00:06:20.958\nhe was telling us that, in the military they use this one\n\n00:06:20.958 --> 00:06:22.958\nso soldiers can keep it on their chests -- very concealed --\n\n00:06:22.958 --> 00:06:25.958\nand then, when they're out on the field, erect it as an antenna\n\n00:06:25.958 --> 00:06:28.958\nto clearly send signals back to the base.\n\n00:06:28.958 --> 00:06:32.958\nIn our brainstorms, we came up with the idea you could use it for a soccer goal:\n\n00:06:32.958 --> 00:06:35.958\nso at the end of the game, you just roll up the goal and put it in your gym bag.\n\n00:06:35.958 --> 00:06:37.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:06:37.958 --> 00:06:39.958\nKS: Now, the interesting thing about this is,\n\n00:06:39.958 --> 00:06:41.958\nyou don't have to be an engineer to appreciate why\n\n00:06:41.958 --> 00:06:44.958\na 10-foot pole that can fit in your pocket is so interesting.\n\n00:06:44.958 --> 00:06:47.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:06:47.958 --> 00:06:49.958\nSo we decided to go out onto the streets of Chicago\n\n00:06:49.958 --> 00:06:52.958\nand ask a few people on the streets what they thought you could do with this.\n\n00:06:52.958 --> 00:06:55.958\nMan: I clean my ceiling fans with that and I get the spider webs\n\n00:06:55.958 --> 00:06:57.958\noff my house -- I do it that way.\n\n00:06:57.958 --> 00:06:59.958\nWoman: I'd make my very own walking stick.\n\n00:06:59.958 --> 00:07:03.958\nWoman: I would create a ladder to use to get up on top of the tree.\n\n00:07:03.958 --> 00:07:05.958\nWoman: An olive server.\n\n00:07:05.958 --> 00:07:09.958\nMan: Some type of extension pole -- like what the painters use.\n\n00:07:09.958 --> 00:07:12.958\nWoman: I would make a spear that, when you went deep sea diving,\n\n00:07:12.958 --> 00:07:16.958\nyou could catch the fish really fast, and then roll it back up,\n\n00:07:16.958 --> 00:07:20.958\nand you could swim easier ...

Go ahead.\n\n00:08:27.958 --> 00:08:29.958\nSJ: It's cold.\n\n00:08:29.958 --> 00:08:31.958\nKS: Now the reason it's cold is that's it's not actually water loaded\n\n00:08:31.958 --> 00:08:35.958\ninto these squirt guns -- it's a dry liquid developed by 3M.\n\n00:08:35.958 --> 00:08:40.958\nIt's perfectly clear, it's odorless, it's colorless.\n\n00:08:40.958 --> 00:08:42.958\nIt's so safe you could drink this stuff.\n\n00:08:42.958 --> 00:08:44.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:08:44.958 --> 00:08:47.958\nAnd the reason it feels cold is because it evaporates\n\n00:08:47.958 --> 00:08:49.958\n25 times faster than water.\n\n00:08:49.958 --> 00:08:52.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:08:52.958 --> 00:08:54.958\nAll right, well thanks for coming up.\n\n00:08:54.958 --> 00:08:55.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:08:55.958 --> 00:08:59.958\nZK: Wait, wait, Steven -- before you go we filled this with the dry liquid\n\n00:08:59.958 --> 00:09:00.958\nso during the break you can shoot your friends.\n\n00:09:00.958 --> 00:09:01.958\nSJ: Excellent, thank you.\n\n00:09:01.958 --> 00:09:03.958\nKS: Thanks for coming up. Let's give him a big round of applause.\n\n00:09:03.958 --> 00:09:06.958\n(Applause)\n\n00:09:06.958 --> 00:09:10.958\nSo what's the significance of this dry liquid?\n\n00:09:10.958 --> 00:09:14.958\nEarly versions of the fluid were actually used on a Cray Supercomputer.\n\n00:09:14.958 --> 00:09:17.958\nNow, the unexpected thing about this\n\n00:09:17.958 --> 00:09:19.958\nis that Zach could stand up on stage and drench\n\n00:09:19.958 --> 00:09:22.958\na perfectly innocent member of the audience without any concern\n\n00:09:22.958 --> 00:09:25.958\nthat we'd damage the electronics, that we'd get him wet,\n\n00:09:25.958 --> 00:09:29.958\nthat we'd hurt the books or the computers. It works because it's non-conductive.\n\n00:09:29.958 --> 00:09:31.958\nSo you can see here, you can immerse a whole circuit board\n\n00:09:31.958 --> 00:09:33.958\nin this and it wouldn't cause any damage.\n\n00:09:33.958 --> 00:09:35.958\nYou can circulate it to draw the heat away.\n\n00:09:35.958 --> 00:09:37.958\nBut today it's most widely used in office buildings --\n\n00:09:37.958 --> 00:09:40.958\nin the sprinkler system -- as a fire-suppression fluid.\n\n00:09:40.958 --> 00:09:44.958\nAgain, it's perfectly safe for people. It puts out the fires, doesn't hurt anything.\n\n00:09:44.958 --> 00:09:45.958\nBut our favorite idea for this\n\n00:09:45.958 --> 00:09:48.958\nwas using it in a basketball game. So during halftime,\n\n00:09:48.958 --> 00:09:50.958\nit could rain down on the players, cool everyone down,\n\n00:09:50.958 --> 00:09:54.958\nand in a matter of minutes it would dry. Wouldn't hurt the court.\n\n00:09:54.958 --> 00:09:56.958\nZK: Our next technology comes to us from a company in Japan\n\n00:09:56.958 --> 00:09:59.958\ncalled Sekisui Chemical. One of their R&amp;D engineers\n\n00:09:59.958 --> 00:10:02.958\nwas working on a way to make plastic stiffer.\n\n00:10:02.958 --> 00:10:05.958\nWhile he was doing this, he noticed an unexpected thing.\n\n00:10:05.958 --> 00:10:06.958\nWe have a video to show you.\n\n00:10:32.958 --> 00:10:34.958\nKS: So you see there, it didn't bounce back. Now, this was\n\n00:10:34.958 --> 00:10:37.958\nan unintended side effect of some experiments they were doing.\n\n00:10:37.958 --> 00:10:40.958\nIt's technically called, \"shape-retaining property.\"\n\n00:10:40.958 --> 00:10:43.958\nNow, think about your interactions with aluminum foil.\n\n00:10:43.958 --> 00:10:46.958\nShape-retaining is common in metal: you bend a piece of aluminum foil,\n\n00:10:46.958 --> 00:10:49.958\nand it holds its place. Contrast that with\n\n00:10:49.958 --> 00:10:51.958\na plastic garbage can -- and you can push in the sides\n\n00:10:51.958 --> 00:10:54.958\nand it always bounces back.\n\n00:10:54.958 --> 00:10:57.958\nZK: For example, you could make a watch that wraps around your wrist,\n\n00:10:57.958 --> 00:11:00.958\nbut doesn't use a buckle.\n\n00:11:00.958 --> 00:11:02.958\nTaking it a little further, if you wove\n\n00:11:02.958 --> 00:11:05.958\nthose strips together -- kind of like a little basket -- you could make\n\n00:11:05.958 --> 00:11:09.958\na shape-retaining sheet, and then you could embed it in a cloth:\n\n00:11:09.958 --> 00:11:11.958\nso you could make a picnic sheet that wraps around the table,\n\n00:11:11.958 --> 00:11:14.958\nso that way on a windy day it wouldn't blow away.\n\n00:11:14.958 --> 00:11:15.958\nFor our next technology, it's hard to observe\n\n00:11:15.958 --> 00:11:19.958\nthe unexpected property by itself, because it's an ink.\n\n00:11:19.958 --> 00:11:21.958\nSo, we've prepared a video to show it applied to paper.\n\n00:11:26.958 --> 00:11:30.958\nKS: As this paper is bending, the resistance of the ink changes.\n\n00:11:30.958 --> 00:11:34.958\nSo with simple electronics, you can detect how much the page is being bent.\n\n00:11:34.958 --> 00:11:36.958\nNow, to think about the potential for this,\n\n00:11:36.958 --> 00:11:39.958\nthink of all the places ink is supplied: on business cards,\n\n00:11:39.958 --> 00:11:43.958\non the back of cereal boxes, board games. Any place you use ink,\n\n00:11:43.958 --> 00:11:45.958\nyou could change the way you interact with it.\n\n00:11:45.958 --> 00:11:49.958\nZK: So my favorite idea for this is to apply the ink to a book.\n\n00:11:49.958 --> 00:11:52.958\nThis could totally change the way that you interface with paper.\n\n00:11:52.958 --> 00:11:55.958\nYou see the dark line on the side and the top. As you turn the pages\n\n00:11:55.958 --> 00:11:58.958\nof the book, the book can actually detect what page you're on,\n\n00:11:58.958 --> 00:12:00.958\nbased on the curvature of the pages.\n\n00:12:00.958 --> 00:12:04.958\nIn addition, if you were to fold in one of the corners, then you could program\n\n00:12:04.958 --> 00:12:09.958\nthe book to actually email you the text on the page for your notes.\n\n00:12:09.958 --> 00:12:11.958\nKS: For our last technology, we worked again with Roman and his team\n\n00:12:11.958 --> 00:12:14.958\nat the Directors Bureau to develop a commercial from the future\n\n00:12:14.958 --> 00:12:16.958\nto explain how it works.\n\n00:12:25.958 --> 00:12:27.958\nOld Milk Carton: Oh yeah, it smells good.\n\n00:12:32.958 --> 00:12:34.958\nWho are you?\n\n00:12:34.958 --> 00:12:37.958\nNew Milk Carton: I'm New Milk.\n\n00:12:37.958 --> 00:12:39.958\nOMC: I used to smell like you.\n\n00:12:39.958 --> 00:12:41.958\nNarrator: Fresh Watch, from Inventables Dairy Farms.\n\n00:12:41.958 --> 00:12:44.958\nPackaging that changes color when your milk's gone off.\n\n00:12:44.958 --> 00:12:47.958\nDon't let milk spoil your morning.\n\n00:12:47.958 --> 00:12:50.958\nZK: Now, this technology was developed by these two guys:\n\n00:12:50.958 --> 00:12:53.958\nProfessor Ken Suslick and Neil Rakow, of the University of Illinois.\n\n00:12:53.958 --> 00:12:56.958\nKS: Now the way it works: there's a matrix of color dyes.\n\n00:12:56.958 --> 00:12:59.958\nAnd these dyes change color in response to odors.\n\n00:12:59.958 --> 00:13:03.958\nSo the smell of vanilla, that might change the four on the left to brown\n\n00:13:03.958 --> 00:13:06.958\nand the one on the right to yellow. This matrix can produce\n\n00:13:06.958 --> 00:13:10.958\nthousands of different color combinations to represent thousands of different smells.\n\n00:13:10.958 --> 00:13:13.958\nBut like in the milk commercial, if you know what odor you want to detect,\n\n00:13:13.958 --> 00:13:16.958\nthen they can formulate a specific dye to detect just that odor.\n\n00:13:16.958 --> 00:13:20.958\nZK: Right. It was that that started a conversation with Professor Suslick and myself,\n\n00:13:20.958 --> 00:13:23.958\nand he was explaining to me the things that this is making possible,\n\n00:13:23.958 --> 00:13:28.958\nbeyond just detecting spoiled food. It's really where the significance of it lies.\n\n00:13:28.958 --> 00:13:32.958\nHis company actually did a survey of firemen all across the country to try to learn,\n\n00:13:32.958 --> 00:13:36.958\nhow are they currently testing the air when they respond to an emergency scene?\n\n00:13:36.958 --> 00:13:39.958\nAnd he kind of comically explained that\n\n00:13:39.958 --> 00:13:41.958\ntime after time, what the firemen would say is:\n\n00:13:41.958 --> 00:13:44.958\nthey would rush to the scene of the crime; they would look around;\n\n00:13:44.958 --> 00:13:46.958\nif there were no dead policemen, it was OK to go.\n\n00:13:46.958 --> 00:13:49.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:13:49.958 --> 00:13:53.958\nI mean, this is a true story. They're using policemen as canaries.\n\n00:13:53.958 --> 00:13:55.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:13:55.958 --> 00:13:57.958\nBut more seriously, they determined that you could develop\n\n00:13:57.958 --> 00:14:00.958\na device that can smell better than the humans,\n\n00:14:00.958 --> 00:14:03.958\nand say if it's safe for the firemen.\n\n00:14:03.958 --> 00:14:07.958\nIn addition, he's spun off a company from the University called ChemSensing,\n\n00:14:07.958 --> 00:14:10.958\nwhere they're working on medical equipment.\n\n00:14:10.958 --> 00:14:13.958\nSo, a patient can come in and actually blow into their device.\n\n00:14:13.958 --> 00:14:17.958\nBy detecting the odor of particular bacteria, or viruses,\n\n00:14:17.958 --> 00:14:20.958\nor even lung cancer, the dots will change and they can use\n\n00:14:20.958 --> 00:14:23.958\nsoftware to analyze the results.\n\n00:14:23.958 --> 00:14:27.958\nThis can radically improve the way that doctors diagnose patients.\n\n00:14:27.958 --> 00:14:29.958\nCurrently, they're using a method of trial and error,\n\n00:14:29.958 --> 00:14:32.958\nbut this could tell you precisely what disease you have.\n\n00:14:32.958 --> 00:14:35.958\nKS: So that was the six we had for you today, but I hope you're starting to see\n\n00:14:35.958 --> 00:14:37.958\nwhy we find these things so fascinating.\n\n00:14:37.958 --> 00:14:40.958\nBecause every one of these six changed our understanding\n\n00:14:40.958 --> 00:14:43.958\nof what was possible in the world. Prior to seeing this,\n\n00:14:43.958 --> 00:14:46.958\nwe would have assumed: a 10-foot pole couldn't fit in your pocket;\n\n00:14:46.958 --> 00:14:49.958\nsomething as inexpensive as ink couldn't sense the way paper is being bent;\n\n00:14:49.958 --> 00:14:53.958\nevery one of these things -- and we're constantly trying to find more.\n\n00:14:53.958 --> 00:14:55.958\nZK: This is something that Keith and I really enjoy doing.\n\n00:14:55.958 --> 00:14:59.958\nI'm sure it's obvious to you now, but it was actually yesterday\n\n00:14:59.958 --> 00:15:01.958\nthat I was reminded of why. I was having a conversation\n\n00:15:01.958 --> 00:15:05.958\nwith Steve Jurvetson, over downstairs by the escalators,\n\n00:15:05.958 --> 00:15:08.958\nand he was telling me that when Chris sent out that little box,\n\n00:15:08.958 --> 00:15:10.958\none of the items in it was the hydrophobic sand --\n\n00:15:10.958 --> 00:15:14.958\nthe sand that doesn't get wet. He said that he was playing with it with his son.\n\n00:15:14.958 --> 00:15:16.958\nAnd you know, his son was mesmerized,\n\n00:15:16.958 --> 00:15:18.958\nbecause he would dunk it in the water, he would take it out\n\n00:15:18.958 --> 00:15:21.958\nand it was bone dry. A few weeks later, he said that his son\n\n00:15:21.958 --> 00:15:24.958\nwas playing with a lock of his mother's hair, and he noticed\n\n00:15:24.958 --> 00:15:26.958\nthat there were some drops of water on the hair.\n\n00:15:26.958 --> 00:15:28.958\nAnd he took the thing and he looked up to Steve and he said,\n\n00:15:28.958 --> 00:15:30.958\n\"Look, hydrophobic string.\"\n\n00:15:30.958 --> 00:15:33.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:15:33.958 --> 00:15:36.958\nI mean, after hearing that story -- that really summed it up for me.\n\n00:15:36.958 --> 00:15:37.958\nThank you very much.\n\n00:15:37.958 --> 00:15:38.958\nKS: Thank you.\n\n00:15:38.958 --> 00:15:40.958\n(Applause)"}, {"title": "The story of Ezra", "duration": "1124", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/newton_aduaka_tells_the_story_of_ezra", "transcript": "This is very strange for me, because I\u2019m not used to doing this: I usually stand on the other side of the light, and now I'm feeling the pressure I put other people into. And it's hard ... The previous speaker has, I think, really painted a very good background as to the impulse behind my work and what drives me, and my sense of loss, and trying to find the answer to the big questions.But this, for me, I mean, coming here to do this, feels like \u2014 there\u2019s this sculptor that I like very much, Giacometti, who after many years of living in France \u2014 and learning, you know, studying and working \u2014 he returned home and he was asked, what did you produce? What have you done with so many years of being away? And he sort of, he showed a handful of figurines. And obviously they were, \"Is this what you spent years doing? And we expected huge masterpieces!\" But what struck me is the understanding that in those little pieces was the culmination of a man\u2019s life, search, thought, everything \u2014 just in a reduced, small version. In a way, I feel like that. I feel like I\u2019m coming home to talk about what I\u2019ve been away doing for 20 years. And I will start with a brief taster of what I\u2019ve been about: a handful of films \u2014 nothing much, two feature films and a handful of short films. So, we\u2019ll go with the first piece.(Video) Woman: \"I destroy lives,\" mum said. I love her, you know. She\u2019s not even my real mum. My real mum and dad dumped me and fucked off back to Nigeria. The devil is in me, Court. Court: Sleep. Woman: Have you ever been? Court: Where? Woman: Nigeria. Court: Never. My mum wanted to, couldn\u2019t afford it. Woman: Wish I could. I have this feeling I\u2019d be happy there. Why does everyone get rid of me? Court: I don't want to get rid of you. Woman: You don't need me. You\u2019re just too blind to see it now.Boy: What do you do all day? Marcus: Read. Boy: Don't you get bored? And how come you ain't got a job anyway? Marcus: I am retired. Boy: So? Marcus: So I've done my bit for Queen and country, now I work for myself. Boy: No, now you sit around like a bum all day. Marcus: Because I do what I like? Boy: Look man, reading don't feed no one. And it particularly don't feed your spliff habit. Marcus: It feeds my mind and my soul. Boy: Arguing with you is a waste of time, Marcus. Marcus: You\u2019re a rapper, am I right? Boy: Yeah. Marcus: A modern day poet. Boy: Yeah, you could say that. Marcus: So what do you talk about? Boy: What's that supposed to mean? Marcus: Simple. What do you rap about? Boy: Reality, man. Marcus: Whose reality? Boy: My fuckin' reality. Marcus: Tell me about your reality. Boy: Racism, oppression, people like me not getting a break in life. Marcus: So what solutions do you offer? I mean, the job of a poet is not just \u2014 Boy: Man, fight the power! Simple: blow the motherfuckers out of the sky. Marcus: With an AK-47? Boy: Man, if I had one, too fuckin' right. Marcus: And how many soldiers have you recruited to fight this war with you? Boy: Oh, Marcus, you know what I mean. Marcus: When a man resorts to profanities, it\u2019s a sure sign of his inability to express himself. Boy: See man, you\u2019re just taking the piss out of me now. Marcus: The Panthers. Boy: Panthers? Ass kickin' guys who were fed up with all that white supremacist, powers-that-be bullshit, and just went in there and kicked everybody's arse. Fuckin\u2019 wicked, man. I saw the movie. Bad! What?Director 1: I saw his last film. \u00c9puise, right? Woman 1: Yes. D1: Not to make a bad joke, but it was really \u00e9puis\u00e9. Epuis\u00e9 \u2014 tired, exhausted, fed up. Director 2: Can you not shut up? Now, you talk straight to me, what\u2019s wrong with my films? Let\u2019s go. W1: They suck. Woman 2: They suck? What about yours? What, what, what, what about, what? What do you think about your movie? D1: My movies, they are OK, fine. They are better than making documentaries no one ever sees. What the fuck are you talking about? Did you ever move your fuckin' ass from Hollywood to go and film something real? You make people fuckin' sleep. Dream about bullshit.(Applause)Newton Aduaka: Thank you. The first clip, really, is totally trying to capture what cinema is for me, and where I'm coming from in terms of cinema. The first piece was, really, there's a young woman talking about Nigeria, that she has a feeling she'll be happy there. These are the sentiments of someone that's been away from home. And that was something that I went through, you know, and I'm still going through. I've not been home for quite a while, for about five years now. I've been away 20 years in total. And so it\u2019s really \u2014 it's really how suddenly, you know, this was made in 1997, which is the time of Abacha \u2014 the military dictatorship, the worst part of Nigerian history, this post-colonial history. So, for this girl to have these dreams is simply how we preserve a sense of what home is. How \u2014 and it's sort of, perhaps romantic, but I think beautiful, because you just need something to hold on to, especially in a society where you feel alienated.Which takes us to the next piece, where the young man talks about lack of opportunity: living as a black person in Europe, the glass ceiling that we all know about, that we all talk about, and his reality. Again, this was my \u2014 this was me talking about \u2014 this was, again, the time of multiculturalism in the United Kingdom, and there was this buzzword \u2014 and it was trying to say, what exactly does this multiculturalism mean in the real lives of people? And what would a child \u2014 what does a child like Jamie \u2014 the young boy \u2014 think, I mean, with all this anger that's built up inside of him? What happens with that? What, of course, happens with that is violence, which we see when we talk about the ghettos and we talk about, you know, South Central L.A. and this kind of stuff, and which eventually, when channeled, becomes, you know, evolves and manifests itself as riots \u2014 like the one in France two years ago, where I live, which shocked everybody, because everyone thought, \"Oh well, France is a liberal society.\" But I lived in England for 18 years. I've lived in France for about four, and I feel actually thrown back 20 years, living in France. And then, the third piece. The third piece for me is the question: What is cinema to you? What do you do with cinema? There's a young director, Hollywood director, with his friends \u2014 fellow filmmakers \u2014 talking about what cinema means. I suppose that will take me to my last piece \u2014 what cinema means for me. My life started as a \u2014 I started life in 1966, a few months before the Biafran, which lasted for three years and it was three years of war. So that whole thing, that whole childhood echoes and takes me into the next piece.(Video) Voice: Onicha, off to school with your brother. Onicha: Yes, mama. Commander: Soldiers, you are going to fight a battle, so you must get ready and willing to die. You must get \u2014 ? Child Soldiers: Ready and willing to die. C: Success, the change is only coming through the barrel of the gun. CS: The barrel of the gun! C: This is the gun. CS: This is the gun. C: This is an AK-47 rifle. This is your life. This is your life. This is ... this is ... this is your life. Ezra: They give us the special drugs. We call it bubbles. Amphetamines. Soldiers: Rain come, sun come, soldier man dey go. I say rain come, sun come, soldier man dey go. We went from one village to another \u2014 three villages. I don\u2019t remember how we got there. Witness: We walked and walked for two days. We didn't eat. There was no food, just little rice. Without food \u2014 I was sick. The injection made us not to have mind. God will forgive us. He knows we did not know. We did not know!Committee Chairman: Do you remember January 6th, 1999? Ezra: I don\u2019t remember.Various Voices: You will die! You will die! (Screaming) Onicha: Ezra! (Ezra: Onicha! Onicha!) Various Voices: \u266b We don't need no more trouble \u266b \u266b No more trouble \u266b They killed my mother. The Mende sons of bastards. (Shouting) Who is she? Me. Why you giving these to me? So you can stop staring at me. My story is a little bit complicated. I\u2019m interested. Mariam is pregnant. You know what you are? A crocodile. Big mouth. Short legs. In front of Rufus you are Ezra the coward. He\u2019s not taking care of his troops. Troop, pay your last honor. Salute. Open your eyes, Ezra. A blind man can see that the diamonds end up in his pocket. \u266b We don't need no more trouble \u266b Get that idiot out! I take you are preparing a major attack? This must be the mine. Your girl is here. Well done, well done. That is what you are here for, no? You are planning to go back to fight are you? \u266b We don't need no more trouble \u266b \u266b No more trouble \u266b \u266b We don't need no more trouble \u266b \u266b No more trouble. \u266b Wake up! Everybody wake up. Road block! \u266b We don't need no more ... \u266bCommittee Chairman: We hope that, with your help and the help of others, that this commission will go a long way towards understanding the causes of the rebel war. More than that, begin a healing process and finally to \u2014 as an act of closure to a terrible period in this country\u2019s history. The beginning of hope. Mr. Ezra Gelehun, please stand. State your name and age for the commission. Ezra: My name is Ezra Gelehun. I am 15 or 16. I don\u2019t remember. Ask my sister, she is the witch, she knows everything. (Sister: 16.) CC: Mr. Gelehun, I\u2019d like to remind you you\u2019re not on trial here for any crimes you committed. E: We were fighting for our freedom. If killing in a war is a crime, then you have to charge every soldier in the world. War is a crime, yes, but I did not start it. You too are a retired General, not so? CC: Yes, correct. E: So you too must stand trial then. Our government was corrupt. Lack of education was their way to control power. If I may ask, do you pay for school in your country? CC: No, we don\u2019t. E: You are richer than us. But we pay for school. Your country talks about democracy, but you support corrupt governments like my own. Why? Because you want our diamond. Ask if anyone in this room have ever seen real diamond before? No. CC: Mr. Gelehun, I'd like to remind you, you're not on trial here today. You are not on trial. E: Then let me go. CC: I can't do that, son. E: So you are a liar.(Applause)NA: Thank you. Just very quickly to say that my point really here, is that while we\u2019re making all these huge advancements, what we're doing, which for me, you know, I think we should \u2014 Africa should move forward, but we should remember, so we do not go back here again. Thank you.Emeka Okafor: Thank you, Newton.(Applause)One of the themes that comes through very strongly in the piece we just watched is this sense of the psychological trauma of the young that have to play this role of being child soldiers. And considering where you are coming from, and when we consider the extent to which it\u2019s not taken as seriously as it should be, what would you have to say about that?NA: In the process of my research, I actually spent a bit of time in Sierra Leone researching this. And I remember I met a lot of child soldiers \u2014 ex-combatants, as they like to be called. I met psychosocial workers who worked with them. I met psychiatrists who spent time with them, aid workers, NGOs, the whole lot. But I remember on the flight back on my last trip, I remember breaking down in tears and thinking to myself, if any kid in the West, in the western world, went through a day of what any of those kids have gone through, they will be in therapy for the rest of their natural lives. So for me, the thought that we have all these children \u2014 it\u2019s a generation, we have a whole generation of children \u2014 who have been put through so much psychological trauma or damage, and Africa has to live with that. But I\u2019m just saying to factor that in, factor that in with all this great advancement, all this pronouncement of great achievement. That\u2019s really my thinking.EO: Well, we thank you again for coming to the TED stage.

I love the way he sits and lies on his kennel and contemplates the great things of life. So when I thought about compassion, my mind immediately went to one of the cartoon strips, where he's lying there and he says, \"I really understand, and I really appreciate how one should love one's neighbor as one love's oneself. The only trouble is the people next door; I can't stand them.\" This, in a way, is one of the challenges of how to interpret a really good idea.We all, I think, believe in compassion. If you look at all the world religions, all the main world religions, you'll find within them some teaching concerning compassion. So in Judaism, we have, from our Torah, that you should love your neighbor as you love yourself. And within Jewish teachings, the rabbinic teachings, we have Hillel, who taught that you shouldn't do to others what you don't like being done to yourself. And all the main religions have similar teachings. And again, within Judaism, we have a teaching about God, who is called the compassionate one, Ha-rachaman. After all, how could the world exist without God being compassionate? And we, as taught within the Torah that we are made in the image of God, so we too have to be compassionate. But what does it mean? How does it impact on our everyday life? Sometimes, of course, being compassionate can produce feelings within us that are very difficult to control.I know there are many times when I've gone and conducted a funeral, or when I have been sitting with the bereaved, or with people who are dying, and I am overwhelmed by the sadness, by the difficulty, the challenge that is there for the family, for the person. And I'm touched, so that tears come to my eyes. And yet, if I just allowed myself to be overwhelmed by these feelings, I wouldn't be doing my job \u2014 because I have to actually be there for them and make sure that rituals happen, that practicalities are seen to. And yet, on the other hand, if I didn't feel this compassion, then I feel that it would be time for me to hang up my robe and give up being a rabbi.And these same feelings are there for all of us as we face the world. Who cannot be touched by compassion when we see the terrible horrors of the results of war, or famine, or earthquakes, or tsunamis? I know some people who say \"Well, you know there's just so much out there \u2014 I can't do anything, I'm not going to even begin to try.\" And there are some charity workers who call this compassion fatigue. There are others who feel they can't confront compassion anymore, and so they turn off the television and don't watch. In Judaism, though, we tend to always say, there has to be a middle way.You have to, of course, be aware of the needs of others, but you have to be aware in such a way that you can carry on with your life and be of help to people. So part of compassion has to be an understanding of what makes people tick. And, of course, you can't do that unless you understand yourself a bit more.And there's a lovely rabbinic interpretation of the beginnings of creation, which says that when God created the world, God thought that it would be best to create the world only with the divine attribute of justice. Because, after all, God is just. Therefore, there should be justice throughout the world. And then God looked to the future and realized, if the world was created just with justice, the world couldn't exist.So, God thought, \"Nope, I'm going to create the world just with compassion.\" And then God looked to the future and realized that, in fact, if the world were just filled with compassion, there would be anarchy and chaos. There had to be limits to all things. The rabbis describe this as being like a king who has a beautiful, fragile glass bowl. If you put too much cold water in, it will shatter. If you put boiling water in, it will shatter. What do you have to do? Put in a mixture of the two. And so God put both of these possibilities into the world.There is something more though that has to be there. And that is the translation of the feelings that we may have about compassion into the wider world, into action. So, like Snoopy, we can't just lie there and think great thoughts about our neighbors. We actually have to do something about it. And so there is also, within Judaism, this notion of love and kindness that becomes very important: \"chesed.\"All these three things, then, have to be melded together. The idea of justice, which gives boundaries to our lives and gives us a feeling of what's right about life, what's right about living, what should we be doing, social justice. There has to be a willingness to do good deeds, but not, of course, at the expense of our own sanity. You know, there's no way that you can do anything for anyone if you overdo things. And balancing them all in the middle is this notion of compassion, which has to be there, if you like, at our very roots.This idea of compassion comes to us because we're made in the image of God, who is ultimately the compassionate one. What does this compassion entail? It entails understanding the pain of the other. But even more than that, it means understanding one's connection to the whole of creation: understanding that one is part of that creation, that there is a unity that underlies all that we see, all that we hear, all that we feel. I call that unity God. And that unity is something that connects all of creation.And, of course, in the modern world, with the environmental movement, we're becoming even more aware of the connectivity of things, that something I do here actually does matter in Africa, that if I use too much of my carbon allowance, it seems to be that we are causing a great lack of rain in central and eastern Africa. So there is a connectivity, and I have to understand that \u2014 as part of the creation, as part of me being made in the image of God. And I have to understand that my needs sometimes have to be sublimated to other needs.This \"18 minutes\" business, I find quite fascinating. Because in Judaism, the number 18, in Hebrew letters, stands for life \u2014 the word \"life.\" So, in a sense, the 18 minutes is challenging me to say, \"In life, this is what's important in terms of compassion.\" But, something else as well: actually, 18 minutes is important. Because at Passover, when we have to eat unleavened bread, the rabbis say, what is the difference between dough that is made into bread, and dough that is made into unleavened bread, or \"matzah\"? And they say \"It's 18 minutes.\" Because that's how long they say it takes for this dough to become leaven. What does it mean, \"dough becomes leaven\"? It means it gets filled with hot air. What's matzah? What's unleavened bread? You don't get it.Symbolically, what the rabbis say is that at Passover, what we have to do is try to get rid of our hot air \u2014 our pride, our feeling that we are the most important people in the whole entire world, and that everything should revolve round us. So we try and get rid of those, and so doing, try to get rid of the habits, the emotions, the ideas that enslave us, that make our eyes closed, give us tunnel vision so we don't see the needs of others \u2014 and free ourselves and free ourselves from that. And that too is a basis for having compassion, for understanding our place in the world.Now there is, in Judaism, a gorgeous story of a rich man who sat in synagogue one day. And, as many people do, he was dozing off during the sermon. And as he was dozing off, they were reading from the book of Leviticus in the Torah. And they were saying that in the ancient times in the temple in Jerusalem, the priests used to have bread, which they used to place into a special table in the temple in Jerusalem. The man was asleep, but he heard the words bread, temple, God, and he woke up. He said, \"God wants bread. That's it. God wants bread. I know what God wants.\"And he rushed home. And after the Sabbath, he made 12 loaves of bread, took them to the synagogue, went into the synagogue, opened the ark and said, \"God, I don't know why you want this bread, but here you are.\" And he put it in the ark with the scrolls of the Torah. Then he went home.The cleaner came into the synagogue. \"Oh God, I'm in such trouble. I've got children to feed. My wife's ill. I've got no money. What can I do?\" He goes into the synagogue. \"God, will you please help me? Ah, what a wonderful smell.\" He goes to the ark. He opens the ark. \"There's bread! God, you've answered my plea. You've answered my question.\" Takes the bread and goes home.Meanwhile, the rich man thinks to himself, \"I'm an idiot. God wants bread? God, the one who rules the entire universe, wants my bread?\" He rushes to the synagogue. \"I'll get it out of the ark before anybody finds it.\" He goes in there, and it's not there. And he says, \"God, you really did want it. You wanted my bread. Next week, with raisins.\"This went on for years. Every week, the man would bring bread with raisins, with all sorts of good things, put it into the ark. Every week, the cleaner would come. \"God you've answered my plea again.\" Take the bread. Take it home.Went on until a new rabbi came. Rabbis always spoil things. The rabbi came in and saw what was going on. And he called the two of them to his office. And he said, you know, \"This is what's happening.\"And the rich man \u2014 oh, dear \u2014 crestfallen. \"You mean God didn't want my bread?\"And the poor man said, \"And you mean God didn't answer my pleas?\"And the rabbi said, \"You've misunderstood me. You've misunderstood totally,\" he said. \"Of course, what you are doing,\" he said to the rich man, \"is answering God's plea that we should be compassionate. And God,\" he said to the poor man, \"is answering your plea that people should be compassionate and give.\" He looked at the rich man. He held the rich man's hands and said, \"Don't you understand?\" He said, \"These are the hands of God.\"So that is the way I feel: that I can only try to approach this notion of being compassionate, of understanding that there is a connectivity, that there is a unity in this world; that I want to try and serve that unity, and that I can try and do that by understanding, I hope, trying to understand something of the pain of others; but understanding that there are limits, that people have to bear responsibility for some of the problems that come upon them; and that I have to understand that there are limits to my energy, to the giving I can give. I have to reevaluate them, try and separate out the material things and my emotions that may be enslaving me, so that I can see the world clearly.And then I have to try to see in what ways I can make these the hands of God. And so try to bring compassion to life in this world.", "id": 673, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:12.958 --> 00:00:17.958\nOne of my favorite cartoon characters is Snoopy.\n\n00:00:17.958 --> 00:00:24.958\nI love the way he sits and lies on his kennel and contemplates the great things of life.\n\n00:00:24.958 --> 00:00:26.958\nSo when I thought about compassion,\n\n00:00:26.958 --> 00:00:30.958\nmy mind immediately went to one of the cartoon strips,\n\n00:00:30.958 --> 00:00:34.958\nwhere he's lying there and he says,\n\n00:00:34.958 --> 00:00:37.958\n\"I really understand, and I really appreciate\n\n00:00:37.958 --> 00:00:42.958\nhow one should love one's neighbor as one love's oneself.\n\n00:00:42.958 --> 00:00:47.958\nThe only trouble is the people next door; I can't stand them.\"\n\n00:00:47.958 --> 00:00:52.958\nThis, in a way, is one of the challenges\n\n00:00:52.958 --> 00:00:56.958\nof how to interpret a really good idea.\n\n00:00:56.958 --> 00:00:59.958\nWe all, I think, believe in compassion.\n\n00:00:59.958 --> 00:01:03.958\nIf you look at all the world religions, all the main world religions,\n\n00:01:03.958 --> 00:01:08.958\nyou'll find within them some teaching concerning compassion.\n\n00:01:08.958 --> 00:01:11.958\nSo in Judaism, we have, from our Torah,\n\n00:01:11.958 --> 00:01:15.958\nthat you should love your neighbor as you love yourself.\n\n00:01:15.958 --> 00:01:20.958\nAnd within Jewish teachings, the rabbinic teachings, we have Hillel,\n\n00:01:20.958 --> 00:01:25.958\nwho taught that you shouldn't do to others what you don't like being done to yourself.\n\n00:01:25.958 --> 00:01:30.958\nAnd all the main religions have similar teachings.\n\n00:01:30.958 --> 00:01:32.958\nAnd again, within Judaism,\n\n00:01:32.958 --> 00:01:35.958\nwe have a teaching about God,\n\n00:01:35.958 --> 00:01:38.958\nwho is called the compassionate one, Ha-rachaman.\n\n00:01:38.958 --> 00:01:43.958\nAfter all, how could the world exist without God being compassionate?\n\n00:01:43.958 --> 00:01:48.958\nAnd we, as taught within the Torah that we are made in the image of God,\n\n00:01:48.958 --> 00:01:52.958\nso we too have to be compassionate.\n\n00:01:52.958 --> 00:01:56.958\nBut what does it mean? How does it impact on our everyday life?\n\n00:01:56.958 --> 00:02:00.958\nSometimes, of course, being compassionate\n\n00:02:00.958 --> 00:02:07.958\ncan produce feelings within us that are very difficult to control.\n\n00:02:07.958 --> 00:02:13.958\nI know there are many times when I've gone and conducted a funeral,\n\n00:02:13.958 --> 00:02:19.958\nor when I have been sitting with the bereaved, or with people who are dying,\n\n00:02:19.958 --> 00:02:28.958\nand I am overwhelmed by the sadness, by the difficulty,\n\n00:02:28.958 --> 00:02:32.958\nthe challenge that is there for the family, for the person.\n\n00:02:32.958 --> 00:02:37.958\nAnd I'm touched, so that tears come to my eyes.\n\n00:02:37.958 --> 00:02:42.958\nAnd yet, if I just allowed myself to be overwhelmed by these feelings,\n\n00:02:42.958 --> 00:02:45.958\nI wouldn't be doing my job --\n\n00:02:45.958 --> 00:02:47.958\nbecause I have to actually be there for them\n\n00:02:47.958 --> 00:02:55.958\nand make sure that rituals happen, that practicalities are seen to.\n\n00:02:55.958 --> 00:03:00.958\nAnd yet, on the other hand, if I didn't feel this compassion,\n\n00:03:00.958 --> 00:03:05.958\nthen I feel that it would be time for me to hang up my robe\n\n00:03:05.958 --> 00:03:08.958\nand give up being a rabbi.\n\n00:03:08.958 --> 00:03:13.958\nAnd these same feelings are there for all of us as we face the world.\n\n00:03:13.958 --> 00:03:17.958\nWho cannot be touched by compassion\n\n00:03:17.958 --> 00:03:24.958\nwhen we see the terrible horrors of the results of war,\n\n00:03:24.958 --> 00:03:29.958\nor famine, or earthquakes, or tsunamis?\n\n00:03:29.958 --> 00:03:31.958\nI know some people who say\n\n00:03:31.958 --> 00:03:35.958\n\"Well, you know there's just so much out there -- I can't do anything,\n\n00:03:35.958 --> 00:03:39.958\nI'm not going to even begin to try.\"\n\n00:03:39.958 --> 00:03:45.958\nAnd there are some charity workers who call this compassion fatigue.\n\n00:03:45.958 --> 00:03:52.958\nThere are others who feel they can't confront compassion anymore,\n\n00:03:52.958 --> 00:03:57.958\nand so they turn off the television and don't watch.\n\n00:03:57.958 --> 00:04:04.958\nIn Judaism, though, we tend to always say, there has to be a middle way.\n\n00:04:04.958 --> 00:04:11.958\nYou have to, of course, be aware of the needs of others,\n\n00:04:11.958 --> 00:04:16.958\nbut you have to be aware in such a way that you can carry on with your life\n\n00:04:16.958 --> 00:04:19.958\nand be of help to people.\n\n00:04:19.958 --> 00:04:28.958\nSo part of compassion has to be an understanding of what makes people tick.\n\n00:04:28.958 --> 00:04:31.958\nAnd, of course, you can't do that unless you understand yourself a bit more.\n\n00:04:31.958 --> 00:04:38.958\nAnd there's a lovely rabbinic interpretation of the beginnings of creation,\n\n00:04:38.958 --> 00:04:42.958\nwhich says that when God created the world,\n\n00:04:42.958 --> 00:04:48.958\nGod thought that it would be best to create the world\n\n00:04:48.958 --> 00:04:52.958\nonly with the divine attribute of justice.\n\n00:04:52.958 --> 00:04:54.958\nBecause, after all, God is just.\n\n00:04:54.958 --> 00:04:59.958\nTherefore, there should be justice throughout the world.\n\n00:04:59.958 --> 00:05:01.958\nAnd then God looked to the future and realized,\n\n00:05:01.958 --> 00:05:06.958\nif the world was created just with justice, the world couldn't exist.\n\n00:05:06.958 --> 00:05:12.958\nSo, God thought, \"Nope, I'm going to create the world just with compassion.\"\n\n00:05:12.958 --> 00:05:16.958\nAnd then God looked to the future and realized that,\n\n00:05:16.958 --> 00:05:20.958\nin fact, if the world were just filled with compassion,\n\n00:05:20.958 --> 00:05:24.958\nthere would be anarchy and chaos.\n\n00:05:24.958 --> 00:05:27.958\nThere had to be limits to all things.\n\n00:05:27.958 --> 00:05:32.958\nThe rabbis describe this as being like a king\n\n00:05:32.958 --> 00:05:38.958\nwho has a beautiful, fragile glass bowl.\n\n00:05:38.958 --> 00:05:42.958\nIf you put too much cold water in, it will shatter.\n\n00:05:42.958 --> 00:05:44.958\nIf you put boiling water in, it will shatter.\n\n00:05:44.958 --> 00:05:49.958\nWhat do you have to do? Put in a mixture of the two.\n\n00:05:49.958 --> 00:05:57.958\nAnd so God put both of these possibilities into the world.\n\n00:05:57.958 --> 00:06:01.958\nThere is something more though that has to be there.\n\n00:06:01.958 --> 00:06:06.958\nAnd that is the translation of the feelings\n\n00:06:06.958 --> 00:06:09.958\nthat we may have about compassion\n\n00:06:09.958 --> 00:06:13.958\ninto the wider world, into action.\n\n00:06:13.958 --> 00:06:16.958\nSo, like Snoopy, we can't just lie there\n\n00:06:16.958 --> 00:06:19.958\nand think great thoughts about our neighbors.\n\n00:06:19.958 --> 00:06:22.958\nWe actually have to do something about it.\n\n00:06:22.958 --> 00:06:27.958\nAnd so there is also, within Judaism, this notion of love and kindness\n\n00:06:27.958 --> 00:06:32.958\nthat becomes very important: \"chesed.\"\n\n00:06:32.958 --> 00:06:37.958\nAll these three things, then, have to be melded together.\n\n00:06:37.958 --> 00:06:43.958\nThe idea of justice, which gives boundaries to our lives\n\n00:06:43.958 --> 00:06:50.958\nand gives us a feeling of what's right about life, what's right about living,\n\n00:06:50.958 --> 00:06:54.958\nwhat should we be doing, social justice.\n\n00:06:54.958 --> 00:06:59.958\nThere has to be a willingness to do good deeds,\n\n00:06:59.958 --> 00:07:03.958\nbut not, of course, at the expense of our own sanity.\n\n00:07:03.958 --> 00:07:06.958\nYou know, there's no way that you can do anything for anyone\n\n00:07:06.958 --> 00:07:08.958\nif you overdo things.\n\n00:07:08.958 --> 00:07:14.958\nAnd balancing them all in the middle is this notion of compassion,\n\n00:07:14.958 --> 00:07:20.958\nwhich has to be there, if you like, at our very roots.\n\n00:07:20.958 --> 00:07:25.958\nThis idea of compassion comes to us\n\n00:07:25.958 --> 00:07:28.958\nbecause we're made in the image of God,\n\n00:07:28.958 --> 00:07:32.958\nwho is ultimately the compassionate one.\n\n00:07:32.958 --> 00:07:34.958\nWhat does this compassion entail?\n\n00:07:34.958 --> 00:07:39.958\nIt entails understanding the pain of the other.\n\n00:07:39.958 --> 00:07:41.958\nBut even more than that,\n\n00:07:41.958 --> 00:07:49.958\nit means understanding one's connection to the whole of creation:\n\n00:07:49.958 --> 00:07:53.958\nunderstanding that one is part of that creation,\n\n00:07:53.958 --> 00:07:57.958\nthat there is a unity that underlies all that we see,\n\n00:07:57.958 --> 00:08:01.958\nall that we hear, all that we feel.\n\n00:08:01.958 --> 00:08:04.958\nI call that unity God.\n\n00:08:04.958 --> 00:08:09.958\nAnd that unity is something that connects all of creation.\n\n00:08:09.958 --> 00:08:12.958\nAnd, of course, in the modern world, with the environmental movement,\n\n00:08:12.958 --> 00:08:17.958\nwe're becoming even more aware of the connectivity of things,\n\n00:08:17.958 --> 00:08:22.958\nthat something I do here actually does matter in Africa,\n\n00:08:22.958 --> 00:08:26.958\nthat if I use too much of my carbon allowance,\n\n00:08:26.958 --> 00:08:28.958\nit seems to be that we are causing\n\n00:08:28.958 --> 00:08:35.958\na great lack of rain in central and eastern Africa.\n\n00:08:35.958 --> 00:08:37.958\nSo there is a connectivity,\n\n00:08:37.958 --> 00:08:43.958\nand I have to understand that -- as part of the creation,\n\n00:08:43.958 --> 00:08:48.958\nas part of me being made in the image of God.\n\n00:08:48.958 --> 00:08:52.958\nAnd I have to understand that my needs\n\n00:08:52.958 --> 00:08:56.958\nsometimes have to be sublimated to other needs.\n\n00:08:56.958 --> 00:09:01.958\nThis \"18 minutes\" business, I find quite fascinating.\n\n00:09:01.958 --> 00:09:06.958\nBecause in Judaism, the number 18, in Hebrew letters,\n\n00:09:06.958 --> 00:09:09.958\nstands for life -- the word \"life.\"\n\n00:09:09.958 --> 00:09:14.958\nSo, in a sense, the 18 minutes is challenging me to say,\n\n00:09:14.958 --> 00:09:18.958\n\"In life, this is what's important in terms of compassion.\"\n\n00:09:18.958 --> 00:09:20.958\nBut, something else as well:\n\n00:09:20.958 --> 00:09:23.958\nactually, 18 minutes is important.\n\n00:09:23.958 --> 00:09:29.958\nBecause at Passover, when we have to eat unleavened bread,\n\n00:09:29.958 --> 00:09:33.958\nthe rabbis say, what is the difference between dough that is made into bread,\n\n00:09:33.958 --> 00:09:36.958\nand dough that is made into unleavened bread, or \"matzah\"?\n\n00:09:36.958 --> 00:09:39.958\nAnd they say \"It's 18 minutes.\"\n\n00:09:39.958 --> 00:09:44.958\nBecause that's how long they say it takes for this dough to become leaven.\n\n00:09:44.958 --> 00:09:47.958\nWhat does it mean, \"dough becomes leaven\"?\n\n00:09:47.958 --> 00:09:50.958\nIt means it gets filled with hot air.\n\n00:09:50.958 --> 00:09:54.958\nWhat's matzah? What's unleavened bread? You don't get it.\n\n00:09:54.958 --> 00:09:59.958\nSymbolically, what the rabbis say is that at Passover,\n\n00:09:59.958 --> 00:10:05.958\nwhat we have to do is try to get rid of our hot air -- our pride,\n\n00:10:05.958 --> 00:10:09.958\nour feeling that we are the most important people in the whole entire world,\n\n00:10:09.958 --> 00:10:13.958\nand that everything should revolve round us.\n\n00:10:13.958 --> 00:10:16.958\nSo we try and get rid of those,\n\n00:10:16.958 --> 00:10:23.958\nand so doing, try to get rid of the habits, the emotions, the ideas\n\n00:10:23.958 --> 00:10:29.958\nthat enslave us, that make our eyes closed, give us tunnel vision\n\n00:10:29.958 --> 00:10:32.958\nso we don't see the needs of others --\n\n00:10:32.958 --> 00:10:36.958\nand free ourselves and free ourselves from that.\n\n00:10:36.958 --> 00:10:41.958\nAnd that too is a basis for having compassion,\n\n00:10:41.958 --> 00:10:47.958\nfor understanding our place in the world.\n\n00:10:47.958 --> 00:10:52.958\nNow there is, in Judaism, a gorgeous story\n\n00:10:52.958 --> 00:10:58.958\nof a rich man who sat in synagogue one day.\n\n00:10:58.958 --> 00:11:04.958\nAnd, as many people do, he was dozing off during the sermon.\n\n00:11:04.958 --> 00:11:10.958\nAnd as he was dozing off, they were reading from the book of Leviticus in the Torah.\n\n00:11:10.958 --> 00:11:16.958\nAnd they were saying that in the ancient times in the temple in Jerusalem,\n\n00:11:16.958 --> 00:11:18.958\nthe priests used to have bread,\n\n00:11:18.958 --> 00:11:26.958\nwhich they used to place into a special table in the temple in Jerusalem.\n\n00:11:26.958 --> 00:11:33.958\nThe man was asleep, but he heard the words bread, temple, God, and he woke up.\n\n00:11:33.958 --> 00:11:38.958\nHe said, \"God wants bread. That's it. God wants bread. I know what God wants.\"\n\n00:11:38.958 --> 00:11:45.958\nAnd he rushed home. And after the Sabbath, he made 12 loaves of bread,\n\n00:11:45.958 --> 00:11:48.958\ntook them to the synagogue, went into the synagogue,\n\n00:11:48.958 --> 00:11:52.958\nopened the ark and said, \"God, I don't know why you want this bread, but here you are.\"\n\n00:11:52.958 --> 00:11:57.958\nAnd he put it in the ark with the scrolls of the Torah.\n\n00:11:57.958 --> 00:12:00.958\nThen he went home.\n\n00:12:00.958 --> 00:12:03.958\nThe cleaner came into the synagogue.\n\n00:12:03.958 --> 00:12:07.958\n\"Oh God, I'm in such trouble. I've got children to feed.\n\n00:12:07.958 --> 00:12:11.958\nMy wife's ill. I've got no money. What can I do?\"\n\n00:12:11.958 --> 00:12:15.958\nHe goes into the synagogue. \"God, will you please help me?\n\n00:12:15.958 --> 00:12:17.958\nAh, what a wonderful smell.\"\n\n00:12:17.958 --> 00:12:19.958\nHe goes to the ark. He opens the ark.\n\n00:12:19.958 --> 00:12:24.958\n\"There's bread! God, you've answered my plea. You've answered my question.\"\n\n00:12:24.958 --> 00:12:27.958\nTakes the bread and goes home.\n\n00:12:27.958 --> 00:12:30.958\nMeanwhile, the rich man thinks to himself,\n\n00:12:30.958 --> 00:12:33.958\n\"I'm an idiot. God wants bread?\n\n00:12:33.958 --> 00:12:38.958\nGod, the one who rules the entire universe, wants my bread?\"\n\n00:12:38.958 --> 00:12:41.958\nHe rushes to the synagogue. \"I'll get it out of the ark before anybody finds it.\"\n\n00:12:41.958 --> 00:12:44.958\nHe goes in there, and it's not there.\n\n00:12:44.958 --> 00:12:49.958\nAnd he says, \"God, you really did want it.

It cannot be consciously a contributor. It is helpless. It doesn't know how to survive, even though it is endowed with an instinct to survive. It needs the help of mother, or a foster mother, to survive. It can't afford to doubt the person who tends the child. It has to totally surrender, as one surrenders to an anesthesiologist.It has to totally surrender. That implies a lot of trust. That implies the trusted person won't violate the trust. As the child grows, it begins to discover that the person trusted is violating the trust. It doesn't know even the word \"violation.\" Therefore, it has to blame itself, a wordless blame, which is more difficult to really resolve \u2014 the wordless self-blame.As the child grows to become an adult: so far, it has been a consumer, but the growth of a human being lies in his or her capacity to contribute, to be a contributor. One cannot contribute unless one feels secure, one feels big, one feels: I have enough.To be compassionate is not a joke. It's not that simple. One has to discover a certain bigness in oneself. That bigness should be centered on oneself, not in terms of money, not in terms of power you wield, not in terms of any status that you can command in the society, but it should be centered on oneself. The self: you are self-aware. On that self, it should be centered \u2014 a bigness, a wholeness. Otherwise, compassion is just a word and a dream.You can be compassionate occasionally, more moved by empathy than by compassion. Thank God we are empathetic. When somebody's in pain, we pick up the pain.In a Wimbledon final match, these two guys fight it out. Each one has got two games. It can be anybody's game. What they have sweated so far has no meaning. One person wins. The tennis etiquette is, both the players have to come to the net and shake hands. The winner boxes the air and kisses the ground, throws his shirt as though somebody is waiting for it. (Laughter) And this guy has to come to the net. When he comes to the net, you see, his whole face changes. It looks as though he's wishing that he didn't win. Why? Empathy.That's human heart. No human heart is denied of that empathy. No religion can demolish that by indoctrination. No culture, no nation and nationalism \u2014 nothing can touch it because it is empathy. And that capacity to empathize is the window through which you reach out to people, you do something that makes a difference in somebody's life \u2014 even words, even time.Compassion is not defined in one form. There's no Indian compassion. There's no American compassion. It transcends nation, the gender, the age. Why? Because it is there in everybody. It's experienced by people occasionally.Then this occasional compassion, we are not talking about \u2014 it will never remain occasional. By mandate, you cannot make a person compassionate. You can't say, \"Please love me.\" Love is something you discover. It's not an action, but in the English language, it is also an action. I will come to it later.So one has got to discover a certain wholeness. I am going to cite the possibility of being whole, which is within our experience, everybody's experience. In spite of a very tragic life, one is happy in moments which are very few and far between. And the one who is happy, even for a slapstick joke, accepts himself and also the scheme of things in which one finds oneself.That means the whole universe, known things and unknown things. All of them are totally accepted because you discover your wholeness in yourself. The subject \u2014 \"me\" \u2014 and the object \u2014 the scheme of things \u2014 fuse into oneness, an experience nobody can say, \"I am denied of,\" an experience common to all and sundry.That experience confirms that, in spite of all your limitations \u2014 all your wants, desires, unfulfilled, and the credit cards and layoffs and, finally, baldness \u2014 you can be happy. But the extension of the logic is that you don't need to fulfill your desire to be happy. You are the very happiness, the wholeness that you want to be.There's no choice in this: that only confirms the reality that the wholeness cannot be different from you, cannot be minus you. It has got to be you. You cannot be a part of wholeness and still be whole. Your moment of happiness reveals that reality, that realization, that recognition: \"Maybe I am the whole. Maybe the swami is right.Maybe the swami is right.\" You start your new life. Then everything becomes meaningful. I have no more reason to blame myself. If one has to blame oneself, one has a million reasons plus many. But if I say, in spite of my body being limited \u2014 if it is black it is not white, if it is white it is not black: body is limited any which way you look at it. Limited.Your knowledge is limited, health is limited, and power is therefore limited, and the cheerfulness is going to be limited. Compassion is going to be limited. Everything is going to be limitless. You cannot command compassion unless you become limitless, and nobody can become limitless, either you are or you are not. Period. And there is no way of your being not limitless too.Your own experience reveals, in spite of all limitations, you are the whole. And the wholeness is the reality of you when you relate to the world. It is love first. When you relate to the world, the dynamic manifestation of the wholeness is, what we say, love. And itself becomes compassion if the object that you relate to evokes that emotion. Then that again transforms into giving, into sharing. You express yourself because you have compassion.To discover compassion, you need to be compassionate. To discover the capacity to give and share, you need to be giving and sharing. There is no shortcut: it is like swimming by swimming. You learn swimming by swimming. You cannot learn swimming on a foam mattress and enter into water. (Laughter) You learn swimming by swimming. You learn cycling by cycling. You learn cooking by cooking, having some sympathetic people around you to eat what you cook. (Laughter)And, therefore, what I say, you have to fake it and make it. (Laughter) You need to. My predecessor meant that. You have to act it out. You have to act compassionately.There is no verb for compassion, but you have an adverb for compassion. That's interesting to me. You act compassionately. But then, how to act compassionately if you don't have compassion? That is where you fake. You fake it and make it. This is the mantra of the United States of America. (Laughter)You fake it and make it. You act compassionately as though you have compassion: grind your teeth, take all the support system. If you know how to pray, pray. Ask for compassion. Let me act compassionately. Do it. You'll discover compassion and also slowly a relative compassion, and slowly, perhaps if you get the right teaching, you'll discover compassion is a dynamic manifestation of the reality of yourself, which is oneness, wholeness, and that's what you are.With these words, thank you very much.

Come with me to 915 South Bloodworth Street in Raleigh, North Carolina, where I grew up. If you come in you will see us: evening time, at table \u2014 set for ten but not always all seats filled \u2014 at the point when dinner is ready to be served. Since mom had eight kids, sometimes she said she couldn't tell who was who and where they were. Before we could eat, she would ask, \"Are all the children in?\" And if someone happened to be missing, we would have to, we say, \"Fix a plate\" for that person, put it in the oven, then we could say grace, and we could eat.Also, while we were at the table, there was a ritual in our family: when something significant had happened for any one of us \u2014 whether mom had just been elected as the president of the PTA, or whether dad had gotten an assignment at the college of our denomination, or whether someone had won the jabberwocky contest for talent \u2014 the ritual at the family was, once the announcement is made, we must take five, ten minutes to do what we call \"make over\" that person \u2014 that is, to make a fuss over the one who had been honored in some way. For when one is honored, all are honored.Also, we had to make a report on our extended \"visited\" members, that is, extended members of the family, sick and elderly, shut in. My task was, at least once a week, to visit Mother Lassiter who lived on East Street, Mother Williamson who lived on Bledsoe Avenue, and Mother Lathers who lived on Oberlin Road. Why? Because they were old and infirm, and we needed to go by to see if they needed anything. For mom said, \"To be family, is to care and share and to look out for one another. They are our family.\"And, of course, sometimes there was a bonus for going. They would offer sweets or money. Mom says, \"If they ask you what it costs to either go shopping for them, you must always say, 'Nothing.' And if they insist, say, 'Whatever you mind to give me.'\" This was the nature of being at that table. In fact, she indicated that if we would do that, not only would we have the joy of receiving the gratitude from the members of the extended family, but she said, \"Even God will smile, and when God smiles, there is peace, and justice, and joy.\"So, at the table at 915, I learned something about compassion. Of course, it was a minister's family, so we had to add God into it. And so, I came to think that mama eternal, mama eternal, is always wondering: Are all the children in? And if we had been faithful in caring and sharing, we had the sense that justice and peace would have a chance in the world.Now, it was not always wonderful at that table. Let me explain a point at which we did not rise to the occasion. It was Christmas, and at our family, oh, what a morning. Christmas morning, where we open up our gifts, where we have special prayers, and where we get to the old upright piano and we would sing carols. It was a very intimate moment. In fact, you could come down to the tree to get your gifts and get ready to sing, and then get ready for breakfast without even taking a bath or getting dressed, except that daddy messed it up.There was a member of his staff who did not have any place on that particular Christmas to celebrate. And daddy brought Elder Revels to the Christmas family celebration. We thought he must be out of his mind. This is our time. This is intimate time. This is when we can just be who we are, and now we have this stuffy brother with his shirt and tie on, while we are still in our PJs. Why would daddy bring Elder Revels? Any other time, but not to the Christmas celebration.And mom overheard us and said, \"Well, you know what? If you really understand the nature of this celebration, it is that this is a time where you extend the circle of love. That's what the celebration is all about. It's time to make space, to share the enjoyment of life in a beloved community.\" So, we sucked up. (Laughter)But growing up at 915, compassion was not a word to be debated; it was a sensibility to how we are together. We are sisters and brothers united together. And, like Chief Seattle said, \"We did not spin the web of life. We're all strands in it. And whatever we do to the web, we do to ourselves.\" Now that's compassion.So, let me tell you, I kind of look at the world this way. I see pictures, and something says, \"Now, that's compassion.\" A harvested field of grain, with some grain in the corners, reminding me of the Hebrew tradition that you may indeed harvest, but you must always leave some on the edges, just in case there's someone who has not had the share necessary for good nurture. Talk about a picture of compassion.I see \u2014 always, it stirs my heart \u2014 a picture of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. walking arm in arm with Andy Young and Rabbi Heschel and maybe Thich Nhat Hanh and some of the other saints assembled, walking across the bridge and going into Selma. Just a photograph. Arm in arm for struggle. Suffering together in a common hope that we can be brothers and sisters without the accidents of our birth or our ethnicity robbing us of a sense of unity of being.So, there's another picture. Here, this one. I really do like this picture. When Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. was assassinated, that day, everybody in my community was upset. You heard about riots all across the land. Bobby Kennedy was scheduled to bring an inner city message in Indianapolis. This is the picture. They said, \"It's going to be too volatile for you to go.\" He insisted, \"I must go.\"So, sitting on a flatbed truck, the elders of the community are there, and Bobby stands up and says to the people, \"I have bad news for you. Some of you may not have heard that Dr. King has been assassinated. I know that you are angry, and I know that you would almost wish to have the opportunity to enter now into activities of revenge. But,\" he said, \"what I really want you to know is that I know how you feel. Because I had someone dear to me snatched away. I know how you feel.\" And he said, \"I hope that you will have the strength to do what I did. I allowed my anger, my bitterness, my grief to simmer a while, and then I made up my mind that I was going to make a different world, and we can do that together.\" That's a picture. Compassion? I think I see it.I saw it when the Dalai Lama came to the Riverside Church while I was a pastor, and he invited representatives of faith traditions from all around the world. He asked them to give a message, and they each read in their own language a central affirmation, and that was some version of the golden rule: \"As you would that others would do unto you, do also unto them.\" Twelve in their ecclesiastical or cultural or tribal attire affirming one message. We are so connected that we must treat each other as if an action toward you is an action toward myself.One more picture while I'm stinking and thinking about the Riverside Church: 9/11. Last night at Chagrin Fall, a newspaperman and a television guy said, \"That evening, when a service was held at the Riverside Church, we carried it on our station in this city. It was,\" he said, \"one of the most powerful moments of life together. We were all suffering. But you invited representatives of all of the traditions to come, and you invited them. 'Find out what it is in your tradition that tells us what to do when we have been humiliated, when we have been despised and rejected.' And they all spoke out of their own traditions, a word about the healing power of solidarity, one with the other.\"I developed a sense of compassion sort of as second nature, but I became a preacher. Now, as a preacher, I got a job. I got to preach the stuff, but I got to do it too. Or, as Father Divine in Harlem used to say to folks, \"Some people preach the Gospel. I have to tangibilitate the Gospel.\" So, the real issue is: How do you tangibilitate compassion? How do you make it real?My faith has constantly lifted up the ideal, and challenged me when I fell beneath it. In my tradition, there is a gift that we have made to other traditions \u2014 to everybody around the world who knows the story of the \"Good Samaritan.\" Many people think of it primarily in terms of charity, random acts of kindness. But for those who really study that text a little more thoroughly, you will discover that a question has been raised that leads to this parable.The question was: \"What is the greatest commandment?\" And, according to Jesus, the word comes forth, \"You must love yourself, you must love the Lord your God with all your heart, mind and soul, and your neighbor as yourself.\"And then the person asked, \"Well, what do you mean, 'neighbor?'\"And he answered it by telling the story of the man who fell among thieves, and how religious authorities went the other way, and how their supporters in the congregation went the other way; but an unsuspecting, despised person came along, saw the man in need, provided oil and wine for his wounds, put him on his own transportation, and took him to the inn and asked the innkeeper, \"Take care of him.\" And he said, \"Here, this is the initial investment, but if needs continue, make sure that you provide them. And whatever else is needed, I will provide it and pay for it when I return.\"This always seemed to me to be a deepening of the sense of what it means to be a Good Samaritan. A Good Samaritan is not simply one whose heart is touched in an immediate act of care and charity, but one who provides a system of sustained care \u2014 I like that, 'a system of sustained care ' \u2014 in the inn, take care. I think maybe it's one time when the Bible talks about a healthcare system and a commitment to do whatever is necessary \u2014 that all God's children would have their needs cared for, so that we could answer when mommy eternal asks, \"In regards to health, are all the children in?\" And we could say yes.Oh, what a joy it has been to be a person seeking to tangibilitate compassion. I recall that my work as a pastor has always involved caring for their spiritual needs; being concerned for housing, for healthcare, for the prisoners, for the infirm, for children \u2014 even the foster care children for whom no one can even keep a record where they started off, where they are going. To be a pastor is to care for these individual needs.But now, to be a Good Samaritan \u2014 and I always say, and to be a good American \u2014 for me, is not simply to congratulate myself for the individual acts of care. Compassion takes on a corporate dynamic. I believe that whatever we did around that table at Bloodworth Street must be done around tables and rituals of faith until we become that family, that family together that understands the nature of our unity. We are one people together.So, let me explain to you what I mean when I think about compassion, and why I think it is so important that right at this point in history. We would decide to establish this charter of compassion. The reason it's important is because this is a very special time in history. It is the time that, biblically, we would speak of as the day, or the year, of God's favor. This is a season of grace. Unusual things are beginning to happen. Please pardon me, as a black man, for celebrating that the election of Obama was an unusual sign of the fact that it is a year of favor. And yet, there is so much more that needs to be done. We need to bring health and food and education and respect for all God's citizens, all God's children, remembering mama eternal.Now, let me close my comments by telling you that whenever I feel something very deeply, it usually takes the form of verse. And so I want to close with a little song. I close with this song \u2014 it's a children's song \u2014 because we are all children at the table of mama eternal. And if mama eternal has taught us correctly, this song will make sense, not only to those of us who are a part of this gathering, but to all who sign the charter for compassion. And this is why we do it.The song says, \u266b \"I made heaven so happy today, \u266b \u266b Receiving God's love and giving it away \u266b \u266b When I looked up, heaven smiled at me \u266b \u266b Now, I'm so happy. Can't you see? \u266b \u266b I'm happy. Look at me. I'm happy. Can't you see? \u266b \u266b Sharing makes me happy, makes heaven happy too \u266b \u266b I'm happy. Look at me. I'm happy. Can't you see? \u266b \u266b Let me share my happy loving smile with you. \u266bThat's compassion.

Because they were old and infirm,\n\n00:02:26.958 --> 00:02:30.958\nand we needed to go by to see if they needed anything.\n\n00:02:30.958 --> 00:02:37.958\nFor mom said, \"To be family, is to care and share and to look out for one another.\n\n00:02:37.958 --> 00:02:39.958\nThey are our family.\"\n\n00:02:39.958 --> 00:02:42.958\nAnd, of course, sometimes there was a bonus for going.\n\n00:02:42.958 --> 00:02:45.958\nThey would offer sweets or money.\n\n00:02:45.958 --> 00:02:49.958\nMom says, \"If they ask you what it costs to either go shopping for them,\n\n00:02:49.958 --> 00:02:51.958\nyou must always say, 'Nothing.'\n\n00:02:51.958 --> 00:02:56.958\nAnd if they insist, say, 'Whatever you mind to give me.'\"\n\n00:02:56.958 --> 00:02:59.958\nThis was the nature of being at that table.\n\n00:02:59.958 --> 00:03:04.958\nIn fact, she indicated that if we would do that,\n\n00:03:04.958 --> 00:03:09.958\nnot only would we have the joy of receiving the gratitude\n\n00:03:09.958 --> 00:03:11.958\nfrom the members of the extended family,\n\n00:03:11.958 --> 00:03:18.958\nbut she said, \"Even God will smile, and when God smiles,\n\n00:03:18.958 --> 00:03:21.958\nthere is peace, and justice, and joy.\"\n\n00:03:21.958 --> 00:03:28.958\nSo, at the table at 915, I learned something about compassion.\n\n00:03:28.958 --> 00:03:31.958\nOf course, it was a minister's family,\n\n00:03:31.958 --> 00:03:34.958\nso we had to add God into it.\n\n00:03:34.958 --> 00:03:41.958\nAnd so, I came to think that mama eternal, mama eternal,\n\n00:03:41.958 --> 00:03:46.958\nis always wondering: Are all the children in?\n\n00:03:46.958 --> 00:03:51.958\nAnd if we had been faithful in caring and sharing,\n\n00:03:51.958 --> 00:03:56.958\nwe had the sense that justice and peace would have a chance in the world.\n\n00:03:56.958 --> 00:03:58.958\nNow, it was not always wonderful at that table.\n\n00:03:58.958 --> 00:04:03.958\nLet me explain a point at which we did not rise to the occasion.\n\n00:04:03.958 --> 00:04:08.958\nIt was Christmas, and at our family, oh, what a morning.\n\n00:04:08.958 --> 00:04:11.958\nChristmas morning, where we open up our gifts,\n\n00:04:11.958 --> 00:04:15.958\nwhere we have special prayers, and where we get to the old upright piano\n\n00:04:15.958 --> 00:04:18.958\nand we would sing carols. It was a very intimate moment.\n\n00:04:18.958 --> 00:04:24.958\nIn fact, you could come down to the tree to get your gifts and get ready to sing,\n\n00:04:24.958 --> 00:04:29.958\nand then get ready for breakfast without even taking a bath or getting dressed,\n\n00:04:29.958 --> 00:04:31.958\nexcept that daddy messed it up.\n\n00:04:31.958 --> 00:04:36.958\nThere was a member of his staff who did not have any place\n\n00:04:36.958 --> 00:04:40.958\non that particular Christmas to celebrate.\n\n00:04:40.958 --> 00:04:47.958\nAnd daddy brought Elder Revels to the Christmas family celebration.\n\n00:04:47.958 --> 00:04:49.958\nWe thought he must be out of his mind.\n\n00:04:49.958 --> 00:04:52.958\nThis is our time. This is intimate time.\n\n00:04:52.958 --> 00:04:54.958\nThis is when we can just be who we are,\n\n00:04:54.958 --> 00:04:57.958\nand now we have this stuffy brother\n\n00:04:57.958 --> 00:05:01.958\nwith his shirt and tie on, while we are still in our PJs.\n\n00:05:01.958 --> 00:05:07.958\nWhy would daddy bring Elder Revels?\n\n00:05:07.958 --> 00:05:11.958\nAny other time, but not to the Christmas celebration.\n\n00:05:11.958 --> 00:05:13.958\nAnd mom overheard us and said,\n\n00:05:13.958 --> 00:05:19.958\n\"Well, you know what? If you really understand the nature of this celebration,\n\n00:05:19.958 --> 00:05:25.958\nit is that this is a time where you extend the circle of love.\n\n00:05:25.958 --> 00:05:28.958\nThat's what the celebration is all about.\n\n00:05:28.958 --> 00:05:37.958\nIt's time to make space, to share the enjoyment of life in a beloved community.\"\n\n00:05:37.958 --> 00:05:39.958\nSo, we sucked up.\n\n00:05:39.958 --> 00:05:41.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:05:41.958 --> 00:05:48.958\nBut growing up at 915, compassion was not a word to be debated;\n\n00:05:48.958 --> 00:05:54.958\nit was a sensibility to how we are together.\n\n00:05:54.958 --> 00:05:58.958\nWe are sisters and brothers united together.\n\n00:05:58.958 --> 00:06:04.958\nAnd, like Chief Seattle said, \"We did not spin the web of life.\n\n00:06:04.958 --> 00:06:06.958\nWe're all strands in it.\n\n00:06:06.958 --> 00:06:10.958\nAnd whatever we do to the web, we do to ourselves.\"\n\n00:06:10.958 --> 00:06:12.958\nNow that's compassion.\n\n00:06:12.958 --> 00:06:15.958\nSo, let me tell you, I kind of look at the world this way.\n\n00:06:15.958 --> 00:06:20.958\nI see pictures, and something says, \"Now, that's compassion.\"\n\n00:06:20.958 --> 00:06:29.958\nA harvested field of grain, with some grain in the corners,\n\n00:06:29.958 --> 00:06:32.958\nreminding me of the Hebrew tradition\n\n00:06:32.958 --> 00:06:34.958\nthat you may indeed harvest,\n\n00:06:34.958 --> 00:06:38.958\nbut you must always leave some on the edges,\n\n00:06:38.958 --> 00:06:41.958\njust in case there's someone who has not\n\n00:06:41.958 --> 00:06:46.958\nhad the share necessary for good nurture.\n\n00:06:46.958 --> 00:06:49.958\nTalk about a picture of compassion.\n\n00:06:49.958 --> 00:06:53.958\nI see -- always, it stirs my heart --\n\n00:06:53.958 --> 00:06:57.958\na picture of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.\n\n00:06:57.958 --> 00:07:02.958\nwalking arm in arm with Andy Young and Rabbi Heschel\n\n00:07:02.958 --> 00:07:07.958\nand maybe Thich Nhat Hanh and some of the other saints assembled,\n\n00:07:07.958 --> 00:07:11.958\nwalking across the bridge and going into Selma.\n\n00:07:11.958 --> 00:07:13.958\nJust a photograph.\n\n00:07:13.958 --> 00:07:16.958\nArm in arm for struggle.\n\n00:07:16.958 --> 00:07:23.958\nSuffering together in a common hope that we can be brothers and sisters\n\n00:07:23.958 --> 00:07:28.958\nwithout the accidents of our birth or our ethnicity\n\n00:07:28.958 --> 00:07:32.958\nrobbing us of a sense of unity of being.\n\n00:07:32.958 --> 00:07:37.958\nSo, there's another picture. Here, this one. I really do like this picture.\n\n00:07:37.958 --> 00:07:41.958\nWhen Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. was assassinated,\n\n00:07:41.958 --> 00:07:48.958\nthat day, everybody in my community was upset.\n\n00:07:48.958 --> 00:07:53.958\nYou heard about riots all across the land.\n\n00:07:53.958 --> 00:08:02.958\nBobby Kennedy was scheduled to bring an inner city message in Indianapolis.\n\n00:08:02.958 --> 00:08:05.958\nThis is the picture. They said,\n\n00:08:05.958 --> 00:08:08.958\n\"It's going to be too volatile for you to go.\"\n\n00:08:08.958 --> 00:08:11.958\nHe insisted, \"I must go.\"\n\n00:08:11.958 --> 00:08:15.958\nSo, sitting on a flatbed truck,\n\n00:08:15.958 --> 00:08:17.958\nthe elders of the community are there,\n\n00:08:17.958 --> 00:08:21.958\nand Bobby stands up and says to the people,\n\n00:08:21.958 --> 00:08:23.958\n\"I have bad news for you.\n\n00:08:23.958 --> 00:08:27.958\nSome of you may not have heard that Dr. King has been assassinated.\n\n00:08:27.958 --> 00:08:30.958\nI know that you are angry,\n\n00:08:30.958 --> 00:08:33.958\nand I know that you would almost wish to have the opportunity\n\n00:08:33.958 --> 00:08:36.958\nto enter now into activities of revenge. But,\"\n\n00:08:36.958 --> 00:08:43.958\nhe said, \"what I really want you to know is that I know how you feel.\n\n00:08:43.958 --> 00:08:49.958\nBecause I had someone dear to me snatched away.\n\n00:08:49.958 --> 00:08:52.958\nI know how you feel.\"\n\n00:08:52.958 --> 00:08:58.958\nAnd he said, \"I hope that you will have the strength to do what I did.\n\n00:08:58.958 --> 00:09:04.958\nI allowed my anger, my bitterness, my grief to simmer a while,\n\n00:09:04.958 --> 00:09:09.958\nand then I made up my mind that I was going to make a different world,\n\n00:09:09.958 --> 00:09:11.958\nand we can do that together.\"\n\n00:09:11.958 --> 00:09:15.958\nThat's a picture. Compassion? I think I see it.\n\n00:09:15.958 --> 00:09:22.958\nI saw it when the Dalai Lama came to the Riverside Church while I was a pastor,\n\n00:09:22.958 --> 00:09:29.958\nand he invited representatives of faith traditions from all around the world.\n\n00:09:29.958 --> 00:09:32.958\nHe asked them to give a message,\n\n00:09:32.958 --> 00:09:39.958\nand they each read in their own language a central affirmation,\n\n00:09:39.958 --> 00:09:44.958\nand that was some version of the golden rule:\n\n00:09:44.958 --> 00:09:48.958\n\"As you would that others would do unto you,\n\n00:09:48.958 --> 00:09:53.958\ndo also unto them.\"\n\n00:09:53.958 --> 00:09:59.958\nTwelve in their ecclesiastical or cultural or tribal attire\n\n00:09:59.958 --> 00:10:02.958\naffirming one message.\n\n00:10:02.958 --> 00:10:06.958\nWe are so connected that we must treat each other\n\n00:10:06.958 --> 00:10:12.958\nas if an action toward you is an action toward myself.\n\n00:10:12.958 --> 00:10:17.958\nOne more picture while I'm stinking and thinking about the Riverside Church:\n\n00:10:17.958 --> 00:10:23.958\n9/11. Last night at Chagrin Fall,\n\n00:10:23.958 --> 00:10:27.958\na newspaperman and a television guy said,\n\n00:10:27.958 --> 00:10:33.958\n\"That evening, when a service was held at the Riverside Church,\n\n00:10:33.958 --> 00:10:37.958\nwe carried it on our station in this city.\n\n00:10:37.958 --> 00:10:45.958\nIt was,\" he said, \"one of the most powerful moments of life together.\n\n00:10:45.958 --> 00:10:47.958\nWe were all suffering.\n\n00:10:47.958 --> 00:10:53.958\nBut you invited representatives of all of the traditions to come,\n\n00:10:53.958 --> 00:10:55.958\nand you invited them.\n\n00:10:55.958 --> 00:10:59.958\n'Find out what it is in your tradition\n\n00:10:59.958 --> 00:11:03.958\nthat tells us what to do when we have been humiliated,\n\n00:11:03.958 --> 00:11:07.958\nwhen we have been despised and rejected.'\n\n00:11:07.958 --> 00:11:10.958\nAnd they all spoke out of their own traditions,\n\n00:11:10.958 --> 00:11:17.958\na word about the healing power of solidarity, one with the other.\"\n\n00:11:17.958 --> 00:11:24.958\nI developed a sense of compassion sort of as second nature,\n\n00:11:24.958 --> 00:11:26.958\nbut I became a preacher.\n\n00:11:26.958 --> 00:11:30.958\nNow, as a preacher, I got a job. I got to preach the stuff,\n\n00:11:30.958 --> 00:11:32.958\nbut I got to do it too.\n\n00:11:32.958 --> 00:11:36.958\nOr, as Father Divine in Harlem used to say to folks,\n\n00:11:36.958 --> 00:11:39.958\n\"Some people preach the Gospel.\n\n00:11:39.958 --> 00:11:41.958\nI have to tangibilitate the Gospel.\"\n\n00:11:41.958 --> 00:11:47.958\nSo, the real issue is: How do you tangibilitate compassion?\n\n00:11:47.958 --> 00:11:50.958\nHow do you make it real?\n\n00:11:50.958 --> 00:11:54.958\nMy faith has constantly lifted up the ideal,\n\n00:11:54.958 --> 00:11:58.958\nand challenged me when I fell beneath it.\n\n00:11:58.958 --> 00:12:04.958\nIn my tradition, there is a gift that we have made to other traditions --\n\n00:12:04.958 --> 00:12:12.958\nto everybody around the world who knows the story of the \"Good Samaritan.\"\n\n00:12:12.958 --> 00:12:19.958\nMany people think of it primarily in terms of charity,\n\n00:12:19.958 --> 00:12:22.958\nrandom acts of kindness.\n\n00:12:22.958 --> 00:12:28.958\nBut for those who really study that text a little more thoroughly,\n\n00:12:28.958 --> 00:12:31.958\nyou will discover that a question has been raised\n\n00:12:31.958 --> 00:12:33.958\nthat leads to this parable.\n\n00:12:33.958 --> 00:12:37.958\nThe question was: \"What is the greatest commandment?\"\n\n00:12:37.958 --> 00:12:40.958\nAnd, according to Jesus, the word comes forth,\n\n00:12:40.958 --> 00:12:42.958\n\"You must love yourself,\n\n00:12:42.958 --> 00:12:46.958\nyou must love the Lord your God with all your heart, mind and soul,\n\n00:12:46.958 --> 00:12:50.958\nand your neighbor as yourself.\"\n\n00:12:50.958 --> 00:12:56.958\nAnd then the person asked, \"Well, what do you mean, 'neighbor?'\"\n\n00:12:56.958 --> 00:13:02.958\nAnd he answered it by telling the story of the man who fell among thieves,\n\n00:13:02.958 --> 00:13:08.958\nand how religious authorities went the other way,\n\n00:13:08.958 --> 00:13:12.958\nand how their supporters in the congregation went the other way;\n\n00:13:12.958 --> 00:13:17.958\nbut an unsuspecting, despised person came along,\n\n00:13:17.958 --> 00:13:20.958\nsaw the man in need,\n\n00:13:20.958 --> 00:13:24.958\nprovided oil and wine for his wounds,\n\n00:13:24.958 --> 00:13:29.958\nput him on his own transportation,\n\n00:13:29.958 --> 00:13:32.958\nand took him to the inn\n\n00:13:32.958 --> 00:13:36.958\nand asked the innkeeper, \"Take care of him.\"\n\n00:13:36.958 --> 00:13:43.958\nAnd he said, \"Here, this is the initial investment,\n\n00:13:43.958 --> 00:13:49.958\nbut if needs continue, make sure that you provide them.\n\n00:13:49.958 --> 00:13:56.958\nAnd whatever else is needed, I will provide it and pay for it when I return.\"\n\n00:13:56.958 --> 00:13:59.958\nThis always seemed to me to be a deepening\n\n00:13:59.958 --> 00:14:03.958\nof the sense of what it means to be a Good Samaritan.\n\n00:14:03.958 --> 00:14:06.958\nA Good Samaritan is not simply one whose heart is touched\n\n00:14:06.958 --> 00:14:10.958\nin an immediate act of care and charity,\n\n00:14:10.958 --> 00:14:14.958\nbut one who provides a system of sustained care -- I like that,\n\n00:14:14.958 --> 00:14:18.958\n'a system of sustained care ' -- in the inn, take care.\n\n00:14:18.958 --> 00:14:23.958\nI think maybe it's one time when the Bible talks about a healthcare system\n\n00:14:23.958 --> 00:14:27.958\nand a commitment to do whatever is necessary --\n\n00:14:27.958 --> 00:14:30.958\nthat all God's children would have their needs cared for,\n\n00:14:30.958 --> 00:14:36.958\nso that we could answer when mommy eternal asks, \"In regards to health,\n\n00:14:36.958 --> 00:14:39.958\nare all the children in?\" And we could say yes.\n\n00:14:39.958 --> 00:14:48.958\nOh, what a joy it has been to be a person seeking to tangibilitate compassion.\n\n00:14:48.958 --> 00:14:51.958\nI recall that my work as a pastor\n\n00:14:51.958 --> 00:14:56.958\nhas always involved caring for their spiritual needs;\n\n00:14:56.958 --> 00:15:00.958\nbeing concerned for housing, for healthcare,\n\n00:15:00.958 --> 00:15:04.958\nfor the prisoners, for the infirm, for children --\n\n00:15:04.958 --> 00:15:10.958\neven the foster care children for whom no one can even keep a record\n\n00:15:10.958 --> 00:15:12.958\nwhere they started off, where they are going.\n\n00:15:12.958 --> 00:15:17.958\nTo be a pastor is to care for these individual needs.\n\n00:15:17.958 --> 00:15:21.958\nBut now, to be a Good Samaritan -- and I always say,\n\n00:15:21.958 --> 00:15:24.958\nand to be a good American -- for me,\n\n00:15:24.958 --> 00:15:29.958\nis not simply to congratulate myself for the individual acts of care.\n\n00:15:29.958 --> 00:15:34.958\nCompassion takes on a corporate dynamic.\n\n00:15:34.958 --> 00:15:41.958\nI believe that whatever we did around that table at Bloodworth Street\n\n00:15:41.958 --> 00:15:46.958\nmust be done around tables and rituals of faith\n\n00:15:46.958 --> 00:15:52.958\nuntil we become that family, that family together\n\n00:15:52.958 --> 00:15:55.958\nthat understands the nature of our unity.\n\n00:15:55.958 --> 00:15:59.958\nWe are one people together.\n\n00:15:59.958 --> 00:16:05.958\nSo, let me explain to you what I mean when I think about compassion,\n\n00:16:05.958 --> 00:16:11.958\nand why I think it is so important that right at this point in history.\n\n00:16:11.958 --> 00:16:16.958\nWe would decide to establish this charter of compassion.\n\n00:16:16.958 --> 00:16:26.958\nThe reason it's important is because this is a very special time in history.\n\n00:16:26.958 --> 00:16:30.958\nIt is the time that, biblically, we would speak of as\n\n00:16:30.958 --> 00:16:34.958\nthe day, or the year, of God's favor.\n\n00:16:34.958 --> 00:16:36.958\nThis is a season of grace.\n\n00:16:36.958 --> 00:16:40.958\nUnusual things are beginning to happen.\n\n00:16:40.958 --> 00:16:42.958\nPlease pardon me, as a black man, for celebrating\n\n00:16:42.958 --> 00:16:47.958\nthat the election of Obama was an unusual sign\n\n00:16:47.958 --> 00:16:51.958\nof the fact that it is a year of favor.\n\n00:16:51.958 --> 00:16:58.958\nAnd yet, there is so much more that needs to be done.\n\n00:16:58.958 --> 00:17:03.958\nWe need to bring health and food and education\n\n00:17:03.958 --> 00:17:09.958\nand respect for all God's citizens, all God's children,\n\n00:17:09.958 --> 00:17:12.958\nremembering mama eternal.\n\n00:17:12.958 --> 00:17:16.958\nNow, let me close my comments by telling you\n\n00:17:16.958 --> 00:17:20.958\nthat whenever I feel something very deeply,\n\n00:17:20.958 --> 00:17:24.958\nit usually takes the form of verse.\n\n00:17:24.958 --> 00:17:28.958\nAnd so I want to close with a little song.\n\n00:17:28.958 --> 00:17:32.958\nI close with this song -- it's a children's song --\n\n00:17:32.958 --> 00:17:38.958\nbecause we are all children at the table of mama eternal.\n\n00:17:38.958 --> 00:17:42.958\nAnd if mama eternal has taught us correctly,\n\n00:17:42.958 --> 00:17:48.958\nthis song will make sense, not only to those of us who are a part of this gathering,\n\n00:17:48.958 --> 00:17:51.958\nbut to all who sign the charter for compassion.\n\n00:17:51.958 --> 00:17:53.958\nAnd this is why we do it.\n\n00:17:53.958 --> 00:17:57.958\nThe song says, \u266b \"I made heaven so happy today, \u266b\n\n00:17:57.958 --> 00:18:01.958\n\u266b Receiving God's love and giving it away \u266b\n\n00:18:01.958 --> 00:18:05.958\n\u266b When I looked up, heaven smiled at me \u266b\n\n00:18:05.958 --> 00:18:08.958\n\u266b Now, I'm so happy. Can't you see? \u266b\n\n00:18:08.958 --> 00:18:13.958\n\u266b I'm happy. Look at me. I'm happy. Can't you see? \u266b\n\n00:18:13.958 --> 00:18:17.958\n\u266b Sharing makes me happy, makes heaven happy too \u266b\n\n00:18:17.958 --> 00:18:21.958\n\u266b I'm happy. Look at me. I'm happy. Can't you see? \u266b\n\n00:18:21.958 --> 00:18:25.958\n\u266b Let me share my happy loving smile with you. \u266b\n\n00:18:25.958 --> 00:18:27.958\nThat's compassion. (Applause)"}, {"title": "Lose your ego, find your compassion", "duration": "1007", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/imam_feisal_abdul_rauf", "transcript": "I'm speaking about compassion from an Islamic point of view, and perhaps my faith is not very well thought of as being one that is grounded in compassion. The truth of the matter is otherwise.Our holy book, the Koran, consists of 114 chapters, and each chapter begins with what we call the basmala, the saying of \"In the name of God, the all compassionate, the all merciful,\" or, as Sir Richard Burton \u2014 not the Richard Burton who was married to Elizabeth Taylor, but the Sir Richard Burton who lived a century before that and who was a worldwide traveler and translator of many works of literature \u2014 translates it. \"In the name of God, the compassionating, the compassionate.\"And in a saying of the Koran, which to Muslims is God speaking to humanity, God says to his prophet Muhammad \u2014 whom we believe to be the last of a series of prophets, beginning with Adam, including Noah, including Moses, including Abraham, including Jesus Christ, and ending with Muhammad \u2014 that, \"We have not sent you, O Muhammad, except as a 'rahmah,' except as a source of compassion to humanity.\"For us human beings, and certainly for us as Muslims, whose mission, and whose purpose in following the path of the prophet is to make ourselves as much like the prophet. And the prophet, in one of his sayings, said, \"Adorn yourselves with the attributes of God.\" And because God Himself said that the primary attribute of his is compassion \u2014 in fact, the Koran says that \"God decreed upon himself compassion,\" or, \"reigned himself in by compassion\" \u2014 therefore, our objective and our mission must be to be sources of compassion, activators of compassion, actors of compassion and speakers of compassion and doers of compassion.That is all well and good, but where do we go wrong, and what is the source of the lack of compassion in the world? For the answer to this, we turn to our spiritual path. In every religious tradition, there is the outer path and the inner path, or the exoteric path and the esoteric path. The esoteric path of Islam is more popularly known as Sufism, or \"tasawwuf\" in Arabic. And these doctors or these masters, these spiritual masters of the Sufi tradition, refer to teachings and examples of our prophet that teach us where the source of our problems lies.In one of the battles that the prophet waged, he told his followers, \"We are returning from the lesser war to the greater war, to the greater battle.\"And they said, \"Messenger of God, we are battle-weary. How can we go to a greater battle?\"He said, \"That is the battle of the self, the battle of the ego.\" The sources of human problems have to do with egotism, \"I.\"The famous Sufi master Rumi, who is very well known to most of you, has a story in which he talks of a man who goes to the house of a friend, and he knocks on the door, and a voice answers, \"Who's there?\"\"It's me,\" or, more grammatically correctly, \"It is I,\" as we might say in English.The voice says, \"Go away.\"After many years of training, of disciplining, of search and struggle, he comes back. With much greater humility, he knocks again on the door.The voice asks, \"Who is there?\"He said, \"It is you, O heartbreaker.\"The door swings open, and the voice says, \"Come in, for there is no room in this house for two I's,\" \u2014 two capital I's, not these eyes \u2014 \"for two egos.\"And Rumi's stories are metaphors for the spiritual path. In the presence of God, there is no room for more than one \"I,\" and that is the \"I\" of divinity. In a teaching \u2014 called a \"hadith qudsi\" in our tradition \u2014 God says that, \"My servant,\" or \"My creature, my human creature, does not approach me by anything that is dearer to me than what I have asked them to do.\" And those of you who are employers know exactly what I mean. You want your employees to do what you ask them to do, and if they've done that, then they can do extra. But don't ignore what you've asked them to do.\"And,\" God says, \"my servant continues to get nearer to me, by doing more of what I've asked them to do\" \u2014 extra credit, we might call it \u2014 \"until I love him or love her. And when I love my servant,\" God says, \"I become the eyes by which he or she sees, the ears by which he or she listens, the hand by which he or she grasps, and the foot by which he or she walks, and the heart by which he or she understands.\" It is this merging of our self with divinity that is the lesson and purpose of our spiritual path and all of our faith traditions.Muslims regard Jesus as the master of Sufism, the greatest prophet and messenger who came to emphasize the spiritual path. When he says, \"I am the spirit, and I am the way,\" and when the prophet Muhammad said, \"Whoever has seen me has seen God,\" it is because they became so much an instrument of God, they became part of God's team \u2014 so that God's will was manifest through them, and they were not acting from their own selves and their own egos. Compassion on earth is given, it is in us. All we have to do is to get our egos out of the way, get our egotism out of the way.I'm sure, probably all of you here, or certainly the very vast majority of you, have had what you might call a spiritual experience, a moment in your lives when, for a few seconds, a minute perhaps, the boundaries of your ego dissolved. And at that minute, you felt at one with the universe \u2014 one with that jug of water, one with every human being, one with the Creator \u2014 and you felt you were in the presence of power, of awe, of the deepest love, the deepest sense of compassion and mercy that you have ever experienced in your lives.That is a moment which is a gift of God to us \u2014 a gift when, for a moment, he lifts that boundary which makes us insist on \"I, I, I, me, me, me,\" and instead, like the person in Rumi's story, we say, \"Oh, this is all you. This is all you. And this is all us. And us, and I, and us are all part of you. O, Creator! O, the Objective! The source of our being and the end of our journey, you are also the breaker of our hearts. You are the one whom we should all be towards, for whose purpose we live, and for whose purpose we shall die, and for whose purpose we shall be resurrected again to account to God to what extent we have been compassionate beings.\"Our message today, and our purpose today, and those of you who are here today, and the purpose of this charter of compassion, is to remind. For the Koran always urges us to remember, to remind each other, because the knowledge of truth is within every human being.We know it all. We have access to it all. Jung may have called it \"the subconscious.\" Through our subconscious, in your dreams \u2014 the Koran calls our state of sleep \"the lesser death,\" \"the temporary death\" \u2014 in our state of sleep we have dreams, we have visions, we travel even outside of our bodies, for many of us, and we see wonderful things. We travel beyond the limitations of space as we know it, and beyond the limitations of time as we know it. But all this is for us to glorify the name of the creator whose primary name is the compassionating, the compassionate.God, Bokh, whatever name you want to call him with, Allah, Ram, Om, whatever the name might be through which you name or access the presence of divinity, it is the locus of absolute being, absolute love and mercy and compassion, and absolute knowledge and wisdom, what Hindus call \"satchidananda.\" The language differs, but the objective is the same.Rumi has another story about three men, a Turk, an Arab and \u2014 and I forget the third person, but for my sake, it could be a Malay. One is asking for angur \u2014 one is, say, an Englishman \u2014 one is asking for eneb, and one is asking for grapes. And they have a fight and an argument because \u2014 \"I want grapes.\" \"I want eneb. \"I want angur.\" \u2014 not knowing that the word that they're using refers to the same reality in different languages.There's only one absolute reality by definition, one absolute being by definition, because absolute is, by definition, single, and absolute and singular. There's this absolute concentration of being, the absolute concentration of consciousness, awareness, an absolute locus of compassion and love that defines the primary attributes of divinity.And these should also be the primary attributes of what it means to be human. For what defines humanity, perhaps biologically, is our physiology, but God defines humanity by our spirituality, by our nature.And the Koran says, He speaks to the angels and says, \"When I have finished the formation of Adam from clay, and breathed into him of my spirit, then, fall in prostration to him.\" The angels prostrate, not before the human body, but before the human soul. Why? Because the soul, the human soul, embodies a piece of the divine breath, a piece of the divine soul.This is also expressed in biblical vocabulary when we are taught that we were created in the divine image. What is the imagery of God? The imagery of God is absolute being, absolute awareness and knowledge and wisdom and absolute compassion and love.And therefore, for us to be human \u2014 in the greatest sense of what it means to be human, in the most joyful sense of what it means to be human \u2014 means that we too have to be proper stewards of the breath of divinity within us, and seek to perfect within ourselves the attribute of being, of being alive, of beingness; the attribute of wisdom, of consciousness, of awareness; and the attribute of being compassionate and loving beings.This is what I understand from my faith tradition, and this is what I understand from my studies of other faith traditions, and this is the common platform on which we must all stand, and when we stand on this platform as such, I am convinced that we can make a wonderful world.And I believe, personally, that we're on the verge and that, with the presence and help of people like you here, we can bring about the prophecy of Isaiah. For he foretold of a period when people shall transform their swords into plowshares and will not learn war or make war anymore.We have reached a stage in human history that we have no option: we must, we must lower our egos, control our egos \u2014 whether it is individual ego, personal ego, family ego, national ego \u2014 and let all be for the glorification of the one.Thank you, and God bless you.

view,\n\n00:00:16.958 --> 00:00:19.958\nand perhaps my faith is not very well thought of\n\n00:00:19.958 --> 00:00:23.958\nas being one that is grounded in compassion.\n\n00:00:23.958 --> 00:00:25.958\nThe truth of the matter is otherwise.\n\n00:00:25.958 --> 00:00:31.958\nOur holy book, the Koran, consists of 114 chapters,\n\n00:00:31.958 --> 00:00:35.958\nand each chapter begins with what we call the basmala,\n\n00:00:35.958 --> 00:00:41.958\nthe saying of \"In the name of God, the all compassionate, the all merciful,\"\n\n00:00:41.958 --> 00:00:43.958\nor, as Sir Richard Burton --\n\n00:00:43.958 --> 00:00:46.958\nnot the Richard Burton who was married to Elizabeth Taylor,\n\n00:00:46.958 --> 00:00:49.958\nbut the Sir Richard Burton who lived a century before that\n\n00:00:49.958 --> 00:00:51.958\nand who was a worldwide traveler\n\n00:00:51.958 --> 00:00:55.958\nand translator of many works of literature --\n\n00:00:55.958 --> 00:01:02.958\ntranslates it. \"In the name of God, the compassionating, the compassionate.\"\n\n00:01:02.958 --> 00:01:09.958\nAnd in a saying of the Koran, which to Muslims is God speaking to humanity,\n\n00:01:09.958 --> 00:01:12.958\nGod says to his prophet Muhammad --\n\n00:01:12.958 --> 00:01:15.958\nwhom we believe to be the last of a series of prophets,\n\n00:01:15.958 --> 00:01:21.958\nbeginning with Adam, including Noah, including Moses, including Abraham,\n\n00:01:21.958 --> 00:01:25.958\nincluding Jesus Christ, and ending with Muhammad --\n\n00:01:25.958 --> 00:01:28.958\nthat, \"We have not sent you, O Muhammad,\n\n00:01:28.958 --> 00:01:34.958\nexcept as a 'rahmah,' except as a source of compassion to humanity.\"\n\n00:01:34.958 --> 00:01:38.958\nFor us human beings, and certainly for us as Muslims,\n\n00:01:38.958 --> 00:01:43.958\nwhose mission, and whose purpose in following the path of the prophet\n\n00:01:43.958 --> 00:01:47.958\nis to make ourselves as much like the prophet.\n\n00:01:47.958 --> 00:01:49.958\nAnd the prophet, in one of his sayings, said,\n\n00:01:49.958 --> 00:01:54.958\n\"Adorn yourselves with the attributes of God.\"\n\n00:01:54.958 --> 00:02:00.958\nAnd because God Himself said that the primary attribute of his is compassion --\n\n00:02:00.958 --> 00:02:05.958\nin fact, the Koran says that \"God decreed upon himself compassion,\"\n\n00:02:05.958 --> 00:02:09.958\nor, \"reigned himself in by compassion\" --\n\n00:02:09.958 --> 00:02:16.958\ntherefore, our objective and our mission must be to be sources of compassion,\n\n00:02:16.958 --> 00:02:20.958\nactivators of compassion, actors of compassion\n\n00:02:20.958 --> 00:02:24.958\nand speakers of compassion and doers of compassion.\n\n00:02:24.958 --> 00:02:27.958\nThat is all well and good,\n\n00:02:27.958 --> 00:02:30.958\nbut where do we go wrong,\n\n00:02:30.958 --> 00:02:35.958\nand what is the source of the lack of compassion in the world?\n\n00:02:35.958 --> 00:02:40.958\nFor the answer to this, we turn to our spiritual path.\n\n00:02:40.958 --> 00:02:47.958\nIn every religious tradition, there is the outer path and the inner path,\n\n00:02:47.958 --> 00:02:52.958\nor the exoteric path and the esoteric path.\n\n00:02:52.958 --> 00:03:00.958\nThe esoteric path of Islam is more popularly known as Sufism, or \"tasawwuf\" in Arabic.\n\n00:03:00.958 --> 00:03:03.958\nAnd these doctors or these masters,\n\n00:03:03.958 --> 00:03:07.958\nthese spiritual masters of the Sufi tradition,\n\n00:03:07.958 --> 00:03:11.958\nrefer to teachings and examples of our prophet\n\n00:03:11.958 --> 00:03:15.958\nthat teach us where the source of our problems lies.\n\n00:03:15.958 --> 00:03:19.958\nIn one of the battles that the prophet waged,\n\n00:03:19.958 --> 00:03:24.958\nhe told his followers, \"We are returning from the lesser war\n\n00:03:24.958 --> 00:03:28.958\nto the greater war, to the greater battle.\"\n\n00:03:28.958 --> 00:03:33.958\nAnd they said, \"Messenger of God, we are battle-weary.\n\n00:03:33.958 --> 00:03:36.958\nHow can we go to a greater battle?\"\n\n00:03:36.958 --> 00:03:44.958\nHe said, \"That is the battle of the self, the battle of the ego.\"\n\n00:03:44.958 --> 00:03:53.958\nThe sources of human problems have to do with egotism, \"I.\"\n\n00:03:53.958 --> 00:03:59.958\nThe famous Sufi master Rumi, who is very well known to most of you,\n\n00:03:59.958 --> 00:04:05.958\nhas a story in which he talks of a man who goes to the house of a friend,\n\n00:04:05.958 --> 00:04:08.958\nand he knocks on the door,\n\n00:04:08.958 --> 00:04:11.958\nand a voice answers, \"Who's there?\"\n\n00:04:11.958 --> 00:04:16.958\n\"It's me,\" or, more grammatically correctly, \"It is I,\"\n\n00:04:16.958 --> 00:04:18.958\nas we might say in English.\n\n00:04:18.958 --> 00:04:21.958\nThe voice says, \"Go away.\"\n\n00:04:21.958 --> 00:04:29.958\nAfter many years of training, of disciplining, of search and struggle,\n\n00:04:29.958 --> 00:04:31.958\nhe comes back.\n\n00:04:31.958 --> 00:04:35.958\nWith much greater humility, he knocks again on the door.\n\n00:04:35.958 --> 00:04:38.958\nThe voice asks, \"Who is there?\"\n\n00:04:38.958 --> 00:04:42.958\nHe said, \"It is you, O heartbreaker.\"\n\n00:04:42.958 --> 00:04:46.958\nThe door swings open, and the voice says,\n\n00:04:46.958 --> 00:04:53.958\n\"Come in, for there is no room in this house for two I's,\"\n\n00:04:53.958 --> 00:04:57.958\n-- two capital I's, not these eyes -- \"for two egos.\"\n\n00:04:57.958 --> 00:05:06.958\nAnd Rumi's stories are metaphors for the spiritual path.\n\n00:05:06.958 --> 00:05:12.958\nIn the presence of God, there is no room for more than one \"I,\"\n\n00:05:12.958 --> 00:05:17.958\nand that is the \"I\" of divinity.\n\n00:05:17.958 --> 00:05:21.958\nIn a teaching -- called a \"hadith qudsi\" in our tradition --\n\n00:05:21.958 --> 00:05:27.958\nGod says that, \"My servant,\" or \"My creature, my human creature,\n\n00:05:27.958 --> 00:05:33.958\ndoes not approach me by anything that is dearer to me\n\n00:05:33.958 --> 00:05:36.958\nthan what I have asked them to do.\"\n\n00:05:36.958 --> 00:05:40.958\nAnd those of you who are employers know exactly what I mean.\n\n00:05:40.958 --> 00:05:44.958\nYou want your employees to do what you ask them to do,\n\n00:05:44.958 --> 00:05:46.958\nand if they've done that, then they can do extra.\n\n00:05:46.958 --> 00:05:49.958\nBut don't ignore what you've asked them to do.\n\n00:05:49.958 --> 00:05:55.958\n\"And,\" God says, \"my servant continues to get nearer to me,\n\n00:05:55.958 --> 00:05:58.958\nby doing more of what I've asked them to do\" --\n\n00:05:58.958 --> 00:06:00.958\nextra credit, we might call it --\n\n00:06:00.958 --> 00:06:04.958\n\"until I love him or love her.\n\n00:06:04.958 --> 00:06:07.958\nAnd when I love my servant,\" God says,\n\n00:06:07.958 --> 00:06:13.958\n\"I become the eyes by which he or she sees,\n\n00:06:13.958 --> 00:06:19.958\nthe ears by which he or she listens,\n\n00:06:19.958 --> 00:06:24.958\nthe hand by which he or she grasps,\n\n00:06:24.958 --> 00:06:28.958\nand the foot by which he or she walks,\n\n00:06:28.958 --> 00:06:33.958\nand the heart by which he or she understands.\"\n\n00:06:33.958 --> 00:06:38.958\nIt is this merging of our self with divinity\n\n00:06:38.958 --> 00:06:46.958\nthat is the lesson and purpose of our spiritual path and all of our faith traditions.\n\n00:06:46.958 --> 00:06:52.958\nMuslims regard Jesus as the master of Sufism,\n\n00:06:52.958 --> 00:06:59.958\nthe greatest prophet and messenger who came to emphasize the spiritual path.\n\n00:06:59.958 --> 00:07:03.958\nWhen he says, \"I am the spirit, and I am the way,\"\n\n00:07:03.958 --> 00:07:08.958\nand when the prophet Muhammad said, \"Whoever has seen me has seen God,\"\n\n00:07:08.958 --> 00:07:13.958\nit is because they became so much an instrument of God,\n\n00:07:13.958 --> 00:07:15.958\nthey became part of God's team --\n\n00:07:15.958 --> 00:07:19.958\nso that God's will was manifest through them,\n\n00:07:19.958 --> 00:07:23.958\nand they were not acting from their own selves and their own egos.\n\n00:07:23.958 --> 00:07:30.958\nCompassion on earth is given, it is in us.\n\n00:07:30.958 --> 00:07:35.958\nAll we have to do is to get our egos out of the way,\n\n00:07:35.958 --> 00:07:38.958\nget our egotism out of the way.\n\n00:07:38.958 --> 00:07:46.958\nI'm sure, probably all of you here, or certainly the very vast majority of you,\n\n00:07:46.958 --> 00:07:50.958\nhave had what you might call a spiritual experience,\n\n00:07:50.958 --> 00:07:57.958\na moment in your lives when, for a few seconds, a minute perhaps,\n\n00:07:57.958 --> 00:08:03.958\nthe boundaries of your ego dissolved.\n\n00:08:03.958 --> 00:08:10.958\nAnd at that minute, you felt at one with the universe --\n\n00:08:10.958 --> 00:08:16.958\none with that jug of water, one with every human being,\n\n00:08:16.958 --> 00:08:20.958\none with the Creator --\n\n00:08:20.958 --> 00:08:25.958\nand you felt you were in the presence of power, of awe,\n\n00:08:25.958 --> 00:08:29.958\nof the deepest love, the deepest sense of compassion and mercy\n\n00:08:29.958 --> 00:08:33.958\nthat you have ever experienced in your lives.\n\n00:08:33.958 --> 00:08:39.958\nThat is a moment which is a gift of God to us --\n\n00:08:39.958 --> 00:08:43.958\na gift when, for a moment, he lifts that boundary\n\n00:08:43.958 --> 00:08:49.958\nwhich makes us insist on \"I, I, I, me, me, me,\"\n\n00:08:49.958 -->

He said, \"A human being is a part of the whole, called by us, the 'universe,' \u2014 a part limited in time and space. He experiences himself, his thoughts and feelings, as something separated from the rest, a kind of optical delusion of his consciousness. This delusion is a kind of prison for us, restricting us to our personal desires and to affection for a few persons nearest to us. Our task must be to free ourselves from this prison by widening our circle of compassion, to embrace all living creatures and the whole of nature in its beauty.\"This insight of Einstein's is uncannily close to that of Buddhist psychology, wherein compassion \u2014 \"karuna,\" it is called \u2014 is defined as, \"the sensitivity to another's suffering and the corresponding will to free the other from that suffering.\" It pairs closely with love, which is the will for the other to be happy, which requires, of course, that one feels some happiness oneself and wishes to share it. This is perfect in that it clearly opposes self-centeredness and selfishness to compassion, the concern for others, and, further, it indicates that those caught in the cycle of self-concern suffer helplessly, while the compassionate are more free and, implicitly, more happy.The Dalai Lama often states that compassion is his best friend. It helps him when he is overwhelmed with grief and despair. Compassion helps him turn away from the feeling of his suffering as the most absolute, most terrible suffering anyone has ever had and broadens his awareness of the sufferings of others, even of the perpetrators of his misery and the whole mass of beings. In fact, suffering is so huge and enormous, his own becomes less and less monumental. And he begins to move beyond his self-concern into the broader concern for others. And this immediately cheers him up, as his courage is stimulated to rise to the occasion. Thus, he uses his own suffering as a doorway to widening his circle of compassion. He is a very good colleague of Einstein's, we must say.Now, I want to tell a story, which is a very famous story in the Indian and Buddhist tradition, of the great Saint Asanga who was a contemporary of Augustine in the West and was sort of like the Buddhist Augustine. And Asanga lived 800 years after the Buddha's time. And he was discontented with the state of people's practice of the Buddhist religion in India at that time.And so he said, \"I'm sick of all this. Nobody's really living the doctrine. They're talking about love and compassion and wisdom and enlightenment, but they are acting selfish and pathetic. So, Buddha's teaching has lost its momentum. I know the next Buddha will come a few thousand years from now, but exists currently in a certain heaven\" \u2014 that's Maitreya \u2014 \"so, I'm going to go on a retreat and I'm going to meditate and pray until the Buddha Maitreya reveals himself to me, and gives me a teaching or something to revive the practice of compassion in the world today.\"So he went on this retreat. And he meditated for three years and he did not see the future Buddha Maitreya. And he left in disgust. And as he was leaving, he saw a man \u2014 a funny little man sitting sort of part way down the mountain. And he had a lump of iron. And he was rubbing it with a cloth. And he became interested in that. He said, \"Well what are you doing?\" And the man said, \"I'm making a needle.\" And he said, \"That's ridiculous. You can't make a needle by rubbing a lump of iron with a cloth.\" And the man said, \"Really?\" And he showed him a dish full of needles. So he said, \"Okay, I get the point.\" He went back to his cave. He meditated again.Another three years, no vision. He leaves again. This time, he comes down. And as he's leaving, he sees a bird making a nest on a cliff ledge. And where it's landing to bring the twigs to the cliff, its feathers brushes the rock \u2014 and it had cut the rock six to eight inches in. There was a cleft in the rock by the brushing of the feathers of generations of the birds. So he said, \"All right. I get the point.\" He went back.Another three years. Again, no vision of Maitreya after nine years. And he again leaves, and this time: water dripping, making a giant bowl in the rock where it drips in a stream. And so, again, he goes back. And after 12 years there is still no vision. And he's freaked out. And he won't even look left or right to see any encouraging vision.And he comes to the town. He's a broken person. And there, in the town, he's approached by a dog who comes like this \u2014 one of these terrible dogs you can see in some poor countries, even in America, I think, in some areas \u2014 and he's looking just terrible. And he becomes interested in this dog because it's so pathetic, and it's trying to attract his attention. And he sits down looking at the dog. And the dog's whole hindquarters are a complete open sore. Some of it is like gangrenous, and there are maggots in the flesh. And it's terrible. He thinks, \"What can I do to fix up this dog? Well, at least I can clean this wound and wash it.\"So, he takes it to some water. He's about to clean, but then his awareness focuses on the maggots. And he sees the maggots, and the maggots are kind of looking a little cute. And they're maggoting happily in the dog's hindquarters there. \"Well, if I clean the dog, I'll kill the maggots. So how can that be? That's it. I'm a useless person and there's no Buddha, no Maitreya, and everything is all hopeless. And now I'm going to kill the maggots?\"So, he had a brilliant idea. And he took a shard of something, and cut a piece of flesh from his thigh, and he placed it on ground. He was not really thinking too carefully about the ASPCA. He was just immediately caught with the situation. So he thought, \"I will take the maggots and put them on this piece of flesh, then clean the dog's wounds, and then I'll figure out what to do with the maggots.\"So he starts to do that. He can't grab the maggots. Apparently they wriggle around. They're kind of hard to grab, these maggots. So he says, \"Well, I'll put my tongue on the dog's flesh. And then the maggots will jump on my warmer tongue\" \u2014 the dog is kind of used up \u2014 \"and then I'll spit them one by one down on the thing.\" So he goes down, and he's sticking his tongue out like this. And he had to close his eyes, it's so disgusting, and the smell and everything.And then, suddenly, there's a pfft, a noise like that. He jumps back and there, of course, is the future Buddha Maitreya in a beautiful vision \u2014 rainbow lights, golden, jeweled, a plasma body, an exquisite mystic vision \u2014 that he sees. And he says, \"Oh.\" He bows. But, being human, he's immediately thinking of his next complaint.So as he comes up from his first bow he says, \"My Lord, I'm so happy to see you, but where have you been for 12 years? What is this?\"And Maitreya says, \"I was with you. Who do you think was making needles and making nests and dripping on rocks for you, mister dense?\" (Laughter) \"Looking for the Buddha in person,\" he said. And he said, \"You didn't have, until this moment, real compassion. And, until you have real compassion, you cannot recognize love.\" \"Maitreya\" means love, \"the loving one,\" in Sanskrit.And so he looked very dubious, Asanga did. And he said, \"If you don't believe me, just take me with you.\" And so he took the Maitreya \u2014 it shrunk into a globe, a ball \u2014 took him on his shoulder. And he ran into town in the marketplace, and he said, \"Rejoice! Rejoice! The future Buddha has come ahead of all predictions. Here he is.\" And then pretty soon they started throwing rocks and stones at him \u2014 it wasn't Chautauqua, it was some other town \u2014 because they saw a demented looking, scrawny looking yogi man, like some kind of hippie, with a bleeding leg and a rotten dog on his shoulder, shouting that the future Buddha had come.So, naturally, they chased him out of town. But on the edge of town, one elderly lady, a charwoman in the charnel ground, saw a jeweled foot on a jeweled lotus on his shoulder and then the dog, but she saw the jewel foot of the Maitreya, and she offered a flower. So that encouraged him, and he went with Maitreya.Maitreya then took him to a certain heaven, which is the typical way a Buddhist myth unfolds. And Maitreya then kept him in heaven for five years, dictating to him five complicated tomes of the methodology of how you cultivate compassion.And then I thought I would share with you what that method is, or one of them. A famous one, it's called the \"Sevenfold Causal Method of Developing Compassion.\" And it begins first by one meditating and visualizing that all beings are with one \u2014 even animals too, but everyone is in human form. The animals are in one of their human lives. The humans are human. And then, among them, you think of your friends and loved ones, the circle at the table. And you think of your enemies, and you think of the neutral ones. And then you try to say, \"Well, the loved ones I love. But, you know, after all, they're nice to me. I had fights with them. Sometimes they were unfriendly. I got mad. Brothers can fight. Parents and children can fight. So, in a way, I like them so much because they're nice to me. While the neutral ones I don't know. They could all be just fine. And then the enemies I don't like because they're mean to me. But they are nice to somebody. I could be them.\"And then the Buddhists, of course, think that, because we've all had infinite previous lives, we've all been each other's relatives, actually. Therefore all of you, in the Buddhist view, in some previous life, although you don't remember it and neither do I, have been my mother \u2014 for which I do apologize for the trouble I caused you. And also, actually, I've been your mother. I've been female, and I've been every single one of yours' mother in a previous life, the way the Buddhists reflect. So, my mother in this life is really great. But all of you in a way are part of the eternal mother. You gave me that expression; \"the eternal mama,\" you said. That's wonderful. So, that's the way the Buddhists do it. A theist Christian can think that all beings, even my enemies, are God's children. So, in that sense, we're related.So, they first create this foundation of equality. So, we sort of reduce a little of the clinging to the ones we love \u2014 just in the meditation \u2014 and we open our mind to those we don't know. And we definitely reduce the hostility and the \"I don't want to be compassionate to them\" to the ones we think of as the bad guys, the ones we hate and we don't like. And we don't hate anyone, therefore. So we equalize. That's very important.And then the next thing we do is what is called \"mother recognition.\" And that is, we think of every being as familiar, as family. We expand. We take the feeling about remembering a mama, and we defuse that to all beings in this meditation. And we see the mother in every being. We see that look that the mother has on her face, looking at this child that is a miracle that she has produced from her own body, being a mammal, where she has true compassion, truly is the other, and identifies completely. Often the life of that other will be more important to her than her own life. And that's why it's the most powerful form of altruism. The mother is the model of all altruism for human beings, in spiritual traditions. And so, we reflect until we can sort of see that motherly expression in all beings.People laugh at me because, you know, I used to say that I used to meditate on mama Cheney as my mom, when, of course, I was annoyed with him about all of his evil doings in Iraq. I used to meditate on George Bush. He's quite a cute mom in a female form. He has his little ears and he smiles and he rocks you in his arms. And you think of him as nursing you. And then Saddam Hussein's serious mustache is a problem, but you think of him as a mom.And this is the way you do it. You take any being who looks weird to you, and you see how they could be familiar to you. And you do that for a while, until you really feel that. You can feel the familiarity of all beings. Nobody seems alien. They're not \"other.\" You reduce the feeling of otherness about beings. Then you move from there to remembering the kindness of mothers in general, if you can remember the kindness of your own mother, if you can remember the kindness of your spouse, or, if you are a mother yourself, how you were with your children. And you begin to get very sentimental; you cultivate sentimentality intensely. You will even weep, perhaps, with gratitude and kindness. And then you connect that with your feeling that everyone has that motherly possibility. Every being, even the most mean looking ones, can be motherly.And then, third, you step from there to what is called \"a feeling of gratitude.\" You want to repay that kindness that all beings have shown to you. And then the fourth step, you go to what is called \"lovely love.\" In each one of these you can take some weeks, or months, or days depending on how you do it, or you can do them in a run, this meditation. And then you think of how lovely beings are when they are happy, when they are satisfied. And every being looks beautiful when they are internally feeling a happiness. Their face doesn't look like this. When they're angry, they look ugly, every being, but when they're happy they look beautiful. And so you see beings in their potential happiness. And you feel a love toward them and you want them to be happy, even the enemy.We think Jesus is being unrealistic when he says, \"Love thine enemy.\" He does say that, and we think he's being unrealistic and sort of spiritual and highfalutin. \"Nice for him to say it, but I can't do that.\" But, actually, that's practical. If you love your enemy that means you want your enemy to be happy. If your enemy was really happy, why would they bother to be your enemy? How boring to run around chasing you. They would be relaxing somewhere having a good time. So it makes sense to want your enemy to be happy, because they'll stop being your enemy because that's too much trouble.But anyway, that's the \"lovely love. \" And then finally, the fifth step is compassion, \"universal compassion.\" And that is where you then look at the reality of all the beings you can think of. And you look at them, and you see how they are. And you realize how unhappy they are actually, mostly, most of the time. You see that furrowed brow in people. And then you realize they don't even have compassion on themselves. They're driven by this duty and this obligation. \"I have to get that. I need more. I'm not worthy. And I should do something.\" And they're rushing around all stressed out. And they think of it as somehow macho, hard discipline on themselves. But actually they are cruel to themselves. And, of course, they are cruel and ruthless toward others. And they, then, never get any positive feedback. And the more they succeed and the more power they have, the more unhappy they are. And this is where you feel real compassion for them.And you then feel you must act. And the choice of the action, of course, hopefully will be more practical than poor Asanga, who was fixing the maggots on the dog because he had that motivation, and whoever was in front of him, he wanted to help. But, of course, that is impractical. He should have founded the ASPCA in the town and gotten some scientific help for dogs and maggots. And I'm sure he did that later. (Laughter) But that just indicates the state of mind, you know.And so the next step \u2014 the sixth step beyond \"universal compassion\" \u2014 is this thing where you're linked with the needs of others in a true way, and you have compassion for yourself also, and it isn't sentimental only. You might be in fear of something. Some bad guy is making himself more and more unhappy being more and more mean to other people and getting punished in the future for it in various ways. And in Buddhism, they catch it in the future life. Of course in theistic religion they're punished by God or whatever. And materialism, they think they get out of it just by not existing, by dying, but they don't. And so they get reborn as whatever, you know.Never mind. I won't get into that. But the next step is called \"universal responsibility.\" And that is very important \u2014 the Charter of Compassion must lead us to develop through true compassion, what is called \"universal responsibility.\" In the great teaching of his Holiness the Dalai Lama that he always teaches everywhere, he says that that is the common religion of humanity: kindness. But \"kindness\" means \"universal responsibility.\" And that means whatever happens to other beings is happening to us: we are responsible for that, and we should take it and do whatever we can at whatever little level and small level that we can do it. We absolutely must do that. There is no way not to do it.And then, finally, that leads to a new orientation in life where we live equally for ourselves and for others and we are joyful and happy. One thing we mustn't think is that compassion makes you miserable. Compassion makes you happy. The first person who is happy when you get great compassion is yourself, even if you haven't done anything yet for anybody else. Although, the change in your mind already does something for other beings: they can sense this new quality in yourself, and it helps them already, and gives them an example.And that uncompassionate clock has just showed me that it's all over.So, practice compassion, read the charter, disseminate it and develop it within yourself. Don't just think, \"Well, I'm compassionate,\" or \"I'm not compassionate,\" and sort of think you're stuck there. You can develop this. You can diminish the non-compassion, the cruelty, the callousness, the neglect of others, and take universal responsibility for them. And then, not only will God smile and the eternal mama will smile, but Karen Armstrong will smile.Thank you very much.

Nobody's really living the doctrine.\n\n00:03:05.958 --> 00:03:08.958\nThey're talking about love and compassion and wisdom and enlightenment,\n\n00:03:08.958 --> 00:03:11.958\nbut they are acting selfish and pathetic.\n\n00:03:11.958 --> 00:03:14.958\nSo, Buddha's teaching has lost its momentum.\n\n00:03:14.958 --> 00:03:17.958\nI know the next Buddha will come a few thousand years from now,\n\n00:03:17.958 --> 00:03:21.958\nbut exists currently in a certain heaven\" -- that's Maitreya --\n\n00:03:21.958 --> 00:03:24.958\n\"so, I'm going to go on a retreat and I'm going to meditate\n\n00:03:24.958 --> 00:03:28.958\nand pray until the Buddha Maitreya reveals himself to me,\n\n00:03:28.958 --> 00:03:30.958\nand gives me a teaching or something\n\n00:03:30.958 --> 00:03:34.958\nto revive the practice of compassion in the world today.\"\n\n00:03:34.958 --> 00:03:37.958\nSo he went on this retreat. And he meditated for three years\n\n00:03:37.958 --> 00:03:39.958\nand he did not see the future Buddha Maitreya.\n\n00:03:39.958 --> 00:03:42.958\nAnd he left in disgust.\n\n00:03:42.958 --> 00:03:45.958\nAnd as he was leaving, he saw a man --\n\n00:03:45.958 --> 00:03:48.958\na funny little man sitting sort of part way down the mountain.\n\n00:03:48.958 --> 00:03:51.958\nAnd he had a lump of iron.\n\n00:03:51.958 --> 00:03:53.958\nAnd he was rubbing it with a cloth.\n\n00:03:53.958 --> 00:03:55.958\nAnd he became interested in that.\n\n00:03:55.958 --> 00:03:57.958\nHe said, \"Well what are you doing?\"\n\n00:03:57.958 --> 00:04:02.958\nAnd the man said, \"I'm making a needle.\"\n\n00:04:02.958 --> 00:04:04.958\nAnd he said, \"That's ridiculous. You can't make a needle\n\n00:04:04.958 --> 00:04:06.958\nby rubbing a lump of iron with a cloth.\"\n\n00:04:06.958 --> 00:04:09.958\nAnd the man said, \"Really?\" And he showed him a dish full of needles.\n\n00:04:09.958 --> 00:04:11.958\nSo he said, \"Okay, I get the point.\"\n\n00:04:11.958 --> 00:04:14.958\nHe went back to his cave. He meditated again.\n\n00:04:14.958 --> 00:04:17.958\nAnother three years, no vision. He leaves again.\n\n00:04:17.958 --> 00:04:19.958\nThis time, he comes down.\n\n00:04:19.958 --> 00:04:23.958\nAnd as he's leaving, he sees a bird making a nest on a cliff ledge.\n\n00:04:23.958 --> 00:04:27.958\nAnd where it's landing to bring the twigs to the cliff,\n\n00:04:27.958 --> 00:04:31.958\nits feathers brushes the rock -- and it had cut the rock\n\n00:04:31.958 --> 00:04:34.958\nsix to eight inches in. There was a cleft in the rock\n\n00:04:34.958 --> 00:04:37.958\nby the brushing of the feathers of generations of the birds.\n\n00:04:37.958 --> 00:04:39.958\nSo he said, \"All right. I get the point.\" He went back.\n\n00:04:39.958 --> 00:04:41.958\nAnother three years.\n\n00:04:41.958 --> 00:04:43.958\nAgain, no vision of Maitreya after nine years.\n\n00:04:43.958 --> 00:04:46.958\nAnd he again leaves, and this time: water dripping,\n\n00:04:46.958 --> 00:04:50.958\nmaking a giant bowl in the rock where it drips in a stream.\n\n00:04:50.958 --> 00:04:54.958\nAnd so, again, he goes back. And after 12 years there is still no vision.\n\n00:04:54.958 --> 00:04:56.958\nAnd he's freaked out. And he won't even look left or right\n\n00:04:56.958 --> 00:04:58.958\nto see any encouraging vision.\n\n00:04:58.958 --> 00:05:01.958\nAnd he comes to the town. He's a broken person.\n\n00:05:01.958 --> 00:05:04.958\nAnd there, in the town, he's approached by a dog\n\n00:05:04.958 --> 00:05:09.958\nwho comes like this -- one of these terrible dogs you can see in some poor countries,\n\n00:05:09.958 --> 00:05:11.958\neven in America, I think, in some areas --\n\n00:05:11.958 --> 00:05:13.958\nand he's looking just terrible.\n\n00:05:13.958 --> 00:05:16.958\nAnd he becomes interested in this dog because it's so pathetic,\n\n00:05:16.958 --> 00:05:19.958\nand it's trying to attract his attention. And he sits down looking at the dog.\n\n00:05:19.958 --> 00:05:24.958\nAnd the dog's whole hindquarters are a complete open sore.\n\n00:05:24.958 --> 00:05:26.958\nSome of it is like gangrenous,\n\n00:05:26.958 --> 00:05:29.958\nand there are maggots in the flesh. And it's terrible.\n\n00:05:29.958 --> 00:05:32.958\nHe thinks, \"What can I do to fix up this dog?\n\n00:05:32.958 --> 00:05:35.958\nWell, at least I can clean this wound and wash it.\"\n\n00:05:35.958 --> 00:05:37.958\nSo, he takes it to some water. He's about to clean,\n\n00:05:37.958 --> 00:05:41.958\nbut then his awareness focuses on the maggots.\n\n00:05:41.958 --> 00:05:44.958\nAnd he sees the maggots, and the maggots are kind of looking a little cute.\n\n00:05:44.958 --> 00:05:47.958\nAnd they're maggoting happily in the dog's hindquarters there.\n\n00:05:47.958 --> 00:05:51.958\n\"Well, if I clean the dog, I'll kill the maggots. So how can that be?\n\n00:05:51.958 --> 00:05:54.958\nThat's it. I'm a useless person and there's no Buddha, no Maitreya,\n\n00:05:54.958 --> 00:05:56.958\nand everything is all hopeless.\n\n00:05:56.958 --> 00:05:59.958\nAnd now I'm going to kill the maggots?\"\n\n00:05:59.958 --> 00:06:01.958\nSo, he had a brilliant idea.\n\n00:06:01.958 --> 00:06:06.958\nAnd he took a shard of something, and cut a piece of flesh from his thigh,\n\n00:06:06.958 --> 00:06:08.958\nand he placed it on ground.\n\n00:06:08.958 --> 00:06:12.958\nHe was not really thinking too carefully about the ASPCA.\n\n00:06:12.958 --> 00:06:14.958\nHe was just immediately caught with the situation.\n\n00:06:14.958 --> 00:06:17.958\nSo he thought, \"I will take the maggots and put them on this piece of flesh,\n\n00:06:17.958 --> 00:06:20.958\nthen clean the dog's wounds, and then\n\n00:06:20.958 --> 00:06:23.958\nI'll figure out what to do with the maggots.\"\n\n00:06:23.958 --> 00:06:25.958\nSo he starts to do that. He can't grab the maggots.\n\n00:06:25.958 --> 00:06:29.958\nApparently they wriggle around. They're kind of hard to grab, these maggots.\n\n00:06:29.958 --> 00:06:33.958\nSo he says, \"Well, I'll put my tongue on the dog's flesh.\n\n00:06:33.958 --> 00:06:35.958\nAnd then the maggots will jump on my warmer tongue\" --\n\n00:06:35.958 --> 00:06:37.958\nthe dog is kind of used up --\n\n00:06:37.958 --> 00:06:40.958\n\"and then I'll spit them one by one down on the thing.\"\n\n00:06:40.958 --> 00:06:43.958\nSo he goes down, and he's sticking his tongue out like this.\n\n00:06:43.958 --> 00:06:48.958\nAnd he had to close his eyes, it's so disgusting, and the smell and everything.\n\n00:06:48.958 --> 00:06:50.958\nAnd then, suddenly, there's a pfft, a noise like that.\n\n00:06:50.958 --> 00:06:54.958\nHe jumps back and there, of course, is the future Buddha Maitreya\n\n00:06:54.958 --> 00:07:01.958\nin a beautiful vision -- rainbow lights, golden, jeweled, a plasma body,\n\n00:07:01.958 --> 00:07:03.958\nan exquisite mystic vision -- that he sees.\n\n00:07:03.958 --> 00:07:05.958\nAnd he says, \"Oh.\" He bows.\n\n00:07:05.958 --> 00:07:09.958\nBut, being human, he's immediately thinking of his next complaint.\n\n00:07:09.958 --> 00:07:11.958\nSo as he comes up from his first bow he says,\n\n00:07:11.958 --> 00:07:15.958\n\"My Lord, I'm so happy to see you, but where have you been for 12 years?\n\n00:07:15.958 --> 00:07:17.958\nWhat is this?\"\n\n00:07:17.958 --> 00:07:20.958\nAnd Maitreya says, \"I was with you. Who do you think was making needles\n\n00:07:20.958 --> 00:07:24.958\nand making nests and dripping on rocks for you, mister dense?\"\n\n00:07:24.958 --> 00:07:26.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:07:26.958 --> 00:07:29.958\n\"Looking for the Buddha in person,\" he said.\n\n00:07:29.958 --> 00:07:35.958\nAnd he said, \"You didn't have, until this moment, real compassion.\n\n00:07:35.958 --> 00:07:38.958\nAnd, until you have real compassion, you cannot recognize love.\"\n\n00:07:38.958 --> 00:07:42.958\n\"Maitreya\" means love, \"the loving one,\" in Sanskrit.\n\n00:07:42.958 --> 00:07:44.958\nAnd so he looked very dubious, Asanga did.\n\n00:07:44.958 --> 00:07:47.958\nAnd he said, \"If you don't believe me, just take me with you.\"\n\n00:07:47.958 --> 00:07:52.958\nAnd so he took the Maitreya -- it shrunk into a globe, a ball --\n\n00:07:52.958 --> 00:07:54.958\ntook him on his shoulder.\n\n00:07:54.958 --> 00:07:58.958\nAnd he ran into town in the marketplace, and he said, \"Rejoice! Rejoice!\n\n00:07:58.958 --> 00:08:02.958\nThe future Buddha has come ahead of all predictions. Here he is.\"\n\n00:08:02.958 --> 00:08:05.958\nAnd then pretty soon they started throwing rocks and stones at him --\n\n00:08:05.958 --> 00:08:08.958\nit wasn't Chautauqua, it was some other town --\n\n00:08:08.958 --> 00:08:12.958\nbecause they saw a demented looking, scrawny looking yogi man,\n\n00:08:12.958 --> 00:08:17.958\nlike some kind of hippie, with a bleeding leg and a rotten dog on his shoulder,\n\n00:08:17.958 --> 00:08:19.958\nshouting that the future Buddha had come.\n\n00:08:19.958 --> 00:08:21.958\nSo, naturally, they chased him out of town.\n\n00:08:21.958 --> 00:08:26.958\nBut on the edge of town, one elderly lady, a charwoman in the charnel ground,\n\n00:08:26.958 --> 00:08:30.958\nsaw a jeweled foot on a jeweled lotus on his shoulder and then the dog,\n\n00:08:30.958 --> 00:08:34.958\nbut she saw the jewel foot of the Maitreya, and she offered a flower.\n\n00:08:34.958 --> 00:08:37.958\nSo that encouraged him, and he went with Maitreya.\n\n00:08:37.958 --> 00:08:39.958\nMaitreya then took him to a certain heaven,\n\n00:08:39.958 --> 00:08:42.958\nwhich is the typical way a Buddhist myth unfolds.\n\n00:08:42.958 --> 00:08:44.958\nAnd Maitreya then kept him in heaven for five years,\n\n00:08:44.958 --> 00:08:48.958\ndictating to him five complicated tomes\n\n00:08:48.958 --> 00:08:51.958\nof the methodology of how you cultivate compassion.\n\n00:08:51.958 --> 00:08:54.958\nAnd then I thought I would share with you what that method is, or one of them.\n\n00:08:54.958 --> 00:08:59.958\nA famous one, it's called the \"Sevenfold Causal Method of Developing Compassion.\"\n\n00:08:59.958 --> 00:09:06.958\nAnd it begins first by one meditating and visualizing that all beings are with one --\n\n00:09:06.958 --> 00:09:10.958\neven animals too, but everyone is in human form.\n\n00:09:10.958 --> 00:09:13.958\nThe animals are in one of their human lives. The humans are human.\n\n00:09:13.958 --> 00:09:18.958\nAnd then, among them, you think of your friends and loved ones, the circle at the table.\n\n00:09:18.958 --> 00:09:21.958\nAnd you think of your enemies, and you think of the neutral ones.\n\n00:09:21.958 --> 00:09:25.958\nAnd then you try to say, \"Well, the loved ones I love.\n\n00:09:25.958 --> 00:09:27.958\nBut, you know, after all, they're nice to me.\n\n00:09:27.958 --> 00:09:29.958\nI had fights with them. Sometimes they were unfriendly.\n\n00:09:29.958 --> 00:09:32.958\nI got mad. Brothers can fight. Parents and children can fight.\n\n00:09:32.958 --> 00:09:36.958\nSo, in a way, I like them so much because they're nice to me.\n\n00:09:36.958 --> 00:09:40.958\nWhile the neutral ones I don't know. They could all be just fine.\n\n00:09:40.958 --> 00:09:44.958\nAnd then the enemies I don't like because they're mean to me.\n\n00:09:44.958 --> 00:09:47.958\nBut they are nice to somebody. I could be them.\"\n\n00:09:47.958 --> 00:09:51.958\nAnd then the Buddhists, of course, think that, because we've all had infinite previous lives,\n\n00:09:51.958 --> 00:09:55.958\nwe've all been each other's relatives, actually.\n\n00:09:55.958 --> 00:09:57.958\nTherefore all of you, in the Buddhist view,\n\n00:09:57.958 --> 00:10:01.958\nin some previous life, although you don't remember it and neither do I,\n\n00:10:01.958 --> 00:10:06.958\nhave been my mother -- for which I do apologize for the trouble I caused you.\n\n00:10:06.958 --> 00:10:09.958\nAnd also, actually, I've been your mother.\n\n00:10:09.958 --> 00:10:12.958\nI've been female, and I've been every single one of yours' mother in a previous life,\n\n00:10:12.958 --> 00:10:14.958\nthe way the Buddhists reflect.\n\n00:10:14.958 --> 00:10:17.958\nSo, my mother in this life is really great. But all of you in a way\n\n00:10:17.958 --> 00:10:20.958\nare part of the eternal mother.\n\n00:10:20.958 --> 00:10:24.958\nYou gave me that expression; \"the eternal mama,\" you said. That's wonderful.\n\n00:10:24.958 --> 00:10:26.958\nSo, that's the way the Buddhists do it.\n\n00:10:26.958 --> 00:10:31.958\nA theist Christian can think that all beings, even my enemies, are God's children.\n\n00:10:31.958 --> 00:10:33.958\nSo, in that sense, we're related.\n\n00:10:33.958 --> 00:10:36.958\nSo, they first create this foundation of equality.\n\n00:10:36.958 --> 00:10:40.958\nSo, we sort of reduce a little of the clinging to the ones we love --\n\n00:10:40.958 --> 00:10:44.958\njust in the meditation -- and we open our mind to those we don't know.\n\n00:10:44.958 --> 00:10:48.958\nAnd we definitely reduce the hostility and the \"I don't want to be compassionate to them\"\n\n00:10:48.958 --> 00:10:53.958\nto the ones we think of as the bad guys, the ones we hate and we don't like.\n\n00:10:53.958 --> 00:10:56.958\nAnd we don't hate anyone, therefore. So we equalize. That's very important.\n\n00:10:56.958 --> 00:11:00.958\nAnd then the next thing we do is what is called \"mother recognition.\"\n\n00:11:00.958 --> 00:11:05.958\nAnd that is, we think of every being as familiar, as family.\n\n00:11:05.958 --> 00:11:10.958\nWe expand. We take the feeling about remembering a mama,\n\n00:11:10.958 --> 00:11:14.958\nand we defuse that to all beings in this meditation.\n\n00:11:14.958 --> 00:11:16.958\nAnd we see the mother in every being.\n\n00:11:16.958 --> 00:11:19.958\nWe see that look that the mother has on her face,\n\n00:11:19.958 --> 00:11:21.958\nlooking at this child that is a miracle\n\n00:11:21.958 --> 00:11:24.958\nthat she has produced from her own body, being a mammal,\n\n00:11:24.958 --> 00:11:28.958\nwhere she has true compassion, truly is the other, and identifies completely.\n\n00:11:28.958 --> 00:11:32.958\nOften the life of that other will be more important to her than her own life.\n\n00:11:32.958 --> 00:11:35.958\nAnd that's why it's the most powerful form of altruism.\n\n00:11:35.958 --> 00:11:39.958\nThe mother is the model of all altruism for human beings,\n\n00:11:39.958 --> 00:11:42.958\nin spiritual traditions.\n\n00:11:42.958 --> 00:11:48.958\nAnd so, we reflect until we can sort of see that motherly expression in all beings.\n\n00:11:48.958 --> 00:11:51.958\nPeople laugh at me because, you know, I used to say that\n\n00:11:51.958 --> 00:11:55.958\nI used to meditate on mama Cheney as my mom,\n\n00:11:55.958 --> 00:12:00.958\nwhen, of course, I was annoyed with him about all of his evil doings in Iraq.\n\n00:12:00.958 --> 00:12:03.958\nI used to meditate on George Bush. He's quite a cute mom in a female form.\n\n00:12:03.958 --> 00:12:06.958\nHe has his little ears and he smiles and he rocks you in his arms.\n\n00:12:06.958 --> 00:12:09.958\nAnd you think of him as nursing you.\n\n00:12:09.958 --> 00:12:12.958\nAnd then Saddam Hussein's serious mustache is a problem,\n\n00:12:12.958 --> 00:12:15.958\nbut you think of him as a mom.\n\n00:12:15.958 --> 00:12:17.958\nAnd this is the way you do it. You take any being who looks weird to you,\n\n00:12:17.958 --> 00:12:21.958\nand you see how they could be familiar to you.\n\n00:12:21.958 --> 00:12:25.958\nAnd you do that for a while, until you really feel that.\n\n00:12:25.958 --> 00:12:27.958\nYou can feel the familiarity of all beings.\n\n00:12:27.958 --> 00:12:29.958\nNobody seems alien. They're not \"other.\"\n\n00:12:29.958 --> 00:12:32.958\nYou reduce the feeling of otherness about beings.\n\n00:12:32.958 --> 00:12:37.958\nThen you move from there to remembering the kindness of mothers in general,\n\n00:12:37.958 --> 00:12:39.958\nif you can remember the kindness of your own mother,\n\n00:12:39.958 --> 00:12:41.958\nif you can remember the kindness of your spouse,\n\n00:12:41.958 --> 00:12:44.958\nor, if you are a mother yourself, how you were with your children.\n\n00:12:44.958 --> 00:12:49.958\nAnd you begin to get very sentimental; you cultivate sentimentality intensely.\n\n00:12:49.958 --> 00:12:52.958\nYou will even weep, perhaps, with gratitude and kindness.\n\n00:12:52.958 --> 00:12:56.958\nAnd then you connect that with your feeling that everyone has that motherly possibility.\n\n00:12:56.958 --> 00:13:01.958\nEvery being, even the most mean looking ones, can be motherly.\n\n00:13:01.958 --> 00:13:05.958\nAnd then, third, you step from there to what is called \"a feeling of gratitude.\"\n\n00:13:05.958 --> 00:13:09.958\nYou want to repay that kindness that all beings have shown to you.\n\n00:13:09.958 --> 00:13:13.958\nAnd then the fourth step, you go to what is called \"lovely love.\"\n\n00:13:13.958 --> 00:13:15.958\nIn each one of these you can take some weeks, or months, or days\n\n00:13:15.958 --> 00:13:19.958\ndepending on how you do it, or you can do them in a run, this meditation.\n\n00:13:19.958 --> 00:13:24.958\nAnd then you think of how lovely beings are when they are happy,\n\n00:13:24.958 --> 00:13:26.958\nwhen they are satisfied.\n\n00:13:26.958 --> 00:13:30.958\nAnd every being looks beautiful when they are internally feeling a happiness.\n\n00:13:30.958 --> 00:13:34.958\nTheir face doesn't look like this. When they're angry, they look ugly, every being,\n\n00:13:34.958 --> 00:13:36.958\nbut when they're happy they look beautiful.\n\n00:13:36.958 --> 00:13:39.958\nAnd so you see beings in their potential happiness.\n\n00:13:39.958 --> 00:13:42.958\nAnd you feel a love toward them and you want them to be happy, even the enemy.\n\n00:13:42.958 --> 00:13:44.958\nWe think Jesus is being unrealistic\n\n00:13:44.958 --> 00:13:48.958\nwhen he says, \"Love thine enemy.\"\n\n00:13:48.958 --> 00:13:51.958\nHe does say that, and we think he's being unrealistic\n\n00:13:51.958 --> 00:13:54.958\nand sort of spiritual and highfalutin. \"Nice for him to say it, but I can't do that.\"\n\n00:13:54.958 --> 00:13:56.958\nBut, actually, that's practical.\n\n00:13:56.958 --> 00:13:59.958\nIf you love your enemy that means you want your enemy to be happy.\n\n00:13:59.958 --> 00:14:03.958\nIf your enemy was really happy, why would they bother to be your enemy?\n\n00:14:03.958 --> 00:14:05.958\nHow boring to run around chasing you.\n\n00:14:05.958 --> 00:14:08.958\nThey would be relaxing somewhere having a good time.\n\n00:14:08.958 --> 00:14:10.958\nSo it makes sense to want your enemy to be happy,\n\n00:14:10.958 --> 00:14:13.958\nbecause they'll stop being your enemy because that's too much trouble.\n\n00:14:13.958 --> 00:14:15.958\nBut anyway, that's the \"lovely love. \"\n\n00:14:15.958 --> 00:14:19.958\nAnd then finally, the fifth step is compassion, \"universal compassion.\"\n\n00:14:19.958 --> 00:14:25.958\nAnd that is where you then look at the reality of all the beings you can think of.\n\n00:14:25.958 --> 00:14:27.958\nAnd you look at them, and you see how they are.\n\n00:14:27.958 --> 00:14:31.958\nAnd you realize how unhappy they are actually, mostly, most of the time.\n\n00:14:31.958 --> 00:14:33.958\nYou see that furrowed brow in people.\n\n00:14:33.958 --> 00:14:36.958\nAnd then you realize they don't even have compassion on themselves.\n\n00:14:36.958 --> 00:14:38.958\nThey're driven by this duty and this obligation.\n\n00:14:38.958 --> 00:14:42.958\n\"I have to get that. I need more. I'm not worthy. And I should do something.\"\n\n00:14:42.958 --> 00:14:44.958\nAnd they're rushing around all stressed out.\n\n00:14:44.958 --> 00:14:48.958\nAnd they think of it as somehow macho, hard discipline on themselves.\n\n00:14:48.958 --> 00:14:51.958\nBut actually they are cruel to themselves.\n\n00:14:51.958 --> 00:14:53.958\nAnd, of course, they are cruel and ruthless toward others.\n\n00:14:53.958 --> 00:14:55.958\nAnd they, then, never get any positive feedback.\n\n00:14:55.958 --> 00:14:57.958\nAnd the more they succeed and the more power they have,\n\n00:14:57.958 --> 00:14:59.958\nthe more unhappy they are.\n\n00:14:59.958 --> 00:15:02.958\nAnd this is where you feel real compassion for them.\n\n00:15:02.958 --> 00:15:05.958\nAnd you then feel you must act.\n\n00:15:05.958 --> 00:15:07.958\nAnd the choice of the action, of course,\n\n00:15:07.958 --> 00:15:11.958\nhopefully will be more practical\n\n00:15:11.958 --> 00:15:15.958\nthan poor Asanga, who was fixing the maggots on the dog\n\n00:15:15.958 --> 00:15:18.958\nbecause he had that motivation, and whoever was in front of him,\n\n00:15:18.958 --> 00:15:20.958\nhe wanted to help.\n\n00:15:20.958 --> 00:15:24.958\nBut, of course, that is impractical. He should have founded the ASPCA in the town\n\n00:15:24.958 --> 00:15:27.958\nand gotten some scientific help for dogs and maggots.\n\n00:15:27.958 --> 00:15:33.958\nAnd I'm sure he did that later. (Laughter) But that just indicates the state of mind, you know.\n\n00:15:33.958 --> 00:15:37.958\nAnd so the next step -- the sixth step beyond \"universal compassion\" --\n\n00:15:37.958 --> 00:15:41.958\nis this thing where you're linked with the needs of others in a true way,\n\n00:15:41.958 --> 00:15:44.958\nand you have compassion for yourself also,\n\n00:15:44.958 --> 00:15:47.958\nand it isn't sentimental only. You might be in fear of something.\n\n00:15:47.958 --> 00:15:50.958\nSome bad guy is making himself more and more unhappy\n\n00:15:50.958 --> 00:15:52.958\nbeing more and more mean to other people\n\n00:15:52.958 --> 00:15:55.958\nand getting punished in the future for it in various ways.\n\n00:15:55.958 --> 00:15:58.958\nAnd in Buddhism, they catch it in the future life.\n\n00:15:58.958 --> 00:16:01.958\nOf course in theistic religion they're punished by God or whatever.\n\n00:16:01.958 --> 00:16:03.958\nAnd materialism, they think they get out of it just by not existing,\n\n00:16:03.958 --> 00:16:06.958\nby dying, but they don't.\n\n00:16:06.958 --> 00:16:09.958\nAnd so they get reborn as whatever, you know.\n\n00:16:09.958 --> 00:16:11.958\nNever mind. I won't get into that.\n\n00:16:11.958 --> 00:16:14.958\nBut the next step is called \"universal responsibility.\"\n\n00:16:14.958 --> 00:16:17.958\nAnd that is very important -- the Charter of Compassion\n\n00:16:17.958 --> 00:16:20.958\nmust lead us to develop through true compassion,\n\n00:16:20.958 --> 00:16:22.958\nwhat is called \"universal responsibility.\"\n\n00:16:22.958 --> 00:16:26.958\nIn the great teaching of his Holiness the Dalai Lama\n\n00:16:26.958 --> 00:16:28.958\nthat he always teaches everywhere, he says\n\n00:16:28.958 --> 00:16:31.958\nthat that is the common religion of humanity: kindness.\n\n00:16:31.958 --> 00:16:33.958\nBut \"kindness\" means \"universal responsibility.\"\n\n00:16:33.958 --> 00:16:37.958\nAnd that means whatever happens to other beings is happening to us:\n\n00:16:37.958 --> 00:16:41.958\nwe are responsible for that, and we should take it\n\n00:16:41.958 --> 00:16:43.958\nand do whatever we can at whatever little level\n\n00:16:43.958 --> 00:16:45.958\nand small level that we can do it.\n\n00:16:45.958 --> 00:16:49.958\nWe absolutely must do that. There is no way not to do it.\n\n00:16:49.958 --> 00:16:53.958\nAnd then, finally, that leads to a new orientation in life\n\n00:16:53.958 --> 00:16:57.958\nwhere we live equally for ourselves and for others\n\n00:16:57.958 --> 00:17:01.958\nand we are\n\n00:17:01.958 --> 00:17:03.958\njoyful and happy.\n\n00:17:03.958 --> 00:17:06.958\nOne thing we mustn't think is that compassion makes you miserable.\n\n00:17:06.958 --> 00:17:08.958\nCompassion makes you happy.\n\n00:17:08.958 --> 00:17:12.958\nThe first person who is happy when you get great compassion is yourself,\n\n00:17:12.958 --> 00:17:14.958\neven if you haven't done anything yet for anybody else.\n\n00:17:14.958 --> 00:17:19.958\nAlthough, the change in your mind already does something for other beings:\n\n00:17:19.958 --> 00:17:22.958\nthey can sense this new quality in yourself,\n\n00:17:22.958 --> 00:17:24.958\nand it helps them already, and gives them an example.\n\n00:17:24.958 --> 00:17:28.958\nAnd that uncompassionate clock has just showed me that it's all over.\n\n00:17:28.958 --> 00:17:33.958\nSo, practice compassion, read the charter, disseminate it\n\n00:17:33.958 --> 00:17:35.958\nand develop it within yourself.\n\n00:17:35.958 --> 00:17:38.958\nDon't just think, \"Well, I'm compassionate,\" or \"I'm not compassionate,\"\n\n00:17:38.958 --> 00:17:40.958\nand sort of think you're stuck there.\n\n00:17:40.958 --> 00:17:43.958\nYou can develop this. You can diminish the non-compassion,\n\n00:17:43.958 --> 00:17:47.958\nthe cruelty, the callousness, the neglect of others,\n\n00:17:47.958 --> 00:17:49.958\nand take universal responsibility for them.\n\n00:17:49.958 --> 00:17:54.958\nAnd then, not only will God smile and the eternal mama will smile,\n\n00:17:54.958 --> 00:17:56.958\nbut Karen Armstrong will smile.\n\n00:17:56.958 --> 00:17:58.958\nThank you very much.

I'm going to try to give you a little bit of a natural history of compassion and the golden rule. So, I'm going to be sometimes using kind of clinical language, and so it's not going to sound as warm and fuzzy as your average compassion talk. I want to warn you about that.So, I do want to say, at the outset, that I think compassion's great. The golden rule is great. I'm a big supporter of both. And I think it's great that the leaders of the religions of the world are affirming compassion and the golden rule as fundamental principles that are integral to their faiths.At the same time, I think religions don't deserve all the credit. I think nature gave them a helping hand here. I'm going to argue tonight that compassion and the golden rule are, in a certain sense, built into human nature. But I'm also going to argue that once you understand the sense in which they are built into human nature, you realize that just affirming compassion, and affirming the golden rule, is really not enough. There's a lot of work to be done after that.OK so, a quick natural history, first of compassion. In the beginning, there was compassion, and I mean not just when human beings first showed up, but actually even before that. I think it's probably the case that, in the human evolutionary lineage, even before there were homo sapiens, feelings like compassion and love and sympathy had earned their way into the gene pool, and biologists have a pretty clear idea of how this first happened.It happened through a principle known as kin selection. And the basic idea of kin selection is that, if an animal feels compassion for a close relative, and this compassion leads the animal to help the relative, then, in the end, the compassion actually winds up helping the genes underlying the compassion itself. So, from a biologist's point of view, compassion is actually a gene's way of helping itself. OK.I warned you this was not going to be very warm and fuzzy. I'll get there \u2014 I hope to get a little fuzzier. This doesn't bother me so much, that the underlying Darwinian rationale of compassion is kind of self-serving at the genetic level. Actually, I think the bad news about kin selection is just that it means that this kind of compassion is naturally deployed only within the family. That's the bad news. The good news is compassion is natural. The bad news is that this kin selected compassion is naturally confined to the family.Now, there's more good news that came along later in evolution, a second kind of evolutionary logic. Biologists call that \"reciprocal altruism.\" OK. And there, the basic idea is that compassion leads you to do good things for people who then will return the favor. Again, I know this is not as inspiring a notion of compassion as you may have heard in the past, but from a biologist's point of view, this reciprocal altruism kind of compassion is ultimately self-serving too. It's not that people think that, when they feel the compassion. It's not consciously self-serving, but to a biologist, that's the logic. And so, you wind up most easily extending compassion to friends and allies.I'm sure a lot of you, if a close friend has something really terrible happen to them, you feel really bad. But if you read in the newspaper that something really horrible happened to somebody you've never heard of, you can probably live with that. That's just human nature. So, it's another good news/bad news story. It's good that compassion was extended beyond the family by this kind of evolutionary logic. The bad news is this doesn't bring us universal compassion by itself. So, there's still work to be done.Now, there's one other result of this dynamic called reciprocal altruism, which I think is kind of good news, which is that the way that this is played out in the human species, it has given people an intuitive appreciation of the golden rule. I don't quite mean that the golden rule itself is written in our genes, but you can go to a hunter gatherer society that has had no exposure to any of the great religious traditions, no exposure to ethical philosophy, and you'll find, if you spend time with these people, that, basically, they believe that one good turn deserves another, and that bad deeds should be punished. And evolutionary psychologists think that these intuitions have a basis in the genes. So, they do understand that if you want to be treated well, you treat other people well. And it's good to treat other people well. That's close to being a kind of built-in intuition.So, that's good news. Now, if you've been paying attention, you're probably anticipating that there's bad news here; we still aren't to universal love, and it's true because, although an appreciation of the golden rule is natural, it's also natural to carve out exceptions to the golden rule.I mean, for example, none of us, probably, want to go to prison, but we all think that there are some people who should go to prison. Right? So, we think we should treat them differently than we would want to be treated. Now, we have a rationale for that. We say they did these bad things that make it just that they should go to prison.None of us really extends the golden rule in truly diffuse and universal fashion. We have the capacity to carve out exceptions, put people in a special category. And the problem is that \u2014 although in the case of sending people to prison, you have this impartial judiciary determining who gets excluded from the golden rule \u2014 that in everyday life, the way we all make these decisions about who we're not going to extend the golden rule to, is we use a much rougher and readier formula. Basically it's just like, if you're my enemy, if you're my rival \u2014 if you're not my friend, if you're not in my family \u2014 I'm much less inclined to apply the golden rule to you.We all do that, and you see it all over the world. You see it in the Middle East: people who, from Gaza, are firing missiles at Israel. They wouldn't want to have missiles fired at them, but they say, \"Well, but the Israelis, or some of them have done things that put them in a special category.\" The Israelis would not want to have an economic blockade imposed on them, but they impose one on Gaza, and they say, \"Well, the Palestinians, or some of them, have brought this on themselves.\"So, it's these exclusions to the golden rule that amount to a lot of the world's trouble. And it's natural to do that. So, the fact that the golden rule is in some sense built in to us is not, by itself, going to bring us universal love. It's not going to save the world.Now, there's one piece of good news I have that may save the world. Okay. Are you on the edges of your seats here? Good, because before I tell you about that good news, I'm going to have to take a little excursion through some academic terrain. So, I hope I've got your attention with this promise of good news that may save the world.It's this non-zero-sumness stuff you just heard a little bit about. It's just a quick introduction to game theory. This won't hurt. Okay. It's about zero-sum and non-zero-sum games. If you ask what kind of a situation is conducive to people becoming friends and allies, the technical answer is a non-zero-sum situation. And if you ask what kind of situation is conducive to people defining people as enemies, it's a zero-sum situation.So, what do those terms mean? Basically, a zero-sum game is the kind you're used to in sports, where there's a winner and a loser. So, their fortunes add up to zero. So, in tennis, every point is either good for you and bad for the other person, or good for them, bad for you. Either way, your fortunes add up to zero. That's a zero-sum game.Now, if you're playing doubles, then the person on your side of the net is in a non-zero-sum relationship with you, because every point is either good for both of you \u2014 positive, win-win \u2014 or bad for both of you, it's lose-lose. That's a non-zero-sum game. And in real life, there are lots of non-zero-sum games. In the realm of economics, say, if you buy something: that means you'd rather have the merchandise than the money, but the merchant would rather have the money than the merchandise. You both feel you've won. In a war, two allies are playing a non-zero-sum game. It's going to either be win-win or lose-lose for them.So, there are lots of non-zero-sum games in real life. And you could basically reformulate what I said earlier, about how compassion is deployed and the golden rule is deployed, by just saying, well, compassion most naturally flows along non-zero-sum channels where people perceive themselves as being in a potentially win-win situation with some of their friends or allies. The deployment of the golden rule most naturally happens along these non-zero-sum channels. So, kind of webs of non-zero-sumness are where you would expect compassion and the golden rule to kind of work their magic. With zero-sum channels you would expect something else.Okay. So, now you're ready for the good news that I said might save the world. And now I can admit that it might not too, now that I've held your attention for three minutes of technical stuff. But it may. And the good news is that history has naturally expanded these webs of non-zero-sumness, these webs that can be these channels for compassion. You can go back all the way to the stone age: technological evolution \u2014 roads, the wheel, writing, a lot of transportation and communication technologies \u2014 has just inexorably made it so that more people can be in more non-zero-sum relationships with more and more people at greater and greater distances. That's the story of civilization. It's why social organization has grown from the hunter-gatherer village to the ancient state, the empire, and now here we are in a globalized world. And the story of globalization is largely a story of non-zero-sumness.You've probably heard the term \"interdependence\" applied to the modern world. Well, that's just another term for non-zero-sum. If your fortunes are interdependent with somebody, then you live in a non-zero-sum relationship with them. And you see this all the time in the modern world. You saw it with the recent economic crash, where bad things happen in the economy \u2014 bad for everybody, for much of the world. Good things happen, and it's good for much of the world.And, you know, I'm happy to say, I think there's really evidence that this non-zero-sum kind of connection can expand the moral compass. I mean, if you look at the American attitudes toward Japanese during World War II \u2014 look at the depictions of Japanese in the American media as just about subhuman, and look at the fact that we dropped atomic bombs, really without giving it much of a thought \u2014 and you compare that to the attitude now, I think part of that is due to a kind of economic interdependence.Any form of interdependence, or non-zero-sum relationship forces you to acknowledge the humanity of people. So, I think that's good. And the world is full of non-zero-sum dynamics. Environmental problems, in many ways, put us all in the same boat. And there are non-zero-sum relationships that maybe people aren't aware of.For example, probably a lot of American Christians don't think of themselves as being in a non-zero-sum relationship with Muslims halfway around the world, but they really are, because if these Muslims become happier and happier with their place in the world and feel that they have a place in it, that's good for Americans, because there will be fewer terrorists to threaten American security. If they get less and less happy, that will be bad for Americans.So, there's plenty of non-zero-sumness. And so, the question is: If there's so much non-zero-sumness, why has the world not yet been suffused in love, peace, and understanding? The answer's complicated. It's the occasion for a whole other talk. Certainly, a couple of things are that, first of all, there are a lot of zero-sum situations in the world. And also, sometimes people don't recognize the non-zero-sum dynamics in the world. In both of these areas, I think politicians can play a role.This isn't only about religion. I think politicians can help foster non-zero-sum relationships, Economic engagement is generally better than blockades and so on, in this regard. And politicians can be aware, and should be aware that, when people around the world are looking at them, are looking at their nation and picking up their cues for whether they are in a zero-sum or a non-zero-sum relationship with a nation \u2014 like, say, America, or any other nation \u2014 human psychology is such that they use cues like: Do we feel we're being respected? Because, you know, historically, if you're not being respected, you're probably not going to wind up in a non-zero-sum, mutually profitable relationship with people. So, we need to be aware of what kind of signals we're sending out. And some of this, again, is in the realm of political work.If there's one thing I can encourage everyone to do, politicians, religious leaders, and us, it would be what I call \"expanding the moral imagination\" \u2014 that is to say, your ability to put yourself in the shoes of people in very different circumstances. This is not the same as compassion, but it's conducive to compassion. It opens the channels for compassion. And I'm afraid we have another good news/bad news story, which is that the moral imagination is part of human nature. That's good, but again we tend to deploy it selectively.Once we define somebody as an enemy, we have trouble putting ourselves in their shoes, just naturally. So, if you want to take a particularly hard case for an American: somebody in Iran who is burning an American flag, and you see them on TV. Well, the average American is going to resist the moral exercise of putting themselves in that person's head and is going to resist the idea that they have much in common with that person. And if you tell them, \"Well, they think America disrespects them and even wants to dominate them, and they hate America. Has there ever been somebody who disrespected you so much that you kind of hated them briefly\"? You know, they'll resist that comparison and that's natural, that's human.And, similarly, the person in Iran: when you try to humanize somebody in America who said that Islam is evil, they'll have trouble with that. So, it's a very difficult thing to get people to expand the moral imagination to a place it doesn't naturally go. I think it's worth the trouble because, again, it just helps us to understand. If you want to reduce the number of people who are burning flags, it helps to understand what makes them do it. And I think it's good moral exercise.I would say here is where religious leaders come in, because religious leaders are good at reframing issues for people, at harnessing the emotional centers of the brain to get people to alter their awareness and reframe the way they think. I mean, religious leaders are kind of in the inspiration business. It's their great calling right now, to get people all around the world better at expanding their moral imaginations, appreciating that in so many ways they're in the same boat.I would just sum up the way things look, at least from this secular perspective, as far as compassion and the golden rule go, by saying that it's good news that compassion and the golden rule are in some sense built into human nature. It's unfortunate that they tend to be selectively deployed. And it's going to take real work to change that. But, nobody ever said that doing God's work was going to be easy. Thanks.

OK.\n\n00:02:32.958 --> 00:02:36.958\nI warned you this was not going to be very warm and fuzzy.\n\n00:02:36.958 --> 00:02:39.958\nI'll get there -- I hope to get a little fuzzier.\n\n00:02:39.958 --> 00:02:41.958\nThis doesn't bother me so much,\n\n00:02:41.958 --> 00:02:45.958\nthat the underlying Darwinian rationale of compassion\n\n00:02:45.958 --> 00:02:47.958\nis kind of self-serving at the genetic level.\n\n00:02:47.958 --> 00:02:50.958\nActually, I think the bad news about kin selection\n\n00:02:50.958 --> 00:02:54.958\nis just that it means that this kind of compassion\n\n00:02:54.958 --> 00:02:57.958\nis naturally deployed only within the family.\n\n00:02:57.958 --> 00:03:00.958\nThat's the bad news. The good news is compassion is natural.\n\n00:03:00.958 --> 00:03:03.958\nThe bad news is that this kin selected compassion\n\n00:03:03.958 --> 00:03:05.958\nis naturally confined to the family.\n\n00:03:05.958 --> 00:03:09.958\nNow, there's more good news that came along later in evolution,\n\n00:03:09.958 --> 00:03:12.958\na second kind of evolutionary logic.\n\n00:03:12.958 --> 00:03:15.958\nBiologists call that \"reciprocal altruism.\" OK.\n\n00:03:15.958 --> 00:03:18.958\nAnd there, the basic idea is that\n\n00:03:18.958 --> 00:03:26.958\ncompassion leads you to do good things for people who then will return the favor.\n\n00:03:26.958 --> 00:03:31.958\nAgain, I know this is not as inspiring a notion of compassion\n\n00:03:31.958 --> 00:03:33.958\nas you may have heard in the past,\n\n00:03:33.958 --> 00:03:38.958\nbut from a biologist's point of view, this reciprocal altruism kind of compassion\n\n00:03:38.958 --> 00:03:41.958\nis ultimately self-serving too.\n\n00:03:41.958 --> 00:03:43.958\nIt's not that people think that, when they feel the compassion.\n\n00:03:43.958 --> 00:03:48.958\nIt's not consciously self-serving, but to a biologist, that's the logic.\n\n00:03:48.958 --> 00:03:54.958\nAnd so, you wind up most easily extending compassion to friends and allies.\n\n00:03:54.958 --> 00:04:00.958\nI'm sure a lot of you, if a close friend has something really terrible happen to them,\n\n00:04:00.958 --> 00:04:02.958\nyou feel really bad.\n\n00:04:02.958 --> 00:04:03.958\nBut if you read in the newspaper\n\n00:04:03.958 --> 00:04:06.958\nthat something really horrible happened to somebody you've never heard of,\n\n00:04:06.958 --> 00:04:08.958\nyou can probably live with that.\n\n00:04:08.958 --> 00:04:10.958\nThat's just human nature.\n\n00:04:10.958 --> 00:04:12.958\nSo, it's another good news/bad news story.\n\n00:04:12.958 --> 00:04:14.958\nIt's good that compassion was extended beyond the family\n\n00:04:14.958 --> 00:04:16.958\nby this kind of evolutionary logic.\n\n00:04:16.958 --> 00:04:21.958\nThe bad news is this doesn't bring us universal compassion by itself.\n\n00:04:21.958 --> 00:04:23.958\nSo, there's still work to be done.\n\n00:04:23.958 --> 00:04:28.958\nNow, there's one other result of this dynamic called reciprocal altruism,\n\n00:04:28.958 --> 00:04:30.958\nwhich I think is kind of good news,\n\n00:04:30.958 --> 00:04:34.958\nwhich is that the way that this is played out in the human species,\n\n00:04:34.958 --> 00:04:38.958\nit has given people an intuitive appreciation of the golden rule.\n\n00:04:38.958 --> 00:04:42.958\nI don't quite mean that the golden rule itself is written in our genes,\n\n00:04:42.958 --> 00:04:46.958\nbut you can go to a hunter gatherer society\n\n00:04:46.958 --> 00:04:49.958\nthat has had no exposure to any of the great religious traditions,\n\n00:04:49.958 --> 00:04:51.958\nno exposure to ethical philosophy,\n\n00:04:51.958 --> 00:04:53.958\nand you'll find, if you spend time with these people,\n\n00:04:53.958 --> 00:04:56.958\nthat, basically, they believe that one good turn deserves another,\n\n00:04:56.958 --> 00:04:58.958\nand that bad deeds should be punished.\n\n00:04:58.958 --> 00:05:04.958\nAnd evolutionary psychologists think that these intuitions have a basis in the genes.\n\n00:05:04.958 --> 00:05:08.958\nSo, they do understand that if you want to be treated well,\n\n00:05:08.958 --> 00:05:10.958\nyou treat other people well.\n\n00:05:10.958 --> 00:05:12.958\nAnd it's good to treat other people well.\n\n00:05:12.958 --> 00:05:16.958\nThat's close to being a kind of built-in intuition.\n\n00:05:16.958 --> 00:05:19.958\nSo, that's good news. Now, if you've been paying attention,\n\n00:05:19.958 --> 00:05:22.958\nyou're probably anticipating that there's bad news here;\n\n00:05:22.958 --> 00:05:24.958\nwe still aren't to universal love,\n\n00:05:24.958 --> 00:05:29.958\nand it's true because, although an appreciation of the golden rule is natural,\n\n00:05:29.958 --> 00:05:34.958\nit's also natural to carve out exceptions to the golden rule.\n\n00:05:34.958 --> 00:05:38.958\nI mean, for example, none of us, probably, want to go to prison,\n\n00:05:38.958 --> 00:05:41.958\nbut we all think that there are some people who should go to prison. Right?\n\n00:05:41.958 --> 00:05:45.958\nSo, we think we should treat them differently than we would want to be treated.\n\n00:05:45.958 --> 00:05:47.958\nNow, we have a rationale for that.\n\n00:05:47.958 --> 00:05:52.958\nWe say they did these bad things that make it just that they should go to prison.\n\n00:05:52.958 --> 00:05:56.958\nNone of us really extends the golden rule in truly diffuse and universal fashion.\n\n00:05:56.958 --> 00:05:59.958\nWe have the capacity to carve out exceptions,\n\n00:05:59.958 --> 00:06:01.958\nput people in a special category.\n\n00:06:01.958 --> 00:06:05.958\nAnd the problem is that -- although in the case of sending people to prison,\n\n00:06:05.958 --> 00:06:08.958\nyou have this impartial judiciary\n\n00:06:08.958 --> 00:06:12.958\ndetermining who gets excluded from the golden rule --\n\n00:06:12.958 --> 00:06:16.958\nthat in everyday life, the way we all make these decisions\n\n00:06:16.958 --> 00:06:19.958\nabout who we're not going to extend the golden rule to,\n\n00:06:19.958 --> 00:06:22.958\nis we use a much rougher and readier formula.\n\n00:06:22.958 --> 00:06:26.958\nBasically it's just like, if you're my enemy, if you're my rival --\n\n00:06:26.958 --> 00:06:28.958\nif you're not my friend, if you're not in my family --\n\n00:06:28.958 --> 00:06:33.958\nI'm much less inclined to apply the golden rule to you.\n\n00:06:33.958 --> 00:06:35.958\nWe all do that,\n\n00:06:35.958 --> 00:06:38.958\nand you see it all over the world.\n\n00:06:38.958 --> 00:06:41.958\nYou see it in the Middle East:\n\n00:06:41.958 --> 00:06:44.958\npeople who, from Gaza, are firing missiles at Israel.\n\n00:06:44.958 --> 00:06:46.958\nThey wouldn't want to have missiles fired at them, but they say,\n\n00:06:46.958 --> 00:06:48.958\n\"Well, but the Israelis, or some of them have done things\n\n00:06:48.958 --> 00:06:50.958\nthat put them in a special category.\"\n\n00:06:50.958 --> 00:06:53.958\nThe Israelis would not want to have an economic blockade imposed on them,\n\n00:06:53.958 --> 00:06:55.958\nbut they impose one on Gaza, and they say,\n\n00:06:55.958 --> 00:06:58.958\n\"Well, the Palestinians, or some of them, have brought this on themselves.\"\n\n00:06:58.958 --> 00:07:06.958\nSo, it's these exclusions to the golden rule that amount to a lot of the world's trouble.\n\n00:07:06.958 --> 00:07:09.958\nAnd it's natural to do that.\n\n00:07:09.958 --> 00:07:12.958\nSo, the fact that the golden rule is in some sense built in to us\n\n00:07:12.958 --> 00:07:18.958\nis not, by itself, going to bring us universal love.\n\n00:07:18.958 --> 00:07:20.958\nIt's not going to save the world.\n\n00:07:20.958 --> 00:07:25.958\nNow, there's one piece of good news I have that may save the world. Okay.\n\n00:07:25.958 --> 00:07:28.958\nAre you on the edges of your seats here?\n\n00:07:28.958 --> 00:07:30.958\nGood, because before I tell you about that good news,\n\n00:07:30.958 --> 00:07:35.958\nI'm going to have to take a little excursion through some academic terrain.\n\n00:07:35.958 --> 00:07:38.958\nSo, I hope I've got your attention with this promise of good news\n\n00:07:38.958 --> 00:07:41.958\nthat may save the world.\n\n00:07:41.958 --> 00:07:44.958\nIt's this non-zero-sumness stuff you just heard a little bit about.\n\n00:07:44.958 --> 00:07:47.958\nIt's just a quick introduction to game theory.\n\n00:07:47.958 --> 00:07:49.958\nThis won't hurt. Okay.\n\n00:07:49.958 --> 00:07:51.958\nIt's about zero-sum and non-zero-sum games.\n\n00:07:51.958 --> 00:07:55.958\nIf you ask what kind of a situation\n\n00:07:55.958 --> 00:07:58.958\nis conducive to people becoming friends and allies,\n\n00:07:58.958 --> 00:08:01.958\nthe technical answer is a non-zero-sum situation.\n\n00:08:01.958 --> 00:08:03.958\nAnd if you ask what kind of situation\n\n00:08:03.958 --> 00:08:05.958\nis conducive to people defining people as enemies,\n\n00:08:05.958 --> 00:08:07.958\nit's a zero-sum situation.\n\n00:08:07.958 --> 00:08:09.958\nSo, what do those terms mean?\n\n00:08:09.958 --> 00:08:12.958\nBasically, a zero-sum game is the kind you're used to in sports,\n\n00:08:12.958 --> 00:08:14.958\nwhere there's a winner and a loser.\n\n00:08:14.958 --> 00:08:17.958\nSo, their fortunes add up to zero.\n\n00:08:17.958 --> 00:08:22.958\nSo, in tennis, every point is either good for you and bad for the other person,\n\n00:08:22.958 --> 00:08:24.958\nor good for them, bad for you.\n\n00:08:24.958 --> 00:08:27.958\nEither way, your fortunes add up to zero. That's a zero-sum game.\n\n00:08:27.958 --> 00:08:29.958\nNow, if you're playing doubles,\n\n00:08:29.958 --> 00:08:31.958\nthen the person on your side of the net\n\n00:08:31.958 --> 00:08:34.958\nis in a non-zero-sum relationship with you,\n\n00:08:34.958 --> 00:08:37.958\nbecause every point is either good for both of you -- positive, win-win --\n\n00:08:37.958 --> 00:08:39.958\nor bad for both of you, it's lose-lose.\n\n00:08:39.958 --> 00:08:41.958\nThat's a non-zero-sum game.\n\n00:08:41.958 --> 00:08:44.958\nAnd in real life, there are lots of non-zero-sum games.\n\n00:08:44.958 --> 00:08:47.958\nIn the realm of economics, say, if you buy something:\n\n00:08:47.958 --> 00:08:50.958\nthat means you'd rather have the merchandise than the money,\n\n00:08:50.958 --> 00:08:53.958\nbut the merchant would rather have the money than the merchandise.\n\n00:08:53.958 --> 00:08:55.958\nYou both feel you've won.\n\n00:08:55.958 --> 00:08:58.958\nIn a war, two allies are playing a non-zero-sum game.\n\n00:08:58.958 --> 00:09:01.958\nIt's going to either be win-win or lose-lose for them.\n\n00:09:01.958 --> 00:09:08.958\nSo, there are lots of non-zero-sum games in real life.\n\n00:09:08.958 --> 00:09:12.958\nAnd you could basically reformulate what I said earlier,\n\n00:09:12.958 --> 00:09:15.958\nabout how compassion is deployed and the golden rule is deployed,\n\n00:09:15.958 --> 00:09:21.958\nby just saying, well, compassion most naturally flows along non-zero-sum channels\n\n00:09:21.958 --> 00:09:24.958\nwhere people perceive themselves as being in a potentially win-win situation\n\n00:09:24.958 --> 00:09:27.958\nwith some of their friends or allies.\n\n00:09:27.958 --> 00:09:29.958\nThe deployment of the golden rule\n\n00:09:29.958 --> 00:09:32.958\nmost naturally happens along these non-zero-sum channels.\n\n00:09:32.958 --> 00:09:34.958\nSo, kind of webs of non-zero-sumness\n\n00:09:34.958 --> 00:09:38.958\nare where you would expect compassion and the golden rule\n\n00:09:38.958 --> 00:09:40.958\nto kind of work their magic.\n\n00:09:40.958 --> 00:09:42.958\nWith zero-sum channels you would expect something else.\n\n00:09:42.958 --> 00:09:46.958\nOkay. So, now you're ready for the good news that I said might save the world.\n\n00:09:46.958 --> 00:09:49.958\nAnd now I can admit that it might not too,\n\n00:09:49.958 --> 00:09:55.958\nnow that I've held your attention for three minutes of technical stuff.\n\n00:09:55.958 --> 00:10:00.958\nBut it may. And the good news is that history\n\n00:10:00.958 --> 00:10:04.958\nhas naturally expanded these webs of non-zero-sumness,\n\n00:10:04.958 --> 00:10:08.958\nthese webs that can be these channels for compassion.\n\n00:10:08.958 --> 00:10:11.958\nYou can go back all the way to the stone age:\n\n00:10:11.958 --> 00:10:19.958\ntechnological evolution -- roads, the wheel, writing,\n\n00:10:19.958 --> 00:10:22.958\na lot of transportation and communication technologies --\n\n00:10:22.958 --> 00:10:25.958\nhas just inexorably made it so that more people\n\n00:10:25.958 --> 00:10:28.958\ncan be in more non-zero-sum relationships\n\n00:10:28.958 --> 00:10:31.958\nwith more and more people at greater and greater distances.\n\n00:10:31.958 --> 00:10:34.958\nThat's the story of civilization.\n\n00:10:34.958 --> 00:10:39.958\nIt's why social organization has grown from the hunter-gatherer village\n\n00:10:39.958 --> 00:10:42.958\nto the ancient state, the empire, and now here we are in a globalized world.\n\n00:10:42.958 --> 00:10:46.958\nAnd the story of globalization is largely a story of non-zero-sumness.\n\n00:10:46.958 --> 00:10:48.958\nYou've probably heard the term \"interdependence\"\n\n00:10:48.958 --> 00:10:52.958\napplied to the modern world. Well, that's just another term for non-zero-sum.\n\n00:10:52.958 --> 00:10:55.958\nIf your fortunes are interdependent with somebody,\n\n00:10:55.958 --> 00:10:58.958\nthen you live in a non-zero-sum relationship with them.\n\n00:10:58.958 --> 00:11:00.958\nAnd you see this all the time in the modern world.\n\n00:11:00.958 --> 00:11:02.958\nYou saw it with the recent economic crash,\n\n00:11:02.958 --> 00:11:05.958\nwhere bad things happen in the economy --\n\n00:11:05.958 --> 00:11:08.958\nbad for everybody, for much of the world.\n\n00:11:08.958 --> 00:11:11.958\nGood things happen, and it's good for much of the world.\n\n00:11:11.958 --> 00:11:14.958\nAnd, you know, I'm happy to say, I think there's really evidence\n\n00:11:14.958 --> 00:11:17.958\nthat this non-zero-sum kind of connection\n\n00:11:17.958 --> 00:11:20.958\ncan expand the moral compass.\n\n00:11:20.958 --> 00:11:23.958\nI mean, if you look at the American attitudes\n\n00:11:23.958 --> 00:11:27.958\ntoward Japanese during World War II --\n\n00:11:27.958 --> 00:11:29.958\nlook at the depictions of Japanese\n\n00:11:29.958 --> 00:11:31.958\nin the American media as just about subhuman,\n\n00:11:31.958 --> 00:11:33.958\nand look at the fact that we dropped atomic bombs,\n\n00:11:33.958 --> 00:11:36.958\nreally without giving it much of a thought --\n\n00:11:36.958 --> 00:11:38.958\nand you compare that to the attitude now,\n\n00:11:38.958 --> 00:11:41.958\nI think part of that is due to a kind of economic interdependence.\n\n00:11:41.958 --> 00:11:44.958\nAny form of interdependence, or non-zero-sum relationship\n\n00:11:44.958 --> 00:11:47.958\nforces you to acknowledge the humanity of people.\n\n00:11:47.958 --> 00:11:49.958\nSo, I think that's good.\n\n00:11:49.958 --> 00:11:52.958\nAnd the world is full of non-zero-sum dynamics.\n\n00:11:52.958 --> 00:11:56.958\nEnvironmental problems, in many ways, put us all in the same boat.\n\n00:11:56.958 --> 00:12:01.958\nAnd there are non-zero-sum relationships that maybe people aren't aware of.\n\n00:12:01.958 --> 00:12:05.958\nFor example, probably a lot of American Christians\n\n00:12:05.958 --> 00:12:09.958\ndon't think of themselves as being in a non-zero-sum relationship\n\n00:12:09.958 --> 00:12:11.958\nwith Muslims halfway around the world,\n\n00:12:11.958 --> 00:12:16.958\nbut they really are, because if these Muslims become happier and happier\n\n00:12:16.958 --> 00:12:19.958\nwith their place in the world and feel that they have a place in it,\n\n00:12:19.958 --> 00:12:22.958\nthat's good for Americans, because there will be fewer terrorists\n\n00:12:22.958 --> 00:12:24.958\nto threaten American security.\n\n00:12:24.958 --> 00:12:28.958\nIf they get less and less happy, that will be bad for Americans.\n\n00:12:28.958 --> 00:12:31.958\nSo, there's plenty of non-zero-sumness.\n\n00:12:31.958 --> 00:12:36.958\nAnd so, the question is: If there's so much non-zero-sumness,\n\n00:12:36.958 --> 00:12:40.958\nwhy has the world not yet been suffused in love, peace, and understanding?\n\n00:12:40.958 --> 00:12:43.958\nThe answer's complicated. It's the occasion for a whole other talk.\n\n00:12:43.958 --> 00:12:47.958\nCertainly, a couple of things are that,\n\n00:12:47.958 --> 00:12:51.958\nfirst of all, there are a lot of zero-sum situations in the world.\n\n00:12:51.958 --> 00:12:55.958\nAnd also, sometimes people don't recognize\n\n00:12:55.958 --> 00:13:00.958\nthe non-zero-sum dynamics in the world.\n\n00:13:00.958 --> 00:13:02.958\nIn both of these areas,\n\n00:13:02.958 --> 00:13:05.958\nI think politicians can play a role.\n\n00:13:05.958 --> 00:13:07.958\nThis isn't only about religion.\n\n00:13:07.958 --> 00:13:12.958\nI think politicians can help foster non-zero-sum relationships,\n\n00:13:12.958 --> 00:13:15.958\nEconomic engagement is generally better than blockades and so on,\n\n00:13:15.958 --> 00:13:17.958\nin this regard.\n\n00:13:17.958 --> 00:13:20.958\nAnd politicians can be aware, and should be aware that,\n\n00:13:20.958 --> 00:13:22.958\nwhen people around the world are looking at them,\n\n00:13:22.958 --> 00:13:24.958\nare looking at their nation\n\n00:13:24.958 --> 00:13:26.958\nand picking up their cues\n\n00:13:26.958 --> 00:13:30.958\nfor whether they are in a zero-sum or a non-zero-sum relationship with a nation --\n\n00:13:30.958 --> 00:13:33.958\nlike, say, America, or any other nation --\n\n00:13:33.958 --> 00:13:36.958\nhuman psychology is such that they use cues like:\n\n00:13:36.958 --> 00:13:38.958\nDo we feel we're being respected?\n\n00:13:38.958 --> 00:13:41.958\nBecause, you know, historically, if you're not being respected,\n\n00:13:41.958 --> 00:13:44.958\nyou're probably not going to wind up in a non-zero-sum,\n\n00:13:44.958 --> 00:13:47.958\nmutually profitable relationship with people.\n\n00:13:47.958 --> 00:13:52.958\nSo, we need to be aware of what kind of signals we're sending out.\n\n00:13:52.958 --> 00:13:57.958\nAnd some of this, again, is in the realm of political work.\n\n00:13:57.958 --> 00:13:59.958\nIf there's one thing I can encourage everyone to do,\n\n00:13:59.958 --> 00:14:02.958\npoliticians, religious leaders, and us,\n\n00:14:02.958 --> 00:14:07.958\nit would be what I call \"expanding the moral imagination\" --\n\n00:14:07.958 --> 00:14:10.958\nthat is to say, your ability to put yourself in the shoes\n\n00:14:10.958 --> 00:14:13.958\nof people in very different circumstances.\n\n00:14:13.958 --> 00:14:15.958\nThis is not the same as compassion,\n\n00:14:15.958 --> 00:14:21.958\nbut it's conducive to compassion. It opens the channels for compassion.\n\n00:14:21.958 --> 00:14:24.958\nAnd I'm afraid we have another good news/bad news story,\n\n00:14:24.958 --> 00:14:27.958\nwhich is that the moral imagination is part of human nature.\n\n00:14:27.958 --> 00:14:32.958\nThat's good, but again we tend to deploy it selectively.\n\n00:14:32.958 --> 00:14:34.958\nOnce we define somebody as an enemy,\n\n00:14:34.958 --> 00:14:39.958\nwe have trouble putting ourselves in their shoes, just naturally.\n\n00:14:39.958 --> 00:14:43.958\nSo, if you want to take a particularly hard case for an American:\n\n00:14:43.958 --> 00:14:47.958\nsomebody in Iran who is burning an American flag, and you see them on TV.\n\n00:14:47.958 --> 00:14:50.958\nWell, the average American is going to resist\n\n00:14:50.958 --> 00:14:54.958\nthe moral exercise of putting themselves in that person's head\n\n00:14:54.958 --> 00:14:57.958\nand is going to resist the idea that they have much in common with that person.\n\n00:14:57.958 --> 00:15:01.958\nAnd if you tell them, \"Well, they think America disrespects them\n\n00:15:01.958 --> 00:15:04.958\nand even wants to dominate them, and they hate America.\n\n00:15:04.958 --> 00:15:06.958\nHas there ever been somebody who disrespected you so much\n\n00:15:06.958 --> 00:15:08.958\nthat you kind of hated them briefly\"?\n\n00:15:08.958 --> 00:15:11.958\nYou know, they'll resist that comparison and that's natural, that's human.\n\n00:15:11.958 --> 00:15:13.958\nAnd, similarly, the person in Iran:\n\n00:15:13.958 --> 00:15:17.958\nwhen you try to humanize somebody in America who said that Islam is evil,\n\n00:15:17.958 --> 00:15:19.958\nthey'll have trouble with that.\n\n00:15:19.958 --> 00:15:24.958\nSo, it's a very difficult thing to get people to expand the moral imagination\n\n00:15:24.958 --> 00:15:27.958\nto a place it doesn't naturally go.\n\n00:15:27.958 --> 00:15:30.958\nI think it's worth the trouble because,\n\n00:15:30.958 --> 00:15:32.958\nagain, it just helps us to understand.\n\n00:15:32.958 --> 00:15:34.958\nIf you want to reduce the number of people who are burning flags,\n\n00:15:34.958 --> 00:15:36.958\nit helps to understand what makes them do it.\n\n00:15:36.958 --> 00:15:39.958\nAnd I think it's good moral exercise.\n\n00:15:39.958 --> 00:15:42.958\nI would say here is where religious leaders come in,\n\n00:15:42.958 --> 00:15:49.958\nbecause religious leaders are good at reframing issues for people,\n\n00:15:49.958 --> 00:15:51.958\nat harnessing the emotional centers of the brain\n\n00:15:51.958 --> 00:15:56.958\nto get people to alter their awareness and reframe the way they think.\n\n00:15:56.958 --> 00:16:00.958\nI mean, religious leaders are kind of in the inspiration business.\n\n00:16:00.958 --> 00:16:02.958\nIt's their great calling right now,\n\n00:16:02.958 --> 00:16:06.958\nto get people all around the world better at expanding their moral imaginations,\n\n00:16:06.958 --> 00:16:10.958\nappreciating that in so many ways they're in the same boat.\n\n00:16:10.958 --> 00:16:16.958\nI would just sum up the way things look, at least from this secular perspective,\n\n00:16:16.958 --> 00:16:20.958\nas far as compassion and the golden rule go,\n\n00:16:20.958 --> 00:16:26.958\nby saying that it's good news that compassion and the golden rule\n\n00:16:26.958 --> 00:16:31.958\nare in some sense built into human nature.\n\n00:16:31.958 --> 00:16:36.958\nIt's unfortunate that they tend to be selectively deployed.\n\n00:16:36.958 --> 00:16:40.958\nAnd it's going to take real work to change that.\n\n00:16:40.958 --> 00:16:45.958\nBut, nobody ever said that doing God's work was going to be easy. Thanks.\n\n00:16:45.958 --> 00:16:47.958\n(Applause)"}, {"title": "A flight through the ocean", "duration": "731", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/graham_hawkes_flies_through_the_ocean", "transcript": "I think the future of this planet depends on humans, not technology, and we already have the knowledge \u2014 we\u2019re kind of at the endgame with knowledge. But we\u2019re nowhere near the endgame when it comes to our perception. We still have one foot in the dark ages. And when you listen to some of the presentations here \u2014 and the extraordinary range of human capability, our understandings \u2014 and then you contrast it with the fact we still call this planet, \"Earth:\" it\u2019s pretty extraordinary \u2014 we have one foot in the dark ages.Just quickly: Aristotle, his thing was, \"It\u2019s not flat, stupid, it\u2019s round.\" Galileo \u2014 he had the Inquisition, so he had to be a little bit more polite \u2014 his was, \"It\u2019s not in the middle, you know.\" And Hawkes: \"it\u2019s not earth, stupid, it\u2019s ocean.\" This is an ocean planet. T.S. Eliot really said it for me \u2014 and this should give you goose bumps: \"we shall not cease from exploration and the end of our exploring shall be to return where we started and know the place for the first time.\" And the next lines are, \"Through the unknown remembered gate, where the last of earth discovered is that which is the beginning.\" So I have one message. It seems to me that we\u2019re all pointed in the wrong direction.For the rocketeers in the audience: I love what you\u2019re doing, I admire the guts, I admire the courage \u2014 but your rockets are pointed in the wrong goddamn direction. (Laughter) And it\u2019s all a question of perspective. Let me try and tell you \u2014 I don\u2019t mean to insult you, but look, if I \u2014 and I\u2019m not doing this for real because it would be an insult, so I\u2019m going to pretend, and it softens the blow \u2014 I\u2019m going to tell you what you\u2019re thinking. If I held up a square that was one foot square and the color of earth, and I held up another square that was the root two square \u2014 so it\u2019s 1.5 times bigger \u2014 and was the color of the oceans; and I said, what is the relative value of these two things? Well, it\u2019s the relative importance. You would say \u2014 yeah, yeah, yeah, we all know this; water covers twice the area of the planet than dry land. But it\u2019s a question of perception, and if that\u2019s what you\u2019re thinking, if that\u2019s what you think I mean when I say, \"This is an ocean planet stupidly called 'Earth.'\" If you think that that\u2019s the relative importance, two to one, you\u2019re wrong by a factor of ten. Now, you\u2019re not as thick as two short planks, but you sound like it when you say \"Earth,\" because that demonstration, if I turned around this way \u2014 that earth plane would be as thin as paper. It\u2019s a thin film, two-dimensional existence. The ocean representation would have a depth to it. And if you hefted those two things you might find that the relative scale of those is 20 to 1.It turns out that something more than 94 percent of life on earth is aquatic. That means that us terrestrials occupy a minority. The problem we have in believing that is \u2014 you just have to give up this notion that this Earth was created for us. Because it\u2019s a problem we have. If this is an ocean planet and we only have a small minority of this planet, it just interferes with a lot of what humanity thinks.Okay. Let me criticize this thing. I\u2019m not talking about James Cameron \u2014 although I could, but I won\u2019t. You really do have to go and see his latest film, \"Aliens of the Deep.\" It\u2019s incredible. It features two of these deep rovers, and I can criticize them because these sweet things are mine. This, I think, represents one of the most beautiful classic submersibles built. If you look at that sub, you\u2019ll see a sphere. This is an acryclic sphere. It generates all of the buoyancy, all of the payload for the craft, and the batteries are down here hanging underneath, exactly like a balloon. This is the envelope, and this is the gondola, the payload. Also coming up later for criticism are these massive lights. And this one actually carries two great manipulators. It actually is a very good working sub \u2014 that\u2019s what it was designed for. The problem with it is \u2014 and the reason I will never build another one like it \u2014 is that this is a product of two-dimensional thinking. It\u2019s what we humans do when we go in the ocean as engineers; we take all our terrestrial hang-ups, all our constraints \u2014 importantly, these two-dimensional constraints that we have, and they\u2019re so constrained we don\u2019t even understand it \u2014 and we take them underwater. You notice that Jim Cameron is sitting in a seat. A seat works in a two-dimensional world, where gravity blasts down on that seat, OK? And in a two-dimensional world, we do know about the third dimension but we don\u2019t use it because to go up requires an awful lot of energy against gravity. And then our mothers tell us, \"Careful you don\u2019t fall down\" \u2014 because you\u2019ll fall over.Now, go into the real atmosphere of this planet. This planet has an inner atmosphere of water; it\u2019s its inner atmosphere. It has two atmospheres \u2014 a lesser, outer gaseous atmosphere, a lighter one. Most of life on earth is in that inner atmosphere. And that life enjoys a three-dimensional existence, which is alien to us. Fish do not sit in seats. (Laughter) They don\u2019t. Their mothers don\u2019t say to little baby fish, \"Careful you don\u2019t fall over.\" They don\u2019t fall over. They don\u2019t fall. They live in a three-dimensional world where there is no difference in energy between going this way, that way, that way or that way. It\u2019s truly a three-dimensional space. And we\u2019re only just beginning to grasp it. I don\u2019t know of any other submersible, or even remote, that just takes advantage that this is a three-dimensional space.This is the way we should be going into the oceans. This is a three-dimensional machine. What we need to do is go down into the ocean with the freedom of the animals, and move in this three-dimensional space. OK, this is good stuff. This is man\u2019s first attempt at flying underwater. Right now, I\u2019m just coming down on this gorgeous, big, giant manta ray. She has twice the wingspan that I do. There I\u2019m coming; she sees me. And just notice how she rolls under and turns; she doesn\u2019t sit there and try and blow air into a tank and kind of flow up or sink down \u2014 she just rolls. And the craft that I\u2019m in \u2014 this hasn\u2019t been shown before. Chris asked us to show stuff that hasn\u2019t been shown before. I wanted you to notice that she actually turned to come back up. There I am; I see her coming back, coming up underneath me. I put reverse thrust and I try and pull gently down. I\u2019m trying to do everything very gently. We spent about three hours together and she\u2019s beginning to trust me. And this ballet is controlled by this lady here. She gets about that close and then she pulls away. So now I try and go after her, but I\u2019m practicing flying. This is the first flying machine. This was the first prototype. This was a fly by wire. It has wings. There\u2019re no silly buoyancy tanks \u2014 it\u2019s permanently, positively buoyant. And then by moving through the water it\u2019s able to take that control. Now, look at that; look, it\u2019s \u2014 she just blew me away. She just rolled right away from underneath. Really that\u2019s the only real dive I\u2019ve ever made in this machine.It took 10 years to build. But this lady here taught me, hah, taught me so much. We just learned so much in three hours in the water there. I just had to go and build another machine. But look here. Instead of blowing tanks and coming up slowly without thinking about it, it\u2019s a little bit of back pressure, and that sub just comes straight back up out of the water.This is an internal Sony camera. Thank you, Sony. I don\u2019t really look that ugly, but the camera is so close that it\u2019s just distorted. Now, there she goes, right overhead. This is a wide-angle camera. She\u2019s just a few inches off the top of my head. \"Aah, ha, oh, he just crossed over the top of my head about, oh, I don\u2019t know, just so close.\" I come back up, not for air. \"This is an incredible encounter with a manta. I\u2019m speechless. We\u2019ve been just feet apart. I\u2019m going back down now.\" Okay, can we cut that? Lights back up please. (Applause)Trying to fly and keep up with that animal \u2014 it wasn\u2019t the lack of maneuverability that we had. It was the fact she was going so slow. I actually designed that to move faster through the water because I thought that was the thing that we needed to do: to move fast and get range. But after that encounter I really did want to go back with that animal and dance. She wanted to dance. And so what we needed to do was increase the wing area so that we just had more grip, develop higher forces.So the sub that was outside last year \u2014 this is the one. You see the larger wing area here. Also, clearly, it was such a powerful thing, we wanted to try and bring other people but we couldn't figure out how to do it. So we opened the world\u2019s first flight school. The rational for the world\u2019s first flight school goes something like: when the coastguards come up to me and say \u2014 they used to leave us alone when we were diving these goofy little spherical things, but when we started flying around in underwater jet fighters they got a little nervous \u2014 they would come up and say, \"Do you have a license for that?\" And then I\u2019d put my sunglasses on, the beard that would all sprout out, and I would say, \"I don\u2019t need no stinking license.\" (Laughter) \"I write these stinking license,\" which I do. So Bob Gelfond's around here \u2014 but somebody in the audience here has license number 20. They\u2019re one of the first subsea aviators. So we\u2019ve run two flight schools. Where the hell that goes, I don\u2019t know, but it\u2019s a lot of fun. What comes next in 30 seconds? I can\u2019t tell you.But the patent for underwater flight \u2014 Karen and I, we were looking at it, some business partners wanted us to patent it \u2014 we weren\u2019t sure about that. We\u2019ve decided we\u2019re just going to let that go. It just seems wrong to try and patent \u2014 (Applause) \u2014 the freedom for underwater flight. So anybody who wants to copy us and come and join us, go for it. The other thing is that we\u2019ve got much lower costs. We developed some other technology called spider optics, and Craig Ventner asked me to make an announcement here this morning: we\u2019re going to be building a beautiful, little, small version of this \u2014 unmanned, super deep \u2014 for his boat to go and get back some deep sea DNA stuff.

We stood on the railroad tracks that ran between my friend's house and the beach. The tracks are elevated about eight feet from the waterline normally, but at that point the water had receded to a level three or four feet below normal. I'd never seen the reef here before. There were fish caught in rock pools left behind by the receding water. Some children jumped down and ran to the rock pools with bags. They were trying to catch fish. No one realized that this was a very bad idea. The people on the tracks just continued to watch them. I turned around to check on my friend's house. Then someone on the tracks screamed. Before I could turn around, everyone on the tracks was screaming and running.The water had started coming back. It was foaming over the reef. The children managed to run back onto the tracks. No one was lost there. But the water continued to climb. In about two minutes, it had reached the level of the railroad tracks and was coming over it. We had run about 100 meters by this time. It continued to rise. I saw an old man standing at his gate, knee-deep in water, refusing to move. He said he'd lived his whole life there by the beach, and that he would rather die there than run. A boy broke away from his mother to run back into his house to get his dog, who was apparently afraid. An old lady, crying, was carried out of her house and up the road by her son. The slum built on the railroad reservation between the sea and the railroad tracks was completely swept away. Since this was a high-risk location, the police had warned the residents, and no one was there when the water rose. But they had not had any time to evacuate any belongings. For hours afterwards, the sea was strewn with bits of wood for miles around \u2014 all of this was from the houses in the slum. When the waters subsided, it was as if it had never existed.This may seem hard to believe \u2014 unless you've been reading lots and lots of news reports \u2014 but in many places, after the tsunami, villagers were still terrified. When what was a tranquil sea swallows up people, homes and long-tail boats \u2014 mercilessly, without warning \u2014 and no one can tell you anything reliable about whether another one is coming, I'm not sure you'd want to calm down either. One of the scariest things about the tsunami that I've not seen mentioned is the complete lack of information. This may seem minor, but it is terrifying to hear rumor after rumor after rumor that another tidal wave, bigger than the last, will be coming at exactly 1 p.m., or perhaps tonight, or perhaps ... You don't even know if it is safe to go back down to the water, to catch a boat to the hospital. We think that Phi Phi hospital was destroyed. We think this boat is going to Phuket hospital, but if it's too dangerous to land at its pier, then perhaps it will go to Krabi instead, which is more protected. We don't think another wave is coming right away.At the Phi Phi Hill Resort, I was tucked into the corner furthest away from the television, but I strained to listen for information. They reported that there was an 8.5 magnitude earthquake in Sumatra, which triggered the massive tsunami. Having this news was comforting in some small way to understand what had just happened to us. However, the report focused on what had already occurred and offered no information on what to expect now. In general, everything was merely hearsay and rumor, and not a single person I spoke to for over 36 hours knew anything with any certainty. Those were two accounts of the Asian tsunami from two Internet blogs that essentially sprang up after it occurred. I'm now going to show you two video segments from the tsunami that also were shown on blogs. I should warn you, they're pretty powerful. One from Thailand, and the second one from Phuket as well.(Screaming)Voice 1: It's coming in. It's coming again.Voice 2: It's coming again?Voice 1: Yeah. It's coming again.Voice 2: Come get inside here.Voice 1: It's coming again. Voice 2: New wave? Voice 1: It's coming again. New wave! [Unclear](Screaming)They called me out here.James Surowiecki: Phew. Those were both on this site: waveofdestruction.org. In the world of blogs, there's going to be before the tsunami and after the tsunami, because one of the things that happened in the wake of the tsunami was that, although initially \u2014 that is, in that first day \u2014 there was actually a kind of dearth of live reporting, there was a dearth of live video and some people complained about this. They said, \"The blogsters let us down.\" What became very clear was that, within a few days, the outpouring of information was immense, and we got a complete and powerful picture of what had happened in a way that we never had been able to get before. And what you had was a group of essentially unorganized, unconnected writers, video bloggers, etc., who were able to come up with a collective portrait of a disaster that gave us a much better sense of what it was like to actually be there than the mainstream media could give us.And so in some ways the tsunami can be seen as a sort of seminal moment, a moment in which the blogosphere came, to a certain degree, of age. Now, I'm going to move now from this kind of \u2014 the sublime in the traditional sense of the word, that is to say, awe-inspiring, terrifying \u2014 to the somewhat more mundane. Because when we think about blogs, I think for most of us who are concerned about them, we're primarily concerned with things like politics, technology, etc. And I want to ask three questions in this talk, in the 10 minutes that remain, about the blogosphere. The first one is, What does it tell us about our ideas, about what motivates people to do things? The second is, Do blogs genuinely have the possibility of accessing a kind of collective intelligence that has previously remained, for the most part, untapped? And then the third part is, What are the potential problems, or the dark side of blogs as we know them?OK, the first question: What do they tell us about why people do things? One of the fascinating things about the blogosphere specifically, and, of course, the Internet more generally \u2014 and it's going to seem like a very obvious point, but I think it is an important one to think about \u2014 is that the people who are generating these enormous reams of content every day, who are spending enormous amounts of time organizing, linking, commenting on the substance of the Internet, are doing so primarily for free. They are not getting paid for it in any way other than in the attention and, to some extent, the reputational capital that they gain from doing a good job. And this is \u2014 at least, to a traditional economist \u2014 somewhat remarkable, because the traditional account of economic man would say that, basically, you do things for a concrete reward, primarily financial. But instead, what we're finding on the Internet \u2014 and one of the great geniuses of it \u2014 is that people have found a way to work together without any money involved at all. They have come up with, in a sense, a different method for organizing activity.The Yale Law professor Yochai Benkler, in an essay called \"Coase's Penguin,\" talks about this open-source model, which we're familiar with from Linux, as being potentially applicable in a whole host of situations. And, you know, if you think about this with the tsunami, what you have is essentially a kind of an army of local journalists, who are producing enormous amounts of material for no reason other than to tell their stories. That's a very powerful idea, and it's a very powerful reality. And it's one that offers really interesting possibilities for organizing a whole host of activities down the road.So, I think the first thing that the blogosphere tells us is that we need to expand our idea of what counts as rational, and we need to expand our simple equation of value equals money, or, you have to pay for it to be good, but that in fact you can end up with collectively really brilliant products without any money at all changing hands. There are a few bloggers \u2014 somewhere maybe around 20, now \u2014 who do, in fact, make some kind of money, and a few who are actually trying to make a full-time living out of it, but the vast majority of them are doing it because they love it or they love the attention, or whatever it is. So, Howard Rheingold has written a lot about this and, I think, is writing about this more, but this notion of voluntary cooperation is an incredibly powerful one, and one worth thinking about.The second question is, What does the blogosphere actually do for us, in terms of accessing collective intelligence? You know, as Chris mentioned, I wrote a book called \"The Wisdom of Crowds.\" And the premise of \"The Wisdom of Crowds\" is that, under the right conditions, groups can be remarkably intelligent. And they can actually often be smarter than even the smartest person within them. The simplest example of this is if you ask a group of people to do something like guess how many jellybeans are in a jar. If I had a jar of jellybeans and I asked you all to guess how many jellybeans were in that jar, your average guess would be remarkably good. It would be somewhere probably within three and five percent of the number of beans in the jar, and it would be better than 90 to 95 percent of you. There may be one or two of you who are brilliant jelly bean guessers, but for the most part the group's guess would be better than just about all of you. And what's fascinating is that you can see this phenomenon at work in many more complicated situations.For instance, if you look at the odds on horses at a racetrack, they predict almost perfectly how likely a horse is to win. In a sense, the group of betters at the racetrack is forecasting the future, in probabilistic terms. You know, if you think about something like Google, which essentially is relying on the collective intelligence of the Web to seek out those sites that have the most valuable information \u2014 we know that Google does an exceptionally good job of doing that, and it does that because, collectively, this disorganized thing we call the \"World Wide Web\" actually has a remarkable order, or a remarkable intelligence in it. And this, I think, is one of the real promises of the blogosphere.Dan Gillmor \u2014 whose book \"We the Media\" is included in the gift pack \u2014 has talked about it as saying that, as a writer, he's recognized that his readers know more than he does. And this is a very challenging idea. It's a very challenging idea to mainstream media. It's a very challenging idea to anyone who has invested an enormous amount of time and expertise, and who has a lot of energy invested in the notion that he or she knows better than everyone else. But what the blogosphere offers is the possibility of getting at the kind of collective, distributive intelligence that is out there, and that we know is available to us if we can just figure out a way of accessing it. Each blog post, each blog commentary may not, in and of itself, be exactly what we're looking for, but collectively the judgment of those people posting, those people linking, more often than not is going to give you a very interesting and enormously valuable picture of what's going on. So, that's the positive side of it. That's the positive side of what is sometimes called participatory journalism or citizen journalism, etc. \u2014 that, in fact, we are giving people who have never been able to talk before a voice, and we're able to access information that has always been there but has essentially gone untapped.But there is a dark side to this, and that's what I want to spend the last part of my talk on. One of the things that happens if you spend a lot of time on the Internet, and you spend a lot of time thinking about the Internet, is that it is very easy to fall in love with the Internet. It is very easy to fall in love with the decentralized, bottom-up structure of the Internet. It is very easy to think that networks are necessarily good things \u2014 that being linked from one place to another, that being tightly linked in a group, is a very good thing. And much of the time it is. But there's also a downside to this \u2014 a kind of dark side, in fact \u2014 and that is that the more tightly linked we've become to each other, the harder it is for each of us to remain independent.One of the fundamental characteristics of a network is that, once you are linked in the network, the network starts to shape your views and starts to shape your interactions with everybody else. That's one of the things that defines what a network is. A network is not just the product of its component parts. It is something more than that. It is, as Steven Johnson has talked about, an emergent phenomenon. Now, this has all these benefits: it's very beneficial in terms of the efficiency of communicating information; it gives you access to a whole host of people; it allows people to coordinate their activities in very good ways. But the problem is that groups are only smart when the people in them are as independent as possible. This is the paradox of the wisdom of crowds, or the paradox of collective intelligence, that what it requires is actually a form of independent thinking. And networks make it harder for people to do that, because they drive attention to the things that the network values.So, one of the phenomena that's very clear in the blogosphere is that once a meme, once an idea gets going, it is very easy for people to just sort of pile on, because other people have, say, a link. People have linked to it, and so other people in turn link to it, etc., etc. And that phenomenon of piling on the existing links is one that is characteristic of the blogosphere, particularly of the political blogosphere, and it is one that essentially throws off this beautiful, decentralized, bottom-up intelligence that blogs can manifest in the right conditions.The metaphor that I like to use is the metaphor of the circular mill. A lot of people talk about ants. You know, this is a conference inspired by nature. When we talk about bottom-up, decentralized phenomena, the ant colony is the classic metaphor, because, no individual ant knows what it's doing, but collectively ants are able to reach incredibly intelligent decisions. They're able to reach food as efficiently as possible, they're able to guide their traffic with remarkable speed. So, the ant colony is a great model: you have all these little parts that collectively add up to a great thing. But we know that occasionally ants go astray, and what happens is that, if army ants are wandering around and they get lost, they start to follow a simple rule \u2014 just do what the ant in front of you does. And what happens is that the ants eventually end up in a circle. And there's this famous example of one that was 1,200 feet long and lasted for two days, and the ants just kept marching around and around in a circle until they died. And that, I think, is a sort of thing to watch out for. That's the thing we have to fear \u2014 is that we're just going to keep marching around and around until we die.Now, I want to connect this back, though, to the tsunami, because one of the great things about the tsunami \u2014 in terms of the blogosphere's coverage, not in terms of the tsunami itself \u2014 is that it really did represent a genuine bottom-up phenomenon. You saw sites that had never existed before getting huge amounts of traffic. You saw people being able to offer up their independent points of view in a way that they hadn't before. There, you really did see the intelligence of the Web manifest itself. So, that's the upside. The circular mill is the downside. And I think that the former is what we really need to strive for.Thank you very much.

It was foaming over the reef.\n\n00:01:01.958 --> 00:01:05.958\nThe children managed to run back onto the tracks.\n\n00:01:05.958 --> 00:01:09.958\nNo one was lost there. But the water continued to climb.\n\n00:01:09.958 --> 00:01:12.958\nIn about two minutes, it had reached the level of the railroad tracks\n\n00:01:12.958 --> 00:01:16.958\nand was coming over it. We had run about 100 meters by this time.\n\n00:01:16.958 --> 00:01:18.958\nIt continued to rise.\n\n00:01:18.958 --> 00:01:23.958\nI saw an old man standing at his gate, knee-deep in water, refusing to move.\n\n00:01:23.958 --> 00:01:26.958\nHe said he'd lived his whole life there by the beach,\n\n00:01:26.958 --> 00:01:29.958\nand that he would rather die there than run.\n\n00:01:29.958 --> 00:01:32.958\nA boy broke away from his mother to run back into his house\n\n00:01:32.958 --> 00:01:35.958\nto get his dog, who was apparently afraid.\n\n00:01:35.958 --> 00:01:40.958\nAn old lady, crying, was carried out of her house and up the road by her son.\n\n00:01:40.958 --> 00:01:43.958\nThe slum built on the railroad reservation\n\n00:01:43.958 --> 00:01:47.958\nbetween the sea and the railroad tracks was completely swept away.\n\n00:01:47.958 --> 00:01:50.958\nSince this was a high-risk location, the police had warned the residents,\n\n00:01:50.958 --> 00:01:52.958\nand no one was there when the water rose.\n\n00:01:52.958 --> 00:01:56.958\nBut they had not had any time to evacuate any belongings.\n\n00:01:56.958 --> 00:02:00.958\nFor hours afterwards, the sea was strewn with bits of wood for miles around --\n\n00:02:00.958 --> 00:02:03.958\nall of this was from the houses in the slum.\n\n00:02:03.958 --> 00:02:07.958\nWhen the waters subsided, it was as if it had never existed.\n\n00:02:09.958 --> 00:02:11.958\nThis may seem hard to believe --\n\n00:02:11.958 --> 00:02:13.958\nunless you've been reading lots and lots of news reports --\n\n00:02:13.958 --> 00:02:17.958\nbut in many places, after the tsunami, villagers were still terrified.\n\n00:02:17.958 --> 00:02:20.958\nWhen what was a tranquil sea swallows up people, homes\n\n00:02:20.958 --> 00:02:22.958\nand long-tail boats -- mercilessly, without warning --\n\n00:02:22.958 --> 00:02:26.958\nand no one can tell you anything reliable about whether another one is coming,\n\n00:02:26.958 --> 00:02:29.958\nI'm not sure you'd want to calm down either.\n\n00:02:29.958 --> 00:02:31.958\nOne of the scariest things about the tsunami\n\n00:02:31.958 --> 00:02:35.958\nthat I've not seen mentioned is the complete lack of information.\n\n00:02:35.958 --> 00:02:38.958\nThis may seem minor, but it is terrifying to hear rumor after rumor\n\n00:02:38.958 --> 00:02:41.958\nafter rumor that another tidal wave, bigger than the last,\n\n00:02:41.958 --> 00:02:46.958\nwill be coming at exactly 1 p.m., or perhaps tonight, or perhaps ...\n\n00:02:46.958 --> 00:02:49.958\nYou don't even know if it is safe to go back down to the water,\n\n00:02:49.958 --> 00:02:51.958\nto catch a boat to the hospital.\n\n00:02:51.958 --> 00:02:53.958\nWe think that Phi Phi hospital was destroyed.\n\n00:02:53.958 --> 00:02:56.958\nWe think this boat is going to Phuket hospital,\n\n00:02:56.958 --> 00:02:58.958\nbut if it's too dangerous to land at its pier,\n\n00:02:58.958 --> 00:03:02.958\nthen perhaps it will go to Krabi instead, which is more protected.\n\n00:03:02.958 --> 00:03:05.958\nWe don't think another wave is coming right away.\n\n00:03:05.958 --> 00:03:07.958\nAt the Phi Phi Hill Resort,\n\n00:03:07.958 --> 00:03:10.958\nI was tucked into the corner furthest away from the television,\n\n00:03:10.958 --> 00:03:12.958\nbut I strained to listen for information.\n\n00:03:12.958 --> 00:03:15.958\nThey reported that there was an 8.5 magnitude earthquake in Sumatra,\n\n00:03:15.958 --> 00:03:17.958\nwhich triggered the massive tsunami.\n\n00:03:17.958 --> 00:03:19.958\nHaving this news was comforting in some small way\n\n00:03:19.958 --> 00:03:21.958\nto understand what had just happened to us.\n\n00:03:21.958 --> 00:03:24.958\nHowever, the report focused on what had already occurred\n\n00:03:24.958 --> 00:03:27.958\nand offered no information on what to expect now.\n\n00:03:27.958 --> 00:03:30.958\nIn general, everything was merely hearsay and rumor,\n\n00:03:30.958 --> 00:03:33.958\nand not a single person I spoke to for over 36 hours\n\n00:03:33.958 --> 00:03:36.958\nknew anything with any certainty.\n\n00:03:36.958 --> 00:03:42.958\nThose were two accounts of the Asian tsunami from two Internet blogs\n\n00:03:42.958 --> 00:03:45.958\nthat essentially sprang up after it occurred.\n\n00:03:45.958 --> 00:03:50.958\nI'm now going to show you two video segments from the tsunami\n\n00:03:50.958 --> 00:03:52.958\nthat also were shown on blogs.\n\n00:03:52.958 --> 00:03:54.958\nI should warn you, they're pretty powerful.\n\n00:03:54.958 --> 00:03:57.958\nOne from Thailand, and the second one from Phuket as well.\n\n00:03:58.958 --> 00:04:07.958\n(Screaming)\n\n00:04:12.958 --> 00:04:15.958\nVoice 1: It's coming in. It's coming again.\n\n00:04:15.958 --> 00:04:17.958\nVoice 2: It's coming again?\n\n00:04:17.958 --> 00:04:19.958\nVoice 1: Yeah. It's coming again.\n\n00:04:19.958 --> 00:04:23.958\nVoice 2: Come get inside here.\n\n00:04:23.958 --> 00:04:25.958\nVoice 1: It's coming again. Voice 2: New wave?\n\n00:04:28.958 --> 00:04:30.958\nVoice 1: It's coming again. New wave!\n\n00:04:33.958 --> 00:04:36.958\n[Unclear]\n\n00:04:37.958 --> 00:04:57.958\n(Screaming)\n\n00:04:58.958 --> 00:05:00.958\nThey called me out here.\n\n00:05:14.958 --> 00:05:19.958\nJames Surowiecki: Phew. Those were both on this site: waveofdestruction.org.\n\n00:05:20.958 --> 00:05:24.958\nIn the world of blogs, there's going to be before the tsunami and after the tsunami,\n\n00:05:24.958 --> 00:05:28.958\nbecause one of the things that happened in the wake of the tsunami was that,\n\n00:05:28.958 --> 00:05:30.958\nalthough initially -- that is, in that first day --\n\n00:05:30.958 --> 00:05:34.958\nthere was actually a kind of dearth of live reporting, there was a dearth of live video\n\n00:05:34.958 --> 00:05:36.958\nand some people complained about this.\n\n00:05:36.958 --> 00:05:39.958\nThey said, \"The blogsters let us down.\"\n\n00:05:39.958 --> 00:05:41.958\nWhat became very clear was that,\n\n00:05:41.958 --> 00:05:46.958\nwithin a few days, the outpouring of information was immense,\n\n00:05:46.958 --> 00:05:51.958\nand we got a complete and powerful picture of what had happened\n\n00:05:51.958 --> 00:05:54.958\nin a way that we never had been able to get before.\n\n00:05:54.958 --> 00:05:57.958\nAnd what you had was a group of essentially unorganized, unconnected\n\n00:05:57.958 --> 00:06:02.958\nwriters, video bloggers, etc., who were able to come up with\n\n00:06:02.958 --> 00:06:06.958\na collective portrait of a disaster that gave us a much better sense\n\n00:06:06.958 --> 00:06:11.958\nof what it was like to actually be there than the mainstream media could give us.\n\n00:06:11.958 --> 00:06:15.958\nAnd so in some ways the tsunami can be seen as a sort of seminal moment,\n\n00:06:15.958 --> 00:06:19.958\na moment in which the blogosphere came, to a certain degree, of age.\n\n00:06:21.958 --> 00:06:23.958\nNow, I'm going to move now from this kind of --\n\n00:06:23.958 --> 00:06:25.958\nthe sublime in the traditional sense of the word,\n\n00:06:25.958 --> 00:06:30.958\nthat is to say, awe-inspiring, terrifying -- to the somewhat more mundane.\n\n00:06:30.958 --> 00:06:32.958\nBecause when we think about blogs,\n\n00:06:32.958 --> 00:06:35.958\nI think for most of us who are concerned about them,\n\n00:06:35.958 --> 00:06:40.958\nwe're primarily concerned with things like politics, technology, etc.\n\n00:06:40.958 --> 00:06:42.958\nAnd I want to ask three questions in this talk,\n\n00:06:42.958 --> 00:06:45.958\nin the 10 minutes that remain, about the blogosphere.\n\n00:06:46.958 --> 00:06:49.958\nThe first one is, What does it tell us about our ideas,\n\n00:06:49.958 --> 00:06:51.958\nabout what motivates people to do things?\n\n00:06:51.958 --> 00:06:55.958\nThe second is, Do blogs genuinely have the possibility\n\n00:06:55.958 --> 00:06:59.958\nof accessing a kind of collective intelligence\n\n00:06:59.958 --> 00:07:02.958\nthat has previously remained, for the most part, untapped?\n\n00:07:02.958 --> 00:07:06.958\nAnd then the third part is, What are the potential problems,\n\n00:07:06.958 --> 00:07:10.958\nor the dark side of blogs as we know them?\n\n00:07:10.958 --> 00:07:12.958\nOK, the first question:\n\n00:07:12.958 --> 00:07:14.958\nWhat do they tell us about why people do things?\n\n00:07:14.958 --> 00:07:17.958\nOne of the fascinating things about the blogosphere specifically,\n\n00:07:17.958 --> 00:07:20.958\nand, of course, the Internet more generally --\n\n00:07:20.958 --> 00:07:22.958\nand it's going to seem like a very obvious point,\n\n00:07:22.958 --> 00:07:24.958\nbut I think it is an important one to think about --\n\n00:07:24.958 --> 00:07:28.958\nis that the people who are generating these enormous reams of content\n\n00:07:28.958 --> 00:07:33.958\nevery day, who are spending enormous amounts of time organizing,\n\n00:07:33.958 --> 00:07:36.958\nlinking, commenting on the substance of the Internet,\n\n00:07:36.958 --> 00:07:39.958\nare doing so primarily for free.\n\n00:07:39.958 --> 00:07:43.958\nThey are not getting paid for it in any way other than in the attention and,\n\n00:07:43.958 --> 00:07:48.958\nto some extent, the reputational capital that they gain from doing a good job.\n\n00:07:48.958 --> 00:07:53.958\nAnd this is -- at least, to a traditional economist -- somewhat remarkable,\n\n00:07:53.958 --> 00:07:57.958\nbecause the traditional account of economic man would say that,\n\n00:07:57.958 --> 00:08:02.958\nbasically, you do things for a concrete reward, primarily financial.\n\n00:08:02.958 --> 00:08:05.958\nBut instead, what we're finding on the Internet --\n\n00:08:05.958 --> 00:08:09.958\nand one of the great geniuses of it -- is that people have found a way\n\n00:08:09.958 --> 00:08:12.958\nto work together without any money involved at all.\n\n00:08:12.958 --> 00:08:17.958\nThey have come up with, in a sense, a different method for organizing activity.\n\n00:08:17.958 --> 00:08:22.958\nThe Yale Law professor Yochai Benkler, in an essay called \"Coase's Penguin,\"\n\n00:08:22.958 --> 00:08:26.958\ntalks about this open-source model, which we're familiar with from Linux,\n\n00:08:26.958 --> 00:08:29.958\nas being potentially applicable in a whole host of situations.\n\n00:08:29.958 --> 00:08:31.958\nAnd, you know, if you think about this with the tsunami,\n\n00:08:31.958 --> 00:08:35.958\nwhat you have is essentially a kind of an army of local journalists,\n\n00:08:35.958 --> 00:08:38.958\nwho are producing enormous amounts of material\n\n00:08:38.958 --> 00:08:40.958\nfor no reason other than to tell their stories.\n\n00:08:40.958 --> 00:08:44.958\nThat's a very powerful idea, and it's a very powerful reality.\n\n00:08:44.958 --> 00:08:46.958\nAnd it's one that offers really interesting possibilities\n\n00:08:46.958 --> 00:08:52.958\nfor organizing a whole host of activities down the road.\n\n00:08:52.958 --> 00:08:55.958\nSo, I think the first thing that the blogosphere tells us\n\n00:08:55.958 --> 00:08:58.958\nis that we need to expand our idea of what counts as rational,\n\n00:08:58.958 --> 00:09:02.958\nand we need to expand our simple equation of value equals money,\n\n00:09:02.958 --> 00:09:04.958\nor, you have to pay for it to be good,\n\n00:09:04.958 --> 00:09:07.958\nbut that in fact you can end up with collectively really brilliant products\n\n00:09:07.958 --> 00:09:10.958\nwithout any money at all changing hands.\n\n00:09:10.958 --> 00:09:13.958\nThere are a few bloggers -- somewhere maybe around 20, now --\n\n00:09:13.958 --> 00:09:16.958\nwho do, in fact, make some kind of money, and a few\n\n00:09:16.958 --> 00:09:19.958\nwho are actually trying to make a full-time living out of it,\n\n00:09:19.958 --> 00:09:21.958\nbut the vast majority of them are doing it because they love it\n\n00:09:21.958 --> 00:09:23.958\nor they love the attention, or whatever it is.\n\n00:09:23.958 --> 00:09:25.958\nSo, Howard Rheingold has written a lot about this\n\n00:09:25.958 --> 00:09:27.958\nand, I think, is writing about this more,\n\n00:09:27.958 --> 00:09:30.958\nbut this notion of voluntary cooperation\n\n00:09:30.958 --> 00:09:33.958\nis an incredibly powerful one, and one worth thinking about.\n\n00:09:33.958 --> 00:09:38.958\nThe second question is, What does the blogosphere actually do for us,\n\n00:09:38.958 --> 00:09:41.958\nin terms of accessing collective intelligence?\n\n00:09:41.958 --> 00:09:44.958\nYou know, as Chris mentioned, I wrote a book called \"The Wisdom of Crowds.\"\n\n00:09:44.958 --> 00:09:47.958\nAnd the premise of \"The Wisdom of Crowds\" is that,\n\n00:09:47.958 --> 00:09:51.958\nunder the right conditions, groups can be remarkably intelligent.\n\n00:09:51.958 --> 00:09:53.958\nAnd they can actually often be smarter\n\n00:09:53.958 --> 00:09:55.958\nthan even the smartest person within them.\n\n00:09:55.958 --> 00:09:58.958\nThe simplest example of this is if you ask a group of people\n\n00:09:58.958 --> 00:10:02.958\nto do something like guess how many jellybeans are in a jar.\n\n00:10:02.958 --> 00:10:04.958\nIf I had a jar of jellybeans\n\n00:10:04.958 --> 00:10:07.958\nand I asked you all to guess how many jellybeans were in that jar,\n\n00:10:07.958 --> 00:10:10.958\nyour average guess would be remarkably good.\n\n00:10:10.958 --> 00:10:12.958\nIt would be somewhere probably within three and five percent\n\n00:10:12.958 --> 00:10:14.958\nof the number of beans in the jar,\n\n00:10:14.958 --> 00:10:19.958\nand it would be better than 90 to 95 percent of you.\n\n00:10:19.958 --> 00:10:22.958\nThere may be one or two of you who are brilliant jelly bean guessers,\n\n00:10:22.958 --> 00:10:25.958\nbut for the most part the group's guess\n\n00:10:25.958 --> 00:10:27.958\nwould be better than just about all of you.\n\n00:10:27.958 --> 00:10:30.958\nAnd what's fascinating is that you can see this phenomenon at work\n\n00:10:30.958 --> 00:10:33.958\nin many more complicated situations.\n\n00:10:33.958 --> 00:10:36.958\nFor instance, if you look at the odds on horses at a racetrack,\n\n00:10:36.958 --> 00:10:41.958\nthey predict almost perfectly how likely a horse is to win.\n\n00:10:41.958 --> 00:10:44.958\nIn a sense, the group of betters at the racetrack\n\n00:10:44.958 --> 00:10:48.958\nis forecasting the future, in probabilistic terms.\n\n00:10:48.958 --> 00:10:50.958\nYou know, if you think about something like Google,\n\n00:10:50.958 --> 00:10:54.958\nwhich essentially is relying on the collective intelligence of the Web\n\n00:10:54.958 --> 00:10:58.958\nto seek out those sites that have the most valuable information --\n\n00:10:58.958 --> 00:11:01.958\nwe know that Google does an exceptionally good job of doing that,\n\n00:11:01.958 --> 00:11:04.958\nand it does that because, collectively, this disorganized thing\n\n00:11:04.958 --> 00:11:08.958\nwe call the \"World Wide Web\" actually has a remarkable order,\n\n00:11:08.958 --> 00:11:10.958\nor a remarkable intelligence in it.\n\n00:11:11.958 --> 00:11:14.958\nAnd this, I think, is one of the real promises of the blogosphere.\n\n00:11:14.958 --> 00:11:16.958\nDan Gillmor -- whose book \"We the Media\"\n\n00:11:16.958 --> 00:11:18.958\nis included in the gift pack --\n\n00:11:18.958 --> 00:11:21.958\nhas talked about it as saying that, as a writer,\n\n00:11:21.958 --> 00:11:25.958\nhe's recognized that his readers know more than he does.\n\n00:11:25.958 --> 00:11:28.958\nAnd this is a very challenging idea. It's a very challenging idea\n\n00:11:28.958 --> 00:11:30.958\nto mainstream media. It's a very challenging idea to anyone\n\n00:11:30.958 --> 00:11:34.958\nwho has invested an enormous amount of time and expertise,\n\n00:11:34.958 --> 00:11:37.958\nand who has a lot of energy invested in the notion\n\n00:11:37.958 --> 00:11:41.958\nthat he or she knows better than everyone else.\n\n00:11:42.958 --> 00:11:45.958\nBut what the blogosphere offers is the possibility\n\n00:11:45.958 --> 00:11:50.958\nof getting at the kind of collective, distributive intelligence that is out there,\n\n00:11:50.958 --> 00:11:52.958\nand that we know is available to us\n\n00:11:52.958 --> 00:11:56.958\nif we can just figure out a way of accessing it.\n\n00:11:56.958 --> 00:11:59.958\nEach blog post, each blog commentary\n\n00:11:59.958 --> 00:12:03.958\nmay not, in and of itself, be exactly what we're looking for,\n\n00:12:03.958 --> 00:12:08.958\nbut collectively the judgment of those people posting, those people linking,\n\n00:12:08.958 --> 00:12:12.958\nmore often than not is going to give you a very interesting\n\n00:12:12.958 --> 00:12:15.958\nand enormously valuable picture of what's going on.\n\n00:12:15.958 --> 00:12:17.958\nSo, that's the positive side of it.\n\n00:12:17.958 --> 00:12:19.958\nThat's the positive side of what is sometimes called\n\n00:12:19.958 --> 00:12:24.958\nparticipatory journalism or citizen journalism, etc. --\n\n00:12:24.958 --> 00:12:27.958\nthat, in fact, we are giving people\n\n00:12:27.958 --> 00:12:30.958\nwho have never been able to talk before a voice,\n\n00:12:30.958 --> 00:12:33.958\nand we're able to access information that has always been there\n\n00:12:33.958 --> 00:12:36.958\nbut has essentially gone untapped.\n\n00:12:36.958 --> 00:12:38.958\nBut there is a dark side to this,\n\n00:12:38.958 --> 00:12:41.958\nand that's what I want to spend the last part of my talk on.\n\n00:12:41.958 --> 00:12:44.958\nOne of the things that happens if you spend a lot of time on the Internet,\n\n00:12:44.958 --> 00:12:46.958\nand you spend a lot of time thinking about the Internet,\n\n00:12:46.958 --> 00:12:50.958\nis that it is very easy to fall in love with the Internet.\n\n00:12:50.958 --> 00:12:53.958\nIt is very easy to fall in love with the decentralized,\n\n00:12:53.958 --> 00:12:55.958\nbottom-up structure of the Internet.\n\n00:12:55.958 --> 00:13:00.958\nIt is very easy to think that networks are necessarily good things --\n\n00:13:00.958 --> 00:13:02.958\nthat being linked from one place to another,\n\n00:13:02.958 --> 00:13:06.958\nthat being tightly linked in a group, is a very good thing.\n\n00:13:06.958 --> 00:13:08.958\nAnd much of the time it is.\n\n00:13:08.958 --> 00:13:12.958\nBut there's also a downside to this -- a kind of dark side, in fact --\n\n00:13:12.958 --> 00:13:16.958\nand that is that the more tightly linked we've become to each other,\n\n00:13:16.958 --> 00:13:20.958\nthe harder it is for each of us to remain independent.\n\n00:13:20.958 --> 00:13:23.958\nOne of the fundamental characteristics of a network is that,\n\n00:13:23.958 --> 00:13:25.958\nonce you are linked in the network,\n\n00:13:25.958 --> 00:13:28.958\nthe network starts to shape your views\n\n00:13:28.958 --> 00:13:31.958\nand starts to shape your interactions with everybody else.\n\n00:13:31.958 --> 00:13:33.958\nThat's one of the things that defines what a network is.\n\n00:13:33.958 --> 00:13:37.958\nA network is not just the product of its component parts.\n\n00:13:37.958 --> 00:13:40.958\nIt is something more than that.\n\n00:13:40.958 --> 00:13:44.958\nIt is, as Steven Johnson has talked about, an emergent phenomenon.\n\n00:13:44.958 --> 00:13:46.958\nNow, this has all these benefits:\n\n00:13:46.958 --> 00:13:49.958\nit's very beneficial in terms of the efficiency of communicating information;\n\n00:13:49.958 --> 00:13:52.958\nit gives you access to a whole host of people;\n\n00:13:52.958 --> 00:13:55.958\nit allows people to coordinate their activities in very good ways.\n\n00:13:55.958 --> 00:13:59.958\nBut the problem is that groups are only smart\n\n00:13:59.958 --> 00:14:03.958\nwhen the people in them are as independent as possible.\n\n00:14:03.958 --> 00:14:06.958\nThis is the paradox of the wisdom of crowds,\n\n00:14:06.958 --> 00:14:08.958\nor the paradox of collective intelligence,\n\n00:14:08.958 --> 00:14:13.958\nthat what it requires is actually a form of independent thinking.\n\n00:14:13.958 --> 00:14:17.958\nAnd networks make it harder for people to do that,\n\n00:14:17.958 --> 00:14:21.958\nbecause they drive attention to the things that the network values.\n\n00:14:21.958 --> 00:14:25.958\nSo, one of the phenomena that's very clear in the blogosphere\n\n00:14:25.958 --> 00:14:29.958\nis that once a meme, once an idea gets going,\n\n00:14:29.958 --> 00:14:32.958\nit is very easy for people to just sort of pile on,\n\n00:14:32.958 --> 00:14:35.958\nbecause other people have, say, a link.\n\n00:14:35.958 --> 00:14:38.958\nPeople have linked to it, and so other people in turn link to it, etc., etc.\n\n00:14:38.958 --> 00:14:41.958\nAnd that phenomenon\n\n00:14:41.958 --> 00:14:44.958\nof piling on the existing links\n\n00:14:44.958 --> 00:14:47.958\nis one that is characteristic of the blogosphere,\n\n00:14:47.958 --> 00:14:50.958\nparticularly of the political blogosphere,\n\n00:14:50.958 --> 00:14:53.958\nand it is one that essentially throws off\n\n00:14:53.958 --> 00:14:56.958\nthis beautiful, decentralized, bottom-up intelligence\n\n00:14:56.958 --> 00:14:59.958\nthat blogs can manifest in the right conditions.\n\n00:14:59.958 --> 00:15:03.958\nThe metaphor that I like to use is the metaphor of the circular mill.\n\n00:15:03.958 --> 00:15:05.958\nA lot of people talk about ants.\n\n00:15:05.958 --> 00:15:07.958\nYou know, this is a conference inspired by nature.\n\n00:15:07.958 --> 00:15:10.958\nWhen we talk about bottom-up, decentralized phenomena,\n\n00:15:10.958 --> 00:15:14.958\nthe ant colony is the classic metaphor, because,\n\n00:15:14.958 --> 00:15:16.958\nno individual ant knows what it's doing,\n\n00:15:16.958 --> 00:15:22.632\nbut collectively ants are able to reach incredibly intelligent decisions.\n\n00:15:22.751 --> 00:15:25.807\nThey're able to reach food\nas efficiently as possible,\n\n00:15:25.832 --> 00:15:29.858\nthey're able to guide their traffic\nwith remarkable speed.\n\n00:15:29.958 --> 00:15:31.958\nSo, the ant colony is a great model:\n\n00:15:31.958 --> 00:15:34.958\nyou have all these little parts that collectively add up to a great thing.\n\n00:15:34.958 --> 00:15:38.958\nBut we know that occasionally ants go astray,\n\n00:15:38.958 --> 00:15:42.958\nand what happens is that, if army ants are wandering around and they get lost,\n\n00:15:42.958 --> 00:15:44.958\nthey start to follow a simple rule --\n\n00:15:44.958 --> 00:15:48.958\njust do what the ant in front of you does.\n\n00:15:48.958 --> 00:15:52.958\nAnd what happens is that the ants eventually end up in a circle.\n\n00:15:52.958 --> 00:15:56.958\nAnd there's this famous example of one that was 1,200 feet long\n\n00:15:56.958 --> 00:16:00.958\nand lasted for two days, and the ants just kept marching around and around\n\n00:16:00.958 --> 00:16:03.958\nin a circle until they died.\n\n00:16:03.958 --> 00:16:06.958\nAnd that, I think, is a sort of thing to watch out for.\n\n00:16:06.958 --> 00:16:08.958\nThat's the thing we have to fear --\n\n00:16:08.958 --> 00:16:12.958\nis that we're just going to keep marching around and around until we die.\n\n00:16:12.958 --> 00:16:15.958\nNow, I want to connect this back, though, to the tsunami,\n\n00:16:15.958 --> 00:16:17.958\nbecause one of the great things about the tsunami --\n\n00:16:17.958 --> 00:16:19.958\nin terms of the blogosphere's coverage,\n\n00:16:19.958 --> 00:16:21.958\nnot in terms of the tsunami itself --\n\n00:16:21.958 --> 00:16:25.958\nis that it really did represent a genuine bottom-up phenomenon.\n\n00:16:25.958 --> 00:16:28.958\nYou saw sites that had never existed before getting huge amounts of traffic.\n\n00:16:28.958 --> 00:16:32.958\nYou saw people being able to offer up\ntheir independent points of view\n\n00:16:32.958 --> 00:16:34.958\nin a way that they hadn't before.\n\n00:16:34.958 --> 00:16:39.958\nThere, you really did see the intelligence of the Web manifest itself.\n\n00:16:39.958 --> 00:16:42.958\nSo, that's the upside. The circular mill is the downside.\n\n00:16:42.958 --> 00:16:45.958\nAnd I think that the former is what we really need to strive for.\n\n00:16:45.958 --> 00:16:47.140\nThank you very much. (Applause)"}, {"title": "Walk the earth ... my 17-year vow of silence", "duration": "1164", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/john_francis_walks_the_earth", "transcript": "(Music)(Applause)Thank you for being here. And I say \"thank you for being here\" because I was silent for 17 years. And the first words that I spoke were in Washington, D.C., on the 20th anniversary of Earth Day. And my family and friends had gathered there to hear me speak. And I said, \"Thank you for being here.\" My mother, out in the audience, she jumped up, \"Hallelujah, Johnny\u2019s talking!\"(Laughter)Imagine if you were quiet for 17 years and your mother was out in the audience, say. My dad said to me, \"That\u2019s one\" \u2014 I\u2019ll explain that. But I turned around because I didn\u2019t recognize where my voice was coming from. I hadn\u2019t heard my voice in 17 years, so I turned around and I looked and I said, \"God, who's saying what I\u2019m thinking?\" And then I realized it was me, you know, and I kind of laughed. And I could see my father: \"Yeah, he really is crazy.\" Well, I want to take you on this journey. And the journey, I believe, is a metaphor for all of our journeys. Even though this one is kind of unusual, I want you to think about your own journey.My journey began in 1971 when I witnessed two oil tankers collide beneath the Golden Gate, and a half a million gallons of oil spilled into the bay. It disturbed me so much that I decided that I was going to give up riding and driving in motorized vehicles. That\u2019s a big thing in California. And it was a big thing in my little community of Point Reyes Station in Inverness, California, because there were only about 350 people there in the winter \u2013 this was back in '71 now. And so when I came in and I started walking around, people \u2014 they just knew what was going on. And people would drive up next to me and say, \"John, what are you doing?\" And I\u2019d say, \"Well, I\u2019m walking for the environment.\" And they said, \"No, you\u2019re walking to make us look bad, right? You\u2019re walking to make us feel bad.\" And maybe there was some truth to that, because I thought that if I started walking, everyone would follow. Because of the oil, everybody talked about the polllution. And so I argued with people about that, I argued and I argued. I called my parents up. I said, \"I\u2019ve given up riding and driving in cars.\" My dad said, \"Why didn\u2019t you do that when you were 16?\"(Laughter)I didn\u2019t know about the environment then. They\u2019re back in Philadelphia. And so I told my mother, \"I\u2019m happy though, I\u2019m really happy.\" She said, \"If you were happy, son, you wouldn\u2019t have to say it.\" Mothers are like that.And so, on my 27th birthday I decided, because I argued so much and I talk so much, that I was going to stop speaking for just one day \u2014 one day \u2014 to give it a rest. And so I did. I got up in the morning and I didn\u2019t say a word. And I have to tell you, it was a very moving experience, because for the first time, I began listening \u2014 in a long time. And what I heard, it kind of disturbed me. Because what I used to do, when I thought I was listening, was I would listen just enough to hear what people had to say and think that I could \u2014 I knew what they were going to say, and so I stopped listening. And in my mind, I just kind of raced ahead and thought of what I was going to say back, while they were still finishing up. And then I would launch in. Well, that just ended communication.So on this first day I actually listened. And it was very sad for me, because I realized that for those many years I had not been learning. I was 27. I thought I knew everything. I didn\u2019t. And so I decided I\u2019d better do this for another day, and another day, and another day until finally, I promised myself for a year I would keep quiet because I started learning more and more and I needed to learn more. So for a year I said I would keep quiet, and then on my birthday I would reassess what I had learned and maybe I would talk again. Well, that lasted 17 years.Now during that time \u2014 those 17 years \u2014 I walked and I played the banjo and I painted and I wrote in my journal, and I tried to study the environment by reading books. And I decided that I was going to go to school. So I did. I walked up to Ashland, Oregon, where they were offering an environmental studies degree. It\u2019s only 500 miles. And I went into the Registrar\u2019s office and \u2014 \"What, what, what?\" I had a newspaper clipping. \"Oh, so you really want to go to school here? You don\u2019t \u2026? We have a special program for you.\" They did. And in those two years, I graduated with my first degree \u2014 a bachelor\u2019s degree. And my father came out, he was so proud. He said, \"Listen, we\u2019re really proud of you son, but what are you going to do with a bachelor\u2019s degree? You don\u2019t ride in cars, you don\u2019t talk \u2014 you\u2019re going to have to do those things.\"(Laughter)I hunched my shoulder, I picked my backpack up again and I started walking. I walked all the way up to Port Townsend, Washington, where I built a wooden boat, rode it across Puget Sound and walked across Washington [to] Idaho and down to Missoula, Montana. I had written the University of Montana two years earlier and said I'd like to go to school there. I said I'd be there in about two years.(Laughter)And I was there. I showed up in two years and they \u2014 I tell this story because they really helped me. There are two stories in Montana. The first story is I didn\u2019t have any money \u2014 that\u2019s a sign I used a lot. And they said,\"Don't worry about that.\" The director of the program said, \"Come back tomorrow.\" He gave me 150 dollars, and he said, \"Register for one credit. You\u2019re going to go to South America, aren\u2019t you?\" And I said \u2014 Rivers and lakes, the hydrological systems, South America. So I did that. He came back; he said to me, \"OK John, now that you've registered for that one credit, you can have a key to an office, you can matriculate \u2014 you\u2019re matriculating, so you can use the library. And what we\u2019re going to do is, we\u2019re going to have all of the professors allow you to go to class. They\u2019re going to save your grade, and when we figure out how to get you the rest of the money, then you can register for that class and they\u2019ll give you the grade.\" Wow, they don\u2019t do that in graduate schools, I don\u2019t think. But I use that story because they really wanted to help me. They saw that I was really interested in the environment, and they really wanted to help me along the way.And during that time, I actually taught classes without speaking. I had 13 students when I first walked into the class. I explained, with a friend who could interpret my sign language, that I was John Francis, I was walking around the world, I didn\u2019t talk and this was the last time this person\u2019s going to be here interpreting for me. All the students sat around and they went ...(Laughter)I could see they were looking for the schedule, to see when they could get out. They had to take that class with me. Two weeks later, everyone was trying to get into our class.And I learned in that class \u2014 because I would do things like this ... and they were all gathered around, going, \"What's he trying to say?\" \"I don't know, I think he's talking about clear cutting.\" \"Yeah, clear cutting.\" \"No, no, no, that's not clear cutting, that\u2019s \u2014 he's using a handsaw.\" \"Well, you can\u2019t clearcut with a ...\" \"Yes, you can clear cut ...\" \"No, I think he\u2019s talking about selective forestry.\" Now this was a discussion class and we were having a discussion. I just backed out of that, you know, and I just kind of kept the fists from flying. But what I learned was that sometimes I would make a sign and they said things that I absolutely did not mean, but I should have. And so what came to me is, if you were a teacher and you were teaching, if you weren\u2019t learning you probably weren\u2019t teaching very well. And so I went on.My dad came out to see me graduate and, you know, I did the deal, and my father said, \"We\u2019re really proud of you son, but ... \" You know what went on, he said, \"You\u2019ve got to start riding and driving and start talking. What are you going to do with a master\u2019s degree?\" I hunched my shoulder, I got my backpack and I went on to the University of Wisconsin.I spent two years there writing on oil spills. No one was interested in oil spills. But something happened \u2014 Exxon Valdez. And I was the only one in the United States writing on oil spills. My dad came out again. He said, \"I don't know how you do this, son \u2014 I mean, you don't ride in cars, you don\u2019t talk. My sister said maybe I should leave you alone, because you seem to be doing a lot better when you\u2019re not saying anything.\"(Laughter)Well, I put on my backpack again. I put my banjo on and I walked all the way to the East Coast, put my foot in the Atlantic Ocean \u2014 it was seven years and one day it took me to walk across the United States.And on Earth Day, 1990 \u2014 the 20th anniversary of Earth Day \u2014 that\u2019s when I began to speak. And that\u2019s why I said, \"Thank you for being here.\" Because it's sort of like that tree in the forest falling; and if there's no one there to hear, does it really make a sound? And I\u2019m thanking you, and I'm thanking my family because they had come to hear me speak. And that\u2019s communication. And they also taught me about listening \u2014 that they listened to me. And it\u2019s one of those things that came out of the silence, the listening to each other. Really, very important \u2014 we need to listen to each other. Well, my journey kept going on. My dad said, \"That\u2019s one,\" and I still didn\u2019t let that go.I worked for the Coastguard, was made a U.N. Goodwill Ambassador. I wrote regulations for the United States \u2014 I mean, I wrote oil spill regulations. 20 years ago, if someone had said to me, \"John, do you really want to make a difference?\" \"Yeah, I want to make a difference.\" He said, \"You just start walking east; get out of your car and just start walking east.\" And as I walked off a little bit, they'd say, \"Yeah, and shut up, too.\"(Laughter)\"You\u2019re going to make a difference, buddy.\" How could that be, how could that be? How could doing such a simple thing like walking and not talking make a difference?Well, my time at the Coast Guard was a really good time. And after that \u2014 I only worked one year \u2014 I said, \"That's enough. One year's enough for me to do that.\" I got on a sailboat and I sailed down to the Caribbean, and walked through all of the islands, and to Venezuela. And you know, I forgot the most important thing, which is why I started talking, which I have to tell you. I started talking because I had studied environment. I\u2019d studied environment at this formal level, but there was this informal level. And the informal level \u2014 I learned about people, and what we do and how we are. And environment changed from just being about trees and birds and endangered species to being about how we treated each other. Because if we are the environment, then all we need to do is look around us and see how we treat ourselves and how we treat each other. And so that\u2019s the message that I had. And I said, \"Well, I'm going to have to spread that message.\" And I got in my sailboat, sailed all the way through the Caribbean \u2014 it wasn't really my sailboat, I kind of worked on that boat \u2014 got to Venezuela and I started walking.This is the last part of this story, because it\u2019s how I got here, because I still didn't ride in motorized vehicles. I was walking through El Dorado \u2014 it's a prison town, famous prison, or infamous prison \u2014 in Venezuela, and I don\u2019t know what possessed me, because this was not like me. There I am, walking past the guard gate and the guard stops and says, \"Pasaporte, pasaporte,\" and with an M16 pointed at me. And I looked at him and I said, \"Passport, huh? I don't need to show you my passport. It\u2019s in the back of my pack. I'm Dr. Francis; I'm a U.N. Ambassador and I'm walking around the world.\" And I started walking off. What possessed me to say this thing? The road turned into the jungle. I didn\u2019t get shot. And I got to \u2014 I start saying, \"Free at last \u2014 thank God Almighty, I\u2019m free at last.\" \"What was that about,\" I\u2019m saying. What was that about?It took me 100 miles to figure out that, in my heart, in me, I had become a prisoner. I was a prisoner and I needed to escape. The prison that I was in was the fact that I did not drive or use motorized vehicles. Now how could that be? Because when I started, it seemed very appropriate to me not to use motorized vehicles. But the thing that was different was that every birthday, I asked myself about silence, but I never asked myself about my decision to just use my feet. I had no idea I was going to become a U.N. Ambassador. I had no idea I would have a Ph.D.And so I realized that I had a responsibility to more than just me, and that I was going to have to change. You know, we can do it. I was going to have to change. And I was afraid to change, because I was so used to the guy who only just walked. I was so used to that person that I didn\u2019t want to stop. I didn\u2019t know who I would be if I changed. But I know I needed to. I know I needed to change, because it would be the only way that I could be here today. And I know that a lot of times we find ourselves in this wonderful place where we\u2019ve gotten to, but there\u2019s another place for us to go. And we kind of have to leave behind the security of who we\u2019ve become, and go to the place of who we are becoming. And so, I want to encourage you to go to that next place, to let yourself out of any prison that you might find yourself in, as comfortable as it may be, because we have to do something now. We have to change now. As our former Vice President said, we have to become activists. So if my voice can touch you, if my actions can touch you, if my being here can touch you, please let it be. And I know that all of you have touched me while I\u2019ve been here.So, let\u2019s go out into the world and take this caring, this love, this respect that we\u2019ve shown each other right here at TED, and take this out into the world. Because we are the environment, and how we treat each other is really how we\u2019re going to treat the environment. So I want to thank you for being here and I want to end this in five seconds of silence.Thank you.(Applause)", "id": 391, "subtitle":

here.\n\n00:01:03.958 --> 00:01:11.958\nAnd I say \"thank you for being here\" because I was silent for 17 years.\n\n00:01:11.958 --> 00:01:15.958\nAnd the first words that I spoke were in Washington, D.C.,\n\n00:01:15.958 --> 00:01:17.958\non the 20th anniversary of Earth Day.\n\n00:01:17.958 --> 00:01:22.958\nAnd my family and friends had gathered there to hear me speak.\n\n00:01:22.958 --> 00:01:26.958\nAnd I said, \"Thank you for being here.\"\n\n00:01:26.958 --> 00:01:27.958\nMy mother, out in the audience, she jumped up,\n\n00:01:27.958 --> 00:01:30.958\n\"Hallelujah, Johnny\u2019s talking!\"\n\n00:01:30.958 --> 00:01:32.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:01:32.958 --> 00:01:34.958\nImagine if you were quiet for 17 years\n\n00:01:34.958 --> 00:01:38.958\nand your mother was out in the audience, say.\n\n00:01:38.958 --> 00:01:41.958\nMy dad said to me, \"That\u2019s one\" --\n\n00:01:41.958 --> 00:01:44.958\nI\u2019ll explain that.\n\n00:01:44.958 --> 00:01:49.958\nBut I turned around because I didn\u2019t recognize where my voice was coming from.\n\n00:01:49.958 --> 00:01:52.958\nI hadn\u2019t heard my voice in 17 years,\n\n00:01:52.958 --> 00:01:54.958\nso I turned around and I looked and I said,\n\n00:01:54.958 --> 00:01:58.958\n\"God, who's saying what I\u2019m thinking?\"\n\n00:01:58.958 --> 00:02:03.958\nAnd then I realized it was me, you know, and I kind of laughed.\n\n00:02:03.958 --> 00:02:08.958\nAnd I could see my father: \"Yeah, he really is crazy.\"\n\n00:02:08.958 --> 00:02:12.958\nWell, I want to take you on this journey.\n\n00:02:12.958 --> 00:02:15.958\nAnd the journey, I believe, is a metaphor for all of our journeys.\n\n00:02:15.958 --> 00:02:19.958\nEven though this one is kind of unusual,\n\n00:02:19.958 --> 00:02:24.958\nI want you to think about your own journey.\n\n00:02:24.958 --> 00:02:28.958\nMy journey began in 1971\n\n00:02:28.958 --> 00:02:34.958\nwhen I witnessed two oil tankers collide beneath the Golden Gate,\n\n00:02:34.958 --> 00:02:38.958\nand a half a million gallons of oil spilled into the bay.\n\n00:02:38.958 --> 00:02:42.958\nIt disturbed me so much\n\n00:02:42.958 --> 00:02:48.958\nthat I decided that I was going to give up riding and driving in motorized vehicles.\n\n00:02:49.958 --> 00:02:52.958\nThat\u2019s a big thing in California.\n\n00:02:52.958 --> 00:02:58.958\nAnd it was a big thing in my little community of Point Reyes Station\n\n00:02:58.958 --> 00:03:00.958\nin Inverness, California, because there were only\n\n00:03:00.958 --> 00:03:06.958\nabout 350 people there in the winter \u2013 this was back in '71 now.\n\n00:03:06.958 --> 00:03:11.958\nAnd so when I came in and I started walking around, people --\n\n00:03:11.958 --> 00:03:13.958\nthey just knew what was going on.\n\n00:03:13.958 --> 00:03:15.958\nAnd people would drive up next to me\n\n00:03:15.958 --> 00:03:17.958\nand say, \"John, what are you doing?\"\n\n00:03:17.958 --> 00:03:21.958\nAnd I\u2019d say, \"Well, I\u2019m walking for the environment.\"\n\n00:03:21.958 --> 00:03:25.958\nAnd they said, \"No, you\u2019re walking to make us look bad, right?\n\n00:03:25.958 --> 00:03:27.958\nYou\u2019re walking to make us feel bad.\"\n\n00:03:27.958 --> 00:03:29.958\nAnd maybe there was some truth to that,\n\n00:03:29.958 --> 00:03:34.958\nbecause I thought that if I started walking, everyone would follow.\n\n00:03:34.958 --> 00:03:36.958\nBecause of the oil, everybody talked about the polllution.\n\n00:03:36.958 --> 00:03:43.958\nAnd so I argued with people about that, I argued and I argued.\n\n00:03:43.958 --> 00:03:45.958\nI called my parents up.\n\n00:03:45.958 --> 00:03:47.958\nI said, \"I\u2019ve given up riding and driving in cars.\"\n\n00:03:47.958 --> 00:03:50.958\nMy dad said, \"Why didn\u2019t you do that when you were 16?\"\n\n00:03:50.958 --> 00:03:52.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:03:52.958 --> 00:03:53.958\nI didn\u2019t know about the environment then.\n\n00:03:53.958 --> 00:03:55.958\nThey\u2019re back in Philadelphia.\n\n00:03:55.958 --> 00:03:59.958\nAnd so I told my mother, \"I\u2019m happy though, I\u2019m really happy.\"\n\n00:03:59.958 --> 00:04:02.958\nShe said, \"If you were happy, son, you wouldn\u2019t have to say it.\"\n\n00:04:02.958 --> 00:04:05.958\nMothers are like that.\n\n00:04:05.958 --> 00:04:13.958\nAnd so, on my 27th birthday I decided, because I argued so much\n\n00:04:13.958 --> 00:04:19.958\nand I talk so much, that I was going to stop speaking\n\n00:04:19.958 --> 00:04:23.958\nfor just one day -- one day -- to give it a rest.\n\n00:04:23.958 --> 00:04:26.958\nAnd so I did.\n\n00:04:26.958 --> 00:04:29.958\nI got up in the morning and I didn\u2019t say a word.\n\n00:04:29.958 --> 00:04:32.958\nAnd I have to tell you, it was a very moving experience,\n\n00:04:32.958 --> 00:04:39.958\nbecause for the first time, I began listening -- in a long time.\n\n00:04:39.958 --> 00:04:43.958\nAnd what I heard, it kind of disturbed me.\n\n00:04:43.958 --> 00:04:46.958\nBecause what I used to do, when I thought I was listening,\n\n00:04:46.958 --> 00:04:49.958\nwas I would listen just enough to hear what people had to say\n\n00:04:49.958 --> 00:04:54.958\nand think that I could -- I knew what they were going to say,\n\n00:04:54.958 --> 00:04:56.958\nand so I stopped listening.\n\n00:04:56.958 --> 00:04:59.958\nAnd in my mind, I just kind of raced ahead\n\n00:04:59.958 --> 00:05:01.958\nand thought of what I was going to say back,\n\n00:05:01.958 --> 00:05:03.958\nwhile they were still finishing up.\n\n00:05:03.958 --> 00:05:05.958\nAnd then I would launch in.\n\n00:05:05.958 --> 00:05:09.958\nWell, that just ended communication.\n\n00:05:09.958 --> 00:05:11.958\nSo on this first day I actually listened.\n\n00:05:11.958 --> 00:05:13.958\nAnd it was very sad for me,\n\n00:05:13.958 --> 00:05:19.958\nbecause I realized that for those many years I had not been learning.\n\n00:05:19.958 --> 00:05:21.958\nI was 27. I thought I knew everything.\n\n00:05:24.958 --> 00:05:26.958\nI didn\u2019t.\n\n00:05:26.958 --> 00:05:30.958\nAnd so I decided I\u2019d better do this for another day,\n\n00:05:30.958 --> 00:05:34.958\nand another day, and another day until finally,\n\n00:05:34.958 --> 00:05:37.958\nI promised myself for a year I would keep quiet\n\n00:05:37.958 --> 00:05:41.958\nbecause I started learning more and more and I needed to learn more.\n\n00:05:41.958 --> 00:05:43.958\nSo for a year I said I would keep quiet,\n\n00:05:43.958 --> 00:05:47.958\nand then on my birthday I would reassess what I had learned\n\n00:05:47.958 --> 00:05:49.958\nand maybe I would talk again.\n\n00:05:49.958 --> 00:05:52.958\nWell, that lasted 17 years.\n\n00:05:53.958 --> 00:05:59.958\nNow during that time -- those 17 years -- I walked and I played the banjo\n\n00:05:59.958 --> 00:06:04.958\nand I painted and I wrote in my journal, and\n\n00:06:04.958 --> 00:06:09.958\nI tried to study the environment by reading books.\n\n00:06:09.958 --> 00:06:13.958\nAnd I decided that I was going to go to school. So I did.\n\n00:06:13.958 --> 00:06:15.958\nI walked up to Ashland, Oregon,\n\n00:06:15.958 --> 00:06:20.958\nwhere they were offering an environmental studies degree.\n\n00:06:20.958 --> 00:06:22.958\nIt\u2019s only 500 miles.\n\n00:06:22.958 --> 00:06:26.958\nAnd I went into the Registrar\u2019s office and --\n\n00:06:31.958 --> 00:06:33.958\n\"What, what, what?\"\n\n00:06:33.958 --> 00:06:36.958\nI had a newspaper clipping.\n\n00:06:36.958 --> 00:06:38.958\n\"Oh, so you really want to go to school here?\n\n00:06:38.958 --> 00:06:40.958\nYou don\u2019t \u2026?\n\n00:06:40.958 --> 00:06:43.958\nWe have a special program for you.\" They did.\n\n00:06:43.958 --> 00:06:48.958\nAnd in those two years, I graduated with my first degree -- a bachelor\u2019s degree.\n\n00:06:48.958 --> 00:06:51.958\nAnd my father came out, he was so proud.\n\n00:06:51.958 --> 00:06:54.958\nHe said, \"Listen, we\u2019re really proud of you son,\n\n00:06:54.958 --> 00:06:56.958\nbut what are you going to do with a bachelor\u2019s degree?\n\n00:06:56.958 --> 00:06:58.958\nYou don\u2019t ride in cars, you don\u2019t talk --\n\n00:06:58.958 --> 00:07:00.958\nyou\u2019re going to have to do those things.\"\n\n00:07:00.958 --> 00:07:02.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:07:02.958 --> 00:07:04.958\nI hunched my shoulder, I picked my backpack up again\n\n00:07:04.958 --> 00:07:06.958\nand I started walking.\n\n00:07:08.958 --> 00:07:13.958\nI walked all the way up to Port Townsend, Washington, where I built a wooden boat,\n\n00:07:13.958 --> 00:07:16.958\nrode it across Puget Sound\n\n00:07:16.958 --> 00:07:21.958\nand walked across Washington [to] Idaho and down to Missoula, Montana.\n\n00:07:21.958 --> 00:07:25.958\nI had written the University of Montana two years earlier\n\n00:07:25.958 --> 00:07:28.958\nand said I'd like to go to school there.\n\n00:07:28.958 --> 00:07:31.958\nI said I'd be there in about two years.\n\n00:07:31.958 --> 00:07:33.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:07:33.958 --> 00:07:36.958\nAnd I was there. I showed up in two years and they --\n\n00:07:36.958 --> 00:07:38.958\nI tell this story because they really helped me.\n\n00:07:38.958 --> 00:07:40.958\nThere are two stories in Montana.\n\n00:07:42.958 --> 00:07:45.958\nThe first story is I didn\u2019t have any money -- that\u2019s a sign I used a lot.\n\n00:07:45.958 --> 00:07:48.958\nAnd they said,\"Don't worry about that.\"\n\n00:07:48.958 --> 00:07:51.958\nThe director of the program said, \"Come back tomorrow.\"\n\n00:07:51.958 --> 00:07:53.958\nHe gave me 150 dollars,\n\n00:07:53.958 --> 00:07:56.958\nand he said, \"Register for one credit.\n\n00:07:56.958 --> 00:07:58.958\nYou\u2019re going to go to South America, aren\u2019t you?\"\n\n00:07:58.958 --> 00:08:00.958\nAnd I said --\n\n00:08:00.958 --> 00:08:04.958\nRivers and lakes, the hydrological systems, South America.\n\n00:08:04.958 --> 00:08:07.958\nSo I did that.\n\n00:08:07.958 --> 00:08:09.958\nHe came back; he said to me,\n\n00:08:09.958 --> 00:08:13.958\n\"OK John, now that you've registered for that one credit,\n\n00:08:13.958 --> 00:08:16.958\nyou can have a key to an office, you can matriculate --\n\n00:08:16.958 --> 00:08:18.958\nyou\u2019re matriculating, so you can use the library.\n\n00:08:18.958 --> 00:08:19.958\nAnd what we\u2019re going to do\n\n00:08:19.958 --> 00:08:25.958\nis, we\u2019re going to have all of the professors allow you to go to class.\n\n00:08:25.958 --> 00:08:27.958\nThey\u2019re going to save your grade,\n\n00:08:27.958 --> 00:08:29.958\nand when we figure out how to get you the rest of the money,\n\n00:08:29.958 --> 00:08:36.958\nthen you can register for that class and they\u2019ll give you the grade.\"\n\n00:08:36.958 --> 00:08:39.958\nWow, they don\u2019t do that in graduate schools, I don\u2019t think.\n\n00:08:39.958 --> 00:08:43.958\nBut I use that story because they really wanted to help me.\n\n00:08:43.958 --> 00:08:46.958\nThey saw that I was really interested in the environment,\n\n00:08:46.958 --> 00:08:48.958\nand they really wanted to help me along the way.\n\n00:08:48.958 --> 00:08:53.958\nAnd during that time, I actually taught classes without speaking.\n\n00:08:53.958 --> 00:08:56.958\nI had 13 students when I first walked into the class.\n\n00:08:56.958 --> 00:09:02.958\nI explained, with a friend who could interpret my sign language,\n\n00:09:02.958 --> 00:09:04.958\nthat I was John Francis, I was walking around the world,\n\n00:09:04.958 --> 00:09:05.958\nI didn\u2019t talk and this was the last time\n\n00:09:05.958 --> 00:09:08.958\nthis person\u2019s going to be here interpreting for me.\n\n00:09:08.958 --> 00:09:11.958\nAll the students sat around and they went ...\n\n00:09:11.958 --> 00:09:16.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:09:16.958 --> 00:09:18.958\nI could see they were looking for the schedule,\n\n00:09:18.958 --> 00:09:20.958\nto see when they could get out.\n\n00:09:20.958 --> 00:09:24.958\nThey had to take that class with me.\n\n00:09:24.958 --> 00:09:27.958\nTwo weeks later, everyone was trying to get into our class.\n\n00:09:27.958 --> 00:09:31.958\nAnd I learned in that class -- because I would do things like this ...\n\n00:09:31.958 --> 00:09:33.958\nand they were all gathered around, going, \"What's he trying to say?\"\n\n00:09:33.958 --> 00:09:38.958\n\"I don't know, I think he's talking about clear cutting.\" \"Yeah, clear cutting.\"\n\n00:09:38.958 --> 00:09:41.958\n\"No, no, no, that's not clear cutting, that\u2019s -- he's using a handsaw.\"\n\n00:09:42.958 --> 00:09:45.958\n\"Well, you can\u2019t clearcut with a ...\"\n\n00:09:45.958 --> 00:09:47.958\n\"Yes, you can clear cut ...\"\n\n00:09:47.958 --> 00:09:49.958\n\"No, I think he\u2019s talking about selective forestry.\"\n\n00:09:49.958 --> 00:09:53.958\nNow this was a discussion class and we were having a discussion.\n\n00:09:53.958 --> 00:09:56.958\nI just backed out of that, you know, and I just kind of kept the fists from flying.\n\n00:09:56.958 --> 00:10:00.958\nBut what I learned was that sometimes I would make a sign\n\n00:10:00.958 --> 00:10:04.958\nand they said things that I absolutely did not mean,\n\n00:10:04.958 --> 00:10:06.958\nbut I should have.\n\n00:10:06.958 --> 00:10:11.958\nAnd so what came to me is, if you were a teacher\n\n00:10:11.958 --> 00:10:14.958\nand you were teaching, if you weren\u2019t learning\n\n00:10:14.958 --> 00:10:16.958\nyou probably weren\u2019t teaching very well.\n\n00:10:16.958 --> 00:10:18.958\nAnd so I went on.\n\n00:10:18.958 --> 00:10:20.958\nMy dad came out to see me graduate\n\n00:10:20.958 --> 00:10:22.958\nand, you know, I did the deal,\n\n00:10:22.958 --> 00:10:24.958\nand my father said, \"We\u2019re really proud of you son, but ... \"\n\n00:10:24.958 --> 00:10:26.958\nYou know what went on,\n\n00:10:26.958 --> 00:10:29.958\nhe said, \"You\u2019ve got to start riding and driving and start talking.\n\n00:10:29.958 --> 00:10:31.958\nWhat are you going to do with a master\u2019s degree?\"\n\n00:10:31.958 --> 00:10:33.958\nI hunched my shoulder, I got my backpack\n\n00:10:33.958 --> 00:10:35.958\nand I went on to the University of Wisconsin.\n\n00:10:36.958 --> 00:10:41.958\nI spent two years there writing on oil spills.\n\n00:10:41.958 --> 00:10:43.958\nNo one was interested in oil spills.\n\n00:10:43.958 --> 00:10:45.958\nBut something happened --\n\n00:10:46.958 --> 00:10:48.958\nExxon Valdez.\n\n00:10:49.958 --> 00:10:53.958\nAnd I was the only one in the United States writing on oil spills.\n\n00:10:53.958 --> 00:10:55.958\nMy dad came out again.\n\n00:10:55.958 --> 00:10:57.958\nHe said, \"I don't know how you do this, son --\n\n00:10:57.958 --> 00:11:00.958\nI mean, you don't ride in cars, you don\u2019t talk.\n\n00:11:00.958 --> 00:11:02.958\nMy sister said maybe I should leave you alone,\n\n00:11:02.958 --> 00:11:04.958\nbecause you seem to be doing a lot better\n\n00:11:04.958 --> 00:11:06.958\nwhen you\u2019re not saying anything.\"\n\n00:11:06.958 --> 00:11:09.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:11:09.958 --> 00:11:11.958\nWell, I put on my backpack again.\n\n00:11:11.958 --> 00:11:13.958\nI put my banjo on and I walked all the way to the East Coast,\n\n00:11:13.958 --> 00:11:15.958\nput my foot in the Atlantic Ocean --\n\n00:11:15.958 --> 00:11:19.958\nit was seven years and one day it took me to walk across the United States.\n\n00:11:21.958 --> 00:11:26.958\nAnd on Earth Day, 1990 --\n\n00:11:26.958 --> 00:11:29.958\nthe 20th anniversary of Earth Day -- that\u2019s when I began to speak.\n\n00:11:29.958 --> 00:11:31.958\nAnd that\u2019s why I said, \"Thank you for being here.\"\n\n00:11:31.958 --> 00:11:35.958\nBecause it's sort of like that tree in the forest falling;\n\n00:11:35.958 --> 00:11:38.958\nand if there's no one there to hear, does it really make a sound?\n\n00:11:38.958 --> 00:11:41.958\nAnd I\u2019m thanking you, and I'm thanking my family\n\n00:11:41.958 --> 00:11:43.958\nbecause they had come to hear me speak.\n\n00:11:43.958 --> 00:11:46.958\nAnd that\u2019s communication.\n\n00:11:46.958 --> 00:11:52.958\nAnd they also taught me about listening -- that they listened to me.\n\n00:11:52.958 --> 00:11:56.958\nAnd it\u2019s one of those things that came out of the silence,\n\n00:11:56.958 --> 00:11:58.958\nthe listening to each other.\n\n00:11:58.958 --> 00:12:00.958\nReally, very important --\n\n00:12:00.958 --> 00:12:03.958\nwe need to listen to each other.\n\n00:12:03.958 --> 00:12:05.958\nWell, my journey kept going on.\n\n00:12:05.958 --> 00:12:08.958\nMy dad said, \"That\u2019s one,\"\n\n00:12:08.958 --> 00:12:11.958\nand I still didn\u2019t let that go.\n\n00:12:11.958 --> 00:12:14.958\nI worked for the Coastguard, was made a U.N. Goodwill Ambassador.\n\n00:12:14.958 --> 00:12:17.958\nI wrote regulations for the United States --\n\n00:12:17.958 --> 00:12:19.958\nI mean, I wrote oil spill regulations.\n\n00:12:19.958 --> 00:12:23.958\n20 years ago, if someone had said to me,\n\n00:12:23.958 --> 00:12:26.958\n\"John, do you really want to make a difference?\"\n\n00:12:26.958 --> 00:12:27.958\n\"Yeah, I want to make a difference.\"\n\n00:12:27.958 --> 00:12:29.958\nHe said, \"You just start walking east;\n\n00:12:29.958 --> 00:12:32.958\nget out of your car and just start walking east.\"\n\n00:12:32.958 --> 00:12:36.958\nAnd as I walked off a little bit, they'd say, \"Yeah, and shut up, too.\"\n\n00:12:36.958 --> 00:12:39.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:12:39.958 --> 00:12:41.958\n\"You\u2019re going to make a difference, buddy.\"\n\n00:12:41.958 --> 00:12:44.958\nHow could that be, how could that be?\n\n00:12:44.958 --> 00:12:48.958\nHow could doing such a simple thing like walking and not talking\n\n00:12:48.958 --> 00:12:50.958\nmake a difference?\n\n00:12:50.958 --> 00:12:54.958\nWell, my time at the Coast Guard was a really good time.\n\n00:12:54.958 --> 00:12:57.958\nAnd after that -- I only worked one year --\n\n00:12:57.958 --> 00:13:01.958\nI said, \"That's enough. One year's enough for me to do that.\"\n\n00:13:01.958 --> 00:13:04.958\nI got on a sailboat and I sailed down to the Caribbean,\n\n00:13:04.958 --> 00:13:11.958\nand walked through all of the islands, and to Venezuela.\n\n00:13:11.958 --> 00:13:15.958\nAnd you know, I forgot the most important thing,\n\n00:13:15.958 --> 00:13:20.958\nwhich is why I started talking, which I have to tell you.\n\n00:13:20.958 --> 00:13:25.958\nI started talking because I had studied environment.\n\n00:13:25.958 --> 00:13:29.958\nI\u2019d studied environment at this formal level,\n\n00:13:29.958 --> 00:13:31.958\nbut there was this informal level.\n\n00:13:31.958 --> 00:13:34.958\nAnd the informal level --\n\n00:13:34.958 --> 00:13:40.958\nI learned about people, and what we do and how we are.\n\n00:13:40.958 --> 00:13:43.958\nAnd environment changed from just being about trees and birds\n\n00:13:43.958 --> 00:13:49.958\nand endangered species to being about how we treated each other.\n\n00:13:49.958 --> 00:13:51.958\nBecause if we are the environment,\n\n00:13:51.958 --> 00:13:53.958\nthen all we need to do is look around us\n\n00:13:53.958 --> 00:13:58.958\nand see how we treat ourselves and how we treat each other.\n\n00:13:58.958 --> 00:14:02.958\nAnd so that\u2019s the message that I had.\n\n00:14:02.958 --> 00:14:04.958\nAnd I said, \"Well, I'm going to have to spread that message.\"\n\n00:14:04.958 --> 00:14:08.958\nAnd I got in my sailboat, sailed all the way through the Caribbean --\n\n00:14:08.958 --> 00:14:12.958\nit wasn't really my sailboat, I kind of worked on that boat --\n\n00:14:12.958 --> 00:14:16.958\ngot to Venezuela and I started walking.\n\n00:14:16.958 --> 00:14:19.958\nThis is the last part of this story, because it\u2019s how I got here,\n\n00:14:19.958 --> 00:14:22.958\nbecause I still didn't ride in motorized vehicles.\n\n00:14:22.958 --> 00:14:29.958\nI was walking through El Dorado -- it's a prison town, famous prison,\n\n00:14:29.958 --> 00:14:34.958\nor infamous prison -- in Venezuela, and I don\u2019t know what possessed me,\n\n00:14:34.958 --> 00:14:36.958\nbecause this was not like me.\n\n00:14:36.958 --> 00:14:43.958\nThere I am, walking past the guard gate and the guard stops and says,\n\n00:14:43.958 --> 00:14:48.958\n\"Pasaporte, pasaporte,\" and with an M16 pointed at me.\n\n00:14:48.958 --> 00:14:52.958\nAnd I looked at him and I said, \"Passport, huh?\n\n00:14:52.958 --> 00:14:55.958\nI don't need to show you my passport. It\u2019s in the back of my pack.\n\n00:14:55.958 --> 00:15:01.958\nI'm Dr. Francis; I'm a U.N. Ambassador and I'm walking around the world.\"\n\n00:15:01.958 --> 00:15:03.958\nAnd I started walking off.\n\n00:15:03.958 --> 00:15:05.958\nWhat possessed me to say this thing?\n\n00:15:08.958 --> 00:15:10.958\nThe road turned into the jungle.\n\n00:15:10.958 --> 00:15:12.958\nI didn\u2019t get shot.\n\n00:15:12.958 --> 00:15:16.958\nAnd I got to -- I start saying, \"Free at last --\n\n00:15:16.958 --> 00:15:19.958\nthank God Almighty, I\u2019m free at last.\"\n\n00:15:23.958 --> 00:15:26.958\n\"What was that about,\" I\u2019m saying. What was that about?\n\n00:15:26.958 --> 00:15:34.958\nIt took me 100 miles to figure out that, in my heart, in me,\n\n00:15:34.958 --> 00:15:37.958\nI had become a prisoner.\n\n00:15:37.958 --> 00:15:41.958\nI was a prisoner and I needed to escape.\n\n00:15:41.958 --> 00:15:47.958\nThe prison that I was in was the fact that I did not drive\n\n00:15:47.958 --> 00:15:49.958\nor use motorized vehicles.\n\n00:15:49.958 --> 00:15:51.958\nNow how could that be?\n\n00:15:51.958 --> 00:15:55.958\nBecause when I started, it seemed very appropriate to me\n\n00:15:55.958 --> 00:15:57.958\nnot to use motorized vehicles.\n\n00:15:57.958 --> 00:15:59.958\nBut the thing that was different\n\n00:15:59.958 --> 00:16:02.958\nwas that every birthday, I asked myself about silence,\n\n00:16:02.958 --> 00:16:10.958\nbut I never asked myself about my decision to just use my feet.\n\n00:16:10.958 --> 00:16:13.958\nI had no idea I was going to become a U.N. Ambassador.\n\n00:16:13.958 --> 00:16:17.958\nI had no idea I would have a Ph.D.\n\n00:16:17.958 --> 00:16:23.958\nAnd so I realized that I had a responsibility to more than just me,\n\n00:16:23.958 --> 00:16:25.958\nand that I was going to have to change.\n\n00:16:25.958 --> 00:16:28.958\nYou know, we can do it.\n\n00:16:28.958 --> 00:16:30.958\nI was going to have to change.\n\n00:16:30.958 --> 00:16:32.958\nAnd I was afraid to change,\n\n00:16:32.958 --> 00:16:35.958\nbecause I was so used to the guy who only just walked.\n\n00:16:35.958 --> 00:16:41.958\nI was so used to that person that I didn\u2019t want to stop.\n\n00:16:41.958 --> 00:16:44.958\nI didn\u2019t know who I would be if I changed.\n\n00:16:44.958 --> 00:16:47.958\nBut I know I needed to.\n\n00:16:47.958 --> 00:16:51.958\nI know I needed to change, because it would be the only way\n\n00:16:51.958 --> 00:16:53.958\nthat I could be here today.\n\n00:16:55.958 --> 00:16:58.958\nAnd I know that a lot of times\n\n00:16:58.958 --> 00:17:02.958\nwe find ourselves in this wonderful place where we\u2019ve gotten to,\n\n00:17:02.958 --> 00:17:05.958\nbut there\u2019s another place for us to go.\n\n00:17:05.958 --> 00:17:11.958\nAnd we kind of have to leave behind the security of who we\u2019ve become,\n\n00:17:11.958 --> 00:17:18.958\nand go to the place of who we are becoming.\n\n00:17:18.958 --> 00:17:27.958\nAnd so, I want to encourage you to go to that next place,\n\n00:17:27.958 --> 00:17:32.958\nto let yourself out of any prison that you might find yourself in,\n\n00:17:32.958 --> 00:17:40.958\nas comfortable as it may be, because we have to do something now.\n\n00:17:40.958 --> 00:17:43.958\nWe have to change now.\n\n00:17:46.958 --> 00:17:51.958\nAs our former Vice President said,\n\n00:17:51.958 --> 00:17:53.958\nwe have to become activists.\n\n00:17:55.958 --> 00:17:59.958\nSo if my voice can touch you,\n\n00:17:59.958 --> 00:18:03.958\nif my actions can touch you, if my being here can touch you,\n\n00:18:03.958 --> 00:18:05.958\nplease let it be.\n\n00:18:05.958 --> 00:18:10.958\nAnd I know that all of you have touched me\n\n00:18:10.958 --> 00:18:13.958\nwhile I\u2019ve been here.\n\n00:18:15.958 --> 00:18:18.958\nSo, let\u2019s go out into the world\n\n00:18:18.958 --> 00:18:21.958\nand take this caring, this love, this respect\n\n00:18:21.958 --> 00:18:26.958\nthat we\u2019ve shown each other right here at TED,\n\n00:18:26.958 --> 00:18:28.958\nand take this out into the world.\n\n00:18:28.958 --> 00:18:33.958\nBecause we are the environment,\n\n00:18:33.958 --> 00:18:36.958\nand how we treat each other\n\n00:18:36.958 --> 00:18:41.958\nis really how we\u2019re going to treat the environment.\n\n00:18:41.958 --> 00:18:45.958\nSo I want to thank you for being here\n\n00:18:45.958 --> 00:18:50.958\nand I want to end this in five seconds of silence.\n\n00:18:58.958 --> 00:19:00.958\nThank you.\n\n00:19:00.958 --> 00:19:18.958\n(Applause)"}, {"title": "Tales of creativity and play", "duration": "1678", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/tim_brown_on_creativity_and_play", "transcript": "This is a guy named Bob McKim. He was a creativity researcher in the '60s and '70s, and also led the Stanford Design Program. And in fact, my friend and IDEO founder, David Kelley, who\u2019s out there somewhere, studied under him at Stanford. And he liked to do an exercise with his students where he got them to take a piece of paper and draw the person who sat next to them, their neighbor, very quickly, just as quickly as they could.And in fact, we\u2019re going to do that exercise right now. You all have a piece of cardboard and a piece of paper. It\u2019s actually got a bunch of circles on it. I need you to turn that piece of paper over; you should find that it\u2019s blank on the other side. And there should be a pencil. And I want you to pick somebody that\u2019s seated next to you, and when I say, go, you\u2019ve got 30 seconds to draw your neighbor, OK? So, everybody ready? OK. Off you go. You\u2019ve got 30 seconds, you\u2019d better be fast. Come on: those masterpieces ... OK? Stop. All right, now.(Laughter)Yes, lot\u2019s of laughter. Yeah, exactly. Lots of laughter, quite a bit of embarrassment.(Laughter)Am I hearing a few \"sorry\u2019s\"? I think I\u2019m hearing a few sorry\u2019s. Yup, yup, I think I probably am. And that\u2019s exactly what happens every time, every time you do this with adults. McKim found this every time he did it with his students. He got exactly the same response: lots and lots of sorry\u2019s.(Laughter)And he would point this out as evidence that we fear the judgment of our peers, and that we\u2019re embarrassed about showing our ideas to people we think of as our peers, to those around us. And this fear is what causes us to be conservative in our thinking. So we might have a wild idea, but we\u2019re afraid to share it with anybody else.OK, so if you try the same exercise with kids, they have no embarrassment at all. They just quite happily show their masterpiece to whoever wants to look at it. But as they learn to become adults, they become much more sensitive to the opinions of others, and they lose that freedom and they do start to become embarrassed. And in studies of kids playing, it\u2019s been shown time after time that kids who feel secure, who are in a kind of trusted environment \u2014 they\u2019re the ones that feel most free to play.And if you\u2019re starting a design firm, let\u2019s say, then you probably also want to create a place where people have the same kind of security. Where they have the same kind of security to take risks. Maybe have the same kind of security to play.Before founding IDEO, David said that what he wanted to do was to form a company where all the employees are my best friends. Now, that wasn\u2019t just self-indulgence. He knew that friendship is a short cut to play. And he knew that it gives us a sense of trust, and it allows us then to take the kind of creative risks that we need to take as designers. And so, that decision to work with his friends \u2014 now he has 550 of them \u2014 was what got IDEO started.And our studios, like, I think, many creative workplaces today, are designed to help people feel relaxed: familiar with their surroundings, comfortable with the people that they\u2019re working with. It takes more than decor, but I think we\u2019ve all seen that creative companies do often have symbols in the workplace that remind people to be playful, and that it\u2019s a permissive environment. So, whether it\u2019s this microbus meeting room that we have in one our buildings at IDEO; or at Pixar, where the animators work in wooden huts and decorated caves; or at the Googleplex, where it\u2019s famous for its [beach] volleyball courts, and even this massive dinosaur skeleton with pink flamingos on it. Don\u2019t know the reason for the pink flamingos, but anyway, they\u2019re there in the garden. Or even in the Swiss office of Google, which perhaps has the most wacky ideas of all. And my theory is, that\u2019s so the Swiss can prove to their Californian colleagues that they\u2019re not boring. So they have the slide, and they even have a fireman\u2019s pole. Don\u2019t know what they do with that, but they have one.So all of these places have these symbols. Now, our big symbol at IDEO is actually not so much the place, it\u2019s a thing. And it\u2019s actually something that we invented a few years ago, or created a few years ago. It\u2019s a toy; it\u2019s called a \"finger blaster.\" And I forgot to bring one up with me. So if somebody can reach under the chair that\u2019s next to them, you\u2019ll find something taped underneath it. That\u2019s great. If you could pass it up. Thanks, David, I appreciate it.So this is a finger blaster, and you will find that every one of you has got one taped under your chair. And I\u2019m going to run a little experiment. Another little experiment. But before we start, I need just to put these on. Thank you. All right. Now, what I\u2019m going to do is, I\u2019m going to see how \u2014 I can\u2019t see out of these, OK. I\u2019m going to see how many of you at the back of the room can actually get those things onto the stage. So the way they work is, you know, you just put your finger in the thing, pull them back, and off you go. So, don\u2019t look backwards. That\u2019s my only recommendation here. I want to see how many of you can get these things on the stage. So come on! There we go, there we go. Thank you. Thank you. Oh. I have another idea. I wanted to \u2014 there we go.(Laughter)There we go.(Laughter)Thank you, thank you, thank you. Not bad, not bad. No serious injuries so far.(Laughter)Well, they\u2019re still coming in from the back there; they\u2019re still coming in. Some of you haven\u2019t fired them yet. Can you not figure out how to do it, or something? It\u2019s not that hard. Most of your kids figure out how to do this in the first 10 seconds, when they pick it up. All right. This is pretty good; this is pretty good. Okay, all right. Let\u2019s \u2014 I suppose we'd better... I'd better clear these up out of the way; otherwise, I\u2019m going to trip over them. All right. So the rest of you can save them for when I say something particularly boring, and then you can fire at me.(Laughter)All right. I think I\u2019m going to take these off now, because I can\u2019t see a damn thing when I\u2019ve \u2014 all right, OK. So, ah, that was fun.(Laughter)All right, good.(Applause)So, OK, so why? So we have the finger blasters. Other people have dinosaurs, you know. Why do we have them? Well, as I said, we have them because we think maybe playfulness is important. But why is it important? We use it in a pretty pragmatic way, to be honest. We think playfulness helps us get to better creative solutions. Helps us do our jobs better, and helps us feel better when we do them.Now, an adult encountering a new situation \u2014 when we encounter a new situation we have a tendency to want to categorize it just as quickly as we can, you know. And there\u2019s a reason for that: we want to settle on an answer. Life\u2019s complicated; we want to figure out what\u2019s going on around us very quickly. I suspect, actually, that the evolutionary biologists probably have lots of reasons [for] why we want to categorize new things very, very quickly. One of them might be, you know, when we see this funny stripy thing: is that a tiger just about to jump out and kill us? Or is it just some weird shadows on the tree? We need to figure that out pretty fast. Well, at least, we did once. Most of us don\u2019t need to anymore, I suppose.This is some aluminum foil, right? You use it in the kitchen. That\u2019s what it is, isn\u2019t it? Of course it is, of course it is. Well, not necessarily.(Laughter)Kids are more engaged with open possibilities. Now, they\u2019ll certainly \u2014 when they come across something new, they\u2019ll certainly ask, \"What is it?\" Of course they will. But they\u2019ll also ask, \"What can I do with it?\" And you know, the more creative of them might get to a really interesting example. And this openness is the beginning of exploratory play. Any parents of young kids in the audience? There must be some. Yeah, thought so. So we\u2019ve all seen it, haven\u2019t we?We\u2019ve all told stories about how, on Christmas morning, our kids end up playing with the boxes far more than they play with the toys that are inside them. And you know, from an exploration perspective, this behavior makes complete sense. Because you can do a lot more with boxes than you can do with a toy. Even one like, say, Tickle Me Elmo \u2014 which, despite its ingenuity, really only does one thing, whereas boxes offer an infinite number of choices. So again, this is another one of those playful activities that, as we get older, we tend to forget and we have to relearn.So another one of Bob McKim\u2019s favorite exercises is called the \"30 Circles Test.\" So we\u2019re back to work. You guys are going to get back to work again. Turn that piece of paper that you did the sketch on back over, and you\u2019ll find those 30 circles printed on the piece of paper. So it should look like this. You should be looking at something like this. So what I\u2019m going to do is, I\u2019m going to give you minute, and I want you to adapt as many of those circles as you can into objects of some form. So for example, you could turn one into a football, or another one into a sun. All I\u2019m interested in is quantity. I want you to do as many of them as you can, in the minute that I\u2019m just about to give you. So, everybody ready? OK? Off you go.Okay. Put down your pencils, as they say. So, who got more than five circles figured out? Hopefully everybody? More than 10? Keep your hands up if you did 10. 15? 20? Anybody get all 30? No? Oh! Somebody did. Fantastic. Did anybody to a variation on a theme? Like a smiley face? Happy face? Sad face? Sleepy face? Anybody do that? Anybody use my examples? The sun and the football? Great. Cool. So I was really interested in quantity. I wasn\u2019t actually very interested in whether they were all different. I just wanted you to fill in as many circles as possible. And one of the things we tend to do as adults, again, is we edit things. We stop ourselves from doing things. We self-edit as we\u2019re having ideas.And in some cases, our desire to be original is actually a form of editing. And that actually isn\u2019t necessarily really playful. So that ability just to go for it and explore lots of things, even if they don\u2019t seem that different from each other, is actually something that kids do well, and it is a form of play. So now, Bob McKim did another version of this test in a rather famous experiment that was done in the 1960s. Anybody know what this is? It\u2019s the peyote cactus. It\u2019s the plant from which you can create mescaline, one of the psychedelic drugs. For those of you around in the '60s, you probably know it well.McKim published a paper in 1966, describing an experiment that he and his colleagues conducted to test the effects of psychedelic drugs on creativity. So he picked 27 professionals \u2014 they were engineers, physicists, mathematicians, architects, furniture designers even, artists \u2014 and he asked them to come along one evening, and to bring a problem with them that they were working on. He gave each of them some mescaline, and had them listen to some nice, relaxing music for a while. And then he did what\u2019s called the Purdue Creativity Test. You might know it as, \"How many uses can you find for a paper clip?\" It\u2019s basically the same thing as the 30 circles thing that I just had you do.Now, actually, he gave the test before the drugs and after the drugs, to see what the difference was in people\u2019s facility and speed with coming up with ideas. And then he asked them to go away and work on those problems that they\u2019d brought. And they\u2019d come up with a bunch of interesting solutions \u2014 and actually, quite valid solutions \u2014 to the things that they\u2019d been working on. And so, some of the things that they figured out, some of these individuals figured out; in one case, a new commercial building and designs for houses that were accepted by clients; a design of a solar space probe experiment; a redesign of the linear electron accelerator; an engineering improvement to a magnetic tape recorder \u2014 you can tell this is a while ago; the completion of a line of furniture; and even a new conceptual model of the photon. So it was a pretty successful evening.In fact, maybe this experiment was the reason that Silicon Valley got off to its great start with innovation. We don\u2019t know, but it may be. We need to ask some of the CEOs whether they were involved in this mescaline experiment. But really, it wasn\u2019t the drugs that were important; it was this idea that what the drugs did would help shock people out of their normal way of thinking, and getting them to forget the adult behaviors that were getting in the way of their ideas. But it\u2019s hard to break our habits, our adult habits.At IDEO we have brainstorming rules written on the walls. Edicts like, \"Defer judgment,\" or \"Go for quantity.\" And somehow that seems wrong. I mean, can you have rules about creativity? Well, it sort of turns out that we need rules to help us break the old rules and norms that otherwise we might bring to the creative process. And we\u2019ve certainly learnt that over time, you get much better brainstorming, much more creative outcomes when everybody does play by the rules. Now, of course, many designers, many individual designers, achieve this is in a much more organic way.I think the Eameses are wonderful examples of experimentation. And they experimented with plywood for many years without necessarily having one single goal in mind. They were exploring following what was interesting to them. They went from designing splints for wounded soldiers coming out of World War II and the Korean War, I think, and from this experiment they moved on to chairs.Through constant experimentation with materials, they developed a wide range of iconic solutions that we know today, eventually resulting in, of course, the legendary lounge chair. Now, if the Eameses had stopped with that first great solution, then we wouldn\u2019t be the beneficiaries of so many wonderful designs today. And of course, they used experimentation in all aspects of their work, from films to buildings, from games to graphics. So, they\u2019re great examples, I think, of exploration and experimentation in design.Now, while the Eameses were exploring those possibilities, they were also exploring physical objects. And they were doing that through building prototypes. And building is the next of the behaviors that I thought I\u2019d talk about. So the average Western first-grader spends as much as 50 percent of their play time taking part in what\u2019s called \"construction play.\" Construction play \u2014 it\u2019s playful, obviously, but also a powerful way to learn. When play is about building a tower out of blocks, the kid begins to learn a lot about towers. And as they repeatedly knock it down and start again, learning is happening as a sort of by-product of play. It\u2019s classically learning by doing.Now, David Kelley calls this behavior, when it\u2019s carried out by designers, \"thinking with your hands.\" And it typically involves making multiple, low-resolution prototypes very quickly, often by bringing lots of found elements together in order to get to a solution. On one of his earliest projects, the team was kind of stuck, and they came up with a mechanism by hacking together a prototype made from a roll-on deodorant. Now, that became the first commercial computer mouse for the Apple Lisa and the Macintosh.So, they learned their way to that by building prototypes. Another example is a group of designers who were working on a surgical instrument with some surgeons. They were meeting with them; they were talking to the surgeons about what it was they needed with this device. And one of the designers ran out of the room and grabbed a white board marker and a film canister \u2014 which is now becoming a very precious prototyping medium \u2014 and a clothespin. He taped them all together, ran back into the room and said, \"You mean, something like this?\" And the surgeons grabbed hold of it and said, well, I want to hold it like this, or like that. And all of a sudden a productive conversation was happening about design around a tangible object. And in the end it turned into a real device.And so this behavior is all about quickly getting something into the real world, and having your thinking advanced as a result. At IDEO there\u2019s a kind of a back-to-preschool feel sometimes about the environment. The prototyping carts, filled with colored paper and Play-Doh and glue sticks and stuff \u2014 I mean, they do have a bit of a kindergarten feel to them. But the important idea is that everything\u2019s at hand, everything\u2019s around. So when designers are working on ideas, they can start building stuff whenever they want. They don\u2019t necessarily even have to go into some kind of formal workshop to do it. And we think that\u2019s pretty important.And then the sad thing is, although preschools are full of this kind of stuff, as kids go through the school system it all gets taken away. They lose this stuff that facilitates this sort of playful and building mode of thinking. And of course, by the time you get to the average workplace, maybe the best construction tool we have might be the Post-it notes. It\u2019s pretty barren. But by giving project teams and the clients who they\u2019re working with permission to think with their hands, quite complex ideas can spring into life and go right through to execution much more easily.This is a nurse using a very simple \u2014 as you can see \u2014 plasticine prototype, explaining what she wants out of a portable information system to a team of technologists and designers that are working with her in a hospital. And just having this very simple prototype allows her to talk about what she wants in a much more powerful way. And of course, by building quick prototypes, we can get out and test our ideas with consumers and users much more quickly than if we\u2019re trying to describe them through words.But what about designing something that isn\u2019t physical? Something like a service or an experience? Something that exists as a series of interactions over time? Instead of building play, this can be approached with role-play. So, if you\u2019re designing an interaction between two people \u2014 such as, I don\u2019t know \u2014 ordering food at a fast food joint or something, you need to be able to imagine how that experience might feel over a period of time. And I think the best way to achieve that, and get a feeling for any flaws in your design, is to act it out.So we do quite a lot of work at IDEO trying to convince our clients of this. They can be a little skeptical; I\u2019ll come back to that. But a place, I think, where the effort is really worthwhile is where people are wrestling with quite serious problems \u2014 things like education or security or finance or health. And this is another example in a healthcare environment of some doctors and some nurses and designers acting out a service scenario around patient care. But you know, many adults are pretty reluctant to engage with role-play. Some of it\u2019s embarrassment and some of it is because they just don\u2019t believe that what emerges is necessarily valid. They dismiss an interesting interaction by saying, you know, \"That\u2019s just happening because they\u2019re acting it out.\"Research into kids' behavior actually suggests that it\u2019s worth taking role-playing seriously. Because when children play a role, they actually follow social scripts quite closely that they\u2019ve learnt from us as adults. If one kid plays \"store,\" and another one\u2019s playing \"house,\" then the whole kind of play falls down. So they get used to quite quickly to understanding the rules for social interactions, and are actually quite quick to point out when they\u2019re broken.So when, as adults, we role-play, then we have a huge set of these scripts already internalized. We\u2019ve gone through lots of experiences in life, and they provide a strong intuition as to whether an interaction is going to work. So we\u2019re very good, when acting out a solution, at spotting whether something lacks authenticity. So role-play is actually, I think, quite valuable when it comes to thinking about experiences. Another way for us, as designers, to explore role-play is to put ourselves through an experience which we\u2019re designing for, and project ourselves into an experience.So here are some designers who are trying to understand what it might feel like to sleep in a confined space on an airplane. And so they grabbed some very simple materials, you can see, and did this role-play, this kind of very crude role-play, just to get a sense of what it would be like for passengers if they were stuck in quite small places on airplanes.This is one of our designers, Kristian Simsarian, and he\u2019s putting himself through the experience of being an ER patient. Now, this is a real hospital, in a real emergency room. One of the reasons he chose to take this rather large video camera with him was because he didn\u2019t want the doctors and nurses thinking he was actually sick, and sticking something into him that he was going to regret later. So anyhow, he went there with his video camera, and it\u2019s kind of interesting to see what he brought back. Because when we looked at the video when he got back, we saw 20 minutes of this.(Laughter)And also, the amazing thing about this video \u2014 as soon as you see it you immediately project yourself into that experience. And you know what it feels like: all of that uncertainty while you\u2019re left out in the hallway while the docs are dealing with some more urgent case in one of the emergency rooms, wondering what the heck\u2019s going on. And so this notion of using role-play \u2014 or in this case, living through the experience as a way of creating empathy \u2014 particularly when you use video, is really powerful.Or another one of our designers, Altay Sendil: he\u2019s here having his chest waxed, not because he\u2019s very vain, although actually he is \u2014 no, I\u2019m kidding \u2014 but in order to empathize with the pain that chronic care patients go through when they\u2019re having dressings removed. And so sometimes these analogous experiences, analogous role-play, can also be quite valuable.So when a kid dresses up as a firefighter, you know, he\u2019s beginning to try on that identity. He wants to know what it feels like to be a firefighter. We\u2019re doing the same thing as designers. We\u2019re trying on these experiences. And so the idea of role-play is both as an empathy tool, as well as a tool for prototyping experiences. And you know, we kind of admire people who do this at IDEO anyway. Not just because they lead to insights about the experience, but also because of their willingness to explore and their ability to unselfconsciously surrender themselves to the experience. In short, we admire their willingness to play.Playful exploration, playful building and role-play: those are some of the ways that designers use play in their work. And so far, I admit, this might feel like it\u2019s a message just to go out and play like a kid. And to certain extent it is, but I want to stress a couple of points. The first thing to remember is that play is not anarchy. Play has rules, especially when it\u2019s group play. When kids play tea party, or they play cops and robbers, they\u2019re following a script that they\u2019ve agreed to. And it\u2019s this code negotiation that leads to productive play.So, remember the sketching task we did at the beginning? The kind of little face, the portrait you did? Well, imagine if you did the same task with friends while you were drinking in a pub. But everybody agreed to play a game where the worst sketch artist bought the next round of drinks. That framework of rules would have turned an embarrassing, difficult situation into a fun game. As a result, we\u2019d all feel perfectly secure and have a good time \u2014 but because we all understood the rules and we agreed on them together.But there aren\u2019t just rules about how to play; there are rules about when to play. Kids don\u2019t play all the time, obviously. They transition in and out of it, and good teachers spend a lot of time thinking about how to move kids through these experiences. As designers, we need to be able to transition in and out of play also. And if we\u2019re running design studios we need to be able to figure out, how can we transition designers through these different experiences? I think this is particularly true if we think about the sort of \u2014I think what\u2019s very different about design is that we go through these two very distinctive modes of operation. We go through a sort of generative mode, where we\u2019re exploring many ideas; and then we come back together again, and come back looking for that solution, and developing that solution. I think they\u2019re two quite different modes: divergence and convergence. And I think it\u2019s probably in the divergent mode that we most need playfulness. Perhaps in convergent mode we need to be more serious. And so being able to move between those modes is really quite important. So, it\u2019s where there\u2019s a more nuanced version view of play, I think, is required.Because it\u2019s very easy to fall into the trap that these states are absolute. You\u2019re either playful or you\u2019re serious, and you can\u2019t be both. But that\u2019s not really true: you can be a serious professional adult and, at times, be playful. It\u2019s not an either/or; it\u2019s an \"and.\" You can be serious and play. So to sum it up, we need trust to play, and we need trust to be creative. So, there\u2019s a connection. And there are a series of behaviors that we\u2019ve learnt as kids, and that turn out to be quite useful to us as designers. They include exploration, which is about going for quantity; building, and thinking with your hands; and role-play, where acting it out helps us both to have more empathy for the situations in which we\u2019re designing, and to create services and experiences that are seamless and authentic.Thank you very much.

time,\n\n00:01:58.958 --> 00:02:00.958\nevery time you do this with adults.\n\n00:02:00.958 --> 00:02:03.958\nMcKim found this every time he did it with his students.\n\n00:02:03.958 --> 00:02:07.958\nHe got exactly the same response: lots and lots of sorry\u2019s.\n\n00:02:07.958 --> 00:02:08.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:02:08.958 --> 00:02:12.958\nAnd he would point this out as

thinking.\n\n00:02:30.958 --> 00:02:32.958\nSo we might have a wild idea,\n\n00:02:32.958 --> 00:02:35.958\nbut we\u2019re afraid to share it with anybody else.\n\n00:02:35.958 --> 00:02:38.958\nOK, so if you try the same exercise with kids,\n\n00:02:38.958 --> 00:02:41.958\nthey have no embarrassment at all.\n\n00:02:41.958 --> 00:02:43.958\nThey just quite happily show their masterpiece\n\n00:02:43.958 --> 00:02:48.958\nto whoever wants to look at it.\n\n00:02:48.958 --> 00:02:51.958\nBut as they learn to become adults,\n\n00:02:51.958 --> 00:02:54.958\nthey become much more sensitive to the opinions of others,\n\n00:02:54.958 --> 00:02:59.958\nand they lose that freedom and they do start to become embarrassed.\n\n00:02:59.958 --> 00:03:02.958\nAnd in studies of kids playing, it\u2019s been shown\n\n00:03:02.958 --> 00:03:06.958\ntime after time that kids who feel secure,\n\n00:03:06.958 --> 00:03:09.958\nwho are in a kind of trusted environment --\n\n00:03:09.958 --> 00:03:15.958\nthey\u2019re the ones that feel most free to play.\n\n00:03:15.958 --> 00:03:18.958\nAnd if you\u2019re starting a design firm, let\u2019s say,\n\n00:03:18.958 --> 00:03:22.958\nthen you probably also want to create\n\n00:03:22.958 --> 00:03:25.958\na place where people have the same kind of security.\n\n00:03:25.958 --> 00:03:28.958\nWhere they have the same kind of security to take risks.\n\n00:03:28.958 --> 00:03:32.958\nMaybe have the same kind of security to play.\n\n00:03:32.958 --> 00:03:37.958\nBefore founding IDEO, David said that what he wanted to do\n\n00:03:37.958 --> 00:03:43.958\nwas to form a company where all the employees are my best friends.\n\n00:03:43.958 --> 00:03:46.958\nNow, that wasn\u2019t just self-indulgence.\n\n00:03:46.958 --> 00:03:52.958\nHe knew that friendship is a short cut to play.\n\n00:03:52.958 --> 00:03:57.958\nAnd he knew that it gives us a sense of trust,\n\n00:03:57.958 --> 00:04:00.958\nand it allows us then to take the kind of creative risks\n\n00:04:00.958 --> 00:04:03.958\nthat we need to take as designers.\n\n00:04:03.958 --> 00:04:07.958\nAnd so, that decision to work with his friends --\n\n00:04:07.958 --> 00:04:14.958\nnow he has 550 of them -- was what got IDEO started.\n\n00:04:14.958 --> 00:04:18.958\nAnd our studios, like, I think, many creative workplaces today,\n\n00:04:18.958 --> 00:04:21.958\nare designed to help people feel relaxed:\n\n00:04:21.958 --> 00:04:24.958\nfamiliar with their surroundings,\n\n00:04:24.958 --> 00:04:28.958\ncomfortable with the people that they\u2019re working with.\n\n00:04:28.958 --> 00:04:31.958\nIt takes more than decor, but I think we\u2019ve all seen that\n\n00:04:31.958 --> 00:04:36.958\ncreative companies do often have symbols in the workplace\n\n00:04:36.958 --> 00:04:39.958\nthat remind people to be playful,\n\n00:04:39.958 --> 00:04:42.958\nand that it\u2019s a permissive environment.\n\n00:04:42.958 --> 00:04:44.958\nSo, whether it\u2019s this microbus meeting room\n\n00:04:44.958 --> 00:04:46.958\nthat we have in one our buildings at IDEO;\n\n00:04:46.958 --> 00:04:52.958\nor at Pixar, where the animators work in wooden huts and decorated caves;\n\n00:04:52.958 --> 00:04:54.958\nor at the Googleplex, where\n\n00:04:54.958 --> 00:04:55.958\nit\u2019s famous for its [beach] volleyball courts,\n\n00:04:55.958 --> 00:04:59.958\nand even this massive dinosaur skeleton with pink flamingos on it.\n\n00:04:59.958 --> 00:05:01.958\nDon\u2019t know the reason for the pink flamingos,\n\n00:05:01.958 --> 00:05:03.958\nbut anyway, they\u2019re there in the garden.\n\n00:05:03.958 --> 00:05:05.958\nOr even in the Swiss office of Google,\n\n00:05:05.958 --> 00:05:07.958\nwhich perhaps has the most wacky ideas of all.\n\n00:05:07.958 --> 00:05:09.958\nAnd my theory is, that\u2019s so the Swiss can prove\n\n00:05:09.958 --> 00:05:12.958\nto their Californian colleagues that they\u2019re not boring.\n\n00:05:12.958 --> 00:05:15.958\nSo they have the slide, and they even have a fireman\u2019s pole.\n\n00:05:15.958 --> 00:05:16.958\nDon\u2019t know what they do with that, but they have one.\n\n00:05:16.958 --> 00:05:19.958\nSo all of these places have these symbols.\n\n00:05:19.958 --> 00:05:22.958\nNow, our big symbol at IDEO is actually\n\n00:05:22.958 --> 00:05:24.958\nnot so much the place, it\u2019s a thing.\n\n00:05:24.958 --> 00:05:27.958\nAnd it\u2019s actually something that we invented a few years ago,\n\n00:05:27.958 --> 00:05:28.958\nor created a few years ago.\n\n00:05:28.958 --> 00:05:31.958\nIt\u2019s a toy; it\u2019s called a \"finger blaster.\"\n\n00:05:31.958 --> 00:05:33.958\nAnd I forgot to bring one up with me.\n\n00:05:33.958 --> 00:05:36.958\nSo if somebody can reach under the chair that\u2019s next to them,\n\n00:05:36.958 --> 00:05:38.958\nyou\u2019ll find something taped underneath it.\n\n00:05:38.958 --> 00:05:41.958\nThat\u2019s great. If you could pass it up. Thanks, David, I appreciate it.\n\n00:05:41.958 --> 00:05:45.958\nSo this is a finger blaster, and you will find that every one of you\n\n00:05:45.958 --> 00:05:48.958\nhas got one taped under your chair.\n\n00:05:48.958 --> 00:05:52.958\nAnd I\u2019m going to run a little experiment. Another little experiment.\n\n00:05:52.958 --> 00:05:55.958\nBut before we start, I need just to put these on.\n\n00:05:55.958 --> 00:05:57.958\nThank you. All right.\n\n00:05:57.958 --> 00:06:00.958\nNow, what I\u2019m going to do is, I\u2019m going to see how --\n\n00:06:00.958 --> 00:06:01.958\nI can\u2019t see out of these, OK.\n\n00:06:01.958 --> 00:06:03.958\nI\u2019m going to see how many of you at the back of the room\n\n00:06:03.958 --> 00:06:05.958\ncan actually get those things onto the stage.\n\n00:06:05.958 --> 00:06:07.958\nSo the way they work is, you know,\n\n00:06:07.958 --> 00:06:10.958\nyou just put your finger in the thing,\n\n00:06:10.958 --> 00:06:13.958\npull them back, and off you go.\n\n00:06:13.958 --> 00:06:18.958\nSo, don\u2019t look backwards. That\u2019s my only recommendation here.\n\n00:06:18.958 --> 00:06:20.958\nI want to see how many of you can get these things on the stage.\n\n00:06:20.958 --> 00:06:23.958\nSo come on! There we go, there we go. Thank you. Thank you. Oh.\n\n00:06:23.958 --> 00:06:26.958\nI have another idea. I wanted to -- there we go.\n\n00:06:26.958 --> 00:06:30.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:06:30.958 --> 00:06:31.958\nThere we go.\n\n00:06:31.958 --> 00:06:35.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:06:35.958 --> 00:06:36.958\nThank you, thank you, thank you.\n\n00:06:36.958 --> 00:06:40.958\nNot bad, not bad. No serious injuries so far.\n\n00:06:40.958 --> 00:06:44.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:06:44.958 --> 00:06:49.958\nWell, they\u2019re still coming in from the back there;\n\n00:06:49.958 --> 00:06:50.958\nthey\u2019re still coming in.\n\n00:06:50.958 --> 00:06:51.958\nSome of you haven\u2019t fired them yet.\n\n00:06:51.958 --> 00:06:53.958\nCan you not figure out how to do it, or something?\n\n00:06:53.958 --> 00:06:56.958\nIt\u2019s not that hard. Most of your kids figure out how to do this\n\n00:06:56.958 --> 00:06:59.958\nin the first 10 seconds, when they pick it up.\n\n00:06:59.958 --> 00:07:01.958\nAll right. This is pretty good; this is pretty good.\n\n00:07:01.958 --> 00:07:07.958\nOkay, all right. Let\u2019s -- I suppose we'd better...\n\n00:07:07.958 --> 00:07:08.958\nI'd better clear these up out of the way;\n\n00:07:08.958 --> 00:07:10.958\notherwise, I\u2019m going to trip over them.\n\n00:07:10.958 --> 00:07:13.958\nAll right. So the rest of you can save them\n\n00:07:13.958 --> 00:07:15.958\nfor when I say something particularly boring,\n\n00:07:15.958 --> 00:07:16.958\nand then you can fire at me.\n\n00:07:16.958 --> 00:07:18.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:07:18.958 --> 00:07:19.958\nAll right. I think I\u2019m going to take these off now,\n\n00:07:19.958 --> 00:07:23.958\nbecause I can\u2019t see a damn thing when I\u2019ve -- all right, OK.\n\n00:07:23.958 --> 00:07:27.958\nSo, ah, that was fun.\n\n00:07:27.958 --> 00:07:29.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:07:29.958 --> 00:07:31.958\nAll right, good.\n\n00:07:31.958 --> 00:07:33.958\n(Applause)\n\n00:07:33.958 --> 00:07:35.958\nSo, OK, so why?\n\n00:07:35.958 --> 00:07:38.958\nSo we have the finger blasters. Other people have dinosaurs, you know.\n\n00:07:38.958 --> 00:07:40.958\nWhy do we have them? Well, as I said,\n\n00:07:40.958 --> 00:07:44.958\nwe have them because we think maybe playfulness is important.\n\n00:07:44.958 --> 00:07:46.958\nBut why is it important?\n\n00:07:46.958 --> 00:07:49.958\nWe use it in a pretty pragmatic way, to be honest.\n\n00:07:49.958 --> 00:07:54.958\nWe think playfulness helps us get to better creative solutions.\n\n00:07:54.958 --> 00:07:55.958\nHelps us do our jobs better,\n\n00:07:56.958 --> 00:07:58.958\nand helps us feel better when we do them.\n\n00:07:58.958 --> 00:08:02.958\nNow, an adult encountering a new situation --\n\n00:08:02.958 --> 00:08:05.958\nwhen we encounter a new situation we have a tendency\n\n00:08:05.958 --> 00:08:08.958\nto want to categorize it just as quickly as we can, you know.\n\n00:08:08.958 --> 00:08:14.958\nAnd there\u2019s a reason for that: we want to settle on an answer.\n\n00:08:14.958 --> 00:08:17.958\nLife\u2019s complicated; we want to figure out\n\n00:08:17.958 --> 00:08:18.958\nwhat\u2019s going on around us very quickly.\n\n00:08:18.958 --> 00:08:20.958\nI suspect, actually, that the evolutionary biologists\n\n00:08:20.958 --> 00:08:22.958\nprobably have lots of reasons [for] why we want\n\n00:08:22.958 --> 00:08:25.958\nto categorize new things very, very quickly.\n\n00:08:25.958 --> 00:08:27.958\nOne of them might be, you know,\n\n00:08:27.958 --> 00:08:28.958\nwhen we see this funny stripy thing:\n\n00:08:28.958 --> 00:08:31.958\nis that a tiger just about to jump out and kill us?\n\n00:08:31.958 --> 00:08:32.958\nOr is it just some weird shadows on the tree?\n\n00:08:32.958 --> 00:08:34.958\nWe need to figure that out pretty fast.\n\n00:08:34.958 --> 00:08:35.958\nWell, at least, we did once.\n\n00:08:35.958 --> 00:08:37.958\nMost of us don\u2019t need to anymore, I suppose.\n\n00:08:37.958 --> 00:08:39.958\nThis is some aluminum foil, right? You use it in the kitchen.\n\n00:08:39.958 --> 00:08:42.958\nThat\u2019s what it is, isn\u2019t it? Of course it is, of course it is.\n\n00:08:42.958 --> 00:08:44.958\nWell, not necessarily.\n\n00:08:44.958 --> 00:08:46.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:08:46.958 --> 00:08:49.958\nKids are more engaged with open possibilities.\n\n00:08:49.958 --> 00:08:51.958\nNow, they\u2019ll certainly -- when they come across something new,\n\n00:08:51.958 --> 00:08:53.958\nthey\u2019ll certainly ask, \"What is it?\"\n\n00:08:53.958 --> 00:08:56.958\nOf course they will. But they\u2019ll also ask, \"What can I do with it?\"\n\n00:08:56.958 --> 00:08:58.958\nAnd you know, the more creative of them\n\n00:08:58.958 --> 00:09:01.958\nmight get to a really interesting example.\n\n00:09:01.958 --> 00:09:06.958\nAnd this openness is the beginning of exploratory play.\n\n00:09:06.958 --> 00:09:09.958\nAny parents of young kids in the audience? There must be some.\n\n00:09:09.958 --> 00:09:12.958\nYeah, thought so. So we\u2019ve all seen it, haven\u2019t we?\n\n00:09:12.958 --> 00:09:15.958\nWe\u2019ve all told stories about how, on Christmas morning,\n\n00:09:15.958 --> 00:09:17.958\nour kids end up playing with the boxes\n\n00:09:17.958 --> 00:09:20.958\nfar more than they play with the toys that are inside them.\n\n00:09:20.958 --> 00:09:24.958\nAnd you know, from an exploration perspective,\n\n00:09:24.958 --> 00:09:26.958\nthis behavior makes complete sense.\n\n00:09:26.958 --> 00:09:29.958\nBecause you can do a lot more with boxes than you can do with a toy.\n\n00:09:29.958 --> 00:09:32.958\nEven one like, say, Tickle Me Elmo --\n\n00:09:32.958 --> 00:09:35.958\nwhich, despite its ingenuity, really only does one thing,\n\n00:09:35.958 --> 00:09:42.958\nwhereas boxes offer an infinite number of choices.\n\n00:09:42.958 --> 00:09:44.958\nSo again, this is another one of those playful activities\n\n00:09:44.958 --> 00:09:48.958\nthat, as we get older, we tend to forget and we have to relearn.\n\n00:09:49.958 --> 00:09:52.958\nSo another one of Bob McKim\u2019s favorite exercises\n\n00:09:52.958 --> 00:09:53.958\nis called the \"30 Circles Test.\"\n\n00:09:53.958 --> 00:09:56.958\nSo we\u2019re back to work. You guys are going to get back to work again.\n\n00:09:56.958 --> 00:09:58.958\nTurn that piece of paper that you did the sketch on\n\n00:09:58.958 --> 00:10:02.958\nback over, and you\u2019ll find those 30 circles printed on the piece of paper.\n\n00:10:02.958 --> 00:10:04.958\nSo it should look like this. You should be looking at something like this.\n\n00:10:04.958 --> 00:10:07.958\nSo what I\u2019m going to do is, I\u2019m going to give you minute,\n\n00:10:07.958 --> 00:10:10.958\nand I want you to adapt as many of those circles as you can\n\n00:10:10.958 --> 00:10:12.958\ninto objects of some form.\n\n00:10:12.958 --> 00:10:14.958\nSo for example, you could turn one into a football,\n\n00:10:14.958 --> 00:10:17.958\nor another one into a sun. All I\u2019m interested in is quantity.\n\n00:10:17.958 --> 00:10:20.958\nI want you to do as many of them as you can,\n\n00:10:20.958 --> 00:10:23.958\nin the minute that I\u2019m just about to give you.\n\n00:10:23.958 --> 00:10:26.958\nSo, everybody ready? OK? Off you go.\n\n00:10:41.958 --> 00:10:45.958\nOkay. Put down your pencils, as they say.\n\n00:10:45.958 --> 00:10:48.958\nSo, who got more than five circles figured out?\n\n00:10:48.958 --> 00:10:50.958\nHopefully everybody? More than 10?\n\n00:10:50.958 --> 00:10:52.958\nKeep your hands up if you did 10.\n\n00:10:52.958 --> 00:10:55.958\n15? 20? Anybody get all 30?\n\n00:10:55.958 --> 00:10:58.958\nNo? Oh! Somebody did. Fantastic.\n\n00:10:58.958 --> 00:11:03.958\nDid anybody to a variation on a theme? Like a smiley face?\n\n00:11:03.958 --> 00:11:08.958\nHappy face? Sad face? Sleepy face? Anybody do that?\n\n00:11:08.958 --> 00:11:12.958\nAnybody use my examples? The sun and the football?\n\n00:11:12.958 --> 00:11:16.958\nGreat. Cool. So I was really interested in quantity.\n\n00:11:16.958 --> 00:11:19.958\nI wasn\u2019t actually very interested in whether they were all different.\n\n00:11:19.958 --> 00:11:22.958\nI just wanted you to fill in as many circles as possible.\n\n00:11:22.958 --> 00:11:27.958\nAnd one of the things we tend to do as adults, again, is we edit things.\n\n00:11:27.958 --> 00:11:28.958\nWe stop ourselves from doing things.\n\n00:11:28.958 --> 00:11:30.958\nWe self-edit as we\u2019re having ideas.\n\n00:11:30.958 --> 00:11:36.958\nAnd in some cases, our desire to be original is actually a form of editing.\n\n00:11:36.958 --> 00:11:40.958\nAnd that actually isn\u2019t necessarily really playful.\n\n00:11:40.958 --> 00:11:45.958\nSo that ability just to go for it and explore lots of things,\n\n00:11:45.958 --> 00:11:47.958\neven if they don\u2019t seem that different from each other,\n\n00:11:47.958 --> 00:11:53.958\nis actually something that kids do well, and it is a form of play.\n\n00:11:53.958 --> 00:11:55.958\nSo now, Bob McKim did another\n\n00:11:55.958 --> 00:11:56.958\nversion of this test\n\n00:11:56.958 --> 00:12:00.958\nin a rather famous experiment that was done in the 1960s.\n\n00:12:00.958 --> 00:12:05.958\nAnybody know what this is? It\u2019s the peyote cactus.\n\n00:12:05.958 --> 00:12:07.958\nIt\u2019s the plant from which you can create mescaline,\n\n00:12:07.958 --> 00:12:09.958\none of the psychedelic drugs.\n\n00:12:09.958 --> 00:12:10.958\nFor those of you around in the '60s, you probably know it well.\n\n00:12:10.958 --> 00:12:16.958\nMcKim published a paper in 1966, describing an experiment\n\n00:12:16.958 --> 00:12:17.958\nthat he and his colleagues conducted\n\n00:12:17.958 --> 00:12:21.958\nto test the effects of psychedelic drugs on creativity.\n\n00:12:21.958 --> 00:12:28.958\nSo he picked 27 professionals -- they were\n\n00:12:28.958 --> 00:12:30.958\nengineers, physicists, mathematicians, architects,\n\n00:12:30.958 --> 00:12:33.958\nfurniture designers even, artists --\n\n00:12:33.958 --> 00:12:36.958\nand he asked them to come along one evening,\n\n00:12:36.958 --> 00:12:43.958\nand to bring a problem with them that they were working on.\n\n00:12:43.958 --> 00:12:45.958\nHe gave each of them some mescaline,\n\n00:12:45.958 --> 00:12:49.958\nand had them listen to some nice, relaxing music for a while.\n\n00:12:49.958 --> 00:12:55.958\nAnd then he did what\u2019s called the Purdue Creativity Test.\n\n00:12:55.958 --> 00:12:58.958\nYou might know it as, \"How many uses can you find for a paper clip?\"\n\n00:12:58.958 --> 00:13:02.958\nIt\u2019s basically the same thing as the 30 circles thing that I just had you do.\n\n00:13:02.958 --> 00:13:04.958\nNow, actually, he gave the test before the drugs\n\n00:13:04.958 --> 00:13:08.958\nand after the drugs, to see\n\n00:13:08.958 --> 00:13:10.958\nwhat the difference was in people\u2019s\n\n00:13:10.958 --> 00:13:13.958\nfacility and speed with coming up with ideas.\n\n00:13:13.958 --> 00:13:14.958\nAnd then he asked them to go away\n\n00:13:14.958 --> 00:13:18.958\nand work on those problems that they\u2019d brought.\n\n00:13:18.958 --> 00:13:20.958\nAnd they\u2019d come up with a bunch of\n\n00:13:20.958 --> 00:13:22.958\ninteresting solutions -- and actually, quite\n\n00:13:22.958 --> 00:13:25.958\nvalid solutions -- to the things that they\u2019d been working on.\n\n00:13:25.958 --> 00:13:26.958\nAnd so, some of the things that they figured out,\n\n00:13:26.958 --> 00:13:28.958\nsome of these individuals figured out;\n\n00:13:28.958 --> 00:13:31.958\nin one case, a new commercial building and designs for houses\n\n00:13:31.958 --> 00:13:32.958\nthat were accepted by clients;\n\n00:13:32.958 --> 00:13:36.958\na design of a solar space probe experiment;\n\n00:13:36.958 --> 00:13:41.958\na redesign of the linear electron accelerator;\n\n00:13:41.958 --> 00:13:43.958\nan engineering improvement to a magnetic tape recorder --\n\n00:13:43.958 --> 00:13:44.958\nyou can tell this is a while ago;\n\n00:13:44.958 --> 00:13:48.958\nthe completion of a line of furniture;\n\n00:13:48.958 --> 00:13:51.958\nand even a new conceptual model of the photon.\n\n00:13:51.958 --> 00:13:53.958\nSo it was a pretty successful evening.\n\n00:13:53.958 --> 00:13:57.958\nIn fact, maybe this experiment was the reason that Silicon Valley\n\n00:13:57.958 --> 00:14:00.958\ngot off to its great start with innovation.\n\n00:14:00.958 --> 00:14:01.958\nWe don\u2019t know, but it may be.\n\n00:14:01.958 --> 00:14:02.958\nWe need to ask some of the CEOs\n\n00:14:02.958 --> 00:14:04.958\nwhether they were involved in this mescaline experiment.\n\n00:14:04.958 --> 00:14:08.958\nBut really, it wasn\u2019t the drugs that were important;\n\n00:14:08.958 --> 00:14:09.958\nit was this idea that what the drugs did\n\n00:14:09.958 --> 00:14:12.958\nwould help shock people out of their normal way of thinking,\n\n00:14:12.958 --> 00:14:16.958\nand getting them to forget the adult behaviors\n\n00:14:16.958 --> 00:14:19.958\nthat were getting in the way of their ideas.\n\n00:14:19.958 --> 00:14:23.958\nBut it\u2019s hard to break our habits, our adult habits.\n\n00:14:23.958 --> 00:14:27.958\nAt IDEO we have brainstorming rules written on the walls.\n\n00:14:27.958 --> 00:14:31.958\nEdicts like, \"Defer judgment,\" or \"Go for quantity.\"\n\n00:14:31.958 --> 00:14:32.958\nAnd somehow that seems wrong.\n\n00:14:32.958 --> 00:14:34.958\nI mean, can you have rules about creativity?\n\n00:14:34.958 --> 00:14:36.958\nWell, it sort of turns out that we need rules\n\n00:14:36.958 --> 00:14:39.958\nto help us break the old rules and norms\n\n00:14:39.958 --> 00:14:43.958\nthat otherwise we might bring to the creative process.\n\n00:14:43.958 --> 00:14:44.958\nAnd we\u2019ve certainly learnt that over time,\n\n00:14:44.958 --> 00:14:46.958\nyou get much better brainstorming,\n\n00:14:46.958 --> 00:14:52.958\nmuch more creative outcomes when everybody does play by the rules.\n\n00:14:52.958 --> 00:14:55.958\nNow, of course, many designers, many individual designers,\n\n00:14:55.958 --> 00:14:57.958\nachieve this is in a much more organic way.\n\n00:14:57.958 --> 00:15:02.958\nI think the Eameses are wonderful examples of experimentation.\n\n00:15:02.958 --> 00:15:05.958\nAnd they experimented with plywood for many years\n\n00:15:05.958 --> 00:15:08.958\nwithout necessarily having one single goal in mind.\n\n00:15:08.958 --> 00:15:12.958\nThey were exploring following what was interesting to them.\n\n00:15:12.958 --> 00:15:14.958\nThey went from designing splints for wounded soldiers\n\n00:15:14.958 --> 00:15:17.958\ncoming out of World War II and the Korean War, I think,\n\n00:15:17.958 --> 00:15:19.958\nand from this experiment they moved on to chairs.\n\n00:15:19.958 --> 00:15:21.958\nThrough constant experimentation with materials,\n\n00:15:21.958 --> 00:15:24.958\nthey developed a wide range of iconic solutions\n\n00:15:24.958 --> 00:15:26.958\nthat we know today, eventually resulting in,\n\n00:15:26.958 --> 00:15:28.958\nof course, the legendary lounge chair.\n\n00:15:28.958 --> 00:15:31.958\nNow, if the Eameses had stopped with that first great solution,\n\n00:15:31.958 --> 00:15:34.958\nthen we wouldn\u2019t be the beneficiaries of so many\n\n00:15:34.958 --> 00:15:37.958\nwonderful designs today.\n\n00:15:37.958 --> 00:15:41.958\nAnd of course, they used experimentation in all aspects of their work,\n\n00:15:41.958 --> 00:15:47.958\nfrom films to buildings, from games to graphics.\n\n00:15:47.958 --> 00:15:51.958\nSo, they\u2019re great examples, I think, of exploration\n\n00:15:51.958 --> 00:15:53.958\nand experimentation in design.\n\n00:15:53.958 --> 00:15:56.958\nNow, while the Eameses were exploring those possibilities,\n\n00:15:56.958 --> 00:15:59.958\nthey were also exploring physical objects.\n\n00:15:59.958 --> 00:16:02.958\nAnd they were doing that through building prototypes.\n\n00:16:02.958 --> 00:16:07.958\nAnd building is the next of the behaviors that I thought I\u2019d talk about.\n\n00:16:07.958 --> 00:16:09.958\nSo the average Western first-grader\n\n00:16:09.958 --> 00:16:12.958\nspends as much as 50 percent of their play time\n\n00:16:12.958 --> 00:16:15.958\ntaking part in what\u2019s called \"construction play.\"\n\n00:16:15.958 --> 00:16:18.958\nConstruction play -- it\u2019s playful, obviously,\n\n00:16:18.958 --> 00:16:20.958\nbut also a powerful way to learn.\n\n00:16:20.958 --> 00:16:25.958\nWhen play is about building a tower out of blocks,\n\n00:16:25.958 --> 00:16:27.958\nthe kid begins to learn a lot about towers.\n\n00:16:27.958 --> 00:16:29.958\nAnd as they repeatedly knock it down and start again,\n\n00:16:29.958 --> 00:16:33.958\nlearning is happening as a sort of by-product of play.\n\n00:16:33.958 --> 00:16:37.958\nIt\u2019s classically learning by doing.\n\n00:16:37.958 --> 00:16:38.958\nNow, David Kelley calls this behavior,\n\n00:16:38.958 --> 00:16:42.958\nwhen it\u2019s carried out by designers, \"thinking with your hands.\"\n\n00:16:42.958 --> 00:16:45.958\nAnd it typically involves making multiple,\n\n00:16:45.958 --> 00:16:48.958\nlow-resolution prototypes very quickly,\n\n00:16:48.958 --> 00:16:50.958\noften by bringing lots of found elements together\n\n00:16:50.958 --> 00:16:53.958\nin order to get to a solution.\n\n00:16:53.958 --> 00:16:57.958\nOn one of his earliest projects, the team was kind of stuck,\n\n00:16:57.958 --> 00:17:01.958\nand they came up with a mechanism by hacking together\n\n00:17:01.958 --> 00:17:04.958\na prototype made from a roll-on deodorant.\n\n00:17:04.958 --> 00:17:06.958\nNow, that became the first commercial computer mouse\n\n00:17:06.958 --> 00:17:08.958\nfor the Apple Lisa and the Macintosh.\n\n00:17:08.958 --> 00:17:14.958\nSo, they learned their way to that by building prototypes.\n\n00:17:14.958 --> 00:17:16.958\nAnother example is a group of designers\n\n00:17:16.958 --> 00:17:19.958\nwho were working on a surgical instrument with some surgeons.\n\n00:17:19.958 --> 00:17:21.958\nThey were meeting with them; they were talking to the surgeons\n\n00:17:21.958 --> 00:17:24.958\nabout what it was they needed with this device.\n\n00:17:24.958 --> 00:17:26.958\nAnd one of the designers ran out of the room\n\n00:17:26.958 --> 00:17:29.958\nand grabbed a white board marker and a film canister --\n\n00:17:29.958 --> 00:17:32.958\nwhich is now becoming a very precious prototyping medium --\n\n00:17:32.958 --> 00:17:34.958\nand a clothespin. He taped them all together,\n\n00:17:34.958 --> 00:17:36.958\nran back into the room and said, \"You mean, something like this?\"\n\n00:17:36.958 --> 00:17:38.958\nAnd the surgeons grabbed hold of it and said,\n\n00:17:38.958 --> 00:17:40.958\nwell, I want to hold it like this, or like that.\n\n00:17:40.958 --> 00:17:42.958\nAnd all of a sudden a productive conversation\n\n00:17:42.958 --> 00:17:47.958\nwas happening about design around a tangible object.\n\n00:17:47.958 --> 00:17:51.958\nAnd in the end it turned into a real device.\n\n00:17:51.958 --> 00:17:54.958\nAnd so this behavior is all about quickly getting something\n\n00:17:54.958 --> 00:17:59.958\ninto the real world, and having your thinking advanced as a result.\n\n00:17:59.958 --> 00:18:02.958\nAt IDEO there\u2019s a kind of a back-to-preschool feel\n\n00:18:02.958 --> 00:18:04.958\nsometimes about the environment.\n\n00:18:04.958 --> 00:18:07.958\nThe prototyping carts, filled with colored paper\n\n00:18:07.958 --> 00:18:10.958\nand Play-Doh and glue sticks and stuff --\n\n00:18:10.958 --> 00:18:13.958\nI mean, they do have a bit of a kindergarten feel to them.\n\n00:18:13.958 --> 00:18:17.958\nBut the important idea is that everything\u2019s at hand, everything\u2019s around.\n\n00:18:17.958 --> 00:18:19.958\nSo when designers are working on ideas,\n\n00:18:19.958 --> 00:18:22.958\nthey can start building stuff whenever they want.\n\n00:18:22.958 --> 00:18:23.958\nThey don\u2019t necessarily even have to go\n\n00:18:23.958 --> 00:18:25.958\ninto some kind of formal workshop to do it.\n\n00:18:25.958 --> 00:18:27.958\nAnd we think that\u2019s pretty important.\n\n00:18:27.958 --> 00:18:29.958\nAnd then the sad thing is, although preschools\n\n00:18:29.958 --> 00:18:33.958\nare full of this kind of stuff, as kids go through the school system\n\n00:18:33.958 --> 00:18:35.958\nit all gets taken away.\n\n00:18:35.958 --> 00:18:37.958\nThey lose this stuff that facilitates\n\n00:18:37.958 --> 00:18:42.958\nthis sort of playful and building mode of thinking.\n\n00:18:42.958 --> 00:18:44.958\nAnd of course, by the time you get to the average workplace,\n\n00:18:44.958 --> 00:18:47.958\nmaybe the best construction tool we have\n\n00:18:47.958 --> 00:18:50.958\nmight be the Post-it notes. It\u2019s pretty barren.\n\n00:18:50.958 --> 00:18:54.958\nBut by giving project teams and the clients\n\n00:18:54.958 --> 00:18:56.958\nwho they\u2019re working with permission to think with their hands,\n\n00:18:56.958 --> 00:19:01.958\nquite complex ideas can spring into life\n\n00:19:01.958 --> 00:19:05.958\nand go right through to execution much more easily.\n\n00:19:05.958 --> 00:19:09.958\nThis is a nurse using a very simple -- as you can see -- plasticine prototype,\n\n00:19:09.958 --> 00:19:12.958\nexplaining what she wants out of a portable information system\n\n00:19:12.958 --> 00:19:15.958\nto a team of technologists and designers\n\n00:19:15.958 --> 00:19:18.958\nthat are working with her in a hospital.\n\n00:19:18.958 --> 00:19:19.958\nAnd just having this very simple prototype\n\n00:19:19.958 --> 00:19:24.958\nallows her to talk about what she wants in a much more powerful way.\n\n00:19:24.958 --> 00:19:26.958\nAnd of course, by building quick prototypes,\n\n00:19:26.958 --> 00:19:29.958\nwe can get out and test our ideas with consumers\n\n00:19:29.958 --> 00:19:31.958\nand users much more quickly\n\n00:19:31.958 --> 00:19:37.958\nthan if we\u2019re trying to describe them through words.\n\n00:19:37.958 --> 00:19:40.958\nBut what about designing something that isn\u2019t physical?\n\n00:19:40.958 --> 00:19:42.958\nSomething like a service or an experience?\n\n00:19:42.958 --> 00:19:45.958\nSomething that exists as a series of interactions over time?\n\n00:19:45.958 --> 00:19:51.958\nInstead of building play, this can be approached with role-play.\n\n00:19:51.958 --> 00:19:53.958\nSo, if you\u2019re designing an interaction between two people --\n\n00:19:53.958 --> 00:19:56.958\nsuch as, I don\u2019t know -- ordering food at a fast food joint\n\n00:19:56.958 --> 00:19:58.958\nor something, you need to be able to imagine\n\n00:19:58.958 --> 00:20:01.958\nhow that experience might feel over a period of time.\n\n00:20:01.958 --> 00:20:03.958\nAnd I think the best way to achieve that,\n\n00:20:03.958 --> 00:20:08.958\nand get a feeling for any flaws in your design, is to act it out.\n\n00:20:08.958 --> 00:20:10.958\nSo we do quite a lot of work at IDEO\n\n00:20:10.958 --> 00:20:12.958\ntrying to convince our clients of this.\n\n00:20:12.958 --> 00:20:14.958\nThey can be a little skeptical; I\u2019ll come back to that.\n\n00:20:14.958 --> 00:20:18.958\nBut a place, I think, where the effort is really worthwhile\n\n00:20:18.958 --> 00:20:22.958\nis where people are wrestling with quite serious problems --\n\n00:20:22.958 --> 00:20:27.958\nthings like education or security or finance or health.\n\n00:20:27.958 --> 00:20:30.958\nAnd this is another example in a healthcare environment\n\n00:20:30.958 --> 00:20:32.958\nof some doctors and some nurses and designers\n\n00:20:32.958 --> 00:20:36.958\nacting out a service scenario around patient care.\n\n00:20:36.958 --> 00:20:37.958\nBut you know, many adults\n\n00:20:37.958 --> 00:20:40.958\nare pretty reluctant to engage with role-play.\n\n00:20:40.958 --> 00:20:42.958\nSome of it\u2019s embarrassment and some of it is because\n\n00:20:42.958 --> 00:20:46.958\nthey just don\u2019t believe that what emerges is necessarily valid.\n\n00:20:46.958 --> 00:20:48.958\nThey dismiss an interesting interaction by saying,\n\n00:20:48.958 --> 00:20:51.958\nyou know, \"That\u2019s just happening because they\u2019re acting it out.\"\n\n00:20:51.958 --> 00:20:53.958\nResearch into kids' behavior actually suggests\n\n00:20:53.958 --> 00:20:56.958\nthat it\u2019s worth taking role-playing seriously.\n\n00:20:56.958 --> 00:20:57.958\nBecause when children play a role,\n\n00:20:57.958 --> 00:21:00.958\nthey actually follow social scripts quite closely\n\n00:21:00.958 --> 00:21:02.958\nthat they\u2019ve learnt from us as adults.\n\n00:21:02.958 --> 00:21:05.958\nIf one kid plays \"store,\" and another one\u2019s playing \"house,\"\n\n00:21:05.958 --> 00:21:07.958\nthen the whole kind of play falls down.\n\n00:21:08.958 --> 00:21:11.958\nSo they get used to quite quickly\n\n00:21:11.958 --> 00:21:15.958\nto understanding the rules for social interactions,\n\n00:21:15.958 --> 00:21:18.958\nand are actually quite quick to point out when they\u2019re broken.\n\n00:21:18.958 --> 00:21:21.958\nSo when, as adults, we role-play,\n\n00:21:21.958 --> 00:21:26.958\nthen we have a huge set of these scripts already internalized.\n\n00:21:26.958 --> 00:21:28.958\nWe\u2019ve gone through lots of experiences in life,\n\n00:21:28.958 --> 00:21:31.958\nand they provide a strong intuition\n\n00:21:31.958 --> 00:21:34.958\nas to whether an interaction is going to work.\n\n00:21:34.958 --> 00:21:36.958\nSo we\u2019re very good, when acting out a solution,\n\n00:21:36.958 --> 00:21:41.958\nat spotting whether something lacks authenticity.\n\n00:21:41.958 --> 00:21:42.958\nSo role-play is actually, I think,\n\n00:21:42.958 --> 00:21:46.958\nquite valuable when it comes to thinking about experiences.\n\n00:21:46.958 --> 00:21:49.958\nAnother way for us, as designers, to explore role-play\n\n00:21:49.958 --> 00:21:53.958\nis to put ourselves through an experience which we\u2019re designing for,\n\n00:21:53.958 --> 00:21:56.958\nand project ourselves into an experience.\n\n00:21:56.958 --> 00:21:58.958\nSo here are some designers who are trying to understand\n\n00:21:58.958 --> 00:22:01.958\nwhat it might feel like to sleep in a\n\n00:22:01.958 --> 00:22:03.958\nconfined space on an airplane.\n\n00:22:03.958 --> 00:22:05.958\nAnd so they grabbed some very simple materials, you can see,\n\n00:22:05.958 --> 00:22:09.958\nand did this role-play, this kind of very crude role-play,\n\n00:22:09.958 --> 00:22:11.958\njust to get a sense of what it would be like for passengers\n\n00:22:11.958 --> 00:22:16.958\nif they were stuck in quite small places on airplanes.\n\n00:22:16.958 --> 00:22:18.958\nThis is one of our designers, Kristian Simsarian,\n\n00:22:18.958 --> 00:22:22.958\nand he\u2019s putting himself through the experience of being an ER patient.\n\n00:22:22.958 --> 00:22:24.958\nNow, this is a real hospital, in a real emergency room.\n\n00:22:24.958 --> 00:22:26.958\nOne of the reasons he chose to take\n\n00:22:26.958 --> 00:22:27.958\nthis rather large video camera with him was\n\n00:22:27.958 --> 00:22:29.958\nbecause he didn\u2019t want the doctors and nurses thinking\n\n00:22:29.958 --> 00:22:32.958\nhe was actually sick, and sticking something into him\n\n00:22:32.958 --> 00:22:34.958\nthat he was going to regret later.\n\n00:22:34.958 --> 00:22:37.958\nSo anyhow, he went there with his video camera,\n\n00:22:37.958 --> 00:22:41.958\nand it\u2019s kind of interesting to see what he brought back.\n\n00:22:41.958 --> 00:22:43.958\nBecause when we looked at the video when he got back,\n\n00:22:43.958 --> 00:22:45.958\nwe saw 20 minutes of this.\n\n00:22:45.958 --> 00:22:48.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:22:48.958 --> 00:22:51.958\nAnd also, the amazing thing about this video --\n\n00:22:51.958 --> 00:22:53.958\nas soon as you see it you immediately\n\n00:22:53.958 --> 00:22:56.958\nproject yourself into that experience.\n\n00:22:56.958 --> 00:22:58.958\nAnd you know what it feels like: all of that uncertainty\n\n00:22:58.958 --> 00:23:00.958\nwhile you\u2019re left out in the hallway\n\n00:23:00.958 --> 00:23:02.958\nwhile the docs are dealing with some more urgent case\n\n00:23:02.958 --> 00:23:06.958\nin one of the emergency rooms, wondering what the heck\u2019s going on.\n\n00:23:06.958 --> 00:23:08.958\nAnd so this notion of using role-play --\n\n00:23:08.958 --> 00:23:11.958\nor in this case, living through the experience\n\n00:23:11.958 --> 00:23:12.958\nas a way of creating empathy --\n\n00:23:12.958 --> 00:23:15.958\nparticularly when you use video, is really powerful.\n\n00:23:15.958 --> 00:23:17.958\nOr another one of our designers, Altay Sendil:\n\n00:23:17.958 --> 00:23:20.958\nhe\u2019s here having his chest waxed, not because he\u2019s very vain,\n\n00:23:20.958 --> 00:23:22.958\nalthough actually he is -- no, I\u2019m kidding --\n\n00:23:22.958 --> 00:23:26.958\nbut in order to empathize with the pain that chronic care patients\n\n00:23:26.958 --> 00:23:28.958\ngo through when they\u2019re having dressings removed.\n\n00:23:28.958 --> 00:23:31.958\nAnd so sometimes these analogous experiences,\n\n00:23:31.958 --> 00:23:34.958\nanalogous role-play, can also be quite valuable.\n\n00:23:34.958 --> 00:23:37.958\nSo when a kid dresses up as a firefighter, you know,\n\n00:23:37.958 --> 00:23:39.958\nhe\u2019s beginning to try on that identity.\n\n00:23:39.958 --> 00:23:42.958\nHe wants to know what it feels like to be a firefighter.\n\n00:23:42.958 --> 00:23:44.958\nWe\u2019re doing the same thing as designers.\n\n00:23:44.958 --> 00:23:46.958\nWe\u2019re trying on these experiences.\n\n00:23:46.958 --> 00:23:50.958\nAnd so the idea of role-play is both as an empathy tool,\n\n00:23:50.958 --> 00:23:54.958\nas well as a tool for prototyping experiences.\n\n00:23:54.958 --> 00:23:59.958\nAnd you know, we kind of admire people who do this at IDEO anyway.\n\n00:23:59.958 --> 00:24:02.958\nNot just because they lead to insights about the experience,\n\n00:24:02.958 --> 00:24:05.958\nbut also because of their willingness to explore\n\n00:24:05.958 --> 00:24:08.958\nand their ability to unselfconsciously\n\n00:24:08.958 --> 00:24:11.958\nsurrender themselves to the experience.\n\n00:24:11.958 --> 00:24:16.958\nIn short, we admire their willingness to play.\n\n00:24:16.958 --> 00:24:22.958\nPlayful exploration, playful building and role-play:\n\n00:24:22.958 --> 00:24:25.958\nthose are some of the ways that designers use play in their work.\n\n00:24:25.958 --> 00:24:29.958\nAnd so far, I admit, this might feel\n\n00:24:29.958 --> 00:24:32.958\nlike it\u2019s a message just to go out and play like a kid.\n\n00:24:32.958 --> 00:24:36.958\nAnd to certain extent it is, but I want to stress a couple of points.\n\n00:24:36.958 --> 00:24:39.958\nThe first thing to remember is that play is not anarchy.\n\n00:24:39.958 --> 00:24:44.958\nPlay has rules, especially when it\u2019s group play.\n\n00:24:44.958 --> 00:24:48.958\nWhen kids play tea party, or they play cops and robbers,\n\n00:24:48.958 --> 00:24:51.958\nthey\u2019re following a script that they\u2019ve agreed to.\n\n00:24:51.958 --> 00:24:55.958\nAnd it\u2019s this code negotiation that leads to productive play.\n\n00:24:56.958 --> 00:24:58.958\nSo, remember the sketching task we did at the beginning?\n\n00:24:58.958 --> 00:25:00.958\nThe kind of little face, the portrait you did?\n\n00:25:00.958 --> 00:25:04.958\nWell, imagine if you did the same task with friends\n\n00:25:04.958 --> 00:25:06.958\nwhile you were drinking in a pub.\n\n00:25:06.958 --> 00:25:09.958\nBut everybody agreed to play a game\n\n00:25:09.958 --> 00:25:13.958\nwhere the worst sketch artist bought the next round of drinks.\n\n00:25:13.958 --> 00:25:17.958\nThat framework of rules would have turned an embarrassing,\n\n00:25:17.958 --> 00:25:19.958\ndifficult situation into a fun game.\n\n00:25:19.958 --> 00:25:25.958\nAs a result, we\u2019d all feel perfectly secure and have a good time --\n\n00:25:25.958 --> 00:25:30.958\nbut because we all understood the rules and we agreed on them together.\n\n00:25:30.958 --> 00:25:34.958\nBut there aren\u2019t just rules about how to play;\n\n00:25:34.958 --> 00:25:37.958\nthere are rules about when to play.\n\n00:25:37.958 --> 00:25:39.958\nKids don\u2019t play all the time, obviously.\n\n00:25:39.958 --> 00:25:41.958\nThey transition in and out of it,\n\n00:25:41.958 --> 00:25:44.958\nand good teachers spend a lot of time\n\n00:25:44.958 --> 00:25:48.958\nthinking about how to move kids through these experiences.\n\n00:25:48.958 --> 00:25:53.958\nAs designers, we need to be able to transition in and out of play also.\n\n00:25:53.958 --> 00:25:55.958\nAnd if we\u2019re running design studios\n\n00:25:55.958 --> 00:25:57.958\nwe need to be able to figure out, how can we transition\n\n00:25:57.958 --> 00:26:00.958\ndesigners through these different experiences?\n\n00:26:00.958 --> 00:26:03.958\nI think this is particularly true if we think about the sort of --\n\n00:26:03.958 --> 00:26:06.958\nI think what\u2019s very different about design\n\n00:26:06.958 --> 00:26:10.958\nis that we go through these two very distinctive modes of operation.\n\n00:26:10.958 --> 00:26:15.958\nWe go through a sort of generative mode,\n\n00:26:15.958 --> 00:26:16.958\nwhere we\u2019re exploring many ideas;\n\n00:26:16.958 --> 00:26:18.958\nand then we come back together again,\n\n00:26:18.958 --> 00:26:21.958\nand come back looking for that solution,\n\n00:26:21.958 --> 00:26:22.958\nand developing that solution.\n\n00:26:22.958 --> 00:26:25.958\nI think they\u2019re two quite different modes:\n\n00:26:25.958 --> 00:26:28.958\ndivergence and convergence.\n\n00:26:28.958 --> 00:26:31.958\nAnd I think it\u2019s probably in the divergent mode\n\n00:26:31.958 --> 00:26:33.958\nthat we most need playfulness.\n\n00:26:33.958 --> 00:26:36.958\nPerhaps in convergent mode we need to be more serious.\n\n00:26:36.958 --> 00:26:38.958\nAnd so being able to move between those modes\n\n00:26:38.958 --> 00:26:42.958\nis really quite important. So, it\u2019s where there\u2019s a\n\n00:26:42.958 --> 00:26:45.958\nmore nuanced version view of play, I think, is required.\n\n00:26:45.958 --> 00:26:48.958\nBecause it\u2019s very easy to fall into the trap that these states are absolute.\n\n00:26:48.958 --> 00:26:52.958\nYou\u2019re either playful or you\u2019re serious, and you can\u2019t be both.\n\n00:26:52.958 --> 00:26:57.958\nBut that\u2019s not really true: you can be a serious professional adult\n\n00:26:57.958 --> 00:27:00.958\nand, at times, be playful.\n\n00:27:00.958 --> 00:27:02.958\nIt\u2019s not an either/or; it\u2019s an \"and.\"\n\n00:27:02.958 --> 00:27:06.958\nYou can be serious and play.\n\n00:27:06.958 --> 00:27:12.958\nSo to sum it up, we need trust to play,\n\n00:27:12.958 --> 00:27:16.958\nand we need trust to be creative. So, there\u2019s a connection.\n\n00:27:16.958 --> 00:27:19.958\nAnd there are a series of behaviors that we\u2019ve learnt as kids,\n\n00:27:19.958 --> 00:27:22.958\nand that turn out to be quite useful to us as designers.\n\n00:27:22.958 --> 00:27:27.958\nThey include exploration, which is about going for quantity;\n\n00:27:27.958 --> 00:27:30.958\nbuilding, and thinking with your hands;\n\n00:27:30.958 --> 00:27:34.958\nand role-play, where acting it out helps us both\n\n00:27:34.958 --> 00:27:37.958\nto have more empathy for the situations in which we\u2019re designing,\n\n00:27:37.958 --> 00:27:40.958\nand to create services and experiences\n\n00:27:40.958 --> 00:27:44.958\nthat are seamless and authentic.\n\n00:27:44.958 --> 00:27:45.958\nThank you very much.

It\u2019s a fragrance called Beyond Paradise, which you can find in any store in the nation. Except here it\u2019s been split up in parts by Est\u00e9e Lauder and by the perfumer who did it, Calice Becker, and I'm most grateful to them for this. And it\u2019s been split up in successive bits and a chord.So what you\u2019re smelling now is the top note. And then will come what they call the heart, the lush heart note. I will show it to you. The Eden top note is named after the Eden Project in the U.K.The lush heart note, Melaleuca bark note \u2014 which does not contain any Melaleuca bark, because it\u2019s totally forbidden.And after that, the complete fragrance. Now what you are smelling is a combination of \u2014 I asked how many molecules there were in there, and nobody would tell me. So I put it through a G.C., a Gas Chromatograph that I have in my office, and it\u2019s about 400. So what you\u2019re smelling is several hundred molecules floating through the air, hitting your nose.And do not get the impression that this is very subjective. You are all smelling pretty much the same thing, OK? Smell has this reputation of being somewhat different for each person. It\u2019s not really true. And perfumery shows you that can\u2019t be true, because if it were like that it wouldn\u2019t be an art, OK?Now, while the smell wafts over you, let me tell you the history of an idea. Everything that you\u2019re smelling in here is made up of atoms that come from what I call the Upper East Side of the periodic table \u2014 a nice, safe neighborhood. (Laughter) You really don\u2019t want to leave it if you want to have a career in perfumery. Some people have tried in the 1920s to add things from the bad parts, and it didn\u2019t really work.These are the five atoms from which just about everything that you\u2019re going to smell in real life, from coffee to fragrance, are made of. The top note that you smelled at the very beginning, the cut-grass green, what we call in perfumery \u2014 they\u2019re weird terms \u2014 and this would be called a green note, because it smells of something green, like cut grass.This is cis-3-hexene-1-ol. And I had to learn chemistry on the fly in the last three years. A very expensive high school chemistry education. This has six carbon atoms, so \"hexa,\" hexene-1-ol. It has one double bond, it has an alcohol on the end, so it\u2019s \"ol,\" and that\u2019s why they call it cis-3-hexene-1-ol. Once you figure this out, you can really impress people at parties.This smells of cut grass. Now, this is the skeleton of the molecule. If you dress it up with atoms, hydrogen atoms \u2014 that\u2019s what it looks like when you have it on your computer \u2014 but actually it\u2019s sort of more like this, in the sense that the atoms have a certain sphere that you cannot penetrate. They repel.OK, now. Why does this thing smell of cut grass, OK? Why doesn\u2019t it smell of potatoes or violets? Well, there are really two theories. But the first theory is: it must be the shape. And that\u2019s a perfectly reasonable theory in the sense that almost everything else in biology works by shape. Enzymes that chew things up, antibodies, it\u2019s all, you know, the fit between a protein and whatever it is grabbing, in this case a smell. And I will try and explain to you what\u2019s wrong with this notion.And the other theory is that we smell molecular vibrations. Now, this is a totally insane idea. And when I first came across it in the early '90s, I thought my predecessor, Malcolm Dyson and Bob Wright, had really taken leave of their senses, and I\u2019ll explain to you why this was the case. However, I came to realize gradually that they may be right \u2014 and I have to convince all my colleagues that this is so, but I\u2019m working on it.Here\u2019s how shape works in normal receptors. You have a molecule coming in, it gets into the protein, which is schematic here, and it causes this thing to switch, to turn, to move in some way by binding in certain parts. And the attraction, the forces, between the molecule and the protein cause the motion. This is a shape-based idea.Now, what\u2019s wrong with shape is summarized in this slide. The way \u2014I expect everybody to memorize these compounds. This is one page of work from a chemist\u2019s workbook, OK? Working for a fragrance company. He\u2019s making 45 molecules, and he\u2019s looking for a sandalwood, something that smells of sandalwood. Because there\u2019s a lot of money in sandalwoods. And of these 45 molecules, only 4629 actually smells of sandalwood. And he puts an exclamation mark, OK? This is an awful lot of work. This actually is roughly, in man-years of work, 200,000 dollars roughly, if you keep them on the low salaries with no benefits. So this is a profoundly inefficient process. And my definition of a theory is, it\u2019s not just something that you teach people; it\u2019s labor saving. A theory is something that enables you to do less work. I love the idea of doing less work. So let me explain to you why \u2014 a very simple fact that tells you why this shape theory really does not work very well.This is cis-3-hexene-1-ol. It smells of cut grass. This is cis-3-hexene-1-thiol, and this smells of rotten eggs, OK? Now, you will have noticed that vodka never smells of rotten eggs. If it does, you put the glass down, you go to a different bar. This is \u2014 in other words, we never get the O-H \u2014 we never mistake it for an S-H, OK? Like, at no concentration, even pure, you know, if you smelt pure ethanol, it doesn\u2019t smell of rotten eggs. Conversely, there is no concentration at which the sulfur compound will smell like vodka. It\u2019s very hard to explain this by molecular recognition. Now, I showed this to a physicist friend of mine who has a profound distaste for biology, and he says, \"That\u2019s easy! The things are a different color!\" (Laughter)We have to go a little beyond that. Now let me explain why vibrational theory has some sort of interest in it. These molecules, as you saw in the beginning, the building blocks had springs connecting them to each other. In fact, molecules are able to vibrate at a set of frequencies which are very specific for each molecule and for the bonds connecting them.So this is the sound of the O-H stretch, translated into the audible range. S-H, quite a different frequency. Now, this is kind of interesting, because it tells you that you should be looking for a particular fact, which is this: nothing in the world smells like rotten eggs except S-H, OK?Now, Fact B: nothing in the world has that frequency except S-H. If you look on this, imagine a piano keyboard. The S-H stretch is in the middle of a part of the keyboard that has been, so to speak, damaged, and there are no neighboring notes, nothing is close to it. You have a unique smell, a unique vibration.So I went searching when I started in this game to convince myself that there was any degree of plausibility to this whole crazy story. I went searching for a type of molecule, any molecule, that would have that vibration and that \u2014 the obvious prediction was that it should absolutely smell of sulfur. If it didn\u2019t, the whole idea was toast, and I might as well move on to other things.Now, after searching high and low for several months, I discovered that there was a type of molecule called a Borane which has exactly the same vibration. Now the good news is, Boranes you can get hold of. The bad news is they\u2019re rocket fuels. Most of them explode spontaneously in contact with air, and when you call up the companies, they only give you minimum ten tons, OK? (Laughter) So this was not what they call a laboratory-scale experiment, and they wouldn\u2019t have liked it at my college.However, I managed to get a hold of a Borane eventually, and here is the beast. And it really does have the same \u2014 if you calculate, if you measure the vibrational frequencies, they are the same as S-H.Now, does it smell of sulfur? Well, if you go back in the literature, there\u2019s a man who knew more about Boranes than anyone alive then or since, Alfred Stock, he synthesized all of them. And in an enormous 40-page paper in German he says, at one point \u2014 my wife is German and she translated it for me \u2014 and at one point he says, \"ganz widerlich Geruch,\" an \"absolutely repulsive smell,\" which is good. Reminiscent of hydrogen sulfide. So this fact that Boranes smell of sulfur had been known since 1910, and utterly forgotten until 1997, 1998.Now, the slight fly in the ointment is this: that if we smell molecular vibrations, we must have a spectroscope in our nose. Now, this is a spectroscope, OK, on my laboratory bench. And it\u2019s fair to say that if you look up somebody\u2019s nose, you\u2019re unlikely to see anything resembling this. And this is the main objection to the theory.OK, great, we smell vibrations. How? All right? Now when people ask this kind of question, they neglect something, which is that physicists are really clever, unlike biologists. (Laughter) This is a joke. I\u2019m a biologist, OK? So it\u2019s a joke against myself.Bob Jacklovich and John Lamb at Ford Motor Company, in the days when Ford Motor was spending vast amounts of money on fundamental research, discovered a way to build a spectroscope that was intrinsically nano-scale. In other words, no mirrors, no lasers, no prisms, no nonsense, just a tiny device, and he built this device. And this device uses electron tunneling. Now, I could do the dance of electron tunneling, but I\u2019ve done a video instead, which is much more interesting. Here\u2019s how it works.Electrons are fuzzy creatures, and they can jump across gaps, but only at equal energy. If the energy differs, they can\u2019t jump. Unlike us, they won\u2019t fall off the cliff. OK. Now. If something absorbs the energy, the electron can travel. So here you have a system, you have something \u2014 and there\u2019s plenty of that stuff in biology \u2014 some substance giving an electron, and the electron tries to jump, and only when a molecule comes along that has the right vibration does the reaction happen, OK? This is the basis for the device that these two guys at Ford built.And every single part of this mechanism is actually plausible in biology. In other words, I\u2019ve taken off-the-shelf components, and I\u2019ve made a spectroscope. What\u2019s nice about this idea, if you have a philosophical bent of mind, is that then it tells you that the nose, the ear and the eye are all vibrational senses. Of course, it doesn\u2019t matter, because it could also be that they\u2019re not. But it has a certain \u2014 (Laughter) \u2014 it has a certain ring to it which is attractive to people who read too much 19th-century German literature.And then a magnificent thing happened: I left academia and joined the real world of business, and a company was created around my ideas to make new molecules using my method, along the lines of, let\u2019s put someone else\u2019s money where your mouth is. And one of the first things that happened was we started going around to fragrance companies asking for what they needed, because, of course, if you could calculate smell, you don\u2019t need chemists. You need a computer, a Mac will do it, if you know how to program the thing right, OK? So you can try a thousand molecules, you can try ten thousand molecules in a weekend, and then you only tell the chemists to make the right one. And so that\u2019s a direct path to making new odorants.And one of the first things that happened was we went to see some perfumers in France \u2014 and here\u2019s where I do my Charles Fleischer impression \u2014 and one of them says, \"You cannot make a coumarin.\" He says to me, \"I bet you cannot make a coumarin.\"Now, coumarin is a very common thing, a material, in fragrance which is derived from a bean that comes from South America. And it is the classic synthetic aroma chemical, OK? It\u2019s the molecule that has made men\u2019s fragrances smell the way they do since 1881, to be exact.And the problem is it\u2019s a carcinogen. So nobody likes particularly to \u2014 you know, aftershave with carcinogens. (Laughter) There are some reckless people, but it\u2019s not worth it, OK?So they asked us to make a new coumarin. And so we started doing calculations. And the first thing you do is you calculate the vibrational spectrum of coumarin, and you smooth it out, so that you have a nice picture of what the sort of chord, so to speak, of coumarin is. And then you start cranking the computer to find other molecules, related or unrelated, that have the same vibrations.And we actually, in this case, I\u2019m sorry to say, it happened \u2014 it was serendipitous. Because I got a phone call from our chief chemist and he said, look, I\u2019ve just found this such a beautiful reaction, that even if this compound doesn\u2019t smell of coumarin, I want to do it, it\u2019s just such a nifty, one step \u2014 I mean, chemists have weird minds \u2014 one step, 90 percent yield, you know, and you get this lovely crystalline compound. Let us try it.And I said, first of all, let me do the calculation on that compound, bottom right, which is related to coumarin, but has an extra pentagon inserted into the molecule. Calculate the vibrations, the purple spectrum is that new fellow, the white one is the old one. And the prediction is it should smell of coumarin. They made it ... and it smelled exactly like coumarin. And this is our new baby, called tonkene. You see, when you\u2019re a scientist, you\u2019re always selling ideas. And people are very resistant to ideas, and rightly so. Why should new ideas be accepted? But when you put a little 10-gram vial on the table in front of perfumers and it smells like coumarin, and it isn\u2019t coumarin, and you\u2019ve found it in three weeks, this focuses everybody\u2019s mind wonderfully. (Laughter) (Applause)And people often ask me, is your theory accepted? And I said, well, by whom? I mean most, you know \u2014 there\u2019s three attitudes: You\u2019re right, and I don\u2019t know why, which is the most rational one at this point. You\u2019re right, and I don\u2019t care how you do it, in a sense; you bring me the molecules, you know. And: You\u2019re completely wrong, and I\u2019m sure you\u2019re completely wrong.OK? Now, we\u2019re dealing with people who only want results, and this is the commercial world. And they tell us that even if we do it by astrology, they\u2019re happy. But we\u2019re not actually doing it by astrology. But for the last three years, I\u2019ve had what I consider to be the best job in the entire universe, which is to put my hobby \u2014 which is, you know, fragrance and all the magnificent things \u2014 plus a little bit of biophysics, a small amount of self-taught chemistry at the service of something that actually works.Thank you very much.

And I had to learn chemistry on the fly\n\n00:02:29.958 --> 00:02:35.958\nin the last three years. A very expensive high school chemistry education.\n\n00:02:35.958 --> 00:02:39.958\nThis has six carbon atoms, so \"hexa,\" hexene-1-ol.\n\n00:02:39.958 --> 00:02:43.958\nIt has one double bond, it has an alcohol on the end,\n\n00:02:43.958 --> 00:02:46.958\nso it\u2019s \"ol,\" and that\u2019s why they call it cis-3-hexene-1-ol.\n\n00:02:46.958 --> 00:02:49.958\nOnce you figure this out, you can really impress people at parties.\n\n00:02:49.958 --> 00:02:53.958\nThis smells of cut grass. Now, this is the skeleton of the molecule.\n\n00:02:53.958 --> 00:02:56.958\nIf you dress it up with atoms, hydrogen atoms --\n\n00:02:56.958 --> 00:02:58.958\nthat\u2019s what it looks like when you have it on your computer --\n\n00:02:58.958 --> 00:03:02.958\nbut actually it\u2019s sort of more like this, in the sense that the atoms have a certain\n\n00:03:02.958 --> 00:03:05.958\nsphere that you cannot penetrate. They repel.\n\n00:03:05.958 --> 00:03:11.958\nOK, now. Why does this thing smell of cut grass, OK?\n\n00:03:11.958 --> 00:03:17.958\nWhy doesn\u2019t it smell of potatoes or violets? Well, there are really two theories.\n\n00:03:17.958 --> 00:03:21.958\nBut the first theory is: it must be the shape.\n\n00:03:21.958 --> 00:03:23.958\nAnd that\u2019s a perfectly reasonable theory in the sense that\n\n00:03:23.958 --> 00:03:25.958\nalmost everything else in biology works by shape.\n\n00:03:25.958 --> 00:03:29.958\nEnzymes that chew things up, antibodies, it\u2019s all, you know,\n\n00:03:29.958 --> 00:03:35.958\nthe fit between a protein and whatever it is grabbing, in this case a smell.\n\n00:03:35.958 --> 00:03:38.958\nAnd I will try and explain to you what\u2019s wrong with this notion.\n\n00:03:38.958 --> 00:03:41.958\nAnd the other theory is that we smell molecular vibrations.\n\n00:03:41.958 --> 00:03:43.958\nNow, this is a totally insane idea.\n\n00:03:43.958 --> 00:03:47.958\nAnd when I first came across it in the early '90s, I thought my predecessor,\n\n00:03:47.958 --> 00:03:50.958\nMalcolm Dyson and Bob Wright, had really taken leave of their senses,\n\n00:03:50.958 --> 00:03:53.958\nand I\u2019ll explain to you why this was the case.\n\n00:03:53.958 --> 00:03:56.958\nHowever, I came to realize gradually that they may be right --\n\n00:03:56.958 --> 00:03:59.958\nand I have to convince all my colleagues that this is so, but I\u2019m working on it.\n\n00:03:59.958 --> 00:04:05.958\nHere\u2019s how shape works in normal receptors.\n\n00:04:05.958 --> 00:04:10.958\nYou have a molecule coming in, it gets into the protein, which is schematic here,\n\n00:04:10.958 --> 00:04:15.958\nand it causes this thing to switch, to turn, to move in some way\n\n00:04:15.958 --> 00:04:19.958\nby binding in certain parts.\n\n00:04:19.958 --> 00:04:21.958\nAnd the attraction, the forces, between the molecule and the protein\n\n00:04:21.958 --> 00:04:26.958\ncause the motion. This is a shape-based idea.\n\n00:04:26.958 --> 00:04:30.958\nNow, what\u2019s wrong with shape is summarized in this slide.\n\n00:04:30.958 --> 00:04:35.958\nThe way --I expect everybody to memorize these compounds.\n\n00:04:35.958 --> 00:04:40.958\nThis is one page of work from a chemist\u2019s workbook, OK?\n\n00:04:40.958 --> 00:04:42.958\nWorking for a fragrance company.\n\n00:04:42.958 --> 00:04:45.958\nHe\u2019s making 45 molecules, and he\u2019s looking for a sandalwood,\n\n00:04:45.958 --> 00:04:46.958\nsomething that smells of sandalwood.\n\n00:04:46.958 --> 00:04:48.958\nBecause there\u2019s a lot of money in sandalwoods.\n\n00:04:48.958 --> 00:04:55.958\nAnd of these 45 molecules, only 4629 actually smells of sandalwood.\n\n00:04:55.958 --> 00:04:58.958\nAnd he puts an exclamation mark, OK? This is an awful lot of work.\n\n\n00:04:58.958 --> 00:05:03.958\nThis actually is roughly, in man-years of work, 200,000 dollars roughly,\n\n00:05:03.958 --> 00:05:07.958\nif you keep them on the low salaries with no benefits.\n\n00:05:07.958 --> 00:05:09.958\nSo this is a profoundly inefficient process.\n\n00:05:09.958 --> 00:05:12.958\nAnd my definition of a theory is, it\u2019s not just something\n\n00:05:12.958 --> 00:05:14.958\nthat you teach people; it\u2019s labor saving.\n\n00:05:14.958 --> 00:05:17.958\nA theory is something that enables you to do less work.\n\n00:05:17.958 --> 00:05:23.958\nI love the idea of doing less work. So let me explain to you why -- a very simple fact\n\n00:05:23.958 --> 00:05:28.958\nthat tells you why this shape theory really does not work very well.\n\n00:05:28.958 --> 00:05:33.958\nThis is cis-3-hexene-1-ol. It smells of cut grass.\n\n00:05:33.958 --> 00:05:40.958\nThis is cis-3-hexene-1-thiol, and this smells of rotten eggs, OK?\n\n00:05:40.958 --> 00:05:45.958\nNow, you will have noticed that vodka never smells of rotten eggs.\n\n00:05:45.958 --> 00:05:49.958\nIf it does, you put the glass down, you go to a different bar.\n\n00:05:49.958 --> 00:05:54.958\nThis is -- in other words, we never get the O-H --\n\n00:05:54.958 --> 00:05:57.958\nwe never mistake it for an S-H, OK?\n\n00:05:57.958 --> 00:06:00.958\nLike, at no concentration, even pure, you know,\n\n00:06:00.958 --> 00:06:03.958\nif you smelt pure ethanol, it doesn\u2019t smell of rotten eggs.\n\n00:06:03.958 --> 00:06:10.958\nConversely, there is no concentration at which the sulfur compound will smell like vodka.\n\n00:06:10.958 --> 00:06:14.958\nIt\u2019s very hard to explain this by molecular recognition.\n\n\n00:06:14.958 --> 00:06:16.958\nNow, I showed this to a physicist friend of mine who has a profound distaste\n\n00:06:16.958 --> 00:06:20.958\nfor biology, and he says, \"That\u2019s easy! The things are a different color!\"\n\n00:06:20.958 --> 00:06:25.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:06:25.958 --> 00:06:30.958\nWe have to go a little beyond that. Now let me explain why vibrational theory has\n\n00:06:30.958 --> 00:06:34.958\nsome sort of interest in it. These molecules, as you saw in the beginning,\n\n00:06:34.958 --> 00:06:36.958\nthe building blocks had springs connecting them to each other.\n\n00:06:36.958 --> 00:06:39.958\nIn fact, molecules are able to vibrate at a set of frequencies\n\n00:06:39.958 --> 00:06:43.958\nwhich are very specific for each molecule and for the bonds connecting them.\n\n00:06:43.958 --> 00:06:51.958\nSo this is the sound of the O-H stretch, translated into the audible range.\n\n00:06:52.958 --> 00:06:54.958\nS-H, quite a different frequency.\n\n00:06:54.958 --> 00:06:58.958\nNow, this is kind of interesting, because it tells you\n\n00:06:58.958 --> 00:07:01.958\nthat you should be looking for a particular fact, which is this:\n\n00:07:01.958 --> 00:07:05.958\nnothing in the world smells like rotten eggs except S-H, OK?\n\n00:07:05.958 --> 00:07:12.958\nNow, Fact B: nothing in the world has that frequency except S-H.\n\n00:07:12.958 --> 00:07:14.958\nIf you look on this, imagine a piano keyboard.\n\n00:07:14.958 --> 00:07:18.958\nThe S-H stretch is in the middle of a part of the keyboard\n\n00:07:18.958 --> 00:07:20.958\nthat has been, so to speak, damaged,\n\n00:07:20.958 --> 00:07:23.958\nand there are no neighboring notes, nothing is close to it.\n\n00:07:23.958 --> 00:07:25.958\nYou have a unique smell, a unique vibration.\n\n\n00:07:25.958 --> 00:07:27.958\nSo I went searching when I started in this game\n\n00:07:27.958 --> 00:07:30.958\nto convince myself that there was any degree of plausibility\n\n00:07:30.958 --> 00:07:32.958\nto this whole crazy story.\n\n00:07:32.958 --> 00:07:35.958\nI went searching for a type of molecule, any molecule,\n\n00:07:35.958 --> 00:07:40.958\nthat would have that vibration and that -- the obvious prediction\n\n00:07:40.958 --> 00:07:42.958\nwas that it should absolutely smell of sulfur.\n\n00:07:42.958 --> 00:07:48.958\nIf it didn\u2019t, the whole idea was toast, and I might as well move on to other things.\n\n00:07:48.958 --> 00:07:52.958\nNow, after searching high and low for several months,\n\n00:07:52.958 --> 00:07:57.958\nI discovered that there was a type of molecule called a Borane\n\n00:07:57.958 --> 00:07:59.958\nwhich has exactly the same vibration.\n\n00:07:59.958 --> 00:08:02.958\nNow the good news is, Boranes you can get hold of.\n\n00:08:02.958 --> 00:08:05.958\nThe bad news is they\u2019re rocket fuels.\n\n00:08:05.958 --> 00:08:08.958\nMost of them explode spontaneously in contact with air,\n\n00:08:08.958 --> 00:08:12.958\nand when you call up the companies, they only give you minimum ten tons, OK?\n\n00:08:12.958 --> 00:08:15.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:08:15.958 --> 00:08:18.958\nSo this was not what they call a laboratory-scale experiment,\n\n\n00:08:18.958 --> 00:08:20.958\nand they wouldn\u2019t have liked it at my college.\n\n00:08:20.958 --> 00:08:28.958\nHowever, I managed to get a hold of a Borane eventually, and here is the beast.\n\n00:08:28.958 --> 00:08:30.958\nAnd it really does have the same -- if you calculate,\n\n00:08:30.958 --> 00:08:34.958\nif you measure the vibrational frequencies, they are the same as S-H.\n\n00:08:34.958 --> 00:08:39.958\nNow, does it smell of sulfur? Well, if you go back in the literature,\n\n00:08:39.958 --> 00:08:42.958\nthere\u2019s a man who knew more about Boranes than anyone\n\n00:08:42.958 --> 00:08:47.958\nalive then or since, Alfred Stock, he synthesized all of them.\n\n00:08:47.958 --> 00:08:53.958\nAnd in an enormous 40-page paper in German he says, at one point --\n\n00:08:53.958 --> 00:08:56.958\nmy wife is German and she translated it for me --\n\n00:08:56.958 --> 00:08:58.958\nand at one point he says, \"ganz widerlich Geruch,\"\n\n\n00:08:58.958 --> 00:09:04.958\nan \"absolutely repulsive smell,\" which is good. Reminiscent of hydrogen sulfide.\n\n00:09:04.958 --> 00:09:07.958\nSo this fact that Boranes smell of sulfur\n\n00:09:07.958 --> 00:09:14.958\nhad been known since 1910, and utterly forgotten until 1997, 1998.\n\n00:09:14.958 --> 00:09:18.958\nNow, the slight fly in the ointment is this: that\n\n00:09:18.958 --> 00:09:23.958\nif we smell molecular vibrations, we must have a spectroscope in our nose.\n\n00:09:23.958 --> 00:09:28.958\nNow, this is a spectroscope, OK, on my laboratory bench.\n\n00:09:28.958 --> 00:09:30.958\nAnd it\u2019s fair to say that if you look up somebody\u2019s nose,\n\n00:09:30.958 --> 00:09:33.958\nyou\u2019re unlikely to see anything resembling this.\n\n00:09:33.958 --> 00:09:35.958\nAnd this is the main objection to the theory.\n\n00:09:35.958 --> 00:09:40.958\nOK, great, we smell vibrations. How? All right?\n\n00:09:40.958 --> 00:09:42.958\nNow when people ask this kind of question, they neglect something,\n\n00:09:42.958 --> 00:09:46.958\nwhich is that physicists are really clever, unlike biologists.\n\n00:09:46.958 --> 00:09:49.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:09:49.958 --> 00:09:51.958\nThis is a joke. I\u2019m a biologist, OK?\n\n00:09:51.958 --> 00:09:52.958\nSo it\u2019s a joke against myself.\n\n00:09:52.958 --> 00:09:55.958\nBob Jacklovich and John Lamb at Ford Motor Company,\n\n00:09:55.958 --> 00:09:57.958\nin the days when Ford Motor was spending vast amounts of money\n\n00:09:57.958 --> 00:10:01.958\non fundamental research, discovered a way\n\n00:10:01.958 --> 00:10:05.958\nto build a spectroscope that was intrinsically nano-scale.\n\n00:10:05.958 --> 00:10:08.958\nIn other words, no mirrors, no lasers, no prisms, no nonsense,\n\n00:10:08.958 --> 00:10:13.958\njust a tiny device, and he built this device. And this device uses electron tunneling.\n\n00:10:13.958 --> 00:10:16.958\nNow, I could do the dance of electron tunneling,\n\n00:10:16.958 --> 00:10:21.958\nbut I\u2019ve done a video instead, which is much more interesting. Here\u2019s how it works.\n\n00:10:21.958 --> 00:10:25.958\nElectrons are fuzzy creatures, and they can jump across gaps,\n\n00:10:25.958 --> 00:10:30.958\nbut only at equal energy. If the energy differs, they can\u2019t jump.\n\n00:10:30.958 --> 00:10:32.958\nUnlike us, they won\u2019t fall off the cliff.\n\n00:10:32.958 --> 00:10:39.958\nOK. Now. If something absorbs the energy, the electron can travel.\n\n00:10:39.958 --> 00:10:42.958\nSo here you have a system, you have something --\n\n00:10:42.958 --> 00:10:43.958\nand there\u2019s plenty of that stuff in biology --\n\n00:10:43.958 --> 00:10:48.958\nsome substance giving an electron, and the electron tries to jump,\n\n00:10:48.958 --> 00:10:52.958\nand only when a molecule comes along that has the right vibration\n\n00:10:52.958 --> 00:10:54.958\ndoes the reaction happen, OK?\n\n00:10:54.958 --> 00:10:58.958\nThis is the basis for the device that these two guys at Ford built.\n\n00:10:58.958 --> 00:11:05.958\nAnd every single part of this mechanism is actually plausible in biology.\n\n00:11:05.958 --> 00:11:06.958\nIn other words, I\u2019ve taken off-the-shelf components,\n\n00:11:06.958 --> 00:11:08.958\nand I\u2019ve made a spectroscope.\n\n00:11:08.958 --> 00:11:12.958\nWhat\u2019s nice about this idea, if you have a philosophical bent of mind,\n\n00:11:12.958 --> 00:11:14.958\nis that then it tells you that the nose,\n\n00:11:14.958 --> 00:11:17.958\nthe ear and the eye are all vibrational senses.\n\n00:11:17.958 --> 00:11:21.958\nOf course, it doesn\u2019t matter, because it could also be that they\u2019re not.\n\n00:11:21.958 --> 00:11:22.958\nBut it has a certain --\n\n00:11:22.958 --> 00:11:24.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:11:24.958 --> 00:11:28.958\n-- it has a certain ring to it which is attractive to people\n\n00:11:28.958 --> 00:11:32.958\nwho read too much 19th-century German literature.\n\n00:11:32.958 --> 00:11:33.958\nAnd then a magnificent thing happened:\n\n00:11:33.958 --> 00:11:39.958\nI left academia and joined the real world of business,\n\n00:11:39.958 --> 00:11:42.958\nand a company was created around my ideas\n\n00:11:42.958 --> 00:11:45.958\nto make new molecules using my method,\n\n00:11:45.958 --> 00:11:49.958\nalong the lines of, let\u2019s put someone else\u2019s money where your mouth is.\n\n00:11:49.958 --> 00:11:53.958\nAnd one of the first things that happened was\n\n00:11:53.958 --> 00:11:55.958\nwe started going around to fragrance companies\n\n00:11:55.958 --> 00:11:59.958\nasking for what they needed, because, of course,\n\n00:11:59.958 --> 00:12:01.958\nif you could calculate smell, you don\u2019t need chemists.\n\n00:12:01.958 --> 00:12:05.958\nYou need a computer, a Mac will do it, if you know how to program the thing right,\n\n00:12:05.958 --> 00:12:09.958\nOK? So you can try a thousand molecules,\n\n00:12:09.958 --> 00:12:12.958\nyou can try ten thousand molecules in a weekend,\n\n00:12:12.958 --> 00:12:15.958\nand then you only tell the chemists to make the right one.\n\n00:12:15.958 --> 00:12:19.958\nAnd so that\u2019s a direct path to making new odorants.\n\n00:12:19.958 --> 00:12:20.958\nAnd one of the first things that happened was\n\n00:12:20.958 --> 00:12:22.958\nwe went to see some perfumers in France --\n\n00:12:22.958 --> 00:12:24.958\nand here\u2019s where I do my Charles Fleischer impression --\n\n00:12:24.958 --> 00:12:28.958\nand one of them says, \"You cannot make a coumarin.\"\n\n00:12:28.958 --> 00:12:31.958\nHe says to me, \"I bet you cannot make a coumarin.\"\n\n00:12:31.958 --> 00:12:35.958\nNow, coumarin is a very common thing, a material,\n\n00:12:35.958 --> 00:12:38.958\nin fragrance which is derived from a bean that comes from South America.\n\n00:12:38.958 --> 00:12:42.958\nAnd it is the classic synthetic aroma chemical, OK?\n\n00:12:42.958 --> 00:12:46.958\nIt\u2019s the molecule that has made men\u2019s fragrances\n\n00:12:46.958 --> 00:12:49.958\nsmell the way they do since 1881, to be exact.\n\n00:12:49.958 --> 00:12:52.958\nAnd the problem is it\u2019s a carcinogen.\n\n00:12:52.958 --> 00:12:58.958\nSo nobody likes particularly to -- you know, aftershave with carcinogens.\n\n00:12:58.958 --> 00:13:00.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:13:00.958 --> 00:13:03.958\nThere are some reckless people, but it\u2019s not worth it, OK?\n\n00:13:03.958 --> 00:13:08.958\nSo they asked us to make a new coumarin. And so we started doing calculations.\n\n00:13:08.958 --> 00:13:11.958\nAnd the first thing you do is you calculate the vibrational spectrum\n\n00:13:11.958 --> 00:13:12.958\nof coumarin, and you smooth it out,\n\n00:13:12.958 --> 00:13:18.958\nso that you have a nice picture of what the sort of chord, so to speak, of coumarin is.\n\n00:13:18.958 --> 00:13:24.958\nAnd then you start cranking the computer to find other molecules,\n\n00:13:24.958 --> 00:13:27.958\nrelated or unrelated, that have the same vibrations.\n\n00:13:27.958 --> 00:13:31.958\nAnd we actually, in this case, I\u2019m sorry to say,\n\n00:13:31.958 --> 00:13:33.958\nit happened -- it was serendipitous.\n\n00:13:33.958 --> 00:13:36.958\nBecause I got a phone call from our chief chemist\n\n00:13:36.958 --> 00:13:41.958\nand he said, look, I\u2019ve just found this such a beautiful reaction,\n\n00:13:41.958 --> 00:13:42.958\nthat even if this compound doesn\u2019t smell of coumarin,\n\n00:13:42.958 --> 00:13:45.958\nI want to do it, it\u2019s just such a nifty,\n\n00:13:45.958 --> 00:13:48.958\none step -- I mean, chemists have weird minds --\n\n00:13:48.958 --> 00:13:52.958\none step, 90 percent yield, you know, and you get this lovely\n\n00:13:52.958 --> 00:13:54.958\ncrystalline compound. Let us try it.\n\n00:13:54.958 --> 00:13:58.958\nAnd I said, first of all, let me do the calculation on that compound, bottom right,\n\n00:13:58.958 --> 00:14:04.958\nwhich is related to coumarin, but has an extra pentagon inserted into the molecule.\n\n00:14:04.958 --> 00:14:09.958\nCalculate the vibrations, the purple spectrum is that new fellow,\n\n00:14:09.958 --> 00:14:10.958\nthe white one is the old one.\n\n00:14:10.958 --> 00:14:14.958\nAnd the prediction is it should smell of coumarin.\n\n00:14:14.958 --> 00:14:22.958\nThey made it ... and it smelled exactly like coumarin.\n\n00:14:22.958 --> 00:14:27.958\nAnd this is our new baby, called tonkene.\n\n00:14:27.958 --> 00:14:29.958\nYou see, when you\u2019re a scientist, you\u2019re always selling ideas.\n\n00:14:29.958 --> 00:14:33.958\nAnd people are very resistant to ideas, and rightly so.\n\n00:14:33.958 --> 00:14:35.958\nWhy should new ideas be accepted?\n\n00:14:35.958 --> 00:14:41.958\nBut when you put a little 10-gram vial on the table in front of perfumers\n\n00:14:41.958 --> 00:14:43.958\nand it smells like coumarin, and it isn\u2019t coumarin,\n\n00:14:43.958 --> 00:14:45.958\nand you\u2019ve found it in three weeks,\n\n00:14:45.958 --> 00:14:48.958\nthis focuses everybody\u2019s mind wonderfully.\n\n00:14:48.958 --> 00:14:49.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:14:49.958 --> 00:14:55.958\n(Applause)\n\n00:14:55.958 --> 00:14:59.958\nAnd people often ask me, is your theory accepted?\n\n00:14:59.958 --> 00:15:04.958\nAnd I said, well, by whom? I mean most, you know -- there\u2019s three attitudes:\n\n00:15:04.958 --> 00:15:08.958\nYou\u2019re right, and I don\u2019t know why, which is the most rational one at this point.\n\n00:15:08.958 --> 00:15:12.958\nYou\u2019re right, and I don\u2019t care how you do it, in a sense;\n\n00:15:12.958 --> 00:15:13.958\nyou bring me the molecules, you know.\n\n00:15:13.958 --> 00:15:16.958\nAnd: You\u2019re completely wrong, and I\u2019m sure you\u2019re completely wrong.\n\n00:15:16.958 --> 00:15:19.958\nOK? Now, we\u2019re dealing with people who only want results,\n\n00:15:19.958 --> 00:15:21.958\nand this is the commercial world.\n\n00:15:21.958 --> 00:15:26.958\nAnd they tell us that even if we do it by astrology, they\u2019re happy.\n\n00:15:26.958 --> 00:15:29.958\nBut we\u2019re not actually doing it by astrology.\n\n00:15:29.958 --> 00:15:31.958\nBut for the last three years, I\u2019ve had what I consider to be\n\n00:15:31.958 --> 00:15:36.958\nthe best job in the entire universe, which is to put my hobby --\n\n00:15:36.958 --> 00:15:38.958\nwhich is, you know, fragrance and all the magnificent things --\n\n00:15:38.958 --> 00:15:43.958\nplus a little bit of biophysics, a small amount of self-taught chemistry\n\n00:15:43.958 --> 00:15:45.958\nat the service of something that actually works.\n\n00:15:45.958 --> 00:15:46.958\nThank you very much.\n\n00:15:46.958 --> 00:15:47.958\n(Applause)"}, {"title": "Science and democracy", "duration": "745", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/lee_smolin_on_science_and_democracy", "transcript": "So, about three years ago I was in London, and somebody called Howard Burton came to me and said, I represent a group of people, and we want to start an institute in theoretical physics. We have about 120 million dollars, and we want to do it well. We want to be in the forefront fields, and we want to do it differently. We want to get out of this thing where the young people have all the ideas, and the old people have all the power and decide what science gets done. It took me about 25 seconds to decide that that was a good idea.Three years later, we have the Perimeter Institute for Theoretical Physics in Waterloo, Ontario. It\u2019s the most exciting job I\u2019ve ever had. And it\u2019s the first time I\u2019ve had a job where I\u2019m afraid to go away because of everything that\u2019s going to happen in this week when I\u2019m here. (Laughter) But in any case, what I\u2019m going to do in my little bit of time is take you on a quick tour of some of the things that we talk about and we think about. So, we think a lot about what really makes science work? The first thing that anybody who knows science, and has been around science, is that the stuff you learn in school as a scientific method is wrong. There is no method. On the other hand, somehow we manage to reason together as a community, from incomplete evidence to conclusions that we all agree about. And this is, by the way, something that a democratic society also has to do.So how does it work? Well, my belief is that it works because scientists are a community bound together by an ethics. And here are some of the ethical principles. I\u2019m not going to read them all to you because I\u2019m not in teacher mode. I\u2019m in entertain, amaze mode. (Laughter)But one of the principles is that everybody who is part of the community gets to fight and argue as hard as they can for what they believe. But we\u2019re all disciplined by the understanding that the only people who are going to decide, you know, whether I\u2019m right or somebody else is right, are the people in our community in the next generation, in 30 and 50 years. So it\u2019s this combination of respect for the tradition and community we\u2019re in, and rebellion that the community requires to get anywhere, that makes science work. And being in this process of being in a community that reasons from shared evidence to conclusions, I believe, teaches us about democracy. Not only is there a relationship between the ethics of science and the ethics of being a citizen in democracy, but there has been, historically, a relationship between how people think about space and time, and what the cosmos is, and how people think about the society that they live in.And I want to talk about three stages in that evolution. The first science of cosmology that was anything like science was Aristotelian science, and that was hierarchical. The earth is in the center, then there are these crystal spheres, the sun, the moon, the planets and finally the celestial sphere, where the stars are. And everything in this universe has a place. And Aristotle\u2019s law of motion was that everything goes to its natural place, which was of course, the rule of the society that Aristotle lived in, and more importantly, the medieval society that, through Christianity, embraced Aristotle and blessed it. And the idea is that everything is defined. Where something is, is defined with respect to this last sphere, the celestial sphere, outside of which is this eternal, perfect realm, where lives God, who is the ultimate judge of everything.So that is both Aristotelian cosmology, and in a certain sense, medieval society. Now, in the 17th century there was a revolution in thinking about space and time and motion and so forth of Newton. And at the same time there was a revolution in social thought of John Locke and his collaborators. And they were very closely associated. In fact, Newton and Locke were friends. Their way of thinking about space and time and motion on the one hand, and a society on the other hand, were closely related.And let me show you. In a Newtonian universe, there\u2019s no center \u2014 thank you. There are particles and they move around with respect to a fixed, absolute framework of space and time. It\u2019s meaningful to say absolutely where something is in space, because that\u2019s defined, not with respect to say, where other things are, but with respect to this absolute notion of space, which for Newton was God.Now, similarly, in Locke\u2019s society there are individuals who have certain rights, properties in a formal sense, and those are defined with respect to some absolute, abstract notions of rights and justice, and so forth, which are independent of what else has happened in the society. Of who else there is, of the history and so forth. There is also an omniscient observer who knows everything, who is God, who is in a certain sense outside the universe, because he has no role in anything that happens, but is in a certain sense everywhere, because space is just the way that God knows where everything is, according to Newton, OK?So this is the foundations of what\u2019s called, traditionally, liberal political theory and Newtonian physics. Now, in the 20th century we had a revolution that was initiated at the beginning of the 20th century, and which is still going on. It was begun with the invention of relativity theory and quantum theory. And merging them together to make the final quantum theory of space and time and gravity, is the culmination of that, something that\u2019s going on right now. And in this universe there\u2019s nothing fixed and absolute. Zilch, OK. This universe is described by being a network of relationships.Space is just one aspect, so there\u2019s no meaning to say absolutely where something is. There\u2019s only where it is relative to everything else that is. And this network of relations is ever-evolving. So we call it a relational universe. All properties of things are about these kinds of relationships. And also, if you\u2019re embedded in such a network of relationships, your view of the world has to do with what information comes to you through the network of relations. And there\u2019s no place for an omniscient observer or an outside intelligence knowing everything and making everything. So this is general relativity, this is quantum theory. This is also, if you talk to legal scholars, the foundations of new ideas in legal thought. They\u2019re thinking about the same things. And not only that, they make the analogy to relativity theory and cosmology often. So there\u2019s an interesting discussion going on there. This last view of cosmology is called the relational view.So the main slogan here is that there\u2019s nothing outside the universe, which means that there\u2019s no place to put an explanation for something outside. So in such a relational universe, if you come upon something that\u2019s ordered and structured, like this device here, or that device there, or something beautiful, like all the living things, all of you guys in the room \u2014 \"guys\" in physics, by the way, is a generic term: men and women. (Laughter)Then you want to know, you\u2019re a person, you want to know how is it made. And in a relational universe the only possible explanation was, somehow it made itself. There must be mechanisms of self-organization inside the universe that make things. Because there\u2019s no place to put a maker outside, as there was in the Aristotelian and the Newtonian universe. So in a relational universe we must have processes of self-organization.Now, Darwin taught us that there are processes of self-organization that suffice to explain all of us and everything we see. So it works. But not only that, if you think about how natural selection works, then it turns out that natural selection would only make sense in such a relational universe. That is, natural selection works on properties, like fitness, which are about relationships of some species to some other species. Darwin wouldn\u2019t make sense in an Aristotelian universe, and wouldn\u2019t really make sense in a Newtonian universe.So a theory of biology based on natural selection requires a relational notion of what are the properties of biological systems. And if you push that all the way down, really, it makes the best sense in a relational universe where all properties are relational. Now, not only that, but Einstein taught us that gravity is the result of the world being relational. If it wasn\u2019t for gravity, there wouldn\u2019t be life, because gravity causes stars to form and live for a very long time, keeping pieces of the world, like the surface of the Earth, out of thermal equilibrium for billions of years so life can evolve.In the 20th century, we saw the independent development of two big themes in science. In the biological sciences, they explored the implications of the notion that order and complexity and structure arise in a self-organized way. That was the triumph of Neo-Darwinism and so forth. And slowly, that idea is leaking out to the cognitive sciences, the human sciences, economics, et cetera. At the same time, we physicists have been busy trying to make sense of and build on and integrate the discoveries of quantum theory and relativity.And what we\u2019ve been working out is the implications, really, of the idea that the universe is made up of relations. 21st-century science is going to be driven by the integration of these two ideas: the triumph of relational ways of thinking about the world, on the one hand, and self-organization or Darwinian ways of thinking about the world, on the other hand. And also, is that in the 21st century our thinking about space and time and cosmology, and our thinking about society are both going to continue to evolve. And what they\u2019re evolving towards is the union of these two big ideas, Darwinism and relationalism.Now, if you think about democracy from this perspective, a new pluralistic notion of democracy would be one that recognizes that there are many different interests, many different agendas, many different individuals, many different points of view. Each one is incomplete, because you\u2019re embedded in a network of relationships. Any actor in a democracy is embedded in a network of relationships. And you understand some things better than other things, and because of that there\u2019s a continual jostling and give and take, which is politics. And politics is, in the ideal sense, the way in which we continually address our network of relations in order to achieve a better life and a better society.And I also think that science will never go away and \u2014 I\u2019m finishing on this line. (Laughter) In fact, I\u2019m finished. Science will never go away.", "id": 394, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:11.958 --> 00:00:15.958\nSo, about three years ago I was in London,\n\n00:00:15.958 --> 00:00:20.958\nand somebody called Howard Burton came to me and said,\n\n00:00:20.958 --> 00:00:22.958\nI represent a group of people,\n\n00:00:22.958 --> 00:00:26.958\nand we want to start an institute in theoretical physics.\n\n00:00:26.958 --> 00:00:31.958\nWe have about 120 million dollars, and we want to do it well.\n\n00:00:31.958 --> 00:00:33.958\nWe want to be in the forefront fields,\n\n00:00:33.958 --> 00:00:35.958\nand we want to do it differently.\n\n00:00:35.958 --> 00:00:37.958\nWe want to get out of this thing\n\n00:00:37.958 --> 00:00:40.958\nwhere the young people have all the ideas, and the old people have all the power\n\n00:00:40.958 --> 00:00:43.958\nand decide what science gets done.\n\n00:00:43.958 --> 00:00:46.958\nIt took me about 25 seconds to decide that that was a good idea.\n\n00:00:46.958 --> 00:00:51.958\nThree years later, we have the Perimeter Institute for Theoretical Physics\n\n00:00:51.958 --> 00:00:56.958\nin Waterloo, Ontario. It\u2019s the most exciting job I\u2019ve ever had.\n\n00:00:56.958 --> 00:01:00.958\nAnd it\u2019s the first time I\u2019ve had a job where I\u2019m afraid to go away\n\n00:01:00.958 --> 00:01:04.958\nbecause of everything that\u2019s going to happen in this week when I\u2019m here.\n\n00:01:04.958 --> 00:01:06.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:01:06.958 --> 00:01:10.958\nBut in any case, what I\u2019m going to do in my little bit of time\n\n00:01:10.958 --> 00:01:13.958\nis take you on a quick tour of some of the things\n\n00:01:13.958 --> 00:01:16.958\nthat we talk about and we think about.\n\n00:01:16.958 --> 00:01:19.958\nSo, we think a lot about what really makes science work?\n\n00:01:19.958 --> 00:01:22.958\nThe first thing that anybody who knows science,\n\n00:01:22.958 --> 00:01:23.958\nand has been around science,\n\n00:01:23.958 --> 00:01:25.958\nis that the stuff you learn in school as a scientific method\n\n00:01:25.958 --> 00:01:28.958\nis wrong. There is no method.\n\n00:01:28.958 --> 00:01:32.958\nOn the other hand, somehow we manage to reason together\n\n00:01:32.958 --> 00:01:35.958\nas a community, from incomplete evidence\n\n00:01:35.958 --> 00:01:38.958\nto conclusions that we all agree about.\n\n00:01:38.958 --> 00:01:42.958\nAnd this is, by the way, something that a democratic society also has to do.\n\n00:01:42.958 --> 00:01:44.958\nSo how does it work?\n\n00:01:44.958 --> 00:01:47.958\nWell, my belief is that it works\n\n00:01:47.958 --> 00:01:51.958\nbecause scientists are a community bound together by an ethics.\n\n00:01:51.958 --> 00:01:53.958\nAnd here are some of the ethical principles.\n\n00:01:53.958 --> 00:01:56.958\nI\u2019m not going to read them all to you because I\u2019m not in teacher mode.\n\n00:01:56.958 --> 00:01:59.958\nI\u2019m in entertain, amaze mode.\n\n00:01:59.958 --> 00:02:02.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:02:02.958 --> 00:02:06.958\nBut one of the principles is that everybody\n\n00:02:06.958 --> 00:02:09.958\nwho is part of the community gets to fight and argue\n\n00:02:09.958 --> 00:02:12.958\nas hard as they can for what they believe.\n\n00:02:12.958 --> 00:02:15.958\nBut we\u2019re all disciplined by the understanding\n\n00:02:15.958 --> 00:02:17.958\nthat the only people who are going to decide, you know,\n\n00:02:17.958 --> 00:02:20.958\nwhether I\u2019m right or somebody else is right,\n\n00:02:20.958 --> 00:02:23.958\nare the people in our community in the next generation,\n\n00:02:23.958 --> 00:02:25.958\nin 30 and 50 years.\n\n00:02:25.958 --> 00:02:28.958\nSo it\u2019s this combination of respect\n\n00:02:28.958 --> 00:02:30.958\nfor the tradition and community we\u2019re in,\n\n00:02:30.958 --> 00:02:33.958\nand rebellion that the community requires to get anywhere,\n\n00:02:33.958 --> 00:02:36.958\nthat makes science work.\n\n00:02:36.958 --> 00:02:41.958\nAnd being in this process of being in a community\n\n00:02:41.958 --> 00:02:45.958\nthat reasons from shared evidence to conclusions,\n\n00:02:45.958 --> 00:02:49.958\nI believe, teaches us about democracy.\n\n00:02:49.958 --> 00:02:52.958\nNot only is there a relationship between the ethics of science\n\n00:02:52.958 --> 00:02:55.958\nand the ethics of being a citizen in democracy,\n\n00:02:55.958 --> 00:02:58.958\nbut there has been, historically, a relationship\n\n00:02:58.958 --> 00:03:04.958\nbetween how people think about space and time, and what the cosmos is,\n\n00:03:04.958 --> 00:03:08.958\nand how people think about the society that they live in.\n\n00:03:08.958 --> 00:03:13.958\nAnd I want to talk about three stages in that evolution.\n\n00:03:13.958 --> 00:03:17.958\nThe first science of cosmology that was anything like science\n\n00:03:17.958 --> 00:03:21.958\nwas Aristotelian science, and that was hierarchical.\n\n00:03:21.958 --> 00:03:25.958\nThe earth is in the center, then there are these crystal spheres,\n\n00:03:25.958 --> 00:03:29.958\nthe sun, the moon, the planets and finally the celestial sphere,\n\n00:03:29.958 --> 00:03:33.958\nwhere the stars are. And everything in this universe has a place.\n\n00:03:33.958 --> 00:03:36.958\nAnd Aristotle\u2019s law of motion was that everything\n\n00:03:36.958 --> 00:03:38.958\ngoes to its natural place, which was of course,\n\n00:03:38.958 --> 00:03:42.958\nthe rule of the society that Aristotle lived in,\n\n00:03:42.958 --> 00:03:45.958\nand more importantly, the medieval society that, through Christianity,\n\n00:03:45.958 --> 00:03:49.958\nembraced Aristotle and blessed it.\n\n00:03:49.958 --> 00:03:52.958\nAnd the idea is that everything is defined.\n\n00:03:52.958 --> 00:03:57.958\nWhere something is, is defined with respect to this last sphere,\n\n00:03:57.958 --> 00:03:59.958\nthe celestial sphere, outside of which is this eternal,\n\n00:03:59.958 --> 00:04:02.958\nperfect realm, where lives God,\n\n00:04:02.958 --> 00:04:05.958\nwho is the ultimate judge of everything.\n\n00:04:05.958 --> 00:04:07.958\nSo that is both Aristotelian cosmology,\n\n00:04:07.958 --> 00:04:10.958\nand in a certain sense, medieval society.\n\n00:04:10.958 --> 00:04:15.958\nNow, in the 17th century there was a revolution in thinking about\n\n00:04:15.958 --> 00:04:19.958\nspace and time and motion and so forth of Newton.\n\n00:04:19.958 --> 00:04:23.958\nAnd at the same time there was a revolution in social thought\n\n00:04:23.958 --> 00:04:26.958\nof John Locke and his collaborators.\n\n00:04:26.958 --> 00:04:27.958\nAnd they were very closely associated.\n\n00:04:27.958 --> 00:04:30.958\nIn fact, Newton and Locke were friends.\n\n00:04:30.958 --> 00:04:35.958\nTheir way of thinking about space and time and motion on the one hand,\n\n00:04:35.958 --> 00:04:39.958\nand a society on the other hand, were closely related.\n\n00:04:39.958 --> 00:04:40.958\nAnd let me show you.\n\n00:04:40.958 --> 00:04:45.958\nIn a Newtonian universe, there\u2019s no center -- thank you.\n\n00:04:45.958 --> 00:04:48.958\nThere are particles and they move around\n\n00:04:48.958 --> 00:04:53.958\nwith respect to a fixed, absolute framework of space and time.\n\n00:04:53.958 --> 00:04:57.958\nIt\u2019s meaningful to say absolutely where something is in space,\n\n00:04:57.958 --> 00:05:01.958\nbecause that\u2019s defined, not with respect to say, where other things are,\n\n00:05:01.958 --> 00:05:03.958\nbut with respect to this absolute notion of space,\n\n00:05:03.958 --> 00:05:05.958\nwhich for Newton was God.\n\n00:05:05.958 --> 00:05:10.958\nNow, similarly, in Locke\u2019s society there are individuals\n\n00:05:10.958 --> 00:05:13.958\nwho have certain rights, properties in a formal sense,\n\n00:05:13.958 --> 00:05:17.958\nand those are defined with respect to some absolute,\n\n00:05:17.958 --> 00:05:21.958\nabstract notions of rights and justice, and so forth,\n\n00:05:21.958 --> 00:05:26.958\nwhich are independent of what else has happened in the society.\n\n00:05:26.958 --> 00:05:29.958\nOf who else there is, of the history and so forth.\n\n00:05:29.958 --> 00:05:32.958\nThere is also an omniscient observer\n\n00:05:32.958 --> 00:05:34.958\nwho knows everything, who is God,\n\n00:05:34.958 --> 00:05:37.958\nwho is in a certain sense outside the universe,\n\n00:05:37.958 --> 00:05:39.958\nbecause he has no role in anything that happens,\n\n00:05:39.958 --> 00:05:41.958\nbut is in a certain sense everywhere,\n\n00:05:41.958 --> 00:05:44.958\nbecause space is just the way that God knows\n\n00:05:44.958 --> 00:05:48.958\nwhere everything is, according to Newton, OK?\n\n00:05:48.958 --> 00:05:52.958\nSo this is the foundations of what\u2019s called, traditionally,\n\n00:05:52.958 --> 00:05:56.958\nliberal political theory and Newtonian physics.\n\n00:05:56.958 --> 00:06:00.958\nNow, in the 20th century we had a revolution\n\n00:06:00.958 --> 00:06:03.958\nthat was initiated at the beginning of the 20th century,\n\n00:06:03.958 --> 00:06:06.958\nand which is still going on.\n\n00:06:06.958 --> 00:06:07.958\nIt was begun with the invention\n\n00:06:07.958 --> 00:06:10.958\nof relativity theory and quantum theory.\n\n00:06:10.958 --> 00:06:13.958\nAnd merging them together to make the final quantum theory\n\n00:06:13.958 --> 00:06:18.958\nof space and time and gravity, is the culmination of that,\n\n00:06:18.958 --> 00:06:20.958\nsomething that\u2019s going on right now.\n\n00:06:20.958 --> 00:06:25.958\nAnd in this universe there\u2019s nothing fixed and absolute. Zilch, OK.\n\n00:06:25.958 --> 00:06:30.958\nThis universe is described by being a network of relationships.\n\n00:06:30.958 --> 00:06:33.958\nSpace is just one aspect, so there\u2019s no meaning to say\n\n00:06:33.958 --> 00:06:35.958\nabsolutely where something is.\n\n00:06:35.958 --> 00:06:38.958\nThere\u2019s only where it is relative to everything else that is.\n\n00:06:38.958 --> 00:06:42.958\nAnd this network of relations is ever-evolving.\n\n00:06:42.958 --> 00:06:44.958\nSo we call it a relational universe.\n\n00:06:44.958 --> 00:06:48.958\nAll properties of things are about these kinds of relationships.\n\n00:06:48.958 --> 00:06:51.958\nAnd also, if you\u2019re embedded in such a network of relationships,\n\n00:06:51.958 --> 00:06:55.958\nyour view of the world has to do with what information\n\n00:06:55.958 --> 00:06:57.958\ncomes to you through the network of relations.\n\n00:06:57.958 --> 00:07:00.958\nAnd there\u2019s no place for an omniscient observer\n\n00:07:00.958 --> 00:07:05.958\nor an outside intelligence knowing everything and making everything.\n\n00:07:05.958 --> 00:07:08.958\nSo this is general relativity, this is quantum theory.\n\n00:07:08.958 --> 00:07:11.958\nThis is also, if you talk to legal scholars,\n\n00:07:11.958 --> 00:07:15.958\nthe foundations of new ideas in legal thought.\n\n00:07:15.958 --> 00:07:16.958\nThey\u2019re thinking about the same things.\n\n00:07:16.958 --> 00:07:19.958\nAnd not only that, they make the analogy\n\n00:07:19.958 --> 00:07:22.958\nto relativity theory and cosmology often.\n\n00:07:22.958 --> 00:07:25.958\nSo there\u2019s an interesting discussion going on there.\n\n00:07:25.958 --> 00:07:30.958\nThis last view of cosmology is called the relational view.\n\n00:07:30.958 --> 00:07:33.958\nSo the main slogan here is that there\u2019s nothing outside the universe,\n\n00:07:33.958 --> 00:07:35.958\nwhich means that there\u2019s no place\n\n00:07:35.958 --> 00:07:39.958\nto put an explanation for something outside.\n\n00:07:39.958 --> 00:07:41.958\nSo in such a relational universe,\n\n00:07:41.958 --> 00:07:45.958\nif you come upon something that\u2019s ordered and structured,\n\n00:07:45.958 --> 00:07:47.958\nlike this device here, or that device there,\n\n00:07:47.958 --> 00:07:49.958\nor something beautiful, like all the living things,\n\n00:07:49.958 --> 00:07:52.958\nall of you guys in the room --\n\n00:07:52.958 --> 00:07:57.958\n\"guys\" in physics, by the way, is a generic term: men and women.\n\n00:07:57.958 --> 00:08:00.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:08:00.958 --> 00:08:03.958\nThen you want to know, you\u2019re a person,\n\n00:08:03.958 --> 00:08:05.958\nyou want to know how is it made.\n\n00:08:05.958 --> 00:08:10.958\nAnd in a relational universe the only possible explanation was, somehow it made itself.\n\n00:08:10.958 --> 00:08:13.958\nThere must be mechanisms of self-organization\n\n00:08:13.958 --> 00:08:15.958\ninside the universe that make things.\n\n00:08:15.958 --> 00:08:18.958\nBecause there\u2019s no place to put a maker outside,\n\n00:08:18.958 --> 00:08:22.958\nas there was in the Aristotelian and the Newtonian universe.\n\n00:08:22.958 --> 00:08:26.958\nSo in a relational universe we must have processes of self-organization.\n\n00:08:26.958 --> 00:08:32.958\nNow, Darwin taught us that there are processes of self-organization\n\n00:08:32.958 --> 00:08:36.958\nthat suffice to explain all of us and everything we see.\n\n00:08:36.958 --> 00:08:38.958\nSo it works. But not only that,\n\n00:08:38.958 --> 00:08:42.958\nif you think about how natural selection works,\n\n00:08:42.958 --> 00:08:44.958\nthen it turns out that natural selection\n\n00:08:44.958 --> 00:08:48.958\nwould only make sense in such a relational universe.\n\n00:08:48.958 --> 00:08:52.958\nThat is, natural selection works on properties,\n\n00:08:52.958 --> 00:08:55.958\nlike fitness, which are about relationships\n\n00:08:55.958 --> 00:08:58.958\nof some species to some other species.\n\n00:08:58.958 --> 00:09:02.958\nDarwin wouldn\u2019t make sense in an Aristotelian universe,\n\n00:09:02.958 --> 00:09:06.958\nand wouldn\u2019t really make sense in a Newtonian universe.\n\n00:09:06.958 --> 00:09:11.958\nSo a theory of biology based on natural selection\n\n00:09:11.958 --> 00:09:14.958\nrequires a relational notion of\n\n00:09:14.958 --> 00:09:17.958\nwhat are the properties of biological systems.\n\n00:09:17.958 --> 00:09:20.958\nAnd if you push that all the way down, really,\n\n00:09:20.958 --> 00:09:23.958\nit makes the best sense in a relational universe\n\n00:09:23.958 --> 00:09:26.958\nwhere all properties are relational.\n\n00:09:26.958 --> 00:09:29.958\nNow, not only that, but Einstein taught us\n\n00:09:29.958 --> 00:09:35.958\nthat gravity is the result of the world being relational.\n\n00:09:35.958 --> 00:09:38.958\nIf it wasn\u2019t for gravity, there wouldn\u2019t be life,\n\n00:09:38.958 --> 00:09:44.958\nbecause gravity causes stars to form and live for a very long time,\n\n00:09:44.958 --> 00:09:47.958\nkeeping pieces of the world, like the surface of the Earth,\n\n00:09:47.958 --> 00:09:51.958\nout of thermal equilibrium for billions of years so life can evolve.\n\n00:09:51.958 --> 00:09:53.958\nIn the 20th century,\n\n00:09:53.958 --> 00:09:58.958\nwe saw the independent development of two big themes in science.\n\n00:09:58.958 --> 00:10:02.958\nIn the biological sciences, they explored\n\n00:10:02.958 --> 00:10:05.958\nthe implications of the notion that order and complexity\n\n00:10:05.958 --> 00:10:09.958\nand structure arise in a self-organized way.\n\n00:10:09.958 --> 00:10:13.958\nThat was the triumph of Neo-Darwinism and so forth.\n\n00:10:13.958 --> 00:10:18.958\nAnd slowly, that idea is leaking out to the cognitive sciences,\n\n00:10:18.958 --> 00:10:22.958\nthe human sciences, economics, et cetera.\n\n00:10:22.958 --> 00:10:24.958\nAt the same time, we physicists\n\n00:10:24.958 --> 00:10:27.958\nhave been busy trying to make sense of\n\n00:10:27.958 --> 00:10:30.958\nand build on and integrate the discoveries\n\n00:10:30.958 --> 00:10:32.958\nof quantum theory and relativity.\n\n00:10:32.958 --> 00:10:36.958\nAnd what we\u2019ve been working out is the implications, really,\n\n00:10:36.958 --> 00:10:39.958\nof the idea that the universe is made up of relations.\n\n00:10:39.958 --> 00:10:42.958\n21st-century science is going to be driven\n\n00:10:42.958 --> 00:10:45.958\nby the integration of these two ideas:\n\n00:10:45.958 --> 00:10:48.958\nthe triumph of relational ways of thinking\n\n00:10:48.958 --> 00:10:50.958\nabout the world, on the one hand,\n\n00:10:50.958 --> 00:10:53.958\nand self-organization or Darwinian ways of thinking about the world,\n\n00:10:53.958 --> 00:10:56.958\non the other hand.\n\n00:10:56.958 --> 00:10:58.958\nAnd also, is that in the 21st century\n\n00:10:58.958 --> 00:11:03.958\nour thinking about space and time and cosmology,\n\n00:11:03.958 --> 00:11:08.958\nand our thinking about society are both going to continue to evolve.\n\n00:11:08.958 --> 00:11:10.958\nAnd what they\u2019re evolving towards is the union\n\n00:11:10.958 --> 00:11:14.958\nof these two big ideas, Darwinism and relationalism.\n\n00:11:14.958 --> 00:11:20.958\nNow, if you think about democracy from this perspective,\n\n00:11:20.958 --> 00:11:25.958\na new pluralistic notion of democracy would be one that recognizes\n\n00:11:25.958 --> 00:11:28.958\nthat there are many different interests, many different agendas,\n\n00:11:28.958 --> 00:11:32.958\nmany different individuals, many different points of view.\n\n00:11:32.958 --> 00:11:36.958\nEach one is incomplete, because you\u2019re embedded\n\n00:11:36.958 --> 00:11:38.958\nin a network of relationships.\n\n00:11:38.958 --> 00:11:40.958\nAny actor in a democracy is embedded\n\n00:11:40.958 --> 00:11:41.958\nin a network of relationships.\n\n00:11:41.958 --> 00:11:44.958\nAnd you understand some things better than other things,\n\n00:11:44.958 --> 00:11:48.958\nand because of that there\u2019s a continual jostling\n\n00:11:48.958 --> 00:11:53.958\nand give and take, which is politics.\n\n00:11:53.958 -->

And I'd like to start by sharing with you one moment that to me sums up what there is to know about American and democratic responses to mass atrocity.And that moment came on April 21, 1994. So 14 years ago, almost, in the middle of the Rwandan genocide, in which 800,000 people would be systematically exterminated by the Rwandan government and some extremist militia. On April 21, in the New York Times, the paper reported that somewhere between 200,000 and 300,000 people had already been killed in the genocide. It was in the paper \u2014 not on the front page. It was a lot like the Holocaust coverage, it was buried in the paper. Rwanda itself was not seen as newsworthy, and amazingly, genocide itself was not seen as newsworthy.But on April 21, a wonderfully honest moment occurred. And that was that an American congresswoman named Patricia Schroeder from Colorado met with a group of journalists. And one of the journalists said to her, what's up? What's going on in the U.S. government? Two to 300,000 people have just been exterminated in the last couple of weeks in Rwanda. It's two weeks into the genocide at that time, but of course, at that time you don't know how long it's going to last. And the journalist said, why is there so little response out of Washington? Why no hearings, no denunciations, no people getting arrested in front of the Rwandan embassy or in front of the White House? What's the deal? And she said \u2014 she was so honest \u2014 she said, \"It's a great question. All I can tell you is that in my congressional office in Colorado and my office in Washington, we're getting hundreds and hundreds of calls about the endangered ape and gorilla population in Rwanda, but nobody is calling about the people. The phones just aren't ringing about the people.\"And the reason I give you this moment is there's a deep truth in it. And that truth is, or was, in the 20th century, that while we were beginning to develop endangered species movements, we didn't have an endangered people's movement. We had Holocaust education in the schools. Most of us were groomed not only on images of nuclear catastrophe, but also on images and knowledge of the Holocaust. There's a museum, of course, on the Mall in Washington, right next to Lincoln and Jefferson. I mean, we have owned Never Again culturally, appropriately, interestingly. And yet the politicization of Never Again, the operationalization of Never Again, had never occurred in the 20th century.And that's what that moment with Patricia Schroeder I think shows: that if we are to bring about an end to the world's worst atrocities, we have to make it such. There has to be a role \u2014 there has to be the creation of political noise and political costs in response to massive crimes against humanity, and so forth. So that was the 20th century.Now here \u2014 and this will be a relief to you at this point in the afternoon \u2014 there is good news, amazing news, in the 21st century, and that is that, almost out of nowhere, there has come into being an anti-genocide movement, an anti-genocide constituency, and one that looks destined, in fact, to be permanent. It grew up in response to the atrocities in Darfur. It is comprised of students. There are something like 300 anti-genocide chapters on college campuses around the country. It's bigger than the anti-apartheid movement. There are something like 500 high school chapters devoted to stopping the genocide in Darfur. Evangelicals have joined it. Jewish groups have joined it. \"Hotel Rwanda\" watchers have joined it. It is a cacophonous movement.To call it a movement, as with all movements, perhaps, is a little misleading. It's diverse. It's got a lot of different approaches. It's got all the ups and the downs of movements. But it has been amazingly successful in one regard, in that it has become, it has congealed into this endangered people's movement that was missing in the 20th century. It sees itself, such as it is, the it, as something that will create the impression that there will be political cost, there will be a political price to be paid, for allowing genocide, for not having an heroic imagination, for not being an upstander but for being, in fact, a bystander.Now because it's student-driven, there's some amazing things that the movement has done. They have launched a divestment campaign that has now convinced, I think, 55 universities in 22 states to divest their holdings of stocks with regard to companies doing business in Sudan. They have a 1-800-GENOCIDE number \u2014 this is going to sound very kitsch, but for those of you who may not be, I mean, may be apolitical, but interested in doing something about genocide, you dial 1-800-GENOCIDE and you type in your zip code, and you don't even have to know who your congressperson is. It will refer you directly to your congressperson, to your U.S. senator, to your governor where divestment legislation is pending. They've lowered the transaction costs of stopping genocide. I think the most innovative thing they've introduced recently are genocide grades. And it takes students to introduce genocide grades. So what you now have when a Congress is in session is members of Congress calling up these 19-year-olds or 24-year-olds and saying, I'm just told I have a D minus on genocide; what do I do to get a C? I just want to get a C. Help me. And the students and the others who are part of this incredibly energized base are there to answer that, and there's always something to do.Now, what this movement has done is it has extracted from the Bush administration from the United States, at a time of massive over-stretch \u2014 military, financial, diplomatic \u2014 a whole series of commitments to Darfur that no other country in the world is making. For instance, the referral of the crimes in Darfur to the International Criminal Court, which the Bush administration doesn't like. The expenditure of 3 billion dollars in refugee camps to try to keep, basically, the people who've been displaced from their homes by the Sudanese government, by the so-called Janjaweed, the militia, to keep those people alive until something more durable can be achieved. And recently, or now not that recently, about six months ago, the authorization of a peacekeeping force of 26,000 that will go.And that's all the Bush administration's leadership, and it's all because of this bottom-up pressure and the fact that the phones haven't stopped ringing from the beginning of this crisis. The bad news, however, to this question of will evil prevail, is that evil lives on. The people in those camps are surrounded on all sides by so-called Janjaweed, these men on horseback with spears and Kalashnikovs. Women who go to get firewood in order to heat the humanitarian aid in order to feed their families \u2014 humanitarian aid, the dirty secret of it is it has to be heated, really, to be edible \u2014 are themselves subjected to rape, which is a tool of the genocide that is being used. And the peacekeepers I've mentioned, the force has been authorized, but almost no country on Earth has stepped forward since the authorization to actually put its troops or its police in harm's way.So we have achieved an awful lot relative to the 20th century, and yet far too little relative to the gravity of the crime that is unfolding as we sit here, as we speak. Why the limits to the movement? Why is what has been achieved, or what the movement has done, been necessary but not sufficient to the crime? I think there are a couple \u2014 there are many reasons \u2014 but a couple just to focus on briefly.The first is that the movement, such as it is, stops at America's borders.  It is not a global movement. It does not have too many compatriots abroad who themselves are asking their governments to do more to stop genocide. And the Holocaust culture that we have in this country makes Americans, sort of, more prone to, I think, want to bring Never Again to life. The guilt that the Clinton administration expressed, that Bill Clinton expressed over Rwanda, created a space in our society for a consensus that Rwanda was bad and wrong and we wish we had done more, and that is something that the movement has taken advantage of. European governments, for the most part, haven't acknowledged responsibility, and there's nothing to kind of to push back and up against.So this movement, if it's to be durable and global, will have to cross borders, and you will have to see other citizens in democracies, not simply resting on the assumption that their government would do something in the face of genocide, but actually making it such. Governments will never gravitate towards crimes of this magnitude naturally or eagerly. As we saw, they haven't even gravitated towards protecting our ports or reigning in loose nukes. Why would we expect in a bureaucracy that it would orient itself towards distant suffering? So one reason is it hasn't gone global.The second is, of course, that at this time in particular in America's history, we have a credibility problem, a legitimacy problem in international institutions. It is structurally really, really hard to do, as the Bush administration rightly does, which is to denounce genocide on a Monday and then describe water boarding on a Tuesday as a no-brainer and then turn up on Wednesday and look for troop commitments. Now, other countries have their own reasons for not wanting to get involved. Let me be clear. They're in some ways using the Bush administration as an alibi. But it is essential for us to be a leader in this sphere, of course to restore our standing and our leadership in the world. The recovery's going to take some time.We have to ask ourselves, what now? What do we do going forward as a country and as citizens in relationship to the world's worst places, the world's worst suffering, killers, and the kinds of killers that could come home to roost sometime in the future? The place that I turned to answer that question was to a man that many of you may not have ever heard of, and that is a Brazilian named Sergio Vieira de Mello who, as Chris said, was blown up in Iraq in 2003. He was the victim of the first-ever suicide bomb in Iraq. It's hard to remember, but there was actually a time in the summer of 2003, even after the U.S. invasion, where, apart from looting, civilians were relatively safe in Iraq.Now, who was Sergio? Sergio Vieira de Mello was his name. In addition to being Brazilian, he was described to me before I met him in 1994 as someone who was a cross between James Bond on the one hand and Bobby Kennedy on the other. And in the U.N., you don't get that many people who actually manage to merge those qualities. He was James Bond-like in that he was ingenious. He was drawn to the flames, he chased the flames, he was like a moth to the flames. Something of an adrenalin junkie. He was successful with women. He was Bobby Kennedy-like because in some ways one could never tell if he was a realist masquerading as an idealist or an idealist masquerading as a realist, as people always wondered about Bobby Kennedy and John Kennedy in that way.What he was was a decathlete of nation-building, of problem-solving, of troubleshooting in the world's worst places and in the world's most broken places. In failing states, genocidal states, under-governed states, precisely the kinds of places that threats to this country exist on the horizon, and precisely the kinds of places where most of the world's suffering tends to get concentrated. These are the places he was drawn to. He moved with the headlines. He was in the U.N. for 34 years. He joined at the age of 21. Started off when the causes in the wars du jour in the '70s were wars of independence and decolonization. He was there in Bangladesh dealing with the outflow of millions of refugees \u2014 the largest refugee flow in history up to that point. He was in Sudan when the civil war broke out there. He was in Cyprus right after the Turkish invasion. He was in Mozambique for the War of Independence. He was in Lebanon. Amazingly, he was in Lebanon \u2014 the U.N. base was used \u2014 Palestinians staged attacks out from behind the U.N. base. Israel then invaded and overran the U.N. base.Sergio was in Beirut when the U.S. Embassy was hit by the first-ever suicide attack against the United States. People date the beginning of this new era to 9/11, but surely 1983, with the attack on the US Embassy and the Marine barracks \u2014 which Sergio witnessed \u2014 those are, in fact, in some ways, the dawning of the era that we find ourselves in today. From Lebanon he went to Bosnia in the '90s. The issues were, of course, ethnic sectarian violence. He was the first person to negotiate with the Khmer Rouge. Talk about evil prevailing. I mean, here he was in the room with the embodiment of evil in Cambodia. He negotiates with the Serbs. He actually crosses so far into this realm of talking to evil and trying to convince evil that it doesn't need to prevail that he earns the nickname \u2014 not Sergio but Serbio while he's living in the Balkans and conducting these kinds of negotiations.He then goes to Rwanda and to Congo in the aftermath of the genocide, and he's the guy who has to decide \u2014 huh, OK, the genocide is over; 800,000 people have been killed; the people responsible are fleeing into neighboring countries \u2014 into Congo, into Tanzania. I'm Sergio, I'm a humanitarian, and I want to feed those \u2014 well, I don't want to feed the killers but I want to feed the two million people who are with them, so we're going to go, we're going to set up camps, and we're going to supply humanitarian aid. But, uh-oh, the killers are within the camps. Well, I'd like to separate the sheep from the wolves. Let me go door-to-door to the international community and see if anybody will give me police or troops to do the separation. And their response, of course, was no more than we wanted to stop the genocide and put our troops in harm's way to do that, nor do we now want to get in the way and pluck genocidaires from camps.So then you have to make the decision. Do you turn off the international spigot of life support and risk two million civilian lives? Or do you continue feeding the civilians, knowing that the genocidaires are in the camps, literally sharpening their knives for future battle? What do you do? It's all lesser-evil terrain in these broken places.Late '90s: nation-building is the cause du jour. He's the guy put in charge. He's the Paul Bremer or the Jerry Bremer of first Kosovo and then East Timor. He governs the places. He's the viceroy. He has to decide on tax policy, on currency, on border patrol, on policing. He has to make all these judgments. He's a Brazilian in these places. He speaks seven languages. He's been up to that point in 14 war zones so he's positioned to make better judgments, perhaps, than people who have never done that kind of work. But nonetheless, he is the cutting edge of our experimentation with doing good with very few resources being brought to bear in, again, the world's worst places.And then after Timor, 9/11 has happened, he's named U.N. Human Rights Commissioner, and he has to balance liberty and security and figure out, what do you do when the most powerful country in the United Nations is bowing out of the Geneva Conventions, bowing out of international law? Do you denounce? Well, if you denounce, you're probably never going to get back in the room. Maybe you stay reticent. Maybe you try to charm President Bush \u2014 and that's what he did. And in so doing he earned himself, unfortunately, his final and tragic appointment to Iraq \u2014 the one that resulted in his death.One note on his death, which is so devastating, is that despite predicating the war on Iraq on a link between Saddam Hussein and terrorism in 9/11, believe it or not, the Bush administration or the invaders did no planning, no pre-war planning, to respond to terrorism. So Sergio \u2014 this receptacle of all of this learning on how to deal with evil and how to deal with brokenness, lay under the rubble for three and a half hours without rescue. Stateless. The guy who tried to help the stateless people his whole career. Like a refugee. Because he represents the U.N.If you represent everyone, in some ways you represent no one. You're un-owned. And what the American \u2014 the most powerful military in the history of mankind was able to muster for his rescue, believe it or not, was literally these heroic two American soldiers went into the shaft. Building was shaking. One of them had been at 9/11 and lost his buddies on September 11th, and yet went in and risked his life in order to save Sergio. But all they had was a woman's handbag \u2014 literally one of those basket handbags \u2014 and they tied it to a curtain rope from one of the offices at U.N. headquarters, and created a pulley system into this shaft in this quivering building in the interests of rescuing this person, the person we most need to turn to now, this shepherd, at a time when so many of us feel like we're lacking guidance.And this was the pulley system. This was what we were able to muster for Sergio. The good news, for what it's worth, is after Sergio and 21 others were killed that day in the attack on the U.N., the military created a search and rescue unit that had the cutting equipment, the shoring wood, the cranes, the things that you would have needed to do the rescue. But it was too late for Sergio.I want to wrap up, but I want to close with what I take to be the four lessons from Sergio's life on this question of how do we prevent evil from prevailing, which is how I would have framed the question. Here's this guy who got a 34-year head start thinking about the kinds of questions we as a country are grappling with, we as citizens are grappling with now. What do we take away?First, I think, is his relationship to, in fact, evil is something to learn from. He, over the course of his career, changed a great deal. He had a lot of flaws, but he was very adaptive. I think that was his greatest quality. He started as somebody who would denounce harmdoers, he would charge up to people who were violating international law, and he would say, you're violating, this is the U.N. Charter. Don't you see it's unacceptable what you're doing? And they would laugh at him because he didn't have the power of states, the power of any military or police. He just had the rules, he had the norms, and he tried to use them. And in Lebanon, Southern Lebanon in '82, he said to himself and to everybody else, I will never use the word \"unacceptable\" again. I will never use it. I will try to make it such, but I will never use that word again. But he lunged in the opposite direction. He started, as I mentioned, to get in the room with evil, to not denounce, and became almost obsequious when he won the nickname Serbio, for instance, and even when he negotiated with the Khmer Rouge would black-box what had occurred prior to entering the room.But by the end of his life, I think he had struck a balance that we as a country can learn from. Be in the room, don't be afraid of talking to your adversaries, but don't bracket what happened before you entered the room. Don't black-box history. Don't check your principles at the door. And I think that's something that we have to be in the room, whether it's Nixon going to China or Khrushchev and Kennedy or Reagan and Gorbachev. All the great progress in this country with relation to our adversaries has come by going into the room. And it doesn't have to be an act of weakness. You can actually do far more to build an international coalition against a harmdoer or a wrongdoer by being in the room and showing to the rest of the world that that person, that regime, is the problem and that you, the United States, are not the problem.Second take-away from Sergio's life, briefly. What I take away, and this in some ways is the most important, he espoused and exhibited a reverence for dignity that was really, really unusual. At a micro level, the individuals around him were visible. He saw them. At a macro level, he thought, you know, we talk about democracy promotion, but we do it in a way sometimes that's an affront to people's dignity. We put people on humanitarian aid and we boast about it because we've spent three billion. It's incredibly important, those people would no longer be alive if the United States, for instance, hadn't spent that money in Darfur, but it's not a way to live. If we think about dignity in our conduct as citizens and as individuals with relation to the people around us, and as a country, if we could inject a regard for dignity into our dealings with other countries, it would be something of a revolution.Third point, very briefly. He talked a lot about freedom from fear. And I recognize there is so much to be afraid of. There are so many genuine threats in the world. But what Sergio was talking about is, let's calibrate our relationship to the threat. Let's not hype the threat; let's actually see it clearly. We have reason to be afraid of melting ice caps. We have reason to be afraid that we haven't secured loose nuclear material in the former Soviet Union. Let's focus on what are the legitimate challenges and threats, but not lunge into bad decisions because of a panic, of a fear. In times of fear, for instance, one of the things Sergio used to say is, fear is a bad advisor. We lunge towards the extremes when we aren't operating and trying to, again, calibrate our relationship to the world around us.Fourth and final point: he somehow, because he was working in all the world's worst places and all lesser evils, had a humility, of course, and an awareness of the complexity of the world around him. I mean, such an acute awareness of how hard it was. How Sisyphean this task was of mending, and yet aware of that complexity, humbled by it, he wasn't paralyzed by it. And we as citizens, as we go through this experience of the kind of, the crisis of confidence, crisis of competence, crisis of legitimacy, I think there's a temptation to pull back from the world and say, ah, Katrina, Iraq \u2014 we don't know what we're doing. We can't afford to pull back from the world. It's a question of how to be in the world.And the lesson, I think, of the anti-genocide movement that I mentioned, that is a partial success but by no means has it achieved what it has set out to do \u2014 it'll be many decades, probably, before that happens \u2014 but is that if we want to see change, we have to become the change. We can't rely upon our institutions to do the work of necessarily talking to adversaries on their own without us creating a space for that to happen, for having respect for dignity, and for bringing that combination of humility and a sort of emboldened sense of responsibility to our dealings with the rest of the world. So will evil prevail? Is that the question? I think the short answer is: no, not unless we let it.Thank you.

What's the deal?\n\n00:01:56.958 --> 00:02:01.958\nAnd she said -- she was so honest -- she said, \"It's a great question.\n\n00:02:01.958 --> 00:02:05.958\nAll I can tell you is that in my congressional office in Colorado\n\n00:02:05.958 --> 00:02:07.958\nand my office in Washington,\n\n00:02:07.958 --> 00:02:10.958\nwe're getting hundreds and hundreds of calls\n\n00:02:10.958 --> 00:02:15.958\nabout the endangered ape and gorilla population in Rwanda,\n\n00:02:15.958 --> 00:02:18.958\nbut nobody is calling about the people.\n\n00:02:18.958 --> 00:02:21.958\nThe phones just aren't ringing about the people.\"\n\n00:02:21.958 --> 00:02:26.958\nAnd the reason I give you this moment is there's a deep truth in it.\n\n00:02:26.958 --> 00:02:30.958\nAnd that truth is, or was, in the 20th century,\n\n00:02:30.958 --> 00:02:35.958\nthat while we were beginning to develop endangered species movements, \n\n\n00:02:35.958 --> 00:02:37.958\nwe didn't have an endangered people's movement.\n\n00:02:37.958 --> 00:02:41.958\nWe had Holocaust education in the schools.\n\n00:02:41.958 --> 00:02:45.958\nMost of us were groomed not only on images of nuclear catastrophe,\n\n00:02:45.958 --> 00:02:49.958\nbut also on images and knowledge of the Holocaust.\n\n00:02:50.958 --> 00:02:53.958\nThere's a museum, of course, on the Mall in Washington,\n\n00:02:53.958 --> 00:02:55.958\nright next to Lincoln and Jefferson.\n\n00:02:55.958 --> 00:02:59.958\nI mean, we have owned Never Again culturally,\n\n00:02:59.958 --> 00:03:03.958\nappropriately, interestingly.\n\n00:03:03.958 --> 00:03:07.958\nAnd yet the politicization of Never Again,\n\n00:03:07.958 --> 00:03:09.958\nthe operationalization of Never Again,\n\n00:03:09.958 --> 00:03:12.958\nhad never occurred in the 20th century.\n\n00:03:12.958 --> 00:03:15.958\nAnd that's what that moment with Patricia Schroeder I think shows:\n\n00:03:15.958 --> 00:03:22.958\nthat if we are to bring about an end to the world's worst atrocities,\n\n00:03:22.958 --> 00:03:24.958\nwe have to make it such.\n\n00:03:24.958 --> 00:03:26.958\nThere has to be a role --\n\n00:03:26.958 --> 00:03:29.958\nthere has to be the creation of political noise and political costs\n\n00:03:29.958 --> 00:03:32.958\nin response to massive crimes against humanity, and so forth.\n\n00:03:32.958 --> 00:03:34.958\nSo that was the 20th century.\n\n00:03:34.958 --> 00:03:38.958\nNow here -- and this will be a relief to you at this point in the afternoon --\n\n00:03:38.958 --> 00:03:42.958\nthere is good news, amazing news, in the 21st century,\n\n00:03:42.958 --> 00:03:49.958\nand that is that, almost out of nowhere, there has come into being\n\n00:03:49.958 --> 00:03:52.958\nan anti-genocide movement, an anti-genocide constituency,\n\n00:03:52.958 --> 00:03:56.958\nand one that looks destined, in fact, to be permanent.\n\n00:03:56.958 --> 00:03:59.958\nIt grew up in response to the atrocities in Darfur.\n\n00:03:59.958 --> 00:04:05.958\nIt is comprised of students. There are something like 300 anti-genocide chapters\n\n00:04:05.958 --> 00:04:08.958\non college campuses around the country.\n\n00:04:08.958 --> 00:04:10.958\nIt's bigger than the anti-apartheid movement.\n\n00:04:10.958 --> 00:04:14.958\nThere are something like 500 high school chapters\n\n00:04:14.958 --> 00:04:17.958\ndevoted to stopping the genocide in Darfur.\n\n00:04:17.958 --> 00:04:21.958\nEvangelicals have joined it. Jewish groups have joined it.\n\n00:04:21.958 --> 00:04:25.958\n\"Hotel Rwanda\" watchers have joined it. It is a cacophonous movement.\n\n00:04:25.958 --> 00:04:28.958\nTo call it a movement, as with all movements, perhaps, is a little misleading.\n\n00:04:28.958 --> 00:04:31.958\nIt's diverse. It's got a lot of different approaches.\n\n00:04:31.958 --> 00:04:33.958\nIt's got all the ups and the downs of movements.\n\n00:04:33.958 --> 00:04:37.958\nBut it has been amazingly successful in one regard,\n\n00:04:37.958 --> 00:04:39.958\nin that it has become,\n\n00:04:39.958 --> 00:04:42.958\nit has congealed into this endangered people's movement\n\n00:04:42.958 --> 00:04:44.958\nthat was missing in the 20th century.\n\n00:04:44.958 --> 00:04:47.958\nIt sees itself, such as it is, the it,\n\n00:04:47.958 --> 00:04:52.958\nas something that will create the impression that there will be political cost,\n\n00:04:52.958 --> 00:04:55.958\nthere will be a political price to be paid,\n\n00:04:55.958 --> 00:04:59.958\nfor allowing genocide, for not having an heroic imagination,\n\n00:04:59.958 --> 00:05:03.958\nfor not being an upstander but for being, in fact, a bystander.\n\n00:05:03.958 --> 00:05:07.958\nNow because it's student-driven,\n\n00:05:07.958 --> 00:05:09.958\nthere's some amazing things that the movement has done.\n\n00:05:09.958 --> 00:05:11.958\nThey have launched a divestment campaign\n\n00:05:11.958 --> 00:05:15.958\nthat has now convinced, I think, 55 universities in 22 states\n\n00:05:15.958 --> 00:05:17.958\nto divest their holdings of stocks\n\n00:05:17.958 --> 00:05:21.958\nwith regard to companies doing business in Sudan.\n\n00:05:21.958 --> 00:05:23.958\nThey have a 1-800-GENOCIDE number --\n\n00:05:23.958 --> 00:05:25.958\nthis is going to sound very kitsch,\n\n00:05:25.958 --> 00:05:29.958\nbut for those of you who may not be, I mean, may be apolitical,\n\n00:05:29.958 --> 00:05:31.958\nbut interested in doing something about genocide,\n\n00:05:31.958 --> 00:05:34.958\nyou dial 1-800-GENOCIDE and you type in your zip code,\n\n00:05:34.958 --> 00:05:36.958\nand you don't even have to know who your congressperson is.\n\n00:05:36.958 --> 00:05:40.958\nIt will refer you directly to your congressperson, to your U.S. senator,\n\n00:05:40.958 --> 00:05:43.958\nto your governor where divestment legislation is pending.\n\n00:05:43.958 --> 00:05:47.958\nThey've lowered the transaction costs of stopping genocide.\n\n00:05:47.958 --> 00:05:50.958\nI think the most innovative thing they've introduced recently\n\n00:05:50.958 --> 00:05:53.958\nare genocide grades.\n\n00:05:53.958 --> 00:05:56.958\nAnd it takes students to introduce genocide grades.\n\n00:05:56.958 --> 00:05:59.958\nSo what you now have when a Congress is in session\n\n00:05:59.958 --> 00:06:04.958\nis members of Congress calling up these 19-year-olds or 24-year-olds\n\n00:06:04.958 --> 00:06:07.958\nand saying, I'm just told I have a D minus on genocide;\n\n00:06:07.958 --> 00:06:11.958\nwhat do I do to get a C? I just want to get a C. Help me.\n\n00:06:11.958 --> 00:06:13.958\nAnd the students and the others\n\n00:06:13.958 --> 00:06:15.958\nwho are part of this incredibly energized base\n\n00:06:15.958 --> 00:06:19.958\nare there to answer that, and there's always something to do.\n\n00:06:19.958 --> 00:06:24.958\nNow, what this movement has done is it has extracted from the Bush administration\n\n00:06:24.958 --> 00:06:26.958\nfrom the United States,\n\n00:06:26.958 --> 00:06:31.958\nat a time of massive over-stretch -- military, financial, diplomatic --\n\n00:06:31.958 --> 00:06:33.958\na whole series of commitments to Darfur\n\n00:06:33.958 --> 00:06:36.958\nthat no other country in the world is making.\n\n00:06:36.958 --> 00:06:38.958\nFor instance, the referral of the crimes in Darfur\n\n00:06:38.958 --> 00:06:40.958\nto the International Criminal Court,\n\n00:06:40.958 --> 00:06:42.958\nwhich the Bush administration doesn't like.\n\n00:06:42.958 --> 00:06:46.958\nThe expenditure of 3 billion dollars in refugee camps to try to keep,\n\n00:06:46.958 --> 00:06:48.958\nbasically, the people who've been displaced from their homes\n\n00:06:48.958 --> 00:06:51.958\nby the Sudanese government, by the so-called Janjaweed, the militia,\n\n00:06:51.958 --> 00:06:53.958\nto keep those people alive\n\n00:06:53.958 --> 00:06:57.958\nuntil something more durable can be achieved.\n\n00:06:57.958 --> 00:06:59.958\nAnd recently, or now not that recently,\n\n00:06:59.958 --> 00:07:02.958\nabout six months ago, the authorization of a peacekeeping force\n\n00:07:02.958 --> 00:07:04.958\nof 26,000 that will go.\n\n00:07:04.958 --> 00:07:06.958\nAnd that's all the Bush administration's leadership,\n\n00:07:06.958 --> 00:07:08.958\nand it's all because of this bottom-up pressure\n\n00:07:08.958 --> 00:07:11.958\nand the fact that the phones haven't stopped ringing\n\n00:07:11.958 --> 00:07:13.958\nfrom the beginning of this crisis.\n\n00:07:13.958 --> 00:07:16.958\nThe bad news, however, to this question of will evil prevail,\n\n00:07:16.958 --> 00:07:18.958\nis that evil lives on.\n\n00:07:18.958 --> 00:07:22.958\nThe people in those camps are surrounded on all sides\n\n00:07:22.958 --> 00:07:24.958\nby so-called Janjaweed, these men on horseback\n\n00:07:24.958 --> 00:07:26.958\nwith spears and Kalashnikovs.\n\n00:07:26.958 --> 00:07:30.958\nWomen who go to get firewood in order to heat the humanitarian aid\n\n00:07:30.958 --> 00:07:33.958\nin order to feed their families -- humanitarian aid,\n\n00:07:33.958 --> 00:07:36.958\nthe dirty secret of it is it has to be heated, really, to be edible --\n\n00:07:36.958 --> 00:07:38.958\nare themselves subjected to rape,\n\n00:07:38.958 --> 00:07:40.958\nwhich is a tool of the genocide that is being used.\n\n00:07:40.958 --> 00:07:43.958\nAnd the peacekeepers I've mentioned, the force has been authorized,\n\n00:07:43.958 --> 00:07:48.958\nbut almost no country on Earth has stepped forward since the authorization\n\n00:07:48.958 --> 00:07:51.958\nto actually put its troops or its police in harm's way.\n\n00:07:51.958 --> 00:07:56.958\nSo we have achieved an awful lot relative to the 20th century,\n\n00:07:56.958 --> 00:08:00.958\nand yet far too little relative to the gravity of the crime that is unfolding\n\n00:08:00.958 --> 00:08:02.958\nas we sit here, as we speak.\n\n00:08:02.958 --> 00:08:05.958\nWhy the limits to the movement?\n\n00:08:05.958 --> 00:08:09.958\nWhy is what has been achieved, or what the movement has done,\n\n00:08:09.958 --> 00:08:11.958\nbeen necessary but not sufficient to the crime?\n\n00:08:11.958 --> 00:08:13.958\nI think there are a couple -- there are many reasons --\n\n00:08:13.958 --> 00:08:15.958\nbut a couple just to focus on briefly.\n\n00:08:15.958 --> 00:08:19.958\nThe first is that the movement, such as it is,\n\n\n00:08:19.958 --> 00:08:23.958\nstops at America's borders. \nIt is not a global movement. \n\n\n00:08:23.958 --> 00:08:27.958\nIt does not have too many compatriots abroad who themselves\n\n00:08:27.958 --> 00:08:31.958\nare asking their governments to do more to stop genocide.\n\n00:08:31.958 --> 00:08:33.958\nAnd the Holocaust culture that we have in this country\n\n00:08:33.958 --> 00:08:36.958\nmakes Americans, sort of, more prone to, I think,\n\n00:08:36.958 --> 00:08:39.958\nwant to bring Never Again to life.\n\n00:08:39.958 --> 00:08:43.958\nThe guilt that the Clinton administration expressed,\n\n00:08:43.958 --> 00:08:45.958\nthat Bill Clinton expressed over Rwanda,\n\n00:08:45.958 --> 00:08:47.958\ncreated a space in our society for a consensus\n\n00:08:47.958 --> 00:08:49.958\nthat Rwanda was bad and wrong\n\n00:08:49.958 --> 00:08:51.958\nand we wish we had done more, and that is something\n\n00:08:51.958 --> 00:08:53.958\nthat the movement has taken advantage of.\n\n00:08:53.958 --> 00:08:54.958\nEuropean governments, for the most part,\n\n00:08:54.958 --> 00:08:57.958\nhaven't acknowledged responsibility, and there's nothing to kind of\n\n00:08:57.958 --> 00:09:01.958\nto push back and up against.\n\n00:09:01.958 --> 00:09:05.958\nSo this movement, if it's to be durable and global,\n\n00:09:05.958 --> 00:09:08.958\nwill have to cross borders, and you will have to see\n\n00:09:08.958 --> 00:09:12.958\nother citizens in democracies, not simply resting on the assumption\n\n00:09:12.958 --> 00:09:15.958\nthat their government would do something in the face of genocide,\n\n00:09:15.958 --> 00:09:17.958\nbut actually making it such.\n\n00:09:17.958 --> 00:09:20.958\nGovernments will never gravitate towards crimes of this magnitude\n\n00:09:20.958 --> 00:09:22.958\nnaturally or eagerly.\n\n00:09:22.958 --> 00:09:24.958\nAs we saw, they haven't even gravitated towards protecting our ports\n\n00:09:24.958 --> 00:09:26.958\nor reigning in loose nukes.\n\n00:09:26.958 --> 00:09:30.958\nWhy would we expect in a bureaucracy that it would orient itself\n\n00:09:30.958 --> 00:09:32.958\ntowards distant suffering?\n\n00:09:32.958 --> 00:09:34.958\nSo one reason is it hasn't gone global.\n\n00:09:34.958 --> 00:09:38.958\nThe second is, of course, that at this time in particular in America's history,\n\n00:09:38.958 --> 00:09:40.958\nwe have a credibility problem,\n\n00:09:40.958 --> 00:09:42.958\na legitimacy problem in international institutions.\n\n00:09:42.958 --> 00:09:45.958\nIt is structurally really, really hard to do,\n\n00:09:45.958 --> 00:09:47.958\nas the Bush administration rightly does,\n\n00:09:47.958 --> 00:09:51.958\nwhich is to denounce genocide on a Monday\n\n00:09:51.958 --> 00:09:54.958\nand then describe water boarding on a Tuesday as a no-brainer\n\n00:09:54.958 --> 00:09:58.958\nand then turn up on Wednesday and look for troop commitments.\n\n00:09:58.958 --> 00:10:01.958\nNow, other countries have their own reasons for not wanting to get involved.\n\n00:10:01.958 --> 00:10:03.958\nLet me be clear.\n\n00:10:03.958 --> 00:10:06.958\nThey're in some ways using the Bush administration as an alibi.\n\n00:10:06.958 --> 00:10:10.958\nBut it is essential for us to be a leader in this sphere,\n\n00:10:10.958 --> 00:10:14.958\nof course to restore our standing and our leadership in the world.\n\n00:10:14.958 --> 00:10:16.958\nThe recovery's going to take some time.\n\n00:10:16.958 --> 00:10:19.958\nWe have to ask ourselves, what now? What do we do going forward\n\n00:10:19.958 --> 00:10:23.958\nas a country and as citizens in relationship to the world's worst places,\n\n00:10:23.958 --> 00:10:28.958\nthe world's worst suffering, killers, and the kinds of killers\n\n00:10:28.958 --> 00:10:33.958\nthat could come home to roost sometime in the future?\n\n00:10:33.958 --> 00:10:39.958\nThe place that I turned to answer that question was to a man\n\n00:10:39.958 --> 00:10:42.958\nthat many of you may not have ever heard of,\n\n00:10:42.958 --> 00:10:47.958\nand that is a Brazilian named Sergio Vieira de Mello who,\n\n00:10:47.958 --> 00:10:53.958\nas Chris said, was blown up in Iraq in 2003.\n\n00:10:53.958 --> 00:10:56.958\nHe was the victim of the first-ever suicide bomb in Iraq.\n\n00:10:56.958 --> 00:10:59.958\nIt's hard to remember, but there was actually a time in the summer of 2003,\n\n00:10:59.958 --> 00:11:02.958\neven after the U.S. invasion, where,\n\n00:11:02.958 --> 00:11:06.958\napart from looting, civilians were relatively safe in Iraq.\n\n00:11:06.958 --> 00:11:09.958\nNow, who was Sergio? Sergio Vieira de Mello was his name.\n\n00:11:09.958 --> 00:11:12.958\nIn addition to being Brazilian, he was described to me\n\n00:11:12.958 --> 00:11:15.958\nbefore I met him in 1994 as someone who was a cross between\n\n00:11:15.958 --> 00:11:19.958\nJames Bond on the one hand and Bobby Kennedy on the other.\n\n00:11:19.958 --> 00:11:22.958\nAnd in the U.N., you don't get that many people\n\n00:11:22.958 --> 00:11:25.958\nwho actually manage to merge those qualities.\n\n00:11:25.958 --> 00:11:29.958\nHe was James Bond-like in that he was ingenious.\n\n00:11:29.958 --> 00:11:32.958\nHe was drawn to the flames, he chased the flames,\n\n00:11:32.958 --> 00:11:35.958\nhe was like a moth to the flames. Something of an adrenalin junkie.\n\n00:11:35.958 --> 00:11:39.958\nHe was successful with women.\n\n00:11:40.958 --> 00:11:44.958\nHe was Bobby Kennedy-like because in some ways one could never tell\n\n00:11:44.958 --> 00:11:46.958\nif he was a realist masquerading as an idealist\n\n00:11:46.958 --> 00:11:50.958\nor an idealist masquerading as a realist, as people always wondered\n\n00:11:50.958 --> 00:11:53.958\nabout Bobby Kennedy and John Kennedy in that way.\n\n00:11:53.958 --> 00:11:57.958\nWhat he was was a decathlete of nation-building, of problem-solving,\n\n00:11:57.958 --> 00:12:00.958\nof troubleshooting in the world's worst places\n\n00:12:00.958 --> 00:12:03.958\nand in the world's most broken places.\n\n00:12:03.958 --> 00:12:07.958\nIn failing states, genocidal states, under-governed states,\n\n00:12:07.958 --> 00:12:12.958\nprecisely the kinds of places that threats to this country exist\n\n00:12:12.958 --> 00:12:15.958\non the horizon, and precisely the kinds of places\n\n00:12:15.958 --> 00:12:19.958\nwhere most of the world's suffering tends to get concentrated.\n\n00:12:19.958 --> 00:12:21.958\nThese are the places he was drawn to.\n\n00:12:21.958 --> 00:12:23.958\nHe moved with the headlines.\n\n00:12:23.958 --> 00:12:28.958\nHe was in the U.N. for 34 years. He joined at the age of 21.\n\n00:12:28.958 --> 00:12:31.958\nStarted off when the causes in the wars du jour in the '70s\n\n00:12:31.958 --> 00:12:33.958\nwere wars of independence and decolonization.\n\n00:12:33.958 --> 00:12:35.958\nHe was there in Bangladesh\n\n00:12:35.958 --> 00:12:37.958\ndealing with the outflow of millions of refugees --\n\n00:12:37.958 --> 00:12:40.958\nthe largest refugee flow in history up to that point.\n\n00:12:40.958 --> 00:12:43.958\nHe was in Sudan when the civil war broke out there.\n\n00:12:43.958 --> 00:12:46.958\nHe was in Cyprus right after the Turkish invasion.\n\n00:12:46.958 --> 00:12:48.958\nHe was in Mozambique for the War of Independence.\n\n00:12:48.958 --> 00:12:51.958\nHe was in Lebanon. Amazingly, he was in Lebanon -- the U.N. base was used --\n\n00:12:51.958 --> 00:12:55.958\nPalestinians staged attacks out from behind the U.N. base.\n\n00:12:55.958 --> 00:12:58.958\nIsrael then invaded and overran the U.N. base.\n\n00:12:58.958 --> 00:13:00.958\nSergio was in Beirut when the U.S. Embassy was hit\n\n00:13:00.958 --> 00:13:03.958\nby the first-ever suicide attack against the United States. \n\n\n00:13:03.958 --> 00:13:08.958\nPeople date the beginning of this new era to 9/11, but surely 1983,\n\n00:13:08.958 --> 00:13:10.958\nwith the attack on the US Embassy and the Marine barracks --\n\n00:13:10.958 --> 00:13:13.958\nwhich Sergio witnessed -- those are, in fact, in some ways,\n\n00:13:13.958 --> 00:13:17.958\nthe dawning of the era that we find ourselves in today.\n\n00:13:17.958 --> 00:13:20.958\nFrom Lebanon he went to Bosnia in the '90s.\n\n00:13:20.958 --> 00:13:24.958\nThe issues were, of course, ethnic sectarian violence.\n\n00:13:24.958 --> 00:13:27.958\nHe was the first person to negotiate with the Khmer Rouge.\n\n00:13:27.958 --> 00:13:30.958\nTalk about evil prevailing. I mean, here he was in the room\n\n00:13:30.958 --> 00:13:32.958\nwith the embodiment of evil in Cambodia.\n\n00:13:32.958 --> 00:13:34.958\nHe negotiates with the Serbs.\n\n00:13:34.958 --> 00:13:38.958\nHe actually crosses so far into this realm of talking to evil\n\n00:13:38.958 --> 00:13:41.958\nand trying to convince evil that it doesn't need to prevail\n\n00:13:41.958 --> 00:13:44.958\nthat he earns the nickname -- not Sergio but Serbio\n\n00:13:44.958 --> 00:13:49.958\nwhile he's living in the Balkans and conducting these kinds of negotiations.\n\n00:13:49.958 --> 00:13:52.958\nHe then goes to Rwanda and to Congo in the aftermath of the genocide,\n\n00:13:52.958 --> 00:13:55.958\nand he's the guy who has to decide -- huh, OK, the genocide is over;\n\n00:13:55.958 --> 00:13:59.958\n800,000 people have been killed; the people responsible are fleeing\n\n00:13:59.958 --> 00:14:02.958\ninto neighboring countries -- into Congo, into Tanzania.\n\n00:14:02.958 --> 00:14:05.958\nI'm Sergio, I'm a humanitarian, and I want to feed those --\n\n00:14:05.958 --> 00:14:07.958\nwell, I don't want to feed the killers\n\n00:14:07.958 --> 00:14:10.958\nbut I want to feed the two million people who are with them, so we're going to go,\n\n00:14:10.958 --> 00:14:12.958\nwe're going to set up camps,\n\n00:14:12.958 --> 00:14:14.958\nand we're going to supply humanitarian aid.\n\n00:14:14.958 --> 00:14:17.958\nBut, uh-oh, the killers are within the camps.\n\n00:14:17.958 --> 00:14:19.958\nWell, I'd like to separate the sheep from the wolves.\n\n00:14:19.958 --> 00:14:21.958\nLet me go door-to-door to the international community\n\n00:14:21.958 --> 00:14:24.958\nand see if anybody will give me police or troops to do the separation.\n\n00:14:24.958 --> 00:14:27.958\nAnd their response, of course, was no more than we wanted\n\n00:14:27.958 --> 00:14:30.958\nto stop the genocide and put our troops in harm's way to do that,\n\n00:14:30.958 --> 00:14:35.958\nnor do we now want to get in the way and pluck genocidaires from camps.\n\n00:14:35.958 --> 00:14:37.958\nSo then you have to make the decision.\n\n00:14:37.958 --> 00:14:39.958\nDo you turn off the international spigot of life support\n\n00:14:39.958 --> 00:14:43.958\nand risk two million civilian lives?\n\n00:14:43.958 --> 00:14:46.958\nOr do you continue feeding the civilians, knowing that the genocidaires\n\n00:14:46.958 --> 00:14:50.958\nare in the camps, literally sharpening their knives for future battle?\n\n00:14:50.958 --> 00:14:51.958\nWhat do you do?\n\n00:14:51.958 --> 00:14:54.958\nIt's all lesser-evil terrain in these broken places.\n\n00:14:54.958 --> 00:14:57.958\nLate '90s: nation-building is the cause du jour.\n\n00:14:57.958 --> 00:15:01.958\nHe's the guy put in charge. He's the Paul Bremer or the Jerry Bremer\n\n00:15:01.958 --> 00:15:04.958\nof first Kosovo and then East Timor. He governs the places.\n\n00:15:04.958 --> 00:15:08.958\nHe's the viceroy. He has to decide on tax policy, on currency,\n\n00:15:08.958 --> 00:15:12.958\non border patrol, on policing. He has to make all these judgments.\n\n00:15:12.958 --> 00:15:15.958\nHe's a Brazilian in these places. He speaks seven languages.\n\n00:15:15.958 --> 00:15:17.958\nHe's been up to that point in 14 war zones\n\n00:15:17.958 --> 00:15:20.958\nso he's positioned to make better judgments, perhaps,\n\n00:15:20.958 --> 00:15:22.958\nthan people who have never done that kind of work.\n\n00:15:22.958 --> 00:15:26.958\nBut nonetheless, he is the cutting edge of our experimentation\n\n00:15:26.958 --> 00:15:29.958\nwith doing good with very few resources being brought to bear in,\n\n00:15:29.958 --> 00:15:31.958\nagain, the world's worst places.\n\n00:15:31.958 --> 00:15:34.958\nAnd then after Timor, 9/11 has happened,\n\n00:15:34.958 --> 00:15:36.958\nhe's named U.N. Human Rights Commissioner,\n\n00:15:36.958 --> 00:15:39.958\nand he has to balance liberty and security and figure out,\n\n00:15:39.958 --> 00:15:42.958\nwhat do you do when the most powerful country in the United Nations\n\n00:15:42.958 --> 00:15:45.958\nis bowing out of the Geneva Conventions,\n\n00:15:45.958 --> 00:15:47.958\nbowing out of international law? Do you denounce?\n\n00:15:47.958 --> 00:15:48.958\nWell, if you denounce,\n\n00:15:48.958 --> 00:15:50.958\nyou're probably never going to get back in the room.\n\n00:15:50.958 --> 00:15:55.958\nMaybe you stay reticent. Maybe you try to charm President Bush --\n\n00:15:55.958 --> 00:15:58.958\nand that's what he did. And in so doing he earned himself,\n\n00:15:58.958 --> 00:16:01.958\nunfortunately, his final and tragic appointment to Iraq --\n\n00:16:01.958 --> 00:16:03.958\nthe one that resulted in his death.\n\n00:16:03.958 --> 00:16:06.958\nOne note on his death, which is so devastating,\n\n00:16:06.958 --> 00:16:08.958\nis that despite predicating the war on Iraq\n\n00:16:08.958 --> 00:16:13.958\non a link between Saddam Hussein and terrorism in 9/11,\n\n00:16:13.958 --> 00:16:16.958\nbelieve it or not, the Bush administration or the invaders\n\n00:16:16.958 --> 00:16:20.958\ndid no planning, no pre-war planning, to respond to terrorism.\n\n00:16:20.958 --> 00:16:24.958\nSo Sergio -- this receptacle of all of this learning on how to deal with evil\n\n00:16:24.958 --> 00:16:26.958\nand how to deal with brokenness,\n\n00:16:26.958 --> 00:16:30.958\nlay under the rubble for three and a half hours without rescue.\n\n00:16:30.958 --> 00:16:34.958\nStateless. The guy who tried to help the stateless people his whole career.\n\n00:16:34.958 --> 00:16:36.958\nLike a refugee. Because he represents the U.N.\n\n00:16:36.958 --> 00:16:39.958\nIf you represent everyone, in some ways you represent no one.\n\n00:16:39.958 --> 00:16:41.958\nYou're un-owned.\n\n00:16:41.958 --> 00:16:44.958\nAnd what the American -- the most powerful military in the history of mankind\n\n00:16:44.958 --> 00:16:46.958\nwas able to muster for his rescue,\n\n00:16:46.958 --> 00:16:50.958\nbelieve it or not, was literally these heroic two American soldiers\n\n00:16:50.958 --> 00:16:52.958\nwent into the shaft. Building was shaking.\n\n00:16:52.958 --> 00:16:56.958\nOne of them had been at 9/11 and lost his buddies on September 11th,\n\n00:16:56.958 --> 00:16:58.958\nand yet went in and risked his life in order to save Sergio.\n\n00:16:58.958 --> 00:17:02.958\nBut all they had was a woman's handbag --\n\n00:17:02.958 --> 00:17:04.958\nliterally one of those basket handbags --\n\n00:17:04.958 --> 00:17:08.958\nand they tied it to a curtain rope from one of the offices at U.N. headquarters,\n\n00:17:08.958 --> 00:17:13.958\nand created a pulley system into this shaft in this quivering building\n\n00:17:13.958 --> 00:17:16.958\nin the interests of rescuing this person,\n\n00:17:16.958 --> 00:17:19.958\nthe person we most need to turn to now, this shepherd,\n\n00:17:19.958 --> 00:17:22.958\nat a time when so many of us feel like we're lacking guidance.\n\n00:17:22.958 --> 00:17:25.958\nAnd this was the pulley system. This was what we were able to muster for Sergio.\n\n00:17:25.958 --> 00:17:27.958\nThe good news, for what it's worth,\n\n00:17:27.958 --> 00:17:31.958\nis after Sergio and 21 others were killed that day in the attack on the U.N.,\n\n00:17:31.958 --> 00:17:33.958\nthe military created a search and rescue unit\n\n00:17:33.958 --> 00:17:37.958\nthat had the cutting equipment, the shoring wood, the cranes,\n\n00:17:37.958 --> 00:17:39.958\nthe things that you would have needed to do the rescue.\n\n00:17:39.958 --> 00:17:41.958\nBut it was too late for Sergio.\n\n00:17:41.958 --> 00:17:43.958\nI want to wrap up, but I want to close\n\n00:17:43.958 --> 00:17:47.958\nwith what I take to be the four lessons from Sergio's life\n\n00:17:47.958 --> 00:17:50.958\non this question of how do we prevent evil from prevailing,\n\n00:17:50.958 --> 00:17:53.958\nwhich is how I would have framed the question.\n\n00:17:53.958 --> 00:17:56.958\nHere's this guy who got a 34-year head start\n\n00:17:56.958 --> 00:18:00.958\nthinking about the kinds of questions we as a country are grappling with,\n\n00:18:00.958 --> 00:18:05.958\nwe as citizens are grappling with now. What do we take away?\n\n00:18:05.958 --> 00:18:10.958\nFirst, I think, is his relationship to, in fact, evil is something to learn from.\n\n00:18:10.958 --> 00:18:13.958\nHe, over the course of his career, changed a great deal.\n\n00:18:13.958 --> 00:18:15.958\nHe had a lot of flaws, but he was very adaptive.\n\n00:18:15.958 --> 00:18:17.958\nI think that was his greatest quality.\n\n00:18:17.958 --> 00:18:21.958\nHe started as somebody who would denounce harmdoers,\n\n00:18:21.958 --> 00:18:24.958\nhe would charge up to people who were violating international law,\n\n00:18:24.958 --> 00:18:26.958\nand he would say, you're violating, this is the U.N. Charter.\n\n00:18:26.958 --> 00:18:28.958\nDon't you see it's unacceptable what you're doing?\n\n00:18:28.958 --> 00:18:31.958\nAnd they would laugh at him because he didn't have the power of states,\n\n00:18:31.958 --> 00:18:33.958\nthe power of any military or police.\n\n00:18:33.958 --> 00:18:36.958\nHe just had the rules, he had the norms, and he tried to use them.\n\n00:18:36.958 --> 00:18:39.958\nAnd in Lebanon, Southern Lebanon in '82,\n\n00:18:39.958 --> 00:18:42.958\nhe said to himself and to everybody else,\n\n00:18:42.958 --> 00:18:45.958\nI will never use the word \"unacceptable\" again.\n\n00:18:45.958 --> 00:18:47.958\nI will never use it. I will try to make it such,\n\n00:18:47.958 --> 00:18:49.958\nbut I will never use that word again.\n\n00:18:49.958 --> 00:18:51.958\nBut he lunged in the opposite direction.\n\n00:18:51.958 --> 00:18:54.958\nHe started, as I mentioned, to get in the room with evil,\n\n00:18:54.958 --> 00:18:58.958\nto not denounce, and became almost obsequious\n\n00:18:58.958 --> 00:19:01.958\nwhen he won the nickname Serbio, for instance,\n\n00:19:01.958 --> 00:19:03.958\nand even when he negotiated with the Khmer Rouge\n\n00:19:03.958 --> 00:19:07.958\nwould black-box what had occurred prior to entering the room.\n\n00:19:07.958 --> 00:19:10.958\nBut by the end of his life, I think he had struck a balance\n\n00:19:10.958 --> 00:19:12.958\nthat we as a country can learn from.\n\n00:19:12.958 --> 00:19:16.958\nBe in the room, don't be afraid of talking to your adversaries,\n\n00:19:16.958 --> 00:19:20.958\nbut don't bracket what happened before you entered the room.\n\n00:19:20.958 --> 00:19:25.958\nDon't black-box history. Don't check your principles at the door.\n\n00:19:25.958 --> 00:19:28.958\nAnd I think that's something that we have to be in the room,\n\n00:19:28.958 --> 00:19:32.958\nwhether it's Nixon going to China or Khrushchev and Kennedy\n\n00:19:32.958 --> 00:19:34.958\nor Reagan and Gorbachev.\n\n00:19:34.958 --> 00:19:38.958\nAll the great progress in this country with relation to our adversaries\n\n00:19:38.958 --> 00:19:40.958\nhas come by going into the room.\n\n00:19:40.958 --> 00:19:43.958\nAnd it doesn't have to be an act of weakness.\n\n00:19:43.958 --> 00:19:46.958\nYou can actually do far more to build an international coalition\n\n00:19:46.958 --> 00:19:49.958\nagainst a harmdoer or a wrongdoer by being in the room\n\n00:19:49.958 --> 00:19:52.958\nand showing to the rest of the world that that person, that regime,\n\n00:19:52.958 --> 00:19:55.958\nis the problem and that you, the United States, are not the problem.\n\n00:19:55.958 --> 00:19:59.958\nSecond take-away from Sergio's life, briefly.\n\n00:19:59.958 --> 00:20:01.958\nWhat I take away, and this in some ways is the most important,\n\n00:20:01.958 --> 00:20:07.958\nhe espoused and exhibited a reverence for dignity\n\n00:20:07.958 --> 00:20:09.958\nthat was really, really unusual.\n\n00:20:09.958 --> 00:20:13.958\nAt a micro level, the individuals around him were visible.\n\n00:20:13.958 --> 00:20:14.958\nHe saw them.\n\n00:20:14.958 --> 00:20:16.958\nAt a macro level, he thought, you know,\n\n00:20:16.958 --> 00:20:19.958\nwe talk about democracy promotion, but we do it in a way sometimes\n\n00:20:19.958 --> 00:20:22.958\nthat's an affront to people's dignity.\n\n00:20:22.958 --> 00:20:24.958\nWe put people on humanitarian aid\n\n00:20:24.958 --> 00:20:26.958\nand we boast about it because we've spent three billion.\n\n00:20:26.958 --> 00:20:27.958\nIt's incredibly important,\n\n00:20:27.958 --> 00:20:29.958\nthose people would no longer be alive if the United States, for instance,\n\n00:20:29.958 --> 00:20:32.958\nhadn't spent that money in Darfur,\n\n00:20:32.958 --> 00:20:33.958\nbut it's not a way to live.\n\n00:20:33.958 --> 00:20:36.958\nIf we think about dignity in our conduct as citizens\n\n00:20:36.958 --> 00:20:39.958\nand as individuals with relation to the people around us,\n\n00:20:39.958 --> 00:20:41.958\nand as a country, if we could inject a regard for dignity\n\n00:20:41.958 --> 00:20:44.958\ninto our dealings with other countries,\n\n00:20:44.958 --> 00:20:46.958\nit would be something of a revolution.\n\n00:20:46.958 --> 00:20:50.958\nThird point, very briefly. He talked a lot about freedom from fear.\n\n00:20:50.958 --> 00:20:53.958\nAnd I recognize there is so much to be afraid of.\n\n00:20:53.958 --> 00:20:55.958\nThere are so many genuine threats in the world.\n\n00:20:55.958 --> 00:20:57.958\nBut what Sergio was talking about is,\n\n00:20:57.958 --> 00:20:59.958\nlet's calibrate our relationship to the threat.\n\n00:20:59.958 --> 00:21:02.958\nLet's not hype the threat; let's actually see it clearly.\n\n00:21:02.958 --> 00:21:05.958\nWe have reason to be afraid of melting ice caps.\n\n00:21:05.958 --> 00:21:08.958\nWe have reason to be afraid that we haven't secured\n\n00:21:08.958 --> 00:21:11.958\nloose nuclear material in the former Soviet Union.\n\n00:21:11.958 --> 00:21:15.958\nLet's focus on what are the legitimate challenges and threats,\n\n00:21:15.958 --> 00:21:20.958\nbut not lunge into bad decisions because of a panic, of a fear.\n\n00:21:20.958 --> 00:21:22.958\nIn times of fear, for instance, one of the things Sergio used to say\n\n00:21:22.958 --> 00:21:24.958\nis, fear is a bad advisor.\n\n00:21:24.958 --> 00:21:26.958\nWe lunge towards the extremes\n\n00:21:26.958 --> 00:21:28.958\nwhen we aren't operating and trying to, again,\n\n00:21:28.958 --> 00:21:30.958\ncalibrate our relationship to the world around us.\n\n00:21:30.958 --> 00:21:33.958\nFourth and final point: he somehow, because he was working\n\n00:21:33.958 --> 00:21:36.958\nin all the world's worst places and all lesser evils,\n\n00:21:36.958 --> 00:21:38.958\nhad a humility, of course,\n\n00:21:38.958 --> 00:21:41.958\nand an awareness of the complexity of the world around him.\n\n00:21:41.958 --> 00:21:43.958\nI mean, such an acute awareness of how hard it was.\n\n00:21:43.958 --> 00:21:47.958\nHow Sisyphean this task was of mending,\n\n00:21:47.958 --> 00:21:49.958\nand yet aware of that complexity, \n\n\n00:21:49.958 --> 00:21:52.958\nhumbled by it, he wasn't paralyzed by it.\n\n00:21:52.958 --> 00:21:57.958\nAnd we as citizens, as we go through this experience of the kind of,\n\n00:21:57.958 --> 00:22:01.958\nthe crisis of confidence, crisis of competence, crisis of legitimacy,\n\n00:22:01.958 --> 00:22:04.958\nI think there's a temptation to pull back from the world and say,\n\n00:22:04.958 --> 00:22:06.958\nah, Katrina, Iraq -- we don't know what we're doing.\n\n00:22:06.958 --> 00:22:09.958\nWe can't afford to pull back from the world.\n\n00:22:09.958 --> 00:22:12.958\nIt's a question of how to be in the world.\n\n00:22:12.958 --> 00:22:13.958\nAnd the lesson, I think,\n\n00:22:13.958 --> 00:22:15.958\nof the anti-genocide movement that I mentioned,\n\n00:22:15.958 --> 00:22:17.958\nthat is a partial success but by no means\n\n00:22:17.958 --> 00:22:20.958\nhas it achieved what it has set out to do --\n\n00:22:20.958 --> 00:22:23.958\nit'll be many decades, probably, before that happens --\n\n00:22:23.958 --> 00:22:27.958\nbut is that if we want to see change, we have to become the change.\n\n00:22:27.958 --> 00:22:31.958\nWe can't rely upon our institutions to do the work\n\n00:22:31.958 --> 00:22:35.958\nof necessarily talking to adversaries on their own\n\n00:22:35.958 --> 00:22:37.958\nwithout us creating a space for that to happen,\n\n00:22:37.958 --> 00:22:39.958\nfor having respect for dignity,\n\n00:22:39.958 --> 00:22:41.958\nand for bringing that combination of humility\n\n00:22:41.958 --> 00:22:44.958\nand a sort of emboldened sense of responsibility\n\n00:22:44.958 --> 00:22:46.958\nto our dealings with the rest of the world.\n\n00:22:46.958 --> 00:22:48.958\nSo will evil prevail? Is that the question?\n\n00:22:48.958 --> 00:22:52.958\nI think the short answer is: no, not unless we let it.\n\n00:22:52.958 --> 00:22:53.958\nThank you.\n\n00:22:53.958 --> 00:22:56.958\n(Applause)"}, {"title": "The story behind the Mars Rovers", "duration": "1697", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/charles_elachi_on_the_mars_rovers", "transcript": "I thought I'd start with telling you or showing you the people who started [Jet Propulsion Lab]. When they were a bunch of kids, they were kind of very imaginative, very adventurous, as they were trying at Caltech to mix chemicals and see which one blows up more. Well, I don't recommend that you try to do that now. Naturally, they blew up a shack, and Caltech, well, then, hey, you go to the Arroyo and really do all your tests in there.So, that's what we call our first five employees during the tea break, you know, in here. As I said, they were adventurous people. As a matter of fact, one of them, who was, kind of, part of a cult which was not too far from here on Orange Grove, and unfortunately he blew up himself because he kept mixing chemicals and trying to figure out which ones were the best chemicals. So, that gives you a kind of flavor of the kind of people we have there. We try to avoid blowing ourselves up.This one I thought I'd show you. Guess which one is a JPL employee in the heart of this crowd. I tried to come like him this morning, but as I walked out, then it was too cold, and I said, I'd better put my shirt back on. But more importantly, the reason I wanted to show this picture: look where the other people are looking, and look where he is looking. Wherever anybody else looks, look somewhere else, and go do something different, you know, and doing that. And that's kind of what has been the spirit of what we are doing.And I want to tell you a quote from Ralph Emerson that one of my colleagues, you know, put on my wall in my office, and it says, \"Do not go where the path may lead. Go instead where there is no path, and leave a trail.\" And that's my recommendation to all of you: look what everybody is doing, what they are doing; go do something completely different. Don't try to improve a little bit on what somebody else is doing, because that doesn't get you very far.In our early days we used to work a lot on rockets, but we also used to have a lot of parties, you know. As you can see, one of our parties, you know, a few years ago. But then a big difference happened about 50 years ago, after Sputnik was launched. We launched the first American satellite, and that's the one you see on the left in there. And here we made 180 degrees change: we changed from a rocket house to be an exploration house. And that was done over a period of a couple of years, and now we are the leading organization, you know, exploring space on all of your behalf.But even when we did that, we had to remind ourselves, sometimes there are setbacks. So you see, on the bottom, that rocket was supposed to go upward; somehow it ended going sideways. So that's what we call the misguided missile. But then also, just to celebrate that, we started an event at JPL for \"Miss Guided Missile.\"So, we used to have a celebration every year and select \u2014 there used to be competition and parades and so on. It's not very appropriate to do it now. Some people tell me to do it; I think, well, that's not really proper, you know, these days. So, we do something a little bit more serious. And that's what you see in the last Rose Bowl, you know, when we entered one of the floats. That's more on the play side. And on the right side, that's the Rover just before we finished its testing to take it to the Cape to launch it. These are the Rovers up here that you have on Mars now. So that kind of tells you about, kind of, the fun things, you know, and the serious things that we try to do. But I said I'm going to show you a short clip of one of our employees to kind of give you an idea about some of the talent that we have.Video: Morgan Hendry: Beware of Safety is an instrumental rock band. It branches on more the experimental side. There's the improvisational side of jazz. There's the heavy-hitting sound of rock. Being able to treat sound as an instrument, and be able to dig for more abstract sounds and things to play live, mixing electronics and acoustics. The music's half of me, but the other half \u2014 I landed probably the best gig of all. I work for the Jet Propulsion Lab. I'm building the next Mars Rover. Some of the most brilliant engineers I know are the ones who have that sort of artistic quality about them. You've got to do what you want to do. And anyone who tells you you can't, you don't listen to them. Maybe they're right - I doubt it. Tell them where to put it, and then just do what you want to do. I'm Morgan Hendry. I am NASA.Charles Elachi: Now, moving from the play stuff to the serious stuff, always people ask, why do we explore? Why are we doing all of these missions and why are we exploring them? Well, the way I think about it is fairly simple. Somehow, 13 billion years ago there was a Big Bang, and you've heard a little bit about, you know, the origin of the universe. But somehow what strikes everybody's imagination \u2014 or lots of people's imagination \u2014 somehow from that original Big Bang we have this beautiful world that we live in today.You look outside: you have all that beauty that you see, all that life that you see around you, and here we have intelligent people like you and I who are having a conversation here. All that started from that Big Bang. So, the question is: How did that happen? How did that evolve? How did the universe form? How did the galaxies form? How did the planets form? Why is there a planet on which there is life which have evolved? Is that very common? Is there life on every planet that you can see around the stars? So we literally are all made out of stardust. We started from those stars; we are made of stardust. So, next time you are really depressed, look in the mirror and you can look and say, hi, I'm looking at a star here. You can skip the dust part. But literally, we are all made of stardust.So, what we are trying to do in our exploration is effectively write the book of how things have came about as they are today. And one of the first, or the easiest, places we can go and explore that is to go towards Mars. And the reason Mars takes particular attention: it's not very far from us. You know, it'll take us only six months to get there. Six to nine months at the right time of the year. It's a planet somewhat similar to Earth. It's a little bit smaller, but the land mass on Mars is about the same as the land mass on Earth, you know, if you don't take the oceans into account. It has polar caps. It has an atmosphere somewhat thinner than ours, so it has weather. So, it's very similar to some extent, and you can see some of the features on it, like the Grand Canyon on Mars, or what we call the Grand Canyon on Mars. It is like the Grand Canyon on Earth, except a hell of a lot larger.So it's about the size, you know, of the United States. It has volcanoes on it. And that's Mount Olympus on Mars, which is a kind of huge volcanic shield on that planet. And if you look at the height of it and you compare it to Mount Everest, you see, it'll give you an idea of how large that Mount Olympus, you know, is, relative to Mount Everest. So, it basically dwarfs, you know, Mount Everest here on Earth. So, that gives you an idea of the tectonic events or volcanic events which have happened on that planet. Recently from one of our satellites, this shows that it's Earth-like \u2014 we caught a landslide occurring as it was happening. So it is a dynamic planet, and activity is going on as we speak today.And these Rovers, people wonder now, what are they doing today, so I thought I would show you a little bit what they are doing. This is one very large crater. Geologists love craters, because craters are like digging a big hole in the ground without really working at it, and you can see what's below the surface. So, this is called Victoria Crater, which is about a few football fields in size. And if you look at the top left, you see a little teeny dark dot. This picture was taken from an orbiting satellite. If I zoom on it, you can see: that's the Rover on the surface. So, that was taken from orbit; we had the camera zoom on the surface, and we actually saw the Rover on the surface. And we actually used the combination of the satellite images and the Rover to actually conduct science, because we can observe large areas and then you can get those Rovers to move around and basically go to a certain location.So, specifically what we are doing now is that Rover is going down in that crater. As I told you, geologists love craters. And the reason is, many of you went to the Grand Canyon, and you see in the wall of the Grand Canyon, you see these layers. And what these layers \u2014 that's what the surface used to be a million years ago, 10 million years ago, 100 million years ago, and you get deposits on top of them. So if you can read the layers it's like reading your book, and you can learn the history of what happened in the past in that location.So what you are seeing here are the layers on the wall of that crater, and the Rover is going down now, measuring, you know, the properties and analyzing the rocks as it's going down, you know, that canyon. Now, it's kind of a little bit of a challenge driving down a slope like this. If you were there you wouldn't do it yourself. But we really made sure we tested those Rovers before we got them down \u2014 or that Rover \u2014 and made sure that it's all working well.Now, when I came last time, shortly after the landing \u2014 I think it was, like, a hundred days after the landing \u2014 I told you I was surprised that those Rovers are lasting even a hundred days. Well, here we are four years later, and they're still working. Now you say, Charles, you are really lying to us, and so on, but that's not true. We really believed they were going to last 90 days or 100 days, because they are solar powered, and Mars is a dusty planet, so we expected the dust would start accumulating on the surface, and after a while we wouldn't have enough power, you know, to keep them warm.Well, I always say it's important that you are smart, but every once in a while it's good to be lucky. And that's what we found out. It turned out that every once in a while there are dust devils which come by on Mars, as you are seeing here, and when the dust devil comes over the Rover, it just cleans it up. It is like a brand new car that you have, and that's literally why they have lasted so long. And now we designed them reasonably well, but that's exactly why they are lasting that long and still providing all the science data. Now, the two Rovers, each one of them is, kind of, getting old. You know, one of them, one of the wheels is stuck, is not working, one of the front wheels, so what we are doing, we are driving it backwards. And the other one has arthritis of the shoulder joint, you know, it's not working very well, so it's walking like this, and we can move the arm, you know, that way. But still they are producing a lot of scientific data. Now, during that whole period, a number of people got excited, you know, outside the science community about these Rovers, so I thought I'd show you a video just to give you a reflection about how these Rovers are being viewed by people other than the science community.So let me go on the next short video. By the way, this video is pretty accurate of how the landing took place, you know, about four years ago. Video: Okay, we have parachute aligned. Okay, deploy the airbags. Open. Camera. We have a picture right now. Yeah! CE: That's about what happened in the Houston operation room. It's exactly like this. Video: Now, if there is life, the Dutch will find it. What is he doing? What is that? CE: Not too bad.So anyway, let me continue on showing you a little bit about the beauty of that planet. As I said earlier, it looked very much like Earth, so you see sand dunes. It looks like I could have told you these are pictures taken from the Sahara Desert or somewhere, and you'd have believed me, but these are pictures taken from Mars. But one area which is particularly intriguing for us is the northern region, you know, of Mars, close to the North Pole, because we see ice caps, and we see the ice caps shrinking and expanding, so it's very much like you have in northern Canada. And we wanted to find out \u2014 and we see all kinds of glacial features on it. So, we wanted to find out, actually, what is that ice made of, and could that have embedded in it some organic, you know, material.So we have a spacecraft which is heading towards Mars, called Phoenix, and that spacecraft will land 17 days, seven hours and 20 seconds from now, so you can adjust your watch. So it's on May 25 around just before five o'clock our time here on the West Coast, actually we will be landing on another planet. And as you can see, this is a picture of the spacecraft put on Mars, but I thought that just in case you're going to miss that show, you know, in 17 days, I'll show you, kind of, a little bit of what's going to happen.Video: That's what we call the seven minutes of terror. So the plan is to dig in the soil and take samples that we put them in an oven and actually heat them and look what gases will come from it. So this was launched about nine months ago. We'll be coming in at 12,000 miles per hour, and in seven minutes we have to stop and touch the surface very softly so we don't break that lander.Ben Cichy: Phoenix is the first Mars Scout mission. It's the first mission that's going to try to land near the North Pole of Mars, and it's the first mission that's actually going to try and reach out and touch water on the surface of another planet.Lynn Craig: Where there tends to be water, at least on Earth, there tends to be life, and so it's potentially a place where life could have existed on the planet in the past.Erik Bailey: The main purpose of EDL is to take a spacecraft that is traveling at 12,500 miles an hour and bring it to a screeching halt in a soft way in a very short amount of time. BC: We enter the Martian atmosphere. We're 70 miles above the surface of Mars. And our lander is safely tucked inside what we call an aeroshell.EB: Looks kind of like an ice cream cone, more or less.BC: And on the front of it is this heat shield, this saucer-looking thing that has about a half-inch of essentially what's cork on the front of it, which is our heat shield. Now, this is really special cork, and this cork is what's going to protect us from the violent atmospheric entry that we're about to experience.Rob Grover: Friction really starts to build up on the spacecraft, and we use the friction when it's flying through the atmosphere to our advantage to slow us down. BC: From this point, we're going to decelerate from 12,500 miles an hour down to 900 miles an hour.EB: The outside can get almost as hot as the surface of the Sun.RG: The temperature of the heat shield can reach 2,600 degrees Fahrenheit.EB: The inside doesn't get very hot. It probably gets about room temperature. Richard Kornfeld: There is this window of opportunity within which we can deploy the parachute.EB: If you fire the 'chute too early, the parachute itself could fail. The fabric and the stitching could just pull apart. And that would be bad.BC: In the first 15 seconds after we deploy the parachute, we'll decelerate from 900 miles an hour to a relatively slow 250 miles an hour. We no longer need the heat shield to protect us from the force of atmospheric entry, so we jettison the heat shield, exposing for the first time our lander to the atmosphere of Mars.LC: After the heat shield has been jettisoned and the legs are deployed, the next step is to have the radar system begin to detect how far Phoenix really is from the ground.BC: We've lost 99 percent of our entry velocity. So, we're 99 percent of the way to where we want to be. But that last one percent, as it always seems to be, is the tricky part.EB: Now the spacecraft actually has to decide when it's going to get rid of its parachute.BC: We separate from the lander going 125 miles an hour at roughly a kilometer above the surface of Mars: 3,200 feet. That's like taking two Empire State Buildings and stacking them on top of one another.EB: That's when we separate from the back shell, and we're now in free-fall. It's a very scary moment; a lot has to happen in a very short amount of time. LC: So it's in a free-fall, but it's also trying to use all of its actuators to make sure that it's in the right position to land.EB: And then it has to light up its engines, right itself, and then slowly slow itself down and touch down on the ground safely.BC: Earth and Mars are so far apart that it takes over ten minutes for a signal from Mars to get to Earth. And EDL itself is all over in a matter of seven minutes. So by the time you even hear from the lander that EDL has started it'll already be over.EB: We have to build large amounts of autonomy into the spacecraft so that it can land itself safely.BC: EDL is this immense, technically challenging problem. It's about getting a spacecraft that's hurtling through deep space and using all this bag of tricks to somehow figure out how to get it down to the surface of Mars at zero miles an hour. It's this immensely exciting and challenging problem.CE: Hopefully it all will happen the way you saw it in here. So it will be a very tense moment, you know, as we are watching that spacecraft landing on another planet.So now let me talk about the next things that we are doing. So we are in the process, as we speak, of actually designing the next Rover that we are going to be sending to Mars. So I thought I would go a little bit and tell you, kind of, the steps we go through. It's very similar to what you do when you design your product. As you saw a little bit earlier, when we were doing the Phoenix one, we have to take into account the heat that we are going to be facing. So we have to study all kinds of different materials, the shape that we want to do. In general we don't try to please the customer here. What we want to do is to make sure we have an effective, you know, an efficient kind of machine.First we start by we want to have our employees to be as imaginative as they can. And we really love being close to the art center, because we have, as a matter of fact, one of the alumni from the art center, Eric Nyquist, had put a series of displays, far-out displays, you know, in our what we call mission design or spacecraft design room, just to get people to think wildly about things. We have a bunch of Legos. So, as I said, this is a playground for adults, where they sit down and try to play with different shapes and different designs.Then we get a little bit more serious, so we have what we call our CAD/CAMs and all the engineers who are involved, or scientists who are involved, who know about thermal properties, know about design, know about atmospheric interaction, parachutes, all of these things, which they work in a team effort and actually design a spacecraft in a computer to some extent, so to see, does that meet the requirement that we need. On the right, also, we have to take into account the environment of the planet where we are going. If you are going to Jupiter, you have a very high-radiation, you know, environment. It's about the same radiation environment close by Jupiter as inside a nuclear reactor.So just imagine: you take your P.C. and throw it into a nuclear reactor and it still has to work. So these are kind of some of the little challenges, you know, that we have to face. If we are doing entry, we have to do tests of parachutes. You saw in the video a parachute breaking. That would be a bad day, you know, if that happened, so we have to test, because we are deploying this parachute at supersonic speeds. We are coming at extremely high speeds, and we are deploying them to slow us down. So we have to do all kinds of tests. To give you an idea of the size, you know, of that parachute relative to the people standing there.Next step, we go and actually build some kind of test models and actually test them, you know, in the lab at JPL, in what we call our Mars Yard. We kick them, we hit them, we drop them, just to make sure we understand how, where would they break. And then we back off, you know, from that point. And then we actually do the actual building and the flight. And this next Rover that we're flying is about the size of a car. That big shield that you see outside, that's a heat shield which is going to protect it. And that will be basically built over the next year, and it will be launched June a year from now. Now, in that case, because it was a very big Rover, we couldn't use airbags. And I know many of you, kind of, last time afterwards said well, that was a cool thing to have \u2014 those airbags. Unfortunately this Rover is, like, ten times the size of the, you know, mass-wise, of the other Rover, or three times the mass. So we can't use airbags. So we have to come up with another ingenious idea of how do we land it. And we didn't want to take it propulsively all the way to the surface because we didn't want to contaminate the surface; we wanted the Rover to immediately land on its legs.So we came up with this ingenious idea, which is used here on Earth for helicopters. Actually, the lander will come down to about 100 feet and hover above that surface for 100 feet, and then we have a sky crane which will take that Rover and land it down on the surface. Hopefully it all will work, you know, it will work that way. And that Rover will be more kind of like a chemist. What we are going to be doing with that Rover as it drives around, it's going to go and analyze the chemical composition of rocks. So it will have an arm which will take samples, put them in an oven, crush and analyze them. But also, if there is something that we cannot reach because it is too high on a cliff, we have a little laser system which will actually zap the rock, evaporate some of it, and actually analyze what's coming from that rock. So it's a little bit like \"Star Wars,\" you know, but it's real. It's real stuff. And also to help you, to help the community so you can do ads on that Rover, we are going to train that Rover to actually in addition to do this, to actually serve cocktails, you know, also on Mars.So that's kind of giving you an idea of the kind of, you know, fun things we are doing on Mars. I thought I'd go to \"The Lord of the Rings\" now and show you some of the things we have there. Now, \"The Lord of the Rings\" has two things played through it. One, it's a very attractive planet \u2014 it just has the beauty of the rings and so on. But for scientists, also the rings have a special meaning, because we believe they represent, on a small scale, how the Solar System actually formed. Some of the scientists believe that the way the Solar System formed, that the Sun when it collapsed and actually created the Sun, a lot of the dust around it created rings and then the particles in those rings accumulated together, and they formed bigger rocks, and then that's how the planets, you know, were formed.So, the idea is, by watching Saturn we're actually watching our solar system in real time being formed on a smaller scale, so it's like a test bed for it. So, let me show you a little bit on what that Saturnian system looks like. First, I'm going to fly you over the rings. By the way, all of this is real stuff. This is not animation or anything like this. This is actually taken from the satellite that we have in orbit around Saturn, the Cassini. And you see the amount of detail that is in those rings, which are the particles. Some of them are agglomerating together to form larger particles. So that's why you have these gaps, is because a small satellite, you know, is being formed in that location. Now, you think that those rings are very large objects. Yes, they are very large in one dimension; in the other dimension they are paper thin. Very, very thin. What you are seeing here is the shadow of the ring on Saturn itself. And that's one of the satellites which was actually formed on that one. So, think about it as a paper-thin, huge area of many hundreds of thousands of miles, which is rotating.And we have a wide variety of kind of satellites which will form, each one looking very different and very odd, and that keeps scientists busy for tens of years trying to explain this, and telling NASA we need more money so we can explain what these things look like, or why they formed that way. Well, there were two satellites which were particularly interesting. One of them is called Enceladus. It's a satellite which was all made of ice, and we measured it from orbit. Made of ice. But there was something bizarre about it. If you look at these stripes in here, what we call tiger stripes, when we flew over them, all of a sudden we saw an increase in the temperature, which said that those stripes are warmer than the rest of the planet.So as we flew by away from it, we looked back. And guess what? We saw geysers coming out. So this is a Yellowstone, you know, of Saturn. We are seeing geysers of ice which are coming out of that planet, which indicate that most likely there is an ocean, you know, below the surface. And somehow, through some dynamic effect, we're having these geysers which are being, you know, emitted from it. And the reason I showed the little arrow there, I think that should say 30 miles, we decided a few months ago to actually fly the spacecraft through the plume of that geyser so we can actually measure the material that it is made of. That was [unclear] also \u2014 you know, because we were worried about the risk of it, but it worked pretty well. We flew at the top of it, and we found that there is a fair amount of organic material which is being emitted in combination with the ice. And over the next few years, as we keep orbiting, you know, Saturn, we are planning to get closer and closer down to the surface and make more accurate measurements.Now, another satellite also attracted a lot of attention, and that's Titan. And the reason Titan is particularly interesting, it's a satellite bigger than our moon, and it has an atmosphere. And that atmosphere is very \u2014 as dense as our own atmosphere. So if you were on Titan, you would feel the same pressure that you feel in here. Except it's a lot colder, and that atmosphere is heavily made of methane. Now, methane gets people all excited, because it's organic material, so immediately people start thinking, could life have evolved in that location, when you have a lot of organic material. So people believe now that Titan is most likely what we call a pre-biotic planet, because it's so cold organic material did not get to the stage of becoming biological material, and therefore life could have evolved on it.So it could be Earth, frozen three billion years ago before life actually started on it. So that's getting a lot of interest, and to show you some example of what we did in there, we actually dropped a probe, which was developed by our colleagues in Europe, we dropped a probe as we were orbiting Saturn. We dropped a probe in the atmosphere of Titan. And this is a picture of an area as we were coming down. Just looked like the coast of California for me. You see the rivers which are coming along the coast, and you see that white area which looks like Catalina Island, and that looks like an ocean. And then with an instrument we have on board, a radar instrument, we found there are lakes like the Great Lakes in here, so it looks very much like Earth. It looks like there are rivers on it, there are oceans or lakes, we know there are clouds. We think it's raining also on it. So it's very much like the cycle on Earth except because it's so cold, it could not be water, you know, because water would have frozen. What it turned out, that all that we are seeing, all this liquid, [is made of] hydrocarbon and ethane and methane, similar to what you put in your car.So here we have a cycle of a planet which is like our Earth, but is all made of ethane and methane and organic material. So if you were on Mars \u2014 sorry, on Titan, you don't have to worry about four-dollar gasoline. You just drive to the nearest lake, stick your hose in it, and you've got your car filled up. On the other hand, if you light a match the whole planet will blow up. So in closing, I said I want to close by a couple of pictures. And just to kind of put us in perspective, this is a picture of Saturn taken with a spacecraft from behind Saturn, looking towards the Sun. The Sun is behind Saturn, so we see what we call \"forward scattering,\" so it highlights all the rings. And I'm going to zoom. There is a \u2014 I'm not sure you can see it very well, but on the top left, around 10 o'clock, there is a little teeny dot, and that's Earth. You barely can see ourselves. So what I did, I thought I'd zoom on it. So as you zoom in, you know, you can see Earth, you know, just in the middle here. So we zoomed all the way on the art center.So thank you very much.", "id": 399, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:11.958 --> 00:00:15.958\nI thought I'd start with telling you or showing you the people who started [Jet Propulsion Lab].\n\n00:00:15.958 --> 00:00:17.958\nWhen they were a bunch of kids,\n\n00:00:17.958 --> 00:00:20.958\nthey were kind of very imaginative, very adventurous,\n\n00:00:20.958 --> 00:00:22.958\nas they were trying at Caltech to mix chemicals\n\n00:00:22.958 --> 00:00:24.958\nand see which one blows up more.\n\n00:00:24.958 --> 00:00:27.958\nWell, I don't recommend that you try to do that now.\n\n00:00:27.958 --> 00:00:29.958\nNaturally, they blew up a shack, and Caltech, well, then,\n\n00:00:29.958 --> 00:00:33.958\nhey, you go to the Arroyo and really do all your tests in there.\n\n00:00:33.958 --> 00:00:36.958\nSo, that's what we call our first five employees\n\n00:00:36.958 --> 00:00:39.958\nduring the tea break, you know, in here.\n\n00:00:39.958 --> 00:00:41.958\nAs I said, they were adventurous people.\n\n00:00:41.958 --> 00:00:45.958\nAs a matter of fact, one of them, who was, kind of, part of a cult\n\n00:00:45.958 --> 00:00:49.958\nwhich was not too far from here on Orange Grove,\n\n00:00:49.958 --> 00:00:53.958\nand unfortunately he blew up himself because he kept mixing chemicals\n\n00:00:53.958 --> 00:00:55.958\nand trying to figure out which ones were the best chemicals.\n\n00:00:55.958 --> 00:00:57.958\nSo, that gives you a kind of flavor\n\n00:00:57.958 --> 00:00:58.958\nof the kind of people we have there.\n\n00:00:58.958 --> 00:01:00.958\nWe try to avoid blowing ourselves up.\n\n00:01:00.958 --> 00:01:02.958\nThis one I thought I'd show you.\n\n00:01:02.958 --> 00:01:05.958\nGuess which one is a JPL employee in the heart of this crowd.\n\n00:01:05.958 --> 00:01:08.958\nI tried to come like him this morning,\n\n00:01:08.958 --> 00:01:10.958\nbut as I walked out, then it was too cold,\n\n00:01:10.958 --> 00:01:12.958\nand I said, I'd better put my shirt back on.\n\n00:01:12.958 --> 00:01:15.958\nBut more importantly, the reason I wanted to show this picture:\n\n00:01:15.958 --> 00:01:17.958\nlook where the other people are looking,\n\n00:01:17.958 --> 00:01:20.958\nand look where he is looking.\n\n00:01:20.958 --> 00:01:22.958\nWherever anybody else looks, look somewhere else,\n\n00:01:22.958 --> 00:01:25.958\nand go do something different, you know, and doing that.\n\n00:01:25.958 --> 00:01:28.958\nAnd that's kind of what has been the spirit of what we are doing.\n\n00:01:28.958 --> 00:01:31.958\nAnd I want to tell you a quote from Ralph Emerson\n\n00:01:31.958 --> 00:01:34.958\nthat one of my colleagues, you know, put on my wall in my office,\n\n00:01:34.958 --> 00:01:37.958\nand it says, \"Do not go where the path may lead.\n\n00:01:37.958 --> 00:01:39.958\nGo instead where there is no path, and leave a trail.\"\n\n00:01:39.958 --> 00:01:41.958\nAnd that's my recommendation to all of you:\n\n00:01:41.958 --> 00:01:43.958\nlook what everybody is doing, what they are doing;\n\n00:01:43.958 --> 00:01:45.958\ngo do something completely different.\n\n00:01:45.958 --> 00:01:48.958\nDon't try to improve a little bit on what somebody else is doing,\n\n00:01:48.958 --> 00:01:50.958\nbecause that doesn't get you very far.\n\n00:01:50.958 --> 00:01:53.958\nIn our early days we used to work a lot on rockets,\n\n00:01:53.958 --> 00:01:55.958\nbut we also used to have a lot of parties, you know.\n\n00:01:55.958 --> 00:01:59.958\nAs you can see, one of our parties, you know, a few years ago.\n\n00:01:59.958 --> 00:02:02.958\nBut then a big difference happened about 50 years ago,\n\n00:02:02.958 --> 00:02:06.958\nafter Sputnik was launched. We launched the first American satellite,\n\n00:02:06.958 --> 00:02:08.958\nand that's the one you see on the left in there.\n\n00:02:08.958 --> 00:02:10.958\nAnd here we made 180 degrees change:\n\n00:02:10.958 --> 00:02:14.958\nwe changed from a rocket house to be an exploration house.\n\n00:02:14.958 --> 00:02:17.958\nAnd that was done over a period of a couple of years,\n\n00:02:17.958 --> 00:02:19.958\nand now we are the leading organization, you know,\n\n00:02:19.958 --> 00:02:22.958\nexploring space on all of your behalf.\n\n00:02:22.958 --> 00:02:25.958\nBut even when we did that, we had to remind ourselves,\n\n00:02:25.958 --> 00:02:27.958\nsometimes there are setbacks.\n\n00:02:27.958 --> 00:02:30.958\nSo you see, on the bottom, that rocket was supposed to go upward;\n\n00:02:30.958 --> 00:02:32.958\nsomehow it ended going sideways.\n\n00:02:32.958 --> 00:02:35.958\nSo that's what we call the misguided missile.\n\n00:02:35.958 --> 00:02:37.958\nBut then also, just to celebrate that,\n\n00:02:37.958 --> 00:02:40.958\nwe started an event at JPL for \"Miss Guided Missile.\"\n\n00:02:40.958 --> 00:02:43.958\nSo, we used to have a celebration every year and select --\n\n00:02:43.958 --> 00:02:46.958\nthere used to be competition and parades and so on.\n\n00:02:46.958 --> 00:02:49.958\nIt's not very appropriate to do it now. Some people tell me to do it;\n\n00:02:49.958 --> 00:02:53.958\nI think, well, that's not really proper, you know, these days.\n\n00:02:53.958 --> 00:02:55.958\nSo, we do something a little bit more serious.\n\n00:02:55.958 --> 00:02:58.958\nAnd that's what you see in the last Rose Bowl, you know,\n\n00:02:58.958 --> 00:03:00.958\nwhen we entered one of the floats.\n\n00:03:00.958 --> 00:03:02.958\nThat's more on the play side. And on the right side,\n\n00:03:02.958 --> 00:03:05.958\nthat's the Rover just before we finished its testing\n\n00:03:05.958 --> 00:03:07.958\nto take it to the Cape to launch it.\n\n00:03:07.958 --> 00:03:10.958\nThese are the Rovers up here that you have on Mars now.\n\n00:03:10.958 --> 00:03:13.958\nSo that kind of tells you about, kind of, the fun things,\n\n00:03:13.958 --> 00:03:15.958\nyou know, and the serious things that we try to do.\n\n00:03:15.958 --> 00:03:17.958\nBut I said I'm going to show you a short clip\n\n00:03:17.958 --> 00:03:20.958\nof one of our employees to kind of give you an idea\n\n00:03:20.958 --> 00:03:22.958\nabout some of the talent that we have.\n\n00:03:34.958 --> 00:03:36.958\nVideo: Morgan Hendry: Beware of Safety is\n\n00:03:36.958 --> 00:03:38.958\nan instrumental rock band.\n\n00:03:38.958 --> 00:03:41.958\nIt branches on more the experimental side.\n\n00:03:41.958 --> 00:03:44.958\nThere's the improvisational side of jazz.\n\n00:03:44.958 --> 00:03:47.958\nThere's the heavy-hitting sound of rock.\n\n00:03:47.958 --> 00:03:52.958\nBeing able to treat sound as an instrument, and be able to dig\n\n00:03:52.958 --> 00:03:54.958\nfor more abstract sounds and things to play live,\n\n00:03:54.958 --> 00:03:56.958\nmixing electronics and acoustics.\n\n00:03:56.958 --> 00:04:00.958\nThe music's half of me, but the other half --\n\n00:04:00.958 --> 00:04:03.958\nI landed probably the best gig of all.\n\n00:04:03.958 --> 00:04:06.958\nI work for the Jet Propulsion Lab. I'm building the next Mars Rover.\n\n00:04:06.958 --> 00:04:09.958\nSome of the most brilliant engineers I know\n\n00:04:09.958 --> 00:04:13.958\nare the ones who have that sort of artistic quality about them.\n\n00:04:13.958 --> 00:04:15.958\nYou've got to do what you want to do.\n\n00:04:15.958 --> 00:04:18.958\nAnd anyone who tells you you can't, you don't listen to them.\n\n00:04:18.958 --> 00:04:21.958\nMaybe they're right - I doubt it.\n\n00:04:21.958 --> 00:04:23.958\nTell them where to put it, and then just do what you want to do.\n\n00:04:23.958 --> 00:04:26.958\nI'm Morgan Hendry. I am NASA.\n\n00:04:29.958 --> 00:04:32.958\nCharles Elachi: Now, moving from the play stuff to the serious stuff,\n\n00:04:32.958 --> 00:04:34.958\nalways people ask, why do we explore?\n\n00:04:34.958 --> 00:04:37.958\nWhy are we doing all of these missions and why are we exploring them?\n\n00:04:37.958 --> 00:04:39.958\nWell, the way I think about it is fairly simple.\n\n00:04:39.958 --> 00:04:42.958\nSomehow, 13 billion years ago there was a Big Bang, and you've heard\n\n00:04:42.958 --> 00:04:45.958\na little bit about, you know, the origin of the universe.\n\n00:04:45.958 --> 00:04:48.958\nBut somehow what strikes everybody's imagination --\n\n00:04:48.958 --> 00:04:51.958\nor lots of people's imagination -- somehow from that original Big Bang\n\n00:04:51.958 --> 00:04:54.958\nwe have this beautiful world that we live in today.\n\n00:04:54.958 --> 00:04:57.958\nYou look outside: you have all that beauty that you see,\n\n00:04:57.958 --> 00:04:59.958\nall that life that you see around you,\n\n00:04:59.958 --> 00:05:01.958\nand here we have intelligent people like you and I\n\n00:05:01.958 --> 00:05:03.958\nwho are having a conversation here.\n\n00:05:03.958 --> 00:05:05.958\nAll that started from that Big Bang. So, the question is:\n\n00:05:05.958 --> 00:05:10.958\nHow did that happen? How did that evolve? How did the universe form?\n\n00:05:10.958 --> 00:05:12.958\nHow did the galaxies form? How did the planets form?\n\n00:05:12.958 --> 00:05:15.958\nWhy is there a planet on which there is life which have evolved?\n\n00:05:15.958 --> 00:05:17.958\nIs that very common?\n\n00:05:17.958 --> 00:05:21.958\nIs there life on every planet that you can see around the stars?\n\n00:05:21.958 --> 00:05:23.958\nSo we literally are all made out of stardust.\n\n00:05:23.958 --> 00:05:26.958\nWe started from those stars; we are made of stardust.\n\n00:05:26.958 --> 00:05:28.958\nSo, next time you are really depressed, look in the mirror\n\n00:05:28.958 --> 00:05:30.958\nand you can look and say, hi, I'm looking at a star here.\n\n00:05:30.958 --> 00:05:32.958\nYou can skip the dust part.\n\n00:05:32.958 --> 00:05:34.958\nBut literally, we are all made of stardust.\n\n00:05:34.958 --> 00:05:38.958\nSo, what we are trying to do in our exploration is effectively\n\n00:05:38.958 --> 00:05:43.958\nwrite the book of how things have came about as they are today.\n\n00:05:43.958 --> 00:05:46.958\nAnd one of the first, or the easiest, places we can go\n\n00:05:46.958 --> 00:05:48.958\nand explore that is to go towards Mars.\n\n00:05:48.958 --> 00:05:51.958\nAnd the reason Mars takes particular attention:\n\n00:05:51.958 --> 00:05:53.958\nit's not very far from us.\n\n00:05:53.958 --> 00:05:55.958\nYou know, it'll take us only six months to get there.\n\n00:05:55.958 --> 00:05:58.958\nSix to nine months at the right time of the year.\n\n00:05:58.958 --> 00:06:00.958\nIt's a planet somewhat similar to Earth. It's a little bit smaller,\n\n00:06:00.958 --> 00:06:03.958\nbut the land mass on Mars is about the same\n\n00:06:03.958 --> 00:06:04.958\nas the land mass on Earth, you know,\n\n00:06:04.958 --> 00:06:06.958\nif you don't take the oceans into account.\n\n00:06:06.958 --> 00:06:11.958\nIt has polar caps. It has an atmosphere somewhat thinner than ours,\n\n00:06:11.958 --> 00:06:14.958\nso it has weather. So, it's very similar to some extent,\n\n00:06:14.958 --> 00:06:16.958\nand you can see some of the features on it,\n\n00:06:16.958 --> 00:06:17.958\nlike the Grand Canyon on Mars,\n\n00:06:17.958 --> 00:06:19.958\nor what we call the Grand Canyon on Mars.\n\n00:06:19.958 --> 00:06:24.958\nIt is like the Grand Canyon on Earth, except a hell of a lot larger.\n\n00:06:24.958 --> 00:06:27.958\nSo it's about the size, you know, of the United States.\n\n00:06:27.958 --> 00:06:32.958\nIt has volcanoes on it. And that's Mount Olympus on Mars,\n\n00:06:32.958 --> 00:06:36.958\nwhich is a kind of huge volcanic shield on that planet.\n\n00:06:36.958 --> 00:06:38.958\nAnd if you look at the height of it\n\n00:06:38.958 --> 00:06:42.958\nand you compare it to Mount Everest, you see, it'll give you\n\n00:06:42.958 --> 00:06:46.958\nan idea of how large that Mount Olympus, you know, is,\n\n00:06:46.958 --> 00:06:48.958\nrelative to Mount Everest.\n\n00:06:48.958 --> 00:06:51.958\nSo, it basically dwarfs, you know, Mount Everest here on Earth.\n\n00:06:51.958 --> 00:06:55.958\nSo, that gives you an idea of the tectonic events or volcanic events\n\n00:06:55.958 --> 00:06:57.958\nwhich have happened on that planet.\n\n00:06:57.958 --> 00:07:00.958\nRecently from one of our satellites, this shows that it's Earth-like --\n\n00:07:00.958 --> 00:07:04.958\nwe caught a landslide occurring as it was happening.\n\n00:07:04.958 --> 00:07:06.958\nSo it is a dynamic planet,\n\n00:07:06.958 --> 00:07:09.958\nand activity is going on as we speak today.\n\n00:07:09.958 --> 00:07:12.958\nAnd these Rovers, people wonder now, what are they doing today,\n\n00:07:12.958 --> 00:07:16.958\nso I thought I would show you a little bit what they are doing.\n\n00:07:16.958 --> 00:07:19.958\nThis is one very large crater. Geologists love craters,\n\n00:07:19.958 --> 00:07:21.958\nbecause craters are like digging a big hole in the ground\n\n00:07:21.958 --> 00:07:23.958\nwithout really working at it,\n\n00:07:23.958 --> 00:07:25.958\nand you can see what's below the surface.\n\n00:07:25.958 --> 00:07:27.958\nSo, this is called Victoria Crater,\n\n00:07:27.958 --> 00:07:29.958\nwhich is about a few football fields in size.\n\n00:07:29.958 --> 00:07:33.958\nAnd if you look at the top left, you see a little teeny dark dot.\n\n00:07:33.958 --> 00:07:35.958\nThis picture was taken from an orbiting satellite.\n\n00:07:35.958 --> 00:07:38.958\nIf I zoom on it, you can see: that's the Rover on the surface.\n\n00:07:38.958 --> 00:07:41.958\nSo, that was taken from orbit; we had the camera zoom on the surface,\n\n00:07:41.958 --> 00:07:44.958\nand we actually saw the Rover on the surface.\n\n00:07:44.958 --> 00:07:48.958\nAnd we actually used the combination of the satellite images\n\n00:07:48.958 --> 00:07:51.958\nand the Rover to actually conduct science,\n\n00:07:51.958 --> 00:07:53.958\nbecause we can observe large areas\n\n00:07:53.958 --> 00:07:55.958\nand then you can get those Rovers to move around\n\n00:07:55.958 --> 00:07:57.958\nand basically go to a certain location.\n\n00:07:57.958 --> 00:08:00.958\nSo, specifically what we are doing now is\n\n00:08:00.958 --> 00:08:02.958\nthat Rover is going down in that crater.\n\n00:08:02.958 --> 00:08:04.958\nAs I told you, geologists love craters.\n\n00:08:04.958 --> 00:08:07.958\nAnd the reason is, many of you went to the Grand Canyon,\n\n00:08:07.958 --> 00:08:11.958\nand you see in the wall of the Grand Canyon, you see these layers.\n\n00:08:11.958 --> 00:08:14.958\nAnd what these layers -- that's what the surface used to be\n\n00:08:14.958 --> 00:08:17.958\na million years ago, 10 million years ago,\n\n00:08:17.958 --> 00:08:19.958\n100 million years ago, and you get deposits on top of them.\n\n00:08:19.958 --> 00:08:22.958\nSo if you can read the layers it's like reading your book,\n\n00:08:22.958 --> 00:08:25.958\nand you can learn the history of what happened in the past\n\n00:08:25.958 --> 00:08:27.958\nin that location.\n\n00:08:27.958 --> 00:08:30.958\nSo what you are seeing here are the layers on the wall\n\n00:08:30.958 --> 00:08:34.958\nof that crater, and the Rover is going down now, measuring, you know,\n\n00:08:34.958 --> 00:08:36.958\nthe properties and analyzing the rocks\n\n00:08:36.958 --> 00:08:39.958\nas it's going down, you know, that canyon.\n\n00:08:39.958 --> 00:08:41.958\nNow, it's kind of a little bit of a challenge driving\n\n00:08:41.958 --> 00:08:43.958\ndown a slope like this.\n\n00:08:43.958 --> 00:08:45.958\nIf you were there you wouldn't do it yourself.\n\n00:08:45.958 --> 00:08:47.958\nBut we really made sure we tested those Rovers\n\n00:08:47.958 --> 00:08:50.958\nbefore we got them down -- or that Rover --\n\n00:08:50.958 --> 00:08:52.958\nand made sure that it's all working well.\n\n00:08:52.958 --> 00:08:55.958\nNow, when I came last time, shortly after the landing --\n\n00:08:55.958 --> 00:08:57.958\nI think it was, like, a hundred days after the landing --\n\n00:08:57.958 --> 00:08:59.958\nI told you I was surprised that those Rovers\n\n00:08:59.958 --> 00:09:02.958\nare lasting even a hundred days.\n\n00:09:02.958 --> 00:09:04.958\nWell, here we are four years later, and they're still working.\n\n00:09:04.958 --> 00:09:07.958\nNow you say, Charles, you are really lying to us, and so on,\n\n00:09:07.958 --> 00:09:09.958\nbut that's not true. We really believed they were going to last\n\n00:09:09.958 --> 00:09:13.958\n90 days or 100 days, because they are solar powered,\n\n00:09:13.958 --> 00:09:16.958\nand Mars is a dusty planet, so we expected the dust\n\n00:09:16.958 --> 00:09:19.958\nwould start accumulating on the surface, and after a while\n\n00:09:19.958 --> 00:09:22.958\nwe wouldn't have enough power, you know, to keep them warm.\n\n00:09:22.958 --> 00:09:24.958\nWell, I always say it's important that you are smart,\n\n00:09:24.958 --> 00:09:27.958\nbut every once in a while it's good to be lucky.\n\n00:09:27.958 --> 00:09:30.958\nAnd that's what we found out. It turned out that every once in a while\n\n00:09:30.958 --> 00:09:34.958\nthere are dust devils which come by on Mars, as you are seeing here,\n\n00:09:34.958 --> 00:09:37.958\nand when the dust devil comes over the Rover, it just cleans it up.\n\n00:09:37.958 --> 00:09:40.958\nIt is like a brand new car that you have,\n\n00:09:40.958 --> 00:09:43.958\nand that's literally why they have lasted so long.\n\n00:09:43.958 --> 00:09:45.958\nAnd now we designed them reasonably well,\n\n00:09:45.958 --> 00:09:49.958\nbut that's exactly why they are lasting that long\n\n00:09:49.958 --> 00:09:51.958\nand still providing all the science data.\n\n00:09:51.958 --> 00:09:54.958\nNow, the two Rovers, each one of them is, kind of, getting old.\n\n00:09:54.958 --> 00:09:57.958\nYou know, one of them, one of the wheels is stuck, is not working,\n\n00:09:57.958 --> 00:09:59.958\none of the front wheels, so what we are doing,\n\n00:09:59.958 --> 00:10:01.958\nwe are driving it backwards.\n\n00:10:01.958 --> 00:10:03.958\nAnd the other one has arthritis of the shoulder joint, you know,\n\n00:10:03.958 --> 00:10:06.958\nit's not working very well, so it's walking like this,\n\n00:10:06.958 --> 00:10:08.958\nand we can move the arm, you know, that way.\n\n00:10:08.958 --> 00:10:11.958\nBut still they are producing a lot of scientific data.\n\n00:10:11.958 --> 00:10:14.958\nNow, during that whole period, a number of people got excited,\n\n00:10:14.958 --> 00:10:18.958\nyou know, outside the science community about these Rovers,\n\n00:10:18.958 --> 00:10:21.958\nso I thought I'd show you a video just to give you a reflection\n\n00:10:21.958 --> 00:10:24.958\nabout how these Rovers are being viewed by people\n\n00:10:24.958 --> 00:10:27.958\nother than the science community.\n\n00:10:27.958 --> 00:10:29.958\nSo let me go on the next short video.\n\n00:10:29.958 --> 00:10:34.958\nBy the way, this video is pretty accurate of how the landing took place, you know,\n\n00:10:34.958 --> 00:10:35.958\nabout four years ago.\n\n00:10:35.958 --> 00:10:37.958\nVideo: Okay, we have parachute aligned.\n\n00:10:37.958 --> 00:10:40.958\nOkay, deploy the airbags. Open.\n\n00:10:41.958 --> 00:10:44.958\nCamera. We have a picture right now.\n\n00:10:46.958 --> 00:10:48.958\nYeah!\n\n00:10:48.958 --> 00:10:53.958\nCE: That's about what happened in the Houston operation room. It's exactly like this.\n\n00:10:53.958 --> 00:10:58.958\nVideo: Now, if there is life, the Dutch will find it.\n\n00:11:04.958 --> 00:11:06.958\nWhat is he doing?\n\n00:11:07.958 --> 00:11:09.958\nWhat is that?\n\n00:11:19.958 --> 00:11:20.958\nCE: Not too bad.\n\n00:11:29.958 --> 00:11:32.958\nSo anyway, let me continue on showing you a little bit\n\n00:11:32.958 --> 00:11:33.958\nabout the beauty of that planet.\n\n00:11:33.958 --> 00:11:36.958\nAs I said earlier, it looked very much like Earth,\n\n00:11:36.958 --> 00:11:38.958\nso you see sand dunes.\n\n00:11:38.958 --> 00:11:40.958\nIt looks like I could have told you these are pictures taken\n\n00:11:40.958 --> 00:11:43.958\nfrom the Sahara Desert or somewhere, and you'd have believed me,\n\n00:11:43.958 --> 00:11:44.958\nbut these are pictures taken from Mars.\n\n00:11:44.958 --> 00:11:47.958\nBut one area which is particularly intriguing for us\n\n00:11:47.958 --> 00:11:50.958\nis the northern region, you know, of Mars, close to the North Pole,\n\n00:11:50.958 --> 00:11:53.958\nbecause we see ice caps, and we see the ice caps shrinking\n\n00:11:53.958 --> 00:11:57.958\nand expanding, so it's very much like you have in northern Canada.\n\n00:11:57.958 --> 00:12:00.958\nAnd we wanted to find out -- and we see all kinds of glacial features on it.\n\n00:12:00.958 --> 00:12:02.958\nSo, we wanted to find out, actually,\n\n00:12:02.958 --> 00:12:06.958\nwhat is that ice made of, and could that have embedded in it\n\n00:12:06.958 --> 00:12:09.958\nsome organic, you know, material.\n\n00:12:09.958 --> 00:12:11.958\nSo we have a spacecraft which is heading towards Mars,\n\n00:12:11.958 --> 00:12:14.958\ncalled Phoenix, and that spacecraft will land\n\n00:12:14.958 --> 00:12:18.958\n17 days, seven hours and 20 seconds from now,\n\n00:12:18.958 --> 00:12:20.958\nso you can adjust your watch.\n\n00:12:20.958 --> 00:12:24.958\nSo it's on May 25 around just before five o'clock our time here\n\n00:12:24.958 --> 00:12:27.958\non the West Coast, actually we will be landing on another planet.\n\n00:12:27.958 --> 00:12:31.958\nAnd as you can see, this is a picture of the spacecraft put on Mars,\n\n00:12:31.958 --> 00:12:34.958\nbut I thought that just in case you're going to miss that show, you know,\n\n00:12:34.958 --> 00:12:36.958\nin 17 days, I'll show you, kind of,\n\n00:12:36.958 --> 00:12:38.958\na little bit of what's going to happen.\n\n00:12:38.958 --> 00:12:41.958\nVideo: That's what we call the seven minutes of terror.\n\n00:12:55.958 --> 00:12:57.958\nSo the plan is to dig in the soil and take samples\n\n00:12:57.958 --> 00:13:00.958\nthat we put them in an oven and actually heat them\n\n00:13:00.958 --> 00:13:02.958\nand look what gases will come from it.\n\n00:13:02.958 --> 00:13:05.958\nSo this was launched about nine months ago.\n\n00:13:08.958 --> 00:13:12.958\nWe'll be coming in at 12,000 miles per hour, and in seven minutes\n\n00:13:12.958 --> 00:13:15.958\nwe have to stop and touch the surface very softly\n\n00:13:15.958 --> 00:13:17.958\nso we don't break that lander.\n\n00:13:33.958 --> 00:13:35.958\nBen Cichy: Phoenix is the first Mars Scout mission.\n\n00:13:35.958 --> 00:13:37.958\nIt's the first mission that's going to try to land\n\n00:13:37.958 --> 00:13:39.958\nnear the North Pole of Mars, and it's the first mission\n\n00:13:39.958 --> 00:13:42.958\nthat's actually going to try and reach out and touch water\n\n00:13:42.958 --> 00:13:44.958\non the surface of another planet.\n\n00:13:44.958 --> 00:13:47.958\nLynn Craig: Where there tends to be water, at least on Earth,\n\n00:13:47.958 --> 00:13:50.958\nthere tends to be life, and so it's potentially a place\n\n00:13:50.958 --> 00:13:54.958\nwhere life could have existed on the planet in the past.\n\n00:13:58.958 --> 00:14:01.958\nErik Bailey: The main purpose of EDL is to take a spacecraft that is traveling\n\n00:14:01.958 --> 00:14:07.958\nat 12,500 miles an hour and bring it to a screeching halt\n\n00:14:07.958 --> 00:14:10.958\nin a soft way in a very short amount of time.\n\n00:14:11.958 --> 00:14:13.958\nBC: We enter the Martian atmosphere.\n\n00:14:13.958 --> 00:14:15.958\nWe're 70 miles above the surface of Mars.\n\n00:14:15.958 --> 00:14:18.958\nAnd our lander is safely tucked inside what we call an aeroshell.\n\n00:14:18.958 --> 00:14:20.958\nEB: Looks kind of like an ice cream cone, more or less.\n\n00:14:20.958 --> 00:14:22.958\nBC: And on the front of it is this heat shield,\n\n00:14:22.958 --> 00:14:25.958\nthis saucer-looking thing that has about a half-inch\n\n00:14:25.958 --> 00:14:27.958\nof essentially what's cork on the front of it,\n\n00:14:27.958 --> 00:14:28.958\nwhich is our heat shield.\n\n00:14:28.958 --> 00:14:30.958\nNow, this is really special cork,\n\n00:14:30.958 --> 00:14:32.958\nand this cork is what's going to protect us\n\n00:14:32.958 --> 00:14:35.958\nfrom the violent atmospheric entry that we're about to experience.\n\n00:14:36.958 --> 00:14:39.958\nRob Grover: Friction really starts to build up on the spacecraft,\n\n00:14:39.958 --> 00:14:42.958\nand we use the friction when it's flying through the atmosphere\n\n00:14:42.958 --> 00:14:44.958\nto our advantage to slow us down.\n\n00:14:45.958 --> 00:14:48.958\nBC: From this point, we're going to decelerate from 12,500 miles an hour\n\n00:14:50.958 --> 00:14:52.958\ndown to 900 miles an hour.\n\n00:14:52.958 --> 00:14:54.958\nEB: The outside can get almost as hot as the surface of the Sun.\n\n00:14:54.958 --> 00:14:58.958\nRG: The temperature of the heat shield can reach 2,600 degrees Fahrenheit.\n\n00:15:00.958 --> 00:15:02.958\nEB: The inside doesn't get very hot.\n\n00:15:02.958 --> 00:15:05.958\nIt probably gets about room temperature.\n\n00:15:05.958 --> 00:15:08.958\nRichard Kornfeld: There is this window of opportunity\n\n00:15:08.958 --> 00:15:10.958\nwithin which we can deploy the parachute.\n\n00:15:11.958 --> 00:15:14.958\nEB: If you fire the 'chute too early, the parachute itself could fail.\n\n00:15:14.958 --> 00:15:17.958\nThe fabric and the stitching could just pull apart.\n\n00:15:19.958 --> 00:15:21.958\nAnd that would be bad.\n\n00:15:21.958 --> 00:15:24.958\nBC: In the first 15 seconds after we deploy the parachute,\n\n00:15:24.958 --> 00:15:26.958\nwe'll decelerate from 900 miles an hour\n\n00:15:26.958 --> 00:15:29.958\nto a relatively slow 250 miles an hour.\n\n00:15:29.958 --> 00:15:31.958\nWe no longer need the heat shield to protect us\n\n00:15:31.958 --> 00:15:35.958\nfrom the force of atmospheric entry, so we jettison the heat shield,\n\n00:15:35.958 --> 00:15:38.958\nexposing for the first time our lander to the atmosphere of Mars.\n\n00:15:38.958 --> 00:15:42.958\nLC: After the heat shield has been jettisoned and the legs are deployed,\n\n00:15:42.958 --> 00:15:46.958\nthe next step is to have the radar system begin to detect\n\n00:15:46.958 --> 00:15:50.958\nhow far Phoenix really is from the ground.\n\n00:15:50.958 --> 00:15:53.958\nBC: We've lost 99 percent of our entry velocity.\n\n00:15:53.958 --> 00:15:56.958\nSo, we're 99 percent of the way to where we want to be.\n\n00:15:56.958 --> 00:15:59.958\nBut that last one percent, as it always seems to be, is the tricky part.\n\n00:15:59.958 --> 00:16:02.958\nEB: Now the spacecraft actually has to decide\n\n00:16:02.958 --> 00:16:04.958\nwhen it's going to get rid of its parachute.\n\n00:16:04.958 --> 00:16:06.958\nBC: We separate from the lander going 125 miles an hour\n\n00:16:06.958 --> 00:16:10.958\nat roughly a kilometer above the surface of Mars: 3,200 feet.\n\n00:16:10.958 --> 00:16:12.958\nThat's like taking two Empire State Buildings\n\n00:16:12.958 --> 00:16:13.958\nand stacking them on top of one another.\n\n00:16:13.958 --> 00:16:15.958\nEB: That's when we separate from the back shell,\n\n00:16:15.958 --> 00:16:17.958\nand we're now in free-fall.\n\n00:16:19.958 --> 00:16:21.958\nIt's a very scary moment; a lot has to happen\n\n00:16:21.958 --> 00:16:23.958\nin a very short amount of time.\n\n00:16:25.958 --> 00:16:27.958\nLC: So it's in a free-fall,\n\n00:16:27.958 --> 00:16:31.958\nbut it's also trying to use all of its actuators\n\n00:16:31.958 --> 00:16:34.958\nto make sure that it's in the right position to land.\n\n00:16:34.958 --> 00:16:38.958\nEB: And then it has to light up its engines, right itself,\n\n00:16:38.958 --> 00:16:43.958\nand then slowly slow itself down and touch down on the ground safely.\n\n00:16:48.958 --> 00:16:52.958\nBC: Earth and Mars are so far apart that it takes over ten minutes\n\n00:16:52.958 --> 00:16:54.958\nfor a signal from Mars to get to Earth.\n\n00:16:54.958 --> 00:16:57.958\nAnd EDL itself is all over in a matter of seven minutes.\n\n00:16:57.958 --> 00:17:00.958\nSo by the time you even hear from the lander that EDL has started\n\n00:17:00.958 --> 00:17:01.958\nit'll already be over.\n\n00:17:01.958 --> 00:17:04.958\nEB: We have to build large amounts of autonomy into the spacecraft\n\n00:17:04.958 --> 00:17:07.958\nso that it can land itself safely.\n\n00:17:07.958 --> 00:17:09.958\nBC: EDL is this immense, technically challenging problem.\n\n00:17:09.958 --> 00:17:12.958\nIt's about getting a spacecraft that's hurtling through deep space\n\n00:17:12.958 --> 00:17:14.958\nand using all this bag of tricks to somehow figure out\n\n00:17:14.958 --> 00:17:17.958\nhow to get it down to the surface of Mars at zero miles an hour.\n\n00:17:17.958 --> 00:17:20.958\nIt's this immensely exciting and challenging problem.\n\n00:17:28.958 --> 00:17:32.958\nCE: Hopefully it all will happen the way you saw it in here.\n\n00:17:32.958 --> 00:17:34.958\nSo it will be a very tense moment, you know,\n\n00:17:34.958 --> 00:17:38.958\nas we are watching that spacecraft landing on another planet.\n\n00:17:38.958 --> 00:17:40.958\nSo now let me talk about the next things that we are doing.\n\n00:17:40.958 --> 00:17:43.958\nSo we are in the process, as we speak, of actually designing\n\n00:17:43.958 --> 00:17:45.958\nthe next Rover that we are going to be sending to Mars.\n\n00:17:45.958 --> 00:17:47.958\nSo I thought I would go a little bit and tell you, kind of,\n\n00:17:47.958 --> 00:17:49.958\nthe steps we go through.\n\n00:17:49.958 --> 00:17:52.958\nIt's very similar to what you do when you design your product.\n\n00:17:52.958 --> 00:17:54.958\nAs you saw a little bit earlier,\n\n00:17:54.958 --> 00:17:55.958\nwhen we were doing the Phoenix one,\n\n00:17:55.958 --> 00:17:58.958\nwe have to take into account the heat that we are going to be facing.\n\n00:17:58.958 --> 00:18:00.958\nSo we have to study all kinds of different materials,\n\n00:18:00.958 --> 00:18:02.958\nthe shape that we want to do.\n\n00:18:02.958 --> 00:18:04.958\nIn general we don't try to please the customer here.\n\n00:18:04.958 --> 00:18:07.958\nWhat we want to do is to make sure we have an effective, you know,\n\n00:18:07.958 --> 00:18:09.958\nan efficient kind of machine.\n\n00:18:09.958 --> 00:18:11.958\nFirst we start by we want to have our employees\n\n00:18:11.958 --> 00:18:13.958\nto be as imaginative as they can.\n\n00:18:13.958 --> 00:18:17.958\nAnd we really love being close to the art center, because we have,\n\n00:18:17.958 --> 00:18:19.958\nas a matter of fact, one of the alumni from the art center,\n\n00:18:19.958 --> 00:18:21.958\nEric Nyquist, had put a series of displays,\n\n00:18:21.958 --> 00:18:23.958\nfar-out displays, you know,\n\n00:18:23.958 --> 00:18:26.958\nin our what we call mission design or spacecraft design room,\n\n00:18:26.958 --> 00:18:28.958\njust to get people to think wildly about things.\n\n00:18:28.958 --> 00:18:31.958\nWe have a bunch of Legos. So, as I said,\n\n00:18:31.958 --> 00:18:34.958\nthis is a playground for adults, where they sit down and try to play\n\n00:18:34.958 --> 00:18:38.958\nwith different shapes and different designs.\n\n00:18:38.958 --> 00:18:41.958\nThen we get a little bit more serious, so we have\n\n00:18:41.958 --> 00:18:44.958\nwhat we call our CAD/CAMs and all the engineers who are involved,\n\n00:18:44.958 --> 00:18:47.958\nor scientists who are involved, who know about thermal properties,\n\n00:18:47.958 --> 00:18:50.958\nknow about design, know about atmospheric interaction, parachutes,\n\n00:18:50.958 --> 00:18:53.958\nall of these things, which they work in a team effort\n\n00:18:53.958 --> 00:18:57.958\nand actually design a spacecraft in a computer to some extent,\n\n00:18:57.958 --> 00:19:00.958\nso to see, does that meet the requirement that we need.\n\n00:19:00.958 --> 00:19:02.958\nOn the right, also, we have to take into account\n\n00:19:02.958 --> 00:19:04.958\nthe environment of the planet where we are going.\n\n00:19:04.958 --> 00:19:07.958\nIf you are going to Jupiter, you have a very high-radiation,\n\n00:19:07.958 --> 00:19:09.958\nyou know, environment. It's about the same radiation environment\n\n00:19:09.958 --> 00:19:12.958\nclose by Jupiter as inside a nuclear reactor.\n\n00:19:12.958 --> 00:19:15.958\nSo just imagine: you take your P.C. and throw it into a nuclear reactor\n\n00:19:15.958 --> 00:19:17.958\nand it still has to work.\n\n00:19:17.958 --> 00:19:19.958\nSo these are kind of some of the little challenges, you know,\n\n00:19:19.958 --> 00:19:22.958\nthat we have to face.\n\n00:19:22.958 --> 00:19:24.958\nIf we are doing entry, we have to do tests of parachutes.\n\n00:19:24.958 --> 00:19:27.958\nYou saw in the video a parachute breaking. That would be a bad day,\n\n00:19:27.958 --> 00:19:30.958\nyou know, if that happened, so we have to test,\n\n00:19:30.958 --> 00:19:33.958\nbecause we are deploying this parachute at supersonic speeds.\n\n00:19:33.958 --> 00:19:36.958\nWe are coming at extremely high speeds, and we are deploying them\n\n00:19:36.958 --> 00:19:38.958\nto slow us down. So we have to do all kinds of tests.\n\n00:19:38.958 --> 00:19:41.958\nTo give you an idea of the size, you know, of that parachute\n\n00:19:41.958 --> 00:19:43.958\nrelative to the people standing there.\n\n00:19:43.958 --> 00:19:47.958\nNext step, we go and actually build some kind of test models\n\n00:19:47.958 --> 00:19:50.958\nand actually test them, you know, in the lab at JPL,\n\n00:19:50.958 --> 00:19:52.958\nin what we call our Mars Yard.\n\n00:19:52.958 --> 00:19:54.958\nWe kick them, we hit them, we drop them,\n\n00:19:54.958 --> 00:19:58.958\njust to make sure we understand how, where would they break.\n\n00:19:58.958 --> 00:20:04.958\nAnd then we back off, you know, from that point.\n\n00:20:04.958 --> 00:20:08.958\nAnd then we actually do the actual building and the flight.\n\n00:20:08.958 --> 00:20:12.958\nAnd this next Rover that we're flying is about the size of a car.\n\n00:20:12.958 --> 00:20:14.958\nThat big shield that you see outside,\n\n00:20:14.958 --> 00:20:16.958\nthat's a heat shield which is going to protect it.\n\n00:20:16.958 --> 00:20:19.958\nAnd that will be basically built over the next year,\n\n00:20:19.958 --> 00:20:22.958\nand it will be launched June a year from now.\n\n00:20:22.958 --> 00:20:25.958\nNow, in that case, because it was a very big Rover,\n\n00:20:25.958 --> 00:20:27.958\nwe couldn't use airbags.\n\n00:20:27.958 --> 00:20:29.958\nAnd I know many of you, kind of, last time afterwards said\n\n00:20:29.958 --> 00:20:32.958\nwell, that was a cool thing to have -- those airbags.\n\n00:20:32.958 --> 00:20:35.958\nUnfortunately this Rover is, like, ten times the size of the, you know,\n\n00:20:35.958 --> 00:20:38.958\nmass-wise, of the other Rover, or three times the mass.\n\n00:20:38.958 --> 00:20:40.958\nSo we can't use airbags. So we have to come up with\n\n00:20:40.958 --> 00:20:42.958\nanother ingenious idea of how do we land it.\n\n00:20:42.958 --> 00:20:46.958\nAnd we didn't want to take it propulsively all the way to the surface\n\n00:20:46.958 --> 00:20:48.958\nbecause we didn't want to contaminate the surface;\n\n00:20:48.958 --> 00:20:51.958\nwe wanted the Rover to immediately land on its legs.\n\n00:20:51.958 --> 00:20:53.958\nSo we came up with this ingenious idea,\n\n00:20:53.958 --> 00:20:57.958\nwhich is used here on Earth for helicopters.\n\n00:20:57.958 --> 00:21:01.958\nActually, the lander will come down to about 100 feet and hover\n\n00:21:01.958 --> 00:21:04.958\nabove that surface for 100 feet, and then we have a sky crane\n\n00:21:04.958 --> 00:21:06.958\nwhich will take that Rover and land it down on the surface.\n\n00:21:06.958 --> 00:21:09.958\nHopefully it all will work, you know, it will work that way.\n\n00:21:09.958 --> 00:21:12.958\nAnd that Rover will be more kind of like a chemist.\n\n00:21:12.958 --> 00:21:15.958\nWhat we are going to be doing with that Rover as it drives around,\n\n00:21:15.958 --> 00:21:18.958\nit's going to go and analyze the chemical composition of rocks.\n\n00:21:18.958 --> 00:21:21.958\nSo it will have an arm which will take samples,\n\n00:21:21.958 --> 00:21:23.958\nput them in an oven, crush and analyze them.\n\n00:21:23.958 --> 00:21:26.958\nBut also, if there is something that we cannot reach\n\n00:21:26.958 --> 00:21:29.958\nbecause it is too high on a cliff, we have a little laser system\n\n00:21:29.958 --> 00:21:32.958\nwhich will actually zap the rock, evaporate some of it,\n\n00:21:32.958 --> 00:21:34.958\nand actually analyze what's coming from that rock.\n\n00:21:34.958 --> 00:21:37.958\nSo it's a little bit like \"Star Wars,\" you know, but it's real.\n\n00:21:37.958 --> 00:21:39.958\nIt's real stuff.\n\n00:21:39.958 --> 00:21:41.958\nAnd also to help you, to help the community\n\n00:21:41.958 --> 00:21:45.958\nso you can do ads on that Rover, we are going to train that Rover\n\n00:21:45.958 --> 00:21:48.958\nto actually in addition to do this, to actually serve cocktails,\n\n00:21:48.958 --> 00:21:50.958\nyou know, also on Mars.\n\n00:21:50.958 --> 00:21:53.958\nSo that's kind of giving you an idea of the kind of, you know,\n\n00:21:53.958 --> 00:21:54.958\nfun things we are doing on Mars.\n\n00:21:54.958 --> 00:21:57.958\nI thought I'd go to \"The Lord of the Rings\" now\n\n00:21:57.958 --> 00:21:59.958\nand show you some of the things we have there.\n\n00:21:59.958 --> 00:22:02.958\nNow, \"The Lord of the Rings\" has two things played through it.\n\n00:22:02.958 --> 00:22:05.958\nOne, it's a very attractive planet --\n\n00:22:05.958 --> 00:22:07.958\nit just has the beauty of the rings and so on.\n\n00:22:07.958 --> 00:22:10.958\nBut for scientists, also the rings have a special meaning,\n\n00:22:10.958 --> 00:22:13.958\nbecause we believe they represent, on a small scale,\n\n00:22:13.958 --> 00:22:16.958\nhow the Solar System actually formed.\n\n00:22:16.958 --> 00:22:20.958\nSome of the scientists believe that the way the Solar System formed,\n\n00:22:20.958 --> 00:22:24.958\nthat the Sun when it collapsed and actually created the Sun,\n\n00:22:24.958 --> 00:22:26.958\na lot of the dust around it created rings\n\n00:22:26.958 --> 00:22:29.958\nand then the particles in those rings accumulated together,\n\n00:22:29.958 --> 00:22:32.958\nand they formed bigger rocks, and then that's how the planets,\n\n00:22:32.958 --> 00:22:33.958\nyou know, were formed.\n\n00:22:33.958 --> 00:22:36.958\nSo, the idea is, by watching Saturn we're actually watching\n\n00:22:36.958 --> 00:22:39.958\nour solar system in real time being formed on a smaller scale,\n\n00:22:39.958 --> 00:22:41.958\nso it's like a test bed for it.\n\n00:22:41.958 --> 00:22:43.958\nSo, let me show you a little bit\n\n00:22:43.958 --> 00:22:46.958\non what that Saturnian system looks like.\n\n00:22:46.958 --> 00:22:49.958\nFirst, I'm going to fly you over the rings.\n\n00:22:49.958 --> 00:22:51.958\nBy the way, all of this is real stuff.\n\n00:22:51.958 --> 00:22:53.958\nThis is not animation or anything like this.\n\n00:22:53.958 --> 00:22:55.958\nThis is actually taken from the satellite\n\n00:22:55.958 --> 00:22:58.958\nthat we have in orbit around Saturn, the Cassini.\n\n00:22:58.958 --> 00:23:01.958\nAnd you see the amount of detail that is in those rings,\n\n00:23:01.958 --> 00:23:02.958\nwhich are the particles.\n\n00:23:02.958 --> 00:23:05.958\nSome of them are agglomerating together to form larger particles.\n\n00:23:05.958 --> 00:23:09.958\nSo that's why you have these gaps, is because a small satellite, you know,\n\n00:23:09.958 --> 00:23:12.958\nis being formed in that location.\n\n00:23:12.958 --> 00:23:14.958\nNow, you think that those rings are very large objects.\n\n00:23:14.958 --> 00:23:16.958\nYes, they are very large in one dimension;\n\n00:23:16.958 --> 00:23:19.958\nin the other dimension they are paper thin. Very, very thin.\n\n00:23:19.958 --> 00:23:23.958\nWhat you are seeing here is the shadow of the ring on Saturn itself.\n\n00:23:23.958 --> 00:23:24.958\nAnd that's one of the satellites\n\n00:23:24.958 --> 00:23:27.958\nwhich was actually formed on that one.\n\n00:23:27.958 --> 00:23:29.958\nSo, think about it as a paper-thin,\n\n00:23:29.958 --> 00:23:34.958\nhuge area of many hundreds of thousands of miles, which is rotating.\n\n00:23:34.958 --> 00:23:37.958\nAnd we have a wide variety of kind of satellites which will form,\n\n00:23:37.958 --> 00:23:40.958\neach one looking very different and very odd, and that keeps\n\n00:23:40.958 --> 00:23:43.958\nscientists busy for tens of years trying to explain this,\n\n00:23:43.958 --> 00:23:46.958\nand telling NASA we need more money so we can explain\n\n00:23:46.958 --> 00:23:48.958\nwhat these things look like, or why they formed that way.\n\n00:23:48.958 --> 00:23:51.958\nWell, there were two satellites which were particularly interesting.\n\n00:23:51.958 --> 00:23:53.958\nOne of them is called Enceladus.\n\n00:23:53.958 --> 00:23:56.958\nIt's a satellite which was all made of ice,\n\n00:23:56.958 --> 00:23:58.958\nand we measured it from orbit. Made of ice.\n\n00:23:58.958 --> 00:24:00.958\nBut there was something bizarre about it.\n\n00:24:00.958 --> 00:24:04.958\nIf you look at these stripes in here, what we call tiger stripes,\n\n00:24:04.958 --> 00:24:06.958\nwhen we flew over them, all of a sudden we saw\n\n00:24:06.958 --> 00:24:09.958\nan increase in the temperature, which said that those stripes\n\n00:24:09.958 --> 00:24:11.958\nare warmer than the rest of the planet.\n\n00:24:11.958 --> 00:24:16.958\nSo as we flew by away from it, we looked back. And guess what?\n\n00:24:16.958 --> 00:24:18.958\nWe saw geysers coming out.\n\n00:24:18.958 --> 00:24:20.958\nSo this is a Yellowstone, you know, of Saturn.\n\n00:24:20.958 --> 00:24:24.958\nWe are seeing geysers of ice which are coming out of that planet,\n\n00:24:24.958 --> 00:24:26.958\nwhich indicate that most likely there is an ocean, you know,\n\n00:24:26.958 --> 00:24:28.958\nbelow the surface.\n\n00:24:28.958 --> 00:24:31.958\nAnd somehow, through some dynamic effect, we're having these geysers\n\n00:24:31.958 --> 00:24:34.958\nwhich are being, you know, emitted from it.\n\n00:24:34.958 --> 00:24:36.958\nAnd the reason I showed the little arrow there,\n\n00:24:36.958 --> 00:24:38.958\nI think that should say 30 miles,\n\n00:24:38.958 --> 00:24:41.958\nwe decided a few months ago to actually fly the spacecraft\n\n00:24:41.958 --> 00:24:43.958\nthrough the plume of that geyser\n\n00:24:43.958 --> 00:24:48.958\nso we can actually measure the material that it is made of.\n\n00:24:48.958 --> 00:24:51.958\nThat was [unclear] also -- you know, because we were worried\n\n00:24:51.958 --> 00:24:53.958\nabout the risk of it, but it worked pretty well.\n\n00:24:53.958 --> 00:24:56.958\nWe flew at the top of it, and we found that there is a fair amount of\n\n00:24:56.958 --> 00:25:00.958\norganic material which is being emitted in combination with the ice.\n\n00:25:00.958 --> 00:25:04.958\nAnd over the next few years, as we keep orbiting, you know, Saturn,\n\n00:25:04.958 --> 00:25:07.958\nwe are planning to get closer and closer down to the surface\n\n00:25:07.958 --> 00:25:09.958\nand make more accurate measurements.\n\n00:25:09.958 --> 00:25:11.958\nNow, another satellite also attracted a lot of attention,\n\n00:25:11.958 --> 00:25:14.958\nand that's Titan. And the reason Titan is particularly interesting,\n\n00:25:14.958 --> 00:25:19.958\nit's a satellite bigger than our moon, and it has an atmosphere.\n\n00:25:19.958 --> 00:25:22.958\nAnd that atmosphere is very -- as dense as our own atmosphere.\n\n00:25:22.958 --> 00:25:25.958\nSo if you were on Titan, you would feel the same pressure\n\n00:25:25.958 --> 00:25:29.958\nthat you feel in here. Except it's a lot colder,\n\n00:25:29.958 --> 00:25:32.958\nand that atmosphere is heavily made of methane.\n\n00:25:32.958 --> 00:25:35.958\nNow, methane gets people all excited, because it's organic material,\n\n00:25:35.958 --> 00:25:37.958\nso immediately people start thinking,\n\n00:25:37.958 --> 00:25:40.958\ncould life have evolved in that location,\n\n00:25:40.958 --> 00:25:42.958\nwhen you have a lot of organic material.\n\n00:25:42.958 --> 00:25:46.958\nSo people believe now that Titan is most likely what we call\n\n00:25:46.958 --> 00:25:52.958\na pre-biotic planet, because it's so cold organic material did not get\n\n00:25:52.958 --> 00:25:54.958\nto the stage of becoming biological material,\n\n00:25:54.958 --> 00:25:56.958\nand therefore life could have evolved on it.\n\n00:25:56.958 --> 00:26:00.958\nSo it could be Earth, frozen three billion years ago\n\n00:26:00.958 --> 00:26:02.958\nbefore life actually started on it.\n\n00:26:02.958 --> 00:26:05.958\nSo that's getting a lot of interest, and to show you some example\n\n00:26:05.958 --> 00:26:09.958\nof what we did in there, we actually dropped a probe,\n\n00:26:09.958 --> 00:26:11.958\nwhich was developed by our colleagues in Europe, we dropped a probe\n\n00:26:11.958 --> 00:26:14.958\nas we were orbiting Saturn.\n\n00:26:14.958 --> 00:26:16.958\nWe dropped a probe in the atmosphere of Titan.\n\n00:26:16.958 --> 00:26:19.958\nAnd this is a picture of an area as we were coming down.\n\n00:26:19.958 --> 00:26:21.958\nJust looked like the coast of California for me.\n\n00:26:21.958 --> 00:26:24.958\nYou see the rivers which are coming along the coast,\n\n00:26:24.958 --> 00:26:26.958\nand you see that white area which looks like Catalina Island,\n\n00:26:26.958 --> 00:26:28.958\nand that looks like an ocean.\n\n00:26:28.958 --> 00:26:31.958\nAnd then with an instrument we have on board, a radar instrument,\n\n00:26:31.958 --> 00:26:34.958\nwe found there are lakes like the Great Lakes in here,\n\n00:26:34.958 --> 00:26:35.958\nso it looks very much like Earth.\n\n00:26:35.958 --> 00:26:39.958\nIt looks like there are rivers on it, there are oceans or lakes,\n\n00:26:39.958 --> 00:26:42.958\nwe know there are clouds. We think it's raining also on it.\n\n00:26:42.958 --> 00:26:44.958\nSo it's very much like the cycle on Earth except\n\n00:26:44.958 --> 00:26:47.958\nbecause it's so cold, it could not be water, you know,\n\n00:26:47.958 --> 00:26:49.958\nbecause water would have frozen.\n\n00:26:49.958 --> 00:26:51.958\nWhat it turned out, that all that we are seeing, all this liquid,\n\n00:26:51.958 --> 00:26:54.958\n[is made of] hydrocarbon and ethane and methane,\n\n00:26:54.958 --> 00:26:56.958\nsimilar to what you put in your car.\n\n00:26:56.958 --> 00:27:00.958\nSo here we have a cycle of a planet which is like our Earth,\n\n00:27:00.958 --> 00:27:04.958\nbut is all made of ethane and methane and organic material.\n\n00:27:04.958 --> 00:27:07.958\nSo if you were on Mars -- sorry, on Titan,\n\n00:27:07.958 --> 00:27:09.958\nyou don't have to worry about four-dollar gasoline.\n\n00:27:09.958 --> 00:27:11.958\nYou just drive to the nearest lake, stick your hose in it,\n\n00:27:11.958 --> 00:27:14.958\nand you've got your car filled up.\n\n00:27:14.958 --> 00:27:16.958\nOn the other hand, if you light a match\n\n00:27:16.958 --> 00:27:20.958\nthe whole planet will blow up.\n\n00:27:20.958 --> 00:27:23.958\nSo in closing, I said I want to close by a couple of pictures.\n\n00:27:23.958 --> 00:27:26.958\nAnd just to kind of put us in perspective,\n\n00:27:26.958 --> 00:27:29.958\nthis is a picture of Saturn taken with a spacecraft\n\n00:27:29.958 --> 00:27:31.958\nfrom behind Saturn, looking towards the Sun.\n\n00:27:31.958 --> 00:27:35.958\nThe Sun is behind Saturn, so we see what we call \"forward scattering,\"\n\n00:27:35.958 --> 00:27:38.958\nso it highlights all the rings. And I'm going to zoom.\n\n00:27:38.958 --> 00:27:41.958\nThere is a -- I'm not sure you can see it very well,\n\n00:27:41.958 --> 00:27:43.958\nbut on the top left, around 10 o'clock,\n\n00:27:43.958 --> 00:27:46.958\nthere is a little teeny dot, and that's Earth.\n\n00:27:46.958 --> 00:27:50.958\nYou barely can see ourselves. So what I did, I thought I'd zoom on it.\n\n00:27:50.958 --> 00:27:54.958\nSo as you zoom in, you know, you can see Earth, you know,\n\n00:27:54.958 --> 00:27:57.958\njust in the middle here. So we zoomed all the way on the art center.\n\n00:28:01.958 --> 00:28:03.958\nSo thank you very much."}, {"title": "Tidying up art", "duration": "957", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/ursus_wehrli_tidies_up_art", "transcript": "My name is Ursus Wehrli, and I would like to talk to you this morning about my project, Tidying Up Art. First of all \u2014 any questions so far? First of all, I have to say I'm not from around here. I'm from a completely different cultural area, maybe you noticed? I mean, I'm wearing a tie, first. And then secondly, I'm a little bit nervous because I'm speaking in a foreign language, and I want to apologize in advance, for any mistakes I might make. Because I'm from Switzerland, and I just don't hope you think this is Swiss German I'm speaking now here. This is just what it sounds like if we Swiss try to speak American. But don't worry \u2014 I don't have trouble with English, as such. I mean, it's not my problem, it's your language after all. (Laughter) I am fine. After this presentation here at TED, I can simply go back to Switzerland, and you have to go on talking like this all the time. (Laughter)So I've been asked by the organizers to read from my book. It's called \"Tidying Up Art\" and it's, as you can see, it's more or less a picture book. So the reading would be over very quickly. But since I'm here at TED, I decided to hold my talk here in a more modern way, in the spirit of TED here, and I managed to do some slides here for you. I'd like to show them around so we can just, you know \u2014 (Laughter) Actually, I managed to prepare for you some enlarged pictures \u2014 even better.So Tidying Up Art, I mean, I have to say, that's a relatively new term. You won't be familiar with it. I mean, it's a hobby of mine that I've been indulging in for the last few years, and it all started out with this picture of the American artist, Donald Baechler I had hanging at home. I had to look at it every day and after a while I just couldn't stand the mess anymore this guy was looking at all day long. Yeah, I kind of felt sorry for him. And it seemed to me even he felt really bad facing these unorganized red squares day after day. So I decided to give him a little support, and brought some order into neatly stacking the blocks on top of each other. (Laughter) Yeah. And I think he looks now less miserable. And it was great. With this experience, I started to look more closely at modern art. Then I realized how, you know, the world of modern art is particularly topsy-turvy.And I can show here a very good example. It's actually a simple one, but it's a good one to start with. It's a picture by Paul Klee. And we can see here very clearly, it's a confusion of color. (Laughter) Yeah. The artist doesn't really seem to know where to put the different colors. The various pictures here of the various elements of the picture \u2014 the whole thing is unstructured. We don't know, maybe Mr. Klee was probably in a hurry, I mean \u2014 (Laughter) \u2014 maybe he had to catch a plane, or something. We can see here he started out with orange, and then he already ran out of orange, and here we can see he decided to take a break for a square. And I would like to show you here my tidied up version of this picture. (Laughter) We can see now what was barely recognizable in the original: 17 red and orange squares are juxtaposed with just two green squares. Yeah, that's great. So I mean, that's just tidying up for beginners. I would like to show you here a picture which is a bit more advanced. (Laughter)What can you say? What a mess. I mean, you see, everything seems to have been scattered aimlessly around the space. If my room back home had looked like this, my mother would have grounded me for three days. So I'd like to \u2014 I wanted to reintroduce some structure into that picture. And that's really advanced tidying up. (Applause) Yeah, you're right. Sometimes people clap at this point, but that's actually more in Switzerland. (Laughter) We Swiss are famous for chocolate and cheese. Our trains run on time. We are only happy when things are in order.But to go on, here is a very good example to see. This is a picture by Joan Miro. And yeah, we can see the artist has drawn a few lines and shapes and dropped them any old way onto a yellow background. And yeah, it's the sort of thing you produce when you're doodling on the phone. (Laughter) And this is my \u2014 (Laughter) \u2014 you can see now the whole thing takes up far less space. It's more economical and also more efficient. With this method Mr. Miro could have saved canvas for another picture.But I can see in your faces that you're still a little bit skeptical. So that you can just appreciate how serious I am about all this, I brought along the patents, the specifications for some of these works, because I've had my working methods patented at the Eidgen\u00f6ssische Amt f\u00fcr Geistiges Eigentum in Bern, Switzerland. (Laughter) I'll just quote from the specification. \"Laut den Kunstpr\u00fcfer Dr. Albrecht \u2014\" It's not finished yet. \"Laut den Kunstpr\u00fcfer Dr. Albrecht G\u00f6tz von Ohlenhusen wird die Verfahrensweise rechtlich gesch\u00fctzt welche die Kunst durch spezifisch aufger\u00e4umte Regelm\u00e4ssigkeiten des allgemeinen Formenschatzes neue Wirkungen zu erzielen m\u00f6glich wird.\"Ja, well I could have translated that, but you would have been none the wiser. I'm not sure myself what it means but it sounds good anyway. I just realized it's important how one introduces new ideas to people, that's why these patents are sometimes necessary. I would like to do a short test with you. Everyone is sitting in quite an orderly fashion here this morning. So I would like to ask you all to raise your right hand. Yeah. The right hand is the one we write with, apart from the left-handers. And now, I'll count to three. I mean, it still looks very orderly to me. Now, I'll count to three, and on the count of three I'd like you all to shake hands with the person behind you. OK? One, two, three. (Laughter)You can see now, that's a good example: even behaving in an orderly, systematic way can sometimes lead to complete chaos. So we can also see that very clearly in this next painting. This is a painting by the artist, Niki de Saint Phalle. And I mean, in the original it's completely unclear to see what this tangle of colors and shapes is supposed to depict. But in the tidied up version, it's plain to see that it's a sunburnt woman playing volleyball. (Laughter) Yeah, it's a \u2014 this one here, that's much better. That's a picture by Keith Haring. (Laughter) I think it doesn't matter. So, I mean, this picture has not even got a proper title. It's called \"Untitled\" and I think that's appropriate.So, in the tidied-up version we have a sort of Keith Haring spare parts shop. (Laughter) This is Keith Haring looked at statistically. One can see here quite clearly, you can see we have 25 pale green elements, of which one is in the form of a circle. Or here, for example, we have 27 pink squares with only one pink curve. I mean, that's interesting. One could extend this sort of statistical analysis to cover all Mr. Haring's various works, in order to establish in which period the artist favored pale green circles or pink squares. And the artist himself could also benefit from this sort of listing procedure by using it to estimate how many pots of paint he's likely to need in the future. (Laughter)One can obviously also make combinations. For example, with the Keith Haring circles and Kandinsky's dots. You can add them to all the squares of Paul Klee. In the end, one has a list with which one then can arrange. Then you categorize it, then you file it, put that file in a filing cabinet, put it in your office and you can make a living doing it. (Laughter) Yeah, from my own experience. So I'm \u2014 (Laughter) Actually, I mean, here we have some artists that are a bit more structured. It's not too bad. This is Jasper Johns. We can see here he was practicing with his ruler. (Laughter)But I think it could still benefit from more discipline. And I think the whole thing adds up much better if you do it like this. (Laughter) And here, that's one of my favorites. Tidying up Rene Magritte \u2014 this is really fun. You know, there is a \u2014 (Laughter) I'm always being asked what inspired me to embark on all this. It goes back to a time when I was very often staying in hotels. So once I had the opportunity to stay in a ritzy, five-star hotel. And you know, there you had this little sign \u2014 I put this little sign outside the door every morning that read, \"Please tidy room.\" I don't know if you have them over here. So actually, my room there hasn't been tidied once daily, but three times a day. So after a while I decided to have a little fun, and before leaving the room each day I'd scatter a few things around the space. Like books, clothes, toothbrush, etc. And it was great. By the time I returned everything had always been neatly returned to its place. But then one morning, I hang the same little sign onto that picture by Vincent van Gogh. (Laughter) And you have to say this room hadn't been tidied up since 1888. And when I returned it looked like this. (Laughter) Yeah, at least it is now possible to do some vacuuming. (Laughter)OK, I mean, I can see there are always people that like reacting that one or another picture hasn't been properly tidied up. So we can make a short test with you. This is a picture by Rene Magritte, and I'd like you all to inwardly \u2014 like in your head, that is \u2014 to tidy that up. So it's possible that some of you would make it like this. (Laughter) Yeah? I would actually prefer to do it more this way. Some people would make apple pie out of it. But it's a very good example to see that the whole work was more of a handicraft endeavor that involved the very time-consuming job of cutting out the various elements and sticking them back in new arrangements. And it's not done, as many people imagine, with the computer, otherwise it would look like this. (Laughter)So now I've been able to tidy up pictures that I've wanted to tidy up for a long time. Here is a very good example. Take Jackson Pollock, for example. It's \u2014 oh, no, it's \u2014 that's a really hard one. But after a while, I just decided here to go all the way and put the paint back into the cans. (Applause) Or you could go into three-dimensional art. Here we have the fur cup by Meret Oppenheim. Here I just brought it back to its original state. (Laughter) But yeah, and it's great, you can even go, you know \u2014 Or we have this pointillist movement for those of you who are into art. The pointillist movement is that kind of paintings where everything is broken down into dots and pixels. And then I \u2014 this sort of thing is ideal for tidying up. (Laughter)So I once applied myself to the work of the inventor of that method, Georges Seurat, and I collected together all his dots. And now they're all in here. (Laughter) You can count them afterwards, if you like. You see, that's the wonderful thing about the tidy up art idea: it's new. So there is no existing tradition in it. There is no textbooks, I mean, not yet, anyway. I mean, it's \"the future we will create.\" (Laughter) But to round things up I would like to show you just one more. This is the village square by Pieter Bruegel. That's how it looks like when you send everyone home. (Laughter) Yeah, maybe you're asking yourselves where old Bruegel's people went? Of course, they're not gone. They're all here. (Laughter) I just piled them up. (Laughter)So I'm \u2014 yeah, actually I'm kind of finished at that moment. And for those who want to see more, I've got my book downstairs in the bookshop. And I'm happy to sign it for you with any name of any artist. (Laughter) But before leaving I would like to show you, I'm working right now on another \u2014 in a related field with my tidying up art method. I'm working in a related field. And I started to bring some order into some flags. Here \u2014 that's just my new proposal here for the Union Jack. (Laughter) And then maybe before I leave you ... yeah, I think, after you have seen that I have to leave anyway. (Laughter) Yeah, that was a hard one. I couldn't find a way to tidy that up properly, so I just decided to make it a little bit more simpler. (Laughter) Thank you very much. (Applause)", "id": 400, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:11.958 --> 00:00:15.958\nMy name is Ursus Wehrli, and I would like to talk to you this morning\n\n00:00:15.958 --> 00:00:17.958\nabout my project, Tidying Up Art.\n\n00:00:17.958 --> 00:00:22.958\nFirst of all -- any questions so far?\n\n00:00:22.958 --> 00:00:25.958\nFirst of all, I have to say I'm not from around here.\n\n00:00:25.958 --> 00:00:29.958\nI'm from a completely different cultural area, maybe you noticed?\n\n00:00:29.958 --> 00:00:34.958\nI mean, I'm wearing a tie, first. And then secondly, I'm a little bit nervous\n\n00:00:34.958 --> 00:00:37.958\nbecause I'm speaking in a foreign language,\n\n00:00:37.958 --> 00:00:41.958\nand I want to apologize in advance, for any mistakes I might make.\n\n00:00:41.958 --> 00:00:46.958\nBecause I'm from Switzerland, and I just don't hope you think this is Swiss German\n\n00:00:46.958 --> 00:00:48.958\nI'm speaking now here. This is just what it sounds like\n\n00:00:48.958 --> 00:00:51.958\nif we Swiss try to speak American.\n\n00:00:51.958 --> 00:00:54.958\nBut don't worry -- I don't have trouble with English, as such.\n\n00:00:54.958 --> 00:00:58.958\nI mean, it's not my problem, it's your language after all.\n\n00:00:58.958 --> 00:01:00.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:01:00.958 --> 00:01:04.958\nI am fine. After this presentation here at TED, I can simply go back to Switzerland,\n\n00:01:04.958 --> 00:01:07.958\nand you have to go on talking like this all the time.\n\n00:01:07.958 --> 00:01:11.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:01:11.958 --> 00:01:14.958\nSo I've been asked by the organizers to read from my book.\n\n00:01:14.958 --> 00:01:17.958\nIt's called \"Tidying Up Art\" and it's, as you can see,\n\n00:01:17.958 --> 00:01:20.958\nit's more or less a picture book.\n\n00:01:20.958 --> 00:01:24.958\nSo the reading would be over very quickly.\n\n00:01:24.958 --> 00:01:30.958\nBut since I'm here at TED, I decided to hold my talk here in a more modern way,\n\n00:01:30.958 --> 00:01:34.958\nin the spirit of TED here, and I managed to do some slides here for you.\n\n00:01:34.958 --> 00:01:38.958\nI'd like to show them around so we can just, you know --\n\n00:01:38.958 --> 00:01:40.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:01:40.958 --> 00:01:43.958\nActually, I managed to prepare for you some enlarged pictures -- even better.\n\n00:01:43.958 --> 00:01:48.958\nSo Tidying Up Art, I mean, I have to say, that's a relatively new term.\n\n00:01:48.958 --> 00:01:50.958\nYou won't be familiar with it.\n\n00:01:50.958 --> 00:01:55.958\nI mean, it's a hobby of mine that I've been indulging in for the last few years,\n\n00:01:55.958 --> 00:02:00.958\nand it all started out with this picture of the American artist, Donald Baechler\n\n00:02:00.958 --> 00:02:03.958\nI had hanging at home. I had to look at it every day\n\n00:02:03.958 --> 00:02:07.958\nand after a while I just couldn't stand the mess anymore\n\n00:02:07.958 --> 00:02:10.958\nthis guy was looking at all day long.\n\n00:02:10.958 --> 00:02:13.958\nYeah, I kind of felt sorry for him.\n\n00:02:13.958 --> 00:02:15.958\nAnd it seemed to me even he felt really bad\n\n00:02:15.958 --> 00:02:19.958\nfacing these unorganized red squares day after day.\n\n00:02:19.958 --> 00:02:21.958\nSo I decided to give him a little support,\n\n00:02:21.958 --> 00:02:26.958\nand brought some order into neatly stacking the blocks on top of each other.\n\n00:02:26.958 --> 00:02:29.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:02:29.958 --> 00:02:33.958\nYeah. And I think he looks now less miserable.\n\n00:02:33.958 --> 00:02:39.958\nAnd it was great. With this experience, I started to look more closely\n\n00:02:39.958 --> 00:02:44.958\nat modern art. Then I realized how, you know, the world of modern art\n\n00:02:44.958 --> 00:02:46.958\nis particularly topsy-turvy.\n\n00:02:46.958 --> 00:02:49.958\nAnd I can show here a very good example.\n\n00:02:49.958 --> 00:02:52.958\nIt's actually a simple one, but it's a good one to start with.\n\n00:02:52.958 --> 00:02:55.958\nIt's a picture by Paul Klee.\n\n00:02:55.958 --> 00:02:59.958\nAnd we can see here very clearly, it's a confusion of color.\n\n00:02:59.958 --> 00:03:01.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:03:01.958 --> 00:03:07.958\nYeah. The artist doesn't really seem to know where to put the different colors.\n\n00:03:07.958 --> 00:03:10.958\nThe various pictures here of the various elements of the picture --\n\n00:03:10.958 --> 00:03:11.958\nthe whole thing is unstructured.\n\n00:03:11.958 --> 00:03:15.958\nWe don't know, maybe Mr. Klee was probably in a hurry, I mean --\n\n00:03:15.958 --> 00:03:17.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:03:17.958 --> 00:03:20.958\n-- maybe he had to catch a plane, or something.\n\n00:03:20.958 --> 00:03:23.958\nWe can see here he started out with orange,\n\n00:03:23.958 --> 00:03:26.958\nand then he already ran out of orange,\n\n00:03:26.958 --> 00:03:30.958\nand here we can see he decided to take a break for a square.\n\n00:03:30.958 --> 00:03:33.958\nAnd I would like to show you here my tidied up version of this picture.\n\n00:03:33.958 --> 00:03:38.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:03:38.958 --> 00:03:42.958\nWe can see now what was barely recognizable in the original:\n\n00:03:42.958 --> 00:03:49.958\n17 red and orange squares are juxtaposed with just two green squares.\n\n00:03:49.958 --> 00:03:50.958\nYeah, that's great.\n\n00:03:50.958 --> 00:03:56.958\nSo I mean, that's just tidying up for beginners.\n\n00:03:56.958 --> 00:03:59.958\nI would like to show you here a picture which is a bit more advanced.\n\n00:03:59.958 --> 00:04:04.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:04:04.958 --> 00:04:05.958\nWhat can you say? What a mess.\n\n00:04:05.958 --> 00:04:12.958\nI mean, you see, everything seems to have been scattered aimlessly around the space.\n\n00:04:12.958 --> 00:04:15.958\nIf my room back home had looked like this,\n\n00:04:15.958 --> 00:04:17.958\nmy mother would have grounded me for three days.\n\n00:04:17.958 --> 00:04:22.958\nSo I'd like to -- I wanted to reintroduce some structure into that picture.\n\n00:04:22.958 --> 00:04:27.958\nAnd that's really advanced tidying up.\n\n00:04:27.958 --> 00:04:30.958\n(Applause)\n\n00:04:30.958 --> 00:04:32.958\nYeah, you're right. Sometimes people clap at this point,\n\n00:04:32.958 --> 00:04:35.958\nbut that's actually more in Switzerland.\n\n00:04:35.958 --> 00:04:40.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:04:40.958 --> 00:04:44.958\nWe Swiss are famous for chocolate and cheese. Our trains run on time.\n\n00:04:44.958 --> 00:04:47.958\nWe are only happy when things are in order.\n\n00:04:47.958 --> 00:04:51.958\nBut to go on, here is a very good example to see.\n\n00:04:51.958 --> 00:04:54.958\nThis is a picture by Joan Miro.\n\n00:04:54.958 --> 00:04:59.958\nAnd yeah, we can see the artist has drawn a few lines and shapes\n\n00:04:59.958 --> 00:05:03.958\nand dropped them any old way onto a yellow background.\n\n00:05:03.958 --> 00:05:06.958\nAnd yeah, it's the sort of thing you produce when you're doodling on the phone.\n\n00:05:06.958 --> 00:05:09.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:05:09.958 --> 00:05:10.958\nAnd this is my --\n\n00:05:10.958 --> 00:05:13.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:05:13.958 --> 00:05:17.958\n-- you can see now the whole thing takes up far less space.\n\n00:05:17.958 --> 00:05:20.958\nIt's more economical and also more efficient.\n\n00:05:20.958 --> 00:05:24.958\nWith this method Mr. Miro could have saved canvas for another picture.\n\n00:05:24.958 --> 00:05:28.958\nBut I can see in your faces that you're still a little bit skeptical.\n\n00:05:28.958 --> 00:05:32.958\nSo that you can just appreciate how serious I am about all this,\n\n00:05:32.958 --> 00:05:37.958\nI brought along the patents, the specifications for some of these works,\n\n00:05:37.958 --> 00:05:39.958\nbecause I've had my working methods patented\n\n00:05:39.958 --> 00:05:43.958\nat the Eidgen\u00f6ssische Amt f\u00fcr Geistiges Eigentum in Bern, Switzerland.\n\n00:05:43.958 --> 00:05:46.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:05:46.958 --> 00:05:48.958\nI'll just quote from the specification.\n\n00:05:48.958 --> 00:05:52.958\n\"Laut den Kunstpr\u00fcfer Dr. Albrecht --\"\n\n00:05:52.958 --> 00:05:54.958\nIt's not finished yet.\n\n00:05:54.958 --> 00:05:58.958\n\"Laut den Kunstpr\u00fcfer Dr. Albrecht G\u00f6tz von Ohlenhusen\n\n00:05:58.958 --> 00:06:01.958\nwird die Verfahrensweise rechtlich gesch\u00fctzt welche die Kunst\n\n00:06:01.958 --> 00:06:03.958\ndurch spezifisch aufger\u00e4umte Regelm\u00e4ssigkeiten\n\n00:06:03.958 --> 00:06:05.958\ndes allgemeinen Formenschatzes\n\n00:06:05.958 --> 00:06:08.958\nneue Wirkungen zu erzielen m\u00f6glich wird.\"\n\n00:06:10.958 --> 00:06:14.958\nJa, well I could have translated that, but you would have been none the wiser.\n\n00:06:14.958 --> 00:06:18.958\nI'm not sure myself what it means but it sounds good anyway.\n\n00:06:18.958 --> 00:06:23.958\nI just realized it's important how one introduces new ideas to people,\n\n00:06:23.958 --> 00:06:25.958\nthat's why these patents are sometimes necessary.\n\n00:06:25.958 --> 00:06:27.958\nI would like to do a short test with you.\n\n00:06:27.958 --> 00:06:30.958\nEveryone is sitting in quite an orderly fashion here this morning.\n\n00:06:30.958 --> 00:06:35.958\nSo I would like to ask you all to raise your right hand. Yeah.\n\n00:06:35.958 --> 00:06:38.958\nThe right hand is the one we write with, apart from the left-handers.\n\n00:06:38.958 --> 00:06:43.958\nAnd now, I'll count to three. I mean, it still looks very orderly to me.\n\n00:06:43.958 --> 00:06:45.958\nNow, I'll count to three, and on the count of three\n\n00:06:45.958 --> 00:06:48.958\nI'd like you all to shake hands with the person behind you. OK?\n\n00:06:48.958 --> 00:06:50.958\nOne, two, three.\n\n00:06:50.958 --> 00:06:59.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:06:59.958 --> 00:07:03.958\nYou can see now, that's a good example: even behaving in an orderly, systematic way\n\n00:07:03.958 --> 00:07:06.958\ncan sometimes lead to complete chaos.\n\n00:07:06.958 --> 00:07:10.958\nSo we can also see that very clearly in this next painting.\n\n00:07:10.958 --> 00:07:15.958\nThis is a painting by the artist, Niki de Saint Phalle.\n\n00:07:15.958 --> 00:07:20.958\nAnd I mean, in the original it's completely unclear to see\n\n00:07:20.958 --> 00:07:25.958\nwhat this tangle of colors and shapes is supposed to depict.\n\n00:07:25.958 --> 00:07:30.958\nBut in the tidied up version, it's plain to see that it's a sunburnt woman playing volleyball.\n\n00:07:31.958 --> 00:07:34.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:07:34.958 --> 00:07:41.958\nYeah, it's a -- this one here, that's much better.\n\n00:07:41.958 --> 00:07:44.958\nThat's a picture by Keith Haring.\n\n00:07:44.958 --> 00:07:48.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:07:48.958 --> 00:07:50.958\nI think it doesn't matter.\n\n00:07:50.958 --> 00:07:54.958\nSo, I mean, this picture has not even got a proper title.\n\n00:07:54.958 --> 00:08:00.958\nIt's called \"Untitled\" and I think that's appropriate.\n\n00:08:00.958 --> 00:08:05.958\nSo, in the tidied-up version we have a sort of Keith Haring spare parts shop.\n\n00:08:05.958 --> 00:08:08.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:08:08.958 --> 00:08:11.958\nThis is Keith Haring looked at statistically.\n\n00:08:11.958 --> 00:08:13.958\nOne can see here quite clearly,\n\n00:08:13.958 --> 00:08:17.958\nyou can see we have 25 pale green elements,\n\n00:08:17.958 --> 00:08:19.958\nof which one is in the form of a circle.\n\n00:08:19.958 --> 00:08:24.958\nOr here, for example, we have 27 pink squares with only one pink curve.\n\n00:08:24.958 --> 00:08:28.958\nI mean, that's interesting. One could extend this sort of statistical analysis\n\n00:08:28.958 --> 00:08:30.958\nto cover all Mr. Haring's various works,\n\n00:08:30.958 --> 00:08:36.958\nin order to establish in which period the artist favored pale green circles or pink squares.\n\n00:08:36.958 --> 00:08:40.958\nAnd the artist himself could also benefit from this sort of listing procedure\n\n00:08:40.958 --> 00:08:45.958\nby using it to estimate how many pots of paint he's likely to need in the future.\n\n00:08:45.958 --> 00:08:46.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:08:46.958 --> 00:08:49.958\nOne can obviously also make combinations.\n\n00:08:49.958 --> 00:08:53.958\nFor example, with the Keith Haring circles and Kandinsky's dots.\n\n00:08:53.958 --> 00:08:55.958\nYou can add them to all the squares of Paul Klee.\n\n00:08:55.958 --> 00:08:58.958\nIn the end, one has a list with which one then can arrange.\n\n00:08:58.958 --> 00:09:02.958\nThen you categorize it, then you file it, put that file in a filing cabinet,\n\n00:09:02.958 --> 00:09:08.958\nput it in your office and you can make a living doing it.\n\n00:09:08.958 --> 00:09:10.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:09:10.958 --> 00:09:12.958\nYeah, from my own experience. So I'm --\n\n00:09:12.958 --> 00:09:15.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:09:15.958 --> 00:09:20.958\nActually, I mean, here we have some artists that are a bit more structured. It's not too bad.\n\n00:09:20.958 --> 00:09:25.958\nThis is Jasper Johns. We can see here he was practicing with his ruler.\n\n00:09:25.958 --> 00:09:27.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:09:27.958 --> 00:09:31.958\nBut I think it could still benefit from more discipline.\n\n00:09:31.958 --> 00:09:35.958\nAnd I think the whole thing adds up much better if you do it like this.\n\n00:09:35.958 --> 00:09:41.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:09:41.958 --> 00:09:44.958\nAnd here, that's one of my favorites.\n\n00:09:44.958 --> 00:09:47.958\nTidying up Rene Magritte -- this is really fun.\n\n00:09:47.958 --> 00:09:48.958\nYou know, there is a --\n\n00:09:48.958 --> 00:09:50.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:09:50.958 --> 00:09:54.958\nI'm always being asked what inspired me to embark on all this.\n\n00:09:54.958 --> 00:09:57.958\nIt goes back to a time when I was very often staying in hotels.\n\n00:09:57.958 --> 00:10:01.958\nSo once I had the opportunity to stay in a ritzy, five-star hotel.\n\n00:10:01.958 --> 00:10:03.958\nAnd you know, there you had this little sign --\n\n00:10:03.958 --> 00:10:09.958\nI put this little sign outside the door every morning that read,\n\n00:10:09.958 --> 00:10:12.958\n\"Please tidy room.\" I don't know if you have them over here.\n\n00:10:12.958 --> 00:10:18.958\nSo actually, my room there hasn't been tidied once daily, but three times a day.\n\n00:10:18.958 --> 00:10:21.958\nSo after a while I decided to have a little fun,\n\n00:10:21.958 --> 00:10:26.958\nand before leaving the room each day I'd scatter a few things around the space.\n\n00:10:26.958 --> 00:10:30.958\nLike books, clothes, toothbrush, etc. And it was great.\n\n00:10:30.958 --> 00:10:34.958\nBy the time I returned everything had always been neatly returned to its place.\n\n00:10:34.958 --> 00:10:42.958\nBut then one morning, I hang the same little sign onto that picture by Vincent van Gogh.\n\n00:10:42.958 --> 00:10:44.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:10:44.958 --> 00:10:50.958\nAnd you have to say this room hadn't been tidied up since 1888.\n\n00:10:50.958 --> 00:10:53.958\nAnd when I returned it looked like this.\n\n00:10:53.958 --> 00:11:00.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:11:00.958 --> 00:11:02.958\nYeah, at least it is now possible to do some vacuuming.\n\n00:11:02.958 --> 00:11:05.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:11:05.958 --> 00:11:07.958\nOK, I mean, I can see there are always people\n\n00:11:07.958 --> 00:11:11.958\nthat like reacting that one or another picture\n\n00:11:11.958 --> 00:11:16.958\nhasn't been properly tidied up. So we can make a short test with you.\n\n00:11:16.958 --> 00:11:18.958\nThis is a picture by Rene Magritte,\n\n00:11:18.958 --> 00:11:22.958\nand I'd like you all to inwardly -- like in your head, that is --\n\n00:11:22.958 --> 00:11:28.958\nto tidy that up. So it's possible that some of you would make it like this.\n\n00:11:28.958 --> 00:11:30.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:11:30.958 --> 00:11:35.958\nYeah? I would actually prefer to do it more this way.\n\n00:11:35.958 --> 00:11:39.958\nSome people would make apple pie out of it.\n\n00:11:39.958 --> 00:11:41.958\nBut it's a very good example to see that the whole work\n\n00:11:41.958 --> 00:11:46.958\nwas more of a handicraft endeavor that involved the very time-consuming job\n\n00:11:46.958 --> 00:11:52.958\nof cutting out the various elements and sticking them back in new arrangements.\n\n00:11:52.958 --> 00:11:55.958\nAnd it's not done, as many people imagine, with the computer,\n\n00:11:55.958 --> 00:11:59.958\notherwise it would look like this.\n\n00:11:59.958 --> 00:12:04.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:12:04.958 --> 00:12:10.958\nSo now I've been able to tidy up pictures that I've wanted to tidy up for a long time.\n\n00:12:10.958 --> 00:12:13.958\nHere is a very good example. Take Jackson Pollock, for example.\n\n00:12:13.958 --> 00:12:18.958\nIt's -- oh, no, it's -- that's a really hard one.\n\n00:12:18.958 --> 00:12:23.958\nBut after a while, I just decided here to go all the way\n\n00:12:23.958 --> 00:12:26.958\nand put the paint back into the cans.\n\n00:12:26.958 --> 00:12:36.958\n(Applause)\n\n00:12:36.958 --> 00:12:41.958\nOr you could go into three-dimensional art.\n\n00:12:41.958 --> 00:12:46.958\nHere we have the fur cup by Meret Oppenheim.\n\n00:12:46.958 --> 00:12:49.958\nHere I just brought it back to its original state.\n\n00:12:49.958 --> 00:12:57.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:12:57.958 --> 00:13:02.958\nBut yeah, and it's great, you can even go, you know --\n\n00:13:02.958 --> 00:13:08.958\nOr we have this pointillist movement for those of you who are into art.\n\n00:13:08.958 --> 00:13:10.958\nThe pointillist movement is that kind of paintings\n\n00:13:11.958 --> 00:13:14.958\nwhere everything is broken down into dots and pixels.\n\n00:13:14.958 --> 00:13:18.958\nAnd then I -- this sort of thing is ideal for tidying up.\n\n00:13:18.958 --> 00:13:21.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:13:21.958 --> 00:13:25.958\nSo I once applied myself to the work of the inventor of that method, Georges Seurat,\n\n00:13:25.958 --> 00:13:27.958\nand I collected together all his dots.\n\n00:13:27.958 --> 00:13:29.958\nAnd now they're all in here.\n\n00:13:29.958 --> 00:13:34.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:13:34.958 --> 00:13:35.958\nYou can count them afterwards, if you like.\n\n00:13:35.958 --> 00:13:40.958\nYou see, that's the wonderful thing about the tidy up art idea:\n\n00:13:40.958 --> 00:13:43.958\nit's new. So there is no existing tradition in it.\n\n00:13:43.958 --> 00:13:47.958\nThere is no textbooks, I mean, not yet, anyway.\n\n00:13:47.958 --> 00:13:51.958\nI mean, it's \"the future we will create.\"\n\n00:13:51.958 --> 00:13:53.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:13:53.958 --> 00:13:58.958\nBut to round things up I would like to show you just one more.\n\n00:13:58.958 --> 00:14:01.958\nThis is the village square by Pieter Bruegel.\n\n00:14:01.958 --> 00:14:04.958\nThat's how it looks like when you send everyone home.\n\n00:14:04.958 --> 00:14:15.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:14:15.958 --> 00:14:17.958\nYeah, maybe you're asking yourselves\n\n00:14:17.958 --> 00:14:21.958\nwhere old Bruegel's people went?\n\n00:14:21.958 --> 00:14:25.958\nOf course, they're not gone. They're all here.\n\n00:14:25.958 --> 00:14:26.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:14:26.958 --> 00:14:28.958\nI just piled them up.\n\n00:14:28.958 --> 00:14:32.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:14:32.958 --> 00:14:36.958\nSo I'm -- yeah, actually I'm kind of finished at that moment.\n\n00:14:36.958 --> 00:14:41.958\nAnd for those who want to see more, I've got my book downstairs in the bookshop.\n\n00:14:42.958 --> 00:14:45.958\nAnd I'm happy to sign it for you with any name of any artist.\n\n00:14:47.958 --> 00:14:49.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:14:49.958 --> 00:14:53.958\nBut before leaving I would like to show you,\n\n00:14:53.958 --> 00:14:58.958\nI'm working right now on another -- in a related field\n\n00:14:58.958 --> 00:15:01.958\nwith my tidying up art method. I'm working in a related field.\n\n00:15:01.958 --> 00:15:07.958\nAnd I started to bring some order into some flags.\n\n00:15:07.958 --> 00:15:14.958\nHere -- that's just my new proposal here for the Union Jack.\n\n00:15:14.958 --> 00:15:19.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:15:19.958 --> 00:15:24.958\nAnd then maybe before I leave you ...\n\n00:15:24.958 --> 00:15:28.958\nyeah, I think, after you have seen that I have to leave anyway.\n\n00:15:28.958 --> 00:15:31.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:15:31.958 --> 00:15:37.958\nYeah, that was a hard one. I couldn't find a way to tidy that up properly,\n\n00:15:37.958 --> 00:15:41.958\nso I just decided to make it a little bit more simpler.\n\n00:15:41.958 --> 00:15:43.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:15:43.958 --> 00:15:44.958\nThank you very much.\n\n00:15:44.958 --> 00:15:45.958\n(Applause)"}, {"title": "The Long Now", "duration": "1403", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/stewart_brand_on_the_long_now", "transcript": "Welcome to 10,000 feet. Let me explain why we are here and why some of you have a pine cone close to you. Once upon a time, I did a book called \"How Buildings Learn.\" Today's event you might call \"How Mountains Teach.\" A little background: For 10 years I've been trying to figure out how to hack civilization so that we can get long-term thinking to be automatic and common instead of difficult and rare \u2014 or in some cases, non-existent. It would be helpful if humanity got into the habit of thinking of the now not just as next week or next quarter, but you know, next 10,000 years and the last 10,000 years \u2014 basically civilization's story so far.So we have the Long Now Foundation in San Francisco. It's an incubator for about a dozen projects, all having to do with continuity over the long term. Our core project is a rather ambitious folly \u2014 I suppose, a mythic undertaking: to build a 10,000-year clock that can really keep good time for that long a period. And the design problems of a project like that are just absolutely delicious. Go to the clock. And what we have here is something many of you saw here three years ago. It's the first working prototype of the clock. It's about nine feet high. Designed by Danny Hillis and Alexander Rose. It's presently in London, and is ticking away very deliberately at the science museum there.So the design problem for today is going to be, how do you house an eventual monumental clock like this so it can really tick, save time beautifully for 100 centuries? Well, this was the first solution. Alexander Rose came up with this idea of a spiraloid tower with continuous sloping ramps. And it looked like a way to go, until you start thinking about, what does deep time do to a building? Well, this is what deep time does to a building. This is the Parthenon. It's only 2,450 years old, and look what happened to it. Here's a beautiful project. They really knew it'd last forever, because they'd build it out of absolutely huge stones. And now it's a pathetic ruin and no one even knows what it was used for. That's what happens to buildings. They're vulnerable. Even the most durable and intactable buildings, like the pyramids of Giza, are in bad shape when you look up close. They've been looted inside and out. And they're built to protect things but they don't protect things.So we got to thinking, if you can't put things safely in a building, where can you safely put them? We thought, OK, underground. How about underground with a view? Underground in a place that's really solid. So the obvious answer was, we need a mountain. You don't want just any mountain. You need absolutely the right mountain if you're going to have a clock for 10,000 years. So here's an image of the long view of the search problem. And we got to thinking for various reasons it ought to be a desert mountain, so we got looking in the dry areas of the Southwest. We looked at mesas in New Mexico. We were looking at dead volcanoes in Arizona.Then Roger Kennedy, who was the director of the National Parks Service, led us to Eastern Nevada, to America's newest and oldest national park, which is called Great Basin National Park. It's right on the eastern border of Nevada. It's the highest range in the state \u2014 over 13,000 feet. And you'll notice that on the left, on the left, on the west, it's very steep, and on the right it's gentle. This place is remote. It's over 200 miles from any major city. It's nowhere near any Interstate or railroad. And it's \u2014 the only thing that goes by is what's called America's loneliest highway, U.S. 50.Now, inside the yellow line here, on the right is \u2014 that's all national park. Inside the green line is national forest. And then over to the left is Bureau of Land Management land and some private land. Now, as it happened, that two-mile-long strip right in the middle, this vertical, was available because it was private land. And thanks to Jay Walker who was here and Mitch Kapor who was here, who started the process, Long Now was able to get that two-mile-long strip of land. And now let's look at the grand truth of what's there.We're in Pole Canyon, looking west up the western escarpment of Mount Washington, which is 11,600 feet on top. Those white cliffs are a dense Cambrian limestone. That's a 2,000-foot thick formation, and it might be a beautiful place to hide a clock. It would be a pilgrimage to get to it; it would be a serious hike to get up to where the clock is. So last June, the Long Now board, some staff and some donors and advisors, made a two-week expedition to the mountain to explore it and investigate, one, if it's the right mountain, and two, if it's the right mountain, how it might actually work for us.Now Danny Hillis sort of framed the problem. He has a theory of how the overall clock experience should work. It's what he calls the seven stages of a mythic adventure. It starts with the image. The image is a picture you have in your mind of the goal at the end of the journey. In this case it might well be an image of the clock. Then there's the point of embarkation, that is, the point of transition from ordinary life to being a pilgrim on a quest. Then \u2014 this is a nice image of it, there's the labyrinth. The labyrinth is a concept, it's like a twilight zone, it's a place where it's difficult, where you get disoriented, maybe you get scared \u2014 but you have to go through it if you're going to get to some kind of deep reintegration. Then there should always be in sight the draw \u2014 a kind of a beacon that draws you on through the labyrinth to finish the process of getting there.Now Brian Eno, who's been in the thick of the Long Now process, spent two years making a C.D. called \"January 7003,\" and it's \"Bell Studies for the Clock of the Long Now.\" Based on \u2014 parts of it are based on an algorithm that Danny Hillis developed, so that a peal of 10 bells makes a different peal every day for 10,000 years. The Hillis algorithm. 10 factorial gives you that number. And in fact, pretty soon we'll hear the sound. January 7003. There it is.OK, back to Danny's list. Number five of the seven is the payoff. This is it. The climax. The goal. The main thing that you're trying to get to. And then Danny says a really great journey will have a secret payoff. Something you didn't expect that caps what you did expect. Then there's the return. You've got to have a gradual return to the ordinary world, so you have time to assimilate what you've learned. And then, how about a memento? Number seven. At the end of it there's something physical, a kind of reward that you take away. It might be a piece of a core drill of the mountain. Something that's just yours. How do you study a mountain for the kinds of things we're talking about? This is not a normal building project. What do you look for? What are the elements that will most affect your ideas and decisions?Start with borders. If you look on the left side of the cliffs here, that's national park. That's sacrosanct \u2014 you can't do anything with that. To the right of it is national forest. There's possibilities. The borders are important. Other elements were mines, weather, approaches and elevation. And especially trees. Look at those things up on top there. It turns out that Mount Washington is covered with bristlecone pines. They're the world's oldest living thing. People think they're just the size of shrubs, but that's not actually true. There are trees on that mountain that are 5,000 years old and still living. The wood is so solid it's like stone, and it lasts for a long time. So when you do tree ring studies of trunks that are on the mountain, some of them go back 10,000 years. The stone itself is absolutely beautiful, sculpted by millennia of very tough winters up there. We had tree ring analysts from the University of Arizona join us on the expedition.Now, if you guys have a pine cone handy, now's a good time to put it in your hand and feel it, especially on the end. That's interesting. You'll find out why it's called a bristlecone pine. A little sensory experience. Here's Danny Hillis in the midst of a bristlecone pine forest on Long Now land. I should say that the age of bristlecones was discovered, led by a theory. Edmund Schulman in the 1950s had been studying trees under great stress at Timberline, and came to the realization that he put in an article in Science magazine called, \"Longevity under Adversity in Conifers.\" And then, based on that principle, he started looking around at the various trees at Timberline, and realized that the bristlecone pines \u2014 he found some in the White Mountains that were over 4,000 years old. Longevity under adversity is a pretty interesting design principle in its own right.OK, onto the mines. The first asking price for the property when we looked at it in 1998 was one billion dollars for 180 acres and a couple of mines. Because the owner said, \"There's one billion dollars of beryllium in that mountain.\" And we said, \"Wow, that's great. Listen, we'll counter. How about zero?(Laughter)And we're a non-profit foundation, you can give us the property and take a hell of a tax deduction.(Laughter)All you have to do is prove to the government it's worth a billion dollars.\"Well, a few years went by and there was some kind of back and forth, and by and by, thanks to Mitch and Jay, we were able to buy the whole property for 140,000 dollars. This is one of the mines. It doesn't have any beryllium in it. It's called the Pole Adit. And it does have tungsten, a little bit of tungsten, left over, that's the kind of mine it was. But it goes a mile-and-a-half in a straight line, due east into the range, into very interesting territory \u2014 except that, as you'll see when we go inside in a minute, we were hoping for limestone but in there is just shale. And shale is not quite completely competent rock. Competent rock is rock that will hold itself up without any shoring. The shale would like some shoring, and so parts of it are caved in in there.That's Ben Roberts from \u2014 he's the bat specialist from the National Park. But there are many wonders back in there, like this weird fungus on some of the collapsed timbers. OK, here's another mine that's up on top of the property, and it dates back to 1870. That's what the property was originally built around \u2014 it was a set of mining claims. It was a very productive silver mine. In fact, it was the highest-operating mine in Nevada, and it ran year round. You can imagine what it was like in the winter at 10,000 feet. You may recognize a couple of the miners there. There's Jeff Bezos on the right and Paul Saville on the left looking for galena, which is the lead-silver thing. They didn't find any. They both kept their day jobs. Here's the last mine.It's called the Bonanza Adit. It's down in a canyon. And Alexander Rose on the left there worked with a bunch of people from the National Park to survey the whole mine. It's a mile deep. And they also found four species of bats in there. Now, almost all those mines, by the way, meet underneath the mountain. They don't quite, but it's something to think about. They don't quite meet. Let's go to weather. Mountains specialize in interesting weather. Way more interesting than Monterey even today.And so one Tuesday morning last June, there we were. Woke up in the morning \u2014 the mountain was covered with snow. That was a great time to go up and visit our weather station which again, thanks to Mitch Kapor, we're building up there. And it's a pretty interesting scene. This is, on the left there, the joyful lady is Pat Irwin, who's the regional head of the National Forest Service, and they gave us the temporary use permit to be there. We want a temporary use permit for the clock, eventually \u2014 10,000-year temporary use permit.(Laughter)The weather station's pretty interesting. Kurt Bollacker and Alexander Rose designed a radically wireless station. It runs on solar, and it sends a signal with that antenna and bounces it off of micrometeorite trails in the atmosphere to a place in Bozeman, Montana, where the data is taken down and then sent through landlines to San Francisco, where we put the data in real time up on our website. And there you see a week of weather at 9,400 feet on Mount Washington. Let's go to approaches. As it happens, there are no trails anywhere on Mount Washington, just a few old mining roads like this, so you have to bushwhack everywhere. But there's no bears, and there's no poison oak, and there's basically no people because this place has been empty for a long time. You can hike for days and not encounter anybody.Well, here's a potential approach. You need to come up the Lincoln Canyon. It's this beautiful world all of its own, surrounded by cliffs, and it's an easy hike to stroll up the canyon bottom, until you get to this barrier, and it actually presents a problem. So you can scratch Lincoln Canyon as an approach. Another possible approach is right up the western front of the mountain. You can see why we sometimes call it Long Mountain. And from where you're standing at 6,000 feet in the valley, it's an easy hike up to the mature pinyon and juniper forest through that knoll at the front at 7,600 feet. And you can carry right on up through meadows and steepening forest to the high base of the cliffs at 10,500 feet, where there's a bit of a problem.Now, Jeff Bezos advised us when he left at the end of the expedition, \"Make the clock inaccessible. The harder it is to get to, the more people will value it.\" And check \u2014 those are 600-foot vertical walls there. So Alexander Rose wanted to explore this route, and he started over here on the left from his pickup truck at 8,900 feet and headed up the mountain. Now, as you gain elevation your IQ goes down \u2014(Laughter)but your emotional affect goes up, which is great for having a mythic experience, whether you want to or not. In fact, Danny Hillis can estimate altitude by how much math he can't do in his head.(Laughter)Now, I happened to be on the radio with Alexander when he got to this point at the base of the cliffs, and he said, quote, \"There's a hidden notch. I think I can get up a ways.\" Now, he's a rock climber, but you know, he's our executive director. I don't want him killed. I know he's going to love cliffs. I'm saying, \"Be careful, be careful, be careful.\" Then he starts going up, and the next thing I hear is, \"I'm half-way up. It's like climbing stairs. I'm going up 60 degrees. It's a secret passage. It's like something from Tolkien.\" And I'm going, \"Careful, careful. Please be careful.\" And then, of course, the next thing I hear is, \"I've made it to the top. You can see all of creation from up here.\" And he dashed across the top of the mountains.In fact, there he is. That's Alexander Rose. First ascent of the western face to Mount Washington, and a solo ascent at that. This discovery changed everything about our sense of these cliffs and what to do with them. We realized that we had to name this thing that Alexander discovered. How about Zander's Crevice? No.(Laughter)So we finally decided on Alexander's Siq. Zander's Siq is named after \u2014 some of you have been to Petra, there's this wonderful slot canyon that leads into Petra called the Siq, and so this is the Siq. And it really is hidden. I can't find it in this image, and I'm not sure you can. Only when you get fresh snow can you see just along the rim there, and that brings it out.Now, Danny and I were up at this same area one day, and Danny looked over to the right and noticed something halfway up the cliffs, which is a kind of a porch or a cliff shelf with bristlecones on it, and supposed that people going up to the clock inside the mountain could come out onto that shelf and look down at the view. And the people toiling up the mountain could see them, these tiny little people up there, incredibly halfway up the cliff. How did they get there? Do I have to do that? And so that maybe becomes part of the draw and part of the labyrinth. You can get another angle on Danny's porch by going around to the south and looking north at the whole formation there. And you need to know that Danny's clock is to be kept accurate by a ray of sunshine, that perfect noon hitting it every sunny day, and the pulse of heat from that sets off a solar trigger which resets the clock to make it perfectly accurate. So even with the slowing of the rotation of the earth and so on, the clock will keep perfectly good time.So here we're looking from the south, look north. This is all Forest Service land. If you go up on top of those cliffs, that's some of the Long Now land in those trees. And if you go up there and look back, then you'll get a sense of what the view starts to be like from the top of the mountain. That's the long view. That's 80 miles to the horizon. And that's also timberline and those bristlecones really are shrubs. That's a different place to be. It's 11,400 feet and it's exquisite. Now, if you go over to the right from this image to looking at the edge of the cliffs, it's 600 foot, just about a yard to the left of Kurt Bollacker's foot, there is a 600-foot drop. He's ambling on over to Zander's Siq. That's what it looks like looking down it. We should probably put in a rail or something. Over on the eastern side it's gentle, as you can see. And that's not snow \u2014 that's what the white limestone looks like. You also see there a bighorn sheep. Their herd was reintroduced from Wyoming. And they're doing pretty well, but they've got a bit of trouble.This is Danny Hillis, and he's figuring out a design problem. he's trying to determine if where he is on a bit of Long Now land would appear from down in the valley to be the actual peak of the mountain. because the real peak is hidden around the corner. This is what in the infantry we used to call the military crest. And as it turned out the answer is, yes, that is from down below in the valley it does look like the peak, and that might be conjured with. We gradually realized we have three serious design domains to work on with this. One is the experience of the mountain. Another is the experience in the mountain. And the third is the experience from the mountain, which is really dominated by the view shed of the spring valley there behind Danny, and if you look off to the right, out there, 15 miles across to the Schell Creek range.In the front, there are 10 ranches strung right along the base of the mountains using the water from the mountains. In fact, there are artesian wells where water springs right into the air. One of the ranches is called the Kirkeby Ranch, and I'll take you there for a minute. It's a very nice ranch. Alfalfa and cattle, run by Paul and Ronnie Brenham, and it's pretty idyllic. It's also hard work. And most of these ranches are having trouble keeping going. This is their view to the west of the Schell Creek range. And if you go out to that line of trees at the far end, you'll see what the valley used to look like. This is Rocky Mountain junipers that have been there for thousands of years.And a scheme emerged that Long Now is looking to see if it might be possible to buy up the whole valley, because those 10 ranches with their 17,000 acres dominate a 500 square mile valley with their grazing allotments and so on, and there's a possibility that you could get the whole thing for five million dollars and gradually restore it to its wild condition, and somewhere in the process turn it back over to the National Park, and it would double the size of Great Basin National Park. That would be swell.OK, let's take one more look at the mountain itself. The clock experience should be profound, but from the outside it should be invisible. Now, at the base of the high cliffs there's this natural cave. It's only about 12 feet deep, but what if it were deepened from inside? You excavated from somewhere, came up from inside and deepened it. And then you could have an entrance which was very rough and narrow as you first went in, that gradually becomes more refined and then actually quite exquisite. And this stone takes a perfect polish. You'd have a polished set of passages and chambers in there eventually leading to the 10,000 year clock.And it's not a mine. This would be a nuanced evocation of the basic structure of the mountain, and you would be appreciating it as much from inside as you do from outside. This is architecture not made by building, but by what you very carefully take away. So that's what the mountain taught us. Most of the amazingness of the clock we can borrow from the amazingness of the mountain. All we have to do is highlight its spectacular features and blend in with them. It's not a clock in a mountain \u2014 it's a mountain clock. Now, the Tewa Indians in the Southwest have a saying for what you need to do when you want to think long term about anything. They say, \"pin peya obe\" \u2014 welcome to the mountain.Thank you.(Applause)", "id": 402, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:11.958 --> 00:00:14.958\nWelcome to 10,000 feet.\n\n00:00:14.958 --> 00:00:15.958\nLet me explain why we are here\n\n00:00:15.958 --> 00:00:19.958\nand why some of you have a pine cone close to you.\n\n00:00:19.958 --> 00:00:22.958\nOnce upon a time, I did a book called \"How Buildings Learn.\"\n\n00:00:22.958 --> 00:00:26.958\nToday's event you might call \"How Mountains Teach.\"\n\n00:00:26.958 --> 00:00:28.958\nA little background: For 10 years I've been trying to figure out how to\n\n00:00:28.958 --> 00:00:33.958\nhack civilization so that we can get long-term thinking\n\n00:00:33.958 --> 00:00:37.958\nto be automatic and common instead of difficult and rare --\n\n00:00:37.958 --> 00:00:40.958\nor in some cases, non-existent.\n\n00:00:40.958 --> 00:00:45.958\nIt would be helpful if humanity got into the habit of thinking\n\n00:00:45.958 --> 00:00:49.958\nof the now not just as next week or next quarter, but you know,\n\n00:00:49.958 --> 00:00:53.958\nnext 10,000 years and the last 10,000 years --\n\n00:00:53.958 --> 00:00:57.958\nbasically civilization's story so far.\n\n00:00:57.958 --> 00:00:59.958\nSo we have the Long Now Foundation in San Francisco.\n\n00:00:59.958 --> 00:01:01.958\nIt's an incubator for about a dozen projects,\n\n00:01:01.958 --> 00:01:05.958\nall having to do with continuity over the long term.\n\n00:01:05.958 --> 00:01:10.958\nOur core project is a rather ambitious folly --\n\n00:01:10.958 --> 00:01:15.958\nI suppose, a mythic undertaking: to build a 10,000-year clock\n\n00:01:15.958 --> 00:01:20.958\nthat can really keep good time for that long a period.\n\n00:01:20.958 --> 00:01:27.958\nAnd the design problems of a project like that are just absolutely delicious.\n\n00:01:27.958 --> 00:01:32.958\nGo to the clock. And what we have here is something\n\n00:01:32.958 --> 00:01:34.958\nmany of you saw here three years ago.\n\n00:01:34.958 --> 00:01:36.958\nIt's the first working prototype of the clock.\n\n00:01:36.958 --> 00:01:37.958\nIt's about nine feet high.\n\n00:01:37.958 --> 00:01:42.958\nDesigned by Danny Hillis and Alexander Rose. It's presently in London,\n\n00:01:42.958 --> 00:01:46.958\nand is ticking away very deliberately at the science museum there.\n\n00:01:46.958 --> 00:01:50.958\nSo the design problem for today is going to be,\n\n00:01:50.958 --> 00:01:54.958\nhow do you house an eventual monumental clock like this\n\n00:01:54.958 --> 00:01:59.958\nso it can really tick, save time beautifully for 100 centuries?\n\n00:01:59.958 --> 00:02:01.958\nWell, this was the first solution.\n\n00:02:01.958 --> 00:02:03.958\nAlexander Rose came up with this idea\n\n00:02:03.958 --> 00:02:08.958\nof a spiraloid tower with continuous sloping ramps.\n\n00:02:08.958 --> 00:02:10.958\nAnd it looked like a way to go, until you start thinking\n\n00:02:10.958 --> 00:02:13.958\nabout, what does deep time do to a building?\n\n00:02:13.958 --> 00:02:16.958\nWell, this is what deep time does to a building.\n\n00:02:16.958 --> 00:02:20.958\nThis is the Parthenon. It's only 2,450 years old,\n\n00:02:20.958 --> 00:02:21.958\nand look what happened to it.\n\n00:02:21.958 --> 00:02:24.958\nHere's a beautiful project. They really knew it'd last forever,\n\n00:02:24.958 --> 00:02:28.958\nbecause they'd build it out of absolutely huge stones.\n\n00:02:28.958 --> 00:02:31.958\nAnd now it's a pathetic ruin and no one even knows what it was used for.\n\n00:02:31.958 --> 00:02:34.958\nThat's what happens to buildings. They're vulnerable.\n\n00:02:34.958 --> 00:02:37.958\nEven the most durable and intactable buildings,\n\n00:02:37.958 --> 00:02:41.958\nlike the pyramids of Giza, are in bad shape when you look up close.\n\n00:02:41.958 --> 00:02:44.958\nThey've been looted inside and out.\n\n00:02:44.958 --> 00:02:47.958\nAnd they're built to protect things but they don't protect things.\n\n00:02:47.958 --> 00:02:51.958\nSo we got to thinking, if you can't put things safely in a building,\n\n00:02:51.958 --> 00:02:54.958\nwhere can you safely put them? We thought, OK, underground.\n\n00:02:54.958 --> 00:02:57.958\nHow about underground with a view?\n\n00:02:57.958 --> 00:02:59.958\nUnderground in a place that's really solid.\n\n00:02:59.958 --> 00:03:03.958\nSo the obvious answer was, we need a mountain.\n\n00:03:03.958 --> 00:03:05.958\nYou don't want just any mountain.\n\n00:03:05.958 --> 00:03:08.958\nYou need absolutely the right mountain\n\n00:03:08.958 --> 00:03:10.958\nif you're going to have a clock for 10,000 years.\n\n00:03:10.958 --> 00:03:15.958\nSo here's an image of the long view of the search problem.\n\n00:03:15.958 --> 00:03:19.958\nAnd we got to thinking for various reasons it ought to be a desert mountain,\n\n00:03:19.958 --> 00:03:22.958\nso we got looking in the dry areas of the Southwest.\n\n00:03:22.958 --> 00:03:25.958\nWe looked at mesas in New Mexico.\n\n00:03:25.958 --> 00:03:27.958\nWe were looking at dead volcanoes in Arizona.\n\n00:03:27.958 --> 00:03:30.958\nThen Roger Kennedy, who was the director of the National Parks Service,\n\n00:03:30.958 --> 00:03:32.958\nled us to Eastern Nevada,\n\n00:03:32.958 --> 00:03:35.958\nto America's newest and oldest national park,\n\n00:03:35.958 --> 00:03:39.958\nwhich is called Great Basin National Park.\n\n00:03:39.958 --> 00:03:42.958\nIt's right on the eastern border of Nevada.\n\n00:03:42.958 --> 00:03:46.958\nIt's the highest range in the state -- over 13,000 feet.\n\n00:03:46.958 --> 00:03:50.958\nAnd you'll notice that on the left, on the left, on the west, it's very steep,\n\n00:03:50.958 --> 00:03:53.958\nand on the right it's gentle.\n\n00:03:53.958 --> 00:03:57.958\nThis place is remote. It's over 200 miles from any major city.\n\n00:03:57.958 --> 00:04:00.958\nIt's nowhere near any Interstate or railroad.\n\n00:04:00.958 --> 00:04:04.958\nAnd it's -- the only thing that goes by is what's called\n\n00:04:04.958 --> 00:04:08.958\nAmerica's loneliest highway, U.S. 50.\n\n00:04:08.958 --> 00:04:13.958\nNow, inside the yellow line here, on the right is -- that's all national park.\n\n00:04:13.958 --> 00:04:16.958\nInside the green line is national forest.\n\n00:04:16.958 --> 00:04:20.958\nAnd then over to the left is Bureau of Land Management land and some private land.\n\n00:04:20.958 --> 00:04:23.958\nNow, as it happened, that two-mile-long strip right in the middle,\n\n00:04:23.958 --> 00:04:29.958\nthis vertical, was available because it was private land.\n\n00:04:29.958 --> 00:04:33.958\nAnd thanks to Jay Walker who was here and Mitch Kapor who was here,\n\n00:04:33.958 --> 00:04:39.958\nwho started the process, Long Now was able to get that two-mile-long strip of land.\n\n00:04:39.958 --> 00:04:42.958\nAnd now let's look at the grand truth of what's there.\n\n00:04:42.958 --> 00:04:46.958\nWe're in Pole Canyon, looking west up the western escarpment\n\n00:04:46.958 --> 00:04:51.958\nof Mount Washington, which is 11,600 feet on top.\n\n00:04:51.958 --> 00:04:54.958\nThose white cliffs are a dense Cambrian limestone.\n\n00:04:54.958 --> 00:04:57.958\nThat's a 2,000-foot thick formation,\n\n00:04:57.958 --> 00:05:02.958\nand it might be a beautiful place to hide a clock.\n\n00:05:02.958 --> 00:05:05.958\nIt would be a pilgrimage to get to it; it would be a serious hike\n\n00:05:05.958 --> 00:05:08.958\nto get up to where the clock is.\n\n00:05:08.958 --> 00:05:13.958\nSo last June, the Long Now board, some staff and some donors\n\n00:05:13.958 --> 00:05:18.958\nand advisors, made a two-week expedition to the mountain\n\n00:05:18.958 --> 00:05:23.958\nto explore it and investigate, one, if it's the right mountain,\n\n00:05:23.958 --> 00:05:27.958\nand two, if it's the right mountain, how it might actually work for us.\n\n00:05:27.958 --> 00:05:30.958\nNow Danny Hillis sort of framed the problem.\n\n00:05:30.958 --> 00:05:33.958\nHe has a theory of how the overall clock experience should work.\n\n00:05:33.958 --> 00:05:37.958\nIt's what he calls the seven stages of a mythic adventure.\n\n00:05:37.958 --> 00:05:41.958\nIt starts with the image. The image is a picture you have in your mind\n\n00:05:41.958 --> 00:05:43.958\nof the goal at the end of the journey.\n\n00:05:43.958 --> 00:05:46.958\nIn this case it might well be an image of the clock.\n\n00:05:46.958 --> 00:05:50.958\nThen there's the point of embarkation, that is, the point of transition\n\n00:05:50.958 --> 00:05:54.958\nfrom ordinary life to being a pilgrim on a quest.\n\n00:05:54.958 --> 00:05:58.958\nThen -- this is a nice image of it, there's the labyrinth.\n\n00:05:58.958 --> 00:06:02.958\nThe labyrinth is a concept, it's like a twilight zone,\n\n00:06:02.958 --> 00:06:05.958\nit's a place where it's difficult, where you get disoriented,\n\n00:06:05.958 --> 00:06:08.958\nmaybe you get scared -- but you have to go through it\n\n00:06:08.958 --> 00:06:11.958\nif you're going to get to some kind of deep reintegration.\n\n00:06:11.958 --> 00:06:15.958\nThen there should always be in sight the draw --\n\n00:06:15.958 --> 00:06:18.958\na kind of a beacon that draws you on through the labyrinth\n\n00:06:18.958 --> 00:06:21.958\nto finish the process of getting there.\n\n00:06:21.958 --> 00:06:24.958\nNow Brian Eno, who's been in the thick of the Long Now process,\n\n00:06:24.958 --> 00:06:29.958\nspent two years making a C.D. called \"January 7003,\"\n\n00:06:29.958 --> 00:06:32.958\nand it's \"Bell Studies for the Clock of the Long Now.\"\n\n00:06:32.958 --> 00:06:37.958\nBased on -- parts of it are based on an algorithm that Danny Hillis developed,\n\n00:06:37.958 --> 00:06:39.958\nso that a peal of 10 bells\n\n00:06:39.958 --> 00:06:43.958\nmakes a different peal every day for 10,000 years.\n\n00:06:43.958 --> 00:06:47.958\nThe Hillis algorithm. 10 factorial gives you that number.\n\n00:06:47.958 --> 00:06:50.958\nAnd in fact, pretty soon we'll hear the sound.\n\n00:06:50.958 --> 00:06:54.958\nJanuary 7003. There it is.\n\n00:06:54.958 --> 00:06:56.958\nOK, back to Danny's list.\n\n00:06:56.958 --> 00:07:00.958\nNumber five of the seven is the payoff. This is it. The climax.\n\n00:07:00.958 --> 00:07:04.958\nThe goal. The main thing that you're trying to get to.\n\n00:07:04.958 --> 00:07:08.958\nAnd then Danny says a really great journey will have a secret payoff.\n\n00:07:08.958 --> 00:07:12.958\nSomething you didn't expect that caps what you did expect.\n\n00:07:12.958 --> 00:07:14.958\nThen there's the return.\n\n00:07:14.958 --> 00:07:17.958\nYou've got to have a gradual return to the ordinary world,\n\n00:07:17.958 --> 00:07:21.958\nso you have time to assimilate what you've learned. \n\n\n00:07:21.958 --> 00:07:25.958\nAnd then, how about a memento? Number seven.\n\n00:07:25.958 --> 00:07:26.958\nAt the end of it there's something physical,\n\n00:07:26.958 --> 00:07:28.958\na kind of reward that you take away.\n\n00:07:28.958 --> 00:07:30.958\nIt might be a piece of a core drill of the mountain.\n\n00:07:30.958 --> 00:07:33.958\nSomething that's just yours.\n\n00:07:33.958 --> 00:07:36.958\nHow do you study a mountain\n\n00:07:36.958 --> 00:07:38.958\nfor the kinds of things we're talking about?\n\n00:07:38.958 --> 00:07:40.958\nThis is not a normal building project.\n\n00:07:40.958 --> 00:07:41.958\nWhat do you look for?\n\n00:07:41.958 --> 00:07:47.958\nWhat are the elements that will most affect your ideas and decisions?\n\n00:07:47.958 --> 00:07:50.958\nStart with borders. If you look on the left side of the cliffs here,\n\n00:07:50.958 --> 00:07:52.958\nthat's national park. That's sacrosanct --\n\n00:07:52.958 --> 00:07:55.958\nyou can't do anything with that. To the right of it is national forest.\n\n00:07:55.958 --> 00:07:58.958\nThere's possibilities. The borders are important.\n\n00:07:58.958 --> 00:08:06.958\nOther elements were mines, weather, approaches and elevation.\n\n00:08:06.958 --> 00:08:09.958\nAnd especially trees. Look at those things up on top there.\n\n00:08:09.958 --> 00:08:13.958\nIt turns out that Mount Washington is covered with bristlecone pines.\n\n00:08:13.958 --> 00:08:16.958\nThey're the world's oldest living thing.\n\n00:08:16.958 --> 00:08:21.958\nPeople think they're just the size of shrubs, but that's not actually true.\n\n00:08:21.958 --> 00:08:28.958\nThere are trees on that mountain that are 5,000 years old and still living.\n\n00:08:28.958 --> 00:08:33.958\nThe wood is so solid it's like stone, and it lasts for a long time.\n\n00:08:33.958 --> 00:08:37.958\nSo when you do tree ring studies of trunks that are on the mountain,\n\n00:08:37.958 --> 00:08:40.958\nsome of them go back 10,000 years.\n\n00:08:40.958 --> 00:08:42.958\nThe stone itself is absolutely beautiful,\n\n00:08:42.958 --> 00:08:46.958\nsculpted by millennia of very tough winters up there.\n\n00:08:46.958 --> 00:08:49.958\nWe had tree ring analysts from the University of Arizona\n\n00:08:49.958 --> 00:08:51.958\njoin us on the expedition.\n\n00:08:51.958 --> 00:08:53.958\nNow, if you guys have a pine cone handy,\n\n00:08:53.958 --> 00:08:58.958\nnow's a good time to put it in your hand and feel it, especially on the end.\n\n00:08:58.958 --> 00:09:00.958\nThat's interesting.\n\n00:09:00.958 --> 00:09:06.958\nYou'll find out why it's called a bristlecone pine. A little sensory experience. \n\n\n00:09:06.958 --> 00:09:11.958\nHere's Danny Hillis in the midst of a bristlecone pine forest\n\n00:09:11.958 --> 00:09:16.958\non Long Now land. I should say that the age of bristlecones\n\n00:09:16.958 --> 00:09:19.958\nwas discovered, led by a theory.\n\n00:09:19.958 --> 00:09:21.958\nEdmund Schulman in the 1950s\n\n00:09:21.958 --> 00:09:25.958\nhad been studying trees under great stress at Timberline,\n\n00:09:25.958 --> 00:09:28.958\nand came to the realization that he put in an article in Science magazine\n\n00:09:28.958 --> 00:09:34.958\ncalled, \"Longevity under Adversity in Conifers.\"\n\n00:09:34.958 --> 00:09:37.958\nAnd then, based on that principle, he started looking around\n\n00:09:37.958 --> 00:09:39.958\nat the various trees at Timberline,\n\n00:09:39.958 --> 00:09:41.958\nand realized that the bristlecone pines --\n\n00:09:41.958 --> 00:09:46.958\nhe found some in the White Mountains that were over 4,000 years old.\n\n00:09:46.958 --> 00:09:51.958\nLongevity under adversity is a pretty interesting design principle in its own right. \n\n\n00:09:51.958 --> 00:09:55.958\nOK, onto the mines. The first asking price for the property\n\n00:09:55.958 --> 00:10:05.958\nwhen we looked at it in 1998 was one billion dollars for 180 acres and a couple of mines.\n\n00:10:05.958 --> 00:10:09.958\nBecause the owner said, \"There's one billion dollars of beryllium in that mountain.\"\n\n00:10:09.958 --> 00:10:14.958\nAnd we said, \"Wow, that's great. Listen, we'll counter. How about zero?\n\n00:10:14.958 --> 00:10:16.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:10:16.958 --> 00:10:20.958\nAnd we're a non-profit foundation, you can give us the property\n\n00:10:20.958 --> 00:10:23.958\nand take a hell of a tax deduction.\n\n00:10:23.958 --> 00:10:26.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:10:26.958 --> 00:10:29.958\nAll you have to do is prove to the government it's worth a billion dollars.\"\n\n00:10:29.958 --> 00:10:31.958\nWell, a few years went by and there was some kind of back and forth,\n\n00:10:31.958 --> 00:10:33.958\nand by and by, thanks to Mitch and Jay,\n\n00:10:33.958 --> 00:10:38.958\nwe were able to buy the whole property for 140,000 dollars.\n\n00:10:38.958 --> 00:10:42.958\nThis is one of the mines. It doesn't have any beryllium in it.\n\n00:10:42.958 --> 00:10:46.958\nIt's called the Pole Adit. And it does have tungsten,\n\n00:10:46.958 --> 00:10:49.958\na little bit of tungsten, left over, that's the kind of mine it was.\n\n00:10:49.958 --> 00:10:51.958\nBut it goes a mile-and-a-half in a straight line,\n\n00:10:51.958 --> 00:10:57.958\ndue east into the range, into very interesting territory -- except that,\n\n00:10:57.958 --> 00:11:00.958\nas you'll see when we go inside in a minute,\n\n00:11:00.958 --> 00:11:04.958\nwe were hoping for limestone but in there is just shale.\n\n00:11:04.958 --> 00:11:07.958\nAnd shale is not quite completely competent rock.\n\n00:11:07.958 --> 00:11:11.958\nCompetent rock is rock that will hold itself up without any shoring.\n\n00:11:11.958 --> 00:11:13.958\nThe shale would like some shoring,\n\n00:11:13.958 --> 00:11:15.958\nand so parts of it are caved in in there.\n\n00:11:15.958 --> 00:11:19.958\nThat's Ben Roberts from -- he's the bat specialist from the National Park.\n\n00:11:19.958 --> 00:11:23.958\nBut there are many wonders back in there, like this weird fungus\n\n00:11:23.958 --> 00:11:25.958\non some of the collapsed timbers.\n\n00:11:25.958 --> 00:11:29.958\nOK, here's another mine that's up on top of the property,\n\n00:11:29.958 --> 00:11:31.958\nand it dates back to 1870.\n\n00:11:31.958 --> 00:11:33.958\nThat's what the property was originally built around --\n\n00:11:33.958 --> 00:11:38.958\nit was a set of mining claims. It was a very productive silver mine.\n\n00:11:38.958 --> 00:11:41.958\nIn fact, it was the highest-operating mine in Nevada,\n\n00:11:41.958 --> 00:11:43.958\nand it ran year round.\n\n00:11:43.958 --> 00:11:46.958\nYou can imagine what it was like in the winter at 10,000 feet.\n\n00:11:46.958 --> 00:11:49.958\nYou may recognize a couple of the miners there.\n\n00:11:49.958 --> 00:11:55.958\nThere's Jeff Bezos on the right and Paul Saville on the left looking for galena, \n\n\n00:11:55.958 --> 00:12:00.958\nwhich is the lead-silver thing. They didn't find any.\n\n00:12:00.958 --> 00:12:05.958\nThey both kept their day jobs. Here's the last mine.\n\n00:12:05.958 --> 00:12:07.958\nIt's called the Bonanza Adit. It's down in a canyon.\n\n00:12:07.958 --> 00:12:11.958\nAnd Alexander Rose on the left there worked with a bunch of people\n\n00:12:11.958 --> 00:12:14.958\nfrom the National Park to survey the whole mine. It's a mile deep.\n\n00:12:14.958 --> 00:12:17.958\nAnd they also found four species of bats in there.\n\n00:12:17.958 --> 00:12:21.958\nNow, almost all those mines, by the way, meet underneath the mountain.\n\n00:12:21.958 --> 00:12:24.958\nThey don't quite, but it's something to think about.\n\n00:12:24.958 --> 00:12:26.958\nThey don't quite meet.\n\n00:12:26.958 --> 00:12:32.958\nLet's go to weather. Mountains specialize in interesting weather.\n\n00:12:32.958 --> 00:12:35.958\nWay more interesting than Monterey even today.\n\n00:12:35.958 --> 00:12:38.958\nAnd so one Tuesday morning last June, there we were.\n\n00:12:38.958 --> 00:12:41.958\nWoke up in the morning -- the mountain was covered with snow.\n\n00:12:41.958 --> 00:12:45.958\nThat was a great time to go up and visit our weather station which again,\n\n00:12:45.958 --> 00:12:48.958\nthanks to Mitch Kapor, we're building up there.\n\n00:12:48.958 --> 00:12:51.958\nAnd it's a pretty interesting scene.\n\n00:12:51.958 --> 00:12:54.958\nThis is, on the left there, the joyful lady is Pat Irwin,\n\n00:12:54.958 --> 00:12:57.958\nwho's the regional head of the National Forest Service,\n\n00:12:57.958 --> 00:13:01.958\nand they gave us the temporary use permit to be there.\n\n00:13:01.958 --> 00:13:03.958\nWe want a temporary use permit for the clock, eventually --\n\n00:13:03.958 --> 00:13:05.958\n10,000-year temporary use permit.\n\n00:13:05.958 --> 00:13:07.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:13:07.958 --> 00:13:09.958\nThe weather station's pretty interesting.\n\n00:13:09.958 --> 00:13:13.958\nKurt Bollacker and Alexander Rose designed a radically wireless station.\n\n00:13:13.958 --> 00:13:16.958\nIt runs on solar, and it sends a signal\nwith that antenna\n\n00:13:16.958 --> 00:13:22.958\nand bounces it off of micrometeorite trails in the atmosphere\n\n00:13:22.958 --> 00:13:26.958\nto a place in Bozeman, Montana, where the data is taken down\n\n00:13:26.958 --> 00:13:29.958\nand then sent through landlines to San Francisco,\n\n00:13:29.958 --> 00:13:33.958\nwhere we put the data in real time up on our website.\n\n00:13:33.958 --> 00:13:39.958\nAnd there you see a week of weather at 9,400 feet on Mount Washington.\n\n00:13:39.958 --> 00:13:42.958\nLet's go to approaches.\n\n00:13:42.958 --> 00:13:46.958\nAs it happens, there are no trails anywhere on Mount Washington,\n\n00:13:46.958 --> 00:13:48.958\njust a few old mining roads like this,\n\n00:13:48.958 --> 00:13:49.958\nso you have to bushwhack everywhere.\n\n00:13:49.958 --> 00:13:53.958\nBut there's no bears, and there's no poison oak,\n\n00:13:53.958 --> 00:13:59.958\nand there's basically no people because this place has been empty for a long time. \n\n\n00:13:59.958 --> 00:14:02.958\nYou can hike for days and not encounter anybody.\n\n00:14:02.958 --> 00:14:04.958\nWell, here's a potential approach.\n\n00:14:04.958 --> 00:14:07.958\nYou need to come up the Lincoln Canyon.\n\n00:14:07.958 --> 00:14:10.958\nIt's this beautiful world all of its own, surrounded by cliffs,\n\n00:14:10.958 --> 00:14:14.958\nand it's an easy hike to stroll up the canyon bottom,\n\n00:14:14.958 --> 00:14:21.958\nuntil you get to this barrier, and it actually presents a problem.\n\n00:14:21.958 --> 00:14:26.958\nSo you can scratch Lincoln Canyon as an approach.\n\n00:14:26.958 --> 00:14:29.958\nAnother possible approach is right up the western front of the mountain.\n\n00:14:29.958 --> 00:14:32.958\nYou can see why we sometimes call it Long Mountain.\n\n00:14:32.958 --> 00:14:35.958\nAnd from where you're standing at 6,000 feet in the valley,\n\n00:14:35.958 --> 00:14:38.958\nit's an easy hike up to the mature pinyon and juniper forest\n\n00:14:38.958 --> 00:14:40.958\nthrough that knoll at the front at 7,600 feet.\n\n00:14:40.958 --> 00:14:43.958\nAnd you can carry right on up through meadows\n\n00:14:43.958 --> 00:14:48.958\nand steepening forest to the high base of the cliffs at 10,500 feet,\n\n00:14:48.958 --> 00:14:51.958\nwhere there's a bit of a problem.\n\n00:14:51.958 --> 00:14:56.958\nNow, Jeff Bezos advised us when he left at the end of the expedition,\n\n00:14:56.958 --> 00:15:00.958\n\"Make the clock inaccessible.\n\n00:15:00.958 --> 00:15:04.958\nThe harder it is to get to, the more people will value it.\"\n\n00:15:04.958 --> 00:15:09.958\nAnd check -- those are 600-foot vertical walls there.\n\n00:15:09.958 --> 00:15:14.958\nSo Alexander Rose wanted to explore this route,\n\n00:15:14.958 --> 00:15:18.958\nand he started over here on the left from his pickup truck\n\n00:15:18.958 --> 00:15:21.958\nat 8,900 feet and headed up the mountain.\n\n00:15:21.958 --> 00:15:25.958\nNow, as you gain elevation your IQ goes down --\n\n00:15:25.958 --> 00:15:27.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:15:27.958 --> 00:15:29.958\nbut your emotional affect goes up,\n\n00:15:29.958 --> 00:15:32.958\nwhich is great for having a mythic experience,\n\n\n00:15:32.958 --> 00:15:34.958\nwhether you want to or not.\n\n00:15:34.958 --> 00:15:37.958\nIn fact, Danny Hillis can estimate altitude\n\n00:15:37.958 --> 00:15:40.958\nby how much math he can't do in his head.\n\n00:15:40.958 --> 00:15:43.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:15:43.958 --> 00:15:45.958\nNow, I happened to be on the radio with Alexander\n\n00:15:45.958 --> 00:15:50.958\nwhen he got to this point at the base of the cliffs, and he said, quote, \n\n\n00:15:50.958 --> 00:15:55.958\n\"There's a hidden notch. I think I can get up a ways.\"\n\n00:15:55.958 --> 00:15:59.958\nNow, he's a rock climber, but you know, he's our executive director.\n\n00:15:59.958 --> 00:16:01.958\nI don't want him killed. I know he's going to love cliffs.\n\n00:16:01.958 --> 00:16:04.958\nI'm saying, \"Be careful, be careful, be careful.\"\n\n00:16:04.958 --> 00:16:07.958\nThen he starts going up, and the next thing I hear is,\n\n00:16:07.958 --> 00:16:13.958\n\"I'm half-way up. It's like climbing stairs. I'm going up 60 degrees.\n\n00:16:13.958 --> 00:16:17.958\nIt's a secret passage. It's like something from Tolkien.\"\n\n00:16:17.958 --> 00:16:20.958\nAnd I'm going, \"Careful, careful. Please be careful.\"\n\n00:16:20.958 --> 00:16:21.958\nAnd then, of course, the next thing I hear is,\n\n00:16:21.958 --> 00:16:24.958\n\"I've made it to the top. You can see all of creation from up here.\"\n\n00:16:24.958 --> 00:16:27.958\nAnd he dashed across the top of the mountains.\n\n00:16:27.958 --> 00:16:29.958\nIn fact, there he is. That's Alexander Rose.\n\n00:16:29.958 --> 00:16:32.958\nFirst ascent of the western face to Mount Washington,\n\n00:16:32.958 --> 00:16:36.958\nand a solo ascent at that.\n\n00:16:36.958 --> 00:16:39.958\nThis discovery changed everything about our sense of these cliffs\n\n00:16:39.958 --> 00:16:41.958\nand what to do with them.\n\n00:16:41.958 --> 00:16:45.958\nWe realized that we had to name this thing that Alexander discovered.\n\n00:16:45.958 --> 00:16:49.958\nHow about Zander's Crevice? No.\n\n00:16:49.958 --> 00:16:53.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:16:53.958 --> 00:16:56.958\nSo we finally decided on Alexander's Siq.\n\n00:16:56.958 --> 00:16:59.958\nZander's Siq is named after -- some of you have been to Petra,\n\n00:16:59.958 --> 00:17:03.958\nthere's this wonderful slot canyon that leads into Petra\n\n00:17:03.958 --> 00:17:05.958\ncalled the Siq, and so this is the Siq.\n\n00:17:05.958 --> 00:17:08.958\nAnd it really is hidden. I can't find it in this image,\n\n00:17:08.958 --> 00:17:09.958\nand I'm not sure you can.\n\n00:17:09.958 --> 00:17:13.958\nOnly when you get fresh snow can you see just along the rim there,\n\n00:17:13.958 --> 00:17:15.958\nand that brings it out.\n\n00:17:15.958 --> 00:17:17.958\nNow, Danny and I were up at this same area one day,\n\n00:17:17.958 --> 00:17:19.958\nand Danny looked over to the right\n\n00:17:19.958 --> 00:17:22.958\nand noticed something halfway up the cliffs,\n\n00:17:22.958 --> 00:17:26.958\nwhich is a kind of a porch or a cliff shelf with bristlecones on it,\n\n00:17:26.958 --> 00:17:30.958\nand supposed that people going up to the clock inside the mountain\n\n00:17:30.958 --> 00:17:34.958\ncould come out onto that shelf and look down at the view.\n\n00:17:34.958 --> 00:17:37.958\nAnd the people toiling up the mountain could see them,\n\n00:17:37.958 --> 00:17:40.958\nthese tiny little people up there, incredibly halfway up the cliff.\n\n00:17:40.958 --> 00:17:43.958\nHow did they get there? Do I have to do that?\n\n00:17:43.958 --> 00:17:46.958\nAnd so that maybe becomes part of the draw and part of the labyrinth.\n\n00:17:46.958 --> 00:17:50.958\nYou can get another angle on Danny's porch\n\n00:17:50.958 --> 00:17:57.958\nby going around to the south and looking north at the whole formation there. \n\n\n00:17:57.958 --> 00:18:00.958\nAnd you need to know that Danny's clock is to be kept accurate\n\n00:18:00.958 --> 00:18:05.958\nby a ray of sunshine, that perfect noon hitting it every sunny day,\n\n00:18:05.958 --> 00:18:08.958\nand the pulse of heat from that sets off a solar trigger\n\n00:18:08.958 --> 00:18:11.958\nwhich resets the clock to make it perfectly accurate.\n\n00:18:11.958 --> 00:18:13.958\nSo even with the slowing of the rotation of the earth and so on,\n\n00:18:13.958 --> 00:18:16.958\nthe clock will keep perfectly good time.\n\n00:18:16.958 --> 00:18:18.958\nSo here we're looking from the south, look north.\n\n00:18:18.958 --> 00:18:22.958\nThis is all Forest Service land. If you go up on top of those cliffs,\n\n00:18:22.958 --> 00:18:25.958\nthat's some of the Long Now land in those trees.\n\n00:18:25.958 --> 00:18:30.958\nAnd if you go up there and look back, then you'll get a sense of\n\n00:18:30.958 --> 00:18:33.958\nwhat the view starts to be like from the top of the mountain.\n\n00:18:33.958 --> 00:18:37.958\nThat's the long view. That's 80 miles to the horizon.\n\n00:18:37.958 --> 00:18:41.958\nAnd that's also timberline and those bristlecones really are shrubs.\n\n00:18:41.958 --> 00:18:49.958\nThat's a different place to be. It's 11,400 feet and it's exquisite.\n\n00:18:49.958 --> 00:18:53.958\nNow, if you go over to the right from this image to looking at the edge of the cliffs,\n\n00:18:53.958 --> 00:18:57.958\nit's 600 foot, just about a yard to the left of Kurt Bollacker's foot,\n\n00:18:57.958 --> 00:19:02.958\nthere is a 600-foot drop. He's ambling on over to Zander's Siq.\n\n00:19:02.958 --> 00:19:06.958\nThat's what it looks like looking down it.\n\n00:19:06.958 --> 00:19:10.958\nWe should probably put in a rail or something.\n\n00:19:10.958 --> 00:19:14.958\nOver on the eastern side it's gentle, as you can see.\n\n00:19:14.958 --> 00:19:17.958\nAnd that's not snow -- that's what the white limestone looks like.\n\n00:19:17.958 --> 00:19:21.958\nYou also see there a bighorn sheep.\n\n00:19:21.958 --> 00:19:24.958\nTheir herd was reintroduced from Wyoming.\n\n00:19:24.958 --> 00:19:27.958\nAnd they're doing pretty well, but they've got a bit of trouble.\n\n00:19:27.958 --> 00:19:30.958\nThis is Danny Hillis, and he's figuring out a design problem.\n\n00:19:30.958 --> 00:19:35.958\nhe's trying to determine if where he is on a bit of Long Now land\n\n00:19:35.958 --> 00:19:41.958\nwould appear from down in the valley to be the actual peak of the mountain.\n\n00:19:41.958 --> 00:19:43.958\nbecause the real peak is hidden around the corner.\n\n00:19:43.958 --> 00:19:47.958\nThis is what in the infantry we used to call the military crest.\n\n00:19:47.958 --> 00:19:50.958\nAnd as it turned out the answer is, yes,\n\n00:19:50.958 --> 00:19:54.958\nthat is from down below in the valley it does look like the peak,\n\n00:19:54.958 --> 00:19:56.958\nand that might be conjured with.\n\n00:19:56.958 --> 00:20:01.958\nWe gradually realized we have three serious design domains to work on with this.\n\n00:20:01.958 --> 00:20:03.958\nOne is the experience of the mountain.\n\n00:20:03.958 --> 00:20:06.958\nAnother is the experience in the mountain.\n\n00:20:06.958 --> 00:20:09.958\nAnd the third is the experience from the mountain,\n\n00:20:09.958 --> 00:20:12.958\nwhich is really dominated by the view shed\n\n00:20:12.958 --> 00:20:16.958\nof the spring valley there behind Danny,\n\n00:20:16.958 --> 00:20:18.958\nand if you look off to the right, out there,\n\n00:20:18.958 --> 00:20:22.958\n15 miles across to the Schell Creek range.\n\n00:20:22.958 --> 00:20:25.958\nIn the front, there are 10 ranches strung right along the base of the mountains\n\n00:20:25.958 --> 00:20:27.958\nusing the water from the mountains.\n\n00:20:27.958 --> 00:20:32.958\nIn fact, there are artesian wells where water springs right into the air.\n\n00:20:32.958 --> 00:20:35.958\nOne of the ranches is called the Kirkeby Ranch,\n\n00:20:35.958 --> 00:20:37.958\nand I'll take you there for a minute.\n\n00:20:37.958 --> 00:20:39.958\nIt's a very nice ranch.\n\n00:20:39.958 --> 00:20:44.958\nAlfalfa and cattle, run by Paul and Ronnie Brenham,\n\n00:20:44.958 --> 00:20:49.958\nand it's pretty idyllic. It's also hard work.\n\n00:20:49.958 --> 00:20:51.958\nAnd most of these ranches are having trouble keeping going.\n\n00:20:51.958 --> 00:20:55.958\nThis is their view to the west of the Schell Creek range.\n\n00:20:55.958 --> 00:20:58.958\nAnd if you go out to that line of trees at the far end,\n\n00:20:58.958 --> 00:21:02.958\nyou'll see what the valley used to look like.\n\n00:21:02.958 --> 00:21:07.958\nThis is Rocky Mountain junipers that have been there for thousands of years.\n\n00:21:07.958 --> 00:21:10.958\nAnd a scheme emerged that Long Now is looking to see\n\n00:21:10.958 --> 00:21:13.958\nif it might be possible to buy up the whole valley,\n\n00:21:13.958 --> 00:21:17.958\nbecause those 10 ranches with their 17,000 acres\n\n00:21:17.958 --> 00:21:22.958\ndominate a 500 square mile valley with their grazing allotments and so on, \n\n\n00:21:22.958 --> 00:21:25.958\nand there's a possibility that you could get the whole thing\n\n00:21:25.958 --> 00:21:29.958\nfor five million dollars and gradually restore it to its wild condition,\n\n00:21:29.958 --> 00:21:33.958\nand somewhere in the process turn it back over to the National Park,\n\n00:21:33.958 --> 00:21:37.958\nand it would double the size of Great Basin National Park. That would be swell.\n\n00:21:37.958 --> 00:21:40.958\nOK, let's take one more look at the mountain itself.\n\n00:21:40.958 --> 00:21:44.958\nThe clock experience should be profound,\n\n00:21:44.958 --> 00:21:48.958\nbut from the outside it should be invisible.\n\n00:21:48.958 --> 00:21:52.958\nNow, at the base of the high cliffs there's this natural cave.\n\n00:21:52.958 --> 00:21:56.958\nIt's only about 12 feet deep, but what if it were deepened from inside?\n\n00:21:56.958 --> 00:21:59.958\nYou excavated from somewhere, came up from inside and deepened it.\n\n00:21:59.958 --> 00:22:00.958\nAnd then you could have an entrance\n\n00:22:00.958 --> 00:22:03.958\nwhich was very rough and narrow as you first went in,\n\n00:22:03.958 --> 00:22:07.958\nthat gradually becomes more refined and then actually quite exquisite.\n\n00:22:07.958 --> 00:22:10.958\nAnd this stone takes a perfect polish.\n\n00:22:10.958 --> 00:22:15.958\nYou'd have a polished set of passages and chambers in there\n\n00:22:15.958 --> 00:22:19.958\neventually leading to the 10,000 year clock.\n\n00:22:19.958 --> 00:22:23.958\nAnd it's not a mine. This would be a nuanced evocation\n\n00:22:23.958 --> 00:22:26.958\nof the basic structure of the mountain,\n\n00:22:26.958 --> 00:22:29.958\nand you would be appreciating it as much from inside as you do from outside. \n\n\n00:22:29.958 --> 00:22:32.958\nThis is architecture not made by building,\n\n00:22:32.958 --> 00:22:36.958\nbut by what you very carefully take away.\n\n00:22:36.958 --> 00:22:39.958\nSo that's what the mountain taught us.\n\n00:22:39.958 --> 00:22:42.958\nMost of the amazingness of the clock\n\n00:22:42.958 --> 00:22:46.958\nwe can borrow from the amazingness of the mountain.\n\n00:22:46.958 --> 00:22:50.958\nAll we have to do is highlight its spectacular features and blend in with them.\n\n00:22:50.958 --> 00:22:55.958\nIt's not a clock in a mountain -- it's a mountain clock.\n\n00:22:55.958 --> 00:22:57.958\nNow, the Tewa Indians in the Southwest have a saying\n\n00:22:57.958 --> 00:23:03.958\nfor what you need to do when you want to think long term about anything.\n\n00:23:03.958 --> 00:23:10.958\nThey say, \"pin peya obe\" -- welcome to the mountain.\n\n00:23:10.958 --> 00:23:12.958\nThank you.\n\n00:23:12.958 --> 00:23:17.958\n(Applause)"}, {"title": "Fashion and creativity", "duration": "856", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/isaac_mizrahi_on_fashion_and_creativity", "transcript": "I have, like, a thing about sleeping. I don't sleep that much, and I've come to this thing about, like, not sleeping much as being a great virtue, after years of kind of battling it as being a terrible detriment, or something. And now I really like sort of sitting up, you know. But for years I've been sitting up and I think that, like, my creativity is greatly motivated by this kind of insomnia. I lie awake. I think thoughts. I walk aimlessly. Sometimes I used to walk more at night. I walk during the day and I follow people who I think look interesting. (Laughter)And sometimes \u2014 actually, once it was on Page Six in the Post, that I was cruising this guy, like, sort of, whatever, but I was actually just following because he had these really great shoes on. And so I was following this guy. And I took a picture of his shoes, and we thanked each other and just went on our way. But I do that all the time. As a matter of fact, I think a lot of my design ideas come from mistakes and tricks of the eye. Because I feel like, you know, there are so many images out there, so many clothes out there. And the only ones that look interesting to me are the ones that look slightly mistaken, of course, or very, very surprising. And often, I'm driving in a taxi and I see a hole in a shirt, or something that looks very interesting or pretty or functional in some way that I'd never seen happen before. And so I'd make the car stop, and I'd get out of the car and walk, and see that in fact there wasn't a hole, but it was a trick of my eye, it was a shadow, you know. Or if there was a hole I'd think like, oh damn, there was actually someone thought of that thought already. Someone made that mistake already so I can't do it anymore.I don't know where inspiration comes from. It does not come for me from research. I don't get necessarily inspired by research. As a matter of fact, one of the most fun things I've ever, ever done in my whole life, was this Christmas season at the Guggenheim in New York. I read \"Peter and the Wolf\" with this beautiful band from Juilliard. And I did like, you know, the narrator, and I read it. And I saw this really smart critic who I love. This woman, Joan Acocella, who's a friend of mine, and she came backstage and she said, oh, you know, Isaac, did you know that, talking about Stalinism and talking about, you know, like the '30s in Russia. And I said, how do I know about Stalinism? I know about a wolf and a bird and, you know, he ate the bird, and then in the end you hear, you know, you hear the bird squeaking, or something, you know?So I don't really know that. I don't really \u2014 actually I do my own kind of research, you know. If I'm commissioned to do the costumes for an 18th-century opera, or something like that, I will do a lot of research, because it's interesting, not because it's what I'm supposed to do. I'm very, very, very inspired by movies. The color of movies and the way light makes the colors, light from behind the projection, or light from the projection, makes the colors look so impossible. And anyway, roll this little clip, I'll just show you. I sit up at night and I watch movies and I watch women in movies a lot. And I think about, you know, their roles, and about how you have to, like, watch what your daughters look at. Because I look at the way women are portrayed all the time. Whether they're kind of glorified in this way, or whether they're kind of, you know, ironically glorified, or whether they're, you know, sort of denigrated, or ironically denigrated.I go back to color all the time. Color is something that motivates me a lot. It's rarely color that I find in nature, although, you know, juxtaposed next to artificial color, natural color is so beautiful. So that's what I do. I study color a lot. But for the most part, I think, like, how can I ever make anything that is as beautiful as that image of Natalie Wood? How can I ever make anything as beautiful as Greta Garbo? I mean, that's just not possible, you know. And so that's what makes me lie awake at night, I guess, you know. I want to show you \u2014 I'm also like a big \u2014 I go to astrologers and tarot card readers often, and that's another thing that motivates me a lot. People say, oh, do that. An astrologer tells me to do something. So I do it. (Laughter)When I was about 21, an astrologer told me that I was going to meet the man of my dreams, and that his name was going to be Eric, right? So, you know, for years I would go to bars and, sort of, anyone I met whose name was Eric I was humping immediately, or something. (Laughter) And there were times when I was actually so desperate I would just, you know, walk into a room and just go like, \"Eric!\" And anybody who would turn around I would, sort of, make a beeline for. (Laughter) And I had this really interesting tarot reading a long time ago. The last card he pulled, which was representing my destiny was this guy on like a straw boater with a cane and you know, sort of spats and this, you know, a minstrel singer, right? I want to show you this clip because I do this kind of crazy thing where I do a cabaret act. So actually, check this out. Very embarrassing. (Video): Thank you. We can do anything you ask.The name of the show is based on this story that I have to tell you about my mother. It's sort of an excerpt from a quote of hers. I was dating this guy, right? And this has to do with being happy, I swear. I was dating this guy and it was going on for about a year, right. And we were getting serious, so we decided to invite them all to dinner, our parents. And we, you know, sort of introduced them to each other. My mother was, sort of, very sensitive to his mother, who it seemed was a little bit skeptical about the whole alternative lifestyle thing. You know, homosexuality, right? So my mother was a little offended. She turned to her and she said, \"Are you kidding? They have the greatest life together. They eat out, they see shows.\" They eat out, they see shows. (Laughter) That's the name of the show, they eat out, they \u2014 that's on my tombstone when I die. \"He ate out, he saw shows,\" right?So in editing these clips, I didn't have the audacity to edit a clip of me singing at Joe's Pub. So you'll have to, like, go check it out and come see me or something. Because it's mortifying, and yet it feels ... I don't know how to put this. I feel as little comfort as possible is a good thing, you know. And at least, you know, in my case, because if I just do one thing all the time, I don't know, I get very, very bored. I bore very easily. And you know, I don't say that I do everything well, I just say that I do a lot of things, that's all. And I kind of try not to look back, you know. Except, I guess, that's what staying up every night is about. Like, looking back and thinking, what a fool you made of yourself, you know. But I guess that's okay. Right? Because if you do many things you get to feel lousy about everything, and not just one, you know. You don't master feeling lousy about one thing. Yeah, exactly.I will show you this next thing, speaking of costumes for operas. I do work with different choreographers. I work with Twyla Tharp a lot, and I work with Mark Morris a lot, who is one of my best friends. And I designed three operas with him, and the most recent one, \"King Arthur.\" I'd been very ingrained in the dance world since I was a teenager. I went to performing arts high school, where I was an actor. And many of my friends were ballet dancers. Again, I don't know where inspiration comes from. I don't know where it comes from. I started making puppets when I was a kid. Maybe that's where the whole inspiration thing started from, puppets, right. And then performing arts high school. There I was in high school, meeting dancers and acting.And somehow, from there, I got interested in design. I went to Parsons School of Design and then I began my career as a designer. I don't really think of myself as a designer, I don't really think of myself necessarily as a fashion designer. And frankly, I don't really know what to call myself. I think of myself as a ... I don't know what I think of myself as. It's just that. (Laughter) But I must say, this whole thing about being slightly bored all the time, that is what \u2014 I think that is a very important thing for a fashion designer. You always have to be slightly bored with everything. And if you're not, you have to pretend to be slightly bored with everything. (Laughter)But I am really a little bored with everything. I always say to my partner, Marisa Gardini, who books everything \u2014 she books everything and she makes everything happen. And she makes all the deals. And I always tell her that I find myself with a lot of time on the computer bridge program. Too much time on computer bridge, which is, you know, like that's so ... somehow, like, about ten years ago I thought that the most unboring place in the world would be like a T.V. studio, like for a day show. Some kind of day talk show. Because it's all of these things that I love all kind of in one place. And if you ever get bored you can look at another thing, and do another thing and talk about it, right?And so I had this T.V. show. And that was a very, very, very big part of my process. Actually, could you roll the clip, please? This is one of my favorite clips of Rosie.(Video) Isaac Mizrahi: We're back on the set. Hi there.Rosie O'Donnell: Hello, Ben.IM: Look how cute she looks with this, just a slick back.Man: Her grandmother says, \"Delish!\"IM: Ah, wow, delish. All right. So now where should I position myself? I want to stay out of the way. I don't want to be \u2014 okay. Here we go. Do you get nervous, Ashleigh?Ashleigh: Doing what? ROD: Cutting hair.A: Cutting hair? Never, never. I don't think there was ever a day where I cut hair I was nervous. IM: You look so cute already, by the way. ROD: You like it? All right. IM: Do you have a problem with looking cute? You want to look cute.ROD: Of course I want to look cute. IM: Just checking, because some people want to look, you know, aggressively ugly.ROD: No, not me, no.IM: You read about all these people who have a lot of money and they have kids and the kids always end up somehow, like, really messed up, you know what I mean? And there's got to be some way to do that, Rosie. Because just because if you're fabulously rich, and fabulously famous, does that mean you shouldn't have kids, because you know they're going to end up getting messed up?ROD: No, but it means that your priority has to be their well-being first, I think. But you have to make the decision for yourself. My kids are seven, who the hell knows. They're going to be like 14 and in rehab. And they're going to be playing this clip: \"I'm such a good mother.\" My God, this is the shortest I've ever had.IM: It looks good, yeah?A: I was going to ask you, has your hair ever been \u2014ROD: No! It's all right \u2014 go crazy.IM: I feel like it needs to be a little closer down here.A: Oh no, we're just staging,ROD: We're just staging it.IM: Are you freaking out? You look so cute.ROD: No, I love it. It's the new me.IM: Oh, it's so fabulous!ROD: Flock of Rosie. Wooo!IM: So by the way. Of all the most unboring things in the world, right. I mean, like making someone who's already cute look terrible like that. That is not boring. That is nothing if it's not boring. Actually, I read this great quote the other day, which was, \"Style makes you feel great because it takes your mind off the fact that you're going to die.\" Right? And then I realized, that was on my website, and then it said, like, you know, the quote was attributed to me and I thought, oh, I said something, you know, in an interview. I forgot that I said that. But it's really true.I want to show you this last clip because it's going to be my last goodbye. I'll tell you that I cook a lot also. I love to cook. And I often look at things as though they're food. Like I say, oh, you know, would you serve a rotten chicken? Then how could you serve, you know, a beat up old dress or something. How could you show a beat up old dress? I always relate things to kitchen-ry. And so I think that's what it all boils down to. Everything boils down to that.So check this out. This is what I've been doing because I think it's the most fun thing in the world. It's, like, this website. It's got a lot of different things on it. It's a polymathematical website. We actually shoot segments like T.V. show segments. And it's kind of my favorite thing in the world. And it just began like in the beginning of February. So who knows? And again, I don't say it's good, I just think it's not boring, right? And here is the last bit.(Video) IM: I have to tell you, I make buttermilk pancakes or buttermilk waffles all the time.Chef: Do you?IM: Yeah, but I can never find buttermilk, ever.Chef: Oh.IM: You can't find buttermilk at Citarella; you can't find buttermilk.Chef: You can't? IM: It's always low-fat buttermilk.Chef: No, but that's all it is. IM: Is that all it is?Chef: Oh, you don't know? Let me tell you something. Let me tell you something interesting.IM: You know what? Stop laughing. It's not funny. Just because I don't know that whole \u2014 that there's no such thing as whole buttermilk. Sorry, what?Chef: Well, here's the deal. Let me tell you the deal. In the old days when they used to make butter, you know how you make butter?IM: Churns?Chef: For cream?IM: Yeah, exactly.Chef: So you take heavy, high-fat milk, which is cream, and you churn it until it separates into these curds and water. The liquid is actually that clear liquid. If you've ever overbeaten your whipped cream, it's actually buttermilk. And that's what it was in the early days. And that's what people used for baking and all sorts of things. Now, the buttermilk that you get is actually low-fat or skim milk.IM: Excuse me, I didn't know. All right?Chef: The reason he thought that is because buttermilk is so wonderfully thick and delicious.IM: Yeah, it is, exactly. So who would think that it was low-fat?Well, that's it. Thank you very much. Happy TED. It's so wonderful here. I love it. I love it. I love it. Thanks.

I don't really --\n\n00:02:43.958 --> 00:02:46.958\nactually I do my own kind of research, you know.\n\n00:02:46.958 --> 00:02:51.958\nIf I'm commissioned to do the costumes for an 18th-century opera, or something like that,\n\n00:02:51.958 --> 00:02:54.958\nI will do a lot of research, because it's interesting,\n\n00:02:54.958 --> 00:02:56.958\nnot because it's what I'm supposed to do.\n\n00:02:56.958 --> 00:02:59.958\nI'm very, very, very inspired by movies.\n\n00:02:59.958 --> 00:03:03.958\nThe color of movies and the way light makes the colors,\n\n00:03:03.958 --> 00:03:05.958\nlight from behind the projection,\n\n00:03:05.958 --> 00:03:10.958\nor light from the projection, makes the colors look so impossible.\n\n00:03:10.958 --> 00:03:13.958\nAnd anyway, roll this little clip, I'll just show you.\n\n00:03:13.958 --> 00:03:16.958\nI sit up at night and I watch movies\n\n00:03:16.958 --> 00:03:19.958\nand I watch women in movies a lot.\n\n00:03:19.958 --> 00:03:22.958\nAnd I think about, you know, their roles,\n\n00:03:22.958 --> 00:03:26.958\nand about how you have to, like, watch what your daughters look at.\n\n00:03:26.958 --> 00:03:30.958\nBecause I look at the way women are portrayed all the time.\n\n00:03:30.958 --> 00:03:33.958\nWhether they're kind of glorified in this way,\n\n00:03:33.958 --> 00:03:38.958\nor whether they're kind of, you know, ironically glorified,\n\n00:03:38.958 --> 00:03:44.958\nor whether they're, you know, sort of denigrated, or ironically denigrated.\n\n00:03:44.958 --> 00:03:46.958\nI go back to color all the time.\n\n00:03:46.958 --> 00:03:50.958\nColor is something that motivates me a lot.\n\n00:03:50.958 --> 00:03:56.958\nIt's rarely color that I find in nature,\n\n00:03:56.958 --> 00:04:02.958\nalthough, you know, juxtaposed next to artificial color,\n\n00:04:02.958 --> 00:04:04.958\nnatural color is so beautiful.\n\n00:04:04.958 --> 00:04:06.958\nSo that's what I do. I study color a lot.\n\n00:04:06.958 --> 00:04:13.958\nBut for the most part, I think, like, how can I ever make anything\n\n00:04:13.958 --> 00:04:16.958\nthat is as beautiful as that image of Natalie Wood?\n\n00:04:16.958 --> 00:04:20.958\nHow can I ever make anything as beautiful as Greta Garbo?\n\n00:04:20.958 --> 00:04:23.958\nI mean, that's just not possible, you know.\n\n00:04:24.958 --> 00:04:28.958\nAnd so that's what makes me lie awake at night, I guess, you know.\n\n00:04:28.958 --> 00:04:31.958\nI want to show you -- I'm also like a big --\n\n00:04:31.958 --> 00:04:35.958\nI go to astrologers and tarot card readers often,\n\n00:04:35.958 --> 00:04:37.958\nand that's another thing that motivates me a lot.\n\n00:04:37.958 --> 00:04:41.958\nPeople say, oh, do that. An astrologer tells me to do something.\n\n00:04:41.958 --> 00:04:42.958\nSo I do it.\n\n00:04:42.958 --> 00:04:43.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:04:43.958 --> 00:04:47.958\nWhen I was about 21, an astrologer told me\n\n00:04:47.958 --> 00:04:49.958\nthat I was going to meet the man of my dreams,\n\n00:04:49.958 --> 00:04:52.958\nand that his name was going to be Eric, right?\n\n00:04:52.958 --> 00:04:54.958\nSo, you know, for years I would go to bars\n\n00:04:54.958 --> 00:04:56.958\nand, sort of, anyone I met whose name was Eric\n\n00:04:56.958 --> 00:04:59.958\nI was humping immediately, or something.\n\n00:04:59.958 --> 00:05:01.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:05:01.958 --> 00:05:02.958\nAnd there were times when I was actually so desperate\n\n00:05:02.958 --> 00:05:04.958\nI would just, you know, walk into a room and just go like, \"Eric!\"\n\n00:05:04.958 --> 00:05:06.958\nAnd anybody who would turn around I would, sort of, make a beeline for.\n\n00:05:06.958 --> 00:05:09.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:05:09.958 --> 00:05:13.958\nAnd I had this really interesting tarot reading a long time ago.\n\n00:05:13.958 --> 00:05:16.958\nThe last card he pulled, which was representing my destiny\n\n00:05:16.958 --> 00:05:18.958\nwas this guy on like a straw boater with a cane\n\n00:05:18.958 --> 00:05:22.958\nand you know, sort of spats and this, you know, a minstrel singer, right?\n\n00:05:22.958 --> 00:05:24.958\nI want to show you this clip because I do this kind of crazy thing\n\n00:05:24.958 --> 00:05:27.958\nwhere I do a cabaret act.\n\n00:05:27.958 --> 00:05:29.958\nSo actually, check this out.\n\n00:05:29.958 --> 00:05:30.958\nVery embarrassing.\n\n00:05:31.958 --> 00:05:34.958\n(Video): Thank you. We can do anything you ask.\n\n00:05:34.958 --> 00:05:40.958\nThe name of the show is based on this story\n\n00:05:40.958 --> 00:05:41.958\nthat I have to tell you about my mother.\n\n00:05:41.958 --> 00:05:44.958\nIt's sort of an excerpt from a quote of hers.\n\n00:05:44.958 --> 00:05:45.958\nI was dating this guy, right?\n\n00:05:45.958 --> 00:05:49.958\nAnd this has to do with being happy, I swear.\n\n00:05:49.958 --> 00:05:55.958\nI was dating this guy and it was going on for about a year, right.\n\n00:05:55.958 --> 00:05:56.958\nAnd we were getting serious,\n\n00:05:56.958 --> 00:05:58.958\nso we decided to invite them all to dinner, our parents.\n\n00:05:58.958 --> 00:05:59.958\nAnd we, you know, sort of introduced them to each other.\n\n00:05:59.958 --> 00:06:03.958\nMy mother was, sort of, very sensitive to his mother,\n\n00:06:03.958 --> 00:06:08.958\nwho it seemed was a little bit skeptical about the whole alternative lifestyle thing.\n\n00:06:08.958 --> 00:06:10.958\nYou know, homosexuality, right?\n\n00:06:10.958 --> 00:06:12.958\nSo my mother was a little offended. She turned to her and she said,\n\n00:06:12.958 --> 00:06:15.958\n\"Are you kidding? They have the greatest life together.\n\n00:06:15.958 --> 00:06:18.958\nThey eat out, they see shows.\"\n\n00:06:18.958 --> 00:06:20.958\nThey eat out, they see shows.\n\n00:06:20.958 --> 00:06:22.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:06:22.958 --> 00:06:23.958\nThat's the name of the show, they eat out, they --\n\n00:06:23.958 --> 00:06:25.958\nthat's on my tombstone when I die.\n\n00:06:25.958 --> 00:06:28.958\n\"He ate out, he saw shows,\" right?\n\n00:06:31.958 --> 00:06:34.958\nSo in editing these clips, I didn't have the audacity\n\n00:06:34.958 --> 00:06:38.958\nto edit a clip of me singing at Joe's Pub.\n\n00:06:38.958 --> 00:06:40.958\nSo you'll have to, like, go check it out and come see me or something.\n\n00:06:40.958 --> 00:06:46.958\nBecause it's mortifying, and yet it feels ...\n\n00:06:46.958 --> 00:06:47.958\nI don't know how to put this.\n\n00:06:47.958 --> 00:06:53.958\nI feel as little comfort as possible is a good thing, you know.\n\n00:06:53.958 --> 00:06:57.958\nAnd at least, you know, in my case,\n\n00:06:57.958 --> 00:07:00.958\nbecause if I just do one thing all the time,\n\n00:07:00.958 --> 00:07:06.958\nI don't know, I get very, very bored.

It's an extremely famous map among cartography nerds, because down here at the bottom of the Catskill Mountains, there is a little town called Roscoe \u2014 actually, this will go easier if I just put it up here \u2014 There's Roscoe, and then right above Roscoe is Rockland, New York, and then right above that is the tiny town of Agloe, New York.Agloe, New York, is very famous to cartographers, because it's a paper town. It's also known as a copyright trap. Mapmakers \u2014 because my map of New York and your map of New York are going to look very similar, on account of the shape of New York \u2014 often, mapmakers will insert fake places onto their maps, in order to protect their copyright. Because then, if my fake place shows up on your map, I can be well and truly sure that you have robbed me. Agloe is a scrabblization of the initials of the two guys who made this map, Ernest Alpers and Otto [G.] Lindberg, and they released this map in 1937. Decades later, Rand McNally releases a map with Agloe, New York, on it, at the same exact intersection of two dirt roads in the middle of nowhere. Well, you can imagine the delight over at General Drafting. They immediately call Rand McNally, and they say, \"We've caught you! We made Agloe, New York, up. It is a fake place. It's a paper town. We're going to sue your pants off!\" And Rand McNally says, \"No, no, no, no, Agloe is real.\" Because people kept going to that intersection of two dirt roads \u2014(Laughter)in the middle of nowhere, expecting there to be a place called Agloe \u2014 someone built a place called Agloe, New York.(Laughter)It had a gas station, a general store, two houses at its peak.(Laughter)And this is of course a completely irresistible metaphor to a novelist, because we would all like to believe that the stuff that we write down on paper can change the actual world in which we're actually living, which is why my third book is called \"Paper Towns\".But what interests me ultimately more than the medium in which this happened, is the phenomenon itself. It's easy enough to say that the world shapes our maps of the world, right? Like the overall shape of the world is obviously going to affect our maps. But what I find a lot more interesting is the way that the manner in which we map the world changes the world. Because the world would truly be a different place if North were down. And the world would be a truly different place if Alaska and Russia weren't on opposite sides of the map. And the world would be a different place if we projected Europe to show it in its actual size. The world is changed by our maps of the world. The way that we choose \u2014 sort of, our personal cartographic enterprise, also shapes the map of our lives, and that in turn shapes our lives.I believe that what we map changes the life we lead. And I don't mean that in some, like, secret-y Oprah's Angels network, like, you-can-think-your-way- out-of-cancer sense. But I do believe that while maps don't show you where you will go in your life, they show you where you might go. You very rarely go to a place that isn't on your personal map.So I was a really terrible student when I was a kid. My GPA was consistently in the low 2s. And I think the reason that I was such a terrible student is that I felt like education was just a series of hurdles that had been erected before me, and I had to jump over in order to achieve adulthood. And I didn't really want to jump over these hurdles, because they seemed completely arbitrary, so I often wouldn't, and then people would threaten me, you know, they'd threaten me with this \"going on [my] permanent record,\" or \"You'll never get a good job.\" I didn't want a good job! As far as I could tell at eleven or twelve years old, like, people with good jobs woke up very early in the morning,(Laughter)and the men who had good jobs, one of the first things they did was tie a strangulation item of clothing around their necks. They literally put nooses on themselves, and then they went off to their jobs, whatever they were. That's not a recipe for a happy life. These people \u2014 in my, symbol-obsessed, twelve year-old imagination \u2014 these people who are strangling themselves as one of the first things they do each morning, they can't possibly be happy. Why would I want to jump over all of these hurdles and have that be the end? That's a terrible end!And then, when I was in tenth grade, I went to this school, Indian Springs School, a small boarding school, outside of Birmingham, Alabama. And all at once I became a learner. And I became a learner, because I found myself in a community of learners. I found myself surrounded by people who celebrated intellectualism and engagement, and who thought that my ironic oh-so-cool disengagement wasn't clever, or funny, but, like, it was a simple and unspectacular response to very complicated and compelling problems. And so I started to learn, because learning was cool. I learned that some infinite sets are bigger than other infinite sets, and I learned that iambic pentameter is and why it sounds so good to human ears. I learned that the Civil War was a nationalizing conflict, I learned some physics, I learned that correlation shouldn't be confused with causation \u2014 all of these things, by the way, enriched my life on a literally daily basis. And it's true that I don't use most of them for my \"job,\" but that's not what it's about for me. It's about cartography.What is the process of cartography? It's, you know, sailing upon some land, and thinking, \"I think I'll draw that bit of land,\" and then wondering, \"Maybe there's some more land to draw.\" And that's when learning really began for me. It's true that I had teachers that didn't give up on me, and I was very fortunate to have those teachers, because I often gave them cause to think there was no reason to invest in me. But a lot of the learning that I did in high school wasn't about what happened inside the classroom, it was about what happened outside of the classroom. For instance, I can tell you that \"There's a certain Slant of light, Winter Afternoons \u2014 That oppresses, like the Heft Of Cathedral Tunes \u2014\" not because I memorized Emily Dickinson in school when I was in high school, but because there was a girl when I was in high school, and her name was Amanda, and I had a crush on her, and she liked Emily Dickinson poetry. The reason I can tell you what opportunity cost is, is because one day when I was playing Super Mario Kart on my couch, my friend Emmet walked in, and he said, \"How long have you been playing Super Mario Kart?\" And I said, \"I don't know, like, six hours?\" and he said, \"Do you realize that if you'd worked at Baskin-Robbins those six hours, you could have made 30 dollars, so in some ways, you just paid thirty dollars to play Super Mario Kart.\" And I was, like, \"I'll take that deal.\"(Laughter)But I learned what opportunity cost is.And along the way, the map of my life got better. It got bigger; it contained more places. There were more things that might happen, more futures I might have. It wasn't a formal, organized learning process, and I'm happy to admit that. It was spotty, it was inconsistent, there was a lot I didn't know. I might know, you know, Cantor's idea that some infinite sets are larger than other infinite sets, but I didn't really understand the calculus behind that idea. I might know the idea of opportunity cost, but I didn't know the law of diminishing returns. But the great thing about imagining learning as cartography, instead of imagining it as arbitrary hurdles that you have to jump over, is that you see a bit of coastline, and that makes you want to see more. And so now I do know at least some of the calculus that underlies all of that stuff.So, I had one learning community in high school, then I went to another for college, and then I went to another, when I started working at a magazine called \"Booklist,\" where I was an assistant, surrounded by astonishingly well-read people. And then I wrote a book. And like all authors dream of doing, I promptly quit my job.(Laughter)And for the first time since high school, I found myself without a learning community, and it was miserable. I hated it. I read many, many books during this two-year period. I read books about Stalin, and books about how the Uzbek people came to identify as Muslims, and I read books about how to make atomic bombs, but it just felt like I was creating my own hurdles, and then jumping over them myself, instead of feeling the excitement of being part of a community of learners, a community of people who are engaged together in the cartographic enterprise of trying to better understand and map the world around us.And then, in 2006, I met that guy. His name is Ze Frank. I didn't actually meet him, just on the Internet. Ze Frank was running, at the time, a show called \"The Show with Ze Frank,\" and I discovered the show, and that was my way back into being a community learner again. Here's Ze talking about Las Vegas:(Video) Ze Frank: Las Vegas was built in the middle of a huge, hot desert. Almost everything here was brought from somewhere else \u2014 the sort of rocks, the trees, the waterfalls. These fish are almost as out of place as my pig that flew. Contrasted to the scorching desert that surrounds this place, so are these people. Things from all over the world have been rebuilt here, away from their histories, and away from the people that experience them differently. Sometimes improvements were made \u2014 even the Sphinx got a nose job. Here, there's no reason to feel like you're missing anything. This New York means the same to me as it does to everyone else. Everything is out of context, and that means context allows for everything: Self Parking, Events Center, Shark Reef. This fabrication of place could be one of the world's greatest achievements, because no one belongs here; everyone does. As I walked around this morning, I noticed most of the buildings were huge mirrors reflecting the sun back into the desert. But unlike most mirrors, which present you with an outside view of yourself embedded in a place, these mirrors come back empty.John Green: Makes me nostalgic for the days when you could see the pixels in online video.(Laughter)Ze isn't just a great public intellectual, he's also a brilliant community builder, and the community of people that built up around these videos was in many ways a community of learners. So we played Ze Frank at chess collaboratively, and we beat him. We organized ourselves to take a young man on a road trip across the United States. We turned the Earth into a sandwich, by having one person hold a piece of bread at one point on the Earth, and on the exact opposite point of the Earth, have another person holding a piece of bread. I realize that these are silly ideas, but they are also \"learny\" ideas, and that was what was so exciting to me, and if you go online, you can find communities like this all over the place. Follow the calculus tag on Tumblr, and yes, you will see people complaining about calculus, but you'll also see people re-blogging those complaints, making the argument that calculus is interesting and beautiful, and here's a way in to thinking about the problem that you find unsolvable. You can go to places like Reddit, and find sub-Reddits, like \"Ask a Historian\" or \"Ask Science,\" where you can ask people who are in these fields a wide range of questions, from very serious ones to very silly ones. But to me, the most interesting communities of learners that are growing up on the Internet right now are on YouTube, and admittedly, I am biased. But I think in a lot of ways, the YouTube page resembles a classroom. Look for instance at \"Minute Physics,\" a guy who's teaching the world about physics:(Video) Let's cut to the chase. As of July 4, 2012, the Higgs boson is the last fundamental piece of the standard model of particle physics to be discovered experimentally. But, you might ask, why was the Higgs boson included in the standard model, alongside well-known particles like electrons and photons and quarks, if it hadn't been discovered back then in the 1970s? Good question. There are two main reasons. First, just like the electron is an excitation in the electron field, the Higgs boson is simply a particle which is an excitation of the everywhere-permeating Higgs field. The Higgs field in turn plays an integral role in our model for the weak nuclear force. In particular, the Higgs field helps explain why it's so weak. We'll talk more about this in a later video, but even though weak nuclear theory was confirmed in the 1980s, in the equations, the Higgs field is so inextricably jumbled with the weak force, that until now we've been unable to confirm its actual and independent existence.JG: Or here's a video that I made as part of my show \"Crash Course,\" talking about World War I:(Video) The immediate cause was of course the assassination in Sarajevo of the Austrian Archduke Franz Ferdinand, on June 28, 1914, by a Bosnian-Serb nationalist named Gavrilo Princip. Quick aside: It's worth noting that the first big war of the twentieth century began with an act of terrorism. So Franz Ferdinand wasn't particularly well-liked by his uncle, the emperor Franz Joseph \u2014 now that is a mustache! But even so, the assassination led Austria to issue an ultimatum to Serbia, whereupon Serbia accepted some, but not all, of Austria's demands, leading Austria to declare war against Serbia. And then Russia, due to its alliance with the Serbs, mobilized its army. Germany, because it had an alliance with Austria, told Russia to stop mobilizing, which Russia failed to do, so then Germany mobilized its own army, declared war on Russia, cemented an alliance with the Ottomans, and then declared war on France, because, you know, France.(Laughter)And it's not just physics and world history that people are choosing to learn through YouTube. Here's a video about abstract mathematics.(Video) So you're me, and you're in math class yet again, because they make you go every single day. And you're learning about, I don't know, the sums of infinite series. That's a high school topic, right? Which is odd, because it's a cool topic, but they somehow manage to ruin it anyway. So I guess that's why they allow infinite series in the curriculum. So, in a quite understandable need for distraction, you're doodling and thinking more about what the plural of \"series\" should be than about the topic at hand: \"serieses,\" \"seriese,\" \"seriesen,\" and \"serii?\" Or is it that the singular should be changed: one \"serie,\" or \"serum,\" just like the singular of \"sheep\" should be \"shoop.\" But the whole concept of things like 1/2 + 1/4 + 1/8 + 1/16 and so on approaches one, is useful if, say, you want to draw a line of elephants, each holding the tail of the next one: normal elephant, young elephant, baby elephant, dog-sized elephant, puppy-sized elephant, all the way down to Mr. Tusks and beyond. Which is at least a tiny bit awesome, because you can get an infinite number of elephants in a line, and still have it fit across a single notebook page.JG: And lastly, here's Destin, from \"Smarter Every Day,\" talking about the conservation of angular momentum, and, since it's YouTube, cats:(Video) Hey, it's me, Destin. Welcome back to \"Smarter Every Day.\" So you've probably observed that cats almost always land on their feet. Today's question is: why? Like most simple questions, there's a very complex answer. For instance, let me reword this question: How does a cat go from feet-up to feet-down in a falling reference frame, without violating the conservation of angular momentum?(Laughter)JG: So, here's something all four of these videos have in common: They all have more than half a million views on YouTube. And those are people watching not in classrooms, but because they are part of the communities of learning that are being set up by these channels. And I said earlier that YouTube is like a classroom to me, and in many ways it is, because here is the instructor \u2014 it's like the old-fashioned classroom: here's the instructor, and then beneath the instructor are the students, and they're all having a conversation. And I know that YouTube comments have a very bad reputation in the world of the Internet, but in fact, if you go on comments for these channels, what you'll find is people engaging the subject matter, asking difficult, complicated questions that are about the subject matter, and then other people answering those questions. And because the YouTube page is set up so that the page in which I'm talking to you is on the exact \u2014 the place where I'm talking to you is on the exact same page as your comments, you are participating in a live and real and active way in the conversation. And because I'm in comments usually, I get to participate with you. And you find this whether it's world history, or mathematics, or science, or whatever it is.You also see young people using the tools and the sort of genres of the Internet in order to create places for intellectual engagement, instead of the ironic detachment that maybe most of us associate with memes and other Internet conventions \u2014 you know, \"Got bored. Invented calculus.\" Or, here's Honey Boo Boo criticizing industrial capitalism:[\"Liberal capitalism is not at all the Good of humanity. Quite the contrary; it is the vehicle of savage, destructive nihilism.\"]In case you can't see what she says ... yeah.I really believe that these spaces, these communities, have become for a new generation of learners, the kind of communities, the kind of cartographic communities that I had when I was in high school, and then again when I was in college. And as an adult, re-finding these communities has re-introduced me to a community of learners, and has encouraged me to continue to be a learner even in my adulthood, so that I no longer feel like learning is something reserved for the young. Vi Hart and \"Minute Physics\" introduced me to all kinds of things that I didn't know before. And I know that we all hearken back to the days of the Parisian salon in the Enlightenment, or to the Algonquin Round Table, and wish, \"Oh, I wish I could have been a part of that, I wish I could have laughed at Dorothy Parker's jokes.\" But I'm here to tell you that these places exist, they still exist. They exist in corners of the Internet, where old men fear to tread.(Laughter)And I truly, truly believe that when we invented Agloe, New York, in the 1960s, when we made Agloe real, we were just getting started.Thank you.(Applause)", "id": 2305, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:13.148 --> 00:00:14.809\nThis is a map of New York State\n\n00:00:14.833 --> 00:00:18.351\nthat was made in 1937\nby the General Drafting Company.\n\n00:00:18.375 --> 00:00:21.872\nIt's an extremely famous map\namong cartography nerds,\n\n00:00:21.896 --> 00:00:24.617\nbecause down here at the bottom\nof the Catskill Mountains,\n\n00:00:24.641 --> 00:00:26.520\nthere is a little town called Roscoe --\n\n00:00:26.544 --> 00:00:29.242\nactually, this will go easier\nif I just put it up here --\n\n00:00:29.266 --> 00:00:32.796\nThere's Roscoe, and then right\nabove Roscoe is Rockland, New York,\n\n00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:36.633\nand then right above that\nis the tiny town of Agloe, New York.\n\n00:00:36.657 --> 00:00:39.716\nAgloe, New York, is very famous\nto cartographers,\n\n00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:42.016\nbecause it's a paper town.\n\n00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:44.262\nIt's also known as a copyright trap.\n\n00:00:44.286 --> 00:00:47.640\nMapmakers -- because my map of New York\nand your map of New York\n\n00:00:47.664 --> 00:00:51.330\nare going to look very similar,\non account of the shape of New York --\n\n00:00:51.354 --> 00:00:56.127\noften, mapmakers will insert\nfake places onto their maps,\n\n00:00:56.151 --> 00:00:57.913\nin order to protect their copyright.\n\n00:00:57.937 --> 00:01:00.825\nBecause then, if my fake place\nshows up on your map,\n\n00:01:00.849 --> 00:01:04.504\nI can be well and truly sure\nthat you have robbed me.\n\n00:01:04.528 --> 00:01:09.169\nAgloe is a scrabblization of the initials\nof the two guys who made this map,\n\n00:01:09.193 --> 00:01:12.114\nErnest Alpers and Otto [G.] Lindberg,\n\n00:01:12.138 --> 00:01:15.414\nand they released this map in 1937.\n\n00:01:15.438 --> 00:01:18.757\nDecades later, Rand McNally releases a map\n\n00:01:18.781 --> 00:01:22.805\nwith Agloe, New York, on it,\nat the same exact intersection\n\n00:01:22.829 --> 00:01:25.097\nof two dirt roads\nin the middle of nowhere.\n\n00:01:26.163 --> 00:01:29.424\nWell, you can imagine the delight\nover at General Drafting.\n\n00:01:29.448 --> 00:01:32.660\nThey immediately call\nRand McNally, and they say,\n\n00:01:32.684 --> 00:01:36.278\n\"We've caught you!\nWe made Agloe, New York, up.\n\n00:01:36.302 --> 00:01:38.356\nIt is a fake place.

--> 00:01:51.118\nBecause people kept going\nto that intersection of two dirt roads --\n\n00:01:51.142 --> 00:01:52.166\n(Laughter)\n\n00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:56.686\nin the middle of nowhere,

completely\nirresistible metaphor to a novelist,\n\n00:02:12.056 --> 00:02:16.667\nbecause we would all like to believe\nthat the stuff that we write down on paper\n\n00:02:16.691 --> 00:02:19.483\ncan change the actual world\nin which we're actually living,\n\n00:02:19.507 --> 00:02:21.896\nwhich is why my third book\nis called \"Paper Towns\".\n\n00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:26.459\nBut what interests me ultimately more\nthan the medium in which this happened,\n\n00:02:26.483 --> 00:02:28.864\nis the phenomenon itself.\n\n00:02:29.479 --> 00:02:33.556\nIt's easy enough to say that the world\nshapes our maps of the world, right?\n\n00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:38.007\nLike the overall shape of the world\nis obviously going to affect our maps.\n\n00:02:38.461 -->

00:03:20.703\nI believe that what we map\nchanges the life we lead.\n\n00:03:20.727 --> 00:03:25.141\nAnd I don't mean that in some, like,\nsecret-y Oprah's Angels network, like,\n\n00:03:25.165 --> 00:03:28.135\nyou-can-think-your-way-\nout-of-cancer sense.\n\n00:03:28.159 --> 00:03:34.692\nBut I do believe that while maps don't\nshow you where you will go in your life,\n\n00:03:34.716 --> 00:03:36.707\nthey show you where you might go.\n\n00:03:36.731 --> 00:03:41.204\nYou very rarely go to a place\nthat isn't on your personal map.\n\n00:03:41.811 --> 00:03:44.926\nSo I was a really terrible student\nwhen I was a kid.\n\n00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:47.622\nMy GPA was consistently in the low 2s.\n\n00:03:48.493 --> 00:03:51.254\nAnd I think the reason that I was\nsuch a terrible student\n\n00:03:51.278 --> 00:03:54.433\nis that I felt like education\nwas just a series of hurdles\n\n00:03:54.457 --> 00:03:56.614\nthat had been erected before me,\n\n00:03:56.638 --> 00:04:00.265\nand I had to jump over\nin order to achieve adulthood.\n\n00:04:00.289 --> 00:04:02.773\nAnd I didn't really want\nto jump over these hurdles,\n\n00:04:02.797 --> 00:04:05.731\nbecause they seemed completely\narbitrary, so I often wouldn't,\n\n00:04:05.755 --> 00:04:07.832\nand then people would\nthreaten me, you know,\n\n00:04:07.856 --> 00:04:10.785\nthey'd threaten me with this\n\"going on [my] permanent record,\"\n\n00:04:10.809 --> 00:04:13.018\nor \"You'll never get a good job.\"\n\n00:04:13.042 --> 00:04:14.521\nI didn't want a good job!\n\n00:04:14.961 --> 00:04:17.557\nAs far as I could tell at eleven\nor twelve years old,\n\n00:04:17.581 --> 00:04:20.733\nlike, people with good jobs woke up\nvery early in the morning,\n\n00:04:20.757 --> 00:04:22.762\n(Laughter)\n\n00:04:22.786 --> 00:04:27.358\nand the men who had good jobs,\none of the first things they did\n\n00:04:27.382 --> 00:04:31.305\nwas tie a strangulation item\nof clothing around their necks.\n\n00:04:31.882 --> 00:04:33.930\nThey literally put nooses on themselves,\n\n00:04:33.954 --> 00:04:36.680\nand then they went off to their jobs,\nwhatever they were.\n\n00:04:37.413 --> 00:04:39.443\nThat's not a recipe for a happy life.\n\n00:04:39.876 --> 00:04:43.795\nThese people -- in my, symbol-obsessed,\ntwelve year-old imagination --\n\n00:04:43.819 --> 00:04:46.378\nthese people who are strangling themselves\n\n00:04:46.402 --> 00:04:48.758\nas one of the first things\nthey do each morning,\n\n00:04:48.782 --> 00:04:50.542\nthey can't possibly be happy.\n\n00:04:50.566 --> 00:04:52.978\nWhy would I want to jump\nover all of these hurdles\n\n00:04:53.002 --> 00:04:55.002\nand have that be the end?\n\n00:04:55.026 --> 00:04:56.193\nThat's a terrible end!\n\n00:04:57.412 --> 00:05:00.590\nAnd then, when I was in tenth grade,\nI went to this school,\n\n00:05:00.614 --> 00:05:03.376\nIndian Springs School,\na small boarding school,\n\n00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:05.210\noutside of Birmingham, Alabama.\n\n00:05:05.234 --> 00:05:08.749\nAnd all at once I became a learner.\n\n00:05:08.773 --> 00:05:10.969\nAnd I became a learner,\nbecause I found myself\n\n00:05:10.993 --> 00:05:13.017\nin a community of learners.\n\n00:05:13.041 --> 00:05:14.804\nI found myself surrounded by people\n\n00:05:14.828 --> 00:05:18.058\nwho celebrated intellectualism\nand engagement,\n\n00:05:18.082 --> 00:05:22.255\nand who thought that my ironic\noh-so-cool disengagement\n\n00:05:22.279 --> 00:05:24.133\nwasn't clever, or funny,\n\n00:05:24.157 --> 00:05:27.919\nbut, like, it was a simple\nand unspectacular response\n\n00:05:27.943 --> 00:05:30.217\nto very complicated\nand compelling problems.\n\n00:05:30.650 --> 00:05:33.143\nAnd so I started to learn,\nbecause learning was cool.\n\n00:05:33.167 --> 00:05:36.470\nI learned that some infinite sets\nare bigger than other infinite sets,\n\n00:05:36.494 --> 00:05:40.588\nand I learned that iambic pentameter is\nand why it sounds so good to human ears.\n\n00:05:40.612 --> 00:05:44.054\nI learned that the Civil War\nwas a nationalizing conflict,\n\n00:05:44.078 --> 00:05:45.245\nI learned some physics,\n\n00:05:45.269 --> 00:05:48.425\nI learned that correlation shouldn't be\nconfused with causation --\n\n00:05:48.449 --> 00:05:50.242\nall of these things, by the way,\n\n00:05:50.266 --> 00:05:54.518\nenriched my life\non a literally daily basis.\n\n00:05:54.542 --> 00:05:58.128\nAnd it's true that I don't use\nmost of them for my \"job,\"\n\n00:05:58.152 --> 00:06:00.066\nbut that's not what it's about for me.\n\n00:06:00.090 --> 00:06:02.041\nIt's about cartography.\n\n00:06:02.065 --> 00:06:04.326\nWhat is the process of cartography?\n\n00:06:04.350 --> 00:06:07.511\nIt's, you know, sailing\nupon some land, and thinking,\n\n00:06:07.535 --> 00:06:09.636\n\"I think I'll draw that bit of land,\"\n\n00:06:09.660 --> 00:06:12.983\nand then wondering, \"Maybe there's\nsome more land to draw.\"\n\n00:06:13.007 --> 00:06:15.214\nAnd that's when learning\nreally began for me.\n\n00:06:15.238 --> 00:06:17.874\nIt's true that I had teachers\nthat didn't give up on me,\n\n00:06:17.898 --> 00:06:20.216\nand I was very fortunate\nto have those teachers,\n\n00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:24.414\nbecause I often gave them cause to think\nthere was no reason to invest in me.\n\n00:06:24.882 --> 00:06:27.988\nBut a lot of the learning\nthat I did in high school\n\n00:06:28.012 --> 00:06:31.191\nwasn't about what happened\ninside the classroom,\n\n00:06:31.215 --> 00:06:33.673\nit was about what happened\noutside of the classroom.\n\n00:06:33.697 --> 00:06:35.054\nFor instance, I can tell you\n\n00:06:35.078 --> 00:06:37.911\nthat \"There's a certain Slant of light,\nWinter Afternoons --\n\n00:06:37.935 --> 00:06:40.388\nThat oppresses, like the Heft\nOf Cathedral Tunes --\"\n\n00:06:40.412 --> 00:06:43.728\nnot because I memorized\nEmily Dickinson in school\n\n00:06:43.752 --> 00:06:45.028\nwhen I was in high school,\n\n00:06:45.052 --> 00:06:47.647\nbut because there was a girl\nwhen I was in high school,\n\n00:06:47.671 --> 00:06:50.158\nand her name was Amanda,\nand I had a crush on her,\n\n00:06:50.182 --> 00:06:52.556\nand she liked Emily Dickinson poetry.\n\n00:06:52.580 --> 00:06:55.264\nThe reason I can tell you\nwhat opportunity cost is,\n\n00:06:55.288 --> 00:06:58.940\nis because one day when I was playing\nSuper Mario Kart on my couch,\n\n00:06:58.964 --> 00:07:00.836\nmy friend Emmet walked in, and he said,\n\n00:07:00.860 --> 00:07:03.218\n\"How long have you been playing\nSuper Mario Kart?\"\n\n00:07:03.242 --> 00:07:06.712\nAnd I said, \"I don't know,\nlike, six hours?\" and he said,\n\n00:07:06.736 --> 00:07:10.104\n\"Do you realize that if you'd worked\nat Baskin-Robbins those six hours,\n\n00:07:10.128 --> 00:07:12.386\nyou could have made 30 dollars,\nso in some ways,\n\n00:07:12.410 --> 00:07:15.330\nyou just paid thirty dollars\nto play Super Mario Kart.\"\n\n00:07:15.354 --> 00:07:17.612\nAnd I was, like, \"I'll take that deal.\"\n\n00:07:17.636 --> 00:07:19.985\n(Laughter)\n\n00:07:20.009 --> 00:07:23.934\nBut I learned what opportunity cost is.\n\n00:07:25.037 --> 00:07:28.719\nAnd along the way, the map\nof my life got better.\n\n00:07:28.743 --> 00:07:31.600\nIt got bigger; it contained more places.\n\n00:07:31.624 --> 00:07:33.589\nThere were more things that might happen,\n\n00:07:33.613 --> 00:07:35.572\nmore futures I might have.\n\n00:07:36.620 --> 00:07:39.907\nIt wasn't a formal, organized\nlearning process,\n\n00:07:39.931 --> 00:07:41.662\nand I'm happy to admit that.\n\n00:07:41.686 --> 00:07:44.818\nIt was spotty, it was inconsistent,\nthere was a lot I didn't know.\n\n00:07:44.842 --> 00:07:47.136\nI might know, you know, Cantor's idea\n\n00:07:47.160 --> 00:07:49.993\nthat some infinite sets are larger\nthan other infinite sets,\n\n00:07:50.017 --> 00:07:52.914\nbut I didn't really understand\nthe calculus behind that idea.\n\n00:07:52.938 --> 00:07:54.953\nI might know the idea of opportunity cost,\n\n00:07:54.977 --> 00:07:57.287\nbut I didn't know the law\nof diminishing returns.\n\n00:07:57.311 --> 00:08:00.284\nBut the great thing about imagining\nlearning as cartography,\n\n00:08:00.308 --> 00:08:02.396\ninstead of imagining it\nas arbitrary hurdles\n\n00:08:02.420 --> 00:08:03.778\nthat you have to jump over,\n\n00:08:03.802 --> 00:08:07.274\nis that you see a bit of coastline,\nand that makes you want to see more.\n\n00:08:07.298 --> 00:08:09.735\nAnd so now I do know\nat least some of the calculus\n\n00:08:09.759 --> 00:08:11.491\nthat underlies all of that stuff.\n\n00:08:11.515 --> 00:08:13.285\nSo, I had one learning community\n\n00:08:13.309 --> 00:08:15.923\nin high school, then I went\nto another for college,\n\n00:08:15.947 --> 00:08:17.247\nand then I went to another,\n\n00:08:17.271 --> 00:08:19.867\nwhen I started working\nat a magazine called \"Booklist,\"\n\n00:08:19.891 --> 00:08:23.244\nwhere I was an assistant, surrounded\nby astonishingly well-read people.\n\n00:08:23.268 --> 00:08:24.794\nAnd then I wrote a book.\n\n00:08:24.818 --> 00:08:27.018\nAnd like all authors dream of doing,\n\n00:08:27.042 --> 00:08:28.971\nI promptly quit my job.\n\n00:08:28.995 --> 00:08:30.584\n(Laughter)\n\n00:08:30.608 --> 00:08:32.584\nAnd for the first time since high school,\n\n00:08:32.608 --> 00:08:37.211\nI found myself without a learning\ncommunity, and it was miserable.\n\n00:08:37.235 --> 00:08:38.669\nI hated it.\n\n00:08:38.693 --> 00:08:42.067\nI read many, many books\nduring this two-year period.\n\n00:08:42.091 --> 00:08:43.854\nI read books about Stalin,\n\n00:08:43.878 --> 00:08:47.369\nand books about how the Uzbek people\ncame to identify as Muslims,\n\n00:08:47.393 --> 00:08:49.743\nand I read books about\nhow to make atomic bombs,\n\n00:08:49.767 --> 00:08:52.916\nbut it just felt like I was\ncreating my own hurdles,\n\n00:08:52.940 --> 00:08:56.296\nand then jumping over them myself,\ninstead of feeling the excitement\n\n00:08:56.320 --> 00:08:59.969\nof being part of a community of learners,\na community of people\n\n00:08:59.993 --> 00:09:02.976\nwho are engaged together\nin the cartographic enterprise\n\n00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:06.556\nof trying to better understand\nand map the world around us.\n\n00:09:06.937 --> 00:09:10.026\nAnd then, in 2006, I met that guy.\n\n00:09:10.050 --> 00:09:11.201\nHis name is Ze Frank.\n\n00:09:11.225 --> 00:09:13.862\nI didn't actually meet him,\njust on the Internet.\n\n00:09:14.413 --> 00:09:19.416\nZe Frank was running, at the time,\na show called \"The Show with Ze Frank,\"\n\n00:09:19.440 --> 00:09:20.914\nand I discovered the show,\n\n00:09:20.938 --> 00:09:24.172\nand that was my way back\ninto being a community learner again.\n\n00:09:24.196 --> 00:09:26.351\nHere's Ze talking about Las Vegas:\n\n00:09:27.781 --> 00:09:31.300\n(Video) Ze Frank: Las Vegas was built\nin the middle of a huge, hot desert.\n\n00:09:31.324 --> 00:09:34.020\nAlmost everything here was brought\nfrom somewhere else --\n\n00:09:34.044 --> 00:09:36.220\nthe sort of rocks, the trees,\nthe waterfalls.\n\n00:09:36.244 --> 00:09:39.253\nThese fish are almost as out of place\nas my pig that flew.\n\n00:09:39.277 --> 00:09:42.143\nContrasted to the scorching desert\nthat surrounds this place,\n\n00:09:42.167 --> 00:09:43.321\nso are these people.\n\n00:09:43.345 --> 00:09:47.276\nThings from all over the world have been\nrebuilt here, away from their histories,\n\n00:09:47.300 --> 00:09:50.048\nand away from the people\nthat experience them differently.\n\n00:09:50.072 --> 00:09:53.252\nSometimes improvements were made --\neven the Sphinx got a nose job.\n\n00:09:53.276 --> 00:09:56.167\nHere, there's no reason to feel\nlike you're missing anything.\n\n00:09:56.191 --> 00:09:59.161\nThis New York means the same to me\nas it does to everyone else.\n\n00:09:59.185 --> 00:10:02.742\nEverything is out of context, and that\nmeans context allows for everything:\n\n00:10:02.766 --> 00:10:04.696\nSelf Parking, Events Center, Shark Reef.\n\n00:10:04.720 --> 00:10:08.318\nThis fabrication of place could be one\nof the world's greatest achievements,\n\n00:10:08.342 --> 00:10:10.363\nbecause no one belongs here;\neveryone does.\n\n00:10:10.387 --> 00:10:13.411\nAs I walked around this morning,\nI noticed most of the buildings\n\n00:10:13.435 --> 00:10:16.175\nwere huge mirrors reflecting\nthe sun back into the desert.\n\n00:10:16.199 --> 00:10:17.360\nBut unlike most mirrors,\n\n00:10:17.384 --> 00:10:20.759\nwhich present you with an outside view\nof yourself embedded in a place,\n\n00:10:20.783 --> 00:10:22.228\nthese mirrors come back empty.\n\n00:10:22.252 --> 00:10:24.431\nJohn Green: Makes me\nnostalgic for the days\n\n00:10:24.455 --> 00:10:26.637\nwhen you could see\nthe pixels in online video.\n\n00:10:26.661 --> 00:10:27.668\n(Laughter)\n\n00:10:27.692 --> 00:10:31.778\nZe isn't just a great public intellectual,\nhe's also a brilliant community builder,\n\n00:10:31.802 --> 00:10:34.663\nand the community of people\nthat built up around these videos\n\n00:10:34.687 --> 00:10:36.699\nwas in many ways a community of learners.\n\n00:10:36.723 --> 00:10:40.247\nSo we played Ze Frank at chess\ncollaboratively, and we beat him.\n\n00:10:40.271 --> 00:10:44.684\nWe organized ourselves to take a young man\non a road trip across the United States.\n\n00:10:44.708 --> 00:10:46.659\nWe turned the Earth into a sandwich,\n\n00:10:46.683 --> 00:10:50.392\nby having one person hold a piece of bread\nat one point on the Earth,\n\n00:10:50.416 --> 00:10:52.545\nand on the exact opposite\npoint of the Earth,\n\n00:10:52.569 --> 00:10:55.081\nhave another person\nholding a piece of bread.\n\n00:10:55.551 --> 00:11:01.559\nI realize that these are silly ideas,\nbut they are also \"learny\" ideas,\n\n00:11:01.583 --> 00:11:03.505\nand that was what was so exciting to me,\n\n00:11:03.529 --> 00:11:07.119\nand if you go online, you can find\ncommunities like this all over the place.\n\n00:11:07.143 --> 00:11:09.024\nFollow the calculus tag on Tumblr,\n\n00:11:09.048 --> 00:11:11.699\nand yes, you will see people\ncomplaining about calculus,\n\n00:11:11.723 --> 00:11:14.393\nbut you'll also see people\nre-blogging those complaints,\n\n00:11:14.417 --> 00:11:17.601\nmaking the argument that calculus\nis interesting and beautiful,\n\n00:11:17.625 --> 00:11:21.578\nand here's a way in to thinking about\nthe problem that you find unsolvable.\n\n00:11:21.602 --> 00:11:24.198\nYou can go to places like Reddit,\nand find sub-Reddits,\n\n00:11:24.222 --> 00:11:26.840\nlike \"Ask a Historian\" or \"Ask Science,\"\n\n00:11:26.864 --> 00:11:30.095\nwhere you can ask people\nwho are in these fields\n\n00:11:30.119 --> 00:11:31.587\na wide range of questions,\n\n00:11:31.611 --> 00:11:33.952\nfrom very serious ones to very silly ones.\n\n00:11:33.976 --> 00:11:36.908\nBut to me, the most interesting\ncommunities of learners\n\n00:11:36.932 --> 00:11:39.795\nthat are growing up on the Internet\nright now are on YouTube,\n\n00:11:39.819 --> 00:11:41.415\nand admittedly, I am biased.\n\n00:11:41.439 --> 00:11:45.973\nBut I think in a lot of ways,\nthe YouTube page resembles a classroom.\n\n00:11:45.997 --> 00:11:47.821\nLook for instance at \"Minute Physics,\"\n\n00:11:47.845 --> 00:11:50.638\na guy who's teaching\nthe world about physics:\n\n00:11:50.662 --> 00:11:52.163\n(Video) Let's cut to the chase.\n\n00:11:52.187 --> 00:11:55.545\nAs of July 4, 2012, the Higgs boson\nis the last fundamental piece\n\n00:11:55.569 --> 00:11:59.049\nof the standard model of particle physics\nto be discovered experimentally.\n\n00:11:59.073 --> 00:12:01.127\nBut, you might ask,\nwhy was the Higgs boson\n\n00:12:01.151 --> 00:12:02.637\nincluded in the standard model,\n\n00:12:02.661 --> 00:12:05.931\nalongside well-known particles\nlike electrons and photons and quarks,\n\n00:12:05.955 --> 00:12:08.475\nif it hadn't been discovered\nback then in the 1970s?\n\n00:12:08.499 --> 00:12:10.499\nGood question. There are two main reasons.\n\n00:12:10.523 --> 00:12:13.782\nFirst, just like the electron\nis an excitation in the electron field,\n\n00:12:13.806 --> 00:12:16.600\nthe Higgs boson is simply a particle\nwhich is an excitation\n\n00:12:16.624 --> 00:12:18.607\nof the everywhere-permeating Higgs field.\n\n00:12:18.631 --> 00:12:20.875\nThe Higgs field in turn\nplays an integral role\n\n00:12:20.899 --> 00:12:22.828\nin our model for the weak nuclear force.\n\n00:12:22.852 --> 00:12:26.012\nIn particular, the Higgs field\nhelps explain why it's so weak.\n\n00:12:26.036 --> 00:12:28.100\nWe'll talk more about this\nin a later video,\n\n00:12:28.124 --> 00:12:31.958\nbut even though weak nuclear theory was\nconfirmed in the 1980s, in the equations,\n\n00:12:31.982 --> 00:12:35.694\nthe Higgs field is so inextricably jumbled\nwith the weak force, that until now\n\n00:12:35.718 --> 00:12:38.885\nwe've been unable to confirm\nits actual and independent existence.\n\n00:12:38.909 --> 00:12:40.684\nJG: Or here's a video that I made\n\n00:12:40.708 --> 00:12:43.917\nas part of my show \"Crash Course,\"\ntalking about World War I:\n\n00:12:43.941 --> 00:12:47.312\n(Video) The immediate cause was\nof course the assassination in Sarajevo\n\n00:12:47.336 --> 00:12:49.347\nof the Austrian Archduke Franz Ferdinand,\n\n00:12:49.371 --> 00:12:53.797\non June 28, 1914, by a Bosnian-Serb\nnationalist named Gavrilo Princip.\n\n00:12:53.821 --> 00:12:55.263\nQuick aside: It's worth noting\n\n00:12:55.287 --> 00:12:57.779\nthat the first big war\nof the twentieth century began\n\n00:12:57.803 --> 00:12:59.024\nwith an act of terrorism.\n\n00:12:59.048 --> 00:13:01.379\nSo Franz Ferdinand\nwasn't particularly well-liked\n\n00:13:01.403 --> 00:13:05.037\nby his uncle, the emperor Franz Joseph --\nnow that is a mustache!\n\n00:13:05.061 --> 00:13:08.836\nBut even so, the assassination led Austria\nto issue an ultimatum to Serbia,\n\n00:13:08.860 --> 00:13:12.072\nwhereupon Serbia accepted some,\nbut not all, of Austria's demands,\n\n00:13:12.096 --> 00:13:14.656\nleading Austria to declare\nwar against Serbia.\n\n00:13:14.680 --> 00:13:18.061\nAnd then Russia, due to its alliance\nwith the Serbs, mobilized its army.\n\n00:13:18.085 --> 00:13:20.395\nGermany, because it had\nan alliance with Austria,\n\n00:13:20.419 --> 00:13:21.916\ntold Russia to stop mobilizing,\n\n00:13:21.940 --> 00:13:25.199\nwhich Russia failed to do, so then Germany\nmobilized its own army,\n\n00:13:25.223 --> 00:13:28.292\ndeclared war on Russia,\ncemented an alliance with the Ottomans,\n\n00:13:28.316 --> 00:13:31.895\nand then declared war on France,\nbecause, you know, France.\n\n00:13:31.919 --> 00:13:35.372\n(Laughter)\n\n00:13:35.396 --> 00:13:37.640\nAnd it's not just physics\nand world history\n\n00:13:37.664 --> 00:13:40.796\nthat people are choosing\nto learn through YouTube.\n\n00:13:40.820 --> 00:13:43.198\nHere's a video about abstract mathematics.\n\n00:13:45.872 --> 00:13:48.556\n(Video) So you're me, and you're\nin math class yet again,\n\n00:13:48.580 --> 00:13:50.582\nbecause they make you go every single day.\n\n00:13:50.606 --> 00:13:53.873\nAnd you're learning about, I don't know,\nthe sums of infinite series.\n\n00:13:53.897 --> 00:13:55.523\nThat's a high school topic, right?\n\n00:13:55.547 --> 00:13:59.463\nWhich is odd, because it's a cool topic,\nbut they somehow manage to ruin it anyway.\n\n00:13:59.487 --> 00:14:02.645\nSo I guess that's why they allow\ninfinite series in the curriculum.\n\n00:14:02.669 --> 00:14:05.821\nSo, in a quite understandable need\nfor distraction, you're doodling\n\n00:14:05.845 --> 00:14:08.777\nand thinking more about what\nthe plural of \"series\" should be\n\n00:14:08.801 --> 00:14:12.443\nthan about the topic at hand: \"serieses,\"\n\"seriese,\" \"seriesen,\" and \"serii?\"\n\n00:14:12.467 --> 00:14:15.766\nOr is it that the singular should be\nchanged: one \"serie,\" or \"serum,\"\n\n00:14:15.790 --> 00:14:18.234\njust like the singular of \"sheep\"\nshould be \"shoop.\"\n\n00:14:18.258 --> 00:14:19.751\nBut the whole concept of things\n\n00:14:19.775 --> 00:14:23.236\nlike 1/2 + 1/4 + 1/8 + 1/16 and so on\napproaches one, is useful if, say,\n\n00:14:23.260 --> 00:14:25.023\nyou want to draw a line of elephants,\n\n00:14:25.047 --> 00:14:26.863\neach holding the tail of the next one:\n\n00:14:26.887 --> 00:14:30.055\nnormal elephant, young elephant,\nbaby elephant, dog-sized elephant,\n\n00:14:30.079 --> 00:14:33.050\npuppy-sized elephant, all the way\ndown to Mr. Tusks and beyond.\n\n00:14:33.074 --> 00:14:34.855\nWhich is at least a tiny bit awesome,\n\n00:14:34.879 --> 00:14:37.826\nbecause you can get an infinite number\nof elephants in a line,\n\n00:14:37.850 --> 00:14:40.303\nand still have it fit across\na single notebook page.\n\n00:14:40.327 --> 00:14:42.949\nJG: And lastly, here's Destin,\nfrom \"Smarter Every Day,\"\n\n00:14:42.973 --> 00:14:45.382\ntalking about the conservation\nof angular momentum,\n\n00:14:45.406 --> 00:14:46.883\nand, since it's YouTube, cats:\n\n00:14:46.907 --> 00:14:50.018\n(Video) Hey, it's me, Destin.\nWelcome back to \"Smarter Every Day.\"\n\n00:14:50.042 --> 00:14:53.384\nSo you've probably observed that cats\nalmost always land on their feet.\n\n00:14:53.408 --> 00:14:55.368\nToday's question is: why?\n\n00:14:55.392 --> 00:14:58.148\nLike most simple questions,\nthere's a very complex answer.\n\n00:14:58.172 --> 00:15:00.182\nFor instance, let me reword this question:\n\n00:15:00.206 --> 00:15:05.401\nHow does a cat go from feet-up\nto feet-down in a falling reference frame,\n\n00:15:05.425 --> 00:15:08.390\nwithout violating the conservation\nof angular momentum?\n\n00:15:08.414 --> 00:15:09.425\n(Laughter)\n\n00:15:09.449 --> 00:15:12.926\nJG: So, here's something all four\nof these videos have in common:\n\n00:15:13.355 --> 00:15:16.474\nThey all have more than half\na million views on YouTube.\n\n00:15:16.498 --> 00:15:19.567\nAnd those are people watching\nnot in classrooms,\n\n00:15:19.591 --> 00:15:23.232\nbut because they are part\nof the communities of learning\n\n00:15:23.256 --> 00:15:25.271\nthat are being set up by these channels.\n\n00:15:25.644 --> 00:15:28.375\nAnd I said earlier that YouTube\nis like a classroom to me,\n\n00:15:28.399 --> 00:15:31.082\nand in many ways it is,\nbecause here is the instructor --\n\n00:15:31.106 --> 00:15:34.124\nit's like the old-fashioned classroom:\nhere's the instructor,\n\n00:15:34.148 --> 00:15:36.471\nand then beneath the instructor\nare the students,\n\n00:15:36.495 --> 00:15:38.566\nand they're all having a conversation.\n\n00:15:38.590 --> 00:15:42.619\nAnd I know that YouTube comments\nhave a very bad reputation\n\n00:15:42.643 --> 00:15:44.038\nin the world of the Internet,\n\n00:15:44.062 --> 00:15:47.133\nbut in fact, if you go on comments\nfor these channels,\n\n00:15:47.157 --> 00:15:50.312\nwhat you'll find is people engaging\nthe subject matter,\n\n00:15:50.336 --> 00:15:54.583\nasking difficult, complicated questions\nthat are about the subject matter,\n\n00:15:54.607 --> 00:15:57.345\nand then other people\nanswering those questions.\n\n00:15:57.369 --> 00:16:02.203\nAnd because the YouTube page is set up so\nthat the page in which I'm talking to you\n\n00:16:02.227 --> 00:16:06.070\nis on the exact -- the place where I'm\ntalking to you is on the exact same page\n\n00:16:06.094 --> 00:16:07.252\nas your comments,\n\n00:16:07.276 --> 00:16:12.908\nyou are participating in a live and real\nand active way in the conversation.\n\n00:16:12.932 --> 00:16:16.503\nAnd because I'm in comments usually,\nI get to participate with you.\n\n00:16:16.527 --> 00:16:18.981\nAnd you find this\nwhether it's world history,\n\n00:16:19.005 --> 00:16:22.067\nor mathematics, or science,\nor whatever it is.\n\n00:16:22.091 --> 00:16:27.709\nYou also see young people using the tools\nand the sort of genres of the Internet\n\n00:16:27.733 --> 00:16:30.810\nin order to create places\nfor intellectual engagement,\n\n00:16:30.834 --> 00:16:32.434\ninstead of the ironic detachment\n\n00:16:32.458 --> 00:16:37.155\nthat maybe most of us associate with memes\nand other Internet conventions --\n\n00:16:37.179 --> 00:16:39.703\nyou know, \"Got bored. Invented calculus.\"\n\n00:16:39.727 --> 00:16:43.178\nOr, here's Honey Boo Boo\ncriticizing industrial capitalism:\n\n00:16:43.202 --> 00:16:45.868\n[\"Liberal capitalism is not at all\nthe Good of humanity.\n\n00:16:45.892 --> 00:16:49.451\nQuite the contrary; it is the vehicle\nof savage, destructive nihilism.\"]\n\n00:16:49.475 --> 00:16:51.759\nIn case you can't see\nwhat she says ... yeah.\n\n00:16:52.283 --> 00:16:55.940\nI really believe that these spaces,\n\n00:16:55.964 --> 00:17:00.997\nthese communities, have become\nfor a new generation of learners,\n\n00:17:01.021 --> 00:17:05.386\nthe kind of communities,\nthe kind of cartographic communities\n\n00:17:05.410 --> 00:17:09.953\nthat I had when I was in high school,\nand then again when I was in college.\n\n00:17:09.977 --> 00:17:13.246\nAnd as an adult, re-finding\nthese communities\n\n00:17:13.270 --> 00:17:16.580\nhas re-introduced me\nto a community of learners,\n\n00:17:16.604 --> 00:17:21.502\nand has encouraged me to continue\nto be a learner even in my adulthood,\n\n00:17:21.526 --> 00:17:26.237\nso that I no longer feel like learning\nis something reserved for the young.\n\n00:17:26.261 --> 00:17:28.484\nVi Hart and \"Minute Physics\" introduced me\n\n00:17:28.508 --> 00:17:31.308\nto all kinds of things\nthat I didn't know before.\n\n00:17:31.712 --> 00:17:33.391\nAnd I know that we all hearken back\n\n00:17:33.415 --> 00:17:36.501\nto the days of the Parisian salon\nin the Enlightenment,\n\n00:17:36.525 --> 00:17:38.554\nor to the Algonquin Round Table, and wish,\n\n00:17:38.578 --> 00:17:40.703\n\"Oh, I wish I could have been\na part of that,\n\n00:17:40.727 --> 00:17:43.572\nI wish I could have laughed\nat Dorothy Parker's jokes.\"\n\n00:17:43.596 --> 00:17:48.374\nBut I'm here to tell you that these places\nexist, they still exist.\n\n00:17:48.398 --> 00:17:52.927\nThey exist in corners of the Internet,\nwhere old men fear to tread.\n\n00:17:52.951 --> 00:17:53.954\n(Laughter)\n\n00:17:53.978 --> 00:18:00.803\nAnd I truly, truly believe that when\nwe invented Agloe, New York, in the 1960s,\n\n00:18:00.827 --> 00:18:04.625\nwhen we made Agloe real,\nwe were just getting started.\n\n00:18:05.204 --> 00:18:06.356\nThank you.\n\n00:18:06.380 --> 00:18:08.961\n(Applause)"}, {"title": "Street art with a message of hope and peace", "duration": "339", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/el_seed_street_art_with_a_message_of_hope_and_peace", "transcript": "In 2012, when I painted the minaret of Jara Mosque in my hometown of Gab\u00e9s, in the south of Tunisia, I never thought that graffiti would bring so much attention to a city.At the beginning, I was just looking for a wall in my hometown, and it happened that the minaret was built in '94. And for 18 years, those 57 meters of concrete stayed grey. When I met the imam for the first time, and I told him what I wanted to do, he was like, \"Thank God you finally came,\" and he told me that for years he was waiting for somebody to do something on it. The most amazing thing about this imam is that he didn't ask me anything \u2014 neither a sketch, or what I was going to write.In every work that I create, I write messages with my style of calligraffiti \u2014 a mix of calligraphy and graffiti. I use quotes or poetry. For the minaret, I thought that the most relevant message to be put on a mosque should come from the Quran, so I picked this verse: \"Oh humankind, we have created you from a male and a female, and made you people and tribe, so you may know each other.\" It was a universal call for peace, tolerance, and acceptance coming from the side that we don't usually portray in a good way in the media.I was amazed to see how the local community reacted to the painting, and how it made them proud to see the minaret getting so much attention from international press all around the world. For the imam, it was not just the painting; it was really deeper than that. He hoped that this minaret would become a monument for the city, and attract people to this forgotten place of Tunisia. The universality of the message, the political context of Tunisia at this time, and the fact that I was writing Quran in a graffiti way were not insignificant. It reunited the community.Bringing people, future generations, together through Arabic calligraphy is what I do. Writing messages is the essence of my artwork. What is funny, actually, is that even Arabic-speaking people really need to focus a lot to decipher what I'm writing. You don't need to know the meaning to feel the piece. I think that Arabic script touches your soul before it reaches your eyes. There is a beauty in it that you don't need to translate. Arabic script speaks to anyone, I believe; to you, to you, to you, to anybody, and then when you get the meaning, you feel connected to it. I always make sure to write messages that are relevant to the place where I'm painting, but messages that have a universal dimension, so anybody around the world can connect to it.I was born and raised in France, in Paris, and I started learning how to write and read Arabic when I was 18. Today I only write messages in Arabic. One of the reasons this is so important to me, is because of all the reaction that I've experienced all around the world.In Rio de Janeiro, I translated this Portuguese poem from Gabriela T\u00f4rres Barbosa, who was giving an homage to the poor people of the favela, and then I painted it on the rooftop. The local community were really intrigued by what I was doing, but as soon as I gave them the meaning of the calligraphy, they thanked me, as they felt connected to the piece.In South Africa, in Cape Town, the local community of Philippi offered me the only concrete wall of the slum. It was a school, and I wrote on it a quote from Nelson Mandela, saying, \"[in Arabic],\" which means, \"It seems impossible until it's done.\" Then this guy came to me and said, \"Man, why you don't write in English?\" and I replied to him, \"I would consider your concern legit if you asked me why I didn't write in Zulu.\"In Paris, once, there was this event, and someone gave his wall to be painted. And when he saw I was painting in Arabic, he got so mad \u2014 actually, hysterical \u2014 and he asked for the wall to be erased. I was mad and disappointed. But a week later, the organizer of the event asked me to come back, and he told me that there was a wall right in front of this guy's house. So, this guy \u2014 (Laughter) like, was forced to see it every day. At the beginning, I was going to write, \"[In Arabic],\" which means, \"In your face,\" but \u2014 (Laughter) I decided to be smarter and I wrote, \"[In Arabic],\" which means, \"Open your heart.\"I'm really proud of my culture, and I'm trying to be an ambassador of it through my artwork. And I hope that I can break the stereotypes we all know, with the beauty of Arabic script. Today, I don't write the translation of the message anymore on the wall. I don't want the poetry of the calligraphy to be broken, as it's art and you can appreciate it without knowing the meaning, as you can enjoy any music from other countries. Some people see that as a rejection or a closed door, but for me, it's more an invitation \u2014 to my language, to my culture, and to my art.Thank you.(Applause)", "id": 2304, "subtitle":

00:02:34.785\nThere is a beauty in it\nthat you don't need to translate.\n\n00:02:35.586 --> 00:02:37.864\nArabic script speaks to anyone, I believe;\n\n00:02:37.888 --> 00:02:41.405\nto you, to you, to you, to anybody,\n\n00:02:41.429 --> 00:02:43.389\nand then when you get the meaning,\n\n\n00:02:43.389 --> 00:02:45.393\nyou feel connected to it.\n\n00:02:45.393 --> 00:02:47.740\nI always make sure to write messages\n\n00:02:47.764 --> 00:02:50.135\nthat are relevant to the place\nwhere I'm painting,\n\n00:02:50.159 --> 00:02:53.240\nbut messages that have\na universal dimension,\n\n00:02:53.264 --> 00:02:56.006\nso anybody around the world\ncan connect to it.\n\n00:02:56.657 --> 00:02:58.984\nI was born and raised in France, in Paris,\n\n00:02:59.008 --> 00:03:02.953\nand I started learning how to write\nand read Arabic when I was 18.\n\n00:03:03.518 --> 00:03:07.018\nToday I only write messages in Arabic.\n\n00:03:07.042 --> 00:03:10.239\nOne of the reasons\nthis is so important to me,\n\n00:03:10.263 --> 00:03:14.079\nis because of all the reaction that\nI've experienced all around the world.\n\n00:03:15.658 --> 00:03:19.564\nIn Rio de Janeiro, I translated\nthis Portuguese poem\n\n00:03:19.588 --> 00:03:21.500\nfrom Gabriela T\u00f4rres Barbosa,\n\n00:03:21.524 --> 00:03:24.904\nwho was giving an homage\nto the poor people of the favela,\n\n00:03:24.928 --> 00:03:26.896\nand then I painted it on the rooftop.\n\n00:03:27.325 --> 00:03:30.238\nThe local community were really\nintrigued by what I was doing,\n\n00:03:30.262 --> 00:03:33.855\nbut as soon as I gave them\nthe meaning of the calligraphy,\n\n00:03:33.879 --> 00:03:36.808\nthey thanked me, as they felt\nconnected to the piece.\n\n00:03:38.681 --> 00:03:40.671\nIn South Africa, in Cape Town,\n\n00:03:40.695 --> 00:03:43.744\nthe local community of Philippi\n\n00:03:43.768 --> 00:03:46.815\noffered me the only\nconcrete wall of the slum.\n\n00:03:46.839 --> 00:03:49.212\nIt was a school, and I wrote on it\n\n00:03:49.236 --> 00:03:50.704\na quote from Nelson Mandela,\n\n00:03:50.728 --> 00:03:53.391\nsaying, \"[in Arabic],\"\n\n00:03:53.415 --> 00:03:56.098\nwhich means, \"It seems\nimpossible until it's done.\"\n\n00:03:56.447 --> 00:04:00.032\nThen this guy came to me and said,\n\"Man, why you don't write in English?\"\n\n00:04:00.056 --> 00:04:04.151\nand I replied to him, \"I would consider\nyour concern legit if you asked me\n\n00:04:04.175 --> 00:04:05.759\nwhy I didn't write in Zulu.\"\n\n00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:09.014\nIn Paris, once, there was this event,\n\n00:04:09.038 --> 00:04:12.944\nand someone gave his wall to be painted.\n\n00:04:13.974 --> 00:04:16.331\nAnd when he saw I was painting in Arabic,\n\n00:04:16.355 --> 00:04:20.379\nhe got so mad -- actually, hysterical --\nand he asked for the wall to be erased.\n\n00:04:20.403 --> 00:04:22.370\nI was mad and disappointed.\n\n00:04:22.394 --> 00:04:26.271\nBut a week later, the organizer\nof the event asked me to come back,\n\n00:04:26.295 --> 00:04:30.013\nand he told me that there was a wall\nright in front of this guy's house.\n\n00:04:30.037 --> 00:04:31.189\nSo, this guy --\n\n00:04:31.213 --> 00:04:33.432\n(Laughter)\n\n00:04:33.456 --> 00:04:35.481\nlike, was forced to see it every day.\n\n00:04:35.505 --> 00:04:38.489\nAt the beginning, I was going\nto write, \"[In Arabic],\"\n\n00:04:38.513 --> 00:04:40.504\nwhich means, \"In your face,\" but --\n\n00:04:40.528 --> 00:04:42.871\n(Laughter)\n\n00:04:42.895 --> 00:04:46.554\nI decided to be smarter\nand I wrote, \"[In Arabic],\"\n\n00:04:46.578 --> 00:04:48.212\nwhich means, \"Open your heart.\"\n\n00:04:49.053 --> 00:04:52.129\nI'm really proud of my culture,\n\n00:04:52.153 --> 00:04:57.668\nand I'm trying to be an ambassador\nof it through my artwork.\n\n00:04:57.692 --> 00:05:02.628\nAnd I hope that I can break\nthe stereotypes we all know,\n\n00:05:02.652 --> 00:05:04.426\nwith the beauty of Arabic script.\n\n00:05:05.165 --> 00:05:10.613\nToday, I don't write the translation\nof the message anymore on the wall.\n\n00:05:11.106 --> 00:05:14.783\nI don't want the poetry\nof the calligraphy to be broken,\n\n00:05:14.807 --> 00:05:17.988\nas it's art and you can appreciate it\nwithout knowing the meaning,\n\n00:05:18.012 --> 00:05:21.048\nas you can enjoy any music\nfrom other countries.\n\n00:05:21.588 --> 00:05:25.363\nSome people see that\nas a rejection or a closed door,\n\n00:05:25.387 --> 00:05:27.856\nbut for me, it's more an invitation --\n\n00:05:27.880 --> 00:05:31.159\nto my language,\nto my culture, and to my art.\n\n00:05:31.183 --> 00:05:32.341\nThank you.\n\n00:05:32.365 --> 00:05:35.217\n(Applause)"}, {"title": "What explains the rise of humans?", "duration": "1028", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/yuval_noah_harari_what_explains_the_rise_of_humans", "transcript": "Seventy-thousand years ago, our ancestors were insignificant animals. The most important thing to know about prehistoric humans is that they were unimportant. Their impact on the world was not much greater than that of jellyfish or fireflies or woodpeckers. Today, in contrast, we control this planet. And the question is: How did we come from there to here? How did we turn ourselves from insignificant apes, minding their own business in a corner of Africa, into the rulers of planet Earth?Usually, we look for the difference between us and all the other animals on the individual level. We want to believe \u2014 I want to believe \u2014 that there is something special about me, about my body, about my brain, that makes me so superior to a dog or a pig, or a chimpanzee. But the truth is that, on the individual level, I'm embarrassingly similar to a chimpanzee. And if you take me and a chimpanzee and put us together on some lonely island, and we had to struggle for survival to see who survives better, I would definitely place my bet on the chimpanzee, not on myself. And this is not something wrong with me personally. I guess if they took almost any one of you, and placed you alone with a chimpanzee on some island, the chimpanzee would do much better.The real difference between humans and all other animals is not on the individual level; it's on the collective level. Humans control the planet because they are the only animals that can cooperate both flexibly and in very large numbers. Now, there are other animals \u2014 like the social insects, the bees, the ants \u2014 that can cooperate in large numbers, but they don't do so flexibly. Their cooperation is very rigid. There is basically just one way in which a beehive can function. And if there's a new opportunity or a new danger, the bees cannot reinvent the social system overnight. They cannot, for example, execute the queen and establish a republic of bees, or a communist dictatorship of worker bees.Other animals, like the social mammals \u2014 the wolves, the elephants, the dolphins, the chimpanzees \u2014 they can cooperate much more flexibly, but they do so only in small numbers, because cooperation among chimpanzees is based on intimate knowledge, one of the other. I'm a chimpanzee and you're a chimpanzee, and I want to cooperate with you. I need to know you personally. What kind of chimpanzee are you? Are you a nice chimpanzee? Are you an evil chimpanzee? Are you trustworthy? If I don't know you, how can I cooperate with you?The only animal that can combine the two abilities together and cooperate both flexibly and still do so in very large numbers is us, Homo sapiens. One versus one, or even 10 versus 10, chimpanzees might be better than us. But, if you pit 1,000 humans against 1,000 chimpanzees, the humans will win easily, for the simple reason that a thousand chimpanzees cannot cooperate at all. And if you now try to cram 100,000 chimpanzees into Oxford Street, or into Wembley Stadium, or Tienanmen Square or the Vatican, you will get chaos, complete chaos. Just imagine Wembley Stadium with 100,000 chimpanzees. Complete madness.In contrast, humans normally gather there in tens of thousands, and what we get is not chaos, usually. What we get is extremely sophisticated and effective networks of cooperation. All the huge achievements of humankind throughout history, whether it's building the pyramids or flying to the moon, have been based not on individual abilities, but on this ability to cooperate flexibly in large numbers.Think even about this very talk that I'm giving now: I'm standing here in front of an audience of about 300 or 400 people, most of you are complete strangers to me. Similarly, I don't really know all the people who have organized and worked on this event. I don't know the pilot and the crew members of the plane that brought me over here, yesterday, to London. I don't know the people who invented and manufactured this microphone and these cameras, which are recording what I'm saying. I don't know the people who wrote all the books and articles that I read in preparation for this talk. And I certainly don't know all the people who might be watching this talk over the Internet, somewhere in Buenos Aires or in New Delhi.Nevertheless, even though we don't know each other, we can work together to create this global exchange of ideas. This is something chimpanzees cannot do. They communicate, of course, but you will never catch a chimpanzee traveling to some distant chimpanzee band to give them a talk about bananas or about elephants, or anything else that might interest chimpanzees. Now cooperation is, of course, not always nice; all the horrible things humans have been doing throughout history \u2014 and we have been doing some very horrible things \u2014 all those things are also based on large-scale cooperation. Prisons are a system of cooperation; slaughterhouses are a system of cooperation; concentration camps are a system of cooperation. Chimpanzees don't have slaughterhouses and prisons and concentration camps.Now suppose I've managed to convince you perhaps that yes, we control the world because we can cooperate flexibly in large numbers. The next question that immediately arises in the mind of an inquisitive listener is: How, exactly, do we do it? What enables us alone, of all the animals, to cooperate in such a way? The answer is our imagination. We can cooperate flexibly with countless numbers of strangers, because we alone, of all the animals on the planet, can create and believe fictions, fictional stories. And as long as everybody believes in the same fiction, everybody obeys and follows the same rules, the same norms, the same values.All other animals use their communication system only to describe reality. A chimpanzee may say, \"Look! There's a lion, let's run away!\" Or, \"Look! There's a banana tree over there! Let's go and get bananas!\" Humans, in contrast, use their language not merely to describe reality, but also to create new realities, fictional realities. A human can say, \"Look, there is a god above the clouds! And if you don't do what I tell you to do, when you die, God will punish you and send you to hell.\" And if you all believe this story that I've invented, then you will follow the same norms and laws and values, and you can cooperate. This is something only humans can do. You can never convince a chimpanzee to give you a banana by promising him, \"... after you die, you'll go to chimpanzee heaven ...\" (Laughter) \"... and you'll receive lots and lots of bananas for your good deeds. So now give me this banana.\" No chimpanzee will ever believe such a story. Only humans believe such stories, which is why we control the world, whereas the chimpanzees are locked up in zoos and research laboratories.Now you may find it acceptable that yes, in the religious field, humans cooperate by believing in the same fictions. Millions of people come together to build a cathedral or a mosque or fight in a crusade or a jihad, because they all believe in the same stories about God and heaven and hell. But what I want to emphasize is that exactly the same mechanism underlies all other forms of mass-scale human cooperation, not only in the religious field.Take, for example, the legal field. Most legal systems today in the world are based on a belief in human rights. But what are human rights? Human rights, just like God and heaven, are just a story that we've invented. They are not an objective reality; they are not some biological effect about homo sapiens. Take a human being, cut him open, look inside, you will find the heart, the kidneys, neurons, hormones, DNA, but you won't find any rights. The only place you find rights are in the stories that we have invented and spread around over the last few centuries. They may be very positive stories, very good stories, but they're still just fictional stories that we've invented.The same is true of the political field. The most important factors in modern politics are states and nations. But what are states and nations? They are not an objective reality. A mountain is an objective reality. You can see it, you can touch it, you can even smell it. But a nation or a state, like Israel or Iran or France or Germany, this is just a story that we've invented and became extremely attached to.The same is true of the economic field. The most important actors today in the global economy are companies and corporations. Many of you today, perhaps, work for a corporation, like Google or Toyota or McDonald's. What exactly are these things? They are what lawyers call legal fictions. They are stories invented and maintained by the powerful wizards we call lawyers. (Laughter) And what do corporations do all day? Mostly, they try to make money. Yet, what is money? Again, money is not an objective reality; it has no objective value. Take this green piece of paper, the dollar bill. Look at it \u2014 it has no value. You cannot eat it, you cannot drink it, you cannot wear it. But then came along these master storytellers \u2014 the big bankers, the finance ministers, the prime ministers \u2014 and they tell us a very convincing story: \"Look, you see this green piece of paper? It is actually worth 10 bananas.\" And if I believe it, and you believe it, and everybody believes it, it actually works. I can take this worthless piece of paper, go to the supermarket, give it to a complete stranger whom I've never met before, and get, in exchange, real bananas which I can actually eat. This is something amazing. You could never do it with chimpanzees. Chimpanzees trade, of course: \"Yes, you give me a coconut, I'll give you a banana.\" That can work. But, you give me a worthless piece of paper and you except me to give you a banana? No way! What do you think I am, a human? (Laughter)Money, in fact, is the most successful story ever invented and told by humans, because it is the only story everybody believes. Not everybody believes in God, not everybody believes in human rights, not everybody believes in nationalism, but everybody believes in money, and in the dollar bill. Take, even, Osama Bin Laden. He hated American politics and American religion and American culture, but he had no objection to American dollars. He was quite fond of them, actually. (Laughter)To conclude, then: We humans control the world because we live in a dual reality. All other animals live in an objective reality. Their reality consists of objective entities, like rivers and trees and lions and elephants. We humans, we also live in an objective reality. In our world, too, there are rivers and trees and lions and elephants. But over the centuries, we have constructed on top of this objective reality a second layer of fictional reality, a reality made of fictional entities, like nations, like gods, like money, like corporations. And what is amazing is that as history unfolded, this fictional reality became more and more powerful so that today, the most powerful forces in the world are these fictional entities. Today, the very survival of rivers and trees and lions and elephants depends on the decisions and wishes of fictional entities, like the United States, like Google, like the World Bank \u2014 entities that exist only in our own imagination.Thank you. (Applause)Bruno Giussani: Yuval, you have a new book out. After Sapiens, you wrote another one, and it's out in Hebrew, but not yet translated into ...Yuval Noah Harari: I'm working on the translation as we speak.BG: In the book, if I understand it correctly, you argue that the amazing breakthroughs that we are experiencing right now not only will potentially make our lives better, but they will create \u2014 and I quote you \u2014 \"... new classes and new class struggles, just as the industrial revolution did.\" Can you elaborate for us?YNH: Yes. In the industrial revolution, we saw the creation of a new class of the urban proletariat. And much of the political and social history of the last 200 years involved what to do with this class, and the new problems and opportunities. Now, we see the creation of a new massive class of useless people. (Laughter) As computers become better and better in more and more fields, there is a distinct possibility that computers will out-perform us in most tasks and will make humans redundant. And then the big political and economic question of the 21st century will be, \"What do we need humans for?\", or at least, \"What do we need so many humans for?\"BG: Do you have an answer in the book?YNH: At present, the best guess we have is to keep them happy with drugs and computer games ... (Laughter) but this doesn't sound like a very appealing future.BG: Ok, so you're basically saying in the book and now, that for all the discussion about the growing evidence of significant economic inequality, we are just kind of at the beginning of the process?YNH: Again, it's not a prophecy; it's seeing all kinds of possibilities before us. One possibility is this creation of a new massive class of useless people. Another possibility is the division of humankind into different biological castes, with the rich being upgraded into virtual gods, and the poor being degraded to this level of useless people.BG: I feel there is another TED talk coming up in a year or two. Thank you, Yuval, for making the trip.YNH: Thanks!

00:03:14.214\nAre you a nice chimpanzee?\n\n00:03:14.238 --> 00:03:15.891\nAre you an evil chimpanzee?\n\n00:03:15.915 --> 00:03:17.359\nAre you trustworthy?\n\n00:03:17.383 --> 00:03:20.436\nIf I don't know you, how can I\ncooperate with you?\n\n00:03:21.634 --> 00:03:25.385\nThe only animal that can combine\nthe two abilities together\n\n00:03:25.409 --> 00:03:30.705\nand cooperate both flexibly\nand still do so in very large numbers\n\n00:03:30.729 --> 00:03:32.359\nis us, Homo sapiens.\n\n00:03:32.931 --> 00:03:37.062\nOne versus one, or even 10 versus 10,\n\n00:03:37.086 --> 00:03:39.655\nchimpanzees might be better than us.\n\n00:03:40.070 --> 00:03:45.249\nBut, if you pit 1,000 humans\nagainst 1,000 chimpanzees,\n\n00:03:45.273 --> 00:03:48.891\nthe humans will win easily,\nfor the simple reason\n\n00:03:48.915 --> 00:03:52.648\nthat a thousand chimpanzees\ncannot cooperate at all.\n\n00:03:53.295 --> 00:03:57.346\nAnd if you now try to cram\n100,000 chimpanzees\n\n00:03:57.370 --> 00:04:00.986\ninto Oxford Street,\nor into Wembley Stadium,\n\n00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:03.542\nor Tienanmen Square or the Vatican,\n\n00:04:03.566 --> 00:04:06.183\nyou will get chaos, complete chaos.\n\n00:04:06.207 --> 00:04:10.066\nJust imagine Wembley Stadium\nwith 100,000 chimpanzees.\n\n00:04:10.574 --> 00:04:11.764\nComplete madness.\n\n00:04:12.177 --> 00:04:18.119\nIn contrast, humans normally\ngather there in tens of thousands,\n\n00:04:18.143 --> 00:04:21.207\nand what we get is not chaos, usually.\n\n00:04:21.231 --> 00:04:27.318\nWhat we get is extremely sophisticated\nand effective networks of cooperation.\n\n00:04:28.512 --> 00:04:33.102\nAll the huge achievements\nof humankind throughout history,\n\n00:04:33.126 --> 00:04:36.409\nwhether it's building the pyramids\nor flying to the moon,\n\n00:04:36.433 --> 00:04:39.008\nhave been based not\non individual abilities,\n\n00:04:39.032 --> 00:04:42.857\nbut on this ability to cooperate\nflexibly in large numbers.\n\n00:04:43.423 --> 00:04:47.080\nThink even about this very talk\nthat I'm giving now:\n\n00:04:47.104 --> 00:04:53.088\nI'm standing here in front of an audience\nof about 300 or 400 people,\n\n00:04:53.112 --> 00:04:56.236\nmost of you are complete strangers to me.\n\n00:04:56.886 --> 00:05:01.870\nSimilarly, I don't really know\nall the people who have organized\n\n00:05:01.894 --> 00:05:03.521\nand worked on this event.\n\n00:05:03.952 --> 00:05:07.745\nI don't know the pilot\nand the crew members of the plane\n\n00:05:07.769 --> 00:05:10.680\nthat brought me over here,\nyesterday, to London.\n\n00:05:11.244 --> 00:05:14.967\nI don't know the people\nwho invented and manufactured\n\n00:05:14.991 --> 00:05:19.501\nthis microphone and these cameras,\nwhich are recording what I'm saying.\n\n00:05:20.081 --> 00:05:23.618\nI don't know the people\nwho wrote all the books and articles\n\n00:05:23.642 --> 00:05:26.035\nthat I read in preparation for this talk.\n\n00:05:26.453 --> 00:05:29.263\nAnd I certainly don't know all the people\n\n00:05:29.287 --> 00:05:32.506\nwho might be watching this talk\nover the Internet,\n\n00:05:32.530 --> 00:05:35.557\nsomewhere in Buenos Aires or in New Delhi.\n\n00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:39.629\nNevertheless, even though\nwe don't know each other,\n\n00:05:39.653 --> 00:05:45.506\nwe can work together to create\nthis global exchange of ideas.\n\n00:05:46.039 --> 00:05:49.090\nThis is something chimpanzees cannot do.\n\n00:05:49.114 --> 00:05:50.928\nThey communicate, of course,\n\n00:05:50.952 --> 00:05:56.751\nbut you will never catch a chimpanzee\ntraveling to some distant chimpanzee band\n\n00:05:56.775 --> 00:06:00.895\nto give them a talk about bananas\nor about elephants,\n\n00:06:00.919 --> 00:06:03.927\nor anything else that might\ninterest chimpanzees.\n\n00:06:05.347 --> 00:06:08.837\nNow cooperation is, of course,\nnot always nice;\n\n00:06:08.861 --> 00:06:12.886\nall the horrible things humans\nhave been doing throughout history --\n\n00:06:12.910 --> 00:06:15.649\nand we have been doing\nsome very horrible things --\n\n00:06:15.673 --> 00:06:20.822\nall those things are also based\non large-scale cooperation.\n\n00:06:20.846 --> 00:06:23.442\nPrisons are a system of cooperation;\n\n00:06:23.466 --> 00:06:26.456\nslaughterhouses are a system\nof cooperation;\n\n00:06:26.480 --> 00:06:29.484\nconcentration camps\nare a system of cooperation.\n\n00:06:29.865 --> 00:06:35.045\nChimpanzees don't have slaughterhouses\nand prisons and concentration camps.\n\n00:06:36.141 --> 00:06:39.971\nNow suppose I've managed\nto convince you perhaps that yes,\n\n00:06:39.995 --> 00:06:45.053\nwe control the world because we can\ncooperate flexibly in large numbers.\n\n00:06:45.474 --> 00:06:48.422\nThe next question that immediately arises\n\n00:06:48.446 --> 00:06:51.329\nin the mind of an inquisitive listener is:\n\n00:06:51.353 --> 00:06:53.637\nHow, exactly, do we do it?\n\n00:06:54.041 --> 00:06:59.823\nWhat enables us alone, of all the animals,\nto cooperate in such a way?\n\n00:07:01.672 --> 00:07:04.218\nThe answer is our imagination.\n\n00:07:04.956 --> 00:07:10.388\nWe can cooperate flexibly\nwith countless numbers of strangers,\n\n00:07:10.412 --> 00:07:14.108\nbecause we alone, of all\nthe animals on the planet,\n\n00:07:14.132 --> 00:07:18.755\ncan create and believe fictions,\nfictional stories.\n\n00:07:19.284 --> 00:07:23.872\nAnd as long as everybody believes\nin the same fiction,\n\n00:07:23.896 --> 00:07:27.438\neverybody obeys and follows\nthe same rules,\n\n00:07:27.462 --> 00:07:29.751\nthe same norms, the same values.\n\n00:07:30.597 --> 00:07:34.496\nAll other animals use\ntheir communication system\n\n00:07:34.520 --> 00:07:37.016\nonly to describe reality.\n\n00:07:37.548 --> 00:07:41.765\nA chimpanzee may say, \"Look!\nThere's a lion, let's run away!\"\n\n00:07:41.789 --> 00:07:45.895\nOr, \"Look! There's a banana tree\nover there! Let's go and get bananas!\"\n\n00:07:45.919 --> 00:07:52.196\nHumans, in contrast, use their language\nnot merely to describe reality,\n\n00:07:52.220 --> 00:07:56.744\nbut also to create new realities,\nfictional realities.\n\n00:07:57.236 --> 00:08:01.190\nA human can say, \"Look,\nthere is a god above the clouds!\n\n00:08:01.214 --> 00:08:03.294\nAnd if you don't do what I tell you to do,\n\n00:08:03.318 --> 00:08:06.523\nwhen you die, God will punish you\nand send you to hell.\"\n\n00:08:06.944 --> 00:08:10.716\nAnd if you all believe this story\nthat I've invented,\n\n00:08:10.740 --> 00:08:14.555\nthen you will follow the same\nnorms and laws and values,\n\n00:08:14.579 --> 00:08:15.871\nand you can cooperate.\n\n00:08:16.236 --> 00:08:18.586\nThis is something only humans can do.\n\n00:08:19.165 --> 00:08:23.006\nYou can never convince a chimpanzee\nto give you a banana\n\n00:08:23.030 --> 00:08:26.823\nby promising him, \"... after you die,\nyou'll go to chimpanzee heaven ...\"\n\n00:08:26.847 --> 00:08:27.870\n(Laughter)\n\n00:08:27.894 --> 00:08:31.156\n\"... and you'll receive lots and lots\nof bananas for your good deeds.\n\n00:08:31.180 --> 00:08:32.602\nSo now give me this banana.\"\n\n00:08:32.626 --> 00:08:35.384\nNo chimpanzee will ever\nbelieve such a story.\n\n00:08:35.734 --> 00:08:38.424\nOnly humans believe such stories,\n\n00:08:38.448 --> 00:08:40.531\nwhich is why we control the world,\n\n00:08:40.555 --> 00:08:45.400\nwhereas the chimpanzees are locked up\nin zoos and research laboratories.\n\n00:08:46.862 --> 00:08:49.802\nNow you may find it acceptable that yes,\n\n00:08:49.826 --> 00:08:55.966\nin the religious field, humans cooperate\nby believing in the same fictions.\n\n00:08:55.990 --> 00:09:00.942\nMillions of people come together\nto build a cathedral or a mosque\n\n00:09:00.966 --> 00:09:06.708\nor fight in a crusade or a jihad, because\nthey all believe in the same stories\n\n00:09:06.732 --> 00:09:09.445\nabout God and heaven and hell.\n\n00:09:09.937 --> 00:09:15.176\nBut what I want to emphasize\nis that exactly the same mechanism\n\n00:09:15.200 --> 00:09:21.064\nunderlies all other forms\nof mass-scale human cooperation,\n\n00:09:21.088 --> 00:09:23.608\nnot only in the religious field.\n\n00:09:23.632 --> 00:09:25.910\nTake, for example, the legal field.\n\n00:09:26.489 --> 00:09:32.466\nMost legal systems today in the world\nare based on a belief in human rights.\n\n00:09:33.205 --> 00:09:34.982\nBut what are human rights?\n\n00:09:35.554 --> 00:09:40.256\nHuman rights, just like God and heaven,\nare just a story that we've invented.\n\n00:09:40.280 --> 00:09:42.598\nThey are not an objective reality;\n\n00:09:42.622 --> 00:09:46.288\nthey are not some biological effect\nabout homo sapiens.\n\n00:09:46.677 --> 00:09:50.476\nTake a human being,\ncut him open, look inside,\n\n00:09:50.500 --> 00:09:55.627\nyou will find the heart, the kidneys,\nneurons, hormones, DNA,\n\n00:09:55.651 --> 00:09:57.539\nbut you won't find any rights.\n\n00:09:58.158 --> 00:10:02.079\nThe only place you find rights\nare in the stories\n\n00:10:02.103 --> 00:10:06.236\nthat we have invented and spread around\nover the last few centuries.\n\n00:10:06.565 --> 00:10:11.495\nThey may be very positive stories,\nvery good stories,\n\n00:10:11.519 --> 00:10:15.082\nbut they're still just fictional stories\nthat we've invented.\n\n00:10:15.622 --> 00:10:18.142\nThe same is true of the political field.\n\n00:10:18.523 --> 00:10:24.893\nThe most important factors\nin modern politics are states and nations.\n\n00:10:25.291 --> 00:10:27.091\nBut what are states and nations?\n\n00:10:27.551 --> 00:10:29.676\nThey are not an objective reality.\n\n00:10:29.700 --> 00:10:32.413\nA mountain is an objective reality.\n\n00:10:32.437 --> 00:10:35.721\nYou can see it, you can touch it,\nyou can even smell it.\n\n00:10:36.181 --> 00:10:37.953\nBut a nation or a state,\n\n00:10:37.977 --> 00:10:41.757\nlike Israel or Iran or France or Germany,\n\n00:10:41.781 --> 00:10:44.521\nthis is just a story that we've invented\n\n00:10:44.545 --> 00:10:46.519\nand became extremely attached to.\n\n00:10:46.907 --> 00:10:49.411\nThe same is true of the economic field.\n\n00:10:49.850 --> 00:10:53.556\nThe most important actors today\nin the global economy\n\n00:10:53.580 --> 00:10:55.842\nare companies and corporations.\n\n00:10:56.365 --> 00:11:00.096\nMany of you today, perhaps, work\nfor a corporation,\n\n00:11:00.120 --> 00:11:03.170\nlike Google or Toyota or McDonald's.\n\n00:11:03.535 --> 00:11:05.353\nWhat exactly are these things?\n\n00:11:05.940 --> 00:11:09.887\nThey are what lawyers call legal fictions.\n\n00:11:10.317 --> 00:11:13.793\nThey are stories invented and maintained\n\n00:11:13.817 --> 00:11:17.150\nby the powerful wizards we call lawyers.\n\n00:11:17.174 --> 00:11:18.619\n(Laughter)\n\n00:11:18.643 --> 00:11:22.062\nAnd what do corporations do all day?\n\n00:11:22.086 --> 00:11:24.939\nMostly, they try to make money.\n\n00:11:25.369 --> 00:11:26.702\nYet, what is money?\n\n00:11:26.726 --> 00:11:31.892\nAgain, money is not an objective reality;\nit has no objective value.\n\n00:11:31.916 --> 00:11:35.233\nTake this green piece\nof paper, the dollar bill.\n\n00:11:35.257 --> 00:11:37.634\nLook at it -- it has no value.\n\n00:11:37.658 --> 00:11:39.892\nYou cannot eat it, you cannot drink it,\n\n00:11:39.916 --> 00:11:41.208\nyou cannot wear it.\n\n00:11:41.591 --> 00:11:45.632\nBut then came along\nthese master storytellers --\n\n00:11:45.656 --> 00:11:47.140\nthe big bankers,\n\n00:11:47.164 --> 00:11:48.604\nthe finance ministers,\n\n00:11:48.628 --> 00:11:49.982\nthe prime ministers --\n\n00:11:50.006 --> 00:11:52.484\nand they tell us a very convincing story:\n\n00:11:52.508 --> 00:11:54.466\n\"Look, you see this green piece of paper?\n\n00:11:54.490 --> 00:11:57.073\nIt is actually worth 10 bananas.\"\n\n00:11:57.549 --> 00:11:59.658\nAnd if I believe it, and you believe it,\n\n00:11:59.682 --> 00:12:01.198\nand everybody believes it,\n\n00:12:01.222 --> 00:12:03.086\nit actually works.\n\n00:12:03.110 --> 00:12:06.023\nI can take this worthless piece of paper,\n\n00:12:06.047 --> 00:12:07.684\ngo to the supermarket,\n\n00:12:07.708 --> 00:12:11.715\ngive it to a complete stranger\nwhom I've never met before,\n\n00:12:11.739 --> 00:12:16.424\nand get, in exchange, real bananas\nwhich I can actually eat.\n\n00:12:16.828 --> 00:12:18.549\nThis is something amazing.\n\n00:12:18.573 --> 00:12:20.651\nYou could never do it with chimpanzees.\n\n00:12:20.675 --> 00:12:22.620\nChimpanzees trade, of course:\n\n00:12:22.644 --> 00:12:25.394\n\"Yes, you give me a coconut,\nI'll give you a banana.\"\n\n00:12:25.418 --> 00:12:26.656\nThat can work.\n\n00:12:26.680 --> 00:12:29.672\nBut, you give me\na worthless piece of paper\n\n00:12:29.696 --> 00:12:31.710\nand you except me to give you a banana?\n\n00:12:31.734 --> 00:12:32.886\nNo way!\n\n00:12:32.910 --> 00:12:34.491\nWhat do you think I am, a human?\n\n00:12:34.515 --> 00:12:36.888\n(Laughter)\n\n00:12:36.912 --> 00:12:41.031\nMoney, in fact, is\nthe most successful story\n\n00:12:41.055 --> 00:12:43.711\never invented and told by humans,\n\n00:12:43.735 --> 00:12:48.078\nbecause it is the only story\neverybody believes.\n\n00:12:48.650 --> 00:12:51.440\nNot everybody believes in God,\n\n00:12:51.464 --> 00:12:54.489\nnot everybody believes in human rights,\n\n00:12:54.513 --> 00:12:57.298\nnot everybody believes in nationalism,\n\n00:12:57.322 --> 00:13:01.065\nbut everybody believes in money,\nand in the dollar bill.\n\n00:13:01.472 --> 00:13:03.453\nTake, even, Osama Bin Laden.\n\n00:13:03.477 --> 00:13:07.164\nHe hated American politics\nand American religion\n\n00:13:07.188 --> 00:13:08.637\nand American culture,\n\n00:13:08.661 --> 00:13:11.467\nbut he had no objection\nto American dollars.\n\n00:13:11.491 --> 00:13:13.586\nHe was quite fond of them, actually.\n\n00:13:13.610 --> 00:13:15.513\n(Laughter)\n\n00:13:16.124 --> 00:13:17.824\nTo conclude, then:\n\n00:13:17.848 --> 00:13:23.616\nWe humans control the world\nbecause we live in a dual reality.\n\n00:13:24.489 --> 00:13:28.402\nAll other animals live\nin an objective reality.\n\n00:13:28.950 --> 00:13:33.502\nTheir reality consists\nof objective entities,\n\n00:13:33.526 --> 00:13:37.469\nlike rivers and trees\nand lions and elephants.\n\n00:13:38.025 --> 00:13:41.708\nWe humans, we also live\nin an objective reality.\n\n00:13:41.732 --> 00:13:46.800\nIn our world, too,

I document what these groups do when they're not shooting. My goal is to better understand these violent actors and to study ways to encourage transition from violent engagement to nonviolent confrontation. I work in the field, in the policy world and in the library.Understanding non-state armed groups is key to solving most ongoing conflict, because war has changed. It used to be a contest between states. No longer. It is now a conflict between states and non-state actors. For example, of the 216 peace agreements signed between 1975 and 2011, 196 of them were between a state and a non-state actor. So we need to understand these groups; we need to either engage them or defeat them in any conflict resolution process that has to be successful.So how do we do that? We need to know what makes these organizations tick. We know a lot about how they fight, why they fight, but no one looks at what they're doing when they're not fighting. Yet, armed struggle and unarmed politics are related. It is all part of the same organization. We cannot understand these groups, let alone defeat them, if we don't have the full picture.And armed groups today are complex organizations. Take the Lebanese Hezbollah, known for its violent confrontation against Israel. But since its creation in the early 1980s, Hezbollah has also set up a political party, a social-service network, and a military apparatus. Similarly, the Palestinian Hamas, known for its suicide attacks against Israel, also runs the Gaza Strip since 2007. So these groups do way more than just shoot. They multi-task. They set up complex communication machines \u2014 radio stations, TV channels, Internet websites and social media strategies. And up here, you have the ISIS magazine, printed in English and published to recruit. Armed groups also invest in complex fund-raising \u2014 not looting, but setting up profitable businesses; for example, construction companies. Now, these activities are keys. They allow these groups to increase their strength, increase their funds, to better recruit and to build their brand.Armed groups also do something else: they build stronger bonds with the population by investing in social services. They build schools, they run hospitals, they set up vocational-training programs or micro-loan programs. Hezbollah offers all of these services and more. Armed groups also seek to win the population over by offering something that the state is not providing: safety and security. The initial rise of the Taliban in war-torn Afghanistan, or even the beginning of the ascent of ISIS, can be understood also by looking at these groups' efforts to provide security. Now, unfortunately, in these cases, the provision of security came at an unbearably high price for the population. But in general, providing social services fills a gap, a governance gap left by the government, and allows these groups to increase their strength and their power. For example, the 2006 electoral victory of the Palestinian Hamas cannot be understood without acknowledging the group's social work.Now, this is a really complex picture, yet in the West, when we look at armed groups, we only think of the violent side. But that's not enough to understand these groups' strength, strategy or long-term vision. These groups are hybrid. They rise because they fill a gap left by the government, and they emerge to be both armed and political, engage in violent struggle and provide governance.And the more these organizations are complex and sophisticated, the less we can think of them as the opposite of a state. Now, what do you call a group like Hezbollah? They run part of a territory, they administer all their functions, they pick up the garbage, they run the sewage system. Is this a state? Is it a rebel group? Or maybe something else, something different and new? And what about ISIS? The lines are blurred. We live in a world of states, non-states, and in-between, and the more states are weak, like in the Middle East today, the more non-state actors step in and fill that gap. This matters for governments, because to counter these groups, they will have to invest more in non-military tools. Filling that governance gap has to be at the center of any sustainable approach. This also matters very much for peacemaking and peacebuilding. If we better understand armed groups, we will better know what incentives to offer to encourage the transition from violence to nonviolence.So in this new contest between states and non-states, military power can win some battles, but it will not give us peace nor stability. To achieve these objectives, what we need is a long-term investment in filling that security gap, in filling that governance gap that allowed these groups to thrive in the first place.Thank

It's a seductive place, isn't it?I don't live there. (Laughter) But I did journey on a 27,000-mile trip for two years, to the fastest-growing and whitest counties in America.What is a Whitopia? I define Whitopia in three ways: First, a Whitopia has posted at least six percent population growth since 2000. Secondly, the majority of that growth comes from white migrants. And third, the Whitopia has an ineffable charm, a pleasant look and feel, a je Ne sais quoi. (Laughter)To learn how and why Whitopias are ticking, I immersed myself for several months apiece in three of them: first, St. George, Utah; second, Coeur d'Alene, Idaho; and third, Forsyth County, Georgia.First stop, St. George \u2014 a beautiful town of red rock landscapes. In the 1850s, Brigham Young dispatched families to St. George to grow cotton because of the hot, arid climate. And so they called it Utah's Dixie, and the name sticks to this day. I approached my time in each Whitopia like an anthropologist. I made detailed spreadsheets of all the power brokers in the communities, who I needed to meet, where I needed to be, and I threw myself with gusto in these communities. I went to zoning board meetings, I went to Democratic clubs and Republican clubs. I went to poker nights. In St. George, I rented a home at the Entrada, one of the town's premier gated communities. There were no Motel 6's or Howard Johnsons for me. I lived in Whitopia as a resident, and not like a visitor.I rented myself this home by phone. (Laughter) (Applause)Golf is the perfect seductive symbol of Whitopia. When I went on my journey, I had barely ever held a golf club. By the time I left, I was golfing at least three times a week. (Laughter)Golf helps people bond. Some of the best interviews I ever scored during my trip were on the golf courses. One venture capitalist, for example, invited me to golf in his private club that had no minority members.I also went fishing. (Laughter) Because I had never fished, this fellow had to teach me how to cast my line and what bait to use.I also played poker every weekend. It was Texas Hold 'em with a $10 buy-in. My poker mates may have been bluffing about the hands that they drew, but they weren't bluffing about their social beliefs. Some of the most raw, salty conversations I ever had during my journey were at the poker table.I'm a gung ho entertainer. I love to cook, I hosted many dinner parties, and in return, people invited me to their dinner parties, and to their barbecues, and to their pool parties, and to their birthday parties.But it wasn't all fun. Immigration turned out to be a big issue in this Whitopia. The St. George's Citizens Council on Illegal Immigration held regular and active protests against immigration, and so what I gleaned from this Whitopia is what a hot debate this would become. It was a real-time preview, and so it has become.Next stop: Almost Heaven, a cabin I rented for myself in Coeur d'Alene, in the beautiful North Idaho panhandle. I rented this place for myself, also by phone. (Laughter)The book \"A Thousand Places To See Before You Die\" lists Coeur d'Alene \u2014 it's a gorgeous paradise for huntsmen, boatmen and fishermen.My growing golf skills came in handy in Coeur d'Alene. I golfed with retired LAPD cops. In 1993, around 11,000 families and cops fled Los Angeles after the L.A. racial unrest, for North Idaho, and they've built an expatriated community. Given the conservatism of these cops, there's no surprise that North Idaho has a strong gun culture. In fact, it is said, North Idaho has more gun dealers than gas stations. So what's a resident to do to fit in? I hit the gun club. When I rented a gun, the gentleman behind the counter was perfectly pleasant and kind, until I showed him my New York City driver's license. That's when he got nervous. I'm not as bad a shot as I thought I might have been.What I learned from North Idaho is the peculiar brand of paranoia that can permeate a community when so many cops and guns are around.In North Idaho, in my red pickup truck, I kept a notepad. And in that notepad I counted more Confederate flags than black people. In North Idaho, I found Confederate flags on key chains, on cellphone paraphernalia, and on cars.About a seven-minute drive from my hidden lake cabin was the compound of Aryan Nations, the white supremacist group. America's Promise Ministries, the religious arm of Aryan Nations, happened to have a three-day retreat during my visit. So I decided to crash it. (Laughter) I'm the only non-Aryan journalist I'm aware of ever to have done so. (Laughter) Among the many memorable episodes of that retreat... (Laughter) ...is when Abe, an Aryan, sidled up next to me. He slapped my knee, and he said, \"Hey Rich, I just want you to know one thing. We are not white supremacists. We are white separatists. We don't think we're better than you, we just want to be away from you.\" (Laughter)Indeed, most white people in Whitopia are neither white supremacists or white separatists; in fact, they're not there for explicitly racial reasons at all. Rather, they emigrate there for friendliness, comfort, security, safety \u2014 reasons that they implicitly associate to whiteness in itself.Next stop was Georgia. In Georgia, I stayed in an exurb north of Atlanta. In Utah, I found poker; in Idaho, I found guns; in Georgia, I found God. (Laughter) The way that I immersed myself in this Whitopia was to become active at First Redeemer Church, a megachurch that's so huge that it has golf carts to escort the congregants around its many parking lots on campus. I was active in the youth ministry. And for me, personally, I was more comfortable in this Whitopia than say, in a Colorado, or an Idaho, or even a suburban Boston. That is because [there], in Georgia, white people and black people are more historically familiar to one another. I was less exotic in this Whitopia. (Laughter)But what does it all mean? Whitopian dreaming, Whitopia migration, is a push-pull phenomenon, full of alarming pushes and alluring pulls, and Whitopia operates at the level of conscious and unconscious bias. It's possible for people to be in Whitopia not for racist reasons, though it has racist outcomes. Many Whitopians feel pushed by illegals, social welfare abuse, minorities, density, crowded schools. Many Whitopians feel pulled by merit, freedom, the allure of privatism \u2014 privatized places, privatized people, privatized things. And I learned in Whitopia how a country can have racism without racists.Many of my smug urban liberal friends couldn't believe I would go on such a venture. The reality is that many white Americans are affable and kind. Interpersonal race relations \u2014 how we treat each other as human beings \u2014 are vastly better than in my parents' generation. Can you imagine me going to Whitopia 40 years ago? What a journey that would have been. (Laughter) And yet, some things haven't changed. America is as residentially and educationally segregated today as it was in 1970.As Americans, we often find ways to cook for each other, to dance with each other, to host with each other, but why can't that translate into how we treat each other as communities? It's a devastating irony, how we have gone forward as individuals, and backwards as communities.One of the Whitopian outlooks that really hit me was a proverbial saying: \"One black man is a delightful dinner guest; 50 black men is a ghetto.\"One of the big contexts animating my Whitopian journey was the year 2042. By 2042, white people will no longer be the American majority. As such, will there be more Whitopias? In looking at this, the danger of Whitopia is that the more segregation we have, the less we can look at and confront conscious and unconscious bias.I ventured on my two-year, 27,000 mile journey to learn where, why, and how white people are fleeing, but I didn't expect to have so much fun on my journey. (Laughter) I didn't expect to learn so much about myself. I don't expect I'll be living in a Whitopia \u2014 or a Blacktopia, for that matter. I do plan to continue golfing every chance I get. (Laughter) And I'll just have to leave the guns and megachurches back in Whitopia.Thank you.(Applause)", "id": 2308, "subtitle":

00:07:29.017\n(Laughter)\n\n00:07:29.041 --> 00:07:32.933\n...is when Abe, an Aryan,\nsidled up next to me.\n\n00:07:32.957 --> 00:07:38.377\nHe slapped my knee, and he said, \"Hey\nRich, I just want you to know one thing.\n\n00:07:38.401 --> 00:07:42.901\nWe are not white supremacists.\nWe are white separatists.\n\n00:07:42.925 --> 00:07:44.799\nWe don't think we're better than you,\n\n00:07:44.823 --> 00:07:46.512\nwe just want to be away from you.\"\n\n00:07:46.536 --> 00:07:50.950\n(Laughter)\n\n00:07:50.974 --> 00:07:57.969\nIndeed, most white people in Whitopia\nare neither white supremacists\n\n00:07:57.993 --> 00:07:59.808\nor white separatists;\n\n00:07:59.832 --> 00:08:03.757\nin fact, they're not there\nfor explicitly racial reasons at all.\n\n00:08:04.098 --> 00:08:07.154\nRather, they emigrate there\n\n00:08:07.178 --> 00:08:10.886\nfor friendliness, comfort,\nsecurity, safety --\n\n00:08:10.910 --> 00:08:15.903\nreasons that they implicitly associate\nto whiteness in itself.\n\n00:08:17.022 --> 00:08:18.896\nNext stop was Georgia.\n\n00:08:20.182 --> 00:08:24.294\nIn Georgia, I stayed in an exurb\nnorth of Atlanta.\n\n00:08:24.985 --> 00:08:26.780\nIn Utah, I found poker;\n\n00:08:26.804 --> 00:08:28.495\nin Idaho, I found guns;\n\n00:08:28.519 --> 00:08:30.073\nin Georgia, I found God.\n\n00:08:30.097 --> 00:08:31.336\n(Laughter)\n\n00:08:31.360 --> 00:08:34.933\nThe way that I immersed myself\nin this Whitopia\n\n00:08:34.957 --> 00:08:38.348\nwas to become active\nat First Redeemer Church,\n\n00:08:38.372 --> 00:08:41.876\na megachurch that's so huge\nthat it has golf carts\n\n00:08:41.900 --> 00:08:47.065\nto escort the congregants around\nits many parking lots on campus.\n\n00:08:47.716 --> 00:08:50.425\nI was active in the youth ministry.\n\n00:08:50.449 --> 00:08:55.381\nAnd for me, personally,\nI was more comfortable in this Whitopia\n\n00:08:55.405 --> 00:09:00.038\nthan say, in a Colorado, or an Idaho,\nor even a suburban Boston.\n\n00:09:00.957 --> 00:09:04.047\nThat is because [there], in Georgia,\n\n00:09:04.071 --> 00:09:08.590\nwhite people and black people are more\nhistorically familiar to one another.\n\n00:09:09.050 --> 00:09:11.846\nI was less exotic in this Whitopia.\n\n00:09:11.870 --> 00:09:13.870\n(Laughter)\n\n00:09:14.642 --> 00:09:16.229\nBut what does it all mean?\n\n00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:22.381\nWhitopian dreaming, Whitopia migration,\nis a push-pull phenomenon,\n\n00:09:22.405 --> 00:09:26.546\nfull of alarming pushes\nand alluring pulls,\n\n00:09:26.570 --> 00:09:33.183\nand Whitopia operates at the level\nof conscious and unconscious bias.\n\n00:09:33.818 --> 00:09:39.221\nIt's possible for people to be in Whitopia\nnot for racist reasons,\n\n00:09:39.245 --> 00:09:41.535\nthough it has racist outcomes.\n\n00:09:43.662 --> 00:09:47.506\nMany Whitopians feel pushed by illegals,\n\n00:09:47.530 --> 00:09:53.047\nsocial welfare abuse, minorities,\ndensity, crowded schools.\n\n00:09:53.071 --> 00:09:58.250\nMany Whitopians feel pulled by merit,\n\n00:09:58.274 --> 00:10:04.038\nfreedom, the allure of privatism --\nprivatized places, privatized people,\n\n00:10:04.062 --> 00:10:05.379\nprivatized things.\n\n00:10:07.482 --> 00:10:13.070\nAnd I learned in Whitopia\nhow a country can have racism\n\n00:10:13.094 --> 00:10:14.429\nwithout racists.\n\n00:10:15.199 --> 00:10:17.986\nMany of my smug urban liberal friends\n\n00:10:18.010 --> 00:10:20.747\ncouldn't believe I would go\non such a venture.\n\n00:10:21.405 --> 00:10:26.927\nThe reality is that many white Americans\nare affable and kind.\n\n00:10:27.601 --> 00:10:32.370\nInterpersonal race relations --\nhow we treat each other as human beings --\n\n00:10:32.394 --> 00:10:36.001\nare vastly better than in\nmy parents' generation.\n\n00:10:37.120 --> 00:10:40.743\nCan you imagine me going\nto Whitopia 40 years ago?\n\n00:10:41.554 --> 00:10:43.442\nWhat a journey that would have been.\n\n00:10:43.466 --> 00:10:45.224\n(Laughter)\n\n00:10:45.248 --> 00:10:47.117\nAnd yet, some things haven't changed.\n\n00:10:47.530 --> 00:10:54.241\nAmerica is as residentially\nand educationally segregated today\n\n00:10:54.265 --> 00:10:56.832\nas it was in 1970.\n\n00:10:59.481 --> 00:11:04.112\nAs Americans, we often find ways\nto cook for each other,\n\n00:11:04.136 --> 00:11:05.756\nto dance with each other,\n\n00:11:05.780 --> 00:11:07.653\nto host with each other,\n\n00:11:07.677 --> 00:11:12.725\nbut why can't that translate into how we\ntreat each other as communities?\n\n00:11:13.193 --> 00:11:15.313\nIt's a devastating irony,\n\n00:11:15.337 --> 00:11:18.649\nhow we have gone forward as individuals,\n\n00:11:18.673 --> 00:11:21.283\nand backwards as communities.\n\n00:11:23.724 --> 00:11:28.017\nOne of the Whitopian outlooks\nthat really hit me\n\n00:11:28.041 --> 00:11:30.213\nwas a proverbial saying:\n\n00:11:30.237 --> 00:11:33.713\n\"One black man is\na delightful dinner guest;\n\n00:11:33.737 --> 00:11:35.779\n50 black men is a ghetto.\"\n\n00:11:40.837 --> 00:11:47.713\nOne of the big contexts animating\nmy Whitopian journey was the year 2042.\n\n00:11:48.626 --> 00:11:54.734\nBy 2042, white people will no longer be\nthe American majority.\n\n00:11:55.408 --> 00:11:58.709\nAs such, will there be more Whitopias?\n\n00:12:00.884 --> 00:12:02.571\nIn looking at this,\n\n00:12:02.595 --> 00:12:09.302\nthe danger of Whitopia is\nthat the more segregation we have,\n\n00:12:09.326 --> 00:12:15.127\nthe less we can look at and confront\nconscious and unconscious bias.\n\n00:12:18.262 --> 00:12:22.623\nI ventured on my two-year,\n27,000 mile journey\n\n00:12:22.647 --> 00:12:27.734\nto learn where, why, and how\nwhite people are fleeing,\n\n00:12:27.758 --> 00:12:30.500\nbut I didn't expect to have\nso much fun on my journey.\n\n00:12:30.524 --> 00:12:31.531\n(Laughter)\n\n00:12:31.555 --> 00:12:34.445\nI didn't expect to learn\nso much about myself.\n\n00:12:35.366 --> 00:12:38.814\nI don't expect I'll be living\nin a Whitopia --\n\n00:12:38.838 --> 00:12:40.949\nor a Blacktopia, for that matter.\n\n00:12:41.750 --> 00:12:45.159\nI do plan to continue golfing\nevery chance I get.\n\n00:12:45.183 --> 00:12:46.745\n(Laughter)\n\n00:12:46.769 --> 00:12:51.394\nAnd I'll just have to leave the guns\nand megachurches back in Whitopia.\n\n00:12:52.672 --> 00:12:53.824\nThank you.\n\n00:12:53.848 -->

love. He says, \"Don't hate the media. Be the media.\" I'm an artist. I like working with media and technology because A, I'm familiar with them and I like the power they hold. And B, I hate them and I'm terrified of the power they hold.(Laughter)I remember watching, in 2003, an interview between Fox News host Tony Snow and then-US Defense Secretary, Donald Rumsfeld. They were talking about the recent invasion of Iraq, and Rumsfeld is asked the question, \"Well, we're hear about our body counts, but we never hear about theirs, why?\" And Rumsfeld's answer is, \"Well, we don't do body counts on other people.\" Right?It's estimated that between 150,000 to one million Iraqis, civilians, have died as a result of the US-led invasion in 2003. That number is in stark contrast with the 4,486 US service members who died during that same window of time. I wanted to do more than just bring awareness to this terrifying number. I wanted to create a monument for the individual civilians who died as a result of the invasion.Monuments to war, such as Maya Lin's Vietnam Memorial, are often enormous in scale. Very powerful and very one-sided. I wanted my monument to live in the world, and to circulate. I remember when I was a boy in school, my teacher assigned us this classic civics assignment where you take a sheet of paper and you write a member of your government. And we were told, if we wrote a really good letter, if we really thought about it, we would get back more than just a simple formed letter as a reply.This is my \"Notepad.\" What looks like an everyday, yellow legal tablet of paper is actually a monument to the individual Iraqi civilians that died as a result of the US invasion. \"Notepad\" is an act of protest and an act of commemoration disguised as an everyday tablet of paper. The lines of the paper, when magnified, are revealed to be micro-printed text that contains the details, the names, the dates and locations of individual Iraqi civilians that died.So, for the last 5 years, I've been taking pads of this paper, tons of this stuff, and smuggling it into the stationery supplies of the United States and the Coalition governments.(Laughter)(Applause)I don't have to tell you guys this is not the place to discuss how I did that.(Laughter)But also, I've been meeting one-on-one with members and former members of the so-called Coalition of the Willing, who assisted in the invasion.And so, whenever I can, I meet with one of them, and I share the project with them. And last summer, I had the chance to meet with former United States Attorney General and Torture Memo author, Alberto Gonzales.(Video) Matt Kenyon: May I give this to you? This is a special legal tablet. It's actually part of an ongoing art project.Alberto Gonzalez: This is a special legal pad?MK: Yes. You won't believe me, but it's in the collection of the Museum of Modern Art; I'm an artist.MK: And all of the lines of the paper are actually \u2014AG: Are they going to disappear?MK: No, they're micro-printed text that contains the names of individual Iraqi civilians who have died since the invasion of Iraq.AG: Yeah. OK.AG: Thank you. MK: Thank you.(Laughter)The way he says \"thank you\" really creeps me out.(Laughter)OK, so I'd like each of you to look under your chairs. There's an envelope. And please open it. The paper you're holding in your hand contains the details of Iraqi civilians that died as result of the invasion. I'd like you to use this paper and write a member of government. You can help to smuggle this civilian body count into government archives. Because every letter that's sent in to the government, and this is all across the world, of course \u2014 every letter that is sent in is archived, filed and recorded. Together, we can put this in the mailboxes and under the noses of people in power. Everything that's sent in eventually becomes part of the permanent archive of our government, our shared historical record.Thank you.(Applause)Tom Rielly: So, tell me Matt, how did this idea come into your head, of \"Notepad\"?Matt Kenyon: I'd just finished a project that dealt with the US Coalition side of the war and it was a black armband that was called the \"Improvised Empathetic Device\" which accumulated, in real time, the names, ranks, cause of death and location of US service members who had died overseas, and each time the Department of Defense or CENTCOM released their data, it would stab me in the arm. And so, I became aware that there was a spectacle associated with our own people who were dying overseas, but a disproportionate amount of casualties were the civilian casualties.TR: Thank you so much.MK: Thank you.(Applause)", "id": 2306, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:13.233 --> 00:00:17.856\nThere's this quote by activist and punk\nrock

You swallow an aspirin. But for this pill to get to your head, where the pain is, it goes through your stomach, intestines and various other organs first.Swallowing pills is the most effective and painless way of delivering any medication in the body. The downside, though, is that swallowing any medication leads to its dilution. And this is a big problem, particularly in HIV patients. When they take their anti-HIV drugs, these drugs are good for lowering the virus in the blood, and increasing the CD4 cell counts. But they are also notorious for their adverse side effects, but mostly bad, because they get diluted by the time they get to the blood, and worse, by the time they get to the sites where it matters most: within the HIV viral reservoirs. These areas in the body \u2014 such as the lymph nodes, the nervous system, as well as the lungs \u2014 where the virus is sleeping, and will not readily get delivered in the blood of patients that are under consistent anti-HIV drugs therapy. However, upon discontinuation of therapy, the virus can awake and infect new cells in the blood.Now, all this is a big problem in treating HIV with the current drug treatment, which is a life-long treatment that must be swallowed by patients. One day, I sat and thought, \"Can we deliver anti-HIV directly within its reservoir sites, without the risk of drug dilution?\" As a laser scientist, the answer was just before my eyes: Lasers, of course. If they can be used for dentistry, for diabetic wound-healing and surgery, they can be used for anything imaginable, including transporting drugs into cells.As a matter of fact, we are currently using laser pulses to poke or drill extremely tiny holes, which open and close almost immediately in HIV-infected cells, in order to deliver drugs within them. \"How is that possible?\" you may ask. Well, we shine a very powerful but super-tiny laser beam onto the membrane of HIV-infected cells while these cells are immersed in liquid containing the drug. The laser pierces the cell, while the cell swallows the drug in a matter of microseconds. Before you even know it, the induced hole becomes immediately repaired.Now, we are currently testing this technology in test tubes or in Petri dishes, but the goal is to get this technology in the human body, apply it in the human body. \"How is that possible?\" you may ask. Well, the answer is: through a three-headed device. Using the first head, which is our laser, we will make an incision in the site of infection. Using the second head, which is a camera, we meander to the site of infection. Finally, using a third head, which is a drug-spreading sprinkler, we deliver the drugs directly at the site of infection, while the laser is again used to poke those cells open.Well, this might not seem like much right now. But one day, if successful, this technology can lead to complete eradication of HIV in the body. Yes. A cure for HIV.

(Laughter) Beyond flying, breathing fire, and making hot men spontaneously appear ... (Laughter) I can do things like read and write music. Fun fact is that I wrote my personal statement to college in a dream. And I did accepted. So, yeah.I am a very visual thinker. I think in pictures, not words. To me, words are more like instincts and language.There are many people like me; Nikola Tesla, for example, who could visualize, design, test, and troubleshoot everything \u2014 all of his inventions \u2014 in his mind, accurately.Language is kind of exclusive to our species, anyway. I am a bit more primitive, like a beta version of Google Translate. (Laughter)My brain has the ability to hyper-focus on things that interest me. For example, once I had an affair with calculus that lasted longer than some celebrity marriages. (Laughter)There are some other unusual things about me. You may have noticed that I don't have much inflection in my voice. That's why people often confuse me with a GPS. (Laughter) This can make basic communication a challenge, unless you need directions. (Laughter) Thank you. (Applause)A few years ago, when I started doing presentations, I went to get head shots done for the first time. The photographer told me to look flirty. (Laughter) And I had no idea what she was talking about. (Laughter)She said, \"Do that thing, you know, with your eyes, when you're flirting with guys.\"\"What thing?\" I asked.\"You know, squint.\"And so I tried, really. It looked something like this. (Laughter) I looked like I was searching for Waldo. (Laughter)There's a reason for this, as there is a reason that Waldo is hiding. (Laughter)I have Asperger's, a high-functioning form of autism that impairs the basic social skills one is expected to display. It's made life difficult in many ways, and growing up, I struggled to fit in socially. My friends would tell jokes, but I didn't understand them. My personal heroes were George Carlin and Stephen Colbert \u2014 and they taught me humor. My personality switched from being shy and awkward to being defiant and cursing out a storm. Needless to say, I did not have many friends. I was also hypersensitive to texture. The feel of water on my skin was like pins and needles, and so for years, I refused to shower. I can assure you that my hygiene routine is up to standards now, though. (Laughter)I had to do a lot to get here, and my parents \u2014 things kind of got out of control when I was sexually assaulted by a peer, and on top of everything, it made a difficult situation worse. And I had to travel 2,000 miles across the country to get treatment, but within days of them prescribing a new medication, my life turned into an episode of the Walking Dead. I became paranoid, and began to hallucinate that rotting corpses were coming towards me. My family finally rescued me, but by that time, I had lost 19 pounds in those three weeks, as well as developing severe anemia, and was on the verge of suicide.I transferred to a new treatment center that understood my aversions, my trauma, and my social anxiety, and they knew how to treat it, and I got the help I finally needed. And after 18 months of hard work, I went on to do incredible things.One of the things with Asperger's is that oftentimes, these people have a very complex inner life, and I know for myself, I have a very colorful personality, rich ideas, and just a lot going on in my mind. But there's a gap between where that stands, and how I communicate it with the rest of the world. And this can make basic communication a challenge.Not many places would hire me, due to my lack of social skills, which is why I applied to Waffle House. (Laughter) Waffle House is an exceptional 24-hour diner \u2014 (Laughter) (Applause) thank you \u2014 where you can order your hash browns the many ways that someone would dispose of a human corpse ... (Laughter) Sliced, diced, peppered, chunked, topped, capped, and covered. (Laughter) As social norms would have it, you should only go to Waffle House at an ungodly hour in the night. (Laughter) So one time, at 2 am, I was chatting with a waitress, and I asked her, \"What's the most ridiculous thing that's happened to you on the job?\" And she told me that one time, a man walked in completely naked. (Laughter) I said, \"Great! Sign me up for the graveyard shift!\" (Laughter) Needless to say, Waffle House did not hire me.So in terms of having Asperger's, it can be viewed as a disadvantage, and sometimes it is a real pain in the butt, but it's also the opposite. It's a gift, and it allows me to think innovatively. At 19, I won a research competition for my research on coral reefs, and I ended up speaking at the UN Convention of Biological Diversity, presenting this research. (Applause) Thank you. (Applause) And at 22, I'm getting ready to graduate college, and I am a co-founder of a biotech company called AutismSees. (Applause) Thank you. (Applause)But consider what I had to do to get here: 25 therapists, 11 misdiagnoses, and years of pain and trauma. I spent a lot of time thinking if there's a better way, and I think there is: autism-assistive technology. This technology could play an integral role in helping people with autistic spectrum disorder, or ASD.The app Podium, released by my company, AutismSees, has the ability to independently assess and help develop communication skills. In addition to this, it tracks eye contact through camera and simulates a public-speaking and job-interview experience. And so maybe one day, Waffle House will hire me, after practicing on it some more. (Laughter) And one of the great things is that I've used Podium to help me prepare for today, and it's been a great help. But it's more than that. There's more that can be done. For people with ASD \u2014 it has been speculated that many innovative scientists, researchers, artists, and engineers have it; like, for example, Emily Dickinson, Jane Austen, Isaac Newton, and Bill Gates are some examples. But the problem that's encountered is that these brilliant ideas often can't be shared if there are communication roadblocks. And so, many people with autism are being overlooked every day, and they're being taken advantage of. So my dream for people with autism is to change that, to remove the roadblocks that prevent them from succeeding.One of the reasons I love lucid dreaming is because it allows me to be free, without judgment of social and physical consequences. When I'm flying over scenes that I create in my mind, I am at peace. I am free from judgment, and so I can do whatever I want, you know? I'm making out with Brad Pitt, and Angelina is totally cool with it. (Laughter)But the goal of autism-assistive technology is bigger than that, and more important. My goal is to shift people's perspective of autism and people with higher-functioning Asperger's because there is a lot they can do. I mean, look at Temple Grandin, for example. And by doing so, we allow people to share their talents with this world and move this world forward. In addition, we give them the courage to pursue their dreams in the real world, in real time.Thank you.(Applause)Thank you.(Applause)", "id": 2310, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:12.704 --> 00:00:15.331\nToday, I want to talk to you about dreams.\n\n00:00:15.957 --> 00:00:18.674\nI have been a lucid dreamer my whole life,\n\n00:00:18.698 --> 00:00:20.674\nand it's cooler than in the movies.\n\n00:00:20.698 --> 00:00:22.641\n(Laughter)\n\n00:00:22.665 --> 00:00:25.373\nBeyond flying, breathing fire,\n\n00:00:25.397 --> 00:00:28.238\nand making hot men\nspontaneously appear ...\n\n00:00:28.262 --> 00:00:30.239\n(Laughter)\n\n00:00:30.263 --> 00:00:32.671\nI can do things like read and write music.\n\n00:00:33.302 --> 00:00:36.633\nFun fact is that I wrote\nmy personal statement to college\n\n00:00:36.657 --> 00:00:37.977\nin a dream.\n\n00:00:38.001 --> 00:00:40.756\nAnd I did accepted.

exclusive\nto our species, anyway.\n\n00:01:09.957 --> 00:01:12.067\nI am a bit more primitive,\n\n00:01:12.091 --> 00:01:14.659\nlike a beta version of Google Translate.\n\n00:01:14.683 --> 00:01:17.295\n(Laughter)\n\n00:01:18.699 --> 00:01:22.582\nMy brain has the ability\nto hyper-focus on things that interest me.\n\n00:01:23.265 --> 00:01:25.932\nFor example, once\nI had an affair with calculus\n\n00:01:25.956 --> 00:01:28.645\nthat lasted longer\nthan some celebrity marriages.\n\n00:01:28.669 --> 00:01:31.596\n(Laughter)\n\n00:01:32.485 --> 00:01:35.001\nThere are some other\nunusual things about me.\n\n00:01:36.349 --> 00:01:39.175\nYou may have noticed\nthat I don't have much inflection\n\n00:01:39.199 --> 00:01:40.413\nin my voice.\n\n00:01:40.437 --> 00:01:43.498\nThat's why people\noften confuse me with a GPS.\n\n00:01:43.522 --> 00:01:47.396\n(Laughter)\n\n00:01:47.992 --> 00:01:51.939\nThis can make basic communication\na challenge, unless you need directions.\n\n00:01:51.963 --> 00:01:56.378\n(Laughter)\n\n00:01:56.402 --> 00:01:57.576\nThank you.\n\n00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:01.827\n(Applause)\n\n00:02:02.558 --> 00:02:05.797\nA few years ago, when I started\ndoing presentations,\n\n00:02:05.821 --> 00:02:08.450\nI went to get head shots done\nfor the first time.\n\n00:02:09.339 --> 00:02:12.082\nThe photographer told me to look flirty.\n\n00:02:12.106 --> 00:02:14.375\n(Laughter)\n\n00:02:14.399 --> 00:02:16.988\nAnd I had no idea\nwhat she was talking about.\n\n00:02:17.012 --> 00:02:18.658\n(Laughter)\n\n00:02:18.682 --> 00:02:21.110\nShe said, \"Do that thing,\nyou know, with your eyes,\n\n00:02:21.134 --> 00:02:23.035\nwhen you're flirting with guys.\"\n\n00:02:23.059 --> 00:02:25.150\n\"What thing?\" I asked.\n\n00:02:25.566 --> 00:02:27.019\n\"You know, squint.\"\n\n00:02:27.511 --> 00:02:29.195\nAnd so I tried, really.\n\n00:02:29.219 --> 00:02:30.880\nIt looked something like this.\n\n00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:33.801\n(Laughter)\n\n00:02:33.825 --> 00:02:36.448\nI looked like I was searching for Waldo.\n\n00:02:36.472 --> 00:02:38.858\n(Laughter)\n\n00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:42.272\nThere's a reason for this,\n\n00:02:42.296 --> 00:02:44.865\nas there is a reason that Waldo is hiding.\n\n00:02:44.889 --> 00:02:49.336\n(Laughter)\n\n00:02:52.876 --> 00:02:54.464\nI have Asperger's,\n\n00:02:54.488 --> 00:02:56.480\na high-functioning form of autism\n\n00:02:56.504 --> 00:02:59.980\nthat impairs the basic social skills\none is expected to display.\n\n00:03:02.684 --> 00:03:05.768\nIt's made life difficult in many ways,\n\n00:03:05.792 --> 00:03:09.532\nand growing up,\nI struggled to fit in socially.\n\n00:03:09.913 --> 00:03:13.540\nMy friends would tell jokes,\nbut I didn't understand them.\n\n00:03:14.278 --> 00:03:18.934\nMy personal heroes were George Carlin\nand Stephen Colbert --\n\n00:03:18.958 --> 00:03:21.339\nand they taught me humor.\n\n00:03:22.839 --> 00:03:26.645\nMy personality switched\nfrom being shy and awkward\n\n00:03:26.669 --> 00:03:29.462\nto being defiant and cursing out a storm.\n\n00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:33.013\nNeedless to say,\nI did not have many friends.\n\n00:03:33.672 --> 00:03:35.950\nI was also hypersensitive to texture.\n\n00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:40.367\nThe feel of water on my skin\nwas like pins and needles,\n\n00:03:40.391 --> 00:03:42.685\nand so for years, I refused to shower.\n\n00:03:43.209 --> 00:03:47.177\nI can assure you that my hygiene routine\nis up to standards now, though.\n\n00:03:47.201 --> 00:03:48.834\n(Laughter)\n\n00:03:50.445 --> 00:03:54.838\nI had to do a lot to get here,\nand my parents --\n\n00:03:54.862 --> 00:03:59.491\nthings kind of got out of control\nwhen I was sexually assaulted by a peer,\n\n00:03:59.515 --> 00:04:04.315\nand on top of everything,\nit made a difficult situation worse.\n\n00:04:05.228 --> 00:04:10.791\nAnd I had to travel 2,000 miles\nacross the country to get treatment,\n\n00:04:10.815 --> 00:04:14.489\nbut within days of them prescribing\na new medication,\n\n00:04:14.513 --> 00:04:17.265\nmy life turned into an episode\nof the Walking Dead.\n\n00:04:18.067 --> 00:04:21.179\nI became paranoid,\nand began to hallucinate\n\n00:04:21.203 --> 00:04:24.227\nthat rotting corpses\nwere coming towards me.\n\n00:04:24.727 --> 00:04:27.569\nMy family finally rescued me,\n\n00:04:27.593 --> 00:04:32.282\nbut by that time, I had lost 19 pounds\nin those three weeks,\n\n00:04:32.306 --> 00:04:34.735\nas well as developing severe anemia,\n\n00:04:34.759 --> 00:04:36.520\nand was on the verge of suicide.\n\n00:04:38.138 --> 00:04:42.813\nI transferred to a new treatment center\nthat understood my aversions,\n\n00:04:42.837 --> 00:04:46.518\nmy trauma, and my social anxiety,\n\n00:04:46.542 --> 00:04:49.858\nand they knew how to treat it,\nand I got the help I finally needed.\n\n00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:52.732\nAnd after 18 months of hard work,\n\n00:04:52.756 --> 00:04:55.848\nI went on to do incredible things.\n\n00:04:56.668 --> 00:05:00.096\nOne of the things with Asperger's\nis that oftentimes,\n\n00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:02.213\nthese people have\na very complex inner life,\n\n00:05:02.237 --> 00:05:05.078\nand I know for myself,\nI have a very colorful personality,\n\n00:05:05.102 --> 00:05:08.806\nrich ideas, and just a lot\ngoing on in my mind.\n\n00:05:08.830 --> 00:05:12.203\nBut there's a gap\nbetween where that stands,\n\n00:05:12.227 --> 00:05:14.818\nand how I communicate it\nwith the rest of the world.\n\n00:05:15.374 --> 00:05:18.850\nAnd this can make\nbasic communication a challenge.\n\n00:05:20.064 --> 00:05:23.323\nNot many places would hire me,\ndue to my lack of social skills,\n\n00:05:23.347 --> 00:05:25.647\nwhich is why I applied to Waffle House.\n\n00:05:25.671 --> 00:05:31.258\n(Laughter)\n\n00:05:32.028 --> 00:05:35.706\nWaffle House is an exceptional\n24-hour diner --\n\n00:05:35.730 --> 00:05:37.683\n(Laughter)\n\n00:05:37.707 --> 00:05:40.961\n(Applause)\n\n00:05:40.985 --> 00:05:42.925\nthank you --\n\n00:05:42.949 --> 00:05:44.708\nwhere you can order your hash browns\n\n00:05:44.732 --> 00:05:47.885\nthe many ways that someone\nwould dispose of a human corpse ...\n\n00:05:47.909 --> 00:05:49.542\n(Laughter)\n\n00:05:49.566 --> 00:05:54.295\nSliced, diced, peppered, chunked,\ntopped, capped, and covered.\n\n00:05:54.319 --> 00:05:56.422\n(Laughter)\n\n00:05:56.446 --> 00:05:57.891\nAs social norms would have it,\n\n00:05:57.915 --> 00:06:01.412\nyou should only go to Waffle House\nat an ungodly hour in the night.\n\n00:06:01.436 --> 00:06:02.587\n(Laughter)\n\n00:06:02.611 --> 00:06:06.967\nSo one time, at 2 am, I was chatting\nwith a waitress, and I asked her,\n\n00:06:06.991 --> 00:06:10.261\n\"What's the most ridiculous thing\nthat's happened to you on the job?\"\n\n00:06:10.831 --> 00:06:14.094\nAnd she told me that one time,\na man walked in completely naked.\n\n00:06:14.118 --> 00:06:15.348\n(Laughter)\n\n00:06:15.712 --> 00:06:18.220\nI said, \"Great! Sign me up\nfor the graveyard shift!\"\n\n00:06:18.244 --> 00:06:20.848\n(Laughter)\n\n00:06:20.872 --> 00:06:23.663\nNeedless to say,\nWaffle House did not hire me.\n\n00:06:25.796 --> 00:06:30.176\nSo in terms of having Asperger's,\nit can be viewed as a disadvantage,\n\n00:06:30.200 --> 00:06:32.367\nand sometimes it is\na real pain in the butt,\n\n00:06:32.391 --> 00:06:34.145\nbut it's also the opposite.\n\n00:06:34.169 --> 00:06:37.760\nIt's a gift, and it allows me\nto think innovatively.\n\n00:06:38.768 --> 00:06:45.598\nAt 19, I won a research competition\nfor my research on coral reefs,\n\n00:06:45.622 --> 00:06:47.137\nand I ended up speaking\n\n00:06:47.161 --> 00:06:49.412\nat the UN Convention\nof Biological Diversity,\n\n00:06:49.436 --> 00:06:50.932\npresenting this research.\n\n00:06:50.956 --> 00:06:52.644\n(Applause)\n\n00:06:52.668 --> 00:06:53.826\nThank you.\n\n00:06:53.850 --> 00:06:58.748\n(Applause)\n\n00:06:58.772 --> 00:07:02.767\nAnd at 22, I'm getting ready\nto graduate college,\n\n00:07:02.791 --> 00:07:07.326\nand I am a co-founder of a biotech\ncompany called AutismSees.\n\n00:07:08.233 --> 00:07:09.241\n(Applause)\n\n00:07:09.265 --> 00:07:10.520\nThank you.\n\n00:07:10.544 --> 00:07:13.221\n(Applause)\n\n00:07:13.245 --> 00:07:16.429\nBut consider what I had to do to get here:\n\n00:07:16.453 --> 00:07:21.744\n25 therapists, 11 misdiagnoses,\nand years of pain and trauma.\n\n00:07:22.656 --> 00:07:25.727\nI spent a lot of time thinking\nif there's a better way,\n\n00:07:25.751 --> 00:07:29.803\nand I think there is:\nautism-assistive technology.\n\n00:07:30.461 --> 00:07:32.478\nThis technology\ncould play an integral role\n\n00:07:32.502 --> 00:07:35.357\nin helping people\nwith autistic spectrum disorder,\n\n00:07:35.381 --> 00:07:36.535\nor ASD.\n\n00:07:38.423 --> 00:07:43.389\nThe app Podium, released\nby my company, AutismSees,\n\n00:07:43.413 --> 00:07:48.687\nhas the ability to independently assess\nand help develop communication skills.\n\n00:07:49.282 --> 00:07:53.604\nIn addition to this, it tracks\neye contact through camera\n\n00:07:53.628 --> 00:07:59.535\nand simulates a public-speaking\nand job-interview experience.\n\n00:08:00.519 --> 00:08:03.076\nAnd so maybe one day,\nWaffle House will hire me,\n\n00:08:03.100 --> 00:08:05.280\nafter practicing on it some more.\n\n00:08:05.304 --> 00:08:06.485\n(Laughter)\n\n00:08:09.120 --> 00:08:14.639\nAnd one of the great things\nis that I've used Podium\n\n00:08:14.663 --> 00:08:19.749\nto help me prepare for today,\nand it's been a great help.\n\n00:08:19.773 --> 00:08:21.400\nBut it's more than that.\n\n00:08:21.424 --> 00:08:22.978\nThere's more that can be done.\n\n00:08:24.232 --> 00:08:27.324\nFor people with ASD --\n\n00:08:27.348 --> 00:08:31.865\nit has been speculated\nthat many innovative scientists,\n\n00:08:31.889 --> 00:08:36.480\nresearchers, artists,\nand engineers have it;\n\n00:08:36.504 --> 00:08:42.534\nlike, for example, Emily Dickinson,\nJane Austen, Isaac Newton, and Bill Gates\n\n00:08:42.558 --> 00:08:44.295\nare some examples.\n\n00:08:44.319 --> 00:08:46.072\nBut the problem that's encountered\n\n00:08:46.096 --> 00:08:49.933\nis that these brilliant ideas\noften can't be shared\n\n00:08:49.957 --> 00:08:52.221\nif there are communication roadblocks.\n\n00:08:53.207 --> 00:08:57.933\nAnd so, many people with autism\nare being overlooked every day,\n\n00:08:57.957 --> 00:08:59.767\nand they're being taken advantage of.\n\n00:09:01.133 --> 00:09:08.028\nSo my dream for people with autism\nis to change that,\n\n00:09:08.052 --> 00:09:10.979\nto remove the roadblocks\nthat prevent them from succeeding.\n\n00:09:11.766 --> 00:09:14.268\nOne of the reasons I love lucid dreaming\n\n00:09:14.292 --> 00:09:17.174\nis because it allows me to be free,\n\n00:09:17.198 --> 00:09:21.263\nwithout judgment of social\nand physical consequences.\n\n00:09:21.596 --> 00:09:24.598\nWhen I'm flying over scenes\nthat I create in my mind,\n\n00:09:24.622 --> 00:09:25.851\nI am at peace.\n\n00:09:27.304 --> 00:09:29.324\nI am free from judgment,\n\n00:09:29.348 --> 00:09:31.364\nand so I can do whatever I want, you know?\n\n00:09:31.388 --> 00:09:36.292\nI'm making out with Brad Pitt,\nand Angelina is totally cool with it.\n\n00:09:36.316 --> 00:09:38.196\n(Laughter)\n\n00:09:39.717 --> 00:09:43.616\nBut the goal of autism-assistive\ntechnology is bigger than that,\n\n00:09:43.640 --> 00:09:45.001\nand more important.\n\n00:09:45.683 --> 00:09:49.604\nMy goal is to shift people's perspective\n\n00:09:49.628 --> 00:09:54.608\nof autism and people\nwith higher-functioning Asperger's\n\n00:09:54.632 --> 00:09:58.496\nbecause there is a lot they can do.\n\n00:09:58.520 --> 00:10:01.956\nI mean, look at\nTemple Grandin, for example.\n\n00:10:01.980 --> 00:10:07.075\nAnd by doing so, we allow people\nto share their talents with this world\n\n00:10:07.099 --> 00:10:09.466\nand move this world forward.\n\n00:10:09.490 --> 00:10:12.712\nIn addition, we give them the courage\nto pursue their dreams\n\n00:10:12.736 --> 00:10:15.024\nin the real world, in real time.\n\n00:10:15.048 --> 00:10:16.207\nThank you.\n\n00:10:16.231 --> 00:10:19.879\n(Applause)\n\n00:10:19.903 --> 00:10:21.054\nThank you.\n\n00:10:21.078 --> 00:10:24.918\n(Applause)"}, {"title": "A visual history of human knowledge", "duration": "769", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/manuel_lima_a_visual_history_of_human_knowledge", "transcript": "Over the past 10 years, I've been researching the way people organize and visualize information. And I've noticed an interesting shift.For a long period of time, we believed in a natural ranking order in the world around us, also known as the great chain of being, or \"Scala naturae\" in Latin, a top-down structure that normally starts with God at the very top, followed by angels, noblemen, common people, animals, and so on. This idea was actually based on Aristotle's ontology, which classified all things known to man in a set of opposing categories, like the ones you see behind me. But over time, interestingly enough, this concept adopted the branching schema of a tree in what became known as the Porphyrian tree, also considered to be the oldest tree of knowledge.The branching scheme of the tree was, in fact, such a powerful metaphor for conveying information that it became, over time, an important communication tool to map a variety of systems of knowledge. We can see trees being used to map morality, with the popular tree of virtues and tree of vices, as you can see here, with these beautiful illustrations from medieval Europe. We can see trees being used to map consanguinity, the various blood ties between people. We can also see trees being used to map genealogy, perhaps the most famous archetype of the tree diagram. I think many of you in the audience have probably seen family trees. Many of you probably even have your own family trees drawn in such a way. We can see trees even mapping systems of law, the various decrees and rulings of kings and rulers. And finally, of course, also a very popular scientific metaphor, we can see trees being used to map all species known to man. And trees ultimately became such a powerful visual metaphor because in many ways, they really embody this human desire for order, for balance, for unity, for symmetry.However, nowadays we are really facing new complex, intricate challenges that cannot be understood by simply employing a simple tree diagram. And a new metaphor is currently emerging, and it's currently replacing the tree in visualizing various systems of knowledge. It's really providing us with a new lens to understand the world around us. And this new metaphor is the metaphor of the network. And we can see this shift from trees into networks in many domains of knowledge.We can see this shift in the way we try to understand the brain. While before, we used to think of the brain as a modular, centralized organ, where a given area was responsible for a set of actions and behaviors, the more we know about the brain, the more we think of it as a large music symphony, played by hundreds and thousands of instruments. This is a beautiful snapshot created by the Blue Brain Project, where you can see 10,000 neurons and 30 million connections. And this is only mapping 10 percent of a mammalian neocortex. We can also see this shift in the way we try to conceive of human knowledge.These are some remarkable trees of knowledge, or trees of science, by Spanish scholar Ramon Llull. And Llull was actually the precursor, the very first one who created the metaphor of science as a tree, a metaphor we use every single day, when we say, \"Biology is a branch of science,\" when we say, \"Genetics is a branch of science.\" But perhaps the most beautiful of all trees of knowledge, at least for me, was created for the French encyclopedia by Diderot and d'Alembert in 1751. This was really the bastion of the French Enlightenment, and this gorgeous illustration was featured as a table of contents for the encyclopedia. And it actually maps out all domains of knowledge as separate branches of a tree.But knowledge is much more intricate than this. These are two maps of Wikipedia showing the inter-linkage of articles \u2014 related to history on the left, and mathematics on the right. And I think by looking at these maps and other ones that have been created of Wikipedia \u2014 arguably one of the largest rhizomatic structures ever created by man \u2014 we can really understand how human knowledge is much more intricate and interdependent, just like a network.We can also see this interesting shift in the way we map social ties between people. This is the typical organization chart. I'm assuming many of you have seen a similar chart as well, in your own corporations, or others. It's a top-down structure that normally starts with the CEO at the very top, and where you can drill down all the way to the individual workmen on the bottom. But humans sometimes are, well, actually, all humans are unique in their own way, and sometimes you really don't play well under this really rigid structure.I think the Internet is really changing this paradigm quite a lot. This is a fantastic map of online social collaboration between Perl developers. Perl is a famous programming language, and here, you can see how different programmers are actually exchanging files, and working together on a given project. And here, you can notice that this is a completely decentralized process \u2014 there's no leader in this organization, it's a network.We can also see this interesting shift when we look at terrorism. One of the main challenges of understanding terrorism nowadays is that we are dealing with decentralized, independent cells, where there's no leader leading the whole process. And here, you can actually see how visualization is being used. The diagram that you see behind me shows all the terrorists involved in the Madrid attack in 2004. And what they did here is, they actually segmented the network into three different years, represented by the vertical layers that you see behind me. And the blue lines tie together the people that were present in that network year after year. So even though there's no leader per se, these people are probably the most influential ones in that organization, the ones that know more about the past, and the future plans and goals of this particular cell.We can also see this shift from trees into networks in the way we classify and organize species. The image on the right is the only illustration that Darwin included in \"The Origin of Species,\" which Darwin called the \"Tree of Life.\" There's actually a letter from Darwin to the publisher, expanding on the importance of this particular diagram. It was critical for Darwin's theory of evolution. But recently, scientists discovered that overlaying this tree of life is a dense network of bacteria, and these bacteria are actually tying together species that were completely separated before, to what scientists are now calling not the tree of life, but the web of life, the network of life.And finally, we can really see this shift, again, when we look at ecosystems around our planet. No more do we have these simplified predator-versus-prey diagrams we have all learned at school. This is a much more accurate depiction of an ecosystem. This is a diagram created by Professor David Lavigne, mapping close to 100 species that interact with the codfish off the coast of Newfoundland in Canada. And I think here, we can really understand the intricate and interdependent nature of most ecosystems that abound on our planet.But even though recent, this metaphor of the network, is really already adopting various shapes and forms, and it's almost becoming a growing visual taxonomy. It's almost becoming the syntax of a new language. And this is one aspect that truly fascinates me. And these are actually 15 different typologies I've been collecting over time, and it really shows the immense visual diversity of this new metaphor. And here is an example. On the very top band, you have radial convergence, a visualization model that has become really popular over the last five years. At the top left, the very first project is a gene network, followed by a network of IP addresses \u2014 machines, servers \u2014 followed by a network of Facebook friends. You probably couldn't find more disparate topics, yet they are using the same metaphor, the same visual model, to map the never-ending complexities of its own subject. And here are a few more examples of the many I've been collecting, of this growing visual taxonomy of networks.But networks are not just a scientific metaphor. As designers, researchers, and scientists try to map a variety of complex systems, they are in many ways influencing traditional art fields, like painting and sculpture, and influencing many different artists. And perhaps because networks have this huge aesthetical force to them \u2014 they're immensely gorgeous \u2014 they are really becoming a cultural meme, and driving a new art movement, which I've called \"networkism.\" And we can see this influence in this movement in a variety of ways. This is just one of many examples, where you can see this influence from science into art. The example on your left side is IP-mapping, a computer-generated map of IP addresses; again \u2014 servers, machines. And on your right side, you have \"Transient Structures and Unstable Networks\" by Sharon Molloy, using oil and enamel on canvas. And here are a few more paintings by Sharon Molloy, some gorgeous, intricate paintings.And here's another example of that interesting cross-pollination between science and art. On your left side, you have \"Operation Smile.\" It is a computer-generated map of a social network. And on your right side, you have \"Field 4,\" by Emma McNally, using only graphite on paper. Emma McNally is one of the main leaders of this movement, and she creates these striking, imaginary landscapes, where you can really notice the influence from traditional network visualization.But networkism doesn't happen only in two dimensions. This is perhaps one of my favorite projects of this new movement. And I think the title really says it all \u2014 it's called: \"Galaxies Forming Along Filaments, Like Droplets Along the Strands of a Spider's Web.\" And I just find this particular project to be immensely powerful. It was created by Tom\u00e1s Saraceno, and he occupies these large spaces, creates these massive installations using only elastic ropes. As you actually navigate that space and bounce along those elastic ropes, the entire network kind of shifts, almost like a real organic network would.And here's yet another example of networkism taken to a whole different level. This was created by Japanese artist Chiharu Shiota in a piece called \"In Silence.\" And Chiharu, like Tom\u00e1s Saraceno, fills these rooms with this dense network, this dense web of elastic ropes and black wool and thread, sometimes including objects, as you can see here, sometimes even including people, in many of her installations.But networks are also not just a new trend, and it's too easy for us to dismiss it as such. Networks really embody notions of decentralization, of interconnectedness, of interdependence. And this new way of thinking is critical for us to solve many of the complex problems we are facing nowadays, from decoding the human brain, to understanding the vast universe out there. On your left side, you have a snapshot of a neural network of a mouse \u2014 very similar to our own at this particular scale. And on your right side, you have the Millennium Simulation. It was the largest and most realistic simulation of the growth of cosmic structure. It was able to recreate the history of 20 million galaxies in approximately 25 terabytes of output. And coincidentally or not, I just find this particular comparison between the smallest scale of knowledge \u2014 the brain \u2014 and the largest scale of knowledge \u2014 the universe itself \u2014 to be really quite striking and fascinating. Because as Bruce Mau once said, \"When everything is connected to everything else, for better or for worse, everything matters.\"Thank you so much.(Applause)", "id": 2296, "subtitle":

visualize information.\n\n00:00:19.744 --> 00:00:21.783\nAnd I've noticed an interesting shift.\n\n00:00:22.124 --> 00:00:23.844\nFor a long period of time,\n\n00:00:23.868 --> 00:00:28.296\nwe believed in a natural ranking order\nin the world around us,\n\n00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:33.065\nalso known as the great chain of being,\nor \"Scala naturae\" in Latin,\n\n00:00:33.089 --> 00:00:37.264\na top-down structure that normally starts\nwith God at the very top,\n\n00:00:37.288 --> 00:00:39.693\nfollowed by angels, noblemen,\n\n00:00:39.717 --> 00:00:42.730\ncommon people, animals, and so on.\n\n00:00:43.957 --> 00:00:48.232\nThis idea was actually based\non Aristotle's ontology,\n\n00:00:48.256 --> 00:00:52.700\nwhich classified all things known to man\nin a set of opposing categories,\n\n00:00:52.724 --> 00:00:54.446\nlike the ones you see behind me.\n\n00:00:56.645 --> 00:00:59.392\nBut over time, interestingly enough,\n\n00:00:59.416 --> 00:01:03.562\nthis concept adopted\nthe branching schema of a tree\n\n00:01:03.586 --> 00:01:06.459\nin what became known\nas the Porphyrian tree,\n\n00:01:06.483 --> 00:01:10.125\nalso considered to be\nthe oldest tree of knowledge.\n\n00:01:11.196 --> 00:01:13.370\nThe branching scheme\nof the tree was, in fact,\n\n00:01:13.394 --> 00:01:16.343\nsuch a powerful metaphor\nfor conveying information\n\n00:01:16.367 --> 00:01:19.637\nthat it became, over time,\nan important communication tool\n\n00:01:19.661 --> 00:01:21.935\nto map a variety of systems of knowledge.\n\n00:01:22.606 --> 00:01:25.689\nWe can see trees being used\nto map morality,\n\n00:01:25.713 --> 00:01:28.562\nwith the popular tree of virtues\nand tree of vices,\n\n00:01:28.586 --> 00:01:32.378\nas you can see here, with these beautiful\nillustrations from medieval Europe.\n\n00:01:32.783 --> 00:01:35.871\nWe can see trees being used\nto map consanguinity,\n\n00:01:35.895 --> 00:01:38.139\nthe various blood ties between people.\n\n00:01:39.068 --> 00:01:42.164\nWe can also see trees being used\nto map genealogy,\n\n00:01:42.188 --> 00:01:44.998\nperhaps the most famous archetype\nof the tree diagram.\n\n00:01:45.022 --> 00:01:48.338\nI think many of you in the audience\nhave probably seen family trees.\n\n00:01:48.362 --> 00:01:52.067\nMany of you probably even have\nyour own family trees drawn in such a way.\n\n00:01:53.116 --> 00:01:56.027\nWe can see trees even mapping\nsystems of law,\n\n00:01:56.051 --> 00:01:59.902\nthe various decrees and rulings\nof kings and rulers.\n\n00:02:01.743 --> 00:02:05.501\nAnd finally, of course,\nalso a very popular scientific metaphor,\n\n00:02:05.525 --> 00:02:09.085\nwe can see trees being used\nto map all species known to man.\n\n00:02:11.135 --> 00:02:15.041\nAnd trees ultimately became\nsuch a powerful visual metaphor\n\n00:02:15.065 --> 00:02:17.933\nbecause in many ways,\nthey really embody this human desire\n\n00:02:17.957 --> 00:02:20.993\nfor order, for balance,\nfor unity, for symmetry.\n\n00:02:21.957 --> 00:02:26.280\nHowever, nowadays we are really facing\nnew complex, intricate challenges\n\n00:02:26.304 --> 00:02:30.494\nthat cannot be understood by simply\nemploying a simple tree diagram.\n\n00:02:31.995 --> 00:02:35.237\nAnd a new metaphor is currently emerging,\n\n00:02:35.261 --> 00:02:37.411\nand it's currently replacing the tree\n\n00:02:37.435 --> 00:02:39.998\nin visualizing various\nsystems of knowledge.\n\n00:02:40.022 --> 00:02:44.274\nIt's really providing us with a new lens\nto understand the world around us.\n\n00:02:45.453 --> 00:02:48.652\nAnd this new metaphor\nis the metaphor of the network.\n\n00:02:49.469 --> 00:02:52.780\nAnd we can see this shift\nfrom trees into networks\n\n00:02:52.804 --> 00:02:54.444\nin many domains of knowledge.\n\n00:02:54.468 --> 00:02:58.657\nWe can see this shift in the way\nwe try to understand the brain.\n\n00:03:00.411 --> 00:03:02.449\nWhile before, we used\nto think of the brain\n\n00:03:02.473 --> 00:03:04.464\nas a modular, centralized organ,\n\n00:03:04.488 --> 00:03:08.526\nwhere a given area was responsible\nfor a set of actions and behaviors,\n\n00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:10.289\nthe more we know about the brain,\n\n00:03:10.313 --> 00:03:13.599\nthe more we think of it\nas a large music symphony,\n\n00:03:13.623 --> 00:03:16.233\nplayed by hundreds\nand thousands of instruments.\n\n00:03:16.257 --> 00:03:19.933\nThis is a beautiful snapshot\ncreated by the Blue Brain Project,\n\n00:03:19.957 --> 00:03:24.020\nwhere you can see 10,000 neurons\nand 30 million connections.\n\n00:03:24.694 --> 00:03:28.582\nAnd this is only mapping 10 percent\nof a mammalian neocortex.\n\n00:03:30.773 --> 00:03:34.933\nWe can also see this shift in the way\nwe try to conceive of human knowledge.\n\n00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:39.168\nThese are some remarkable trees\nof knowledge, or trees of science,\n\n00:03:39.192 --> 00:03:41.413\nby Spanish scholar Ramon Llull.\n\n00:03:41.957 --> 00:03:43.767\nAnd Llull was actually the precursor,\n\n00:03:43.791 --> 00:03:47.505\nthe very first one who created\nthe metaphor of science as a tree,\n\n00:03:47.529 --> 00:03:50.497\na metaphor we use\nevery single day, when we say,\n\n00:03:50.521 --> 00:03:52.186\n\"Biology is a branch of science,\"\n\n00:03:52.210 --> 00:03:53.363\nwhen we say,\n\n00:03:53.387 --> 00:03:55.320\n\"Genetics is a branch of science.\"\n\n00:03:56.241 --> 00:03:59.836\nBut perhaps the most beautiful of all\ntrees of knowledge, at least for me,\n\n00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:04.312\nwas created for the French encyclopedia\nby Diderot and d'Alembert in 1751.\n\n00:04:04.336 --> 00:04:06.971\nThis was really the bastion\nof the French Enlightenment,\n\n00:04:06.995 --> 00:04:10.820\nand this gorgeous illustration\nwas featured as a table of contents\n\n00:04:10.844 --> 00:04:12.415\nfor the encyclopedia.\n\n00:04:12.439 --> 00:04:16.626\nAnd it actually maps out\nall domains of knowledge\n\n00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:18.768\nas separate branches of a tree.\n\n00:04:19.824 --> 00:04:22.157\nBut knowledge is much more\nintricate than this.\n\n00:04:22.752 --> 00:04:27.392\nThese are two maps of Wikipedia\nshowing the inter-linkage of articles --\n\n00:04:27.416 --> 00:04:31.306\nrelated to history on the left,\nand mathematics on the right.\n\n00:04:31.924 --> 00:04:33.663\nAnd I think by looking at these maps\n\n00:04:33.687 --> 00:04:36.231\nand other ones that have been\ncreated of Wikipedia --\n\n00:04:36.255 --> 00:04:39.647\narguably one of the largest rhizomatic\nstructures ever created by man --\n\n00:04:39.671 --> 00:04:43.493\nwe can really understand\nhow human knowledge is much more intricate\n\n00:04:43.517 --> 00:04:45.953\nand interdependent, just like a network.\n\n00:04:47.413 --> 00:04:49.576\nWe can also see this interesting shift\n\n00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:52.300\nin the way we map\nsocial ties between people.\n\n00:04:53.482 --> 00:04:55.777\nThis is the typical organization chart.\n\n00:04:55.801 --> 00:04:58.595\nI'm assuming many of you have seen\na similar chart as well,\n\n00:04:58.619 --> 00:05:00.365\nin your own corporations, or others.\n\n00:05:00.389 --> 00:05:01.874\nIt's a top-down structure\n\n00:05:01.898 --> 00:05:04.759\nthat normally starts\nwith the CEO at the very top,\n\n00:05:04.783 --> 00:05:08.743\nand where you can drill down all the

organization,\n\n00:05:43.937 --> 00:05:45.094\nit's a network.\n\n00:05:46.295 --> 00:05:51.000\nWe can also see this interesting shift\nwhen we look at terrorism.\n\n00:05:51.571 --> 00:05:54.675\nOne of the main challenges\nof understanding terrorism nowadays\n\n00:05:54.699 --> 00:05:58.429\nis that we are dealing with\ndecentralized, independent cells,\n\n00:05:58.453 --> 00:06:01.275\nwhere there's no leader\nleading the whole process.\n\n00:06:02.476 --> 00:06:05.774\nAnd here, you can actually see\nhow visualization is being used.\n\n00:06:05.798 --> 00:06:07.455\nThe diagram that you see behind me\n\n00:06:07.479 --> 00:06:11.297\nshows all the terrorists involved\nin the Madrid attack in 2004.\n\n00:06:11.900 --> 00:06:14.827\nAnd what they did here is,\nthey actually segmented the network\n\n00:06:14.851 --> 00:06:16.350\ninto three different years,\n\n00:06:16.374 --> 00:06:19.416\nrepresented by the vertical layers\nthat you see behind me.\n\n00:06:19.440 --> 00:06:21.409\nAnd the blue lines tie together\n\n00:06:21.433 --> 00:06:25.051\nthe people that were present\nin that network year after year.\n\n00:06:25.075 --> 00:06:27.103\nSo even though there's no leader per se,\n\n00:06:27.127 --> 00:06:30.762\nthese people are probably the most\ninfluential ones in that organization,\n\n00:06:30.786 --> 00:06:32.794\nthe ones that know more about the past,\n\n00:06:32.818 --> 00:06:35.695\nand the future plans and goals\nof this particular cell.\n\n00:06:37.190 --> 00:06:40.196\nWe can also see this shift\nfrom trees into networks\n\n00:06:40.220 --> 00:06:43.211\nin the way we classify\nand organize species.\n\n00:06:45.203 --> 00:06:48.032\nThe image on the right\nis the only illustration\n\n00:06:48.056 --> 00:06:51.168\nthat Darwin included\nin \"The Origin of Species,\"\n\n00:06:51.192 --> 00:06:53.453\nwhich Darwin called the \"Tree of Life.\"\n\n00:06:54.056 --> 00:06:56.941\nThere's actually a letter\nfrom Darwin to the publisher,\n\n00:06:56.965 --> 00:06:59.621\nexpanding on the importance\nof this particular diagram.\n\n00:06:59.645 --> 00:07:02.287\nIt was critical for Darwin's\ntheory of evolution.\n\n00:07:03.366 --> 00:07:06.933\nBut recently, scientists discovered\nthat overlaying this tree of life\n\n00:07:06.957 --> 00:07:09.392\nis a dense network of bacteria,\n\n00:07:09.416 --> 00:07:11.577\nand these bacteria\nare actually tying together\n\n00:07:11.601 --> 00:07:13.773\nspecies that were completely\nseparated before,\n\n00:07:13.797 --> 00:07:16.877\nto what scientists are now calling\nnot the tree of life,\n\n00:07:16.901 --> 00:07:19.757\nbut the web of life, the network of life.\n\n00:07:21.447 --> 00:07:23.961\nAnd finally, we can really\nsee this shift, again,\n\n00:07:23.985 --> 00:07:26.409\nwhen we look at ecosystems\naround our planet.\n\n00:07:27.557 --> 00:07:30.723\nNo more do we have these simplified\npredator-versus-prey diagrams\n\n00:07:30.747 --> 00:07:32.194\nwe have all learned at school.\n\n00:07:33.159 --> 00:07:36.148\nThis is a much more accurate\ndepiction of an ecosystem.\n\n00:07:36.172 --> 00:07:39.076\nThis is a diagram created\nby Professor David Lavigne,\n\n00:07:39.100 --> 00:07:42.600\nmapping close to 100 species\nthat interact with the codfish\n\n00:07:42.624 --> 00:07:45.575\noff the coast of Newfoundland in Canada.\n\n00:07:46.202 --> 00:07:50.139\nAnd I think here, we can really understand\nthe intricate and interdependent nature\n\n00:07:50.163 --> 00:07:52.686\nof most ecosystems\nthat abound on our planet.\n\n00:07:54.400 --> 00:07:58.044\nBut even though recent,\nthis metaphor of the network,\n\n00:07:58.068 --> 00:08:01.171\nis really already adopting\nvarious shapes and forms,\n\n00:08:01.195 --> 00:08:03.658\nand it's almost becoming\na growing visual taxonomy.\n\n00:08:03.682 --> 00:08:06.329\nIt's almost

typologies\n\n00:08:12.193 --> 00:08:14.328\nI've been collecting over time,\n\n00:08:14.352 --> 00:08:18.374\nand it really shows the immense\nvisual diversity of this new metaphor.\n\n00:08:18.959 --> 00:08:20.181\nAnd here is an example.\n\n00:08:20.776 --> 00:08:24.709\nOn the very top band,\nyou have radial convergence,\n\n00:08:24.733 --> 00:08:28.672\na visualization model that has become\nreally popular over the last five years.\n\n00:08:29.156 --> 00:08:33.510\nAt the top left, the very first project\nis a gene network,\n\n00:08:33.534 --> 00:08:37.543\nfollowed by a network\nof IP addresses -- machines, servers --\n\n00:08:37.567 --> 00:08:40.539\nfollowed by a network of Facebook friends.\n\n00:08:41.198 --> 00:08:43.706\nYou probably couldn't find\nmore disparate topics,\n\n00:08:43.730 --> 00:08:47.524\nyet they are using the same metaphor,\nthe same visual model,\n\n00:08:47.548 --> 00:08:51.154\nto map the never-ending complexities\nof its own subject.\n\n00:08:52.503 --> 00:08:55.627\nAnd here are a few more examples\nof the many I've been collecting,\n\n00:08:55.651 --> 00:08:58.389\nof this growing visual\ntaxonomy of networks.\n\n00:09:00.206 --> 00:09:03.071\nBut networks are not just\na scientific metaphor.\n\n00:09:04.150 --> 00:09:09.691\nAs designers, researchers, and scientists\ntry to map a variety of complex systems,\n\n00:09:09.715 --> 00:09:12.528\nthey are in many ways influencing\ntraditional art fields,\n\n00:09:12.552 --> 00:09:13.954\nlike painting and sculpture,\n\n00:09:13.978 --> 00:09:15.971\nand influencing many different artists.\n\n00:09:16.676 --> 00:09:20.718\nAnd perhaps because networks have\nthis huge aesthetical force to them --\n\n00:09:20.742 --> 00:09:22.700\nthey're immensely gorgeous --\n\n00:09:22.724 --> 00:09:24.780\nthey are really becoming a cultural meme,\n\n00:09:24.804 --> 00:09:29.129\nand driving a new art movement,\nwhich I've called \"networkism.\"\n\n00:09:30.502 --> 00:09:33.710\nAnd we can see this influence\nin this movement in a variety of ways.\n\n00:09:33.734 --> 00:09:35.527\nThis is just one of many examples,\n\n00:09:35.551 --> 00:09:38.276\nwhere you can see this influence\nfrom science into art.\n\n00:09:38.300 --> 00:09:41.171\nThe example on your left side\nis IP-mapping,\n\n00:09:41.195 --> 00:09:44.854\na computer-generated map of IP addresses;\nagain -- servers, machines.\n\n00:09:45.211 --> 00:09:46.416\nAnd on your right side,\n\n00:09:46.440 --> 00:09:51.058\nyou have \"Transient

Molloy,\n\n00:09:56.957 --> 00:09:58.889\nsome gorgeous, intricate paintings.\n\n00:10:00.333 --> 00:10:03.639\nAnd here's another example\nof that interesting cross-pollination\n\n00:10:03.663 --> 00:10:05.067\nbetween science and art.\n\n00:10:05.433 --> 00:10:08.098\nOn your left side,\nyou have \"Operation Smile.\"\n\n00:10:08.122 --> 00:10:11.011\nIt is a computer-generated map\nof a social

00:10:20.849\nEmma McNally is one of the main\nleaders of this movement,\n\n00:10:20.873 --> 00:10:23.442\nand she creates these striking,\nimaginary landscapes,\n\n00:10:23.466 --> 00:10:28.131\nwhere you can really notice the influence\nfrom traditional network visualization.\n\n00:10:30.282 --> 00:10:33.289\nBut networkism doesn't happen\nonly in two dimensions.\n\n00:10:33.313 --> 00:10:35.591\nThis is perhaps\none of my favorite projects\n\n00:10:35.615 --> 00:10:37.020\nof this new movement.\n\n00:10:37.044 --> 00:10:39.678\nAnd I think the title really\nsays it all -- it's called:\n\n00:10:39.702 --> 00:10:41.869\n\"Galaxies Forming Along Filaments,\n\n00:10:41.893 --> 00:10:45.225\nLike Droplets Along the Strands\nof a Spider's Web.\"\n\n00:10:46.574 --> 00:10:49.654\nAnd I just find this particular project\nto be immensely powerful.\n\n00:10:49.678 --> 00:10:51.638\nIt was created by Tom\u00e1s Saraceno,\n\n00:10:51.662 --> 00:10:54.360\nand he occupies these large spaces,\n\n00:10:54.384 --> 00:10:57.726\ncreates these massive installations\nusing only elastic ropes.\n\n00:10:57.750 --> 00:11:01.567\nAs you actually navigate that space\nand bounce along those elastic ropes,\n\n00:11:01.591 --> 00:11:06.166\nthe entire network kind of shifts,\nalmost like a real organic network would.\n\n00:11:07.372 --> 00:11:09.404\nAnd here's yet another example\n\n00:11:09.428 --> 00:11:11.817\nof networkism taken\nto a whole different level.\n\n00:11:12.261 --> 00:11:15.474\nThis was created\nby Japanese artist Chiharu Shiota\n\n00:11:15.498 --> 00:11:17.253\nin a piece called \"In Silence.\"\n\n00:11:17.792 --> 00:11:23.147\nAnd Chiharu, like Tom\u00e1s Saraceno,\nfills these rooms with this dense network,\n\n00:11:23.171 --> 00:11:26.933\nthis dense web of elastic ropes\nand black wool and thread,\n\n00:11:26.957 --> 00:11:29.716\nsometimes including objects,\nas you can see

--> 00:11:40.411\nand it's too easy for us\nto dismiss it as such.\n\n00:11:40.987 --> 00:11:44.594\nNetworks really embody\nnotions of decentralization,\n\n00:11:44.618 --> 00:11:47.752\nof interconnectedness, of interdependence.\n\n00:11:48.261 --> 00:11:50.737\nAnd this new way of thinking is critical\n\n00:11:50.761 --> 00:11:54.491\nfor us to solve many of the complex\nproblems we are facing nowadays,\n\n00:11:54.515 --> 00:11:56.356\nfrom decoding the human brain,\n\n00:11:56.380 --> 00:11:58.783\nto understanding\nthe vast universe out there.\n\n00:11:59.704 -->

Yes, really", "duration": "815", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/tony_wyss_coray_how_young_blood_might_help_reverse_aging_yes_really", "transcript": "This is a painting from the 16th century from Lucas Cranach the Elder. It shows the famous Fountain of Youth. If you drink its water or you bathe in it, you will get health and youth. Every culture, every civilization has dreamed of finding eternal youth. There are people like Alexander the Great or Ponce De Le\u00f3n, the explorer, who spent much of their life chasing the Fountain of Youth. They didn't find it. But what if there was something to it? What if there was something to this Fountain of Youth?I will share an absolutely amazing development in aging research that could revolutionize the way we think about aging and how we may treat age-related diseases in the future. It started with experiments that showed, in a recent number of studies about growing, that animals \u2014 old mice \u2014 that share a blood supply with young mice can get rejuvenated. This is similar to what you might see in humans, in Siamese twins, and I know this sounds a bit creepy. But what Tom Rando, a stem-cell researcher, reported in 2007, was that old muscle from a mouse can be rejuvenated if it's exposed to young blood through common circulation. This was reproduced by Amy Wagers at Harvard a few years later, and others then showed that similar rejuvenating effects could be observed in the pancreas, the liver and the heart. But what I'm most excited about, and several other labs as well, is that this may even apply to the brain.So, what we found is that an old mouse exposed to a young environment in this model called parabiosis, shows a younger brain \u2014 and a brain that functions better. And I repeat: an old mouse that gets young blood through shared circulation looks younger and functions younger in its brain. So when we get older \u2014 we can look at different aspects of human cognition, and you can see on this slide here, we can look at reasoning, verbal ability and so forth. And up to around age 50 or 60, these functions are all intact, and as I look at the young audience here in the room, we're all still fine.(Laughter)But it's scary to see how all these curves go south. And as we get older, diseases such as Alzheimer's and others may develop. We know that with age, the connections between neurons \u2014 the way neurons talk to each other, the synapses \u2014 they start to deteriorate; neurons die, the brain starts to shrink, and there's an increased susceptibility for these neurodegenerative diseases.One big problem we have \u2014 to try to understand how this really works at a very molecular mechanistic level \u2014 is that we can't study the brains in detail, in living people. We can do cognitive tests, we can do imaging \u2014 all kinds of sophisticated testing. But we usually have to wait until the person dies to get the brain and look at how it really changed through age or in a disease. This is what neuropathologists do, for example. So, how about we think of the brain as being part of the larger organism. Could we potentially understand more about what happens in the brain at the molecular level if we see the brain as part of the entire body? So if the body ages or gets sick, does that affect the brain? And vice versa: as the brain gets older, does that influence the rest of the body? And what connects all the different tissues in the body is blood. Blood is the tissue that not only carries cells that transport oxygen, for example, the red blood cells, or fights infectious diseases, but it also carries messenger molecules, hormone-like factors that transport information from one cell to another, from one tissue to another, including the brain. So if we look at how the blood changes in disease or age, can we learn something about the brain? We know that as we get older, the blood changes as well, so these hormone-like factors change as we get older. And by and large, factors that we know are required for the development of tissues, for the maintenance of tissues \u2014 they start to decrease as we get older, while factors involved in repair, in injury and in inflammation \u2014 they increase as we get older.So there's this unbalance of good and bad factors, if you will. And to illustrate what we can do potentially with that, I want to talk you through an experiment that we did. We had almost 300 blood samples from healthy human beings 20 to 89 years of age, and we measured over 100 of these communication factors, these hormone-like proteins that transport information between tissues. And what we noticed first is that between the youngest and the oldest group, about half the factors changed significantly. So our body lives in a very different environment as we get older, when it comes to these factors. And using statistical or bioinformatics programs, we could try to discover those factors that best predict age \u2014 in a way, back-calculate the relative age of a person. And the way this looks is shown in this graph. So, on the one axis you see the actual age a person lived, the chronological age. So, how many years they lived.And then we take these top factors that I showed you, and we calculate their relative age, their biological age. And what you see is that there is a pretty good correlation, so we can pretty well predict the relative age of a person. But what's really exciting are the outliers, as they so often are in life. You can see here, the person I highlighted with the green dot is about 70 years of age but seems to have a biological age, if what we're doing here is really true, of only about 45. So is this a person that actually looks much younger than their age? But more importantly: Is this a person who is maybe at a reduced risk to develop an age-related disease and will have a long life \u2014 will live to 100 or more? On the other hand, the person here, highlighted with the red dot, is not even 40, but has a biological age of 65. Is this a person at an increased risk of developing an age-related disease? So in our lab, we're trying to understand these factors better, and many other groups are trying to understand, what are the true aging factors, and can we learn something about them to possibly predict age-related diseases?So what I've shown you so far is simply correlational, right? You can just say, \"Well, these factors change with age,\" but you don't really know if they do something about aging. So what I'm going to show you now is very remarkable and it suggests that these factors can actually modulate the age of a tissue. And that's where we come back to this model called parabiosis.So, parabiosis is done in mice by surgically connecting the two mice together, and that leads then to a shared blood system, where we can now ask, \"How does the old brain get influenced by exposure to the young blood?\" And for this purpose, we use young mice that are an equivalency of 20-year-old people, and old mice that are roughly 65 years old in human years.What we found is quite remarkable. We find there are more neural stem cells that make new neurons in these old brains. There's an increased activity of the synapses, the connections between neurons. There are more genes expressed that are known to be involved in the formation of new memories. And there's less of this bad inflammation. But we observed that there are no cells entering the brains of these animals. So when we connect them, there are actually no cells going into the old brain, in this model. Instead, we've reasoned, then, that it must be the soluble factors, so we could collect simply the soluble fraction of blood which is called plasma, and inject either young plasma or old plasma into these mice, and we could reproduce these rejuvenating effects, but what we could also do now is we could do memory tests with mice.As mice get older, like us humans, they have memory problems. It's just harder to detect them, but I'll show you in a minute how we do that. But we wanted to take this one step further, one step closer to potentially being relevant to humans. What I'm showing you now are unpublished studies, where we used human plasma, young human plasma, and as a control, saline, and injected it into old mice, and asked, can we again rejuvenate these old mice? Can we make them smarter?And to do this, we used a test. It's called a Barnes maze. This is a big table that has lots of holes in it, and there are guide marks around it, and there's a bright light, as on this stage here. The mice hate this and they try to escape, and find the single hole that you see pointed at with an arrow, where a tube is mounted underneath where they can escape and feel comfortable in a dark hole. So we teach them, over several days, to find this space on these cues in the space, and you can compare this for humans, to finding your car in a parking lot after a busy day of shopping.(Laughter)Many of us have probably had some problems with that.So, let's look at an old mouse here. This is an old mouse that has memory problems, as you'll notice in a moment. It just looks into every hole, but it didn't form this spacial map that would remind it where it was in the previous trial or the last day. In stark contrast, this mouse here is a sibling of the same age, but it was treated with young human plasma for three weeks, with small injections every three days. And as you noticed, it almost looks around, \"Where am I?\" \u2014 and then walks straight to that hole and escapes. So, it could remember where that hole was.So by all means, this old mouse seems to be rejuvenated \u2014 it functions more like a younger mouse. And it also suggests that there is something not only in young mouse plasma, but in young human plasma that has the capacity to help this old brain. So to summarize, we find the old mouse, and its brain in particular, are malleable. They're not set in stone; we can actually change them. It can be rejuvenated. Young blood factors can reverse aging, and what I didn't show you \u2014 in this model, the young mouse actually suffers from exposure to the old. So there are old-blood factors that can accelerate aging. And most importantly, humans may have similar factors, because we can take young human blood and have a similar effect. Old human blood, I didn't show you, does not have this effect; it does not make the mice younger.So, is this magic transferable to humans? We're running a small clinical study at Stanford, where we treat Alzheimer's patients with mild disease with a pint of plasma from young volunteers, 20-year-olds, and do this once a week for four weeks, and then we look at their brains with imaging. We test them cognitively, and we ask their caregivers for daily activities of living. What we hope is that there are some signs of improvement from this treatment. And if that's the case, that could give us hope that what I showed you works in mice might also work in humans.Now, I don't think we will live forever. But maybe we discovered that the Fountain of Youth is actually within us, and it has just dried out. And if we can turn it back on a little bit, maybe we can find the factors that are mediating these effects, we can produce these factors synthetically and we can treat diseases of aging, such as Alzheimer's disease or other dementias.Thank you very much.(Applause)", "id": 2315, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:13.092 --> 00:00:17.751\nThis is a

00:02:30.184\nwe can look at different aspects\nof human cognition,\n\n00:02:30.208 --> 00:02:31.961\nand you can see on this slide here,\n\n00:02:31.985 --> 00:02:35.368\nwe can look at reasoning,\nverbal ability and so forth.\n\n00:02:35.857 --> 00:02:41.136\nAnd up to around age 50 or 60,\nthese functions are all intact,\n\n00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:45.642\nand as I look at the young audience\nhere in the room, we're all still fine.\n\n00:02:45.666 --> 00:02:46.674\n(Laughter)\n\n00:02:46.698 --> 00:02:50.505\nBut it's scary to see\nhow all these curves go south.\n\n00:02:50.529 --> 00:02:52.118\nAnd as we get older,\n\n00:02:52.142 --> 00:02:56.193\ndiseases such as Alzheimer's\nand others may develop.\n\n00:02:56.962 --> 00:03:00.533\nWe know that with age,\nthe connections between neurons --\n\n00:03:00.557 --> 00:03:05.208\nthe way neurons talk to each other,\nthe synapses -- they start to deteriorate;\n\n00:03:05.232 --> 00:03:08.538\nneurons die, the brain starts to shrink,\n\n00:03:08.562 --> 00:03:12.554\nand there's an increased susceptibility\nfor these neurodegenerative diseases.\n\n00:03:13.531 --> 00:03:18.440\nOne big problem we have -- to try\nto understand how this really works\n\n00:03:18.464 --> 00:03:21.060\nat a very molecular mechanistic level --\n\n00:03:21.084 --> 00:03:25.134\nis that we can't study the brains\nin detail, in living people.\n\n00:03:25.991 --> 00:03:28.977\nWe can do cognitive tests,\nwe can do imaging --\n\n00:03:29.001 --> 00:03:31.697\nall kinds of sophisticated testing.\n\n00:03:31.721 --> 00:03:35.339\nBut we usually have to wait\nuntil the person dies\n\n00:03:35.363 --> 00:03:40.457\nto get the brain and look at how it really\nchanged through age or in a disease.\n\n00:03:40.846 --> 00:03:43.910\nThis is what neuropathologists\ndo, for example.\n\n00:03:44.291 --> 00:03:49.958\nSo, how about we think of the brain\nas being part of the larger organism.\n\n00:03:49.982 --> 00:03:52.459\nCould we potentially understand more\n\n00:03:52.483 --> 00:03:55.412\nabout what happens in the brain\nat the molecular level\n\n00:03:55.436 --> 00:03:59.022\nif we see the brain\nas part of the entire body?\n\n00:03:59.046 --> 00:04:03.923\nSo if the body ages or gets sick,\ndoes that affect the brain?\n\n00:04:03.947 --> 00:04:08.370\nAnd vice versa: as the brain gets older,\ndoes that influence the rest of the body?\n\n00:04:09.008 --> 00:04:12.499\nAnd what connects all the different\ntissues in the body\n\n00:04:12.523 --> 00:04:13.673\nis blood.\n\n00:04:14.324 --> 00:04:20.149\nBlood is the tissue that not only carries\ncells that transport oxygen, for example,\n\n00:04:20.173 --> 00:04:21.414\nthe red blood cells,\n\n00:04:21.438 --> 00:04:23.638\nor fights infectious diseases,\n\n00:04:23.662 --> 00:04:27.933\nbut it also carries messenger molecules,\n\n00:04:27.957 --> 00:04:31.869\nhormone-like factors\nthat transport information\n\n00:04:31.893 --> 00:04:36.026\nfrom one cell to another,\nfrom one tissue to another,\n\n00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:37.507\nincluding the brain.\n\n00:04:37.531 --> 00:04:42.669\nSo if we look at how the blood\nchanges in disease or age,\n\n00:04:42.693 --> 00:04:45.056\ncan we learn something about the brain?\n\n00:04:45.609 --> 00:04:50.445\nWe know that as we get older,\nthe blood changes as well,\n\n00:04:50.469 --> 00:04:53.428\nso these hormone-like factors\nchange as we get older.\n\n00:04:53.452 --> 00:04:57.651\nAnd by and large,\nfactors that we know are required\n\n00:04:57.675 --> 00:05:01.096\nfor the development of tissues,\nfor the maintenance of tissues --\n\n00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:03.997\nthey start to decrease as we get older,\n\n00:05:04.021 --> 00:05:08.724\nwhile factors involved in repair,\nin injury and in inflammation --\n\n00:05:08.748 --> 00:05:10.698\nthey increase as we get older.\n\n00:05:10.722 --> 00:05:15.764\nSo there's this unbalance of good\nand bad factors, if you will.\n\n00:05:16.946 --> 00:05:19.939\nAnd to illustrate what we can do\npotentially with that,\n\n00:05:19.963 --> 00:05:22.615\nI want to talk you through\nan experiment that we did.\n\n00:05:22.639 --> 00:05:26.288\nWe had almost 300 blood samples\nfrom healthy human beings\n\n00:05:26.312 --> 00:05:28.829\n20 to 89 years of age,\n\n00:05:28.853 --> 00:05:32.748\nand we measured over 100\nof these communication factors,\n\n00:05:32.772 --> 00:05:36.866\nthese hormone-like proteins that\ntransport information between tissues.\n\n00:05:37.224 --> 00:05:38.900\nAnd what we noticed first\n\n00:05:38.924 --> 00:05:41.741\nis that between the youngest\nand the oldest group,\n\n00:05:41.765 --> 00:05:45.062\nabout half the factors\nchanged significantly.\n\n00:05:45.086 --> 00:05:48.221\nSo our body lives in a very\ndifferent environment as we get older,\n\n00:05:48.245 --> 00:05:49.996\nwhen it comes to these factors.\n\n00:05:50.020 --> 00:05:53.516\nAnd using statistical\nor bioinformatics programs,\n\n00:05:53.540 --> 00:05:58.234\nwe could try to discover\nthose factors that best predict age --\n\n00:05:58.258 --> 00:06:01.901\nin a way, back-calculate\nthe relative age of a person.\n\n00:06:02.295 --> 00:06:05.151\nAnd the way this looks\nis shown in this graph.\n\n00:06:05.576 --> 00:06:10.945\nSo, on the one axis you see\nthe actual age a person lived,\n\n00:06:10.969 --> 00:06:12.274\nthe chronological age.\n\n00:06:12.298 --> 00:06:14.020\nSo, how many years they lived.\n\n00:06:14.044 --> 00:06:16.752\nAnd then we take these top factors\nthat I showed you,\n\n00:06:16.776 --> 00:06:21.620\nand we calculate their relative age,\ntheir biological age.\n\n00:06:22.666 --> 00:06:26.300\nAnd what you see is that\nthere is a pretty good correlation,\n\n00:06:26.324 --> 00:06:29.639\nso we can pretty well predict\nthe relative age of a person.\n\n00:06:29.663 --> 00:06:33.578\nBut what's really exciting\nare the outliers,\n\n00:06:33.602 --> 00:06:35.406\nas they so often are in life.\n\n00:06:35.880 --> 00:06:40.448\nYou can see here, the person\nI highlighted with the green dot\n\n00:06:40.472 --> 00:06:43.068\nis about 70 years of age\n\n00:06:43.092 --> 00:06:48.098\nbut seems to have a biological age,\nif what we're doing here is really true,\n\n00:06:48.122 --> 00:06:50.165\nof only about 45.\n\n00:06:50.189 --> 00:06:53.673\nSo is this a person that actually\nlooks much younger than their age?\n\n00:06:54.141 --> 00:06:58.657\nBut more importantly: Is this a person\nwho is maybe at a reduced risk\n\n00:06:58.681 --> 00:07:02.005\nto develop an age-related disease\nand will have a long life --\n\n00:07:02.029 --> 00:07:03.524\nwill live to 100 or more?\n\n00:07:04.360 --> 00:07:08.921\nOn the other hand, the person here,\nhighlighted with the red dot,\n\n00:07:08.945 --> 00:07:13.851\nis not even 40,\nbut has a biological age of 65.\n\n00:07:13.875 --> 00:07:18.273\nIs this a person at an increased risk\nof developing an age-related disease?\n\n00:07:18.297 --> 00:07:21.953\nSo in our lab, we're trying\nto understand these factors better,\n\n00:07:21.977 --> 00:07:24.215\nand many other groups\nare trying to understand,\n\n00:07:24.239 --> 00:07:26.315\nwhat are the true aging factors,\n\n00:07:26.339 --> 00:07:31.312\nand can we learn something about them\nto possibly predict age-related diseases?\n\n00:07:32.239 --> 00:07:36.301\nSo what I've shown you so far\nis simply correlational, right?\n\n00:07:36.325 --> 00:07:40.356\nYou can just say,\n\"Well, these factors change with age,\"\n\n00:07:40.380 --> 00:07:44.035\nbut you don't really know\nif they do something about aging.\n\n00:07:44.989 --> 00:07:48.037\nSo what I'm going to show you now\nis very remarkable\n\n00:07:48.061 --> 00:07:53.132\nand it suggests that these factors\ncan actually modulate the age of a tissue.\n\n00:07:53.803 --> 00:07:57.101\nAnd that's where we come back\nto this model called parabiosis.\n\n00:07:57.125 --> 00:07:59.665\nSo, parabiosis is done in mice\n\n00:07:59.689 --> 00:08:04.601\nby surgically connecting\nthe two mice together,\n\n00:08:04.625 --> 00:08:06.958\nand that leads then\nto a shared blood system,\n\n00:08:06.982 --> 00:08:11.769\nwhere we can now ask,\n\"How does the old brain get influenced\n\n00:08:11.793 --> 00:08:13.531\nby exposure to the young blood?\"\n\n00:08:14.102 --> 00:08:16.306\nAnd for this purpose, we use young mice\n\n00:08:16.330 --> 00:08:19.783\nthat are an equivalency\nof 20-year-old people,\n\n00:08:19.807 --> 00:08:24.143\nand old mice that are roughly\n65 years old in human years.\n\n00:08:24.916 --> 00:08:27.742\nWhat we found is quite remarkable.\n\n00:08:27.766 --> 00:08:31.486\nWe find there are more neural stem cells\nthat make new neurons\n\n00:08:31.510 --> 00:08:32.842\nin these old brains.\n\n00:08:33.309 --> 00:08:35.891\nThere's an increased\nactivity of the synapses,\n\n00:08:35.915 --> 00:08:37.954\nthe connections between neurons.\n\n00:08:37.978 --> 00:08:41.263\nThere are more genes expressed\nthat are known to be involved\n\n00:08:41.287 --> 00:08:43.034\nin the formation of new memories.\n\n00:08:43.617 --> 00:08:46.125\nAnd there's less of this bad inflammation.\n\n00:08:47.385 --> 00:08:53.881\nBut we observed that there are no cells\nentering the brains of these animals.\n\n00:08:53.905 --> 00:08:55.291\nSo when we connect them,\n\n00:08:55.315 --> 00:09:00.691\nthere are actually no cells\ngoing into the old brain, in this model.\n\n00:09:01.337 --> 00:09:04.998\nInstead, we've reasoned, then,\nthat it must be the soluble factors,\n\n00:09:05.022 --> 00:09:09.805\nso we could collect simply the soluble\nfraction of blood which is called plasma,\n\n00:09:09.829 --> 00:09:13.773\nand inject either young plasma\nor old plasma into these mice,\n\n00:09:13.797 --> 00:09:16.165\nand we could reproduce\nthese rejuvenating effects,\n\n00:09:16.189 --> 00:09:17.903\nbut what we could also do now\n\n00:09:17.927 --> 00:09:20.377\nis we could do memory tests with mice.\n\n00:09:20.401 --> 00:09:24.254\nAs mice get older, like us humans,\nthey have memory problems.\n\n00:09:24.776 --> 00:09:26.369\nIt's just harder to detect them,\n\n00:09:26.393 --> 00:09:28.737\nbut I'll show you in a minute\nhow we do that.\n\n00:09:28.761 --> 00:09:31.456\nBut we wanted to take this\none step further,\n\n00:09:31.480 --> 00:09:35.520\none step closer to potentially\nbeing relevant to humans.\n\n00:09:35.544 --> 00:09:38.741\nWhat I'm showing you now\nare unpublished studies,\n\n00:09:38.765 --> 00:09:43.298\nwhere we used human plasma,\nyoung human plasma,\n\n00:09:43.322 --> 00:09:45.171\nand as a control, saline,\n\n00:09:45.195 --> 00:09:47.071\nand injected it into old mice,\n\n00:09:47.095 --> 00:09:51.947\nand asked, can we again\nrejuvenate these old mice?\n\n00:09:51.971 --> 00:09:53.631\nCan we make them smarter?\n\n00:09:54.062 --> 00:09:57.351\nAnd to do this, we used a test.\nIt's called a Barnes maze.\n\n00:09:57.375 --> 00:10:00.530\nThis is a big table\nthat has lots of holes in it,\n\n00:10:00.554 --> 00:10:04.037\nand there are guide marks around it,\n\n00:10:04.061 --> 00:10:06.667\nand there's a bright light,\nas on this stage here.\n\n00:10:06.691 --> 00:10:09.824\nThe mice hate this and they try to escape,\n\n00:10:09.848 --> 00:10:14.104\nand find the single hole that you see\npointed at with an arrow,\n\n00:10:14.128 --> 00:10:16.073\nwhere a tube is mounted underneath\n\n00:10:16.097 --> 00:10:19.290\nwhere they can escape\nand feel comfortable in a dark hole.\n\n00:10:19.935 --> 00:10:21.737\nSo we teach them, over several days,\n\n00:10:21.761 --> 00:10:24.664\nto find this space\non these cues in the space,\n\n00:10:24.688 --> 00:10:27.482\nand you can compare this for humans,\n\n00:10:27.506 --> 00:10:31.736\nto finding your car in a parking lot\nafter a busy day of shopping.\n\n00:10:31.760 --> 00:10:32.761\n(Laughter)\n\n00:10:32.785 --> 00:10:36.536\nMany of us have probably had\nsome problems with that.\n\n00:10:36.560 --> 00:10:38.578\nSo, let's look at an old mouse here.\n\n00:10:38.912 --> 00:10:41.088\nThis is an old mouse\nthat has memory problems,\n\n00:10:41.112 --> 00:10:42.801\nas you'll notice in a moment.\n\n00:10:43.263 --> 00:10:47.987\nIt just looks into every hole,\nbut it didn't form this spacial map\n\n00:10:48.011 --> 00:10:53.258\nthat would remind it where it was\nin the previous trial or the last day.\n\n00:10:53.831 --> 00:10:59.298\nIn stark contrast, this mouse here\nis a sibling of the same age,\n\n00:10:59.322 --> 00:11:04.741\nbut it was treated with young\nhuman plasma for three weeks,\n\n00:11:04.765 --> 00:11:07.298\nwith small injections every three days.\n\n00:11:07.699 --> 00:11:11.922\nAnd as you noticed, it almost\nlooks around, \"Where am I?\" --\n\n00:11:11.946 --> 00:11:14.853\nand then walks straight\nto that hole and escapes.\n\n00:11:14.877 --> 00:11:17.741\nSo, it could remember where that hole was.\n\n00:11:18.700 --> 00:11:22.388\nSo by all means, this old mouse\nseems to be rejuvenated --\n\n00:11:22.412 --> 00:11:24.791\nit functions more like a younger mouse.\n\n00:11:24.815 --> 00:11:27.521\nAnd it also suggests\nthat there is something\n\n00:11:27.545 --> 00:11:32.536\nnot only in young mouse plasma,\nbut in young human plasma\n\n00:11:32.560 --> 00:11:36.220\nthat has the capacity\nto help this old brain.\n\n00:11:36.792 --> 00:11:37.944\nSo to summarize,\n\n00:11:37.968 --> 00:11:42.167\nwe find the old mouse, and its brain\nin particular, are malleable.\n\n00:11:42.191 --> 00:11:45.642\nThey're not set in stone;\nwe can actually change them.\n\n00:11:45.666 --> 00:11:47.139\nIt can be rejuvenated.\n\n00:11:47.638 --> 00:11:50.235\nYoung blood factors can reverse aging,\n\n00:11:50.259 --> 00:11:51.971\nand what I didn't show you --\n\n00:11:51.995 --> 00:11:57.217\nin this model, the young mouse actually\nsuffers from exposure to the old.\n\n00:11:57.241 --> 00:12:00.621\nSo there are old-blood factors\nthat can accelerate aging.\n\n00:12:01.683 --> 00:12:06.000\nAnd most importantly,\nhumans may have similar factors,\n\n00:12:06.024 --> 00:12:10.102\nbecause we can take young human\nblood and have a similar effect.\n\n00:12:10.550 --> 00:12:14.106\nOld human blood, I didn't show you,\ndoes not have this effect;\n\n00:12:14.130 --> 00:12:15.892\nit does not make the mice younger.\n\n00:12:17.029 --> 00:12:20.657\nSo, is this magic transferable to humans?\n\n00:12:20.681 --> 00:12:24.310\nWe're running a small\nclinical study at Stanford,\n\n00:12:24.334 --> 00:12:28.210\nwhere we treat Alzheimer's patients\nwith mild disease\n\n00:12:28.234 --> 00:12:34.844\nwith a pint of plasma\nfrom young volunteers, 20-year-olds,\n\n00:12:34.868 --> 00:12:37.463\nand do this once a week for four weeks,\n\n00:12:37.487 --> 00:12:40.650\nand then we look\nat their brains with imaging.\n\n00:12:41.008 --> 00:12:42.852\nWe test them cognitively,\n\n00:12:42.876 --> 00:12:46.882\nand we ask their caregivers\nfor daily activities of

factors\nthat are mediating these effects,\n\n00:13:19.035 --> 00:13:21.622\nwe can produce these factors synthetically\n\n00:13:21.646 --> 00:13:25.659\nand we can treat diseases of aging,\nsuch as

surveillance ... with the phone in your pocket", "duration": "376", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/christopher_soghoian_a_brief_history_of_phone_wiretapping_and_how_to_avoid_it", "transcript": "For more than 100 years, the telephone companies have provided wiretapping assistance to governments.For much of this time, this assistance was manual. Surveillance took place manually and wires were connected by hand. Calls were recorded to tape. But as in so many other industries, computing has changed everything. The telephone companies built surveillance features into the very core of their networks. I want that to sink in for a second: Our telephones and the networks that carry our calls were wired for surveillance first. First and foremost.So what that means is that when you're talking to your spouse, your children, a colleague or your doctor on the telephone, someone could be listening. Now, that someone might be your own government; it could also be another government, a foreign intelligence service, or a hacker, or a criminal, or a stalker or any other party that breaks into the surveillance system, that hacks into the surveillance system of the telephone companies.But while the telephone companies have built surveillance as a priority, Silicon Valley companies have not. And increasingly, over the last couple years, Silicon Valley companies have built strong encryption technology into their communications products that makes surveillance extremely difficult.For example, many of you might have an iPhone, and if you use an iPhone to send a text message to other people who have an iPhone, those text messages cannot easily be wiretapped. And in fact, according to Apple, they're not able to even see the text messages themselves. Likewise, if you use FaceTime to make an audio call or a video call with one of your friends or loved ones, that, too, cannot be easily wiretapped.And it's not just Apple. WhatsApp, which is now owned by Facebook and used by hundreds of millions of people around the world, also has built strong encryption technology into its product, which means that people in the Global South can easily communicate without their governments, often authoritarian, wiretapping their text messages.So, after 100 years of being able to listen to any telephone call \u2014 anytime, anywhere \u2014 you might imagine that government officials are not very happy. And in fact, that's what's happening. Government officials are extremely mad. And they're not mad because these encryption tools are now available. What upsets them the most is that the tech companies have built encryption features into their products and turned them on by default. It's the default piece that matters.In short, the tech companies have democratized encryption. And so, government officials like British Prime Minister David Cameron, they believe that all communications \u2014 emails, texts, voice calls \u2014 all of these should be available to governments, and encryption is making that difficult.Now, look \u2014 I'm extremely sympathetic to their point of view. We live in a dangerous time in a dangerous world, and there really are bad people out there. There are terrorists and other serious national security threats that I suspect we all want the FBI and the NSA to monitor.But those surveillance features come at a cost. The reason for that is that there is no such thing as a terrorist laptop, or a drug dealer's cell phone. We all use the same communications devices. What that means is that if the drug dealers' telephone calls or the terrorists' telephone calls can be intercepted, then so can the rest of ours, too. And I think we really need to ask: Should a billion people around the world be using devices that are wiretap friendly?So the scenario of hacking of surveillance systems that I've described \u2014 this is not imaginary. In 2009, the surveillance systems that Google and Microsoft built into their networks \u2014 the systems that they use to respond to lawful surveillance requests from the police \u2014 those systems were compromised by the Chinese government, because the Chinese government wanted to figure out which of their own agents the US government was monitoring.By the same token, in 2004, the surveillance system built into the network of Vodafone Greece \u2014 Greece's largest telephone company \u2014 was compromised by an unknown entity, and that feature, the surveillance feature, was used to wiretap the Greek Prime Minister and members of the Greek cabinet. The foreign government or hackers who did that were never caught.And really, this gets to the very problem with these surveillance features, or backdoors. When you build a backdoor into a communications network or piece of technology, you have no way of controlling who's going to go through it. You have no way of controlling whether it'll be used by your side or the other side, by good guys, or by bad guys.And so for that reason, I think that it's better to build networks to be as secure as possible. Yes, this means that in the future, encryption is going to make wiretapping more difficult. It means that the police are going to have a tougher time catching bad guys. But the alternative would mean to live in a world where anyone's calls or anyone's text messages could be surveilled by criminals, by stalkers and by foreign intelligence agencies. And I don't want to live in that kind of world.And so right now, you probably have the tools to thwart many kinds of government surveillance already on your phones and already in your pockets, you just might not realize how strong and how secure those tools are, or how weak the other ways you've used to communicate really are.And so, my message to you is this: We need to use these tools. We need to secure our telephone calls. We need to secure our text messages. I want you to use these tools. I want you to tell your loved ones, I want you to tell your colleagues: Use these encrypted communications tools. Don't just use them because they're cheap and easy, but use them because they're secure.Thank you.(Applause)", "id": 2314, "subtitle":

mountains, and I sort of came like a forest gnome to New York City a while back. (Laughter) Really messed with my head, but I'll get into that later.I'll start with when I was eight years old. I took a wood box, and I buried a dollar bill, a pen and a fork inside this box in Colorado. And I thought some strange humanoids or aliens in 500 years would find this box and learn about the way our species exchanged ideas, maybe how we ate our spaghetti. I really didn't know. Anyway, this is kind of funny, because here I am, 30 years later, and I'm still making boxes.Now, at some point I was in Hawaii \u2014 I like to hike and surf and do all that weird stuff, and I was making a collage for my ma. And I took a dictionary and I ripped it up, and I made it into a sort of Agnes Martin grid, and I poured resin all over it and a bee got stuck. Now, she's afraid of bees and she's allergic to them, so I poured more resin on the canvas, thinking I could hide it or something. Instead, the opposite happened: It sort of created a magnification, like a magnifying glass, on the dictionary text.So what did I do? I built more boxes. This time, I started putting electronics, frogs, strange bottles I'd find in the street \u2014 anything I could find \u2014 because I was always finding things my whole life, and trying to make relationships and tell stories between these objects. So I started drawing around the objects, and I realized: Holy moly, I can draw in space! I can make free-floating lines, like the way you would draw around a dead body at a crime scene. So I took the objects out, and I created my own taxonomy of invented specimens. First, botanical \u2014 which you can kind of get a sense of. Then I made some weird insects and creatures. It was really fun; I was just drawing on the layers of resin.And it was cool, because I was actually starting to have shows and stuff, I was making some money, I could take my girlfriend for dinner, and like, go to Sizzler. It was some good shit, man. (Laughter)At some point, I got up to the human form, life-size resin sculptures with drawings of humans inside the layers. This was great, except for one thing: I was going to die. I didn't know what to do, because the resin was going to kill me. And I went to bed every night thinking about it.So I tried using glass. I started drawing on the layers of glass, almost like if you drew on a window, then you put another window, and another window, and you had all these windows together that made a three-dimensional composition. And this really worked, because I could stop using the resin.So I did this for years, which culminated in a very large work, which I call \"The Triptych.\" \"The Triptych\" was largely inspired by Hieronymus Bosch's \"[The] Garden of Earthly Delights,\" which is a painting in the [Museo del] Prado in Spain. Do you guys know this painting? Good, it's a cool painting. It's kind of ahead of its time, they say. So, \"The Triptych.\" I'll walk you through this piece. It weighs 24,000 pounds. It's 18 feet long. It's double-sided, so it's 36 feet of composition. It's kind of weird. Well, that's the blood fountain. (Laughter) To the left, you have Jesus and the locusts. There's a cave where all these animal-headed creatures travel between two worlds. They go from the representational world, to this analog-mesh underworld, where they're hiding. This is where the animal-headed creatures are by the lighthouse, and they're all about to commit mass suicide into the ocean. The ocean is made up of thousands of elements. This is a bird god tied up to a battleship. (Laughter) Billy Graham is in the ocean; the Horizon from the oil spill; Waldo; Osama Bin Laden's shelter \u2014 there's all kinds of weird stuff that you can find if you look really hard, in the ocean. Anyway, this is a lady creature. She's coming out of the ocean, and she's spitting oil into one hand and she has clouds coming out of her other hand. Her hands are like scales, and she has the mythological reference of the Earth and cosmos in balance.So that's one side of \"The Triptych.\" It's a little narrative thing. That's her hand that she's spitting into. And then, when you go to the other side, she has like a trunk, like a bird's beak, and she's spitting clouds out of her trunk. Then she has an 18-foot-long serpent's tail that connects \"The Triptych.\" Anyway, her tail catches on fire from the back of the volcano. (Laughter) I don't know why that happened.(Laughter)That happens, you know. Her tail terminates in a cycloptic eyeball, made out of 1986 terrorist cards. Have you guys seen those? They were made in the 1980's, they're like baseball cards of terrorists. Way ahead of their time.(Laughter)That will bring you to my latest project. I'm in the middle of two projects: One's called \"Psychogeographies.\" It's about a six-year project to make 100 of these humans. Each one is an archive of our culture, through our ripped-up media and matter, whether it's encyclopedias or dictionaries or magazines. But each one acts as a sort of an archive in the shape of a human, and they travel in groups of 20, 4, or 12 at a time. They're like cells \u2014 they come together, they divide. And you kind of walk through them. It's taking me years. Each one is basically a 3,000-pound microscope slide with a human stuck inside.This one has a little cave in his chest. That's his head; there's the chest, you can kind of see the beginning. I'm going to go down the body for you: There's a waterfall coming out of his chest, covering his penis \u2014 or not-penis, or whatever it is, a kind of androgynous thing. I'll take you quickly through these works, because I can't explain them for too long. There are the layers, you can kind of see it. That's a body getting split in half. This one has two heads, and it's communicating between the two heads. You can see the pills coming out, going into one head from this weird statue. There's a little forest scene inside the chest cavity. Can you see that?Anyway, this talk's all about these boxes, like the boxes we're in. This box we're in, the solar system is a box. This brings you to my latest box. It's a brick box. It's called Pioneer Works.(Cheers)Inside of this box is a physicist, a neuroscientist, a painter, a musician, a writer, a radio station, a museum, a school, a publishing arm to disseminate all the content we make there into the world; a garden. We shake this box up, and all these people kind of start hitting each other like particles.And I think that's the way you change the world. You redefine your insides and the box that you're living in. And you come together to realize that we're all in this together, that this delusion of difference \u2014 this idea of countries, of borders, of religion \u2014 doesn't work. We're all really made up of the same stuff, in the same box. And if we don't start exchanging that stuff sweetly and nicely, we're all going to die real soon.Thank you very much.(Applause)", "id": 2319, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:14.728\nI was raised by lesbians in the mountains,\n\n00:00:14.752 --> 00:00:18.326\nand I sort of came like a forest gnome\nto New York City a while back.\n\n00:00:18.350 --> 00:00:19.484\n(Laughter)\n\n00:00:19.508 --> 00:00:24.292\nReally messed with my head,\nbut I'll get into that later.\n\n00:00:24.927 --> 00:00:27.353\nI'll start with when\nI was eight years old.\n\n00:00:27.697 --> 00:00:29.613\nI took a wood box,\n\n00:00:29.637 --> 00:00:34.732\nand I buried a dollar bill, a pen\nand a fork inside this box in Colorado.\n\n00:00:35.089 --> 00:00:40.673\nAnd I thought some strange humanoids\nor aliens in 500 years would find this box\n\n00:00:40.697 --> 00:00:45.223\nand learn about the way\nour species exchanged ideas,\n\n00:00:45.247 --> 00:00:47.281\nmaybe how we ate our spaghetti.\n\n00:00:47.305 --> 00:00:48.637\nI really didn't know.\n\n00:00:49.359 --> 00:00:50.796\nAnyway, this is kind of funny,\n\n00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:55.167\nbecause here I am, 30 years later,\nand I'm still making boxes.\n\n00:00:56.247 --> 00:00:59.230\nNow, at some point I was in Hawaii --\n\n00:00:59.254 --> 00:01:01.756\nI like to hike and surf\nand do all that weird stuff,\n\n00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:03.872\nand I was making a collage for my ma.\n\n00:01:04.308 --> 00:01:06.396\nAnd I took a dictionary\nand I ripped it up,\n\n00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:09.155\nand I made it into a sort\nof Agnes Martin grid,\n\n00:01:09.179 --> 00:01:11.750\nand I poured resin all over it\nand a bee got stuck.\n\n00:01:11.774 --> 00:01:14.492\nNow, she's afraid of bees\nand she's allergic to them,\n\n00:01:14.516 --> 00:01:18.751\nso I poured more resin on the canvas,\nthinking I could hide it or something.\n\n00:01:18.775 --> 00:01:20.315\nInstead, the opposite happened:\n\n00:01:20.339 --> 00:01:22.021\nIt sort of created a magnification,\n\n00:01:22.045 --> 00:01:24.433\nlike a magnifying glass,\non the dictionary text.\n\n00:01:25.236 --> 00:01:27.458\nSo what did I do? I built more boxes.\n\n00:01:27.916 --> 00:01:31.820\nThis time, I started putting\nelectronics, frogs,\n\n00:01:31.844 --> 00:01:35.391\nstrange bottles I'd find in the street --\nanything I could find --\n\n00:01:35.415 --> 00:01:37.764\nbecause I was always\nfinding things my whole life,\n\n00:01:37.788 --> 00:01:41.426\nand trying to make relationships\nand tell stories between these objects.\n\n00:01:41.854 --> 00:01:44.235\nSo I started drawing around the objects,\n\n00:01:44.259 --> 00:01:47.571\nand I realized: Holy moly,\nI can draw in space!\n\n00:01:47.595 --> 00:01:49.594\nI can make free-floating lines,\n\n00:01:49.618 --> 00:01:52.641\nlike the way you would draw\naround a dead body at a crime scene.\n\n00:01:52.665 --> 00:01:53.941\nSo I took the objects out,\n\n00:01:53.965 --> 00:01:56.930\nand I created my own taxonomy\nof invented specimens.\n\n00:01:57.418 --> 00:02:00.732\nFirst, botanical --\nwhich you can kind of get a sense of.\n\n00:02:01.478 --> 00:02:04.618\nThen I made some\nweird insects and creatures.\n\n00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:08.824\nIt was really fun; I was just\ndrawing on the layers of resin.\n\n00:02:08.848 --> 00:02:12.306\nAnd it was cool, because I was actually\nstarting to have shows and stuff,\n\n00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:15.302\nI was making some money,\nI could take my girlfriend for dinner,\n\n00:02:15.326 --> 00:02:16.581\nand like, go to Sizzler.\n\n00:02:16.605 --> 00:02:18.010\nIt was some good shit, man.\n\n00:02:18.034 --> 00:02:19.662\n(Laughter)\n\n00:02:19.686 --> 00:02:23.592\nAt some point, I got up to the human form,\n\n00:02:23.616 --> 00:02:28.243\nlife-size resin sculptures\nwith drawings of humans inside the layers.\n\n00:02:28.267 --> 00:02:30.726\nThis was great, except for one thing:\n\n00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:32.000\nI was going to die.\n\n00:02:32.494 --> 00:02:35.557\nI didn't know what to do,\nbecause the resin was going to kill me.\n\n00:02:35.581 --> 00:02:37.894\nAnd I went to bed every night\nthinking about it.\n\n00:02:37.918 --> 00:02:40.410\nSo I tried using glass.\n\n00:02:40.434 --> 00:02:42.423\nI started drawing on the layers of glass,\n\n00:02:42.447 --> 00:02:45.519\nalmost like if you drew on a window,\nthen you put another window,\n\n00:02:45.543 --> 00:02:48.286\nand another window, and you had\nall these windows together\n\n00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:50.445\nthat made a three-dimensional composition.\n\n00:02:50.469 --> 00:02:53.402\nAnd this really worked,\nbecause I could stop using the resin.\n\n00:02:53.895 --> 00:02:55.276\nSo I did this for years,\n\n00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:59.735\nwhich culminated in a very large work,\nwhich I call \"The Triptych.\"\n\n00:03:00.085 --> 00:03:02.006\n\"The Triptych\" was largely inspired\n\n00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:04.967\nby Hieronymus Bosch's\n\"[The] Garden of Earthly Delights,\"\n\n00:03:04.991 --> 00:03:07.615\nwhich is a painting\nin the [Museo del] Prado in Spain.\n\n00:03:07.639 --> 00:03:09.338\nDo you guys know this painting?\n\n00:03:09.362 --> 00:03:10.655\nGood, it's a cool painting.\n\n00:03:10.679 --> 00:03:12.653\nIt's kind of ahead of its time, they say.\n\n00:03:12.677 --> 00:03:15.168\nSo, \"The Triptych.\"\nI'll walk you through this piece.\n\n00:03:15.192 --> 00:03:17.490\nIt weighs 24,000 pounds.\n\n00:03:18.863 --> 00:03:20.840\nIt's 18 feet long.\n\n00:03:20.864 --> 00:03:23.615\nIt's double-sided,\nso it's 36 feet of composition.\n\n00:03:23.639 --> 00:03:24.797\nIt's kind of weird.\n\n00:03:26.606 --> 00:03:29.018\nWell, that's the blood fountain.\n\n00:03:29.042 --> 00:03:31.255\n(Laughter)\n\n00:03:31.279 --> 00:03:33.498\nTo the left, you have\nJesus and the locusts.\n\n00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:35.637\nThere's a cave\n\n00:03:35.661 --> 00:03:38.908\nwhere all these animal-headed creatures\ntravel between two worlds.\n\n00:03:38.932 --> 00:03:40.854\nThey go from the representational world,\n\n00:03:40.878 --> 00:03:43.762\nto this analog-mesh underworld,\nwhere they're hiding.\n\n00:03:43.786 --> 00:03:46.849\nThis is where the animal-headed creatures\nare by the lighthouse,\n\n00:03:46.873 --> 00:03:49.712\nand they're all about to commit\nmass suicide into the ocean.\n\n00:03:49.736 --> 00:03:52.704\nThe ocean is made up\nof thousands of elements.\n\n00:03:52.728 --> 00:03:55.027\nThis is a bird god\ntied up to a battleship.\n\n00:03:55.051 --> 00:03:56.089\n(Laughter)\n\n00:03:56.113 --> 00:03:57.717\nBilly Graham is in the ocean;\n\n00:03:57.741 --> 00:04:01.968\nthe Horizon from the oil spill;\nWaldo;

Quantum biology asks a very simple question: Does quantum mechanics \u2014 that weird and wonderful and powerful theory of the subatomic world of atoms and molecules that underpins so much of modern physics and chemistry \u2014 also play a role inside the living cell? In other words: Are there processes, mechanisms, phenomena in living organisms that can only be explained with a helping hand from quantum mechanics? Now, quantum biology isn't new; it's been around since the early 1930s. But it's only in the last decade or so that careful experiments \u2014 in biochemistry labs, using spectroscopy \u2014 have shown very clear, firm evidence that there are certain specific mechanisms that require quantum mechanics to explain them.Quantum biology brings together quantum physicists, biochemists, molecular biologists \u2014 it's a very interdisciplinary field. I come from quantum physics, so I'm a nuclear physicist.I've spent more than three decades trying to get my head around quantum mechanics. One of the founders of quantum mechanics, Niels Bohr, said, If you're not astonished by it, then you haven't understood it. So I sort of feel happy that I'm still astonished by it. That's a good thing. But it means I study the very smallest structures in the universe \u2014 the building blocks of reality. If we think about the scale of size, start with an everyday object like the tennis ball, and just go down orders of magnitude in size \u2014 from the eye of a needle down to a cell, down to a bacterium, down to an enzyme \u2014 you eventually reach the nano-world.Now, nanotechnology may be a term you've heard of. A nanometer is a billionth of a meter. My area is the atomic nucleus, which is the tiny dot inside an atom. It's even smaller in scale. This is the domain of quantum mechanics, and physicists and chemists have had a long time to try and get used to it. Biologists, on the other hand, have got off lightly, in my view. They are very happy with their balls-and-sticks models of molecules.(Laughter)The balls are the atoms, the sticks are the bonds between the atoms. And when they can't build them physically in the lab, nowadays, they have very powerful computers that will simulate a huge molecule. This is a protein made up of 100,000 atoms. It doesn't really require much in the way of quantum mechanics to explain it. Quantum mechanics was developed in the 1920s. It is a set of beautiful and powerful mathematical rules and ideas that explain the world of the very small. And it's a world that's very different from our everyday world, made up of trillions of atoms. It's a world built on probability and chance. It's a fuzzy world. It's a world of phantoms, where particles can also behave like spread-out waves.If we imagine quantum mechanics or quantum physics, then, as the fundamental foundation of reality itself, then it's not surprising that we say quantum physics underpins organic chemistry. After all, it gives us the rules that tell us how the atoms fit together to make organic molecules. Organic chemistry, scaled up in complexity, gives us molecular biology, which of course leads to life itself. So in a way, it's sort of not surprising. It's almost trivial. You say, \"Well, of course life ultimately must depend of quantum mechanics.\" But so does everything else. So does all inanimate matter, made up of trillions of atoms.Ultimately, there's a quantum level where we have to delve into this weirdness. But in everyday life, we can forget about it. Because once you put together trillions of atoms, that quantum weirdness just dissolves away. Quantum biology isn't about this. Quantum biology isn't this obvious. Of course quantum mechanics underpins life at some molecular level. Quantum biology is about looking for the non-trivial \u2014 the counterintuitive ideas in quantum mechanics \u2014 and to see if they do, indeed, play an important role in describing the processes of life.Here is my perfect example of the counterintuitiveness of the quantum world. This is the quantum skier. He seems to be intact, he seems to be perfectly healthy, and yet, he seems to have gone around both sides of that tree at the same time. Well, if you saw tracks like that you'd guess it was some sort of stunt, of course. But in the quantum world, this happens all the time. Particles can multitask, they can be in two places at once. They can do more than one thing at the same time. Particles can behave like spread-out waves. It's almost like magic.Physicists and chemists have had nearly a century of trying to get used to this weirdness. I don't blame the biologists for not having to or wanting to learn quantum mechanics.You see, this weirdness is very delicate; and we physicists work very hard to maintain it in our labs. We cool our system down to near absolute zero, we carry out our experiments in vacuums, we try and isolate it from any external disturbance. That's very different from the warm, messy, noisy environment of a living cell. Biology itself, if you think of molecular biology, seems to have done very well in describing all the processes of life in terms of chemistry \u2014 chemical reactions. And these are reductionist, deterministic chemical reactions, showing that, essentially, life is made of the same stuff as everything else, and if we can forget about quantum mechanics in the macro world, then we should be able to forget about it in biology, as well.Well, one man begged to differ with this idea. Erwin Schr\u00f6dinger, of Schr\u00f6dinger's Cat fame, was an Austrian physicist. He was one of the founders of quantum mechanics in the 1920s. In 1944, he wrote a book called \"What is Life?\" It was tremendously influential. It influenced Francis Crick and James Watson, the discoverers of the double-helix structure of DNA. To paraphrase a description in the book, he says: At the molecular level, living organisms have a certain order, a structure to them that's very different from the random thermodynamic jostling of atoms and molecules in inanimate matter of the same complexity.In fact, living matter seems to behave in this order, in a structure, just like inanimate matter cooled down to near absolute zero, where quantum effects play a very important role. There's something special about the structure \u2014 the order \u2014 inside a living cell. So, Schr\u00f6dinger speculated that maybe quantum mechanics plays a role in life. It's a very speculative, far-reaching idea, and it didn't really go very far.But as I mentioned at the start, in the last 10 years, there have been experiments emerging, showing where some of these certain phenomena in biology do seem to require quantum mechanics.I want to share with you just a few of the exciting ones. This is one of the best-known phenomena in the quantum world, quantum tunneling. The box on the left shows the wavelike, spread-out distribution of a quantum entity \u2014 a particle, like an electron, which is not a little ball bouncing off a wall. It's a wave that has a certain probability of being able to permeate through a solid wall, like a phantom leaping through to the other side. You can see a faint smudge of light in the right-hand box. Quantum tunneling suggests that a particle can hit an impenetrable barrier, and yet somehow, as though by magic, disappear from one side and reappear on the other. The nicest way of explaining it is if you want to throw a ball over a wall, you have to give it enough energy to get over the top of the wall. In the quantum world, you don't have to throw it over the wall, you can throw it at the wall, and there's a certain non-zero probability that it'll disappear on your side, and reappear on the other.This isn't speculation, by the way. We're happy \u2014 well, \"happy\" is not the right word \u2014(Laughter)we are familiar with this.(Laughter)Quantum tunneling takes place all the time; in fact, it's the reason our Sun shines. The particles fuse together, and the Sun turns hydrogen into helium through quantum tunneling. Back in the 70s and 80s, it was discovered that quantum tunneling also takes place inside living cells. Enzymes, those workhorses of life, the catalysts of chemical reactions \u2014 enzymes are biomolecules that speed up chemical reactions in living cells, by many, many orders of magnitude. And it's always been a mystery how they do this.Well, it was discovered that one of the tricks that enzymes have evolved to make use of, is by transferring subatomic particles, like electrons and indeed protons, from one part of a molecule to another via quantum tunneling. It's efficient, it's fast, it can disappear \u2014 a proton can disappear from one place, and reappear on the other. Enzymes help this take place.This is research that's been carried out back in the 80s, particularly by a group in Berkeley, Judith Klinman. Other groups in the UK have now also confirmed that enzymes really do this.Research carried out by my group \u2014 so as I mentioned, I'm a nuclear physicist, but I've realized I've got these tools of using quantum mechanics in atomic nuclei, and so can apply those tools in other areas as well. One question we asked is whether quantum tunneling plays a role in mutations in DNA. Again, this is not a new idea; it goes all the way back to the early 60s. The two strands of DNA, the double-helix structure, are held together by rungs; it's like a twisted ladder. And those rungs of the ladder are hydrogen bonds \u2014 protons, that act as the glue between the two strands. So if you zoom in, what they're doing is holding these large molecules \u2014 nucleotides \u2014 together. Zoom in a bit more. So, this a computer simulation. The two white balls in the middle are protons, and you can see that it's a double hydrogen bond. One prefers to sit on one side; the other, on the other side of the two strands of the vertical lines going down, which you can't see. It can happen that these two protons can hop over. Watch the two white balls. They can jump over to the other side. If the two strands of DNA then separate, leading to the process of replication, and the two protons are in the wrong positions, this can lead to a mutation.This has been known for half a century. The question is: How likely are they to do that, and if they do, how do they do it? Do they jump across, like the ball going over the wall? Or can they quantum-tunnel across, even if they don't have enough energy? Early indications suggest that quantum tunneling can play a role here. We still don't know yet how important it is; this is still an open question. It's speculative, but it's one of those questions that is so important that if quantum mechanics plays a role in mutations, surely this must have big implications, to understand certain types of mutations, possibly even those that lead to turning a cell cancerous.Another example of quantum mechanics in biology is quantum coherence, in one of the most important processes in biology, photosynthesis: plants and bacteria taking sunlight, and using that energy to create biomass. Quantum coherence is the idea of quantum entities multitasking. It's the quantum skier. It's an object that behaves like a wave, so that it doesn't just move in one direction or the other, but can follow multiple pathways at the same time.Some years ago, the world of science was shocked when a paper was published showing experimental evidence that quantum coherence takes place inside bacteria, carrying out photosynthesis. The idea is that the photon, the particle of light, the sunlight, the quantum of light captured by a chlorophyll molecule, is then delivered to what's called the reaction center, where it can be turned into chemical energy. And in getting there, it doesn't just follow one route; it follows multiple pathways at once, to optimize the most efficient way of reaching the reaction center without dissipating as waste heat. Quantum coherence taking place inside a living cell. A remarkable idea, and yet evidence is growing almost weekly, with new papers coming out, confirming that this does indeed take place.My third and final example is the most beautiful, wonderful idea. It's also still very speculative, but I have to share it with you. The European robin migrates from Scandinavia down to the Mediterranean, every autumn, and like a lot of other marine animals and even insects, they navigate by sensing the Earth's magnetic field. Now, the Earth's magnetic field is very, very weak; it's 100 times weaker than a fridge magnet, and yet it affects the chemistry \u2014 somehow \u2014 within a living organism. That's not in doubt \u2014 a German couple of ornithologists, Wolfgang and Roswitha Wiltschko, in the 1970s, confirmed that indeed, the robin does find its way by somehow sensing the Earth's magnetic field, to give it directional information \u2014 a built-in compass.The puzzle, the mystery was: How does it do it? Well, the only theory in town \u2014 we don't know if it's the correct theory, but the only theory in town \u2014 is that it does it via something called quantum entanglement. Inside the robin's retina \u2014 I kid you not \u2014 inside the robin's retina is a protein called cryptochrome, which is light-sensitive. Within cryptochrome, a pair of electrons are quantum-entangled. Now, quantum entanglement is when two particles are far apart, and yet somehow remain in contact with each other. Even Einstein hated this idea; he called it \"spooky action at a distance.\"(Laughter)So if Einstein doesn't like it, then we can all be uncomfortable with it. Two quantum-entangled electrons within a single molecule dance a delicate dance that is very sensitive to the direction the bird flies in the Earth's magnetic field.We don't know if it's the correct explanation, but wow, wouldn't it be exciting if quantum mechanics helps birds navigate? Quantum biology is still in it infancy. It's still speculative. But I believe it's built on solid science. I also think that in the coming decade or so, we're going to start to see that actually, it pervades life \u2014 that life has evolved tricks that utilize the quantum world.

reality.\n\n00:01:53.839 --> 00:01:57.054\nIf we think about the scale of size,\n\n00:01:57.078 --> 00:02:00.030\nstart with an everyday object\nlike the tennis ball,\n\n00:02:00.054 --> 00:02:02.955\nand just go down orders\nof magnitude in size --\n\n00:02:02.979 --> 00:02:08.176\nfrom the eye of a needle down to a cell,\ndown to a bacterium, down to an enzyme --\n\n00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:09.929\nyou eventually reach the nano-world.\n\n00:02:09.953 --> 00:02:12.448\nNow, nanotechnology may be\na term you've heard of.\n\n00:02:12.799 --> 00:02:15.652\nA nanometer is a billionth of a meter.\n\n00:02:16.518 --> 00:02:20.888\nMy area is the atomic nucleus,\nwhich is the tiny dot inside an atom.\n\n00:02:20.912 --> 00:02:22.844\nIt's even smaller in scale.\n\n00:02:22.868 --> 00:02:24.786\nThis is the domain of quantum mechanics,\n\n00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:27.326\nand physicists and chemists\nhave had a long time\n\n00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:28.651\nto try and get used to it.\n\n00:02:29.206 --> 00:02:33.663\nBiologists, on the other hand,\nhave got off lightly, in my view.\n\n00:02:34.029 --> 00:02:38.360\nThey are very happy with their\nballs-and-sticks models of molecules.\n\n00:02:38.384 --> 00:02:39.466\n(Laughter)\n\n00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:42.688\nThe balls are the atoms, the sticks\nare the bonds between the atoms.\n\n00:02:42.712 --> 00:02:45.206\nAnd when they can't build them\nphysically in the lab,\n\n00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:47.622\nnowadays, they have\nvery powerful computers\n\n00:02:47.646 --> 00:02:49.613\nthat will simulate a huge molecule.\n\n00:02:49.637 --> 00:02:53.301\nThis is a protein made up\nof 100,000 atoms.\n\n00:02:53.961 --> 00:02:58.296\nIt doesn't really require much in the way\nof quantum mechanics to explain it.\n\n00:02:59.653 --> 00:03:02.542\nQuantum mechanics\nwas developed in the 1920s.\n\n00:03:02.923 --> 00:03:09.803\nIt is a set of beautiful and powerful\nmathematical rules and ideas\n\n00:03:09.827 --> 00:03:12.435\nthat explain the world of the very small.\n\n00:03:12.459 --> 00:03:15.831\nAnd it's a world that's very different\nfrom our everyday world,\n\n00:03:15.855 --> 00:03:17.374\nmade up of trillions of atoms.\n\n00:03:17.398 --> 00:03:20.955\nIt's a world built\non probability and chance.\n\n00:03:21.776 --> 00:03:23.078\nIt's a fuzzy world.\n\n00:03:23.102 --> 00:03:24.832\nIt's a world of phantoms,\n\n00:03:24.856 --> 00:03:28.204\nwhere particles can also behave\nlike spread-out waves.\n\n00:03:30.115 --> 00:03:32.977\nIf we imagine quantum mechanics\nor quantum physics, then,\n\n00:03:33.001 --> 00:03:38.215\nas the fundamental\nfoundation of reality itself,\n\n00:03:38.239 --> 00:03:39.969\nthen it's not surprising that we say\n\n00:03:39.993 --> 00:03:42.413\nquantum physics underpins\norganic chemistry.\n\n00:03:42.437 --> 00:03:44.557\nAfter all, it gives us\nthe rules that tell us\n\n00:03:44.581 --> 00:03:47.222\nhow the atoms fit together\nto make organic molecules.\n\n00:03:47.246 --> 00:03:50.485\nOrganic chemistry,\nscaled up in complexity,\n\n00:03:50.509 --> 00:03:53.831\ngives us molecular biology,\nwhich of course leads to life itself.\n\n00:03:54.132 --> 00:03:56.109\nSo in a way, it's sort of not surprising.\n\n00:03:56.133 --> 00:03:57.347\nIt's almost trivial.\n\n00:03:57.371 --> 00:04:01.591\nYou say, \"Well, of course life ultimately\nmust depend of quantum mechanics.\"\n\n00:04:02.099 --> 00:04:04.489\nBut so does everything else.\n\n00:04:04.513 --> 00:04:08.128\nSo does all inanimate matter,\nmade up of trillions of atoms.\n\n00:04:08.459 --> 00:04:13.337\nUltimately, there's a quantum level\n\n00:04:13.361 --> 00:04:15.544\nwhere we have to delve into\nthis weirdness.\n\n00:04:15.568 --> 00:04:17.984\nBut in everyday life,\nwe can forget about it.\n\n00:04:18.362 --> 00:04:21.561\nBecause once you put together\ntrillions of atoms,\n\n00:04:21.585 --> 00:04:24.200\nthat quantum weirdness\njust dissolves away.\n\n00:04:27.246 --> 00:04:29.815\nQuantum biology isn't about this.\n\n00:04:29.839 --> 00:04:32.395\nQuantum biology isn't this obvious.\n\n00:04:32.419 --> 00:04:36.648\nOf course quantum mechanics\nunderpins life at some molecular level.\n\n00:04:37.212 --> 00:04:43.216\nQuantum biology is about looking\nfor the non-trivial --\n\n00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:47.716\nthe counterintuitive ideas\nin quantum mechanics --\n\n00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:50.755\nand to see if they do, indeed,\nplay an important role\n\n00:04:50.779 --> 00:04:53.231\nin describing the processes of life.\n\n00:04:54.611 --> 00:04:59.831\nHere is my perfect example\nof the counterintuitiveness\n\n00:04:59.855 --> 00:05:01.301\nof the quantum world.\n\n00:05:01.325 --> 00:05:02.576\nThis is the quantum skier.\n\n00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:05.240\nHe seems to be intact,\nhe seems to be perfectly healthy,\n\n00:05:05.264 --> 00:05:09.391\nand yet, he seems to have gone around\nboth sides of that tree at the same time.\n\n00:05:09.415 --> 00:05:11.078\nWell, if you saw tracks like that\n\n00:05:11.102 --> 00:05:13.411\nyou'd guess it was some\nsort of stunt, of course.\n\n00:05:13.435 --> 00:05:16.026\nBut in the quantum world,\nthis happens all the time.\n\n00:05:16.822 --> 00:05:19.848\nParticles can multitask,\nthey can be in two places at once.\n\n00:05:19.872 --> 00:05:22.200\nThey can do more than one thing\nat the same time.\n\n00:05:22.224 --> 00:05:24.867\nParticles can behave\nlike spread-out waves.\n\n00:05:25.256 --> 00:05:26.855\nIt's almost like magic.\n\n00:05:27.496 --> 00:05:30.245\nPhysicists and chemists have had\nnearly a century\n\n00:05:30.269 --> 00:05:32.915\nof trying to get used to this weirdness.\n\n00:05:33.403 --> 00:05:34.753\nI don't blame the biologists\n\n00:05:34.777 --> 00:05:37.412\nfor not having to or wanting\nto learn quantum mechanics.\n\n00:05:37.436 --> 00:05:40.634\nYou see, this weirdness is very delicate;\n\n00:05:40.658 --> 00:05:45.108\nand we physicists work very hard\nto maintain it in our labs.\n\n00:05:45.132 --> 00:05:49.336\nWe cool our system down\nto near absolute zero,\n\n00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:51.305\nwe carry out our experiments in vacuums,\n\n00:05:51.329 --> 00:05:54.856\nwe try and isolate it\nfrom any external disturbance.\n\n00:05:55.560 --> 00:06:00.638\nThat's very different from the warm,\nmessy, noisy environment of a living cell.\n\n00:06:01.918 --> 00:06:04.705\nBiology itself, if you think of\nmolecular biology,\n\n00:06:04.729 --> 00:06:08.186\nseems to have done very well\nin describing all the processes of life\n\n00:06:08.210 --> 00:06:10.696\nin terms of chemistry --\nchemical reactions.\n\n00:06:10.720 --> 00:06:15.570\nAnd these are reductionist,\ndeterministic chemical reactions,\n\n00:06:15.594 --> 00:06:20.708\nshowing that, essentially, life is made\nof the same stuff as everything else,\n\n00:06:20.732 --> 00:06:23.792\nand if we can forget about quantum\nmechanics in the macro world,\n\n00:06:23.816 --> 00:06:27.062\nthen we should be able to forget\nabout it in biology, as well.\n\n00:06:27.664 --> 00:06:31.028\nWell, one man begged\nto differ with this idea.\n\n00:06:32.020 --> 00:06:35.489\nErwin Schr\u00f6dinger,\nof Schr\u00f6dinger's Cat fame,\n\n00:06:35.513 --> 00:06:36.830\nwas an Austrian physicist.\n\n00:06:36.854 --> 00:06:40.037\nHe was one of the founders\nof quantum mechanics in the 1920s.\n\n00:06:40.621 --> 00:06:43.328\nIn 1944, he wrote a book\ncalled \"What is Life?\"\n\n00:06:43.797 --> 00:06:45.528\nIt was tremendously influential.\n\n00:06:45.552 --> 00:06:48.433\nIt influenced Francis Crick\nand James Watson,\n\n00:06:48.457 --> 00:06:50.980\nthe discoverers of the double-helix\nstructure of DNA.\n\n00:06:51.301 --> 00:06:54.969\nTo paraphrase a description\nin the book, he says:\n\n00:06:54.993 --> 00:07:00.779\nAt the molecular level,\nliving organisms have a certain order,\n\n00:07:00.803 --> 00:07:04.035\na structure to them that's very different\n\n00:07:04.059 --> 00:07:08.795\nfrom the random thermodynamic jostling\nof atoms and molecules\n\n00:07:08.819 --> 00:07:12.525\nin inanimate matter\nof the same complexity.\n\n00:07:13.462 --> 00:07:18.476\nIn fact, living matter seems to behave\nin this order, in a structure,\n\n00:07:18.500 --> 00:07:22.334\njust like inanimate matter\ncooled down to near absolute zero,\n\n00:07:22.358 --> 00:07:25.391\nwhere quantum effects\nplay a very important role.\n\n00:07:26.238 --> 00:07:30.398\nThere's something special\nabout the structure -- the order --\n\n00:07:30.422 --> 00:07:31.982\ninside a living cell.\n\n00:07:32.006 --> 00:07:37.299\nSo, Schr\u00f6dinger speculated that maybe\nquantum mechanics plays a role in life.\n\n00:07:38.054 --> 00:07:41.479\nIt's a very speculative,\nfar-reaching idea,\n\n00:07:41.503 --> 00:07:44.376\nand it didn't really go very far.\n\n00:07:45.494 --> 00:07:47.027\nBut as I mentioned at the start,\n\n00:07:47.051 --> 00:07:49.850\nin the last 10 years, there have been\nexperiments emerging,\n\n00:07:49.874 --> 00:07:53.929\nshowing where some of these\ncertain phenomena in biology\n\n00:07:53.953 --> 00:07:55.716\ndo seem to require quantum mechanics.\n\n00:07:55.740 --> 00:07:58.863\nI want to share with you\njust a few of the exciting ones.\n\n00:08:00.173 --> 00:08:03.880\nThis is one of the best-known\nphenomena in the quantum world,\n\n00:08:03.904 --> 00:08:05.605\nquantum tunneling.\n\n00:08:05.629 --> 00:08:10.018\nThe box on the left shows\nthe wavelike, spread-out distribution\n\n00:08:10.042 --> 00:08:12.803\nof a quantum entity --\na particle, like an electron,\n\n00:08:12.827 --> 00:08:16.464\nwhich is not a little ball\nbouncing off a wall.\n\n00:08:16.488 --> 00:08:21.227\nIt's a wave that has a certain probability\nof being able to permeate\n\n00:08:21.251 --> 00:08:24.657\nthrough a solid wall, like a phantom\nleaping through to the other side.\n\n00:08:24.681 --> 00:08:28.779\nYou can see a faint smudge of light\nin the right-hand box.\n\n00:08:29.731 --> 00:08:34.343\nQuantum tunneling suggests that a particle\ncan hit an impenetrable barrier,\n\n00:08:34.367 --> 00:08:36.827\nand yet somehow, as though by magic,\n\n00:08:36.851 --> 00:08:39.295\ndisappear from one side\nand reappear on the other.\n\n00:08:39.616 --> 00:08:43.867\nThe nicest way of explaining it is\nif you want to throw a ball over a wall,\n\n00:08:43.891 --> 00:08:47.468\nyou have to give it enough energy\nto get over the top of the wall.\n\n00:08:47.492 --> 00:08:50.550\nIn the quantum world,\nyou don't have to throw it over the wall,\n\n00:08:50.574 --> 00:08:53.981\nyou can throw it at the wall,\nand there's a certain non-zero probability\n\n00:08:54.005 --> 00:08:57.328\nthat it'll disappear on your side,\nand reappear on the other.\n\n00:08:57.352 --> 00:08:59.030\nThis isn't speculation, by the way.\n\n00:08:59.054 --> 00:09:02.450\nWe're happy -- well, \"happy\"\nis not the right word --\n\n00:09:02.474 --> 00:09:04.519\n(Laughter)\n\n00:09:04.543 --> 00:09:06.161\nwe are familiar with this.\n\n00:09:06.185 --> 00:09:08.930\n(Laughter)\n\n00:09:08.954 --> 00:09:11.248\nQuantum tunneling\ntakes place all the time;\n\n00:09:11.272 --> 00:09:13.939\nin fact, it's the reason our Sun shines.\n\n00:09:14.613 --> 00:09:16.122\nThe particles fuse together,\n\n00:09:16.146 --> 00:09:19.844\nand the Sun turns hydrogen\ninto helium through quantum tunneling.\n\n00:09:21.422 --> 00:09:26.642\nBack in the 70s and 80s, it was discovered\nthat quantum tunneling also takes place\n\n00:09:26.666 --> 00:09:27.858\ninside living cells.\n\n00:09:28.248 --> 00:09:34.514\nEnzymes, those workhorses of life,\nthe catalysts of chemical reactions --\n\n00:09:34.538 --> 00:09:38.704\nenzymes are biomolecules that speed up\nchemical reactions in living cells,\n\n00:09:38.728 --> 00:09:40.431\nby many, many orders of magnitude.\n\n00:09:40.455 --> 00:09:43.239\nAnd it's always been a mystery\nhow they do this.\n\n00:09:43.608 --> 00:09:44.797\nWell, it was discovered\n\n00:09:44.821 --> 00:09:49.673\nthat one of the tricks that enzymes\nhave evolved to make use of,\n\n00:09:49.697 --> 00:09:54.925\nis by transferring subatomic particles,\nlike electrons and indeed protons,\n\n00:09:54.949 --> 00:09:59.610\nfrom one part of a molecule\nto another via quantum tunneling.\n\n00:10:00.291 --> 00:10:03.142\nIt's efficient, it's fast,\nit can disappear --\n\n00:10:03.166 --> 00:10:06.277\na proton can disappear from one place,\nand reappear on the other.\n\n00:10:06.301 --> 00:10:07.930\nEnzymes help this take place.\n\n00:10:08.506 --> 00:10:11.189\nThis is research that's been\ncarried out back in the 80s,\n\n00:10:11.213 --> 00:10:15.250\nparticularly by a group\nin Berkeley, Judith Klinman.\n\n00:10:15.274 --> 00:10:17.479\nOther groups in the UK\nhave now also confirmed\n\n00:10:17.503 --> 00:10:18.914\nthat enzymes really do this.\n\n00:10:21.006 --> 00:10:23.555\nResearch carried out by my group --\n\n00:10:23.579 --> 00:10:26.013\nso as I mentioned,\nI'm a nuclear physicist,\n\n00:10:26.037 --> 00:10:29.092\nbut I've realized I've got these tools\nof using quantum mechanics\n\n00:10:29.116 --> 00:10:34.201\nin atomic nuclei, and so can apply\nthose tools in other areas as well.\n\n00:10:35.362 --> 00:10:37.172\nOne question we asked\n\n00:10:37.196 --> 00:10:41.494\nis whether quantum tunneling\nplays a role in mutations in DNA.\n\n00:10:41.801 --> 00:10:45.461\nAgain, this is not a new idea;\nit goes all the way back to the early 60s.\n\n00:10:45.485 --> 00:10:48.446\nThe two strands of DNA,\nthe double-helix structure,\n\n00:10:48.470 --> 00:10:51.293\nare held together by rungs;\nit's like a twisted ladder.\n\n00:10:51.317 --> 00:10:54.824\nAnd those rungs of the ladder\nare hydrogen bonds --\n\n00:10:54.848 --> 00:10:58.638\nprotons, that act as the glue\nbetween the two strands.\n\n00:10:58.662 --> 00:11:03.412\nSo if you zoom in, what they're doing\nis holding these large molecules --\n\n00:11:03.436 --> 00:11:05.043\nnucleotides -- together.\n\n00:11:06.088 --> 00:11:07.238\nZoom in a bit more.\n\n00:11:07.262 --> 00:11:09.178\nSo, this a computer simulation.\n\n00:11:09.813 --> 00:11:13.355\nThe two white balls\nin the middle are protons,\n\n00:11:13.379 --> 00:11:15.678\nand you can see that\nit's a double hydrogen bond.\n\n00:11:15.702 --> 00:11:19.016\nOne prefers to sit on one side;\nthe other, on the other side\n\n00:11:19.040 --> 00:11:23.598\nof the two strands of the vertical lines\ngoing down, which you can't see.\n\n00:11:24.368 --> 00:11:27.763\nIt can happen that\nthese two protons can hop over.\n\n00:11:27.787 --> 00:11:29.223\nWatch the two white balls.\n\n00:11:29.706 --> 00:11:31.704\nThey can jump over to the other side.\n\n00:11:32.197 --> 00:11:37.843\nIf the two strands of DNA then separate,\nleading to the process of replication,\n\n00:11:37.867 --> 00:11:41.066\nand the two protons\nare in the wrong positions,\n\n00:11:41.090 --> 00:11:42.853\nthis can lead to a mutation.\n\n00:11:43.162 --> 00:11:45.034\nThis has been known for half a century.\n\n00:11:45.058 --> 00:11:47.401\nThe question is: How likely\nare they to do that,\n\n00:11:47.425 --> 00:11:49.803\nand if they do, how do they do it?\n\n00:11:49.827 --> 00:11:52.846\nDo they jump across,\nlike the ball going over the wall?\n\n00:11:52.870 --> 00:11:56.372\nOr can they quantum-tunnel across,\neven if they don't have enough energy?\n\n00:11:57.047 --> 00:12:01.299\nEarly indications suggest that\nquantum tunneling can play a role here.\n\n00:12:01.323 --> 00:12:03.447\nWe still don't know yet\nhow important it is;\n\n00:12:03.471 --> 00:12:05.263\nthis is still an open question.\n\n00:12:06.157 --> 00:12:07.307\nIt's speculative,\n\n00:12:07.331 --> 00:12:09.974\nbut it's one of those questions\nthat is so important\n\n00:12:09.998 --> 00:12:12.444\nthat if quantum mechanics\nplays a role in mutations,\n\n00:12:12.468 --> 00:12:14.767\nsurely this must have big implications,\n\n00:12:14.791 --> 00:12:17.485\nto understand certain types of mutations,\n\n00:12:17.509 --> 00:12:21.265\npossibly even those that lead\nto turning a cell cancerous.\n\n00:12:22.761 --> 00:12:28.060\nAnother example of quantum mechanics\nin biology is quantum coherence,\n\n00:12:28.084 --> 00:12:30.437\nin one of the most\nimportant processes in biology,\n\n00:12:30.461 --> 00:12:34.402\nphotosynthesis: plants\nand bacteria taking sunlight,\n\n00:12:34.426 --> 00:12:37.380\nand using that energy to create biomass.\n\n00:12:38.173 --> 00:12:42.325\nQuantum coherence is the idea\nof quantum entities multitasking.\n\n00:12:42.870 --> 00:12:44.474\nIt's the quantum skier.\n\n00:12:44.498 --> 00:12:47.450\nIt's an object that behaves like a wave,\n\n00:12:47.474 --> 00:12:50.376\nso that it doesn't just move\nin one direction or the other,\n\n00:12:50.400 --> 00:12:53.720\nbut can follow multiple pathways\nat the same time.\n\n00:12:54.666 --> 00:12:58.582\nSome years ago,\nthe world of science was shocked\n\n00:12:58.606 --> 00:13:02.190\nwhen a paper was published\nshowing experimental evidence\n\n00:13:02.214 --> 00:13:05.990\nthat quantum coherence\ntakes place inside bacteria,\n\n00:13:06.014 --> 00:13:07.700\ncarrying out photosynthesis.\n\n00:13:07.724 --> 00:13:10.788\nThe idea is that the photon,\nthe particle of light, the sunlight,\n\n00:13:10.812 --> 00:13:14.156\nthe quantum of light\ncaptured by a chlorophyll molecule,\n\n00:13:14.180 --> 00:13:16.771\nis then delivered to what's called\nthe reaction center,\n\n00:13:16.795 --> 00:13:18.859\nwhere it can be turned into\nchemical energy.\n\n00:13:18.883 --> 00:13:21.531\nAnd in getting there,\nit doesn't just follow one route;\n\n00:13:21.555 --> 00:13:23.770\nit follows multiple pathways at once,\n\n00:13:23.794 --> 00:13:28.131\nto optimize the most efficient way\nof reaching the reaction center\n\n00:13:28.155 --> 00:13:29.876\nwithout dissipating as waste heat.\n\n00:13:31.186 --> 00:13:34.495\nQuantum coherence taking place\ninside a living cell.\n\n00:13:34.519 --> 00:13:36.639\nA remarkable idea,\n\n00:13:36.663 --> 00:13:42.898\nand yet evidence is growing almost weekly,\nwith new papers coming out,\n\n00:13:42.922 --> 00:13:45.134\nconfirming that this\ndoes indeed take place.\n\n00:13:45.513 --> 00:13:50.252\nMy third and final example\nis the most beautiful, wonderful idea.\n\n00:13:50.276 --> 00:13:54.339\nIt's also still very speculative,\nbut I have to share it with you.\n\n00:13:54.363 --> 00:13:58.975\nThe European robin\nmigrates from Scandinavia\n\n00:13:58.999 --> 00:14:01.634\ndown to the Mediterranean, every autumn,\n\n00:14:01.658 --> 00:14:05.031\nand like a lot of other\nmarine animals and even insects,\n\n00:14:05.055 --> 00:14:09.355\nthey navigate by sensing\nthe Earth's magnetic field.\n\n00:14:10.926 --> 00:14:13.353\nNow, the Earth's magnetic field\nis very, very weak;\n\n00:14:13.377 --> 00:14:15.457\nit's 100 times weaker\nthan a fridge magnet,\n\n00:14:15.481 --> 00:14:21.082\nand yet it affects the chemistry --\nsomehow -- within a living organism.\n\n00:14:21.890 --> 00:14:25.696\nThat's not in doubt --\na German couple of ornithologists,\n\n00:14:25.720 --> 00:14:29.980\nWolfgang and Roswitha Wiltschko,\nin the 1970s, confirmed that indeed,\n\n00:14:30.004 --> 00:14:33.981\nthe robin does find its way by somehow\nsensing the Earth's magnetic field,\n\n00:14:34.005 --> 00:14:37.332\nto give it directional information --\na built-in compass.\n\n00:14:37.356 --> 00:14:39.605\nThe puzzle, the mystery was:\nHow does it do it?\n\n00:14:40.309 --> 00:14:43.339\nWell, the only theory in town --\n\n00:14:43.363 --> 00:14:46.799\nwe don't know if it's the correct theory,\nbut the only theory in town --\n\n00:14:46.823 --> 00:14:49.807\nis that it does it via something\ncalled quantum entanglement.\n\n00:14:50.525 --> 00:14:52.899\nInside the robin's retina --\n\n00:14:52.923 --> 00:14:57.155\nI kid you not -- inside the robin's retina\nis a protein called cryptochrome,\n\n00:14:57.179 --> 00:14:58.559\nwhich is light-sensitive.\n\n00:14:58.583 --> 00:15:02.522\nWithin cryptochrome, a pair of electrons\nare quantum-entangled.\n\n00:15:02.546 --> 00:15:05.778\nNow, quantum entanglement\nis when two particles are far apart,\n\n00:15:05.802 --> 00:15:08.636\nand yet somehow remain\nin contact with each other.\n\n00:15:08.949 --> 00:15:10.395\nEven Einstein hated this idea;\n\n00:15:10.419 --> 00:15:12.458\nhe called it \"spooky action\nat a distance.\"\n\n00:15:12.482 --> 00:15:14.363\n(Laughter)\n\n00:15:14.387 --> 00:15:17.830\nSo if Einstein doesn't like it,\nthen we can all be uncomfortable with it.\n\n00:15:17.854 --> 00:15:20.707\nTwo quantum-entangled electrons\nwithin a single molecule\n\n00:15:20.731 --> 00:15:22.202\ndance a delicate dance\n\n00:15:22.226 --> 00:15:24.767\nthat is very sensitive\nto the direction the bird flies\n\n00:15:24.791 --> 00:15:26.322\nin the Earth's magnetic field.\n\n00:15:26.806 --> 00:15:29.416\nWe don't know if it's\nthe correct explanation,\n\n00:15:29.440 --> 00:15:33.984\nbut wow, wouldn't it be exciting\nif quantum mechanics helps birds navigate?\n\n00:15:35.027 --> 00:15:37.748\nQuantum biology is still in it infancy.\n\n00:15:37.772 --> 00:15:41.256\nIt's still speculative.\n\n00:15:41.700 --> 00:15:45.549\nBut I believe it's built on solid science.\n\n00:15:45.875 --> 00:15:49.684\nI also think that\nin the coming decade or so,\n\n00:15:49.708 --> 00:15:54.549\nwe're going to start to see\nthat actually, it pervades life --\n\n00:15:54.573 --> 00:15:59.169\nthat life has evolved tricks\nthat utilize the quantum world.\n\n00:15:59.984 --> 00:16:01.412\nWatch this space.\n\n00:16:01.436 --> 00:16:02.593\nThank you.\n\n00:16:02.617 --> 00:16:04.819\n(Applause)"}, {"title": "The troubling reason why vaccines are made too late ... if they're made at all", "duration": "437", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/seth_berkley_the_troubling_reason_why_vaccines_are_made_too_late_if_they_re_made_at_all", "transcript": "The child's symptoms begin with mild fever, headache, muscle pains, followed by vomiting and diarrhea, then bleeding from the mouth, nose and gums. Death follows in the form of organ failure from low blood pressure.Sounds familiar? If you're thinking this is Ebola, actually, in this case, it's not. It's an extreme form of dengue fever, a mosquito-born disease which also does not have an effective therapy or a vaccine, and kills 22,000 people each year. That is actually twice the number of people that have been killed by Ebola in the nearly four decades that we've known about it. As for measles, so much in the news recently, the death toll is actually tenfold higher. Yet for the last year, it has been Ebola that has stolen all of the headlines and the fear.Clearly, there is something deeply rooted about it, something which scares us and fascinates us more than other diseases. But what is it, exactly? Well, it's hard to acquire Ebola, but if you do, the risk of a horrible death is high. Why? Because right now, we don't have any effective therapy or vaccine available.And so, that's the clue. We may have it someday. So we rightfully fear Ebola, because it doesn't kill as many people as other diseases. In fact, it's much less transmissible than viruses such as flu or measles. We fear Ebola because of the fact that it kills us and we can't treat it. We fear the certain inevitability that comes with Ebola. Ebola has this inevitability that seems to defy modern medical science.But wait a second, why is that? We've known about Ebola since 1976. We've known what it's capable of. We've had ample opportunity to study it in the 24 outbreaks that have occurred. And in fact, we've actually had vaccine candidates available now for more than a decade. Why is that those vaccines are just going into clinical trials now?This goes to the fundamental problem we have with vaccine development for infectious diseases. It goes something like this: The people most at risk for these diseases are also the ones least able to pay for vaccines. This leaves little in the way of market incentives for manufacturers to develop vaccines, unless there are large numbers of people who are at risk in wealthy countries. It's simply too commercially risky.As for Ebola, there is absolutely no market at all, so the only reason we have two vaccines in late-stage clinical trials now, is actually because of a somewhat misguided fear. Ebola was relatively ignored until September 11 and the anthrax attacks, when all of a sudden, people perceived Ebola as, potentially, a bioterrorism weapon.Why is it that the Ebola vaccine wasn't fully developed at this point? Well, partially, because it was really difficult \u2014 or thought to be difficult \u2014 to weaponize the virus, but mainly because of the financial risk in developing it. And this is really the point. The sad reality is, we develop vaccines not based upon the risk the pathogen poses to people, but on how economically risky it is to develop these vaccines. Vaccine development is expensive and complicated. It can cost hundreds of millions of dollars to take even a well-known antigen and turn it into a viable vaccine.Fortunately for diseases like Ebola, there are things we can do to remove some of these barriers. The first is to recognize when there's a complete market failure. In that case, if we want vaccines, we have to provide incentives or some type of subsidy. We also need to do a better job at being able to figure out which are the diseases that most threaten us. By creating capabilities within countries, we then create the ability for those countries to create epidemiological and laboratory networks which are capable of collecting and categorizing these pathogens. The data from that then can be used to understand the geographic and genetic diversity, which then can be used to help us understand how these are being changed immunologically, and what type of reactions they promote.So these are the things that can be done, but to do this, if we want to deal with a complete market failure, we have to change the way we view and prevent infectious diseases. We have to stop waiting until we see evidence of a disease becoming a global threat before we consider it as one. So, for Ebola, the paranoid fear of an infectious disease, followed by a few cases transported to wealthy countries, led the global community to come together, and with the work of dedicated vaccine companies, we now have these: Two Ebola vaccines in efficacy trials in the Ebola countries \u2014(Applause)and a pipeline of vaccines that are following behind.Every year, we spend billions of dollars, keeping a fleet of nuclear submarines permanently patrolling the oceans to protect us from a threat that almost certainly will never happen. And yet, we spend virtually nothing to prevent something as tangible and evolutionarily certain as epidemic infectious diseases. And make no mistake about it \u2014 it's not a question of \"if,\" but \"when.\" These bugs are going to continue to evolve and they're going to threaten the world. And vaccines are our best defense. So if we want to be able to prevent epidemics like Ebola, we need to take on the risk of investing in vaccine development and in stockpile creation. And we need to view this, then, as the ultimate deterrent \u2014 something we make sure is available, but at the same time, praying we never have to use it.Thank you.(Applause)", "id": 2317,

provide incentives\nor some type of subsidy.\n\n00:04:36.155 --> 00:04:40.495\nWe also need to do a better job\nat being able to figure out\n\n00:04:40.519 --> 00:04:42.877\nwhich are the diseases\nthat most threaten us.\n\n00:04:43.218 --> 00:04:48.133\nBy creating capabilities within countries,\nwe then create the ability\n\n00:04:48.157 --> 00:04:52.774\nfor those countries to create\nepidemiological and laboratory networks\n\n00:04:52.798 --> 00:04:57.067\nwhich are capable of collecting\nand categorizing these pathogens.\n\n00:04:58.075 --> 00:05:00.337\nThe data from that then can be used\n\n00:05:00.361 --> 00:05:03.640\nto understand the geographic\nand genetic diversity,\n\n00:05:03.664 --> 00:05:06.300\nwhich then can be used\nto help us understand\n\n00:05:06.324 --> 00:05:09.967\nhow these are being changed\nimmunologically,\n\n00:05:09.991 --> 00:05:12.315\nand what type of reactions they promote.\n\n00:05:13.156 --> 00:05:15.483\nSo these are the things that can be done,\n\n00:05:15.507 --> 00:05:19.191\nbut to do this, if we want to deal\nwith a complete market failure,\n\n00:05:19.215 --> 00:05:24.639\nwe have to change the way\nwe view and prevent infectious diseases.\n\n00:05:24.663 --> 00:05:28.850\nWe have to stop waiting\nuntil we see evidence\n\n00:05:28.874 --> 00:05:33.678\nof a disease becoming a global threat\nbefore we consider it as one.\n\n00:05:34.575 --> 00:05:36.814\nSo, for Ebola,\n\n00:05:36.838 --> 00:05:40.729\nthe paranoid fear\nof an infectious disease,\n\n00:05:40.753 --> 00:05:45.475\nfollowed by a few cases\ntransported to wealthy countries,\n\n00:05:45.499 --> 00:05:48.099\nled the global community to come together,\n\n00:05:48.123 --> 00:05:51.628\nand with the work\nof dedicated vaccine companies,\n\n00:05:51.652 --> 00:05:53.318\nwe now have these:\n\n00:05:54.423 --> 00:06:00.430\nTwo Ebola vaccines in efficacy trials\nin the Ebola countries --\n\n00:06:00.454 --> 00:06:05.959\n(Applause)\n\n00:06:05.983 --> 00:06:09.967\nand a pipeline of vaccines\nthat are following behind.\n\n00:06:10.721 --> 00:06:13.813\nEvery year, we spend billions of dollars,\n\n00:06:13.837 --> 00:06:18.910\nkeeping a fleet of nuclear submarines\npermanently patrolling the oceans\n\n00:06:18.934 --> 00:06:22.925\nto protect us from a threat\nthat almost certainly will never happen.\n\n00:06:23.485 --> 00:06:26.421\nAnd yet, we spend virtually nothing\n\n00:06:26.445 --> 00:06:31.472\nto prevent something as tangible\nand evolutionarily certain\n\n00:06:31.496 --> 00:06:33.674\nas epidemic infectious diseases.\n\n00:06:34.967 --> 00:06:38.862\nAnd make no mistake about it --\nit's not a question of \"if,\" but \"when.\"\n\n00:06:38.886 --> 00:06:41.798\nThese bugs are going to continue to evolve\n\n00:06:41.822 --> 00:06:43.825\nand they're going to threaten the world.\n\n00:06:44.238 --> 00:06:46.582\nAnd vaccines are our best defense.\n\n00:06:47.066 --> 00:06:51.375\nSo if we want to be able to prevent\nepidemics like Ebola,\n\n00:06:51.399 --> 00:06:55.845\nwe need to take on the risk\nof investing in vaccine development\n\n00:06:55.869 --> 00:06:57.907\nand in stockpile creation.\n\n00:06:58.718 --> 00:07:02.343\nAnd we need to view this, then,\nas the ultimate deterrent --\n\n00:07:02.367 --> 00:07:05.487\nsomething we make sure is available,\n\n00:07:05.511 --> 00:07:09.150\nbut at the same time,\npraying we never have to use it.\n\n00:07:09.579 --> 00:07:10.730\nThank you.\n\n00:07:10.754 --> 00:07:15.032\n(Applause)"}, {"title": "These robots come to the rescue after a disaster", "duration": "539", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/robin_murphy_these_robots_come_to_the_rescue_after_a_disaster", "transcript": "Over a million people are killed each year in disasters. Two and a half million people will be permanently disabled or displaced, and the communities will take 20 to 30 years to recover and billions of economic losses.If you can reduce the initial response by one day, you can reduce the overall recovery by a thousand days, or three years. See how that works? If the initial responders can get in, save lives, mitigate whatever flooding danger there is, that means the other groups can get in to restore the water, the roads, the electricity, which means then the construction people, the insurance agents, all of them can get in to rebuild the houses, which then means you can restore the economy, and maybe even make it better and more resilient to the next disaster. A major insurance company told me that if they can get a homeowner's claim processed one day earlier, it'll make a difference of six months in that person getting their home repaired.And that's why I do disaster robotics \u2014 because robots can make a disaster go away faster.Now, you've already seen a couple of these. These are the UAVs. These are two types of UAVs: a rotorcraft, or hummingbird; a fixed-wing, a hawk. And they're used extensively since 2005 \u2014 Hurricane Katrina. Let me show you how this hummingbird, this rotorcraft, works. Fantastic for structural engineers. Being able to see damage from angles you can't get from binoculars on the ground or from a satellite image, or anything flying at a higher angle. But it's not just structural engineers and insurance people who need this. You've got things like this fixed-wing, this hawk. Now, this hawk can be used for geospatial surveys. That's where you're pulling imagery together and getting 3D reconstruction.We used both of these at the Oso mudslides up in Washington State, because the big problem was geospatial and hydrological understanding of the disaster \u2014 not the search and rescue. The search and rescue teams had it under control and knew what they were doing. The bigger problem was that river and mudslide might wipe them out and flood the responders. And not only was it challenging to the responders and property damage, it's also putting at risk the future of salmon fishing along that part of Washington State. So they needed to understand what was going on. In seven hours, going from Arlington, driving from the Incident Command Post to the site, flying the UAVs, processing the data, driving back to Arlington command post \u2014 seven hours. We gave them in seven hours data that they could take only two to three days to get any other way \u2014 and at higher resolution. It's a game changer.And don't just think about the UAVs. I mean, they are sexy \u2014 but remember, 80 percent of the world's population lives by water, and that means our critical infrastructure is underwater \u2014 the parts that we can't get to, like the bridges and things like that. And that's why we have unmanned marine vehicles, one type of which you've already met, which is SARbot, a square dolphin. It goes underwater and uses sonar. Well, why are marine vehicles so important and why are they very, very important? They get overlooked. Think about the Japanese tsunami \u2014 400 miles of coastland totally devastated, twice the amount of coastland devastated by Hurricane Katrina in the United States. You're talking about your bridges, your pipelines, your ports \u2014 wiped out. And if you don't have a port, you don't have a way to get in enough relief supplies to support a population. That was a huge problem at the Haiti earthquake. So we need marine vehicles.Now, let's look at a viewpoint from the SARbot of what they were seeing. We were working on a fishing port. We were able to reopen that fishing port, using her sonar, in four hours. That fishing port was told it was going to be six months before they could get a manual team of divers in, and it was going to take the divers two weeks. They were going to miss the fall fishing season, which was the major economy for that part, which is kind of like their Cape Cod. UMVs, very important.But you know, all the robots I've shown you have been small, and that's because robots don't do things that people do. They go places people can't go. And a great example of that is Bujold. Unmanned ground vehicles are particularly small, so Bujold \u2014(Laughter)Say hello to Bujold.(Laughter)Bujold was used extensively at the World Trade Center to go through Towers 1, 2 and 4. You're climbing into the rubble, rappelling down, going deep in spaces. And just to see the World Trade Center from Bujold's viewpoint, look at this. You're talking about a disaster where you can't fit a person or a dog \u2014 and it's on fire. The only hope of getting to a survivor way in the basement, you have to go through things that are on fire. It was so hot, on one of the robots, the tracks began to melt and come off. Robots don't replace people or dogs, or hummingbirds or hawks or dolphins. They do things new. They assist the responders, the experts, in new and innovative ways.The biggest problem is not making the robots smaller, though. It's not making them more heat-resistant. It's not making more sensors. The biggest problem is the data, the informatics, because these people need to get the right data at the right time.So wouldn't it be great if we could have experts immediately access the robots without having to waste any time of driving to the site, so whoever's there, use their robots over the Internet. Well, let's think about that. Let's think about a chemical train derailment in a rural county. What are the odds that the experts, your chemical engineer, your railroad transportation engineers, have been trained on whatever UAV that particular county happens to have? Probably, like, none. So we're using these kinds of interfaces to allow people to use the robots without knowing what robot they're using, or even if they're using a robot or not. What the robots give you, what they give the experts, is data.The problem becomes: who gets what data when? One thing to do is to ship all the information to everybody and let them sort it out. Well, the problem with that is it overwhelms the networks, and worse yet, it overwhelms the cognitive abilities of each of the people trying to get that one nugget of information they need to make the decision that's going to make the difference. So we need to think about those kinds of challenges. So it's the data.Going back to the World Trade Center, we tried to solve that problem by just recording the data from Bujold only when she was deep in the rubble, because that's what the USAR team said they wanted. What we didn't know at the time was that the civil engineers would have loved, needed the data as we recorded the box beams, the serial numbers, the locations, as we went into the rubble. We lost valuable data. So the challenge is getting all the data and getting it to the right people.Now, here's another reason. We've learned that some buildings \u2014 things like schools, hospitals, city halls \u2014 get inspected four times by different agencies throughout the response phases. Now, we're looking, if we can get the data from the robots to share, not only can we do things like compress that sequence of phases to shorten the response time, but now we can begin to do the response in parallel. Everybody can see the data. We can shorten it that way.So really, \"disaster robotics\" is a misnomer. It's not about the robots. It's about the data.(Applause)So my challenge to you: the next time you hear about a disaster, look for the robots. They may be underground, they may be underwater, they may be in the sky, but they should be there. Look for the robots, because robots are coming to the rescue.(Applause)", "id": 2318, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:12.957 --> 00:00:17.933\nOver a

that's because robots\ndon't do things that people do.\n\n00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:47.933\nThey go places people can't go.\n\n00:04:47.957 --> 00:04:50.933\nAnd a great example of that is Bujold.\n\n00:04:50.957 --> 00:04:53.933\nUnmanned ground vehicles\nare particularly small,\n\n00:04:53.957 --> 00:04:55.275\nso Bujold --\n\n00:04:55.299 --> 00:04:56.807\n(Laughter)\n\n00:04:56.831 --> 00:04:58.014\nSay hello to Bujold.\n\n00:04:58.038 --> 00:05:00.722\n(Laughter)\n\n00:05:01.564 --> 00:05:04.933\nBujold was used extensively\nat the World Trade Center\n\n00:05:04.957 --> 00:05:07.337\nto go through Towers 1, 2 and 4.\n\n00:05:07.361 --> 00:05:12.006\nYou're climbing into the rubble,\nrappelling down, going deep in spaces.\n\n00:05:12.030 --> 00:05:16.589\nAnd just to see the World Trade Center\nfrom Bujold's viewpoint, look at this.\n\n00:05:16.613 --> 00:05:21.682\nYou're talking about a disaster\nwhere you can't fit a person or a dog --\n\n00:05:21.706 --> 00:05:23.848\nand it's on fire.\n\n00:05:23.872 --> 00:05:27.606\nThe only hope of getting\nto a survivor way in the basement,\n\n00:05:27.630 --> 00:05:29.825\nyou have to go through things\nthat are on fire.\n\n00:05:29.849 --> 00:05:34.353\nIt was so hot, on one of the robots,\nthe tracks began to melt and come off.\n\n00:05:35.119 --> 00:05:37.907\nRobots don't replace people or dogs,\n\n00:05:37.931 --> 00:05:40.452\nor hummingbirds or hawks or dolphins.\n\n00:05:40.476 --> 00:05:42.512\nThey do things new.\n\n00:05:42.536 --> 00:05:48.225\nThey assist the responders,\nthe experts, in new and innovative ways.\n\n00:05:48.249 --> 00:05:52.678\nThe biggest problem is not\nmaking the robots smaller, though.\n\n00:05:52.702 --> 00:05:54.933\nIt's not making them more heat-resistant.\n\n00:05:54.957 --> 00:05:56.714\nIt's not making more sensors.\n\n00:05:56.738 --> 00:06:00.348\nThe biggest problem is the data,\nthe informatics,\n\n00:06:00.372 --> 00:06:04.408\nbecause these people need to get\nthe right data at the right time.\n\n00:06:04.432 --> 00:06:09.933\nSo wouldn't it be great if we could have\nexperts immediately access the robots\n\n00:06:09.957 --> 00:06:12.933\nwithout having to waste any time\nof driving to the site,\n\n00:06:12.957 --> 00:06:15.890\nso whoever's there,\nuse their robots over the Internet.\n\n00:06:15.914 --> 00:06:17.296\nWell, let's think about that.\n\n00:06:17.320 --> 00:06:20.692\nLet's think about a chemical\ntrain derailment in a rural county.\n\n00:06:20.716 --> 00:06:24.558\nWhat are the odds that the experts,\nyour chemical engineer,\n\n00:06:24.582 --> 00:06:26.444\nyour railroad transportation engineers,\n\n00:06:26.468 --> 00:06:31.329\nhave been trained on whatever UAV\nthat particular county happens to have?\n\n00:06:31.353 --> 00:06:32.886\nProbably, like, none.\n\n00:06:32.910 --> 00:06:35.300\nSo we're using these kinds of interfaces\n\n00:06:35.324 --> 00:06:39.664\nto allow people to use the robots\nwithout knowing what robot they're using,\n\n00:06:39.688 --> 00:06:42.474\nor even if they're using a robot or not.\n\n00:06:44.210 --> 00:06:50.244\nWhat the robots give you,\nwhat they give the experts, is data.\n\n00:06:50.268 --> 00:06:53.848\nThe problem becomes:\nwho gets what data when?\n\n00:06:53.872 --> 00:06:57.765\nOne thing to do is to ship\nall the information to everybody\n\n00:06:57.789 --> 00:06:59.301\nand let them sort it out.\n\n00:06:59.325 --> 00:07:03.181\nWell, the problem with that\nis it overwhelms the networks,\n\n00:07:03.205 --> 00:07:06.891\nand worse yet, it overwhelms\nthe cognitive abilities\n\n00:07:06.915 --> 00:07:11.424\nof each of the people trying to get\nthat one nugget of information\n\n00:07:11.448 --> 00:07:15.253\nthey need to make the decision\nthat's going to make the difference.\n\n00:07:15.957 --> 00:07:19.051\nSo we need to think\nabout those kinds of challenges.\n\n00:07:19.075 --> 00:07:20.340\nSo it's the data.\n\n00:07:20.364 --> 00:07:22.600\nGoing back to the World Trade Center,\n\n00:07:22.624 --> 00:07:26.933\nwe tried to solve that problem\nby just recording the data from Bujold\n\n00:07:26.957 --> 00:07:28.933\nonly when she was deep in the rubble,\n\n00:07:28.957 --> 00:07:31.521\nbecause that's what the USAR team\nsaid they wanted.\n\n00:07:32.481 --> 00:07:35.069\nWhat we didn't know at the time\n\n00:07:35.093 --> 00:07:37.691\nwas that the civil engineers\nwould have loved,\n\n00:07:37.715 --> 00:07:41.933\nneeded the data as we recorded\nthe box beams, the serial numbers,\n\n00:07:41.957 --> 00:07:44.576\nthe locations, as we went into the rubble.\n\n00:07:45.301 --> 00:07:46.768\nWe lost valuable data.\n\n00:07:46.792 --> 00:07:49.171\nSo the challenge is getting all the data\n\n00:07:49.195 --> 00:07:51.375\nand getting it to the right people.\n\n00:07:51.399 --> 00:07:53.476\nNow, here's another reason.\n\n00:07:53.500 --> 00:07:55.811\nWe've learned that some buildings --\n\n00:07:55.835 --> 00:07:59.107\nthings like schools,\nhospitals, city halls --\n\n00:07:59.131 --> 00:08:03.150\nget inspected four times\nby different agencies\n\n00:08:03.174 --> 00:08:05.424\nthroughout the response phases.\n\n00:08:06.114 --> 00:08:09.383\nNow, we're looking, if we can get\nthe data from the robots to share,\n\n00:08:09.407 --> 00:08:14.257\nnot only can we do things like\ncompress that sequence of phases\n\n00:08:14.281 --> 00:08:15.934\nto shorten the response time,\n\n00:08:15.958 --> 00:08:20.316\nbut now we can begin\nto do the response in parallel.\n\n00:08:20.340 --> 00:08:21.719\nEverybody can see the data.\n\n00:08:21.743 --> 00:08:23.205\nWe can shorten it that way.\n\n00:08:23.957 --> 00:08:27.363\nSo really, \"disaster robotics\"\nis a misnomer.\n\n00:08:28.185 --> 00:08:30.080\nIt's not about the robots.\n\n00:08:30.104 --> 00:08:31.986\nIt's about the data.\n\n00:08:32.391 --> 00:08:35.721\n(Applause)\n\n00:08:35.745 --> 00:08:37.702\nSo my challenge to you:\n\n00:08:37.726 --> 00:08:40.026\nthe next time you hear about a disaster,\n\n00:08:40.050 --> 00:08:41.375\nlook for the robots.\n\n00:08:41.399 --> 00:08:44.524\nThey may be underground,\nthey may be underwater,\n\n00:08:44.548 --> 00:08:46.242\nthey may be in the sky,\n\n00:08:46.266 --> 00:08:48.231\nbut they should be there.\n\n00:08:48.255 --> 00:08:49.422\nLook for the robots,\n\n00:08:49.446 --> 00:08:52.193\nbecause robots are coming to the rescue.\n\n00:08:52.217 --> 00:08:57.878\n(Applause)"}, {"title": "How too many rules at work keep you from getting things done", "duration": "998", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/yves_morieux_how_too_many_rules_at_work_keep_you_from_getting_things_done", "transcript": "Paul Krugman, the Nobel Prize [winner] in economics, once wrote: \"Productivity is not everything, but in the long run, it is almost everything.\"So this is serious. There are not that many things on earth that are \"almost everything.\" Productivity is the principal driver of the prosperity of a society. So we have a problem. In the largest European economies, productivity used to grow five percent per annum in the '50s, '60s, early '70s. From '73 to '83: three percent per annum. From '83 to '95: two percent per annum. Since 1995: less than one percent per annum. The same profile in Japan. The same profile in the US, despite a momentary rebound 15 years ago, and despite all the technological innovations around us: the Internet, the information, the new information and communication technologies.When productivity grows three percent per annum, you double the standard of living every generation. Every generation is twice as well-off as its parents'. When it grows one percent per annum, it takes three generations to double the standard of living. And in this process, many people will be less well-off than their parents. They will have less of everything: smaller roofs, or perhaps no roof at all, less access to education, to vitamins, to antibiotics, to vaccination \u2014 to everything. Think of all the problems that we're facing at the moment. All. Chances are that they are rooted in the productivity crisis.Why this crisis? Because the basic tenets about efficiency \u2014 effectiveness in organizations, in management \u2014 have become counterproductive for human efforts. Everywhere in public services \u2014 in companies, in the way we work, the way we innovate, invest \u2014 try to learn to work better. Take the holy trinity of efficiency: clarity, measurement, accountability. They make human efforts derail.There are two ways to look at it, to prove it. One, the one I prefer, is rigorous, elegant, nice \u2014 math. But the full math version takes a little while, so there is another one. It is to look at a relay race. This is what we will do today. It's a bit more animated, more visual and also faster \u2014 it's a race. Hopefully, it's faster.(Laughter)World championship final \u2014 women. Eight teams in the final. The fastest team is the US team. They have the fastest women on earth. They are the favorite team to win. Notably, if you compare them to an average team, say, the French team,(Laughter)based on their best performances in the 100-meter race, if you add the individual times of the US runners, they arrive at the finish line 3.2 meters ahead of the French team. And this year, the US team is in great shape. Based on their best performance this year, they arrive 6.4 meters ahead of the French team, based on the data. We are going to look at the race. At some point you will see, towards the end, that Torri Edwards, the fourth US runner, is ahead. Not surprising \u2014 this year she got the gold medal in the 100-meter race. And by the way, Chryste Gaines, the second runner in the US team, is the fastest woman on earth. So, there are 3.5 billion women on earth. Where are the two fastest? On the US team. And the two other runners on the US team are not bad, either.(Laughter)So clearly, the US team has won the war for talent. But behind, the average team is trying to catch up. Let's watch the race.(Video: French sportscasters narrate race)(Video: Race narration ends)Yves Morieux: So what happened? The fastest team did not win; the slower one did. By the way, I hope you appreciate the deep historical research I did to make the French look good.(Laughter)But let's not exaggerate \u2014 it's not archeology, either.(Laughter)But why? Because of cooperation. When you hear this sentence: \"Thanks to cooperation, the whole is worth more than the sum of the parts.\" This is not poetry; this is not philosophy. This is math. Those who carry the baton are slower, but their baton is faster. Miracle of cooperation: it multiplies energy, intelligence in human efforts. It is the essence of human efforts: how we work together, how each effort contributes to the efforts of others. With cooperation, we can do more with less.Now, what happens to cooperation when the holy grail \u2014 the holy trinity, even \u2014 of clarity, measurement, accountability \u2014 appears?Clarity. Management reports are full of complaints about the lack of clarity. Compliance audits, consultants' diagnostics. We need more clarity, we need to clarify the roles, the processes. It is as though the runners on the team were saying, \"Let's be clear \u2014 where does my role really start and end? Am I supposed to run for 95 meters, 96, 97...?\" It's important, let's be clear. If you say 97, after 97 meters, people will drop the baton, whether there is someone to take it or not.Accountability. We are constantly trying to put accountability in someone's hands. Who is accountable for this process? We need somebody accountable for this process. So in the relay race, since passing the baton is so important, then we need somebody clearly accountable for passing the baton. So between each runner, now we will have a new dedicated athlete, clearly dedicated to taking the baton from one runner, and passing it to the next runner. And we will have at least two like that. Well, will we, in that case, win the race? That I don't know, but for sure, we would have a clear interface, a clear line of accountability. We will know who to blame. But we'll never win the race. If you think about it, we pay more attention to knowing who to blame in case we fail, than to creating the conditions to succeed. All the human intelligence put in organization design \u2014 urban structures, processing systems \u2014 what is the real goal? To have somebody guilty in case they fail. We are creating organizations able to fail, but in a compliant way, with somebody clearly accountable when we fail. And we are quite effective at that \u2014 failing.Measurement. What gets measured gets done. Look, to pass the baton, you have to do it at the right time, in the right hand, at the right speed. But to do that, you have to put energy in your arm. This energy that is in your arm will not be in your legs. It will come at the expense of your measurable speed. You have to shout early enough to the next runner when you will pass the baton, to signal that you are arriving, so that the next runner can prepare, can anticipate. And you have to shout loud. But the blood, the energy that will be in your throat will not be in your legs. Because you know, there are eight people shouting at the same time. So you have to recognize the voice of your colleague. You cannot say, \"Is it you?\" Too late!(Laughter)Now, let's look at the race in slow motion, and concentrate on the third runner. Look at where she allocates her efforts, her energy, her attention. Not all in her legs \u2014 that would be great for her own speed \u2014 but in also in her throat, arm, eye, brain. That makes a difference in whose legs? In the legs of the next runner. But when the next runner runs super-fast, is it because she made a super effort, or because of the way the third runner passed the baton? There is no metric on earth that will give us the answer. And if we reward people on the basis of their measurable performance, they will put their energy, their attention, their blood in what can get measured \u2014 in their legs. And the baton will fall and slow down.To cooperate is not a super effort, it is how you allocate your effort. It is to take a risk, because you sacrifice the ultimate protection granted by objectively measurable individual performance. It is to make a super difference in the performance of others, with whom we are compared. It takes being stupid to cooperate, then. And people are not stupid; they don't cooperate.You know, clarity, accountability, measurement were OK when the world was simpler. But business has become much more complex. With my teams, we have measured the evolution of complexity in business. It is much more demanding today to attract and retain customers, to build advantage on a global scale, to create value. And the more business gets complex, the more, in the name of clarity, accountability, measurement we multiply structures, processes, systems.You know, this drive for clarity and accountability triggers a counterproductive multiplication of interfaces, middle offices, coordinators that do not only mobilize people and resources, but that also add obstacles. And the more complicated the organization, the more difficult it is to understand what is really happening. So we need summaries, proxies, reports, key performance indicators, metrics. So people put their energy in what can get measured, at the expense of cooperation. And as performance deteriorates, we add even more structure, process, systems. People spend their time in meetings, writing reports they have to do, undo and redo. Based on our analysis, teams in these organizations spend between 40 and 80 percent of their time wasting their time, but working harder and harder, longer and longer, on less and less value-adding activities. This is what is killing productivity, what makes people suffer at work.Our organizations are wasting human intelligence. They have turned against human efforts. When people don't cooperate, don't blame their mindsets, their mentalities, their personality \u2014 look at the work situations. Is it really in their personal interest to cooperate or not, if, when they cooperate, they are individually worse off? Why would they cooperate? When we blame personalities instead of the clarity, the accountability, the measurement, we add injustice to ineffectiveness.We need to create organizations in which it becomes individually useful for people to cooperate. Remove the interfaces, the middle offices \u2014 all these complicated coordination structures. Don't look for clarity; go for fuzziness. Fuzziness overlaps. Remove most of the quantitative metrics to assess performance. Speed the \"what.\" Look at cooperation, the \"how.\" How did you pass the baton? Did you throw it, or did you pass it effectively? Am I putting my energy in what can get measured \u2014 my legs, my speed \u2014 or in passing the baton?You, as leaders, as managers, are you making it individually useful for people to cooperate? The future of our organizations, our companies, our societies hinges on your answer to these questions.Thank you.(Applause)", "id": 2321, "subtitle":

00:03:32.123\nIt is to look at a relay race.\n\n00:03:32.655 --> 00:03:34.323\nThis is what we will do today.\n\n00:03:34.347 --> 00:03:40.697\nIt's a bit more animated, more visual\nand also faster -- it's a race.\n\n00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:42.824\nHopefully, it's faster.\n\n00:03:42.848 --> 00:03:44.212\n(Laughter)\n\n00:03:44.236 --> 00:03:49.194\nWorld championship final -- women.\n\n00:03:49.218 --> 00:03:51.329\nEight teams in the final.\n\n00:03:51.353 --> 00:03:54.158\nThe fastest team is the US team.\n\n00:03:55.087 --> 00:03:57.754\nThey have the fastest women on earth.\n\n00:03:58.111 --> 00:04:00.886\nThey are the favorite team to win.\n\n00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:05.100\nNotably, if you compare them\nto an average team,\n\n00:04:05.124 --> 00:04:06.498\nsay, the French team,\n\n00:04:06.522 --> 00:04:08.109\n(Laughter)\n\n00:04:08.133 --> 00:04:13.328\nbased on their best performances\nin the 100-meter race,\n\n00:04:13.352 --> 00:04:19.121\nif you add the individual times\nof the US runners,\n\n00:04:19.145 --> 00:04:26.057\nthey arrive at the finish line\n3.2 meters ahead of the French team.\n\n00:04:26.396 --> 00:04:29.420\nAnd this year, the US team\nis in great shape.\n\n00:04:29.992 --> 00:04:32.378\nBased on their best performance this year,\n\n00:04:32.402 --> 00:04:37.307\nthey arrive 6.4 meters\nahead of the French team,\n\n00:04:37.331 --> 00:04:38.696\nbased on the data.\n\n00:04:39.232 --> 00:04:40.811\nWe are going to look at the race.\n\n00:04:40.835 --> 00:04:43.258\nAt some point you will see,\ntowards the end,\n\n00:04:43.282 --> 00:04:49.588\nthat Torri Edwards,\nthe fourth US runner, is ahead.\n\n00:04:49.612 --> 00:04:56.101\nNot surprising -- this year she got\nthe gold medal in the 100-meter race.\n\n00:04:56.125 --> 00:05:01.067\nAnd by the way, Chryste Gaines,\nthe second runner in the US team,\n\n00:05:01.091 --> 00:05:03.728\nis the fastest woman on earth.\n\n00:05:03.752 --> 00:05:08.905\nSo, there are 3.5 billion women on earth.\n\n00:05:09.848 --> 00:05:13.021\nWhere are the two fastest? On the US team.\n\n00:05:13.045 --> 00:05:16.318\nAnd the two other runners\non the US team are not bad, either.\n\n00:05:16.342 --> 00:05:18.058\n(Laughter)\n\n00:05:18.082 --> 00:05:22.753\nSo clearly, the US team has won\nthe war for talent.\n\n00:05:24.349 --> 00:05:28.330\nBut behind, the average team\nis trying to catch up.\n\n00:05:28.354 --> 00:05:29.703\nLet's watch the race.\n\n00:05:30.258 --> 00:05:35.283\n(Video: French sportscasters narrate race)\n\n00:06:18.844 --> 00:06:20.844\n(Video: Race narration ends)\n\n00:06:22.070 --> 00:06:23.565\nYves Morieux: So what happened?\n\n00:06:23.589 --> 00:06:28.000\nThe fastest team did not win;\nthe slower one did.\n\n00:06:28.767 --> 00:06:30.704\nBy the way, I hope you appreciate\n\n00:06:30.728 --> 00:06:36.654\nthe deep historical research I did\nto make the French look good.\n\n00:06:36.678 --> 00:06:38.973\n(Laughter)\n\n00:06:41.443 --> 00:06:45.862\nBut let's not exaggerate --\nit's not archeology, either.\n\n00:06:45.886 --> 00:06:47.867\n(Laughter)\n\n00:06:47.891 --> 00:06:49.057\nBut why?\n\n00:06:49.081 --> 00:06:50.621\nBecause of cooperation.\n\n00:06:50.645 --> 00:06:52.479\nWhen you hear this sentence:\n\n00:06:52.503 --> 00:06:56.904\n\"Thanks to cooperation, the whole\nis worth more than the sum of the parts.\"\n\n00:06:57.665 --> 00:07:00.980\nThis is not poetry;\nthis is not philosophy.\n\n00:07:01.004 --> 00:07:02.519\nThis is math.\n\n00:07:03.154 --> 00:07:06.434\nThose who carry the baton are slower,\n\n00:07:06.458 --> 00:07:08.155\nbut their baton is faster.\n\n00:07:08.806 --> 00:07:10.441\nMiracle of cooperation:\n\n00:07:11.015 --> 00:07:16.295\nit multiplies energy,\nintelligence in human efforts.\n\n00:07:16.319 --> 00:07:19.294\nIt is the essence of human efforts:\n\n00:07:19.318 --> 00:07:25.134\nhow we work together, how each effort\ncontributes to the efforts of others.\n\n00:07:25.975 --> 00:07:29.223\nWith cooperation,\nwe can do more with less.\n\n00:07:29.746 --> 00:07:35.294\nNow, what happens to cooperation\nwhen the holy grail --\n\n00:07:35.318 --> 00:07:37.756\nthe holy trinity, even --\n\n00:07:37.780 --> 00:07:44.001\nof clarity, measurement, accountability --\n\n00:07:44.025 --> 00:07:45.194\nappears?\n\n00:07:46.910 --> 00:07:48.062\nClarity.\n\n00:07:48.086 --> 00:07:52.667\nManagement reports are full of complaints\nabout the lack of clarity.\n\n00:07:53.382 --> 00:07:57.099\nCompliance audits,\nconsultants' diagnostics.\n\n00:07:58.448 --> 00:08:02.980\nWe need more clarity, we need\nto clarify the roles, the processes.\n\n00:08:04.050 --> 00:08:08.066\nIt is as though the runners\non the team were saying,\n\n00:08:08.090 --> 00:08:14.038\n\"Let's be clear -- where does my role\nreally start and end?\n\n00:08:14.896 --> 00:08:19.728\nAm I supposed to run for 95 meters,\n96, 97...?\"\n\n00:08:19.752 --> 00:08:21.542\nIt's important, let's be clear.\n\n00:08:22.843 --> 00:08:25.849\nIf you say 97, after 97 meters,\n\n00:08:25.873 --> 00:08:29.405\npeople will drop the baton, whether\nthere is someone to take it or not.\n\n00:08:31.103 --> 00:08:32.325\nAccountability.\n\n00:08:33.042 --> 00:08:36.492\nWe are constantly trying\nto put accountability\n\n00:08:36.516 --> 00:08:38.089\nin someone's hands.\n\n00:08:38.517 --> 00:08:41.090\nWho is accountable for this process?\n\n00:08:41.114 --> 00:08:44.235\nWe need somebody accountable\nfor this process.\n\n00:08:44.592 --> 00:08:49.053\nSo in the relay race,\nsince passing the baton is so important,\n\n00:08:49.077 --> 00:08:52.824\nthen we need somebody\nclearly accountable for passing the baton.\n\n00:08:53.744 --> 00:08:55.923\nSo between each runner,\n\n00:08:55.947 --> 00:09:00.671\nnow we will have a new dedicated athlete,\n\n00:09:00.695 --> 00:09:05.240\nclearly dedicated to taking\nthe baton from one runner,\n\n00:09:05.264 --> 00:09:07.560\nand passing it to the next runner.\n\n00:09:08.242 --> 00:09:10.751\nAnd we will have at least two like that.\n\n00:09:12.339 --> 00:09:18.799\nWell, will we, in that case, win the race?\n\n00:09:19.861 --> 00:09:21.862\nThat I don't know, but for sure,\n\n00:09:21.886 --> 00:09:25.156\nwe would have a clear interface,\n\n00:09:25.180 --> 00:09:27.824\na clear line of accountability.\n\n00:09:27.848 --> 00:09:29.776\nWe will know who to blame.\n\n00:09:30.792 --> 00:09:33.033\nBut we'll never win the race.\n\n00:09:33.057 --> 00:09:38.044\nIf you think about it,\nwe pay more attention\n\n00:09:38.068 --> 00:09:42.223\nto knowing who to blame in case we fail,\n\n00:09:42.247 --> 00:09:45.968\nthan to creating\nthe conditions to succeed.\n\n00:09:47.342 --> 00:09:50.705\nAll the human intelligence\nput in organization design --\n\n00:09:50.729 --> 00:09:53.514\nurban structures, processing systems --\n\n00:09:53.538 --> 00:09:55.162\nwhat is the real goal?\n\n00:09:56.305 --> 00:09:59.235\nTo have somebody guilty in case they fail.\n\n00:10:00.457 --> 00:10:05.344\nWe are creating\norganizations able to fail,\n\n00:10:05.368 --> 00:10:08.345\nbut in a compliant way,\n\n00:10:08.369 --> 00:10:11.811\nwith somebody clearly\naccountable when we fail.\n\n00:10:11.835 --> 00:10:15.659\nAnd we are quite effective\nat that -- failing.\n\n00:10:16.850 --> 00:10:18.011\nMeasurement.\n\n00:10:18.632 --> 00:10:20.060\nWhat gets measured gets done.\n\n00:10:20.084 --> 00:10:24.475\nLook, to pass the baton,\nyou have to do it at the right time,\n\n00:10:24.499 --> 00:10:26.974\nin the right hand, at the right speed.\n\n00:10:27.415 --> 00:10:29.974\nBut to do that, you have to put\nenergy in your arm.\n\n00:10:29.998 --> 00:10:32.989\nThis energy that is in your arm\nwill not be in your legs.\n\n00:10:33.449 --> 00:10:36.428\nIt will come at the expense\nof your measurable speed.\n\n00:10:37.325 --> 00:10:40.778\nYou have to shout early enough\nto the next runner\n\n00:10:40.802 --> 00:10:44.113\nwhen you will pass the baton,\nto signal that you are arriving,\n\n00:10:44.137 --> 00:10:47.342\nso that the next runner\ncan prepare, can anticipate.\n\n00:10:47.366 --> 00:10:49.529\nAnd you have to shout loud.\n\n00:10:50.140 --> 00:10:54.113\nBut the blood, the energy\nthat will be in your throat\n\n00:10:54.137 --> 00:10:55.537\nwill not be in your legs.\n\n00:10:55.561 --> 00:10:59.317\nBecause you know, there are\neight people shouting at the same time.\n\n00:10:59.341 --> 00:11:01.980\nSo you have to recognize the voice\nof your colleague.\n\n00:11:02.330 --> 00:11:04.083\nYou cannot say, \"Is it you?\"\n\n00:11:04.528 --> 00:11:05.682\nToo late!\n\n00:11:05.706 --> 00:11:06.912\n(Laughter)\n\n00:11:06.936 --> 00:11:11.912\nNow, let's look at the race\nin slow motion,\n\n00:11:11.936 --> 00:11:14.484\nand concentrate on the third runner.\n\n00:11:14.508 --> 00:11:18.931\nLook at where she allocates her efforts,\n\n00:11:18.955 --> 00:11:21.662\nher energy, her attention.\n\n00:11:22.836 --> 00:11:25.980\nNot all in her legs -- that would\nbe great for her own speed --\n\n00:11:26.004 --> 00:11:29.494\nbut in also in her throat,\narm, eye, brain.\n\n00:11:29.518 --> 00:11:31.864\nThat makes a difference in whose legs?\n\n00:11:32.272 --> 00:11:34.384\nIn the legs of the next runner.\n\n00:11:34.686 --> 00:11:37.520\nBut when the next runner runs super-fast,\n\n00:11:37.544 --> 00:11:39.672\nis it because she made a super effort,\n\n00:11:39.696 --> 00:11:42.933\nor because of the way\nthe third runner passed the baton?\n\n00:11:43.361 --> 00:11:47.216\nThere is no metric on earth\nthat will give us the answer.\n\n00:11:48.268 --> 00:11:52.779\nAnd if we reward people on the basis\nof their measurable performance,\n\n00:11:52.803 --> 00:11:55.857\nthey will put their energy,\ntheir attention, their blood\n\n00:11:55.881 --> 00:11:57.904\nin what can get measured -- in their legs.\n\n00:11:58.539 --> 00:12:00.785\nAnd the baton will fall and slow down.\n\n00:12:01.492 --> 00:12:04.064\nTo cooperate is not a super effort,\n\n00:12:04.088 --> 00:12:06.111\nit is how you allocate your effort.\n\n00:12:07.238 --> 00:12:09.078\nIt is to take a risk,\n\n00:12:09.102 --> 00:12:13.332\nbecause you sacrifice\nthe ultimate protection\n\n00:12:13.356 --> 00:12:18.783\ngranted by objectively measurable\nindividual performance.\n\n00:12:20.474 --> 00:12:24.351\nIt is to make a super difference\nin the performance of others,\n\n00:12:24.375 --> 00:12:26.065\nwith whom we are compared.\n\n00:12:26.715 --> 00:12:29.049\nIt takes being stupid to cooperate, then.\n\n00:12:29.509 --> 00:12:32.239\nAnd people are not stupid;\nthey don't cooperate.\n\n00:12:32.696 --> 00:12:37.836\nYou know, clarity, accountability,\nmeasurement were OK\n\n00:12:37.860 --> 00:12:40.276\nwhen the world was simpler.\n\n00:12:40.887 --> 00:12:43.911\nBut business has become much more complex.\n\n00:12:43.935 --> 00:12:45.966\nWith my teams, we have measured\n\n00:12:45.990 --> 00:12:49.014\nthe evolution of complexity in business.\n\n00:12:49.038 --> 00:12:54.641\nIt is much more demanding today\nto attract and retain customers,\n\n00:12:54.665 --> 00:12:57.976\nto build advantage on a global scale,\n\n00:12:58.000 --> 00:12:59.459\nto create value.\n\n00:13:00.649 --> 00:13:03.406\nAnd the more business gets complex,\n\n00:13:03.430 --> 00:13:08.731\nthe more, in the name of clarity,\naccountability, measurement\n\n00:13:08.755 --> 00:13:12.419\nwe multiply structures,\nprocesses, systems.\n\n00:13:13.041 --> 00:13:17.850\nYou know, this drive for clarity\nand accountability triggers\n\n00:13:17.874 --> 00:13:23.229\na counterproductive multiplication\nof interfaces, middle offices,\n\n00:13:23.253 --> 00:13:28.290\ncoordinators that do not only\nmobilize people and resources,\n\n00:13:28.314 --> 00:13:30.623\nbut that also add obstacles.\n\n00:13:31.234 --> 00:13:35.804\nAnd the more complicated the organization,\n\n00:13:35.828 --> 00:13:39.481\nthe more difficult it is to understand\nwhat is really happening.\n\n00:13:39.505 --> 00:13:44.925\nSo we need summaries, proxies, reports,\n\n00:13:44.949 --> 00:13:48.249\nkey performance indicators, metrics.\n\n00:13:48.273 --> 00:13:52.985\nSo people put their energy\nin what can get measured,\n\n00:13:53.009 --> 00:13:55.104\nat the expense of cooperation.\n\n00:13:55.128 --> 00:13:57.660\nAnd as performance deteriorates,\n\n00:13:57.684 --> 00:14:00.813\nwe add even more structure,\nprocess, systems.\n\n00:14:00.837 --> 00:14:03.669\nPeople spend their time in meetings,\n\n00:14:03.693 --> 00:14:07.819\nwriting reports they have\nto do, undo and redo.\n\n00:14:08.247 --> 00:14:11.669\nBased on our analysis,\nteams in these organizations\n\n00:14:11.693 --> 00:14:17.864\nspend between 40 and 80 percent\nof their time wasting their time,\n\n00:14:17.888 --> 00:14:21.881\nbut working harder and harder,\nlonger and longer,\n\n00:14:21.905 --> 00:14:24.848\non less and less value-adding activities.\n\n00:14:26.200 --> 00:14:28.510\nThis is what is killing productivity,\n\n00:14:28.534 --> 00:14:30.732\nwhat makes people suffer at work.\n\n00:14:31.184 --> 00:14:35.721\nOur organizations are wasting\nhuman intelligence.\n\n00:14:35.745 --> 00:14:39.393\nThey have turned against human efforts.\n\n00:14:40.631 --> 00:14:43.521\nWhen people don't cooperate,\n\n00:14:43.545 --> 00:14:47.940\ndon't blame their mindsets,\ntheir mentalities, their personality --\n\n00:14:47.964 --> 00:14:50.115\nlook at the work situations.\n\n00:14:51.083 --> 00:14:55.332\nIs it really in their personal interest\nto cooperate or not,\n\n00:14:55.356 --> 00:14:59.341\nif, when they cooperate,\nthey are individually worse off?\n\n00:14:59.872 --> 00:15:01.491\nWhy would they cooperate?\n\n00:15:01.880 --> 00:15:05.472\nWhen we blame personalities\n\n00:15:05.496 --> 00:15:11.654\ninstead of the clarity,\nthe accountability, the measurement,\n\n00:15:11.678 --> 00:15:15.336\nwe add injustice to ineffectiveness.\n\n00:15:17.612 --> 00:15:19.525\nWe need to create organizations\n\n00:15:19.549 --> 00:15:23.863\nin which it becomes individually useful\nfor

I was interested in science \u2014 fascinated by it, excited to learn about it. And I had a high school science teacher who would say to the class, \"The girls don't have to listen to this.\"Encouraging, yes.(Laughter)I chose not to listen \u2014 but to that statement alone.So let me take you to the Andes mountains in Chile, 500 kilometers, 300 miles northeast of Santiago. It's very remote, it's very dry and it's very beautiful. And there's not much there. There are condors, there are tarantulas, and at night, when the light dims, it reveals one of the darkest skies on Earth. It's kind of a magic place, the mountain. It's a wonderful combination of very remote mountaintop with exquisitely sophisticated technology.And our ancestors, for as long as there's been recorded history, have looked at the night sky and pondered the nature of our existence. And we're no exception, our generation. The only difficulty is that the night sky now is blocked by the glare of city lights. And so astronomers go to these very remote mountaintops to view and to study the cosmos. So telescopes are our window to the cosmos.It's no exaggeration to say that the Southern Hemisphere is going to be the future of astronomy for the 21st century. We have an array of existing telescopes already, in the Andes mountains in Chile, and that's soon to be joined by a really sensational array of new capability. There will be two international groups that are going to be building giant telescopes, sensitive to optical radiation, as our eyes are. There will be a survey telescope that will be scanning the sky every few nights. There will be radio telescopes, sensitive to long-wavelength radio radiation. And then there will be telescopes in space. There'll be a successor to the Hubble Space Telescope; it's called the James Webb Telescope, and it will be launched in 2018. There'll be a satellite called TESS that will discover planets outside of our solar system.For the last decade, I've been leading a group \u2014 a consortium \u2014 international group, to build what will be, when it's finished, the largest optical telescope in existence. It's called the Giant Magellan Telescope, or GMT. This telescope is going to have mirrors that are 8.4 meters in diameter \u2014 each of the mirrors. That's almost 27 feet. So it dwarfs this stage \u2014 maybe out to the fourth row in this audience. Each of the seven mirrors in this telescope will be almost 27 feet in diameter. Together, the seven mirrors in this telescope will comprise 80 feet in diameter. So, essentially the size of this entire auditorium. The whole telescope will stand about 43 meters high, and again, being in Rio, some of you have been to see the statue of the giant Christ. The scale is comparable in height; in fact, it's smaller than this telescope will be. It's comparable to the size of the Statue of Liberty. And it's going to be housed in an enclosure that's 22 stories \u2014 60 meters high. But it's an unusual building to protect this telescope. It will have open windows to the sky, be able to point and look at the sky, and it will actually rotate on a base \u2014 2,000 tons of rotating building.The Giant Magellan Telescope will have 10 times the resolution of the Hubble Space Telescope. It will be 20 million times more sensitive than the human eye. And it may, for the first time ever, be capable of finding life on planets outside of our solar system. It's going to allow us to look back at the first light in the universe \u2014 literally, the dawn of the cosmos. The cosmic dawn. It's a telescope that's going to allow us to peer back, witness galaxies as they were when they were actually assembling, the first black holes in the universe, the first galaxies.Now, for thousands of years, we have been studying the cosmos, we've been wondering about our place in the universe. The ancient Greeks told us that the Earth was the center of the universe. Five hundred years ago, Copernicus displaced the Earth, and put the Sun at the heart of the cosmos. And as we've learned over the centuries, since Galileo Galilei, the Italian scientist, first turned, in that time, a two-inch, very small telescope, to the sky, every time we have built larger telescopes, we have learned something about the universe; we've made discoveries, without exception. We've learned in the 20th century that the universe is expanding and that our own solar system is not at the center of that expansion. We know now that the universe is made of about 100 billion galaxies that are visible to us, and each one of those galaxies has 100 billion stars within it.So we're looking now at the deepest image of the cosmos that's ever been taken. It was taken using the Hubble Space Telescope, and by pointing the telescope at what was previously a blank region of sky, before the launch of Hubble. And if you can imagine this tiny area, it's only one-fiftieth of the size of the full moon. So, if you can imagine the full moon. And there are now 10,000 galaxies visible within that image. And the faintness of those images and the tiny size is only a result of the fact that those galaxies are so far away, the vast distances. And each of those galaxies may contain within it a few billion or even hundreds of billions of individual stars. Telescopes are like time machines. So the farther back we look in space, the further back we see in time. And they're like light buckets \u2014 literally, they collect light. So larger the bucket, the larger the mirror we have, the more light we can see, and the farther back we can view.So, we've learned in the last century that there are exotic objects in the universe \u2014 black holes. We've even learned that there's dark matter and dark energy that we can't see. So you're looking now at an actual image of dark matter.(Laughter)You got it. Not all audiences get that.(Laughter)So the way we infer the presence of dark matter \u2014 we can't see it \u2014 but there's an unmistakable tug, due to gravity. We now can look out, we see this sea of galaxies in a universe that's expanding.What I do myself is to measure the expansion of the universe, and one of the projects that I carried out in the 1990s used the Hubble Space Telescope to measure how fast the universe is expanding. We can now trace back to 14 billion years. We've learned over time that stars have individual histories; that is, they have birth, they have middle ages and some of them even have dramatic deaths. So the embers from those stars actually then form the new stars that we see, most of which turn out to have planets going around them.And one of the really surprising results in the last 20 years has been the discovery of other planets going around other stars. These are called exoplanets. And until 1995, we didn't even know the existence of any other planets, other than going around our own sun. But now, there are almost 2,000 other planets orbiting other stars that we can now detect, measure masses for. There are 500 of those that are multiple-planet systems. And there are 4,000 \u2014 and still counting \u2014 other candidates for planets orbiting other stars. They come in a bewildering variety of different kinds. There are Jupiter-like planets that are hot, there are other planets that are icy, there are water worlds and there are rocky planets like the Earth, so-called \"super-Earths,\" and there have even been planets that have been speculated diamond worlds.So we know there's at least one planet, our own Earth, in which there is life. We've even found planets that are orbiting two stars. That's no longer the province of science fiction. So around our own planet, we know there's life, we've developed a complex life, we now can question our own origins. And given all that we've discovered, the overwhelming numbers now suggest that there may be millions, perhaps \u2014 maybe even hundreds of millions \u2014 of other [planets] that are close enough \u2014 just the right distance from their stars that they're orbiting \u2014 to have the existence of liquid water and maybe could potentially support life. So we marvel now at those odds, the overwhelming odds, and the amazing thing is that within the next decade, the GMT may be able to take spectra of the atmospheres of those planets, and determine whether or not they have the potential for life.So, what is the GMT project? It's an international project. It includes Australia, South Korea, and I'm happy to say, being here in Rio, that the newest partner in our telescope is Brazil.(Applause)It also includes a number of institutions across the United States, including Harvard University, the Smithsonian and the Carnegie Institutions, and the Universities of Arizona, Chicago, Texas-Austin and Texas A&M University. It also involves Chile.So, the making of the mirrors in this telescope is also fascinating in its own right. Take chunks of glass, melt them in a furnace that is itself rotating. This happens underneath the football stadium at the University of Arizona. It's tucked away under 52,000 seats. Nobody know it's happening. And there's essentially a rotating cauldron. The mirrors are cast and they're cooled very slowly, and then they're polished to an exquisite precision. And so, if you think about the precision of these mirrors, the bumps on the mirror, over the entire 27 feet, amount to less than one-millionth of an inch. So, can you visualize that? Ow!(Laughter)That's one five-thousandths of the width of one of my hairs, over this entire 27 feet. It's a spectacular achievement. It's what allows us to have the precision that we will have.So, what does that precision buy us? So the GMT, if you can imagine \u2014 if I were to hold up a coin, which I just happen to have, and I look at the face of that coin, I can see from here the writing on the coin; I can see the face on that coin. My guess that even in the front row, you can't see that. But if we were to turn the Giant Magellan Telescope, all 80-feet diameter that we see in this auditorium, and point it 200 miles away, if I were standing in S\u00e3o Paulo, we could resolve the face of this coin. That's the extraordinary resolution and power of this telescope. And if we were \u2014(Applause)If an astronaut went up to the Moon, a quarter of a million miles away, and lit a candle \u2014 a single candle \u2014 then we would be able to detect it, using the GMT. Quite extraordinary.This is a simulated image of a cluster in a nearby galaxy. \"Nearby\" is astronomical, it's all relative. It's tens of millions of light-years away. This is what this cluster would look like. So look at those four bright objects, and now lets compare it with a camera on the Hubble Space Telescope. You can see faint detail that starts to come through. And now finally \u2014 and look how dramatic this is \u2014 this is what the GMT will see. So, keep your eyes on those bright images again. This is what we see on one of the most powerful existing telescopes on the Earth, and this, again, what the GMT will see. Extraordinary precision.So, where are we? We have now leveled the top of the mountaintop in Chile. We blasted that off. We've tested and polished the first mirror. We've cast the second and the third mirrors. And we're about to cast the fourth mirror. We had a series of reviews this year, international panels that came in and reviewed us, and said, \"You're ready to go to construction.\" And so we plan on building this telescope with the first four mirrors. We want to get on the air quickly, and be taking science data \u2014 what we astronomers call \"first light,\" in 2021. And the full telescope will be finished in the middle of the next decade, with all seven mirrors.So we're now poised to look back at the distant universe, the cosmic dawn. We'll be able to study other planets in exquisite detail.But for me, one of the most exciting things about building the GMT is the opportunity to actually discover something that we don't know about \u2014 that we can't even imagine at this point, something completely new. And my hope is that with the construction of this and other facilities, that many young women and men will be inspired to reach for the stars.Thank you very much. Obrigado.(Applause)Bruno Giussani: Thank you, Wendy. Stay with me, because I have a question for you. You mentioned different facilities. So the Magellan Telescope is going up, but also ALMA and others in Chile and elsewhere, including in Hawaii. Is it about cooperation and complementarity, or about competition? I know there's competition in terms of funding, but what about the science?Wendy Freedman: In terms of the science, they're very complementary. The telescopes that are in space, the telescopes on the ground, telescopes with different wavelength capability, telescopes even that are similar, but different instruments \u2014 they will all look at different parts of the questions that we're asking. So when we discover other planets, we'll be able to test those observations, we'll be able to measure the atmospheres, be able to look in space with very high resolution. So, they're very complementary. You're right about the funding, we compete; but scientifically, it's very complementary.BG: Wendy, thank you very much for coming to TEDGlobal.WF: Thank you.(Applause)", "id": 2320, "subtitle":

00:05:24.603\nWe've learned in the 20th century\nthat the universe is expanding\n\n00:05:24.627 --> 00:05:29.351\nand that our own solar system\nis not at the center of that expansion.\n\n00:05:29.715 --> 00:05:34.994\nWe know now that the universe\nis made of about 100 billion galaxies\n\n00:05:35.018 --> 00:05:36.668\nthat are visible to us,\n\n00:05:36.692 --> 00:05:42.103\nand each one of those galaxies\nhas 100 billion stars within it.\n\n00:05:43.192 --> 00:05:46.054\nSo we're looking now\nat the deepest image of the cosmos\n\n00:05:46.078 --> 00:05:47.577\nthat's ever been taken.\n\n00:05:47.973 --> 00:05:50.791\nIt was taken using\nthe Hubble Space Telescope,\n\n00:05:50.815 --> 00:05:55.705\nand by pointing the telescope at what\nwas previously a blank region of sky,\n\n00:05:55.729 --> 00:05:57.328\nbefore the launch of Hubble.\n\n00:05:57.352 --> 00:05:59.615\nAnd if you can imagine this tiny area,\n\n00:05:59.639 --> 00:06:02.969\nit's only one-fiftieth\nof the size of the full moon.\n\n00:06:02.993 --> 00:06:05.033\nSo, if you can imagine the full moon.\n\n00:06:05.057 --> 00:06:09.195\nAnd there are now 10,000 galaxies\nvisible within that image.\n\n00:06:09.740 --> 00:06:14.418\nAnd the faintness of those images\nand the tiny size is only a result\n\n00:06:14.442 --> 00:06:18.849\nof the fact that those galaxies\nare so far away, the vast distances.\n\n00:06:18.873 --> 00:06:21.806\nAnd each of those galaxies\nmay contain within it\n\n00:06:21.830 --> 00:06:26.839\na few billion or even hundreds\nof billions of individual stars.\n\n00:06:27.549 --> 00:06:29.568\nTelescopes are like time machines.\n\n00:06:29.592 --> 00:06:34.055\nSo the farther back we look in space,\nthe further back we see in time.\n\n00:06:34.428 --> 00:06:37.614\nAnd they're like light buckets --\nliterally, they collect light.\n\n00:06:37.638 --> 00:06:40.872\nSo larger the bucket,\nthe larger the mirror we have,\n\n00:06:40.896 --> 00:06:44.306\nthe more light we can see,\nand the farther back we can view.\n\n00:06:45.568 --> 00:06:47.839\nSo, we've learned in the last century\n\n00:06:47.863 --> 00:06:50.797\nthat there are exotic objects\nin the universe -- black holes.\n\n00:06:50.821 --> 00:06:53.598\nWe've even learned\nthat there's dark matter and dark energy\n\n00:06:53.622 --> 00:06:54.833\nthat we can't see.\n\n00:06:55.176 --> 00:06:58.734\nSo you're looking now\nat an actual image of dark matter.\n\n00:06:58.758 --> 00:06:59.908\n(Laughter)\n\n00:06:59.932 --> 00:07:02.575\nYou got it. Not all audiences get that.\n\n00:07:02.599 --> 00:07:04.364\n(Laughter)\n\n00:07:04.388 --> 00:07:07.112\nSo the way we infer\nthe presence of dark matter --\n\n00:07:07.136 --> 00:07:11.831\nwe can't see it -- but there's\nan unmistakable tug, due to gravity.\n\n00:07:13.260 --> 00:07:16.638\nWe now can look out,\nwe see this sea of galaxies\n\n00:07:16.662 --> 00:07:18.439\nin a universe that's expanding.\n\n00:07:18.820 --> 00:07:22.123\nWhat I do myself is to measure\nthe expansion of the universe,\n\n00:07:22.147 --> 00:07:25.288\nand one of the projects\nthat I carried out in the 1990s\n\n00:07:25.312 --> 00:07:30.428\nused the Hubble Space Telescope to measure\nhow fast the universe is expanding.\n\n00:07:31.314 --> 00:07:35.280\nWe can now trace back to 14 billion years.\n\n00:07:35.689 --> 00:07:40.025\nWe've learned over time\nthat stars have individual histories;\n\n00:07:40.049 --> 00:07:42.978\nthat is, they have birth,\nthey have middle ages\n\n00:07:43.002 --> 00:07:45.332\nand some of them\neven have dramatic deaths.\n\n00:07:45.787 --> 00:07:51.902\nSo the embers from those stars actually\nthen form the new stars that we see,\n\n00:07:51.926 --> 00:07:55.737\nmost of which turn out to have\nplanets going around them.\n\n00:07:56.230 --> 00:08:00.265\nAnd one of the really surprising results\nin the last 20 years\n\n00:08:00.289 --> 00:08:04.415\nhas been the discovery\nof other planets going around other stars.\n\n00:08:04.439 --> 00:08:06.345\nThese are called exoplanets.\n\n00:08:06.369 --> 00:08:11.365\nAnd until 1995, we didn't even know\nthe existence of any other planets,\n\n00:08:11.389 --> 00:08:13.723\nother than going around our own sun.\n\n00:08:14.318 --> 00:08:20.739\nBut now, there are almost 2,000\nother planets orbiting other stars\n\n00:08:20.763 --> 00:08:23.323\nthat we can now detect,\nmeasure masses for.\n\n00:08:23.347 --> 00:08:27.019\nThere are 500 of those\nthat are multiple-planet systems.\n\n00:08:27.043 --> 00:08:31.003\nAnd there are 4,000 --\nand still counting -- other candidates\n\n00:08:31.027 --> 00:08:33.241\nfor planets orbiting other stars.\n\n00:08:33.748 --> 00:08:36.721\nThey come in a bewildering variety\nof different kinds.\n\n00:08:37.092 --> 00:08:40.378\nThere are Jupiter-like\nplanets that are hot,\n\n00:08:40.402 --> 00:08:44.660\nthere are other planets that are icy,\nthere are water worlds\n\n00:08:44.684 --> 00:08:47.938\nand there are rocky planets\nlike the Earth, so-called \"super-Earths,\"\n\n00:08:47.962 --> 00:08:52.649\nand there have even been planets\nthat have been speculated diamond worlds.\n\n00:08:53.752 --> 00:08:58.707\nSo we know there's at least one planet,\nour own Earth, in which there is life.\n\n00:08:58.731 --> 00:09:02.891\nWe've even found planets\nthat are orbiting two stars.\n\n00:09:02.915 --> 00:09:06.096\nThat's no longer the province\nof science fiction.\n\n00:09:07.169 --> 00:09:09.383\nSo around our own planet,\nwe know there's life,\n\n00:09:09.407 --> 00:09:15.123\nwe've developed a complex life,\nwe now can question our own origins.\n\n00:09:15.686 --> 00:09:19.906\nAnd given all that we've discovered,\nthe overwhelming numbers now suggest\n\n00:09:19.930 --> 00:09:24.002\nthat there may be millions, perhaps --\nmaybe even hundreds of millions --\n\n00:09:24.026 --> 00:09:26.805\nof other [planets]\nthat are close enough --\n\n00:09:26.829 --> 00:09:30.119\njust the right distance from their stars\nthat they're orbiting --\n\n00:09:30.143 --> 00:09:35.679\nto have the existence of liquid water\nand maybe could potentially support life.\n\n00:09:36.079 --> 00:09:40.253\nSo we marvel now at those odds,\nthe overwhelming odds,\n\n00:09:40.277 --> 00:09:43.220\nand the amazing thing\nis that within the next decade,\n\n00:09:43.244 --> 00:09:48.474\nthe GMT may be able to take spectra\nof the atmospheres of those planets,\n\n00:09:48.498 --> 00:09:52.010\nand determine whether or not\nthey have the potential for life.\n\n00:09:53.660 --> 00:09:55.440\nSo, what is the GMT project?\n\n00:09:55.464 --> 00:09:57.338\nIt's an international project.\n\n00:09:57.362 --> 00:10:03.211\nIt includes Australia, South Korea,\nand I'm happy to say, being here in Rio,\n\n00:10:03.235 --> 00:10:06.270\nthat the newest partner\nin our telescope is Brazil.\n\n00:10:06.783 --> 00:10:11.242\n(Applause)\n\n00:10:11.266 --> 00:10:16.056\nIt also includes a number of institutions\nacross the United States,\n\n00:10:16.080 --> 00:10:19.176\nincluding Harvard University,\n\n00:10:19.200 --> 00:10:22.144\nthe Smithsonian\nand the Carnegie Institutions,\n\n00:10:22.168 --> 00:10:28.635\nand the Universities of Arizona, Chicago,\nTexas-Austin and Texas A&amp;M University.\n\n00:10:29.032 --> 00:10:30.919\nIt also involves Chile.\n\n00:10:32.681 --> 00:10:35.893\nSo, the making of the mirrors\nin this telescope is also fascinating\n\n00:10:35.917 --> 00:10:37.282\nin its own right.\n\n00:10:37.306 --> 00:10:41.941\nTake chunks of glass, melt them\nin a furnace that is itself rotating.\n\n00:10:42.709 --> 00:10:44.800\nThis happens underneath\nthe football stadium\n\n00:10:44.824 --> 00:10:46.866\nat the University of Arizona.\n\n00:10:46.890 --> 00:10:49.826\nIt's tucked away under 52,000 seats.\n\n00:10:49.850 --> 00:10:51.251\nNobody know it's happening.\n\n00:10:51.696 --> 00:10:55.020\nAnd there's essentially\na rotating cauldron.\n\n00:10:55.044 --> 00:10:58.079\nThe mirrors are cast\nand they're cooled very slowly,\n\n00:10:58.103 --> 00:11:01.016\nand then they're polished\nto an exquisite precision.\n\n00:11:01.595 --> 00:11:04.672\nAnd so, if you think\nabout the precision of these mirrors,\n\n00:11:04.696 --> 00:11:09.249\nthe bumps on the mirror,\nover the entire 27 feet,\n\n00:11:09.273 --> 00:11:12.952\namount to less\nthan one-millionth of an inch.\n\n00:11:12.976 --> 00:11:14.500\nSo, can you visualize that?\n\n00:11:15.047 --> 00:11:16.198\nOw!\n\n00:11:16.222 --> 00:11:17.546\n(Laughter)\n\n00:11:17.570 --> 00:11:23.841\nThat's one five-thousandths\nof the width of one of my hairs,\n\n00:11:23.865 --> 00:11:26.002\nover this entire 27 feet.\n\n00:11:26.026 --> 00:11:27.896\nIt's a spectacular achievement.\n\n00:11:27.920 --> 00:11:31.235\nIt's what allows us to have\nthe precision that we will have.\n\n00:11:32.834 --> 00:11:35.251\nSo, what does that precision buy us?\n\n00:11:35.801 --> 00:11:38.540\nSo the GMT, if you can imagine --\n\n00:11:38.564 --> 00:11:43.013\nif I were to hold up a coin,\nwhich I just happen to have,\n\n00:11:43.037 --> 00:11:48.028\nand I look at the face of that coin,\nI can see from here\n\n00:11:48.052 --> 00:11:52.037\nthe writing on the coin;\nI can see the face on that coin.\n\n00:11:52.061 --> 00:11:55.175\nMy guess that even in the front row,\nyou can't see that.\n\n00:11:55.603 --> 00:11:58.465\nBut if we were to turn\nthe Giant Magellan Telescope,\n\n00:11:58.489 --> 00:12:01.862\nall 80-feet diameter\nthat we see in this auditorium,\n\n00:12:01.886 --> 00:12:04.955\nand point it 200 miles away,\n\n00:12:04.979 --> 00:12:10.847\nif I were standing in S\u00e3o Paulo,\nwe could resolve the face of this coin.\n\n00:12:10.871 --> 00:12:14.478\nThat's the extraordinary resolution\nand power of this telescope.\n\n00:12:15.719 --> 00:12:18.417\nAnd if we were --\n\n00:12:18.441 --> 00:12:22.311\n(Applause)\n\n00:12:22.335 --> 00:12:26.936\nIf an astronaut went up to the Moon,\na quarter of a million miles away,\n\n00:12:26.960 --> 00:12:29.876\nand lit a candle -- a single candle --\n\n00:12:29.900 --> 00:12:32.710\nthen we would be able\nto detect it, using the GMT.\n\n00:12:33.305 --> 00:12:34.587\nQuite extraordinary.\n\n00:12:37.292 --> 00:12:42.973\nThis is a simulated image\nof a cluster in a nearby galaxy.\n\n00:12:42.997 --> 00:12:45.582\n\"Nearby\" is astronomical,\nit's all relative.\n\n00:12:45.606 --> 00:12:48.109\nIt's tens of millions of light-years away.\n\n00:12:48.133 --> 00:12:50.147\nThis is what this cluster would look like.\n\n00:12:50.171 --> 00:12:52.339\nSo look at those four bright objects,\n\n00:12:52.363 --> 00:12:56.370\nand now lets compare it with a camera\non the Hubble Space Telescope.\n\n00:12:56.394 --> 00:12:59.573\nYou can see faint detail\nthat starts to come through.\n\n00:12:59.597 --> 00:13:05.892\nAnd now finally -- and look how dramatic\nthis is -- this is what the GMT will see.\n\n00:13:05.916 --> 00:13:08.286\nSo, keep your eyes on those\nbright images again.\n\n00:13:08.310 --> 00:13:12.728\nThis is what we see on one of the most\npowerful existing telescopes on the Earth,\n\n00:13:12.752 --> 00:13:15.633\nand this, again, what the GMT will see.\n\n00:13:16.512 --> 00:13:18.370\nExtraordinary precision.\n\n00:13:18.933 --> 00:13:20.255\nSo, where are we?\n\n00:13:20.279 --> 00:13:23.461\nWe have now leveled the top\nof the mountaintop in Chile.\n\n00:13:23.485 --> 00:13:25.248\nWe blasted that off.\n\n00:13:25.272 --> 00:13:27.991\nWe've tested and polished\nthe first mirror.\n\n00:13:28.015 --> 00:13:30.604\nWe've cast the second\nand the third mirrors.\n\n00:13:30.628 --> 00:13:32.897\nAnd we're about to cast the fourth mirror.\n\n00:13:32.921 --> 00:13:34.808\nWe had a series of reviews this year,\n\n00:13:34.832 --> 00:13:37.374\ninternational panels\nthat came in and reviewed us,\n\n00:13:37.398 --> 00:13:39.929\nand said, \"You're ready\nto go to construction.\"\n\n00:13:39.953 --> 00:13:43.302\nAnd so we plan on building this telescope\nwith the first four mirrors.\n\n00:13:43.326 --> 00:13:47.455\nWe want to get on the air quickly,\nand be taking science data --\n\n00:13:47.479 --> 00:13:52.058\nwhat we astronomers call\n\"first light,\" in 2021.\n\n00:13:52.989 --> 00:13:56.435\nAnd the full telescope will be finished\nin the middle of the next decade,\n\n00:13:56.459 --> 00:13:57.855\nwith all seven mirrors.\n\n00:13:58.500 --> 00:14:02.058\nSo we're now poised to look back\nat the distant universe,\n\n00:14:02.082 --> 00:14:03.390\nthe cosmic dawn.\n\n00:14:03.762 --> 00:14:07.895\nWe'll be able to study other planets\nin exquisite detail.\n\n00:14:08.382 --> 00:14:12.119\nBut for me, one of the most\nexciting things about building the GMT\n\n00:14:12.143 --> 00:14:14.973\nis the opportunity\nto actually discover something\n\n00:14:14.997 --> 00:14:18.267\nthat we don't know about --\nthat we can't even imagine at this point,\n\n00:14:18.291 --> 00:14:19.933\nsomething completely new.\n\n00:14:20.671 --> 00:14:24.301\nAnd my hope is that with the construction\nof this and other facilities,\n\n00:14:24.325 --> 00:14:29.535\nthat many young women and men\nwill be inspired to reach for the stars.\n\n00:14:29.994 --> 00:14:31.266\nThank you very much.\n\n00:14:31.290 --> 00:14:32.765\nObrigado.\n\n00:14:32.789 --> 00:14:38.682\n(Applause)\n\n00:14:38.706 --> 00:14:40.308\nBruno Giussani: Thank you, Wendy.\n\n00:14:40.332 --> 00:14:42.599\nStay with me, because\nI have a question for you.\n\n00:14:42.623 --> 00:14:45.020\nYou mentioned different facilities.\n\n00:14:45.044 --> 00:14:49.897\nSo the Magellan Telescope is going up,\nbut also ALMA and others in Chile\n\n00:14:49.921 --> 00:14:52.057\nand elsewhere, including in Hawaii.\n\n00:14:52.730 --> 00:14:56.806\nIs it about cooperation\nand complementarity, or about competition?\n\n00:14:56.830 --> 00:15:00.552\nI know there's competition in terms\nof funding, but what about the science?\n\n00:15:00.576 --> 00:15:03.793\nWendy Freedman: In terms of the science,\nthey're very complementary.\n\n00:15:03.817 --> 00:15:06.844\nThe telescopes that are in space,\nthe telescopes on the ground,\n\n00:15:06.868 --> 00:15:09.298\ntelescopes with different\nwavelength capability,\n\n00:15:09.322 --> 00:15:12.265\ntelescopes even that are similar,\nbut different instruments --\n\n00:15:12.289 --> 00:15:16.035\nthey will all look at different parts\nof the questions that we're asking.\n\n00:15:16.059 --> 00:15:19.686\nSo when we discover other planets,\nwe'll be able to test those observations,\n\n00:15:19.710 --> 00:15:21.798\nwe'll be able to measure the atmospheres,\n\n00:15:21.822 --> 00:15:24.697\nbe able to look in space\nwith very high resolution.\n\n00:15:24.721 --> 00:15:26.198\nSo, they're very complementary.\n\n00:15:26.222 --> 00:15:28.459\nYou're right about\nthe funding, we compete;\n\n00:15:28.483 --> 00:15:31.148\nbut scientifically,\nit's very complementary.\n\n00:15:31.172 --> 00:15:33.825\nBG: Wendy, thank you very much\nfor coming to TEDGlobal.\n\n00:15:33.849 --> 00:15:35.000\nWF: Thank you.\n\n00:15:35.024

I was eight at the time, living in the village with my grandmother, who was raising me and other children. Famine had hit my country of Zimbabwe, and we just didn't have enough to eat. We were hungry. And that's when the girl in the blue uniform came to my village with the United Nations to feed the children.As she handed me my porridge, I asked her why she was there, and without hesitation, she said, \"As Africans, we must uplift all the people of Africa.\" I had absolutely no idea what she meant.(Laughter)But her words stuck with me.Two years later, famine hit my country for the second time. My grandmother had no choice but to send me to the city to live with an aunt I had never met before. So at the age of 10, I found myself in school for the very first time. And there, at the city school, I would experience what it was to be unequal. You see, in the village, we were all equal. But in the eyes and the minds of the other kids, I was not their equal. I couldn't speak English, and I was way behind in terms of reading and writing. But this feeling of inequality would get even more complex. Every school holiday spent back in the village with my grandmother made me consciously aware of the inequalities this incredible opportunity had created within my own family. Suddenly, I had much more than the rest of my village. And in their eyes, I was no longer their equal.I felt guilty. But I thought about the girl in the blue uniform, and I remember thinking, \"That's who I want to be \u2014 someone like her, someone who uplifts other people.\" This childhood experience led me to the United Nations, and to my current role with UN Women, where we are addressing one of the greatest inequalities that affects more than half of the world's population \u2014 women and girls.Today, I want to share with you a simple idea that seeks to uplift all of us together. Eight months ago, under the visionary leadership of Phumzile Mlambo-Ngcuka, head of UN Women, we launched a groundbreaking initiative called HeForShe, inviting men and boys from around the world to stand in solidarity with each other and with women, to create a shared vision for gender equality. This is an invitation for those who believe in equality for women and men, and those who don't yet know that they believe.The initiative is based on a simple idea: that what we share is much more powerful than what divides us. We all feel the same things. We all want the same things, even when those things sometimes remain unspoken. HeForShe is about uplifting all of us, women and men together. It's moving us towards an inflection point for gender equality.Imagine a blank page with one horizontal line splitting it in half. Now imagine that women are represented here, and men are represented here. In our current population, HeForShe is about moving the 3.2 billion men, one man at a time, across that line, so that ultimately, men can stand alongside women and be on the right side of history, making gender equality a reality in the 21st century.However, engaging men in the movement would prove quite controversial. Why invite men? They are the problem.(Laughter)In fact, men don't care, we were told.But something incredible happened when we launched HeForShe. In just three days, more than 100,000 men had signed up and committed to be agents of change for equality. Within that first week, at least one man in every single country in the world stood up to be counted, and within that same week, HeForShe created more than 1.2 billion conversations on social media. And that's when the emails started pouring in, sometimes as many as a thousand a day. We heard from a man out of Zimbabwe, who, after hearing about HeForShe, created a \"husband school.\"(Laughter)He literally went around his village, hand-picking all of the men that were abusive to their partners, and committed to turn them into better husbands and fathers. In Pune, India, a youth advocate organized an innovative bicycle rally, mobilizing 700 cyclists to share the HeForShe messages within their own community.In another impact story, a man sent a very personal note of something that had happened in his own community. He wrote, \"Dear Madam, I have lived all of my life next door to a man who continuously beats up his wife. Two weeks ago, I was listening to my radio, and your voice came on, and you spoke about something called the HeForShe, and the need for men to play their role. Within a few hours, I heard the woman cry again next door, but for the first time, I didn't just sit there. I felt compelled to do something, so I went over and I confronted the husband. Madam, it has been two weeks, and the woman has not cried since. Thank you for giving me a voice.\"(Applause)Personal impact stories such as these show that we are tapping into something within men, but getting to a world where women and men are equal is not just a matter of bringing men to the cause. We want concrete, systematic, structural change that can equalize the political, economic and social realities for women and men. We are asking men to make concrete actions, calling them to intervene at a personal level, to change their behavior. We are calling upon governments, businesses, universities, to change their policies. We want male leaders to become role models and change agents within their own institutions.Already, a number of prominent men and leaders have stepped up and made some concrete HeForShe commitments. In a few early success stories, a leading French hospitality company, Accor, has committed to eliminate the pay gap for all of its 180,000 employees by 2020.(Applause)The government of Sweden, under its current feminist government, has committed to close both the employment and the pay gap for all of its citizens within the current electoral term. In Japan, the University of Nagoya is building, as part of their HeForShe commitments, what will become one of Japan's leading gender-research centers.Now, eight months later, a movement is building. We are seeing men sign up from every single walk of life, and from every single corner in the world, from the United Nations' own Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon to the Secretary-Generals of NATO and the EU Council, from the prime minister of Bhutan to the president of Sierra Leone.In Europe alone, all the male EU Commissioners and the members of Parliament of the Swedish and Iceland governments have signed up to be HeForShe. In fact, one in 20 men in Iceland has joined the movement. The rallying call of our passionate goodwill ambassador, Emma Watson, has garnered more than five billion media impressions, mobilizing hundreds and thousands of students around the world to create more than a hundred HeForShe student associations.Now this is the beginning of the vision that HeForShe has for the world that we want to see. Einstein once said, \"A human being is part of the whole ... but he experiences himself, his thoughts and feelings, as something separate from the rest ... This delusion is a kind of prison for us ... Our task must be to free ourselves from this prison by widening our circle of compassion.\"If women and men are part of a greater whole, as Einstein suggests, it is my hope that HeForShe can help free us to realize that it is not our gender that defines us, but ultimately, our shared humanity. HeForShe is tapping into women's and men's dreams, the dreams that we have for ourselves, and the dreams that we have for our families, our children, friends, communities.So that's what it is about. HeForShe is about uplifting all of us together.Thank you.(Applause)", "id": 2311, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:13.489 --> 00:00:15.710\nI will always

"https://www.ted.com/talks/jamie_bartlett_how_the_mysterious_dark_net_is_going_mainstream", "transcript": "If you want to buy high-quality, low-price cocaine, there really is only one place to go, and that is the dark net anonymous markets.Now, you can't get to these sites with a normal browser \u2014 Chrome or Firefox \u2014 because they're on this hidden part of the Internet, known as Tor hidden services, where URLs are a string of meaningless numbers and letters that end in .onion, and which you access with a special browser called the Tor browser.Now, the Tor browser was originally a U.S. Naval intelligence project. It then became open source, and it allows anybody to browse the net without giving away their location. And it does this by encrypting your IP address and then routing it via several other computers around the world that use the same software. You can use it on the normal Internet, but it's also your key to the dark net. And because of this fiendishly clever encryption system, the 20 or 30 \u2014 we don't know exactly \u2014 thousand sites that operate there are incredibly difficult to shut down. It is a censorship-free world visited by anonymous users.Little wonder, then, that it's a natural place to go for anybody with something to hide, and that something, of course, need not be illegal. On the dark net, you will find whistle-blower sites, The New Yorker. You will find political activism blogs. You will find libraries of pirated books. But you'll also find the drugs markets, illegal pornography, commercial hacking services, and much more besides. Now, the dark net is one of the most interesting, exciting places anywhere on the net. And the reason is, because although innovation, of course, takes place in big businesses, takes place in world-class universities, it also takes place in the fringes, because those on the fringes \u2014 the pariahs, the outcasts \u2014 they're often the most creative, because they have to be. In this part of the Internet, you will not find a single lolcat, a single pop-up advert anywhere. And that's one of the reasons why I think many of you here will be on the dark net fairly soon.(Laughter)Not that I'm suggesting anyone in this audience would use it to go and procure high-quality narcotics. But let's say for a moment that you were.(Laughter)Bear with me. The first thing you will notice on signing up to one of these sites is how familiar it looks. Every single product \u2014 thousands of products \u2014 has a glossy, high-res image, a detailed product description, a price. There's a \"Proceed to checkout\" icon. There is even, most beautifully of all, a \"Report this item\" button.(Laughter)Incredible.You browse through the site, you make your choice, you pay with the crypto-currency bitcoin, you enter an address \u2014  preferably not your home address \u2014 and you wait for your product to arrive in the post, which it nearly always does. And the reason it does is not because of the clever encryption. That's important. Something far simpler than that. It's the user reviews.(Laughter)You see, every single vendor on these sites uses a pseudonym, naturally enough, but they keep the same pseudonym to build up a reputation. And because it's easy for the buyer to change allegiance whenever they want, the only way of trusting a vendor is if they have a good history of positive feedback from other users of the site.And this introduction of competition and choice does exactly what the economists would predict. Prices tend to go down, product quality tends to go up, and the vendors are attentive, they're polite, they're consumer-centric, offering you all manner of special deals, one-offs, buy-one-get-one-frees, free delivery, to keep you happy.I spoke to Drugsheaven. Drugsheaven was offering excellent and consistent marijuana at a reasonable price. He had a very generous refund policy, detailed T's and C's, and good shipping times.\"Dear Drugsheaven,\" I wrote, via the internal emailing system that's also encrypted, of course. \"I'm new here. Do you mind if I buy just one gram of marijuana?\"A couple of hours later, I get a reply. They always reply.\"Hi there, thanks for your email. Starting small is a wise thing to do. I would, too, if I were you.\"(Laughter)\"So no problem if you'd like to start with just one gram. I do hope we can do business together. Best wishes, Drugsheaven.\"(Laughter)I don't know why he had a posh English accent, but I assume he did.Now, this kind of consumer-centric attitude is the reason why, when I reviewed 120,000 pieces of feedback that had been left on one of these sites over a three-month period, 95 percent of them were five out of five. The customer, you see, is king. But what does that mean? Well, on the one hand, that means there are more drugs, more available, more easily, to more people. And by my reckoning, that is not a good thing. But, on the other hand, if you are going to take drugs, you have a reasonably good way of guaranteeing a certain level of purity and quality, which is incredibly important if you're taking drugs. And you can do so from the comfort of your own home, without the risks associated with buying on the streets.Now, as I said, you've got to be creative and innovative to survive in this marketplace. And the 20 or so sites that are currently in operation \u2014 by the way, they don't always work, they're not always perfect; the site that I showed you was shut down 18 months ago, but not before it had turned over a billion dollars' worth of trade. But these markets, because of the difficult conditions in which they are operating, the inhospitable conditions, are always innovating, always thinking of ways of getting smarter, more decentralized, harder to censor, and more customer-friendly.Let's take the payment system. You don't pay with your credit card, of course \u2014 that would lead directly back to you. So you use the crypto-currency bitcoin, which is easily exchanged for real-world currencies and gives quite a high degree of anonymity to its users.But at the beginning of these sites, people noticed a flaw. Some of the unscrupulous dealers were running away with peoples' bitcoin before they'd mailed the drugs out. The community came up with a solution, called multi-signature escrow payments. So on purchasing my item, I would send my bitcoin to a neutral, secure third digital wallet. The vendor, who would see that I'd sent it, would be confident that they could then send the product to me, and then when I received it, at least two of the three people engaged in the transaction \u2014 vendor, buyer, site administrator \u2014 would have to sign the transaction off with a unique digital signature, and then the money would be transferred.Brilliant! Elegant. It works.But then they realized there was a problem with bitcoin, because every bitcoin transaction is actually recorded publicly in a public ledger. So if you're clever, you can try and work out who's behind them. So they came up with a tumbling service. Hundreds of people send their bitcoin into one address, they're tumbled and jumbled up, and then the right amount is sent on to the right recipients, but they're different bitcoins: micro-laundering systems.(Laughter)It's incredible.Interested in what drugs are trending right now on the dark net markets? Check Grams, the search engine. You can even buy some advertising space.(Laughter)Are you an ethical consumer worried about what the drugs industry is doing? Yeah. One vendor will offer you fair trade organic cocaine.(Laughter)That's not being sourced from Colombian druglords, but Guatemalan farmers. They even promised to reinvest 20 percent of any profits into local education programs.(Laughter)There's even a mystery shopper.Now, whatever you think about the morality of these sites \u2014 and I submit that it's not actually an easy question \u2014 the creation of functioning, competitive, anonymous markets, where nobody knows who anybody else is, constantly at risk of being shut down by the authorities, is a staggering achievement, a phenomenal achievement. And it's that kind of innovation that's why those on the fringes are often the harbingers of what is to come.It's easy to forget that because of its short life, the Internet has actually changed many times over the last 30 years or so. It started in the '70s as a military project, morphed in the 1980s to an academic network, co-opted by commercial companies in the '90s, and then invaded by all of us via social media in the noughties, but I think it's going to change again. And I think things like the dark net markets \u2014 creative, secure, difficult to censor \u2014 I think that's the future.And the reason it's the future is because we're all worried about our privacy. Surveys consistently show concerns about privacy. The more time we spend online, the more we worry about them, and those surveys show our worries are growing. We're worried about what happens to our data. We're worried about who might be watching us.Since the revelations from Edward Snowden, there's been a huge increase in the number of people using various privacy-enhancing tools. There are now between two and three million daily users of the Tor browser, the majority of which use is perfectly legitimate, sometimes even mundane. And there are hundreds of activists around the world working on techniques and tools to keep you private online \u2014 default encrypted messaging services. Ethereum, which is a project which tries to link up the connected but unused hard drives of millions of computers around the world, to create a sort of distributed Internet that no one really controls. Now, we've had distributed computing before, of course. We use it for everything from Skype to the search for extraterrestrial life. But you add distributed computing and powerful encryption \u2014 that's very, very hard to censor and control. Another called MaidSafe works on similar principles. Another called Twister, and so on and so on.And here's the thing \u2014 the more of us join, the more interesting those sites become, and then the more of us join, and so on. And I think that's what's going to happen.In fact, it's already happening. The dark net is no longer a den for dealers and a hideout for whistle-blowers. It's already going mainstream. Just recently, the musician Aphex Twin released his album as a dark net site. Facebook has started a dark net site. A group of London architects have opened a dark net site for people worried about regeneration projects. Yes, the dark net is going mainstream, and I predict that fairly soon, every social media company, every major news outlet, and therefore most of you in this audience, will be using the dark net, too.So the Internet is about to get more interesting, more exciting, more innovative, more terrible, more destructive. That's good news if you care about liberty. It's good news if you care about freedom. It's good news if you care about democracy. It's also good news if you want to browse for illegal pornography and if you want to buy and sell drugs with impunity. Neither entirely dark, nor entirely light. It's not one side or the other that's going to win out, but both.Thank you very much, indeed.(Applause)", "id": 2322, "subtitle":

predict.\n\n00:04:37.304 --> 00:04:41.990\nPrices tend to go down,\nproduct quality tends to go up,\n\n00:04:42.014 --> 00:04:44.387\nand the vendors are attentive,\n\n00:04:44.411 --> 00:04:46.842\nthey're polite, they're consumer-centric,\n\n00:04:46.866 --> 00:04:51.178\noffering you all manner\nof special deals, one-offs,\n\n00:04:51.202 --> 00:04:54.373\nbuy-one-get-one-frees, free delivery,\n\n00:04:54.397 --> 00:04:55.581\nto keep you happy.\n\n00:04:56.911 --> 00:04:59.829\nI spoke to Drugsheaven.\n\n00:04:59.853 --> 00:05:05.743\nDrugsheaven was offering\nexcellent and consistent marijuana\n\n00:05:05.767 --> 00:05:07.309\nat a reasonable price.\n\n00:05:08.112 --> 00:05:11.921\nHe had a very generous refund policy,\n\n00:05:11.945 --> 00:05:13.733\ndetailed T's and C's,\n\n00:05:13.757 --> 00:05:15.169\nand good shipping times.\n\n00:05:15.566 --> 00:05:17.827\n\"Dear Drugsheaven,\" I wrote,\n\n00:05:17.851 --> 00:05:21.665\nvia the internal emailing system\nthat's also encrypted, of course.\n\n00:05:22.355 --> 00:05:26.496\n\"I'm new here. Do you mind\nif I buy just one gram of marijuana?\"\n\n00:05:27.408 --> 00:05:29.532\nA couple of hours later, I get a reply.\n\n00:05:29.556 --> 00:05:30.742\nThey always reply.\n\n00:05:31.188 --> 00:05:32.984\n\"Hi there, thanks for your email.\n\n00:05:34.112 --> 00:05:39.380\nStarting small is a wise thing to do.\nI would, too, if I were you.\"\n\n00:05:39.404 --> 00:05:41.166\n(Laughter)\n\n00:05:41.190 --> 00:05:44.311\n\"So no problem if you'd like to start\nwith just one gram.\n\n00:05:44.335 --> 00:05:46.846\nI do hope we can do business together.\n\n00:05:46.870 --> 00:05:48.733\nBest wishes, Drugsheaven.\"\n\n00:05:48.757 --> 00:05:50.733\n(Laughter)\n\n00:05:50.757 --> 00:05:54.021\nI don't know why he had a posh\nEnglish accent, but I assume he did.\n\n00:05:56.237 --> 00:06:00.733\nNow, this kind\nof consumer-centric attitude\n\n00:06:00.757 --> 00:06:06.193\nis the reason why, when I reviewed\n120,000 pieces of feedback\n\n00:06:06.217 --> 00:06:10.197\nthat had been left on one of these sites\nover a three-month period,\n\n00:06:10.221 --> 00:06:13.350\n95 percent of them were five out of five.\n\n00:06:14.521 --> 00:06:17.062\nThe customer, you see, is king.\n\n00:06:17.757 --> 00:06:18.967\nBut what does that mean?\n\n00:06:18.991 --> 00:06:20.932\nWell, on the one hand,\n\n00:06:20.956 --> 00:06:24.990\nthat means there are more drugs,\nmore available, more easily,\n\n00:06:25.014 --> 00:06:26.165\nto more people.\n\n00:06:26.757 --> 00:06:29.687\nAnd by my reckoning,\nthat is not a good thing.\n\n00:06:30.757 --> 00:06:34.470\nBut, on the other hand,\nif you are going to take drugs,\n\n00:06:34.494 --> 00:06:37.555\nyou have a reasonably good way\n\n00:06:37.579 --> 00:06:41.993\nof guaranteeing a certain level\nof purity and quality,\n\n00:06:42.017 --> 00:06:45.733\nwhich is incredibly important\nif you're taking drugs.\n\n00:06:45.757 --> 00:06:48.875\nAnd you can do so\nfrom the comfort of your own home,\n\n00:06:48.899 --> 00:06:53.086\nwithout the risks associated\nwith buying on the streets.\n\n00:06:53.919 --> 00:06:55.395\nNow, as I said,\n\n00:06:55.419 --> 00:06:59.521\nyou've got to be creative and innovative\nto survive in this marketplace.\n\n00:07:00.235 --> 00:07:03.329\nAnd the 20 or so sites\nthat are currently in operation --\n\n00:07:03.353 --> 00:07:07.058\nby the way, they don't always work,\nthey're not always perfect;\n\n00:07:07.082 --> 00:07:09.684\nthe site that I showed you\nwas shut down 18 months ago,\n\n00:07:09.708 --> 00:07:14.859\nbut not before it had turned\nover a billion dollars' worth of trade.\n\n00:07:17.428 --> 00:07:18.581\nBut these markets,\n\n00:07:18.605 --> 00:07:21.667\nbecause of the difficult conditions\nin which they are operating,\n\n00:07:21.691 --> 00:07:23.179\nthe inhospitable conditions,\n\n00:07:23.203 --> 00:07:26.551\nare always innovating, always\nthinking of ways of getting smarter,\n\n00:07:26.575 --> 00:07:28.813\nmore decentralized, harder to censor,\n\n00:07:28.837 --> 00:07:31.193\nand more customer-friendly.\n\n00:07:32.304 --> 00:07:33.733\nLet's take the payment system.\n\n00:07:34.341 --> 00:07:36.139\nYou don't pay with your credit card,\n\n00:07:36.163 --> 00:07:38.508\nof course -- that would lead\ndirectly back to you.\n\n00:07:38.532 --> 00:07:40.509\nSo you use the crypto-currency bitcoin,\n\n00:07:40.533 --> 00:07:44.988\nwhich is easily exchanged\nfor real-world currencies\n\n00:07:45.012 --> 00:07:48.757\nand gives quite a high degree\nof anonymity to its users.\n\n00:07:49.325 --> 00:07:52.252\nBut at the beginning of these sites,\npeople noticed a flaw.\n\n00:07:52.276 --> 00:07:56.341\nSome of the unscrupulous dealers\nwere running away with peoples' bitcoin\n\n00:07:56.365 --> 00:07:58.170\nbefore they'd mailed the drugs out.\n\n00:07:59.113 --> 00:08:05.008\nThe community came up with a solution,\ncalled multi-signature escrow payments.\n\n00:08:07.093 --> 00:08:10.586\nSo on purchasing my item,\n\n00:08:10.610 --> 00:08:13.636\nI would send my bitcoin\n\n00:08:13.660 --> 00:08:17.952\nto a neutral, secure third digital wallet.\n\n00:08:18.757 --> 00:08:21.346\nThe vendor, who would see\nthat I'd sent it,\n\n00:08:21.370 --> 00:08:24.326\nwould be confident that they\ncould then send the product to me,\n\n00:08:24.350 --> 00:08:25.733\nand then when I received it,\n\n00:08:25.757 --> 00:08:28.733\nat least two of the three people\nengaged in the transaction --\n\n00:08:28.757 --> 00:08:31.297\nvendor, buyer, site administrator --\n\n00:08:31.321 --> 00:08:33.733\nwould have to sign the transaction off\n\n00:08:33.757 --> 00:08:35.835\nwith a unique digital signature,\n\n00:08:35.859 --> 00:08:37.834\nand then the money would be transferred.\n\n00:08:38.221 --> 00:08:39.521\nBrilliant!\n\n00:08:39.545 --> 00:08:40.696\nElegant.\n\n00:08:40.720 --> 00:08:41.871\nIt works.\n\n00:08:42.835 --> 00:08:45.486\nBut then they realized there was\na problem with bitcoin,\n\n00:08:45.510 --> 00:08:47.211\nbecause every bitcoin transaction\n\n00:08:47.235 --> 00:08:49.733\nis actually recorded publicly\nin a public ledger.\n\n00:08:49.757 --> 00:08:53.034\nSo if you're clever, you can try\nand work out who's behind them.\n\n00:08:53.058 --> 00:08:56.343\nSo they came up with a tumbling service.\n\n00:08:56.367 --> 00:08:59.758\nHundreds of people send\ntheir bitcoin into one address,\n\n00:08:59.782 --> 00:09:01.757\nthey're tumbled and jumbled up,\n\n00:09:01.781 --> 00:09:05.571\nand then the right amount\nis sent on to the right recipients,\n\n00:09:05.595 --> 00:09:07.417\nbut they're different bitcoins:\n\n00:09:07.441 --> 00:09:09.131\nmicro-laundering systems.\n\n00:09:09.155 --> 00:09:10.689\n(Laughter)\n\n00:09:10.713 --> 00:09:11.869\nIt's incredible.\n\n00:09:11.893 --> 00:09:17.086\nInterested in what drugs are trending\nright now on the dark net markets?\n\n00:09:17.110 --> 00:09:19.187\nCheck Grams, the search engine.\n\n00:09:19.211 --> 00:09:21.376\nYou can even buy some advertising space.\n\n00:09:21.400 --> 00:09:23.465\n(Laughter)\n\n00:09:23.489 --> 00:09:28.427\nAre you an ethical consumer worried\nabout what the drugs industry is doing?\n\n00:09:29.022 --> 00:09:30.173\nYeah.\n\n00:09:30.550 --> 00:09:33.944\nOne vendor will offer you\nfair trade organic cocaine.\n\n00:09:33.968 --> 00:09:35.110\n(Laughter)\n\n00:09:35.134 --> 00:09:38.429\nThat's not being sourced\nfrom Colombian druglords,\n\n00:09:38.453 --> 00:09:39.882\nbut Guatemalan farmers.\n\n00:09:39.906 --> 00:09:43.218\nThey even promised to reinvest\n20 percent of any profits\n\n00:09:43.242 --> 00:09:45.032\ninto local education programs.\n\n00:09:45.056 --> 00:09:46.078\n(Laughter)\n\n00:09:46.102 --> 00:09:48.081\nThere's even a mystery shopper.\n\n00:09:48.894 --> 00:09:52.278\nNow, whatever you think\nabout the morality of these sites --\n\n00:09:52.302 --> 00:09:55.617\nand I submit that it's not\nactually an easy question --\n\n00:09:55.641 --> 00:10:01.143\nthe creation of functioning,\ncompetitive, anonymous markets,\n\n00:10:01.167 --> 00:10:03.733\nwhere nobody knows who anybody else is,\n\n00:10:03.757 --> 00:10:06.856\nconstantly at risk of being shut down\nby the authorities,\n\n00:10:06.880 --> 00:10:09.414\nis a staggering achievement,\n\n00:10:09.438 --> 00:10:11.476\na phenomenal achievement.\n\n00:10:12.537 --> 00:10:15.951\nAnd it's that kind of innovation\n\n00:10:15.975 --> 00:10:18.733\nthat's why those on the fringes\n\n00:10:18.757 --> 00:10:21.604\nare often the harbingers\nof what is to come.\n\n00:10:22.318 --> 00:10:24.422\nIt's easy to forget\n\n00:10:24.446 --> 00:10:26.508\nthat because of its short life,\n\n00:10:26.532 --> 00:10:30.179\nthe Internet has actually\nchanged many times\n\n00:10:30.203 --> 00:10:31.733\nover the last 30 years or so.\n\n00:10:31.757 --> 00:10:34.733\nIt started in the '70s\nas a military project,\n\n00:10:34.757 --> 00:10:38.733\nmorphed in the 1980s\nto an academic network,\n\n00:10:38.757 --> 00:10:41.219\nco-opted by commercial\ncompanies in the '90s,\n\n00:10:41.243 --> 00:10:44.698\nand then invaded by all of us\nvia social media in the noughties,\n\n00:10:44.722 --> 00:10:46.651\nbut I think it's going to change again.\n\n00:10:47.137 --> 00:10:49.733\nAnd I think things\nlike the dark net markets --\n\n00:10:49.757 --> 00:10:53.733\ncreative, secure, difficult to censor --\n\n00:10:53.757 --> 00:10:55.359\nI think that's the future.\n\n00:10:56.887 --> 00:10:58.515\nAnd the reason it's the future\n\n00:10:58.539 --> 00:11:01.207\nis because we're all worried\nabout our privacy.\n\n00:11:01.231 --> 00:11:04.456\nSurveys consistently show\nconcerns about privacy.\n\n00:11:04.480 --> 00:11:08.439\nThe more time we spend online,\nthe more we worry about them,\n\n00:11:08.463 --> 00:11:10.733\nand those surveys show\nour worries are growing.\n\n00:11:10.757 --> 00:11:12.873\nWe're worried about\nwhat happens to our data.\n\n00:11:12.897 --> 00:11:15.006\nWe're worried about\nwho might be watching us.\n\n00:11:15.030 --> 00:11:17.598\nSince the revelations from Edward Snowden,\n\n00:11:17.622 --> 00:11:20.068\nthere's been a huge increase\nin the number of people\n\n00:11:20.092 --> 00:11:23.184\nusing various privacy-enhancing tools.\n\n00:11:23.208 --> 00:11:26.445\nThere are now between two\nand three million daily users\n\n00:11:26.469 --> 00:11:27.744\nof the Tor browser,\n\n00:11:27.768 --> 00:11:32.935\nthe majority of which use\nis perfectly legitimate,\n\n00:11:32.959 --> 00:11:34.718\nsometimes even mundane.\n\n00:11:35.616 --> 00:11:38.767\nAnd there are hundreds of activists\naround the world\n\n00:11:38.791 --> 00:11:44.057\nworking on techniques and tools\nto keep you private online --\n\n00:11:45.069 --> 00:11:47.550\ndefault encrypted messaging services.\n\n00:11:47.574 --> 00:11:51.597\nEthereum, which is a project\nwhich tries to link up\n\n00:11:51.621 --> 00:11:56.699\nthe connected but unused hard drives\nof millions of computers around the world,\n\n00:11:56.723 --> 00:12:00.594\nto create a sort of distributed Internet\nthat no one really controls.\n\n00:12:00.618 --> 00:12:03.511\nNow, we've had distributed\ncomputing before, of course.\n\n00:12:03.535 --> 00:12:07.733\nWe use it for everything from Skype\nto the search for extraterrestrial life.\n\n00:12:07.757 --> 00:12:12.246\nBut you add distributed computing\nand powerful encryption --\n\n00:12:12.270 --> 00:12:16.157\nthat's very, very hard\nto censor and control.\n\n00:12:16.583 --> 00:12:19.396\nAnother called MaidSafe\nworks on similar principles.\n\n00:12:19.420 --> 00:12:22.868\nAnother called Twister,\nand so on and so on.\n\n00:12:23.354 --> 00:12:25.344\nAnd here's the thing --\n\n00:12:25.368 --> 00:12:26.832\nthe more of us join,\n\n00:12:26.856 --> 00:12:29.307\nthe more interesting those sites become,\n\n00:12:29.331 --> 00:12:31.819\nand then the more of us join, and so on.\n\n00:12:32.226 --> 00:12:34.251\nAnd I think that's what's going to happen.\n\n00:12:34.275 --> 00:12:36.423\nIn fact, it's already happening.\n\n00:12:36.447 --> 00:12:40.323\nThe dark net is no longer\na den for dealers\n\n00:12:40.347 --> 00:12:42.914\nand a hideout for whistle-blowers.\n\n00:12:42.938 --> 00:12:44.625\nIt's already going mainstream.\n\n00:12:45.656 --> 00:12:52.230\nJust recently, the musician Aphex Twin\nreleased his album as a dark net site.\n\n00:12:52.254 --> 00:12:56.207\nFacebook has started a dark net site.\n\n00:12:56.231 --> 00:12:59.864\nA group of London architects\nhave opened a dark net site\n\n00:12:59.888 --> 00:13:02.733\nfor people worried\nabout regeneration projects.\n\n00:13:02.757 --> 00:13:05.330\nYes, the dark net is going mainstream,\n\n00:13:05.354 --> 00:13:08.971\nand I predict that fairly soon,\nevery social media company,\n\n00:13:08.995 --> 00:13:10.430\nevery major news outlet,\n\n00:13:10.454 --> 00:13:13.538\nand therefore most of you\nin this audience,\n\n00:13:13.562 --> 00:13:15.918\nwill be using the dark net, too.\n\n00:13:16.900 --> 00:13:19.929\nSo the Internet is about to get\nmore interesting,\n\n00:13:19.953 --> 00:13:22.733\nmore exciting, more innovative,\n\n00:13:22.757 --> 00:13:24.482\nmore terrible,\n\n00:13:24.506 --> 00:13:25.860\nmore destructive.\n\n00:13:27.098 --> 00:13:29.371\nThat's good news\nif you care about liberty.\n\n00:13:29.395 --> 00:13:31.365\nIt's good news if you care about freedom.\n\n00:13:31.389 --> 00:13:33.508\nIt's good news if you care\nabout democracy.\n\n00:13:33.532 --> 00:13:34.910\nIt's also good news\n\n00:13:34.934 --> 00:13:37.380\nif you want to browse\nfor illegal pornography\n\n00:13:37.404 --> 00:13:39.733\nand if you want to buy and sell drugs\n\n00:13:39.757 --> 00:13:41.050\nwith impunity.\n\n00:13:41.834 --> 00:13:45.733\nNeither entirely dark, nor entirely light.\n\n00:13:45.757 --> 00:13:49.434\nIt's not one side or the other\nthat's going to win out, but both.\n\n00:13:50.310 --> 00:13:52.198\nThank you very much, indeed.\n\n00:13:52.198 --> 00:13:55.908\n(Applause)"}, {"title": "The mathematician who cracked Wall

mathematical phenom. You had already taught at Harvard and MIT at a young age. And then the NSA came calling. What was that about?Jim Simons: Well the NSA \u2014 that's the National Security Agency \u2014 they didn't exactly come calling. They had an operation at Princeton, where they hired mathematicians to attack secret codes and stuff like that. And I knew that existed. And they had a very good policy, because you could do half your time at your own mathematics, and at least half your time working on their stuff. And they paid a lot. So that was an irresistible pull. So, I went there.CA: You were a code-cracker.JS: I was.CA: Until you got fired.JS: Well, I did get fired. Yes.CA: How come?JS: Well, how come? I got fired because, well, the Vietnam War was on, and the boss of bosses in my organization was a big fan of the war and wrote a New York Times article, a magazine section cover story, about how we would win in Vietnam. And I didn't like that war, I thought it was stupid. And I wrote a letter to the Times, which they published, saying not everyone who works for Maxwell Taylor, if anyone remembers that name, agrees with his views. And I gave my own views ...CA: Oh, OK. I can see that would \u2014JS: ... which were different from General Taylor's. But in the end, nobody said anything. But then, I was 29 years old at this time, and some kid came around and said he was a stringer from Newsweek magazine and he wanted to interview me and ask what I was doing about my views. And I told him, \"I'm doing mostly mathematics now, and when the war is over, then I'll do mostly their stuff.\" Then I did the only intelligent thing I'd done that day \u2014 I told my local boss that I gave that interview. And he said, \"What'd you say?\" And I told him what I said. And then he said, \"I've got to call Taylor.\" He called Taylor; that took 10 minutes. I was fired five minutes after that.CA: OK.JS: But it wasn't bad.CA: It wasn't bad, because you went on to Stony Brook and stepped up your mathematical career. You started working with this man here. Who is this?JS: Oh, [Shiing-Shen] Chern. Chern was one of the great mathematicians of the century. I had known him when I was a graduate student at Berkeley. And I had some ideas, and I brought them to him and he liked them. Together, we did this work which you can easily see up there. There it is.CA: It led to you publishing a famous paper together. Can you explain at all what that work was?JS: No.(Laughter)JS: I mean, I could explain it to somebody.(Laughter)CA: How about explaining this?JS: But not many. Not many people.CA: I think you told me it had something to do with spheres, so let's start here.JS: Well, it did, but I'll say about that work \u2014 it did have something to do with that, but before we get to that \u2014 that work was good mathematics. I was very happy with it; so was Chern. It even started a little sub-field that's now flourishing. But, more interestingly, it happened to apply to physics, something we knew nothing about \u2014 at least I knew nothing about physics, and I don't think Chern knew a heck of a lot. And about 10 years after the paper came out, a guy named Ed Witten in Princeton started applying it to string theory and people in Russia started applying it to what's called \"condensed matter.\" Today, those things in there called Chern-Simons invariants have spread through a lot of physics. And it was amazing. We didn't know any physics. It never occurred to me that it would be applied to physics. But that's the thing about mathematics \u2014 you never know where it's going to go.CA: This is so incredible. So, we've been talking about how evolution shapes human minds that may or may not perceive the truth. Somehow, you come up with a mathematical theory, not knowing any physics, discover two decades later that it's being applied to profoundly describe the actual physical world. How can that happen?JS: God knows.(Laughter)But there's a famous physicist named [Eugene] Wigner, and he wrote an essay on the unreasonable effectiveness of mathematics. Somehow, this mathematics, which is rooted in the real world in some sense \u2014 we learn to count, measure, everyone would do that \u2014 and then it flourishes on its own. But so often it comes back to save the day. General relativity is an example. [Hermann] Minkowski had this geometry, and Einstein realized, \"Hey! It's the very thing in which I can cast general relativity.\" So, you never know. It is a mystery. It is a mystery.CA: So, here's a mathematical piece of ingenuity. Tell us about this.JS: Well, that's a ball \u2014 it's a sphere, and it has a lattice around it \u2014 you know, those squares. What I'm going to show here was originally observed by [Leonhard] Euler, the great mathematician, in the 1700s. And it gradually grew to be a very important field in mathematics: algebraic topology, geometry. That paper up there had its roots in this. So, here's this thing: it has eight vertices, 12 edges, six faces. And if you look at the difference \u2014 vertices minus edges plus faces \u2014 you get two. OK, well, two. That's a good number. Here's a different way of doing it \u2014 these are triangles covering \u2014 this has 12 vertices and 30 edges and 20 faces, 20 tiles. And vertices minus edges plus faces still equals two. And in fact, you could do this any which way \u2014 cover this thing with all kinds of polygons and triangles and mix them up. And you take vertices minus edges plus faces \u2014 you'll get two. Here's a different shape. This is a torus, or the surface of a doughnut: 16 vertices covered by these rectangles, 32 edges, 16 faces. Vertices minus edges comes out to be zero. It'll always come out to zero. Every time you cover a torus with squares or triangles or anything like that, you're going to get zero. So, this is called the Euler characteristic. And it's what's called a topological invariant. It's pretty amazing. No matter how you do it, you're always get the same answer. So that was the first sort of thrust, from the mid-1700s, into a subject which is now called algebraic topology.CA: And your own work took an idea like this and moved it into higher-dimensional theory, higher-dimensional objects, and found new invariances?JS: Yes. Well, there were already higher-dimensional invariants: Pontryagin classes \u2014 actually, there were Chern classes. There were a bunch of these types of invariants. I was struggling to work on one of them and model it sort of combinatorially, instead of the way it was typically done, and that led to this work and we uncovered some new things. But if it wasn't for Mr. Euler \u2014 who wrote almost 70 volumes of mathematics and had 13 children, who he apparently would dandle on his knee while he was writing \u2014 if it wasn't for Mr. Euler, there wouldn't perhaps be these invariants.CA: OK, so that's at least given us a flavor of that amazing mind in there. Let's talk about Renaissance. Because you took that amazing mind and having been a code-cracker at the NSA, you started to become a code-cracker in the financial industry. I think you probably didn't buy efficient market theory. Somehow you found a way of creating astonishing returns over two decades. The way it's been explained to me, what's remarkable about what you did wasn't just the size of the returns, it's that you took them with surprisingly low volatility and risk, compared with other hedge funds. So how on earth did you do this, Jim?JS: I did it by assembling a wonderful group of people. When I started doing trading, I had gotten a little tired of mathematics. I was in my late 30s, I had a little money. I started trading and it went very well. I made quite a lot of money with pure luck. I mean, I think it was pure luck. It certainly wasn't mathematical modeling. But in looking at the data, after a while I realized: it looks like there's some structure here. And I hired a few mathematicians, and we started making some models \u2014 just the kind of thing we did back at IDA [Institute for Defense Analyses]. You design an algorithm, you test it out on a computer. Does it work? Doesn't it work? And so on.CA: Can we take a look at this? Because here's a typical graph of some commodity. I look at that, and I say, \"That's just a random, up-and-down walk \u2014 maybe a slight upward trend over that whole period of time.\" How on earth could you trade looking at that, and see something that wasn't just random?JS: In the old days \u2014 this is kind of a graph from the old days, commodities or currencies had a tendency to trend. Not necessarily the very light trend you see here, but trending in periods. And if you decided, OK, I'm going to predict today, by the average move in the past 20 days \u2014 maybe that would be a good prediction, and I'd make some money. And in fact, years ago, such a system would work \u2014 not beautifully, but it would work. You'd make money, you'd lose money, you'd make money. But this is a year's worth of days, and you'd make a little money during that period. It's a very vestigial system.CA: So you would test a bunch of lengths of trends in time and see whether, for example, a 10-day trend or a 15-day trend was predictive of what happened next.JS: Sure, you would try all those things and see what worked best. Trend-following would have been great in the '60s, and it was sort of OK in the '70s. By the '80s, it wasn't.CA: Because everyone could see that. So, how did you stay ahead of the pack?JS: We stayed ahead of the pack by finding other approaches \u2014 shorter-term approaches to some extent. The real thing was to gather a tremendous amount of data \u2014 and we had to get it by hand in the early days. We went down to the Federal Reserve and copied interest rate histories and stuff like that, because it didn't exist on computers. We got a lot of data. And very smart people \u2014 that was the key. I didn't really know how to hire people to do fundamental trading. I had hired a few \u2014 some made money, some didn't make money. I couldn't make a business out of that. But I did know how to hire scientists, because I have some taste in that department. So, that's what we did. And gradually these models got better and better, and better and better.CA: You're credited with doing something remarkable at Renaissance, which is building this culture, this group of people, who weren't just hired guns who could be lured away by money. Their motivation was doing exciting mathematics and science.JS: Well, I'd hoped that might be true. But some of it was money.CA: They made a lot of money.JS: I can't say that no one came because of the money. I think a lot of them came because of the money. But they also came because it would be fun.CA: What role did machine learning play in all this?JS: In a certain sense, what we did was machine learning. You look at a lot of data, and you try to simulate different predictive schemes, until you get better and better at it. It doesn't necessarily feed back on itself the way we did things. But it worked.CA: So these different predictive schemes can be really quite wild and unexpected. I mean, you looked at everything, right? You looked at the weather, length of dresses, political opinion.JS: Yes, length of dresses we didn't try.CA: What sort of things?JS: Well, everything. Everything is grist for the mill \u2014 except hem lengths. Weather, annual reports, quarterly reports, historic data itself, volumes, you name it. Whatever there is. We take in terabytes of data a day. And store it away and massage it and get it ready for analysis. You're looking for anomalies. You're looking for \u2014 like you said, the efficient market hypothesis is not correct.CA: But any one anomaly might be just a random thing. So, is the secret here to just look at multiple strange anomalies, and see when they align?JS: Any one anomaly might be a random thing; however, if you have enough data you can tell that it's not. You can see an anomaly that's persistent for a sufficiently long time \u2014 the probability of it being random is not high. But these things fade after a while; anomalies can get washed out. So you have to keep on top of the business.CA: A lot of people look at the hedge fund industry now and are sort of ... shocked by it, by how much wealth is created there, and how much talent is going into it. Do you have any worries about that industry, and perhaps the financial industry in general? Kind of being on a runaway train that's \u2014 I don't know \u2014 helping increase inequality? How would you champion what's happening in the hedge fund industry?JS: I think in the last three or four years, hedge funds have not done especially well. We've done dandy, but the hedge fund industry as a whole has not done so wonderfully. The stock market has been on a roll, going up as everybody knows, and price-earnings ratios have grown. So an awful lot of the wealth that's been created in the last \u2014 let's say, five or six years \u2014 has not been created by hedge funds. People would ask me, \"What's a hedge fund?\" And I'd say, \"One and 20.\" Which means \u2014 now it's two and 20 \u2014 it's two percent fixed fee and 20 percent of profits. Hedge funds are all different kinds of creatures.CA: Rumor has it you charge slightly higher fees than that.JS: We charged the highest fees in the world at one time. Five and 44, that's what we charge.CA: Five and 44. So five percent flat, 44 percent of upside. You still made your investors spectacular amounts of money.JS: We made good returns, yes. People got very mad: \"How can you charge such high fees?\" I said, \"OK, you can withdraw.\" But \"How can I get more?\" was what people were \u2014(Laughter)But at a certain point, as I think I told you, we bought out all the investors because there's a capacity to the fund.CA: But should we worry about the hedge fund industry attracting too much of the world's great mathematical and other talent to work on that, as opposed to the many other problems in the world?JS: Well, it's not just mathematical. We hire astronomers and physicists and things like that. I don't think we should worry about it too much. It's still a pretty small industry. And in fact, bringing science into the investing world has improved that world. It's reduced volatility. It's increased liquidity. Spreads are narrower because people are trading that kind of stuff. So I'm not too worried about Einstein going off and starting a hedge fund.CA: You're at a phase in your life now where you're actually investing, though, at the other end of the supply chain \u2014 you're actually boosting mathematics across America. This is your wife, Marilyn. You're working on philanthropic issues together. Tell me about that.JS: Well, Marilyn started \u2014 there she is up there, my beautiful wife \u2014 she started the foundation about 20 years ago. I think '94. I claim it was '93, she says it was '94, but it was one of those two years.(Laughter)We started the foundation, just as a convenient way to give charity. She kept the books, and so on. We did not have a vision at that time, but gradually a vision emerged \u2014 which was to focus on math and science, to focus on basic research. And that's what we've done. Six years ago or so, I left Renaissance and went to work at the foundation. So that's what we do.CA: And so Math for America is basically investing in math teachers around the country, giving them some extra income, giving them support and coaching. And really trying to make that more effective and make that a calling to which teachers can aspire.JS: Yeah \u2014 instead of beating up the bad teachers, which has created morale problems all through the educational community, in particular in math and science, we focus on celebrating the good ones and giving them status. Yeah, we give them extra money, 15,000 dollars a year. We have 800 math and science teachers in New York City in public schools today, as part of a core. There's a great morale among them. They're staying in the field. Next year, it'll be 1,000 and that'll be 10 percent of the math and science teachers in New York [City] public schools.(Applause)CA: Jim, here's another project that you've supported philanthropically: Research into origins of life, I guess. What are we looking at here? JS: Well, I'll save that for a second. And then I'll tell you what you're looking at. Origins of life is a fascinating question. How did we get here? Well, there are two questions: One is, what is the route from geology to biology \u2014 how did we get here? And the other question is, what did we start with? What material, if any, did we have to work with on this route? Those are two very, very interesting questions. The first question is a tortuous path from geology up to RNA or something like that \u2014 how did that all work? And the other, what do we have to work with? Well, more than we think. So what's pictured there is a star in formation. Now, every year in our Milky Way, which has 100 billion stars, about two new stars are created. Don't ask me how, but they're created. And it takes them about a million years to settle out. So, in steady state, there are about two million stars in formation at any time. That one is somewhere along this settling-down period. And there's all this crap sort of circling around it, dust and stuff. And it'll form probably a solar system, or whatever it forms. But here's the thing \u2014 in this dust that surrounds a forming star have been found, now, significant organic molecules. Molecules not just like methane, but formaldehyde and cyanide \u2014 things that are the building blocks \u2014 the seeds, if you will \u2014 of life. So, that may be typical. And it may be typical that planets around the universe start off with some of these basic building blocks. Now does that mean there's going to be life all around? Maybe. But it's a question of how tortuous this path is from those frail beginnings, those seeds, all the way to life. And most of those seeds will fall on fallow planets.CA: So for you, personally, finding an answer to this question of where we came from, of how did this thing happen, that is something you would love to see.JS: Would love to see. And like to know \u2014 if that path is tortuous enough, and so improbable, that no matter what you start with, we could be a singularity. But on the other hand, given all this organic dust that's floating around, we could have lots of friends out there. It'd be great to know.CA: Jim, a couple of years ago, I got the chance to speak with Elon Musk, and I asked him the secret of his success, and he said taking physics seriously was it. Listening to you, what I hear you saying is taking math seriously, that has infused your whole life. It's made you an absolute fortune, and now it's allowing you to invest in the futures of thousands and thousands of kids across America and elsewhere. Could it be that science actually works? That math actually works?JS: Well, math certainly works. Math certainly works. But this has been fun. Working with Marilyn and giving it away has been very enjoyable.CA: I just find it \u2014 it's an inspirational thought to me, that by taking knowledge seriously, so much more can come from it.

Because everyone could see that.\n\n00:11:23.741 --> 00:11:26.523\nSo, how did you stay ahead of the pack?\n\n00:11:27.004 --> 00:11:33.136\nJS: We stayed ahead of the pack\nby finding other approaches --\n\n00:11:33.160 --> 00:11:35.901\nshorter-term approaches to some extent.\n\n00:11:37.065 --> 00:11:40.412\nThe real thing was to gather\na tremendous amount of data --\n\n00:11:40.436 --> 00:11:44.014\nand we had to get it by hand\nin the early days.\n\n00:11:44.038 --> 00:11:47.504\nWe went down to the Federal Reserve\nand copied interest rate histories\n\n00:11:47.528 --> 00:11:50.793\nand stuff like that,\nbecause it didn't exist on computers.\n\n00:11:50.817 --> 00:11:52.460\nWe got a lot of data.\n\n00:11:52.484 --> 00:11:56.644\nAnd very smart people -- that was the key.\n\n00:11:57.421 --> 00:12:01.197\nI didn't really know how to hire\npeople to do fundamental trading.\n\n00:12:01.707 --> 00:12:04.656\nI had hired a few -- some made money,\nsome didn't make money.\n\n00:12:04.680 --> 00:12:06.560\nI couldn't make a business out of that.\n\n00:12:06.584 --> 00:12:08.626\nBut I did know how to hire scientists,\n\n00:12:08.650 --> 00:12:12.039\nbecause I have some taste\nin that department.\n\n00:12:12.063 --> 00:12:13.901\nSo, that's what we did.\n\n00:12:13.925 --> 00:12:17.156\nAnd gradually these models\ngot better and better,\n\n00:12:17.180 --> 00:12:18.515\nand better and better.\n\n00:12:18.539 --> 00:12:21.753\nCA: You're credited with doing\nsomething remarkable at Renaissance,\n\n00:12:21.777 --> 00:12:24.378\nwhich is building this culture,\nthis group of people,\n\n00:12:24.402 --> 00:12:27.544\nwho weren't just hired guns\nwho could be lured away by money.\n\n00:12:27.568 --> 00:12:31.480\nTheir motivation was doing\nexciting mathematics and science.\n\n00:12:31.818 --> 00:12:34.217\nJS: Well, I'd hoped that might be true.\n\n00:12:34.241 --> 00:12:37.821\nBut some of it was money.\n\n00:12:37.845 --> 00:12:39.238\nCA: They made a lot of money.\n\n00:12:39.262 --> 00:12:41.799\nJS: I can't say that no one came\nbecause of the money.\n\n00:12:41.823 --> 00:12:44.076\nI think a lot of them\ncame because of the money.\n\n00:12:44.100 --> 00:12:46.121\nBut they also came\nbecause it would be fun.\n\n00:12:46.145 --> 00:12:48.633\nCA: What role did machine learning\nplay in all this?\n\n00:12:48.657 --> 00:12:51.721\nJS: In a certain sense,\nwhat we did was machine learning.\n\n00:12:52.837 --> 00:12:59.128\nYou look at a lot of data, and you try\nto simulate different predictive schemes,\n\n00:12:59.152 --> 00:13:01.334\nuntil you get better and better at it.\n\n00:13:01.358 --> 00:13:05.125\nIt doesn't necessarily feed back on itself\nthe way we did things.\n\n00:13:05.149 --> 00:13:07.458\nBut it worked.\n\n00:13:08.108 --> 00:13:12.167\nCA: So these different predictive schemes\ncan be really quite wild and unexpected.\n\n00:13:12.191 --> 00:13:14.105\nI mean, you looked at everything, right?\n\n00:13:14.129 --> 00:13:17.446\nYou looked at the weather,\nlength of dresses, political opinion.\n\n00:13:17.470 --> 00:13:20.307\nJS: Yes, length of dresses we didn't try.\n\n00:13:20.331 --> 00:13:22.388\nCA: What sort of things?\n\n00:13:22.412 --> 00:13:23.570\nJS: Well, everything.\n\n00:13:23.594 --> 00:13:26.858\nEverything is grist for the mill --\nexcept hem lengths.\n\n00:13:28.810 --> 00:13:31.110\nWeather, annual reports,\n\n00:13:31.134 --> 00:13:35.866\nquarterly reports, historic data itself,\nvolumes, you name it.\n\n00:13:35.890 --> 00:13:37.041\nWhatever there is.\n\n00:13:37.065 --> 00:13:39.686\nWe take in terabytes of data a day.\n\n00:13:39.710 --> 00:13:43.834\nAnd store it away and massage it\nand get it ready for analysis.\n\n00:13:45.404 --> 00:13:46.786\nYou're looking for anomalies.\n\n00:13:46.810 --> 00:13:49.763\nYou're looking for -- like you said,\n\n00:13:49.787 --> 00:13:52.239\nthe efficient market\nhypothesis is not correct.\n\n00:13:52.263 --> 00:13:55.730\nCA: But any one anomaly\nmight be just a random thing.\n\n00:13:55.754 --> 00:13:59.412\nSo, is the secret here to just look\nat multiple strange anomalies,\n\n00:13:59.436 --> 00:14:00.764\nand see when they align?\n\n00:14:01.196 --> 00:14:04.409\nJS: Any one anomaly\nmight be a random thing;\n\n00:14:04.433 --> 00:14:07.472\nhowever, if you have enough data\nyou can tell that it's not.\n\n00:14:07.496 --> 00:14:12.446\nYou can see an anomaly that's persistent\nfor a sufficiently long time --\n\n00:14:12.470 --> 00:14:17.445\nthe probability of it being\nrandom is not high.\n\n00:14:17.469 --> 00:14:22.327\nBut these things fade after a while;\nanomalies can get washed out.\n\n00:14:22.351 --> 00:14:24.771\nSo you have to keep on top\nof the business.\n\n00:14:24.795 --> 00:14:27.467\nCA: A lot of people look\nat the hedge fund industry now\n\n00:14:27.491 --> 00:14:31.889\nand are sort of

you have any worries\nabout that industry,\n\n00:14:41.511 --> 00:14:43.925\nand perhaps the financial\nindustry in general?\n\n00:14:43.949 --> 00:14:46.653\nKind of being on a runaway train that's --\n\n00:14:46.677 --> 00:14:50.707\nI don't know --\nhelping increase inequality?\n\n00:14:50.731 --> 00:14:54.562\nHow would you champion what's happening\nin the hedge fund industry?\n\n00:14:54.586 --> 00:14:57.194\nJS: I think in the last\nthree or four years,\n\n00:14:57.218 --> 00:14:59.321\nhedge funds have not done especially well.\n\n00:14:59.345 --> 00:15:00.745\nWe've done dandy,\n\n00:15:00.769 --> 00:15:04.770\nbut the hedge fund industry as a whole\nhas not done so wonderfully.\n\n00:15:04.794 --> 00:15:09.696\nThe stock market has been on a roll,\ngoing up as everybody knows,\n\n00:15:09.720 --> 00:15:13.165\nand price-earnings ratios have grown.\n\n00:15:13.189 --> 00:15:16.252\nSo an awful lot of the wealth\nthat's been created in the last --\n\n00:15:16.276 --> 00:15:19.626\nlet's say, five or six years --\nhas not been created by hedge funds.\n\n00:15:20.416 --> 00:15:23.637\nPeople would ask me,\n\"What's a hedge fund?\"\n\n00:15:23.661 --> 00:15:25.921\nAnd I'd say, \"One and 20.\"\n\n00:15:25.945 --> 00:15:29.511\nWhich means -- now it's two and 20 --\n\n00:15:29.535 --> 00:15:32.888\nit's two percent fixed fee\nand 20 percent of profits.\n\n00:15:32.912 --> 00:15:35.264\nHedge funds are all\ndifferent kinds of creatures.\n\n00:15:35.288 --> 00:15:38.527\nCA: Rumor has it you charge\nslightly higher fees than that.\n\n00:15:39.297 --> 00:15:42.378\nJS: We charged the highest fees\nin the world at one time.\n\n00:15:42.402 --> 00:15:45.628\nFive and 44, that's what we charge.\n\n00:15:45.652 --> 00:15:47.050\nCA: Five and 44.\n\n00:15:47.074 --> 00:15:50.308\nSo five percent flat,\n44 percent of upside.\n\n00:15:50.332 --> 00:15:53.115\nYou still made your investors\nspectacular amounts of money.\n\n00:15:53.139 --> 00:15:54.591\nJS: We made good returns, yes.\n\n00:15:54.615 --> 00:15:57.615\nPeople got very mad:\n\"How can you charge such high fees?\"\n\n00:15:57.639 --> 00:15:59.266\nI said, \"OK, you can withdraw.\"\n\n00:15:59.290 --> 00:16:02.108\nBut \"How can I get more?\"\nwas what people were --\n\n00:16:02.132 --> 00:16:03.636\n(Laughter)\n\n00:16:03.660 --> 00:16:06.100\nBut at a certain point,\nas I think I told you,\n\n00:16:06.124 --> 00:16:11.299\nwe bought out all the investors\nbecause there's a capacity to the fund.\n\n00:16:11.323 -->

astronomers and physicists\nand things like that.\n\n00:16:27.791 --> 00:16:30.222\nI don't think we should worry\nabout it too much.\n\n00:16:30.246 --> 00:16:33.388\nIt's still a pretty small industry.\n\n00:16:33.412 --> 00:16:39.409\nAnd in fact, bringing science\ninto the investing world\n\n00:16:39.433 --> 00:16:41.592\nhas improved that world.\n\n00:16:41.616 --> 00:16:45.686\nIt's reduced volatility.\nIt's increased liquidity.\n\n00:16:45.710 --> 00:16:48.899\nSpreads are narrower because\npeople are trading that kind of stuff.\n\n00:16:48.923 --> 00:16:53.999\nSo I'm not too

00:19:22.642\nOrigins of life is a fascinating question.\n\n00:19:22.666 --> 00:19:24.199\nHow did we get here?\n\n00:19:25.128 --> 00:19:26.899\nWell, there are two questions:\n\n00:19:26.923 --> 00:19:32.791\nOne is, what is the route\nfrom geology to biology --\n\n00:19:32.815 --> 00:19:34.196\nhow did we get here?\n\n00:19:34.220 --> 00:19:36.584\nAnd the other question is,\nwhat did we start with?\n\n00:19:36.608 --> 00:19:39.710\nWhat material, if any,\ndid we have to work with on this route?\n\n00:19:39.734 --> 00:19:42.795\nThose are two very,\nvery interesting questions.\n\n00:19:43.731 --> 00:19:49.565\nThe first question is a tortuous path\nfrom geology up to RNA\n\n00:19:49.589 --> 00:19:51.847\nor something like that --\nhow did that all work?\n\n00:19:51.871 --> 00:19:54.259\nAnd the other,\nwhat do we have to work with?\n\n00:19:54.283 --> 00:19:56.054\nWell, more than we think.\n\n00:19:56.078 --> 00:20:00.921\nSo what's pictured there\nis a star in formation.\n\n00:20:01.794 --> 00:20:05.219\nNow, every year in our Milky Way,\nwhich has 100 billion stars,\n\n00:20:05.243 --> 00:20:07.738\nabout two new stars are created.\n\n00:20:07.762 --> 00:20:10.232\nDon't ask me how, but they're created.\n\n00:20:10.256 --> 00:20:13.336\nAnd it takes them about a million\nyears to settle out.\n\n00:20:14.090 --> 00:20:16.266\nSo, in steady state,\n\n00:20:16.290 --> 00:20:20.138\nthere are about two million stars\nin formation at any time.\n\n00:20:20.162 --> 00:20:23.620\nThat one is somewhere\nalong this settling-down period.\n\n00:20:24.025 --> 00:20:26.961\nAnd there's all this crap\nsort of circling around it,\n\n00:20:26.985 --> 00:20:28.483\ndust and stuff.\n\n00:20:29.437 --> 00:20:32.460\nAnd it'll form probably a solar system,\nor whatever it forms.\n\n00:20:32.484 --> 00:20:34.660\nBut here's the thing --\n\n00:20:34.684 --> 00:20:41.032\nin this dust that surrounds a forming star\n\n00:20:41.056 --> 00:20:47.091\nhave been found, now,\nsignificant organic molecules.\n\n00:20:47.916 --> 00:20:54.055\nMolecules not just like methane,\nbut formaldehyde and cyanide --\n\n00:20:54.079 --> 00:21:00.596\nthings that are the building blocks --\nthe seeds, if you will -- of life.\n\n00:21:01.094 --> 00:21:03.786\nSo, that may be typical.\n\n00:21:04.353 -->

Here's how I did it", "duration": "868", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/alan_eustace_i_leapt_from_the_stratosphere_here_s_how_i_did_it", "transcript": "So I grew up in Orlando, Florida. I was the son of an aerospace engineer. I lived and breathed the Apollo program. We either saw the launches from our backyard or we saw it by driving in the hour over to the Cape. I was impressed by, obviously, space and everything about it, but I was most impressed by the engineering that went into it.Behind me you see an amazing view, a picture that was taken from the International Space Station, and it shows a portion of our planet that's rarely seen and rarely studied and almost never explored. That place is called the stratosphere.If you start on the planet and you go up and up and up, it gets colder and colder and colder, until you reach the beginning of the stratosphere, and then an amazing thing happens. It gets colder at a much slower rate, and then it starts warming up, and then it gets warmer and warmer until the point where you can almost survive without any protection, about zero degrees, and then you end up getting colder and colder, and that's the top of the stratosphere. It is one of the least accessible places on our planet. Most often, when it's visited, it's by astronauts who are blazing up at it at probably several times the speed of sound, and they get a few seconds on the way up, and then they get this blazing ball of fire coming back in, on the way back in.But the question I asked is, is it possible to linger in the stratosphere? Is it possible to experience the stratosphere? Is it possible to explore the stratosphere?I studied this using my favorite search engine for quite a while, about a year, and then I made a scary phone call. It was a reference from a friend of mine to call Taber MacCallum from Paragon Space Development Corporation, and I asked him the question: is it possible to build a system to go into the stratosphere? And he said it was. And after a period of about three years, we proceeded to do just that. And on October 24 of last year, in this suit, I started on the ground, I went up in a balloon to 135,890 feet \u2014 but who's counting?(Laughter)Came back to Earth at speeds of up to 822 miles an hour. It was a four-minute and 27-second descent. And when I got to 10,000 feet, I opened a parachute and I landed.(Applause)But this is really a science talk, and it's really an engineering talk, and what was amazing to me about that experience is that Taber said, yes, I think we can build a stratospheric suit, and more than that, come down tomorrow and let's talk to the team that formed the core of the group that actually built it. And they did something which I think is important, which is they took the analogy of scuba diving. So in scuba diving, you have a self-contained system. You have everything that you could ever need. You have a scuba tank. You have a wetsuit. You have visibility. And that scuba is exactly this system, and we're going to launch it into the stratosphere.Three years later, this is what we have. We've got an amazing suit that was made by ILC Dover. ILC Dover was the company that made all of the Apollo suits and all of the extravehicular activity suits. They had never sold a suit commercially, only to the government, but they sold one to me, which I am very grateful for. Up here we have a parachute. This was all about safety. Everyone on the team knew that I have a wife and two small children \u2014 10 and 15 \u2014 and I wanted to come back safely. So there's a main parachute and a reserve parachute, and if I do nothing, the reserve parachute is going to open because of an automatic opening device. The suit itself can protect me from the cold. This area in the front here has thermal protection. It will actually heat water that will wrap around my body. It has two redundant oxygen tanks. Even if I was to get a quarter-inch hole in this suit, which is extremely unlikely, this system would still protect me from the low pressure of space.The main advantage of this system is weight and complexity. So the system weighs about 500 pounds, and if you compare it to the other attempt recently to go up in the stratosphere, they used a capsule. And to do a capsule, there's an amazing amount of complexity that goes into it, and it weighed about 3,000 pounds, and to raise 3,000 pounds to an altitude of 135,000 feet, which was my target altitude, it would have taken a balloon that was 45 to 50 million cubic feet. Because I only weighed 500 pounds in this system, we could do it with a balloon that was five times smaller than that, and that allowed us to use a launch system that was dramatically simpler than what needs to be done for a much larger balloon.So with that, I want to take you to Roswell, New Mexico, on October 24. We had an amazing team that got up in the middle of the night. And here's the suit. Again, this is using the front loader that you'll see in a second, and I want to play you a video of the actual launch. Roswell's a great place to launch balloons, but it's a fantastic place to land under a parachute, especially when you're going to land 70 miles away from the place you started. That's a helium truck in the background. It's darkness. I've already spent about an hour and a half pre-breathing. And then here you see the suit going on. It takes about an hour to get the suit on. Astronauts get this really nice air-conditioned van to go to the launch pad, but I got a front loader.(Laughter)You can see the top. You can see the balloon up there. That's where the helium is. This is Dave clearing the airspace with the FAA for 15 miles. And there we go.(Laughter)That's me waving with my left hand. The reason I'm waving with my left hand is because on the right hand is the emergency cutaway.(Laughter)My team forbade me from using my right hand. So the trip up is beautiful. It's kind of like Google Earth in reverse.(Laughter)It took two hours and seven minutes to go up, and it was the most peaceful two hours and seven minutes. I was mostly trying to relax. My heart rate was very low and I was trying not to use very much oxygen. You can see how the fields in the background are relatively big at this point, and you can see me going up and up.It's interesting here, because if you look, I'm right over the airport, and I'm probably at 50,000 feet, but immediately I'm about to go into a stratospheric wind of over 120 miles an hour. This is my flight director telling me that I had just gone higher than anybody else had ever gone in a balloon, and I was about 4,000 feet from release. This is what it looks like. You can see the darkness of space, the curvature of the Earth, the fragile planet below. I'm practicing my emergency procedures mentally right now. If anything goes wrong, I want to be ready. And the main thing that I want to do here is to have a release and fall and stay completely stable.(Video) Ground control. Everyone ready? Five. Four. Three. Two. One.Alan Eustace: There's the balloon going by, fully inflated at this point. And there you can see a drogue parachute, which I'll demonstrate in just a second, because that's really important. There's the balloon going by a second time. Right now, I'm about at the speed of sound. There's nothing for me to tell it's the speed of sound, and very soon I will actually be as fast as I ever get, 822 miles an hour.(Video) Ground control: We lost the data.AE: So now I'm down low right now and you can basically see the parachute come out right there. At this point, I'm very happy that there's a parachute out. I thought I was the only one happy, but it turns out mission control was really happy as well. The really nice thing about this is the moment I opened \u2014 I had a close of friend of mine, Blikkies, my parachute guy. He flew in another airplane, and he actually jumped out and landed right next to me. He was my wingman on the descent. This is my landing, but it's probably more properly called a crash.(Laughter)I hate to admit it, but this wasn't even close to my worst landing.(Laughter)(Applause)(Video) Man: How are you doing?AE: Hi there! Yay.(Laughter)So I want to tell you one thing that you might not have seen in that video, but one of the most critical parts of the entire thing was the release and what happens right after you release. And what we tried to do was use something called a drogue parachute, and a drogue parachute was there to stabilize me. And I'll show you one of those right now. If any of you have ever gone tandem skydiving, you probably used one of these. But the problem with one of these things is right when you release, you're in zero gravity. So it's very easy for this to just turn right around you. And before you know it, you can be tangled up or spinning, or you can release this drogue late, in which case what happens is you're going down at 800 miles an hour, and this thing is going to destroy itself and not be very useful. But the guys at United Parachute Technologies came up with this idea, and it was a roll that looks like that, but watch what happens when I pull it out. It's forming a pipe. This pipe is so solid that you can take this drogue parachute and wrap it around, and there's no way it will ever tangle with you. And that prevented a very serious potential problem.So nothing is possible without an amazing team of people. The core of this was about 20 people that worked on this for the three years, and they were incredible. People asked me what the best part of this whole thing was, and it was a chance to work with the best experts in meteorology and ballooning and parachute technology and environmental systems and high altitude medicine. It was fantastic. It's an engineer's dream to work with that group of people. And I also at the same time wanted to thank my friends at Google, both for supporting me during this effort and also covering for me in the times that I was away. But there's one other group I wanted to thank, and that's my family. Yay.(Applause)I would constantly give them speeches about the safety of technology, and they weren't hearing any of it. It was super hard on them, and the only reason that my wife put up with it was because I came back incredibly happy after each of the 250 tests, and she didn't want to take that away from me. So I want to close with a story. My daughter Katelyn, my 15-year-old, she and I were in the car, and we were driving down the road, and she was sitting there, and she had this idea, and she goes, \"Dad, I've got this idea.\" And so I listened to her idea and I said, \"Katelyn, that's impossible.\" And she looks at me and she goes, \"Dad, after what you just did, how can you call anything impossible?\" And I laughed, and I said, \"OK, it's not impossible, it's just very, very hard.\" And then I paused for a second, and I said, \"Katelyn, it may not be impossible, it may not even be very, very hard, it's just that I don't know how to do it.\"Thank you.(Applause)", "id": 2259, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:12.758 --> 00:00:15.934\nSo I grew up in Orlando,

00:04:54.574\nwhich is extremely unlikely,\n\n00:04:54.598 --> 00:04:58.398\nthis system would still protect me\nfrom the low pressure of space.\n\n00:04:59.278 --> 00:05:02.934\nThe main advantage of this system\nis weight and complexity.\n\n00:05:02.958 --> 00:05:05.934\nSo the system weighs about 500 pounds,\n\n00:05:05.958 --> 00:05:09.774\nand if you compare it to the other attempt\nrecently to go up in the stratosphere,\n\n00:05:09.798 --> 00:05:11.054\nthey used a capsule.\n\n00:05:11.078 --> 00:05:15.054\nAnd to do a capsule, there's an amazing\namount of complexity that goes into it,\n\n00:05:15.078 --> 00:05:17.014\nand it weighed about 3,000 pounds,\n\n00:05:17.038 --> 00:05:21.734\nand to raise 3,000 pounds\nto an altitude of 135,000 feet,\n\n00:05:21.758 --> 00:05:23.894\nwhich was my target altitude,\n\n00:05:23.918 --> 00:05:29.078\nit would have taken a balloon\nthat was 45 to 50 million cubic feet.\n\n00:05:30.798 --> 00:05:34.134\nBecause I only weighed\n500 pounds in this system,\n\n00:05:34.158 --> 00:05:37.374\nwe could do it with a balloon\nthat was five times smaller than that,\n\n00:05:37.398 --> 00:05:41.814\nand that allowed us to use a launch system\nthat was dramatically simpler\n\n00:05:41.838 --> 00:05:44.478\nthan what needs to be done\nfor a much larger balloon.\n\n00:05:45.438 --> 00:05:50.094\nSo with that, I want to take you\nto Roswell, New Mexico, on October 24.\n\n00:05:50.118 --> 00:05:53.814\nWe had an amazing team\nthat got up in the middle of the night.\n\n00:05:53.838 --> 00:05:56.414\nAnd here's the suit.\n\n00:05:56.438 --> 00:05:59.574\nAgain, this is using the front loader\nthat you'll see in a second,\n\n00:05:59.598 --> 00:06:02.814\nand I want to play you a video\nof the actual launch.\n\n00:06:02.838 --> 00:06:04.854\nRoswell's a great place\nto launch balloons,\n\n00:06:04.878 --> 00:06:08.054\nbut it's a fantastic place\nto land under a parachute,\n\n00:06:08.078 --> 00:06:12.478\nespecially when you're going to land\n70 miles away from the place you started.\n\n00:06:13.598 --> 00:06:15.638\nThat's a helium truck in the background.\n\n00:06:16.318 --> 00:06:17.574\nIt's darkness.\n\n00:06:17.598 --> 00:06:20.814\nI've already spent about an hour\nand a half pre-breathing.\n\n00:06:20.838 --> 00:06:23.238\nAnd then here you see the suit going on.\n\n00:06:24.918 --> 00:06:27.198\nIt takes about an hour to get the suit on.\n\n00:06:29.438 --> 00:06:33.174\nAstronauts get this really nice\nair-conditioned van\n\n00:06:33.198 --> 00:06:35.774\nto go to the launch pad,\nbut I got a front loader.\n\n00:06:35.798 --> 00:06:37.974\n(Laughter)\n\n00:06:37.998 --> 00:06:40.534\nYou can see the top.\nYou can see the balloon up there.\n\n00:06:40.558 --> 00:06:42.078\nThat's where the helium is.\n\n00:06:44.598 --> 00:06:48.238\nThis is Dave clearing the airspace\nwith the FAA for 15 miles.\n\n00:06:52.318 --> 00:06:53.518\nAnd there we go.\n\n00:06:56.478 --> 00:06:58.174\n(Laughter)\n\n00:06:58.198 --> 00:06:59.894\nThat's me waving with my left hand.\n\n00:06:59.918 --> 00:07:01.974\nThe reason I'm waving with my left hand\n\n00:07:01.998 --> 00:07:04.654\nis because on the right hand\nis the emergency cutaway.\n\n00:07:04.678 --> 00:07:06.254\n(Laughter)\n\n00:07:06.278 --> 00:07:09.118\nMy team forbade me\nfrom using my right hand.\n\n00:07:11.238 --> 00:07:14.574\nSo the trip up is beautiful.\nIt's kind of like Google Earth in reverse.\n\n00:07:14.598 --> 00:07:17.414\n(Laughter)\n\n00:07:17.438 --> 00:07:19.534\nIt took two hours\nand seven minutes to go up,\n\n00:07:19.558 --> 00:07:22.294\nand it was the most peaceful\ntwo hours and seven minutes.\n\n00:07:22.318 --> 00:07:24.198\nI was mostly trying to relax.\n\n00:07:25.878 --> 00:07:27.894\nMy heart rate was very low\n\n00:07:27.918 --> 00:07:30.038\nand I was trying not to use\nvery much oxygen.\n\n00:07:31.798 --> 00:07:34.534\nYou can see how the fields\nin the background\n\n00:07:34.558 --> 00:07:36.174\nare relatively big at this point,\n\n00:07:36.198 --> 00:07:38.254\nand you can see me going up and up.\n\n00:07:38.278 --> 00:07:40.294\nIt's interesting here,\nbecause if you look,\n\n00:07:40.318 --> 00:07:43.694\nI'm right over the airport,\nand I'm probably at 50,000 feet,\n\n00:07:43.718 --> 00:07:46.414\nbut immediately I'm about to go\ninto a stratospheric wind\n\n00:07:46.438 --> 00:07:48.158\nof over 120 miles an hour.\n\n00:07:51.398 --> 00:07:55.134\nThis is my flight director telling me\nthat I had just gone higher\n\n00:07:55.158 --> 00:07:57.374\nthan anybody else\nhad ever gone in a balloon,\n\n00:07:57.398 --> 00:08:01.078\nand I was about 4,000 feet from release.\n\n00:08:01.638 --> 00:08:02.998\nThis is what it looks like.\n\n00:08:06.198 --> 00:08:09.103\nYou can see the darkness of space,\nthe curvature of the Earth,\n\n00:08:10.038 --> 00:08:11.358\nthe fragile planet below.\n\n00:08:20.158 --> 00:08:23.358\nI'm practicing my emergency procedures\nmentally right now.\n\n00:08:24.598 --> 00:08:26.614\nIf anything goes wrong,\nI want to be ready.\n\n00:08:26.638 --> 00:08:28.814\nAnd the main thing that I want to do here\n\n00:08:28.838 --> 00:08:35.254\nis to have a release and fall\nand stay completely stable.\n\n00:08:35.278 --> 00:08:38.198\n(Video) Ground control. Everyone ready?\n\n00:08:43.678 --> 00:08:48.918\nFive. Four. Three. Two. One.\n\n00:08:59.798 --> 00:09:03.227\nAlan Eustace: There's the balloon\ngoing by, fully inflated at this point.\n\n00:09:04.636 --> 00:09:08.494\nAnd there you can see a drogue parachute,\nwhich I'll demonstrate in just a second,\n\n00:09:08.518 --> 00:09:10.094\nbecause that's really important.\n\n00:09:10.118 --> 00:09:12.118\nThere's the balloon\ngoing by a second time.\n\n00:09:21.158 --> 00:09:23.318\nRight now, I'm about\nat the speed of sound.\n\n00:09:24.598 --> 00:09:27.318\nThere's nothing for me to tell\nit's the speed of sound,\n\n00:09:27.838 --> 00:09:31.614\nand very soon I will actually be\nas fast as I ever get,\n\n00:09:31.638 --> 00:09:33.278\n822 miles an hour.\n\n00:09:49.158 --> 00:09:51.111\n(Video) Ground control: We lost the data.\n\n00:09:54.918 --> 00:09:56.534\nAE: So now I'm down low right now\n\n00:09:56.558 --> 00:10:01.854\nand you can basically see\nthe parachute come out right there.\n\n00:10:01.878 --> 00:10:04.640\nAt this point, I'm very happy\nthat there's a parachute out.\n\n00:10:05.747 --> 00:10:07.414\nI thought I was the only one happy,\n\n00:10:07.438 --> 00:10:10.774\nbut it turns out mission control\nwas really happy as well.\n\n00:10:10.798 --> 00:10:13.894\nThe really nice thing about this\nis the moment I opened --\n\n00:10:13.918 --> 00:10:17.294\nI had a close of friend of mine,\nBlikkies, my parachute guy.\n\n00:10:17.318 --> 00:10:20.254\nHe flew in another airplane,\nand he actually jumped out\n\n00:10:20.278 --> 00:10:22.254\nand landed right next to me.\n\n00:10:22.278 --> 00:10:25.534\nHe was my wingman on the descent.\n\n00:10:25.558 --> 00:10:30.774\nThis is my landing, but it's probably more\nproperly called a crash.\n\n00:10:30.798 --> 00:10:35.014\n(Laughter)\n\n00:10:35.038 --> 00:10:38.494\nI hate to admit it, but this wasn't\neven close to my worst landing.\n\n00:10:38.518 --> 00:10:41.374\n(Laughter)\n\n00:10:41.398 --> 00:10:46.718\n(Applause)\n\n00:11:00.118 --> 00:11:01.614\n(Video) Man: How are you doing?\n\n00:11:01.638 --> 00:11:02.918\nAE: Hi there!\n\n00:11:07.238 --> 00:11:08.454\nYay.\n\n00:11:08.478 --> 00:11:10.774\n(Laughter)\n\n00:11:10.798 --> 00:11:12.294\nSo I want to tell you one thing\n\n00:11:12.318 --> 00:11:14.614\nthat you might not have seen\nin that video,\n\n00:11:14.638 --> 00:11:18.494\nbut one of the most critical parts\nof the entire thing was the release\n\n00:11:18.518 --> 00:11:21.374\nand what happens right after you release.\n\n00:11:21.398 --> 00:11:25.694\nAnd what we tried to do was use\nsomething called a drogue parachute,\n\n00:11:25.718 --> 00:11:28.414\nand a drogue parachute\nwas there to stabilize me.\n\n00:11:28.438 --> 00:11:30.494\nAnd I'll show you one of those right now.\n\n00:11:30.518 --> 00:11:33.158\nIf any of you have ever\ngone tandem skydiving,\n\n00:11:34.078 --> 00:11:35.598\nyou probably used one of these.\n\n00:11:38.158 --> 00:11:40.094\nBut the problem with one of these things\n\n00:11:40.118 --> 00:11:43.054\nis right when you release,\nyou're in zero gravity.\n\n00:11:43.078 --> 00:11:46.694\nSo it's very easy for this\nto just turn right around you.\n\n00:11:46.718 --> 00:11:49.998\nAnd before you know it,\nyou can be tangled up or spinning,\n\n00:11:51.278 --> 00:11:53.934\nor you can release this drogue late,\n\n00:11:53.958 --> 00:11:58.014\nin which case what happens\nis you're going down at 800 miles an hour,\n\n00:11:58.038 --> 00:12:00.534\nand this thing is going to destroy itself\n\n00:12:00.558 --> 00:12:01.758\nand not be very useful.\n\n00:12:03.358 --> 00:12:07.654\nBut the guys at United Parachute\nTechnologies came up with this idea,\n\n00:12:07.678 --> 00:12:09.614\nand it was a roll that looks like that,\n\n00:12:09.638 --> 00:12:12.318\nbut watch what happens when I pull it out.\n\n00:12:13.518 --> 00:12:15.118\nIt's forming a pipe.\n\n00:12:16.638 --> 00:12:18.838\nThis pipe is so solid\n\n00:12:20.318 --> 00:12:24.094\nthat you can take this drogue parachute\nand wrap it around,\n\n00:12:24.118 --> 00:12:26.438\nand there's no way\nit will ever tangle with you.\n\n00:12:27.638 --> 00:12:30.878\nAnd that prevented\na very serious potential problem.\n\n00:12:31.518 --> 00:12:34.454\nSo nothing is possible\nwithout an amazing team of people.\n\n00:12:34.478 --> 00:12:36.934\nThe core of this was about 20 people\n\n00:12:36.958 --> 00:12:39.054\nthat worked on this for the three years,\n\n00:12:39.078 --> 00:12:40.694\nand they were incredible.\n\n00:12:40.718 --> 00:12:43.494\nPeople asked me what the best part\nof this whole thing was,\n\n00:12:43.518 --> 00:12:45.974\nand it was a chance\nto work with the best experts\n\n00:12:45.998 --> 00:12:50.614\nin meteorology and ballooning\nand parachute technology\n\n00:12:50.638 --> 00:12:55.094\nand environmental systems\nand high altitude medicine.\n\n00:12:55.118 --> 00:12:59.254\nIt was fantastic. It's an engineer's dream\nto work with that group of people.\n\n00:12:59.278 --> 00:13:02.534\nAnd I also at the same time\nwanted to thank my friends at Google,\n\n00:13:02.558 --> 00:13:05.414\nboth for supporting me during this effort\n\n00:13:05.438 --> 00:13:08.734\nand also covering for me\nin the times that I was away.\n\n00:13:08.758 --> 00:13:12.054\nBut there's one other group\nI wanted to thank, and that's my family.\n\n00:13:12.078 --> 00:13:13.294\nYay.\n\n00:13:13.318 --> 00:13:19.534\n(Applause)\n\n00:13:19.558 --> 00:13:23.254\nI would constantly give them speeches\nabout the safety of technology,\n\n00:13:23.278 --> 00:13:25.478\nand they weren't hearing any of it.\n\n00:13:27.038 --> 00:13:28.414\nIt was super hard on them,\n\n00:13:28.438 --> 00:13:31.014\nand the only reason\nthat my wife put up with it\n\n00:13:31.038 --> 00:13:36.534\nwas because I came back incredibly happy\nafter each of the 250 tests,\n\n00:13:36.558 --> 00:13:38.734\nand she didn't want\nto take that away from me.\n\n00:13:38.758 --> 00:13:40.534\nSo I want to close with a story.\n\n00:13:40.558 --> 00:13:45.134\nMy daughter Katelyn, my 15-year-old,\nshe and I were in the car,\n\n00:13:45.158 --> 00:13:48.614\nand we were driving down the road,\nand she was sitting there,\n\n00:13:48.638 --> 00:13:52.014\nand she had this idea, and she goes,\n\"Dad, I've got this idea.\"\n\n00:13:52.038 --> 00:13:56.558\nAnd so I listened to her idea\nand I said, \"Katelyn, that's impossible.\"\n\n00:13:57.278 --> 00:13:58.894\nAnd she looks at me\n\n00:13:58.918 --> 00:14:02.254\nand she goes, \"Dad,\nafter what you just did,\n\n00:14:02.278 --> 00:14:04.678\nhow can you call anything impossible?\"\n\n00:14:05.718 --> 00:14:08.974\nAnd I laughed, and I said,\n\"OK, it's not impossible,\n\n00:14:08.998 --> 00:14:11.398\nit's just very, very hard.\"\n\n00:14:12.798 --> 00:14:15.694\nAnd then I paused for a second,\nand I said, \"Katelyn,\n\n00:14:15.718 --> 00:14:19.454\nit may not be impossible,\nit may not even be very, very hard,\n\n00:14:19.478 --> 00:14:22.254\nit's just that I don't know how to do it.\"\n\n00:14:22.278 --> 00:14:23.494\nThank you.\n\n00:14:23.518 --> 00:14:27.598\n(Applause)"}, {"title": "The way we think about work is broken", "duration": "482", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/barry_schwartz_the_way_we_think_about_work_is_broken", "transcript": "Today I'm going to talk about work. And the question I want to ask and answer is this: \"Why do we work?\" Why do we drag ourselves out of bed every morning instead of living our lives just filled with bouncing from one TED-like adventure to another?(Laughter)You may be asking yourselves that very question. Now, I know of course, we have to make a living, but nobody in this room thinks that that's the answer to the question, \"Why do we work?\" For folks in this room, the work we do is challenging, it's engaging, it's stimulating, it's meaningful. And if we're lucky, it might even be important.So, we wouldn't work if we didn't get paid, but that's not why we do what we do. And in general, I think we think that material rewards are a pretty bad reason for doing the work that we do. When we say of somebody that he's \"in it for the money,\" we are not just being descriptive.(Laughter)Now, I think this is totally obvious, but the very obviousness of it raises what is for me an incredibly profound question. Why, if this is so obvious, why is it that for the overwhelming majority of people on the planet, the work they do has none of the characteristics that get us up and out of bed and off to the office every morning? How is it that we allow the majority of people on the planet to do work that is monotonous, meaningless and soul-deadening? Why is it that as capitalism developed, it created a mode of production, of goods and services, in which all the nonmaterial satisfactions that might come from work were eliminated? Workers who do this kind of work, whether they do it in factories, in call centers, or in fulfillment warehouses, do it for pay. There is certainly no other earthly reason to do what they do except for pay.So the question is, \"Why?\" And here's the answer: the answer is technology. Now, I know, I know \u2014 yeah, yeah, yeah, technology, automation screws people, blah blah \u2014 that's not what I mean. I'm not talking about the kind of technology that has enveloped our lives, and that people come to TED to hear about. I'm not talking about the technology of things, profound though that is. I'm talking about another technology. I'm talking about the technology of ideas. I call it, \"idea technology\" \u2014 how clever of me.(Laughter)In addition to creating things, science creates ideas. Science creates ways of understanding. And in the social sciences, the ways of understanding that get created are ways of understanding ourselves. And they have an enormous influence on how we think, what we aspire to, and how we act.If you think your poverty is God's will, you pray. If you think your poverty is the result of your own inadequacy, you shrink into despair. And if you think your poverty is the result of oppression and domination, then you rise up in revolt. Whether your response to poverty is resignation or revolution, depends on how you understand the sources of your poverty. This is the role that ideas play in shaping us as human beings, and this is why idea technology may be the most profoundly important technology that science gives us.And there's something special about idea technology, that makes it different from the technology of things. With things, if the technology sucks, it just vanishes, right? Bad technology disappears. With ideas \u2014 false ideas about human beings will not go away if people believe that they're true. Because if people believe that they're true, they create ways of living and institutions that are consistent with these very false ideas.And that's how the industrial revolution created a factory system in which there was really nothing you could possibly get out of your day's work, except for the pay at the end of the day. Because the father \u2014 one of the fathers of the Industrial Revolution, Adam Smith \u2014 was convinced that human beings were by their very natures lazy, and wouldn't do anything unless you made it worth their while, and the way you made it worth their while was by incentivizing, by giving them rewards. That was the only reason anyone ever did anything. So we created a factory system consistent with that false view of human nature. But once that system of production was in place, there was really no other way for people to operate, except in a way that was consistent with Adam Smith's vision. So the work example is merely an example of how false ideas can create a circumstance that ends up making them true.It is not true that you \"just can't get good help anymore.\" It is true that you \"can't get good help anymore\" when you give people work to do that is demeaning and soulless. And interestingly enough, Adam Smith \u2014 the same guy who gave us this incredible invention of mass production, and division of labor \u2014 understood this. He said, of people who worked in assembly lines, of men who worked in assembly lines, he says: \"He generally becomes as stupid as it is possible for a human being to become.\" Now, notice the word here is \"become.\" \"He generally becomes as stupid as it is possible for a human being to become.\" Whether he intended it or not, what Adam Smith was telling us there, is that the very shape of the institution within which people work creates people who are fitted to the demands of that institution and deprives people of the opportunity to derive the kinds of satisfactions from their work that we take for granted.The thing about science \u2014 natural science \u2014 is that we can spin fantastic theories about the cosmos, and have complete confidence that the cosmos is completely indifferent to our theories. It's going to work the same damn way no matter what theories we have about the cosmos. But we do have to worry about the theories we have of human nature, because human nature will be changed by the theories we have that are designed to explain and help us understand human beings.The distinguished anthropologist, Clifford Geertz, said, years ago, that human beings are the \"unfinished animals.\" And what he meant by that was that it is only human nature to have a human nature that is very much the product of the society in which people live. That human nature, that is to say our human nature, is much more created than it is discovered. We design human nature by designing the institutions within which people live and work.And so you people \u2014 pretty much the closest I ever get to being with masters of the universe \u2014 you people should be asking yourself a question, as you go back home to run your organizations. Just what kind of human nature do you want to help design?Thank you.(Applause)Thanks.", "id": 2324, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:12.158 --> 00:00:14.188\nToday I'm going to talk about work.\n\n00:00:15.088 --> 00:00:18.138\nAnd the question I want to ask\nand answer is this:\n\n00:00:18.148 --> 00:00:20.078\n\"Why do we work?\"\n\n00:00:21.098 --> 00:00:25.018\nWhy do we drag ourselves\nout of bed every morning\n\n00:00:25.028 --> 00:00:27.058\ninstead of living our lives\n\n00:00:27.068 --> 00:00:32.138\njust filled with bouncing from one\nTED-like adventure to another?\n\n00:00:32.148 --> 00:00:33.968\n(Laughter)\n\n00:00:33.968 --> 00:00:37.038\nYou may be asking yourselves\nthat very question.\n\n00:00:37.048 --> 00:00:39.158\nNow, I know of course,\nwe have to make a living,\n\n00:00:39.168 --> 00:00:43.008\nbut nobody in this room thinks\nthat that's the answer to the question,\n\n00:00:43.018 --> 00:00:44.058\n\"Why do we work?\"\n\n00:00:44.068 --> 00:00:48.058\nFor folks in this room,\nthe work we do is challenging,\n\n00:00:48.068 --> 00:00:51.968\nit's engaging, it's stimulating,\nit's meaningful.\n\n00:00:51.978 --> 00:00:55.028\nAnd if we're lucky,\nit might even be important.\n\n00:00:55.118 --> 00:00:57.118\nSo, we wouldn't work\nif we didn't get paid,\n\n00:00:57.128 --> 00:00:59.998\nbut that's not why we do what we do.\n\n00:01:00.008 --> 00:01:01.048\nAnd in general,\n\n00:01:01.058 --> 00:01:04.118\nI think we think that material rewards\nare a pretty bad reason\n\n00:01:04.128 --> 00:01:06.048\nfor doing the work that we do.\n\n00:01:06.058 --> 00:01:10.088\nWhen we say of somebody\nthat he's \"in it for the money,\"\n\n00:01:10.098 --> 00:01:12.968\nwe are not just being descriptive.\n\n00:01:12.978 --> 00:01:14.048\n(Laughter)\n\n00:01:14.058 --> 00:01:16.078\nNow, I think this is totally obvious,\n\n00:01:16.088 --> 00:01:19.068\nbut the very obviousness of it\nraises what is for me\n\n00:01:19.078 --> 00:01:21.178\nan incredibly profound question.\n\n00:01:21.188 --> 00:01:23.998\nWhy, if this is so obvious,\n\n00:01:24.008 --> 00:01:29.088\nwhy is it that for the overwhelming\nmajority of people on the planet,\n\n00:01:30.018 --> 00:01:33.968\nthe work they do\nhas none of the characteristics\n\n00:01:33.978 --> 00:01:38.158\nthat get us up and out of bed\nand off to the office every morning?\n\n00:01:38.168 --> 00:01:42.058\nHow is it that we allow\nthe majority of people on the planet\n\n00:01:42.068 --> 00:01:47.058\nto do work that is monotonous,\nmeaningless and soul-deadening?\n\n00:01:47.068 --> 00:01:50.028\nWhy is it that as capitalism developed,\n\n00:01:50.038 --> 00:01:53.078\nit created a mode of production,\nof goods and services,\n\n00:01:53.088 --> 00:01:59.048\nin which all the nonmaterial satisfactions\nthat might come from work were eliminated?\n\n00:02:00.048 --> 00:02:02.058\nWorkers who do this kind of work,\n\n00:02:02.068 --> 00:02:05.018\nwhether they do it in factories,\nin call centers,\n\n00:02:05.028 --> 00:02:07.138\nor in fulfillment warehouses,\n\n00:02:07.148 --> 00:02:09.138\ndo it for pay.\n\n00:02:09.148 --> 00:02:14.958\nThere is certainly no other earthly reason\nto do what they do except for pay.\n\n00:02:14.968 --> 00:02:17.028\nSo the question is, \"Why?\"\n\n00:02:17.958 --> 00:02:19.178\nAnd here's the answer:\n\n00:02:20.118 --> 00:02:23.058\nthe answer is technology.\n\n00:02:23.068 --> 00:02:24.148\nNow, I know, I know --\n\n00:02:24.158 --> 00:02:28.038\nyeah, yeah, yeah, technology, automation\nscrews people, blah blah --\n\n00:02:28.048 --> 00:02:29.158\nthat's not what I mean.\n\n00:02:29.168 --> 00:02:32.078\nI'm not talking about\nthe kind of technology\n\n00:02:32.088 --> 00:02:36.078\nthat has enveloped our lives,\nand that people come to TED to hear about.\n\n00:02:36.088 --> 00:02:39.068\nI'm not talking about\nthe technology of things,\n\n00:02:39.078 --> 00:02:41.058\nprofound though that is.\n\n00:02:41.068 --> 00:02:43.048\nI'm talking about another technology.\n\n00:02:43.058 --> 00:02:46.038\nI'm talking about the technology of ideas.\n\n00:02:47.008 --> 00:02:49.098\nI call it, \"idea technology\" --\n\n00:02:49.098 --> 00:02:50.168\nhow clever of me.\n\n00:02:50.178 --> 00:02:51.988\n(Laughter)\n\n00:02:51.988 --> 00:02:56.098\nIn addition to creating things,\nscience creates ideas.\n\n00:02:56.108 --> 00:02:59.078\nScience creates ways of understanding.\n\n00:02:59.088 --> 00:03:01.028\nAnd in the social sciences,\n\n00:03:01.038 --> 00:03:06.018\nthe ways of understanding that get created\nare ways of understanding ourselves.\n\n00:03:06.028 --> 00:03:10.088\nAnd they have an enormous influence\non how we think, what we aspire to,\n\n00:03:10.098 --> 00:03:11.988\nand how we act.\n\n00:03:11.998 --> 00:03:15.158\nIf you think your poverty\nis God's will, you pray.\n\n00:03:16.008 --> 00:03:20.118\nIf you think your poverty is the result\nof your own inadequacy,\n\n00:03:20.128 --> 00:03:23.068\nyou shrink into despair.\n\n00:03:23.078 --> 00:03:27.168\nAnd if you think your poverty is\nthe result of oppression and domination,\n\n00:03:27.178 --> 00:03:29.178\nthen you rise up in revolt.\n\n00:03:29.188 --> 00:03:33.978\nWhether your response to poverty\nis resignation or revolution,\n\n00:03:33.988 --> 00:03:37.158\ndepends on how you understand\nthe sources of your poverty.\n\n00:03:37.168 --> 00:03:43.058\nThis is the role that ideas play\nin shaping us as human beings,\n\n00:03:43.068 --> 00:03:48.998\nand this is why idea technology may be\nthe most profoundly important technology\n\n00:03:49.008 --> 00:03:50.518\nthat science gives us.\n\n00:03:51.058 --> 00:03:54.978\nAnd there's something special\nabout idea technology,\n\n00:03:55.078 --> 00:03:57.988\nthat makes it different\nfrom the technology of things.\n\n00:03:57.998 --> 00:04:01.138\nWith things, if the technology sucks,\n\n00:04:01.148 --> 00:04:03.188\nit just vanishes, right?\n\n00:04:03.958 --> 00:04:06.068\nBad technology disappears.\n\n00:04:06.078 --> 00:04:07.968\nWith ideas --\n\n00:04:07.978 --> 00:04:13.008\nfalse ideas about human beings\nwill not go away\n\n00:04:13.018 --> 00:04:15.438\nif people believe that they're true.\n\n00:04:16.188 --> 00:04:19.058\nBecause if people believe\nthat they're true,\n\n00:04:19.068 --> 00:04:22.108\nthey create ways of living\nand institutions\n\n00:04:22.118 --> 00:04:25.968\nthat are consistent\nwith these very false ideas.\n\n00:04:25.978 --> 00:04:29.998\nAnd that's how the industrial revolution\ncreated a factory system\n\n00:04:30.008 --> 00:04:34.148\nin which there was really nothing you\ncould possibly get out of your day's work,\n\n00:04:34.158 --> 00:04:37.028\nexcept for the pay at the end of the day.\n\n00:04:37.038 --> 00:04:39.028\nBecause the father --\none of the fathers\n\n00:04:39.028 --> 00:04:41.078\nof the Industrial Revolution,\nAdam Smith --\n\n00:04:41.088 --> 00:04:45.058\nwas convinced that human beings\nwere by their very natures lazy,\n\n00:04:45.068 --> 00:04:48.068\nand wouldn't do anything\nunless you made it worth their while,\n\n00:04:48.078 --> 00:04:50.068\nand the way you made it worth their while\n\n00:04:50.078 --> 00:04:53.068\nwas by incentivizing,\nby giving them rewards.\n\n00:04:53.078 --> 00:04:56.018\nThat was the only reason\nanyone ever did anything.\n\n00:04:56.028 --> 00:05:01.168\nSo we created a factory system consistent\nwith that false view of human nature.\n\n00:05:01.178 --> 00:05:04.138\nBut once that system\nof production was in place,\n\n00:05:04.148 --> 00:05:07.138\nthere was really no other way\nfor people to operate,\n\n00:05:07.148 --> 00:05:11.988\nexcept in a way that was consistent\nwith Adam Smith's vision.\n\n00:05:12.108 --> 00:05:15.108\nSo the work example is merely an example\n\n00:05:15.118 --> 00:05:19.168\nof how false ideas\ncan create a circumstance\n\n00:05:19.178 --> 00:05:22.028\nthat ends up making them true.\n\n00:05:23.098 --> 00:05:25.078\nIt is not true\n\n00:05:25.118 --> 00:05:28.148\nthat you \"just can't get\ngood help anymore.\"\n\n00:05:29.168 --> 00:05:30.998\nIt is true\n\n00:05:31.078 --> 00:05:33.988\nthat you \"can't get good help anymore\"\n\n00:05:33.998 --> 00:05:38.978\nwhen you give people work to do\nthat is demeaning and soulless.\n\n00:05:38.988 --> 00:05:41.048\nAnd interestingly enough, Adam Smith --\n\n00:05:41.058 --> 00:05:45.018\nthe same guy who gave us\nthis incredible invention\n\n00:05:45.028 --> 00:05:47.128\nof mass production, and division of labor\n\n00:05:47.138 --> 00:05:48.178\n-- understood this.\n\n00:05:48.188 --> 00:05:52.128\nHe said, of people who worked\nin assembly lines,\n\n00:05:52.138 --> 00:05:54.158\nof men who worked\nin assembly lines, he says:\n\n00:05:54.168 --> 00:06:00.978\n\"He generally becomes as stupid as it is\npossible for a human being to become.\"\n\n00:06:01.128 --> 00:06:03.148\nNow, notice the word here is \"become.\"\n\n00:06:03.158 --> 00:06:09.178\n\"He generally becomes as stupid as it is\npossible for a human being to become.\"\n\n00:06:09.188 --> 00:06:13.078\nWhether he intended it or not,\nwhat Adam Smith was telling us there,\n\n00:06:13.088 --> 00:06:16.988\nis that the very shape of the institution\nwithin which people work\n\n00:06:16.998 --> 00:06:21.088\ncreates people who are fitted\nto the demands of that institution\n\n00:06:21.098 --> 00:06:23.988\nand deprives people of the opportunity\n\n00:06:23.998 --> 00:06:28.468\nto derive the kinds of satisfactions\nfrom their work that we take for granted.\n\n00:06:29.058 --> 00:06:32.048\nThe thing about science --\nnatural

"duration": "1147", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/bj_miller_what_really_matters_at_the_end_of_life", "transcript": "Well, we all need a reason to wake up. For me, it just took 11,000 volts.I know you're too polite to ask, so I will tell you.One night, sophomore year of college, just back from Thanksgiving holiday, a few of my friends and I were horsing around, and we decided to climb atop a parked commuter train. It was just sitting there, with the wires that run overhead. Somehow, that seemed like a great idea at the time. We'd certainly done stupider things. I scurried up the ladder on the back, and when I stood up, the electrical current entered my arm, blew down and out my feet, and that was that. Would you believe that watch still works? Takes a licking!(Laughter)My father wears it now in solidarity.That night began my formal relationship with death \u2014 my death \u2014 and it also began my long run as a patient. It's a good word. It means one who suffers. So I guess we're all patients.Now, the American health care system has more than its fair share of dysfunction \u2014 to match its brilliance, to be sure. I'm a physician now, a hospice and palliative medicine doc, so I've seen care from both sides. And believe me: almost everyone who goes into healthcare really means well \u2014 I mean, truly. But we who work in it are also unwitting agents for a system that too often does not serve.Why? Well, there's actually a pretty easy answer to that question, and it explains a lot: because healthcare was designed with diseases, not people, at its center. Which is to say, of course, it was badly designed. And nowhere are the effects of bad design more heartbreaking or the opportunity for good design more compelling than at the end of life, where things are so distilled and concentrated. There are no do-overs.My purpose today is to reach out across disciplines and invite design thinking into this big conversation. That is, to bring intention and creativity to the experience of dying. We have a monumental opportunity in front of us, before one of the few universal issues as individuals as well as a civil society: to rethink and redesign how it is we die.So let's begin at the end. For most people, the scariest thing about death isn't being dead, it's dying, suffering. It's a key distinction. To get underneath this, it can be very helpful to tease out suffering which is necessary as it is, from suffering we can change. The former is a natural, essential part of life, part of the deal, and to this we are called to make space, adjust, grow. It can be really good to realize forces larger than ourselves. They bring proportionality, like a cosmic right-sizing. After my limbs were gone, that loss, for example, became fact, fixed \u2014 necessarily part of my life, and I learned that I could no more reject this fact than reject myself. It took me a while, but I learned it eventually. Now, another great thing about necessary suffering is that it is the very thing that unites caregiver and care receiver \u2014 human beings. This, we are finally realizing, is where healing happens. Yes, compassion \u2014 literally, as we learned yesterday \u2014 suffering together.Now, on the systems side, on the other hand, so much of the suffering is unnecessary, invented. It serves no good purpose. But the good news is, since this brand of suffering is made up, well, we can change it. How we die is indeed something we can affect. Making the system sensitive to this fundamental distinction between necessary and unnecessary suffering gives us our first of three design cues for the day. After all, our role as caregivers, as people who care, is to relieve suffering \u2014 not add to the pile.True to the tenets of palliative care, I function as something of a reflective advocate, as much as prescribing physician. Quick aside: palliative care \u2014 a very important field but poorly understood \u2014 while it includes, it is not limited to end of life care. It is not limited to hospice. It's simply about comfort and living well at any stage. So please know that you don't have to be dying anytime soon to benefit from palliative care.Now, let me introduce you to Frank. Sort of makes this point. I've been seeing Frank now for years. He's living with advancing prostate cancer on top of long-standing HIV. We work on his bone pain and his fatigue, but most of the time we spend thinking out loud together about his life \u2014 really, about our lives. In this way, Frank grieves. In this way, he keeps up with his losses as they roll in, so that he's ready to take in the next moment. Loss is one thing, but regret, quite another. Frank has always been an adventurer \u2014 he looks like something out of a Norman Rockwell painting \u2014 and no fan of regret. So it wasn't surprising when he came into clinic one day, saying he wanted to raft down the Colorado River. Was this a good idea? With all the risks to his safety and his health, some would say no. Many did, but he went for it, while he still could. It was a glorious, marvelous trip: freezing water, blistering dry heat, scorpions, snakes, wildlife howling off the flaming walls of the Grand Canyon \u2014 all the glorious side of the world beyond our control. Frank's decision, while maybe dramatic, is exactly the kind so many of us would make, if we only had the support to figure out what is best for ourselves over time.So much of what we're talking about today is a shift in perspective. After my accident, when I went back to college, I changed my major to art history. Studying visual art, I figured I'd learn something about how to see \u2014 a really potent lesson for a kid who couldn't change so much of what he was seeing. Perspective, that kind of alchemy we humans get to play with, turning anguish into a flower.Flash forward: now I work at an amazing place in San Francisco called the Zen Hospice Project, where we have a little ritual that helps with this shift in perspective. When one of our residents dies, the mortuary men come, and as we're wheeling the body out through the garden, heading for the gate, we pause. Anyone who wants \u2014 fellow residents, family, nurses, volunteers, the hearse drivers too, now \u2014 shares a story or a song or silence, as we sprinkle the body with flower petals. It takes a few minutes; it's a sweet, simple parting image to usher in grief with warmth, rather than repugnance. Contrast that with the typical experience in the hospital setting, much like this \u2014 floodlit room lined with tubes and beeping machines and blinking lights that don't stop even when the patient's life has. Cleaning crew swoops in, the body's whisked away, and it all feels as though that person had never really existed. Well-intended, of course, in the name of sterility, but hospitals tend to assault our senses, and the most we might hope for within those walls is numbness \u2014 anesthetic, literally the opposite of aesthetic. I revere hospitals for what they can do; I am alive because of them. But we ask too much of our hospitals. They are places for acute trauma and treatable illness. They are no place to live and die; that's not what they were designed for.Now mind you \u2014 I am not giving up on the notion that our institutions can become more humane. Beauty can be found anywhere. I spent a few months in a burn unit at St. Barnabas Hospital in Livingston, New Jersey, where I got really great care at every turn, including good palliative care for my pain. And one night, it began to snow outside. I remember my nurses complaining about driving through it. And there was no window in my room, but it was great to just imagine it coming down all sticky. Next day, one of my nurses smuggled in a snowball for me. She brought it in to the unit. I cannot tell you the rapture I felt holding that in my hand, and the coldness dripping onto my burning skin; the miracle of it all, the fascination as I watched it melt and turn into water. In that moment, just being any part of this planet in this universe mattered more to me than whether I lived or died. That little snowball packed all the inspiration I needed to both try to live and be OK if I did not. In a hospital, that's a stolen moment.In my work over the years, I've known many people who were ready to go, ready to die. Not because they had found some final peace or transcendence, but because they were so repulsed by what their lives had become \u2014 in a word, cut off, or ugly. There are already record numbers of us living with chronic and terminal illness, and into ever older age. And we are nowhere near ready or prepared for this silver tsunami. We need an infrastructure dynamic enough to handle these seismic shifts in our population. Now is the time to create something new, something vital. I know we can because we have to. The alternative is just unacceptable. And the key ingredients are known: policy, education and training, systems, bricks and mortar. We have tons of input for designers of all stripes to work with.We know, for example, from research what's most important to people who are closer to death: comfort; feeling unburdened and unburdening to those they love; existential peace; and a sense of wonderment and spirituality.Over Zen Hospice's nearly 30 years, we've learned much more from our residents in subtle detail. Little things aren't so little. Take Janette. She finds it harder to breathe one day to the next due to ALS. Well, guess what? She wants to start smoking again \u2014 and French cigarettes, if you please. Not out of some self-destructive bent, but to feel her lungs filled while she has them. Priorities change. Or Kate \u2014 she just wants to know her dog Austin is lying at the foot of her bed, his cold muzzle against her dry skin, instead of more chemotherapy coursing through her veins \u2014 she's done that. Sensuous, aesthetic gratification, where in a moment, in an instant, we are rewarded for just being. So much of it comes down to loving our time by way of the senses, by way of the body \u2014 the very thing doing the living and the dying.Probably the most poignant room in the Zen Hospice guest house is our kitchen, which is a little strange when you realize that so many of our residents can eat very little, if anything at all. But we realize we are providing sustenance on several levels: smell, a symbolic plane. Seriously, with all the heavy-duty stuff happening under our roof, one of the most tried and true interventions we know of, is to bake cookies. As long as we have our senses \u2014 even just one \u2014 we have at least the possibility of accessing what makes us feel human, connected. Imagine the ripples of this notion for the millions of people living and dying with dementia. Primal sensorial delights that say the things we don't have words for, impulses that make us stay present \u2014 no need for a past or a future.So, if teasing unnecessary suffering out of the system was our first design cue, then tending to dignity by way of the senses, by way of the body \u2014 the aesthetic realm \u2014 is design cue number two. Now this gets us quickly to the third and final bit for today; namely, we need to lift our sights, to set our sights on well-being, so that life and health and healthcare can become about making life more wonderful, rather than just less horrible. Beneficence.Here, this gets right at the distinction between a disease-centered and a patient- or human-centered model of care, and here is where caring becomes a creative, generative, even playful act. \"Play\" may sound like a funny word here. But it is also one of our highest forms of adaptation. Consider every major compulsory effort it takes to be human. The need for food has birthed cuisine. The need for shelter has given rise to architecture. The need for cover, fashion. And for being subjected to the clock, well, we invented music. So, since dying is a necessary part of life, what might we create with this fact? By \"play\" I am in no way suggesting we take a light approach to dying or that we mandate any particular way of dying. There are mountains of sorrow that cannot move, and one way or another, we will all kneel there. Rather, I am asking that we make space \u2014 physical, psychic room, to allow life to play itself all the way out \u2014 so that rather than just getting out of the way, aging and dying can become a process of crescendo through to the end. We can't solve for death. I know some of you are working on this.(Laughter)Meanwhile, we can \u2014(Laughter)We can design towards it. Parts of me died early on, and that's something we can all say one way or another. I got to redesign my life around this fact, and I tell you it has been a liberation to realize you can always find a shock of beauty or meaning in what life you have left, like that snowball lasting for a perfect moment, all the while melting away. If we love such moments ferociously, then maybe we can learn to live well \u2014 not in spite of death, but because of it. Let death be what takes us, not lack of imagination.Thank you.(Applause)", "id": 2325, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:13.957 --> 00:00:16.966\nWell, we all need a reason to wake up.\n\n00:00:18.856 --> 00:00:21.229\nFor me, it just took 11,000 volts.\n\n00:00:23.026 --> 00:00:24.700\nI know you're too polite to ask,\n\n00:00:24.724 --> 00:00:26.359\nso I will tell you.\n\n00:00:27.312 --> 00:00:29.535\nOne night, sophomore year of college,\n\n00:00:29.559 --> 00:00:33.257\njust back from Thanksgiving holiday,\n\n00:00:33.281 --> 00:00:35.933\na few of my friends and I\nwere horsing around,\n\n00:00:35.957 --> 00:00:39.522\nand we decided to climb atop\na parked commuter train.\n\n00:00:40.125 --> 00:00:43.239\nIt was just sitting there,\nwith the wires that run overhead.\n\n00:00:43.263 --> 00:00:46.365\nSomehow, that seemed\nlike a great idea at the time.\n\n00:00:46.762 --> 00:00:49.244\nWe'd certainly done stupider things.\n\n00:00:50.228 --> 00:00:53.249\nI scurried up the ladder on the back,\n\n00:00:53.273 --> 00:00:54.995\nand when I stood up,\n\n00:00:55.019 --> 00:00:58.601\nthe electrical current entered my arm,\n\n00:00:58.625 --> 00:01:01.165\nblew down and out my feet,\nand that was that.\n\n00:01:03.657 --> 00:01:06.246\nWould you believe that watch still works?\n\n00:01:08.174 --> 00:01:09.381\nTakes a licking!\n\n00:01:09.405 --> 00:01:10.436\n(Laughter)\n\n00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:12.769\nMy father wears it now in solidarity.\n\n00:01:15.253 --> 00:01:21.276\nThat night began my formal relationship\nwith death -- my death --\n\n00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:25.108\nand it also began\nmy long run as a patient.\n\n00:01:25.132 --> 00:01:26.286\nIt's a good word.\n\n00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:28.037\nIt means one who suffers.\n\n00:01:28.783 --> 00:01:30.224\nSo I guess we're all patients.\n\n00:01:31.565 --> 00:01:33.931\nNow, the American health care system\n\n00:01:33.955 --> 00:01:37.076\nhas more than its fair share\nof dysfunction --\n\n00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:39.160\nto match its brilliance, to be sure.\n\n00:01:39.708 --> 00:01:44.160\nI'm a physician now,\na hospice and palliative medicine doc,\n\n00:01:44.184 --> 00:01:46.430\nso I've seen care from both sides.\n\n00:01:47.034 --> 00:01:50.933\nAnd believe me: almost everyone\nwho goes into healthcare\n\n00:01:50.957 --> 00:01:54.094\nreally means well -- I mean, truly.\n\n00:01:54.832 --> 00:01:58.765\nBut we who work in it\nare also unwitting agents\n\n00:01:58.789 --> 00:02:03.033\nfor a system that too often\ndoes not serve.\n\n00:02:03.957 --> 00:02:05.114\nWhy?\n\n00:02:05.582 --> 00:02:08.963\nWell, there's actually a pretty easy\nanswer to that question,\n\n00:02:08.987 --> 00:02:11.235\nand it explains a lot:\n\n00:02:11.259 --> 00:02:17.217\nbecause healthcare was designed\nwith diseases, not people, at its center.\n\n00:02:18.377 --> 00:02:21.283\nWhich is to say, of course,\nit was badly designed.\n\n00:02:22.116 --> 00:02:28.168\nAnd nowhere are the effects\nof bad design more heartbreaking\n\n00:02:28.192 --> 00:02:31.527\nor the opportunity\nfor good design more compelling\n\n00:02:31.551 --> 00:02:33.692\nthan at the end of life,\n\n00:02:33.716 --> 00:02:37.072\nwhere things are so distilled\nand concentrated.\n\n00:02:38.192 --> 00:02:39.978\nThere are no do-overs.\n\n00:02:42.031 --> 00:02:46.522\nMy purpose today is\nto reach out across disciplines\n\n00:02:46.546 --> 00:02:50.913\nand invite design thinking\ninto this big conversation.\n\n00:02:51.453 --> 00:02:56.810\nThat is, to bring intention and creativity\n\n00:02:56.834 --> 00:02:59.603\nto the experience of dying.\n\n00:03:01.193 --> 00:03:05.226\nWe have a monumental\nopportunity in front of us,\n\n00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:09.591\nbefore one of the few universal issues\n\n00:03:09.615 --> 00:03:12.925\nas individuals as well as a civil society:\n\n00:03:12.949 --> 00:03:16.865\nto rethink and redesign how it is we die.\n\n00:03:19.447 --> 00:03:22.037\nSo let's begin at the end.\n\n00:03:23.569 --> 00:03:27.504\nFor most people, the scariest thing\nabout death isn't being dead,\n\n00:03:27.528 --> 00:03:29.347\nit's dying, suffering.\n\n00:03:29.767 --> 00:03:31.142\nIt's a key distinction.\n\n00:03:32.419 --> 00:03:34.587\nTo get underneath this,\nit can be very helpful\n\n00:03:34.611 --> 00:03:38.965\nto tease out suffering\nwhich is necessary as it is,\n\n00:03:38.989 --> 00:03:41.654\nfrom suffering we can change.\n\n00:03:42.275 --> 00:03:47.511\nThe former is a natural,\nessential part of life, part of the deal,\n\n00:03:47.535 --> 00:03:52.649\nand to this we are called\nto make space, adjust, grow.\n\n00:03:54.971 --> 00:04:00.317\nIt can be really good\nto realize forces larger than ourselves.\n\n00:04:01.056 --> 00:04:04.180\nThey bring proportionality,\n\n00:04:04.204 --> 00:04:06.523\nlike a cosmic right-sizing.\n\n00:04:08.737 --> 00:04:11.171\nAfter my limbs were gone,\n\n00:04:11.195 --> 00:04:15.781\nthat loss, for example,\nbecame fact, fixed --\n\n00:04:15.805 --> 00:04:19.118\nnecessarily part of my life,\n\n00:04:19.142 --> 00:04:25.258\nand I learned that I could no more\nreject this fact than reject myself.\n\n00:04:27.131 --> 00:04:29.752\nIt took me a while,\nbut I learned it eventually.\n\n00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:32.974\nNow, another great thing\nabout necessary suffering\n\n00:04:32.998 --> 00:04:36.506\nis that it is the very thing\n\n00:04:36.530 --> 00:04:41.933\nthat unites caregiver and care receiver --\n\n00:04:41.957 --> 00:04:43.210\nhuman beings.\n\n00:04:45.047 --> 00:04:48.861\nThis, we are finally realizing,\nis where healing happens.\n\n00:04:49.631 --> 00:04:53.151\nYes, compassion -- literally,\nas we learned yesterday --\n\n00:04:53.175 --> 00:04:54.603\nsuffering together.\n\n00:04:56.630 --> 00:04:59.968\nNow, on the systems side,\non the other hand,\n\n00:04:59.992 --> 00:05:03.850\nso much of the suffering\nis unnecessary, invented.\n\n00:05:04.334 --> 00:05:06.608\nIt serves no good purpose.\n\n00:05:06.632 --> 00:05:10.933\nBut the good news is,\nsince this brand of suffering is made up,\n\n00:05:10.957 --> 00:05:12.441\nwell, we can change it.\n\n00:05:13.639 --> 00:05:16.293\nHow we die is indeed\nsomething we can affect.\n\n00:05:18.404 --> 00:05:22.457\nMaking the system sensitive\nto this fundamental distinction\n\n00:05:22.481 --> 00:05:25.933\nbetween necessary\nand unnecessary suffering\n\n00:05:25.957 --> 00:05:29.647\ngives us our first of three\ndesign cues for the day.\n\n00:05:30.257 --> 00:05:34.786\nAfter all, our role as caregivers,\nas people who care,\n\n00:05:34.810 --> 00:05:39.472\nis to relieve suffering --\nnot add to the pile.\n\n00:05:42.250 --> 00:05:44.121\nTrue to the tenets of palliative care,\n\n00:05:44.145 --> 00:05:47.818\nI function as something\nof a reflective advocate,\n\n00:05:47.842 --> 00:05:49.961\nas much as prescribing physician.\n\n00:05:51.135 --> 00:05:57.156\nQuick aside: palliative care -- a very\nimportant field but poorly understood --\n\n00:05:57.180 --> 00:06:00.134\nwhile it includes, it is not\nlimited to end of life care.\n\n00:06:00.158 --> 00:06:01.999\nIt is not limited to hospice.\n\n00:06:02.769 --> 00:06:06.226\nIt's simply about comfort\nand living well at any stage.\n\n00:06:06.957 --> 00:06:09.996\nSo please know that you don't\nhave to be dying anytime soon\n\n00:06:10.020 --> 00:06:11.707\nto benefit from palliative care.\n\n00:06:13.408 --> 00:06:15.688\nNow, let me introduce you to Frank.\n\n00:06:17.726 --> 00:06:18.941\nSort of makes this point.\n\n00:06:18.965 --> 00:06:20.995\nI've been seeing Frank now for years.\n\n00:06:21.019 --> 00:06:25.213\nHe's living with advancing prostate cancer\non top of long-standing HIV.\n\n00:06:26.155 --> 00:06:28.141\nWe work on his bone pain and his fatigue,\n\n00:06:28.165 --> 00:06:32.879\nbut most of the time we spend thinking\nout loud together about his life --\n\n00:06:32.903 --> 00:06:34.268\nreally, about our lives.\n\n00:06:35.029 --> 00:06:36.689\nIn this way, Frank grieves.\n\n00:06:37.165 --> 00:06:40.944\nIn this way, he keeps up with\nhis losses as they roll in,\n\n00:06:40.968 --> 00:06:44.117\nso that he's ready to take in\nthe next moment.\n\n00:06:45.482 --> 00:06:49.653\nLoss is one thing,\nbut regret, quite another.\n\n00:06:51.201 --> 00:06:53.158\nFrank has always been an adventurer --\n\n00:06:53.182 --> 00:06:56.023\nhe looks like something\nout of a Norman Rockwell painting --\n\n00:06:56.047 --> 00:06:57.611\nand no fan of regret.\n\n00:06:58.524 --> 00:07:01.205\nSo it wasn't surprising\nwhen he came into clinic one day,\n\n00:07:01.229 --> 00:07:03.965\nsaying he wanted to raft\ndown the Colorado River.\n\n00:07:05.100 --> 00:07:06.775\nWas this a good idea?\n\n00:07:07.226 --> 00:07:11.430\nWith all the risks to his safety\nand his health, some would say no.\n\n00:07:11.454 --> 00:07:15.020\nMany did, but he went for it,\nwhile he still could.\n\n00:07:15.957 --> 00:07:19.568\nIt was a glorious, marvelous trip:\n\n00:07:20.886 --> 00:07:26.208\nfreezing water, blistering dry heat,\nscorpions, snakes,\n\n00:07:26.232 --> 00:07:31.663\nwildlife howling off the flaming walls\nof the Grand Canyon --\n\n00:07:31.687 --> 00:07:35.231\nall the glorious side of the world\nbeyond our control.\n\n00:07:36.450 --> 00:07:38.340\nFrank's decision, while maybe dramatic,\n\n00:07:38.364 --> 00:07:40.651\nis exactly the kind\nso many of us would make,\n\n00:07:40.675 --> 00:07:46.872\nif we only had the support to figure out\nwhat is best for ourselves over time.\n\n00:07:49.249 --> 00:07:52.618\nSo much of what we're talking about today\nis a shift in perspective.\n\n00:07:54.681 --> 00:07:56.933\nAfter my accident,\nwhen I went back to college,\n\n00:07:56.957 --> 00:07:59.323\nI changed my major to art history.\n\n00:08:00.053 --> 00:08:04.353\nStudying visual art, I figured\nI'd learn something about how to see --\n\n00:08:05.663 --> 00:08:09.037\na really potent lesson\nfor a kid who couldn't change\n\n00:08:09.061 --> 00:08:11.102\nso much of what he was seeing.\n\n00:08:12.560 --> 00:08:16.298\nPerspective, that kind of alchemy\nwe humans get to play with,\n\n00:08:16.322 --> 00:08:18.832\nturning anguish into a flower.\n\n00:08:21.957 --> 00:08:25.749\nFlash forward: now I work\nat an amazing place in San Francisco\n\n00:08:25.773 --> 00:08:28.012\ncalled the Zen Hospice Project,\n\n00:08:28.036 --> 00:08:31.656\nwhere we have a little ritual\nthat helps with this shift in perspective.\n\n00:08:32.363 --> 00:08:35.424\nWhen one of our residents dies,\n\n00:08:35.448 --> 00:08:39.918\nthe mortuary men come, and as we're\nwheeling the body out through the garden,\n\n00:08:39.942 --> 00:08:41.972\nheading for the gate, we pause.\n\n00:08:41.996 --> 00:08:44.181\nAnyone who wants --\n\n00:08:44.205 --> 00:08:46.929\nfellow residents, family,\nnurses, volunteers,\n\n00:08:46.953 --> 00:08:49.397\nthe hearse drivers too, now --\n\n00:08:49.421 --> 00:08:53.848\nshares a story or a song or silence,\n\n00:08:53.872 --> 00:08:56.660\nas we sprinkle the body\nwith flower petals.\n\n00:08:57.240 --> 00:08:59.544\nIt takes a few minutes;\n\n00:08:59.568 --> 00:09:04.933\nit's a sweet, simple parting image\nto usher in grief with warmth,\n\n00:09:04.957 --> 00:09:06.668\nrather than repugnance.\n\n00:09:08.018 --> 00:09:13.064\nContrast that with the typical experience\nin the hospital setting,\n\n00:09:13.088 --> 00:09:17.952\nmuch like this -- floodlit room\nlined with tubes and beeping machines\n\n00:09:17.976 --> 00:09:22.144\nand blinking lights that don't stop\neven when the patient's life has.\n\n00:09:23.377 --> 00:09:26.403\nCleaning crew swoops in,\nthe body's whisked away,\n\n00:09:26.427 --> 00:09:31.455\nand it all feels as though that person\nhad never really existed.\n\n00:09:33.028 --> 00:09:35.651\nWell-intended, of course,\nin the name of sterility,\n\n00:09:35.675 --> 00:09:39.171\nbut hospitals tend to assault our senses,\n\n00:09:39.195 --> 00:09:44.699\nand the most we might hope for\nwithin those walls is numbness --\n\n00:09:44.723 --> 00:09:48.965\nanesthetic, literally\nthe opposite of aesthetic.\n\n00:09:50.457 --> 00:09:54.762\nI revere hospitals for what they can do;\nI am alive because of them.\n\n00:09:56.054 --> 00:09:58.171\nBut we ask too much of our hospitals.\n\n00:09:59.394 --> 00:10:02.987\nThey are places for acute trauma\nand treatable illness.\n\n00:10:03.011 --> 00:10:07.036\nThey are no place to live and die;\nthat's not what they were designed for.\n\n00:10:10.036 --> 00:10:12.336\nNow mind you -- I am not\ngiving up on the notion\n\n00:10:12.360 --> 00:10:15.570\nthat our institutions\ncan become more humane.\n\n00:10:16.015 --> 00:10:18.396\nBeauty can be found anywhere.\n\n00:10:21.050 --> 00:10:23.322\nI spent a few months in a burn unit\n\n00:10:23.346 --> 00:10:26.094\nat St. Barnabas Hospital\nin Livingston, New Jersey,\n\n00:10:26.118 --> 00:10:30.275\nwhere I got really\ngreat care at every turn,\n\n00:10:30.299 --> 00:10:32.496\nincluding good\npalliative care for my pain.\n\n00:10:33.373 --> 00:10:36.218\nAnd one night, it began to snow outside.\n\n00:10:37.384 --> 00:10:41.299\nI remember my nurses\ncomplaining about driving through it.\n\n00:10:42.061 --> 00:10:44.245\nAnd there was no window in my room,\n\n00:10:44.269 --> 00:10:47.575\nbut it was great to just imagine it\ncoming down all sticky.\n\n00:10:49.257 --> 00:10:53.191\nNext day, one of my nurses\nsmuggled in a snowball for me.\n\n00:10:53.215 --> 00:10:54.848\nShe brought it in to the unit.\n\n00:10:56.689 --> 00:11:02.097\nI cannot tell you the rapture I felt\nholding that in my hand,\n\n00:11:02.121 --> 00:11:05.170\nand the coldness dripping\nonto my burning skin;\n\n00:11:05.194 --> 00:11:07.504\nthe miracle of it all,\n\n00:11:07.528 --> 00:11:11.287\nthe fascination as I watched it melt\nand turn into water.\n\n00:11:15.251 --> 00:11:17.382\nIn that moment,\n\n00:11:17.406 --> 00:11:21.894\njust being any part of this planet\nin this universe mattered more to me\n\n00:11:21.918 --> 00:11:24.017\nthan whether I lived or died.\n\n00:11:24.041 --> 00:11:27.164\nThat little snowball packed\nall the inspiration I needed\n\n00:11:27.188 --> 00:11:30.393\nto both try to live\nand be OK if I did not.\n\n00:11:31.134 --> 00:11:34.018\nIn a hospital, that's a stolen moment.\n\n00:11:36.314 --> 00:11:39.703\nIn my work over the years,\nI've known many people\n\n00:11:39.727 --> 00:11:41.554\nwho were ready to go, ready to die.\n\n00:11:43.150 --> 00:11:47.933\nNot because they had found\nsome final peace or transcendence,\n\n00:11:47.957 --> 00:11:52.266\nbut because they were so repulsed\nby what their lives had become --\n\n00:11:54.511 --> 00:11:59.060\nin a word, cut off, or ugly.\n\n00:12:03.352 --> 00:12:09.438\nThere are already record numbers of us\nliving with chronic and terminal illness,\n\n00:12:09.462 --> 00:12:10.914\nand into ever older age.\n\n00:12:11.905 --> 00:12:16.705\nAnd we are nowhere near ready\nor prepared for this silver tsunami.\n\n00:12:19.293 --> 00:12:22.554\nWe need an infrastructure\ndynamic enough to handle\n\n00:12:22.578 --> 00:12:26.642\nthese seismic shifts in our population.\n\n00:12:27.595 --> 00:12:30.615\nNow is the time to create\nsomething new, something vital.\n\n00:12:30.639 --> 00:12:32.999\nI know we can because we have to.\n\n00:12:33.023 --> 00:12:35.045\nThe alternative is just unacceptable.\n\n00:12:35.609 --> 00:12:37.491\nAnd the key ingredients are known:\n\n00:12:37.515 --> 00:12:41.189\npolicy, education and training,\n\n00:12:41.213 --> 00:12:43.275\nsystems, bricks and mortar.\n\n00:12:44.600 --> 00:12:48.406\nWe have tons of input\nfor designers of all stripes to work with.\n\n00:12:49.081 --> 00:12:50.962\nWe know, for example, from research\n\n00:12:50.986 --> 00:12:54.472\nwhat's most important to people\nwho are closer to death:\n\n00:12:54.496 --> 00:13:01.461\ncomfort; feeling unburdened\nand unburdening to those they love;\n\n00:13:01.485 --> 00:13:06.727\nexistential peace; and a sense\nof wonderment and spirituality.\n\n00:13:08.854 --> 00:13:12.612\nOver Zen Hospice's nearly 30 years,\n\n00:13:12.636 --> 00:13:16.279\nwe've learned much more\nfrom our residents in subtle detail.\n\n00:13:17.620 --> 00:13:20.085\nLittle things aren't so little.\n\n00:13:21.457 --> 00:13:22.631\nTake Janette.\n\n00:13:22.655 --> 00:13:26.142\nShe finds it harder to breathe\none day to the next due to ALS.\n\n00:13:26.166 --> 00:13:27.316\nWell, guess what?\n\n00:13:28.079 --> 00:13:31.457\nShe wants to start smoking again --\n\n00:13:31.481 --> 00:13:34.409\nand French cigarettes, if you please.\n\n00:13:36.744 --> 00:13:38.967\nNot out of some self-destructive bent,\n\n00:13:38.991 --> 00:13:42.950\nbut to feel her lungs filled\nwhile she has them.\n\n00:13:44.744 --> 00:13:45.941\nPriorities change.\n\n00:13:47.514 --> 00:13:49.985\nOr Kate -- she just wants to know\n\n00:13:50.009 --> 00:13:54.044\nher dog Austin is lying\nat the foot of her bed,\n\n00:13:54.068 --> 00:13:57.785\nhis cold muzzle against her dry skin,\n\n00:13:57.809 --> 00:14:00.532\ninstead of more chemotherapy\ncoursing through her veins --\n\n00:14:00.556 --> 00:14:01.737\nshe's done that.\n\n00:14:02.807 --> 00:14:07.823\nSensuous, aesthetic gratification,\nwhere in a moment, in an instant,\n\n00:14:07.847 --> 00:14:11.199\nwe are rewarded for just being.\n\n00:14:15.331 --> 00:14:19.613\nSo much of it comes down to\nloving our time by way of the senses,\n\n00:14:19.637 --> 00:14:24.929\nby way of the body -- the very thing\ndoing the living and the dying.\n\n00:14:26.216 --> 00:14:27.775\nProbably the most poignant room\n\n00:14:27.799 --> 00:14:30.052\nin the Zen Hospice guest house\nis our kitchen,\n\n00:14:30.076 --> 00:14:32.113\nwhich is a little strange when you realize\n\n00:14:32.137 --> 00:14:35.950\nthat so many of our residents\ncan eat very little, if anything at all.\n\n00:14:35.974 --> 00:14:41.844\nBut we realize we are providing\nsustenance on several levels:\n\n00:14:41.868 --> 00:14:44.934\nsmell, a symbolic plane.\n\n00:14:46.314 --> 00:14:51.231\nSeriously, with all the heavy-duty stuff\nhappening under our roof,\n\n00:14:51.255 --> 00:14:54.989\none of the most tried and true\ninterventions we know of,\n\n00:14:55.013 --> 00:14:58.506\nis to bake cookies.\n\n00:15:10.102 --> 00:15:11.706\nAs long as we have our senses --\n\n00:15:11.730 --> 00:15:13.742\neven just one --\n\n00:15:13.766 --> 00:15:17.175\nwe have at least\nthe possibility of accessing\n\n00:15:17.199 --> 00:15:20.367\nwhat makes us feel human, connected.\n\n00:15:22.957 --> 00:15:25.743\nImagine the ripples of this notion\n\n00:15:25.767 --> 00:15:28.552\nfor the millions of people\nliving and dying with dementia.\n\n00:15:29.512 --> 00:15:33.777\nPrimal sensorial delights that say\nthe things we don't have words for,\n\n00:15:33.801 --> 00:15:36.675\nimpulses that make us stay present --\n\n00:15:36.699 --> 00:15:39.504\nno need for a past or a future.\n\n00:15:42.238 --> 00:15:48.432\nSo, if teasing unnecessary suffering out\nof the system was our first design cue,\n\n00:15:50.517 --> 00:15:53.221\nthen tending to dignity\nby way of the senses,\n\n00:15:53.245 --> 00:15:57.037\nby way of the body --\nthe aesthetic realm --\n\n00:15:57.061 --> 00:15:58.918\nis design cue number two.\n\n00:15:59.902 --> 00:16:03.708\nNow this gets us quickly to the third\nand final bit for today;\n\n00:16:03.732 --> 00:16:10.596\nnamely, we need to lift our sights,\nto set our sights on well-being,\n\n00:16:10.620 --> 00:16:13.933\nso that life and health and healthcare\n\n00:16:13.957 --> 00:16:16.342\ncan become about making life\nmore wonderful,\n\n00:16:16.366 --> 00:16:18.810\nrather than just less horrible.\n\n00:16:20.154 --> 00:16:21.310\nBeneficence.\n\n00:16:22.957 --> 00:16:25.092\nHere, this gets right at the distinction\n\n00:16:25.116 --> 00:16:30.250\nbetween a disease-centered and a patient-\nor human-centered model of care,\n\n00:16:30.274 --> 00:16:33.735\nand here is where caring\nbecomes a creative, generative,\n\n00:16:33.759 --> 00:16:35.601\neven playful act.\n\n00:16:36.615 --> 00:16:38.615\n\"Play\" may sound like a funny word here.\n\n00:16:39.645 --> 00:16:42.549\nBut it is also one of our\nhighest forms of adaptation.\n\n00:16:42.573 --> 00:16:47.232\nConsider every major compulsory effort\nit takes to be human.\n\n00:16:47.256 --> 00:16:49.759\nThe need for food has birthed cuisine.\n\n00:16:49.783 --> 00:16:52.371\nThe need for shelter\nhas given rise to architecture.\n\n00:16:52.395 --> 00:16:54.601\nThe need for cover, fashion.\n\n00:16:54.625 --> 00:16:57.356\nAnd for being subjected to the clock,\n\n00:16:57.380 --> 00:17:00.907\nwell, we invented music.\n\n00:17:03.724 --> 00:17:06.933\nSo, since dying\nis a necessary part of life,\n\n00:17:06.957 --> 00:17:09.588\nwhat might we create with this fact?\n\n00:17:12.012 --> 00:17:15.388\nBy \"play\" I am in no way suggesting\nwe take a light approach to dying\n\n00:17:15.412 --> 00:17:18.051\nor that we mandate\nany particular way of dying.\n\n00:17:18.075 --> 00:17:20.933\nThere are mountains of sorrow\nthat cannot move,\n\n00:17:20.957 --> 00:17:24.024\nand one way or another,\nwe will all kneel there.\n\n00:17:24.957 --> 00:17:28.458\nRather, I am asking that we make space --\n\n00:17:28.482 --> 00:17:34.225\nphysical, psychic room, to allow life\nto play itself all the way out --\n\n00:17:34.249 --> 00:17:37.606\nso that rather than just\ngetting out of the way,\n\n00:17:37.630 --> 00:17:42.447\naging and dying can become\na process of crescendo through to the end.\n\n00:17:44.889 --> 00:17:48.730\nWe can't solve for death.\n\n00:17:50.241 --> 00:17:52.548\nI know some of you are working on this.\n\n00:17:52.572 --> 00:17:56.247\n(Laughter)\n\n00:17:56.961 --> 00:17:58.773\nMeanwhile, we can --\n\n00:17:58.797 --> 00:18:00.813\n(Laughter)\n\n00:18:00.837 --> 00:18:03.143\nWe can design towards it.\n\n00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:05.375\nParts of me died early on,\n\n00:18:05.399 --> 00:18:08.163\nand that's something we can all say\none way or another.\n\n00:18:08.541 --> 00:18:11.182\nI got to redesign my life\naround this fact,\n\n00:18:11.206 --> 00:18:14.546\nand I tell you it has been a liberation\n\n00:18:14.570 --> 00:18:17.725\nto realize you can always find\na shock of beauty or meaning\n\n00:18:17.749 --> 00:18:20.016\nin what life you have left,\n\n00:18:20.040 --> 00:18:22.804\nlike that snowball lasting\nfor a perfect moment,\n\n00:18:22.828 --> 00:18:25.126\nall the while melting away.\n\n00:18:26.658 --> 00:18:32.677\nIf we love such moments ferociously,\n\n00:18:32.701 --> 00:18:34.973\nthen maybe we can learn to live well --\n\n00:18:34.997 --> 00:18:37.084\nnot in spite of death,\n\n00:18:37.108 --> 00:18:38.694\nbut because of it.\n\n00:18:42.478 --> 00:18:44.654\nLet death be what takes us,\n\n00:18:44.678 --> 00:18:47.540\nnot lack of imagination.\n\n00:18:48.826 --> 00:18:49.978\nThank you.\n\n00:18:50.002 -->

"https://www.ted.com/talks/billie_jean_king_this_tennis_icon_paved_the_way_for_women_in_sports", "transcript": "Billie Jean King: Hi, everyone!(Applause)Thanks, Pat. Thank you! Getting me all wound up, now!(Laughter)Pat Mitchell: Good! You know, when I was watching the video again of the match, you must have felt like the fate of the world's women was on every stroke you took. Were you feeling that?BJK: First of all, Bobby Riggs \u2014 he was the former number one player, he wasn't just some hacker, by the way. He was one of my heroes and I admired him. And that's the reason I beat him, actually, because I respected him.(Laughter)It's true \u2014 my mom and especially my dad always said: \"Respect your opponent, and never underestimate them, ever.\" And he was correct. He was absolutely correct. But I knew it was about social change. And I was really nervous whenever we announced it, and I felt like the whole world was on my shoulders. And I thought, \"If I lose, it's going to put women back 50 years, at least.\" Title IX had just been passed the year before \u2014 June 23, 1972. And women's professional tennis \u2014 there were nine of us who signed a one-dollar contract in 1970 \u2014 now remember, the match is in '73. So we were only in our third year of having a tour where we could actually play, have a place to compete and make a living. So there were nine of us that signed that one-dollar contract. And our dream was for any girl, born any place in the world \u2014 if she was good enough \u2014 there would be a place for her to compete and for us to make a living. Because before 1968, we made 14 dollars a day, and we were under the control of organizations. So we really wanted to break away from that. But we knew it wasn't really about our generation so much; we knew it was about the future generations.We do stand on the shoulders of the people that came before us, there is no question. But every generation has the chance to make it better. That was really on my mind. I really wanted to start matching the hearts and minds to Title IX. Title IX, in case anybody doesn't know, which a lot of people probably don't, said that any federal funds given to a high school, college or university, either public or private, had to \u2014 finally \u2014 give equal monies to boys and girls. And that changed everything.(Applause)So you can have a law, but it's changing the hearts and minds to match up with it. That's when it really rocks, totally. So that was on my mind. I wanted to start that change in the hearts and minds.But two things came out of that match. For women: self-confidence, empowerment. They actually had enough nerve to ask for a raise. Some women have waited 10, 15 years to ask. I said, \"More importantly, did you get it?\"(Laughter)And they did! And for the men? A lot of the men today don't realize it, but if you're in your 50s, 60s or whatever, late 40s, you're the first generation of men of the Women's Movement \u2014 whether you like it or not!(Laughter)(Applause)And for the men, what happened for the men, they'd come up to me \u2014 and most times, the men are the ones who have tears in their eyes, it's very interesting. They go, \"Billie, I was very young when I saw that match, and now I have a daughter. And I am so happy I saw that as a young man.\" And one of those young men, at 12 years old, was President Obama. And he actually told me that when I met him, he said: \"You don't realize it, but I saw that match at 12. And now I have two daughters, and it has made a difference in how I raise them.\" So both men and women got a lot out of it, but different things.PM: And now there are generations \u2014 at least one or two \u2014 who have experienced the equality that Title IX and other fights along the way made possible. And for women, there are generations who have also experienced teamwork. They got to play team sports in a way they hadn't before. So you had a legacy already built in terms of being an athlete, a legacy of the work you did to lobby for equal pay for women athletes and the Women's Sports Foundation. What now are you looking to accomplish with The Billie Jean King Leadership Initiative?BJK: I think it goes back to an epiphany I had at 12. At 11, I wanted to be the number one tennis player in the world, and a friend had asked me to play and I said, \"What's that?\" Tennis was not in my family \u2014 basketball was, other sports. Fast forward to 12 years old,(Laughter)and I'm finally starting to play in tournaments where you get a ranking at the end of the year. So I was daydreaming at the Los Angeles Tennis Club, and I started thinking about my sport and how tiny it was, but also that everybody who played wore white shoes, white clothes, played with white balls \u2014 everybody who played was white. And I said to myself, at 12 years old, \"Where is everyone else?\" And that just kept sticking in my brain. And that moment, I promised myself I'd fight for equal rights and opportunities for boys and girls, men and women, the rest of my life. And that tennis, if I was fortunate enough to become number one \u2014 and I knew, being a girl, it would be harder to have influence, already at that age \u2014 that I had this platform. And tennis is global. And I thought, \"You know what? I've been given an opportunity that very few people have had.\" I didn't know if I was going to make it \u2014 this was only 12. I sure wanted it, but making it is a whole other discussion. I just remember I promised myself, and I really try to keep my word. That's who I truly am, just fighting for people.And, unfortunately, women have had less. And we are considered less. And so my attentions, where did they have to go? It was just ... you have to. And learn to stick up for yourself, hear your own voice. You hear the same words keep coming out all the time, and I got really lucky because I had an education. And I think if you can see it you can be it, you know? If you can see it, you can be it. You look at Pat, you look at other leaders, you look at these speakers, look at yourself, because everyone \u2014 everyone \u2014 can do something extraordinary. Every single person.PM: And your story, Billie, has inspired so many women everywhere. Now with the Billie Jean King Leadership Initiative, you're taking on an even bigger cause. Because one thing we hear a lot about is women taking their voice, working to find their way into leadership positions. But what you're talking about is even bigger than that. It's inclusive leadership. And this is a generation that has grown up thinking more inclusively \u2014BJK: Isn't it great? Look at the technology! It's amazing how it connects us all! It's about connection. It's simply amazing what's possible because of it. But the Billie Jean King Leadership Initiative is really about the workforce mostly, and trying to change it, so people can actually go to work and be their authentic selves.Because most of us have two jobs: One, to fit in \u2014 I'll give you a perfect example. An African American woman gets up an hour earlier to go to work, straightens her hair in the bathroom, goes to the bathroom probably four, five, six times a day to keep straightening her hair, to keep making sure she fits in. So she's working two jobs. She's got this other job, whatever that may be, but she's also trying to fit in. Or this poor man who kept his diploma \u2014 he went to University of Michigan, but he never would talk about his poverty as a youngster, ever \u2014 just would not mention it. So he made sure they saw he was well-educated. And then you see a gay guy who has an NFL \u2014 which means American football for all of you out there, it's a big deal, it's very macho \u2014 and he talked about football all the time, because he was gay and he didn't want anybody to know. It just goes on and on. So my wish for everyone is to be able to be their authentic self 24/7, that would be the ultimate. And we catch ourselves \u2014 I mean, I catch myself to this day. Even being gay I catch myself, you know, like,(Gasp)a little uncomfortable, a little surge in my gut, feeling not totally comfortable in my own skin. So, I think you have to ask yourself \u2014 I want people to be themselves, whatever that is, just let it be.PM: And the first research the Leadership Initiative did showed that, that these examples you just used \u2014 that many of us have the problem of being authentic. But what you've just looked at is this millennial generation, who have benefited from all these equal opportunities \u2014 which may not be equal but exist everywhere \u2014BJK: First of all, I'm really lucky. Partnership with Teneo, a strategic company that's amazing. That's really the reason I'm able to do this. I've had two times in my life where I've actually had men really behind me with power. And that was in the old days with Philip Morris with Virginia Slims, and this is the second time in my entire life. And then Deloitte. The one thing I wanted was data \u2014 facts. So Deloitte sent out a survey, and over 4,000 people now have answered, and we're continuing in the workplace.And what do the millennials feel? Well, they feel a lot, but what they're so fantastic about is \u2014 you know, our generation was like, \"Oh, we're going to get representation.\" So if you walk into a room, you see everybody represented. That's not good enough anymore, which is so good! So the millennials are fantastic; they want connection, engagement. They just want you to tell us what you're feeling, what you're thinking, and get into the solution. They're problem-solvers, and of course, you've got the information at your fingertips, compared to when I was growing up.PM: What did the research show you about millennials? Are they going to make a difference? Are they going to create a world where there is really an inclusive work force?BJK: Well, in 2025, 75 percent of the global workforce is going to be millennials. I think they are going to help solve problems. I think they have the wherewithal to do it. I know they care a lot. They have big ideas and they can make big things happen. I want to stay in the now with the young people, I don't want to get behind.(Laughter)PM: I don't think there's any chance! But what you found out in the research about millennials is not really the experience that a lot of people have with millennials.BJK: No, well, if we want to talk \u2014 OK, I've been doing my little mini-survey. I've been talking to the Boomers, who are their bosses, and I go, \"What do you think about the millennials?\" And I'm pretty excited, like it's good, and they get this face \u2014(Laughter)\"Oh, you mean the 'Me' generation?\"(Laughter)I say, \"Do you really think so? Because I do think they care about the environment and all these things.\" And they go, \"Oh, Billie, they cannot focus.\"(Laughter)They actually have proventhat the average focus for an 18-year-old is 37 seconds.(Laughter)They can't focus. And they don't really care. I just heard a story the other night: a woman owns a gallery and she has these workers. She gets a text from one of the workers, like an intern, she's just starting \u2014 she goes, \"Oh, by the way, I'm going to be late because I'm at the hairdresser's.\"(Laughter)So she arrives, and this boss says, \"What's going on?\" And she says, \"Oh, I was late, sorry, how's it going?\" She says, \"Well, guess what? I'd like you leave, you're finished.\" She goes, \"OK.\"(Laughter)No problem! PM: Now Billie, that story \u2014 I know, but that's what scares the boomers \u2014 I'm just telling you \u2014 so I think it's good for us to share.(Laughter)No, it is good for us to share, because we're our authentic selves and what we're really feeling, so we've got to take it both ways, you know? But I have great faith because \u2014 if you've been in sports like I have \u2014 every generation gets better. It's a fact. With the Women's Sports Foundation being the advocates for Title IX still, because we're trying to keep protecting the law, because it's in a tenuous position always, so we really are concerned, and we do a lot of research. That's very important to us. And I want to hear from people. But we really have to protect what Title IX stands for worldwide. And you heard President Carter talk about how Title IX is protected. And do you know that every single lawsuit that girls, at least in sports, have gone up against \u2014 whatever institutions \u2014 has won? Title IX is there to protect us. And it is amazing. But we still have to get the hearts and minds \u2014 the hearts and minds to match the legislation is huge.PM: So what gets you up every morning? What keeps you sustaining your work, sustaining the fight for equality, extending it, always exploring new areas, trying to find new ways ... ?BJK: Well, I always drove my parents crazy because I was always the curious one. I'm highly motivated. My younger brother was a Major League Baseball player. My poor parents did not care if we were any good.(Laughter)And we drove them crazy because we pushed, we pushed because we wanted to be the best. And I think it's because of what I'm hearing today in TED talks. I think to listen to these different women, to listen to different people, to listen to President Carter \u2014 90 years old, by the way, and he we was throwing these figures out that I would never \u2014 I'd have to go, \"Excuse me, wait a minute, I need to get a list out of these figures.\" He was rattling off \u2014 I mean, that's amazing, I'm sorry.PM: He's an amazing man.(Applause)BJK: And then you're going to have President Mary Robinson, who's a former president \u2014 Thank you, Irish! 62 percent! LGBTQ! Yes!(Applause)Congress is voting in June on same-sex marriage, so these are things that for some people are very hard to hear. But always remember, every one of us is an individual, a human being with a beating heart, who cares and wants to live their authentic life. OK? You don't have to agree with somebody, but everyone has the opportunity.I think we all have an obligation to continue to keep moving the needle forward, always. And these people have been so inspiring. Everyone matters. And every one of you is an influencer. You out there listening, out there in the world, plus the people here \u2014 every single person's an influencer. Never, ever forget that. OK? So don't ever give up on yourself.PM: Billie, you have been an inspiration for us.BJK: Thanks, Pat!(Applause)Thanks, TED!(Applause)Thanks a lot!", "id": 2327, "subtitle":

00:00:19.508\nThanks, Pat.\n\n00:00:19.532 --> 00:00:21.090\nThank you!\n\n00:00:23.878 --> 00:00:25.474\nGetting me all wound up, now!\n\n00:00:25.498 --> 00:00:26.504\n(Laughter)\n\n00:00:26.528 --> 00:00:27.715\nPat Mitchell: Good!\n\n00:00:28.599 --> 00:00:32.496\nYou know, when I was watching\nthe video again of the match,\n\n00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:37.009\nyou must have felt\nlike the fate of the world's women\n\n00:00:37.033 --> 00:00:39.631\nwas on every stroke you took.\n\n00:00:40.404 --> 00:00:41.921\nWere you feeling that?\n\n00:00:42.793 --> 00:00:46.112\nBJK: First of all, Bobby Riggs --\nhe was the former number one player,\n\n00:00:46.136 --> 00:00:48.138\nhe wasn't just some hacker, by the way.\n\n00:00:48.162 --> 00:00:51.044\nHe was one of my heroes and I admired him.\n\n00:00:51.806 --> 00:00:55.294\nAnd that's the reason I beat him,\nactually, because I respected him.\n\n00:00:55.318 --> 00:00:56.417\n(Laughter)\n\n00:00:56.441 --> 00:00:59.037\nIt's true -- my mom\nand especially my dad always said:\n\n00:00:59.061 --> 00:01:01.939\n\"Respect your opponent,\nand never underestimate them, ever.\"\n\n00:01:01.963 --> 00:01:04.251\nAnd he was correct.\nHe was absolutely correct.\n\n00:01:05.203 --> 00:01:07.240\nBut I knew it was about social change.\n\n00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:12.282\nAnd I was really nervous\nwhenever we announced it,\n\n00:01:12.306 --> 00:01:15.175\nand I felt like the whole world\nwas on my shoulders.\n\n00:01:15.199 --> 00:01:20.860\nAnd I thought, \"If I lose, it's going\nto put women back 50 years, at least.\"\n\n00:01:20.884 --> 00:01:24.781\nTitle IX had just been passed\nthe year before -- June 23, 1972.\n\n00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:28.424\nAnd women's professional tennis --\n\n00:01:28.448 --> 00:01:31.721\nthere were nine of us who signed\na one-dollar contract in 1970 --\n\n00:01:31.745 --> 00:01:33.844\nnow remember, the match is in '73.\n\n00:01:34.412 --> 00:01:37.572\nSo we were only in our\nthird year of having a tour\n\n00:01:37.596 --> 00:01:41.856\nwhere we could actually play,\nhave a place to compete and make a living.\n\n00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:44.876\nSo there were nine of us that signed\nthat one-dollar contract.\n\n00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:49.869\nAnd our dream was for any girl,\nborn any place in the world --\n\n00:01:49.893 --> 00:01:51.451\nif she was good enough --\n\n00:01:51.475 --> 00:01:55.586\nthere would be a place for her to compete\nand for us to make a living.\n\n00:01:55.610 --> 00:01:59.370\nBecause before 1968,\nwe made 14 dollars a day,\n\n00:01:59.394 --> 00:02:01.846\nand we were under the control\nof organizations.\n\n00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:04.063\nSo we really wanted\nto break away from that.\n\n00:02:04.087 --> 00:02:06.803\nBut we knew it wasn't really\nabout our generation so much;\n\n00:02:06.827 --> 00:02:08.877\nwe knew it was about\nthe future generations.\n\n00:02:08.901 --> 00:02:12.906\nWe do stand on the shoulders of the people\nthat came before us, there is no question.\n\n00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:15.463\nBut every generation\nhas the chance to make it better.\n\n00:02:16.223 --> 00:02:18.640\nThat was really on my mind.\n\n00:02:18.664 --> 00:02:22.283\nI really wanted to start matching\nthe hearts and minds to Title IX.\n\n00:02:22.307 --> 00:02:26.094\nTitle IX, in case anybody doesn't know,\nwhich a lot of people probably don't,\n\n00:02:26.118 --> 00:02:30.396\nsaid that any federal funds given\nto a high school, college or university,\n\n00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:32.494\neither public or private,\n\n00:02:32.518 --> 00:02:37.420\nhad to -- finally --\ngive equal monies to boys and girls.\n\n00:02:37.867 --> 00:02:39.358\nAnd that changed everything.\n\n00:02:39.382 --> 00:02:42.208\n(Applause)\n\n00:02:42.232 --> 00:02:43.990\nSo you can have a law,\n\n00:02:44.014 --> 00:02:46.929\nbut it's changing the hearts and minds\nto match up with it.\n\n00:02:46.953 --> 00:02:49.500\nThat's when it really rocks, totally.\n\n00:02:49.524 --> 00:02:50.675\nSo that was on my mind.\n\n00:02:50.699 --> 00:02:54.288\nI wanted to start that change\nin the hearts and minds.\n\n00:02:54.312 --> 00:02:57.104\nBut two things came out of that match.\n\n00:02:57.128 --> 00:03:00.284\nFor women: self-confidence, empowerment.\n\n00:03:00.308 --> 00:03:02.850\nThey actually had enough nerve\nto ask for a raise.\n\n00:03:03.633 --> 00:03:07.474\nSome women have waited\n10, 15 years to ask.\n\n00:03:07.796 --> 00:03:09.797\nI said, \"More importantly,\ndid you get it?\"\n\n00:03:09.821 --> 00:03:10.889\n(Laughter)\n\n00:03:10.913 --> 00:03:12.087\nAnd they did!\n\n00:03:12.111 --> 00:03:13.905\nAnd for the men?\n\n00:03:13.929 --> 00:03:16.760\nA lot of the men today don't realize it,\n\n00:03:16.784 --> 00:03:22.189\nbut if you're in your 50s, 60s\nor whatever, late 40s,\n\n00:03:22.213 --> 00:03:25.789\nyou're the first generation of men\nof the Women's Movement --\n\n00:03:25.813 --> 00:03:27.105\nwhether you like it or not!\n\n00:03:27.129 --> 00:03:30.151\n(Laughter)\n\n00:03:30.175 --> 00:03:31.458\n(Applause)\n\n00:03:31.482 --> 00:03:32.633\nAnd for the men,\n\n00:03:32.657 --> 00:03:35.272\nwhat happened for the men,\nthey'd come up to me --\n\n00:03:35.296 --> 00:03:38.397\nand most times, the men are the ones\nwho have tears in their eyes,\n\n00:03:38.421 --> 00:03:39.572\nit's very interesting.\n\n00:03:39.596 --> 00:03:43.609\nThey go, \"Billie, I was very young\nwhen I saw that match,\n\n00:03:43.633 --> 00:03:44.987\nand now I have a daughter.\n\n00:03:47.151 --> 00:03:49.948\nAnd I am so happy I saw that\nas a young man.\"\n\n00:03:50.546 --> 00:03:54.095\nAnd one of those young men,\nat 12 years old, was President Obama.\n\n00:03:54.892 --> 00:03:57.612\nAnd he actually told me that\nwhen I met him, he said:\n\n00:03:57.636 --> 00:04:00.594\n\"You don't realize it,\nbut I saw that match at 12.\n\n00:04:00.618 --> 00:04:02.471\nAnd now I have two daughters,\n\n00:04:02.495 --> 00:04:04.921\nand it has made a difference\nin how I raise them.\"\n\n00:04:04.945 --> 00:04:09.662\nSo both men and women got a lot\nout of it, but different things.\n\n00:04:10.234 --> 00:04:13.389\nPM: And now there are generations --\nat least one or two --\n\n00:04:13.413 --> 00:04:16.113\nwho have experienced the equality\n\n00:04:16.137 --> 00:04:21.023\nthat Title IX and other fights\nalong the way made possible.\n\n00:04:21.047 --> 00:04:25.638\nAnd for women, there are generations\nwho have also experienced teamwork.\n\n00:04:25.662 --> 00:04:29.712\nThey got to play team sports\nin a way they hadn't before.\n\n00:04:30.104 --> 00:04:35.185\nSo you had a legacy already built\nin terms of being an athlete,\n\n00:04:35.209 --> 00:04:40.464\na legacy of the work you did\nto lobby for equal pay for women athletes\n\n00:04:40.488 --> 00:04:42.762\nand the Women's Sports Foundation.\n\n00:04:43.326 --> 00:04:46.028\nWhat now are you looking to accomplish\n\n00:04:46.052 --> 00:04:49.008\nwith The Billie Jean King\nLeadership Initiative?\n\n00:04:49.318 --> 00:04:52.166\nBJK: I think it goes back\nto an epiphany I had at 12.\n\n00:04:52.190 --> 00:04:55.191\nAt 11, I wanted to be the number one\ntennis player in the world,\n\n00:04:55.215 --> 00:04:58.526\nand a friend had asked me to play\nand I said, \"What's that?\"\n\n00:04:59.056 --> 00:05:02.531\nTennis was not in my family --\nbasketball was, other sports.\n\n00:05:02.555 --> 00:05:04.423\nFast forward to 12 years old,\n\n00:05:04.447 --> 00:05:06.044\n(Laughter)\n\n00:05:06.068 --> 00:05:08.282\nand I'm finally starting\nto play in tournaments\n\n00:05:08.306 --> 00:05:10.757\nwhere you get a ranking\nat the end of the year.\n\n00:05:11.390 --> 00:05:14.759\nSo I was daydreaming\nat the Los Angeles Tennis Club,\n\n00:05:14.783 --> 00:05:19.547\nand I started thinking about my sport\nand how tiny it was,\n\n00:05:19.571 --> 00:05:23.220\nbut also that everybody who played\nwore white shoes, white clothes,\n\n00:05:23.244 --> 00:05:26.138\nplayed with white balls --\neverybody who played was white.\n\n00:05:26.838 --> 00:05:31.800\nAnd I said to myself, at 12 years old,\n\"Where is everyone else?\"\n\n00:05:34.180 --> 00:05:37.331\nAnd that just kept sticking in my brain.\n\n00:05:37.355 --> 00:05:38.506\nAnd that moment,\n\n00:05:38.530 --> 00:05:41.484\nI promised myself I'd fight\nfor equal rights and opportunities\n\n00:05:41.508 --> 00:05:44.256\nfor boys and girls, men and women,\nthe rest of my life.\n\n00:05:44.737 --> 00:05:48.949\nAnd that tennis, if I was fortunate\nenough to become number one --\n\n00:05:48.973 --> 00:05:52.464\nand I knew, being a girl,\nit would be harder to have influence,\n\n00:05:52.488 --> 00:05:54.465\nalready at that age --\n\n00:05:54.489 --> 00:05:56.535\nthat I had this platform.\n\n00:05:58.259 --> 00:05:59.927\nAnd tennis is global.\n\n00:06:01.409 --> 00:06:03.150\nAnd I thought, \"You know what?\n\n00:06:04.121 --> 00:06:07.049\nI've been given an opportunity\nthat very few people have had.\"\n\n00:06:07.073 --> 00:06:10.028\nI didn't know if I was going\nto make it -- this was only 12.\n\n00:06:10.052 --> 00:06:13.180\nI sure wanted it, but making it\nis a whole other discussion.\n\n00:06:13.204 --> 00:06:17.407\nI just remember I promised myself,\nand I really try to keep my word.\n\n00:06:18.132 --> 00:06:21.934\nThat's who I truly am,\njust fighting for people.\n\n00:06:21.958 --> 00:06:26.168\nAnd, unfortunately, women have had less.\n\n00:06:26.989 --> 00:06:29.258\nAnd we are considered less.\n\n00:06:29.282 --> 00:06:31.550\nAnd so my attentions,\nwhere did they have to go?\n\n00:06:31.574 --> 00:06:33.759\nIt was just ... you have to.\n\n00:06:33.783 --> 00:06:37.014\nAnd learn to stick up for yourself,\nhear your own voice.\n\n00:06:37.038 --> 00:06:40.375\nYou hear the same words\nkeep coming out all the time,\n\n00:06:40.399 --> 00:06:44.116\nand I got really lucky\nbecause I had an education.\n\n00:06:44.140 --> 00:06:46.708\nAnd I think if you can see it\nyou can be it, you know?\n\n00:06:46.732 --> 00:06:48.948\nIf you can see it, you can be it.\n\n00:06:48.972 --> 00:06:50.976\nYou look at Pat,\nyou look at other leaders,\n\n00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:53.146\nyou look at these speakers,\nlook at yourself,\n\n00:06:53.170 --> 00:06:54.828\nbecause everyone --\n\n00:06:54.852 --> 00:06:56.210\neveryone --\n\n00:06:56.234 --> 00:06:58.047\ncan do something extraordinary.\n\n00:06:58.071 --> 00:06:59.513\nEvery single person.\n\n00:06:59.537 --> 00:07:03.770\nPM: And your story, Billie,\nhas inspired so many women everywhere.\n\n00:07:04.245 --> 00:07:07.116\nNow with the Billie Jean King\nLeadership Initiative,\n\n00:07:07.140 --> 00:07:09.324\nyou're taking on an even bigger cause.\n\n00:07:09.348 --> 00:07:13.372\nBecause one thing we hear a lot\nabout is women taking their voice,\n\n00:07:13.396 --> 00:07:16.823\nworking to find their way\ninto leadership positions.\n\n00:07:16.847 --> 00:07:19.679\nBut what you're talking\nabout is even bigger than that.\n\n00:07:19.703 --> 00:07:21.932\nIt's inclusive leadership.\n\n00:07:21.956 --> 00:07:25.546\nAnd this is a generation that has grown up\nthinking more inclusively --\n\n00:07:25.570 --> 00:07:27.691\nBJK: Isn't it great?\nLook at the technology!\n\n00:07:27.715 --> 00:07:32.267\nIt's amazing how it connects us all!\nIt's about connection.\n\n00:07:32.291 --> 00:07:35.905\nIt's simply amazing\nwhat's possible because of it.\n\n00:07:35.929 --> 00:07:38.369\nBut the Billie Jean King\nLeadership Initiative\n\n00:07:38.393 --> 00:07:41.457\nis really about the workforce mostly,\nand trying to change it,\n\n00:07:41.481 --> 00:07:45.826\nso people can actually go to work\nand be their authentic selves.\n\n00:07:45.850 --> 00:07:48.887\nBecause most of us have two jobs:\n\n00:07:48.911 --> 00:07:51.530\nOne, to fit in -- I'll give you\na perfect example.\n\n00:07:51.554 --> 00:07:54.885\nAn African American woman\ngets up an hour earlier to go to work,\n\n00:07:54.909 --> 00:07:56.710\nstraightens her hair in the bathroom,\n\n00:07:56.734 --> 00:07:59.917\ngoes to the bathroom\nprobably four, five, six times a day\n\n00:07:59.941 --> 00:08:03.029\nto keep straightening her hair,\nto keep making sure she fits in.\n\n00:08:03.053 --> 00:08:04.323\nSo she's working two jobs.\n\n00:08:04.347 --> 00:08:06.732\nShe's got this other job,\nwhatever that may be,\n\n00:08:06.756 --> 00:08:08.966\nbut she's also trying to fit in.\n\n00:08:08.990 --> 00:08:13.033\nOr this poor man who kept his diploma --\n\n00:08:13.057 --> 00:08:14.773\nhe went to University of Michigan,\n\n00:08:14.797 --> 00:08:18.118\nbut he never would talk about\nhis poverty as a youngster, ever --\n\n00:08:18.142 --> 00:08:19.461\njust would not mention it.\n\n00:08:19.485 --> 00:08:21.734\nSo he made sure they saw\nhe was well-educated.\n\n00:08:22.296 --> 00:08:24.740\nAnd then you see a gay guy\nwho has an NFL --\n\n00:08:24.764 --> 00:08:27.405\nwhich means American football\nfor all of you out there,\n\n00:08:27.429 --> 00:08:29.380\nit's a big deal, it's very macho --\n\n00:08:29.405 --> 00:08:31.427\nand he talked about football all the time,\n\n00:08:31.451 --> 00:08:35.031\nbecause he was gay\nand he didn't want anybody to know.\n\n00:08:35.055 --> 00:08:36.832\nIt just goes on and on.\n\n00:08:36.856 --> 00:08:42.969\nSo my wish for everyone is to be able\nto be their authentic self 24/7,\n\n00:08:42.993 --> 00:08:44.799\nthat would be the ultimate.\n\n00:08:44.823 --> 00:08:48.349\nAnd we catch ourselves -- I mean,\nI catch myself to this day.\n\n00:08:48.373 --> 00:08:50.520\nEven being gay I catch myself,\nyou know, like,\n\n00:08:50.544 --> 00:08:51.694\n(Gasp)\n\n00:08:52.422 --> 00:08:55.510\na little uncomfortable,\na little surge in my gut,\n\n00:08:55.534 --> 00:08:58.602\nfeeling not totally\ncomfortable in my own skin.\n\n00:09:00.613 --> 00:09:02.842\nSo, I think you have to ask yourself --\n\n00:09:02.866 --> 00:09:06.013\nI want people to be themselves,\nwhatever that is, just let it be.\n\n00:09:06.037 --> 00:09:09.749\nPM: And the first research\nthe Leadership Initiative did showed that,\n\n00:09:09.773 --> 00:09:13.009\nthat these examples you just used --\n\n00:09:13.033 --> 00:09:17.838\nthat many of us have the problem\nof being authentic.\n\n00:09:17.862 --> 00:09:21.887\nBut what you've just looked at\nis this millennial generation,\n\n00:09:21.911 --> 00:09:25.449\nwho have benefited from all these\nequal opportunities --\n\n00:09:25.473 --> 00:09:27.634\nwhich may not be equal\nbut exist everywhere --\n\n00:09:27.658 --> 00:09:29.377\nBJK: First of all, I'm really lucky.\n\n00:09:29.401 --> 00:09:33.933\nPartnership with Teneo,\na strategic company that's amazing.\n\n00:09:33.957 --> 00:09:36.130\nThat's really the reason\nI'm able to do this.\n\n00:09:36.475 --> 00:09:37.936\nI've had two times in my life\n\n00:09:37.960 --> 00:09:40.646\nwhere I've actually had men\nreally behind me with power.\n\n00:09:40.670 --> 00:09:43.960\nAnd that was in the old days\nwith Philip Morris with Virginia Slims,\n\n00:09:43.984 --> 00:09:46.318\nand this is the second time\nin my entire life.\n\n00:09:46.342 --> 00:09:47.691\nAnd then Deloitte.\n\n00:09:49.115 --> 00:09:51.900\nThe one thing I wanted was data -- facts.\n\n00:09:52.423 --> 00:09:54.150\nSo Deloitte sent out a survey,\n\n00:09:54.174 --> 00:09:58.179\nand over 4,000 people now have answered,\n\n00:09:58.203 --> 00:10:00.087\nand we're continuing in the workplace.\n\n00:10:00.829 --> 00:10:03.258\nAnd what do the millennials feel?\n\n00:10:04.115 --> 00:10:07.376\nWell, they feel a lot, but what\nthey're so fantastic about is --\n\n00:10:07.400 --> 00:10:10.929\nyou know, our generation was like,\n\"Oh, we're going to get representation.\"\n\n00:10:10.953 --> 00:10:13.741\nSo if you walk into a room,\nyou see everybody represented.\n\n00:10:13.765 --> 00:10:16.235\nThat's not good enough anymore,\nwhich is so good!\n\n00:10:16.259 --> 00:10:20.479\nSo the millennials are fantastic;\nthey want connection, engagement.\n\n00:10:20.503 --> 00:10:23.927\nThey just want you to tell us\nwhat you're feeling, what you're thinking,\n\n00:10:23.951 --> 00:10:25.204\nand get into the solution.\n\n00:10:25.228 --> 00:10:26.466\nThey're problem-solvers,\n\n00:10:26.490 --> 00:10:29.365\nand of course, you've got\nthe information at your fingertips,\n\n00:10:29.389 --> 00:10:32.091\ncompared to when I was growing up.\n\n00:10:32.115 --> 00:10:34.643\nPM: What did the research show you\nabout millennials?\n\n00:10:34.667 --> 00:10:36.386\nAre they going to make a difference?\n\n00:10:36.410 --> 00:10:40.427\nAre they going to create a world where\nthere is really an inclusive work force?\n\n00:10:40.451 --> 00:10:46.343\nBJK: Well, in 2025,\n75 percent of the global workforce\n\n00:10:46.367 --> 00:10:47.807\nis going to be millennials.\n\n00:10:48.160 --> 00:10:50.447\nI think they are going\nto help solve problems.\n\n00:10:50.471 --> 00:10:52.567\nI think they have\nthe wherewithal to do it.\n\n00:10:52.591 --> 00:10:54.162\nI know they care a lot.\n\n00:10:54.186 --> 00:10:58.662\nThey have big ideas\nand they can make big things happen.\n\n00:10:59.007 --> 00:11:01.325\nI want to stay in the now\nwith the young people,\n\n00:11:01.349 --> 00:11:03.243\nI don't want to get behind.\n\n00:11:04.631 --> 00:11:06.302\n(Laughter)\n\n00:11:06.326 --> 00:11:08.132\nPM: I don't think there's any chance!\n\n00:11:09.562 --> 00:11:12.557\nBut what you found out\nin the research about millennials\n\n00:11:12.581 --> 00:11:17.208\nis not really the experience that a lot\nof people have with millennials.\n\n00:11:17.232 --> 00:11:20.996\nBJK: No, well, if we want to talk --\nOK, I've been doing my little mini-survey.\n\n00:11:21.020 --> 00:11:25.903\nI've been talking to the Boomers,\nwho are their bosses, and I go,\n\n00:11:25.927 --> 00:11:27.973\n\"What do you think about the millennials?\"\n\n00:11:27.997 --> 00:11:29.873\nAnd I'm pretty excited, like it's good,\n\n00:11:29.897 --> 00:11:31.353\nand they get this face --\n\n00:11:31.377 --> 00:11:33.693\n(Laughter)\n\n00:11:33.717 --> 00:11:35.399\n\"Oh, you mean the 'Me' generation?\"\n\n00:11:35.423 --> 00:11:37.004\n(Laughter)\n\n00:11:37.028 --> 00:11:38.516\nI say, \"Do you really think so?\n\n00:11:38.540 --> 00:11:41.422\nBecause I do think they care\nabout the environment\n\n00:11:41.446 --> 00:11:42.741\nand all these things.\"\n\n00:11:43.400 --> 00:11:47.885\nAnd they go, \"Oh, Billie,\nthey cannot focus.\"\n\n00:11:47.909 --> 00:11:50.611\n(Laughter)\n\n00:11:50.635 --> 00:11:52.254\nThey actually have proven\n\n00:11:52.278 --> 00:11:55.772\nthat the average focus\nfor an 18-year-old is 37 seconds.\n\n00:11:55.796 --> 00:11:57.365\n(Laughter)\n\n00:11:57.389 --> 00:11:58.788\nThey can't focus.\n\n00:11:58.812 --> 00:12:00.221\nAnd they don't really care.\n\n00:12:00.245 --> 00:12:02.086\nI just heard a story the other night:\n\n00:12:02.110 --> 00:12:04.540\na woman owns a gallery\nand she has these workers.\n\n00:12:05.505 --> 00:12:08.670\nShe gets a text from one of the workers,\n\n00:12:08.694 --> 00:12:11.342\nlike an intern, she's\njust starting -- she goes,\n\n00:12:11.366 --> 00:12:14.749\n\"Oh, by the way, I'm going to be late\nbecause I'm at the hairdresser's.\"\n\n00:12:14.773 --> 00:12:19.685\n(Laughter)\n\n00:12:19.709 --> 00:12:23.521\nSo she arrives, and this boss says,\n\n00:12:23.545 --> 00:12:24.696\n\"What's going on?\"\n\n00:12:24.720 --> 00:12:27.246\nAnd she says, \"Oh, I was late,\nsorry, how's it going?\"\n\n00:12:27.270 --> 00:12:31.370\nShe says, \"Well, guess what?\nI'd like you leave, you're finished.\"\n\n00:12:31.394 --> 00:12:32.760\nShe goes, \"OK.\"\n\n00:12:32.784 --> 00:12:35.986\n(Laughter)\n\n00:12:36.010 --> 00:12:37.161\nNo problem!\n\n00:12:37.185 --> 00:12:38.607\nPM: Now Billie, that story --\n\n00:12:38.631 --> 00:12:41.065\nI know, but that's what\nscares the boomers --\n\n00:12:41.089 --> 00:12:43.952\nI'm just telling you --\nso I think it's good for us to share.\n\n00:12:43.976 --> 00:12:45.545\n(Laughter)\n\n00:12:45.569 --> 00:12:47.052\nNo, it is good for us to share,\n\n00:12:47.076 --> 00:12:50.145\nbecause we're our authentic selves\nand what

00:13:04.329\nWith the Women's Sports Foundation\nbeing the advocates for Title IX still,\n\n00:13:04.353 --> 00:13:06.606\nbecause we're trying\nto keep protecting the law,\n\n00:13:06.630 -->

for worldwide.\n\n00:13:22.838 --> 00:13:27.604\nAnd you heard President Carter\ntalk about how Title IX is protected.\n\n00:13:28.556 --> 00:13:32.150\nAnd do you know that every single

minds --\n\n00:13:47.770 --> 00:13:50.507\nthe hearts and minds\nto match the legislation is huge.\n\n00:13:50.531 --> 00:13:52.614\nPM: So what gets you up every morning?\n\n00:13:52.638 -->

I would like you to feel comfortable with my doing that by letting you know that I know something about fear and anxiety. I'm a Jewish guy from New Jersey.(Laughter)I could worry before I could walk.(Laughter)Please, applaud that.(Applause)Thank you.But I also grew up in a time where there was something to fear. We were brought out in the hall when I was a little kid and taught how to put our coats over our heads to protect us from global thermonuclear war. Now even my seven-year-old brain knew that wasn't going to work. But I also knew that global thermonuclear war was something to be concerned with.And yet, despite the fact that we lived for 50 years with the threat of such a war, the response of our government and of our society was to do wonderful things. We created the space program in response to that. We built our highway system in response to that. We created the Internet in response to that. So sometimes fear can produce a constructive response. But sometimes it can produce an un-constructive response.On September 11, 2001, 19 guys took over four airplanes and flew them into a couple of buildings. They exacted a horrible toll. It is not for us to minimize what that toll was. But the response that we had was clearly disproportionate \u2014 disproportionate to the point of verging on the unhinged. We rearranged the national security apparatus of the United States and of many governments to address a threat that, at the time that those attacks took place, was quite limited. In fact, according to our intelligence services, on September 11, 2001, there were 100 members of core Al-Qaeda. There were just a few thousand terrorists. They posed an existential threat to no one.But we rearranged our entire national security apparatus in the most sweeping way since the end of the Second World War. We launched two wars. We spent trillions of dollars. We suspended our values. We violated international law. We embraced torture. We embraced the idea that if these 19 guys could do this, anybody could do it. And therefore, for the first time in history, we were seeing everybody as a threat. And what was the result of that? Surveillance programs that listened in on the emails and phone calls of entire countries \u2014 hundreds of millions of people \u2014 setting aside whether those countries were our allies, setting aside what our interests were. I would argue that 15 years later, since today there are more terrorists, more terrorist attacks, more terrorist casualties \u2014 this by the count of the U.S. State Department \u2014 since today the region from which those attacks emanate is more unstable than at any time in its history, since the Flood, perhaps, we have not succeeded in our response.Now you have to ask, where did we go wrong? What did we do? What was the mistake that was made? And you might say, well look, Washington is a dysfunctional place. There are political food fights. We've turned our discourse into a cage match. And that's true. But there are bigger problems, believe it or not, than that dysfunction, even though I would argue that dysfunction that makes it impossible to get anything done in the richest and most powerful country in the world is far more dangerous than anything that a group like ISIS could do, because it stops us in our tracks and it keeps us from progress.But there are other problems. And the other problems came from the fact that in Washington and in many capitals right now, we're in a creativity crisis. In Washington, in think tanks, where people are supposed to be thinking of new ideas, you don't get bold new ideas, because if you offer up a bold new idea, not only are you attacked on Twitter, but you will not get confirmed in a government job. Because we are reactive to the heightened venom of the political debate, you get governments that have an us-versus-them mentality, tiny groups of people making decisions. When you sit in a room with a small group of people making decisions, what do you get? You get groupthink. Everybody has the same worldview, and any view from outside of the group is seen as a threat. That's a danger. You also have processes that become reactive to news cycles. And so the parts of the U.S. government that do foresight, that look forward, that do strategy \u2014 the parts in other governments that do this \u2014 can't do it, because they're reacting to the news cycle. And so we're not looking ahead.On 9/11, we had a crisis because we were looking the wrong way. Today we have a crisis because, because of 9/11, we are still looking in the wrong direction, and we know because we see transformational trends on the horizon that are far more important than what we saw on 9/11; far more important than the threat posed by these terrorists; far more important even than the instability that we've got in some areas of the world that are racked by instability today. In fact, the things that we are seeing in those parts of the world may be symptoms. They may be a reaction to bigger trends. And if we are treating the symptom and ignoring the bigger trend, then we've got far bigger problems to deal with.And so what are those trends? Well, to a group like you, the trends are apparent. We are living at a moment in which the very fabric of human society is being rewoven. If you saw the cover of The Economist a couple of days ago \u2014 it said that 80 percent of the people on the planet, by the year 2020, would have a smartphone. They would have a small computer connected to the Internet in their pocket. In most of Africa, the cell phone penetration rate is 80 percent. We passed the point last October when there were more mobile cellular devices, SIM cards, out in the world than there were people. We are within years of a profound moment in our history, when effectively every single human being on the planet is going to be part of a man-made system for the first time, able to touch anyone else \u2014 touch them for good, touch them for ill. And the changes associated with that are changing the very nature of every aspect of governance and life on the planet in ways that our leaders ought to be thinking about, when they're thinking about these immediate threats.On the security side, we've come out of a Cold War in which it was too costly to fight a nuclear war, and so we didn't, to a period that I call Cool War, cyber war, where the costs of conflict are actually so low, that we may never stop. We may enter a period of constant warfare, and we know this because we've been in it for several years. And yet, we don't have the basic doctrines to guide us in this regard. We don't have the basic ideas formulated. If someone attacks us with a cyber attack, do have the ability to respond with a kinetic attack? We don't know. If somebody launches a cyber attack, how do we deter them? When China launched a series of cyber attacks, what did the U.S. government do? It said, we're going to indict a few of these Chinese guys, who are never coming to America. They're never going to be anywhere near a law enforcement officer who's going to take them into custody. It's a gesture \u2014 it's not a deterrent.Special forces operators out there in the field today discover that small groups of insurgents with cell phones have access to satellite imagery that once only superpowers had. In fact, if you've got a cell phone, you've got access to power that a superpower didn't have, and would have highly classified 10 years ago. In my cell phone, I have an app that tells me where every plane in the world is, and its altitude, and its speed, and what kind of aircraft it is, and where it's going and where it's landing. They have apps that allow them to know what their adversary is about to do. They're using these tools in new ways. When a cafe in Sydney was taken over by a terrorist, he went in with a rifle... and an iPad. And the weapon was the iPad. Because he captured people, he terrorized them, he pointed the iPad at them, and then he took the video and he put it on the Internet, and he took over the world's media.But it doesn't just affect the security side. The relations between great powers \u2014 we thought we were past the bipolar era. We thought we were in a unipolar world, where all the big issues were resolved. Remember? It was the end of history. But we're not. We're now seeing that our basic assumptions about the Internet \u2014 that it was going to connect us, weave society together \u2014 are not necessarily true. In countries like China, you have the Great Firewall of China. You've got countries saying no, if the Internet happens within our borders we control it within our borders. We control the content. We are going to control our security. We are going to manage that Internet. We are going to say what can be on it. We're going to set a different set of rules. Now you might think, well, that's just China. But it's not just China. It's China, India, Russia. It's Saudi Arabia, it's Singapore, it's Brazil. After the NSA scandal, the Russians, the Chinese, the Indians, the Brazilians, they said, let's create a new Internet backbone, because we can't be dependent on this other one. And so all of a sudden, what do you have? You have a new bipolar world in which cyber-internationalism, our belief, is challenged by cyber-nationalism, another belief.We are seeing these changes everywhere we look. We are seeing the advent of mobile money. It's happening in the places you wouldn't expect. It's happening in Kenya and Tanzania, where millions of people who haven't had access to financial services now conduct all those services on their phones. There are 2.5 million people who don't have financial service access that are going to get it soon. A billion of them are going to have the ability to access it on their cell phone soon. It's not just going to give them the ability to bank. It's going to change what monetary policy is. It's going to change what money is. Education is changing in the same way. Healthcare is changing in the same way. How government services are delivered is changing in the same way.And yet, in Washington, we are debating whether to call the terrorist group that has taken over Syria and Iraq ISIS or ISIL or Islamic State. We are trying to determine how much we want to give in a negotiation with the Iranians on a nuclear deal which deals with the technologies of 50 years ago, when in fact, we know that the Iranians right now are engaged in cyber war with us and we're ignoring it, partially because businesses are not willing to talk about the attacks that are being waged on them.And that gets us to another breakdown that's crucial, and another breakdown that couldn't be more important to a group like this, because the growth of America and real American national security and all of the things that drove progress even during the Cold War, was a public-private partnership between science, technology and government that began when Thomas Jefferson sat alone in his laboratory inventing new things. But it was the canals and railroads and telegraph; it was radar and the Internet. It was Tang, the breakfast drink \u2014 probably not the most important of those developments. But what you had was a partnership and a dialogue, and the dialogue has broken down. It's broken down because in Washington, less government is considered more. It's broken down because there is, believe it or not, in Washington, a war on science \u2014 despite the fact that in all of human history, every time anyone has waged a war on science, science has won.(Applause)But we have a government that doesn't want to listen, that doesn't have people at the highest levels that understand this. In the nuclear age, when there were people in senior national security jobs, they were expected to speak throw-weight. They were expected to know the lingo, the vocabulary. If you went to the highest level of the U.S. government now and said, \"Talk to me about cyber, about neuroscience, about the things that are going to change the world of tomorrow,\" you'd get a blank stare. I know, because when I wrote this book, I talked to 150 people, many from the science and tech side, who felt like they were being shunted off to the kids' table. Meanwhile, on the tech side, we have lots of wonderful people creating wonderful things, but they started in garages and they didn't need the government and they don't want the government. Many of them have a political view that's somewhere between libertarian and anarchic: leave me alone.But the world's coming apart. All of a sudden, there are going to be massive regulatory changes and massive issues associated with conflict and massive issues associated with security and privacy. And we haven't even gotten to the next set of issues, which are philosophical issues. If you can't vote, if you can't have a job, if you can't bank, if you can't get health care, if you can't be educated without Internet access, is Internet access a fundamental right that should be written into constitutions? If Internet access is a fundamental right, is electricity access for the 1.2 billion who don't have access to electricity a fundamental right? These are fundamental issues. Where are the philosophers? Where's the dialogue?And that brings me to the reason that I'm here. I live in Washington. Pity me.(Laughter)The dialogue isn't happening there. These big issues that will change the world, change national security, change economics, create hope, create threats, can only be resolved when you bring together groups of people who understand science and technology back together with government. Both sides need each other. And until we recreate that connection, until we do what helped America grow and helped other countries grow, then we are going to grow ever more vulnerable. The risks associated with 9/11 will not be measured in terms of lives lost by terror attacks or buildings destroyed or trillions of dollars spent. They'll be measured in terms of the costs of our distraction from critical issues and our inability to get together scientists, technologists, government leaders, at a moment of transformation akin to the beginning of the Renaissance, akin to the beginning of the major transformational eras that have happened on Earth, and start coming up with, if not the right answers, then at least the right questions.We are not there yet, but discussions like this and groups like you are the places where those questions can be formulated and posed. And that's why I believe that groups like TED, discussions like this around the planet, are the place where the future of foreign policy, of economic policy, of social policy, of philosophy, will ultimately take place. And that's why it's been a pleasure speaking to you.Thank you very, very much.(Applause)", "id": 2326, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:12.837 -->

2001,\n\n00:02:35.538 --> 00:02:38.767\nthere were 100 members of core Al-Qaeda.\n\n00:02:39.372 --> 00:02:41.862\nThere were just a few thousand terrorists.\n\n00:02:42.315 --> 00:02:45.429\nThey

problems\n\n00:04:45.273 --> 00:04:48.829\ncame from the fact that in Washington\nand in many capitals right now,\n\n00:04:48.853 --> 00:04:50.644\nwe're in a creativity crisis.\n\n00:04:51.066 --> 00:04:53.713\nIn Washington, in think tanks,\n\n00:04:53.737 --> 00:04:56.855\nwhere people are supposed to be\nthinking of new ideas,\n\n00:04:56.879 --> 00:04:58.945\nyou don't get bold new ideas,\n\n00:04:58.969 --> 00:05:01.836\nbecause if you offer up a bold new idea,\n\n00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:03.712\nnot only are you attacked on Twitter,\n\n00:05:03.736 --> 00:05:07.087\nbut you will not get confirmed\nin a government job.\n\n00:05:07.111 --> 00:05:12.340\nBecause we are reactive to the heightened\nvenom of the political debate,\n\n00:05:12.364 --> 00:05:15.474\nyou get governments that have\nan us-versus-them mentality,\n\n00:05:15.498 --> 00:05:17.895\ntiny groups of people making decisions.\n\n00:05:17.919 --> 00:05:21.201\nWhen you sit in a room with a small group\nof people making decisions,\n\n00:05:21.225 --> 00:05:22.384\nwhat do you get?\n\n00:05:22.408 --> 00:05:24.048\nYou get groupthink.\n\n00:05:24.072 --> 00:05:25.661\nEverybody has the same worldview,\n\n00:05:25.685 --> 00:05:28.951\nand any view from outside of the group\nis seen as a threat.\n\n00:05:29.324 --> 00:05:30.554\nThat's a danger.\n\n00:05:31.216 --> 00:05:35.477\nYou also have processes\nthat become reactive to news cycles.\n\n00:05:35.501 --> 00:05:39.794\nAnd so the parts of the U.S. government\nthat do foresight, that look forward,\n\n00:05:39.818 --> 00:05:40.973\nthat do strategy --\n\n00:05:40.997 --> 00:05:43.760\nthe parts in other governments\nthat do this -- can't do it,\n\n00:05:43.784 --> 00:05:45.942\nbecause they're reacting\nto the news cycle.\n\n00:05:46.341 --> 00:05:48.245\nAnd so we're not looking ahead.\n\n00:05:48.269 --> 00:05:52.067\nOn 9/11, we had a crisis\nbecause we were looking the wrong way.\n\n00:05:52.485 --> 00:05:55.912\nToday we have a crisis because,\nbecause of 9/11,\n\n00:05:55.936 --> 00:05:58.587\nwe are still looking\nin the wrong direction,\n\n00:05:58.611 --> 00:06:04.459\nand we know because we see\ntransformational trends on the horizon\n\n00:06:04.483 --> 00:06:09.335\nthat are far more important\nthan what we saw on 9/11;\n\n00:06:09.359 --> 00:06:13.161\nfar more important than the threat\nposed by these terrorists;\n\n00:06:13.185 --> 00:06:16.435\nfar more important even\nthan the instability that we've got\n\n00:06:16.459 --> 00:06:20.710\nin some areas of the world\nthat are racked by instability today.\n\n00:06:21.119 --> 00:06:25.779\nIn fact, the things that we are seeing\nin those parts of the world\n\n00:06:25.803 --> 00:06:28.417\nmay be symptoms.\n\n00:06:28.841 --> 00:06:32.319\nThey may be a reaction to bigger trends.\n\n00:06:32.343 --> 00:06:37.047\nAnd if we are treating the symptom\nand ignoring the bigger trend,\n\n00:06:37.071 --> 00:06:40.135\nthen we've got far bigger\nproblems to deal with.\n\n00:06:41.373 --> 00:06:42.870\nAnd so what are those trends?\n\n00:06:43.468 --> 00:06:45.245\nWell, to a group like you,\n\n00:06:45.269 --> 00:06:46.760\nthe trends are apparent.\n\n00:06:48.402 --> 00:06:53.657\nWe are living at a moment\nin which the very fabric of human society\n\n00:06:53.681 --> 00:06:55.470\nis being rewoven.\n\n00:06:57.015 --> 00:07:00.235\nIf you saw the cover of The Economist\na couple of days ago --\n\n00:07:00.259 --> 00:07:03.805\nit said that 80 percent\nof the people on the planet,\n\n00:07:03.829 --> 00:07:06.762\nby the year 2020, would have a smartphone.\n\n00:07:07.522 --> 00:07:11.375\nThey would have a small computer\nconnected to the Internet in their pocket.\n\n00:07:11.766 --> 00:07:16.291\nIn most of Africa, the cell phone\npenetration rate is 80 percent.\n\n00:07:17.707 --> 00:07:20.371\nWe passed the point last October\n\n00:07:20.395 --> 00:07:24.366\nwhen there were more\nmobile cellular devices, SIM cards,\n\n00:07:24.390 --> 00:07:26.506\nout in the world than there were people.\n\n00:07:27.124 --> 00:07:33.020\nWe are within years\nof a profound moment in our history,\n\n00:07:33.044 --> 00:07:38.401\nwhen effectively every single\nhuman being on the planet\n\n00:07:38.425 --> 00:07:43.033\nis going to be part of a man-made\nsystem for the first time,\n\n00:07:43.057 --> 00:07:45.098\nable to touch anyone else --\n\n00:07:45.122 --> 00:07:47.484\ntouch them for good, touch them for ill.\n\n00:07:47.957 --> 00:07:53.783\nAnd the changes associated with that\nare changing the very nature\n\n00:07:53.807 --> 00:07:57.408\nof every aspect of governance\nand life on the planet\n\n00:07:57.432 --> 00:08:00.878\nin ways that our leaders\nought to be thinking about,\n\n00:08:00.902 --> 00:08:03.382\nwhen they're thinking about\nthese immediate threats.\n\n00:08:03.782 --> 00:08:05.548\nOn the security side,\n\n00:08:05.572 --> 00:08:11.076\nwe've come out of a Cold War in which\nit was too costly to fight a nuclear war,\n\n00:08:11.100 --> 00:08:12.634\nand so we didn't,\n\n00:08:12.658 --> 00:08:16.475\nto a period that I call\nCool War, cyber war,\n\n00:08:16.499 --> 00:08:21.550\nwhere the costs of conflict are actually\nso low, that we may never stop.\n\n00:08:22.095 --> 00:08:24.821\nWe may enter a period of constant warfare,\n\n00:08:24.845 --> 00:08:29.256\nand we know this because\nwe've been in it for several years.\n\n00:08:29.280 --> 00:08:34.831\nAnd yet, we don't have the basic doctrines\nto guide us in this regard.\n\n00:08:35.213 --> 00:08:37.304\nWe don't have the basic ideas formulated.\n\n00:08:37.328 --> 00:08:39.868\nIf someone attacks us with a cyber attack,\n\n00:08:39.892 --> 00:08:43.007\ndo have the ability to respond\nwith a kinetic attack?\n\n00:08:43.745 --> 00:08:44.952\nWe don't know.\n\n00:08:45.531 --> 00:08:49.616\nIf somebody launches a cyber attack,\nhow do we deter them?\n\n00:08:49.640 --> 00:08:51.827\nWhen China launched\na series of cyber attacks,\n\n00:08:51.851 --> 00:08:53.378\nwhat did the U.S. government do?\n\n00:08:53.402 --> 00:08:57.387\nIt said, we're going to indict\na few of these Chinese guys,\n\n00:08:57.411 --> 00:08:59.153\nwho are never coming to America.\n\n00:08:59.855 --> 00:09:03.804\nThey're never going to be anywhere near\na law enforcement officer\n\n00:09:03.828 --> 00:09:05.833\nwho's going to take them into custody.\n\n00:09:06.210 --> 00:09:09.100\nIt's a gesture -- it's not a deterrent.\n\n00:09:09.636 --> 00:09:13.434\nSpecial forces operators\nout there in the field today\n\n00:09:13.458 --> 00:09:18.329\ndiscover that small groups\nof insurgents with cell phones\n\n00:09:18.353 --> 00:09:23.624\nhave access to satellite imagery\nthat once only superpowers had.\n\n00:09:23.648 --> 00:09:25.815\nIn fact, if you've got a cell phone,\n\n00:09:25.839 --> 00:09:29.155\nyou've got access to power\nthat a superpower didn't have,\n\n00:09:29.179 --> 00:09:31.334\nand would have highly\nclassified 10 years ago.\n\n00:09:31.358 --> 00:09:34.249\nIn my cell phone,\nI have an app that tells me\n\n00:09:34.273 --> 00:09:38.813\nwhere every plane in the world is,\nand its altitude, and its speed,\n\n00:09:38.837 --> 00:09:40.659\nand what kind of aircraft it is,\n\n00:09:40.683 --> 00:09:43.599\nand where it's going\nand where it's landing.\n\n00:09:44.387 --> 00:09:48.936\nThey have apps that allow them to know\n\n00:09:48.960 --> 00:09:51.179\nwhat their adversary is about to do.\n\n00:09:51.203 --> 00:09:53.579\nThey're using these tools in new ways.\n\n00:09:53.603 --> 00:09:57.717\nWhen a cafe in Sydney\nwas taken over by a terrorist,\n\n00:09:57.741 --> 00:10:00.034\nhe went in with a rifle...\n\n00:10:00.058 --> 00:10:01.301\nand an iPad.\n\n00:10:01.894 --> 00:10:04.455\nAnd the weapon was the iPad.\n\n00:10:04.957 --> 00:10:08.256\nBecause he captured people,\nhe terrorized them,\n\n00:10:08.280 --> 00:10:10.985\nhe pointed the iPad at them,\n\n00:10:11.009 --> 00:10:13.681\nand then he took the video\nand he put it on the Internet,\n\n00:10:13.705 --> 00:10:15.728\nand he took over the world's media.\n\n00:10:17.819 --> 00:10:21.287\nBut it doesn't just affect\nthe security side.\n\n00:10:22.090 --> 00:10:23.919\nThe relations between great powers --\n\n00:10:23.943 --> 00:10:26.308\nwe thought we were past the bipolar era.\n\n00:10:27.217 --> 00:10:29.091\nWe thought we were in a unipolar world,\n\n00:10:29.115 --> 00:10:31.009\nwhere all the big issues were resolved.\n\n00:10:31.033 --> 00:10:32.750\nRemember? It was the end of history.\n\n00:10:34.087 --> 00:10:35.383\nBut we're not.\n\n00:10:35.407 --> 00:10:39.795\nWe're now seeing that our\nbasic assumptions about the Internet --\n\n00:10:39.819 --> 00:10:43.880\nthat it was going to connect us,\nweave society together --\n\n00:10:43.904 --> 00:10:45.560\nare not necessarily true.\n\n00:10:46.041 --> 00:10:49.237\nIn countries like China,\nyou have the Great Firewall of China.\n\n00:10:49.261 --> 00:10:52.781\nYou've got countries saying no,\nif the Internet happens within our borders\n\n00:10:52.805 --> 00:10:54.380\nwe control it within our borders.\n\n00:10:54.404 --> 00:10:57.264\nWe control the content.\nWe are going to control our security.\n\n00:10:57.288 --> 00:10:59.054\nWe are going to manage that Internet.\n\n00:10:59.078 --> 00:11:00.891\nWe are going to say what can be on it.\n\n00:11:00.915 --> 00:11:02.966\nWe're going to set\na different set of rules.\n\n00:11:02.990 --> 00:11:05.087\nNow you might think,\nwell, that's just China.\n\n00:11:05.111 --> 00:11:06.825\nBut it's not just China.\n\n00:11:07.609 --> 00:11:10.338\nIt's China, India, Russia.\n\n00:11:10.666 --> 00:11:13.766\nIt's Saudi Arabia,\nit's Singapore, it's Brazil.\n\n00:11:13.790 --> 00:11:18.304\nAfter the NSA scandal, the Russians,\nthe Chinese, the Indians, the Brazilians,\n\n00:11:18.328 --> 00:11:21.383\nthey said, let's create\na new Internet backbone,\n\n00:11:21.407 --> 00:11:23.889\nbecause we can't be dependent\non this other one.\n\n00:11:23.913 --> 00:11:25.882\nAnd so all of a sudden, what do you have?\n\n00:11:26.358 --> 00:11:28.857\nYou have a new bipolar world\n\n00:11:28.881 --> 00:11:31.072\nin which cyber-internationalism,\n\n00:11:31.096 --> 00:11:32.247\nour belief,\n\n00:11:32.271 --> 00:11:35.108\nis challenged by cyber-nationalism,\n\n00:11:35.132 --> 00:11:36.397\nanother belief.\n\n00:11:37.551 --> 00:11:40.722\nWe are seeing these changes\neverywhere we look.\n\n00:11:41.587 --> 00:11:43.565\nWe are seeing the advent of mobile money.\n\n00:11:43.589 --> 00:11:45.886\nIt's happening in the places\nyou wouldn't expect.\n\n00:11:45.910 --> 00:11:48.287\nIt's happening in Kenya and Tanzania,\n\n00:11:48.311 --> 00:11:51.580\nwhere millions of people who haven't\nhad access to financial services\n\n00:11:51.604 --> 00:11:54.099\nnow conduct all those\nservices on their phones.\n\n00:11:54.660 --> 00:11:59.160\nThere are 2.5 million people\nwho don't have financial service access\n\n00:11:59.184 --> 00:12:01.200\nthat are going to get it soon.\n\n00:12:01.698 --> 00:12:04.511\nA billion of them are going\nto have the ability to access it\n\n00:12:04.535 --> 00:12:05.730\non their cell phone soon.\n\n00:12:05.754 --> 00:12:08.607\nIt's not just going to give them\nthe ability to bank.\n\n00:12:08.915 --> 00:12:11.792\nIt's going to change\nwhat monetary policy is.\n\n00:12:11.816 --> 00:12:14.452\nIt's going to change what money is.\n\n00:12:15.220 --> 00:12:17.391\nEducation is changing in the same way.\n\n00:12:18.388 --> 00:12:20.849\nHealthcare is changing in the same way.\n\n00:12:20.873 --> 00:12:24.367\nHow government services are delivered\nis changing in the same way.\n\n00:12:25.565 --> 00:12:29.827\nAnd yet, in Washington, we are debating\n\n00:12:29.851 --> 00:12:35.316\nwhether to call the terrorist group\nthat has taken over Syria and Iraq\n\n00:12:35.340 --> 00:12:39.500\nISIS or ISIL or Islamic State.\n\n00:12:40.498 --> 00:12:43.609\nWe are trying to determine\n\n00:12:43.633 --> 00:12:48.922\nhow much we want to give\nin a negotiation with the Iranians\n\n00:12:48.946 --> 00:12:53.745\non a nuclear deal which deals\nwith the technologies of 50 years ago,\n\n00:12:53.769 --> 00:12:59.127\nwhen in fact, we know that the Iranians\nright now are engaged in cyber war with us\n\n00:12:59.151 --> 00:13:05.185\nand we're ignoring it, partially\nbecause businesses are not willing\n\n00:13:05.209 --> 00:13:08.327\nto talk about the attacks\nthat are being waged on them.\n\n00:13:09.357 --> 00:13:12.166\nAnd that gets us to another breakdown\n\n00:13:12.190 --> 00:13:13.414\nthat's crucial,\n\n00:13:13.438 --> 00:13:17.149\nand another breakdown that couldn't be\nmore important to a group like this,\n\n00:13:17.173 --> 00:13:20.825\nbecause the growth of America\nand real American national security\n\n00:13:20.849 --> 00:13:25.290\nand all of the things that drove progress\neven during the Cold War,\n\n00:13:25.314 --> 00:13:30.065\nwas a public-private partnership\nbetween science, technology and government\n\n00:13:30.089 --> 00:13:33.597\nthat began when Thomas Jefferson\nsat alone in his laboratory\n\n00:13:33.621 --> 00:13:35.464\ninventing new things.\n\n00:13:36.486 --> 00:13:40.296\nBut it was the canals\nand railroads and telegraph;\n\n00:13:40.320 --> 00:13:42.636\nit was radar and the Internet.\n\n00:13:43.087 --> 00:13:45.371\nIt was Tang, the breakfast drink --\n\n00:13:45.395 --> 00:13:48.272\nprobably not the most important\nof those developments.\n\n00:13:48.753 --> 00:13:51.632\nBut what you had was\na partnership and a dialogue,\n\n00:13:51.656 --> 00:13:53.921\nand the dialogue has broken down.\n\n00:13:53.945 --> 00:13:56.324\nIt's broken down because in Washington,\n\n00:13:56.348 --> 00:13:58.114\nless government is considered more.\n\n00:13:58.138 --> 00:14:00.617\nIt's broken down because there is,\nbelieve it or not,\n\n00:14:00.641 --> 00:14:02.481\nin Washington, a war on science --\n\n00:14:02.505 --> 00:14:05.544\ndespite the fact that\nin all of human history,\n\n00:14:05.568 --> 00:14:08.528\nevery time anyone has waged\na war on science,\n\n00:14:08.552 --> 00:14:10.153\nscience has won.\n\n00:14:11.421 --> 00:14:16.348\n(Applause)\n\n00:14:16.670 --> 00:14:20.866\nBut we have a government\nthat doesn't want to listen,\n\n00:14:20.890 --> 00:14:23.049\nthat doesn't have people\nat the highest levels\n\n00:14:23.073 --> 00:14:24.227\nthat understand this.\n\n00:14:24.251 --> 00:14:25.402\nIn the nuclear age,\n\n00:14:25.426 --> 00:14:28.593\nwhen there were people\nin senior national security jobs,\n\n00:14:28.617 --> 00:14:31.645\nthey were expected to speak throw-weight.\n\n00:14:31.963 --> 00:14:34.981\nThey were expected

People have created and invested millions of dollars into non-profit organizations with the mission of helping people who are poor.They've created think tanks that study issues like education, job creation and asset-building, and then advocated for policies to support our most marginalized communities. They've written books and columns and given passionate speeches, decrying the wealth gap that is leaving more and more people entrenched at the bottom end of the income scale. And that effort has helped. But it's not enough. Our poverty rates haven't changed that much in the last 50 years, since the War on Poverty was launched. I'm here to tell you that we have overlooked the most powerful and practical resource. Here it is: people who are poor.Up in the left-hand corner is Jobana, Sintia and Bertha. They met when they all had small children, through a parenting class at a family resource center in San Francisco. As they grew together as parents and friends, they talked a lot about how hard it was to make money when your kids are little. Child care is expensive, more than they'd earn in a job. Their husbands worked, but they wanted to contribute financially, too.So they hatched a plan. They started a cleaning business. They plastered neighborhoods with flyers and handed business cards out to their families and friends, and soon, they had clients calling. Two of them would clean the office or house and one of them would watch the kids. They'd rotate who'd cleaned and who'd watch the kids. (Laughs) It's awesome, right?(Laughter)And they split the money three ways. It was not a full-time gig, no one could watch the little ones all day. But it made a difference for their families. Extra money to pay for bills when a husband's work hours were cut. Money to buy the kids clothes as they were growing. A little extra money in their pockets to make them feel some independence.Up in the top-right corner is Theresa and her daughter, Brianna. Brianna is one of those kids with this sparkly, infectious, outgoing personality. For example, when Rosie, a little girl who spoke only Spanish, moved in next door, Brianna, who spoke only English, borrowed her mother's tablet and found a translation app so the two of them could communicate.(Laughter)I know, right? Rosie's family credits Brianna with helping Rosie to learn English.A few years ago, Brianna started to struggle academically. She was growing frustrated and kind of withdrawn and acting out in class. And her mother was heartbroken over what was happening. Then they found out that she was going to have to repeat second grade and Brianna was devastated. Her mother felt hopeless and overwhelmed and alone because she knew that her daughter was not getting the support she needed, and she did not know how to help her. One afternoon, Theresa was catching up with a group of friends, and one of them said, \"Theresa, how are you?\" And she burst into tears. After she shared her story, one of her friends said, \"I went through the exact same thing with my son about a year ago.\" And in that moment, Theresa realized that so much of her struggle was not having anybody to talk with about it. So she created a support group for parents like her. The first meeting was her and two other people. But word spread, and soon 20 people, 30 people were showing up for these monthly meetings that she put together. She went from feeling helpless to realizing how capable she was of supporting her daughter, with the support of other people who were going through the same struggle. And Brianna is doing fantastic \u2014 she's doing great academically and socially.That in the middle is my man Baakir, standing in front of BlackStar Books and Caffe, which he runs out of part of his house. As you walk in the door, Baakir greets you with a \"Welcome black home.\"(Laughter)Once inside, you can order some Algiers jerk chicken, perhaps a vegan walnut burger, or jive turkey sammich. And that's sammich \u2014 not sandwich. You must finish your meal with a buttermilk drop, which is several steps above a donut hole and made from a very secret family recipe. For real, it's very secret, he won't tell you about it.But BlackStar is much more than a caf\u00e9. For the kids in the neighborhood, it's a place to go after school to get help with homework. For the grown-ups, it's where they go to find out what's going on in the neighborhood and catch up with friends. It's a performance venue. It's a home for poets, musicians and artists. Baakir and his partner Nicole, with their baby girl strapped to her back, are there in the mix of it all, serving up a cup of coffee, teaching a child how to play Mancala, or painting a sign for an upcoming community event.I have worked with and learned from people just like them for more than 20 years. I have organized against the prison system, which impacts poor folks, especially black, indigenous and Latino folks, at an alarming rate. I have worked with young people who manifest hope and promise, despite being at the effect of racist discipline practices in their schools, and police violence in their communities. I have learned from families who are unleashing their ingenuity and tenacity to collectively create their own solutions. And they're not just focused on money. They're addressing education, housing, health, community \u2014 the things that we all care about. Everywhere I go, I see people who are broke but not broken. I see people who are struggling to realize their good ideas, so that they can create a better life for themselves, their families, their communities. Jobana, Sintia, Bertha, Theresa and Baakir are the rule, not the shiny exception. I am the exception.I was raised by a quietly fierce single mother in Rochester, New York. I was bussed to a school in the suburbs, from a neighborhood that many of my classmates and their parents considered dangerous. At eight, I was a latchkey kid. I'd get myself home after school every day and do homework and chores, and wait for my mother to come home. After school, I'd go to the corner store and buy a can of Chef Boyardee ravioli, which I'd heat up on the stove as my afternoon snack. If I had a little extra money, I'd buy a Hostess Fruit Pie.(Laughter)Cherry. Not as good as a buttermilk drop.(Laughter)We were poor when I was a kid. But now, I own a home in a quickly gentrifying neighborhood in Oakland, California. I've built a career. My husband is a business owner. I have a retirement account. My daughter is not even allowed to turn on the stove unless there's a grown-up at home and she doesn't have to, because she does not have to have the same kind of self-reliance that I had to at her age. My kids' raviolis are organic and full of things like spinach and ricotta, because I have the luxury of choice when it comes to what my children eat.I am the exception, not because I'm more talented than Baakir or my mother worked any harder than Jobana, Sintia or Bertha, or cared any more than Theresa. Marginalized communities are full of smart, talented people, hustling and working and innovating, just like our most revered and most rewarded CEOs. They are full of people tapping into their resilience to get up every day, get the kids off to school and go to jobs that don't pay enough, or get educations that are putting them in debt. They are full of people applying their savvy intelligence to stretch a minimum wage paycheck, or balance a job and a side hustle to make ends meet. They are full of people doing for themselves and for others, whether it's picking up medication for an elderly neighbor, or letting a sibling borrow some money to pay the phone bill, or just watching out for the neighborhood kids from the front stoop.I am the exception because of luck and privilege, not hard work. And I'm not being modest or self-deprecating \u2014 I am amazing.(Laughter)But most people work hard. Hard work is the common denominator in this equation, and I'm tired of the story we tell that hard work leads to success, because that allows \u2014Thank you.(Applause)... because that story allows those of us who make it to believe we deserve it, and by implication, those who don't make it don't deserve it. We tell ourselves, in the back of our minds, and sometimes in the front of our mouths, \"There must be something a little wrong with those poor people.\" We have a wide range of beliefs about what that something wrong is. Some people tell the story that poor folks are lazy freeloaders who would cheat and lie to get out of an honest day's work. Others prefer the story that poor people are helpless and probably had neglectful parents that didn't read to them enough, and if they were just told what to do and shown the right path, they could make it.For every story I hear demonizing low-income single mothers or absentee fathers, which is how people might think of my parents, I've got 50 that tell a different story about the same people, showing up every day and doing their best. I'm not saying that some of the negative stories aren't true, but those stories allow us to not really see who people really are, because they don't paint a full picture. The quarter-truths and limited plot lines have us convinced that poor people are a problem that needs fixing. What if we recognized that what's working is the people and what's broken is our approach? What if we realized that the experts we are looking for, the experts we need to follow, are poor people themselves? What if, instead of imposing solutions, we just added fire to the already-burning flame that they have? Not directing \u2014 not even empowering \u2014 but just fueling their initiative.Just north of here, we have an example of what this could look like: Silicon Valley. A whole venture capital industry has grown up around the belief that if people have good ideas and the desire to manifest them, we should give them lots and lots and lots of money.(Laughter)Right? But where is our strategy for Theresa and Baakir? There are no incubators for them, no accelerators, no fellowships. How are Jobana, Sintia and Bertha really all that different from the Mark Zuckerbergs of the world? Baakir has experience and a track record. I'd put my money on him.So, consider this an invitation to rethink a flawed strategy. Let's grasp this opportunity to let go of a tired, faulty narrative and listen and look for true stories, more beautifully complex stories, about who marginalized people and families and communities are.I'm going to take a minute to speak to my people. We cannot wait for somebody else to get it right. Let us remember what we are capable of; all that we have built with blood, sweat and dreams; all the cogs that keep turning; and the people kept afloat because of our backbreaking work. Let us remember that we are magic. If you need some inspiration to jog your memory, read Octavia Butler's \"Parable of the Sower.\" Listen to Reverend King's \"Letter from Birmingham Jail.\" Listen to Suheir Hammad recite \"First Writing Since,\" or Esperanza Spalding perform \"Black Gold.\" Set your gaze upon the art of Kehinde Wiley or Favianna Rodriguez. Look at the hands of your grandmother or into the eyes of someone who loves you. We are magic. Individually, we don't have a lot of wealth and power, but collectively, we are unstoppable. And we spend a lot of our time and energy organizing our power to demand change from systems that were not made for us. Instead of trying to alter the fabric of existing ways, let's weave and cut some fierce new cloth. Let's use some of our substantial collective power toward inventing and bringing to life new ways of being that work for us.Desmond Tutu talks about the concept of ubuntu, in the context of South Africa's Truth and Reconciliation process that they embarked on after apartheid. He says it means, \"My humanity is caught up, is inextricably bound up, in yours; we belong to a bundle of life.\" A bundle of life. The Truth and Reconciliation process started by elevating the voices of the unheard. If this country is going to live up to its promise of liberty and justice for all, then we need to elevate the voices of our unheard, of people like Jobana, Sintia and Bertha, Theresa and Baakir. We must leverage their solutions and their ideas. We must listen to their true stories, their more beautifully complex stories.Thank you.(Applause)", "id": 2328, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:12.799

00:02:59.350\n(Laughter)\n\n00:02:59.374 --> 00:03:00.556\nI know, right?\n\n00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:04.483\nRosie's family credits Brianna\nwith helping Rosie to learn English.\n\n00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:07.035\nA few years ago,\n\n00:03:07.059 --> 00:03:09.846\nBrianna started to struggle academically.\n\n00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:14.685\nShe was growing frustrated\nand kind of withdrawn\n\n00:03:14.709 --> 00:03:16.957\nand acting out in class.\n\n00:03:16.981 --> 00:03:20.811\nAnd her mother was heartbroken\nover what was happening.\n\n00:03:21.655 --> 00:03:24.917\nThen they found out that she was going\nto have to repeat second grade\n\n00:03:24.941 --> 00:03:26.954\nand Brianna was devastated.\n\n00:03:26.978 --> 00:03:32.149\nHer mother felt hopeless\nand overwhelmed and alone\n\n00:03:32.173 --> 00:03:35.677\nbecause she knew that her daughter\nwas not getting the support she needed,\n\n00:03:35.701 --> 00:03:37.639\nand she did not know how to help her.\n\n00:03:37.663 --> 00:03:41.227\nOne afternoon, Theresa was catching up\nwith a group of friends,\n\n00:03:41.251 --> 00:03:42.810\nand one of them said,\n\n00:03:42.834 --> 00:03:44.770\n\"Theresa, how are you?\"\n\n00:03:45.302 --> 00:03:47.016\nAnd she burst into tears.\n\n00:03:47.762 --> 00:03:51.103\nAfter she shared her story,\none of her friends said,\n\n00:03:51.127 --> 00:03:54.404\n\"I went through the exact same thing\nwith my son about a year ago.\"\n\n00:03:54.428 --> 00:03:55.579\nAnd in that moment,\n\n00:03:55.603 --> 00:03:57.860\nTheresa realized\nthat so much of her struggle\n\n00:03:57.884 --> 00:04:00.386\nwas not having anybody\nto talk with about it.\n\n00:04:00.942 --> 00:04:04.289\nSo she created a support group\nfor parents like her.\n\n00:04:05.059 --> 00:04:08.393\nThe first meeting was her\nand two other people.\n\n00:04:08.417 --> 00:04:11.458\nBut word spread, and soon\n20 people, 30 people\n\n00:04:11.482 --> 00:04:14.857\nwere showing up for these\nmonthly meetings that she put together.\n\n00:04:14.881 --> 00:04:17.098\nShe went from feeling helpless\n\n00:04:17.122 --> 00:04:20.751\nto realizing how capable she was\nof supporting her daughter,\n\n00:04:20.775 --> 00:04:24.456\nwith the support of other people\nwho were going through the same struggle.\n\n00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:27.517\nAnd Brianna is doing fantastic --\nshe's doing great academically\n\n00:04:27.541 --> 00:04:28.718\nand socially.\n\n00:04:29.792 --> 00:04:33.178\nThat in the middle is my man Baakir,\n\n00:04:33.202 --> 00:04:36.047\nstanding in front of\nBlackStar Books and Caffe,\n\n00:04:36.071 --> 00:04:38.656\nwhich he runs out of part of his house.\n\n00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:40.255\nAs you walk in the door,\n\n00:04:40.279 --> 00:04:43.663\nBaakir greets you\nwith a \"Welcome black home.\"\n\n00:04:43.687 --> 00:04:46.465\n(Laughter)\n\n00:04:46.489 --> 00:04:50.532\nOnce inside, you can order\nsome Algiers jerk chicken,\n\n00:04:50.556 --> 00:04:53.079\nperhaps a vegan walnut burger,\n\n00:04:53.103 --> 00:04:55.453\nor jive turkey sammich.\n\n00:04:55.477 --> 00:04:58.370\nAnd that's sammich -- not sandwich.\n\n00:04:58.394 --> 00:05:02.625\nYou must finish your meal\nwith a buttermilk drop,\n\n00:05:02.649 --> 00:05:05.007\nwhich is several steps above a donut hole\n\n00:05:05.031 --> 00:05:07.718\nand made from a very secret family recipe.\n\n00:05:08.155 --> 00:05:10.972\nFor real, it's very secret,\nhe won't tell you about it.\n\n00:05:11.422 --> 00:05:14.655\nBut BlackStar is much more than a caf\u00e9.\n\n00:05:15.004 --> 00:05:16.609\nFor the kids in the neighborhood,\n\n00:05:16.633 --> 00:05:19.638\nit's a place to go after school\nto get help with homework.\n\n00:05:19.662 --> 00:05:21.455\nFor the grown-ups, it's where they go\n\n00:05:21.479 --> 00:05:23.682\nto find out what's going on\nin the neighborhood\n\n00:05:23.706 --> 00:05:25.063\nand catch up with friends.\n\n00:05:25.087 --> 00:05:26.564\nIt's a performance venue.\n\n00:05:26.588 --> 00:05:29.918\nIt's a home for poets,\nmusicians and artists.\n\n00:05:30.382 --> 00:05:32.566\nBaakir and his partner Nicole,\n\n00:05:32.590 --> 00:05:34.730\nwith their baby girl strapped to her back,\n\n00:05:34.754 --> 00:05:36.308\nare there in the mix of it all,\n\n00:05:36.332 --> 00:05:38.403\nserving up a cup of coffee,\n\n00:05:38.427 --> 00:05:40.567\nteaching a child how to play Mancala,\n\n00:05:40.591 --> 00:05:43.646\nor painting a sign\nfor an upcoming community event.\n\n00:05:44.140 --> 00:05:48.386\nI have worked with and learned\nfrom people just like them\n\n00:05:48.410 --> 00:05:50.051\nfor more than 20 years.\n\n00:05:50.075 --> 00:05:52.918\nI have organized\nagainst the prison system,\n\n00:05:52.942 --> 00:05:55.275\nwhich impacts poor folks,\n\n00:05:55.299 --> 00:05:57.843\nespecially black, indigenous\nand Latino folks,\n\n00:05:57.867 --> 00:05:59.295\nat an alarming rate.\n\n00:05:59.716 --> 00:06:03.231\nI have worked with young people\nwho manifest hope and promise,\n\n00:06:03.255 --> 00:06:07.664\ndespite being at the effect of racist\ndiscipline practices in their schools,\n\n00:06:07.688 --> 00:06:10.124\nand police violence in their communities.\n\n00:06:10.563 --> 00:06:12.449\nI have learned from families\n\n00:06:12.473 --> 00:06:16.155\nwho are unleashing\ntheir ingenuity and tenacity\n\n00:06:16.179 --> 00:06:18.369\nto collectively create\ntheir own solutions.\n\n00:06:18.393 --> 00:06:20.497\nAnd they're not just focused on money.\n\n00:06:20.869 --> 00:06:24.565\nThey're addressing education,\nhousing, health, community --\n\n00:06:24.589 --> 00:06:26.787\nthe things that we all care about.\n\n00:06:28.218 --> 00:06:29.601\nEverywhere I go,\n\n00:06:29.625 --> 00:06:32.759\nI see people who are broke but not broken.\n\n00:06:33.221 --> 00:06:37.040\nI see people who are struggling\nto realize their good ideas,\n\n00:06:37.064 --> 00:06:39.632\nso that they can create\na better life for themselves,\n\n00:06:39.656 --> 00:06:42.194\ntheir families, their communities.\n\n00:06:43.274 --> 00:06:49.762\nJobana, Sintia, Bertha, Theresa\nand Baakir are the rule,\n\n00:06:49.786 --> 00:06:51.402\nnot the shiny exception.\n\n00:06:51.881 --> 00:06:53.211\nI am the exception.\n\n00:06:54.498 --> 00:06:59.067\nI was raised by a quietly fierce\nsingle mother in Rochester, New York.\n\n00:06:59.583 --> 00:07:02.525\nI was bussed to a school\nin the suburbs, from a neighborhood\n\n00:07:02.549 --> 00:07:06.436\nthat many of my classmates\nand their parents considered dangerous.\n\n00:07:06.460 --> 00:07:08.455\nAt eight, I was a latchkey kid.\n\n00:07:08.891 --> 00:07:13.299\nI'd get myself home after school every day\nand do homework and chores,\n\n00:07:13.323 --> 00:07:15.309\nand wait for my mother to come home.\n\n00:07:15.333 --> 00:07:17.525\nAfter school, I'd go to the corner store\n\n00:07:17.549 --> 00:07:20.051\nand buy a can of Chef Boyardee ravioli,\n\n00:07:20.075 --> 00:07:22.698\nwhich I'd heat up on the stove\nas my afternoon snack.\n\n00:07:23.103 --> 00:07:25.910\nIf I had a little extra money,\nI'd buy a Hostess Fruit Pie.\n\n00:07:25.934 --> 00:07:26.935\n(Laughter)\n\n00:07:26.959 --> 00:07:28.110\nCherry.\n\n00:07:28.134 --> 00:07:29.788\nNot as good as a buttermilk drop.\n\n00:07:29.812 --> 00:07:30.813\n(Laughter)\n\n00:07:30.837 --> 00:07:32.531\nWe were poor when I was a kid.\n\n00:07:32.555 --> 00:07:36.348\nBut now, I own a home\nin a quickly gentrifying neighborhood\n\n00:07:36.372 --> 00:07:37.901\nin Oakland, California.\n\n00:07:38.321 --> 00:07:39.968\nI've built a career.\n\n00:07:40.333 --> 00:07:42.778\nMy husband is a business owner.\n\n00:07:43.563 --> 00:07:45.327\nI have a retirement account.\n\n00:07:46.263 --> 00:07:48.840\nMy daughter is not even allowed\nto turn on the stove\n\n00:07:48.864 --> 00:07:50.443\nunless there's a grown-up at home\n\n00:07:50.467 --> 00:07:51.625\nand she doesn't have to,\n\n00:07:51.649 --> 00:07:54.912\nbecause she does not have to have\nthe same kind of self-reliance\n\n00:07:54.936 --> 00:07:56.729\nthat I had to at her age.\n\n00:07:56.753 --> 00:07:58.957\nMy kids' raviolis are organic\n\n00:07:58.981 --> 00:08:01.888\nand full of things\nlike spinach and ricotta,\n\n00:08:01.912 --> 00:08:04.235\nbecause I have the luxury of choice\n\n00:08:04.259 --> 00:08:06.177\nwhen it comes to what my children eat.\n\n00:08:06.201 --> 00:08:08.301\nI am the exception,\n\n00:08:08.325 --> 00:08:10.657\nnot because I'm more talented than Baakir\n\n00:08:10.681 --> 00:08:14.563\nor my mother worked any harder\nthan Jobana, Sintia or Bertha,\n\n00:08:14.587 --> 00:08:16.544\nor cared any more than Theresa.\n\n00:08:17.353 --> 00:08:22.459\nMarginalized communities are full\nof smart, talented people,\n\n00:08:22.483 --> 00:08:24.797\nhustling and working and innovating,\n\n00:08:24.821 --> 00:08:28.762\njust like our most revered\nand most rewarded CEOs.\n\n00:08:28.786 --> 00:08:31.419\nThey are full of people\ntapping into their resilience\n\n00:08:31.443 --> 00:08:33.945\nto get up every day,\nget the kids off to school\n\n00:08:33.969 --> 00:08:35.955\nand go to jobs that don't pay enough,\n\n00:08:35.979 --> 00:08:38.447\nor get educations\nthat are putting them in debt.\n\n00:08:38.808 --> 00:08:43.612\nThey are full of people applying\ntheir savvy intelligence\n\n00:08:43.636 --> 00:08:46.023\nto stretch a minimum wage paycheck,\n\n00:08:46.047 --> 00:08:49.234\nor balance a job and a side hustle\nto make ends meet.\n\n00:08:49.585 --> 00:08:53.360\nThey are full of people\ndoing for themselves and for others,\n\n00:08:53.384 --> 00:08:56.888\nwhether it's picking up medication\nfor an elderly neighbor,\n\n00:08:56.912 --> 00:09:00.646\nor letting a sibling borrow some money\nto pay the phone bill,\n\n00:09:00.670 --> 00:09:02.913\nor just watching out\nfor the neighborhood kids\n\n00:09:02.937 --> 00:09:04.145\nfrom the front stoop.\n\n00:09:05.217 --> 00:09:08.604\nI am the exception\nbecause of luck and privilege,\n\n00:09:08.628 --> 00:09:09.913\nnot hard work.\n\n00:09:09.937 --> 00:09:12.275\nAnd I'm not being modest\nor self-deprecating --\n\n00:09:12.299 --> 00:09:13.450\nI am amazing.\n\n00:09:13.474 --> 00:09:14.692\n(Laughter)\n\n00:09:14.716 --> 00:09:16.330\nBut most people work hard.\n\n00:09:16.788 --> 00:09:20.957\nHard work is the common\ndenominator in this equation,\n\n00:09:20.981 --> 00:09:23.350\nand I'm tired of the story we tell\n\n00:09:23.374 --> 00:09:25.982\nthat hard work leads to success,\n\n00:09:26.006 --> 00:09:27.543\nbecause that allows --\n\n00:09:27.567 --> 00:09:28.757\nThank you.\n\n00:09:28.781 --> 00:09:32.272\n(Applause)\n\n00:09:33.467 --> 00:09:38.080\n... because that story allows those of us\nwho make it to believe we deserve it,\n\n00:09:38.104 --> 00:09:39.337\nand by implication,\n\n00:09:39.361 --> 00:09:41.594\nthose who don't make it don't deserve it.\n\n00:09:42.133 --> 00:09:44.336\nWe tell ourselves,\nin the back of our minds,\n\n00:09:44.360 --> 00:09:46.635\nand sometimes in the front of our mouths,\n\n00:09:46.659 --> 00:09:49.696\n\"There must be something a little wrong\nwith those poor people.\"\n\n00:09:49.720 --> 00:09:51.212\nWe have a wide range of beliefs\n\n00:09:51.236 --> 00:09:53.421\nabout what that something wrong is.\n\n00:09:53.445 --> 00:09:56.729\nSome people tell the story\nthat poor folks are lazy freeloaders\n\n00:09:56.753 --> 00:09:59.935\nwho would cheat and lie\nto get out of an honest day's work.\n\n00:10:00.245 --> 00:10:03.158\nOthers prefer the story\nthat poor people are helpless\n\n00:10:03.182 --> 00:10:06.463\nand probably had neglectful parents\nthat didn't read to them enough,\n\n00:10:06.487 --> 00:10:08.696\nand if they were just told what to do\n\n00:10:08.720 --> 00:10:09.977\nand shown the right path,\n\n00:10:10.001 --> 00:10:11.242\nthey could make it.\n\n00:10:11.875 --> 00:10:18.014\nFor every story I hear demonizing\nlow-income single mothers\n\n00:10:18.038 --> 00:10:19.387\nor absentee fathers,\n\n00:10:19.411 --> 00:10:22.153\nwhich is how people\nmight think of my parents,\n\n00:10:22.177 --> 00:10:27.039\nI've got 50 that tell a different story\nabout the same people,\n\n00:10:27.063 --> 00:10:29.973\nshowing up every day and doing their best.\n\n00:10:30.449 --> 00:10:34.165\nI'm not saying that some\nof the negative stories aren't true,\n\n00:10:34.189 --> 00:10:40.553\nbut those stories allow us\nto not really see who people really are,\n\n00:10:40.577 --> 00:10:42.764\nbecause they don't paint a full picture.\n\n00:10:43.207 --> 00:10:47.056\nThe quarter-truths and limited\nplot lines have us convinced\n\n00:10:47.080 --> 00:10:50.338\nthat poor people are a problem\nthat needs fixing.\n\n00:10:51.528 --> 00:10:55.797\nWhat if we recognized\nthat what's working is the people\n\n00:10:55.821 --> 00:10:58.375\nand what's broken is our approach?\n\n00:10:58.399 --> 00:11:01.924\nWhat if we realized that the experts\nwe are looking for,\n\n00:11:01.948 --> 00:11:03.744\nthe experts we need to follow,\n\n00:11:03.768 --> 00:11:05.689\nare poor people themselves?\n\n00:11:05.713 --> 00:11:08.716\nWhat if, instead of imposing solutions,\n\n00:11:08.740 --> 00:11:10.839\nwe just added fire\n\n00:11:10.863 --> 00:11:13.807\nto the already-burning flame\nthat they have?\n\n00:11:13.831 --> 00:11:15.988\nNot directing --\n\n00:11:16.012 --> 00:11:18.602\nnot even empowering --\n\n00:11:18.626 --> 00:11:20.855\nbut just fueling their initiative.\n\n00:11:21.958 --> 00:11:23.315\nJust north of here,\n\n00:11:23.339 --> 00:11:26.506\nwe have an example\nof what this could look like:\n\n00:11:26.530 --> 00:11:27.780\nSilicon

What? What do men have to do with gender equality? Gender equality is about women, right? I mean, the word gender is about women. Actually, I'm even here speaking as a middle class white man.Now, I wasn't always a middle class white man. It all happened for me about 30 years ago when I was in graduate school, and a bunch of us graduate students got together one day, and we said, you know, there's an explosion of writing and thinking in feminist theory, but there's no courses yet. So we did what graduate students typically do in a situation like that. We said, OK, let's have a study group. We'll read a text, we'll talk about it, we'll have a potluck dinner.(Laughter)So every week, 11 women and me got together.(Laughter)We would read some text in feminist theory and have a conversation about it. And during one of our conversations, I witnessed an interaction that changed my life forever. It was a conversation between two women. One of the women was white, and one was black. And the white woman said \u2014 this is going to sound very anachronistic now \u2014 the white woman said, \"All women face the same oppression as women. All women are similarly situated in patriarchy, and therefore all women have a kind of intuitive solidarity or sisterhood.\" And the black woman said, \"I'm not so sure. Let me ask you a question.\" So the black woman says to the white woman, \"When you wake up in the morning and you look in the mirror, what do you see?\" And the white woman said, \"I see a woman.\" And the black woman said, \"You see, that's the problem for me. Because when I wake up in the morning and I look in the mirror,\" she said, \"I see a black woman. To me, race is visible. But to you, race is invisible. You don't see it.\" And then she said something really startling. She said, \"That's how privilege works. Privilege is invisible to those who have it.\" It is a luxury, I will say to the white people sitting in this room, not to have to think about race every split second of our lives. Privilege is invisible to those who have it.Now remember, I was the only man in this group, so when I witnessed this, I went, \"Oh no.\"(Laughter)And somebody said, \"Well what was that reaction?\" And I said, \"Well, when I wake up in the morning and I look in the mirror, I see a human being. I'm kind of the generic person. You know, I'm a middle class white man. I have no race, no class, no gender. I'm universally generalizable.\"(Laughter)So I like to think that was the moment I became a middle class white man, that class and race and gender were not about other people, they were about me. I had to start thinking about them, and it had been privilege that had kept it invisible to me for so long.Now, I wish I could tell you this story ends 30 years ago in that little discussion group, but I was reminded of it quite recently at my university where I teach. I have a colleague, and she and I both teach the sociology of gender course on alternate semesters. So she gives a guest lecture for me when I teach. I give a guest lecture for her when she teaches. So I walk into her class to give a guest lecture, about 300 students in the room, and as I walk in, one of the students looks up and says, \"Oh, finally, an objective opinion.\"All that semester, whenever my colleague opened her mouth, what my students saw was a woman. I mean, if you were to say to my students, \"There is structural inequality based on gender in the United States,\" they'd say, \"Well of course you'd say that. You're a woman. You're biased.\" When I say it, they go, \"Wow, is that interesting. Is that going to be on the test? How do you spell 'structural'?\"(Laughter)So I hope you all can see, this is what objectivity looks like.(Laughter) (Applause)Disembodied Western rationality.(Laughter)And that, by the way, is why I think men so often wear ties.(Laughter)Because if you are going to embody disembodied Western rationality, you need a signifier, and what could be a better signifier of disembodied Western rationality than a garment that at one end is a noose and the other end points to the genitals?(Laughter) (Applause)That is mind-body dualism right there.So making gender visible to men is the first step to engaging men to support gender equality.Now, when men first hear about gender equality, when they first start thinking about it, they often think, many men think, well, that's right, that's fair, that's just, that's the ethical imperative. But not all men. Some men think \u2014 the lightning bolt goes off, and they go, \"Oh my God, yes, gender equality,\" and they will immediately begin to mansplain to you your oppression. They see supporting gender equality something akin to the cavalry, like, \"Thanks very much for bringing this to our attention, ladies, we'll take it from here.\" This results in a syndrome that I like to call 'premature self-congratulation.'(Laughter) (Applause)There's another group, though, that actively resists gender equality, that sees gender equality as something that is detrimental to men. I was on a TV talk show opposite four white men. This is the beginning of the book I wrote, 'Angry White Men.' These were four angry white men who believed that they, white men in America, were the victims of reverse discrimination in the workplace. And they all told stories about how they were qualified for jobs, qualified for promotions, they didn't get them, they were really angry. And the reason I'm telling you this is I want you to hear the title of this particular show. It was a quote from one of the men, and the quote was, \"A Black Woman Stole My Job.\" And they all told their stories, qualified for jobs, qualified for promotions, didn't get it, really angry. And then it was my turn to speak, and I said, \"I have just one question for you guys, and it's about the title of the show, 'A Black Woman Stole My Job.' Actually, it's about one word in the title. I want to know about the word 'my.' Where did you get the idea it was your job? Why isn't the title of the show, 'A Black Woman Got the Job?' or 'A Black Woman Got A Job?'\" Because without confronting men's sense of entitlement, I don't think we'll ever understand why so many men resist gender equality.(Applause)Look, we think this is a level playing field, so any policy that tilts it even a little bit, we think, \"Oh my God, water's rushing uphill. It's reverse discrimination against us.\"(Laughter)So let me be very clear: white men in Europe and the United States are the beneficiaries of the single greatest affirmative action program in the history of the world. It is called \"the history of the world.\"(Laughter) (Applause)So, now I've established some of the obstacles to engaging men, but why should we support gender equality? Of course, it's fair, it's right and it's just. But more than that, gender equality is also in our interest as men. If you listen to what men say about what they want in their lives, gender equality is actually a way for us to get the lives we want to live.Gender equality is good for countries. It turns out, according to most studies, that those countries that are the most gender equal are also the countries that score highest on the happiness scale. And that's not just because they're all in Europe.(Laughter)Even within Europe, those countries that are more gender equal also have the highest levels of happiness.It is also good for companies. Research by Catalyst and others has shown conclusively that the more gender-equal companies are, the better it is for workers, the happier their labor force is. They have lower job turnover. They have lower levels of attrition. They have an easier time recruiting. They have higher rates of retention, higher job satisfaction, higher rates of productivity. So the question I'm often asked in companies is, \"Boy, this gender equality thing, that's really going to be expensive, huh?\" And I say, \"Oh no, in fact, what you have to start calculating is how much gender inequality is already costing you. It is extremely expensive.\" So it is good for business.And the other thing is, it's good for men. It is good for the kind of lives we want to live, because young men especially have changed enormously, and they want to have lives that are animated by terrific relationships with their children. They expect their partners, their spouses, their wives, to work outside the home and be just as committed to their careers as they are.I was talking, to give you an illustration of this change \u2014 Some of you may remember this. When I was a lot younger, there was a riddle that was posed to us. Some of you may wince to remember this riddle. This riddle went something like this.A man and his son are driving on the freeway, and they're in a terrible accident, and the father is killed, and the son is brought to the hospital emergency room, and as they're bringing the son into the hospital emergency room, the emergency room attending physician sees the boy and says, \"Oh, I can't treat him, that's my son.\" How is this possible?We were flummoxed by this. We could not figure this out.(Laughter)Well, I decided to do a little experiment with my 16-year old son. He had a bunch of his friends hanging out at the house watching a game on TV recently. So I decided I would pose this riddle to them, just to see, to gauge the level of change. Well, 16-year-old boys, they immediately turned to me and said, \"It's his mom.\" Right? No problem. Just like that. Except for my son, who said, \"Well, he could have two dads.\"(Laughter) (Applause)That's an index, an indicator of how things have changed. Younger men today expect to be able to balance work and family. They want to be dual-career, dual-carer couples. They want to be able to balance work and family with their partners. They want to be involved fathers.Now, it turns out that the more egalitarian our relationships, the happier both partners are. Data from psychologists and sociologists are quite persuasive here. I think we have the persuasive numbers, the data, to prove to men that gender equality is not a zero-sum game, but a win-win. Here's what the data show. Now, when men begin the process of engaging with balancing work and family, we often have two phrases that we use to describe what we do. We pitch in and we help out.(Laughter)And I'm going to propose something a little bit more radical, one word: \"share.\"(Laughter)Because here's what the data show: when men share housework and childcare, their children do better in school. Their children have lower rates of absenteeism, higher rates of achievement. They are less likely to be diagnosed with ADHD. They are less likely to see a child psychiatrist. They are less likely to be put on medication.So when men share housework and childcare, their children are happier and healthier, and men want this.When men share housework and childcare, their wives are happier. Duh. Not only that, their wives are healthier. Their wives are less likely to see a therapist, less likely to be diagnosed with depression, less likely to be put on medication, more likely to go to the gym, report higher levels of marital satisfaction. So when men share housework and childcare, their wives are happier and healthier, and men certainly want this as well. When men share housework and childcare, the men are healthier. They smoke less, drink less, take recreational drugs less often. They are less likely to go to the ER but more like to go to a doctor for routine screenings. They are less likely to see a therapist, less likely to be diagnosed with depression, less likely to be taking prescription medication. So when men share housework and childcare, the men are happier and healthier. And who wouldn't want that?And finally, when men share housework and childcare, they have more sex.(Laughter)Now, of these four fascinating findings, which one do you think Men's Health magazine put on its cover?(Laughter)\"Housework Makes Her Horny. (Not When She Does It.)\"(Laughter)Now, I will say, just to remind the men in the audience, these data were collected over a really long period of time, so I don't want listeners to say, \"Hmm, OK, I think I'll do the dishes tonight.\" These data were collected over a really long period of time. But I think it shows something important, that when Men's Health magazine put it on their cover, they also called, you'll love this, \"Choreplay.\"So, what we found is something really important, that gender equality is in the interest of countries, of companies, and of men, and their children and their partners, that gender equality is not a zero-sum game. It's not a win-lose. It is a win-win for everyone. And what we also know is we cannot fully empower women and girls unless we engage boys and men. We know this. And my position is that men need the very things that women have identified that they need to live the lives they say they want to live in order to live the lives that we say we want to live.In 1915, on the eve of one of the great suffrage demonstrations down Fifth Avenue in New York City, a writer in New York wrote an article in a magazine, and the title of the article was, \"Feminism for Men.\" And this was the first line of that article: \"Feminism will make it possible for the first time for men to be free.\"Thank you.(Applause)", "id": 2329, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:12.838 --> 00:00:16.414\nI'm here to recruit men\nto support gender equality.\n\n00:00:16.438 --> 00:00:19.574\n(Cheers)\n\n00:00:19.598 --> 00:00:21.238\nWait, wait.

You don't see it.\"\n\n00:02:19.718 --> 00:02:22.413\nAnd then she said\nsomething really startling.\n\n00:02:22.437 --> 00:02:24.278\nShe said, \"That's how privilege works.\n\n00:02:25.118 --> 00:02:27.878\nPrivilege is invisible\nto those who have it.\"\n\n00:02:28.638 --> 00:02:31.894\nIt is a luxury, I will say\nto the white people sitting in this room,\n\n00:02:31.918 --> 00:02:35.654\nnot to have to think about race\nevery split second of our lives.\n\n00:02:35.678 --> 00:02:38.518\nPrivilege is invisible\nto those who have it.\n\n00:02:39.438 --> 00:02:41.629\nNow remember, I was\nthe only man in this group,\n\n00:02:41.838 --> 00:02:44.734\nso when I witnessed this, I went, \"Oh no.\"\n\n00:02:44.758 --> 00:02:46.494\n(Laughter)\n\n00:02:46.518 --> 00:02:48.854\nAnd somebody said,\n\"Well what was that reaction?\"\n\n00:02:48.878 --> 00:02:52.534\nAnd I said, \"Well, when I wake up\nin the morning and I look in the mirror,\n\n00:02:52.558 --> 00:02:54.454\nI see a human being.\n\n00:02:54.478 --> 00:02:56.934\nI'm kind of the generic person.\n\n00:02:56.958 --> 00:03:00.974\nYou know, I'm a middle class white man.\nI have no race, no class, no gender.\n\n00:03:00.998 --> 00:03:03.014\nI'm universally generalizable.\"\n\n00:03:03.038 --> 00:03:04.854\n(Laughter)\n\n00:03:04.878 --> 00:03:08.614\nSo I like to think that was the moment\nI became a middle class white man,\n\n00:03:08.638 --> 00:03:12.574\nthat class and race and gender\nwere not about other people,\n\n00:03:12.598 --> 00:03:14.134\nthey were about me.\n\n00:03:14.158 --> 00:03:16.334\nI had to start thinking about them,\n\n00:03:16.358 --> 00:03:20.358\nand it had been privilege that had\nkept it invisible to me for so long.\n\n00:03:21.158 --> 00:03:23.825\nNow, I wish I could tell you\nthis story ends 30 years ago\n\n00:03:23.849 --> 00:03:25.414\nin that little discussion group,\n\n00:03:25.438 --> 00:03:29.214\nbut I was reminded of it quite recently\nat my university where I teach.\n\n00:03:29.238 --> 00:03:33.174\nI have a colleague, and she and I\nboth teach the sociology of gender course\n\n00:03:33.198 --> 00:03:35.054\non alternate semesters.\n\n00:03:35.078 --> 00:03:37.454\nSo she gives a guest lecture\nfor me when I teach.\n\n00:03:37.478 --> 00:03:39.854\nI give a guest lecture\nfor her when she teaches.\n\n00:03:39.878 --> 00:03:43.214\nSo I walk into her class\nto give a guest lecture,\n\n00:03:43.238 --> 00:03:45.414\nabout 300 students in the room,\n\n00:03:45.438 --> 00:03:48.774\nand as I walk in, one of the students\nlooks up and says,\n\n00:03:48.798 --> 00:03:51.158\n\"Oh, finally, an objective opinion.\"\n\n00:03:52.798 --> 00:03:55.934\nAll that semester, whenever\nmy colleague opened her mouth,\n\n00:03:55.958 --> 00:03:58.334\nwhat my students saw was a woman.\n\n00:03:58.358 --> 00:04:00.454\nI mean, if you were to say to my students,\n\n00:04:00.478 --> 00:04:03.934\n\"There is structural inequality\nbased on gender in the United States,\"\n\n00:04:03.958 --> 00:04:05.974\nthey'd say, \"Well of course\nyou'd say that.\n\n00:04:05.998 --> 00:04:07.475\nYou're a woman. You're biased.\"\n\n00:04:07.499 --> 00:04:10.374\nWhen I say it, they go,\n\"Wow, is that interesting.\n\n00:04:10.398 --> 00:04:13.398\nIs that going to be on the test?\nHow do you spell 'structural'?\"\n\n00:04:13.422 --> 00:04:15.254\n(Laughter)\n\n00:04:15.278 --> 00:04:17.534\nSo I hope you all can see,\n\n00:04:17.558 --> 00:04:20.414\nthis is what objectivity looks like.\n\n00:04:20.438 --> 00:04:24.174\n(Laughter) (Applause)\n\n00:04:24.198 --> 00:04:27.454\nDisembodied Western rationality.\n\n00:04:27.478 --> 00:04:30.213\n(Laughter)\n\n00:04:30.237 --> 00:04:33.718\nAnd that, by the way, is why I think\nmen so often wear ties.\n\n00:04:34.318 --> 00:04:36.014\n(Laughter)\n\n00:04:36.038 --> 00:04:40.614\nBecause if you are going to embody\ndisembodied Western rationality,\n\n00:04:40.638 --> 00:04:42.134\nyou need a signifier,\n\n00:04:42.158 --> 00:04:46.374\nand what could be a better signifier\nof disembodied Western rationality\n\n00:04:46.398 --> 00:04:50.814\nthan a garment that at one end is a noose\nand the other end points to the genitals?\n\n00:04:50.838 --> 00:04:55.598\n(Laughter) (Applause)\n\n00:04:57.598 --> 00:05:01.478\nThat is mind-body dualism right there.\n\n00:05:03.998 --> 00:05:08.134\nSo making gender visible to men\n\n00:05:08.158 --> 00:05:12.974\nis the first step to engaging men\nto support gender equality.\n\n00:05:12.998 --> 00:05:15.334\nNow, when men first hear\nabout gender equality,\n\n00:05:15.358 --> 00:05:17.263\nwhen they first start thinking about it,\n\n00:05:17.287 --> 00:05:19.774\nthey often think, many men think,\n\n00:05:19.798 --> 00:05:24.054\nwell, that's right,\nthat's fair, that's just,\n\n00:05:24.078 --> 00:05:26.078\nthat's the ethical imperative.\n\n00:05:27.078 --> 00:05:28.654\nBut not all men.\n\n00:05:28.678 --> 00:05:31.374\nSome men think --\nthe lightning bolt goes off,\n\n00:05:31.398 --> 00:05:34.214\nand they go, \"Oh my God,\nyes, gender equality,\"\n\n00:05:34.238 --> 00:05:37.958\nand they will immediately begin\nto mansplain to you your oppression.\n\n00:05:39.918 --> 00:05:44.534\nThey see supporting gender equality\nsomething akin to the cavalry,\n\n00:05:44.558 --> 00:05:47.701\nlike, \"Thanks very much for bringing this\nto our attention, ladies,\n\n00:05:47.725 --> 00:05:48.925\nwe'll take it from here.\"\n\n00:05:49.278 --> 00:05:53.694\nThis results in a syndrome that I like\nto call 'premature self-congratulation.'\n\n00:05:53.718 --> 00:05:58.014\n(Laughter) (Applause)\n\n00:05:58.038 --> 00:06:02.134\nThere's another group, though,\nthat actively resists gender equality,\n\n00:06:02.158 --> 00:06:07.854\nthat sees gender equality\nas something that is detrimental to men.\n\n00:06:07.878 --> 00:06:11.694\nI was on a TV talk show\nopposite four white men.\n\n00:06:11.718 --> 00:06:14.894\nThis is the beginning of the book\nI wrote, 'Angry White Men.'\n\n00:06:14.918 --> 00:06:16.614\nThese were four angry white men\n\n00:06:16.638 --> 00:06:20.494\nwho believed that they,\nwhite men in America,\n\n00:06:20.518 --> 00:06:24.998\nwere the victims of reverse discrimination\nin the workplace.\n\n00:06:25.798 --> 00:06:28.854\nAnd they all told stories\nabout how they were qualified for jobs,\n\n00:06:28.878 --> 00:06:30.094\nqualified for promotions,\n\n00:06:30.118 --> 00:06:32.374\nthey didn't get them,\nthey were really angry.\n\n00:06:32.398 --> 00:06:35.574\nAnd the reason I'm telling you this\nis I want you to hear the title\n\n00:06:35.598 --> 00:06:37.254\nof this particular show.\n\n00:06:37.278 --> 00:06:39.414\nIt was a quote from one of the men,\n\n00:06:39.438 --> 00:06:40.854\nand the quote was,\n\n00:06:40.878 --> 00:06:43.078\n\"A Black Woman Stole My Job.\"\n\n00:06:44.318 --> 00:06:45.894\nAnd they all told their stories,\n\n00:06:45.918 --> 00:06:48.054\nqualified for jobs,\nqualified for promotions,\n\n00:06:48.078 --> 00:06:49.414\ndidn't get it, really angry.\n\n00:06:49.438 --> 00:06:51.214\nAnd then it was my turn to speak,\n\n00:06:51.238 --> 00:06:53.814\nand I said, \"I have\njust one question for you guys,\n\n00:06:53.838 --> 00:06:56.454\nand it's about the title of the show,\n\n00:06:56.478 --> 00:06:58.334\n'A Black Woman Stole My Job.'\n\n00:06:58.358 --> 00:07:01.254\nActually, it's about\none word in the title.\n\n00:07:01.278 --> 00:07:03.814\nI want to know about the word 'my.'\n\n00:07:03.838 --> 00:07:06.518\nWhere did you get the idea\nit was your job?\n\n00:07:07.238 --> 00:07:10.534\nWhy isn't the title of the show,\n'A Black Woman Got the Job?'\n\n00:07:10.558 --> 00:07:13.014\nor 'A Black Woman Got A Job?'\"\n\n00:07:13.038 --> 00:07:16.174\nBecause without confronting\nmen's sense of entitlement,\n\n00:07:16.198 --> 00:07:20.494\nI don't think we'll ever understand\nwhy so many men resist gender equality.\n\n00:07:20.518 --> 00:07:26.934\n(Applause)\n\n00:07:26.958 --> 00:07:30.294\nLook, we think this\nis a level playing field,\n\n00:07:30.318 --> 00:07:32.494\nso any policy that tilts it\neven a little bit,\n\n00:07:32.518 --> 00:07:34.654\nwe think, \"Oh my God,\nwater's rushing uphill.\n\n00:07:34.678 --> 00:07:36.583\nIt's reverse discrimination against us.\"\n\n00:07:36.607 --> 00:07:37.814\n(Laughter)\n\n00:07:37.838 --> 00:07:39.238\nSo let me be very clear:\n\n00:07:39.838 --> 00:07:42.854\nwhite men in Europe and the United States\n\n00:07:42.878 --> 00:07:46.894\nare the beneficiaries of the single\ngreatest affirmative action program\n\n00:07:46.918 --> 00:07:48.454\nin the history of the world.\n\n00:07:48.478 --> 00:07:50.534\nIt is called \"the history of the world.\"\n\n00:07:50.558 --> 00:07:55.238\n(Laughter) (Applause)\n\n00:07:56.718 --> 00:08:00.934\nSo, now I've established\nsome of the obstacles to engaging men,\n\n00:08:00.958 --> 00:08:03.574\nbut why should we support gender equality?\n\n00:08:03.598 --> 00:08:07.054\nOf course, it's fair,\nit's right and it's just.\n\n00:08:07.078 --> 00:08:08.534\nBut more than that,\n\n00:08:08.558 --> 00:08:12.638\ngender equality is also\nin our interest as men.\n\n00:08:13.478 --> 00:08:18.334\nIf you listen to what men say\nabout what they want in their lives,\n\n00:08:18.358 --> 00:08:23.894\ngender equality is actually a way\nfor us to get the lives we want to live.\n\n00:08:23.918 --> 00:08:27.454\nGender equality is good for countries.\n\n00:08:27.478 --> 00:08:31.534\nIt turns out, according to most studies,\n\n00:08:31.558 --> 00:08:34.534\nthat those countries\nthat are the most gender equal\n\n00:08:34.558 --> 00:08:39.094\nare also the countries that score highest\non the happiness scale.\n\n00:08:39.118 --> 00:08:41.494\nAnd that's not just because\nthey're all in Europe.\n\n00:08:41.518 --> 00:08:42.734\n(Laughter)\n\n00:08:42.758 --> 00:08:46.493\nEven within Europe, those countries\nthat are more gender equal\n\n00:08:46.517 --> 00:08:49.117\nalso have the highest levels of happiness.\n\n00:08:50.278 --> 00:08:51.958\nIt is also good for companies.\n\n00:08:52.838 --> 00:08:56.414\nResearch by Catalyst and others\nhas shown conclusively\n\n00:08:56.438 --> 00:09:00.054\nthat the more gender-equal companies are,\n\n00:09:00.078 --> 00:09:04.294\nthe better it is for workers,\n\n00:09:04.318 --> 00:09:06.134\nthe happier their labor force is.\n\n00:09:06.158 --> 00:09:10.014\nThey have lower job turnover.\nThey have lower levels of attrition.\n\n00:09:10.038 --> 00:09:12.374\nThey have an easier time recruiting.\n\n00:09:12.398 --> 00:09:15.334\nThey have higher rates of retention,\nhigher job satisfaction,\n\n00:09:15.358 --> 00:09:17.574\nhigher rates of productivity.\n\n00:09:17.598 --> 00:09:20.454\nSo the question I'm often asked\nin companies is,\n\n00:09:20.478 --> 00:09:24.050\n\"Boy, this gender equality thing,\nthat's really going to be expensive, huh?\"\n\n00:09:24.074 --> 00:09:28.294\nAnd I say, \"Oh no, in fact,\nwhat you have to start calculating\n\n00:09:28.318 --> 00:09:32.294\nis how much gender inequality\nis already costing you.\n\n00:09:32.318 --> 00:09:34.238\nIt is extremely expensive.\"\n\n00:09:34.838 --> 00:09:36.558\nSo it is good for business.\n\n00:09:37.598 --> 00:09:40.238\nAnd the other thing is, it's good for men.\n\n00:09:40.998 --> 00:09:43.974\nIt is good for the kind of lives\nwe want to live,\n\n00:09:43.998 --> 00:09:47.934\nbecause young men especially\nhave changed enormously,\n\n00:09:47.958 --> 00:09:51.134\nand they want to have lives\nthat are animated\n\n00:09:51.158 --> 00:09:53.894\nby terrific relationships\nwith their children.\n\n00:09:53.918 --> 00:09:57.654\nThey expect their partners,\ntheir spouses, their wives,\n\n00:09:57.678 --> 00:09:58.854\nto work outside the home\n\n00:09:58.878 --> 00:10:02.374\nand be just as committed\nto their careers as they are.\n\n00:10:02.398 --> 00:10:06.214\nI was talking, to give you\nan illustration of this change --\n\n00:10:06.238 --> 00:10:08.014\nSome of you may remember this.\n\n00:10:08.038 --> 00:10:13.134\nWhen I was a lot younger,\nthere was a riddle that was posed to us.\n\n00:10:13.158 --> 00:10:15.574\nSome of you may wince\nto remember this riddle.\n\n00:10:15.598 --> 00:10:18.174\nThis riddle went something like this.\n\n00:10:18.198 --> 00:10:21.534\nA man and his son\nare driving on the freeway,\n\n00:10:21.558 --> 00:10:23.534\nand they're in a terrible accident,\n\n00:10:23.558 --> 00:10:25.814\nand the father is killed,\n\n00:10:25.838 --> 00:10:28.894\nand the son is brought\nto the hospital emergency room,\n\n00:10:28.918 --> 00:10:31.974\nand as they're bringing the son\ninto the hospital emergency room,\n\n00:10:31.998 --> 00:10:35.614\nthe emergency room attending physician\nsees the boy and says,\n\n00:10:35.638 --> 00:10:37.974\n\"Oh, I can't treat him, that's my son.\"\n\n00:10:37.998 --> 00:10:39.358\nHow is this possible?\n\n00:10:40.118 --> 00:10:42.414\nWe were flummoxed by this.\n\n00:10:42.438 --> 00:10:44.614\nWe could not figure this out.\n\n00:10:44.638 --> 00:10:46.574\n(Laughter)\n\n00:10:46.598 --> 00:10:49.734\nWell, I decided to do a little experiment\nwith my 16-year old son.\n\n00:10:49.758 --> 00:10:53.214\nHe had a bunch of his friends\nhanging out at the house\n\n00:10:53.238 --> 00:10:55.534\nwatching a game on TV recently.\n\n00:10:55.558 --> 00:10:57.774\nSo I decided I would pose\nthis riddle to them,\n\n00:10:57.798 --> 00:11:00.774\njust to see, to gauge the level of change.\n\n00:11:00.798 --> 00:11:02.854\nWell, 16-year-old boys,\n\n00:11:02.878 --> 00:11:06.894\nthey immediately turned to me\nand said, \"It's his mom.\" Right?\n\n00:11:06.918 --> 00:11:08.694\nNo problem. Just like that.\n\n00:11:08.718 --> 00:11:11.574\nExcept for my son, who said,\n\"Well, he could have two dads.\"\n\n00:11:11.598 --> 00:11:17.094\n(Laughter) (Applause)\n\n00:11:17.118 --> 00:11:20.934\nThat's an index, an indicator\nof how things have changed.\n\n00:11:20.958 --> 00:11:26.774\nYounger men today expect\nto be able to balance work and family.\n\n00:11:26.798 --> 00:11:32.094\nThey want to be dual-career,\ndual-carer couples.\n\n00:11:32.118 --> 00:11:35.814\nThey want to be able to balance\nwork and family with their partners.\n\n00:11:35.838 --> 00:11:37.734\nThey want to be involved fathers.\n\n00:11:37.758 --> 00:11:39.894\nNow, it turns out\n\n00:11:39.918 --> 00:11:43.294\nthat the more egalitarian\nour relationships,\n\n00:11:43.318 --> 00:11:46.118\nthe happier both partners are.\n\n00:11:46.918 --> 00:11:50.854\nData from psychologists and sociologists\nare quite persuasive here.\n\n00:11:50.878 --> 00:11:56.534\nI think we have the persuasive numbers,\nthe data, to prove to men\n\n00:11:56.558 --> 00:12:00.734\nthat gender equality\nis not a zero-sum game, but a win-win.\n\n00:12:00.758 --> 00:12:02.534\nHere's what the data show.\n\n00:12:02.558 --> 00:12:08.094\nNow, when men begin\nthe process of engaging\n\n00:12:08.118 --> 00:12:09.894\nwith balancing work and family,\n\n00:12:09.918 --> 00:12:13.094\nwe often have two phrases\nthat we use to describe what we do.\n\n00:12:13.118 --> 00:12:15.654\nWe pitch in and we help out.\n\n00:12:15.678 --> 00:12:16.894\n(Laughter)\n\n00:12:16.918 --> 00:12:19.814\nAnd I'm going to propose\nsomething a little bit more radical,\n\n00:12:19.838 --> 00:12:21.054\none word: \"share.\"\n\n00:12:21.078 --> 00:12:22.814\n(Laughter)\n\n00:12:22.838 --> 00:12:24.494\nBecause here's what the data show:\n\n00:12:24.518 --> 00:12:26.814\nwhen men share housework and childcare,\n\n00:12:26.838 --> 00:12:28.918\ntheir children do better in school.\n\n00:12:29.558 --> 00:12:32.174\nTheir children have lower rates\nof absenteeism,\n\n00:12:32.198 --> 00:12:33.734\nhigher rates of achievement.\n\n00:12:33.758 --> 00:12:36.494\nThey are less likely\nto be diagnosed with ADHD.\n\n00:12:36.518 --> 00:12:39.374\nThey are less likely\nto see a child psychiatrist.\n\n00:12:39.398 --> 00:12:41.518\nThey are less likely\nto be put on medication.\n\n00:12:42.038 --> 00:12:44.878\nSo when men share housework and childcare,\n\n00:12:45.878 --> 00:12:48.654\ntheir children are happier and healthier,\n\n00:12:48.678 --> 00:12:50.358\nand men want this.\n\n00:12:51.478 --> 00:12:53.894\nWhen men share housework and childcare,\n\n00:12:53.918 --> 00:12:56.558\ntheir wives are happier.

--> 00:14:31.894\nthat when Men's Health magazine\nput it on their cover,\n\n00:14:31.918 --> 00:14:34.157\nthey also called,\nyou'll love this, \"Choreplay.\"\n\n00:14:35.398 --> 00:14:40.174\nSo, what we found\nis something really important,\n\n00:14:40.198 --> 00:14:42.294\nthat gender equality\n\n00:14:42.318 --> 00:14:45.374\nis in the interest of countries,\n\n00:14:45.398 --> 00:14:48.534\nof companies, and of men,\n\n00:14:48.558 --> 00:14:51.094\nand their children and their partners,\n\n00:14:51.118 --> 00:14:53.574\nthat gender equality\nis not a zero-sum game.\n\n00:14:53.598 --> 00:14:54.854\nIt's not a win-lose.\n\n00:14:54.878 --> 00:14:58.094\nIt is a win-win for everyone.\n\n00:14:58.118 --> 00:15:00.374\nAnd what we also know\n\n00:15:00.398 --> 00:15:03.974\nis we cannot fully empower women and girls\n\n00:15:03.998 --> 00:15:06.654\nunless we engage boys and men.\n\n00:15:06.678 --> 00:15:07.878\nWe know this.\n\n00:15:09.278 --> 00:15:10.734\nAnd my position is\n\n00:15:10.758 --> 00:15:14.974\nthat men need the very things\nthat women have identified\n\n00:15:14.998 --> 00:15:18.054\nthat they need to live the lives\nthey

"Falling in love is the easy part", "duration": "833", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/mandy_len_catron_falling_in_love_is_the_easy_part", "transcript": "I published this article in the New York Times Modern Love column in January of this year. \"To Fall in Love With Anyone, Do This.\" And the article is about a psychological study designed to create romantic love in the laboratory, and my own experience trying the study myself one night last summer.So the procedure is fairly simple: two strangers take turns asking each other 36 increasingly personal questions and then they stare into each other's eyes without speaking for four minutes.So here are a couple of sample questions.Number 12: If you could wake up tomorrow having gained any one quality or ability, what would it be?Number 28: When did you last cry in front of another person? By yourself?As you can see, they really do get more personal as they go along.Number 30, I really like this one: Tell your partner what you like about them; be very honest this time, saying things you might not say to someone you just met.So when I first came across this study a few years earlier, one detail really stuck out to me, and that was the rumor that two of the participants had gotten married six months later, and they'd invited the entire lab to the ceremony. So I was of course very skeptical about this process of just manufacturing romantic love, but of course I was intrigued. And when I got the chance to try this study myself, with someone I knew but not particularly well, I wasn't expecting to fall in love. But then we did, and \u2014(Laughter)And I thought it made a good story, so I sent it to the Modern Love column a few months later.Now, this was published in January, and now it is August, so I'm guessing that some of you are probably wondering, are we still together? And the reason I think you might be wondering this is because I have been asked this question again and again and again for the past seven months. And this question is really what I want to talk about today. But let's come back to it.(Laughter)So the week before the article came out, I was very nervous. I had been working on a book about love stories for the past few years, so I had gotten used to writing about my own experiences with romantic love on my blog. But a blog post might get a couple hundred views at the most, and those were usually just my Facebook friends, and I figured my article in the New York Times would probably get a few thousand views. And that felt like a lot of attention on a relatively new relationship. But as it turned out, I had no idea.So the article was published online on a Friday evening, and by Saturday, this had happened to the traffic on my blog. And by Sunday, both the Today Show and Good Morning America had called. Within a month, the article would receive over 8 million views, and I was, to say the least, underprepared for this sort of attention. It's one thing to work up the confidence to write honestly about your experiences with love, but it is another thing to discover that your love life has made international news \u2014(Laughter)and to realize that people across the world are genuinely invested in the status of your new relationship.(Laughter)And when people called or emailed, which they did every day for weeks, they always asked the same question first: are you guys still together? In fact, as I was preparing this talk, I did a quick search of my email inbox for the phrase \"Are you still together?\" and several messages popped up immediately. They were from students and journalists and friendly strangers like this one. I did radio interviews and they asked. I even gave a talk, and one woman shouted up to the stage, \"Hey Mandy, where's your boyfriend?\" And I promptly turned bright red.I understand that this is part of the deal. If you write about your relationship in an international newspaper, you should expect people to feel comfortable asking about it. But I just wasn't prepared for the scope of the response. The 36 questions seem to have taken on a life of their own. In fact, the New York Times published a follow-up article for Valentine's Day, which featured readers' experiences of trying the study themselves, with varying degrees of success.So my first impulse in the face of all of this attention was to become very protective of my own relationship. I said no to every request for the two of us to do a media appearance together. I turned down TV interviews, and I said no to every request for photos of the two us. I think I was afraid that we would become inadvertent icons for the process of falling in love, a position I did not at all feel qualified for.And I get it: people didn't just want to know if the study worked, they wanted to know if it really worked: that is, if it was capable of producing love that would last, not just a fling, but real love, sustainable love.But this was a question I didn't feel capable of answering. My own relationship was only a few months old, and I felt like people were asking the wrong question in the first place. What would knowing whether or not we were still together really tell them? If the answer was no, would it make the experience of doing these 36 questions any less worthwhile? Dr. Arthur Aron first wrote about these questions in this study here in 1997, and here, the researcher's goal was not to produce romantic love. Instead, they wanted to foster interpersonal closeness among college students, by using what Aron called \"sustained, escalating, reciprocal, personalistic self-disclosure.\" Sounds romantic, doesn't it? But the study did work. The participants did feel closer after doing it, and several subsequent studies have also used Aron's fast friends protocol as a way to quickly create trust and intimacy between strangers. They've used it between members of the police and members of community, and they've used it between people of opposing political ideologies. The original version of the story, the one that I tried last summer, that pairs the personal questions with four minutes of eye contact, was referenced in this article, but unfortunately it was never published.So a few months ago, I was giving a talk at a small liberal arts college, and a student came up to me afterwards and he said, kind of shyly, \"So, I tried your study, and it didn't work.\" He seemed a little mystified by this. \"You mean, you didn't fall in love with the person you did it with?\" I asked.\"Well...\" He paused. \"I think she just wants to be friends.\"\"But did you become better friends?\" I asked. \"Did you feel like you got to really know each other after doing the study?\" He nodded.\"So, then it worked,\" I said.I don't think this is the answer he was looking for. In fact, I don't think this is the answer that any of us are looking for when it comes to love.I first came across this study when I was 29 and I was going through a really difficult breakup. I had been in the relationship since I was 20, which was basically my entire adult life, and he was my first real love, and I had no idea how or if I could make a life without him. So I turned to science. I researched everything I could find about the science of romantic love, and I think I was hoping that it might somehow inoculate me from heartache. I don't know if I realized this at the time \u2014 I thought I was just doing research for this book I was writing \u2014 but it seems really obvious in retrospect. I hoped that if I armed myself with the knowledge of romantic love, I might never have to feel as terrible and lonely as I did then. And all this knowledge has been useful in some ways. I am more patient with love. I am more relaxed. I am more confident about asking for what I want. But I can also see myself more clearly, and I can see that what I want is sometimes more than can reasonably be asked for. What I want from love is a guarantee, not just that I am loved today and that I will be loved tomorrow, but that I will continue to be loved by the person I love indefinitely. Maybe it's this possibility of a guarantee that people were really asking about when they wanted to know if we were still together.So the story that the media told about the 36 questions was that there might be a shortcut to falling in love. There might be a way to somehow mitigate some of the risk involved, and this is a very appealing story, because falling in love feels amazing, but it's also terrifying. The moment you admit to loving someone, you admit to having a lot to lose, and it's true that these questions do provide a mechanism for getting to know someone quickly, which is also a mechanism for being known, and I think this is the thing that most of us really want from love: to be known, to be seen, to be understood. But I think when it comes to love, we are too willing to accept the short version of the story. The version of the story that asks, \"Are you still together?\" and is content with a yes or no answer.So rather than that question, I would propose we ask some more difficult questions, questions like: How do you decide who deserves your love and who does not? How do you stay in love when things get difficult, and how do you know when to just cut and run? How do you live with the doubt that inevitably creeps into every relationship, or even harder, how do you live with your partner's doubt? I don't necessarily know the answers to these questions, but I think they're an important start at having a more thoughtful conversation about what it means to love someone.So, if you want it, the short version of the story of my relationship is this: a year ago, an acquaintance and I did a study designed to create romantic love, and we fell in love, and we are still together, and I am so glad.But falling in love is not the same thing as staying in love. Falling in love is the easy part. So at the end of my article, I wrote, \"Love didn't happen to us. We're in love because we each made the choice to be.\" And I cringe a little when I read that now, not because it isn't true, but because at the time, I really hadn't considered everything that was contained in that choice. I didn't consider how many times we would each have to make that choice, and how many times I will continue to have to make that choice without knowing whether or not he will always choose me. I want it to be enough to have asked and answered 36 questions, and to have chosen to love someone so generous and kind and fun and to have broadcast that choice in the biggest newspaper in America. But what I have done instead is turn my relationship into the kind of myth I don't quite believe in. And what I want, what perhaps I will spend my life wanting, is for that myth to be true.I want the happy ending implied by the title to my article, which is, incidentally, the only part of the article that I didn't actually write.(Laughter)But what I have instead is the chance to make the choice to love someone, and the hope that he will choose to love me back, and it is terrifying, but that's the deal with love.Thank you.", "id": 2330, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:12.918 --> 00:00:14.374\nI published this article\n\n00:00:14.398 -->

each other\n36 increasingly personal questions\n\n00:00:41.198 --> 00:00:44.094\nand then they stare into each other's eyes\n\n00:00:44.117 --> 00:00:46.678\nwithout speaking for four minutes.\n\n00:00:47.318 --> 00:00:50.694\nSo here are a couple of sample questions.\n\n00:00:50.718 --> 00:00:55.974\nNumber 12: If you could wake up tomorrow\nhaving gained any one quality or ability,\n\n00:00:55.998 --> 00:00:57.198\nwhat would it be?\n\n00:00:58.198 --> 00:01:02.894\nNumber 28: When did you last cry\nin front of another person?\n\n00:01:02.918 --> 00:01:04.134\nBy yourself?\n\n00:01:04.158 --> 00:01:08.414\nAs you can see, they really do\nget more personal as they go along.\n\n00:01:08.438 --> 00:01:10.814\nNumber 30, I really like this one:\n\n00:01:10.838 --> 00:01:13.694\nTell your partner\nwhat you like about them;\n\n00:01:13.718 --> 00:01:15.574\nbe very honest this time,\n\n00:01:15.598 --> 00:01:19.958\nsaying things you might not say\nto someone you just met.\n\n00:01:20.798 --> 00:01:25.334\nSo when I first came across this study\na few years earlier,\n\n00:01:25.358 --> 00:01:27.454\none detail really stuck out to me,\n\n00:01:27.478 --> 00:01:30.534\nand that was the rumor\nthat two of the participants\n\n00:01:30.558 --> 00:01:33.054\nhad gotten married six months later,\n\n00:01:33.078 --> 00:01:37.254\nand they'd invited the entire lab\nto the ceremony.\n\n00:01:37.278 --> 00:01:40.134\nSo I was of course very skeptical\n\n00:01:40.158 --> 00:01:43.814\nabout this process of just\nmanufacturing romantic love,\n\n00:01:43.838 --> 00:01:46.694\nbut of course I was intrigued.\n\n00:01:46.718 --> 00:01:50.134\nAnd when I got the chance\nto try this study myself,\n\n00:01:50.158 --> 00:01:53.294\nwith someone I knew\nbut not particularly well,\n\n00:01:53.318 --> 00:01:56.454\nI wasn't expecting to fall in love.\n\n00:01:56.478 --> 00:01:59.174\nBut then we did, and --\n\n00:01:59.198 --> 00:02:01.094\n(Laughter)\n\n00:02:01.118 --> 00:02:05.494\nAnd I thought it made a good story,\nso I sent it to the Modern Love column\n\n00:02:05.518 --> 00:02:07.334\na few months later.\n\n00:02:07.358 --> 00:02:11.078\nNow, this was published in January,\n\n00:02:11.838 --> 00:02:13.534\nand now it is August,\n\n00:02:13.558 --> 00:02:17.174\nso I'm guessing that some of you\nare probably wondering,\n\n00:02:17.198 --> 00:02:19.574\nare we still together?\n\n00:02:19.598 --> 00:02:21.973\nAnd the reason I think\nyou might be wondering this\n\n00:02:21.997 --> 00:02:24.654\nis because I have been asked this question\n\n00:02:24.678 --> 00:02:28.614\nagain and again and again\nfor the past seven months.\n\n00:02:28.638 --> 00:02:32.334\nAnd this question is really\nwhat I want to talk about today.\n\n00:02:32.358 --> 00:02:33.814\nBut let's come back to it.\n\n00:02:33.838 --> 00:02:36.814\n(Laughter)\n\n00:02:36.838 --> 00:02:38.814\nSo the week before the article came out,\n\n00:02:38.838 --> 00:02:41.534\nI was very nervous.\n\n00:02:41.558 --> 00:02:44.134\nI had been working\non a book about love stories\n\n00:02:44.158 --> 00:02:45.974\nfor the past few years,\n\n00:02:45.998 --> 00:02:48.814\nso I had gotten used to writing\nabout my own experiences\n\n00:02:48.838 --> 00:02:51.854\nwith romantic love on my blog.\n\n00:02:51.878 --> 00:02:56.454\nBut a blog post might get\na couple hundred views at the most,\n\n00:02:56.478 --> 00:02:59.574\nand those were usually\njust my Facebook friends,\n\n00:02:59.598 --> 00:03:02.174\nand I figured my article\nin the New York Times\n\n00:03:02.198 --> 00:03:04.998\nwould probably get a few thousand views.\n\n00:03:06.038 --> 00:03:08.814\nAnd that felt like a lot of attention\n\n00:03:08.838 --> 00:03:12.014\non a relatively new relationship.\n\n00:03:12.038 --> 00:03:15.318\nBut as it turned out, I had no idea.\n\n00:03:16.198 --> 00:03:18.094\nSo the article was published online\n\n00:03:18.118 --> 00:03:20.174\non a Friday evening,\n\n00:03:20.198 --> 00:03:26.334\nand by Saturday, this had happened\nto the traffic on my blog.\n\n00:03:26.358 --> 00:03:31.238\nAnd by Sunday, both the Today Show\nand Good Morning America had called.\n\n00:03:32.678 --> 00:03:37.214\nWithin a month, the article\nwould receive over 8 million views,\n\n00:03:37.238 --> 00:03:39.534\nand I was, to say the least,\n\n00:03:39.558 --> 00:03:43.454\nunderprepared for this sort of attention.\n\n00:03:43.478 --> 00:03:46.454\nIt's one thing to work up\nthe confidence to write honestly\n\n00:03:46.478 --> 00:03:48.574\nabout your experiences with love,\n\n00:03:48.598 --> 00:03:51.054\nbut it is another thing to discover\n\n00:03:51.078 --> 00:03:54.054\nthat your love life\nhas made international news --\n\n00:03:54.078 --> 00:03:55.294\n(Laughter)\n\n00:03:55.318 --> 00:03:59.134\nand to realize\nthat people across the world\n\n00:03:59.158 --> 00:04:04.134\nare genuinely invested\nin the status of your new relationship.\n\n00:04:04.158 --> 00:04:06.334\n(Laughter)\n\n00:04:06.358 --> 00:04:11.174\nAnd when people called or emailed,\nwhich they did every day for weeks,\n\n00:04:11.198 --> 00:04:14.534\nthey always asked the same question first:\n\n00:04:14.558 --> 00:04:17.214\nare you guys still together?\n\n00:04:17.238 --> 00:04:19.574\nIn fact, as I was preparing this talk,\n\n00:04:19.598 --> 00:04:21.854\nI did a quick search of my email inbox\n\n00:04:21.878 --> 00:04:23.814\nfor the phrase \"Are you still together?\"\n\n00:04:23.838 --> 00:04:26.534\nand several messages\npopped up immediately.\n\n00:04:26.558 --> 00:04:29.213\nThey were from students and journalists\n\n00:04:29.237 --> 00:04:32.254\nand friendly strangers like this one.\n\n00:04:32.278 --> 00:04:34.734\nI did radio interviews and they asked.\n\n00:04:34.758 --> 00:04:38.694\nI even gave a talk, and one woman\nshouted up to the stage,\n\n00:04:38.718 --> 00:04:42.054\n\"Hey Mandy, where's your boyfriend?\"\n\n00:04:42.078 --> 00:04:45.374\nAnd I promptly turned bright red.\n\n00:04:45.398 --> 00:04:48.214\nI understand that this\nis part of the deal.\n\n00:04:48.238 --> 00:04:51.774\nIf you write about your relationship\nin an international newspaper,\n\n00:04:51.798 --> 00:04:55.454\nyou should expect people\nto feel comfortable asking about it.\n\n00:04:55.478 --> 00:05:00.414\nBut I just wasn't prepared\nfor the scope of the response.\n\n00:05:00.438 --> 00:05:04.294\nThe 36 questions seem\nto have taken on a life of their own.\n\n00:05:04.318 --> 00:05:07.734\nIn fact, the New York Times\npublished a follow-up article\n\n00:05:07.758 --> 00:05:08.974\nfor Valentine's Day,\n\n00:05:08.998 --> 00:05:13.494\nwhich featured readers' experiences\nof trying the study themselves,\n\n00:05:13.518 --> 00:05:15.798\nwith varying degrees of success.\n\n00:05:16.918 --> 00:05:21.134\nSo my first impulse\nin the face of all of this attention\n\n00:05:21.158 --> 00:05:24.598\nwas to become very protective\nof my own relationship.\n\n00:05:25.878 --> 00:05:28.894\nI said no to every request\nfor the two of us\n\n00:05:28.918 --> 00:05:31.254\nto do a media appearance together.\n\n00:05:31.278 --> 00:05:32.974\nI turned down TV interviews,\n\n00:05:32.998 --> 00:05:37.134\nand I said no to every request\nfor photos of the two us.\n\n00:05:37.158 --> 00:05:39.734\nI think I was afraid that we would become\n\n00:05:39.758 --> 00:05:43.894\ninadvertent icons\nfor the process of falling in love,\n\n00:05:43.918 --> 00:05:47.638\na position I did not at all\nfeel qualified for.\n\n00:05:48.718 --> 00:05:51.174\nAnd I get it:\n\n00:05:51.198 --> 00:05:53.974\npeople didn't just want to know\nif the study worked,\n\n00:05:53.998 --> 00:05:56.934\nthey wanted to know if it really worked:\n\n00:05:56.958 --> 00:06:01.654\nthat is, if it was capable\nof producing love that would last,\n\n00:06:01.678 --> 00:06:07.054\nnot just a fling, but real love,\nsustainable love.\n\n00:06:07.078 --> 00:06:11.174\nBut this was a question\nI didn't feel capable of answering.\n\n00:06:11.198 --> 00:06:13.894\nMy own relationship\nwas only a few months old,\n\n00:06:13.918 --> 00:06:18.678\nand I felt like people were asking\nthe wrong question in the first place.\n\n00:06:19.998 --> 00:06:24.134\nWhat would knowing whether or not\nwe were still together really tell them?\n\n00:06:24.158 --> 00:06:25.814\nIf the answer was no,\n\n00:06:25.838 --> 00:06:29.814\nwould it make the experience\nof doing these 36 questions\n\n00:06:29.838 --> 00:06:32.038\nany less worthwhile?\n\n00:06:32.758 --> 00:06:35.534\nDr. Arthur Aron first wrote\nabout these questions\n\n00:06:35.558 --> 00:06:39.934\nin this study here in 1997,\n\n00:06:39.958 --> 00:06:44.694\nand here, the researcher's goal\nwas not to produce romantic love.\n\n00:06:44.718 --> 00:06:46.654\nInstead, they wanted to foster\n\n00:06:46.678 --> 00:06:50.134\ninterpersonal closeness\namong college students,\n\n00:06:50.158 --> 00:06:52.894\nby using what Aron called\n\n00:06:52.918 --> 00:06:57.814\n\"sustained, escalating, reciprocal,\npersonalistic self-disclosure.\"\n\n00:06:57.838 --> 00:07:00.318\nSounds romantic, doesn't it?\n\n00:07:01.558 --> 00:07:03.214\nBut the study did work.\n\n00:07:03.238 --> 00:07:06.294\nThe participants\ndid feel closer after doing it,\n\n00:07:06.318 --> 00:07:11.614\nand several subsequent studies have also\nused Aron's fast friends protocol\n\n00:07:11.638 --> 00:07:15.774\nas a way to quickly create\ntrust and intimacy between strangers.\n\n00:07:15.798 --> 00:07:19.227\nThey've used it between members\nof the police and members of community,\n\n00:07:19.251 --> 00:07:22.811\nand they've used it between people\nof opposing political ideologies.\n\n00:07:23.758 --> 00:07:25.534\nThe original version of the story,\n\n00:07:25.558 --> 00:07:28.054\nthe one that I tried last summer,\n\n00:07:28.078 --> 00:07:32.294\nthat pairs the personal questions\nwith four minutes of eye contact,\n\n00:07:32.318 --> 00:07:34.414\nwas referenced in this article,\n\n00:07:34.438 --> 00:07:37.038\nbut unfortunately it was never published.\n\n00:07:38.598 --> 00:07:41.614\nSo a few months ago, I was giving a talk\n\n00:07:41.638 --> 00:07:43.934\nat a small liberal arts college,\n\n00:07:43.958 --> 00:07:46.654\nand a student came up to me afterwards\n\n00:07:46.678 --> 00:07:48.598\nand he said, kind of shyly,\n\n00:07:49.318 --> 00:07:54.334\n\"So, I tried your study,\nand it didn't work.\"\n\n00:07:54.358 --> 00:07:57.614\nHe seemed a little mystified by this.\n\n00:07:57.638 --> 00:08:02.414\n\"You mean, you didn't fall in love\nwith the person you did it with?\" I asked.\n\n00:08:02.438 --> 00:08:04.854\n\"Well...\" He paused.\n\n00:08:04.878 --> 00:08:07.358\n\"I think she just wants to be friends.\"\n\n00:08:09.438 --> 00:08:13.174\n\"But did you become\nbetter friends?\" I asked.\n\n00:08:13.198 --> 00:08:16.854\n\"Did you feel like you got to really\nknow each other after doing the study?\"\n\n00:08:16.878 --> 00:08:18.174\nHe nodded.\n\n00:08:18.198 --> 00:08:21.134\n\"So, then it worked,\" I said.\n\n00:08:21.158 --> 00:08:25.374\nI don't think this is the answer\nhe was looking for.\n\n00:08:25.398 --> 00:08:29.734\nIn fact, I don't think this is the answer\nthat any of us are looking for\n\n00:08:29.758 --> 00:08:32.014\nwhen it comes to love.\n\n00:08:32.038 --> 00:08:33.774\nI first came across this study\n\n00:08:33.798 --> 00:08:35.254\nwhen I was 29\n\n00:08:35.278 --> 00:08:38.694\nand I was going through\na really difficult breakup.\n\n00:08:38.718 --> 00:08:41.334\nI had been in the relationship\nsince I was 20,\n\n00:08:41.358 --> 00:08:44.134\nwhich was basically my entire adult life,\n\n00:08:44.158 --> 00:08:46.254\nand he was my first real love,\n\n00:08:46.278 --> 00:08:51.374\nand I had no idea how or if\nI could make a life without him.\n\n00:08:51.398 --> 00:08:53.774\nSo I turned to science.\n\n00:08:53.798 --> 00:08:58.374\nI researched everything I could find\nabout the science of romantic love,\n\n00:08:58.398 --> 00:09:03.494\nand I think I was hoping that it might\nsomehow inoculate me from heartache.\n\n00:09:03.518 --> 00:09:06.158\nI don't know if I realized\nthis at the time --\n\n00:09:07.078 --> 00:09:10.374\nI thought I was just doing research\nfor this book I was writing --\n\n00:09:10.398 --> 00:09:13.814\nbut it seems really obvious in retrospect.\n\n00:09:13.838 --> 00:09:18.254\nI hoped that if I armed myself\nwith the knowledge of romantic love,\n\n00:09:18.278 --> 00:09:22.918\nI might never have to feel\nas terrible and lonely as I did then.\n\n00:09:24.278 --> 00:09:28.574\nAnd all this knowledge\nhas been useful in some ways.\n\n00:09:28.598 --> 00:09:31.894\nI am more patient with love.\nI am more relaxed.\n\n00:09:31.918 --> 00:09:35.494\nI am more confident\nabout asking for what I want.\n\n00:09:35.518 --> 00:09:39.254\nBut I can also see myself more clearly,\n\n00:09:39.278 --> 00:09:43.534\nand I can see that what I want\nis sometimes more\n\n00:09:43.558 --> 00:09:46.614\nthan can reasonably be asked for.\n\n00:09:46.638 --> 00:09:50.094\nWhat I want from love is a guarantee,\n\n00:09:50.118 --> 00:09:52.334\nnot just that I am loved today\n\n00:09:52.358 --> 00:09:54.774\nand that I will be loved tomorrow,\n\n00:09:54.798 --> 00:09:59.998\nbut that I will continue to be loved\nby the person I love indefinitely.\n\n00:10:01.198 --> 00:10:04.694\nMaybe it's this possibility of a guarantee\n\n00:10:04.718 --> 00:10:06.694\nthat people were really asking about\n\n00:10:06.718 --> 00:10:09.438\nwhen they wanted to know\nif we were still together.\n\n00:10:10.758 --> 00:10:14.694\nSo the story that the media told\nabout the 36 questions\n\n00:10:14.718 --> 00:10:18.014\nwas that there might be\na shortcut to falling in love.\n\n00:10:18.038 --> 00:10:21.774\nThere might be a way to somehow\nmitigate some of the risk involved,\n\n00:10:21.798 --> 00:10:24.414\nand this is a very appealing story,\n\n00:10:24.438 --> 00:10:27.614\nbecause falling in love feels amazing,\n\n00:10:27.638 --> 00:10:30.374\nbut it's also terrifying.\n\n00:10:30.398 --> 00:10:32.974\nThe moment you admit to loving someone,\n\n00:10:32.998 --> 00:10:35.638\nyou admit to having a lot to lose,\n\n00:10:36.598 --> 00:10:40.814\nand it's true that these questions\ndo provide a mechanism\n\n00:10:40.838 --> 00:10:43.134\nfor getting to know someone quickly,\n\n00:10:43.158 --> 00:10:45.694\nwhich is also a mechanism for being known,\n\n00:10:45.718 --> 00:10:50.174\nand I think this is the thing\nthat most of us really want from love:\n\n00:10:50.198 --> 00:10:54.278\nto be known, to be seen, to be understood.\n\n00:10:55.158 --> 00:10:57.094\nBut I think when it comes to love,\n\n00:10:57.118 --> 00:11:01.614\nwe are too willing to accept\nthe short version of the story.\n\n00:11:01.638 --> 00:11:05.214\nThe version of the story that asks,\n\"Are you still together?\"\n\n00:11:05.238 --> 00:11:08.358\nand is content with a yes or no answer.\n\n00:11:09.518 --> 00:11:11.454\nSo rather than that question,\n\n00:11:11.478 --> 00:11:15.134\nI would propose we ask\nsome more difficult questions,\n\n00:11:15.158 --> 00:11:16.358\nquestions like:\n\n00:11:17.038 --> 00:11:20.054\nHow do you decide who deserves your love\n\n00:11:20.078 --> 00:11:21.318\nand who does not?\n\n00:11:22.798 --> 00:11:26.054\nHow do you stay in love\nwhen things get difficult,\n\n00:11:26.078 --> 00:11:28.598\nand how do you know\nwhen to just cut and run?\n\n00:11:29.838 --> 00:11:31.734\nHow do you live with the doubt\n\n00:11:31.758 --> 00:11:34.774\nthat inevitably creeps\ninto every relationship,\n\n00:11:34.798 --> 00:11:36.414\nor even harder,\n\n00:11:36.438 --> 00:11:38.798\nhow do you live with your partner's doubt?\n\n00:11:39.758 --> 00:11:43.374\nI don't necessarily know\nthe answers to these questions,\n\n00:11:43.398 --> 00:11:48.534\nbut I think they're an important start\nat having a more thoughtful conversation\n\n00:11:48.558 --> 00:11:50.718\nabout what it means to love someone.\n\n00:11:52.038 --> 00:11:54.374\nSo, if you want it,\n\n00:11:54.398 --> 00:11:58.694\nthe short version of the story\nof my relationship is this:\n\n00:11:58.718 --> 00:12:01.814\na year ago, an acquaintance\nand I did a study\n\n00:12:01.838 --> 00:12:04.534\ndesigned to create romantic love,\n\n00:12:04.558 --> 00:12:06.254\nand we fell in love,\n\n00:12:06.278 --> 00:12:08.134\nand we are still together,\n\n00:12:08.158 --> 00:12:10.318\nand I am so glad.\n\n00:12:10.998 --> 00:12:15.758\nBut falling in love is not\nthe same thing as staying in love.\n\n00:12:16.398 --> 00:12:18.798\nFalling in love is the easy part.\n\n00:12:20.318 --> 00:12:24.694\nSo at the end of my article, I wrote,\n\"Love didn't happen to us.\n\n00:12:24.718 --> 00:12:28.014\nWe're in love because we each\nmade the choice to be.\"\n\n00:12:28.038 --> 00:12:32.214\nAnd I cringe a little\nwhen I read that now,\n\n00:12:32.238 --> 00:12:34.534\nnot because it isn't true,\n\n00:12:34.558 --> 00:12:37.774\nbut because at the time,\nI really hadn't considered\n\n00:12:37.798 --> 00:12:41.414\neverything that was contained\nin that choice.\n\n00:12:41.438 --> 00:12:46.654\nI didn't consider how many times\nwe would each have to make that choice,\n\n00:12:46.678 --> 00:12:50.254\nand how many times I will continue\nto have to make that choice\n\n00:12:50.278 --> 00:12:54.094\nwithout knowing whether or not\nhe will always choose me.\n\n00:12:54.118 --> 00:12:59.614\nI want it to be enough to have asked\nand answered 36 questions,\n\n00:12:59.638 --> 00:13:04.854\nand to have chosen to love someone\nso generous and kind and fun\n\n00:13:04.878 --> 00:13:09.878\nand to have broadcast that choice\nin the biggest newspaper in America.\n\n00:13:10.838 --> 00:13:13.934\nBut what I have done instead\nis turn my relationship\n\n00:13:13.958 --> 00:13:18.134\ninto the kind of myth\nI don't quite believe in.\n\n00:13:18.158 --> 00:13:22.414\nAnd what I want, what perhaps\nI will spend my life wanting,\n\n00:13:22.438 --> 00:13:25.134\nis for that myth to be true.\n\n00:13:25.158 --> 00:13:29.934\nI want the happy ending\nimplied by the title to my article,\n\n00:13:29.958 --> 00:13:31.454\nwhich is, incidentally,\n\n00:13:31.478 --> 00:13:35.134\nthe only part of the article\nthat I didn't actually write.\n\n00:13:35.158 --> 00:13:38.454\n(Laughter)\n\n00:13:38.478 --> 00:13:43.174\nBut what I have instead is the chance\nto make the choice to love someone,\n\n00:13:43.198 --> 00:13:46.654\nand the hope that he will choose\nto love me back,\n\n00:13:46.678 --> 00:13:49.374\nand it is terrifying,\n\n00:13:49.398 --> 00:13:51.134\nbut that's the deal with love.\n\n00:13:51.158 --> 00:13:52.398\nThank you."}, {"title": "How to find work you love", "duration":

I always wondered what this would feel like.So eight years ago, I got the worst career advice of my life. I had a friend tell me, \"Don't worry about how much you like the work you're doing now. It's all about just building your resume.\"And I'd just come back from living in Spain for a while, and I'd joined this Fortune 500 company. I thought, \"This is fantastic. I'm going to have big impact on the world.\" I had all these ideas. And within about two months, I noticed at about 10am every morning I had this strange urge to want to slam my head through the monitor of my computer. I don't know if anyone's ever felt that. And I noticed pretty soon after that that all the competitors in our space had already automated my job role. And this is right about when I got this sage advice to build up my resume.Well, as I'm trying to figure out what two-story window I'm going to jump out of and change things up, I read some altogether different advice from Warren Buffett, and he said, \"Taking jobs to build up your resume is the same as saving up sex for old age.\"(Laughter)And I heard that, and that was all I needed. Within two weeks, I was out of there, and I left with one intention: to find something that I could screw up. That's how tough it was. I wanted to have some type of impact. It didn't matter what it was.And I found pretty quickly that I wasn't alone: it turns out that over 80 percent of the people around don't enjoy their work. I'm guessing this room is different, but that's the average that Deloitte has done with their studies. So I wanted to find out, what is it that sets these people apart, the people who do the passionate, world-changing work, that wake up inspired every day, and then these people, the other 80 percent who lead these lives of quiet desperation.So I started to interview all these people doing this inspiring work, and I read books and did case studies, 300 books altogether on purpose and career and all this, totally just self-immersion, really for the selfish reason of \u2014 I wanted to find the work that I couldn't not do, what that was for me.But as I was doing this, more and more people started to ask me, \"You're into this career thing. I don't like my job. Can we sit down for lunch?\" I'd say, \"Sure.\" But I would have to warn them, because at this point, my quit rate was also 80 percent. Of the people I'd sit down with for lunch, 80 percent would quit their job within two months. I was proud of this, and it wasn't that I had any special magic. It was that I would ask one simple question. It was, \"Why are you doing the work that you're doing?\" And so often their answer would be, \"Well, because somebody told me I'm supposed to.\" And I realized that so many people around us are climbing their way up this ladder that someone tells them to climb, and it ends up being leaned up against the wrong wall, or no wall at all.The more time I spent around these people and saw this problem, I thought, what if we could create a community, a place where people could feel like they belonged and that it was OK to do things differently, to take the road less traveled, where that was encouraged, and inspire people to change? And that later became what I now call Live Your Legend, which I'll explain in a little bit. But as I've made these discoveries, I noticed a framework of really three simple things that all these different passionate world-changers have in common, whether you're a Steve Jobs or if you're just, you know, the person that has the bakery down the street. But you're doing work that embodies who you are. I want to share those three with you, so we can use them as a lens for the rest of today and hopefully the rest of our life.The first part of this three-step passionate work framework is becoming a self-expert and understanding yourself, because if you don't know what you're looking for, you're never going to find it. And the thing is that no one is going to do this for us. There's no major in university on passion and purpose and career. I don't know how that's not a required double major, but don't even get me started on that. I mean, you spend more time picking out a dorm room TV set than you do you picking your major and your area of study. But the point is, it's on us to figure that out, and we need a framework, we need a way to navigate through this.And so the first step of our compass is finding out what our unique strengths are. What are the things that we wake up loving to do no matter what, whether we're paid or we're not paid, the things that people thank us for? And the Strengths Finder 2.0 is a book and also an online tool. I highly recommend it for sorting out what it is that you're naturally good at.And next, what's our framework or our hierarchy for making decisions? Do we care about the people, our family, health, or is it achievement, success, all this stuff? We have to figure out what it is to make these decisions, so we know what our soul is made of, so that we don't go selling it to some cause we don't give a shit about.And then the next step is our experiences. All of us have these experiences. We learn things every day, every minute about what we love, what we hate, what we're good at, what we're terrible at. And if we don't spend time paying attention to that and assimilating that learning and applying it to the rest of our lives, it's all for nothing. Every day, every week, every month of every year I spend some time just reflecting on what went right, what went wrong, and what do I want to repeat, what can I apply more to my life.And even more so than that, as you see people, especially today, who inspire you, who are doing things where you say \"Oh God, what Jeff is doing, I want to be like him.\" Why are you saying that? Open up a journal. Write down what it is about them that inspires you. It's not going to be everything about their life, but whatever it is, take note on that, so over time we'll have this repository of things that we can use to apply to our life and have a more passionate existence and make a better impact. Because when we start to put these things together, we can then define what success actually means to us, and without these different parts of the compass, it's impossible. We end up in the situation \u2014 we have that scripted life that everybody seems to be living going up this ladder to nowhere.It's kind of like in Wall Street 2, if anybody saw that, the peon employee asks the big Wall Street banker CEO, \"What's your number? Everyone's got a number, where if they make this money, they'll leave it all.\" He says, \"Oh, it's simple. More.\" And he just smiles. And it's the sad state of most of the people that haven't spent time understanding what matters for them, who keep reaching for something that doesn't mean anything to us, but we're doing it because everyone said we're supposed to. But once we have this framework together, we can start to identify the things that make us come alive. You know, before this, a passion could come and hit you in the face, or maybe in your possible line of work, you might throw it away because you don't have a way of identifying it. But once you do, you can see something that's congruent with my strengths, my values, who I am as a person, so I'm going to grab ahold of this, I'm going to do something with it, and I'm going to pursue it and try to make an impact with it.And Live Your Legend and the movement we've built wouldn't exist if I didn't have this compass to identify, \"Wow, this is something I want to pursue and make a difference with.\" If we don't know what we're looking for, we're never going to find it, but once we have this framework, this compass, then we can move on to what's next \u2014 and that's not me up there \u2014 doing the impossible and pushing our limits. There's two reasons why people don't do things. One is they tell themselves they can't do them, or people around them tell them they can't do them. Either way, we start to believe it. Either we give up, or we never start in the first place.The things is, everyone was impossible until somebody did it. Every invention, every new thing in the world, people thought were crazy at first. Roger Bannister and the four-minute mile, it was a physical impossibility to break the four-minute mile in a foot race until Roger Bannister stood up and did it. And then what happened? Two months later, 16 people broke the four-minute mile. The things that we have in our head that we think are impossible are often just milestones waiting to be accomplished if we can push those limits a bit. And I think this starts with probably your physical body and fitness more than anything, because we can control that. If you don't think you can run a mile, you show yourself you can run a mile or two, or a marathon, or lose five pounds, or whatever it is, you realize that confidence compounds and can be transferred into the rest of your world.And I've actually gotten into the habit of this a little bit with my friends. We have this little group. We go on physical adventures, and recently, I found myself in a kind of precarious spot. I'm terrified of deep, dark, blue water. I don't know if anyone's ever had that same fear ever since they watched Jaws 1, 2, 3 and 4 like six times when I was a kid. But anything above here, if it's murky, I can already feel it right now. I swear there's something in there. Even if it's Lake Tahoe, it's fresh water, totally unfounded fear, ridiculous, but it's there. Anyway, three years ago I find myself on this tugboat right down here in the San Francisco Bay. It's a rainy, stormy, windy day, and people are getting sick on the boat, and I'm sitting there wearing a wetsuit, and I'm looking out the window in pure terror thinking I'm about to swim to my death. I'm going to try to swim across the Golden Gate. And my guess is some people in this room might have done that before. I'm sitting there, and my buddy Jonathan, who had talked me into it, he comes up to me and he could see the state I was in. And he says, \"Scott, hey man, what's the worst that could happen? You're wearing a wetsuit. You're not going to sink. And If you can't make it, just hop on one of the 20 kayaks. Plus, if there's a shark attack, why are they going to pick you over the 80 people in the water?\" So thanks, that helps. He's like, \"But really, just have fun with this. Good luck.\" And he dives in, swims off. OK.Turns out, the pep talk totally worked, and I felt this total feeling of calm, and I think it was because Jonathan was 13 years old.(Laughter)And of the 80 people swimming that day, 65 of them were between the ages of nine and 13. Think how you would have approached your world differently if at nine years old you found out you could swim a mile and a half in 56-degree water from Alcatraz to San Francisco. What would you have said yes to? What would you have not given up on? What would you have tried? As I'm finishing this swim, I get to Aquatic Park, and I'm getting out of the water and of course half the kids are already finished, so they're cheering me on and they're all excited. And I got total popsicle head, if anyone's ever swam in the Bay, and I'm trying to just thaw my face out, and I'm watching people finish. And I see this one kid, something didn't look right. And he's just flailing like this. And he's barely able to sip some air before he slams his head back down. And I notice other parents were watching too, and I swear they were thinking the same thing I was: this is why you don't let nine-year-olds swim from Alcatraz. This was not fatigue. All of a sudden, two parents run up and grab him, and they put him on their shoulders, and they're dragging him like this, totally limp. And then all of a sudden they walk a few more feet and they plop him down in his wheelchair. And he puts his fists up in the most insane show of victory I've ever seen. I can still feel the warmth and the energy on this guy when he made this accomplishment. I had seen him earlier that day in his wheelchair. I just had no idea he was going to swim. I mean, where is he going to be in 20 years? How many people told him he couldn't do that, that he would die if tried that?You prove people wrong, you prove yourself wrong, that you can make little incremental pushes of what you believe is possible. You don't have to be the fastest marathoner in the world, just your own impossibilities, to accomplish those, and it starts with little bitty steps. And the best way to do this is to surround yourself with passionate people. The fastest things to do things you don't think can be done is to surround yourself with people already doing them.There's this quote by Jim Rohn and it says. \"You are the average of the five people you spend the most time with.\" And there is no bigger lifehack in the history of the world from getting where you are today to where you want to be than the people you choose to put in your corner. They change everything, and it's a proven fact. In 1898, Norman Triplett did this study with a bunch of cyclists, and he would measure their times around the track in a group, and also individually. And he found that every time the cyclists in the group would cycle faster. And it's been repeated in all kinds of walks of life since then, and it proves the same thing over again, that the people around you matter, and environment is everything. But it's on you to control it, because it can go both ways. With 80 percent of people who don't like the work they do, that means most people around us, not in this room, but everywhere else, are encouraging complacency and keeping us from pursuing the things that matter to us so we have to manage those surroundings.I found myself in this situation \u2014 personal example, a couple years ago. Has anyone ever had a hobby or a passion they poured their heart and soul into, unbelievable amount of time, and they so badly want to call it a business, but no one's paying attention and it doesn't make a dime? OK, I was there for four years trying to build this Live Your Legend movement to help people do work that they genuinely cared about and that inspired them, and I was doing all I could, and there were only three people paying attention, and they're all right there: my mother, father and my wife, Chelsea. Thank you guys for the support.(Applause)And this is how badly I wanted it, it grew at zero percent for four years, and I was about to shut it down, and right about then, I moved to San Francisco and started to meet some pretty interesting people who had these crazy lifestyles of adventure, of businesses and websites and blogs that surrounded their passions and helped people in a meaningful way. And one of my friends, now, he has a family of eight, and he supports his whole family with a blog that he writes for twice a week. They just came back from a month in Europe, all of them together. This blew my mind. How does this even exist? And I got unbelievably inspired by seeing this, and instead of shutting it down, I decided, let's take it seriously. And I did everything I could to spend my time, every waking hour possible trying to hound these guys, hanging out and having beers and workouts, whatever it was. And after four years of zero growth, within six months of hanging around these people, the community at Live Your Legend grew by 10 times. In another 12 months, it grew by 160 times. And today over 30,000 people from 158 countries use our career and connection tools on a monthly basis. And those people have made up that community of passionate folks who inspired that possibility that I dreamed of for Live Your Legend so many years back.The people change everything, and this is why \u2014 you know, you ask what was going on. Well, for four years, I knew nobody in this space, and I didn't even know it existed, that people could do this stuff, that you could have movements like this. And then I'm over here in San Francisco, and everyone around me was doing it. It became normal, so my thinking went from how could I possibly do this to how could I possibly not. And right then, when that happens, that switch goes on in your head, it ripples across your whole world. And without even trying, your standards go from here to here. You don't need to change your goals. You just need to change your surroundings. That's it, and that's why I love being around this whole group of people, why I go to every TED event I can, and watch them on my iPad on the way to work, whatever it is. Because this is the group of people that inspires possibility. We have a whole day to spend together and plenty more.To sum things up, in terms of these three pillars, they all have one thing in common more than anything else. They are 100 percent in our control. No one can tell you you can't learn about yourself. No one can tell you you can't push your limits and learn your own impossible and push that. No one can tell you you can't surround yourself with inspiring people or get away from the people who bring you down. You can't control a recession. You can't control getting fired or getting in a car accident. Most things are totally out of our hands. These three things are totally on us, and they can change our whole world if we decide to do something about it.And the thing is, it's starting to happen on a widespread level. I just read in Forbes, the US Government reported for the first time in a month where more people had quit their jobs than had been laid off. They thought this was an anomaly, but it's happened three months straight. In a time where people claim it's kind of a tough environment, people are giving a middle finger to this scripted life, the things that people say you're supposed to do, in exchange for things that matter to them and do the things that inspire them.And the thing is, people are waking up to this possibility, that really the only thing that limits possibility now is imagination. That's not a clich\u00e9 anymore. I don't care what it is that you're into, what passion, what hobby. If you're into knitting, you can find someone who is killing it knitting, and you can learn from them. It's wild. And that's what this whole day is about, to learn from the folks speaking, and we profile these people on Live Your Legend every day, because when ordinary people are doing the extraordinary, and we can be around that, it becomes normal. And this isn't about being Gandhi or Steve Jobs, doing something crazy. It's just about doing something that matters to you, and makes an impact that only you can make.Speaking of Gandhi, he was a recovering lawyer, as I've heard the term, and he was called to a greater cause, something that mattered to him, he couldn't not do. And he has this quote that I absolutely live by. \"First they ignore you, then they laugh at you, then they fight you, then you win.\"Everything was impossible until somebody did it. You can either hang around the people who tell you it can't be done and tell you you're stupid for trying, or surround yourself with the people who inspire possibility, the people who are in this room. Because I see it as our responsibility to show the world that what's seen as impossible can become that new normal. And that's already starting to happen. First, do the things that inspire us, so we can inspire other people to do the things that inspire them. But we can't find that unless we know what we're looking for. We have to do our work on ourself, be intentional about that, and make those discoveries. Because I imagine a world where 80 percent of people love the work they do. What would that look like? What would the innovation be like? How would you treat the people around you? Things would start to change.And as we finish up, I have just one question to ask you guys, and I think it's the only question that matters. And it's what is the work you can't not do? Discover that, live it, not just for you, but for everybody around you, because that is what starts to change the world. What is the work you can't not do?Thank you guys.(Applause)", "id": 2332, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:12.198 --> 00:00:15.214\nWow, what an honor.

--> 00:01:05.094\nwhat two-story window I'm going\nto jump out of and change things up,\n\n00:01:05.118 --> 00:01:08.854\nI read some altogether different advice\nfrom Warren Buffett, and he said,\n\n00:01:08.878 --> 00:01:14.494\n\"Taking jobs to build up your resume\nis the same as saving up sex for old age.\"\n\n00:01:14.518 --> 00:01:16.254\n(Laughter)\n\n00:01:16.277 --> 00:01:18.574\nAnd I heard that,\nand that was all I needed.\n\n00:01:18.598 --> 00:01:21.814\nWithin two weeks, I was out of there,\nand I left with one intention:\n\n00:01:21.838 --> 00:01:24.894\nto find something that I could screw up.\nThat's how tough it was.\n\n00:01:24.918 --> 00:01:27.934\nI wanted to have some type of impact.\nIt didn't matter what it was.\n\n00:01:27.958 --> 00:01:30.673\nAnd I found pretty quickly\nthat I wasn't alone:\n\n00:01:30.697 --> 00:01:33.534\nit turns out that over 80 percent\nof the people around\n\n00:01:33.558 --> 00:01:35.054\ndon't enjoy their work.\n\n00:01:35.078 --> 00:01:36.614\nI'm guessing this room is different,\n\n00:01:36.638 --> 00:01:39.494\nbut that's the average\nthat Deloitte has done with their studies.\n\n00:01:39.518 --> 00:01:42.566\nSo I wanted to find out,\nwhat is it that sets these people apart,\n\n00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:44.926\nthe people who do the passionate,\nworld-changing work,\n\n00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:46.574\nthat wake up inspired every day,\n\n00:01:46.598 --> 00:01:48.374\nand then these people,\nthe other 80 percent\n\n00:01:48.398 --> 00:01:50.454\nwho lead these lives of quiet desperation.\n\n00:01:50.478 --> 00:01:53.734\nSo I started to interview all these people\ndoing this inspiring work,\n\n00:01:53.758 --> 00:01:56.574\nand I read books and did case studies,\n\n00:01:56.598 --> 00:01:59.294\n300 books altogether\non purpose and career and all this,\n\n00:01:59.318 --> 00:02:03.638\ntotally just self-immersion,\nreally for the selfish reason of --\n\n00:02:04.198 --> 00:02:06.694\nI wanted to find the work\nthat I couldn't not do,\n\n00:02:06.718 --> 00:02:08.254\nwhat that was for me.\n\n00:02:08.278 --> 00:02:10.920\nBut as I was doing this,\nmore and more people started to ask me,\n\n00:02:10.944 --> 00:02:12.414\n\"You're into this career thing.\n\n00:02:12.438 --> 00:02:14.654\nI don't like my job.\nCan we sit down for lunch?\"\n\n00:02:14.678 --> 00:02:16.854\nI'd say, \"Sure.\"\nBut I would have to warn them,\n\n00:02:16.878 --> 00:02:19.174\nbecause at this point,\nmy quit rate was also 80 percent.\n\n00:02:19.198 --> 00:02:22.424\nOf the people I'd sit down with for lunch,\n80 percent would quit their job\n\n00:02:22.449 --> 00:02:23.614\nwithin two months.\n\n00:02:23.638 --> 00:02:27.854\nI was proud of this, and it wasn't\nthat I had any special magic.\n\n00:02:27.878 --> 00:02:29.926\nIt was that I would ask\none simple question.\n\n00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:32.566\nIt was, \"Why are you doing\nthe work that you're doing?\"\n\n00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:34.694\nAnd so often their answer would be,\n\n00:02:34.718 --> 00:02:37.014\n\"Well, because somebody\ntold me I'm supposed to.\"\n\n00:02:37.038 --> 00:02:39.174\nAnd I realized that so many\npeople around us\n\n00:02:39.198 --> 00:02:42.814\nare climbing their way up this ladder\nthat someone tells them to climb,\n\n00:02:42.838 --> 00:02:45.374\nand it ends up being leaned up\nagainst the wrong wall,\n\n00:02:45.398 --> 00:02:47.054\nor no wall at all.\n\n00:02:47.078 --> 00:02:49.774\nThe more time I spent around\nthese people and saw this problem,\n\n00:02:49.798 --> 00:02:52.014\nI thought, what if we could\ncreate a community,\n\n00:02:52.038 --> 00:02:54.414\na place where people\ncould feel like they belonged\n\n00:02:54.438 --> 00:02:56.581\nand that it was OK\nto do things differently,\n\n00:02:56.605 --> 00:02:59.320\nto take the road less traveled,\nwhere that was encouraged,\n\n00:02:59.344 --> 00:03:01.894\nand inspire people to change?\n\n00:03:01.918 --> 00:03:04.614\nAnd that later became\nwhat I now call Live Your Legend,\n\n00:03:04.638 --> 00:03:06.305\nwhich I'll explain in a little bit.\n\n00:03:06.329 --> 00:03:10.014\nBut as I've made these discoveries,\nI noticed a framework\n\n00:03:10.038 --> 00:03:11.419\nof really three simple things\n\n00:03:11.443 --> 00:03:14.574\nthat all these different passionate\nworld-changers have in common,\n\n00:03:14.598 --> 00:03:17.254\nwhether you're a Steve Jobs\nor if you're just, you know,\n\n00:03:17.278 --> 00:03:19.334\nthe person that has\nthe bakery down the street.\n\n00:03:19.358 --> 00:03:21.374\nBut you're doing work\nthat embodies who you are.\n\n00:03:21.398 --> 00:03:24.294\nI want to share those three with you,\nso we can use them as a lens\n\n00:03:24.318 --> 00:03:26.985\nfor the rest of today\nand hopefully the rest of our life.\n\n00:03:27.009 --> 00:03:29.785\nThe first part of this three-step\npassionate work framework\n\n00:03:29.809 --> 00:03:32.734\nis becoming a self-expert\nand understanding yourself,\n\n00:03:32.758 --> 00:03:35.414\nbecause if you don't know\nwhat you're looking for,\n\n00:03:35.438 --> 00:03:37.054\nyou're never going to find it.\n\n00:03:37.078 --> 00:03:39.698\nAnd the thing is that no one\nis going to do this for us.\n\n00:03:39.722 --> 00:03:43.414\nThere's no major in university\non passion and purpose and career.\n\n00:03:43.438 --> 00:03:45.694\nI don't know how that's not\na required double major,\n\n00:03:45.718 --> 00:03:47.534\nbut don't even get me started on that.\n\n00:03:47.558 --> 00:03:50.534\nI mean, you spend more time\npicking out a dorm room TV set\n\n00:03:50.558 --> 00:03:53.494\nthan you do you picking your major\nand your area of study.\n\n00:03:53.518 --> 00:03:56.134\nBut the point is,\nit's on us to figure that out,\n\n00:03:56.158 --> 00:03:59.374\nand we need a framework,\nwe need a way to navigate through this.\n\n00:03:59.398 --> 00:04:03.256\nAnd so the first step of our compass is\nfinding out what our unique strengths are.\n\n00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:06.294\nWhat are the things that we wake up\nloving to do no matter what,\n\n00:04:06.318 --> 00:04:09.814\nwhether we're paid or we're not paid,\nthe things that people thank us for?\n\n00:04:09.838 --> 00:04:12.814\nAnd the Strengths Finder 2.0\nis a book and also an online tool.\n\n00:04:12.838 --> 00:04:16.574\nI highly recommend it for sorting out\nwhat it is that you're naturally good at.\n\n00:04:16.598 --> 00:04:21.014\nAnd next, what's our framework\nor our hierarchy for making decisions?\n\n00:04:21.038 --> 00:04:25.254\nDo we care about the people,\nour family, health,\n\n00:04:25.278 --> 00:04:27.414\nor is it achievement, success,\nall this stuff?\n\n00:04:27.438 --> 00:04:30.105\nWe have to figure out what it is\nto make these decisions,\n\n00:04:30.129 --> 00:04:31.854\nso we know what our soul is made of,\n\n00:04:31.878 --> 00:04:36.574\nso that we don't go selling it\nto some cause we don't give a shit about.\n\n00:04:36.598 --> 00:04:40.294\nAnd then the next step is our experiences.\n\n00:04:40.318 --> 00:04:43.774\nAll of us have these experiences.\nWe learn things every day, every minute\n\n00:04:43.798 --> 00:04:45.494\nabout what we love, what we hate,\n\n00:04:45.518 --> 00:04:47.518\nwhat we're good at,\nwhat we're terrible at.\n\n00:04:47.542 --> 00:04:49.934\nAnd if we don't spend time\npaying attention to that\n\n00:04:49.958 --> 00:04:51.494\nand assimilating that learning\n\n00:04:51.518 --> 00:04:54.494\nand applying it to the rest of our lives,\nit's all for nothing.\n\n00:04:54.518 --> 00:04:57.174\nEvery day, every week,\nevery month of every year\n\n00:04:57.198 --> 00:04:59.654\nI spend some time\njust reflecting on what went right,\n\n00:04:59.678 --> 00:05:01.821\nwhat went wrong,\nand what do I want to repeat,\n\n00:05:01.845 --> 00:05:03.421\nwhat can I apply more to my life.\n\n00:05:03.445 --> 00:05:06.534\nAnd even more so than that,\nas you see people, especially today,\n\n00:05:06.558 --> 00:05:08.939\nwho inspire you, who are doing\nthings where you say\n\n00:05:08.963 --> 00:05:11.894\n\"Oh God, what Jeff is doing,\nI want to be like him.\"\n\n00:05:11.918 --> 00:05:13.639\nWhy are you saying that?\nOpen up a journal.\n\n00:05:13.664 --> 00:05:15.734\nWrite down what it is about them\nthat inspires you.\n\n00:05:15.758 --> 00:05:17.814\nIt's not going to be\neverything about their life,\n\n00:05:17.838 --> 00:05:19.654\nbut whatever it is, take note on that,\n\n00:05:19.678 --> 00:05:21.974\nso over time we'll have\nthis repository of things\n\n00:05:21.998 --> 00:05:26.214\nthat we can use to apply to our life\nand have a more passionate existence\n\n00:05:26.238 --> 00:05:27.734\nand make a better impact.\n\n00:05:27.758 --> 00:05:30.139\nBecause when we start\nto put these things together,\n\n00:05:30.163 --> 00:05:33.454\nwe can then define\nwhat success actually means to us,\n\n00:05:33.478 --> 00:05:36.614\nand without these different parts\nof the compass, it's impossible.\n\n00:05:36.638 --> 00:05:39.258\nWe end up in the situation --\nwe have that scripted life\n\n00:05:39.282 --> 00:05:42.414\nthat everybody seems to be living\ngoing up this ladder to nowhere.\n\n00:05:42.438 --> 00:05:45.094\nIt's kind of like in Wall Street 2,\nif anybody saw that,\n\n00:05:45.118 --> 00:05:48.934\nthe peon employee asks\nthe big Wall Street banker CEO,\n\n00:05:48.958 --> 00:05:51.094\n\"What's your number?\nEveryone's got a number,\n\n00:05:51.118 --> 00:05:53.654\nwhere if they make this money,\nthey'll leave it all.\"\n\n00:05:53.678 --> 00:05:56.198\nHe says, \"Oh, it's simple. More.\"\n\n00:05:57.078 --> 00:05:58.374\nAnd he just smiles.\n\n00:05:58.398 --> 00:06:00.174\nAnd it's the sad state\nof most of the people\n\n00:06:00.198 --> 00:06:02.734\nthat haven't spent time\nunderstanding what matters for them,\n\n00:06:02.758 --> 00:06:05.494\nwho keep reaching for something\nthat doesn't mean anything to us,\n\n00:06:05.518 --> 00:06:08.014\nbut we're doing it because everyone\nsaid we're supposed to.\n\n00:06:08.038 --> 00:06:09.774\nBut once we have this framework together,\n\n00:06:09.798 --> 00:06:12.414\nwe can start to identify\nthe things that make us come alive.\n\n00:06:12.438 --> 00:06:15.654\nYou know, before this, a passion\ncould come and hit you in the face,\n\n00:06:15.678 --> 00:06:18.374\nor maybe in your possible line of work,\nyou might throw it away\n\n00:06:18.398 --> 00:06:20.589\nbecause you don't have\na way of identifying it.\n\n00:06:20.613 --> 00:06:24.149\nBut once you do, you can see something\nthat's congruent with my strengths,\n\n00:06:24.173 --> 00:06:25.974\nmy values, who I am as a person,\n\n00:06:25.998 --> 00:06:29.284\nso I'm going to grab ahold of this,\nI'm going to do something with it,\n\n00:06:29.308 --> 00:06:32.166\nand I'm going to pursue it\nand try to make an impact with it.\n\n00:06:32.190 --> 00:06:34.734\nAnd Live Your Legend\nand the movement we've built\n\n00:06:34.758 --> 00:06:37.425\nwouldn't exist if I didn't have\nthis compass to identify,\n\n00:06:37.449 --> 00:06:40.694\n\"Wow, this is something I want to pursue\nand make a difference with.\"\n\n00:06:40.718 --> 00:06:43.774\nIf we don't know what we're looking for,\nwe're never going to find it,\n\n00:06:43.798 --> 00:06:46.334\nbut once we have\nthis framework, this compass,\n\n00:06:46.358 --> 00:06:50.814\nthen we can move on to what's next --\nand that's not me up there --\n\n00:06:50.838 --> 00:06:53.054\ndoing the impossible\nand pushing our limits.\n\n00:06:53.078 --> 00:06:55.094\nThere's two reasons\nwhy people don't do things.\n\n00:06:55.118 --> 00:06:57.094\nOne is they tell themselves\nthey can't do them,\n\n00:06:57.118 --> 00:06:59.254\nor people around them\ntell them they can't do them.\n\n00:06:59.278 --> 00:07:00.814\nEither way, we start to believe it.\n\n00:07:00.838 --> 00:07:03.214\nEither we give up,\nor we never start in the first place.\n\n00:07:03.238 --> 00:07:06.134\nThe things is, everyone was impossible\nuntil somebody did it.\n\n00:07:06.158 --> 00:07:08.694\nEvery invention,\nevery new thing in the world,\n\n00:07:08.718 --> 00:07:10.385\npeople thought were crazy at first.\n\n00:07:10.409 --> 00:07:13.838\nRoger Bannister and the four-minute mile,\nit was a physical impossibility\n\n00:07:13.862 --> 00:07:16.254\nto break the four-minute mile\nin a foot race\n\n00:07:16.278 --> 00:07:18.294\nuntil Roger Bannister stood up and did it.\n\n00:07:18.318 --> 00:07:19.534\nAnd then what happened?\n\n00:07:19.558 --> 00:07:22.174\nTwo months later,\n16 people broke the four-minute mile.\n\n00:07:22.198 --> 00:07:24.934\nThe things that we have in our head\nthat we think are impossible\n\n00:07:24.958 --> 00:07:27.094\nare often just milestones\nwaiting to be accomplished\n\n00:07:27.118 --> 00:07:28.738\nif we can push those limits a bit.\n\n00:07:28.762 --> 00:07:32.134\nAnd I think this starts with probably\nyour physical body and fitness\n\n00:07:32.158 --> 00:07:34.694\nmore than anything,\nbecause we can control that.\n\n00:07:34.718 --> 00:07:36.334\nIf you don't think you can run a mile,\n\n00:07:36.358 --> 00:07:38.414\nyou show yourself\nyou can run a mile or two,\n\n00:07:38.438 --> 00:07:40.974\nor a marathon, or lose five pounds,\nor whatever it is,\n\n00:07:40.998 --> 00:07:43.494\nyou realize that confidence compounds\n\n00:07:43.518 --> 00:07:46.014\nand can be transferred\ninto the rest of your world.\n\n00:07:46.038 --> 00:07:49.694\nAnd I've actually gotten into the habit\nof this a little bit with my friends.\n\n00:07:49.718 --> 00:07:52.454\nWe have this little group.\nWe go on physical adventures,\n\n00:07:52.478 --> 00:07:55.574\nand recently, I found myself\nin a kind of precarious spot.\n\n00:07:55.598 --> 00:07:58.614\nI'm terrified of deep, dark, blue water.\n\n00:07:58.638 --> 00:08:00.654\nI don't know if anyone's ever had\nthat same fear\n\n00:08:00.678 --> 00:08:03.277\never since they watched\nJaws 1, 2, 3 and 4 like six times\n\n00:08:03.302 --> 00:08:04.454\nwhen I was a kid.\n\n00:08:04.478 --> 00:08:09.014\nBut anything above here, if it's murky,\nI can already feel it right now.\n\n00:08:09.038 --> 00:08:10.814\nI swear there's something in there.\n\n00:08:10.838 --> 00:08:13.974\nEven if it's Lake Tahoe,\nit's fresh water, totally unfounded fear,\n\n00:08:13.998 --> 00:08:15.654\nridiculous, but it's there.\n\n00:08:15.678 --> 00:08:18.174\nAnyway, three years ago\nI find myself on this tugboat\n\n00:08:18.198 --> 00:08:20.174\nright down here in the San Francisco Bay.\n\n00:08:20.198 --> 00:08:23.654\nIt's a rainy, stormy, windy day,\nand people are getting sick on the boat,\n\n00:08:23.678 --> 00:08:27.012\nand I'm sitting there wearing a wetsuit,\nand I'm looking out the window\n\n00:08:27.036 --> 00:08:30.014\nin pure terror thinking\nI'm about to swim to my death.\n\n00:08:30.038 --> 00:08:32.294\nI'm going to try to swim\nacross the Golden Gate.\n\n00:08:32.318 --> 00:08:36.134\nAnd my guess is some people in this room\nmight have done that before.\n\n00:08:36.158 --> 00:08:39.374\nI'm sitting there, and my buddy Jonathan,\nwho had talked me into it,\n\n00:08:39.398 --> 00:08:41.654\nhe comes up to me\nand he could see the state I was in.\n\n00:08:41.678 --> 00:08:44.414\nAnd he says, \"Scott, hey man,\nwhat's the worst that could happen?\n\n00:08:44.438 --> 00:08:46.574\nYou're wearing a wetsuit.\nYou're not going to sink.\n\n00:08:46.598 --> 00:08:49.414\nAnd If you can't make it,\njust hop on one of the 20 kayaks.\n\n00:08:49.438 --> 00:08:52.254\nPlus, if there's a shark attack,\nwhy are they going to pick you\n\n00:08:52.278 --> 00:08:54.898\nover the 80 people in the water?\"\nSo thanks, that helps.\n\n00:08:54.922 --> 00:08:57.778\nHe's like, \"But really,\njust have fun with this. Good luck.\"\n\n00:08:57.802 --> 00:09:00.294\nAnd he dives in, swims off. OK.\n\n00:09:00.318 --> 00:09:04.694\nTurns out, the pep talk totally worked,\nand I felt this total feeling of calm,\n\n00:09:04.718 --> 00:09:07.654\nand I think it was because\nJonathan was 13 years old.\n\n00:09:07.678 --> 00:09:09.614\n(Laughter)\n\n00:09:09.638 --> 00:09:12.334\nAnd of the 80 people swimming that day,\n\n00:09:12.358 --> 00:09:15.174\n65 of them were between\nthe ages of nine and 13.\n\n00:09:15.198 --> 00:09:17.934\nThink how you would have approached\nyour world differently\n\n00:09:17.958 --> 00:09:21.134\nif at nine years old you found out\nyou could swim a mile and a half\n\n00:09:21.158 --> 00:09:23.854\nin 56-degree water\nfrom Alcatraz to San Francisco.\n\n00:09:23.878 --> 00:09:25.294\nWhat would you have said yes to?\n\n00:09:25.318 --> 00:09:28.174\nWhat would you have not given up on?\nWhat would you have tried?\n\n00:09:28.198 --> 00:09:30.294\nAs I'm finishing this swim,\nI get to Aquatic Park,\n\n00:09:30.318 --> 00:09:31.694\nand I'm getting out of the water\n\n00:09:31.718 --> 00:09:33.814\nand of course half the kids\nare already finished,\n\n00:09:33.838 --> 00:09:36.172\nso they're cheering me on\nand they're all excited.\n\n00:09:36.196 --> 00:09:39.212\nAnd I got total popsicle head,\nif anyone's ever swam in the Bay,\n\n00:09:39.236 --> 00:09:42.734\nand I'm trying to just thaw my face out,\nand I'm watching people finish.\n\n00:09:42.768 --> 00:09:45.784\nAnd I see this one kid,\nsomething didn't look right.\n\n00:09:45.798 --> 00:09:47.814\nAnd he's just flailing like this.\n\n00:09:47.838 --> 00:09:51.254\nAnd he's barely able to sip some air\nbefore he slams his head back down.\n\n00:09:51.278 --> 00:09:53.494\nAnd I notice other parents\nwere watching too,\n\n00:09:53.518 --> 00:09:55.974\nand I swear they were thinking\nthe same thing I was:\n\n00:09:55.998 --> 00:09:59.934\nthis is why you don't let nine-year-olds\nswim from Alcatraz.\n\n00:09:59.958 --> 00:10:01.174\nThis was not fatigue.\n\n00:10:01.198 --> 00:10:03.494\nAll of a sudden, two parents\nrun up and grab him,\n\n00:10:03.518 --> 00:10:07.294\nand they put him on their shoulders,\nand they're dragging him like this,\n\n00:10:07.318 --> 00:10:09.174\ntotally limp.\n\n00:10:09.198 --> 00:10:11.534\nAnd then all of a sudden\nthey walk a few more feet\n\n00:10:11.558 --> 00:10:13.534\nand they plop him down in his wheelchair.\n\n00:10:13.558 --> 00:10:17.094\nAnd he puts his fists up in the most\ninsane show of victory I've ever seen.\n\n00:10:17.118 --> 00:10:19.774\nI can still feel the warmth\nand the energy on this guy\n\n00:10:19.798 --> 00:10:21.374\nwhen he made this accomplishment.\n\n00:10:21.398 --> 00:10:24.374\nI had seen him earlier that day\nin his wheelchair.\n\n00:10:24.398 --> 00:10:26.374\nI just had no idea he was going to swim.\n\n00:10:26.398 --> 00:10:29.494\nI mean, where is he\ngoing to be in 20 years?\n\n00:10:29.518 --> 00:10:32.934\nHow many people told him he couldn't\ndo that, that he would die if tried that?\n\n00:10:32.958 --> 00:10:35.094\nYou prove people wrong,\nyou prove yourself wrong,\n\n00:10:35.118 --> 00:10:36.934\nthat you can make\nlittle incremental pushes\n\n00:10:36.958 --> 00:10:38.494\nof what you believe is possible.\n\n00:10:38.518 --> 00:10:40.934\nYou don't have to be\nthe fastest marathoner in the world,\n\n00:10:40.958 --> 00:10:43.339\njust your own impossibilities,\nto accomplish those,\n\n00:10:43.363 --> 00:10:45.339\nand it starts with little bitty steps.\n\n00:10:45.363 --> 00:10:47.694\nAnd the best way to do this\n\n00:10:47.718 --> 00:10:49.934\nis to surround yourself\nwith passionate people.\n\n00:10:49.958 --> 00:10:52.720\nThe fastest things to do things\nyou don't think can be done\n\n00:10:52.744 --> 00:10:55.316\nis to surround yourself\nwith people already doing them.\n\n00:10:55.340 --> 00:10:57.774\nThere's this quote by Jim Rohn and it says.\n\n00:10:57.798 --> 00:11:01.174\n\"You are the average of the five people\nyou spend the most time with.\"\n\n00:11:01.198 --> 00:11:04.494\nAnd there is no bigger lifehack\nin the history of the world\n\n00:11:04.518 --> 00:11:07.574\nfrom getting where you are today\nto where you want to be\n\n00:11:07.598 --> 00:11:10.494\nthan the people you choose\nto put in your corner.\n\n00:11:10.518 --> 00:11:12.814\nThey change everything,\nand it's a proven fact.\n\n00:11:12.838 --> 00:11:17.134\nIn 1898, Norman Triplett did this study\nwith a bunch of cyclists,\n\n00:11:17.158 --> 00:11:19.958\nand he would measure their times\naround the track in a group,\n\n00:11:19.983 --> 00:11:21.134\nand also individually.\n\n00:11:21.158 --> 00:11:24.854\nAnd he found that every time the cyclists\nin the group would cycle faster.\n\n00:11:24.878 --> 00:11:27.694\nAnd it's been repeated\nin all kinds of walks of life since then,\n\n00:11:27.718 --> 00:11:29.614\nand it proves the same thing over again,\n\n00:11:29.638 --> 00:11:32.494\nthat the people around you matter,\nand environment is everything.\n\n00:11:32.518 --> 00:11:35.094\nBut it's on you to control it,\nbecause it can go both ways.\n\n00:11:35.118 --> 00:11:37.694\nWith 80 percent of people\nwho don't like the work they do,\n\n00:11:37.718 --> 00:11:40.894\nthat means most people around us,\nnot in this room, but everywhere else,\n\n00:11:40.918 --> 00:11:44.574\nare encouraging complacency and keeping us\nfrom pursuing the things that matter to us\n\n00:11:44.598 --> 00:11:46.654\nso we have to manage those surroundings.\n\n00:11:46.678 --> 00:11:48.678\nI found myself in this situation --\n\n00:11:50.638 --> 00:11:53.534\npersonal example, a couple years ago.\n\n00:11:53.558 --> 00:11:57.734\nHas anyone ever had a hobby or a passion\nthey poured their heart and soul into,\n\n00:11:57.758 --> 00:12:01.254\nunbelievable amount of time, and they\nso badly want to call it a business,\n\n00:12:01.278 --> 00:12:05.414\nbut no one's paying attention\nand it doesn't make a dime?\n\n00:12:05.438 --> 00:12:09.534\nOK, I was there for four years trying\nto build this Live Your Legend movement\n\n00:12:09.558 --> 00:12:12.894\nto help people do work that they genuinely\ncared about and that inspired them,\n\n00:12:12.918 --> 00:12:14.254\nand I was doing all I could,\n\n00:12:14.278 --> 00:12:16.454\nand there were only\nthree people paying attention,\n\n00:12:16.478 --> 00:12:19.717\nand they're all right there:\nmy mother, father and my wife, Chelsea.\n\n00:12:19.741 --> 00:12:21.237\nThank you guys for the support.\n\n00:12:21.261 --> 00:12:22.734\n(Applause)\n\n00:12:22.758 --> 00:12:27.454\nAnd this is how badly I wanted it,\nit grew at zero percent for four years,\n\n00:12:27.478 --> 00:12:29.454\nand I was about to shut it down,\n\n00:12:29.478 --> 00:12:31.174\nand right about then,\n\n00:12:31.198 --> 00:12:34.734\nI moved to San Francisco and started\nto meet some pretty interesting people\n\n00:12:34.758 --> 00:12:36.974\nwho had these crazy\nlifestyles of adventure,\n\n00:12:36.998 --> 00:12:39.014\nof businesses and websites and blogs\n\n00:12:39.038 --> 00:12:42.294\nthat surrounded their passions\nand helped people in a meaningful way.\n\n00:12:42.318 --> 00:12:44.974\nAnd one of my friends,\nnow, he has a family of eight,\n\n00:12:44.998 --> 00:12:47.334\nand he supports his whole family\n\n00:12:47.358 --> 00:12:50.214\nwith a blog that he\nwrites for twice a week.\n\n00:12:50.238 --> 00:12:53.286\nThey just came back from a month\nin Europe, all of them together.\n\n00:12:53.310 --> 00:12:55.374\nThis blew my mind.\nHow does this even exist?\n\n00:12:55.398 --> 00:12:58.894\nAnd I got unbelievably inspired\nby seeing this,\n\n00:12:58.918 --> 00:13:01.894\nand instead of shutting it down,\nI decided, let's take it seriously.\n\n00:13:01.918 --> 00:13:03.894\nAnd I did everything I could\nto spend my time,\n\n00:13:03.918 --> 00:13:06.414\nevery waking hour possible\ntrying to hound these guys,\n\n00:13:06.438 --> 00:13:09.214\nhanging out and having beers\nand workouts, whatever it was.\n\n00:13:09.238 --> 00:13:10.974\nAnd after four years of zero growth,\n\n00:13:10.998 --> 00:13:13.334\nwithin six months\nof hanging around these people,\n\n00:13:13.358 --> 00:13:16.054\nthe community at Live Your Legend\ngrew by 10 times.\n\n00:13:16.078 --> 00:13:19.934\nIn another 12 months,\nit grew by 160 times.\n\n00:13:19.958 --> 00:13:23.014\nAnd today over 30,000 people\nfrom 158 countries\n\n00:13:23.038 --> 00:13:26.134\nuse our career and connection tools\non a monthly basis.\n\n00:13:26.158 --> 00:13:30.534\nAnd those people have made up\nthat community of passionate folks\n\n00:13:30.558 --> 00:13:32.774\nwho inspired that possibility\nthat I dreamed of\n\n00:13:32.798 --> 00:13:35.974\nfor Live Your Legend so many years back.\n\n00:13:35.998 --> 00:13:38.254\nThe people change everything,\nand this is why --\n\n00:13:38.278 --> 00:13:40.494\nyou know, you ask what was going on.\n\n00:13:40.518 --> 00:13:42.974\nWell, for four years,\nI knew nobody in this space,\n\n00:13:42.998 --> 00:13:46.494\nand I didn't even know it existed,\nthat people could do this stuff,\n\n00:13:46.518 --> 00:13:48.494\nthat you could have movements like this.\n\n00:13:48.518 --> 00:13:52.174\nAnd then I'm over here in San Francisco,\nand everyone around me was doing it.\n\n00:13:52.198 --> 00:13:56.294\nIt became normal, so my thinking went\nfrom how could I possibly do this\n\n00:13:56.318 --> 00:13:58.134\nto how could I possibly not.\n\n00:13:58.158 --> 00:14:01.374\nAnd right then, when that happens,\nthat switch goes on in your head,\n\n00:14:01.398 --> 00:14:03.065\nit ripples across your whole world.\n\n00:14:03.089 --> 00:14:06.014\nAnd without even trying,\nyour standards go from here to here.\n\n00:14:06.038 --> 00:14:09.753\nYou don't need to change your goals.\nYou just need to change your surroundings.\n\n00:14:09.777 --> 00:14:14.134\nThat's it, and that's why I love\nbeing around this whole group of people,\n\n00:14:14.158 --> 00:14:15.778\nwhy I go to every TED event I can,\n\n00:14:15.802 --> 00:14:18.734\nand watch them on my iPad\non the way to work, whatever it is.\n\n00:14:18.758 --> 00:14:22.174\nBecause this is the group of people\nthat inspires possibility.\n\n00:14:22.198 --> 00:14:25.214\nWe have a whole day\nto spend together and plenty more.\n\n00:14:25.238 --> 00:14:28.694\nTo sum things up,\nin terms of these three pillars,\n\n00:14:28.718 --> 00:14:32.654\nthey all have one thing in common\nmore than anything else.\n\n00:14:32.678 --> 00:14:35.134\nThey are 100 percent in our control.\n\n00:14:35.158 --> 00:14:38.214\nNo one can tell you\nyou can't learn about yourself.\n\n00:14:38.238 --> 00:14:40.381\nNo one can tell you\nyou can't push your limits\n\n00:14:40.405 --> 00:14:42.694\nand learn your own impossible\nand push that.\n\n00:14:42.718 --> 00:14:45.654\nNo one can tell you you can't\nsurround yourself with inspiring people\n\n00:14:45.678 --> 00:14:47.869\nor get away from the people\nwho bring you down.\n\n00:14:47.893 --> 00:14:49.322\nYou can't control a recession.\n\n00:14:49.346 --> 00:14:52.534\nYou can't control getting fired\nor getting in a car accident.\n\n00:14:52.558 --> 00:14:54.654\nMost things are totally out of our hands.\n\n00:14:54.678 --> 00:14:57.038\nThese three things are totally on us,\n\n00:14:58.958 --> 00:15:03.108\nand they can change our whole world\nif we decide to do something about it.\n\n00:15:04.038 --> 00:15:07.038\nAnd the thing is, it's starting to happen\non a widespread level.\n\n00:15:07.062 --> 00:15:10.253\nI just read in Forbes, the US Government\nreported for the first time\n\n00:15:10.277 --> 00:15:12.974\nin a month where more people\nhad quit their jobs\n\n00:15:12.998 --> 00:15:14.334\nthan had been laid off.\n\n00:15:14.358 --> 00:15:17.574\nThey thought this was an anomaly,\nbut it's happened three months straight.\n\n00:15:17.598 --> 00:15:20.294\nIn a time where people claim\nit's kind of a tough environment,\n\n00:15:20.318 --> 00:15:22.654\npeople are giving a middle finger\nto this scripted life,\n\n00:15:22.678 --> 00:15:24.734\nthe things that people\nsay you're supposed to do,\n\n00:15:24.758 --> 00:15:28.494\nin exchange for things that matter to them\nand do the things that inspire them.\n\n00:15:28.518 --> 00:15:31.294\nAnd the thing is, people\nare waking up to this possibility,\n\n00:15:31.318 --> 00:15:37.294\nthat really the only thing that limits\npossibility now is imagination.\n\n00:15:37.318 --> 00:15:39.294\nThat's not a clich\u00e9 anymore.\n\n00:15:39.318 --> 00:15:42.494\nI don't care

In the Name of Allah, the most Gracious, the most Merciful.(English) I was born in a middle class family. My father was five years old when he lost his father, but by the time I was born, he was already a businessman. But it didn't make a difference to him if his children were going to be a boy or a girl: they were going to go to school. So I guess I was the lucky one.My mother had 16 pregnancies. From 16 pregnancies, five of us are alive. You can imagine as a child what I went through. Day to day, I watched women being carried to a graveyard, or watched children going to a graveyard. At that time, when I finished my high school, I really wanted to be a doctor. I wanted to be a doctor to help women and children. So I completed my education, but I wanted to go to university. Unfortunately, in my country, there wasn't a dormitory for girls, so I was accepted in medical school, but I could not go there. So as a result, my father sent me to America.I came to America. I completed my education. While I was completing my education, my country was invaded by Russia. And do you know that at the time I was completing my education, I didn't know what was going on with my family or with my country. There were months, years, I didn't know about it. My family was in a refugee camp. So as soon as I completed my education, I brought my family to America. I wanted them to be safe.But where was my heart? My heart was in Afghanistan. Day after day, when I listened to the news, when I followed what was going on with my country, my heart was breaking up. I really wanted to go back to my country, but at the same time I knew I could not go there, because there was no place for me. I had a good job. I was a professor at a university. I earned good money. I had a good life. My family was here. I could live with them. But I wasn't happy. I wanted to go back home. So I went to the refugee camp. And when I went to the refugee camp in Pakistan, there were 7.5 million refugees. 7.5 million refugees. About 90 percent of them were women and children. Most of the men have been killed or they were in war. And you know, in the refugee camp, when I went day-to-day to do a survey, I found things you never could imagine. I saw a widow with five to eight children sitting there and weeping and not knowing what to do. I saw a young woman have no way to go anywhere, no education, no entertainment, no place to even live. I saw young men that had lost their father and their home, and they are supporting the family as a 10-to-12-year old boy \u2014 being the head of the household, trying to protect their sister and their mother and their children.So it was a very devastating situation. My heart was beating for my people, and I didn't know what to do. At that moment, we talk about momentum. At that moment, I felt, what can I do for these people? How could I help these people? I am one individual. What can I do for them?But at that moment, I knew that education changed my life. It transformed me. It gave me status. It gave me confidence. It gave me a career. It helped me to support my family, to bring my family to another country, to be safe. And I knew that at that moment that what I should give to my people is education and health, and that's what I went after.But do you think it was easy? No, because at that time, education was banned for girls, completely. And also, by Russia invading Afghanistan, people were not trusting anyone. It was very hard to come and say, \"I want to do this.\" Who am I? Somebody who comes from the United States. Somebody who got educated here. Did they trust me? Of course not.So I really needed to build the trust in this community. How am I going to do that? I went and surveyed and looked and looked. I asked. Finally, I found one man. He was 80 years old. He was a mullah. I went to his tent in the camp, and I asked him, \"I want to make you a teacher.\" And he looked at me, and he said, \"Crazy woman, crazy woman, how do you think I can be a teacher?\" And I told him, \"I will make you a teacher.\" Finally, he accepted my offer, and once I started a class in his compound, the word spread all over. In a matter of one year, we had 25 schools set up, 15,000 children going to school, and it was amazing.(Applause)Thank you. Thank you.But of course, we're doing all our work, we were giving teacher training. We were training women's rights, human rights, democracy, rule of law. We were giving all kinds of training. And one day, I tell you, one day I was in the office in Peshawar, Pakistan. All of a sudden, I saw my staff running to rooms and locking the doors and telling me, \"Run away, hide!\" And you know, as a leader, what do you do? You're scared. You know it's dangerous. You know your life is on the line. But as a leader, you have to hold it together. You have to hold it together and show strength. So I said, \"What's going on?\" And these people were pouring into my office. So I invited them to the office. They came, and there were nine of them \u2014 nine Taliban. They were the ugliest looking men you can ever see.(Laughter)Very mean-looking people, black clothes, black turban, and they pour into my office. And I invited them to have a seat and have tea. They said no. They are not going to drink tea. And of course, with the tone of voice they were using, it was very scary, but I was really shaking up. But also I was strong, holding myself up. And, of course, by that time, you know how I dress \u2014 I dress from head to toe in a black hijab. The only thing you could see, my eyes. They asked me, \"What are you doing? Don't you know that school is banned for girls? What are you doing here?\" And you know, I just looked at them, and I said, \"What school? Where is the school?\"(Laughter)(Applause)And they look at my face, and they said, \"You are teaching girls here.\" I said, \"This is a house of somebody. We have some students coming, and they are all learning Koran, Holy Book. And you know, Koran says that if you learn the Holy Book, the woman, they can be a good wife, and they can obey their husband.\"(Laughter)And I tell you one thing: that's the way you work with those people, and you know \u2014(Laughter)So by that time, they started speaking Pashto. They talked to each other, and they said, \"Let's go, leave her alone, she's OK.\" And you know, this time, I offered them tea again, and they took a sip and they left. By that time, my staff poured into my office. They were scared to death. They didn't know why they didn't kill me. They didn't know why they didn't take me away. But everybody was happy to see me. Very happy, and I was happy to be alive, of course.(Laughter)Of course, I was happy to be alive. But also, as we continuously gave training during the fall of the Taliban \u2014 of course during the Taliban there is another story. We went underground and we provided education for 80 schoolgirls, 3,000 students underground, and continuously we trained.With the fall of the Taliban, we went into the country, and we opened school after school. We opened women's learning center. We continuously opened clinics. We worked with mothers and children. We had reproductive health training. We had all kinds of training that you can imagine. I was very happy. I was delighted with the outcome of my work. And one day, with four trainers and one bodyguard, I was going up north of Kabul, and all of a sudden, again, I was stopped in the middle of the road by 19 young men. Rifles on their shoulders, they blocked the road. And I told my driver, \"What's going on?\" And the driver said, \"I don't know.\" He asked them. They said, \"We have nothing to do with you.\" They called my name. They said, \"We want her.\" My bodyguard got out, said, \"I can answer you. What do you want?\" They said, \"Nothing.\" They called my name. And by that time, the women are yelling and screaming inside the car. I am very shaken up, and I told myself, this is it. This time, we all are going to be killed. There is no doubt in my mind. But still, the moment comes, and you take strength from whatever you believe and whatever you do. It's in your heart. You believe in your worth, and you can walk on it.So I just hold myself on the side of the car. My leg was shaking, and I got outside. And I asked them, \"What can I do for you?\" You know what they said to me? They said, \"We know who you are. We know where you are going. Every day you go up north here and there. You train women, you teach them and also you give them an opportunity to have a job. You build their skills. How about us?\"(Laughter)(Applause)\"And you know, how about us? What are we going to do?\" I looked at them, and I said, \"I don't know.\"(Laughter)They said, \"It's OK. The only thing we can do, what we know, from the time we're born, we just hold the gun and kill. That's all we know.\" And you know what that means. It's a trap to me, of course. So I walk out of there. They said, \"We'll let you go, go.\" And so I walked into the car, I sit in the car, and I told the driver, \"Turn around and go back to the office.\" At that time, we only were supporting girls. We only had money for women to train them, to send them to school, and nothing else.By the time I came to the office, of course my trainers were gone. They ran away home. Nobody stayed there. My bodyguard was the only one there, and my voice was completely gone. I was shaken up, and I sat on my table, and I said, \"What am I going to do?\" How am I going to solve this problem? Because we had training going on up north already. Hundreds of women were there coming to get training.So I was sitting there, all of a sudden, at this moment, talking about momentum, we are, at that moment, one of my wonderful donors called me about a report. And she asked me, \"Sakena?\" And I answered her. She said, \"It's not you. What's wrong with you?\" I said, \"Nothing.\" I tried to cover. No matter what I tried to do, she didn't believe me, and she asked me again. \"OK, tell me what's going on?\" I told her the whole story. At that time, she said, \"OK, you go next time, and you will help them. You will help them.\" And when, two days later, I went the same route, and do you know, they were not in here, they were a little back further, the same young men, standing up there and holding the rifle and pointing to us to stop the car. So we stopped the car. I got out. I said, \"OK, let's go with me.\" And they said, \"Yes.\" I said, \"On one condition, that whatever I say, you accept it.\" And they said, yes, they do. So I took them to the mosque, and to make a long story short, I told them I'd give them teachers. Today, they are the best trainers. They learn English, they learn how to be teachers, they learn computers, and they are my guides. Every area that is unknown to us in the mountain areas, they go with me. They are ahead, and we go. And they protect us. And \u2014(Applause)Thank you.(Applause)That tells you that education transforms people. When you educate people, they are going to be different, and today all over, we need to work for gender equality. We cannot only train women but forget about the men, because the men are the real people who are giving women the hardest time.(Laughter)So we started training men because the men should know the potential of women, know how much these potential men has, and how much these women can do the same job they are doing. So we are continuously giving training to men, and I really believe strongly. I live in a country that was a beautiful country. I just want to share this with you. It was a beautiful country, beautiful, peaceful country. We were going everywhere. Women were getting education: lawyer, engineer, teacher, and we were going from house to house. We never locked our doors. But you know what happened to my country. Today, people cannot walk out of their door without security issues. But we want the same Afghanistan we had before. And I want to tell you the other side. Today, the women of Afghanistan are working very, very hard. They are earning degrees. They are training to be lawyers. They are training to be doctors, back again. They are training to be teachers, and they are running businesses. So it is so wonderful to see people like that reach their complete potential, and all of this is going to happen.I want to share this with you, because of love, because of compassion, and because of trust and honesty. If you have these few things with you, you will accomplish. We have one poet, Mawl\u0101n\u0101 R\u016bm\u012b. He said that by having compassion and having love, you can conquer the world. And I tell you, we could. And if we could do it in Afghanistan, I am sure 100 percent that everyone can do it in any part of the world.Thank you very, very much.(Applause)Thank you. Thank you.(Applause)", "id": 2337, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:13.304 --> 00:00:16.933\n(Arabic) I seek refuge in Allah from cursed Satan.\nIn the

Nobody stayed there.\n\n00:12:26.372 --> 00:12:28.872\nMy bodyguard was the only one there,\n\n00:12:29.348 --> 00:12:32.054\nand my voice was completely gone.\n\n00:12:32.078 --> 00:12:35.213\nI was shaken up, and I sat on my table,\n\n00:12:35.237 --> 00:12:37.245\nand I said, \"What am I going to do?\"\n\n00:12:37.785 --> 00:12:40.261\nHow am I going to solve this problem?\n\n00:12:40.285 --> 00:12:43.689\nBecause we had training\ngoing on up north already.\n\n00:12:44.038 --> 00:12:47.665\nHundreds of women were there\ncoming to get training.\n\n00:12:48.253 --> 00:12:52.006\nSo I was sitting there,\nall of a sudden, at this moment,\n\n00:12:52.030 --> 00:12:53.983\ntalking about momentum, we are,\n\n00:12:54.459 --> 00:12:56.340\nat that moment,\n\n00:12:56.364 --> 00:13:00.332\none of my wonderful donors\ncalled me about a report.\n\n00:13:01.165 --> 00:13:04.698\nAnd she asked me, \"Sakena?\"\nAnd I answered her.\n\n00:13:04.722 --> 00:13:07.070\nShe said, \"It's not you.\nWhat's wrong with you?\"\n\n00:13:07.094 --> 00:13:09.713\nI said, \"Nothing.\" I tried to cover.\n\n00:13:10.419 --> 00:13:13.275\nNo matter what I tried to do,\nshe didn't believe me,\n\n00:13:13.299 --> 00:13:14.950\nand she asked me again.\n\n00:13:14.974 --> 00:13:16.816\n\"OK, tell me what's going on?\"\n\n00:13:16.840 --> 00:13:18.878\nI told her the whole story.\n\n00:13:18.902 --> 00:13:23.553\nAt that time, she said, \"OK,\nyou go next time, and you will help them.\n\n00:13:24.180 --> 00:13:25.791\nYou will help them.\"\n\n00:13:26.100 --> 00:13:29.775\nAnd when, two days later,\nI went the same route,\n\n00:13:30.322 --> 00:13:32.815\nand do you know, they were not in here,\n\n00:13:32.839 --> 00:13:35.012\nthey were a little back further,\n\n00:13:35.036 --> 00:13:39.585\nthe same young men, standing up there\nand holding the rifle\n\n00:13:39.609 --> 00:13:41.915\nand pointing to us to stop the car.\n\n00:13:41.939 --> 00:13:43.663\nSo we stopped the car.\n\n00:13:43.687 --> 00:13:46.567\nI got out.

It's a show produced by murderers and shared around the world via the Internet. Their names have become familiar: James Foley, Steven Sotloff, David Haines, Alan Henning, Peter Kassig, Haruna Yukawa, Kenji Goto Jogo.Their beheadings by the Islamic State were barbaric, but if we think they were archaic, from a remote, obscure age, then we're wrong. They were uniquely modern, because the murderers acted knowing well that millions of people would tune in to watch.The headlines called them savages and barbarians, because the image of one man overpowering another, killing him with a knife to the throat, conforms to our idea of ancient, primitive practices, the polar opposite of our urban, civilized ways. We don't do things like that. But that's the irony. We think a beheading has nothing to do with us, even as we click on the screen to watch. But it is to do with us. The Islamic State beheadings are not ancient or remote. They're a global, 21st century event, a 21st century event that takes place in our living rooms, at our desks, on our computer screens. They're entirely dependent on the power of technology to connect us. And whether we like it or not, everyone who watches is a part of the show.And lots of people watch. We don't know exactly how many. Obviously, it's difficult to calculate. But a poll taken in the UK, for example, in August 2014, estimated that 1.2 million people had watched the beheading of James Foley in the few days after it was released. And that's just the first few days, and just Britain. A similar poll taken in the United States in November 2014 found that nine percent of those surveyed had watched beheading videos, and a further 23 percent had watched the videos but had stopped just before the death was shown. Nine percent may be a small minority of all the people who could watch, but it's still a very large crowd. And of course that crowd is growing all the time, because every week, every month, more people will keep downloading and keep watching.If we go back 11 years, before sites like YouTube and Facebook were born, it was a similar story. When innocent civilians like Daniel Pearl, Nick Berg, Paul Johnson, were beheaded, those videos were shown during the Iraq War.Nick Berg's beheading quickly became one of the most searched for items on the Internet. Within a day, it was the top search term across search engines like Google, Lycos, Yahoo. In the week after Nick Berg's beheading, these were the top 10 search terms in the United States. The Berg beheading video remained the most popular search term for a week, and it was the second most popular search term for the whole month of May, runner-up only to \"American Idol.\" The al-Qaeda-linked website that first showed Nick Berg's beheading had to close down within a couple of days due to overwhelming traffic to the site. One Dutch website owner said that his daily viewing figures rose from 300,000 to 750,000 every time a beheading in Iraq was shown. He told reporters 18 months later that it had been downloaded many millions of times, and that's just one website. A similar pattern was seen again and again when videos of beheadings were released during the Iraq War.Social media sites have made these images more accessible than ever before, but if we take another step back in history, we'll see that it was the camera that first created a new kind of crowd in our history of beheadings as public spectacle. As soon as the camera appeared on the scene, a full lifetime ago on June 17, 1939, it had an immediate and unequivocal effect.That day, the first film of a public beheading was created in France. It was the execution, the guillotining, of a German serial killer, Eugen Weidmann, outside the prison Saint-Pierre in Versailles. Weidmann was due to be executed at the crack of dawn, as was customary at the time, but his executioner was new to the job, and he'd underestimated how long it would take him to prepare. So Weidmann was executed at 4:30 in the morning, by which time on a June morning, there was enough light to take photographs, and a spectator in the crowd filmed the event, unbeknownst to the authorities. Several still photographs were taken as well, and you can still watch the film online today and look at the photographs. The crowd on the day of Weidmann's execution was called \"unruly\" and \"disgusting\" by the press, but that was nothing compared to the untold thousands of people who could now study the action over and over again, freeze-framed in every detail.The camera may have made these scenes more accessible than ever before, but it's not just about the camera. If we take a bigger leap back in history, we'll see that for as long as there have been public judicial executions and beheadings, there have been the crowds to see them. In London, as late as the early 19th century, there might be four or five thousand people to see a standard hanging. There could be 40,000 or 50,000 to see a famous criminal killed. And a beheading, which was a rare event in England at the time, attracted even more.In May 1820, five men known as the Cato Street Conspirators were executed in London for plotting to assassinate members of the British government. They were hung and then decapitated. It was a gruesome scene. Each man's head was hacked off in turn and held up to the crowd. And 100,000 people, that's 10,000 more than can fit into Wembley Stadium, had turned out to watch. The streets were packed. People had rented out windows and rooftops. People had climbed onto carts and wagons in the street. People climbed lamp posts. People had been known to have died in the crush on popular execution days.Evidence suggests that throughout our history of public beheadings and public executions, the vast majority of the people who come to see are either enthusiastic or, at best, unmoved. Disgust has been comparatively rare, and even when people are disgusted and are horrified, it doesn't always stop them from coming out all the same to watch.Perhaps the most striking example of the human ability to watch a beheading and remain unmoved and even be disappointed was the introduction in France in 1792 of the guillotine, that famous decapitation machine. To us in the 21st century, the guillotine may seem like a monstrous contraption, but to the first crowds who saw it, it was actually a disappointment. They were used to seeing long, drawn-out, torturous executions on the scaffold, where people were mutilated and burned and pulled apart slowly. To them, watching the guillotine in action, it was so quick, there was nothing to see. The blade fell, the head fell into a basket, out of sight immediately, and they called out, \"Give me back my gallows, give me back my wooden gallows.\"The end of torturous public judicial executions in Europe and America was partly to do with being more humane towards the criminal, but it was also partly because the crowd obstinately refused to behave in the way that they should. All too often, execution day was more like a carnival than a solemn ceremony.Today, a public judicial execution in Europe or America is unthinkable, but there are other scenarios that should make us cautious about thinking that things are different now and we don't behave like that anymore.Take, for example, the incidents of suicide baiting. This is when a crowd gathers to watch a person who has climbed to the top of a public building in order to kill themselves, and people in the crowd shout and jeer, \"Get on with it! Go on and jump!\" This is a well-recognized phenomenon. One paper in 1981 found that in 10 out of 21 threatened suicide attempts, there was incidents of suicide baiting and jeering from a crowd. And there have been incidents reported in the press this year. This was a very widely reported incident in Telford and Shropshire in March this year.And when it happens today, people take photographs and they take videos on their phones and they post those videos online. When it comes to brutal murderers who post their beheading videos, the Internet has created a new kind of crowd. Today, the action takes place in a distant time and place, which gives the viewer a sense of detachment from what's happening, a sense of separation. It's nothing to do with me. It's already happened. We are also offered an unprecedented sense of intimacy. Today, we are all offered front row seats. We can all watch in private, in our own time and space, and no one need ever know that we've clicked on the screen to watch.This sense of separation \u2014 from other people, from the event itself \u2014 seems to be key to understanding our ability to watch, and there are several ways in which the Internet creates a sense of detachment that seems to erode individual moral responsibility. Our activities online are often contrasted with real life, as though the things we do online are somehow less real. We feel less accountable for our actions when we interact online. There's a sense of anonymity, a sense of invisibility, so we feel less accountable for our behavior. The Internet also makes it far easier to stumble upon things inadvertently, things that we would usually avoid in everyday life. Today, a video can start playing before you even know what you're watching. Or you may be tempted to look at material that you wouldn't look at in everyday life or you wouldn't look at if you were with other people at the time. And when the action is pre-recorded and takes place in a distant time and space, watching seems like a passive activity. There's nothing I can do about it now. It's already happened.All these things make it easier as an Internet user for us to give in to our sense of curiosity about death, to push our personal boundaries, to test our sense of shock, to explore our sense of shock.But we're not passive when we watch. On the contrary, we're fulfilling the murderer's desire to be seen. When the victim of a decapitation is bound and defenseless, he or she essentially becomes a pawn in their killer's show. Unlike a trophy head that's taken in battle, that represents the luck and skill it takes to win a fight, when a beheading is staged, when it's essentially a piece of theater, the power comes from the reception the killer receives as he performs. In other words, watching is very much part of the event. The event no longer takes place in a single location at a certain point in time as it used to and as it may still appear to. Now the event is stretched out in time and place, and everyone who watches plays their part.We should stop watching, but we know we won't. History tells us we won't, and the killers know it too.Thank you.(Applause)Bruno Giussani: Thank you. Let me get this back. Thank you. Let's move here. While they install for the next performance, I want to ask you the question that probably many here have, which is how did you get interested in this topic?Frances Larson: I used to work at a museum called the Pitt Rivers Museum in Oxford, which was famous for its display of shrunken heads from South America. People used to say, \"Oh, the shrunken head museum, the shrunken head museum!\" And at the time, I was working on the history of scientific collections of skulls. I was working on the cranial collections, and it just struck me as ironic that here were people coming to see this gory, primitive, savage culture that they were almost fantasizing about and creating without really understanding what they were seeing, and all the while these vast \u2014 I mean hundreds of thousands of skulls in our museums, all across Europe and the States \u2014 were kind of upholding this Enlightenment pursuit of scientific rationality. So I wanted to kind of twist it round and say, \"Let's look at us.\" We're looking through the glass case at these shrunken heads. Let's look at our own history and our own cultural fascination with these things.

a horrifying, real-life drama\n\n00:00:22.078 --> 00:00:25.334\nthat's proved too fascinating to turn off.\n\n00:00:25.358 --> 00:00:28.054\nIt's a show produced by murderers\n\n00:00:28.078 --> 00:00:30.838\nand shared around the world\nvia the Internet.\n\n00:00:32.038 --> 00:00:34.494\nTheir names have become familiar:\n\n00:00:34.518 --> 00:00:41.414\nJames Foley, Steven Sotloff,\nDavid Haines, Alan Henning, Peter Kassig,\n\n00:00:41.438 --> 00:00:45.054\nHaruna Yukawa, Kenji Goto Jogo.\n\n00:00:45.078 --> 00:00:47.774\nTheir beheadings by the Islamic State\n\n00:00:47.798 --> 00:00:49.414\nwere barbaric,\n\n00:00:49.438 --> 00:00:52.358\nbut if we think they were archaic,\n\n00:00:53.238 --> 00:00:56.094\nfrom a remote, obscure age,\n\n00:00:56.118 --> 00:00:57.774\nthen we're wrong.\n\n00:00:57.798 --> 00:01:00.534\nThey were uniquely modern,\n\n00:01:00.558 --> 00:01:03.414\nbecause the murderers acted knowing well\n\n00:01:03.438 --> 00:01:06.118\nthat millions of people\nwould tune in to watch.\n\n00:01:07.638 --> 00:01:10.974\nThe headlines called them\nsavages and barbarians,\n\n00:01:10.998 --> 00:01:14.454\nbecause the image of one man\noverpowering another,\n\n00:01:14.478 --> 00:01:16.733\nkilling him with a knife to the throat,\n\n00:01:16.758 --> 00:01:21.054\nconforms to our idea\nof ancient, primitive practices,\n\n00:01:21.078 -->

--> 00:01:34.414\nWe think a beheading\nhas nothing to do with us,\n\n00:01:34.438 --> 00:01:37.278\neven as we click on the screen to watch.\n\n00:01:38.238 --> 00:01:40.118\nBut it is to do with us.\n\n00:01:41.798 --> 00:01:44.254\nThe Islamic State beheadings\n\n00:01:44.278 --> 00:01:46.974\nare not ancient or remote.\n\n00:01:46.998 --> 00:01:50.014\nThey're a global, 21st century

watches\nis a part of the show.\n\n00:02:09.238 --> 00:02:11.478\nAnd lots of people watch.\n\n00:02:13.518 --> 00:02:15.054\nWe don't know exactly how many.\n\n00:02:15.078 --> 00:02:17.734\nObviously, it's difficult to calculate.\n\n00:02:17.758 --> 00:02:23.414\nBut a poll taken in the UK,\nfor example, in August 2014,\n\n00:02:23.438 --> 00:02:28.278\nestimated that 1.2 million people\n\n00:02:29.278 --> 00:02:32.734\nhad watched the beheading of James Foley\n\n00:02:32.758 --> 00:02:35.398\nin the few days after it was released.\n\n00:02:36.558 --> 00:02:39.014\nAnd that's just the first few days,\n\n00:02:39.038 --> 00:02:40.238\nand just Britain.\n\n00:02:41.638 --> 00:02:44.054\nA similar poll taken in the United States\n\n00:02:44.078 --> 00:02:45.798\nin November 2014\n\n00:02:46.918 --> 00:02:49.654\nfound that nine percent of those surveyed\n\n00:02:49.678 --> 00:02:51.758\nhad watched beheading videos,\n\n00:02:52.478 --> 00:02:54.734\nand a further 23 percent\n\n00:02:54.758 --> 00:02:58.758\nhad watched the videos but had stopped\njust before the death was shown.\n\n00:03:00.678 --> 00:03:05.654\nNine percent may be a small minority\nof all the people who could watch,\n\n00:03:05.678 --> 00:03:08.734\nbut it's still a very large crowd.\n\n00:03:08.758 --> 00:03:11.494\nAnd of course that crowd\nis growing all the time,\n\n00:03:11.518 --> 00:03:13.654\nbecause every week, every month,\n\n00:03:13.678 --> 00:03:16.838\nmore people will keep downloading\nand keep watching.\n\n00:03:18.558 --> 00:03:20.494\nIf we go back 11 years,\n\n00:03:20.518 --> 00:03:23.974\nbefore sites like YouTube\nand Facebook were born,\n\n00:03:23.998 --> 00:03:25.734\nit was a similar story.\n\n00:03:25.758 --> 00:03:29.134\nWhen innocent civilians like Daniel Pearl,\n\n00:03:29.158 --> 00:03:33.094\nNick Berg, Paul Johnson, were beheaded,\n\n00:03:33.118 --> 00:03:36.734\nthose videos were shown\nduring the Iraq War.\n\n00:03:36.758 --> 00:03:38.414\nNick Berg's beheading\n\n00:03:38.438 --> 00:03:43.238\nquickly became one of the most\nsearched for items on the Internet.\n\n00:03:44.158 --> 00:03:47.174\nWithin a day, it was the top search term\n\n00:03:47.198 --> 00:03:52.294\nacross search engines\nlike Google, Lycos, Yahoo.\n\n00:03:52.318 --> 00:03:55.494\nIn the week after Nick Berg's beheading,\n\n00:03:55.518 --> 00:03:59.758\nthese were the top 10 search terms\nin the United States.\n\n00:04:00.838 --> 00:04:05.734\nThe Berg beheading video remained\nthe most popular search term for a week,\n\n00:04:05.758 --> 00:04:10.374\nand it was the second most popular\nsearch term for the whole month of May,\n\n00:04:10.398 --> 00:04:13.118\nrunner-up only to \"American Idol.\"\n\n00:04:14.598 --> 00:04:19.294\nThe al-Qaeda-linked website\nthat first showed Nick Berg's beheading\n\n00:04:19.318 --> 00:04:24.638\nhad to close down within a couple of days\ndue to overwhelming traffic to the site.\n\n00:04:25.558 --> 00:04:29.694\nOne Dutch website owner said\nthat his daily viewing figures\n\n00:04:29.718 --> 00:04:34.534\nrose from 300,000 to 750,000\n\n00:04:34.558 --> 00:04:37.518\nevery time a beheading in Iraq was shown.\n\n00:04:38.398 --> 00:04:41.534\nHe told reporters 18 months later\n\n00:04:41.558 --> 00:04:44.934\nthat it had been downloaded\nmany millions of times,\n\n00:04:44.958 --> 00:04:46.878\nand that's just one website.\n\n00:04:47.718 --> 00:04:50.214\nA similar pattern was seen again and again\n\n00:04:50.238 --> 00:04:54.878\nwhen videos of beheadings\nwere released during the Iraq War.\n\n00:04:56.838 --> 00:05:01.854\nSocial media sites have made these images\nmore accessible than ever before,\n\n00:05:01.878 --> 00:05:05.414\nbut if we take\nanother step back in history,\n\n00:05:05.438 --> 00:05:10.574\nwe'll see that it was the camera\nthat first created a new kind of crowd\n\n00:05:10.598 --> 00:05:14.774\nin our history of beheadings\nas public spectacle.\n\n00:05:14.798 --> 00:05:17.854\nAs soon as the camera\nappeared on the scene,\n\n00:05:17.878 --> 00:05:21.614\na full lifetime ago on June 17, 1939,\n\n00:05:21.638 --> 00:05:25.334\nit had an immediate\nand unequivocal effect.\n\n00:05:25.358 --> 00:05:30.478\nThat day, the first film of a public\nbeheading was created in France.\n\n00:05:31.638 --> 00:05:37.374\nIt was the execution, the guillotining,\nof a German serial killer, Eugen Weidmann,\n\n00:05:37.398 --> 00:05:40.118\noutside the prison\nSaint-Pierre in Versailles.\n\n00:05:42.198 --> 00:05:45.174\nWeidmann was due to be executed\nat the crack of dawn,\n\n00:05:45.198 --> 00:05:47.374\nas was customary at the time,\n\n00:05:47.398 --> 00:05:49.974\nbut his executioner was new to the job,\n\n00:05:49.998 --> 00:05:53.854\nand he'd underestimated\nhow long it would take him to prepare.\n\n00:05:53.878 --> 00:05:58.014\nSo Weidmann was executed\nat 4:30 in the morning,\n\n00:05:58.038 --> 00:06:00.414\nby which time on a June morning,\n\n00:06:00.438 --> 00:06:02.998\nthere was enough light\nto take photographs,\n\n00:06:03.838 --> 00:06:07.974\nand a spectator in the crowd\nfilmed the event,\n\n00:06:07.998 --> 00:06:10.974\nunbeknownst to the authorities.\n\n00:06:10.998 --> 00:06:15.294\nSeveral still photographs\nwere taken as well,\n\n00:06:15.318 --> 00:06:19.454\nand you can still watch\nthe film online today\n\n00:06:19.478 --> 00:06:21.598\nand look at the photographs.\n\n00:06:22.918 --> 00:06:26.334\nThe crowd on the day\nof Weidmann's execution\n\n00:06:26.358 --> 00:06:30.334\nwas called \"unruly\"\nand \"disgusting\" by the press,\n\n00:06:30.358 --> 00:06:34.534\nbut that was nothing compared\nto the untold thousands of people\n\n00:06:34.558 --> 00:06:37.174\nwho could now study the action\n\n00:06:37.198 --> 00:06:38.414\nover and over again,\n\n00:06:38.438 --> 00:06:40.718\nfreeze-framed in every detail.\n\n00:06:43.078 --> 00:06:47.934\nThe camera may have made these scenes\nmore accessible than ever before,\n\n00:06:47.958 --> 00:06:50.614\nbut it's not just about the camera.\n\n00:06:50.638 --> 00:06:53.054\nIf we take a bigger leap back in history,\n\n00:06:53.078 --> 00:06:55.254\nwe'll see that for as long\nas there have been\n\n00:06:55.278 --> 00:06:58.374\npublic judicial executions and beheadings,\n\n00:06:58.398 --> 00:07:00.478\nthere have been the crowds to see them.\n\n00:07:01.878 --> 00:07:05.014\nIn London, as late as\nthe early 19th century,\n\n00:07:05.038 --> 00:07:09.694\nthere might be four or five thousand\npeople to see a standard hanging.\n\n00:07:09.718 --> 00:07:14.038\nThere could be 40,000 or 50,000\nto see a famous criminal killed.\n\n00:07:15.038 --> 00:07:19.454\nAnd a beheading, which was\na rare event in England at the time,\n\n00:07:19.478 --> 00:07:20.798\nattracted even more.\n\n00:07:21.798 --> 00:07:24.158\nIn May 1820,\n\n00:07:24.878 --> 00:07:28.894\nfive men known as\nthe Cato Street Conspirators\n\n00:07:28.918 --> 00:07:31.054\nwere executed in London for plotting\n\n00:07:31.078 --> 00:07:33.678\nto assassinate members\nof the British government.\n\n00:07:34.398 --> 00:07:38.054\nThey were hung and then decapitated.\n\n00:07:38.078 --> 00:07:40.054\nIt was a gruesome scene.\n\n00:07:40.078 --> 00:07:44.454\nEach man's head was hacked off in turn\nand held up to the crowd.\n\n00:07:44.478 --> 00:07:46.654\nAnd 100,000 people,\n\n00:07:46.678 --> 00:07:50.294\nthat's 10,000 more than can fit\ninto Wembley Stadium,\n\n00:07:50.318 --> 00:07:52.254\nhad turned out to watch.\n\n00:07:52.278 --> 00:07:54.534\nThe streets were packed.\n\n00:07:54.558 --> 00:07:58.774\nPeople had rented out\nwindows and rooftops.\n\n00:07:58.798 --> 00:08:01.814\nPeople had climbed onto carts\nand wagons in the street.\n\n00:08:01.838 --> 00:08:03.934\nPeople climbed lamp posts.\n\n00:08:03.958 --> 00:08:08.758\nPeople had been known to have died\nin the crush on popular execution days.\n\n00:08:10.078 --> 00:08:13.494\nEvidence suggests\nthat throughout our history\n\n00:08:13.518 --> 00:08:16.854\nof public beheadings\nand public executions,\n\n00:08:16.878 --> 00:08:20.214\nthe vast majority of the people\nwho come to see\n\n00:08:20.238 --> 00:08:24.438\nare either enthusiastic\nor, at best, unmoved.\n\n00:08:25.478 --> 00:08:29.094\nDisgust has been comparatively rare,\n\n00:08:29.118 --> 00:08:33.334\nand even when people\nare disgusted and are horrified,\n\n00:08:33.358 --> 00:08:37.398\nit doesn't always stop them\nfrom coming out all the same to watch.\n\n00:08:38.558 --> 00:08:41.774\nPerhaps the most striking example\n\n00:08:41.798 --> 00:08:47.093\nof the human ability to watch\na beheading and remain unmoved\n\n00:08:47.117 --> 00:08:49.454\nand even be disappointed\n\n00:08:49.478 --> 00:08:54.934\nwas the introduction in France\nin 1792 of the guillotine,\n\n00:08:54.958 --> 00:08:58.174\nthat famous decapitation machine.\n\n00:08:58.198 --> 00:09:00.814\nTo us in the 21st century,\n\n00:09:00.838 --> 00:09:04.334\nthe guillotine may seem\nlike a monstrous contraption,\n\n00:09:04.358 --> 00:09:09.518\nbut to the first crowds who saw it,\nit was actually a disappointment.\n\n00:09:10.838 --> 00:09:17.374\nThey were used to seeing long, drawn-out,\ntorturous executions on the scaffold,\n\n00:09:17.398 --> 00:09:22.854\nwhere people were mutilated\nand burned and pulled apart slowly.\n\n00:09:22.878 --> 00:09:25.854\nTo them, watching\nthe guillotine in action,\n\n00:09:25.878 --> 00:09:29.054\nit was so quick, there was nothing to see.\n\n00:09:29.078 --> 00:09:34.294\nThe blade fell, the head fell\ninto a basket, out of sight immediately,\n\n00:09:34.318 --> 00:09:36.014\nand they called out,\n\n00:09:36.038 --> 00:09:39.878\n\"Give me back my gallows,\ngive me back my wooden gallows.\"\n\n00:09:41.318 --> 00:09:46.494\nThe end of torturous public\njudicial executions in Europe and America\n\n00:09:46.518 --> 00:09:50.454\nwas partly to do with being\nmore humane towards the criminal,\n\n00:09:50.478 --> 00:09:55.214\nbut it was also partly because the crowd\nobstinately refused to behave\n\n00:09:55.238 --> 00:09:57.494\nin the way that they should.\n\n00:09:57.518 --> 00:09:59.854\nAll too often, execution day\n\n00:09:59.878 --> 00:10:03.038\nwas more like a carnival\nthan a solemn ceremony.\n\n00:10:04.478 --> 00:10:09.294\nToday, a public judicial execution\nin Europe or America is unthinkable,\n\n00:10:09.318 --> 00:10:12.054\nbut there are other scenarios\nthat should make us cautious\n\n00:10:12.078 --> 00:10:14.134\nabout thinking\nthat things are different now\n\n00:10:14.158 --> 00:10:16.478\nand we don't behave like that anymore.\n\n00:10:17.518 --> 00:10:22.134\nTake, for example,\nthe incidents of suicide baiting.\n\n00:10:22.158 --> 00:10:24.334\nThis is when a crowd gathers\n\n00:10:24.358 --> 00:10:27.974\nto watch a person who has climbed\nto the top of a public building\n\n00:10:27.998 --> 00:10:30.414\nin order to kill themselves,\n\n00:10:30.438 --> 00:10:33.414\nand people in the crowd shout and jeer,\n\n00:10:33.438 --> 00:10:35.518\n\"Get on with it! Go on and jump!\"\n\n00:10:36.558 --> 00:10:40.054\nThis is a well-recognized phenomenon.\n\n00:10:40.078 --> 00:10:46.334\nOne paper in 1981 found that in 10\nout of 21 threatened suicide attempts,\n\n00:10:46.358 --> 00:10:51.214\nthere was incidents of suicide baiting\nand jeering from a crowd.\n\n00:10:51.238 --> 00:10:56.814\nAnd there have been incidents\nreported in the press this year.\n\n00:10:56.838 --> 00:10:59.614\nThis was a very widely reported incident\n\n00:10:59.638 --> 00:11:02.614\nin Telford and Shropshire\nin March this year.\n\n00:11:02.638 --> 00:11:04.254\nAnd when it happens today,\n\n00:11:04.278 --> 00:11:07.694\npeople take photographs\nand they take videos on their phones\n\n00:11:07.718 --> 00:11:09.918\nand they post those videos online.\n\n00:11:12.078 --> 00:11:15.774\nWhen it comes to brutal murderers\nwho post their beheading videos,\n\n00:11:15.798 --> 00:11:19.494\nthe Internet has created\na new kind of crowd.\n\n00:11:19.518 --> 00:11:24.534\nToday, the action takes place\nin a distant time and place,\n\n00:11:24.558 --> 00:11:27.854\nwhich gives the viewer a sense\nof detachment from what's happening,\n\n00:11:27.878 --> 00:11:29.134\na sense of separation.\n\n00:11:29.158 --> 00:11:30.894\nIt's nothing to do with me.\n\n00:11:30.918 --> 00:11:32.198\nIt's already

00:11:50.454\nThis sense of separation --\n\n00:11:50.478 --> 00:11:53.454\nfrom other people,\nfrom the event itself --\n\n00:11:53.478 --> 00:11:57.054\nseems to be key to understanding\nour ability to watch,\n\n00:11:57.078 --> 00:11:58.334\nand there are several ways\n\n00:11:58.358 --> 00:12:01.614\nin which the Internet\ncreates a sense of detachment\n\n00:12:01.638 --> 00:12:05.238\nthat seems to erode\nindividual moral responsibility.\n\n00:12:06.638 --> 00:12:10.334\nOur activities online\nare often contrasted with real life,\n\n00:12:10.358 --> 00:12:13.438\nas though the things we do online\nare somehow less real.\n\n00:12:14.238 --> 00:12:17.214\nWe feel less accountable for our actions\n\n00:12:17.238 --> 00:12:20.574\nwhen we interact online.\n\n00:12:20.598 --> 00:12:24.694\nThere's a sense of anonymity,\na sense of invisibility,\n\n00:12:24.718 --> 00:12:27.358\nso we feel less accountable\nfor our behavior.\n\n00:12:28.758 --> 00:12:33.374\nThe Internet also makes it far easier\nto stumble upon things inadvertently,\n\n00:12:33.398 --> 00:12:37.014\nthings that we would usually avoid\nin everyday life.\n\n00:12:37.038 --> 00:12:41.894\nToday, a video can start playing\nbefore you even know what you're watching.\n\n00:12:41.918 --> 00:12:45.934\nOr you may be tempted to look at material\nthat you wouldn't look at in everyday life\n\n00:12:45.958 --> 00:12:49.078\nor you wouldn't look at if you\nwere with other people at the time.\n\n00:12:50.078 --> 00:12:52.974\nAnd when the action is pre-recorded\n\n00:12:52.998 --> 00:12:57.214\nand takes place\nin a distant time and space,\n\n00:12:57.238 --> 00:13:01.214\nwatching seems like a passive activity.\n\n00:13:01.238 --> 00:13:03.048\nThere's nothing I can do about it now.\n\n00:13:03.078 --> 00:13:04.628\nIt's already happened.\n\n00:13:05.118 --> 00:13:08.414\nAll these things make it easier\nas an Internet user\n\n00:13:08.438 --> 00:13:12.254\nfor us to give in to our sense\nof curiosity about death,\n\n00:13:12.278 --> 00:13:14.974\nto push our personal boundaries,\n\n00:13:14.998 --> 00:13:19.918\nto test our sense of shock,\nto explore our sense of shock.\n\n00:13:21.318 --> 00:13:23.654\nBut we're not passive when we watch.\n\n00:13:23.678 --> 00:13:28.174\nOn the contrary, we're fulfilling\nthe murderer's desire to be seen.\n\n00:13:28.198 --> 00:13:32.654\nWhen the victim of a decapitation\nis bound and defenseless,\n\n00:13:32.678 --> 00:13:37.158\nhe or she essentially becomes\na pawn in their killer's show.\n\n00:13:38.478 --> 00:13:41.334\nUnlike a trophy head\nthat's taken in battle,\n\n00:13:41.358 --> 00:13:45.678\nthat represents the luck and skill\nit takes to win a fight,\n\n00:13:47.158 --> 00:13:49.294\nwhen a beheading is staged,\n\n00:13:49.318 --> 00:13:52.254\nwhen it's essentially a piece of theater,\n\n00:13:52.278 --> 00:13:57.758\nthe power comes from the reception\nthe killer receives as he performs.\n\n00:13:58.838 --> 00:14:03.574\nIn other words, watching\nis very much part of the event.\n\n00:14:03.598 --> 00:14:07.134\nThe event no longer takes place\nin a single location\n\n00:14:07.158 --> 00:14:12.318\nat a certain point in time as it used to\nand as it may still appear to.\n\n00:14:13.158 --> 00:14:17.094\nNow the event is stretched out\nin time and place,\n\n00:14:17.118 --> 00:14:20.078\nand everyone who watches plays their part.\n\n00:14:21.478 --> 00:14:23.358\nWe should stop watching,\n\n00:14:24.078 --> 00:14:25.638\nbut we know we won't.\n\n00:14:26.398 --> 00:14:28.854\nHistory tells us we won't,\n\n00:14:28.878 --> 00:14:30.478\nand the killers know it too.\n\n00:14:31.198 --> 00:14:32.414\nThank you.\n\n00:14:32.438 -->

It started early. I grew up in the west of Ireland, wedged between four brothers, two older than me and two younger than me. So of course I had to be interested in human rights, and equality and justice, and using my elbows!(Laughter)And those issues stayed with me and guided me, and in particular, when I was elected the first woman President of Ireland, from 1990 to 1997. I dedicated my presidency to having a space for those who felt marginalized on the island of Ireland, and bringing together communities from Northern Ireland with those from the Republic, trying to build peace. And I went as the first Irish president to the United Kingdom and met with Queen Elizabeth II, and also welcomed to my official residence \u2014 which we call \"\u00c1ras an Uachtar\u00e1in,\" the house of the president \u2014 members of the royal family, including, notably, the Prince of Wales. And I was aware that at the time of my presidency, Ireland was a country beginning a rapid economic progress. We were a country that was benefiting from the solidarity of the European Union. Indeed, when Ireland first joined the European Union in 1973, there were parts of the country that were considered developing, including my own beloved native county, County Mayo. I led trade delegations here to the United States, to Japan, to India, to encourage investment, to help to create jobs, to build up our economy, to build up our health system, our education \u2014 our development.What I didn't have to do as president was buy land on mainland Europe, so that Irish citizens could go there because our island was going underwater. What I didn't have to think about, either as president or as a constitutional lawyer, was the implications for the sovereignty of the territory because of the impact of climate change. But that is what President Tong, of the Republic of Kiribati, has to wake up every morning thinking about. He has bought land in Fiji as an insurance policy, what he calls, \"migration with dignity,\" because he knows that his people may have to leave their islands. As I listened to President Tong describing the situation, I really felt that this was a problem that no leader should have to face. And as I heard him speak about the pain of his problems, I thought about Eleanor Roosevelt. I thought about her and those who worked with her on the Commission on Human Rights, which she chaired in 1948, and drew up the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. For them, it would have been unimaginable that a whole country could go out of existence because of human-induced climate change.I came to climate change not as a scientist or an environmental lawyer, and I wasn't really impressed by the images of polar bears or melting glaciers. It was because of the impact on people, and the impact on their rights \u2014 their rights to food and safe water, health, education and shelter. And I say this with humility, because I came late to the issue of climate change. When I served as UN High Commissioner for Human Rights from 1997 to 2002, climate change wasn't at the front of my mind. I don't remember making a single speech on climate change. I knew that there was another part of the United Nations \u2014 the UN Convention on Climate Change \u2014 that was dealing with the issue of climate change. It was later when I started to work in African countries on issues of development and human rights. And I kept hearing this pervasive sentence: \"Oh, but things are so much worse now, things are so much worse.\" And then I explored what was behind that; it was about changes in the climate \u2014 climate shocks, changes in the weather.I met Constance Okollet, who had formed a women's group in Eastern Uganda, and she told me that when she was growing up, she had a very normal life in her village and they didn't go hungry, they knew that the seasons would come as they were predicted to come, they knew when to sow and they knew when to harvest, and so they had enough food. But, in recent years, at the time of this conversation, they had nothing but long periods of drought, and then flash flooding, and then more drought. The school had been destroyed, livelihoods had been destroyed, their harvest had been destroyed. She forms this women's group to try to keep her community together. And this was a reality that really struck me, because of course, Constance Okollet wasn't responsible for the greenhouse gas emissions that were causing this problem.Indeed, I was very struck about the situation in Malawi in January of this year. There was an unprecedented flooding in the country, it covered about a third of the country, over 300 people were killed, and hundreds of thousands lost their livelihoods. And the average person in Malawi emits about 80 kg of CO2 a year. The average US citizen emits about 17.5 metric tons. So those who are suffering disproportionately don't drive cars, don't have electricity, don't consume very significantly, and yet they are feeling more and more the impacts of the changes in the climate, the changes that are preventing them from knowing how to grow food properly, and knowing how to look after their future. I think it was really the importance of the injustice that really struck me very forcibly.And I know that we're not able to address some of that injustice because we're not on course for a safe world. Governments around the world agreed at the conference in Copenhagen, and have repeated it at every conference on climate, that we have to stay below two degrees Celsius of warming above pre-Industrial standards. But we're on course for about four degrees. So we face an existential threat to the future of our planet. And that made me realize that climate change is the greatest threat to human rights in the 21st century.And that brought me then to climate justice. Climate justice responds to the moral argument \u2014 both sides of the moral argument \u2014 to address climate change. First of all, to be on the side of those who are suffering most and are most effected. And secondly, to make sure that they're not left behind again, when we start to move and start to address climate change with climate action, as we are doing.In our very unequal world today, it's very striking how many people are left behind. In our world of 7.2 billion people, about 3 billion are left behind. 1.3 billion don't have access to electricity, and they light their homes with kerosene and candles, both of which are dangerous. And in fact they spend a lot of their tiny income on that form of lighting. 2.6 billion people cook on open fires \u2014 on coal, wood and animal dung. And this causes about 4 million deaths a year from indoor smoke inhalation, and of course, most of those who die are women. So we have a very unequal world, and we need to change from \"business as usual.\" And we shouldn't underestimate the scale and the transformative nature of the change which will be needed, because we have to go to zero carbon emissions by about 2050, if we're going to stay below two degrees Celsius of warming. And that means we have to leave about two-thirds of the known resources of fossil fuels in the ground.It's a very big change, and it means that obviously, industrialized countries must cut their emissions, must become much more energy-efficient, and must move as quickly as possible to renewable energy. For developing countries and emerging economies, the problem and the challenge is to grow without emissions, because they must develop; they have very poor populations. So they must develop without emissions, and that is a different kind of problem. Indeed, no country in the world has actually grown without emissions. All the countries have developed with fossil fuels, and then may be moving to renewable energy. So it is a very big challenge, and it requires the total support of the international community, with the necessary finance and technology, and systems and support, because no country can make itself safe from the dangers of climate change. This is an issue that requires complete human solidarity. Human solidarity, if you like, based on self-interest \u2014 because we are all in this together, and we have to work together to ensure that we reach zero carbon by 2050.The good news is that change is happening, and it's happening very fast. Here in California, there's a very ambitious emissions target to cut emissions. In Hawaii, they're passing legislation to have 100 percent renewable energy by 2045. And governments are very ambitious around the world. In Costa Rica, they have committed to being carbon-neutral by 2021. In Ethiopia, the commitment is to be carbon-neutral by 2027. Apple have pledged that their factories in China will use renewable energy. And there is a race on at the moment to convert electricity from tidal and wave power, in order that we can leave the coal in the ground. And that change is both welcome and is happening very rapidly. But it's still not enough, and the political will is still not enough.Let me come back to President Tong and his people in Kiribati. They actually could be able to live on their island and have a solution, but it would take a lot of political will. President Tong told me about his ambitious idea to either build up or even float the little islands where his people live. This, of course, is beyond the resources of Kiribati itself. It would require great solidarity and support from other countries, and it would require the kind of imaginative idea that we bring together when we want to have a space station in the air. But wouldn't it be wonderful to have this engineering wonder and to allow a people to remain in their sovereign territory, and be part of the community of nations? That is the kind of idea that we should be thinking about. Yes, the challenges of the transformation we need are big, but they can be solved. We are actually, as a people, very capable of coming together to solve problems.I was very conscious of this as I took part this year in commemoration of the 70th anniversary of the end of the Second World War in 1945. 1945 was an extraordinary year. It was a year when the world faced what must have seemed almost insoluble problems \u2014 the devastation of the world wars, particularly the Second World War; the fragile peace that had been brought about; the need for a whole economic regeneration. But the leaders of that time didn't flinch from this. They had the capacity, they had a sense of being driven by never again must the world have this kind of problem. And they had to build structures for peace and security. And what did we get? What did they achieve? The Charter of the United Nations, the Bretton Woods institutions, as they're called, The World Bank, and the International Monetary Fund. A Marshall Plan for Europe, a devastated Europe, to reconstruct it. And indeed a few years later, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.2015 is a year that is similar in its importance to 1945, with similar challenges and similar potential. There will be two big summits this year: the first one, in September in New York, is the summit for the sustainable development goals. And then the summit in Paris in December, to give us a climate agreement. The sustainable development goals are intended to help countries to live sustainably, in tune with Mother Earth, not to take out of Mother Earth and destroy ecosystems, but rather, to live in harmony with Mother Earth, by living under sustainable development. And the sustainable development goals will come into operation for all countries on January 1, 2016. The climate agreement \u2014 a binding climate agreement \u2014 is needed because of the scientific evidence that we're on a trajectory for about a four-degree world and we have to change course to stay below two degrees. So we need to take steps that will be monitored and reviewed, so that we can keep increasing the ambition of how we cut emissions, and how we move more rapidly to renewable energy, so that we have a safe world.The reality is that this issue is much too important to be left to politicians and to the United Nations.(Laughter)It's an issue for all of us, and it's an issue where we need more and more momentum. Indeed, the face of the environmentalist has changed, because of the justice dimension. It's now an issue for faith-based organizations, under very good leadership from Pope Francis, and indeed, the Church of England, which is divesting from fossil fuels. It's an issue for the business community, and the good news is that the business community is changing very rapidly \u2014 except for the fossil fuel industries \u2014(Laughter)Even they are beginning to slightly change their language \u2014 but only slightly. But business is not only moving rapidly to the benefits of renewable energy, but is urging politicians to give them more signals, so that they can move even more rapidly. It's an issue for the trade union movement. It's an issue for the women's movement. It's an issue for young people.I was very struck when I learned that Jibreel Khazan, one of the Greensboro Four who had taken part in the Woolworth sit-ins, said quite recently that climate change is the lunch counter moment for young people. So, lunch counter moment for young people of the 21st century \u2014 the sort of real human rights issue of the 21st century, because he said it is the greatest challenge to humanity and justice in our world.I recall very much the Climate March last September, and that was a huge momentum, not just in New York, but all around the world. and we have to build on that. I was marching with some of The Elders family, and I saw a placard a little bit away from me, but we were wedged so closely together \u2014 because after all, there were 400,000 people out in the streets of New York \u2014 so I couldn't quite get to that placard, I would have just liked to have been able to step behind it, because it said, \"Angry Grannies!\"(Laughter)That's what I felt. And I have five grandchildren now, I feel very happy as an Irish grandmother to have five grandchildren, and I think about their world, and what it will be like when they will share that world with about 9 billion other people in 2050. We know that inevitably it will be a climate-constrained world, because of the emissions we've already put up there, but it could be a world that is much more equal and much fairer, and much better for health, and better for jobs and better for energy security, than the world we have now, if we have switched sufficiently and early enough to renewable energy, and no one is left behind. No one is left behind.And just as we've been looking back this year \u2014 in 2015 to 1945, looking back 70 years \u2014 I would like to think that they will look back, that world will look back 35 years from 2050, 35 years to 2015, and that they will say, \"Weren't they good to do what they did in 2015? We really appreciate that they took the decisions that made a difference, and that put the world on the right pathway, and we benefit now from that pathway,\" that they will feel that somehow we took our responsibilities, we did what was done in 1945 in similar terms, we didn't miss the opportunity, we lived up to our responsibilities. That's what this year is about.And somehow for me, it's captured in words of somebody that I admired very much. She was a mentor of mine, she was a friend, she died much too young, she was an extraordinary personality, a great champion of the environment: Wangari Maathai. Wangari said once, \"In the course of history, there comes a time when humanity is called upon to shift to a new level of consciousness, to reach a higher moral ground.\" And that's what we have to do. We have to reach a new level of consciousness, a higher moral ground. And we have to do it this year in those two big summits. And that won't happen unless we have the momentum from people around the world who say: \"We want action now, we want to change course, we want a safe world, a safe world for future generations, a safe world for our children and our grandchildren, and we're all in this together.\"Thank you.(Applause)", "id": 2331, "subtitle":

00:00:41.393\nand equality and justice,\n\n00:00:41.417 --> 00:00:43.138\nand using my elbows!\n\n00:00:43.162 --> 00:00:44.975\n(Laughter)\n\n00:00:44.999 --> 00:00:47.988\nAnd those issues stayed\nwith me and guided me,\n\n00:00:48.012 --> 00:00:49.638\nand in particular,\n\n00:00:49.662 --> 00:00:54.212\nwhen I was elected the first\nwoman President of Ireland,\n\n00:00:54.236 --> 00:00:57.132\nfrom 1990 to 1997.\n\n00:00:57.497 --> 00:01:00.014\nI dedicated my presidency\n\n00:01:00.038 --> 00:01:05.495\nto having a space for those who felt\nmarginalized on the island of Ireland,\n\n00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:08.248\nand bringing together communities\nfrom Northern Ireland\n\n00:01:08.272 --> 00:01:10.012\nwith those from the Republic,\n\n00:01:10.036 --> 00:01:11.986\ntrying to build peace.\n\n00:01:12.423 --> 00:01:17.673\nAnd I went as the first Irish president\nto the United Kingdom\n\n00:01:17.697 --> 00:01:20.683\nand met with Queen Elizabeth II,\n\n00:01:20.707 --> 00:01:24.515\nand also welcomed to my\nofficial residence --\n\n00:01:24.539 --> 00:01:28.318\nwhich we call \"\u00c1ras an Uachtar\u00e1in,\"\nthe house of the president --\n\n00:01:28.342 --> 00:01:30.588\nmembers of the royal family,\n\n00:01:30.612 --> 00:01:33.392\nincluding, notably, the Prince of Wales.\n\n00:01:33.904 --> 00:01:40.266\nAnd I was aware that at the time\nof my presidency,\n\n00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:45.262\nIreland was a country beginning\na rapid economic progress.\n\n00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:52.498\nWe were a country that was benefiting\nfrom the solidarity of the European Union.\n\n00:01:53.565 --> 00:01:58.569\nIndeed, when Ireland first joined\nthe European Union in 1973,\n\n00:01:58.593 --> 00:02:01.949\nthere were parts of the country\nthat were considered developing,\n\n00:02:01.973 --> 00:02:05.453\nincluding my own beloved\nnative county, County Mayo.\n\n00:02:06.521 --> 00:02:10.832\nI led trade delegations\nhere to the United States,\n\n00:02:10.856 --> 00:02:13.742\nto Japan, to India,\n\n00:02:13.766 --> 00:02:17.032\nto encourage investment,\nto help to create jobs,\n\n00:02:17.056 --> 00:02:18.382\nto build up our economy,\n\n00:02:18.406 --> 00:02:20.700\nto build up our health system,\nour education --\n\n00:02:20.724 --> 00:02:22.065\nour development.\n\n00:02:22.914 --> 00:02:25.934\nWhat I didn't have to do as president\n\n00:02:25.958 --> 00:02:30.599\nwas buy land on mainland Europe,\n\n00:02:30.623 --> 00:02:36.859\nso that Irish citizens could go there\nbecause our island was going underwater.\n\n00:02:37.669 --> 00:02:39.299\nWhat I didn't have to think about,\n\n00:02:39.323 --> 00:02:41.998\neither as president\nor as a constitutional lawyer,\n\n00:02:42.022 --> 00:02:45.674\nwas the implications\nfor the sovereignty of the territory\n\n00:02:45.698 --> 00:02:48.291\nbecause of the impact of climate change.\n\n00:02:49.267 --> 00:02:54.038\nBut that is what President Tong,\nof the Republic of Kiribati,\n\n00:02:54.062 --> 00:02:56.813\nhas to wake up every morning\nthinking about.\n\n00:02:57.428 --> 00:03:02.686\nHe has bought land in Fiji\nas an insurance policy,\n\n00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:05.706\nwhat he calls, \"migration with dignity,\"\n\n00:03:06.495 --> 00:03:11.059\nbecause he knows that his people\nmay have to leave their islands.\n\n00:03:12.253 --> 00:03:17.341\nAs I listened to President Tong\ndescribing the situation,\n\n00:03:17.365 --> 00:03:23.736\nI really felt that this was a problem\nthat no leader should have to face.\n\n00:03:24.152 --> 00:03:29.918\nAnd as I heard him speak\nabout the pain of his problems,\n\n00:03:29.942 --> 00:03:32.338\nI thought about Eleanor Roosevelt.\n\n00:03:33.661 --> 00:03:38.037\nI thought about her\nand those who worked with her\n\n00:03:38.061 --> 00:03:43.139\non the Commission on Human Rights,\nwhich she chaired in 1948,\n\n00:03:43.163 --> 00:03:47.175\nand drew up the Universal\nDeclaration of Human Rights.\n\n00:03:47.994 --> 00:03:51.572\nFor them, it would have been unimaginable\n\n00:03:51.596 --> 00:03:56.230\nthat a whole country\ncould go out of existence\n\n00:03:56.254 --> 00:03:59.675\nbecause of human-induced climate change.\n\n00:03:59.699 --> 00:04:04.448\nI came to climate change not as\na scientist or an environmental lawyer,\n\n00:04:04.472 --> 00:04:08.431\nand I wasn't really impressed\nby the images of polar bears\n\n00:04:08.455 --> 00:04:10.065\nor melting glaciers.\n\n00:04:10.089 --> 00:04:13.613\nIt was because of the impact on people,\n\n00:04:13.962 --> 00:04:17.035\nand the impact on their rights --\n\n00:04:17.059 --> 00:04:22.190\ntheir rights to food and safe water,\nhealth, education and shelter.\n\n00:04:22.214 --> 00:04:26.591\nAnd I say this with humility,\n\n00:04:26.615 --> 00:04:30.550\nbecause I came late\nto the issue of climate change.\n\n00:04:30.852 --> 00:04:32.003\nWhen I served\n\n00:04:32.027 --> 00:04:34.027\nas UN High Commissioner for Human Rights\n\n00:04:34.051 --> 00:04:37.281\nfrom 1997 to 2002,\n\n00:04:37.305 --> 00:04:39.511\nclimate change wasn't\nat the front of my mind.\n\n00:04:39.535 --> 00:04:43.432\nI don't remember making\na single speech on climate change.\n\n00:04:43.456 --> 00:04:46.759\nI knew that there was another\npart of the United Nations --\n\n00:04:46.783 --> 00:04:48.941\nthe UN Convention on Climate Change --\n\n00:04:48.965 --> 00:04:52.686\nthat was dealing with\nthe issue of climate change.\n\n00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:57.070\nIt was later when I started\nto work in African countries\n\n00:04:57.094 --> 00:05:00.362\non issues of development and human rights.\n\n00:05:00.386 --> 00:05:03.648\nAnd I kept hearing\nthis pervasive sentence:\n\n00:05:03.672 --> 00:05:08.023\n\"Oh, but things are so much worse now,\nthings are so much worse.\"\n\n00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:11.826\nAnd then I explored what was behind that;\n\n00:05:11.850 --> 00:05:15.159\nit was about changes in the climate --\n\n00:05:15.183 --> 00:05:18.103\nclimate shocks, changes in the weather.\n\n00:05:18.817 --> 00:05:20.845\nI met Constance Okollet,\n\n00:05:20.869 --> 00:05:24.027\nwho had formed a women's group\nin Eastern Uganda,\n\n00:05:24.051 --> 00:05:26.678\nand she told me that\nwhen she was growing up,\n\n00:05:26.702 --> 00:05:31.035\nshe had a very normal life in her village\nand they didn't go hungry,\n\n00:05:31.059 --> 00:05:36.388\nthey knew that the seasons would come\nas they were predicted to come,\n\n00:05:36.412 --> 00:05:39.189\nthey knew when to sow\nand they knew when to harvest,\n\n00:05:39.213 --> 00:05:41.585\nand so they had enough food.\n\n00:05:41.966 --> 00:05:44.291\nBut, in recent years,\n\n00:05:44.315 --> 00:05:46.239\nat the time of this conversation,\n\n00:05:46.263 --> 00:05:49.493\nthey had nothing\nbut long periods of drought,\n\n00:05:49.517 --> 00:05:51.168\nand then flash flooding,\n\n00:05:51.192 --> 00:05:52.913\nand then more drought.\n\n00:05:53.238 --> 00:05:54.779\nThe school had been destroyed,\n\n00:05:54.803 --> 00:05:56.342\nlivelihoods had been destroyed,\n\n00:05:56.366 --> 00:05:58.140\ntheir harvest had been destroyed.\n\n00:05:58.164 --> 00:06:02.770\nShe forms this women's group\nto try to keep her community together.\n\n00:06:03.127 --> 00:06:08.287\nAnd this was a reality\nthat really struck me,\n\n00:06:08.311 --> 00:06:12.696\nbecause of course,\nConstance Okollet wasn't responsible\n\n00:06:12.720 --> 00:06:16.386\nfor the greenhouse gas emissions\nthat were causing this problem.\n\n00:06:16.767 --> 00:06:20.909\nIndeed, I was very struck\nabout the situation in Malawi\n\n00:06:20.933 --> 00:06:22.815\nin January of this year.\n\n00:06:22.839 --> 00:06:25.966\nThere was an unprecedented\nflooding in the country,\n\n00:06:25.990 --> 00:06:28.372\nit covered about a third of the country,\n\n00:06:28.396 --> 00:06:30.562\nover 300 people were killed,\n\n00:06:30.586 --> 00:06:33.879\nand hundreds of thousands\nlost their livelihoods.\n\n00:06:34.346 --> 00:06:37.442\nAnd the average person in Malawi\n\n00:06:37.466 --> 00:06:42.409\nemits about 80 kg of CO2 a year.\n\n00:06:43.124 --> 00:06:48.648\nThe average US citizen emits\nabout 17.5 metric tons.\n\n00:06:49.084 --> 00:06:52.775\nSo those who are suffering\ndisproportionately\n\n00:06:52.799 --> 00:06:59.640\ndon't drive cars, don't have electricity,\ndon't consume very significantly,\n\n00:06:59.664 --> 00:07:02.822\nand yet they are feeling more and more\n\n00:07:02.846 --> 00:07:07.235\nthe impacts of the changes in the climate,\n\n00:07:07.259 --> 00:07:11.528\nthe changes that are preventing them\nfrom knowing how to grow food properly,\n\n00:07:11.552 --> 00:07:15.171\nand knowing how\nto look after their future.\n\n00:07:15.472 --> 00:07:22.472\nI think it was really\nthe importance of the injustice\n\n00:07:22.989 --> 00:07:25.995\nthat really struck me very forcibly.\n\n00:07:26.019 --> 00:07:33.019\nAnd I know that we're not able\nto address some of that injustice\n\n00:07:33.094 --> 00:07:36.561\nbecause we're not on course\nfor a safe world.\n\n00:07:36.585 --> 00:07:42.974\nGovernments around the world agreed\nat the conference in Copenhagen,\n\n00:07:42.998 --> 00:07:46.712\nand have repeated it\nat every conference on climate,\n\n00:07:46.736 --> 00:07:50.196\nthat we have to stay\nbelow two degrees Celsius\n\n00:07:50.220 --> 00:07:53.607\nof warming above pre-Industrial standards.\n\n00:07:53.631 --> 00:07:56.543\nBut we're on course\nfor about four degrees.\n\n00:07:56.567 --> 00:08:01.440\nSo we face an existential threat\nto the future of our planet.\n\n00:08:01.464 --> 00:08:03.084\nAnd that made me realize\n\n00:08:03.108 --> 00:08:09.191\nthat climate change is the greatest threat\nto human rights in the 21st century.\n\n00:08:09.524 --> 00:08:13.159\nAnd that brought me then\nto climate justice.\n\n00:08:13.183 --> 00:08:17.342\nClimate justice responds\nto the moral argument --\n\n00:08:17.366 --> 00:08:19.398\nboth sides of the moral argument --\n\n00:08:19.422 --> 00:08:21.840\nto address climate change.\n\n00:08:21.864 --> 00:08:23.015\nFirst of all,\n\n00:08:23.039 --> 00:08:26.903\nto be on the side of those who are\nsuffering most and are most effected.\n\n00:08:27.252 --> 00:08:28.609\nAnd secondly,\n\n00:08:28.633 --> 00:08:33.634\nto make sure that they're not left behind\nagain, when we start to move\n\n00:08:33.658 --> 00:08:36.467\nand start to address climate change\nwith climate action,\n\n00:08:36.491 --> 00:08:38.013\nas we are doing.\n\n00:08:39.792 --> 00:08:42.586\nIn our very unequal world today,\n\n00:08:42.610 --> 00:08:46.189\nit's very striking how many\npeople are left behind.\n\n00:08:46.887 --> 00:08:52.895\nIn our world of 7.2 billion people,\nabout 3 billion are left behind.\n\n00:08:53.220 --> 00:08:57.633\n1.3 billion don't have access\nto electricity,\n\n00:08:57.657 --> 00:09:01.161\nand they light their homes\nwith kerosene and candles,\n\n00:09:01.185 --> 00:09:02.860\nboth of which are dangerous.\n\n00:09:02.884 --> 00:09:09.375\nAnd in fact they spend a lot of their\ntiny income on that form of lighting.\n\n00:09:09.399 --> 00:09:13.252\n2.6 billion people cook on open fires --\n\n00:09:13.752 --> 00:09:17.261\non coal, wood and animal dung.\n\n00:09:17.285 --> 00:09:21.959\nAnd this causes\nabout 4 million deaths a year\n\n00:09:21.983 --> 00:09:24.205\nfrom indoor smoke inhalation,\n\n00:09:24.229 --> 00:09:28.139\nand of course, most of those\nwho die are women.\n\n00:09:28.750 --> 00:09:32.591\nSo we have a very unequal world,\n\n00:09:33.004 --> 00:09:39.059\nand we need to change\nfrom \"business as usual.\"\n\n00:09:39.083 --> 00:09:45.147\nAnd we shouldn't underestimate\nthe scale and the transformative nature\n\n00:09:45.171 --> 00:09:47.908\nof the change which will be needed,\n\n00:09:47.932 --> 00:09:54.521\nbecause we have to go to zero\ncarbon emissions by about 2050,\n\n00:09:54.545 --> 00:09:58.910\nif we're going to stay below\ntwo degrees Celsius of warming.\n\n00:09:58.934 --> 00:10:03.934\nAnd that means we have to leave\nabout two-thirds of the known resources\n\n00:10:03.958 --> 00:10:06.165\nof fossil fuels in the ground.\n\n00:10:06.522 --> 00:10:08.245\nIt's a very big change,\n\n00:10:08.269 --> 00:10:10.801\nand it means that obviously,\n\n00:10:10.825 --> 00:10:13.467\nindustrialized countries\nmust cut their emissions,\n\n00:10:13.491 --> 00:10:15.562\nmust become much more energy-efficient,\n\n00:10:15.586 --> 00:10:19.522\nand must move as quickly as possible\nto renewable energy.\n\n00:10:20.157 --> 00:10:24.537\nFor developing countries\nand emerging economies,\n\n00:10:24.561 --> 00:10:29.118\nthe problem and the challenge\nis to grow without emissions,\n\n00:10:29.142 --> 00:10:32.456\nbecause they must develop;\nthey have very poor populations.\n\n00:10:32.480 --> 00:10:38.240\nSo they must develop without emissions,\nand that is a different kind of problem.\n\n00:10:38.548 --> 00:10:43.563\nIndeed, no country in the world\nhas actually grown without emissions.\n\n00:10:44.090 --> 00:10:46.494\nAll the countries have developed\nwith fossil fuels,\n\n00:10:46.518 --> 00:10:48.816\nand then may be moving\nto renewable energy.\n\n00:10:48.840 --> 00:10:51.179\nSo it is a very big challenge,\n\n00:10:51.203 --> 00:10:55.913\nand it requires the total support\nof the international community,\n\n00:10:55.937 --> 00:11:00.873\nwith the necessary finance and technology,\nand systems and support,\n\n00:11:00.897 --> 00:11:07.659\nbecause no country can make itself safe\nfrom the dangers of climate change.\n\n00:11:07.965 --> 00:11:12.613\nThis is an issue that requires\ncomplete human solidarity.\n\n00:11:13.264 --> 00:11:16.601\nHuman solidarity, if you like,\nbased on self-interest --\n\n00:11:16.625 --> 00:11:18.905\nbecause we are all in this together,\n\n00:11:18.929 --> 00:11:20.324\nand we have to work together\n\n00:11:20.348 --> 00:11:25.738\nto ensure that we reach\nzero carbon by 2050.\n\n00:11:26.633 --> 00:11:29.396\nThe good news is that change is happening,\n\n00:11:29.420 --> 00:11:31.324\nand it's happening very fast.\n\n00:11:32.089 --> 00:11:33.363\nHere in California,\n\n00:11:33.387 --> 00:11:37.393\nthere's a very ambitious\nemissions target to cut emissions.\n\n00:11:37.924 --> 00:11:40.729\nIn Hawaii, they're passing legislation\n\n00:11:40.753 --> 00:11:45.379\nto have 100 percent\nrenewable energy by 2045.\n\n00:11:45.689 --> 00:11:49.339\nAnd governments are very ambitious\naround the world.\n\n00:11:49.689 --> 00:11:54.356\nIn Costa Rica, they have committed\nto being carbon-neutral by 2021.\n\n00:11:55.068 --> 00:12:01.136\nIn Ethiopia, the commitment\nis to be carbon-neutral by 2027.\n\n00:12:01.879 --> 00:12:08.094\nApple have pledged that their factories\nin China will use renewable energy.\n\n00:12:08.398 --> 00:12:11.251\nAnd there is a race on at the moment\n\n00:12:11.275 --> 00:12:15.212\nto convert electricity\nfrom tidal and wave power,\n\n00:12:15.236 --> 00:12:19.455\nin order that we can leave\nthe coal in the ground.\n\n00:12:19.479 --> 00:12:24.302\nAnd that change is both welcome\nand is happening very rapidly.\n\n00:12:24.326 --> 00:12:25.711\nBut it's still not enough,\n\n00:12:25.735 --> 00:12:28.002\nand the political will\nis still not enough.\n\n00:12:28.433 --> 00:12:33.400\nLet me come back to President Tong\nand his people in Kiribati.\n\n00:12:34.035 --> 00:12:40.826\nThey actually could be able to live\non their island and have a solution,\n\n00:12:40.850 --> 00:12:43.071\nbut it would take a lot of political will.\n\n00:12:43.558 --> 00:12:47.706\nPresident Tong told me\nabout his ambitious idea\n\n00:12:47.730 --> 00:12:54.090\nto either build up or even float\nthe little islands where his people live.\n\n00:12:54.976 --> 00:12:59.042\nThis, of course, is beyond\nthe resources of Kiribati itself.\n\n00:12:59.383 --> 00:13:03.114\nIt would require great solidarity\nand support from other countries,\n\n00:13:03.138 --> 00:13:07.360\nand it would require\nthe kind of imaginative idea\n\n00:13:07.384 --> 00:13:11.937\nthat we bring together when we want\nto have a space station in the air.\n\n00:13:12.394 --> 00:13:17.249\nBut wouldn't it be wonderful\nto have this engineering wonder\n\n00:13:17.273 --> 00:13:20.806\nand to allow a people to remain\nin their sovereign territory,\n\n00:13:20.830 --> 00:13:23.949\nand be part of the community of nations?\n\n00:13:23.973 --> 00:13:28.756\nThat is the kind of idea\nthat we should be thinking about.\n\n00:13:29.639 --> 00:13:34.413\nYes, the challenges\nof the transformation we need are big,\n\n00:13:34.437 --> 00:13:36.985\nbut they can be solved.\n\n00:13:37.009 --> 00:13:39.040\nWe are actually, as a people,\n\n00:13:39.064 --> 00:13:42.358\nvery capable of coming together\nto solve problems.\n\n00:13:42.764 --> 00:13:46.398\nI was very conscious of this\nas I took part this year\n\n00:13:46.422 --> 00:13:50.179\nin commemoration of the 70th anniversary\n\n00:13:50.203 --> 00:13:54.868\nof the end of the Second\nWorld War in 1945.\n\n00:13:55.702 --> 00:13:58.303\n1945 was an extraordinary year.\n\n00:13:59.325 --> 00:14:01.931\nIt was a year when the world faced\n\n00:14:01.955 --> 00:14:05.482\nwhat must have seemed almost\ninsoluble problems --\n\n00:14:05.506 --> 00:14:10.055\nthe devastation of the world wars,\nparticularly the Second World War;\n\n00:14:10.079 --> 00:14:13.286\nthe fragile peace that had\nbeen brought about;\n\n00:14:13.310 --> 00:14:15.944\nthe need for a whole\neconomic regeneration.\n\n00:14:16.601 --> 00:14:20.826\nBut the leaders of that time\ndidn't flinch from this.\n\n00:14:20.850 --> 00:14:25.180\nThey had the capacity, they had\na sense of being driven by\n\n00:14:25.204 --> 00:14:29.255\nnever again must the world\nhave this kind of problem.\n\n00:14:29.279 --> 00:14:32.995\nAnd they had to build structures\nfor peace and security.\n\n00:14:33.019 --> 00:14:36.480\nAnd what did we get?\nWhat did they achieve?\n\n00:14:36.504 --> 00:14:39.123\nThe Charter of the United Nations,\n\n00:14:39.147 --> 00:14:42.698\nthe Bretton Woods institutions,\nas they're called, The World Bank,\n\n00:14:42.722 --> 00:14:45.159\nand the International Monetary Fund.\n\n00:14:45.183 --> 00:14:48.557\nA Marshall Plan for Europe,\na devastated Europe,\n\n00:14:48.581 --> 00:14:50.503\nto reconstruct it.\n\n00:14:50.527 --> 00:14:52.588\nAnd indeed a few years later,\n\n00:14:52.612 --> 00:14:55.765\nthe Universal Declaration of Human Rights.\n\n00:14:56.322 --> 00:15:01.936\n2015 is a year that is similar\nin its importance\n\n00:15:01.960 --> 00:15:06.811\nto 1945, with similar challenges\nand similar potential.\n\n00:15:07.335 --> 00:15:10.358\nThere will be two big summits this year:\n\n00:15:10.382 --> 00:15:13.161\nthe first one, in September in New York,\n\n00:15:13.185 --> 00:15:16.470\nis the summit for the sustainable\ndevelopment goals.\n\n00:15:17.029 --> 00:15:22.507\nAnd then the summit in Paris in December,\nto give us a climate agreement.\n\n00:15:23.323 --> 00:15:29.650\nThe sustainable development goals\nare intended to help countries\n\n00:15:29.674 --> 00:15:33.784\nto live sustainably,\nin tune with Mother Earth,\n\n00:15:33.808 --> 00:15:39.134\nnot to take out of Mother Earth\nand destroy ecosystems,\n\n00:15:39.158 --> 00:15:42.772\nbut rather, to live in harmony\nwith Mother Earth,\n\n00:15:42.796 --> 00:15:46.625\nby living under sustainable development.\n\n00:15:46.649 --> 00:15:49.022\nAnd the sustainable development goals\n\n00:15:49.046 --> 00:15:51.431\nwill come into operation for all countries\n\n00:15:51.455 --> 00:15:54.327\non January 1, 2016.\n\n00:15:54.772 --> 00:15:55.949\nThe climate agreement --\n\n00:15:55.973 --> 00:15:57.489\na binding climate agreement --\n\n00:15:57.513 --> 00:16:01.177\nis needed because\nof the scientific evidence\n\n00:16:01.201 --> 00:16:04.118\nthat we're on a trajectory\nfor about a four-degree world\n\n00:16:04.142 --> 00:16:07.630\nand we have to change course\nto stay below two degrees.\n\n00:16:07.991 --> 00:16:13.515\nSo we need to take steps\nthat will be monitored and reviewed,\n\n00:16:13.539 --> 00:16:17.937\nso that we can keep increasing\nthe ambition of how we cut emissions,\n\n00:16:17.961 --> 00:16:21.077\nand how we move more rapidly\nto renewable energy,\n\n00:16:21.101 --> 00:16:24.104\nso that we have a safe world.\n\n00:16:27.623 --> 00:16:33.806\nThe reality is that this issue\nis much too important\n\n00:16:33.830 --> 00:16:37.393\nto be left to politicians\nand to the United Nations.\n\n00:16:37.417 --> 00:16:38.418\n(Laughter)\n\n00:16:38.442 --> 00:16:40.020\nIt's an issue for all of us,\n\n00:16:40.044 --> 00:16:44.008\nand it's an issue where we need\nmore and more momentum.\n\n00:16:44.869 --> 00:16:48.354\nIndeed, the face of\nthe environmentalist has changed,\n\n00:16:48.378 --> 00:16:50.687\nbecause of the justice dimension.\n\n00:16:50.711 --> 00:16:53.931\nIt's now an issue\nfor faith-based organizations,\n\n00:16:53.955 --> 00:16:57.127\nunder very good leadership\nfrom Pope Francis,\n\n00:16:57.151 --> 00:16:58.923\nand indeed, the Church of England,\n\n00:16:58.947 --> 00:17:01.390\nwhich is divesting from fossil fuels.\n\n00:17:01.414 --> 00:17:05.172\nIt's an issue for the business community,\n\n00:17:05.196 --> 00:17:06.600\nand the good news is\n\n00:17:06.624 --> 00:17:09.534\nthat the business community\nis changing very rapidly --\n\n00:17:09.558 --> 00:17:11.743\nexcept for the fossil fuel industries --\n\n00:17:11.767 --> 00:17:13.362\n(Laughter)\n\n00:17:13.386 --> 00:17:16.682\nEven they are beginning\nto slightly change their language --\n\n00:17:16.706 --> 00:17:17.687\nbut only slightly.\n\n00:17:17.711 --> 00:17:22.402\nBut business is not only moving rapidly\nto the benefits of renewable energy,\n\n00:17:22.426 --> 00:17:25.149\nbut is urging politicians\nto give them more signals,\n\n00:17:25.173 --> 00:17:27.148\nso that they can move even more rapidly.\n\n00:17:27.172 --> 00:17:29.173\nIt's an issue for the trade\nunion movement.\n\n00:17:29.197 --> 00:17:31.220\nIt's an issue for the women's movement.\n\n00:17:31.244 --> 00:17:33.322\nIt's an issue for young people.\n\n00:17:33.346 --> 00:17:39.148\nI was very struck when I learned\nthat Jibreel Khazan,\n\n00:17:39.172 --> 00:17:44.816\none of the Greensboro Four who had\ntaken part in the Woolworth sit-ins,\n\n00:17:44.840 --> 00:17:46.354\nsaid quite recently that\n\n00:17:46.378 --> 00:17:52.380\nclimate change is the lunch counter\nmoment for young people.\n\n00:17:52.404 --> 00:17:56.692\nSo, lunch counter moment\nfor young people of the 21st century --\n\n00:17:56.716 --> 00:18:01.057\nthe sort of real human rights issue\nof the 21st century,\n\n00:18:01.081 --> 00:18:03.851\nbecause he said it is\nthe greatest challenge\n\n00:18:03.875 --> 00:18:07.467\nto humanity and justice in our world.\n\n00:18:08.349 --> 00:18:12.455\nI recall very much\nthe Climate March last September,\n\n00:18:12.479 --> 00:18:14.280\nand that was a huge momentum,\n\n00:18:14.304 --> 00:18:17.266\nnot just in New York,\nbut all around the world.\n\n00:18:17.290 --> 00:18:19.560\nand we have to build on that.\n\n00:18:19.584 --> 00:18:22.695\nI was marching with some\nof The Elders family,\n\n00:18:22.719 --> 00:18:27.746\nand I saw a placard\na little bit away from me,\n\n00:18:27.770 --> 00:18:29.724\nbut we were wedged so closely together --\n\n00:18:29.748 --> 00:18:33.423\nbecause after all, there were 400,000\npeople out in the streets of New York --\n\n00:18:33.447 --> 00:18:35.360\nso I couldn't quite get to that placard,\n\n00:18:35.384 --> 00:18:38.465\nI would have just liked to have been\nable to step behind it,\n\n00:18:38.489 --> 00:18:40.935\nbecause it said, \"Angry Grannies!\"\n\n00:18:40.959 --> 00:18:42.282\n(Laughter)\n\n00:18:42.306 --> 00:18:43.760\nThat's what I felt.\n\n00:18:43.784 --> 00:18:47.757\nAnd I have five grandchildren now,\n\n00:18:47.781 --> 00:18:52.069\nI feel very happy as an Irish grandmother\nto have five grandchildren,\n\n00:18:52.093 --> 00:18:55.136\nand I think about their world,\n\n00:18:55.160 --> 00:18:58.321\nand what it will be\nlike when they will share that world\n\n00:18:58.345 --> 00:19:02.391\nwith about 9 billion other people in 2050.\n\n00:19:03.532 --> 00:19:08.187\nWe know that inevitably it will\nbe a climate-constrained world,\n\n00:19:08.211 --> 00:19:11.060\nbecause of the emissions\nwe've already put up there,\n\n00:19:11.084 --> 00:19:16.481\nbut it could be a world that is much\nmore equal and much fairer,\n\n00:19:16.505 --> 00:19:19.087\nand much better for health,\nand better for jobs\n\n00:19:19.111 --> 00:19:21.083\nand better for energy security,\n\n00:19:21.107 --> 00:19:22.934\nthan the world we have now,\n\n00:19:22.958 --> 00:19:29.958\nif we have switched sufficiently\nand early enough to renewable energy,\n\n00:19:30.180 --> 00:19:32.612\nand no one is left behind.\n\n00:19:32.636 --> 00:19:35.031\nNo one is left behind.\n\n00:19:35.694 --> 00:19:39.274\nAnd just as we've been\nlooking back this year --\n\n00:19:39.298 --> 00:19:44.805\nin 2015 to 1945, looking back 70 years --\n\n00:19:44.829 --> 00:19:47.393\nI would like to think\nthat they will look back,\n\n00:19:47.417 --> 00:19:52.266\nthat world will look back\n35 years from 2050,\n\n00:19:52.290 --> 00:19:55.164\n35 years to 2015,\n\n00:19:55.188 --> 00:19:58.006\nand that they will say,\n\n00:19:58.030 --> 00:20:02.137\n\"Weren't they good\nto do what they did in 2015?\n\n00:20:02.161 --> 00:20:07.636\nWe really appreciate that they took\nthe decisions that made a difference,\n\n00:20:07.660 --> 00:20:10.598\nand that put the world\non the right pathway,\n\n00:20:10.622 --> 00:20:13.328\nand we benefit now from that pathway,\"\n\n00:20:13.352 --> 00:20:17.233\nthat they will feel that somehow\nwe took our responsibilities,\n\n00:20:17.257 --> 00:20:21.416\nwe did what was done\nin 1945 in similar terms,\n\n00:20:21.440 --> 00:20:23.861\nwe didn't miss the opportunity,\n\n00:20:23.885 --> 00:20:26.067\nwe lived up to our responsibilities.\n\n00:20:26.091 --> 00:20:29.263\nThat's what this year is about.\n\n00:20:29.646 --> 00:20:30.996\nAnd somehow for me,\n\n00:20:31.020 --> 00:20:35.314\nit's captured in words of somebody\nthat I admired very much.\n\n00:20:35.338 --> 00:20:37.671\nShe was a mentor of mine,\nshe was a friend,\n\n00:20:37.695 --> 00:20:39.643\nshe died much too young,\n\n00:20:39.667 --> 00:20:41.672\nshe was an extraordinary personality,\n\n00:20:41.696 --> 00:20:44.180\na great champion of the environment:\n\n00:20:44.204 --> 00:20:46.028\nWangari Maathai.\n\n00:20:46.585 --> 00:20:49.211\nWangari said once,\n\n00:20:49.235 --> 00:20:51.189\n\"In the course of history,\n\n00:20:51.213 --> 00:20:55.224\nthere comes a time\nwhen humanity is called upon\n\n00:20:55.248 --> 00:20:59.999\nto shift to a new level of consciousness,\n\n00:21:00.023 --> 00:21:03.480\nto reach a higher moral ground.\"\n\n00:21:04.093 --> 00:21:06.012\nAnd that's what we have to do.\n\n00:21:06.036 --> 00:21:09.324\nWe have to reach\na new level of consciousness,\n\n00:21:09.348 --> 00:21:11.315\na higher moral ground.\n\n00:21:11.749 --> 00:21:15.590\nAnd we have to do it this year\nin those two big summits.\n\n00:21:16.066 --> 00:21:19.664\nAnd that won't happen unless\nwe have the momentum\n\n00:21:19.688 --> 00:21:22.835\nfrom people around the world who say:\n\n00:21:22.859 --> 00:21:24.379\n\"We want action now,\n\n00:21:24.403 --> 00:21:25.974\nwe want to change course,\n\n00:21:25.998 --> 00:21:27.371\nwe want a safe

older", "duration": "717", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/robin_morgan_4_powerful_poems_about_parkinson_s_and_growing_older", "transcript": "When I was only three or four, I fell in love with poetry, with the rhythms and the music of language; with the power of metaphor and of imagery, poetry being the essence of communication \u2014 the discipline, the distillation. And all these years later, the poems I'll read today are from my just-finished seventh book of poetry.Well, five years ago, I was diagnosed with Parkinson's disease. Though there's no cure yet, advances in treatment are really impressive. But you can imagine that I was appalled to learn that women are largely left out of research trials, despite gender-specific medical findings having demonstrated that we are not actually just small men \u2014(Laughter)who happen to have different reproductive systems. Gender-specific medicine is good for men, too.But you bring to a crisis the person you already are, including the, yes, momentum that you've learned to invoke through passionate caring and through action, both of which require but also create energy. So as an activist, I began working with the Parkinson's Disease Foundation \u2014 that's pdf.org \u2014 to create a major initiative to put women on the Parkinson's disease map. And as a poet, I began working with this subject matter, finding it tragic, hilarious, sometimes even joyful. I do not feel diminished by Parkinson's; I feel distilled by it, and I actually very much like the woman I'm distilling into.\"No Signs of Struggle\"Growing small requires enormity of will: just sitting still in the doctor's waiting room watching the future shuffle in and out, watching it stoop; stare at you while you try not to look. Rare is an exchange: a smile of brief, wry recognition.You are the new kid on the block. Everyone here was you once. You are still learning that growing small requires a largeness of spirit you can't fit into yet: acceptance of irritating help from those who love you; giving way and over, but not up.You've swallowed hard the contents of the \"Drink Me\" bottle, and felt yourself shrink. Now, familiar furniture looms, floors tilt, and doorknobs yield only when wrestled round with both hands. It demands colossal patience, all this growing small: your diminished sleep at night, your handwriting, your voice, your height.You are more the incredible shrinking woman than the Buddhist mystic, serene, making do with less. Less is not always more. Yet in this emptying space, space glimmers, becoming visible. Here is a place behind the eyes of those accustomed by what some would call diminishment.It is a place of merciless poetry, a gift of presence previously ignored, drowned in the daily clutter. Here every gesture needs intention, is alive with consciousness. Nothing is automatic.You can spot it in the provocation of a button, an arm poking at a sleeve, a balancing act at a night-time curb while negotiating the dark. Feats of such modest valor, who would suspect them to be exercises in an intimate, fierce discipline, a metaphysics of being relentlessly aware?Such understated power here, in these tottering dancers who exert stupendous effort on tasks most view as insignificant. Such quiet beauty here, in these, my soft-voiced, stiff-limbed people; such resolve masked by each placid face. There is immensity required in growing small, so bent on such unbending grace.(Applause)Thank you.This one is called \"On Donating My Brain to Science.\"(Laughter)Not a problem. Skip over all the pages reassuring religious people. Already a universal donor: kidneys, corneas, liver, lungs, tissue, heart, veins, whatever.Odd that the modest brain never imagined its unique value in research, maybe saving someone else from what it is they're not quite sure I have. Flattering, that.So fill in the forms, drill through the answers, trill out a blithe spirit.And slice me, dice me, spread me on your slides. Find what I'm trying to tell you.Earn me, learn me, scan me, squint through your lens. Uncover what I'd hint at if I could.Be my guest, do your best, harvest me, track the clues. This was a good brain while alive. This was a brain that paid its dues.So slice me, dice me, smear me on your slides, stain me, explain me, drain me like a cup. Share me, hear me:I want to be used I want to be used I want to be used up.(Applause)(Applause ends)And this one's called \"The Ghost Light.\"Lit from within is the sole secure way to traverse dark matter. Some life forms \u2014 certain mushrooms, snails, jellyfish, worms \u2014 glow bioluminescent, and people as well; we emit infra-red light from our most lucent selves. Our tragedy is we can't see it.We see by reflecting. We need biofluorescence to show our true colors. External illumination can distort, though. When gravity bends light, huge galaxy clusters can act as telescopes, elongating background images of star systems to faint arcs \u2014 a lensing effect like viewing distant street lamps through a glass of wine.A glass of wine or two now makes me weave as if acting the drunkard's part; as if, besotted with unrequited love for the dynamic Turner canvasses spied out by the Hubble, I could lurch down a city street set without provoking every pedestrian walk-on stare.Stare as long as you need to. If you think about it, walking, even standing, is illogical \u2014 such tiny things, feet! \u2014(Laughter)especially when one's body is not al dente anymore.(Laughter)Besides, creature of extremes and excess, I've always thought Apollo beautiful but boring, and a bit of a dumb blonde. Dionysians don't do balance.Balance, in other words, has never been my strong point. But I digress. More and more these days, digression seems the most direct route through from where I've lost or found myself out of place, mind, turn, time.Place your foot just so, mind how you turn: too swift a swivel can bring you down. Take your time ushering the audience out, saying goodbye to the actors. The ghost light is what they call the single bulb hanging above the bare stage in an empty theater.In the empty theater of such a night, waking to meet no external radiance, this is the final struggle left to win, this the sole beacon to beckon the darkness in and let the rest begin, this the lens through which at last to see both Self and Other arrayed with the bright stain of original sin: lit from within.(Applause)And this is the last one.\"This Dark Hour\"Late summer, 4 A.M. The rain slows to a stop, dripping still from the broad leaves of blue hostas unseen in the garden's dark. Barefoot, careful on the slick slate slabs, I need no light, I know the way, stoop by the mint bed, scoop a fistful of moist earth, then grope for a chair, spread a shawl, and sit, breathing in the wet green August air.This is the small, still hour before the newspaper lands in the vestibule like a grenade, the phone shrills, the computer screen blinks and glares awake.There is this hour: poem in my head, soil in my hand: unnamable fullness. This hour, when blood of my blood bone of bone, child grown to manhood now \u2014 stranger, intimate, not distant but apart \u2014 lies safe, off dreaming melodies while love sleeps, safe, in his arms.To have come to this place, lived to this moment: immeasurable lightness. The density of black starts to blur umber. Tentative, a cardinal's coloratura, then the mourning dove's elegy. Sable glimmers toward grey; objects emerge, trailing shadows; night ages toward day. The city stirs.There will be other dawns, nights, gaudy noons. Likely, I'll lose my way. There will be stumbling, falling, cursing the dark. Whatever comes, there was this hour when nothing mattered, all was unbearably dear.And when I'm done with daylights, should those who loved me grieve too long a while, let them remember that I had this hour \u2014 this dark, perfect hour \u2014 and smile.Thank you.(Applause)", "id": 2336, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:12.775 -->

"https://www.ted.com/talks/samuel_cohen_alzheimer_s_is_not_normal_aging_and_we_can_cure_it", "transcript": "In the year 1901, a woman called Auguste was taken to a medical asylum in Frankfurt. Auguste was delusional and couldn't remember even the most basic details of her life. Her doctor was called Alois. Alois didn't know how to help Auguste, but he watched over her until, sadly, she passed away in 1906. After she died, Alois performed an autopsy and found strange plaques and tangles in Auguste's brain \u2014 the likes of which he'd never seen before.Now here's the even more striking thing. If Auguste had instead been alive today, we could offer her no more help than Alois was able to 114 years ago. Alois was Dr. Alois Alzheimer. And Auguste Deter was the first patient to be diagnosed with what we now call Alzheimer's disease. Since 1901, medicine has advanced greatly. We've discovered antibiotics and vaccines to protect us from infections, many treatments for cancer, antiretrovirals for HIV, statins for heart disease and much more. But we've made essentially no progress at all in treating Alzheimer's disease.I'm part of a team of scientists who has been working to find a cure for Alzheimer's for over a decade. So I think about this all the time. Alzheimer's now affects 40 million people worldwide. But by 2050, it will affect 150 million people \u2014 which, by the way, will include many of you. If you're hoping to live to be 85 or older, your chance of getting Alzheimer's will be almost one in two. In other words, odds are you'll spend your golden years either suffering from Alzheimer's or helping to look after a friend or loved one with Alzheimer's. Already in the United States alone, Alzheimer's care costs 200 billion dollars every year. One out of every five Medicare dollars get spent on Alzheimer's. It is today the most expensive disease, and costs are projected to increase fivefold by 2050, as the baby boomer generation ages.It may surprise you that, put simply, Alzheimer's is one of the biggest medical and social challenges of our generation. But we've done relatively little to address it. Today, of the top 10 causes of death worldwide, Alzheimer's is the only one we cannot prevent, cure or even slow down. We understand less about the science of Alzheimer's than other diseases because we've invested less time and money into researching it. The US government spends 10 times more every year on cancer research than on Alzheimer's despite the fact that Alzheimer's costs us more and causes a similar number of deaths each year as cancer.The lack of resources stems from a more fundamental cause: a lack of awareness. Because here's what few people know but everyone should: Alzheimer's is a disease, and we can cure it. For most of the past 114 years, everyone, including scientists, mistakenly confused Alzheimer's with aging. We thought that becoming senile was a normal and inevitable part of getting old. But we only have to look at a picture of a healthy aged brain compared to the brain of an Alzheimer's patient to see the real physical damage caused by this disease. As well as triggering severe loss of memory and mental abilities, the damage to the brain caused by Alzheimer's significantly reduces life expectancy and is always fatal.Remember Dr. Alzheimer found strange plaques and tangles in Auguste's brain a century ago. For almost a century, we didn't know much about these. Today we know they're made from protein molecules. You can imagine a protein molecule as a piece of paper that normally folds into an elaborate piece of origami. There are spots on the paper that are sticky. And when it folds correctly, these sticky bits end up on the inside. But sometimes things go wrong, and some sticky bits are on the outside. This causes the protein molecules to stick to each other, forming clumps that eventually become large plaques and tangles. That's what we see in the brains of Alzheimer's patients.We've spent the past 10 years at the University of Cambridge trying to understand how this malfunction works. There are many steps, and identifying which step to try to block is complex \u2014 like defusing a bomb. Cutting one wire might do nothing. Cutting others might make the bomb explore. We have to find the right step to block, and then create a drug that does it.Until recently, we for the most part have been cutting wires and hoping for the best. But now we've got together a diverse group of people \u2014 medics, biologists, geneticists, chemists, physicists, engineers and mathematicians. And together, we've managed to identify a critical step in the process and are now testing a new class of drugs which would specifically block this step and stop the disease.Now let me show you some of our latest results. No one outside of our lab has seen these yet. Let's look at some videos of what happened when we tested these new drugs in worms. So these are healthy worms, and you can see they're moving around normally. These worms, on the other hand, have protein molecules sticking together inside them \u2014 like humans with Alzheimer's. And you can see they're clearly sick. But if we give our new drugs to these worms at an early stage, then we see that they're healthy, and they live a normal lifespan. This is just an initial positive result, but research like this shows us that Alzheimer's is a disease that we can understand and we can cure.After 114 years of waiting, there's finally real hope for what can be achieved in the next 10 or 20 years. But to grow that hope, to finally beat Alzheimer's, we need help. This isn't about scientists like me \u2014 it's about you. We need you to raise awareness that Alzheimer's is a disease and that if we try, we can beat it. In the case of other diseases, patients and their families have led the charge for more research and put pressure on governments, the pharmaceutical industry, scientists and regulators. That was essential for advancing treatment for HIV in the late 1980s. Today, we see that same drive to beat cancer. But Alzheimer's patients are often unable to speak up for themselves. And their families, the hidden victims, caring for their loved ones night and day, are often too worn out to go out and advocate for change. So, it really is down to you. Alzheimer's isn't, for the most part, a genetic disease. Everyone with a brain is at risk. Today, there are 40 million patients like Auguste, who can't create the change they need for themselves. Help speak up for them, and help demand a cure.Thank you.(Applause)", "id": 2340, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:12.758 --> 00:00:14.574\nIn the year

disease\n\n00:06:48.158 --> 00:06:50.774\nand that if we try, we can beat it.\n\n00:06:50.798 --> 00:06:52.614\nIn the case of other diseases,\n\n00:06:52.638 --> 00:06:55.774\npatients and their families\nhave led the charge for more research\n\n00:06:55.798 --> 00:06:58.734\nand put pressure on governments,\nthe pharmaceutical industry,\n\n00:06:58.758 --> 00:07:00.974\nscientists and regulators.\n\n00:07:00.998 --> 00:07:05.854\nThat was essential for advancing treatment\nfor HIV in the late 1980s.\n\n00:07:05.878 --> 00:07:09.558\nToday, we see that same drive\nto beat cancer.\n\n00:07:10.278 --> 00:07:14.614\nBut Alzheimer's patients are often\nunable to speak up for themselves.\n\n00:07:14.638 --> 00:07:19.374\nAnd their families, the hidden victims,\ncaring for their loved ones night and day,\n\n00:07:19.398 --> 00:07:22.438\nare often too worn out\nto go out and advocate for change.\n\n00:07:23.278 --> 00:07:26.358\nSo, it really is down to you.\n\n00:07:27.678 --> 00:07:31.014\nAlzheimer's isn't,\nfor the most part, a genetic disease.\n\n00:07:31.038 --> 00:07:33.158\nEveryone with a brain is at risk.\n\n00:07:34.118 --> 00:07:38.614\nToday, there are 40 million\npatients like Auguste,\n\n00:07:38.638 --> 00:07:41.534\nwho can't create the change\nthey need for themselves.\n\n00:07:41.558 --> 00:07:43.118\nHelp speak up for them,\n\n00:07:44.038 --> 00:07:46.238\nand help demand a cure.\n\n00:07:47.304 --> 00:07:48.454\nThank you.\n\n00:07:48.478 --> 00:07:52.078\n(Applause)"}, {"title": "Don't ask where I'm from,

In 13 months, I flew to 14 countries and gave some hundred talks. Every talk in every country began with an introduction, and every introduction began, alas, with a lie: \"Taiye Selasi comes from Ghana and Nigeria,\" or \"Taiye Selasi comes from England and the States.\" Whenever I heard this opening sentence, no matter the country that concluded it \u2014 England, America, Ghana, Nigeria \u2014 I thought, \"But that's not true.\" Yes, I was born in England and grew up in the United States. My mum, born in England, and raised in Nigeria, currently lives in Ghana. My father was born in Gold Coast, a British colony, raised in Ghana, and has lived for over 30 years in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. For this reason, my introducers also called me \"multinational.\" \"But Nike is multinational,\" I thought, \"I'm a human being.\"Then, one fine day, mid-tour, I went to Louisiana, a museum in Denmark where I shared the stage with the writer Colum McCann. We were discussing the role of locality in writing, when suddenly it hit me. I'm not multinational. I'm not a national at all. How could I come from a nation? How can a human being come from a concept? It's a question that had been bothering me for going on two decades. From newspapers, textbooks, conversations, I had learned to speak of countries as if they were eternal, singular, naturally occurring things, but I wondered: to say that I came from a country suggested that the country was an absolute, some fixed point in place in time, a constant thing, but was it? In my lifetime, countries had disappeared \u2014 Czechoslovakia; appeared \u2014 Timor-Leste; failed \u2014 Somalia. My parents came from countries that didn't exist when they were born. To me, a country \u2014 this thing that could be born, die, expand, contract \u2014 hardly seemed the basis for understanding a human being.And so it came as a huge relief to discover the sovereign state. What we call countries are actually various expressions of sovereign statehood, an idea that came into fashion only 400 years ago. When I learned this, beginning my masters degree in international relations, I felt a sort of surge of relief. It was as I had suspected. History was real, cultures were real, but countries were invented. For the next 10 years, I sought to re- or un-define myself, my world, my work, my experience, beyond the logic of the state.In 2005, I wrote an essay, \"What is an Afropolitan,\" sketching out an identity that privileged culture over country. It was thrilling how many people could relate to my experience, and instructional how many others didn't buy my sense of self. \"How can Selasi claim to come from Ghana,\" one such critic asked, \"when she's never known the indignities of traveling abroad on a Ghanian passport?\"Now, if I'm honest, I knew just what she meant. I've got a friend named Layla who was born and raised in Ghana. Her parents are third-generation Ghanians of Lebanese descent. Layla, who speaks fluent Twi, knows Accra like the back of her hand, but when we first met years ago, I thought, \"She's not from Ghana.\" In my mind, she came from Lebanon, despite the patent fact that all her formative experience took place in suburban Accra. I, like my critics, was imagining some Ghana where all Ghanaians had brown skin or none held U.K. passports. I'd fallen into the limiting trap that the language of coming from countries sets \u2014 the privileging of a fiction, the singular country, over reality: human experience. Speaking with Colum McCann that day, the penny finally dropped. \"All experience is local,\" he said. \"All identity is experience,\" I thought. \"I'm not a national,\" I proclaimed onstage. \"I'm a local. I'm multi-local.\"See, \"Taiye Selasi comes from the United States,\" isn't the truth. I have no relationship with the United States, all 50 of them, not really. My relationship is with Brookline, the town where I grew up; with New York City, where I started work; with Lawrenceville, where I spend Thanksgiving. What makes America home for me is not my passport or accent, but these very particular experiences and the places they occur. Despite my pride in Ewe culture, the Black Stars, and my love of Ghanaian food, I've never had a relationship with the Republic of Ghana, writ large. My relationship is with Accra, where my mother lives, where I go each year, with the little garden in Dzorwulu where my father and I talk for hours. These are the places that shape my experience. My experience is where I'm from.What if we asked, instead of \"Where are you from?\" \u2014 \"Where are you a local?\" This would tell us so much more about who and how similar we are. Tell me you're from France, and I see what, a set of clich\u00e9s? Adichie's dangerous single story, the myth of the nation of France? Tell me you're a local of Fez and Paris, better yet, Goutte d'Or, and I see a set of experiences. Our experience is where we're from.So, where are you a local? I propose a three-step test. I call these the three \"R\u2019s\": rituals, relationships, restrictions.First, think of your daily rituals, whatever they may be: making your coffee, driving to work, harvesting your crops, saying your prayers. What kind of rituals are these? Where do they occur? In what city or cities in the world do shopkeepers know your face? As a child, I carried out fairly standard suburban rituals in Boston, with adjustments made for the rituals my mother brought from London and Lagos. We took off our shoes in the house, we were unfailingly polite with our elders, we ate slow-cooked, spicy food. In snowy North America, ours were rituals of the global South. The first time I went to Delhi or to southern parts of Italy, I was shocked by how at home I felt. The rituals were familiar. \"R\" number one, rituals.Now, think of your relationships, of the people who shape your days. To whom do you speak at least once a week, be it face to face or on FaceTime? Be reasonable in your assessment; I'm not talking about your Facebook friends. I'm speaking of the people who shape your weekly emotional experience. My mother in Accra, my twin sister in Boston, my best friends in New York: these relationships are home for me. \"R\" number two, relationships.We're local where we carry out our rituals and relationships, but how we experience our locality depends in part on our restrictions. By restrictions, I mean, where are you able to live? What passport do you hold? Are you restricted by, say, racism, from feeling fully at home where you live? By civil war, dysfunctional governance, economic inflation, from living in the locality where you had your rituals as a child? This is the least sexy of the R\u2019s, less lyric than rituals and relationships, but the question takes us past \"Where are you now?\" to \"Why aren't you there, and why?\" Rituals, relationships, restrictions.Take a piece of paper and put those three words on top of three columns, then try to fill those columns as honestly as you can. A very different picture of your life in local context, of your identity as a set of experiences, may emerge.So let's try it. I have a friend named Olu. He's 35 years old. His parents, born in Nigeria, came to Germany on scholarships. Olu was born in Nuremberg and lived there until age 10. When his family moved to Lagos, he studied in London, then came to Berlin. He loves going to Nigeria \u2014 the weather, the food, the friends \u2014 but hates the political corruption there. Where is Olu from?I have another friend named Udo. He's also 35 years old. Udo was born in C\u00f3rdoba, in northwest Argentina, where his grandparents migrated from Germany, what is now Poland, after the war. Udo studied in Buenos Aires, and nine years ago came to Berlin. He loves going to Argentina \u2014  the weather, the food, the friends \u2014 but hates the economic corruption there. Where is Udo from? With his blonde hair and blue eyes, Udo could pass for German, but holds an Argentinian passport, so needs a visa to live in Berlin. That Udo is from Argentina has largely to do with history. That he's a local of Buenos Aires and Berlin, that has to do with life.Olu, who looks Nigerian, needs a visa to visit Nigeria. He speaks Yoruba with an English accent, and English with a German one. To claim that he's \"not really Nigerian,\" though, denies his experience in Lagos, the rituals he practiced growing up, his relationship with family and friends.Meanwhile, though Lagos is undoubtedly one of his homes, Olu always feels restricted there, not least by the fact that he's gay.Both he and Udo are restricted by the political conditions of their parents' countries, from living where some of their most meaningful rituals and relationships occur. To say Olu is from Nigeria and Udo is from Argentina distracts from their common experience. Their rituals, their relationships, and their restrictions are the same.Of course, when we ask, \"Where are you from?\" we're using a kind of shorthand. It's quicker to say \"Nigeria\" than \"Lagos and Berlin,\" and as with Google Maps, we can always zoom in closer, from country to city to neighborhood. But that's not quite the point. The difference between \"Where are you from?\" and \"Where are you a local?\" isn't the specificity of the answer; it's the intention of the question. Replacing the language of nationality with the language of locality asks us to shift our focus to where real life occurs. Even that most glorious expression of countryhood, the World Cup, gives us national teams comprised mostly of multilocal players. As a unit of measurement for human experience, the country doesn't quite work. That's why Olu says, \"I'm German, but my parents come from Nigeria.\" The \"but\" in that sentence belies the inflexibility of the units, one fixed and fictional entity bumping up against another. \"I'm a local of Lagos and Berlin,\" suggests overlapping experiences, layers that merge together, that can't be denied or removed. You can take away my passport, but you can't take away my experience. That I carry within me. Where I'm from comes wherever I go.To be clear, I'm not suggesting that we do away with countries. There's much to be said for national history, more for the sovereign state. Culture exists in community, and community exists in context. Geography, tradition, collective memory: these things are important. What I'm questioning is primacy. All of those introductions on tour began with reference to nation, as if knowing what country I came from would tell my audience who I was. What are we really seeking, though, when we ask where someone comes from? And what are we really seeing when we hear an answer?Here's one possibility: basically, countries represent power. \"Where are you from?\" Mexico. Poland. Bangladesh. Less power. America. Germany. Japan. More power. China. Russia. Ambiguous.(Laughter)It's possible that without realizing it, we're playing a power game, especially in the context of multi-ethnic countries. As any recent immigrant knows, the question \"Where are you from?\" or \"Where are you really from?\" is often code for \"Why are you here?\"Then we have the scholar William Deresiewicz's writing of elite American colleges. \"Students think that their environment is diverse if one comes from Missouri and another from Pakistan \u2014 never mind that all of their parents are doctors or bankers.\"I'm with him. To call one student American, another Pakistani, then triumphantly claim student body diversity ignores the fact that these students are locals of the same milieu. The same holds true on the other end of the economic spectrum. A Mexican gardener in Los Angeles and a Nepali housekeeper in Delhi have more in common in terms of rituals and restrictions than nationality implies.Perhaps my biggest problem with coming from countries is the myth of going back to them. I'm often asked if I plan to \"go back\" to Ghana. I go to Accra every year, but I can't \"go back\" to Ghana. It's not because I wasn't born there. My father can't go back, either. The country in which he was born, that country no longer exists. We can never go back to a place and find it exactly where we left it. Something, somewhere will always have changed, most of all, ourselves. People.Finally, what we're talking about is human experience, this notoriously and gloriously disorderly affair. In creative writing, locality bespeaks humanity. The more we know about where a story is set, the more local color and texture, the more human the characters start to feel, the more relatable, not less. The myth of national identity and the vocabulary of coming from confuses us into placing ourselves into mutually exclusive categories. In fact, all of us are multi \u2014 multi-local, multi-layered. To begin our conversations with an acknowledgement of this complexity brings us closer together, I think, not further apart. So the next time that I'm introduced, I'd love to hear the truth: \"Taiye Selasi is a human being, like everybody here. She isn't a citizen of the world, but a citizen of worlds. She is a local of New York, Rome and Accra.\"Thank you.(Applause)", "id": 2333, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:12.957 --> 00:00:15.569\nLast year, I

00:05:24.137\nwith New York City, where I started work;\n\n00:05:24.161 --> 00:05:26.945\nwith Lawrenceville,\nwhere I spend Thanksgiving.\n\n00:05:27.755 --> 00:05:32.995\nWhat makes America home for me\nis not my passport or accent,\n\n00:05:33.019 --> 00:05:35.655\nbut these very particular experiences\n\n00:05:35.679 --> 00:05:37.637\nand the places they occur.\n\n00:05:38.034 --> 00:05:40.765\nDespite my pride in Ewe culture,\n\n00:05:40.789 --> 00:05:43.933\nthe Black Stars,\nand my love of Ghanaian food,\n\n00:05:43.957 --> 00:05:48.315\nI've never had a relationship\nwith the Republic of Ghana, writ large.\n\n00:05:48.696 --> 00:05:52.351\nMy relationship is with Accra,\nwhere my mother lives,\n\n00:05:52.375 --> 00:05:53.986\nwhere I go each year,\n\n00:05:54.010 --> 00:05:58.406\nwith the little garden in Dzorwulu\nwhere my father and I talk for hours.\n\n00:05:59.167 --> 00:06:02.129\nThese are the places\nthat shape my experience.\n\n00:06:02.565 --> 00:06:04.914\nMy experience is where I'm from.\n\n00:06:05.957 --> 00:06:09.336\nWhat if we asked, instead\nof \"Where are you from?\" --\n\n00:06:09.740 --> 00:06:11.544\n\"Where are you a local?\"\n\n00:06:11.568 --> 00:06:15.981\nThis would tell us so much more\nabout who and how similar we are.\n\n00:06:16.005 --> 00:06:20.589\nTell me you're from France,\nand I see what, a set of clich\u00e9s?\n\n00:06:20.613 --> 00:06:24.853\nAdichie's dangerous single story,\nthe myth of the nation of France?\n\n00:06:25.313 --> 00:06:28.547\nTell me you're a local of Fez and Paris,\n\n00:06:28.571 --> 00:06:32.936\nbetter yet, Goutte d'Or, and I see\na set of experiences.\n\n00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:35.933\nOur experience is where we're from.\n\n00:06:35.957 --> 00:06:38.004\nSo, where are you a local?\n\n00:06:38.028 --> 00:06:40.099\nI propose a three-step test.\n\n00:06:40.559 --> 00:06:46.220\nI call these the three \"R\u2019s\":\nrituals, relationships, restrictions.\n\n00:06:46.577 --> 00:06:50.491\nFirst, think of your daily rituals,\nwhatever they may be:\n\n00:06:50.515 --> 00:06:52.548\nmaking your coffee, driving to work,\n\n00:06:52.572 --> 00:06:55.448\nharvesting your crops,\nsaying your prayers.\n\n00:06:55.472 --> 00:06:57.694\nWhat kind of rituals are these?\n\n00:06:57.718 --> 00:06:59.171\nWhere do they occur?\n\n00:06:59.195 --> 00:07:03.834\nIn what city or cities in the world\ndo shopkeepers know your face?\n\n00:07:04.540 --> 00:07:08.933\nAs a child, I carried out fairly standard\nsuburban rituals in Boston,\n\n00:07:08.957 --> 00:07:13.588\nwith adjustments made for the rituals\nmy mother brought from London and Lagos.\n\n00:07:13.612 --> 00:07:15.459\nWe took off our shoes in the house,\n\n00:07:15.483 --> 00:07:18.173\nwe were unfailingly\npolite with our elders,\n\n00:07:18.197 --> 00:07:20.434\nwe ate slow-cooked, spicy food.\n\n00:07:20.823 --> 00:07:25.519\nIn snowy North America,\nours were rituals of the global South.\n\n00:07:26.090 --> 00:07:29.933\nThe first time I went to Delhi\nor to southern parts of Italy,\n\n00:07:29.957 --> 00:07:32.293\nI was shocked by how at home I felt.\n\n00:07:32.317 --> 00:07:34.448\nThe rituals were familiar.\n\n00:07:34.933 --> 00:07:37.036\n\"R\" number one, rituals.\n\n00:07:37.536 --> 00:07:41.650\nNow, think of your relationships,\nof the people who shape your days.\n\n00:07:42.023 --> 00:07:44.563\nTo whom do you speak at least once a week,\n\n00:07:44.587 --> 00:07:47.387\nbe it face to face or on FaceTime?\n\n00:07:47.411 --> 00:07:49.117\nBe reasonable in your assessment;\n\n00:07:49.141 --> 00:07:51.998\nI'm not talking about\nyour Facebook friends.\n\n00:07:52.022 --> 00:07:56.305\nI'm speaking of the people who shape\nyour weekly emotional experience.\n\n00:07:56.329 --> 00:07:58.933\nMy mother in Accra,\nmy twin sister in Boston,\n\n00:07:58.957 --> 00:08:00.999\nmy best friends in New York:\n\n00:08:01.023 --> 00:08:03.368\nthese relationships are home for me.\n\n00:08:03.780 --> 00:08:06.067\n\"R\" number two, relationships.\n\n00:08:06.623 --> 00:08:10.933\nWe're local where we carry out\nour rituals and relationships,\n\n00:08:10.957 --> 00:08:13.699\nbut how we experience our locality\n\n00:08:13.723 --> 00:08:17.009\ndepends in part on our restrictions.\n\n00:08:17.033 --> 00:08:19.876\nBy restrictions, I mean,\nwhere are you able to live?\n\n00:08:19.900 --> 00:08:21.933\nWhat passport do you hold?\n\n00:08:21.957 --> 00:08:27.224\nAre you restricted by, say, racism,\nfrom feeling fully at home where you live?\n\n00:08:27.248 --> 00:08:31.511\nBy civil war, dysfunctional governance,\neconomic inflation,\n\n00:08:31.535 --> 00:08:35.933\nfrom living in the locality\nwhere you had your rituals as a child?\n\n00:08:36.354 --> 00:08:38.951\nThis is the least sexy of the R\u2019s,\n\n00:08:38.975 --> 00:08:41.933\nless lyric than rituals and relationships,\n\n00:08:41.957 --> 00:08:45.267\nbut the question takes us past\n\"Where are you now?\"\n\n00:08:45.291 --> 00:08:48.315\nto \"Why aren't you there, and why?\"\n\n00:08:49.132 --> 00:08:51.969\nRituals, relationships, restrictions.\n\n00:08:52.461 --> 00:08:53.986\nTake a piece of paper\n\n00:08:54.010 --> 00:08:57.302\nand put those three words\non top of three columns,\n\n00:08:57.326 --> 00:09:00.642\nthen try to fill those columns\nas honestly as you can.\n\n00:09:00.999 --> 00:09:05.160\nA very different picture\nof your life in local context,\n\n00:09:05.184 --> 00:09:08.598\nof your identity as a set of experiences,\n\n00:09:08.622 --> 00:09:09.782\nmay emerge.\n\n00:09:09.806 --> 00:09:11.022\nSo let's try it.\n\n00:09:11.046 --> 00:09:12.811\nI have a friend named Olu.\n\n00:09:12.835 --> 00:09:14.430\nHe's 35 years old.\n\n00:09:14.454 --> 00:09:18.399\nHis parents, born in Nigeria,\ncame to Germany on scholarships.\n\n00:09:18.423 --> 00:09:21.984\nOlu was born in Nuremberg\nand lived there until age 10.\n\n00:09:22.008 --> 00:09:24.801\nWhen his family moved to Lagos,\nhe studied in London,\n\n00:09:24.825 --> 00:09:26.250\nthen came to Berlin.\n\n00:09:26.274 --> 00:09:28.933\nHe loves going to Nigeria --\n\n00:09:28.957 --> 00:09:31.591\nthe weather, the food, the friends --\n\n00:09:31.615 --> 00:09:34.129\nbut hates the political corruption there.\n\n00:09:34.613 --> 00:09:35.813\nWhere is Olu from?\n\n00:09:36.384 --> 00:09:38.575\nI have another friend named Udo.\n\n00:09:38.599 --> 00:09:40.106\nHe's also 35 years old.\n\n00:09:40.582 --> 00:09:43.781\nUdo was born in C\u00f3rdoba,\nin northwest Argentina,\n\n00:09:43.805 --> 00:09:46.993\nwhere his grandparents migrated\nfrom Germany, what is now Poland,\n\n00:09:47.017 --> 00:09:48.445\nafter the war.\n\n00:09:48.469 --> 00:09:52.351\nUdo studied in Buenos Aires,\nand nine years ago came to Berlin.\n\n00:09:52.375 --> 00:09:56.576\nHe loves going to Argentina -- \nthe weather, the food, the friends --\n\n00:09:56.600 --> 00:09:59.060\nbut hates the economic corruption there.\n\n00:09:59.425 --> 00:10:01.363\nWhere is Udo from?\n\n00:10:01.387 --> 00:10:05.020\nWith his blonde hair and blue eyes,\nUdo could pass for German,\n\n00:10:05.044 --> 00:10:09.100\nbut holds an Argentinian passport,\nso needs a visa to live in Berlin.\n\n00:10:09.124 --> 00:10:13.433\nThat Udo is from Argentina\nhas largely to do with history.\n\n00:10:13.457 --> 00:10:16.614\nThat he's a local\nof Buenos Aires and Berlin,\n\n00:10:16.638 --> 00:10:18.423\nthat has to do with life.\n\n00:10:18.732 --> 00:10:22.933\nOlu, who looks Nigerian,\nneeds a visa to visit Nigeria.\n\n00:10:22.957 --> 00:10:25.348\nHe speaks Yoruba with an English accent,\n\n00:10:25.372 --> 00:10:27.451\nand English with a German one.\n\n00:10:27.475 --> 00:10:30.016\nTo claim that he's\n\"not really Nigerian,\" though,\n\n00:10:30.040 --> 00:10:32.368\ndenies his experience in Lagos,\n\n00:10:32.392 --> 00:10:34.575\nthe rituals he practiced growing up,\n\n00:10:34.599 --> 00:10:37.028\nhis relationship with family and friends.\n\n00:10:37.489 --> 00:10:41.410\nMeanwhile, though Lagos\nis undoubtedly one of his homes,\n\n00:10:41.434 --> 00:10:43.933\nOlu always feels restricted there,\n\n00:10:43.957 --> 00:10:46.226\nnot least by the fact that he's gay.\n\n00:10:47.186 --> 00:10:50.908\nBoth he and Udo are restricted\nby the political conditions\n\n00:10:50.933 --> 00:10:52.586\nof their parents' countries,\n\n00:10:52.610 --> 00:10:55.594\nfrom living where some of their\nmost meaningful rituals\n\n00:10:55.618 --> 00:10:57.568\nand relationships occur.\n\n00:10:57.592 --> 00:11:01.693\nTo say Olu is from Nigeria\nand Udo is from Argentina\n\n00:11:01.717 --> 00:11:03.830\ndistracts from their common experience.\n\n00:11:03.854 --> 00:11:07.469\nTheir rituals, their relationships,\nand their restrictions are the same.\n\n00:11:08.104 --> 00:11:10.518\nOf course, when we ask,\n\"Where are you from?\"\n\n00:11:10.542 --> 00:11:12.463\nwe're using a kind of shorthand.\n\n00:11:12.487 --> 00:11:16.414\nIt's quicker to say \"Nigeria\"\nthan \"Lagos and Berlin,\"\n\n00:11:16.874 --> 00:11:20.705\nand as with Google Maps,\nwe can always zoom in closer,\n\n00:11:20.729 --> 00:11:23.189\nfrom country to city to neighborhood.\n\n00:11:23.213 --> 00:11:25.506\nBut that's not quite the point.\n\n00:11:26.268 --> 00:11:28.857\nThe difference between\n\"Where are you from?\"\n\n00:11:28.881 --> 00:11:30.397\nand \"Where are you a local?\"\n\n00:11:30.421 --> 00:11:33.383\nisn't the specificity of the answer;\n\n00:11:33.407 --> 00:11:35.522\nit's the intention of the question.\n\n00:11:35.998 --> 00:11:41.139\nReplacing the language of nationality\nwith the language of locality asks us\n\n00:11:41.164 --> 00:11:44.855\nto shift our focus\nto where real life occurs.\n\n00:11:45.307 --> 00:11:49.524\nEven that most glorious expression\nof countryhood, the World Cup,\n\n00:11:49.548 --> 00:11:55.244\ngives us national teams comprised\nmostly of multilocal players.\n\n00:11:55.617 --> 00:11:58.134\nAs a unit of measurement\nfor human experience,\n\n00:11:58.158 --> 00:12:00.933\nthe country doesn't quite work.\n\n00:12:00.957 --> 00:12:04.810\nThat's why Olu says, \"I'm German,\nbut my parents come from Nigeria.\"\n\n00:12:05.207 --> 00:12:10.563\nThe \"but\" in that sentence\nbelies the inflexibility of the units,\n\n00:12:10.587 --> 00:12:14.725\none fixed and fictional entity\nbumping up against another.\n\n00:12:15.122 --> 00:12:19.544\n\"I'm a local of Lagos and Berlin,\"\nsuggests overlapping experiences,\n\n00:12:19.568 --> 00:12:23.793\nlayers that merge together,\nthat can't be denied or removed.\n\n00:12:24.134 --> 00:12:26.366\nYou can take away my passport,\n\n00:12:26.390 --> 00:12:28.497\nbut you can't take away my experience.\n\n00:12:28.521 --> 00:12:30.632\nThat I carry within me.\n\n00:12:30.656 --> 00:12:33.298\nWhere I'm from comes wherever I go.\n\n00:12:34.211 --> 00:12:37.578\nTo be clear, I'm not suggesting\nthat we do away with countries.\n\n00:12:37.603 --> 00:12:39.736\nThere's much to be said\nfor national history,\n\n00:12:39.761 --> 00:12:41.722\nmore for the sovereign state.\n\n00:12:41.746 --> 00:12:46.443\nCulture exists in community,\nand community exists in context.\n\n00:12:46.467 --> 00:12:50.433\nGeography, tradition, collective memory:\nthese things are important.\n\n00:12:50.964 --> 00:12:53.472\nWhat I'm questioning is primacy.\n\n00:12:53.957 --> 00:12:58.621\nAll of those introductions on tour\nbegan with reference to nation,\n\n00:12:58.645 --> 00:13:02.968\nas if knowing what country I came\nfrom would tell my audience who I was.\n\n00:13:03.468 --> 00:13:07.373\nWhat are we really seeking, though,\nwhen we ask where someone comes from?\n\n00:13:07.397 --> 00:13:10.338\nAnd what are we really seeing\nwhen we hear an answer?\n\n00:13:10.957 -->

I love my job.But people think it's this string of epiphanies and sunrises and rainbows, when in reality, it looks more something like this.(Laughter)This is my office.We can't afford the fanciest places to stay at night, so we tend to sleep a lot outdoors. As long as we can stay dry, that's a bonus. We also can't afford the fanciest restaurants. So we tend to eat whatever's on the local menu. And if you're in the Ecuadorian P\u00e1ramo, you're going to eat a large rodent called a cuy.(Laughter)But what makes our experiences perhaps a little bit different and a little more unique than that of the average person is that we have this gnawing thing in the back of our mind that even in our darkest moments, and those times of despair, we think, \"Hey, there might be an image to be made here, there might be a story to be told.\"And why is storytelling important? Well, it helps us to connect with our cultural and our natural heritage. And in the Southeast, there's an alarming disconnect between the public and the natural areas that allow us to be here in the first place. We're visual creatures, so we use what we see to teach us what we know.Now the majority of us aren't going to willingly go way down to a swamp. So how can we still expect those same people to then advocate on behalf of their protection? We can't.So my job, then, is to use photography as a communication tool, to help bridge the gap between the science and the aesthetics, to get people talking, to get them thinking, and to hopefully, ultimately, get them caring.I started doing this 15 years ago right here in Gainesville, right here in my backyard. And I fell in love with adventure and discovery, going to explore all these different places that were just minutes from my front doorstep. There are a lot of beautiful places to find. Despite all these years that have passed, I still see the world through the eyes of a child and I try to incorporate that sense of wonderment and that sense of curiosity into my photography as often as I can.And we're pretty lucky because here in the South, we're still blessed with a relatively blank canvas that we can fill with the most fanciful adventures and incredible experiences. It's just a matter of how far our imagination will take us. See, a lot of people look at this and they say, \"Oh yeah, wow, that's a pretty tree.\" But I don't just see a tree \u2014 I look at this and I see opportunity. I see an entire weekend. Because when I was a kid, these were the types of images that got me off the sofa and dared me to explore, dared me to go find the woods and put my head underwater and see what we have.And folks, I've been photographing all over the world and I promise you, what we have here in the South, what we have in the Sunshine State, rivals anything else that I've seen. But yet our tourism industry is busy promoting all the wrong things. Before most kids are 12, they'll have been to Disney World more times than they've been in a canoe or camping under a starry sky. And I have nothing against Disney or Mickey; I used to go there, too. But they're missing out on those fundamental connections that create a real sense of pride and ownership for the place that they call home.And this is compounded by the issue that the landscapes that define our natural heritage and fuel our aquifer for our drinking water have been deemed as scary and dangerous and spooky. When our ancestors first came here, they warned, \"Stay out of these areas, they're haunted. They're full of evil spirits and ghosts.\" I don't know where they came up with that idea. But it's actually led to a very real disconnect, a very real negative mentality that has kept the public disinterested, silent, and ultimately, our environment at risk. We're a state that's surrounded and defined by water, and yet for centuries, swamps and wetlands have been regarded as these obstacles to overcome. And so we've treated them as these second-class ecosystems, because they have very little monetary value and of course, they're known to harbor alligators and snakes \u2014 which, I'll admit, these aren't the most cuddly of ambassadors.(Laughter)So it became assumed, then, that the only good swamp was a drained swamp. And in fact, draining a swamp to make way for agriculture and development was considered the very essence of conservation not too long ago.But now we're backpedaling, because the more we come to learn about these sodden landscapes, the more secrets we're starting to unlock about interspecies relationships and the connectivity of habitats, watersheds and flyways. Take this bird, for example: this is the prothonotary warbler. I love this bird because it's a swamp bird, through and through, a swamp bird. They nest and they mate and they breed in these old-growth swamps in these flooded forests. And so after the spring, after they raise their young, they then fly thousand of miles over the Gulf of Mexico into Central and South America. And then after the winter, the spring rolls around and they come back. They fly thousands of miles over the Gulf of Mexico. And where do they go? Where do they land? Right back in the same tree. That's nuts. This is a bird the size of a tennis ball \u2014 I mean, that's crazy! I used a GPS to get here today, and this is my hometown.(Laughter)It's crazy. So what happens, then, when this bird flies over the Gulf of Mexico into Central America for the winter and then the spring rolls around and it flies back, and it comes back to this: a freshly sodded golf course?This is a narrative that's all too commonly unraveling here in this state. And this is a natural process that's occurred for thousands of years and we're just now learning about it. So you can imagine all else we have to learn about these landscapes if we just preserve them first. Now despite all this rich life that abounds in these swamps, they still have a bad name.Many people feel uncomfortable with the idea of wading into Florida's blackwater. I can understand that. But what I loved about growing up in the Sunshine State is that for so many of us, we live with this latent but very palpable fear that when we put our toes into the water, there might be something much more ancient and much more adapted than we are. Knowing that you're not top dog is a welcomed discomfort, I think. How often in this modern and urban and digital age do you actually get the chance to feel vulnerable, or consider that the world may not have been made for just us?So for the last decade, I began seeking out these areas where the concrete yields to forest and the pines turn to cypress, and I viewed all these mosquitoes and reptiles, all these discomforts, as affirmations that I'd found true wilderness, and I embrace them wholly. Now as a conservation photographer obsessed with blackwater, it's only fitting that I'd eventually end up in the most famous swamp of all: the Everglades.Growing up here in North Central Florida, it always had these enchanted names, places like Loxahatchee and Fakahatchee, Corkscrew, Big Cypress. I started what turned into a five-year project to hopefully reintroduce the Everglades in a new light, in a more inspired light. But I knew this would be a tall order, because here you have an area that's roughly a third the size the state of Florida, it's huge. And when I say Everglades, most people are like, \"Oh, yeah, the national park.\" But the Everglades is not just a park; it's an entire watershed, starting with the Kissimmee chain of lakes in the north, and then as the rains would fall in the summer, these downpours would flow into Lake Okeechobee, and Lake Okeechobee would fill up and it would overflow its banks and spill southward, ever slowly, with the topography, and get into the river of grass, the Sawgrass Prairies, before meting into the cypress slews, until going further south into the mangrove swamps, and then finally \u2014 finally \u2014 reaching Florida Bay, the emerald gem of the Everglades, the great estuary, the 850 square-mile estuary.So sure, the national park is the southern end of this system, but all the things that make it unique are these inputs that come in, the fresh water that starts 100 miles north. So no manner of these political or invisible boundaries protect the park from polluted water or insufficient water. And unfortunately, that's precisely what we've done. Over the last 60 years, we have drained, we have dammed, we have dredged the Everglades to where now only one third of the water that used to reach the bay now reaches the bay today. So this story is not all sunshine and rainbows, unfortunately. For better or for worse, the story of the Everglades is intrinsically tied to the peaks and the valleys of mankind's relationship with the natural world.But I'll show you these beautiful pictures, because it gets you on board. And while I have your attention, I can tell you the real story. It's that we're taking this, and we're trading it for this, at an alarming rate. And what's lost on so many people is the sheer scale of which we're discussing. Because the Everglades is not just responsible for the drinking water for 7 million Floridians; today it also provides the agricultural fields for the year-round tomatoes and oranges for over 300 million Americans. And it's that same seasonal pulse of water in the summer that built the river of grass 6,000 years ago. Ironically, today, it's also responsible for the over half a million acres of the endless river of sugarcane. These are the same fields that are responsible for dumping exceedingly high levels of fertilizers into the watershed, forever changing the system.But in order for you to not just understand how this system works, but to also get personally connected to it, I decided to break the story down into several different narratives. And I wanted that story to start in Lake Okeechobee, the beating heart of the Everglade system. And to do that, I picked an ambassador, an iconic species. This is the Everglade snail kite. It's a great bird, and they used to nest in the thousands, thousands in the northern Everglades. And then they've gone down to about 400 nesting pairs today. And why is that? Well, it's because they eat one source of food, an apple snail, about the size of a ping-pong ball, an aquatic gastropod.So as we started damming up the Everglades, as we started diking Lake Okeechobee and draining the wetlands, we lost the habitat for the snail. And thus, the population of the kites declined. And so, I wanted a photo that would not only communicate this relationship between wetland, snail and bird, but I also wanted a photo that would communicate how incredible this relationship was, and how very important it is that they've come to depend on each other, this healthy wetland and this bird. And to do that, I brainstormed this idea. I started sketching out these plans to make a photo, and I sent it to the wildlife biologist down in Okeechobee \u2014 this is an endangered bird, so it takes special permission to do. So I built this submerged platform that would hold snails just right under the water. And I spent months planning this crazy idea. And I took this platform down to Lake Okeechobee and I spent over a week in the water, wading waist-deep, 9-hour shifts from dawn until dusk, to get one image that I thought might communicate this. And here's the day that it finally worked:[Video: (Mac Stone narrating) After setting up the platform, I look off and I see a kite coming over the cattails. And I see him scanning and searching. And he gets right over the trap, and I see that he's seen it. And he beelines, he goes straight for the trap. And in that moment, all those months of planning, waiting, all the sunburn, mosquito bites \u2014 suddenly, they're all worth it. (Mac Stone in film) Oh my gosh, I can't believe it!]You can believe how excited I was when that happened. But what the idea was, is that for someone who's never seen this bird and has no reason to care about it, these photos, these new perspectives, will help shed a little new light on just one species that makes this watershed so incredible, so valuable, so important. Now, I know I can't come here to Gainesville and talk to you about animals in the Everglades without talking about gators. I love gators, I grew up loving gators. My parents always said I had an unhealthy relationship with gators. But what I like about them is, they're like the freshwater equivalent of sharks. They're feared, they're hated, and they are tragically misunderstood. Because these are a unique species, they're not just apex predators. In the Everglades, they are the very architects of the Everglades, because as the water drops down in the winter during the dry season, they start excavating these holes called gator holes. And they do this because as the water drops down, they'll be able to stay wet and they'll be able to forage. And now this isn't just affecting them, other animals also depend on this relationship, so they become a keystone species as well. So how do you make an apex predator, an ancient reptile, at once look like it dominates the system, but at the same time, look vulnerable? Well, you wade into a pit of about 120 of them, then you hope that you've made the right decision.(Laughter)I still have all my fingers, it's cool.But I understand, I know I'm not going to rally you guys, I'm not going to rally the troops to \"Save the Everglades for the gators!\" It won't happen because they're so ubiquitous, we see them now, they're one of the great conservation success stories of the US. But there is one species in the Everglades that no matter who you are, you can't help but love, too, and that's the roseate spoonbill. These birds are great, but they've had a really tough time in the Everglades, because they started out with thousands of nesting pairs in Florida Bay, and at the turn of the 20th century, they got down to two \u2014 two nesting pairs. And why? That's because women thought they looked better on their hats then they did flying in the sky. Then we banned the plume trade, and their numbers started rebounding. And as their numbers started rebounding, scientists began to pay attention, they started studying these birds.And what they found out is that these birds' behavior is intrinsically tied to the annual draw-down cycle of water in the Everglades, the thing that defines the Everglades watershed. What they found out is that these birds started nesting in the winter as the water drew down, because they're tactile feeders, so they have to touch whatever they eat. And so they wait for these concentrated pools of fish to be able to feed enough to feed their young. So these birds became the very icon of the Everglades \u2014 an indicator species of the overall health of the system. And just as their numbers were rebounding in the mid-20th century \u2014 shooting up to 900, 1,000, 1,100, 1,200 \u2014 just as that started happening, we started draining the southern Everglades. And we stopped two-thirds of that water from moving south. And it had drastic consequences. And just as those numbers started reaching their peak, unfortunately, today, the real spoonbill story, the real photo of what it looks like is more something like this. And we're down to less than 70 nesting pairs in Florida Bay today, because we've disrupted the system so much. So all these different organizations are shouting, they're screaming, \"The Everglades is fragile! It's fragile!\" It is not. It is resilient. Because despite all we've taken, despite all we've done and we've drained and we've dammed and we've dredged it, pieces of it are still here, waiting to be put back together.And this is what I've loved about South Florida, that in one place, you have this unstoppable force of mankind meeting the immovable object of tropical nature. And it's at this new frontier that we are forced with a new appraisal. What is wilderness worth? What is the value of biodiversity, or our drinking water? And fortunately, after decades of debate, we're finally starting to act on those questions. We're slowly undertaking these projects to bring more freshwater back to the bay. But it's up to us as citizens, as residents, as stewards to hold our elected officials to their promises.What can you do to help? It's so easy. Just get outside, get out there. Take your friends out, take your kids out, take your family out. Hire a fishing guide. Show the state that protecting wilderness not only makes ecological sense, but economic sense as well. It's a lot of fun, just do it \u2014 put your feet in the water. The swamp will change you, I promise.Over the years, we've been so generous with these other landscapes around the country, cloaking them with this American pride, places that we now consider to define us: Grand Canyon, Yosemite, Yellowstone. And we use these parks and these natural areas as beacons and as cultural compasses. And sadly, the Everglades is very commonly left out of that conversation. But I believe it's every bit as iconic and emblematic of who we are as a country as any of these other wildernesses. It's just a different kind of wild.But I'm encouraged, because maybe we're finally starting to come around, because what was once deemed this swampy wasteland, today is a World Heritage site. It's a wetland of international importance. And we've come a long way in the last 60 years. And as the world's largest and most ambitious wetland restoration project, the international spotlight is on us in the Sunshine State. Because if we can heal this system, it's going to become an icon for wetland restoration all over the world. But it's up to us to decide which legacy we want to attach our flag to.They say that the Everglades is our greatest test. If we pass it, we get to keep the planet. I love that quote, because it's a challenge, it's a prod. Can we do it? Will we do it? We have to, we must. But the Everglades is not just a test. It's also a gift, and ultimately, our responsibility.Thank you.(Applause)", "id": 2334, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:12.616 --> 00:00:14.672\nSo I've

00:01:43.805\nway down to a swamp.\n\n00:01:44.596 --> 00:01:48.190\nSo how can we still expect\nthose same people to then advocate\n\n00:01:48.214 --> 00:01:49.932\non behalf of their protection?\n\n00:01:50.368 --> 00:01:51.542\nWe can't.\n\n00:01:51.566 --> 00:01:55.811\nSo my job, then, is to use photography\nas a communication tool,\n\n00:01:55.835 --> 00:01:59.810\nto help bridge the gap\nbetween the science and the aesthetics,\n\n00:01:59.834 --> 00:02:01.452\nto get people talking,\n\n00:02:01.476 --> 00:02:02.845\nto get them thinking,\n\n00:02:02.869 --> 00:02:04.526\nand to hopefully, ultimately,\n\n00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:05.941\nget them caring.\n\n00:02:06.799 --> 00:02:09.709\nI started doing this 15 years ago\nright here in Gainesville,\n\n00:02:09.733 --> 00:02:11.608\nright here in my backyard.\n\n00:02:11.632 --> 00:02:14.480\nAnd I fell in love\nwith adventure and discovery,\n\n00:02:14.504 --> 00:02:16.561\ngoing to explore\nall these different places\n\n00:02:16.585 --> 00:02:18.878\nthat were just minutes\nfrom my front doorstep.\n\n00:02:18.902 --> 00:02:21.490\nThere are a lot\nof beautiful places to find.\n\n00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:24.132\nDespite all these years that have passed,\n\n00:02:24.156 --> 00:02:26.450\nI still see the world\nthrough the eyes of a child\n\n00:02:26.474 --> 00:02:29.327\nand I try to incorporate\nthat sense of wonderment\n\n00:02:29.351 --> 00:02:34.032\nand that sense of curiosity\ninto my photography\n\n00:02:34.056 --> 00:02:35.806\nas often as I can.\n\n00:02:36.964 --> 00:02:39.262\nAnd we're pretty lucky\nbecause here in the South,\n\n00:02:39.286 --> 00:02:42.358\nwe're still blessed\nwith a relatively blank canvas\n\n00:02:42.382 --> 00:02:45.566\nthat we can fill with the most\nfanciful adventures\n\n00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:48.037\nand incredible experiences.\n\n00:02:48.061 --> 00:02:52.005\nIt's just a matter of how far\nour imagination will take us.\n\n00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:54.559\nSee, a lot of people\nlook at this and they say,\n\n00:02:54.583 --> 00:02:56.361\n\"Oh yeah, wow, that's a pretty tree.\"\n\n00:02:56.385 --> 00:02:57.856\nBut I don't just see a tree --\n\n00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:00.459\nI look at this and I see opportunity.\n\n00:03:00.483 --> 00:03:02.080\nI see an entire weekend.\n\n00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:05.717\nBecause when I was a kid,\nthese were the types of images\n\n00:03:05.741 --> 00:03:08.209\nthat got me off the sofa\nand dared me to explore,\n\n00:03:08.233 --> 00:03:09.674\ndared me to go find the woods\n\n00:03:09.698 --> 00:03:12.593\nand put my head underwater\nand see what we have.\n\n00:03:13.391 --> 00:03:16.192\nAnd folks, I've been photographing\nall over the world\n\n00:03:16.216 --> 00:03:17.557\nand I promise you,\n\n00:03:17.581 --> 00:03:19.076\nwhat we have here in the South,\n\n00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:20.781\nwhat we have in the Sunshine State,\n\n00:03:20.805 --> 00:03:23.100\nrivals anything else that I've seen.\n\n00:03:23.901 --> 00:03:27.913\nBut yet our tourism industry is busy\npromoting all the wrong things.\n\n00:03:28.656 --> 00:03:31.387\nBefore most kids are 12,\nthey'll have been to Disney World\n\n00:03:31.411 --> 00:03:33.372\nmore times than they've been in a canoe\n\n00:03:33.396 --> 00:03:36.238\nor camping under a starry sky.\n\n00:03:36.774 --> 00:03:40.321\nAnd I have nothing against Disney\nor Mickey; I used to go there, too.\n\n00:03:40.345 --> 00:03:43.004\nBut they're missing out on those\nfundamental connections\n\n00:03:43.028 --> 00:03:46.250\nthat create a real sense\nof pride and ownership\n\n00:03:46.274 --> 00:03:48.377\nfor the place that they call home.\n\n00:03:49.209 --> 00:03:52.248\nAnd this is compounded by the issue\nthat the landscapes\n\n00:03:52.272 --> 00:03:54.381\nthat define our natural heritage\n\n00:03:54.405 --> 00:03:57.381\nand fuel our aquifer\nfor our drinking water\n\n00:03:57.405 --> 00:04:01.848\nhave been deemed as scary\nand dangerous and spooky.\n\n00:04:02.287 --> 00:04:04.040\nWhen our ancestors first came here,\n\n00:04:04.064 --> 00:04:06.700\nthey warned, \"Stay out\nof these areas, they're haunted.\n\n00:04:06.724 --> 00:04:09.821\nThey're full of evil spirits and ghosts.\"\n\n00:04:09.845 --> 00:04:12.191\nI don't know where\nthey came up with that idea.\n\n00:04:12.762 --> 00:04:15.394\nBut it's actually led\nto a very real disconnect,\n\n00:04:15.418 --> 00:04:17.179\na very real negative mentality\n\n00:04:17.203 --> 00:04:20.781\nthat has kept the public\ndisinterested, silent,\n\n00:04:20.805 --> 00:04:23.370\nand ultimately, our environment at risk.\n\n00:04:24.481 --> 00:04:27.933\nWe're a state that's surrounded\nand defined by water,\n\n00:04:27.957 --> 00:04:29.233\nand yet for centuries,\n\n00:04:29.257 --> 00:04:31.150\nswamps and wetlands have been regarded\n\n00:04:31.174 --> 00:04:33.881\nas these obstacles to overcome.\n\n00:04:34.325 --> 00:04:38.307\nAnd so we've treated them\nas these second-class ecosystems,\n\n00:04:38.331 --> 00:04:40.595\nbecause they have\nvery little monetary value\n\n00:04:40.619 --> 00:04:44.304\nand of course, they're known\nto harbor alligators and snakes --\n\n00:04:44.328 --> 00:04:47.626\nwhich, I'll admit, these aren't\nthe most cuddly of ambassadors.\n\n00:04:47.650 --> 00:04:48.786\n(Laughter)\n\n00:04:48.810 --> 00:04:51.588\nSo it became assumed, then,\nthat the only good swamp\n\n00:04:51.612 --> 00:04:52.930\nwas a drained swamp.\n\n00:04:53.322 --> 00:04:54.473\nAnd in fact,\n\n00:04:54.497 --> 00:04:57.908\ndraining a swamp to make way\nfor agriculture and development\n\n00:04:57.932 --> 00:05:01.845\nwas considered the very essence\nof conservation not too long ago.\n\n00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:04.026\nBut now we're backpedaling,\n\n00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:07.401\nbecause the more we come to learn\nabout these sodden landscapes,\n\n00:05:07.425 --> 00:05:09.391\nthe more secrets we're starting to unlock\n\n00:05:09.415 --> 00:05:11.778\nabout interspecies relationships\n\n00:05:11.802 --> 00:05:16.352\nand the connectivity of habitats,\nwatersheds and flyways.\n\n00:05:16.998 --> 00:05:18.983\nTake this bird, for example:\n\n00:05:19.007 --> 00:05:20.895\nthis is the prothonotary warbler.\n\n00:05:20.919 --> 00:05:23.105\nI love this bird because\nit's a swamp bird,\n\n00:05:23.129 --> 00:05:24.833\nthrough and through, a swamp bird.\n\n00:05:24.857 --> 00:05:28.505\nThey nest and they mate and they breed\nin these old-growth swamps\n\n00:05:28.529 --> 00:05:29.993\nin these flooded forests.\n\n00:05:30.017 --> 00:05:32.565\nAnd so after the spring,\nafter they raise their young,\n\n00:05:32.589 --> 00:05:35.394\nthey then fly thousand of miles\nover the Gulf of Mexico\n\n00:05:35.418 --> 00:05:37.367\ninto Central and South America.\n\n00:05:37.764 --> 00:05:39.016\nAnd then after the winter,\n\n00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:41.055\nthe spring rolls around\nand they come back.\n\n00:05:41.079 --> 00:05:43.978\nThey fly thousands of miles\nover the Gulf of Mexico.\n\n00:05:44.002 --> 00:05:46.908\nAnd where do they go? Where do they land?\n\n00:05:47.432 --> 00:05:49.948\nRight back in the same tree.\n\n00:05:50.644 --> 00:05:51.794\nThat's nuts.\n\n00:05:52.109 --> 00:05:55.456\nThis is a bird the size\nof a tennis ball --\n\n00:05:55.480 --> 00:05:57.157\nI mean, that's crazy!\n\n00:05:57.181 --> 00:05:59.731\nI used a GPS to get here today,\n\n00:05:59.755 --> 00:06:01.422\nand this is my hometown.\n\n00:06:01.446 --> 00:06:02.717\n(Laughter)\n\n00:06:02.741 --> 00:06:03.898\nIt's crazy.\n\n00:06:04.332 --> 00:06:08.022\nSo what happens, then, when this bird\nflies over the Gulf of Mexico\n\n00:06:08.046 --> 00:06:09.914\ninto Central America for the winter\n\n00:06:09.938 --> 00:06:12.379\nand then the spring rolls around\nand it flies back,\n\n00:06:12.403 --> 00:06:15.170\nand it comes back to this:\n\n00:06:15.194 --> 00:06:17.088\na freshly sodded golf course?\n\n00:06:17.900 --> 00:06:20.489\nThis is a narrative that's\nall too commonly unraveling\n\n00:06:20.513 --> 00:06:21.700\nhere in this state.\n\n00:06:21.724 --> 00:06:24.963\nAnd this is a natural process\nthat's occurred for thousands of years\n\n00:06:24.987 --> 00:06:26.765\nand we're just now learning about it.\n\n00:06:26.789 --> 00:06:29.952\nSo you can imagine all else we have\nto learn about these landscapes\n\n00:06:29.976 --> 00:06:31.834\nif we just preserve them first.\n\n00:06:31.858 --> 00:06:36.389\nNow despite all this rich life\nthat abounds in these swamps,\n\n00:06:36.413 --> 00:06:38.237\nthey still have a bad name.\n\n00:06:38.786 --> 00:06:42.452\nMany people feel uncomfortable\nwith the idea of wading\n\n00:06:42.476 --> 00:06:44.140\ninto Florida's blackwater.\n\n00:06:44.164 --> 00:06:45.953\nI can understand that.\n\n00:06:45.977 --> 00:06:49.118\nBut what I loved about growing up\nin the Sunshine State\n\n00:06:49.142 --> 00:06:50.424\nis that for so many of us,\n\n00:06:50.448 --> 00:06:54.237\nwe live with this latent\nbut very palpable fear\n\n00:06:54.261 --> 00:06:56.602\nthat when we put our toes into the water,\n\n00:06:56.626 --> 00:06:59.608\nthere might be something much more ancient\n\n00:06:59.632 --> 00:07:01.769\nand much more adapted than we are.\n\n00:07:02.622 --> 00:07:07.421\nKnowing that you're not top dog\nis a welcomed discomfort, I think.\n\n00:07:08.040 --> 00:07:11.926\nHow often in this modern\nand urban and digital age\n\n00:07:11.950 --> 00:07:15.594\ndo you actually get the chance\nto feel vulnerable,\n\n00:07:15.618 --> 00:07:19.784\nor consider that the world may not\nhave been made for just us?\n\n00:07:19.808 --> 00:07:21.090\nSo for the last decade,\n\n00:07:21.114 --> 00:07:24.509\nI began seeking out these areas\nwhere the concrete yields to forest\n\n00:07:24.533 --> 00:07:26.711\nand the pines turn to cypress,\n\n00:07:26.735 --> 00:07:30.380\nand I viewed all these\nmosquitoes and reptiles,\n\n00:07:30.404 --> 00:07:31.903\nall these discomforts,\n\n00:07:31.927 --> 00:07:35.459\nas affirmations that I'd found\ntrue wilderness,\n\n00:07:35.483 --> 00:07:37.643\nand I embrace them wholly.\n\n00:07:37.667 --> 00:07:41.070\nNow as a conservation photographer\nobsessed with blackwater,\n\n00:07:41.094 --> 00:07:43.214\nit's only fitting that I'd\neventually end up\n\n00:07:43.238 --> 00:07:45.415\nin the most famous swamp of all:\n\n00:07:45.439 --> 00:07:46.689\nthe Everglades.\n\n00:07:47.102 --> 00:07:49.071\nGrowing up here in North Central Florida,\n\n00:07:49.095 --> 00:07:50.825\nit always had these enchanted names,\n\n00:07:50.849 --> 00:07:54.191\nplaces like Loxahatchee and Fakahatchee,\n\n00:07:54.215 --> 00:07:56.337\nCorkscrew, Big Cypress.\n\n00:07:56.361 --> 00:07:59.901\nI started what turned\ninto a five-year project\n\n00:07:59.925 --> 00:08:03.675\nto hopefully reintroduce\nthe Everglades in a new light,\n\n00:08:03.699 --> 00:08:05.380\nin a more inspired light.\n\n00:08:05.880 --> 00:08:09.105\nBut I knew this would be a tall order,\nbecause here you have an area\n\n00:08:09.129 --> 00:08:12.158\nthat's roughly a third the size\nthe state of Florida, it's huge.\n\n00:08:12.182 --> 00:08:13.459\nAnd when I say Everglades,\n\n00:08:13.483 --> 00:08:15.951\nmost people are like,\n\"Oh, yeah, the national park.\"\n\n00:08:15.975 --> 00:08:20.988\nBut the Everglades is not just a park;\nit's an entire watershed,\n\n00:08:21.012 --> 00:08:24.017\nstarting with the Kissimmee\nchain of lakes in the north,\n\n00:08:24.041 --> 00:08:26.266\nand then as the rains\nwould fall in the summer,\n\n00:08:26.290 --> 00:08:28.922\nthese downpours would flow\ninto Lake Okeechobee,\n\n00:08:28.946 --> 00:08:32.193\nand Lake Okeechobee would fill up\nand it would overflow its banks\n\n00:08:32.217 --> 00:08:35.491\nand spill southward, ever slowly,\nwith the topography,\n\n00:08:35.515 --> 00:08:38.111\nand get into the river of grass,\nthe Sawgrass Prairies,\n\n00:08:38.135 --> 00:08:40.180\nbefore meting into the cypress slews,\n\n00:08:40.204 --> 00:08:42.891\nuntil going further south\ninto the mangrove swamps,\n\n00:08:42.915 --> 00:08:46.665\nand then finally -- finally --\nreaching Florida Bay,\n\n00:08:46.689 --> 00:08:48.462\nthe emerald gem of the Everglades,\n\n00:08:48.486 --> 00:08:49.669\nthe great estuary,\n\n00:08:49.693 --> 00:08:51.946\nthe 850 square-mile estuary.\n\n00:08:52.422 --> 00:08:56.755\nSo sure, the national park\nis the southern end of this system,\n\n00:08:56.779 --> 00:09:00.082\nbut all the things that make it unique\nare these inputs that come in,\n\n00:09:00.106 --> 00:09:02.913\nthe fresh water that starts\n100 miles north.\n\n00:09:02.937 --> 00:09:06.202\nSo no manner of these political\nor invisible boundaries\n\n00:09:06.226 --> 00:09:10.613\nprotect the park from polluted water\nor insufficient water.\n\n00:09:11.200 --> 00:09:14.026\nAnd unfortunately, that's precisely\nwhat we've done.\n\n00:09:14.588 --> 00:09:16.121\nOver the last 60 years,\n\n00:09:16.145 --> 00:09:19.502\nwe have drained, we have dammed,\nwe have dredged the Everglades\n\n00:09:19.526 --> 00:09:23.507\nto where now only one third of the water\nthat used to reach the bay\n\n00:09:23.531 --> 00:09:25.538\nnow reaches the bay today.\n\n00:09:26.544 --> 00:09:30.212\nSo this story is not all sunshine\nand rainbows, unfortunately.\n\n00:09:30.911 --> 00:09:32.797\nFor better or for worse,\n\n00:09:32.821 --> 00:09:36.238\nthe story of the Everglades\nis intrinsically tied\n\n00:09:36.262 --> 00:09:39.458\nto the peaks and the valleys\nof mankind's relationship\n\n00:09:39.482 --> 00:09:40.822\nwith the natural world.\n\n00:09:41.213 --> 00:09:43.238\nBut I'll show you\nthese beautiful pictures,\n\n00:09:43.262 --> 00:09:44.723\nbecause it gets you on board.\n\n00:09:44.747 --> 00:09:47.875\nAnd while I have your attention,\nI can tell you the real story.\n\n00:09:47.899 --> 00:09:49.850\nIt's that we're taking this,\n\n00:09:49.874 --> 00:09:52.837\nand we're trading it for this,\n\n00:09:52.861 --> 00:09:54.356\nat an alarming rate.\n\n00:09:55.316 --> 00:09:57.026\nAnd what's lost on so many people\n\n00:09:57.050 --> 00:09:59.561\nis the sheer scale\nof which we're discussing.\n\n00:09:59.585 --> 00:10:03.013\nBecause the Everglades is not just\nresponsible for the drinking water\n\n00:10:03.037 --> 00:10:05.241\nfor 7 million Floridians;\n\n00:10:05.265 --> 00:10:07.803\ntoday it also provides\nthe agricultural fields\n\n00:10:07.827 --> 00:10:10.386\nfor the year-round tomatoes and oranges\n\n00:10:10.410 --> 00:10:13.241\nfor over 300 million Americans.\n\n00:10:14.349 --> 00:10:17.663\nAnd it's that same seasonal pulse\nof water in the summer\n\n00:10:17.687 --> 00:10:21.580\nthat built the river of grass\n6,000 years ago.\n\n00:10:22.242 --> 00:10:26.620\nIronically, today, it's also responsible\nfor the over half a million acres\n\n00:10:26.644 --> 00:10:29.099\nof the endless river of sugarcane.\n\n00:10:29.857 --> 00:10:32.026\nThese are the same fields\nthat are responsible\n\n00:10:32.050 --> 00:10:36.074\nfor dumping exceedingly high levels\nof fertilizers into the watershed,\n\n00:10:36.098 --> 00:10:38.261\nforever changing the system.\n\n00:10:38.707 --> 00:10:41.919\nBut in order for you to not just\nunderstand how this system works,\n\n00:10:41.943 --> 00:10:44.006\nbut to also get personally\nconnected to it,\n\n00:10:44.030 --> 00:10:47.305\nI decided to break the story down\ninto several different narratives.\n\n00:10:47.329 --> 00:10:50.117\nAnd I wanted that story to start\nin Lake Okeechobee,\n\n00:10:50.141 --> 00:10:52.888\nthe beating heart of the Everglade system.\n\n00:10:52.912 --> 00:10:55.375\nAnd to do that, I picked an ambassador,\n\n00:10:55.399 --> 00:10:56.648\nan iconic species.\n\n00:10:57.162 --> 00:10:59.154\nThis is the Everglade snail kite.\n\n00:10:59.678 --> 00:11:00.924\nIt's a great bird,\n\n00:11:00.948 --> 00:11:02.822\nand they used to nest in the thousands,\n\n00:11:02.846 --> 00:11:04.649\nthousands in the northern Everglades.\n\n00:11:04.673 --> 00:11:08.177\nAnd then they've gone down\nto about 400 nesting pairs today.\n\n00:11:08.201 --> 00:11:09.546\nAnd why is that?\n\n00:11:09.570 --> 00:11:12.694\nWell, it's because they eat\none source of food, an apple snail,\n\n00:11:12.718 --> 00:11:16.119\nabout the size of a ping-pong ball,\nan aquatic gastropod.\n\n00:11:16.143 --> 00:11:19.368\nSo as we started damming up\nthe Everglades,\n\n00:11:19.392 --> 00:11:22.869\nas we started diking Lake Okeechobee\nand draining the wetlands,\n\n00:11:22.893 --> 00:11:25.005\nwe lost the habitat for the snail.\n\n00:11:25.029 --> 00:11:27.821\nAnd thus, the population\nof the kites declined.\n\n00:11:28.412 --> 00:11:31.908\nAnd so, I wanted a photo that would\nnot only communicate this relationship\n\n00:11:31.932 --> 00:11:35.021\nbetween wetland, snail and bird,\n\n00:11:35.045 --> 00:11:37.294\nbut I also wanted a photo\nthat would communicate\n\n00:11:37.318 --> 00:11:40.112\nhow incredible this relationship was,\n\n00:11:40.136 --> 00:11:44.292\nand how very important it is\nthat they've come to depend on each other,\n\n00:11:44.316 --> 00:11:45.983\nthis healthy wetland and this bird.\n\n00:11:46.007 --> 00:11:47.979\nAnd to do that, I brainstormed this idea.\n\n00:11:48.003 --> 00:11:51.241\nI started sketching\nout these plans to make a photo,\n\n00:11:51.265 --> 00:11:54.152\nand I sent it to the wildlife biologist\ndown in Okeechobee --\n\n00:11:54.176 --> 00:11:57.263\nthis is an endangered bird,\nso it takes special permission to do.\n\n00:11:57.287 --> 00:11:58.981\nSo I built this submerged platform\n\n00:11:59.005 --> 00:12:01.487\nthat would hold snails\njust right under the water.\n\n00:12:01.511 --> 00:12:05.969\nAnd I spent months planning\nthis crazy idea.\n\n00:12:05.993 --> 00:12:08.969\nAnd I took this platform\ndown to Lake Okeechobee\n\n00:12:08.993 --> 00:12:11.065\nand I spent over a week in the water,\n\n00:12:11.089 --> 00:12:14.805\nwading waist-deep,\n9-hour shifts from dawn until dusk,\n\n00:12:14.829 --> 00:12:17.989\nto get one image that I thought\nmight communicate this.\n\n00:12:18.013 --> 00:12:20.228\nAnd here's the day that it finally worked:\n\n00:12:20.252 --> 00:12:23.109\n[Video: (Mac Stone narrating)\nAfter setting up the platform,\n\n00:12:23.133 --> 00:12:25.670\nI look off and I see a kite\ncoming over the cattails.\n\n00:12:25.694 --> 00:12:27.616\nAnd I see him scanning and searching.\n\n00:12:27.640 --> 00:12:29.245\nAnd he gets right over the trap,\n\n00:12:29.269 --> 00:12:30.790\nand I see that he's seen it.\n\n00:12:30.814 --> 00:12:33.537\nAnd he beelines,\nhe goes straight for the trap.\n\n00:12:33.561 --> 00:12:36.717\nAnd in that moment,\nall those months of planning, waiting,\n\n00:12:36.741 --> 00:12:38.851\nall the sunburn, mosquito bites --\n\n00:12:38.875 --> 00:12:41.413\nsuddenly, they're all worth it.\n\n00:12:41.437 --> 00:12:45.352\n(Mac Stone in film) Oh my gosh,\nI can't believe it!]\n\n00:12:45.653 --> 00:12:48.250\nYou can believe how excited I was\nwhen that happened.\n\n00:12:48.274 --> 00:12:49.614\nBut what the idea was,\n\n00:12:49.638 --> 00:12:51.837\nis that for someone\nwho's never seen this bird\n\n00:12:51.861 --> 00:12:53.931\nand has no reason to care about it,\n\n00:12:53.955 --> 00:12:56.580\nthese photos, these new perspectives,\n\n00:12:56.604 --> 00:12:59.726\nwill help shed a little new light\non just one species\n\n00:12:59.750 --> 00:13:04.032\nthat makes this watershed\nso incredible, so valuable, so important.\n\n00:13:04.573 --> 00:13:07.496\nNow, I know I can't come\nhere to Gainesville\n\n00:13:07.520 --> 00:13:09.766\nand talk to you about animals\nin the Everglades\n\n00:13:09.790 --> 00:13:11.578\nwithout talking about gators.\n\n00:13:11.602 --> 00:13:13.892\nI love gators, I grew up loving gators.\n\n00:13:14.319 --> 00:13:17.735\nMy parents always said I had\nan unhealthy relationship with gators.\n\n00:13:17.759 --> 00:13:19.227\nBut what I like about them is,\n\n00:13:19.251 --> 00:13:21.855\nthey're like the freshwater\nequivalent of sharks.\n\n00:13:21.879 --> 00:13:23.527\nThey're feared, they're hated,\n\n00:13:23.551 --> 00:13:25.915\nand they are tragically misunderstood.\n\n00:13:26.344 --> 00:13:30.108\nBecause these are a unique species,\nthey're not just apex predators.\n\n00:13:30.132 --> 00:13:31.422\nIn the Everglades,\n\n00:13:31.446 --> 00:13:33.940\nthey are the very architects\nof the Everglades,\n\n00:13:33.964 --> 00:13:36.107\nbecause as the water drops\ndown in the winter\n\n00:13:36.131 --> 00:13:37.289\nduring the dry season,\n\n00:13:37.313 --> 00:13:40.335\nthey start excavating these holes\ncalled gator holes.\n\n00:13:40.359 --> 00:13:42.669\nAnd they do this because\nas the water drops down,\n\n00:13:42.693 --> 00:13:46.080\nthey'll be able to stay wet\nand they'll be able to forage.\n\n00:13:46.603 --> 00:13:48.922\nAnd now this isn't just affecting them,\n\n00:13:48.946 --> 00:13:51.179\nother animals also depend\non this relationship,\n\n00:13:51.203 --> 00:13:53.881\nso they become a keystone species as well.\n\n00:13:54.635 --> 00:13:58.870\nSo how do you make an apex predator,\nan ancient reptile,\n\n00:13:58.894 --> 00:14:01.372\nat once look like it dominates the system,\n\n00:14:01.396 --> 00:14:03.839\nbut at the same time, look vulnerable?\n\n00:14:04.664 --> 00:14:08.707\nWell, you wade into a pit\nof about 120 of them,\n\n00:14:08.731 --> 00:14:11.137\nthen you hope that you've made\nthe right decision.\n\n00:14:11.161 --> 00:14:12.925\n(Laughter)\n\n00:14:13.913 --> 00:14:15.873\nI still have all my fingers, it's cool.\n\n00:14:16.635 --> 00:14:19.337\nBut I understand, I know\nI'm not going to rally you guys,\n\n00:14:19.361 --> 00:14:22.971\nI'm not going to rally the troops to\n\"Save the Everglades for the gators!\"\n\n00:14:22.995 --> 00:14:25.193\nIt won't happen because\nthey're so ubiquitous,\n\n00:14:25.217 --> 00:14:26.368\nwe see them now,\n\n00:14:26.392 --> 00:14:29.734\nthey're one of the great conservation\nsuccess stories of the US.\n\n00:14:29.758 --> 00:14:33.084\nBut there is one species in the Everglades\nthat no matter who you are,\n\n00:14:33.108 --> 00:14:36.187\nyou can't help but love, too,\nand that's the roseate spoonbill.\n\n00:14:36.211 --> 00:14:39.842\nThese birds are great, but they've had\na really tough time in the Everglades,\n\n00:14:39.866 --> 00:14:43.332\nbecause they started out with thousands\nof nesting pairs in Florida Bay,\n\n00:14:43.356 --> 00:14:45.419\nand at the turn of the 20th century,\n\n00:14:45.443 --> 00:14:49.035\nthey got down to two -- two nesting pairs.\n\n00:14:49.059 --> 00:14:50.223\nAnd why?\n\n00:14:50.639 --> 00:14:53.535\nThat's because women thought\nthey looked better on their hats\n\n00:14:53.559 --> 00:14:55.572\nthen they did flying in the sky.\n\n00:14:56.282 --> 00:14:58.691\nThen we banned the plume trade,\n\n00:14:58.715 --> 00:15:00.833\nand their numbers started rebounding.\n\n00:15:00.857 --> 00:15:02.882\nAnd as their numbers started rebounding,\n\n00:15:02.906 --> 00:15:04.645\nscientists began to pay attention,\n\n00:15:04.669 --> 00:15:06.382\nthey started studying these birds.\n\n00:15:06.406 --> 00:15:07.891\nAnd what they found out is that\n\n00:15:07.915 --> 00:15:10.073\nthese birds' behavior\nis intrinsically tied\n\n00:15:10.097 --> 00:15:13.015\nto the annual draw-down\ncycle of water in the Everglades,\n\n00:15:13.039 --> 00:15:15.718\nthe thing that defines\nthe Everglades watershed.\n\n00:15:16.249 --> 00:15:17.786\nWhat they found out is that\n\n00:15:17.810 --> 00:15:20.878\nthese birds started nesting in the winter\nas the water drew down,\n\n00:15:20.902 --> 00:15:24.482\nbecause they're tactile feeders,\nso they have to touch whatever they eat.\n\n00:15:24.506 --> 00:15:27.604\nAnd so they wait for these\nconcentrated pools of fish\n\n00:15:27.628 --> 00:15:30.025\nto be able to feed enough\nto feed their young.\n\n00:15:30.835 --> 00:15:33.824\nSo these birds became the very icon\nof the Everglades --\n\n00:15:33.848 --> 00:15:37.340\nan indicator species\nof the overall health of the system.\n\n00:15:37.364 --> 00:15:40.571\nAnd just as their numbers were rebounding\nin the mid-20th century --\n\n00:15:40.595 --> 00:15:45.244\nshooting up to 900, 1,000, 1,100, 1,200 --\n\n00:15:45.268 --> 00:15:49.024\njust as that started happening, we started\ndraining the southern Everglades.\n\n00:15:49.048 --> 00:15:52.552\nAnd we stopped two-thirds\nof that water from moving south.\n\n00:15:52.576 --> 00:15:55.075\nAnd it had drastic consequences.\n\n00:15:55.542 --> 00:15:58.156\nAnd just as those numbers\nstarted reaching their peak,\n\n00:15:58.180 --> 00:16:01.253\nunfortunately, today,\nthe real spoonbill story,\n\n00:16:01.277 --> 00:16:05.894\nthe real photo of what it looks like\nis more something like this.\n\n00:16:06.965 --> 00:16:11.581\nAnd we're down to less than 70\nnesting pairs in Florida

Surrounded by people, yet utterly alone. Wishing you could reach out, to connect, to comfort, to participate. For 13 long years, that was my reality.Most of us never think twice about talking, about communicating. I've thought a lot about it. I've had a lot of time to think.For the first 12 years of my life, I was a normal, happy, healthy little boy. Then everything changed. I contracted a brain infection. The doctors weren't sure what it was, but they treated me the best they could. However, I progressively got worse. Eventually, I lost my ability to control my movements, make eye contact, and finally, my ability to speak.While in hospital, I desperately wanted to go home. I said to my mother, \"When home?\" Those were the last words I ever spoke with my own voice. I would eventually fail every test for mental awareness. My parents were told I was as good as not there. A vegetable, having the intelligence of a three-month-old baby. They were told to take me home and try to keep me comfortable until I died.My parents, in fact my entire family's lives, became consumed by taking care of me the best they knew how. Their friends drifted away. One year turned to two, two turned to three. It seemed like the person I once was began to disappear. The Lego blocks and electronic circuits I'd loved as a boy were put away. I had been moved out of my bedroom into another more practical one. I had become a ghost, a faded memory of a boy people once knew and loved.Meanwhile, my mind began knitting itself back together. Gradually, my awareness started to return. But no one realized that I had come back to life. I was aware of everything, just like any normal person. I could see and understand everything, but I couldn't find a way to let anybody know. My personality was entombed within a seemingly silent body, a vibrant mind hidden in plain sight within a chrysalis.The stark reality hit me that I was going to spend the rest of my life locked inside myself, totally alone. I was trapped with only my thoughts for company. I would never be rescued. No one would ever show me tenderness. I would never talk to a friend. No one would ever love me. I had no dreams, no hope, nothing to look forward to. Well, nothing pleasant. I lived in fear, and, to put it bluntly, was waiting for death to finally release me, expecting to die all alone in a care home.I don't know if it's truly possible to express in words what it's like not to be able to communicate. Your personality appears to vanish into a heavy fog and all of your emotions and desires are constricted, stifled and muted within you. For me, the worst was the feeling of utter powerlessness. I simply existed. It's a very dark place to find yourself because in a sense, you have vanished. Other people controlled every aspect of my life. They decided what I ate and when. Whether I was laid on my side or strapped into my wheelchair. I often spent my days positioned in front of the TV watching Barney reruns. I think because Barney is so happy and jolly, and I absolutely wasn't, it made it so much worse.I was completely powerless to change anything in my life or people's perceptions of me. I was a silent, invisible observer of how people behaved when they thought no one was watching. Unfortunately, I wasn't only an observer. With no way to communicate, I became the perfect victim: a defenseless object, seemingly devoid of feelings that people used to play out their darkest desires. For more than 10 years, people who were charged with my care abused me physically, verbally and sexually. Despite what they thought, I did feel. The first time it happened, I was shocked and filled with disbelief. How could they do this to me? I was confused. What had I done to deserve this? Part of me wanted to cry and another part wanted to fight. Hurt, sadness and anger flooded through me. I felt worthless. There was no one to comfort me. But neither of my parents knew this was happening. I lived in terror, knowing it would happen again and again. I just never knew when. All I knew was that I would never be the same. I remember once listening to Whitney Houston singing, \"No matter what they take from me, they can't take away my dignity.\" And I thought to myself, \"You want to bet?\"Perhaps my parents could have found out and could have helped. But the years of constant caretaking, having to wake up every two hours to turn me, combined with them essentially grieving the loss of their son, had taken a toll on my mother and father. Following yet another heated argument between my parents, in a moment of despair and desperation, my mother turned to me and told me that I should die. I was shocked, but as I thought about what she had said, I was filled with enormous compassion and love for my mother, yet I could do nothing about it.There were many moments when I gave up, sinking into a dark abyss. I remember one particularly low moment. My dad left me alone in the car while he quickly went to buy something from the store. A random stranger walked past, looked at me and he smiled. I may never know why, but that simple act, the fleeting moment of human connection, transformed how I was feeling, making me want to keep going.My existence was tortured by monotony, a reality that was often too much to bear. Alone with my thoughts, I constructed intricate fantasies about ants running across the floor. I taught myself to tell the time by noticing where the shadows were. As I learned how the shadows moved as the hours of the day passed, I understood how long it would be before I was picked up and taken home. Seeing my father walk through the door to collect me was the best moment of the day.My mind became a tool that I could use to either close down to retreat from my reality or enlarge into a gigantic space that I could fill with fantasies. I hoped that my reality would change and someone would see that I had come back to life. But I had been washed away like a sand castle built too close to the waves, and in my place was the person people expected me to be. To some I was Martin, a vacant shell, the vegetable, deserving of harsh words, dismissal and even abuse. To others, I was the tragically brain-damaged boy who had grown to become a man. Someone they were kind to and cared for. Good or bad, I was a blank canvas onto which different versions of myself were projected.It took someone new to see me in a different way. An aromatherapist began coming to the care home about once a week. Whether through intuition or her attention to details that others failed to notice, she became convinced that I could understand what was being said. She urged my parents to have me tested by experts in augmentative and alternative communication. And within a year, I was beginning to use a computer program to communicate. It was exhilarating, but frustrating at times. I had so many words in my mind, that I couldn't wait to be able to share them. Sometimes, I would say things to myself simply because I could. In myself, I had a ready audience, and I believed that by expressing my thoughts and wishes, others would listen, too.But as I began to communicate more, I realized that it was in fact only just the beginning of creating a new voice for myself. I was thrust into a world I didn't quite know how to function in. I stopped going to the care home and managed to get my first job making photocopies. As simple as this may sound, it was amazing. My new world was really exciting but often quite overwhelming and frightening. I was like a man-child, and as liberating as it often was, I struggled. I also learned that many of those who had known me for a long time found it impossible to abandon the idea of Martin they had in their heads. While those I had only just met struggled to look past the image of a silent man in a wheelchair. I realized that some people would only listen to me if what I said was in line with what they expected. Otherwise, it was disregarded and they did what they felt was best.I discovered that true communication is about more than merely physically conveying a message. It is about getting the message heard and respected. Still, things were going well. My body was slowly getting stronger. I had a job in computing that I loved, and had even got Kojak, the dog I had been dreaming about for years.However, I longed to share my life with someone. I remember staring out the window as my dad drove me home from work, thinking I have so much love inside of me and nobody to give it to. Just as I had resigned myself to being single for the rest of my life, I met Joan. Not only is she the best thing that has ever happened to me, but Joan helped me to challenge my own misconceptions about myself. Joan said it was through my words that she fell in love with me. However, after all I had been through, I still couldn't shake the belief that nobody could truly see beyond my disability and accept me for who I am.I also really struggled to comprehend that I was a man. The first time someone referred to me as a man, it stopped me in my tracks. I felt like looking around and asking, \"Who, me?\" That all changed with Joan. We have an amazing connection and I learned how important it is to communicate openly and honestly. I felt safe, and it gave me the confidence to truly say what I thought. I started to feel whole again, a man worthy of love.I began to reshape my destiny. I spoke up a little more at work. I asserted my need for independence to the people around me. Being given a means of communication changed everything. I used the power of words and will to challenge the preconceptions of those around me and those I had of myself.Communication is what makes us human, enabling us to connect on the deepest level with those around us \u2014 telling our own stories, expressing wants, needs and desires, or hearing those of others by really listening. All this is how the world knows who we are. So who are we without it?True communication increases understanding and creates a more caring and compassionate world. Once, I was perceived to be an inanimate object, a mindless phantom of a boy in a wheelchair. Today, I am so much more. A husband, a son, a friend, a brother, a business owner, a first-class honors graduate, a keen amateur photographer. It is my ability to communicate that has given me all this.We are told that actions speak louder than words. But I wonder, do they? Our words, however we communicate them, are just as powerful. Whether we speak the words with our own voices, type them with our eyes, or communicate them non-verbally to someone who speaks them for us, words are among our most powerful tools.I have come to you through a terrible darkness, pulled from it by caring souls and by language itself. The act of you listening to me today brings me farther into the light. We are shining here together. If there is one most difficult obstacle to my way of communicating, it is that sometimes I want to shout and other times simply to whisper a word of love or gratitude. It all sounds the same. But if you will, please imagine these next two words as warmly as you can:Thank you.(Applause)", "id": 2338, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:12.918 -->

00:03:32.694\nwhat it's like not to be able\nto communicate.\n\n00:03:32.718 --> 00:03:36.134\nYour personality appears\nto vanish into a heavy fog\n\n00:03:36.158 --> 00:03:41.934\nand all of your emotions and desires are\nconstricted, stifled and muted within you.\n\n00:03:41.958 --> 00:03:46.454\nFor me, the worst was the feeling\nof utter powerlessness.\n\n00:03:46.478 --> 00:03:47.918\nI simply existed.\n\n00:03:48.638 --> 00:03:51.094\nIt's a very dark place to find yourself\n\n00:03:51.118 --> 00:03:53.798\nbecause in a sense, you have vanished.\n\n00:03:54.958 --> 00:03:58.174\nOther people controlled\nevery aspect of my life.\n\n00:03:58.198 --> 00:04:00.494\nThey decided what I ate and when.\n\n00:04:00.518 --> 00:04:04.494\nWhether I was laid on my side\nor strapped into my wheelchair.\n\n00:04:04.518 --> 00:04:07.894\nI often spent my days\npositioned in front of the TV\n\n00:04:07.918 --> 00:04:09.758\nwatching Barney reruns.\n\n00:04:10.398 --> 00:04:13.294\nI think because Barney\nis so happy and jolly,\n\n00:04:13.318 --> 00:04:15.054\nand I absolutely wasn't,\n\n00:04:15.078 --> 00:04:16.758\nit made it so much worse.\n\n00:04:17.758 --> 00:04:21.174\nI was completely powerless\nto change anything in my life\n\n00:04:21.198 --> 00:04:23.654\nor people's perceptions of me.\n\n00:04:23.678 --> 00:04:27.254\nI was a silent, invisible observer\nof how people behaved\n\n00:04:27.278 --> 00:04:29.654\nwhen they thought no one was watching.\n\n00:04:29.678 --> 00:04:33.374\nUnfortunately, I wasn't only an observer.\n\n00:04:33.398 --> 00:04:37.374\nWith no way to communicate,\nI became the perfect victim:\n\n00:04:37.398 --> 00:04:41.374\na defenseless object,\nseemingly devoid of feelings\n\n00:04:41.398 --> 00:04:45.134\nthat people used\nto play out their darkest desires.\n\n00:04:45.158 --> 00:04:48.814\nFor more than 10 years,\npeople who were charged with my care\n\n00:04:48.838 --> 00:04:51.998\nabused me physically,\nverbally and sexually.\n\n00:04:52.718 --> 00:04:55.478\nDespite what they thought, I did feel.\n\n00:04:56.358 --> 00:04:58.094\nThe first time it happened,\n\n00:04:58.118 --> 00:05:00.774\nI was shocked and filled with disbelief.\n\n00:05:00.798 --> 00:05:02.318\nHow could they do this to me?\n\n00:05:03.078 --> 00:05:04.654\nI was confused.\n\n00:05:04.678 --> 00:05:06.798\nWhat had I done to deserve this?\n\n00:05:07.398 --> 00:05:11.454\nPart of me wanted to cry\nand another part wanted to fight.\n\n00:05:11.478 --> 00:05:15.214\nHurt, sadness and anger\nflooded through me.\n\n00:05:15.238 --> 00:05:17.014\nI felt worthless.\n\n00:05:17.038 --> 00:05:18.958\nThere was no one to comfort me.\n\n00:05:20.038 --> 00:05:23.294\nBut neither of my parents\nknew this was happening.\n\n00:05:23.318 --> 00:05:27.374\nI lived in terror, knowing\nit would happen again and again.\n\n00:05:27.398 --> 00:05:29.494\nI just never knew when.\n\n00:05:29.518 --> 00:05:32.278\nAll I knew was that I would\nnever be the same.\n\n00:05:33.318 --> 00:05:36.934\nI remember once listening\nto Whitney Houston singing,\n\n00:05:36.958 --> 00:05:41.814\n\"No matter what they take from me,\nthey can't take away my dignity.\"\n\n00:05:41.838 --> 00:05:44.758\nAnd I thought to myself,\n\"You want to bet?\"\n\n00:05:47.078 --> 00:05:50.814\nPerhaps my parents could have\nfound out and could have helped.\n\n00:05:50.838 --> 00:05:53.094\nBut the years of constant caretaking,\n\n00:05:53.118 --> 00:05:56.014\nhaving to wake up\nevery two hours to turn me,\n\n00:05:56.038 --> 00:05:59.414\ncombined with them essentially\ngrieving the loss of their son,\n\n00:05:59.438 --> 00:06:02.774\nhad taken a toll on my mother and father.\n\n00:06:02.798 --> 00:06:06.374\nFollowing yet another heated argument\nbetween my parents,\n\n00:06:06.398 --> 00:06:09.014\nin a moment of despair and desperation,\n\n00:06:09.038 --> 00:06:12.358\nmy mother turned to me\nand told me that I should die.\n\n00:06:14.118 --> 00:06:17.254\nI was shocked, but as I thought\nabout what she had said,\n\n00:06:17.278 --> 00:06:21.294\nI was filled with enormous compassion\nand love for my mother,\n\n00:06:21.318 --> 00:06:23.278\nyet I could do nothing about it.\n\n00:06:24.598 --> 00:06:26.974\nThere were many moments when I gave up,\n\n00:06:26.998 --> 00:06:29.374\nsinking into a dark abyss.\n\n00:06:29.398 --> 00:06:32.534\nI remember one particularly low moment.\n\n00:06:32.558 --> 00:06:34.814\nMy dad left me alone in the car\n\n00:06:34.838 --> 00:06:38.414\nwhile he quickly went\nto buy something from the store.\n\n00:06:38.438 --> 00:06:41.054\nA random stranger walked past,\n\n00:06:41.078 --> 00:06:43.918\nlooked at me and he smiled.\n\n00:06:44.838 --> 00:06:47.974\nI may never know why, but that simple act,\n\n00:06:47.998 --> 00:06:50.294\nthe fleeting moment of human connection,\n\n00:06:50.318 --> 00:06:52.694\ntransformed how I was feeling,\n\n00:06:52.718 --> 00:06:54.638\nmaking me want to keep going.\n\n00:06:55.718 --> 00:06:58.654\nMy existence was tortured by monotony,\n\n00:06:58.678 --> 00:07:01.694\na reality that was often too much to bear.\n\n00:07:01.718 --> 00:07:05.854\nAlone with my thoughts,\nI constructed intricate fantasies\n\n00:07:05.878 --> 00:07:09.254\nabout ants running across the floor.\n\n00:07:09.278 --> 00:07:14.374\nI taught myself to tell the time\nby noticing where the shadows were.\n\n00:07:14.398 --> 00:07:18.534\nAs I learned how the shadows moved\nas the hours of the day passed,\n\n00:07:18.558 --> 00:07:23.214\nI understood how long it would be\nbefore I was picked up and taken home.\n\n00:07:23.238 --> 00:07:26.494\nSeeing my father walk\nthrough the door to collect me\n\n00:07:26.518 --> 00:07:28.678\nwas the best moment of the day.\n\n00:07:29.558 --> 00:07:31.894\nMy mind became a tool that I could use\n\n00:07:31.918 --> 00:07:34.734\nto either close down\nto retreat from my reality\n\n00:07:34.758 --> 00:07:39.734\nor enlarge into a gigantic space\nthat I could fill with fantasies.\n\n00:07:39.758 --> 00:07:41.734\nI hoped that my reality would change\n\n00:07:41.758 --> 00:07:44.614\nand someone would see\nthat I had come back to life.\n\n00:07:44.638 --> 00:07:47.334\nBut I had been washed away\nlike a sand castle\n\n00:07:47.358 --> 00:07:49.494\nbuilt too close to the waves,\n\n00:07:49.518 --> 00:07:53.694\nand in my place was the person\npeople expected me to be.\n\n00:07:53.718 --> 00:07:57.494\nTo some I was Martin,\na vacant shell, the vegetable,\n\n00:07:57.518 --> 00:08:01.934\ndeserving of harsh words,\ndismissal and even abuse.\n\n00:08:01.958 --> 00:08:04.894\nTo others, I was the tragically\nbrain-damaged boy\n\n00:08:04.918 --> 00:08:07.134\nwho had grown to become a man.\n\n00:08:07.158 --> 00:08:10.334\nSomeone they were kind to and cared for.\n\n00:08:10.358 --> 00:08:12.854\nGood or bad, I was a blank canvas\n\n00:08:12.878 --> 00:08:16.198\nonto which different versions\nof myself were projected.\n\n00:08:17.118 --> 00:08:20.414\nIt took someone new\nto see me in a different way.\n\n00:08:20.438 --> 00:08:24.694\nAn aromatherapist began coming\nto the care home about once a week.\n\n00:08:24.718 --> 00:08:27.694\nWhether through intuition\nor her attention to details\n\n00:08:27.718 --> 00:08:29.734\nthat others failed to notice,\n\n00:08:29.758 --> 00:08:33.894\nshe became convinced that I could\nunderstand what was being said.\n\n00:08:33.918 --> 00:08:37.414\nShe urged my parents\nto have me tested by experts\n\n00:08:37.438 --> 00:08:40.734\nin augmentative\nand alternative communication.\n\n00:08:40.758 --> 00:08:41.974\nAnd within a year,\n\n00:08:41.998 --> 00:08:46.054\nI was beginning to use\na computer program to communicate.\n\n00:08:46.078 --> 00:08:49.814\nIt was exhilarating,\nbut frustrating at times.\n\n00:08:49.838 --> 00:08:51.814\nI had so many words in my mind,\n\n00:08:51.838 --> 00:08:54.654\nthat I couldn't wait\nto be able to share them.\n\n00:08:54.678 --> 00:08:59.414\nSometimes, I would say things to myself\nsimply because I could.\n\n00:08:59.438 --> 00:09:02.054\nIn myself, I had a ready audience,\n\n00:09:02.078 --> 00:09:05.214\nand I believed that by expressing\nmy thoughts and wishes,\n\n00:09:05.238 --> 00:09:06.974\nothers would listen, too.\n\n00:09:06.998 --> 00:09:09.254\nBut as I began to communicate more,\n\n00:09:09.278 --> 00:09:12.454\nI realized that it was in fact\nonly just the beginning\n\n00:09:12.478 --> 00:09:15.414\nof creating a new voice for myself.\n\n00:09:15.438 --> 00:09:19.774\nI was thrust into a world\nI didn't quite know how to function in.\n\n00:09:19.798 --> 00:09:21.454\nI stopped going to the care home\n\n00:09:21.478 --> 00:09:25.334\nand managed to get my first job\nmaking photocopies.\n\n00:09:25.358 --> 00:09:28.814\nAs simple as this may sound,\nit was amazing.\n\n00:09:28.838 --> 00:09:30.854\nMy new world was really exciting\n\n00:09:30.878 --> 00:09:33.694\nbut often quite overwhelming\nand frightening.\n\n00:09:33.718 --> 00:09:35.534\nI was like a man-child,\n\n00:09:35.558 --> 00:09:37.654\nand as liberating as it often was,\n\n00:09:37.678 --> 00:09:39.414\nI struggled.\n\n00:09:39.438 --> 00:09:42.974\nI also learned that many of those\nwho had known me for a long time\n\n00:09:42.998 --> 00:09:47.654\nfound it impossible to abandon the idea\nof Martin they had in their heads.\n\n00:09:47.678 --> 00:09:49.294\nWhile those I had only just met\n\n00:09:49.318 --> 00:09:53.078\nstruggled to look past the image\nof a silent man in a wheelchair.\n\n00:09:53.958 --> 00:09:56.694\nI realized that some people\nwould only listen to me\n\n00:09:56.718 --> 00:09:59.734\nif what I said was in line\nwith what they expected.\n\n00:09:59.758 --> 00:10:01.774\nOtherwise, it was disregarded\n\n00:10:01.798 --> 00:10:04.454\nand they did what they felt was best.\n\n00:10:04.478 --> 00:10:06.494\nI discovered that true communication\n\n00:10:06.518 --> 00:10:10.334\nis about more than merely\nphysically conveying a message.\n\n00:10:10.358 --> 00:10:13.318\nIt is about getting the message\nheard and respected.\n\n00:10:14.918 --> 00:10:17.174\nStill, things were going well.\n\n00:10:17.198 --> 00:10:19.774\nMy body was slowly getting stronger.\n\n00:10:19.798 --> 00:10:22.254\nI had a job in computing that I loved,\n\n00:10:22.278 --> 00:10:27.174\nand had even got Kojak, the dog\nI had been dreaming about for years.\n\n00:10:27.198 --> 00:10:31.134\nHowever, I longed to share\nmy life with someone.\n\n00:10:31.158 --> 00:10:35.574\nI remember staring out the window\nas my dad drove me home from work,\n\n00:10:35.598 --> 00:10:40.294\nthinking I have so much love inside of me\nand nobody to give it to.\n\n00:10:40.318 --> 00:10:44.774\nJust as I had resigned myself\nto being single for the rest of my life,\n\n00:10:44.798 --> 00:10:46.574\nI met Joan.\n\n00:10:46.598 --> 00:10:50.054\nNot only is she the best thing\nthat has ever happened to me,\n\n00:10:50.078 --> 00:10:54.974\nbut Joan helped me to challenge\nmy own misconceptions about myself.\n\n00:10:54.998 --> 00:10:59.614\nJoan said it was through my words\nthat she fell in love with me.\n\n00:10:59.638 --> 00:11:02.414\nHowever, after all I had been through,\n\n00:11:02.438 --> 00:11:04.174\nI still couldn't shake the belief\n\n00:11:04.198 --> 00:11:07.414\nthat nobody could truly see\nbeyond my disability\n\n00:11:07.438 --> 00:11:10.014\nand accept me for who I am.\n\n00:11:10.038 --> 00:11:14.214\nI also really struggled\nto comprehend that I was a man.\n\n00:11:14.238 --> 00:11:17.054\nThe first time someone\nreferred to me as a man,\n\n00:11:17.078 --> 00:11:19.374\nit stopped me in my tracks.\n\n00:11:19.398 --> 00:11:24.014\nI felt like looking around\nand asking, \"Who, me?\"\n\n00:11:24.038 --> 00:11:26.214\nThat all changed with Joan.\n\n00:11:26.238 --> 00:11:27.814\nWe have an amazing connection\n\n00:11:27.838 --> 00:11:32.494\nand I learned how important it is\nto communicate openly and honestly.\n\n00:11:32.518 --> 00:11:37.454\nI felt safe, and it gave me the confidence\nto truly say what I thought.\n\n00:11:37.478 --> 00:11:41.774\nI started to feel whole again,\na man worthy of love.\n\n00:11:41.798 --> 00:11:44.254\nI began to reshape my destiny.\n\n00:11:44.278 --> 00:11:46.494\nI spoke up a little more at work.\n\n00:11:46.518 --> 00:11:50.894\nI asserted my need for independence\nto the people around me.\n\n00:11:50.918 --> 00:11:54.774\nBeing given a means of communication\nchanged everything.\n\n00:11:54.798 --> 00:11:59.014\nI used the power of words and will\nto challenge the preconceptions\n\n00:11:59.038 --> 00:12:02.614\nof those around me\nand those I had of myself.\n\n00:12:02.638 --> 00:12:05.334\nCommunication is what makes us human,\n\n00:12:05.358 --> 00:12:07.654\nenabling us to connect\non the deepest level\n\n00:12:07.678 --> 00:12:09.614\nwith those around us --\n\n00:12:09.638 --> 00:12:11.214\ntelling our own stories,\n\n00:12:11.238 --> 00:12:14.854\nexpressing wants, needs and desires,\n\n00:12:14.878 --> 00:12:18.014\nor hearing those of others\nby really listening.\n\n00:12:18.038 --> 00:12:21.374\nAll this is how the world\nknows who we are.\n\n00:12:21.398 --> 00:12:23.198\nSo who are we without it?\n\n00:12:24.438 --> 00:12:27.614\nTrue communication increases understanding\n\n00:12:27.638 --> 00:12:30.678\nand creates a more caring\nand compassionate world.\n\n00:12:31.758 --> 00:12:34.854\nOnce, I was perceived\nto be an inanimate object,\n\n00:12:34.878 --> 00:12:38.174\na mindless phantom\nof a boy in a wheelchair.\n\n00:12:38.198 --> 00:12:40.454\nToday, I am so much more.\n\n00:12:40.478 --> 00:12:42.894\nA husband, a son, a friend,\n\n00:12:42.918 --> 00:12:47.174\na brother, a business owner,\na first-class honors graduate,\n\n00:12:47.198 --> 00:12:49.534\na keen amateur photographer.\n\n00:12:49.558 --> 00:12:53.398\nIt is my ability to communicate\nthat has given me all this.\n\n00:12:54.278 --> 00:12:57.974\nWe are told that actions\nspeak louder than words.\n\n00:12:57.998 --> 00:12:59.934\nBut I wonder,\n\n00:12:59.958 --> 00:13:01.158\ndo they?\n\n00:13:02.838 --> 00:13:05.494\nOur words, however we communicate them,\n\n00:13:05.518 --> 00:13:07.614\nare just as powerful.\n\n00:13:07.638 --> 00:13:10.374\nWhether we speak the words\nwith our own voices,\n\n00:13:10.398 --> 00:13:11.734\ntype them with our eyes,\n\n00:13:11.758 --> 00:13:16.014\nor communicate them non-verbally\nto someone who speaks them for us,\n\n00:13:16.038 --> 00:13:18.918\nwords are among our most

if you've ever been asked the question \"What do you want to be when you grow up?\"Now if you had to guess, how old would you say you were when you were first asked this question? You can just hold up fingers. Three. Five. Three. Five. Five. OK. Now, raise your hand if the question \"What do you want to be when you grow up?\" has ever caused you any anxiety.(Laughter)Any anxiety at all.I'm someone who's never been able to answer the question \"What do you want to be when you grow up?\"See, the problem wasn't that I didn't have any interests \u2014 it's that I had too many. In high school, I liked English and math and art and I built websites and I played guitar in a punk band called Frustrated Telephone Operator. Maybe you've heard of us.(Laughter)This continued after high school, and at a certain point, I began to notice this pattern in myself where I would become interested in an area and I would dive in, become all-consumed, and I'd get to be pretty good at whatever it was, and then I would hit this point where I'd start to get bored. And usually I would try and persist anyway, because I had already devoted so much time and energy and sometimes money into this field. But eventually this sense of boredom, this feeling of, like, yeah, I got this, this isn't challenging anymore \u2014 it would get to be too much. And I would have to let it go.But then I would become interested in something else, something totally unrelated, and I would dive into that, and become all-consumed, and I'd be like, \"Yes! I found my thing,\" and then I would hit this point again where I'd start to get bored. And eventually, I would let it go. But then I would discover something new and totally different, and I would dive into that.This pattern caused me a lot of anxiety, for two reasons. The first was that I wasn't sure how I was going to turn any of this into a career. I thought that I would eventually have to pick one thing, deny all of my other passions, and just resign myself to being bored. The other reason it caused me so much anxiety was a little bit more personal. I worried that there was something wrong with this, and something wrong with me for being unable to stick with anything. I worried that I was afraid of commitment, or that I was scattered, or that I was self-sabotaging, afraid of my own success.If you can relate to my story and to these feelings, I'd like you to ask yourself a question that I wish I had asked myself back then. Ask yourself where you learned to assign the meaning of wrong or abnormal to doing many things. I'll tell you where you learned it: you learned it from the culture.We are first asked the question \"What do you want to be when you grow up?\" when we're about five years old. And the truth is that no one really cares what you say when you're that age.(Laughter)It's considered an innocuous question, posed to little kids to elicit cute replies, like, \"I want to be an astronaut,\" or \"I want to be a ballerina,\" or \"I want to be a pirate.\" Insert Halloween costume here.(Laughter)But this question gets asked of us again and again as we get older in various forms \u2014 for instance, high school students might get asked what major they're going to pick in college. And at some point, \"What do you want to be when you grow up?\" goes from being the cute exercise it once was to the thing that keeps us up at night. Why?See, while this question inspires kids to dream about what they could be, it does not inspire them to dream about all that they could be. In fact, it does just the opposite, because when someone asks you what you want to be, you can't reply with 20 different things, though well-meaning adults will likely chuckle and be like, \"Oh, how cute, but you can't be a violin maker and a psychologist. You have to choose.\"This is Dr. Bob Childs \u2014(Laughter)and he's a luthier and psychotherapist. And this is Amy Ng, a magazine editor turned illustrator, entrepreneur, teacher and creative director. But most kids don't hear about people like this. All they hear is that they're going to have to choose. But it's more than that. The notion of the narrowly focused life is highly romanticized in our culture. It's this idea of destiny or the one true calling, the idea that we each have one great thing we are meant to do during our time on this earth, and you need to figure out what that thing is and devote your life to it.But what if you're someone who isn't wired this way? What if there are a lot of different subjects that you're curious about, and many different things you want to do? Well, there is no room for someone like you in this framework. And so you might feel alone. You might feel like you don't have a purpose. And you might feel like there's something wrong with you. There's nothing wrong with you. What you are is a multipotentialite.(Laughter)(Applause)A multipotentialite is someone with many interests and creative pursuits. It's a mouthful to say. It might help if you break it up into three parts: multi, potential, and ite. You can also use one of the other terms that connote the same idea, such as polymath, the Renaissance person. Actually, during the Renaissance period, it was considered the ideal to be well-versed in multiple disciplines. Barbara Sher refers to us as \"scanners.\" Use whichever term you like, or invent your own. I have to say I find it sort of fitting that as a community, we cannot agree on a single identity.(Laughter)It's easy to see your multipotentiality as a limitation or an affliction that you need to overcome. But what I've learned through speaking with people and writing about these ideas on my website, is that there are some tremendous strengths to being this way. Here are three multipotentialite super powers.One: idea synthesis. That is, combining two or more fields and creating something new at the intersection. Sha Hwang and Rachel Binx drew from their shared interests in cartography, data visualization, travel, mathematics and design, when they founded Meshu. Meshu is a company that creates custom geographically-inspired jewelry. Sha and Rachel came up with this unique idea not despite, but because of their eclectic mix of skills and experiences. Innovation happens at the intersections. That's where the new ideas come from. And multipotentialites, with all of their backgrounds, are able to access a lot of these points of intersection.The second multipotentialite superpower is rapid learning. When multipotentialites become interested in something, we go hard. We observe everything we can get our hands on. We're also used to being beginners, because we've been beginners so many times in the past, and this means that we're less afraid of trying new things and stepping out of our comfort zones. What's more, many skills are transferable across disciplines, and we bring everything we've learned to every new area we pursue, so we're rarely starting from scratch.Nora Dunn is a full-time traveler and freelance writer. As a child concert pianist, she honed an incredible ability to develop muscle memory. Now, she's the fastest typist she knows.(Laughter)Before becoming a writer, Nora was a financial planner. She had to learn the finer mechanics of sales when she was starting her practice, and this skill now helps her write compelling pitches to editors. It is rarely a waste of time to pursue something you're drawn to, even if you end up quitting. You might apply that knowledge in a different field entirely, in a way that you couldn't have anticipated.The third multipotentialite superpower is adaptability; that is, the ability to morph into whatever you need to be in a given situation. Abe Cajudo is sometimes a video director, sometimes a web designer, sometimes a Kickstarter consultant, sometimes a teacher, and sometimes, apparently, James Bond.(Laughter)He's valuable because he does good work. He's even more valuable because he can take on various roles, depending on his clients' needs. Fast Company magazine identified adaptability as the single most important skill to develop in order to thrive in the 21st century. The economic world is changing so quickly and unpredictably that it is the individuals and organizations that can pivot in order to meet the needs of the market that are really going to thrive.Idea synthesis, rapid learning and adaptability: three skills that multipotentialites are very adept at, and three skills that they might lose if pressured to narrow their focus. As a society, we have a vested interest in encouraging multipotentialites to be themselves. We have a lot of complex, multidimensional problems in the world right now, and we need creative, out-of-the-box thinkers to tackle them.Now, let's say that you are, in your heart, a specialist. You came out of the womb knowing you wanted to be a pediatric neurosurgeon. Don't worry \u2014 there's nothing wrong with you, either.(Laughter)In fact, some of the best teams are comprised of a specialist and multipotentialite paired together. The specialist can dive in deep and implement ideas, while the multipotentialite brings a breadth of knowledge to the project. It's a beautiful partnership. But we should all be designing lives and careers that are aligned with how we're wired. And sadly, multipotentialites are largely being encouraged simply to be more like their specialist peers.So with that said, if there is one thing you take away from this talk, I hope that it is this: embrace your inner wiring, whatever that may be. If you're a specialist at heart, then by all means, specialize. That is where you'll do your best work. But to the multipotentialites in the room, including those of you who may have just realized in the last 12 minutes that you are one \u2014(Laughter)to you I say: embrace your many passions. Follow your curiosity down those rabbit holes. Explore your intersections. Embracing our inner wiring leads to a happier, more authentic life. And perhaps more importantly \u2014 multipotentialites, the world needs us.Thank you.(Applause)", "id": 2341, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:12.529 --> 00:00:15.316\nRaise your hand if you've ever\nbeen asked the question\n\n00:00:15.340 --> 00:00:18.340\n\"What do you want to be when you grow up?\"\n\n00:00:18.695 --> 00:00:20.280\nNow if you had to guess,\n\n00:00:20.304 --> 00:00:23.721\nhow old would you say you were\nwhen you were first asked this question?\n\n00:00:23.745 --> 00:00:25.344\nYou can just hold up fingers.\n\n00:00:25.957 --> 00:00:30.590\nThree.

Here's how we adapt", "duration": "863", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/alice_bows_larkin_we_re_too_late_to_prevent_climate_change_here_s_how_we_adapt", "transcript": "Over our lifetimes, we've all contributed to climate change. Actions, choices and behaviors will have led to an increase in greenhouse gas emissions. And I think that that's quite a powerful thought. But it does have the potential to make us feel guilty when we think about decisions we might have made around where to travel to, how often and how, about the energy that we choose to use in our homes or in our workplaces, or quite simply the lifestyles that we lead and enjoy. But we can also turn that thought on its head, and think that if we've had such a profound but a negative impact on our climate already, then we have an opportunity to influence the amount of future climate change that we will need to adapt to.So we have a choice. We can either choose to start to take climate change seriously, and significantly cut and mitigate our greenhouse gas emissions, and then we will have to adapt to less of the climate change impacts in future. Alternatively, we can continue to really ignore the climate change problem. But if we do that, we are also choosing to adapt to very much more powerful climate impacts in future. And not only that. As people who live in countries with high per capita emissions, we're making that choice on behalf of others as well. But the choice that we don't have is a no climate change future.Over the last two decades, our government negotiators and policymakers have been coming together to discuss climate change, and they've been focused on avoiding a two-degree centigrade warming above pre-industrial levels. That's the temperature that's associated with dangerous impacts across a range of different indicators, to humans and to the environment. So two degrees centigrade constitutes dangerous climate change.But dangerous climate change can be subjective. So if we think about an extreme weather event that might happen in some part of the world, and if that happens in a part of the world where there is good infrastructure, where there are people that are well-insured and so on, then that impact can be disruptive. It can cause upset, it could cause cost. It could even cause some deaths. But if that exact same weather event happens in a part of the world where there is poor infrastructure, or where people are not well-insured, or they're not having good support networks, then that same climate change impact could be devastating. It could cause a significant loss of home, but it could also cause significant amounts of death.So this is a graph of the CO2 emissions at the left-hand side from fossil fuel and industry, and time from before the Industrial Revolution out towards the present day. And what's immediately striking about this is that emissions have been growing exponentially. If we focus in on a shorter period of time from 1950, we have established in 1988 the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the Rio Earth Summit in 1992, then rolling on a few years, in 2009 we had the Copenhagen Accord, where it established avoiding a two-degree temperature rise in keeping with the science and on the basis of equity. And then in 2012, we had the Rio+20 event. And all the way through, during all of these meetings and many others as well, emissions have continued to rise. And if we focus on our historical emission trend in recent years, and we put that together with our understanding of the direction of travel in our global economy, then we are much more on track for a four-degree centigrade global warming than we are for the two-degree centigrade.Now, let's just pause for a moment and think about this four-degree global average temperature. Most of our planet is actually made up of the sea. Now, because the sea has a greater thermal inertia than the land, the average temperatures over land are actually going to be higher than they are over the sea. The second thing is that we as human beings don't experience global average temperatures. We experience hot days, cold days, rainy days, especially if you live in Manchester like me.So now put yourself in a city center. Imagine somewhere in the world: Mumbai, Beijing, New York, London. It's the hottest day that you've ever experienced. There's sun beating down, there's concrete and glass all around you. Now imagine that same day \u2014 but it's six, eight, maybe 10 to 12 degrees warmer on that day during that heat wave. That's the kind of thing we're going to experience under a four-degree global average temperature scenario.And the problem with these extremes, and not just the temperature extremes, but also the extremes in terms of storms and other climate impacts, is our infrastructure is just not set up to deal with these sorts of events. So our roads and our rail networks have been designed to last for a long time and withstand only certain amounts of impacts in different parts of the world. And this is going to be extremely challenged. Our power stations are expected to be cooled by water to a certain temperature to remain effective and resilient. And our buildings are designed to be comfortable within a particular temperature range. And this is all going to be significantly challenged under a four-degree-type scenario. Our infrastructure has not been designed to cope with this.So if we go back, also thinking about four degrees, it's not just the direct impacts, but also some indirect impacts. So if we take food security, for example. Maize and wheat yields in some parts of the world are expected to be up to 40 percent lower under a four-degree scenario, rice up to 30 percent lower. This will be absolutely devastating for global food security. So all in all, the kinds of impacts anticipated under this four-degree centigrade scenario are going to be incompatible with global organized living.So back to our trajectories and our graphs of four degrees and two degrees. Is it reasonable still to focus on the two-degree path? There are quite a lot of my colleagues and other scientists who would say that it's now too late to avoid a two-degree warming. But I would just like to draw on my own research on energy systems, on food systems, aviation and also shipping, just to say that I think there is still a small fighting chance of avoiding this two-degree dangerous climate change. But we really need to get to grips with the numbers to work out how to do it.So if you focus in on this trajectory and these graphs, the yellow circle there highlights that the departure from the red four-degree pathway to the two-degree green pathway is immediate. And that's because of cumulative emissions, or the carbon budget. So in other words, because of the lights and the projectors that are on in this room right now, the CO2 that is going into our atmosphere as a result of that electricity consumption lasts a very long time. Some of it will be in our atmosphere for a century, maybe much longer. It will accumulate, and greenhouse gases tend to be cumulative. And that tells us something about these trajectories. First of all, it tells us that it's the area under these curves that matter, not where we reach at a particular date in future. And that's important, because it doesn't matter if we come up with some amazing whiz-bang technology to sort out our energy problem on the last day of 2049, just in the nick of time to sort things out. Because in the meantime, emissions will have accumulated. So if we continue on this red, four-degree centigrade scenario pathway, the longer we continue on it, that will need to be made up for in later years to keep the same carbon budget, to keep the same area under the curve, which means that that trajectory, the red one there, becomes steeper. So in other words, if we don't reduce emissions in the short to medium term, then we'll have to make more significant year-on-year emission reductions. We also know that we have to decarbonize our energy system. But if we don't start to cut emissions in the short to medium term, then we will have to do that even sooner. So this poses really big challenges for us.The other thing it does is tells us something about energy policy. If you live in a part of the world where per capita emissions are already high, it points us towards reducing energy demand. And that's because with all the will in the world, the large-scale engineering infrastructure that we need to roll out rapidly to decarbonize the supply side of our energy system is just simply not going to happen in time. So it doesn't matter whether we choose nuclear power or carbon capture and storage, upscale our biofuel production, or go for a much bigger roll-out of wind turbines and wave turbines. All of that will take time. So because it's the area under the curve that matters, we need to focus on energy efficiency, but also on energy conservation \u2014 in other words, using less energy. And if we do that, that also means that as we continue to roll out the supply-side technology, we will have less of a job to do if we've actually managed to reduce our energy consumption, because we will then need less infrastructure on the supply side.Another issue that we really need to grapple with is the issue of well-being and equity. There are many parts of the world where the standard of living needs to rise. Bbut with energy systems currently reliant on fossil fuel, as those economies grow so will emissions. And now, if we're all constrained by the same amount of carbon budget, that means that if some parts of the world's emissions are needing to rise, then other parts of the world's emissions need to reduce.So that poses very significant challenges for wealthy nations. Because according to our research, if you're in a country where per capita emissions are really high \u2014 so North America, Europe, Australia \u2014 emissions reductions of the order of 10 percent per year, and starting immediately, will be required for a good chance of avoiding the two-degree target. Let me just put that into context. The economist Nicholas Stern said that emission reductions of more than one percent per year had only ever been associated with economic recession or upheaval. So this poses huge challenges for the issue of economic growth, because if we have our high carbon infrastructure in place, it means that if our economies grow, then so do our emissions. So I'd just like to take a quote from a paper by myself and Kevin Anderson back in 2011 where we said that to avoid the two-degree framing of dangerous climate change, economic growth needs to be exchanged at least temporarily for a period of planned austerity in wealthy nations.This is a really difficult message to take, because what it suggests is that we really need to do things differently. This is not about just incremental change. This is about doing things differently, about whole system change, and sometimes it's about doing less things. And this applies to all of us, whatever sphere of influence we have. So it could be from writing to our local politician to talking to our boss at work or being the boss at work, or talking with our friends and family, or, quite simply, changing our lifestyles. Because we really need to make significant change. At the moment, we're choosing a four-degree scenario. If we really want to avoid the two-degree scenario, there really is no time like the present to act.Thank you.(Applause)Bruno Giussani: Alice, basically what you're saying, the talk is, unless wealthy nations start cutting 10 percent per year the emissions now, this year, not in 2020 or '25, we are going to go straight to the four-plus-degree scenario. I am wondering what's your take on the cut by 70 percent for 2070.Alice Bows-Larkin: Yeah, it's just nowhere near enough to avoid two degrees. One of the things that often \u2014 when there are these modeling studies that look at what we need to do, is they tend to hugely overestimate how quickly other countries in the world can start to reduce emissions. So they make kind of heroic assumptions about that. The more we do that, because it's the cumulative emissions, the short-term stuff that really matters. So it does make a huge difference. If a big country like China, for example, continues to grow even for just a few extra years, that will make a big difference to when we need to decarbonize. So I don't think we can even say when it will be, because it all depends on what we have to do in the short term. But I think we've just got huge scope, and we don't pull those levers that allow us to reduce the energy demand, which is a shame.BG: Alice, thank you for coming to TED and sharing this data.ABL:

--> 00:00:43.254\nabout the energy that we choose to use\n\n00:00:43.278 --> 00:00:45.878\nin our homes or in our workplaces,\n\n00:00:46.438 --> 00:00:50.318\nor quite simply the lifestyles\nthat we lead and enjoy.\n\n00:00:51.758 --> 00:00:55.094\nBut we can also turn\nthat thought on its head,\n\n00:00:55.118 --> 00:00:57.654\nand think that if we've had\nsuch a profound\n\n00:00:57.678 --> 00:01:00.518\nbut a negative impact\non our climate already,\n\n00:01:00.958 --> 00:01:06.254\nthen we have an opportunity to influence\nthe amount of future climate change\n\n00:01:06.278 --> 00:01:08.158\nthat we will need to adapt to.\n\n00:01:09.278 --> 00:01:10.734\nSo we have a choice.\n\n00:01:10.758 --> 00:01:15.174\nWe can either choose to start\nto take climate change seriously,\n\n00:01:15.198 --> 00:01:19.854\nand significantly cut and mitigate\nour greenhouse gas emissions,\n\n00:01:19.878 --> 00:01:24.198\nand then we will have to adapt to less\nof the climate change impacts in future.\n\n00:01:25.078 --> 00:01:29.918\nAlternatively, we can continue to really\nignore the climate change problem.\n\n00:01:30.678 --> 00:01:33.294\nBut if we do that, we are also choosing\n\n00:01:33.318 --> 00:01:37.838\nto adapt to very much more powerful\nclimate impacts in future.\n\n00:01:38.278 --> 00:01:39.494\nAnd not only that.\n\n00:01:39.518 --> 00:01:42.894\nAs people who live in countries\nwith high per capita emissions,\n\n00:01:42.918 --> 00:01:46.318\nwe're making that choice\non behalf of others as well.\n\n00:01:47.078 --> 00:01:49.054\nBut the choice that we don't have\n\n00:01:49.078 --> 00:01:51.398\nis a no climate change future.\n\n00:01:53.238 --> 00:01:55.214\nOver the last two decades,\n\n00:01:55.238 --> 00:01:59.094\nour government negotiators\nand policymakers have been coming together\n\n00:01:59.118 --> 00:02:01.038\nto discuss climate change,\n\n00:02:01.398 --> 00:02:05.814\nand they've been focused on\navoiding a two-degree centigrade warming\n\n00:02:05.838 --> 00:02:07.638\nabove pre-industrial levels.\n\n00:02:08.478 --> 00:02:12.054\nThat's the temperature that's associated\nwith dangerous impacts\n\n00:02:12.078 --> 00:02:14.678\nacross a range of different indicators,\n\n00:02:15.078 --> 00:02:17.694\nto humans and to the environment.\n\n00:02:17.718 --> 00:02:21.877\nSo two degrees centigrade\nconstitutes dangerous climate change.\n\n00:02:22.502 --> 00:02:24.694\nBut dangerous climate change\ncan be subjective.\n\n00:02:24.718 --> 00:02:27.014\nSo if we think about\nan extreme weather event\n\n00:02:27.038 --> 00:02:29.086\nthat might happen\nin some part of the world,\n\n00:02:29.398 --> 00:02:33.374\nand if that happens in a part of the world\nwhere there is good infrastructure,\n\n00:02:33.398 --> 00:02:36.158\nwhere there are people\nthat are well-insured and so on,\n\n00:02:36.478 --> 00:02:40.094\nthen that impact can be disruptive.\n\n00:02:40.118 --> 00:02:43.374\nIt can cause upset, it could cause cost.\n\n00:02:43.398 --> 00:02:45.118\nIt could even cause some deaths.\n\n00:02:45.558 --> 00:02:49.054\nBut if that exact same weather event\nhappens in a part of the world\n\n00:02:49.078 --> 00:02:51.094\nwhere there is poor infrastructure,\n\n00:02:51.118 --> 00:02:53.334\nor where people are not well-insured,\n\n00:02:53.358 --> 00:02:55.774\nor they're not having\ngood support networks,\n\n00:02:55.798 --> 00:02:59.838\nthen that same climate change impact\ncould be devastating.\n\n00:03:00.278 --> 00:03:03.814\nIt could cause a significant loss of home,\n\n00:03:03.838 --> 00:03:06.838\nbut it could also cause\nsignificant amounts of death.\n\n00:03:07.758 --> 00:03:11.734\nSo this is a graph of the CO2 emissions\nat the left-hand side\n\n00:03:11.758 --> 00:03:13.574\nfrom fossil fuel and industry,\n\n00:03:13.598 --> 00:03:16.574\nand time from before\nthe Industrial Revolution\n\n00:03:16.598 --> 00:03:18.198\nout towards the present day.\n\n00:03:18.798 --> 00:03:21.254\nAnd what's immediately striking about this\n\n00:03:21.278 --> 00:03:24.318\nis that emissions\nhave been growing exponentially.\n\n00:03:25.118 --> 00:03:29.334\nIf we focus in on a shorter\nperiod of time from 1950,\n\n00:03:29.358 --> 00:03:32.454\nwe have established in 1988\n\n00:03:32.478 --> 00:03:35.118\nthe Intergovernmental Panel\non Climate Change,\n\n00:03:35.878 --> 00:03:39.254\nthe Rio Earth Summit in 1992,\n\n00:03:39.278 --> 00:03:43.318\nthen rolling on a few years,\nin 2009 we had the Copenhagen Accord,\n\n00:03:43.958 --> 00:03:48.414\nwhere it established avoiding\na two-degree temperature rise\n\n00:03:48.438 --> 00:03:51.918\nin keeping with the science\nand on the basis of equity.\n\n00:03:52.638 --> 00:03:56.574\nAnd then in 2012, we had the Rio+20 event.\n\n00:03:56.598 --> 00:03:59.414\nAnd all the way through,\nduring all of these meetings\n\n00:03:59.438 --> 00:04:00.998\nand many others as well,\n\n00:04:01.398 --> 00:04:03.598\nemissions have continued to rise.\n\n00:04:04.878 --> 00:04:10.094\nAnd if we focus on our historical\nemission trend in recent years,\n\n00:04:10.118 --> 00:04:12.334\nand we put that together\nwith our understanding\n\n00:04:12.358 --> 00:04:14.838\nof the direction of travel\nin our global economy,\n\n00:04:15.238 --> 00:04:16.974\nthen we are much more on track\n\n00:04:16.998 --> 00:04:19.998\nfor a four-degree centigrade\nglobal warming\n\n00:04:20.398 --> 00:04:23.638\nthan we are for the two-degree centigrade.\n\n00:04:24.358 --> 00:04:26.094\nNow, let's just pause for a moment\n\n00:04:26.118 --> 00:04:29.917\nand think about this four-degree\nglobal average temperature.\n\n00:04:30.558 --> 00:04:33.718\nMost of our planet\nis actually made up of the sea.\n\n00:04:34.518 --> 00:04:37.838\nNow, because the sea has a greater\nthermal inertia than the land,\n\n00:04:38.518 --> 00:04:41.614\nthe average temperatures over land\nare actually going to be higher\n\n00:04:41.638 --> 00:04:43.158\nthan they are over the sea.\n\n00:04:43.598 --> 00:04:47.214\nThe second thing is that we\nas human beings don't experience\n\n00:04:47.238 --> 00:04:48.798\nglobal average temperatures.\n\n00:04:49.158 --> 00:04:51.974\nWe experience hot days, cold days,\n\n00:04:51.998 --> 00:04:54.918\nrainy days, especially if you live\nin Manchester like me.\n\n00:04:55.758 --> 00:04:58.414\nSo now put yourself in a city center.\n\n00:04:58.438 --> 00:05:00.014\nImagine somewhere in the world:\n\n00:05:00.038 --> 00:05:03.414\nMumbai, Beijing, New York, London.\n\n00:05:03.438 --> 00:05:06.638\nIt's the hottest day\nthat you've ever experienced.\n\n00:05:06.998 --> 00:05:08.454\nThere's sun beating down,\n\n00:05:08.478 --> 00:05:10.838\nthere's concrete and glass all around you.\n\n00:05:11.598 --> 00:05:13.774\nNow imagine that same day --\n\n00:05:13.798 --> 00:05:18.398\nbut it's six, eight,\nmaybe 10 to 12 degrees warmer\n\n00:05:18.718 --> 00:05:20.478\non that day during that heat wave.\n\n00:05:20.878 --> 00:05:23.212\nThat's the kind of thing\nwe're going to experience\n\n00:05:23.236 --> 00:05:27.276\nunder a four-degree global\naverage temperature scenario.\n\n00:05:27.918 --> 00:05:29.694\nAnd the problem with these extremes,\n\n00:05:29.718 --> 00:05:31.534\nand not just the temperature extremes,\n\n00:05:31.558 --> 00:05:35.614\nbut also the extremes in terms of storms\nand other climate impacts,\n\n00:05:35.638 --> 00:05:40.118\nis our infrastructure is just not set up\nto deal with these sorts of events.\n\n00:05:40.478 --> 00:05:42.374\nSo our roads and our rail networks\n\n00:05:42.398 --> 00:05:44.574\nhave been designed to last for a long time\n\n00:05:44.598 --> 00:05:47.254\nand withstand only\ncertain amounts of impacts\n\n00:05:47.278 --> 00:05:48.894\nin different parts of the world.\n\n00:05:48.918 --> 00:05:51.174\nAnd this is going to be\nextremely challenged.\n\n00:05:51.198 --> 00:05:54.734\nOur power stations\nare expected to be cooled by water\n\n00:05:54.758 --> 00:05:58.518\nto a certain temperature\nto remain effective and resilient.\n\n00:05:58.838 --> 00:06:01.094\nAnd our buildings\nare designed to be comfortable\n\n00:06:01.118 --> 00:06:03.334\nwithin a particular temperature range.\n\n00:06:03.358 --> 00:06:06.494\nAnd this is all going to be\nsignificantly challenged\n\n00:06:06.518 --> 00:06:08.774\nunder a four-degree-type scenario.\n\n00:06:08.798 --> 00:06:12.598\nOur infrastructure has not been\ndesigned to cope with this.\n\n00:06:14.398 --> 00:06:18.254\nSo if we go back, also thinking\nabout four degrees,\n\n00:06:18.278 --> 00:06:20.254\nit's not just the direct impacts,\n\n00:06:20.278 --> 00:06:22.278\nbut also some indirect impacts.\n\n00:06:22.598 --> 00:06:25.478\nSo if we take food security, for example.\n\n00:06:25.878 --> 00:06:27.718\nMaize and wheat yields\n\n00:06:28.118 --> 00:06:29.774\nin some parts of the world\n\n00:06:29.798 --> 00:06:32.758\nare expected to be up to 40 percent lower\n\n00:06:33.158 --> 00:06:35.174\nunder a four-degree scenario,\n\n00:06:35.198 --> 00:06:37.798\nrice up to 30 percent lower.\n\n00:06:38.118 --> 00:06:41.638\nThis will be absolutely devastating\nfor global food security.\n\n00:06:42.638 --> 00:06:45.574\nSo all in all, the kinds\nof impacts anticipated\n\n00:06:45.598 --> 00:06:48.358\nunder this four-degree centigrade scenario\n\n00:06:48.958 --> 00:06:53.638\nare going to be incompatible\nwith global organized living.\n\n00:06:55.798 --> 00:06:59.758\nSo back to our trajectories and our graphs\nof four degrees and two degrees.\n\n00:07:00.918 --> 00:07:04.358\nIs it reasonable still\nto focus on the two-degree path?\n\n00:07:04.878 --> 00:07:07.694\nThere are quite a lot of my colleagues\nand other scientists\n\n00:07:07.718 --> 00:07:11.038\nwho would say that it's now too late\nto avoid a two-degree warming.\n\n00:07:11.815 --> 00:07:14.054\nBut I would just like\nto draw on my own research\n\n00:07:14.078 --> 00:07:17.134\non energy systems, on food systems,\n\n00:07:17.158 --> 00:07:18.998\naviation and also shipping,\n\n00:07:19.558 --> 00:07:23.614\njust to say that I think there is still\na small fighting chance\n\n00:07:23.638 --> 00:07:27.254\nof avoiding this two-degree\ndangerous climate change.\n\n00:07:27.278 --> 00:07:29.659\nBut we really need\nto get to grips with the numbers\n\n00:07:29.683 --> 00:07:30.883\nto work out how to do it.\n\n00:07:31.798 --> 00:07:34.598\nSo if you focus in on this trajectory\nand these graphs,\n\n00:07:35.038 --> 00:07:38.014\nthe yellow circle there\nhighlights that the departure\n\n00:07:38.038 --> 00:07:40.534\nfrom the red four-degree pathway\n\n00:07:40.558 --> 00:07:44.598\nto the two-degree\ngreen pathway is immediate.\n\n00:07:44.998 --> 00:07:47.974\nAnd that's because\nof cumulative emissions,\n\n00:07:47.998 --> 00:07:49.574\nor the carbon budget.\n\n00:07:49.598 --> 00:07:53.254\nSo in other words, because\nof the lights and the projectors\n\n00:07:53.278 --> 00:07:54.974\nthat are on in this room right now,\n\n00:07:54.998 --> 00:07:56.951\nthe CO2 that is going into our atmosphere\n\n00:07:56.975 --> 00:07:59.295\nas a result of that\nelectricity consumption\n\n00:07:59.638 --> 00:08:01.134\nlasts a very long time.\n\n00:08:01.158 --> 00:08:05.174\nSome of it will be in our atmosphere\nfor a century, maybe much longer.\n\n00:08:05.198 --> 00:08:08.918\nIt will accumulate, and greenhouse gases\ntend to be cumulative.\n\n00:08:09.718 --> 00:08:12.534\nAnd that tells us something\nabout these trajectories.\n\n00:08:12.558 --> 00:08:16.574\nFirst of all, it tells us that it's\nthe area under these curves that matter,\n\n00:08:16.598 --> 00:08:19.574\nnot where we reach\nat a particular date in future.\n\n00:08:19.598 --> 00:08:21.789\nAnd that's important,\nbecause it doesn't matter\n\n00:08:21.813 --> 00:08:24.614\nif we come up with some amazing\nwhiz-bang technology\n\n00:08:24.638 --> 00:08:28.494\nto sort out our energy problem\non the last day of 2049,\n\n00:08:28.518 --> 00:08:30.814\njust in the nick of time\nto sort things out.\n\n00:08:30.838 --> 00:08:33.958\nBecause in the meantime,\nemissions will have accumulated.\n\n00:08:34.678 --> 00:08:39.758\nSo if we continue on this red,\nfour-degree centigrade scenario pathway,\n\n00:08:40.278 --> 00:08:42.174\nthe longer we continue on it,\n\n00:08:42.198 --> 00:08:45.574\nthat will need to be\nmade up for in later years\n\n00:08:45.598 --> 00:08:49.438\nto keep the same carbon budget,\nto keep the same area under the curve,\n\n00:08:49.918 --> 00:08:54.014\nwhich means that that trajectory,\nthe red one there, becomes steeper.\n\n00:08:54.038 --> 00:08:57.774\nSo in other words, if we don't reduce\nemissions in the short to medium term,\n\n00:08:57.798 --> 00:09:01.518\nthen we'll have to make more significant\nyear-on-year emission reductions.\n\n00:09:02.558 --> 00:09:05.718\nWe also know that we have\nto decarbonize our energy system.\n\n00:09:06.158 --> 00:09:10.054\nBut if we don't start to cut\nemissions in the short to medium term,\n\n00:09:10.078 --> 00:09:12.438\nthen we will have to do that even sooner.\n\n00:09:13.038 --> 00:09:15.918\nSo this poses really big\nchallenges for us.\n\n00:09:18.038 --> 00:09:21.158\nThe other thing it does is tells us\nsomething about energy policy.\n\n00:09:21.718 --> 00:09:25.654\nIf you live in a part of the world where\nper capita emissions are already high,\n\n00:09:25.678 --> 00:09:29.118\nit points us towards\nreducing energy demand.\n\n00:09:29.758 --> 00:09:32.094\nAnd that's because\nwith all the will in the world,\n\n00:09:32.118 --> 00:09:34.654\nthe large-scale engineering infrastructure\n\n00:09:34.678 --> 00:09:36.814\nthat we need to roll out rapidly\n\n00:09:36.838 --> 00:09:39.934\nto decarbonize the supply side\nof our energy system\n\n00:09:39.958 --> 00:09:42.198\nis just simply not going\nto happen in time.\n\n00:09:42.638 --> 00:09:45.094\nSo it doesn't matter\nwhether we choose nuclear power\n\n00:09:45.118 --> 00:09:46.974\nor carbon capture and storage,\n\n00:09:46.998 --> 00:09:49.334\nupscale our biofuel production,\n\n00:09:49.358 --> 00:09:53.574\nor go for a much bigger roll-out\nof wind turbines and wave turbines.\n\n00:09:53.598 --> 00:09:55.238\nAll of that will take time.\n\n00:09:55.678 --> 00:09:58.214\nSo because it's the area\nunder the curve that matters,\n\n00:09:58.238 --> 00:10:00.174\nwe need to focus on energy efficiency,\n\n00:10:00.198 --> 00:10:04.718\nbut also on energy conservation --\nin other words, using less energy.\n\n00:10:05.158 --> 00:10:07.374\nAnd if we do that, that also means\n\n00:10:07.398 --> 00:10:11.038\nthat as we continue to roll out\nthe supply-side technology,\n\n00:10:11.339 --> 00:10:14.054\nwe will have less of a job to do\nif we've actually managed\n\n00:10:14.078 --> 00:10:16.374\nto reduce our energy consumption,\n\n00:10:16.398 --> 00:10:20.878\nbecause we will then need\nless infrastructure on the supply side.\n\n00:10:21.678 --> 00:10:24.254\nAnother issue that we really\nneed to grapple with\n\n00:10:24.278 --> 00:10:27.478\nis the issue of well-being and equity.\n\n00:10:27.918 --> 00:10:32.678\nThere are many parts of the world where\nthe standard of living needs to rise.\n\n00:10:33.398 --> 00:10:38.134\nBbut with energy systems\ncurrently reliant on fossil fuel,\n\n00:10:38.158 --> 00:10:40.718\nas those economies grow\nso will emissions.\n\n00:10:41.278 --> 00:10:44.854\nAnd now, if we're all constrained\nby the same amount of carbon budget,\n\n00:10:44.878 --> 00:10:48.414\nthat means that if some parts of\nthe world's emissions are needing to rise,\n\n00:10:48.438 --> 00:10:52.118\nthen other parts of the world's\nemissions need to reduce.\n\n00:10:52.958 --> 00:10:57.118\nSo that poses very significant challenges\nfor wealthy nations.\n\n00:10:57.878 --> 00:11:00.318\nBecause according to our research,\n\n00:11:00.663 --> 00:11:03.854\nif you're in a country where per capita\nemissions are really high --\n\n00:11:03.878 --> 00:11:07.318\nso North America, Europe, Australia --\n\n00:11:07.838 --> 00:11:11.094\nemissions reductions of the order\nof 10 percent per year,\n\n00:11:11.118 --> 00:11:15.174\nand starting immediately,\nwill be required for a good chance\n\n00:11:15.198 --> 00:11:17.278\nof avoiding the two-degree target.\n\n00:11:18.078 --> 00:11:19.854\nLet me just put that into context.\n\n00:11:19.878 --> 00:11:21.694\nThe economist Nicholas Stern\n\n00:11:21.718 --> 00:11:24.934\nsaid that emission reductions\nof more than one percent per year\n\n00:11:24.958 --> 00:11:29.478\nhad only ever been associated\nwith economic recession or upheaval.\n\n00:11:30.958 --> 00:11:35.798\nSo this poses huge challenges\nfor the issue of economic growth,\n\n00:11:37.318 --> 00:11:40.918\nbecause if we have our\nhigh carbon infrastructure in place,\n\n00:11:41.238 --> 00:11:43.638\nit means that if our economies grow,\n\n00:11:43.998 --> 00:11:45.678\nthen so do our emissions.\n\n00:11:46.198 --> 00:11:48.294\nSo I'd just like to take\na quote from a paper\n\n00:11:48.318 --> 00:11:51.718\nby myself and Kevin Anderson back in 2011\n\n00:11:52.198 --> 00:11:57.438\nwhere we said that to avoid the two-degree\nframing of dangerous climate change,\n\n00:11:57.958 --> 00:12:02.174\neconomic growth needs to be exchanged\nat least temporarily\n\n00:12:02.198 --> 00:12:06.598\nfor a period of planned austerity\nin wealthy nations.\n\n00:12:08.318 --> 00:12:11.358\nThis is a really difficult\nmessage to take,\n\n00:12:12.158 --> 00:12:16.918\nbecause what it suggests is that\nwe really need to do things differently.\n\n00:12:17.398 --> 00:12:21.398\nThis is not about just incremental change.\n\n00:12:21.918 --> 00:12:26.214\nThis is about doing things differently,\nabout whole system change,\n\n00:12:26.238 --> 00:12:29.934\nand sometimes\nit's about doing less things.\n\n00:12:29.958 --> 00:12:32.374\nAnd this applies to all of us,\n\n00:12:32.398 --> 00:12:34.558\nwhatever sphere of influence we have.\n\n00:12:34.998 --> 00:12:38.094\nSo it could be from writing\nto our local politician\n\n00:12:38.118 --> 00:12:41.318\nto talking to our boss at work\nor being the boss at work,\n\n00:12:41.638 --> 00:12:46.118\nor talking with our friends and family,\nor, quite simply, changing our lifestyles.\n\n00:12:47.238 --> 00:12:50.398\nBecause we really need\nto make significant change.\n\n00:12:50.878 --> 00:12:55.094\nAt the moment, we're choosing\na four-degree scenario.\n\n00:12:55.118 --> 00:12:58.454\nIf we really want to avoid\nthe two-degree scenario,\n\n00:12:58.478 --> 00:13:02.054\nthere really is no time\nlike the present to act.\n\n00:13:02.078 --> 00:13:03.294\nThank you.\n\n00:13:03.318 --> 00:13:10.078\n(Applause)\n\n00:13:12.785 --> 00:13:15.214\nBruno Giussani: Alice,\nbasically what you're saying,\n\n00:13:15.238 --> 00:13:18.694\nthe talk is, unless wealthy nations\nstart cutting 10 percent per year\n\n00:13:18.718 --> 00:13:23.574\nthe emissions now, this year,\nnot in 2020 or '25,\n\n00:13:23.598 --> 00:13:27.558\nwe are going to go straight\nto the four-plus-degree scenario.\n\n00:13:28.118 --> 00:13:31.854\nI am wondering what's your take\non the cut by 70 percent for 2070.\n\n00:13:31.878 --> 00:13:35.454\nAlice Bows-Larkin: Yeah, it's just\nnowhere near enough to avoid two degrees.\n\n00:13:35.478 --> 00:13:36.962\nOne of the things that often --\n\n00:13:36.986 --> 00:13:40.534\nwhen there are these modeling studies\nthat look at what we need to do,\n\n00:13:40.558 --> 00:13:45.054\nis they tend to hugely overestimate\nhow quickly other countries in the world\n\n00:13:45.078 --> 00:13:46.654\ncan start to reduce emissions.\n\n00:13:46.678 --> 00:13:50.014\nSo they make kind of\nheroic assumptions about that.\n\n00:13:50.038 --> 00:13:52.800\nThe more we do that,\nbecause it's the cumulative emissions,\n\n00:13:52.824 --> 00:13:54.782\nthe short-term stuff that really matters.\n\n00:13:54.790 --> 00:13:56.425\nSo it does make a huge difference.\n\n00:13:56.449 --> 00:13:58.414\nIf a big country like China, for example,\n\n00:13:58.438 --> 00:14:00.854\ncontinues to grow\neven for just a few extra years,\n\n00:14:00.878 --> 00:14:03.894\nthat will make a big difference\nto when we need to decarbonize.\n\n00:14:03.918 --> 00:14:06.414\nSo I don't think we can even say\nwhen it will be,\n\n00:14:06.438 --> 00:14:09.398\nbecause it all depends\non what we have to do in the short term.\n\n00:14:09.422 --> 00:14:12.694\nBut I think we've just got huge scope,\nand we don't pull those levers\n\n00:14:12.718 --> 00:14:15.638\nthat allow us to reduce\nthe energy demand, which is a shame.\n\n00:14:15.956 --> 00:14:18.814\nBG: Alice, thank you for coming\nto TED and sharing this data.\n\n00:14:18.838 --> 00:14:20.038\nABL: Thank you.\n\n00:14:20.078 -->

But before I do that, I want to talk a little bit about the past. Now, throughout much of the recent history of medicine, we've thought about illness and treatment in terms of a profoundly simple model. In fact, the model is so simple that you could summarize it in six words: have disease, take pill, kill something.Now, the reason for the dominance of this model is of course the antibiotic revolution. Many of you might not know this, but we happen to be celebrating the hundredth year of the introduction of antibiotics into the United States. But what you do know is that that introduction was nothing short of transformative. Here you had a chemical, either from the natural world or artificially synthesized in the laboratory, and it would course through your body, it would find its target, lock into its target \u2014 a microbe or some part of a microbe \u2014 and then turn off a lock and a key with exquisite deftness, exquisite specificity. And you would end up taking a previously fatal, lethal disease \u2014 a pneumonia, syphilis, tuberculosis \u2014 and transforming that into a curable, or treatable illness. You have a pneumonia, you take penicillin, you kill the microbe and you cure the disease.So seductive was this idea, so potent the metaphor of lock and key and killing something, that it really swept through biology. It was a transformation like no other. And we've really spent the last 100 years trying to replicate that model over and over again in noninfectious diseases, in chronic diseases like diabetes and hypertension and heart disease. And it's worked, but it's only worked partly. Let me show you. You know, if you take the entire universe of all chemical reactions in the human body, every chemical reaction that your body is capable of, most people think that that number is on the order of a million. Let's call it a million. And now you ask the question, what number or fraction of reactions can actually be targeted by the entire pharmacopoeia, all of medicinal chemistry? That number is 250. The rest is chemical darkness. In other words, 0.025 percent of all chemical reactions in your body are actually targetable by this lock and key mechanism. You know, if you think about human physiology as a vast global telephone network with interacting nodes and interacting pieces, then all of our medicinal chemistry is operating on one tiny corner at the edge, the outer edge, of that network. It's like all of our pharmaceutical chemistry is a pole operator in Wichita, Kansas who is tinkering with about 10 or 15 telephone lines.So what do we do about this idea? What if we reorganized this approach? In fact, it turns out that the natural world gives us a sense of how one might think about illness in a radically different way, rather than disease, medicine, target. In fact, the natural world is organized hierarchically upwards, not downwards, but upwards, and we begin with a self-regulating, semi-autonomous unit called a cell. These self-regulating, semi-autonomous units give rise to self-regulating, semi-autonomous units called organs, and these organs coalesce to form things called humans, and these organisms ultimately live in environments, which are partly self-regulating and partly semi-autonomous.What's nice about this scheme, this hierarchical scheme building upwards rather than downwards, is that it allows us to think about illness as well in a somewhat different way. Take a disease like cancer. Since the 1950s, we've tried rather desperately to apply this lock and key model to cancer. We've tried to kill cells using a variety of chemotherapies  or targeted therapies, and as most of us know, that's worked. It's worked for diseases like leukemia. It's worked for some forms of breast cancer, but eventually you run to the ceiling of that approach. And it's only in the last 10 years or so that we've begun to think about using the immune system, remembering that in fact the cancer cell doesn't grow in a vacuum. It actually grows in a human organism. And could you use the organismal capacity, the fact that human beings have an immune system, to attack cancer? In fact, it's led to the some of the most spectacular new medicines in cancer.And finally there's the level of the environment, isn't there? You know, we don't think of cancer as altering the environment. But let me give you an example of a profoundly carcinogenic environment. It's called a prison. You take loneliness, you take depression, you take confinement, and you add to that, rolled up in a little white sheet of paper, one of the most potent neurostimulants that we know, called nicotine, and you add to that one of the most potent addictive substances that you know, and you have a pro-carcinogenic environment. But you can have anti-carcinogenic environments too. There are attempts to create milieus, change the hormonal milieu for breast cancer, for instance. We're trying to change the metabolic milieu for other forms of cancer.Or take another disease, like depression. Again, working upwards, since the 1960s and 1970s, we've tried, again, desperately to turn off molecules that operate between nerve cells \u2014 serotonin, dopamine \u2014 and tried to cure depression that way, and that's worked, but then that reached the limit. And we now know that what you really probably need to do is to change the physiology of the organ, the brain, rewire it, remodel it, and that, of course, we know study upon study has shown that talk therapy does exactly that, and study upon study has shown that talk therapy combined with medicines, pills, really is much more effective than either one alone. Can we imagine a more immersive environment that will change depression? Can you lock out the signals that elicit depression? Again, moving upwards along this hierarchical chain of organization. What's really at stake perhaps here is not the medicine itself but a metaphor. Rather than killing something, in the case of the great chronic degenerative diseases \u2014 kidney failure, diabetes, hypertension, osteoarthritis \u2014 maybe what we really need to do is change the metaphor to growing something. And that's the key, perhaps, to reframing our thinking about medicine.Now, this idea of changing, of creating a perceptual shift, as it were, came home to me to roost in a very personal manner about 10 years ago. About 10 years ago \u2014 I've been a runner most of my life \u2014 I went for a run, a Saturday morning run, I came back and woke up and I basically couldn't move. My right knee was swollen up, and you could hear that ominous crunch of bone against bone. And one of the perks of being a physician is that you get to order your own MRIs. And I had an MRI the next week, and it looked like that. Essentially, the meniscus of cartilage that is between bone had been completely torn and the bone itself had been shattered.Now, if you're looking at me and feeling sorry, let me tell you a few facts. If I was to take an MRI of every person in this audience, 60 percent of you would show signs of bone degeneration and cartilage degeneration like this. 85 percent of all women by the age of 70 would show moderate to severe cartilage degeneration. 50 to 60 percent of the men in this audience would also have such signs. So this is a very common disease. Well, the second perk of being a physician is that you can get to experiment on your own ailments. So about 10 years ago we began, we brought this process into the laboratory, and we began to do simple experiments, mechanically trying to fix this degeneration. We tried to inject chemicals into the knee spaces of animals to try to reverse cartilage degeneration, and to put a short summary on a very long and painful process, essentially it came to naught. Nothing happened. And then about seven years ago, we had a research student from Australia. The nice thing about Australians is that they're habitually used to looking at the world upside down.(Laughter)And so Dan suggested to me, \"You know, maybe it isn't a mechanical problem. Maybe it isn't a chemical problem. Maybe it's a stem cell problem.\" In other words, he had two hypotheses. Number one, there is such a thing as a skeletal stem cell \u2014 a skeletal stem cell that builds up the entire vertebrate skeleton, bone, cartilage and the fibrous elements of skeleton, just like there's a stem cell in blood, just like there's a stem cell in the nervous system. And two, that maybe that, the degeneration or dysfunction of this stem cell is what's causing osteochondral arthritis, a very common ailment. So really the question was, were we looking for a pill when we should have really been looking for a cell. So we switched our models, and now we began to look for skeletal stem cells. And to cut again a long story short, about five years ago, we found these cells. They live inside the skeleton. Here's a schematic and then a real photograph of one of them. The white stuff is bone, and these red columns that you see and the yellow cells are cells that have arisen from one single skeletal stem cell \u2014 columns of cartilage, columns of bone coming out of a single cell. These cells are fascinating. They have four properties. Number one is that they live where they're expected to live. They live just underneath the surface of the bone, underneath cartilage. You know, in biology, it's location, location, location. And they move into the appropriate areas and form bone and cartilage. That's one. Here's an interesting property. You can take them out of the vertebrate skeleton, you can culture them in petri dishes in the laboratory, and they are dying to form cartilage. Remember how we couldn't form cartilage for love or money? These cells are dying to form cartilage. They form their own furls of cartilage around themselves. They're also, number three, the most efficient repairers of fractures that we've ever encountered. This is a little bone, a mouse bone that we fractured and then let it heal by itself. These stem cells have come in and repaired, in yellow, the bone, in white, the cartilage, almost completely. So much so that if you label them with a fluorescent dye you can see them like some kind of peculiar cellular glue coming into the area of a fracture, fixing it locally and then stopping their work. Now, the fourth one is the most ominous, and that is that their numbers decline precipitously, precipitously, tenfold, fiftyfold, as you age.And so what had happened, really, is that we found ourselves in a perceptual shift. We had gone hunting for pills but we ended up finding theories. And in some ways we had hooked ourselves back onto this idea: cells, organisms, environments, because we were now thinking about bone stem cells, we were thinking about arthritis in terms of a cellular disease.And then the next question was, are there organs? Can you build this as an organ outside the body? Can you implant cartilage into areas of trauma? And perhaps most interestingly, can you ascend right up and create environments? You know, we know that exercise remodels bone, but come on, none of us is going to exercise. So could you imagine ways of passively loading and unloading bone so that you can recreate or regenerate degenerating cartilage?And perhaps more interesting, and more importantly, the question is, can you apply this model more globally outside medicine? What's at stake, as I said before, is not killing something, but growing something. And it raises a series of, I think, some of the most interesting questions about how we think about medicine in the future. Could your medicine be a cell and not a pill? How would we grow these cells? What we would we do to stop the malignant growth of these cells? We heard about the problems of unleashing growth. Could we implant suicide genes into these cells to stop them from growing? Could your medicine be an organ that's created outside the body and then implanted into the body? Could that stop some of the degeneration? What if the organ needed to have memory? In cases of diseases of the nervous system some of those organs had memory. How could we implant those memories back in? Could we store these organs? Would each organ have to be developed for an individual human being and put back? And perhaps most puzzlingly, could your medicine be an environment? Could you patent an environment? You know, in every culture, shamans have been using environments as medicines. Could we imagine that for our future? I've talked a lot about models. I began this talk with models. So let me end with some thoughts about model building. That's what we do as scientists. You know, when an architect builds a model, he or she is trying to show you a world in miniature. But when a scientist is building a model, he or she is trying to show you the world in metaphor. He or she is trying to create a new way of seeing. The former is a scale shift. The latter is a perceptual shift.Now, antibiotics created such a perceptual shift in our way of thinking about medicine that it really colored, distorted, very successfully, the way we've thought about medicine for the last hundred years. But we need new models to think about medicine in the future. That's what's at stake.You know, there's a popular trope out there that the reason we haven't had the transformative impact on the treatment of illness is because we don't have powerful-enough drugs, and that's partly true. But perhaps the real reason is that we don't have powerful-enough ways of thinking about medicines. It's certainly true that it would be lovely to have new medicines. But perhaps what's really at stake are three more intangible M's: mechanisms, models, metaphors.Thank you.(Applause)Chris Anderson: I really like this metaphor. How does it link in? There's a lot of talk in technologyland about the personalization of medicine, that we have all this data and that medical treatments of the future will be for you specifically, your genome, your current context. Does that apply to this model you've got here?Siddhartha Mukherjee: It's a very interesting question. We've thought about personalization of medicine very much in terms of genomics. That's because the gene is such a dominant metaphor, again, to use that same word, in medicine today, that we think the genome will drive the personalization of medicine. But of course the genome is just the bottom of a long chain of being, as it were. That chain of being, really the first organized unit of that, is the cell. So, if we are really going to deliver in medicine in this way, we have to think of personalizing cellular therapies, and then personalizing organ or organismal therapies, and ultimately personalizing immersion therapies for the environment. So I think at every stage, you know \u2014 there's that metaphor, there's turtles all the way. Well, in this, there's personalization all the way.CA: So when you say medicine could be a cell and not a pill, you're talking about potentially your own cells.SM: Absolutely. CA: So converted to stem cells, perhaps tested against all kinds of drugs or something, and prepared.SM: And there's no perhaps. This is what we're doing. This is what's happening, and in fact, we're slowly moving, not away from genomics, but incorporating genomics into what we call multi-order, semi-autonomous, self-regulating systems, like cells, like organs, like environments.CA: Thank you so much.SM: Pleasure.

something,\n\n00:01:58.278 --> 00:02:00.294\nthat it really swept through biology.\n\n00:02:00.318 --> 00:02:02.438\nIt was a transformation like no other.\n\n00:02:04.118 --> 00:02:07.294\nAnd we've really spent the last 100 years\n\n00:02:07.318 --> 00:02:10.774\ntrying to replicate that model\nover and over again\n\n00:02:10.798 --> 00:02:12.037\nin noninfectious diseases,\n\n00:02:12.061 --> 00:02:16.181\nin chronic diseases like diabetes\nand hypertension and heart disease.\n\n00:02:17.078 --> 00:02:20.717\nAnd it's worked,\nbut it's only worked partly.\n\n00:02:21.078 --> 00:02:22.734\nLet me show you.\n\n00:02:22.758 --> 00:02:25.654\nYou know, if you take the entire universe\n\n00:02:25.678 --> 00:02:29.174\nof all chemical reactions\nin the human body,\n\n00:02:29.198 --> 00:02:32.494\nevery chemical reaction\nthat your body is capable of,\n\n00:02:32.518 --> 00:02:35.534\nmost people think that that number\nis on the order of a million.\n\n00:02:35.558 --> 00:02:36.854\nLet's call it a million.\n\n00:02:36.878 --> 00:02:38.574\nAnd now you ask the question,\n\n00:02:38.598 --> 00:02:41.254\nwhat number or fraction of reactions\n\n00:02:41.278 --> 00:02:43.094\ncan actually be targeted\n\n00:02:43.118 --> 00:02:47.934\nby the entire pharmacopoeia,\nall of medicinal chemistry?\n\n00:02:47.958 --> 00:02:49.998\nThat number is 250.\n\n00:02:51.638 --> 00:02:54.174\nThe rest is chemical darkness.\n\n00:02:54.198 --> 00:03:00.374\nIn other words, 0.025 percent\nof all chemical reactions in your body\n\n00:03:00.398 --> 00:03:04.518\nare actually targetable\nby this lock and key mechanism.\n\n00:03:05.638 --> 00:03:08.694\nYou know, if you think\nabout human physiology\n\n00:03:08.718 --> 00:03:12.174\nas a vast global telephone network\n\n00:03:12.198 --> 00:03:16.078\nwith interacting nodes\nand interacting pieces,\n\n00:03:16.558 --> 00:03:19.734\nthen all of our medicinal chemistry\n\n00:03:19.758 --> 00:03:22.014\nis operating on one tiny corner\n\n00:03:22.038 --> 00:03:24.734\nat the edge, the outer edge,\nof that network.\n\n00:03:24.758 --> 00:03:28.574\nIt's like all of our\npharmaceutical chemistry\n\n00:03:28.598 --> 00:03:32.374\nis a pole operator in Wichita, Kansas\n\n00:03:32.398 --> 00:03:35.358\nwho is tinkering with about\n10 or 15 telephone lines.\n\n00:03:36.838 --> 00:03:38.998\nSo what do we do about this idea?\n\n00:03:40.118 --> 00:03:42.478\nWhat if we reorganized this approach?\n\n00:03:44.038 --> 00:03:47.414\nIn fact, it turns out\nthat the natural world\n\n00:03:47.438 --> 00:03:52.494\ngives us a sense of how one\nmight think about illness\n\n00:03:52.518 --> 00:03:54.174\nin a radically different way,\n\n00:03:54.198 --> 00:03:57.918\nrather than disease, medicine, target.\n\n00:03:59.038 --> 00:04:02.414\nIn fact, the natural world\nis organized hierarchically upwards,\n\n00:04:02.438 --> 00:04:04.294\nnot downwards, but upwards,\n\n00:04:04.318 --> 00:04:10.558\nand we begin with a self-regulating,\nsemi-autonomous unit called a cell.\n\n00:04:11.598 --> 00:04:14.814\nThese self-regulating,\nsemi-autonomous units\n\n00:04:14.838 --> 00:04:19.654\ngive rise to self-regulating,\nsemi-autonomous units called organs,\n\n00:04:19.678 --> 00:04:22.678\nand these organs coalesce\nto form things called humans,\n\n00:04:23.878 --> 00:04:27.774\nand these organisms\nultimately live in environments,\n\n00:04:27.798 --> 00:04:31.398\nwhich are partly self-regulating\nand partly semi-autonomous.\n\n00:04:32.878 --> 00:04:35.694\nWhat's nice about this scheme,\nthis hierarchical scheme\n\n00:04:35.718 --> 00:04:38.414\nbuilding upwards rather than downwards,\n\n00:04:38.438 --> 00:04:41.814\nis that it allows us\nto think about illness as well\n\n00:04:41.838 --> 00:04:43.172\nin a somewhat different way.\n\n00:04:44.358 --> 00:04:46.478\nTake a disease like cancer.\n\n00:04:48.078 --> 00:04:49.374\nSince the 1950s,\n\n00:04:49.398 --> 00:04:54.925\nwe've tried rather desperately to apply\nthis lock and key model to cancer.\n\n00:04:54.949 --> 00:04:57.838\nWe've tried to kill cells\n\n00:04:57.863 --> 00:05:02.210\nusing a variety of chemotherapies \nor targeted therapies,\n\n00:05:02.234 --> 00:05:04.654\nand as most of us know, that's worked.\n\n00:05:04.678 --> 00:05:06.536\nIt's worked for diseases like leukemia.\n\n00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:08.934\nIt's worked for some forms\nof breast cancer,\n\n00:05:08.958 --> 00:05:12.694\nbut eventually you run\nto the ceiling of that approach.\n\n00:05:12.718 --> 00:05:15.214\nAnd it's only in the last 10 years or so\n\n00:05:15.238 --> 00:05:18.374\nthat we've begun to think\nabout using the immune system,\n\n00:05:18.398 --> 00:05:21.494\nremembering that in fact the cancer cell\ndoesn't grow in a vacuum.\n\n00:05:21.518 --> 00:05:23.574\nIt actually grows in a human organism.\n\n00:05:23.598 --> 00:05:25.894\nAnd could you use the organismal capacity,\n\n00:05:25.918 --> 00:05:29.061\nthe fact that human beings\nhave an immune system, to attack cancer?\n\n00:05:29.085 --> 00:05:33.285\nIn fact, it's led to the some of the most\nspectacular new medicines in cancer.\n\n00:05:34.438 --> 00:05:37.772\nAnd finally there's the level\nof the environment, isn't there?\n\n00:05:38.118 --> 00:05:41.094\nYou know, we don't think of cancer\nas altering the environment.\n\n00:05:41.118 --> 00:05:46.014\nBut let me give you an example\nof a profoundly carcinogenic environment.\n\n00:05:46.038 --> 00:05:47.238\nIt's called a prison.\n\n00:05:48.118 --> 00:05:53.254\nYou take loneliness, you take depression,\nyou take confinement,\n\n00:05:53.278 --> 00:05:54.478\nand you add to that,\n\n00:05:55.358 --> 00:05:57.918\nrolled up in a little\nwhite sheet of paper,\n\n00:05:58.958 --> 00:06:02.734\none of the most potent neurostimulants\nthat we know, called nicotine,\n\n00:06:02.758 --> 00:06:07.694\nand you add to that one of the most potent\naddictive substances that you know,\n\n00:06:07.718 --> 00:06:10.514\nand you have\na pro-carcinogenic environment.\n\n00:06:11.478 --> 00:06:13.934\nBut you can have anti-carcinogenic\nenvironments too.\n\n00:06:13.958 --> 00:06:16.654\nThere are attempts to create milieus,\n\n00:06:16.678 --> 00:06:19.440\nchange the hormonal milieu\nfor breast cancer, for instance.\n\n00:06:20.398 --> 00:06:23.814\nWe're trying to change the metabolic\nmilieu for other forms of cancer.\n\n00:06:23.838 --> 00:06:26.254\nOr take another disease, like depression.\n\n00:06:26.278 --> 00:06:28.934\nAgain, working upwards,\n\n00:06:28.958 --> 00:06:32.974\nsince the 1960s and 1970s,\nwe've tried, again, desperately\n\n00:06:32.998 --> 00:06:37.174\nto turn off molecules\nthat operate between nerve cells --\n\n00:06:37.198 --> 00:06:39.374\nserotonin, dopamine --\n\n00:06:39.398 --> 00:06:41.214\nand tried to cure depression that way,\n\n00:06:41.238 --> 00:06:43.678\nand that's worked,\nbut then that reached the limit.\n\n00:06:44.958 --> 00:06:47.578\nAnd we now know that what you\nreally probably need to do\n\n00:06:47.602 --> 00:06:50.574\nis to change the physiology\nof the organ, the brain,\n\n00:06:50.598 --> 00:06:52.734\nrewire it, remodel it,\n\n00:06:52.758 --> 00:06:55.334\nand that, of course,\nwe know study upon study has shown\n\n00:06:55.358 --> 00:06:57.073\nthat talk therapy does exactly that,\n\n00:06:57.097 --> 00:06:59.353\nand study upon study\nhas shown that talk therapy\n\n00:06:59.377 --> 00:07:02.494\ncombined with medicines, pills,\n\n00:07:02.518 --> 00:07:04.947\nreally is much more effective\nthan either one alone.\n\n00:07:05.798 --> 00:07:09.374\nCan we imagine a more immersive\nenvironment that will change depression?\n\n00:07:09.398 --> 00:07:13.454\nCan you lock out the signals\nthat elicit depression?\n\n00:07:13.478 --> 00:07:18.958\nAgain, moving upwards along this\nhierarchical chain of organization.\n\n00:07:19.718 --> 00:07:22.414\nWhat's really at stake perhaps here\n\n00:07:22.438 --> 00:07:25.694\nis not the medicine itself but a metaphor.\n\n00:07:25.718 --> 00:07:27.774\nRather than killing something,\n\n00:07:27.798 --> 00:07:31.494\nin the case of the great\nchronic degenerative diseases --\n\n00:07:31.518 --> 00:07:35.014\nkidney failure, diabetes,\nhypertension, osteoarthritis --\n\n00:07:35.038 --> 00:07:38.610\nmaybe what we really need to do is change\nthe metaphor to growing something.\n\n00:07:38.634 --> 00:07:40.574\nAnd that's the key, perhaps,\n\n00:07:40.598 --> 00:07:43.094\nto reframing our thinking about medicine.\n\n00:07:43.118 --> 00:07:46.574\nNow, this idea of changing,\n\n00:07:46.598 --> 00:07:48.934\nof creating a perceptual\nshift, as it were,\n\n00:07:48.958 --> 00:07:52.254\ncame home to me to roost in a very\npersonal manner about 10 years ago.\n\n00:07:52.278 --> 00:07:55.054\nAbout 10 years ago --\nI've been a runner most of my life --\n\n00:07:55.078 --> 00:07:57.054\nI went for a run, a Saturday morning run,\n\n00:07:57.078 --> 00:07:59.734\nI came back and woke up\nand I basically couldn't move.\n\n00:07:59.758 --> 00:08:01.774\nMy right knee was swollen up,\n\n00:08:01.798 --> 00:08:05.318\nand you could hear that ominous crunch\nof bone against bone.\n\n00:08:06.198 --> 00:08:11.094\nAnd one of the perks of being a physician\nis that you get to order your own MRIs.\n\n00:08:11.118 --> 00:08:15.094\nAnd I had an MRI the next week,\nand it looked like that.\n\n00:08:15.118 --> 00:08:19.414\nEssentially, the meniscus of cartilage\nthat is between bone\n\n00:08:19.438 --> 00:08:22.854\nhad been completely torn\nand the bone itself had been shattered.\n\n00:08:22.878 --> 00:08:25.334\nNow, if you're looking at me\nand feeling sorry,\n\n00:08:25.358 --> 00:08:27.174\nlet me tell you a few facts.\n\n00:08:27.198 --> 00:08:31.374\nIf I was to take an MRI\nof every person in this audience,\n\n00:08:31.398 --> 00:08:33.454\n60 percent of you would show signs\n\n00:08:33.478 --> 00:08:36.254\nof bone degeneration\nand cartilage degeneration like this.\n\n00:08:36.278 --> 00:08:40.054\n85 percent of all women by the age of 70\n\n00:08:40.078 --> 00:08:43.334\nwould show moderate to severe\ncartilage degeneration.\n\n00:08:43.358 --> 00:08:45.654\n50 to 60 percent\nof the men in this audience\n\n00:08:45.678 --> 00:08:47.014\nwould also have such signs.\n\n00:08:47.038 --> 00:08:48.814\nSo this is a very common disease.\n\n00:08:48.838 --> 00:08:50.934\nWell, the second perk of being a physician\n\n00:08:50.958 --> 00:08:54.093\nis that you can get\nto experiment on your own ailments.\n\n00:08:54.117 --> 00:08:56.334\nSo about 10 years ago we began,\n\n00:08:56.358 --> 00:08:58.774\nwe brought this process\ninto the laboratory,\n\n00:08:58.798 --> 00:09:00.814\nand we began to do simple experiments,\n\n00:09:00.838 --> 00:09:03.294\nmechanically trying\nto fix this degeneration.\n\n00:09:03.318 --> 00:09:08.134\nWe tried to inject chemicals\ninto the knee spaces of animals\n\n00:09:08.158 --> 00:09:10.814\nto try to reverse cartilage degeneration,\n\n00:09:10.838 --> 00:09:15.374\nand to put a short summary\non a very long and painful process,\n\n00:09:15.398 --> 00:09:17.174\nessentially it came to naught.\n\n00:09:17.198 --> 00:09:18.398\nNothing happened.\n\n00:09:18.838 --> 00:09:23.614\nAnd then about seven years ago,\nwe had a research student from Australia.\n\n00:09:23.638 --> 00:09:25.163\nThe nice thing about Australians\n\n00:09:25.163 --> 00:09:28.479\nis that they're habitually used to\nlooking at the world upside down.\n\n00:09:28.504 --> 00:09:29.661\n(Laughter)\n\n00:09:29.685 --> 00:09:33.774\nAnd so Dan suggested to me, \"You know,\nmaybe it isn't a mechanical problem.\n\n00:09:33.798 --> 00:09:37.798\nMaybe it isn't a chemical problem.\nMaybe it's a stem cell problem.\"\n\n00:09:39.718 --> 00:09:41.614\nIn other words, he had two hypotheses.\n\n00:09:41.638 --> 00:09:45.454\nNumber one, there is such a thing\nas a skeletal stem cell --\n\n00:09:45.478 --> 00:09:48.998\na skeletal stem cell that builds up\nthe entire vertebrate skeleton,\n\n00:09:49.022 --> 00:09:51.554\nbone, cartilage and the fibrous\nelements of skeleton,\n\n00:09:51.578 --> 00:09:53.443\njust like there's a stem cell in blood,\n\n00:09:53.468 --> 00:09:55.903\njust like there's a stem cell\nin the nervous system.\n\n00:09:55.927 --> 00:09:59.487\nAnd two, that maybe that, the degeneration\nor dysfunction of this stem cell\n\n00:09:59.512 --> 00:10:03.014\nis what's causing osteochondral arthritis,\na very common ailment.\n\n00:10:03.038 --> 00:10:06.254\nSo really the question was,\nwere we looking for a pill\n\n00:10:06.278 --> 00:10:08.894\nwhen we should have really\nbeen looking for a cell.\n\n00:10:08.918 --> 00:10:11.774\nSo we switched our models,\n\n00:10:11.798 --> 00:10:14.918\nand now we began\nto look for skeletal stem cells.\n\n00:10:15.518 --> 00:10:18.014\nAnd to cut again a long story short,\n\n00:10:18.038 --> 00:10:20.958\nabout five years ago,\nwe found these cells.\n\n00:10:21.758 --> 00:10:24.254\nThey live inside the skeleton.\n\n00:10:24.278 --> 00:10:27.174\nHere's a schematic and then\na real photograph of one of them.\n\n00:10:27.198 --> 00:10:29.134\nThe white stuff is bone,\n\n00:10:29.158 --> 00:10:32.174\nand these red columns that you see\nand the yellow cells\n\n00:10:32.198 --> 00:10:35.454\nare cells that have arisen\nfrom one single skeletal stem cell --\n\n00:10:35.478 --> 00:10:38.774\ncolumns of cartilage, columns of bone\ncoming out of a single cell.\n\n00:10:38.798 --> 00:10:42.094\nThese cells are fascinating.\nThey have four properties.\n\n00:10:42.118 --> 00:10:45.894\nNumber one is that they live\nwhere they're expected to live.\n\n00:10:45.918 --> 00:10:48.294\nThey live just underneath\nthe surface of the bone,\n\n00:10:48.318 --> 00:10:49.854\nunderneath cartilage.\n\n00:10:49.878 --> 00:10:52.498\nYou know, in biology,\nit's location, location, location.\n\n00:10:52.522 --> 00:10:56.774\nAnd they move into the appropriate areas\nand form bone and cartilage.\n\n00:10:56.798 --> 00:10:58.054\nThat's one.\n\n00:10:58.078 --> 00:10:59.614\nHere's an interesting property.\n\n00:10:59.638 --> 00:11:02.294\nYou can take them out\nof the vertebrate skeleton,\n\n00:11:02.318 --> 00:11:04.894\nyou can culture them\nin petri dishes in the laboratory,\n\n00:11:04.918 --> 00:11:06.894\nand they are dying to form cartilage.\n\n00:11:06.918 --> 00:11:09.640\nRemember how we couldn't\nform cartilage for love or money?\n\n00:11:09.664 --> 00:11:11.583\nThese cells are dying to form cartilage.\n\n00:11:11.608 --> 00:11:14.613\nThey form their own furls\nof cartilage around themselves.\n\n00:11:14.638 --> 00:11:16.254\nThey're also, number three,\n\n00:11:16.278 --> 00:11:20.454\nthe most efficient repairers\nof fractures that we've ever encountered.\n\n00:11:20.478 --> 00:11:23.774\nThis is a little bone,\na mouse bone that we fractured\n\n00:11:23.798 --> 00:11:25.334\nand then let it heal by itself.\n\n00:11:25.358 --> 00:11:28.374\nThese stem cells have come in\nand repaired, in yellow, the bone,\n\n00:11:28.398 --> 00:11:31.014\nin white, the cartilage,\nalmost completely.\n\n00:11:31.038 --> 00:11:34.574\nSo much so that if you label them\nwith a fluorescent dye\n\n00:11:34.598 --> 00:11:38.334\nyou can see them like some kind\nof peculiar cellular glue\n\n00:11:38.358 --> 00:11:40.214\ncoming into the area of a fracture,\n\n00:11:40.238 --> 00:11:43.214\nfixing it locally\nand then stopping their work.\n\n00:11:43.238 --> 00:11:45.574\nNow, the fourth one is the most ominous,\n\n00:11:45.598 --> 00:11:49.734\nand that is that their numbers\ndecline precipitously,\n\n00:11:49.758 --> 00:11:54.454\nprecipitously, tenfold,\nfiftyfold, as you age.\n\n00:11:54.478 --> 00:11:56.054\nAnd so what had happened, really,\n\n00:11:56.078 --> 00:11:58.934\nis that we found ourselves\nin a perceptual shift.\n\n00:11:58.958 --> 00:12:01.694\nWe had gone hunting for pills\n\n00:12:01.718 --> 00:12:04.214\nbut we ended up finding theories.\n\n00:12:04.238 --> 00:12:05.454\nAnd in some ways\n\n00:12:05.478 --> 00:12:08.094\nwe had hooked ourselves\nback onto this idea:\n\n00:12:08.118 --> 00:12:11.014\ncells, organisms, environments,\n\n00:12:11.038 --> 00:12:13.614\nbecause we were now thinking\nabout bone stem cells,\n\n00:12:13.638 --> 00:12:17.078\nwe were thinking about arthritis\nin terms of a cellular disease.\n\n00:12:17.798 --> 00:12:20.084\nAnd then the next question was,\nare there organs?\n\n00:12:20.108 --> 00:12:22.347\nCan you build this\nas an organ outside the body?\n\n00:12:22.371 --> 00:12:26.214\nCan you implant cartilage\ninto areas of trauma?\n\n00:12:26.238 --> 00:12:28.214\nAnd perhaps most interestingly,\n\n00:12:28.238 --> 00:12:30.614\ncan you ascend right up\nand create environments?\n\n00:12:30.638 --> 00:12:33.694\nYou know, we know\nthat exercise remodels bone,\n\n00:12:33.718 --> 00:12:36.134\nbut come on, none of us\nis going to exercise.\n\n00:12:36.158 --> 00:12:41.334\nSo could you imagine ways of passively\nloading and unloading bone\n\n00:12:41.358 --> 00:12:46.174\nso that you can recreate\nor regenerate degenerating cartilage?\n\n00:12:46.198 --> 00:12:48.579\nAnd perhaps more interesting,\nand more importantly,\n\n00:12:48.603 --> 00:12:52.054\nthe question is, can you apply this model\nmore globally outside medicine?\n\n00:12:52.078 --> 00:12:56.134\nWhat's at stake, as I said before,\nis not killing something,\n\n00:12:56.158 --> 00:12:57.598\nbut growing something.\n\n00:12:58.238 --> 00:13:03.054\nAnd it raises a series of, I think,\nsome of the most interesting questions\n\n00:13:03.078 --> 00:13:05.598\nabout how we think\nabout medicine in the future.\n\n00:13:06.998 --> 00:13:09.878\nCould your medicine\nbe a cell and not a pill?\n\n00:13:10.798 --> 00:13:13.174\nHow would we grow these cells?\n\n00:13:13.198 --> 00:13:16.214\nWhat we would we do to stop\nthe malignant growth of these cells?\n\n00:13:16.238 --> 00:13:20.134\nWe heard about the problems\nof unleashing growth.\n\n00:13:20.158 --> 00:13:22.934\nCould we implant\nsuicide genes into these cells\n\n00:13:22.958 --> 00:13:24.398\nto stop them from growing?\n\n00:13:24.998 --> 00:13:28.934\nCould your medicine be an organ\nthat's created outside the body\n\n00:13:28.958 --> 00:13:30.894\nand then implanted into the body?\n\n00:13:30.918 --> 00:13:33.654\nCould that stop some of the degeneration?\n\n00:13:33.678 --> 00:13:35.583\nWhat if the organ needed to have memory?\n\n00:13:35.607 --> 00:13:40.374\nIn cases of diseases of the nervous system\nsome of those organs had memory.\n\n00:13:40.398 --> 00:13:42.854\nHow could we implant\nthose memories back in?\n\n00:13:42.878 --> 00:13:44.694\nCould we store these organs?\n\n00:13:44.718 --> 00:13:47.861\nWould each organ have to be developed\nfor an individual human being\n\n00:13:47.885 --> 00:13:49.085\nand put back?\n\n00:13:50.478 --> 00:13:53.094\nAnd perhaps most puzzlingly,\n\n00:13:53.118 --> 00:13:54.928\ncould your medicine be an environment?\n\n00:13:56.118 --> 00:13:57.774\nCould you patent an environment?\n\n00:13:57.798 --> 00:14:01.254\nYou know, in every culture,\n\n00:14:01.278 --> 00:14:04.214\nshamans have been using\nenvironments as medicines.\n\n00:14:04.238 --> 00:14:06.558\nCould we imagine that for our future?\n\n00:14:08.038 --> 00:14:11.414\nI've talked a lot about models.\nI began this talk with models.\n\n00:14:11.438 --> 00:14:14.134\nSo let me end with some thoughts\nabout model building.\n\n00:14:14.158 --> 00:14:16.254\nThat's what we do as scientists.\n\n00:14:16.278 --> 00:14:19.574\nYou know, when an architect\nbuilds a model,\n\n00:14:19.598 --> 00:14:22.894\nhe or she is trying to show you\na world in miniature.\n\n00:14:22.918 --> 00:14:25.814\nBut when a scientist is building a model,\n\n00:14:25.838 --> 00:14:28.362\nhe or she is trying to show you\nthe world in metaphor.\n\n00:14:29.558 --> 00:14:33.414\nHe or she is trying to create\na new way of seeing.\n\n00:14:33.438 --> 00:14:37.558\nThe former is a scale shift.\nThe latter is a perceptual shift.\n\n00:14:38.878 --> 00:14:43.814\nNow, antibiotics created\nsuch a perceptual shift\n\n00:14:43.838 --> 00:14:47.654\nin our way of thinking about medicine\nthat it really colored, distorted,\n\n00:14:47.678 --> 00:14:51.598\nvery successfully, the way we've thought\nabout medicine for the last hundred years.\n\n00:14:52.358 --> 00:14:56.774\nBut we need new models\nto think about medicine in the future.\n\n00:14:56.798 --> 00:14:58.278\nThat's what's at stake.\n\n00:14:59.438 --> 00:15:02.774\nYou know, there's\na popular trope out there\n\n00:15:02.798 --> 00:15:06.774\nthat the reason we haven't had\nthe transformative impact\n\n00:15:06.798 --> 00:15:08.774\non the treatment of illness\n\n00:15:08.798 --> 00:15:11.654\nis because we don't have\npowerful-enough drugs,\n\n00:15:11.678 --> 00:15:13.038\nand that's partly true.\n\n00:15:14.078 --> 00:15:15.574\nBut perhaps the real reason is\n\n00:15:15.598 --> 00:15:18.798\nthat we don't have powerful-enough\nways of thinking about medicines.\n\n00:15:20.518 --> 00:15:22.934\nIt's certainly true that\n\n00:15:22.958 --> 00:15:26.734\nit would be lovely to have new medicines.\n\n00:15:26.758 --> 00:15:31.414\nBut perhaps what's really at stake\nare three more intangible M's:\n\n00:15:31.438 --> 00:15:35.254\nmechanisms, models, metaphors.\n\n00:15:35.278 --> 00:15:36.614\nThank you.\n\n00:15:36.638 --> 00:15:43.478\n(Applause)\n\n00:15:45.558 --> 00:15:48.974\nChris Anderson:\nI really like this metaphor.\n\n00:15:48.998 --> 00:15:50.534\nHow does it link in?\n\n00:15:50.558 --> 00:15:53.694\nThere's a lot of talk in technologyland\n\n00:15:53.718 --> 00:15:55.854\nabout the personalization of medicine,\n\n00:15:55.878 --> 00:15:59.294\nthat we have all this data\nand that medical treatments of the future\n\n00:15:59.318 --> 00:16:03.814\nwill be for you specifically,\nyour genome, your current context.\n\n00:16:03.838 --> 00:16:07.774\nDoes that apply to this model\nyou've got here?\n\n00:16:07.798 --> 00:16:10.414\nSiddhartha Mukherjee:\nIt's a very interesting question.\n\n00:16:10.438 --> 00:16:12.654\nWe've thought about\npersonalization of medicine\n\n00:16:12.678 --> 00:16:14.214\nvery much in terms of genomics.\n\n00:16:14.238 --> 00:16:16.814\nThat's because the gene\nis such a dominant metaphor,\n\n00:16:16.838 --> 00:16:19.814\nagain, to use that same word,\nin medicine today,\n\n00:16:19.838 --> 00:16:23.574\nthat we think the genome will drive\nthe personalization of medicine.\n\n00:16:23.598 --> 00:16:26.694\nBut of course the genome\nis just the bottom\n\n00:16:26.718 --> 00:16:30.534\nof a long chain of being, as it were.\n\n00:16:30.558 --> 00:16:34.374\nThat chain of being, really the first\norganized unit of that, is the cell.\n\n00:16:34.398 --> 00:16:37.374\nSo, if we are really going to deliver\nin medicine in this way,\n\n00:16:37.398 --> 00:16:40.214\nwe have to think of personalizing\ncellular therapies,\n\n00:16:40.238 --> 00:16:43.414\nand then personalizing\norgan or organismal therapies,\n\n00:16:43.438 --> 00:16:47.254\nand ultimately personalizing\nimmersion therapies for the environment.\n\n00:16:47.278 --> 00:16:50.374\nSo I think at every stage, you know --\n\n00:16:50.398 --> 00:16:52.814\nthere's that metaphor,\nthere's turtles all the way.\n\n00:16:52.838 --> 00:16:55.219\nWell, in this, there's\npersonalization all the way.\n\n00:16:55.243 --> 00:16:58.134\nCA: So when you say\nmedicine could be a cell\n\n00:16:58.158 --> 00:16:59.974\nand not a pill,\n\n00:16:59.998 --> 00:17:02.254\nyou're talking about\npotentially your own cells.\n\n00:17:02.278 --> 00:17:04.654\nSM: Absolutely.\nCA: So converted to stem cells,\n\n00:17:04.678 --> 00:17:09.214\nperhaps tested against all kinds\nof drugs or something, and prepared.\n\n00:17:09.238 --> 00:17:11.774\nSM: And there's no perhaps.\nThis is what we're doing.\n\n00:17:11.798 --> 00:17:15.534\nThis is what's happening,\nand in fact, we're slowly moving,\n\n00:17:15.558 --> 00:17:19.373\nnot away from genomics,\nbut incorporating genomics\n\n00:17:19.398 --> 00:17:24.133\ninto what we call multi-order,\nsemi-autonomous, self-regulating systems,\n\n00:17:24.158 --> 00:17:26.774\nlike cells, like organs,\nlike environments.\n\n00:17:26.787 --> 00:17:28.165\nCA: Thank you so much.\n\n00:17:28.185 --> 00:17:29.475\nSM: Pleasure. Thanks."}, {"title": "Design at the intersection of technology and biology", "duration": "1056", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/neri_oxman_design_at_the_intersection_of_technology_and_biology", "transcript": "Two twin domes, two radically opposed design cultures. One is made of thousands of steel parts, the other of a single silk thread. One is synthetic, the other organic. One is imposed on the environment, the other creates it. One is designed for nature, the other is designed by her.Michelangelo said that when he looked at raw marble, he saw a figure struggling to be free. The chisel was Michelangelo's only tool. But living things are not chiseled. They grow. And in our smallest units of life, our cells, we carry all the information that's required for every other cell to function and to replicate.Tools also have consequences. At least since the Industrial Revolution, the world of design has been dominated by the rigors of manufacturing and mass production. Assembly lines have dictated a world made of parts, framing the imagination of designers and architects who have been trained to think about their objects as assemblies of discrete parts with distinct functions.But you don't find homogenous material assemblies in nature. Take human skin, for example. Our facial skins are thin with large pores. Our back skins are thicker, with small pores. One acts mainly as filter, the other mainly as barrier, and yet it's the same skin: no parts, no assemblies. It's a system that gradually varies its functionality by varying elasticity. So here this is a split screen to represent my split world view, the split personality of every designer and architect operating today between the chisel and the gene, between machine and organism, between assembly and growth, between Henry Ford and Charles Darwin. These two worldviews, my left brain and right brain, analysis and synthesis, will play out on the two screens behind me. My work, at its simplest level, is about uniting these two worldviews, moving away from assembly and closer into growth.You're probably asking yourselves: Why now? Why was this not possible 10 or even five years ago? We live in a very special time in history, a rare time, a time when the confluence of four fields is giving designers access to tools we've never had access to before. These fields are computational design, allowing us to design complex forms with simple code; additive manufacturing, letting us produce parts by adding material rather than carving it out; materials engineering, which lets us design the behavior of materials in high resolution; and synthetic biology, enabling us to design new biological functionality by editing DNA. And at the intersection of these four fields, my team and I create. Please meet the minds and hands of my students.We design objects and products and structures and tools across scales, from the large-scale, like this robotic arm with an 80-foot diameter reach with a vehicular base that will one day soon print entire buildings, to nanoscale graphics made entirely of genetically engineered microorganisms that glow in the dark. Here we've reimagined the mashrabiya, an archetype of ancient Arabic architecture, and created a screen where every aperture is uniquely sized to shape the form of light and heat moving through it.In our next project, we explore the possibility of creating a cape and skirt \u2014 this was for a Paris fashion show with Iris van Herpen \u2014 like a second skin that are made of a single part, stiff at the contours, flexible around the waist. Together with my long-term 3D printing collaborator Stratasys, we 3D-printed this cape and skirt with no seams between the cells, and I'll show more objects like it. This helmet combines stiff and soft materials in 20-micron resolution. This is the resolution of a human hair. It's also the resolution of a CT scanner. That designers have access to such high-resolution analytic and synthetic tools, enables to design products that fit not only the shape of our bodies, but also the physiological makeup of our tissues. Next, we designed an acoustic chair, a chair that would be at once structural, comfortable and would also absorb sound. Professor Carter, my collaborator, and I turned to nature for inspiration, and by designing this irregular surface pattern, it becomes sound-absorbent. We printed its surface out of 44 different properties, varying in rigidity, opacity and color, corresponding to pressure points on the human body. Its surface, as in nature, varies its functionality not by adding another material or another assembly, but by continuously and delicately varying material property.But is nature ideal? Are there no parts in nature? I wasn't raised in a religious Jewish home, but when I was young, my grandmother used to tell me stories from the Hebrew Bible, and one of them stuck with me and came to define much of what I care about. As she recounts: \"On the third day of Creation, God commands the Earth to grow a fruit-bearing fruit tree.\" For this first fruit tree, there was to be no differentiation between trunk, branches, leaves and fruit. The whole tree was a fruit. Instead, the land grew trees that have bark and stems and flowers. The land created a world made of parts. I often ask myself, \"What would design be like if objects were made of a single part? Would we return to a better state of creation?\"So we looked for that biblical material, that fruit-bearing fruit tree kind of material, and we found it. The second-most abundant biopolymer on the planet is called chitin, and some 100 million tons of it are produced every year by organisms such as shrimps, crabs, scorpions and butterflies. We thought if we could tune its properties, we could generate structures that are multifunctional out of a single part. So that's what we did. We called Legal Seafood \u2014(Laughter)we ordered a bunch of shrimp shells, we grinded them and we produced chitosan paste. By varying chemical concentrations, we were able to achieve a wide array of properties \u2014 from dark, stiff and opaque, to light, soft and transparent. In order to print the structures in large scale, we built a robotically controlled extrusion system with multiple nozzles. The robot would vary material properties on the fly and create these 12-foot-long structures made of a single material, 100 percent recyclable. When the parts are ready, they're left to dry and find a form naturally upon contact with air. So why are we still designing with plastics? The air bubbles that were a byproduct of the printing process were used to contain photosynthetic microorganisms that first appeared on our planet 3.5 billion year ago, as we learned yesterday. Together with our collaborators at Harvard and MIT, we embedded bacteria that were genetically engineered to rapidly capture carbon from the atmosphere and convert it into sugar. For the first time, we were able to generate structures that would seamlessly transition from beam to mesh, and if scaled even larger, to windows. A fruit-bearing fruit tree. Working with an ancient material, one of the first lifeforms on the planet, plenty of water and a little bit of synthetic biology, we were able to transform a structure made of shrimp shells into an architecture that behaves like a tree. And here's the best part: for objects designed to biodegrade, put them in the sea, and they will nourish marine life; place them in soil, and they will help grow a tree.The setting for our next exploration using the same design principles was the solar system. We looked for the possibility of creating life-sustaining clothing for interplanetary voyages. To do that, we needed to contain bacteria and be able to control their flow. So like the periodic table, we came up with our own table of the elements: new lifeforms that were computationally grown, additively manufactured and biologically augmented. I like to think of synthetic biology as liquid alchemy, only instead of transmuting precious metals, you're synthesizing new biological functionality inside very small channels. It's called microfluidics. We 3D-printed our own channels in order to control the flow of these liquid bacterial cultures. In our first piece of clothing, we combined two microorganisms. The first is cyanobacteria. It lives in our oceans and in freshwater ponds. And the second, E. coli, the bacterium that inhabits the human gut. One converts light into sugar, the other consumes that sugar and produces biofuels useful for the built environment. Now, these two microorganisms never interact in nature. In fact, they never met each other. They've been here, engineered for the first time, to have a relationship inside a piece of clothing. Think of it as evolution not by natural selection, but evolution by design. In order to contain these relationships, we've created a single channel that resembles the digestive tract, that will help flow these bacteria and alter their function along the way. We then started growing these channels on the human body, varying material properties according to the desired functionality. Where we wanted more photosynthesis, we would design more transparent channels. This wearable digestive system, when it's stretched end to end, spans 60 meters. This is half the length of a football field, and 10 times as long as our small intestines. And here it is for the first time unveiled at TED \u2014 our first photosynthetic wearable, liquid channels glowing with life inside a wearable clothing.(Applause)Thank you.Mary Shelley said, \"We are unfashioned creatures, but only half made up.\" What if design could provide that other half? What if we could create structures that would augment living matter? What if we could create personal microbiomes that would scan our skins, repair damaged tissue and sustain our bodies? Think of this as a form of edited biology. This entire collection, Wanderers, that was named after planets, was not to me really about fashion per se, but it provided an opportunity to speculate about the future of our race on our planet and beyond, to combine scientific insight with lots of mystery and to move away from the age of the machine to a new age of symbiosis between our bodies, the microorganisms that we inhabit, our products and even our buildings. I call this material ecology.To do this, we always need to return back to nature. By now, you know that a 3D printer prints material in layers. You also know that nature doesn't. It grows. It adds with sophistication. This silkworm cocoon, for example, creates a highly sophisticated architecture, a home inside which to metamorphisize. No additive manufacturing today gets even close to this level of sophistication. It does so by combining not two materials, but two proteins in different concentrations. One acts as the structure, the other is the glue, or the matrix, holding those fibers together. And this happens across scales. The silkworm first attaches itself to the environment \u2014 it creates a tensile structure \u2014 and it then starts spinning a compressive cocoon. Tension and compression, the two forces of life, manifested in a single material.In order to better understand how this complex process works, we glued a tiny earth magnet to the head of a silkworm, to the spinneret. We placed it inside a box with magnetic sensors, and that allowed us to create this 3-dimensional point cloud and visualize the complex architecture of the silkworm cocoon. However, when we placed the silkworm on a flat patch, not inside a box, we realized it would spin a flat cocoon and it would still healthily metamorphisize. So we started designing different environments, different scaffolds, and we discovered that the shape, the composition, the structure of the cocoon, was directly informed by the environment.Silkworms are often boiled to death inside their cocoons, their silk unraveled and used in the textile industry. We realized that designing these templates allowed us to give shape to raw silk without boiling a single cocoon.(Applause)They would healthily metamorphisize, and we would be able to create these things.So we scaled this process up to architectural scale. We had a robot spin the template out of silk, and we placed it on our site. We knew silkworms migrated toward darker and colder areas, so we used a sun path diagram to reveal the distribution of light and heat on our structure. We then created holes, or apertures, that would lock in the rays of light and heat, distributing those silkworms on the structure.We were ready to receive the caterpillars. We ordered 6,500 silkworms from an online silk farm. And after four weeks of feeding, they were ready to spin with us. We placed them carefully at the bottom rim of the scaffold, and as they spin they pupate, they mate, they lay eggs, and life begins all over again \u2014 just like us but much, much shorter.Bucky Fuller said that tension is the great integrity, and he was right. As they spin biological silk over robotically spun silk, they give this entire pavilion its integrity. And over two to three weeks, 6,500 silkworms spin 6,500 kilometers. In a curious symmetry, this is also the length of the Silk Road. The moths, after they hatch, produce 1.5 million eggs. This could be used for 250 additional pavilions for the future.So here they are, the two worldviews. One spins silk out of a robotic arm, the other fills in the gaps.If the final frontier of design is to breathe life into the products and the buildings around us, to form a two-material ecology, then designers must unite these two worldviews. Which brings us back, of course, to the beginning. Here's to a new age of design, a new age of creation, that takes us from a nature-inspired design to a design-inspired nature, and that demands of us for the first time that we mother nature.Thank you.(Applause)Thank you very much. Thank you.(Applause)", "id": 2344, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:12.995 --> 00:00:15.642\nTwo twin domes,\n\n00:00:15.666 --> 00:00:19.096\ntwo radically opposed design cultures.\n\n00:00:19.667 --> 00:00:22.707\nOne is made of thousands of steel parts,\n\n00:00:22.731 --> 00:00:25.507\nthe other of a single silk thread.\n\n00:00:25.993 --> 00:00:28.459\nOne is synthetic, the other organic.\n\n00:00:28.894 --> 00:00:31.171\nOne is imposed on the environment,\n\n00:00:31.195 --> 00:00:33.288\nthe other creates it.\n\n00:00:33.624 --> 00:00:37.258\nOne is designed for nature,\nthe other is designed by her.\n\n00:00:37.990 --> 00:00:40.883\nMichelangelo said that\nwhen he looked at raw marble,\n\n00:00:40.907 --> 00:00:43.359\nhe saw a figure struggling to be free.\n\n00:00:43.383 --> 00:00:47.505\nThe chisel was Michelangelo's only tool.\n\n00:00:49.219 --> 00:00:51.403\nBut living things are not chiseled.\n\n00:00:51.957 --> 00:00:53.141\nThey grow.\n\n00:00:53.957 --> 00:00:59.423\nAnd in our smallest units of life,\nour cells, we carry all the information\n\n00:00:59.447 --> 00:01:04.815\nthat's required for every other cell\nto function and to replicate.\n\n00:01:06.113 --> 00:01:08.342\nTools also have consequences.\n\n00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:13.490\nAt least since the Industrial Revolution,\nthe world of design has been dominated\n\n00:01:13.514 --> 00:01:16.185\nby the rigors of manufacturing\nand mass production.\n\n00:01:16.661 --> 00:01:19.933\nAssembly lines have dictated\na world made of parts,\n\n00:01:19.957 --> 00:01:22.549\nframing the imagination\nof designers and architects\n\n00:01:22.573 --> 00:01:25.677\nwho have been trained to think\nabout their objects as assemblies\n\n00:01:25.701 --> 00:01:29.075\nof discrete parts with distinct functions.\n\n00:01:30.123 --> 00:01:34.813\nBut you don't find homogenous\nmaterial assemblies in nature.\n\n00:01:35.392 --> 00:01:37.646\nTake human skin, for example.\n\n00:01:38.012 --> 00:01:41.580\nOur facial skins are thin\nwith large pores.\n\n00:01:41.957 --> 00:01:45.040\nOur back skins are thicker,\nwith small pores.\n\n00:01:45.517 --> 00:01:48.135\nOne acts mainly as filter,\n\n00:01:48.159 --> 00:01:49.923\nthe other mainly as barrier,\n\n00:01:49.947 --> 00:01:54.215\nand yet it's the same skin:\nno parts, no assemblies.\n\n00:01:54.239 --> 00:01:57.604\nIt's a system that gradually\nvaries its functionality\n\n00:01:57.628 --> 00:01:59.309\nby varying elasticity.\n\n00:01:59.793 --> 00:02:03.735\nSo here this is a split screen\nto represent my split world view,\n\n00:02:03.759 --> 00:02:08.163\nthe split personality of every designer\nand architect operating today\n\n00:02:08.187 --> 00:02:10.506\nbetween the chisel and the gene,\n\n00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:15.368\nbetween machine and organism,\nbetween assembly and growth,\n\n00:02:15.392 --> 00:02:17.930\nbetween Henry Ford and Charles Darwin.\n\n00:02:18.692 --> 00:02:21.694\nThese two worldviews,\nmy left brain and right brain,\n\n00:02:21.718 --> 00:02:28.363\nanalysis and synthesis, will play out\non the two screens behind me.\n\n00:02:29.712 --> 00:02:32.158\nMy work, at its simplest level,\n\n00:02:32.182 --> 00:02:34.917\nis about uniting these two worldviews,\n\n00:02:34.941 --> 00:02:37.155\nmoving away from assembly\n\n00:02:37.179 --> 00:02:40.217\nand closer into growth.\n\n00:02:41.057 --> 00:02:43.169\nYou're probably asking yourselves:\n\n00:02:43.193 --> 00:02:44.343\nWhy now?\n\n00:02:44.724 --> 00:02:48.505\nWhy was this not possible 10\nor even five years ago?\n\n00:02:50.409 --> 00:02:52.537\nWe live in a very special time in history,\n\n00:02:52.561 --> 00:02:54.633\na rare time,\n\n00:02:54.657 --> 00:02:59.236\na time when the confluence of four fields\nis giving designers access to tools\n\n00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:01.510\nwe've never had access to before.\n\n00:03:02.163 --> 00:03:05.027\nThese fields are computational design,\n\n00:03:05.051 --> 00:03:10.059\nallowing us to design\ncomplex forms with simple code;\n\n00:03:10.083 --> 00:03:14.117\nadditive manufacturing,\nletting us produce parts\n\n00:03:14.141 --> 00:03:17.767\nby adding material\nrather than carving it out;\n\n00:03:17.791 --> 00:03:21.235\nmaterials engineering, which lets us\ndesign the behavior of materials\n\n00:03:21.259 --> 00:03:22.976\nin high resolution;\n\n00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:24.857\nand synthetic biology,\n\n00:03:24.881 --> 00:03:28.957\nenabling us to design new biological\nfunctionality by editing DNA.\n\n00:03:29.449 --> 00:03:31.689\nAnd at the intersection\nof these four fields,\n\n00:03:31.713 --> 00:03:33.426\nmy team and I create.\n\n00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:35.855\nPlease meet the minds and hands\n\n00:03:35.879 --> 00:03:37.275\nof my students.\n\n00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:45.391\nWe design objects and products\nand structures and tools across scales,\n\n00:03:45.415 --> 00:03:47.186\nfrom the large-scale,\n\n00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:50.726\nlike this robotic arm\nwith an 80-foot diameter reach\n\n00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:54.884\nwith a vehicular base that will\none day soon print entire buildings,\n\n00:03:54.908 --> 00:03:58.995\nto nanoscale graphics made entirely\nof genetically engineered microorganisms\n\n00:03:59.019 --> 00:04:00.399\nthat glow in the dark.\n\n00:04:01.219 --> 00:04:03.403\nHere we've reimagined the mashrabiya,\n\n00:04:03.427 --> 00:04:06.800\nan archetype of ancient\nArabic architecture,\n\n00:04:06.824 --> 00:04:10.388\nand created a screen where\nevery aperture is uniquely sized\n\n00:04:10.412 --> 00:04:13.998\nto shape the form of light and heat\nmoving through it.\n\n00:04:14.957 --> 00:04:16.673\nIn our next project,\n\n00:04:16.697 --> 00:04:19.907\nwe explore the possibility\nof creating a cape and skirt --\n\n00:04:19.931 --> 00:04:23.121\nthis was for a Paris fashion show\nwith Iris van Herpen --\n\n00:04:23.145 --> 00:04:25.933\nlike a second skin\nthat are made of a single part,\n\n00:04:25.957 --> 00:04:29.007\nstiff at the contours,\nflexible around the waist.\n\n00:04:29.547 --> 00:04:33.747\nTogether with my long-term\n3D printing collaborator Stratasys,\n\n00:04:33.771 --> 00:04:38.778\nwe 3D-printed this cape and skirt\nwith no seams between the cells,\n\n00:04:38.802 --> 00:04:40.798\nand I'll show more objects like it.\n\n00:04:41.410 --> 00:04:44.823\nThis helmet combines\nstiff and soft materials\n\n00:04:44.847 --> 00:04:47.959\nin 20-micron resolution.\n\n00:04:47.983 --> 00:04:50.371\nThis is the resolution of a human hair.\n\n00:04:50.395 --> 00:04:52.981\nIt's also the resolution of a CT scanner.\n\n00:04:53.489 --> 00:04:55.030\nThat designers have access\n\n00:04:55.054 --> 00:04:59.452\nto such high-resolution\nanalytic and synthetic tools,\n\n00:04:59.476 --> 00:05:04.038\nenables to design products that fit\nnot only the shape of our bodies,\n\n00:05:04.062 --> 00:05:07.570\nbut also the physiological\nmakeup of our tissues.\n\n00:05:08.403 --> 00:05:10.411\nNext, we designed an acoustic chair,\n\n00:05:10.435 --> 00:05:13.647\na chair that would be at once\nstructural, comfortable\n\n00:05:13.671 --> 00:05:15.995\nand would also absorb sound.\n\n00:05:16.487 --> 00:05:20.933\nProfessor Carter, my collaborator, and I\nturned to nature for inspiration,\n\n00:05:20.957 --> 00:05:23.642\nand by designing this irregular\nsurface pattern,\n\n00:05:23.666 --> 00:05:26.037\nit becomes sound-absorbent.\n\n00:05:26.617 --> 00:05:30.517\nWe printed its surface\nout of 44 different properties,\n\n00:05:30.541 --> 00:05:33.934\nvarying in rigidity, opacity and color,\n\n00:05:33.958 --> 00:05:37.957\ncorresponding to pressure points\non the human body.\n\n00:05:37.981 --> 00:05:41.973\nIts surface, as in nature,\nvaries its functionality\n\n00:05:41.997 --> 00:05:45.624\nnot by adding another material\nor another assembly,\n\n00:05:45.648 --> 00:05:50.367\nbut by continuously and delicately\nvarying material property.\n\n00:05:52.454 --> 00:05:54.271\nBut is nature ideal?\n\n00:05:56.104 --> 00:05:58.246\nAre there no parts in nature?\n\n00:06:01.143 --> 00:06:04.414\nI wasn't raised\nin a religious Jewish home,\n\n00:06:04.438 --> 00:06:05.594\nbut when I was young,\n\n00:06:05.618 --> 00:06:09.015\nmy grandmother used to tell me\nstories from the Hebrew Bible,\n\n00:06:09.039 --> 00:06:13.044\nand one of them stuck with me and came\nto define much of what I care about.\n\n00:06:13.068 --> 00:06:15.076\nAs she recounts:\n\n00:06:15.100 --> 00:06:18.043\n\"On the third day of Creation,\nGod commands the Earth\n\n00:06:18.067 --> 00:06:20.583\nto grow a fruit-bearing fruit tree.\"\n\n00:06:20.607 --> 00:06:23.834\nFor this first fruit tree,\nthere was to be no differentiation\n\n00:06:23.858 --> 00:06:28.228\nbetween trunk, branches,\nleaves and fruit.\n\n00:06:28.252 --> 00:06:30.401\nThe whole tree was a fruit.\n\n00:06:32.187 --> 00:06:37.406\nInstead, the land grew trees\nthat have bark and stems and flowers.\n\n00:06:38.295 --> 00:06:41.668\nThe land created a world made of parts.\n\n00:06:42.472 --> 00:06:44.330\nI often ask myself,\n\n00:06:44.354 --> 00:06:48.647\n\"What would design be like\nif objects were made of a single part?\n\n00:06:49.370 --> 00:06:52.807\nWould we return to a better\nstate of creation?\"\n\n00:06:54.957 --> 00:06:56.912\nSo we looked for that biblical material,\n\n00:06:56.936 --> 00:07:01.589\nthat fruit-bearing fruit tree\nkind of material, and we found it.\n\n00:07:03.452 --> 00:07:07.208\nThe second-most abundant biopolymer\non the planet is called chitin,\n\n00:07:07.232 --> 00:07:10.933\nand some 100 million tons of it\nare produced every year\n\n00:07:10.957 --> 00:07:14.813\nby organisms such as shrimps,\ncrabs, scorpions and butterflies.\n\n00:07:15.217 --> 00:07:17.933\nWe thought if we could tune\nits properties,\n\n00:07:17.957 --> 00:07:20.585\nwe could generate structures\nthat are multifunctional\n\n00:07:20.609 --> 00:07:22.169\nout of a single part.\n\n00:07:22.193 --> 00:07:23.937\nSo that's what we did.\n\n00:07:24.957 --> 00:07:26.950\nWe called Legal Seafood --\n\n00:07:26.974 --> 00:07:28.010\n(Laughter)\n\n00:07:28.034 --> 00:07:30.891\nwe ordered a bunch of shrimp shells,\n\n00:07:30.915 --> 00:07:33.985\nwe grinded them\nand we produced chitosan paste.\n\n00:07:34.541 --> 00:07:36.505\nBy varying chemical concentrations,\n\n00:07:36.529 --> 00:07:39.823\nwe were able to achieve\na wide array of properties --\n\n00:07:39.847 --> 00:07:41.624\nfrom dark, stiff and opaque,\n\n00:07:41.648 --> 00:07:43.964\nto light, soft and transparent.\n\n00:07:44.647 --> 00:07:47.587\nIn order to print the structures\nin large scale,\n\n00:07:47.611 --> 00:07:52.038\nwe built a robotically controlled\nextrusion system with multiple nozzles.\n\n00:07:52.348 --> 00:07:55.506\nThe robot would vary\nmaterial properties on the fly\n\n00:07:55.530 --> 00:08:00.633\nand create these 12-foot-long structures\nmade of a single material,\n\n00:08:00.657 --> 00:08:03.399\n100 percent recyclable.\n\n00:08:03.423 --> 00:08:06.097\nWhen the parts are ready,\nthey're left to dry\n\n00:08:06.121 --> 00:08:09.700\nand find a form naturally\nupon contact with air.\n\n00:08:10.271 --> 00:08:14.200\nSo why are we still\ndesigning with plastics?\n\n00:08:15.957 --> 00:08:19.420\nThe air bubbles that were a byproduct\nof the printing process\n\n00:08:19.444 --> 00:08:22.320\nwere used to contain\nphotosynthetic microorganisms\n\n00:08:22.344 --> 00:08:25.217\nthat first appeared on our planet\n3.5 billion year ago,\n\n00:08:25.241 --> 00:08:26.803\nas we learned yesterday.\n\n00:08:27.957 --> 00:08:30.544\nTogether with our collaborators\nat Harvard and MIT,\n\n00:08:30.568 --> 00:08:33.321\nwe embedded bacteria\nthat were genetically engineered\n\n00:08:33.345 --> 00:08:36.487\nto rapidly capture carbon\nfrom the atmosphere\n\n00:08:36.511 --> 00:08:38.518\nand convert it into sugar.\n\n00:08:39.407 --> 00:08:41.194\nFor the first time,\n\n00:08:41.218 --> 00:08:45.184\nwe were able to generate structures\nthat would seamlessly transition\n\n00:08:45.208 --> 00:08:48.542\nfrom beam to mesh,\n\n00:08:48.566 --> 00:08:50.961\nand if scaled even larger, to windows.\n\n00:08:51.977 --> 00:08:53.533\nA fruit-bearing fruit tree.\n\n00:08:54.584 --> 00:08:57.270\nWorking with an ancient material,\n\n00:08:57.294 --> 00:08:59.933\none of the first lifeforms on the planet,\n\n00:08:59.957 --> 00:09:03.933\nplenty of water and a little bit\nof synthetic biology,\n\n00:09:03.957 --> 00:09:07.464\nwe were able to transform a structure\nmade of shrimp shells\n\n00:09:07.488 --> 00:09:11.055\ninto an architecture\nthat behaves like a tree.\n\n00:09:11.682 --> 00:09:13.983\nAnd here's the best part:\n\n00:09:14.007 --> 00:09:15.954\nfor objects designed to biodegrade,\n\n00:09:15.978 --> 00:09:18.889\nput them in the sea,\nand they will nourish marine life;\n\n00:09:19.698 --> 00:09:23.524\nplace them in soil,\nand they will help grow a tree.\n\n00:09:24.373 --> 00:09:28.390\nThe setting for our next exploration\nusing the same design principles\n\n00:09:28.414 --> 00:09:30.135\nwas the solar system.\n\n00:09:30.651 --> 00:09:34.933\nWe looked for the possibility\nof creating life-sustaining clothing\n\n00:09:34.957 --> 00:09:37.125\nfor interplanetary voyages.\n\n00:09:38.665 --> 00:09:43.703\nTo do that, we needed to contain bacteria\nand be able to control their flow.\n\n00:09:43.727 --> 00:09:48.287\nSo like the periodic table, we came up\nwith our own table of the elements:\n\n00:09:48.311 --> 00:09:51.700\nnew lifeforms that\nwere computationally grown,\n\n00:09:51.724 --> 00:09:53.765\nadditively manufactured\n\n00:09:53.789 --> 00:09:56.237\nand biologically augmented.\n\n00:09:58.054 --> 00:10:01.579\nI like to think of synthetic biology\nas liquid alchemy,\n\n00:10:01.603 --> 00:10:04.342\nonly instead of transmuting\nprecious metals,\n\n00:10:04.366 --> 00:10:08.105\nyou're synthesizing new biological\nfunctionality inside very small channels.\n\n00:10:08.129 --> 00:10:10.477\nIt's called microfluidics.\n\n00:10:11.025 --> 00:10:15.200\nWe 3D-printed our own channels\nin order to control the flow\n\n00:10:15.224 --> 00:10:17.588\nof these liquid bacterial cultures.\n\n00:10:19.390 --> 00:10:23.391\nIn our first piece of clothing,\nwe combined two microorganisms.\n\n00:10:23.415 --> 00:10:25.326\nThe first is cyanobacteria.\n\n00:10:25.350 --> 00:10:28.326\nIt lives in our oceans\nand in freshwater ponds.\n\n00:10:28.350 --> 00:10:32.273\nAnd the second, E. coli, the bacterium\nthat inhabits the human gut.\n\n00:10:32.820 --> 00:10:36.393\nOne converts light into sugar,\nthe other consumes that sugar\n\n00:10:36.417 --> 00:10:39.766\nand produces biofuels\nuseful for the built environment.\n\n00:10:39.790 --> 00:10:44.277\nNow, these two microorganisms\nnever interact in nature.\n\n00:10:44.301 --> 00:10:46.159\nIn fact, they never met each other.\n\n00:10:46.183 --> 00:10:49.362\nThey've been here,\nengineered for the first time,\n\n00:10:49.386 -->

by design.\n\n00:10:59.473 --> 00:11:01.672\nIn order to contain these relationships,\n\n00:11:01.696 --> 00:11:05.801\nwe've created a single channel\nthat resembles the digestive

human body,\n\n00:11:14.433 --> 00:11:17.762\nvarying material properties\naccording to the desired functionality.\n\n00:11:17.786 --> 00:11:22.316\nWhere we wanted more photosynthesis,\nwe would design more transparent channels.\n\n00:11:23.059 --> 00:11:28.163\nThis wearable digestive system,\nwhen it's stretched end to end,\n\n00:11:28.187 --> 00:11:30.251\nspans 60 meters.\n\n00:11:30.275

made up.\"\n\n00:11:55.829 --> 00:11:59.710\nWhat if design could provide\nthat other half?\n\n00:11:59.734 --> 00:12:04.541\nWhat if we could create structures\nthat would augment living matter?\n\n00:12:05.993 --> 00:12:09.426\nWhat if we could create\npersonal microbiomes\n\n00:12:09.450 --> 00:12:13.325\nthat would scan our skins,\nrepair damaged tissue\n\n00:12:13.349 --> 00:12:15.078\nand sustain our bodies?\n\n00:12:16.020 --> 00:12:18.933\nThink of this as a form of edited biology.\n\n00:12:18.957 --> 00:12:22.933\nThis entire collection, Wanderers,\nthat was named after planets,\n\n00:12:22.957 --> 00:12:25.615\nwas not to me really about fashion per se,\n\n00:12:25.639 --> 00:12:28.998\nbut it provided an opportunity\nto speculate about the future\n\n00:12:29.022 --> 00:12:31.644\nof our race on our planet and beyond,\n\n00:12:31.668 --> 00:12:35.399\nto combine scientific insight\nwith lots of mystery\n\n00:12:35.423 --> 00:12:38.744\nand to move away\nfrom the age of the machine\n\n00:12:38.768 --> 00:12:42.244\nto a new age of symbiosis\nbetween our bodies,\n\n00:12:42.268 --> 00:12:44.707\nthe microorganisms that we inhabit,\n\n00:12:44.731 --> 00:12:46.659\nour products and even our buildings.\n\n00:12:46.683 --> 00:12:49.525\nI call this material ecology.\n\n00:12:49.549 --> 00:12:54.126\nTo do this, we always need\nto return back to nature.\n\n00:12:54.957 --> 00:12:58.955\nBy now, you know that a 3D printer\nprints material in layers.\n\n00:12:59.717 --> 00:13:01.629\nYou also know that nature doesn't.\n\n00:13:02.140 --> 00:13:05.640\nIt grows. It adds with sophistication.\n\n00:13:06.060 --> 00:13:08.624\nThis silkworm cocoon, for example,\n\n00:13:08.648 --> 00:13:11.968\ncreates a highly\nsophisticated architecture,\n\n00:13:11.992 --> 00:13:14.793\na home inside which to metamorphisize.\n\n00:13:14.817 --> 00:13:20.469\nNo additive manufacturing today gets even\nclose to this level of sophistication.\n\n00:13:20.493 --> 00:13:23.565\nIt does so by combining not two materials,\n\n00:13:23.589 --> 00:13:26.898\nbut two proteins\nin different concentrations.\n\n00:13:27.445 --> 00:13:31.441\nOne acts as the structure,\nthe other is the glue, or the matrix,\n\n00:13:31.465 --> 00:13:33.886\nholding those fibers together.\n\n00:13:33.910 --> 00:13:35.670\nAnd this happens across scales.\n\n00:13:36.675 --> 00:13:39.407\nThe silkworm first attaches itself\nto the environment --\n\n00:13:39.431 --> 00:13:41.447\nit creates a tensile structure --\n\n00:13:41.471 --> 00:13:44.568\nand it then starts spinning\na compressive cocoon.\n\n00:13:44.957 --> 00:13:48.488\nTension and compression,\nthe two forces of life,\n\n00:13:48.512 --> 00:13:51.566\nmanifested in a single material.\n\n00:13:53.295 --> 00:13:56.506\nIn order to better understand\nhow this complex process works,\n\n00:13:56.530 --> 00:13:58.717\nwe glued a tiny earth magnet\n\n00:13:58.741 --> 00:14:01.740\nto the head of a silkworm,\nto the spinneret.\n\n00:14:01.764 --> 00:14:04.712\nWe placed it inside a box\nwith magnetic sensors,\n\n00:14:04.736 --> 00:14:07.823\nand that allowed us to create\nthis 3-dimensional point cloud\n\n00:14:07.847 --> 00:14:12.789\nand visualize the complex architecture\nof the silkworm cocoon.\n\n00:14:13.694 --> 00:14:17.348\nHowever, when we placed\nthe silkworm on a flat patch,\n\n00:14:17.372 --> 00:14:19.110\nnot inside a box,\n\n00:14:19.134 --> 00:14:22.325\nwe realized it would spin a flat cocoon\n\n00:14:22.349 --> 00:14:25.326\nand it would still\nhealthily metamorphisize.\n\n00:14:25.739 --> 00:14:29.724\nSo we started designing different\nenvironments, different scaffolds,\n\n00:14:29.748 --> 00:14:32.483\nand we discovered that\nthe shape, the composition,\n\n00:14:32.507 --> 00:14:36.220\nthe structure of the cocoon, was directly\ninformed by the environment.\n\n00:14:36.824 --> 00:14:41.177\nSilkworms are often boiled to death\ninside their cocoons,\n\n00:14:41.201 --> 00:14:44.383\ntheir silk unraveled and used\nin the textile industry.\n\n00:14:44.891 --> 00:14:51.350\nWe realized that designing these templates\nallowed us to give shape to raw silk\n\n00:14:51.374 --> 00:14:54.444\nwithout boiling a single cocoon.\n\n00:14:54.908 --> 00:14:58.151\n(Applause)\n\n00:14:58.175 --> 00:15:00.897\nThey would healthily metamorphisize,\n\n00:15:00.921 --> 00:15:03.451\nand we would be able\nto create these things.\n\n00:15:03.475 --> 00:15:06.582\nSo we scaled this process up\nto architectural scale.\n\n00:15:07.128 --> 00:15:10.259\nWe had a robot spin\nthe template out of silk,\n\n00:15:10.283 --> 00:15:11.963\nand we placed it on our site.\n\n00:15:12.447 --> 00:15:17.331\nWe knew silkworms migrated\ntoward darker and colder areas,\n\n00:15:17.355 --> 00:15:20.675\nso we used a sun path diagram\nto reveal the distribution\n\n00:15:20.699 --> 00:15:22.848\nof light and heat on our structure.\n\n00:15:23.650 --> 00:15:26.160\nWe then created holes, or apertures,\n\n00:15:26.184 --> 00:15:29.933\nthat would lock in the rays\nof light and heat,\n\n00:15:29.957 --> 00:15:33.672\ndistributing those silkworms\non the structure.\n\n00:15:34.735 --> 00:15:37.108\nWe were ready to receive the caterpillars.\n\n00:15:37.132 --> 00:15:40.851\nWe ordered 6,500 silkworms\nfrom an online silk farm.\n\n00:15:41.989 --> 00:15:45.917\nAnd after four weeks of feeding,\nthey were ready to spin with us.\n\n00:15:45.941 --> 00:15:49.473\nWe placed them carefully\nat the bottom rim of the scaffold,\n\n00:15:49.497 --> 00:15:53.933\nand as they spin they pupate,\nthey mate, they lay eggs,\n\n00:15:53.957 --> 00:15:59.062\nand life begins all over again --\njust like us but much, much shorter.\n\n00:16:00.258 --> 00:16:05.003\nBucky Fuller said that tension\nis the great integrity,\n\n00:16:05.027 --> 00:16:06.650\nand he was right.\n\n00:16:06.674 --> 00:16:10.396\nAs they spin biological silk\nover robotically spun silk,\n\n00:16:10.420 --> 00:16:13.084\nthey give this entire\npavilion its integrity.\n\n00:16:13.108 --> 00:16:14.958\nAnd over two to three weeks,\n\n00:16:14.982 --> 00:16:19.637\n6,500 silkworms spin 6,500 kilometers.\n\n00:16:19.661 --> 00:16:23.334\nIn a curious symmetry, this is also\nthe length of the Silk Road.\n\n00:16:24.795 --> 00:16:28.650\nThe moths, after they hatch,\nproduce 1.5 million eggs.\n\n00:16:28.674 --> 00:16:32.788\nThis could be used for 250\nadditional pavilions for the future.\n\n00:16:33.597 --> 00:16:36.662\nSo here they are, the two worldviews.\n\n00:16:36.686 --> 00:16:40.453\nOne spins silk out of a robotic arm,\n\n00:16:40.477 --> 00:16:42.809\nthe other fills in the gaps.\n\n00:16:44.140 --> 00:16:47.921\nIf the final frontier of design\nis to breathe life into the products\n\n00:16:47.945 --> 00:16:49.739\nand the buildings around us,\n\n00:16:49.763 --> 00:16:51.933\nto form a two-material ecology,\n\n00:16:51.957 --> 00:16:55.561\nthen designers must unite\nthese two worldviews.\n\n00:16:55.585 --> 00:16:59.362\nWhich brings us back, of course,\nto the beginning.\n\n00:17:00.079 --> 00:17:03.682\nHere's to a new age of design,\na new age of creation,\n\n00:17:03.706 --> 00:17:07.054\nthat takes us from\na nature-inspired design\n\n00:17:07.078 --> 00:17:09.933\nto a design-inspired nature,\n\n00:17:09.957 --> 00:17:13.933\nand that demands of us for the first time\n\n00:17:13.957 --> 00:17:18.100\nthat we mother nature.\n\n00:17:18.751 --> 00:17:19.785\nThank you.\n\n00:17:19.809 --> 00:17:26.805\n(Applause)\n\n00:17:26.829 --> 00:17:28.933\nThank you very much.

Here's how", "duration": "664", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/sandrine_thuret_you_can_grow_new_brain_cells_here_s_how", "transcript": "Can we, as adults, grow new nerve cells? There's still some confusion about that question, as this is a fairly new field of research. For example, I was talking to one of my colleagues, Robert, who is an oncologist, and he was telling me, \"Sandrine, this is puzzling. Some of my patients that have been told they are cured of their cancer still develop symptoms of depression.\" And I responded to him, \"Well, from my point of view that makes sense. The drug you give to your patients that stops the cancer cells multiplying also stops the newborn neurons being generated in their brain.\" And then Robert looked at me like I was crazy and said, \"But Sandrine, these are adult patients \u2014 adults do not grow new nerve cells.\" And much to his surprise, I said, \"Well actually, we do.\" And this is a phenomenon that we call neurogenesis.[Neurogenesis]Now Robert is not a neuroscientist, and when he went to medical school he was not taught what we know now \u2014 that the adult brain can generate new nerve cells. So Robert, you know, being the good doctor that he is, wanted to come to my lab to understand the topic a little bit better. And I took him for a tour of one of the most exciting parts of the brain when it comes to neurogenesis \u2014 and this is the hippocampus. So this is this gray structure in the center of the brain. And what we've known already for very long, is that this is important for learning, memory, mood and emotion. However, what we have learned more recently is that this is one of the unique structures of the adult brain where new neurons can be generated. And if we slice through the hippocampus and zoom in, what you actually see here in blue is a newborn neuron in an adult mouse brain. So when it comes to the human brain \u2014 my colleague Jonas Fris\u00e9n from the Karolinska Institutet, has estimated that we produce 700 new neurons per day in the hippocampus. You might think this is not much, compared to the billions of neurons we have. But by the time we turn 50, we will have all exchanged the neurons we were born with in that structure with adult-born neurons.So why are these new neurons important and what are their functions? First, we know that they're important for learning and memory. And in the lab we have shown that if we block the ability of the adult brain to produce new neurons in the hippocampus, then we block certain memory abilities. And this is especially new and true for spatial recognition \u2014 so like, how you navigate your way in the city.We are still learning a lot, and neurons are not only important for memory capacity, but also for the quality of the memory. And they will have been helpful to add time to our memory and they will help differentiate very similar memories, like: how do you find your bike that you park at the station every day in the same area, but in a slightly different position?And more interesting to my colleague Robert is the research we have been doing on neurogenesis and depression. So in an animal model of depression, we have seen that we have a lower level of neurogenesis. And if we give antidepressants, then we increase the production of these newborn neurons, and we decrease the symptoms of depression, establishing a clear link between neurogenesis and depression. But moreover, if you just block neurogenesis, then you block the efficacy of the antidepressant. So by then, Robert had understood that very likely his patients were suffering from depression even after being cured of their cancer, because the cancer drug had stopped newborn neurons from being generated. And it will take time to generate new neurons that reach normal functions.So, collectively, now we think we have enough evidence to say that neurogenesis is a target of choice if we want to improve memory formation or mood, or even prevent the decline associated with aging, or associated with stress.So the next question is: can we control neurogenesis? The answer is yes. And we are now going to do a little quiz. I'm going to give you a set of behaviors and activities, and you tell me if you think they will increase neurogenesis or if they will decrease neurogenesis. Are we ready? OK, let's go.So what about learning? Increasing? Yes. Learning will increase the production of these new neurons.How about stress? Yes, stress will decrease the production of new neurons in the hippocampus.How about sleep deprivation? Indeed, it will decrease neurogenesis.How about sex? Oh, wow!(Laughter)Yes, you are right, it will increase the production of new neurons. However, it's all about balance here. We don't want to fall in a situation \u2014(Laughter)about too much sex leading to sleep deprivation.(Laughter)How about getting older? So the neurogenesis rate will decrease as we get older, but it is still occurring.And then finally, how about running? I will let you judge that one by yourself.So this is one of the first studies that was carried out by one of my mentors, Rusty Gage from the Salk Institute, showing that the environment can have an impact on the production of new neurons. And here you see a section of the hippocampus of a mouse that had no running wheel in its cage. And the little black dots you see are actually newborn neurons-to-be. And now, you see a section of the hippocampus of a mouse that had a running wheel in its cage. So you see the massive increase of the black dots representing the new neurons-to-be.So activity impacts neurogenesis, but that's not all. What you eat will have an effect on the production of new neurons in the hippocampus. So here we have a sample of diet \u2014 of nutrients that have been shown to have efficacy. And I'm just going to point a few out to you: Calorie restriction of 20 to 30 percent will increase neurogenesis. Intermittent fasting \u2014 spacing the time between your meals \u2014 will increase neurogenesis. Intake of flavonoids, which are contained in dark chocolate or blueberries, will increase neurogenesis. Omega-3 fatty acids, present in fatty fish, like salmon, will increase the production of these new neurons. Conversely, a diet rich in high saturated fat will have a negative impact on neurogenesis. Ethanol \u2014 intake of alcohol \u2014 will decrease neurogenesis. However, not everything is lost; resveratrol, which is contained in red wine, has been shown to promote the survival of these new neurons. So next time you are at a dinner party, you might want to reach for this possibly \"neurogenesis-neutral\" drink.(Laughter)And then finally, let me point out the last one \u2014 a quirky one. So Japanese groups are fascinated with food textures, and they have shown that actually soft diet impairs neurogenesis, as opposed to food that requires mastication \u2014 chewing \u2014 or crunchy food.So all of this data, where we need to look at the cellular level, has been generated using animal models. But this diet has also been given to human participants, and what we could see is that the diet modulates memory and mood in the same direction as it modulates neurogenesis, such as: calorie restriction will improve memory capacity, whereas a high-fat diet will exacerbate symptoms of depression \u2014 as opposed to omega-3 fatty acids, which increase neurogenesis, and also help to decrease the symptoms of depression. So we think that the effect of diet on mental health, on memory and mood, is actually mediated by the production of the new neurons in the hippocampus. And it's not only what you eat, but it's also the texture of the food, when you eat it and how much of it you eat.On our side \u2014 neuroscientists interested in neurogenesis \u2014 we need to understand better the function of these new neurons, and how we can control their survival and their production. We also need to find a way to protect the neurogenesis of Robert's patients. And on your side \u2014 I leave you in charge of your neurogenesis.Thank you.(Applause)Margaret Heffernan: Fantastic research, Sandrine. Now, I told you you changed my life \u2014 I now eat a lot of blueberries.Sandrine Thuret: Very good.MH: I'm really interested in the running thing. Do I have to run? Or is it really just about aerobic exercise, getting oxygen to the brain? Could it be any kind of vigorous exercise?ST: So for the moment, we can't really say if it's just the running itself, but we think that anything that indeed will increase the production \u2014 or moving the blood flow to the brain, should be beneficial.MH: So I don't have to get a running wheel in my office?ST: No, you don't!MH: Oh, what a relief! That's wonderful.

--> 00:01:46.228\nwhen it comes to neurogenesis --\n\n00:01:46.252 --> 00:01:48.340\nand this is the hippocampus.\n\n00:01:49.038 --> 00:01:52.890\nSo this is this gray structure\nin the center of the brain.\n\n00:01:53.571 --> 00:01:55.993\nAnd what we've known already\nfor very long,\n\n00:01:56.017 --> 00:02:00.782\nis that this is important for learning,\nmemory, mood and emotion.\n\n00:02:01.301 --> 00:02:04.348\nHowever, what we\nhave learned more recently\n\n00:02:04.372 --> 00:02:09.030\nis that this is one of the unique\nstructures of the adult brain\n\n00:02:09.054 --> 00:02:11.704\nwhere new neurons can be generated.\n\n00:02:12.363 --> 00:02:14.674\nAnd if we slice through the hippocampus\n\n00:02:14.698 --> 00:02:15.966\nand zoom in,\n\n00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:18.791\nwhat you actually see here in blue\n\n00:02:18.815 --> 00:02:23.388\nis a newborn neuron\nin an adult mouse brain.\n\n00:02:24.727 --> 00:02:27.782\nSo when it comes to the human brain --\n\n00:02:27.806 --> 00:02:31.338\nmy colleague Jonas Fris\u00e9n\nfrom the Karolinska Institutet,\n\n00:02:31.362 --> 00:02:37.102\nhas estimated that we produce\n700 new neurons per day\n\n00:02:37.126 --> 00:02:38.324\nin the hippocampus.\n\n00:02:39.141 --> 00:02:40.816\nYou might think this is not much,\n\n00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:43.229\ncompared to the billions\nof neurons we have.\n\n00:02:43.602 --> 00:02:46.673\nBut by the time we turn 50,\n\n00:02:46.697 --> 00:02:51.373\nwe will have all exchanged the neurons\nwe were born with in that structure\n\n00:02:51.397 --> 00:02:53.612\nwith adult-born neurons.\n\n00:02:55.206 --> 00:03:00.242\nSo why are these new neurons important\nand what are their functions?\n\n00:03:01.282 --> 00:03:04.980\nFirst, we know that they're important\nfor learning and memory.\n\n00:03:05.004 --> 00:03:06.521\nAnd in the lab we have shown\n\n00:03:06.545 --> 00:03:09.781\nthat if we block the ability\nof the adult brain\n\n00:03:09.805 --> 00:03:12.365\nto produce new neurons in the hippocampus,\n\n00:03:12.389 --> 00:03:14.905\nthen we block certain memory abilities.\n\n00:03:15.679 --> 00:03:22.591\nAnd this is especially new and true\nfor spatial recognition --\n\n00:03:22.615 --> 00:03:25.413\nso like, how you navigate\nyour way in the city.\n\n00:03:26.139 --> 00:03:27.617\nWe are still learning a lot,\n\n00:03:27.641 --> 00:03:30.704\nand neurons are not only important\nfor memory capacity,\n\n00:03:30.728 --> 00:03:33.631\nbut also for the quality of the memory.\n\n00:03:33.655 --> 00:03:37.700\nAnd they will have been helpful\nto add time to our memory\n\n00:03:37.724 --> 00:03:42.406\nand they will help differentiate\nvery similar memories, like:\n\n00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:44.510\nhow do you find your bike\n\n00:03:44.534 --> 00:03:48.050\nthat you park at the station\nevery day in the same area,\n\n00:03:48.074 --> 00:03:50.216\nbut in a slightly different position?\n\n00:03:52.026 --> 00:03:54.510\nAnd more interesting\nto my colleague Robert\n\n00:03:54.534 --> 00:03:59.396\nis the research we have been doing\non neurogenesis and depression.\n\n00:03:59.968 --> 00:04:01.906\nSo in an animal model of depression,\n\n00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:05.934\nwe have seen that we have\na lower level of neurogenesis.\n\n00:04:06.458 --> 00:04:08.701\nAnd if we give antidepressants,\n\n00:04:08.725 --> 00:04:12.179\nthen we increase the production\nof these newborn neurons,\n\n00:04:12.203 --> 00:04:15.346\nand we decrease\nthe symptoms of depression,\n\n00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:20.830\nestablishing a clear link\nbetween neurogenesis and depression.\n\n00:04:21.149 --> 00:04:25.458\nBut moreover, if you\njust block neurogenesis,\n\n00:04:25.482 --> 00:04:28.315\nthen you block the efficacy\nof the antidepressant.\n\n00:04:29.672 --> 00:04:31.435\nSo by then, Robert had understood\n\n00:04:31.459 --> 00:04:35.157\nthat very likely his patients\nwere suffering from depression\n\n00:04:35.181 --> 00:04:37.776\neven after being cured of their cancer,\n\n00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:42.181\nbecause the cancer drug had stopped\nnewborn neurons from being generated.\n\n00:04:42.205 --> 00:04:45.833\nAnd it will take time\nto generate new neurons\n\n00:04:45.857 --> 00:04:48.063\nthat reach normal functions.\n\n00:04:49.738 --> 00:04:54.147\nSo, collectively, now we think\nwe have enough evidence\n\n00:04:54.171 --> 00:04:57.886\nto say that neurogenesis\nis a target of choice\n\n00:04:57.910 --> 00:05:01.524\nif we want to improve\nmemory formation or mood,\n\n00:05:01.548 --> 00:05:05.111\nor even prevent the decline\nassociated with aging,\n\n00:05:05.135 --> 00:05:07.269\nor associated with stress.\n\n00:05:08.246 --> 00:05:09.977\nSo the next question is:\n\n00:05:10.001 --> 00:05:12.175\ncan we control neurogenesis?\n\n00:05:13.024 --> 00:05:14.215\nThe answer is yes.\n\n00:05:14.818 --> 00:05:17.381\nAnd we are now going to do a little quiz.\n\n00:05:18.159 --> 00:05:21.340\nI'm going to give you a set\nof behaviors and activities,\n\n00:05:21.364 --> 00:05:26.048\nand you tell me if you think\nthey will increase neurogenesis\n\n00:05:26.072 --> 00:05:28.238\nor if they will decrease neurogenesis.\n\n00:05:28.762 --> 00:05:29.921\nAre we ready?\n\n00:05:30.508 --> 00:05:31.667\nOK, let's go.\n\n00:05:31.992 --> 00:05:33.579\nSo what about learning?\n\n00:05:34.479 --> 00:05:35.659\nIncreasing?\n\n00:05:35.683 --> 00:05:36.842\nYes.\n\n00:05:36.866 --> 00:05:40.652\nLearning will increase the production\nof these new neurons.\n\n00:05:40.676 --> 00:05:41.992\nHow about stress?\n\n00:05:43.389 --> 00:05:48.126\nYes, stress will decrease the production\nof new neurons in the hippocampus.\n\n00:05:48.150 --> 00:05:49.762\nHow about sleep deprivation?\n\n00:05:51.333 --> 00:05:54.032\nIndeed, it will decrease neurogenesis.\n\n00:05:54.056 --> 00:05:55.277\nHow about sex?\n\n00:05:56.372 --> 00:05:57.524\nOh, wow!\n\n00:05:57.548 --> 00:05:58.815\n(Laughter)\n\n00:05:58.839 --> 00:06:02.592\nYes, you are right, it will increase\nthe production of new neurons.\n\n00:06:02.616 --> 00:06:04.768\nHowever, it's all about balance here.\n\n00:06:04.792 --> 00:06:07.005\nWe don't want to fall in a situation --\n\n00:06:07.029 --> 00:06:08.957\n(Laughter)\n\n00:06:08.981 --> 00:06:11.815\nabout too much sex\nleading to sleep deprivation.\n\n00:06:11.839 --> 00:06:14.068\n(Laughter)\n\n00:06:14.711 --> 00:06:16.902\nHow about getting older?\n\n00:06:19.603 --> 00:06:23.286\nSo the neurogenesis rate\nwill decrease as we get older,\n\n00:06:23.310 --> 00:06:25.056\nbut it is still occurring.\n\n00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:28.191\nAnd then finally, how about running?\n\n00:06:29.870 --> 00:06:32.679\nI will let you judge that one by yourself.\n\n00:06:33.521 --> 00:06:35.317\nSo this is one of the first studies\n\n00:06:35.341 --> 00:06:39.744\nthat was carried out by one of my mentors,\nRusty Gage from the Salk Institute,\n\n00:06:39.768 --> 00:06:42.042\nshowing that the environment\ncan have an impact\n\n00:06:42.066 --> 00:06:43.955\non the production of new neurons.\n\n00:06:43.979 --> 00:06:48.233\nAnd here you see a section\nof the hippocampus of a mouse\n\n00:06:48.257 --> 00:06:50.502\nthat had no running wheel in its cage.\n\n00:06:50.526 --> 00:06:54.561\nAnd the little black dots you see\nare actually newborn neurons-to-be.\n\n00:06:55.204 --> 00:07:00.342\nAnd now, you see a section\nof the hippocampus of a mouse\n\n00:07:00.366 --> 00:07:02.962\nthat had a running wheel in its cage.\n\n00:07:02.986 --> 00:07:04.509\nSo you see the massive increase\n\n00:07:04.533 --> 00:07:07.346\nof the black dots representing\nthe new neurons-to-be.\n\n00:07:08.777 --> 00:07:12.570\nSo activity impacts neurogenesis,\nbut that's not all.\n\n00:07:13.597 --> 00:07:16.244\nWhat you eat will have an effect\n\n00:07:16.268 --> 00:07:19.182\non the production of new neurons\nin the hippocampus.\n\n00:07:19.206 --> 00:07:22.166\nSo here we have a sample of diet --\n\n00:07:22.190 --> 00:07:25.467\nof nutrients that have been shown\nto have efficacy.\n\n00:07:25.931 --> 00:07:28.526\nAnd I'm just going\nto point a few out to you:\n\n00:07:28.550 --> 00:07:33.644\nCalorie restriction of 20 to 30 percent\nwill increase neurogenesis.\n\n00:07:34.086 --> 00:07:37.568\nIntermittent fasting --\nspacing the time between your meals --\n\n00:07:37.592 --> 00:07:39.731\nwill increase neurogenesis.\n\n00:07:39.755 --> 00:07:41.078\nIntake of flavonoids,\n\n00:07:41.102 --> 00:07:44.105\nwhich are contained\nin dark chocolate or blueberries,\n\n00:07:44.129 --> 00:07:45.952\nwill increase neurogenesis.\n\n00:07:46.313 --> 00:07:47.819\nOmega-3 fatty acids,\n\n00:07:47.843 --> 00:07:50.054\npresent in fatty fish, like salmon,\n\n00:07:50.078 --> 00:07:52.516\nwill increase the production\nof these new neurons.\n\n00:07:53.460 --> 00:07:57.561\nConversely, a diet rich\nin high saturated fat\n\n00:07:57.585 --> 00:08:00.325\nwill have a negative impact\non neurogenesis.\n\n00:08:01.190 --> 00:08:05.372\nEthanol -- intake of alcohol --\nwill decrease neurogenesis.\n\n00:08:05.939 --> 00:08:08.661\nHowever, not everything is lost;\n\n00:08:08.685 --> 00:08:11.737\nresveratrol, which is\ncontained in red wine,\n\n00:08:11.761 --> 00:08:15.252\nhas been shown to promote\nthe survival of these new neurons.\n\n00:08:15.666 --> 00:08:17.532\nSo next time you are at a dinner party,\n\n00:08:17.556 --> 00:08:21.560\nyou might want to reach for this possibly\n\"neurogenesis-neutral\" drink.\n\n00:08:21.867 --> 00:08:24.000\n(Laughter)\n\n00:08:24.024 --> 00:08:26.525\nAnd then finally,\nlet me point out the last one --\n\n00:08:26.549 --> 00:08:27.707\na quirky one.\n\n00:08:27.731 --> 00:08:31.626\nSo Japanese groups are fascinated\nwith food textures,\n\n00:08:31.650 --> 00:08:36.953\nand they have shown that actually\nsoft diet impairs neurogenesis,\n\n00:08:36.977 --> 00:08:41.698\nas opposed to food that requires\nmastication -- chewing -- or crunchy food.\n\n00:08:42.785 --> 00:08:44.578\nSo all of this data,\n\n00:08:44.602 --> 00:08:47.183\nwhere we need to look\nat the cellular level,\n\n00:08:47.207 --> 00:08:49.714\nhas been generated using animal models.\n\n00:08:50.428 --> 00:08:54.809\nBut this diet has also been given\nto human participants,\n\n00:08:54.833 --> 00:09:00.991\nand what we could see is that\nthe diet modulates memory and mood\n\n00:09:01.015 --> 00:09:04.499\nin the same direction\nas it modulates neurogenesis,\n\n00:09:04.523 --> 00:09:09.280\nsuch as: calorie restriction\nwill improve memory capacity,\n\n00:09:09.304 --> 00:09:14.403\nwhereas a high-fat diet will exacerbate\nsymptoms of depression --\n\n00:09:14.427 --> 00:09:18.291\nas opposed to omega-3 fatty acids,\nwhich increase neurogenesis,\n\n00:09:18.315 --> 00:09:22.498\nand also help to decrease\nthe symptoms of depression.\n\n00:09:23.601 --> 00:09:28.418\nSo we think that the effect of diet\n\n00:09:28.442 --> 00:09:32.037\non mental health, on memory and mood,\n\n00:09:32.061 --> 00:09:36.533\nis actually mediated by the production\nof the new neurons in the hippocampus.\n\n00:09:36.952 --> 00:09:38.872\nAnd it's not only what you eat,\n\n00:09:38.896 --> 00:09:41.961\nbut it's also the texture\nof the food, when you eat it\n\n00:09:41.985 --> 00:09:43.809\nand how much of it you eat.\n\n00:09:45.799 --> 00:09:49.832\nOn our side -- neuroscientists\ninterested in neurogenesis --\n\n00:09:49.856 --> 00:09:53.521\nwe need to understand better\nthe function of these new neurons,\n\n00:09:53.545 --> 00:09:57.529\nand how we can control their survival\nand their production.\n\n00:09:57.854 --> 00:10:02.393\nWe also need to find a way to protect\nthe neurogenesis of Robert's patients.\n\n00:10:03.229 --> 00:10:04.606\nAnd on your side --\n\n00:10:04.630 --> 00:10:07.060\nI leave you in charge\nof your neurogenesis.\n\n00:10:07.649 --> 00:10:08.807\nThank you.\n\n00:10:08.831 --> 00:10:14.790\n(Applause)\n\n00:10:14.814 --> 00:10:17.146\nMargaret Heffernan:\nFantastic research, Sandrine.\n\n00:10:17.170 --> 00:10:19.415\nNow, I told you you changed my life --\n\n00:10:19.439 --> 00:10:21.217\nI now eat a lot of blueberries.\n\n00:10:21.241 --> 00:10:22.788\nSandrine Thuret: Very good.\n\n00:10:23.486 --> 00:10:25.930\nMH: I'm really interested\nin the running thing.\n\n00:10:26.827 --> 00:10:28.478\nDo I have to run?\n\n00:10:29.326 --> 00:10:31.968\nOr is it really just\nabout aerobic exercise,\n\n00:10:31.992 --> 00:10:33.597\ngetting oxygen to the brain?\n\n00:10:33.621 --> 00:10:35.756\nCould it be any kind of vigorous exercise?\n\n00:10:36.059 --> 00:10:37.796\nST: So for the moment,\n\n00:10:37.820 --> 00:10:41.060\nwe can't really say\nif it's just the running itself,\n\n00:10:41.084 --> 00:10:46.121\nbut we think that anything that indeed\nwill increase the production --\n\n00:10:46.145 --> 00:10:49.225\nor moving the blood flow to the brain,\n\n00:10:49.249 --> 00:10:50.851\nshould be beneficial.\n\n00:10:51.311 --> 00:10:53.938\nMH: So I don't have to get\na running wheel in my office?\n\n00:10:53.962 --> 00:10:55.125\nST: No, you don't!\n\n00:10:55.149 --> 00:10:57.242\nMH: Oh, what a relief! That's wonderful.\n\n00:10:57.266 --> 00:10:59.019\nSandrine Thuret, thank you so much.\n\n00:10:59.043 --> 00:11:00.242\nST: Thank you, Margaret.\n\n00:11:00.266 --> 00:11:02.934\n(Applause)"}, {"title": "Home is a song I've always remembered", "duration": "649", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/teitur_home_is_a_song_i_ve_always_remembered", "transcript": "(Guitar music)I was just thinking that I have been missing you way too longThere's something inside this weary headthat wants us to love just insteadBut I was just thinking, merely thinkingI've got loads of pictures,I've got the one of you in that dancing dressBut man I feel silly in that dim lightJust after doing you by the sight of my Kodak delights,I am sinking, merely sinkingI think about long distance rates instead of kissing you babeI'm a singer without a songIf I wait for you longermy affection is strongerand I ...

In the next decade? Can we end hunger, achieve gender equality, halt climate change, all in the next 15 years?Well, according to the governments of the world, yes we can. In the last few days, the leaders of the world, meeting at the UN in New York, agreed a new set of Global Goals for the development of the world to 2030. And here they are: these goals are the product of a massive consultation exercise. The Global Goals are who we, humanity, want to be.Now that's the plan, but can we get there? Can this vision for a better world really be achieved? Well, I'm here today because we've run the numbers, and the answer, shockingly, is that maybe we actually can. But not with business as usual.Now, the idea that the world is going to get a better place may seem a little fanciful. Watch the news every day and the world seems to be going backwards, not forwards. And let's be frank: it's pretty easy to be skeptical about grand announcements coming out of the UN.But please, I invite you to suspend your disbelief for just a moment. Because back in 2001, the UN agreed another set of goals, the Millennium Development Goals. And the flagship target there was to halve the proportion of people living in poverty by 2015. The target was to take from a baseline of 1990, when 36 percent of the world's population lived in poverty, to get to 18 percent poverty this year.Did we hit this target? Well, no, we didn't. We exceeded it. This year, global poverty is going to fall to 12 percent. Now, that's still not good enough, and the world does still have plenty of problems. But the pessimists and doomsayers who say that the world can't get better are simply wrong.So how did we achieve this success? Well, a lot of it was because of economic growth. Some of the biggest reductions in poverty were in countries such as China and India, which have seen rapid economic growth in recent years. So can we pull off the same trick again? Can economic growth get us to the Global Goals? Well, to answer that question, we need to benchmark where the world is today against the Global Goals and figure out how far we have to travel.But that ain't easy, because the Global Goals aren't just ambitious, they're also pretty complicated. Over 17 goals, there are then 169 targets and literally hundreds of indicators. Also, while some of the goals are pretty specific \u2014 end hunger \u2014 others are a lot vaguer \u2014 promote peaceful and tolerant societies.So to help us with this benchmarking, I'm going to use a tool called the Social Progress Index. What this does is measures all the stuff the Global Goals are trying to achieve, but sums it up into a single number that we can use as our benchmark and track progress over time.The Social Progress Index basically asks three fundamental questions about a society. First of all, does everyone have the basic needs of survival: food, water, shelter, safety? Secondly, does everyone have the building blocks of a better life: education, information, health and a sustainable environment? And does everyone have the opportunity to improve their lives, through rights, freedom of choice, freedom from discrimination, and access to the world's most advanced knowledge?The Social Progress Index sums all this together using 52 indicators to create an aggregate score on a scale of 0 to 100. And what we find is that there's a wide diversity of performance in the world today. The highest performing country, Norway, scores 88. The lowest performing country, Central African Republic, scores 31. And we can add up all the countries together, weighting for the different population sizes, and that global score is 61. In concrete terms, that means that the average human being is living on a level of social progress about the same of Cuba or Kazakhstan today.That's where we are today: 61 out of 100. What do we have to get to to achieve the Global Goals?Now, the Global Goals are certainly ambitious, but they're not about turning the world into Norway in just 15 years. So having looked at the numbers, my estimate is that a score of 75 would not only be a giant leap forward in human well-being, it would also count as hitting the Global Goals target. So there's our target, 75 out of 100. Can we get there?Well, the Social Progress Index can help us calculate this, because as you might have noticed, there are no economic indicators in there; there's no GDP or economic growth in the Social Progress Index model. And what that lets us do is understand the relationship between economic growth and social progress.Let me show you on this chart. So here on the vertical axis, I've put social progress, the stuff the Global Goals are trying to achieve. Higher is better. And then on the horizontal axis, is GDP per capita. Further to the right means richer. And in there, I'm now going to put all the countries of the world, each one represented by a dot, and on top of that I'm going to put the regression line that shows the average relationship. And what this tells us is that as we get richer, social progress does tend to improve. However, as we get richer, each extra dollar of GDP is buying us less and less social progress. And now we can use this information to start building our forecast. So here is the world in 2015. We have a social progress score of 61 and a GDP per capita of $14,000. And the place we're trying to get to, remember, is 75, that Global Goals target. So here we are today, $14,000 per capita GDP. How rich are we going to be in 2030? That's what we need to know next. Well, the best forecast we can find comes from the US Department of Agriculture, which forecasts 3.1 percent average global economic growth over the next 15 years, which means that in 2030, if they're right, per capita GDP will be about $23,000. So now the question is: if we get that much richer, how much social progress are we going to get? Well, we asked a team of economists at Deloitte who checked and crunched the numbers, and they came back and said, well, look: if the world's average wealth goes from $14,000 a year to $23,000 a year, social progress is going to increase from 61 to 62.4.(Laughter)Just 62.4. Just a tiny increase.Now this seems a bit strange. Economic growth seems to have really helped in the fight against poverty, but it doesn't seem to be having much impact on trying to get to the Global Goals. So what's going on? Well, I think there are two things. The first is that in a way, we're the victims of our own success. We've used up the easy wins from economic growth, and now we're moving on to harder problems. And also, we know that economic growth comes with costs as well as benefits. There are costs to the environment, costs from new health problems like obesity.So that's the bad news. We're not going to get to the Global Goals just by getting richer.So are the pessimists right?Well, maybe not. Because the Social Progress Index also has some very good news. Let me take you back to that regression line. So this is the average relationship between GDP and social progress, and this is what our last forecast was based on. But as you saw already, there is actually lots of noise around this trend line.What that tells us, quite simply, is that GDP is not destiny. We have countries that are underperforming on social progress, relative to their wealth. Russia has lots of natural resource wealth, but lots of social problems. China has boomed economically, but hasn't made much headway on human rights or environmental issues. India has a space program and millions of people without toilets. Now, on the other hand, we have countries that are overperforming on social progress relative to their GDP. Costa Rica has prioritized education, health and environmental sustainability, and as a result, it's achieving a very high level of social progress, despite only having a rather modest GDP. And Costa Rica's not alone. From poor countries like Rwanda to richer countries like New Zealand, we see that it's possible to get lots of social progress, even if your GDP is not so great.And that's really important, because it tells us two things. First of all, it tells us that we already in the world have the solutions to many of the problems that the Global Goals are trying to solve. It also tells us that we're not slaves to GDP. Our choices matter: if we prioritize the well-being of people, then we can make a lot more progress than our GDP might expect.How much? Enough to get us to the Global Goals? Well, let's look at some numbers. What we know already: the world today is scoring 61 on social progress, and the place we want to get to is 75. If we rely on economic growth alone, we're going to get to 62.4. So let's assume now that we can get the countries that are currently underperforming on social progress \u2014 the Russia, China, Indias \u2014 just up to the average. How much social progress does that get us? Well, that takes us to 65. It's a bit better, but still quite a long way to go. So let's get a little bit more optimistic and say, what if every country gets a little bit better at turning its wealth into well-being? Well then, we get to 67. And now let's be even bolder still. What if every country in the world chose to be like Costa Rica in prioritizing human well-being, using its wealth for the well-being of its citizens? Well then, we get to nearly 73, very close to the Global Goals.Can we achieve the Global Goals? Certainly not with business as usual. Even a flood tide of economic growth is not going to get us there, if it just raises the mega-yachts and the super-wealthy and leaves the rest behind. If we're going to achieve the Global Goals we have to do things differently. We have to prioritize social progress, and really scale solutions around the world. I believe the Global Goals are a historic opportunity, because the world's leaders have promised to deliver them. Let's not dismiss the goals or slide into pessimism; let's hold them to that promise. And we need to hold them to that promise by holding them accountable, tracking their progress all the way through the next 15 years.And I want to finish by showing you a way to do that, called the People's Report Card. The People's Report Card brings together all this data into a simple framework that we'll all be familiar with from our school days, to hold them to account. It grades our performance on the Global Goals on a scale from F to A, where F is humanity at its worst, and A is humanity at its best. Our world today is scoring a C-. The Global Goals are all about getting to an A, and that's why we're going to be updating the People's Report Card annually, for the world and for all the countries of the world, so we can hold our leaders to account to achieve this target and fulfill this promise. Because getting to the Global Goals will only happen if we do things differently, if our leaders do things differently, and for that to happen, that needs us to demand it.So let's reject business as usual. Let's demand a different path. Let's choose the world that we want.Thank you.(Applause)Bruno Giussani: Thank you, Michael. Michael, just one question: the Millennium Development Goals established 15 years ago, they were kind of applying to every country but it turned out to be really a scorecard for emerging countries. Now the new Global Goals are explicitly universal. They ask for every country to show action and to show progress. How can I, as a private citizen, use the report card to create pressure for action?Michael Green: This is a really important point; it's a big shift in priorities \u2014 it's no longer about poor countries and just poverty. It's about every country. And every country is going to have challenges in getting to the Global Goals. Even, I'm sorry to say, Bruno, Switzerland has got to work to do. And so that's why we're going to produce these report cards in 2016 for every country in the world. Then we can really see, how are we doing? And it's not going to be rich countries scoring straight A's. And that, then, I think, is to provide a point of focus for people to start demanding action and start demanding progress.BG: Thank you very much.(Applause)", "id": 2348, "subtitle":

exercise.\n\n00:00:53.616 --> 00:00:59.043\nThe Global Goals are who we,\nhumanity, want to be.\n\n00:00:59.381 --> 00:01:03.533\nNow that's the plan, but can we get there?\n\n00:01:03.557 --> 00:01:07.578\nCan this vision for a better world\nreally be achieved?\n\n00:01:08.205 --> 00:01:11.965\nWell, I'm here today because\nwe've run the numbers,\n\n00:01:11.989 --> 00:01:16.533\nand the answer, shockingly,\n\n00:01:16.557 --> 00:01:19.001\nis that maybe we actually can.\n\n00:01:19.557 --> 00:01:22.660\nBut not with business as usual.\n\n00:01:23.715 --> 00:01:26.770\nNow, the idea that the world\nis going to get a better place\n\n00:01:26.794 --> 00:01:28.699\nmay seem a little fanciful.\n\n00:01:29.128 --> 00:01:33.533\nWatch the news every day and the world\nseems to be going backwards, not forwards.\n\n00:01:33.557 --> 00:01:35.255\nAnd let's be frank:\n\n00:01:35.279 --> 00:01:38.533\nit's pretty easy to be skeptical\nabout grand announcements\n\n00:01:38.557 --> 00:01:39.976\ncoming out of the UN.\n\n00:01:41.025 --> 00:01:45.120\nBut please, I invite you to suspend\nyour disbelief for just a moment.\n\n00:01:45.914 --> 00:01:47.811\nBecause back in 2001,\n\n00:01:47.835 --> 00:01:52.355\nthe UN agreed another set of goals,\nthe Millennium Development Goals.\n\n00:01:53.096 --> 00:01:57.296\nAnd the flagship target there\nwas to halve the proportion of people\n\n00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:00.271\nliving in poverty by 2015.\n\n00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:04.847\nThe target was to take\nfrom a baseline of 1990,\n\n00:02:04.871 --> 00:02:08.533\nwhen 36 percent of the world's\npopulation lived in poverty,\n\n00:02:08.557 --> 00:02:11.750\nto get to 18 percent poverty this year.\n\n00:02:12.557 --> 00:02:14.533\nDid we hit this target?\n\n00:02:14.557 --> 00:02:16.008\nWell, no, we didn't.\n\n00:02:16.557 --> 00:02:18.238\nWe exceeded it.\n\n00:02:18.635 --> 00:02:22.818\nThis year, global poverty\nis going to fall to 12 percent.\n\n00:02:23.762 --> 00:02:25.533\nNow, that's still not good enough,\n\n00:02:25.557 --> 00:02:29.176\nand the world does still have\nplenty of problems.\n\n00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:34.635\nBut the pessimists and doomsayers\nwho say that the world can't get better\n\n00:02:34.659 --> 00:02:35.968\nare simply wrong.\n\n00:02:37.706 --> 00:02:39.533\nSo how did we achieve this success?\n\n00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:42.698\nWell, a lot of it was because\nof economic growth.\n\n00:02:43.341 --> 00:02:48.533\nSome of the biggest reductions in poverty\nwere in countries such as China and India,\n\n00:02:48.557 --> 00:02:52.419\nwhich have seen rapid\neconomic growth in recent years.\n\n00:02:52.856 --> 00:02:55.533\nSo can we pull off the same trick again?\n\n00:02:55.892 --> 00:02:59.425\nCan economic growth\nget us to the Global Goals?\n\n00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:02.339\nWell, to answer that question,\n\n00:03:02.363 --> 00:03:06.533\nwe need to benchmark where the world\nis today against the Global Goals\n\n00:03:06.557 --> 00:03:09.131\nand figure out how far we have to travel.\n\n00:03:10.004 --> 00:03:11.907\nBut that ain't easy,\n\n00:03:11.931 --> 00:03:14.748\nbecause the Global Goals\naren't just ambitious,\n\n00:03:14.772 --> 00:03:17.027\nthey're also pretty complicated.\n\n00:03:17.557 --> 00:03:21.701\nOver 17 goals, there are then 169 targets\n\n00:03:21.725 --> 00:03:24.410\nand literally hundreds of indicators.\n\n00:03:25.402 --> 00:03:29.006\nAlso, while some of the goals\nare pretty specific --\n\n00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:30.453\nend hunger --\n\n00:03:30.477 --> 00:03:32.373\nothers are a lot vaguer --\n\n00:03:32.397 --> 00:03:34.999\npromote peaceful and tolerant societies.\n\n00:03:35.882 --> 00:03:37.807\nSo to help us with this benchmarking,\n\n00:03:37.831 --> 00:03:41.577\nI'm going to use a tool\ncalled the Social Progress Index.\n\n00:03:42.124 --> 00:03:46.078\nWhat this does is measures all the stuff\nthe Global Goals are trying to achieve,\n\n00:03:46.102 --> 00:03:50.264\nbut sums it up into a single number\nthat we can use as our benchmark\n\n00:03:50.288 --> 00:03:52.437\nand track progress over time.\n\n00:03:52.858 --> 00:03:56.411\nThe Social Progress Index basically asks\nthree fundamental questions\n\n00:03:56.435 --> 00:03:57.696\nabout a society.\n\n00:03:58.172 --> 00:04:01.637\nFirst of all, does everyone have\nthe basic needs of survival:\n\n00:04:01.661 --> 00:04:04.469\nfood, water, shelter, safety?\n\n00:04:04.493 --> 00:04:08.247\nSecondly, does everyone have\nthe building blocks of a better life:\n\n00:04:08.271 --> 00:04:12.532\neducation, information, health\nand a sustainable environment?\n\n00:04:13.111 --> 00:04:16.797\nAnd does everyone have\nthe opportunity to improve their lives,\n\n00:04:16.821 --> 00:04:20.821\nthrough rights, freedom of choice,\nfreedom from discrimination,\n\n00:04:20.845 --> 00:04:23.548\nand access to the world's\nmost advanced knowledge?\n\n00:04:24.421 --> 00:04:28.533\nThe Social Progress Index sums all this\ntogether using 52 indicators\n\n00:04:28.557 --> 00:04:32.489\nto create an aggregate score\non a scale of 0 to 100.\n\n00:04:33.394 --> 00:04:36.557\nAnd what we find is that there's\na wide diversity of performance\n\n00:04:36.581 --> 00:04:37.742\nin the world today.\n\n00:04:38.147 --> 00:04:41.676\nThe highest performing country,\nNorway, scores 88.\n\n00:04:42.239 --> 00:04:46.626\nThe lowest performing country,\nCentral African Republic, scores 31.\n\n00:04:47.557 --> 00:04:49.653\nAnd we can add up\nall the countries together,\n\n00:04:49.677 --> 00:04:52.111\nweighting for the different\npopulation sizes,\n\n00:04:52.135 --> 00:04:55.533\nand that global score is 61.\n\n00:04:56.118 --> 00:04:57.269\nIn concrete terms,\n\n00:04:57.293 --> 00:05:01.051\nthat means that the average human being\nis living on a level of social progress\n\n00:05:01.075 --> 00:05:04.497\nabout the same of Cuba\nor Kazakhstan today.\n\n00:05:05.187 --> 00:05:07.743\nThat's where we are today: 61 out of 100.\n\n00:05:08.378 --> 00:05:11.386\nWhat do we have to get to\nto achieve the Global Goals?\n\n00:05:12.212 --> 00:05:14.700\nNow, the Global Goals\nare certainly ambitious,\n\n00:05:14.724 --> 00:05:18.758\nbut they're not about turning the world\ninto Norway in just 15 years.\n\n00:05:19.353 --> 00:05:23.452\nSo having looked at the numbers,\nmy estimate is that a score of 75\n\n00:05:23.476 --> 00:05:27.533\nwould not only be a giant leap forward\nin human well-being,\n\n00:05:27.557 --> 00:05:30.679\nit would also count as hitting\nthe Global Goals target.\n\n00:05:31.370 --> 00:05:34.156\nSo there's our target, 75 out of 100.\n\n00:05:34.180 --> 00:05:36.209\nCan we get there?\n\n00:05:36.233 --> 00:05:39.217\nWell, the Social Progress Index\ncan help us calculate this,\n\n00:05:39.241 --> 00:05:40.907\nbecause as you might have noticed,\n\n00:05:40.931 --> 00:05:43.156\nthere are no economic indicators in there;\n\n00:05:43.180 --> 00:05:47.657\nthere's no GDP or economic growth\nin the Social Progress Index model.\n\n00:05:47.990 --> 00:05:51.533\nAnd what that lets us do\nis understand the relationship\n\n00:05:51.557 --> 00:05:54.841\nbetween economic growth\nand social progress.\n\n00:05:55.707 --> 00:05:57.327\nLet me show you on this chart.\n\n00:05:57.351 --> 00:06:00.533\nSo here on the vertical axis,\nI've put social progress,\n\n00:06:00.557 --> 00:06:03.125\nthe stuff the Global Goals\nare trying to achieve.\n\n00:06:03.149 --> 00:06:04.695\nHigher is better.\n\n00:06:04.719 --> 00:06:08.103\nAnd then on the horizontal axis,\nis GDP per capita.\n\n00:06:08.127 --> 00:06:10.666\nFurther to the right means richer.\n\n00:06:10.690 --> 00:06:13.990\nAnd in there, I'm now going to put\nall the countries of the world,\n\n00:06:14.014 --> 00:06:16.122\neach one represented by a dot,\n\n00:06:16.146 --> 00:06:18.741\nand on top of that I'm going to put\nthe regression line\n\n00:06:18.765 --> 00:06:20.764\nthat shows the average relationship.\n\n00:06:21.119 --> 00:06:24.649\nAnd what this tells us\nis that as we get richer,\n\n00:06:24.673 --> 00:06:27.181\nsocial progress does tend to improve.\n\n00:06:28.030 --> 00:06:32.621\nHowever, as we get richer,\neach extra dollar of GDP\n\n00:06:32.645 --> 00:06:36.242\nis buying us less and less\nsocial progress.\n\n00:06:37.067 --> 00:06:40.806\nAnd now we can use this information\nto start building our forecast.\n\n00:06:41.361 --> 00:06:44.167\nSo here is the world in 2015.\n\n00:06:44.676 --> 00:06:48.074\nWe have a social progress score of 61\n\n00:06:48.098 --> 00:06:51.282\nand a GDP per capita of $14,000.\n\n00:06:51.853 --> 00:06:56.081\nAnd the place we're trying to get to,\nremember, is 75, that Global Goals target.\n\n00:06:56.105 --> 00:06:59.763\nSo here we are today,\n$14,000 per capita GDP.\n\n00:07:00.248 --> 00:07:02.613\nHow rich are we going to be in 2030?\n\n00:07:02.637 --> 00:07:04.475\nThat's what we need to know next.\n\n00:07:04.499 --> 00:07:08.750\nWell, the best forecast we can find comes\nfrom the US Department of Agriculture,\n\n00:07:08.774 --> 00:07:13.425\nwhich forecasts 3.1 percent\naverage global economic growth\n\n00:07:13.449 --> 00:07:15.193\nover the next 15 years,\n\n00:07:15.217 --> 00:07:18.336\nwhich means that in 2030,\nif they're right,\n\n00:07:18.360 --> 00:07:22.386\nper capita GDP will be about $23,000.\n\n00:07:23.251 --> 00:07:25.792\nSo now the question is:\nif we get that much richer,\n\n00:07:25.816 --> 00:07:28.117\nhow much social progress\nare we going to get?\n\n00:07:28.705 --> 00:07:31.315\nWell, we asked a team\nof economists at Deloitte\n\n00:07:31.339 --> 00:07:33.108\nwho checked and crunched the numbers,\n\n00:07:33.132 --> 00:07:38.084\nand they came back and said, well, look:\nif the world's average wealth goes\n\n00:07:38.108 --> 00:07:41.884\nfrom $14,000 a year to $23,000 a year,\n\n00:07:41.908 --> 00:07:44.196\nsocial progress is going to increase\n\n00:07:44.220 --> 00:07:48.583\nfrom 61 to 62.4.\n\n00:07:48.884 --> 00:07:50.797\n(Laughter)\n\n00:07:50.821 --> 00:07:55.320\nJust 62.4. Just a tiny increase.\n\n00:07:56.273 --> 00:07:57.820\nNow this seems a bit strange.\n\n00:07:57.844 --> 00:08:00.056\nEconomic growth seems\nto have really helped\n\n00:08:00.080 --> 00:08:01.769\nin the fight against poverty,\n\n00:08:01.793 --> 00:08:03.993\nbut it doesn't seem\nto be having much impact\n\n00:08:04.017 --> 00:08:06.100\non trying to get to the Global Goals.\n\n00:08:06.425 --> 00:08:07.719\nSo what's going on?\n\n00:08:08.140 --> 00:08:09.831\nWell, I think there are two things.\n\n00:08:09.855 --> 00:08:13.722\nThe first is that in a way,\nwe're the victims of our own success.\n\n00:08:13.746 --> 00:08:16.738\nWe've used up the easy wins\nfrom economic growth,\n\n00:08:16.762 --> 00:08:19.110\nand now we're moving on\nto harder problems.\n\n00:08:19.608 --> 00:08:23.996\nAnd also, we know that economic growth\ncomes with costs as well as benefits.\n\n00:08:24.020 --> 00:08:28.544\nThere are costs to the environment, costs\nfrom new health problems like obesity.\n\n00:08:29.783 --> 00:08:31.068\nSo that's the bad news.\n\n00:08:31.489 --> 00:08:35.399\nWe're not going to get to the Global Goals\njust by getting richer.\n\n00:08:36.169 --> 00:08:37.991\nSo are the pessimists right?\n\n00:08:38.557 --> 00:08:39.899\nWell, maybe not.\n\n00:08:39.923 --> 00:08:43.826\nBecause the Social Progress Index\nalso has some very good news.\n\n00:08:44.641 --> 00:08:47.000\nLet me take you back\nto that regression line.\n\n00:08:47.024 --> 00:08:50.404\nSo this is the average relationship\nbetween GDP and social progress,\n\n00:08:50.428 --> 00:08:53.314\nand this is what our\nlast forecast was based on.\n\n00:08:53.998 --> 00:08:55.671\nBut as you saw already,\n\n00:08:55.695 --> 00:08:59.620\nthere is actually lots of noise\naround this trend line.\n\n00:09:00.429 --> 00:09:02.866\nWhat that tells us, quite simply,\n\n00:09:02.890 --> 00:09:05.993\nis that GDP is not destiny.\n\n00:09:06.547 --> 00:09:09.025\nWe have countries that are underperforming\n\n00:09:09.049 --> 00:09:11.698\non social progress,\nrelative to their wealth.\n\n00:09:12.279 --> 00:09:14.629\nRussia has lots\nof natural resource wealth,\n\n00:09:14.653 --> 00:09:16.805\nbut lots of social problems.\n\n00:09:16.829 --> 00:09:19.060\nChina has boomed economically,\n\n00:09:19.084 --> 00:09:23.287\nbut hasn't made much headway\non human rights or environmental issues.\n\n00:09:23.888 --> 00:09:28.532\nIndia has a space program\nand millions of people without toilets.\n\n00:09:29.222 --> 00:09:32.519\nNow, on the other hand, we have countries\nthat are overperforming\n\n00:09:32.543 --> 00:09:35.533\non social progress relative to their GDP.\n\n00:09:35.880 --> 00:09:41.591\nCosta Rica has prioritized education,\nhealth and environmental sustainability,\n\n00:09:41.615 --> 00:09:45.536\nand as a result, it's achieving\na very high level of social progress,\n\n00:09:45.560 --> 00:09:48.810\ndespite only having a rather modest GDP.\n\n00:09:49.429 --> 00:09:51.533\nAnd Costa Rica's not alone.\n\n00:09:51.557 --> 00:09:55.533\nFrom poor countries like Rwanda\nto richer countries like New Zealand,\n\n00:09:55.557 --> 00:09:59.155\nwe see that it's possible to get\nlots of social progress,\n\n00:09:59.179 --> 00:10:01.782\neven if your GDP is not so great.\n\n00:10:02.607 --> 00:10:05.861\nAnd that's really important,\nbecause it tells us two things.\n\n00:10:06.242 --> 00:10:11.450\nFirst of all, it tells us that we already\nin the world have the solutions\n\n00:10:11.474 --> 00:10:15.302\nto many of the problems\nthat the Global Goals are trying to solve.\n\n00:10:15.837 --> 00:10:19.559\nIt also tells us\nthat we're not slaves to GDP.\n\n00:10:19.987 --> 00:10:24.262\nOur choices matter: if we prioritize\nthe well-being of people,\n\n00:10:24.286 --> 00:10:28.162\nthen we can make a lot more progress\nthan our GDP might expect.\n\n00:10:28.966 --> 00:10:32.118\nHow much? Enough to get us\nto the Global Goals?\n\n00:10:32.142 --> 00:10:33.753\nWell, let's look at some numbers.\n\n00:10:33.777 --> 00:10:37.638\nWhat we know already: the world today\nis scoring 61 on social progress,\n\n00:10:37.662 --> 00:10:40.460\nand the place we want to get to is 75.\n\n00:10:40.484 --> 00:10:42.704\nIf we rely on economic growth alone,\n\n00:10:42.728 --> 00:10:45.309\nwe're going to get to 62.4.\n\n00:10:45.333 --> 00:10:49.435\nSo let's assume now that we can get\nthe countries that are currently\n\n00:10:49.459 --> 00:10:52.653\nunderperforming on social progress --\nthe Russia, China, Indias --\n\n00:10:52.677 --> 00:10:53.977\njust up to the average.\n\n00:10:54.366 --> 00:10:56.557\nHow much social progress does that get us?\n\n00:10:56.581 --> 00:10:58.692\nWell, that takes us to 65.\n\n00:10:59.255 --> 00:11:02.161\nIt's a bit better, but still\nquite a long way to go.\n\n00:11:02.185 --> 00:11:04.546\nSo let's get a little bit more\noptimistic and say,\n\n00:11:04.570 --> 00:11:07.360\nwhat if every country\ngets a little bit better\n\n00:11:07.384 --> 00:11:09.771\nat turning its wealth into well-being?\n\n00:11:10.152 --> 00:11:12.549\nWell then, we get to 67.\n\n00:11:13.398 --> 00:11:16.053\nAnd now let's be even bolder still.\n\n00:11:16.077 --> 00:11:20.533\nWhat if every country in the world\nchose to be like Costa Rica\n\n00:11:20.557 --> 00:11:22.927\nin prioritizing human well-being,\n\n00:11:22.951 --> 00:11:25.533\nusing its wealth for the well-being\nof its citizens?\n\n00:11:25.557 --> 00:11:29.776\nWell then, we get to nearly 73,\nvery close to the Global Goals.\n\n00:11:30.557 --> 00:11:32.533\nCan we achieve the Global Goals?\n\n00:11:32.557 --> 00:11:34.759\nCertainly not with business as usual.\n\n00:11:35.236 --> 00:11:39.587\nEven a flood tide of economic growth\nis not going to get us there,\n\n00:11:39.611 --> 00:11:42.674\nif it just raises the mega-yachts\nand the super-wealthy\n\n00:11:42.698 --> 00:11:44.492\nand leaves the rest behind.\n\n00:11:45.135 --> 00:11:49.129\nIf we're going to achieve the Global Goals\nwe have to do things differently.\n\n00:11:49.153 --> 00:11:53.362\nWe have to prioritize social progress,\nand really scale solutions\n\n00:11:53.386 --> 00:11:54.876\naround the world.\n\n00:11:54.900 --> 00:11:58.615\nI believe the Global Goals\nare a historic opportunity,\n\n00:11:58.639 --> 00:12:02.234\nbecause the world's leaders\nhave promised to deliver them.\n\n00:12:03.059 --> 00:12:07.032\nLet's not dismiss the goals\nor slide into pessimism;\n\n00:12:07.056 --> 00:12:09.048\nlet's hold them to that promise.\n\n00:12:09.787 --> 00:12:13.117\nAnd we need to hold them to that promise\nby holding them accountable,\n\n00:12:13.141 --> 00:12:16.432\ntracking their progress all the way\nthrough the next 15 years.\n\n00:12:16.886 --> 00:12:18.568\nAnd I want to finish by showing you\n\n00:12:18.592 --> 00:12:21.357\na way to do that, called\nthe People's Report Card.\n\n00:12:21.381 --> 00:12:26.288\nThe People's Report Card brings together\nall this data into a simple framework\n\n00:12:26.312 --> 00:12:28.852\nthat we'll all be familiar\nwith from our school days,\n\n00:12:28.876 --> 00:12:30.304\nto hold them to account.\n\n00:12:30.328 --> 00:12:32.583\nIt grades our performance\non the Global Goals\n\n00:12:32.607 --> 00:12:36.078\non a scale from F to A,\n\n00:12:36.102 --> 00:12:41.195\nwhere F is humanity at its worst,\nand A is humanity at its best.\n\n00:12:41.648 --> 00:12:46.419\nOur world today is scoring a C-.\n\n00:12:47.363 --> 00:12:50.792\nThe Global Goals are all about\ngetting to an A,\n\n00:12:50.816 --> 00:12:54.533\nand that's why we're going to be updating\nthe People's Report Card annually,\n\n00:12:54.557 --> 00:12:57.770\nfor the world and for all\nthe countries of the world,\n\n00:12:57.794 --> 00:13:00.385\nso we can hold our leaders to account\n\n00:13:00.409 --> 00:13:04.551\nto achieve this target\nand fulfill this promise.\n\n00:13:05.138 --> 00:13:09.785\nBecause getting to the Global Goals will\nonly happen if we do things differently,\n\n00:13:09.809 --> 00:13:11.976\nif our leaders do things differently,\n\n00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:15.897\nand for that to happen,\nthat needs us to demand it.\n\n00:13:16.452 --> 00:13:19.929\nSo let's reject business as usual.\n\n00:13:20.413 --> 00:13:22.871\nLet's demand a different path.\n\n00:13:23.323 --> 00:13:27.141\nLet's choose the world that we want.\n\n00:13:28.115 --> 00:13:29.267\nThank you.\n\n00:13:29.291 --> 00:13:34.533\n(Applause)\n\n00:13:34.557 --> 00:13:36.434\nBruno Giussani: Thank you, Michael.\n\n00:13:38.633 --> 00:13:41.456\nMichael, just one question:\nthe Millennium Development Goals\n\n00:13:41.480 --> 00:13:42.961\nestablished 15 years ago,\n\n00:13:42.985 --> 00:13:46.062\nthey were kind of applying\nto every country\n\n00:13:46.086 --> 00:13:49.653\nbut it turned out to be really\na scorecard for emerging countries.\n\n00:13:49.677 --> 00:13:52.129\nNow the new Global Goals\nare explicitly universal.\n\n00:13:52.153 --> 00:13:56.305\nThey ask for every country to show action\nand to show progress.\n\n00:13:56.329 --> 00:13:59.317\nHow can I, as a private citizen,\nuse the report card\n\n00:13:59.341 --> 00:14:02.175\nto create pressure for action?\n\n00:14:02.199 --> 00:14:06.074\nMichael Green: This is a really important\npoint; it's a big shift in priorities --\n\n00:14:06.098 --> 00:14:08.577\nit's no longer about poor\ncountries and just poverty.\n\n00:14:08.601 --> 00:14:09.816\nIt's about every country.\n\n00:14:09.840 --> 00:14:13.470\nAnd every country is going to have\nchallenges in getting to the Global Goals.\n\n00:14:13.494 --> 00:14:16.804\nEven, I'm sorry to say, Bruno,\nSwitzerland has got to work to do.\n\n00:14:16.828 --> 00:14:20.198\nAnd so that's why we're going to produce\nthese report cards in 2016\n\n00:14:20.222 --> 00:14:21.708\nfor every country in the world.\n\n00:14:21.732 --> 00:14:23.811\nThen we can really see, how are we doing?\n\n00:14:23.835 --> 00:14:26.716\nAnd it's not going to be rich countries\nscoring straight A's.\n\n00:14:26.740 --> 00:14:29.348\nAnd that, then, I think,\nis to provide a point of focus\n\n00:14:29.372 --> 00:14:32.828\nfor people to start demanding action\nand start demanding progress.\n\n00:14:32.852 --> 00:14:34.300\nBG: Thank you very much.\n\n00:14:34.324 -->

autonomous aerial robots like the one you see flying here. Unlike the commercially available drones that you can buy today, this robot doesn't have any GPS on board. So without GPS, it's hard for robots like this to determine their position. This robot uses onboard sensors, cameras and laser scanners, to scan the environment. It detects features from the environment, and it determines where it is relative to those features, using a method of triangulation. And then it can assemble all these features into a map, like you see behind me. And this map then allows the robot to understand where the obstacles are and navigate in a collision-free manner.What I want to show you next is a set of experiments we did inside our laboratory, where this robot was able to go for longer distances. So here you'll see, on the top right, what the robot sees with the camera. And on the main screen \u2014 and of course this is sped up by a factor of four \u2014 on the main screen you'll see the map that it's building. So this is a high-resolution map of the corridor around our laboratory. And in a minute you'll see it enter our lab, which is recognizable by the clutter that you see.(Laughter)But the main point I want to convey to you is that these robots are capable of building high-resolution maps at five centimeters resolution, allowing somebody who is outside the lab, or outside the building to deploy these without actually going inside, and trying to infer what happens inside the building.Now there's one problem with robots like this. The first problem is it's pretty big. Because it's big, it's heavy. And these robots consume about 100 watts per pound. And this makes for a very short mission life. The second problem is that these robots have onboard sensors that end up being very expensive \u2014 a laser scanner, a camera and the processors. That drives up the cost of this robot.So we asked ourselves a question: what consumer product can you buy in an electronics store that is inexpensive, that's lightweight, that has sensing onboard and computation? And we invented the flying phone.(Laughter)So this robot uses a Samsung Galaxy smartphone that you can buy off the shelf, and all you need is an app that you can download from our app store. And you can see this robot reading the letters, \"TED\" in this case, looking at the corners of the \"T\" and the \"E\" and then triangulating off of that, flying autonomously. That joystick is just there to make sure if the robot goes crazy, Giuseppe can kill it.(Laughter)In addition to building these small robots, we also experiment with aggressive behaviors, like you see here. So this robot is now traveling at two to three meters per second, pitching and rolling aggressively as it changes direction. The main point is we can have smaller robots that can go faster and then travel in these very unstructured environments.And in this next video, just like you see this bird, an eagle, gracefully coordinating its wings, its eyes and feet to grab prey out of the water, our robot can go fishing, too.(Laughter)In this case, this is a Philly cheesesteak hoagie that it's grabbing out of thin air.(Laughter)So you can see this robot going at about three meters per second, which is faster than walking speed, coordinating its arms, its claws and its flight with split-second timing to achieve this maneuver. In another experiment, I want to show you how the robot adapts its flight to control its suspended payload, whose length is actually larger than the width of the window. So in order to accomplish this, it actually has to pitch and adjust the altitude and swing the payload through. But of course we want to make these even smaller, and we're inspired in particular by honeybees. So if you look at honeybees, and this is a slowed down video, they're so small, the inertia is so lightweight \u2014(Laughter)that they don't care \u2014 they bounce off my hand, for example. This is a little robot that mimics the honeybee behavior. And smaller is better, because along with the small size you get lower inertia. Along with lower inertia \u2014(Robot buzzing, laughter)along with lower inertia, you're resistant to collisions. And that makes you more robust. So just like these honeybees, we build small robots. And this particular one is only 25 grams in weight. It consumes only six watts of power. And it can travel up to six meters per second. So if I normalize that to its size, it's like a Boeing 787 traveling ten times the speed of sound.(Laughter)And I want to show you an example. This is probably the first planned mid-air collision, at one-twentieth normal speed. These are going at a relative speed of two meters per second, and this illustrates the basic principle. The two-gram carbon fiber cage around it prevents the propellers from entangling, but essentially the collision is absorbed and the robot responds to the collisions. And so small also means safe. In my lab, as we developed these robots, we start off with these big robots and then now we're down to these small robots. And if you plot a histogram of the number of Band-Aids we've ordered in the past, that sort of tailed off now. Because these robots are really safe.The small size has some disadvantages, and nature has found a number of ways to compensate for these disadvantages. The basic idea is they aggregate to form large groups, or swarms. So, similarly, in our lab, we try to create artificial robot swarms. And this is quite challenging because now you have to think about networks of robots. And within each robot, you have to think about the interplay of sensing, communication, computation \u2014 and this network then becomes quite difficult to control and manage. So from nature we take away three organizing principles that essentially allow us to develop our algorithms. The first idea is that robots need to be aware of their neighbors. They need to be able to sense and communicate with their neighbors.So this video illustrates the basic idea. You have four robots \u2014 one of the robots has actually been hijacked by a human operator, literally. But because the robots interact with each other, they sense their neighbors, they essentially follow. And here there's a single person able to lead this network of followers. So again, it's not because all the robots know where they're supposed to go. It's because they're just reacting to the positions of their neighbors.(Laughter)So the next experiment illustrates the second organizing principle. And this principle has to do with the principle of anonymity. Here the key idea is that the robots are agnostic to the identities of their neighbors. They're asked to form a circular shape, and no matter how many robots you introduce into the formation, or how many robots you pull out, each robot is simply reacting to its neighbor. It's aware of the fact that it needs to form the circular shape, but collaborating with its neighbors it forms the shape without central coordination. Now if you put these ideas together, the third idea is that we essentially give these robots mathematical descriptions of the shape they need to execute. And these shapes can be varying as a function of time, and you'll see these robots start from a circular formation, change into a rectangular formation, stretch into a straight line, back into an ellipse. And they do this with the same kind of split-second coordination that you see in natural swarms, in nature.So why work with swarms? Let me tell you about two applications that we are very interested in. The first one has to do with agriculture, which is probably the biggest problem that we're facing worldwide. As you well know, one in every seven persons in this earth is malnourished. Most of the land that we can cultivate has already been cultivated. And the efficiency of most systems in the world is improving, but our production system efficiency is actually declining. And that's mostly because of water shortage, crop diseases, climate change and a couple of other things.So what can robots do? Well, we adopt an approach that's called Precision Farming in the community. And the basic idea is that we fly aerial robots through orchards, and then we build precision models of individual plants. So just like personalized medicine, while you might imagine wanting to treat every patient individually, what we'd like to do is build models of individual plants and then tell the farmer what kind of inputs every plant needs \u2014 the inputs in this case being water, fertilizer and pesticide. Here you'll see robots traveling through an apple orchard, and in a minute you'll see two of its companions doing the same thing on the left side. And what they're doing is essentially building a map of the orchard. Within the map is a map of every plant in this orchard.(Robot buzzing)Let's see what those maps look like. In the next video, you'll see the cameras that are being used on this robot. On the top-left is essentially a standard color camera. On the left-center is an infrared camera. And on the bottom-left is a thermal camera. And on the main panel, you're seeing a three-dimensional reconstruction of every tree in the orchard as the sensors fly right past the trees. Armed with information like this, we can do several things. The first and possibly the most important thing we can do is very simple: count the number of fruits on every tree. By doing this, you tell the farmer how many fruits she has in every tree and allow her to estimate the yield in the orchard, optimizing the production chain downstream.The second thing we can do is take models of plants, construct three-dimensional reconstructions, and from that estimate the canopy size, and then correlate the canopy size to the amount of leaf area on every plant. And this is called the leaf area index. So if you know this leaf area index, you essentially have a measure of how much photosynthesis is possible in every plant, which again tells you how healthy each plant is. By combining visual and infrared information, we can also compute indices such as NDVI. And in this particular case, you can essentially see there are some crops that are not doing as well as other crops. This is easily discernible from imagery, not just visual imagery but combining both visual imagery and infrared imagery.And then lastly, one thing we're interested in doing is detecting the early onset of chlorosis \u2014 and this is an orange tree \u2014 which is essentially seen by yellowing of leaves. But robots flying overhead can easily spot this autonomously and then report to the farmer that he or she has a problem in this section of the orchard.Systems like this can really help, and we're projecting yields that can improve by about ten percent and, more importantly, decrease the amount of inputs such as water by 25 percent by using aerial robot swarms.Lastly, I want you to applaud the people who actually create the future, Yash Mulgaonkar, Sikang Liu and Giuseppe Loianno, who are responsible for the three demonstrations that you saw.Thank you.(Applause)", "id": 2346, "subtitle":

here.\n\n00:03:19.878 --> 00:03:25.174\nSo this robot is now traveling\nat two to three meters per second,\n\n00:03:25.198 --> 00:03:28.694\npitching and rolling aggressively\nas it changes direction.\n\n00:03:28.718 --> 00:03:32.974\nThe main point is we can have\nsmaller robots that can go faster\n\n00:03:32.998 --> 00:03:35.958\nand then travel in these\nvery unstructured environments.\n\n00:03:37.078 --> 00:03:39.134\nAnd in this next video,\n\n00:03:39.158 --> 00:03:45.054\njust like you see this bird, an eagle,\ngracefully coordinating its wings,\n\n00:03:45.078 --> 00:03:49.374\nits eyes and feet\nto grab prey out of the water,\n\n00:03:49.398 --> 00:03:51.294\nour robot can go fishing, too.\n\n00:03:51.318 --> 00:03:52.814\n(Laughter)\n\n00:03:52.838 --> 00:03:56.894\nIn this case, this is a Philly cheesesteak\nhoagie that it's grabbing out of thin air.\n\n00:03:56.918 --> 00:03:59.318\n(Laughter)\n\n00:03:59.638 --> 00:04:02.934\nSo you can see this robot\ngoing at about three meters per second,\n\n00:04:02.958 --> 00:04:08.094\nwhich is faster than walking speed,\ncoordinating its arms, its claws\n\n00:04:08.118 --> 00:04:12.238\nand its flight with split-second timing\nto achieve this maneuver.\n\n00:04:14.078 --> 00:04:15.294\nIn another experiment,\n\n00:04:15.318 --> 00:04:18.974\nI want to show you\nhow the robot adapts its flight\n\n00:04:18.998 --> 00:04:21.374\nto control its suspended payload,\n\n00:04:21.398 --> 00:04:25.198\nwhose length is actually larger\nthan the width of the window.\n\n00:04:25.638 --> 00:04:27.334\nSo in order to accomplish this,\n\n00:04:27.358 --> 00:04:31.054\nit actually has to pitch\nand adjust the altitude\n\n00:04:31.078 --> 00:04:33.398\nand swing the payload through.\n\n00:04:38.878 --> 00:04:41.174\nBut of course we want\nto make these even smaller,\n\n00:04:41.198 --> 00:04:44.214\nand we're inspired\nin particular by honeybees.\n\n00:04:44.238 --> 00:04:47.494\nSo if you look at honeybees,\nand this is a slowed down video,\n\n00:04:47.518 --> 00:04:51.238\nthey're so small,\nthe inertia is so lightweight --\n\n00:04:51.918 --> 00:04:53.094\n(Laughter)\n\n00:04:53.118 --> 00:04:56.654\nthat they don't care --\nthey bounce off my hand, for example.\n\n00:04:56.678 --> 00:04:59.838\nThis is a little robot\nthat mimics the honeybee behavior.\n\n00:05:00.558 --> 00:05:01.774\nAnd smaller is better,\n\n00:05:01.798 --> 00:05:05.334\nbecause along with the small size\nyou get lower inertia.\n\n00:05:05.358 --> 00:05:06.894\nAlong with lower inertia --\n\n00:05:06.918 --> 00:05:09.774\n(Robot buzzing, laughter)\n\n00:05:09.798 --> 00:05:12.614\nalong with lower inertia,\nyou're resistant to collisions.\n\n00:05:12.638 --> 00:05:14.358\nAnd that makes you more robust.\n\n00:05:15.758 --> 00:05:18.414\nSo just like these honeybees,\nwe build small robots.\n\n00:05:18.438 --> 00:05:21.814\nAnd this particular one\nis only 25 grams in weight.\n\n00:05:21.838 --> 00:05:23.998\nIt consumes only six watts of power.\n\n00:05:24.398 --> 00:05:26.934\nAnd it can travel\nup to six meters per second.\n\n00:05:26.958 --> 00:05:29.294\nSo if I normalize that to its size,\n\n00:05:29.318 --> 00:05:32.958\nit's like a Boeing 787 traveling\nten times the speed of sound.\n\n00:05:35.958 --> 00:05:38.054\n(Laughter)\n\n00:05:38.078 --> 00:05:39.998\nAnd I want to show you an example.\n\n00:05:40.798 --> 00:05:46.054\nThis is probably the first planned mid-air\ncollision, at one-twentieth normal speed.\n\n00:05:46.078 --> 00:05:48.936\nThese are going at a relative speed\nof two meters per second,\n\n00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:51.440\nand this illustrates the basic principle.\n\n00:05:52.158 --> 00:05:57.134\nThe two-gram carbon fiber cage around it\nprevents the propellers from entangling,\n\n00:05:57.158 --> 00:06:02.454\nbut essentially the collision is absorbed\nand the robot responds to the collisions.\n\n00:06:02.478 --> 00:06:05.038\nAnd so small also means safe.\n\n00:06:05.358 --> 00:06:07.374\nIn my lab, as we developed these robots,\n\n00:06:07.398 --> 00:06:09.018\nwe start off with these big robots\n\n00:06:09.042 --> 00:06:11.854\nand then now we're down\nto these small robots.\n\n00:06:11.878 --> 00:06:15.334\nAnd if you plot a histogram\nof the number of Band-Aids we've ordered\n\n00:06:15.358 --> 00:06:17.934\nin the past, that sort of tailed off now.\n\n00:06:17.958 --> 00:06:19.918\nBecause these robots are really safe.\n\n00:06:20.718 --> 00:06:23.174\nThe small size has some disadvantages,\n\n00:06:23.198 --> 00:06:27.278\nand nature has found a number of ways\nto compensate for these disadvantages.\n\n00:06:27.918 --> 00:06:31.918\nThe basic idea is they aggregate\nto form large groups, or swarms.\n\n00:06:32.278 --> 00:06:36.254\nSo, similarly, in our lab,\nwe try to create artificial robot swarms.\n\n00:06:36.278 --> 00:06:37.659\nAnd this is quite challenging\n\n00:06:37.683 --> 00:06:41.003\nbecause now you have to think\nabout networks of robots.\n\n00:06:41.318 --> 00:06:42.614\nAnd within each robot,\n\n00:06:42.638 --> 00:06:48.254\nyou have to think about the interplay\nof sensing, communication, computation --\n\n00:06:48.278 --> 00:06:53.238\nand this network then becomes\nquite difficult to control and manage.\n\n00:06:54.118 --> 00:06:57.414\nSo from nature we take away\nthree organizing principles\n\n00:06:57.438 --> 00:07:00.598\nthat essentially allow us\nto develop our algorithms.\n\n00:07:01.598 --> 00:07:06.134\nThe first idea is that robots\nneed to be aware of their neighbors.\n\n00:07:06.158 --> 00:07:09.598\nThey need to be able to sense\nand communicate with their neighbors.\n\n00:07:09.998 --> 00:07:12.654\nSo this video illustrates the basic idea.\n\n00:07:12.678 --> 00:07:13.974\nYou have four robots --\n\n00:07:13.998 --> 00:07:18.238\none of the robots has actually been\nhijacked by a human operator, literally.\n\n00:07:19.175 --> 00:07:21.414\nBut because the robots\ninteract with each other,\n\n00:07:21.438 --> 00:07:23.094\nthey sense their neighbors,\n\n00:07:23.118 --> 00:07:24.414\nthey essentially follow.\n\n00:07:24.438 --> 00:07:29.798\nAnd here there's a single person\nable to lead this network of followers.\n\n00:07:31.958 --> 00:07:37.014\nSo again, it's not because all the robots\nknow where they're supposed to go.\n\n00:07:37.038 --> 00:07:41.358\nIt's because they're just reacting\nto the positions of their neighbors.\n\n00:07:43.678 --> 00:07:47.798\n(Laughter)\n\n00:07:48.238 --> 00:07:53.478\nSo the next experiment illustrates\nthe second organizing principle.\n\n00:07:54.878 --> 00:07:58.678\nAnd this principle has to do\nwith the principle of anonymity.\n\n00:07:59.358 --> 00:08:03.654\nHere the key idea is that\n\n00:08:03.678 --> 00:08:07.918\nthe robots are agnostic\nto the identities of their neighbors.\n\n00:08:08.398 --> 00:08:11.014\nThey're asked to form a circular shape,\n\n00:08:11.038 --> 00:08:14.334\nand no matter how many robots\nyou introduce into the formation,\n\n00:08:14.358 --> 00:08:16.934\nor how many robots you pull out,\n\n00:08:16.958 --> 00:08:20.094\neach robot is simply\nreacting to its neighbor.\n\n00:08:20.118 --> 00:08:25.094\nIt's aware of the fact that it needs\nto form the circular shape,\n\n00:08:25.118 --> 00:08:26.894\nbut collaborating with its neighbors\n\n00:08:26.918 --> 00:08:30.638\nit forms the shape\nwithout central coordination.\n\n00:08:31.478 --> 00:08:33.894\nNow if you put these ideas together,\n\n00:08:33.918 --> 00:08:37.814\nthe third idea is that we\nessentially give these robots\n\n00:08:37.838 --> 00:08:42.134\nmathematical descriptions\nof the shape they need to execute.\n\n00:08:42.158 --> 00:08:45.654\nAnd these shapes can be varying\nas a function of time,\n\n00:08:45.678 --> 00:08:50.174\nand you'll see these robots\nstart from a circular formation,\n\n00:08:50.198 --> 00:08:53.454\nchange into a rectangular formation,\nstretch into a straight line,\n\n00:08:53.478 --> 00:08:54.853\nback into an ellipse.\n\n00:08:54.877 --> 00:08:58.494\nAnd they do this with the same\nkind of split-second coordination\n\n00:08:58.518 --> 00:09:01.798\nthat you see in natural swarms, in nature.\n\n00:09:03.038 --> 00:09:05.174\nSo why work with swarms?\n\n00:09:05.198 --> 00:09:09.318\nLet me tell you about two applications\nthat we are very interested in.\n\n00:09:10.118 --> 00:09:12.494\nThe first one has to do with agriculture,\n\n00:09:12.518 --> 00:09:15.878\nwhich is probably the biggest problem\nthat we're facing worldwide.\n\n00:09:16.718 --> 00:09:17.974\nAs you well know,\n\n00:09:17.998 --> 00:09:21.518\none in every seven persons\nin this earth is malnourished.\n\n00:09:21.878 --> 00:09:25.358\nMost of the land that we can cultivate\nhas already been cultivated.\n\n00:09:25.918 --> 00:09:29.134\nAnd the efficiency of most systems\nin the world is improving,\n\n00:09:29.158 --> 00:09:32.678\nbut our production system\nefficiency is actually declining.\n\n00:09:33.038 --> 00:09:37.254\nAnd that's mostly because of water\nshortage, crop diseases, climate change\n\n00:09:37.278 --> 00:09:38.798\nand a couple of other things.\n\n00:09:39.318 --> 00:09:40.798\nSo what can robots do?\n\n00:09:41.158 --> 00:09:45.774\nWell, we adopt an approach that's\ncalled Precision Farming in the community.\n\n00:09:45.798 --> 00:09:51.174\nAnd the basic idea is that we fly\naerial robots through orchards,\n\n00:09:51.198 --> 00:09:54.318\nand then we build\nprecision models of individual plants.\n\n00:09:54.787 --> 00:09:56.454\nSo just like personalized medicine,\n\n00:09:56.478 --> 00:10:01.294\nwhile you might imagine wanting\nto treat every patient individually,\n\n00:10:01.318 --> 00:10:05.014\nwhat we'd like to do is build\nmodels of individual plants\n\n00:10:05.038 --> 00:10:09.174\nand then tell the farmer\nwhat kind of inputs every plant needs --\n\n00:10:09.198 --> 00:10:13.638\nthe inputs in this case being water,\nfertilizer and pesticide.\n\n00:10:14.598 --> 00:10:18.214\nHere you'll see robots\ntraveling through an apple orchard,\n\n00:10:18.238 --> 00:10:20.494\nand in a minute you'll see\ntwo of its companions\n\n00:10:20.518 --> 00:10:22.328\ndoing the same thing on the left side.\n\n00:10:22.758 --> 00:10:26.414\nAnd what they're doing is essentially\nbuilding a map of the orchard.\n\n00:10:26.438 --> 00:10:29.254\nWithin the map is a map\nof every plant in this orchard.\n\n00:10:29.278 --> 00:10:30.934\n(Robot buzzing)\n\n00:10:30.958 --> 00:10:32.854\nLet's see what those maps look like.\n\n00:10:32.878 --> 00:10:37.174\nIn the next video, you'll see the cameras\nthat are being used on this robot.\n\n00:10:37.198 --> 00:10:40.438\nOn the top-left is essentially\na standard color camera.\n\n00:10:41.598 --> 00:10:44.894\nOn the left-center is an infrared camera.\n\n00:10:44.918 --> 00:10:48.694\nAnd on the bottom-left\nis a thermal camera.\n\n00:10:48.718 --> 00:10:52.054\nAnd on the main panel, you're seeing\na three-dimensional reconstruction\n\n00:10:52.078 --> 00:10:58.198\nof every tree in the orchard\nas the sensors fly right past the trees.\n\n00:10:59.598 --> 00:11:03.638\nArmed with information like this,\nwe can do several things.\n\n00:11:04.158 --> 00:11:08.414\nThe first and possibly the most important\nthing we can do is very simple:\n\n00:11:08.438 --> 00:11:10.878\ncount the number of fruits on every tree.\n\n00:11:11.478 --> 00:11:16.014\nBy doing this, you tell the farmer\nhow many fruits she has in every tree\n\n00:11:16.038 --> 00:11:20.294\nand allow her to estimate\nthe yield in the orchard,\n\n00:11:20.318 --> 00:11:23.158\noptimizing the production\nchain downstream.\n\n00:11:23.598 --> 00:11:25.214\nThe second thing we can do\n\n00:11:25.238 --> 00:11:29.734\nis take models of plants, construct\nthree-dimensional reconstructions,\n\n00:11:29.758 --> 00:11:32.294\nand from that estimate the canopy size,\n\n00:11:32.318 --> 00:11:36.094\nand then correlate the canopy size\nto the amount of leaf area on every plant.\n\n00:11:36.118 --> 00:11:38.294\nAnd this is called the leaf area index.\n\n00:11:38.318 --> 00:11:40.254\nSo if you know this leaf area index,\n\n00:11:40.278 --> 00:11:45.734\nyou essentially have a measure of how much\nphotosynthesis is possible in every plant,\n\n00:11:45.758 --> 00:11:48.638\nwhich again tells you\nhow healthy each plant is.\n\n00:11:49.478 --> 00:11:53.694\nBy combining visual\nand infrared information,\n\n00:11:53.718 --> 00:11:57.014\nwe can also compute indices such as NDVI.\n\n00:11:57.038 --> 00:11:59.854\nAnd in this particular case,\nyou can essentially see\n\n00:11:59.878 --> 00:12:02.894\nthere are some crops that are\nnot doing as well as other crops.\n\n00:12:02.918 --> 00:12:06.974\nThis is easily discernible from imagery,\n\n00:12:06.998 --> 00:12:09.214\nnot just visual imagery but combining\n\n00:12:09.238 --> 00:12:12.014\nboth visual imagery and infrared imagery.\n\n00:12:12.038 --> 00:12:13.374\nAnd then lastly,\n\n00:12:13.398 --> 00:12:17.414\none thing we're interested in doing is\ndetecting the early onset of chlorosis --\n\n00:12:17.438 --> 00:12:18.934\nand this is an orange tree --\n\n00:12:18.958 --> 00:12:21.518\nwhich is essentially seen\nby yellowing of leaves.\n\n00:12:21.838 --> 00:12:25.734\nBut robots flying overhead\ncan easily spot this autonomously\n\n00:12:25.758 --> 00:12:28.694\nand then report to the farmer\nthat he or she has a problem\n\n00:12:28.718 --> 00:12:30.238\nin this section of the orchard.\n\n00:12:30.758 --> 00:12:33.454\nSystems like this can really help,\n\n00:12:33.478 --> 00:12:39.294\nand we're projecting yields\nthat can improve by about ten percent\n\n00:12:39.318 --> 00:12:42.534\nand, more importantly, decrease\nthe amount of inputs such as water\n\n00:12:42.558 --> 00:12:45.838\nby 25 percent by using\naerial robot swarms.\n\n00:12:47.158 --> 00:12:52.894\nLastly, I want you to applaud\nthe people who actually create the future,\n\n00:12:52.918 --> 00:12:57.838\nYash Mulgaonkar, Sikang Liu\nand Giuseppe Loianno,\n\n00:12:57.878 --> 00:13:01.374\nwho are responsible for the three\ndemonstrations that you saw.\n\n00:13:01.398 --> 00:13:02.574\nThank you.\n\n00:13:02.598 --> 00:13:08.518\n(Applause)"}, {"title": "Why medicine often has dangerous side effects for women", "duration": "929", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/alyson_mcgregor_why_medicine_often_has_dangerous_side_effects_for_women", "transcript": "We all go to doctors. And we do so with trust and blind faith that the test they are ordering and the medications they're prescribing are based upon evidence \u2014 evidence that's designed to help us. However, the reality is that that hasn't always been the case for everyone. What if I told you that the medical science discovered over the past century has been based on only half the population?I'm an emergency medicine doctor. I was trained to be prepared in a medical emergency. It's about saving lives. How cool is that? OK, there's a lot of runny noses and stubbed toes, but no matter who walks through the door to the ER, we order the same tests, we prescribe the same medication, without ever thinking about the sex or gender of our patients. Why would we? We were never taught that there were any differences between men and women.A recent Government Accountability study revealed that 80 percent of the drugs withdrawn from the market are due to side effects on women. So let's think about that for a minute. Why are we discovering side effects on women only after a drug has been released to the market? Do you know that it takes years for a drug to go from an idea to being tested on cells in a laboratory, to animal studies, to then clinical trials on humans, finally to go through a regulatory approval process, to be available for your doctor to prescribe to you? Not to mention the millions and billions of dollars of funding it takes to go through that process. So why are we discovering unacceptable side effects on half the population after that has gone through? What's happening?Well, it turns out that those cells used in that laboratory, they're male cells, and the animals used in the animal studies were male animals, and the clinical trials have been performed almost exclusively on men.How is it that the male model became our framework for medical research? Let's look at an example that has been popularized in the media, and it has to do with the sleep aid Ambien. Ambien was released on the market over 20 years ago, and since then, hundreds of millions of prescriptions have been written, primarily to women, because women suffer more sleep disorders than men. But just this past year, the Food and Drug Administration recommended cutting the dose in half for women only, because they just realized that women metabolize the drug at a slower rate than men, causing them to wake up in the morning with more of the active drug in their system. And then they're drowsy and they're getting behind the wheel of the car, and they're at risk for motor vehicle accidents. And I can't help but think, as an emergency physician, how many of my patients that I've cared for over the years were involved in a motor vehicle accident that possibly could have been prevented if this type of analysis was performed and acted upon 20 years ago when this drug was first released. How many other things need to be analyzed by gender? What else are we missing?World War II changed a lot of things, and one of them was this need to protect people from becoming victims of medical research without informed consent. So some much-needed guidelines or rules were set into place, and part of that was this desire to protect women of childbearing age from entering into any medical research studies. There was fear: what if something happened to the fetus during the study? Who would be responsible? And so the scientists at this time actually thought this was a blessing in disguise, because let's face it \u2014 men's bodies are pretty homogeneous. They don't have the constantly fluctuating levels of hormones that could disrupt clean data they could get if they had only men. It was easier. It was cheaper. Not to mention, at this time, there was a general assumption that men and women were alike in every way, apart from their reproductive organs and sex hormones. So it was decided: medical research was performed on men, and the results were later applied to women.What did this do to the notion of women's health? Women's health became synonymous with reproduction: breasts, ovaries, uterus, pregnancy. It's this term we now refer to as \"bikini medicine.\" And this stayed this way until about the 1980s, when this concept was challenged by the medical community and by the public health policymakers when they realized that by excluding women from all medical research studies we actually did them a disservice, in that apart from reproductive issues, virtually nothing was known about the unique needs of the female patient.Since that time, an overwhelming amount of evidence has come to light that shows us just how different men and women are in every way. You know, we have this saying in medicine: children are not just little adults. And we say that to remind ourselves that children actually have a different physiology than normal adults. And it's because of this that the medical specialty of pediatrics came to light. And we now conduct research on children in order to improve their lives. And I know the same thing can be said about women. Women are not just men with boobs and tubes. But they have their own anatomy and physiology that deserves to be studied with the same intensity.Let's take the cardiovascular system, for example. This area in medicine has done the most to try to figure out why it seems men and women have completely different heart attacks. Heart disease is the number one killer for both men and women, but more women die within the first year of having a heart attack than men. Men will complain of crushing chest pain \u2014 an elephant is sitting on their chest. And we call this typical. Women have chest pain, too. But more women than men will complain of \"just not feeling right,\" \"can't seem to get enough air in,\" \"just so tired lately.\" And for some reason we call this atypical, even though, as I mentioned, women do make up half the population.And so what is some of the evidence to help explain some of these differences? If we look at the anatomy, the blood vessels that surround the heart are smaller in women compared to men, and the way that those blood vessels develop disease is different in women compared to men. And the test that we use to determine if someone is at risk for a heart attack, well, they were initially designed and tested and perfected in men, and so aren't as good at determining that in women. And then if we think about the medications \u2014 common medications that we use, like aspirin. We give aspirin to healthy men to help prevent them from having a heart attack, but do you know that if you give aspirin to a healthy woman, it's actually harmful?What this is doing is merely telling us that we are scratching the surface. Emergency medicine is a fast-paced business. In how many life-saving areas of medicine, like cancer and stroke, are there important differences between men and women that we could be utilizing? Or even, why is it that some people get those runny noses more than others, or why the pain medication that we give to those stubbed toes work in some and not in others?The Institute of Medicine has said every cell has a sex. What does this mean? Sex is DNA. Gender is how someone presents themselves in society. And these two may not always match up, as we can see with our transgendered population. But it's important to realize that from the moment of conception, every cell in our bodies \u2014 skin, hair, heart and lungs \u2014 contains our own unique DNA, and that DNA contains the chromosomes that determine whether we become male or female, man or woman.It used to be thought that those sex-determining chromosomes pictured here \u2014 XY if you're male, XX if you're female \u2014 merely determined whether you would be born with ovaries or testes, and it was the sex hormones that those organs produced that were responsible for the differences we see in the opposite sex. But we now know that that theory was wrong \u2014 or it's at least a little incomplete. And thankfully, scientists like Dr. Page from the Whitehead Institute, who works on the Y chromosome, and Doctor Yang from UCLA, they have found evidence that tells us that those sex-determining chromosomes that are in every cell in our bodies continue to remain active for our entire lives and could be what's responsible for the differences we see in the dosing of drugs, or why there are differences between men and women in the susceptibility and severity of diseases. This new knowledge is the game-changer, and it's up to those scientists that continue to find that evidence, but it's up to the clinicians to start translating this data at the bedside, today. Right now. And to help do this, I'm a co-founder of a national organization called Sex and Gender Women's Health Collaborative, and we collect all of this data so that it's available for teaching and for patient care. And we're working to bring together the medical educators to the table. That's a big job. It's changing the way medical training has been done since its inception.But I believe in them. I know they're going to see the value of incorporating the gender lens into the current curriculum. It's about training the future health care providers correctly. And regionally, I'm a co-creator of a division within the Department of Emergency Medicine here at Brown University, called Sex and Gender in Emergency Medicine, and we conduct the research to determine the differences between men and women in emergent conditions, like heart disease and stroke and sepsis and substance abuse, but we also believe that education is paramount.We've created a 360-degree model of education. We have programs for the doctors, for the nurses, for the students and for the patients. Because this cannot just be left up to the health care leaders. We all have a role in making a difference. But I must warn you: this is not easy. In fact, it's hard. It's essentially changing the way we think about medicine and health and research. It's changing our relationship to the health care system. But there's no going back. We now know just enough to know that we weren't doing it right.Martin Luther King, Jr. has said, \"Change does not roll in on the wheels of inevitability, but comes through continuous struggle.\"And the first step towards change is awareness. This is not just about improving medical care for women. This is about personalized, individualized health care for everyone. This awareness has the power to transform medical care for men and women. And from now on, I want you to ask your doctors whether the treatments you are receiving are specific to your sex and gender. They may not know the answer \u2014 yet. But the conversation has begun, and together we can all learn. Remember, for me and my colleagues in this field, your sex and gender matter.Thank you.(Applause)", "id": 2349, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:12.774 --> 00:00:15.346\nWe all go to doctors.\n\n00:00:16.902 --> 00:00:21.240\nAnd we do so with trust and blind faith\n\n00:00:21.264 --> 00:00:25.122\nthat the test they are ordering\nand the medications they're prescribing\n\n00:00:25.146 --> 00:00:28.321\nare based upon evidence --\n\n00:00:28.345 --> 00:00:31.272\nevidence that's designed to help us.\n\n00:00:32.296 --> 00:00:38.139\nHowever, the reality is that that hasn't\nalways been the case for everyone.\n\n00:00:39.044 --> 00:00:40.339\nWhat if I told you\n\n00:00:40.363 --> 00:00:44.309\nthat the medical science discovered\nover the past century\n\n00:00:44.333 --> 00:00:48.000\nhas been based on only\nhalf the population?\n\n00:00:48.024 --> 00:00:50.318\nI'm an emergency medicine doctor.\n\n00:00:50.707 --> 00:00:54.358\nI was trained to be prepared\nin a medical emergency.\n\n00:00:54.898 --> 00:00:59.347\nIt's about saving lives.

00:01:31.927\nare due to side effects on women.\n\n00:01:33.038 --> 00:01:35.349\nSo let's think about that for a minute.\n\n00:01:35.373 --> 00:01:39.247\nWhy are we discovering\nside effects on

idea\n\n00:01:49.138 --> 00:01:52.295\nto being tested on cells in a laboratory,\n\n00:01:52.319 --> 00:01:54.287\nto animal studies,\n\n00:01:54.311 --> 00:01:56.438\nto then clinical trials on

00:02:28.839\nWell, it turns out that those cells\nused in that laboratory,\n\n00:02:28.863 --> 00:02:30.793\nthey're male cells,\n\n00:02:30.817 --> 00:02:34.219\nand the animals used\nin the animal studies were male animals,\n\n00:02:34.243 --> 00:02:39.333\nand the clinical trials have been\nperformed almost exclusively on men.\n\n00:02:41.134 --> 00:02:46.488\nHow is it that the male model became\nour framework for medical research?\n\n00:02:46.512 --> 00:02:50.583\nLet's look at an example that has been\npopularized in the media,\n\n00:02:50.607 --> 00:02:53.813\nand it has to do\nwith the sleep aid Ambien.\n\n00:02:53.837 --> 00:02:58.601\nAmbien was released on the market\nover 20 years ago,\n\n00:02:58.625 --> 00:03:03.438\nand since then, hundreds of millions\nof prescriptions have been written,\n\n00:03:03.462 --> 00:03:07.910\nprimarily to women, because women\nsuffer more sleep disorders than men.\n\n00:03:09.005 --> 00:03:11.181\nBut just this past year,\n\n00:03:11.205 --> 00:03:14.629\nthe Food and Drug Administration\nrecommended cutting the dose in half\n\n00:03:14.653 --> 00:03:17.540\nfor women only,\n\n00:03:17.564 --> 00:03:20.401\nbecause they just realized\nthat women metabolize the drug\n\n00:03:20.425 --> 00:03:23.338\nat a slower rate than men,\n\n00:03:23.362 --> 00:03:25.401\ncausing them to wake up in the morning\n\n00:03:25.425 --> 00:03:28.619\nwith more of the active drug\nin their system.\n\n00:03:28.643 --> 00:03:32.573\nAnd then they're drowsy and they're\ngetting behind the wheel of the car,\n\n00:03:32.597 --> 00:03:35.564\nand they're at risk\nfor motor vehicle accidents.\n\n00:03:36.913 --> 00:03:40.857\nAnd I can't help but think,\nas an emergency physician,\n\n00:03:40.881 --> 00:03:45.674\nhow many of my patients\nthat I've cared for over the years\n\n00:03:45.698 --> 00:03:48.504\nwere involved in a motor vehicle accident\n\n00:03:48.528 --> 00:03:51.980\nthat possibly could have been

woman,\n\n00:09:08.534 --> 00:09:10.120\nit's actually harmful?\n\n00:09:12.334 --> 00:09:14.716\nWhat this is doing is merely telling us\n\n00:09:14.740 --> 00:09:17.492\nthat we are scratching the

toes\n\n00:09:46.598 --> 00:09:49.803\nwork in some and not in others?\n\n00:09:53.246 --> 00:09:58.476\nThe Institute of Medicine has said\nevery cell has a sex.\n\n00:09:59.778 --> 00:10:01.191\nWhat does this mean?\n\n00:10:02.490 --> 00:10:04.888\nSex is DNA.\n\n00:10:04.912 --> 00:10:09.253\nGender is how someone\npresents themselves in society.\n\n00:10:09.841 --> 00:10:12.381\nAnd these two may not always match up,\n\n00:10:12.405 --> 00:10:15.571\nas we can see with our\ntransgendered population.\n\n00:10:16.698 --> 00:10:21.613\nBut it's important to realize\nthat from the moment of conception,\n\n00:10:21.637 --> 00:10:23.759\nevery cell in our bodies --\n\n00:10:23.783 --> 00:10:27.084\nskin, hair, heart and lungs --\n\n00:10:27.108 --> 00:10:30.395\ncontains our own unique DNA,\n\n00:10:30.419 --> 00:10:34.170\nand that DNA contains\nthe chromosomes that determine\n\n00:10:34.194 --> 00:10:39.255\nwhether we become\nmale or female, man or woman.\n\n00:10:40.358 --> 00:10:41.946\nIt used to be thought\n\n00:10:41.970 --> 00:10:46.298\nthat those sex-determining\nchromosomes pictured here --\n\n00:10:46.322 --> 00:10:49.695\nXY if you're male, XX if you're female --\n\n00:10:49.719 --> 00:10:54.933\nmerely determined whether you\nwould be born with ovaries or testes,\n\n00:10:54.957 --> 00:10:58.698\nand it was the sex hormones\nthat those organs produced\n\n00:10:58.722 --> 00:11:03.287\nthat were responsible for the differences\nwe see in the opposite sex.\n\n00:11:04.715 --> 00:11:09.549\nBut we now know that\nthat theory was wrong --\n\n00:11:09.573 --> 00:11:12.018\nor it's at least a little incomplete.\n\n00:11:12.042 --> 00:11:16.820\nAnd thankfully, scientists like Dr. Page\nfrom the Whitehead Institute,\n\n00:11:16.844 --> 00:11:18.818\nwho works on the Y chromosome,\n\n00:11:18.842 --> 00:11:21.009\nand Doctor Yang from UCLA,\n\n00:11:21.033 --> 00:11:26.692\nthey have found evidence that tells us\nthat those sex-determining chromosomes\n\n00:11:26.716 --> 00:11:29.313\nthat are in every cell in our bodies\n\n00:11:29.337 --> 00:11:34.696\ncontinue to remain active\nfor our entire lives\n\n00:11:36.475 --> 00:11:40.050\nand could be what's responsible\nfor the differences we see\n\n00:11:40.074 --> 00:11:42.289\nin the dosing of drugs,\n\n00:11:42.313 --> 00:11:45.279\nor why there are differences\nbetween men and women\n\n00:11:45.303 --> 00:11:48.819\nin the susceptibility\nand severity of diseases.\n\n00:11:50.990 --> 00:11:53.910\nThis new knowledge is the game-changer,\n\n00:11:57.383 --> 00:12:00.757\nand it's up to those scientists\nthat continue to find that evidence,\n\n00:12:00.781 --> 00:12:04.934\nbut it's up to the clinicians\nto start translating this data\n\n00:12:04.958 --> 00:12:07.957\nat the bedside, today.\n\n00:12:09.126 --> 00:12:10.282\nRight now.\n\n00:12:13.408 --> 00:12:16.432\nAnd to help do this, I'm a co-founder\nof a national organization\n\n00:12:16.456 --> 00:12:19.439\ncalled Sex and Gender\nWomen's Health Collaborative,\n\n00:12:19.463 --> 00:12:24.083\nand we collect all of this data\nso that it's available for teaching\n\n00:12:24.107 --> 00:12:25.512\nand for patient care.\n\n00:12:26.338 --> 00:12:30.706\nAnd we're working to bring together\nthe medical educators to the table.\n\n00:12:31.714 --> 00:12:33.182\nThat's a big job.\n\n00:12:34.120 --> 00:12:39.259\nIt's changing the way medical training\nhas been done since its inception.\n\n00:12:40.997 --> 00:12:42.840\nBut I believe in them.\n\n00:12:43.840 --> 00:12:49.437\nI know they're going to see the value\nof incorporating the gender lens\n\n00:12:49.461 --> 00:12:51.183\ninto the current curriculum.\n\n00:12:52.556 --> 00:12:57.174\nIt's about training the future\nhealth care providers correctly.\n\n00:13:00.395 --> 00:13:01.546\nAnd regionally,\n\n00:13:01.570 --> 00:13:05.431\nI'm a co-creator of a division within\nthe Department of Emergency Medicine\n\n00:13:05.455 --> 00:13:07.175\nhere at Brown University,\n\n00:13:07.199 --> 00:13:09.809\ncalled Sex and Gender\nin Emergency Medicine,\n\n00:13:09.833 --> 00:13:14.459\nand we conduct the research to determine\nthe differences between men and women\n\n00:13:14.483 --> 00:13:16.641\nin emergent conditions,\n\n00:13:16.665 --> 00:13:21.933\nlike heart disease and stroke\nand sepsis and substance abuse,\n\n00:13:21.957 --> 00:13:26.334\nbut we also believe\nthat education is paramount.\n\n00:13:27.262 --> 00:13:31.263\nWe've created a 360-degree\nmodel of education.\n\n00:13:31.287 --> 00:13:37.245\nWe have programs for the doctors,\nfor the nurses, for the students\n\n00:13:37.269 --> 00:13:38.975\nand for the patients.\n\n00:13:39.469 --> 00:13:43.527\nBecause this cannot just be left up\nto the health care leaders.\n\n00:13:44.273 --> 00:13:47.750\nWe all have a role in making a difference.\n\n00:13:48.608 --> 00:13:52.465\nBut I must warn you: this is not easy.\n\n00:13:53.798 --> 00:13:55.390\nIn fact, it's hard.\n\n00:13:57.104 --> 00:14:01.496\nIt's essentially changing the way\nwe think about medicine\n\n00:14:01.520 --> 00:14:04.517\nand health and research.\n\n00:14:05.669 --> 00:14:08.805\nIt's changing our relationship\nto the health care system.\n\n00:14:09.718 --> 00:14:12.606\nBut there's no going back.\n\n00:14:13.297 --> 00:14:16.996\nWe now know just enough\n\n00:14:17.020 --> 00:14:19.376\nto know that we weren't doing it right.\n\n00:14:21.630 --> 00:14:23.948\nMartin Luther King, Jr. has said,\n\n00:14:23.972 --> 00:14:28.621\n\"Change does not roll in\non the wheels of inevitability,\n\n00:14:28.645 --> 00:14:30.819\nbut comes through continuous struggle.\"\n\n00:14:32.272 --> 00:14:35.002\nAnd the first step\ntowards change is awareness.\n\n00:14:36.074 --> 00:14:40.152\nThis is not just about improving\nmedical care for women.\n\n00:14:40.660 --> 00:14:45.619\nThis is about personalized,\nindividualized health care for everyone.\n\n00:14:47.048 --> 00:14:53.150\nThis awareness has the power to transform\nmedical care for men and women.\n\n00:14:54.785 --> 00:15:00.473\nAnd from now on, I want you\nto ask your doctors\n\n00:15:00.497 --> 00:15:04.774\nwhether the treatments you are receiving\nare specific to your sex and gender.\n\n00:15:06.204 --> 00:15:08.893\nThey may not know the answer --\n\n00:15:08.917 --> 00:15:10.083\nyet.\n\n00:15:11.059 --> 00:15:14.921\nBut the conversation has begun,\nand together we can all learn.\n\n00:15:15.755 --> 00:15:20.132\nRemember, for me\nand my colleagues in this field,\n\n00:15:20.156 --> 00:15:22.433\nyour sex and gender matter.\n\n00:15:23.337 --> 00:15:24.489\nThank you.\n\n00:15:24.513 --> 00:15:28.957\n(Applause)"}, {"title": "Two nameless bodies washed up on the beach. Here are their stories", "duration": "881", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/anders_fjellberg_two_nameless_bodies_washed_up_on_the_beach_here_are_their_stories", "transcript": "So this right here is the tiny village of Elle, close to Lista. It's right at the southernmost tip of Norway. And on January 2 this year, an elderly guy who lives in the village, he went out to see what was cast ashore during a recent storm. And on a patch of grass right next to the water's edge, he found a wetsuit. It was grey and black, and he thought it looked cheap. Out of each leg of the wetsuit there were sticking two white bones. It was clearly the remains of a human being.And usually, in Norway, dead people are identified quickly. So the police started searching through missing reports from the local area, national missing reports, and looked for accidents with a possible connection. They found nothing. So they ran a DNA profile, and they started searching internationally through Interpol. Nothing. This was a person that nobody seemed to be missing. It was an invisible life heading for a nameless grave. But then, after a month, the police in Norway got a message from the police in the Netherlands. A couple of months earlier, they had found a body, in an identical wetsuit, and they had no idea who this person was. But the police in the Netherlands managed to trace the wetsuit by an RFID chip that was sewn in the suit. So they were then able to tell that both wetsuits were bought by the same customer at the same time, October 7, 2014, in the French city of Calais by the English Channel. But this was all they were able to figure out. The customer paid cash. There was no surveillance footage from the shop. So it became a cold case.We heard this story, and it triggered me and my colleague, photographer Tomm Christiansen, and we of course had the obvious question: who were these people? At the time, I'd barely heard about Calais, but it took about two or three seconds to figure out Calais is basically known for two things. It's the spot in continental Europe closest to Britain, and a lot of migrants and refugees are staying in this camp and are trying desperately to cross over to Britain. And right there was a plausible theory about the identity of the two people, and the police made this theory as well. Because if you or I or anybody else with a firm connection to Europe goes missing off the coast of France, people would just know. Your friends or family would report you missing, the police would come search for you, the media would know, and there would be pictures of you on lampposts. It's difficult to disappear without a trace. But if you just fled the war in Syria, and your family, if you have any family left, don't necessarily know where you are, and you're staying here illegally amongst thousands of others who come and go every day. Well, if you disappear one day, nobody will notice. The police won't come search for you because nobody knows you're gone.And this is what happened to Shadi Omar Kataf and Mouaz Al Balkhi from Syria.Me and Tomm went to Calais for the first time in April this year, and after three months of investigation, we were able to tell the story about how these two young men fled the war in Syria, ended up stuck in Calais, bought wetsuits and drowned in what seems to have been an attempt to swim across the English Channel in order to reach England. It is a story about the fact that everybody has a name, everybody has a story, everybody is someone. But it is also a story about what it's like to be a refugee in Europe today.So this is where we started our search. This is in Calais. Right now, between 3,500 and 5,000 people are living here under horrible conditions. It has been dubbed the worst refugee camp in Europe. Limited access to food, limited access to water, limited access to health care. Disease and infections are widespread. And they're all stuck here because they're trying to get to England in order to claim asylum. And they do that by hiding in the back of trucks headed for the ferry, or the Eurotunnel, or they sneak inside the tunnel terminal at night to try to hide on the trains.Most want to go to Britain because they know the language, and so they figure it would be easier to restart their lives from there. They want to work, they want to study, they want to be able to continue their lives. A lot of these people are highly educated and skilled workers. If you go to Calais and talk to refugees, you'll meet lawyers, politicians, engineers, graphic designers, farmers, soldiers. You've got the whole spectrum. But who all of these people are usually gets lost in the way we talk about refugees and migrants, because we usually do that in statistics.So you have 60 million refugees globally. About half a million have made the crossing over the Mediterranean into Europe so far this year, and roughly 4,000 are staying in Calais. But these are numbers, and the numbers don't say anything about who these people are, where they came from, or why they're here.And first, I want to tell you about one of them. This is 22-year-old Mouaz Al Balkhi from Syria. We first heard about him after being in Calais the first time looking for answers to the theory of the two dead bodies. And after a while, we heard this story about a Syrian man who was living in Bradford in England, and had been desperately searching for his nephew Mouaz for months. And it turned out the last time anybody had heard anything from Mouaz was October 7, 2014. That was the same date the wetsuits were bought. So we flew over there and we met the uncle and we did DNA samples of him, and later on got additional DNA samples from Mouaz's closest relative who now lives in Jordan. The analysis concluded the body who was found in a wetsuit on a beach in the Netherlands was actually Mouaz Al Balkhi. And while we were doing all this investigation, we got to know Mouaz's story. He was born in the Syrian capital of Damascus in 1991. He was raised in a middle class family, and his father in the middle there is a chemical engineer who spent 11 years in prison for belonging to the political opposition in Syria. While his father was in prison, Mouaz took responsibility and he cared for his three sisters. They said he was that kind of guy. Mouaz studied to become an electrical engineer at the University of Damascus.So a couple of years into the Syrian war, the family fled Damascus and went to the neighboring country, Jordan. Their father had problems finding work in Jordan, and Mouaz could not continue his studies, so he figured, \"OK, the best thing I can do to help my family would be to go somewhere where I can finish my studies and find work.\" So he goes to Turkey.In Turkey, he's not accepted at a university, and once he had left Jordan as a refugee, he was not allowed to reenter. So then he decides to head for the UK, where his uncle lives. He makes it into Algeria, walks into Libya, pays a people smuggler to help him with the crossing into Italy by boat, and from there on he heads to Dunkirk, the city right next to Calais by the English Channel. We know he made at least 12 failed attempts to cross the English Channel by hiding in a truck. But at some point, he must have given up all hope. The last night we know he was alive, he spent at a cheap hotel close to the train station in Dunkirk. We found his name in the records, and he seems to have stayed there alone. The day after, he went into Calais, entered a sports shop a couple of minutes before 8 o'clock in the evening, along with Shadi Kataf. They both bought wetsuits, and the woman in the shop was the last person we know of to have seen them alive. We have tried to figure out where Shadi met Mouaz, but we weren't able to do that. But they do have a similar story. We first heard about Shadi after a cousin of his, living in Germany, had read an Arabic translation of the story made of Mouaz on Facebook. So we got in touch with him. Shadi, a couple of years older than Mouaz, was also raised in Damascus. He was a working kind of guy. He ran a tire repair shop and later worked in a printing company. He lived with his extended family, but their house got bombed early in the war. So the family fled to an area of Damascus known as Camp Yarmouk.Yarmouk is being described as the worst place to live on planet Earth. They've been bombed by the military, they've been besieged, they've been stormed by ISIS and they've been cut off from supplies for years. There was a UN official who visited last year, and he said, \"They ate all the grass so there was no grass left.\" Out of a population of 150,000, only 18,000 are believed to still be left in Yarmouk. Shadi and his sisters got out. The parents are still stuck inside.So Shadi and one of his sisters, they fled to Libya. This was after the fall of Gaddafi, but before Libya turned into full-blown civil war. And in this last remaining sort of stability in Libya, Shadi took up scuba diving, and he seemed to spend most of his time underwater. He fell completely in love with the ocean, so when he finally decided that he could no longer be in Libya, late August 2014, he hoped to find work as a diver when he reached Italy. Reality was not that easy. We don't know much about his travels because he had a hard time communicating with his family, but we do know that he struggled. And by the end of September, he was living on the streets somewhere in France. On October 7, he calls his cousin in Belgium, and explains his situation. He said, \"I'm in Calais. I need you to come get my backpack and my laptop. I can't afford to pay the people smugglers to help me with the crossing to Britain, but I will go buy a wetsuit and I will swim.\" His cousin, of course, tried to warn him not to, but Shadi's battery on the phone went flat, and his phone was never switched on again. What was left of Shadi was found nearly three months later, 800 kilometers away in a wetsuit on a beach in Norway. He's still waiting for his funeral in Norway, and none of his family will be able to attend.Many may think that the story about Shadi and Mouaz is a story about death, but I don't agree. To me, this is a story about two questions that I think we all share: what is a better life, and what am I willing to do to achieve it? And to me, and probably a lot of you, a better life would mean being able to do more of what we think of as meaningful, whether that be spending more time with your family and friends, travel to an exotic place, or just getting money to buy that cool new device or a pair of new sneakers. And this is all within our reach pretty easily.But if you are fleeing a war zone, the answers to those two questions are dramatically different. A better life is a life in safety. It's a life in dignity. A better life means not having your house bombed, not fearing being kidnapped. It means being able to send your children to school, go to university, or just find work to be able to provide for yourself and the ones you love. A better life would be a future of some possibilities compared to nearly none, and that's a strong motivation. And I have no trouble imagining that after spending weeks or even months as a second-grade citizen, living on the streets or in a horrible makeshift camp with a stupid, racist name like \"The Jungle,\" most of us would be willing to do just about anything. If I could ask Shadi and Mouaz the second they stepped into the freezing waters of the English Channel, they would probably say, \"This is worth the risk,\" because they could no longer see any other option. And that's desperation, but that's the reality of living as a refugee in Western Europe in 2015.Thank you.(Applause)Bruno Giussani: Thank you, Anders. This is Tomm Christiansen, who took most of the pictures you have seen and they've done reporting together. Tomm, you two have been back to Calais recently. This was the third trip. It was after the publication of the article. What has changed? What have you seen there?Tomm Christiansen: The first time we were in Calais, it was about 1,500 refugees there. They had a difficult time, but they were positive, they had hope. The last time, the camp has grown, maybe four or five thousand people. It seemed more permanent, NGOs have arrived, a small school has opened. But the thing is that the refugees have stayed for a longer time, and the French government has managed to seal off the borders better, so now The Jungle is growing, along with the despair and hopelessness among the refugees.BG: Are you planning to go back? And continue the reporting?TC: Yes.BG: Anders, I'm a former journalist, and to me, it's amazing that in the current climate of slashing budgets and publishers in crisis, Dagbladet has consented so many resources for this story, which tells a lot about newspapers taking the responsibility, but how did you sell it to your editors?Anders Fjellberg: It wasn't easy at first, because we weren't able to know what we actually could figure out. As soon as it became clear that we actually could be able to identify who the first one was, we basically got the message that we could do whatever we wanted, just travel wherever you need to go, do whatever you need to do, just get this done.BG: That's an editor taking responsibility. The story, by the way, has been translated and published across several European countries, and certainly will continue to do. And we want to read the updates from you. Thank you Anders.

identical wetsuit,\nand they had no idea who this person was.\n\n00:01:37.749 --> 00:01:40.654\nBut the police in the Netherlands\nmanaged to trace the wetsuit\n\n00:01:40.678 --> 00:01:44.054\nby an RFID chip that was sewn in the suit.\n\n00:01:44.078 --> 00:01:46.254\nSo they were then able to tell\n\n00:01:46.278 --> 00:01:51.614\nthat both wetsuits were bought\nby the same customer at the same time,\n\n00:01:51.638 --> 00:01:54.094\nOctober 7, 2014,\n\n00:01:54.118 --> 00:01:56.718\nin the French city of Calais\nby the English Channel.\n\n00:01:57.718 --> 00:02:00.894\nBut this was all\nthey were able to figure out.\n\n00:02:00.918 --> 00:02:02.574\nThe customer paid cash.\n\n00:02:02.598 --> 00:02:05.214\nThere was no surveillance\nfootage from the shop.\n\n00:02:05.238 --> 00:02:06.718\nSo it became a cold case.\n\n00:02:07.798 --> 00:02:09.014\nWe heard this story,\n\n00:02:09.038 --> 00:02:12.277\nand it triggered me and my colleague,\nphotographer Tomm Christiansen,\n\n00:02:12.301 --> 00:02:15.374\nand we of course had the obvious question:\nwho were these people?\n\n00:02:15.398 --> 00:02:17.398\nAt the time, I'd barely\nheard about Calais,\n\n00:02:17.422 --> 00:02:20.253\nbut it took about two\nor three seconds to figure out\n\n00:02:20.278 --> 00:02:23.214\nCalais is basically known for two things.\n\n00:02:23.238 --> 00:02:26.054\nIt's the spot in continental Europe\nclosest to Britain,\n\n00:02:26.078 --> 00:02:29.614\nand a lot of migrants and refugees\nare staying in this camp\n\n00:02:29.638 --> 00:02:32.854\nand are trying desperately\nto cross over to Britain.\n\n00:02:32.878 --> 00:02:37.814\nAnd right there was a plausible theory\nabout the identity of the two people,\n\n00:02:37.838 --> 00:02:40.214\nand the police made this theory as well.\n\n00:02:40.238 --> 00:02:43.429\nBecause if you or I or anybody else\nwith a firm connection to Europe\n\n00:02:43.453 --> 00:02:46.654\ngoes missing off the coast of France,\npeople would just know.\n\n00:02:46.678 --> 00:02:48.934\nYour friends or family\nwould report you missing,\n\n00:02:48.958 --> 00:02:51.734\nthe police would come search for you,\nthe media would know,\n\n00:02:51.758 --> 00:02:54.014\nand there would be\npictures of you on lampposts.\n\n00:02:54.038 --> 00:02:56.086\nIt's difficult to disappear\nwithout a trace.\n\n00:02:57.078 --> 00:02:58.934\nBut if you just fled the war in Syria,\n\n00:02:58.958 --> 00:03:01.934\nand your family,\nif you have any family left,\n\n00:03:01.958 --> 00:03:04.014\ndon't necessarily know where you are,\n\n00:03:04.038 --> 00:03:06.054\nand you're staying here illegally\n\n00:03:06.078 --> 00:03:08.918\namongst thousands of others\nwho come and go every day.\n\n00:03:09.398 --> 00:03:13.078\nWell, if you disappear one day,\nnobody will notice.\n\n00:03:13.558 --> 00:03:16.844\nThe police won't come search for you\nbecause nobody knows you're gone.\n\n00:03:18.118 --> 00:03:20.854\nAnd this is what happened\nto Shadi Omar Kataf\n\n00:03:20.878 --> 00:03:23.198\nand Mouaz Al Balkhi from Syria.\n\n00:03:24.726 --> 00:03:27.774\nMe and Tomm went to Calais\nfor the first time in April this year,\n\n00:03:27.798 --> 00:03:31.134\nand after three months of investigation,\nwe were able to tell the story\n\n00:03:31.158 --> 00:03:33.934\nabout how these two young men\nfled the war in Syria,\n\n00:03:33.958 --> 00:03:35.694\nended up stuck in Calais,\n\n00:03:35.718 --> 00:03:39.094\nbought wetsuits and drowned\nin what seems to have been an attempt\n\n00:03:39.118 --> 00:03:42.078\nto swim across the English Channel\nin order to reach England.\n\n00:03:43.238 --> 00:03:46.454\nIt is a story about the fact\nthat everybody has a name,\n\n00:03:46.478 --> 00:03:48.918\neverybody has a story,\neverybody is someone.\n\n00:03:49.438 --> 00:03:55.054\nBut it is also a story about what\nit's like to be a refugee in Europe today.\n\n00:03:55.078 --> 00:03:57.014\nSo this is where we started our search.\n\n00:03:57.038 --> 00:03:58.534\nThis is in Calais.\n\n00:03:58.558 --> 00:04:01.654\nRight now, between 3,500\nand 5,000 people are living here\n\n00:04:01.678 --> 00:04:03.254\nunder horrible conditions.\n\n00:04:03.278 --> 00:04:06.254\nIt has been dubbed\nthe worst refugee camp in Europe.\n\n00:04:06.278 --> 00:04:09.334\nLimited access to food,\nlimited access to water,\n\n00:04:09.358 --> 00:04:10.854\nlimited access to health care.\n\n00:04:10.878 --> 00:04:13.158\nDisease and infections are widespread.\n\n00:04:13.878 --> 00:04:17.054\nAnd they're all stuck here\nbecause they're trying to get to England\n\n00:04:17.078 --> 00:04:18.494\nin order to claim asylum.\n\n00:04:18.518 --> 00:04:22.054\nAnd they do that by hiding in the back\nof trucks headed for the ferry,\n\n00:04:22.078 --> 00:04:23.278\nor the Eurotunnel,\n\n00:04:24.398 --> 00:04:26.734\nor they sneak inside\nthe tunnel terminal at night\n\n00:04:26.758 --> 00:04:28.638\nto try to hide on the trains.\n\n00:04:29.477 --> 00:04:32.414\nMost want to go to Britain\nbecause they know the language,\n\n00:04:32.438 --> 00:04:35.934\nand so they figure it would be easier\nto restart their lives from there.\n\n00:04:35.958 --> 00:04:37.774\nThey want to work, they want to study,\n\n00:04:37.798 --> 00:04:39.934\nthey want to be able\nto continue their lives.\n\n00:04:39.958 --> 00:04:42.894\nA lot of these people are\nhighly educated and skilled workers.\n\n00:04:42.918 --> 00:04:46.454\nIf you go to Calais and talk to refugees,\nyou'll meet lawyers, politicians,\n\n00:04:46.478 --> 00:04:49.134\nengineers, graphic designers,\nfarmers, soldiers.\n\n00:04:49.158 --> 00:04:50.587\nYou've got the whole spectrum.\n\n00:04:51.478 --> 00:04:53.854\nBut who all of these people are\n\n00:04:53.878 --> 00:04:58.334\nusually gets lost in the way\nwe talk about refugees and migrants,\n\n00:04:58.358 --> 00:05:01.374\nbecause we usually do that in statistics.\n\n00:05:01.398 --> 00:05:03.574\nSo you have 60 million refugees globally.\n\n00:05:03.598 --> 00:05:05.614\nAbout half a million\nhave made the crossing\n\n00:05:05.638 --> 00:05:08.094\nover the Mediterranean\ninto Europe so far this year,\n\n00:05:08.118 --> 00:05:10.374\nand roughly 4,000 are staying in Calais.\n\n00:05:10.398 --> 00:05:11.894\nBut these are numbers,\n\n00:05:11.918 --> 00:05:15.734\nand the numbers don't say anything\nabout who these people are,\n\n00:05:15.758 --> 00:05:18.238\nwhere they came from, or why they're here.\n\n00:05:19.598 --> 00:05:21.837\nAnd first, I want to tell you\nabout one of them.\n\n00:05:22.478 --> 00:05:26.054\nThis is 22-year-old\nMouaz Al Balkhi from Syria.\n\n00:05:26.078 --> 00:05:28.974\nWe first heard about him\nafter being in Calais the first time\n\n00:05:28.998 --> 00:05:31.774\nlooking for answers to the theory\nof the two dead bodies.\n\n00:05:31.798 --> 00:05:33.934\nAnd after a while, we heard this story\n\n00:05:33.958 --> 00:05:37.254\nabout a Syrian man\nwho was living in Bradford in England,\n\n00:05:37.278 --> 00:05:41.054\nand had been desperately searching\nfor his nephew Mouaz for months.\n\n00:05:41.078 --> 00:05:45.054\nAnd it turned out the last time\nanybody had heard anything from Mouaz\n\n00:05:45.078 --> 00:05:47.734\nwas October 7, 2014.\n\n00:05:47.758 --> 00:05:50.318\nThat was the same date\nthe wetsuits were bought.\n\n00:05:51.198 --> 00:05:53.334\nSo we flew over there and we met the uncle\n\n00:05:53.358 --> 00:05:55.454\nand we did DNA samples of him,\n\n00:05:55.478 --> 00:05:58.774\nand later on got additional DNA samples\nfrom Mouaz's closest relative\n\n00:05:58.798 --> 00:05:59.998\nwho now lives in Jordan.\n\n00:06:00.558 --> 00:06:02.654\nThe analysis concluded\n\n00:06:02.678 --> 00:06:06.174\nthe body who was found in a wetsuit\non a beach in the Netherlands\n\n00:06:06.198 --> 00:06:08.118\nwas actually Mouaz Al Balkhi.\n\n00:06:09.678 --> 00:06:12.174\nAnd while we were doing\nall this investigation,\n\n00:06:12.198 --> 00:06:14.038\nwe got to know Mouaz's story.\n\n00:06:15.278 --> 00:06:19.174\nHe was born in the Syrian capital\nof Damascus in 1991.\n\n00:06:19.198 --> 00:06:21.056\nHe was raised in a middle class family,\n\n00:06:21.080 --> 00:06:23.747\nand his father in the middle there\nis a chemical engineer\n\n00:06:23.771 --> 00:06:28.054\nwho spent 11 years in prison for belonging\nto the political opposition in Syria.\n\n00:06:28.078 --> 00:06:29.694\nWhile his father was in prison,\n\n00:06:29.718 --> 00:06:32.974\nMouaz took responsibility\nand he cared for his three sisters.\n\n00:06:32.998 --> 00:06:34.974\nThey said he was that kind of guy.\n\n00:06:34.998 --> 00:06:37.774\nMouaz studied to become\nan electrical engineer\n\n00:06:37.798 --> 00:06:40.374\nat the University of Damascus.\n\n00:06:40.398 --> 00:06:42.374\nSo a couple of years into the Syrian war,\n\n00:06:42.398 --> 00:06:46.534\nthe family fled Damascus and went\nto the neighboring country, Jordan.\n\n00:06:46.558 --> 00:06:49.094\nTheir father had problems\nfinding work in Jordan,\n\n00:06:49.118 --> 00:06:51.094\nand Mouaz could not continue his studies,\n\n00:06:51.118 --> 00:06:54.414\nso he figured, \"OK, the best thing\nI can do to help my family\n\n00:06:54.438 --> 00:06:57.174\nwould be to go somewhere\nwhere I can finish my studies\n\n00:06:57.198 --> 00:06:58.734\nand find work.\"\n\n00:06:58.758 --> 00:07:00.174\nSo he goes to Turkey.\n\n00:07:00.198 --> 00:07:02.838\nIn Turkey, he's not accepted\nat a university,\n\n00:07:03.398 --> 00:07:08.174\nand once he had left Jordan as a refugee,\nhe was not allowed to reenter.\n\n00:07:08.198 --> 00:07:10.814\nSo then he decides to head for the UK,\n\n00:07:10.838 --> 00:07:12.374\nwhere his uncle lives.\n\n00:07:12.398 --> 00:07:15.534\nHe makes it into Algeria,\nwalks into Libya,\n\n00:07:15.558 --> 00:07:19.374\npays a people smuggler to help him\nwith the crossing into Italy by boat,\n\n00:07:19.398 --> 00:07:21.294\nand from there on he heads to Dunkirk,\n\n00:07:21.318 --> 00:07:23.998\nthe city right next to Calais\nby the English Channel.\n\n00:07:25.913 --> 00:07:29.294\nWe know he made at least 12 failed\nattempts to cross the English Channel\n\n00:07:29.318 --> 00:07:30.918\nby hiding in a truck.\n\n00:07:31.478 --> 00:07:34.158\nBut at some point,\nhe must have given up all hope.\n\n00:07:35.318 --> 00:07:37.374\nThe last night we know he was alive,\n\n00:07:37.398 --> 00:07:40.918\nhe spent at a cheap hotel\nclose to the train station in Dunkirk.\n\n00:07:41.478 --> 00:07:44.955\nWe found his name in the records,\nand he seems to have stayed there alone.\n\n00:07:45.638 --> 00:07:49.574\nThe day after, he went into Calais,\nentered a sports shop\n\n00:07:49.598 --> 00:07:52.054\na couple of minutes\nbefore 8 o'clock in the evening,\n\n00:07:52.078 --> 00:07:53.614\nalong with Shadi Kataf.\n\n00:07:53.638 --> 00:07:55.654\nThey both bought wetsuits,\n\n00:07:55.678 --> 00:07:57.094\nand the woman in the shop\n\n00:07:57.118 --> 00:07:59.690\nwas the last person we know of\nto have seen them alive.\n\n00:08:01.718 --> 00:08:05.014\nWe have tried to figure out\nwhere Shadi met Mouaz,\n\n00:08:05.038 --> 00:08:07.454\nbut we weren't able to do that.\n\n00:08:07.478 --> 00:08:09.574\nBut they do have a similar story.\n\n00:08:09.598 --> 00:08:13.494\nWe first heard about Shadi\nafter a cousin of his, living in Germany,\n\n00:08:13.518 --> 00:08:17.974\nhad read an Arabic translation\nof the story made of Mouaz on Facebook.\n\n00:08:17.998 --> 00:08:19.332\nSo we got in touch with him.\n\n00:08:20.878 --> 00:08:23.414\nShadi, a couple of years older than Mouaz,\n\n00:08:23.438 --> 00:08:25.814\nwas also raised in Damascus.\n\n00:08:25.838 --> 00:08:27.374\nHe was a working kind of guy.\n\n00:08:27.398 --> 00:08:30.814\nHe ran a tire repair shop\nand later worked in a printing company.\n\n00:08:30.838 --> 00:08:32.734\nHe lived with his extended family,\n\n00:08:32.758 --> 00:08:35.694\nbut their house got bombed\nearly in the war.\n\n00:08:35.718 --> 00:08:40.638\nSo the family fled to an area\nof Damascus known as Camp Yarmouk.\n\n00:08:42.998 --> 00:08:46.894\nYarmouk is being described\nas the worst place to live\n\n00:08:46.918 --> 00:08:48.117\non planet Earth.\n\n00:08:49.198 --> 00:08:51.973\nThey've been bombed by the military,\nthey've been besieged,\n\n00:08:51.997 --> 00:08:53.379\nthey've been stormed by ISIS\n\n00:08:53.403 --> 00:08:56.254\nand they've been cut off\nfrom supplies for years.\n\n00:08:56.278 --> 00:08:58.421\nThere was a UN official\nwho visited last year,\n\n00:08:58.445 --> 00:09:03.565\nand he said, \"They ate all the grass\nso there was no grass left.\"\n\n00:09:05.398 --> 00:09:07.774\nOut of a population of 150,000,\n\n00:09:07.798 --> 00:09:11.894\nonly 18,000 are believed\nto still be left in Yarmouk.\n\n00:09:11.918 --> 00:09:13.974\nShadi and his sisters got out.\n\n00:09:13.998 --> 00:09:15.998\nThe parents are still stuck inside.\n\n00:09:18.358 --> 00:09:21.894\nSo Shadi and one of his sisters,\nthey fled to Libya.\n\n00:09:21.918 --> 00:09:23.585\nThis was after the fall of Gaddafi,\n\n00:09:23.609 --> 00:09:26.849\nbut before Libya turned\ninto full-blown civil war.\n\n00:09:27.958 --> 00:09:31.414\nAnd in this last remaining\nsort of stability in Libya,\n\n00:09:31.438 --> 00:09:36.558\nShadi took up scuba diving, and he seemed\nto spend most of his time underwater.\n\n00:09:37.758 --> 00:09:39.758\nHe fell completely in love with the ocean,\n\n00:09:40.638 --> 00:09:43.854\nso when he finally decided\nthat he could no longer be in Libya,\n\n00:09:43.878 --> 00:09:46.134\nlate August 2014,\n\n00:09:46.158 --> 00:09:49.038\nhe hoped to find work\nas a diver when he reached Italy.\n\n00:09:50.558 --> 00:09:52.398\nReality was not that easy.\n\n00:09:53.478 --> 00:09:55.294\nWe don't know much about his travels\n\n00:09:55.318 --> 00:09:58.014\nbecause he had a hard time\ncommunicating with his family,\n\n00:09:58.038 --> 00:10:00.054\nbut we do know that he struggled.\n\n00:10:00.078 --> 00:10:01.454\nAnd by the end of September,\n\n00:10:01.478 --> 00:10:03.764\nhe was living on the streets\nsomewhere in France.\n\n00:10:04.798 --> 00:10:07.814\nOn October 7, he calls\nhis cousin in Belgium,\n\n00:10:07.838 --> 00:10:09.814\nand explains his situation.\n\n00:10:09.838 --> 00:10:15.014\nHe said, \"I'm in Calais. I need you\nto come get my backpack and my laptop.\n\n00:10:15.038 --> 00:10:18.974\nI can't afford to pay the people smugglers\nto help me with the crossing to Britain,\n\n00:10:18.998 -->

battery\non the phone went flat,\n\n00:10:27.158 --> 00:10:29.958\nand his phone was never switched on again.\n\n00:10:31.478 --> 00:10:35.534\nWhat was left of Shadi\nwas found nearly three months later,\n\n00:10:35.558 --> 00:10:37.494\n800 kilometers away\n\n00:10:37.518 --> 00:10:39.558\nin a wetsuit on a beach in Norway.\n\n00:10:40.518 --> 00:10:42.654\nHe's still waiting\nfor his funeral in Norway,\n\n00:10:42.678 --> 00:10:45.238\nand none of his family\nwill be able to attend.\n\n00:10:47.038 --> 00:10:49.574\nMany may think that the story\nabout Shadi and Mouaz\n\n00:10:49.598 --> 00:10:51.398\nis a story about death,\n\n00:10:52.758 --> 00:10:53.974\nbut I don't agree.\n\n00:10:53.998 --> 00:10:59.454\nTo me, this is a story about two questions\nthat I think we all share:\n\n00:10:59.478 --> 00:11:01.254\nwhat is a better life,\n\n00:11:01.278 --> 00:11:03.598\nand what am I willing to do to achieve it?\n\n00:11:04.718 --> 00:11:06.494\nAnd to me, and probably a lot of you,\n\n00:11:06.518 --> 00:11:08.094\na better life would mean\n\n00:11:08.118 --> 00:11:11.014\nbeing able to do more\nof what we think of as meaningful,\n\n00:11:11.038 --> 00:11:14.038\nwhether that be spending more time\nwith your family and friends,\n\n00:11:14.062 --> 00:11:15.574\ntravel to an exotic place,\n\n00:11:15.598 --> 00:11:17.934\nor just getting money\nto buy that cool new device\n\n00:11:17.958 --> 00:11:19.654\nor a pair of new sneakers.\n\n00:11:19.678 --> 00:11:22.398\nAnd this is all\nwithin our reach pretty easily.\n\n00:11:23.798 --> 00:11:25.734\nBut if you are fleeing a war zone,\n\n00:11:25.758 --> 00:11:29.734\nthe answers to those two questions\nare dramatically different.\n\n00:11:29.758 --> 00:11:32.014\nA better life is a life in safety.\n\n00:11:32.038 --> 00:11:34.374\nIt's a life in dignity.\n\n00:11:34.398 --> 00:11:37.054\nA better life means\nnot having your house bombed,\n\n00:11:37.078 --> 00:11:38.614\nnot fearing being kidnapped.\n\n00:11:38.638 --> 00:11:41.067\nIt means being able\nto send your children to school,\n\n00:11:41.091 --> 00:11:42.254\ngo to university,\n\n00:11:42.278 --> 00:11:46.694\nor just find work to be able to provide\nfor yourself and the ones you love.\n\n00:11:46.718 --> 00:11:50.334\nA better life would be\na future of some possibilities\n\n00:11:50.358 --> 00:11:52.654\ncompared to nearly none,\n\n00:11:52.678 --> 00:11:54.438\nand that's a strong motivation.\n\n00:11:55.438 --> 00:11:57.534\nAnd I have no trouble imagining\n\n00:11:57.558 --> 00:12:01.054\nthat after spending weeks or even months\n\n00:12:01.078 --> 00:12:02.974\nas a second-grade citizen,\n\n00:12:02.998 --> 00:12:07.134\nliving on the streets\nor in a horrible makeshift camp\n\n00:12:07.158 --> 00:12:10.614\nwith a stupid, racist name\nlike \"The Jungle,\"\n\n00:12:10.638 --> 00:12:14.158\nmost of us would be willing\nto do just about anything.\n\n00:12:15.158 --> 00:12:17.414\nIf I could ask Shadi and Mouaz\n\n00:12:17.438 --> 00:12:21.494\nthe second they stepped into the freezing\nwaters of the English Channel,\n\n00:12:21.518 --> 00:12:24.278\nthey would probably say,\n\"This is worth the risk,\"\n\n00:12:25.118 --> 00:12:28.078\nbecause they could\nno longer see any other option.\n\n00:12:29.358 --> 00:12:30.558\nAnd that's desperation,\n\n00:12:31.638 --> 00:12:36.758\nbut that's the reality of living\nas a refugee in Western Europe in 2015.\n\n00:12:37.718 --> 00:12:38.934\nThank you.\n\n00:12:38.958 -->

time,\nbut they were positive, they had hope.\n\n00:13:13.718 --> 00:13:18.734\nThe last time, the camp has grown,\nmaybe four or five thousand people.\n\n00:13:18.758 --> 00:13:21.334\nIt seemed more

And I could easily tell you that I was shaped by the jazz and hip hop that I grew up with, by the Ethiopian heritage of my ancestors, or by the 1980s pop on my childhood radio stations. But beyond genre, there is another question: how do the sounds we hear every day influence the music that we make? I believe that everyday soundscape can be the most unexpected inspiration for songwriting, and to look at this idea a little bit more closely, I'm going to talk today about three things: nature, language and silence \u2014 or rather, the impossibility of true silence. And through this I hope to give you a sense of a world already alive with musical expression, with each of us serving as active participants, whether we know it or not.I'm going to start today with nature, but before we do that, let's quickly listen to this snippet of an opera singer warming up. Here it is.(Singing)(Singing ends)It's beautiful, isn't it? Gotcha! That is actually not the sound of an opera singer warming up. That is the sound of a bird slowed down to a pace that the human ear mistakenly recognizes as its own. It was released as part of Peter Sz\u00f6ke's 1987 Hungarian recording \"The Unknown Music of Birds,\" where he records many birds and slows down their pitches to reveal what's underneath. Let's listen to the full-speed recording.(Bird singing)Now, let's hear the two of them together so your brain can juxtapose them.(Bird singing at slow then full speed)(Singing ends)It's incredible. Perhaps the techniques of opera singing were inspired by birdsong. As humans, we intuitively understand birds to be our musical teachers.In Ethiopia, birds are considered an integral part of the origin of music itself. The story goes like this: 1,500 years ago, a young man was born in the Empire of Aksum, a major trading center of the ancient world. His name was Yared. When Yared was seven years old his father died, and his mother sent him to go live with an uncle, who was a priest of the Ethiopian Orthodox tradition, one of the oldest churches in the world. Now, this tradition has an enormous amount of scholarship and learning, and Yared had to study and study and study and study, and one day he was studying under a tree, when three birds came to him. One by one, these birds became his teachers. They taught him music \u2014 scales, in fact. And Yared, eventually recognized as Saint Yared, used these scales to compose five volumes of chants and hymns for worship and celebration. And he used these scales to compose and to create an indigenous musical notation system. And these scales evolved into what is known as ki\u00f1it, the unique, pentatonic, five-note, modal system that is very much alive and thriving and still evolving in Ethiopia today.Now, I love this story because it's true at multiple levels. Saint Yared was a real, historical figure, and the natural world can be our musical teacher. And we have so many examples of this: the Pygmies of the Congo tune their instruments to the pitches of the birds in the forest around them. Musician and natural soundscape expert Bernie Krause describes how a healthy environment has animals and insects taking up low, medium and high-frequency bands, in exactly the same way as a symphony does. And countless works of music were inspired by bird and forest song. Yes, the natural world can be our cultural teacher.So let's go now to the uniquely human world of language. Every language communicates with pitch to varying degrees, whether it's Mandarin Chinese, where a shift in melodic inflection gives the same phonetic syllable an entirely different meaning, to a language like English, where a raised pitch at the end of a sentence ... (Going up in pitch) implies a question?(Laughter)As an Ethiopian-American woman, I grew up around the language of Amharic, Amhari\u00f1a. It was my first language, the language of my parents, one of the main languages of Ethiopia. And there are a million reasons to fall in love with this language: its depth of poetics, its double entendres, its wax and gold, its humor, its proverbs that illuminate the wisdom and follies of life. But there's also this melodicism, a musicality built right in. And I find this distilled most clearly in what I like to call emphatic language \u2014 language that's meant to highlight or underline or that springs from surprise. Take, for example, the word: \"indey.\" Now, if there are Ethiopians in the audience, they're probably chuckling to themselves, because the word means something like \"No!\" or \"How could he?\" or \"No, he didn't.\" It kind of depends on the situation. But when I was a kid, this was my very favorite word, and I think it's because it has a pitch. It has a melody. You can almost see the shape as it springs from someone's mouth. \"Indey\" \u2014 it dips, and then raises again. And as a musician and composer, when I hear that word, something like this is floating through my mind.(Music and singing \"Indey\")(Music ends)Or take, for example, the phrase for \"It is right\" or \"It is correct\" \u2014 \"Lickih nehu ... Lickih nehu.\" It's an affirmation, an agreement. \"Lickih nehu.\" When I hear that phrase, something like this starts rolling through my mind.(Music and singing \"Lickih nehu\")(Music ends)And in both of those cases, what I did was I took the melody and the phrasing of those words and phrases and I turned them into musical parts to use in these short compositions. And I like to write bass lines, so they both ended up kind of as bass lines.Now, this is based on the work of Jason Moran and others who work intimately with music and language, but it's also something I've had in my head since I was a kid, how musical my parents sounded when they were speaking to each other and to us. It was from them and from Amhari\u00f1a that I learned that we are awash in musical expression with every word, every sentence that we speak, every word, every sentence that we receive. Perhaps you can hear it in the words I'm speaking even now.Finally, we go to the 1950s United States and the most seminal work of 20th century avant-garde composition: John Cage's \"4:33,\" written for any instrument or combination of instruments. The musician or musicians are invited to walk onto the stage with a stopwatch and open the score, which was actually purchased by the Museum of Modern Art \u2014 the score, that is. And this score has not a single note written and there is not a single note played for four minutes and 33 seconds. And, at once enraging and enrapturing, Cage shows us that even when there are no strings being plucked by fingers or hands hammering piano keys, still there is music, still there is music, still there is music. And what is this music? It was that sneeze in the back.(Laughter)It is the everyday soundscape that arises from the audience themselves: their coughs, their sighs, their rustles, their whispers, their sneezes, the room, the wood of the floors and the walls expanding and contracting, creaking and groaning with the heat and the cold, the pipes clanking and contributing. And controversial though it was, and even controversial though it remains, Cage's point is that there is no such thing as true silence. Even in the most silent environments, we still hear and feel the sound of our own heartbeats. The world is alive with musical expression. We are already immersed.Now, I had my own moment of, let's say, remixing John Cage a couple of months ago when I was standing in front of the stove cooking lentils. And it was late one night and it was time to stir, so I lifted the lid off the cooking pot, and I placed it onto the kitchen counter next to me, and it started to roll back and forth making this sound.(Sound of metal lid clanking against a counter)(Clanking ends)And it stopped me cold. I thought, \"What a weird, cool swing that cooking pan lid has.\" So when the lentils were ready and eaten, I hightailed it to my backyard studio, and I made this.(Music, including the sound of the lid, and singing)(Music ends)Now, John Cage wasn't instructing musicians to mine the soundscape for sonic textures to turn into music. He was saying that on its own, the environment is musically generative, that it is generous, that it is fertile, that we are already immersed.Musician, music researcher, surgeon and human hearing expert Charles Limb is a professor at Johns Hopkins University and he studies music and the brain. And he has a theory that it is possible \u2014 it is possible \u2014 that the human auditory system actually evolved to hear music, because it is so much more complex than it needs to be for language alone. And if that's true, it means that we're hard-wired for music, that we can find it anywhere, that there is no such thing as a musical desert, that we are permanently hanging out at the oasis, and that is marvelous. We can add to the soundtrack, but it's already playing.And it doesn't mean don't study music. Study music, trace your sonic lineages and enjoy that exploration. But there is a kind of sonic lineage to which we all belong. So the next time you are seeking percussion inspiration, look no further than your tires, as they roll over the unusual grooves of the freeway, or the top-right burner of your stove and that strange way that it clicks as it is preparing to light. When seeking melodic inspiration, look no further than dawn and dusk avian orchestras or to the natural lilt of emphatic language. We are the audience and we are the composers and we take from these pieces we are given. We make, we make, we make, we make, knowing that when it comes to nature or language or soundscape, there is no end to the inspiration \u2014 if we are listening.Thank you.(Applause)", "id": 2351,

--> 00:03:17.568\nWhen Yared was seven years old\nhis father died,\n\n00:03:17.592 --> 00:03:21.215\nand his mother sent him to go live\nwith an uncle, who was a priest\n\n00:03:21.239 --> 00:03:23.534\nof the Ethiopian Orthodox tradition,\n\n00:03:23.558 --> 00:03:25.692\none of the oldest churches in the world.\n\n00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:30.311\nNow, this tradition has an enormous amount\nof scholarship and learning,\n\n00:03:30.335 --> 00:03:33.347\nand Yared had to study and study\nand study and study,\n\n00:03:33.371 --> 00:03:35.987\nand one day he was studying under a tree,\n\n00:03:36.011 --> 00:03:38.538\nwhen three birds came to him.\n\n00:03:39.279 --> 00:03:42.347\nOne by one, these birds\nbecame his teachers.\n\n00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:46.162\nThey taught him music -- scales, in fact.\n\n00:03:47.537 --> 00:03:50.040\nAnd Yared, eventually\nrecognized as Saint Yared,\n\n00:03:50.064 --> 00:03:54.502\nused these scales to compose\nfive volumes of chants and hymns\n\n00:03:54.526 --> 00:03:56.698\nfor worship and celebration.\n\n00:03:56.722 --> 00:04:00.111\nAnd he used these scales\nto compose and to create\n\n00:04:00.135 --> 00:04:02.885\nan indigenous musical notation system.\n\n00:04:03.603 --> 00:04:07.226\nAnd these scales evolved\ninto what is known as ki\u00f1it,\n\n00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:13.143\nthe unique, pentatonic, five-note,\nmodal system that is very much alive\n\n00:04:13.167 --> 00:04:17.391\nand thriving and still evolving\nin Ethiopia today.\n\n00:04:18.489 --> 00:04:21.652\nNow, I love this story because\nit's true at multiple levels.\n\n00:04:21.676 --> 00:04:24.699\nSaint Yared was a real, historical figure,\n\n00:04:24.723 --> 00:04:28.672\nand the natural world\ncan be our musical teacher.\n\n00:04:29.015 --> 00:04:31.169\nAnd we have so many examples of this:\n\n00:04:31.193 --> 00:04:33.416\nthe Pygmies of the Congo\ntune their instruments\n\n00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:36.040\nto the pitches of the birds\nin the forest around them.\n\n00:04:36.354 --> 00:04:39.532\nMusician and natural soundscape\nexpert Bernie Krause describes\n\n00:04:39.556 --> 00:04:42.930\nhow a healthy environment\nhas animals and insects\n\n00:04:42.954 --> 00:04:46.382\ntaking up low, medium\nand high-frequency bands,\n\n00:04:46.406 --> 00:04:49.600\nin exactly the same way\nas a symphony does.\n\n00:04:50.024 --> 00:04:54.387\nAnd countless works of music\nwere inspired by bird and forest song.\n\n00:04:54.930 --> 00:04:59.803\nYes, the natural world\ncan be our cultural teacher.\n\n00:05:00.709 --> 00:05:04.082\nSo let's go now to the uniquely\nhuman world of language.\n\n00:05:05.041 --> 00:05:08.285\nEvery language communicates\nwith pitch to varying degrees,\n\n00:05:08.309 --> 00:05:09.747\nwhether it's Mandarin Chinese,\n\n00:05:09.771 --> 00:05:13.763\nwhere a shift in melodic inflection\ngives the same phonetic syllable\n\n00:05:13.787 --> 00:05:15.544\nan entirely different meaning,\n\n00:05:15.568 --> 00:05:16.910\nto a language like English,\n\n00:05:16.934 --> 00:05:19.304\nwhere a raised pitch\nat the end of a sentence ...\n\n00:05:19.328 --> 00:05:21.346\n(Going up in pitch) implies a question?\n\n00:05:21.370 --> 00:05:22.979\n(Laughter)\n\n00:05:23.003 --> 00:05:24.662\nAs an Ethiopian-American woman,\n\n00:05:24.686 --> 00:05:27.094\nI grew up around the language\nof Amharic, Amhari\u00f1a.\n\n00:05:27.118 --> 00:05:29.597\nIt was my first language,\nthe language of my parents,\n\n00:05:29.621 --> 00:05:32.178\none of the main languages of Ethiopia.\n\n00:05:32.674 --> 00:05:35.868\nAnd there are a million reasons\nto fall in love with this language:\n\n00:05:35.892 --> 00:05:38.733\nits depth of poetics,\nits double entendres,\n\n00:05:38.757 --> 00:05:41.374\nits wax and gold, its humor,\n\n00:05:41.398 --> 00:05:45.288\nits proverbs that illuminate\nthe wisdom and follies of life.\n\n00:05:45.996 --> 00:05:50.075\nBut there's also this melodicism,\na musicality built right in.\n\n00:05:50.692 --> 00:05:52.567\nAnd I find this distilled most clearly\n\n00:05:52.591 --> 00:05:55.064\nin what I like to call\nemphatic language --\n\n00:05:55.088 --> 00:05:57.324\nlanguage that's meant\nto highlight or underline\n\n00:05:57.348 --> 00:05:59.403\nor that springs from surprise.\n\n00:05:59.994 --> 00:06:02.401\nTake, for example, the word: \"indey.\"\n\n00:06:03.162 --> 00:06:05.264\nNow, if there are Ethiopians\nin the audience,\n\n00:06:05.288 --> 00:06:07.295\nthey're probably chuckling to themselves,\n\n00:06:07.319 --> 00:06:09.403\nbecause the word means\nsomething like \"No!\"\n\n00:06:09.427 --> 00:06:11.238\nor \"How could he?\" or \"No, he didn't.\"\n\n00:06:11.262 --> 00:06:13.363\nIt kind of depends on the situation.\n\n00:06:13.387 --> 00:06:17.238\nBut when I was a kid,\nthis was my very favorite word,\n\n00:06:17.262 --> 00:06:20.362\nand I think it's because it has a pitch.\n\n00:06:20.679 --> 00:06:21.890\nIt has a melody.\n\n00:06:21.914 --> 00:06:24.915\nYou can almost see the shape\nas it springs from someone's mouth.\n\n00:06:24.939 --> 00:06:27.668\n\"Indey\" -- it dips, and then raises again.\n\n00:06:28.349 --> 00:06:31.438\nAnd as a musician and composer,\nwhen I hear that word,\n\n00:06:31.462 --> 00:06:34.531\nsomething like this\nis floating through my mind.\n\n00:06:35.940 --> 00:06:40.940\n(Music and singing \"Indey\")\n\n00:06:45.790 --> 00:06:47.790\n(Music ends)\n\n00:06:48.669 --> 00:06:52.660\nOr take, for example, the phrase\nfor \"It is right\" or \"It is correct\" --\n\n00:06:52.684 --> 00:06:54.256\n\"Lickih nehu ... Lickih nehu.\"\n\n00:06:54.280 --> 00:06:56.913\nIt's an affirmation, an agreement.\n\n00:06:56.937 --> 00:06:58.095\n\"Lickih nehu.\"\n\n00:06:58.119 --> 00:06:59.271\nWhen I hear that phrase,\n\n00:06:59.295 --> 00:07:02.792\nsomething like this starts rolling\nthrough my mind.\n\n00:07:03.989 --> 00:07:08.989\n(Music and singing \"Lickih nehu\")\n\n00:07:11.530 --> 00:07:13.530\n(Music ends)\n\n00:07:14.157 --> 00:07:16.974\nAnd in both of those cases,\nwhat I did was I took the melody\n\n00:07:16.998 --> 00:07:19.457\nand the phrasing\nof those words and phrases\n\n00:07:19.481 --> 00:07:24.047\nand I turned them into musical parts\nto use in these short compositions.\n\n00:07:24.497 --> 00:07:25.978\nAnd I like to write bass lines,\n\n00:07:26.002 --> 00:07:28.053\nso they both ended up\nkind of as bass lines.\n\n00:07:29.345 --> 00:07:31.971\nNow, this is based on the work\nof Jason Moran and others\n\n00:07:31.995 --> 00:07:35.033\nwho work intimately\nwith music and language,\n\n00:07:35.057 --> 00:07:38.001\nbut it's also something I've had\nin my head since I was a kid,\n\n00:07:38.025 --> 00:07:40.056\nhow musical my parents sounded\n\n00:07:40.080 --> 00:07:43.232\nwhen they were speaking\nto each other and to us.\n\n00:07:44.028 --> 00:07:46.402\nIt was from them\nand from Amhari\u00f1a that I learned\n\n00:07:46.426 --> 00:07:49.306\nthat we are awash in musical expression\n\n00:07:49.330 --> 00:07:51.945\nwith every word,\nevery sentence that we speak,\n\n00:07:51.969 --> 00:07:54.721\nevery word, every sentence\nthat we receive.\n\n00:07:54.745 --> 00:07:59.004\nPerhaps you can hear it\nin the words I'm speaking even now.\n\n00:08:00.195 --> 00:08:02.610\nFinally, we go to the 1950s United States\n\n00:08:02.634 --> 00:08:06.545\nand the most seminal work\nof 20th century avant-garde composition:\n\n00:08:06.569 --> 00:08:08.693\nJohn Cage's \"4:33,\"\n\n00:08:08.717 --> 00:08:11.951\nwritten for any instrument\nor combination of instruments.\n\n00:08:12.870 --> 00:08:16.429\nThe musician or musicians are invited\nto walk onto the stage\n\n00:08:16.453 --> 00:08:19.643\nwith a stopwatch and open the score,\n\n00:08:19.667 --> 00:08:22.598\nwhich was actually purchased\nby the Museum of Modern Art --\n\n00:08:22.622 --> 00:08:24.004\nthe score, that is.\n\n00:08:24.599 --> 00:08:28.107\nAnd this score has not\na single note written\n\n00:08:28.131 --> 00:08:30.605\nand there is not a single note played\n\n00:08:30.629 --> 00:08:33.361\nfor four minutes and 33 seconds.\n\n00:08:34.498 --> 00:08:39.188\nAnd, at once enraging and enrapturing,\n\n00:08:39.212 --> 00:08:42.100\nCage shows us that even\nwhen there are no strings\n\n00:08:42.124 --> 00:08:47.172\nbeing plucked by fingers\nor hands hammering piano keys,\n\n00:08:47.196 --> 00:08:49.673\nstill there is music,\nstill there is music,\n\n00:08:49.697 --> 00:08:51.759\nstill there is music.\n\n00:08:51.783 --> 00:08:53.911\nAnd what is this music?\n\n00:08:54.861 --> 00:08:57.066\nIt was that sneeze in the back.\n\n00:08:57.090 --> 00:08:58.636\n(Laughter)\n\n00:08:58.660 --> 00:09:03.720\nIt is the everyday soundscape\nthat arises from the audience themselves:\n\n00:09:03.745 --> 00:09:08.014\ntheir coughs, their sighs, their rustles,\ntheir whispers, their sneezes,\n\n00:09:08.038 --> 00:09:10.579\nthe room, the wood\nof the floors and the walls\n\n00:09:10.603 --> 00:09:13.061\nexpanding and contracting,\ncreaking and groaning\n\n00:09:13.085 --> 00:09:14.489\nwith the heat and the cold,\n\n00:09:14.513 --> 00:09:17.604\nthe pipes clanking and contributing.\n\n00:09:19.264 --> 00:09:22.904\nAnd controversial though it was,\nand even controversial though it remains,\n\n00:09:22.928 --> 00:09:27.172\nCage's point is that there is no\nsuch thing as true silence.\n\n00:09:28.065 --> 00:09:32.570\nEven in the most silent environments,\nwe still hear and feel the sound\n\n00:09:32.594 --> 00:09:34.121\nof our own heartbeats.\n\n00:09:34.604 --> 00:09:37.772\nThe world is alive\nwith musical expression.\n\n00:09:38.341 --> 00:09:40.548\nWe are already immersed.\n\n00:09:42.288 --> 00:09:45.981\nNow, I had my own moment of,\nlet's say, remixing John Cage\n\n00:09:46.005 --> 00:09:47.672\na couple of months ago\n\n00:09:47.696 --> 00:09:50.699\nwhen I was standing\nin front of the stove cooking lentils.\n\n00:09:50.723 --> 00:09:53.865\nAnd it was late one night\nand it was time to stir,\n\n00:09:53.889 --> 00:09:55.861\nso I lifted the lid off the cooking pot,\n\n00:09:55.885 --> 00:09:58.318\nand I placed it onto\nthe kitchen counter next to me,\n\n00:09:58.342 --> 00:10:00.605\nand it started to roll back and forth\n\n00:10:00.629 --> 00:10:03.390\nmaking this sound.\n\n00:10:04.723 --> 00:10:09.723\n(Sound of metal lid\nclanking against a counter)\n\n00:10:10.887 --> 00:10:12.037\n(Clanking ends)\n\n00:10:13.483 --> 00:10:15.017\nAnd it stopped me cold.\n\n00:10:15.685 --> 00:10:20.908\nI thought, \"What a weird, cool swing\nthat cooking pan lid has.\"\n\n00:10:22.158 --> 00:10:26.742\nSo when the lentils were ready and eaten,\n\n00:10:26.766 --> 00:10:30.260\nI hightailed it to my backyard studio,\n\n00:10:30.284 --> 00:10:32.127\nand I made this.\n\n00:10:33.145 --> 00:10:38.145\n(Music, including the sound\nof the lid, and singing)\n\n00:10:50.229 --> 00:10:51.379\n(Music ends)\n\n00:10:52.437 --> 00:10:54.849\nNow, John Cage\nwasn't instructing musicians\n\n00:10:54.873 --> 00:10:58.568\nto mine the soundscape\nfor sonic textures to turn into music.\n\n00:10:59.018 --> 00:11:01.871\nHe was saying that on its own,\n\n00:11:01.895 --> 00:11:05.356\nthe environment is musically generative,\n\n00:11:05.380 --> 00:11:09.621\nthat it is generous, that it is fertile,\n\n00:11:09.645 --> 00:11:11.808\nthat we are already immersed.\n\n00:11:12.723 --> 00:11:18.736\nMusician, music researcher, surgeon\nand human hearing expert Charles Limb\n\n00:11:18.760 --> 00:11:20.815\nis a professor at Johns Hopkins University\n\n00:11:20.839 --> 00:11:23.108\nand he studies music and the brain.\n\n00:11:24.697 --> 00:11:26.463\nAnd he has a theory\n\n00:11:27.693 --> 00:11:30.789\nthat it is possible -- it is possible --\n\n00:11:30.813 --> 00:11:35.961\nthat the human auditory system\nactually evolved to hear music,\n\n00:11:35.985 --> 00:11:41.056\nbecause it is so much more complex\nthan it needs to be for language alone.\n\n00:11:41.691 --> 00:11:43.466\nAnd if that's true,\n\n00:11:43.490 --> 00:11:46.435\nit means that we're hard-wired for music,\n\n00:11:46.459 --> 00:11:48.572\nthat we can find it anywhere,\n\n00:11:48.596 --> 00:11:51.674\nthat there is no such thing\nas a musical desert,\n\n00:11:51.698 --> 00:11:55.397\nthat we are permanently\nhanging out at the oasis,\n\n00:11:55.421 --> 00:11:57.478\nand that is marvelous.\n\n00:11:58.093 --> 00:12:01.286\nWe can add to the soundtrack,\nbut it's already playing.\n\n00:12:02.218 --> 00:12:04.072\nAnd it doesn't mean don't study music.\n\n00:12:04.096 --> 00:12:08.592\nStudy music, trace your sonic lineages\nand enjoy that exploration.\n\n00:12:09.313 --> 00:12:13.048\nBut there is a kind of sonic lineage\nto which we all belong.\n\n00:12:14.225 --> 00:12:16.848\nSo the next time you are seeking\npercussion inspiration,\n\n00:12:16.872 --> 00:12:20.221\nlook no further than your tires,\nas they roll over the unusual grooves\n\n00:12:20.245 --> 00:12:21.969\nof the freeway,\n\n00:12:21.993 --> 00:12:24.171\nor the top-right burner of your stove\n\n00:12:24.195 --> 00:12:25.904\nand that strange way that it clicks\n\n00:12:25.928 --> 00:12:27.990\nas it is preparing to light.\n\n00:12:28.691 --> 00:12:30.303\nWhen seeking melodic inspiration,\n\n00:12:30.327 --> 00:12:33.819\nlook no further than dawn\nand dusk avian orchestras\n\n00:12:33.843 --> 00:12:37.071\nor to the natural lilt\nof emphatic language.\n\n00:12:37.095 --> 00:12:40.094\nWe are the audience\nand we are the composers\n\n00:12:40.118 --> 00:12:41.913\nand we take from these pieces\n\n00:12:41.937 --> 00:12:43.088\nwe are given.\n\n00:12:43.112 --> 00:12:44.980\nWe make, we make, we make, we make,\n\n00:12:45.004 --> 00:12:49.424\nknowing that when it comes to nature\nor language or soundscape,\n\n00:12:49.448 --> 00:12:52.445\nthere is no end to the inspiration --\n\n00:12:52.469 --> 00:12:54.903\nif we are listening.\n\n00:12:55.379 --> 00:12:56.531\nThank you.\n\n00:12:56.555 --> 00:13:02.329\n(Applause)"}, {"title": "The secret US prisons you've never heard of before", "duration": "895", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/will_potter_the_secret_us_prisons_you_ve_never_heard_of_before", "transcript": "Father Daniel Berrigan once said that \"writing about prisoners is a little like writing about the dead.\" I think what he meant is that we treat prisoners as ghosts. They're unseen and unheard. It's easy to simply ignore them and it's even easier when the government goes to great lengths to keep them hidden.As a journalist, I think these stories of what people in power do when no one is watching, are precisely the stories that we need to tell. That's why I began investigating the most secretive and experimental prison units in the United States, for so-called \"second-tier\" terrorists. The government calls these units Communications Management Units or CMUs. Prisoners and guards call them \"Little Guantanamo.\" They are islands unto themselves. But unlike Gitmo they exist right here, at home, floating within larger federal prisons.There are 2 CMUs. One was opened inside the prison in Terre Haute, Indiana, and the other is inside this prison, in Marion, Illinois. Neither of them underwent the formal review process that is required by law when they were opened. CMU prisoners have all been convicted of crimes. Some of their cases are questionable and some involve threats and violence. I'm not here to argue the guilt or innocence of any prisoner. I'm here because as Supreme Court Justice Thurgood Marshall said, \"When the prisons and gates slam shut, prisoners do not lose their human quality.\"Every prisoner I've interviewed has said there are three flecks of light in the darkness of prison: phone calls, letters and visits from family. CMUs aren't solitary confinement, but they radically restrict all of these to levels that meet or exceed the most extreme prisons in the United States. Their phone calls can be limited to 45 minutes a month, compared to the 300 minutes other prisoners receive. Their letters can be limited to six pieces of paper. Their visits can be limited to four hours per month, compared to the 35 hours that people like Olympic Park bomber Eric Rudolph receive in the supermax. On top of that, CMU visits are non-contact which means prisoners are not allowed to even hug their family. As one CMU prisoner said, \"We're not being tortured here, except psychologically.\"The government won't say who is imprisoned here. But through court documents, open records requests and interviews with current and former prisoners, some small windows into the CMUs have opened.There's an estimated 60 to 70 prisoners here, and they're overwhelmingly Muslim. They include people like Dr. Rafil Dhafir, who violated the economic sanctions on Iraq by sending medical supplies for the children there. They've included people like Yassin Aref. Aref and his family fled to New York from Saddam Hussein's Iraq as refugees. He was arrested in 2004 as part of an FBI sting. Aref is an imam and he was asked to bear witness to a loan, which is a tradition in Islamic culture. It turned out that one of the people involved in the loan was trying to enlist someone else in a fake attack. Aref didn't know. For that, he was convicted of conspiracy to provide material support to a terrorist group.The CMUs also include some non-Muslim prisoners. The guards call them \"balancers,\" meaning they help balance out the racial numbers, in hopes of deflecting law suits. These balancers include animal rights and environmental activists like Daniel McGowan.McGowan was convicted of participating in two arsons in the name of defending the environment as part of the Earth Liberation Front. During his sentencing, he was afraid that he would be sent to a rumored secret prison for terrorists. The judge dismissed all those fears, saying that they weren't supported by any facts. But that might be because the government hasn't fully explained why some prisoners end up in a CMU, and who is responsible for these decisions. When McGowan was transferred, he was told it's because he is a \"domestic terrorist,\" a term the FBI uses repeatedly when talking about environmental activists. Now, keep in mind there are about 400 prisoners in US prisons who are classified as terrorists, and only a handful of them are in the CMUs. In McGowan's case, he was previously at a low-security prison and he had no communications violations.So, why was he moved? Like other CMU prisoners, McGowan repeatedly asked for an answer, a hearing, or some opportunity for an appeal. This example from another prisoner shows how those requests are viewed. \"Wants a transfer.\" \"Told him no.\" At one point, the prison warden himself recommended McGowan's transfer out of the CMU citing his good behavior, but the warden was overruled by the Bureau of Prison's Counterterrorism Unit, working with the Joint Terrorism Task Force of the FBI.Later I found out that McGowan was really sent to a CMU not because of what he did, but what he has said. A memo from the Counterterrorism Unit cited McGowan's \"anti-government beliefs.\" While imprisoned, he continued writing about environmental issues, saying that activists must reflect on their mistakes and listen to each other. Now, in fairness, if you've spent any time at all in Washington, DC, you know this is really a radical concept for the government.(Laughter)I actually asked to visit McGowan in the CMU. And I was approved. That came as quite a shock. First, because as I've discussed on this stage before, I learned that the FBI has been monitoring my work. Second, because it would make me the first and only journalist to visit a CMU. I had even learned through the Bureau of Prisons Counterterrorism Unit, that they had been monitoring my speeches about CMUs, like this one. So how could I possibly be approved to visit? A few days before I went out to the prison, I got an answer.I was allowed to visit McGowan as a friend, not a journalist. Journalists are not allowed here. McGowan was told by CMU officials that if I asked any questions or published any story, that he would be punished for my reporting. When I arrived for our visit, the guards reminded me that they knew who I was and knew about my work. And they said that if I attempted to interview McGowan, the visit would be terminated. The Bureau of Prisons describes CMUs as \"self-contained housing units.\" But I think that's an Orwellian way of describing black holes. When you visit a CMU, you go through all the security checkpoints that you would expect. But then the walk to the visitation room is silent. When a CMU prisoner has a visit, the rest of the prison is on lockdown. I was ushered into a small room, so small my outstretched arms could touch each wall. There was a grapefruit-sized orb in the ceiling for the visit to be live-monitored by the Counterterrorism Unit in West Virginia. The unit insists that all the visits have to be in English for CMU prisoners, which is an additional hardship for many of the Muslim families. There is a thick sheet of foggy, bulletproof glass and on the other side was Daniel McGowan. We spoke through these handsets attached to the wall and talked about books and movies. We did our best to find reasons to laugh. To fight boredom and amuse himself while in the CMU, McGowan had been spreading a rumor that I was secretly the president of a Twilight fan club in Washington, DC(Laughter)For the record, I'm not.(Laughter) But I kind of the hope the FBI now thinks that Bella and Edward are terrorist code names.(Laughter)During our visit, McGowan spoke most and at length about his niece Lily, his wife Jenny and how torturous it feels to never be able to hug them, to never be able to hold their hands. Three months after our visit, McGowan was transferred out of the CMU and then, without warning, he was sent back again. I had published leaked CMU documents on my website and the Counterterrorism Unit said that McGowan had called his wife and asked her to mail them. He wanted to see what the government was saying about him, and for that he was sent back to the CMU. When he was finally released at the end of his sentence, his story got even more Kafkaesque. He wrote an article for the Huffington Post headlined, \"Court Documents Prove I was Sent to a CMU for my Political Speech.\"The next day he was thrown back in jail for his political speech. His attorneys quickly secured his release, but the message was very clear: Don't talk about this place.Today, nine years after they were opened by the Bush administration, the government is codifying how and why CMUs were created. According to the Bureau of Prisons, they are for prisoners with \"inspirational significance.\" I think that is very nice way of saying these are political prisons for political prisoners.Prisoners are sent to a CMU because of their race, their religion or their political beliefs.Now, if you think that characterization is too strong, just look at some of the government's own documents. When some of McGowan's mail was rejected by the CMU, the sender was told it's because the letters were intended \"for political prisoners.\" When another prisoner, animal rights activist Andy Stepanian, was sent to a CMU, it was because of his anti-government and anti-corporate views.Now, I know all of this may be hard to believe, that it's happening right now, and in the United States. But the unknown reality is that the US has a dark history of disproportionately punishing people because of their political beliefs. In the 1960s, before Marion was home to the CMU, it was home to the notorious Control Unit. Prisoners were locked down in solitary for 22 hours a day. The warden said the unit was to \"control revolutionary attitudes.\" In the 1980s, another experiment called the Lexington High Security Unit held women connected to the Weather Underground, Black Liberation and Puerto Rican independent struggles. The prison radically restricted communication and used sleep deprivation, and constant light for so-called \"ideological conversion.\" Those prisons were eventually shut down, but only through the campaigning of religious groups and human rights advocates, like Amnesty International.Today, civil rights lawyers with the Center for Constitutional Rights are challenging CMUs in court for depriving prisoners of their due process rights and for retaliating against them for their protected political and religious speech. Many of these documents would have never come to light without this lawsuit.The message of these groups and my message for you today is that we must bear witness to what is being done to these prisoners. Their treatment is a reflection of the values held beyond prison walls. This story is not just about prisoners. It is about us. It is about our own commitment to human rights. It is about whether we will choose to stop repeating the mistakes of our past. If we don't listen to what Father Berrigan described as the stories of the dead, they will soon become the stories of ourselves.Thank you.(Applause)(Applause ends)Tom Rielly: I have a couple questions. When I was in high school, I learned about the Bill of Rights, the Constitution, freedom of speech, due process and  about 25 other laws and rights that seem to be violated by this. How could this possibly be happening?Will Potter: I think that's the number one question I get throughout all of my work, and the short answer is that people don't know. I think the solution to any of these types of situations, any rights abuses, are really dependent on two things. They're dependent on knowledge that it's actually happening and then a means and efficacy to actually make a change. And unfortunately with these prisoners, one, people don't know what's happening at all and then they're already disenfranchised populations who don't have access to attorneys, not native English speakers. In some of these cases, they have great representation that I mentioned, but there's just not a public awareness of what's happening.TR: Isn't it guaranteed in prison that you have right to council or access to council?WP: There's a tendency in our culture to see when people have been convicted of a crime, no matter if that charge was bogus or legitimate, that whatever happens to them after that is warranted. And I think that's a really damaging and dangerous narrative that we have, that allows these types of things to happen, as the general public just kind of turns a blind eye to it.TR: All those documents on screen were all real documents, word for word, unchanged at all, right?WP: Absolutely. I've actually uploaded all of them to my website. It's willpotter.com/CMU and it's a footnoted version of the talk, so you can see the documents for yourself without the little snippets. You can see the full version. I relied overwhelmingly on primary source documents or on primary interviews with former and current prisoners, with people that are dealing with this situation every day. And like I said, I've been there myself, as well.TR: You're doing courageous work.WP: Thank you very much. Thank you all.(Applause)", "id": 2352, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:13.691 --> 00:00:16.855\nFather Daniel Berrigan once said\nthat \"writing about

--> 00:07:06.730\nWhen I arrived for our visit,\nthe guards reminded me\n\n00:07:06.754 --> 00:07:09.028\nthat they knew who I was\nand knew about my work.\n\n00:07:09.052 --> 00:07:11.632\nAnd they said that if I attempted\nto interview McGowan,\n\n00:07:11.656 --> 00:07:13.333\nthe visit would be terminated.\n\n00:07:14.629 --> 00:07:20.126\nThe Bureau of Prisons describes CMUs\nas \"self-contained housing units.\"\n\n00:07:20.473 --> 00:07:24.234\nBut I think that's an Orwellian way\nof describing black holes.\n\n00:07:24.763 --> 00:07:25.915\nWhen you visit a CMU,\n\n00:07:25.939 --> 00:07:29.065\nyou go through all the security\ncheckpoints that you would expect.\n\n00:07:29.089 --> 00:07:32.204\nBut then the walk\nto the visitation room is silent.\n\n00:07:33.714 --> 00:07:38.185\nWhen a CMU prisoner has a visit,\nthe rest of the prison is on lockdown.\n\n00:07:39.070 --> 00:07:40.896\nI was ushered into a small room,\n\n00:07:40.920 --> 00:07:44.408\nso small my outstretched arms\ncould touch each wall.\n\n00:07:44.719 --> 00:07:47.514\nThere was a grapefruit-sized\norb in the ceiling\n\n00:07:47.538 --> 00:07:50.713\nfor the visit to be live-monitored\nby the Counterterrorism Unit\n\n00:07:50.737 --> 00:07:52.186\nin West Virginia.\n\n00:07:52.598 --> 00:07:56.957\nThe unit insists that all the visits\nhave to be in English for CMU prisoners,\n\n00:07:56.981 --> 00:08:00.179\nwhich is an additional hardship\nfor many of the Muslim families.\n\n00:08:00.592 --> 00:08:03.974\nThere is a thick sheet of foggy,\nbulletproof glass\n\n00:08:03.998 --> 00:08:07.256\nand on the other side was Daniel McGowan.\n\n00:08:08.062 --> 00:08:10.920\nWe spoke through these handsets\nattached to the wall\n\n00:08:10.944 --> 00:08:13.268\nand talked about books and movies.\n\n00:08:13.292 --> 00:08:15.916\nWe did our best to find reasons to laugh.\n\n00:08:16.512 --> 00:08:19.679\nTo fight boredom and amuse himself\nwhile in the CMU,\n\n00:08:19.703 --> 00:08:23.783\nMcGowan had been spreading a rumor\nthat I was secretly the president\n\n00:08:23.807 --> 00:08:27.778\nof a Twilight fan club in Washington, DC\n\n00:08:27.802 --> 00:08:29.357\n(Laughter)\n\n00:08:29.794 --> 00:08:32.143\nFor the record, I'm not.\n\n00:08:32.167 --> 00:08:33.407\n(Laughter)\n\n00:08:33.712 --> 00:08:37.310\nBut I kind of the hope the FBI\nnow thinks that Bella and Edward\n\n00:08:37.334 --> 00:08:39.480\nare terrorist code names.\n\n00:08:39.504 --> 00:08:41.014\n(Laughter)\n\n00:08:42.031 --> 00:08:48.473\nDuring our visit, McGowan spoke most\nand at length about his niece Lily,\n\n00:08:48.497 --> 00:08:54.621\nhis wife Jenny and how torturous\nit feels to never be able to hug them,\n\n00:08:54.645 --> 00:08:56.875\nto never be able to hold their hands.\n\n00:08:58.185 --> 00:09:01.708\nThree months after our visit, McGowan\nwas transferred out of the CMU\n\n00:09:01.732 --> 00:09:04.748\nand then, without warning,\nhe was sent back again.\n\n00:09:05.914 --> 00:09:10.154\nI had published leaked\nCMU documents on my website\n\n00:09:10.178 --> 00:09:13.399\nand the Counterterrorism Unit said\nthat McGowan had called his wife\n\n00:09:13.423 --> 00:09:15.709\nand asked her to mail them.\n\n00:09:16.265 --> 00:09:18.998\nHe wanted to see what the government\nwas saying about him,\n\n00:09:19.022 --> 00:09:21.630\nand for that he was sent back to the CMU.\n\n00:09:21.940 --> 00:09:24.590\nWhen he was finally released\nat the end of his sentence,\n\n00:09:24.614 --> 00:09:26.696\nhis story got even more Kafkaesque.\n\n00:09:27.392 --> 00:09:29.932\nHe wrote an article\nfor the Huffington Post headlined,\n\n00:09:29.956 --> 00:09:33.657\n\"Court Documents Prove I was Sent to\na CMU for my Political Speech.\"\n\n00:09:34.080 --> 00:09:39.995\nThe next day he was thrown\nback in jail for his political speech.\n\n00:09:40.881 --> 00:09:42.914\nHis attorneys quickly secured his release,\n\n00:09:42.938 --> 00:09:45.536\nbut the message was very clear:\n\n00:09:45.560 --> 00:09:47.259\nDon't talk about this place.\n\n00:09:48.430 --> 00:09:53.023\nToday, nine years after they were opened\nby the Bush administration,\n\n00:09:53.047 --> 00:09:57.640\nthe government is codifying\nhow and why CMUs were created.\n\n00:09:57.664 --> 00:09:59.336\nAccording to the Bureau of Prisons,\n\n00:09:59.360 --> 00:10:03.334\nthey are for prisoners\nwith \"inspirational significance.\"\n\n00:10:04.283 --> 00:10:08.487\nI think that is very nice way of saying\nthese are political prisons\n\n00:10:08.511 --> 00:10:10.095\nfor political prisoners.\n\n00:10:10.722 --> 00:10:13.478\nPrisoners are sent to a CMU\nbecause of their race,\n\n00:10:13.502 --> 00:10:16.149\ntheir religion or their\npolitical beliefs.\n\n00:10:16.728 --> 00:10:19.549\nNow, if you think that\ncharacterization is too strong,\n\n00:10:19.573 --> 00:10:22.390\njust look at some\nof the government's own documents.\n\n00:10:22.414 --> 00:10:26.930\nWhen some of McGowan's mail was rejected\nby the CMU, the sender was told\n\n00:10:26.954 --> 00:10:30.568\nit's because the letters were intended\n\"for political prisoners.\"\n\n00:10:31.368 --> 00:10:35.186\nWhen another prisoner, animal rights\nactivist Andy Stepanian,\n\n00:10:35.210 --> 00:10:40.599\nwas sent to a CMU, it was because of his\nanti-government and anti-corporate views.\n\n00:10:41.680 --> 00:10:44.650\nNow, I know all of this\nmay be hard to believe,\n\n00:10:44.674 --> 00:10:48.632\nthat it's happening right now,\nand in the United States.\n\n00:10:49.117 --> 00:10:52.753\nBut the unknown reality\nis that the US has a dark history\n\n00:10:52.777 --> 00:10:57.168\nof disproportionately punishing people\nbecause of their political beliefs.\n\n00:10:57.628 --> 00:11:02.074\nIn the 1960s, before Marion\nwas home to the CMU,\n\n00:11:02.098 --> 00:11:04.979\nit was home to the notorious Control Unit.\n\n00:11:05.532 --> 00:11:09.481\nPrisoners were locked down\nin solitary for 22 hours a day.\n\n00:11:10.198 --> 00:11:15.904\nThe warden said the unit\nwas to \"control revolutionary attitudes.\"\n\n00:11:16.804 --> 00:11:21.751\nIn the 1980s, another experiment called\nthe Lexington High Security Unit\n\n00:11:21.775 --> 00:11:24.203\nheld women connected\nto the Weather Underground,\n\n00:11:24.227 --> 00:11:27.493\nBlack Liberation and Puerto Rican\nindependent struggles.\n\n00:11:27.945 --> 00:11:32.191\nThe prison radically restricted\ncommunication and used sleep deprivation,\n\n00:11:32.215 --> 00:11:36.812\nand constant light for so-called\n\"ideological conversion.\"\n\n00:11:37.934 --> 00:11:43.026\nThose prisons were eventually shut down,\nbut only through the campaigning\n\n00:11:43.050 --> 00:11:47.451\nof religious groups and human rights\nadvocates, like Amnesty International.\n\n00:11:48.356 --> 00:11:52.282\nToday, civil rights lawyers\nwith the Center for Constitutional Rights\n\n00:11:52.306 --> 00:11:54.685\nare challenging CMUs in court\n\n00:11:54.709 --> 00:11:57.264\nfor depriving prisoners\nof their due process rights\n\n00:11:57.288 --> 00:11:59.368\nand for retaliating against them\n\n00:11:59.392 --> 00:12:02.702\nfor their protected political\nand religious speech.\n\n00:12:03.254 --> 00:12:06.922\nMany of these documents would have\nnever come to light without this lawsuit.\n\n00:12:08.356 --> 00:12:12.987\nThe message of these groups\nand my message for you today\n\n00:12:13.011 --> 00:12:16.767\nis that we must bear witness\nto what is being done to these prisoners.\n\n00:12:16.791 --> 00:12:21.834\nTheir treatment is a reflection\nof the values held beyond prison walls.\n\n00:12:22.297 --> 00:12:24.913\nThis story is not just about prisoners.\n\n00:12:24.937 --> 00:12:26.961\nIt is about us.\n\n00:12:26.985 --> 00:12:29.732\nIt is about our own commitment\nto human rights.\n\n00:12:29.756 --> 00:12:34.481\nIt is about whether we will choose to stop\nrepeating the mistakes of our past.\n\n00:12:35.035 --> 00:12:40.067\nIf we don't listen to what Father Berrigan\ndescribed as the stories of the dead,\n\n00:12:40.091 --> 00:12:42.554\nthey will soon become\nthe stories of ourselves.\n\n00:12:42.858 -->

00:13:20.252\nand the short answer is\nthat people don't know.\n\n00:13:20.767 --> 00:13:24.658\nI think the solution to any of these types\nof situations, any rights abuses,\n\n00:13:24.682 --> 00:13:26.375\nare really dependent on two things.\n\n00:13:26.399 --> 00:13:29.195\nThey're dependent on knowledge\nthat it's actually happening\n\n00:13:29.219 --> 00:13:33.501\nand then a means and efficacy\nto actually make a change.\n\n00:13:33.525 --> 00:13:35.922\nAnd unfortunately with these prisoners,\n\n00:13:35.946 --> 00:13:38.521\none, people don't know\nwhat's happening at all\n\n00:13:38.545 --> 00:13:41.133\nand then they're already\ndisenfranchised populations\n\n00:13:41.157 --> 00:13:45.189\nwho don't have access to attorneys,\nnot native English

It's called CRISPR-Cas9. The CRISPR technology allows scientists to make changes to the DNA in cells that could allow us to cure genetic disease.You might be interested to know that the CRISPR technology came about through a basic research project that was aimed at discovering how bacteria fight viral infections. Bacteria have to deal with viruses in their environment, and we can think about a viral infection like a ticking time bomb \u2014 a bacterium has only a few minutes to defuse the bomb before it gets destroyed. So, many bacteria have in their cells an adaptive immune system called CRISPR, that allows them to detect viral DNA and destroy it.Part of the CRISPR system is a protein called Cas9, that's able to seek out, cut and eventually degrade viral DNA in a specific way. And it was through our research to understand the activity of this protein, Cas9, that we realized that we could harness its function as a genetic engineering technology \u2014 a way for scientists to delete or insert specific bits of DNA into cells with incredible precision \u2014 that would offer opportunities to do things that really haven't been possible in the past.The CRISPR technology has already been used to change the DNA in the cells of mice and monkeys, other organisms as well. Chinese scientists showed recently that they could even use the CRISPR technology to change genes in human embryos. And scientists in Philadelphia showed they could use CRISPR to remove the DNA of an integrated HIV virus from infected human cells.The opportunity to do this kind of genome editing also raises various ethical issues that we have to consider, because this technology can be employed not only in adult cells, but also in the embryos of organisms, including our own species. And so, together with my colleagues, I've called for a global conversation about the technology that I co-invented, so that we can consider all of the ethical and societal implications of a technology like this.What I want to do now is tell you what the CRISPR technology is, what it can do, where we are today and why I think we need to take a prudent path forward in the way that we employ this technology.When viruses infect a cell, they inject their DNA. And in a bacterium, the CRISPR system allows that DNA to be plucked out of the virus, and inserted in little bits into the chromosome \u2014 the DNA of the bacterium. And these integrated bits of viral DNA get inserted at a site called CRISPR. CRISPR stands for clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats. (Laughter)A big mouthful \u2014 you can see why we use the acronym CRISPR. It's a mechanism that allows cells to record, over time, the viruses they have been exposed to. And importantly, those bits of DNA are passed on to the cells' progeny, so cells are protected from viruses not only in one generation, but over many generations of cells. This allows the cells to keep a record of infection, and as my colleague, Blake Wiedenheft, likes to say, the CRISPR locus is effectively a genetic vaccination card in cells. Once those bits of DNA have been inserted into the bacterial chromosome, the cell then makes a little copy of a molecule called RNA, which is orange in this picture, that is an exact replicate of the viral DNA. RNA is a chemical cousin of DNA, and it allows interaction with DNA molecules that have a matching sequence.So those little bits of RNA from the CRISPR locus associate \u2014 they bind \u2014 to protein called Cas9, which is white in the picture, and form a complex that functions like a sentinel in the cell. It searches through all of the DNA in the cell, to find sites that match the sequences in the bound RNAs. And when those sites are found \u2014 as you can see here, the blue molecule is DNA \u2014 this complex associates with that DNA and allows the Cas9 cleaver to cut up the viral DNA. It makes a very precise break. So we can think of the Cas9 RNA sentinel complex like a pair of scissors that can cut DNA \u2014 it makes a double-stranded break in the DNA helix. And importantly, this complex is programmable, so it can be programmed to recognize particular DNA sequences, and make a break in the DNA at that site.As I'm going to tell you now, we recognized that that activity could be harnessed for genome engineering, to allow cells to make a very precise change to the DNA at the site where this break was introduced. That's sort of analogous to the way that we use a word-processing program to fix a typo in a document.The reason we envisioned using the CRISPR system for genome engineering is because cells have the ability to detect broken DNA and repair it. So when a plant or an animal cell detects a double-stranded break in its DNA, it can fix that break, either by pasting together the ends of the broken DNA with a little, tiny change in the sequence of that position, or it can repair the break by integrating a new piece of DNA at the site of the cut. So if we have a way to introduce double-stranded breaks into DNA at precise places, we can trigger cells to repair those breaks, by either the disruption or incorporation of new genetic information. So if we were able to program the CRISPR technology to make a break in DNA at the position at or near a mutation causing cystic fibrosis, for example, we could trigger cells to repair that mutation.Genome engineering is actually not new, it's been in development since the 1970s. We've had technologies for sequencing DNA, for copying DNA, and even for manipulating DNA. And these technologies were very promising, but the problem was that they were either inefficient, or they were difficult enough to use that most scientists had not adopted them for use in their own laboratories, or certainly for many clinical applications. So, the opportunity to take a technology like CRISPR and utilize it has appeal, because of its relative simplicity. We can think of older genome engineering technologies as similar to having to rewire your computer each time you want to run a new piece of software, whereas the CRISPR technology is like software for the genome, we can program it easily, using these little bits of RNA.So once a double-stranded break is made in DNA, we can induce repair, and thereby potentially achieve astounding things, like being able to correct mutations that cause sickle cell anemia or cause Huntington's Disease. I actually think that the first applications of the CRISPR technology are going to happen in the blood, where it's relatively easier to deliver this tool into cells, compared to solid tissues.Right now, a lot of the work that's going on applies to animal models of human disease, such as mice. The technology is being used to make very precise changes that allow us to study the way that these changes in the cell's DNA affect either a tissue or, in this case, an entire organism.Now in this example, the CRISPR technology was used to disrupt a gene by making a tiny change in the DNA in a gene that is responsible for the black coat color of these mice. Imagine that these white mice differ from their pigmented litter-mates by just a tiny change at one gene in the entire genome, and they're otherwise completely normal. And when we sequence the DNA from these animals, we find that the change in the DNA has occurred at exactly the place where we induced it, using the CRISPR technology.Additional experiments are going on in other animals that are useful for creating models for human disease, such as monkeys. And here we find that we can use these systems to test the application of this technology in particular tissues, for example, figuring out how to deliver the CRISPR tool into cells. We also want to understand better how to control the way that DNA is repaired after it's cut, and also to figure out how to control and limit any kind of off-target, or unintended effects of using the technology.I think that we will see clinical application of this technology, certainly in adults, within the next 10 years. I think that it's likely that we will see clinical trials and possibly even approved therapies within that time, which is a very exciting thing to think about. And because of the excitement around this technology, there's a lot of interest in start-up companies that have been founded to commercialize the CRISPR technology, and lots of venture capitalists that have been investing in these companies.But we have to also consider that the CRISPR technology can be used for things like enhancement. Imagine that we could try to engineer humans that have enhanced properties, such as stronger bones, or less susceptibility to cardiovascular disease or even to have properties that we would consider maybe to be desirable, like a different eye color or to be taller, things like that. \"Designer humans,\" if you will. Right now, the genetic information to understand what types of genes would give rise to these traits is mostly not known. But it's important to know that the CRISPR technology gives us a tool to make such changes, once that knowledge becomes available.This raises a number of ethical questions that we have to carefully consider, and this is why I and my colleagues have called for a global pause in any clinical application of the CRISPR technology in human embryos, to give us time to really consider all of the various implications of doing so. And actually, there is an important precedent for such a pause from the 1970s, when scientists got together to call for a moratorium on the use of molecular cloning, until the safety of that technology could be tested carefully and validated.So, genome-engineered humans are not with us yet, but this is no longer science fiction. Genome-engineered animals and plants are happening right now. And this puts in front of all of us a huge responsibility, to consider carefully both the unintended consequences as well as the intended impacts of a scientific breakthrough.Thank you.(Applause)(Applause ends)Bruno Giussani: Jennifer, this is a technology with huge consequences, as you pointed out. Your attitude about asking for a pause or a moratorium or a quarantine is incredibly responsible. There are, of course, the therapeutic results of this, but then there are the un-therapeutic ones and they seem to be the ones gaining traction, particularly in the media. This is one of the latest issues of The Economist \u2014 \"Editing humanity.\" It's all about genetic enhancement, it's not about therapeutics. What kind of reactions did you get back in March from your colleagues in the science world, when you asked or suggested that we should actually pause this for a moment and think about it?Jennifer Doudna: My colleagues were actually, I think, delighted to have the opportunity to discuss this openly. It's interesting that as I talk to people, my scientific colleagues as well as others, there's a wide variety of viewpoints about this. So clearly it's a topic that needs careful consideration and discussion.BG: There's a big meeting happening in December that you and your colleagues are calling, together with the National Academy of Sciences and others, what do you hope will come out of the meeting, practically?JD: Well, I hope that we can air the views of many different individuals and stakeholders who want to think about how to use this technology responsibly. It may not be possible to come up with a consensus point of view, but I think we should at least understand what all the issues are as we go forward.BG: Now, colleagues of yours, like George Church, for example, at Harvard, they say, \"Yeah, ethical issues basically are just a question of safety. We test and test and test again, in animals and in labs, and then once we feel it's safe enough, we move on to humans.\" So that's kind of the other school of thought, that we should actually use this opportunity and really go for it. Is there a possible split happening in the science community about this? I mean, are we going to see some people holding back because they have ethical concerns, and some others just going forward because some countries under-regulate or don't regulate at all?JD: Well, I think with any new technology, especially something like this, there are going to be a variety of viewpoints, and I think that's perfectly understandable. I think that in the end, this technology will be used for human genome engineering, but I think to do that without careful consideration and discussion of the risks and potential complications would not be responsible.BG: There are a lot of technologies and other fields of science that are developing exponentially, pretty much like yours. I'm thinking about artificial intelligence, autonomous robots and so on. No one seems \u2014 aside from autonomous warfare robots \u2014 nobody seems to have launched a similar discussion in those fields, in calling for a moratorium. Do you think that your discussion may serve as a blueprint for other fields?JD: Well, I think it's hard for scientists to get out of the laboratory. Speaking for myself, it's a little bit uncomfortable to do that. But I do think that being involved in the genesis of this really puts me and my colleagues in a position of responsibility. And I would say that I certainly hope that other technologies will be considered in the same way, just as we would want to consider something that could have implications in other fields besides biology.BG: Jennifer, thanks for coming to TED.JD: Thank you.(Applause)", "id": 2354, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:13.261 --> 00:00:14.421\nA few years ago,\n\n00:00:14.445 --> 00:00:17.215\nwith my colleague, Emmanuelle Charpentier,\n\n00:00:17.239 --> 00:00:20.497\nI invented a new technology\nfor editing genomes.\n\n00:00:21.051 --> 00:00:23.165\nIt's called CRISPR-Cas9.\n\n00:00:23.828 --> 00:00:27.404\nThe CRISPR technology allows\nscientists to make changes\n\n00:00:27.428 --> 00:00:29.283\nto the DNA in cells\n\n00:00:29.307 --> 00:00:32.213\nthat could allow us\nto cure genetic disease.\n\n00:00:33.154 --> 00:00:34.646\nYou might be interested to know\n\n00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:38.454\nthat the CRISPR technology came about\nthrough a basic research project\n\n00:00:38.478 --> 00:00:42.421\nthat was aimed at discovering\nhow bacteria fight viral infections.\n\n00:00:43.298 --> 00:00:46.170\nBacteria have to deal with viruses\nin their environment,\n\n00:00:46.194 --> 00:00:49.858\nand we can think about a viral infection\nlike a ticking time bomb --\n\n00:00:49.882 --> 00:00:53.240\na bacterium has only a few minutes\nto defuse the bomb\n\n00:00:53.264 --> 00:00:54.874\nbefore it gets destroyed.\n\n00:00:55.242 --> 00:01:00.632\nSo, many bacteria have in their cells\nan adaptive immune system called CRISPR,\n\n00:01:00.656 --> 00:01:04.302\nthat allows them to detect\nviral DNA and destroy it.\n\n00:01:05.106 --> 00:01:09.074\nPart of the CRISPR system\nis a protein called Cas9,\n\n00:01:09.098 --> 00:01:15.047\nthat's able to seek out, cut\nand eventually degrade viral DNA\n\n00:01:15.071 --> 00:01:16.333\nin a specific way.\n\n00:01:17.012 --> 00:01:18.514\nAnd it was through our research\n\n00:01:18.538 --> 00:01:22.195\nto understand the activity\nof this protein, Cas9,\n\n00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:25.050\nthat we realized that we could\nharness its function\n\n00:01:25.074 --> 00:01:28.480\nas a genetic engineering technology --\n\n00:01:28.504 --> 00:01:35.455\na way for scientists to delete or insert\nspecific bits of DNA into cells\n\n00:01:35.479 --> 00:01:37.510\nwith incredible precision --\n\n00:01:37.534 --> 00:01:39.201\nthat would offer opportunities\n\n00:01:39.225 --> 00:01:42.297\nto do things that really haven't\nbeen possible in the past.\n\n00:01:43.142 --> 00:01:45.204\nThe CRISPR technology\nhas already been used\n\n00:01:45.228 --> 00:01:50.312\nto change the DNA in the cells\nof mice and monkeys,\n\n00:01:50.336 --> 00:01:51.961\nother organisms as well.\n\n00:01:52.485 --> 00:01:54.240\nChinese scientists showed recently\n\n00:01:54.264 --> 00:01:56.423\nthat they could even use\nthe CRISPR technology\n\n00:01:56.447 --> 00:01:59.076\nto change genes in human embryos.\n\n00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:02.243\nAnd scientists in Philadelphia showed\nthey could use CRISPR\n\n00:02:02.267 --> 00:02:07.110\nto remove the DNA\nof an integrated HIV virus\n\n00:02:07.134 --> 00:02:09.329\nfrom infected human cells.\n\n00:02:10.175 --> 00:02:13.306\nThe opportunity to do this kind\nof genome editing\n\n00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:16.613\nalso raises various ethical issues\nthat we have to consider,\n\n00:02:16.637 --> 00:02:20.605\nbecause this technology can be employed\nnot only in adult cells,\n\n00:02:20.629 --> 00:02:23.232\nbut also in the embryos of organisms,\n\n00:02:23.256 --> 00:02:26.256\nincluding our own species.\n\n00:02:26.725 --> 00:02:28.723\nAnd so, together with my colleagues,\n\n00:02:28.747 --> 00:02:33.235\nI've called for a global conversation\nabout the technology that I co-invented,\n\n00:02:33.259 --> 00:02:37.799\nso that we can consider all of the ethical\nand societal implications\n\n00:02:37.823 --> 00:02:39.547\nof a technology like this.\n\n00:02:40.014 --> 00:02:44.953\nWhat I want to do now is tell you\nwhat the CRISPR technology is,\n\n00:02:44.977 --> 00:02:46.431\nwhat it can do,\n\n00:02:46.455 --> 00:02:47.700\nwhere we are today\n\n00:02:47.724 --> 00:02:50.746\nand why I think we need to take\na prudent path forward\n\n00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:53.123\nin the way that we employ this technology.\n\n00:02:55.043 --> 00:02:58.789\nWhen viruses infect a cell,\nthey inject their DNA.\n\n00:02:59.321 --> 00:03:00.797\nAnd in a bacterium,\n\n00:03:00.821 --> 00:03:05.686\nthe CRISPR system allows that DNA\nto be plucked out of the virus,\n\n00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:09.555\nand inserted in little bits\ninto the chromosome --\n\n00:03:09.579 --> 00:03:11.529\nthe DNA of the bacterium.\n\n00:03:11.895 --> 00:03:17.245\nAnd these integrated bits of viral DNA\nget inserted at a site called CRISPR.\n\n00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:23.985\nCRISPR stands for clustered regularly\ninterspaced short palindromic repeats.\n\n00:03:24.009 --> 00:03:25.010\n(Laughter)\n\n00:03:25.034 --> 00:03:28.407\nA big mouthful -- you can see why\nwe use the acronym CRISPR.\n\n00:03:28.848 --> 00:03:32.836\nIt's a mechanism that allows cells\nto record, over time,\n\n00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:35.542\nthe viruses they have been exposed to.\n\n00:03:35.566 --> 00:03:40.249\nAnd importantly, those bits of DNA\nare passed on to the cells' progeny,\n\n00:03:40.273 --> 00:03:44.806\nso cells are protected from viruses\nnot only in one generation,\n\n00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:47.179\nbut over many generations of cells.\n\n00:03:47.203 --> 00:03:51.488\nThis allows the cells\nto keep a record of infection,\n\n00:03:51.512 --> 00:03:54.451\nand as my colleague,\nBlake Wiedenheft, likes to say,\n\n00:03:54.475 --> 00:03:59.431\nthe CRISPR locus is effectively\na genetic vaccination card in cells.\n\n00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:05.028\nOnce those bits of DNA have been inserted\ninto the bacterial chromosome,\n\n00:04:05.052 --> 00:04:09.251\nthe cell then makes a little copy\nof a molecule called RNA,\n\n00:04:09.275 --> 00:04:11.290\nwhich is orange in this picture,\n\n00:04:11.314 --> 00:04:16.031\nthat is an exact replicate\nof the viral DNA.\n\n00:04:16.460 --> 00:04:18.796\nRNA is a chemical cousin of DNA,\n\n00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:22.773\nand it allows interaction\nwith DNA molecules\n\n00:04:22.797 --> 00:04:24.796\nthat have a matching sequence.\n\n00:04:25.216 --> 00:04:29.125\nSo those little bits of RNA\nfrom the CRISPR locus\n\n00:04:29.149 --> 00:04:32.938\nassociate -- they bind --\nto protein called Cas9,\n\n00:04:32.962 --> 00:04:34.897\nwhich is white in the picture,\n\n00:04:34.921 --> 00:04:39.140\nand form a complex that functions\nlike a sentinel in the cell.\n\n00:04:39.164 --> 00:04:42.578\nIt searches through all\nof the DNA in the cell,\n\n00:04:42.602 --> 00:04:46.854\nto find sites that match\nthe sequences in the bound RNAs.\n\n00:04:46.878 --> 00:04:48.513\nAnd when those sites are found --\n\n00:04:48.537 --> 00:04:52.007\nas you can see here,\nthe blue molecule is DNA --\n\n00:04:52.031 --> 00:04:54.880\nthis complex associates with that DNA\n\n00:04:54.904 --> 00:05:00.206\nand allows the Cas9 cleaver\nto cut up the viral DNA.\n\n00:05:00.230 --> 00:05:02.586\nIt makes a very precise break.\n\n00:05:04.054 --> 00:05:08.454\nSo we can think of the Cas9 RNA\nsentinel complex\n\n00:05:08.478 --> 00:05:11.659\nlike a pair of scissors\nthat can cut DNA --\n\n00:05:11.683 --> 00:05:14.919\nit makes a double-stranded break\nin the DNA helix.\n\n00:05:14.943 --> 00:05:18.925\nAnd importantly,\nthis complex is programmable,\n\n00:05:18.949 --> 00:05:24.149\nso it can be programmed to recognize\nparticular DNA sequences,\n\n00:05:24.173 --> 00:05:27.200\nand make a break in the DNA at that site.\n\n00:05:27.886 --> 00:05:29.466\nAs I'm going to tell you now,\n\n00:05:29.490 --> 00:05:34.266\nwe recognized that that activity\ncould be harnessed for genome engineering,\n\n00:05:34.290 --> 00:05:38.517\nto allow cells to make\na very precise change to the DNA\n\n00:05:38.541 --> 00:05:41.013\nat the site where\nthis break was introduced.\n\n00:05:41.516 --> 00:05:42.731\nThat's sort of analogous\n\n00:05:42.755 --> 00:05:45.463\nto the way that we use\na word-processing program\n\n00:05:45.487 --> 00:05:47.767\nto fix a typo in a document.\n\n00:05:49.499 --> 00:05:54.317\nThe reason we envisioned using\nthe CRISPR system for genome engineering\n\n00:05:54.341 --> 00:05:57.960\nis because cells have the ability\nto detect broken DNA\n\n00:05:57.984 --> 00:05:59.176\nand repair it.\n\n00:05:59.738 --> 00:06:04.669\nSo when a plant or an animal cell detects\na double-stranded break in its DNA,\n\n00:06:04.693 --> 00:06:06.290\nit can fix that break,\n\n00:06:06.314 --> 00:06:09.841\neither by pasting together\nthe ends of the broken DNA\n\n00:06:09.865 --> 00:06:13.975\nwith a little, tiny change\nin the sequence of that position,\n\n00:06:13.999 --> 00:06:20.282\nor it can repair the break by integrating\na new piece of DNA at the site of the cut.\n\n00:06:21.012 --> 00:06:25.985\nSo if we have a way to introduce\ndouble-stranded breaks into DNA\n\n00:06:26.009 --> 00:06:27.589\nat precise places,\n\n00:06:27.613 --> 00:06:30.422\nwe can trigger cells\nto repair those breaks,\n\n00:06:30.446 --> 00:06:35.469\nby either the disruption or incorporation\nof new genetic information.\n\n00:06:35.894 --> 00:06:39.136\nSo if we were able to program\nthe CRISPR technology\n\n00:06:39.160 --> 00:06:41.483\nto make a break in DNA\n\n00:06:41.507 --> 00:06:47.776\nat the position at or near a mutation\ncausing cystic fibrosis, for example,\n\n00:06:47.800 --> 00:06:51.305\nwe could trigger cells\nto repair that mutation.\n\n00:06:52.422 --> 00:06:57.525\nGenome engineering is actually not new,\nit's been in development since the 1970s.\n\n00:06:57.549 --> 00:07:00.300\nWe've had technologies for sequencing DNA,\n\n00:07:00.324 --> 00:07:01.919\nfor copying DNA,\n\n00:07:01.943 --> 00:07:04.323\nand even for manipulating DNA.\n\n00:07:04.927 --> 00:07:08.063\nAnd these technologies\nwere very promising,\n\n00:07:08.087 --> 00:07:12.493\nbut the problem was\nthat they were either inefficient,\n\n00:07:12.517 --> 00:07:14.850\nor they were difficult enough to use\n\n00:07:14.874 --> 00:07:19.676\nthat most scientists had not adopted them\nfor use in their own laboratories,\n\n00:07:19.700 --> 00:07:23.865\nor certainly for many\nclinical applications.\n\n00:07:24.680 --> 00:07:31.680\nSo, the opportunity to take a technology\nlike CRISPR and utilize it has appeal,\n\n00:07:32.059 --> 00:07:35.060\nbecause of its relative simplicity.\n\n00:07:35.084 --> 00:07:38.853\nWe can think of older\ngenome engineering technologies\n\n00:07:38.877 --> 00:07:42.536\nas similar to having\nto rewire your computer\n\n00:07:42.560 --> 00:07:46.330\neach time you want to run\na new piece of software,\n\n00:07:46.354 --> 00:07:50.118\nwhereas the CRISPR technology\nis like software for the genome,\n\n00:07:50.142 --> 00:07:53.628\nwe can program it easily,\nusing these little bits of RNA.\n\n00:07:54.616 --> 00:07:57.709\nSo once a double-stranded\nbreak is made in DNA,\n\n00:07:57.733 --> 00:07:59.820\nwe can induce repair,\n\n00:07:59.844 --> 00:08:03.290\nand thereby potentially achieve\nastounding things,\n\n00:08:03.314 --> 00:08:07.473\nlike being able to correct mutations\nthat cause sickle cell anemia\n\n00:08:07.497 --> 00:08:09.848\nor cause Huntington's Disease.\n\n00:08:09.872 --> 00:08:13.333\nI actually think that the first\napplications of the CRISPR technology\n\n00:08:13.357 --> 00:08:15.626\nare going to happen in the blood,\n\n00:08:15.650 --> 00:08:20.403\nwhere it's relatively easier\nto deliver this tool into cells,\n\n00:08:20.427 --> 00:08:22.548\ncompared to solid tissues.\n\n00:08:23.863 --> 00:08:26.267\nRight now, a lot of the work\nthat's going on\n\n00:08:26.291 --> 00:08:30.260\napplies to animal models\nof human disease, such as mice.\n\n00:08:30.284 --> 00:08:33.553\nThe technology is being used to make\nvery precise changes\n\n00:08:33.577 --> 00:08:38.748\nthat allow us to study the way\nthat these changes in the cell's DNA\n\n00:08:38.772 --> 00:08:43.092\naffect either a tissue or,\nin this case, an entire organism.\n\n00:08:43.473 --> 00:08:44.680\nNow in this example,\n\n00:08:44.704 --> 00:08:48.497\nthe CRISPR technology\nwas used to disrupt a gene\n\n00:08:48.521 --> 00:08:51.288\nby making a tiny change in the DNA\n\n00:08:51.312 --> 00:08:55.756\nin a gene that is responsible\nfor the black coat color of these mice.\n\n00:08:56.177 --> 00:09:01.195\nImagine that these white mice\ndiffer from their pigmented litter-mates\n\n00:09:01.219 --> 00:09:05.886\nby just a tiny change at one gene\nin the entire genome,\n\n00:09:05.910 --> 00:09:07.900\nand they're otherwise completely normal.\n\n00:09:07.924 --> 00:09:10.815\nAnd when we sequence the DNA\nfrom these animals,\n\n00:09:10.839 --> 00:09:13.465\nwe find that the change in the DNA\n\n00:09:13.489 --> 00:09:16.631\nhas occurred at exactly the place\nwhere we induced it,\n\n00:09:16.655 --> 00:09:18.417\nusing the CRISPR technology.\n\n00:09:19.620 --> 00:09:22.344\nAdditional experiments\nare going on in other animals\n\n00:09:22.368 --> 00:09:26.463\nthat are useful for creating models\nfor human disease,\n\n00:09:26.487 --> 00:09:28.090\nsuch as monkeys.\n\n00:09:28.114 --> 00:09:31.340\nAnd here we find\nthat we can use these systems\n\n00:09:31.364 --> 00:09:35.166\nto test the application of this technology\nin particular tissues,\n\n00:09:35.190 --> 00:09:40.263\nfor example, figuring out how to deliver\nthe CRISPR tool into cells.\n\n00:09:40.287 --> 00:09:42.435\nWe also want to understand better\n\n00:09:42.459 --> 00:09:46.086\nhow to control the way\nthat DNA is repaired after it's cut,\n\n00:09:46.110 --> 00:09:51.791\nand also to figure out how to control\nand limit any kind of off-target,\n\n00:09:51.815 --> 00:09:55.052\nor unintended effects\nof using the technology.\n\n00:09:56.314 --> 00:10:02.464\nI think that we will see\nclinical application of this technology,\n\n00:10:02.488 --> 00:10:04.000\ncertainly in adults,\n\n00:10:04.024 --> 00:10:05.627\nwithin the next 10 years.\n\n00:10:05.651 --> 00:10:08.785\nI think that it's likely\nthat we will see clinical trials\n\n00:10:08.809 --> 00:10:12.238\nand possibly even approved\ntherapies within that time,\n\n00:10:12.262 --> 00:10:14.975\nwhich is a very exciting thing\nto think about.\n\n00:10:14.999 --> 00:10:17.500\nAnd because of the excitement\naround this technology,\n\n00:10:17.524 --> 00:10:20.817\nthere's a lot of interest\nin start-up companies\n\n00:10:20.841 --> 00:10:25.603\nthat have been founded\nto commercialize the CRISPR technology,\n\n00:10:25.627 --> 00:10:27.116\nand lots of venture capitalists\n\n00:10:27.140 --> 00:10:29.712\nthat have been investing\nin these companies.\n\n00:10:31.200 --> 00:10:32.773\nBut we have to also consider\n\n00:10:32.797 --> 00:10:36.419\nthat the CRISPR technology can be used\nfor things like enhancement.\n\n00:10:36.443 --> 00:10:39.487\nImagine that we could try\nto engineer humans\n\n00:10:39.511 --> 00:10:43.946\nthat have enhanced properties,\nsuch as stronger bones,\n\n00:10:43.970 --> 00:10:48.041\nor less susceptibility\nto cardiovascular disease\n\n00:10:48.065 --> 00:10:49.576\nor even to have properties\n\n00:10:49.600 --> 00:10:51.999\nthat we would consider maybe\nto be desirable,\n\n00:10:52.023 --> 00:10:56.464\nlike a different eye color\nor to be taller, things like that.\n\n00:10:57.900 --> 00:10:59.746\n\"Designer humans,\" if you will.\n\n00:11:00.738 --> 00:11:03.128\nRight now, the genetic information\n\n00:11:03.152 --> 00:11:07.645\nto understand what types of genes\nwould give rise to these traits\n\n00:11:07.669 --> 00:11:09.402\nis mostly not known.\n\n00:11:09.426 --> 00:11:10.672\nBut it's important to know\n\n00:11:10.696 --> 00:11:14.981\nthat the CRISPR technology gives us a tool\nto make such changes,\n\n00:11:15.005 --> 00:11:17.512\nonce that knowledge becomes available.\n\n00:11:18.609 --> 00:11:22.720\nThis raises a number of ethical questions\nthat we have to carefully consider,\n\n00:11:22.744 --> 00:11:26.959\nand this is why I and my colleagues\nhave called for a global pause\n\n00:11:26.983 --> 00:11:31.729\nin any clinical application\nof the CRISPR technology in human embryos,\n\n00:11:31.753 --> 00:11:32.904\nto give us time\n\n00:11:32.928 --> 00:11:37.305\nto really consider all of the various\nimplications of doing so.\n\n00:11:37.701 --> 00:11:41.544\nAnd actually, there is an important\nprecedent for such a pause\n\n00:11:41.568 --> 00:11:42.887\nfrom the 1970s,\n\n00:11:42.911 --> 00:11:44.775\nwhen scientists got together\n\n00:11:44.799 --> 00:11:48.629\nto call for a moratorium\non the use of molecular cloning,\n\n00:11:48.653 --> 00:11:54.608\nuntil the safety of that technology\ncould be tested carefully and validated.\n\n00:11:55.464 --> 00:12:00.604\nSo, genome-engineered humans\nare not with us yet,\n\n00:12:00.628 --> 00:12:03.275\nbut this is no longer science fiction.\n\n00:12:04.137 --> 00:12:08.502\nGenome-engineered animals and plants\nare happening right now.\n\n00:12:09.027 --> 00:12:13.080\nAnd this puts in front of all of us\na huge responsibility,\n\n00:12:13.104 --> 00:12:17.681\nto consider carefully\nboth the unintended consequences\n\n00:12:17.705 --> 00:12:21.751\nas well as the intended impacts\nof a scientific breakthrough.\n\n00:12:22.148 --> 00:12:23.300\nThank you.\n\n00:12:23.324 --> 00:12:27.324\n(Applause)\n\n00:12:31.530 --> 00:12:32.693\n(Applause ends)\n\n00:12:33.493 --> 00:12:37.387\nBruno Giussani: Jennifer, this is\na technology with huge consequences,\n\n00:12:37.411 --> 00:12:38.562\nas you pointed out.\n\n00:12:38.586 --> 00:12:43.758\nYour attitude about asking for a pause\nor a moratorium or a quarantine\n\n00:12:43.782 --> 00:12:45.802\nis incredibly responsible.\n\n00:12:46.691 --> 00:12:49.239\nThere are, of course,\nthe therapeutic results of this,\n\n00:12:49.263 --> 00:12:51.413\nbut then there are the un-therapeutic ones\n\n00:12:51.437 --> 00:12:53.617\nand they seem to be the ones\ngaining traction,\n\n00:12:53.641 --> 00:12:54.887\nparticularly in the media.\n\n00:12:54.911 --> 00:12:59.077\nThis is one of the latest issues\nof The Economist -- \"Editing humanity.\"\n\n00:12:59.101 --> 00:13:02.920\nIt's all about genetic enhancement,\nit's not about therapeutics.\n\n00:13:03.499 --> 00:13:05.781\nWhat kind of reactions\ndid you get back in March\n\n00:13:05.805 --> 00:13:07.822\nfrom your colleagues in the science world,\n\n00:13:07.846 --> 00:13:09.204\nwhen you asked or suggested\n\n00:13:09.228 --> 00:13:12.544\nthat we should actually pause this\nfor a moment and think about it?\n\n00:13:13.012 --> 00:13:16.013\nJennifer Doudna: My colleagues\nwere actually, I think, delighted\n\n00:13:16.037 --> 00:13:18.282\nto have the opportunity\nto discuss this openly.\n\n00:13:18.306 --> 00:13:20.652\nIt's interesting that as I talk to people,\n\n00:13:20.676 --> 00:13:23.144\nmy scientific colleagues\nas well as others,\n\n00:13:23.168 --> 00:13:25.478\nthere's a wide variety\nof viewpoints about this.\n\n00:13:25.502 --> 00:13:29.176\nSo clearly it's a topic that needs\ncareful consideration and discussion.\n\n00:13:29.200 --> 00:13:31.415\nBG: There's a big meeting\nhappening in December\n\n00:13:31.439 --> 00:13:33.415\nthat you and your colleagues are calling,\n\n00:13:33.439 --> 00:13:36.206\ntogether with the National Academy\nof Sciences and others,\n\n00:13:36.230 --> 00:13:39.522\nwhat do you hope will come\nout of the meeting, practically?\n\n00:13:39.546 --> 00:13:41.912\nJD: Well, I hope that we can air the views\n\n00:13:41.936 --> 00:13:45.536\nof many different individuals\nand stakeholders\n\n00:13:45.560 --> 00:13:49.852\nwho want to think about how to use\nthis technology responsibly.\n\n00:13:49.876 --> 00:13:52.978\nIt may not be possible to come up with\na consensus point of view,\n\n00:13:53.002 --> 00:13:54.995\nbut I think we should at least understand\n\n00:13:55.019 --> 00:13:56.991\nwhat all the issues are as we go forward.\n\n00:13:57.015 --> 00:13:58.421\nBG: Now, colleagues of yours,\n\n00:13:58.445 --> 00:14:00.524\nlike George Church,\nfor example, at Harvard,\n\n00:14:00.548 --> 00:14:03.984\nthey say, \"Yeah, ethical issues basically\nare just a question of safety.\n\n00:14:04.008 --> 00:14:06.662\nWe test and test and test again,\nin animals and in labs,\n\n00:14:06.686 --> 00:14:10.602\nand then once we feel it's safe enough,\nwe move on to humans.\"\n\n00:14:10.626 --> 00:14:13.207\nSo that's kind of the other\nschool of thought,\n\n00:14:13.231 --> 00:14:16.379\nthat we should actually use\nthis opportunity and really go for it.\n\n00:14:16.403 --> 00:14:20.181\nIs there a possible split happening\nin the science community about this?\n\n00:14:20.205 --> 00:14:22.665\nI mean, are we going to see\nsome people holding back\n\n00:14:22.689 --> 00:14:24.483\nbecause they have ethical concerns,\n\n00:14:24.507 --> 00:14:26.194\nand some others just going forward\n\n00:14:26.218 --> 00:14:29.514\nbecause some countries under-regulate\nor don't regulate at all?\n\n00:14:29.538 --> 00:14:33.383\nJD: Well, I think with any new technology,\nespecially something like this,\n\n00:14:33.407 --> 00:14:36.192\nthere are going to be\na variety of viewpoints,\n\n00:14:36.216 --> 00:14:39.557\nand I think that's\nperfectly understandable.\n\n00:14:39.581 --> 00:14:41.093\nI think that in the end,\n\n00:14:41.117 --> 00:14:46.068\nthis technology will be used\nfor human genome engineering,\n\n00:14:46.092 --> 00:14:50.409\nbut I think to do that without careful\nconsideration and discussion\n\n00:14:50.433 --> 00:14:53.370\nof the risks and potential complications\n\n00:14:53.394 --> 00:14:54.933\nwould not be responsible.\n\n00:14:54.957 --> 00:14:57.936\nBG: There are a lot of technologies\nand other fields of science\n\n00:14:57.960 --> 00:15:00.731\nthat are developing exponentially,\npretty much like yours.\n\n00:15:00.755 --> 00:15:04.788\nI'm thinking about artificial\nintelligence, autonomous robots and so on.\n\n00:15:05.157 --> 00:15:06.324\nNo one seems --\n\n00:15:06.348 --> 00:15:08.856\naside from autonomous warfare robots --\n\n00:15:08.880 --> 00:15:13.585\nnobody seems to have launched\na similar discussion in those fields,\n\n00:15:13.609 --> 00:15:15.019\nin calling for a moratorium.\n\n00:15:15.043 --> 00:15:19.114\nDo you think that your discussion may\nserve as a blueprint for other fields?\n\n00:15:19.138 --> 00:15:22.657\nJD: Well, I think it's hard for scientists\nto get out of the laboratory.\n\n00:15:22.681 --> 00:15:23.834\nSpeaking for myself,\n\n00:15:23.858 --> 00:15:26.474\nit's a little bit\nuncomfortable to do that.\n\n00:15:26.498 --> 00:15:30.412\nBut I do think that being involved\nin the genesis of this\n\n00:15:30.436 --> 00:15:34.292\nreally puts me and my colleagues\nin a position of responsibility.\n\n00:15:34.316 --> 00:15:37.746\nAnd I would say that I certainly hope\nthat other technologies\n\n00:15:37.770 --> 00:15:40.416\nwill be considered in the same way,\n\n00:15:40.440 --> 00:15:43.838\njust as we would want to consider\nsomething that could have implications\n\n00:15:43.862 --> 00:15:45.789\nin other fields besides biology.\n\n00:15:45.813 --> 00:15:47.765\nBG: Jennifer, thanks for coming to TED.\n\n00:15:47.789 --> 00:15:49.050\nJD: Thank

"https://www.ted.com/talks/tom_uglow_an_internet_without_screens_might_look_like_this", "transcript": "I'd like to start by asking you all to go to your happy place, please. Yes, your happy place, I know you've got one even if it's fake.(Laughter)OK, so, comfortable? Good.Now I'd like to you to mentally answer the following questions. Is there any strip lighting in your happy place? Any plastic tables? Polyester flooring? Mobile phones? No? I think we all know that our happy place is meant to be somewhere natural, outdoors \u2014 on a beach, fireside. We'll be reading or eating or knitting. And we're surrounded by natural light and organic elements. Natural things make us happy. And happiness is a great motivator; we strive for happiness. Perhaps that's why we're always redesigning everything, in the hopes that our solutions might feel more natural. So let's start there \u2014 with the idea that good design should feel natural.Your phone is not very natural. And you probably think you're addicted to your phone, but you're really not. We're not addicted to devices, we're addicted to the information that flows through them. I wonder how long you would be happy in your happy place without any information from the outside world. I'm interested in how we access that information, how we experience it. We're moving from a time of static information, held in books and libraries and bus stops, through a period of digital information, towards a period of fluid information, where your children will expect to be able to access anything, anywhere at any time, from quantum physics to medieval viticulture, from gender theory to tomorrow's weather, just like switching on a lightbulb \u2014 Imagine that.Humans also like simple tools. Your phone is not a very simple tool. A fork is a simple tool.(Laughter)And we don't like them made of plastic, in the same way I don't really like my phone very much \u2014 it's not how I want to experience information.I think there are better solutions than a world mediated by screens. I don't hate screens, but I don't feel \u2014 and I don't think any of us feel that good about how much time we spend slouched over them. Fortunately, the big tech companies seem to agree. They're actually heavily invested in touch and speech and gesture, and also in senses \u2014 things that can turn dumb objects, like cups, and imbue them with the magic of the Internet, potentially turning this digital cloud into something we might touch and move.The parents in crisis over screen time need physical digital toys teaching their kids to read, as well as family-safe app stores. And I think, actually, that's already really happening.Reality is richer than screens. For example, I love books. For me they are time machines \u2014 atoms and molecules bound in space, from the moment of their creation to the moment of my experience. But frankly, the content's identical on my phone. So what makes this a richer experience than a screen? I mean, scientifically. We need screens, of course. I'm going to show film, I need the enormous screen. But there's more than you can do with these magic boxes. Your phone is not the Internet's door bitch.(Laughter)We can build things \u2014 physical things, using physics and pixels, that can integrate the Internet into the world around us. And I'm going to show you a few examples of those.A while ago, I got to work with a design agency, Berg, on an exploration of what the Internet without screens might actually look like. And they showed us a range ways that light can work with simple senses and physical objects to really bring the Internet to life, to make it tangible. Like this wonderfully mechanical YouTube player. And this was an inspiration to me.Next I worked with the Japanese agency, AQ, on a research project into mental health. We wanted to create an object that could capture the subjective data around mood swings that's so essential to diagnosis. This object captures your touch, so you might press it very hard if you're angry, or stroke it if you're calm. It's like a digital emoji stick. And then you might revisit those moments later, and add context to them online. Most of all, we wanted to create an intimate, beautiful thing that could live in your pocket and be loved.The binoculars are actually a birthday present for the Sydney Opera House's 40th anniversary. Our friends at Tellart in Boston brought over a pair of street binoculars, the kind you might find on the Empire State Building, and they fitted them with 360-degree views of other iconic world heritage sights \u2014(Laughter)using Street View. And then we stuck them under the steps. So, they became this very physical, simple reappropriation, or like a portal to these other icons. So you might see Versailles or Shackleton's Hut. Basically, it's virtual reality circa 1955.(Laughter)In our office we use hacky sacks to exchange URLs. This is incredibly simple, it's like your Opal card. You basically put a website on the little chip in here, and then you do this and ... bosh! \u2014 the website appears on your phone. It's about 10 cents.Treehugger is a project that we're working on with Grumpy Sailor and Finch, here in Sydney. And I'm very excited about what might happen when you pull the phones apart and you put the bits into trees, and that my children might have an opportunity to visit an enchanted forest guided by a magic wand, where they could talk to digital fairies and ask them questions, and be asked questions in return. As you can see, we're at the cardboard stage with this one.(Laughter)But I'm very excited by the possibility of getting kids back outside without screens, but with all the powerful magic of the Internet at their fingertips. And we hope to have something like this working by the end of the year.So let's recap. Humans like natural solutions. Humans love information. Humans need simple tools. These principles should underpin how we design for the future, not just for the Internet. You may feel uncomfortable about the age of information that we're moving into. You may feel challenged, rather than simply excited. Guess what? Me too. It's a really extraordinary period of human history.We are the people that actually build our world, there are no artificial intelligences... yet.(Laughter)It's us \u2014 designers, architects, artists, engineers. And if we challenge ourselves, I think that actually we can have a happy place filled with the information we love that feels as natural and as simple as switching on lightbulb. And although it may seem inevitable, that what the public wants is watches and websites and widgets, maybe we could give a bit of thought to cork and light and hacky sacks.Thank you very much.(Applause)", "id": 2356, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:12.798 --> 00:00:16.878\nI'd like to start by asking you all\nto go to your happy place,

access\nthat information,\n\n00:01:35.798 --> 00:01:37.798\nhow we experience it.\n\n00:01:37.838 --> 00:01:41.838\nWe're moving from a time\nof static information,\n\n00:01:41.878 --> 00:01:44.838\nheld in books and libraries and bus stops,\n\n00:01:44.878 --> 00:01:47.118\nthrough a period of digital information,\n\n00:01:47.158 --> 00:01:49.398\ntowards a period of fluid information,\n\n00:01:49.438 --> 00:01:55.638\nwhere your children will expect to be able\nto access anything, anywhere at any time,\n\n00:01:55.678 --> 00:01:59.558\nfrom quantum physics\nto medieval viticulture,\n\n00:01:59.598 --> 00:02:03.438\nfrom gender theory to tomorrow's weather,\n\n00:02:03.478 --> 00:02:05.798\njust like switching on a lightbulb --\n\n00:02:06.638 --> 00:02:08.038\nImagine that.\n\n00:02:08.078 --> 00:02:10.758\nHumans also like simple tools.\n\n00:02:11.278 --> 00:02:14.398\nYour phone is not a very simple tool.\n\n00:02:14.438 --> 00:02:16.078\nA fork is a simple tool.\n\n00:02:16.118 --> 00:02:17.318\n(Laughter)\n\n00:02:17.358 --> 00:02:20.157\nAnd we don't like them made of plastic,\n\n00:02:20.198 --> 00:02:22.865\nin the same way I don't really like\nmy phone very much --\n\n00:02:22.889 --> 00:02:26.489\nit's not how I want\nto experience information.\n\n00:02:27.438 --> 00:02:31.518\nI think there are better solutions\nthan a world mediated by screens.\n\n00:02:31.558 --> 00:02:33.958\nI don't hate screens, but I don't feel --\n\n00:02:33.998 --> 00:02:35.998\nand I don't think any of us feel that good\n\n00:02:36.038 --> 00:02:38.678\nabout how much time\nwe spend slouched over them.\n\n00:02:40.118 --> 00:02:41.358\nFortunately,\n\n00:02:41.398 --> 00:02:43.160\nthe big tech companies seem to agree.\n\n00:02:43.198 --> 00:02:47.918\nThey're actually heavily invested\nin touch and speech and gesture,\n\n00:02:47.958 --> 00:02:49.718\nand also in senses --\n\n00:02:49.758 --> 00:02:52.478\nthings that can turn\ndumb objects, like cups,\n\n00:02:52.518 --> 00:02:56.318\nand imbue them with the magic\nof the Internet,\n\n00:02:56.358 --> 00:02:58.718\npotentially turning this digital cloud\n\n00:02:58.758 --> 00:03:01.318\ninto something we might touch and move.\n\n00:03:01.838 --> 00:03:04.438\nThe parents in crisis over screen time\n\n00:03:04.478 --> 00:03:07.598\nneed physical digital toys\nteaching their kids to read,\n\n00:03:07.638 --> 00:03:10.398\nas well as family-safe app stores.\n\n00:03:11.798 --> 00:03:14.638\nAnd I think, actually,\nthat's already really happening.\n\n00:03:15.678 --> 00:03:19.718\nReality is richer than screens.\n\n00:03:20.598 --> 00:03:23.518\nFor example, I love books.\n\n00:03:24.078 --> 00:03:29.398\nFor me they are time machines --\natoms and molecules bound in space,\n\n00:03:29.438 --> 00:03:33.398\nfrom the moment of their creation\nto the moment of my experience.\n\n00:03:33.438 --> 00:03:34.958\nBut frankly,\n\n00:03:34.998 --> 00:03:37.358\nthe content's identical on my phone.\n\n00:03:37.398 --> 00:03:41.718\nSo what makes this\na richer experience than a screen?\n\n00:03:41.758 --> 00:03:45.358\nI mean, scientifically.\n\n00:03:45.398 --> 00:03:47.238\nWe need screens, of course.\n\n00:03:47.278 --> 00:03:51.598\nI'm going to show film,\nI need the enormous screen.\n\n00:03:52.838 --> 00:03:56.358\nBut there's more than you can do\nwith these magic boxes.\n\n00:03:56.838 --> 00:03:59.598\nYour phone is not\nthe Internet's door bitch.\n\n00:03:59.638 --> 00:04:00.838\n(Laughter)\n\n00:04:00.878 --> 00:04:03.718\nWe can build things --\nphysical things,\n\n00:04:03.758 --> 00:04:06.238\nusing physics and pixels,\n\n00:04:06.278 --> 00:04:08.945\nthat can integrate the Internet\ninto the world around us.\n\n00:04:08.969 --> 00:04:11.489\nAnd I'm going to show you\na few examples of those.\n\n00:04:14.438 --> 00:04:17.358\nA while ago, I got to work\nwith a design agency, Berg,\n\n00:04:17.398 --> 00:04:22.198\non an exploration of what the Internet\nwithout screens might actually look like.\n\n00:04:22.238 --> 00:04:24.278\nAnd they showed us a range ways\n\n00:04:24.318 --> 00:04:29.237\nthat light can work with simple senses\nand physical objects\n\n00:04:29.278 --> 00:04:33.558\nto really bring the Internet to life,\nto make it tangible.\n\n00:04:33.598 --> 00:04:37.918\nLike this wonderfully mechanical\nYouTube player.\n\n00:04:38.518 --> 00:04:40.918\nAnd this was an inspiration to me.\n\n00:04:42.558 --> 00:04:45.478\nNext I worked with\nthe Japanese agency, AQ,\n\n00:04:45.518 --> 00:04:47.838\non a research project into mental health.\n\n00:04:47.878 --> 00:04:49.259\nWe wanted to create an object\n\n00:04:49.283 --> 00:04:52.998\nthat could capture the subjective data\naround mood swings\n\n00:04:53.038 --> 00:04:55.438\nthat's so essential to diagnosis.\n\n00:04:55.998 --> 00:04:58.078\nThis object captures your touch,\n\n00:04:58.118 --> 00:05:00.958\nso you might press it\nvery hard if you're angry,\n\n00:05:00.998 --> 00:05:03.118\nor stroke it if you're calm.\n\n00:05:03.158 --> 00:05:05.758\nIt's like a digital emoji stick.\n\n00:05:05.798 --> 00:05:08.958\nAnd then you might revisit\nthose moments later,\n\n00:05:08.998 --> 00:05:10.718\nand add context to them online.\n\n00:05:11.118 --> 00:05:12.598\nMost of all,\n\n00:05:12.638 --> 00:05:16.118\nwe wanted to create\nan intimate, beautiful thing\n\n00:05:16.158 --> 00:05:18.078\nthat could live in your pocket\n\n00:05:18.118 --> 00:05:19.318\nand be loved.\n\n00:05:20.711 --> 00:05:22.854\nThe binoculars are actually\na birthday present\n\n00:05:22.878 --> 00:05:25.021\nfor the Sydney Opera House's\n40th anniversary.\n\n00:05:25.045 --> 00:05:28.998\nOur friends at Tellart in Boston\nbrought over a pair of street binoculars,\n\n00:05:29.038 --> 00:05:31.515\nthe kind you might find\non the Empire State Building,\n\n00:05:31.539 --> 00:05:34.358\nand they fitted them with 360-degree views\n\n00:05:34.398 --> 00:05:36.998\nof other iconic world heritage sights --\n\n00:05:37.038 --> 00:05:38.718\n(Laughter)\n\n00:05:38.758 --> 00:05:40.758\nusing Street View.\n\n00:05:40.798 --> 00:05:43.838\nAnd then we stuck them under the steps.\n\n00:05:43.878 --> 00:05:48.558\nSo, they became this very physical,\nsimple reappropriation,\n\n00:05:48.598 --> 00:05:50.638\nor like a portal to these other icons.\n\n00:05:50.678 --> 00:05:53.598\nSo you might see Versailles\nor Shackleton's Hut.\n\n00:05:53.638 --> 00:05:56.678\nBasically, it's virtual\nreality circa 1955.\n\n00:05:56.718 --> 00:05:58.758\n(Laughter)\n\n00:05:59.398 --> 00:06:02.838\nIn our office we use\nhacky sacks to exchange URLs.\n\n00:06:02.878 --> 00:06:05.638\nThis is incredibly simple,\nit's like your Opal card.\n\n00:06:05.678 --> 00:06:09.438\nYou basically put a website\non the little chip in here,\n\n00:06:09.478 --> 00:06:12.998\nand then you do this and ... bosh! --\n\n00:06:13.038 --> 00:06:15.358\nthe website appears on your phone.\n\n00:06:15.398 --> 00:06:17.878\nIt's about 10 cents.\n\n00:06:17.918 --> 00:06:20.014\nTreehugger is a project\nthat we're working on\n\n00:06:20.038 --> 00:06:22.438\nwith Grumpy Sailor and Finch,\nhere in Sydney.\n\n00:06:22.478 --> 00:06:25.358\nAnd I'm very excited\nabout what might happen\n\n00:06:25.398 --> 00:06:29.198\nwhen you pull the phones apart\nand you put the bits into trees,\n\n00:06:29.238 --> 00:06:32.118\nand that my children\nmight have an opportunity\n\n00:06:32.158 --> 00:06:36.758\nto visit an enchanted forest\nguided by a magic wand,\n\n00:06:36.798 --> 00:06:39.798\nwhere they could talk to digital fairies\nand ask them questions,\n\n00:06:39.838 --> 00:06:42.038\nand be asked questions in return.\n\n00:06:42.078 --> 00:06:43.278\nAs you can see,\n\n00:06:43.318 --> 00:06:45.318\nwe're at the cardboard stage\nwith this one.\n\n00:06:45.358 --> 00:06:46.518\n(Laughter)\n\n00:06:46.558 --> 00:06:47.758\nBut I'm very excited\n\n00:06:47.798 --> 00:06:51.678\nby the possibility of getting kids\nback outside without screens,\n\n00:06:51.718 --> 00:06:55.638\nbut with all the powerful magic\nof the Internet at their fingertips.\n\n00:06:55.678 --> 00:06:59.798\nAnd we hope to have something like this\nworking by the end of the year.\n\n00:07:01.558 --> 00:07:03.238\nSo let's recap.\n\n00:07:03.798 --> 00:07:05.798\nHumans like natural solutions.\n\n00:07:05.838 --> 00:07:07.878\nHumans love information.\n\n00:07:07.918 --> 00:07:10.198\nHumans need simple tools.\n\n00:07:10.598 --> 00:07:15.558\nThese principles should underpin\nhow we design for the future,\n\n00:07:15.598 --> 00:07:17.478\nnot just for the Internet.\n\n00:07:17.998 --> 00:07:23.638\nYou may feel uncomfortable about the age\nof information that we're moving into.\n\n00:07:23.678 --> 00:07:28.118\nYou may feel challenged,\nrather than simply excited.\n\n00:07:28.158 --> 00:07:30.158\nGuess what? Me too.\n\n00:07:30.198 --> 00:07:34.038\nIt's a really extraordinary period\nof human history.\n\n00:07:35.798 --> 00:07:39.638\nWe are the people\nthat actually build our world,\n\n00:07:39.678 --> 00:07:41.924\nthere are no artificial intelligences...\n\n00:07:41.949 --> 00:07:43.373\nyet.\n\n00:07:43.398 --> 00:07:45.278\n(Laughter)\n\n00:07:45.318 --> 00:07:50.718\nIt's us -- designers, architects,\nartists, engineers.\n\n00:07:50.758 --> 00:07:53.238\nAnd if we challenge ourselves,\n\n00:07:53.278 --> 00:07:57.198\nI think that actually\nwe can have a happy place\n\n00:07:57.238 --> 00:07:59.718\nfilled with the information we love\n\n00:07:59.758 --> 00:08:04.558\nthat feels as natural and as simple\nas switching on lightbulb.\n\n00:08:04.598 --> 00:08:06.313\nAnd although it may seem inevitable,\n\n00:08:06.337 --> 00:08:11.678\nthat what the public wants\nis watches and websites and widgets,\n\n00:08:11.718 --> 00:08:17.878\nmaybe we could give a bit of thought\nto cork and light and hacky sacks.\n\n00:08:17.918 --> 00:08:19.238\nThank you very much.\n\n00:08:19.278 --> 00:08:21.678\n(Applause)"}, {"title": "Deep under the Earth's surface, discovering beauty and science", "duration": "877", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/francesco_sauro_deep_under_the_earth_s_surface_discovering_beauty_and_science", "transcript": "I would like to invite you to come along on a visit to a dark continent. It is the continent hidden under the surface of the earth. It is largely unexplored, poorly understood, and the stuff of legends. But it is made also of dramatic landscapes like this huge underground chamber, and it is rich with surprising biological and mineralogical worlds.Thanks to the efforts of intrepid voyagers in the last three centuries \u2014 actually, we know also thanks to satellite technology, of course \u2014 we know almost every single square meter of our planet's surface. However, we know still very little about what is hidden inside the earth. Because a cave landscape, like this deep shaft in Italy, is hidden, the potential of cave exploration \u2014 the geographical dimension \u2014 is poorly understood and unappreciated. Because we are creatures living on the surface, our perception of the inner side of the planet is in some ways skewed, as is that of the depth of the oceans or of the upper atmosphere.However, since systematic cave exploration started about one century ago, we know actually that caves exist in every continent of the world. A single cave system, like Mammoth Cave, which is in Kentucky, can be as long as more than 600 kilometers. And an abyss like Krubera Voronya, which is in the Caucasus region, actually the deepest cave explored in the world, can go as far as more than 2,000 meters below the surface. That means a journey of weeks for a cave explorer.Caves form in karstic regions. So karstic regions are areas of the world where the infiltrating water along cracks, fractures, can easily dissolve soluble lithologies, forming a drainage system of tunnels, conduits \u2014 a three-dimensional network, actually. Karstic regions cover almost 20 percent of the continents' surface, and we know actually that speleologists in the last 50 years have explored roughly 30,000 kilometers of cave passages around the world, which is a big number. But geologists have estimated that what is still missing, to be discovered and mapped, is something around 10 million kilometers.That means that for each meter of a cave that we already know, that we have explored, there are still some tens of kilometers of undiscovered passages. That means that this is really an endless continent, and we will never be able to explore it completely. And this estimation is made without considering other types of caves, like, for example, inside glaciers or even volcanic caves, which are not karstic, but are formed by lava flows. And if we have a look at other planets like, for example, Mars, you will see that this characteristic is not so specific of our home planet. However, I will show to you now that we do not need to go to Mars to explore alien worlds.I'm a speleologist, that means a cave explorer. And I started with this passion when I was really young in the mountains not far from my hometown in North Italy, in the karstic regions of the Alps and the Dolomites. But soon, the quest for exploration brought me to the farthest corner of the planet, searching for new potential entrances of this undiscovered continent. And in 2009, I had the opportunity to visit the tepui table mountains, which are in the Orinoco and Amazon basins. These massifs enchanted me from the first time I saw them. They are surrounded by vertical, vertiginous rock walls with silvery waterfalls that are lost in the forest. They really inspired in me a sense of wilderness, with a soul older than millions and millions of years. And this dramatic landscape inspired among other things also Conan Doyle's \"The Lost World\" novel in 1912. And they are, really, a lost world. Scientists consider those mountains as islands in time, being separated from the surrounding lowlands since tens of millions of years ago. They are surrounded by up to 1,000-meter-high walls, resembling a fortress, impregnable by humans. And, in fact, only a few of these mountains have been climbed and explored on their top.These mountains contain also a scientific paradox: They are made by quartz, which is a very common mineral on the earth's crust, and the rock made up by quartz is called quartzite, and quartzite is one of the hardest and least soluble minerals on earth. So we do not expect at all to find a cave there. Despite this, in the last 10 years, speleologists from Italy, Slovakia, Czech Republic, and, of course, Venezuela and Brazil, have explored several caves in this area. So how can it be possible?To understand this contradiction, we have to consider the time factor, because the history of the tepuis is extremely long, starting about 1.6 billion years ago with the formation of the rock, and then evolving with the uplift of the region 150 million years ago, after the disruption of the Pangaea supercontinent and the opening of the Atlantic Ocean. So you can imagine that the water had tens or even hundreds of millions of years to sculpt the strangest forms on the tepuis' surfaces, but also to open the fractures and form stone cities, rock cities, fields of towers which are characterized in the famous landscape of the tepuis. But nobody could have imagined what was happening inside a mountain in so long a time frame.And so I was focusing in 2010 on one of those massifs, the Auy\u00e1n-tepui, which is very famous because it hosts Angel Falls, which is the highest waterfall in the world \u2014 about 979 meters of vertical drop. And I was searching for hints of the existence of cave systems through satellite images, and finally we identified an area of collapses of the surface \u2014 so, big boulders, rock piles \u2014 and that means that there was a void below. It was a clear indication that there was something inside the mountain.So we did several attempts to reach this area, by land and with a helicopter, but it was really difficult because \u2014 you have to imagine that these mountains are covered by clouds most of the year, by fog. There are strong winds, and there are almost 4,000 millimeters of rainfall per year, so it's really, really difficult to find good conditions. And only in 2013 we finally landed on the spot and we started the exploration of the cave.The cave is huge. It's a huge network under the surface of the tepui plateau, and in only ten days of expedition, we explored more than 20 kilometers of cave passages. And it's a huge network of underground rivers, channels, big rooms, extremely deep shafts.So it's really an incredible place. And we named it Imawar\u00ec Yeuta. That means, in the Pem\u00f3n indigenous language, \"The House of the Gods.\" You have to imagine that indigenous people have never been there. It was impossible for them to reach this area. However, there were legends about the existence of a cave in the mountain. So when we started the exploration, we had to explore with a great respect, both because of the religious beliefs of the indigenous people, but also because it was really a sacred place, because no human had entered there before. So we had to use special protocols to not contaminate the environment with our presence, and we tried also to share with the community, with the indigenous community, our discoveries.And the caves represent, really, a snapshot of the past. The time needed for their formation could be as long as 50 or even 100 million years, which makes them possibly the oldest caves that we can explore on earth. What you can find there is really evidence of a lost world.When you enter a quartzite cave, you have to completely forget what you know about caves \u2014 classic limestone caves or the touristic caves that you can visit in several places in the world. Because what seems a simple stalactite here is not made by calcium carbonate, but is made by opal, and one of those stalactites can require tens of millions of years to be formed. But you can find even stranger forms, like these mushrooms of silica growing on a boulder. And you can imagine our talks when we were exploring the cave. We were the first entering and discovering those unknown things, things like those monster eggs. And we were a bit scared because it was all a discovery, and we didn't want to find a dinosaur. We didn't find a dinosaur.(Laughter)Anyway, actually, we know that this kind of formation, after several studies, we know that these kinds of formations are living organisms. They are bacterial colonies using silica to build mineral structures resembling stromatolites. Stromatolites are some of the oldest forms of life that we can find on earth. And here in the tepuis, the interesting thing is that these bacteria colonies have evolved in complete isolation from the external surface, and without being in contact with humans. They have never been in contact with humans. So the implications for science are enormous, because here you could find, for example, microbes that could be useful to resolve diseases in medicine, or you could find even a new kind of material with unknown properties. And, in fact, we discovered in the cave a new mineral structure for science, which is rossiantonite, a phosphate-sulfate.So whatever you find in the cave, even a small cricket, has evolved in the dark in complete isolation. And, really, everything that you can feel in the cave are real connections between the biological and the mineralogical world. So as we explore this dark continent and discover its mineralogical and biological diversity and uniqueness, we will find probably clues about the origin of life on our planet and on the relationship and evolution of life in relationship with the mineral world. What seems only a dark, empty environment could be in reality a chest of wonders full of useful information.With a team of Italian, Venezuelan and Brazilian speleologists, which is called La Venta Teraphosa, we will be back soon to Latin America, because we want to explore other tepuis in the farthest areas of the Amazon. There are still very unknown mountains, like Marahuaca, which is almost 3,000 meters high above sea level, or Arac\u00e0, which is in the upper region of Rio Negro in Brazil. And we suppose that we could find there even bigger cave systems, and each one with its own undiscovered world.Thank you.(Applause)Bruno Giussani: Thank you, Francesco. Give me that to start so we don't forget. Francesco, you said we don't need to go to Mars to find alien life, and indeed, last time we spoke, you were in Sardinia and you were training European astronauts. So what do you, a speleologist, tell and teach to the astronauts?Francesco Sauro: Yeah, we are \u2014 it's a program of training for not only European, but also NASA, Roskosmos, JAXA astronauts, in a cave. So they stay in a cave for about one week in isolation. They have to work together in a real, real dangerous environment, and it's a real alien environment for them because it's unusual. It's always dark. They have to do science. They have a lot of tasks. And it's very similar to a journey to Mars or the International Space Station.BG: In principle. FS: Yes.BG: I want to go back to one of the pictures that was in your slide show, and it's just representative of the other photos \u2014Weren't those photos amazing? Yeah?Audience: Yeah!(Applause)FS: I have to thank the photographers from the team La Venta, because all of those photos are from the photographers.BG: You bring, actually, photographers with you in the expedition. They're professionals, they're speleologists and photographers. But when I look at these pictures, I wonder: there is zero light down there, and yet they look incredibly well-exposed. How do you take these pictures? How do your colleagues, the photographers, take these pictures?FS: Yeah. They are working in a darkroom, basically, so you can open the shutter of the camera and use the lights to paint the environment.BG: So you're basically \u2014FS: Yes. You can even keep the shutter open for one minute and then paint the environment. The final result is what you want to achieve.BG: You spray the environment with light and that's what you get. Maybe we can try this at home someday, I don't know.(Laughter)BG: Francesco, grazie. FS: Grazie.(Applause)", "id": 2359, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:12.823 --> 00:00:14.545\nI would like to invite you\n\n00:00:14.569 --> 00:00:16.275\nto come along on a visit\n\n00:00:16.299 --> 00:00:17.688\nto a dark continent.\n\n00:00:18.357 --> 00:00:19.971\nIt is the continent hidden\n\n00:00:19.995 --> 00:00:22.047\nunder the surface of the earth.\n\n00:00:22.071 --> 00:00:24.364\nIt is largely unexplored,\n\n00:00:24.388 --> 00:00:27.071\npoorly understood,\nand the stuff of legends.\n\n00:00:27.095 --> 00:00:29.933\nBut it is made also of dramatic landscapes\n\n00:00:29.957 --> 00:00:32.452\nlike this huge underground chamber,\n\n00:00:32.476 --> 00:00:37.317\nand it is rich with surprising\nbiological and mineralogical worlds.\n\n00:00:38.107 --> 00:00:42.933\nThanks to the efforts of intrepid voyagers\nin the last three centuries --\n\n00:00:42.957 --> 00:00:46.791\nactually, we know also thanks\nto satellite technology, of course --\n\n00:00:46.815 --> 00:00:51.019\nwe know almost every single square meter\nof our planet's surface.\n\n00:00:51.043 --> 00:00:55.984\nHowever, we know still very little\nabout what is hidden inside the earth.\n\n00:00:56.008 --> 00:01:01.933\nBecause a cave landscape,\nlike this deep shaft in Italy, is hidden,\n\n00:01:01.957 --> 00:01:05.311\nthe potential of cave exploration --\nthe geographical dimension --\n\n00:01:05.335 --> 00:01:07.703\nis poorly understood and unappreciated.\n\n00:01:07.727 --> 00:01:10.762\nBecause we are creatures\nliving on the surface,\n\n00:01:10.786 --> 00:01:14.933\nour perception of the inner\nside of the planet\n\n00:01:14.957 --> 00:01:16.921\nis in some ways skewed,\n\n00:01:16.945 --> 00:01:19.397\nas is that of the depth of the oceans\n\n00:01:19.421 --> 00:01:21.928\nor of the upper atmosphere.\n\n00:01:23.052 --> 00:01:30.010\nHowever, since systematic cave exploration\nstarted about one century ago,\n\n00:01:30.034 --> 00:01:34.405\nwe know actually that caves exist\nin every continent of the world.\n\n00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:38.473\nA single cave system,\nlike Mammoth Cave, which is in Kentucky,\n\n00:01:38.497 --> 00:01:42.481\ncan be as long\nas more than 600 kilometers.\n\n00:01:43.228 --> 00:01:47.335\nAnd an abyss like Krubera Voronya,\nwhich is in the Caucasus region,\n\n00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:50.137\nactually the deepest cave\nexplored in the world,\n\n00:01:50.161 --> 00:01:54.482\ncan go as far as more than 2,000\nmeters below the surface.\n\n00:01:54.506 --> 00:01:58.227\nThat means a journey of weeks\nfor a cave explorer.\n\n00:01:59.503 --> 00:02:02.729\nCaves form in karstic regions.\n\n00:02:02.753 --> 00:02:05.933\nSo karstic regions are areas of the world\n\n00:02:05.957 --> 00:02:09.447\nwhere the infiltrating water\nalong cracks, fractures,\n\n00:02:09.471 --> 00:02:13.431\ncan easily dissolve soluble lithologies,\n\n00:02:13.455 --> 00:02:16.235\nforming a drainage system\nof tunnels, conduits --\n\n00:02:16.259 --> 00:02:18.738\na three-dimensional network, actually.\n\n00:02:18.762 --> 00:02:24.641\nKarstic regions cover almost 20 percent\nof the continents' surface,\n\n00:02:24.665 --> 00:02:29.789\nand we know actually that speleologists\nin the last 50 years\n\n00:02:29.813 --> 00:02:35.477\nhave explored roughly 30,000 kilometers\nof cave passages around the world,\n\n00:02:35.501 --> 00:02:36.869\nwhich is a big number.\n\n00:02:36.893 --> 00:02:41.392\nBut geologists have estimated\nthat what is still missing,\n\n00:02:41.416 --> 00:02:43.646\nto be discovered and mapped,\n\n00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:47.221\nis something around 10 million kilometers.\n\n00:02:47.245 --> 00:02:50.535\nThat means that for each meter\nof a cave that we already know,\n\n00:02:50.559 --> 00:02:52.092\nthat we have explored,\n\n00:02:52.116 --> 00:02:57.510\nthere are still some tens of kilometers\nof undiscovered passages.\n\n00:02:57.534 --> 00:03:00.449\nThat means that this is really\nan endless continent,\n\n00:03:00.473 --> 00:03:03.971\nand we will never be able\nto explore it completely.\n\n00:03:04.555 --> 00:03:08.051\nAnd this estimation is made\nwithout considering other types of caves,\n\n00:03:08.075 --> 00:03:12.514\nlike, for example, inside glaciers\nor even volcanic caves,\n\n00:03:12.538 --> 00:03:16.070\nwhich are not karstic,\nbut are formed by lava flows.\n\n00:03:16.094 --> 00:03:21.750\nAnd if we have a look at other planets\nlike, for example, Mars,\n\n00:03:21.774 --> 00:03:23.624\nyou will see that this characteristic\n\n00:03:23.648 --> 00:03:26.735\nis not so specific of our home planet.\n\n00:03:27.581 --> 00:03:31.933\nHowever, I will show to you now\nthat we do not need to go to Mars\n\n00:03:31.957 --> 00:03:34.162\nto explore alien worlds.\n\n00:03:35.708 --> 00:03:39.648\nI'm a speleologist, that means\na cave explorer.\n\n00:03:39.672 --> 00:03:43.580\nAnd I started with this passion\nwhen I was really young\n\n00:03:43.604 --> 00:03:47.665\nin the mountains not far\nfrom my hometown in North Italy,\n\n00:03:47.689 --> 00:03:51.186\nin the karstic regions of the Alps\nand the Dolomites.\n\n00:03:51.210 --> 00:03:55.051\nBut soon, the quest for exploration\nbrought me to the farthest corner\n\n00:03:55.075 --> 00:03:57.804\nof the planet, searching\nfor new potential entrances\n\n00:03:57.828 --> 00:03:59.731\nof this undiscovered continent.\n\n00:04:00.536 --> 00:04:05.597\nAnd in 2009, I had the opportunity\nto visit the tepui table mountains,\n\n00:04:05.621 --> 00:04:08.617\nwhich are in the Orinoco\nand Amazon basins.\n\n00:04:08.641 --> 00:04:13.193\nThese massifs enchanted me\nfrom the first time I saw them.\n\n00:04:13.217 --> 00:04:16.584\nThey are surrounded by vertical,\nvertiginous rock walls\n\n00:04:16.608 --> 00:04:20.079\nwith silvery waterfalls\nthat are lost in the forest.\n\n00:04:20.103 --> 00:04:23.435\nThey really inspired in me\na sense of wilderness,\n\n00:04:23.459 --> 00:04:26.757\nwith a soul older than millions\nand millions of years.\n\n00:04:27.438 --> 00:04:31.349\nAnd this dramatic landscape\ninspired among other things\n\n00:04:31.373 --> 00:04:35.933\nalso Conan Doyle's\n\"The Lost World\" novel in 1912.\n\n00:04:35.957 --> 00:04:39.261\nAnd they are, really, a lost world.\n\n00:04:40.959 --> 00:04:46.244\nScientists consider those mountains\nas islands in time,\n\n00:04:46.268 --> 00:04:48.906\nbeing separated\nfrom the surrounding lowlands\n\n00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:51.614\nsince tens of millions of years ago.\n\n00:04:51.638 --> 00:04:55.539\nThey are surrounded\nby up to 1,000-meter-high walls,\n\n00:04:55.563 --> 00:04:58.695\nresembling a fortress,\nimpregnable by humans.\n\n00:04:58.719 --> 00:05:01.933\nAnd, in fact, only a few\nof these mountains have been climbed\n\n00:05:01.957 --> 00:05:03.793\nand explored on their top.\n\n00:05:04.698 --> 00:05:07.567\nThese mountains contain also\na scientific paradox:\n\n00:05:07.591 --> 00:05:09.651\nThey are made by quartz,\n\n00:05:09.675 --> 00:05:12.842\nwhich is a very common mineral\non the earth's crust,\n\n00:05:12.866 --> 00:05:17.244\nand the rock made up by quartz\nis called quartzite,\n\n00:05:17.268 --> 00:05:22.576\nand quartzite is one of the hardest\nand least soluble minerals on earth.\n\n00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:25.991\nSo we do not expect at all\nto find a cave there.\n\n00:05:26.015 --> 00:05:30.933\nDespite this, in the last 10 years,\nspeleologists from Italy,\n\n00:05:30.957 --> 00:05:34.762\nSlovakia, Czech Republic,\nand, of course, Venezuela and Brazil,\n\n00:05:34.786 --> 00:05:37.765\nhave explored several caves in this area.\n\n00:05:37.789 --> 00:05:40.276\nSo how can it be possible?\n\n00:05:40.300 --> 00:05:44.361\nTo understand this contradiction,\nwe have to consider the time factor,\n\n00:05:44.385 --> 00:05:47.688\nbecause the history of the tepuis\nis extremely long,\n\n00:05:47.712 --> 00:05:52.369\nstarting about 1.6 billion years ago\nwith the formation of the rock,\n\n00:05:52.393 --> 00:05:58.933\nand then evolving with the uplift\nof the region 150 million years ago,\n\n00:05:58.957 --> 00:06:01.933\nafter the disruption\nof the Pangaea supercontinent\n\n00:06:01.957 --> 00:06:04.310\nand the opening of the Atlantic Ocean.\n\n00:06:04.334 --> 00:06:10.644\nSo you can imagine that the water had tens\nor even hundreds of millions of years\n\n00:06:10.668 --> 00:06:14.726\nto sculpt the strangest forms\non the tepuis' surfaces,\n\n00:06:14.750 --> 00:06:20.764\nbut also to open the fractures\nand form stone cities, rock cities,\n\n00:06:20.788 --> 00:06:26.309\nfields of towers which are characterized\nin the famous landscape of the tepuis.\n\n00:06:26.333 --> 00:06:27.777\nBut nobody could have imagined\n\n00:06:27.801 --> 00:06:32.537\nwhat was happening inside a mountain\nin so long a time frame.\n\n00:06:32.561 --> 00:06:37.038\nAnd so I was focusing in 2010\non one of those massifs,\n\n00:06:37.062 --> 00:06:40.913\nthe Auy\u00e1n-tepui, which is very famous\nbecause it hosts Angel Falls,\n\n00:06:40.937 --> 00:06:43.526\nwhich is the highest\nwaterfall in the world --\n\n00:06:43.550 --> 00:06:47.609\nabout 979 meters of vertical drop.\n\n00:06:47.633 --> 00:06:52.519\nAnd I was searching for hints\nof the existence of cave systems\n\n00:06:52.543 --> 00:06:54.411\nthrough satellite images,\n\n00:06:54.435 --> 00:06:59.125\nand finally we identified an area\nof collapses of the surface --\n\n00:06:59.149 --> 00:07:01.395\nso, big boulders, rock piles --\n\n00:07:01.419 --> 00:07:04.730\nand that means that there\nwas a void below.\n\n00:07:04.754 --> 00:07:08.703\nIt was a clear indication that there\nwas something inside the mountain.\n\n00:07:08.727 --> 00:07:13.573\nSo we did several attempts\nto reach this area,\n\n00:07:13.597 --> 00:07:15.359\nby land and with a helicopter,\n\n00:07:15.383 --> 00:07:18.933\nbut it was really difficult\nbecause -- you have to imagine\n\n00:07:18.957 --> 00:07:23.336\nthat these mountains are covered\nby clouds most of the year, by fog.\n\n00:07:23.360 --> 00:07:24.733\nThere are strong winds,\n\n00:07:24.757 --> 00:07:29.339\nand there are almost 4,000 millimeters\nof rainfall per year,\n\n00:07:29.363 --> 00:07:32.625\nso it's really, really difficult\nto find good conditions.\n\n00:07:32.649 --> 00:07:37.432\nAnd only in 2013 we finally\nlanded on the spot\n\n00:07:37.456 --> 00:07:39.950\nand we started\nthe exploration of the cave.\n\n00:07:40.681 --> 00:07:42.598\nThe cave is huge.\n\n00:07:42.622 --> 00:07:46.449\nIt's a huge network under the surface\nof the tepui plateau,\n\n00:07:46.473 --> 00:07:50.167\nand in only ten days of expedition,\n\n00:07:50.191 --> 00:07:54.314\nwe explored more than 20 kilometers\nof cave passages.\n\n00:07:54.338 --> 00:07:59.735\nAnd it's a huge network\nof underground rivers,\n\n00:07:59.759 --> 00:08:04.933\nchannels, big rooms,\nextremely deep shafts.\n\n00:08:04.957 --> 00:08:07.981\nSo it's really an incredible place.\n\n00:08:08.005 --> 00:08:10.546\nAnd we named it Imawar\u00ec Yeuta.\n\n00:08:10.570 --> 00:08:16.831\nThat means, in the Pem\u00f3n indigenous\nlanguage, \"The House of the Gods.\"\n\n00:08:16.855 --> 00:08:20.637\nYou have to imagine that indigenous people\nhave never been there.\n\n00:08:20.661 --> 00:08:24.166\nIt was impossible for them\nto reach this area.\n\n00:08:24.190 --> 00:08:26.396\nHowever, there were legends\nabout the existence\n\n00:08:26.420 --> 00:08:28.447\nof a cave in the mountain.\n\n00:08:28.471 --> 00:08:30.241\nSo when we started the exploration,\n\n00:08:30.265 --> 00:08:32.495\nwe had to explore with a great respect,\n\n00:08:32.519 --> 00:08:36.080\nboth because of the religious beliefs\nof the indigenous people,\n\n00:08:36.104 --> 00:08:38.469\nbut also because\nit was really a sacred place,\n\n00:08:38.493 --> 00:08:41.828\nbecause no human had entered there before.\n\n00:08:41.852 --> 00:08:43.655\nSo we had to use special protocols\n\n00:08:43.679 --> 00:08:46.468\nto not contaminate the environment\nwith our presence,\n\n00:08:46.492 --> 00:08:48.667\nand we tried also to share\nwith the community,\n\n00:08:48.691 --> 00:08:51.364\nwith the indigenous community,\nour discoveries.\n\n00:08:51.388 --> 00:08:55.944\nAnd the caves represent, really,\na snapshot of the past.\n\n00:08:56.461 --> 00:08:59.173\nThe time needed for their formation\n\n00:08:59.197 --> 00:09:04.121\ncould be as long as 50 or even\n100 million years,\n\n00:09:04.145 --> 00:09:09.046\nwhich makes them possibly the oldest caves\nthat we can explore on earth.\n\n00:09:10.879 --> 00:09:16.606\nWhat you can find there\nis really evidence of a lost world.\n\n00:09:17.259 --> 00:09:19.246\nWhen you enter a quartzite cave,\n\n00:09:19.270 --> 00:09:22.718\nyou have to completely forget\nwhat you know about caves --\n\n00:09:22.742 --> 00:09:25.739\nclassic limestone caves\nor the touristic caves\n\n00:09:25.763 --> 00:09:28.120\nthat you can visit\nin several places in the world.\n\n00:09:28.144 --> 00:09:31.069\nBecause what seems\na simple stalactite here\n\n00:09:31.093 --> 00:09:36.178\nis not made by calcium carbonate,\nbut is made by opal,\n\n00:09:36.202 --> 00:09:41.786\nand one of those stalactites can require\ntens of millions of years to be formed.\n\n00:09:42.643 --> 00:09:46.720\nBut you can find even stranger forms,\nlike these mushrooms of silica\n\n00:09:46.744 --> 00:09:48.818\ngrowing on a boulder.\n\n00:09:48.842 --> 00:09:52.628\nAnd you can imagine our talks\nwhen we were exploring the cave.\n\n00:09:52.652 --> 00:09:57.645\nWe were the first entering\nand discovering those unknown things,\n\n00:09:57.669 --> 00:10:00.507\nthings like those monster eggs.\n\n00:10:00.531 --> 00:10:04.927\nAnd we were a bit scared\nbecause it was all a discovery,\n\n00:10:04.951 --> 00:10:07.034\nand we didn't want to find a dinosaur.\n\n00:10:07.058 --> 00:10:08.562\nWe didn't find a dinosaur.\n\n00:10:08.586 --> 00:10:10.183\n(Laughter)\n\n00:10:10.207 --> 00:10:13.504\nAnyway, actually, we know\nthat this kind of formation,\n\n00:10:13.528 --> 00:10:16.061\nafter several studies,\n\n00:10:16.085 --> 00:10:19.310\nwe know that these kinds of formations\nare living organisms.\n\n00:10:19.334 --> 00:10:24.768\nThey are bacterial colonies using silica\nto build mineral structures\n\n00:10:24.792 --> 00:10:26.722\nresembling stromatolites.\n\n00:10:26.746 --> 00:10:31.267\nStromatolites are some of the oldest\nforms of life that we can find on earth.\n\n00:10:31.291 --> 00:10:33.094\nAnd here in the tepuis,\n\n00:10:33.118 --> 00:10:37.801\nthe interesting thing is that these\nbacteria colonies have evolved\n\n00:10:37.825 --> 00:10:42.054\nin complete isolation\nfrom the external surface,\n\n00:10:42.078 --> 00:10:44.702\nand without being in contact with humans.\n\n00:10:44.726 --> 00:10:47.323\nThey have never been\nin contact with humans.\n\n00:10:47.347 --> 00:10:50.414\nSo the implications\nfor science are enormous,\n\n00:10:50.438 --> 00:10:54.440\nbecause here you could find,\nfor example, microbes\n\n00:10:54.464 --> 00:10:59.416\nthat could be useful to resolve\ndiseases in medicine,\n\n00:10:59.440 --> 00:11:03.376\nor you could find even a new kind\nof material with unknown properties.\n\n00:11:03.400 --> 00:11:07.459\nAnd, in fact, we discovered in the cave\na new mineral structure for science,\n\n00:11:07.483 --> 00:11:10.490\nwhich is rossiantonite,\na phosphate-sulfate.\n\n00:11:11.564 --> 00:11:16.278\nSo whatever you find in the cave,\neven a small cricket,\n\n00:11:16.302 --> 00:11:20.270\nhas evolved in the dark\nin complete isolation.\n\n00:11:20.294 --> 00:11:24.547\nAnd, really, everything that you can feel\nin the cave are real connections\n\n00:11:24.571 --> 00:11:27.611\nbetween the biological\nand the mineralogical world.\n\n00:11:28.502 --> 00:11:34.318\nSo as we explore this dark continent\n\n00:11:34.342 --> 00:11:40.746\nand discover its mineralogical\nand biological diversity and uniqueness,\n\n00:11:40.770 --> 00:11:45.139\nwe will find probably clues\nabout the origin of life on our planet\n\n00:11:45.163 --> 00:11:48.140\nand on the relationship\nand evolution of life\n\n00:11:48.164 --> 00:11:51.150\nin relationship with the mineral world.\n\n00:11:51.174 --> 00:11:55.116\nWhat seems only a dark, empty environment\n\n00:11:55.140 --> 00:11:57.933\ncould be in reality a chest of wonders\n\n00:11:57.957 --> 00:12:00.437\nfull of useful information.\n\n00:12:02.060 --> 00:12:05.933\nWith a team of Italian, Venezuelan\nand Brazilian speleologists,\n\n00:12:05.957 --> 00:12:09.148\nwhich is called La Venta Teraphosa,\n\n00:12:09.172 --> 00:12:11.240\nwe will be back soon to Latin America,\n\n00:12:11.264 --> 00:12:16.712\nbecause we want to explore other tepuis\nin the farthest areas of the Amazon.\n\n00:12:16.736 --> 00:12:19.756\nThere are still very unknown mountains,\n\n00:12:19.780 --> 00:12:24.474\nlike Marahuaca, which is almost\n3,000 meters high above sea level,\n\n00:12:24.498 --> 00:12:28.597\nor Arac\u00e0, which is in the upper region\nof Rio Negro in Brazil.\n\n00:12:28.621 --> 00:12:33.540\nAnd we suppose that we could find there\neven bigger cave systems,\n\n00:12:33.564 --> 00:12:38.252\nand each one with its own\nundiscovered world.\n\n00:12:38.594 --> 00:12:39.768\nThank you.\n\n00:12:39.792 --> 00:12:45.246\n(Applause)\n\n00:12:45.270 --> 00:12:49.007\nBruno Giussani: Thank you, Francesco.\nGive me that to start so we don't forget.\n\n00:12:49.031 --> 00:12:52.869\nFrancesco, you said we don't need\nto go to Mars to find alien life,\n\n00:12:52.893 --> 00:12:55.818\nand indeed, last time we spoke,\nyou were in Sardinia\n\n00:12:55.842 --> 00:12:58.085\nand you were training European astronauts.\n\n00:12:58.109 --> 00:13:01.583\nSo what do you, a speleologist,\ntell and teach to the astronauts?\n\n00:13:01.607 --> 00:13:04.390\nFrancesco Sauro: Yeah, we are --\nit's a program of training\n\n00:13:04.414 --> 00:13:09.315\nfor not only European, but also NASA,\nRoskosmos, JAXA astronauts, in a cave.\n\n00:13:09.339 --> 00:13:12.867\nSo they stay in a cave\nfor about one week in isolation.\n\n00:13:12.891 --> 00:13:16.771\nThey have to work together\nin a real, real dangerous environment,\n\n00:13:16.795 --> 00:13:20.605\nand it's a real alien environment for them\nbecause it's unusual.\n\n00:13:20.629 --> 00:13:24.933\nIt's always dark. They have to do science.\nThey have a lot of tasks.\n\n00:13:24.957 --> 00:13:27.489\nAnd it's very similar to a journey to Mars\n\n00:13:27.513 --> 00:13:29.185\nor the International Space Station.\n\n00:13:29.209 --> 00:13:30.468\nBG: In principle.\nFS: Yes.\n\n00:13:30.492 --> 00:13:32.569\nBG: I want to go back\nto one of the pictures\n\n00:13:32.593 --> 00:13:34.426\nthat was in your slide show,\n\n00:13:34.450 --> 00:13:36.839\nand it's just representative\nof the other photos --\n\n00:13:36.863 --> 00:13:39.161\nWeren't those photos amazing?

How we can fix them", "duration": "1015", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/hilary_cottam_social_services_are_broken_how_we_can_fix_them", "transcript": "I want to tell you three stories about the power of relationships to solve the deep and complex social problems of this century.You know, sometimes it seems like all these problems of poverty, inequality, ill health, unemployment, violence, addiction \u2014 they're right there in one person's life. So I want to tell you about someone like this that I know. I'm going to call her Ella. Ella lives in a British city on a run down estate. The shops are closed, the pub's gone, the playground's pretty desolate and never used, and inside Ella's house, the tension is palpable and the noise levels are deafening. The TV's on at full volume. One of her sons is fighting with one of her daughters. Another son, Ryan, is keeping up this constant stream of abuse from the kitchen, and the dogs are locked behind the bedroom door and straining. Ella is stuck. She has lived with crisis for 40 years. She knows nothing else, and she knows no way out. She's had a whole series of abusive partners, and, tragically, one of her children has been taken into care by social services. The three children that still live with her suffer from a whole range of problems, and none of them are in education. And Ella says to me that she is repeating the cycle of her own mother's life before her.But when I met Ella, there were 73 different services on offer for her and her family in the city where she lives, 73 different services run out of 24 departments in one city, and Ella and her partners and her children were known to most of them. They think nothing of calling social services to try and mediate one of the many arguments that broke out. And the family home was visited on a regular basis by social workers, youth workers, a health officer, a housing officer, a home tutor and the local policemen. And the governments say that there are 100,000 families in Britain today like Ella's, struggling to break the cycle of economic, social and environmental deprivation. And they also say that managing this problem costs a quarter of a million pounds per family per year and yet nothing changes. None of these well-meaning visitors are making a difference.This is a chart we made in the same city with another family like Ella's. This shows 30 years of intervention in that family's life. And just as with Ella, not one of these interventions is part of an overall plan. There's no end goal in sight. None of the interventions are dealing with the underlying issues. These are just containment measures, ways of managing a problem. One of the policemen says to me, \"Look, I just deliver the message and then I leave.\"So, I've spent time living with families like Ella's in different parts of the world, because I want to know: what can we learn from places where our social institutions just aren't working? I want to know what it feels like to live in Ella's family. I want to know what's going on and what we can do differently.Well, the first thing I learned is that cost is a really slippery concept. Because when the government says that a family like Ella's costs a quarter of a million pounds a year to manage, what it really means is that this system costs a quarter of a million pounds a year. Because not one penny of this money actually touches Ella's family in a way that makes a difference. Instead, the system is just like this costly gyroscope that spins around the families, keeping them stuck at its heart, exactly where they are.And I also spent time with the frontline workers, and I learned that it is an impossible situation. So Tom, who is the social worker for Ella's 14-year-old son Ryan, has to spend 86 percent of his time servicing the system: meetings with colleagues, filling out forms, more meetings with colleagues to discuss the forms, and maybe most shockingly, the 14 percent of the time he has to be with Ryan is spent getting data and information for the system. So he says to Ryan, \"How often have you been smoking? Have you been drinking? When did you go to school?\" And this kind of interaction rules out the possibility of a normal conversation. It rules out the possibility of what's needed to build a relationship between Tom and Ryan.When we made this chart, the frontline workers, the professionals \u2014 they stared at it absolutely amazed. It snaked around the walls of their offices. So many hours, so well meant, but ultimately so futile. And there was this moment of absolute breakdown, and then of clarity: we had to work in a different way.So in a really brave step, the leaders of the city where Ella lives agreed that we could start by reversing Ryan's ratio. So everyone who came into contact with Ella or a family like Ella's would spend 80 percent of their time working with the families and only 20 percent servicing the system. And even more radically, the families would lead and they would decide who was in a best position to help them. So Ella and another mother were asked to be part of an interview panel, to choose from amongst the existing professionals who would work with them. And many, many people wanted to join us, because you don't go into this kind of work to manage a system, you go in because you can and you want to make a difference.So Ella and the mother asked everybody who came through the door, \"What will you do when my son starts kicking me?\" And so the first person who comes in says, \"Well, I'll look around for the nearest exit and I will back out very slowly, and if the noise is still going on, I'll call my supervisor.\" And the mothers go, \"You're the system. Get out of here!\" And then the next person who comes is a policeman, and he says, \"Well, I'll tackle your son to the ground and then I'm not sure what I'll do.\" And the mothers say, \"Thank you.\" So, they chose professionals who confessed they didn't necessarily have the answers, who said \u2014 well, they weren't going to talk in jargon. They showed their human qualities and convinced the mothers that they would stick with them through thick and thin, even though they wouldn't be soft with them.So these new teams and the families were then given a sliver of the former budget, but they could spend the money in any way they chose. And so one of the families went out for supper. They went to McDonald's and they sat down and they talked and they listened for the first time in a long time. Another family asked the team if they would help them do up their home. And one mother took the money and she used it as a float to start a social enterprise.And in a really short space of time, something new started to grow: a relationship between the team and the workers. And then some remarkable changes took place. Maybe it's not surprising that the journey for Ella has had some big steps backwards as well as forwards. But today, she's completed an IT training course, she has her first paid job, her children are back in school, and the neighbors, who previously just hoped this family would be moved anywhere except next door to them, are fine. They've made some new friendships. And all the same people have been involved in this transformation \u2014 same families, same workers. But the relationship between them has been supported to change.So I'm telling you about Ella because I think that relationships are the critical resource we have in solving some of these intractable problems. But today, our relationships are all but written off by our politics, our social policies, our welfare institutions. And I've learned that this really has to change.So what do I mean by relationships? I'm talking about the simple human bonds between us, a kind of authentic sense of connection, of belonging, the bonds that make us happy, that support us to change, to be brave like Ella and try something new. And, you know, it's no accident that those who run and work in the institutions that are supposed to support Ella and her family don't talk about relationships, because relationships are expressly designed out of a welfare model that was drawn up in Britain and exported around the world. The contemporaries of William Beveridge, who was the architect of the first welfare state and the author of the Beveridge Report, had little faith in what they called the average sensual or emotional man. Instead, they trusted this idea of the impersonal system and the bureaucrat who would be detached and work in this system. And the impact of Beveridge on the way the modern state sees social issues just can't be underestimated. The Beveridge Report sold over 100,000 copies in the first weeks of publication alone. People queued in the rain on a November night to get hold of a copy, and it was read across the country, across the colonies, across Europe, across the United States of America, and it had this huge impact on the way that welfare states were designed around the globe. The cultures, the bureaucracies, the institutions \u2014 they are global, and they've come to seem like common sense. They've become so ingrained in us, that actually we don't even see them anymore. And I think it's really important to say that in the 20th century, they were remarkably successful, these institutions. They led to longer lifespans, the eradication of mass disease, mass housing, almost universal education. But at the same time, Beveridge sowed the seeds of today's challenges.So let me tell you a second story. What do you think today is a bigger killer than a lifetime of smoking? It's loneliness. According to government statistics, one person over 60 \u2014 one in three \u2014 doesn't speak to or see another person in a week. One person in 10, that's 850,000 people, doesn't speak to anyone else in a month. And we're not the only people with this problem; this problem touches the whole of the Western world. And it's even more acute in countries like China, where a process of rapid urbanization, mass migration, has left older people alone in the villages. And so the services that Beveridge designed and exported \u2014 they can't address this kind of problem. Loneliness is like a collective relational challenge, and it can't be addressed by a traditional bureaucratic response.So some years ago, wanting to understand this problem, I started to work with a group of about 60 older people in South London, where I live. I went shopping, I played bingo, but mainly I was just observing and listening. I wanted to know what we could do differently. And if you ask them, people tell you they want two things. They want somebody to go up a ladder and change a light bulb, or to be there when they come out of hospital. They want on-demand, practical support. And they want to have fun. They want to go out, do interesting things with like-minded people, and make friends like we've all made friends at every stage of our lives. So we rented a phone line, hired a couple of handymen, and started a service we called \"Circle.\" And Circle offers its local membership a toll-free 0 800 number that they can call on demand for any support. And people have called us for so many reasons. They've called because their pets are unwell, their DVD is broken, they've forgotten how to use their mobile phone, or maybe they are coming out of hospital and they want someone to be there. And Circle also offers a rich social calendar \u2014 knitting, darts, museum tours, hot air ballooning \u2014 you name it. But here's the interesting thing, the really deep change: over time, the friendships that have formed have begun to replace the practical offer.So let me tell you about Belinda. Belinda's a Circle member, and she was going into hospital for a hip operation, so she called her local Circle to say they wouldn't see her for a bit. And Damon, who runs the local Circle, calls her back and says, \"How can I help?\" And Belinda says, \"Oh no, I'm fine \u2014 Jocelyn is doing the shopping, Tony's doing the gardening, Melissa and Joe are going to come in and cook and chat.\" So five Circle members had organized themselves to take care of Belinda. And Belinda's 80, although she says that she feels 25 inside, but she also says that she felt stuck and pretty down when she joined Circle. But the simple act of encouraging her to come along to that first event led to a process where natural friendships formed, friendships that today are replacing the need for expensive services. It's relationships that are making the difference.So I think that three factors have converged that enable us to put relationships at the heart and center of how we solve social problems today. Firstly, the nature of the problems \u2014 they've changed, and they require different solutions. Secondly, the cost, human as much as financial, of doing business as usual. And thirdly, technology.I've talked about the first two factors. It's technology that enables these approaches to scale and potentially now support thousands of people. So the technology we've used is really simple, it's made up of available things like databases, mobile phones. Circle has got this very simple system that underpins it, enables a small local team to support a membership of up to a thousand. And you can contrast this with a neighborhood organization of the 1970s, when this kind of scale just wasn't possible, neither was the quality or the longevity that the spine of technology can provide.So it's relationships underpinned by technology that can turn the Beveridge models on their heads. The Beveridge models are all about institutions with finite resources, anonymously managing access. In my work at the front line, I've seen again and again how up to 80 percent of resource is spent keeping people out. So professionals have to administer these increasingly complex forms of administration that are basically about stopping people accessing the service or managing the queue. And Circle, like the relational services that we and others have designed, inverts this logic. What it says is, the more people, the more relationships, the stronger the solution. So I want to tell you my third and final story, which is about unemployment. In Britain, as in most places in the world, our welfare states were primarily designed to get people into work, to educate them for this, and to keep them healthy. But here, too, the systems are failing. And so the response has been to try and make these old systems even more efficient and transactional \u2014 to speed up processing times, divide people into ever-smaller categories, try and target services at them more efficiently \u2014 in other words, the very opposite of relational.But guess how most people find work today? Through word of mouth. It turns out that in Britain today, most new jobs are not advertised. So it's friends that tell you about a job, it's friends that recommend you for a job, and it's a rich and diverse social network that helps you find work. Maybe some of you here this evening are thinking, \"But I found my job through an advert,\" but if you think back, it was probably a friend that showed you the ad and then encouraged you to apply. But not surprisingly, people who perhaps most need this rich and diverse network are those who are most isolated from it.So knowing this, and also knowing about the costs and failure of current systems, we designed something new with relationships at its heart. We designed a service that encourages people to meet up, people in and out of work, to work together in structured ways and try new opportunities. And, well, it's very hard to compare the results of these new systems with the old transactional models, but it looks like, with our first 1,000 members, we outperformed existing services by a factor of three, at a fraction of the cost. And here, too, we've used technology, but not to network people in the way that a social platform would do. We've used it to bring people face to face and connect them with each other, building real relationships and supporting people to find work.At the end of his life, in 1948, Beveridge wrote a third report. And in it he said he had made a dreadful mistake. He had left people and their communities out. And this omission, he said, led to seeing people, and people starting to see themselves, within the categories of the bureaucracies and the institutions. And human relationships were already withering. But unfortunately, this third report was much less read than Beveridge's earlier work.But today, we need to bring people and their communities back into the heart of the way we design new systems and new services, in an approach that I call \"Relational Welfare.\" We need to leave behind these old, transactional, unsuitable, outdated models, and we need to adopt instead the shared collective relational responses that can support a family like Ella's, that can address an issue like loneliness, that can support people into work and up the skills curve in a modern labor market, that can also address challenges of education, of health care systems, and so many more of those problems that are pressing on our societies. It is all about relationships. Relationships are the critical resource we have.Thank you.(Applause)", "id": 2364, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:15.207\nI want to

nothing else,\nand she knows no way out.\n\n00:01:11.035 --> 00:01:13.684\nShe's had a whole series\nof abusive partners,\n\n00:01:13.708 --> 00:01:18.025\nand, tragically, one of her children has\nbeen taken into care by social services.\n\n00:01:18.049 --> 00:01:20.321\nThe three children\nthat still live with her\n\n00:01:20.345 --> 00:01:23.820\nsuffer from a whole range of problems,\nand none of them are in education.\n\n00:01:23.844 --> 00:01:26.841\nAnd Ella says to me that she\nis repeating the cycle\n\n00:01:26.865 --> 00:01:29.629\nof her own mother's life before her.\n\n00:01:29.653 --> 00:01:32.933\nBut when I met Ella,\nthere were 73 different services\n\n00:01:32.957 --> 00:01:36.095\non offer for her and her family\nin the city where she lives,\n\n00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:40.388\n73 different services\nrun out of 24 departments in one city,\n\n00:01:40.412 --> 00:01:43.722\nand Ella and her partners and her children\nwere known to most of them.\n\n00:01:43.746 --> 00:01:45.860\nThey think nothing of calling\nsocial services\n\n00:01:45.884 --> 00:01:48.736\nto try and mediate one of the many\narguments that broke out.\n\n00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:52.209\nAnd the family home was visited\non a regular basis by social workers,\n\n00:01:52.233 --> 00:01:56.933\nyouth workers, a health officer,\na housing officer, a home tutor\n\n00:01:56.957 --> 00:01:58.933\nand the local policemen.\n\n00:01:58.957 --> 00:02:01.695\nAnd the governments say\nthat there are 100,000 families\n\n00:02:01.719 --> 00:02:03.818\nin Britain today like Ella's,\n\n00:02:03.842 --> 00:02:09.203\nstruggling to break the cycle of economic,\nsocial and environmental deprivation.\n\n00:02:09.227 --> 00:02:11.401\nAnd they also say\nthat managing this problem\n\n00:02:11.425 --> 00:02:14.427\ncosts a quarter of a million pounds\nper family per year\n\n00:02:14.451 --> 00:02:15.823\nand yet nothing changes.\n\n00:02:15.847 --> 00:02:18.933\nNone of these well-meaning visitors\nare making a difference.\n\n00:02:18.957 --> 00:02:23.240\nThis is a chart we made in the same city\nwith another family like Ella's.\n\n00:02:23.264 --> 00:02:26.866\nThis shows 30 years of intervention\nin that family's life.\n\n00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:30.721\nAnd just as with Ella, not one of these\ninterventions is part of an overall plan.\n\n00:02:30.745 --> 00:02:32.192\nThere's no end goal in sight.\n\n00:02:32.216 --> 00:02:35.267\nNone of the interventions\nare dealing with the underlying issues.\n\n00:02:35.291 --> 00:02:38.301\nThese are just containment measures,\nways of managing a problem.\n\n00:02:38.325 --> 00:02:40.044\nOne of the policemen says to me,\n\n00:02:40.068 --> 00:02:42.557\n\"Look, I just deliver the message\nand then I leave.\"\n\n00:02:42.581 --> 00:02:45.266\nSo, I've spent time living\nwith families like Ella's\n\n00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:46.830\nin different parts of the world,\n\n00:02:46.854 --> 00:02:49.092\nbecause I want to know: what can we learn\n\n00:02:49.116 --> 00:02:52.609\nfrom places where our social institutions\njust aren't working?\n\n00:02:52.633 --> 00:02:55.424\nI want to know what it feels like\nto live in Ella's family.\n\n00:02:55.448 --> 00:02:59.459\nI want to know what's going on\nand what we can do differently.\n\n00:02:59.483 --> 00:03:03.572\nWell, the first thing I learned\nis that cost is a really slippery concept.\n\n00:03:03.596 --> 00:03:06.314\nBecause when the government says\nthat a family like Ella's\n\n00:03:06.338 --> 00:03:08.935\ncosts a quarter of a million pounds\na year to manage,\n\n00:03:08.959 --> 00:03:10.110\nwhat it really means\n\n00:03:10.134 --> 00:03:13.104\nis that this system costs\na quarter of a million pounds a year.\n\n00:03:13.128 --> 00:03:16.243\nBecause not one penny of this money\nactually touches Ella's family\n\n00:03:16.267 --> 00:03:17.847\nin a way that makes a difference.\n\n00:03:17.871 --> 00:03:20.414\nInstead, the system is just\nlike this costly gyroscope\n\n00:03:20.438 --> 00:03:23.417\nthat spins around the families,\nkeeping them stuck at its heart,\n\n00:03:23.441 --> 00:03:25.466\nexactly where they are.\n\n00:03:25.490 --> 00:03:27.813\nAnd I also spent time\nwith the frontline workers,\n\n00:03:27.837 --> 00:03:30.660\nand I learned that it\nis an impossible situation.\n\n00:03:30.684 --> 00:03:35.399\nSo Tom, who is the social worker\nfor Ella's 14-year-old son Ryan,\n\n00:03:35.423 --> 00:03:38.933\nhas to spend 86 percent of his time\nservicing the system:\n\n00:03:38.957 --> 00:03:41.028\nmeetings with colleagues,\nfilling out forms,\n\n00:03:41.052 --> 00:03:43.480\nmore meetings with colleagues\nto discuss the forms,\n\n00:03:43.504 --> 00:03:44.750\nand maybe most shockingly,\n\n00:03:44.774 --> 00:03:47.343\nthe 14 percent of the time\nhe has to be with Ryan\n\n00:03:47.367 --> 00:03:49.863\nis spent getting data\nand information for the system.\n\n00:03:49.887 --> 00:03:51.038\nSo he says to Ryan,\n\n00:03:51.062 --> 00:03:53.749\n\"How often have you been smoking?\nHave you been drinking?\n\n00:03:53.773 --> 00:03:55.086\nWhen did you go to school?\"\n\n00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:57.660\nAnd this kind of interaction\nrules out the possibility\n\n00:03:57.684 --> 00:03:58.896\nof a normal conversation.\n\n00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:01.038\nIt rules out the possibility\nof what's needed\n\n00:04:01.062 --> 00:04:04.039\nto build a relationship\nbetween Tom and Ryan.\n\n00:04:04.957 --> 00:04:06.346\nWhen we made this chart,\n\n00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:08.385\nthe frontline workers,\nthe professionals --\n\n00:04:08.409 --> 00:04:10.180\nthey stared at it absolutely amazed.\n\n00:04:10.204 --> 00:04:12.933\nIt snaked around the walls\nof their offices.\n\n00:04:12.957 --> 00:04:18.933\nSo many hours, so well meant,\nbut ultimately so futile.\n\n00:04:18.957 --> 00:04:22.397\nAnd there was this moment\nof absolute breakdown,\n\n00:04:22.421 --> 00:04:24.253\nand then of clarity:\n\n00:04:24.277 --> 00:04:26.890\nwe had to work in a different way.\n\n00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:30.915\nSo in a really brave step,\nthe leaders of the city where Ella lives\n\n00:04:30.939 --> 00:04:33.584\nagreed that we could start\nby reversing Ryan's ratio.\n\n00:04:33.608 --> 00:04:36.768\nSo everyone who came into contact\nwith Ella or a family like Ella's\n\n00:04:36.792 --> 00:04:39.704\nwould spend 80 percent of their time\nworking with the families\n\n00:04:39.728 --> 00:04:42.293\nand only 20 percent servicing the system.\n\n00:04:42.317 --> 00:04:44.168\nAnd even more radically,\n\n00:04:44.192 --> 00:04:45.362\nthe families would lead\n\n00:04:45.386 --> 00:04:48.713\nand they would decide who\nwas in a best position to help them.\n\n00:04:48.737 --> 00:04:52.096\nSo Ella and another mother were asked\nto be part of an interview panel,\n\n00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:54.443\nto choose from amongst\nthe existing professionals\n\n00:04:54.467 --> 00:04:56.734\nwho would work with them.\n\n00:04:56.758 --> 00:04:58.724\nAnd many, many people wanted to join us,\n\n00:04:58.748 --> 00:05:01.819\nbecause you don't go into this kind\nof work to manage a system,\n\n00:05:01.843 --> 00:05:04.696\nyou go in because you can\nand you want to make a difference.\n\n00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:07.933\nSo Ella and the mother asked\neverybody who came through the door,\n\n00:05:07.957 --> 00:05:10.389\n\"What will you do when my son\nstarts kicking me?\"\n\n00:05:10.413 --> 00:05:12.933\nAnd so the first person who comes in says,\n\n00:05:12.957 --> 00:05:15.076\n\"Well, I'll look around\nfor the nearest exit\n\n00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:17.933\nand I will back out very slowly,\n\n00:05:17.957 --> 00:05:20.958\nand if the noise is still going on,\nI'll call my supervisor.\"\n\n00:05:20.982 --> 00:05:23.695\nAnd the mothers go,\n\"You're the system. Get out of here!\"\n\n00:05:23.719 --> 00:05:26.933\nAnd then the next person who comes\nis a policeman, and he says,\n\n00:05:26.957 --> 00:05:30.933\n\"Well, I'll tackle your son to the ground\nand then I'm not sure what I'll do.\"\n\n00:05:30.957 --> 00:05:32.635\nAnd the mothers say, \"Thank you.\"\n\n00:05:32.659 --> 00:05:34.881\nSo, they chose professionals who confessed\n\n00:05:34.905 --> 00:05:36.875\nthey didn't necessarily have the answers,\n\n00:05:36.899 --> 00:05:40.488\nwho said -- well, they weren't\ngoing to talk in jargon.\n\n00:05:40.512 --> 00:05:43.401\nThey showed their human qualities\nand convinced the mothers\n\n00:05:43.425 --> 00:05:46.038\nthat they would stick with them\nthrough thick and thin,\n\n00:05:46.062 --> 00:05:48.121\neven though they wouldn't\nbe soft with them.\n\n00:05:48.145 --> 00:05:49.837\nSo these new teams and the families\n\n00:05:49.861 --> 00:05:52.020\nwere then given a sliver\nof the former budget,\n\n00:05:52.044 --> 00:05:54.535\nbut they could spend the money\nin any way they chose.\n\n00:05:54.559 --> 00:05:56.794\nAnd so one of the families\nwent out for supper.\n\n00:05:56.818 --> 00:06:00.423\nThey went to McDonald's and they sat down\nand they talked and they listened\n\n00:06:00.447 --> 00:06:02.507\nfor the first time in a long time.\n\n00:06:02.531 --> 00:06:04.121\nAnother family asked the team\n\n00:06:04.145 --> 00:06:07.187\nif they would help them do up their home.\n\n00:06:07.211 --> 00:06:08.718\nAnd one mother took the money\n\n00:06:08.742 --> 00:06:12.269\nand she used it as a float\nto start a social enterprise.\n\n00:06:12.293 --> 00:06:14.742\nAnd in a really short space of time,\n\n00:06:14.766 --> 00:06:17.175\nsomething new started to grow:\n\n00:06:17.199 --> 00:06:20.097\na relationship between the team\nand the workers.\n\n00:06:20.121 --> 00:06:23.038\nAnd then some remarkable\nchanges took place.\n\n00:06:23.062 --> 00:06:24.582\nMaybe it's not surprising\n\n00:06:24.606 --> 00:06:27.340\nthat the journey for Ella has had\nsome big steps backwards\n\n00:06:27.364 --> 00:06:28.525\nas well as forwards.\n\n00:06:28.549 --> 00:06:31.314\nBut today, she's completed\nan IT training course,\n\n00:06:31.338 --> 00:06:34.626\nshe has her first paid job,\nher children are back in school,\n\n00:06:34.650 --> 00:06:35.801\nand the neighbors,\n\n00:06:35.825 --> 00:06:38.734\nwho previously just hoped this family\nwould be moved anywhere\n\n00:06:38.758 --> 00:06:39.964\nexcept next door to them,\n\n00:06:39.988 --> 00:06:41.139\nare fine.\n\n00:06:41.163 --> 00:06:43.263\nThey've made some new friendships.\n\n00:06:43.287 --> 00:06:47.303\nAnd all the same people have been\ninvolved in this transformation --\n\n00:06:47.327 --> 00:06:49.933\nsame families, same workers.\n\n00:06:49.957 --> 00:06:53.864\nBut the relationship between them\nhas been supported to change.\n\n00:06:54.514 --> 00:06:57.595\nSo I'm telling you about Ella\nbecause I think that relationships\n\n00:06:57.619 --> 00:06:59.556\nare the critical resource we have\n\n00:06:59.580 --> 00:07:01.958\nin solving some of these\nintractable problems.\n\n00:07:01.982 --> 00:07:04.704\nBut today, our relationships\nare all but written off\n\n00:07:04.728 --> 00:07:08.596\nby our politics, our social policies,\nour welfare institutions.\n\n00:07:08.620 --> 00:07:11.296\nAnd I've learned that this\nreally has to change.\n\n00:07:11.960 --> 00:07:13.910\nSo what do I mean by relationships?\n\n00:07:14.369 --> 00:07:17.373\nI'm talking about the simple\nhuman bonds between us,\n\n00:07:17.397 --> 00:07:19.933\na kind of authentic sense\nof connection, of belonging,\n\n00:07:19.957 --> 00:07:22.641\nthe bonds that make us happy,\nthat support us to change,\n\n00:07:22.665 --> 00:07:25.469\nto be brave like Ella\nand try something new.\n\n00:07:25.493 --> 00:07:27.413\nAnd, you know, it's no accident\n\n00:07:27.437 --> 00:07:29.976\nthat those who run and work\nin the institutions\n\n00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:32.258\nthat are supposed to support\nElla and her family\n\n00:07:32.282 --> 00:07:33.796\ndon't talk about relationships,\n\n00:07:33.820 --> 00:07:37.892\nbecause relationships are expressly\ndesigned out of a welfare model\n\n00:07:37.916 --> 00:07:41.374\nthat was drawn up in Britain\nand exported around the world.\n\n00:07:41.398 --> 00:07:43.331\nThe contemporaries of William Beveridge,\n\n00:07:43.355 --> 00:07:45.613\nwho was the architect\nof the first welfare state\n\n00:07:45.637 --> 00:07:47.557\nand the author of the Beveridge Report,\n\n00:07:47.581 --> 00:07:51.080\nhad little faith in what they called\nthe average sensual or emotional man.\n\n00:07:51.104 --> 00:07:54.548\nInstead, they trusted this idea\nof the impersonal system\n\n00:07:54.572 --> 00:07:58.933\nand the bureaucrat who would be detached\nand work in this system.\n\n00:07:58.957 --> 00:08:01.072\nAnd the impact of Beveridge\n\n00:08:01.096 --> 00:08:03.339\non the way the modern state\nsees social issues\n\n00:08:03.363 --> 00:08:05.422\njust can't be underestimated.\n\n00:08:05.446 --> 00:08:08.622\nThe Beveridge Report\nsold over 100,000 copies\n\n00:08:08.646 --> 00:08:10.975\nin the first weeks of publication alone.\n\n00:08:10.999 --> 00:08:14.208\nPeople queued in the rain\non a November night to get hold of a copy,\n\n00:08:14.232 --> 00:08:17.598\nand it was read across the country,\nacross the colonies, across Europe,\n\n00:08:17.622 --> 00:08:19.363\nacross the United States of America,\n\n00:08:19.387 --> 00:08:21.159\nand it had this huge impact\n\n00:08:21.183 --> 00:08:24.780\non the way that welfare states\nwere designed around the globe.\n\n00:08:24.804 --> 00:08:29.865\nThe cultures, the bureaucracies,\nthe institutions -- they are global,\n\n00:08:29.889 --> 00:08:31.909\nand they've come to seem\nlike common sense.\n\n00:08:31.933 --> 00:08:34.017\nThey've become so ingrained in us,\n\n00:08:34.041 --> 00:08:36.288\nthat actually we don't even\nsee them anymore.\n\n00:08:36.814 --> 00:08:39.933\nAnd I think it's really important to say\nthat in the 20th century,\n\n00:08:39.957 --> 00:08:42.594\nthey were remarkably successful,\nthese institutions.\n\n00:08:42.618 --> 00:08:46.049\nThey led to longer lifespans,\nthe eradication of mass disease,\n\n00:08:46.073 --> 00:08:49.064\nmass housing, almost universal education.\n\n00:08:49.957 --> 00:08:51.933\nBut at the same time,\n\n00:08:51.957 --> 00:08:55.389\nBeveridge sowed the seeds\nof today's challenges.\n\n00:08:55.957 --> 00:08:57.721\nSo let me tell you a second story.\n\n00:08:57.745 --> 00:09:02.957\nWhat do you think today is a bigger killer\nthan a lifetime of smoking?\n\n00:09:05.184 --> 00:09:06.792\nIt's loneliness.\n\n00:09:07.699 --> 00:09:12.615\nAccording to government statistics,\none person over 60 -- one in three --\n\n00:09:12.639 --> 00:09:15.831\ndoesn't speak to or see\nanother person in a week.\n\n00:09:16.624 --> 00:09:19.933\nOne person in 10, that's 850,000 people,\n\n00:09:19.957 --> 00:09:22.292\ndoesn't speak to anyone else in a month.\n\n00:09:22.882 --> 00:09:25.156\nAnd we're not the only people\nwith this problem;\n\n00:09:25.180 --> 00:09:27.611\nthis problem touches the whole\nof the Western world.\n\n00:09:27.635 --> 00:09:29.933\nAnd it's even more acute\nin countries like China,\n\n00:09:29.957 --> 00:09:33.640\nwhere a process of rapid urbanization,\nmass migration, has left older people\n\n00:09:33.664 --> 00:09:35.208\nalone in the villages.\n\n00:09:35.232 --> 00:09:39.053\nAnd so the services that Beveridge\ndesigned and exported --\n\n00:09:39.077 --> 00:09:41.364\nthey can't address this kind of problem.\n\n00:09:41.388 --> 00:09:43.998\nLoneliness is like a collective\nrelational challenge,\n\n00:09:44.022 --> 00:09:47.869\nand it can't be addressed\nby a traditional bureaucratic response.\n\n00:09:48.444 --> 00:09:51.395\nSo some years ago,\nwanting to understand this problem,\n\n00:09:51.419 --> 00:09:54.292\nI started to work with a group\nof about 60 older people\n\n00:09:54.316 --> 00:09:56.137\nin South London, where I live.\n\n00:09:56.161 --> 00:09:58.236\nI went shopping, I played bingo,\n\n00:09:58.260 --> 00:10:00.423\nbut mainly I was just\nobserving and listening.\n\n00:10:00.447 --> 00:10:02.992\nI wanted to know\nwhat we could do differently.\n\n00:10:03.795 --> 00:10:06.623\nAnd if you ask them, people tell you\nthey want two things.\n\n00:10:06.647 --> 00:10:09.556\nThey want somebody to go up a ladder\nand change a light bulb,\n\n00:10:09.580 --> 00:10:11.878\nor to be there when they\ncome out of hospital.\n\n00:10:11.902 --> 00:10:14.256\nThey want on-demand, practical support.\n\n00:10:14.280 --> 00:10:15.838\nAnd they want to have fun.\n\n00:10:15.862 --> 00:10:19.080\nThey want to go out, do interesting things\nwith like-minded people,\n\n00:10:19.104 --> 00:10:22.824\nand make friends like we've all\nmade friends at every stage of our lives.\n\n00:10:23.436 --> 00:10:26.165\nSo we rented a phone line,\nhired a couple of handymen,\n\n00:10:26.189 --> 00:10:28.526\nand started a service we called \"Circle.\"\n\n00:10:28.550 --> 00:10:32.371\nAnd Circle offers its local membership\na toll-free 0 800 number\n\n00:10:32.395 --> 00:10:35.124\nthat they can call on demand\nfor any support.\n\n00:10:35.148 --> 00:10:37.317\nAnd people have called us\nfor so many reasons.\n\n00:10:37.341 --> 00:10:39.460\nThey've called because\ntheir pets are unwell,\n\n00:10:39.484 --> 00:10:42.758\ntheir DVD is broken, they've forgotten\nhow to use their mobile phone,\n\n00:10:42.782 --> 00:10:44.707\nor maybe they are coming out of hospital\n\n00:10:44.731 --> 00:10:46.384\nand they want someone to be there.\n\n00:10:46.408 --> 00:10:49.558\nAnd Circle also offers\na rich social calendar --\n\n00:10:49.582 --> 00:10:53.697\nknitting, darts, museum tours,\nhot air ballooning -- you name it.\n\n00:10:54.213 --> 00:10:58.608\nBut here's the interesting thing,\nthe really deep change:\n\n00:10:58.632 --> 00:11:01.843\nover time, the friendships\nthat have formed\n\n00:11:01.867 --> 00:11:04.421\nhave begun to replace the practical offer.\n\n00:11:04.922 --> 00:11:06.555\nSo let me tell you about Belinda.\n\n00:11:06.579 --> 00:11:10.815\nBelinda's a Circle member, and she was\ngoing into hospital for a hip operation,\n\n00:11:10.839 --> 00:11:14.823\nso she called her local Circle to say\nthey wouldn't see her for a bit.\n\n00:11:14.847 --> 00:11:18.647\nAnd Damon, who runs the local Circle,\ncalls her back and says, \"How can I help?\"\n\n00:11:18.671 --> 00:11:20.582\nAnd Belinda says, \"Oh no, I'm fine --\n\n00:11:20.606 --> 00:11:23.399\nJocelyn is doing the shopping,\nTony's doing the gardening,\n\n00:11:23.423 --> 00:11:26.120\nMelissa and Joe are going\nto come in and cook and chat.\"\n\n00:11:26.144 --> 00:11:29.151\nSo five Circle members\nhad organized themselves\n\n00:11:29.175 --> 00:11:31.079\nto take care of Belinda.\n\n00:11:32.081 --> 00:11:35.427\nAnd Belinda's 80, although she says\nthat she feels 25 inside,\n\n00:11:35.451 --> 00:11:37.015\nbut she also says\n\n00:11:37.039 --> 00:11:40.485\nthat she felt stuck and pretty down\nwhen she joined Circle.\n\n00:11:41.041 --> 00:11:45.522\nBut the simple act of encouraging her\nto come along to that first event\n\n00:11:45.546 --> 00:11:48.746\nled to a process where\nnatural friendships formed,\n\n00:11:48.770 --> 00:11:53.091\nfriendships that today are replacing\nthe need for expensive services.\n\n00:11:53.115 --> 00:11:56.092\nIt's relationships\nthat are making the difference.\n\n00:11:57.530 --> 00:12:00.438\nSo I think that three factors\nhave converged\n\n00:12:00.462 --> 00:12:03.454\nthat enable us to put relationships\nat the heart and center\n\n00:12:03.478 --> 00:12:06.323\nof how we solve social problems today.\n\n00:12:06.347 --> 00:12:08.410\nFirstly, the nature of the problems --\n\n00:12:08.434 --> 00:12:11.089\nthey've changed, and they require\ndifferent solutions.\n\n00:12:11.113 --> 00:12:15.603\nSecondly, the cost, human as much\nas financial, of doing business as usual.\n\n00:12:15.627 --> 00:12:17.362\nAnd thirdly, technology.\n\n00:12:17.967 --> 00:12:20.487\nI've talked about the first two factors.\n\n00:12:20.511 --> 00:12:23.459\nIt's technology that enables\nthese approaches to scale\n\n00:12:23.483 --> 00:12:26.437\nand potentially now support\nthousands of people.\n\n00:12:26.869 --> 00:12:29.028\nSo the technology we've used\nis really simple,\n\n00:12:29.052 --> 00:12:32.505\nit's made up of available things\nlike databases, mobile phones.\n\n00:12:32.529 --> 00:12:35.265\nCircle has got this very simple\nsystem that underpins it,\n\n00:12:35.289 --> 00:12:39.149\nenables a small local team to support\na membership of up to a thousand.\n\n00:12:39.173 --> 00:12:41.946\nAnd you can contrast this\nwith a neighborhood organization\n\n00:12:41.970 --> 00:12:43.127\nof the 1970s,\n\n00:12:43.151 --> 00:12:45.314\nwhen this kind of scale\njust wasn't possible,\n\n00:12:45.338 --> 00:12:49.454\nneither was the quality or the longevity\nthat the spine of technology can provide.\n\n00:12:49.478 --> 00:12:52.707\nSo it's relationships\nunderpinned by technology\n\n00:12:52.731 --> 00:12:55.644\nthat can turn the Beveridge\nmodels on their heads.\n\n00:12:55.668 --> 00:12:59.314\nThe Beveridge models are all\nabout institutions with finite resources,\n\n00:12:59.338 --> 00:13:01.779\nanonymously managing access.\n\n00:13:01.803 --> 00:13:03.423\nIn my work at the front line,\n\n00:13:03.447 --> 00:13:07.133\nI've seen again and again how\nup to 80 percent of resource\n\n00:13:07.157 --> 00:13:09.192\nis spent keeping people out.\n\n00:13:09.216 --> 00:13:10.906\nSo professionals have to administer\n\n00:13:10.930 --> 00:13:13.324\nthese increasingly complex forms\nof administration\n\n00:13:13.348 --> 00:13:16.690\nthat are basically about stopping people\naccessing the service\n\n00:13:16.714 --> 00:13:18.441\nor managing the queue.\n\n00:13:18.888 --> 00:13:23.224\nAnd Circle, like the relational services\nthat we and others have designed,\n\n00:13:23.248 --> 00:13:24.613\ninverts this logic.\n\n00:13:24.637 --> 00:13:28.630\nWhat it says is, the more people,\nthe more relationships,\n\n00:13:28.654 --> 00:13:30.710\nthe stronger the solution.\n\n00:13:31.692 --> 00:13:34.054\nSo I want to tell you my third\nand final story,\n\n00:13:34.078 --> 00:13:36.037\nwhich is about unemployment.\n\n00:13:37.258 --> 00:13:40.024\nIn Britain, as in most places\nin the world,\n\n00:13:40.048 --> 00:13:42.588\nour welfare states were primarily designed\n\n00:13:42.612 --> 00:13:45.257\nto get people into work,\n\n00:13:45.281 --> 00:13:47.273\nto educate them for this,\n\n00:13:47.297 --> 00:13:48.969\nand to keep them healthy.\n\n00:13:48.993 --> 00:13:51.526\nBut here, too, the systems are failing.\n\n00:13:51.550 --> 00:13:52.922\nAnd so the response has been\n\n00:13:52.946 --> 00:13:56.483\nto try and make these old systems\neven more efficient and transactional --\n\n00:13:56.507 --> 00:14:00.139\nto speed up processing times, divide\npeople into ever-smaller categories,\n\n00:14:00.163 --> 00:14:03.334\ntry and target services at them\nmore efficiently -- in other words,\n\n00:14:03.358 --> 00:14:06.004\nthe very opposite of relational.\n\n00:14:07.383 --> 00:14:10.787\nBut guess how most people find work today?\n\n00:14:11.541 --> 00:14:13.333\nThrough word of mouth.\n\n00:14:13.357 --> 00:14:17.958\nIt turns out that in Britain today,\nmost new jobs are not advertised.\n\n00:14:17.982 --> 00:14:20.125\nSo it's friends that tell you about a job,\n\n00:14:20.149 --> 00:14:22.422\nit's friends that recommend you for a job,\n\n00:14:22.446 --> 00:14:26.737\nand it's a rich and diverse social network\nthat helps you find work.\n\n00:14:26.761 --> 00:14:29.086\nMaybe some of you here\nthis evening are thinking,\n\n00:14:29.110 --> 00:14:30.971\n\"But I found my job through an advert,\"\n\n00:14:30.995 --> 00:14:34.317\nbut if you think back, it was probably\na friend that showed you the ad\n\n00:14:34.341 --> 00:14:35.918\nand then encouraged you to apply.\n\n00:14:35.942 --> 00:14:37.265\nBut not surprisingly,\n\n00:14:37.289 --> 00:14:40.568\npeople who perhaps most need\nthis rich and diverse network\n\n00:14:40.592 --> 00:14:43.291\nare those who are most isolated from it.\n\n00:14:43.315 --> 00:14:44.590\nSo knowing this,\n\n00:14:44.614 --> 00:14:47.636\nand also knowing about the costs\nand failure of current systems,\n\n00:14:47.660 --> 00:14:50.609\nwe designed something new\nwith relationships at its heart.\n\n00:14:50.633 --> 00:14:55.995\nWe designed a service\nthat encourages people to meet up,\n\n00:14:56.019 --> 00:14:57.459\npeople in and out of work,\n\n00:14:57.483 --> 00:14:59.234\nto work together in structured ways\n\n00:14:59.258 --> 00:15:01.175\nand try new opportunities.\n\n00:15:02.266 --> 00:15:06.237\nAnd, well, it's very hard to compare\nthe results of these new systems\n\n00:15:06.261 --> 00:15:07.933\nwith the old transactional models,\n\n00:15:07.957 --> 00:15:10.258\nbut it looks like,\nwith our first 1,000 members,\n\n00:15:10.282 --> 00:15:13.173\nwe outperformed existing services\nby a factor of three,\n\n00:15:13.197 --> 00:15:15.157\nat a fraction of the cost.\n\n00:15:15.181 --> 00:15:18.061\nAnd here, too, we've used technology,\n\n00:15:18.085 --> 00:15:21.483\nbut not to network people in the way\nthat a social platform would do.\n\n00:15:21.507 --> 00:15:25.109\nWe've used it to bring people face to face\nand connect them with each other,\n\n00:15:25.133 --> 00:15:28.550\nbuilding real relationships\nand supporting people to find work.\n\n00:15:30.266 --> 00:15:33.213\nAt the end of his life, in 1948,\n\n00:15:33.237 --> 00:15:35.226\nBeveridge wrote a third report.\n\n00:15:35.871 --> 00:15:39.232\nAnd in it he said he had made\na dreadful mistake.\n\n00:15:40.314 --> 00:15:44.137\nHe had left people\nand their communities out.\n\n00:15:45.069 --> 00:15:49.674\nAnd this omission, he said,\nled to seeing people,\n\n00:15:49.698 --> 00:15:51.833\nand people starting to see themselves,\n\n00:15:51.857 --> 00:15:55.642\nwithin the categories\nof the bureaucracies and the institutions.\n\n00:15:55.666 --> 00:15:58.431\nAnd human relationships\nwere already withering.\n\n00:15:59.254 --> 00:16:02.470\nBut unfortunately, this third report\nwas much less read\n\n00:16:02.494 --> 00:16:04.269\nthan Beveridge's earlier work.\n\n00:16:05.073 --> 00:16:09.284\nBut today, we need to bring people\nand their communities\n\n00:16:09.308 --> 00:16:13.435\nback into the heart of the way\nwe design new systems and new services,\n\n00:16:13.459 --> 00:16:15.966\nin an approach that I call\n\"Relational Welfare.\"\n\n00:16:15.990 --> 00:16:18.506\nWe need to leave behind\nthese old, transactional,\n\n00:16:18.530 --> 00:16:20.788\nunsuitable, outdated models,\n\n00:16:20.812 --> 00:16:24.323\nand we need to adopt instead\nthe shared collective relational responses\n\n00:16:24.347 --> 00:16:26.803\nthat can support a family like Ella's,\n\n00:16:26.827 --> 00:16:29.134\nthat can address an issue like loneliness,\n\n00:16:29.158 --> 00:16:31.893\nthat can support people into work\nand up the skills curve\n\n00:16:31.917 --> 00:16:33.361\nin a modern labor market,\n\n00:16:33.385 --> 00:16:37.523\nthat can also address challenges\nof education, of health care systems,\n\n00:16:37.547 --> 00:16:41.827\nand so many more of those problems\nthat are pressing on our societies.\n\n00:16:42.264 --> 00:16:44.826\nIt is all about relationships.\n\n00:16:45.282 --> 00:16:48.309\nRelationships are the critical\nresource we have.\n\n00:16:48.333 --> 00:16:49.484\nThank you.\n\n00:16:49.508 --> 00:16:54.957\n(Applause)"}, {"title": "How I teach kids to love science", "duration": "588", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/cesar_harada_how_i_teach_kids_to_love_science", "transcript": "When I was a kid, my parents would tell me, \"You can make a mess, but you have to clean up after yourself.\" So freedom came with responsibility. But my imagination would take me to all these wonderful places, where everything was possible. So I grew up in a bubble of innocence \u2014 or a bubble of ignorance, I should say, because adults would lie to us to protect us from the ugly truth. And growing up, I found out that adults make a mess, and they're not very good at cleaning up after themselves.Fast forward, I am an adult now, and I teach citizen science and invention at the Hong Kong Harbour School. And it doesn't take too long before my students walk on a beach and stumble upon piles of trash. So as good citizens, we clean up the beaches \u2014 and no, he is not drinking alcohol, and if he is, I did not give it to him.(Laughter)And so it's sad to say, but today more than 80 percent  of the oceans have plastic in them. It's a horrifying fact. And in past decades, we've been taking those big ships out and those big nets, and we collect those plastic bits that we look at under a microscope, and we sort them, and then we put this data onto a map. But that takes forever, it's very expensive, and so it's quite risky to take those big boats out.So with my students, ages six to 15, we've been dreaming of inventing a better way. So we've transformed our tiny Hong Kong classroom into a workshop. And so we started building this small workbench, with different heights, so even really short kids can participate. And let me tell you, kids with power tools are awesome and safe.(Laughter)Not really. And so, back to plastic. We collect this plastic and we grind it to the size we find it in the ocean, which is very small because it breaks down. And so this is how we work. I let the imaginations of my students run wild. And my job is to try to collect the best of each kid's idea and try to combine it into something that hopefully would work. And so we have agreed that instead of collecting plastic bits, we are going to collect only the data. So we're going to get an image of the plastic with a robot \u2014 so robots, kids get very excited. And the next thing we do \u2014 we do what we call \"rapid prototyping.\" We are so rapid at prototyping that the lunch is still in the lunchbox when we're hacking it.(Laughter)And we hack table lamps and webcams, into plumbing fixtures and we assemble that into a floating robot that will be slowly moving through water and through the plastic that we have there \u2014 and this is the image that we get in the robot. So we see the plastic pieces floating slowly through the sensor, and the computer on board will process this image, and measure the size of each particle, so we have a rough estimate of how much plastic there is in the water.So we documented this invention step by step on a website for inventors called Instructables, in the hope that somebody would make it even better.What was really cool about this project was that the students saw a local problem, and boom \u2014 they are trying to immediately address it.[I can investigate my local problem]But my students in Hong Kong are hyperconnected kids. And they watch the news, they watch the Internet, and they came across this image. This was a child, probably under 10, cleaning up an oil spill bare-handed, in the Sundarbans, which is the world's largest mangrove forest in Bangladesh. So they were very shocked, because this is the water they drink, this is the water they bathe in, this is the water they fish in \u2014 this is the place where they live. And also you can see the water is brown, the mud is brown and oil is brown, so when everything is mixed up, it's really hard to see what's in the water. But, there's a technology that's rather simple, that's called spectrometry, that allows you see what's in the water. So we built a rough prototype of a spectrometer, and you can shine light through different substances that produce different spectrums, so that can help you identify what's in the water. So we packed this prototype of a sensor, and we shipped it to Bangladesh. So what was cool about this project was that beyond addressing a local problem, or looking at a local problem, my students used their empathy and their sense of being creative to help, remotely, other kids.[I can investigate a remote problem]So I was very compelled by doing the second experiments, and I wanted to take it even further \u2014 maybe addressing an even harder problem, and it's also closer to my heart.So I'm half Japanese and half French, and maybe you remember in 2011 there was a massive earthquake in Japan. It was so violent that it triggered several giant waves \u2014 they are called tsunami \u2014 and those tsunami destroyed many cities on the eastern coast of Japan. More than 14,000 people died in an instant. Also, it damaged the nuclear power plant of Fukushima, the nuclear power plant just by the water. And today, I read the reports and an average of 300 tons are leaking from the nuclear power plant into the Pacific Ocean. And today the whole Pacific Ocean has traces of contamination of cesium-137. If you go outside on the West Coast, you can measure Fukushima everywhere. But if you look at the map, it can look like most of the radioactivity has been washed away from the Japanese coast, and most of it is now \u2014 it looks like it's safe, it's blue. Well, reality is a bit more complicated than this.So I've been going to Fukushima every year since the accident, and I measure independently and with other scientists, on land, in the river \u2014 and this time we wanted to take the kids. So of course we didn't take the kids, the parents wouldn't allow that to happen.(Laughter)But every night we would report to \"Mission Control\" \u2014 different masks they're wearing. It could look like they didn't take the work seriously, but they really did because they're going to have to live with radioactivity their whole life. And so what we did with them is that we'd discuss the data we collected that day, and talk about where we should be going next \u2014 strategy, itinerary, etc... And to do this, we built a very rough topographical map of the region around the nuclear power plant. And so we built the elevation map, we sprinkled pigments to represent real-time data for radioactivity, and we sprayed water to simulate the rainfall. And with this we could see that the radioactive dust was washing from the top of the mountain into the river system, and leaking into the ocean. So it was a rough estimate.But with this in mind, we organized this expedition, which was the closest civilians have been to the nuclear power plant. We are sailing 1.5 kilometers away from the nuclear power plant, and with the help of the local fisherman, we are collecting sediment from the seabed with a custom sediment sampler we've invented and built. We pack the sediment into small bags, we then dispatch them to hundreds of small bags that we send to different universities, and we produce the map of the seabed radioactivity, especially in estuaries where the fish will reproduce, and I will hope that we will have improved the safety of the local fishermen and of your favorite sushi.(Laughter)You can see a progression here \u2014 we've gone from a local problem to a remote problem to a global problem. And it's been super exciting to work at these different scales, with also very simple, open-source technologies. But at the same time, it's been increasingly frustrating because we have only started to measure the damage that we have done. We haven't even started to try to solve the problems. And so I wonder if we should just take a leap and try to invent better ways to do all these things.And so the classroom started to feel a little bit small, so we found an industrial site in Hong Kong, and we turned it into the largest mega-space focused on social and environmental impact. It's in central Hong Kong, and it's a place we can work with wood, metal, chemistry, a bit of biology, a bit of optics, basically you can build pretty much everything there. And its a place where adults and kids can play together. It's a place where kids' dreams can come true, with the help of adults, and where adults can be kids again.Student: Acceleration! Acceleration!Cesar Harada: We're asking questions such as, can we invent the future of mobility with renewable energy? For example. Or, can we help the mobility of the aging population by transforming very standard wheelchairs into cool, electric vehicles?So plastic, oil and radioactivity are horrible, horrible legacies, but the very worst legacy that we can leave our children is lies. We can no longer afford to shield the kids from the ugly truth because we need their imagination to invent the solutions.So citizen scientists, makers, dreamers \u2014 we must prepare the next generation that cares about the environment and people, and that can actually do something about it.Thank you.(Applause)", "id": 2363, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:13.758 --> 00:00:16.574\nWhen I was a kid,\nmy parents would tell me,\n\n00:00:16.598 --> 00:00:19.997\n\"You can make a mess,\nbut you have to clean up after yourself.\"\n\n00:00:20.398 --> 00:00:23.734\nSo freedom came with responsibility.\n\n00:00:23.758 --> 00:00:27.334\nBut my imagination would take me\nto all these wonderful places,\n\n00:00:27.358 --> 00:00:29.454\nwhere everything was possible.\n\n00:00:29.478 --> 00:00:32.374\nSo I grew up in a bubble of innocence --\n\n00:00:32.398 --> 00:00:34.734\nor a bubble of ignorance, I should say,\n\n00:00:34.758 --> 00:00:39.854\nbecause adults would lie to us\nto protect us from the ugly truth.\n\n00:00:39.878 --> 00:00:43.454\nAnd growing up, I found out\nthat adults make a mess,\n\n00:00:43.478 --> 00:00:46.278\nand they're not very good\nat cleaning up after themselves.\n\n00:00:47.318 --> 00:00:49.454\nFast forward, I am an adult now,\n\n00:00:49.478 --> 00:00:54.454\nand I teach citizen science and invention\nat the Hong Kong Harbour School.\n\n00:00:54.478 --> 00:00:55.814\nAnd it doesn't take too long\n\n00:00:55.838 --> 00:01:00.054\nbefore my students walk on a beach\nand stumble upon piles of trash.\n\n00:01:00.078 --> 00:01:02.734\nSo as good citizens,\nwe clean up the beaches --\n\n00:01:02.758 --> 00:01:07.478\nand no, he is not drinking alcohol,\nand if he is, I did not give it to him.\n\n00:01:07.838 --> 00:01:09.598\n(Laughter)\n\n00:01:09.918 --> 00:01:11.134\nAnd so it's sad to say,\n\n00:01:11.158 --> 00:01:14.934\nbut today more than 80 percent \nof the oceans have plastic in them.\n\n00:01:14.958 --> 00:01:16.238\nIt's a horrifying fact.\n\n00:01:16.758 --> 00:01:18.134\nAnd in past decades,\n\n00:01:18.158 --> 00:01:21.614\nwe've been taking those big ships out\nand those big nets,\n\n00:01:21.638 --> 00:01:24.974\nand we collect those plastic bits\nthat we look at under a microscope,\n\n00:01:24.998 --> 00:01:26.214\nand we sort them,\n\n00:01:26.238 --> 00:01:28.000\nand then we put this data onto a map.\n\n00:01:28.398 --> 00:01:30.734\nBut that takes forever,\nit's very expensive,\n\n00:01:30.758 --> 00:01:33.894\nand so it's quite risky\nto take those big boats out.\n\n00:01:33.918 --> 00:01:36.854\nSo with my students, ages six to 15,\n\n00:01:36.878 --> 00:01:39.094\nwe've been dreaming\nof inventing a better way.\n\n00:01:39.118 --> 00:01:43.534\nSo we've transformed our tiny\nHong Kong classroom into a workshop.\n\n00:01:43.558 --> 00:01:46.214\nAnd so we started building\nthis small workbench,\n\n00:01:46.238 --> 00:01:49.414\nwith different heights,\nso even really short kids can participate.\n\n00:01:49.438 --> 00:01:53.614\nAnd let me tell you, kids with power tools\nare awesome and safe.\n\n00:01:53.638 --> 00:01:54.974\n(Laughter)\n\n00:01:54.998 --> 00:01:56.894\nNot really.\n\n00:01:56.918 --> 00:01:58.134\nAnd so, back to plastic.\n\n00:01:58.158 --> 00:02:01.774\nWe collect this plastic and we grind it\nto the size we find it in the ocean,\n\n00:02:01.798 --> 00:02:03.974\nwhich is very small\nbecause it breaks down.\n\n00:02:03.998 --> 00:02:05.374\nAnd so this is how we work.\n\n00:02:05.398 --> 00:02:08.534\nI let the imaginations\nof my students run wild.\n\n00:02:08.558 --> 00:02:12.814\nAnd my job is to try to collect\nthe best of each kid's idea\n\n00:02:12.838 --> 00:02:17.118\nand try to combine it into something\nthat hopefully would work.\n\n00:02:17.878 --> 00:02:21.014\nAnd so we have agreed\nthat instead of collecting plastic bits,\n\n00:02:21.038 --> 00:02:23.014\nwe are going to collect only the data.\n\n00:02:23.038 --> 00:02:26.014\nSo we're going to get an image\nof the plastic with a robot --\n\n00:02:26.038 --> 00:02:28.414\nso robots, kids get very excited.\n\n00:02:28.438 --> 00:02:31.581\nAnd the next thing we do --\nwe do what we call \"rapid prototyping.\"\n\n00:02:31.605 --> 00:02:33.294\nWe are so rapid at prototyping\n\n00:02:33.318 --> 00:02:36.494\nthat the lunch is still in the lunchbox\nwhen we're hacking it.\n\n00:02:36.518 --> 00:02:37.814\n(Laughter)\n\n00:02:37.838 --> 00:02:42.094\nAnd we hack table lamps and webcams,\ninto plumbing fixtures\n\n00:02:42.118 --> 00:02:47.254\nand we assemble that into a floating robot\nthat will be slowly moving through water\n\n00:02:47.278 --> 00:02:49.374\nand through the plastic\nthat we have there --\n\n00:02:49.398 --> 00:02:51.589\nand this is the image\nthat we get in the robot.\n\n00:02:51.613 --> 00:02:55.334\nSo we see the plastic pieces\nfloating slowly through the sensor,\n\n00:02:55.358 --> 00:02:58.654\nand the computer on board\nwill process this image,\n\n00:02:58.678 --> 00:03:00.774\nand measure the size of each particle,\n\n00:03:00.798 --> 00:03:04.918\nso we have a rough estimate\nof how much plastic there is in the water.\n\n00:03:05.478 --> 00:03:08.494\nSo we documented\nthis invention step by step\n\n00:03:08.518 --> 00:03:11.894\non a website for inventors\ncalled Instructables,\n\n00:03:11.918 --> 00:03:14.718\nin the hope that somebody\nwould make it even better.\n\n00:03:15.796 --> 00:03:19.654\nWhat was really cool about this project\nwas that the students saw a local problem,\n\n00:03:19.678 --> 00:03:22.345\nand boom -- they are trying\nto immediately address it.\n\n00:03:22.369 --> 00:03:24.694\n[I can investigate my local problem]\n\n00:03:24.718 --> 00:03:27.934\nBut my students in Hong Kong\nare hyperconnected kids.\n\n00:03:27.958 --> 00:03:30.254\nAnd they watch the news,\nthey watch the Internet,\n\n00:03:30.278 --> 00:03:32.518\nand they came across this image.\n\n00:03:33.798 --> 00:03:38.534\nThis was a child, probably under 10,\ncleaning up an oil spill bare-handed,\n\n00:03:38.558 --> 00:03:43.054\nin the Sundarbans, which is the world's\nlargest mangrove forest in Bangladesh.\n\n00:03:43.078 --> 00:03:45.534\nSo they were very shocked,\n\n00:03:45.558 --> 00:03:48.854\nbecause this is the water they drink,\nthis is the water they bathe in,\n\n00:03:48.878 --> 00:03:52.254\nthis is the water they fish in --\nthis is the place where they live.\n\n00:03:52.278 --> 00:03:56.174\nAnd also you can see the water is brown,\nthe mud is brown and oil is brown,\n\n00:03:56.198 --> 00:03:57.675\nso when everything is mixed up,\n\n00:03:57.699 --> 00:04:00.174\nit's really hard to see\nwhat's in the water.\n\n00:04:00.198 --> 00:04:02.454\nBut, there's a technology\nthat's rather simple,\n\n00:04:02.478 --> 00:04:04.014\nthat's called spectrometry,\n\n00:04:04.038 --> 00:04:05.943\nthat allows you see what's in the water.\n\n00:04:05.967 --> 00:04:09.014\nSo we built a rough prototype\nof a spectrometer,\n\n00:04:09.038 --> 00:04:11.974\nand you can shine light\nthrough different substances\n\n00:04:11.998 --> 00:04:14.414\nthat produce different spectrums,\n\n00:04:14.438 --> 00:04:18.294\nso that can help you\nidentify what's in the water.\n\n00:04:18.318 --> 00:04:21.214\nSo we packed this prototype of a sensor,\n\n00:04:21.238 --> 00:04:23.478\nand we shipped it to Bangladesh.\n\n00:04:23.947 --> 00:04:25.614\nSo what was cool about this project\n\n00:04:25.638 --> 00:04:28.773\nwas that beyond addressing\na local problem,\n\n00:04:28.797 --> 00:04:30.227\nor looking at a local problem,\n\n00:04:30.251 --> 00:04:34.174\nmy students used their empathy\nand their sense of being creative\n\n00:04:34.198 --> 00:04:36.454\nto help, remotely, other kids.\n\n00:04:36.478 --> 00:04:38.193\n[I can investigate a remote problem]\n\n00:04:38.217 --> 00:04:40.837\nSo I was very compelled\nby doing the second experiments,\n\n00:04:40.861 --> 00:04:43.374\nand I wanted to take it even further --\n\n00:04:43.398 --> 00:04:47.998\nmaybe addressing an even harder problem,\nand it's also closer to my heart.\n\n00:04:48.518 --> 00:04:51.134\nSo I'm half Japanese and half French,\n\n00:04:51.158 --> 00:04:56.478\nand maybe you remember in 2011\nthere was a massive earthquake in Japan.\n\n00:04:57.078 --> 00:05:00.894\nIt was so violent that it triggered\nseveral giant waves --\n\n00:05:00.918 --> 00:05:02.334\nthey are called tsunami --\n\n00:05:02.358 --> 00:05:09.318\nand those tsunami destroyed many cities\non the eastern coast of Japan.\n\n00:05:10.638 --> 00:05:13.998\nMore than 14,000 people\ndied in an instant.\n\n00:05:15.558 --> 00:05:19.294\nAlso, it damaged the nuclear\npower plant of Fukushima,\n\n00:05:19.318 --> 00:05:21.998\nthe nuclear power plant just by the water.\n\n00:05:22.438 --> 00:05:24.854\nAnd today, I read the reports\n\n00:05:24.878 --> 00:05:27.934\nand an average of 300 tons\n\n00:05:27.958 --> 00:05:31.534\nare leaking from the nuclear power plant\ninto the Pacific Ocean.\n\n00:05:31.558 --> 00:05:37.934\nAnd today the whole Pacific Ocean\nhas traces of contamination of cesium-137.\n\n00:05:37.958 --> 00:05:42.374\nIf you go outside on the West Coast,\nyou can measure Fukushima everywhere.\n\n00:05:42.398 --> 00:05:45.694\nBut if you look at the map,\nit can look like most of the radioactivity\n\n00:05:45.718 --> 00:05:47.814\nhas been washed away\nfrom the Japanese coast,\n\n00:05:47.838 --> 00:05:50.654\nand most of it is now --\nit looks like it's safe, it's blue.\n\n00:05:50.678 --> 00:05:54.094\nWell, reality is a bit\nmore complicated than this.\n\n00:05:54.118 --> 00:05:57.774\nSo I've been going to Fukushima\nevery year since the accident,\n\n00:05:57.798 --> 00:06:00.334\nand I measure independently\nand with other scientists,\n\n00:06:00.358 --> 00:06:02.214\non land, in the river --\n\n00:06:02.238 --> 00:06:04.974\nand this time we wanted to take the kids.\n\n00:06:04.998 --> 00:06:08.774\nSo of course we didn't take the kids,\nthe parents wouldn't allow that to happen.\n\n00:06:08.798 --> 00:06:10.134\n(Laughter)\n\n00:06:10.158 --> 00:06:14.094\nBut every night we would report\nto \"Mission Control\" --\n\n00:06:14.118 --> 00:06:16.294\ndifferent masks they're wearing.\n\n00:06:16.318 --> 00:06:20.694\nIt could look like they didn't take\nthe work seriously, but they really did\n\n00:06:20.718 --> 00:06:24.918\nbecause they're going to have to live\nwith radioactivity their whole life.\n\n00:06:25.598 --> 00:06:27.654\nAnd so what we did with them\n\n00:06:27.678 --> 00:06:30.294\nis that we'd discuss the data\nwe collected that day,\n\n00:06:30.318 --> 00:06:32.509\nand talk about where\nwe should be going next --\n\n00:06:32.533 --> 00:06:34.654\nstrategy, itinerary, etc...\n\n00:06:34.678 --> 00:06:38.294\nAnd to do this, we built\na very rough topographical map\n\n00:06:38.318 --> 00:06:41.174\nof the region around\nthe nuclear power plant.\n\n00:06:41.198 --> 00:06:43.214\nAnd so we built the elevation map,\n\n00:06:43.238 --> 00:06:47.854\nwe sprinkled pigments to represent\nreal-time data for radioactivity,\n\n00:06:47.878 --> 00:06:52.214\nand we sprayed water\nto simulate the rainfall.\n\n00:06:52.238 --> 00:06:55.214\nAnd with this we could see\nthat the radioactive dust\n\n00:06:55.238 --> 00:06:58.294\nwas washing from the top of the mountain\ninto the river system,\n\n00:06:58.318 --> 00:06:59.854\nand leaking into the ocean.\n\n00:06:59.878 --> 00:07:01.478\nSo it was a rough estimate.\n\n00:07:02.638 --> 00:07:05.574\nBut with this in mind,\nwe organized this expedition,\n\n00:07:05.598 --> 00:07:09.214\nwhich was the closest civilians have been\nto the nuclear power plant.\n\n00:07:09.238 --> 00:07:13.574\nWe are sailing 1.5 kilometers away\nfrom the nuclear power plant,\n\n00:07:13.598 --> 00:07:15.551\nand with the help of the local fisherman,\n\n00:07:15.575 --> 00:07:17.814\nwe are collecting sediment from the seabed\n\n00:07:17.838 --> 00:07:21.294\nwith a custom sediment sampler\nwe've invented and built.\n\n00:07:21.318 --> 00:07:24.574\nWe pack the sediment into small bags,\n\n00:07:24.598 --> 00:07:26.854\nwe then dispatch them\nto hundreds of small bags\n\n00:07:26.878 --> 00:07:28.814\nthat we send to different universities,\n\n00:07:28.838 --> 00:07:31.814\nand we produce the map\nof the seabed radioactivity,\n\n00:07:31.838 --> 00:07:34.374\nespecially in estuaries\nwhere the fish will reproduce,\n\n00:07:34.398 --> 00:07:36.454\nand I will hope that we will have improved\n\n00:07:36.478 --> 00:07:39.574\nthe safety of the local fishermen\nand of your favorite sushi.\n\n00:07:39.598 --> 00:07:40.894\n(Laughter)\n\n00:07:40.918 --> 00:07:42.494\nYou can see a progression here --\n\n00:07:42.518 --> 00:07:47.054\nwe've gone from a local problem\nto a remote problem to a global problem.\n\n00:07:47.078 --> 00:07:50.031\nAnd it's been super exciting\nto work at these different scales,\n\n00:07:50.055 --> 00:07:53.614\nwith also very simple,\nopen-source technologies.\n\n00:07:53.638 --> 00:07:56.974\nBut at the same time,\nit's been increasingly frustrating\n\n00:07:56.998 --> 00:08:00.694\nbecause we have only started to measure\nthe damage that we have done.\n\n00:08:00.718 --> 00:08:04.798\nWe haven't even started\nto try to solve the problems.\n\n00:08:05.598 --> 00:08:08.374\nAnd so I wonder\nif we should just take a leap\n\n00:08:08.398 --> 00:08:13.038\nand try to invent better ways\nto do all these things.\n\n00:08:13.478 --> 00:08:17.054\nAnd so the classroom\nstarted to feel a little bit small,\n\n00:08:17.078 --> 00:08:19.774\nso we found an industrial\nsite in Hong Kong,\n\n00:08:19.798 --> 00:08:23.054\nand we turned it into\nthe largest mega-space\n\n00:08:23.078 --> 00:08:26.254\nfocused on social\nand environmental impact.\n\n00:08:26.278 --> 00:08:27.574\nIt's in central Hong Kong,\n\n00:08:27.598 --> 00:08:30.814\nand it's a place we can work\nwith wood, metal, chemistry,\n\n00:08:30.838 --> 00:08:32.464\na bit of biology, a bit of optics,\n\n00:08:32.488 --> 00:08:34.980\nbasically you can

It means to play softly. If you're playing a musical instrument and you notice a \"p\" in the score, you need to play softer. Two p's \u2014 even softer. Four p's \u2014 extremely soft. This is my drawing of a p-tree, which demonstrates no matter how many thousands upon thousands of p's there may be, you'll never reach complete silence. That's my current definition of silence: a very obscure sound.I'd like to share a little bit about the history of American Sign Language, ASL, plus a bit of my own background. French sign language was brought to America during the early 1800s, and as time went by, mixed with local signs, it evolved into the language we know today as ASL. So it has a history of about 200 years.I was born deaf, and I was taught to believe that sound wasn't a part of my life. And I believed it to be true. Yet, I realize now that that wasn't the case at all. Sound was very much a part of my life, really, on my mind every day. As a Deaf person living in a world of sound, it's as if I was living in a foreign country, blindly following its rules, customs, behaviors and norms without ever questioning them.So how is it that I understand sound? Well, I watch how people behave and respond to sound. You people are like my loudspeakers, and amplify sound. I learn and mirror that behavior. At the same time, I've learned that I create sound, and I've seen how people respond to me. Thus I've learned, for example ... \"Don't slam the door!\" \"Don't make too much noise when you're eating from the potato-chip bag!\"(Laughter)\"Don't burp, and when you're eating, make sure you don't scrape your utensils on the plate.\" All of these things I term \"sound etiquette.\" Maybe I think about sound etiquette more than the average hearing person does. I'm hyper-vigilant around sound. And I'm always waiting in eager nervous anticipation around sound, about what's to come next.Hence, this drawing. TBD, to be decided. TBC, to be continued. TBA, to be announced. And you notice the staff \u2014 there are no notes contained in the lines. That's because the lines already contain sound through the subtle smudges and smears.In Deaf culture, movement is equivalent to sound. This is a sign for \"staff\" in ASL. A typical staff contains five lines. Yet for me, signing it with my thumb sticking up like that doesn't feel natural. That's why you'll notice in my drawings, I stick to four lines on paper.In the year 2008, I had the opportunity to travel to Berlin, Germany, for an artist residency there. Prior to this time, I had been working as a painter. During this summer, I visited different museums and gallery spaces, and as I went from one place to the next, I noticed there was no visual art there. At that time, sound was trending, and this struck me ... there was no visual art, everything was auditory.Now sound has come into my art territory. Is it going to further distance me from art? I realized that doesn't have to be the case at all. I actually know sound. I know it so well that it doesn't have to be something just experienced through the ears. It could be felt tactually, or experienced as a visual, or even as an idea.So I decided to reclaim ownership of sound and to put it into my art practice. And everything that I had been taught regarding sound, I decided to do away with and unlearn. I started creating a new body of work. And when I presented this to the art community, I was blown away with the amount of support and attention I received. I realized: sound is like money, power, control \u2014 social currency. In the back of my mind, I've always felt that sound was your thing, a hearing person's thing. And sound is so powerful that it could either disempower me and my artwork, or it could empower me. I chose to be empowered.There's a massive culture around spoken language. And just because I don't use my literal voice to communicate, in society's eyes it's as if I don't have a voice at all. So I need to work with individuals who can support me as an equal and become my voice. And that way, I'm able to maintain relevancy in society today.So at school, at work and institutions, I work with many different ASL interpreters. And their voice becomes my voice and identity. They help me to be heard. And their voices hold value and currency. Ironically, by borrowing out their voices, I'm able to maintain a temporary form of currency, kind of like taking out a loan with a very high interest rate. If I didn't continue this practice, I feel that I could just fade off into oblivion and not maintain any form of social currency.So with sound as my new art medium, I delved into the world of music. And I was surprised to see the similarities between music and ASL. For example, a musical note cannot be fully captured and expressed on paper. And the same holds true for a concept in ASL. They're both highly spatial and highly inflected \u2014 meaning that subtle changes can affect the entire meaning of both signs and sounds.I'd like to share with you a piano metaphor, to have you have a better understanding of how ASL works. So, envision a piano. ASL is broken down into many different grammatical parameters. If you assign a different parameter to each finger as you play the piano \u2014 such as facial expression, body movement, speed, hand shape and so on, as you play the piano \u2014 English is a linear language, as if one key is being pressed at a time. However, ASL is more like a chord \u2014 all 10 fingers need to come down simultaneously to express a clear concept or idea in ASL. If just one of those keys were to change the chord, it would create a completely different meaning. The same applies to music in regards to pitch, tone and volume. In ASL, by playing around with these different grammatical parameters, you can express different ideas.For example, take the sign TO-LOOK-AT. This is the sign TO-LOOK-AT. I'm looking at you. Staring at you.(Laughter)(Laughter)Oh \u2014 busted.(Laughter)Uh-oh. What are you looking at? Aw, stop.(Laughter)I then started thinking, \"What if I was to look at ASL through a musical lens?\" If I was to create a sign and repeat it over and over, it could become like a piece of visual music. For example, this is the sign for \"day,\" as the sun rises and sets. This is \"all day.\" If I was to repeat it and slow it down, visually it looks like a piece of music. All ... day. I feel the same holds true for \"all night.\" \"All night.\" This is ALL-NIGHT, represented in this drawing. And this led me to thinking about three different kinds of nights: \"last night,\" \"overnight,\" (Sings) \"all night long.\"(Laughter)I feel like the third one has a lot more musicality than the other two.(Laughter)This represents how time is expressed in ASL and how the distance from your body can express the changes in time. For example, 1H is one hand, 2H is two hand, present tense happens closest and in front of the body, future is in front of the body and the past is to your back. So, the first example is \"a long time ago.\" Then \"past,\" \"used to\" and the last one, which is my favorite, with the very romantic and dramatic notion to it, \"once upon a time.\"(Laughter)\"Common time\" is a musical term with a specific time signature of four beats per measure. Yet when I see the word \"common time,\" what automatically comes to mind for me is \"at the same time.\" So notice RH: right hand, LH: left hand. We have the staff across the head and the chest.[Head: RH, Flash claw][Common time][Chest: LH, Flash claw]I'm now going to demonstrate a hand shape called the \"flash claw.\" Can you please follow along with me? Everybody, hands up. Now we're going to do it in both the head and the chest, kind of like \"common time\" or at the same time. Yes, got it. That means \"to fall in love\" in International [Sign].(Laughter)International [Sign], as a note, is a visual tool to help communicate across cultures and sign languages around the world.The second one I'd like to demonstrate is this \u2014 please follow along with me again. And now this. This is \"colonization\" in ASL.(Laughter)Now the third \u2014 please follow along again. And again. This is \"enlightenment\" in ASL. So let's do all three together. \"Fall in love,\" \"colonization\" and \"enlightenment.\" Good job, everyone.(Laughter)Notice how all three signs are very similar, they all happen at the head and the chest, but they convey quite different meanings.So it's amazing to see how ASL is alive and thriving, just like music is. However, in this day and age, we live in a very audio-centric world. And just because ASL has no sound to it, it automatically holds no social currency. We need to start thinking harder about what defines social currency and allow ASL to develop its own form of currency \u2014 without sound. And this could possibly be a step to lead to a more inclusive society. And maybe people will understand that you don't need to be deaf to learn ASL, nor do you have to be hearing to learn music.ASL is such a rich treasure that I'd like you to have the same experience. And I'd like to invite you to open your ears, to open your eyes, take part in our culture and experience our visual language. And you never know, you might just fall in love with us.(Applause)Thank you.Denise Kahler-Braaten: Hey, that's me.(Applause)", "id": 2357, "subtitle":

delved into the world of music.\n\n00:07:35.047 --> 00:07:39.023\nAnd I was surprised to see\nthe similarities between music and ASL.\n\n00:07:41.144 --> 00:07:42.661\nFor example,\n\n00:07:42.685 --> 00:07:45.037\na musical note\n\n00:07:45.061 --> 00:07:48.084\ncannot be fully captured\nand expressed on paper.\n\n00:07:48.741 --> 00:07:51.793\nAnd the same holds true\nfor a concept in ASL.\n\n00:07:53.568 --> 00:07:57.582\nThey're both highly spatial\nand highly inflected --\n\n00:08:02.171 --> 00:08:04.328\nmeaning that subtle changes\n\n00:08:04.352 --> 00:08:06.861\ncan affect the entire meaning\n\n00:08:06.885 --> 00:08:08.669\nof both signs and sounds.\n\n00:08:11.856 --> 00:08:14.078\nI'd like to share with you\na piano metaphor,\n\n00:08:14.102 --> 00:08:17.087\nto have you have a better\nunderstanding of how ASL works.\n\n00:08:17.111 --> 00:08:18.669\nSo, envision a piano.\n\n00:08:20.257 --> 00:08:23.612\nASL is broken down into\nmany different grammatical parameters.\n\n00:08:24.729 --> 00:08:28.789\nIf you assign a different parameter\nto each finger as you play the piano --\n\n00:08:28.813 --> 00:08:33.818\nsuch as facial expression, body movement,\n\n00:08:33.842 --> 00:08:37.614\nspeed, hand shape and so on,\n\n00:08:37.638 --> 00:08:39.846\nas you play the piano --\n\n00:08:39.870 --> 00:08:41.707\nEnglish is a linear language,\n\n00:08:41.731 --> 00:08:44.536\nas if one key is being pressed at a time.\n\n00:08:44.560 --> 00:08:48.208\nHowever, ASL is more like a chord --\n\n00:08:48.232 --> 00:08:51.616\nall 10 fingers need\nto come down simultaneously\n\n00:08:51.640 --> 00:08:55.262\nto express a clear concept or idea in ASL.\n\n00:08:57.506 --> 00:09:01.532\nIf just one of those keys\nwere to change the chord,\n\n00:09:01.556 --> 00:09:03.749\nit would create a completely\ndifferent meaning.\n\n00:09:04.110 --> 00:09:08.384\nThe same applies to music\nin regards to pitch, tone and volume.\n\n00:09:12.476 --> 00:09:16.054\nIn ASL, by playing around with these\ndifferent grammatical parameters,\n\n00:09:16.078 --> 00:09:17.771\nyou can express different ideas.\n\n00:09:17.795 --> 00:09:19.780\nFor example, take the sign TO-LOOK-AT.\n\n00:09:20.198 --> 00:09:21.906\nThis is the sign TO-LOOK-AT.\n\n00:09:24.657 --> 00:09:25.908\nI'm looking at you.\n\n00:09:28.014 --> 00:09:29.314\nStaring at you.\n\n00:09:29.338 --> 00:09:31.052\n(Laughter)\n\n00:09:33.061 --> 00:09:34.358\n(Laughter)\n\n00:09:35.691 --> 00:09:38.357\nOh -- busted.\n\n00:09:38.381 --> 00:09:39.531\n(Laughter)\n\n00:09:41.566 --> 00:09:42.737\nUh-oh.\n\n00:09:45.479 --> 00:09:46.893\nWhat are you looking at?\n\n00:09:49.368 --> 00:09:50.696\nAw, stop.\n\n00:09:50.720 --> 00:09:52.389\n(Laughter)\n\n00:09:52.413 --> 00:09:53.597\nI then started thinking,\n\n00:09:53.621 --> 00:09:56.538\n\"What if I was to look at ASL\nthrough a musical lens?\"\n\n00:09:56.969 --> 00:10:00.176\nIf I was to create a sign\nand repeat it over and over,\n\n00:10:00.200 --> 00:10:02.589\nit could become\nlike a piece of visual music.\n\n00:10:03.974 --> 00:10:07.610\nFor example, this is the sign for \"day,\"\n\n00:10:07.634 --> 00:10:09.806\nas the sun rises and sets.\n\n00:10:11.747 --> 00:10:14.087\nThis is \"all day.\"\n\n00:10:16.374 --> 00:10:19.575\nIf I was to repeat it and slow it down,\n\n00:10:19.599 --> 00:10:21.764\nvisually it looks like a piece of music.\n\n00:10:23.981 --> 00:10:26.440\nAll ... day.\n\n00:10:27.144 --> 00:10:31.042\nI feel the same holds true\nfor \"all night.\"\n\n00:10:33.734 --> 00:10:34.888\n\"All night.\"\n\n00:10:35.848 --> 00:10:39.083\nThis is ALL-NIGHT,\nrepresented in this drawing.\n\n00:10:42.459 --> 00:10:45.672\nAnd this led me to thinking\nabout three different kinds of nights:\n\n00:10:49.785 --> 00:10:50.935\n\"last night,\"\n\n00:10:52.705 --> 00:10:53.857\n\"overnight,\"\n\n00:10:57.507 --> 00:11:00.261\n(Sings) \"all night long.\"\n\n00:11:00.285 --> 00:11:02.546\n(Laughter)\n\n00:11:07.819 --> 00:11:11.164\nI feel like the third one has\na lot more musicality than the other two.\n\n00:11:11.188 --> 00:11:12.339\n(Laughter)\n\n00:11:13.371 --> 00:11:16.406\nThis represents how time\nis expressed in ASL\n\n00:11:16.430 --> 00:11:20.889\nand how the distance from your body\ncan express the changes in time.\n\n00:11:20.913 --> 00:11:22.552\nFor example,\n\n00:11:22.576 --> 00:11:25.715\n1H is one hand, 2H is two hand,\n\n00:11:25.739 --> 00:11:28.969\npresent tense happens closest\nand in front of the body,\n\n00:11:28.993 --> 00:11:32.430\nfuture is in front of the body\nand the past is to your back.\n\n00:11:36.167 --> 00:11:38.998\nSo, the first example\nis \"a long time ago.\"\n\n00:11:40.167 --> 00:11:41.328\nThen \"past,\"\n\n00:11:44.496 --> 00:11:46.189\n\"used to\"\n\n00:11:46.213 --> 00:11:48.248\nand the last one, which is my favorite,\n\n00:11:48.272 --> 00:11:50.898\nwith the very romantic\nand dramatic notion to it,\n\n00:11:50.922 --> 00:11:52.511\n\"once upon a time.\"\n\n00:11:52.535 --> 00:11:53.944\n(Laughter)\n\n00:11:57.920 --> 00:12:00.637\n\"Common time\"\n\n00:12:00.661 --> 00:12:02.429\nis a musical term\n\n00:12:02.453 --> 00:12:06.436\nwith a specific time signature\nof four beats per measure.\n\n00:12:07.572 --> 00:12:09.384\nYet when I see the word \"common time,\"\n\n00:12:09.408 --> 00:12:12.564\nwhat automatically comes to mind for me\nis \"at the same time.\"\n\n00:12:13.603 --> 00:12:16.814\nSo notice RH: right hand, LH: left hand.\n\n00:12:17.536 --> 00:12:20.155\nWe have the staff\nacross the head and the chest.\n\n00:12:20.179 --> 00:12:21.361\n[Head: RH, Flash claw]\n\n00:12:21.385 --> 00:12:22.635\n[Common time]\n\n00:12:22.659 --> 00:12:24.192\n[Chest: LH, Flash claw]\n\n00:12:25.670 --> 00:12:28.768\nI'm now going to demonstrate\na hand shape called the \"flash claw.\"\n\n00:12:30.680 --> 00:12:32.657\nCan you please follow along with me?\n\n00:12:33.681 --> 00:12:35.025\nEverybody, hands up.\n\n00:12:38.734 --> 00:12:41.432\nNow we're going to do it\nin both the head and the chest,\n\n00:12:41.456 --> 00:12:43.830\nkind of like \"common time\"\nor at the same time.\n\n00:12:47.553 --> 00:12:48.854\nYes, got it.\n\n00:12:49.287 --> 00:12:52.102\nThat means \"to fall in love\"\nin International [Sign].\n\n00:12:52.126 --> 00:12:54.003\n(Laughter)\n\n00:12:54.027 --> 00:12:55.930\nInternational [Sign], as a note,\n\n00:12:55.954 --> 00:12:58.699\nis a visual tool to help communicate\n\n00:12:58.723 --> 00:13:01.424\nacross cultures and sign languages\naround the world.\n\n00:13:01.955 --> 00:13:04.241\nThe second one I'd like\nto demonstrate is this --\n\n00:13:04.265 --> 00:13:06.001\nplease follow along with me again.\n\n00:13:10.849 --> 00:13:11.999\nAnd now this.\n\n00:13:17.316 --> 00:13:20.016\nThis is \"colonization\" in ASL.\n\n00:13:20.040 --> 00:13:21.444\n(Laughter)\n\n00:13:23.365 --> 00:13:24.636\nNow the third --\n\n00:13:24.660 --> 00:13:26.054\nplease follow along again.\n\n00:13:31.030 --> 00:13:32.180\nAnd again.\n\n00:13:36.928 --> 00:13:39.436\nThis is \"enlightenment\" in ASL.\n\n00:13:39.460 --> 00:13:41.021\nSo let's do all three together.\n\n00:13:43.690 --> 00:13:44.847\n\"Fall in love,\"\n\n00:13:45.855 --> 00:13:47.024\n\"colonization\"\n\n00:13:47.803 --> 00:13:48.953\nand \"enlightenment.\"\n\n00:13:50.725 --> 00:13:51.875\nGood job, everyone.\n\n00:13:51.899 --> 00:13:53.117\n(Laughter)\n\n00:13:53.141 --> 00:13:55.379\nNotice how all three signs\nare very similar,\n\n00:13:55.403 --> 00:13:57.500\nthey all happen at the head and the chest,\n\n00:13:57.524 --> 00:13:59.746\nbut they convey quite different meanings.\n\n00:13:59.770 --> 00:14:03.094\nSo it's amazing to see\nhow ASL is alive and thriving,\n\n00:14:03.118 --> 00:14:04.417\njust like music is.\n\n00:14:06.110 --> 00:14:08.936\nHowever, in this day and age,\n\n00:14:08.960 --> 00:14:11.562\nwe live in a very audio-centric world.\n\n00:14:11.586 --> 00:14:14.967\nAnd just because ASL has no sound to it,\n\n00:14:14.991 --> 00:14:17.901\nit automatically holds no social currency.\n\n00:14:19.229 --> 00:14:23.967\nWe need to start thinking harder\nabout what defines social currency\n\n00:14:23.991 --> 00:14:27.833\nand allow ASL to develop\nits own form of currency --\n\n00:14:27.857 --> 00:14:29.022\nwithout sound.\n\n00:14:30.220 --> 00:14:34.908\nAnd this could possibly be a step\nto lead to a more inclusive society.\n\n00:14:38.249 --> 00:14:40.381\nAnd maybe people will understand\n\n00:14:40.405 --> 00:14:43.941\nthat you don't need\nto be deaf to learn ASL,\n\n00:14:43.965 --> 00:14:46.252\nnor do you have to be hearing\nto learn music.\n\n00:14:48.849 --> 00:14:51.544\nASL is such a rich treasure\n\n00:14:51.568 --> 00:14:54.353\nthat I'd like you\nto have the same experience.\n\n00:14:54.377 --> 00:14:57.153\nAnd I'd like to invite you\nto open your ears,\n\n00:14:57.177 --> 00:14:59.068\nto open your eyes,\n\n00:14:59.092 --> 00:15:00.803\ntake part in our culture\n\n00:15:00.827 --> 00:15:03.346\nand experience our visual language.\n\n00:15:03.370 --> 00:15:04.805\nAnd you never know,\n\n00:15:04.829 --> 00:15:06.569\nyou might just fall in love with us.\n\n00:15:06.593 --> 00:15:08.651\n(Applause)\n\n00:15:08.675 --> 00:15:09.837\nThank you.\n\n00:15:10.466 --> 00:15:12.367\nDenise Kahler-Braaten: Hey, that's me.\n\n00:15:12.391 --> 00:15:15.789\n(Applause)"}, {"title": "Art that lets you talk back to NSA spies", "duration": "776", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/mathias_jud_art_that_lets_you_talk_back_to_nsa_spies", "transcript": "A year ago, we were invited by the Swiss Embassy in Berlin to present our art projects. We are used to invitations, but this invitation really thrilled us. The Swiss Embassy in Berlin is special. It is the only old building in the government district that was not destroyed during the Second World War, and it sits right next to the Federal Chancellery. No one is closer to Chancellor Merkel than the Swiss diplomats.(Laughter)The government district in Berlin also contains the Reichstag \u2014 Germany's parliament \u2014 and the Brandenburg Gate, and right next to the gate there are other embassies, in particular the US and the British Embassy.Although Germany is an advanced democracy, citizens are limited in their constitutional rights in its government district. The right of assembly and the right to demonstrate are restricted there. And this is interesting from an artistic point of view. The opportunities to exercise participation and to express oneself are always bound to a certain order and always subject to a specific regulation. With an awareness of the dependencies of these regulations, we can gain a new perspective. The given terms and conditions shape our perception, our actions and our lives.And this is crucial in another context. Over the last couple of years, we learned that from the roofs of the US and the British Embassy, the secret services have been listening to the entire district, including the mobile phone of Angela Merkel. The antennas of the British GCHQ are hidden in a white cylindrical radome, while the listening post of the American NSA is covered by radio transparent screens.But how to address these hidden and disguised forces? With my colleague, Christoph Wachter, we accepted the invitation of the Swiss Embassy. And we used this opportunity to exploit the specific situation.If people are spying on us, it stands to reason that they have to listen to what we are saying.(Laughter)On the roof of the Swiss Embassy, we installed a series of antennas. They weren't as sophisticated as those used by the Americans and the British.(Laughter)They were makeshift can antennas, not camouflaged but totally obvious and visible. The Academy of Arts joined the project, and so we built another large antenna on their rooftop, exactly between the listening posts of the NSA and the GCHQ.(Laughter)Never have we been observed in such detail while building an art installation. A helicopter circled over our heads with a camera registering each and every move we made, and on the roof of the US Embassy, security officers patrolled. Although the government district is governed by a strict police order, there are no specific laws relating to digital communication. Our installation was therefore perfectly legal, and the Swiss Ambassador informed Chancellor Merkel about it. We named the project \"Can You Hear Me?\"(Laughter)The antennas created an open and free Wi-Fi communication network in which anyone who wanted to would be able to participate using any Wi-Fi-enabled device without any hindrance, and be able to send messages to those listening on the frequencies that were being intercepted. Text messages, voice chat, file sharing \u2014 anything could be sent anonymously. And people did communicate. Over 15,000 messages were sent. Here are some examples.\"Hello world, hello Berlin, hello NSA, hello GCHQ.\"\"NSA Agents, Do the Right Thing! Blow the whistle!\"\"This is the NSA. In God we trust. All others we track!!!!!\"(Laughter)\"#@nonymous is watching #NSA #GCHQ - we are part of your organizations. # expect us. We will #shutdown\"\"This is the NSA's Achilles heel. Open Networks.\"\"Agents, what twisted story of yourself will you tell your grandchildren?\"\"@NSA My neighbors are noisy. Please send a drone strike.\"(Laughter)\"Make Love, Not cyberwar.\"We invited the embassies and the government departments to participate in the open network, too, and to our surprise, they did. Files appeared on the network, including classified documents leaked from the parliamentary investigation commission, which highlights that the free exchange and discussion of vital information is starting to become difficult, even for members of a parliament. We also organized guided tours to experience and sound out the power constellations on-site. The tours visited the restricted zones around the embassies, and we discussed the potential and the highlights of communication.If we become aware of the constellation, the terms and conditions of communication, it not only broadens our horizon, it allows us to look behind the regulations that limit our worldview, our specific social, political or aesthetic conventions.Let's look at an actual example. The fate of people living in the makeshift settlements on the outskirts of Paris is hidden and faded from view. It's a vicious circle. It's not poverty, not racism, not exclusion that are new. What is new is how these realities are hidden and how people are made invisible in an age of global and overwhelming communication and exchange. Such makeshift settlements are considered illegal, and therefore those living in them don't have a chance of making their voices heard. On the contrary, every time they appear, every time they risk becoming visible, merely gives grounds for further persecution, expulsion and suppression. What interested us was how we could come to know this hidden side. We were searching for an interface and we found one. It's not a digital interface, but a physical one: it's a hotel.We named the project \"Hotel Gelem.\" Together with Roma families, we created several Hotel Gelems in Europe, for example, in Freiburg in Germany, in Montreuil near Paris, and also in the Balkans. These are real hotels. People can stay there. But they aren't a commercial enterprise. They are a symbol. You can go online and ask for a personal invitation to come and live for a few days in the Hotel Gelem, in their homes, eating, working and living with the Roma families. Here, the Roma families are not the travelers; the visitors are. Here, the Roma families are not a minority; the visitors are.The point is not to make judgments, but rather to find out about the context that determines these disparate and seemingly insurmountable contradictions. In the world of globalization, the continents are drifting closer to each other. Cultures, goods and people are in permanent exchange, but at the same time, the gap between the world of the privileged and the world of the excluded is growing.We were recently in Australia. For us, it was no problem to enter the country. We have European passports, visas and air tickets. But asylum seekers who arrive by boat in Australia are deported or taken to prison. The interception of the boats and the disappearance of the people into the detention system are veiled by the Australian authorities. These procedures are declared to be secret military operations. After dramatic escapes from crisis zones and war zones, men, women and children are detained by Australia without trial, sometimes for years.During our stay, however, we managed to reach out and work with asylum seekers who were imprisoned, despite strict screening and isolation. From these contexts was born an installation in the art space of the Queensland University of Technology in Brisbane.On the face of it, it was a very simple installation. On the floor, a stylized compass gave the direction to each immigration detention center, accompanied by the distance and the name of the immigration facility. But the exhibition step came in the form of connectivity. Above every floor marking, there was a headset. Visitors were offered the opportunity to talk directly to a refugee who was or had been imprisoned in a specific detention facility and engage in a personal conversation. In the protected context of the art exhibition, asylum seekers felt free to talk about themselves, their story and their situation, without fear of consequences. Visitors immersed themselves in long conversations about families torn apart, about dramatic escapes from war zones, about suicide attempts, about the fate of children in detention. Emotions ran deep. Many wept. Several revisited the exhibition. It was a powerful experience.Europe is now facing a stream of migrants. The situation for the asylum seekers is made worse by contradictory policies and the temptation of militarized responses. We have also established communication systems in remote refugee centers in Switzerland and Greece. They are all about providing basic information \u2014 weather forecasts, legal information, guidance. But they are significant. Information on the Internet that could ensure survival along dangerous routes is being censored, and the provision of such information is becoming increasingly criminalized.This brings us back to our network and to the antennas on the roof of the Swiss Embassy in Berlin and the \"Can You Hear Me?\" project. We should not take it for granted to be boundlessly connected. We should start making our own connections, fighting for this idea of an equal and globally interconnected world. This is essential to overcome our speechlessness and the separation provoked by rival political forces. It is only in truly exposing ourselves to the transformative power of this experience that we can overcome prejudice and exclusion.Thank you.(Applause)Bruno Giussani: Thank you, Mathias. The other half of your artistic duo is also here. Christoph Wachter, come onstage.(Applause)First, tell me just a detail: the name of the hotel is not a random name. Gelem means something specific in the Roma language.Mathias Jud: Yes, \"Gelem, Gelem\" is the title of the Romani hymn, the official, and it means \"I went a long way.\"BG: That's just to add the detail to your talk. But you two traveled to the island of Lesbos very recently, you're just back a couple of days ago, in Greece, where thousands of refugees are arriving and have been arriving over the last few months. What did you see there and what did you do there?Christoph Wachter: Well, Lesbos is one of the Greek islands close to Turkey, and during our stay, many asylum seekers arrived by boat on overcrowded dinghies, and after landing, they were left completely on their own. They are denied many services. For example, they are not allowed to buy a bus ticket or to rent a hotel room, so many families literally sleep in the streets. And we installed networks there to allow basic communication, because I think, I believe, it's not only that we have to speak about the refugees, I think we need to start talking to them. And by doing so, we can realize that it is about human beings, about their lives and their struggle to survive.BG: And allow them to talk as well. Christoph, thank you for coming to TED. Mathias, thank you for coming to TED and sharing your story.(Applause)", "id": 2365, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:12.957 --> 00:00:16.299\nA year ago, we were invited\nby the Swiss Embassy in Berlin\n\n00:00:16.323 --> 00:00:18.346\nto present our art projects.\n\n00:00:18.957 --> 00:00:23.091\nWe are used to invitations,\nbut this invitation really thrilled us.\n\n00:00:23.544 --> 00:00:26.385\nThe Swiss Embassy in Berlin is special.\n\n00:00:26.409 --> 00:00:29.377\nIt is the only old building\nin the government district\n\n00:00:29.401 --> 00:00:32.357\nthat was not destroyed\nduring the Second World War,\n\n00:00:32.381 --> 00:00:35.149\nand it sits right next\nto the Federal Chancellery.\n\n00:00:35.681 --> 00:00:39.797\nNo one is closer to Chancellor Merkel\nthan the Swiss diplomats.\n\n00:00:39.821 --> 00:00:41.797\n(Laughter)\n\n00:00:42.614 --> 00:00:46.433\nThe government district in Berlin\nalso contains the Reichstag --\n\n00:00:46.457 --> 00:00:49.268\nGermany's parliament --\nand the Brandenburg Gate,\n\n00:00:49.292 --> 00:00:52.233\nand right next to the gate\nthere are other embassies,\n\n00:00:52.257 --> 00:00:55.654\nin particular the US\nand the British Embassy.\n\n00:00:56.615 --> 00:00:59.831\nAlthough Germany is an advanced democracy,\n\n00:00:59.855 --> 00:01:02.816\ncitizens are limited\nin their constitutional rights\n\n00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:04.233\nin its government district.\n\n00:01:04.257 --> 00:01:08.644\nThe right of assembly and the right\nto demonstrate are restricted there.\n\n00:01:09.565 --> 00:01:13.233\nAnd this is interesting\nfrom an artistic point of view.\n\n00:01:13.257 --> 00:01:17.969\nThe opportunities to exercise\nparticipation and to express oneself\n\n00:01:17.993 --> 00:01:20.233\nare always bound to a certain order\n\n00:01:20.257 --> 00:01:23.732\nand always subject\nto a specific regulation.\n\n00:01:23.756 --> 00:01:28.515\nWith an awareness of the dependencies\nof these regulations,\n\n00:01:28.539 --> 00:01:31.233\nwe can gain a new perspective.\n\n00:01:31.257 --> 00:01:35.911\nThe given terms and conditions\nshape our perception, our actions\n\n00:01:35.935 --> 00:01:37.522\nand our lives.\n\n00:01:38.126 --> 00:01:41.233\nAnd this is crucial in another context.\n\n00:01:41.257 --> 00:01:42.735\nOver the last couple of years,\n\n00:01:42.759 --> 00:01:47.233\nwe learned that from the roofs\nof the US and the British Embassy,\n\n00:01:47.257 --> 00:01:51.994\nthe secret services have been listening\nto the entire district,\n\n00:01:52.018 --> 00:01:54.714\nincluding the mobile phone\nof Angela Merkel.\n\n00:01:55.257 --> 00:02:00.233\nThe antennas of the British GCHQ are\nhidden in a white cylindrical radome,\n\n00:02:00.257 --> 00:02:03.274\nwhile the listening post\nof the American NSA\n\n00:02:03.298 --> 00:02:06.257\nis covered by radio transparent screens.\n\n00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:10.233\nBut how to address these hidden\nand disguised forces?\n\n00:02:10.861 --> 00:02:13.233\nWith my colleague, Christoph Wachter,\n\n00:02:13.257 --> 00:02:15.860\nwe accepted the invitation\nof the Swiss Embassy.\n\n00:02:16.741 --> 00:02:20.844\nAnd we used this opportunity\nto exploit the specific situation.\n\n00:02:22.466 --> 00:02:25.608\nIf people are spying on us,\nit stands to reason\n\n00:02:25.632 --> 00:02:28.233\nthat they have to listen\nto what we are saying.\n\n00:02:28.257 --> 00:02:32.233\n(Laughter)\n\n00:02:32.257 --> 00:02:36.257\nOn the roof of the Swiss Embassy,\nwe installed a series of antennas.\n\n00:02:38.687 --> 00:02:42.941\nThey weren't as sophisticated as those\nused by the Americans and the British.\n\n00:02:42.965 --> 00:02:44.232\n(Laughter)\n\n00:02:44.256 --> 00:02:45.979\nThey were makeshift can antennas,\n\n00:02:46.003 --> 00:02:48.992\nnot camouflaged but totally\nobvious and visible.\n\n00:02:50.257 --> 00:02:52.752\nThe Academy of Arts joined the project,\n\n00:02:52.776 --> 00:02:56.466\nand so we built another\nlarge antenna on their rooftop,\n\n00:02:56.490 --> 00:03:00.508\nexactly between the listening posts\nof the NSA and the GCHQ.\n\n00:03:00.532 --> 00:03:02.388\n(Laughter)\n\n00:03:02.412 --> 00:03:07.233\nNever have we been observed in such detail\nwhile building an art installation.\n\n00:03:07.257 --> 00:03:09.509\nA helicopter circled over our heads\n\n00:03:09.533 --> 00:03:12.763\nwith a camera registering\neach and every move we made,\n\n00:03:12.787 --> 00:03:15.997\nand on the roof of the US Embassy,\nsecurity officers patrolled.\n\n00:03:17.457 --> 00:03:22.646\nAlthough the government district\nis governed by a strict police order,\n\n00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:26.829\nthere are no specific laws\nrelating to digital communication.\n\n00:03:27.506 --> 00:03:30.989\nOur installation\nwas therefore perfectly legal,\n\n00:03:31.013 --> 00:03:34.210\nand the Swiss Ambassador\ninformed Chancellor Merkel about it.\n\n00:03:35.059 --> 00:03:37.938\nWe named the project \"Can You Hear Me?\"\n\n00:03:37.962 --> 00:03:39.938\n(Laughter)\n\n00:03:40.763 --> 00:03:45.024\nThe antennas created an open\nand free Wi-Fi communication network\n\n00:03:45.048 --> 00:03:48.233\nin which anyone who wanted to\nwould be able to participate\n\n00:03:48.257 --> 00:03:51.369\nusing any Wi-Fi-enabled device\nwithout any hindrance,\n\n00:03:51.393 --> 00:03:53.314\nand be able to send messages\n\n00:03:53.338 --> 00:03:57.418\nto those listening on the frequencies\nthat were being intercepted.\n\n00:03:58.468 --> 00:04:00.963\nText messages, voice chat, file sharing --\n\n00:04:00.987 --> 00:04:03.636\nanything could be sent anonymously.\n\n00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:07.233\nAnd people did communicate.\n\n00:04:07.257 --> 00:04:10.233\nOver 15,000 messages were sent.\n\n00:04:10.257 --> 00:04:12.009\nHere are some examples.\n\n00:04:13.257 --> 00:04:17.769\n\"Hello world, hello Berlin,\nhello NSA, hello GCHQ.\"\n\n00:04:19.166 --> 00:04:23.257\n\"NSA Agents, Do the Right Thing!\nBlow the whistle!\"\n\n00:04:24.842 --> 00:04:28.546\n\"This is the NSA. In God we trust.\nAll others we track!!!!!\"\n\n00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:30.822\n(Laughter)\n\n00:04:32.191 --> 00:04:36.233\n\"#@nonymous is watching #NSA #GCHQ -\nwe are part of your organizations.\n\n00:04:36.257 --> 00:04:38.257\n# expect us. We will #shutdown\"\n\n00:04:39.441 --> 00:04:42.901\n\"This is the NSA's Achilles heel.\nOpen Networks.\"\n\n00:04:42.925 --> 00:04:47.663\n\"Agents, what twisted story of yourself\nwill you tell your grandchildren?\"\n\n00:04:48.412 --> 00:04:52.828\n\"@NSA My neighbors are noisy.\nPlease send a drone strike.\"\n\n00:04:52.852 --> 00:04:55.304\n(Laughter)\n\n00:04:56.487 --> 00:04:58.798\n\"Make Love, Not cyberwar.\"\n\n00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:02.233\nWe invited the embassies\nand the government departments\n\n00:05:02.257 --> 00:05:05.063\nto participate in the open network, too,\n\n00:05:05.087 --> 00:05:07.000\nand to our surprise, they did.\n\n00:05:07.024 --> 00:05:09.944\nFiles appeared on the network,\nincluding classified documents\n\n00:05:09.968 --> 00:05:12.586\nleaked from the parliamentary\ninvestigation commission,\n\n00:05:12.610 --> 00:05:16.300\nwhich highlights that the free exchange\nand discussion of vital information\n\n00:05:16.324 --> 00:05:20.664\nis starting to become difficult,\neven for members of a parliament.\n\n00:05:21.704 --> 00:05:25.026\nWe also organized guided tours\nto experience and sound out\n\n00:05:25.050 --> 00:05:27.100\nthe power constellations on-site.\n\n00:05:27.124 --> 00:05:30.461\nThe tours visited the restricted zones\naround the embassies,\n\n00:05:30.485 --> 00:05:34.884\nand we discussed the potential\nand the highlights of communication.\n\n00:05:36.257 --> 00:05:40.436\nIf we become aware of the constellation,\n\n00:05:40.460 --> 00:05:43.256\nthe terms and conditions of communication,\n\n00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:45.611\nit not only broadens our horizon,\n\n00:05:45.635 --> 00:05:49.507\nit allows us to look behind\nthe regulations that limit our worldview,\n\n00:05:49.531 --> 00:05:53.657\nour specific social, political\nor aesthetic conventions.\n\n00:05:54.419 --> 00:05:56.372\nLet's look at an actual example.\n\n00:05:57.341 --> 00:06:00.428\nThe fate of people living\nin the makeshift settlements\n\n00:06:00.452 --> 00:06:02.179\non the outskirts of Paris\n\n00:06:02.203 --> 00:06:04.367\nis hidden and faded from view.\n\n00:06:05.257 --> 00:06:06.716\nIt's a vicious circle.\n\n00:06:07.257 --> 00:06:10.509\nIt's not poverty, not racism,\nnot exclusion that are new.\n\n00:06:10.533 --> 00:06:14.051\nWhat is new is how\nthese realities are hidden\n\n00:06:14.075 --> 00:06:15.703\nand how people are made invisible\n\n00:06:15.727 --> 00:06:19.823\nin an age of global and overwhelming\ncommunication and exchange.\n\n00:06:20.553 --> 00:06:23.388\nSuch makeshift settlements\nare considered illegal,\n\n00:06:23.412 --> 00:06:26.684\nand therefore those living in them\ndon't have a chance\n\n00:06:26.708 --> 00:06:28.509\nof making their voices heard.\n\n00:06:28.533 --> 00:06:33.959\nOn the contrary, every time they appear,\nevery time they risk becoming visible,\n\n00:06:33.983 --> 00:06:36.693\nmerely gives grounds\nfor further persecution,\n\n00:06:36.717 --> 00:06:38.726\nexpulsion and suppression.\n\n00:06:38.750 --> 00:06:43.954\nWhat interested us was how we could\ncome to know this hidden side.\n\n00:06:43.978 --> 00:06:47.367\nWe were searching for an interface\nand we found one.\n\n00:06:47.391 --> 00:06:51.654\nIt's not a digital interface,\nbut a physical one: it's a hotel.\n\n00:06:51.678 --> 00:06:54.193\nWe named the project \"Hotel Gelem.\"\n\n00:06:54.741 --> 00:06:58.574\nTogether with Roma families,\nwe created several Hotel Gelems in Europe,\n\n00:06:58.598 --> 00:07:01.557\nfor example, in Freiburg in Germany,\nin Montreuil near Paris,\n\n00:07:01.581 --> 00:07:03.233\nand also in the Balkans.\n\n00:07:03.257 --> 00:07:04.618\nThese are real hotels.\n\n00:07:04.642 --> 00:07:06.233\nPeople can stay there.\n\n00:07:06.257 --> 00:07:08.233\nBut they aren't a commercial enterprise.\n\n00:07:08.257 --> 00:07:09.739\nThey are a symbol.\n\n00:07:10.533 --> 00:07:14.185\nYou can go online and ask\nfor a personal invitation\n\n00:07:14.209 --> 00:07:18.595\nto come and live for a few days\nin the Hotel Gelem, in their homes,\n\n00:07:18.619 --> 00:07:22.111\neating, working and living\nwith the Roma families.\n\n00:07:22.706 --> 00:07:25.873\nHere, the Roma families\nare not the travelers;\n\n00:07:25.897 --> 00:07:27.192\nthe visitors are.\n\n00:07:27.542 --> 00:07:30.597\nHere, the Roma families\nare not a minority;\n\n00:07:30.621 --> 00:07:31.915\nthe visitors are.\n\n00:07:33.791 --> 00:07:37.760\nThe point is not to make judgments,\n\n00:07:37.784 --> 00:07:40.538\nbut rather to find out\nabout the context that determines\n\n00:07:40.562 --> 00:07:43.761\nthese disparate and seemingly\ninsurmountable contradictions.\n\n00:07:44.257 --> 00:07:46.497\nIn the world of globalization,\n\n00:07:46.521 --> 00:07:49.233\nthe continents are drifting\ncloser to each other.\n\n00:07:49.257 --> 00:07:51.781\nCultures, goods and people\nare in permanent exchange,\n\n00:07:51.805 --> 00:07:55.059\nbut at the same time, the gap\nbetween the world of the privileged\n\n00:07:55.083 --> 00:07:57.931\nand the world of the excluded is growing.\n\n00:07:59.549 --> 00:08:01.233\nWe were recently in Australia.\n\n00:08:01.257 --> 00:08:03.858\nFor us, it was no problem\nto enter the country.\n\n00:08:03.882 --> 00:08:06.564\nWe have European passports,\nvisas and air tickets.\n\n00:08:07.017 --> 00:08:10.719\nBut asylum seekers who arrive\nby boat in Australia\n\n00:08:10.743 --> 00:08:12.779\nare deported or taken to prison.\n\n00:08:13.257 --> 00:08:14.732\nThe interception of the boats\n\n00:08:14.756 --> 00:08:17.837\nand the disappearance of the people\ninto the detention system\n\n00:08:17.861 --> 00:08:20.504\nare veiled by the Australian authorities.\n\n00:08:21.020 --> 00:08:24.964\nThese procedures are declared\nto be secret military operations.\n\n00:08:25.726 --> 00:08:28.870\nAfter dramatic escapes\nfrom crisis zones and war zones,\n\n00:08:28.894 --> 00:08:33.005\nmen, women and children\nare detained by Australia without trial,\n\n00:08:33.029 --> 00:08:35.002\nsometimes for years.\n\n00:08:36.994 --> 00:08:39.090\nDuring our stay, however,\n\n00:08:39.114 --> 00:08:43.233\nwe managed to reach out and work\nwith asylum seekers who were imprisoned,\n\n00:08:43.257 --> 00:08:45.459\ndespite strict screening and isolation.\n\n00:08:46.015 --> 00:08:50.124\nFrom these contexts was born\nan installation in the art space\n\n00:08:50.148 --> 00:08:53.233\nof the Queensland University\nof Technology in Brisbane.\n\n00:08:54.593 --> 00:08:57.648\nOn the face of it,\nit was a very simple installation.\n\n00:08:58.140 --> 00:09:01.545\nOn the floor, a stylized compass\ngave the direction\n\n00:09:01.569 --> 00:09:03.577\nto each immigration detention center,\n\n00:09:03.601 --> 00:09:08.233\naccompanied by the distance\nand the name of the immigration facility.\n\n00:09:08.257 --> 00:09:12.233\nBut the exhibition step\ncame in the form of connectivity.\n\n00:09:12.600 --> 00:09:16.233\nAbove every floor marking,\nthere was a headset.\n\n00:09:16.257 --> 00:09:20.873\nVisitors were offered the opportunity\nto talk directly to a refugee\n\n00:09:20.897 --> 00:09:23.233\nwho was or had been imprisoned\n\n00:09:23.257 --> 00:09:25.445\nin a specific detention facility\n\n00:09:25.469 --> 00:09:27.890\nand engage in a personal conversation.\n\n00:09:28.874 --> 00:09:31.740\nIn the protected context\nof the art exhibition,\n\n00:09:31.764 --> 00:09:34.391\nasylum seekers felt free\nto talk about themselves,\n\n00:09:34.415 --> 00:09:38.105\ntheir story and their situation,\nwithout fear of consequences.\n\n00:09:38.652 --> 00:09:41.664\nVisitors immersed themselves\nin long conversations\n\n00:09:41.688 --> 00:09:45.441\nabout families torn apart,\nabout dramatic escapes from war zones,\n\n00:09:45.465 --> 00:09:47.077\nabout suicide attempts,\n\n00:09:47.101 --> 00:09:49.711\nabout the fate of children in detention.\n\n00:09:50.576 --> 00:09:52.560\nEmotions ran deep. Many wept.\n\n00:09:52.584 --> 00:09:54.966\nSeveral revisited the exhibition.\n\n00:09:54.990 --> 00:09:57.330\nIt was a powerful experience.\n\n00:09:58.417 --> 00:10:02.689\nEurope is now facing a stream of migrants.\n\n00:10:03.371 --> 00:10:07.233\nThe situation for the asylum seekers\nis made worse by contradictory policies\n\n00:10:07.257 --> 00:10:10.552\nand the temptation\nof militarized responses.\n\n00:10:11.257 --> 00:10:13.947\nWe have also established\ncommunication systems\n\n00:10:13.971 --> 00:10:17.039\nin remote refugee centers\nin Switzerland and Greece.\n\n00:10:17.580 --> 00:10:20.811\nThey are all about providing\nbasic information -- weather forecasts,\n\n00:10:20.835 --> 00:10:22.709\nlegal information, guidance.\n\n00:10:23.121 --> 00:10:24.812\nBut they are significant.\n\n00:10:25.169 --> 00:10:26.487\nInformation on the Internet\n\n00:10:26.511 --> 00:10:29.241\nthat could ensure survival\nalong dangerous routes\n\n00:10:29.265 --> 00:10:30.658\nis being censored,\n\n00:10:30.682 --> 00:10:35.369\nand the provision of such information\nis becoming increasingly criminalized.\n\n00:10:36.559 --> 00:10:39.609\nThis brings us back to our

00:12:08.479\nmany asylum seekers arrived by boat\non overcrowded dinghies,\n\n00:12:08.503 --> 00:12:12.162\nand after landing, they were left\ncompletely on their own.\n\n00:12:12.186 --> 00:12:15.977\nThey are denied many services.\n\n00:12:16.001 --> 00:12:18.495\nFor example, they are not allowed\nto buy a bus ticket\n\n00:12:18.519 --> 00:12:19.924\nor to rent a hotel

00:12:40.233\nI think we need to start talking to them.\n\n00:12:40.613 --> 00:12:44.233\nAnd by doing so, we can realize\nthat it is about human beings,\n\n00:12:44.257 --> 00:12:47.020\nabout their

I had just driven home, it was around midnight in the dead of Montreal winter, I had been visiting my friend, Jeff, across town, and the thermometer on the front porch read minus 40 degrees \u2014 and don't bother asking if that's Celsius or Fahrenheit, minus 40 is where the two scales meet \u2014 it was very cold. And as I stood on the front porch fumbling in my pockets, I found I didn't have my keys. In fact, I could see them through the window, lying on the dining room table where I had left them. So I quickly ran around and tried all the other doors and windows, and they were locked tight. I thought about calling a locksmith \u2014 at least I had my cellphone, but at midnight, it could take a while for a locksmith to show up, and it was cold. I couldn't go back to my friend Jeff's house for the night because I had an early flight to Europe the next morning, and I needed to get my passport and my suitcase.So, desperate and freezing cold, I found a large rock and I broke through the basement window, cleared out the shards of glass, I crawled through, I found a piece of cardboard and taped it up over the opening, figuring that in the morning, on the way to the airport, I could call my contractor and ask him to fix it. This was going to be expensive, but probably no more expensive than a middle-of-the-night locksmith, so I figured, under the circumstances, I was coming out even.Now, I'm a neuroscientist by training and I know a little bit about how the brain performs under stress. It releases cortisol that raises your heart rate, it modulates adrenaline levels and it clouds your thinking. So the next morning, when I woke up on too little sleep, worrying about the hole in the window, and a mental note that I had to call my contractor, and the freezing temperatures, and the meetings I had upcoming in Europe, and, you know, with all the cortisol in my brain, my thinking was cloudy, but I didn't know it was cloudy because my thinking was cloudy.(Laughter)And it wasn't until I got to the airport check-in counter, that I realized I didn't have my passport.(Laughter)So I raced home in the snow and ice, 40 minutes, got my passport, raced back to the airport, I made it just in time, but they had given away my seat to someone else, so I got stuck in the back of the plane, next to the bathrooms, in a seat that wouldn't recline, on an eight-hour flight. Well, I had a lot of time to think during those eight hours and no sleep.(Laughter)And I started wondering, are there things that I can do, systems that I can put into place, that will prevent bad things from happening? Or at least if bad things happen, will minimize the likelihood of it being a total catastrophe. So I started thinking about that, but my thoughts didn't crystallize until about a month later. I was having dinner with my colleague, Danny Kahneman, the Nobel Prize winner, and I somewhat embarrassedly told him about having broken my window, and, you know, forgotten my passport, and Danny shared with me that he'd been practicing something called prospective hindsight.(Laughter)It's something that he had gotten from the psychologist Gary Klein, who had written about it a few years before, also called the pre-mortem. Now, you all know what the postmortem is. Whenever there's a disaster, a team of experts come in and they try to figure out what went wrong, right? Well, in the pre-mortem, Danny explained, you look ahead and you try to figure out all the things that could go wrong, and then you try to figure out what you can do to prevent those things from happening, or to minimize the damage.So what I want to talk to you about today are some of the things we can do in the form of a pre-mortem. Some of them are obvious, some of them are not so obvious. I'll start with the obvious ones.Around the home, designate a place for things that are easily lost. Now, this sounds like common sense, and it is, but there's a lot of science to back this up, based on the way our spatial memory works. There's a structure in the brain called the hippocampus, that evolved over tens of thousands of years, to keep track of the locations of important things \u2014 where the well is, where fish can be found, that stand of fruit trees, where the friendly and enemy tribes live. The hippocampus is the part of the brain that in London taxicab drivers becomes enlarged. It's the part of the brain that allows squirrels to find their nuts. And if you're wondering, somebody actually did the experiment where they cut off the olfactory sense of the squirrels, and they could still find their nuts. They weren't using smell, they were using the hippocampus, this exquisitely evolved mechanism in the brain for finding things. But it's really good for things that don't move around much, not so good for things that move around. So this is why we lose car keys and reading glasses and passports. So in the home, designate a spot for your keys \u2014 a hook by the door, maybe a decorative bowl. For your passport, a particular drawer. For your reading glasses, a particular table. If you designate a spot and you're scrupulous about it, your things will always be there when you look for them.What about travel? Take a cell phone picture of your credit cards, your driver's license, your passport, mail it to yourself so it's in the cloud. If these things are lost or stolen, you can facilitate replacement.Now these are some rather obvious things. Remember, when you're under stress, the brain releases cortisol. Cortisol is toxic, and it causes cloudy thinking. So part of the practice of the pre-mortem is to recognize that under stress you're not going to be at your best, and you should put systems in place.And there's perhaps no more stressful a situation than when you're confronted with a medical decision to make. And at some point, all of us are going to be in that position, where we have to make a very important decision about the future of our medical care or that of a loved one, to help them with a decision.And so I want to talk about that. And I'm going to talk about a very particular medical condition. But this stands as a proxy for all kinds of medical decision-making, and indeed for financial decision-making, and social decision-making \u2014 any kind of decision you have to make that would benefit from a rational assessment of the facts.So suppose you go to your doctor and the doctor says, \"I just got your lab work back, your cholesterol's a little high.\" Now, you all know that high cholesterol is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease, heart attack, stroke. And so you're thinking having high cholesterol isn't the best thing, and so the doctor says, \"You know, I'd like to give you a drug that will help you lower your cholesterol, a statin.\" And you've probably heard of statins, you know that they're among the most widely prescribed drugs in the world today, you probably even know people who take them. And so you're thinking, \"Yeah! Give me the statin.\"But there's a question you should ask at this point, a statistic you should ask for that most doctors don't like talking about, and pharmaceutical companies like talking about even less. It's for the number needed to treat. Now, what is this, the NNT? It's the number of people that need to take a drug or undergo a surgery or any medical procedure before one person is helped. And you're thinking, what kind of crazy statistic is that? The number should be one. My doctor wouldn't prescribe something to me if it's not going to help. But actually, medical practice doesn't work that way. And it's not the doctor's fault, if it's anybody's fault, it's the fault of scientists like me. We haven't figured out the underlying mechanisms well enough. But GlaxoSmithKline estimates that 90 percent of the drugs work in only 30 to 50 percent of the people. So the number needed to treat for the most widely prescribed statin, what do you suppose it is? How many people have to take it before one person is helped? 300. This is according to research by research practitioners Jerome Groopman and Pamela Hartzband, independently confirmed by Bloomberg.com. I ran through the numbers myself. 300 people have to take the drug for a year before one heart attack, stroke or other adverse event is prevented.Now you're probably thinking, \"Well, OK, one in 300 chance of lowering my cholesterol. Why not, doc? Give me the prescription anyway.\" But you should ask at this point for another statistic, and that is, \"Tell me about the side effects.\" Right? So for this particular drug, the side effects occur in five percent of the patients. And they include terrible things \u2014 debilitating muscle and joint pain, gastrointestinal distress \u2014 but now you're thinking, \"Five percent, not very likely it's going to happen to me, I'll still take the drug.\" But wait a minute. Remember under stress you're not thinking clearly. So think about how you're going to work through this ahead of time, so you don't have to manufacture the chain of reasoning on the spot. 300 people take the drug, right? One person's helped, five percent of those 300 have side effects, that's 15 people. You're 15 times more likely to be harmed by the drug than you are to be helped by the drug.Now, I'm not saying whether you should take the statin or not. I'm just saying you should have this conversation with your doctor. Medical ethics requires it, it's part of the principle of informed consent. You have the right to have access to this kind of information to begin the conversation about whether you want to take the risks or not.Now you might be thinking I've pulled this number out of the air for shock value, but in fact it's rather typical, this number needed to treat. For the most widely performed surgery on men over the age of 50, removal of the prostate for cancer, the number needed to treat is 49. That's right, 49 surgeries are done for every one person who's helped. And the side effects in that case occur in 50 percent of the patients. They include impotence, erectile dysfunction, urinary incontinence, rectal tearing, fecal incontinence. And if you're lucky, and you're one of the 50 percent who has these, they'll only last for a year or two.So the idea of the pre-mortem is to think ahead of time to the questions that you might be able to ask that will push the conversation forward. You don't want to have to manufacture all of this on the spot. And you also want to think about things like quality of life. Because you have a choice oftentimes, do you I want a shorter life that's pain-free, or a longer life that might have a great deal of pain towards the end? These are things to talk about and think about now, with your family and your loved ones. You might change your mind in the heat of the moment, but at least you're practiced with this kind of thinking.Remember, our brain under stress releases cortisol, and one of the things that happens at that moment is a whole bunch on systems shut down. There's an evolutionary reason for this. Face-to-face with a predator, you don't need your digestive system, or your libido, or your immune system, because if you're body is expending metabolism on those things and you don't react quickly, you might become the lion's lunch, and then none of those things matter. Unfortunately, one of the things that goes out the window during those times of stress is rational, logical thinking, as Danny Kahneman and his colleagues have shown. So we need to train ourselves to think ahead to these kinds of situations.I think the important point here is recognizing that all of us are flawed. We all are going to fail now and then. The idea is to think ahead to what those failures might be, to put systems in place that will help minimize the damage, or to prevent the bad things from happening in the first place.Getting back to that snowy night in Montreal, when I got back from my trip, I had my contractor install a combination lock next to the door, with a key to the front door in it, an easy to remember combination. And I have to admit, I still have piles of mail that haven't been sorted, and piles of emails that I haven't gone through. So I'm not completely organized, but I see organization as a gradual process, and I'm getting there.Thank you very much.(Applause)", "id": 2361, "subtitle":

pre-mortem.\n\n00:03:28.238 --> 00:03:30.191\nNow, you all know what the postmortem is.\n\n00:03:30.215 --> 00:03:31.694\nWhenever there's a disaster,\n\n00:03:31.718 --> 00:03:36.014\na team of experts come in and they try\nto figure out what went wrong, right?\n\n00:03:36.038 --> 00:03:38.454\nWell, in the pre-mortem, Danny explained,\n\n00:03:38.478 --> 00:03:42.374\nyou look ahead and you try to figure out\nall the things that could go wrong,\n\n00:03:42.398 --> 00:03:44.974\nand then you try to figure out\nwhat you can do\n\n00:03:44.998 --> 00:03:48.494\nto prevent those things from happening,\nor to minimize the damage.\n\n00:03:48.518 --> 00:03:51.454\nSo what I want to talk to you about today\n\n00:03:51.478 --> 00:03:55.014\nare some of the things we can do\nin the form of a pre-mortem.\n\n00:03:55.038 --> 00:03:57.934\nSome of them are obvious,\nsome of them are not so obvious.\n\n00:03:57.958 --> 00:03:59.894\nI'll start with the obvious ones.\n\n00:03:59.918 --> 00:04:04.998\nAround the home, designate a place\nfor things that are easily lost.\n\n00:04:05.638 --> 00:04:09.494\nNow, this sounds\nlike common sense, and it is,\n\n00:04:09.518 --> 00:04:12.054\nbut there's a lot of science\nto back this up,\n\n00:04:12.078 --> 00:04:15.374\nbased on the way our spatial memory works.\n\n00:04:15.398 --> 00:04:18.254\nThere's a structure in the brain\ncalled the hippocampus,\n\n00:04:18.278 --> 00:04:21.214\nthat evolved over tens\nof thousands of years,\n\n00:04:21.238 --> 00:04:25.014\nto keep track of the locations\nof important things --\n\n00:04:25.038 --> 00:04:27.454\nwhere the well is,\nwhere fish can be found,\n\n00:04:27.478 --> 00:04:29.974\nthat stand of fruit trees,\n\n00:04:29.998 --> 00:04:32.614\nwhere the friendly and enemy tribes live.\n\n00:04:32.638 --> 00:04:34.543\nThe hippocampus is the part of the brain\n\n00:04:34.567 --> 00:04:38.054\nthat in London taxicab drivers\nbecomes enlarged.\n\n00:04:38.078 --> 00:04:41.774\nIt's the part of the brain\nthat allows squirrels to find their nuts.\n\n00:04:41.798 --> 00:04:44.656\nAnd if you're wondering,\nsomebody actually did the experiment\n\n00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:47.454\nwhere they cut off\nthe olfactory sense of the squirrels,\n\n00:04:47.478 --> 00:04:49.294\nand they could still find their nuts.\n\n00:04:49.318 --> 00:04:52.134\nThey weren't using smell,\nthey were using the hippocampus,\n\n00:04:52.158 --> 00:04:57.174\nthis exquisitely evolved mechanism\nin the brain for finding things.\n\n00:04:57.198 --> 00:05:00.934\nBut it's really good for things\nthat don't move around much,\n\n00:05:00.958 --> 00:05:03.414\nnot so good for things that move around.\n\n00:05:03.438 --> 00:05:07.734\nSo this is why we lose car keys\nand reading glasses and passports.\n\n00:05:07.758 --> 00:05:10.254\nSo in the home,\ndesignate a spot for your keys --\n\n00:05:10.278 --> 00:05:13.134\na hook by the door,\nmaybe a decorative bowl.\n\n00:05:13.158 --> 00:05:15.254\nFor your passport, a particular drawer.\n\n00:05:15.278 --> 00:05:18.054\nFor your reading glasses,\na particular table.\n\n00:05:18.078 --> 00:05:21.534\nIf you designate a spot\nand you're scrupulous about it,\n\n00:05:21.558 --> 00:05:24.374\nyour things will always be there\nwhen you look for them.\n\n00:05:24.398 --> 00:05:25.614\nWhat about travel?\n\n00:05:25.638 --> 00:05:28.014\nTake a cell phone picture\nof your credit cards,\n\n00:05:28.038 --> 00:05:30.334\nyour driver's license, your passport,\n\n00:05:30.358 --> 00:05:32.614\nmail it to yourself so it's in the cloud.\n\n00:05:32.638 --> 00:05:37.014\nIf these things are lost or stolen,\nyou can facilitate replacement.\n\n00:05:37.038 --> 00:05:39.654\nNow these are some rather obvious things.\n\n00:05:39.678 --> 00:05:43.214\nRemember, when you're under stress,\nthe brain releases cortisol.\n\n00:05:43.238 --> 00:05:46.454\nCortisol is toxic,\nand it causes cloudy thinking.\n\n00:05:46.478 --> 00:05:49.014\nSo part of the practice of the pre-mortem\n\n00:05:49.038 --> 00:05:53.294\nis to recognize that under stress\nyou're not going to be at your best,\n\n00:05:53.318 --> 00:05:55.614\nand you should put systems in place.\n\n00:05:55.638 --> 00:05:58.574\nAnd there's perhaps\nno more stressful a situation\n\n00:05:58.598 --> 00:06:02.014\nthan when you're confronted\nwith a medical decision to make.\n\n00:06:02.038 --> 00:06:05.334\nAnd at some point, all of us\nare going to be in that position,\n\n00:06:05.358 --> 00:06:07.734\nwhere we have to make\na very important decision\n\n00:06:07.758 --> 00:06:11.054\nabout the future of our medical care\nor that of a loved one,\n\n00:06:11.078 --> 00:06:12.734\nto help them with a decision.\n\n00:06:12.758 --> 00:06:14.374\nAnd so I want to talk about that.\n\n00:06:14.398 --> 00:06:17.414\nAnd I'm going to talk about\na very particular medical condition.\n\n00:06:17.438 --> 00:06:20.974\nBut this stands as a proxy for all kinds\nof medical decision-making,\n\n00:06:20.998 --> 00:06:25.014\nand indeed for financial decision-making,\nand social decision-making --\n\n00:06:25.038 --> 00:06:27.294\nany kind of decision you have to make\n\n00:06:27.318 --> 00:06:31.334\nthat would benefit from a rational\nassessment of the facts.\n\n00:06:31.358 --> 00:06:34.494\nSo suppose you go to your doctor\nand the doctor says,\n\n00:06:34.518 --> 00:06:38.638\n\"I just got your lab work back,\nyour cholesterol's a little high.\"\n\n00:06:39.198 --> 00:06:42.214\nNow, you all know that high cholesterol\n\n00:06:42.238 --> 00:06:46.374\nis associated with an increased risk\nof cardiovascular disease,\n\n00:06:46.398 --> 00:06:47.814\nheart attack, stroke.\n\n00:06:47.838 --> 00:06:49.054\nAnd so you're thinking\n\n00:06:49.078 --> 00:06:51.174\nhaving high cholesterol\nisn't the best thing,\n\n00:06:51.198 --> 00:06:54.214\nand so the doctor says,\n\"You know, I'd like to give you a drug\n\n00:06:54.238 --> 00:06:57.014\nthat will help you\nlower your cholesterol, a statin.\"\n\n00:06:57.038 --> 00:06:58.934\nAnd you've probably heard of statins,\n\n00:06:58.958 --> 00:07:01.768\nyou know that they're among\nthe most widely prescribed drugs\n\n00:07:01.792 --> 00:07:02.966\nin the world today,\n\n00:07:02.990 --> 00:07:05.069\nyou probably even know\npeople who take them.\n\n00:07:05.093 --> 00:07:07.474\nAnd so you're thinking,\n\"Yeah! Give me the statin.\"\n\n00:07:07.499 --> 00:07:09.934\nBut there's a question\nyou should ask at this point,\n\n00:07:09.958 --> 00:07:11.814\na statistic you should ask for\n\n00:07:11.838 --> 00:07:14.294\nthat most doctors\ndon't like talking about,\n\n00:07:14.318 --> 00:07:17.478\nand pharmaceutical companies\nlike talking about even less.\n\n00:07:18.758 --> 00:07:21.134\nIt's for the number needed to treat.\n\n00:07:21.158 --> 00:07:23.134\nNow, what is this, the NNT?\n\n00:07:23.158 --> 00:07:26.214\nIt's the number of people\nthat need to take a drug\n\n00:07:26.238 --> 00:07:29.094\nor undergo a surgery\nor any medical procedure\n\n00:07:29.118 --> 00:07:31.494\nbefore one person is helped.\n\n00:07:31.518 --> 00:07:34.374\nAnd you're thinking,\nwhat kind of crazy statistic is that?\n\n00:07:34.398 --> 00:07:35.614\nThe number should be one.\n\n00:07:35.638 --> 00:07:37.694\nMy doctor wouldn't prescribe\nsomething to me\n\n00:07:37.718 --> 00:07:39.003\nif it's not going to help.\n\n00:07:39.027 --> 00:07:41.511\nBut actually, medical practice\ndoesn't work that way.\n\n00:07:41.536 --> 00:07:43.067\nAnd it's not the doctor's fault,\n\n00:07:43.092 --> 00:07:46.011\nif it's anybody's fault,\nit's the fault of scientists like me.\n\n00:07:46.035 --> 00:07:48.900\nWe haven't figured out\nthe underlying mechanisms well enough.\n\n00:07:48.924 --> 00:07:51.334\nBut GlaxoSmithKline estimates\n\n00:07:51.358 --> 00:07:56.334\nthat 90 percent of the drugs work\nin only 30 to 50 percent of the people.\n\n00:07:56.358 --> 00:08:00.174\nSo the number needed to treat\nfor the most widely prescribed statin,\n\n00:08:00.198 --> 00:08:02.334\nwhat do you suppose it is?\n\n00:08:02.358 --> 00:08:05.174\nHow many people have to take it\nbefore one person is helped?\n\n00:08:05.198 --> 00:08:06.398\n300.\n\n00:08:07.033 --> 00:08:08.414\nThis is according to research\n\n00:08:08.438 --> 00:08:11.934\nby research practitioners\nJerome Groopman and Pamela Hartzband,\n\n00:08:11.958 --> 00:08:14.734\nindependently confirmed by Bloomberg.com.\n\n00:08:14.758 --> 00:08:17.158\nI ran through the numbers myself.\n\n00:08:17.878 --> 00:08:20.254\n300 people have to\ntake the drug for a year\n\n00:08:20.278 --> 00:08:24.254\nbefore one heart attack, stroke\nor other adverse event is prevented.\n\n00:08:24.278 --> 00:08:25.659\nNow you're probably thinking,\n\n00:08:25.683 --> 00:08:28.494\n\"Well, OK, one in 300 chance\nof lowering my cholesterol.\n\n00:08:28.518 --> 00:08:30.734\nWhy not, doc? Give me\nthe prescription anyway.\"\n\n00:08:30.758 --> 00:08:33.614\nBut you should ask at this point\nfor another statistic,\n\n00:08:33.638 --> 00:08:36.214\nand that is, \"Tell me\nabout the side effects.\" Right?\n\n00:08:36.238 --> 00:08:37.894\nSo for this particular drug,\n\n00:08:37.918 --> 00:08:41.574\nthe side effects occur\nin five percent of the patients.\n\n00:08:41.598 --> 00:08:43.265\nAnd they include terrible things --\n\n00:08:43.289 --> 00:08:47.733\ndebilitating muscle and joint pain,\ngastrointestinal distress --\n\n00:08:47.757 --> 00:08:49.616\nbut now you're thinking, \"Five percent,\n\n00:08:49.640 --> 00:08:51.654\nnot very likely\nit's going to happen to me,\n\n00:08:51.678 --> 00:08:52.916\nI'll still take the drug.\"\n\n00:08:52.940 --> 00:08:54.134\nBut wait a minute.\n\n00:08:54.158 --> 00:08:56.494\nRemember under stress\nyou're not thinking clearly.\n\n00:08:56.518 --> 00:08:59.683\nSo think about how you're going\nto work through this ahead of time,\n\n00:08:59.708 --> 00:09:02.906\nso you don't have to manufacture\nthe chain of reasoning on the spot.\n\n00:09:02.931 --> 00:09:05.423\n300 people take the drug, right?\nOne person's helped,\n\n00:09:05.447 --> 00:09:07.854\nfive percent of those 300\nhave side effects,\n\n00:09:07.878 --> 00:09:09.358\nthat's 15 people.\n\n00:09:09.758 --> 00:09:13.654\nYou're 15 times more likely\nto be harmed by the drug\n\n00:09:13.678 --> 00:09:16.494\nthan you are to be helped by the drug.\n\n00:09:16.518 --> 00:09:19.423\nNow, I'm not saying whether you\nshould take the statin or not.\n\n00:09:19.447 --> 00:09:22.590\nI'm just saying you should have\nthis conversation with your doctor.\n\n00:09:22.614 --> 00:09:23.934\nMedical ethics requires it,\n\n00:09:23.958 --> 00:09:26.254\nit's part of the principle\nof informed consent.\n\n00:09:26.278 --> 00:09:29.494\nYou have the right to have access\nto this kind of information\n\n00:09:29.518 --> 00:09:33.414\nto begin the conversation about whether\nyou want to take the risks or not.\n\n00:09:33.438 --> 00:09:34.654\nNow you might be thinking\n\n00:09:34.678 --> 00:09:37.374\nI've pulled this number\nout of the air for shock value,\n\n00:09:37.398 --> 00:09:40.654\nbut in fact it's rather typical,\nthis number needed to treat.\n\n00:09:40.678 --> 00:09:45.294\nFor the most widely performed surgery\non men over the age of 50,\n\n00:09:45.318 --> 00:09:47.534\nremoval of the prostate for cancer,\n\n00:09:47.558 --> 00:09:50.134\nthe number needed to treat is 49.\n\n00:09:50.158 --> 00:09:54.334\nThat's right, 49 surgeries are done\nfor every one person who's helped.\n\n00:09:54.358 --> 00:09:59.014\nAnd the side effects in that case\noccur in 50 percent of the patients.\n\n00:09:59.038 --> 00:10:01.894\nThey include impotence,\nerectile dysfunction,\n\n00:10:01.918 --> 00:10:04.694\nurinary incontinence, rectal tearing,\n\n00:10:04.718 --> 00:10:06.174\nfecal incontinence.\n\n00:10:06.198 --> 00:10:09.694\nAnd if you're lucky, and you're one\nof the 50 percent who has these,\n\n00:10:09.718 --> 00:10:11.758\nthey'll only last for a year or two.\n\n00:10:12.838 --> 00:10:16.454\nSo the idea of the pre-mortem\nis to think ahead of time\n\n00:10:16.478 --> 00:10:19.014\nto the questions\nthat you might be able to ask\n\n00:10:19.038 --> 00:10:21.414\nthat will push the conversation forward.\n\n00:10:21.438 --> 00:10:24.534\nYou don't want to have to manufacture\nall of this on the spot.\n\n00:10:24.558 --> 00:10:27.454\nAnd you also want to think\nabout things like quality of life.\n\n00:10:27.478 --> 00:10:29.254\nBecause you have a choice oftentimes,\n\n00:10:29.278 --> 00:10:31.574\ndo you I want a shorter life\nthat's pain-free,\n\n00:10:31.598 --> 00:10:35.374\nor a longer life that might have\na great deal of pain towards the end?\n\n00:10:35.398 --> 00:10:37.814\nThese are things to talk about\nand think about now,\n\n00:10:37.838 --> 00:10:39.654\nwith your family and your loved ones.\n\n00:10:39.678 --> 00:10:42.174\nYou might change your mind\nin the heat of the moment,\n\n00:10:42.198 --> 00:10:45.254\nbut at least you're practiced\nwith this kind of thinking.\n\n00:10:45.278 --> 00:10:49.894\nRemember, our brain under stress\nreleases cortisol,\n\n00:10:49.918 --> 00:10:52.254\nand one of the things\nthat happens at that moment\n\n00:10:52.278 --> 00:10:54.214\nis a whole bunch on systems shut down.\n\n00:10:54.238 --> 00:10:56.143\nThere's an evolutionary reason for this.\n\n00:10:56.167 --> 00:10:59.574\nFace-to-face with a predator,\nyou don't need your digestive system,\n\n00:10:59.598 --> 00:11:02.054\nor your libido, or your immune system,\n\n00:11:02.078 --> 00:11:05.734\nbecause if you're body is expending\nmetabolism on those things\n\n00:11:05.758 --> 00:11:07.414\nand you don't react quickly,\n\n00:11:07.438 --> 00:11:11.414\nyou might become the lion's lunch,\nand then none of those things matter.\n\n00:11:11.438 --> 00:11:12.854\nUnfortunately,\n\n00:11:12.878 --> 00:11:16.494\none of the things that goes out the window\nduring those times of stress\n\n00:11:16.518 --> 00:11:18.494\nis rational, logical thinking,\n\n00:11:18.518 --> 00:11:21.934\nas Danny Kahneman\nand his colleagues have shown.\n\n00:11:21.958 --> 00:11:25.134\nSo we need to train ourselves\nto think ahead\n\n00:11:25.158 --> 00:11:27.414\nto these kinds of situations.\n\n00:11:27.438 --> 00:11:33.614\nI think the important point here\nis recognizing that all of us are flawed.\n\n00:11:33.638 --> 00:11:36.494\nWe all are going to fail now and then.\n\n00:11:36.518 --> 00:11:40.134\nThe idea is to think ahead\nto what those failures might be,\n\n00:11:40.158 --> 00:11:44.054\nto put systems in place\nthat will help minimize the damage,\n\n00:11:44.078 --> 00:11:47.598\nor to prevent the bad things\nfrom happening in the first place.\n\n00:11:48.238 --> 00:11:50.894\nGetting back to that\nsnowy night in Montreal,\n\n00:11:50.918 --> 00:11:52.654\nwhen I got back from my trip,\n\n00:11:52.678 --> 00:11:56.534\nI had my contractor install\na combination lock next to the door,\n\n00:11:56.558 --> 00:12:00.094\nwith a key to the front door in it,\nan easy to remember combination.\n\n00:12:00.118 --> 00:12:01.334\nAnd I have to admit,\n\n00:12:01.358 --> 00:12:04.774\nI still have piles of mail\nthat haven't been sorted,\n\n00:12:04.798 -->

from a crisis text line is saving lives", "duration": "579", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/nancy_lublin_the_heartbreaking_text_that_inspired_a_crisis_help_line", "transcript": "A girl I've never met before changed my life and the life of thousands of other people. I'm the CEO of DoSomething.org. It's one of the largest organizations in the world for young people. In fact it's bigger than the Boy Scouts in the United States. And we're not homophobic.(Laughter)And it's true \u2014 the way we communicate with young people is by text, because that's how young people communicate. So we'll run over 200 campaigns this year, things like collecting peanut butter for food pantries, or making Valentine's Day cards for senior citizens who are homebound. And we'll text them. And we'll have a 97 percent open rate. It'll over-index Hispanic and urban. We collected 200,000 jars of peanut butter and over 365,000 Valentine's Day cards. This is big scale. OK \u2014(Applause)But there's one weird side effect. Every time we send out a text message, we get back a few dozen text messages having nothing to do with peanut butter or hunger or senior citizens \u2014 but text messages about being bullied, text messages about being addicted to pot. And the worst message we ever got said exactly this: \"He won't stop raping me. It's my dad. He told me not to tell anyone. Are you there?\"We couldn't believe this was happening. We couldn't believe that something so horrific could happen to a human being, and that she would share it with us \u2014 something so intimate, so personal. And we realized we had to stop triaging this and we had to build a crisis text line for these people in pain. So we launched Crisis Text Line, very quietly, in Chicago and El Paso \u2014 just a few thousand people in each market. And in four months, we were in all 295 area codes in America. Just to put that into perspective, that's zero marketing and faster growth than when Facebook first launched.(Applause)Text is unbelievably private. No one hears you talking. So we spike everyday at lunch time \u2014 kids are sitting at the lunch table and you think that she's texting the cute boy across the hall, but she's actually texting us about her bulimia. And we don't get the word \"like\" or \"um\" or hyperventilating or crying. We just get facts.We get things like, \"I want to die. I have a bottle of pills on the desk in front of me.\" And so the crisis counselor says, \"How about you put those pills in the drawer while we text?\" And they go back and forth for a while. And the crisis counselor gets the girl to give her her address, because if you're texting a text line, you want help. So she gets the address and the counselor triggers an active rescue while they're texting back and forth. And then it goes quiet \u2014 23 minutes with no response from this girl. And the next message that comes in says \u2014 it's the mom \u2014 \"I had no idea, and I was in the house, we're in an ambulance on our way to the hospital.\" As a mom that one just \u2014 The next message comes a month later. \"I just got out of the hospital. I was diagnosed as bipolar, and I think I'm going to be OK.\"(Applause)I would love to tell you that that's an unusual exchange, but we're doing on average 2.41 active rescues a day. Thirty percent of our text messages are about suicide and depression \u2014 huge. The beautiful thing about Crisis Text Line is that these are strangers counseling other strangers on the most intimate issues, and getting them from hot moments to cold moments. It's exciting, and I will tell you that we have done a total of more than 6.5 million text messages in less than two years.(Applause)But the thing that really gets me hot and sweaty about this, the thing that really gets me psyched is the data: 6.5 million messages \u2014 that's the volume, velocity and variety to provide a really juicy corpus. We can do things like predictive work. We can do all kinds of conclusions and learnings from that data set. So we can be better, and the world can be better. So how do we use the data to make us better? Alright, chances are someone here, someone watching this has seen a therapist or a shrink at some point in time in your life \u2014 you do not have to raise your hand.(Laughter)How do you know that person's any good? Oh, they have a degree from Harvard on the wall? Are you sure he didn't graduate in the bottom 10 percent?(Laughter)When my husband and I saw a marriage counselor, I thought she was a genius when she said, \"I'll see you guys in two weeks \u2014 but I need to see you next week, sir.\"(Laughter)We have the data to know what makes a great counselor. We know that if you text the words \"numbs\" and \"sleeve,\" there's a 99 percent match for cutting. We know that if you text in the words \"mg\" and \"rubber band,\" there's a 99 percent match for substance abuse. And we know that if you text in \"sex,\" \"oral\" and \"Mormon,\" you're questioning if you're gay. Now that's interesting information that a counselor could figure out but that algorithm in our hands means that an automatic pop-up says, \"99 percent match for cutting \u2014 try asking one of these questions\" to prompt the counselor. Or \"99 percent match for substance abuse, here are three drug clinics near the texter.\" It makes us more accurate.On the day that Robin Williams committed suicide, people flooded hotlines all over this country. It was sad to see an icon, a funnyman, commit suicide, and there were three hour wait times on every phone hotline in the country. We had a spike in volume also. The difference was if you text us, \"I want to die,\" or \"I want to kill myself,\" the algorithm reads that, you're code orange, and you become number one in the queue. So we can handle severity, not chronological.(Applause)This data is also making the world better because I'm sitting on the world's first map of real-time crises. Think about it: those 6.5 million messages, auto-tagging through natural language processes, all of these data points \u2014 I can tell you that the worst day of the week for eating disorders: Monday. The worst time of day for substance abuse: 5am. And that Montana is a beautiful place to visit but you do not want to live there, because it is the number one state for suicidal ideation.And we've made this data public and free and open. We've pulled all the personally identifiable information. And it's in a place called CrisisTrends.org. Because I want schools to be able to see that Monday is the worst day for eating disorders, so that they can plan meals and guidance counselors to be there on Mondays. And I want families to see that substance abuse questions spike at 5am. I want somebody to take care of those Native American reservations in Montana.(Applause)Data, evidence makes policy, research, journalism, policing, school boards \u2014 everything better. I don't think of myself as a mental health activist. I think of myself as a national health activist. I get really excited about this data, I'm a little nerdy. Yeah, that sounded too girly. I'm nerdy.(Laughter)I love data. And the only difference really between me and those people in hoodies down the road with their fat-funded companies, is that I'm not inspired by helping you find Chinese food at 2am in Dallas, or helping you touch your wrist and get a car immediately, or swipe right and get laid. I'm inspired \u2014(Laughter, applause)I want to use tech and data to make the world a better place. I want to use it to help that girl, who texted in about  being raped by her father. Because the truth is we never heard from her again. And I hope that she is somewhere safe and healthy, and I hope that she sees this talk and she knows that her desperation and her courage inspired the creation of Crisis Text Line and inspires me every freaking day.(Applause)", "id": 2362, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:12.918 --> 00:00:15.774\nA girl I've never met before\n\n00:00:15.798 --> 00:00:19.078\nchanged my life and the life\nof thousands of other people.\n\n00:00:19.718 --> 00:00:22.118\nI'm the CEO of DoSomething.org.\n\n00:00:22.518 --> 00:00:26.934\nIt's one of the largest organizations\nin the world for young people.\n\n00:00:26.958 --> 00:00:29.854\nIn fact it's bigger than the Boy Scouts\nin the United States.\n\n00:00:29.878 --> 00:00:31.414\nAnd we're not homophobic.\n\n00:00:31.438 --> 00:00:33.598\n(Laughter)\n\n00:00:34.038 --> 00:00:37.574\nAnd it's true -- the way we communicate\nwith young people is by text,\n\n00:00:37.598 --> 00:00:39.958\nbecause that's how\nyoung people communicate.\n\n00:00:40.438 --> 00:00:44.013\nSo we'll run over 200 campaigns this year,\n\n00:00:44.038 --> 00:00:47.734\nthings like collecting peanut butter\nfor food pantries,\n\n00:00:47.758 --> 00:00:52.598\nor making Valentine's Day cards\nfor senior citizens who are homebound.\n\n00:00:52.958 --> 00:00:54.414\nAnd we'll text them.\n\n00:00:54.438 --> 00:00:57.374\nAnd we'll have a 97 percent open rate.\n\n00:00:57.398 --> 00:01:00.094\nIt'll over-index Hispanic and urban.\n\n00:01:00.118 --> 00:01:04.094\nWe collected 200,000 jars of peanut butter\n\n00:01:04.118 --> 00:01:08.494\nand over 365,000 Valentine's Day cards.\n\n00:01:08.518 --> 00:01:10.294\nThis is big scale.

But there's one story that keeps me awake at night, and it's about Doaa.A Syrian refugee, 19 years old, she was living a grinding existence in Egypt working day wages. Her dad was constantly thinking of his thriving business back in Syria that had been blown to pieces by a bomb. And the war that drove them there was still raging in its fourth year. And the community that once welcomed them there had become weary of them. And one day, men on motorcycles tried to kidnap her. Once an aspiring student thinking only of her future, now she was scared all the time.But she was also full of hope, because she was in love with a fellow Syrian refugee named Bassem. Bassem was also struggling in Egypt, and he said to Doaa, \"Let's go to Europe; seek asylum, safety. I will work, you can study \u2014 the promise of a new life.\" And he asked her father for her hand in marriage.But they knew to get to Europe they had to risk their lives, traveling across the Mediterranean Sea, putting their hands in smugglers', notorious for their cruelty. And Doaa was terrified of the water. She always had been. She never learned to swim.It was August that year, and already 2,000 people had died trying to cross the Mediterranean, but Doaa knew of a friend who had made it all the way to Northern Europe, and she thought, \"Maybe we can, too.\" So she asked her parents if they could go, and after a painful discussion, they consented, and Bassem paid his entire life savings \u2014 2,500 dollars each \u2014 to the smugglers.It was a Saturday morning when the call came, and they were taken by bus to a beach, hundreds of people on the beach. They were taken then by small boats onto an old fishing boat, 500 of them crammed onto that boat, 300 below, [200] above. There were Syrians, Palestinians, Africans, Muslims and Christians, 100 children, including Sandra \u2014 little Sandra, six years old \u2014 and Masa, 18 months. There were families on that boat, crammed together shoulder to shoulder, feet to feet. Doaa was sitting with her legs crammed up to her chest, Bassem holding her hand.Day two on the water, they were sick with worry and sick to their stomachs from the rough sea.Day three, Doaa had a premonition. And she said to Bassem, \"I fear we're not going to make it. I fear the boat is going to sink.\" And Bassem said to her, \"Please be patient. We will make it to Sweden, we will get married and we will have a future.\"Day four, the passengers were getting agitated. They asked the captain, \"When will we get there?\" He told them to shut up, and he insulted them. He said, \"In 16 hours we will reach the shores of Italy.\" They were weak and weary. Soon they saw a boat approach \u2014 a smaller boat, 10 men on board, who started shouting at them, hurling insults, throwing sticks, asking them to all disembark and get on this smaller, more unseaworthy boat. The parents were terrified for their children, and they collectively refused to disembark. So the boat sped away in anger, and a half an hour later, came back and started deliberately ramming a hole in the side of Doaa's boat, just below where she and Bassem were sitting. And she heard how they yelled, \"Let the fish eat your flesh!\" And they started laughing as the boat capsized and sank.The 300 people below deck were doomed. Doaa was holding on to the side of the boat as it sank, and watched in horror as a small child was cut to pieces by the propeller. Bassem said to her, \"Please let go, or you'll be swept in and the propeller will kill you, too.\" And remember \u2014 she can't swim. But she let go and she started moving her arms and her legs, thinking, \"This is swimming.\" And miraculously, Bassem found a life ring. It was one of those child's rings that they use to play in swimming pools and on calm seas. And Doaa climbed onto the ring, her arms and her legs dangling by the side. Bassem was a good swimmer, so he held her hand and tread water. Around them there were corpses. Around 100 people survived initially, and they started coming together in groups, praying for rescue. But when a day went by and no one came, some people gave up hope, and Doaa and Bassem watched as men in the distance took their life vests off and sank into the water.One man approached them with a small baby perched on his shoulder, nine months old \u2014 Malek. He was holding onto a gas canister to stay afloat, and he said to them, \"I fear I am not going to survive. I'm too weak. I don't have the courage anymore.\" And he handed little Malek over to Bassem and to Doaa, and they perched her onto the life ring. So now they were three, Doaa, Bassem and little Malek.And let me take a pause in this story right here and ask the question: why do refugees like Doaa take these kinds of risks? Millions of refugees are living in exile, in limbo. They're living in countries [fleeing] from a war that has been raging for four years. Even if they wanted to return, they can't. Their homes, their businesses, their towns and their cities have been completely destroyed. This is a UNESCO World Heritage City, Homs, in Syria. So people continue to flee into neighboring countries, and we build refugee camps for them in the desert. Hundreds of thousands of people live in camps like these, and thousands and thousands more, millions, live in towns and cities. And the communities, the neighboring countries that once welcomed them with open arms and hearts are overwhelmed. There are simply not enough schools, water systems, sanitation. Even rich European countries could never handle such an influx without massive investment. The Syria war has driven almost four million people over the borders, but over seven million people are on the run inside the country. That means that over half the Syrian population has been forced to flee. Back to those neighboring countries hosting so many. They feel that the richer world has done too little to support them. And days have turned into months, months into years. A refugee's stay is supposed to be temporary.Back to Doaa and Bassem in the water. It was their second day, and Bassem was getting very weak. And now it was Doaa's turn to say to Bassem, \"My love, please hold on to hope, to our future. We will make it.\" And he said to her, \"I'm sorry, my love, that I put you in this situation. I have never loved anyone as much as I love you.\" And he released himself into the water, and Doaa watched as the love of her life drowned before her eyes.Later that day, a mother came up to Doaa with her small 18-month-old daughter, Masa. This was the little girl I showed you in the picture earlier, with the life vests. Her older sister Sandra had just drowned, and her mother knew she had to do everything in her power to save her daughter. And she said to Doaa, \"Please take this child. Let her be part of you. I will not survive.\" And then she went away and drowned.So Doaa, the 19-year-old refugee who was terrified of the water, who couldn't swim, found herself in charge of two little baby kids. And they were thirsty and they were hungry and they were agitated, and she tried her best to amuse them, to sing to them, to say words to them from the Quran. Around them, the bodies were bloating and turning black. The sun was blazing during the day. At night, there was a cold moon and fog. It was very frightening. On the fourth day in the water, this is how Doaa probably looked on the ring with her two children.A woman came on the fourth day and approached her and asked her to take another child \u2014 a little boy, just four years old. When Doaa took the little boy and the mother drowned, she said to the sobbing child, \"She just went away to find you water and food.\" But his heart soon stopped, and Doaa had to release the little boy into the water.Later that day, she looked up into the sky with hope, because she saw two planes crossing in the sky. And she waved her arms, hoping they would see her, but the planes were soon gone.But that afternoon, as the sun was going down, she saw a boat, a merchant vessel. And she said, \"Please, God, let them rescue me.\" She waved her arms and she felt like she shouted for about two hours. And it had become dark, but finally the searchlights found her and they extended a rope, astonished to see a woman clutching onto two babies.They pulled them onto the boat, they got oxygen and blankets, and a Greek helicopter came to pick them up and take them to the island of Crete.But Doaa looked down and asked, \"What of Malek?\" And they told her the little baby did not survive \u2014 she drew her last breath in the boat's clinic. But Doaa was sure that as they had been pulled up onto the rescue boat, that little baby girl had been smiling.Only 11 people survived that wreck, of the 500. There was never an international investigation into what happened. There were some media reports about mass murder at sea, a terrible tragedy, but that was only for one day. And then the news cycle moved on.Meanwhile, in a pediatric hospital on Crete, little Masa was on the edge of death. She was really dehydrated. Her kidneys were failing. Her glucose levels were dangerously low. The doctors did everything in their medical power to save them, and the Greek nurses never left her side, holding her, hugging her, singing her words. My colleagues also visited and said pretty words to her in Arabic. Amazingly, little Masa survived.And soon the Greek press started reporting about the miracle baby, who had survived four days in the water without food or anything to drink, and offers to adopt her came from all over the country.And meanwhile, Doaa was in another hospital on Crete, thin, dehydrated. An Egyptian family took her into their home as soon as she was released. And soon word went around about Doaa's survival, and a phone number was published on Facebook. Messages started coming in.\"Doaa, do you know what happened to my brother? My sister? My parents? My friends? Do you know if they survived?\"One of those messages said, \"I believe you saved my little niece, Masa.\" And it had this photo. This was from Masa's uncle, a Syrian refugee who had made it to Sweden with his family and also Masa's older sister. Soon, we hope, Masa will be reunited with him in Sweden, and until then, she's being cared for in a beautiful orphanage in Athens.And Doaa? Well, word went around about her survival, too. And the media wrote about this slight woman, and couldn't imagine how she could survive all this time under such conditions in that sea, and still save another life. The Academy of Athens, one of Greece's most prestigious institutions, gave her an award of bravery, and she deserves all that praise, and she deserves a second chance. But she wants to still go to Sweden. She wants to reunite with her family there. She wants to bring her mother and her father and her younger siblings away from Egypt there as well, and I believe she will succeed. She wants to become a lawyer or a politician or something that can help fight injustice. She is an extraordinary survivor.But I have to ask: what if she didn't have to take that risk? Why did she have to go through all that? Why wasn't there a legal way for her to study in Europe? Why couldn't Masa have taken an airplane to Sweden? Why couldn't Bassem have found work? Why is there no massive resettlement program for Syrian refugees, the victims of the worst war of our times? The world did this for the Vietnamese in the 1970s. Why not now? Why is there so little investment in the neighboring countries hosting so many refugees? And why, the root question, is so little being done to stop the wars, the persecution and the poverty that is driving so many people to the shores of Europe? Until these issues are resolved, people will continue to take to the seas and to seek safety and asylum.And what happens next? Well, that is largely Europe's choice. And I understand the public fears. People are worried about their security, their economies, the changes of culture. But is that more important than saving human lives? Because there is something fundamental here that I think overrides the rest, and it is about our common humanity. No person fleeing war or persecution should have to die crossing a sea to reach safety.(Applause)One thing is for sure, that no refugee would be on those dangerous boats if they could thrive where they are. And no migrant would take that dangerous journey if they had enough food for themselves and their children. And no one would put their life savings in the hands of those notorious smugglers if there was a legal way to migrate.So on behalf of little Masa and on behalf of Doaa and of Bassem and of those 500 people who drowned with them, can we make sure that they did not die in vain? Could we be inspired by what happened, and take a stand for a world in which every life matters?Thank you.(Applause)", "id": 2358, "subtitle":

anger,\n\n00:04:29.255 --> 00:04:33.485\nand a half an hour later, came back\n\n00:04:33.509 --> 00:04:39.561\nand started deliberately ramming a hole\nin the side of Doaa's boat,\n\n00:04:39.585 --> 00:04:42.198\njust below where she\nand Bassem were sitting.\n\n00:04:43.722 --> 00:04:47.061\nAnd she heard how they yelled,\n\n00:04:47.085 --> 00:04:50.446\n\"Let the fish eat your flesh!\"\n\n00:04:51.557 --> 00:04:57.395\nAnd they started laughing\nas the boat capsized and sank.\n\n00:04:57.957 --> 00:05:01.016\nThe 300 people below deck were doomed.\n\n00:05:01.715 --> 00:05:06.304\nDoaa was holding on to the side\nof the boat as it sank,\n\n00:05:06.328 --> 00:05:13.146\nand watched in horror as a small child\nwas cut to pieces by the propeller.\n\n00:05:14.313 --> 00:05:16.512\nBassem said to her, \"Please let go,\n\n00:05:16.536 --> 00:05:19.701\nor you'll be swept in and the propeller\nwill kill you, too.\"\n\n00:05:20.225 --> 00:05:22.273\nAnd remember -- she can't swim.\n\n00:05:22.957 --> 00:05:27.145\nBut she let go and she started moving\nher arms and her legs,\n\n00:05:27.169 --> 00:05:28.605\nthinking, \"This is swimming.\"\n\n00:05:28.629 --> 00:05:33.002\nAnd miraculously,\nBassem found a life ring.\n\n00:05:33.764 --> 00:05:35.812\nIt was one of those child's rings\n\n00:05:35.836 --> 00:05:39.933\nthat they use to play\nin swimming pools and on calm seas.\n\n00:05:39.957 --> 00:05:42.002\nAnd Doaa climbed onto the ring,\n\n00:05:42.026 --> 00:05:45.746\nher arms and her legs\ndangling by the side.\n\n00:05:46.793 --> 00:05:48.734\nBassem was a good swimmer,\n\n00:05:48.758 --> 00:05:52.552\nso he held her hand and tread water.\n\n00:05:54.022 --> 00:05:55.960\nAround them there were corpses.\n\n00:05:55.984 --> 00:05:58.452\nAround 100 people survived initially,\n\n00:05:58.476 --> 00:06:03.017\nand they started coming together\nin groups, praying for rescue.\n\n00:06:03.041 --> 00:06:07.358\nBut when a day went by and no one came,\n\n00:06:07.382 --> 00:06:09.207\nsome people gave up hope,\n\n00:06:09.231 --> 00:06:11.405\nand Doaa and Bassem watched\n\n00:06:11.429 --> 00:06:18.010\nas men in the distance took their\nlife vests off and sank into the water.\n\n00:06:19.010 --> 00:06:24.933\nOne man approached them\nwith a small baby perched on his shoulder,\n\n00:06:24.957 --> 00:06:26.607\nnine months old -- Malek.\n\n00:06:26.631 --> 00:06:31.710\nHe was holding onto a gas canister\nto stay afloat, and he said to them,\n\n00:06:31.734 --> 00:06:33.684\n\"I fear I am not going to survive.\n\n00:06:33.708 --> 00:06:36.374\nI'm too weak. I don't have\nthe courage anymore.\"\n\n00:06:36.787 --> 00:06:41.933\nAnd he handed little Malek\nover to Bassem and to Doaa,\n\n00:06:41.957 --> 00:06:44.669\nand they perched her onto the life ring.\n\n00:06:45.732 --> 00:06:51.146\nSo now they were three,\nDoaa, Bassem and little Malek.\n\n00:06:51.170 --> 00:06:54.299\nAnd let me take a pause\nin this story right here\n\n00:06:54.323 --> 00:06:56.621\nand ask the question:\n\n00:06:56.645 --> 00:07:01.438\nwhy do refugees like Doaa\ntake these kinds of risks?\n\n00:07:03.019 --> 00:07:07.862\nMillions of refugees are living\nin exile, in limbo.\n\n00:07:09.190 --> 00:07:13.490\nThey're living in countries [fleeing]\nfrom a war that has been raging\n\n00:07:13.514 --> 00:07:15.798\nfor four years.\n\n00:07:17.592 --> 00:07:20.753\nEven if they wanted to return, they can't.\n\n00:07:20.777 --> 00:07:23.539\nTheir homes, their businesses,\n\n00:07:23.563 --> 00:07:27.085\ntheir towns and their cities\nhave been completely destroyed.\n\n00:07:27.109 --> 00:07:29.933\nThis is a UNESCO World Heritage City,\n\n00:07:29.957 --> 00:07:31.714\nHoms, in Syria.\n\n00:07:33.055 --> 00:07:37.620\nSo people continue to flee\ninto neighboring countries,\n\n00:07:37.644 --> 00:07:41.243\nand we build refugee camps\nfor them in the desert.\n\n00:07:41.267 --> 00:07:45.277\nHundreds of thousands of people\nlive in camps like these,\n\n00:07:45.301 --> 00:07:50.274\nand thousands and thousands more,\nmillions, live in towns and cities.\n\n00:07:50.298 --> 00:07:51.516\nAnd the communities,\n\n00:07:51.540 --> 00:07:54.396\nthe neighboring countries\nthat once welcomed them\n\n00:07:54.420 --> 00:07:56.182\nwith open arms and hearts\n\n00:07:56.206 --> 00:07:57.824\nare overwhelmed.\n\n00:07:58.689 --> 00:08:03.141\nThere are simply not enough schools,\nwater systems, sanitation.\n\n00:08:03.705 --> 00:08:08.328\nEven rich European countries\ncould never handle such an influx\n\n00:08:08.352 --> 00:08:11.595\nwithout massive investment.\n\n00:08:13.365 --> 00:08:18.391\nThe Syria war has driven almost\nfour million people over the borders,\n\n00:08:18.415 --> 00:08:23.352\nbut over seven million people\nare on the run inside the country.\n\n00:08:23.376 --> 00:08:27.067\nThat means that over half\nthe Syrian population\n\n00:08:27.091 --> 00:08:29.351\nhas been forced to flee.\n\n00:08:29.724 --> 00:08:34.017\nBack to those neighboring\ncountries hosting so many.\n\n00:08:35.072 --> 00:08:40.105\nThey feel that the richer world\nhas done too little to support them.\n\n00:08:41.359 --> 00:08:45.756\nAnd days have turned into months,\nmonths into years.\n\n00:08:46.441 --> 00:08:50.013\nA refugee's stay is supposed\nto be temporary.\n\n00:08:50.037 --> 00:08:53.358\nBack to Doaa and Bassem in the water.\n\n00:08:53.382 --> 00:08:57.731\nIt was their second day,\nand Bassem was getting very weak.\n\n00:08:58.722 --> 00:09:02.723\nAnd now it was Doaa's turn\nto say to Bassem,\n\n00:09:02.747 --> 00:09:08.430\n\"My love, please hold on to hope,\nto our future. We will make it.\"\n\n00:09:09.334 --> 00:09:12.015\nAnd he said to her,\n\n00:09:12.039 --> 00:09:16.476\n\"I'm sorry, my love,\nthat I put you in this situation.\n\n00:09:16.500 --> 00:09:21.177\nI have never loved anyone\nas much as I love you.\"\n\n00:09:22.829 --> 00:09:26.227\nAnd he released himself into the water,\n\n00:09:26.251 --> 00:09:32.507\nand Doaa watched as the love of her life\ndrowned before her eyes.\n\n00:09:35.846 --> 00:09:38.262\nLater that day,\n\n00:09:38.286 --> 00:09:43.937\na mother came up to Doaa with her\nsmall 18-month-old daughter, Masa.\n\n00:09:44.699 --> 00:09:47.624\nThis was the little girl I showed you\nin the picture earlier,\n\n00:09:47.648 --> 00:09:49.496\nwith the life vests.\n\n00:09:49.520 --> 00:09:51.713\nHer older sister Sandra had just drowned,\n\n00:09:51.737 --> 00:09:55.856\nand her mother knew she had to do\neverything in her power\n\n00:09:55.880 --> 00:09:57.372\nto save her daughter.\n\n00:09:57.951 --> 00:10:01.808\nAnd she said to Doaa,\n\"Please take this child.\n\n00:10:01.832 --> 00:10:05.860\nLet her be part of you.\nI will not survive.\"\n\n00:10:07.083 --> 00:10:10.425\nAnd then she went away and drowned.\n\n00:10:11.783 --> 00:10:16.017\nSo Doaa, the 19-year-old refugee\nwho was terrified of the water,\n\n00:10:16.041 --> 00:10:17.933\nwho couldn't swim,\n\n00:10:17.957 --> 00:10:23.549\nfound herself in charge\nof two little baby kids.\n\n00:10:23.573 --> 00:10:27.254\nAnd they were thirsty and they were hungry\nand they were agitated,\n\n00:10:27.278 --> 00:10:29.976\nand she tried her best to amuse them,\n\n00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:34.033\nto sing to them, to say words\nto them from the Quran.\n\n00:10:35.192 --> 00:10:39.626\nAround them, the bodies were bloating\nand turning black.\n\n00:10:39.650 --> 00:10:41.396\nThe sun was blazing during the day.\n\n00:10:41.420 --> 00:10:44.140\nAt night, there was a cold moon and fog.\n\n00:10:44.164 --> 00:10:46.140\nIt was very frightening.\n\n00:10:46.934 --> 00:10:51.673\nOn the fourth day in the water,\nthis is how Doaa probably looked\n\n00:10:51.697 --> 00:10:53.818\non the ring with her two children.\n\n00:10:53.842 --> 00:10:57.389\nA woman came on the fourth day\nand approached her\n\n00:10:57.413 --> 00:11:00.524\nand asked her to take another child --\n\n00:11:00.548 --> 00:11:03.563\na little boy, just four years old.\n\n00:11:04.957 --> 00:11:08.974\nWhen Doaa took the little boy\nand the mother drowned,\n\n00:11:08.998 --> 00:11:10.958\nshe said to the sobbing child,\n\n00:11:10.982 --> 00:11:14.418\n\"She just went away\nto find you water and food.\"\n\n00:11:16.346 --> 00:11:18.339\nBut his heart soon stopped,\n\n00:11:18.363 --> 00:11:22.036\nand Doaa had to release\nthe little boy into the water.\n\n00:11:22.981 --> 00:11:25.006\nLater that day,\n\n00:11:25.030 --> 00:11:28.309\nshe looked up into the sky with hope,\n\n00:11:28.333 --> 00:11:32.348\nbecause she saw two planes\ncrossing in the sky.\n\n00:11:32.372 --> 00:11:36.871\nAnd she waved her arms,\nhoping they would see her,\n\n00:11:36.895 --> 00:11:38.751\nbut the planes were soon gone.\n\n00:11:39.275 --> 00:11:42.178\nBut that afternoon,\nas the sun was going down,\n\n00:11:42.202 --> 00:11:45.058\nshe saw a boat, a merchant vessel.\n\n00:11:46.067 --> 00:11:50.084\nAnd she said, \"Please, God,\nlet them rescue me.\"\n\n00:11:50.108 --> 00:11:54.068\nShe waved her arms and she felt\nlike she shouted for about two hours.\n\n00:11:54.092 --> 00:11:58.702\nAnd it had become dark,\nbut finally the searchlights found her\n\n00:11:58.726 --> 00:12:00.933\nand they extended a rope,\n\n00:12:00.957 --> 00:12:05.926\nastonished to see a woman\nclutching onto two babies.\n\n00:12:06.728 --> 00:12:10.216\nThey pulled them onto the boat,\nthey got oxygen and blankets,\n\n00:12:10.240 --> 00:12:13.247\nand a Greek helicopter came\nto pick them up\n\n00:12:13.271 --> 00:12:15.383\nand take them to the island of Crete.\n\n00:12:16.311 --> 00:12:19.818\nBut Doaa looked down and asked,\n\"What of Malek?\"\n\n00:12:20.358 --> 00:12:23.933\nAnd they told her the little baby\ndid not survive --\n\n00:12:23.957 --> 00:12:27.344\nshe drew her last breath\nin the boat's clinic.\n\n00:12:28.161 --> 00:12:33.933\nBut Doaa was sure that as they had\nbeen pulled up onto the rescue boat,\n\n00:12:33.957 --> 00:12:37.204\nthat little baby girl had been smiling.\n\n00:12:39.236 --> 00:12:45.238\nOnly 11 people survived\nthat wreck, of the 500.\n\n00:12:46.262 --> 00:12:50.933\nThere was never an international\ninvestigation into what happened.\n\n00:12:50.957 --> 00:12:55.052\nThere were some media reports\nabout mass murder at sea,\n\n00:12:55.076 --> 00:12:56.401\na terrible tragedy,\n\n00:12:56.425 --> 00:12:58.892\nbut that was only for one day.\n\n00:12:59.448 --> 00:13:03.272\nAnd then the news cycle moved on.\n\n00:13:04.494 --> 00:13:09.036\nMeanwhile, in a pediatric\nhospital on Crete,\n\n00:13:09.060 --> 00:13:12.432\nlittle Masa was on the edge of death.\n\n00:13:13.639 --> 00:13:17.349\nShe was really dehydrated.\nHer kidneys were failing.\n\n00:13:17.373 --> 00:13:19.397\nHer glucose levels were dangerously low.\n\n00:13:19.421 --> 00:13:22.987\nThe doctors did everything\nin their medical power to save them,\n\n00:13:23.011 --> 00:13:26.671\nand the Greek nurses never left her side,\n\n00:13:26.695 --> 00:13:28.822\nholding her, hugging her,\nsinging her words.\n\n00:13:28.846 --> 00:13:34.415\nMy colleagues also visited\nand said pretty words to her in Arabic.\n\n00:13:34.439 --> 00:13:38.635\nAmazingly, little Masa survived.\n\n00:13:40.150 --> 00:13:46.086\nAnd soon the Greek press started reporting\nabout the miracle baby,\n\n00:13:46.110 --> 00:13:51.777\nwho had survived four days in the water\nwithout food or anything to drink,\n\n00:13:51.801 --> 00:13:56.535\nand offers to adopt her came\nfrom all over the country.\n\n00:13:57.424 --> 00:14:00.814\nAnd meanwhile, Doaa\nwas in another hospital on Crete,\n\n00:14:00.838 --> 00:14:02.450\nthin, dehydrated.\n\n00:14:03.529 --> 00:14:09.074\nAn Egyptian family took her into their\nhome as soon as she was released.\n\n00:14:10.206 --> 00:14:14.953\nAnd soon word went around\nabout Doaa's survival,\n\n00:14:14.977 --> 00:14:18.155\nand a phone number\nwas published on Facebook.\n\n00:14:19.258 --> 00:14:21.823\nMessages started coming in.\n\n00:14:22.957 --> 00:14:27.745\n\"Doaa, do you know\nwhat happened to my brother?\n\n00:14:27.769 --> 00:14:34.310\nMy sister? My parents?

This is a tapir. Now this, this is a baby tapir, the cutest animal offspring in the animal kingdom.(Laughter)By far. There is no competition here.I have dedicated the past 20 years of my life to the research and conservation of tapirs in Brazil, and it has been absolutely amazing. But at the moment, I've been thinking really, really hard about the impact of my work. I've been questioning myself about the real contributions I have made for the conservation of these animals I love so much. Am I being effective in safeguarding their survival? Am I doing enough? I guess the big question here is, am I studying tapirs and contributing to their conservation, or am I just documenting their extinction?The world is facing so many different conservation crises. We all know that. It's all over the news every day. Tropical forests and other ecosystems are being destroyed, climate change, so many species on the brink of extinction: tigers, lions, elephants, rhinos, tapirs.This is the lowland tapir, the tapir species I work with, the largest terrestrial mammal of South America. They're massive. They're powerful. Adults can weigh up to 300 kilos. That's half the size of a horse. They're gorgeous.Tapirs are mostly found in tropical forests such as the Amazon, and they absolutely need large patches of habitat in order to find all the resources they need to reproduce and survive. But their habitat is being destroyed, and they have been hunted out of several parts of their geographic distribution.And you see, this is very, very unfortunate because tapirs are extremely important for the habitats where they are found. They're herbivores. Fifty percent of their diet consists of fruit, and when they eat the fruit, they swallow the seeds, which they disperse throughout the habitat through their feces. They play this major role in shaping and maintaining the structure and diversity of the forest, and for that reason, tapirs are known as gardeners of the forest. Isn't that amazing? If you think about it, the extinction of tapirs would seriously affect biodiversity as a whole.I started my tapir work in 1996, still very young, fresh out of college, and it was a pioneer research and conservation program. At that point, we had nearly zero information about tapirs, mostly because they're so difficult to study. They're nocturnal, solitary, very elusive animals, and we got started getting very basic data about these animals.But what is it that a conservationist does? Well, first, we need data. We need field research. We need those long-term datasets to support conservation action, and I told you tapirs are very hard to study, so we have to rely on indirect methods to study them. We have to capture and anesthetize them so that we can install GPS collars around their necks and follow their movements, which is a technique used by many other conservationists around the world. And then we can gather information about how they use space, how they move through the landscape, what are their priority habitats, and so much more.Next, we must disseminate what we learn. We have to educate people about tapirs and how important these animals are. And it's amazing how many people around the world do not know what a tapir is. In fact, many people think this is a tapir. Let me tell you, this is not a tapir.(Laughter)This is a giant anteater. Tapirs do not eat ants. Never. Ever.And then next we have to provide training, capacity building. It is our responsibility to prepare the conservationists of the future. We are losing several conservation battles, and we need more people doing what we do, and they need the skills, and they need the passion to do that. Ultimately, we conservationists, we must be able to apply our data, to apply our accumulated knowledge to support actual conservation action. Our first tapir program took place in the Atlantic Forest in the eastern part of Brazil, one of the most threatened biomes in the world. The destruction of the Atlantic Forest began in the early 1500s, when the Portuguese first arrived in Brazil, beginning European colonization in the eastern part of South America. This forest was almost completely cleared for timber, agriculture, cattle ranching and the construction of cities, and today only seven percent of the Atlantic forest is still left standing. And tapirs are found in very, very small, isolated, disconnected populations. In the Atlantic Forest, we found out that tapirs move through open areas of pastureland and agriculture going from one patch of forest to patch of forest. So our main approach in this region was to use our tapir data to identify the potential places for the establishment of wildlife corridors in between those patches of forest, reconnecting the habitat so that tapirs and many other animals could cross the landscape safely.After 12 years in the Atlantic Forest, in 2008, we expanded our tapir conservation efforts to the Pantanal in the western part of Brazil near the border with Bolivia and Paraguay. This is the largest continuous freshwater floodplain in the world, an incredible place and one of the most important strongholds for lowland tapirs in South America. And working in the Pantanal has been extremely refreshing because we found large, healthy tapir populations in the area, and we have been able to study tapirs in the most natural conditions we'll ever find, very much free of threats.In the Pantanal, besides the GPS collars, we are using another technique: camera traps. This camera is equipped with a movement sensor and it photographs animals when they walk in front of it. So thanks to these amazing devices, we have been able to gather precious information about tapir reproduction and social organization which are very important pieces of the puzzle when you're trying to develop those conservation strategies.And right now, 2015, we are expanding our work once again to the Brazilian Cerrado, the open grasslands and shrub forests in the central part of Brazil. Today this region is the very epicenter of economic development in my country, where natural habitat and wildlife populations are rapidly being eradicated by several different threats, including once again cattle ranching, large sugarcane and soybean plantations, poaching, roadkill, just to name a few. And somehow, tapirs are still there, which gives me a lot of hope. But I have to say that starting this new program in the Cerrado was a bit of a slap in the face. When you drive around and you find dead tapirs along the highways and signs of tapirs wandering around in the middle of sugarcane plantations where they shouldn't be, and you talk to kids and they tell you that they know how tapir meat tastes because their families poach and eat them, it really breaks your heart.The situation in the Cerrado made me realize \u2014 it gave me the sense of urgency. I am swimming against the tide. It made me realize that despite two decades of hard work trying to save these animals, we still have so much work to do if we are to prevent them from disappearing. We have to find ways to solve all these problems. We really do, and you know what? We really came to a point in the conservation world where we have to think out of the box. We'll have to be a lot more creative than we are right now. And I told you, roadkill is a big problem for tapirs in the Cerrado, so we just came up with the idea of putting reflective stickers on the GPS collars we put on the tapirs. These are the same stickers used on big trucks to avoid collision. Tapirs cross the highways after dark, so the stickers will hopefully help drivers see this shining thing crossing the highway, and maybe they will slow down a little bit. For now, this is just a crazy idea. We don't know. We'll see if it will reduce the amount of tapir roadkill. But the point is, maybe this is the kind of stuff that needs to be done.And although I'm struggling with all these questions in my mind right now, I have a pact with tapirs. I know in my heart that tapir conservation is my cause. This is my passion. I am not alone. I have this huge network of supporters behind me, and there is no way I'm ever going to stop. I will continue doing this, most probably for the rest of my life. And I'll keep doing this for Patr\u00edcia, my namesake, one of the first tapirs we captured and monitored in the Atlantic Forest many, many years ago; for Rita and her baby Vincent in the Pantanal. And I'll keep doing this for Ted, a baby tapir we captured in December last year also in the Pantanal.And I will keep doing this for the hundreds of tapirs that I've had the pleasure to meet over the years and the many others I know I will encounter in the future. These animals deserve to be cared for. They need me. They need us. And you know? We human beings deserve to live in a world where we can get out there and see and benefit from not only tapirs but all the other beautiful species, now and in the future.Thank you so much.(Applause)", "id": 2367, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:12.638 --> 00:00:18.774\nThis is one of the most amazing animals\non the face of the Earth.\n\n00:00:18.798 --> 00:00:20.894\nThis is a tapir.\n\n00:00:20.918 --> 00:00:24.574\nNow this, this is a baby tapir,\n\n00:00:24.598 --> 00:00:28.534\nthe cutest animal offspring\nin the animal kingdom.\n\n00:00:28.558 --> 00:00:29.934\n(Laughter)\n\n00:00:29.958 --> 00:00:31.534\nBy far.\n\n00:00:31.558 --> 00:00:33.198\nThere is no competition here.\n\n00:00:35.478 --> 00:00:38.174\nI have dedicated\nthe past 20 years of my life\n\n00:00:38.198 --> 00:00:41.374\nto the research and conservation\nof tapirs in Brazil,\n\n00:00:41.398 --> 00:00:45.094\nand it has been absolutely amazing.\n\n00:00:45.118 --> 00:00:48.614\nBut at the moment,\nI've been thinking really, really hard\n\n00:00:48.638 --> 00:00:51.054\nabout the impact of my work.\n\n00:00:51.078 --> 00:00:55.174\nI've been questioning myself\nabout the real contributions I have made\n\n00:00:55.198 --> 00:00:58.734\nfor the conservation\nof these animals I love so much.\n\n00:00:58.758 --> 00:01:00.614\nAm I being effective\n\n00:01:00.638 --> 00:01:03.614\nin safeguarding their survival?\n\n00:01:03.638 --> 00:01:05.974\nAm I doing enough?\n\n00:01:05.998 --> 00:01:08.294\nI guess the big question here is,\n\n00:01:08.318 --> 00:01:13.694\nam I studying tapirs\nand contributing to their conservation,\n\n00:01:13.718 --> 00:01:16.158\nor am I just documenting their extinction?\n\n00:01:17.718 --> 00:01:21.654\nThe world is facing\nso many different conservation crises.\n\n00:01:21.678 --> 00:01:25.014\nWe all know that.\nIt's all over the news every day.\n\n00:01:25.038 --> 00:01:29.334\nTropical forests and other ecosystems\nare being destroyed,\n\n00:01:29.358 --> 00:01:33.614\nclimate change, so many species\non the brink of extinction:\n\n00:01:33.638 --> 00:01:39.238\ntigers, lions, elephants, rhinos, tapirs.\n\n00:01:40.198 --> 00:01:43.894\nThis is the lowland tapir,\nthe tapir species I work with,\n\n00:01:43.918 --> 00:01:47.054\nthe largest terrestrial mammal\nof South America.\n\n00:01:47.078 --> 00:01:49.614\nThey're massive. They're powerful.\n\n00:01:49.638 --> 00:01:52.174\nAdults can weigh up to 300 kilos.\n\n00:01:52.198 --> 00:01:54.294\nThat's half the size of a horse.\n\n00:01:54.318 --> 00:01:56.134\nThey're gorgeous.\n\n00:01:56.158 --> 00:02:01.054\nTapirs are mostly found\nin tropical forests such as the Amazon,\n\n00:02:01.078 --> 00:02:05.534\nand they absolutely need\nlarge patches of habitat\n\n00:02:05.558 --> 00:02:11.094\nin order to find all the resources\nthey need to reproduce and survive.\n\n00:02:11.118 --> 00:02:14.054\nBut their habitat is being destroyed,\n\n00:02:14.078 --> 00:02:19.574\nand they have been hunted out of several\nparts of their geographic distribution.\n\n00:02:19.598 --> 00:02:23.334\nAnd you see, this is\nvery, very unfortunate\n\n00:02:23.358 --> 00:02:27.734\nbecause tapirs are extremely important\nfor the habitats where they are found.\n\n00:02:27.758 --> 00:02:29.134\nThey're herbivores.\n\n00:02:29.158 --> 00:02:32.494\nFifty percent of their diet\nconsists of fruit,\n\n00:02:32.518 --> 00:02:35.414\nand when they eat the fruit,\nthey swallow the seeds,\n\n00:02:35.438 --> 00:02:39.054\nwhich they disperse throughout\nthe habitat through their feces.\n\n00:02:39.078 --> 00:02:43.614\nThey play this major role\nin shaping and maintaining\n\n00:02:43.638 --> 00:02:47.094\nthe structure and diversity of the forest,\n\n00:02:47.118 --> 00:02:53.254\nand for that reason, tapirs are known\nas gardeners of the forest.\n\n00:02:53.278 --> 00:02:55.014\nIsn't that amazing?\n\n00:02:55.038 --> 00:02:56.854\nIf you think about it,\n\n00:02:56.878 --> 00:02:59.934\nthe extinction of tapirs\nwould seriously affect\n\n00:02:59.958 --> 00:03:02.854\nbiodiversity as a whole.\n\n00:03:02.878 --> 00:03:08.774\nI started my tapir work in 1996,\nstill very young, fresh out of college,\n\n00:03:08.798 --> 00:03:12.134\nand it was a pioneer research\nand conservation program.\n\n00:03:12.158 --> 00:03:15.494\nAt that point, we had nearly\nzero information about tapirs,\n\n00:03:15.518 --> 00:03:18.814\nmostly because they're\nso difficult to study.\n\n00:03:18.838 --> 00:03:23.374\nThey're nocturnal, solitary,\nvery elusive animals,\n\n00:03:23.398 --> 00:03:28.574\nand we got started getting\nvery basic data about these animals.\n\n00:03:28.598 --> 00:03:32.454\nBut what is it\nthat a conservationist does?\n\n00:03:32.478 --> 00:03:34.734\nWell, first, we need data.\n\n00:03:34.758 --> 00:03:36.334\nWe need field research.\n\n00:03:36.358 --> 00:03:40.974\nWe need those long-term datasets\nto support conservation action,\n\n00:03:40.998 --> 00:03:44.014\nand I told you tapirs\nare very hard to study,\n\n00:03:44.038 --> 00:03:47.974\nso we have to rely\non indirect methods to study them.\n\n00:03:47.998 --> 00:03:50.694\nWe have to capture and anesthetize them\n\n00:03:50.718 --> 00:03:54.174\nso that we can install GPS collars\naround their necks\n\n00:03:54.198 --> 00:03:55.854\nand follow their movements,\n\n00:03:55.878 --> 00:04:00.294\nwhich is a technique used by many\nother conservationists around the world.\n\n00:04:00.318 --> 00:04:04.254\nAnd then we can gather information\nabout how they use space,\n\n00:04:04.278 --> 00:04:06.334\nhow they move through the landscape,\n\n00:04:06.358 --> 00:04:08.334\nwhat are their priority habitats,\n\n00:04:08.358 --> 00:04:10.414\nand so much more.\n\n00:04:10.438 --> 00:04:14.374\nNext, we must disseminate what we learn.\n\n00:04:14.398 --> 00:04:17.094\nWe have to educate people about tapirs\n\n00:04:17.118 --> 00:04:19.734\nand how important these animals are.\n\n00:04:19.758 --> 00:04:23.374\nAnd it's amazing\nhow many people around the world\n\n00:04:23.398 --> 00:04:26.214\ndo not know what a tapir is.\n\n00:04:26.238 --> 00:04:29.438\nIn fact, many people think\nthis is a tapir.\n\n00:04:30.878 --> 00:04:33.374\nLet me tell you, this is not a tapir.\n\n00:04:33.398 --> 00:04:34.814\n(Laughter)\n\n00:04:34.838 --> 00:04:36.774\nThis is a giant anteater.\n\n00:04:36.798 --> 00:04:40.318\nTapirs do not eat ants. Never. Ever.\n\n00:04:42.398 --> 00:04:47.134\nAnd then next we have to provide\ntraining, capacity building.\n\n00:04:47.158 --> 00:04:51.614\nIt is our responsibility to prepare\nthe conservationists of the future.\n\n00:04:51.638 --> 00:04:54.694\nWe are losing several\nconservation battles,\n\n00:04:54.718 --> 00:04:57.174\nand we need more people doing what we do,\n\n00:04:57.198 --> 00:05:01.574\nand they need the skills,\nand they need the passion to do that.\n\n00:05:01.598 --> 00:05:04.134\nUltimately, we conservationists,\n\n00:05:04.158 --> 00:05:06.774\nwe must be able to apply our data,\n\n00:05:06.798 --> 00:05:09.014\nto apply our accumulated knowledge\n\n00:05:09.038 --> 00:05:12.974\nto support actual conservation action.\n\n00:05:12.998 --> 00:05:14.974\nOur first tapir program\n\n00:05:14.998 --> 00:05:17.254\ntook place in the Atlantic Forest\n\n00:05:17.278 --> 00:05:19.414\nin the eastern part of Brazil,\n\n00:05:19.438 --> 00:05:22.814\none of the most threatened\nbiomes in the world.\n\n00:05:22.838 --> 00:05:25.014\nThe destruction of the Atlantic Forest\n\n00:05:25.038 --> 00:05:27.254\nbegan in the early 1500s,\n\n00:05:27.278 --> 00:05:30.054\nwhen the Portuguese\nfirst arrived in Brazil,\n\n00:05:30.078 --> 00:05:34.494\nbeginning European colonization\nin the eastern part of South America.\n\n00:05:34.518 --> 00:05:37.814\nThis forest was almost completely cleared\n\n00:05:37.838 --> 00:05:43.054\nfor timber, agriculture, cattle ranching\nand the construction of cities,\n\n00:05:43.078 --> 00:05:46.534\nand today only seven percent\nof the Atlantic forest\n\n00:05:46.558 --> 00:05:48.734\nis still left standing.\n\n00:05:48.758 --> 00:05:55.134\nAnd tapirs are found in very, very small,\nisolated, disconnected populations.\n\n00:05:55.158 --> 00:05:59.814\nIn the Atlantic Forest, we found out\nthat tapirs move through open areas\n\n00:05:59.838 --> 00:06:02.174\nof pastureland and agriculture\n\n00:06:02.198 --> 00:06:06.414\ngoing from one patch of forest\nto patch of forest.\n\n00:06:06.438 --> 00:06:08.974\nSo our main approach in this region\n\n00:06:08.998 --> 00:06:13.374\nwas to use our tapir data\nto identify the potential places\n\n00:06:13.398 --> 00:06:16.374\nfor the establishment\nof wildlife corridors\n\n00:06:16.398 --> 00:06:19.054\nin between those patches of forest,\n\n00:06:19.078 --> 00:06:21.134\nreconnecting the habitat\n\n00:06:21.158 --> 00:06:25.894\nso that tapirs and many other animals\ncould cross the landscape safely.\n\n00:06:25.918 --> 00:06:28.654\nAfter 12 years in the Atlantic Forest,\n\n00:06:28.678 --> 00:06:33.694\nin 2008, we expanded our tapir\nconservation efforts to the Pantanal\n\n00:06:33.718 --> 00:06:35.694\nin the western part of Brazil\n\n00:06:35.718 --> 00:06:39.094\nnear the border with Bolivia and Paraguay.\n\n00:06:39.118 --> 00:06:44.534\nThis is the largest continuous\nfreshwater floodplain in the world,\n\n00:06:44.558 --> 00:06:46.014\nan incredible place\n\n00:06:46.038 --> 00:06:50.694\nand one of the most important strongholds\nfor lowland tapirs in South America.\n\n00:06:50.718 --> 00:06:55.214\nAnd working in the Pantanal\nhas been extremely refreshing\n\n00:06:55.238 --> 00:06:59.214\nbecause we found large,\nhealthy tapir populations in the area,\n\n00:06:59.238 --> 00:07:01.174\nand we have been able to study tapirs\n\n00:07:01.198 --> 00:07:04.934\nin the most natural conditions\nwe'll ever find,\n\n00:07:04.958 --> 00:07:06.798\nvery much free of threats.\n\n00:07:08.238 --> 00:07:12.934\nIn the Pantanal, besides the GPS collars,\nwe are using another technique:\n\n00:07:12.958 --> 00:07:14.174\ncamera traps.\n\n00:07:14.198 --> 00:07:17.094\nThis camera is equipped\nwith a movement sensor\n\n00:07:17.118 --> 00:07:20.134\nand it photographs animals\nwhen they walk in front of it.\n\n00:07:20.158 --> 00:07:22.614\nSo thanks to these amazing devices,\n\n00:07:22.638 --> 00:07:25.854\nwe have been able\nto gather precious information\n\n00:07:25.878 --> 00:07:28.814\nabout tapir reproduction\nand social organization\n\n00:07:28.838 --> 00:07:31.374\nwhich are very important\npieces of the puzzle\n\n00:07:31.398 --> 00:07:35.494\nwhen you're trying to develop\nthose conservation strategies.\n\n00:07:35.518 --> 00:07:40.214\nAnd right now, 2015,\nwe are expanding our work once again\n\n00:07:40.238 --> 00:07:42.094\nto the Brazilian Cerrado,\n\n00:07:42.118 --> 00:07:46.294\nthe open grasslands and shrub forests\nin the central part of Brazil.\n\n00:07:46.318 --> 00:07:53.214\nToday this region is the very epicenter\nof economic development in my country,\n\n00:07:53.238 --> 00:07:55.934\nwhere natural habitat\nand wildlife populations\n\n00:07:55.958 --> 00:08:00.054\nare rapidly being eradicated\nby several different threats,\n\n00:08:00.078 --> 00:08:02.654\nincluding once again cattle ranching,\n\n00:08:02.678 --> 00:08:05.414\nlarge sugarcane and soybean plantations,\n\n00:08:05.438 --> 00:08:08.934\npoaching, roadkill, just to name a few.\n\n00:08:08.958 --> 00:08:12.574\nAnd somehow, tapirs are still there,\n\n00:08:12.598 --> 00:08:15.014\nwhich gives me a lot of hope.\n\n00:08:15.038 --> 00:08:19.534\nBut I have to say that starting\nthis new program in the Cerrado\n\n00:08:19.558 --> 00:08:22.414\nwas a bit of a slap in the face.\n\n00:08:22.438 --> 00:08:23.894\nWhen you drive around\n\n00:08:23.918 --> 00:08:27.734\nand you find dead tapirs\nalong the highways\n\n00:08:27.758 --> 00:08:32.774\nand signs of tapirs wandering around\nin the middle of sugarcane plantations\n\n00:08:32.798 --> 00:08:34.814\nwhere they shouldn't be,\n\n00:08:34.838 --> 00:08:39.054\nand you talk to kids and they tell you\nthat they know how tapir meat tastes\n\n00:08:39.078 --> 00:08:42.454\nbecause their families poach and eat them,\n\n00:08:42.478 --> 00:08:44.718\nit really breaks your heart.\n\n00:08:45.997 --> 00:08:49.214\nThe situation in the Cerrado\nmade me realize --\n\n00:08:49.238 --> 00:08:52.174\nit gave me the sense of urgency.\n\n00:08:52.198 --> 00:08:54.493\nI am swimming against the tide.\n\n00:08:54.517 --> 00:08:58.174\nIt made me realize that despite\ntwo decades of hard work\n\n00:08:58.198 --> 00:09:01.734\ntrying to save these animals,\nwe still have so much work to do\n\n00:09:01.758 --> 00:09:04.814\nif we are to prevent them\nfrom disappearing.\n\n00:09:04.838 --> 00:09:08.774\nWe have to find ways\nto solve all these problems.\n\n00:09:08.798 --> 00:09:10.654\nWe really do, and you know what?\n\n00:09:10.678 --> 00:09:14.094\nWe really came to a point\nin the conservation world\n\n00:09:14.118 --> 00:09:16.854\nwhere we have to think out of the box.\n\n00:09:16.878 --> 00:09:20.614\nWe'll have to be a lot more creative\nthan we are right now.\n\n00:09:20.638 --> 00:09:24.534\nAnd I told you, roadkill is a big problem\nfor tapirs in the Cerrado,\n\n00:09:24.558 --> 00:09:27.974\nso we just came up with the idea\nof putting reflective stickers\n\n00:09:27.998 --> 00:09:30.814\non the GPS collars we put on the tapirs.\n\n00:09:30.838 --> 00:09:33.174\nThese are the same stickers\nused on big trucks\n\n00:09:33.198 --> 00:09:34.814\nto avoid collision.\n\n00:09:34.838 --> 00:09:38.054\nTapirs cross the highways after dark,\n\n00:09:38.078 --> 00:09:43.254\nso the stickers will hopefully\nhelp drivers see this

Meet the new Li-Fi Internet", "duration": "444", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/harald_haas_a_breakthrough_new_kind_of_wireless_internet", "transcript": "I would like to demonstrate for the first time in public that it is possible to transmit a video from a standard off-the-shelf LED lamp to a solar cell with a laptop acting as a receiver. There is no Wi-Fi involved, it's just light.And you may wonder, what's the point? And the point is this: There will be a massive extension of the Internet to close the digital divide, and also to allow for what we call \"The Internet of Things\" \u2014 tens of billions of devices connected to the Internet.In my view, such an extension of the Internet can only work if it's almost energy-neutral. This means we need to use existing infrastructure as much as possible. And this is where the solar cell and the LED come in.I demonstrated for the first time, at TED in 2011, Li-Fi, or Light Fidelity. Li-Fi uses off-the-shelf LEDs to transmit data incredibly fast, and also in a safe and secure manner. Data is transported by the light, encoded in subtle changes of the brightness. If we look around, we have many LEDs around us, so there's a rich infrastructure of Li-Fi transmitters around us. But so far, we have been using special devices \u2014 small photo detectors, to receive the information encoded in the data. I wanted to find a way to also use existing infrastructure to receive data from our Li-Fi lights. And this is why I have been looking into solar cells and solar panels.A solar cell absorbs light and converts it into electrical energy. This is why we can use a solar cell to charge our mobile phone. But now we need to remember that the data is encoded in subtle changes of the brightness of the LED, so if the incoming light fluctuates, so does the energy harvested from the solar cell. This means we have a principal mechanism in place to receive information from the light and by the solar cell, because the fluctuations of the energy harvested correspond to the data transmitted.Of course the question is: can we receive very fast and subtle changes of the brightness, such as the ones transmitted by our LED lights? And the answer to that is yes, we can. We have shown in the lab that we can receive up to 50 megabytes per second from a standard, off-the-shelf solar cell. And this is faster than most broadband connections these days.Now let me show you in practice. In this box is a standard, off-the-shelf LED lamp. This is a standard, off-the-shelf solar cell; it is connected to the laptop. And also we have an instrument here to visualize the energy we harvest from the solar cell. And this instrument shows something at the moment. This is because the solar cell already harvests light from the ambient light.Now what I would like to do first is switch on the light, and I'll simply, only switch on the light, for a moment, and what you'll notice is that the instrument jumps to the right. So the solar cell, for a moment, is harvesting energy from this artificial light source. If I turn it off, we see it drops. I turn it on ... So we harvest energy with the solar cell.But next I would like to activate the streaming of the video. And I've done this by pressing this button. So now this LED lamp here is streaming a video by changing the brightness of the LED in a very subtle way, and in a way that you can't recognize with your eye, because the changes are too fast to recognize. But in order to prove the point, I can block the light of the solar cell. So first you notice the energy harvesting drops and the video stops as well. If I remove the blockage, the video will restart.(Applause)And I can repeat that. So we stop the transmission of the video and energy harvesting stops as well. So that is to show that the solar cell acts as a receiver.But now imagine that this LED lamp is a street light, and there's fog. And so I want to simulate fog, and that's why I brought a handkerchief with me.(Laughter)And let me put the handkerchief over the solar cell. First you notice the energy harvested drops, as expected, but now the video still continues. This means, despite the blockage, there's sufficient light coming through the handkerchief to the solar cell, so that the solar cell is able to decode and stream that information, in this case, a high-definition video.What's really important here is that a solar cell has become a receiver for high-speed wireless signals encoded in light, while it maintains its primary function as an energy-harvesting device. That's why it is possible to use existing solar cells on the roof of a hut to act as a broadband receiver from a laser station on a close by hill, or indeed, lamp post.And It really doesn't matter where the beam hits the solar cell. And the same is true for translucent solar cells integrated into windows, solar cells integrated into street furniture, or indeed, solar cells integrated into these billions of devices that will form the Internet of Things. Because simply, we don't want to charge these devices regularly, or worse, replace the batteries every few months.As I said to you, this is the first time I've shown this in public. It's very much a lab demonstration, a prototype. But my team and I are confident that we can take this to market within the next two to three years. And we hope we will be able to contribute to closing the digital divide, and also contribute to connecting all these billions of devices to the Internet. And all of this without causing a massive explosion of energy consumption \u2014 because of the solar cells, quite the opposite.Thank you.(Applause)", "id": 2368, "subtitle":

world", "duration": "710", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/jenni_chang_and_lisa_dazols_this_is_what_lgbt_life_is_like_around_the_world", "transcript": "Jenni Chang: When I told my parents I was gay, the first thing they said to me was, \"We're bringing you back to Taiwan.\"(Laughter)In their minds, my sexual orientation was America's fault. The West had corrupted me with divergent ideas, and if only my parents had never left Taiwan, this would not have happened to their only daughter. In truth, I wondered if they were right.Of course, there are gay people in Asia, just as there are gay people in every part of the world. But is the idea of living an \"out\" life, in the \"I'm gay, this is my spouse, and we're proud of our lives together\" kind of way just a Western idea?If I had grown up in Taiwan, or any place outside of the West, would I have found models of happy, thriving LGBT people?Lisa Dazols: I had similar notions. As an HIV social worker in San Francisco, I had met many gay immigrants. They told me their stories of persecution in their home countries, just for being gay, and the reasons why they escaped to the US. I saw how this had beaten them down. After 10 years of doing this kind of work, I needed better stories for myself. I knew the world was far from perfect, but surely not every gay story was tragic.JC: So as a couple, we both had a need to find stories of hope. So we set off on a mission to travel the world and look for the people we finally termed as the \"Supergays.\"(Laughter)These would be the LGBT individuals who were doing something extraordinary in the world. They would be courageous, resilient, and most of all, proud of who they were. They would be the kind of person that I aspire to be. Our plan was to share their stories to the world through film.LD: There was just one problem. We had zero reporting and zero filmmaking experience.(Laughter)We didn't even know where to find the Supergays, so we just had to trust that we'd figure it all out along the way. So we picked 15 countries in Asia, Africa and South America, countries outside the West that varied in terms of LGBT rights. We bought a camcorder, ordered a book on how to make a documentary \u2014(Laughter)you can learn a lot these days \u2014 and set off on an around-the-world trip.JC: One of the first countries that we traveled to was Nepal. Despite widespread poverty, a decade-long civil war, and now recently, a devastating earthquake, Nepal has made significant strides in the fight for equality. One of the key figures in the movement is Bhumika Shrestha. A beautiful, vibrant transgendered woman, Bhumika has had to overcome being expelled from school and getting incarcerated because of her gender presentation. But, in 2007, Bhumika and Nepal's LGBT rights organization successfully petitioned the Nepali Supreme Court to protect against LGBT discrimination.Here's Bhumika:(Video) BS: What I'm most proud of? I'm a transgendered person. I'm so proud of my life. On December 21, 2007, the supreme court gave the decision for the Nepal government to give transgender identity cards and same-sex marriage.LD: I can appreciate Bhumika's confidence on a daily basis. Something as simple as using a public restroom can be a huge challenge when you don't fit in to people's strict gender expectations. Traveling throughout Asia, I tended to freak out women in public restrooms. They weren't used to seeing someone like me. I had to come up with a strategy, so that I could just pee in peace.(Laughter)So anytime I would enter a restroom, I would thrust out my chest to show my womanly parts, and try to be as non-threatening as possible. Putting out my hands and saying, \"Hello\", just so that people could hear my feminine voice. This all gets pretty exhausting, but it's just who I am. I can't be anything else.JC: After Nepal, we traveled to India. On one hand, India is a Hindu society, without a tradition of homophobia. On the other hand, it is also a society with a deeply patriarchal system, which rejects anything that threatens the male-female order. When we spoke to activists, they told us that empowerment begins with ensuring proper gender equality, where the women's status is established in society. And in that way, the status of LGBT people can be affirmed as well.LD: There we met Prince Manvendra. He's the world's first openly gay prince. Prince Manvendra came out on the \"Oprah Winfrey Show,\" very internationally. His parents disowned him and accused him of bringing great shame to the royal family. We sat down with Prince Manvendra and talked to him about why he decided to come out so very publicly.Here he is:(Video) Prince Manvendra:  I felt there was a lot of need to break this stigma and discrimination which is existing in our society. And that instigated me to come out openly and talk about myself. Whether we are gay, we are lesbian, we are transgender, bisexual or whatever sexual minority we come from, we have to all unite and fight for our rights. Gay rights cannot be won in the court rooms, but in the hearts and the minds of the people.JC: While getting my hair cut, the woman cutting my hair asked me, \"Do you have a husband?\" Now, this was a dreaded question that I got asked a lot by locals while traveling. When I explained to her that I was with a woman instead of a man, she was incredulous, and she asked me a lot of questions about my parents' reactions and whether I was sad that I'd never be able to have children. I told her that there are no limitations to my life and that Lisa and I do plan to have a family some day. Now, this woman was ready to write me off as yet another crazy Westerner. She couldn't imagine that such a phenomenon could happen in her own country. That is, until I showed her the photos of the Supergays that we interviewed in India. She recognized Prince Manvendra from television and soon I had an audience of other hairdressers interested in meeting me.(Laughter)And in that ordinary afternoon, I had the chance to introduce an entire beauty salon to the social changes that were happening in their own country.LD: From India, we traveled to East Africa, a region known for intolerance towards LGBT people. In Kenya, 89 percent of people who come out to their families are disowned. Homosexual acts are a crime and can lead to incarceration. In Kenya, we met the soft-spoken David Kuria. David had a huge mission of wanting to work for the poor and improve his own government. So he decided to run for senate. He became Kenya's first openly gay political candidate. David wanted to run his campaign without denying the reality of who he was. But we were worried for his safety because he started to receive death threats.(Video) David Kuria:  At that point, I was really scared because they were actually asking for me to be killed. And, yeah, there are some people out there who do it and they feel that they are doing a religious obligation.JC: David wasn't ashamed of who he was. Even in the face of threats, he stayed authentic.LD: At the opposite end of the spectrum is Argentina. Argentina's a country where 92 percent of the population identifies as Catholic. Yet, Argentina has LGBT laws that are even more progressive than here in the US. In 2010, Argentina became the first country in Latin America and the 10th in the world to adopt marriage equality.There, we met Mar\u00eda Rachid. Mar\u00eda was a driving force behind that movement.Mar\u00eda Rachid (Spanish): I always say that, in reality, the effects of marriage equality are not only for those couples that get married. They are for a lot of people that, even though they may never get married, will be perceived differently by their coworkers, their families and neighbors, from the national state's message of equality. I feel very proud of Argentina because Argentina today is a model of equality. And hopefully soon, the whole world will have the same rights.JC: When we made the visit to my ancestral lands, I wish I could have shown my parents what we found there. Because here is who we met:(Video) One, two, three. Welcome gays to Shanghai!(Laughter)A whole community of young, beautiful Chinese LGBT people. Sure, they had their struggles. But they were fighting it out. In Shanghai, I had the chance to speak to a local lesbian group and tell them our story in my broken Mandarin Chinese. In Taipei, each time we got onto the metro, we saw yet another lesbian couple holding hands. And we learned that Asia's largest LGBT pride event happens just blocks away from where my grandparents live. If only my parents knew.LD: By the time we finished our not-so-straight journey around the world,(Laughter)we had traveled 50,000 miles and logged 120 hours of video footage. We traveled to 15 countries and interviewed 50 Supergays. Turns out, it wasn't hard to find them at all.JC: Yes, there are still tragedies that happen on the bumpy road to equality. And let's not forget that 75 countries still criminalize homosexuality today. But there are also stories of hope and courage in every corner of the world. What we ultimately took away from our journey is, equality is not a Western invention.LD: One of the key factors in this equality movement is momentum, momentum as more and more people embrace their full selves and use whatever opportunities they have to change their part of the world, and momentum as more and more countries find models of equality in one another. When Nepal protected against LGBT discrimination, India pushed harder. When Argentina embraced marriage equality, Uruguay and Brazil followed. When Ireland said yes to equality,(Applause)the world stopped to notice. When the US Supreme Court makes a statement to the world that we can all be proud of.(Applause)JC: As we reviewed our footage, what we realized is that we were watching a love story. It wasn't a love story that was expected of me, but it is one filled with more freedom, adventure and love than I could have ever possibly imagined. One year after returning home from our trip, marriage equality came to California. And in the end, we believe, love will win out.(Video) By the power vested in me, by the state of California and by God Almighty, I now pronounce you spouses for life. You may kiss.(Applause)", "id": 2370, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:12.518 --> 00:00:14.814\nJenni Chang: When I told\nmy parents I was

bias behind your search results", "duration": "558", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/andreas_ekstrom_the_moral_bias_behind_your_search_results", "transcript": "So whenever I visit a school and talk to students, I always ask them the same thing: Why do you Google? Why is Google the search engine of choice for you? Strangely enough, I always get the same three answers. One, \"Because it works,\" which is a great answer; that's why I Google, too. Two, somebody will say, \"I really don't know of any alternatives.\" It's not an equally great answer and my reply to that is usually, \"Try to Google the word 'search engine,' you may find a couple of interesting alternatives.\" And last but not least, thirdly, inevitably, one student will raise her or his hand and say, \"With Google, I'm certain to always get the best, unbiased search result.\" Certain to always get the best, unbiased search result.Now, as a man of the humanities, albeit a digital humanities man, that just makes my skin curl, even if I, too, realize that that trust, that idea of the unbiased search result is a cornerstone in our collective love for and appreciation of Google. I will show you why that, philosophically, is almost an impossibility.But let me first elaborate, just a little bit, on a basic principle behind each search query that we sometimes seem to forget. So whenever you set out to Google something, start by asking yourself this: \"Am I looking for an isolated fact?\" What is the capital of France? What are the building blocks of a water molecule? Great \u2014 Google away. There's not a group of scientists who are this close to proving that it's actually London and H30. You don't see a big conspiracy among those things. We agree, on a global scale, what the answers are to these isolated facts.But if you complicate your question just a little bit and ask something like, \"Why is there an Israeli-Palestine conflict?\" You're not exactly looking for a singular fact anymore, you're looking for knowledge, which is something way more complicated and delicate. And to get to knowledge, you have to bring 10 or 20 or 100 facts to the table and acknowledge them and say, \"Yes, these are all true.\" But because of who I am, young or old, black or white, gay or straight, I will value them differently. And I will say, \"Yes, this is true, but this is more important to me than that.\" And this is where it becomes interesting, because this is where we become human. This is when we start to argue, to form society. And to really get somewhere, we need to filter all our facts here, through friends and neighbors and parents and children and coworkers and newspapers and magazines, to finally be grounded in real knowledge, which is something that a search engine is a poor help to achieve.So, I promised you an example just to show you why it's so hard to get to the point of true, clean, objective knowledge \u2014 as food for thought. I will conduct a couple of simple queries, search queries. We'll start with \"Michelle Obama,\" the First Lady of the United States. And we'll click for pictures. It works really well, as you can see. It's a perfect search result, more or less. It's just her in the picture, not even the President.How does this work? Quite simple. Google uses a lot of smartness to achieve this, but quite simply, they look at two things more than anything. First, what does it say in the caption under the picture on each website? Does it say \"Michelle Obama\" under the picture? Pretty good indication it's actually her on there. Second, Google looks at the picture file, the name of the file as such uploaded to the website. Again, is it called \"MichelleObama.jpeg\"? Pretty good indication it's not Clint Eastwood in the picture. So, you've got those two and you get a search result like this \u2014 almost.Now, in 2009, Michelle Obama was the victim of a racist campaign, where people set out to insult her through her search results. There was a picture distributed widely over the Internet where her face was distorted to look like a monkey. And that picture was published all over. And people published it very, very purposefully, to get it up there in the search results. They made sure to write \"Michelle Obama\" in the caption and they made sure to upload the picture as \"MichelleObama.jpeg,\" or the like. You get why \u2014 to manipulate the search result. And it worked, too. So when you picture-Googled for \"Michelle Obama\" in 2009, that distorted monkey picture showed up among the first results.Now, the results are self-cleansing, and that's sort of the beauty of it, because Google measures relevance every hour, every day. However, Google didn't settle for that this time, they just thought, \"That's racist and it's a bad search result and we're going to go back and clean that up manually. We are going to write some code and fix it,\" which they did. And I don't think anyone in this room thinks that was a bad idea. Me neither.But then, a couple of years go by, and the world's most-Googled Anders, Anders Behring Breivik, did what he did. This is July 22 in 2011, and a terrible day in Norwegian history. This man, a terrorist, blew up a couple of government buildings walking distance from where we are right now in Oslo, Norway and then he traveled to the island of Ut\u00f8ya and shot and killed a group of kids. Almost 80 people died that day.And a lot of people would describe this act of terror as two steps, that he did two things: he blew up the buildings and he shot those kids. It's not true. It was three steps. He blew up those buildings, he shot those kids, and he sat down and waited for the world to Google him. And he prepared all three steps equally well.And if there was somebody who immediately understood this, it was a Swedish web developer, a search engine optimization expert in Stockholm, named Nikke Lindqvist. He's also a very political guy and he was right out there in social media, on his blog and Facebook. And he told everybody, \"If there's something that this guy wants right now, it's to control the image of himself. Let's see if we can distort that. Let's see if we, in the civilized world, can protest against what he did through insulting him in his search results.\"And how? He told all of his readers the following, \"Go out there on the Internet, find pictures of dog poop on sidewalks \u2014 find pictures of dog poop on sidewalks \u2014 publish them in your feeds, on your websites, on your blogs. Make sure to write the terrorist's name in the caption, make sure to name the picture file \"Breivik.jpeg.\" Let's teach Google that that's the face of the terrorist.\" And it worked. Two years after that campaign against Michelle Obama, this manipulation campaign against Anders Behring Breivik worked. If you picture-Googled for him weeks after the July 22 events from Sweden, you'd see that picture of dog poop high up in the search results, as a little protest.Strangely enough, Google didn't intervene this time. They did not step in and manually clean those search results up. So the million-dollar question, is there anything different between these two happenings here? Is there anything different between what happened to Michelle Obama and what happened to Anders Behring Breivik? Of course not. It's the exact same thing, yet Google intervened in one case and not in the other.Why? Because Michelle Obama is an honorable person, that's why, and Anders Behring Breivik is a despicable person. See what happens there? An evaluation of a person takes place and there's only one power-player in the world with the authority to say who's who. \"We like you, we dislike you. We believe in you, we don't believe in you. You're right, you're wrong. You're true, you're false. You're Obama, and you're Breivik.\" That's power if I ever saw it.So I'm asking you to remember that behind every algorithm is always a person, a person with a set of personal beliefs that no code can ever completely eradicate. And my message goes out not only to Google, but to all believers in the faith of code around the world. You need to identify your own personal bias. You need to understand that you are human and take responsibility accordingly.And I say this because I believe we've reached a point in time when it's absolutely imperative that we tie those bonds together again, tighter: the humanities and the technology. Tighter than ever. And, if nothing else, to remind us that that wonderfully seductive idea of the unbiased, clean search result is, and is likely to remain, a myth.Thank you for your time.(Applause)", "id": 2369,

elaborate,\njust a little bit, on a basic principle\n\n00:01:28.176 --> 00:01:31.289\nbehind each search query\nthat we sometimes seem to forget.\n\n00:01:31.809 --> 00:01:33.889\nSo whenever you set out\nto Google something,\n\n00:01:33.913 --> 00:01:37.840\nstart by asking yourself this:\n\"Am I looking for an isolated fact?\"\n\n00:01:38.292 --> 00:01:41.453\nWhat is the capital of France?\n\n00:01:41.477 --> 00:01:43.902\nWhat are the building blocks\nof a water molecule?\n\n00:01:43.926 --> 00:01:46.267\nGreat -- Google away.\n\n00:01:46.291 --> 00:01:49.411\nThere's not a group of scientists\nwho are this close to proving\n\n00:01:49.435 --> 00:01:51.432\nthat it's actually London and H30.\n\n00:01:51.456 --> 00:01:53.827\nYou don't see a big conspiracy\namong those things.\n\n00:01:53.851 --> 00:01:55.384\nWe agree, on a global scale,\n\n00:01:55.408 --> 00:01:58.133\nwhat the answers are\nto these isolated facts.\n\n00:01:58.157 --> 00:02:03.459\nBut if you complicate your question\njust a little bit and ask something like,\n\n00:02:03.483 --> 00:02:06.166\n\"Why is there\nan Israeli-Palestine conflict?\"\n\n00:02:06.936 --> 00:02:09.576\nYou're not exactly looking\nfor a singular fact anymore,\n\n00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:11.433\nyou're looking for knowledge,\n\n00:02:11.457 --> 00:02:14.035\nwhich is something way more\ncomplicated and delicate.\n\n00:02:14.558 --> 00:02:16.107\nAnd to get to knowledge,\n\n00:02:16.131 --> 00:02:19.162\nyou have to bring 10 or 20\nor 100 facts to the table\n\n00:02:19.186 --> 00:02:22.162\nand acknowledge them and say,\n\"Yes, these are all true.\"\n\n00:02:22.186 --> 00:02:23.860\nBut because of who I am,\n\n00:02:23.884 --> 00:02:26.154\nyoung or old, black or white,\ngay or straight,\n\n00:02:26.178 --> 00:02:27.789\nI will value them differently.\n\n00:02:27.813 --> 00:02:29.501\nAnd I will say, \"Yes, this is true,\n\n00:02:29.525 --> 00:02:31.639\nbut this is more important\nto me than that.\"\n\n00:02:31.663 --> 00:02:33.653\nAnd this is where it becomes interesting,\n\n00:02:33.677 --> 00:02:35.823\nbecause this is where we become human.\n\n00:02:35.847 --> 00:02:38.843\nThis is when we start\nto argue, to form society.\n\n00:02:38.867 --> 00:02:42.224\nAnd to really get somewhere,\nwe need to filter all our facts here,\n\n00:02:42.248 --> 00:02:44.804\nthrough friends and neighbors\nand parents and children\n\n00:02:44.828 --> 00:02:46.860\nand coworkers and newspapers\nand magazines,\n\n00:02:46.884 --> 00:02:49.964\nto finally be grounded in real knowledge,\n\n00:02:49.988 --> 00:02:54.035\nwhich is something that a search engine\nis a poor help to achieve.\n\n00:02:55.242 --> 00:03:01.570\nSo, I promised you an example\njust to show you why it's so hard\n\n00:03:01.594 --> 00:03:04.998\nto get to the point of true, clean,\nobjective knowledge --\n\n00:03:05.022 --> 00:03:06.490\nas food for thought.\n\n00:03:06.514 --> 00:03:10.407\nI will conduct a couple of simple\nqueries, search queries.\n\n00:03:10.431 --> 00:03:14.471\nWe'll start with \"Michelle Obama,\"\n\n00:03:14.495 --> 00:03:16.299\nthe First Lady of the United States.\n\n00:03:16.323 --> 00:03:18.052\nAnd we'll click for pictures.\n\n00:03:18.965 --> 00:03:21.237\nIt works really well, as you can see.\n\n00:03:21.261 --> 00:03:24.289\nIt's a perfect search\nresult, more or less.\n\n00:03:24.313 --> 00:03:27.063\nIt's just her in the picture,\nnot even the President.\n\n00:03:27.622 --> 00:03:28.935\nHow does this work?\n\n00:03:29.795 --> 00:03:31.167\nQuite simple.\n\n00:03:31.191 --> 00:03:34.406\nGoogle uses a lot of smartness\nto achieve this, but quite simply,\n\n00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:36.490\nthey look at two things\nmore than anything.\n\n00:03:36.514 --> 00:03:41.670\nFirst, what does it say in the caption\nunder the picture on each website?\n\n00:03:41.694 --> 00:03:43.909\nDoes it say \"Michelle Obama\"\nunder the picture?\n\n00:03:43.933 --> 00:03:46.289\nPretty good indication\nit's actually her on there.\n\n00:03:46.313 --> 00:03:48.699\nSecond, Google looks at the picture file,\n\n00:03:48.723 --> 00:03:51.755\nthe name of the file as such\nuploaded to the website.\n\n00:03:51.779 --> 00:03:54.448\nAgain, is it called \"MichelleObama.jpeg\"?\n\n00:03:54.797 --> 00:03:57.719\nPretty good indication it's not\nClint Eastwood in the picture.\n\n00:03:57.743 --> 00:04:02.008\nSo, you've got those two and you get\na search result like this -- almost.\n\n00:04:02.032 --> 00:04:08.635\nNow, in 2009, Michelle Obama\nwas the victim of a racist campaign,\n\n00:04:08.659 --> 00:04:12.674\nwhere people set out to insult her\nthrough her search results.\n\n00:04:13.388 --> 00:04:16.090\nThere was a picture distributed\nwidely over the Internet\n\n00:04:16.114 --> 00:04:18.758\nwhere her face was distorted\nto look like a monkey.\n\n00:04:18.782 --> 00:04:21.951\nAnd that picture was published all over.\n\n00:04:21.975 --> 00:04:25.736\nAnd people published it\nvery, very purposefully,\n\n00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:27.731\nto get it up there in the search results.\n\n00:04:27.755 --> 00:04:30.710\nThey made sure to write\n\"Michelle Obama\" in the caption\n\n00:04:30.734 --> 00:04:34.911\nand they made sure to upload the picture\nas \"MichelleObama.jpeg,\" or the like.\n\n00:04:34.935 --> 00:04:37.302\nYou get why -- to manipulate\nthe search result.\n\n00:04:37.326 --> 00:04:38.621\nAnd it worked, too.\n\n00:04:38.645 --> 00:04:41.365\nSo when you picture-Googled\nfor \"Michelle Obama\" in 2009,\n\n00:04:41.389 --> 00:04:44.776\nthat distorted monkey picture\nshowed up among the first results.\n\n00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:48.366\nNow, the results are self-cleansing,\n\n00:04:48.390 --> 00:04:50.143\nand that's sort of the beauty of it,\n\n00:04:50.167 --> 00:04:53.570\nbecause Google measures relevance\nevery hour, every day.\n\n00:04:53.594 --> 00:04:56.308\nHowever, Google didn't settle\nfor that this time,\n\n00:04:56.332 --> 00:04:59.456\nthey just thought, \"That's racist\nand it's a bad search result\n\n00:04:59.480 --> 00:05:02.615\nand we're going to go back\nand clean that up manually.\n\n00:05:02.639 --> 00:05:05.571\nWe are going to write\nsome code and fix it,\"\n\n00:05:05.595 --> 00:05:06.842\nwhich they did.\n\n00:05:07.412 --> 00:05:11.154\nAnd I don't think anyone in this room\nthinks that was a bad idea.\n\n00:05:11.747 --> 00:05:12.911\nMe neither.\n\n00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:17.792\nBut then, a couple of years go by,\n\n00:05:17.816 --> 00:05:20.800\nand the world's most-Googled Anders,\n\n00:05:20.824 --> 00:05:23.103\nAnders Behring Breivik,\n\n00:05:23.127 --> 00:05:24.833\ndid what he did.\n\n00:05:24.857 --> 00:05:26.858\nThis is July 22 in 2011,\n\n00:05:26.882 --> 00:05:29.531\nand a terrible day in Norwegian history.\n\n00:05:29.555 --> 00:05:33.342\nThis man, a terrorist, blew up\na couple of government buildings\n\n00:05:33.366 --> 00:05:36.249\nwalking distance from where we are\nright now in Oslo, Norway\n\n00:05:36.273 --> 00:05:38.324\nand then he traveled\nto the island of Ut\u00f8ya\n\n00:05:38.348 --> 00:05:40.571\nand shot and killed a group of kids.\n\n00:05:41.071 --> 00:05:42.799\nAlmost 80 people died that day.\n\n00:05:44.355 --> 00:05:48.914\nAnd a lot of people would describe\nthis act of terror as two steps,\n\n00:05:48.938 --> 00:05:52.349\nthat he did two things: he blew up\nthe buildings and he shot those kids.\n\n00:05:52.373 --> 00:05:53.538\nIt's not true.\n\n00:05:54.284 --> 00:05:56.427\nIt was three steps.\n\n00:05:56.451 --> 00:05:58.665\nHe blew up those buildings,\nhe shot those kids,\n\n00:05:58.689 --> 00:06:02.333\nand he sat down and waited\nfor the world to Google him.\n\n00:06:03.185 --> 00:06:05.812\nAnd he prepared\nall three steps equally well.\n\n00:06:06.502 --> 00:06:09.292\nAnd if there was somebody\nwho immediately understood this,\n\n00:06:09.316 --> 00:06:10.840\nit was a Swedish web developer,\n\n00:06:10.864 --> 00:06:14.487\na search engine optimization expert\nin Stockholm, named Nikke Lindqvist.\n\n00:06:14.511 --> 00:06:16.099\nHe's also a very political guy\n\n00:06:16.123 --> 00:06:19.399\nand he was right out there\nin social media, on his blog and Facebook.\n\n00:06:19.423 --> 00:06:20.629\nAnd he told everybody,\n\n00:06:20.653 --> 00:06:23.108\n\"If there's something that\nthis guy wants right now,\n\n00:06:23.132 --> 00:06:25.591\nit's to control the image of himself.\n\n00:06:26.718 --> 00:06:28.678\nLet's see if we can distort that.\n\n00:06:29.448 --> 00:06:33.425\nLet's see if we, in the civilized world,\ncan protest against what he did\n\n00:06:33.449 --> 00:06:36.766\nthrough insulting him\nin his search results.\"\n\n00:06:36.790 --> 00:06:37.977\nAnd how?\n\n00:06:38.755 --> 00:06:40.811\nHe told all of his readers the following,\n\n00:06:40.835 --> 00:06:42.699\n\"Go out there on the Internet,\n\n00:06:42.723 --> 00:06:45.618\nfind pictures of dog poop on sidewalks --\n\n00:06:46.666 --> 00:06:48.840\nfind pictures of dog poop on sidewalks --\n\n00:06:48.864 --> 00:06:52.334\npublish them in your feeds,\non your websites, on your blogs.\n\n00:06:52.358 --> 00:06:55.279\nMake sure to write the terrorist's\nname in the caption,\n\n00:06:55.303 --> 00:06:59.790\nmake sure to name\nthe picture file \"Breivik.jpeg.\"\n\n00:06:59.814 --> 00:07:03.615\nLet's teach Google that that's\nthe face of the terrorist.\"\n\n00:07:05.510 --> 00:07:06.788\nAnd it worked.\n\n00:07:07.811 --> 00:07:10.709\nTwo years after that campaign\nagainst Michelle Obama,\n\n00:07:10.733 --> 00:07:13.999\nthis manipulation campaign\nagainst Anders Behring Breivik worked.\n\n00:07:14.023 --> 00:07:18.485\nIf you picture-Googled for him weeks after\nthe July 22 events from Sweden,\n\n00:07:18.509 --> 00:07:22.836\nyou'd see that picture of dog poop\nhigh up in the search results,\n\n00:07:22.860 --> 00:07:24.304\nas a little protest.\n\n00:07:25.383 --> 00:07:29.515\nStrangely enough, Google\ndidn't intervene this time.\n\n00:07:30.452 --> 00:07:34.724\nThey did not step in and manually\nclean those search results up.\n\n00:07:35.922 --> 00:07:37.638\nSo the million-dollar question,\n\n00:07:37.662 --> 00:07:41.030\nis there anything different\nbetween these two happenings here?\n\n00:07:41.054 --> 00:07:44.247\nIs there anything different between\nwhat happened to Michelle Obama\n\n00:07:44.271 --> 00:07:46.336\nand what happened\nto Anders Behring Breivik?\n\n00:07:46.360 --> 00:07:47.644\nOf course not.\n\n00:07:48.819 --> 00:07:50.290\nIt's the exact same thing,\n\n00:07:50.314 --> 00:07:53.178\nyet Google intervened in one case\nand not in the other.\n\n00:07:53.202 --> 00:07:54.455\nWhy?\n\n00:07:55.241 --> 00:07:58.541\nBecause Michelle Obama\nis an honorable person, that's why,\n\n00:07:58.565 --> 00:08:01.481\nand Anders Behring Breivik\nis a despicable person.\n\n00:08:02.100 --> 00:08:03.635\nSee what happens there?\n\n00:08:03.659 --> 00:08:06.914\nAn evaluation of a person takes place\n\n00:08:06.938 --> 00:08:10.724\nand there's only one\npower-player in the world\n\n00:08:10.748 --> 00:08:13.228\nwith the authority to say who's who.\n\n00:08:13.840 --> 00:08:15.581\n\"We like you, we dislike you.\n\n00:08:15.605 --> 00:08:17.644\nWe believe in you,\nwe don't believe in you.\n\n00:08:17.668 --> 00:08:20.215\nYou're right, you're wrong.\nYou're true, you're false.\n\n00:08:20.239 --> 00:08:22.044\nYou're Obama, and you're Breivik.\"\n\n00:08:22.749 --> 00:08:24.749\nThat's power if I ever saw it.\n\n00:08:27.164 --> 00:08:30.816\nSo I'm asking you to remember\nthat behind every algorithm\n\n00:08:30.840 --> 00:08:32.617\nis always a person,\n\n00:08:32.641 --> 00:08:35.136\na person with a set of personal beliefs\n\n00:08:35.160 --> 00:08:37.685\nthat no code can ever\ncompletely eradicate.\n\n00:08:37.709 --> 00:08:40.143\nAnd my message goes\nout not only to Google,\n\n00:08:40.167 --> 00:08:42.977\nbut to all believers in the faith\nof code around the world.\n\n00:08:43.001 --> 00:08:45.977\nYou need to identify\nyour own personal bias.\n\n00:08:46.001 --> 00:08:48.014\nYou need to understand that you are human\n\n00:08:48.038 --> 00:08:50.529\nand take responsibility accordingly.\n\n00:08:51.849 --> 00:08:54.787\nAnd I say this because I believe\nwe've reached a point in time\n\n00:08:54.811 --> 00:08:56.366\nwhen it's absolutely imperative\n\n00:08:56.390 --> 00:08:59.607\nthat we tie those bonds\ntogether again, tighter:\n\n00:08:59.631 --> 00:09:01.999\nthe humanities and the technology.\n\n00:09:02.441 --> 00:09:04.246\nTighter than ever.\n\n00:09:04.270 --> 00:09:07.609\nAnd, if nothing else, to remind us\nthat that wonderfully seductive idea\n\n00:09:07.633 --> 00:09:10.301\nof the unbiased, clean search result\n\n00:09:10.325 --> 00:09:13.092\nis, and is likely to remain, a myth.\n\n00:09:13.942 --> 00:09:15.101\nThank you for your time.\n\n00:09:15.125 --> 00:09:17.557\n(Applause)"}, {"title": "How I'm working for change inside my church", "duration": "756", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/chelsea_shields_how_i_m_working_for_change_inside_my_church", "transcript": "Religion is more than belief. It's power, and it's influence. And that influence affects all of us, every day, regardless of your own belief. Despite the enormous influence of religion on the world today, we hold them to a different standard of scrutiny and accountability than any other sector of our society. For example, if there were a multinational organization, government or corporation today that said no female could be on a leadership board, not one woman could have a decision-making authority, not one woman could handle any financial matter, we would have outrage. There would be sanctions. And yet this is a common practice in almost every world religion today.We accept things in our religious lives that we do not accept in our secular lives, and I know this because I've been doing it for three decades. I was the type of girl that fought every form of gender discrimination growing up. I played pickup basketball games with the boys and inserted myself. I said I was going to be the first female President of the United States. I have been fighting for the Equal Rights Amendment, which has been dead for 40 years. I'm the first woman in both sides of my family to ever work outside the home and ever receive a higher education.I never accepted being excluded because I was a woman, except in my religion. Throughout all of that time, I was a part of a very patriarchal orthodox Mormon religion. I grew up in an enormously traditional family. I have eight siblings, a stay-at-home mother. My father's actually a religious leader in the community. And I grew up in a world believing that my worth and my standing was in keeping these rules that I'd known my whole life. You get married a virgin, you never drink alcohol, you don't smoke, you always do service, you're a good kid. Some of the rules we had were strict, but you followed the rules because you loved the people and you loved the religion and you believed.Everything about Mormonism determined what you wore, who you dated, who you married. It determined what underwear we wore. I was the kind of religious where everyone I know donated 10 percent of everything they earned to the church, including myself. From paper routes and babysitting, I donated 10 percent. I was the kind of religious where I heard parents tell children when they're leaving on a two-year proselytizing mission that they would rather have them die than return home without honor, having sinned. I was the type and the kind of religious where kids kill themselves every single year because they're terrified of coming out to our community as gay. But I was also the kind of religious where it didn't matter where in the world I lived, I had friendship, instantaneous mutual aid. This was where I felt safe. This is certainty and clarity about life. I had help raising my little daughter. So that's why I accepted without question that only men can lead, and I accepted without question that women can't have the spiritual authority of God on the Earth, which we call the priesthood. And I allowed discrepancies between men and women in operating budgets, disciplinary councils, in decision-making capacities, and I gave my religion a free pass because I loved it.Until I stopped, and I realized that I had been allowing myself to be treated as the support staff to the real work of men. And I faced this contradiction in myself, and I joined with other activists in my community. We've been working very, very, very hard for the last decade and more.The first thing we did was raise consciousness. You can't change what you can't see. We started podcasting, blogging, writing articles. I created lists of hundreds of ways that men and women are unequal in our community.The next thing we did was build advocacy organizations. We tried to do things that were unignorable, like wearing pants to church and trying to attend all-male meetings. These seem like simple things, but to us, the organizers, they were enormously costly. We lost relationships. We lost jobs. We got hate mail on a daily basis. We were attacked in social media and national press. We received death threats. We lost standing in our community. Some of us got excommunicated. Most of us got put in front of a disciplinary council, and were rejected from the communities that we loved because we wanted to make them better, because we believed that they could be.And I began to expect this reaction from my own people. I know what it feels like when you feel like someone's trying to change you or criticize you. But what utterly shocked me was throughout all of this work I received equal measures of vitriol from the secular left, the same vehemence as the religious right. And what my secular friends didn't realize was that this religious hostility, these phrases of, \"Oh, all religious people are crazy or stupid.\" \"Don't pay attention to religion.\" \"They're going to be homophobic and sexist.\" What they didn't understand was that that type of hostility did not fight religious extremism, it bred religious extremism. Those arguments don't work, and I know because I remember someone telling me that I was stupid for being Mormon. And what it caused me to do was defend myself and my people and everything we believe in, because we're not stupid.So criticism and hostility doesn't work, and I didn't listen to these arguments. When I hear these arguments, I still continue to bristle, because I have family and friends. These are my people, and I'm the first to defend them, but the struggle is real. How do we respect someone's religious beliefs while still holding them accountable for the harm or damage that those beliefs may cause others? It's a tough question. I still don't have a perfect answer. My parents and I have been walking on this tightrope for the last decade. They're intelligent people. They're lovely people. And let me try to help you understand their perspective. In Mormonism, we believe that after you die, if you keep all the rules and you follow all the rituals, you can be together as a family again. And to my parents, me doing something as simple as having a sleeveless top right now, showing my shoulders, that makes me unworthy. I won't be with my family in the eternities. But even more, I had a brother die in a tragic accident at 15, and something as simple as this means we won't be together as a family. And to my parents, they cannot understand why something as simple as fashion or women's rights would prevent me from seeing my brother again. And that's the mindset that we're dealing with, and criticism does not change that. And so my parents and I have been walking this tightrope, explaining our sides, respecting one another, but actually invalidating each other's very basic beliefs by the way we live our lives, and it's been difficult. The way that we've been able to do that is to get past those defensive shells and really see the soft inside of unbelief and belief and try to respect each other while still holding boundaries clear.The other thing that the secular left and the atheists and the orthodox and the religious right, what they all don't understand was why even care about religious activism? I cannot tell you the hundreds of people who have said, \"If you don't like religion, just leave.\" Why would you try to change it? Because what is taught on the Sabbath leaks into our politics, our health policy, violence around the world. It leaks into education, military, fiscal decision-making. These laws get legally and culturally codified. In fact, my own religion has had an enormous effect on this nation. For example, during Prop 8, my church raised over 22 million dollars to fight same-sex marriage in California. Forty years ago, political historians will say, that if it wasn't for the Mormon opposition to the Equal Rights Amendment, we'd have an Equal Rights Amendment in our Constitution today. How many lives did that affect? And we can spend time fighting every single one of these little tiny laws and rules, or we can ask ourselves, why is gender inequality the default around the world? Why is that the assumption?Because religion doesn't just create the roots of morality, it creates the seeds of normality. Religions can liberate or subjugate, they can empower or exploit, they can comfort or destroy, and the people that tip the scales over to the ethical and the moral are often not those in charge. Religions can't be dismissed or ignored. We need to take them seriously. But it's not easy to influence a religion, like we just talked about.But I'll tell you what my people have done. My groups are small, there's hundreds of us, but we've had huge impact. Right now, women's pictures are hanging in the halls next to men for the first time. Women are now allowed to pray in our church-wide meetings, and they never were before in the general conferences. As of last week, in a historic move, three women were invited down to three leadership boards that oversee the entire church. We've seen perceptual shifts in the Mormon community that allow for talk of gender inequality. We've opened up space, regardless of being despised, for more conservative women to step in and make real changes, and the words \"women\" and \"the priesthood\" can now be uttered in the same sentence. I never had that. My daughter and my nieces are inheriting a religion that I never had, that's more equal \u2014 we've had an effect.It wasn't easy standing in those lines trying to get into those male meetings. There were hundreds of us, and one by one, when we got to the door, we were told, \"I'm sorry, this meeting is just for men,\" and we had to step back and watch men get into the meeting as young as 12 years old, escorted and walked past us as we all stood in line. But not one woman in that line will forget that day, and not one little boy that walked past us will forget that day.If we were a multinational corporation or a government, and that had happened, there would be outrage, but we're just a religion. We're all just part of religions. We can't keep looking at religion that way, because it doesn't only affect me, it affects my daughter and all of your daughters and what opportunities they have, what they can wear, who they can love and marry, if they have access to reproductive healthcare. We need to reclaim morality in a secular context that creates ethical scrutiny and accountability for religions all around the world, but we need to do it in a respectful way that breeds cooperation and not extremism. And we can do it through unignorable acts of bravery, standing up for gender equality.It's time that half of the world's population had voice and equality within our world's religions, churches, synagogues, mosques and shrines around the world. I'm working on my people.

been\ndoing it for three decades.\n\n00:01:13.998 --> 00:01:18.494\nI was the type of girl that fought every\nform of gender discrimination growing up.\n\n00:01:18.518 --> 00:01:22.534\nI played pickup basketball games\nwith the boys and inserted myself.\n\n00:01:22.558 --> 00:01:25.994\nI said I was going to be the first\nfemale President of the United States.\n\n00:01:26.018 --> 00:01:28.454\nI have been fighting\nfor the Equal Rights Amendment,\n\n00:01:28.478 --> 00:01:30.934\nwhich has been dead for 40 years.\n\n00:01:30.958 --> 00:01:34.094\nI'm the first woman\nin both sides of my family\n\n00:01:34.118 --> 00:01:38.294\nto ever work outside the home\nand ever receive a higher education.\n\n00:01:38.318 --> 00:01:43.134\nI never accepted being excluded\nbecause I was a woman,\n\n00:01:43.158 --> 00:01:45.334\nexcept in my religion.\n\n00:01:45.358 --> 00:01:46.734\nThroughout all of that time,\n\n00:01:46.758 --> 00:01:51.054\nI was a part of a very patriarchal\northodox Mormon religion.\n\n00:01:51.078 --> 00:01:53.854\nI grew up in an enormously\ntraditional family.\n\n00:01:53.878 --> 00:01:56.014\nI have eight siblings,\na stay-at-home mother.\n\n00:01:56.038 --> 00:01:59.238\nMy father's actually\na religious leader in the community.\n\n00:02:00.118 --> 00:02:04.974\nAnd I grew up in a world believing\nthat my worth and my standing\n\n00:02:04.998 --> 00:02:09.054\nwas in keeping these rules\nthat I'd known my whole life.\n\n00:02:09.078 --> 00:02:11.894\nYou get married a virgin,\nyou never drink alcohol,\n\n00:02:11.918 --> 00:02:14.294\nyou don't smoke, you always do service,\n\n00:02:14.318 --> 00:02:16.294\nyou're a good kid.\n\n00:02:16.318 --> 00:02:19.894\nSome of the rules we had were strict,\n\n00:02:19.918 --> 00:02:22.534\nbut you followed the rules\nbecause you loved the people\n\n00:02:22.558 --> 00:02:25.214\nand you loved the religion\nand you believed.\n\n00:02:25.238 --> 00:02:28.054\nEverything about Mormonism\ndetermined what you wore,\n\n00:02:28.078 --> 00:02:29.584\nwho you dated, who you married.\n\n00:02:29.609 --> 00:02:31.958\nIt determined what underwear we wore.\n\n00:02:32.998 --> 00:02:36.054\nI was the kind of religious\nwhere everyone I know\n\n00:02:36.078 --> 00:02:39.454\ndonated 10 percent of everything\nthey earned to the church,\n\n00:02:39.478 --> 00:02:40.694\nincluding myself.\n\n00:02:40.718 --> 00:02:44.654\nFrom paper routes and babysitting,\nI donated 10 percent.\n\n00:02:44.678 --> 00:02:47.734\nI was the kind of religious\nwhere I heard parents tell children\n\n00:02:47.758 --> 00:02:51.374\nwhen they're leaving\non a two-year proselytizing mission\n\n00:02:51.398 --> 00:02:53.934\nthat they would rather have them die\n\n00:02:53.958 --> 00:02:57.174\nthan return home\nwithout honor, having sinned.\n\n00:02:57.198 --> 00:02:59.654\nI was the type and the kind of religious\n\n00:02:59.678 --> 00:03:03.134\nwhere kids kill themselves\nevery single year\n\n00:03:03.158 --> 00:03:07.494\nbecause they're terrified\nof coming out to our community as gay.\n\n00:03:07.518 --> 00:03:09.534\nBut I was also the kind of religious\n\n00:03:09.558 --> 00:03:12.094\nwhere it didn't matter\nwhere in the world I lived,\n\n00:03:12.118 --> 00:03:15.894\nI had friendship,\ninstantaneous mutual aid.\n\n00:03:15.918 --> 00:03:20.134\nThis was where I felt safe.\nThis is certainty and clarity about life.\n\n00:03:20.158 --> 00:03:22.414\nI had help raising my little daughter.\n\n00:03:22.438 --> 00:03:27.334\nSo that's why I accepted without question\nthat only men can lead,\n\n00:03:27.358 --> 00:03:29.494\nand I accepted without question\n\n00:03:29.518 --> 00:03:32.654\nthat women can't have the spiritual\nauthority of God on the Earth,\n\n00:03:32.678 --> 00:03:34.094\nwhich we call the priesthood.\n\n00:03:34.118 --> 00:03:38.614\nAnd I allowed discrepancies between\nmen and women in operating budgets,\n\n00:03:38.638 --> 00:03:42.014\ndisciplinary councils,\nin decision-making capacities,\n\n00:03:42.038 --> 00:03:45.174\nand I gave my religion a free pass\n\n00:03:45.198 --> 00:03:47.054\nbecause I loved it.\n\n00:03:47.078 --> 00:03:49.054\nUntil I stopped,\n\n00:03:49.078 --> 00:03:52.694\nand I realized that I had\nbeen allowing myself to be treated\n\n00:03:52.718 --> 00:03:57.614\nas the support staff\nto the real work of men.\n\n00:03:57.638 --> 00:04:00.014\nAnd I faced this contradiction in myself,\n\n00:04:00.038 --> 00:04:02.774\nand I joined with other activists\nin my community.\n\n00:04:02.798 --> 00:04:07.174\nWe've been working very, very, very hard\nfor the last decade and more.\n\n00:04:07.198 --> 00:04:09.412\nThe first thing we did\nwas raise consciousness.\n\n00:04:09.436 --> 00:04:11.934\nYou can't change what you can't see.\n\n00:04:11.958 --> 00:04:15.174\nWe started podcasting,\nblogging, writing articles.\n\n00:04:15.198 --> 00:04:17.734\nI created lists of hundreds of ways\n\n00:04:17.758 --> 00:04:20.774\nthat men and women\nare unequal in our community.\n\n00:04:20.798 --> 00:04:24.294\nThe next thing we did\nwas build advocacy organizations.\n\n00:04:24.318 --> 00:04:28.254\nWe tried to do things\nthat were unignorable,\n\n00:04:28.278 --> 00:04:33.734\nlike wearing pants to church\nand trying to attend all-male meetings.\n\n00:04:33.758 --> 00:04:36.254\nThese seem like simple things,\n\n00:04:36.278 --> 00:04:40.494\nbut to us,

00:06:41.014\nMy parents and I have been walking\non this tightrope for the last decade.\n\n00:06:41.038 --> 00:06:43.774\nThey're intelligent people.\nThey're lovely people.\n\n00:06:43.798 --> 00:06:47.694\nAnd let me try to help you\nunderstand their perspective.\n\n00:06:47.718 --> 00:06:50.694\nIn Mormonism, we believe\nthat after you die,\n\n00:06:50.718 --> 00:06:54.054\nif you keep all the rules\nand you follow all the rituals,\n\n00:06:54.078 --> 00:06:57.174\nyou can be together as a family again.\n\n00:06:57.198 --> 00:06:59.614\nAnd to my parents,\nme doing something as simple\n\n00:06:59.638 --> 00:07:03.014\nas having a sleeveless top right now,\nshowing my shoulders,\n\n00:07:03.038 --> 00:07:04.814\nthat makes me unworthy.\n\n00:07:04.838 --> 00:07:08.174\nI won't be with my family\nin the eternities.\n\n00:07:08.198 --> 00:07:12.374\nBut even more, I had a brother\ndie in a tragic accident at 15,\n\n00:07:12.398 --> 00:07:16.654\nand something as simple as this\nmeans we won't be together as a family.\n\n00:07:16.678 --> 00:07:20.254\nAnd to my parents, they cannot understand\n\n00:07:20.278 --> 00:07:23.374\nwhy something as simple\nas fashion or women's rights\n\n00:07:23.398 --> 00:07:26.094\nwould prevent me\nfrom seeing my brother again.\n\n00:07:26.118 --> 00:07:28.854\nAnd that's the mindset\nthat we're dealing with,\n\n00:07:28.878 --> 00:07:31.974\nand criticism does not change that.\n\n00:07:31.998 --> 00:07:34.694\nAnd so my parents and I\nhave been walking this tightrope,\n\n00:07:34.718 --> 00:07:37.654\nexplaining our sides,\nrespecting one another,\n\n00:07:37.678 --> 00:07:41.654\nbut actually invalidating\neach other's very basic beliefs\n\n00:07:41.678 --> 00:07:45.014\nby the way we live our lives,\nand it's been difficult.\n\n00:07:45.038 --> 00:07:47.494\nThe way that we've been able to do that\n\n00:07:47.518 --> 00:07:49.934\nis to get past those defensive shells\n\n00:07:49.958 --> 00:07:53.974\nand really see the soft inside\nof unbelief and belief\n\n00:07:53.998 --> 00:07:58.614\nand try to respect each other\nwhile still holding boundaries clear.\n\n00:07:58.638 --> 00:08:03.094\nThe other thing that the secular left\nand the atheists and the orthodox\n\n00:08:03.118 --> 00:08:07.134\nand the religious right,\nwhat they all don't understand\n\n00:08:07.158 --> 00:08:10.014\nwas why even care\nabout religious activism?\n\n00:08:10.038 --> 00:08:13.094\nI cannot tell you the hundreds\nof people who have said,\n\n00:08:13.118 --> 00:08:15.734\n\"If you don't like religion, just leave.\"\n\n00:08:15.758 --> 00:08:17.638\nWhy would you try to change it?\n\n00:08:18.838 --> 00:08:21.275\nBecause what is taught on the Sabbath\n\n00:08:21.300 --> 00:08:24.334\nleaks into our politics,\nour health policy,\n\n00:08:24.358 --> 00:08:26.214\nviolence around the world.\n\n00:08:26.238 --> 00:08:29.934\nIt leaks into education,\nmilitary, fiscal decision-making.\n\n00:08:29.958 --> 00:08:33.254\nThese laws get legally\nand culturally codified.\n\n00:08:33.278 --> 00:08:38.214\nIn fact, my own religion has had\nan enormous effect on this nation.\n\n00:08:38.238 --> 00:08:42.814\nFor example, during Prop 8,\nmy church raised over 22 million dollars\n\n00:08:42.838 --> 00:08:46.117\nto fight same-sex marriage in California.\n\n00:08:46.798 --> 00:08:51.014\nForty years ago,\npolitical historians will say,\n\n00:08:51.038 --> 00:08:54.894\nthat if it wasn't for the Mormon\nopposition to the Equal Rights Amendment,\n\n00:08:54.918 --> 00:08:58.734\nwe'd have an Equal Rights Amendment\nin our Constitution today.\n\n00:08:58.758 --> 00:09:01.918\nHow many lives did that affect?\n\n00:09:02.758 --> 00:09:05.534\nAnd we can spend time\nfighting every single one\n\n00:09:05.558 --> 00:09:08.694\nof these little tiny laws and rules,\n\n00:09:08.718 --> 00:09:10.294\nor we can ask ourselves,\n\n00:09:10.318 --> 00:09:16.494\nwhy is gender inequality\nthe default around the world?\n\n00:09:16.518 --> 00:09:19.174\nWhy is that the assumption?\n\n00:09:19.198 --> 00:09:25.134\nBecause religion doesn't just\ncreate the roots of morality,\n\n00:09:25.158 --> 00:09:29.214\nit creates the seeds of normality.\n\n00:09:29.238 --> 00:09:32.574\nReligions can liberate or subjugate,\n\n00:09:32.598 --> 00:09:35.814\nthey can empower or exploit,\nthey can comfort or destroy,\n\n00:09:35.838 --> 00:09:40.374\nand the people that tip the scales\nover to the ethical and the moral\n\n00:09:40.398 --> 00:09:43.534\nare often not those in charge.\n\n00:09:43.558 --> 00:09:46.454\nReligions can't be dismissed or ignored.\n\n00:09:46.478 --> 00:09:49.374\nWe need to take them seriously.\n\n00:09:49.398 --> 00:09:53.934\nBut it's not easy to influence a religion,\nlike we just talked about.\n\n00:09:53.958 --> 00:09:56.174\nBut I'll tell you\nwhat my people have done.\n\n00:09:56.198 --> 00:09:58.294\nMy groups are small,\nthere's hundreds of us,\n\n00:09:58.318 --> 00:10:00.694\nbut we've had huge impact.\n\n00:10:00.718 --> 00:10:03.734\nRight now, women's pictures\nare hanging in the halls next to men\n\n00:10:03.758 --> 00:10:04.974\nfor the first time.\n\n00:10:04.998 --> 00:10:07.734\nWomen are now allowed\nto pray in our church-wide meetings,\n\n00:10:07.758 --> 00:10:10.774\nand they never were before\nin the general conferences.\n\n00:10:10.798 --> 00:10:13.334\nAs of last week, in a historic move,\n\n00:10:13.358 --> 00:10:16.534\nthree women were invited\ndown to three leadership boards\n\n00:10:16.558 --> 00:10:18.534\nthat oversee the entire church.\n\n00:10:18.558 --> 00:10:21.374\nWe've seen perceptual shifts\nin the Mormon community\n\n00:10:21.398 --> 00:10:23.894\nthat allow for talk of gender inequality.\n\n00:10:23.918 --> 00:10:27.294\nWe've opened up space,\nregardless of being despised,\n\n00:10:27.318 --> 00:10:31.214\nfor more conservative women\nto step in and make real changes,\n\n00:10:31.238 --> 00:10:36.094\nand the words \"women\" and \"the priesthood\"\ncan now be uttered in the same sentence.\n\n00:10:36.118 --> 00:10:38.734\nI never had that.\n\n00:10:38.758 --> 00:10:43.334\nMy daughter and my nieces are inheriting\na religion that I never had,\n\n00:10:43.358 --> 00:10:46.118\nthat's more equal -- we've had an effect.\n\n00:10:47.358 --> 00:10:50.254\nIt wasn't easy standing in those lines\n\n00:10:50.278 --> 00:10:53.454\ntrying to get into those male meetings.\n\n00:10:53.478 --> 00:10:55.654\nThere were hundreds of us,\n\n00:10:55.678 --> 00:10:58.294\nand one by one, when we got to the door,\n\n00:10:58.318 --> 00:11:01.974\nwe were told, \"I'm sorry,\nthis meeting is just for men,\"\n\n00:11:01.998 --> 00:11:06.774\nand we had to step back\nand watch men get into the meeting\n\n00:11:06.798 --> 00:11:08.934\nas young as 12 years old,\n\n00:11:08.958 --> 00:11:13.014\nescorted and walked past us\nas we all stood in line.\n\n00:11:13.038 --> 00:11:15.774\nBut not one woman in that line\nwill forget that day,\n\n00:11:15.798 --> 00:11:19.758\nand not one little boy\nthat walked past us will forget that day.\n\n00:11:21.478 --> 00:11:27.094\nIf we were a multinational corporation\nor a government, and that had happened,\n\n00:11:27.118 --> 00:11:28.734\nthere would be outrage,\n\n00:11:28.758 --> 00:11:31.174\nbut we're just a religion.\n\n00:11:31.198 --> 00:11:34.158\nWe're all just part of religions.\n\n00:11:35.078 --> 00:11:37.814\nWe can't keep looking\nat religion that way,\n\n00:11:37.838 --> 00:11:40.694\nbecause it doesn't only affect me,\nit affects my daughter\n\n00:11:40.718 --> 00:11:43.694\nand all of your daughters\nand what opportunities they have,\n\n00:11:43.718 --> 00:11:45.971\nwhat they can wear,\nwho they can love and marry,\n\n00:11:45.996 --> 00:11:49.094\nif they have access\nto reproductive healthcare.\n\n00:11:49.118 --> 00:11:52.454\nWe need to reclaim morality\nin a secular context\n\n00:11:52.478 --> 00:11:54.734\nthat creates ethical scrutiny\nand accountability\n\n00:11:54.758 --> 00:11:56.934\nfor religions all around the world,\n\n00:11:56.958 --> 00:12:00.094\nbut we need to do it in a respectful way\n\n00:12:00.118 --> 00:12:03.334\nthat breeds cooperation and not extremism.\n\n00:12:03.358 --> 00:12:07.414\nAnd we can do it through\nunignorable acts of bravery,\n\n00:12:07.438 --> 00:12:10.774\nstanding up for gender equality.\n\n00:12:10.798 --> 00:12:13.294\nIt's time that half\nof the world's population\n\n00:12:13.318 --> 00:12:16.254\nhad voice and equality\nwithin our world's religions,\n\n00:12:16.278 --> 00:12:20.814\nchurches, synagogues, mosques\nand shrines around the world.\n\n00:12:20.838 --> 00:12:24.398\nI'm working on my people.\nWhat are you doing for yours?\n\n00:12:25.358 --> 00:12:31.198\n(Applause)"}, {"title": "The chilling aftershock of a brush with death", "duration": "930", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/jean_paul_mari_the_chilling_aftershock_of_a_brush_with_death", "transcript": "It was April 8, 2003. I was in Baghdad, covering the war in Iraq. That day, Americans tanks started arriving in Baghdad. We were just a few journalists in the Palestine Hotel, and, as happens in war, the fighting began to approach outside our windows. Baghdad was covered in black smoke and oil. It smelled awful. We couldn't see a thing, but we knew what was happening.Of course, I was supposed to be writing an article, but that's how it always goes \u2014 you're supposed to be writing and something big happens. So I was in my room on the 16th floor, writing and looking out the window every now and then to see what was happening. Suddenly, there was a huge explosion. During the previous three weeks, there had been shelling with half-ton missiles, but this time, the shock \u2014 I felt it inside of me, and I thought, \"It's very close. It's very, very close.\"So I went down to see what was happening. I went down to the 15th floor to take a look. And I saw people, journalists, screaming in the hallways. I walked into a room and realized that it had been hit by a missile. Someone had been wounded. There was a man near the window, a cameraman named Taras Protsyuk, lying face-down. Having worked in a hospital before, I wanted to help out. So I turned him over. And when I turned him over, I noticed that he was open from sternum to pubis, but I couldn't see anything, nothing at all. All I saw was a white, pearly, shiny spot that blinded me, and I didn't understand what was going on.Once the spot disappeared and I could see his wound, which was very serious, my buddies and I put a sheet underneath him, and we carried him onto an elevator that stopped at each of the 15 floors. We put him in a car that took him to the hospital. He died on the way to the hospital. The Spanish cameraman Jos\u00e9 Couso, who was on the 14th floor and also hit \u2014 because the shell had exploded between the two floors \u2014 died on the operating table. As soon as the car left, I went back. There was that article I was supposed to write \u2014 which I had to write.And so \u2014 I returned to the hotel lobby with my arms covered in blood, when one of the hotel gofers stopped me and asked me to pay the tax I hadn't paid for 10 days. I told him to get lost. And I said to myself: \"Clear your head, put it all aside. If you want to write, you need to put it all aside.\" And that's what I did. I went upstairs, wrote my article and sent it off.Later, aside from the feeling of having lost my colleagues, something else was bothering me. I kept seeing that shiny, pearly spot, and I couldn't understand what it meant. And then, the war was over.Later, I thought: \"That's not possible. I can't just not know what happened.\" Because it wasn't the first time, and it didn't only happen to me. I have seen things like that happen to others in my 20 to 35 years of reporting. I have seen things that had an effect on me too. For example, there was this man I knew in Lebanon, a 25-year-old veteran who had been fighting for five years \u2014 a real veteran \u2014 who we would follow everywhere. He would crawl in the dark with confidence \u2014 he was a great soldier, a true soldier \u2014 so we would follow him, knowing that we would be safe with him. And one day, as I was told \u2014 and I've seen him again since \u2014 he was back in the camp, playing cards, when someone came in next door, and discharged their weapon. As the gun went off, that blast, that one shot, made him duck quickly under the table, like a child. He was shaking, panicking. And since then, he has never been able to get up and fight. He ended up working as a croupier in a Beirut casino where I later found him, because he couldn't sleep, so it was quite a suitable job.So I thought to myself, \"What is this thing that can kill you without leaving any visible scars? How does that happen? What is this unknown thing?\" It was too common to be coincidental.So I started to investigate \u2014 that's all I know how to do. I started to investigate by looking through books, reaching out to psychiatrists, going to museums, libraries, etc. Finally, I discovered that some people knew about this \u2014 often military psychiatrists \u2014 and that what we were dealing with was called trauma. Americans call it PTSD or traumatic neurosis. It was something that existed, but that we never spoke about.So, this trauma \u2014 what is it? Well, it's an encounter with death. I don't know if you've ever had an experience with death \u2014 I'm not talking about dead bodies, or someone's grandfather lying in a hospital bed, or someone who got hit by a car. I'm talking about facing the void of death. And that is something no one is supposed to see. People used to say, \"Neither the sun, nor death can be looked at with a steady eye.\" A human being should not have to face the void of death.But when that happens, it can remain invisible for a while \u2014 days, weeks, months, sometimes years. And then, at some point, it explodes, because it's something that has entered your brain \u2014 a sort of window between an image and your mind \u2014 that has penetrated your brain, staying there and taking up all the space inside. And there are people \u2014 men, women, who suddenly no longer sleep. And they experience horrible anxiety attacks \u2014 panic attacks, not just minor fears. They suddenly don't want to sleep, because when they do, they have the same nightmare every night. They see the same image every night. What type of image? For example, a soldier who enters a building and comes face to face with another soldier aiming at him. He looks at the gun, straight down the barrel. And this barrel suddenly becomes enormous, deformed. It becomes fluffy, swallowing everything. And he says \u2014 later he will say, \"I saw death. I saw myself dead, therefore I'm dead.\" And from then on, he knows he is dead. It is not a perception \u2014 he is convinced that he is dead. In reality, someone came in, the guy left or didn't shoot, whatever, and he didn't actually get shot \u2014 but to him, he died in that moment. Or it can be the smell of a mass grave \u2014 I saw a lot of that in Rwanda. It can be the voice of a friend calling, and they're being slaughtered and there's nothing you can do. You hear that voice, and you wake up every night \u2014 for weeks, months \u2014 in a trance-like state, anxious and terrified, like a child. I have seen men cry \u2014 just like children \u2014 from seeing the same image.So having that image of horror in your brain, seeing the void of death \u2014 that analogue of horror which is hiding something \u2014 will completely take over. You cannot do anything, anything at all. You cannot work anymore, you cannot love anymore. You go home and don't recognize anyone. You don't even recognize yourself. You hide and don't leave the house, you lock yourself in, you become ill. I know people who placed small cans outside their house with coins inside, in case someone tried to get in. All of a sudden, you feel like you want to die or kill or hide or run away. You want to be loved, but you hate everyone. It's a feeling that seizes you entirely day in and day out, and you suffer tremendously. And no one understands. They say, \"There's nothing wrong with you. You seem fine, you have no injuries. You went to war, came back; you're fine.\" These people suffer tremendously. Some commit suicide. After all, suicide is like updating your daily planner \u2014 I'm already dead, I might as well commit suicide. Plus, there is no more pain. Some commit suicide, others end up under the bridge, drinking. Everyone remembers that grandfather or uncle or neighbor who used to drink, never said a word, always in a bad mood, beat his wife and who would end up either sinking into alcoholism or dying.And why do we not talk about this? We don't talk about it because it's taboo. It's not like we don't have the words to express the void of death. But others don't want hear it. The first time I returned from an assignment, They said, \"Oh! He's back.\" There was a fancy dinner \u2014 white tablecloth, candles, guests. \"Tell us everything!\" Which I did. After 20 minutes, people were giving me dirty looks, the hostess had her nose in the ashtray. It was horrible and I realized I ruined the whole evening. So I don't talk about it anymore. We're just not ready to listen. People say outright: \"Please, stop.\"Is that a rare occurrence? No, it's extremely common. One third of the soldiers who died in Iraq \u2014 well, not \"died,\" let me re-phrase that \u2014 one third of the US soldiers who went to Iraq suffer from PTSD. In 1939, there were still 200,000 soldiers from the First World War that were being treated in British psychiatric hospitals. In Vietnam, 54,000 people died \u2014 Americans. In 1987, the US government identified 102,000 \u2014 twice as many \u2014 102,000 veterans who died from committing suicide. Twice as many deaths by suicide than by combat in Vietnam. So you see, this relates to everything, not just modern warfare, but also ancient wars \u2014 you can read about it, the evidence is there. So why do we not talk about it? Why have we not talked about it? The problem is that if you don't talk about it, you're heading for disaster.The only way to heal \u2014 and the good news here is that this is treatable \u2014 think Munch's The Scream, Goya, etc. \u2014 it's indeed treatable. The only way to heal from this trauma, from this encounter with death that overwhelms, petrifies and kills you is to find a way to express it.People used to say, \"Language is the only thing that holds all of us together.\" Without language, we're nothing. It's the thing that makes us human. In the face of such a horrible image \u2014 a wordless image of oblivion that obsesses us \u2014 the only way to cope with it is to put human words to it. Because these people feel excluded from humanity. No one wants to see them anymore and they don't want to see anyone. They feel dirty, defiled, ashamed. Someone said, \"Doctor, I don't use the subway anymore because I'm afraid people will see the horror in my eyes.\" Another guy thought he had a terrible skin disease and spent six months with dermatologists, going from doctor to doctor. And then one day, they sent him to a psychiatrist. During his second session, he told the psychiatrist he had a terrible skin disease from head to toe. The psychiatrist asked, \"Why are you in this state?\" And the man said, \"Well, because I'm dead, so I must be rotting away.\"So you see this is something that has a profound effect on people. In order to heal, we need to talk about it. The horror needs to be put into words \u2014 human words, so we can organize it and talk about it again. We have to look death in the face. And if we can do that, if we can talk about these things, then step by step, by working it out verbally, we can reclaim our place in humanity. And it is important. Silence kills us.So what does this mean? It means that after a trauma, without question, we lose our \"unbearable lightness of being,\" that sense of immortality that keeps us here \u2014 meaning, if we're here, we almost feel like we're immortal, which we're not, but if we didn't believe that, we'd say, \"What's the point of it all?\" But trauma survivors have lost that feeling of immortality. They've lost their lightness. But they have found something else. So this means that if we manage to look death in the face, and actually confront it, rather than keep quiet and hide, like some of the men or women I know did, such as Michael from Rwanda, Carole from Iraq, Philippe from the Congo and other people I know, like Sorj Chalandon, now a great writer, who gave up field assignments after a trauma. Five friends of mine committed suicide, they're the ones who did not survive the trauma.So if we can look death in the face, if we, mortal humans, human mortals, understand that we are human and mortal, mortal and human, if we can confront death and identify it once again as the most mysterious place of all mysterious places, since no one has ever seen it \u2014 if we can give it back this meaning, yes, we may die, survive and come back to life, but we'll come back stronger than before. Much stronger.Thank you.(Applause)", "id": 2374, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:13.021 --> 00:00:17.140\nIt was April 8, 2003.\n\n00:00:17.814 -->

00:02:04.455\nSo I turned him over.\n\n00:02:04.479 --> 00:02:06.181\nAnd when I turned him over,\n\n00:02:08.292 --> 00:02:11.443\nI noticed that he was open\nfrom sternum to pubis,\n\n00:02:11.467 --> 00:02:13.577\nbut I couldn't see anything,\nnothing at all.\n\n00:02:14.425 --> 00:02:21.179\nAll I saw was a white, pearly,\nshiny spot that blinded me,\n\n00:02:21.203 --> 00:02:23.210\nand I didn't understand what was going on.\n\n00:02:23.837 --> 00:02:26.489\nOnce the spot disappeared\nand I could see his wound,\n\n00:02:26.513 --> 00:02:28.090\nwhich was very serious,\n\n00:02:28.114 --> 00:02:30.209\nmy buddies and I put a sheet\nunderneath him,\n\n00:02:30.233 --> 00:02:34.018\nand we carried him onto an elevator\nthat stopped at each of the 15 floors.\n\n00:02:34.574 --> 00:02:36.918\nWe put him in a car\nthat took him to the hospital.\n\n00:02:36.942 --> 00:02:38.704\nHe died on the way to the hospital.\n\n00:02:38.728 --> 00:02:43.718\nThe Spanish cameraman Jos\u00e9 Couso,\nwho was on the 14th floor and also hit --\n\n00:02:43.742 --> 00:02:47.052\nbecause the shell had exploded\nbetween the two floors --\n\n00:02:47.076 --> 00:02:49.012\ndied on the operating table.\n\n00:02:49.036 --> 00:02:51.433\nAs soon as the car left, I went back.\n\n00:02:51.457 --> 00:02:53.790\nThere was that article\nI was supposed to write --\n\n00:02:53.814 --> 00:02:55.480\nwhich I had to write.\n\n00:02:56.075 --> 00:02:57.804\nAnd so --\n\n00:02:57.828 --> 00:03:04.726\nI returned to the hotel lobby\nwith my arms covered in blood,\n\n00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:07.290\nwhen one of the hotel gofers stopped me\n\n00:03:07.314 --> 00:03:11.161\nand asked me to pay the tax\nI hadn't paid for 10 days.\n\n00:03:11.185 --> 00:03:12.993\nI told him to get lost.\n\n00:03:13.017 --> 00:03:17.627\nAnd I said to myself:\n\"Clear your head, put it all aside.\n\n00:03:19.055 --> 00:03:21.504\nIf you want to write,\nyou need to put it all aside.\"\n\n00:03:21.528 --> 00:03:22.743\nAnd that's what I did.\n\n00:03:22.767 --> 00:03:25.671\nI went upstairs, wrote\nmy article and sent it off.\n\n00:03:27.035 --> 00:03:30.956\nLater, aside from the feeling\nof having lost my colleagues,\n\n00:03:31.853 --> 00:03:34.376\nsomething else was bothering me.\n\n00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:38.167\nI kept seeing that shiny, pearly spot,\n\n00:03:40.693 --> 00:03:43.081\nand I couldn't understand what it meant.\n\n00:03:43.689 --> 00:03:46.204\nAnd then, the war was over.\n\n00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:54.626\nLater, I thought: \"That's not possible.\nI can't just not know what happened.\"\n\n00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:58.111\nBecause it wasn't the first time,\nand it didn't only happen to me.\n\n00:03:58.135 --> 00:04:02.040\nI have seen things like that\nhappen to others\n\n00:04:02.064 --> 00:04:04.732\nin my 20 to 35 years of reporting.\n\n00:04:04.756 --> 00:04:08.042\nI have seen things\nthat had an effect on me too.\n\n00:04:08.066 --> 00:04:11.111\nFor example, there was this man\nI knew in Lebanon,\n\n00:04:11.135 --> 00:04:14.041\na 25-year-old veteran\nwho had been fighting for five years --\n\n00:04:14.065 --> 00:04:16.408\na real veteran -- who we would\nfollow everywhere.\n\n00:04:16.432 --> 00:04:19.918\nHe would crawl in the dark\nwith confidence --\n\n00:04:20.689 --> 00:04:23.101\nhe was a great soldier, a true soldier --\n\n00:04:23.125 --> 00:04:26.482\nso we would follow him,\nknowing that we would be safe with him.\n\n00:04:26.506 --> 00:04:28.814\nAnd one day, as I was told --\n\n00:04:28.838 --> 00:04:30.434\nand I've seen him again since --\n\n00:04:30.458 --> 00:04:32.799\nhe was back in the camp, playing cards,\n\n00:04:32.823 --> 00:04:34.704\nwhen someone came in next door,\n\n00:04:36.116 --> 00:04:38.252\nand discharged their weapon.\n\n00:04:38.276 --> 00:04:39.784\nAs the gun went off,\n\n00:04:39.808 --> 00:04:45.363\nthat blast, that one shot,\nmade him duck quickly under the table,\n\n00:04:46.162 --> 00:04:47.376\nlike a child.\n\n00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:49.291\nHe was shaking, panicking.\n\n00:04:49.315 --> 00:04:54.123\nAnd since then, he has never\nbeen able to get up and fight.\n\n00:04:54.147 --> 00:04:56.839\nHe ended up working as a croupier\n\n00:04:56.863 --> 00:04:58.985\nin a Beirut casino\nwhere I later found him,\n\n00:04:59.009 --> 00:05:01.878\nbecause he couldn't sleep,\nso it was quite a suitable job.\n\n00:05:02.336 --> 00:05:04.153\nSo I thought to myself,\n\n00:05:04.915 --> 00:05:07.176\n\"What is this thing that can kill you\n\n00:05:07.993 --> 00:05:12.550\nwithout leaving\nany visible scars?\n\n00:05:12.932 --> 00:05:14.915\nHow does that happen?\n\n00:05:15.998 --> 00:05:17.998\nWhat is this unknown thing?\"\n\n00:05:19.164 --> 00:05:23.531\nIt was too common to be coincidental.\n\n00:05:23.555 --> 00:05:25.213\nSo I started to investigate --\n\n00:05:25.237 --> 00:05:27.231\nthat's all I know how to do.\n\n00:05:27.255 --> 00:05:29.098\nI started to investigate\n\n00:05:29.122 --> 00:05:31.669\nby looking through books,\n\n00:05:32.794 --> 00:05:35.136\nreaching out to psychiatrists,\n\n00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:37.722\ngoing to museums, libraries, etc.\n\n00:05:38.182 --> 00:05:42.281\nFinally, I discovered\nthat some people knew about this --\n\n00:05:42.908 --> 00:05:44.838\noften military psychiatrists --\n\n00:05:44.862 --> 00:05:49.751\nand that what we were dealing with\nwas called trauma.\n\n00:05:49.775 --> 00:05:54.601\nAmericans call it PTSD\nor traumatic neurosis.\n\n00:05:54.625 --> 00:05:56.490\nIt was something\n\n00:05:58.220 --> 00:05:59.616\nthat existed,\n\n00:06:00.164 --> 00:06:02.346\nbut that we never spoke about.\n\n00:06:04.164 --> 00:06:05.568\nSo, this trauma --\n\n00:06:06.410 --> 00:06:07.567\nwhat is it?\n\n00:06:07.591 --> 00:06:10.402\nWell, it's an encounter with death.\n\n00:06:11.084 --> 00:06:13.886\nI don't know if you've ever had\nan experience with death --\n\n00:06:13.910 --> 00:06:15.793\nI'm not talking about dead bodies,\n\n00:06:15.817 --> 00:06:19.418\nor someone's grandfather\nlying in a hospital bed,\n\n00:06:19.442 --> 00:06:23.016\nor someone who got hit by a car.\n\n00:06:24.092 --> 00:06:28.552\nI'm talking about facing\nthe void of death.\n\n00:06:29.646 --> 00:06:35.819\nAnd that is something\nno one is supposed to see.\n\n00:06:35.843 --> 00:06:37.685\nPeople used to say,\n\n00:06:37.709 --> 00:06:41.684\n\"Neither the sun, nor death\ncan be looked at with a steady eye.\"\n\n00:06:41.708 --> 00:06:45.942\nA human being should not\nhave to face the void of death.\n\n00:06:45.966 --> 00:06:47.807\nBut when that happens,\n\n00:06:49.759 --> 00:06:53.507\nit can remain invisible for a while --\n\n00:06:53.531 --> 00:06:56.299\ndays, weeks, months, sometimes years.\n\n00:06:56.323 --> 00:06:58.084\nAnd then, at some point,\n\n00:06:59.545 --> 00:07:00.831\nit explodes,\n\n00:07:00.855 --> 00:07:04.599\nbecause it's something\nthat has entered your brain --\n\n00:07:04.623 --> 00:07:09.274\na sort of window between an image\nand your mind --\n\n00:07:09.298 --> 00:07:11.623\nthat has penetrated your brain,\n\n00:07:11.647 --> 00:07:16.237\nstaying there and taking up\nall the space inside.\n\n00:07:17.499 --> 00:07:20.148\nAnd there are people --\nmen, women,\n\n00:07:20.816 --> 00:07:23.454\nwho suddenly no longer sleep.\n\n00:07:24.334 --> 00:07:26.679\nAnd they experience\nhorrible anxiety attacks --\n\n00:07:26.703 --> 00:07:29.733\npanic attacks, not just minor fears.\n\n00:07:29.757 --> 00:07:32.063\nThey suddenly don't want to sleep,\n\n00:07:32.087 --> 00:07:36.621\nbecause when they do, they have\nthe same nightmare every night.\n\n00:07:36.645 --> 00:07:38.565\nThey see the same image every night.\n\n00:07:38.589 --> 00:07:40.216\nWhat type of image?\n\n00:07:40.240 --> 00:07:43.043\nFor example, a soldier\nwho enters a building\n\n00:07:43.067 --> 00:07:45.901\nand comes face to face\nwith another soldier aiming at him.\n\n00:07:45.925 --> 00:07:48.488\nHe looks at the gun,\nstraight down the barrel.\n\n00:07:48.512 --> 00:07:52.096\nAnd this barrel suddenly\nbecomes enormous, deformed.\n\n00:07:52.120 --> 00:07:54.874\nIt becomes fluffy, swallowing everything.\n\n00:07:54.898 --> 00:07:56.498\nAnd he says --\n\n00:07:58.334 --> 00:08:00.676\nlater he will say, \"I saw death.\n\n00:08:00.700 --> 00:08:03.201\nI saw myself dead, therefore I'm dead.\"\n\n00:08:03.225 --> 00:08:07.082\nAnd from then on, he knows he is dead.\n\n00:08:07.106 --> 00:08:11.991\nIt is not a perception --\nhe is convinced that he is dead.\n\n00:08:12.015 --> 00:08:15.547\nIn reality, someone came in,\nthe guy left or didn't shoot, whatever,\n\n00:08:15.571 --> 00:08:17.218\nand he didn't actually get shot --\n\n00:08:17.242 --> 00:08:18.950\nbut to him, he died in that moment.\n\n00:08:18.974 --> 00:08:21.081\nOr it can be the smell\nof a mass grave --\n\n00:08:21.105 --> 00:08:22.910\nI saw a lot of that in Rwanda.\n\n00:08:23.468 --> 00:08:26.460\nIt can be the voice of a friend calling,\n\n00:08:27.071 --> 00:08:30.831\nand they're being slaughtered\nand there's nothing you can do.\n\n00:08:30.855 --> 00:08:32.061\nYou hear that voice,\n\n00:08:32.085 --> 00:08:37.591\nand you wake up every night --\nfor weeks, months --\n\n00:08:37.615 --> 00:08:40.372\nin a trance-like state,\nanxious and terrified,\n\n00:08:40.396 --> 00:08:41.751\nlike a child.\n\n00:08:41.775 --> 00:08:43.354\nI have seen men cry --\n\n00:08:44.610 --> 00:08:45.973\njust like children --\n\n00:08:46.400 --> 00:08:48.096\nfrom seeing the same image.\n\n00:08:48.120 --> 00:08:52.886\nSo having that image\nof horror in your brain,\n\n00:08:54.617 --> 00:08:56.455\nseeing the void of death --\n\n00:08:56.479 --> 00:09:00.184\nthat analogue of horror\nwhich is hiding something --\n\n00:09:00.208 --> 00:09:01.462\nwill completely take over.\n\n00:09:01.486 --> 00:09:03.793\nYou cannot do anything, anything at all.\n\n00:09:03.817 --> 00:09:05.111\nYou cannot work anymore,\n\n00:09:05.135 --> 00:09:06.418\nyou cannot love anymore.\n\n00:09:06.442 --> 00:09:08.369\nYou go home and don't recognize anyone.\n\n00:09:08.393 --> 00:09:10.400\nYou don't even recognize yourself.\n\n00:09:13.139 --> 00:09:16.663\nYou hide and don't leave the house,\nyou lock yourself in, you become ill.\n\n00:09:16.687 --> 00:09:21.101\nI know people who placed small cans\noutside their house with coins inside,\n\n00:09:21.125 --> 00:09:22.991\nin case someone tried to get in.\n\n00:09:23.015 --> 00:09:25.887\nAll of a sudden, you feel\nlike you want to die or kill\n\n00:09:25.911 --> 00:09:27.459\nor hide or run away.\n\n00:09:27.483 --> 00:09:29.634\nYou want to be loved,\nbut you hate everyone.\n\n00:09:29.658 --> 00:09:33.571\nIt's a feeling that seizes you entirely\n\n00:09:34.602 --> 00:09:36.333\nday in and day out,\n\n00:09:36.357 --> 00:09:40.261\nand you suffer tremendously.\n\n00:09:41.309 --> 00:09:42.786\nAnd no one understands.\n\n00:09:42.810 --> 00:09:46.578\nThey say, \"There's nothing wrong with you.\nYou seem fine, you have no injuries.\n\n00:09:46.602 --> 00:09:49.096\nYou went to war, came back; you're fine.\"\n\n00:09:50.189 --> 00:09:52.071\nThese people suffer tremendously.\n\n00:09:52.095 --> 00:09:53.674\nSome commit suicide.\n\n00:09:53.993 --> 00:09:56.707\nAfter all, suicide is like updating\nyour daily planner --\n\n00:09:56.731 --> 00:09:59.042\nI'm already dead,\nI might as well commit suicide.\n\n00:09:59.066 --> 00:10:01.001\nPlus, there is no more pain.\n\n00:10:01.025 --> 00:10:05.055\nSome commit suicide,\nothers end up under the bridge, drinking.\n\n00:10:05.079 --> 00:10:09.451\nEveryone remembers\nthat grandfather or uncle or neighbor\n\n00:10:09.475 --> 00:10:11.445\nwho used to drink, never said a word,\n\n00:10:11.469 --> 00:10:13.238\nalways in a bad mood, beat his wife\n\n00:10:13.262 --> 00:10:17.391\nand who would end up either sinking\ninto alcoholism or dying.\n\n00:10:17.415 --> 00:10:20.195\nAnd why do we not talk about this?\n\n00:10:20.219 --> 00:10:23.338\nWe don't talk about it because it's taboo.\n\n00:10:24.115 --> 00:10:27.882\nIt's not like we don't have the words\nto express the void of death.\n\n00:10:27.906 --> 00:10:29.674\nBut others don't want hear it.\n\n00:10:29.698 --> 00:10:31.812\nThe first time I returned\nfrom an assignment,\n\n00:10:31.836 --> 00:10:33.362\nThey said, \"Oh! He's back.\"\n\n00:10:33.386 --> 00:10:36.482\nThere was a fancy dinner --\nwhite tablecloth, candles, guests.\n\n00:10:36.506 --> 00:10:37.698\n\"Tell us everything!\"\n\n00:10:37.722 --> 00:10:39.045\nWhich I did.\n\n00:10:40.033 --> 00:10:42.517\nAfter 20 minutes, people\nwere giving me dirty looks,\n\n00:10:42.541 --> 00:10:44.546\nthe hostess had her nose in the ashtray.\n\n00:10:44.570 --> 00:10:47.541\nIt was horrible and I realized\nI ruined the whole evening.\n\n00:10:47.565 --> 00:10:49.474\nSo I don't talk about it anymore.\n\n00:10:49.498 --> 00:10:51.039\nWe're just not ready to listen.\n\n00:10:51.063 --> 00:10:52.791\nPeople say outright: \"Please, stop.\"\n\n00:10:52.815 --> 00:10:54.912\nIs that a rare occurrence?\n\n00:10:54.936 --> 00:10:57.338\nNo, it's extremely common.\n\n00:10:57.362 --> 00:10:59.515\nOne third of the soldiers\nwho died in Iraq --\n\n00:10:59.539 --> 00:11:02.061\nwell, not \"died,\" let me re-phrase that --\n\n00:11:02.085 --> 00:11:05.225\none third of the US soldiers\nwho went to Iraq\n\n00:11:05.249 --> 00:11:06.887\nsuffer from PTSD.\n\n00:11:06.911 --> 00:11:12.832\nIn 1939, there were still 200,000 soldiers\nfrom the First World War\n\n00:11:12.856 --> 00:11:16.231\nthat were being treated\nin British psychiatric hospitals.\n\n00:11:17.024 --> 00:11:19.458\nIn Vietnam, 54,000 people died --\n\n00:11:19.482 --> 00:11:20.825\nAmericans.\n\n00:11:20.849 --> 00:11:25.022\nIn 1987, the US government\nidentified 102,000 --\n\n00:11:25.046 --> 00:11:26.260\ntwice as many --\n\n00:11:26.284 --> 00:11:28.908\n102,000 veterans who died\nfrom committing suicide.\n\n00:11:28.932 --> 00:11:31.748\nTwice as many deaths by suicide\nthan by combat in Vietnam.\n\n00:11:31.772 --> 00:11:34.930\nSo you see, this relates to everything,\n\n00:11:34.954 --> 00:11:37.293\nnot just modern warfare,\nbut also ancient wars --\n\n00:11:37.317 --> 00:11:40.316\nyou can read about it,\nthe evidence is there.\n\n00:11:40.340 --> 00:11:42.585\nSo why do we not talk about it?\n\n00:11:42.609 --> 00:11:45.054\nWhy have we not talked about it?\n\n00:11:45.078 --> 00:11:49.546\nThe problem is that\nif you don't talk about it,\n\n00:11:50.600 --> 00:11:52.195\nyou're heading for disaster.\n\n00:11:53.486 --> 00:11:56.301\nThe only way to heal --\n\n00:11:56.325 --> 00:11:59.523\nand the good news here\nis that this is treatable --\n\n00:12:00.787 --> 00:12:02.858\nthink Munch's The Scream, Goya, etc. --\n\n00:12:02.882 --> 00:12:04.167\nit's indeed treatable.\n\n00:12:04.191 --> 00:12:08.751\nThe only way to heal from this trauma,\n\n00:12:08.775 --> 00:12:13.831\nfrom this encounter with death\nthat overwhelms, petrifies and kills you\n\n00:12:13.855 --> 00:12:17.855\nis to find a way to express it.\n\n00:12:18.498 --> 00:12:20.237\nPeople used to say,\n\n00:12:20.261 --> 00:12:23.828\n\"Language is the only thing\nthat holds all of us together.\"\n\n00:12:23.852 --> 00:12:26.193\nWithout language, we're nothing.\n\n00:12:26.217 --> 00:12:28.834\nIt's the thing that makes us human.\n\n00:12:28.858 --> 00:12:30.835\nIn the face of such a horrible image --\n\n00:12:30.859 --> 00:12:36.385\na wordless image of oblivion\nthat obsesses us --\n\n00:12:36.409 --> 00:12:38.868\nthe only way to cope with it\n\n00:12:40.067 --> 00:12:42.168\nis to put human words to it.\n\n00:12:42.192 --> 00:12:44.618\nBecause these people\nfeel excluded from humanity.\n\n00:12:44.642 --> 00:12:47.848\nNo one wants to see them anymore\nand they don't want to see anyone.\n\n00:12:47.872 --> 00:12:50.293\nThey feel dirty, defiled, ashamed.\n\n00:12:50.317 --> 00:12:53.561\nSomeone said, \"Doctor,\nI don't use the subway anymore\n\n00:12:53.585 --> 00:12:56.799\nbecause I'm afraid people\nwill see the horror in my eyes.\"\n\n00:12:56.823 --> 00:12:59.689\nAnother guy thought he had\na terrible skin disease\n\n00:12:59.713 --> 00:13:03.550\nand spent six months with dermatologists,\ngoing from doctor to doctor.\n\n00:13:03.574 --> 00:13:06.113\nAnd then one day, they sent him\nto a psychiatrist.\n\n00:13:06.137 --> 00:13:08.542\nDuring his second session,\nhe told the psychiatrist\n\n00:13:08.566 --> 00:13:10.896\nhe had a terrible skin disease\nfrom head to toe.\n\n00:13:10.920 --> 00:13:13.839\nThe psychiatrist asked,\n\"Why are you in this state?\"\n\n00:13:13.863 --> 00:13:17.189\nAnd the man said, \"Well, because\nI'm dead, so I must be rotting away.\"\n\n00:13:17.213 --> 00:13:21.626\nSo you see this is something\nthat has a profound effect on people.\n\n00:13:21.650 --> 00:13:24.059\nIn order to heal,\nwe need to talk about it.\n\n00:13:24.083 --> 00:13:28.027\nThe horror needs to be put into words --\n\n00:13:28.051 --> 00:13:32.234\nhuman words, so we can organize it\nand talk about it again.\n\n00:13:32.258 --> 00:13:36.400\nWe have to look death in the face.\n\n00:13:37.019 --> 00:13:42.114\nAnd if we can do that,\nif we can talk about these things,\n\n00:13:42.138 --> 00:13:45.563\nthen step by step,\nby working it out verbally,\n\n00:13:45.587 --> 00:13:48.515\nwe can reclaim our place in humanity.\n\n00:13:49.507 --> 00:13:50.771\nAnd it is important.\n\n00:13:50.795 --> 00:13:52.483\nSilence kills us.\n\n00:13:53.747 --> 00:13:55.169\nSo what does this mean?\n\n00:13:55.193 --> 00:13:57.209\nIt means that after a trauma,\n\n00:13:57.233 --> 00:14:00.868\nwithout question, we lose\nour \"unbearable lightness of being,\"\n\n00:14:00.892 --> 00:14:03.646\nthat sense of immortality\nthat keeps us here --\n\n00:14:03.670 --> 00:14:07.582\nmeaning, if we're here, we almost feel\nlike we're immortal, which we're not,\n\n00:14:07.606 --> 00:14:10.949\nbut if we didn't believe that,\nwe'd say, \"What's the point of it all?\"\n\n00:14:10.973 --> 00:14:13.763\nBut trauma survivors have lost\nthat feeling of immortality.\n\n00:14:13.787 --> 00:14:15.182\nThey've lost their lightness.\n\n00:14:15.206 --> 00:14:16.945\nBut they have found something else.\n\n00:14:16.969 --> 00:14:20.229\nSo this means that if we manage\nto look death in the face,\n\n00:14:21.504 --> 00:14:26.406\nand actually confront it,\nrather than keep quiet and hide,\n\n00:14:26.430 --> 00:14:28.909\nlike some of the men or women I know did,\n\n00:14:28.933 --> 00:14:35.587\nsuch as Michael from Rwanda,\nCarole from Iraq, Philippe from the Congo\n\n00:14:35.611 --> 00:14:36.837\nand other people I know,\n\n00:14:36.861 --> 00:14:38.959\nlike Sorj Chalandon, now a great writer,\n\n00:14:38.983 --> 00:14:41.274\nwho gave up field assignments\nafter a trauma.\n\n00:14:41.298 --> 00:14:43.516\nFive friends of mine committed suicide,\n\n00:14:43.540 --> 00:14:46.116\nthey're the ones\nwho did not survive the trauma.\n\n00:14:46.140 --> 00:14:51.686\nSo if we can look death in the face,\n\n00:14:51.710 --> 00:14:54.488\nif we, mortal humans, human mortals,\n\n00:14:54.512 --> 00:14:57.353\nunderstand that we are human\nand mortal, mortal and human,\n\n00:14:57.377 --> 00:15:03.624\nif we can confront death\nand identify it once again\n\n00:15:03.648 --> 00:15:06.711\nas the most mysterious place\nof all mysterious places,\n\n00:15:07.528 --> 00:15:10.084\nsince no one has ever seen it --\n\n00:15:10.108 --> 00:15:12.771\nif we can give it back this meaning,\n\n00:15:12.795 --> 00:15:15.636\nyes, we may die,\n\n00:15:17.644 --> 00:15:19.239\nsurvive\n\n00:15:19.969 --> 00:15:21.396\nand come back to life,\n\n00:15:21.420 --> 00:15:24.513\nbut we'll come back stronger than before.\n\n00:15:24.537 --> 00:15:25.847\nMuch stronger.\n\n00:15:25.871 --> 00:15:27.025\nThank you.\n\n00:15:27.049 -->

is the Air Jordan 3 Black Cement. This might be the most important sneaker in history. First released in 1988, this is the shoe that started Nike marketing as we know it. This is the shoe that propelled the entire Air Jordan lineage, and perhaps saved Nike. The Air Jordan 3 Black Cement did for sneakers what the iPhone did for phones. It's been re-released four times. Every celebrity's been seen wearing it. There's a site about what to wear with the Black Cement. It's been right under your nose for decades and you never looked down. And right about now, most of you are probably thinking, \"Sneakers?\"(Laughter)Yes. Yes, sneakers. Some extraordinary things about sneakers and data and Nike and how they're all related, possibly, to the future of all online commerce.In 2011, the last time the Jordan 3 Black Cement was released, at a retail of 160 dollars, it sold out globally in minutes. And that's because people were camped outside of sneaker stores for days before it went on sale. And just minutes after that, thousands of those pairs were on eBay for two and three times retail. In fact, there's over 1,000 pairs on eBay right now, four years later. But here's the thing: this happens every single Saturday. Every week there's another release or two or three, and every shoe has a story as rich and compelling as the Jordan 3 Black Cement.This is Nike building the marketplace for sneakerheads \u2014 people who collect sneakers \u2014 and my daughter.(Laughter)That's an \"I love Dad\" T-shirt.For the brands, sneakerheads are a very important demographic. These are the tastemakers; these are the Apple fanboys. Because who else is going to buy a pair of $8,000 Back to the Future sneakers?(Laughter)Yeah, 8,000 dollars.And while that's obviously the anomaly, the resell sneaker market is definitely not. Thirty years in the making, what started as an underground culture of a few people who like sneakers just a bit too much \u2014(Laughter)Now we have sneaker addictions. In a market where in the past 12 months, there have been over nine million pairs of shoes resold in the United States alone, at a value of 1.2 billion dollars. And that's a conservative estimate \u2014 I should know, I am a sneakerhead. This is my collection. In the pantheon of great collections, mine doesn't even register. I have about 250 pairs, but trust me, I am small-time. People have thousands.I'm a very typical 37-year-old sneakerhead. I grew up playing basketball when Michael Jordan played, I always wanted Air Jordans, my mother would never buy me Air Jordans, as soon as I got some money I bought Air Jordans \u2014 literally, we all have the exact same story. But here's where mine diverged. After starting three companies, I took a job as a strategy consultant, when I very quickly realized that I didn't know the first thing about data. But I learned, because I had to, and I liked it. So I thought, I wonder if I could get ahold of some sneaker data, just to play with for my own amusement. The goal was to develop a price guide, a real data-driven view of the market. And four years later, we're analyzing over 25 million transactions, providing real-time analytics on thousands of sneakers. Now sneakerheads check prices while camping out for releases. Others have used the data to validate insurance claims. And the top investment banks in the world now use resell data to analyze the retail footwear industry. And here's the best part: sneakerheads have sneaker portfolios.(Laughter)Sneakerheads can track the value of their collection over time, compare it to others, and have access to the same analytics you might for your online brokerage account. So sneakerhead Dan builds his collection and identifies which 352 are his. He can see it's worth 103,000 dollars \u2014 frankly, a modest collection. At the asset level, he can see gain-loss by shoe. Here he's made over 600 dollars on one pair. I have one of those.(Laughter)So an unregulated 1.2 billion dollar industry that thrives as much on the street as it does online, and has spawned fundamental financial services for sneakers? At some point I asked myself what's really going on in the market, and two comparisons started to emerge. Are sneakers more like stocks or drugs?(Laughter)In fact, one guy emailed to say he thought his 15-year-old son was selling drugs and later found out he was selling sneakers.(Laughter)And now they use the data to do it together. And that's because sneakers are an investment opportunity where none other exists. And I don't just mean the kid selling sneakers instead of drugs. How about all kids? You have to be 18 to play the stock market. I sold chewing gum in sixth grade, Blow Pops in ninth grade and collected baseball cards through high school. The cards are long dead, and the candy market's usually quite local.For a lot of people, sneakers are a legal and accessible investment opportunity \u2014 a democratized stock market, but also unregulated. Which is why the story you're probably most familiar with is people killing each other for sneakers. And while that definitely happens and is tragic, it's not nearly the epidemic some media would have you believe. In fact, it's a very small piece of a much bigger and better story.So sneakers have clear similarities to both the stock exchange and the illegal drug trade, but perhaps the most fundamental is the existence of a central actor. Someone is making the rules. In the case of sneakers, that someone is Nike.Let me walk you through some numbers.The resell market, we know, is $1.2 billion. Nike, including Jordan brand, accounts for 96 percent of all shoes sold on the secondary market. Just complete domination. Sneakerheads love Jordans. And profit on the secondary market is about a third. That means that sneakerheads made 380 million dollars selling Nikes last year. Let's jump to retail for a second. Skechers, earlier this year, became the number two footwear brand in the country, surpassing Adidas \u2014 this was a big deal. And in the 12 months ending in June, Skechers's net income was 209 million dollars. That means that Nike's customers make almost twice as much profit as their closest competitor. That \u2014(Laughter)How is that even possible?The sneaker market is just supply and demand, but Nike's gotten very good at using supply \u2014 limited sneakers \u2014 and the distribution of those sneakers to their own benefit. So it's really just supply. Sneakerheads joke that as long as it's limited and Nike, they'll buy it. Shoes that sell for 8,000 dollars do so because they're very rare. It's no different than any other collectible market, only this isn't a market at all. It's a false construct created by Nike \u2014 ingeniously created by Nike, in the most positive sense \u2014 to sell more shoes. And in the process, it provided tens of thousands of people with life-long passions, myself included. If Nike wanted to kill the resell market, they could do so tomorrow, all they have to do is release more shoes. But we certainly don't want them to, nor is it in their best interest. That's because unlike Apple, who will sell an iPhone to anyone who wants one, Nike doesn't make their money by just selling $200 sneakers. They sell millions of shoes to millions of people for 60 dollars. And sneakerheads are the ones who drive the marketing and the hype and the PR and the brand cachet, and enable Nike to sell millions of $60 sneakers.It's marketing. It's marketing the likes of which has never been seen before \u2014 this isn't in any textbook. For 15 years Nike has propped up an artificial commodities market, with a Facebook-level hyped IPO every single weekend. Drive by any Footlocker at 8am on a Saturday morning, and there will be a line down the street and around the block, and sometimes those kids have been waiting there all week. You know those crazy iPhone lines you see on the news every other year? Nike lines happen 104 times more often. So Nike sets the rules. And they do so by controlling supply and distribution.But once a pair leaves the retail channel, it's the Wild West. There are very few \u2014 if any \u2014 legal, unregulated markets of this size. So Nike is definitely not the stock exchange. In fact, there is no central exchange. By last count, there were 48 different online markets that I know of. Some are eBay clones, some are mobile markets, and then you have consignment shops and brick-and-mortar stores, and sneaker conventions, and reseller sites, and Facebook and Instagram and Twitter \u2014 literally, anywhere sneakerheads come into contact with each other, shoes will be bought and sold.But that means no efficiencies, no transparency, sometimes not even authenticity. Can you imagine if that's how stocks were bought? What if the way to buy a share of Apple stock was to search over 100 places online and off, including every time you walk down the street just hoping to pass someone wearing some Apple stock? Never knowing who had the best price, or even if the stock you were looking at was real. That would surely make you say:[WTF?]Of course that's not how we buy stock. But what if that's not how we need to buy sneakers either? What if the inverse is true, and what if we could buy sneakers exactly the same way as we buy stock? And what if it wasn't just sneakers, but any similar product, like watches and handbags and women's shoes, and any collectible, any seasonal item and any markdown item? What if there was a stock market for commerce? A stock market of things. And not only could you buy in a much more educated and efficient manner, but you could engage in all the sophisticated financial transactions you can with the stock market. Shorts and options and futures and well, maybe you see where this is going. Maybe you want to invest in a stock market of things. Because if you had invested in a pair of Air Jordan 3 Black Cement in 2011, you could either be wearing them onstage,(Laughter)or have earned 162 percent on your money \u2014 double the S&P and 20 percent more than Apple.(Laughter)And that's why we're talking about sneakers.Thank you.(Applause)", "id": 2371, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:13.307

--> 00:02:30.875\nthe resell sneaker market\nis definitely not.\n\n00:02:30.899 --> 00:02:32.723\nThirty years in the making,\n\n00:02:32.747 --> 00:02:34.683\nwhat started as an underground culture\n\n00:02:34.707 --> 00:02:37.688\nof a few people who like sneakers\njust a bit too much --\n\n00:02:37.712 --> 00:02:39.112\n(Laughter)\n\n00:02:40.482 --> 00:02:42.692\nNow we have sneaker addictions.\n\n00:02:42.716 --> 00:02:44.644\nIn a market where in the past 12 months,\n\n00:02:44.668 --> 00:02:46.922\nthere have been over\nnine million pairs of shoes\n\n00:02:46.946 --> 00:02:49.339\nresold in the United States alone,\n\n00:02:49.363 --> 00:02:53.603\nat a value of 1.2 billion dollars.\n\n00:02:53.627 --> 00:02:55.666\nAnd that's a conservative estimate --\n\n00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:58.893\nI should know, I am a sneakerhead.\n\n00:02:58.917 --> 00:03:00.424\nThis is my collection.\n\n00:03:00.939 --> 00:03:04.834\nIn the pantheon of great collections,\nmine doesn't even register.\n\n00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:08.396\nI have about 250 pairs,\nbut trust me, I am small-time.\n\n00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:10.375\nPeople have thousands.\n\n00:03:10.717 --> 00:03:13.401\nI'm a very typical\n37-year-old sneakerhead.\n\n00:03:14.097 --> 00:03:16.730\nI grew up playing basketball\nwhen Michael Jordan played,\n\n00:03:16.754 --> 00:03:18.094\nI always wanted Air Jordans,\n\n00:03:18.118 --> 00:03:20.087\nmy mother would never buy me Air Jordans,\n\n00:03:20.111 --> 00:03:22.504\nas soon as I got some money\nI bought Air Jordans --\n\n00:03:22.528 --> 00:03:24.601\nliterally, we all have\nthe exact same story.\n\n00:03:24.625 --> 00:03:26.320\nBut here's where mine diverged.\n\n00:03:27.124 --> 00:03:31.219\nAfter starting three companies,\nI took a job as a strategy consultant,\n\n00:03:31.243 --> 00:03:35.157\nwhen I very quickly realized that\nI didn't know the first thing about data.\n\n00:03:35.908 --> 00:03:38.696\nBut I learned, because I had to,\n\n00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:40.014\nand I liked it.\n\n00:03:40.038 --> 00:03:43.450\nSo I thought, I wonder if I could\nget ahold of some sneaker data,\n\n00:03:43.474 --> 00:03:45.486\njust to play with for my own amusement.\n\n00:03:45.907 --> 00:03:47.780\nThe goal was to develop a price guide,\n\n00:03:47.804 --> 00:03:50.001\na real data-driven view of the market.\n\n00:03:50.331 --> 00:03:54.660\nAnd four years later, we're analyzing\nover 25 million transactions,\n\n00:03:54.684 --> 00:03:57.600\nproviding real-time analytics\non thousands of sneakers.\n\n00:03:58.289 --> 00:04:01.840\nNow sneakerheads check prices\nwhile camping out for releases.\n\n00:04:02.498 --> 00:04:05.648\nOthers have used the data\nto validate insurance claims.\n\n00:04:06.739 --> 00:04:08.720\nAnd the top investment banks in the world\n\n00:04:08.744 --> 00:04:13.350\nnow use resell data to analyze\nthe retail footwear industry.\n\n00:04:13.374 --> 00:04:14.964\nAnd here's the best part:\n\n00:04:14.988 --> 00:04:18.517\nsneakerheads have sneaker portfolios.\n\n00:04:18.541 --> 00:04:20.043\n(Laughter)\n\n00:04:20.575 --> 00:04:23.548\nSneakerheads can track the value\nof their collection over time,\n\n00:04:23.572 --> 00:04:24.723\ncompare it to others,\n\n00:04:24.747 --> 00:04:26.977\nand have access to the same\nanalytics you might\n\n00:04:27.001 --> 00:04:28.921\nfor your online brokerage account.\n\n00:04:28.945 --> 00:04:33.849\nSo sneakerhead Dan builds his collection\nand identifies which 352 are his.\n\n00:04:33.873 --> 00:04:36.762\nHe can see it's worth 103,000 dollars --\n\n00:04:36.786 --> 00:04:38.787\nfrankly, a modest collection.\n\n00:04:38.811 --> 00:04:42.420\nAt the asset level,\nhe can see gain-loss by shoe.\n\n00:04:42.444 --> 00:04:44.958\nHere he's made over\n600 dollars on one pair.\n\n00:04:46.141 --> 00:04:47.472\nI have one of those.\n\n00:04:47.496 --> 00:04:49.075\n(Laughter)\n\n00:04:50.613 --> 00:04:54.060\nSo an unregulated\n1.2 billion dollar industry\n\n00:04:54.084 --> 00:04:56.653\nthat thrives as much on the street\nas it does online,\n\n00:04:56.677 --> 00:05:00.423\nand has spawned fundamental\nfinancial services for sneakers?\n\n00:05:01.071 --> 00:05:04.207\nAt some point I asked myself\nwhat's really going on in the market,\n\n00:05:04.231 --> 00:05:06.546\nand two comparisons started to emerge.\n\n00:05:06.570 --> 00:05:10.321\nAre sneakers more like stocks or drugs?\n\n00:05:10.345 --> 00:05:11.546\n(Laughter)\n\n00:05:11.570 --> 00:05:13.438\nIn fact, one guy emailed to say\n\n00:05:13.462 --> 00:05:17.726\nhe thought his 15-year-old son\nwas selling drugs\n\n00:05:17.750 --> 00:05:20.281\nand later found out\nhe was selling sneakers.\n\n00:05:20.811 --> 00:05:21.972\n(Laughter)\n\n00:05:22.715 --> 00:05:25.246\nAnd now they use the data\nto do it together.\n\n00:05:25.669 --> 00:05:28.367\nAnd that's because sneakers\nare an investment opportunity\n\n00:05:28.391 --> 00:05:29.550\nwhere none other exists.\n\n00:05:29.574 --> 00:05:32.611\nAnd I don't just mean the kid\nselling sneakers instead of drugs.\n\n00:05:32.635 --> 00:05:34.325\nHow about all kids?\n\n00:05:34.349 --> 00:05:37.102\nYou have to be 18\nto play the stock market.\n\n00:05:37.925 --> 00:05:40.265\nI sold chewing gum in sixth grade,\n\n00:05:40.289 --> 00:05:41.867\nBlow Pops in ninth grade\n\n00:05:41.891 --> 00:05:44.312\nand collected baseball cards\nthrough high school.\n\n00:05:44.336 --> 00:05:46.133\nThe cards are long dead,\n\n00:05:46.157 --> 00:05:48.530\nand the candy market's\nusually quite local.\n\n00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:54.807\nFor a lot of people, sneakers are a legal\nand accessible investment opportunity --\n\n00:05:54.831 --> 00:05:58.598\na democratized stock market,\n\n00:05:58.622 --> 00:06:00.693\nbut also unregulated.\n\n00:06:00.717 --> 00:06:03.499\nWhich is why the story\nyou're probably most familiar with\n\n00:06:03.523 --> 00:06:05.938\nis people killing each other for sneakers.\n\n00:06:06.564 --> 00:06:10.339\nAnd while that definitely\nhappens and is tragic,\n\n00:06:10.363 --> 00:06:14.208\nit's not nearly the epidemic\nsome media would have you believe.\n\n00:06:14.232 --> 00:06:18.417\nIn fact, it's a very small piece\nof a much bigger and better story.\n\n00:06:18.441 --> 00:06:20.137\nSo sneakers have clear similarities\n\n00:06:20.161 --> 00:06:23.265\nto both the stock exchange\nand the illegal drug trade,\n\n00:06:23.289 --> 00:06:27.686\nbut perhaps the most fundamental\nis the existence of a central actor.\n\n00:06:27.710 --> 00:06:29.693\nSomeone is making the rules.\n\n00:06:30.946 --> 00:06:34.939\nIn the case of sneakers,\nthat someone is Nike.\n\n00:06:35.868 --> 00:06:38.120\nLet me walk you through some numbers.\n\n00:06:38.144 --> 00:06:41.380\nThe resell market,\nwe know, is $1.2 billion.\n\n00:06:41.404 --> 00:06:43.702\nNike, including Jordan brand,\n\n00:06:43.726 --> 00:06:48.242\naccounts for 96 percent of all shoes\nsold on the secondary market.\n\n00:06:48.266 --> 00:06:49.858\nJust complete domination.\n\n00:06:49.882 --> 00:06:52.470\nSneakerheads love Jordans.\n\n00:06:52.494 --> 00:06:55.505\nAnd profit on the secondary market\nis about a third.\n\n00:06:55.529 --> 00:07:00.599\nThat means that sneakerheads\nmade 380 million dollars\n\n00:07:00.623 --> 00:07:02.511\nselling Nikes last year.\n\n00:07:02.988 --> 00:07:05.005\nLet's jump to retail for a second.\n\n00:07:05.029 --> 00:07:06.449\nSkechers, earlier this year,\n\n00:07:06.473 --> 00:07:09.263\nbecame the number two\nfootwear brand in the country,\n\n00:07:09.287 --> 00:07:12.121\nsurpassing Adidas --\nthis was a big deal.\n\n00:07:12.145 --> 00:07:14.919\nAnd in the 12 months ending in June,\n\n00:07:14.943 --> 00:07:19.007\nSkechers's net income\nwas 209 million dollars.\n\n00:07:19.811 --> 00:07:23.145\nThat means that Nike's customers\n\n00:07:23.169 --> 00:07:26.705\nmake almost twice as much profit\nas their closest competitor.\n\n00:07:27.716 --> 00:07:29.515\nThat --\n\n00:07:29.539 --> 00:07:32.963\n(Laughter)\n\n00:07:32.987 --> 00:07:34.563\nHow is that even possible?\n\n00:07:36.207 --> 00:07:38.788\nThe sneaker market\nis just supply and demand,\n\n00:07:38.812 --> 00:07:43.534\nbut Nike's gotten very good at using\nsupply -- limited sneakers --\n\n00:07:43.558 --> 00:07:47.371\nand the distribution of those sneakers\nto their own benefit.\n\n00:07:47.395 --> 00:07:49.407\nSo it's really just supply.\n\n00:07:49.431 --> 00:07:53.196\nSneakerheads joke that as long\nas it's limited and Nike, they'll buy it.\n\n00:07:53.220 --> 00:07:57.029\nShoes that sell for 8,000 dollars\ndo so because they're very rare.\n\n00:07:57.053 --> 00:07:59.819\nIt's no different than any other\ncollectible market,\n\n00:07:59.843 --> 00:08:02.923\nonly this isn't a market at all.\n\n00:08:03.466 --> 00:08:05.911\nIt's a false construct created by Nike --\n\n00:08:05.935 --> 00:08:10.216\ningeniously created by Nike, in the most\npositive sense -- to sell more shoes.\n\n00:08:10.571 --> 00:08:11.722\nAnd in the process,\n\n00:08:11.746 --> 00:08:15.114\nit provided tens of thousands of people\nwith life-long passions,\n\n00:08:15.138 --> 00:08:16.619\nmyself included.\n\n00:08:17.446 --> 00:08:20.661\nIf Nike wanted to kill the resell market,\nthey could do so tomorrow,\n\n00:08:20.685 --> 00:08:22.717\nall they have to do is release more shoes.\n\n00:08:22.741 --> 00:08:26.258\nBut we certainly don't want them to,\nnor is it in their best interest.\n\n00:08:27.303 --> 00:08:31.540\nThat's because unlike Apple, who will sell\nan iPhone to anyone who wants one,\n\n00:08:31.564 --> 00:08:35.382\nNike doesn't make their money\nby just selling $200 sneakers.\n\n00:08:35.406 --> 00:08:38.657\nThey sell millions of shoes to millions\nof people for 60 dollars.\n\n00:08:39.104 --> 00:08:41.643\nAnd sneakerheads are the ones\nwho drive the marketing\n\n00:08:41.667 --> 00:08:44.197\nand the hype and the PR\nand the brand cachet,\n\n00:08:44.221 --> 00:08:47.761\nand enable Nike to sell millions\nof $60 sneakers.\n\n00:08:49.459 --> 00:08:50.840\nIt's marketing.\n\n00:08:50.864 --> 00:08:53.976\nIt's marketing the likes of which\nhas never been seen before --\n\n00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:55.420\nthis isn't in any textbook.\n\n00:08:55.444 --> 00:08:58.984\nFor 15 years Nike has propped up\nan artificial commodities market,\n\n00:08:59.008 --> 00:09:03.471\nwith a Facebook-level hyped IPO\nevery single weekend.\n\n00:09:03.495 --> 00:09:06.168\nDrive by any Footlocker at 8am\non a Saturday morning,\n\n00:09:06.192 --> 00:09:09.143\nand there will be a line down the street\nand around the block,\n\n00:09:09.167 --> 00:09:12.028\nand sometimes those kids\nhave been waiting there all week.\n\n00:09:12.395 --> 00:09:16.166\nYou know those crazy iPhone lines\nyou see on the news every other year?\n\n00:09:16.190 --> 00:09:20.480\nNike lines happen 104 times more often.\n\n00:09:21.033 --> 00:09:22.561\nSo Nike sets the rules.\n\n00:09:22.585 --> 00:09:25.359\nAnd they do so by controlling\nsupply and distribution.\n\n00:09:25.972 --> 00:09:29.869\nBut once a pair leaves\nthe retail channel, it's the Wild West.\n\n00:09:30.458 --> 00:09:35.961\nThere are very few -- if any --\nlegal, unregulated markets of this size.\n\n00:09:36.438 --> 00:09:39.761\nSo Nike is definitely\nnot the stock exchange.\n\n00:09:39.785 --> 00:09:42.568\nIn fact, there is no central exchange.\n\n00:09:42.592 --> 00:09:47.330\nBy last count, there were 48 different\nonline markets that I know of.\n\n00:09:48.568 --> 00:09:51.436\nSome are eBay clones,\nsome are mobile markets,\n\n00:09:51.460 --> 00:09:54.482\nand then you have consignment shops\nand brick-and-mortar stores,\n\n00:09:54.506 --> 00:09:56.570\nand sneaker conventions,\nand reseller sites,\n\n00:09:56.594 --> 00:09:58.999\nand Facebook and Instagram and Twitter --\n\n00:09:59.023 --> 00:10:02.555\nliterally, anywhere sneakerheads\ncome into contact with each other,\n\n00:10:02.579 --> 00:10:04.569\nshoes will be bought and sold.\n\n00:10:05.462 --> 00:10:10.473\nBut that means no efficiencies,\nno transparency,\n\n00:10:10.497 --> 00:10:12.713\nsometimes not even authenticity.\n\n00:10:13.542 --> 00:10:16.335\nCan you imagine if that's\nhow stocks were bought?\n\n00:10:17.083 --> 00:10:19.367\nWhat if the way to buy\na share of Apple stock\n\n00:10:19.391 --> 00:10:22.246\nwas to search over 100 places\nonline and off,\n\n00:10:22.270 --> 00:10:24.493\nincluding every time\nyou walk down the street\n\n00:10:24.517 --> 00:10:27.155\njust hoping to pass someone\nwearing some Apple stock?\n\n00:10:27.179 --> 00:10:29.046\nNever knowing who had the best price,\n\n00:10:29.070 --> 00:10:31.637\nor even if the stock\nyou were looking at was real.\n\n00:10:31.661 --> 00:10:33.478\nThat would surely make you say:\n\n00:10:33.502 --> 00:10:35.556\n[WTF?]\n\n00:10:35.580 --> 00:10:37.867\nOf course that's not how we buy stock.\n\n00:10:38.862 --> 00:10:41.881\nBut what if that's not how\nwe need to buy sneakers either?\n\n00:10:42.881 --> 00:10:44.263\nWhat if the inverse is true,\n\n00:10:44.287 --> 00:10:45.873\nand what if we could buy sneakers\n\n00:10:45.897 --> 00:10:47.690\nexactly the same way as we buy stock?\n\n00:10:47.714 --> 00:10:50.603\nAnd what if it wasn't just sneakers,\nbut any similar product,\n\n00:10:50.627 --> 00:10:52.730\nlike watches and handbags\nand women's shoes,\n\n00:10:52.754 --> 00:10:56.102\nand any collectible, any seasonal item\nand any markdown item?\n\n00:10:56.126 --> 00:10:59.369\nWhat if there was\na stock market for commerce?\n\n00:11:00.004 --> 00:11:02.826\nA stock market of things.\n\n00:11:04.125 --> 00:11:08.448\nAnd not only could you buy in a much more\neducated and efficient manner,\n\n00:11:08.472 --> 00:11:11.712\nbut you could engage in all\nthe sophisticated financial transactions\n\n00:11:11.736 --> 00:11:13.319\nyou can with the stock market.\n\n00:11:13.343 --> 00:11:14.946\nShorts and options and futures\n\n00:11:14.970 --> 00:11:18.080\nand well, maybe you see\nwhere this is going.\n\n00:11:18.104 --> 00:11:22.027\nMaybe you want to invest\nin a stock market of things.\n\n00:11:22.955 --> 00:11:29.227\nBecause if you had invested in a pair\nof Air Jordan 3 Black Cement in 2011,\n\n00:11:29.251 -->

Virtual reality", "duration": "567", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/nonny_de_la_pena_the_future_of_news_virtual_reality", "transcript": "What if I could present you a story that you would remember with your entire body and not just with your mind? My whole life as a journalist, I've really been compelled to try to make stories that can make a difference and maybe inspire people to care. I've worked in print. I've worked in documentary. I've worked in broadcast. But it really wasn't until I got involved with virtual reality that I started seeing these really intense, authentic reactions from people that really blew my mind.So the deal is that with VR, virtual reality, I can put you on scene in the middle of the story. By putting on these goggles that track wherever you look, you get this whole-body sensation, like you're actually, like, there. So five years ago was about when I really began to push the envelope with using virtual reality and journalism together. And I wanted to do a piece about hunger. Families in America are going hungry, food banks are overwhelmed, and they're often running out of food. Now, I knew I couldn't make people feel hungry, but maybe I could figure out a way to get them to feel something physical.So \u2014 again, this is five years ago \u2014 so doing journalism and virtual reality together was considered a worse-than-half-baked idea, and I had no funding. Believe me, I had a lot of colleagues laughing at me. And I did, though, have a really great intern, a woman named Michaela Kobsa-Mark. And together we went out to food banks and started recording audio and photographs. Until one day she came back to my office and she was bawling, she was just crying. She had been on scene at a long line, where the woman running the line was feeling extremely overwhelmed, and she was screaming, \"There's too many people! There's too many people!\" And this man with diabetes doesn't get food in time, his blood sugar drops too low, and he collapses into a coma. As soon as I heard that audio, I knew that this would be the kind of evocative piece that could really describe what was going on at food banks.So here's the real line. You can see how long it was, right? And again, as I said, we didn't have very much funding, so I had to reproduce it with virtual humans that were donated, and people begged and borrowed favors to help me create the models and make things as accurate as we could. And then we tried to convey what happened that day with as much as accuracy as is possible.(Video) Voice: There's too many people! There's too many people!Voice: OK, he's having a seizure.Voice: We need an ambulance.Nonny de la Pe\u00f1a: So the man on the right, for him, he's walking around the body. For him, he's in the room with that body. Like, that guy is at his feet. And even though, through his peripheral vision, he can see that he's in this lab space, he should be able to see that he's not actually on the street, but he feels like he's there with those people. He's very cautious not to step on this guy who isn't really there, right?So that piece ended up going to Sundance in 2012, a kind of amazing thing, and it was the first virtual reality film ever, basically. And when we went, I was really terrified. I didn't really know how people were going to react and what was going to happen. And we showed up with this duct-taped pair of goggles.(Video) Oh, you're crying. You're crying. Gina, you're crying.So you can hear the surprise in my voice, right? And this kind of reaction ended up being the kind of reaction we saw over and over and over: people down on the ground trying to comfort the seizure victim, trying to whisper something into his ear or in some way help, even though they couldn't. And I had a lot of people come out of that piece saying, \"Oh my God, I was so frustrated. I couldn't help the guy,\" and take that back into their lives.So after this piece was made, the dean of the cinema school at USC, the University of Southern California, brought in the head of the World Economic Forum to try \"Hunger,\" and he took off the goggles, and he commissioned a piece about Syria on the spot. And I really wanted to do something about Syrian refugee kids, because children have been the worst affected by the Syrian civil war. I sent a team to the border of Iraq to record material at refugee camps, basically an area I wouldn't send a team now, as that's where ISIS is really operating. And then we also recreated a street scene in which a young girl is singing and a bomb goes off. Now, when you're in the middle of that scene and you hear those sounds, and you see the injured around you, it's an incredibly scary and real feeling. I've had individuals who have been involved in real bombings tell me that it evokes the same kind of fear.[The civil war in Syria may seem far away] [until you experience it yourself.](Girl singing)(Explosion)[Project Syria] [A virtual reality experience]NP: We were then invited to take the piece to the Victoria and Albert Museum in London. And it wasn't advertised. And we were put in this tapestry room. There was no press about it, so anybody who happened to walk into the museum to visit it that day would see us with these crazy lights. You know, maybe they would want to see the old storytelling of the tapestries. They were confronted by our virtual reality cameras. But a lot of people tried it, and over a five-day run we ended up with 54 pages of guest book comments, and we were told by the curators there that they'd never seen such an outpouring. Things like, \"It's so real,\" \"Absolutely believable,\" or, of course, the one that I was excited about, \"A real feeling as if you were in the middle of something that you normally see on the TV news.\"So, it works, right? This stuff works. And it doesn't really matter where you're from or what age you are \u2014 it's really evocative.Now, don't get me wrong \u2014 I'm not saying that when you're in a piece you forget that you're here. But it turns out we can feel like we're in two places at once. We can have what I call this duality of presence, and I think that's what allows me to tap into these feelings of empathy. Right?So that means, of course, that I have to be very cautious about creating these pieces. I have to really follow best journalistic practices and make sure that these powerful stories are built with integrity. If we don't capture the material ourselves, we have to be extremely exacting about figuring out the provenance and where did this stuff come from and is it authentic?Let me give you an example. With this Trayvon Martin case, this is a guy, a kid, who was 17 years old and he bought soda and a candy at a store, and on his way home he was tracked by a neighborhood watchman named George Zimmerman who ended up shooting and killing him. To make that piece, we got the architectural drawings of the entire complex, and we rebuilt the entire scene inside and out, based on those drawings. All of the action is informed by the real 911 recorded calls to the police. And interestingly, we broke some news with this story. The forensic house that did the audio reconstruction, Primeau Productions, they say that they would testify that George Zimmerman, when he got out of the car, he cocked his gun before he went to give chase to Martin.So you can see that the basic tenets of journalism, they don't really change here, right? We're still following the same principles that we would always. What is different is the sense of being on scene, whether you're watching a guy collapse from hunger or feeling like you're in the middle of a bomb scene. And this is kind of what has driven me forward with these pieces, and thinking about how to make them. We're trying to make this, obviously, beyond the headset, more available. We're creating mobile pieces like the Trayvon Martin piece. And these things have had impact. I've had Americans tell me that they've donated, direct deductions from their bank account, money to go to Syrian children refugees. And \"Hunger in LA,\" well, it's helped start a new form of doing journalism that I think is going to join all the other normal platforms in the future.Thank you.(Applause)", "id": 2376, "subtitle":

It's three dots there on the globe. Those dots are pretty huge. I think each one is about the size of California. Tell us about Kiribati.Anote Tong: Well, let me first begin by saying how deeply grateful I am for this opportunity to share my story with people who do care. I think I've been sharing my story with a lot of people who don't care too much. But Kiribati is comprised of three groups of islands: the Gilbert Group on the west, we have the Phoenix Islands in the middle, and the Line Islands in the east. And quite frankly, Kiribati is perhaps the only country that is actually in the four corners of the world, because we are in the Northern Hemisphere, in the Southern Hemisphere, and also in the east and the west of the International Date Line. These islands are entirely made up of coral atolls, and on average about two meters above sea level. And so this is what we have. Usually not more than two kilometers in width. And so, on many occasions, I've been asked by people, \"You know, you're suffering, why don't you move back?\" They don't understand. They have no concept of what it is that's involved. With the rising sea, they say, \"Well, you can move back.\" And so this is what I tell them. If we move back, we will fall off on the other side of the ocean. OK? But these are the kinds of issues that people don't understand.CA: So certainly this is just a picture of fragility there. When was it that you yourself realized that there might be impending peril for your country?AT: Well, the story of climate change has been one that has been going on for quite a number of decades. And when I came into office in 2003, I began talking about climate change at the United Nations General Assembly, but not with so much passion, because then there was still this controversy among the scientists whether it was human-induced, whether it was real or it wasn't. But I think that that debate was fairly much concluded in 2007 with the Fourth Assessment Report of the IPCC, which made a categorical statement that it is real, it's human-induced, and it's predicting some very serious scenarios for countries like mine. And so that's when I got very serious. In the past, I talked about it. We were worried. But when the scenarios, the predictions came in 2007, it became a real issue for us.CA: Now, those predictions are, I think, that by 2100, sea levels are forecast to rise perhaps three feet. There's scenarios where it's higher than that, for sure, but what would you say to a skeptic who said, \"What's three feet? You're on average six feet above sea level. What's the problem?\"AT: Well, I think it's got to be understood that a marginal rise in sea level would mean a loss of a lot of land, because much of the land is low. And quite apart from that, we are getting the swells at the moment. So it's not about getting two feet. I think what many people do not understand is they think climate change is something that is happening in the future. Well, we're at the very bottom end of the spectrum. It's already with us. We have communities who already have been dislocated. They have had to move, and every parliament session, I'm getting complaints from different communities asking for assistance to build seawalls, to see what we can do about the freshwater lens because it's being destroyed, and so in my trips to the different islands, I'm seeing evidence of communities which are now having to cope with the loss of food crops, the contamination of the water lenses, and I see these communities perhaps leaving, having to relocate, within five to 10 years.CA: And then, I think the country suffered its first cyclone, and this is connected, yes? What happened here?AT: Well, we're on the equator, and I'm sure many of you understand that when you're on the equator, it's supposed to be in the doldrums. We're not supposed to get the cyclones. We create them, and then we send them either north or south.(Laughter)But they aren't supposed to come back. But for the first time, at the beginning of this year, the Cyclone Pam, which destroyed Vanuatu, and in the process, the very edges of it actually touched our two southernmost islands, and all of Tuvalu was underwater when Hurricane Pam struck. But for our two southernmost islands, we had waves come over half the island, and so this has never happened before. It's a new experience. And I've just come back from my own constituency, and I've seen these beautiful trees which had been there for decades, they've been totally destroyed. So this is what's happening, but when we talk about the rising sea level, we think it's something that happens gradually. It comes with the winds, it comes with the swells, and so they can be magnified, but what we are beginning to witness is the change in the weather pattern, which is perhaps the more urgent challenge that we will face sooner than perhaps the rising sea level.CA: So the country is already seeing effects now. As you look forward, what are your options as a country, as a nation?AT: Well, I've been telling this story every year. I think I visit a number of \u2014 I've been traveling the world to try and get people to understand. We have a plan, we think we have a plan. And on one occasion, I think I spoke in Geneva and there was a gentleman who was interviewing me on something like this, and I said, \"We are looking at floating islands,\" and he thought it was funny, but somebody said, \"No, this is not funny. These people are looking for solutions.\" And so I have been looking at floating islands. The Japanese are interested in building floating islands.But, as a country, we have made a commitment that no matter what happens, we will try as much as possible to stay and continue to exist as a nation. What that will take, it's going to be something quite significant, very, very substantial. Either we live on floating islands, or we have to build up the islands to continue to stay out of the water as the sea level rises and as the storms get more severe. But even that, it's going to be very, very difficult to get the kind of resourcing that we would need.CA: And then the only recourse is some form of forced migration.AT: Well, we are also looking at that because in the event that nothing comes forward from the international community, we are preparing, we don't want to be caught like what's happening in Europe. OK? We don't want to mass migrate at some point in time. We want to be able to give the people the choice today, those who choose and want to do that, to migrate. We don't want something to happen that they are forced to migrate without having been prepared to do so. Of course, our culture is very different, our society is very different, and once we migrate into a different environment, a different culture, there's a whole lot of adjustments that are required.CA: Well, there's forced migration in your country's past, and I think just this week, just yesterday or the day before yesterday, you visited these people. What happened here? What's the story here?AT: Yes, and I'm sorry, I think somebody was asking why we were sneaking off to visit that place. I had a very good reason, because we have a community of Kiribati people living in that part of the Solomon Islands, but these were people who were relocated from the Phoenix Islands, in fact, in the 1960s. There was serious drought, and the people could not continue to live on the island, and so they were moved to live here in the Solomon Islands. And so yesterday it was very interesting to meet with these people. They didn't know who I was. They hadn't heard of me. Some of them later recognized me, but I think they were very happy. Later they really wanted to have the opportunity to welcome me formally. But I think what I saw yesterday was very interesting because here I see our people. I spoke in our language, and of course they spoke back, they replied, but their accent, they are beginning not to be able to speak Kiribati properly. I saw them, there was this lady with red teeth. She was chewing betel nuts, and it's not something we do in Kiribati. We don't chew betel nuts. I met also a family who have married the local people here, and so this is what is happening. As you go into another community, there are bound to be changes. There is bound to be a certain loss of identity, and this is what we will be looking for in the future if and when we do migrate.CA: It must have been just an extraordinarily emotional day because of these questions about identity, the joy of seeing you and perhaps an emphasized sense of what they had lost. And it's very inspiring to hear you say you're going to fight to the end to try to preserve the nation in a location.AT: This is our wish. Nobody wants ever to leave their home, and so it's been a very difficult decision for me. As a leader, you don't make plans to leave your island, your home, and so I've been asked on a number of occasions, \"So how do you feel?\" And it doesn't feel good at all. It's an emotional thing, and I've tried to live with it, and I know that on occasions, I'm accused of not trying to solve the problem because I can't solve the problem. It's something that's got to be done collectively.Climate change is a global phenomenon, and as I've often argued, unfortunately, the countries, when we come to the United Nations \u2014 I was in a meeting with the Pacific Island Forum countries where Australia and New Zealand are also members, and we had an argument. There was a bit of a story in the news because they were arguing that to cut emissions, it would be something that they're unable to do because it would affect the industries. And so here I was saying, OK, I hear you, I understand what you're saying, but try also to understand what I'm saying because if you do not cut your emissions, then our survival is on the line. And so it's a matter for you to weigh this, these moral issues. It's about industry as opposed to the survival of a people.CA: You know, I ask you yesterday what made you angry, and you said, \"I don't get angry.\" But then you paused. I think this made you angry.AT: I'd refer you to my earlier statement at the United Nations. I was very angry, very frustrated and then depressed. There was a sense of futility that we are fighting a fight that we have no hope of winning. I had to change my approach. I had to become more reasonable because I thought people would listen to somebody who was rational, but I remain radically rational, whatever that is.(Laughter)CA: Now, a core part of your nation's identity is fishing. I think you said pretty much everyone is involved in fishing in some way.AT: Well, we eat fish every day, every day, and I think there is no doubt that our rate of consumption of fish is perhaps the highest in the world. We don't have a lot of livestock, so it's fish that we depend on.CA: So you're dependent on fish, both at the local level and for the revenues that the country receives from the global fishing business for tuna, and yet despite that, a few years ago you took a very radical step. Can you tell us about that? I think something happened right here in the Phoenix Islands.AT: Let me give some of the background of what fish means for us. We have one of the largest tuna fisheries remaining in the world. In the Pacific, I think we own something like 60 percent of the remaining tuna fisheries, and it remains relatively healthy for some species, but not all. And Kiribati is one of the three major resource owners, tuna resource owners. And at the moment, we have been getting something like 80 to 90 percent of our revenue from access fees, license fees.CA: Of your national revenue.AT: National revenue, which drives everything that we do in governments, hospitals, schools and what have you. But we decided to close this, and it was a very difficult decision. I can assure you, politically, locally, it was not easy, but I was convinced that we had to do this in order to ensure that the fishery remains sustainable. There had been some indications that some of the species, in particular the bigeye, was under serious threat. The yellowfin was also heavily fished. Skipjack remains healthy. And so we had to do something like that, and so that was the reason I did that. Another reason why I did that was because I had been asking the international community that in order to deal with climate change, in order to fight climate change, there has got to be sacrifice, there has got to be commitment. So in asking the international community to make a sacrifice, I thought we ourselves need to make that sacrifice. And so we made the sacrifice. And forgoing commercial fishing in the Phoenix Islands protected area would mean a loss of revenue. We are still trying to assess what that loss would be because we actually closed it off at the beginning of this year, and so we will see by the end of this year what it means in terms of the lost revenue.CA: So there's so many things playing into this. On the one hand, it may prompt healthier fisheries. I mean, how much are you able to move the price up that you charge for the remaining areas?AT: The negotiations have been very difficult, but we have managed to raise the cost of a vessel day. For any vessel to come in to fish for a day, we have raised the fee from \u2014 it was $6,000 and $8,000, now to $10,000, $12,000 per vessel day. And so there's been that significant increase. But at the same time, what's important to note is, whereas in the past these fishing boats might be fishing in a day and maybe catch 10 tons, now they're catching maybe 100 tons because they've become so efficient. And so we've got to respond likewise. We've got to be very, very careful because the technology has so improved. There was a time when the Brazilian fleet moved from the Atlantic to the Pacific. They couldn't. They started experimenting if they could, per se. But now they've got ways of doing it, and they've become so efficient.CA: Can you give us a sense of what it's like in those negotiations? Because you're up against companies that have hundreds of millions of dollars at stake, essentially. How do you hold the line? Is there any advice you can give to other leaders who are dealing with the same companies about how to get the most for your country, get the most for the fish? What advice would you give?AT: Well, I think we focus too often on licensing in order to get the rate of return, because what we are getting from license fees is about 10 percent of the landed value of the catch on the side of the wharf, not in the retail shops. And we only get about 10 percent. What we have been trying to do over the years is actually to increase our participation in the industry, in the harvesting, in the processing, and eventually, hopefully, the marketing. They're not easy to penetrate, but we are working towards that, and yes, the answer would be to enhance. In order to increase our rate of return, we have to become more involved. And so we've started doing that, and we have to restructure the industry. We've got to tell these people that the world has changed. Now we want to produce the fish ourselves.CA: And meanwhile, for your local fishermen, they are still able to fish, but what is business like for them? Is it getting harder? Are the waters depleted? Or is that being run on a sustainable basis?AT: For the artisanal fishery, we do not participate in the commercial fishing activity except only to supply the domestic market. The tuna fishery is really entirely for the foreign market, mostly here in the US, Europe, Japan. So I am a fisherman, very much, and I used to be able to catch yellowfin. Now it's very, very rare to be able to catch yellowfin because they are being lifted out of the water by the hundreds of tons by these purse seiners.CA: So here's a couple of beautiful girls from your country. I mean, as you think about their future, what message would you have for them and what message would you have for the world?AT: Well, I've been telling the world that we really have to do something about what is happening to the climate because for us, it's about the future of these children. I have 12 grandchildren, at least. I think I have 12, my wife knows.(Laughter)And I think I have eight children. It's about their future. Every day I see my grandchildren, about the same age as these young girls, and I do wonder, and I get angry sometimes, yes I do. I wonder what is to become of them. And so it's about them that we should be telling everybody, that it's not about their own national interest, because climate change, regrettably, unfortunately, is viewed by many countries as a national problem. It's not. And this is the argument we got into recently with our partners, the Australians and New Zealanders, because they said, \"We can't cut any more.\" This is what one of the leaders, the Australian leader, said, that we've done our part, we are cutting back. I said, What about the rest? Why don't you keep it? If you could keep the rest of your emissions within your boundaries, within your borders, we'd have no question. You can go ahead as much as you like. But unfortunately, you're sending it our way, and it's affecting the future of our children. And so surely I think that is the heart of the problem of climate change today.We will be meeting in Paris at the end of this year, but until we can think of this as a global phenomenon, because we create it, individually, as nations, but it affects everybody else, and yet, we refuse to do anything about it, and we deal with it as a national problem, which it is not \u2014 it is a global issue, and it's got to be dealt with collectively.CA: People are incredibly bad at responding to graphs and numbers, and we shut our minds to it. Somehow, to people, we're slightly better at responding to that sometimes. And it seems like it's very possible that your nation, despite, actually because of the intense problems you face, you may yet be the warning light to the world that shines most visibly, most powerfully. I just want to thank you,  I'm sure, on behalf of all of us, for your extraordinary leadership and for being here.Mr. President, thank you so much.AT: Thank you.(Applause)", "id": 2379, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:12.718 --> 00:00:16.374\nChris Anderson: Perhaps we could start\nby just telling us about your country.\n\n00:00:16.398 --> 00:00:20.254\nIt's three dots there on the globe.\nThose dots are pretty huge.\n\n00:00:20.278 --> 00:00:22.934\nI think each one\nis about the size of California.\n\n00:00:22.958 --> 00:00:24.814\nTell us about Kiribati.\n\n00:00:24.838 --> 00:00:29.334\nAnote Tong: Well, let me first begin\nby saying how deeply grateful I am\n\n00:00:29.358 --> 00:00:33.494\nfor this opportunity to share my story\nwith people who do care.\n\n00:00:33.518 --> 00:00:39.094\nI think I've been sharing my story with\na lot of people who don't care too much.\n\n00:00:39.118 --> 00:00:42.974\nBut Kiribati is comprised\nof three groups of islands:\n\n00:00:42.998 --> 00:00:45.814\nthe Gilbert Group on the west,\n\n00:00:45.838 --> 00:00:49.174\nwe have the Phoenix Islands in the middle,\n\n00:00:49.198 --> 00:00:53.614\nand the Line Islands in the east.\n\n00:00:53.638 --> 00:00:56.734\nAnd quite frankly, Kiribati\nis perhaps the only country\n\n00:00:56.758 --> 00:00:59.099\nthat is actually\nin the four corners of the world,\n\n00:00:59.124 --> 00:01:02.423\nbecause we are in the Northern Hemisphere,\nin the Southern Hemisphere,\n\n00:01:02.448 --> 00:01:05.503\nand also in the east and the west\nof the International Date Line.\n\n00:01:05.528 --> 00:01:11.854\nThese islands are entirely\nmade up of coral atolls,\n\n00:01:11.878 --> 00:01:16.813\nand on average about\ntwo meters above sea level.\n\n00:01:16.837 --> 00:01:20.294\nAnd so this is what we have.\n\n00:01:20.318 --> 00:01:25.134\nUsually not more\nthan two kilometers in width.\n\n00:01:25.158 --> 00:01:28.094\nAnd so, on many occasions,\nI've been asked by people,\n\n00:01:28.118 --> 00:01:30.654\n\"You know, you're suffering,\nwhy don't you move back?\"\n\n00:01:30.678 --> 00:01:31.894\nThey don't understand.\n\n00:01:31.918 --> 00:01:35.614\nThey have no concept\nof what it is that's involved.\n\n00:01:35.638 --> 00:01:39.214\nWith the rising sea, they say,\n\"Well, you can move back.\"\n\n00:01:39.238 --> 00:01:40.814\nAnd so this is what I tell them.\n\n00:01:40.838 --> 00:01:45.174\nIf we move back, we will fall off\non the other side of the ocean. OK?\n\n00:01:45.198 --> 00:01:49.974\nBut these are the kinds of issues\nthat people don't understand.\n\n00:01:49.998 --> 00:01:54.214\nCA: So certainly this is\njust a picture of fragility there.\n\n00:01:54.238 --> 00:01:56.774\nWhen was it that you yourself realized\n\n00:01:56.798 --> 00:02:00.414\nthat there might be\nimpending peril for your country?\n\n00:02:00.438 --> 00:02:03.894\nAT: Well, the story of climate change\nhas been one that has been going on\n\n00:02:03.918 --> 00:02:05.374\nfor quite a number of decades.\n\n00:02:05.398 --> 00:02:10.134\nAnd when I came into office in 2003,\n\n00:02:10.158 --> 00:02:14.414\nI began talking about climate change\nat the United Nations General Assembly,\n\n00:02:14.438 --> 00:02:17.174\nbut not with so much passion,\n\n00:02:17.198 --> 00:02:20.814\nbecause then there was still\nthis controversy among the scientists\n\n00:02:20.838 --> 00:02:26.094\nwhether it was human-induced,\nwhether it was real or it wasn't.\n\n00:02:26.118 --> 00:02:32.254\nBut I think that that debate\nwas fairly much concluded in 2007\n\n00:02:32.278 --> 00:02:37.854\nwith the Fourth Assessment\nReport of the IPCC,\n\n00:02:37.878 --> 00:02:44.734\nwhich made a categorical statement\nthat it is real, it's human-induced,\n\n00:02:44.758 --> 00:02:48.694\nand it's predicting\nsome very serious scenarios\n\n00:02:48.718 --> 00:02:51.254\nfor countries like mine.\n\n00:02:51.278 --> 00:02:54.534\nAnd so that's when I got very serious.\n\n00:02:54.558 --> 00:02:58.534\nIn the past, I talked about it.\n\n00:02:58.558 --> 00:02:59.774\nWe were worried.\n\n00:02:59.798 --> 00:03:03.534\nBut when the scenarios,\nthe predictions came in 2007,\n\n00:03:03.558 --> 00:03:05.894\nit became a real issue for us.\n\n00:03:05.918 --> 00:03:11.534\nCA: Now, those predictions are,\nI think, that by 2100,\n\n00:03:11.558 --> 00:03:14.334\nsea levels are forecast to rise\nperhaps three feet.\n\n00:03:14.358 --> 00:03:16.978\nThere's scenarios where\nit's higher than that, for sure,\n\n00:03:17.002 --> 00:03:19.138\nbut what would you say\nto a skeptic who said,\n\n00:03:19.162 --> 00:03:20.334\n\"What's three feet?\n\n00:03:20.358 --> 00:03:22.534\nYou're on average\nsix feet above sea level.\n\n00:03:22.558 --> 00:03:24.134\nWhat's the problem?\"\n\n00:03:24.158 --> 00:03:26.214\nAT: Well, I think\nit's got to be understood\n\n00:03:26.238 --> 00:03:28.294\nthat a marginal rise in sea level\n\n00:03:28.318 --> 00:03:30.894\nwould mean a loss of a lot of land,\n\n00:03:30.918 --> 00:03:34.174\nbecause much of the land is low.\n\n00:03:34.198 --> 00:03:39.294\nAnd quite apart from that,\nwe are getting the swells at the moment.\n\n00:03:39.318 --> 00:03:41.494\nSo it's not about getting two feet.\n\n00:03:41.518 --> 00:03:44.534\nI think what many people do not understand\n\n00:03:44.558 --> 00:03:50.734\nis they think climate change is something\nthat is happening in the future.\n\n00:03:50.758 --> 00:03:53.574\nWell, we're at the very\nbottom end of the spectrum.\n\n00:03:53.598 --> 00:03:54.854\nIt's already with us.\n\n00:03:54.878 --> 00:03:58.694\nWe have communities\nwho already have been dislocated.\n\n00:03:58.718 --> 00:04:02.654\nThey have had to move,\nand every parliament session,\n\n00:04:02.678 --> 00:04:05.014\nI'm getting complaints\nfrom different communities\n\n00:04:05.038 --> 00:04:08.094\nasking for assistance to build seawalls,\n\n00:04:08.118 --> 00:04:10.654\nto see what we can do\nabout the freshwater lens\n\n00:04:10.678 --> 00:04:12.494\nbecause it's being destroyed,\n\n00:04:12.518 --> 00:04:15.254\nand so in my trips\nto the different islands,\n\n00:04:15.278 --> 00:04:17.974\nI'm seeing evidence of communities\n\n00:04:17.998 --> 00:04:21.614\nwhich are now having to cope\nwith the loss of food crops,\n\n00:04:21.638 --> 00:04:25.214\nthe contamination of the water lenses,\n\n00:04:25.238 --> 00:04:29.574\nand I see these communities\nperhaps leaving, having to relocate,\n\n00:04:29.598 --> 00:04:31.934\nwithin five to 10 years.\n\n00:04:31.958 --> 00:04:35.894\nCA: And then, I think the country\nsuffered its first cyclone,\n\n00:04:35.918 --> 00:04:39.454\nand this is connected, yes?\nWhat happened here?\n\n00:04:39.478 --> 00:04:42.174\nAT: Well, we're on the equator,\n\n00:04:42.198 --> 00:04:46.614\nand I'm sure many of you understand\nthat when you're on the equator,\n\n00:04:46.638 --> 00:04:50.214\nit's supposed to be in the doldrums.\nWe're not supposed to get the cyclones.\n\n00:04:50.238 --> 00:04:53.048\nWe create them, and then we send them\neither north or south.\n\n00:04:53.072 --> 00:04:54.454\n(Laughter)\n\n00:04:54.478 --> 00:04:56.334\nBut they aren't supposed to come back.\n\n00:04:56.358 --> 00:04:58.882\nBut for the first time,\nat the beginning of this year,\n\n00:04:58.906 --> 00:05:02.574\nthe Cyclone Pam,\nwhich destroyed Vanuatu,\n\n00:05:02.598 --> 00:05:06.054\nand in the process,\nthe very edges of it actually touched\n\n00:05:06.078 --> 00:05:08.454\nour two southernmost islands,\n\n00:05:08.478 --> 00:05:13.854\nand all of Tuvalu was underwater\nwhen Hurricane Pam struck.\n\n00:05:13.878 --> 00:05:17.574\nBut for our two southernmost islands,\n\n00:05:17.598 --> 00:05:20.934\nwe had waves come over half the island,\n\n00:05:20.958 --> 00:05:23.414\nand so this has never happened before.\n\n00:05:23.438 --> 00:05:25.014\nIt's a new experience.\n\n00:05:25.038 --> 00:05:30.374\nAnd I've just come back\nfrom my own constituency,\n\n00:05:30.398 --> 00:05:33.734\nand I've seen these beautiful trees\nwhich had been there for decades,\n\n00:05:33.758 --> 00:05:35.734\nthey've been totally destroyed.\n\n00:05:35.758 --> 00:05:37.454\nSo this is what's happening,\n\n00:05:37.478 --> 00:05:41.334\nbut when we talk\nabout the rising sea level,\n\n00:05:41.358 --> 00:05:44.454\nwe think it's something\nthat happens gradually.\n\n00:05:44.478 --> 00:05:47.534\nIt comes with the winds,\nit comes with the swells,\n\n00:05:47.558 --> 00:05:49.494\nand so they can be magnified,\n\n00:05:49.518 --> 00:05:55.694\nbut what we are beginning to witness\nis the change in the weather pattern,\n\n00:05:55.718 --> 00:05:58.454\nwhich is perhaps the more urgent challenge\n\n00:05:58.478 --> 00:06:03.014\nthat we will face sooner\nthan perhaps the rising sea level.\n\n00:06:03.038 --> 00:06:06.294\nCA: So the country\nis already seeing effects now.\n\n00:06:06.318 --> 00:06:08.494\nAs you look forward,\n\n00:06:08.518 --> 00:06:12.454\nwhat are your options\nas a country, as a nation?\n\n00:06:12.478 --> 00:06:15.134\nAT: Well, I've been telling\nthis story every year.\n\n00:06:15.158 --> 00:06:16.587\nI think I visit a number of --\n\n00:06:16.611 --> 00:06:21.574\nI've been traveling the world\nto try and get people to understand.\n\n00:06:21.598 --> 00:06:24.054\nWe have a plan, we think we have a plan.\n\n00:06:24.078 --> 00:06:27.494\nAnd on one occasion,\nI think I spoke in Geneva\n\n00:06:27.518 --> 00:06:31.694\nand there was a gentleman\nwho was interviewing me\n\n00:06:31.718 --> 00:06:33.454\non something like this,\n\n00:06:33.478 --> 00:06:35.814\nand I said, \"We are looking\nat floating islands,\"\n\n00:06:35.838 --> 00:06:38.054\nand he thought it was funny,\nbut somebody said,\n\n00:06:38.078 --> 00:06:42.014\n\"No, this is not funny.\nThese people are looking for solutions.\"\n\n00:06:42.038 --> 00:06:45.574\nAnd so I have been looking\nat floating islands.\n\n00:06:45.598 --> 00:06:49.334\nThe Japanese are interested\nin building floating islands.\n\n00:06:49.358 --> 00:06:52.294\nBut, as a country,\nwe have made a commitment\n\n00:06:52.318 --> 00:06:56.014\nthat no matter what happens,\nwe will try as much as possible\n\n00:06:56.038 --> 00:07:00.214\nto stay and continue to exist as a nation.\n\n00:07:00.238 --> 00:07:01.774\nWhat that will take,\n\n00:07:01.798 --> 00:07:05.214\nit's going to be\nsomething quite significant,\n\n00:07:05.238 --> 00:07:07.254\nvery, very substantial.\n\n00:07:07.278 --> 00:07:09.054\nEither we live on floating islands,\n\n00:07:09.078 --> 00:07:13.054\nor we have to build up the islands\nto continue to stay out of the water\n\n00:07:13.078 --> 00:07:17.814\nas the sea level rises\nand as the storms get more severe.\n\n00:07:17.838 --> 00:07:20.267\nBut even that, it's going to be\nvery, very difficult\n\n00:07:20.291 --> 00:07:23.134\nto get the kind of resourcing\nthat we would need.\n\n00:07:23.158 --> 00:07:27.014\nCA: And then the only recourse\nis some form of forced migration.\n\n00:07:27.038 --> 00:07:29.254\nAT: Well, we are also looking at that\n\n00:07:29.278 --> 00:07:32.174\nbecause in the event\nthat nothing comes forward\n\n00:07:32.198 --> 00:07:34.014\nfrom the international community,\n\n00:07:34.038 --> 00:07:35.294\nwe are preparing,\n\n00:07:35.318 --> 00:07:38.534\nwe don't want to be caught\nlike what's happening in Europe.\n\n00:07:38.558 --> 00:07:41.254\nOK? We don't want to mass migrate\nat some point in time.\n\n00:07:41.278 --> 00:07:44.694\nWe want to be able\nto give the people the choice today,\n\n00:07:44.718 --> 00:07:48.374\nthose who choose\nand want to do that, to migrate.\n\n00:07:48.398 --> 00:07:53.454\nWe don't want something to happen\nthat they are forced to migrate\n\n00:07:53.478 --> 00:07:55.774\nwithout having been prepared to do so.\n\n00:07:55.798 --> 00:07:59.294\nOf course, our culture is very different,\nour society is very different,\n\n00:07:59.318 --> 00:08:01.654\nand once we migrate\ninto a different environment,\n\n00:08:01.678 --> 00:08:02.894\na different culture,\n\n00:08:02.918 --> 00:08:05.854\nthere's a whole lot\nof adjustments that are required.\n\n00:08:05.878 --> 00:08:09.134\nCA: Well, there's forced migration\nin your country's past,\n\n00:08:09.158 --> 00:08:10.814\nand I think just this week,\n\n00:08:10.838 --> 00:08:14.094\njust yesterday\nor the day before yesterday,\n\n00:08:14.118 --> 00:08:16.294\nyou visited these people.\n\n00:08:16.318 --> 00:08:18.494\nWhat happened here? What's the story here?\n\n00:08:18.518 --> 00:08:20.934\nAT: Yes, and I'm sorry,\nI think somebody was asking\n\n00:08:20.958 --> 00:08:23.934\nwhy we were sneaking off\nto visit that place.\n\n00:08:23.958 --> 00:08:27.934\nI had a very good reason, because we have\na community of Kiribati people\n\n00:08:27.958 --> 00:08:32.054\nliving in that part\nof the Solomon Islands,\n\n00:08:32.078 --> 00:08:35.934\nbut these were people who were relocated\nfrom the Phoenix Islands, in fact,\n\n00:08:35.958 --> 00:08:37.414\nin the 1960s.\n\n00:08:37.438 --> 00:08:41.974\nThere was serious drought, and the people\ncould not continue to live on the island,\n\n00:08:41.998 --> 00:08:45.374\nand so they were moved\nto live here in the Solomon Islands.\n\n00:08:45.398 --> 00:08:48.574\nAnd so yesterday it was very interesting\nto meet with these people.\n\n00:08:48.598 --> 00:08:51.054\nThey didn't know who I was.\nThey hadn't heard of me.\n\n00:08:51.078 --> 00:08:53.654\nSome of them later recognized me,\n\n00:08:53.678 --> 00:08:57.254\nbut I think they were very happy.\n\n00:08:57.278 --> 00:09:01.694\nLater they really wanted to have\nthe opportunity to welcome me formally.\n\n00:09:01.718 --> 00:09:04.974\nBut I think what I saw yesterday\nwas very interesting\n\n00:09:04.998 --> 00:09:06.814\nbecause here I see our people.\n\n00:09:06.838 --> 00:09:12.654\nI spoke in our language, and of course\nthey spoke back, they replied,\n\n00:09:12.678 --> 00:09:17.374\nbut their accent, they are beginning\nnot to be able to speak Kiribati properly.\n\n00:09:17.398 --> 00:09:19.894\nI saw them, there was\nthis lady with red teeth.\n\n00:09:19.918 --> 00:09:22.134\nShe was chewing betel nuts,\n\n00:09:22.158 --> 00:09:24.414\nand it's not something we do in Kiribati.\n\n00:09:24.438 --> 00:09:27.054\nWe don't chew betel nuts.\n\n00:09:27.078 --> 00:09:32.934\nI met also a family who have married\nthe local people here,\n\n00:09:32.958 --> 00:09:37.054\nand so this is what is happening.\n\n00:09:37.078 --> 00:09:40.654\nAs you go into another community,\nthere are bound to be changes.\n\n00:09:40.678 --> 00:09:45.134\nThere is bound to be\na certain loss of identity,\n\n00:09:45.158 --> 00:09:48.614\nand this is what we will be\nlooking for in the future\n\n00:09:48.638 --> 00:09:50.894\nif and when we do migrate.\n\n00:09:50.918 --> 00:09:54.094\nCA: It must have been\njust an extraordinarily emotional day\n\n00:09:54.118 --> 00:09:56.934\nbecause of these questions about identity,\n\n00:09:56.958 --> 00:10:02.174\nthe joy of seeing you and perhaps\nan emphasized sense of what they had lost.\n\n00:10:02.198 --> 00:10:05.579\nAnd it's very inspiring to hear you say\nyou're going to fight to the end\n\n00:10:05.603 --> 00:10:10.014\nto try to preserve\nthe nation in a location.\n\n00:10:10.038 --> 00:10:11.334\nAT: This is our wish.\n\n00:10:11.358 --> 00:10:14.414\nNobody wants ever to leave their home,\n\n00:10:14.438 --> 00:10:17.494\nand so it's been\na very difficult decision for me.\n\n00:10:17.518 --> 00:10:22.894\nAs a leader, you don't make plans\nto leave your island, your home,\n\n00:10:22.918 --> 00:10:25.174\nand so I've been asked\non a number of occasions,\n\n00:10:25.198 --> 00:10:26.414\n\"So how do you feel?\"\n\n00:10:26.438 --> 00:10:29.574\nAnd it doesn't feel good at all.\n\n00:10:29.598 --> 00:10:33.174\nIt's an emotional thing,\nand I've tried to live with it,\n\n00:10:33.198 --> 00:10:38.134\nand I know that on occasions, I'm accused\nof not trying to solve the problem\n\n00:10:38.158 --> 00:10:40.134\nbecause I can't solve the problem.\n\n00:10:40.158 --> 00:10:42.974\nIt's something that's got\nto be done collectively.\n\n00:10:42.998 --> 00:10:48.774\nClimate change is a global phenomenon,\nand as I've often argued,\n\n00:10:48.798 --> 00:10:53.294\nunfortunately, the countries,\nwhen we come to the United Nations --\n\n00:10:53.318 --> 00:10:58.214\nI was in a meeting with\nthe Pacific Island Forum countries\n\n00:10:58.238 --> 00:11:00.734\nwhere Australia and New Zealand\nare also members,\n\n00:11:00.758 --> 00:11:02.494\nand we had an argument.\n\n00:11:02.518 --> 00:11:05.214\nThere was a bit of a story in the news\n\n00:11:05.238 --> 00:11:09.534\nbecause they were arguing\nthat to cut emissions,\n\n00:11:09.558 --> 00:11:11.814\nit would be something\nthat they're unable to do\n\n00:11:11.838 --> 00:11:15.054\nbecause it would affect the industries.\n\n00:11:15.078 --> 00:11:16.534\nAnd so here I was saying,\n\n00:11:16.558 --> 00:11:18.774\nOK, I hear you,\n\n00:11:18.798 --> 00:11:20.454\nI understand what you're saying,\n\n00:11:20.478 --> 00:11:22.734\nbut try also to understand what I'm saying\n\n00:11:22.758 --> 00:11:25.374\nbecause if you do not cut your emissions,\n\n00:11:25.398 --> 00:11:27.774\nthen our survival is on the line.\n\n00:11:27.798 --> 00:11:32.134\nAnd so it's a matter for you\nto weigh this, these moral issues.\n\n00:11:32.158 --> 00:11:36.174\nIt's about industry as opposed to\nthe survival of a people.\n\n00:11:36.198 --> 00:11:38.854\nCA: You know, I ask you yesterday\nwhat made you angry,\n\n00:11:38.878 --> 00:11:42.374\nand you said, \"I don't get angry.\"\nBut then you paused.\n\n00:11:42.398 --> 00:11:44.014\nI think this made you angry.\n\n00:11:44.038 --> 00:11:48.934\nAT: I'd refer you to my earlier\nstatement at the United Nations.\n\n00:11:48.958 --> 00:11:53.894\nI was very angry, very frustrated\nand then depressed.\n\n00:11:53.918 --> 00:11:55.894\nThere was a sense of futility\n\n00:11:55.918 --> 00:12:01.374\nthat we are fighting a fight\nthat we have no hope of winning.\n\n00:12:01.398 --> 00:12:03.574\nI had to change my approach.\n\n00:12:03.598 --> 00:12:05.694\nI had to become more reasonable\n\n00:12:05.718 --> 00:12:08.861\nbecause I thought people would listen\nto somebody who was rational,\n\n00:12:08.885 --> 00:12:11.454\nbut I remain radically rational,\nwhatever that is.\n\n00:12:11.478 --> 00:12:13.094\n(Laughter)\n\n00:12:13.118 --> 00:12:16.854\nCA: Now, a core part\nof your nation's identity is fishing.\n\n00:12:16.878 --> 00:12:20.374\nI think you said pretty much everyone\nis involved in fishing in some way.\n\n00:12:20.398 --> 00:12:23.174\nAT: Well, we eat fish\nevery day, every day,\n\n00:12:23.198 --> 00:12:27.734\nand I think there is no doubt\nthat our rate of consumption of fish\n\n00:12:27.758 --> 00:12:29.894\nis perhaps the highest in the world.\n\n00:12:29.918 --> 00:12:32.374\nWe don't have a lot of livestock,\n\n00:12:32.398 --> 00:12:35.174\nso it's fish that we depend on.\n\n00:12:35.198 --> 00:12:38.334\nCA: So you're dependent on fish,\nboth at the local level\n\n00:12:38.358 --> 00:12:41.054\nand for the revenues\nthat the country receives\n\n00:12:41.078 --> 00:12:43.654\nfrom the global fishing business for tuna,\n\n00:12:43.678 --> 00:12:48.574\nand yet despite that, a few years ago\nyou took a very radical step.\n\n00:12:48.598 --> 00:12:49.974\nCan you tell us about that?\n\n00:12:49.998 --> 00:12:53.334\nI think something happened\nright here in the Phoenix Islands.\n\n00:12:53.358 --> 00:12:58.654\nAT: Let me give some of the background\nof what fish means for us.\n\n00:12:58.678 --> 00:13:02.614\nWe have one of the largest\ntuna fisheries remaining in the world.\n\n00:13:02.638 --> 00:13:05.494\nIn the Pacific, I think we own\nsomething like 60 percent\n\n00:13:05.518 --> 00:13:07.414\nof the remaining tuna fisheries,\n\n00:13:07.438 --> 00:13:11.694\nand it remains relatively healthy\nfor some species, but not all.\n\n00:13:11.718 --> 00:13:16.838\nAnd Kiribati is one of the three\nmajor resource owners,\n\n00:13:17.878 --> 00:13:19.574\ntuna resource owners.\n\n00:13:19.598 --> 00:13:23.174\nAnd at the moment, we have been getting\n\n00:13:23.198 --> 00:13:26.094\nsomething like 80 to 90\npercent of our revenue\n\n00:13:26.118 --> 00:13:28.574\nfrom access fees, license fees.\n\n00:13:28.598 --> 00:13:30.454\nCA: Of your national revenue.\n\n00:13:30.478 --> 00:13:32.294\nAT: National revenue,\n\n00:13:32.318 --> 00:13:35.134\nwhich drives everything that we do\n\n00:13:35.158 --> 00:13:39.174\nin governments, hospitals,\nschools and what have you.\n\n00:13:39.198 --> 00:13:44.414\nBut we decided to close this,\nand it was a very difficult decision.\n\n00:13:44.438 --> 00:13:49.974\nI can assure you, politically,\nlocally, it was not easy,\n\n00:13:49.998 --> 00:13:53.934\nbut I was convinced that we had to do this\n\n00:13:53.958 --> 00:13:58.534\nin order to ensure\nthat the fishery remains sustainable.\n\n00:13:58.558 --> 00:14:01.334\nThere had been some indications\nthat some of the species,\n\n00:14:01.358 --> 00:14:05.494\nin particular the bigeye,\nwas under serious threat.\n\n00:14:05.518 --> 00:14:08.894\nThe yellowfin was also heavily fished.\n\n00:14:08.918 --> 00:14:10.654\nSkipjack remains healthy.\n\n00:14:10.678 --> 00:14:15.454\nAnd so we had to do something like that,\nand so that was the reason I did that.\n\n00:14:15.478 --> 00:14:19.374\nAnother reason why I did that\n\n00:14:19.398 --> 00:14:24.094\nwas because I had been asking\nthe international community\n\n00:14:24.118 --> 00:14:28.654\nthat in order to deal with climate change,\nin order to fight climate change,\n\n00:14:28.678 --> 00:14:32.574\nthere has got to be sacrifice,\nthere has got to be commitment.\n\n00:14:32.598 --> 00:14:37.894\nSo in asking the international community\nto make a sacrifice,\n\n00:14:37.918 --> 00:14:40.734\nI thought we ourselves\nneed to make that sacrifice.\n\n00:14:40.758 --> 00:14:42.574\nAnd so we made the sacrifice.\n\n00:14:42.598 --> 00:14:47.541\nAnd forgoing commercial fishing\n\n00:14:47.566 --> 00:14:50.174\nin the Phoenix Islands protected area\n\n00:14:50.198 --> 00:14:52.054\nwould mean a loss of revenue.\n\n00:14:52.078 --> 00:14:54.555\nWe are still trying to assess\nwhat that loss would be\n\n00:14:54.579 --> 00:14:59.814\nbecause we actually closed it off\nat the beginning of this year,\n\n00:14:59.838 --> 00:15:02.174\nand so we will see by the end of this year\n\n00:15:02.198 --> 00:15:05.694\nwhat it means in terms\nof the lost revenue.\n\n00:15:05.718 --> 00:15:07.974\nCA: So there's so many things\nplaying into this.\n\n00:15:07.998 --> 00:15:14.974\nOn the one hand,\nit may prompt healthier fisheries.\n\n00:15:14.998 --> 00:15:17.374\nI mean, how much are you able\nto move the price up\n\n00:15:17.398 --> 00:15:19.894\nthat you charge for the remaining areas?\n\n00:15:19.918 --> 00:15:24.534\nAT: The negotiations\nhave been very difficult,\n\n00:15:24.558 --> 00:15:28.414\nbut we have managed\nto raise the cost of a vessel day.\n\n00:15:28.438 --> 00:15:31.054\nFor any vessel\nto come in to fish for a day,\n\n00:15:31.078 --> 00:15:34.694\nwe have raised the fee from --\nit was $6,000 and $8,000,\n\n00:15:34.718 --> 00:15:39.294\nnow to $10,000, $12,000 per vessel day.\n\n00:15:39.318 --> 00:15:42.534\nAnd so there's been\nthat significant increase.\n\n00:15:42.558 --> 00:15:47.134\nBut at the same time,\nwhat's important to note is,\n\n00:15:47.158 --> 00:15:51.494\nwhereas in the past these fishing boats\n\n00:15:51.518 --> 00:15:55.454\nmight be fishing in a day\nand maybe catch 10 tons,\n\n00:15:55.478 --> 00:15:59.374\nnow they're catching maybe 100 tons\nbecause they've become so efficient.\n\n00:15:59.398 --> 00:16:01.734\nAnd so we've got to respond likewise.\n\n00:16:01.758 --> 00:16:05.934\nWe've got to be very, very careful\nbecause the technology has so improved.\n\n00:16:05.958 --> 00:16:11.374\nThere was a time when the Brazilian fleet\nmoved from the Atlantic to the Pacific.\n\n00:16:11.398 --> 00:16:12.614\nThey couldn't.\n\n00:16:12.638 --> 00:16:15.854\nThey started experimenting\nif they could, per se.\n\n00:16:15.878 --> 00:16:19.558\nBut now they've got ways of doing it,\nand they've become so efficient.\n\n00:16:20.958 --> 00:16:24.156\nCA: Can you give us a sense\nof what it's like in those negotiations?\n\n00:16:24.181 --> 00:16:25.878\nBecause you're up against companies\n\n00:16:25.902 --> 00:16:29.494\nthat have hundreds of millions\nof dollars at

00:16:47.934\nWhat advice would you give?\n\n00:16:47.958 --> 00:16:54.214\nAT: Well, I think we focus\ntoo often on licensing\n\n00:16:54.238 --> 00:16:55.905\nin order to get the rate of return,\n\n00:16:55.929 --> 00:16:58.734\nbecause what we are getting\nfrom license fees\n\n00:16:58.758 --> 00:17:01.374\nis about 10 percent\nof the landed value of the catch\n\n00:17:01.398 --> 00:17:04.534\non the side of the wharf,\nnot in the retail shops.\n\n00:17:04.558 --> 00:17:08.534\nAnd we only get about 10 percent.\n\n00:17:08.558 --> 00:17:11.174\nWhat we have been trying\nto do

involved.\n\n00:17:32.518 --> 00:17:35.694\nAnd so we've started doing that,\n\n00:17:35.718 --> 00:17:39.974\nand we have to restructure the industry.\n\n00:17:39.998 --> 00:17:43.374\nWe've got to

00:19:20.574\nAnd so it's about them\n\n00:19:20.598 --> 00:19:22.854\nthat we should be telling everybody,\n\n00:19:22.878 --> 00:19:25.134\nthat it's not about\ntheir own national interest,\n\n00:19:25.158 --> 00:19:28.814\nbecause climate change,\nregrettably, unfortunately,\n\n00:19:28.838 --> 00:19:32.934\nis viewed by many countries\nas a national problem. It's not.\n\n00:19:32.958 --> 00:19:35.958\nAnd this is the argument\nwe got into recently with our partners,\n\n00:19:35.982 --> 00:19:37.678\nthe Australians and New Zealanders,\n\n00:19:37.702 --> 00:19:41.014\nbecause they said,\n\"We can't cut any more.\"\n\n00:19:41.038 --> 00:19:44.654\nThis is what one of the leaders,\nthe Australian leader, said,\n\n00:19:44.678 --> 00:19:48.934\nthat we've done our part,\nwe are cutting back.\n\n00:19:48.958 --> 00:19:52.614\nI said, What about the rest?\nWhy don't you keep it?\n\n00:19:52.638 --> 00:19:55.334\nIf you could keep\nthe rest of your emissions\n\n00:19:55.358 --> 00:19:57.654\nwithin your boundaries,\nwithin your borders,\n\n00:19:57.678 --> 00:19:59.454\nwe'd have no question.\n\n00:19:59.478 --> 00:20:01.294\nYou can go ahead as much as you like.\n\n00:20:01.318 --> 00:20:03.454\nBut unfortunately,\nyou're sending it our way,\n\n00:20:03.478 --> 00:20:05.669\nand it's affecting\nthe future of our children.\n\n00:20:05.693 --> 00:20:10.734\nAnd so surely I think that is the heart\nof the problem of climate change today.\n\n00:20:10.758 --> 00:20:13.814\nWe will be meeting in Paris\nat the end of this year,\n\n00:20:13.838 --> 00:20:17.774\nbut until we can think of this\nas a global phenomenon,\n\n00:20:17.798 --> 00:20:21.054\nbecause we create it,\nindividually, as nations,\n\n00:20:21.078 --> 00:20:23.014\nbut it affects everybody else,\n\n00:20:23.038 --> 00:20:26.654\nand yet, we refuse\nto do anything about it,\n\n00:20:26.678 --> 00:20:29.134\nand we deal with it as a national problem,\n\n00:20:29.158 --> 00:20:31.254\nwhich it is not -- it is a global issue,\n\n00:20:31.278 --> 00:20:33.998\nand it's got to be\ndealt with collectively.\n\n00:20:35.078 --> 00:20:39.414\nCA: People are incredibly bad\nat responding to graphs and numbers,\n\n00:20:39.438 --> 00:20:43.214\nand we shut our minds to it.\n\n00:20:43.238 --> 00:20:49.494\nSomehow, to people, we're slightly better\nat responding to that sometimes.\n\n00:20:49.518 --> 00:20:52.454\nAnd it seems like it's\nvery possible that your nation,\n\n00:20:52.478 --> 00:20:56.934\ndespite, actually because of\nthe intense problems you face,\n\n00:20:56.958 --> 00:21:01.854\nyou may yet be the warning light\nto the world that shines most visibly,\n\n00:21:01.878 --> 00:21:03.854\nmost powerfully.\n\n00:21:03.878 --> 00:21:06.695\nI just want to thank you, \nI'm sure, on behalf of all of us,\n\n00:21:06.720 --> 00:21:09.214\nfor your extraordinary leadership\nand for being here.\n\n00:21:09.238 --> 00:21:10.811\nMr. President, thank you so much.\n\n00:21:10.831 --> 00:21:11.604\nAT: Thank you.\n\n00:21:11.624 --> 00:21:14.078\n(Applause)"}, {"title": "What are animals thinking and feeling?", "duration": "1166", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/carl_safina_what_are_animals_thinking_and_feeling", "transcript": "Have you ever wondered what animals think and feel? Let's start with a question: Does my dog really love me, or does she just want a treat? Well, it's easy to see that our dog really loves us, easy to see, right, what's going on in that fuzzy little head. What is going on? Something's going on.But why is the question always do they love us? Why is it always about us? Why are we such narcissists? I found a different question to ask animals. Who are you?There are capacities of the human mind that we tend to think are capacities only of the human mind. But is that true? What are other beings doing with those brains? What are they thinking and feeling? Is there a way to know? I think there is a way in. I think there are several ways in. We can look at evolution, we can look at their brains and we can watch what they do.The first thing to remember is: our brain is inherited. The first neurons came from jellyfish. Jellyfish gave rise to the first chordates. The first chordates gave rise to the first vertebrates. The vertebrates came out of the sea, and here we are. But it's still true that a neuron, a nerve cell, looks the same in a crayfish, a bird or you. What does that say about the minds of crayfish? Can we tell anything about that? Well, it turns out that if you give a crayfish a lot of little tiny electric shocks every time it tries to come out of its burrow, it will develop anxiety. If you give the crayfish the same drug used to treat anxiety disorder in humans, it relaxes and comes out and explores. How do we show how much we care about crayfish anxiety? Mostly, we boil them.(Laughter)Octopuses use tools, as well as do most apes and they recognize human faces. How do we celebrate the ape-like intelligence of this invertebrate? Mostly boiled. If a grouper chases a fish into a crevice in the coral, it will sometimes go to where it knows a moray eel is sleeping and it will signal to the moray, \"Follow me,\" and the moray will understand that signal. The moray may go into the crevice and get the fish, but the fish may bolt and the grouper may get it. This is an ancient partnership that we have just recently found out about. How do we celebrate that ancient partnership? Mostly fried. A pattern is emerging and it says a lot more about us than it does about them.Sea otters use tools and they take time away from what they're doing to show their babies what to do, which is called teaching. Chimpanzees don't teach. Killer whales teach and killer whales share food.When evolution makes something new, it uses the parts it has in stock, off the shelf, before it fabricates a new twist. And our brain has come to us through the enormity of the deep sweep of time. If you look at the human brain compared to a chimpanzee brain, what you see is we have basically a very big chimpanzee brain. It's a good thing ours is bigger, because we're also really insecure.(Laughter)But, uh oh, there's a dolphin, a bigger brain with more convolutions. OK, maybe you're saying, all right, well, we see brains, but what does that have to say about minds? Well, we can see the working of the mind in the logic of behaviors. So these elephants, you can see, obviously, they are resting. They have found a patch of shade under the palm trees under which to let their babies sleep, while they doze but remain vigilant. We make perfect sense of that image just as they make perfect sense of what they're doing because under the arc of the same sun on the same plains, listening to the howls of the same dangers, they became who they are and we became who we are.We've been neighbors for a very long time. No one would mistake these elephants as being relaxed. They're obviously very concerned about something. What are they concerned about? It turns out that if you record the voices of tourists and you play that recording from a speaker hidden in bushes, elephants will ignore it, because tourists never bother elephants. But if you record the voices of herders who carry spears and often hurt elephants in confrontations at water holes, the elephants will bunch up and run away from the hidden speaker. Not only do elephants know that there are humans, they know that there are different kinds of humans, and that some are OK and some are dangerous.They have been watching us for much longer than we have been watching them. They know us better than we know them. We have the same imperatives: take care of our babies, find food, try to stay alive. Whether we're outfitted for hiking in the hills of Africa or outfitted for diving under the sea, we are basically the same. We are kin under the skin. The elephant has the same skeleton, the killer whale has the same skeleton, as do we. We see helping where help is needed. We see curiosity in the young. We see the bonds of family connections. We recognize affection. Courtship is courtship. And then we ask, \"Are they conscious?\"When you get general anesthesia, it makes you unconscious, which means you have no sensation of anything. Consciousness is simply the thing that feels like something. If you see, if you hear, if you feel, if you're aware of anything, you are conscious, and they are conscious.Some people say well, there are certain things that make humans humans, and one of those things is empathy. Empathy is the mind's ability to match moods with your companions. It's a very useful thing. If your companions start to move quickly, you have to feel like you need to hurry up. We're all in a hurry now. The oldest form of empathy is contagious fear. If your companions suddenly startle and fly away, it does not work very well for you to say, \"Jeez, I wonder why everybody just left.\"(Laughter)Empathy is old, but empathy, like everything else in life, comes on a sliding scale and has its elaboration. So there's basic empathy: you feel sad, it makes me sad. I see you happy, it makes me happy.Then there's something that I call sympathy, a little more removed: \"I'm sorry to hear that your grandmother has just passed away. I don't feel that same grief, but I get it; I know what you feel and it concerns me.\"And then if we're motivated to act on sympathy, I call that compassion.Far from being the thing that makes us human, human empathy is far from perfect. We round up empathic creatures, we kill them and we eat them. Now, maybe you say OK, well, those are different species. That's just predation, and humans are predators. But we don't treat our own kind too well either. People who seem to know only one thing about animal behavior know that you must never attribute human thoughts and emotions to other species. Well, I think that's silly, because attributing human thoughts and emotions to other species is the best first guess about what they're doing and how they're feeling, because their brains are basically the same as ours. They have the same structures. The same hormones that create mood and motivation in us are in those brains as well. It is not scientific to say that they are hungry when they're hunting and they're tired when their tongues are hanging out, and then say when they're playing with their children and acting joyful and happy, we have no idea if they can possibly be experiencing anything. That is not scientific.So OK, so a reporter said to me, \"Maybe, but how do you really know that other animals can think and feel?\" And I started to rifle through all the hundreds of scientific references that I put in my book and I realized that the answer was right in the room with me. When my dog gets off the rug and comes over to me \u2014 not to the couch, to me \u2014 and she rolls over on her back and exposes her belly, she has had the thought, \"I would like my belly rubbed. I know that I can go over to Carl, he will understand what I'm asking. I know I can trust him because we're family. He'll get the job done, and it will feel good.\"(Laughter)She has thought and she has felt, and it's really not more complicated than that.But we see other animals and we say, \"Oh look, killer whales, wolves, elephants: that's not how they see it.\"That tall-finned male is L41. He's 38 years old. The female right on his left side is L22. She's 44. They've known each other for decades. They know exactly who they are. They know who their friends are. They know who their rivals are. Their life follows the arc of a career. They know where they are all the time.This is an elephant named Philo. He was a young male. This is him four days later. Humans not only can feel grief, we create an awful lot of it. We want to carve their teeth. Why can't we wait for them to die? Elephants once ranged from the shores of the Mediterranean Sea all the way down to the Cape of Good Hope. In 1980, there were vast strongholds of elephant range in Central and Eastern Africa. And now their range is shattered into little shards. This is the geography of an animal that we are driving to extinction, a fellow being, the most magnificent creature on land.Of course, we take much better care of our wildlife in the United States. In Yellowstone National Park, we killed every single wolf. We killed every single wolf south of the Canadian border, actually. But in the park, park rangers did that in the 1920s, and then 60 years later they had to bring them back, because the elk numbers had gotten out of control. And then people came. People came by the thousands to see the wolves, the most accessibly visible wolves in the world.And I went there and I watched this incredible family of wolves. A pack is a family. It has some breeding adults and the young of several generations. And I watched the most famous, most stable pack in Yellowstone National Park. And then, when they wandered just outside the border, two of their adults were killed, including the mother, which we sometimes call the alpha female. The rest of the family immediately descended into sibling rivalry. Sisters kicked out other sisters. That one on the left tried for days to rejoin her family. They wouldn't let her because they were jealous of her. She was getting too much attention from two new males, and she was the precocious one. That was too much for them. She wound up wandering outside the park and getting shot. The alpha male wound up being ejected from his own family. As winter was coming in, he lost his territory, his hunting support, the members of his family and his mate.We cause so much pain to them. The mystery is, why don't they hurt us more than they do? This whale had just finished eating part of a grey whale with his companions who had killed that whale. Those people in the boat had nothing at all to fear. This whale is T20. He had just finished tearing a seal into three pieces with two companions. The seal weighed about as much as the people in the boat. They had nothing to fear. They eat seals. Why don't they eat us? Why can we trust them around our toddlers? Why is it that killer whales have returned to researchers lost in thick fog and led them miles until the fog parted and the researchers' home was right there on the shoreline? And that's happened more than one time.In the Bahamas, there's a woman named Denise Herzing, and she studies spotted dolphins and they know her. She knows them very well. She knows who they all are. They know her. They recognize the research boat. When she shows up, it's a big happy reunion. Except, one time showed up and they didn't want to come near the boat, and that was really strange. And they couldn't figure out what was going on until somebody came out on deck and announced that one of the people onboard had died during a nap in his bunk. How could dolphins know that one of the human hearts had just stopped? Why would they care? And why would it spook them? These mysterious things just hint at all of the things that are going on in the minds that are with us on Earth that we almost never think about at all.At an aquarium in South Africa was a little baby bottle-nosed dolphin named Dolly. She was nursing, and one day a keeper took a cigarette break and he was looking into the window into their pool, smoking. Dolly came over and looked at him, went back to her mother, nursed for a minute or two, came back to the window and released a cloud of milk that enveloped her head like smoke. Somehow, this baby bottle-nosed dolphin got the idea of using milk to represent smoke. When human beings use one thing to represent another, we call that art.(Laughter)The things that make us human are not the things that we think make us human. What makes us human is that, of all these things that our minds and their minds have, we are the most extreme. We are the most compassionate, most violent, most creative and most destructive animal that has ever been on this planet, and we are all of those things all jumbled up together. But love is not the thing that makes us human. It's not special to us. We are not the only ones who care about our mates. We are not the only ones who care about our children.Albatrosses frequently fly six, sometimes ten thousand miles over several weeks to deliver one meal, one big meal, to their chick who is waiting for them. They nest on the most remote islands in the oceans of the world, and this is what it looks like. Passing life from one generation to the next is the chain of being. If that stops, it all goes away. If anything is sacred, that is, and into that sacred relationship comes our plastic trash. All of these birds have plastic in them now. This is an albatross six months old, ready to fledge \u2014 died, packed with red cigarette lighters.This is not the relationship we are supposed to have with the rest of the world. But we, who have named ourselves after our brains, never think about the consequences. When we welcome new human life into the world, we welcome our babies into the company of other creatures. We paint animals on the walls. We don't paint cell phones. We don't paint work cubicles. We paint animals to show them that we are not alone. We have company. And every one of those animals in every painting of Noah's ark, deemed worthy of salvation is in mortal danger now, and their flood is us.So we started with a question: Do they love us? We're going to ask another question. Are we capable of using what we have to care enough to simply let them continue?Thank you very much.(Applause)", "id": 2373, "subtitle":

00:04:14.359\nthrough the enormity\nof the deep sweep of time.\n\n00:04:14.383 --> 00:04:17.972\nIf you look at the human brain\ncompared to a chimpanzee brain,\n\n00:04:17.996 --> 00:04:21.660\nwhat you see is we have basically\na very big chimpanzee brain.\n\n00:04:21.684 --> 00:04:25.625\nIt's a good thing ours is bigger,\nbecause we're also really insecure.\n\n00:04:25.649 --> 00:04:27.711\n(Laughter)\n\n00:04:27.735 --> 00:04:30.851\nBut, uh oh, there's a dolphin,\n\n00:04:30.875 --> 00:04:33.851\na bigger brain with more convolutions.\n\n00:04:34.735 --> 00:04:37.442\nOK, maybe you're saying,\nall right, well, we see brains,\n\n00:04:37.466 --> 00:04:39.893\nbut what does that\nhave to say about minds?\n\n00:04:40.305 --> 00:04:44.176\nWell, we can see the working of the mind\n\n00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:45.909\nin the logic of behaviors.\n\n00:04:46.488 --> 00:04:50.119\nSo these elephants, you can see,\n\n00:04:50.143 --> 00:04:52.743\nobviously, they are resting.\n\n00:04:53.076 --> 00:04:57.440\nThey have found a patch of shade\nunder the palm trees\n\n00:04:57.464 --> 00:05:00.264\nunder which to let their babies sleep,\n\n00:05:00.288 --> 00:05:02.907\nwhile they doze but remain vigilant.\n\n00:05:03.449 --> 00:05:06.301\nWe make perfect sense of that image\n\n00:05:06.325 --> 00:05:09.956\njust as they make perfect sense\nof what they're doing\n\n00:05:09.980 --> 00:05:13.782\nbecause under the arc of the same sun\non the same plains,\n\n00:05:13.806 --> 00:05:17.232\nlistening to the howls\nof the same dangers,\n\n00:05:17.256 --> 00:05:21.667\nthey became who they are\nand we became who we are.\n\n00:05:22.494 --> 00:05:24.670\nWe've been neighbors for a very long time.\n\n00:05:24.694 --> 00:05:28.138\nNo one would mistake\nthese elephants as being relaxed.\n\n00:05:28.162 --> 00:05:31.074\nThey're obviously very\nconcerned about something.\n\n00:05:31.098 --> 00:05:33.074\nWhat are they concerned about?\n\n00:05:33.638 --> 00:05:37.278\nIt turns out that if you record\nthe voices of tourists\n\n00:05:37.302 --> 00:05:41.996\nand you play that recording\nfrom a speaker hidden in bushes,\n\n00:05:42.020 --> 00:05:45.655\nelephants will ignore it,\nbecause tourists never bother elephants.\n\n00:05:46.060 --> 00:05:50.802\nBut if you record the voices of herders\n\n00:05:50.826 --> 00:05:55.915\nwho carry spears and often hurt elephants\nin confrontations at water holes,\n\n00:05:55.939 --> 00:06:00.633\nthe elephants will bunch up\nand run away from the hidden speaker.\n\n00:06:00.657 --> 00:06:04.016\nNot only do elephants know\nthat there are humans,\n\n00:06:04.040 --> 00:06:06.576\nthey know that there are\ndifferent kinds of humans,\n\n00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:10.182\nand that some are OK\nand some are dangerous.\n\n00:06:10.206 --> 00:06:15.273\nThey have been watching us for much longer\nthan we have been watching them.\n\n00:06:15.297 --> 00:06:17.587\nThey know us better than we know them.\n\n00:06:18.230 --> 00:06:21.078\nWe have the same imperatives:\n\n00:06:21.102 --> 00:06:25.597\ntake care of our babies,\nfind food, try to stay alive.\n\n00:06:26.436 --> 00:06:30.265\nWhether we're outfitted for hiking\nin the hills of Africa\n\n00:06:30.289 --> 00:06:34.472\nor outfitted for diving under the sea,\nwe are basically the same.\n\n00:06:34.496 --> 00:06:36.474\nWe are kin under the skin.\n\n00:06:36.957 --> 00:06:39.360\nThe elephant has the same skeleton,\n\n00:06:39.384 --> 00:06:41.726\nthe killer whale has the same skeleton,\n\n00:06:41.750 --> 00:06:42.986\nas do we.\n\n00:06:45.632 --> 00:06:47.894\nWe see helping where help is needed.\n\n00:06:48.518 --> 00:06:51.146\nWe see curiosity in the young.\n\n00:06:52.425 --> 00:06:56.028\nWe see the bonds of family connections.\n\n00:06:57.734 --> 00:06:59.781\nWe recognize affection.\n\n00:07:00.480 --> 00:07:02.641\nCourtship is courtship.\n\n00:07:03.957 --> 00:07:06.640\nAnd then we ask, \"Are they conscious?\"\n\n00:07:07.258 --> 00:07:10.158\nWhen you get general anesthesia,\nit makes you unconscious,\n\n00:07:10.182 --> 00:07:13.017\nwhich means you have\nno sensation of anything.\n\n00:07:13.041 --> 00:07:16.612\nConsciousness is simply\nthe thing that feels like something.\n\n00:07:17.250 --> 00:07:21.399\nIf you see, if you hear, if you feel,\nif you're aware of anything,\n\n00:07:21.423 --> 00:07:24.475\nyou are conscious, and they are conscious.\n\n00:07:27.123 --> 00:07:28.289\nSome people say\n\n00:07:28.313 --> 00:07:30.918\nwell, there are certain things\nthat make humans humans,\n\n00:07:30.942 --> 00:07:32.864\nand one of those things is empathy.\n\n00:07:32.888 --> 00:07:38.575\nEmpathy is the mind's ability\nto match moods with your companions.\n\n00:07:39.400 --> 00:07:40.983\nIt's a very useful thing.\n\n00:07:41.007 --> 00:07:43.167\nIf your companions start to move quickly,\n\n00:07:43.191 --> 00:07:45.426\nyou have to feel like\nyou need to hurry up.\n\n00:07:45.450 --> 00:07:47.180\nWe're all in a hurry now.\n\n00:07:47.204 --> 00:07:50.691\nThe oldest form of empathy\nis contagious fear.\n\n00:07:50.715 --> 00:07:53.561\nIf your companions suddenly\nstartle and fly away,\n\n00:07:53.585 --> 00:07:55.749\nit does not work very well for you to say,\n\n00:07:55.773 --> 00:07:58.676\n\"Jeez, I wonder why everybody just left.\"\n\n00:07:58.700 --> 00:08:00.232\n(Laughter)\n\n00:08:03.094 --> 00:08:06.933\nEmpathy is old, but empathy,\nlike everything else in life,\n\n00:08:06.957 --> 00:08:10.868\ncomes on a sliding scale\nand has its elaboration.\n\n00:08:10.892 --> 00:08:14.613\nSo there's basic empathy:\nyou feel sad, it makes me sad.\n\n00:08:14.637 --> 00:08:16.574\nI see you happy, it makes me happy.\n\n00:08:17.150 --> 00:08:19.933\nThen there's something\nthat I call sympathy,\n\n00:08:19.957 --> 00:08:21.817\na little more removed:\n\n00:08:22.323 --> 00:08:25.790\n\"I'm sorry to hear that your grandmother\nhas just passed away.\n\n00:08:25.814 --> 00:08:29.441\nI don't feel that same grief,\nbut I get it; I know what you feel\n\n00:08:29.465 --> 00:08:30.878\nand it concerns me.\"\n\n00:08:30.902 --> 00:08:33.519\nAnd then if we're motivated\nto act on sympathy,\n\n00:08:33.543 --> 00:08:35.349\nI call that compassion.\n\n00:08:36.019 --> 00:08:39.569\nFar from being the thing\nthat makes us human,\n\n00:08:39.593 --> 00:08:42.933\nhuman empathy is far from perfect.\n\n00:08:42.957 --> 00:08:47.968\nWe round up empathic creatures,\nwe kill them and we eat them.\n\n00:08:47.992 --> 00:08:50.859\nNow, maybe you say OK,\nwell, those are different species.\n\n00:08:50.883 --> 00:08:54.601\nThat's just predation,\nand humans are predators.\n\n00:08:54.625 --> 00:08:59.961\nBut we don't treat our own kind\ntoo well either.\n\n00:09:01.170 --> 00:09:04.324\nPeople who seem to know\nonly one thing about animal behavior\n\n00:09:04.348 --> 00:09:08.321\nknow that you must never attribute\nhuman thoughts and emotions\n\n00:09:08.345 --> 00:09:10.146\nto other species.\n\n00:09:10.681 --> 00:09:12.502\nWell, I think that's silly,\n\n00:09:12.526 --> 00:09:16.648\nbecause attributing human thoughts\nand emotions to other species\n\n00:09:16.672 --> 00:09:20.923\nis the best first guess about what\nthey're doing and how they're feeling,\n\n00:09:20.947 --> 00:09:24.260\nbecause their brains\nare basically the same as ours.\n\n00:09:24.284 --> 00:09:26.015\nThey have the same structures.\n\n00:09:26.039 --> 00:09:31.089\nThe same hormones that create\nmood and motivation in us\n\n00:09:31.113 --> 00:09:33.371\nare in those brains as well.\n\n00:09:35.008 --> 00:09:40.078\nIt is not scientific to say that they\nare hungry when they're hunting\n\n00:09:40.102 --> 00:09:43.049\nand they're tired when\ntheir tongues are hanging out,\n\n00:09:43.073 --> 00:09:45.763\nand then say when they're playing\nwith their children\n\n00:09:45.787 --> 00:09:47.698\nand acting joyful and happy,\n\n00:09:47.722 --> 00:09:52.511\nwe have no idea if they can possibly\nbe experiencing anything.\n\n00:09:52.535 --> 00:09:54.529\nThat is not scientific.\n\n00:09:55.577 --> 00:09:58.262\nSo OK, so a reporter said to me,\n\n00:09:58.286 --> 00:10:02.594\n\"Maybe, but how do you really know\nthat other animals can think and feel?\"\n\n00:10:02.618 --> 00:10:05.673\nAnd I started to rifle\nthrough all the hundreds\n\n00:10:05.697 --> 00:10:08.196\nof scientific references\nthat I put in my book\n\n00:10:08.220 --> 00:10:11.460\nand I realized that the answer\nwas right in the room with me.\n\n00:10:11.484 --> 00:10:15.237\nWhen my dog gets off the rug\nand comes over to me --\n\n00:10:15.261 --> 00:10:17.023\nnot to the couch, to me --\n\n00:10:17.047 --> 00:10:21.224\nand she rolls over on her back\nand exposes her belly,\n\n00:10:21.248 --> 00:10:24.116\nshe has had the thought,\n\"I would like my belly rubbed.\n\n00:10:26.523 --> 00:10:29.059\nI know that I can go over to Carl,\n\n00:10:29.083 --> 00:10:31.396\nhe will understand what I'm asking.\n\n00:10:32.042 --> 00:10:34.538\nI know I can trust him\nbecause we're family.\n\n00:10:35.364 --> 00:10:38.079\nHe'll get the job done,\nand it will feel good.\"\n\n00:10:38.103 --> 00:10:39.989\n(Laughter)\n\n00:10:40.013 --> 00:10:43.342\nShe has thought and she has felt,\n\n00:10:43.366 --> 00:10:46.030\nand it's really not\nmore complicated than that.\n\n00:10:46.054 --> 00:10:50.667\nBut we see other animals\nand we say, \"Oh look, killer whales,\n\n00:10:50.691 --> 00:10:53.101\nwolves, elephants:\n\n00:10:53.125 --> 00:10:54.736\nthat's not how they see it.\"\n\n00:10:55.672 --> 00:10:59.966\nThat tall-finned male is L41.\n\n00:10:59.990 --> 00:11:02.037\nHe's 38 years old.\n\n00:11:02.061 --> 00:11:05.533\nThe female right on his left side is L22.\n\n00:11:05.857 --> 00:11:07.409\nShe's 44.\n\n00:11:07.433 --> 00:11:10.068\nThey've known each other for decades.\n\n00:11:10.608 --> 00:11:12.580\nThey know exactly who they are.\n\n00:11:12.604 --> 00:11:14.155\nThey know who their friends are.\n\n00:11:14.179 --> 00:11:15.877\nThey know who their rivals are.\n\n00:11:15.901 --> 00:11:18.014\nTheir life follows the arc of a career.\n\n00:11:18.760 --> 00:11:20.994\nThey know where they are all the time.\n\n00:11:22.821 --> 00:11:25.196\nThis is an elephant named Philo.\n\n00:11:25.625 --> 00:11:27.453\nHe was a young male.\n\n00:11:27.477 --> 00:11:29.295\nThis is him four days later.\n\n00:11:30.957 --> 00:11:36.287\nHumans not only can feel grief,\nwe create an awful lot of it.\n\n00:11:38.606 --> 00:11:40.920\nWe want to carve their teeth.\n\n00:11:42.111 --> 00:11:45.415\nWhy can't we wait for them to die?\n\n00:11:47.956 --> 00:11:51.424\nElephants once ranged from the shores\nof the Mediterranean Sea\n\n00:11:51.448 --> 00:11:53.523\nall the way down to the Cape of Good Hope.\n\n00:11:53.547 --> 00:11:56.933\nIn 1980, there were vast\nstrongholds of elephant range\n\n00:11:56.957 --> 00:11:59.145\nin Central and Eastern Africa.\n\n00:11:59.169 --> 00:12:03.506\nAnd now their range is shattered\ninto little shards.\n\n00:12:03.530 --> 00:12:08.209\nThis is the geography of an animal\nthat we are driving to extinction,\n\n00:12:08.233 --> 00:12:12.082\na fellow being, the most\nmagnificent creature on land.\n\n00:12:13.246 --> 00:12:17.274\nOf course, we take much better care\nof our wildlife in the United States.\n\n00:12:17.639 --> 00:12:21.874\nIn Yellowstone National Park,\nwe killed every single wolf.\n\n00:12:21.898 --> 00:12:25.347\nWe killed every single wolf\nsouth of the Canadian border, actually.\n\n00:12:25.371 --> 00:12:29.764\nBut in the park, park rangers\ndid that in the 1920s,\n\n00:12:29.788 --> 00:12:32.379\nand then 60 years later\nthey had to bring them back,\n\n00:12:32.403 --> 00:12:35.310\nbecause the elk numbers\nhad gotten out of control.\n\n00:12:36.469 --> 00:12:37.743\nAnd then people came.\n\n00:12:37.767 --> 00:12:41.491\nPeople came by the thousands\nto see the wolves,\n\n00:12:41.515 --> 00:12:45.010\nthe most accessibly\nvisible wolves in the world.\n\n00:12:45.470 --> 00:12:48.722\nAnd I went there and I watched\nthis incredible family of wolves.\n\n00:12:48.746 --> 00:12:50.199\nA pack is a family.\n\n00:12:50.223 --> 00:12:53.798\nIt has some breeding adults\nand the young of several generations.\n\n00:12:55.116 --> 00:12:59.732\nAnd I watched the most famous, most stable\npack in Yellowstone National Park.\n\n00:13:00.328 --> 00:13:03.458\nAnd then, when they wandered\njust outside the border,\n\n00:13:03.482 --> 00:13:06.163\ntwo of their adults were killed,\n\n00:13:06.187 --> 00:13:08.440\nincluding the mother,\n\n00:13:08.464 --> 00:13:10.642\nwhich we sometimes call the alpha female.\n\n00:13:11.460 --> 00:13:15.703\nThe rest of the family immediately\ndescended into sibling rivalry.\n\n00:13:16.829 --> 00:13:19.070\nSisters kicked out other sisters.\n\n00:13:19.523 --> 00:13:23.004\nThat one on the left tried for days\nto rejoin her family.\n\n00:13:23.028 --> 00:13:25.720\nThey wouldn't let her\nbecause they were jealous of her.\n\n00:13:25.744 --> 00:13:28.557\nShe was getting too much attention\nfrom two new males,\n\n00:13:28.581 --> 00:13:30.599\nand she was the precocious one.\n\n00:13:30.623 --> 00:13:32.276\nThat was too much for them.\n\n00:13:32.300 --> 00:13:35.025\nShe wound up wandering\noutside the park and getting shot.\n\n00:13:36.421 --> 00:13:39.830\nThe alpha male wound up\nbeing ejected from his own family.\n\n00:13:40.394 --> 00:13:42.397\nAs winter was coming in,\n\n00:13:42.421 --> 00:13:46.171\nhe lost his territory,\nhis hunting support,\n\n00:13:46.195 --> 00:13:48.666\nthe members of his family and his mate.\n\n00:13:50.841 --> 00:13:54.465\nWe cause so much pain to them.\n\n00:13:55.623 --> 00:14:00.583\nThe mystery is, why don't\nthey hurt us more than they do?\n\n00:14:01.813 --> 00:14:05.011\nThis whale had just finished eating\npart of a grey whale\n\n00:14:05.035 --> 00:14:07.614\nwith his companions\nwho had killed that whale.\n\n00:14:07.638 --> 00:14:10.722\nThose people in the boat\nhad nothing at all to fear.\n\n00:14:11.957 --> 00:14:13.946\nThis whale is T20.\n\n00:14:14.446 --> 00:14:18.697\nHe had just finished tearing a seal\ninto three pieces with two companions.\n\n00:14:19.126 --> 00:14:21.818\nThe seal weighed about as much\nas the people in the boat.\n\n00:14:21.842 --> 00:14:23.345\nThey had nothing to fear.\n\n00:14:24.147 -->

00:14:42.348\nWhy is it that killer whales have returned\nto researchers lost in thick fog\n\n00:14:42.372 --> 00:14:45.702\nand led them miles until the fog parted\n\n00:14:45.726 --> 00:14:48.891\nand the researchers' home\nwas right there on the shoreline?\n\n00:14:48.915 --> 00:14:50.931\nAnd that's happened more than one time.\n\n00:14:53.129 --> 00:14:55.704\nIn the Bahamas, there's a woman\nnamed Denise Herzing,\n\n00:14:55.728 --> 00:14:59.052\nand she studies spotted dolphins\nand they know her.\n\n00:14:59.076 --> 00:15:01.674\nShe knows them very well.\nShe knows who they all are.\n\n00:15:01.698 --> 00:15:03.960\nThey know her.\nThey recognize the research boat.\n\n00:15:03.984 --> 00:15:06.214\nWhen she shows up,\nit's a big happy reunion.\n\n00:15:06.238 --> 00:15:09.553\nExcept, one time showed up and they\ndidn't want to come near the boat,\n\n00:15:09.577 --> 00:15:11.651\nand that was really strange.\n\n00:15:11.675 --> 00:15:13.839\nAnd they couldn't figure out\nwhat was going on\n\n00:15:13.863 --> 00:15:15.363\nuntil somebody came out on deck\n\n00:15:15.387 --> 00:15:18.022\nand announced that one\nof the people onboard had died\n\n00:15:18.046 --> 00:15:19.817\nduring a nap in his bunk.\n\n00:15:20.698 --> 00:15:24.624\nHow could dolphins know\nthat one of the human hearts\n\n00:15:24.648 --> 00:15:26.117\nhad just stopped?\n\n00:15:26.776 --> 00:15:29.066\nWhy would they care?\n\n00:15:29.090 --> 00:15:31.283\nAnd why would it spook them?\n\n00:15:33.069 --> 00:15:38.368\nThese mysterious things just hint at\nall of the things that are going on\n\n00:15:38.392 --> 00:15:41.134\nin the minds that are with us on Earth\n\n00:15:41.158 --> 00:15:45.389\nthat we almost never think about at all.\n\n00:15:46.216 --> 00:15:48.388\nAt an aquarium in South Africa\n\n00:15:48.412 --> 00:15:51.636\nwas a little baby bottle-nosed\ndolphin named Dolly.\n\n00:15:52.136 --> 00:15:58.280\nShe was nursing, and one day\na keeper took a cigarette break\n\n00:15:58.304 --> 00:16:02.411\nand he was looking into the window\ninto their pool, smoking.\n\n00:16:02.435 --> 00:16:04.809\nDolly came over and looked at him,\n\n00:16:04.833 --> 00:16:08.711\nwent back to her mother,\nnursed for a minute or two,\n\n00:16:08.735 --> 00:16:10.538\ncame back to the window\n\n00:16:10.562 --> 00:16:16.227\nand released a cloud of milk\nthat enveloped her head like smoke.\n\n00:16:16.251 --> 00:16:19.357\nSomehow, this baby bottle-nosed dolphin\n\n00:16:19.381 --> 00:16:23.670\ngot the idea of using milk\nto represent smoke.\n\n00:16:24.169 --> 00:16:27.517\nWhen human beings use one thing\nto represent another,\n\n00:16:27.541 --> 00:16:29.566\nwe call that art.\n\n00:16:29.590 --> 00:16:31.613\n(Laughter)\n\n00:16:31.637 --> 00:16:33.168\nThe things that make us human\n\n00:16:33.192 --> 00:16:36.272\nare not the things\nthat we think make us human.\n\n00:16:36.739 --> 00:16:39.063\nWhat makes us human is that,\n\n00:16:39.087 --> 00:16:42.223\nof all these things that our minds\nand their minds have,\n\n00:16:42.247 --> 00:16:44.487\nwe are the most extreme.\n\n00:16:46.305 --> 00:16:48.594\nWe are the most compassionate,\n\n00:16:48.618 --> 00:16:51.635\nmost violent, most creative\n\n00:16:51.659 --> 00:16:56.319\nand most destructive animal\nthat has ever been on this planet,\n\n00:16:56.343 --> 00:17:00.067\nand we are all of those things\nall jumbled up together.\n\n00:17:01.299 --> 00:17:05.537\nBut love is not the thing\nthat makes us human.\n\n00:17:06.200 --> 00:17:08.552\nIt's not special to us.\n\n00:17:09.632 --> 00:17:13.603\nWe are not the only ones\nwho care about our mates.\n\n00:17:13.627 --> 00:17:16.965\nWe are not the only ones\nwho care about our children.\n\n00:17:18.862 --> 00:17:23.832\nAlbatrosses frequently fly six,\nsometimes ten thousand miles\n\n00:17:23.856 --> 00:17:28.343\nover several weeks to

world,\n\n00:17:35.215 --> 00:17:37.588\nand this is what it looks like.\n\n00:17:39.328 --> 00:17:43.508\nPassing life from one generation\nto the next is the chain of being.\n\n00:17:43.532 --> 00:17:46.508\nIf that stops, it all goes away.\n\n00:17:46.933 --> 00:17:51.583\nIf anything is sacred, that is,\nand into that sacred relationship\n\n00:17:51.607 --> 00:17:54.438\ncomes our plastic trash.\n\n00:17:54.462 --> 00:17:57.149\nAll of these birds\nhave plastic in them now.\n\n00:17:57.948 --> 00:18:02.599\nThis is an albatross six months old,\nready to fledge --\n\n00:18:02.623 --> 00:18:06.624\ndied, packed with red cigarette lighters.\n\n00:18:06.648 --> 00:18:09.933\nThis is not the relationship\nwe are supposed to have\n\n00:18:09.957 --> 00:18:11.543\nwith the rest of the world.\n\n00:18:11.567 --> 00:18:14.891\nBut we, who have named\nourselves after our brains,\n\n00:18:16.153 --> 00:18:19.539\nnever think about the consequences.\n\n00:18:20.999 -->

what we have\n\n00:19:09.876 --> 00:19:14.049\nto care enough to simply\nlet them continue?\n\n00:19:16.683 --> 00:19:18.024\nThank you very much.\n\n00:19:18.048 --> 00:19:23.688\n(Applause)"},

limestone cliff that draws you in. As you pass through the portal between light and dark, you enter a subterranean world \u2014 a place of perpetual gloom, of earthy smells, of hushed silence.Long ago in Europe, ancient people also entered these underground worlds. As witness to their passage, they left behind mysterious engravings and paintings, like this panel of humans, triangles and zigzags from Ojo Guare\u00f1a in Spain. You now walk the same path as these early artists. And in this surreal, otherworldly place, it's almost possible to imagine that you hear the muffled footfall of skin boots on soft earth, or that you see the flickering of a torch around the next bend.When I'm in a cave, I often find myself wondering what drove these people to go so deep to brave dangerous and narrow passageways to leave their mark? In this video clip, that was shot half a kilometer, or about a third of a mile, underground, in the cave of Cudon in Spain, we found a series of red paintings on a ceiling in a previously unexplored section of the cave. As we crawled forward, military-style, with the ceiling getting ever lower, we finally got to a point where the ceiling was so low that my husband and project photographer, Dylan, could no longer achieve focus on the ceiling with his DSLR camera. So while he filmed me, I kept following the trail of red paint with a single light and a point-and-shoot camera that we kept for that type of occasion. Half a kilometer underground.Seriously. What was somebody doing down there with a torch or a stone lamp?(Laughter)I mean \u2014 me, it makes sense, right?But you know, this is the kind of question that I'm trying to answer with my research. I study some of the oldest art in the world. It was created by these early artists in Europe, between 10,000 and 40,000 years ago. And the thing is that I'm not just studying it because it's beautiful, though some of it certainly is. But what I'm interested in is the development of the modern mind, of the evolution of creativity, of imagination, of abstract thought, about what it means to be human. While all species communicate in one way or another, only we humans have really taken it to another level. Our desire and ability to share and collaborate has been a huge part of our success story. Our modern world is based on a global network of information exchange made possible, in large part, by our ability to communicate \u2014 in particular, using graphic or written forms of communication. The thing is, though, that we've been building on the mental achievements of those that came before us for so long that it's easy to forget that certain abilities haven't already existed. It's one of the things I find most fascinating about studying our deep history. Those people didn't have the shoulders of any giants to stand on. They were the original shoulders. And while a surprising number of important inventions come out of that distant time, what I want to talk to you about today is the invention of graphic communication.There are three main types of communication, spoken, gestural \u2014 so things like sign language \u2014 and graphic communication. Spoken and gestural are by their very nature ephemeral. It requires close contact for a message to be sent and received. And after the moment of transmission, it's gone forever. Graphic communication, on the other hand, decouples that relationship. And with its invention, it became possible for the first time for a message to be transmitted and preserved beyond a single moment in place and time.Europe is one of the first places that we start to see graphic marks regularly appearing in caves, rock shelters and even a few surviving open-air sites. But this is not the Europe we know today. This was a world dominated by towering ice sheets, three to four kilometers high, with sweeping grass plains and frozen tundra. This was the Ice Age.Over the last century, more than 350 Ice Age rock art sites have been found across the continent, decorated with animals, abstract shapes and even the occasional human like these engraved figures from Grotta dell'Addaura in Sicily. They provide us with a rare glimpse into the creative world and imagination of these early artists.Since their discovery, it's been the animals that have received the majority of the study like this black horse from Cullalvera in Spain, or this unusual purple bison from La Pasiega. But for me, it was the abstract shapes, what we call geometric signs, that drew me to study the art. The funny this is that at most sites the geometric signs far outnumber the animal and human images. But when I started on this back in 2007, there wasn't even a definitive list of how many shapes there were, nor was there a strong sense of whether the same ones appeared across space or time. Before I could even get started on my questions, my first step was to compile a database of all known geometric signs from all of the rock art sites. The problem was that while they were well documented at some sites, usually the ones with the very nice animals, there was also a large number of them where it was very vague \u2014 there wasn't a lot of description or detail. Some of them hadn't been visited in half a century or more. These were the ones that I targeted for my field work.Over the course of two years, my faithful husband Dylan and I each spent over 300 hours underground, hiking, crawling and wriggling around 52 sites in France, Spain, Portugal and Sicily. And it was totally worth it. We found new, undocumented geometric signs at 75 percent of the sites we visited. This is the level of accuracy I knew I was going to need if I wanted to start answering those larger questions.So let's get to those answers. Barring a handful of outliers, there are only 32 geometric signs. Only 32 signs across a 30,000-year time span and the entire continent of Europe. That is a very small number. Now, if these were random doodles or decorations, we would expect to see a lot more variation, but instead what we find are the same signs repeating across both space and time. Some signs start out strong, before losing popularity and vanishing, while other signs are later inventions. But 65 percent of those signs stayed in use during that entire time period \u2014 things like lines, rectangles triangles, ovals and circles like we see here from the end of the Ice Age, at a 10,000-year-old site high in the Pyrenees Mountains. And while certain signs span thousands of kilometers, other signs had much more restricted distribution patterns, with some being limited to a single territory, like we see here with these divided rectangles that are only found in northern Spain, and which some researchers have speculated could be some sort of family or clan signs.On a side note, there is surprising degree of similarity in the earliest rock art found all the way from France and Spain to Indonesia and Australia. With many of the same signs appearing in such far-flung places, especially in that 30,000 to 40,000-year range, it's starting to seem increasingly likely that this invention actually traces back to a common point of origin in Africa. But that I'm afraid, is a subject for a future talk.So back to the matter at hand. There could be no doubt that these signs were meaningful to their creators, like these 25,000-year-old bas-relief sculptures from La Roque de Venasque in France. We might not know what they meant, but the people of the time certainly did. The repetition of the same signs, for so long, and at so many sites tells us that the artists were making intentional choices. If we're talking about geometric shapes, with specific, culturally recognized, agreed-upon meanings, than we could very well be looking at one of the oldest systems of graphic communication in the world.I'm not talking about writing yet. There's just not enough characters at this point to have represented all of the words in the spoken language, something which is a requirement for a full writing system. Nor do we see the signs repeating regularly enough to suggest that they were some sort of alphabet. But what we do have are some intriguing one-offs, like this panel from La Pasiega in Spain, known as \"The Inscription,\" with its symmetrical markings on the left, possible stylized representations of hands in the middle, and what looks a bit like a bracket on the right.The oldest systems of graphic communication in the world \u2014 Sumerian cuneiform, Egyptian hieroglyphs, the earliest Chinese script, all emerged between 4,000 and 5,000 years ago, with each coming into existence from an earlier protosystem made up of counting marks and pictographic representations, where the meaning and the image were the same. So a picture of a bird would really have represented that animal. It's only later that we start to see these pictographs become more stylized, until they almost become unrecognizable and that we also start to see more symbols being invented to represent all those other missing words in language \u2014 things like pronouns, adverbs, adjectives.So knowing all this, it seems highly unlikely that the geometric signs from Ice Age Europe were truly abstract written characters. Instead, what's much more likely is that these early artists were also making counting marks, maybe like this row of lines from Riparo di Za Minic in Sicily, as well as creating stylized representations of things from the world around them. Could some of the signs be weaponry or housing? Or what about celestial objects like star constellations? Or maybe even rivers, mountains, trees \u2014 landscape features, possibly like this black penniform surrounded by strange bell-shaped signs from the site of El Castillo in Spain. The term penniform means \"feather-shaped\" in Latin, but could this actually be a depiction of a plant or a tree? Some researchers have begun to ask these questions about certain signs at specific sites, but I believe the time has come to revisit this category as a whole. The irony in all of this, of course, is that having just carefully classified all of the signs into a single category, I have a feeling that my next step will involve breaking it back apart as different types of imagery are identified and separated off.Now don't get me wrong, the later creation of fully developed writing was an impressive feat in its own right. But it's important to remember that those early writing systems didn't come out of a vacuum. And that even 5,000 years ago, people were already building on something much older, with its origins stretching back tens of thousands of years \u2014 to the geometric signs of Ice Age Europe and far beyond, to that point, deep in our collective history, when someone first came up with the idea of making a graphic mark, and forever changed the nature of how we communicate.Thank you.(Applause)",

00:02:49.854\nonly we humans have really\ntaken it to another level.\n\n00:02:49.878 --> 00:02:52.454\nOur desire and ability\nto share and collaborate\n\n00:02:52.478 --> 00:02:55.134\nhas been a huge part of our success story.\n\n00:02:55.158 --> 00:02:59.974\nOur modern world is based on a global\nnetwork of information exchange\n\n00:02:59.998 --> 00:03:04.014\nmade possible, in large part,\nby our ability to communicate --\n\n00:03:04.038 --> 00:03:08.038\nin particular, using graphic\nor written forms of communication.\n\n00:03:08.478 --> 00:03:09.734\nThe thing is, though,\n\n00:03:09.758 --> 00:03:12.294\nthat we've been building\non the mental achievements\n\n00:03:12.318 --> 00:03:15.374\nof those that came before us for so long\n\n00:03:15.398 --> 00:03:19.798\nthat it's easy to forget that certain\nabilities haven't already existed.\n\n00:03:20.718 --> 00:03:23.094\nIt's one of the things\nI find most fascinating\n\n00:03:23.118 --> 00:03:25.694\nabout studying our deep history.\n\n00:03:25.718 --> 00:03:29.814\nThose people didn't have the shoulders\nof any giants to stand on.\n\n00:03:29.838 --> 00:03:32.294\nThey were the original shoulders.\n\n00:03:32.318 --> 00:03:35.214\nAnd while a surprising number\nof important inventions\n\n00:03:35.238 --> 00:03:37.134\ncome out of that distant time,\n\n00:03:37.158 --> 00:03:41.838\nwhat I want to talk to you about today\nis the invention of graphic communication.\n\n00:03:42.638 --> 00:03:44.814\nThere are three\nmain types of communication,\n\n00:03:44.838 --> 00:03:48.214\nspoken, gestural --\nso things like sign language --\n\n00:03:48.238 --> 00:03:50.534\nand graphic communication.\n\n00:03:50.558 --> 00:03:54.214\nSpoken and gestural are\nby their very nature ephemeral.\n\n00:03:54.238 --> 00:03:58.174\nIt requires close contact\nfor a message to be sent and received.\n\n00:03:58.198 --> 00:04:02.134\nAnd after the moment\nof transmission, it's gone forever.\n\n00:04:02.158 --> 00:04:06.134\nGraphic communication, on the other hand,\ndecouples that relationship.\n\n00:04:06.158 --> 00:04:10.134\nAnd with its invention,\nit became possible for the first time\n\n00:04:10.158 --> 00:04:13.014\nfor a message to be\ntransmitted and preserved\n\n00:04:13.038 --> 00:04:16.734\nbeyond a single moment in place and time.\n\n00:04:16.758 --> 00:04:18.534\nEurope is one of the first places\n\n00:04:18.558 --> 00:04:21.254\nthat we start to see graphic marks\nregularly appearing\n\n00:04:21.278 --> 00:04:25.518\nin caves, rock shelters\nand even a few surviving open-air sites.\n\n00:04:26.198 --> 00:04:28.734\nBut this is not the Europe we know today.\n\n00:04:28.758 --> 00:04:31.734\nThis was a world dominated\nby towering ice sheets,\n\n00:04:31.758 --> 00:04:33.734\nthree to four kilometers high,\n\n00:04:33.758 --> 00:04:37.014\nwith sweeping grass plains\nand frozen tundra.\n\n00:04:37.038 --> 00:04:39.078\nThis was the Ice Age.\n\n00:04:40.038 --> 00:04:41.334\nOver the last century,\n\n00:04:41.358 --> 00:04:46.654\nmore than 350 Ice Age rock art sites\nhave been found across the continent,\n\n00:04:46.678 --> 00:04:51.054\ndecorated with animals, abstract shapes\nand even the occasional human\n\n00:04:51.078 --> 00:04:54.694\nlike these engraved figures\nfrom Grotta dell'Addaura in Sicily.\n\n00:04:54.718 --> 00:04:56.774\nThey provide us with a rare glimpse\n\n00:04:56.798 --> 00:05:00.878\ninto the creative world and imagination\nof these early artists.\n\n00:05:01.798 --> 00:05:03.174\nSince their discovery,\n\n00:05:03.198 --> 00:05:06.598\nit's been the animals that have received\nthe majority of the study\n\n00:05:07.158 --> 00:05:09.718\nlike this black horse\nfrom Cullalvera in Spain,\n\n00:05:10.358 --> 00:05:13.638\nor this unusual purple bison\nfrom La Pasiega.\n\n00:05:14.838 --> 00:05:20.214\nBut for me, it was the abstract shapes,\nwhat we call geometric signs,\n\n00:05:20.238 --> 00:05:21.838\nthat drew me to study the art.\n\n00:05:23.198 --> 00:05:25.494\nThe funny this is that at most sites\n\n00:05:25.518 --> 00:05:30.014\nthe geometric signs far outnumber\nthe animal and human images.\n\n00:05:30.038 --> 00:05:33.214\nBut when I started on this back in 2007,\n\n00:05:33.238 --> 00:05:37.214\nthere wasn't even a definitive list\nof how many shapes there were,\n\n00:05:37.238 --> 00:05:38.574\nnor was there a strong sense\n\n00:05:38.598 --> 00:05:41.478\nof whether the same ones\nappeared across space or time.\n\n00:05:44.078 --> 00:05:47.174\nBefore I could even\nget started on my questions,\n\n00:05:47.198 --> 00:05:49.294\nmy first step was to compile a database\n\n00:05:49.318 --> 00:05:53.214\nof all known geometric signs\nfrom all of the rock art sites.\n\n00:05:53.238 --> 00:05:56.814\nThe problem was that while they were\nwell documented at some sites,\n\n00:05:56.838 --> 00:05:59.134\nusually the ones\nwith the very nice animals,\n\n00:05:59.158 --> 00:06:02.814\nthere was also a large number of them\nwhere it was very vague --\n\n00:06:02.838 --> 00:06:05.094\nthere wasn't a lot\nof description or detail.\n\n00:06:05.118 --> 00:06:08.454\nSome of them hadn't been visited\nin half a century or more.\n\n00:06:08.478 --> 00:06:11.894\nThese were the ones\nthat I targeted for my field work.\n\n00:06:11.918 --> 00:06:13.774\nOver the course of two years,\n\n00:06:13.798 --> 00:06:19.014\nmy faithful husband Dylan and I\neach spent over 300 hours underground,\n\n00:06:19.038 --> 00:06:23.014\nhiking, crawling and wriggling\naround 52 sites\n\n00:06:23.038 --> 00:06:25.974\nin France, Spain, Portugal and Sicily.\n\n00:06:25.998 --> 00:06:27.854\nAnd it was totally worth it.\n\n00:06:27.878 --> 00:06:34.614\nWe found new, undocumented geometric signs\nat 75 percent of the sites we visited.\n\n00:06:34.638 --> 00:06:37.454\nThis is the level of accuracy\nI knew I was going to need\n\n00:06:37.478 --> 00:06:40.654\nif I wanted to start answering\nthose larger questions.\n\n00:06:40.678 --> 00:06:43.254\nSo let's get to those answers.\n\n00:06:43.278 --> 00:06:47.894\nBarring a handful of outliers,\nthere are only 32 geometric signs.\n\n00:06:47.918 --> 00:06:49.734\nOnly 32 signs\n\n00:06:49.758 --> 00:06:55.238\nacross a 30,000-year time span\nand the entire continent of Europe.\n\n00:06:55.678 --> 00:06:58.254\nThat is a very small number.\n\n00:06:58.278 --> 00:07:00.734\nNow, if these were random\ndoodles or decorations,\n\n00:07:00.758 --> 00:07:03.174\nwe would expect to see\na lot more variation,\n\n00:07:03.198 --> 00:07:05.614\nbut instead what we find\nare the same signs\n\n00:07:05.638 --> 00:07:08.078\nrepeating across both space and time.\n\n00:07:08.878 --> 00:07:12.774\nSome signs start out strong,\nbefore losing popularity and vanishing,\n\n00:07:12.798 --> 00:07:15.134\nwhile other signs are later inventions.\n\n00:07:15.158 --> 00:07:20.774\nBut 65 percent of those signs stayed\nin use during that entire time period --\n\n00:07:20.798 --> 00:07:25.094\nthings like lines, rectangles\ntriangles, ovals and circles\n\n00:07:25.118 --> 00:07:27.261\nlike we see here\nfrom the end of the Ice Age,\n\n00:07:27.285 --> 00:07:31.214\nat a 10,000-year-old site\nhigh in the Pyrenees Mountains.\n\n00:07:31.238 --> 00:07:34.454\nAnd while certain signs\nspan thousands of kilometers,\n\n00:07:34.478 --> 00:07:37.454\nother signs had much more\nrestricted distribution patterns,\n\n00:07:37.478 --> 00:07:39.894\nwith some being limited\nto a single territory,\n\n00:07:39.918 --> 00:07:42.094\nlike we see here\nwith these divided rectangles\n\n00:07:42.118 --> 00:07:44.334\nthat are only found in northern Spain,\n\n00:07:44.358 --> 00:07:46.414\nand which some researchers have speculated\n\n00:07:46.438 --> 00:07:48.758\ncould be some sort\nof family or clan signs.\n\n00:07:49.838 --> 00:07:51.214\nOn a side note,\n\n00:07:51.238 --> 00:07:54.654\nthere is surprising degree\nof similarity in the earliest rock art\n\n00:07:54.678 --> 00:07:59.254\nfound all the way from France and Spain\nto Indonesia and Australia.\n\n00:07:59.278 --> 00:08:03.574\nWith many of the same signs\nappearing in such far-flung places,\n\n00:08:03.598 --> 00:08:06.574\nespecially in that 30,000\nto 40,000-year range,\n\n00:08:06.598 --> 00:08:09.454\nit's starting to seem increasingly likely\n\n00:08:09.478 --> 00:08:14.334\nthat this invention actually traces back\nto a common point of origin in Africa.\n\n00:08:14.358 --> 00:08:16.974\nBut that I'm afraid,\nis a subject for a future talk.\n\n00:08:16.998 --> 00:08:18.814\nSo back to the matter at hand.\n\n00:08:18.838 --> 00:08:22.814\nThere could be no doubt that these signs\nwere meaningful to their creators,\n\n00:08:22.838 --> 00:08:25.654\nlike these 25,000-year-old\nbas-relief sculptures\n\n00:08:25.678 --> 00:08:28.294\nfrom La Roque de Venasque in France.\n\n00:08:28.318 --> 00:08:32.718\nWe might not know what they meant,\nbut the people of the time certainly did.\n\n00:08:33.718 --> 00:08:39.774\nThe repetition of the same signs,\nfor so long, and at so many sites\n\n00:08:39.798 --> 00:08:43.278\ntells us that the artists\nwere making intentional choices.\n\n00:08:43.758 --> 00:08:46.134\nIf we're talking about geometric shapes,\n\n00:08:46.158 --> 00:08:50.894\nwith specific, culturally recognized,\nagreed-upon meanings,\n\n00:08:50.918 --> 00:08:52.574\nthan we could very well be looking\n\n00:08:52.598 --> 00:08:57.134\nat one of the oldest systems\nof graphic communication in the world.\n\n00:08:57.158 --> 00:08:59.054\nI'm not talking about writing yet.\n\n00:08:59.078 --> 00:09:01.414\nThere's just not enough\ncharacters at this point\n\n00:09:01.438 --> 00:09:04.294\nto have represented all of the words\nin the spoken language,\n\n00:09:04.318 --> 00:09:07.134\nsomething which is a requirement\nfor a full writing system.\n\n00:09:07.158 --> 00:09:09.534\nNor do we see the signs\nrepeating regularly enough\n\n00:09:09.558 --> 00:09:12.214\nto suggest that they were\nsome sort of alphabet.\n\n00:09:12.238 --> 00:09:15.054\nBut what we do have\nare some intriguing one-offs,\n\n00:09:15.078 --> 00:09:19.654\nlike this panel from La Pasiega in Spain,\nknown as \"The Inscription,\"\n\n00:09:19.678 --> 00:09:22.214\nwith its symmetrical markings on the left,\n\n00:09:22.238 --> 00:09:25.454\npossible stylized representations\nof hands in the middle,\n\n00:09:25.478 --> 00:09:27.798\nand what looks a bit\nlike a bracket on the right.\n\n00:09:29.038 --> 00:09:31.894\nThe oldest systems of graphic\ncommunication in the world --\n\n00:09:31.918 --> 00:09:36.854\nSumerian cuneiform, Egyptian hieroglyphs,\nthe earliest Chinese script,\n\n00:09:36.878 --> 00:09:40.454\nall emerged between 4,000\nand 5,000 years ago,\n\n00:09:40.478 --> 00:09:43.614\nwith each coming into existence\nfrom an earlier protosystem\n\n00:09:43.638 --> 00:09:47.174\nmade up of counting marks\nand pictographic representations,\n\n00:09:47.198 --> 00:09:49.574\nwhere the meaning\nand the image were the same.\n\n00:09:49.598 --> 00:09:53.814\nSo a picture of a bird would really\nhave represented that animal.\n\n00:09:53.838 --> 00:09:58.574\nIt's only later that we start to see\nthese pictographs become more stylized,\n\n00:09:58.598 --> 00:10:00.934\nuntil they almost become unrecognizable\n\n00:10:00.958 --> 00:10:03.974\nand that we also start to see\nmore symbols being invented\n\n00:10:03.998 --> 00:10:06.894\nto represent all those other\nmissing words in language --\n\n00:10:06.918 --> 00:10:09.038\nthings like pronouns, adverbs, adjectives.\n\n00:10:10.118 --> 00:10:11.654\nSo knowing all this,\n\n00:10:11.678 --> 00:10:15.534\nit seems highly unlikely that\nthe geometric signs from Ice Age Europe\n\n00:10:15.558 --> 00:10:18.254\nwere truly abstract written characters.\n\n00:10:18.278 --> 00:10:20.494\nInstead, what's much more likely\n\n00:10:20.518 --> 00:10:24.494\nis that these early artists\nwere also making counting marks,\n\n00:10:24.518 --> 00:10:28.534\nmaybe like this row of lines\nfrom Riparo di Za Minic in Sicily,\n\n00:10:28.558 --> 00:10:31.174\nas well as creating\nstylized representations\n\n00:10:31.198 --> 00:10:33.694\nof things from the world around them.\n\n00:10:33.718 --> 00:10:36.334\nCould some of the signs\nbe weaponry or housing?\n\n00:10:36.358 --> 00:10:40.494\nOr what about celestial objects\nlike star constellations?\n\n00:10:40.518 --> 00:10:45.134\nOr maybe even rivers, mountains,\ntrees -- landscape features,\n\n00:10:45.158 --> 00:10:49.534\npossibly like this black penniform\nsurrounded by strange bell-shaped signs\n\n00:10:49.558 --> 00:10:52.134\nfrom the site of El Castillo in Spain.\n\n00:10:52.158 --> 00:10:55.454\nThe term penniform\nmeans \"feather-shaped\" in Latin,\n\n00:10:55.478 --> 00:10:59.318\nbut could this actually be\na depiction of a plant or a tree?\n\n00:10:59.678 --> 00:11:02.654\nSome researchers have begun\nto ask these questions\n\n00:11:02.678 --> 00:11:05.574\nabout certain signs at specific sites,\n\n00:11:05.598 --> 00:11:10.494\nbut I believe the time has come\nto revisit this category as a whole.\n\n00:11:10.518 --> 00:11:12.254\nThe irony in all of this, of course,\n\n00:11:12.278 --> 00:11:16.574\nis that having just carefully classified\nall of the signs into a single category,\n\n00:11:16.598 --> 00:11:20.094\nI have a feeling that my next step\nwill involve breaking it back apart\n\n00:11:20.118 --> 00:11:24.374\nas different types of imagery\nare identified and separated off.\n\n00:11:24.398 --> 00:11:25.614\nNow don't get me wrong,\n\n00:11:25.638 --> 00:11:28.254\nthe later creation\nof fully developed writing\n\n00:11:28.278 --> 00:11:30.894\nwas an impressive feat in its own right.\n\n00:11:30.918 --> 00:11:32.374\nBut it's important to remember\n\n00:11:32.398 --> 00:11:35.694\nthat those early writing systems\ndidn't come out of a vacuum.\n\n00:11:35.718 --> 00:11:37.694\nAnd that even 5,000 years ago,\n\n00:11:37.718 --> 00:11:41.054\npeople were already building\non something much older,\n\n00:11:41.078 --> 00:11:44.814\nwith its origins stretching back\ntens of thousands of years --\n\n00:11:44.838 --> 00:11:48.934\nto the geometric signs\nof Ice Age Europe and far beyond,\n\n00:11:48.958 --> 00:11:52.254\nto that point, deep\nin our collective history,\n\n00:11:52.278 --> 00:11:56.334\nwhen someone first came up with the idea\nof making a graphic mark,\n\n00:11:56.358 --> 00:11:59.294\nand forever changed the nature\nof how we communicate.\n\n00:11:59.318 --> 00:12:00.534\nThank you.\n\n00:12:00.558 --> 00:12:03.998\n(Applause)"}, {"title": "My year reading a book from every country in the world", "duration": "723", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/ann_morgan_my_year_reading_a_book_from_every_country_in_the_world", "transcript": "It's often said that you can tell a lot about a person by looking at what's on their bookshelves. What do my bookshelves say about me? Well, when I asked myself this question a few years ago, I made an alarming discovery. I'd always thought of myself as a fairly cultured, cosmopolitan sort of person. But my bookshelves told a rather different story. Pretty much all the titles on them were by British or North American authors, and there was almost nothing in translation. Discovering this massive, cultural blind spot in my reading came as quite a shock.And when I thought about it, it seemed like a real shame. I knew there had to be lots of amazing stories out there by writers working in languages other than English. And it seemed really sad to think that my reading habits meant I would probably never encounter them. So, I decided to prescribe myself an intensive course of global reading. 2012 was set to be a very international year for the UK; it was the year of the London Olympics. And so I decided to use it as my time frame to try to read a novel, short story collection or memoir from every country in the world. And so I did. And it was very exciting and I learned some remarkable things and made some wonderful connections that I want to share with you today.But it started with some practical problems. After I'd worked out which of the many different lists of countries in the world to use for my project, I ended up going with the list of UN-recognized nations, to which I added Taiwan, which gave me a total of 196 countries. And after I'd worked out how to fit reading and blogging about, roughly, four books a week around working five days a week,I then had to face up to the fact that I might even not be able to get books in English from every country. Only around 4.5 percent of the literary works published each year in the UK are translations, and the figures are similar for much of the English-speaking world. Although, the proportion of translated books published in many other countries is a lot higher. 4.5 percent is tiny enough to start with, but what that figure doesn't tell you is that many of those books will come from countries with strong publishing networks and lots of industry professionals primed to go out and sell those titles to English-language publishers. So, for example, although well over 100 books are translated from French and published in the UK each year, most of them will come from countries like France or Switzerland. French-speaking Africa, on the other hand, will rarely ever get a look-in.The upshot is that there are actually quite a lot of nations that may have little or even no commercially available literature in English. Their books remain invisible to readers of the world's most published language. But when it came to reading the world, the biggest challenge of all for me was that fact that I didn't know where to start. Having spent my life reading almost exclusively British and North American books, I had no idea how to go about sourcing and finding stories and choosing them from much of the rest of the world. I couldn't tell you how to source a story from Swaziland. I wouldn't know a good novel from Namibia. There was no hiding it \u2014 I was a clueless literary xenophobe. So how on earth was I going to read the world?I was going to have to ask for help. So in October 2011, I registered my blog, ayearofreadingtheworld.com, and I posted a short appeal online. I explained who I was, how narrow my reading had been, and I asked anyone who cared to to leave a message suggesting what I might read from other parts of the planet. Now, I had no idea whether anyone would be interested, but within a few hours of me posting that appeal online, people started to get in touch. At first, it was friends and colleagues. Then it was friends of friends. And pretty soon, it was strangers.Four days after I put that appeal online, I got a message from a woman called Rafidah in Kuala Lumpur. She said she loved the sound of my project, could she go to her local English-language bookshop and choose my Malaysian book and post it to me? I accepted enthusiastically, and a few weeks later, a package arrived containing not one, but two books \u2014 Rafidah's choice from Malaysia, and a book from Singapore that she had also picked out for me. Now, at the time, I was amazed that a stranger more than 6,000 miles away would go to such lengths to help someone she would probably never meet.But Rafidah's kindness proved to be the pattern for that year. Time and again, people went out of their way to help me. Some took on research on my behalf, and others made detours on holidays and business trips to go to bookshops for me. It turns out, if you want to read the world, if you want to encounter it with an open mind, the world will help you. When it came to countries with little or no commercially available literature in English, people went further still.Books often came from surprising sources. My Panamanian read, for example, came through a conversation I had with the Panama Canal on Twitter. Yes, the Panama Canal has a Twitter account. And when I tweeted at it about my project, it suggested that I might like to try and get hold of the work of the Panamanian author Juan David Morgan. I found Morgan's website and I sent him a message, asking if any of his Spanish-language novels had been translated into English. And he said that nothing had been published, but he did have an unpublished translation of his novel \"The Golden Horse.\" He emailed this to me, allowing me to become one of the first people ever to read that book in English.Morgan was by no means the only wordsmith to share his work with me in this way. From Sweden to Palau, writers and translators sent me self-published books and unpublished manuscripts of books that hadn't been picked up by Anglophone publishers or that were no longer available, giving me privileged glimpses of some remarkable imaginary worlds. I read, for example, about the Southern African king Ngungunhane, who led the resistance against the Portuguese in the 19th century; and about marriage rituals in a remote village on the shores of the Caspian sea in Turkmenistan. I met Kuwait's answer to Bridget Jones.(Laughter)And I read about an orgy in a tree in Angola.But perhaps the most amazing example of the lengths that people were prepared to go to to help me read the world, came towards the end of my quest, when I tried to get hold of a book from the tiny, Portuguese-speaking African island nation of S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Pr\u00edncipe. Now, having spent several months trying everything I could think of to find a book that had been translated into English from the nation, it seemed as though the only option left to me was to see if I could get something translated for me from scratch. Now, I was really dubious whether anyone was going to want to help with this, and give up their time for something like that. But, within a week of me putting a call out on Twitter and Facebook for Portuguese speakers, I had more people than I could involve in the project, including Margaret Jull Costa, a leader in her field, who has translated the work of Nobel Prize winner Jos\u00e9 Saramago. With my nine volunteers in place, I managed to find a book by a S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9an author that I could buy enough copies of online. Here's one of them. And I sent a copy out to each of my volunteers. They all took on a couple of short stories from this collection, stuck to their word, sent their translations back to me, and within six weeks, I had the entire book to read.In that case, as I found so often during my year of reading the world, my not knowing and being open about my limitations had become a big opportunity. When it came to S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Pr\u00edncipe, it was a chance not only to learn something new and discover a new collection of stories, but also to bring together a group of people and facilitate a joint creative endeavor. My weakness had become the project's strength.The books I read that year opened my eyes to many things. As those who enjoy reading will know, books have an extraordinary power to take you out of yourself and into someone else's mindset, so that, for a while at least, you look at the world through different eyes. That can be an uncomfortable experience, particularly if you're reading a book from a culture that may have quite different values to your own. But it can also be really enlightening. Wrestling with unfamiliar ideas can help clarify your own thinking. And it can also show up blind spots in the way you might have been looking at the world.When I looked back at much of the English-language literature I'd grown up with, for example, I began to see how narrow a lot of it was, compared to the richness that the world has to offer. And as the pages turned, something else started to happen, too. Little by little, that long list of countries that I'd started the year with, changed from a rather dry, academic register of place names into living, breathing entities.Now, I don't want to suggest that it's at all possible to get a rounded picture of a country simply by reading one book. But cumulatively, the stories I read that year made me more alive than ever before to the richness, diversity and complexity of our remarkable planet. It was as though the world's stories and the people who'd gone to such lengths to help me read them had made it real to me. These days, when I look at my bookshelves or consider the works on my e-reader, they tell a rather different story. It's the story of the power books have to connect us across political, geographical, cultural, social, religious divides. It's the tale of the potential human beings have to work together.And, it's testament to the extraordinary times we live in, where, thanks to the Internet, it's easier than ever before for a stranger to share a story, a worldview, a book with someone she may never meet, on the other side of the planet. I hope it's a story I'm reading for many years to come. And I hope many more people will join me. If we all read more widely, there'd be more incentive for publishers to translate more books, and we would all be richer for that.Thank you.(Applause)", "id": 2382, "subtitle":

what's on their bookshelves.\n\n00:00:19.637 --> 00:00:21.624\nWhat do my bookshelves say about me?\n\n00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:26.044\nWell, when I asked myself\nthis question a few years ago,\n\n00:00:26.068 --> 00:00:28.369\nI made an alarming discovery.\n\n00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:32.093\nI'd always thought of myself\nas a fairly cultured,\n\n00:00:32.117 --> 00:00:34.542\ncosmopolitan sort of person.\n\n00:00:34.566 --> 00:00:37.662\nBut my bookshelves told\na rather different story.\n\n00:00:38.397 --> 00:00:40.049\nPretty much all the titles on them\n\n00:00:40.073 --> 00:00:42.932\nwere by British or North American authors,\n\n00:00:42.956 --> 00:00:45.492\nand there was almost\nnothing in translation.\n\n00:00:46.285 --> 00:00:50.135\nDiscovering this massive,\ncultural blind spot in my reading\n\n00:00:50.159 --> 00:00:51.960\ncame as quite a shock.\n\n00:00:51.984 --> 00:00:55.477\nAnd when I thought about it,\nit

00:01:11.259\nSo, I decided to prescribe myself\n\n00:01:11.283 --> 00:01:13.901\nan intensive course of global reading.\n\n00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:18.298\n2012 was set to be a very\ninternational year

00:01:27.171\nto try to read a novel,\nshort story collection\n\n00:01:27.195 --> 00:01:31.512\nor memoir from every country in the world.\n\n00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:34.062\nAnd so I did.\n\n00:01:34.086 --> 00:01:35.713\nAnd it was very exciting\n\n00:01:35.737 --> 00:01:37.633\nand I learned some remarkable things\n\n00:01:37.657 --> 00:01:39.772\nand made some wonderful

00:07:22.091\nI met Kuwait's answer to Bridget Jones.\n\n00:07:22.408 --> 00:07:24.408\n(Laughter)\n\n00:07:25.259 --> 00:07:28.825\nAnd I read about an orgy\nin a tree in Angola.\n\n00:07:32.828 --> 00:07:34.980\nBut perhaps the most amazing example\n\n00:07:35.004 --> 00:07:37.408\nof the lengths that people\nwere prepared to go to\n\n00:07:37.432 --> 00:07:39.059\nto help me read the world,\n\n00:07:39.083 --> 00:07:41.532\ncame towards the end of my quest,\n\n00:07:41.556 --> 00:07:45.390\nwhen I tried to get hold of a book\nfrom the tiny, Portuguese-speaking\n\n00:07:45.414 --> 00:07:48.681\nAfrican island nation\nof S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Pr\u00edncipe.\n\n00:07:49.322 --> 00:07:52.971\nNow, having spent several months\ntrying everything I could think of to find\n\n00:07:52.995 --> 00:07:56.334\na book that had been translated\ninto English from the nation,\n\n00:07:56.358 --> 00:07:58.600\nit seemed as though\nthe only option left to me\n\n00:07:58.624 --> 00:08:01.831\nwas to see if I could get something\ntranslated for me from scratch.\n\n00:08:02.362 --> 00:08:03.863\nNow, I was really dubious\n\n00:08:03.887 --> 00:08:06.283\nwhether anyone was going\nto want to help with this,\n\n00:08:06.307 --> 00:08:08.806\nand give up their time\nfor something like that.\n\n00:08:09.483 --> 00:08:13.746\nBut, within a week of me putting\na call out on Twitter and Facebook\n\n00:08:13.770 --> 00:08:15.724\nfor Portuguese speakers,\n\n00:08:15.748 --> 00:08:19.319\nI had more people than I could\ninvolve in the project,\n\n00:08:19.343 --> 00:08:23.701\nincluding Margaret Jull Costa,\na leader in her field,\n\n00:08:23.725 --> 00:08:29.026\nwho has translated the work\nof Nobel Prize winner Jos\u00e9 Saramago.\n\n00:08:30.401 --> 00:08:32.336\nWith my nine volunteers in place,\n\n00:08:32.360 --> 00:08:34.948\nI managed to find a book\nby a S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9an author\n\n00:08:34.972 --> 00:08:37.482\nthat I could buy enough copies of online.\n\n00:08:37.506 --> 00:08:38.660\nHere's one of them.\n\n00:08:39.226 --> 00:08:42.790\nAnd I sent a copy out\nto each of my volunteers.\n\n00:08:42.814 --> 00:08:45.988\nThey all took on a couple\nof short stories from this collection,\n\n00:08:46.012 --> 00:08:49.639\nstuck to their word, sent\ntheir translations back to me,\n\n00:08:49.663 --> 00:08:53.452\nand within six weeks,\nI had the entire book to read.\n\n00:08:54.380 --> 00:08:58.842\nIn that case, as I found so often\nduring my year of reading the world,\n\n00:08:58.866 --> 00:09:02.951\nmy not knowing and being open\nabout my limitations\n\n00:09:02.975 --> 00:09:05.116\nhad become a big opportunity.\n\n00:09:05.893 --> 00:09:08.080\nWhen it came to S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Pr\u00edncipe,\n\n00:09:08.104 --> 00:09:11.450\nit was a chance not only\nto learn something new\n\n00:09:11.474 --> 00:09:14.149\nand discover a new collection of stories,\n\n00:09:14.173 --> 00:09:17.119\nbut also to bring together\na group of people\n\n00:09:17.143 --> 00:09:20.372\nand facilitate a joint creative endeavor.\n\n00:09:20.859 --> 00:09:24.759\nMy weakness had become\nthe project's strength.\n\n00:09:25.887 --> 00:09:29.443\nThe books I read that year\nopened my eyes to many things.\n\n00:09:29.467 --> 00:09:31.654\nAs those who enjoy reading will know,\n\n00:09:31.678 --> 00:09:35.458\nbooks have an extraordinary power\nto take you out of yourself\n\n00:09:35.482 --> 00:09:37.626\nand into someone else's mindset,\n\n00:09:37.650 --> 00:09:39.492\nso that, for a while at least,\n\n00:09:39.516 --> 00:09:41.741\nyou look at the world\nthrough different eyes.\n\n00:09:42.348 --> 00:09:44.811\nThat can be an uncomfortable experience,\n\n00:09:44.835 --> 00:09:46.607\nparticularly if you're reading a book\n\n00:09:46.631 --> 00:09:50.055\nfrom a culture that may have quite\ndifferent values to your own.\n\n00:09:50.559 --> 00:09:52.708\nBut it can also be really enlightening.\n\n00:09:53.360 --> 00:09:57.274\nWrestling with unfamiliar ideas\ncan help clarify your own thinking.\n\n00:09:57.700 --> 00:09:59.867\nAnd it can also show up blind spots\n\n00:09:59.891 --> 00:10:02.533\nin the way you might have\nbeen looking at the world.\n\n00:10:03.030 --> 00:10:05.912\nWhen I looked back at much\nof the English-language literature\n\n00:10:05.936 --> 00:10:07.622\nI'd grown up with, for example,\n\n00:10:07.646 --> 00:10:10.683\nI began to see how narrow a lot of it was,\n\n00:10:10.707 --> 00:10:13.519\ncompared to the richness\nthat the world has to offer.\n\n00:10:14.844 --> 00:10:17.006\nAnd as the pages turned,\n\n00:10:17.030 --> 00:10:19.496\nsomething else started to happen, too.\n\n00:10:20.108 --> 00:10:21.259\nLittle by little,\n\n00:10:21.283 --> 00:10:25.568\nthat long list of countries that\nI'd started the year with, changed\n\n00:10:25.592 --> 00:10:29.951\nfrom a rather dry, academic\nregister of place names\n\n00:10:29.975 --> 00:10:32.656\ninto living, breathing entities.\n\n00:10:33.433 --> 00:10:36.156\nNow, I don't want to suggest\nthat it's at all possible\n\n00:10:36.180 --> 00:10:40.386\nto get a rounded picture of a country\nsimply by reading one book.\n\n00:10:40.968 --> 00:10:44.557\nBut cumulatively, the stories\nI read that year\n\n00:10:44.581 --> 00:10:47.641\nmade me more alive than ever before\n\n00:10:47.665 --> 00:10:53.739\nto the richness, diversity and complexity\nof our remarkable planet.\n\n00:10:54.612 --> 00:10:56.605\nIt was as though the world's stories\n\n00:10:56.629 --> 00:11:00.529\nand the people who'd gone\nto such lengths to help me read them\n\n00:11:00.553 --> 00:11:02.458\nhad made it real to me.\n\n00:11:04.044 --> 00:11:06.579\nThese days, when I look at my bookshelves\n\n00:11:06.603 --> 00:11:09.728\nor consider the works on my e-reader,\n\n00:11:09.752 --> 00:11:11.867\nthey tell a rather different story.\n\n00:11:12.607 --> 00:11:15.953\nIt's the story of the power\nbooks have to connect us\n\n00:11:15.977 --> 00:11:20.722\nacross political, geographical,\ncultural, social, religious divides.\n\n00:11:21.380 --> 00:11:25.522\nIt's the tale of the potential\nhuman beings have to work together.\n\n00:11:26.278 --> 00:11:27.620\nAnd, it's testament\n\n00:11:27.644 --> 00:11:32.267\nto the extraordinary times we live\nin, where, thanks to the Internet,\n\n00:11:32.291 --> 00:11:34.208\nit's easier than ever before\n\n00:11:34.232 --> 00:11:38.661\nfor a stranger to share a story,\na worldview, a book\n\n00:11:38.685 --> 00:11:42.478\nwith someone she may never meet,\non the other side of the planet.\n\n00:11:43.553 --> 00:11:46.651\nI hope it's a story I'm reading\nfor many years to come.\n\n00:11:47.032 --> 00:11:49.881\nAnd I hope many more people will join me.\n\n00:11:49.905 --> 00:11:52.519\nIf we all read more widely,\nthere'd be more incentive\n\n00:11:52.543 --> 00:11:55.090\nfor publishers to translate more books,\n\n00:11:55.114 --> 00:11:57.053\nand we would all be richer for that.\n\n00:11:57.671 --> 00:11:58.828\nThank you.\n\n00:11:58.852 --> 00:12:02.586\n(Applause)"}, {"title": "Why the best hire might not have the perfect resume", "duration": "631", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/regina_hartley_why_the_best_hire_might_not_have_the_perfect_resume", "transcript": "Your company launches a search for an open position. The applications start rolling in, and the qualified candidates are identified. Now the choosing begins. Person A: Ivy League, 4.0, flawless resume, great recommendations. All the right stuff. Person B: state school, fair amount of job hopping, and odd jobs like cashier and singing waitress. But remember \u2014 both are qualified. So I ask you: who are you going to pick?My colleagues and I created very official terms to describe two distinct categories of candidates. We call A \"the Silver Spoon,\" the one who clearly had advantages and was destined for success. And we call B \"the Scrapper,\" the one who had to fight against tremendous odds to get to the same point. You just heard a human resources director refer to people as Silver Spoons and Scrappers \u2014(Laughter)which is not exactly politically correct and sounds a bit judgmental. But before my human resources certification gets revoked \u2014(Laughter)let me explain.A resume tells a story. And over the years, I've learned something about people whose experiences read like a patchwork quilt, that makes me stop and fully consider them before tossing their resumes away. A series of odd jobs may indicate inconsistency, lack of focus, unpredictability. Or it may signal a committed struggle against obstacles. At the very least, the Scrapper deserves an interview.To be clear, I don't hold anything against the Silver Spoon; getting into and graduating from an elite university takes a lot of hard work and sacrifice. But if your whole life has been engineered toward success, how will you handle the tough times? One person I hired felt that because he attended an elite university, there were certain assignments that were beneath him, like temporarily doing manual labor to better understand an operation. Eventually, he quit. But on the flip side, what happens when your whole life is destined for failure and you actually succeed?I want to urge you to interview the Scrapper. I know a lot about this because I am a Scrapper. Before I was born, my father was diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia, and he couldn't hold a job in spite of his brilliance. Our lives were one part \"Cuckoo's Nest,\" one part \"Awakenings\" and one part \"A Beautiful Mind.\"(Laughter)I'm the fourth of five children raised by a single mother in a rough neighborhood in Brooklyn, New York. We never owned a home, a car, a washing machine, and for most of my childhood, we didn't even have a telephone. So I was highly motivated to understand the relationship between business success and Scrappers, because my life could easily have turned out very differently. As I met successful business people and read profiles of high-powered leaders, I noticed some commonality.Many of them had experienced early hardships, anywhere from poverty, abandonment, death of a parent while young, to learning disabilities, alcoholism and violence. The conventional thinking has been that trauma leads to distress, and there's been a lot of focus on the resulting dysfunction. But during studies of dysfunction, data revealed an unexpected insight: that even the worst circumstances can result in growth and transformation. A remarkable and counterintuitive phenomenon has been discovered, which scientists call Post Traumatic Growth.In one study designed to measure the effects of adversity on children at risk, among a subset of 698 children who experienced the most severe and extreme conditions, fully one-third grew up to lead healthy, successful and productive lives. In spite of everything and against tremendous odds, they succeeded. One-third.Take this resume. This guy's parents give him up for adoption. He never finishes college. He job-hops quite a bit, goes on a sojourn to India for a year, and to top it off, he has dyslexia. Would you hire this guy? His name is Steve Jobs.In a study of the world's most highly successful entrepreneurs, it turns out a disproportionate number have dyslexia. In the US, 35 percent of the entrepreneurs studied had dyslexia. What's remarkable \u2014 among those entrepreneurs who experience post traumatic growth, they now view their learning disability as a desirable difficulty which provided them an advantage because they became better listeners and paid greater attention to detail. They don't think they are who they are in spite of adversity, they know they are who they are because of adversity. They embrace their trauma and hardships as key elements of who they've become, and know that without those experiences, they might not have developed the muscle and grit required to become successful.One of my colleagues had his life completely upended as a result of the Chinese Cultural Revolution in 1966. At age 13, his parents were relocated to the countryside, the schools were closed and he was left alone in Beijing to fend for himself until 16, when he got a job in a clothing factory. But instead of accepting his fate, he made a resolution that he would continue his formal education. Eleven years later, when the political landscape changed, he heard about a highly selective university admissions test. He had three months to learn the entire curriculum of middle and high school. So, every day he came home from the factory, took a nap, studied until 4am, went back to work and repeated this cycle every day for three months. He did it, he succeeded. His commitment to his education was unwavering, and he never lost hope. Today, he holds a master's degree, and his daughters each have degrees from Cornell and Harvard.Scrappers are propelled by the belief that the only person you have full control over is yourself. When things don't turn out well, Scrappers ask, \"What can I do differently to create a better result?\" Scrappers have a sense of purpose that prevents them from giving up on themselves, kind of like if you've survived poverty, a crazy father and several muggings, you figure, \"Business challenges? \u2014(Laughter)Really? Piece of cake. I got this.\"(Laughter)And that reminds me \u2014 humor. Scrappers know that humor gets you through the tough times, and laughter helps you change your perspective.And finally, there are relationships. People who overcome adversity don't do it alone. Somewhere along the way, they find people who bring out the best in them and who are invested in their success. Having someone you can count on no matter what is essential to overcoming adversity. I was lucky. In my first job after college, I didn't have a car, so I carpooled across two bridges with a woman who was the president's assistant. She watched me work and encouraged me to focus on my future and not dwell on my past. Along the way I've met many people who've provided me brutally honest feedback, advice and mentorship. These people don't mind that I once worked as a singing waitress to help pay for college.(Laughter)I'll leave you with one final, valuable insight. Companies that are committed to diversity and inclusive practices tend to support Scrappers and outperform their peers. According to DiversityInc, a study of their top 50 companies for diversity outperformed the S&P 500 by 25 percent.So back to my original question. Who are you going to bet on: Silver Spoon or Scrapper? I say choose the underestimated contender, whose secret weapons are passion and purpose.Hire the Scrapper.(Applause)", "id": 2380, "subtitle":

neighborhood\nin Brooklyn, New York.\n\n00:03:35.264 --> 00:03:40.020\nWe never owned a home,\na car, a washing machine,\n\n00:03:40.044 --> 00:03:44.366\nand for most of my childhood,\nwe didn't even have a telephone.\n\n00:03:44.993 --> 00:03:46.419\nSo I was highly motivated\n\n00:03:46.443 --> 00:03:50.822\nto understand the relationship\nbetween business success and Scrappers,\n\n00:03:50.846 --> 00:03:55.627\nbecause my life could easily\nhave turned out very differently.\n\n00:03:56.556 --> 00:03:58.812\nAs I met successful business people\n\n00:03:58.836 --> 00:04:02.158\nand read profiles of high-powered leaders,\n\n00:04:02.182 --> 00:04:04.033\nI noticed some commonality.\n\n00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:08.576\nMany of them had experienced\nearly hardships,\n\n00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:12.169\nanywhere from poverty, abandonment,\n\n00:04:12.193 --> 00:04:14.399\ndeath of a parent while young,\n\n00:04:14.423 --> 00:04:18.312\nto learning disabilities,\nalcoholism and violence.\n\n00:04:18.893 --> 00:04:23.129\nThe conventional thinking has been\nthat trauma leads to distress,\n\n00:04:23.153 --> 00:04:26.592\nand there's been a lot of focus\non the resulting dysfunction.\n\n00:04:26.616 --> 00:04:32.093\nBut during studies of dysfunction,\ndata revealed an unexpected insight:\n\n00:04:32.117 --> 00:04:37.992\nthat even the worst circumstances\ncan result in growth and transformation.\n\n00:04:38.373 --> 00:04:42.205\nA remarkable and counterintuitive\nphenomenon has been discovered,\n\n00:04:42.229 --> 00:04:46.609\nwhich scientists call\nPost Traumatic Growth.\n\n00:04:47.452 --> 00:04:50.628\nIn one study designed to measure\nthe effects of adversity\n\n00:04:50.652 --> 00:04:52.610\non children at risk,\n\n00:04:52.634 --> 00:04:57.207\namong a subset of 698 children\n\n00:04:57.231 --> 00:05:01.516\nwho experienced the most severe\nand extreme conditions,\n\n00:05:01.540 --> 00:05:08.410\nfully one-third grew up to lead healthy,\nsuccessful and productive lives.\n\n00:05:08.434 --> 00:05:13.599\nIn spite of everything and against\ntremendous odds, they succeeded.\n\n00:05:13.623 --> 00:05:15.117\nOne-third.\n\n00:05:15.906 --> 00:05:17.583\nTake this resume.\n\n00:05:17.607 --> 00:05:20.717\nThis guy's parents\ngive him up for adoption.\n\n00:05:20.741 --> 00:05:22.813\nHe never finishes college.\n\n00:05:23.472 --> 00:05:25.606\nHe job-hops quite a bit,\n\n00:05:25.630 --> 00:05:28.735\ngoes on a sojourn to India for a year,\n\n00:05:28.759 --> 00:05:31.870\nand to top it off, he has dyslexia.\n\n00:05:32.388 --> 00:05:34.199\nWould you hire this guy?\n\n00:05:34.876 --> 00:05:36.941\nHis name is Steve Jobs.\n\n00:05:38.382 --> 00:05:42.360\nIn a study of the world's\nmost highly successful entrepreneurs,\n\n00:05:42.384 --> 00:05:46.253\nit turns out a disproportionate\nnumber have dyslexia.\n\n00:05:46.753 --> 00:05:48.147\nIn the US,\n\n00:05:48.171 --> 00:05:52.142\n35 percent of the entrepreneurs\nstudied had dyslexia.\n\n00:05:52.639 --> 00:05:56.663\nWhat's remarkable --\namong those entrepreneurs\n\n00:05:56.687 --> 00:05:59.694\nwho experience post traumatic growth,\n\n00:05:59.718 --> 00:06:02.997\nthey now view their learning disability\n\n00:06:03.021 --> 00:06:07.465\nas a desirable difficulty\nwhich provided them an advantage\n\n00:06:07.489 --> 00:06:12.491\nbecause they became better listeners\nand paid greater attention to detail.\n\n00:06:13.141 --> 00:06:18.228\nThey don't think they are who they are\nin spite of adversity,\n\n00:06:18.252 --> 00:06:22.591\nthey know they are who they are\nbecause of adversity.\n\n00:06:22.986 --> 00:06:25.340\nThey embrace their trauma and hardships\n\n00:06:25.364 --> 00:06:28.000\nas key elements of who they've become,\n\n00:06:28.024 --> 00:06:31.301\nand know that without those experiences,\n\n00:06:31.325 --> 00:06:34.731\nthey might not have developed\nthe muscle and grit required\n\n00:06:34.755 --> 00:06:36.303\nto become successful.\n\n00:06:37.992 --> 00:06:41.275\nOne of my colleagues\nhad his life completely upended\n\n00:06:41.299 --> 00:06:45.701\nas a result of the Chinese\nCultural Revolution in 1966.\n\n00:06:46.526 --> 00:06:51.687\nAt age 13, his parents were relocated\nto the countryside,\n\n00:06:51.711 --> 00:06:54.012\nthe schools were closed\n\n00:06:54.036 --> 00:06:59.262\nand he was left alone in Beijing\nto fend for himself until 16,\n\n00:06:59.286 --> 00:07:01.616\nwhen he got a job in a clothing factory.\n\n00:07:01.941 --> 00:07:04.223\nBut instead of accepting his fate,\n\n00:07:04.247 --> 00:07:08.426\nhe made a resolution that he would\ncontinue his formal education.\n\n00:07:09.610 --> 00:07:13.301\nEleven years later, when\nthe political landscape changed,\n\n00:07:13.325 --> 00:07:17.591\nhe heard about a highly selective\nuniversity admissions test.\n\n00:07:18.341 --> 00:07:22.221\nHe had three months to learn\nthe entire curriculum\n\n00:07:22.245 --> 00:07:23.856\nof middle and high school.\n\n00:07:24.563 --> 00:07:28.720\nSo, every day he came home\nfrom the factory,\n\n00:07:28.744 --> 00:07:33.433\ntook a nap, studied until 4am,\nwent back to work\n\n00:07:33.457 --> 00:07:37.320\nand repeated this cycle\nevery day for three months.\n\n00:07:38.352 --> 00:07:40.974\nHe did it, he succeeded.\n\n00:07:41.577 --> 00:07:46.657\nHis commitment to his education\nwas unwavering, and he never lost hope.\n\n00:07:47.239 --> 00:07:50.175\nToday, he holds a master's degree,\n\n00:07:50.199 --> 00:07:54.693\nand his daughters each have degrees\nfrom Cornell and Harvard.\n\n00:07:55.436 --> 00:07:58.113\nScrappers are propelled by the belief\n\n00:07:58.137 --> 00:08:02.618\nthat the only person you have\nfull control over is yourself.\n\n00:08:03.605 --> 00:08:05.601\nWhen things don't turn out well,\n\n00:08:05.625 --> 00:08:10.641\nScrappers ask, \"What can I do differently\nto create a better result?\"\n\n00:08:11.057 --> 00:08:12.992\nScrappers have a sense of purpose\n\n00:08:13.016 --> 00:08:16.122\nthat prevents them\nfrom giving up on themselves,\n\n00:08:16.146 --> 00:08:22.178\nkind of like if you've survived poverty,\na crazy father and several muggings,\n\n00:08:22.202 -->

It's 1974. There is the gallery somewhere in the world, and there is a young girl, age 23, standing in the middle of the space. In the front of her is a table. On the table there are 76 objects for pleasure and for pain. Some of the objects are a glass of water, a coat, a shoe, a rose. But also the knife, the razor blade, the hammer and the pistol with one bullet. There are instructions which say, \"I'm an object. You can use everything on the table on me. I'm taking all responsibility \u2014 even killing me. And the time is six hours.\"The beginning of this performance was easy. People would give me the glass of water to drink, they'd give me the rose. But very soon after, there was a man who took the scissors and cut my clothes, and then they took the thorns of the rose and stuck them in my stomach. Somebody took the razor blade and cut my neck and drank the blood, and I still have the scar. The women would tell the men what to do. And the men didn't rape me because it was just a normal opening, and it was all public, and they were with their wives. They carried me around and put me on the table, and put the knife between my legs. And somebody took the pistol and bullet and put it against my temple. And another person took the pistol and they started a fight.And after six hours were finished, I... started walking towards the public. I was a mess. I was half-naked, I was full of blood and tears were running down my face. And everybody escaped, they just ran away. They could not confront myself, with myself as a normal human being. And then \u2014 what happened is I went to the hotel, it was at two in the morning. And I looked at myself in the mirror, and I had a piece of gray hair. Alright \u2014 please take off your blindfolds.Welcome to the performance world. First of all, let's explain what the performance is. So many artists, so many different explanations, but my explanation for performance is very simple. Performance is a mental and physical construction that the performer makes in a specific time in a space in front of an audience and then energy dialogue happens. The audience and the performer make the piece together. And the difference between performance and theater is huge. In the theater, the knife is not a knife and the blood is just ketchup. In the performance, the blood is the material, and the razor blade or knife is the tool. It's all about being there in the real time, and you can't rehearse performance, because you can't do many of these types of things twice \u2014 ever. Which is very important, the performance is \u2014 you know, all human beings are always afraid of very simple things. We're afraid of suffering, we're afraid of pain, we're afraid of mortality. So what I'm doing \u2014 I'm staging these kinds of fears in front of the audience. I'm using your energy, and with this energy I can go and push my body as far as I can. And then I liberate myself from these fears. And I'm your mirror. If I can do this for myself, you can do it for you.After Belgrade, where I was born, I went to Amsterdam. And you know, I've been doing performances since the last 40 years. And here I met Ulay, and he was the person I actually fell in love with. And we made, for 12 years, performances together. You know the knife and the pistols and the bullets, I exchange into love and trust. So to do this kind work you have to trust the person completely because this arrow is pointing to my heart. So, heart beating and adrenaline is rushing and so on, is about trust, is about total trust to another human being.Our relationship was 12 years, and we worked on so many subjects, both male and female energy. And as every relationship comes to an end, ours went too. We didn't make phone calls like normal human beings do and say, you know, \"This is over.\" We walked the Great Wall of China to say goodbye. I started at the Yellow Sea, and he started from the Gobi Desert. We walked, each of us, three months, two and a half thousand kilometers. It was the mountains, it was difficult. It was climbing, it was ruins. It was, you know, going through the 12 Chinese provinces, this was before China was open in '87. And we succeeded to meet in the middle to say goodbye. And then our relationship stopped.And now, it completely changed how I see the public. And one very important piece I made in those days was \"Balkan Baroque.\" And this was the time of the Balkan Wars, and I wanted to create some very strong, charismatic image, something that could serve for any war at any time, because the Balkan Wars are now finished, but there's always some war, somewhere. So here I am washing two and a half thousand dead, big, bloody cow bones. You can't wash the blood, you never can wash shame off the wars. So I'm washing this six hours, six days, and wars are coming off these bones, and becoming possible \u2014 an unbearable smell. But then something stays in the memory.I want to show you the one who really changed my life, and this was the performance in MoMa, which I just recently made. This performance \u2014 when I said to the curator, \"I'm just going to sit at the chair, and there will be an empty chair at the front, and anybody from the public can come and sit as long as they want.\" The curator said to me, \"That's ridiculous, you know, this is New York, this chair will be empty, nobody has time to sit in front of you.\"(Laughter)But I sit for three months. And I sit everyday, eight hours \u2014 the opening of the museum \u2014 and 10 hours on Friday when the museum is open 10 hours, and I never move. And I removed the table and I'm still sitting, and this changed everything. This performance, maybe 10 or 15 years ago \u2014 nothing would have happened. But the need of people to actually experience something different, the public was not anymore the group \u2014 relation was one to one. I was watching these people, they would come and sit in front of me, but they would have to wait for hours and hours and hours to get to this position, and finally, they sit.And what happened? They are observed by the other people, they're photographed, they're filmed by the camera, they're observed by me and they have nowhere to escape except in themselves. And that makes a difference. There was so much pain and loneliness, there's so much incredible things when you look in somebody else's eyes, because in the gaze with that total stranger, that you never even say one word \u2014 everything happened. And I understood when I stood up from that chair after three months, I am not the same anymore. And I understood that I have a very strong mission, that I have to communicate this experience to everybody.And this is how, for me, was born the idea to have an institute of immaterial performing arts. Because thinking about immateriality, performance is time-based art. It's not like a painting. You have the painting on the wall, the next day it's there. Performance, if you are missing it, you only have the memory, or the story of somebody else telling you, but you actually missed the whole thing. So you have to be there. And in my point, if you talk about immaterial art, music is the highest \u2014 absolutely highest art of all, because it's the most immaterial. And then after this is performance, and then everything else. That's my subjective way.This institute is going to happen in Hudson, upstate New York, and we are trying to build with Rem Koolhaas, an idea. And it's very simple. If you want to get experience, you have to give me your time. You have to sign the contract before you enter the building, that you will spend there a full six hours, you have to give me your word of honor. It's something so old-fashioned, but if you don't respect your own word of honor and you leave before \u2014 that's not my problem. But it's six hours, the experience. And then after you finish, you get a certificate of accomplishment, so get home and frame it if you want.(Laughter)This is orientation hall. The public comes in, and the first thing you have to do is dress in lab coats. It's this importance of stepping from being just a viewer into experimenter. And then you go to the lockers and you put your watch, your iPhone, your iPod, your computer and everything digital, electronic. And you are getting free time for yourself for the first time. Because there is nothing wrong with technology, our approach to technology is wrong. We are losing the time we have for ourselves. This is an institute to actually give you back this time.So what you do here, first you start slow walking, you start slowing down. You're going back to simplicity. After slow walking, you're going to learn how to drink water \u2014 very simple, drinking water for maybe half an hour. After this, you're going to the magnet chamber, where you're going to create some magnet streams on your body. Then after this, you go to crystal chamber. After crystal chamber, you go to eye-gazing chamber, after eye-gazing chamber, you go to a chamber where you are lying down. So it's the three basic positions of the human body, sitting, standing and lying. And slow walking. And there is a sound chamber. And then after you've seen all of this, and prepared yourself mentally and physically, then you are ready to see something with a long duration, like in immaterial art. It can be music, it can be opera, it can be a theater piece, it can be film, it can be video dance. You go to the long duration chairs because now you are comfortable. In the long duration chairs, you're transported to the big place where you're going to see the work. And if you fall asleep, which is very possible because it's been a long day, you're going to be transported to the parking lot.(Laughter)And you know, sleeping is very important. In sleeping, you're still receiving art. So in the parking lot you stay for a certain amount of time, and then after this you just, you know, go back, you see more of the things you like to see or go home with your certificate.So this institute right now is virtual. Right now, I am just making my institute in Brazil, then it's going to be in Australia, then it's coming here, to Canada and everywhere. And this is to experience a kind of simple method, how you go back to simplicity in your own life. Counting rice will be another thing.(Laughter)You know, if you count rice you can make life, too. How to count rice for six hours? It's incredibly important. You know, you go through this whole range of being bored, being angry, being completely frustrated, not finishing the amount of rice you're counting. And then this unbelievable amount of peace you get when satisfying work is finished \u2014 or counting sand in the desert. Or having the sound-isolated situation \u2014 that you have headphones, that you don't hear anything, and you're just there together without sound, with the people experiencing silence, just the simple silence.We are always doing things we like in our life. And this is why you're not changing. You do things in life \u2014 it's just nothing happens if you always do things the same way. But my method is to do things I'm afraid of, the things I fear, the things I don't know, to go to territory that nobody's ever been.And then also to include the failure. I think failure is important because if you go, if you experiment, you can fail. If you don't go into that area and you don't fail, you are actually repeating yourself over and over again. And I think that human beings right now need a change, and the only change to be made is a personal level change. You have to make the change on yourself. Because the only way to change consciousness and to change the world around us, is to start with yourself. It's so easy to criticize how it's different, the things in the world and they're not right, and the governments are corrupted and there's hunger in the world and there's wars \u2014 the killing. But what we do on the personal level \u2014 what is our contribution to this whole thing?Can you turn to your neighbor, the one you don't know, and look at them for two full minutes in their eyes, right now?(Chatter)I'm asking two minutes of your time, that's so little. Breathe slowly, don't try to blink, don't be self-conscious. Be relaxed. And just look a complete stranger in your eyes, in his eyes.(Silence) Thank you for trusting me.(Applause)Chris Anderson: Thank you.

time.\n\n00:00:24.518 --> 00:00:28.518\nIt's 1974.\n\n00:00:29.918 --> 00:00:32.478\nThere is the gallery somewhere\n\n00:00:33.838 --> 00:00:35.558\nin the world,\n\n00:00:37.038 --> 00:00:40.334\nand there is a young girl, age 23,\n\n00:00:40.358 --> 00:00:42.878\nstanding in the middle of the space.\n\n00:00:44.717 --> 00:00:48.038\nIn the front of her is a table.\n\n00:00:48.958 --> 00:00:53.838\nOn the table there are 76 objects\n\n00:00:54.678 --> 00:00:57.398\nfor pleasure and for pain.\n\n00:00:58.478 --> 00:01:00.654\nSome of the objects are\n\n00:01:00.678 --> 00:01:06.478\na glass of water, a coat, a shoe, a rose.\n\n00:01:07.118 --> 00:01:12.598\nBut also the knife,\nthe razor blade, the hammer\n\n00:01:13.758 --> 00:01:16.197\nand the pistol with one bullet.\n\n00:01:18.198 --> 00:01:21.174\nThere are instructions which say,\n\n00:01:21.198 --> 00:01:22.934\n\"I'm an object.\n\n00:01:22.958 --> 00:01:26.294\nYou can use everything on the table on me.\n\n00:01:26.318 --> 00:01:30.398\nI'm taking all responsibility --\neven killing me.\n\n00:01:30.878 --> 00:01:33.478\nAnd the time is six hours.\"\n\n00:01:35.558 --> 00:01:39.358\nThe beginning of this\nperformance was easy.\n\n00:01:40.238 --> 00:01:43.814\nPeople would give me\nthe glass of water to drink,\n\n00:01:43.838 --> 00:01:45.478\nthey'd give me the rose.\n\n00:01:46.078 --> 00:01:48.854\nBut very soon after,\n\n00:01:48.878 --> 00:01:52.374\nthere was a man who took the scissors\nand cut my clothes,\n\n00:01:52.398 --> 00:01:56.398\nand then they took the thorns of the rose\nand stuck them in my stomach.\n\n00:01:56.878 --> 00:02:01.238\nSomebody took the razor blade\nand cut my neck and drank the blood,\n\n00:02:01.918 --> 00:02:03.638\nand I still have the scar.\n\n00:02:04.678 --> 00:02:07.238\nThe women would tell the men what to do.\n\n00:02:07.958 --> 00:02:12.774\nAnd the men didn't rape me\nbecause it was just a normal opening,\n\n00:02:12.798 --> 00:02:14.494\nand it was all public,\n\n00:02:14.518 --> 00:02:16.894\nand they were with their wives.\n\n00:02:16.918 --> 00:02:19.174\nThey carried me around\nand put me on the table,\n\n00:02:19.198 --> 00:02:21.094\nand put the knife between my legs.\n\n00:02:21.118 --> 00:02:24.758\nAnd somebody took the pistol and bullet\nand put it against my temple.\n\n00:02:25.518 --> 00:02:29.518\nAnd another person took the pistol\nand they started a fight.\n\n00:02:30.878 --> 00:02:33.614\nAnd after six hours were finished,\n\n00:02:33.638 --> 00:02:36.134\nI...\n\n00:02:36.158 --> 00:02:39.294\nstarted walking towards the public.\n\n00:02:39.318 --> 00:02:40.534\nI was a mess.\n\n00:02:40.558 --> 00:02:44.878\nI was half-naked, I was full of blood\nand tears were running down my face.\n\n00:02:45.998 --> 00:02:48.838\nAnd everybody escaped, they just ran away.\n\n00:02:49.238 --> 00:02:54.238\nThey could not confront myself,\nwith myself as a normal human being.\n\n00:02:54.718 --> 00:02:56.038\nAnd then --\n\n00:02:57.038 --> 00:02:58.518\nwhat happened\n\n00:02:59.198 --> 00:03:03.678\nis I went to the hotel,\nit was at two in the morning.\n\n00:03:05.038 --> 00:03:06.718\nAnd\n\n00:03:07.638 --> 00:03:09.838\nI looked at myself in the mirror,\n\n00:03:10.478 --> 00:03:14.278\nand I had a piece of gray hair.\n\n00:03:16.038 --> 00:03:17.398\nAlright --\n\n00:03:17.958 --> 00:03:19.998\nplease take off your blindfolds.\n\n00:03:22.718 --> 00:03:24.998\nWelcome to the performance world.\n\n00:03:25.478 --> 00:03:28.838\nFirst of all, let's explain\nwhat the performance is.\n\n00:03:29.798 --> 00:03:32.334\nSo many artists,\nso many different explanations,\n\n00:03:32.358 --> 00:03:35.118\nbut my explanation\nfor performance is very simple.\n\n00:03:35.598 --> 00:03:40.174\nPerformance is a mental\nand physical construction\n\n00:03:40.198 --> 00:03:43.014\nthat the performer makes\nin a specific time\n\n00:03:43.038 --> 00:03:46.334\nin a space in front of an audience\n\n00:03:46.358 --> 00:03:48.678\nand then energy dialogue happens.\n\n00:03:49.238 --> 00:03:52.758\nThe audience and the performer\nmake the piece together.\n\n00:03:53.558 --> 00:03:57.318\nAnd the difference between\nperformance and theater is huge.\n\n00:03:58.198 --> 00:04:01.654\nIn the theater, the knife is not a knife\n\n00:04:01.678 --> 00:04:03.598\nand the blood is just ketchup.\n\n00:04:03.998 --> 00:04:08.534\nIn the performance,\nthe blood is the material,\n\n00:04:08.558 --> 00:04:11.854\nand the razor blade or knife is the tool.\n\n00:04:11.878 --> 00:04:15.774\nIt's all about being there\nin the real time,\n\n00:04:15.798 --> 00:04:17.654\nand you can't rehearse performance,\n\n00:04:17.678 --> 00:04:21.998\nbecause you can't do many\nof these types of things twice -- ever.\n\n00:04:23.318 --> 00:04:25.814\nWhich is very important,\nthe performance is --\n\n00:04:25.838 --> 00:04:30.134\nyou know, all human beings\nare always afraid of very simple things.\n\n00:04:30.158 --> 00:04:33.534\nWe're afraid of suffering,\nwe're afraid of pain,\n\n00:04:33.558 --> 00:04:35.638\nwe're afraid of mortality.\n\n00:04:36.198 --> 00:04:37.454\nSo what I'm doing --\n\n00:04:37.478 --> 00:04:41.694\nI'm staging these kinds of fears\nin front of the audience.\n\n00:04:41.718 --> 00:04:43.894\nI'm using your energy,\n\n00:04:43.918 --> 00:04:49.694\nand with this energy I can go\nand push my body as far as I can.\n\n00:04:49.718 --> 00:04:53.294\nAnd then I liberate myself\nfrom these fears.\n\n00:04:53.318 --> 00:04:54.614\nAnd I'm your mirror.\n\n00:04:54.638 --> 00:04:57.918\nIf I can do this for myself,\nyou can do it for you.\n\n00:04:58.678 --> 00:05:00.734\nAfter Belgrade, where I was born,\n\n00:05:00.758 --> 00:05:03.038\nI went to Amsterdam.\n\n00:05:03.398 --> 00:05:06.014\nAnd you know, I've been doing performances\n\n00:05:06.038 --> 00:05:08.294\nsince the last 40 years.\n\n00:05:08.318 --> 00:05:09.894\nAnd here I met Ulay,\n\n00:05:09.918 --> 00:05:13.294\nand he was the person\nI actually fell in love with.\n\n00:05:13.318 --> 00:05:16.454\nAnd we made, for 12 years,\nperformances together.\n\n00:05:16.478 --> 00:05:19.734\nYou know the knife\nand the pistols and the bullets,\n\n00:05:19.758 --> 00:05:22.694\nI exchange into love and trust.\n\n00:05:22.718 --> 00:05:26.334\nSo to do this kind work\nyou have to trust the person completely\n\n00:05:26.358 --> 00:05:29.374\nbecause this arrow\nis pointing to my heart.\n\n00:05:29.398 --> 00:05:33.734\nSo, heart beating and adrenaline\nis rushing and so on,\n\n00:05:33.758 --> 00:05:38.278\nis about trust, is about total trust\nto another human being.\n\n00:05:39.278 --> 00:05:41.494\nOur relationship was 12 years,\n\n00:05:41.518 --> 00:05:45.374\nand we worked on so many subjects,\nboth male and female energy.\n\n00:05:45.398 --> 00:05:49.534\nAnd as every relationship\ncomes to an end, ours went too.\n\n00:05:49.558 --> 00:05:53.214\nWe didn't make phone calls\nlike normal human beings do\n\n00:05:53.238 --> 00:05:55.214\nand say, you know, \"This is over.\"\n\n00:05:55.238 --> 00:05:58.238\nWe walked the Great Wall\nof China to say goodbye.\n\n00:05:58.598 --> 00:06:02.678\nI started at the Yellow Sea,\nand he started from the Gobi Desert.\n\n00:06:03.158 --> 00:06:06.534\nWe walked, each of us, three months,\n\n00:06:06.558 --> 00:06:08.398\ntwo and a half thousand kilometers.\n\n00:06:08.758 --> 00:06:10.734\nIt was the mountains, it was difficult.\n\n00:06:10.758 --> 00:06:13.094\nIt was climbing, it was ruins.\n\n00:06:13.118 --> 00:06:16.214\nIt was, you know, going through\nthe 12 Chinese provinces,\n\n00:06:16.238 --> 00:06:20.054\nthis was before China was open in '87.\n\n00:06:20.078 --> 00:06:23.614\nAnd we succeeded to meet in the middle\n\n00:06:23.638 --> 00:06:25.118\nto say goodbye.\n\n00:06:26.278 --> 00:06:28.118\nAnd then our relationship stopped.\n\n00:06:28.518 --> 00:06:32.918\nAnd now, it completely changed\nhow I see the public.\n\n00:06:33.238 --> 00:06:36.374\nAnd one very important piece\nI made in those days\n\n00:06:36.398 --> 00:06:38.374\nwas \"Balkan Baroque.\"\n\n00:06:38.398 --> 00:06:41.094\nAnd this was the time of the Balkan Wars,\n\n00:06:41.118 --> 00:06:44.654\nand I wanted to create\nsome very strong, charismatic image,\n\n00:06:44.678 --> 00:06:47.974\nsomething that could serve\nfor any war at any time,\n\n00:06:47.998 --> 00:06:52.014\nbecause the Balkan Wars are now finished,\nbut there's always some war, somewhere.\n\n00:06:52.038 --> 00:06:54.014\nSo here I am washing\n\n00:06:54.038 --> 00:06:57.814\ntwo and a half thousand\ndead, big, bloody cow bones.\n\n00:06:57.838 --> 00:07:01.374\nYou can't wash the blood,\nyou never can wash shame off the wars.\n\n00:07:01.398 --> 00:07:05.974\nSo I'm washing this six hours, six days,\nand wars are coming off these bones,\n\n00:07:05.998 --> 00:07:09.238\nand becoming possible --\nan unbearable smell.\n\n00:07:09.598 --> 00:07:12.454\nBut then something stays in the memory.\n\n00:07:12.478 --> 00:07:15.214\nI want to show you the one\nwho really changed my life,\n\n00:07:15.238 --> 00:07:19.374\nand this was the performance in MoMa,\nwhich I just recently made.\n\n00:07:19.398 --> 00:07:22.734\nThis performance --\nwhen I said to the curator,\n\n00:07:22.758 --> 00:07:24.734\n\"I'm just going to sit at the chair,\n\n00:07:24.758 --> 00:07:27.294\nand there will be\nan empty chair at the front,\n\n00:07:27.318 --> 00:07:30.814\nand anybody from the public\ncan come and sit as long as they want.\"\n\n00:07:30.838 --> 00:07:32.054\nThe curator said to me,\n\n00:07:32.078 --> 00:07:34.734\n\"That's ridiculous, you know,\nthis is New York,\n\n00:07:34.758 --> 00:07:35.974\nthis chair will be empty,\n\n00:07:35.998 --> 00:07:37.903\nnobody has time to sit in front of you.\"\n\n00:07:37.927 --> 00:07:39.094\n(Laughter)\n\n00:07:39.118 --> 00:07:41.014\nBut I sit for three months.\n\n00:07:41.038 --> 00:07:42.974\nAnd I sit everyday, eight hours --\n\n00:07:42.998 --> 00:07:44.374\nthe opening of the museum --\n\n00:07:44.398 --> 00:07:47.294\nand 10 hours on Friday\nwhen the museum is open 10 hours,\n\n00:07:47.318 --> 00:07:48.492\nand I never move.\n\n00:07:48.516 --> 00:07:51.374\nAnd I removed the table\nand I'm still sitting,\n\n00:07:51.398 --> 00:07:53.518\nand this changed everything.\n\n00:07:53.918 --> 00:07:56.254\nThis performance,\nmaybe 10 or 15 years ago --\n\n00:07:56.278 --> 00:07:57.694\nnothing would have happened.\n\n00:07:57.718 --> 00:08:02.614\nBut the need of people to actually\nexperience something different,\n\n00:08:02.638 --> 00:08:04.734\nthe public was not anymore the group --\n\n00:08:04.758 --> 00:08:06.758\nrelation was one to one.\n\n00:08:07.118 --> 00:08:10.854\nI was watching these people,\nthey would come and sit in front of me,\n\n00:08:10.878 --> 00:08:13.574\nbut they would have to wait\nfor hours and hours and hours\n\n00:08:13.598 --> 00:08:14.756\nto get to this position,\n\n00:08:14.781 --> 00:08:16.334\nand finally, they sit.\n\n00:08:16.358 --> 00:08:17.918\nAnd what happened?\n\n00:08:18.398 --> 00:08:20.534\nThey are observed by the other people,\n\n00:08:20.558 --> 00:08:23.134\nthey're photographed,\nthey're filmed by the camera,\n\n00:08:23.158 --> 00:08:24.534\nthey're observed by me\n\n00:08:24.558 --> 00:08:27.718\nand they have nowhere to escape\nexcept in themselves.\n\n00:08:28.198 --> 00:08:29.774\nAnd that makes a difference.\n\n00:08:29.798 --> 00:08:31.614\nThere was so much pain and loneliness,\n\n00:08:31.638 --> 00:08:35.734\nthere's so much incredible things\nwhen you look in somebody else's eyes,\n\n00:08:35.758 --> 00:08:38.734\nbecause in the gaze\nwith that total stranger,\n\n00:08:38.758 --> 00:08:41.758\nthat you never even say one word --\neverything happened.\n\n00:08:42.158 --> 00:08:47.134\nAnd I understood when I stood up\nfrom that chair after three months,\n\n00:08:47.158 --> 00:08:48.733\nI am not the same anymore.\n\n00:08:48.757 --> 00:08:51.534\nAnd I understood\nthat I have a very strong mission,\n\n00:08:51.558 --> 00:08:54.814\nthat I have to communicate this experience\n\n00:08:54.838 --> 00:08:56.093\nto everybody.\n\n00:08:56.117 --> 00:08:58.934\nAnd this is how, for me, was born the idea\n\n00:08:58.958 --> 00:09:02.958\nto have an institute\nof immaterial performing arts.\n\n00:09:03.278 --> 00:09:06.174\nBecause thinking about immateriality,\n\n00:09:06.198 --> 00:09:07.654\nperformance is time-based art.\n\n00:09:07.678 --> 00:09:09.014\nIt's not like a painting.\n\n00:09:09.038 --> 00:09:11.814\nYou have the painting on the wall,\nthe next day it's there.\n\n00:09:11.838 --> 00:09:16.534\nPerformance, if you are missing it,\nyou only have the memory,\n\n00:09:16.558 --> 00:09:18.894\nor the story of somebody else telling you,\n\n00:09:18.918 --> 00:09:20.854\nbut you actually missed the whole thing.\n\n00:09:20.878 --> 00:09:22.094\nSo you have to be there.\n\n00:09:22.118 --> 00:09:25.014\nAnd in my point,\nif you talk about immaterial art,\n\n00:09:25.038 --> 00:09:28.414\nmusic is the highest --\nabsolutely highest art of all,\n\n00:09:28.438 --> 00:09:30.214\nbecause it's the most immaterial.\n\n00:09:30.238 --> 00:09:33.096\nAnd then after this is performance,\nand then everything else.\n\n00:09:33.120 --> 00:09:34.654\nThat's my subjective way.\n\n00:09:34.678 --> 00:09:38.574\nThis institute is going to happen\nin Hudson, upstate New York,\n\n00:09:38.598 --> 00:09:41.598\nand we are trying to build\nwith Rem Koolhaas, an idea.\n\n00:09:41.918 --> 00:09:43.174\nAnd it's very simple.\n\n00:09:43.198 --> 00:09:47.854\nIf you want to get experience,\nyou have to give me your time.\n\n00:09:47.878 --> 00:09:50.974\nYou have to sign the contract\nbefore you enter the building,\n\n00:09:50.998 --> 00:09:53.854\nthat you will spend there\na full six hours,\n\n00:09:53.878 --> 00:09:56.534\nyou have to give me your word of honor.\n\n00:09:56.558 --> 00:09:58.454\nIt's something so old-fashioned,\n\n00:09:58.478 --> 00:10:01.814\nbut if you don't respect your own\nword of honor and you leave before --\n\n00:10:01.838 --> 00:10:03.054\nthat's not my problem.\n\n00:10:03.078 --> 00:10:05.574\nBut it's six hours, the experience.\n\n00:10:05.598 --> 00:10:08.741\nAnd then after you finish,\nyou get a certificate of accomplishment,\n\n00:10:08.765 --> 00:10:10.814\nso get home and frame it if you want.\n\n00:10:10.838 --> 00:10:11.854\n(Laughter)\n\n00:10:11.878 --> 00:10:13.214\nThis is orientation hall.\n\n00:10:13.238 --> 00:10:17.734\nThe public comes in, and the first thing\nyou have to do is dress in lab coats.\n\n00:10:17.758 --> 00:10:18.974\nIt's this importance\n\n00:10:18.998 --> 00:10:23.214\nof stepping from being\njust a viewer into experimenter.\n\n00:10:23.238 --> 00:10:25.654\nAnd then you go to the lockers\n\n00:10:25.678 --> 00:10:28.974\nand you put your watch,\nyour iPhone, your iPod, your computer\n\n00:10:28.998 --> 00:10:31.294\nand everything digital, electronic.\n\n00:10:31.318 --> 00:10:35.654\nAnd you are getting free time\nfor yourself for the first time.\n\n00:10:35.678 --> 00:10:39.054\nBecause there is nothing\nwrong with technology,\n\n00:10:39.078 --> 00:10:41.414\nour approach to technology is wrong.\n\n00:10:41.438 --> 00:10:44.134\nWe are losing the time\nwe have for ourselves.\n\n00:10:44.158 --> 00:10:47.454\nThis is an institute\nto actually give you back this time.\n\n00:10:47.478 --> 00:10:48.734\nSo what you do here,\n\n00:10:48.758 --> 00:10:51.854\nfirst you start slow walking,\nyou start slowing down.\n\n00:10:51.878 --> 00:10:53.814\nYou're going back to simplicity.\n\n00:10:53.838 --> 00:10:57.454\nAfter slow walking, you're going\nto learn how to drink water --\n\n00:10:57.478 --> 00:11:01.118\nvery simple, drinking water\nfor maybe half an hour.\n\n00:11:01.598 --> 00:11:03.894\nAfter this, you're going to\nthe magnet chamber,\n\n00:11:03.918 --> 00:11:07.814\nwhere you're going to create\nsome magnet streams on your body.\n\n00:11:07.838 --> 00:11:10.294\nThen after this,\nyou go to crystal chamber.\n\n00:11:10.318 --> 00:11:13.094\nAfter crystal chamber,\nyou go to eye-gazing chamber,\n\n00:11:13.118 --> 00:11:17.214\nafter eye-gazing chamber, you go to\na chamber where you are lying down.\n\n00:11:17.238 --> 00:11:19.694\nSo it's the three basic positions\nof the human body,\n\n00:11:19.718 --> 00:11:21.054\nsitting, standing and lying.\n\n00:11:21.078 --> 00:11:22.614\nAnd slow walking.\n\n00:11:22.638 --> 00:11:24.454\nAnd there is a sound chamber.\n\n00:11:24.478 --> 00:11:26.814\nAnd then after you've seen all of this,\n\n00:11:26.838 --> 00:11:28.981\nand prepared yourself\nmentally and physically,\n\n00:11:29.005 --> 00:11:31.672\nthen you are ready to see\nsomething with a long duration,\n\n00:11:31.696 --> 00:11:34.054\nlike in immaterial art.\n\n00:11:34.078 --> 00:11:37.934\nIt can be music, it can be opera,\nit can be a theater piece,\n\n00:11:37.958 --> 00:11:40.854\nit can be film, it can be video dance.\n\n00:11:40.878 --> 00:11:44.694\nYou go to the long duration chairs\nbecause now you are comfortable.\n\n00:11:44.718 --> 00:11:46.094\nIn the long duration chairs,\n\n00:11:46.118 --> 00:11:49.814\nyou're transported to the big place\nwhere you're going to see the work.\n\n00:11:49.838 --> 00:11:51.054\nAnd if you fall asleep,\n\n00:11:51.078 --> 00:11:53.614\nwhich is very possible\nbecause it's been a long day,\n\n00:11:53.638 --> 00:11:56.094\nyou're going to be\ntransported to the parking lot.\n\n00:11:56.118 --> 00:11:57.734\n(Laughter)\n\n00:11:57.758 --> 00:12:00.574\nAnd you know, sleeping is very important.\n\n00:12:00.598 --> 00:12:03.374\nIn sleeping, you're still receiving art.\n\n00:12:03.398 --> 00:12:07.094\nSo in the parking lot you stay\nfor a certain amount of time,\n\n00:12:07.118 --> 00:12:10.374\nand then after this\nyou just, you know, go back,\n\n00:12:10.398 --> 00:12:12.734\nyou see more of the things you like to see\n\n00:12:12.758 --> 00:12:14.798\nor go home with your certificate.\n\n00:12:15.238 --> 00:12:18.654\nSo this institute right now is virtual.\n\n00:12:18.678 --> 00:12:21.534\nRight now, I am just\nmaking my institute in Brazil,\n\n00:12:21.558 --> 00:12:23.225\nthen it's going to be in Australia,\n\n00:12:23.249 --> 00:12:26.374\nthen it's coming here,\nto Canada and everywhere.\n\n00:12:26.398 --> 00:12:29.894\nAnd this is to experience\na kind of simple method,\n\n00:12:29.918 --> 00:12:32.814\nhow you go back to simplicity\nin your own life.\n\n00:12:32.838 --> 00:12:34.798\nCounting rice will be another thing.\n\n00:12:35.718 --> 00:12:37.614\n(Laughter)\n\n00:12:37.638 --> 00:12:40.134\nYou know, if you count rice\nyou can make life, too.\n\n00:12:40.158 --> 00:12:42.334\nHow to count rice for six hours?\n\n00:12:42.358 --> 00:12:44.054\nIt's incredibly important.\n\n00:12:44.078 --> 00:12:48.214\nYou know, you go through this whole range\nof being bored, being angry,\n\n00:12:48.238 --> 00:12:52.694\nbeing completely frustrated, not finishing\nthe amount of rice you're counting.\n\n00:12:52.718 --> 00:12:55.494\nAnd then this unbelievable\namount of peace you get\n\n00:12:55.518 --> 00:12:57.974\nwhen satisfying work is finished --\n\n00:12:57.998 --> 00:12:59.798\nor counting sand in the desert.\n\n00:13:00.558 --> 00:13:04.054\nOr having the sound-isolated situation --\n\n00:13:04.078 --> 00:13:06.654\nthat you have headphones,\nthat you don't hear anything,\n\n00:13:06.678 --> 00:13:09.374\nand you're just there\ntogether without sound,\n\n00:13:09.398 --> 00:13:14.254\nwith the people experiencing silence,\njust the simple silence.\n\n00:13:14.278 --> 00:13:18.494\nWe are always doing things\nwe like in our life.\n\n00:13:18.518 --> 00:13:20.774\nAnd this is why you're not changing.\n\n00:13:20.798 --> 00:13:22.254\nYou do things in life --\n\n00:13:22.278 --> 00:13:25.678\nit's just nothing happens\nif you always do things the same way.\n\n00:13:26.158 --> 00:13:31.254\nBut my method is to do things\nI'm afraid of, the things I fear,\n\n00:13:31.278 --> 00:13:32.774\nthe things I don't know,\n\n00:13:32.798 --> 00:13:35.654\nto go to territory\nthat nobody's ever been.\n\n00:13:35.678 --> 00:13:38.534\nAnd then also to include the failure.\n\n00:13:38.558 --> 00:13:40.294\nI think failure is important\n\n00:13:40.318 --> 00:13:44.054\nbecause if you go,\nif you experiment, you can fail.\n\n00:13:44.078 --> 00:13:46.734\nIf you don't go into that area\nand you don't fail,\n\n00:13:46.758 --> 00:13:49.758\nyou are actually repeating yourself\nover and over again.\n\n00:13:50.278 --> 00:13:54.094\nAnd I think that human beings\nright now need a change,\n\n00:13:54.118 --> 00:13:58.214\nand the only change to be made\nis a personal level change.\n\n00:13:58.238 --> 00:14:00.814\nYou have to make the change on yourself.\n\n00:14:00.838 --> 00:14:03.334\nBecause the only way\nto change consciousness\n\n00:14:03.358 --> 00:14:05.374\nand to change the world around us,\n\n00:14:05.398 --> 00:14:07.094\nis to start with yourself.\n\n00:14:07.118 --> 00:14:09.614\nIt's so easy to criticize\nhow it's different,\n\n00:14:09.638 --> 00:14:11.781\nthe things in the world\nand they're not right,\n\n00:14:11.805 --> 00:14:15.054\nand the governments are corrupted\nand there's hunger in the world\n\n00:14:15.078 --> 00:14:18.534\nand there's wars -- the killing.\n\n00:14:18.558 --> 00:14:21.134\nBut what we do on the personal level --\n\n00:14:21.158 --> 00:14:24.118\nwhat is our contribution\nto this whole thing?\n\n00:14:24.918 --> 00:14:28.014\nCan you turn to your neighbor,\nthe one you don't know,\n\n00:14:28.038 --> 00:14:32.158\nand look at them for two full minutes\nin their eyes, right now?\n\n00:14:33.798 --> 00:14:38.294\n(Chatter)\n\n00:14:38.318 --> 00:14:42.214\nI'm asking two minutes\nof your time, that's so little.\n\n00:14:42.238 --> 00:14:47.574\nBreathe slowly, don't try to blink,\ndon't be self-conscious.\n\n00:14:47.598 --> 00:14:49.214\nBe relaxed.\n\n00:14:49.238 --> 00:14:54.638\nAnd just look a complete\nstranger in your eyes, in his

Was it working in the sun? Was it working to provide food for a family or a community? Was it working days and nights trying to protect lives and property? Was it working alone or working on a project that wasn't guaranteed to succeed, but that might improve human health or save a life? Was it working to build something, create something, make a work of art? Was it work for which you were never sure you were fully understood or appreciated? The people in our communities who do these jobs deserve our attention, our love and our deepest support.But people aren't the only ones in our communities who do these difficult jobs. These jobs are also done by the plants, the animals and the ecosystems on our planet, including the ecosystems I study: the tropical coral reefs. Coral reefs are farmers. They provide food, income and food security for hundreds of millions of people around the world. Coral reefs are security guards. The structures that they build protect our shorelines from storm surge and waves, and the biological systems that they house filter the water and make it safer for us to work and play. Coral reefs are chemists. The molecules that we're discovering on coral reefs are increasingly important in the search for new antibiotics and new cancer drugs. And coral reefs are artists. The structures that they build are some of the most beautiful things on planet Earth. And this beauty is the foundation of the tourism industry in many countries with few or little other natural resources.So for all of these reasons, all of these ecosystem services, economists estimate the value of the world's coral reefs in the hundreds of billions of dollars per year. And yet despite all that hard work being done for us and all that wealth that we gain, we have done almost everything we possibly could to destroy that. We have taken the fish out of the oceans and we have added in fertilizer, sewage, diseases, oil, pollution, sediments. We have trampled the reefs physically with our boats, our fins, our bulldozers, and we have changed the chemistry of the entire sea, warmed the waters and made storms worse. And these would all be bad on their own, but these threats magnify each other and compound one another and make each other worse.I'll give you an example. Where I live and work, in Cura\u00e7ao, a tropical storm went by a few years ago. And on the eastern end of the island, where the reefs are intact and thriving, you could barely tell a tropical storm had passed. But in town, where corals had died from overfishing, from pollution, the tropical storm picked up the dead corals and used them as bludgeons to kill the corals that were left. This is a coral that I studied during my PhD \u2014 I got to know it quite well. And after this storm took off half of its tissue, it became infested with algae, the algae overgrew the tissue and that coral died. This magnification of threats, this compounding of factors is what Jeremy Jackson describes as the \"slippery slope to slime.\" It's hardly even a metaphor because many of our reefs now are literally bacteria and algae and slime.Now, this is the part of the talk where you may expect me to launch into my plea for us to all save the coral reefs. But I have a confession to make: that phrase drives me nuts. Whether I see it in a tweet, in a news headline or the glossy pages of a conservation brochure, that phrase bothers me, because we as conservationists have been sounding the alarms about the death of coral reefs for decades. And yet, almost everyone I meet, no matter how educated, is not sure what a coral is or where they come from. How would we get someone to care about the world's coral reefs when it's an abstract thing they can barely understand? If they don't understand what a coral is or where it comes from, or how funny or interesting or beautiful it is, why would we expect them to care about saving them?So let's change that. What is a coral and where does it come from? Corals are born in a number of different ways, but most often by mass spawning: all of the individuals of a single species on one night a year, releasing all the eggs they've made that year into the water column, packaged into bundles with sperm cells. And those bundles go to the surface of the ocean and break apart. And hopefully \u2014 hopefully \u2014 at the surface of the ocean, they meet the eggs and sperm from other corals. And that is why you need lots of corals on a coral reef \u2014 so that all of their eggs can meet their match at the surface. When they're fertilized, they do what any other animal egg does: divides in half again and again and again. Taking these photos under the microscope every year is one of my favorite and most magical moments of the year. At the end of all this cell division, they turn into a swimming larva \u2014 a little tiny blob of fat the size of a poppy seed, but with all of the sensory systems that we have. They can sense color and light, textures, chemicals, pH. They can even feel pressure waves; they can hear sound. And they use those talents to search the bottom of the reef for a place to attach and live the rest of their lives.So imagine finding a place where you would live the rest of your life when you were just two days old. They attach in the place they find most suitable, they build a skeleton underneath themselves, they build a mouth and tentacles, and then they begin the difficult work of building the world's coral reefs. One coral polyp will divide itself again and again and again, leaving a limestone skeleton underneath itself and growing up toward the sun. Given hundreds of years and many species, what you get is a massive limestone structure that can be seen from space in many cases, covered by a thin skin of these hardworking animals. Now, there are only a few hundred species of corals on the planet, maybe 1,000. But these systems house millions and millions of other species, and that diversity is what stabilizes the systems, and it's where we're finding our new medicines. It's how we find new sources of food. I'm lucky enough to work on the island of Cura\u00e7ao, where we still have reefs that look like this. But, indeed, much of the Caribbean and much of our world is much more like this.Scientists have studied in increasing detail the loss of the world's coral reefs, and they have documented with increasing certainty the causes. But in my research, I'm not interested in looking backward. My colleagues and I in Cura\u00e7ao are interested in looking forward at what might be. And we have the tiniest reason to be optimistic. Because even in some of these reefs that we probably could have written off long ago, we sometimes see baby corals arrive and survive anyway. And we're starting to think that baby corals may have the ability to adjust to some of the conditions that the adults couldn't. They may be able to adjust ever so slightly more readily to this human planet. So in the research I do with my colleagues in Cura\u00e7ao, we try to figure out what a baby coral needs in that critical early stage, what it's looking for and how we can try to help it through that process. I'm going to show you three examples of the work we've done to try to answer those questions.A few years ago we took a 3D printer and we made coral choice surveys \u2014 different colors and different textures, and we simply asked the coral where they preferred to settle. And we found that corals, even without the biology involved, still prefer white and pink, the colors of a healthy reef. And they prefer crevices and grooves and holes, where they will be safe from being trampled or eaten by a predator. So we can use this knowledge, we can go back and say we need to restore those factors \u2014 that pink, that white, those crevices, those hard surfaces \u2014 in our conservation projects. We can also use that knowledge if we're going to put something underwater, like a sea wall or a pier. We can choose to use the materials and colors and textures that might bias the system back toward those corals. Now in addition to the surfaces, we also study the chemical and microbial signals that attract corals to reefs. Starting about six years ago, I began culturing bacteria from surfaces where corals had settled. And I tried those one by one by one, looking for the bacteria that would convince corals to settle and attach. And we now have many bacterial strains in our freezer that will reliably cause corals to go through that settlement and attachment process. So as we speak, my colleagues in Cura\u00e7ao are testing those bacteria to see if they'll help us raise more coral settlers in the lab, and to see if those coral settlers will survive better when we put them back underwater.Now in addition to these tools, we also try to uncover the mysteries of species that are under-studied. This is one of my favorite corals, and always has been: dendrogyra cylindrus, the pillar coral. I love it because it makes this ridiculous shape, because its tentacles are fat and look fuzzy and because it's rare. Finding one of these on a reef is a treat. In fact, it's so rare, that last year it was listed as a threatened species on the endangered species list. And this was in part because in over 30 years of research surveys, scientists had never found a baby pillar coral. We weren't even sure if they could still reproduce, or if they were still reproducing.So four years ago, we started following these at night and watching to see if we could figure out when they spawn in Cura\u00e7ao. We got some good tips from our colleagues in Florida, who had seen one in 2007, one in 2008, and eventually we figured out when they spawn in Cura\u00e7ao and we caught it. Here's a female on the left with some eggs in her tissue, about to release them into the seawater. And here's a male on the right, releasing sperm. We collected this, we got it back to the lab, we got it to fertilize and we got baby pillar corals swimming in our lab. Thanks to the work of our scientific aunts and uncles, and thanks to the 10 years of practice we've had in Cura\u00e7ao at raising other coral species, we got some of those larvae to go through the rest of the process and settle and attach, and turn into metamorphosed corals. So this is the first pillar coral baby that anyone ever saw.(Applause)And I have to say \u2014 if you think baby pandas are cute, this is cuter.(Laughter)So we're starting to figure out the secrets to this process, the secrets of coral reproduction and how we might help them. And this is true all around the world; scientists are figuring out new ways to handle their embryos, to get them to settle, maybe even figuring out the methods to preserve them at low temperatures, so that we can preserve their genetic diversity and work with them more often. But this is still so low-tech. We are limited by the space on our bench, the number of hands in the lab and the number of coffees we can drink in any given hour.Now, compare that to our other crises and our other areas of concern as a society. We have advanced medical technology, we have defense technology, we have scientific technology, we even have advanced technology for art. But our technology for conservation is behind. Think back to the most difficult job you ever did. Many of you would say it was being a parent. My mother described being a parent as something that makes your life far more amazing and far more difficult than you could've ever possibly imagined. I've been trying to help corals become parents for over 10 years now. And watching the wonder of life has certainly filled me with amazement to the core of my soul. But I've also seen how difficult it is for them to become parents. The pillar corals spawned again two weeks ago, and we collected their eggs and brought them back to the lab. And here you see one embryo dividing, alongside 14 eggs that didn't fertilize and will blow up. They'll be infected with bacteria, they will explode and those bacteria will threaten the life of this one embryo that has a chance. We don't know if it was our handling methods that went wrong and we don't know if it was just this coral on this reef, always suffering from low fertility. Whatever the cause, we have much more work to do before we can use baby corals to grow or fix or, yes, maybe save coral reefs.So never mind that they're worth hundreds of billions of dollars. Coral reefs are hardworking animals and plants and microbes and fungi. They're providing us with art and food and medicine. And we almost took out an entire generation of corals. But a few made it anyway, despite our best efforts, and now it's time for us to thank them for the work they did and give them every chance they have to raise the coral reefs of the future, their coral babies.Thank you so much.(Applause)", "id": 2385, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:12.794 --> 00:00:15.082\nWhat was the most\ndifficult job you

appreciated?\n\n00:00:45.071 --> 00:00:47.327\nThe people in our communities\nwho do these jobs\n\n00:00:47.351 --> 00:00:50.984\ndeserve our attention, our love\nand our deepest support.\n\n00:00:51.375 --> 00:00:53.818\nBut people aren't the only ones\nin our communities\n\n00:00:53.842 --> 00:00:55.644\nwho do these difficult jobs.\n\n00:00:56.072 --> 00:00:58.834\nThese jobs are also done\nby the plants, the animals\n\n00:00:58.858 --> 00:01:01.290\nand the ecosystems on our planet,\n\n00:01:01.314 --> 00:01:04.803\nincluding the ecosystems I study:\nthe tropical coral reefs.\n\n00:01:05.598 --> 00:01:07.560\nCoral reefs are farmers.\n\n00:01:07.584 --> 00:01:10.794\nThey provide food, income\nand food security\n\n00:01:10.818 --> 00:01:13.381\nfor hundreds of millions\nof people around the world.\n\n00:01:13.405 --> 00:01:16.115\nCoral reefs are security guards.\n\n00:01:16.139 --> 00:01:18.896\nThe structures that they build\nprotect our shorelines\n\n00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:20.777\nfrom storm surge and waves,\n\n00:01:20.801 --> 00:01:24.467\nand the biological systems\nthat they house filter the water\n\n00:01:24.491 --> 00:01:26.890\nand make it safer for us to work and play.\n\n00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:30.072\nCoral reefs are chemists.\n\n00:01:30.096 --> 00:01:33.865\nThe molecules that we're discovering\non coral reefs are increasingly important\n\n00:01:33.889 --> 00:01:37.462\nin the search for new antibiotics\nand new cancer drugs.\n\n00:01:37.486 --> 00:01:39.641\nAnd coral reefs are artists.\n\n00:01:39.665 --> 00:01:41.160\nThe structures that they build\n\n00:01:41.184 --> 00:01:43.734\nare some of the most\nbeautiful things on planet Earth.\n\n00:01:43.758 --> 00:01:46.544\nAnd this beauty is the foundation\nof the tourism industry\n\n00:01:46.568 --> 00:01:51.089\nin many countries with few\nor little other natural resources.\n\n00:01:51.835 --> 00:01:55.095\nSo for all of these reasons,\nall of these ecosystem services,\n\n00:01:55.119 --> 00:01:57.804\neconomists estimate the value\nof the world's coral reefs\n\n00:01:57.828 --> 00:02:00.824\nin the hundreds of billions\nof dollars per year.\n\n00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:04.336\nAnd yet despite all that hard work\nbeing done for us\n\n00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:06.556\nand all that wealth that we gain,\n\n00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:11.025\nwe have done almost everything\nwe possibly could to destroy that.\n\n00:02:11.049 --> 00:02:13.002\nWe have taken the fish out of the oceans\n\n00:02:13.026 --> 00:02:15.624\nand we have added in fertilizer, sewage,\n\n00:02:15.648 --> 00:02:19.547\ndiseases, oil, pollution, sediments.\n\n00:02:19.571 --> 00:02:23.444\nWe have trampled the reefs physically\nwith our boats, our fins, our bulldozers,\n\n00:02:23.468 --> 00:02:25.975\nand we have changed the chemistry\nof the entire sea,\n\n00:02:25.999 --> 00:02:28.627\nwarmed the waters and made storms worse.\n\n00:02:28.651 --> 00:02:30.802\nAnd these would all be bad on their own,\n\n00:02:30.826 --> 00:02:32.584\nbut these threats magnify each other\n\n00:02:32.608 --> 00:02:35.564\nand compound one another\nand make each other worse.\n\n00:02:35.588 --> 00:02:36.981\nI'll give you an example.\n\n00:02:37.005 --> 00:02:41.330\nWhere I live and work, in Cura\u00e7ao,\na tropical storm went by a few years ago.\n\n00:02:41.354 --> 00:02:43.243\nAnd on the eastern end of the island,\n\n00:02:43.267 --> 00:02:45.211\nwhere the reefs are intact and thriving,\n\n00:02:45.235 --> 00:02:48.194\nyou could barely tell\na tropical storm had passed.\n\n00:02:48.218 --> 00:02:53.543\nBut in town, where corals had died\nfrom overfishing, from pollution,\n\n00:02:53.567 --> 00:02:55.670\nthe tropical storm picked up\nthe dead corals\n\n00:02:55.694 --> 00:02:58.636\nand used them as bludgeons\nto kill the corals that were left.\n\n00:02:59.319 --> 00:03:01.636\nThis is a coral that I studied\nduring my PhD --\n\n00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:03.229\nI got to know it quite well.\n\n00:03:03.253 --> 00:03:06.332\nAnd after this storm\ntook off half of its tissue,\n\n00:03:06.356 --> 00:03:08.025\nit became infested with algae,\n\n00:03:08.049 --> 00:03:10.804\nthe algae overgrew the tissue\nand that coral died.\n\n00:03:11.374 --> 00:03:15.336\nThis magnification of threats,\nthis compounding of factors\n\n00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:20.194\nis what Jeremy Jackson describes\nas the \"slippery slope to slime.\"\n\n00:03:20.657 --> 00:03:24.210\nIt's hardly even a metaphor\nbecause many of our reefs now\n\n00:03:24.234 --> 00:03:27.798\nare literally bacteria\nand algae and slime.\n\n00:03:28.912 --> 00:03:30.524\nNow, this is the part of the talk\n\n00:03:30.548 --> 00:03:33.437\nwhere you may expect me\nto launch into my plea\n\n00:03:33.461 --> 00:03:36.134\nfor us to all save the coral reefs.\n\n00:03:36.793 --> 00:03:38.901\nBut I have a confession to make:\n\n00:03:39.702 --> 00:03:42.297\nthat phrase drives me nuts.\n\n00:03:42.321 --> 00:03:46.012\nWhether I see it in a tweet,\nin a news headline\n\n00:03:46.036 --> 00:03:49.623\nor the glossy pages\nof a conservation brochure,\n\n00:03:49.647 --> 00:03:51.470\nthat phrase bothers me,\n\n00:03:51.494 --> 00:03:54.422\nbecause we as conservationists\nhave been sounding the alarms\n\n00:03:54.446 --> 00:03:56.850\nabout the death\nof coral reefs for decades.\n\n00:03:56.874 --> 00:04:00.934\nAnd yet, almost everyone I meet,\nno matter how educated,\n\n00:04:00.958 --> 00:04:04.781\nis not sure what a coral is\nor where they come from.\n\n00:04:05.447 --> 00:04:08.772\nHow would we get someone to care\nabout the world's coral reefs\n\n00:04:08.796 --> 00:04:12.465\nwhen it's an abstract thing\nthey can barely understand?\n\n00:04:13.329 --> 00:04:16.401\nIf they don't understand\nwhat a coral is or where it comes from,\n\n00:04:16.425 --> 00:04:19.092\nor how funny or interesting\nor beautiful it is,\n\n00:04:19.116 --> 00:04:21.755\nwhy would we expect them\nto care about saving them?\n\n00:04:22.468 --> 00:04:23.786\nSo let's change that.\n\n00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:26.351\nWhat is a coral\nand where does it come from?\n\n00:04:27.245 --> 00:04:29.413\nCorals are born\nin a number of different ways,\n\n00:04:29.437 --> 00:04:33.660\nbut most often by mass spawning:\nall of the individuals of a single species\n\n00:04:33.684 --> 00:04:35.020\non one night a year,\n\n00:04:35.044 --> 00:04:37.757\nreleasing all the eggs\nthey've made that year\n\n00:04:37.781 --> 00:04:38.975\ninto the water column,\n\n00:04:38.999 --> 00:04:41.443\npackaged into bundles with sperm cells.\n\n00:04:41.467 --> 00:04:44.943\nAnd those bundles go to the surface\nof the ocean and break apart.\n\n00:04:44.967 --> 00:04:47.713\nAnd hopefully -- hopefully --\nat the surface of the ocean,\n\n00:04:47.737 --> 00:04:49.958\nthey meet the eggs and sperm\nfrom other corals.\n\n00:04:49.982 --> 00:04:53.090\nAnd that is why you need\nlots of corals on a coral reef --\n\n00:04:53.114 --> 00:04:56.658\nso that all of their eggs can\nmeet their match at the surface.\n\n00:04:57.212 --> 00:05:00.320\nWhen they're fertilized, they do\nwhat any other animal egg does:\n\n00:05:00.344 --> 00:05:02.589\ndivides in half again and again and again.\n\n00:05:03.017 --> 00:05:05.495\nTaking these photos\nunder the microscope every year\n\n00:05:05.519 --> 00:05:08.687\nis one of my favorite and most\nmagical moments of the year.\n\n00:05:08.711 --> 00:05:12.664\nAt the end of all this cell division,\nthey turn into a swimming larva --\n\n00:05:12.688 --> 00:05:16.422\na little tiny blob of fat\nthe size of a poppy seed,\n\n00:05:16.446 --> 00:05:19.116\nbut with all of the sensory\nsystems that we have.\n\n00:05:19.140 --> 00:05:24.796\nThey can sense color and light,\ntextures, chemicals, pH.\n\n00:05:24.820 --> 00:05:27.821\nThey can even feel pressure waves;\nthey can hear sound.\n\n00:05:28.211 --> 00:05:29.505\nAnd they use those talents\n\n00:05:29.529 --> 00:05:32.362\nto search the bottom of the reef\nfor a place to attach\n\n00:05:32.386 --> 00:05:33.985\nand live the rest of their lives.\n\n00:05:34.009 --> 00:05:37.385\nSo imagine finding a place\nwhere you would live the rest of your life\n\n00:05:37.409 --> 00:05:39.182\nwhen you were just two days old.\n\n00:05:39.738 --> 00:05:42.505\nThey attach in the place\nthey find most suitable,\n\n00:05:42.529 --> 00:05:44.608\nthey build a skeleton\nunderneath themselves,\n\n00:05:44.632 --> 00:05:46.221\nthey build a mouth and tentacles,\n\n00:05:46.245 --> 00:05:50.348\nand then they begin the difficult work\nof building the world's coral reefs.\n\n00:05:51.082 --> 00:05:54.927\nOne coral polyp will divide itself\nagain and again and again,\n\n00:05:54.951 --> 00:05:57.292\nleaving a limestone skeleton\nunderneath itself\n\n00:05:57.316 --> 00:05:59.381\nand growing up toward the sun.\n\n00:05:59.864 --> 00:06:02.586\nGiven hundreds of years and many species,\n\n00:06:02.610 --> 00:06:04.948\nwhat you get is a massive\nlimestone structure\n\n00:06:04.972 --> 00:06:07.484\nthat can be seen from space in many cases,\n\n00:06:07.508 --> 00:06:10.876\ncovered by a thin skin\nof these hardworking animals.\n\n00:06:11.583 --> 00:06:15.988\nNow, there are only a few hundred species\nof corals on the planet, maybe 1,000.\n\n00:06:16.393 --> 00:06:21.127\nBut these systems house millions\nand millions of other species,\n\n00:06:21.151 --> 00:06:23.635\nand that diversity is what\nstabilizes the systems,\n\n00:06:23.659 --> 00:06:25.873\nand it's where we're finding\nour new medicines.\n\n00:06:25.897 --> 00:06:28.966\nIt's how we find new sources of food.\n\n00:06:29.799 --> 00:06:32.140\nI'm lucky enough to work\non the island of Cura\u00e7ao,\n\n00:06:32.164 --> 00:06:34.420\nwhere we still have reefs\nthat look like this.\n\n00:06:34.444 --> 00:06:38.755\nBut, indeed, much of the Caribbean\nand much of our world\n\n00:06:38.779 --> 00:06:40.645\nis much more like this.\n\n00:06:40.669 --> 00:06:43.692\nScientists have studied\nin increasing detail\n\n00:06:43.716 --> 00:06:45.498\nthe loss of the world's coral reefs,\n\n00:06:45.522 --> 00:06:49.083\nand they have documented\nwith increasing certainty the causes.\n\n00:06:49.107 --> 00:06:52.099\nBut in my research, I'm not\ninterested in looking backward.\n\n00:06:52.123 --> 00:06:55.184\nMy colleagues and I in Cura\u00e7ao\nare interested in looking forward\n\n00:06:55.208 --> 00:06:56.565\nat what might be.\n\n00:06:56.589 --> 00:07:00.251\nAnd we have the tiniest reason\nto be optimistic.\n\n00:07:00.782 --> 00:07:02.559\nBecause even in some of these reefs\n\n00:07:02.583 --> 00:07:06.232\nthat we probably could have\nwritten off long ago,\n\n00:07:06.256 --> 00:07:10.721\nwe sometimes see baby corals\narrive and survive anyway.\n\n00:07:11.151 --> 00:07:14.426\nAnd we're starting to think\nthat baby corals may have the ability\n\n00:07:14.450 --> 00:07:18.053\nto adjust to some of the conditions\nthat the adults couldn't.\n\n00:07:18.077 --> 00:07:20.093\nThey may be able to adjust\n\n00:07:20.117 --> 00:07:23.999\never so slightly more readily\nto this human planet.\n\n00:07:24.848 --> 00:07:28.891\nSo in the research I do\nwith my colleagues in Cura\u00e7ao,\n\n00:07:28.915 --> 00:07:31.428\nwe try to figure out\nwhat a baby coral needs\n\n00:07:31.452 --> 00:07:32.976\nin that critical early stage,\n\n00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:34.167\nwhat it's looking for\n\n00:07:34.191 --> 00:07:36.731\nand how we can try to help it\nthrough that process.\n\n00:07:36.755 --> 00:07:39.596\nI'm going to show you three examples\nof the work we've done\n\n00:07:39.620 --> 00:07:41.557\nto try to answer those questions.\n\n00:07:42.533 --> 00:07:47.308\nA few years ago we took a 3D printer\nand we made coral choice surveys --\n\n00:07:47.332 --> 00:07:49.268\ndifferent colors and different textures,\n\n00:07:49.292 --> 00:07:52.162\nand we simply asked the coral\nwhere they preferred to settle.\n\n00:07:52.186 --> 00:07:55.171\nAnd we found that corals,\neven without the biology involved,\n\n00:07:55.195 --> 00:07:58.354\nstill prefer white and pink,\nthe colors of a healthy reef.\n\n00:07:58.378 --> 00:08:01.513\nAnd they prefer crevices\nand grooves and holes,\n\n00:08:01.537 --> 00:08:03.561\nwhere they will be safe\nfrom being trampled\n\n00:08:03.585 --> 00:08:04.901\nor eaten by a predator.\n\n00:08:05.234 --> 00:08:06.690\nSo we can use this knowledge,\n\n00:08:06.714 --> 00:08:09.733\nwe can go back and say\nwe need to restore those factors --\n\n00:08:09.757 --> 00:08:12.936\nthat pink, that white, those crevices,\nthose hard surfaces --\n\n00:08:12.960 --> 00:08:14.703\nin our conservation projects.\n\n00:08:14.727 --> 00:08:16.188\nWe can also use that knowledge\n\n00:08:16.212 --> 00:08:19.751\nif we're going to put something\nunderwater, like a sea wall or a pier.\n\n00:08:19.775 --> 00:08:22.815\nWe can choose to use the materials\nand colors and textures\n\n00:08:22.839 --> 00:08:26.670\nthat might bias the system\nback toward those corals.\n\n00:08:27.445 --> 00:08:29.422\nNow in addition to the surfaces,\n\n00:08:29.446 --> 00:08:31.943\nwe also study the chemical\nand microbial signals\n\n00:08:31.967 --> 00:08:33.995\nthat attract corals to reefs.\n\n00:08:34.019 --> 00:08:36.919\nStarting about six years ago,\nI began culturing bacteria\n\n00:08:36.943 --> 00:08:39.035\nfrom surfaces where corals had settled.\n\n00:08:39.059 --> 00:08:41.892\nAnd I tried those one by one by one,\n\n00:08:41.916 --> 00:08:46.682\nlooking for the bacteria that would\nconvince corals to settle and attach.\n\n00:08:46.706 --> 00:08:49.856\nAnd we now have many\nbacterial strains in our freezer\n\n00:08:49.880 --> 00:08:51.389\nthat will reliably cause corals\n\n00:08:51.413 --> 00:08:54.382\nto go through that settlement\nand attachment process.\n\n00:08:54.406 --> 00:08:55.605\nSo as we speak,\n\n00:08:55.629 --> 00:08:58.049\nmy colleagues in Cura\u00e7ao\nare testing those bacteria\n\n00:08:58.073 --> 00:09:01.397\nto see if they'll help us raise\nmore coral settlers in the lab,\n\n00:09:01.421 --> 00:09:04.008\nand to see if those coral settlers\nwill survive better\n\n00:09:04.032 --> 00:09:05.841\nwhen we put them back underwater.\n\n00:09:06.262 --> 00:09:09.487\nNow in addition to these tools,\nwe also try to uncover the mysteries\n\n00:09:09.511 --> 00:09:11.964\nof species that are under-studied.\n\n00:09:12.797 --> 00:09:16.086\nThis is one of my favorite corals,\nand always has been:\n\n00:09:16.110 --> 00:09:18.599\ndendrogyra cylindrus, the pillar coral.\n\n00:09:19.031 --> 00:09:21.938\nI love it because it makes\nthis ridiculous shape,\n\n00:09:21.962 --> 00:09:25.105\nbecause its tentacles\nare fat and look fuzzy\n\n00:09:25.129 --> 00:09:26.569\nand because it's rare.\n\n00:09:26.593 --> 00:09:29.067\nFinding one of these on a reef is a treat.\n\n00:09:29.653 --> 00:09:30.805\nIn fact, it's so rare,\n\n00:09:30.829 --> 00:09:33.345\nthat last year it was listed\nas a threatened species\n\n00:09:33.369 --> 00:09:35.224\non the endangered species list.\n\n00:09:35.248 --> 00:09:38.555\nAnd this was in part because\nin over 30 years of research surveys,\n\n00:09:38.579 --> 00:09:42.435\nscientists had never found\na baby pillar coral.\n\n00:09:42.761 --> 00:09:45.175\nWe weren't even sure\nif they could still reproduce,\n\n00:09:45.199 --> 00:09:47.198\nor if they were still reproducing.\n\n00:09:47.718 --> 00:09:50.387\nSo four years ago, we started\nfollowing these at night\n\n00:09:50.411 --> 00:09:54.700\nand watching to see if we could\nfigure out when they spawn in Cura\u00e7ao.\n\n00:09:55.950 --> 00:09:58.638\nWe got some good tips\nfrom our colleagues in Florida,\n\n00:09:58.662 --> 00:10:02.720\nwho had seen one in 2007, one in 2008,\n\n00:10:02.744 --> 00:10:05.417\nand eventually we figured out\nwhen they spawn in Cura\u00e7ao\n\n00:10:05.441 --> 00:10:06.800\nand we caught it.\n\n00:10:06.824 --> 00:10:09.522\nHere's a female on the left\nwith some eggs in her tissue,\n\n00:10:09.546 --> 00:10:11.466\nabout to release them into the seawater.\n\n00:10:11.490 --> 00:10:14.127\nAnd here's a male\non the right, releasing sperm.\n\n00:10:14.741 --> 00:10:18.425\nWe collected this, we got it\nback to the lab, we got it to fertilize\n\n00:10:18.449 --> 00:10:21.733\nand we got baby pillar corals\nswimming in our lab.\n\n00:10:22.478 --> 00:10:25.018\nThanks to the work\nof our scientific aunts and uncles,\n\n00:10:25.042 --> 00:10:27.899\nand thanks to the 10 years of practice\nwe've had in Cura\u00e7ao\n\n00:10:27.923 --> 00:10:30.116\nat raising other coral species,\n\n00:10:30.140 --> 00:10:34.015\nwe got some of those larvae\nto go through the rest of the process\n\n00:10:34.039 --> 00:10:35.691\nand settle and attach,\n\n00:10:35.715 --> 00:10:38.426\nand turn into metamorphosed corals.\n\n00:10:38.450 --> 00:10:43.194\nSo this is the first pillar coral baby\nthat anyone ever saw.\n\n00:10:43.744 --> 00:10:49.164\n(Applause)\n\n00:10:49.188 --> 00:10:52.362\nAnd I have to say --\nif you think baby pandas are cute,\n\n00:10:52.386 --> 00:10:53.624\nthis is cuter.\n\n00:10:53.648 --> 00:10:55.631\n(Laughter)\n\n00:10:56.194 --> 00:10:59.318\nSo we're starting to figure out\nthe secrets to this process,\n\n00:10:59.342 --> 00:11:02.690\nthe secrets of coral reproduction\nand how we might help them.\n\n00:11:03.047 --> 00:11:04.895\nAnd this is true all around the world;\n\n00:11:04.919 --> 00:11:07.811\nscientists are figuring out new ways\nto handle their embryos,\n\n00:11:07.835 --> 00:11:08.993\nto get them to settle,\n\n00:11:09.017 --> 00:11:13.551\nmaybe even figuring out the methods\nto preserve them at low temperatures,\n\n00:11:13.575 --> 00:11:16.691\nso that we can preserve\ntheir genetic diversity\n\n00:11:16.715 --> 00:11:18.597\nand work with them more often.\n\n00:11:18.942 --> 00:11:21.815\nBut this is still so low-tech.\n\n00:11:22.218 --> 00:11:27.233\nWe are limited by the space on our bench,\nthe number of hands in the lab\n\n00:11:27.257 --> 00:11:31.427\nand the number of coffees\nwe can drink in any given hour.\n\n00:11:32.063 --> 00:11:34.556\nNow, compare that to our other crises\n\n00:11:34.580 --> 00:11:37.793\nand our other areas\nof concern as a society.\n\n00:11:38.223 --> 00:11:41.875\nWe have advanced medical technology,\nwe have defense technology,\n\n00:11:41.899 --> 00:11:43.496\nwe have scientific technology,\n\n00:11:43.520 --> 00:11:45.946\nwe even have advanced technology for art.\n\n00:11:45.970 --> 00:11:51.367\nBut our technology\nfor conservation is behind.\n\n00:11:52.980 --> 00:11:56.125\nThink back to the most\ndifficult job you ever did.\n\n00:11:56.620 --> 00:11:59.855\nMany of you would say\nit was being a parent.\n\n00:12:00.272 --> 00:12:01.929\nMy mother described being a parent\n\n00:12:01.953 --> 00:12:06.164\nas something that makes your life\nfar more amazing and far more difficult\n\n00:12:06.188 --> 00:12:08.718\nthan you could've ever possibly imagined.\n\n00:12:08.742 --> 00:12:12.767\nI've been trying to help corals\nbecome parents for over 10 years now.\n\n00:12:13.521 --> 00:12:15.691\nAnd watching the wonder of life\n\n00:12:15.715 --> 00:12:19.742\nhas certainly filled me with amazement\nto the core of my soul.\n\n00:12:19.766 --> 00:12:23.248\nBut I've also seen how difficult\nit is for them to become parents.\n\n00:12:24.408 --> 00:12:26.588\nThe pillar corals spawned\nagain two weeks ago,\n\n00:12:26.612 --> 00:12:29.501\nand we collected their eggs\nand brought them back to the lab.\n\n00:12:29.525 --> 00:12:31.583\nAnd here you see one embryo dividing,\n\n00:12:31.607 --> 00:12:34.481\nalongside 14 eggs that didn't fertilize\n\n00:12:34.505 --> 00:12:36.165\nand will blow up.\n\n00:12:36.490 --> 00:12:39.225\nThey'll be infected with bacteria,\nthey will explode\n\n00:12:39.249 --> 00:12:42.991\nand those bacteria will threaten\nthe life of this one embryo\n\n00:12:43.015 --> 00:12:45.145\nthat has a chance.\n\n00:12:45.534 --> 00:12:48.497\nWe don't know if it was our handling\nmethods that went wrong\n\n00:12:48.521 --> 00:12:50.148\nand we don't know\n\n00:12:50.172 --> 00:12:55.090\nif it was just this coral on this reef,\nalways suffering from low fertility.\n\n00:12:55.540 --> 00:12:56.845\nWhatever the cause,\n\n00:12:56.869 --> 00:13:01.386\nwe have much more work to do\nbefore we can use baby corals\n\n00:13:01.410 --> 00:13:06.352\nto grow or fix or, yes,\nmaybe save coral reefs.\n\n00:13:07.408 --> 00:13:10.479\nSo never mind that they're worth\nhundreds of billions of dollars.\n\n00:13:10.503 --> 00:13:15.930\nCoral reefs are hardworking animals\nand plants and microbes and fungi.\n\n00:13:15.954 --> 00:13:19.574\nThey're providing us with art\nand food and medicine.\n\n00:13:19.970 --> 00:13:23.546\nAnd we almost took out\nan entire generation of corals.\n\n00:13:23.933 --> 00:13:27.974\nBut a few made it anyway,\ndespite our best efforts,\n\n00:13:27.998 --> 00:13:31.130\nand now it's time for us to thank them\nfor the work they did\n\n00:13:31.154 --> 00:13:35.979\nand give them every chance they have\nto raise the coral reefs of the future,\n\n00:13:36.003 --> 00:13:37.491\ntheir coral babies.\n\n00:13:37.515 --> 00:13:38.710\nThank you so much.\n\n00:13:38.734 -->

If you ask the Internet, this is what you'll be told. Never mind that this is what you'll actually produce if you attempt to work at a computer with a baby on your lap.(Laughter)But no, this isn't a working mother. You'll notice a theme in these photos. We'll look at a lot of them. That theme is amazing natural lighting, which, as we all know, is the hallmark of every American workplace.There are thousands of images like these. Just put the term \"working mother\" into any Google image search engine, stock photo site. They're all over the Internet, they're topping blog posts and news pieces, and I've become kind of obsessed with them and the lie that they tell us and the comfort that they give us, that when it comes to new working motherhood in America, everything's fine.But it's not fine. As a country, we are sending millions of women back to work every year, incredibly and kind of horrifically soon after they give birth. That's a moral problem but today I'm also going to tell you why it's an economic problem.I got so annoyed and obsessed with the unreality of these images, which look nothing like my life, that I recently decided to shoot and star in a parody series of stock photos that I hoped the world would start to use just showing the really awkward reality of going back to work when your baby's food source is attached to your body. I'm just going to show you two of them.(Laughter)Nothing says \"Give that girl a promotion\" like leaking breast milk through your dress during a presentation. You'll notice that there's no baby in this photo, because that's not how this works, not for most working mothers.Did you know, and this will ruin your day, that every time a toilet is flushed, its contents are aerosolized and they'll stay airborne for hours? And yet, for many new working mothers, this is the only place during the day that they can find to make food for their newborn babies.I put these things, a whole dozen of them, into the world. I wanted to make a point. I didn't know what I was also doing was opening a door, because now, total strangers from all walks of life write to me all the time just to tell me what it's like for them to go back to work within days or weeks of having a baby. I'm going to share 10 of their stories with you today. They are totally real, some of them are very raw, and not one of them looks anything like this.Here's the first. \"I was an active duty service member at a federal prison. I returned to work after the maximum allowed eight weeks for my C-section. A male coworker was annoyed that I had been out on 'vacation,' so he intentionally opened the door on me while I was pumping breast milk and stood in the doorway with inmates in the hallway.\"Most of the stories that these women, total strangers, send to me now, are not actually even about breastfeeding.A woman wrote to me to say, \"I gave birth to twins and went back to work after seven unpaid weeks. Emotionally, I was a wreck. Physically, I had a severe hemorrhage during labor, and major tearing, so I could barely get up, sit or walk. My employer told me I wasn't allowed to use my available vacation days because it was budget season.\"I've come to believe that we can't look situations like these in the eye because then we'd be horrified, and if we get horrified then we have to do something about it. So we choose to look at, and believe, this image. I don't really know what's going on in this picture, because I find it weird and slightly creepy.(Laughter)Like, what is she doing? But I know what it tells us. It tells us that everything's fine. This working mother, all working mothers and all of their babies, are fine. There's nothing to see here. And anyway, women have made a choice, so none of it's even our problem.I want to break this choice thing down into two parts. The first choice says that women have chosen to work. So, that's not true. Today in America, women make up 47 percent of the workforce, and in 40 percent of American households a woman is the sole or primary breadwinner. Our paid work is a part, a huge part, of the engine of this economy, and it is essential for the engines of our families. On a national level, our paid work is not optional.Choice number two says that women are choosing to have babies, so women alone should bear the consequences of those choices. You know, that's one of those things that when you hear it in passing, can sound correct. I didn't make you have a baby. I certainly wasn't there when that happened. But that stance ignores a fundamental truth, which is that our procreation on a national scale is not optional. The babies that women, many of them working women, are having today, will one day fill our workforce, protect our shores, make up our tax base. Our procreation on a national scale is not optional. These aren't choices. We need women to work. We need working women to have babies. So we should make doing those things at the same time at least palatable, right?OK, this is pop quiz time: what percentage of working women in America do you think have no access to paid maternity leave? 88 percent. 88 percent of working mothers will not get one minute of paid leave after they have a baby.So now you're thinking about unpaid leave. It exists in America. It's called FMLA. It does not work. Because of the way it's structured, all kinds of exceptions, half of new mothers are ineligible for it.Here's what that looks like. \"We adopted our son. When I got the call, the day he was born, I had to take off work. I had not been there long enough to qualify for FMLA, so I wasn't eligible for unpaid leave. When I took time off to meet my newborn son, I lost my job.\"These corporate stock photos hide another reality, another layer. Of those who do have access to just that unpaid leave, most women can't afford to take much of it at all. A nurse told me, \"I didn't qualify for short-term disability because my pregnancy was considered a preexisting condition. We used up all of our tax returns and half of our savings during my six unpaid weeks. We just couldn't manage any longer. Physically it was hard, but emotionally it was worse. I struggled for months being away from my son.\"So this decision to go back to work so early, it's a rational economic decision driven by family finances, but it's often physically horrific because putting a human into the world is messy.A waitress told me, \"With my first baby, I was back at work five weeks postpartum. With my second, I had to have major surgery after giving birth, so I waited until six weeks to go back. I had third degree tears.\"23 percent of new working mothers in America will be back on the job within two weeks of giving birth.\"I worked as a bartender and cook, average of 75 hours a week while pregnant. I had to return to work before my baby was a month old, working 60 hours a week. One of my coworkers was only able to afford 10 days off with her baby.\"Of course, this isn't just a scenario with economic and physical implications. Childbirth is, and always will be, an enormous psychological event.A teacher told me, \"I returned to work eight weeks after my son was born. I already suffer from anxiety, but the panic attacks I had prior to returning to work were unbearable.\"Statistically speaking, the shorter a woman's leave after having a baby, the more likely she will be to suffer from postpartum mood disorders like depression and anxiety, and among many potential consequences of those disorders, suicide is the second most common cause of death in a woman's first year postpartum.Heads up that this next story \u2014 I've never met this woman, but I find it hard to get through.\"I feel tremendous grief and rage that I lost an essential, irreplaceable and formative time with my son. Labor and delivery left me feeling absolutely broken. For months, all I remember is the screaming: colic, they said. On the inside, I was drowning. Every morning, I asked myself how much longer I could do it. I was allowed to bring my baby to work. I closed my office door while I rocked and shushed and begged him to stop screaming so I wouldn't get in trouble. I hid behind that office door every damn day and cried while he screamed. I cried in the bathroom while I washed out the pump equipment. Every day, I cried all the way to work and all the way home again. I promised my boss that the work I didn't get done during the day, I'd make up at night from home. I thought, there's just something wrong with me that I can't swing this.\"So those are the mothers. What of the babies? As a country, do we care about the millions of babies born every year to working mothers? I say we don't, not until they're of working and tax-paying and military-serving age. We tell them we'll see them in 18 years, and getting there is kind of on them. One of the reasons I know this is that babies whose mothers have 12 or more weeks at home with them are more likely to get their vaccinations and their well checks in their first year, so those babies are more protected from deadly and disabling diseases. But those things are hidden behind images like this.America has a message for new mothers who work and for their babies. Whatever time you get together, you should be grateful for it, and you're an inconvenience to the economy and to your employers. That narrative of gratitude runs through a lot of the stories I hear.A woman told me, \"I went back at eight weeks after my C-section because my husband was out of work. Without me, my daughter had failure to thrive. She wouldn't take a bottle. She started losing weight. Thankfully, my manager was very understanding. He let my mom bring my baby, who was on oxygen and a monitor, four times a shift so I could nurse her.\"There's a little club of countries in the world that offer no national paid leave to new mothers. Care to guess who they are? The first eight make up eight million in total population. They are Papua New Guinea, Suriname and the tiny island nations of Micronesia, Marshall Islands, Nauru, Niue, Palau and Tonga. Number nine is the United States of America, with 320 million people. Oh, that's it. That's the end of the list. Every other economy on the planet has found a way to make some level of national paid leave work for the people doing the work of the future of those countries, but we say, \"We couldn't possibly do that.\" We say that the market will solve this problem, and then we cheer when corporations offer even more paid leave to the women who are already the highest-educated and highest-paid among us. Remember that 88 percent? Those middle- and low-income women are not going to participate in that. We know that there are staggering economic, financial, physical and emotional costs to this approach. We have decided \u2014 decided, not an accident, to pass these costs directly on to working mothers and their babies. We know the price tag is higher for low-income women, therefore disproportionately for women of color. We pass them on anyway.All of this is to America's shame. But it's also to America's risk. Because what would happen if all of these individual so-called choices to have babies started to turn into individual choices not to have babies.One woman told me, \"New motherhood is hard. It shouldn't be traumatic. When we talk about expanding our family now, we focus on how much time I would have to care for myself and a new baby. If we were to have to do it again the same way as with our first, we might stick with one kid.\"The birthrate needed in America to keep the population stable is 2.1 live births per woman. In America today, we are at 1.86. We need women to have babies, and we are actively disincentivizing working women from doing that. What would happen to work force, to innovation, to GDP, if one by one, the working mothers of this country were to decide that they can't bear to do this thing more than once?I'm here today with only one idea worth spreading, and you've guessed what it is. It is long since time for the most powerful country on Earth to offer national paid leave to the people doing the work of the future of this country and to the babies who represent that future. Childbirth is a public good. This leave should be state-subsidized. It should have no exceptions for small businesses, length of employment or entrepreneurs. It should be able to be shared between partners. I've talked today a lot about mothers, but co-parents matter on so many levels.Not one more woman should have to go back to work while she is hobbling and bleeding. Not one more family should have to drain their savings account to buy a few days of rest and recovery and bonding. Not one more fragile infant should have to go directly from the incubator to day care because his parents have used up all of their meager time sitting in the NICU. Not one more working family should be told that the collision of their work, their needed work and their needed parenthood, is their problem alone.The catch is that when this is happening to a new family, it is consuming, and a family with a new baby is more financially vulnerable than they've ever been before, so that new mother cannot afford to speak up on her own behalf. But all of us have voices. I am done, done having babies, and you might be pre-baby, you might be post-baby, you might be no baby. It should not matter. We have to stop framing this as a mother's issue, or even a women's issue. This is an American issue.We need to stop buying the lie that these images tell us. We need to stop being comforted by them. We need to question why we're told that this can't work when we see it work everywhere all over the world. We need to recognize that this American reality is to our dishonor and to our peril. Because this is not, this is not, and this is not what a working mother looks like.(Applause)", "id": 2384, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:12.318 -->

awkward reality\nof going back to work\n\n00:01:40.638 --> 00:01:44.198\nwhen your baby's food source\nis attached to your body.\n\n00:01:45.278 --> 00:01:47.654\nI'm just going to show you two of them.\n\n00:01:47.678 --> 00:01:49.734\n(Laughter)\n\n00:01:49.758 --> 00:01:52.854\nNothing says \"Give that girl a promotion\"\nlike leaking breast milk\n\n00:01:52.878 --> 00:01:55.014\nthrough your dress during a presentation.\n\n00:01:55.038 --> 00:01:57.454\nYou'll notice that there's\nno baby in this photo,\n\n00:01:57.478 --> 00:02:00.094\nbecause that's not how this works,\n\n00:02:00.118 --> 00:02:02.454\nnot for most working mothers.\n\n00:02:02.478 --> 00:02:04.534\nDid you know, and this will ruin your day,\n\n00:02:04.558 --> 00:02:07.734\nthat every time a toilet is flushed,\nits contents are aerosolized\n\n00:02:07.758 --> 00:02:10.174\nand they'll stay airborne for hours?\n\n00:02:10.198 --> 00:02:12.934\nAnd yet, for many new working mothers,\n\n00:02:12.958 --> 00:02:16.214\nthis is the only place during the day\nthat they can find to make food\n\n00:02:16.238 --> 00:02:17.558\nfor their newborn babies.\n\n00:02:18.838 --> 00:02:22.294\nI put these things,\na whole dozen of them, into the world.\n\n00:02:22.318 --> 00:02:23.934\nI wanted to make a point.\n\n00:02:23.958 --> 00:02:27.374\nI didn't know what I was also doing\nwas opening a door,\n\n00:02:27.398 --> 00:02:30.934\nbecause now, total strangers\nfrom all walks of life\n\n00:02:30.958 --> 00:02:32.894\nwrite to me all the time\n\n00:02:32.918 --> 00:02:36.774\njust to tell me what it's like\nfor them to go back to work\n\n00:02:36.798 --> 00:02:39.814\nwithin days or weeks of having a baby.\n\n00:02:39.838 --> 00:02:42.414\nI'm going to share\n10 of their stories with you today.\n\n00:02:42.438 --> 00:02:45.814\nThey are totally real,\nsome of them are very raw,\n\n00:02:45.838 --> 00:02:48.878\nand not one of them\nlooks anything like this.\n\n00:02:50.318 --> 00:02:52.094\nHere's the first.\n\n00:02:52.118 --> 00:02:55.814\n\"I was an active duty\nservice member at a federal prison.\n\n00:02:55.838 --> 00:03:00.214\nI returned to work after the maximum\nallowed eight weeks for my C-section.\n\n00:03:00.238 --> 00:03:04.294\nA male coworker was annoyed\nthat I had been out on 'vacation,'\n\n00:03:04.318 --> 00:03:07.747\nso he intentionally opened the door on me\nwhile I was pumping breast milk\n\n00:03:07.771 --> 00:03:11.814\nand stood in the doorway\nwith inmates in the hallway.\"\n\n00:03:11.838 --> 00:03:15.134\nMost of the stories that these women,\ntotal strangers, send to me now,\n\n00:03:15.158 --> 00:03:17.414\nare not actually even about breastfeeding.\n\n00:03:17.438 --> 00:03:19.334\nA woman wrote to me to say,\n\n00:03:19.358 --> 00:03:24.134\n\"I gave birth to twins and went back\nto work after seven unpaid weeks.\n\n00:03:24.158 --> 00:03:25.814\nEmotionally, I was a wreck.\n\n00:03:25.838 --> 00:03:30.174\nPhysically, I had a severe hemorrhage\nduring labor, and major tearing,\n\n00:03:30.198 --> 00:03:32.934\nso I could barely get up, sit or walk.\n\n00:03:32.958 --> 00:03:36.814\nMy employer told me I wasn't allowed\nto use my available vacation days\n\n00:03:36.838 --> 00:03:38.598\nbecause it was budget season.\"\n\n00:03:39.758 --> 00:03:44.374\nI've come to believe that we can't look\nsituations like these in the eye\n\n00:03:44.398 --> 00:03:46.214\nbecause then we'd be horrified,\n\n00:03:46.238 --> 00:03:49.294\nand if we get horrified\nthen we have to do something about it.\n\n00:03:49.318 --> 00:03:53.174\nSo we choose to look at,\nand believe, this image.\n\n00:03:53.198 --> 00:03:55.654\nI don't really know\nwhat's going on in this picture,\n\n00:03:55.678 --> 00:03:58.334\nbecause I find it weird\nand slightly creepy.\n\n00:03:58.358 --> 00:03:59.774\n(Laughter)\n\n00:03:59.798 --> 00:04:01.014\nLike, what is she doing?\n\n00:04:01.038 --> 00:04:05.054\nBut I know what it tells us.\n\n00:04:05.078 --> 00:04:07.614\nIt tells us that everything's fine.\n\n00:04:07.638 --> 00:04:11.374\nThis working mother, all working mothers\nand all of their babies, are fine.\n\n00:04:11.398 --> 00:04:13.374\nThere's nothing to see here.\n\n00:04:13.398 --> 00:04:16.814\nAnd anyway, women have made a choice,\n\n00:04:16.838 --> 00:04:19.134\nso none of it's even our problem.\n\n00:04:19.158 --> 00:04:22.094\nI want to break this choice thing\ndown into two parts.\n\n00:04:22.118 --> 00:04:25.734\nThe first choice says\nthat women have chosen to work.\n\n00:04:25.758 --> 00:04:27.974\nSo, that's not true.\n\n00:04:27.998 --> 00:04:33.213\nToday in America, women make up\n47 percent of the workforce,\n\n00:04:33.237 --> 00:04:35.214\nand in 40 percent of American households\n\n00:04:35.238 --> 00:04:38.774\na woman is the sole\nor primary breadwinner.\n\n00:04:38.798 --> 00:04:43.334\nOur paid work is a part, a huge part,\nof the engine of this economy,\n\n00:04:43.358 --> 00:04:46.134\nand it is essential\nfor the engines of our families.\n\n00:04:46.158 --> 00:04:50.334\nOn a national level,\nour paid work is not optional.\n\n00:04:50.358 --> 00:04:53.294\nChoice number two says that women\nare choosing to have babies,\n\n00:04:53.318 --> 00:04:56.438\nso women alone should bear\nthe consequences of those choices.\n\n00:04:58.158 --> 00:04:59.934\nYou know, that's one of those things\n\n00:04:59.958 --> 00:05:02.414\nthat when you hear it in passing,\ncan sound correct.\n\n00:05:02.438 --> 00:05:03.867\nI didn't make you have a baby.\n\n00:05:03.891 --> 00:05:05.974\nI certainly wasn't there\nwhen that happened.\n\n00:05:05.998 --> 00:05:12.014\nBut that stance\nignores a fundamental truth,\n\n00:05:12.038 --> 00:05:16.934\nwhich is that our procreation\non a national scale is not optional.\n\n00:05:16.958 --> 00:05:21.454\nThe babies that women, many of them\nworking women, are having today,\n\n00:05:21.478 --> 00:05:24.694\nwill one day fill our workforce,\nprotect our shores,\n\n00:05:24.718 --> 00:05:26.534\nmake up our tax base.\n\n00:05:26.558 --> 00:05:30.734\nOur procreation\non a national scale is not optional.\n\n00:05:30.758 --> 00:05:32.134\nThese aren't choices.\n\n00:05:32.158 --> 00:05:35.974\nWe need women to work.\nWe need working women to have babies.\n\n00:05:35.998 --> 00:05:38.475\nSo we should make\ndoing those things at the same time\n\n00:05:38.499 --> 00:05:39.899\nat least palatable, right?\n\n00:05:40.918 --> 00:05:43.614\nOK, this is pop quiz time:\n\n00:05:43.638 --> 00:05:46.574\nwhat percentage of working\nwomen in America do you think\n\n00:05:46.598 --> 00:05:50.118\nhave no access to paid maternity leave?\n\n00:05:51.398 --> 00:05:52.598\n88 percent.\n\n00:05:53.831 --> 00:05:56.974\n88 percent of working mothers\nwill not get one minute of paid leave\n\n00:05:56.998 --> 00:05:58.614\nafter they have a baby.\n\n00:05:58.638 --> 00:06:02.254\nSo now you're thinking about unpaid leave.\n\n00:06:02.278 --> 00:06:05.854\nIt exists in America.\nIt's called FMLA. It does not work.\n\n00:06:05.878 --> 00:06:08.854\nBecause of the way it's structured,\nall kinds of exceptions,\n\n00:06:08.878 --> 00:06:12.894\nhalf of new mothers are ineligible for it.\n\n00:06:12.918 --> 00:06:14.252\nHere's what that looks like.\n\n00:06:16.278 --> 00:06:18.094\n\"We adopted our son.\n\n00:06:18.118 --> 00:06:22.334\nWhen I got the call, the day he was born,\nI had to take off work.\n\n00:06:22.358 --> 00:06:25.494\nI had not been there long enough\nto qualify for FMLA,\n\n00:06:25.518 --> 00:06:28.254\nso I wasn't eligible for unpaid leave.\n\n00:06:28.278 --> 00:06:30.694\nWhen I took time off\nto meet my newborn son,\n\n00:06:30.718 --> 00:06:31.918\nI lost my job.\"\n\n00:06:33.798 --> 00:06:38.694\nThese corporate stock photos\nhide another reality, another layer.\n\n00:06:38.718 --> 00:06:42.334\nOf those who do have access\nto just that unpaid leave,\n\n00:06:42.358 --> 00:06:45.534\nmost women can't afford\nto take much of it at all.\n\n00:06:45.558 --> 00:06:49.054\nA nurse told me, \"I didn't qualify\nfor short-term disability\n\n00:06:49.078 --> 00:06:53.134\nbecause my pregnancy\nwas considered a preexisting condition.\n\n00:06:53.158 --> 00:06:55.825\nWe used up all of our tax returns\nand half of our savings\n\n00:06:55.849 --> 00:06:57.694\nduring my six unpaid weeks.\n\n00:06:57.718 --> 00:06:59.454\nWe just couldn't manage any longer.\n\n00:06:59.478 --> 00:07:02.014\nPhysically it was hard,\nbut emotionally it was worse.\n\n00:07:02.038 --> 00:07:05.014\nI struggled for months\nbeing away from my son.\"\n\n00:07:05.038 --> 00:07:07.934\nSo this decision\nto go back to work so early,\n\n00:07:07.958 --> 00:07:12.134\nit's a rational economic decision\ndriven by family finances,\n\n00:07:12.158 --> 00:07:14.414\nbut it's often physically horrific\n\n00:07:14.438 --> 00:07:17.974\nbecause putting a human\ninto the world is messy.\n\n00:07:17.998 --> 00:07:19.414\nA waitress told me,\n\n00:07:19.438 --> 00:07:22.974\n\"With my first baby, I was back\nat work five weeks postpartum.\n\n00:07:22.998 --> 00:07:26.054\nWith my second, I had to have\nmajor surgery after giving birth,\n\n00:07:26.078 --> 00:07:29.094\nso I waited until six weeks to go back.\n\n00:07:29.118 --> 00:07:31.198\nI had third degree tears.\"\n\n00:07:32.838 --> 00:07:35.894\n23 percent of new\nworking mothers in America\n\n00:07:35.918 --> 00:07:40.518\nwill be back on the job\nwithin two weeks of giving birth.\n\n00:07:42.278 --> 00:07:46.934\n\"I worked as a bartender and cook,\naverage of 75 hours a week while pregnant.\n\n00:07:46.958 --> 00:07:49.574\nI had to return to work\nbefore my baby was a month old,\n\n00:07:49.598 --> 00:07:51.614\nworking 60 hours a week.\n\n00:07:51.638 --> 00:07:56.694\nOne of my coworkers was only able\nto afford 10 days off with her baby.\"\n\n00:07:56.718 --> 00:08:00.894\nOf course, this isn't just a scenario\nwith economic and physical implications.\n\n00:08:00.918 --> 00:08:06.094\nChildbirth is, and always will be,\nan enormous psychological event.\n\n00:08:06.118 --> 00:08:08.214\nA teacher told me,\n\n00:08:08.238 --> 00:08:11.214\n\"I returned to work\neight weeks after my son was born.\n\n00:08:11.238 --> 00:08:13.134\nI already suffer from anxiety,\n\n00:08:13.158 --> 00:08:18.254\nbut the panic attacks I had prior\nto returning to work were unbearable.\"\n\n00:08:18.278 --> 00:08:20.374\nStatistically speaking,\n\n00:08:20.398 --> 00:08:23.094\nthe shorter a woman's leave\nafter having a baby,\n\n00:08:23.118 --> 00:08:26.334\nthe more likely she will be to suffer\nfrom postpartum mood disorders\n\n00:08:26.358 --> 00:08:28.454\nlike depression and anxiety,\n\n00:08:28.478 --> 00:08:32.494\nand among many potential\nconsequences of those disorders,\n\n00:08:32.518 --> 00:08:35.654\nsuicide is the second\nmost common cause of death\n\n00:08:35.678 --> 00:08:37.558\nin a woman's first year postpartum.\n\n00:08:39.198 --> 00:08:40.774\nHeads up that this next story --\n\n00:08:40.798 --> 00:08:45.374\nI've never met this woman,\nbut I find it hard to get through.\n\n00:08:45.398 --> 00:08:49.574\n\"I feel tremendous grief and rage\nthat I lost an essential,\n\n00:08:49.598 --> 00:08:53.454\nirreplaceable and formative\ntime with my son.\n\n00:08:53.478 --> 00:08:56.894\nLabor and delivery\nleft me feeling absolutely broken.\n\n00:08:56.918 --> 00:09:01.574\nFor months, all I remember\nis the screaming: colic, they said.\n\n00:09:01.598 --> 00:09:03.734\nOn the inside, I was drowning.\n\n00:09:03.758 --> 00:09:07.454\nEvery morning, I asked myself\nhow much longer I could do it.\n\n00:09:07.478 --> 00:09:10.654\nI was allowed to bring my baby to work.\n\n00:09:10.678 --> 00:09:13.814\nI closed my office door\nwhile I rocked and shushed\n\n00:09:13.838 --> 00:09:17.334\nand begged him to stop screaming\nso I wouldn't get in trouble.\n\n00:09:17.358 --> 00:09:19.414\nI hid behind that office door\nevery damn day\n\n00:09:19.438 --> 00:09:21.374\nand cried while he screamed.\n\n00:09:21.398 --> 00:09:25.054\nI cried in the bathroom\nwhile I washed out the pump equipment.\n\n00:09:25.078 --> 00:09:28.214\nEvery day, I cried all the way to work\nand all the way home again.\n\n00:09:28.238 --> 00:09:31.374\nI promised my boss that the work\nI didn't get done during the day,\n\n00:09:31.398 --> 00:09:33.054\nI'd make up at night from home.\n\n00:09:33.078 --> 00:09:36.878\nI thought, there's just something\nwrong with me that I can't swing this.\"\n\n00:09:38.478 --> 00:09:41.094\nSo those are the mothers.\n\n00:09:41.118 --> 00:09:42.894\nWhat of the babies?\n\n00:09:42.918 --> 00:09:45.414\nAs a country, do we care\nabout the millions of babies\n\n00:09:45.438 --> 00:09:47.294\nborn every year to working mothers?\n\n00:09:47.318 --> 00:09:48.654\nI say we don't,\n\n00:09:48.678 --> 00:09:52.134\nnot until they're of working\nand tax-paying and military-serving age.\n\n00:09:52.158 --> 00:09:54.063\nWe tell them we'll see them in 18 years,\n\n00:09:54.087 --> 00:09:55.849\nand getting there is kind of on them.\n\n00:09:57.812 --> 00:10:00.574\nOne of the reasons I know this\nis that babies whose mothers\n\n00:10:00.598 --> 00:10:02.894\nhave 12 or more weeks at home with them\n\n00:10:02.918 --> 00:10:06.894\nare more likely to get their vaccinations\nand their well checks in their first year,\n\n00:10:06.918 --> 00:10:11.614\nso those babies are more protected\nfrom deadly and disabling diseases.\n\n00:10:11.638 --> 00:10:14.878\nBut those things are hidden\nbehind images like this.\n\n00:10:18.238 --> 00:10:23.734\nAmerica has a message for new mothers\nwho work and for their babies.\n\n00:10:23.758 --> 00:10:27.534\nWhatever time you get together,\nyou should be grateful for it,\n\n00:10:27.558 --> 00:10:30.294\nand you're an inconvenience\n\n00:10:30.318 --> 00:10:33.334\nto the economy and to your employers.\n\n00:10:33.358 --> 00:10:37.894\nThat narrative of gratitude\nruns through a lot of the stories I hear.\n\n00:10:37.918 --> 00:10:39.574\nA woman told me,\n\n00:10:39.598 --> 00:10:41.774\n\"I went back at eight weeks\nafter my C-section\n\n00:10:41.798 --> 00:10:43.614\nbecause my husband was out of work.\n\n00:10:43.638 --> 00:10:46.374\nWithout me, my daughter\nhad failure to thrive.\n\n00:10:46.398 --> 00:10:47.694\nShe wouldn't take a bottle.\n\n00:10:47.718 --> 00:10:49.334\nShe started losing weight.\n\n00:10:49.358 --> 00:10:52.174\nThankfully, my manager\nwas very understanding.\n\n00:10:52.198 --> 00:10:53.734\nHe let my mom bring my

00:11:13.614\nThe first eight make up eight million\nin total population.\n\n00:11:13.638 --> 00:11:17.134\nThey are Papua New Guinea,\nSuriname and the tiny island nations\n\n00:11:17.158 -->

planet\n\n00:11:35.878 --> 00:11:39.774\nhas found a way to make some level\nof national paid leave work\n\n00:11:39.798 --> 00:11:42.774\nfor the people doing the work\nof the future of those

00:11:53.734\nand then we cheer when corporations\noffer even more paid leave to the women\n\n00:11:53.758 --> 00:11:57.014\nwho are already the highest-educated\nand highest-paid among us.\n\n00:11:57.038 --> 00:11:58.854\nRemember that 88 percent?\n\n00:11:58.878 --> 00:12:02.718\nThose middle- and low-income women\nare not going to participate in that.\n\n00:12:03.838 --> 00:12:09.294\nWe know that there are staggering\neconomic, financial, physical\n\n00:12:09.318 --> 00:12:11.854\nand emotional costs to this approach.\n\n00:12:11.878 --> 00:12:15.894\nWe have decided --\ndecided, not an accident,\n\n00:12:15.918 --> 00:12:19.854\nto pass these costs directly\non to working mothers and their babies.\n\n00:12:19.878 --> 00:12:22.534\nWe know the price tag is higher\nfor low-income women,\n\n00:12:22.558 --> 00:12:25.334\ntherefore disproportionately\nfor women of color.\n\n00:12:25.358 --> 00:12:27.814\nWe pass them on anyway.\n\n00:12:27.838 --> 00:12:30.454\nAll of this is to America's shame.\n\n00:12:30.478 --> 00:12:34.374\nBut it's also to America's risk.\n\n00:12:34.398 --> 00:12:36.294\nBecause what would happen\n\n00:12:36.318 --> 00:12:40.374\nif all of these individual\nso-called choices to have babies\n\n00:12:40.398 --> 00:12:44.398\nstarted to turn into individual choices\nnot to have babies.\n\n00:12:45.278 --> 00:12:46.974\nOne woman told me,\n\n00:12:46.998 --> 00:12:50.254\n\"New motherhood is hard.\nIt shouldn't be traumatic.\n\n00:12:50.278 --> 00:12:52.534\nWhen we talk about expanding\nour family

with our first,\n\n00:13:00.198 --> 00:13:01.838\nwe might stick with one kid.\"\n\n00:13:03.758 --> 00:13:06.654\nThe birthrate needed in America\nto keep the population stable\n\n00:13:06.678 -->

00:13:19.694\nand we are actively disincentivizing\nworking women from doing that.\n\n00:13:19.718 --> 00:13:22.934\nWhat would happen to work force,\nto innovation, to GDP,\n\n00:13:22.958 -->

00:13:35.134\nI'm here today with only\none idea worth spreading,\n\n00:13:35.158 --> 00:13:37.294\nand you've guessed what it is.\n\n00:13:37.318 --> 00:13:41.014\nIt is long since time\nfor the most powerful country on Earth\n\n00:13:41.038 --> 00:13:43.094\nto offer national paid leave\n\n00:13:43.118 --> 00:13:45.833\nto the people doing the work\nof the future of this country\n\n00:13:45.857

00:14:00.854\nIt should be able\nto be shared between partners.\n\n00:14:00.878 --> 00:14:02.854\nI've talked today a lot about mothers,\n\n00:14:02.878 --> 00:14:05.558\nbut co-parents matter on so

happening\nto a new family, it is consuming,\n\n00:14:45.398 --> 00:14:48.174\nand a family with a new baby\nis more financially vulnerable\n\n00:14:48.198 --> 00:14:49.654\nthan they've ever been

00:14:59.454\nI am done, done having babies,\n\n00:14:59.478 --> 00:15:01.334\nand you might be pre-baby,\n\n00:15:01.358 --> 00:15:02.734\nyou might be post-baby,\n\n00:15:02.758 -->

00:15:10.414\nor even a women's issue.\n\n00:15:10.438 --> 00:15:11.998\nThis is an American issue.\n\n00:15:14.158 --> 00:15:17.654\nWe need to stop buying the lie\nthat these images tell

00:15:25.934\nwhen we see it work\neverywhere all over the world.\n\n00:15:25.958 --> 00:15:29.734\nWe need to recognize\nthat this American reality\n\n00:15:29.758 --> 00:15:33.374\nis to our

That's largely true. Actually, I just needed to have a bit of help to come up to the stage.But there is also a lot that I can do. This is me rock climbing for the first time. Actually, I love sports and I can play many sports, like swimming, skiing, skating, scuba diving, running and so on. But there is one limitation: somebody needs to help me. I want to be independent.I lost my sight at the age of 14 in a swimming pool accident. I was an active, independent teenager, and suddenly I became blind. The hardest thing for me was losing my independence. Things that until then seemed simple became almost impossible to do alone. For example, one of my challenges was textbooks. Back then, there were no personal computers, no Internet, no smartphones. So I had to ask one of my two brothers to read me textbooks, and I had to create my own books in Braille. Can you imagine? Of course, my brothers were not happy about it, and later, I noticed they were not there whenever I needed them. (Laughter) I think they tried to stay away from me. I don't blame them. I really wanted to be freed from relying on someone. That became my strong desire to ignite innovation.Jump ahead to the mid-1980s. I got to know cutting-edge technologies and I thought to myself, how come there is no computer technology to create books in Braille? These amazing technologies must be able to also help people with limitations like myself. That's the moment my innovation journey began.I started developing digital book technologies, such as a digital Braille editor, digital Braille dictionary and a digital Braille library network. Today, every student who is visually impaired can read textbooks, by using personal computers and mobile devices, in Braille or in voice. This may not surprise you, since everyone now has digital books in their tablets in 2015. But Braille went digital many years before digital books, already in the late 1980s, almost 30 years ago. Strong and specific needs of the blind people made this opportunity to create digital books way back then. And this is actually not the first time this happened, because history shows us accessibility ignites innovation. The telephone was invented while developing a communication tool for hearing impaired people. Some keyboards were also invented to help people with disabilities.Now I'm going to give you another example from my own life. In the '90s, people around me started talking about the Internet and web browsing. I remember the first time I went on the web. I was astonished. I could access newspapers at any time and every day. I could even search for any information by myself. I desperately wanted to help the blind people have access to the Internet, and I found ways to render the web into synthesized voice, which dramatically simplified the user interface.This led me to develop the Home Page Reader in 1997, first in Japanese and later, translated into 11 languages. When I developed the Home Page Reader, I got many comments from users. One that I strongly remember said, \"For me, the Internet is a small window to the world.\"It was a revolutionary moment for the blind. The cyber world became accessible, and this technology that we created for the blind has many uses, way beyond what I imagined. It can help drivers listen to their emails or it can help you listen to a recipe while cooking.Today, I am more independent, but it is still not enough. For example, when I approached the stage just now, I needed assistance. My goal is to come up here independently. And not just here. My goal is to be able to travel and do things that are simple to you.OK, now let me show you the latest technologies. This is a smartphone app that we are working on.(Video) Electronic voice: 51 feet to the door, and keep straight.EV: Take the two doors to go out. The door is on your right.EV: Nick is approaching. Looks so happy. Chieko Asakawa: Hi, Nick!(Laughter) CA: Where are you going? You look so happy.Nick: Oh \u2014 well, my paper just got accepted. CA: That's great! Congratulations.Nick: Thanks. Wait \u2014 how'd you know it was me, and that I look happy? (Chieko and Nick laugh)Man: Hi. (Laughter) CA: Oh ... hi.EV: He is not talking to you, but on his phone.EV: Potato chips.EV: Dark chocolate with almonds.EV: You gained 5 pounds since yesterday; take apple instead of chocolate.(Laughter)EV: Approaching.EV: You arrived.CA: Now ...(Applause)Thank you.So now the app navigates me by analyzing beacon signals and smartphone sensors and permits me to move around indoor and outdoor environments all by myself. But the computer vision part that showed who is approaching, in which mood \u2014 we are still working on that part. And recognizing facial expressions is very important for me to be social.So now the fusions of technologies are ready to help me see the real world. We call this cognitive assistance. It understands our surrounding world and whispers to me in voice or sends a vibration to my fingers. Cognitive assistance will augment missing or weakened abilities \u2014 in other words, our five senses. This technology is only in an early stage, but eventually, I'll be able to find a classroom on campus, enjoy window shopping or find a nice restaurant while walking along a street. It will be amazing if I can find you on the street before you notice me. It will become my best buddy, and yours.So, this really is a great challenge. It is a challenge that needs collaboration, which is why we are creating an open community to accelerate research activities. Just this morning, we announced the open-source fundamental technologies you just saw in the video.The frontier is the real world. The blind community is exploring this technical frontier and the pathfinder. I hope to work with you to explore the new era, and the next time that I'm on this stage, through technology and innovation, I will be able to walk up here all by myself.Thank you so much.(Applause)",

newspapers\nat any time and every day.\n\n00:04:08.768 --> 00:04:12.624\nI could even search\nfor any information by myself.\n\n00:04:13.133 --> 00:04:18.947\nI desperately wanted to help the blind\npeople have access to the Internet,\n\n00:04:18.971 --> 00:04:24.277\nand I found ways to render the web\ninto synthesized voice,\n\n00:04:24.301 --> 00:04:28.071\nwhich dramatically simplified\nthe user interface.\n\n00:04:28.643 --> 00:04:34.053\nThis led me to develop\nthe Home Page Reader in 1997,\n\n00:04:34.077 --> 00:04:38.970\nfirst in Japanese and later,\ntranslated into 11 languages.\n\n00:04:39.742 --> 00:04:42.319\nWhen I developed the Home Page Reader,\n\n00:04:42.343 --> 00:04:45.272\nI got many comments from users.\n\n00:04:45.867 --> 00:04:48.393\nOne that I strongly remember said,\n\n00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:54.238\n\"For me, the Internet\nis a small window to the world.\"\n\n00:04:55.143 --> 00:04:58.084\nIt was a revolutionary moment\nfor the blind.\n\n00:04:59.088 --> 00:05:01.265\nThe cyber world became accessible,\n\n00:05:01.289 --> 00:05:05.959\nand this technology that we created\nfor the blind has many uses,\n\n00:05:05.983 --> 00:05:07.958\nway beyond what I imagined.\n\n00:05:08.497 --> 00:05:12.643\nIt can help drivers listen to their emails\n\n00:05:12.667 --> 00:05:16.940\nor it can help you listen\nto a recipe while

approached\nthe stage just now, I needed assistance.\n\n00:05:30.370 --> 00:05:33.791\nMy goal is to come up here independently.\n\n00:05:34.105 --> 00:05:35.632\nAnd not just here.\n\n00:05:35.949

National record attempt. 70 meters. [123 meters](Applause)(Video) Judge: White card. Guillaume N\u00e9ry! National record!Guillaume N\u00e9ry: Thank you.(Applause)Thank you very much, thanks for the warm welcome. That dive you just watched is a journey \u2014 a journey between two breaths. A journey that takes place between two breaths \u2014 the last one before diving into the water, and the first one, coming back to the surface. That dive is a journey to the very limits of human possibility, a journey into the unknown. But it's also, and above all, an inner journey, where a number of things happen, physiologically as well as mentally. And that's why I'm here today, to share my journey with you and to take you along with me.So, we start with the last breath. (Breathing in) (Breathing out) As you noticed, that last breath in is slow, deep and intense. It ends with a special technique called the carp, which allows me to store one to two extra liters of air in my lungs by compressing it. When I leave the surface, I have about 10 liters of air in my lungs. As soon as I leave the surface the first mechanism kicks in: the diving reflex. The first thing the diving reflex does is make your heart rate drop. My heart beat will drop from about 60-70 per minute to about 30-40 beats per minute in a matter of seconds; almost immediately.Next, the diving reflex causes peripheral vasoconstriction, which means that the blood flow will leave the body's extremities to feed the most important organs: the lungs, the heart and the brain. This mechanism is innate. I cannot control it. If you go underwater, even if you've never done it before, you'll experience the exact same effects. All human beings share this characteristic. And what's extraordinary is that we share this instinct with marine mammals \u2014 all marine mammals: dolphins, whales, sea lions, etc. When they dive deep into the ocean, these mechanisms become activated, but to a greater extent. And, of course, it works much better for them. It's absolutely fascinating.Right as I leave the surface, nature gives me a push in the right direction, allowing me to descend with confidence.So as I dive deeper into the blue, the pressure slowly starts to squeeze my lungs. And since it's the amount of air in my lungs that makes me float, the farther down I go, the more pressure there is on my lungs, the less air they contain and the easier it is for my body to fall. And at one point, around 35 or 40 meters down, I don't even need to swim. My body is dense and heavy enough to fall into the depths by itself, and I enter what's called the free fall phase. The free fall phase is the best part of the dive. It's the reason I still dive. Because it feels like you're being pulled down and you don't need to do anything. I can go from 35 meters to 123 meters without making a single movement. I let myself be pulled by the depths, and it feels like I'm flying underwater. It's truly an amazing feeling \u2014 an extraordinary feeling of freedom.And so I slowly continue sliding to the bottom. 40 meters down, 50 meters down, and between 50 and 60 meters, a second physiological response kicks in. My lungs reach residual volume, below which they're not supposed to be compressed, in theory. And this second response is called blood shift, or \"pulmonary erection\" in French. I prefer \"blood shift.\"(Laughter)So blood shift \u2014 how does it work? The capillaries in the lungs become engorged with blood \u2014 which is caused by the suction \u2014 so the lungs can harden and protect the whole chest cavity from being crushed. It prevents the two walls of the lungs from collapsing, from sticking together and caving in. Thanks to this phenomenon, which we also share with marine mammals, I'm able to continue with my dive.60, 70 meters down, I keep falling, faster and faster, because the pressure is crushing my body more and more. Below 80 meters, the pressure becomes a lot stronger, and I start to feel it physically. I really start to feel the suffocation. You can see what it looks like \u2014 not pretty at all. The diaphragm is completely collapsed, the rib cage is squeezed in, and mentally, there is something going on as well.You may be thinking, \"This doesn't look enjoyable. How do you do it?\" If I relied on my earthly reflexes \u2014 what do we do above water when there's a problem? We resist, we go against it. We fight. Underwater, that doesn't work. If you try that underwater, you might tear your lungs, spit up blood, develop an edema and you'll have to stop diving for a good amount of time. So what you need to do, mentally, is to tell yourself that nature and the elements are stronger than you.And so I let the water crush me. I accept the pressure and go with it. At this point, my body receives this information, and my lungs start relaxing. I relinquish all control, and relax completely. The pressure starts crushing me, and it doesn't feel bad at all. I even feel like I'm in a cocoon, protected.And the dive continues. 80, 85 meters down, 90, 100. 100 meters \u2014 the magic number. In every sport, it's a magic number. For swimmers and athletes and also for us, free divers, it's a number everyone dreams of. Everyone wishes one day to be able to get to 100 meters. And it's a symbolic number for us, because in the 1970s, doctors and physiologists did their math, and predicted that the human body would not be able to go below 100 meters. Below that, they said, the human body would implode. And then the Frenchman, Jacques Mayol \u2014 you all know him as the hero in \"The Big Blue\" \u2014 came along and dived down to 100 meters. He even reached 105 meters. At that time, he was doing \"no limits.\" He'd use weights to descend faster and come back up with a balloon, just like in the movie. Today, we go down 200 meters in no limit free diving. I can do 123 meters by simply using muscle strength. And in a way, it's all thanks to him, because he challenged known facts, and with a sweep of his hand, got rid of the theoretical beliefs and all the mental limits that we like to impose on ourselves. He showed us that the human body has an infinite ability to adapt.So I carry on with my dive. 105, 110, 115. The bottom is getting closer. 120, 123 meters. I'm at the bottom.And now, I'd like to ask you to join me and put yourself in my place. Close your eyes. Imagine you get to 123 meters. The surface is far, far away. You're alone. There's hardly any light. It's cold \u2014 freezing cold. The pressure is crushing you completely \u2014 13 times stronger than on the surface. And I know what you're thinking: \"This is horrible. What the hell am I doing here? He's insane.\" But no. That's not what I think when I'm down there. When I'm at the bottom, I feel good. I get this extraordinary feeling of well-being. Maybe it's because I've completely released all tensions and let myself go. I feel great, without the need to breathe.Although, you'd agree, I should be worried. I feel like a tiny dot, a little drop of water, floating in the middle of the ocean. And each time, I picture the same image. [The Pale Blue Dot] It's that small dot the arrow is pointing to. Do you know what it is? It's planet Earth. Planet Earth, photographed by the Voyager probe, from 4 billion kilometers away. And it shows that our home is that small dot over there, floating in the middle of nothing.That's how I feel when I'm at the bottom, at 123 meters. I feel like a small dot, a speck of dust, stardust, floating in the middle of the cosmos, in the middle of nothing, in the immensity of space. It's a fascinating sensation, because when I look up, down, left, right, in front, behind, I see the same thing: the infinite deep blue. Nowhere else on Earth you can experience this \u2014 looking all around you, and seeing the same thing. It's extraordinary. And at that moment, I still get that feeling each time, building up inside of me \u2014 the feeling of humility.Looking at this picture, I feel very humble \u2014 just like when I'm all the way down at the bottom \u2014 because I'm nothing, I'm a little speck of nothingness lost in all of time and space. And it still is absolutely fascinating. I decide to go back to the surface, because this is not where I belong. I belong up there, on the surface.So I start heading back up. I get something of a shock at the very moment when I decide to go up. First, because it takes a huge effort to tear yourself away from the bottom. It pulled you down on the way in, and will do the same on the way up. You have to swim twice as hard. Then, I'm hit with another phenomenon known as narcosis. I don't know if you've heard of that. It's called nitrogen narcosis. It's something that happens to scuba divers, but it can happen to free divers. It's caused by nitrogen dissolving in the blood, which causes confusion between the conscious and unconscious mind. A flurry of thoughts goes spinning through your head. You can't control them, and you shouldn't try to \u2014 you have to let it happen. The more you try to control it, the harder it is to manage. Then, a third thing happens: the desire to breathe. I'm not a fish, I'm a human being, and the desire to breathe reminds me of that fact. Around 60, 70 meters, you start to feel the need to breathe. And with everything else that's going on, you can very easily lose your ground and start to panic. When that happens, you think, \"Where's the surface? I want to go up. I want to breathe now.\" You should not do that. Never look up to the surface \u2014 not with your eyes, or your mind. You should never picture yourself up there. You have to stay in the present. I look at the rope right in front of me, leading me back to the surface. And I focus on that, on the present moment. Because if I think about the surface, I panic. And if I panic, it's over. Time goes faster this way.And at 30 meters: deliverance. I'm not alone any more. The safety divers, my guardian angels, join me. They leave the surface, we meet at 30 meters, and they escort me for the final few meters, where potential problems could arise. Every time I see them, I think to myself, \"It's thanks to you.\" It's thanks to them, my team, that I'm here. It brings back the sense of humility. Without my team, without all the people around me, the adventure into the deep would be impossible. A journey into the deep is above all a group effort.So I'm happy to finish my journey with them, because I wouldn't be here if it weren't for them. 20 meters, 10 meters, my lungs slowly return to their normal volume. Buoyancy pushes me up to the surface. Five meters below the surface, I start to breathe out, so that as soon as I get to the surface all I do is breathe in. And so I arrive at the surface. (Breathing in) Air floods into my lungs. It's like being born again, a relief. It feels good. Though the journey was extraordinary, I do need to feel those small oxygen molecules fueling my body. It's an extraordinary sensation, but at the same time it's traumatizing. It's a shock to the system, as you can you imagine. I go from complete darkness to the light of day, from the near-silence of the depths to the commotion up top. In terms of touch, I go from the soft, velvety feeling of the water, to air rubbing across my face. In terms of smell, there is air rushing into my lungs.And in return, my lungs open up. They were completely squashed just 90 seconds ago, and now, they've opened up again. So all of this affects quite a lot of things. I need a few seconds to come back, and to feel \"all there\" again. But that needs to happen quickly, because the judges are there to verify my performance; I need to show them I'm in perfect physical condition. You saw in the video, I was doing a so-called exit protocol. Once at the surface, I have 15 seconds to take off my nose clip, give this signal and say (English) \"I am OK.\" Plus, you need to be bilingual.(Laughter)On top of everything \u2014 that's not very nice. Once the protocol is completed, the judges show me a white card, and that's when the joy starts. I can finally celebrate what has just happened.So, the journey I've just described to you is a more extreme version of free diving. Luckily, it's far from just that. For the past few years, I've been trying to show another side of free diving, because the media mainly talks about competitions and records. But free diving is more than just that. It's about being at ease in the water. It's extremely beautiful, very poetic and artistic.So my wife and I decided to film it and try to show another side of it, mostly to make people want to go into the water. Let me show you some images to finish my story. It's a mix of beautiful underwater photos.(Music)I'd like you to know that if one day you try to stop breathing, you'll realize that when you stop breathing, you stop thinking, too. It calms your mind.Today, in the 21st century, we're under so much pressure. Our minds are overworked, we think at a million miles an hour, we're always stressed. Being able to free dive lets you, just for a moment, relax your mind. Holding your breath underwater means giving yourself the chance to experience weightlessness. It means being underwater, floating, with your body completely relaxed, letting go of all your tensions. This is our plight in the 21st century: our backs hurt, our necks hurt, everything hurts, because we're stressed and tense all the time. But when you're in the water, you let yourself float, as if you were in space. You let yourself go completely. It's an extraordinary feeling. You can finally get in touch with your body, mind and spirit. Everything feels better, all at once.Learning how to free dive is also about learning to breathe correctly. We breathe with our first breath at birth, up until our last one. Breathing gives rhythm to our lives. Learning how to breathe better is learning how to live better. Holding your breath in the sea, not necessarily at 100 meters, but maybe at two or three, putting on your goggles, a pair of flippers, means you can go see another world, another universe, completely magical. You can see little fish, seaweed, the flora and fauna, you can watch it all discreetly, sliding underwater, looking around, and coming back to the surface, leaving no trace. It's an amazing feeling to become one with nature like that.And if I may say one more thing, holding your breath, being in the water, finding this underwater world \u2014 it's all about connecting with yourself. You heard me talk a lot about the body's memory that dates back millions of years, to our marine origins.

warm welcome.\n\n00:02:37.376 --> 00:02:40.580\nThat dive you just watched is a journey --\n\n00:02:40.604 --> 00:02:42.818\na journey between two breaths.\n\n00:02:43.325 --> 00:02:45.620\nA journey that takes place\nbetween two breaths --\n\n00:02:45.644 --> 00:02:47.898\nthe last one before diving into the water,\n\n00:02:47.922 --> 00:02:50.752\nand the first one,\ncoming back to the surface.\n\n00:02:51.352 --> 00:02:55.726\nThat dive is a journey\nto the very limits of human possibility,\n\n00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:57.686\na journey into the unknown.\n\n00:02:58.273 --> 00:03:01.804\nBut it's also, and above all,\nan inner journey,\n\n00:03:01.828 --> 00:03:04.222\nwhere a number of things happen,\n\n00:03:04.246 --> 00:03:06.575\nphysiologically as well as mentally.\n\n00:03:06.599 --> 00:03:08.615\nAnd that's why I'm here today,\n\n00:03:08.639 --> 00:03:11.972\nto share my journey with you\nand to take you along with me.\n\n00:03:11.996 --> 00:03:14.461\nSo, we start with the last breath.\n\n00:03:15.945 --> 00:03:19.020\n(Breathing in)\n\n00:03:29.237 --> 00:03:31.077\n(Breathing out)\n\n00:03:31.101 --> 00:03:35.544\nAs you noticed, that last breath\nin is slow, deep and intense.\n\n00:03:35.568 --> 00:03:38.124\nIt ends with a special technique\ncalled the carp,\n\n00:03:38.148 --> 00:03:41.789\nwhich allows me to store one to two\nextra liters of air in my lungs\n\n00:03:41.813 --> 00:03:43.926\nby compressing it.\n\n00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:48.545\nWhen I leave the surface,\nI have about 10 liters of air in my lungs.\n\n00:03:49.497 --> 00:03:53.018\nAs soon as I leave the surface\nthe first mechanism kicks in:\n\n00:03:53.042 --> 00:03:54.478\nthe diving reflex.\n\n00:03:54.502 --> 00:03:59.386\nThe first thing the diving reflex does\nis make your heart rate drop.\n\n00:03:59.410 --> 00:04:02.243\nMy heart beat will drop\nfrom about 60-70 per minute\n\n00:04:02.267 --> 00:04:04.047\nto about 30-40 beats per minute\n\n00:04:04.071 --> 00:04:06.992\nin a matter of seconds;\nalmost immediately.\n\n00:04:07.016 --> 00:04:10.105\nNext, the diving reflex causes\nperipheral vasoconstriction,\n\n00:04:10.129 --> 00:04:14.299\nwhich means that the blood flow\nwill leave the body's extremities\n\n00:04:14.323 --> 00:04:17.667\nto feed the most important organs:\n\n00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:21.761\nthe lungs, the heart and the brain.\n\n00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:26.044\nThis mechanism is innate.\n\n00:04:26.068 --> 00:04:27.484\nI cannot control it.\n\n00:04:27.508 --> 00:04:30.300\nIf you go underwater,\neven if you've never done it before,\n\n00:04:30.324 --> 00:04:32.669\nyou'll experience the exact same effects.\n\n00:04:32.693 --> 00:04:36.316\nAll human beings\nshare this characteristic.\n\n00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:38.266\nAnd what's extraordinary\n\n00:04:38.290 --> 00:04:41.807\nis that we share this instinct\nwith marine mammals --\n\n00:04:41.831 --> 00:04:45.489\nall marine mammals:\ndolphins, whales, sea lions, etc.\n\n00:04:45.513 --> 00:04:50.109\nWhen they dive deep into the ocean,\nthese mechanisms become activated,\n\n00:04:50.133 --> 00:04:51.466\nbut to a greater extent.\n\n00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:54.013\nAnd, of course, it works\nmuch better for them.\n\n00:04:55.928 --> 00:04:57.322\nIt's absolutely fascinating.\n\n00:04:57.346 --> 00:04:58.772\nRight as I leave the surface,\n\n00:04:58.796 --> 00:05:01.105\nnature gives me a push\nin the right direction,\n\n00:05:01.129 --> 00:05:03.521\nallowing me to descend with confidence.\n\n00:05:03.545 --> 00:05:05.561\nSo as I dive deeper into the blue,\n\n00:05:05.585 --> 00:05:09.577\nthe pressure slowly starts\nto squeeze my lungs.\n\n00:05:10.296 --> 00:05:13.547\nAnd since it's the amount of air\nin my lungs that makes me float,\n\n00:05:13.571 --> 00:05:16.499\nthe farther down I go,\nthe more pressure there is on my lungs,\n\n00:05:16.523 --> 00:05:20.126\nthe less air they contain\nand the easier it is for my body to fall.\n\n00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:22.953\nAnd at one point,\naround 35 or 40 meters down,\n\n00:05:22.977 --> 00:05:25.666\nI don't even need to swim.\n\n00:05:26.426 --> 00:05:31.197\nMy body is dense and heavy enough\nto fall into the depths by itself,\n\n00:05:31.221 --> 00:05:33.816\nand I enter what's called\nthe free fall phase.\n\n00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:36.562\nThe free fall phase\nis the best part of the dive.\n\n00:05:36.586 --> 00:05:38.464\nIt's the reason I still dive.\n\n00:05:38.488 --> 00:05:42.448\nBecause it feels like\nyou're being pulled down\n\n00:05:43.359 --> 00:05:45.056\nand you don't need to do anything.\n\n00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:48.974\nI can go from 35 meters to 123 meters\nwithout making a single movement.\n\n00:05:48.998 --> 00:05:50.940\nI let myself be pulled by the depths,\n\n00:05:50.964 --> 00:05:52.902\nand it feels like I'm flying underwater.\n\n00:05:52.926 --> 00:05:56.909\nIt's truly an amazing feeling --\nan extraordinary feeling of freedom.\n\n00:05:56.933 --> 00:05:59.916\nAnd so I slowly continue\nsliding to the bottom.\n\n00:05:59.940 --> 00:06:01.220\n40 meters down,\n\n00:06:01.244 --> 00:06:02.541\n50 meters down,\n\n00:06:02.565 --> 00:06:06.792\nand between 50 and 60 meters,\na second physiological response kicks in.\n\n00:06:07.660 --> 00:06:10.176\nMy lungs reach residual volume,\n\n00:06:10.200 --> 00:06:15.139\nbelow which they're not supposed\nto be compressed, in theory.\n\n00:06:15.163 --> 00:06:18.689\nAnd this second response\nis called blood shift,\n\n00:06:18.713 --> 00:06:21.316\nor \"pulmonary erection\" in French.\n\n00:06:22.194 --> 00:06:23.503\nI prefer \"blood shift.\"\n\n00:06:23.527 --> 00:06:24.684\n(Laughter)\n\n00:06:24.708 --> 00:06:27.453\nSo blood shift -- how does it work?\n\n00:06:27.477 --> 00:06:32.051\nThe capillaries in the lungs\nbecome engorged with blood --\n\n00:06:32.075 --> 00:06:33.668\nwhich is caused by the suction --\n\n00:06:33.692 --> 00:06:35.403\nso the lungs can harden\n\n00:06:35.427 --> 00:06:38.099\nand protect the whole chest cavity\nfrom being crushed.\n\n00:06:38.123 --> 00:06:42.026\nIt prevents the two walls\nof the lungs from collapsing,\n\n00:06:42.050 --> 00:06:44.012\nfrom sticking together and caving in.\n\n00:06:44.036 --> 00:06:47.925\nThanks to this phenomenon,\nwhich we also share with marine mammals,\n\n00:06:47.949 --> 00:06:49.652\nI'm able to continue with my dive.\n\n00:06:49.676 --> 00:06:53.252\n60, 70 meters down,\nI keep falling, faster and faster,\n\n00:06:53.276 --> 00:06:56.188\nbecause the pressure is crushing\nmy body more and more.\n\n00:06:56.212 --> 00:06:57.735\nBelow 80 meters,\n\n00:06:58.313 --> 00:07:00.328\nthe pressure becomes a lot stronger,\n\n00:07:00.352 --> 00:07:02.423\nand I start to feel it physically.\n\n00:07:02.447 --> 00:07:04.452\nI really start to feel the suffocation.\n\n00:07:04.476 --> 00:07:06.936\nYou can see what it looks like --\nnot pretty at all.\n\n00:07:06.960 --> 00:07:11.198\nThe diaphragm is completely collapsed,\nthe rib cage is squeezed in,\n\n00:07:11.782 --> 00:07:14.265\nand mentally, there is something\ngoing on as well.\n\n00:07:14.289 --> 00:07:17.056\nYou may be thinking,\n\"This doesn't look enjoyable.\n\n00:07:17.080 --> 00:07:18.379\nHow do you do it?\"\n\n00:07:18.403 --> 00:07:20.204\nIf I relied on my earthly reflexes --\n\n00:07:20.228 --> 00:07:23.691\nwhat do we do above water\nwhen there's a problem?\n\n00:07:23.715 --> 00:07:25.924\nWe resist, we go against it.\n\n00:07:25.948 --> 00:07:27.291\nWe fight.\n\n00:07:27.315 --> 00:07:28.847\nUnderwater, that doesn't work.\n\n00:07:28.871 --> 00:07:31.463\nIf you try that underwater,\nyou might tear your lungs,\n\n00:07:31.487 --> 00:07:33.053\nspit up blood, develop an edema\n\n00:07:33.077 --> 00:07:36.212\nand you'll have to stop diving\nfor a good amount of time.\n\n00:07:36.236 --> 00:07:39.410\nSo what you need to do, mentally,\nis to tell yourself\n\n00:07:39.434 --> 00:07:42.204\nthat nature and the elements\nare stronger than you.\n\n00:07:42.228 --> 00:07:44.854\nAnd so I let the water crush me.\n\n00:07:44.878 --> 00:07:47.726\nI accept the pressure and go with it.\n\n00:07:48.439 --> 00:07:50.783\nAt this point, my body\nreceives this information,\n\n00:07:50.807 --> 00:07:52.665\nand my lungs start relaxing.\n\n00:07:52.689 --> 00:07:55.832\nI relinquish all control,\nand relax completely.\n\n00:07:55.856 --> 00:07:59.706\nThe pressure starts crushing me,\nand it doesn't feel bad at all.\n\n00:07:59.730 --> 00:08:03.040\nI even feel like\nI'm in a cocoon, protected.\n\n00:08:03.064 --> 00:08:05.636\nAnd the dive continues.\n\n00:08:05.660 --> 00:08:07.358\n80, 85 meters down,\n\n00:08:07.382 --> 00:08:08.601\n90,\n\n00:08:08.625 --> 00:08:09.808\n100.\n\n00:08:09.832 --> 00:08:12.418\n100 meters -- the magic number.\n\n00:08:12.982 --> 00:08:14.844\nIn every sport, it's a magic number.\n\n00:08:14.868 --> 00:08:17.698\nFor swimmers and athletes\nand also for us, free divers,\n\n00:08:17.722 --> 00:08:19.368\nit's a number everyone dreams of.\n\n00:08:19.392 --> 00:08:22.790\nEveryone wishes one day\nto be able to get to 100 meters.\n\n00:08:22.814 --> 00:08:24.599\nAnd it's a symbolic number for us,\n\n00:08:24.623 --> 00:08:28.490\nbecause in the 1970s,\ndoctors and physiologists did their math,\n\n00:08:28.514 --> 00:08:33.823\nand predicted that the human body\nwould not be able to go below 100 meters.\n\n00:08:33.847 --> 00:08:36.703\nBelow that, they said,\nthe human body would implode.\n\n00:08:36.727 --> 00:08:38.839\nAnd then the Frenchman, Jacques Mayol --\n\n00:08:38.863 --> 00:08:41.156\nyou all know him as the hero\nin \"The Big Blue\" --\n\n00:08:41.180 --> 00:08:44.433\ncame along and dived down to 100 meters.\n\n00:08:44.457 --> 00:08:46.022\nHe even reached 105 meters.\n\n00:08:46.046 --> 00:08:47.942\nAt that time, he was doing \"no limits.\"\n\n00:08:47.966 --> 00:08:51.315\nHe'd use weights to descend faster\nand come back up with a balloon,\n\n00:08:51.339 --> 00:08:52.511\njust like in the movie.\n\n00:08:52.535 --> 00:08:55.113\nToday, we go down 200 meters\nin no limit free diving.\n\n00:08:55.137 --> 00:08:57.993\nI can do 123 meters\nby simply using muscle strength.\n\n00:08:58.017 --> 00:09:01.748\nAnd in a way, it's all thanks to him,\nbecause he challenged known facts,\n\n00:09:01.772 --> 00:09:06.139\nand with a sweep of his hand,\ngot rid of the theoretical beliefs\n\n00:09:06.163 --> 00:09:09.564\nand all the mental limits\nthat we like to impose on ourselves.\n\n00:09:09.588 --> 00:09:13.204\nHe showed us that the human body\nhas an infinite ability to adapt.\n\n00:09:13.228 --> 00:09:14.947\nSo I carry on with my dive.\n\n00:09:14.971 --> 00:09:17.105\n105, 110, 115.\n\n00:09:17.129 --> 00:09:18.899\nThe bottom is getting closer.\n\n00:09:18.923 --> 00:09:20.399\n120,\n\n00:09:20.423 --> 00:09:21.613\n123 meters.\n\n00:09:21.637 --> 00:09:22.916\nI'm at the bottom.\n\n00:09:22.940 --> 00:09:26.550\nAnd now, I'd like to ask you to join me\nand put yourself in my place.\n\n00:09:26.574 --> 00:09:28.209\nClose your eyes.\n\n00:09:28.710 --> 00:09:31.479\nImagine you get to 123 meters.\n\n00:09:33.499 --> 00:09:36.083\nThe surface is far, far away.\n\n00:09:36.678 --> 00:09:38.134\nYou're alone.\n\n00:09:39.822 --> 00:09:41.579\nThere's hardly any light.\n\n00:09:42.282 --> 00:09:43.537\nIt's cold --\n\n00:09:43.561 --> 00:09:44.918\nfreezing cold.\n\n00:09:44.942 --> 00:09:46.995\nThe pressure is crushing you completely --\n\n00:09:47.019 --> 00:09:49.105\n13 times stronger than on the surface.\n\n00:09:50.172 --> 00:09:52.081\nAnd I know what you're thinking:\n\n00:09:52.105 --> 00:09:54.054\n\"This is horrible.\n\n00:09:54.078 --> 00:09:55.934\nWhat the hell am I doing here?\n\n00:09:55.958 --> 00:09:57.648\nHe's insane.\"\n\n00:09:58.442 --> 00:09:59.608\nBut no.\n\n00:09:59.989 --> 00:10:02.249\nThat's not what I think\nwhen I'm down there.\n\n00:10:02.273 --> 00:10:03.998\nWhen I'm at the bottom, I feel good.\n\n00:10:04.022 --> 00:10:06.279\nI get this extraordinary\nfeeling of well-being.\n\n00:10:06.303 --> 00:10:09.192\nMaybe it's because I've completely\nreleased all tensions\n\n00:10:09.216 --> 00:10:10.937\nand let myself go.\n\n00:10:10.961 --> 00:10:14.422\nI feel great, without the need to breathe.\n\n00:10:17.196 --> 00:10:21.156\nAlthough, you'd agree,\nI should be worried.\n\n00:10:21.957 --> 00:10:24.280\nI feel like a tiny dot,\na little drop of water,\n\n00:10:24.304 --> 00:10:26.154\nfloating in the middle of the ocean.\n\n00:10:26.178 --> 00:10:28.813\nAnd each time, I picture the same image.\n\n00:10:29.694 --> 00:10:32.003\n[The Pale Blue Dot]\n\n00:10:32.431 --> 00:10:34.885\nIt's that small dot\nthe arrow is pointing to.\n\n00:10:34.909 --> 00:10:36.431\nDo you know what it is?\n\n00:10:37.438 --> 00:10:38.828\nIt's planet Earth.\n\n00:10:39.436 --> 00:10:42.097\nPlanet Earth, photographed\nby the Voyager probe,\n\n00:10:42.121 --> 00:10:44.273\nfrom 4 billion kilometers away.\n\n00:10:44.297 --> 00:10:48.393\nAnd it shows that our home\nis that small dot over there,\n\n00:10:48.417 --> 00:10:50.060\nfloating in the middle of nothing.\n\n00:10:50.084 --> 00:10:52.005\nThat's how I feel\n\n00:10:52.029 --> 00:10:54.180\nwhen I'm at the bottom, at 123 meters.\n\n00:10:54.204 --> 00:10:55.919\nI feel like a small dot,\n\n00:10:55.943 --> 00:10:58.498\na speck of dust, stardust,\n\n00:10:58.522 --> 00:11:00.737\nfloating in the middle of the cosmos,\n\n00:11:00.761 --> 00:11:03.205\nin the middle of nothing,\nin the immensity of space.\n\n00:11:03.229 --> 00:11:04.670\nIt's a fascinating sensation,\n\n00:11:04.694 --> 00:11:08.749\nbecause when I look up, down,\nleft, right, in front, behind,\n\n00:11:08.773 --> 00:11:11.964\nI see the same thing:\nthe infinite deep blue.\n\n00:11:11.988 --> 00:11:15.004\nNowhere else on Earth\nyou can experience this --\n\n00:11:15.028 --> 00:11:18.591\nlooking all around you,\nand seeing the same thing.\n\n00:11:18.615 --> 00:11:19.865\nIt's extraordinary.\n\n00:11:20.520 --> 00:11:21.960\nAnd at that moment,\n\n00:11:21.984 --> 00:11:24.985\nI still get that feeling each time,\nbuilding up inside of me --\n\n00:11:25.009 --> 00:11:27.531\nthe feeling of humility.\n\n00:11:28.833 --> 00:11:31.739\nLooking at this picture,\nI feel very humble --\n\n00:11:31.763 --> 00:11:34.294\njust like when I'm all the way\ndown at the bottom --\n\n00:11:34.318 --> 00:11:35.595\nbecause I'm nothing,\n\n00:11:35.619 --> 00:11:38.944\nI'm a little speck of nothingness\nlost in all of time and space.\n\n00:11:39.610 --> 00:11:41.927\nAnd it still is absolutely fascinating.\n\n00:11:42.618 --> 00:11:46.421\nI decide to go back to the surface,\nbecause this is not where I belong.\n\n00:11:46.445 --> 00:11:48.674\nI belong up there, on the surface.\n\n00:11:48.698 --> 00:11:50.875\nSo I start heading back up.\n\n00:11:51.976 --> 00:11:56.227\nI get something of a shock\n\n00:11:56.251 --> 00:11:58.714\nat the very moment when I decide to go up.\n\n00:11:58.738 --> 00:12:02.645\nFirst, because it takes a huge effort\nto tear yourself away from the bottom.\n\n00:12:02.669 --> 00:12:05.149\nIt pulled you down on the way in,\n\n00:12:05.173 --> 00:12:07.056\nand will do the same on the way up.\n\n00:12:07.080 --> 00:12:08.895\nYou have to swim twice as hard.\n\n00:12:10.438 --> 00:12:13.466\nThen, I'm hit with another\nphenomenon known as narcosis.\n\n00:12:13.480 --> 00:12:15.252\nI don't know if you've heard of that.\n\n00:12:15.276 --> 00:12:17.403\nIt's called nitrogen narcosis.\n\n00:12:17.427 --> 00:12:19.564\nIt's something that happens\nto scuba divers,\n\n00:12:19.588 --> 00:12:21.207\nbut it can happen to free divers.\n\n00:12:21.231 --> 00:12:24.760\nIt's caused by nitrogen\ndissolving in the blood,\n\n00:12:24.784 --> 00:12:26.678\nwhich causes confusion\n\n00:12:26.702 --> 00:12:29.305\nbetween the conscious\nand unconscious mind.\n\n00:12:30.170 --> 00:12:34.377\nA flurry of thoughts goes spinning\nthrough your head.\n\n00:12:34.401 --> 00:12:37.397\nYou can't control them,\nand you shouldn't try to --\n\n00:12:37.421 --> 00:12:39.005\nyou have to let it happen.\n\n00:12:39.029 --> 00:12:42.736\nThe more you try to control it,\nthe harder it is to manage.\n\n00:12:43.181 --> 00:12:44.649\nThen, a third thing happens:\n\n00:12:44.673 --> 00:12:45.942\nthe desire to breathe.\n\n00:12:45.966 --> 00:12:48.276\nI'm not a fish, I'm a human being,\n\n00:12:48.300 --> 00:12:51.821\nand the desire to breathe\nreminds me of that fact.\n\n00:12:51.845 --> 00:12:53.709\nAround 60, 70 meters,\n\n00:12:55.509 --> 00:12:57.762\nyou start to feel the need to breathe.\n\n00:12:59.608 --> 00:13:02.044\nAnd with everything else that's going on,\n\n00:13:02.068 --> 00:13:05.005\nyou can very easily lose your ground\n\n00:13:05.029 --> 00:13:06.568\nand start to panic.\n\n00:13:07.829 --> 00:13:10.250\nWhen that happens, you think,\n\"Where's the surface?\n\n00:13:10.274 --> 00:13:12.209\nI want to go up. I want to breathe now.\"\n\n00:13:12.233 --> 00:13:13.865\nYou should not do that.\n\n00:13:13.889 --> 00:13:15.723\nNever look up to the surface --\n\n00:13:15.747 --> 00:13:18.376\nnot with your eyes, or your mind.\n\n00:13:19.119 --> 00:13:21.848\nYou should never\npicture yourself up there.\n\n00:13:21.872 --> 00:13:23.510\nYou have to stay in the present.\n\n00:13:23.534 --> 00:13:28.356\nI look at the rope right in front of me,\nleading me back to the surface.\n\n00:13:28.792 --> 00:13:31.302\nAnd I focus on that,\non the present moment.\n\n00:13:31.787 --> 00:13:33.963\nBecause if I think\nabout the surface, I panic.\n\n00:13:33.987 --> 00:13:35.676\nAnd if I panic, it's over.\n\n00:13:36.883 --> 00:13:39.094\nTime goes faster this way.\n\n00:13:39.118 --> 00:13:41.213\nAnd at 30 meters: deliverance.\n\n00:13:41.237 --> 00:13:42.641\nI'm not alone any more.\n\n00:13:42.665 --> 00:13:46.064\nThe safety divers,\nmy guardian angels, join me.\n\n00:13:46.088 --> 00:13:48.411\nThey leave the surface,\nwe meet at 30 meters,\n\n00:13:48.435 --> 00:13:50.589\nand they escort me\nfor the final few meters,\n\n00:13:50.613 --> 00:13:53.289\nwhere potential problems could arise.\n\n00:13:53.839 --> 00:13:56.184\nEvery time I see them, I think to myself,\n\n00:13:57.211 --> 00:13:58.799\n\"It's thanks to you.\"\n\n00:13:58.823 --> 00:14:00.919\nIt's thanks to them,\nmy team, that I'm here.\n\n00:14:00.943 --> 00:14:03.124\nIt brings back the sense of humility.\n\n00:14:03.569 --> 00:14:07.014\nWithout my team, without all\nthe people around me,\n\n00:14:07.038 --> 00:14:09.393\nthe adventure into the deep\nwould be impossible.\n\n00:14:09.417 --> 00:14:12.645\nA journey into the deep\nis above all a group effort.\n\n00:14:13.317 --> 00:14:15.575\nSo I'm happy to finish\nmy journey with them,\n\n00:14:15.599 --> 00:14:18.093\nbecause I wouldn't be here\nif it weren't for them.\n\n00:14:18.117 --> 00:14:19.708\n20 meters, 10 meters,\n\n00:14:19.732 --> 00:14:21.979\nmy lungs slowly return\nto their normal volume.\n\n00:14:22.003 --> 00:14:24.350\nBuoyancy pushes me up to the surface.\n\n00:14:24.374 --> 00:14:27.922\nFive meters below the surface,\nI start to breathe out,\n\n00:14:27.946 --> 00:14:31.211\nso that as soon as I get\nto the surface all I do is breathe in.\n\n00:14:31.235 --> 00:14:33.200\nAnd so I arrive at the surface.\n\n00:14:33.502 --> 00:14:36.427\n(Breathing in)\n\n00:14:39.625 --> 00:14:41.619\nAir floods into my lungs.\n\n00:14:41.643 --> 00:14:44.031\nIt's like being born again, a relief.\n\n00:14:44.854 --> 00:14:46.009\nIt feels good.\n\n00:14:46.033 --> 00:14:47.899\nThough the journey was extraordinary,\n\n00:14:47.923 --> 00:14:51.875\nI do need to feel those small\noxygen molecules fueling my body.\n\n00:14:52.343 --> 00:14:55.928\nIt's an extraordinary sensation,\nbut at the same time it's traumatizing.\n\n00:14:55.952 --> 00:14:58.349\nIt's a shock to the system,\nas you can you imagine.\n\n00:14:58.373 --> 00:15:01.146\nI go from complete darkness\nto the light of day,\n\n00:15:01.170 --> 00:15:05.392\nfrom the near-silence of the depths\nto the commotion up top.\n\n00:15:06.346 --> 00:15:10.879\nIn terms of touch, I go from the soft,\nvelvety feeling of the water,\n\n00:15:10.903 --> 00:15:13.205\nto air rubbing across my face.\n\n00:15:13.229 --> 00:15:16.206\nIn terms of smell,\n\n00:15:16.230 --> 00:15:18.866\nthere is air rushing into my lungs.\n\n00:15:18.890 --> 00:15:21.302\nAnd in return, my lungs open up.\n\n00:15:21.326 --> 00:15:23.869\nThey were completely squashed\njust 90 seconds ago,\n\n00:15:23.893 --> 00:15:25.581\nand now, they've opened up again.\n\n00:15:25.605 --> 00:15:29.441\nSo all of this affects\nquite a lot of things.\n\n00:15:29.465 --> 00:15:31.785\nI need a few seconds to come back,\n\n00:15:31.809 --> 00:15:33.388\nand to feel \"all there\" again.\n\n00:15:33.412 --> 00:15:34.994\nBut that needs to happen quickly,\n\n00:15:35.018 --> 00:15:38.130\nbecause the judges are there\nto verify my performance;\n\n00:15:38.154 --> 00:15:40.739\nI need to show them\nI'm in perfect physical condition.\n\n00:15:40.763 --> 00:15:43.615\nYou saw in the video,\nI was doing a so-called exit protocol.\n\n00:15:43.639 --> 00:15:47.802\nOnce at the surface, I have 15 seconds\nto take off my nose clip,\n\n00:15:48.642 --> 00:15:51.523\ngive this signal and say\n(English) \"I am OK.\"\n\n00:15:51.947 --> 00:15:53.445\nPlus, you need to be bilingual.\n\n00:15:53.469 --> 00:15:54.911\n(Laughter)\n\n00:15:54.935 --> 00:15:56.101\nOn top of everything --\n\n00:15:56.125 --> 00:15:57.394\nthat's not very nice.\n\n00:15:58.855 --> 00:16:02.506\nOnce the protocol is completed,\nthe judges show me a white card,\n\n00:16:02.530 --> 00:16:04.127\nand that's when the joy starts.\n\n00:16:04.459 --> 00:16:07.159\nI can finally celebrate\nwhat has just happened.\n\n00:16:07.934 --> 00:16:10.212\nSo, the journey I've just described to you\n\n00:16:10.236 --> 00:16:13.409\nis a more extreme version of free diving.\n\n00:16:13.879 --> 00:16:16.070\nLuckily, it's far from just that.\n\n00:16:16.094 --> 00:16:17.301\nFor the past few years,\n\n00:16:17.325 --> 00:16:20.012\nI've been trying to show\nanother side of free diving,\n\n00:16:20.036 --> 00:16:23.143\nbecause the media mainly talks\nabout competitions and records.\n\n00:16:23.167 --> 00:16:25.048\nBut free diving is more than just that.\n\n00:16:25.072 --> 00:16:27.000\nIt's about being at ease in the water.\n\n00:16:27.024 --> 00:16:30.008\nIt's extremely beautiful,\nvery poetic and artistic.\n\n00:16:30.032 --> 00:16:32.096\nSo my wife and I decided to film it\n\n00:16:32.120 --> 00:16:34.646\nand try to show another side of it,\n\n00:16:35.242 --> 00:16:37.686\nmostly to make people want\nto go into the water.\n\n00:16:38.047 --> 00:16:42.542\nLet me show you some images\nto finish my story.\n\n00:16:43.812 --> 00:16:45.994\nIt's a mix of beautiful underwater photos.\n\n00:16:46.018 --> 00:16:47.170\n(Music)\n\n00:16:47.194 --> 00:16:52.253\nI'd like you to know that if one day\nyou try to stop breathing,\n\n00:16:52.277 --> 00:16:54.573\nyou'll realize that\nwhen you stop breathing,\n\n00:16:54.597 --> 00:16:56.684\nyou stop thinking, too.\n\n00:16:57.313 --> 00:16:59.105\nIt calms your mind.\n\n00:16:59.892 --> 00:17:03.178\nToday, in the 21st century,\nwe're under so much pressure.\n\n00:17:03.202 --> 00:17:06.229\nOur minds are overworked,\nwe think at a million miles an hour,\n\n00:17:06.253 --> 00:17:08.133\nwe're always stressed.\n\n00:17:08.157 --> 00:17:11.161\nBeing able to free dive\nlets you, just for a moment,\n\n00:17:11.185 --> 00:17:12.660\nrelax your mind.\n\n00:17:13.320 --> 00:17:15.312\nHolding your breath underwater\n\n00:17:15.336 --> 00:17:19.332\nmeans giving yourself the chance\nto experience weightlessness.\n\n00:17:19.356 --> 00:17:22.310\nIt means being underwater, floating,\n\n00:17:22.334 --> 00:17:26.157\nwith your body completely relaxed,\nletting go of all your tensions.\n\n00:17:26.181 --> 00:17:28.060\nThis is our plight in the 21st century:\n\n00:17:28.084 --> 00:17:30.401\nour backs hurt, our necks hurt,\neverything hurts,\n\n00:17:30.425 --> 00:17:32.634\nbecause we're stressed\nand tense all the time.\n\n00:17:32.658 --> 00:17:34.087\nBut when you're in the water,\n\n00:17:34.111 --> 00:17:36.701\nyou let yourself float,\nas if you were in space.\n\n00:17:37.109 --> 00:17:38.793\nYou let yourself go completely.\n\n00:17:38.817 --> 00:17:40.310\nIt's an extraordinary feeling.\n\n00:17:40.334 --> 00:17:45.991\nYou can finally get in touch\nwith your body, mind and spirit.\n\n00:17:46.434 --> 00:17:48.472\nEverything feels better, all at once.\n\n00:17:49.910 --> 00:17:54.105\nLearning how to free dive is also\nabout learning to breathe correctly.\n\n00:17:54.676 --> 00:17:59.134\nWe breathe with our first breath\nat birth, up until our last one.\n\n00:17:59.158 --> 00:18:02.712\nBreathing gives rhythm to our lives.\n\n00:18:02.736 --> 00:18:06.085\nLearning how to breathe better\nis learning how to live better.\n\n00:18:06.704 --> 00:18:09.839\nHolding your breath in the sea,\nnot necessarily at 100 meters,\n\n00:18:09.863 --> 00:18:11.138\nbut maybe at two or three,\n\n00:18:11.162 --> 00:18:13.228\nputting on your goggles,\na pair of flippers,\n\n00:18:13.252 --> 00:18:14.948\nmeans you can go see another world,\n\n00:18:14.972 --> 00:18:17.030\nanother universe, completely magical.\n\n00:18:17.054 --> 00:18:20.459\nYou can see little fish, seaweed,\nthe flora and fauna,\n\n00:18:20.483 --> 00:18:22.801\nyou can watch it all discreetly,\n\n00:18:22.825 --> 00:18:26.111\nsliding underwater, looking around,\nand coming back to the surface,\n\n00:18:26.135 --> 00:18:27.642\nleaving no trace.\n\n00:18:28.054 --> 00:18:32.110\nIt's an amazing feeling\nto become one with nature like that.\n\n00:18:33.177 --> 00:18:35.649\nAnd if I may say one more thing,\n\n00:18:36.467 --> 00:18:41.634\nholding your breath, being in the water,\nfinding this underwater world --\n\n00:18:41.658 --> 00:18:43.627\nit's all about connecting with yourself.\n\n00:18:43.651 --> 00:18:47.944\nYou heard me talk a lot\nabout the body's memory\n\n00:18:48.579 --> 00:18:51.480\nthat dates back millions of years,\nto our marine origins.\n\n00:18:51.504 --> 00:18:54.170\nThe day you get back into the water,\n\n00:18:54.194 --> 00:18:56.685\nwhen you hold your breath\nfor a few seconds,\n\n00:18:56.709 --> 00:18:59.629\nyou will reconnect with those origins.\n\n00:19:00.201 --> 00:19:01.720\nAnd I guarantee\n\n00:19:01.744 --> 00:19:03.085\nit's absolute magic.\n\n00:19:03.109 --> 00:19:04.562\nI encourage you to try it out.\n\n00:19:04.586 --> 00:19:05.752\nThank you.\n\n00:19:05.776 --> 00:19:09.497\n(Applause)"}, {"title": "The untapped genius that could change science for the better", "duration": "822", "url":

In fact, I would argue that some of the most interesting things of the human experience occur at the intersections, in the liminal space, where by liminal I mean the space in-between. There's freedom in that in-between, freedom to create from the indefiniteness of not-quite-here, not-quite-there, a new self-definition. Some of the great intersections of the world come to mind, like the Arc de Triomphe in Paris, or Times Square in New York City, both bustling with the excitement of a seemingly endless stream of people. Other intersections, like the Edmund Pettus Bridge in Selma, Alabama, or Canfield Drive and Copper Creek Court in Ferguson, Missouri, also come to mind because of the tremendous energy at the intersection of human beings, ideologies and the ongoing struggle for justice.Beyond the physical landscape of our planet, some of the most famous celestial images are of intersections. Stars are born at the messy intersection of gas and dust, instigated by gravity's irrevocable pull. Stars die by this same intersection, this time flung outward in a violent collision of smaller atoms, intersecting and efficiently fusing into altogether new and heavier things. We can all think of intersections that have special meaning to us. To be intersectional, then, is to occupy a position at an intersection.I've lived the entirety of my life in the in-between, in the liminal space between dreams and reality, race and gender, poverty and plenty, science and society. I am both black and a woman. Like the birth of stars in the heavenlies, this robust combination of knowing results in a shining example of the explosive fusion of identities.I am also an astrophysicist. I study blazars, supermassive, hyperactive black holes that sit at the centers of massive galaxies and shoot out jets nearby those black holes at speeds approaching the speed of light in a process we are still trying to completely understand.I have dreamed of becoming an astrophysicist since I was 12 years old. I had no idea that at that time, according to Dr. Jamie Alexander's archive of African-American women in physics, only 18 black women in the United States had ever earned a PhD in a physics-related discipline, and that the first black woman to graduate with a PhD in an astronomy-related field did so just one year before my birth.As I journeyed along my path, I encountered the best and worst of life at an intersection: the tremendous opportunity to self-define, the collision of expectation and experience, the exhilaration of victorious breakthroughs and, sometimes, the explosive pain of regeneration.I began my college experience just after my family had fallen apart. Our financial situation disintegrated just after my father's departure from our lives. This thrust my mother, my sister and I out of the relative comfort of middle-class life and into the almost constant struggle to make ends meet. Thus, I was one of roughly 60 percent of women of color who find finances to be a major barrier to their educational goals. Thankfully, Norfolk State University provided me with full funding, and I was able to achieve my bachelor's in physics.After graduation, and despite knowing that I wanted a PhD in astrophysics, I fell through the cracks. It was a poster that saved my dream, and some really incredible people and programs. The American Physical Society had this beautiful poster encouraging students of color to become physicists. It was striking to me because it featured a young black girl, probably around 12 years old, looking studiously at some physics equations. I remember thinking I was looking directly back at the little girl who first dared to dream this dream. I immediately wrote to the Society and requested my personal copy of the poster, which to this day still hangs in my office. I described to them in the email my educational path, and my desire to find myself again in pursuit of the PhD. They directed me to the Fisk-Vanderbilt University Bridge Program, itself an intersection of the master's and PhD degrees at two institutions. After two years out of school, they accepted me into the program, and I found myself again on the path to the PhD.After receiving my master's at Fisk, I went on to Yale to complete my PhD. Once I was physically occupying the space that would ultimately give way to my childhood aspirations, I anticipated a smooth glide to the PhD.(Laughter)It became immediately apparent that not everyone was thrilled to have that degree of liminality in their space. I was ostracized by many of my classmates, one of whom went so far as to invite me to \"do what I really came here to do\" as he pushed all the dirty dishes from our meal in front of me to clean up. I wish that were an isolated occurrence, but for many women of color in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics, or STEM, this is something they have long endured. One hundred percent of the 60 women of color interviewed in a recent study by Joan C. Williams at UC Hastings reported facing racialized gender bias, including being mistaken for the janitorial staff. This mistaken identity was not reported by any of the white women interviewed for this study, which comprised 557 women in total. While there is nothing inherently wrong with a janitorial position, and in fact my forefathers and foremothers were able to attend college because many of their parents worked these jobs, it was a clear attempt to put me in my place.While there was certainly the acute pain of the encounter, the real issue is that my appearance can tell anyone anything about my ability. Beyond that, though, it underscores that the women of color in STEM do not experience the same set of barriers that just women or just people of color face. That's why today I want to highlight women of color in STEM, who are inexorably, unapologetically living as the inseparable sum of identities.STEM itself is an intersectional term, such that its true richness cannot be appreciated without considering the liminal space between disciplines. Science, the pursuit of understanding the physical world by way of chemistry, physics, biology, cannot be accomplished in the absence of mathematics. Engineering requires the application of basic science and math to the lived experience. Technology sits firmly on the foundation of math, engineering and science. Math itself serves the critical role of Rosetta Stone, decoding and encoding the physical principles of the world. STEM is utterly incomplete without each individual piece. This is to say nothing of the enrichment that is realized when STEM is combined with other disciplines.The purpose for this talk is twofold: first, to say directly to every black, Latina, indigenous, First Nation or any other woman or girl who finds herself resting at the blessed intersection of race and gender, that you can be anything you want to be. My personal hope is that you'll become an astrophysicist, but beyond that, anything you want. Do not think for one minute that because you are who you are, you cannot be who you imagine yourself to be. Hold fast to those dreams and let them carry you into a world you can't even imagine.Secondly, among the most pressing issues of our time, most now find their intersection with STEM. We have as a global society solved most of the single-faceted issues of our time. Those that remain require a thorough investigation of the liminal space between disciplines to create the multifaceted solutions of tomorrow. Who better to solve these liminal problems than those who have faced their whole lives at the intersections. We as thought leaders and decision makers must push past the first steps of diversity and into the richer and more robust territory of full inclusion and equal opportunity.One of my favorite examples of liminal excellence comes from the late Dr. Claudia Alexander, a black woman plasma physicist, who passed away this past July after a 10-year bout with breast cancer. She was a NASA project scientist who spearheaded the NASA side of the Rosetta mission, which became famous this year for landing a rover on a comet, and the 1.5 billion dollar Galileo mission to Jupiter, two high-profile scientific victories for NASA, the United States and the world. Dr. Alexander said it this way: \"I'm used to walking between two cultures. For me, it's among the purposes of my life to take us from states of ignorance to states of understanding with bold exploration that you can't do every day.\"This shows exactly the power of a liminal person. She had the technical ability to spearhead some of the most ambitious space missions of our time, and she perfectly understood her place of being exactly who she was in any place she was.Jessica Matthews, inventor of the SOCCKET line of sports products, like soccer balls, that generate renewable energy as you play with them, said it this way: \"A major part of invention isn't just creating things, it's understanding people and understanding the systems that make this world.\" The reason I tell my story and the story of Dr. Alexander and Jessica Matthews is because they are fundamentally intersectional stories, the stories of lives lived at the nexus of race, gender and innovation.Despite implicit and explicit questions of my right to be in an elite space, I'm proud to report that when I graduated, I was the first black woman to earn a PhD in astrophysics in Yale's then 312-year history.(Applause)I am now part of a small but growing cadre of women of color in STEM who are poised to bring new perspectives and new ideas to life on the most pressing issues of our time: things like educational inequities, police brutality, HIV/AIDS, climate change, genetic editing, artificial intelligence and Mars exploration. This is to say nothing of the things we haven't even thought of yet.Women of color in STEM occupy some of the toughest and most exciting sociotechnological issues of our time. Thus, we are uniquely positioned to contribute to and drive these conversations in ways that are more inclusive of a wider variety of lived experience. This outlook can be expanded to the many intersectional people whose experiences, positive and negative, enrich the conversations in ways that outmatch even the best-resourced homogenous groups.This is not a request born out of a desire to fit in. It's a reminder that we cannot get to the best possible outcomes for the totality of humanity without precisely this collaboration, this bringing together of the liminal, the differently lived, distinctly experienced and disparately impacted. Simply put, we cannot be the most excellent expression of our collective genius without the full measure of humanity brought to bear.Thank you.(Applause)", "id": 2387, "subtitle":

resting\nat the blessed intersection\n\n00:08:44.078 --> 00:08:46.093\nof race and gender,\n\n00:08:46.117 --> 00:08:49.078\nthat you can be anything you want to be.\n\n00:08:50.117 --> 00:08:53.613\nMy personal hope is\nthat you'll become an astrophysicist,\n\n00:08:53.637 --> 00:08:56.694\nbut beyond that, anything you want.\n\n00:08:56.718 --> 00:08:59.774\nDo not think for one minute\n\n00:08:59.798 --> 00:09:02.054\nthat because you are who you are,\n\n00:09:02.078 --> 00:09:05.614\nyou cannot be\nwho you imagine yourself to be.\n\n00:09:05.638 --> 00:09:08.094\nHold fast to those dreams\n\n00:09:08.118 --> 00:09:11.798\nand let them carry you\ninto a world you can't even imagine.\n\n00:09:12.598 --> 00:09:16.334\nSecondly, among the most\npressing issues of our

single-faceted\nissues of our time.\n\n00:09:25.758 --> 00:09:29.214\nThose that remain\nrequire a thorough investigation\n\n00:09:29.238 --> 00:09:32.014\nof the liminal space between

00:09:43.934\nthan those who have faced\ntheir whole lives at the intersections.\n\n00:09:43.958 --> 00:09:46.894\nWe as thought leaders and decision makers\n\n00:09:46.918 --> 00:09:50.334\nmust push

opportunity.\n\n00:09:57.718 --> 00:10:00.774\nOne of my favorite examples\nof liminal excellence\n\n00:10:00.798 --> 00:10:03.654\ncomes from the late Dr. Claudia Alexander,\n\n00:10:03.678 --> 00:10:05.414\na black woman plasma physicist,\n\n00:10:05.438 --> 00:10:10.494\nwho passed away this past July\nafter a 10-year bout with breast cancer.\n\n00:10:10.518 --> 00:10:14.614\nShe was a NASA project scientist\nwho spearheaded the NASA side\n\n00:10:14.638 --> 00:10:16.094\nof the Rosetta mission,\n\n00:10:16.118 --> 00:10:20.574\nwhich became famous this year\nfor landing a rover on a comet,\n\n00:10:20.598 --> 00:10:25.094\nand the 1.5 billion dollar\nGalileo mission to Jupiter,\n\n00:10:25.118 --> 00:10:28.094\ntwo high-profile scientific victories\n\n00:10:28.118 --> 00:10:32.214\nfor NASA, the United States\nand the world.\n\n00:10:32.238 --> 00:10:34.934\nDr. Alexander said it this way:\n\n00:10:34.958 --> 00:10:37.654\n\"I'm used to walking between two cultures.\n\n00:10:37.678 --> 00:10:40.814\nFor me, it's among the purposes of my life\n\n00:10:40.838 --> 00:10:44.454\nto take us from states of ignorance\nto states of understanding\n\n00:10:44.478 --> 00:10:48.854\nwith bold exploration\nthat you can't do every day.\"\n\n00:10:48.878 --> 00:10:52.654\nThis shows exactly\nthe power of a liminal person.\n\n00:10:52.678 --> 00:10:55.054\nShe had the technical ability to spearhead\n\n00:10:55.078 --> 00:10:58.174\nsome of the most ambitious\nspace missions of our time,\n\n00:10:58.198 --> 00:11:01.534\nand she perfectly understood her

00:11:19.174\n\"A major part of invention\nisn't just creating things,\n\n00:11:19.198 --> 00:11:21.014\nit's understanding people\n\n00:11:21.038 --> 00:11:24.278\nand understanding the systems\nthat make this world.\"\n\n00:11:25.278 --> 00:11:27.094\nThe reason I tell my story\n\n00:11:27.118 --> 00:11:30.174\nand the story of Dr. Alexander\nand Jessica Matthews\n\n00:11:30.198 -->

00:11:52.414\nI was the first black woman\nto earn a PhD in astrophysics\n\n00:11:52.438 --> 00:11:55.534\nin Yale's then 312-year history.\n\n00:11:55.558 --> 00:12:01.454\n(Applause)\n\n00:12:01.478

Soon you'll download your new clothes", "duration": "380", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/danit_peleg_forget_shopping_soon_you_ll_download_your_new_clothes", "transcript": "In the past few months, I've been traveling for weeks at a time with only one suitcase of clothes. One day, I was invited to an important event, and I wanted to wear something special and new for it. So I looked through my suitcase and I couldn't find anything to wear. I was lucky to be at the technology conference on that day, and I had access to 3D printers. So I quickly designed a skirt on my computer, and I loaded the file on the printer. It just printed the pieces overnight. The next morning, I just took all the pieces, assembled them together in my hotel room, and this is actually the skirt that I'm wearing right now.(Applause)So it wasn't the first time that I printed clothes. For my senior collection at fashion design school, I decided to try and 3D print an entire fashion collection from my home. The problem was that I barely knew anything about 3D printing, and I had only nine months to figure out how to print five fashionable looks.I always felt most creative when I worked from home. I loved experimenting with new materials, and I always tried to develop new techniques to make the most unique textiles for my fashion projects. I loved going to old factories and weird stores in search of leftovers of strange powders and weird materials, and then bring them home to experiment on. As you can probably imagine, my roommates didn't like that at all.(Laughter)So I decided to move on to working with big machines, ones that didn't fit in my living room. I love the exact and the custom work I can do with all kinds of fashion technologies, like knitting machines and laser cutting and silk printing.One summer break, I came here to New York for an internship at a fashion house in Chinatown. We worked on two incredible dresses that were 3D printed. They were amazing \u2014 like you can see here. But I had a few issues with them. They were made from hard plastics and that's why they were very breakable. The models couldn't sit in them, and they even got scratched from the plastics under their arms.With 3D printing, the designers had so much freedom to make the dresses look exactly like they wanted, but still, they were very dependent on big and expensive industrial printers that were located in a lab far from their studio.Later that year, a friend gave me a 3D printed necklace, printed using a home printer. I knew that these printers were much cheaper and much more accessible than the ones we used at my internship. So I looked at the necklace, and then I thought, \"If I can print a necklace from home, why not print my clothes from home, too?\" I really liked the idea that I wouldn't have to go to the market and pick fabrics that someone else chose to sell \u2014 I could just design them and print them directly from home.I found a small makerspace, where I learned everything I know about 3D printing. Right away, they literally gave me the key to the lab, so I could experiment into the night, every night.The main challenge was to find the right filament for printing clothes with. So what is a filament? Filament is the material you feed the printer with. And I spent a month or so experimenting with PLA, which is a hard and scratchy, breakable material.The breakthrough came when I was introduced to Filaflex, which is a new kind of filament. It's strong, yet very flexible. And with it, I was able to print the first garment, the red jacket that had the word \"Libert\u00e9\" \u2014 \"freedom\" in French \u2014 embedded into it. I chose this word because I felt so empowered and free when I could just design a garment from my home and then print it by myself. And actually, you can easily download this jacket, and easily change the word to something else. For example, your name or your sweetheart's name.(Laughter)So the printer plates are small, so I had to piece the garment together, just like a puzzle.And I wanted to solve another challenge. I wanted to print textiles that I would use just like regular fabrics. That's when I found an open-source file from an architect who designed a pattern that I love. And with it, I was able to print a beautiful textile that I would use just like a regular fabric. And it actually even looks a little bit like lace.So I took his file and I modified it, and changed it, played with it \u2014 many kinds of versions out of it. And I needed to print another 1,500 more hours to complete printing my collection. So I brought six printers to my home and just printed 24-7. And this is actually a really slow process, but let's remember the Internet was significantly slower 20 years ago, so 3D printing will also accelerate and in no time you'll be able to print a T-Shirt in your home in just a couple of hours, or even minutes.So you guys, you want to see what it looks like?Audience: Yeah!(Applause)Danit Peleg: Rebecca is wearing one of my five outfits. Almost everything here she's wearing, I printed from my home. Even her shoes are printed.Audience: Wow!Audience: Cool!(Applause)Danit Peleg: Thank you, Rebecca. (To audience) Thank you, guys.So I think in the future, materials will evolve, and they will look and feel like fabrics we know today, like cotton or silk. Imagine personalized clothes that fit exactly to your measurements.Music was once a very physical thing. You would have to go to the record shop and buy CDs, but now you can just download the music \u2014 digital music \u2014 directly to your phone. Fashion is also a very physical thing. And I wonder what our world will look like when our clothes will be digital, just like this skirt is.Thank you so much.(Applause)[Thank You](Applause)", "id": 2388, "subtitle":

filament.\n\n00:03:33.863 --> 00:03:36.203\nIt's strong, yet very flexible.\n\n00:03:36.227 --> 00:03:40.061\nAnd with it, I was able to print\nthe first garment,\n\n00:03:40.085 --> 00:03:43.533\nthe red jacket that had\nthe word \"Libert\u00e9\" --\n\n00:03:43.557 --> 00:03:44.752\n\"freedom\" in French --\n\n00:03:44.776 --> 00:03:46.289\nembedded into it.\n\n00:03:46.313 --> 00:03:49.106\nI chose this word because I felt\nso empowered and free\n\n00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:51.433\nwhen I could just design\na garment from my home\n\n00:03:51.457 --> 00:03:53.566\nand then print it by myself.\n\n00:03:54.286 --> 00:03:57.700\nAnd actually, you can easily\ndownload this jacket,\n\n00:03:57.724 --> 00:04:00.352\nand easily change the word\nto something else.\n\n00:04:00.376 --> 00:04:03.024\nFor example, your name\nor your sweetheart's name.\n\n00:04:03.465 --> 00:04:04.615\n(Laughter)\n\n00:04:04.998 --> 00:04:06.724\nSo the printer plates are small,\n\n00:04:06.748 --> 00:04:10.826\nso I had to piece the garment\ntogether, just like a puzzle.\n\n00:04:12.196 --> 00:04:14.447\nAnd I wanted to solve another challenge.\n\n00:04:14.471 --> 00:04:16.016\nI wanted to print textiles\n\n00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:18.545\nthat I would use\njust like regular fabrics.\n\n00:04:18.569 --> 00:04:20.503\nThat's when I found an open-source file\n\n00:04:20.527 --> 00:04:23.116\nfrom an architect who designed\na pattern that I love.\n\n00:04:23.140 --> 00:04:25.859\nAnd with it, I was able to print\na beautiful textile\n\n00:04:25.883 --> 00:04:28.507\nthat I would use\njust like a regular fabric.\n\n00:04:29.125 --> 00:04:31.856\nAnd it actually even looks\na little bit like lace.\n\n00:04:33.205 --> 00:04:36.595\nSo I took his file and I modified it,\nand changed it, played with it --\n\n00:04:36.619 --> 00:04:39.213\nmany kinds of versions out of it.\n\n00:04:39.612 --> 00:04:43.796\nAnd I needed to print\nanother 1,500 more hours\n\n00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:46.747\nto complete printing my collection.\n\n00:04:46.771 --> 00:04:50.579\nSo I brought six printers to my home\nand just printed 24-7.\n\n00:04:51.134 --> 00:04:53.654\nAnd this is actually\na really slow process,\n\n00:04:53.678 --> 00:04:58.021\nbut let's remember the Internet\nwas significantly slower 20 years ago,\n\n00:04:58.045 --> 00:05:00.370\nso 3D printing will also accelerate\n\n00:05:00.394 --> 00:05:03.377\nand in no time you'll be able to print\na T-Shirt in your home\n\n00:05:03.401 --> 00:05:06.366\nin just a couple of hours,\nor even minutes.\n\n00:05:06.784 --> 00:05:09.104\nSo you guys, you want to see\nwhat it looks like?\n\n00:05:09.128 --> 00:05:10.429\nAudience: Yeah!\n\n00:05:10.453 --> 00:05:12.304\n(Applause)\n\n00:05:14.251 --> 00:05:17.767\nDanit Peleg: Rebecca is wearing\none of my five outfits.\n\n00:05:17.791 --> 00:05:22.608\nAlmost everything here she's wearing,\nI printed from my home.\n\n00:05:23.037 --> 00:05:25.288\nEven her shoes are printed.\n\n00:05:25.312 --> 00:05:26.464\nAudience: Wow!\n\n00:05:26.488 --> 00:05:27.653\nAudience: Cool!\n\n00:05:29.724 --> 00:05:31.479\n(Applause)\n\n00:05:31.503 --> 00:05:33.046\nDanit Peleg: Thank you, Rebecca.\n\n00:05:33.664 --> 00:05:35.784\n(To audience) Thank you, guys.\n\n00:05:36.806 --> 00:05:39.323\nSo I think in the future,\nmaterials will evolve,\n\n00:05:39.347 --> 00:05:42.528\nand they will look and feel\nlike fabrics we know today,\n\n00:05:42.552 --> 00:05:44.488\nlike cotton or silk.\n\n00:05:45.307 --> 00:05:49.274\nImagine personalized clothes\nthat fit exactly to your measurements.\n\n00:05:51.495 --> 00:05:53.472\nMusic was once a very physical thing.\n\n00:05:53.496 --> 00:05:56.520\nYou would have to go\nto the record shop and buy CDs,\n\n00:05:56.544 --> 00:05:59.194\nbut now you can just download the music --\n\n00:05:59.218 --> 00:06:00.377\ndigital music --\n\n00:06:00.401 --> 00:06:01.734\ndirectly to your phone.\n\n00:06:02.463 --> 00:06:04.924\nFashion is also a very physical thing.\n\n00:06:05.258 --> 00:06:08.140\nAnd I wonder what our world will look like\n\n00:06:08.164 --> 00:06:11.508\nwhen our clothes will be digital,\njust like this skirt is.\n\n00:06:12.014 --> 00:06:13.387\nThank you so much.\n\n00:06:13.411 --> 00:06:14.611\n(Applause)\n\n00:06:14.635 --> 00:06:15.785\n[Thank You]\n\n00:06:15.809 --> 00:06:18.608\n(Applause)"}]

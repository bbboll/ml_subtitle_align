"transcript": "Sergey Brin: I want to discuss a question I know that's been pressing on many of your minds. We spoke to you last several years ago. And before I get started today, since many of you are wondering, I just wanted to get it out of the way. The answer is boxers. Now I hope all of you feel better.Do you know what this might be? Does anyone know what that is?Audience: Yes.SB: What is it?Audience: It's people logging on to Google around the world.SB: Wow, OK. I didn't really realize what it was when I first saw it. But this is what helped me see it. This is what we run at the office, that actually runs real time. Here it's slightly logged. But here you can see around the world how people are using Google. And every one of those rising dots represents probably about 20, 30 searches, or something like that. And they're labeled by color right now, by language.So you can see: here we are in the U.S., and they're all coming up red. There we are in Monterey \u2014 hopefully I can get it right. You can see that Japan is busy at night, right there. We have Tokyo coming in in Japanese. There's a lot of activity in China. There's a lot of activity in India. There's some in the Middle East, the little pockets. And Europe, which is right now in the middle of the day, is going really strong with a whole wide variety of languages.Now you can also see, if I turn this around here \u2014 hopefully I won't shake the world too much. But you can also see, there are places where there's not so much. Australia, because there just aren't very many people there. And this is something that we should really work on, which is Africa, which is just a few trickles, basically in South Africa and a few other urban cities. But basically, what we've noticed is these queries, which come in at thousands per second, are available everywhere there is power. And pretty much everywhere there is power, there is the Internet. And even in Antarctica \u2014 well, at least this time of year \u2014 we from time to time will see a query rising up. And if we had it plotted correctly, I think the International Space Station would have it, too.So this is some of the challenge that we have here, is you can see that it's actually kind of hard to get the \u2014 there we go. This is how we have to move the bits around to actually get the people the answers to their questions. You can see that there's a lot of data running around. It has to go all over the world: through fibers, through satellites, through all kinds of connections. And it's pretty tricky for us to maintain the latencies as low as we try to. Hopefully your experience is good. But you can see also, once again \u2014 so some places are much more wired than others, and you can see all the bandwidth across the U.S., going up over to Asia, Europe in the other direction, and so forth.Now what I would like to do is just to show you what one second of this activity would look like. And if we can switch to slides \u2014 all right, here we go. So this is slowed down. This is what one second looks like. And this is what we spend a lot of our time doing, is just making sure that we can keep up with this kind of traffic load. Now, each one of those queries has an interesting life and tale of its own. I mean, it could be somebody's health, it could be somebody's career, something important to them. And it could potentially be something as important as tomato sauce, or in this case, ketchup.So this is a query that we had \u2014 I guess it's a popular band that was more popular in some parts of the world than others. You can see that it got started right here. In the U.S. and Spain, it was popular at the same time. But it didn't have quite the same pickup in the U.S. as it did in Spain. And then from Spain, it went to Italy, and then Germany got excited, and maybe right now the U.K. is enjoying it. And so I guess the U.S. finally, finally started to like it, too. And I just wanted to play it for you.Anyway, you can all enjoy it for yourselves \u2014 hopefully that search will work. As a part of \u2014 you know, part of what we want to do to grow our company is to have more searches. And what that means is we want to have more people who are healthy and educated. More animals, if they start doing searches as well. But partly, we want to make the world a better place, and so one thing that we're embarking upon is the Google Foundation, and we're in the process of setting that up.We also have a program already called Google Grants that now serves over 150 different charities around the world, and these are some of the charities that are on there. And it's something I'm very excited to be a part of. In fact, many of the organizations that are here \u2014 the Acumen Fund, I think ApproTEC we have running, I'm not sure if that one's up yet \u2014 and many of the people who have presented here are running through Google Grants. They run Google ads, and we just give them the ad credit so they can let organizations know.One of the earlier results that we got \u2014 we have a Singaporean businessman who is now sponsoring a village of 25 Vietnamese girls for their education, and that was one of the earliest results. And as I said, now there have been many, many stories that have come in, because we do have hundreds of charities in there, and the Google Foundation will be an even broader endeavor. Now does anybody know who this is? A-ha!Audience: Orkut.SB: Yes! Somebody got it. This is Orkut. Is anybody here on Orkut? Do we have any? Okay, not very many people know about it. I'll explain it in a second. This is one of our engineers. We find that they work better when they're submerged and covered with leaves. That's how we churn those products out. Orkut had a vision to create a social network. I know all of you are thinking, \"Yet another social network.\" But it was a dream of his, and we, basically, when people really want to do something, well, we generally let them. So this is what he built. We just released it in a test phase last month, and it's been taking off.This is our VP of Engineering. You can see the red hair, and I don't know if you can see the nose ring there. And these are all of his friends. So this is how \u2014 we just deployed it \u2014 we just decided that people would send each other invitations to get into the service, and so we just had the people in our company initially send them out. And now we've grown to over 100,000 members. And they spread, actually, very quickly, even outside the U.S.You can see, even though the U.S. is still the majority here \u2014 though, by the way, search-wise, it's only about 30 percent of our traffic \u2014 but it's already going to Japan, and the U.K., and Europe, and all the rest of the countries. So it's a fun little project. There are a variety of demographics. I won't bore you with these. But it's just the kind of thing that we just try out for fun and see where it goes. And \u2014 well, I'll leave you in suspense. Larry, you can explain this one.Larry Page: Thank you, Sergey. So one of the things \u2014 both Sergey and I went to a Montessori school, and I think, for some reason, this has been incorporated in Google. And Sergey mentioned Orkut, which is something that, you know, Orkut wanted to do in his time, and we call this \u2014 at Google, we've embodied this as \"the 20 percent time,\" and the idea is, for 20 percent of your time, if you're working at Google, you can do what you think is the best thing to do. And many, many things at Google have come out of that, such as Orkut and also Google News. And I think many other things in the world also have come out of this. Mendel, who was supposed to be teaching high-school students, actually, you know, discovered the laws of genetics \u2014 as a hobby, basically. So many, many useful things come out of this.And News, which I just mentioned, was started by a researcher. And he just \u2014 he \u2014 after 9/11, he got really interested in the news. And he said, \"Why don't I look at the news better?\" And so he started clustering it by category, and then he started using it, and then his friends started using it. And then, besides just looking cute on a baby's bottom, we made it a Googlette, which is basically a small project at Google.So it'd be like three people, or something like that, and they would try to make a product. And we wouldn't really be sure if it's going to work or not. And in News' case, you know, they had a couple of people working on it for a while, and then more and more people started using it, and then we put it out on the Internet, and more and more people started using it. And now it's a real, full-blown project with more people on it. And this is how we keep our innovation running.I think usually, as companies get bigger, they find it really hard to have small, innovative projects. And we had this problem, too, for a while, and we said, \"Oh, we really need a new concept.\" You know, the Googlettes \u2014 that's a small project that we're not quite sure if it's going to work or not, but we hope it will, and if we do enough of them, some of them will really work and turn out, such as News.But then we had a problem because then we had over 100 projects. And I don't know about all of you, but I have trouble keeping 100 things in my head at once. And we found that if we just wrote all of them down and ordered them \u2014 and these are kind of made up. Don't really pay attention to them. For example, the \"Buy Iceland\" was from a media article. We would never do such a crazy thing, but \u2014 in any case, we found if we just basically wrote them all down and ordered them, that most people would actually agree what the ordering should be. And this was kind of a surprise to me, but we found that as long as you keep the 100 things in your head, which you did by writing them down, that you could do a pretty good job deciding what to do and where to put your resources. And so that's basically what we've done since we instituted that a few years ago, and I think it has really allowed us to be innovative and still stay reasonably well-organized.The other thing we discovered is that people like to work on things that are important, and so naturally, people sort of migrate to the things that are high priorities. I just wanted to highlight a couple of things that are new, or you might not know about. And the top thing, actually, is the Deskbar. So this is a new \u2014 how many of you use the Google Toolbar? Raise your hands.How many of you use the Deskbar? All right, see? You guys should try it out. But if you go to our site and search for \"Deskbar,\" you'll get this. And the idea is, instead of a toolbar, it's just present all the time on your screen on the bottom, and you can do searches really easily. And it's sort of like a better version of the toolbar. Thank you, Sergey.This is another example of a project that somebody at Google was really passionate about, and they just, they got going, and it's really, really a great product, and really taking off. Google Answers is something we started, which is really cool, which lets you \u2014 for five to 100 dollars, you can type a question in, and then there's a pool of researchers that go out and research it for you, and it's guaranteed and all that, and you can get actually very good answers to things without spending all that time yourself.Froogle lets you search shopping information, and Blogger lets you publish things. But all of these \u2014 well, these were all sort of innovative things that we did that \u2014 you know, we try many, many different things in our company. We also like to innovate in our physical space, and we noticed in meetings, you know, you have to wait a long time for projectors to turn on and off, and they're noisy, so people shut them off. And we didn't like that, so we actually, in maybe a couple of weeks, we built these little enclosures that enclosed the projectors, and so we can leave them on all the time and they're completely silent. And as a result, we were able to build some software that also lets us manage a meeting, so when you walk into a meeting room now, it lists all the meetings that are happening, you can very easily take notes, and they just get emailed automatically to all the people that were present in the meeting.And as we become more of a global company, we find these things really affect us \u2014 you know, can we work effectively with people who aren't in the room? And things like that. And simple things like this can really make a big difference. We also have a lot of engineers in those meetings, and they don't always do their laundry as much as they should. And so we found it was pretty helpful to have laundry machines, for our younger employees especially, and ... we also allow dogs and things like that, and we've had, I think, a really fun culture at our company, which helps people work and enjoy what they're doing.This is actually our \"cult picture.\" I just wanted to show quickly. We had this on our website for a while, but we found that after we put it on our website, we didn't get any job applications anymore. But anyway, every year we've taken the whole company on a ski trip. A lot of work happens in companies from people knowing each other, and informally. And I think we've done a good job encouraging that. It makes it a really fun place to work.Along with our logos, too, which I think really embody our culture when we change things. In the early days, we were actually advised we should never change our logo because we should establish our brand, you know, because, you know, you'd never want to change your logo. You want it to be consistent. And we said, \"Well, that doesn't sound so much fun. Why don't we try changing it every day?\"One of the things that really excites me about what we're doing now is we have this thing called AdSense, and this is a little bit foreshadowing \u2014 this is from before Dean dropped out. But the idea is, like, on a newspaper, for example, we show you relevant ads. And this is hard to read, but this says \"Battle for New Hampshire: Howard Dean for President\" \u2014 articles on Howard Dean. And these ads are generated automatically \u2014 like in this case, on the Washington Post \u2014 from the content on the site. And so we use our over 150,000 advertisers and millions of advertisements, so we pick the one that's most relevant to what you're actually looking at, much as we do on search. So the idea is we can make advertising useful, not just annoying, right?And the nice thing about this, we have a self-serve program, and many thousands of websites have signed up, and this let's them really make money. And I \u2014 you know, there's a number of people I met \u2014 I met this guy who runs a conservation site at a party, and he said, \"You know, I wasn't making any money. I just put this thing on my site and I'm making 10,000 dollars a month. And, you know, thank you. I don't have to do my other job now.\" And I think this is really important for us, because it makes the Internet work better. It makes content get better, it makes searching work better, when people can really make their livelihood from producing great content.So this session is supposed to be about the future, so I'd thought I'd talk at least briefly about it. And the idea behind this is to do the perfect job doing search, you really have to be smart. Because you can type, you know, any kind of thing into Google, and you expect an answer back, right? But finding things is tricky, and so you really want intelligence. And in fact, the ultimate search engine would be smart. It would be artificial intelligence. And so that's something we work on, and we even have some people who are excited enough and crazy enough to work on it now, and that's really their goal. So we always hope that Google will be smart, but we're always surprised when other people think that it is.And so I just wanted to give a funny example of this. This is a blog from Iraq, and it's not really what I'm going to talk about, but I just wanted to show you an example. Maybe, Sergey, you can highlight this. So we decided \u2014 actually, the highlight's right there. Oh, thank you.So, \"related searches,\" right there. You can't see it that well, but we decided we should put in this feature into our AdSense ads, called \"related searches.\" And so we'd say, you know, \"Did you mean 'search for'\" \u2014 what is this, in this case, \"Saddam Hussein,\" because this blog is about Iraq \u2014 and you know, in addition to the ads, and we thought this would be a great idea.And so there is this blog of a young person who was kind of depressed, and he said, \"You know, I'm sleeping a lot.\" He was just kind of writing about his life. And our algorithms \u2014 not a person, of course, but our algorithms, our computers \u2014 read his blog and decided that the related search was, \"I am bored.\" And he read this, and he thought a person had decided that he was boring, and it was very unfortunate, and he said, \"You know, what are these, you know, bastards at Google doing? Why don't they like my blog?\" And so then we read his blog, which was getting \u2014 you know, sort of going from bad to worse, and we said the related search was, \"Retards.\" And then, you know, he got even more mad, and he wrote \u2014 like, started swearing and so on. And then we produced \"You suck.\" And finally, it ended with \"Kiss my ass.\" And so basically, he thought he was dealing with something smart, and of course, you know, we just sort of wrote this program and we tried it out, and it didn't quite work, and we don't have this feature anymore.So with that, maybe I can switch back to the world. I wanted to end just by saying that there's a couple things that really make me excited to be involved with Google, and one of those is that we're able to make money largely through advertising, and one of the benefits that I didn't expect from that was that we're able to serve everyone in the world without worrying about, you know, places that don't have as much money. So we don't have to worry about our products being sold, for example, for less money in places that are poor, and then they get re-imported into the U.S. \u2014 for example, with the drug industry.And I think we're really lucky to have that kind of business model because everyone in the world has access to our search, and I think that's a tremendous, tremendous benefit. The other thing I wanted to mention just briefly is that we have a tremendous ability and responsibility to provide people the right information, and we view ourselves like a newspaper or a magazine \u2014 that we should provide very objective information.And so in our search results, we never accept payment for our search results. We accept payment for advertising, and we mark it as such. And that's unlike many of our competitors. And I think decisions we're able to make like that have a tremendous impact on the world, and it makes me really proud to be involved with Google.

Does anyone know what that is?\n\n00:00:43.958 --> 00:00:44.958\nAudience: Yes.\n\n00:00:44.958 --> 00:00:46.958\nSB: What is it?\n\n00:00:46.958 --> 00:00:48.958\nAudience: It's people logging on to Google around the world.\n\n00:00:48.958 --> 00:00:51.958\nSB: Wow, OK. I didn't really realize what it was when I first saw it.\n\n00:00:51.958 --> 00:00:54.958\nBut this is what helped me see it.\n\n00:00:54.958 --> 00:00:57.958\nThis is what we run at the office, that actually runs real time.\n\n00:00:57.958 --> 00:00:59.958\nHere it's slightly logged.\n\n00:00:59.958 --> 00:01:01.958\nBut here you can see around the world\n\n00:01:01.958 --> 00:01:04.958\nhow people are using Google.\n\n00:01:04.958 --> 00:01:06.958\nAnd every one of those rising dots\n\n00:01:06.958 --> 00:01:09.958\nrepresents probably about 20, 30 searches,\n\n00:01:09.958 --> 00:01:11.958\nor something like that.\n\n00:01:11.958 --> 00:01:15.958\nAnd they're labeled by color right now, by language.\n\n00:01:15.958 --> 00:01:17.958\nSo you can see: here we are in the U.S.,\n\n00:01:17.958 --> 00:01:19.958\nand they're all coming up red.\n\n00:01:19.958 --> 00:01:21.958\nThere we are in Monterey -- hopefully I can get it right.\n\n00:01:21.958 --> 00:01:24.958\nYou can see that Japan is busy at night,\n\n00:01:24.958 --> 00:01:26.958\nright there.\n\n00:01:26.958 --> 00:01:29.958\nWe have Tokyo coming in in Japanese.\n\n00:01:29.958 --> 00:01:31.958\nThere's a lot of activity in China.\n\n00:01:31.958 --> 00:01:34.958\nThere's a lot of activity in India.\n\n00:01:34.958 --> 00:01:38.958\nThere's some in the Middle East, the little pockets.\n\n00:01:38.958 --> 00:01:41.958\nAnd Europe, which is right now in the middle of the day,\n\n00:01:41.958 --> 00:01:45.958\nis going really strong with a whole wide variety of languages.\n\n00:01:52.958 --> 00:01:58.958\nNow you can also see, if I turn this around here --\n\n00:02:00.958 --> 00:02:03.958\nhopefully I won't shake the world too much.\n\n00:02:03.958 --> 00:02:06.958\nBut you can also see, there are places where there's not so much.\n\n00:02:06.958 --> 00:02:09.958\nAustralia, because there just aren't very many people there.\n\n00:02:09.958 --> 00:02:12.958\nAnd this is something that we should really work on,\n\n00:02:12.958 --> 00:02:16.958\nwhich is Africa, which is just a few trickles,\n\n00:02:16.958 --> 00:02:19.958\nbasically in South Africa and a few other urban cities.\n\n00:02:19.958 --> 00:02:23.958\nBut basically, what we've noticed is these queries,\n\n00:02:23.958 --> 00:02:25.958\nwhich come in at thousands per second,\n\n00:02:25.958 --> 00:02:28.958\nare available everywhere there is power.\n\n00:02:28.958 --> 00:02:31.958\nAnd pretty much everywhere there is power, there is the Internet.\n\n00:02:32.958 --> 00:02:37.958\nAnd even in Antarctica -- well, at least this time of year --\n\n00:02:37.958 --> 00:02:39.958\nwe from time to time will see a query rising up.\n\n00:02:39.958 --> 00:02:41.958\nAnd if we had it plotted correctly,\n\n00:02:41.958 --> 00:02:44.958\nI think the International Space Station would have it, too.\n\n00:02:52.958 --> 00:02:54.958\nSo this is\n\n00:02:55.958 --> 00:02:59.958\nsome of the challenge that we have here,\n\n00:02:59.958 --> 00:03:03.958\nis you can see that it's actually kind of hard to get the --\n\n00:03:08.958 --> 00:03:10.958\nthere we go.\n\n00:03:10.958 --> 00:03:11.958\nThis is how we have to move the bits around\n\n00:03:11.958 --> 00:03:13.958\nto actually get the people the answers to their questions.\n\n00:03:13.958 --> 00:03:17.958\nYou can see that there's a lot of data running around.\n\n00:03:17.958 --> 00:03:20.958\nIt has to go all over the world: through fibers,\n\n00:03:20.958 --> 00:03:22.958\nthrough satellites, through all kinds of connections.\n\n00:03:22.958 --> 00:03:27.958\nAnd it's pretty tricky for us to maintain the latencies\n\n00:03:27.958 --> 00:03:31.958\nas low as we try to. Hopefully your experience is good.\n\n00:03:31.958 --> 00:03:33.958\nBut you can see also, once again -- so some places are much more wired\n\n00:03:33.958 --> 00:03:37.958\nthan others, and you can see all the bandwidth across the U.S.,\n\n00:03:37.958 --> 00:03:42.958\ngoing up over to Asia, Europe in the other direction, and so forth.\n\n00:03:42.958 --> 00:03:45.958\nNow what I would like to do is just to show you\n\n00:03:45.958 --> 00:03:49.958\nwhat one second of this activity would look like.\n\n00:03:49.958 --> 00:03:52.958\nAnd if we can switch to slides --\n\n00:03:55.958 --> 00:03:57.958\nall right, here we go.\n\n00:03:57.958 --> 00:04:00.958\nSo this is slowed down.\n\n00:04:03.958 --> 00:04:06.958\nThis is what one second looks like.\n\n00:04:06.958 --> 00:04:08.958\nAnd this is what we spend a lot of our time doing,\n\n00:04:08.958 --> 00:04:10.958\nis just making sure that we can keep up\n\n00:04:10.958 --> 00:04:12.958\nwith this kind of traffic load.\n\n00:04:16.958 --> 00:04:18.958\nNow, each one of those queries\n\n00:04:18.958 --> 00:04:20.958\nhas an interesting life and tale of its own.\n\n00:04:20.958 --> 00:04:22.958\nI mean, it could be somebody's health,\n\n00:04:22.958 --> 00:04:25.958\nit could be somebody's career, something important to them.\n\n00:04:25.958 --> 00:04:29.958\nAnd it could potentially be something\n\n00:04:29.958 --> 00:04:34.958\nas important as tomato sauce,\n\n00:04:34.958 --> 00:04:37.958\nor in this case, ketchup.\n\n00:04:37.958 --> 00:04:39.958\nSo this is a query that we had --\n\n00:04:40.958 --> 00:04:43.958\nI guess it's a popular band that was more popular in some parts of the world than others.\n\n00:04:43.958 --> 00:04:46.958\nYou can see that it got started right here.\n\n00:04:46.958 --> 00:04:49.958\nIn the U.S. and Spain, it was popular at the same time.\n\n00:04:49.958 --> 00:04:51.958\nBut it didn't have quite the same pickup in the U.S.\n\n00:04:51.958 --> 00:04:53.958\nas it did in Spain.\n\n00:04:53.958 --> 00:04:55.958\nAnd then from Spain, it went to Italy,\n\n00:04:55.958 --> 00:04:59.958\nand then Germany got excited, and maybe right now the U.K. is enjoying it.\n\n00:04:59.958 --> 00:05:01.958\nAnd so I guess the U.S. finally,\n\n00:05:01.958 --> 00:05:04.958\nfinally started to like it, too.\n\n00:05:04.958 --> 00:05:07.958\nAnd I just wanted to play it for you.\n\n00:05:12.958 --> 00:05:14.958\nAnyway, you can all enjoy it for yourselves --\n\n00:05:14.958 --> 00:05:17.958\nhopefully that search will work.\n\n00:05:17.958 --> 00:05:21.958\nAs a part of --\n\n00:05:21.958 --> 00:05:23.958\nyou know, part of what we want to do to grow our company\n\n00:05:23.958 --> 00:05:25.958\nis to have more searches.\n\n00:05:25.958 --> 00:05:27.958\nAnd what that means is we want to have\n\n00:05:27.958 --> 00:05:32.958\nmore people who are healthy and educated.\n\n00:05:32.958 --> 00:05:36.958\nMore animals, if they start doing searches as well.\n\n00:05:36.958 --> 00:05:41.958\nBut partly, we want to make the world a better place,\n\n00:05:41.958 --> 00:05:46.958\nand so one thing that we're embarking upon is the Google Foundation,\n\n00:05:46.958 --> 00:05:48.958\nand we're in the process of setting that up.\n\n00:05:48.958 --> 00:05:51.958\nWe also have a program already called Google Grants\n\n00:05:51.958 --> 00:05:54.958\nthat now serves over 150 different charities around the world,\n\n00:05:54.958 --> 00:05:56.958\nand these are some of the charities that are on there.\n\n00:05:56.958 --> 00:06:01.958\nAnd it's something I'm very excited to be a part of.\n\n00:06:01.958 --> 00:06:03.958\nIn fact, many of the organizations that are here --\n\n00:06:03.958 --> 00:06:07.958\nthe Acumen Fund, I think ApproTEC we have running, I'm not sure if that one's up yet --\n\n00:06:09.958 --> 00:06:12.958\nand many of the people who have presented here are running through Google Grants.\n\n00:06:12.958 --> 00:06:15.958\nThey run Google ads, and we just give them the ad credit\n\n00:06:15.958 --> 00:06:19.958\nso they can let organizations know.\n\n00:06:19.958 --> 00:06:21.958\nOne of the earlier results that we got --\n\n00:06:21.958 --> 00:06:24.958\nwe have a Singaporean businessman who is now sponsoring a village\n\n00:06:24.958 --> 00:06:28.958\nof 25 Vietnamese girls for their education,\n\n00:06:28.958 --> 00:06:31.958\nand that was one of the earliest results. And as I said, now there have been\n\n00:06:31.958 --> 00:06:33.958\nmany, many stories that have come in,\n\n00:06:33.958 --> 00:06:35.958\nbecause we do have hundreds of charities in there,\n\n00:06:35.958 --> 00:06:39.958\nand the Google Foundation will be an even broader endeavor.\n\n00:06:40.958 --> 00:06:42.958\nNow does anybody know who this is?\n\n00:06:46.958 --> 00:06:47.958\nA-ha!\n\n00:06:47.958 --> 00:06:48.958\nAudience: Orkut.\n\n00:06:48.958 --> 00:06:50.958\nSB: Yes! Somebody got it.\n\n00:06:50.958 --> 00:06:53.958\nThis is Orkut. Is anybody here on Orkut?\n\n00:06:53.958 --> 00:06:55.958\nDo we have any?\n\n00:06:55.958 --> 00:06:56.958\nOkay, not very many people know about it.\n\n00:06:56.958 --> 00:06:58.958\nI'll explain it in a second.\n\n00:06:58.958 --> 00:07:00.958\nThis is one of our engineers.\n\n00:07:00.958 --> 00:07:04.958\nWe find that they work better when they're submerged and covered with leaves.\n\n00:07:05.958 --> 00:07:08.958\nThat's how we churn those products out.\n\n00:07:08.958 --> 00:07:13.958\nOrkut had a vision to create a social network.\n\n00:07:13.958 --> 00:07:15.958\nI know all of you are thinking, \"Yet another social network.\"\n\n00:07:15.958 --> 00:07:18.958\nBut it was a dream of his, and we, basically,\n\n00:07:18.958 --> 00:07:21.958\nwhen people really want to do something, well, we generally let them.\n\n00:07:21.958 --> 00:07:24.958\nSo this is what he built.\n\n00:07:24.958 --> 00:07:28.958\nWe just released it in a test phase last month,\n\n00:07:28.958 --> 00:07:30.958\nand it's been taking off.\n\n00:07:30.958 --> 00:07:32.958\nThis is our VP of Engineering.\n\n00:07:32.958 --> 00:07:37.958\nYou can see the red hair, and I don't know if you can see the nose ring there.\n\n00:07:37.958 --> 00:07:40.958\nAnd these are all of his friends.\n\n00:07:40.958 --> 00:07:47.958\nSo this is how -- we just deployed it --\n\n00:07:47.958 --> 00:07:50.958\nwe just decided that people would send each other invitations to get into the service,\n\n00:07:50.958 --> 00:07:55.958\nand so we just had the people in our company initially send them out.\n\n00:07:55.958 --> 00:07:59.958\nAnd now we've grown to over 100,000 members.\n\n00:07:59.958 --> 00:08:02.958\nAnd they spread, actually, very quickly, even outside the U.S.\n\n00:08:02.958 --> 00:08:05.958\nYou can see, even though the U.S. is still the majority here --\n\n00:08:05.958 --> 00:08:09.958\nthough, by the way, search-wise, it's only about 30 percent of our traffic --\n\n00:08:09.958 --> 00:08:12.958\nbut it's already going to Japan, and the U.K., and Europe,\n\n00:08:12.958 --> 00:08:14.958\nand all the rest of the countries.\n\n00:08:14.958 --> 00:08:16.958\nSo it's a fun little project.\n\n00:08:16.958 --> 00:08:19.958\nThere are a variety of demographics. I won't bore you with these.\n\n00:08:19.958 --> 00:08:22.958\nBut it's just the kind of thing that we just try out for fun\n\n00:08:22.958 --> 00:08:24.958\nand see where it goes.\n\n00:08:24.958 --> 00:08:26.958\nAnd --\n\n00:08:26.958 --> 00:08:28.958\nwell, I'll leave you in suspense.\n\n00:08:28.958 --> 00:08:30.958\nLarry, you can explain this one.\n\n00:08:30.958 --> 00:08:33.958\nLarry Page: Thank you, Sergey.\n\n00:08:33.958 --> 00:08:35.958\nSo one of the things -- both Sergey and I\n\n00:08:35.958 --> 00:08:37.958\nwent to a Montessori school,\n\n00:08:37.958 --> 00:08:40.958\nand I think, for some reason,\n\n00:08:40.958 --> 00:08:43.958\nthis has been incorporated in Google.\n\n00:08:43.958 --> 00:08:46.958\nAnd Sergey mentioned Orkut, which is something that,\n\n00:08:46.958 --> 00:08:49.958\nyou know, Orkut wanted to do in his time,\n\n00:08:50.958 --> 00:08:53.958\nand we call this -- at Google, we've embodied this as \"the 20 percent time,\"\n\n00:08:53.958 --> 00:08:56.958\nand the idea is, for 20 percent of your time,\n\n00:08:56.958 --> 00:08:59.958\nif you're working at Google, you can do what you think is the best thing to do.\n\n00:08:59.958 --> 00:09:02.958\nAnd many, many things at Google have come out of that,\n\n00:09:03.958 --> 00:09:06.958\nsuch as Orkut and also Google News.\n\n00:09:06.958 --> 00:09:10.958\nAnd I think many other things in the world also have come out of this.\n\n00:09:10.958 --> 00:09:13.958\nMendel, who was supposed to be teaching high-school students,\n\n00:09:13.958 --> 00:09:16.958\nactually, you know, discovered the laws of genetics --\n\n00:09:16.958 --> 00:09:18.958\nas a hobby, basically.\n\n00:09:18.958 --> 00:09:22.958\nSo many, many useful things come out of this.\n\n00:09:22.958 --> 00:09:24.958\nAnd News, which I just mentioned,\n\n00:09:25.958 --> 00:09:28.958\nwas started by a researcher.\n\n00:09:28.958 --> 00:09:31.958\nAnd he just -- he -- after 9/11, he got really interested in the news.\n\n00:09:31.958 --> 00:09:36.958\nAnd he said, \"Why don't I look at the news better?\"\n\n00:09:36.958 --> 00:09:39.958\nAnd so he started clustering it by category,\n\n00:09:39.958 --> 00:09:42.958\nand then he started using it, and then his friends started using it.\n\n00:09:42.958 --> 00:09:47.958\nAnd then, besides just looking cute on a baby's bottom,\n\n00:09:47.958 --> 00:09:49.958\nwe made it a Googlette,\n\n00:09:49.958 --> 00:09:52.958\nwhich is basically a small project at Google.\n\n00:09:52.958 --> 00:09:55.958\nSo it'd be like three people, or something like that,\n\n00:09:55.958 --> 00:09:57.958\nand they would try to make a product.\n\n00:09:57.958 --> 00:09:59.958\nAnd we wouldn't really be sure if it's going to work or not.\n\n00:09:59.958 --> 00:10:03.958\nAnd in News' case, you know, they had a couple of people\n\n00:10:03.958 --> 00:10:05.958\nworking on it for a while, and then more and more people\n\n00:10:05.958 --> 00:10:07.958\nstarted using it, and then we put it out on the Internet,\n\n00:10:07.958 --> 00:10:09.958\nand more and more people started using it.\n\n00:10:09.958 --> 00:10:12.958\nAnd now it's a real, full-blown project with more people on it.\n\n00:10:12.958 --> 00:10:15.958\nAnd this is how we keep our innovation running.\n\n00:10:15.958 --> 00:10:18.958\nI think usually, as companies get bigger,\n\n00:10:18.958 --> 00:10:21.958\nthey find it really hard to have small, innovative projects.\n\n00:10:21.958 --> 00:10:24.958\nAnd we had this problem, too, for a while, and we said,\n\n00:10:24.958 --> 00:10:26.958\n\"Oh, we really need a new concept.\"\n\n00:10:26.958 --> 00:10:30.958\nYou know, the Googlettes -- that's a small project that we're not quite sure if it's going to work or not,\n\n00:10:30.958 --> 00:10:33.958\nbut we hope it will, and if we do enough of them,\n\n00:10:33.958 --> 00:10:37.958\nsome of them will really work and turn out, such as News.\n\n00:10:37.958 --> 00:10:41.958\nBut then we had a problem because then we had over 100 projects.\n\n00:10:41.958 --> 00:10:43.958\nAnd I don't know about all of you,\n\n00:10:43.958 --> 00:10:46.958\nbut I have trouble keeping 100 things in my head at once.\n\n00:10:46.958 --> 00:10:50.958\nAnd we found that if we just wrote all of them down\n\n00:10:50.958 --> 00:10:53.958\nand ordered them -- and these are kind of made up.\n\n00:10:53.958 --> 00:10:55.958\nDon't really pay attention to them.\n\n00:10:55.958 --> 00:10:58.958\nFor example, the \"Buy Iceland\" was from a media article.\n\n00:10:58.958 --> 00:11:00.958\nWe would never do such a crazy thing, but --\n\n00:11:03.958 --> 00:11:07.958\nin any case, we found if we just basically wrote them all down and ordered them,\n\n00:11:07.958 --> 00:11:11.958\nthat most people would actually agree what the ordering should be.\n\n00:11:11.958 --> 00:11:13.958\nAnd this was kind of a surprise to me, but\n\n00:11:13.958 --> 00:11:16.958\nwe found that as long as you keep the 100 things in your head,\n\n00:11:16.958 --> 00:11:18.958\nwhich you did by writing them down,\n\n00:11:18.958 --> 00:11:20.958\nthat you could do a pretty good job deciding what to do\n\n00:11:20.958 --> 00:11:23.958\nand where to put your resources.\n\n00:11:23.958 --> 00:11:25.958\nAnd so that's basically what we've done\n\n00:11:25.958 --> 00:11:29.958\nsince we instituted that a few years ago, and I think it has really allowed us to be innovative\n\n00:11:29.958 --> 00:11:32.958\nand still stay reasonably well-organized.\n\n00:11:32.958 --> 00:11:35.958\nThe other thing we discovered is that people like to work on things that are important,\n\n00:11:35.958 --> 00:11:37.958\nand so naturally,\n\n00:11:37.958 --> 00:11:43.958\npeople sort of migrate to the things that are high priorities.\n\n00:11:43.958 --> 00:11:45.958\nI just wanted to highlight a couple of things\n\n00:11:45.958 --> 00:11:48.958\nthat are new, or you might not know about.\n\n00:11:48.958 --> 00:11:51.958\nAnd the top thing, actually, is the Deskbar.\n\n00:11:51.958 --> 00:11:54.958\nSo this is a new -- how many of you use the Google Toolbar?\n\n00:11:54.958 --> 00:11:56.958\nRaise your hands.\n\n00:11:56.958 --> 00:11:59.958\nHow many of you use the Deskbar?\n\n00:11:59.958 --> 00:12:01.958\nAll right, see? You guys should try it out.\n\n00:12:01.958 --> 00:12:03.958\nBut if you go to our site and search\n\n00:12:03.958 --> 00:12:05.958\nfor \"Deskbar,\" you'll get this.\n\n00:12:05.958 --> 00:12:07.958\nAnd the idea is, instead of a toolbar, it's just present all the time\n\n00:12:07.958 --> 00:12:09.958\non your screen on the bottom,\n\n00:12:09.958 --> 00:12:12.958\nand you can do searches really easily.\n\n00:12:12.958 --> 00:12:14.958\nAnd it's sort of like a better version of the toolbar.\n\n00:12:14.958 --> 00:12:16.958\nThank you, Sergey.\n\n00:12:20.958 --> 00:12:22.958\nThis is another example of a project that somebody at Google\n\n00:12:22.958 --> 00:12:25.958\nwas really passionate about, and they just, they got going,\n\n00:12:25.958 --> 00:12:28.958\nand it's really, really a great product, and really taking off.\n\n00:12:28.958 --> 00:12:32.958\nGoogle Answers is something we started, which is really cool,\n\n00:12:32.958 --> 00:12:35.958\nwhich lets you -- for five to 100 dollars,\n\n00:12:35.958 --> 00:12:37.958\nyou can type a question in,\n\n00:12:37.958 --> 00:12:39.958\nand then there's a pool of researchers\n\n00:12:39.958 --> 00:12:43.958\nthat go out and research it for you, and it's guaranteed and all that,\n\n00:12:43.958 --> 00:12:45.958\nand you can get actually very good answers to things\n\n00:12:45.958 --> 00:12:47.958\nwithout spending all that time yourself.\n\n00:12:47.958 --> 00:12:50.958\nFroogle lets you search shopping information,\n\n00:12:50.958 --> 00:12:52.958\nand Blogger lets you publish things.\n\n00:12:52.958 --> 00:12:56.958\nBut all of these -- well, these were all sort of innovative things that we did that --\n\n00:12:56.958 --> 00:12:59.958\nyou know, we try many, many different things\n\n00:12:59.958 --> 00:13:00.958\nin our company.\n\n00:13:00.958 --> 00:13:02.958\nWe also like to innovate in our physical space,\n\n00:13:02.958 --> 00:13:05.958\nand we noticed in meetings, you know, you have to wait a long time\n\n00:13:05.958 --> 00:13:08.958\nfor projectors to turn on and off,\n\n00:13:08.958 --> 00:13:10.958\nand they're noisy, so people shut them off.\n\n00:13:10.958 --> 00:13:12.958\nAnd we didn't like that, so we actually,\n\n00:13:12.958 --> 00:13:17.958\nin maybe a couple of weeks, we built these little enclosures\n\n00:13:17.958 --> 00:13:19.958\nthat enclosed the projectors, and so we can leave them on all the time\n\n00:13:19.958 --> 00:13:22.958\nand they're completely silent.\n\n00:13:22.958 --> 00:13:24.958\nAnd as a result, we were able to build some software\n\n00:13:24.958 --> 00:13:26.958\nthat also lets us manage a meeting,\n\n00:13:26.958 --> 00:13:28.958\nso when you walk into a meeting room now,\n\n00:13:28.958 --> 00:13:30.958\nit lists all the meetings that are happening,\n\n00:13:30.958 --> 00:13:32.958\nyou can very easily take notes, and they just get emailed automatically\n\n00:13:32.958 --> 00:13:35.958\nto all the people that were present in the meeting.\n\n00:13:35.958 --> 00:13:38.958\nAnd as we become more of a global company,\n\n00:13:38.958 --> 00:13:40.958\nwe find these things really affect us --\n\n00:13:40.958 --> 00:13:43.958\nyou know, can we work effectively with people who aren't in the room?\n\n00:13:43.958 --> 00:13:46.958\nAnd things like that. And simple things like this can really make a big difference.\n\n00:13:47.958 --> 00:13:52.958\nWe also have a lot of engineers in those meetings,\n\n00:13:52.958 --> 00:13:56.958\nand they don't always do their laundry as much as they should.\n\n00:13:59.958 --> 00:14:01.958\nAnd so we found it was pretty helpful\n\n00:14:01.958 --> 00:14:05.958\nto have laundry machines, for our younger employees especially, and ...\n\n00:14:08.958 --> 00:14:11.958\nwe also allow dogs and things like that,\n\n00:14:11.958 --> 00:14:14.958\nand we've had, I think, a really fun culture at our company,\n\n00:14:14.958 --> 00:14:17.958\nwhich helps people work and enjoy what they're doing.\n\n00:14:17.958 --> 00:14:19.958\nThis is actually our \"cult picture.\"\n\n00:14:19.958 --> 00:14:21.958\nI just wanted to show quickly.\n\n00:14:24.958 --> 00:14:26.958\nWe had this on our website for a while,\n\n00:14:26.958 --> 00:14:29.958\nbut we found that after we put it on our website,\n\n00:14:29.958 --> 00:14:32.958\nwe didn't get any job applications anymore.\n\n00:14:34.958 --> 00:14:36.958\nBut anyway, every year we've taken\n\n00:14:36.958 --> 00:14:38.958\nthe whole company on a ski trip.\n\n00:14:38.958 --> 00:14:42.958\nA lot of work happens in companies from people knowing each other, and informally.\n\n00:14:42.958 --> 00:14:45.958\nAnd I think we've done a good job encouraging that.\n\n00:14:46.958 --> 00:14:48.958\nIt makes it a really fun place to work.\n\n00:14:48.958 --> 00:14:51.958\nAlong with our logos, too, which I think really embody\n\n00:14:51.958 --> 00:14:54.958\nour culture when we change things.\n\n00:14:54.958 --> 00:14:55.958\nIn the early days, we were actually advised\n\n00:14:55.958 --> 00:14:58.958\nwe should never change our logo because\n\n00:14:59.958 --> 00:15:01.958\nwe should establish our brand, you know,\n\n00:15:01.958 --> 00:15:03.958\nbecause, you know, you'd never want to change your logo.\n\n00:15:03.958 --> 00:15:05.958\nYou want it to be consistent.\n\n00:15:05.958 --> 00:15:07.958\nAnd we said, \"Well, that doesn't sound so much fun.\n\n00:15:07.958 --> 00:15:09.958\nWhy don't we try changing it every day?\"\n\n00:15:12.958 --> 00:15:15.958\nOne of the things that really excites me about what we're doing now\n\n00:15:15.958 --> 00:15:17.958\nis we have this thing called AdSense,\n\n00:15:17.958 --> 00:15:21.958\nand this is a little bit foreshadowing --\n\n00:15:21.958 --> 00:15:24.958\nthis is from before Dean dropped out.\n\n00:15:24.958 --> 00:15:26.958\nBut the idea is, like, on a newspaper, for example,\n\n00:15:26.958 --> 00:15:28.958\nwe show you relevant ads.\n\n00:15:28.958 --> 00:15:30.958\nAnd this is hard to read, but this says \"Battle for New Hampshire:\n\n00:15:30.958 --> 00:15:34.958\nHoward Dean for President\" -- articles on Howard Dean.\n\n00:15:34.958 --> 00:15:36.958\nAnd these ads are generated automatically --\n\n00:15:37.958 --> 00:15:38.958\nlike in this case, on the Washington Post --\n\n00:15:38.958 --> 00:15:40.958\nfrom the content on the site.\n\n00:15:40.958 --> 00:15:44.958\nAnd so we use our over 150,000 advertisers\n\n00:15:44.958 --> 00:15:46.958\nand millions of advertisements, so we pick the one\n\n00:15:46.958 --> 00:15:48.958\nthat's most relevant to what you're actually looking at,\n\n00:15:48.958 --> 00:15:50.958\nmuch as we do on search.\n\n00:15:50.958 --> 00:15:53.958\nSo the idea is we can make advertising useful,\n\n00:15:53.958 --> 00:15:55.958\nnot just annoying, right?\n\n00:15:55.958 --> 00:15:57.958\nAnd the nice thing about this,\n\n00:15:57.958 --> 00:15:59.958\nwe have a self-serve program,\n\n00:15:59.958 --> 00:16:02.958\nand many thousands of websites have signed up,\n\n00:16:02.958 --> 00:16:04.958\nand this let's them really make money. And I --\n\n00:16:04.958 --> 00:16:06.958\nyou know, there's a number of people I met --\n\n00:16:06.958 --> 00:16:09.958\nI met this guy who runs a conservation site at a party,\n\n00:16:09.958 --> 00:16:11.958\nand he said, \"You know, I wasn't making any money.\n\n00:16:11.958 --> 00:16:15.958\nI just put this thing on my site and I'm making 10,000 dollars a month.\n\n00:16:15.958 --> 00:16:17.958\nAnd, you know, thank you.\n\n00:16:17.958 --> 00:16:19.958\nI don't have to do my other job now.\"\n\n00:16:19.958 --> 00:16:22.958\nAnd I think this is really important for us, because it makes the Internet work better.\n\n00:16:22.958 --> 00:16:25.958\nIt makes content get better, it makes searching work better,\n\n00:16:25.958 --> 00:16:27.958\nwhen people can really make their livelihood\n\n00:16:27.958 --> 00:16:30.958\nfrom producing great content.\n\n00:16:32.958 --> 00:16:35.958\nSo this session is supposed to be about the future,\n\n00:16:35.958 --> 00:16:38.958\nso I'd thought I'd talk at least briefly about it.\n\n00:16:38.958 --> 00:16:41.958\nAnd the idea behind this is to do the perfect job doing search,\n\n00:16:41.958 --> 00:16:43.958\nyou really have to be smart.\n\n00:16:43.958 --> 00:16:46.958\nBecause you can type, you know, any kind of thing into Google,\n\n00:16:46.958 --> 00:16:49.958\nand you expect an answer back, right?\n\n00:16:49.958 --> 00:16:53.958\nBut finding things is tricky, and so you really want intelligence.\n\n00:16:53.958 --> 00:16:56.958\nAnd in fact, the ultimate search engine would be smart.\n\n00:16:56.958 --> 00:16:58.958\nIt would be artificial intelligence.\n\n00:16:58.958 --> 00:17:00.958\nAnd so that's something we work on,\n\n00:17:00.958 --> 00:17:02.958\nand we even have some people who are excited enough\n\n00:17:02.958 --> 00:17:04.958\nand crazy enough to work on it now,\n\n00:17:04.958 --> 00:17:06.958\nand that's really their goal.\n\n00:17:06.958 --> 00:17:08.958\nSo we always hope that Google will be smart,\n\n00:17:08.958 --> 00:17:11.958\nbut we're always surprised when other people think that it is.\n\n00:17:11.958 --> 00:17:14.958\nAnd so I just wanted to give a funny example of this.\n\n00:17:14.958 --> 00:17:16.958\nThis is a blog from Iraq,\n\n00:17:16.958 --> 00:17:18.958\nand it's not really what\n\n00:17:18.958 --> 00:17:20.958\nI'm going to talk about, but I just wanted to show you an example.\n\n00:17:20.958 --> 00:17:22.958\nMaybe, Sergey, you can highlight this.\n\n00:17:22.958 --> 00:17:24.958\nSo we decided --\n\n00:17:28.958 --> 00:17:31.958\nactually, the highlight's right there. Oh, thank you.\n\n00:17:33.958 --> 00:17:38.958\nSo, \"related searches,\" right there. You can't see it that well,\n\n00:17:38.958 --> 00:17:40.958\nbut we decided we should put in this feature\n\n00:17:40.958 --> 00:17:43.958\ninto our AdSense ads, called \"related searches.\"\n\n00:17:43.958 --> 00:17:46.958\nAnd so we'd say, you know, \"Did you mean 'search for'\" -- what is this,\n\n00:17:46.958 --> 00:17:49.958\nin this case, \"Saddam Hussein,\" because this blog is about Iraq --\n\n00:17:49.958 --> 00:17:51.958\nand you know, in addition to the ads,\n\n00:17:51.958 --> 00:17:54.958\nand we thought this would be a great idea.\n\n00:17:54.958 --> 00:17:56.958\nAnd so there is this blog\n\n00:17:56.958 --> 00:18:01.958\nof a young person who was kind of depressed, and he said,\n\n00:18:01.958 --> 00:18:03.958\n\"You know, I'm sleeping a lot.\"\n\n00:18:03.958 --> 00:18:05.958\nHe was just kind of writing about his life.\n\n00:18:05.958 --> 00:18:08.958\nAnd our algorithms -- not a person, of course,\n\n00:18:08.958 --> 00:18:10.958\nbut our algorithms, our computers --\n\n00:18:10.958 --> 00:18:12.958\nread his blog and decided that\n\n00:18:12.958 --> 00:18:14.958\nthe related search was, \"I am bored.\"\n\n00:18:14.958 --> 00:18:17.958\nAnd he read this, and he thought a person had decided\n\n00:18:17.958 --> 00:18:19.958\nthat he was boring,\n\n00:18:19.958 --> 00:18:22.958\nand it was very unfortunate,\n\n00:18:22.958 --> 00:18:26.958\nand he said, \"You know, what are these, you know, bastards at Google doing?\n\n00:18:26.958 --> 00:18:28.958\nWhy don't they like my blog?\"\n\n00:18:28.958 --> 00:18:30.958\nAnd so then we read his blog, which was getting -- you know,\n\n00:18:31.958 --> 00:18:34.958\nsort of going from bad to worse,\n\n00:18:34.958 --> 00:18:36.958\nand we said the related search was, \"Retards.\"\n\n00:18:39.958 --> 00:18:41.958\nAnd then, you know, he got even more mad,\n\n00:18:41.958 --> 00:18:43.958\nand he wrote -- like, started swearing and so on.\n\n00:18:43.958 --> 00:18:46.958\nAnd then we produced \"You suck.\"\n\n00:18:46.958 --> 00:18:49.958\nAnd finally, it ended with \"Kiss my ass.\"\n\n00:18:51.958 --> 00:18:53.958\nAnd so basically, he thought he was dealing with something smart,\n\n00:18:53.958 --> 00:18:55.958\nand of course, you know,\n\n00:18:55.958 --> 00:18:57.958\nwe just sort of wrote this program and we tried it out,\n\n00:18:57.958 --> 00:19:00.958\nand it didn't quite work,\n\n00:19:00.958 --> 00:19:02.958\nand we don't have this feature anymore.\n\n00:19:04.958 --> 00:19:07.958\nSo with that, maybe I can switch back to the world.\n\n00:19:07.958 --> 00:19:09.958\nI wanted to end just by saying that\n\n00:19:09.958 --> 00:19:11.958\nthere's a couple things that really make me excited\n\n00:19:11.958 --> 00:19:14.958\nto be involved with Google,\n\n00:19:14.958 --> 00:19:18.958\nand one of those is that we're able to make money\n\n00:19:18.958 --> 00:19:21.958\nlargely through advertising, and one of the benefits that I didn't expect from that\n\n00:19:21.958 --> 00:19:24.958\nwas that we're able to serve everyone in the world\n\n00:19:24.958 --> 00:19:29.958\nwithout worrying about, you know, places that don't have as much money.\n\n00:19:29.958 --> 00:19:32.958\nSo we don't have to worry about our products being sold,\n\n00:19:32.958 --> 00:19:35.958\nfor example, for less money in places that are poor,\n\n00:19:35.958 --> 00:19:37.958\nand then they get re-imported into the U.S. --\n\n00:19:37.958 --> 00:19:39.958\nfor example, with the drug industry.\n\n00:19:39.958 --> 00:19:42.958\nAnd I think we're really lucky to have that kind of business model\n\n00:19:42.958 --> 00:19:45.958\nbecause everyone in the world has access to our search,\n\n00:19:45.958 --> 00:19:48.958\nand I think that's a tremendous, tremendous benefit.\n\n00:19:48.958 --> 00:19:51.958\nThe other thing I wanted to mention just briefly\n\n00:19:51.958 --> 00:19:57.958\nis that we have a tremendous ability and responsibility\n\n00:19:57.958 --> 00:20:00.958\nto provide people the right information,\n\n00:20:00.958 --> 00:20:02.958\nand we view ourselves like a newspaper or a magazine --\n\n00:20:02.958 --> 00:20:05.958\nthat we should provide very objective information.\n\n00:20:05.958 --> 00:20:08.958\nAnd so in our search results, we never accept payment for our search results.\n\n00:20:08.958 --> 00:20:11.958\nWe accept payment for advertising,\n\n00:20:11.958 --> 00:20:13.958\nand we mark it as such.\n\n00:20:13.958 --> 00:20:15.958\nAnd that's unlike many of our competitors.\n\n00:20:15.958 --> 00:20:18.958\nAnd I think decisions we're able to make like that\n\n00:20:18.958 --> 00:20:20.958\nhave a tremendous impact on the world,\n\n00:20:20.958 --> 00:20:22.958\nand it makes me really proud to be involved with Google.\n\n00:20:22.958 --> 00:20:24.958\nSo thank you."}, {"title": "\"Black Men Ski\"", "duration": "277", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/stew_says_black_men_ski", "transcript": "Has anyone ever been to Aspen, Colorado?

ghastly tragedy of the suburbs", "duration": "1184", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/james_howard_kunstler_dissects_suburbia", "transcript": "The immersive ugliness of our everyday environments in America is entropy made visible. We can't overestimate the amount of despair that we are generating with places like this. And mostly, I want to persuade you that we have to do better if we're going to continue the project of civilization in America. By the way, this doesn't help. Nobody's having a better day down here because of that.There are a lot of ways you can describe this. You know, I like to call it \"the national automobile slum.\" You can call it suburban sprawl. I think it's appropriate to call it the greatest misallocation of resources in the history of the world. You can call it a technosis externality clusterfuck. And it's a tremendous problem for us. The outstanding \u2014 the salient problem about this for us is that these are places that are not worth caring about. We're going to talk about that some more. A sense of place: your ability to create places that are meaningful and places of quality and character depends entirely on your ability to define space with buildings, and to employ the vocabularies, grammars, syntaxes, rhythms and patterns of architecture in order to inform us who we are.The public realm in America has two roles: it is the dwelling place of our civilization and our civic life, and it is the physical manifestation of the common good. And when you degrade the public realm, you will automatically degrade the quality of your civic life and the character of all the enactments of your public life and communal life that take place there. The public realm comes mostly in the form of the street in America because we don't have the 1,000-year-old cathedral plazas and market squares of older cultures. And your ability to define space and to create places that are worth caring about all comes from a body of culture that we call the culture of civic design. This is a body of knowledge, method, skill and principle that we threw in the garbage after World War II and decided we don't need that anymore; we're not going to use it. And consequently, we can see the result all around us. The public realm has to inform us not only where we are geographically, but it has to inform us where we are in our culture. Where we've come from, what kind of people we are, and it needs to, by doing that, it needs to afford us a glimpse to where we're going in order to allow us to dwell in a hopeful present. And if there is one tremendous \u2014 if there is one great catastrophe about the places that we've built, the human environments we've made for ourselves in the last 50 years, it is that it has deprived us of the ability to live in a hopeful present.The environments we are living in, more typically, are like these. You know, this happens to be the asteroid belt of architectural garbage two miles north of my town. And remember, to create a place of character and quality, you have to be able to define space. So how is that being accomplished here? If you stand on the apron of the Wal-Mart over here and try to look at the Target store over here, you can't see it because of the curvature of the Earth. (Laughter) That's nature's way of telling you that you're doing a poor job of defining space. Consequently, these will be places that nobody wants to be in. These will be places that are not worth caring about.We have about, you know, 38,000 places that are not worth caring about in the United States today. When we have enough of them, we're going to have a nation that's not worth defending. And I want you to think about that when you think about those young men and women who are over in places like Iraq, spilling their blood in the sand, and ask yourself, \"What is their last thought of home?\" I hope it's not the curb cut between the Chuck E. Cheese and the Target store because that's not good enough for Americans to be spilling their blood for. (Applause) We need better places in this country.Public space. This is a good public space. It's a place worth caring about. It's well defined. It is emphatically an outdoor public room. It has something that is terribly important \u2014 it has what's called an active and permeable membrane around the edge. That's a fancy way of saying it's got shops, bars, bistros, destinations \u2014 things go in and out of it. It's permeable. The beer goes in and out, the waitresses go in and out, and that activates the center of this place and makes it a place that people want to hang out in. You know, in these places in other cultures, people just go there voluntarily because they like them. We don't have to have a craft fair here to get people to come here. (Laughter) You know, you don't have to have a Kwanzaa festival. People just go because it's pleasurable to be there. But this is how we do it in the United States.Probably the most significant public space failure in America, designed by the leading architects of the day, Harry Cobb and I.M. Pei: Boston City Hall Plaza. A public place so dismal that the winos don't even want to go there. (Laughter) And we can't fix it because I.M. Pei's still alive, and every year Harvard and M.I.T. have a joint committee to repair it. And every year they fail to because they don't want to hurt I.M. Pei's feelings.This is the other side of the building. This was the winner of an international design award in, I think, 1966, something like that. It wasn't Pei and Cobb, another firm designed this, but there's not enough Prozac in the world to make people feel OK about going down this block. This is the back of Boston City Hall, the most important, you know, significant civic building in Albany \u2014 excuse me \u2014 in Boston. And what is the message that is coming, what are the vocabularies and grammars that are coming, from this building and how is it informing us about who we are?This, in fact, would be a better building if we put mosaic portraits of Josef Stalin, Pol Pot, Saddam Hussein, and all the other great despots of the 20th century on the side of the building, because then we'd honestly be saying what the building is really communicating to us. You know, that it's a despotic building; it wants us to feel like termites. (Laughter) This is it on a smaller scale: the back of the civic center in my town, Saratoga Springs, New York. By the way, when I showed this slide to a group of Kiwanians in my town, they all rose in indignation from their creamed chicken, (Laughter) and they shouted at me and said, \"It was raining that day when you took that picture!\" Because this was perceived to be a weather problem. (Laughter)You know, this is a building designed like a DVD player. (Laughter) Audio jack, power supply \u2014 and look, you know these things are important architectural jobs for firms, right? You know, we hire firms to design these things. You can see exactly what went on, three o'clock in the morning at the design meeting. You know, eight hours before deadline, four architects trying to get this building in on time, right? And they're sitting there at the long boardroom table with all the drawings, and the renderings, and all the Chinese food caskets are lying on the table, and \u2014 I mean, what was the conversation that was going on there? (Laughter) Because you know what the last word was, what the last sentence was of that meeting. It was: \"Fuck it.\" (Laughter) (Applause)That \u2014 that is the message of this form of architecture. The message is: We don't give a fuck! We don't give a fuck. So I went back on the nicest day of the year, just to \u2014 you know \u2014 do some reality testing, and in fact, he will not even go down there because (Laughter) it's not interesting enough for his clients, you know, the burglars, the muggers. It's not civically rich enough for them to go down there. OK.The pattern of Main Street USA \u2014 in fact, this pattern of building downtown blocks, all over the world, is fairly universal. It's not that complicated: buildings more than one story high, built out to the sidewalk edge, so that people who are, you know, all kinds of people can get into the building. Other activities are allowed to occur upstairs, you know, apartments, offices, and so on. You make provision for this activity called shopping on the ground floor. They haven't learned that in Monterey. If you go out to the corner right at the main intersection right in front of this conference center, you'll see an intersection with four blank walls on every corner. It's really incredible.Anyway, this is how you compose and assemble a downtown business building, and this is what happened when in Glens Falls, New York, when we tried to do it again, where it was missing, right? So the first thing they do is they pop up the retail a half a story above grade to make it sporty. OK. That completely destroys the relationship between the business and the sidewalk, where the theoretical pedestrians are. (Laughter) Of course, they'll never be there, as long as this is in that condition. Then because the relationship between the retail is destroyed, we pop a handicapped ramp on that, and then to make ourselves feel better, we put a nature Band-Aid in front of it. And that's how we do it. I call them \"nature Band-Aids\" because there's a general idea in America that the remedy for mutilated urbanism is nature. And in fact, the remedy for wounded and mutilated urbanism is good urbanism, good buildings. Not just flower beds, not just cartoons of the Sierra Nevada Mountains. You know, that's not good enough. We have to do good buildings.The street trees have really four jobs to do and that's it: To spatially denote the pedestrian realm, to protect the pedestrians from the vehicles in the carriageway, to filter the sunlight onto the sidewalk, and to soften the hardscape of the buildings and to create a ceiling \u2014 a vaulted ceiling \u2014 over the street, at its best. And that's it. Those are the four jobs of the street trees. They're not supposed to be a cartoon of the North Woods; they're not supposed to be a set for \"The Last of the Mohicans.\"You know, one of the problems with the fiasco of suburbia is that it destroyed our understanding of the distinction between the country and the town, between the urban and the rural. They're not the same thing. And we're not going to cure the problems of the urban by dragging the country into the city, which is what a lot of us are trying to do all the time. Here you see it on a small scale \u2014 the mothership has landed, R2-D2 and C-3PO have stepped out to test the bark mulch to see if they can inhabit this planet. (Laughter)A lot of this comes from the fact that the industrial city in America was such a trauma that we developed this tremendous aversion for the whole idea of the city, city life, and everything connected with it. And so what you see fairly early, in the mid-19th century, is this idea that we now have to have an antidote to the industrial city, which is going to be life in the country for everybody. And that starts to be delivered in the form of the railroad suburb: the country villa along the railroad line, which allows people to enjoy the amenity of the city, but to return to the countryside every night. And believe me, there were no Wal-Marts or convenience stores out there then, so it really was a form of country living.But what happens is, of course, it mutates over the next 80 years and it turns into something rather insidious. It becomes a cartoon of a country house, in a cartoon of the country. And that's the great non-articulated agony of suburbia and one of the reasons that it lends itself to ridicule. Because it hasn't delivered what it's been promising for half a century now.And these are typically the kind of dwellings we find there, you know. Basically, a house with nothing on the side because this house wants to state, emphatically, \"I'm a little cabin in the woods. There's nothing on either side of me. I don't have any eyes on the side of my head. I can't see.\" So you have this one last facade of the house, the front, which is really a cartoon of a facade of a house. Because \u2014 notice the porch here. Unless the people that live here are Munchkins, nobody's going to be using that. This is really, in fact, a television broadcasting a show 24/7 called \"We're Normal.\" We're normal, we're normal, we're normal, we're normal, we're normal. Please respect us, we're normal, we're normal, we're normal.But we know what's going on in these houses, you know. We know that little Skippy is loading his Uzi down here, getting ready for homeroom. (Laughter) We know that Heather, his sister Heather, 14 years old, is turning tricks up here to support her drug habit. Because these places, these habitats, are inducing immense amounts of anxiety and depression in children, and they don't have a lot of experience with medication. So they take the first one that comes along, often. These are not good enough for Americans. These are the schools we are sending them to: The Hannibal Lecter Central School, Las Vegas, Nevada. This is a real school! You know, but there's obviously a notion that if you let the inmates of this thing out, that they would snatch a motorist off the street and eat his liver. So every effort is made to keep them within the building. Notice that nature is present. (Laughter)We're going to have to change this behavior whether we like it or not. We are entering an epochal period of change in the world, and \u2014 certainly in America \u2014 the period that will be characterized by the end of the cheap oil era. It is going to change absolutely everything. Chris asked me not to go on too long about this, and I won't, except to say there's not going to be a hydrogen economy. Forget it. It's not going to happen. We're going to have to do something else instead. We're going to have to down-scale, re-scale, and re-size virtually everything we do in this country and we can't start soon enough to do it. We're going to have \u2014 (Applause) \u2014 we're going to have to live closer to where we work. We're going to have to live closer to each other. We're going have to grow more food closer to where we live. The age of the 3,000 mile Caesar salad is coming to an end. We're going to have to \u2014 we have a railroad system that the Bulgarians would be ashamed of! We gotta do better than that!And we should have started two days before yesterday. We are fortunate that the new urbanists were there, for the last 10 years, excavating all that information that was thrown in the garbage by our parents' generation after World War II. Because we're going to need it if we're going to learn how to reconstruct towns. We're going to need to get back this body of methodology and principle and skill in order to re-learn how to compose meaningful places, places that are integral, that allow \u2014 that are living organisms in the sense that they contain all the organs of our civic life and our communal life, deployed in an integral fashion.So that, you know, the residences make sense deployed in relation to the places of business, of culture and of governance. We're going to have to re-learn what the building blocks of these things are: the street, the block, how to compose public space that's both large and small, the courtyard, the civic square and how to really make use of this property. We can see some of the first ideas for retro-fitting some of the catastrophic property that we have in America. The dead malls: what are we going to do with them? Well, in point of fact, most of them are not going to make it. They're not going to be retro-fitted; they're going to be the salvage yards of the future.Some of them we're going to fix, though. And we're going to fix them by imposing back on them street and block systems and returning to the building lot as the normal increment of development. And if we're lucky, the result will be revivified town centers and neighborhood centers in our existing towns and cities. And by the way, our towns and cities are where they are, and grew where they were because they occupy all the important sites. And most of them are still going to be there, although the scale of them is probably going to be diminished.We've got a lot of work to do. We're not going to be rescued by the hyper-car; we're not going to be rescued by alternative fuels. No amount or combination of alternative fuels is going to allow us to continue running what we're running, the way we're running it. We're going to have to do everything very differently. And America's not prepared. We are sleepwalking into the future. We're not ready for what's coming at us. So I urge you all to do what you can. Life in the mid-21st century is going to be about living locally. Be prepared to be good neighbors. Be prepared to find vocations that make you useful to your neighbors and to your fellow citizens.One final thing \u2014 I've been very disturbed about this for years, but I think it's particularly important for this audience. Please, please, stop referring to yourselves as \"consumers.\" OK? Consumers are different than citizens. Consumers do not have obligations, responsibilities and duties to their fellow human beings. And as long as you're using that word consumer in the public discussion, you will be degrading the quality of the discussion we're having. And we're going to continue being clueless going into this very difficult future that we face. So thank you very much. Please go out and do what you can to make this a land full of places that are worth caring about and a nation that will be worth defending.

It's permeable.\n\n00:05:33.958 --> 00:05:36.958\nThe beer goes in and out, the waitresses go in and out,\n\n00:05:36.958 --> 00:05:41.958\nand that activates the center of this place and makes it a place that people want to hang out in.\n\n00:05:41.958 --> 00:05:45.958\nYou know, in these places in other cultures,\n\n00:05:45.958 --> 00:05:49.958\npeople just go there voluntarily because they like them.\n\n00:05:49.958 --> 00:05:52.958\nWe don't have to have a craft fair here to get people to come here. (Laughter)\n\n00:05:52.958 --> 00:05:55.958\nYou know, you don't have to have a Kwanzaa festival.\n\n00:05:55.958 --> 00:05:59.958\nPeople just go because it's pleasurable to be there.\n\n00:05:59.958 --> 00:06:02.958\nBut this is how we do it in the United States.\n\n00:06:03.958 --> 00:06:06.958\nProbably the most significant public space failure in America,\n\n00:06:06.958 --> 00:06:11.958\ndesigned by the leading architects of the day, Harry Cobb and I.M. Pei:\n\n00:06:11.958 --> 00:06:13.958\nBoston City Hall Plaza.\n\n00:06:13.958 --> 00:06:19.958\nA public place so dismal that the winos don't even want to go there. (Laughter)\n\n00:06:19.958 --> 00:06:22.958\nAnd we can't fix it because I.M. Pei's still alive,\n\n00:06:22.958 --> 00:06:25.958\nand every year Harvard and M.I.T. have a joint committee to repair it.\n\n00:06:25.958 --> 00:06:29.958\nAnd every year they fail to because they don't want to hurt I.M. Pei's feelings.\n\n00:06:29.958 --> 00:06:31.958\nThis is the other side of the building.\n\n00:06:31.958 --> 00:06:36.958\nThis was the winner of an international design award in, I think, 1966, something like that.\n\n00:06:36.958 --> 00:06:39.958\nIt wasn't Pei and Cobb, another firm designed this,\n\n00:06:39.958 --> 00:06:48.958\nbut there's not enough Prozac in the world to make people feel OK about going down this block.\n\n00:06:50.958 --> 00:06:52.958\nThis is the back of Boston City Hall,\n\n00:06:52.958 --> 00:06:58.958\nthe most important, you know, significant civic building in Albany -- excuse me -- in Boston.\n\n00:07:00.958 --> 00:07:02.958\nAnd what is the message that is coming,\n\n00:07:02.958 --> 00:07:05.958\nwhat are the vocabularies and grammars that are coming, from this building\n\n00:07:05.958 --> 00:07:08.958\nand how is it informing us about who we are?\n\n00:07:08.958 --> 00:07:12.958\nThis, in fact, would be a better building if we put mosaic portraits\n\n00:07:12.958 --> 00:07:17.958\nof Josef Stalin, Pol Pot, Saddam Hussein,\n\n00:07:17.958 --> 00:07:20.958\nand all the other great despots of the 20th century on the side of the building,\n\n00:07:20.958 --> 00:07:25.958\nbecause then we'd honestly be saying what the building is really communicating to us.\n\n00:07:25.958 --> 00:07:27.958\nYou know, that it's a despotic building;\n\n00:07:27.958 --> 00:07:35.958\nit wants us to feel like termites. (Laughter)\n\n00:07:35.958 --> 00:07:37.958\nThis is it on a smaller scale:\n\n00:07:37.958 --> 00:07:40.958\nthe back of the civic center in my town, Saratoga Springs, New York.\n\n00:07:41.958 --> 00:07:46.958\nBy the way, when I showed this slide to a group of Kiwanians in my town,\n\n00:07:46.958 --> 00:07:51.958\nthey all rose in indignation from their creamed chicken, (Laughter)\n\n00:07:51.958 --> 00:07:54.958\nand they shouted at me and said,\n\n00:07:54.958 --> 00:07:58.958\n\"It was raining that day when you took that picture!\"\n\n00:07:58.958 --> 00:08:08.958\nBecause this was perceived to be a weather problem. (Laughter)\n\n00:08:10.958 --> 00:08:15.958\nYou know, this is a building designed like a DVD player. (Laughter)\n\n00:08:15.958 --> 00:08:20.958\nAudio jack, power supply --\n\n00:08:20.958 --> 00:08:25.958\nand look, you know these things are important architectural jobs for firms, right?\n\n00:08:25.958 --> 00:08:27.958\nYou know, we hire firms to design these things.\n\n00:08:27.958 --> 00:08:31.958\nYou can see exactly what went on, three o'clock in the morning at the design meeting.\n\n00:08:31.958 --> 00:08:33.958\nYou know, eight hours before deadline,\n\n00:08:33.958 --> 00:08:37.958\nfour architects trying to get this building in on time, right?\n\n00:08:37.958 --> 00:08:40.958\nAnd they're sitting there at the long boardroom table\n\n00:08:40.958 --> 00:08:42.958\nwith all the drawings, and the renderings,\n\n00:08:42.958 --> 00:08:46.958\nand all the Chinese food caskets are lying on the table, and --\n\n00:08:46.958 --> 00:08:50.958\nI mean, what was the conversation that was going on there? (Laughter)\n\n00:08:50.958 --> 00:08:55.958\nBecause you know what the last word was, what the last sentence was of that meeting.\n\n00:08:55.958 --> 00:09:02.958\nIt was: \"Fuck it.\" (Laughter) (Applause)\n\n00:09:02.958 --> 00:09:08.958\nThat -- that is the message of this form of architecture.\n\n00:09:08.958 --> 00:09:13.958\nThe message is: We don't give a fuck! We don't give a fuck.\n\n00:09:14.958 --> 00:09:17.958\nSo I went back on the nicest day of the year, just to --\n\n00:09:17.958 --> 00:09:19.958\nyou know -- do some reality testing,\n\n00:09:19.958 --> 00:09:23.958\nand in fact, he will not even go down there because (Laughter)\n\n00:09:23.958 --> 00:09:25.958\nit's not interesting enough for his clients,\n\n00:09:25.958 --> 00:09:28.958\nyou know, the burglars, the muggers.\n\n00:09:28.958 --> 00:09:32.958\nIt's not civically rich enough for them to go down there.\n\n00:09:33.958 --> 00:09:34.958\nOK.\n\n00:09:35.958 --> 00:09:37.958\nThe pattern of Main Street USA --\n\n00:09:38.958 --> 00:09:43.958\nin fact, this pattern of building downtown blocks, all over the world, is fairly universal.\n\n00:09:43.958 --> 00:09:45.958\nIt's not that complicated:\n\n00:09:45.958 --> 00:09:51.958\nbuildings more than one story high, built out to the sidewalk edge,\n\n00:09:51.958 --> 00:09:54.958\nso that people who are, you know, all kinds of people can get into the building.\n\n00:09:54.958 --> 00:09:58.958\nOther activities are allowed to occur upstairs,\n\n00:09:58.958 --> 00:10:01.958\nyou know, apartments, offices, and so on.\n\n00:10:01.958 --> 00:10:05.958\nYou make provision for this activity called shopping on the ground floor.\n\n00:10:05.958 --> 00:10:07.958\nThey haven't learned that in Monterey.\n\n00:10:07.958 --> 00:10:11.958\nIf you go out to the corner right at the main intersection right in front of this conference center,\n\n00:10:11.958 --> 00:10:14.958\nyou'll see an intersection with four blank walls on every corner.\n\n00:10:14.958 --> 00:10:16.958\nIt's really incredible.\n\n00:10:16.958 --> 00:10:20.958\nAnyway, this is how you compose and assemble a downtown business building,\n\n00:10:20.958 --> 00:10:23.958\nand this is what happened when in Glens Falls, New York,\n\n00:10:23.958 --> 00:10:25.958\nwhen we tried to do it again, where it was missing, right?\n\n00:10:25.958 --> 00:10:31.958\nSo the first thing they do is they pop up the retail a half a story above grade to make it sporty.\n\n00:10:31.958 --> 00:10:37.958\nOK. That completely destroys the relationship between the business and the sidewalk,\n\n00:10:37.958 --> 00:10:40.958\nwhere the theoretical pedestrians are. (Laughter)\n\n00:10:40.958 --> 00:10:44.958\nOf course, they'll never be there, as long as this is in that condition.\n\n00:10:44.958 --> 00:10:48.958\nThen because the relationship between the retail is destroyed,\n\n00:10:48.958 --> 00:10:51.958\nwe pop a handicapped ramp on that,\n\n00:10:51.958 --> 00:10:55.958\nand then to make ourselves feel better, we put a nature Band-Aid in front of it.\n\n00:10:55.958 --> 00:10:57.958\nAnd that's how we do it.\n\n00:10:57.958 --> 00:11:01.958\nI call them \"nature Band-Aids\" because there's a general idea in America\n\n00:11:01.958 --> 00:11:06.958\nthat the remedy for mutilated urbanism is nature.\n\n00:11:06.958 --> 00:11:13.958\nAnd in fact, the remedy for wounded and mutilated urbanism is good urbanism, good buildings.\n\n00:11:13.958 --> 00:11:19.958\nNot just flower beds, not just cartoons of the Sierra Nevada Mountains.\n\n00:11:19.958 --> 00:11:20.958\nYou know, that's not good enough.\n\n00:11:20.958 --> 00:11:22.958\nWe have to do good buildings.\n\n00:11:22.958 --> 00:11:25.958\nThe street trees have really four jobs to do and that's it:\n\n00:11:25.958 --> 00:11:28.958\nTo spatially denote the pedestrian realm,\n\n00:11:28.958 --> 00:11:33.958\nto protect the pedestrians from the vehicles in the carriageway,\n\n00:11:33.958 --> 00:11:36.958\nto filter the sunlight onto the sidewalk,\n\n00:11:36.958 --> 00:11:38.958\nand to soften the hardscape of the buildings\n\n00:11:38.958 --> 00:11:42.958\nand to create a ceiling -- a vaulted ceiling -- over the street, at its best.\n\n00:11:42.958 --> 00:11:46.958\nAnd that's it. Those are the four jobs of the street trees.\n\n00:11:46.958 --> 00:11:49.958\nThey're not supposed to be a cartoon of the North Woods;\n\n00:11:49.958 --> 00:11:54.958\nthey're not supposed to be a set for \"The Last of the Mohicans.\"\n\n00:11:54.958 --> 00:12:02.958\nYou know, one of the problems with the fiasco of suburbia is that it destroyed our understanding\n\n00:12:02.958 --> 00:12:06.958\nof the distinction between the country and the town, between the urban and the rural.\n\n00:12:06.958 --> 00:12:08.958\nThey're not the same thing.\n\n00:12:08.958 --> 00:12:12.958\nAnd we're not going to cure the problems of the urban by dragging the country into the city,\n\n00:12:12.958 --> 00:12:14.958\nwhich is what a lot of us are trying to do all the time.\n\n00:12:14.958 --> 00:12:18.958\nHere you see it on a small scale -- the mothership has landed,\n\n00:12:18.958 --> 00:12:24.958\nR2-D2 and C-3PO have stepped out to test the bark mulch\n\n00:12:24.958 --> 00:12:27.958\nto see if they can inhabit this planet. (Laughter)\n\n00:12:29.958 --> 00:12:34.958\nA lot of this comes from the fact that the industrial city in America was such a trauma\n\n00:12:34.958 --> 00:12:38.958\nthat we developed this tremendous aversion for the whole idea of the city,\n\n00:12:38.958 --> 00:12:40.958\ncity life, and everything connected with it.\n\n00:12:40.958 --> 00:12:45.958\nAnd so what you see fairly early, in the mid-19th century,\n\n00:12:45.958 --> 00:12:49.958\nis this idea that we now have to have an antidote to the industrial city,\n\n00:12:49.958 --> 00:12:52.958\nwhich is going to be life in the country for everybody.\n\n00:12:52.958 --> 00:12:56.958\nAnd that starts to be delivered in the form of the railroad suburb:\n\n00:12:56.958 --> 00:12:59.958\nthe country villa along the railroad line,\n\n00:12:59.958 --> 00:13:02.958\nwhich allows people to enjoy the amenity of the city,\n\n00:13:02.958 --> 00:13:04.958\nbut to return to the countryside every night.\n\n00:13:04.958 --> 00:13:07.958\nAnd believe me, there were no Wal-Marts or convenience stores out there then,\n\n00:13:07.958 --> 00:13:09.958\nso it really was a form of country living.\n\n00:13:09.958 --> 00:13:13.958\nBut what happens is, of course, it mutates over the next 80 years\n\n00:13:13.958 --> 00:13:15.958\nand it turns into something rather insidious.\n\n00:13:15.958 --> 00:13:20.958\nIt becomes a cartoon of a country house, in a cartoon of the country.\n\n00:13:20.958 --> 00:13:25.958\nAnd that's the great non-articulated agony of suburbia\n\n00:13:25.958 --> 00:13:27.958\nand one of the reasons that it lends itself to ridicule.\n\n00:13:27.958 --> 00:13:32.958\nBecause it hasn't delivered what it's been promising for half a century now.\n\n00:13:32.958 --> 00:13:36.958\nAnd these are typically the kind of dwellings we find there, you know.\n\n00:13:36.958 --> 00:13:39.958\nBasically, a house with nothing on the side\n\n00:13:39.958 --> 00:13:41.958\nbecause this house wants to state, emphatically,\n\n00:13:41.958 --> 00:13:44.958\n\"I'm a little cabin in the woods. There's nothing on either side of me.\n\n00:13:44.958 --> 00:13:47.958\nI don't have any eyes on the side of my head. I can't see.\"\n\n00:13:48.958 --> 00:13:50.958\nSo you have this one last facade of the house,\n\n00:13:50.958 --> 00:13:53.958\nthe front, which is really a cartoon of a facade of a house.\n\n00:13:53.958 --> 00:13:55.958\nBecause -- notice the porch here.\n\n00:13:55.958 --> 00:14:02.958\nUnless the people that live here are Munchkins, nobody's going to be using that.\n\n00:14:02.958 --> 00:14:08.958\nThis is really, in fact, a television broadcasting a show 24/7 called \"We're Normal.\"\n\n00:14:08.958 --> 00:14:11.958\nWe're normal, we're normal, we're normal, we're normal, we're normal.\n\n00:14:11.958 --> 00:14:13.958\nPlease respect us, we're normal, we're normal, we're normal.\n\n00:14:13.958 --> 00:14:15.958\nBut we know what's going on in these houses, you know.\n\n00:14:15.958 --> 00:14:19.958\nWe know that little Skippy is loading his Uzi down here,\n\n00:14:19.958 --> 00:14:23.958\ngetting ready for homeroom. (Laughter)\n\n00:14:23.958 --> 00:14:26.958\nWe know that Heather, his sister Heather, 14 years old,\n\n00:14:26.958 --> 00:14:29.958\nis turning tricks up here to support her drug habit.\n\n00:14:29.958 --> 00:14:32.958\nBecause these places, these habitats,\n\n00:14:32.958 --> 00:14:37.958\nare inducing immense amounts of anxiety and depression in children,\n\n00:14:37.958 --> 00:14:41.958\nand they don't have a lot of experience with medication.\n\n00:14:41.958 --> 00:14:43.958\nSo they take the first one that comes along, often.\n\n00:14:43.958 --> 00:14:45.958\nThese are not good enough for Americans.\n\n00:14:45.958 --> 00:14:48.958\nThese are the schools we are sending them to:\n\n00:14:48.958 --> 00:14:54.958\nThe Hannibal Lecter Central School, Las Vegas, Nevada.\n\n00:14:54.958 --> 00:14:56.958\nThis is a real school!\n\n00:14:56.958 --> 00:15:00.958\nYou know, but there's obviously a notion that if you let the inmates of this thing out,\n\n00:15:00.958 --> 00:15:04.958\nthat they would snatch a motorist off the street and eat his liver.\n\n00:15:04.958 --> 00:15:09.958\nSo every effort is made to keep them within the building.\n\n00:15:09.958 --> 00:15:15.958\nNotice that nature is present. (Laughter)\n\n00:15:16.958 --> 00:15:18.958\nWe're going to have to change this behavior whether we like it or not.\n\n00:15:18.958 --> 00:15:23.958\nWe are entering an epochal period of change in the world, and -- certainly in America\n\n00:15:23.958 --> 00:15:28.958\n-- the period that will be characterized by the end of the cheap oil era.\n\n00:15:28.958 --> 00:15:32.958\nIt is going to change absolutely everything.\n\n00:15:32.958 --> 00:15:35.958\nChris asked me not to go on too long about this, and I won't,\n\n00:15:35.958 --> 00:15:38.958\nexcept to say there's not going to be a hydrogen economy.\n\n00:15:38.958 --> 00:15:40.958\nForget it. It's not going to happen.\n\n00:15:40.958 --> 00:15:42.958\nWe're going to have to do something else instead.\n\n00:15:42.958 --> 00:15:47.958\nWe're going to have to down-scale, re-scale, and re-size\n\n00:15:47.958 --> 00:15:51.958\nvirtually everything we do in this country and we can't start soon enough to do it.\n\n00:15:51.958 --> 00:15:55.958\nWe're going to have -- (Applause) -- we're going to have to live closer to where we work.\n\n00:15:55.958 --> 00:15:57.958\nWe're going to have to live closer to each other.\n\n00:15:57.958 --> 00:16:01.958\nWe're going have to grow more food closer to where we live.\n\n00:16:01.958 --> 00:16:06.958\nThe age of the 3,000 mile Caesar salad is coming to an end.\n\n00:16:06.958 --> 00:16:11.958\nWe're going to have to -- we have a railroad system that the Bulgarians would be ashamed of!\n\n00:16:11.958 --> 00:16:13.958\nWe gotta do better than that!\n\n00:16:13.958 --> 00:16:16.958\nAnd we should have started two days before yesterday.\n\n00:16:16.958 --> 00:16:21.958\nWe are fortunate that the new urbanists were there, for the last 10 years,\n\n00:16:21.958 --> 00:16:25.958\nexcavating all that information that was thrown in the garbage\n\n00:16:25.958 --> 00:16:28.958\nby our parents' generation after World War II.\n\n00:16:28.958 --> 00:16:30.958\nBecause we're going to need it if we're going to learn how to reconstruct towns.\n\n00:16:30.958 --> 00:16:36.958\nWe're going to need to get back this body of methodology and principle and skill\n\n00:16:36.958 --> 00:16:42.958\nin order to re-learn how to compose meaningful places, places that are integral,\n\n00:16:42.958 --> 00:16:49.958\nthat allow -- that are living organisms in the sense that they contain all the organs of our civic life\n\n00:16:49.958 --> 00:16:54.958\nand our communal life, deployed in an integral fashion.\n\n00:16:54.958 --> 00:16:57.958\nSo that, you know, the residences make sense\n\n00:16:57.958 --> 00:17:02.958\ndeployed in relation to the places of business, of culture and of governance.\n\n00:17:02.958 --> 00:17:06.958\nWe're going to have to re-learn what the building blocks of these things are:\n\n00:17:06.958 --> 00:17:12.958\nthe street, the block, how to compose public space that's both large and small,\n\n00:17:12.958 --> 00:17:15.958\nthe courtyard, the civic square\n\n00:17:15.958 --> 00:17:18.958\nand how to really make use of this property.\n\n00:17:18.958 --> 00:17:21.958\nWe can see some of the first ideas\n\n00:17:21.958 --> 00:17:26.958\nfor retro-fitting some of the catastrophic property that we have in America.\n\n00:17:26.958 --> 00:17:29.958\nThe dead malls: what are we going to do with them?\n\n00:17:29.958 --> 00:17:31.958\nWell, in point of fact, most of them are not going to make it.\n\n00:17:31.958 --> 00:17:33.958\nThey're not going to be retro-fitted;\n\n00:17:33.958 --> 00:17:35.958\nthey're going to be the salvage yards of the future.\n\n00:17:35.958 --> 00:17:37.958\nSome of them we're going to fix, though.\n\n00:17:37.958 --> 00:17:41.958\nAnd we're going to fix them by imposing back on them street and block systems\n\n00:17:41.958 --> 00:17:46.958\nand returning to the building lot as the normal increment of development.\n\n00:17:47.958 --> 00:17:53.958\nAnd if we're lucky, the result will be revivified town centers and neighborhood centers\n\n00:17:53.958 --> 00:17:55.958\nin our existing towns and cities.\n\n00:17:55.958 --> 00:18:00.958\nAnd by the way, our towns and cities are where they are, and grew where they were\n\n00:18:00.958 --> 00:18:02.958\nbecause they occupy all the important sites.\n\n00:18:02.958 --> 00:18:05.958\nAnd most of them are still going to be there,\n\n00:18:05.958 --> 00:18:10.958\nalthough the scale of them is probably going to be diminished.\n\n00:18:10.958 --> 00:18:12.958\nWe've got a lot of work to do.\n\n00:18:12.958 --> 00:18:17.958\nWe're not going to be rescued by the hyper-car; we're not going to be rescued by alternative fuels.\n\n00:18:17.958 --> 00:18:20.958\nNo amount or combination of alternative fuels\n\n00:18:20.958 --> 00:18:24.958\nis going to allow us to continue running what we're running, the way we're running it.\n\n00:18:24.958 --> 00:18:27.958\nWe're going to have to do everything very differently.\n\n00:18:27.958 --> 00:18:29.958\nAnd America's not prepared.\n\n00:18:29.958 --> 00:18:32.958\nWe are sleepwalking into the future.\n\n00:18:32.958 --> 00:18:35.958\nWe're not ready for what's coming at us.\n\n00:18:35.958 --> 00:18:38.958\nSo I urge you all to do what you can.\n\n00:18:38.958 --> 00:18:45.958\nLife in the mid-21st century is going to be about living locally.\n\n00:18:45.958 --> 00:18:47.958\nBe prepared to be good neighbors.\n\n00:18:48.958 --> 00:18:53.958\nBe prepared to find vocations that make you useful\n\n00:18:53.958 --> 00:18:55.958\nto your neighbors and to your fellow citizens.\n\n00:18:55.958 --> 00:18:58.958\nOne final thing -- I've been very disturbed about this for years,\n\n00:18:58.958 --> 00:19:01.958\nbut I think it's particularly important for this audience.\n\n00:19:01.958 --> 00:19:06.958\nPlease, please, stop referring to yourselves as \"consumers.\" OK?\n\n00:19:07.958 --> 00:19:09.958\nConsumers are different than citizens.\n\n00:19:09.958 --> 00:19:14.958\nConsumers do not have obligations, responsibilities and duties\n\n00:19:14.958 --> 00:19:16.958\nto their fellow human beings.\n\n00:19:16.958 --> 00:19:19.958\nAnd as long as you're using that word consumer in the public discussion,\n\n00:19:19.958 --> 00:19:23.958\nyou will be degrading the quality of the discussion we're having.\n\n00:19:23.958 --> 00:19:26.958\nAnd we're going to continue being clueless\n\n00:19:26.958 --> 00:19:29.958\ngoing into this very difficult future that we face.\n\n00:19:29.958 --> 00:19:30.958\nSo thank you very much.\n\n00:19:30.958 --> 00:19:36.958\nPlease go out and do what you can to make this a land full of places that are worth caring about\n\n00:19:36.958 --> 00:19:39.958\nand a nation that will be worth defending. (Applause)"}, {"title": "Human-centered design", "duration": "1020", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/david_kelley_on_human_centered_design", "transcript": "There's a lot of exciting things happening in the design world and at IDEO this past year, and I'm pleased to get a chance to share some of those with you.I didn't attend the first TED back in 1984 but I've been to a lot of them since that time. I thought it [would] kind of be interesting to think back to that time when Richard got the whole thing started. Thank you very much, Richard; it's been a big, enjoyable part of my life, coming here.And so thinking back, I was thinking those of us in Silicon Valley were really focused on products or objects \u2014 certainly technological objects. And so it was great fun in those days, and some of those of you who are in the audience were my clients. We'd come in with some prototype underneath a black cloth and we'd put it on the conference table, and we'd pull off the black cloth and everybody would \"ooh\" and \"ah.\" That was a really good time.And so we'll continue to focus on products, as we always have. And if you were here last year, I probably wrestled you to the floor and tried to show you my new EyeModule 2, which was a camera that plugged into the Handspring. And I took a lot of pictures last year; very few people knew what I was up to, but I took a lot of pictures. This year \u2014 maybe you could show the slides \u2014 this year we're carrying this Treo, which we had a lot to do with and helped Handspring design it. Also, though we designed it a few years ago \u2014 it's just become ubiquitous in the last year or so \u2014 this Heartstream defibrillator which is saving lives. Maybe you've seen them in the airports? They seem to be everywhere now. Lots of lives are being saved by those. And, we're just about to announce the Zinio Reader product that I believe will make magazines even more enjoyable to read. So, we really will continue to focus on products.But something's happened in the last 18 years since Richard started TED, and that's that people like us \u2014 I know people in other places have caught onto this for a long time, but for us, we've really just started ... we've kind of climbed Maslow's hierarchy a little bit \u2014 and so we're now focused more and more on human-centered design, human-centeredness in an approach to design. That really involves designing behaviors and personality into products. And I think you're starting to see that, and it's making our job even more enjoyable.Interestingly enough, we used to primarily build 3-D models \u2014 you know, you've seen some today \u2014 and 3-D renderings. Then we'd go and we'd show those as communicating our ideas. But firms like ours are having to move to a point where we get those objects that we're designing and get them in motion, showing how they'll be used. And so in order to do that we've been forming internal video-production groups in order to make these kind of experience prototypes that show just what we mean about the man-machine relationship. And it's a much better way to see. It's kind of like architects who show people in their houses, as opposed to them being empty.So I thought that I would show you a few videos to show off this new, broader definition of design in products and services and environments. I have a few of them \u2014 they're no more than a minute or a minute-and-a-half apiece \u2014 but I thought you might be interested in seeing some of our work over the last year, and how it responds in video.So, Prada New York: we were asked by Rem Koolhaas and OMA to help us conceive the technology that's in their retail store in New York. He wanted a new kind of store \u2014 a new one \u2014 a store that had a cultural role as well as a retail one. And that meant actually designing custom technology as opposed to just buying things off the shelf and putting them to use.So, there're lots of things. Everything has RF tags: there's RF tags on the user, on the cards, there's the staff devices that are all around the store. You pick them up, and once you see something that you're interested in, the staff person can scan them in and then they can be shown on any screen throughout the store. You can look at color, and sizes, and how it appeared on the runway, or whatever. And so then the object \u2014 the merchandise that you're interested in \u2014 can be scanned. It's taken into the dressing room, and in the dressing room there are scanners so that we know exactly what clothing you have in the dressing room. We can put that up on a touch screen and you can play with that, and get more information about the clothing that you're interested in as you're trying it on. It's been used a lot of places, but I particularly like the use here of liquid crystal displays in the changing room.The last time I went to see this store, there was a huge buzz about people standing outside and wondering, \"Am I going to actually get to see the people changing clothes here?\" But if you push the button, of course, the whole wall goes dark. So you can try to get approval, or not, for whatever you're wearing. And then one of my favorite features of the technology is the magic mirror, where you put on the clothes. There's a big display in the mirror, and you can turn around \u2014 but there's a three second delay. So you can see what you look like from the back or all the way around, as you look. (Applause)About a year and a half ago we were asked to design an installation in the museum \u2014 this is a new wing of the Science Museum in London, and it's primarily about digital and biomedical issues. And a group at Itch, which is now part of IDEO, designed this interactive wall that's about four stories tall. I don't know if anybody's seen this \u2014 it's pretty spectacular in the room.Anyway, it's based on the London subway system. And so you can see that the goal is to bring some of the feedback that the people who had gone to the museum were giving, and get it up on the wall so everybody could see. Just for everybody to see. So you enter your information. Then, like the London tube system, the little trains go around with what you're thinking about. And then when you get to a station, it's expanded so that you can actually read it.Then when you exit the IMAX theatre on the fourth floor \u2014 mostly teenagers coming out of there \u2014 there's this big open space that has these tables in it that have interactive games which are quite fun, also designed by Durrell [Bishop] and Andrew [Hirniak] of Itch. And the topics include things that the museum is about: male fertility, choosing the sex of your baby or what a driverless car might be like. There's lots of room, so people can come up and understand what it is before they get involved.And also, it's not shown in the video, but these are very beautiful. They go to the top of the wall and when they reach all the way to the top, after they've bounced around, they disperse into bits and go off into the atmosphere.The next video is not done by us. This is CBS Sunday Morning that aired about two weeks ago. Scott Adams ran into us and asked us if we wouldn't help to design the ultimate cubicle for Dilbert, which sounded like a fun thing and so we couldn't pass it up. He's always been interested in technology in the future.(Video: Scott Adams: I realized that at some point I might be the world's expert on what's wrong with cubicles. So we thought, well, wouldn't it be fun to get together with some of the smartest design guys in the world and try to figure out if we could make the cubicle better?Narrator: Though they work in a wide-open office space spectacularly set under San Francisco's Oakland Bay Bridge, the team built their own little cubicles to fully experience the problems.Woman: A one-way mirror. I can look out; you can look at yourself.Narrator: They took pictures.Woman: You feel so trapped, when someone kind of leans over and you're sort of held captive there for a minute.SA: So far it's chaos, but a lot of people are doing stuff, so that's good. We'll see what happens.Narrator: The first group builds a cubicle in which the walls are screens for the computer and for family photos. In the second group's scenario, the walls are alive and actually give Dilbert a group hug. (Laughter) Behind the humor is the idea of making the cubicle more human.)David Kelley: So here's the final thing, complete with orange lighting that follows the sun across \u2014 that follows the tracks of the sun \u2014 across the sky. So you feel that in your cubicle. And my favorite feature, which is a flower in a vase that wilts when you leave in disappointment, and then when you come back, it comes up to greet you, happy to see you.(SA: The storage is built right into the wall.)DK: You know, it has homey touches like a built-in fish tank in the walls, or something to be aggressive with to release tension.(SA: Customizable for the boss of your choice.)DK: And of course: a hammock for your afternoon nap that stretches across your cubicle.(SA: Life would be sweet in a cubicle like this.)DK: This next project, we were asked to design a pavilion to celebrate the recycling of the water on the Millennium Dome in London. The dome has an incredible amount of water that washes off of it, as well as wastewater. So this building actually celebrates the water as it comes out of the recycling plant and goes into the reed bed so that it can be filtered for the final time.The pavilion's design goal was to be kind of quiet and peaceful. In contrast to if you went inside the dome, where it's kind of wild and crazy and everybody's learning all kinds of things, or fooling around, or whatever they're doing. But it was intended to be quite quiet. And then you would wander around and gather information, in a straightforward fashion, about the recycling process and what's being done, and how they're going to reuse the water once it comes through the plant. And then, if you saw, the panels actually rotate. So you can get the information on the front side, but as they rotate, you can see the actual recycling plant behind, with all the machines as they actually process the water. You can see: there's the plant. These are all very low-budget videos, like quick prototypes.And we're announcing a new product here tonight, which is the first time this has ever been shown in public. It's called Spyfish, and it's a company called H2Eye, started by Nigel Jagger in London. And it's a company that's trying to bring the experience \u2014 many people have boats, or enjoy being on boats, but a very small percentage of people actually have the capability or the interest in going under the water and actually seeing what's there, and enjoying what scuba divers do. This product, it has two cameras. You throw it over the side of your boat and you basically scuba dive without getting wet.For us \u2014 there's the object \u2014 for us, it was two projects. One, to design the interface so that the interface doesn't get in your way. You could have that kind of immersive experience of being underwater \u2014 of feeling like you're underwater \u2014 seeing what's going on. And the other one was to design the object and make sure that it was a consumer product and not a research tool. And so we spent a lot of time \u2014 this has been going on for about seven or eight years, this project \u2014 and [we're] just ready to start building them.(Narrator: The Spyfish is a revolutionary subaquatic video camera. It can dive to 500 feet, to where sunlight does not penetrate, and is equipped with powerful lights. It becomes your eyes and ears as you venture into the deep. The battery-powered Spyfish sends the live video-feed through a slender cable.)DK: This slender cable was a huge technological advancement and it allowed the whole thing to be the size that it is.(Narrator: And this central box connects the whole system together. Maneuvering the Spyfish is simple with the wireless remote control. You watch the video with superimposed graphics that indicate your depth and compass heading. The fluid graphics and ambient sounds combine to help you completely lose yourself underwater.) (Applause)DK: And the last thing I'll talk about is ApproTEC, which is a project that I'm very excited about. ApproTEC is a company started by Dr. Martin Fisher, who's a good friend of mine. He's a Ph.D. from Stanford. He found himself in Kenya on a Fulbright and he had a very interesting insight, which is that he said, \"There must be entrepreneurs in Kenya; there must be entrepreneurs everywhere.\" And he noticed that for weddings and funerals there they could find enough money to put something together. So he decided to start manufacturing products in Kenya with Kenyan manufacturers \u2014 designed by people like us, but taken there. And to this date \u2014 he's been gone for only a few years \u2014 he's started 19,000 companies. He's made 30,000 new jobs. And just the sales of the products \u2014 this is a non-profit \u2014 the sales of these products is now .6% of the GDP of Kenya. This is one guy doing this. This is a pretty spectacular thing.So we're in the process of helping them design deep-well, low-cost manual pumps in order for these people who have a quarter acre of land to be able to grow crops in the off-season. What they do now is: they can grow crops in the rainy season but they can't grow them in the off-season. And so by doing that, the woman that you saw in the first thing \u2014 she's a school teacher \u2014 always wanted to send her kids to college and she's going to be able to do it because of these things. So with seed-squeezers, and pumps, and hay-balers and very straightforward things that we're designing \u2014 my students are doing this as class projects and IDEO has donated their time to do this kind of work \u2014 it's really amazing to see his success, Martin's.We also were thinking about the experience of Richard, and so \u2014 (Laughter) \u2014 we designed this hat, because I knew I'd be the last one in the day and I needed to deal with him. So I just have one more thing to say. (Laughter) Can you read it? (Laughter) Well, it's always kind of funny when he comes up and hovers. You know, you don't want to be rude to him and you don't want to feel guilty, and so I thought this would do it, where I just sit here. (Laughter) (Applause)So we saw a lot of interesting things being designed today in this session, and from all the different presenters. And in my own practice, from product to ApproTEC, it's really exciting that we're taking a more human-centered approach to design, that we're including behaviors and personalities in the things we do, and I think this is great. Designers are more trusted and more integrated into the business strategy of companies, and I have to say, for one, I feel very lucky at the progress that design has made since the first TED.

Thank you very much, Richard;\n\n00:00:34.958 --> 00:00:37.958\nit's been a big, enjoyable part of my life, coming here.\n\n00:00:37.958 --> 00:00:40.958\nAnd so thinking back, I was thinking\n\n00:00:40.958 --> 00:00:46.958\nthose of us in Silicon Valley were really focused on products or objects --\n\n00:00:46.958 --> 00:00:48.958\ncertainly technological objects.\n\n00:00:48.958 --> 00:00:53.958\nAnd so it was great fun in those days, and some of those of you\n\n00:00:53.958 --> 00:00:55.958\nwho are in the audience were my clients.\n\n00:00:55.958 --> 00:00:59.958\nWe'd come in with some prototype underneath a black cloth\n\n00:00:59.958 --> 00:01:01.958\nand we'd put it on the conference table,\n\n00:01:01.958 --> 00:01:05.958\nand we'd pull off the black cloth and everybody would \"ooh\" and \"ah.\"\n\n00:01:05.958 --> 00:01:07.958\nThat was a really good time.\n\n00:01:07.958 --> 00:01:11.958\nAnd so we'll continue to focus on products, as we always have.\n\n00:01:11.958 --> 00:01:15.958\nAnd if you were here last year,\n\n00:01:15.958 --> 00:01:20.958\nI probably wrestled you to the floor and tried to show you my new EyeModule 2,\n\n00:01:20.958 --> 00:01:24.958\nwhich was a camera that plugged into the Handspring.\n\n00:01:24.958 --> 00:01:26.958\nAnd I took a lot of pictures last year;\n\n00:01:26.958 --> 00:01:29.958\nvery few people knew what I was up to, but I took a lot of pictures.\n\n00:01:29.958 --> 00:01:34.958\nThis year -- maybe you could show the slides --\n\n00:01:34.958 --> 00:01:37.958\nthis year we're carrying this Treo, which we had a lot to do with\n\n00:01:37.958 --> 00:01:39.958\nand helped Handspring design it.\n\n00:01:39.958 --> 00:01:42.958\nAlso, though we designed it a few years ago --\n\n00:01:42.958 --> 00:01:44.958\nit's just become ubiquitous in the last year or so --\n\n00:01:44.958 --> 00:01:46.958\nthis Heartstream defibrillator which is saving lives.\n\n00:01:46.958 --> 00:01:49.958\nMaybe you've seen them in the airports? They seem to be everywhere now.\n\n00:01:49.958 --> 00:01:51.958\nLots of lives are being saved by those.\n\n00:01:51.958 --> 00:01:57.958\nAnd, we're just about to announce the Zinio Reader product\n\n00:01:57.958 --> 00:02:01.958\nthat I believe will make magazines even more enjoyable to read.\n\n00:02:01.958 --> 00:02:04.958\nSo, we really will continue to focus on products.\n\n00:02:04.958 --> 00:02:08.958\nBut something's happened in the last 18 years since Richard started TED,\n\n00:02:08.958 --> 00:02:10.958\nand that's that people like us --\n\n00:02:10.958 --> 00:02:13.958\nI know people in other places have caught onto this for a long time,\n\n00:02:13.958 --> 00:02:19.958\nbut for us, we've really just started ... we've kind of\n\n00:02:19.958 --> 00:02:22.958\nclimbed Maslow's hierarchy a little bit --\n\n00:02:22.958 --> 00:02:26.958\nand so we're now focused more and more on human-centered design,\n\n00:02:26.958 --> 00:02:31.958\nhuman-centeredness in an approach to design.\n\n00:02:31.958 --> 00:02:36.958\nThat really involves designing behaviors and personality into products.\n\n00:02:36.958 --> 00:02:38.958\nAnd I think you're starting to see that,\n\n00:02:38.958 --> 00:02:41.958\nand it's making our job even more enjoyable.\n\n00:02:41.958 --> 00:02:47.958\nInterestingly enough, we used to primarily build 3-D models --\n\n00:02:47.958 --> 00:02:51.958\nyou know, you've seen some today -- and 3-D renderings.\n\n00:02:51.958 --> 00:02:55.958\nThen we'd go and we'd show those as communicating our ideas.\n\n00:02:55.958 --> 00:02:58.958\nBut firms like ours are having to move to a point where\n\n00:02:58.958 --> 00:03:02.958\nwe get those objects that we're designing and get them in motion,\n\n00:03:02.958 --> 00:03:04.958\nshowing how they'll be used.\n\n00:03:04.958 --> 00:03:08.958\nAnd so in order to do that we've been forming\n\n00:03:08.958 --> 00:03:11.958\ninternal video-production groups\n\n00:03:11.958 --> 00:03:14.958\nin order to make these kind of experience prototypes\n\n00:03:14.958 --> 00:03:18.958\nthat show just what we mean about the man-machine relationship.\n\n00:03:18.958 --> 00:03:20.958\nAnd it's a much better way to see.\n\n00:03:20.958 --> 00:03:23.958\nIt's kind of like architects who show people in their houses,\n\n00:03:23.958 --> 00:03:25.958\nas opposed to them being empty.\n\n00:03:25.958 --> 00:03:29.958\nSo I thought that I would show you a few videos\n\n00:03:29.958 --> 00:03:36.958\nto show off this new, broader definition\n\n00:03:36.958 --> 00:03:40.958\nof design in products and services and environments.\n\n00:03:40.958 --> 00:03:43.958\nI have a few of them -- they're no more than a minute\n\n00:03:43.958 --> 00:03:45.958\nor a minute-and-a-half apiece --\n\n00:03:45.958 --> 00:03:48.958\nbut I thought you might be interested in seeing some of our\n\n00:03:48.958 --> 00:03:53.958\nwork over the last year, and how it responds in video.\n\n00:03:53.958 --> 00:03:56.958\nSo, Prada New York: we were asked by Rem Koolhaas\n\n00:03:56.958 --> 00:04:00.958\nand OMA to help us conceive the technology\n\n00:04:00.958 --> 00:04:03.958\nthat's in their retail store in New York.\n\n00:04:03.958 --> 00:04:05.958\nHe wanted a new kind of store -- a new one --\n\n00:04:05.958 --> 00:04:10.958\na store that had a cultural role as well as a retail one.\n\n00:04:10.958 --> 00:04:14.958\nAnd that meant actually designing custom technology\n\n00:04:14.958 --> 00:04:19.958\nas opposed to just buying things off the shelf and putting them to use.\n\n00:04:19.958 --> 00:04:21.958\nSo, there're lots of things. Everything has RF tags:\n\n00:04:21.958 --> 00:04:24.958\nthere's RF tags on the user, on the cards,\n\n00:04:24.958 --> 00:04:27.958\nthere's the staff devices that are all around the store.\n\n00:04:27.958 --> 00:04:30.958\nYou pick them up, and once you see something that you're interested in,\n\n00:04:30.958 --> 00:04:32.958\nthe staff person can scan them in\n\n00:04:32.958 --> 00:04:35.958\nand then they can be shown on any screen throughout the store.\n\n00:04:35.958 --> 00:04:41.958\nYou can look at color, and sizes, and how it appeared on the runway, or whatever.\n\n00:04:41.958 --> 00:04:45.958\nAnd so then the object -- the merchandise that you're interested in --\n\n00:04:45.958 --> 00:04:48.958\ncan be scanned. It's taken into the dressing room,\n\n00:04:48.958 --> 00:04:50.958\nand in the dressing room there are scanners\n\n00:04:50.958 --> 00:04:55.958\nso that we know exactly what clothing you have in the dressing room.\n\n00:04:55.958 --> 00:04:58.958\nWe can put that up on a touch screen\n\n00:04:58.958 --> 00:05:00.958\nand you can play with that, and get more information\n\n00:05:00.958 --> 00:05:05.958\nabout the clothing that you're interested in as you're trying it on.\n\n00:05:05.958 --> 00:05:09.958\nIt's been used a lot of places, but I particularly like the use here\n\n00:05:09.958 --> 00:05:13.958\nof liquid crystal displays in the changing room.\n\n00:05:13.958 --> 00:05:15.958\nThe last time I went to see this store,\n\n00:05:15.958 --> 00:05:18.958\nthere was a huge buzz about people standing outside and wondering,\n\n00:05:18.958 --> 00:05:21.958\n\"Am I going to actually get to see the people changing clothes here?\"\n\n00:05:21.958 --> 00:05:26.958\nBut if you push the button, of course, the whole wall goes dark.\n\n00:05:26.958 --> 00:05:34.958\nSo you can try to get approval, or not, for whatever you're wearing.\n\n00:05:34.958 --> 00:05:37.958\nAnd then one of my favorite features of the technology\n\n00:05:37.958 --> 00:05:39.958\nis the magic mirror, where you put on the clothes.\n\n00:05:39.958 --> 00:05:43.958\nThere's a big display in the mirror, and you can turn around --\n\n00:05:43.958 --> 00:05:45.958\nbut there's a three second delay.\n\n00:05:45.958 --> 00:05:49.958\nSo you can see what you look like from the back or all the way around, as you look.\n\n00:05:49.958 --> 00:05:54.958\n(Applause)\n\n00:06:12.958 --> 00:06:16.958\nAbout a year and a half ago we were asked to design\n\n00:06:16.958 --> 00:06:18.958\nan installation in the museum --\n\n00:06:18.958 --> 00:06:21.958\nthis is a new wing of the Science Museum in London,\n\n00:06:21.958 --> 00:06:25.958\nand it's primarily about digital and biomedical issues.\n\n00:06:25.958 --> 00:06:29.958\nAnd a group at Itch, which is now part of IDEO,\n\n00:06:29.958 --> 00:06:32.958\ndesigned this interactive wall that's about four stories tall.\n\n00:06:32.958 --> 00:06:33.958\nI don't know if anybody's seen this --\n\n00:06:33.958 --> 00:06:35.958\nit's pretty spectacular in the room.\n\n00:06:35.958 --> 00:06:37.958\nAnyway, it's based on the London subway system.\n\n00:06:37.958 --> 00:06:40.958\nAnd so you can see that\n\n00:06:40.958 --> 00:06:42.958\nthe goal is to bring some of the feedback\n\n00:06:42.958 --> 00:06:45.958\nthat the people who had gone to the museum were giving,\n\n00:06:45.958 --> 00:06:48.958\nand get it up on the wall so everybody could see. Just for everybody to see.\n\n00:06:48.958 --> 00:06:52.958\nSo you enter your information. Then, like the London tube system,\n\n00:06:52.958 --> 00:06:57.958\nthe little trains go around with what you're thinking about.\n\n00:06:57.958 --> 00:07:02.958\nAnd then when you get to a station, it's expanded so that you can actually read it.\n\n00:07:02.958 --> 00:07:06.958\nThen when you exit the IMAX theatre on the fourth floor --\n\n00:07:06.958 --> 00:07:08.958\nmostly teenagers coming out of there --\n\n00:07:08.958 --> 00:07:12.958\nthere's this big open space that has these tables in it\n\n00:07:12.958 --> 00:07:14.958\nthat have interactive games which are quite fun,\n\n00:07:14.958 --> 00:07:16.958\nalso designed by Durrell [Bishop] and Andrew [Hirniak] of Itch.\n\n00:07:16.958 --> 00:07:22.958\nAnd the topics include things that the museum is about:\n\n00:07:22.958 --> 00:07:25.958\nmale fertility, choosing the sex of your baby\n\n00:07:25.958 --> 00:07:29.958\nor what a driverless car might be like.\n\n00:07:29.958 --> 00:07:31.958\nThere's lots of room, so people can come up\n\n00:07:31.958 --> 00:07:35.958\nand understand what it is before they get involved.\n\n00:07:35.958 --> 00:07:37.958\nAnd also, it's not shown in the video, but these are very beautiful.\n\n00:07:37.958 --> 00:07:41.958\nThey go to the top of the wall and when they reach all the way to the top,\n\n00:07:41.958 --> 00:07:44.958\nafter they've bounced around, they disperse into bits\n\n00:07:44.958 --> 00:07:46.958\nand go off into the atmosphere.\n\n00:07:50.958 --> 00:07:52.958\nThe next video is not done by us.\n\n00:07:52.958 --> 00:07:56.958\nThis is CBS Sunday Morning that aired about two weeks ago.\n\n00:07:56.958 --> 00:07:58.958\nScott Adams ran into us\n\n00:07:58.958 --> 00:08:00.958\nand asked us if we wouldn't help to design\n\n00:08:00.958 --> 00:08:02.958\nthe ultimate cubicle for Dilbert,\n\n00:08:02.958 --> 00:08:06.958\nwhich sounded like a fun thing and so we couldn't pass it up.\n\n00:08:06.958 --> 00:08:09.958\nHe's always been interested in technology in the future.\n\n00:08:09.958 --> 00:08:11.958\n(Video: Scott Adams: I realized that at some point I might be\n\n00:08:11.958 --> 00:08:14.958\nthe world's expert on what's wrong with cubicles.\n\n00:08:14.958 --> 00:08:16.958\nSo we thought, well, wouldn't it be fun to get together\n\n00:08:16.958 --> 00:08:18.958\nwith some of the smartest design guys in the world\n\n00:08:18.958 --> 00:08:21.958\nand try to figure out if we could make the cubicle better?\n\n00:08:21.958 --> 00:08:24.958\nNarrator: Though they work in a wide-open office space\n\n00:08:24.958 --> 00:08:29.958\nspectacularly set under San Francisco's Oakland Bay Bridge,\n\n00:08:29.958 --> 00:08:31.958\nthe team built their own little cubicles\n\n00:08:31.958 --> 00:08:34.958\nto fully experience the problems.\n\n00:08:34.958 --> 00:08:37.958\nWoman: A one-way mirror. I can look out; you can look at yourself.\n\n00:08:37.958 --> 00:08:38.958\nNarrator: They took pictures.\n\n00:08:38.958 --> 00:08:41.958\nWoman: You feel so trapped, when someone kind of leans over\n\n00:08:41.958 --> 00:08:43.958\nand you're sort of held captive there for a minute.\n\n00:08:43.958 --> 00:08:47.958\nSA: So far it's chaos, but a lot of people are doing stuff, so that's good.\n\n00:08:47.958 --> 00:08:49.958\nWe'll see what happens.\n\n00:08:49.958 --> 00:08:53.958\nNarrator: The first group builds a cubicle in which the walls are screens\n\n00:08:53.958 --> 00:08:56.958\nfor the computer and for family photos.\n\n00:08:56.958 --> 00:09:00.958\nIn the second group's scenario, the walls are alive\n\n00:09:00.958 --> 00:09:03.958\nand actually give Dilbert a group hug.\n\n00:09:03.958 --> 00:09:05.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:09:05.958 --> 00:09:11.958\nBehind the humor is the idea of making the cubicle more human.)\n\n00:09:11.958 --> 00:09:14.958\nDavid Kelley: So here's the final thing, complete with orange lighting\n\n00:09:14.958 --> 00:09:18.958\nthat follows the sun across -- that follows the tracks of the sun -- across the sky.\n\n00:09:18.958 --> 00:09:22.958\nSo you feel that in your cubicle.\n\n00:09:22.958 --> 00:09:24.958\nAnd my favorite feature, which is a flower in a vase\n\n00:09:24.958 --> 00:09:27.958\nthat wilts when you leave in disappointment,\n\n00:09:27.958 --> 00:09:31.958\nand then when you come back, it comes up to greet you, happy to see you.\n\n00:09:31.958 --> 00:09:33.958\n(SA: The storage is built right into the wall.)\n\n00:09:33.958 --> 00:09:38.958\nDK: You know, it has homey touches like a built-in fish tank in the walls,\n\n00:09:38.958 --> 00:09:42.958\nor something to be aggressive with to release tension.\n\n00:09:42.958 --> 00:09:45.958\n(SA: Customizable for the boss of your choice.)\n\n00:09:45.958 --> 00:09:48.958\nDK: And of course: a hammock for your afternoon nap\n\n00:09:48.958 --> 00:09:50.958\nthat stretches across your cubicle.\n\n00:09:50.958 --> 00:09:54.958\n(SA: Life would be sweet in a cubicle like this.)\n\n00:09:56.958 --> 00:10:01.958\nDK: This next project, we were asked to design a pavilion to celebrate\n\n00:10:01.958 --> 00:10:05.958\nthe recycling of the water on the Millennium Dome in London.\n\n00:10:05.958 --> 00:10:08.958\nThe dome has an incredible amount of water that washes off of it,\n\n00:10:08.958 --> 00:10:10.958\nas well as wastewater.\n\n00:10:10.958 --> 00:10:13.958\nSo this building actually celebrates the water\n\n00:10:13.958 --> 00:10:16.958\nas it comes out of the recycling plant and goes into the reed bed\n\n00:10:16.958 --> 00:10:19.958\nso that it can be filtered for the final time.\n\n00:10:21.958 --> 00:10:25.958\nThe pavilion's design goal was to be kind of quiet and peaceful.\n\n00:10:25.958 --> 00:10:28.958\nIn contrast to if you went inside the dome, where it's\n\n00:10:28.958 --> 00:10:30.958\nkind of wild and crazy and everybody's\n\n00:10:30.958 --> 00:10:33.958\nlearning all kinds of things, or fooling around, or whatever they're doing.\n\n00:10:33.958 --> 00:10:36.958\nBut it was intended to be quite quiet.\n\n00:10:36.958 --> 00:10:40.958\nAnd then you would wander around and gather information,\n\n00:10:40.958 --> 00:10:44.958\nin a straightforward fashion, about the recycling process\n\n00:10:44.958 --> 00:10:47.958\nand what's being done, and how they're going to reuse the water\n\n00:10:47.958 --> 00:10:49.958\nonce it comes through the plant.\n\n00:10:58.958 --> 00:11:00.958\nAnd then, if you saw,\n\n00:11:00.958 --> 00:11:03.958\nthe panels actually rotate. So you can get the information\n\n00:11:03.958 --> 00:11:06.958\non the front side, but as they rotate, you can see the actual\n\n00:11:06.958 --> 00:11:10.958\nrecycling plant behind, with all the machines as they actually process the water.\n\n00:11:16.958 --> 00:11:18.958\nYou can see: there's the plant.\n\n00:11:27.958 --> 00:11:31.958\nThese are all very low-budget videos, like quick prototypes.\n\n00:11:31.958 --> 00:11:33.958\nAnd we're announcing a new product here tonight,\n\n00:11:33.958 --> 00:11:36.958\nwhich is the first time this has ever been shown in public.\n\n00:11:36.958 --> 00:11:41.958\nIt's called Spyfish, and it's a company called H2Eye,\n\n00:11:41.958 --> 00:11:44.958\nstarted by Nigel Jagger in London.\n\n00:11:44.958 --> 00:11:50.958\nAnd it's a company that's trying to bring the experience -- many people have boats,\n\n00:11:50.958 --> 00:11:55.958\nor enjoy being on boats, but a very small percentage of people\n\n00:11:55.958 --> 00:12:00.958\nactually have the capability or the interest in going under the water\n\n00:12:00.958 --> 00:12:02.958\nand actually seeing what's there,\n\n00:12:02.958 --> 00:12:04.958\nand enjoying what scuba divers do.\n\n00:12:04.958 --> 00:12:06.958\nThis product, it has two cameras.\n\n00:12:06.958 --> 00:12:09.958\nYou throw it over the side of your boat\n\n00:12:09.958 --> 00:12:12.958\nand you basically scuba dive without getting wet.\n\n00:12:16.958 --> 00:12:22.958\nFor us -- there's the object -- for us, it was two projects. One, to design the interface\n\n00:12:22.958 --> 00:12:24.958\nso that the interface doesn't get in your way.\n\n00:12:24.958 --> 00:12:27.958\nYou could have that kind of immersive experience of being underwater --\n\n00:12:27.958 --> 00:12:30.958\nof feeling like you're underwater -- seeing what's going on.\n\n00:12:30.958 --> 00:12:32.958\nAnd the other one was to design the object\n\n00:12:32.958 --> 00:12:37.958\nand make sure that it was a consumer product and not a research tool.\n\n00:12:37.958 --> 00:12:39.958\nAnd so we spent a lot of time -- this has been going on for about\n\n00:12:39.958 --> 00:12:41.958\nseven or eight years, this project --\n\n00:12:41.958 --> 00:12:44.958\nand [we're] just ready to start building them.\n\n00:12:47.958 --> 00:12:51.958\n(Narrator: The Spyfish is a revolutionary subaquatic video camera.\n\n00:12:51.958 --> 00:12:54.958\nIt can dive to 500 feet, to where sunlight does not penetrate,\n\n00:12:54.958 --> 00:12:57.958\nand is equipped with powerful lights.\n\n00:12:57.958 --> 00:13:02.958\nIt becomes your eyes and ears as you venture into the deep.\n\n00:13:02.958 --> 00:13:06.958\nThe battery-powered Spyfish sends the live video-feed through a slender cable.)\n\n00:13:06.958 --> 00:13:09.958\nDK: This slender cable was a huge technological advancement\n\n00:13:09.958 --> 00:13:11.958\nand it allowed the whole thing to be the size that it is.\n\n00:13:11.958 --> 00:13:14.958\n(Narrator: And this central box connects the whole system together.\n\n00:13:14.958 --> 00:13:18.958\nManeuvering the Spyfish is simple with the wireless remote control.\n\n00:13:18.958 --> 00:13:20.958\nYou watch the video with superimposed graphics\n\n00:13:20.958 --> 00:13:24.958\nthat indicate your depth and compass heading.\n\n00:13:24.958 --> 00:13:26.958\nThe fluid graphics and ambient sounds combine\n\n00:13:26.958 --> 00:13:29.958\nto help you completely lose yourself underwater.)\n\n00:13:50.958 --> 00:13:56.958\n(Applause)\n\n00:13:56.958 --> 00:13:59.958\nDK: And the last thing I'll talk about is ApproTEC,\n\n00:13:59.958 --> 00:14:02.958\nwhich is a project that I'm very excited about.\n\n00:14:02.958 --> 00:14:05.958\nApproTEC is a company started by Dr. Martin Fisher,\n\n00:14:05.958 --> 00:14:08.958\nwho's a good friend of mine. He's a Ph.D. from Stanford.\n\n00:14:08.958 --> 00:14:11.958\nHe found himself in Kenya on a Fulbright\n\n00:14:11.958 --> 00:14:13.958\nand he had a very interesting insight, which is that\n\n00:14:13.958 --> 00:14:17.958\nhe said, \"There must be entrepreneurs in Kenya;\n\n00:14:17.958 --> 00:14:19.958\nthere must be entrepreneurs everywhere.\"\n\n00:14:19.958 --> 00:14:22.958\nAnd he noticed that for weddings and funerals there\n\n00:14:22.958 --> 00:14:25.958\nthey could find enough money to put something together.\n\n00:14:25.958 --> 00:14:29.958\nSo he decided to start manufacturing products in Kenya\n\n00:14:29.958 --> 00:14:34.958\nwith Kenyan manufacturers -- designed by people like us, but taken there.\n\n00:14:34.958 --> 00:14:37.958\nAnd to this date -- he's been gone for only a few years --\n\n00:14:37.958 --> 00:14:41.958\nhe's started 19,000 companies.\n\n00:14:41.958 --> 00:14:44.958\nHe's made 30,000 new jobs.\n\n00:14:44.958 --> 00:14:49.958\nAnd just the sales of the products -- this is a non-profit --\n\n00:14:49.958 --> 00:14:55.958\nthe sales of these products is now .6% of the GDP of Kenya.\n\n00:14:55.958 --> 00:14:58.958\nThis is one guy doing this. This is a pretty spectacular thing.\n\n00:14:58.958 --> 00:15:01.958\nSo we're in the process of helping them design\n\n00:15:01.958 --> 00:15:04.958\ndeep-well, low-cost manual pumps\n\n00:15:04.958 --> 00:15:08.958\nin order for these people who have a quarter acre of land\n\n00:15:08.958 --> 00:15:10.958\nto be able to grow crops in the off-season.\n\n00:15:10.958 --> 00:15:12.958\nWhat they do now is: they can grow crops in the rainy season\n\n00:15:12.958 --> 00:15:15.958\nbut they can't grow them in the off-season.\n\n00:15:15.958 --> 00:15:19.958\nAnd so by doing that, the woman that you saw in the first thing --\n\n00:15:19.958 --> 00:15:23.958\nshe's a school teacher -- always wanted to send her kids to college\n\n00:15:23.958 --> 00:15:25.958\nand she's going to be able to do it because of these things.\n\n00:15:25.958 --> 00:15:28.958\nSo with seed-squeezers, and pumps, and hay-balers and\n\n00:15:28.958 --> 00:15:31.958\nvery straightforward things that we're designing --\n\n00:15:31.958 --> 00:15:33.958\nmy students are doing this as class projects\n\n00:15:33.958 --> 00:15:36.958\nand IDEO has donated their time to do this kind of work --\n\n00:15:36.958 --> 00:15:40.958\nit's really amazing to see his success, Martin's.\n\n00:15:40.958 --> 00:15:45.958\nWe also were thinking about the experience of Richard,\n\n00:15:45.958 --> 00:15:46.958\nand so --\n\n00:15:46.958 --> 00:15:47.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:15:47.958 --> 00:15:52.958\n-- we designed this hat, because I knew I'd be the last one in the day\n\n00:15:52.958 --> 00:15:56.958\nand I needed to deal with him. So I just have one more thing to say.\n\n00:15:56.958 --> 00:15:59.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:15:59.958 --> 00:16:01.958\nCan you read it?\n\n00:16:01.958 --> 00:16:02.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:16:02.958 --> 00:16:05.958\nWell, it's always kind of funny when he comes up and hovers.\n\n00:16:05.958 --> 00:16:09.958\nYou know, you don't want to be rude to him and you don't want to feel guilty,\n\n00:16:09.958 --> 00:16:12.958\nand so I thought this would do it, where I just sit here.\n\n00:16:12.958 --> 00:16:13.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:16:13.958 --> 00:16:21.958\n(Applause)\n\n00:16:21.958 --> 00:16:25.958\nSo we saw a lot of interesting things being designed today in this session,\n\n00:16:25.958 --> 00:16:28.958\nand from all the different presenters.\n\n00:16:28.958 --> 00:16:32.958\nAnd in my own practice, from product to ApproTEC,\n\n00:16:32.958 --> 00:16:37.958\nit's really exciting that we're taking a more human-centered approach to design,\n\n00:16:37.958 --> 00:16:40.958\nthat we're including behaviors and personalities in the things we do,\n\n00:16:40.958 --> 00:16:42.958\nand I think this is great.\n\n00:16:42.958 --> 00:16:44.958\nDesigners are more trusted and more integrated\n\n00:16:44.958 --> 00:16:46.958\ninto the business strategy of companies,\n\n00:16:46.958 --> 00:16:52.958\nand I have to say, for one, I feel very lucky at the progress that design\n\n00:16:52.958 --> 00:16:54.958\nhas made since the first TED.

And here's the unromantic truth \u2014 and the city air makes you free, they said in Renaissance Germany. So some people go to places like Shanghai but most go to the squatter cities where aesthetics rule. And these are not really a people oppressed by poverty. They're people getting out of poverty as fast as they can. They're the dominant builders and to a large extent, the dominant designers. They have home-brewed infrastructure and vibrant urban life.One-sixth of the GDP in India is coming out of Mumbai. They are constantly upgrading, and in a few cases, the government helps. Education is the main event that can happen in cities. What's going on in the street in Mumbai? Al Gore knows. It's basically everything. There's no unemployment in squatter cities. Everyone works. One-sixth of humanity is there. It's soon going to be more than that.So here's the first punch line: cities have defused the population bomb.And here's the second punch line.

Well, villages of the world are emptying out.\n\n00:00:51.958 --> 00:00:53.958\nThe question is, why?\n\n00:00:53.958 --> 00:00:58.958\nAnd here's the unromantic truth -- and the city air makes you free,\n\n00:00:58.958 --> 00:01:01.958\nthey said in Renaissance Germany. So some people go to places\n\n00:01:01.958 --> 00:01:07.958\nlike Shanghai but most go to the squatter cities where aesthetics rule.\n\n00:01:07.958 --> 00:01:09.958\nAnd these are not really a people oppressed by poverty.\n\n00:01:09.958 --> 00:01:12.958\nThey're people getting out of poverty as fast as they can.\n\n00:01:12.958 --> 00:01:16.958\nThey're the dominant builders and to a large extent, the dominant designers.\n\n00:01:16.958 --> 00:01:18.958\nThey have home-brewed infrastructure and vibrant urban life.\n\n00:01:18.958 --> 00:01:23.958\nOne-sixth of the GDP in India is coming out of Mumbai.\n\n00:01:23.958 --> 00:01:27.958\nThey are constantly upgrading, and in a few cases, the government helps.\n\n00:01:27.958 --> 00:01:30.958\nEducation is the main event that can happen in cities.\n\n00:01:30.958 --> 00:01:32.958\nWhat's going on in the street in Mumbai?\n\n00:01:32.958 --> 00:01:39.958\nAl Gore knows. It's basically everything.\n\n00:01:39.958 --> 00:01:42.958\nThere's no unemployment in squatter cities. Everyone works.\n\n00:01:52.958 --> 00:01:56.958\nOne-sixth of humanity is there. It's soon going to be more than that.\n\n00:01:56.958 --> 00:01:59.958\nSo here's the first punch line:\n\n00:01:59.958 --> 00:02:05.958\ncities have defused the population bomb.\n\n00:02:05.958 --> 00:02:10.958\nAnd here's the second punch line.\n\n00:02:10.958 --> 00:02:13.958\nThat's the news from downtown. Here it is in perspective.\n\n00:02:44.958 --> 00:02:47.958\nStars have shined down on earth's life for billions of years.\n\n00:02:47.958 --> 00:02:49.958\nNow we're shining right back up.\n\n00:02:57.958 --> 00:02:59.958\nThank you."}, {"title": "How brain science will change computing", "duration": "1211", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/jeff_hawkins_on_how_brain_science_will_change_computing", "transcript": "I do two things: I design mobile computers and I study brains. Today's talk is about brains and \u2014 (Audience member cheers) Yay! I have a brain fan out there.(Laughter) If I could have my first slide, you'll see the title of my talk and my two affiliations. So what I'm going to talk about is why we don't have a good brain theory, why it is important that we should develop one and what we can do about it. I'll try to do all that in 20 minutes. I have two affiliations. Most of you know me from my Palm and Handspring days, but I also run a nonprofit scientific research institute called the Redwood Neuroscience Institute in Menlo Park. We study theoretical neuroscience and how the neocortex works. I'm going to talk all about that.I have one slide on my other life, the computer life, and that's this slide here. These are some of the products I've worked on over the last 20 years, starting from the very original laptop to some of the first tablet computers and so on, ending up most recently with the Treo, and we're continuing to do this. I've done this because I believe mobile computing is the future of personal computing, and I'm trying to make the world a little bit better by working on these things. But this was, I admit, all an accident. I really didn't want to do any of these products. Very early in my career I decided I was not going to be in the computer industry.Before that, I just have to tell you about this picture of Graffiti I picked off the web the other day. I was looking for a picture for Graffiti that'll text input language. I found a website dedicated to teachers who want to make script-writing things across the top of their blackboard, and they had added Graffiti to it, and I'm sorry about that.(Laughter)So what happened was, when I was young and got out of engineering school at Cornell in '79, I went to work for Intel and was in the computer industry, and three months into that, I fell in love with something else. I said, \"I made the wrong career choice here,\" and I fell in love with brains. This is not a real brain. This is a picture of one, a line drawing. And I don't remember exactly how it happened, but I have one recollection, which was pretty strong in my mind. In September of 1979, Scientific American came out with a single-topic issue about the brain. It was one of their best issues ever. They talked about the neuron, development, disease, vision and all the things you might want to know about brains. It was really quite impressive.One might've had the impression we knew a lot about brains. But the last article in that issue was written by Francis Crick of DNA fame. Today is, I think, the 50th anniversary of the discovery of DNA. And he wrote a story basically saying, this is all well and good, but you know, we don't know diddly squat about brains, and no one has a clue how they work, so don't believe what anyone tells you. This is a quote from that article, he says: \"What is conspicuously lacking\" \u2014 he's a very proper British gentleman \u2014 \"What is conspicuously lacking is a broad framework of ideas in which to interpret these different approaches.\" I thought the word \"framework\" was great. He didn't say we didn't have a theory. He says we don't even know how to begin to think about it. We don't even have a framework. We are in the pre-paradigm days, if you want to use Thomas Kuhn. So I fell in love with this. I said, look: We have all this knowledge about brains \u2014 how hard can it be? It's something we can work on in my lifetime; I could make a difference. So I tried to get out of the computer business, into the brain business.First, I went to MIT, the AI lab was there. I said, I want to build intelligent machines too, but I want to study how brains work first. And they said, \"Oh, you don't need to do that. You're just going to program computers, that's all. I said, you really ought to study brains. They said, \"No, you're wrong.\" I said, \"No, you're wrong,\" and I didn't get in.(Laughter)I was a little disappointed \u2014 pretty young \u2014 but I went back again a few years later, this time in California, and I went to Berkeley. And I said, I'll go in from the biological side. So I got in the PhD program in biophysics. I was like, I'm studying brains now. Well, I want to study theory. They said, \"You can't study theory about brains. You can't get funded for that. And as a graduate student, you can't do that.\" So I said, oh my gosh. I was depressed; I said, but I can make a difference in this field. I went back in the computer industry and said, I'll have to work here for a while. That's when I designed all those computer products.(Laughter)I said, I want to do this for four years, make some money, I was having a family, and I would mature a bit, and maybe the business of neuroscience would mature a bit. Well, it took longer than four years. It's been about 16 years. But I'm doing it now, and I'm going to tell you about it. So why should we have a good brain theory? Well, there's lots of reasons people do science. The most basic one is, people like to know things. We're curious, and we go out and get knowledge. Why do we study ants? It's interesting. Maybe we'll learn something useful, but it's interesting and fascinating. But sometimes a science has other attributes which makes it really interesting.Sometimes a science will tell something about ourselves; it'll tell us who we are. Evolution did this and Copernicus did this, where we have a new understanding of who we are. And after all, we are our brains. My brain is talking to your brain. Our bodies are hanging along for the ride, but my brain is talking to your brain. And if we want to understand who we are and how we feel and perceive, we need to understand brains. Another thing is sometimes science leads to big societal benefits, technologies, or businesses or whatever. This is one, too, because when we understand how brains work, we'll be able to build intelligent machines. That's a good thing on the whole, with tremendous benefits to society, just like a fundamental technology.So why don't we have a good theory of brains? People have been working on it for 100 years. Let's first take a look at what normal science looks like. This is normal science. Normal science is a nice balance between theory and experimentalists. The theorist guy says, \"I think this is what's going on,\" the experimentalist says, \"You're wrong.\" It goes back and forth, this works in physics, this in geology. But if this is normal science, what does neuroscience look like? This is what neuroscience looks like. We have this mountain of data, which is anatomy, physiology and behavior. You can't imagine how much detail we know about brains. There were 28,000 people who went to the neuroscience conference this year, and every one of them is doing research in brains. A lot of data, but no theory. There's a little wimpy box on top there.And theory has not played a role in any sort of grand way in the neurosciences. And it's a real shame. Now, why has this come about? If you ask neuroscientists why is this the state of affairs, first, they'll admit it. But if you ask them, they say, there's various reasons we don't have a good brain theory. Some say we still don't have enough data, we need more information, there's all these things we don't know. Well, I just told you there's data coming out of your ears. We have so much information, we don't even know how to organize it. What good is more going to do? Maybe we'll be lucky and discover some magic thing, but I don't think so. This is a symptom of the fact that we just don't have a theory. We don't need more data, we need a good theory.Another one is sometimes people say, \"Brains are so complex, it'll take another 50 years.\" I even think Chris said something like this yesterday, something like, it's one of the most complicated things in the universe. That's not true \u2014 you're more complicated than your brain. You've got a brain. And although the brain looks very complicated, things look complicated until you understand them. That's always been the case. So we can say, my neocortex, the part of the brain I'm interested in, has 30 billion cells. But, you know what? It's very, very regular. In fact, it looks like it's the same thing repeated over and over again. It's not as complex as it looks. That's not the issue.Some people say, brains can't understand brains. Very Zen-like. Woo.(Laughter)You know, it sounds good, but why? I mean, what's the point? It's just a bunch of cells. You understand your liver. It's got a lot of cells in it too, right? So, you know, I don't think there's anything to that. And finally, some people say, \"I don't feel like a bunch of cells \u2014 I'm conscious. I've got this experience, I'm in the world. I can't be just a bunch of cells.\" Well, people used to believe there was a life force to be living, and we now know that's really not true at all. And there's really no evidence, other than that people just disbelieve that cells can do what they do. So some people have fallen into the pit of metaphysical dualism, some really smart people, too, but we can reject all that.(Laughter)No, there's something else, something really fundamental, and it is: another reason why we don't have a good brain theory is because we have an intuitive, strongly held but incorrect assumption that has prevented us from seeing the answer. There's something we believe that just, it's obvious, but it's wrong. Now, there's a history of this in science and before I tell you what it is, I'll tell you about the history of it in science. Look at other scientific revolutions \u2014 the solar system, that's Copernicus, Darwin's evolution, and tectonic plates, that's Wegener. They all have a lot in common with brain science.First, they had a lot of unexplained data. A lot of it. But it got more manageable once they had a theory. The best minds were stumped \u2014 really smart people. We're not smarter now than they were then; it just turns out it's really hard to think of things, but once you've thought of them, it's easy to understand. My daughters understood these three theories, in their basic framework, in kindergarten. It's not that hard \u2014 here's the apple, here's the orange, the Earth goes around, that kind of stuff.Another thing is the answer was there all along, but we kind of ignored it because of this obvious thing. It was an intuitive, strongly held belief that was wrong. In the case of the solar system, the idea that the Earth is spinning, the surface is going a thousand miles an hour, and it's going through the solar system at a million miles an hour \u2014 this is lunacy; we all know the Earth isn't moving. Do you feel like you're moving a thousand miles an hour? If you said Earth was spinning around in space and was huge \u2014 they would lock you up, that's what they did back then. So it was intuitive and obvious. Now, what about evolution?Evolution, same thing. We taught our kids the Bible says God created all these species, cats are cats; dogs are dogs; people are people; plants are plants; they don't change. Noah put them on the ark in that order, blah, blah. The fact is, if you believe in evolution, we all have a common ancestor. We all have a common ancestor with the plant in the lobby! This is what evolution tells us. And it's true. It's kind of unbelievable. And the same thing about tectonic plates. All the mountains and the continents are kind of floating around on top of the Earth. It doesn't make any sense.So what is the intuitive, but incorrect assumption, that's kept us from understanding brains? I'll tell you. It'll seem obvious that it's correct. That's the point. Then I'll make an argument why you're incorrect on the other assumption. The intuitive but obvious thing is: somehow, intelligence is defined by behavior; we're intelligent because of how we do things and how we behave intelligently. And I'm going to tell you that's wrong. Intelligence is defined by prediction.I'm going to work you through this in a few slides, and give you an example of what this means. Here's a system. Engineers and scientists like to look at systems like this. They say, we have a thing in a box. We have its inputs and outputs. The AI people said, the thing in the box is a programmable computer, because it's equivalent to a brain. We'll feed it some inputs and get it to do something, have some behavior. Alan Turing defined the Turing test, which essentially says, we'll know if something's intelligent if it behaves identical to a human \u2014 a behavioral metric of what intelligence is that has stuck in our minds for a long time.Reality, though \u2014 I call it real intelligence. Real intelligence is built on something else. We experience the world through a sequence of patterns, and we store them, and we recall them. When we recall them, we match them up against reality, and we're making predictions all the time. It's an internal metric; there's an internal metric about us, saying, do we understand the world, am I making predictions, and so on. You're all being intelligent now, but you're not doing anything. Maybe you're scratching yourself, but you're not doing anything. But you're being intelligent; you're understanding what I'm saying. Because you're intelligent and you speak English, you know the word at the end of this sentence.The word came to you; you make these predictions all the time. What I'm saying is, the internal prediction is the output in the neocortex, and somehow, prediction leads to intelligent behavior. Here's how that happens: Let's start with a non-intelligent brain. I'll argue a non-intelligent brain, we'll call it an old brain. And we'll say it's a non-mammal, like a reptile, say, an alligator; we have an alligator. And the alligator has some very sophisticated senses. It's got good eyes and ears and touch senses and so on, a mouth and a nose. It has very complex behavior. It can run and hide. It has fears and emotions. It can eat you. It can attack. It can do all kinds of stuff. But we don't consider the alligator very intelligent, not in a human sort of way.But it has all this complex behavior already. Now in evolution, what happened? First thing that happened in evolution with mammals is we started to develop a thing called the neocortex. I'm going to represent the neocortex by this box on top of the old brain. Neocortex means \"new layer.\" It's a new layer on top of your brain. It's the wrinkly thing on the top of your head that got wrinkly because it got shoved in there and doesn't fit.(Laughter)Literally, it's about the size of a table napkin and doesn't fit, so it's wrinkly. Now, look at how I've drawn this. The old brain is still there. You still have that alligator brain. You do. It's your emotional brain. It's all those gut reactions you have. On top of it, we have this memory system called the neocortex. And the memory system is sitting over the sensory part of the brain. So as the sensory input comes in and feeds from the old brain, it also goes up into the neocortex. And the neocortex is just memorizing. It's sitting there saying, I'm going to memorize all the things going on: where I've been, people I've seen, things I've heard, and so on. And in the future, when it sees something similar to that again, in a similar environment, or the exact same environment, it'll start playing it back: \"Oh, I've been here before,\" and when you were here before, this happened next. It allows you to predict the future. It literally feeds back the signals into your brain; they'll let you see what's going to happen next, will let you hear the word \"sentence\" before I said it. And it's this feeding back into the old brain that will allow you to make more intelligent decisions.This is the most important slide of my talk, so I'll dwell on it a little. And all the time you say, \"Oh, I can predict things,\" so if you're a rat and you go through a maze, and you learn the maze, next time you're in one, you have the same behavior. But suddenly, you're smarter; you say, \"I recognize this maze, I know which way to go; I've been here before; I can envision the future.\" That's what it's doing. This is true for all mammals \u2014 in humans, it got a lot worse. Humans actually developed the front of the neocortex, called the anterior part of the neocortex. And nature did a little trick. It copied the posterior, the back part, which is sensory, and put it in the front. Humans uniquely have the same mechanism on the front, but we use it for motor control.So we're now able to do very sophisticated motor planning, things like that. I don't have time to explain, but to understand how a brain works, you have to understand how the first part of the mammalian neocortex works, how it is we store patterns and make predictions. Let me give you a few examples of predictions. I already said the word \"sentence.\" In music, if you've heard a song before, when you hear it, the next note pops into your head already \u2014 you anticipate it. With an album, at the end of a song, the next song pops into your head. It happens all the time, you make predictions.I have this thing called the \"altered door\" thought experiment. It says, you have a door at home; when you're here, I'm changing it \u2014 I've got a guy back at your house right now, moving the door around, moving your doorknob over two inches. When you go home tonight, you'll put your hand out, reach for the doorknob, notice it's in the wrong spot and go, \"Whoa, something happened.\" It may take a second, but something happened. I can change your doorknob in other ways \u2014 make it larger, smaller, change its brass to silver, make it a lever, I can change the door; put colors on, put windows in. I can change a thousand things about your door and in the two seconds you take to open it, you'll notice something has changed.Now, the engineering approach, the AI approach to this, is to build a door database with all the door attributes. And as you go up to the door, we check them off one at time: door, door, color ... We don't do that. Your brain doesn't do that. Your brain is making constant predictions all the time about what will happen in your environment. As I put my hand on this table, I expect to feel it stop. When I walk, every step, if I missed it by an eighth of an inch, I'll know something has changed. You're constantly making predictions about your environment. I'll talk about vision, briefly. This is a picture of a woman. When we look at people, our eyes saccade over two to three times a second. We're not aware of it, but our eyes are always moving. When we look at a face, we typically go from eye to eye to nose to mouth. When your eye moves from eye to eye, if there was something else there like a nose, you'd see a nose where an eye is supposed to be and go, \"Oh, shit!\"(Laughter)\"There's something wrong about this person.\" That's because you're making a prediction. It's not like you just look over and say, \"What am I seeing? A nose? OK.\" No, you have an expectation of what you're going to see.Every single moment. And finally, let's think about how we test intelligence. We test it by prediction: What is the next word in this ...? This is to this as this is to this. What is the next number in this sentence? Here's three visions of an object. What's the fourth one? That's how we test it. It's all about prediction.So what is the recipe for brain theory? First of all, we have to have the right framework. And the framework is a memory framework, not a computational or behavior framework, it's a memory framework. How do you store and recall these sequences of patterns? It's spatiotemporal patterns.Then, if in that framework, you take a bunch of theoreticians \u2014 biologists generally are not good theoreticians. Not always, but generally, there's not a good history of theory in biology. I've found the best people to work with are physicists, engineers and mathematicians, who tend to think algorithmically. Then they have to learn the anatomy and the physiology. You have to make these theories very realistic in anatomical terms. Anyone who tells you their theory about how the brain works and doesn't tell you exactly how it's working and how the wiring works \u2014 it's not a theory.And that's what we do at the Redwood Neuroscience Institute. I'd love to tell you we're making fantastic progress in this thing, and I expect to be back on this stage sometime in the not too distant future, to tell you about it. I'm really excited; this is not going to take 50 years.What will brain theory look like? First of all, it's going to be about memory. Not like computer memory \u2014 not at all like computer memory. It's very different. It's a memory of very high-dimensional patterns, like the things that come from your eyes. It's also memory of sequences: you cannot learn or recall anything outside of a sequence. A song must be heard in sequence over time, and you must play it back in sequence over time. And these sequences are auto-associatively recalled, so if I see something, I hear something, it reminds me of it, and it plays back automatically. It's an automatic playback. And prediction of future inputs is the desired output. And as I said, the theory must be biologically accurate, it must be testable and you must be able to build it. If you don't build it, you don't understand it.One more slide. What is this going to result in? Are we going to really build intelligent machines? Absolutely. And it's going to be different than people think. No doubt that it's going to happen, in my mind. First of all, we're going to build this stuff out of silicon. The same techniques we use to build silicon computer memories, we can use here. But they're very different types of memories. And we'll attach these memories to sensors, and the sensors will experience real-live, real-world data, and learn about their environment.Now, it's very unlikely the first things you'll see are like robots. Not that robots aren't useful; people can build robots. But the robotics part is the hardest part. That's old brain. That's really hard. The new brain is easier than the old brain. So first we'll do things that don't require a lot of robotics. So you're not going to see C-3PO. You're going to see things more like intelligent cars that really understand what traffic is, what driving is and have learned that cars with the blinkers on for half a minute probably aren't going to turn.(Laughter)We can also do intelligent security systems. Anytime we're basically using our brain but not doing a lot of mechanics \u2014 those are the things that will happen first. But ultimately, the world's the limit. I don't know how this will turn out. I know a lot of people who invented the microprocessor. And if you talk to them, they knew what they were doing was really significant, but they didn't really know what was going to happen. They couldn't anticipate cell phones and the Internet and all this kind of stuff. They just knew like, \"We're going to build calculators and traffic-light controllers. But it's going to be big!\" In the same way, brain science and these memories are going to be a very fundamental technology, and it will lead to unbelievable changes in the next 100 years. And I'm most excited about how we're going to use them in science. So I think that's all my time \u2014 I'm over, and I'm going to end my talk right there.", "id": 125, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:12.434 --> 00:00:13.585\nI do two things:\n\n00:00:13.609 --> 00:00:15.727\nI design mobile computers\nand I study brains.\n\n00:00:15.751 --> 00:00:18.681\nToday's talk is about brains\nand -- (Audience member cheers)\n\n00:00:18.705 --> 00:00:20.522\nYay!

very original laptop\n\n00:01:00.697 --> 00:01:02.484\nto some of the first tablet computers\n\n00:01:02.508 --> 00:01:04.806\nand so on, ending up\nmost recently with the Treo,\n\n00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:06.362\nand we're continuing to do this.\n\n00:01:06.386 --> 00:01:08.687\nI've done this because\nI believe mobile computing\n\n00:01:08.711 --> 00:01:10.435\nis the future of personal computing,\n\n00:01:10.459 --> 00:01:12.913\nand I'm trying to make\nthe world a little bit better\n\n00:01:12.937 --> 00:01:14.233\nby working on these things.\n\n00:01:14.257 --> 00:01:16.131\nBut this was, I admit, all an accident.\n\n00:01:16.155 --> 00:01:18.463\nI really didn't want to do\nany of these products.\n\n00:01:18.487 --> 00:01:19.869\nVery early in my career\n\n00:01:19.893 --> 00:01:22.583\nI decided I was not going to be\nin the computer industry.\n\n00:01:22.607 --> 00:01:24.328\nBefore that, I just have to tell you\n\n00:01:24.352 --> 00:01:27.460\nabout this picture of Graffiti\nI picked off the web the other day.\n\n00:01:27.484 --> 00:01:30.737\nI was looking for a picture for Graffiti\nthat'll text input language.\n\n00:01:30.761 --> 00:01:34.450\nI found a website dedicated to teachers\nwho want to make script-writing things\n\n00:01:34.474 --> 00:01:36.148\nacross the top of their blackboard,\n\n00:01:36.172 --> 00:01:39.005\nand they had added Graffiti to it,\nand I'm sorry about that.\n\n00:01:39.029 --> 00:01:41.276\n(Laughter)\n\n00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:42.600\nSo what happened was,\n\n00:01:42.624 --> 00:01:47.523\nwhen I was young and got out\nof engineering school at Cornell in '79,\n\n00:01:47.547 --> 00:01:50.734\nI went to work for Intel\nand was in the computer industry,\n\n00:01:50.758 --> 00:01:54.160\nand three months into that,\nI fell in love with something else.\n\n00:01:54.184 --> 00:01:57.228\nI said, \"I made\nthe wrong career choice here,\"\n\n00:01:57.252 --> 00:01:59.491\nand I fell in love with brains.\n\n00:01:59.515 --> 00:02:01.048\nThis is not a real brain.\n\n00:02:01.072 --> 00:02:03.791\nThis is a picture of one, a line drawing.\n\n00:02:03.815 --> 00:02:05.934\nAnd I don't remember\nexactly how it happened,\n\n00:02:05.958 --> 00:02:09.473\nbut I have one recollection,\nwhich was pretty strong in my mind.\n\n00:02:09.497 --> 00:02:11.107\nIn September of 1979,\n\n00:02:11.131 --> 00:02:14.495\nScientific American came out\nwith a single-topic issue about the brain.\n\n00:02:14.519 --> 00:02:16.457\nIt was one of their best issues ever.\n\n00:02:16.481 --> 00:02:19.428\nThey talked about the neuron,\ndevelopment, disease, vision\n\n00:02:19.452 --> 00:02:22.048\nand all the things you might want\nto know about brains.\n\n00:02:22.072 --> 00:02:23.574\nIt was really quite impressive.\n\n00:02:23.598 --> 00:02:26.370\nOne might've had the impression\nwe knew a lot about brains.\n\n00:02:26.394 --> 00:02:30.589\nBut the last article in that issue\nwas written by Francis Crick of DNA fame.\n\n00:02:30.613 --> 00:02:33.637\nToday is, I think, the 50th anniversary\nof the discovery of DNA.\n\n00:02:33.661 --> 00:02:36.736\nAnd he wrote a story basically saying,\nthis is all well and good,\n\n00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:39.503\nbut you know, we don't know\ndiddly squat about brains,\n\n00:02:39.527 --> 00:02:41.266\nand no one has a clue how they work,\n\n00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:43.156\nso don't believe what anyone tells you.\n\n00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:45.345\nThis is a quote\nfrom that article, he says:\n\n00:02:45.369 --> 00:02:49.662\n\"What is conspicuously lacking\" --\nhe's a very proper British gentleman --\n\n00:02:49.686 --> 00:02:52.516\n\"What is conspicuously lacking\nis a broad framework of ideas\n\n00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:54.892\nin which to interpret\nthese different approaches.\"\n\n00:02:54.916 --> 00:02:56.884\nI thought the word \"framework\" was great.\n\n00:02:56.908 --> 00:02:58.725\nHe didn't say we didn't have a theory.\n\n00:02:58.749 --> 00:03:01.474\nHe says we don't even know\nhow to begin to think about it.\n\n00:03:01.498 --> 00:03:02.990\nWe don't even have a framework.\n\n00:03:03.014 --> 00:03:06.064\nWe are in the pre-paradigm days,\nif you want to use Thomas Kuhn.\n\n00:03:06.088 --> 00:03:07.427\nSo I fell in love with this.\n\n00:03:07.451 --> 00:03:11.026\nI said, look: We have all this knowledge\nabout brains -- how hard can it be?\n\n00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:14.488\nIt's something we can work on\nin my lifetime; I could make a difference.\n\n00:03:14.512 --> 00:03:18.131\nSo I tried to get out of the computer\nbusiness, into the brain business.\n\n00:03:18.155 --> 00:03:20.159\nFirst, I went to MIT,\nthe AI lab was there.\n\n00:03:20.183 --> 00:03:22.578\nI said, I want to build\nintelligent machines too,\n\n00:03:22.602 --> 00:03:25.119\nbut I want to study how brains work first.\n\n00:03:25.143 --> 00:03:27.449\nAnd they said, \"Oh, you\ndon't need to do that.\n\n00:03:27.473 --> 00:03:29.863\nYou're just going to program\ncomputers, that's all.\n\n00:03:29.887 --> 00:03:31.850\nI said, you really ought to study brains.\n\n00:03:31.874 --> 00:03:33.306\nThey said, \"No, you're wrong.\"\n\n00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:35.576\nI said, \"No, you're wrong,\"\nand I didn't get in.\n\n00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:36.678\n(Laughter)\n\n00:03:36.702 --> 00:03:38.857\nI was a little disappointed --\npretty young --\n\n00:03:38.881 --> 00:03:40.817\nbut I went back again a few years later,\n\n00:03:40.841 --> 00:03:43.200\nthis time in California,\nand I went to Berkeley.\n\n00:03:43.224 --> 00:03:45.654\nAnd I said, I'll go\nin from the biological side.\n\n00:03:45.678 --> 00:03:48.767\nSo I got in the PhD program in biophysics.\n\n00:03:48.791 --> 00:03:52.201\nI was like, I'm studying brains now.\nWell, I want to study theory.\n\n00:03:52.225 --> 00:03:54.494\nThey said, \"You can't\nstudy theory about brains.\n\n00:03:54.518 --> 00:03:56.513\nYou can't get funded for that.\n\n00:03:56.537 --> 00:03:58.692\nAnd as a graduate student,\nyou can't do that.\"\n\n00:03:58.716 --> 00:03:59.934\nSo I said, oh my gosh.\n\n00:03:59.958 --> 00:04:03.113\nI was depressed; I said, but I can\nmake a difference in this field.\n\n00:04:03.137 --> 00:04:05.145\nI went back in the computer industry\n\n00:04:05.169 --> 00:04:07.274\nand said, I'll have to work\nhere for a while.\n\n00:04:07.298 --> 00:04:09.691\nThat's when I designed\nall those computer products.\n\n00:04:09.715 --> 00:04:11.016\n(Laughter)\n\n00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:13.934\nI said, I want to do this\nfor four years, make some money,\n\n00:04:13.958 --> 00:04:17.934\nI was having a family,\nand I would mature a bit,\n\n00:04:17.958 --> 00:04:20.774\nand maybe the business\nof neuroscience would mature a bit.\n\n00:04:20.798 --> 00:04:23.799\nWell, it took longer than four years.\nIt's been about 16 years.\n\n00:04:23.823 --> 00:04:26.539\nBut I'm doing it now,\nand I'm going to tell you about it.\n\n00:04:26.563 --> 00:04:28.849\nSo why should we have a good brain theory?\n\n00:04:28.873 --> 00:04:31.975\nWell, there's lots of reasons\npeople do science.\n\n00:04:31.999 --> 00:04:34.916\nThe most basic one is,\npeople like to know things.\n\n00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:37.135\nWe're curious, and we go out\nand get knowledge.\n\n00:04:37.159 --> 00:04:39.025\nWhy do we study ants? It's interesting.\n\n00:04:39.049 --> 00:04:42.515\nMaybe we'll learn something useful,\nbut it's interesting and fascinating.\n\n00:04:42.539 --> 00:04:44.596\nBut sometimes a science\nhas other attributes\n\n00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:46.449\nwhich makes it really interesting.\n\n00:04:46.473 --> 00:04:49.100\nSometimes a science will tell\nsomething about ourselves;\n\n00:04:49.124 --> 00:04:50.348\nit'll tell us who we are.\n\n00:04:50.372 --> 00:04:53.124\nEvolution did this\nand Copernicus did this,\n\n00:04:53.148 --> 00:04:55.482\nwhere we have a new\nunderstanding of who we are.\n\n00:04:55.506 --> 00:04:58.934\nAnd after all, we are our brains.\nMy brain is talking to your brain.\n\n00:04:58.958 --> 00:05:00.988\nOur bodies are hanging along for the ride,\n\n00:05:01.012 --> 00:05:02.837\nbut my brain is talking to your brain.\n\n00:05:02.861 --> 00:05:06.109\nAnd if we want to understand\nwho we are and how we feel and perceive,\n\n00:05:06.133 --> 00:05:07.524\nwe need to understand brains.\n\n00:05:07.548 --> 00:05:11.332\nAnother thing is sometimes science leads\nto big societal benefits, technologies,\n\n00:05:11.356 --> 00:05:12.647\nor businesses or whatever.\n\n00:05:12.671 --> 00:05:15.549\nThis is one, too, because\nwhen we understand how brains work,\n\n00:05:15.573 --> 00:05:17.637\nwe'll be able to build\nintelligent machines.\n\n00:05:17.661 --> 00:05:19.359\nThat's a good thing on the whole,\n\n00:05:19.383 --> 00:05:21.241\nwith tremendous benefits to society,\n\n00:05:21.265 --> 00:05:22.934\njust like a fundamental technology.\n\n00:05:22.958 --> 00:05:25.808\nSo why don't we have\na good theory of brains?\n\n00:05:25.832 --> 00:05:28.000\nPeople have been working\non it for 100 years.\n\n00:05:28.024 --> 00:05:30.743\nLet's first take a look\nat what normal science looks like.\n\n00:05:30.767 --> 00:05:31.954\nThis is normal science.\n\n00:05:31.978 --> 00:05:36.052\nNormal science is a nice balance\nbetween theory and experimentalists.\n\n00:05:36.076 --> 00:05:38.767\nThe theorist guy says,\n\"I think this is what's going on,\"\n\n00:05:38.791 --> 00:05:40.752\nthe experimentalist says, \"You're wrong.\"\n\n00:05:40.776 --> 00:05:43.780\nIt goes back and forth,\nthis works in physics, this in geology.\n\n00:05:43.804 --> 00:05:46.813\nBut if this is normal science,\nwhat does neuroscience look like?\n\n00:05:46.837 --> 00:05:48.632\nThis is what neuroscience looks like.\n\n00:05:48.656 --> 00:05:50.098\nWe have this mountain of data,\n\n00:05:50.122 --> 00:05:52.192\nwhich is anatomy, physiology and behavior.\n\n00:05:52.216 --> 00:05:55.410\nYou can't imagine how much detail\nwe know about brains.\n\n00:05:55.434 --> 00:05:59.026\nThere were 28,000 people who went\nto the neuroscience conference this year,\n\n00:05:59.050 --> 00:06:01.413\nand every one of them\nis doing research in brains.\n\n00:06:01.437 --> 00:06:03.131\nA lot of data, but no theory.\n\n00:06:03.155 --> 00:06:05.155\nThere's a little wimpy box on top there.\n\n00:06:05.179 --> 00:06:08.561\nAnd theory has not played a role\nin any sort of grand way\n\n00:06:08.585 --> 00:06:10.014\nin the neurosciences.\n\n00:06:10.038 --> 00:06:11.278\nAnd it's a real shame.\n\n00:06:11.302 --> 00:06:12.693\nNow, why has this come about?\n\n00:06:12.717 --> 00:06:15.705\nIf you ask neuroscientists\nwhy is this the state of affairs,\n\n00:06:15.729 --> 00:06:16.975\nfirst, they'll admit it.\n\n00:06:16.999 --> 00:06:18.484\nBut if you ask them, they say,\n\n00:06:18.508 --> 00:06:21.240\nthere's various reasons\nwe don't have a good brain theory.\n\n00:06:21.264 --> 00:06:23.233\nSome say we still don't have enough data,\n\n00:06:23.257 --> 00:06:26.316\nwe need more information,\nthere's all these things we don't know.\n\n00:06:26.340 --> 00:06:29.181\nWell, I just told you there's data\ncoming out of your ears.\n\n00:06:29.205 --> 00:06:32.369\nWe have so much information,\nwe don't even know how to organize it.\n\n00:06:32.393 --> 00:06:33.831\nWhat good is more going to do?\n\n00:06:33.855 --> 00:06:37.303\nMaybe we'll be lucky and discover\nsome magic thing, but I don't think so.\n\n00:06:37.327 --> 00:06:40.300\nThis is a symptom of the fact\nthat we just don't have a theory.\n\n00:06:40.324 --> 00:06:42.934\nWe don't need more data,\nwe need a good theory.\n\n00:06:42.958 --> 00:06:44.756\nAnother one is sometimes people say,\n\n00:06:44.780 --> 00:06:47.934\n\"Brains are so complex,\nit'll take another 50 years.\"\n\n00:06:47.958 --> 00:06:51.312\nI even think Chris said something\nlike this yesterday, something like,\n\n00:06:51.336 --> 00:06:53.963\nit's one of the most complicated\nthings in the universe.\n\n00:06:53.987 --> 00:06:56.777\nThat's not true -- you're more\ncomplicated than your brain.\n\n00:06:56.801 --> 00:06:57.952\nYou've got a brain.\n\n00:06:57.976 --> 00:07:00.126\nAnd although the brain\nlooks very complicated,\n\n00:07:00.150 --> 00:07:02.486\nthings look complicated\nuntil you understand them.\n\n00:07:02.510 --> 00:07:03.845\nThat's always been the case.\n\n00:07:03.869 --> 00:07:07.112\nSo we can say, my neocortex,\nthe part of the brain I'm interested in,\n\n00:07:07.136 --> 00:07:08.288\nhas 30 billion cells.\n\n00:07:08.312 --> 00:07:10.744\nBut, you know what?\nIt's very, very regular.\n\n00:07:10.768 --> 00:07:14.162\nIn fact, it looks like it's the same thing\nrepeated over and over again.\n\n00:07:14.186 --> 00:07:16.722\nIt's not as complex as it looks.\nThat's not the issue.\n\n00:07:16.746 --> 00:07:19.033\nSome people say,\nbrains can't understand brains.\n\n00:07:19.057 --> 00:07:21.045\nVery Zen-like.

A lot of it.\n\n00:08:38.026 --> 00:08:40.820\nBut it got more manageable\nonce they had a theory.\n\n00:08:40.844 --> 00:08:43.651\nThe best minds were stumped --\nreally smart people.\n\n00:08:43.675 --> 00:08:45.679\nWe're not smarter now than they were then;\n\n00:08:45.703 --> 00:08:48.230\nit just turns out it's really\nhard to think of things,\n\n00:08:48.254 --> 00:08:50.930\nbut once you've thought of them,\nit's easy to understand.\n\n00:08:50.954 --> 00:08:53.060\nMy daughters understood\nthese three theories,\n\n00:08:53.084 --> 00:08:55.602\nin their basic framework, in kindergarten.\n\n00:08:55.626 --> 00:08:58.892\nIt's not that hard --\nhere's the apple, here's the orange,\n\n00:08:58.916 --> 00:09:00.934\nthe Earth goes around, that kind of stuff.\n\n00:09:00.958 --> 00:09:03.544\nAnother thing is the answer\nwas there all along,\n\n00:09:03.568 --> 00:09:06.347\nbut we kind of ignored it\nbecause of this obvious thing.\n\n00:09:06.371 --> 00:09:09.221\nIt was an intuitive,\nstrongly held belief that was wrong.\n\n00:09:09.245 --> 00:09:10.935\nIn the case of the solar system,\n\n00:09:10.959 --> 00:09:12.719\nthe idea that the Earth is spinning,\n\n00:09:12.743 --> 00:09:14.934\nthe surface is going\na thousand miles an hour,\n\n00:09:14.958 --> 00:09:18.207\nand it's going through the solar system\nat a million miles an hour --\n\n00:09:18.231 --> 00:09:20.707\nthis is lunacy; we all know\nthe Earth isn't moving.\n\n00:09:20.731 --> 00:09:23.608\nDo you feel like you're moving\na thousand miles an hour?\n\n00:09:23.632 --> 00:09:26.551\nIf you said Earth was spinning\naround in space and was huge --\n\n00:09:26.575 --> 00:09:29.166\nthey would lock you up,\nthat's what they did back then.\n\n00:09:29.190 --> 00:09:32.465\nSo it was intuitive and obvious.\nNow, what about evolution?\n\n00:09:32.489 --> 00:09:33.643\nEvolution, same thing.\n\n00:09:33.667 --> 00:09:36.747\nWe taught our kids the Bible says\nGod created all these species,\n\n00:09:36.771 --> 00:09:39.914\ncats are cats; dogs are dogs;\npeople are people; plants are plants;\n\n00:09:39.938 --> 00:09:41.179\nthey don't change.\n\n00:09:41.203 --> 00:09:43.852\nNoah put them on the ark\nin that order, blah, blah.\n\n00:09:43.876 --> 00:09:47.271\nThe fact is, if you believe in evolution,\nwe all have a common ancestor.\n\n00:09:47.295 --> 00:09:50.577\nWe all have a common ancestor\nwith the plant in the lobby!\n\n00:09:50.601 --> 00:09:54.287\nThis is what evolution tells us.\nAnd it's true.

It has fears\nand emotions.

It's your emotional brain.\n\n00:12:52.680 --> 00:12:55.410\nIt's all those gut reactions you have.\n\n00:12:55.434 --> 00:12:58.704\nOn top of it, we have this memory system\ncalled the neocortex.\n\n00:12:58.728 --> 00:13:03.022\nAnd the memory system is sitting\nover the sensory part of the brain.\n\n00:13:03.046 --> 00:13:06.101\nSo as the sensory input\ncomes in and feeds from the old brain,\n\n00:13:06.125 --> 00:13:08.279\nit also goes up into the neocortex.\n\n00:13:08.303 --> 00:13:10.216\nAnd the neocortex is just memorizing.\n\n00:13:10.240 --> 00:13:13.801\nIt's sitting there saying, I'm going\nto memorize all the things going on:\n\n00:13:13.825 --> 00:13:16.844\nwhere I've been, people I've seen,\nthings I've heard, and so on.\n\n00:13:16.868 --> 00:13:20.230\nAnd in the future, when it sees\nsomething similar to that again,\n\n00:13:20.254 --> 00:13:22.889\nin a similar environment,\nor the exact same environment,\n\n00:13:22.913 --> 00:13:26.468\nit'll start playing it back:\n\"Oh, I've been here before,\"\n\n00:13:26.492 --> 00:13:28.856\nand when you were here before,\nthis happened next.\n\n00:13:28.880 --> 00:13:30.606\nIt allows you to predict the future.\n\n00:13:30.630 --> 00:13:34.026\nIt literally feeds back\nthe signals into your brain;\n\n00:13:34.050 --> 00:13:36.315\nthey'll let you see\nwhat's going to happen next,\n\n00:13:36.339 --> 00:13:38.934\nwill let you hear the word\n\"sentence\" before I said it.\n\n00:13:38.958 --> 00:13:42.143\nAnd it's this feeding\nback into the old brain\n\n00:13:42.167 --> 00:13:44.744\nthat will allow you to make\nmore intelligent decisions.\n\n00:13:44.768 --> 00:13:48.257\nThis is the most important slide\nof my talk, so I'll dwell on it a little.\n\n00:13:48.281 --> 00:13:51.856\nAnd all the time you say,\n\"Oh, I can predict things,\"\n\n00:13:51.880 --> 00:13:55.240\nso if you're a rat and you go\nthrough a maze, and you learn the maze,\n\n00:13:55.264 --> 00:13:57.703\nnext time you're in one,\nyou have the same behavior.\n\n00:13:57.727 --> 00:14:00.718\nBut suddenly, you're smarter;\nyou say, \"I recognize this maze,\n\n00:14:00.742 --> 00:14:04.284\nI know which way to go; I've been here\nbefore; I can envision the future.\"\n\n00:14:04.308 --> 00:14:05.476\nThat's what it's doing.\n\n00:14:05.500 --> 00:14:08.340\nThis is true for all mammals --\n\n00:14:08.364 --> 00:14:10.395\nin humans, it got a lot worse.\n\n00:14:10.419 --> 00:14:13.006\nHumans actually developed\nthe front of the neocortex,\n\n00:14:13.030 --> 00:14:15.251\ncalled the anterior part of the neocortex.\n\n00:14:15.275 --> 00:14:16.713\nAnd nature did a little trick.\n\n00:14:16.737 --> 00:14:19.424\nIt copied the posterior,\nthe back part, which is sensory,\n\n00:14:19.448 --> 00:14:20.599\nand put it in the front.\n\n00:14:20.623 --> 00:14:23.103\nHumans uniquely have\nthe same mechanism on the front,\n\n00:14:23.127 --> 00:14:24.681\nbut we use it for motor control.\n\n00:14:24.705 --> 00:14:28.286\nSo we're now able to do very sophisticated\nmotor planning, things like that.\n\n00:14:28.310 --> 00:14:31.436\nI don't have time to explain,\nbut to understand how a brain works,\n\n00:14:31.460 --> 00:14:34.997\nyou have to understand how the first part\nof the mammalian neocortex works,\n\n00:14:35.021 --> 00:14:37.314\nhow it is we store patterns\nand make predictions.\n\n00:14:37.338 --> 00:14:39.526\nLet me give you\na few examples of predictions.\n\n00:14:39.550 --> 00:14:41.226\nI already said the word \"sentence.\"\n\n00:14:41.250 --> 00:14:44.456\nIn music, if you've heard a song before,\n\n00:14:44.480 --> 00:14:47.389\nwhen you hear it, the next note\npops into your head already --\n\n00:14:47.413 --> 00:14:48.564\nyou anticipate it.\n\n00:14:48.588 --> 00:14:51.942\nWith an album, at the end of a song,\nthe next song pops into your head.\n\n00:14:51.966 --> 00:14:54.271\nIt happens all the time,\nyou make predictions.\n\n00:14:54.295 --> 00:14:57.334\nI have this thing called\nthe \"altered door\" thought experiment.\n\n00:14:57.358 --> 00:15:00.187\nIt says, you have a door at home;\n\n00:15:00.211 --> 00:15:01.966\nwhen you're here, I'm changing it --\n\n00:15:01.990 --> 00:15:05.186\nI've got a guy back at your house\nright now, moving the door around,\n\n00:15:05.210 --> 00:15:06.979\nmoving your doorknob over two inches.\n\n00:15:07.003 --> 00:15:10.587\nWhen you go home tonight, you'll put\nyour hand out, reach for the doorknob,\n\n00:15:10.611 --> 00:15:12.125\nnotice it's in the wrong spot\n\n00:15:12.149 --> 00:15:13.836\nand go, \"Whoa, something happened.\"\n\n00:15:13.860 --> 00:15:15.961\nIt may take a second,\nbut something happened.\n\n00:15:15.985 --> 00:15:17.988\nI can change your doorknob\nin other ways --\n\n00:15:18.012 --> 00:15:21.253\nmake it larger, smaller, change\nits brass to silver, make it a lever,\n\n00:15:21.277 --> 00:15:23.853\nI can change the door;\nput colors on, put windows in.\n\n00:15:23.877 --> 00:15:26.028\nI can change a thousand things\nabout your door\n\n00:15:26.052 --> 00:15:28.060\nand in the two seconds\nyou take to open it,\n\n00:15:28.084 --> 00:15:29.806\nyou'll notice something has changed.\n\n00:15:29.830 --> 00:15:32.414\nNow, the engineering approach,\nthe AI approach to this,\n\n00:15:32.438 --> 00:15:35.113\nis to build a door database\nwith all the door attributes.\n\n00:15:35.137 --> 00:15:37.956\nAnd as you go up to the door,\nwe check them off one at time:\n\n00:15:37.980 --> 00:15:39.326\ndoor, door, color ...\n\n00:15:39.350 --> 00:15:41.450\nWe don't do that.\nYour brain doesn't do that.\n\n00:15:41.474 --> 00:15:44.014\nYour brain is making\nconstant predictions all the time\n\n00:15:44.038 --> 00:15:46.072\nabout what will happen\nin your environment.\n\n00:15:46.096 --> 00:15:48.842\nAs I put my hand on this table,\nI expect to feel it stop.\n\n00:15:48.866 --> 00:15:51.885\nWhen I walk, every step,\nif I missed it by an eighth of an inch,\n\n00:15:51.909 --> 00:15:53.442\nI'll know something has changed.\n\n00:15:53.466 --> 00:15:56.286\nYou're constantly making predictions\nabout your environment.\n\n00:15:56.310 --> 00:15:57.903\nI'll talk about vision, briefly.\n\n00:15:57.927 --> 00:15:59.310\nThis is a picture of a woman.\n\n00:15:59.334 --> 00:16:02.824\nWhen we look at people, our eyes saccade\nover two to three times a second.\n\n00:16:02.848 --> 00:16:05.377\nWe're not aware of it,\nbut our eyes are always moving.\n\n00:16:05.401 --> 00:16:08.836\nWhen we look at a face, we typically\ngo from eye to eye to nose to mouth.\n\n00:16:08.860 --> 00:16:10.729\nWhen your eye moves from eye to eye,\n\n00:16:10.753 --> 00:16:12.911\nif there was something\nelse there like a nose,\n\n00:16:12.935 --> 00:16:16.481\nyou'd see a nose where an eye\nis supposed to be and go, \"Oh, shit!\"\n\n00:16:16.505 --> 00:16:17.901\n(Laughter)\n\n00:16:17.925 --> 00:16:20.034\n\"There's something wrong\nabout this person.\"\n\n00:16:20.058 --> 00:16:22.063\nThat's because you're making a prediction.\n\n00:16:22.087 --> 00:16:25.526\nIt's not like you just look over and say,\n\"What am I seeing?

And it's a lively and a lovely place, but we're rapidly changing the oceans with our \u2014 not only with our overfishing, our irresponsible fishing, our adding of pollutants like fertilizer from our cropland, but also, most recently, with climate change, and Steve Schneider, I'm sure, will be going into greater detail on this. Now, as we continue to tinker with the oceans, more and more reports are predicting that the kinds of seas that we're creating will be conducive to low-energy type of animals, like jellyfish and bacteria. And this might be the kind of seas we're headed for.Now jellyfish are strangely hypnotic and beautiful, and you'll see lots of gorgeous ones at the aquarium on Friday, but they sting like hell, and jellyfish sushi and sashimi is just not going to fill you up. About 100 grams of jellyfish equals four calories. So it may be good for the waistline, but it probably won't keep you satiated for very long. And a sea that's just filled and teeming with jellyfish isn't very good for all the other creatures that live in the oceans, that is, unless you eat jellyfish. And this is this voracious predator launching a sneak attack on this poor little unsuspecting jellyfish there, a by-the-wind sailor. And that predator is the giant ocean sunfish, the Mola mola, whose primary prey are jellyfish.This animal is in \"The Guinness World Book of Records\" for being the world's heaviest bony fish. It reaches up to almost 5,000 pounds \u2014 on a diet of jellyfish, primarily. And I think it's kind of a nice little cosmological convergence here that the Mola mola \u2014 its common name is sunfish \u2014 that its favorite food is the moon jelly. So it's kind of nice, the sun and the moon getting together this way, even if one is eating the other. Now this is typically how you see sunfish, this is where they get their common name. They like to sunbathe, can't blame them. They just lay out on the surface of the sea and most people think they're sick or lazy, but that's a typical behavior, they lie out and bask on the surface.Their other name, Mola mola, is \u2014 it sounds Hawaiian, but it's actually Latin for millstone, and that's attributable to their roundish, very bizarre, cut-off shape. It's as if, as they were growing, they just forgot the tail part. And that's actually what drew me to the Mola in the first place, was this terribly bizarre shape. You know, you look at sharks, and they're streamlined, and they're sleek, and you look at tuna, and they're like torpedoes \u2014 they just give away their agenda. They're about migration and strength, and then you look at the sunfish.(Laughter)And this is just so elegantly mysterious, it's just \u2014 it really kind of holds its cards a lot tighter than say, a tuna. So I was just intrigued with what \u2014 you know, what is this animal's story? Well, as with anything in biology, nothing really makes sense except in the light of evolution. The Mola's no exception. They appeared shortly after the dinosaurs disappeared, 65 million years ago, at a time when whales still had legs, and they come from a rebellious little puffer fish faction \u2014 oblige me a little Kipling-esque storytelling here. Of course evolution is somewhat random, and you know, about 55 million years ago there was this rebellious little puffer fish faction that said, oh, the heck with the coral reefs \u2014 we're going to head to the high seas. And lots of generations, lots of tweaking and torquing, and we turn our puffer into the Mola. You know, if you give Mother Nature enough time, that is what she will produce.They look \u2014 maybe they look kind of prehistoric and unfinished, abridged perhaps, but in fact, in fact they are the \u2014 they vie for the top position of the most evolutionarily-derived fish in the sea, right up there with flat fish. They're \u2014 every single thing about that fish has been changed. And in terms of fishes \u2014 fishes appeared 500 million years ago, and they're pretty modern, just 50 million years ago, so \u2014 so interestingly, they give away their ancestry as they develop. They start as little eggs, and they're in \"The Guinness World Book of Records\" again for having the most number of eggs of any vertebrate on the planet. A single four-foot female had 300 million eggs, can carry 300 million eggs in her ovaries \u2014 imagine \u2014 and they get to be over 10 feet long. Imagine what a 10 foot one has. And from that little egg, they pass through this spiky little porcupine fish stage, reminiscent of their ancestry, and develop \u2014 this is their little adolescent stage. They school as adolescents, and become behemoth loners as adults. That's a little diver up there in the corner.They're in \"The Guinness World Book of Records\" again for being the vertebrate growth champion of the world. From their little hatching size of their egg, into their little larval stage till they reach adulthood, they put on 600 million times an increase in weight. 600 million. Now imagine if you gave birth to a little baby, and you had to feed this thing. That would mean that your child, you would expect it to gain the weight of six Titanics. Now I don't know how you'd feed a child like that but \u2014 we don't know how fast the Molas grow in the wild, but captive growth studies at the Monterey Bay Aquarium \u2014 one of the first places to have them in captivity \u2014 they had one that gained 800 lbs in 14 months. I said, now, that's a true American.(Laughter)(Applause)So being a loner is a great thing, especially in today's seas, because schooling used to be salvation for fishes, but it's suicide for fishes now. But unfortunately Molas, even though they don't school, they still get caught in nets as by-catch. If we're going to save the world from total jellyfish domination, then we've got to figure out what the jellyfish predators \u2014 how they live their lives, like the Mola. And unfortunately, they make up a large portion of the California by-catch \u2014 up to 26 percent of the drift net. And in the Mediterranean, in the swordfish net fisheries, they make up up to 90 percent. So we've got to figure out how they're living their lives. And how do you do that? How do you do that with an animal \u2014 very few places in the world. This is an open ocean creature. It knows no boundaries \u2014 it doesn't go to land.How do you get insight? How do you seduce an open ocean creature like that to spill its secrets? Well, there's some great new technology that has just recently become available, and it's just a boon for getting insight into open ocean animals. And it's pictured right here, that little tag up there. That little tag can record temperature, depth and light intensity, which is correlated with time, and from that we can get locations. And it can record this data for up to two years, and keep it in that tag, release at a pre-programmed time, float to the surface, upload all that data, that whole travelogue, to satellite, which relays it directly to our computers, and we've got that whole dataset. And we didn't even have \u2014 we just had to tag the animal and then we went home and you know, sat at our desks. So the great thing about the Mola is that when we put the tag on them \u2014 if you look up here \u2014 that's streaming off, that's right where we put the tag. And it just so happens that's a parasite hanging off the Mola.Molas are infamous for carrying tons of parasites. They're just parasite hotels; even their parasites have parasites. I think Donne wrote a poem about that. But they have 40 genera of parasites, and so we figured just one more parasite won't be too much of a problem. And they happen to be a very good vehicle for carrying oceanographic equipment. They don't seem to mind, so far. So what are we trying to find out? We're focusing on the Pacific. We're tagging on the California coast, and we're tagging over in Taiwan and Japan. And we're interested in how these animals are using the currents, using temperature, using the open ocean, to live their lives. We'd love to tag in Monterey. Monterey is one of the few places in the world where Molas come in large numbers. Not this time of year \u2014 it's more around October.And we'd love to tag here \u2014 this is an aerial shot of Monterey \u2014 but unfortunately, the Molas here end up looking like this because another one of our locals really likes Molas but in the wrong way. The California sea lion takes the Molas as soon as they come into the bay, rips off their fins, fashions them into the ultimate Frisbee, Mola style, and then tosses them back and forth. And I'm not exaggerating, it is just \u2014 and sometimes they don't eat them, it's just spiteful. And you know, the locals think it's terrible behavior, it's just horrible watching this happen, day after day. The poor little Molas coming in, getting ripped to shreds, so we head down south, to San Diego. Not so many California sea lions down there. And the Molas there, you can find them with a spotter plane very easily, and they like to hang out under floating rafts of kelp. And under those kelps \u2014 this is why the Molas come there because it's spa time for the Molas there. As soon as they get under those rafts of kelp, the exfoliating cleaner fish come. And they come and give the Molas \u2014 you can see they strike this funny little position that says, \"I'm not threatening, but I need a massage.\"(Laughter)And they'll put their fins out and their eyes go in the back of their head, and the fish come up and they just clean, clean, clean \u2014 because the Molas, you know, there's just a smorgasbord of parasites. And it's also a great place to go down south because the water's warmer, and the Molas are kind of friendly down there. I mean what other kind of fish, if you approach it right, will say, \"Okay, scratch me right there.\" You truly can swim up to a Mola \u2014 they're very gentle \u2014 and if you approach them right, you can give them a scratch and they enjoy it. So we've also tagged one part of the Pacific; we've gone over to another part of the Pacific, and we've tagged in Taiwan, and we tagged in Japan. And over in these places, the Molas are caught in set nets that line these countries. And they're not thrown back as by-catch, they're eaten. We were served a nine-course meal of Mola after we tagged. Well, not the one we tagged! And everything from the kidney, to the testes, to the back bone, to the fin muscle to \u2014 I think that \u00eds pretty much the whole fish \u2014 is eaten.So the hardest part of tagging, now, is after you put that tag on, you have to wait, months. And you're just wondering, oh, I hope the fish is safe, I hope, I hope it's going to be able to actually live its life out during the course that the tag is recording. The tags cost 3500 dollars each, and then satellite time is another 500 dollars, so you're like, oh, I hope the tag is okay. And so the waiting is really the hardest part. I'm going to show you our latest dataset. And it hasn't been published, so it's totally privy information just for TED. And in showing you this, you know, when we're looking at this data, we're thinking, oh do these animals, do they cross the equator? Do they go from one side of the Pacific to the other? And we found that they kind of are homebodies. They're not big migrators. This is their track: we deployed the tag off of Tokyo, and the Mola in one month kind of got into the Kuroshio Current off of Japan and foraged there. And after four months, went up, you know, off of the north part of Japan. And that's kind of their home range. Now that's important, though, because if there's a lot of fishing pressure, that population doesn't get replenished. So that's a very important piece of data.But also what's important is that they're not slacker, lazy fish. They're super industrious. And this is a day in the life of a Mola, and if we \u2014 they're up and down, and up and down, and up and down, and up and up and down, up to 40 times a day. As the sun comes up, you see in the blue, they start their dive. Down \u2014 and as the sun gets brighter they go a little deeper, little deeper. They plumb the depths down to 600 meters, in temperatures to one degree centigrade, and this is why you see them on the surface \u2014 it's so cold down there. They've got to come up, warm, get that solar power, and then plunge back into the depths, and go up and down and up and down. And they're hitting a layer down there; it's called the deep scattering layer \u2014 which a whole variety of food's in that layer. So rather than just being some sunbathing slacker, they're really very industrious fish that dance this wild dance between the surface and the bottom and through temperature.We see the same pattern \u2014 now with these tags we're seeing a similar pattern for swordfishes, manta rays, tunas, a real three-dimensional play. This is part of a much larger program called the Census of Marine Life, where they're going to be tagging all over the world and the Mola's going to enter into that. And what's exciting \u2014 you all travel, and you know the best thing about traveling is to be able to find the locals, and to find the great places by getting the local knowledge. Well now with the Census of Marine Life, we'll be able to sidle up to all the locals and explore 90 percent of our living space, with local knowledge. It's never \u2014 it's really never been a more exciting, or a vital time, to be a biologist.Which brings me to my last point, and what I think is kind of the most fun. I set up a website because I was getting so many questions about Molas and sunfish. And so I just figured I'd have the questions answered, and I'd be able to thank my funders, like National Geographic and Lindbergh. But people would write into the site with all sorts of, all sorts of stories about these animals and wanting to help me get samples for genetic analysis. And what I found most exciting is that everyone had a shared \u2014 a shared love and an interest in the oceans. I was getting reports from Catholic nuns, Jewish Rabbis, Muslims, Christians \u2014 everybody writing in, united by their love of life. And to me that \u2014 I don't think I could say it any better than the immortal Bard himself: \"One touch of nature makes the whole world kin.\" And sure, it may be just one big old silly fish, but it's helping. If it's helping to unite the world, I think it's definitely the fish of the future.", "id": 126, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:11.958 --> 00:00:15.958\nI'd like to start tonight by something completely different,\n\n00:00:15.958 --> 00:00:19.958\nasking you to join me by stepping off the land\n\n00:00:19.958 --> 00:00:24.958\nand jumping into the open ocean for a moment.\n\n00:00:24.958 --> 00:00:29.958\n90 percent of the living space on the planet is in the open ocean,\n\n00:00:29.958 --> 00:00:34.958\nand it's where life -- the title of our seminar tonight -- it's where life began.\n\n00:00:34.958 --> 00:00:37.958\nAnd it's a lively and a lovely place,\n\n00:00:37.958 --> 00:00:41.958\nbut we're rapidly changing the oceans with our --\n\n00:00:41.958 --> 00:00:46.958\nnot only with our overfishing, our irresponsible fishing,\n\n00:00:46.958 --> 00:00:51.958\nour adding of pollutants like fertilizer from our cropland,\n\n00:00:51.958 --> 00:00:53.958\nbut also, most recently, with climate change,\n\n00:00:53.958 --> 00:00:56.958\nand Steve Schneider, I'm sure, will be going into greater detail on this.\n\n00:00:56.958 --> 00:00:59.958\nNow, as we continue to tinker with the oceans,\n\n00:00:59.958 --> 00:01:04.958\nmore and more reports are predicting that the kinds of seas that we're creating\n\n00:01:04.958 --> 00:01:09.958\nwill be conducive to low-energy type of animals, like jellyfish and bacteria.\n\n00:01:09.958 --> 00:01:12.958\nAnd this might be the kind of seas we're headed for.\n\n00:01:12.958 --> 00:01:16.958\nNow jellyfish are strangely hypnotic and beautiful,\n\n00:01:16.958 --> 00:01:21.958\nand you'll see lots of gorgeous ones at the aquarium on Friday,\n\n00:01:21.958 --> 00:01:26.958\nbut they sting like hell, and jellyfish sushi and sashimi\n\n00:01:26.958 --> 00:01:28.958\nis just not going to fill you up.\n\n00:01:28.958 --> 00:01:33.958\nAbout 100 grams of jellyfish equals four calories.\n\n00:01:33.958 --> 00:01:35.958\nSo it may be good for the waistline,\n\n00:01:35.958 --> 00:01:38.958\nbut it probably won't keep you satiated for very long.\n\n00:01:38.958 --> 00:01:43.958\nAnd a sea that's just filled and teeming with jellyfish\n\n00:01:43.958 --> 00:01:46.958\nisn't very good for all the other creatures that live in the oceans,\n\n00:01:46.958 --> 00:01:49.958\nthat is, unless you eat jellyfish.\n\n00:01:49.958 --> 00:01:53.958\nAnd this is this voracious predator launching a sneak attack\n\n00:01:53.958 --> 00:01:57.958\non this poor little unsuspecting jellyfish there, a by-the-wind sailor.\n\n00:01:57.958 --> 00:02:01.958\nAnd that predator is the giant ocean sunfish, the Mola mola,\n\n00:02:03.958 --> 00:02:06.958\nwhose primary prey are jellyfish.\n\n00:02:06.958 --> 00:02:08.958\nThis animal is in \"The Guinness World Book of Records\"\n\n00:02:08.958 --> 00:02:10.958\nfor being the world's heaviest bony fish.\n\n00:02:10.958 --> 00:02:17.958\nIt reaches up to almost 5,000 pounds -- on a diet of jellyfish, primarily.\n\n00:02:17.958 --> 00:02:21.958\nAnd I think it's kind of a nice little cosmological convergence here\n\n00:02:21.958 --> 00:02:24.958\nthat the Mola mola -- its common name is sunfish --\n\n00:02:24.958 --> 00:02:28.958\nthat its favorite food is the moon jelly.\n\n00:02:28.958 --> 00:02:32.958\nSo it's kind of nice, the sun and the moon getting together this way,\n\n00:02:32.958 --> 00:02:35.958\neven if one is eating the other.\n\n00:02:37.958 --> 00:02:40.958\nNow this is typically how you see sunfish,\n\n00:02:40.958 --> 00:02:42.958\nthis is where they get their common name.\n\n00:02:42.958 --> 00:02:44.958\nThey like to sunbathe, can't blame them.\n\n00:02:44.958 --> 00:02:47.958\nThey just lay out on the surface of the sea\n\n00:02:47.958 --> 00:02:51.958\nand most people think they're sick or lazy, but that's a typical behavior,\n\n00:02:51.958 --> 00:02:54.958\nthey lie out and bask on the surface.\n\n00:02:54.958 --> 00:02:57.958\nTheir other name, Mola mola, is -- it sounds Hawaiian,\n\n00:02:57.958 --> 00:03:00.958\nbut it's actually Latin for millstone,\n\n00:03:00.958 --> 00:03:06.958\nand that's attributable to their roundish, very bizarre, cut-off shape.\n\n00:03:06.958 --> 00:03:10.958\nIt's as if, as they were growing, they just forgot the tail part.\n\n00:03:10.958 --> 00:03:14.958\nAnd that's actually what drew me to the Mola in the first place,\n\n00:03:14.958 --> 00:03:16.958\nwas this terribly bizarre shape.\n\n00:03:17.958 --> 00:03:22.958\nYou know, you look at sharks, and they're streamlined, and they're sleek,\n\n00:03:22.958 --> 00:03:25.958\nand you look at tuna, and they're like torpedoes --\n\n00:03:25.958 --> 00:03:29.958\nthey just give away their agenda. They're about migration and strength,\n\n00:03:29.958 --> 00:03:32.958\nand then you look at the sunfish.\n\n00:03:32.958 --> 00:03:34.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:03:34.958 --> 00:03:41.958\nAnd this is just so elegantly mysterious, it's just --\n\n00:03:41.958 --> 00:03:45.958\nit really kind of holds its cards a lot tighter than say, a tuna.\n\n00:03:48.958 --> 00:03:53.958\nSo I was just intrigued with what -- you know, what is this animal's story?\n\n00:03:54.958 --> 00:03:57.958\nWell, as with anything in biology, nothing really makes sense\n\n00:03:57.958 --> 00:03:59.958\nexcept in the light of evolution.\n\n00:03:59.958 --> 00:04:01.958\nThe Mola's no exception.\n\n00:04:01.958 --> 00:04:04.958\nThey appeared shortly after the dinosaurs disappeared,\n\n00:04:05.958 --> 00:04:09.958\n65 million years ago, at a time when whales still had legs,\n\n00:04:09.958 --> 00:04:15.958\nand they come from a rebellious little puffer fish faction --\n\n00:04:15.958 --> 00:04:18.958\noblige me a little Kipling-esque storytelling here.\n\n00:04:18.958 --> 00:04:21.958\nOf course evolution is somewhat random, and you know,\n\n00:04:21.958 --> 00:04:25.958\nabout 55 million years ago there was this rebellious little puffer fish faction\n\n00:04:25.958 --> 00:04:27.958\nthat said, oh, the heck with the coral reefs --\n\n00:04:27.958 --> 00:04:29.958\nwe're going to head to the high seas.\n\n00:04:29.958 --> 00:04:34.958\nAnd lots of generations, lots of tweaking and torquing,\n\n00:04:34.958 --> 00:04:36.958\nand we turn our puffer into the Mola.\n\n00:04:36.958 --> 00:04:42.958\nYou know, if you give Mother Nature enough time, that is what she will produce.\n\n00:04:44.958 --> 00:04:46.958\nThey look -- maybe they look\n\n00:04:46.958 --> 00:04:50.958\nkind of prehistoric and unfinished, abridged perhaps,\n\n00:04:50.958 --> 00:04:54.958\nbut in fact, in fact they are the --\n\n00:04:54.958 --> 00:05:00.958\nthey vie for the top position of the most evolutionarily-derived fish in the sea,\n\n00:05:00.958 --> 00:05:03.958\nright up there with flat fish.\n\n00:05:03.958 --> 00:05:07.958\nThey're -- every single thing about that fish has been changed.\n\n00:05:07.958 --> 00:05:09.958\nAnd in terms of fishes --\n\n00:05:09.958 --> 00:05:15.958\nfishes appeared 500 million years ago, and they're pretty modern,\n\n00:05:15.958 --> 00:05:17.958\njust 50 million years ago, so --\n\n00:05:19.958 --> 00:05:24.958\nso interestingly, they give away their ancestry as they develop.\n\n00:05:24.958 --> 00:05:26.958\nThey start as little eggs,\n\n00:05:26.958 --> 00:05:28.958\nand they're in \"The Guinness World Book of Records\" again\n\n00:05:28.958 --> 00:05:32.958\nfor having the most number of eggs of any vertebrate on the planet.\n\n00:05:32.958 --> 00:05:38.958\nA single four-foot female had 300 million eggs,\n\n00:05:38.958 --> 00:05:41.958\ncan carry 300 million eggs in her ovaries -- imagine --\n\n00:05:41.958 --> 00:05:46.958\nand they get to be over 10 feet long. Imagine what a 10 foot one has.\n\n00:05:46.958 --> 00:05:48.958\nAnd from that little egg,\n\n00:05:48.958 --> 00:05:53.958\nthey pass through this spiky little porcupine fish stage, reminiscent of their ancestry,\n\n00:05:53.958 --> 00:05:56.958\nand develop -- this is their little adolescent stage.\n\n00:05:56.958 --> 00:06:03.958\nThey school as adolescents, and become behemoth loners as adults.\n\n00:06:03.958 --> 00:06:05.958\nThat's a little diver up there in the corner.\n\n00:06:06.958 --> 00:06:09.958\nThey're in \"The Guinness World Book of Records\" again\n\n00:06:09.958 --> 00:06:12.958\nfor being the vertebrate growth champion of the world.\n\n00:06:12.958 --> 00:06:16.958\nFrom their little hatching size of their egg, into their little larval stage\n\n00:06:16.958 --> 00:06:22.958\ntill they reach adulthood, they put on 600 million times an increase in weight.\n\n00:06:22.958 --> 00:06:28.958\n600 million. Now imagine if you gave birth to a little baby,\n\n00:06:28.958 --> 00:06:31.958\nand you had to feed this thing.\n\n00:06:32.958 --> 00:06:37.958\nThat would mean that your child, you would expect it to gain the weight of six Titanics.\n\n00:06:39.958 --> 00:06:42.958\nNow I don't know how you'd feed a child like that but --\n\n00:06:42.958 --> 00:06:48.958\nwe don't know how fast the Molas grow in the wild,\n\n00:06:48.958 --> 00:06:51.958\nbut captive growth studies at the Monterey Bay Aquarium --\n\n00:06:51.958 --> 00:06:53.958\none of the first places to have them in captivity --\n\n00:06:53.958 --> 00:06:57.958\nthey had one that gained 800 lbs in 14 months.\n\n00:06:57.958 --> 00:07:00.958\nI said, now, that's a true American.\n\n00:07:00.958 --> 00:07:04.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:07:04.958 --> 00:07:06.958\n(Applause)\n\n00:07:06.958 --> 00:07:10.958\nSo being a loner is a great thing, especially in today's seas,\n\n00:07:10.958 --> 00:07:13.958\nbecause schooling used to be salvation for fishes,\n\n00:07:13.958 --> 00:07:16.958\nbut it's suicide for fishes now.\n\n00:07:16.958 --> 00:07:18.958\nBut unfortunately Molas, even though they don't school,\n\n00:07:18.958 --> 00:07:20.958\nthey still get caught in nets as by-catch.\n\n00:07:20.958 --> 00:07:25.958\nIf we're going to save the world from total jellyfish domination,\n\n00:07:25.958 --> 00:07:27.958\nthen we've got to figure out what the jellyfish predators --\n\n00:07:27.958 --> 00:07:29.958\nhow they live their lives, like the Mola.\n\n00:07:29.958 --> 00:07:34.958\nAnd unfortunately, they make up a large portion of the California by-catch --\n\n00:07:34.958 --> 00:07:36.958\nup to 26 percent of the drift net.\n\n00:07:36.958 --> 00:07:41.958\nAnd in the Mediterranean, in the swordfish net fisheries,\n\n00:07:41.958 --> 00:07:44.958\nthey make up up to 90 percent.\n\n00:07:45.958 --> 00:07:48.958\nSo we've got to figure out how they're living their lives.\n\n00:07:48.958 --> 00:07:50.958\nAnd how do you do that?\n\n00:07:50.958 --> 00:07:53.958\nHow do you do that with an animal -- very few places in the world.\n\n00:07:53.958 --> 00:07:57.958\nThis is an open ocean creature. It knows no boundaries -- it doesn't go to land.\n\n00:07:57.958 --> 00:07:59.958\nHow do you get insight?\n\n00:07:59.958 --> 00:08:04.958\nHow do you seduce an open ocean creature like that to spill its secrets?\n\n00:08:04.958 --> 00:08:07.958\nWell, there's some great new technology\n\n00:08:07.958 --> 00:08:09.958\nthat has just recently become available,\n\n00:08:09.958 --> 00:08:13.958\nand it's just a boon for getting insight into open ocean animals.\n\n00:08:13.958 --> 00:08:17.958\nAnd it's pictured right here, that little tag up there.\n\n00:08:17.958 --> 00:08:22.958\nThat little tag can record temperature, depth and light intensity,\n\n00:08:22.958 --> 00:08:26.958\nwhich is correlated with time, and from that we can get locations.\n\n00:08:26.958 --> 00:08:30.958\nAnd it can record this data for up to two years,\n\n00:08:30.958 --> 00:08:34.958\nand keep it in that tag, release at a pre-programmed time,\n\n00:08:34.958 --> 00:08:38.958\nfloat to the surface, upload all that data, that whole travelogue,\n\n00:08:38.958 --> 00:08:41.958\nto satellite, which relays it directly to our computers,\n\n00:08:41.958 --> 00:08:45.958\nand we've got that whole dataset. And we didn't even have --\n\n00:08:45.958 --> 00:08:49.958\nwe just had to tag the animal and then we went home and you know, sat at our desks.\n\n00:08:50.958 --> 00:08:52.958\nSo the great thing about the Mola\n\n00:08:52.958 --> 00:08:55.958\nis that when we put the tag on them -- if you look up here --\n\n00:08:55.958 --> 00:08:57.958\nthat's streaming off, that's right where we put the tag.\n\n00:08:57.958 --> 00:09:01.958\nAnd it just so happens that's a parasite hanging off the Mola.\n\n00:09:01.958 --> 00:09:04.958\nMolas are infamous for carrying tons of parasites.\n\n00:09:04.958 --> 00:09:08.958\nThey're just parasite hotels; even their parasites have parasites.\n\n00:09:08.958 --> 00:09:10.958\nI think Donne wrote a poem about that.\n\n00:09:10.958 --> 00:09:13.958\nBut they have 40 genera of parasites,\n\n00:09:13.958 --> 00:09:17.958\nand so we figured just one more parasite won't be too much of a problem.\n\n00:09:17.958 --> 00:09:22.958\nAnd they happen to be a very good vehicle for carrying oceanographic equipment.\n\n00:09:22.958 --> 00:09:24.958\nThey don't seem to mind, so far.\n\n00:09:25.958 --> 00:09:29.958\nSo what are we trying to find out? We're focusing on the Pacific.\n\n00:09:29.958 --> 00:09:33.958\nWe're tagging on the California coast, and we're tagging over in Taiwan and Japan.\n\n00:09:33.958 --> 00:09:36.958\nAnd we're interested in how these animals are using the currents,\n\n00:09:36.958 --> 00:09:42.958\nusing temperature, using the open ocean, to live their lives.\n\n00:09:42.958 --> 00:09:44.958\nWe'd love to tag in Monterey.\n\n00:09:44.958 --> 00:09:48.958\nMonterey is one of the few places in the world where Molas come in large numbers.\n\n00:09:48.958 --> 00:09:51.958\nNot this time of year -- it's more around October.\n\n00:09:51.958 --> 00:09:54.958\nAnd we'd love to tag here -- this is an aerial shot of Monterey --\n\n00:09:54.958 --> 00:09:58.958\nbut unfortunately, the Molas here end up looking like this\n\n00:09:58.958 --> 00:10:02.958\nbecause another one of our locals really likes Molas but in the wrong way.\n\n00:10:02.958 --> 00:10:06.958\nThe California sea lion takes the Molas as soon as they come into the bay,\n\n00:10:06.958 --> 00:10:11.958\nrips off their fins, fashions them into the ultimate Frisbee, Mola style,\n\n00:10:11.958 --> 00:10:13.958\nand then tosses them back and forth.\n\n00:10:13.958 --> 00:10:16.958\nAnd I'm not exaggerating, it is just --\n\n00:10:16.958 --> 00:10:19.958\nand sometimes they don't eat them, it's just spiteful.\n\n00:10:19.958 --> 00:10:24.958\nAnd you know, the locals think it's terrible behavior,\n\n00:10:24.958 --> 00:10:29.958\nit's just horrible watching this happen, day after day.\n\n00:10:29.958 --> 00:10:32.958\nThe poor little Molas coming in, getting ripped to shreds,\n\n00:10:32.958 --> 00:10:36.958\nso we head down south, to San Diego.\n\n00:10:36.958 --> 00:10:38.958\nNot so many California sea lions down there.\n\n00:10:38.958 --> 00:10:41.958\nAnd the Molas there, you can find them with a spotter plane very easily,\n\n00:10:41.958 --> 00:10:44.958\nand they like to hang out under floating rafts of kelp.\n\n00:10:44.958 --> 00:10:47.958\nAnd under those kelps -- this is why the Molas come there\n\n00:10:47.958 --> 00:10:51.958\nbecause it's spa time for the Molas there.\n\n00:10:51.958 --> 00:10:55.958\nAs soon as they get under those rafts of kelp, the exfoliating cleaner fish come.\n\n00:10:55.958 --> 00:10:57.958\nAnd they come and give the Molas --\n\n00:10:57.958 --> 00:11:00.958\nyou can see they strike this funny little position that says,\n\n00:11:00.958 --> 00:11:02.958\n\"I'm not threatening, but I need a massage.\"\n\n00:11:02.958 --> 00:11:06.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:11:06.958 --> 00:11:10.958\nAnd they'll put their fins out and their eyes go in the back of their head,\n\n00:11:10.958 --> 00:11:14.958\nand the fish come up and they just clean, clean, clean --\n\n00:11:14.958 --> 00:11:18.958\nbecause the Molas, you know, there's just a smorgasbord of parasites.\n\n00:11:18.958 --> 00:11:20.958\nAnd it's also a great place to go down south\n\n00:11:20.958 --> 00:11:24.958\nbecause the water's warmer, and the Molas are kind of friendly down there.\n\n00:11:24.958 --> 00:11:27.958\nI mean what other kind of fish, if you approach it right,\n\n00:11:27.958 --> 00:11:29.958\nwill say, \"Okay, scratch me right there.\"\n\n00:11:29.958 --> 00:11:32.958\nYou truly can swim up to a Mola -- they're very gentle --\n\n00:11:32.958 --> 00:11:36.958\nand if you approach them right, you can give them a scratch and they enjoy it.\n\n00:11:38.958 --> 00:11:40.958\nSo we've also tagged one part of the Pacific;\n\n00:11:40.958 --> 00:11:42.958\nwe've gone over to another part of the Pacific,\n\n00:11:42.958 --> 00:11:45.958\nand we've tagged in Taiwan, and we tagged in Japan.\n\n00:11:46.958 --> 00:11:51.958\nAnd over in these places, the Molas are caught in set nets that line these countries.\n\n00:11:51.958 --> 00:11:54.958\nAnd they're not thrown back as by-catch, they're eaten.\n\n00:11:54.958 --> 00:11:58.958\nWe were served a nine-course meal of Mola after we tagged.\n\n00:11:59.958 --> 00:12:01.958\nWell, not the one we tagged!\n\n00:12:02.958 --> 00:12:05.958\nAnd everything from the kidney, to the testes, to the back bone,\n\n00:12:05.958 --> 00:12:12.958\nto the fin muscle to -- I think that \u00eds pretty much the whole fish -- is eaten.\n\n00:12:18.958 --> 00:12:22.958\nSo the hardest part of tagging, now, is\n\n00:12:22.958 --> 00:12:27.958\nafter you put that tag on, you have to wait, months.\n\n00:12:27.958 --> 00:12:31.958\nAnd you're just wondering, oh, I hope the fish is safe,\n\n00:12:31.958 --> 00:12:35.958\nI hope, I hope it's going to be able to actually live its life out\n\n00:12:35.958 --> 00:12:38.958\nduring the course that the tag is recording.\n\n00:12:38.958 --> 00:12:44.958\nThe tags cost 3500 dollars each, and then satellite time is another 500 dollars,\n\n00:12:44.958 --> 00:12:47.958\nso you're like, oh, I hope the tag is okay.\n\n00:12:47.958 --> 00:12:50.958\nAnd so the waiting is really the hardest part.\n\n00:12:50.958 --> 00:12:52.958\nI'm going to show you our latest dataset.\n\n00:12:52.958 --> 00:12:57.958\nAnd it hasn't been published, so it's totally privy information just for TED.\n\n00:12:57.958 --> 00:13:01.958\nAnd in showing you this, you know, when we're looking at this data,\n\n00:13:01.958 --> 00:13:04.958\nwe're thinking, oh do these animals, do they cross the equator?\n\n00:13:04.958 --> 00:13:06.958\nDo they go from one side of the Pacific to the other?\n\n00:13:06.958 --> 00:13:10.958\nAnd we found that they kind of are homebodies.\n\n00:13:11.958 --> 00:13:13.958\nThey're not big migrators. This is their track:\n\n00:13:13.958 --> 00:13:17.958\nwe deployed the tag off of Tokyo, and the Mola in one month\n\n00:13:17.958 --> 00:13:22.958\nkind of got into the Kuroshio Current off of Japan and foraged there.\n\n00:13:22.958 --> 00:13:26.958\nAnd after four months, went up, you know, off of the north part of Japan.\n\n00:13:26.958 --> 00:13:28.958\nAnd that's kind of their home range.\n\n00:13:28.958 --> 00:13:32.958\nNow that's important, though, because if there's a lot of fishing pressure,\n\n00:13:32.958 --> 00:13:35.958\nthat population doesn't get replenished.\n\n00:13:35.958 --> 00:13:37.958\nSo that's a very important piece of data.\n\n00:13:37.958 --> 00:13:43.958\nBut also what's important is that they're not slacker, lazy fish.\n\n00:13:43.958 --> 00:13:45.958\nThey're super industrious.\n\n00:13:45.958 --> 00:13:48.958\nAnd this is a day in the life of a Mola, and if we --\n\n00:13:48.958 --> 00:13:52.958\nthey're up and down, and up and down, and up and down, and up\n\n00:13:52.958 --> 00:13:54.958\nand up and down, up to 40 times a day.\n\n00:13:54.958 --> 00:13:59.958\nAs the sun comes up, you see in the blue, they start their dive.\n\n00:13:59.958 --> 00:14:03.958\nDown -- and as the sun gets brighter they go a little deeper, little deeper.\n\n00:14:03.958 --> 00:14:09.958\nThey plumb the depths down to 600 meters, in temperatures to one degree centigrade,\n\n00:14:09.958 --> 00:14:13.958\nand this is why you see them on the surface -- it's so cold down there.\n\n00:14:13.958 --> 00:14:15.958\nThey've got to come up, warm, get that solar power,\n\n00:14:15.958 --> 00:14:18.958\nand then plunge back into the depths, and go up and down and up and down.\n\n00:14:18.958 --> 00:14:21.958\nAnd they're hitting a layer down there; it's called the deep scattering layer --\n\n00:14:21.958 --> 00:14:26.958\nwhich a whole variety of food's in that layer.\n\n00:14:26.958 --> 00:14:30.958\nSo rather than just being some sunbathing slacker,\n\n00:14:30.958 --> 00:14:33.958\nthey're really very industrious fish that dance this wild dance\n\n00:14:33.958 --> 00:14:38.958\nbetween the surface and the bottom and through temperature.\n\n00:14:38.958 --> 00:14:41.958\nWe see the same pattern -- now with these tags\n\n00:14:41.958 --> 00:14:45.958\nwe're seeing a similar pattern for swordfishes, manta rays, tunas,\n\n00:14:45.958 --> 00:14:48.958\na real three-dimensional play.\n\n00:14:50.958 --> 00:14:53.958\nThis is part of a much larger program called the Census of Marine Life,\n\n00:14:53.958 --> 00:14:56.958\nwhere they're going to be tagging all over the world\n\n00:14:56.958 --> 00:14:58.958\nand the Mola's going to enter into that.\n\n00:14:58.958 --> 00:15:01.958\nAnd what's exciting -- you all travel, and you know\n\n00:15:01.958 --> 00:15:04.958\nthe best thing about traveling is to be able to find the locals,\n\n00:15:04.958 --> 00:15:07.958\nand to find the great places by getting the local knowledge.\n\n00:15:07.958 --> 00:15:11.958\nWell now with the Census of Marine Life, we'll be able to sidle up to all the locals\n\n00:15:11.958 --> 00:15:16.958\nand explore 90 percent of our living space, with local knowledge.\n\n00:15:16.958 --> 00:15:22.958\nIt's never -- it's really never been a more exciting, or a vital time, to be a biologist.\n\n00:15:22.958 --> 00:15:26.958\nWhich brings me to my last point, and what I think is kind of the most fun.\n\n00:15:26.958 --> 00:15:34.958\nI set up a website because I was getting so many questions about Molas and sunfish.\n\n00:15:34.958 --> 00:15:38.958\nAnd so I just figured I'd have the questions answered,\n\n00:15:38.958 --> 00:15:42.958\nand I'd be able to thank my funders, like National Geographic and Lindbergh.\n\n00:15:42.958 --> 00:15:46.958\nBut people would write into the site with all sorts of,\n\n00:15:46.958 --> 00:15:49.958\nall sorts of stories about these animals\n\n00:15:49.958 --> 00:15:53.958\nand wanting to help me get samples for genetic analysis.\n\n00:15:53.958 --> 00:16:00.958\nAnd what I found most exciting is that everyone had a shared --\n\n00:16:00.958 --> 00:16:03.958\na shared love and an interest in the oceans.\n\n00:16:03.958 --> 00:16:07.958\nI was getting reports from Catholic nuns,\n\n00:16:07.958 --> 00:16:12.958\nJewish Rabbis, Muslims, Christians -- everybody writing in,\n\n00:16:12.958 --> 00:16:16.958\nunited by their love of life.\n\n00:16:16.958 --> 00:16:22.958\nAnd to me that -- I don't think I could say it any better than the immortal Bard himself:\n\n00:16:22.958 --> 00:16:26.958\n\"One touch of nature makes the whole world kin.\"\n\n00:16:26.958 --> 00:16:30.958\nAnd sure, it may be just one big old silly fish, but it's helping.\n\n00:16:30.958 --> 00:16:34.958\nIf it's helping to unite the world, I think it's definitely the fish of the future."}, {"title": "How PhotoSynth can connect the world's images", "duration": "450", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/blaise_aguera_y_arcas_demos_photosynth", "transcript": "What I'm going to show you first, as quickly as I can, is some foundational work, some new technology that we brought to Microsoft as part of an acquisition almost exactly a year ago. This is Seadragon, and it's an environment in which you can either locally or remotely interact with vast amounts of visual data.We're looking at many, many gigabytes of digital photos here and kind of seamlessly and continuously zooming in, panning through it, rearranging it in any way we want. And it doesn't matter how much information we're looking at, how big these collections are or how big the images are. Most of them are ordinary digital camera photos, but this one, for example, is a scan from the Library of Congress, and it's in the 300 megapixel range. It doesn't make any difference because the only thing that ought to limit the performance of a system like this one is the number of pixels on your screen at any given moment. It's also very flexible architecture. This is an entire book, so this is an example of non-image data. This is \"Bleak House\" by Dickens. Every column is a chapter. To prove to you that it's really text, and not an image, we can do something like so, to really show that this is a real representation of the text; it's not a picture. Maybe this is an artificial way to read an e-book. I wouldn't recommend it.This is a more realistic case, an issue of The Guardian. Every large image is the beginning of a section. And this really gives you the joy and the good experience of reading the real paper version of a magazine or a newspaper, which is an inherently multi-scale kind of medium. We've done something with the corner of this particular issue of The Guardian. We've made up a fake ad that's very high resolution \u2014 much higher than in an ordinary ad \u2014 and we've embedded extra content. If you want to see the features of this car, you can see it here. Or other models, or even technical specifications. And this really gets at some of these ideas about really doing away with those limits on screen real estate. We hope that this means no more pop-ups and other rubbish like that \u2014 shouldn't be necessary.Of course, mapping is one of those obvious applications for a technology like this. And this one I really won't spend any time on, except to say that we have things to contribute to this field as well. But those are all the roads in the U.S. superimposed on top of a NASA geospatial image. So let's pull up, now, something else. This is actually live on the Web now; you can go check it out.This is a project called Photosynth, which marries two different technologies. One of them is Seadragon and the other is some very beautiful computer-vision research done by Noah Snavely, a graduate student at the University of Washington, co-advised by Steve Seitz at U.W. and Rick Szeliski at Microsoft Research. A very nice collaboration. And so this is live on the Web. It's powered by Seadragon. You can see that when we do these sorts of views, where we can dive through images and have this kind of multi-resolution experience.But the spatial arrangement of the images here is actually meaningful. The computer vision algorithms have registered these images together so that they correspond to the real space in which these shots \u2014 all taken near Grassi Lakes in the Canadian Rockies \u2014 all these shots were taken. So you see elements here of stabilized slide-show or panoramic imaging, and these things have all been related spatially. I'm not sure if I have time to show you any other environments. Some are much more spatial. I would like to jump straight to one of Noah's original data-sets \u2014 this is from an early prototype that we first got working this summer \u2014 to show you what I think is really the punch line behind the Photosynth technology, It's not necessarily so apparent from looking at the environments we've put up on the website. We had to worry about the lawyers and so on.This is a reconstruction of Notre Dame Cathedral that was done entirely computationally from images scraped from Flickr. You just type Notre Dame into Flickr, and you get some pictures of guys in T-shirts, and of the campus and so on. And each of these orange cones represents an image that was discovered to belong to this model. And so these are all Flickr images, and they've all been related spatially in this way. We can just navigate in this very simple way.(Applause)(Applause ends)You know, I never thought that I'd end up working at Microsoft. It's very gratifying to have this kind of reception here.(Laughter)I guess you can see this is lots of different types of cameras: it's everything from cell-phone cameras to professional SLRs, quite a large number of them, stitched together in this environment. If I can find some of the sort of weird ones \u2014 So many of them are occluded by faces, and so on. Somewhere in here there is actually a series of photographs \u2014 here we go. This is actually a poster of Notre Dame that registered correctly. We can dive in from the poster to a physical view of this environment.What the point here really is is that we can do things with the social environment. This is now taking data from everybody \u2014 from the entire collective memory, visually, of what the Earth looks like \u2014 and link all of that together. Those photos become linked, and they make something emergent that's greater than the sum of the parts. You have a model that emerges of the entire Earth. Think of this as the long tail to Stephen Lawler's Virtual Earth work. And this is something that grows in complexity as people use it, and whose benefits become greater to the users as they use it. Their own photos are getting tagged with meta-data that somebody else entered. If somebody bothered to tag all of these saints and say who they all are, then my photo of Notre Dame Cathedral suddenly gets enriched with all of that data, and I can use it as an entry point to dive into that space, into that meta-verse, using everybody else's photos, and do a kind of a cross-modal and cross-user social experience that way. And of course, a by-product of all of that is immensely rich virtual models of every interesting part of the Earth, collected not just from overhead flights and from satellite images and so on, but from the collective memory.Thank you so much.(Applause)(Applause ends)Chris Anderson: Do I understand this right? What your software is going to allow, is that at some point, really within the next few years, all the pictures that are shared by anyone across the world are going to link together?BAA: Yes. What this is really doing is discovering, creating hyperlinks, if you will, between images. It's doing that based on the content inside the images. And that gets really exciting when you think about the richness of the semantic information a lot of images have. Like when you do a web search for images, you type in phrases, and the text on the web page is carrying a lot of information about what that picture is of. What if that picture links to all of your pictures? The amount of semantic interconnection and richness that comes out of that is really huge. It's a classic network effect.CA: Truly incredible.

--> 00:02:47.350\ndone by Noah Snavely, a graduate student\nat the University of Washington,\n\n00:02:47.374 --> 00:02:49.203\nco-advised by Steve Seitz at U.W.\n\n00:02:49.227 --> 00:02:51.205\nand Rick Szeliski at Microsoft Research.\n\n00:02:51.229 --> 00:02:52.962\nA very nice collaboration.\n\n00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:56.478\nAnd so this is live on the Web.\nIt's powered by Seadragon.\n\n00:02:56.502 --> 00:02:59.006\nYou can see that\nwhen we do these sorts of views,\n\n00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:00.753\nwhere we can dive through images\n\n00:03:00.777 --> 00:03:03.111\nand have this kind\nof multi-resolution experience.\n\n00:03:03.135 --> 00:03:06.934\nBut the spatial arrangement of the images\nhere is actually meaningful.\n\n00:03:06.958 --> 00:03:10.149\nThe computer vision algorithms\nhave registered these images together\n\n00:03:10.173 --> 00:03:13.934\nso that they correspond to the real\nspace in which these shots --\n\n00:03:13.958 --> 00:03:17.258\nall taken near Grassi Lakes\nin the Canadian Rockies --\n\n00:03:17.282 --> 00:03:18.945\nall these shots were taken.\n\n00:03:18.969 --> 00:03:20.436\nSo you see elements here\n\n00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:26.473\nof stabilized slide-show\nor panoramic imaging,\n\n00:03:26.497 --> 00:03:28.934\nand these things have\nall been related spatially.\n\n00:03:28.958 --> 00:03:31.958\nI'm not sure if I have time\nto show you any other environments.\n\n00:03:31.982 --> 00:03:33.413\nSome are much more spatial.\n\n00:03:33.437 --> 00:03:37.382\nI would like to jump straight\nto one of Noah's original data-sets --\n\n00:03:37.406 --> 00:03:40.958\nthis is from an early prototype\nthat we first got working this summer --\n\n00:03:40.982 --> 00:03:42.876\nto show you what I think\n\n00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:46.738\nis really the punch line\nbehind the Photosynth technology,\n\n00:03:46.762 --> 00:03:48.323\nIt's not necessarily so apparent\n\n00:03:48.347 --> 00:03:51.242\nfrom looking at the environments\nwe've put up on the website.\n\n00:03:51.266 --> 00:03:53.443\nWe had to worry\nabout the lawyers and so on.\n\n00:03:53.467 --> 00:03:55.768\nThis is a reconstruction\nof Notre Dame Cathedral\n\n00:03:55.792 --> 00:03:59.249\nthat was done entirely computationally\nfrom images scraped from Flickr.\n\n00:03:59.273 --> 00:04:01.292\nYou just type Notre Dame into Flickr,\n\n00:04:01.316 --> 00:04:05.170\nand you get some pictures of guys\nin T-shirts, and of the campus and so on.\n\n00:04:05.194 --> 00:04:08.340\nAnd each of these orange cones\nrepresents an image\n\n00:04:08.364 --> 00:04:11.598\nthat was discovered\nto belong to this model.\n\n00:04:12.958 --> 00:04:14.934\nAnd so these are all Flickr images,\n\n00:04:14.958 --> 00:04:17.934\nand they've all been related\nspatially in this way.\n\n00:04:17.958 --> 00:04:20.292\nWe can just navigate\nin this very simple way.\n\n00:04:21.958 --> 00:04:25.878\n(Applause)\n\n00:04:29.515 --> 00:04:30.529\n(Applause ends)\n\n00:04:30.553 --> 00:04:33.507\nYou know, I never thought\nthat I'd end up working at Microsoft.\n\n00:04:33.531 --> 00:04:36.531\nIt's very gratifying to have\nthis kind of reception here.\n\n00:04:36.555 --> 00:04:39.934\n(Laughter)\n\n00:04:39.958 --> 00:04:45.006\nI guess you can see this is\nlots of different types of cameras:\n\n00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:48.191\nit's everything from cell-phone cameras\nto professional SLRs,\n\n00:04:48.215 --> 00:04:51.406\nquite a large number of them,\nstitched together in this environment.\n\n00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:54.062\nIf I can find some\nof the sort of weird ones --\n\n00:04:54.958 --> 00:04:58.280\nSo many of them are occluded\nby faces, and so on.\n\n00:04:59.553 --> 00:05:03.830\nSomewhere in here there is actually\na series of photographs -- here we go.\n\n00:05:03.854 --> 00:05:07.155\nThis is actually a poster of Notre Dame\nthat registered correctly.\n\n00:05:07.179 --> 00:05:10.395\nWe can dive in from the poster\n\n00:05:10.419 --> 00:05:14.229\nto a physical view of this environment.\n\n00:05:18.379 --> 00:05:20.245\nWhat the point here really is\n\n00:05:20.269 --> 00:05:22.860\nis that we can do things\nwith the social environment.\n\n00:05:22.884 --> 00:05:25.886\nThis is now taking data from everybody --\n\n00:05:25.910 --> 00:05:29.781\nfrom the entire collective memory,\nvisually, of what the Earth looks like --\n\n00:05:29.805 --> 00:05:31.554\nand link all of that together.\n\n00:05:31.578 --> 00:05:34.417\nThose photos become linked,\nand they make something emergent\n\n00:05:34.441 --> 00:05:36.394\nthat's greater than the sum of the parts.\n\n00:05:36.418 --> 00:05:38.774\nYou have a model that emerges\nof the entire Earth.\n\n00:05:38.798 --> 00:05:42.875\nThink of this as the long tail\nto Stephen Lawler's Virtual Earth work.\n\n00:05:42.899 --> 00:05:46.099\nAnd this is something that grows\nin complexity as people use it,\n\n00:05:46.123 --> 00:05:49.934\nand whose benefits become greater\nto the users as they use it.\n\n00:05:49.958 --> 00:05:53.650\nTheir own photos are getting tagged\nwith meta-data that somebody else entered.\n\n00:05:53.674 --> 00:05:57.034\nIf somebody bothered\nto tag all of these saints\n\n00:05:57.058 --> 00:06:00.011\nand say who they all are,\nthen my photo of Notre Dame Cathedral\n\n00:06:00.035 --> 00:06:02.133\nsuddenly gets enriched\nwith all of that data,\n\n00:06:02.157 --> 00:06:04.934\nand I can use it as an entry point\nto dive into that space,\n\n00:06:04.958 --> 00:06:07.639\ninto that meta-verse,\nusing everybody else's photos,\n\n00:06:07.663 --> 00:06:10.964\nand do a kind of a cross-modal\n\n00:06:10.988 --> 00:06:14.739\nand cross-user social experience that way.\n\n00:06:14.763 --> 00:06:18.934\nAnd of course, a by-product of all of that\nis immensely rich virtual models\n\n00:06:18.958 --> 00:06:20.926\nof every interesting part of the Earth,\n\n00:06:20.950 --> 00:06:25.437\ncollected not just from overhead flights\nand from satellite images\n\n00:06:25.461 --> 00:06:27.513\nand so on, but from the collective memory.\n\n00:06:27.537 --> 00:06:28.631\nThank you so much.\n\n00:06:28.655 --> 00:06:35.518\n(Applause)\n\n00:06:38.925 --> 00:06:39.926\n(Applause ends)\n\n00:06:39.950 -->

I don't think we're going to make it. Probably by now most of you have seen Al Gore's amazing talk. Shortly after I saw that, we had some friends over for dinner with the family. The conversation turned to global warming, and everybody agreed, there's a real problem. We've got a climate crisis. So, we went around the table to talk about what we should do. The conversation came to my 15-year-old daughter, Mary. She said, \"I agree with everything that's been said. I'm scared and I'm angry.\" And then she turned to me and said, \"Dad, your generation created this problem; you'd better fix it.\" Wow. All the conversation stopped. All the eyes turned to me. (Laughter) I didn't know what to say. Kleiner's second law is, \"There is a time when panic is the appropriate response.\" (Laughter) And we've reached that time. We cannot afford to underestimate this problem. If we face irreversible and catastrophic consequences, we must act, and we must act decisively. I've got to tell you, for me, everything changed that evening.And so, my partners and I, we set off on this mission to learn more, to try to do much more. So, we mobilized. We got on airplanes. We went to Brazil. We went to China and to India, to Bentonville, Arkansas, to Washington, D.C. and to Sacramento. And so, what I'd like to do now is to tell you about what we've learned in those journeys. Because the more we learned, the more concerned we grew. You know, my partners at Kleiner and I were compulsive networkers, and so when we see a big problem or an opportunity like avian flu or personalized medicine, we just get together the smartest people we know. For this climate crisis, we assembled a network, really, of superstars, from policy activists to scientists and entrepreneurs and business leaders. Fifty or so of them. And so, I want to tell you about what we've learned in doing that and four lessons I've learned in the last year.The first lesson is that companies are really powerful, and that matters a lot. This is a story about how Wal-Mart went green, and what that means. Two years ago, the CEO, Lee Scott, believed that green is the next big thing, and so Wal-Mart made going green a top priority. They committed that they're going to take their existing stores and reduce their energy consumption by 20 percent, and their new stores by 30 percent, and do all that in seven years. The three biggest uses of energy in a store are heating and air conditioning, then lighting, and then refrigeration. So, look what they did. They painted the roofs of all their stores white. They put smart skylights through their stores so they could harvest the daylight and reduce the lighting demands. And, third, they put the refrigerated goods behind closed doors with LED lighting. I mean, why would you try to refrigerate a whole store? These are really simple, smart solutions based on existing technology.Why does Wal-Mart matter? Well, it's massive. They're the largest private employer in America. They're the largest private user of electricity. They have the second-largest vehicle fleet on the road. And they have one of the world's most amazing supply chains, 60,000 suppliers. If Wal-Mart were a country, it would be the sixth-largest trading partner with China. And maybe most important, they have a big effect on other companies.When Wal-Mart declares it's going to go green and be profitable, it has a powerful impact on other great institutions. So, let me tell you this: when Wal-Mart achieves 20 percent energy reductions, that's going to be a very big deal. But I'm afraid it's not enough. We need Wal-Mart and every other company to do the same.The second thing that we learned is that individuals matter, and they matter enormously. I've got another Wal-Mart story for you, OK? Wal-Mart has over 125 million U.S. customers. That's a third of the U.S. population. 65 million compact fluorescent light bulbs were sold last year. And Wal-Mart has committed they're going to sell another 100 million light bulbs in the coming year. But it's not easy. Consumers don't really like these light bulbs. The light's kind of funny, they won't dim, takes a while for them to start up. But the pay-off is really enormous. 100 million compact fluorescent light bulbs means that we'll save 600 million dollars in energy bills, and 20 million tons of CO2 every year, year in and year out. It does seem really hard to get consumers to do the right thing. It is stupid that we use two tons of steel, glass and plastic to haul our sorry selves to the shopping mall. It's stupid that we put water in plastic bottles in Fiji and ship it here. (Laughter)It's hard to change consumer behavior because consumers don't know how much this stuff costs. Do you know? Do you know how much CO2 you generated to drive here or fly here? I don't know, and I should. Those of us who care about all this would act better if we knew what the real costs were. But as long as we pretend that CO2 is free, as long as these uses are nearly invisible, how can we expect change? I'm really afraid, because I think the kinds of changes we can reasonably expect from individuals are going to be clearly not enough.The third lesson we learned is that policy matters. It really matters. In fact, policy is paramount. I've got a behind-the-scenes story for you about that green tech network I described. At the end of our first meeting, we got together to talk about what the action items would be, how we'd follow up. And Bob Epstein raised a hand. He stood up. You know, Bob's that Berkeley techie type who started Sybase. Well, Bob said the most important thing we could do right now is to make it clear in Sacramento, California that we need a market-based system of mandates that's going to cap and reduce greenhouse gases in California. It's necessary and, just as important, it's good for the California economy.So, eight of us went to Sacramento in August and we met with the seven undecided legislators and we lobbied for AB32. You know what? Six of those seven voted yes in favor of the bill, so it passed, and it passed by a vote of 47 to 32. (Applause) Please. Thank you. I think it's the most important legislation of 2006. Why? Because California was the first state in this country to mandate 25 percent reduction of greenhouse gases by 2020. And the result of that is, we're going to generate 83,000 new jobs, four billion dollars a year in annual income, and reduce the CO2 emissions by 174 million tons a year. California emits only seven percent of U.S. CO2 emissions. It's only a percent and a half of the country's CO2 emissions. It's a great start, but I've got to tell you \u2014 where I started \u2014 I'm really afraid. In fact, I'm certain California's not enough.Here's a story about national policy that we could all learn from. You know Tom Friedman says, \"If you don't go, you don't know\"? Well, we went to Brazil to meet Dr. Jose Goldemberg. He's the father of the ethanol revolution. He told us that Brazil's government mandated that every gasoline station in the country would carry ethanol. And they mandated that their new vehicles would be flex-fuel compatible, right? They'd run ethanol or ordinary gasoline. And so, here's what's happened in Brazil. They now have 29,000 ethanol pumps \u2014 this versus 700 in the U.S., and a paltry two in California \u2014 and in three years their new car fleet has gone from four percent to 85 percent flex-fuel. Compare that to the U.S.: five percent are flex-fuel. And you know what? Most consumers who have them don't even know it. So, what's happened in Brazil is, they've replaced 40 percent of the gasoline consumed by their automotive fleet with ethanol. That's 59 billion dollars since 1975 that they didn't ship to the Middle East. It's created a million jobs inside that country, and it's saved 32 million tons of CO2. It's really substantial. That's 10 percent of the CO2 emissions across their entire country. But Brazil's only 1.3 percent of the world's CO2 emission. So, Brazil's ethanol miracle, I'm really afraid, is not enough. In fact, I'm afraid all of the best policies we have are not going to be enough.The fourth and final lesson we've learned is about the potential of radical innovation. So, I want to tell you about a tragic problem and a breakthrough technology. Every year a million and a half people die of a completely preventable disease. That's malaria. 6,000 people a day. All for want of two dollars' worth of medications that we can buy at the corner drugstore. Well, two dollars, two dollars is too much for Africa. So, a team of Berkeley researchers with 15 million dollars from the Gates Foundation is engineering, designing a radical new way to make the key ingredient, called artemisinin, and they're going to make that drug 10 times cheaper. And in doing so, they'll save a million lives \u2014 at least a million lives a year. A million lives. Their breakthrough technology is synthetic biology. This leverages millions of years of evolution by redesigning bugs to make really useful products. Now, what you do is, you get inside the microbe, you change its metabolic pathways, and you end up with a living chemical factory.Now, you may ask, John, what has this got to go with green and with climate crisis? Well, I'll tell you \u2014 a lot. We've now formed a company called Amyris, and this technology that they're using can be used to make better biofuels. Don't let me skip over that. Better biofuels are a really big deal. That means we can precisely engineer the molecules in the fuel chain and optimize them along the way. So, if all goes well, they're going to have designer bugs in warm vats that are eating and digesting sugars to excrete better biofuels. I guess that's better living through bugs. Alan Kay is famous for saying the best way to predict the future is to invent it. And, of course, at Kleiner we, kind of, apologize and say the second best way is to finance it. And that's why we're investing 200 million dollars in a wide range of really disruptive new technologies for innovation in green technologies. And we're encouraging others to do it as well. We're talking a lot about this.In 2005, there were 600 million dollars invested in new technologies of the sort you see here. It doubled in 2006 to 1.2 billion dollars. But I'm really afraid we need much, much more. For reference, fact one: Exxon's revenues in 2005 were a billion dollars a day. Do you know, they only invested 0.2 percent of revenues in R&D? Second fact: the President's new budget for renewable energy is barely a billion dollars in total. Less than one day of Exxon's revenues. Third fact: I bet you didn't know that there's enough energy in hot rocks under the country to supply America's energy needs for the next thousand years. And the federal budget calls for a measly 20 million dollars of R&D in geothermal energy. It is almost criminal that we are not investing more in energy research in this country. And I am really afraid that it's absolutely not enough.So, in a year's worth of learning we found a bunch of surprises. Who would have thought that a mass retailer could make money by going green? Who would have thought that a database entrepreneur could transform California with legislation? Who would have thought that the ethanol biofuel miracle would come from a developing country in South America? And who would have thought that scientists trying to cure malaria could come up with breakthroughs in biofuels? And who would have thought that all that is not enough? Not enough to stabilize the climate. Not enough to keep the ice in Greenland from crashing into the ocean. The scientists tell us \u2014 and they're only guessing \u2014 that we've got to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by one half, and do it as fast as possible. Now, we may have the political will to do this in the U.S., but I've got to tell you, we've got only one atmosphere, and so somehow we're going to have to find the political will to do this all around the world. The wild card in this deck is China.To size the problem, China's CO2 emissions today are 3.3 gigatons; the U.S. is 5.8. Business as usual means we'll have 23 gigatons from China by 2050. That's about as much CO2 as there is in the whole world. And if it's business as usual, we're going out of business. When I was in Davos, China's Mayor of Dalian was pressed about their CO2 strategy, and he said the following, \"You know, Americans use seven times the CO2 per capita as Chinese.\" Then he asked, \"Why should China sacrifice our growth so that the West can continue to be profligate and stupid?\" Does anybody here have an answer for him? I don't. We've got to make this economic so that all people and all nations make the right outcome, the profitable outcome, and therefore the likely outcome. Energy's a six-trillion-dollar business worldwide. It is the mother of all markets. You remember that Internet?Well, I'll tell you what. Green technologies \u2014 going green \u2014 is bigger than the Internet. It could be the biggest economic opportunity of the 21st century. Moreover, if we succeed, it's going to be the most important transformation for life on the planet since, as Bill Joy says, we went from methane to oxygen in the atmosphere. Now, here's the hard question, if the trajectory of all the world's companies and individuals and policies and innovation is not going to be enough, what are we going to do? I don't know. Everyone here cares about changing the world and has made a difference in that one way or another.So, our call to action \u2014 my call to you \u2014 is for you to make going green your next big thing, your gig. What can you do? You can personally get carbon neutral. Go to ClimateCrisis.org or CarbonCalculator.com and buy carbon credits. You could join other leaders in mandating, lobbying for mandated cap and trade in U.S. greenhouse gas reductions. There's six bills right now in Congress. Let's get one of them passed.And the most important thing you can do, I think, is to use your personal power and your Rolodex to lead your business, your institution, in going green. Do it like Wal-Mart, get it to go green for its customers and its suppliers and for itself. Really think outside the box. Can you imagine what it would be like if Amazon or eBay or Google or Microsoft or Apple really went green and you caused that to happen? It could be bigger than Wal-Mart. I can't wait to see what we TEDsters do about this crisis. And I really, really hope that we multiply all of our energy, all of our talent and all of our influence to solve this problem. Because if we do, I can look forward to the conversation I'm going to have with my daughter in 20 years.

I don't think we're going to make it.\n\n00:00:18.958 --> 00:00:22.958\nProbably by now most of you have seen Al Gore's amazing talk.\n\n00:00:22.958 --> 00:00:26.958\nShortly after I saw that, we had some friends over for dinner\n\n00:00:26.958 --> 00:00:30.958\nwith the family. The conversation turned to global warming,\n\n00:00:30.958 --> 00:00:34.958\nand everybody agreed, there's a real problem.\n\n00:00:34.958 --> 00:00:36.958\nWe've got a climate crisis.\n\n00:00:36.958 --> 00:00:39.958\nSo, we went around the table to talk about what we should do.\n\n00:00:41.958 --> 00:00:44.958\nThe conversation came to my 15-year-old daughter, Mary.\n\n00:00:46.958 --> 00:00:49.958\nShe said, \"I agree with everything that's been said.\n\n00:00:51.958 --> 00:00:56.958\nI'm scared and I'm angry.\" And then she turned to me and said,\n\n00:00:56.958 --> 00:01:03.958\n\"Dad, your generation created this problem; you'd better fix it.\" Wow.\n\n00:01:04.958 --> 00:01:07.958\nAll the conversation stopped. All the eyes turned to me.\n\n00:01:08.958 --> 00:01:12.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:01:13.958 --> 00:01:18.958\nI didn't know what to say. Kleiner's second law is,\n\n00:01:18.958 --> 00:01:22.958\n\"There is a time when panic is the appropriate response.\"\n\n00:01:22.958 --> 00:01:23.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:01:23.958 --> 00:01:29.958\nAnd we've reached that time. We cannot afford to underestimate\n\n00:01:29.958 --> 00:01:37.958\nthis problem. If we face irreversible and catastrophic consequences,\n\n00:01:37.958 --> 00:01:39.958\nwe must act, and we must act decisively.\n\n00:01:40.958 --> 00:01:44.958\nI've got to tell you, for me, everything changed that evening.\n\n00:01:44.958 --> 00:01:48.958\nAnd so, my partners and I, we set off on this mission to learn more,\n\n00:01:48.958 --> 00:01:52.958\nto try to do much more. So, we mobilized. We got on airplanes.\n\n00:01:52.958 --> 00:01:55.958\nWe went to Brazil. We went to China and to India,\n\n00:01:55.958 --> 00:02:00.958\nto Bentonville, Arkansas, to Washington, D.C. and to Sacramento.\n\n00:02:00.958 --> 00:02:03.958\nAnd so, what I'd like to do now is to tell you\n\n00:02:03.958 --> 00:02:06.958\nabout what we've learned in those journeys.\n\n00:02:06.958 --> 00:02:09.958\nBecause the more we learned, the more concerned we grew.\n\n00:02:09.958 --> 00:02:11.958\nYou know, my partners at Kleiner and I were compulsive networkers,\n\n00:02:11.958 --> 00:02:14.958\nand so when we see a big problem or an opportunity\n\n00:02:14.958 --> 00:02:17.958\nlike avian flu or personalized medicine,\n\n00:02:17.958 --> 00:02:20.958\nwe just get together the smartest people we know.\n\n00:02:20.958 --> 00:02:24.958\nFor this climate crisis, we assembled a network, really,\n\n00:02:24.958 --> 00:02:29.958\nof superstars, from policy activists to scientists and entrepreneurs\n\n00:02:29.958 --> 00:02:31.958\nand business leaders. Fifty or so of them.\n\n00:02:31.958 --> 00:02:35.958\nAnd so, I want to tell you about what we've learned in doing that\n\n00:02:35.958 --> 00:02:38.958\nand four lessons I've learned in the last year.\n\n00:02:38.958 --> 00:02:41.958\nThe first lesson is that companies are really powerful,\n\n00:02:42.958 --> 00:02:45.958\nand that matters a lot. This is a story about\n\n00:02:45.958 --> 00:02:48.958\nhow Wal-Mart went green, and what that means.\n\n00:02:48.958 --> 00:02:53.958\nTwo years ago, the CEO, Lee Scott, believed that green is\n\n00:02:53.958 --> 00:02:58.958\nthe next big thing, and so Wal-Mart made going green a top priority.\n\n00:02:59.958 --> 00:03:01.958\nThey committed that they're going to take their existing stores\n\n00:03:01.958 --> 00:03:04.958\nand reduce their energy consumption by 20 percent,\n\n00:03:04.958 --> 00:03:09.958\nand their new stores by 30 percent, and do all that in seven years.\n\n00:03:10.958 --> 00:03:13.958\nThe three biggest uses of energy in a store are heating\n\n00:03:13.958 --> 00:03:17.958\nand air conditioning, then lighting, and then refrigeration.\n\n00:03:17.958 --> 00:03:19.958\nSo, look what they did.\n\n00:03:19.958 --> 00:03:21.958\nThey painted the roofs of all their stores white.\n\n00:03:22.958 --> 00:03:24.958\nThey put smart skylights through their stores\n\n00:03:24.958 --> 00:03:28.958\nso they could harvest the daylight and reduce the lighting demands.\n\n00:03:28.958 --> 00:03:30.958\nAnd, third, they put the refrigerated goods\n\n00:03:30.958 --> 00:03:32.958\nbehind closed doors with LED lighting.\n\n00:03:33.958 --> 00:03:36.958\nI mean, why would you try to refrigerate a whole store?\n\n00:03:36.958 --> 00:03:40.958\nThese are really simple, smart solutions based on existing technology.\n\n00:03:41.958 --> 00:03:43.958\nWhy does Wal-Mart matter? Well, it's massive.\n\n00:03:44.958 --> 00:03:47.958\nThey're the largest private employer in America.\n\n00:03:47.958 --> 00:03:49.958\nThey're the largest private user of electricity.\n\n00:03:49.958 --> 00:03:53.958\nThey have the second-largest vehicle fleet on the road.\n\n00:03:53.958 --> 00:03:56.958\nAnd they have one of the world's most amazing supply chains,\n\n00:03:56.958 --> 00:03:59.958\n60,000 suppliers. If Wal-Mart were a country,\n\n00:04:00.958 --> 00:04:03.958\nit would be the sixth-largest trading partner with China.\n\n00:04:03.958 --> 00:04:08.958\nAnd maybe most important, they have a big effect on other companies.\n\n00:04:08.958 --> 00:04:13.958\nWhen Wal-Mart declares it's going to go green and be profitable,\n\n00:04:13.958 --> 00:04:16.958\nit has a powerful impact on other great institutions.\n\n00:04:16.958 --> 00:04:17.958\nSo, let me tell you this:\n\n00:04:17.958 --> 00:04:20.958\nwhen Wal-Mart achieves 20 percent energy reductions,\n\n00:04:20.958 --> 00:04:26.958\nthat's going to be a very big deal. But I'm afraid it's not enough.\n\n00:04:26.958 --> 00:04:31.958\nWe need Wal-Mart and every other company to do the same.\n\n00:04:31.958 --> 00:04:34.958\nThe second thing that we learned is that individuals matter,\n\n00:04:34.958 --> 00:04:37.958\nand they matter enormously.\n\n00:04:37.958 --> 00:04:39.958\nI've got another Wal-Mart story for you, OK?\n\n00:04:39.958 --> 00:04:42.958\nWal-Mart has over 125 million U.S. customers.\n\n00:04:42.958 --> 00:04:44.958\nThat's a third of the U.S. population.\n\n00:04:46.958 --> 00:04:50.958\n65 million compact fluorescent light bulbs were sold last year.\n\n00:04:51.958 --> 00:04:54.958\nAnd Wal-Mart has committed they're going to sell\n\n00:04:54.958 --> 00:04:58.958\nanother 100 million light bulbs in the coming year. But it's not easy.\n\n00:04:59.958 --> 00:05:01.958\nConsumers don't really like these light bulbs.\n\n00:05:01.958 --> 00:05:03.958\nThe light's kind of funny, they won't dim,\n\n00:05:03.958 --> 00:05:05.958\ntakes a while for them to start up.\n\n00:05:05.958 --> 00:05:08.958\nBut the pay-off is really enormous.\n\n00:05:08.958 --> 00:05:11.958\n100 million compact fluorescent light bulbs means\n\n00:05:11.958 --> 00:05:15.958\nthat we'll save 600 million dollars in energy bills,\n\n00:05:15.958 --> 00:05:20.958\nand 20 million tons of CO2 every year, year in and year out.\n\n00:05:22.958 --> 00:05:25.958\nIt does seem really hard to get consumers to do the right thing.\n\n00:05:26.958 --> 00:05:31.958\nIt is stupid that we use two tons of steel, glass and plastic\n\n00:05:31.958 --> 00:05:33.958\nto haul our sorry selves to the shopping mall.\n\n00:05:35.958 --> 00:05:38.958\nIt's stupid that we put water in plastic bottles\n\n00:05:38.958 --> 00:05:41.958\nin Fiji and ship it here.\n\n00:05:42.958 --> 00:05:44.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:05:44.958 --> 00:05:46.958\nIt's hard to change consumer behavior\n\n00:05:46.958 --> 00:05:50.958\nbecause consumers don't know how much this stuff costs. Do you know?\n\n00:05:51.958 --> 00:05:55.958\nDo you know how much CO2 you generated to drive here or fly here?\n\n00:05:56.958 --> 00:05:58.958\nI don't know, and I should.\n\n00:05:59.958 --> 00:06:01.958\nThose of us who care about all this would act better\n\n00:06:01.958 --> 00:06:04.958\nif we knew what the real costs were.\n\n00:06:04.958 --> 00:06:07.958\nBut as long as we pretend that CO2 is free,\n\n00:06:07.958 --> 00:06:12.958\nas long as these uses are nearly invisible, how can we expect change?\n\n00:06:12.958 --> 00:06:16.958\nI'm really afraid, because I think the kinds of changes\n\n00:06:16.958 --> 00:06:18.958\nwe can reasonably expect from individuals\n\n00:06:19.958 --> 00:06:22.958\nare going to be clearly not enough.\n\n00:06:24.958 --> 00:06:27.958\nThe third lesson we learned is that policy matters. It really matters.\n\n00:06:27.958 --> 00:06:29.958\nIn fact, policy is paramount.\n\n00:06:30.958 --> 00:06:32.958\nI've got a behind-the-scenes story for you\n\n00:06:32.958 --> 00:06:33.958\nabout that green tech network I described.\n\n00:06:33.958 --> 00:06:36.958\nAt the end of our first meeting, we got together to talk about\n\n00:06:36.958 --> 00:06:39.958\nwhat the action items would be, how we'd follow up.\n\n00:06:40.958 --> 00:06:44.958\nAnd Bob Epstein raised a hand. He stood up.\n\n00:06:44.958 --> 00:06:47.958\nYou know, Bob's that Berkeley techie type who started Sybase.\n\n00:06:47.958 --> 00:06:51.958\nWell, Bob said the most important thing we could do right now\n\n00:06:51.958 --> 00:06:54.958\nis to make it clear in Sacramento, California\n\n00:06:55.958 --> 00:06:58.958\nthat we need a market-based system of mandates\n\n00:06:58.958 --> 00:07:02.958\nthat's going to cap and reduce greenhouse gases in California.\n\n00:07:03.958 --> 00:07:06.958\nIt's necessary and, just as important,\n\n00:07:06.958 --> 00:07:08.958\nit's good for the California economy.\n\n00:07:08.958 --> 00:07:11.958\nSo, eight of us went to Sacramento in August and we met\n\n00:07:11.958 --> 00:07:16.958\nwith the seven undecided legislators and we lobbied for AB32.\n\n00:07:16.958 --> 00:07:19.958\nYou know what? Six of those seven voted yes in favor of the bill,\n\n00:07:19.958 --> 00:07:24.958\nso it passed, and it passed by a vote of 47 to 32.\n\n00:07:25.958 --> 00:07:28.958\n(Applause)\n\n00:07:28.958 --> 00:07:30.958\nPlease. Thank you.\n\n00:07:32.958 --> 00:07:33.958\nI think it's the most important legislation of 2006. Why?\n\n00:07:33.958 --> 00:07:37.958\nBecause California was the first state in this country\n\n00:07:37.958 --> 00:07:41.958\nto mandate 25 percent reduction of greenhouse gases by 2020.\n\n00:07:41.958 --> 00:07:46.958\nAnd the result of that is, we're going to generate 83,000 new jobs,\n\n00:07:46.958 --> 00:07:50.958\nfour billion dollars a year in annual income, and reduce the CO2 emissions\n\n00:07:50.958 --> 00:07:53.958\nby 174 million tons a year.\n\n00:07:55.958 --> 00:08:00.958\nCalifornia emits only seven percent of U.S. CO2 emissions.\n\n00:08:00.958 --> 00:08:03.958\nIt's only a percent and a half of the country's CO2 emissions. It's a great start,\n\n00:08:03.958 --> 00:08:07.958\nbut I've got to tell you -- where I started -- I'm really afraid.\n\n00:08:08.958 --> 00:08:11.958\nIn fact, I'm certain California's not enough.\n\n00:08:12.958 --> 00:08:16.958\nHere's a story about national policy that we could all learn from.\n\n00:08:16.958 --> 00:08:19.958\nYou know Tom Friedman says, \"If you don't go, you don't know\"?\n\n00:08:19.958 --> 00:08:23.958\nWell, we went to Brazil to meet Dr. Jose Goldemberg.\n\n00:08:23.958 --> 00:08:26.958\nHe's the father of the ethanol revolution.\n\n00:08:26.958 --> 00:08:29.958\nHe told us that Brazil's government mandated\n\n00:08:29.958 --> 00:08:33.958\nthat every gasoline station in the country would carry ethanol.\n\n00:08:33.958 --> 00:08:36.958\nAnd they mandated that their new vehicles\n\n00:08:36.958 --> 00:08:38.958\nwould be flex-fuel compatible, right?\n\n00:08:38.958 --> 00:08:41.958\nThey'd run ethanol or ordinary gasoline.\n\n00:08:41.958 --> 00:08:43.958\nAnd so, here's what's happened in Brazil.\n\n00:08:43.958 --> 00:08:46.958\nThey now have 29,000 ethanol pumps --\n\n00:08:46.958 --> 00:08:50.958\nthis versus 700 in the U.S., and a paltry two in California --\n\n00:08:50.958 --> 00:08:52.958\nand in three years their new car fleet\n\n00:08:52.958 --> 00:08:56.958\nhas gone from four percent to 85 percent flex-fuel.\n\n00:08:57.958 --> 00:09:00.958\nCompare that to the U.S.: five percent are flex-fuel.\n\n00:09:00.958 --> 00:09:04.958\nAnd you know what? Most consumers who have them don't even know it.\n\n00:09:05.958 --> 00:09:08.958\nSo, what's happened in Brazil is, they've replaced\n\n00:09:08.958 --> 00:09:12.958\n40 percent of the gasoline consumed by their automotive fleet with ethanol.\n\n00:09:12.958 --> 00:09:16.958\nThat's 59 billion dollars since 1975\n\n00:09:16.958 --> 00:09:18.958\nthat they didn't ship to the Middle East.\n\n00:09:18.958 --> 00:09:21.958\nIt's created a million jobs inside that country,\n\n00:09:21.958 --> 00:09:25.958\nand it's saved 32 million tons of CO2. It's really substantial.\n\n00:09:25.958 --> 00:09:28.958\nThat's 10 percent of the CO2 emissions across their entire country.\n\n00:09:29.958 --> 00:09:33.958\nBut Brazil's only 1.3 percent of the world's CO2 emission.\n\n00:09:33.958 --> 00:09:39.958\nSo, Brazil's ethanol miracle, I'm really afraid, is not enough.\n\n00:09:40.958 --> 00:09:43.958\nIn fact, I'm afraid all of the best policies we have\n\n00:09:43.958 --> 00:09:46.958\nare not going to be enough.\n\n00:09:47.958 --> 00:09:49.958\nThe fourth and final lesson we've learned\n\n00:09:49.958 --> 00:09:51.958\nis about the potential of radical innovation.\n\n00:09:51.958 --> 00:09:53.958\nSo, I want to tell you about a tragic problem\n\n00:09:53.958 --> 00:09:55.958\nand a breakthrough technology.\n\n00:09:55.958 --> 00:09:58.958\nEvery year a million and a half people die of\n\n00:09:58.958 --> 00:10:02.958\na completely preventable disease. That's malaria. 6,000 people a day.\n\n00:10:03.958 --> 00:10:05.958\nAll for want of two dollars' worth of medications\n\n00:10:05.958 --> 00:10:07.958\nthat we can buy at the corner drugstore.\n\n00:10:07.958 --> 00:10:11.958\nWell, two dollars, two dollars is too much for Africa.\n\n00:10:11.958 --> 00:10:15.958\nSo, a team of Berkeley researchers with 15 million dollars\n\n00:10:15.958 --> 00:10:21.958\nfrom the Gates Foundation is engineering, designing a radical new way\n\n00:10:21.958 --> 00:10:24.958\nto make the key ingredient, called artemisinin,\n\n00:10:25.958 --> 00:10:27.958\nand they're going to make that drug 10 times cheaper.\n\n00:10:27.958 --> 00:10:30.958\nAnd in doing so, they'll save a million lives --\n\n00:10:30.958 --> 00:10:32.958\nat least a million lives a year. A million lives.\n\n00:10:33.958 --> 00:10:37.958\nTheir breakthrough technology is synthetic biology.\n\n00:10:37.958 --> 00:10:39.958\nThis leverages millions of years of evolution\n\n00:10:39.958 --> 00:10:42.958\nby redesigning bugs to make really useful products.\n\n00:10:42.958 --> 00:10:45.958\nNow, what you do is, you get inside the microbe,\n\n00:10:45.958 --> 00:10:50.958\nyou change its metabolic pathways, and you end up with a living chemical factory.\n\n00:10:50.958 --> 00:10:52.958\nNow, you may ask,\n\n00:10:52.958 --> 00:10:55.958\nJohn, what has this got to go with green and with climate crisis?\n\n00:10:55.958 --> 00:10:57.958\nWell, I'll tell you -- a lot.\n\n00:10:57.958 --> 00:11:01.958\nWe've now formed a company called Amyris, and this technology\n\n00:11:01.958 --> 00:11:05.958\nthat they're using can be used to make better biofuels.\n\n00:11:05.958 --> 00:11:09.958\nDon't let me skip over that. Better biofuels are a really big deal.\n\n00:11:09.958 --> 00:11:13.958\nThat means we can precisely engineer the molecules in the fuel chain\n\n00:11:13.958 --> 00:11:15.958\nand optimize them along the way.\n\n00:11:16.958 --> 00:11:21.958\nSo, if all goes well, they're going to have designer bugs in warm vats\n\n00:11:21.958 --> 00:11:28.958\nthat are eating and digesting sugars to excrete better biofuels.\n\n00:11:28.958 --> 00:11:31.958\nI guess that's better living through bugs.\n\n00:11:32.958 --> 00:11:34.958\nAlan Kay is famous for saying\n\n00:11:34.958 --> 00:11:36.958\nthe best way to predict the future is to invent it.\n\n00:11:36.958 --> 00:11:39.958\nAnd, of course, at Kleiner we, kind of, apologize and say\n\n00:11:39.958 --> 00:11:41.958\nthe second best way is to finance it.\n\n00:11:41.958 --> 00:11:45.958\nAnd that's why we're investing 200 million dollars\n\n00:11:45.958 --> 00:11:48.958\nin a wide range of really disruptive new technologies\n\n00:11:48.958 --> 00:11:50.958\nfor innovation in green technologies.\n\n00:11:50.958 --> 00:11:52.958\nAnd we're encouraging others to do it as well.\n\n00:11:52.958 --> 00:11:54.958\nWe're talking a lot about this.\n\n00:11:54.958 --> 00:11:59.958\nIn 2005, there were 600 million dollars invested in new technologies\n\n00:11:59.958 --> 00:12:04.958\nof the sort you see here. It doubled in 2006 to 1.2 billion dollars.\n\n00:12:04.958 --> 00:12:09.958\nBut I'm really afraid we need much, much more.\n\n00:12:10.958 --> 00:12:11.958\nFor reference, fact one:\n\n00:12:11.958 --> 00:12:14.958\nExxon's revenues in 2005 were a billion dollars a day.\n\n00:12:14.958 --> 00:12:18.958\nDo you know, they only invested 0.2 percent of revenues in R&amp;D?\n\n00:12:18.958 --> 00:12:22.958\nSecond fact: the President's new budget for renewable energy\n\n00:12:22.958 --> 00:12:24.958\nis barely a billion dollars in total.\n\n00:12:25.958 --> 00:12:27.958\nLess than one day of Exxon's revenues.\n\n00:12:28.958 --> 00:12:31.958\nThird fact: I bet you didn't know that there's enough energy\n\n00:12:31.958 --> 00:12:36.958\nin hot rocks under the country to supply America's energy needs\n\n00:12:36.958 --> 00:12:40.958\nfor the next thousand years. And the federal budget\n\n00:12:40.958 --> 00:12:45.958\ncalls for a measly 20 million dollars of R&amp;D in geothermal energy.\n\n00:12:45.958 --> 00:12:48.958\nIt is almost criminal that we are not investing more\n\n00:12:48.958 --> 00:12:51.958\nin energy research in this country.\n\n00:12:51.958 --> 00:12:56.958\nAnd I am really afraid that it's absolutely not enough.\n\n00:12:56.958 --> 00:12:59.958\nSo, in a year's worth of learning we found a bunch of surprises.\n\n00:12:59.958 --> 00:13:01.958\nWho would have thought that a mass retailer\n\n00:13:01.958 --> 00:13:03.958\ncould make money by going green? Who would have thought that\n\n00:13:03.958 --> 00:13:07.958\na database entrepreneur could transform California with legislation?\n\n00:13:07.958 --> 00:13:11.958\nWho would have thought that the ethanol biofuel miracle\n\n00:13:11.958 --> 00:13:14.958\nwould come from a developing country in South America?\n\n00:13:14.958 --> 00:13:16.958\nAnd who would have thought that scientists\n\n00:13:16.958 --> 00:13:20.958\ntrying to cure malaria could come up with breakthroughs in biofuels?\n\n00:13:21.958 --> 00:13:25.958\nAnd who would have thought that all that is not enough?\n\n00:13:26.958 --> 00:13:28.958\nNot enough to stabilize the climate.\n\n00:13:28.958 --> 00:13:32.958\nNot enough to keep the ice in Greenland from crashing into the ocean.\n\n00:13:32.958 --> 00:13:34.958\nThe scientists tell us -- and they're only guessing --\n\n00:13:34.958 --> 00:13:38.958\nthat we've got to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by one half,\n\n00:13:38.958 --> 00:13:39.958\nand do it as fast as possible.\n\n00:13:39.958 --> 00:13:42.958\nNow, we may have the political will to do this in the U.S.,\n\n00:13:42.958 --> 00:13:45.958\nbut I've got to tell you, we've got only one atmosphere,\n\n00:13:46.958 --> 00:13:48.958\nand so somehow we're going to have to find the political will\n\n00:13:48.958 --> 00:13:55.958\nto do this all around the world. The wild card in this deck is China.\n\n00:13:55.958 --> 00:14:01.958\nTo size the problem, China's CO2 emissions today are 3.3 gigatons;\n\n00:14:01.958 --> 00:14:05.958\nthe U.S. is 5.8. Business as usual means\n\n00:14:05.958 --> 00:14:08.958\nwe'll have 23 gigatons from China by 2050.\n\n00:14:08.958 --> 00:14:11.958\nThat's about as much CO2 as there is in the whole world.\n\n00:14:11.958 --> 00:14:14.958\nAnd if it's business as usual, we're going out of business.\n\n00:14:14.958 --> 00:14:17.958\nWhen I was in Davos, China's Mayor of Dalian was pressed\n\n00:14:17.958 --> 00:14:20.958\nabout their CO2 strategy, and he said the following,\n\n00:14:20.958 --> 00:14:25.958\n\"You know, Americans use seven times the CO2 per capita as Chinese.\"\n\n00:14:25.958 --> 00:14:29.958\nThen he asked, \"Why should China sacrifice our growth\n\n00:14:29.958 --> 00:14:33.958\nso that the West can continue to be profligate and stupid?\"\n\n00:14:33.958 --> 00:14:36.958\nDoes anybody here have an answer for him? I don't.\n\n00:14:38.958 --> 00:14:44.958\nWe've got to make this economic so that all people and all nations\n\n00:14:45.958 --> 00:14:47.958\nmake the right outcome, the profitable outcome,\n\n00:14:47.958 --> 00:14:49.958\nand therefore the likely outcome.\n\n00:14:49.958 --> 00:14:51.958\nEnergy's a six-trillion-dollar business worldwide.\n\n00:14:51.958 --> 00:14:55.958\nIt is the mother of all markets. You remember that Internet?\n\n00:14:55.958 --> 00:14:59.958\nWell, I'll tell you what. Green technologies -- going green --\n\n00:14:59.958 --> 00:15:00.958\nis bigger than the Internet.\n\n00:15:00.958 --> 00:15:04.958\nIt could be the biggest economic opportunity of the 21st century.\n\n00:15:04.958 --> 00:15:06.958\nMoreover, if we succeed, it's going to be\n\n00:15:06.958 --> 00:15:10.958\nthe most important transformation for life on the planet since,\n\n00:15:10.958 --> 00:15:13.958\nas Bill Joy says, we went from methane to oxygen in the atmosphere.\n\n00:15:14.958 --> 00:15:19.958\nNow, here's the hard question, if the trajectory of all the world's\n\n00:15:19.958 --> 00:15:23.958\ncompanies and individuals and policies and innovation\n\n00:15:23.958 --> 00:15:30.958\nis not going to be enough, what are we going to do? I don't know.\n\n00:15:31.958 --> 00:15:34.958\nEveryone here cares about changing the world\n\n00:15:34.958 --> 00:15:36.958\nand has made a difference in that one way or another.\n\n00:15:37.958 --> 00:15:41.958\nSo, our call to action -- my call to you --\n\n00:15:41.958 --> 00:15:47.958\nis for you to make going green your next big thing, your gig.\n\n00:15:48.958 --> 00:15:54.958\nWhat can you do? You can personally get carbon neutral.\n\n00:15:54.958 --> 00:15:58.958\nGo to ClimateCrisis.org or CarbonCalculator.com\n\n00:15:58.958 --> 00:16:03.958\nand buy carbon credits. You could join other leaders in mandating,\n\n00:16:03.958 --> 00:16:08.958\nlobbying for mandated cap and trade in U.S. greenhouse gas reductions.\n\n00:16:08.958 --> 00:16:12.958\nThere's six bills right now in Congress. Let's get one of them passed.\n\n00:16:13.958 --> 00:16:15.958\nAnd the most important thing you can do, I think,\n\n00:16:15.958 --> 00:16:17.958\nis to use your personal power and your Rolodex\n\n00:16:17.958 --> 00:16:21.958\nto lead your business, your institution, in going green.\n\n00:16:21.958 --> 00:16:23.958\nDo it like Wal-Mart, get it to go green\n\n00:16:23.958 --> 00:16:28.958\nfor its customers and its suppliers and for itself.\n\n00:16:28.958 --> 00:16:30.958\nReally think outside the box.\n\n00:16:30.958 --> 00:16:35.958\nCan you imagine what it would be like if Amazon or eBay or Google\n\n00:16:35.958 --> 00:16:40.958\nor Microsoft or Apple really went green and you caused that to happen?\n\n00:16:40.958 --> 00:16:43.958\nIt could be bigger than Wal-Mart.\n\n00:16:45.958 --> 00:16:51.958\nI can't wait to see what we TEDsters do about this crisis.\n\n00:16:51.958 --> 00:16:55.958\nAnd I really, really hope that we multiply all of our energy,\n\n00:16:55.958 --> 00:16:59.958\nall of our talent and all of our influence to solve this problem.\n\n00:17:10.958 --> 00:17:16.958\nBecause if we do, I can look forward\n\n00:17:16.958 --> 00:17:20.958\nto the conversation I'm going to have with my daughter in 20 years.\n\n00:17:20.958 --> 00:17:41.958\n(Applause)"}, {"title": "Want to help Africa? Do business here", "duration": "1213", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/ngozi_okonjo_iweala_on_doing_business_in_africa", "transcript": "Thank you very much, Chris. Everybody who came up here said they were scared. I don't know if I'm scared, but this is my first time of addressing an audience like this. And I don't have any smart technology for you to look at. There are no slides, so you'll just have to be content with me. (Laughter)What I want to do this morning is share with you a couple of stories and talk about a different Africa. Already this morning there were some allusions to the Africa that you hear about all the time: the Africa of HIV/AIDS, the Africa of malaria, the Africa of poverty, the Africa of conflict, and the Africa of disasters.While it is true that those things are going on, there's an Africa that you don't hear about very much. And sometimes I'm puzzled, and I ask myself why. This is the Africa that is changing, that Chris alluded to. This is the Africa of opportunity. This is the Africa where people want to take charge of their own futures and their own destinies. And this is the Africa where people are looking for partnerships to do this. That's what I want to talk about today.And I want to start by telling you a story about that change in Africa. On 15th of September 2005, Mr. Diepreye Alamieyeseigha, a governor of one of the oil-rich states of Nigeria, was arrested by the London Metropolitan Police on a visit to London. He was arrested because there were transfers of eight million dollars that went into some dormant accounts that belonged to him and his family. This arrest occurred because there was cooperation between the London Metropolitan Police and the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission of Nigeria \u2014 led by one of our most able and courageous people: Mr. Nuhu Ribadu. Alamieyeseigha was arraigned in London. Due to some slip-ups, he managed to escape dressed as a woman and ran from London back to Nigeria where, according to our constitution, those in office as governors, president \u2014 as in many countries \u2014 have immunity and cannot be prosecuted. But what happened: people were so outraged by this behavior that it was possible for his state legislature to impeach him and get him out of office.Today, Alams \u2014 as we call him for short \u2014 is in jail. This is a story about the fact that people in Africa are no longer willing to tolerate corruption from their leaders. This is a story about the fact that people want their resources managed properly for their good, and not taken out to places where they'll benefit just a few of the elite. And therefore, when you hear about the corrupt Africa \u2014 corruption all the time \u2014 I want you to know that the people and the governments are trying hard to fight this in some of the countries, and that some successes are emerging.Does it mean the problem is over? The answer is no. There's still a long way to go, but that there's a will there. And that successes are being chalked up on this very important fight. So when you hear about corruption, don't just feel that nothing is being done about this \u2014 that you can't operate in any African country because of the overwhelming corruption. That is not the case. There's a will to fight, and in many countries, that fight is ongoing and is being won. In others, like mine, where there has been a long history of dictatorship in Nigeria, the fight is ongoing and we have a long way to go.But the truth of the matter is that this is going on. The results are showing: independent monitoring by the World Bank and other organizations show that in many instances the trend is downwards in terms of corruption, and governance is improving. A study by the Economic Commission for Africa showed a clear trend upwards in governance in 28 African countries.And let me say just one more thing before I leave this area of governance. That is that people talk about corruption, corruption. All the time when they talk about it you immediately think about Africa. That's the image: African countries. But let me say this: if Alams was able to export eight million dollars into an account in London \u2014 if the other people who had taken money, estimated at 20 to 40 billion now of developing countries' monies sitting abroad in the developed countries \u2014 if they're able to do this, what is that? Is that not corruption? In this country, if you receive stolen goods, are you not prosecuted? So when we talk about this kind of corruption, let us also think about what is happening on the other side of the globe \u2014 where the money's going and what can be done to stop it. I'm working on an initiative now, along with the World Bank, on asset recovery, trying to do what we can to get the monies that have been taken abroad \u2014 developing countries' moneys \u2014 to get that sent back. Because if we can get the 20 billion dollars sitting out there back, it may be far more for some of these countries than all the aid that is being put together. (Applause)The second thing I want to talk about is the will for reform. Africans, after \u2014 they're tired, we're tired of being the subject of everybody's charity and care. We are grateful, but we know that we can take charge of our own destinies if we have the will to reform. And what is happening in many African countries now is a realization that no one can do it but us. We have to do it. We can invite partners who can support us, but we have to start. We have to reform our economies, change our leadership, become more democratic, be more open to change and to information.And this is what we started to do in one of the largest countries on the continent, Nigeria. In fact, if you're not in Nigeria, you're not in Africa. I want to tell you that. (Laughter) One in four sub-Saharan Africans is Nigerian, and it has 140 million dynamic people \u2014 chaotic people \u2014 but very interesting people. You'll never be bored. (Laughter)What we started to do was to realize that we had to take charge and reform ourselves. And with the support of a leader who was willing, at the time, to do the reforms, we put forward a comprehensive reform program, which we developed ourselves. Not the International Monetary Fund. Not the World Bank, where I worked for 21 years and rose to be a vice president. No one can do it for you. You have to do it for yourself.We put together a program that would, one: get the state out of businesses it had nothing \u2014 it had no business being in. The state should not be in the business of producing goods and services because it's inefficient and incompetent. So we decided to privatize many of our enterprises. (Applause) We \u2014 as a result, we decided to liberalize many of our markets. Can you believe that prior to this reform \u2014 which started at the end of 2003, when I left Washington to go and take up the post of Finance Minister \u2014 we had a telecommunications company that was only able to develop 4,500 landlines in its entire 30-year history? (Laughter)Having a telephone in my country was a huge luxury. You couldn't get it. You had to bribe. You had to do everything to get your phone. When President Obasanjo supported and launched the liberalization of the telecommunications sector, we went from 4,500 landlines to 32 million GSM lines, and counting. Nigeria's telecoms market is the second-fastest growing in the world, after China. We are getting investments of about a billion dollars a year in telecoms. And nobody knows, except a few smart people. (Laughter)The smartest one, first to come in, was the MTN company of South Africa. And in the three years that I was Finance Minister, they made an average of 360 million dollars profit per year. 360 million in a market \u2014 in a country that is a poor country, with an average per capita income just under 500 dollars per capita. So the market is there. When they kept this under wraps, but soon others got to know. Nigerians themselves began to develop some wireless telecommunications companies, and three or four others have come in. But there's a huge market out there, and people don't know about it, or they don't want to know. So privatization is one of the things we've done.The other thing we've also done is to manage our finances better. Because nobody's going to help you and support you if you're not managing your own finances well. And Nigeria, with the oil sector, had the reputation of being corrupt and not managing its own public finances well. So what did we try to do? We introduced a fiscal rule that de-linked our budget from the oil price. Before we used to just budget on whatever oil we bring in, because oil is the biggest, most revenue-earning sector in the economy: 70 percent of our revenues come from oil. We de-linked that, and once we did it, we began to budget at a price slightly lower than the oil price and save whatever was above that price. We didn't know we could pull it off; it was very controversial. But what it immediately did was that the volatility that had been present in terms of our economic development \u2014 where, even if oil prices were high, we would grow very fast. When they crashed, we crashed. And we could hardly even pay anything, any salaries, in the economy. That smoothened out. We were able to save, just before I left, 27 billion dollars. Whereas \u2014 and this went to our reserves \u2014 when I arrived in 2003, we had seven billion dollars in reserves. By the time I left, we had gone up to almost 30 billion dollars. And as we speak now, we have about 40 billion dollars in reserves due to proper management of our finances. And that shores up our economy, makes it stable.Our exchange rate that used to fluctuate all the time is now fairly stable and being managed so that business people have a predictability of prices in the economy. We brought inflation down from 28 percent to about 11 percent. And we had GDP grow from an average of 2.3 percent the previous decade to about 6.5 percent now. So all the changes and reforms we were able to make have shown up in results that are measurable in the economy.And what is more important, because we want to get away from oil and diversify \u2014 and there are so many opportunities in this one big country, as in many countries in Africa \u2014 what was remarkable is that much of this growth came not from the oil sector alone, but from non-oil. Agriculture grew at better than eight percent. As telecoms sector grew, housing and construction, and I could go on and on. And this is to illustrate to you that once you get the macro-economy straightened out, the opportunities in various other sectors are enormous.We have opportunities in agriculture, like I said. We have opportunities in solid minerals. We have a lot of minerals that no one has even invested in or explored. And we realized that without the proper legislation to make that possible, that wouldn't happen. So we've now got a mining code that is comparable with some of the best in the world. We have opportunities in housing and real estate. There was nothing in a country of 140 million people \u2014 no shopping malls as you know them here. This was an investment opportunity for someone that excited the imagination of people. And now, we have a situation in which the businesses in this mall are doing four times the turnover that they had projected.So, huge things in construction, real estate, mortgage markets. Financial services: we had 89 banks. Too many not doing their real business. We consolidated them from 89 to 25 banks by requiring that they increase their capital \u2014 share capital. And it went from about 25 million dollars to 150 million dollars. The banks \u2014 these banks are now consolidated, and that strengthening of the banking system has attracted a lot of investment from outside. Barclays Bank of the U.K. is bringing in 500 million. Standard Chartered has brought in 140 million. And I can go on. Dollars, on and on, into the system.We are doing the same with the insurance sector. So in financial services, a great deal of opportunity. In tourism, in many African countries, a great opportunity. And that's what many people know East Africa for: the wildlife, the elephants, and so on. But managing the tourism market in a way that can really benefit the people is very important.So what am I trying to say? I'm trying to tell you that there's a new wave on the continent. A new wave of openness and democratization in which, since 2000, more than two-thirds of African countries have had multi-party democratic elections. Not all of them have been perfect, or will be, but the trend is very clear. I'm trying to tell you that since the past three years, the average rate of growth on the continent has moved from about 2.5 percent to about five percent per annum. This is better than the performance of many OECD countries. So it's clear that things are changing.Conflicts are down on the continent; from about 12 conflicts a decade ago, we are down to three or four conflicts \u2014 one of the most terrible, of course, of which is Darfur. And, you know, you have the neighborhood effect where if something is going on in one part of the continent, it looks like the entire continent is affected. But you should know that this continent is not \u2014 is a continent of many countries, not one country. And if we are down to three or four conflicts, it means that there are plenty of opportunities to invest in stable, growing, exciting economies where there's plenty of opportunity. And I want to just make one point about this investment.The best way to help Africans today is to help them to stand on their own feet. And the best way to do that is by helping create jobs. There's no issue with fighting malaria and putting money in that and saving children's lives. That's not what I'm saying. That is fine. But imagine the impact on a family: if the parents can be employed and make sure that their children go to school, that they can buy the drugs to fight the disease themselves. If we can invest in places where you yourselves make money whilst creating jobs and helping people stand on their own feet, isn't that a wonderful opportunity? Isn't that the way to go? And I want to say that some of the best people to invest in on the continent are the women. (Applause)I have a CD here. I'm sorry that I didn't say anything on time. Otherwise, I would have liked you to have seen this. It says, \"Africa: Open for Business.\" And this is a video that has actually won an award as the best documentary of the year. Understand that the woman who made it is going to be in Tanzania, where they're having the session in June. But it shows you Africans, and particularly African women, who against all odds have developed businesses, some of them world-class.One of the women in this video, Adenike Ogunlesi, making children's clothes \u2014 which she started as a hobby and grew into a business. Mixing African materials, such as we have, with materials from elsewhere. So, she'll make a little pair of dungarees with corduroys, with African material mixed in. Very creative designs, has reached a stage where she even had an order from Wal-Mart. (Laughter) For 10,000 pieces. So that shows you that we have people who are capable of doing.And the women are diligent. They are focused; they work hard. I could go on giving examples: Beatrice Gakuba of Rwanda, who opened up a flower business and is now exporting to the Dutch auction in Amsterdam each morning and is employing 200 other women and men to work with her. However, many of these are starved for capital to expand, because nobody believes outside of our countries that we can do what is necessary. Nobody thinks in terms of a market. Nobody thinks there's opportunity. But I'm standing here saying that those who miss the boat now, will miss it forever.So if you want to be in Africa, think about investing. Think about the Beatrices, think about the Adenikes of this world, who are doing incredible things, that are bringing them into the global economy, whilst at the same time making sure that their fellow men and women are employed, and that the children in those households get educated because their parents are earning adequate income.So I invite you to explore the opportunities. When you go to Tanzania, listen carefully, because I'm sure you will hear of the various openings that there will be for you to get involved in something that will do good for the continent, for the people and for yourselves.Thank you very much.

Everybody who came up here\n\n00:00:19.958 --> 00:00:23.958\nsaid they were scared. I don't know if I'm scared,\n\n00:00:23.958 --> 00:00:27.958\nbut this is my first time of addressing an audience like this.\n\n00:00:27.958 --> 00:00:31.958\nAnd I don't have any smart technology for you to look at.\n\n00:00:31.958 --> 00:00:34.958\nThere are no slides, so you'll just have to be content with me.\n\n00:00:34.958 --> 00:00:37.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:00:37.958 --> 00:00:43.958\nWhat I want to do this morning is share with you a couple of stories\n\n00:00:43.958 --> 00:00:46.958\nand talk about a different Africa.\n\n00:00:46.958 --> 00:00:50.958\nAlready this morning there were some allusions to the Africa\n\n00:00:50.958 --> 00:00:55.958\nthat you hear about all the time: the Africa of HIV/AIDS,\n\n00:00:55.958 --> 00:01:01.958\nthe Africa of malaria, the Africa of poverty, the Africa of conflict,\n\n00:01:01.958 --> 00:01:04.958\nand the Africa of disasters.\n\n00:01:04.958 --> 00:01:08.958\nWhile it is true that those things are going on,\n\n00:01:08.958 --> 00:01:12.958\nthere's an Africa that you don't hear about very much.\n\n00:01:12.958 --> 00:01:16.958\nAnd sometimes I'm puzzled, and I ask myself why.\n\n00:01:16.958 --> 00:01:20.958\nThis is the Africa that is changing, that Chris alluded to.\n\n00:01:20.958 --> 00:01:22.958\nThis is the Africa of opportunity.\n\n00:01:22.958 --> 00:01:25.958\nThis is the Africa where people want to take charge of\n\n00:01:25.958 --> 00:01:27.958\ntheir own futures and their own destinies.\n\n00:01:27.958 --> 00:01:30.958\nAnd this is the Africa where people are looking for partnerships\n\n00:01:30.958 --> 00:01:34.958\nto do this. That's what I want to talk about today.\n\n00:01:34.958 --> 00:01:36.958\nAnd I want to start by telling you\n\n00:01:36.958 --> 00:01:38.958\na story about that change in Africa.\n\n00:01:39.958 --> 00:01:44.958\nOn 15th of September 2005, Mr. Diepreye Alamieyeseigha,\n\n00:01:44.958 --> 00:01:48.958\na governor of one of the oil-rich states of Nigeria,\n\n00:01:48.958 --> 00:01:55.958\nwas arrested by the London Metropolitan Police on a visit to London.\n\n00:01:55.958 --> 00:02:00.958\nHe was arrested because there were transfers of eight million dollars\n\n00:02:00.958 --> 00:02:03.958\nthat went into some dormant accounts\n\n00:02:03.958 --> 00:02:06.958\nthat belonged to him and his family.\n\n00:02:07.958 --> 00:02:09.958\nThis arrest occurred because there was cooperation\n\n00:02:09.958 --> 00:02:12.958\nbetween the London Metropolitan Police\n\n00:02:12.958 --> 00:02:15.958\nand the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission of Nigeria --\n\n00:02:15.958 --> 00:02:22.958\nled by one of our most able and courageous people: Mr. Nuhu Ribadu.\n\n00:02:22.958 --> 00:02:25.958\nAlamieyeseigha was arraigned in London.\n\n00:02:25.958 --> 00:02:29.958\nDue to some slip-ups, he managed to escape dressed as a woman\n\n00:02:29.958 --> 00:02:32.958\nand ran from London back to Nigeria where,\n\n00:02:32.958 --> 00:02:36.958\naccording to our constitution, those in office\n\n00:02:36.958 --> 00:02:38.958\nas governors, president -- as in many countries --\n\n00:02:38.958 --> 00:02:43.958\nhave immunity and cannot be prosecuted. But what happened:\n\n00:02:43.958 --> 00:02:47.958\npeople were so outraged by this behavior that it was possible\n\n00:02:47.958 --> 00:02:53.958\nfor his state legislature to impeach him and get him out of office.\n\n00:02:54.958 --> 00:02:56.958\nToday, Alams -- as we call him for short -- is in jail.\n\n00:02:57.958 --> 00:03:02.958\nThis is a story about the fact that people in Africa\n\n00:03:02.958 --> 00:03:07.958\nare no longer willing to tolerate corruption from their leaders.\n\n00:03:08.958 --> 00:03:13.958\nThis is a story about the fact that people want their resources\n\n00:03:13.958 --> 00:03:18.958\nmanaged properly for their good, and not taken out to places\n\n00:03:18.958 --> 00:03:21.958\nwhere they'll benefit just a few of the elite.\n\n00:03:21.958 --> 00:03:25.958\nAnd therefore, when you hear about the corrupt Africa --\n\n00:03:25.958 --> 00:03:29.958\ncorruption all the time -- I want you to know that the people\n\n00:03:29.958 --> 00:03:32.958\nand the governments are trying hard to fight this\n\n00:03:32.958 --> 00:03:36.958\nin some of the countries, and that some successes are emerging.\n\n00:03:36.958 --> 00:03:39.958\nDoes it mean the problem is over? The answer is no.\n\n00:03:39.958 --> 00:03:43.958\nThere's still a long way to go, but that there's a will there.\n\n00:03:43.958 --> 00:03:47.958\nAnd that successes are being chalked up on this very important fight.\n\n00:03:47.958 --> 00:03:49.958\nSo when you hear about corruption,\n\n00:03:49.958 --> 00:03:52.958\ndon't just feel that nothing is being done about this --\n\n00:03:52.958 --> 00:03:55.958\nthat you can't operate in any African country\n\n00:03:55.958 --> 00:03:58.958\nbecause of the overwhelming corruption. That is not the case.\n\n00:03:58.958 --> 00:04:04.958\nThere's a will to fight, and in many countries, that fight is ongoing\n\n00:04:04.958 --> 00:04:08.958\nand is being won. In others, like mine,\n\n00:04:08.958 --> 00:04:11.958\nwhere there has been a long history of dictatorship in Nigeria,\n\n00:04:11.958 --> 00:04:15.958\nthe fight is ongoing and we have a long way to go.\n\n00:04:15.958 --> 00:04:19.958\nBut the truth of the matter is that this is going on.\n\n00:04:20.958 --> 00:04:22.958\nThe results are showing:\n\n00:04:22.958 --> 00:04:26.958\nindependent monitoring by the World Bank and other organizations\n\n00:04:26.958 --> 00:04:30.958\nshow that in many instances the trend is downwards\n\n00:04:30.958 --> 00:04:33.958\nin terms of corruption, and governance is improving.\n\n00:04:33.958 --> 00:04:37.958\nA study by the Economic Commission for Africa showed\n\n00:04:37.958 --> 00:04:41.958\na clear trend upwards in governance in 28 African countries.\n\n00:04:41.958 --> 00:04:43.958\nAnd let me say just one more thing\n\n00:04:43.958 --> 00:04:45.958\nbefore I leave this area of governance.\n\n00:04:45.958 --> 00:04:48.958\nThat is that people talk about corruption, corruption.\n\n00:04:48.958 --> 00:04:50.958\nAll the time when they talk about it\n\n00:04:50.958 --> 00:04:52.958\nyou immediately think about Africa.\n\n00:04:52.958 --> 00:04:56.958\nThat's the image: African countries. But let me say this:\n\n00:04:56.958 --> 00:05:02.958\nif Alams was able to export eight million dollars into an account in London --\n\n00:05:04.958 --> 00:05:08.958\nif the other people who had taken money, estimated at\n\n00:05:08.958 --> 00:05:12.958\n20 to 40 billion now of developing countries' monies\n\n00:05:12.958 --> 00:05:15.958\nsitting abroad in the developed countries -- if they're able to do this,\n\n00:05:15.958 --> 00:05:18.958\nwhat is that? Is that not corruption?\n\n00:05:19.958 --> 00:05:23.958\nIn this country, if you receive stolen goods, are you not prosecuted?\n\n00:05:24.958 --> 00:05:27.958\nSo when we talk about this kind of corruption, let us also think\n\n00:05:27.958 --> 00:05:30.958\nabout what is happening on the other side of the globe --\n\n00:05:30.958 --> 00:05:34.958\nwhere the money's going and what can be done to stop it.\n\n00:05:34.958 --> 00:05:37.958\nI'm working on an initiative now, along with the World Bank,\n\n00:05:37.958 --> 00:05:40.958\non asset recovery, trying to do what we can\n\n00:05:40.958 --> 00:05:43.958\nto get the monies that have been taken abroad --\n\n00:05:43.958 --> 00:05:46.958\ndeveloping countries' moneys -- to get that sent back.\n\n00:05:46.958 --> 00:05:49.958\nBecause if we can get the 20 billion dollars sitting out there back,\n\n00:05:49.958 --> 00:05:52.958\nit may be far more for some of these countries\n\n00:05:52.958 --> 00:05:55.958\nthan all the aid that is being put together.\n\n00:05:55.958 --> 00:06:02.958\n(Applause)\n\n00:06:02.958 --> 00:06:06.958\nThe second thing I want to talk about is the will for reform.\n\n00:06:06.958 --> 00:06:10.958\nAfricans, after -- they're tired, we're tired\n\n00:06:10.958 --> 00:06:15.958\nof being the subject of everybody's charity and care.\n\n00:06:15.958 --> 00:06:19.958\nWe are grateful, but we know that\n\n00:06:19.958 --> 00:06:23.958\nwe can take charge of our own destinies if we have the will to reform.\n\n00:06:24.958 --> 00:06:28.958\nAnd what is happening in many African countries now is a realization\n\n00:06:28.958 --> 00:06:32.958\nthat no one can do it but us. We have to do it.\n\n00:06:32.958 --> 00:06:36.958\nWe can invite partners who can support us, but we have to start.\n\n00:06:36.958 --> 00:06:39.958\nWe have to reform our economies, change our leadership,\n\n00:06:39.958 --> 00:06:45.958\nbecome more democratic, be more open to change and to information.\n\n00:06:45.958 --> 00:06:47.958\nAnd this is what we started to do\n\n00:06:47.958 --> 00:06:50.958\nin one of the largest countries on the continent, Nigeria.\n\n00:06:50.958 --> 00:06:53.958\nIn fact, if you're not in Nigeria, you're not in Africa.\n\n00:06:53.958 --> 00:06:54.958\nI want to tell you that.\n\n00:06:54.958 --> 00:06:55.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:06:55.958 --> 00:06:57.958\nOne in four sub-Saharan Africans is Nigerian,\n\n00:06:59.958 --> 00:07:04.958\nand it has 140 million dynamic people -- chaotic people --\n\n00:07:05.958 --> 00:07:09.958\nbut very interesting people. You'll never be bored.\n\n00:07:09.958 --> 00:07:10.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:07:10.958 --> 00:07:12.958\nWhat we started to do was to realize\n\n00:07:12.958 --> 00:07:14.958\nthat we had to take charge and reform ourselves.\n\n00:07:15.958 --> 00:07:17.958\nAnd with the support of a leader\n\n00:07:17.958 --> 00:07:20.958\nwho was willing, at the time, to do the reforms,\n\n00:07:20.958 --> 00:07:22.958\nwe put forward a comprehensive reform program,\n\n00:07:22.958 --> 00:07:24.958\nwhich we developed ourselves.\n\n00:07:24.958 --> 00:07:27.958\nNot the International Monetary Fund. Not the World Bank,\n\n00:07:27.958 --> 00:07:30.958\nwhere I worked for 21 years and rose to be a vice president.\n\n00:07:31.958 --> 00:07:33.958\nNo one can do it for you. You have to do it for yourself.\n\n00:07:33.958 --> 00:07:37.958\nWe put together a program that would, one: get the state\n\n00:07:37.958 --> 00:07:41.958\nout of businesses it had nothing -- it had no business being in.\n\n00:07:41.958 --> 00:07:43.958\nThe state should not be in the business\n\n00:07:43.958 --> 00:07:44.958\nof producing goods and services\n\n00:07:44.958 --> 00:07:47.958\nbecause it's inefficient and incompetent.\n\n00:07:47.958 --> 00:07:51.958\nSo we decided to privatize many of our enterprises.\n\n00:07:51.958 --> 00:07:55.958\n(Applause)\n\n00:07:56.958 --> 00:08:00.958\nWe -- as a result, we decided to liberalize many of our markets.\n\n00:08:00.958 --> 00:08:03.958\nCan you believe that prior to this reform --\n\n00:08:03.958 --> 00:08:07.958\nwhich started at the end of 2003, when I left Washington\n\n00:08:07.958 --> 00:08:09.958\nto go and take up the post of Finance Minister --\n\n00:08:11.958 --> 00:08:15.958\nwe had a telecommunications company that was only able to develop\n\n00:08:15.958 --> 00:08:20.958\n4,500 landlines in its entire 30-year history?\n\n00:08:20.958 --> 00:08:22.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:08:22.958 --> 00:08:25.958\nHaving a telephone in my country was a huge luxury.\n\n00:08:25.958 --> 00:08:27.958\nYou couldn't get it. You had to bribe.\n\n00:08:27.958 --> 00:08:29.958\nYou had to do everything to get your phone.\n\n00:08:29.958 --> 00:08:32.958\nWhen President Obasanjo supported and launched\n\n00:08:32.958 --> 00:08:36.958\nthe liberalization of the telecommunications sector,\n\n00:08:37.958 --> 00:08:45.958\nwe went from 4,500 landlines to 32 million GSM lines, and counting.\n\n00:08:45.958 --> 00:08:50.958\nNigeria's telecoms market is the second-fastest growing in the world,\n\n00:08:50.958 --> 00:08:55.958\nafter China. We are getting investments of about a billion dollars a year\n\n00:08:55.958 --> 00:09:01.958\nin telecoms. And nobody knows, except a few smart people.\n\n00:09:01.958 --> 00:09:04.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:09:04.958 --> 00:09:08.958\nThe smartest one, first to come in,\n\n00:09:08.958 --> 00:09:10.958\nwas the MTN company of South Africa.\n\n00:09:10.958 --> 00:09:14.958\nAnd in the three years that I was Finance Minister,\n\n00:09:14.958 --> 00:09:17.958\nthey made an average of 360 million dollars profit per year.\n\n00:09:19.958 --> 00:09:25.958\n360 million in a market -- in a country that is a poor country,\n\n00:09:25.958 --> 00:09:29.958\nwith an average per capita income just under 500 dollars per capita.\n\n00:09:30.958 --> 00:09:32.958\nSo the market is there.\n\n00:09:32.958 --> 00:09:35.958\nWhen they kept this under wraps, but soon others got to know.\n\n00:09:36.958 --> 00:09:39.958\nNigerians themselves began to develop\n\n00:09:39.958 --> 00:09:41.958\nsome wireless telecommunications companies,\n\n00:09:41.958 --> 00:09:43.958\nand three or four others have come in.\n\n00:09:43.958 --> 00:09:46.958\nBut there's a huge market out there,\n\n00:09:46.958 --> 00:09:49.958\nand people don't know about it, or they don't want to know.\n\n00:09:51.958 --> 00:09:53.958\nSo privatization is one of the things we've done.\n\n00:09:54.958 --> 00:10:00.958\nThe other thing we've also done is to manage our finances better.\n\n00:10:01.958 --> 00:10:03.958\nBecause nobody's going to help you and support you\n\n00:10:04.958 --> 00:10:07.958\nif you're not managing your own finances well.\n\n00:10:07.958 --> 00:10:11.958\nAnd Nigeria, with the oil sector, had the reputation\n\n00:10:11.958 --> 00:10:16.958\nof being corrupt and not managing its own public finances well.\n\n00:10:16.958 --> 00:10:20.958\nSo what did we try to do? We introduced a fiscal rule\n\n00:10:21.958 --> 00:10:23.958\nthat de-linked our budget from the oil price.\n\n00:10:23.958 --> 00:10:27.958\nBefore we used to just budget on whatever oil we bring in,\n\n00:10:27.958 --> 00:10:32.958\nbecause oil is the biggest, most revenue-earning sector\n\n00:10:32.958 --> 00:10:35.958\nin the economy: 70 percent of our revenues come from oil.\n\n00:10:35.958 --> 00:10:39.958\nWe de-linked that, and once we did it, we began to budget\n\n00:10:39.958 --> 00:10:42.958\nat a price slightly lower than the oil price\n\n00:10:42.958 --> 00:10:46.958\nand save whatever was above that price.\n\n00:10:47.958 --> 00:10:50.958\nWe didn't know we could pull it off; it was very controversial.\n\n00:10:50.958 --> 00:10:53.958\nBut what it immediately did was that the volatility\n\n00:10:53.958 --> 00:10:56.958\nthat had been present in terms of our economic development --\n\n00:10:56.958 --> 00:11:00.958\nwhere, even if oil prices were high, we would grow very fast.\n\n00:11:00.958 --> 00:11:02.958\nWhen they crashed, we crashed.\n\n00:11:02.958 --> 00:11:06.958\nAnd we could hardly even pay anything, any salaries, in the economy.\n\n00:11:07.958 --> 00:11:11.958\nThat smoothened out. We were able to save, just before I left,\n\n00:11:11.958 --> 00:11:17.958\n27 billion dollars. Whereas -- and this went to our reserves --\n\n00:11:17.958 --> 00:11:21.958\nwhen I arrived in 2003, we had seven billion dollars in reserves.\n\n00:11:22.958 --> 00:11:25.958\nBy the time I left, we had gone up to almost 30 billion dollars. And\n\n00:11:25.958 --> 00:11:28.958\nas we speak now, we have about 40 billion dollars in reserves\n\n00:11:29.958 --> 00:11:33.958\ndue to proper management of our finances.\n\n00:11:34.958 --> 00:11:37.958\nAnd that shores up our economy, makes it stable.\n\n00:11:37.958 --> 00:11:40.958\nOur exchange rate that used to fluctuate all the time\n\n00:11:40.958 --> 00:11:44.958\nis now fairly stable and being managed so that business people\n\n00:11:44.958 --> 00:11:49.958\nhave a predictability of prices in the economy.\n\n00:11:51.958 --> 00:11:55.958\nWe brought inflation down from 28 percent to about 11 percent.\n\n00:11:57.958 --> 00:12:03.958\nAnd we had GDP grow from an average of 2.3 percent the previous decade\n\n00:12:03.958 --> 00:12:06.958\nto about 6.5 percent now.\n\n00:12:07.958 --> 00:12:10.958\nSo all the changes and reforms we were able to make\n\n00:12:10.958 --> 00:12:13.958\nhave shown up in results that are measurable in the economy.\n\n00:12:13.958 --> 00:12:17.958\nAnd what is more important, because we want to get away from oil\n\n00:12:17.958 --> 00:12:19.958\nand diversify -- and there are so many opportunities\n\n00:12:19.958 --> 00:12:22.958\nin this one big country, as in many countries in Africa --\n\n00:12:24.958 --> 00:12:27.958\nwhat was remarkable is that much of this growth came\n\n00:12:27.958 --> 00:12:30.958\nnot from the oil sector alone, but from non-oil.\n\n00:12:30.958 --> 00:12:33.958\nAgriculture grew at better than eight percent.\n\n00:12:33.958 --> 00:12:37.958\nAs telecoms sector grew, housing and construction,\n\n00:12:37.958 --> 00:12:42.958\nand I could go on and on. And this is to illustrate to you that\n\n00:12:42.958 --> 00:12:44.958\nonce you get the macro-economy straightened out,\n\n00:12:44.958 --> 00:12:48.958\nthe opportunities in various other sectors are enormous.\n\n00:12:49.958 --> 00:12:52.958\nWe have opportunities in agriculture, like I said.\n\n00:12:52.958 --> 00:12:56.958\nWe have opportunities in solid minerals. We have a lot of minerals\n\n00:12:56.958 --> 00:12:59.958\nthat no one has even invested in or explored. And we realized\n\n00:12:59.958 --> 00:13:02.958\nthat without the proper legislation to make that possible,\n\n00:13:02.958 --> 00:13:05.958\nthat wouldn't happen. So we've now got a mining code\n\n00:13:05.958 --> 00:13:08.958\nthat is comparable with some of the best in the world.\n\n00:13:09.958 --> 00:13:11.958\nWe have opportunities in housing and real estate.\n\n00:13:11.958 --> 00:13:14.958\nThere was nothing in a country of 140 million people --\n\n00:13:15.958 --> 00:13:20.958\nno shopping malls as you know them here.\n\n00:13:21.958 --> 00:13:24.958\nThis was an investment opportunity for someone\n\n00:13:24.958 --> 00:13:26.958\nthat excited the imagination of people.\n\n00:13:27.958 --> 00:13:30.958\nAnd now, we have a situation in which the businesses in this mall\n\n00:13:30.958 --> 00:13:33.958\nare doing four times the turnover that they had projected.\n\n00:13:34.958 --> 00:13:37.958\nSo, huge things in construction, real estate,\n\n00:13:37.958 --> 00:13:39.958\nmortgage markets. Financial services:\n\n00:13:40.958 --> 00:13:44.958\nwe had 89 banks. Too many not doing their real business.\n\n00:13:44.958 --> 00:13:48.958\nWe consolidated them from 89 to 25 banks by requiring\n\n00:13:48.958 --> 00:13:53.958\nthat they increase their capital -- share capital.\n\n00:13:53.958 --> 00:13:58.958\nAnd it went from about 25 million dollars to 150 million dollars.\n\n00:13:58.958 --> 00:14:02.958\nThe banks -- these banks are now consolidated, and that strengthening\n\n00:14:02.958 --> 00:14:06.958\nof the banking system has attracted a lot of investment from outside.\n\n00:14:06.958 --> 00:14:10.958\nBarclays Bank of the U.K. is bringing in 500 million.\n\n00:14:10.958 --> 00:14:14.958\nStandard Chartered has brought in 140 million.\n\n00:14:14.958 --> 00:14:17.958\nAnd I can go on. Dollars, on and on, into the system.\n\n00:14:17.958 --> 00:14:19.958\nWe are doing the same with the insurance sector.\n\n00:14:19.958 --> 00:14:22.958\nSo in financial services, a great deal of opportunity.\n\n00:14:22.958 --> 00:14:28.958\nIn tourism, in many African countries, a great opportunity.\n\n00:14:28.958 --> 00:14:31.958\nAnd that's what many people know East Africa for:\n\n00:14:32.958 --> 00:14:35.958\nthe wildlife, the elephants, and so on.\n\n00:14:35.958 --> 00:14:37.958\nBut managing the tourism market in a way\n\n00:14:37.958 --> 00:14:40.958\nthat can really benefit the people is very important.\n\n00:14:41.958 --> 00:14:44.958\nSo what am I trying to say? I'm trying to tell you\n\n00:14:44.958 --> 00:14:47.958\nthat there's a new wave on the continent.\n\n00:14:47.958 --> 00:14:52.958\nA new wave of openness and democratization in which, since 2000,\n\n00:14:52.958 --> 00:14:54.958\nmore than two-thirds of African countries have had\n\n00:14:54.958 --> 00:14:56.958\nmulti-party democratic elections.\n\n00:14:57.958 --> 00:15:00.958\nNot all of them have been perfect, or will be,\n\n00:15:00.958 --> 00:15:02.958\nbut the trend is very clear.\n\n00:15:02.958 --> 00:15:06.958\nI'm trying to tell you that since the past three years,\n\n00:15:06.958 --> 00:15:09.958\nthe average rate of growth on the continent has moved\n\n00:15:09.958 --> 00:15:13.958\nfrom about 2.5 percent to about five percent per annum.\n\n00:15:13.958 --> 00:15:17.958\nThis is better than the performance of many OECD countries.\n\n00:15:18.958 --> 00:15:22.958\nSo it's clear that things are changing.\n\n00:15:22.958 --> 00:15:24.958\nConflicts are down on the continent;\n\n00:15:25.958 --> 00:15:27.958\nfrom about 12 conflicts a decade ago,\n\n00:15:27.958 --> 00:15:29.958\nwe are down to three or four conflicts --\n\n00:15:29.958 --> 00:15:32.958\none of the most terrible, of course, of which is Darfur.\n\n00:15:32.958 --> 00:15:35.958\nAnd, you know, you have the neighborhood effect where\n\n00:15:35.958 --> 00:15:37.958\nif something is going on in one part of the continent,\n\n00:15:37.958 --> 00:15:40.958\nit looks like the entire continent is affected.\n\n00:15:40.958 --> 00:15:43.958\nBut you should know that this continent is not --\n\n00:15:43.958 --> 00:15:49.958\nis a continent of many countries, not one country.\n\n00:15:49.958 --> 00:15:51.958\nAnd if we are down to three or four conflicts,\n\n00:15:51.958 --> 00:15:54.958\nit means that there are plenty of opportunities to invest\n\n00:15:54.958 --> 00:16:01.958\nin stable, growing, exciting economies\n\n00:16:01.958 --> 00:16:04.958\nwhere there's plenty of opportunity.\n\n00:16:05.958 --> 00:16:09.958\nAnd I want to just make one point about this investment.\n\n00:16:10.958 --> 00:16:12.958\nThe best way to help Africans today\n\n00:16:13.958 --> 00:16:16.958\nis to help them to stand on their own feet.\n\n00:16:16.958 --> 00:16:20.958\nAnd the best way to do that is by helping create jobs.\n\n00:16:21.958 --> 00:16:25.958\nThere's no issue with fighting malaria and putting money in that\n\n00:16:25.958 --> 00:16:29.958\nand saving children's lives. That's not what I'm saying. That is fine.\n\n00:16:30.958 --> 00:16:34.958\nBut imagine the impact on a family: if the parents can be employed\n\n00:16:34.958 --> 00:16:36.958\nand make sure that their children go to school,\n\n00:16:36.958 --> 00:16:39.958\nthat they can buy the drugs to fight the disease themselves.\n\n00:16:39.958 --> 00:16:43.958\nIf we can invest in places where you yourselves make money\n\n00:16:43.958 --> 00:16:48.958\nwhilst creating jobs and helping people stand on their own feet,\n\n00:16:48.958 --> 00:16:53.958\nisn't that a wonderful opportunity? Isn't that the way to go?\n\n00:16:53.958 --> 00:16:56.958\nAnd I want to say that some of the best people to invest in\n\n00:16:56.958 --> 00:16:58.958\non the continent are the women.\n\n00:16:59.958 --> 00:17:06.958\n(Applause)\n\n00:17:06.958 --> 00:17:11.958\nI have a CD here. I'm sorry that I didn't say anything on time.\n\n00:17:11.958 --> 00:17:13.958\nOtherwise, I would have liked you to have seen this.\n\n00:17:13.958 --> 00:17:16.958\nIt says, \"Africa: Open for Business.\"\n\n00:17:17.958 --> 00:17:20.958\nAnd this is a video that has actually won an award\n\n00:17:20.958 --> 00:17:22.958\nas the best documentary of the year.\n\n00:17:22.958 --> 00:17:24.958\nUnderstand that the woman who made it\n\n00:17:24.958 --> 00:17:29.958\nis going to be in Tanzania, where they're having the session in June.\n\n00:17:30.958 --> 00:17:35.958\nBut it shows you Africans, and particularly African women, who\n\n00:17:35.958 --> 00:17:40.958\nagainst all odds have developed businesses, some of them world-class.\n\n00:17:40.958 --> 00:17:43.958\nOne of the women in this video, Adenike Ogunlesi,\n\n00:17:43.958 --> 00:17:45.958\nmaking children's clothes --\n\n00:17:45.958 --> 00:17:50.958\nwhich she started as a hobby and grew into a business.\n\n00:17:50.958 --> 00:17:53.958\nMixing African materials, such as we have,\n\n00:17:54.958 --> 00:17:55.958\nwith materials from elsewhere.\n\n00:17:55.958 --> 00:18:00.958\nSo, she'll make a little pair of dungarees with corduroys,\n\n00:18:00.958 --> 00:18:04.958\nwith African material mixed in. Very creative designs,\n\n00:18:06.958 --> 00:18:09.958\nhas reached a stage where she even had an order from Wal-Mart.\n\n00:18:10.958 --> 00:18:11.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:18:12.958 --> 00:18:14.958\nFor 10,000 pieces.\n\n00:18:15.958 --> 00:18:19.958\nSo that shows you that we have people who are capable of doing.\n\n00:18:19.958 --> 00:18:24.958\nAnd the women are diligent. They are focused; they work hard.\n\n00:18:24.958 --> 00:18:26.958\nI could go on giving examples:\n\n00:18:26.958 --> 00:18:30.958\nBeatrice Gakuba of Rwanda, who opened up a flower business\n\n00:18:30.958 --> 00:18:35.958\nand is now exporting to the Dutch auction in Amsterdam each morning\n\n00:18:35.958 --> 00:18:39.958\nand is employing 200 other women and men to work with her.\n\n00:18:40.958 --> 00:18:44.958\nHowever, many of these are starved for capital to expand,\n\n00:18:45.958 --> 00:18:48.958\nbecause nobody believes outside of our countries\n\n00:18:48.958 --> 00:18:53.958\nthat we can do what is necessary. Nobody thinks in terms of a market.\n\n00:18:53.958 --> 00:18:56.958\nNobody thinks there's opportunity.\n\n00:18:56.958 --> 00:18:59.958\nBut I'm standing here saying that those who miss the boat now,\n\n00:18:59.958 --> 00:19:01.958\nwill miss it forever.\n\n00:19:01.958 --> 00:19:07.958\nSo if you want to be in Africa, think about investing.\n\n00:19:08.958 --> 00:19:14.958\nThink about the Beatrices, think about the Adenikes of this world,\n\n00:19:14.958 --> 00:19:17.958\nwho are doing incredible things, that are bringing them\n\n00:19:17.958 --> 00:19:20.958\ninto the global economy, whilst at the same time making sure\n\n00:19:20.958 --> 00:19:23.958\nthat their fellow men and women are employed,\n\n00:19:23.958 --> 00:19:25.958\nand that the children in those households get educated\n\n00:19:25.958 --> 00:19:28.958\nbecause their parents are earning adequate income.\n\n00:19:29.958 --> 00:19:33.958\nSo I invite you to explore the opportunities.\n\n00:19:34.958 --> 00:19:38.958\nWhen you go to Tanzania, listen carefully,\n\n00:19:38.958 --> 00:19:42.958\nbecause I'm sure you will hear of the various openings that there will be\n\n00:19:42.958 --> 00:19:47.958\nfor you to get involved in something that will do good\n\n00:19:47.958 --> 00:19:52.958\nfor the continent, for the people and for yourselves.\n\n00:19:52.958 --> 00:19:53.958\nThank you very much.\n\n00:19:53.958 --> 00:20:01.958\n(Applause)"}, {"title": "Rethink the desktop with BumpTop", "duration": "279", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/anand_agarawala_demos_his_bumptop_desktop", "transcript": "So, I kind of believe that we're in like the \"cave-painting\" era of computer interfaces. Like, they're very kind of \u2014 they don't go as deep or as emotionally engaging as they possibly could be and I'd like to change all that. Hit me. OK. So I mean, this is the kind of status quo interface, right? It's very flat, kind of rigid. And OK, so you could sex it up and like go to a much more lickable Mac, you know, but really it's the kind of same old crap we've had for the last, you know, 30 years. (Laughter) (Applause) Like I think we really put up with a lot of crap with our computers. I mean it's point and click, it's like the menus, icons, it's all the kind of same thing.And so one kind of information space that I take inspiration from is my real desk. It's so much more subtle, so much more visceral \u2014 you know, what's visible, what's not. And I'd like to bring that experience to the desktop. So I kind of have a \u2014 this is BumpTop. It's kind of like a new approach to desktop computing. So you can bump things \u2014 they're all physically, you know, manipulable and stuff. And instead of that point and click, it's like a push and pull, things collide as you'd expect them. Just like on my real desk, I can \u2014 let me just grab these guys \u2014 I can turn things into piles instead of just the folders that we have. And once things are in a pile I can browse them by throwing them into a grid, or you know, flip through them like a book or I can lay them out like a deck of cards. When they're laid out, I can pull things to new locations or delete things or just quickly sort a whole pile, you know, just immediately, right? And then, it's all smoothly animated, instead of these jarring changes you see in today's interfaces.Also, if I want to add something to a pile, well, how do I do that? I just toss it to the pile, and it's added right to the top. It's a kind of nice way. Also some of the stuff we can do is, for these individual icons we thought \u2014 I mean, how can we play with the idea of an icon, and push that further? And one of the things I can do is make it bigger if I want to emphasize it and make it more important.But what's really cool is that since there's a physics simulation running under this, it's actually heavier. So the lighter stuff doesn't really move but if I throw it at the lighter guys, right? (Laughter) So it's cute, but it's also like a subtle channel of conveying information, right? This is heavy so it feels more important. So it's kind of cool.Despite computers everywhere paper really hasn't disappeared, because it has a lot of, I think, valuable properties. And some of those we wanted to transfer to the icons in our system. So one of the things you can do to our icons, just like paper, is crease them and fold them, just like paper. Remember, you know, something for later. Or if you want to be destructive, you can just crumple it up and, you know, toss it to the corner. Also just like paper, around our workspace we'll pin things up to the wall to remember them later, and I can do the same thing here, and you know, you'll see post-it notes and things like that around people's offices. And I can pull them off when I want to work with them.So, one of the criticisms of this kind of approach to organization is that, you know, \"Okay, well my real desk is really messy. I don't want that mess on my computer.\" So one thing we have for that is like a grid align, kind of \u2014 so you get that more traditional desktop. Things are kind of grid aligned. More boring, but you still have that kind of colliding and bumping. And you can still do fun things like make shelves on your desktop.Let's just break this shelf. Okay, that shelf broke. I think beyond the icons, I think another really cool domain for this software \u2014 I think it applies to more than just icons and your desktop \u2014 but browsing photographs. I think you can really enrich the way we browse our photographs and bring it to that kind of shoebox of, you know, photos with your family on the kitchen table kind of thing. I can toss these things around. They're so much more tangible and touchable \u2014 and you know I can double-click on something to take a look at it. And I can do all that kind of same stuff I showed you before. So I can pile things up, I can flip through it, I can, you know \u2014 okay, let's move this photo to the back, let's delete this guy here, and I think it's just a much more rich kind of way of interacting with your information.And that's BumpTop.

Just like on my real desk,\n\n00:01:25.958 --> 00:01:28.958\nI can -- let me just grab these guys -- I can turn things into piles\n\n00:01:28.958 --> 00:01:34.958\ninstead of just the folders that we have.\n\n00:01:34.958 --> 00:01:38.958\nAnd once things are in a pile I can browse them by throwing them into a grid,\n\n00:01:38.958 --> 00:01:41.958\nor you know, flip through them like a book\n\n00:01:41.958 --> 00:01:46.958\nor I can lay them out like a deck of cards.\n\n00:01:46.958 --> 00:01:51.958\nWhen they're laid out, I can pull things to new locations or delete things\n\n00:01:51.958 --> 00:01:56.958\nor just quickly sort a whole pile, you know, just immediately, right?\n\n00:01:56.958 --> 00:02:01.958\nAnd then, it's all smoothly animated, instead of these jarring changes you see in today's interfaces.\n\n00:02:01.958 --> 00:02:03.958\nAlso, if I want to add something to a pile, well, how do I do that?\n\n00:02:03.958 --> 00:02:09.958\nI just toss it to the pile, and it's added right to the top.

Thanks!"}, {"title": "We can be Buddhas", "duration": "726", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/bob_thurman_says_we_can_be_buddhas", "transcript": "Thank you. And I feel like this whole evening has been very amazing to me. I feel it's sort of like the Vimalakirti Sutra, an ancient work from ancient India in which the Buddha appears at the beginning and a whole bunch of people come to see him from the biggest city in the area, Vaishali, and they bring some sort of jeweled parasols to make an offering to him. All the young people, actually, from the city. The old fogeys don't come because they're mad at Buddha, because when he came to their city he accepted \u2014 he always accepts the first invitation that comes to him, from whoever it is, and the local geisha, a movie-star sort of person, raced the elders of the city in a chariot and invited him first.So he was hanging out with the movie star, and of course they were grumbling: \"He's supposed to be religious and all this. What's he doing over there at Amrapali's house with all his 500 monks,\" and so on. They were all grumbling, and so they boycotted him. They wouldn't go listen to him. But the young people all came. And they brought this kind of a jeweled parasol, and they put it on the ground. And as soon as they had laid all these, all their big stack of these jeweled parasols that they used to carry in ancient India, he performed a kind of special effect which made it into a giant planetarium, the wonder of the universe. Everyone looked in that, and they saw in there the total interconnectedness of all life in all universes.And of course, in the Buddhist cosmos there are millions and billions of planets with human life on it, and enlightened beings can see the life on all the other planets. So they don't \u2014 when they look out and they see those lights that you showed in the sky \u2014 they don't just see sort of pieces of matter burning or rocks or flames or gases exploding. They actually see landscapes and human beings and gods and dragons and serpent beings and goddesses and things like that.He made that special effect at the beginning to get everyone to think about interconnection and interconnectedness and how everything in life was totally interconnected. And then Leilei \u2014 I know his other name \u2014 told us about interconnection, and how we're all totally interconnected here, and how we've all known each other. And of course in the Buddhist universe, we've already done this already billions of times in many, many lifetimes in the past. And I didn't give the talk always. You did, and we had to watch you, and so forth. And we're all still trying to, I guess we're all trying to become TEDsters, if that's a modern form of enlightenment. I guess so. Because in a way, if a TEDster relates to all the interconnectedness of all the computers and everything, it's the forging of a mass awareness, of where everybody can really know everything that's going on everywhere in the planet.And therefore it will become intolerable \u2014 what compassion is, is where it will become intolerable for us, totally intolerable that we sit here in comfort and in pleasure and enjoying the life of the mind or whatever it is, and there are people who are absolutely riddled with disease and they cannot have a bite of food and they have no place, or they're being brutalized by some terrible person and so forth. It just becomes intolerable. With all of us knowing everything, we're kind of forced by technology to become Buddhas or something, to become enlightened.And of course, we all will be deeply disappointed when we do. Because we think that because we are kind of tired of what we do, a little bit tired, we do suffer. We do enjoy our misery in a certain way. We distract ourselves from our misery by running around somewhere, but basically we all have this common misery that we are sort of stuck inside our skins and everyone else is out there. And occasionally we get together with another person stuck in their skin and the two of us enjoy each other, and each one tries to get out of their own, and ultimately it fails of course, and then we're back into this thing.Because our egocentric perception \u2014 from the Buddha's point of view, misperception \u2014 is that all we are is what is inside our skin. And it's inside and outside, self and other, and other is all very different. And everyone here is unfortunately carrying that habitual perception, a little bit, right? You know, someone sitting next to you in a seat \u2014 that's OK because you're in a theater, but if you were sitting on a park bench and someone came up and sat that close to you, you'd freak out. What do they want from me? Like, who's that? And so you wouldn't sit that close to another person because of your notion that it's you versus the universe \u2014 that's all Buddha discovered. Because that cosmic basic idea that it is us all alone, each of us, and everyone else is different, then that puts us in an impossible situation, doesn't it? Who is it who's going to get enough attention from the world? Who's going to get enough out of the world? Who's not going to be overrun by an infinite number of other beings \u2014 if you're different from all the other beings?So where compassion comes is where you surprisingly discover you lose yourself in some way: through art, through meditation, through understanding, through knowledge actually, knowing that you have no such boundary, knowing your interconnectedness with other beings. You can experience yourself as the other beings when you see through the delusion of being separated from them. When you do that, you're forced to feel what they feel. Luckily, they say \u2014 I still am not sure \u2014 but luckily, they say that when you reach that point because some people have said in the Buddhist literature, they say, \"Oh who would really want to be compassionate? How awful! I'm so miserable on my own. My head is aching. My bones are aching. I go from birth to death. I'm never satisfied. I never have enough, even if I'm a billionaire, I don't have enough. I need a hundred billion.\" So I'm like that. Imagine if I had to feel even a hundred other people's suffering. It would be terrible.But apparently, this is a strange paradox of life. When you're no longer locked in yourself, and as the wisdom or the intelligence or the scientific knowledge of the nature of the world, that enables you to let your mind spread out, and empathize, and enhance the basic human ability of empathizing, and realizing that you are the other being, somehow by that opening, you can see the deeper nature of life. And you can, you get away from this terrible iron circle of I, me, me, mine, like the Beatles used to sing.You know, we really learned everything in the '60s. Too bad nobody ever woke up to it, and they've been trying to suppress it since then. I, me, me, mine. It's like a perfect song, that song. A perfect teaching. But when we're relieved from that, we somehow then become interested in all the other beings. And we feel ourselves differently. It's totally strange. It's totally strange. The Dalai Lama always likes to say \u2014 he says that when you give birth in your mind to the idea of compassion, it's because you realize that you yourself and your pains and pleasures are finally too small a theater for your intelligence. It's really too boring whether you feel like this or like that, or what, you know \u2014 and the more you focus on how you feel, by the way, the worse it gets. Like, even when you're having a good time, when is the good time over? The good time is over when you think, how good is it? And then it's never good enough.I love that Leilei said that the way of helping those who are suffering badly on the physical plane or on other planes is having a good time, doing it by having a good time. I think the Dalai Lama should have heard that. I wish he'd been there to hear that. He once told me \u2014 he looked kind of sad; he worries very much about the haves and have-nots. He looked a little sad, because he said, well, a hundred years ago, they went and took everything away from the haves. You know, the big communist revolutions, Russia and China and so forth. They took it all away by violence, saying they were going to give it to everyone, and then they were even worse. They didn't help at all.So what could possibly change this terrible gap that has opened up in the world today? And so then he looks at me. So I said, \"Well, you know, you're all in this yourself. You teach: it's generosity,\" was all I could think of. What is virtue? But of course, what you said, I think the key to saving the world, the key to compassion is that it is more fun. It should be done by fun. Generosity is more fun. That's the key. Everybody has the wrong idea. They think Buddha was so boring, and they're so surprised when they meet Dalai Lama and he's fairly jolly. Even though his people are being genocided \u2014 and believe me, he feels every blow on every old nun's head, in every Chinese prison. He feels it. He feels the way they are harvesting yaks nowadays. I won't even say what they do. But he feels it. And yet he's very jolly. He's extremely jolly.Because when you open up like that, then you can't just \u2014 what good does it do to add being miserable with others' misery? You have to find some vision where you see how hopeful it is, how it can be changed. Look at that beautiful thing Chiho showed us. She scared us with the lava man. She scared us with the lava man is coming, then the tsunami is coming, but then finally there were flowers and trees, and it was very beautiful. It's really lovely.So, compassion means to feel the feelings of others, and the human being actually is compassion. The human being is almost out of time. The human being is compassion because what is our brain for? Now, Jim's brain is memorizing the almanac. But he could memorize all the needs of all the beings that he is, he will, he did. He could memorize all kinds of fantastic things to help many beings. And he would have tremendous fun doing that.So the first person who gets happy, when you stop focusing on the self-centered situation of, how happy am I, where you're always dissatisfied \u2014 as Mick Jagger told us. You never get any satisfaction that way. So then you decide, \"Well, I'm sick of myself. I'm going to think of how other people can be happy. I'm going to get up in the morning and think, what can I do for even one other person, even a dog, my dog, my cat, my pet, my butterfly?\" And the first person who gets happy when you do that, you don't do anything for anybody else, but you get happier, you yourself, because your whole perception broadens and you suddenly see the whole world and all of the people in it. And you realize that this \u2014 being with these people \u2014 is the flower garden that Chiho showed us. It is Nirvana. And my time is up. And I know the TED commandments.

Everyone looked in that, and they saw in there\n\n00:01:46.958 --> 00:01:50.958\nthe total interconnectedness of all life in all universes.\n\n00:01:50.958 --> 00:01:54.958\nAnd of course, in the Buddhist cosmos there are millions and billions of planets\n\n00:01:54.958 --> 00:01:56.958\nwith human life on it,\n\n00:01:56.958 --> 00:01:59.958\nand enlightened beings can see the life on all the other planets.\n\n00:01:59.958 --> 00:02:02.958\nSo they don't -- when they look out and they see those lights that you showed\n\n00:02:02.958 --> 00:02:06.958\nin the sky -- they don't just see sort of pieces of matter burning\n\n00:02:06.958 --> 00:02:10.958\nor rocks or flames or gases exploding.\n\n00:02:10.958 --> 00:02:12.958\nThey actually see landscapes and human beings\n\n00:02:12.958 --> 00:02:18.958\nand gods and dragons and serpent beings and goddesses and things like that.\n\n00:02:18.958 --> 00:02:20.958\nHe made that special effect at the beginning\n\n00:02:20.958 --> 00:02:23.958\nto get everyone to think about interconnection\n\n00:02:23.958 --> 00:02:28.958\nand interconnectedness and how everything in life was totally interconnected.\n\n00:02:28.958 --> 00:02:36.958\nAnd then Leilei -- I know his other name -- told us about interconnection,\n\n00:02:36.958 --> 00:02:39.958\nand how we're all totally interconnected here,\n\n00:02:39.958 --> 00:02:42.958\nand how we've all known each other. And of course in the Buddhist universe,\n\n00:02:42.958 --> 00:02:47.958\nwe've already done this already billions of times in many, many lifetimes in the past.\n\n00:02:47.958 --> 00:02:56.958\nAnd I didn't give the talk always. You did, and we had to watch you, and so forth.\n\n00:02:56.958 --> 00:03:00.958\nAnd we're all still trying to, I guess we're all trying to become TEDsters,\n\n00:03:00.958 --> 00:03:04.958\nif that's a modern form of enlightenment.\n\n00:03:04.958 --> 00:03:08.958\nI guess so. Because in a way, if a TEDster relates to all the interconnectedness\n\n00:03:08.958 --> 00:03:14.958\nof all the computers and everything, it's the forging of a mass awareness,\n\n00:03:14.958 --> 00:03:16.958\nof where everybody can really know everything\n\n00:03:16.958 --> 00:03:18.958\nthat's going on everywhere in the planet.\n\n00:03:18.958 --> 00:03:20.958\nAnd therefore it will become intolerable --\n\n00:03:20.958 --> 00:03:24.958\nwhat compassion is, is where it will become intolerable for us,\n\n00:03:24.958 --> 00:03:30.958\ntotally intolerable that we sit here in comfort and in pleasure and enjoying\n\n00:03:30.958 --> 00:03:32.958\nthe life of the mind or whatever it is,\n\n00:03:32.958 --> 00:03:37.958\nand there are people who are absolutely riddled with disease\n\n00:03:37.958 --> 00:03:40.958\nand they cannot have a bite of food and they have no place,\n\n00:03:40.958 --> 00:03:43.958\nor they're being brutalized by some terrible person and so forth.\n\n00:03:43.958 --> 00:03:45.958\nIt just becomes intolerable.\n\n00:03:45.958 --> 00:03:51.958\nWith all of us knowing everything, we're kind of forced by technology\n\n00:03:51.958 --> 00:03:55.958\nto become Buddhas or something, to become enlightened.\n\n00:03:55.958 --> 00:04:01.958\nAnd of course, we all will be deeply disappointed when we do.\n\n00:04:01.958 --> 00:04:08.958\nBecause we think that because we are kind of tired of what we do,\n\n00:04:08.958 --> 00:04:10.958\na little bit tired, we do suffer.\n\n00:04:10.958 --> 00:04:13.958\nWe do enjoy our misery in a certain way.\n\n00:04:13.958 --> 00:04:16.958\nWe distract ourselves from our misery by running around somewhere,\n\n00:04:16.958 --> 00:04:18.958\nbut basically we all have this common misery\n\n00:04:18.958 --> 00:04:21.958\nthat we are sort of stuck inside our skins\n\n00:04:21.958 --> 00:04:24.958\nand everyone else is out there.\n\n00:04:24.958 --> 00:04:27.958\nAnd occasionally we get together with another person stuck in their skin\n\n00:04:27.958 --> 00:04:32.958\nand the two of us enjoy each other, and each one tries to get out of their own,\n\n00:04:32.958 --> 00:04:36.958\nand ultimately it fails of course, and then we're back into this thing.\n\n00:04:36.958 --> 00:04:42.958\nBecause our egocentric perception -- from the Buddha's point of view, misperception --\n\n00:04:42.958 --> 00:04:46.958\nis that all we are is what is inside our skin.\n\n00:04:46.958 --> 00:04:49.958\nAnd it's inside and outside, self and other,\n\n00:04:49.958 --> 00:04:50.958\nand other is all very different.\n\n00:04:50.958 --> 00:04:53.958\nAnd everyone here is unfortunately carrying that habitual perception,\n\n00:04:53.958 --> 00:04:56.958\na little bit, right?\n\n00:04:56.958 --> 00:04:59.958\nYou know, someone sitting next to you in a seat -- that's OK because you're in a theater,\n\n00:04:59.958 --> 00:05:02.958\nbut if you were sitting on a park bench and someone came up and sat that close to you,\n\n00:05:02.958 --> 00:05:04.958\nyou'd freak out.\n\n00:05:04.958 --> 00:05:07.958\nWhat do they want from me? Like, who's that?\n\n00:05:07.958 --> 00:05:10.958\nAnd so you wouldn't sit that close to another person\n\n00:05:10.958 --> 00:05:16.958\nbecause of your notion that it's you versus the universe -- that's all Buddha discovered.\n\n00:05:16.958 --> 00:05:21.958\nBecause that cosmic basic idea that it is us all alone, each of us,\n\n00:05:21.958 --> 00:05:24.958\nand everyone else is different,\n\n00:05:24.958 --> 00:05:27.958\nthen that puts us in an impossible situation, doesn't it?\n\n00:05:27.958 --> 00:05:30.958\nWho is it who's going to get enough attention from the world?\n\n\n00:05:30.958 --> 00:05:33.958\nWho's going to get enough out of the world?\n\n00:05:33.958 --> 00:05:36.958\nWho's not going to be overrun by an infinite number of other beings --\n\n00:05:36.958 --> 00:05:39.958\nif you're different from all the other beings?\n\n00:05:39.958 --> 00:05:43.958\nSo where compassion comes is where you\n\n00:05:43.958 --> 00:05:48.958\nsurprisingly discover you lose yourself in some way:\n\n00:05:48.958 --> 00:05:53.958\nthrough art, through meditation, through understanding, through knowledge actually,\n\n00:05:53.958 --> 00:05:55.958\nknowing that you have no such boundary,\n\n00:05:55.958 --> 00:05:58.958\nknowing your interconnectedness with other beings.\n\n00:05:58.958 --> 00:06:01.958\nYou can experience yourself as the other beings\n\n00:06:01.958 --> 00:06:06.958\nwhen you see through the delusion of being separated from them.\n\n00:06:06.958 --> 00:06:09.958\nWhen you do that, you're forced to feel what they feel.\n\n00:06:09.958 --> 00:06:13.958\nLuckily, they say -- I still am not sure --\n\n00:06:13.958 --> 00:06:17.958\nbut luckily, they say that when you reach that point because some people have said\n\n00:06:17.958 --> 00:06:20.958\nin the Buddhist literature, they say, \"Oh who would really want to be compassionate?\n\n00:06:20.958 --> 00:06:25.958\nHow awful! I'm so miserable on my own. My head is aching.\n\n00:06:25.958 --> 00:06:28.958\nMy bones are aching. I go from birth to death. I'm never satisfied.\n\n00:06:28.958 --> 00:06:31.958\nI never have enough, even if I'm a billionaire, I don't have enough.\n\n00:06:31.958 --> 00:06:34.958\nI need a hundred billion.\" So I'm like that.\n\n00:06:34.958 --> 00:06:40.958\nImagine if I had to feel even a hundred other people's suffering.\n\n00:06:40.958 --> 00:06:42.958\nIt would be terrible.\n\n00:06:42.958 --> 00:06:45.958\nBut apparently, this is a strange paradox of life.\n\n00:06:45.958 --> 00:06:49.958\nWhen you're no longer locked in yourself,\n\n00:06:49.958 --> 00:06:52.958\nand as the wisdom or the intelligence or the scientific knowledge\n\n00:06:52.958 --> 00:07:00.958\nof the nature of the world, that enables you to let your mind spread out,\n\n00:07:00.958 --> 00:07:04.958\nand empathize, and enhance the basic human ability of empathizing,\n\n00:07:04.958 --> 00:07:07.958\nand realizing that you are the other being,\n\n00:07:07.958 --> 00:07:13.958\nsomehow by that opening, you can see the deeper nature of life. And you can,\n\n00:07:13.958 --> 00:07:21.958\nyou get away from this terrible iron circle of I, me, me, mine,\n\n00:07:21.958 --> 00:07:23.958\nlike the Beatles used to sing.\n\n00:07:23.958 --> 00:07:25.958\nYou know, we really learned everything in the '60s.\n\n00:07:25.958 --> 00:07:29.958\nToo bad nobody ever woke up to it,\n\n00:07:29.958 --> 00:07:31.958\nand they've been trying to suppress it since then.\n\n00:07:31.958 --> 00:07:36.958\nI, me, me, mine. It's like a perfect song, that song. A perfect teaching.\n\n00:07:36.958 --> 00:07:39.958\nBut when we're relieved from that,\n\n00:07:39.958 --> 00:07:41.958\nwe somehow then become interested in all the other beings.\n\n00:07:41.958 --> 00:07:45.958\nAnd we feel ourselves differently. It's totally strange.\n\n00:07:45.958 --> 00:07:47.958\nIt's totally strange.\n\n00:07:47.958 --> 00:07:50.958\nThe Dalai Lama always likes to say --\n\n00:07:50.958 --> 00:07:55.958\nhe says that when you give birth in your mind to the idea of compassion,\n\n00:07:55.958 --> 00:07:59.958\nit's because you realize that you yourself and your pains and pleasures\n\n00:07:59.958 --> 00:08:03.958\nare finally too small a theater for your intelligence.\n\n00:08:03.958 --> 00:08:08.958\nIt's really too boring whether you feel like this or like that, or what, you know --\n\n00:08:08.958 --> 00:08:14.958\nand the more you focus on how you feel, by the way, the worse it gets.\n\n00:08:14.958 --> 00:08:16.958\nLike, even when you're having a good time,\n\n00:08:16.958 --> 00:08:18.958\nwhen is the good time over?\n\n00:08:18.958 --> 00:08:22.958\nThe good time is over when you think, how good is it?\n\n00:08:22.958 --> 00:08:25.958\nAnd then it's never good enough.\n\n00:08:25.958 --> 00:08:30.958\nI love that Leilei said that the way of helping those who are suffering badly\n\n00:08:30.958 --> 00:08:35.958\non the physical plane or on other planes is having a good time,\n\n00:08:35.958 --> 00:08:37.958\ndoing it by having a good time.\n\n00:08:37.958 --> 00:08:40.958\nI think the Dalai Lama should have heard that. I wish he'd been there to hear that.\n\n00:08:40.958 --> 00:08:42.958\nHe once told me -- he looked kind of sad;\n\n00:08:42.958 --> 00:08:44.958\nhe worries very much about the haves and have-nots.\n\n00:08:44.958 --> 00:08:48.958\nHe looked a little sad, because he said, well, a hundred years ago,\n\n00:08:48.958 --> 00:08:51.958\nthey went and took everything away from the haves.\n\n00:08:51.958 --> 00:08:54.958\nYou know, the big communist revolutions, Russia and China and so forth.\n\n00:08:54.958 --> 00:08:56.958\nThey took it all away by violence,\n\n00:08:56.958 --> 00:09:00.958\nsaying they were going to give it to everyone, and then they were even worse.\n\n00:09:00.958 --> 00:09:02.958\nThey didn't help at all.\n\n00:09:02.958 --> 00:09:08.958\nSo what could possibly change this terrible gap that has opened up in the world today?\n\n00:09:08.958 --> 00:09:10.958\nAnd so then he looks at me.\n\n00:09:10.958 --> 00:09:15.958\nSo I said, \"Well, you know, you're all in this yourself. You teach: it's generosity,\"\n\n00:09:15.958 --> 00:09:18.958\nwas all I could think of. What is virtue?\n\n00:09:18.958 --> 00:09:24.958\nBut of course, what you said, I think the key to saving the world, the key to compassion\n\n00:09:24.958 --> 00:09:28.958\nis that it is more fun.\n\n00:09:28.958 --> 00:09:33.958\nIt should be done by fun. Generosity is more fun. That's the key.\n\n00:09:33.958 --> 00:09:37.958\nEverybody has the wrong idea. They think Buddha was so boring,\n\n00:09:37.958 --> 00:09:41.958\nand they're so surprised when they meet Dalai Lama and he's fairly jolly.\n\n00:09:41.958 --> 00:09:43.958\nEven though his people are being genocided --\n\n00:09:43.958 --> 00:09:48.958\nand believe me, he feels every blow on every old nun's head,\n\n00:09:48.958 --> 00:09:51.958\nin every Chinese prison. He feels it.\n\n00:09:51.958 --> 00:09:54.958\nHe feels the way they are harvesting yaks nowadays.\n\n00:09:54.958 --> 00:09:58.958\nI won't even say what they do. But he feels it.\n\n00:09:58.958 --> 00:10:02.958\nAnd yet he's very jolly. He's extremely jolly.\n\n00:10:02.958 --> 00:10:05.958\nBecause when you open up like that,\n\n00:10:05.958 --> 00:10:11.958\nthen you can't just -- what good does it do to add being miserable with others' misery?\n\n00:10:11.958 --> 00:10:14.958\nYou have to find some vision where you see how hopeful it is,\n\n00:10:14.958 --> 00:10:16.958\nhow it can be changed.\n\n00:10:16.958 --> 00:10:20.958\nLook at that beautiful thing Chiho showed us. She scared us with the lava man.\n\n00:10:20.958 --> 00:10:23.958\nShe scared us with the lava man is coming,\n\n00:10:23.958 --> 00:10:25.958\nthen the tsunami is coming,\n\n00:10:25.958 --> 00:10:31.958\nbut then finally there were flowers and trees, and it was very beautiful.\n\n00:10:31.958 --> 00:10:33.958\nIt's really lovely.\n\n00:10:33.958 --> 00:10:39.958\nSo, compassion means to feel the feelings of others,\n\n00:10:39.958 --> 00:10:42.958\nand the human being actually is compassion.\n\n00:10:42.958 --> 00:10:46.958\nThe human being is almost out of time.\n\n00:10:46.958 --> 00:10:50.958\nThe human being is compassion because what is our brain for?\n\n00:10:50.958 --> 00:10:56.958\nNow, Jim's brain is memorizing the almanac.\n\n00:10:56.958 --> 00:11:01.958\nBut he could memorize all the needs of all the beings that he is, he will, he did.\n\n00:11:01.958 --> 00:11:06.958\nHe could memorize all kinds of fantastic things to help many beings.\n\n00:11:06.958 --> 00:11:09.958\nAnd he would have tremendous fun doing that.\n\n00:11:09.958 --> 00:11:11.958\nSo the first person who gets happy,\n\n00:11:11.958 --> 00:11:16.958\nwhen you stop focusing on the self-centered situation of, how happy am I,\n\n00:11:16.958 --> 00:11:18.958\nwhere you're always dissatisfied --\n\n00:11:18.958 --> 00:11:23.958\nas Mick Jagger told us. You never get any satisfaction that way.\n\n00:11:23.958 --> 00:11:25.958\nSo then you decide, \"Well, I'm sick of myself.\n\n00:11:25.958 --> 00:11:28.958\nI'm going to think of how other people can be happy.\n\n00:11:28.958 --> 00:11:29.958\nI'm going to get up in the morning and think,\n\n00:11:29.958 --> 00:11:33.958\nwhat can I do for even one other person, even a dog, my dog, my cat,\n\n00:11:33.958 --> 00:11:36.958\nmy pet, my butterfly?\"\n\n00:11:36.958 --> 00:11:38.958\nAnd the first person who gets happy when you do that,\n\n00:11:38.958 --> 00:11:43.958\nyou don't do anything for anybody else, but you get happier, you yourself,\n\n00:11:43.958 --> 00:11:46.958\nbecause your whole perception broadens\n\n00:11:46.958 --> 00:11:50.958\nand you suddenly see the whole world and all of the people in it.\n\n00:11:50.958 --> 00:11:52.958\nAnd you realize that this -- being with these people --\n\n00:11:52.958 --> 00:11:54.958\nis the flower garden that Chiho showed us.\n\n00:11:54.958 --> 00:11:56.958\nIt is Nirvana.\n\n00:11:56.958 --> 00:11:58.958\nAnd my time is up. And I know the TED commandments.\n\n00:11:58.958 --> 00:12:00.958\nThank you."}, {"title": "A memorial at Ground Zero", "duration": "1477", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/david_rockwell_builds_at_ground_zero", "transcript": "Kurt Andersen: Like many architects, David is a hog for the limelight but is sufficiently reticent \u2014 or at least pretends to be \u2014 that he asked me to question him rather than speaking. In fact what we're going to talk about, I think, is in fact a subject that is probably better served by a conversation than an address. And I guess we have a bit of news clip to precede.Dan Rather: Since the September 11th attack on the World Trade Center, many people have flocked to downtown New York to see and pay respects at what amounts to the 16-acre burial ground. Now, as CBS's Jim Axelrod reports, they're putting the finishing touches on a new way for people to visit and view the scene.Jim Axelrod: Forget the Empire State Building or the Statue of Liberty. There's a new place in New York where the crowds are thickest \u2014 Ground Zero.Tourist: I've taken my step-daughter here from Indianapolis. This was \u2014 out of all the tourist sites in New York City \u2014 this was her number-one pick.JA: Thousands now line up on lower Broadway.Tourist: I've been wanting to come down here since this happened.JA: Even on the coldest winter days. To honor and remember.Tourist: It's reality, it's us. It happened here. This is ours.JA: So many, in fact, that seeing has become a bit of a problem.Tourist: I think that people are very frustrated that they're not able to get closer to see what's going on.JA: But that is about to change. In record time, a team of architects and construction workers designed and built a viewing platform to ease the frustration and bring people closer.Man: They'll get an incredible panorama and understand, I think more completely, the sheer totality of the destruction of the place.JA: If you think about it, Ground Zero is unlike most any other tourist site in America. Unlike the Grand Canyon or the Washington Monument, people come here to see what's no longer there.David Rockwell: The first experience people will have here when they see this is not as a construction site but as this incredibly moving burial ground.JA: The walls are bare by design, so people can fill them with their own memorials the way they already have along the current perimeter.Tourist: From our hearts, it affected us just as much.JA: The ramps are made of simple material \u2014 the kind of plywood you see at construction sites \u2014 which is really the whole point. In the face of America's worst destruction people are building again. Jim Axelrod, CBS News, New York.KA: This is not an obvious subject to be in the sensuality segment, but certainly David you are known as \u2014 I know, a phrase you hate \u2014 an entertainment architect. Your work is highly sensual, even hedonistic.DR: I like that word.KA: It's about pleasure \u2014 casinos and hotels and restaurants. How did the shock that all of us \u2014 and especially all of us in New York \u2014 felt on the 11th of September transmute into your desire to do this thing?DR: Well the truth of the matter is, post-September 11th, I felt myself in the role originally \u2014 first of all as someone who lives in Tribeca and whose neighborhood was devastated, and as someone who works less than a mile from there \u2014 that I was in the role of forcing 100 people who work with me in my firm, to continue to have the same level of enthusiasm about creating the places we had been creating. In fact we're finishing a book which is called \"Pleasure,\" which is about sensual pleasure in spaces.But I've got to tell you \u2014 it became impossible to do that. We were really paralyzed. And I found myself the Friday after September 11th \u2014 two days afterwards \u2014 literally unable to motivate anyone to do anything. We gave the office a few days off.And in discussing this with other architects, we had seen people saying in the press that they should rebuild the towers as they were \u2014 they should rebuild them 50 stories taller. And I thought it was astonishing to speculate, as if this were a competition, on something that was such a fresh wound. And I had a series of discussions \u2014 first with Rick Scofidio and Liz Diller, who collaborated with us on this, and several other people \u2014 and really felt like we had to find relevance in doing something. And that as people who create places, the ultimate way to help wasn't to pontificate or to make up scenarios, but to help right now. So we tried to come up with a way, as a group, to have a kind of design SWAT team. And that was the mission that we came up with.KA: Were you conscious of suddenly \u2014 as a designer whose work is all about fulfilling wants \u2014 suddenly fulfilling needs?DR: Well what I was aware of was, there was this overwhelming need to act now. And we were asked to participate in a few projects before this. There was a school, PS 234, that had been evacuated down at Ground Zero. They moved to an abandoned school. We took about 20 or 30 architects and designers and artists, and over four days \u2014 it was like this urban barn-raising \u2014 to renovate it, and everyone wanted to help. It was just extraordinary. Tom Otterness contributed, Maira Kalman contributed and it became this cathartic experience for us.KA: And that was done, effectively, by October 8 or something?DR: Yeah.KA: Obviously, what you faced in trying to do something as substantial as this project \u2014 and this is only one of four that you've designed to surround the site \u2014 you must have run up against the incredibly byzantine, entrenched bureaucracy and powers that be in New York real estate and New York politics.DR: Well, it's a funny thing. We finished PS 234, and had dinner with a small group. I was actually asked to be a committee chair on an AIA committee to rebuild. And I sat in on several meetings. And there were the most circuitous grand plans that had to do with long-term infrastructure and rebuilding the entire city. And the fact is that there were immediate wounds and needs that needed to be filled, and there was talk about inclusion and wanting it to be an inclusive process. And it wasn't an inclusive group. So we said, what is \u2014KA: It was not an inclusive group?DR: It was not an inclusive group. It was predominantly a white, rich, corporate group that was not representative of the city.KA: Shocking.DR: Yeah, surprising. So Rick and Liz and Kevin and I came up with the idea. The city actually approached us. We first approached the city about Pier 94. We saw how PS 234 worked. The families \u2014 the victims of the families \u2014 were going to this pier that was incredibly dehumanizing.KA: On the Hudson River?DR: Yeah. And the city actually \u2014 through Tim Zagat initially, and then through Christyne Nicholas, then we got to Giuliani \u2014 said, \"You know we don't want to do anything with Pier 94 right now, but we have an observation platform for the families down at Ground Zero that we'd like to be a more dignified experience for the families, and a way to protect it from the weather.\"So I went down there with Rick and Liz and Kevin, and I've got to say, it was the most moving experience of my life. It was devastating to see the simple plywood platform with a rail around it, where the families of the victims had left notes to them. And there was no mediation between us and the experience. There was no filter.And I remembered on September 11th, on 14th Street, the roof of our building \u2014 we can see the World Trade Towers prominently \u2014 and I saw the first building collapse from a conference room on the eighth floor on a TV that we had set up. And then everyone was up on the roof, so I ran up there. And it was amazing how much harder it was to believe in real life than it was on TV. There was something about the comfort of the filter and how much information was between us and the experience. So seeing this in a very simple, dignified way was a very powerful experience.So we went back to the city and said we're not particularly interested in the upgrade of this as a VIP platform, but we've spent some time down there. At the same time the city had this need. They were looking for a solution to deal with 30 or 40 thousand people a day who were going down there, that had nowhere to go. And there was no way to deal with the traffic around the site. So dealing with it is just an immediate master plan. There was a way \u2014 there had to be a way \u2014 to get people to move around the site.KA: But then you've got to figure out a way \u2014 we will skip over the insanely tedious process of getting permits and getting everybody on board \u2014 but simply funding this thing. It looks like a fairly simple thing, but this was a half a million dollar project?DR: Well, we knew that if it wasn't privately funded, it wasn't going to happen. And we also, frankly, knew that if it didn't happen by the end of the Giuliani administration, then everyone who we were dealing with at the DOT and the Police Department and all of the \u2014 we were meeting with 20 or 30 people with the city at a time, and it was set up by the Office of Emergency Management. This incredible act on their part, because they really wanted this, and they sensed that this needed to happen.KA: And there was therefore this ticking clock, because Giuliani was obviously out three months after that.DR: Yeah. So the first thing we had to do was find a way to get this \u2014 we had to work with the families of the victims, through the city, to make sure that they knew this was happening. Because this didn't want to be a surprise. And we also had to be as under the radar screen as we could be in New York, because the key was not raising a lot of objection and sort of working as quietly as possible.We came up with the idea of setting up a foundation, mainly because when we found a contractor who would build this, he would not agree to do this, even if we would pay him the money. There needed to be a foundation in place. So we came up with a foundation, and actually what happened was one major developer in New York \u2014KA: Who shall remain nameless, I guess?DR: Yeah. His initials are JS, and he owns Rockefeller Center, if that helps anyone \u2014 volunteered to help. And we met with him. The prices from the contractors were between five to 700,000 dollars. And Atlantic-Heydt, who's the largest scaffolding contractor in the country, volunteered to do it at cost. So this developer said, \"You know what, we'll underwrite the entire expense.\" And we said, \"That's incredible!\"And I think this was the 21st, and we knew this had to be built and up by the 28th. And we had to start construction the next day. We had a meeting that evening with his contractor of choice, and the contractor showed up with the drawings of the platform about half the size that we had drawn it.KA: Sort of like the Spinal Tap scene where you get the tiny little Stonehenge, I guess? (Laughter)DR: In fact, it was as if this was going to be window-washing scaffolding. There was no sense of the fact that this is next to Saint Paul \u2014 that this is really a place that needs to be kind of dignified, and a place to reflect and remember. And I've got to say that we spent a lot of time in putting this together, watching the crowds that gathered at Saint Paul \u2014 which is just to the right \u2014 and moving around the site. And I live down there, so we spent a lot of time looking at the need.And I think people were amazed at two things \u2014 I think they were amazed at the destruction, but I think there was a sense of disbelief about the heroics of New Yorkers that I found very moving. Just the sort of everyday heroics of New Yorkers.So we were in this meeting and the contractor literally said, \"I'm going to lock the door, because this developer will not agree to have you leave till you've signed off on this.\" And we said, \"Well, this is half the size, it doesn't have any of the design features that have been agreed upon by everyone \u2014 everyone in the city. We'd have to go back to the beginning to do this.\" And I convinced him that we should leave the room with the agreement to build it as designed.The next day I got an email from the developer saying that he was withdrawing all funding. So we didn't know what to do, but we decided to cast a very wide net. We emailed out letters to as many people as we could \u2014 several people in the audience here \u2014 who were very helpful.KA: There was no thought of abandoning ship at that point?DR: No. In fact I told the contractor to go ahead. He had already ordered materials based on my go-ahead. We knew that one way or another this was going to happen. And we just felt it had to happen.KA: You were funding it yourself and with contributions and this foundation. Richard, I think very correctly, made the point at the beginning \u2014 before all the chair designers came out \u2014 about the history of chair designers imposing aesthetic solutions on this kind of universal, banal, common problem of sitting. It seems to me with this, that it was the opposite of that. This was an unprecedented, singular design problem.DR: Well here's the issue: we knew that this was not in the sense of \u2014 we think about the site, and think about the need for a memorial. It was important that this not be categorized as a memorial. That this was a place for people to reflect, to remember \u2014 a kind of quiet place.So it led us to using design solutions that created as few filters between the viewer \u2014 as we said about the families' platform \u2014 and the experience as possible. It's all incredibly humble material. It's scaffolding and plywood. And it allows \u2014 by sort of the procession of the movement, up by Saint Paul's and down the other side \u2014 it gives you about 300 feet to go up 13 feet from the ground to where you get the 360 degree view.But the design was driven by a need to be quick, cheap, safe, respectful, flexible. One of the other things is this is designed to be moveable. Because when we looked at the four platforms around the site, one of which is an upgrade of the families' platform, we knew that these had to be moveable to respond to changing conditions, and the changing definition of what Ground Zero is.KA: Your work \u2014 I mean, we've talked about this before \u2014 a lot of your work, I think, is informed by your belief in, or your focus on the temporariness of all things and the evanescence of things, and a kind of \"Eat, drink, and be merry, for tomorrow we die,\" sort of sense of existence. This is clearly not a work for the ages. You know, a couple of years this thing isn't going to be here. Did that require, as an architect, a new way of thinking about what you were doing? To think of it as this purely temporary installation?DR: No, I don't think so. I think this is, obviously, substantially different from anything we'd ever thought about doing before, just by the nature of it. Where it overlaps with thoughts about our work in general is, number one \u2014 the notion of collaboration as a sort of way to get things done. And Kevin Kennon, Rick Scofidio, Liz Diller and all the people within the city \u2014 Norman Lear, who I spoke to four hours before our deadline for funding, offered to give us a bridge loan to help us get through it. So the notion of collaboration \u2014 I think this reinforces how important that is.And in terms of the temporary nature of it, our goal was not to create something that would be there longer than it needed to be. I think what we were most interested in was promoting a kind of dialogue that we felt may not have been happening enough in this city, about what's really happening there.And a day or two before it opened was Giuliani's farewell address, where he proposed the idea of all of Ground Zero being a memorial. Which was very controversial, but it resonated with a lot of people. And I think regardless of what the position is about how this sacred piece of land is to be used, having it come out of actually seeing it in a real encounter, I think makes it a more powerful dialogue. And that's what we were interested in. So that, very much, is in the realm of things I've been interested in before.KA: It seems to me, among other things, a lovely piece of civic infrastructure. It enables that conversation to get serious. And six months after the fact \u2014 and only a few months away from the site being cleaned \u2014 we are very quickly, now, getting to the point where those conversations about what should go there are getting serious. Do you have \u2014 having been as physically involved in the site as you have been doing this project \u2014 have any ideas about what should or shouldn't be done?DR: Well, I think one thing that shouldn't be done is evaluate \u2014 I think right now the discussion is a very closed discussion on the master plan. The Protetch Gallery recently had a show on ideas for buildings, which had some sort of inventive ideas of buildings.KA: But it had some really terrible ideas.DR: And it also felt a little bit like a kind of competition of ideas, where I think the focus of ideas should be on master planning and uses. And I think there should be a broader \u2014 which there's starting to be \u2014 the dialogue is really opening up to, what does this site really want to be? And I truly believe until the issue of memorial is sorted out, that it's going to be very hard to have an intelligent discussion. There's a few discussions right now that I think are very positive, about depressing the West Side Highway and connecting this over, so that there's one uninterrupted piece of land.KA: Well, I think that's interesting. And it gets to another issue that was probably inappropriate to discuss six months ago, but perhaps isn't now, which is, not many of us love the World Trade Center as a piece of architecture, as what it had done to this city and that huge plaza. Is this an opportunity, is the silver lining \u2014 a silver lining, here \u2014 to rebuild some more traditional city grid, or not?DR: I think there's a real opportunity to engage in a discussion of why we live in cities. And why do we live in places where such dissimilar people collide up against us each day? I don't think it has much to do with 50 or 60 or 70 or 80 thousand new office spaces, regardless of what the number is. So yeah, I think there is a chance to re-look at how we think about cities.And in fact, there's a proposal on the table now for building number seven.KA: Which was the building just north of the Towers?DR: Right, which the towers fell into. And the reason that's been held up is essentially by community outrage that they're not re-opening the street to connect that back to the rest of the city. I think a public dialogue \u2014 I think, you know, I'd like to see an international competition, and a call for ideas for uses.KA: Whether it's arts, whether it's housing, whether it's what amount of shopping?DR: Right. And we're looking for other things. This small foundation we put together is looking for other ways to help. Including taking a small piece adjacent to the site and inviting 10 architects who currently don't have a voice in New York to do artist housing. And find other ways to encourage the discussion to be against sort of monolithic, single solutions, and more about a multiplicity of things.KA: Before we end, I know you have a piece of digital video of the experience of being on this platform?DR: John Kamen \u2014 who's here, actually \u2014 put together a two and a half minute piece that shows the platform in use. So I thought that would be good to end with.DR: We're looking from Fulton Street, west. One of the tricky issues we had with the Giuliani administration was I had forgotten how anti-graffiti he was. And essentially our structure was designed to be written on.KA: As you say, it's not a memorial. But were you conscious of memorials? The Vietnam Memorial? Those kinds of forms?DR: We certainly did as much research as we could, and we were conscious of other memorials. And also the complexity and length of time they really take to do. It's 350 people on the committee for Oklahoma City, which is why we thought of this as a sort of ad-hoc, spontaneous solution that expanded on Union Square and the places that were ad-hoc memorials in the city already.The scaffolding you can see built up over the street is de-mountable.What's interesting now is the nature of the site has totally changed, so that what you're aware of is not just the destruction of the buildings in Ground Zero, but all of the buildings around it \u2014 and the scars on the building around it, which are enormous. This shows Saint Paul's on the left.KA: I just want to thank you on behalf of New Yorkers for making this happen and getting this done. But the kind of virtually instantaneous nature of its erection, and its being there, almost before you could believe that a response of this magnitude could be accomplished, is part of its extraordinary \u2014 I don't know if beauty is the word \u2014 but presence.DR: It was an honor to do. And we were thrilled to be able to show it here.", "id": 8, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:13.958 --> 00:00:16.958\nKurt Andersen: Like many architects, David is a hog for the limelight\n\n00:00:16.958 --> 00:00:19.958\nbut is sufficiently reticent -- or at least pretends to be --\n\n00:00:19.958 --> 00:00:24.958\nthat he asked me to question him rather than speaking.\n\n00:00:24.958 --> 00:00:26.958\nIn fact what we're going to talk about,\n\n00:00:26.958 --> 00:00:34.958\nI think, is in fact a subject that is probably better served\n\n00:00:34.958 --> 00:00:35.958\nby a conversation than an address.\n\n00:00:35.958 --> 00:00:42.958\nAnd I guess we have a bit of news clip to precede.\n\n00:00:44.958 --> 00:00:48.958\nDan Rather: Since the September 11th attack on the World Trade Center,\n\n00:00:48.958 --> 00:00:50.958\nmany people have flocked to downtown New York to see\n\n00:00:50.958 --> 00:00:55.958\nand pay respects at what amounts to the 16-acre burial ground.\n\n00:00:55.958 --> 00:00:59.958\nNow, as CBS's Jim Axelrod reports, they're putting the finishing touches\n\n00:00:59.958 --> 00:01:02.958\non a new way for people to visit and view the scene.\n\n00:01:02.958 --> 00:01:06.958\nJim Axelrod: Forget the Empire State Building or the Statue of Liberty.\n\n00:01:06.958 --> 00:01:08.958\nThere's a new place in New York\n\n00:01:08.958 --> 00:01:10.958\nwhere the crowds are thickest -- Ground Zero.\n\n00:01:10.958 --> 00:01:14.958\nTourist: I've taken my step-daughter here from Indianapolis.\n\n00:01:14.958 --> 00:01:18.958\nThis was -- out of all the tourist sites in New York City --\n\n00:01:18.958 --> 00:01:19.958\nthis was her number-one pick.\n\n00:01:19.958 --> 00:01:22.958\nJA: Thousands now line up on lower Broadway.\n\n00:01:22.958 --> 00:01:27.958\nTourist: I've been wanting to come down here since this happened.\n\n00:01:27.958 --> 00:01:29.958\nJA: Even on the coldest winter days.\n\n00:01:29.958 --> 00:01:32.958\nTo honor and remember.\n\n00:01:32.958 --> 00:01:34.958\nTourist: It's reality, it's us.

on.\n\n00:01:45.958 --> 00:01:47.958\nJA: But that is about to change.\n\n00:01:47.958 --> 00:01:49.958\nIn record time,\n\n00:01:49.958 --> 00:01:51.958\na team of architects and construction workers\n\n00:01:51.958 --> 00:01:57.958\ndesigned and built a viewing platform to ease the frustration\n\n00:01:57.958 --> 00:01:58.958\nand bring people closer.\n\n00:01:58.958 --> 00:02:01.958\nMan: They'll get an incredible panorama\n\n00:02:01.958 --> 00:02:03.958\nand understand, I think more completely,\n\n00:02:03.958 --> 00:02:08.958\nthe sheer totality of the destruction of the place.\n\n00:02:08.958 --> 00:02:10.958\nJA: If you think about it, Ground Zero is unlike\n\n00:02:10.958 --> 00:02:12.958\nmost any other tourist site in America.\n\n00:02:12.958 --> 00:02:15.958\nUnlike the Grand Canyon or the Washington Monument,\n\n00:02:15.958 --> 00:02:19.958\npeople come here to see what's no longer there.\n\n00:02:19.958 --> 00:02:22.958\nDavid Rockwell: The first experience people will have here\n\n00:02:22.958 --> 00:02:24.958\nwhen they see this is not as a construction site\n\n00:02:24.958 --> 00:02:27.958\nbut as this incredibly moving burial ground.\n\n00:02:27.958 --> 00:02:30.958\nJA: The walls are bare by design, so people can fill them\n\n00:02:30.958 --> 00:02:33.958\nwith their own memorials the way they already have\n\n00:02:33.958 --> 00:02:35.958\nalong the current perimeter.\n\n00:02:35.958 --> 00:02:38.958\nTourist: From our hearts, it affected us just as much.\n\n00:02:38.958 --> 00:02:40.958\nJA: The ramps are made of simple material --\n\n00:02:40.958 --> 00:02:42.958\nthe kind of plywood you see at construction sites --\n\n00:02:42.958 --> 00:02:44.958\nwhich is really the whole point.\n\n00:02:44.958 --> 00:02:47.958\nIn the face of America's worst destruction\n\n00:02:47.958 --> 00:02:50.958\npeople are building again.\n\n00:02:50.958 --> 00:02:52.958\nJim Axelrod, CBS News, New York.\n\n00:02:53.958 --> 00:02:58.958\nKA: This is not an obvious subject to be in the sensuality segment,\n\n00:02:58.958 --> 00:03:04.958\nbut certainly David you are known as -- I know, a phrase you hate --\n\n00:03:04.958 --> 00:03:06.958\nan entertainment architect.\n\n00:03:06.958 --> 00:03:11.958\nYour work is highly sensual, even hedonistic.\n\n00:03:12.958 --> 00:03:14.958\nDR: I like that word.\n\n00:03:14.958 --> 00:03:21.958\nKA: It's about pleasure -- casinos and hotels and restaurants.\n\n00:03:21.958 --> 00:03:24.958\nHow did the shock that all of us -- and especially all of us in New York --\n\n00:03:24.958 --> 00:03:29.958\nfelt on the 11th of September transmute\n\n00:03:29.958 --> 00:03:32.958\ninto your desire to do this thing?\n\n00:03:32.958 --> 00:03:37.958\nDR: Well the truth of the matter is, post-September 11th,\n\n00:03:37.958 --> 00:03:39.958\nI felt myself in the role originally --\n\n00:03:39.958 --> 00:03:42.958\nfirst of all as someone who lives in Tribeca\n\n00:03:42.958 --> 00:03:46.958\nand whose neighborhood was devastated,\n\n00:03:46.958 --> 00:03:49.958\nand as someone who works less than a mile from there --\n\n00:03:49.958 --> 00:03:55.958\nthat I was in the role of forcing 100 people who work with me\n\n00:03:55.958 --> 00:03:59.958\nin my firm, to continue to have the same level of enthusiasm\n\n00:03:59.958 --> 00:04:01.958\nabout creating the places we had been creating.\n\n00:04:01.958 --> 00:04:05.958\nIn fact we're finishing a book which is called \"Pleasure,\"\n\n00:04:05.958 --> 00:04:08.958\nwhich is about sensual pleasure in spaces.\n\n00:04:08.958 --> 00:04:11.958\nBut I've got to tell you -- it became impossible to do that.\n\n00:04:11.958 --> 00:04:13.958\nWe were really paralyzed.\n\n00:04:13.958 --> 00:04:17.958\nAnd I found myself the Friday after September 11th --\n\n00:04:17.958 --> 00:04:19.958\ntwo days afterwards --\n\n00:04:19.958 --> 00:04:22.958\nliterally unable to motivate anyone to do anything.\n\n00:04:22.958 --> 00:04:25.958\nWe gave the office a few days off.\n\n00:04:25.958 --> 00:04:29.958\nAnd in discussing this with other architects,\n\n00:04:29.958 --> 00:04:34.958\nwe had seen people saying in the press\n\n00:04:34.958 --> 00:04:37.958\nthat they should rebuild the towers as they were --\n\n00:04:37.958 --> 00:04:40.958\nthey should rebuild them 50 stories taller.\n\n00:04:40.958 --> 00:04:43.958\nAnd I thought it was astonishing to speculate,\n\n00:04:43.958 --> 00:04:45.958\nas if this were a competition,\n\n00:04:45.958 --> 00:04:47.958\non something that was such a fresh wound.\n\n00:04:47.958 --> 00:04:51.958\nAnd I had a series of discussions --\n\n00:04:51.958 --> 00:04:55.958\nfirst with Rick Scofidio and Liz Diller, who collaborated with us on this,\n\n00:04:55.958 --> 00:04:58.958\nand several other people --\n\n00:04:58.958 --> 00:05:02.958\nand really felt like we had to find relevance in doing something.\n\n00:05:02.958 --> 00:05:08.958\nAnd that as people who create places, the ultimate way to help\n\n00:05:08.958 --> 00:05:12.958\nwasn't to pontificate or to make up scenarios,\n\n00:05:12.958 --> 00:05:14.958\nbut to help right now.\n\n00:05:14.958 --> 00:05:16.958\nSo we tried to come up with a way,\n\n00:05:16.958 --> 00:05:18.958\nas a group, to have a kind of design SWAT team.\n\n00:05:18.958 --> 00:05:22.958\nAnd that was the mission that we came up with.\n\n00:05:22.958 --> 00:05:24.958\nKA: Were you conscious of suddenly --\n\n00:05:24.958 --> 00:05:29.958\nas a designer whose work is all about fulfilling wants --\n\n00:05:29.958 --> 00:05:34.958\nsuddenly fulfilling needs?\n\n00:05:34.958 --> 00:05:36.958\nDR: Well what I was aware of was,\n\n00:05:36.958 --> 00:05:38.958\nthere was this overwhelming need to act now.\n\n00:05:38.958 --> 00:05:46.958\nAnd we were asked to participate in a few projects before this.\n\n00:05:47.958 --> 00:05:52.958\nThere was a school, PS 234, that had been evacuated down at Ground Zero.\n\n00:05:52.958 --> 00:05:55.958\nThey moved to an abandoned school.\n\n00:05:55.958 --> 00:05:58.958\nWe took about 20 or 30 architects and designers and artists,\n\n00:05:58.958 --> 00:06:01.958\nand over four days -- it was like this urban barn-raising --\n\n00:06:01.958 --> 00:06:03.958\nto renovate it, and everyone wanted to help.\n\n00:06:03.958 --> 00:06:05.958\nIt was just extraordinary.\n\n00:06:05.958 --> 00:06:08.958\nTom Otterness contributed, Maira Kalman contributed\n\n00:06:08.958 --> 00:06:12.958\nand it became this cathartic experience for us.\n\n00:06:12.958 --> 00:06:14.958\nKA: And that was done, effectively,\n\n00:06:14.958 --> 00:06:16.958\nby October 8 or something?\n\n00:06:16.958 --> 00:06:18.958\nDR: Yeah.\n\n00:06:18.958 --> 00:06:21.958\nKA: Obviously, what you faced in trying to do something\n\n00:06:21.958 --> 00:06:24.958\nas substantial as this project -- and this is only one of four\n\n00:06:24.958 --> 00:06:27.958\nthat you've designed to surround the site --\n\n00:06:27.958 --> 00:06:34.958\nyou must have run up against the incredibly byzantine,\n\n00:06:34.958 --> 00:06:39.958\nentrenched bureaucracy and powers that be\n\n00:06:39.958 --> 00:06:41.958\nin New York real estate and New York politics.\n\n00:06:41.958 --> 00:06:43.958\nDR: Well, it's a funny thing.\n\n00:06:43.958 --> 00:06:46.958\nWe finished PS 234, and had dinner with a small group.\n\n00:06:46.958 --> 00:06:51.958\nI was actually asked to be a committee chair on an AIA committee to rebuild.\n\n00:06:51.958 --> 00:06:53.958\nAnd I sat in on several meetings.\n\n00:06:53.958 --> 00:06:57.958\nAnd there were the most circuitous grand plans\n\n00:06:57.958 --> 00:07:02.958\nthat had to do with long-term infrastructure and rebuilding the entire city.\n\n00:07:02.958 --> 00:07:08.958\nAnd the fact is that there were immediate wounds and needs that needed to be filled,\n\n00:07:08.958 --> 00:07:11.958\nand there was talk about inclusion and wanting it to be an inclusive process.\n\n00:07:11.958 --> 00:07:13.958\nAnd it wasn't an inclusive group.\n\n00:07:13.958 --> 00:07:14.958\nSo we said, what is --\n\n00:07:14.958 --> 00:07:16.958\nKA: It was not an inclusive group?\n\n00:07:16.958 --> 00:07:18.958\nDR: It was not an inclusive group.\n\n00:07:18.958 --> 00:07:21.958\nIt was predominantly a white, rich, corporate group\n\n00:07:21.958 --> 00:07:25.958\nthat was not representative of the city.\n\n00:07:25.958 --> 00:07:27.958\nKA: Shocking.\n\n00:07:27.958 --> 00:07:29.958\nDR: Yeah, surprising.\n\n00:07:29.958 --> 00:07:34.958\nSo Rick and Liz and Kevin and I came up with the idea.\n\n00:07:34.958 --> 00:07:38.958\nThe city actually approached us.\n\n00:07:38.958 --> 00:07:41.958\nWe first approached the city about Pier 94.\n\n00:07:41.958 --> 00:07:43.958\nWe saw how PS 234 worked.\n\n00:07:43.958 --> 00:07:45.958\nThe families -- the victims of the families --\n\n00:07:45.958 --> 00:07:47.958\nwere going to this pier that was incredibly dehumanizing.\n\n00:07:47.958 --> 00:07:49.958\nKA: On the Hudson River?\n\n00:07:49.958 --> 00:07:52.958\nDR: Yeah. And the city actually -- through Tim Zagat initially,\n\n00:07:52.958 --> 00:07:55.958\nand then through Christyne Nicholas, then we got to Giuliani --\n\n00:07:55.958 --> 00:07:58.958\nsaid, \"You know we don't want to do anything with Pier 94 right now,\n\n00:07:58.958 --> 00:08:01.958\nbut we have an observation platform for the families down at Ground Zero\n\n00:08:01.958 --> 00:08:05.958\nthat we'd like to be a more dignified experience for the families,\n\n00:08:05.958 --> 00:08:07.958\nand a way to protect it from the weather.\"\n\n00:08:07.958 --> 00:08:11.958\nSo I went down there with Rick and Liz and Kevin,\n\n00:08:11.958 --> 00:08:16.958\nand I've got to say, it was the most moving experience of my life.\n\n00:08:16.958 --> 00:08:20.958\nIt was devastating to see the simple plywood platform with a rail around it,\n\n00:08:20.958 --> 00:08:23.958\nwhere the families of the victims had left notes to them.\n\n00:08:23.958 --> 00:08:27.958\nAnd there was no mediation between us and the experience.\n\n00:08:27.958 --> 00:08:29.958\nThere was no filter.\n\n00:08:29.958 --> 00:08:34.958\nAnd I remembered on September 11th, on 14th Street,\n\n00:08:34.958 --> 00:08:37.958\nthe roof of our building -- we can see the World Trade Towers prominently --\n\n00:08:37.958 --> 00:08:44.958\nand I saw the first building collapse from a conference room\n\n00:08:44.958 --> 00:08:46.958\non the eighth floor on a TV that we had set up.\n\n00:08:46.958 --> 00:08:49.958\nAnd then everyone was up on the roof, so I ran up there.\n\n00:08:50.958 --> 00:08:53.958\nAnd it was amazing how much harder it was\n\n00:08:53.958 --> 00:08:56.958\nto believe in real life than it was on TV.\n\n00:08:56.958 --> 00:08:58.958\nThere was something about the comfort of the filter\n\n00:08:58.958 --> 00:09:01.958\nand how much information was between us and the experience.\n\n00:09:01.958 --> 00:09:03.958\nSo seeing this in a very simple,\n\n00:09:03.958 --> 00:09:07.958\ndignified way was a very powerful experience.\n\n00:09:07.958 --> 00:09:09.958\nSo we went back to the city and said\n\n00:09:09.958 --> 00:09:12.958\nwe're not particularly interested in the upgrade of this as a VIP platform,\n\n00:09:12.958 --> 00:09:17.958\nbut we've spent some time down there.\n\n00:09:17.958 --> 00:09:22.958\nAt the same time the city had this need.\n\n00:09:22.958 --> 00:09:24.958\nThey were looking for a solution\n\n00:09:24.958 --> 00:09:26.958\nto deal with 30 or 40 thousand people a day\n\n00:09:26.958 --> 00:09:29.958\nwho were going down there, that had nowhere to go.\n\n00:09:29.958 --> 00:09:32.958\nAnd there was no way to deal with the traffic around the site.\n\n00:09:32.958 --> 00:09:34.958\nSo dealing with it is just an immediate master plan.\n\n00:09:34.958 --> 00:09:36.958\nThere was a way -- there had to be a way --\n\n00:09:36.958 --> 00:09:39.958\nto get people to move around the site.\n\n00:09:39.958 --> 00:09:42.958\nKA: But then you've got to figure out a way --\n\n00:09:42.958 --> 00:09:47.958\nwe will skip over the insanely tedious process of getting permits\n\n00:09:47.958 --> 00:09:50.958\nand getting everybody on board -- but simply funding this thing.\n\n00:09:50.958 --> 00:09:53.958\nIt looks like a fairly simple thing,\n\n00:09:53.958 --> 00:09:55.958\nbut this was a half a million dollar project?\n\n00:09:55.958 --> 00:09:57.958\nDR: Well, we knew that if it wasn't privately funded,\n\n00:09:57.958 --> 00:09:59.958\nit wasn't going to happen.\n\n00:09:59.958 --> 00:10:01.958\nAnd we also, frankly, knew that if it didn't happen\n\n00:10:01.958 --> 00:10:03.958\nby the end of the Giuliani administration,\n\n00:10:03.958 --> 00:10:05.958\nthen everyone who we were dealing with at the DOT\n\n00:10:05.958 --> 00:10:08.958\nand the Police Department and all of the --\n\n00:10:08.958 --> 00:10:12.958\nwe were meeting with 20 or 30 people with the city at a time,\n\n00:10:12.958 --> 00:10:15.958\nand it was set up by the Office of Emergency Management.\n\n00:10:15.958 --> 00:10:19.958\nThis incredible act on their part, because they really wanted this,\n\n00:10:19.958 --> 00:10:21.958\nand they sensed that this needed to happen.\n\n00:10:21.958 --> 00:10:24.958\nKA: And there was therefore this ticking clock,\n\n00:10:24.958 --> 00:10:27.958\nbecause Giuliani was obviously out three months after that.\n\n00:10:28.958 --> 00:10:32.958\nDR: Yeah. So the first thing we had to do was find a way to get this --\n\n00:10:32.958 --> 00:10:36.958\nwe had to work with the families of the victims,\n\n00:10:36.958 --> 00:10:39.958\nthrough the city, to make sure that they knew this was happening.\n\n00:10:39.958 --> 00:10:41.958\nBecause this didn't want to be a surprise.\n\n00:10:41.958 --> 00:10:45.958\nAnd we also had to be as under the radar screen as we could be in New York,\n\n00:10:45.958 --> 00:10:48.958\nbecause the key was not raising a lot of objection\n\n00:10:48.958 --> 00:10:53.958\nand sort of working as quietly as possible.\n\n00:10:53.958 --> 00:10:56.958\nWe came up with the idea of setting up a foundation,\n\n00:10:56.958 --> 00:11:01.958\nmainly because when we found a contractor who would build this,\n\n00:11:01.958 --> 00:11:07.958\nhe would not agree to do this, even if we would pay him the money.\n\n00:11:07.958 --> 00:11:08.958\nThere needed to be a foundation in place.\n\n00:11:08.958 --> 00:11:13.958\nSo we came up with a foundation, and actually what happened was\n\n00:11:13.958 --> 00:11:15.958\none major developer in New York --\n\n00:11:15.958 --> 00:11:17.958\nKA: Who shall remain nameless, I guess?\n\n00:11:17.958 --> 00:11:20.958\nDR: Yeah. His initials are JS, and he owns Rockefeller Center,\n\n00:11:20.958 --> 00:11:24.958\nif that helps anyone -- volunteered to help.\n\n00:11:24.958 --> 00:11:26.958\nAnd we met with him.\n\n00:11:26.958 --> 00:11:32.958\nThe prices from the contractors were between five to 700,000 dollars.\n\n00:11:32.958 --> 00:11:35.958\nAnd Atlantic-Heydt, who's the largest scaffolding contractor in the country,\n\n00:11:35.958 --> 00:11:38.958\nvolunteered to do it at cost.\n\n00:11:39.958 --> 00:11:42.958\nSo this developer said, \"You know what, we'll underwrite the entire expense.\"\n\n00:11:42.958 --> 00:11:44.958\nAnd we said, \"That's incredible!\"\n\n00:11:45.958 --> 00:11:47.958\nAnd I think this was the 21st,\n\n00:11:47.958 --> 00:11:49.958\nand we knew this had to be built and up by the 28th.\n\n00:11:49.958 --> 00:11:53.958\nAnd we had to start construction the next day.\n\n00:11:53.958 --> 00:11:57.958\nWe had a meeting that evening with his contractor of choice,\n\n00:11:57.958 --> 00:12:01.958\nand the contractor showed up with the drawings of the platform\n\n00:12:01.958 --> 00:12:03.958\nabout half the size that we had drawn it.\n\n00:12:03.958 --> 00:12:05.958\nKA: Sort of like the Spinal Tap scene where you get\n\n00:12:05.958 --> 00:12:07.958\nthe tiny little Stonehenge, I guess?\n\n00:12:07.958 --> 00:12:11.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:12:11.958 --> 00:12:14.958\nDR: In fact, it was as if this was going to be window-washing scaffolding.\n\n00:12:14.958 --> 00:12:18.958\nThere was no sense of the fact that this is next to Saint Paul --\n\n00:12:18.958 --> 00:12:22.958\nthat this is really a place that needs to be kind of dignified,\n\n00:12:22.958 --> 00:12:24.958\nand a place to reflect and remember.\n\n00:12:24.958 --> 00:12:27.958\nAnd I've got to say that we spent a lot of time\n\n00:12:27.958 --> 00:12:30.958\nin putting this together, watching the crowds that gathered at Saint Paul --\n\n00:12:30.958 --> 00:12:32.958\nwhich is just to the right -- and moving around the site.\n\n00:12:32.958 --> 00:12:36.958\nAnd I live down there, so we spent a lot of time looking at the need.\n\n00:12:36.958 --> 00:12:40.958\nAnd I think people were amazed at two things --\n\n00:12:40.958 --> 00:12:42.958\nI think they were amazed at the destruction,\n\n00:12:42.958 --> 00:12:45.958\nbut I think there was a sense of disbelief\n\n00:12:45.958 --> 00:12:49.958\nabout the heroics of New Yorkers that I found very moving.\n\n00:12:49.958 --> 00:12:52.958\nJust the sort of everyday heroics of New Yorkers.\n\n00:12:52.958 --> 00:12:57.958\nSo we were in this meeting and the contractor literally said,\n\n00:12:57.958 --> 00:12:59.958\n\"I'm going to lock the door, because this developer\n\n00:12:59.958 --> 00:13:03.958\nwill not agree to have you leave till you've signed off on this.\"\n\n00:13:03.958 --> 00:13:05.958\nAnd we said, \"Well, this is half the size,\n\n00:13:05.958 --> 00:13:09.958\nit doesn't have any of the design features\n\n00:13:09.958 --> 00:13:11.958\nthat have been agreed upon by everyone -- everyone in the city.\n\n00:13:11.958 --> 00:13:15.958\nWe'd have to go back to the beginning to do this.\"\n\n00:13:15.958 --> 00:13:18.958\nAnd I convinced him that we should leave the room\n\n00:13:18.958 --> 00:13:22.958\nwith the agreement to build it as designed.\n\n00:13:22.958 --> 00:13:25.958\nThe next day I got an email from the developer\n\n00:13:25.958 --> 00:13:28.958\nsaying that he was withdrawing all funding.\n\n00:13:29.958 --> 00:13:33.958\nSo we didn't know what to do,\n\n00:13:33.958 --> 00:13:35.958\nbut we decided to cast a very wide net.\n\n00:13:35.958 --> 00:13:38.958\nWe emailed out letters to as many people as we could --\n\n00:13:38.958 --> 00:13:42.958\nseveral people in the audience here -- who were very helpful.\n\n00:13:42.958 --> 00:13:45.958\nKA: There was no thought of abandoning ship at that point?\n\n00:13:45.958 --> 00:13:49.958\nDR: No. In fact I told the contractor to go ahead.\n\n00:13:49.958 --> 00:13:51.958\nHe had already ordered materials based on my go-ahead.\n\n00:13:51.958 --> 00:13:54.958\nWe knew that one way or another this was going to happen.\n\n00:13:54.958 --> 00:13:59.958\nAnd we just felt it had to happen.\n\n00:13:59.958 --> 00:14:04.958\nKA: You were funding it yourself and with contributions and this foundation.\n\n00:14:05.958 --> 00:14:10.958\nRichard, I think very correctly,\n\n00:14:10.958 --> 00:14:12.958\nmade the point at the beginning --\n\n00:14:12.958 --> 00:14:15.958\nbefore all the chair designers came out --\n\n00:14:16.958 --> 00:14:21.958\nabout the history of chair designers imposing aesthetic solutions\n\n00:14:21.958 --> 00:14:25.958\non this kind of universal, banal, common problem of sitting.\n\n00:14:25.958 --> 00:14:29.958\nIt seems to me with this,\n\n00:14:29.958 --> 00:14:31.958\nthat it was the opposite of that.\n\n00:14:31.958 --> 00:14:35.958\nThis was an unprecedented, singular design problem.\n\n00:14:35.958 --> 00:14:37.958\nDR: Well here's the issue:\n\n00:14:37.958 --> 00:14:40.958\nwe knew that this was not in the sense of --\n\n00:14:40.958 --> 00:14:46.958\nwe think about the site, and think about the need for a memorial.\n\n00:14:48.958 --> 00:14:49.958\nIt was important that this not be categorized as a memorial.\n\n00:14:49.958 --> 00:14:55.958\nThat this was a place for people to reflect, to remember --\n\n00:14:55.958 --> 00:14:57.958\na kind of quiet place.\n\n00:14:58.958 --> 00:15:02.958\nSo it led us to using design solutions\n\n00:15:02.958 --> 00:15:05.958\nthat created as few filters between the viewer --\n\n00:15:05.958 --> 00:15:08.958\nas we said about the families' platform -- and the experience as possible.\n\n00:15:08.958 --> 00:15:11.958\nIt's all incredibly humble material.\n\n00:15:11.958 --> 00:15:15.958\nIt's scaffolding and plywood.\n\n00:15:15.958 --> 00:15:19.958\nAnd it allows -- by sort of the procession of the movement,\n\n00:15:19.958 --> 00:15:22.958\nup by Saint Paul's and down the other side --\n\n00:15:22.958 --> 00:15:26.958\nit gives you about 300 feet to go up 13 feet from the ground\n\n00:15:26.958 --> 00:15:29.958\nto where you get the 360 degree view.\n\n00:15:29.958 --> 00:15:37.958\nBut the design was driven by a need to be quick, cheap, safe, respectful, flexible.\n\n00:15:37.958 --> 00:15:40.958\nOne of the other things is this is designed to be moveable.\n\n00:15:40.958 --> 00:15:44.958\nBecause when we looked at the four platforms around the site,\n\n00:15:44.958 --> 00:15:47.958\none of which is an upgrade of the families' platform,\n\n00:15:47.958 --> 00:15:49.958\nwe knew that these had to be moveable\n\n00:15:49.958 --> 00:15:51.958\nto respond to changing conditions,\n\n00:15:51.958 --> 00:15:57.958\nand the changing definition of what Ground Zero is.\n\n00:15:57.958 --> 00:16:00.958\nKA: Your work -- I mean, we've talked about this before --\n\n00:16:00.958 --> 00:16:06.958\na lot of your work, I think, is informed by your belief in, or your focus on\n\n00:16:06.958 --> 00:16:10.958\nthe temporariness of all things and the evanescence of things,\n\n00:16:10.958 --> 00:16:14.958\nand a kind of \"Eat, drink, and be merry, for tomorrow we die,\"\n\n00:16:14.958 --> 00:16:17.958\nsort of sense of existence.\n\n00:16:17.958 --> 00:16:22.958\nThis is clearly not a work for the ages.\n\n00:16:23.958 --> 00:16:26.958\nYou know, a couple of years this thing isn't going to be here.\n\n00:16:27.958 --> 00:16:30.958\nDid that require, as an architect,\n\n00:16:30.958 --> 00:16:32.958\na new way of thinking about what you were doing?\n\n00:16:32.958 --> 00:16:36.958\nTo think of it as this purely temporary installation?\n\n00:16:36.958 --> 00:16:38.958\nDR: No, I don't think so.\n\n00:16:38.958 --> 00:16:42.958\nI think this is, obviously, substantially different\n\n00:16:42.958 --> 00:16:45.958\nfrom anything we'd ever thought about doing before, just by the nature of it.\n\n00:16:47.958 --> 00:16:52.958\nWhere it overlaps with thoughts about our work in general is,\n\n00:16:52.958 --> 00:16:56.958\nnumber one -- the notion of collaboration as a sort of way to get things done.\n\n00:16:56.958 --> 00:17:01.958\nAnd Kevin Kennon, Rick Scofidio, Liz Diller\n\n00:17:01.958 --> 00:17:06.958\nand all the people within the city --\n\n00:17:06.958 --> 00:17:11.958\nNorman Lear, who I spoke to four hours before our deadline for funding,\n\n00:17:11.958 --> 00:17:15.958\noffered to give us a bridge loan to help us get through it.\n\n00:17:15.958 --> 00:17:17.958\nSo the notion of collaboration --\n\n00:17:17.958 --> 00:17:20.958\nI think this reinforces how important that is.\n\n00:17:20.958 --> 00:17:24.958\nAnd in terms of the temporary nature of it,\n\n00:17:24.958 --> 00:17:26.958\nour goal was not to create something\n\n00:17:26.958 --> 00:17:29.958\nthat would be there longer than it needed to be.\n\n00:17:29.958 --> 00:17:34.958\nI think what we were most interested in was promoting a kind of dialogue\n\n00:17:34.958 --> 00:17:38.958\nthat we felt may not have been happening enough in this city,\n\n00:17:38.958 --> 00:17:41.958\nabout what's really happening there.\n\n00:17:41.958 --> 00:17:47.958\nAnd a day or two before it opened was Giuliani's farewell address,\n\n00:17:47.958 --> 00:17:50.958\nwhere he proposed the idea of all of Ground Zero being a memorial.\n\n00:17:50.958 --> 00:17:53.958\nWhich was very controversial, but it resonated with a lot of people.\n\n00:17:53.958 --> 00:17:58.958\nAnd I think regardless of what the position is about how\n\n00:17:58.958 --> 00:18:02.958\nthis sacred piece of land is to be used,\n\n00:18:02.958 --> 00:18:07.958\nhaving it come out of actually seeing it in a real encounter,\n\n00:18:07.958 --> 00:18:09.958\nI think makes it a more powerful dialogue.\n\n00:18:09.958 --> 00:18:11.958\nAnd that's what we were interested in.\n\n00:18:11.958 --> 00:18:14.958\nSo that, very much, is in the realm of things\n\n00:18:14.958 --> 00:18:16.958\nI've been interested in before.\n\n00:18:16.958 --> 00:18:19.958\nKA: It seems to me, among other things, a lovely piece of civic infrastructure.\n\n00:18:19.958 --> 00:18:23.958\nIt enables that conversation to get serious.\n\n00:18:23.958 --> 00:18:26.958\nAnd six months after the fact --\n\n00:18:26.958 --> 00:18:30.958\nand only a few months away from the site being cleaned --\n\n00:18:30.958 --> 00:18:32.958\nwe are very quickly, now, getting to the point\n\n00:18:32.958 --> 00:18:37.958\nwhere those conversations about what should go there are getting serious.\n\n00:18:37.958 --> 00:18:42.958\nDo you have -- having been as physically involved in the site\n\n00:18:42.958 --> 00:18:44.958\nas you have been doing this project -- have any ideas about\n\n00:18:44.958 --> 00:18:46.958\nwhat should or shouldn't be done?\n\n00:18:46.958 --> 00:18:51.958\nDR: Well, I think one thing that shouldn't be done is evaluate --\n\n00:18:51.958 --> 00:18:57.958\nI think right now the discussion is a very closed discussion on the master plan.\n\n00:18:57.958 --> 00:19:02.958\nThe Protetch Gallery recently had a show on ideas for buildings,\n\n00:19:02.958 --> 00:19:06.958\nwhich had some sort of inventive ideas of buildings.\n\n00:19:06.958 --> 00:19:08.958\nKA: But it had some really terrible ideas.\n\n00:19:08.958 --> 00:19:12.958\nDR: And it also felt a little bit like a kind of competition of ideas,\n\n00:19:12.958 --> 00:19:17.958\nwhere I think the focus of ideas should be on master planning and uses.\n\n00:19:17.958 --> 00:19:20.958\nAnd I think there should be a broader -- which there's starting to be --\n\n00:19:20.958 --> 00:19:22.958\nthe dialogue is really opening up to,\n\n00:19:22.958 --> 00:19:24.958\nwhat does this site really want to be?\n\n00:19:24.958 --> 00:19:28.958\nAnd I truly believe until the issue of memorial is sorted out,\n\n00:19:28.958 --> 00:19:31.958\nthat it's going to be very hard to have an intelligent discussion.\n\n00:19:31.958 --> 00:19:36.958\nThere's a few discussions right now that I think are very positive,\n\n00:19:36.958 --> 00:19:40.958\nabout depressing the West Side Highway and connecting this over,\n\n00:19:40.958 --> 00:19:43.958\nso that there's one uninterrupted piece of land.\n\n00:19:43.958 --> 00:19:45.958\nKA: Well, I think that's interesting.\n\n00:19:45.958 --> 00:19:48.958\nAnd it gets to another issue that was probably inappropriate\n\n00:19:48.958 --> 00:19:50.958\nto discuss six months ago, but perhaps isn't now,\n\n00:19:50.958 --> 00:19:56.958\nwhich is, not many of us love the World Trade Center as a piece of architecture,\n\n00:19:56.958 --> 00:20:00.958\nas what it had done to this city and that huge plaza.\n\n00:20:00.958 --> 00:20:03.958\nIs this an opportunity, is the silver lining --\n\n00:20:03.958 --> 00:20:05.958\na silver lining, here -- to rebuild\n\n00:20:05.958 --> 00:20:09.958\nsome more traditional city grid, or not?\n\n00:20:09.958 --> 00:20:11.958\nDR: I think there's a real opportunity to engage\n\n00:20:11.958 --> 00:20:13.958\nin a discussion of why we live in cities.\n\n00:20:13.958 --> 00:20:17.958\nAnd why do we live in places where such dissimilar people\n\n00:20:17.958 --> 00:20:19.958\ncollide up against us each day?\n\n00:20:19.958 --> 00:20:24.958\nI don't think it has much to do with 50 or 60 or 70 or 80 thousand new office spaces,\n\n00:20:24.958 --> 00:20:26.958\nregardless of what the number is.\n\n00:20:26.958 --> 00:20:30.958\nSo yeah, I think there is a chance to re-look at how we think about cities.\n\n00:20:30.958 --> 00:20:36.958\nAnd in fact, there's a proposal on the table now for building number seven.\n\n00:20:36.958 --> 00:20:38.958\nKA: Which was the building just north of the Towers?\n\n00:20:38.958 --> 00:20:40.958\nDR: Right, which the towers fell into.\n\n00:20:40.958 --> 00:20:45.958\nAnd the reason that's been held up is essentially by community outrage\n\n00:20:45.958 --> 00:20:47.958\nthat they're not re-opening the street\n\n00:20:47.958 --> 00:20:49.958\nto connect that back to the rest of the city.\n\n00:20:49.958 --> 00:20:52.958\nI think a public dialogue -- I think, you know,\n\n00:20:52.958 --> 00:20:56.958\nI'd like to see an international competition,\n\n00:20:56.958 --> 00:20:59.958\nand a call for ideas for uses.\n\n00:20:59.958 --> 00:21:01.958\nKA: Whether it's arts, whether it's housing,\n\n00:21:01.958 --> 00:21:03.958\nwhether it's what amount of shopping?\n\n00:21:03.958 --> 00:21:05.958\nDR: Right. And we're looking for other things.\n\n00:21:05.958 --> 00:21:08.958\nThis small foundation we put together is looking for other ways to help.\n\n00:21:08.958 --> 00:21:12.958\nIncluding taking a small piece adjacent to the site\n\n00:21:12.958 --> 00:21:16.958\nand inviting 10 architects who currently don't have a voice\n\n00:21:16.958 --> 00:21:18.958\nin New York to do artist housing.\n\n00:21:18.958 --> 00:21:20.958\nAnd find other ways to encourage the discussion\n\n00:21:20.958 --> 00:21:23.958\nto be against sort of monolithic, single solutions,\n\n00:21:23.958 --> 00:21:27.958\nand more about a multiplicity of things.\n\n00:21:27.958 --> 00:21:34.958\nKA: Before we end, I know you have a piece of digital video\n\n00:21:34.958 --> 00:21:37.958\nof the experience of being on this platform?\n\n00:21:37.958 --> 00:21:40.958\nDR: John Kamen -- who's here, actually -- put together\n\n00:21:40.958 --> 00:21:43.958\na two and a half minute piece that shows the platform in use.\n\n00:21:43.958 --> 00:21:48.958\nSo I thought that would be good to end with.\n\n00:21:58.958 --> 00:22:04.958\nDR: We're looking from Fulton Street, west.\n\n00:22:04.958 --> 00:22:08.958\nOne of the tricky issues we had with the Giuliani administration\n\n00:22:08.958 --> 00:22:11.958\nwas I had forgotten how anti-graffiti he was.\n\n00:22:11.958 --> 00:22:18.958\nAnd essentially our structure was designed to be written on.\n\n00:22:18.958 --> 00:22:20.958\nKA: As you say, it's not a memorial.\n\n00:22:20.958 --> 00:22:22.958\nBut were you conscious of memorials?

And the answer I like to offer is what they typically do is they think about the future of wars in the context of war. And what I've spent 15 years doing in this business \u2014 and it's taken me almost 14 to figure it out \u2014 is I think about the future of wars in the context of everything else. So I tend to specialize on the scene between war and peace. The material I'm going to show you is one idea from a book with a lot of ideas. It's the one that takes me around the world right now interacting with foreign militaries quite a bit. The material was generated in two years of work I did for the Secretary of Defense, thinking about a new national grand strategy for the United States. I'm going to present a problem and try to give you an answer.Here's my favorite bonehead concept from the 1990s in the Pentagon: the theory of anti-access, area-denial asymmetrical strategies. Why do we call it that? Because it's got all those A's lined up I guess. This is gobbledygook for if the United States fights somebody we're going to be huge. They're going to be small. And if they try to fight us in the traditional, straight-up manner we're going to kick their ass, which is why people don't try to do that any more. I met the last Air Force General who had actually shot down an enemy plane in combat. He's now a one star General. That's how distant we are from even meeting an air force willing to fly against ours. So that overmatched capability creates problems \u2014 catastrophic successes the White House calls them.(Laughter)And we're trying to figure that out, because it is an amazing capability. The question is, what's the good you can do with it? OK? The theory of anti-access, area-denial asymmetrical strategies \u2014 gobbledygook that we sell to Congress, because if we just told them we can kick anybody's asses they wouldn't buy us all the stuff we want. So we say, area-denial, anti-access asymmetrical strategies and their eyes glaze over.(Laughter)And they say, \"Will you build it in my district?\"(Laughter)(Applause)Here's my parody and it ain't much of one. Let's talk about a battle space. I don't know, Taiwan Straits 2025. Let's talk about an enemy embedded within that battle space. I don't know, the Million Man Swim.(Laughter)The United States has to access that battle space instantaneously. They throw up anti-access, area-denial asymmetrical strategies. A banana peel on the tarmac.(Laughter)Trojan horses on our computer networks reveal all our Achilles' heels instantly. We say, \"China, it's yours.\" Prometheus approach, largely a geographic definition, focuses almost exclusively on the start of conflict. We field the first-half team in a league that insists on keeping score until the end of the game. That's the problem. We can run the score up against anybody, and then get our asses kicked in the second half \u2014 what they call fourth generation warfare.Here's the way I like to describe it instead. There is no battle space the U.S. Military cannot access. They said we couldn't do Afghanistan. We did it with ease. They said we couldn't do Iraq. We did it with 150 combat casualties in six weeks. We did it so fast we weren't prepared for their collapse. There is nobody we can't take down. The question is, what do you do with the power?So there's no trouble accessing battle spaces. What we have trouble accessing is the transition space that must naturally follow, and creating the peace space that allows us to move on. Problem is, the Defense Department over here beats the hell out of you. The State Department over here says, \"Come on boy, I know you can make it.\" And that poor country runs off that ledge, does that cartoon thing and then drops.(Laughter)This is not about overwhelming force, but proportional force. It's about non-lethal technologies, because if you fire real ammo into a crowd of women and children rioting you're going to lose friends very quickly. This is not about projecting power, but about staying power, which is about legitimacy with the locals. Who do you access in this transition space?You have to create internal partners. You have to access coalition partners. We asked the Indians for 17,000 peace keepers. I know their senior leadership, they wanted to give it to us. But they said to us, \"You know what? In that transition space you're mostly hat not enough cattle. We don't think you can pull it off, we're not going to give you our 17,000 peace keepers for fodder.\" We asked the Russians for 40,000. They said no. I was in China in August, I said, \"You should have 50,000 peace keepers in Iraq. It's your oil, not ours.\" Which is the truth. It's their oil. And the Chinese said to me, \"Dr. Barnett, you're absolutely right. In a perfect world we'd have 50,000 there. But it's not a perfect world, and your administration isn't getting us any closer.\" But we have trouble accessing our outcomes.We lucked out, frankly, on the selection. We face different opponents across these three. And it's time to start admitting you can't ask the same 19-year-old to do it all, day in and day out. It's just too damn hard. We have an unparalleled capacity to wage war. We don't do the everything else so well. Frankly, we do it better than anybody and we still suck at it. We have a brilliant Secretary of War. We don't have a Secretary of Everything Else. Because if we did, that guy would be in front of the Senate, still testifying over Abu Ghraib. The problem is he doesn't exist. There is no Secretary of Everything Else. I think we have an unparalleled capacity to wage war. I call that the Leviathan Force. What we need to build is a force for the Everything Else. I call them the System Administrators.What I think this really represents is lack of an A to Z rule set for the world as a whole for processing politically bankrupt states. We have one for processing economically bankrupt states. It's the IMF Sovereign Bankruptcy Plan, OK? We argue about it every time we use it. Argentina just went through it, broke a lot of rules. They got out on the far end, we said, \"Fine, don't worry about it.\" It's transparent. A certain amount of certainty gives the sense of a non-zero outcome. We don't have one for processing politically bankrupt states that, frankly, everybody wants gone. Like Saddam, like Mugabe, like Kim Jong-Il \u2014 people who kill in hundreds of thousands or millions. Like the 250,000 dead so far in Sudan.What would an A to Z system look like? I'm going to distinguish between what I call front half and back half. And let's call this red line, I don't know, mission accomplished.(Laughter)(Applause)What we have extant right now, at the beginning of this system, is the U.N. Security Council as a grand jury. What can they do? They can indict your ass. They can debate it. They can write it on a piece of paper. They can put it in an envelope and mail it to you, and then say in no uncertain terms, \"Please cut that out.\"(Laughter)That gets you about four million dead in Central Africa over the 1990s. That gets you 250,000 dead in the Sudan in the last 15 months. Everybody's got to answer their grandchildren some day what you did about the holocaust in Africa, and you better have an answer. We don't have anything to translate that will into action.What we do have is the U.S.-enabled Leviathan Force that says, \"You want me to take that guy down? I'll take that guy down. I'll do it on Tuesday. It will cost you 20 billion dollars.\"(Laughter)But here's the deal. As soon as I can't find anybody else to air out, I leave the scene immediately. That's called the Powell Doctrine. Way downstream we have the International Criminal Court. They love to put them on trial. They've got Milosevi\u0107 right now.What are we missing? A functioning executive that will translate will into action, because we don't have it. Every time we lead one of these efforts we have to whip ourselves into this imminent threat thing. We haven't faced an imminent threat since the Cuban missile crisis in 1962. But we use this language from a bygone era to scare ourselves into doing something because we're a democracy and that's what it takes. And if that doesn't work we scream, \"He's got a gun!\" just as we rush in.(Laughter)And then we look over the body and we find an old cigarette lighter and we say, \"Jesus, it was dark.\"(Laughter)Do you want to do it, France? France says, \"No, but I do like to criticize you after the fact.\"What we need downstream is a great power enabled \u2014 what I call that Sys Admin Force. We should have had 250,000 troops streaming into Iraq on the heels of that Leviathan sweeping towards Baghdad. What do you get then? No looting, no military disappearing, no arms disappearing, no ammo disappearing, no Muqtada Al-Sadr \u2014 I'm wrecking his bones \u2014 no insurgency. Talk to anybody who was over there in the first six months. We had six months to feel the lob, to get the job done, and we dicked around for six months. And then they turned on us. Why? Because they just got fed up. They saw what we did to Saddam. They said, \"You're that powerful, you can resurrect this country. You're America.\"What we need is an international reconstruction fund \u2014 Sebastian Mallaby, Washington Post, great idea. Model on the IMF. Instead of passing the hat each time, OK? Where are we going to find this guy? G20, that's easy. Check out their agenda since 9/11. All security dominated. They're going to decide up front how the money gets spent just like in the IMF. You vote according to how much money you put in the kitty. Here's my challenge to the Defense Department. You've got to build this force. You've got to seed this force. You've got to track coalition partners. Create a record of success. You will get this model. You tell me it's too hard to do. I'll walk this dog right through that six part series on the Balkans. We did it just like that. I'm talking about regularizing it, making it transparent. Would you like Mugabe gone? Would you like Kim Jong-Il, who's killed about two million people, would you like him gone? Would you like a better system? This is why it matters to the military. They've been experiencing an identity crisis since the end of the Cold War. I'm not talking about the difference between reality and desire, which I can do because I'm not inside the beltway.(Laughter)I'm talking about the 1990s. The Berlin Wall falls. We do Desert Storm. The split starts to emerge between those in the military who see a future they can live with, and those who see a future that starts to scare them, like the U.S. submarine community, which watches the Soviet Navy disappear overnight. Ah!(Laughter)So they start moving from reality towards desire and they create their own special language to describe their voyage of self-discovery and self-actualization.(Laughter)The problem is you need a big, sexy opponent to fight against. And if you can't find one you've got to make one up. China, all grown up, going to be a looker!(Laughter)The rest of the military got dragged down into the muck across the 1990s and they developed this very derisive term to describe it: military operations other than war. I ask you, who joins the military to do things other than war? Actually, most of them. Jessica Lynch never planned on shooting back. Most of them don't pick up a rifle. I maintain this is code inside the Army for, \"We don't want to do this.\" They spent the 1990s working the messy scene between globalized parts of the world What I call the core and the gap. The Clinton administration wasn't interested in running this. For eight years, after screwing up the relationship on day one \u2014 inauguration day with gays in the military \u2014 which was deft.(Laughter)So we were home alone for eight years. And what did we do home alone? We bought one military and we operated another. It's like the guy who goes to the doctor and says, \"Doctor, it hurts when I do this.\"(Laughter)The doctor says, \"Stop doing that you idiot.\"I used to give this brief inside the Pentagon in the early 1990s. I'd say, \"You're buying one military and you're operating another, and eventually it's going to hurt. It's wrong. Bad Pentagon, bad!\"(Laughter)And they'd say, \"Dr. Barnett, you are so right. Can you come back next year and remind us again?\"(Laughter)Some people say 9/11 heals the rift \u2014 jerks the long-term transformation gurus out of their 30,000 foot view of history, drags them down in to the muck and says, \"You want a networked opponent? I've got one, he's everywhere, go find him.\" It elevates MOOTW \u2014 how we pronounce that acronym \u2014 from crap to grand strategy, because that's how you're going to shrink that gap.Some people put these two things together and they call it empire, which I think is a boneheaded concept. Empire is about the enforcement of not just minimal rule sets, which you cannot do, but maximum rule sets which you must do. It's not our system of governance. Never how we've sought to interact with the outside world. I prefer that phrase System Administration. We enforce the minimal rule sets for maintaining connectivity to the global economy. Certain bad things you cannot do. How this impacts the way we think about the future of war. This is a concept which gets me vilified throughout the Pentagon. It makes me very popular as well. Everybody's got an opinion.Going back to the beginning of our country \u2014 historically, defenses meant protection of the homeland. Security has meant everything else. Written into our constitution, two different forces, two different functions. Raise an army when you need it, and maintain a navy for day-to-day connectivity. A Department of War, a Department of Everything Else. A big stick, a baton stick. Can of whup ass, the networking force. In 1947 we merged these two things together in the Defense Department. Our long-term rationale becomes, we're involved in a hair trigger stand off with the Soviets. To attack America is to risk blowing up the world. We connected national security to international security with about a seven minute time delay. That's not our problem now. They can kill three million in Chicago tomorrow and we don't go to the mattresses with nukes. That's the scary part.The question is how do we reconnect American national security with global security to make the world a lot more comfortable, and to embed and contextualize our employment of force around the planet? What's happened since is that bifurcation I described. We talked about this going all the way back to the end of the Cold War. Let's have a Department of War, and a Department of Something Else. Some people say, \"Hell, 9/11 did it for you.\" Now we've got a home game and an away game.(Laughter)The Department of Homeland Security is a strategic feel good measure. It's going to be the Department of Agriculture for the 21st century. TSA \u2014 thousands standing around.(Laughter)I supported the war in Iraq. He was a bad guy with multiple priors. It's not like we had to find him actually killing somebody live to arrest him. I knew we'd kick ass in the war with the Leviathan Force. I knew we'd have a hard time with what followed. But I know this organization doesn't change until it experiences failure. What do I mean by these two different forces?This is the Hobbesian Force. I love this force. I don't want to see it go. That plus nukes rules out great power war. This is the military the rest of the world wants us to build. It's why I travel all over the world talking to foreign militaries.What does this mean? It means you've got to stop pretending you can do these two very disparate skill sets with the same 19-year-old. Switching back, morning, afternoon, evening, morning, afternoon, evening. Handing out aid, shooting back, handing out aid, shooting back. It's too much. The 19-year-olds get tired from the switching, OK?(Laughter)That force on the left, you can train a 19-year-old to do that. That force on the right is more like a 40-year-old cop. You need the experience. What does this mean in terms of operations?The rule is going to be this. That Sys Admin force is the force that never comes home, does most of your work. You break out that Leviathan Force only every so often. But here's the promise you make to the American public, to your own people, to the world. You break out that Leviathan Force, you promise, you guarantee that you're going to mount one hell of a \u2014 immediately \u2014 follow-on Sys Admin effort. Don't plan for the war unless you plan to win the peace.(Applause)Other differences. Leviathan traditional partners, they all look like the Brits and their former colonies.(Laughter)Including us, I would remind you. The rest \u2014 wider array of partners. International organizations, non-governmental organizations, private voluntary organizations, contractors. You're not going to get away from that. Leviathan Force, it's all about joint operations between the military services. We're done with that. What we need to do is inter-agency operations, which frankly Condi Rice was in charge of. And I'm amazed nobody asked her that question when she was confirmed.I call the Leviathan Force your dad's military. I like them young, male, unmarried, slightly pissed off.(Laughter)I call the Sys Admin Force your mom's military. It's everything the man's military hates. Gender balanced much more, older, educated, married with children. The force on the left, up or out. The force on the right, in and out. The force on the left respects Posse Comitatus restrictions on the use of force inside the U.S. The force on the right's going to obliterate it. That's where the National Guard's going to be. The force on the left is never coming under the purview of the International Criminal Court. Sys Admin Force has to. Different definitions of network centricity. One takes down networks, one puts them up. And you've got to wage war here in such a way to facilitate that.Do we need a bigger budget? Do we need a draft to pull this off? Absolutely not. I've been told by the Revolution of Military Affairs crowd for years, we can do it faster, cheaper, smaller, just as lethal. I say, \"Great, I'm going to take the Sys Admin budget out of your hide.\"Here's the larger point. You're going to build the Sys Admin Force inside the U.S. Military first. But ultimately you're going to civilianize it, probably two thirds. Inter agency-ize it, internationalize it. So yes, it begins inside the Pentagon, but over time it's going to cross that river.(Laughter)I have been to the mountain top. I can see the future. I may not live long enough to get you there, but it's going to happen. We're going to have a Department of Something Else between war and peace.Last slide. Who gets custody of the kids? This is where the Marines in the audience get kind of tense. (Laughter) And this is when they think about beating the crap out of me after the talk.(Laughter)Read Max Boon. This is the history of the marines \u2014 small wars, small arms. The Marines are like my West Highland Terrier. They get up every morning, they want to dig a hole and they want to kill something.(Laughter)I don't want my Marines handing out aid. I want them to be Marines. That's what keeps the Sys Admin Force from being a pussy force. It keeps it from being the U.N. You shoot at these people the Marines are going to come over and kill you.(Laughter)(Applause)Department of Navy, strategic subs go this way, surface combatants are over there, and the news is they may actually be that small.(Laughter)I call it the Smart Dust Navy. I tell young officers, \"You may command 500 ships in your career. Bad news is they may not have anybody on them.\" Carriers go both ways because they're a swing asset. You'll see the pattern \u2014 airborne, just like carriers. Armor goes this way. Here's the dirty secret of the Air Force, you can win by bombing. But you need lots of these guys on the ground to win the peace. Shinseki was right with the argument. Air force, strategic airlift goes both ways. Bombers, fighters go over here. Special Operations Command down at Tampa. Trigger-pullers go this way. Civil Affairs, that bastard child, comes over here. Return to the Army. The point about the trigger-pullers and Special Operations Command. No off season, these guys are always active. They drop in, do their business, disappear. See me now. Don't talk about it later.(Laughter)I was never here.(Laughter)The world is my playground.(Laughter)I want to keep trigger-pullers trigger-happy. I want the rules to be as loose as possible. Because when the thing gets prevented in Chicago with the three million dead that perverts our political system beyond all recognition, these are the guys who are going to kill them first. So it's better off to have them make some mistakes along the way than to see that.Reserve component \u2014 National Guard reserves overwhelmingly Sys Admin. How are you going to get them to work for this force? Most firemen in this country do it for free. This is not about money. This is about being up front with these guys and gals.Last point, intelligence community \u2014 the muscle and the defense agencies go this way. What should be the CIA, open, analytical, open source should come over here. The information you need to do this is not secret. It's not secret. Read that great piece in the New Yorker about how our echo boomers, 19 to 25, over in Iraq taught each other how to do Sys Admin work, over the Internet in chat rooms. They said, \"Al Qaeda could be listening.\" They said, \"Well, Jesus, they already know this stuff.\"(Laughter)Take a gift in the left hand. These are the sunglasses that don't scare people, simple stuff. Censors and transparency, the overheads go in both directions.Thanks.", "id": 33, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:12.958 --> 00:00:15.625\nI get asked a

Secretary of Defense,\n\n00:00:50.958 --> 00:00:53.934\nthinking about a new\nnational grand strategy\n\n00:00:53.958 --> 00:00:55.108\nfor the United States.\n\n00:00:55.784 --> 00:00:57.213\nI'm going to present a problem\n\n00:00:57.237 --> 00:00:59.237\nand try to give you an answer.\n\n00:00:59.958 --> 00:01:03.934\nHere's my favorite bonehead concept\nfrom the 1990s in the Pentagon:\n\n00:01:03.958 --> 00:01:07.934\nthe theory of anti-access,\narea-denial asymmetrical strategies.\n\n00:01:07.958 --> 00:01:08.934\nWhy do we call it that?\n\n00:01:08.958 --> 00:01:12.958\nBecause it's got all those\nA's lined up I guess.\n\n00:01:16.958 --> 00:01:18.934\nThis is gobbledygook for\n\n00:01:18.958 --> 00:01:21.934\nif the United States fights\nsomebody we're going to be huge.\n\n00:01:21.958 --> 00:01:22.934\nThey're going to be small.\n\n00:01:22.958 --> 00:01:24.934\nAnd if they try to fight us\nin the traditional, straight-up manner\n\n00:01:24.958 --> 00:01:25.934\nwe're going to kick their ass,\n\n00:01:25.958 --> 00:01:28.934\nwhich is why people don't\ntry to do that any more.\n\n00:01:28.958 --> 00:01:31.934\nI met the last Air Force\nGeneral who had actually\n\n00:01:31.958 --> 00:01:33.934\nshot down an enemy plane in combat.\n\n00:01:33.958 --> 00:01:35.934\nHe's now a one star General.\n\n00:01:35.958 --> 00:01:39.934\nThat's how distant\nwe are from even meeting an air force\n\n00:01:39.958 --> 00:01:41.934\nwilling to fly against ours.\n\n00:01:41.958 --> 00:01:44.934\nSo that overmatched capability\ncreates problems --\n\n00:01:44.958 --> 00:01:47.934\ncatastrophic successes\nthe White House calls them.\n\n00:01:47.958 --> 00:01:50.934\n(Laughter)\n\n00:01:50.958 --> 00:01:52.934\nAnd we're trying to figure that out,\n\n00:01:52.958 --> 00:01:54.934\nbecause it is an amazing capability.\n\n00:01:54.958 --> 00:01:57.934\nThe question is, what's the good\nyou can do with it?\n\n00:01:57.958 --> 00:01:59.934\nOK?\n\n00:01:59.958 --> 00:02:03.934\nThe theory of anti-access, area-denial\nasymmetrical strategies --\n\n00:02:03.958 --> 00:02:05.934\ngobbledygook that we sell to Congress,\n\n00:02:05.958 --> 00:02:08.934\nbecause if we just told them\nwe can kick anybody's asses\n\n00:02:08.958 --> 00:02:11.006\nthey wouldn't buy us\nall the stuff we want.\n\n00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:14.934\nSo we say, area-denial, anti-access\nasymmetrical strategies\n\n00:02:14.958 --> 00:02:16.934\nand their eyes glaze over.\n\n00:02:16.958 --> 00:02:19.934\n(Laughter)\n\n00:02:19.958 --> 00:02:22.934\nAnd they say, \"Will you\nbuild it in my district?\"\n\n00:02:22.958 --> 00:02:24.934\n(Laughter)\n\n00:02:24.958 --> 00:02:28.934\n(Applause)\n\n00:02:28.958 --> 00:02:29.934\nHere's my parody and it ain't much of one.\n\n00:02:29.958 --> 00:02:30.934\nLet's talk about a battle space.\n\n00:02:30.958 --> 00:02:32.934\nI don't know, Taiwan Straits 2025.\n\n00:02:32.958 --> 00:02:35.934\nLet's talk about an enemy embedded\nwithin that battle space.\n\n00:02:35.958 --> 00:02:37.934\nI don't know, the Million Man Swim.\n\n00:02:37.958 --> 00:02:40.934\n(Laughter)\n\n00:02:40.958 --> 00:02:44.101\nThe United States has to access\nthat battle space instantaneously.\n\n00:02:44.125 --> 00:02:47.934\nThey throw up anti-access,\narea-denial asymmetrical strategies.\n\n00:02:47.958 --> 00:02:49.934\nA banana peel on the tarmac.\n\n00:02:49.958 --> 00:02:50.934\n(Laughter)\n\n00:02:50.958 --> 00:02:52.934\nTrojan horses on our computer networks\n\n00:02:52.958 --> 00:02:55.934\nreveal all our Achilles' heels instantly.\n\n00:02:55.958 --> 00:02:57.934\nWe say, \"China, it's yours.\"\n\n00:02:57.958 --> 00:03:00.934\nPrometheus approach, largely\na geographic definition,\n\n00:03:00.958 --> 00:03:02.934\nfocuses almost exclusively\non the start of conflict.\n\n00:03:02.958 --> 00:03:04.934\nWe field the first-half team in a league\n\n00:03:04.958 --> 00:03:07.934\nthat insists on keeping score\nuntil the end of the game.\n\n00:03:07.958 --> 00:03:09.934\nThat's the problem.\n\n00:03:09.958 --> 00:03:11.934\nWe can run the score up against anybody,\n\n00:03:11.958 --> 00:03:14.387\nand then get our asses\nkicked in the second half --\n\n00:03:14.411 --> 00:03:16.934\nwhat they call fourth generation warfare.\n\n00:03:16.958 --> 00:03:19.101\nHere's the way\nI like to describe it instead.\n\n00:03:19.125 --> 00:03:21.934\nThere is no battle space the U.S.\nMilitary cannot access.\n\n00:03:21.958 --> 00:03:23.934\nThey said we couldn't do Afghanistan.\nWe did it with ease.\n\n00:03:23.958 --> 00:03:25.934\nThey said we couldn't do Iraq.\n\n00:03:25.958 --> 00:03:29.934\nWe did it with 150 combat\ncasualties in six weeks.\n\n00:03:29.958 --> 00:03:33.934\nWe did it so fast we weren't\nprepared for their collapse.\n\n00:03:33.958 --> 00:03:36.934\nThere is nobody we can't take down.\n\n00:03:36.958 --> 00:03:38.934\nThe question is, what do\nyou do with the power?\n\n00:03:38.958 --> 00:03:41.149\nSo there's no trouble\naccessing battle spaces.\n\n00:03:41.173 --> 00:03:43.934\nWhat we have trouble accessing\nis the transition space\n\n00:03:43.958 --> 00:03:45.934\nthat must naturally follow,\n\n00:03:45.958 --> 00:03:48.958\nand creating the peace space\nthat allows us to move on.\n\n00:03:49.958 --> 00:03:52.054\nProblem is, the Defense\nDepartment over here\n\n00:03:52.078 --> 00:03:54.078\nbeats the hell out of you.\n\n00:03:54.784 --> 00:03:56.499\nThe State Department over here says,\n\n00:03:56.523 --> 00:03:58.523\n\"Come on boy, I know you can make it.\"\n\n00:03:58.934 --> 00:04:00.934\nAnd that poor country runs off that ledge,\n\n00:04:00.958 --> 00:04:02.934\ndoes that cartoon thing and then drops.\n\n00:04:02.958 --> 00:04:08.934\n(Laughter)\n\n00:04:08.958 --> 00:04:10.934\nThis is not about overwhelming\nforce, but proportional force.\n\n00:04:10.958 --> 00:04:12.934\nIt's about non-lethal technologies,\n\n00:04:12.958 --> 00:04:15.934\nbecause if you fire real ammo into a crowd\n\n00:04:15.958 --> 00:04:17.958\nof women and children rioting\n\n00:04:18.934 --> 00:04:20.934\nyou're going to lose friends very quickly.\n\n00:04:20.958 --> 00:04:23.816\nThis is not about projecting\npower, but about staying power,\n\n00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:25.934\nwhich is about legitimacy with the locals.\n\n00:04:25.958 --> 00:04:28.006\nWho do you access in this\ntransition space?\n\n00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:31.650\nYou have to create internal partners.\nYou have to access coalition partners.\n\n00:04:31.674 --> 00:04:33.934\nWe asked the Indians\nfor 17,000 peace keepers.\n\n00:04:33.958 --> 00:04:36.934\nI know their senior leadership,\nthey wanted to give it to us.\n\n00:04:36.958 --> 00:04:38.934\nBut they said to us, \"You know what?\n\n00:04:38.958 --> 00:04:41.958\nIn that transition space you're\nmostly hat not enough cattle.\n\n00:04:42.784 --> 00:04:43.934\nWe don't think you can pull it off,\n\n00:04:43.958 --> 00:04:45.934\nwe're not going to give you\nour 17,000 peace keepers for fodder.\"\n\n00:04:45.958 --> 00:04:48.934\nWe asked the Russians for 40,000.\n\n00:04:48.958 --> 00:04:49.934\nThey said no.\n\n00:04:49.958 --> 00:04:50.934\nI was in China in August, I said,\n\n00:04:50.958 --> 00:04:53.934\n\"You should have 50,000\npeace keepers in Iraq.\n\n00:04:53.958 --> 00:04:55.958\nIt's your oil, not ours.\"\n\n00:04:56.958 --> 00:04:58.934\nWhich is the truth. It's their oil.\n\n00:04:58.958 --> 00:05:02.101\nAnd the Chinese said to me, \"Dr.\nBarnett, you're absolutely right.\n\n00:05:02.125 --> 00:05:04.934\nIn a perfect world we'd have 50,000 there.\n\n00:05:04.958 --> 00:05:06.934\nBut it's not a perfect world,\n\n00:05:06.958 --> 00:05:09.958\nand your administration isn't\ngetting us any closer.\"\n\n00:05:10.958 --> 00:05:13.006\nBut we have trouble\naccessing our outcomes.\n\n00:05:13.958 --> 00:05:15.934\nWe lucked out, frankly, on the selection.\n\n00:05:15.958 --> 00:05:18.934\nWe face different opponents\nacross these three.\n\n00:05:18.958 --> 00:05:19.934\nAnd it's time to start admitting\n\n00:05:19.958 --> 00:05:23.934\nyou can't ask the same 19-year-old\nto do it all, day in and day out.\n\n00:05:23.958 --> 00:05:25.934\nIt's just too damn hard.\n\n00:05:25.958 --> 00:05:28.958\nWe have an unparalleled\ncapacity to wage war.\n\n00:05:29.958 --> 00:05:32.934\nWe don't do the everything else so well.\n\n00:05:32.958 --> 00:05:34.934\nFrankly, we do it better than anybody\nand we still suck at it.\n\n00:05:34.958 --> 00:05:36.934\nWe have a brilliant Secretary of War.\n\n00:05:36.958 --> 00:05:39.934\nWe don't have a Secretary\nof Everything Else.\n\n00:05:39.958 --> 00:05:42.816\nBecause if we did, that guy\nwould be in front of the Senate,\n\n00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:44.934\nstill testifying over Abu Ghraib.\n\n00:05:44.958 --> 00:05:47.934\nThe problem is he doesn't exist.\n\n00:05:47.958 --> 00:05:49.958\nThere is no Secretary of Everything Else.\n\n00:05:50.958 --> 00:05:53.934\nI think we have an unparalleled\ncapacity to wage war.\n\n00:05:53.958 --> 00:05:55.934\nI call that the Leviathan Force.\n\n00:05:55.958 --> 00:05:57.934\nWhat we need to build is a force\nfor the Everything Else.\n\n00:05:57.958 --> 00:05:59.934\nI call them the System Administrators.\n\n00:05:59.958 --> 00:06:01.934\nWhat I think this really represents\n\n00:06:01.958 --> 00:06:03.934\nis lack of an A to Z rule set\nfor the world as a whole\n\n00:06:03.958 --> 00:06:06.006\nfor processing politically\nbankrupt states.\n\n00:06:06.030 --> 00:06:08.934\nWe have one for processing\neconomically bankrupt states.\n\n00:06:08.958 --> 00:06:12.934\nIt's the IMF Sovereign\nBankruptcy Plan, OK?\n\n00:06:12.958 --> 00:06:14.934\nWe argue about it every time we use it.\n\n00:06:14.958 --> 00:06:16.934\nArgentina just went through it,\nbroke a lot of rules.\n\n00:06:16.958 --> 00:06:20.149\nThey got out on the far end, we said,\n\"Fine, don't worry about it.\"\n\n00:06:20.173 --> 00:06:22.934\nIt's transparent.

--> 00:10:52.934\nand those who see a future\nthat starts to scare them,\n\n00:10:52.958 --> 00:10:54.934\nlike the U.S. submarine community,\n\n00:10:54.958 --> 00:10:57.339\nwhich watches the

desire\n\n00:11:04.958 --> 00:11:06.958\nand they create their own special language\n\n00:11:06.982 --> 00:11:10.125\nto describe their voyage of self-discovery\nand self-actualization.\n\n00:11:10.149 --> 00:11:12.934\n(Laughter)\n\n00:11:12.958 --> 00:11:14.934\nThe problem is you need a big,\nsexy opponent to fight against.\n\n00:11:14.958 --> 00:11:17.435\nAnd if you can't find\none you've got to make one up.\n\n00:11:17.459 --> 00:11:19.934\nChina, all grown up, going to be a looker!\n\n00:11:19.958 --> 00:11:23.934\n(Laughter)\n\n00:11:23.958 --> 00:11:25.934\nThe rest of the military got\ndragged down into the muck\n\n00:11:25.958 --> 00:11:26.934\nacross the 1990s\n\n00:11:26.958 --> 00:11:29.720\nand they developed this very\nderisive term to describe it:\n\n00:11:29.744 --> 00:11:31.744\nmilitary operations other than war.\n\n00:11:31.958 --> 00:11:34.911\nI ask you, who joins the military\nto do things other than war?\n\n00:11:34.935 --> 00:11:36.934\nActually, most of them.\n\n00:11:36.958 --> 00:11:39.934\nJessica Lynch never\nplanned on shooting back.\n\n00:11:39.958 --> 00:11:41.958\nMost of them don't pick up a rifle.\n\n00:11:43.958 --> 00:11:46.054\nI maintain this is code\ninside the Army for,\n\n00:11:46.078 --> 00:11:49.078\n\"We don't want to do this.\"\n\n00:11:49.958 --> 00:11:52.054\nThey spent the 1990s\nworking the messy scene\n\n00:11:52.078 --> 00:11:53.934\nbetween globalized parts of the world\n\n00:11:53.958 --> 00:11:57.958\nWhat I call the core and the gap.\n\n00:11:58.958 --> 00:12:00.934\nThe Clinton administration wasn't\ninterested in running this.\n\n00:12:00.958 --> 00:12:02.934\nFor eight years, after screwing\nup the relationship on day one --\n\n00:12:02.958 --> 00:12:05.934\ninauguration day with gays\nin the military --\n\n00:12:05.958 --> 00:12:07.934\nwhich was deft.\n\n00:12:07.958 --> 00:12:09.934\n(Laughter)\n\n00:12:09.958 --> 00:12:11.934\nSo we were home alone for eight years.\n\n00:12:11.958 --> 00:12:13.934\nAnd what did we do home alone?\n\n00:12:13.958 --> 00:12:16.197\nWe bought one military\nand we operated another.\n\n00:12:16.221 --> 00:12:18.602\nIt's like the guy who goes\nto the doctor and says,\n\n00:12:18.626 --> 00:12:20.934\n\"Doctor, it hurts when I do this.\"\n\n00:12:20.958 --> 00:12:23.934\n(Laughter)\n\n00:12:23.958 --> 00:12:26.934\nThe doctor says, \"Stop\ndoing that you idiot.\"\n\n00:12:26.958 --> 00:12:28.934\nI used to give this brief\ninside the Pentagon in the early 1990s.\n\n00:12:28.958 --> 00:12:30.934\nI'd say, \"You're buying one military\nand you're operating another,\n\n00:12:30.958 --> 00:12:33.149\nand eventually it's going to hurt.\nIt's wrong.\n\n00:12:33.173 --> 00:12:34.934\nBad Pentagon, bad!\"\n\n00:12:34.958 --> 00:12:36.934\n(Laughter)\n\n00:12:36.958 --> 00:12:39.197\nAnd they'd say, \"Dr.\nBarnett, you are so right.\n\n00:12:39.221 --> 00:12:41.555\nCan you come back next year\nand remind us again?\"\n\n00:12:41.579 --> 00:12:46.934\n(Laughter)\n\n00:12:46.958 --> 00:12:48.934\nSome people say 9/11 heals the rift --\n\n00:12:48.958 --> 00:12:51.934\njerks the long-term transformation gurus\n\n00:12:51.958 --> 00:12:53.934\nout of their 30,000 foot view of history,\n\n00:12:53.958 --> 00:12:55.934\ndrags them down in to the muck and says,\n\"You want a networked opponent?\n\n00:12:55.958 --> 00:12:58.934\nI've got one, he's everywhere,\ngo find him.\"\n\n00:12:58.958 --> 00:13:01.934\nIt elevates MOOTW --\nhow we pronounce that acronym --\n\n00:13:01.958 --> 00:13:04.934\nfrom crap to grand strategy,\n\n00:13:04.958 --> 00:13:06.934\nbecause that's how you're\ngoing to shrink that gap.\n\n00:13:06.958 --> 00:13:07.934\nSome people put these two things together\n\n00:13:07.958 --> 00:13:10.958\nand they call it empire, which I think\nis a boneheaded concept.\n\n00:13:10.982 --> 00:13:13.935\nEmpire is about the enforcement\nof not just minimal rule sets,\n\n00:13:13.959 --> 00:13:14.934\nwhich you cannot do,\n\n00:13:14.958 --> 00:13:16.934\nbut maximum rule sets which you must do.\n\n00:13:16.958 --> 00:13:18.934\nIt's not our system of governance.\n\n00:13:18.958 --> 00:13:20.934\nNever how we've sought to interact\nwith the outside world.\n\n00:13:20.958 --> 00:13:23.006\nI prefer that phrase\nSystem Administration.\n\n00:13:23.030 --> 00:13:24.934\nWe enforce the minimal rule sets\n\n00:13:24.958 --> 00:13:27.387\nfor maintaining connectivity\nto the global economy.\n\n00:13:27.411 --> 00:13:29.411\nCertain bad things you cannot do.\n\n00:13:31.958 --> 00:13:33.934\nHow this impacts the way we think\nabout the future of war.\n\n00:13:33.958 --> 00:13:37.054\nThis is a concept which gets me\nvilified throughout the Pentagon.\n\n00:13:37.078 --> 00:13:38.934\nIt makes me very popular as well.\n\n00:13:38.958 --> 00:13:40.934\nEverybody's got an opinion.\n\n00:13:40.958 --> 00:13:43.101\nGoing back to the beginning\nof our country --\n\n00:13:43.125 --> 00:13:46.125\nhistorically, defenses meant\nprotection of the homeland.\n\n00:13:46.958 --> 00:13:49.934\nSecurity has meant everything else.\n\n00:13:49.958 --> 00:13:51.934\nWritten into our constitution,\n\n00:13:51.958 --> 00:13:54.934\ntwo different forces,\ntwo different functions.\n\n00:13:54.958 --> 00:13:56.934\nRaise an army when you need it,\n\n00:13:56.958 --> 00:14:01.934\nand maintain a navy\nfor day-to-day connectivity.\n\n00:14:01.958 --> 00:14:05.934\nA Department of War,\na Department of Everything Else.\n\n00:14:05.958 --> 00:14:08.958\nA big stick, a baton stick.\n\n00:14:09.958 --> 00:14:11.958\nCan of whup ass,\n\n00:14:12.958 --> 00:14:14.934\nthe networking force.\n\n00:14:14.958 --> 00:14:17.006\nIn 1947 we merged these\ntwo things together\n\n00:14:17.030 --> 00:14:18.934\nin the Defense Department.\n\n00:14:18.958 --> 00:14:20.934\nOur long-term rationale becomes,\n\n00:14:20.958 --> 00:14:23.934\nwe're involved in a hair trigger\nstand off with the Soviets.\n\n00:14:23.958 --> 00:14:26.934\nTo attack America is to risk\nblowing up the

global security to make\nthe world a lot more comfortable,\n\n00:14:51.958 --> 00:14:54.934\nand to embed and contextualize\nour employment\n\n00:14:54.958 --> 00:14:56.958\nof force around the

00:15:52.471\nI knew we'd kick ass in the war\nwith the Leviathan Force.\n\n00:15:52.495 --> 00:15:54.780\nI knew we'd have a hard\ntime with what followed.\n\n00:15:54.804 --> 00:15:58.281\nBut I know this organization doesn't\nchange until it experiences failure.\n\n00:15:58.804 --> 00:16:00.947\nWhat do I mean by these\ntwo different forces?\n\n00:16:01.804 --> 00:16:03.780\nThis is the

I don't\nwant to see it go.\n\n00:16:05.804 --> 00:16:07.780\nThat plus nukes rules out great power war.\n\n00:16:07.804 --> 00:16:09.780\nThis is the military the rest\nof the world wants us to build.\n\n00:16:09.804 --> 00:16:12.995\nIt's why I travel all over the world\ntalking to foreign militaries.\n\n00:16:13.019 --> 00:16:15.780\nWhat does this mean?\n\n00:16:15.804 --> 00:16:17.780\nIt means you've got to stop pretending\n\n00:16:17.804 --> 00:16:21.281\nyou can do these two very disparate\nskill sets with the same 19-year-old.\n\n00:16:21.305 --> 00:16:23.780\nSwitching back, morning,\nafternoon, evening,\n\n00:16:23.804 --> 00:16:25.780\nmorning, afternoon, evening.\n\n00:16:25.804 --> 00:16:27.780\nHanding out aid, shooting back,\n\n00:16:27.804 --> 00:16:29.780\nhanding out aid, shooting back.\n\n00:16:29.804 --> 00:16:31.780\nIt's too much.\n\n00:16:31.804 --> 00:16:34.780\nThe 19-year-olds get tired\nfrom the switching, OK?\n\n00:16:34.804 --> 00:16:36.780\n(Laughter)\n\n00:16:36.804 --> 00:16:39.804\nThat force on the left, you can\ntrain a 19-year-old to do that.\n\n00:16:39.828 --> 00:16:42.780\nThat force on the right is more\nlike a 40-year-old cop.\n\n00:16:42.804 --> 00:16:44.804\nYou need the experience.\n\n00:16:45.804 --> 00:16:47.852\nWhat does this mean\nin terms of operations?\n\n00:16:49.804 --> 00:16:51.804\nThe rule is going to be this.\n\n00:16:52.804 --> 00:16:55.780\nThat Sys Admin force is the force\nthat never comes home,\n\n00:16:55.804 --> 00:16:57.780\ndoes most of your work.\n\n00:16:57.804 --> 00:17:00.780\nYou break out that Leviathan\nForce only every so often.\n\n00:17:00.804 --> 00:17:02.780\nBut here's the promise you\nmake to the American public,\n\n00:17:02.804 --> 00:17:04.780\nto your own people, to the world.\n\n00:17:04.804 --> 00:17:06.780\nYou break out that Leviathan Force,\n\n00:17:06.804 --> 00:17:09.780\nyou promise, you guarantee\nthat you're going to mount\n\n00:17:09.804 --> 00:17:13.780\none hell of a -- immediately\n-- follow-on Sys Admin effort.\n\n00:17:13.804 --> 00:17:16.471\nDon't plan for the war unless you\nplan to win the peace.\n\n00:17:16.495 --> 00:17:21.780\n(Applause)\n\n00:17:21.804 --> 00:17:23.780\nOther differences.

that.\n\n00:17:44.804 --> 00:17:47.780\nWhat we need to do\nis inter-agency operations,\n\n00:17:47.804 --> 00:17:49.804\nwhich frankly Condi Rice was in charge of.\n\n00:17:49.828 --> 00:17:53.114\nAnd I'm amazed nobody asked her\nthat question when she was confirmed.\n\n00:17:53.138 --> 00:17:55.780\nI call the Leviathan Force\nyour dad's military.\n\n00:17:55.804 -->

that.\n\n00:18:47.804 --> 00:18:49.780\nDo we need a bigger budget?\n\n00:18:49.804 --> 00:18:52.780\nDo we need a draft to pull this off?\n\n00:18:52.804 --> 00:18:54.804\nAbsolutely

00:19:11.780\nYou're going to build the Sys Admin\nForce inside the U.S. Military first.\n\n00:19:11.804 --> 00:19:15.780\nBut ultimately you're going\nto civilianize it, probably two thirds.\n\n00:19:15.804 --> 00:19:19.780\nInter agency-ize it, internationalize it.\n\n00:19:19.804 --> 00:19:21.780\nSo yes, it begins inside the Pentagon,\n\n00:19:21.804 --> 00:19:24.780\nbut over

00:20:16.780\nIt keeps it from being the U.N.\n\n00:20:16.804 --> 00:20:18.780\nYou shoot at these people the Marines\nare going to come over and kill you.\n\n00:20:18.804 -->

What does this all mean for us? What it means is the Web is going to become an exciting place again. It's going to become super exciting as we transform to this highly immersive and interactive world. With graphics, computing power, low latencies, these types of applications and possibilities are going to stream rich data into your lives. So the Virtual Earth initiative, and other types of these initiatives, are all about extending our current search metaphor.When you think about it, we're so constrained by browsing the Web, remembering URLs, saving favorites. As we move to search, we rely on the relevance rankings, the Web matching, the index crawling. But we want to use our brain! We want to navigate, explore, discover information. In order to do that, we have to put you as a user back in the driver's seat. We need cooperation between you and the computing network and the computer.So what better way to put you back in the driver's seat than to put you in the real world that you interact in every day? Why not leverage the learnings that you've been learning your entire life? So Virtual Earth is about starting off creating the first digital representation, comprehensive, of the entire world. What we want to do is mix in all types of data. Tag it. Attribute it. Metadata. Get the community to add local depth, global perspective, local knowledge. So when you think about this problem, what an enormous undertaking. Where do you begin? Well, we collect data from satellites, from airplanes, from ground vehicles, from people. This process is an engineering problem, a mechanical problem, a logistical problem, an operational problem.Here is an example of our aerial camera. This is panchromatic. It's actually four color cones. In addition, it's multi-spectral. We collect four gigabits per second of data, if you can imagine that kind of data stream coming down. That's equivalent to a constellation of 12 satellites at highest res capacity. We fly these airplanes at 5,000 feet in the air. You can see the camera on the front. We collect multiple viewpoints, vantage points, angles, textures. We bring all that data back in.We sit here \u2014 you know, think about the ground vehicles, the human scale \u2014 what do you see in person? We need to capture that up close to establish that what it's like-type experience. I bet many of you have seen the Apple commercials, kind of poking at the PC for their brilliance and simplicity. So a little unknown secret is \u2014 did you see the one with the guy, he's got the Web cam? The poor PC guy. They're duct taping his head. They're just wrapping it on him. Well, a little unknown secret is his brother actually works on the Virtual Earth team. (Laughter). So they've got a little bit of a sibling rivalry thing going on here. But let me tell you \u2014 it doesn't affect his day job.We think a lot of good can come from this technology. This was after Katrina. We were the first commercial fleet of airplanes to be cleared into the disaster impact zone. We flew the area. We imaged it. We sent in people. We took pictures of interiors, disaster areas. We helped with the first responders, the search and rescue. Often the first time anyone saw what happened to their house was on Virtual Earth. We made it all freely available on the Web, just to \u2014 it was obviously our chance of helping out with the cause.When we think about how all this comes together, it's all about software, algorithms and math. You know, we capture this imagery but to build the 3-D models we need to do geo-positioning. We need to do geo-registering of the images. We have to bundle adjust them. Find tie points. Extract geometry from the images. This process is a very calculated process. In fact, it was always done manual. Hollywood would spend millions of dollars to do a small urban corridor for a movie because they'd have to do it manually. They'd drive the streets with lasers called LIDAR. They'd collected information with photos. They'd manually build each building. We do this all through software, algorithms and math \u2014 a highly automated pipeline creating these cities. We took a decimal point off what it cost to build these cities, and that's how we're going to be able to scale this out and make this reality a dream.We think about the user interface. What does it mean to look at it from multiple perspectives? An ortho-view, a nadir-view. How do you keep the precision of the fidelity of the imagery while maintaining the fluidity of the model? I'll wrap up by showing you the \u2014 this is a brand-new peek I haven't really shown into the lab area of Virtual Earth. What we're doing is \u2014 people like this a lot, this bird's eye imagery we work with. It's this high resolution data. But what we've found is they like the fluidity of the 3-D model. A child can navigate with an Xbox controller or a game controller.So here what we're trying to do is we bring the picture and project it into the 3-D model space. You can see all types of resolution. From here, I can slowly pan the image over. I can get the next image. I can blend and transition. By doing this I don't lose the original detail. In fact, I might be recording history. The freshness, the capacity. I can turn this image. I can look at it from multiple viewpoints and angles.What we're trying to do is build a virtual world. We hope that we can make computing a user model you're familiar with, and really derive insights from you, from all different directions. I thank you very much for your time.

I told you that the statistics of the world have not been made properly available. Because of that, we still have the old mindset of developing in industrialized countries, which is wrong. And that animated graphics can make a difference. Things are changing and today, on the United Nations Statistic Division Home Page, it says, by first of May, full access to the databases. (Applause) And if I could share the image with you on the screen. So three things have happened. U.N. opened their statistic databases, and we have a new version of the software up working as a beta on the net, so you don't have to download it any longer.And let me repeat what you saw last year. The bubbles are the countries. Here you have the fertility rate \u2014 the number of children per woman \u2014 and there you have the length of life in years. This is 1950 \u2014 those were the industrialized countries, those were developing countries. At that time there was a \"we\" and \"them.\" There was a huge difference in the world. But then it changed, and it went on quite well.And this is what happens. You can see how China is the red, big bubble. The blue there is India. And they go over all this \u2014 I'm going to try to be a little more serious this year in showing you how things really changed. And it's Africa that stands out as the problem down here, doesn't it? Large families still, and the HIV epidemic brought down the countries like this. This is more or less what we saw last year, and this is how it will go on into the future.And I will talk on, is this possible? Because you see now, I presented statistics that don't exist. Because this is where we are. Will it be possible that this will happen? I cover my lifetime here, you know? I expect to live 100 years. And this is where we are today. Now could we look here instead at the economic situation in the world? And I would like to show that against child survival. We'll swap the axis. Here you have child mortality \u2014 that is, survival \u2014 four kids dying there, 200 dying there. And this is GDP per capita on this axis. And this was 2007.And if I go back in time, I've added some historical statistics \u2014 here we go, here we go, here we go \u2014 not so much statistics 100 years ago. Some countries still had statistics. We are looking down in the archive, and when we are down into 1820, there is only Austria and Sweden that can produce numbers. (Laughter) But they were down here. They had 1,000 dollars per person per year. And they lost one-fifth of their kids before their first birthday.So this is what happens in the world, if we play the entire world. How they got slowly richer and richer, and they add statistics. Isn't it beautiful when they get statistics? You see the importance of that? And here, children don't live longer. The last century, 1870, was bad for the kids in Europe, because most of this statistics is Europe. It was only by the turn of the century that more than 90 percent of the children survived their first year. This is India coming up, with the first data from India. And this is the United States moving away here, earning more money. And we will soon see China coming up in the very far end corner here. And it moves up with Mao Tse-Tung getting health, not getting so rich. There he died, then Deng Xiaoping brings money. It moves this way over here. And the bubbles keep moving up there, and this is what the world looks like today. (Applause)Let us have a look at the United States. We have a function here \u2014 I can tell the world, \"Stay where you are.\" And I take the United States \u2014 we still want to see the background \u2014 I put them up like this, and now we go backwards. And we can see that the United States goes to the right of the mainstream. They are on the money side all the time. And down in 1915, the United States was a neighbor of India \u2014 present, contemporary India. And that means United States was richer, but lost more kids than India is doing today, proportionally. And look here \u2014 compare to the Philippines of today. The Philippines of today has almost the same economy as the United States during the First World War. But we have to bring United States forward quite a while to find the same health of the United States as we have in the Philippines. About 1957 here, the health of the United States is the same as the Philippines. And this is the drama of this world which many call globalized, is that Asia, Arabic countries, Latin America, are much more ahead in being healthy, educated, having human resources than they are economically.There's a discrepancy in what's happening today in the emerging economies. There now, social benefits, social progress, are going ahead of economical progress. And 1957 \u2014 the United States had the same economy as Chile has today. And how long do we have to bring United States to get the same health as Chile has today? I think we have to go, there \u2014 we have 2001, or 2002 \u2014 the United States has the same health as Chile. Chile's catching up! Within some years Chile may have better child survival than the United States. This is really a change, that you have this lag of more or less 30, 40 years' difference on the health.And behind the health is the educational level. And there's a lot of infrastructure things, and general human resources are there. Now we can take away this \u2014 and I would like to show you the rate of speed, the rate of change, how fast they have gone. And we go back to 1920, and I want to look at Japan. And I want to look at Sweden and the United States. And I'm going to stage a race here between this sort of yellowish Ford here and the red Toyota down there, and the brownish Volvo. (Laughter) And here we go. Here we go. The Toyota has a very bad start down here, you can see, and the United States Ford is going off-road there. And the Volvo is doing quite fine. This is the war. The Toyota got off track, and now the Toyota is coming on the healthier side of Sweden \u2014 can you see that? And they are taking over Sweden, and they are now healthier than Sweden. That's the part where I sold the Volvo and bought the Toyota. (Laughter) And now we can see that the rate of change was enormous in Japan. They really caught up.And this changes gradually. We have to look over generations to understand it. And let me show you my own sort of family history \u2014 we made these graphs here. And this is the same thing, money down there, and health, you know? And this is my family. This is Sweden, 1830, when my great-great-grandma was born. Sweden was like Sierra Leone today. And this is when great-grandma was born, 1863. And Sweden was like Mozambique. And this is when my grandma was born, 1891. She took care of me as a child, so I'm not talking about statistic now \u2014 now it's oral history in my family. That's when I believe statistics, when it's grandma-verified statistics. (Laughter) I think it's the best way of verifying historical statistics. Sweden was like Ghana. It's interesting to see the enormous diversity within sub-Saharan Africa. I told you last year, I'll tell you again, my mother was born in Egypt, and I \u2014 who am I? I'm the Mexican in the family. And my daughter, she was born in Chile, and the grand-daughter was born in Singapore, now the healthiest country on this Earth. It bypassed Sweden about two to three years ago, with better child survival. But they're very small, you know? They're so close to the hospital we can never beat them out in these forests. (Laughter) But homage to Singapore.Singapore is the best one. Now this looks also like a very good story. But it's not really that easy, that it's all a good story. Because I have to show you one of the other facilities. We can also make the color here represent the variable \u2014 and what am I choosing here? Carbon-dioxide emission, metric ton per capita. This is 1962, and United States was emitting 16 tons per person. And China was emitting 0.6, and India was emitting 0.32 tons per capita. And what happens when we moved on? Well, you see the nice story of getting richer and getting healthier \u2014 everyone did it at the cost of emission of carbon dioxide. There is no one who has done it so far. And we don't have all the updated data any longer, because this is really hot data today. And there we are, 2001.And in the discussion I attended with global leaders, you know, many say now the problem is that the emerging economies, they are getting out too much carbon dioxide. The Minister of the Environment of India said, \"Well, you were the one who caused the problem.\" The OECD countries \u2014 the high-income countries \u2014 they were the ones who caused the climate change. \"But we forgive you, because you didn't know it. But from now on, we count per capita. From now on we count per capita. And everyone is responsible for the per capita emission.\"This really shows you, we have not seen good economic and health progress anywhere in the world without destroying the climate. And this is really what has to be changed. I've been criticized for showing you a too positive image of the world, but I don't think it's like this. The world is quite a messy place. This we can call Dollar Street. Everyone lives on this street here. What they earn here \u2014 what number they live on \u2014 is how much they earn per day. This family earns about one dollar per day. We drive up the street here, we find a family here which earns about two to three dollars a day. And we drive away here \u2014 we find the first garden in the street, and they earn 10 to 50 dollars a day.And how do they live? If we look at the bed here, we can see that they sleep on a rug on the floor. This is what poverty line is \u2014 80 percent of the family income is just to cover the energy needs, the food for the day. This is two to five dollars. You have a bed. And here it's a much nicer bedroom, you can see. I lectured on this for Ikea, and they wanted to see the sofa immediately here. (Laughter) And this is the sofa, how it will emerge from there. And the interesting thing, when you go around here in the photo panorama, you see the family still sitting on the floor there. Although there is a sofa, if you watch in the kitchen, you can see that the great difference for women does not come between one to 10 dollars. It comes beyond here, when you really can get good working conditions in the family. And if you really want to see the difference, you look at the toilet over here. This can change. This can change. These are all pictures and images from Africa, and it can become much better. We can get out of poverty.My own research has not been in IT or anything like this. I spent 20 years in interviews with African farmers who were on the verge of famine. And this is the result of the farmers-needs research. The nice thing here is that you can't see who are the researchers in this picture. That's when research functions in poor societies \u2014 you must really live with the people.When you're in poverty, everything is about survival. It's about having food. And these two young farmers, they are girls now \u2014 because the parents are dead from HIV and AIDS \u2014 they discuss with a trained agronomist. This is one of the best agronomists in Malawi, Junatambe Kumbira, and he's discussing what sort of cassava they will plant \u2014 the best converter of sunshine to food that man has found. And they are very, very eagerly interested to get advice, and that's to survive in poverty. That's one context. Getting out of poverty. The women told us one thing. \"Get us technology. We hate this mortar, to stand hours and hours. Get us a mill so that we can mill our flour, then we will be able to pay for the rest ourselves.\" Technology will bring you out of poverty, but there's a need for a market to get away from poverty. And this woman is very happy now, bringing her products to the market. But she's very thankful for the public investment in schooling so she can count, and won't be cheated when she reaches the market. She wants her kid to be healthy, so she can go to the market and doesn't have to stay home. And she wants the infrastructure \u2014 it is nice with a paved road. It's also good with credit. Micro-credits gave her the bicycle, you know. And information will tell her when to go to market with which product. You can do this.I find my experience from 20 years of Africa is that the seemingly impossible is possible. Africa has not done bad. In 50 years they've gone from a pre-Medieval situation to a very decent 100-year-ago Europe, with a functioning nation and state. I would say that sub-Saharan Africa has done best in the world during the last 50 years. Because we don't consider where they came from. It's this stupid concept of developing countries that puts us, Argentina and Mozambique together 50 years ago, and says that Mozambique did worse. We have to know a little more about the world. I have a neighbor who knows 200 types of wine. He knows everything. He knows the name of the grape, the temperature and everything. I only know two types of wine \u2014 red and white. (Laughter) But my neighbor only knows two types of countries \u2014 industrialized and developing. And I know 200, I know about the small data. But you can do that. (Applause)But I have to get serious. And how do you get serious? You make a PowerPoint, you know? (Laughter) Homage to the Office package, no? What is this, what is this, what am I telling? I'm telling you that there are many dimensions of development. Everyone wants your pet thing. If you are in the corporate sector, you love micro-credit. If you are fighting in a non-governmental organization, you love equity between gender. Or if you are a teacher, you'll love UNESCO, and so on. On the global level, we have to have more than our own thing. We need everything. All these things are important for development, especially when you just get out of poverty and you should go towards welfare.Now, what we need to think about is, what is a goal for development, and what are the means for development? Let me first grade what are the most important means. Economic growth to me, as a public-health professor, is the most important thing for development because it explains 80 percent of survival. Governance. To have a government which functions \u2014 that's what brought California out of the misery of 1850. It was the government that made law function finally. Education, human resources are important. Health is also important, but not that much as a mean. Environment is important. Human rights is also important, but it just gets one cross.Now what about goals? Where are we going toward? We are not interested in money. Money is not a goal. It's the best mean, but I give it zero as a goal. Governance, well it's fun to vote in a little thing, but it's not a goal. And going to school, that's not a goal, it's a mean. Health I give two points. I mean it's nice to be healthy \u2014 at my age especially \u2014 you can stand here, you're healthy. And that's good, it gets two plusses. Environment is very, very crucial. There's nothing for the grandkid if you don't save up. But where are the important goals? Of course, it's human rights. Human rights is the goal, but it's not that strong of a mean for achieving development. And culture. Culture is the most important thing, I would say, because that's what brings joy to life. That's the value of living.So the seemingly impossible is possible. Even African countries can achieve this. And I've shown you the shot where the seemingly impossible is possible. And remember, please remember my main message, which is this: the seemingly impossible is possible. We can have a good world. I showed you the shots, I proved it in the PowerPoint, and I think I will convince you also by culture. (Laughter) (Applause) Bring me my sword! Sword swallowing is from ancient India. It's a cultural expression that for thousands of years has inspired human beings to think beyond the obvious. (Laughter) And I will now prove to you that the seemingly impossible is possible by taking this piece of steel \u2014 solid steel \u2014 this is the army bayonet from the Swedish Army, 1850, in the last year we had war. And it's all solid steel \u2014 you can hear here. And I'm going to take this blade of steel, and push it down through my body of blood and flesh, and prove to you that the seemingly impossible is possible. Can I request a moment of absolute silence?

They had 1,000 dollars per person per year.\n\n00:03:08.958 --> 00:03:11.958\nAnd they lost one-fifth of their kids before their first birthday.\n\n00:03:12.958 --> 00:03:15.958\nSo this is what happens in the world, if we play the entire world.\n\n00:03:15.958 --> 00:03:18.958\nHow they got slowly richer and richer,\n\n00:03:18.958 --> 00:03:19.958\nand they add statistics.\n\n00:03:19.958 --> 00:03:21.958\nIsn't it beautiful when they get statistics?\n\n00:03:21.958 --> 00:03:23.958\nYou see the importance of that?\n\n00:03:23.958 --> 00:03:25.958\nAnd here, children don't live longer.\n\n00:03:25.958 --> 00:03:29.958\nThe last century, 1870, was bad for the kids in Europe,\n\n00:03:29.958 --> 00:03:31.958\nbecause most of this statistics is Europe.\n\n00:03:31.958 --> 00:03:34.958\nIt was only by the turn of the century\n\n00:03:34.958 --> 00:03:37.958\nthat more than 90 percent of the children survived their first year.\n\n00:03:37.958 --> 00:03:40.958\nThis is India coming up, with the first data from India.\n\n00:03:40.958 --> 00:03:45.958\nAnd this is the United States moving away here, earning more money.\n\n00:03:45.958 --> 00:03:50.958\nAnd we will soon see China coming up in the very far end corner here.\n\n00:03:50.958 --> 00:03:52.958\nAnd it moves up with Mao Tse-Tung getting health,\n\n00:03:52.958 --> 00:03:53.958\nnot getting so rich.\n\n00:03:53.958 --> 00:03:56.958\nThere he died, then Deng Xiaoping brings money.\n\n00:03:56.958 --> 00:03:57.958\nIt moves this way over here.\n\n00:03:58.958 --> 00:04:00.958\nAnd the bubbles keep moving up there,\n\n00:04:00.958 --> 00:04:02.958\nand this is what the world looks like today.\n\n00:04:02.958 --> 00:04:08.958\n(Applause)\n\n00:04:08.958 --> 00:04:11.958\nLet us have a look at the United States.\n\n00:04:11.958 --> 00:04:14.958\nWe have a function here -- I can tell the world, \"Stay where you are.\"\n\n00:04:15.958 --> 00:04:18.958\nAnd I take the United States -- we still want to see the background --\n\n00:04:18.958 --> 00:04:21.958\nI put them up like this, and now we go backwards.\n\n00:04:21.958 --> 00:04:24.958\nAnd we can see that the United States\n\n00:04:24.958 --> 00:04:27.958\ngoes to the right of the mainstream.\n\n00:04:27.958 --> 00:04:29.958\nThey are on the money side all the time.\n\n00:04:30.958 --> 00:04:35.958\nAnd down in 1915, the United States was a neighbor of India --\n\n00:04:36.958 --> 00:04:38.958\npresent, contemporary India.\n\n00:04:38.958 --> 00:04:40.958\nAnd that means United States was richer,\n\n00:04:40.958 --> 00:04:44.958\nbut lost more kids than India is doing today, proportionally.\n\n00:04:45.958 --> 00:04:48.958\nAnd look here -- compare to the Philippines of today.\n\n00:04:48.958 --> 00:04:51.958\nThe Philippines of today has almost the same economy\n\n00:04:52.958 --> 00:04:54.958\nas the United States during the First World War.\n\n00:04:54.958 --> 00:04:58.958\nBut we have to bring United States forward quite a while\n\n00:04:58.958 --> 00:05:01.958\nto find the same health of the United States\n\n00:05:01.958 --> 00:05:02.958\nas we have in the Philippines.\n\n00:05:03.958 --> 00:05:06.958\nAbout 1957 here, the health of the United States\n\n00:05:06.958 --> 00:05:08.958\nis the same as the Philippines.\n\n00:05:08.958 --> 00:05:11.958\nAnd this is the drama of this world which many call globalized,\n\n00:05:11.958 --> 00:05:14.958\nis that Asia, Arabic countries, Latin America,\n\n00:05:14.958 --> 00:05:19.958\nare much more ahead in being healthy, educated,\n\n00:05:19.958 --> 00:05:22.958\nhaving human resources than they are economically.\n\n00:05:22.958 --> 00:05:24.958\nThere's a discrepancy in what's happening today\n\n00:05:24.958 --> 00:05:26.958\nin the emerging economies.\n\n00:05:26.958 --> 00:05:30.958\nThere now, social benefits, social progress,\n\n00:05:30.958 --> 00:05:33.958\nare going ahead of economical progress.\n\n00:05:33.958 --> 00:05:39.958\nAnd 1957 -- the United States had the same economy as Chile has today.\n\n00:05:40.958 --> 00:05:43.958\nAnd how long do we have to bring United States\n\n00:05:43.958 --> 00:05:45.958\nto get the same health as Chile has today?\n\n00:05:46.958 --> 00:05:51.958\nI think we have to go, there -- we have 2001, or 2002 --\n\n00:05:51.958 --> 00:05:53.958\nthe United States has the same health as Chile.\n\n00:05:53.958 --> 00:05:54.958\nChile's catching up!\n\n00:05:55.958 --> 00:05:57.958\nWithin some years Chile may have better child survival\n\n00:05:57.958 --> 00:05:59.958\nthan the United States.\n\n00:05:59.958 --> 00:06:02.958\nThis is really a change, that you have this lag\n\n00:06:02.958 --> 00:06:07.958\nof more or less 30, 40 years' difference on the health.\n\n00:06:07.958 --> 00:06:09.958\nAnd behind the health is the educational level.\n\n00:06:09.958 --> 00:06:11.958\nAnd there's a lot of infrastructure things,\n\n00:06:11.958 --> 00:06:14.958\nand general human resources are there.\n\n00:06:14.958 --> 00:06:17.958\nNow we can take away this --\n\n00:06:17.958 --> 00:06:21.958\nand I would like to show you the rate of speed,\n\n00:06:21.958 --> 00:06:24.958\nthe rate of change, how fast they have gone.\n\n00:06:24.958 --> 00:06:31.958\nAnd we go back to 1920, and I want to look at Japan.\n\n00:06:32.958 --> 00:06:35.958\nAnd I want to look at Sweden and the United States.\n\n00:06:35.958 --> 00:06:37.958\nAnd I'm going to stage a race here\n\n00:06:37.958 --> 00:06:40.958\nbetween this sort of yellowish Ford here\n\n00:06:40.958 --> 00:06:42.958\nand the red Toyota down there,\n\n00:06:42.958 --> 00:06:44.958\nand the brownish Volvo.\n\n00:06:44.958 --> 00:06:46.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:06:46.958 --> 00:06:48.958\nAnd here we go. Here we go.\n\n00:06:48.958 --> 00:06:51.958\nThe Toyota has a very bad start down here, you can see,\n\n00:06:51.958 --> 00:06:54.958\nand the United States Ford is going off-road there.\n\n00:06:54.958 --> 00:06:55.958\nAnd the Volvo is doing quite fine.\n\n00:06:55.958 --> 00:06:57.958\nThis is the war. The Toyota got off track, and now\n\n00:06:57.958 --> 00:07:00.958\nthe Toyota is coming on the healthier side of Sweden --\n\n00:07:00.958 --> 00:07:01.958\ncan you see that?\n\n00:07:01.958 --> 00:07:02.958\nAnd they are taking over Sweden,\n\n00:07:02.958 --> 00:07:04.958\nand they are now healthier than Sweden.\n\n00:07:04.958 --> 00:07:06.958\nThat's the part where I sold the Volvo and bought the Toyota.\n\n00:07:06.958 --> 00:07:09.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:07:09.958 --> 00:07:13.958\nAnd now we can see that the rate of change was enormous in Japan.\n\n00:07:13.958 --> 00:07:15.958\nThey really caught up.\n\n00:07:15.958 --> 00:07:17.958\nAnd this changes gradually.\n\n00:07:17.958 --> 00:07:20.958\nWe have to look over generations to understand it.\n\n00:07:20.958 --> 00:07:25.958\nAnd let me show you my own sort of family history --\n\n00:07:25.958 --> 00:07:27.958\nwe made these graphs here.\n\n00:07:27.958 --> 00:07:31.958\nAnd this is the same thing, money down there, and health, you know?\n\n00:07:31.958 --> 00:07:33.958\nAnd this is my family.\n\n00:07:34.958 --> 00:07:38.958\nThis is Sweden, 1830, when my great-great-grandma was born.\n\n00:07:39.958 --> 00:07:41.958\nSweden was like Sierra Leone today.\n\n00:07:42.958 --> 00:07:45.958\nAnd this is when great-grandma was born, 1863.\n\n00:07:46.958 --> 00:07:48.958\nAnd Sweden was like Mozambique.\n\n00:07:48.958 --> 00:07:50.958\nAnd this is when my grandma was born, 1891.\n\n00:07:50.958 --> 00:07:52.958\nShe took care of me as a child,\n\n00:07:52.958 --> 00:07:54.958\nso I'm not talking about statistic now --\n\n00:07:54.958 --> 00:07:56.958\nnow it's oral history in my family.\n\n00:07:57.958 --> 00:07:58.958\nThat's when I believe statistics,\n\n00:07:58.958 --> 00:08:01.958\nwhen it's grandma-verified statistics.\n\n00:08:01.958 --> 00:08:04.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:08:04.958 --> 00:08:07.958\nI think it's the best way of verifying historical statistics.\n\n00:08:07.958 --> 00:08:08.958\nSweden was like Ghana.\n\n00:08:08.958 --> 00:08:11.958\nIt's interesting to see the enormous diversity\n\n00:08:11.958 --> 00:08:13.958\nwithin sub-Saharan Africa.\n\n00:08:14.958 --> 00:08:16.958\nI told you last year, I'll tell you again,\n\n00:08:16.958 --> 00:08:19.958\nmy mother was born in Egypt, and I -- who am I?\n\n00:08:19.958 --> 00:08:20.958\nI'm the Mexican in the family.\n\n00:08:21.958 --> 00:08:23.958\nAnd my daughter, she was born in Chile,\n\n00:08:23.958 --> 00:08:25.958\nand the grand-daughter was born in Singapore,\n\n00:08:25.958 --> 00:08:27.958\nnow the healthiest country on this Earth.\n\n00:08:27.958 --> 00:08:29.958\nIt bypassed Sweden about two to three years ago,\n\n00:08:29.958 --> 00:08:31.958\nwith better child survival.\n\n00:08:31.958 --> 00:08:32.958\nBut they're very small, you know?\n\n00:08:32.958 --> 00:08:34.958\nThey're so close to the hospital we can never\n\n00:08:34.958 --> 00:08:35.958\nbeat them out in these forests.\n\n00:08:35.958 --> 00:08:38.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:08:38.958 --> 00:08:39.958\nBut homage to Singapore.\n\n00:08:39.958 --> 00:08:41.958\nSingapore is the best one.\n\n00:08:41.958 --> 00:08:45.958\nNow this looks also like a very good story.\n\n00:08:45.958 --> 00:08:49.958\nBut it's not really that easy, that it's all a good story.\n\n00:08:49.958 --> 00:08:52.958\nBecause I have to show you one of the other facilities.\n\n00:08:52.958 --> 00:08:57.958\nWe can also make the color here represent the variable --\n\n00:08:57.958 --> 00:08:58.958\nand what am I choosing here?\n\n00:08:58.958 --> 00:09:02.958\nCarbon-dioxide emission, metric ton per capita.\n\n00:09:03.958 --> 00:09:08.958\nThis is 1962, and United States was emitting 16 tons per person.\n\n00:09:08.958 --> 00:09:10.958\nAnd China was emitting 0.6,\n\n00:09:10.958 --> 00:09:14.958\nand India was emitting 0.32 tons per capita.\n\n00:09:14.958 --> 00:09:17.958\nAnd what happens when we moved on?\n\n00:09:17.958 --> 00:09:19.958\nWell, you see the nice story of getting richer\n\n00:09:19.958 --> 00:09:20.958\nand getting healthier --\n\n00:09:20.958 --> 00:09:25.958\neveryone did it at the cost of emission of carbon dioxide.\n\n00:09:25.958 --> 00:09:28.958\nThere is no one who has done it so far.\n\n00:09:28.958 --> 00:09:31.958\nAnd we don't have all the updated data\n\n00:09:31.958 --> 00:09:34.958\nany longer, because this is really hot data today.\n\n00:09:34.958 --> 00:09:36.958\nAnd there we are, 2001.\n\n00:09:37.958 --> 00:09:41.958\nAnd in the discussion I attended with global leaders, you know,\n\n00:09:41.958 --> 00:09:45.958\nmany say now the problem is that the emerging economies,\n\n00:09:45.958 --> 00:09:48.958\nthey are getting out too much carbon dioxide.\n\n00:09:48.958 --> 00:09:50.958\nThe Minister of the Environment of India said,\n\n00:09:50.958 --> 00:09:53.958\n\"Well, you were the one who caused the problem.\"\n\n00:09:53.958 --> 00:09:56.958\nThe OECD countries -- the high-income countries --\n\n00:09:56.958 --> 00:09:58.958\nthey were the ones who caused the climate change.\n\n00:09:59.958 --> 00:10:01.958\n\"But we forgive you, because you didn't know it.\n\n00:10:01.958 --> 00:10:04.958\nBut from now on, we count per capita.\n\n00:10:04.958 --> 00:10:06.958\nFrom now on we count per capita.\n\n00:10:06.958 --> 00:10:09.958\nAnd everyone is responsible for the per capita emission.\"\n\n00:10:09.958 --> 00:10:12.958\nThis really shows you, we have not seen good economic\n\n00:10:12.958 --> 00:10:14.958\nand health progress anywhere in the world\n\n00:10:14.958 --> 00:10:18.958\nwithout destroying the climate.\n\n00:10:19.958 --> 00:10:21.958\nAnd this is really what has to be changed.\n\n00:10:22.958 --> 00:10:25.958\nI've been criticized for showing you a too positive image of the world,\n\n00:10:25.958 --> 00:10:27.958\nbut I don't think it's like this.\n\n00:10:27.958 --> 00:10:29.958\nThe world is quite a messy place.\n\n00:10:29.958 --> 00:10:31.958\nThis we can call Dollar Street.\n\n00:10:31.958 --> 00:10:33.958\nEveryone lives on this street here.\n\n00:10:33.958 --> 00:10:36.958\nWhat they earn here -- what number they live on --\n\n00:10:36.958 --> 00:10:37.958\nis how much they earn per day.\n\n00:10:37.958 --> 00:10:40.958\nThis family earns about one dollar per day.\n\n00:10:41.958 --> 00:10:42.958\nWe drive up the street here,\n\n00:10:42.958 --> 00:10:46.958\nwe find a family here which earns about two to three dollars a day.\n\n00:10:46.958 --> 00:10:49.958\nAnd we drive away here -- we find the first garden in the street,\n\n00:10:49.958 --> 00:10:51.958\nand they earn 10 to 50 dollars a day.\n\n00:10:51.958 --> 00:10:53.958\nAnd how do they live?\n\n00:10:53.958 --> 00:10:56.958\nIf we look at the bed here, we can see\n\n00:10:56.958 --> 00:10:59.958\nthat they sleep on a rug on the floor.\n\n00:10:59.958 --> 00:11:01.958\nThis is what poverty line is --\n\n00:11:01.958 --> 00:11:04.958\n80 percent of the family income is just to cover the energy needs,\n\n00:11:04.958 --> 00:11:06.958\nthe food for the day.\n\n00:11:06.958 --> 00:11:09.958\nThis is two to five dollars. You have a bed.\n\n00:11:09.958 --> 00:11:11.958\nAnd here it's a much nicer bedroom, you can see.\n\n00:11:12.958 --> 00:11:14.958\nI lectured on this for Ikea, and they wanted to see\n\n00:11:14.958 --> 00:11:16.958\nthe sofa immediately here.\n\n00:11:16.958 --> 00:11:18.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:11:18.958 --> 00:11:22.958\nAnd this is the sofa, how it will emerge from there.\n\n00:11:22.958 --> 00:11:25.958\nAnd the interesting thing, when you go around here in the photo panorama,\n\n00:11:25.958 --> 00:11:27.958\nyou see the family still sitting on the floor there.\n\n00:11:27.958 --> 00:11:29.958\nAlthough there is a sofa,\n\n00:11:29.958 --> 00:11:31.958\nif you watch in the kitchen, you can see that\n\n00:11:31.958 --> 00:11:36.958\nthe great difference for women does not come between one to 10 dollars.\n\n00:11:36.958 --> 00:11:38.958\nIt comes beyond here, when you really can get\n\n00:11:38.958 --> 00:11:41.958\ngood working conditions in the family.\n\n00:11:41.958 --> 00:11:43.958\nAnd if you really want to see the difference,\n\n00:11:43.958 --> 00:11:45.958\nyou look at the toilet over here.\n\n00:11:45.958 --> 00:11:47.958\nThis can change. This can change.\n\n00:11:47.958 --> 00:11:50.958\nThese are all pictures and images from Africa,\n\n00:11:50.958 --> 00:11:52.958\nand it can become much better.\n\n00:11:53.958 --> 00:11:55.958\nWe can get out of poverty.\n\n00:11:55.958 --> 00:11:58.958\nMy own research has not been in IT or anything like this.\n\n00:11:58.958 --> 00:12:01.958\nI spent 20 years in interviews with African farmers\n\n00:12:01.958 --> 00:12:04.958\nwho were on the verge of famine.\n\n00:12:04.958 --> 00:12:06.958\nAnd this is the result of the farmers-needs research.\n\n00:12:06.958 --> 00:12:08.958\nThe nice thing here is that you can't see\n\n00:12:08.958 --> 00:12:10.958\nwho are the researchers in this picture.\n\n00:12:10.958 --> 00:12:13.958\nThat's when research functions in poor societies --\n\n00:12:13.958 --> 00:12:15.958\nyou must really live with the people.\n\n00:12:17.958 --> 00:12:21.958\nWhen you're in poverty, everything is about survival.\n\n00:12:21.958 --> 00:12:23.958\nIt's about having food.\n\n00:12:23.958 --> 00:12:25.958\nAnd these two young farmers, they are girls now --\n\n00:12:25.958 --> 00:12:29.958\nbecause the parents are dead from HIV and AIDS --\n\n00:12:29.958 --> 00:12:31.958\nthey discuss with a trained agronomist.\n\n00:12:31.958 --> 00:12:35.958\nThis is one of the best agronomists in Malawi, Junatambe Kumbira,\n\n00:12:35.958 --> 00:12:37.958\nand he's discussing what sort of cassava they will plant --\n\n00:12:37.958 --> 00:12:41.958\nthe best converter of sunshine to food that man has found.\n\n00:12:41.958 --> 00:12:44.958\nAnd they are very, very eagerly interested to get advice,\n\n00:12:44.958 --> 00:12:47.958\nand that's to survive in poverty.\n\n00:12:47.958 --> 00:12:48.958\nThat's one context.\n\n00:12:48.958 --> 00:12:50.958\nGetting out of poverty.\n\n00:12:50.958 --> 00:12:53.958\nThe women told us one thing. \"Get us technology.\n\n00:12:53.958 --> 00:12:56.958\nWe hate this mortar, to stand hours and hours.\n\n00:12:56.958 --> 00:12:59.958\nGet us a mill so that we can mill our flour,\n\n00:12:59.958 --> 00:13:02.958\nthen we will be able to pay for the rest ourselves.\"\n\n00:13:02.958 --> 00:13:05.958\nTechnology will bring you out of poverty,\n\n00:13:05.958 --> 00:13:09.958\nbut there's a need for a market to get away from poverty.\n\n00:13:09.958 --> 00:13:12.958\nAnd this woman is very happy now, bringing her products to the market.\n\n00:13:12.958 --> 00:13:14.958\nBut she's very thankful for the public investment in schooling\n\n00:13:14.958 --> 00:13:17.958\nso she can count, and won't be cheated when she reaches the market.\n\n00:13:17.958 --> 00:13:20.958\nShe wants her kid to be healthy, so she can go to the market\n\n00:13:20.958 --> 00:13:22.958\nand doesn't have to stay home.\n\n00:13:22.958 --> 00:13:25.958\nAnd she wants the infrastructure -- it is nice with a paved road.\n\n00:13:25.958 --> 00:13:27.958\nIt's also good with credit.\n\n00:13:27.958 --> 00:13:30.958\nMicro-credits gave her the bicycle, you know.\n\n00:13:30.958 --> 00:13:33.958\nAnd information will tell her when to go to market with which product.\n\n00:13:33.958 --> 00:13:35.958\nYou can do this.\n\n00:13:35.958 --> 00:13:38.958\nI find my experience from 20 years of Africa is that\n\n00:13:38.958 --> 00:13:41.958\nthe seemingly impossible is possible.\n\n00:13:41.958 --> 00:13:43.958\nAfrica has not done bad.\n\n00:13:43.958 --> 00:13:46.958\nIn 50 years they've gone from a pre-Medieval situation\n\n00:13:46.958 --> 00:13:49.958\nto a very decent 100-year-ago Europe,\n\n00:13:49.958 --> 00:13:52.958\nwith a functioning nation and state.\n\n00:13:52.958 --> 00:13:55.958\nI would say that sub-Saharan Africa has done best in the world\n\n00:13:55.958 --> 00:13:56.958\nduring the last 50 years.\n\n00:13:56.958 --> 00:13:58.958\nBecause we don't consider where they came from.\n\n00:13:58.958 --> 00:14:01.958\nIt's this stupid concept of developing countries\n\n00:14:01.958 --> 00:14:04.958\nthat puts us, Argentina and Mozambique together 50 years ago,\n\n00:14:04.958 --> 00:14:06.958\nand says that Mozambique did worse.\n\n00:14:07.958 --> 00:14:09.958\nWe have to know a little more about the world.\n\n00:14:09.958 --> 00:14:12.958\nI have a neighbor who knows 200 types of wine.\n\n00:14:12.958 --> 00:14:13.958\nHe knows everything.\n\n00:14:13.958 --> 00:14:15.958\nHe knows the name of the grape, the temperature and everything.\n\n00:14:15.958 --> 00:14:18.958\nI only know two types of wine -- red and white.\n\n00:14:18.958 --> 00:14:20.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:14:20.958 --> 00:14:22.958\nBut my neighbor only knows two types of countries --\n\n00:14:22.958 --> 00:14:24.958\nindustrialized and developing.\n\n00:14:24.958 --> 00:14:27.958\nAnd I know 200, I know about the small data.\n\n00:14:27.958 --> 00:14:28.958\nBut you can do that.\n\n00:14:28.958 --> 00:14:33.958\n(Applause)\n\n00:14:33.958 --> 00:14:35.958\nBut I have to get serious. And how do you get serious?\n\n00:14:35.958 --> 00:14:37.958\nYou make a PowerPoint, you know?\n\n00:14:37.958 --> 00:14:42.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:14:42.958 --> 00:14:44.958\nHomage to the Office package, no?\n\n00:14:46.958 --> 00:14:48.958\nWhat is this, what is this, what am I telling?\n\n00:14:48.958 --> 00:14:51.958\nI'm telling you that there are many dimensions of development.\n\n00:14:51.958 --> 00:14:53.958\nEveryone wants your pet thing.\n\n00:14:53.958 --> 00:14:56.958\nIf you are in the corporate sector, you love micro-credit.\n\n00:14:56.958 --> 00:14:58.958\nIf you are fighting in a non-governmental organization,\n\n00:14:58.958 --> 00:15:01.958\nyou love equity between gender.\n\n00:15:01.958 --> 00:15:03.958\nOr if you are a teacher, you'll love UNESCO, and so on.\n\n00:15:03.958 --> 00:15:05.958\nOn the global level, we have to have more than our own thing.\n\n00:15:05.958 --> 00:15:07.958\nWe need everything.\n\n00:15:07.958 --> 00:15:09.958\nAll these things are important for development,\n\n00:15:09.958 --> 00:15:11.958\nespecially when you just get out of poverty\n\n00:15:11.958 --> 00:15:14.958\nand you should go towards welfare.\n\n00:15:14.958 --> 00:15:16.958\nNow, what we need to think about\n\n00:15:16.958 --> 00:15:19.958\nis, what is a goal for development,\n\n00:15:19.958 --> 00:15:20.958\nand what are the means for development?\n\n00:15:20.958 --> 00:15:23.958\nLet me first grade what are the most important means.\n\n00:15:24.958 --> 00:15:26.958\nEconomic growth to me, as a public-health professor,\n\n00:15:26.958 --> 00:15:30.958\nis the most important thing for development\n\n00:15:30.958 --> 00:15:32.958\nbecause it explains 80 percent of survival.\n\n00:15:33.958 --> 00:15:36.958\nGovernance. To have a government which functions --\n\n00:15:36.958 --> 00:15:40.958\nthat's what brought California out of the misery of 1850.\n\n00:15:40.958 --> 00:15:43.958\nIt was the government that made law function finally.\n\n00:15:44.958 --> 00:15:46.958\nEducation, human resources are important.\n\n00:15:46.958 --> 00:15:50.958\nHealth is also important, but not that much as a mean.\n\n00:15:50.958 --> 00:15:52.958\nEnvironment is important.\n\n00:15:52.958 --> 00:15:54.958\nHuman rights is also important, but it just gets one cross.\n\n00:15:54.958 --> 00:15:57.958\nNow what about goals? Where are we going toward?\n\n00:15:57.958 --> 00:15:59.958\nWe are not interested in money.\n\n00:15:59.958 --> 00:16:00.958\nMoney is not a goal.\n\n00:16:00.958 --> 00:16:03.958\nIt's the best mean, but I give it zero as a goal.\n\n00:16:04.958 --> 00:16:07.958\nGovernance, well it's fun to vote in a little thing,\n\n00:16:07.958 --> 00:16:09.958\nbut it's not a goal.\n\n00:16:09.958 --> 00:16:13.958\nAnd going to school, that's not a goal, it's a mean.\n\n00:16:13.958 --> 00:16:15.958\nHealth I give two points. I mean it's nice to be healthy\n\n00:16:15.958 --> 00:16:17.958\n-- at my age especially -- you can stand here, you're healthy.\n\n00:16:17.958 --> 00:16:19.958\nAnd that's good, it gets two plusses.\n\n00:16:19.958 --> 00:16:21.958\nEnvironment is very, very crucial.\n\n00:16:21.958 --> 00:16:23.958\nThere's nothing for the grandkid if you don't save up.\n\n00:16:23.958 --> 00:16:25.958\nBut where are the important goals?\n\n00:16:25.958 --> 00:16:27.958\nOf course, it's human rights.\n\n00:16:27.958 --> 00:16:29.958\nHuman rights is the goal,\n\n00:16:29.958 --> 00:16:32.958\nbut it's not that strong of a mean for achieving development.\n\n00:16:33.958 --> 00:16:37.958\nAnd culture. Culture is the most important thing, I would say,\n\n00:16:37.958 --> 00:16:39.958\nbecause that's what brings joy to life.\n\n00:16:39.958 --> 00:16:41.958\nThat's the value of living.\n\n00:16:41.958 --> 00:16:44.958\nSo the seemingly impossible is possible.\n\n00:16:44.958 --> 00:16:46.958\nEven African countries can achieve this.\n\n00:16:47.958 --> 00:16:53.958\nAnd I've shown you the shot where the seemingly impossible is possible.\n\n00:16:53.958 --> 00:16:57.958\nAnd remember, please remember my main message,\n\n00:16:57.958 --> 00:17:00.958\nwhich is this: the seemingly impossible is possible.\n\n00:17:00.958 --> 00:17:02.958\nWe can have a good world.\n\n00:17:02.958 --> 00:17:05.958\nI showed you the shots, I proved it in the PowerPoint,\n\n00:17:05.958 --> 00:17:11.958\nand I think I will convince you also by culture.\n\n00:17:11.958 --> 00:17:15.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:17:15.958 --> 00:17:16.958\n(Applause)\n\n00:17:16.958 --> 00:17:18.958\nBring me my sword!\n\n00:17:22.958 --> 00:17:27.958\nSword swallowing is from ancient India.\n\n00:17:27.958 --> 00:17:32.958\nIt's a cultural expression that for thousands of years\n\n00:17:32.958 --> 00:17:38.958\nhas inspired human beings to think beyond the obvious.\n\n00:17:38.958 --> 00:17:40.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:17:40.958 --> 00:17:45.958\nAnd I will now prove to you that the seemingly impossible is possible\n\n00:17:45.958 --> 00:17:48.958\nby taking this piece of steel -- solid steel --\n\n00:17:49.958 --> 00:17:52.958\nthis is the army bayonet from the Swedish Army, 1850,\n\n00:17:52.958 --> 00:17:54.958\nin the last year we had war.\n\n00:17:55.958 --> 00:17:58.958\nAnd it's all solid steel -- you can hear here.\n\n00:17:58.958 --> 00:18:04.958\nAnd I'm going to take this blade of steel,\n\n00:18:04.958 --> 00:18:09.958\nand push it down through my body of blood and flesh,\n\n00:18:09.958 --> 00:18:13.958\nand prove to you that the seemingly impossible is possible.\n\n00:18:14.958 --> 00:18:18.958\nCan I request a moment of absolute silence?\n\n00:18:29.958 --> 00:18:51.958\n(Applause)"}, {"title": "I'm going to the moon. Who's with me?", "duration": "1063", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/bill_stone_explores_the_earth_and_space", "transcript": "First place I'd like to take you is what many believe will be the world's deepest natural abyss. And I say believe because this process is still ongoing. Right now there are major expeditions being planned for next year that I'll talk a little bit about.One of the things that's changed here, in the last 150 years since Jules Verne had great science-fiction concepts of what the underworld was like, is that technology has enabled us to go to these places that were previously completely unknown and speculated about. We can now descend thousands of meters into the Earth with relative impunity. Along the way we've discovered fantastic abysses and chambers so large that you can see for hundreds of meters without a break in the line of sight. When you go on a thing like this, we can usually be in the field for anywhere from two to four months, with a team as small as 20 or 30, to as big as 150.And a lot of people ask me, you know, what kind of people do you get for a project like this? While our selection process is not as rigorous as NASA, it's nonetheless thorough. We're looking for competence, discipline, endurance, and strength. In case you're wondering, this is our strength test. (Laughter) But we also value esprit de corps and the ability to diplomatically resolve inter-personal conflict while under great stress in remote locations.We have already gone far beyond the limits of human endurance. From the entrance, this is nothing like a commercial cave. You're looking at Camp Two in a place called J2, not K2, but J2. We're roughly two days from the entrance at that point. And it's kind of like a high altitude mountaineering trip in reverse, except that you're now running a string of these things down. The idea is to try to provide some measure of physical comfort while you're down there, otherwise in damp, moist, cold conditions in utterly dark places. I should mention that everything you're seeing here, by the way, is artificially illuminated at great effort. Otherwise it is completely dark in these places.The deeper you go, the more you run into a conflict with water. It's basically like a tree collecting water coming down. And eventually you get to places where it is formidable and dangerous and unfortunately slides just don't do justice. So I've got a very brief clip here that was taken in the late 1980s. So descend into Huautla Plateau in Mexico. (Video) Now I have to tell you that the techniques being shown here are obsolete and dangerous. We would not do this today unless we were doing it for film. (Laughter)Along that same line, I have to tell you that with the spate of Hollywood movies that came out last year, we have never seen monsters underground \u2014 at least the kind that eat you. If there is a monster underground, it is the crushing psychological remoteness that begins to hit every member of the team once you cross about three days inbound from the nearest entrance.Next year I'll be leading an international team to J2. We're going to be shooting from minus 2,600 meters \u2014 that's a little over 8,600 feet down \u2014 at 30 kilometers from the entrance. The lead crews will be underground for pushing 30 days straight. I don't think there's been a mission like that in a long time.Eventually, if you keep going down in these things, probability says that you're going to run into a place like this. It's a place where there's a fold in the geologic stratum that collects water and fills to the roof. And when you used to find these things, they would put a label on a map that said terminal siphon. Now I remember that term really well for two reasons. Number one, it's the name of my rock band, and second, is because the confrontation of these things forced me to become an inventor. And we've since gone on to develop many generations of gadgets for exploring places like this.This is some life-support equipment closed-cycle. And you can use that now to go for many kilometers horizontally underwater and to depths of 200 meters straight down underwater. When you do this kind of stuff it's like doing EVA. It's like doing extra-vehicular activity in space, but at much greater distances, and at much greater physical peril. So it makes you think about how to design your equipment for long range, away from a safe haven.Here's a clip from a National Geographic movie that came out in 1999.(Video) Narrator: Exploration is a physical process of putting your foot in places where humans have never stepped before. This is where the last little nugget of totally unknown territory remains on this planet. To experience it is a privilege.Bill Stone: That was taken in Wakulla Springs, Florida. Couple of things to note about that movie. Every piece of equipment that you saw in there did not exist before 1999. It was developed within a two-year period and used on actual exploratory projects. This gadget you see right here was called the digital wall mapper, and it produced the first three-dimensional map anybody has ever done of a cave, and it happened to be underwater in Wakulla Springs. It was that gadget that serendipitously opened a door to another unexplored world.This is Europa. Carolyn Porco mentioned another one called Enceladus the other day. This is one of the places where planetary scientists believe there is a highest probability of the detection of the first life off earth in the ocean that exists below there. For those who have never seen this story, Jim Cameron produced a really wonderful IMAX movie couple of years ago, called \"Aliens of the Deep.\" There was a brief clip \u2014(Video) Narrator: A mission to explore under the ice of Europa would be the ultimate robotic challenge. Europa is so far away that even at the speed of light, it would take more than an hour for the command just to reach the vehicle. It has to be smart enough to avoid terrain hazards and to find a good landing site on the ice. Now we have to get through the ice. You need a melt probe. It's basically a nuclear-heated torpedo. The ice could be anywhere from three to 16 miles deep. Week after week, the melt probe will sink of its own weight through the ancient ice, until finally \u2014 Now, what are you going to do when you reach the surface of that ocean? You need an AUV, an autonomous underwater vehicle. It needs to be one smart puppy, able to navigate and make decisions on its own in an alien ocean.BS: What Jim didn't know when he released that movie was that six months earlier NASA had funded a team I assembled to develop a prototype for the Europa AUV. I mean, I cut through three years of engineering meetings, design and system integration, and introduced DEPTHX \u2014 Deep Phreatic Thermal Explorer. And as the movie says, this is one smart puppy. It's got 96 sensors, 36 onboard computers, 100,000 lines of behavioral autonomy code, packs more than 10 kilos of TNT in electrical onboard equivalent.This is the target site, the world's deepest hydrothermal spring at Cenote Zacaton in northern Mexico. It's been explored to a depth of 292 meters and beyond that nobody knows anything. This is part of DEPTHX's mission.There are two primary targets we're doing here. One is, how do you do science autonomy underground? How do you take a robot and turn it into a field microbiologist? There are more stages involved here than I've got time to tell you about, but basically we drive through the space, we populate it with environmental variables \u2014 sulphide, halide, things like that. We calculate gradient surfaces, and drive the bot over to a wall where there's a high probability of life. We move along the wall, in what's called proximity operations, looking for changes in color. If we see something that looks interesting, we pull it into a microscope. If it passes the microscopic test, we go for a collection. We either draw in a liquid sample, or we can actually take a solid core from the wall. No hands at the wheel. This is all behavioral autonomy here that's being conducted by the robot on its own.The real hat trick for this vehicle, though, is a disruptive new navigation system we've developed, known as 3D SLAM, for simultaneous localization and mapping. DEPTHX is an all-seeing eyeball. Its sensor beams look both forward and backward at the same time, allowing it to do new exploration while it's still achieving geometric sensor-lock on what it's gone through already.What I'm going to show you next is the first fully autonomous robotic exploration underground that's ever been done. This May, we're going to go from minus 1,000 meters in Zacaton, and if we're very lucky, DEPTHX will bring back the first robotically-discovered division of bacteria. The next step after that is to test it in Antartica and then, if the funding continues and NASA has the resolution to go, we could potentially launch by 2016, and by 2019 we may have the first evidence of life off this planet.What then of manned space exploration? The government recently announced plans to return to the moon by 2024. The successful conclusion of that mission will result in infrequent visitation of the moon by a small number of government scientists and pilots. It will leave us no further along in the general expansion of humanity into space than we were 50 years ago. Something fundamental has to change if we are to see common access to space in our lifetime.What I'm going to show you next are a couple of controversial ideas. And I hope you'll bear with me and have some faith that there's credibility behind what we're going to say here. There are three underpinnings of working in space privately. One of them is the requirement for economical earth-to-space transport. The Bert Rutans and Richard Bransons of this world have got this in their sights and I salute them. Go, go, go.The next thing we need are places to stay on orbit. Orbital hotels to start with, but workshops for the rest of us later on. The final missing piece, the real paradigm-buster, is this: a gas station on orbit. It's not going to look like that. If it existed, it would change all future spacecraft design and space mission planning.Now, to give you a chance to understand why there is power in that statement, I've got to give you the basics of Space 101. And the first thing is everything you do in space you pay by the kilogram. Anybody drink one of these here this week? You'd pay 10,000 dollars for that in orbit. That's more than you pay for TED, if Google dropped their sponsorship. (Laughter) The second is more than 90 percent of the weight of a vehicle is in propellant. Thus, every time you'd want to do anything in space, you are literally blowing away enormous sums of money every time you hit the accelerator. Not even the guys at Tesla can fight that physics.So, what if you could get your gas at a 10th the price? There is a place where you can. In fact, you can get it better \u2014 you can get it at 14 times lower if you can find propellant on the moon. There is a little-known mission that was launched by the Pentagon, 13 years ago now, called Clementine. And the most amazing thing that came out of that mission was a strong hydrogen signature at Shackleton crater on the south pole of the moon. That signal was so strong, it could only have been produced by 10 trillion tons of water buried in the sediment, collected over millions and billions of years by the impact of asteroids and comet material.If we're going to get that, and make that gas station possible, we have to figure out ways to move large volumes of payload through space. We can't do that right now. The way you normally build a system right now is you have a tube stack that has to be launched from the ground, and resist all kinds of aerodynamic forces. We have to beat that. We can do it because in space there are no aerodynamics. We can go and use inflatable systems for almost everything. This is an idea that, again, came out of Livermore back in 1989, with Dr. Lowell Wood's group. And we can extend that now to just about everything. Bob Bigelow currently has a test article in the orbit. We can go much further. We can build space tugs, orbiting platforms for holding cryogens and water. There's another thing. When you're coming back from the moon, you have to deal with orbital mechanics. It says you're moving 10,000 feet per second faster than you really want to be to get back to your gas station.You got two choices. You can burn rocket fuel to get there, or you can do something really incredible. You can dive into the stratosphere, and precisely dissipate that velocity, and come back out to the space station. It has never been done. It's risky and it's going to be one hell of a ride \u2014 better than Disney. The traditional approach to space exploration has been that you carry all the fuel you need to get everybody back in case of an emergency. If you try to do that for the moon, you're going to burn a billion dollars in fuel alone sending a crew out there. But if you send a mining team there, without the return propellant, first \u2014 (Laughter) Did any of you guys hear the story of Cortez? This is not like that. I'm much more like Scotty. I like this equipment, you know, and I really value it so we're not going to burn the gear. But, if you were truly bold you could get it there, manufacture it, and it would be the most dramatic demonstration that you could do something worthwhile off this planet that has ever been done. There's a myth that you can't do anything in space for less than a trillion dollars and 20 years. That's not true. In seven years, we could pull off an industrial mission to Shackleton and demonstrate that you could provide commercial reality out of this in low-earth orbit.We're living in one of the most exciting times in history. We're at a magical confluence where private wealth and imagination are driving the demand for access to space. The orbital refueling stations I've just described could create an entirely new industry and provide the final key for opening space to the general exploration. To bust the paradigm a radically different approach is needed. We can do it by jump-starting with an industrial Lewis and Clark expedition to Shackleton crater, to mine the moon for resources, and demonstrate they can form the basis for a profitable business on orbit.Talk about space always seems to be hung on ambiguities of purpose and timing. I would like to close here by putting a stake in the sand at TED. I intend to lead that expedition. (Applause) It can be done in seven years with the right backing. Those who join me in making it happen will become a part of history and join other bold individuals from time past who, had they been here today, would have heartily approved.There was once a time when people did bold things to open the frontier. We have collectively forgotten that lesson. Now we're at a time when boldness is required to move forward. 100 years after Sir Ernest Shackleton wrote these words, I intend to plant an industrial flag on the moon and complete the final piece that will open the space frontier, in our time, for all of us. Thank you.

down.\n\n00:02:02.958 --> 00:02:06.958\nThe idea is to try to provide some measure of physical comfort\n\n00:02:06.958 --> 00:02:12.958\nwhile you're down there, otherwise in damp, moist, cold conditions in utterly dark places.\n\n00:02:12.958 --> 00:02:15.958\nI should mention that everything you're seeing here, by the way,\n\n00:02:15.958 --> 00:02:18.958\nis artificially illuminated at great effort.\n\n00:02:18.958 --> 00:02:20.958\nOtherwise it is completely dark in these places.\n\n00:02:20.958 --> 00:02:25.958\nThe deeper you go, the more you run into a conflict with water.\n\n00:02:25.958 --> 00:02:28.958\nIt's basically like a tree collecting water coming down.\n\n00:02:29.958 --> 00:02:32.958\nAnd eventually you get to places where it is formidable and dangerous\n\n00:02:33.958 --> 00:02:36.958\nand unfortunately slides just don't do justice.\n\n00:02:36.958 --> 00:02:41.958\nSo I've got a very brief clip here that was taken in the late 1980s.\n\n00:02:41.958 --> 00:02:44.958\nSo descend into Huautla Plateau in Mexico.\n\n00:02:44.958 --> 00:02:48.958\n(Video)\n\n00:02:48.958 --> 00:02:51.958\nNow I have to tell you that the techniques being shown here\n\n00:02:51.958 --> 00:02:53.958\nare obsolete and dangerous.\n\n00:02:53.958 --> 00:02:56.958\nWe would not do this today unless we were doing it for film.\n\n00:02:57.958 --> 00:03:01.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:03:01.958 --> 00:03:03.958\nAlong that same line, I have to tell you\n\n00:03:03.958 --> 00:03:06.958\nthat with the spate of Hollywood movies that came out last year,\n\n00:03:06.958 --> 00:03:10.958\nwe have never seen monsters underground --\n\n00:03:10.958 --> 00:03:12.958\nat least the kind that eat you.\n\n00:03:12.958 --> 00:03:16.958\nIf there is a monster underground,\n\n00:03:16.958 --> 00:03:19.958\nit is the crushing psychological remoteness\n\n00:03:19.958 --> 00:03:21.958\nthat begins to hit every member of the team\n\n00:03:21.958 --> 00:03:25.958\nonce you cross about three days inbound from the nearest entrance.\n\n00:03:26.958 --> 00:03:30.958\nNext year I'll be leading an international team to J2.\n\n00:03:30.958 --> 00:03:32.958\nWe're going to be shooting from minus 2,600 meters --\n\n00:03:32.958 --> 00:03:35.958\nthat's a little over 8,600 feet down --\n\n00:03:35.958 --> 00:03:37.958\nat 30 kilometers from the entrance.\n\n00:03:37.958 --> 00:03:41.958\nThe lead crews will be underground for pushing 30 days straight.\n\n00:03:41.958 --> 00:03:43.958\nI don't think there's been a mission like that in a long time.\n\n00:03:44.958 --> 00:03:46.958\nEventually, if you keep going down in these things,\n\n00:03:46.958 --> 00:03:49.958\nprobability says that you're going to run into a place like this.\n\n00:03:49.958 --> 00:03:53.958\nIt's a place where there's a fold in the geologic stratum\n\n00:03:53.958 --> 00:03:55.958\nthat collects water and fills to the roof.\n\n00:03:55.958 --> 00:03:58.958\nAnd when you used to find these things,\n\n00:03:58.958 --> 00:04:01.958\nthey would put a label on a map that said terminal siphon.\n\n00:04:01.958 --> 00:04:03.958\nNow I remember that term really well for two reasons.\n\n00:04:03.958 --> 00:04:06.958\nNumber one, it's the name of my rock band, and second,\n\n00:04:06.958 --> 00:04:09.958\nis because the confrontation of these things\n\n00:04:09.958 --> 00:04:11.958\nforced me to become an inventor.\n\n00:04:11.958 --> 00:04:14.958\nAnd we've since gone on to develop\n\n00:04:14.958 --> 00:04:17.958\nmany generations of gadgets for exploring places like this.\n\n00:04:17.958 --> 00:04:19.958\nThis is some life-support equipment closed-cycle.\n\n00:04:20.958 --> 00:04:23.958\nAnd you can use that now to go for many kilometers horizontally\n\n00:04:23.958 --> 00:04:26.958\nunderwater and to depths of 200 meters straight down underwater.\n\n00:04:27.958 --> 00:04:30.958\nWhen you do this kind of stuff it's like doing EVA.\n\n00:04:30.958 --> 00:04:33.958\nIt's like doing extra-vehicular activity in space,\n\n00:04:33.958 --> 00:04:37.958\nbut at much greater distances, and at much greater physical peril.\n\n00:04:37.958 --> 00:04:39.958\nSo it makes you think about how to design your equipment\n\n00:04:39.958 --> 00:04:41.958\nfor long range, away from a safe haven.\n\n00:04:42.958 --> 00:04:44.958\nHere's a clip from a National Geographic movie\n\n00:04:44.958 --> 00:04:46.958\nthat came out in 1999.\n\n00:04:46.958 --> 00:04:48.958\n(Video) Narrator: Exploration is a physical process\n\n00:04:48.958 --> 00:04:52.958\nof putting your foot in places where humans have never stepped before.\n\n00:04:52.958 --> 00:04:57.958\nThis is where the last little nugget of totally unknown territory remains on this planet.\n\n00:04:57.958 --> 00:04:59.958\nTo experience it is a privilege.\n\n00:05:04.958 --> 00:05:07.958\nBill Stone: That was taken in Wakulla Springs, Florida.\n\n00:05:08.958 --> 00:05:12.958\nCouple of things to note about that movie. Every piece of equipment\n\n00:05:12.958 --> 00:05:14.958\nthat you saw in there did not exist before 1999.\n\n00:05:14.958 --> 00:05:19.958\nIt was developed within a two-year period and used on actual exploratory projects.\n\n00:05:19.958 --> 00:05:22.958\nThis gadget you see right here was called the digital wall mapper,\n\n00:05:22.958 --> 00:05:26.958\nand it produced the first three-dimensional map anybody has ever done\n\n00:05:26.958 --> 00:05:29.958\nof a cave, and it happened to be underwater in Wakulla Springs.\n\n00:05:29.958 --> 00:05:33.958\nIt was that gadget that serendipitously opened a door\n\n00:05:33.958 --> 00:05:34.958\nto another unexplored world.\n\n00:05:34.958 --> 00:05:38.958\nThis is Europa.\n\n00:05:38.958 --> 00:05:42.958\nCarolyn Porco mentioned another one called Enceladus the other day.\n\n00:05:42.958 --> 00:05:45.958\nThis is one of the places where planetary scientists\n\n00:05:45.958 --> 00:05:47.958\nbelieve there is a highest probability of the detection\n\n00:05:47.958 --> 00:05:51.958\nof the first life off earth in the ocean that exists below there.\n\n00:05:51.958 --> 00:05:53.958\nFor those who have never seen this story,\n\n00:05:53.958 --> 00:05:56.958\nJim Cameron produced a really wonderful IMAX movie\n\n00:05:56.958 --> 00:05:58.958\ncouple of years ago, called \"Aliens of the Deep.\"\n\n00:05:58.958 --> 00:06:00.958\nThere was a brief clip --\n\n00:06:02.958 --> 00:06:04.958\n(Video) Narrator: A mission to explore under the ice of Europa\n\n00:06:04.958 --> 00:06:07.958\nwould be the ultimate robotic challenge.\n\n00:06:10.958 --> 00:06:16.958\nEuropa is so far away that even at the speed of light,\n\n00:06:16.958 --> 00:06:19.958\nit would take more than an hour for the command just to reach the vehicle.\n\n00:06:20.958 --> 00:06:23.958\nIt has to be smart enough to avoid terrain hazards\n\n00:06:23.958 --> 00:06:25.958\nand to find a good landing site on the ice.\n\n00:06:35.958 --> 00:06:37.958\nNow we have to get through the ice.\n\n00:06:38.958 --> 00:06:40.958\nYou need a melt probe.\n\n00:06:40.958 --> 00:06:43.958\nIt's basically a nuclear-heated torpedo.\n\n00:06:53.958 --> 00:06:56.958\nThe ice could be anywhere from three to 16 miles deep.\n\n00:06:57.958 --> 00:07:00.958\nWeek after week, the melt probe will sink of its own weight\n\n00:07:00.958 --> 00:07:03.958\nthrough the ancient ice, until finally --\n\n00:07:09.958 --> 00:07:12.958\nNow, what are you going to do when you reach the surface of that ocean?\n\n00:07:15.958 --> 00:07:19.958\nYou need an AUV, an autonomous underwater vehicle.\n\n00:07:20.958 --> 00:07:22.958\nIt needs to be one smart puppy, able to navigate\n\n00:07:22.958 --> 00:07:25.958\nand make decisions on its own in an alien ocean.\n\n00:07:27.958 --> 00:07:29.958\nBS: What Jim didn't know when he released that movie\n\n00:07:29.958 --> 00:07:34.958\nwas that six months earlier NASA had funded a team I assembled\n\n00:07:34.958 --> 00:07:37.958\nto develop a prototype for the Europa AUV.\n\n00:07:37.958 --> 00:07:42.958\nI mean, I cut through three years of engineering meetings, design\n\n00:07:42.958 --> 00:07:44.958\nand system integration, and introduced DEPTHX --\n\n00:07:45.958 --> 00:07:47.958\nDeep Phreatic Thermal Explorer.\n\n00:07:47.958 --> 00:07:50.958\nAnd as the movie says, this is one smart puppy.\n\n00:07:50.958 --> 00:07:55.958\nIt's got 96 sensors, 36 onboard computers,\n\n00:07:55.958 --> 00:07:58.958\n100,000 lines of behavioral autonomy code,\n\n00:07:58.958 --> 00:08:03.958\npacks more than 10 kilos of TNT in electrical onboard equivalent.\n\n00:08:03.958 --> 00:08:05.958\nThis is the target site,\n\n00:08:05.958 --> 00:08:10.958\nthe world's deepest hydrothermal spring at Cenote Zacaton in northern Mexico.\n\n00:08:10.958 --> 00:08:13.958\nIt's been explored to a depth of 292 meters\n\n00:08:13.958 --> 00:08:15.958\nand beyond that nobody knows anything.\n\n00:08:16.958 --> 00:08:18.958\nThis is part of DEPTHX's mission.\n\n00:08:18.958 --> 00:08:20.958\nThere are two primary targets we're doing here.\n\n00:08:20.958 --> 00:08:22.958\nOne is, how do you do science autonomy underground?\n\n00:08:22.958 --> 00:08:26.958\nHow do you take a robot and turn it into a field microbiologist?\n\n00:08:26.958 --> 00:08:28.958\nThere are more stages involved here\n\n00:08:28.958 --> 00:08:30.958\nthan I've got time to tell you about, but basically we drive\n\n00:08:30.958 --> 00:08:34.958\nthrough the space, we populate it with environmental variables --\n\n00:08:34.958 --> 00:08:36.958\nsulphide, halide, things like that.\n\n00:08:36.958 --> 00:08:39.958\nWe calculate gradient surfaces, and drive the bot over to a wall\n\n00:08:39.958 --> 00:08:41.958\nwhere there's a high probability of life.\n\n00:08:41.958 --> 00:08:43.958\nWe move along the wall, in what's called proximity operations,\n\n00:08:43.958 --> 00:08:45.958\nlooking for changes in color.\n\n00:08:45.958 --> 00:08:48.958\nIf we see something that looks interesting, we pull it into a microscope.\n\n00:08:48.958 --> 00:08:52.958\nIf it passes the microscopic test, we go for a collection.\n\n00:08:52.958 --> 00:08:54.958\nWe either draw in a liquid sample,\n\n00:08:54.958 --> 00:08:57.958\nor we can actually take a solid core from the wall.\n\n00:08:57.958 --> 00:08:58.958\nNo hands at the wheel.\n\n00:08:58.958 --> 00:09:00.958\nThis is all behavioral autonomy here\n\n00:09:00.958 --> 00:09:02.958\nthat's being conducted by the robot on its own.\n\n00:09:03.958 --> 00:09:05.958\nThe real hat trick for this vehicle, though,\n\n00:09:05.958 --> 00:09:08.958\nis a disruptive new navigation system we've developed,\n\n00:09:08.958 --> 00:09:12.958\nknown as 3D SLAM, for simultaneous localization and mapping.\n\n00:09:12.958 --> 00:09:14.958\nDEPTHX is an all-seeing eyeball.\n\n00:09:14.958 --> 00:09:18.958\nIts sensor beams look both forward and backward at the same time,\n\n00:09:18.958 --> 00:09:21.958\nallowing it to do new exploration\n\n00:09:21.958 --> 00:09:23.958\nwhile it's still achieving geometric sensor-lock\n\n00:09:23.958 --> 00:09:24.958\non what it's gone through already.\n\n00:09:24.958 --> 00:09:27.958\nWhat I'm going to show you next\n\n00:09:27.958 --> 00:09:31.958\nis the first fully autonomous robotic exploration underground\n\n00:09:31.958 --> 00:09:34.958\nthat's ever been done.\n\n00:10:22.958 --> 00:10:25.958\nThis May, we're going to go from minus 1,000 meters in Zacaton,\n\n00:10:25.958 --> 00:10:28.958\nand if we're very lucky, DEPTHX will bring back the first\n\n00:10:28.958 --> 00:10:30.958\nrobotically-discovered division of bacteria.\n\n00:10:31.958 --> 00:10:34.958\nThe next step after that is to test it in Antartica and then,\n\n00:10:34.958 --> 00:10:37.958\nif the funding continues and NASA has the resolution to go,\n\n00:10:37.958 --> 00:10:41.958\nwe could potentially launch by 2016, and by 2019\n\n00:10:41.958 --> 00:10:44.958\nwe may have the first evidence of life off this planet.\n\n00:10:45.958 --> 00:10:48.958\nWhat then of manned space exploration?\n\n00:10:50.958 --> 00:10:53.958\nThe government recently announced plans to return to the moon by 2024.\n\n00:10:54.958 --> 00:10:57.958\nThe successful conclusion of that mission will result\n\n00:10:57.958 --> 00:11:01.958\nin infrequent visitation of the moon by a small number\n\n00:11:01.958 --> 00:11:03.958\nof government scientists and pilots.\n\n00:11:03.958 --> 00:11:07.958\nIt will leave us no further along in the general expansion\n\n00:11:07.958 --> 00:11:09.958\nof humanity into space than we were 50 years ago.\n\n00:11:10.958 --> 00:11:12.958\nSomething fundamental has to change\n\n00:11:12.958 --> 00:11:15.958\nif we are to see common access to space in our lifetime.\n\n00:11:15.958 --> 00:11:18.958\nWhat I'm going to show you next are a couple of controversial ideas.\n\n00:11:19.958 --> 00:11:21.958\nAnd I hope you'll bear with me and have some faith\n\n00:11:21.958 --> 00:11:25.958\nthat there's credibility behind what we're going to say here.\n\n00:11:25.958 --> 00:11:32.958\nThere are three underpinnings of working in space privately.\n\n00:11:32.958 --> 00:11:34.958\nOne of them is the requirement\n\n00:11:34.958 --> 00:11:36.958\nfor economical earth-to-space transport.\n\n00:11:37.958 --> 00:11:40.958\nThe Bert Rutans and Richard Bransons of this world\n\n00:11:40.958 --> 00:11:42.958\nhave got this in their sights and I salute them.\n\n00:11:42.958 --> 00:11:44.958\nGo, go, go.\n\n00:11:44.958 --> 00:11:47.958\nThe next thing we need are places to stay on orbit.\n\n00:11:47.958 --> 00:11:50.958\nOrbital hotels to start with, but workshops for the rest of us later on.\n\n00:11:50.958 --> 00:11:56.958\nThe final missing piece, the real paradigm-buster, is this:\n\n00:11:56.958 --> 00:11:58.958\na gas station on orbit.\n\n00:11:59.958 --> 00:12:01.958\nIt's not going to look like that.\n\n00:12:01.958 --> 00:12:07.958\nIf it existed, it would change all future spacecraft design and space mission planning.\n\n00:12:07.958 --> 00:12:10.958\nNow, to give you a chance to understand\n\n00:12:10.958 --> 00:12:13.958\nwhy there is power in that statement,\n\n00:12:13.958 --> 00:12:15.958\nI've got to give you the basics of Space 101.\n\n00:12:15.958 --> 00:12:21.958\nAnd the first thing is everything you do in space you pay by the kilogram.\n\n00:12:23.958 --> 00:12:25.958\nAnybody drink one of these here this week?\n\n00:12:26.958 --> 00:12:30.958\nYou'd pay 10,000 dollars for that in orbit.\n\n00:12:30.958 --> 00:12:32.958\nThat's more than you pay for TED,\n\n00:12:32.958 --> 00:12:34.958\nif Google dropped their sponsorship.\n\n00:12:34.958 --> 00:12:36.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:12:37.958 --> 00:12:42.958\nThe second is more than 90 percent of the weight of a vehicle is in propellant.\n\n00:12:42.958 --> 00:12:46.958\nThus, every time you'd want to do anything in space,\n\n00:12:46.958 --> 00:12:50.958\nyou are literally blowing away enormous sums of money\n\n00:12:50.958 --> 00:12:52.958\nevery time you hit the accelerator.\n\n00:12:52.958 --> 00:12:55.958\nNot even the guys at Tesla can fight that physics.\n\n00:12:55.958 --> 00:13:00.958\nSo, what if you could get your gas at a 10th the price?\n\n00:13:01.958 --> 00:13:04.958\nThere is a place where you can.\n\n00:13:04.958 --> 00:13:07.958\nIn fact, you can get it better -- you can get it at 14 times lower\n\n00:13:07.958 --> 00:13:10.958\nif you can find propellant on the moon.\n\n00:13:10.958 --> 00:13:12.958\nThere is a little-known mission that was launched\n\n00:13:12.958 --> 00:13:16.958\nby the Pentagon, 13 years ago now, called Clementine.\n\n00:13:16.958 --> 00:13:18.958\nAnd the most amazing thing that came out of that mission\n\n00:13:19.958 --> 00:13:22.958\nwas a strong hydrogen signature at Shackleton crater\n\n00:13:22.958 --> 00:13:24.958\non the south pole of the moon.\n\n00:13:24.958 --> 00:13:26.958\nThat signal was so strong,\n\n00:13:26.958 --> 00:13:30.958\nit could only have been produced by 10 trillion tons of water\n\n00:13:30.958 --> 00:13:34.958\nburied in the sediment, collected over millions and billions of years\n\n00:13:34.958 --> 00:13:38.958\nby the impact of asteroids and comet material.\n\n00:13:41.958 --> 00:13:45.958\nIf we're going to get that, and make that gas station possible,\n\n00:13:45.958 --> 00:13:48.958\nwe have to figure out ways to move large volumes of payload through space.\n\n00:13:48.958 --> 00:13:50.958\nWe can't do that right now.\n\n00:13:50.958 --> 00:13:53.958\nThe way you normally build a system right now is you have a tube stack\n\n00:13:53.958 --> 00:13:55.958\nthat has to be launched from the ground,\n\n00:13:55.958 --> 00:13:57.958\nand resist all kinds of aerodynamic forces.\n\n00:13:57.958 --> 00:13:59.958\nWe have to beat that.\n\n00:13:59.958 --> 00:14:02.958\nWe can do it because in space there are no aerodynamics.\n\n00:14:02.958 --> 00:14:06.958\nWe can go and use inflatable systems for almost everything.\n\n00:14:06.958 --> 00:14:10.958\nThis is an idea that, again, came out of Livermore back in 1989,\n\n00:14:10.958 --> 00:14:12.958\nwith Dr. Lowell Wood's group.\n\n00:14:12.958 --> 00:14:16.958\nAnd we can extend that now to just about everything.\n\n00:14:16.958 --> 00:14:18.958\nBob Bigelow currently has a test article in the orbit.\n\n00:14:18.958 --> 00:14:19.958\nWe can go much further.\n\n00:14:19.958 --> 00:14:24.958\nWe can build space tugs, orbiting platforms for holding cryogens and water.\n\n00:14:24.958 --> 00:14:26.958\nThere's another thing.\n\n00:14:26.958 --> 00:14:28.958\nWhen you're coming back from the moon,\n\n00:14:28.958 --> 00:14:30.958\nyou have to deal with orbital mechanics.\n\n00:14:30.958 --> 00:14:32.958\nIt says you're moving 10,000 feet per second faster\n\n00:14:32.958 --> 00:14:35.958\nthan you really want to be to get back to your gas station.\n\n00:14:35.958 --> 00:14:37.958\nYou got two choices.\n\n00:14:37.958 --> 00:14:41.958\nYou can burn rocket fuel to get there, or you can do something really incredible.\n\n00:14:41.958 --> 00:14:43.958\nYou can dive into the stratosphere,\n\n00:14:43.958 --> 00:14:47.958\nand precisely dissipate that velocity, and come back out to the space station.\n\n00:14:47.958 --> 00:14:48.958\nIt has never been done.\n\n00:14:48.958 --> 00:14:52.958\nIt's risky and it's going to be one hell of a ride --\n\n00:14:52.958 --> 00:14:54.958\nbetter than Disney.\n\n00:14:54.958 --> 00:14:56.958\nThe traditional approach to space exploration\n\n00:14:56.958 --> 00:14:58.958\nhas been that you carry all the fuel you need\n\n00:14:58.958 --> 00:15:00.958\nto get everybody back in case of an emergency.\n\n00:15:00.958 --> 00:15:02.958\nIf you try to do that for the moon,\n\n00:15:02.958 --> 00:15:06.958\nyou're going to burn a billion dollars in fuel alone sending a crew out there.\n\n00:15:06.958 --> 00:15:08.958\nBut if you send a mining team there,\n\n00:15:08.958 --> 00:15:10.958\nwithout the return propellant, first --\n\n00:15:10.958 --> 00:15:14.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:15:15.958 --> 00:15:18.958\nDid any of you guys hear the story of Cortez?\n\n00:15:19.958 --> 00:15:21.958\nThis is not like that. I'm much more like Scotty.\n\n00:15:21.958 --> 00:15:24.958\nI like this equipment, you know, and I really value it\n\n00:15:24.958 --> 00:15:26.958\nso we're not going to burn the gear.\n\n00:15:26.958 --> 00:15:30.958\nBut, if you were truly bold you could get it there, manufacture it,\n\n00:15:30.958 --> 00:15:32.958\nand it would be the most dramatic demonstration\n\n00:15:32.958 --> 00:15:34.958\nthat you could do something worthwhile off this planet\n\n00:15:34.958 --> 00:15:36.958\nthat has ever been done.\n\n00:15:36.958 --> 00:15:39.958\nThere's a myth that you can't do anything in space\n\n00:15:39.958 --> 00:15:43.958\nfor less than a trillion dollars and 20 years.\n\n00:15:43.958 --> 00:15:44.958\nThat's not true.\n\n00:15:44.958 --> 00:15:46.958\nIn seven years, we could pull off\n\n00:15:46.958 --> 00:15:48.958\nan industrial mission to Shackleton and demonstrate\n\n00:15:48.958 --> 00:15:52.958\nthat you could provide commercial reality out of this in low-earth orbit.\n\n00:15:53.958 --> 00:15:56.958\nWe're living in one of the most exciting times in history.\n\n00:15:56.958 --> 00:15:58.958\nWe're at a magical confluence where private wealth\n\n00:15:58.958 --> 00:16:02.958\nand imagination are driving the demand for access to space.\n\n00:16:02.958 --> 00:16:05.958\nThe orbital refueling stations I've just described\n\n00:16:05.958 --> 00:16:08.958\ncould create an entirely new industry and provide the final key\n\n00:16:08.958 --> 00:16:12.958\nfor opening space to the general exploration.\n\n00:16:12.958 --> 00:16:16.958\nTo bust the paradigm a radically different approach is needed.\n\n00:16:16.958 --> 00:16:18.958\nWe can do it by jump-starting with an industrial\n\n00:16:18.958 --> 00:16:21.958\nLewis and Clark expedition to Shackleton crater,\n\n00:16:21.958 --> 00:16:23.958\nto mine the moon for resources, and demonstrate\n\n00:16:23.958 --> 00:16:27.958\nthey can form the basis for a profitable business on orbit.\n\n00:16:27.958 --> 00:16:30.958\nTalk about space always seems to be hung on ambiguities\n\n00:16:30.958 --> 00:16:32.958\nof purpose and timing.\n\n00:16:32.958 --> 00:16:36.958\nI would like to close here by putting a stake in the sand at TED.\n\n00:16:37.958 --> 00:16:39.958\nI intend to lead that expedition.\n\n00:16:39.958 --> 00:16:47.958\n(Applause)\n\n00:16:47.958 --> 00:16:50.958\nIt can be done in seven years with the right backing.\n\n00:16:50.958 --> 00:16:54.958\nThose who join me in making it happen will become a part of history\n\n00:16:54.958 --> 00:16:56.958\nand join other bold individuals from time past\n\n00:16:56.958 --> 00:17:00.958\nwho, had they been here today, would have heartily approved.\n\n00:17:01.958 --> 00:17:06.958\nThere was once a time when people did bold things to open the frontier.\n\n00:17:06.958 --> 00:17:10.958\nWe have collectively forgotten that lesson.\n\n00:17:11.958 --> 00:17:15.958\nNow we're at a time when boldness is required to move forward.\n\n00:17:17.958 --> 00:17:21.958\n100 years after Sir Ernest Shackleton wrote these words,\n\n00:17:21.958 --> 00:17:23.958\nI intend to plant an industrial flag on the moon\n\n00:17:23.958 --> 00:17:26.958\nand complete the final piece\n\n00:17:26.958 --> 00:17:30.958\nthat will open the space frontier, in our time, for all of us.\n\n00:17:30.958 --> 00:17:31.958\nThank you.\n\n00:17:31.958 --> 00:17:39.958\n(Applause)"}, {"title": "Dangerous memes", "duration": "926", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/dan_dennett_on_dangerous_memes", "transcript": "How many Creationists do we have in the room? Probably none. I think we're all Darwinians. And yet many Darwinians are anxious, a little uneasy \u2014 would like to see some limits on just how far the Darwinism goes. It's all right. You know spiderwebs? Sure, they are products of evolution. The World Wide Web? Not so sure. Beaver dams, yes. Hoover Dam, no. What do they think it is that prevents the products of human ingenuity from being themselves, fruits of the tree of life, and hence, in some sense, obeying evolutionary rules? And yet people are interestingly resistant to the idea of applying evolutionary thinking to thinking \u2014 to our thinking.And so I'm going to talk a little bit about that, keeping in mind that we have a lot on the program here. So you're out in the woods, or you're out in the pasture, and you see this ant crawling up this blade of grass. It climbs up to the top, and it falls, and it climbs, and it falls, and it climbs \u2014 trying to stay at the very top of the blade of grass. What is this ant doing? What is this in aid of? What goals is this ant trying to achieve by climbing this blade of grass? What's in it for the ant? And the answer is: nothing. There's nothing in it for the ant. Well then, why is it doing this? Is it just a fluke? Yeah, it's just a fluke. It's a lancet fluke. It's a little brain worm. It's a parasitic brain worm that has to get into the stomach of a sheep or a cow in order to continue its life cycle. Salmon swim upstream to get to their spawning grounds, and lancet flukes commandeer a passing ant, crawl into its brain, and drive it up a blade of grass like an all-terrain vehicle. So there's nothing in it for the ant. The ant's brain has been hijacked by a parasite that infects the brain, inducing suicidal behavior. Pretty scary.Well, does anything like that happen with human beings? This is all on behalf of a cause other than one's own genetic fitness, of course. Well, it may already have occurred to you that Islam means \"surrender,\" or \"submission of self-interest to the will of Allah.\" Well, it's ideas \u2014 not worms \u2014 that hijack our brains. Now, am I saying that a sizable minority of the world's population has had their brain hijacked by parasitic ideas? No, it's worse than that. Most people have. (Laughter) There are a lot of ideas to die for. Freedom, if you're from New Hampshire. (Laughter) Justice. Truth. Communism. Many people have laid down their lives for communism, and many have laid down their lives for capitalism. And many for Catholicism. And many for Islam. These are just a few of the ideas that are to die for. They're infectious.Yesterday, Amory Lovins spoke about \"infectious repititis.\" It was a term of abuse, in effect. This is unthinking engineering. Well, most of the cultural spread that goes on is not brilliant, new, out-of-the-box thinking. It's \"infectious repetitis,\" and we might as well try to have a theory of what's going on when that happens so that we can understand the conditions of infection. Hosts work hard to spread these ideas to others. I myself am a philosopher, and one of our occupational hazards is that people ask us what the meaning of life is. And you have to have a bumper sticker, you know. You have to have a statement. So, this is mine.The secret of happiness is: Find something more important than you are and dedicate your life to it. Most of us \u2014 now that the \"Me Decade\" is well in the past \u2014 now we actually do this. One set of ideas or another have simply replaced our biological imperatives in our own lives. This is what our summum bonum is. It's not maximizing the number of grandchildren we have. Now, this is a profound biological effect. It's the subordination of genetic interest to other interests. And no other species does anything at all like it.Well, how are we going to think about this? It is, on the one hand, a biological effect, and a very large one. Unmistakable. Now, what theories do we want to use to look at this? Well, many theories. But how could something tie them together? The idea of replicating ideas; ideas that replicate by passing from brain to brain. Richard Dawkins, whom you'll be hearing later in the day, invented the term \"memes,\" and put forward the first really clear and vivid version of this idea in his book \"The Selfish Gene.\" Now here am I talking about his idea. Well, you see, it's not his. Yes \u2014 he started it. But it's everybody's idea now. And he's not responsible for what I say about memes. I'm responsible for what I say about memes.Actually, I think we're all responsible for not just the intended effects of our ideas, but for their likely misuses. So it is important, I think, to Richard, and to me, that these ideas not be abused and misused. They're very easy to misuse. That's why they're dangerous. And it's just about a full-time job trying to prevent people who are scared of these ideas from caricaturing them and then running off to one dire purpose or another. So we have to keep plugging away, trying to correct the misapprehensions so that only the benign and useful variants of our ideas continue to spread. But it is a problem. We don't have much time, and I'm going to go over just a little bit of this and cut out, because there's a lot of other things that are going to be said.So let me just point out: memes are like viruses. That's what Richard said, back in '93. And you might think, \"Well, how can that be? I mean, a virus is \u2014 you know, it's stuff! What's a meme made of?\" Yesterday, Negroponte was talking about viral telecommunications but \u2014 what's a virus? A virus is a string of nucleic acid with attitude. (Laughter) That is, there is something about it that tends to make it replicate better than the competition does. And that's what a meme is. It's an information packet with attitude. What's a meme made of? What are bits made of, Mom? Not silicon. They're made of information, and can be carried in any physical medium. What's a word made of? Sometimes when people say, \"Do memes exist?\" I say, \"Well, do words exist? Are they in your ontology?\" If they are, words are memes that can be pronounced.Then there's all the other memes that can't be pronounced. There are different species of memes. Remember the Shakers? Gift to be simple? Simple, beautiful furniture? And, of course, they're basically extinct now. And one of the reasons is that among the creed of Shaker-dom is that one should be celibate. Not just the priests. Everybody. Well, it's not so surprising that they've gone extinct. (Laughter) But in fact that's not why they went extinct. They survived as long as they did at a time when the social safety nets weren't there. And there were lots of widows and orphans, people like that, who needed a foster home. And so they had a ready supply of converts. And they could keep it going. And, in principle, it could've gone on forever, with perfect celibacy on the part of the hosts. The idea being passed on through proselytizing, instead of through the gene line.So the ideas can live on in spite of the fact that they're not being passed on genetically. A meme can flourish in spite of having a negative impact on genetic fitness. After all, the meme for Shaker-dom was essentially a sterilizing parasite. There are other parasites that do this \u2014 which render the host sterile. It's part of their plan. They don't have to have minds to have a plan.I'm just going to draw your attention to just one of the many implications of the memetic perspective, which I recommend. I've not time to go into more of it. In Jared Diamond's wonderful book, \"Guns, Germs and Steel,\" he talks about how it was germs, more than guns and steel, that conquered the new hemisphere \u2014 the Western hemisphere \u2014 that conquered the rest of the world. When European explorers and travelers spread out, they brought with them the germs that they had become essentially immune to, that they had learned how to tolerate over hundreds and hundreds of years, thousands of years, of living with domesticated animals who were the sources of those pathogens. And they just wiped out \u2014 these pathogens just wiped out the native people, who had no immunity to them at all.And we're doing it again. We're doing it this time with toxic ideas. Yesterday, a number of people \u2014 Nicholas Negroponte and others \u2014 spoke about all the wonderful things that are happening when our ideas get spread out, thanks to all the new technology all over the world. And I agree. It is largely wonderful. Largely wonderful. But among all those ideas that inevitably flow out into the whole world thanks to our technology, are a lot of toxic ideas. Now, this has been realized for some time. Sayyid Qutb is one of the founding fathers of fanatical Islam, one of the ideologues that inspired Osama bin Laden. \"One has only to glance at its press films, fashion shows, beauty contests, ballrooms, wine bars and broadcasting stations.\" Memes.These memes are spreading around the world and they are wiping out whole cultures. They are wiping out languages. They are wiping out traditions and practices. And it's not our fault, anymore than it's our fault when our germs lay waste to people that haven't developed the immunity. We have an immunity to all of the junk that lies around the edges of our culture. We're a free society, so we let pornography and all these things \u2014 we shrug them off. They're like a mild cold. They're not a big deal for us. But we should recognize that for many people in the world, they are a big deal. And we should be very alert to this. As we spread our education and our technology, one of the things that we are doing is we're the vectors of memes that are correctly viewed by the hosts of many other memes as a dire threat to their favorite memes \u2014 the memes that they are prepared to die for.Well now, how are we going to tell the good memes from the bad memes? That is not the job of the science of memetics. Memetics is morally neutral. And so it should be. This is not the place for hate and anger. If you've had a friend who's died of AIDS, then you hate HIV. But the way to deal with that is to do science, and understand how it spreads and why in a morally neutral perspective.Get the facts. Work out the implications. There's plenty of room for moral passion once we've got the facts and can figure out the best thing to do. And, as with germs, the trick is not to try to annihilate them. You will never annihilate the germs. What you can do, however, is foster public health measures and the like that will encourage the evolution of avirulence. That will encourage the spread of relatively benign mutations of the most toxic varieties. That's all the time I have, so thank you very much for your attention.", "id": 116, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:11.958 --> 00:00:14.958\nHow many Creationists do we have in the room?\n\n00:00:14.958 --> 00:00:17.958\nProbably none.

It's a lancet fluke.\n\n00:02:04.958 --> 00:02:06.958\nIt's a little brain worm.\n\n00:02:06.958 --> 00:02:11.958\nIt's a parasitic brain worm that has to get into the stomach of a sheep or a cow\n\n00:02:11.958 --> 00:02:14.958\nin order to continue its life cycle.\n\n00:02:14.958 --> 00:02:19.958\nSalmon swim upstream to get to their spawning grounds,\n\n00:02:19.958 --> 00:02:23.958\nand lancet flukes commandeer a passing ant,\n\n00:02:23.958 --> 00:02:28.958\ncrawl into its brain, and drive it up a blade of grass like an all-terrain vehicle.\n\n00:02:28.958 --> 00:02:32.958\nSo there's nothing in it for the ant.\n\n00:02:32.958 --> 00:02:40.958\nThe ant's brain has been hijacked by a parasite that infects the brain,\n\n00:02:40.958 --> 00:02:43.958\ninducing suicidal behavior.\n\n00:02:44.958 --> 00:02:46.958\nPretty scary.\n\n00:02:46.958 --> 00:02:50.958\nWell, does anything like that happen with human beings?\n\n00:02:51.958 --> 00:02:56.958\nThis is all on behalf of a cause other than one's own genetic fitness, of course.\n\n00:02:56.958 --> 00:03:01.958\nWell, it may already have occurred to you\n\n00:03:01.958 --> 00:03:11.958\nthat Islam means \"surrender,\" or \"submission of self-interest to the will of Allah.\"\n\n00:03:11.958 --> 00:03:17.958\nWell, it's ideas -- not worms -- that hijack our brains.\n\n00:03:17.958 --> 00:03:22.958\nNow, am I saying that a sizable minority of the world's population\n\n00:03:22.958 --> 00:03:28.958\nhas had their brain hijacked by parasitic ideas?\n\n00:03:29.958 --> 00:03:31.958\nNo, it's worse than that.\n\n00:03:31.958 --> 00:03:35.958\nMost people have.\n\n00:03:35.958 --> 00:03:37.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:03:39.958 --> 00:03:41.958\nThere are a lot of ideas to die for.\n\n00:03:41.958 --> 00:03:44.958\nFreedom, if you're from New Hampshire.\n\n00:03:44.958 --> 00:03:47.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:03:48.958 --> 00:03:52.958\nJustice. Truth. Communism.\n\n00:03:52.958 --> 00:03:55.958\nMany people have laid down their lives for communism,\n\n00:03:55.958 --> 00:03:58.958\nand many have laid down their lives for capitalism.\n\n00:03:58.958 --> 00:04:02.958\nAnd many for Catholicism. And many for Islam.\n\n00:04:02.958 --> 00:04:07.958\nThese are just a few of the ideas that are to die for.\n\n00:04:07.958 --> 00:04:09.958\nThey're infectious.\n\n00:04:10.958 --> 00:04:14.958\nYesterday, Amory Lovins spoke about \"infectious repititis.\"\n\n00:04:14.958 --> 00:04:17.958\nIt was a term of abuse, in effect.\n\n00:04:17.958 --> 00:04:19.958\nThis is unthinking engineering.\n\n00:04:19.958 --> 00:04:23.958\nWell, most of the cultural spread that goes on\n\n00:04:23.958 --> 00:04:27.958\nis not brilliant, new, out-of-the-box thinking.\n\n00:04:27.958 --> 00:04:29.958\nIt's \"infectious repetitis,\"\n\n00:04:29.958 --> 00:04:34.958\nand we might as well try to have a theory of what's going on when that happens\n\n00:04:34.958 --> 00:04:38.958\nso that we can understand the conditions of infection.\n\n00:04:40.958 --> 00:04:47.958\nHosts work hard to spread these ideas to others.\n\n00:04:47.958 --> 00:04:53.958\nI myself am a philosopher, and one of our occupational hazards\n\n00:04:53.958 --> 00:04:57.958\nis that people ask us what the meaning of life is.\n\n00:04:57.958 --> 00:05:00.958\nAnd you have to have a bumper sticker,\n\n00:05:00.958 --> 00:05:03.958\nyou know. You have to have a statement.\n\n00:05:03.958 --> 00:05:05.958\nSo, this is mine.\n\n00:05:05.958 --> 00:05:09.958\nThe secret of happiness is: Find something more important than you are\n\n00:05:09.958 --> 00:05:11.958\nand dedicate your life to it.\n\n00:05:11.958 --> 00:05:15.958\nMost of us -- now that the \"Me Decade\" is well in the past --\n\n00:05:15.958 --> 00:05:17.958\nnow we actually do this.\n\n00:05:17.958 --> 00:05:20.958\nOne set of ideas or another\n\n00:05:20.958 --> 00:05:24.958\nhave simply replaced our biological imperatives in our own lives.\n\n00:05:24.958 --> 00:05:27.958\nThis is what our summum bonum is.\n\n00:05:27.958 --> 00:05:30.958\nIt's not maximizing the number of grandchildren we have.\n\n00:05:30.958 --> 00:05:34.958\nNow, this is a profound biological effect.\n\n00:05:34.958 --> 00:05:37.958\nIt's the subordination of genetic interest to other interests.\n\n00:05:37.958 --> 00:05:41.958\nAnd no other species does anything at all like it.\n\n00:05:41.958 --> 00:05:43.958\nWell, how are we going to think about this?\n\n00:05:43.958 --> 00:05:47.958\nIt is, on the one hand, a biological effect, and a very large one.\n\n00:05:47.958 --> 00:05:49.958\nUnmistakable.\n\n00:05:49.958 --> 00:05:52.958\nNow, what theories do we want to use to look at this?\n\n00:05:52.958 --> 00:05:55.958\nWell, many theories. But how could something tie them together?\n\n00:05:55.958 --> 00:05:58.958\nThe idea of replicating ideas;\n\n00:05:58.958 --> 00:06:03.958\nideas that replicate by passing from brain to brain.\n\n00:06:03.958 --> 00:06:08.958\nRichard Dawkins, whom you'll be hearing later in the day, invented the term \"memes,\"\n\n00:06:08.958 --> 00:06:13.958\nand put forward the first really clear and vivid version of this idea\n\n00:06:13.958 --> 00:06:15.958\nin his book \"The Selfish Gene.\"\n\n00:06:15.958 --> 00:06:18.958\nNow here am I talking about his idea.\n\n00:06:18.958 --> 00:06:24.958\nWell, you see, it's not his. Yes -- he started it.\n\n00:06:24.958 --> 00:06:27.958\nBut it's everybody's idea now.\n\n00:06:27.958 --> 00:06:31.958\nAnd he's not responsible for what I say about memes.\n\n00:06:31.958 --> 00:06:35.958\nI'm responsible for what I say about memes.\n\n00:06:36.958 --> 00:06:39.958\nActually, I think we're all responsible\n\n00:06:39.958 --> 00:06:45.958\nfor not just the intended effects of our ideas,\n\n00:06:45.958 --> 00:06:48.958\nbut for their likely misuses.\n\n00:06:49.958 --> 00:06:53.958\nSo it is important, I think, to Richard, and to me,\n\n00:06:53.958 --> 00:06:57.958\nthat these ideas not be abused and misused.\n\n00:06:57.958 --> 00:07:00.958\nThey're very easy to misuse. That's why they're dangerous.\n\n00:07:00.958 --> 00:07:03.958\nAnd it's just about a full-time job\n\n00:07:03.958 --> 00:07:06.958\ntrying to prevent people who are scared of these ideas\n\n00:07:06.958 --> 00:07:14.958\nfrom caricaturing them and then running off to one dire purpose or another.\n\n00:07:14.958 --> 00:07:17.958\nSo we have to keep plugging away,\n\n00:07:17.958 --> 00:07:19.958\ntrying to correct the misapprehensions\n\n00:07:19.958 --> 00:07:27.958\nso that only the benign and useful variants of our ideas continue to spread.\n\n00:07:27.958 --> 00:07:29.958\nBut it is a problem.\n\n00:07:31.958 --> 00:07:36.958\nWe don't have much time, and I'm going to go over just a little bit of this and cut out,\n\n00:07:36.958 --> 00:07:39.958\nbecause there's a lot of other things that are going to be said.\n\n00:07:39.958 --> 00:07:44.958\nSo let me just point out: memes are like viruses.\n\n00:07:44.958 --> 00:07:46.958\nThat's what Richard said, back in '93.\n\n00:07:46.958 --> 00:07:48.958\nAnd you might think, \"Well, how can that be?\n\n00:07:48.958 --> 00:07:55.958\nI mean, a virus is -- you know, it's stuff! What's a meme made of?\"\n\n00:07:55.958 --> 00:08:00.958\nYesterday, Negroponte was talking about viral telecommunications\n\n00:08:00.958 --> 00:08:01.958\nbut -- what's a virus?\n\n00:08:01.958 --> 00:08:05.958\nA virus is a string of nucleic acid with attitude.\n\n00:08:05.958 --> 00:08:06.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:08:06.958 --> 00:08:08.958\nThat is, there is something about it\n\n00:08:08.958 --> 00:08:12.958\nthat tends to make it replicate better than the competition does.\n\n00:08:12.958 --> 00:08:16.958\nAnd that's what a meme is. It's an information packet with attitude.\n\n00:08:16.958 --> 00:08:22.958\nWhat's a meme made of? What are bits made of, Mom?\n\n00:08:22.958 --> 00:08:24.958\nNot silicon.\n\n00:08:24.958 --> 00:08:28.958\nThey're made of information, and can be carried in any physical medium.\n\n00:08:28.958 --> 00:08:30.958\nWhat's a word made of?\n\n00:08:30.958 --> 00:08:35.958\nSometimes when people say, \"Do memes exist?\"\n\n00:08:35.958 --> 00:08:39.958\nI say, \"Well, do words exist? Are they in your ontology?\"\n\n00:08:39.958 --> 00:08:44.958\nIf they are, words are memes that can be pronounced.\n\n00:08:44.958 --> 00:08:47.958\nThen there's all the other memes that can't be pronounced.\n\n00:08:47.958 --> 00:08:50.958\nThere are different species of memes.\n\n00:08:55.958 --> 00:08:59.958\nRemember the Shakers? Gift to be simple?\n\n00:08:59.958 --> 00:09:02.958\nSimple, beautiful furniture?\n\n00:09:02.958 --> 00:09:05.958\nAnd, of course, they're basically extinct now.\n\n00:09:05.958 --> 00:09:11.958\nAnd one of the reasons is that among the creed of Shaker-dom\n\n00:09:11.958 --> 00:09:13.958\nis that one should be celibate.\n\n00:09:13.958 --> 00:09:15.958\nNot just the priests. Everybody.\n\n00:09:15.958 --> 00:09:23.958\nWell, it's not so surprising that they've gone extinct. (Laughter)\n\n00:09:23.958 --> 00:09:26.958\nBut in fact that's not why they went extinct.\n\n00:09:28.958 --> 00:09:31.958\nThey survived as long as they did\n\n00:09:31.958 --> 00:09:33.958\nat a time when the social safety nets weren't there.\n\n00:09:33.958 --> 00:09:36.958\nAnd there were lots of widows and orphans,\n\n00:09:36.958 --> 00:09:39.958\npeople like that, who needed a foster home.\n\n00:09:39.958 --> 00:09:42.958\nAnd so they had a ready supply of converts.\n\n00:09:42.958 --> 00:09:44.958\nAnd they could keep it going.\n\n00:09:44.958 --> 00:09:46.958\nAnd, in principle, it could've gone on forever,\n\n00:09:46.958 --> 00:09:49.958\nwith perfect celibacy on the part of the hosts.\n\n00:09:49.958 --> 00:09:54.958\nThe idea being passed on through proselytizing,\n\n00:09:54.958 --> 00:09:57.958\ninstead of through the gene line.\n\n00:09:59.958 --> 00:10:03.958\nSo the ideas can live on in spite of the fact\n\n00:10:03.958 --> 00:10:06.958\nthat they're not being passed on genetically.\n\n00:10:06.958 --> 00:10:10.958\nA meme can flourish in spite of having a negative impact on genetic fitness.\n\n00:10:10.958 --> 00:10:18.958\nAfter all, the meme for Shaker-dom was essentially a sterilizing parasite.\n\n00:10:19.958 --> 00:10:25.958\nThere are other parasites that do this -- which render the host sterile.\n\n00:10:26.958 --> 00:10:28.958\nIt's part of their plan.\n\n00:10:28.958 --> 00:10:32.958\nThey don't have to have minds to have a plan.\n\n00:10:33.958 --> 00:10:38.958\nI'm just going to draw your attention to just one\n\n00:10:38.958 --> 00:10:46.958\nof the many implications of the memetic perspective, which I recommend.\n\n00:10:47.958 --> 00:10:49.958\nI've not time to go into more of it.\n\n00:10:49.958 --> 00:10:53.958\nIn Jared Diamond's wonderful book, \"Guns, Germs and Steel,\"\n\n00:10:53.958 --> 00:10:59.958\nhe talks about how it was germs, more than guns and steel,\n\n00:10:59.958 --> 00:11:04.958\nthat conquered the new hemisphere -- the Western hemisphere --\n\n00:11:04.958 --> 00:11:06.958\nthat conquered the rest of the world.\n\n00:11:06.958 --> 00:11:13.958\nWhen European explorers and travelers spread out,\n\n00:11:13.958 --> 00:11:15.958\nthey brought with them the germs\n\n00:11:15.958 --> 00:11:18.958\nthat they had become essentially immune to,\n\n00:11:18.958 --> 00:11:21.958\nthat they had learned how to tolerate over\n\n00:11:21.958 --> 00:11:24.958\nhundreds and hundreds of years, thousands of years,\n\n00:11:24.958 --> 00:11:28.958\nof living with domesticated animals who were the sources of those pathogens.\n\n00:11:29.958 --> 00:11:34.958\nAnd they just wiped out -- these pathogens just wiped out the native people,\n\n00:11:34.958 --> 00:11:37.958\nwho had no immunity to them at all.\n\n00:11:37.958 --> 00:11:40.958\nAnd we're doing it again.\n\n00:11:41.958 --> 00:11:45.958\nWe're doing it this time with toxic ideas.\n\n00:11:46.958 --> 00:11:50.958\nYesterday, a number of people -- Nicholas Negroponte and others --\n\n00:11:50.958 --> 00:11:52.958\nspoke about all the wonderful things\n\n00:11:52.958 --> 00:11:55.958\nthat are happening when our ideas get spread out,\n\n00:11:55.958 --> 00:11:57.958\nthanks to all the new technology all over the world.\n\n00:11:57.958 --> 00:12:03.958\nAnd I agree.

When we go to the physician today \u2014 when we go to the doctor's office and we walk in, there are words that we just don't want to hear. There are words that we're truly afraid of. Diabetes, cancer, Parkinson's, Alzheimer's, heart failure, lung failure \u2014 things that we know are debilitating diseases, for which there's relatively little that can be done.And what I want to lay out for you today is a different way of thinking about how to treat debilitating disease, why it's important, why without it perhaps our health care system will melt down if you think it already hasn't, and where we are clinically today, and where we might go tomorrow, and what some of the hurdles are. And we're going to do all of that in 18 minutes, I promise.I want to start with this slide, because this slide sort of tells the story the way Science Magazine thinks of it. This was an issue from 2002 that they published with a lot of different articles on the bionic human. It was basically a regenerative medicine issue. Regenerative medicine is an extraordinarily simple concept that everybody can understand. It's simply accelerating the pace at which the body heals itself to a clinically relevant timescale. So we know how to do this in many of the ways that are up there. We know that if we have a damaged hip, you can put an artificial hip in. And this is the idea that Science Magazine used on their front cover.This is the complete antithesis of regenerative medicine. This is not regenerative medicine. Regenerative medicine is what Business Week put up when they did a story about regenerative medicine not too long ago. The idea is that instead of figuring out how to ameliorate symptoms with devices and drugs and the like \u2014 and I'll come back to that theme a few times \u2014 instead of doing that, we will regenerate lost function of the body by regenerating the function of organs and damaged tissue. So that at the end of the treatment, you are the same as you were at the beginning of the treatment.Very few good ideas \u2014 if you agree that this is a good idea \u2014 very few good ideas are truly novel. And this is just the same. If you look back in history, Charles Lindbergh, who was better known for flying airplanes, was actually one of the first people along with Alexis Carrel, one of the Nobel Laureates from Rockefeller, to begin to think about, could you culture organs? And they published this book in 1937, where they actually began to think about, what could you do in bio-reactors to grow whole organs? We've come a long way since then. I'm going to share with you some of the exciting work that's going on.But before doing that, what I'd like to do is share my depression about the health care system and the need for this with you. Many of the talks yesterday talked about improving the quality of life, and reducing poverty, and essentially increasing life expectancy all around the globe. One of the challenges is that the richer we are, the longer we live. And the longer we live, the more expensive it is to take care of our diseases as we get older.This is simply the wealth of a country versus the percent of population over the age of 65. And you can basically see that the richer a country is, the older the people are within it. Why is this important? And why is this a particularly dramatic challenge right now? If the average age of your population is 30, then the average kind of disease that you have to treat is maybe a broken ankle every now and again, maybe a little bit of asthma. If the average age in your country is 45 to 55, now the average person is looking at diabetes, early-onset diabetes, heart failure, coronary artery disease \u2014 things that are inherently more difficult to treat, and much more expensive to treat.Just have a look at the demographics in the U.S. here. This is from \"The Untied States of America.\" In 1930, there were 41 workers per retiree. 41 people who were basically outside of being really sick, paying for the one retiree who was experiencing debilitating disease. In 2010, two workers per retiree in the U.S. And this is matched in every industrialized, wealthy country in the world. How can you actually afford to treat patients when the reality of getting old looks like this?This is age versus cost of health care. And you can see that right around age 45, 40 to 45, there's a sudden spike in the cost of health care. It's actually quite interesting. If you do the right studies, you can look at how much you as an individual spend on your own health care, plotted over your lifetime. And about seven years before you're about to die, there's a spike. And you can actually \u2014 (Laughter) \u2014 we won't get into that. (Laughter)There are very few things, very few things that you can really do that will change the way that you can treat these kinds of diseases and experience what I would call healthy aging. I'd suggest there are four things, and none of these things include an insurance system or a legal system. All those things do is change who pays. They don't actually change what the actual cost of the treatment is.One thing you can do is not treat. You can ration health care. We won't talk about that anymore. It's too depressing. You can prevent. Obviously a lot of monies should be put into prevention.But perhaps most interesting, to me anyway, and most important, is the idea of diagnosing a disease much earlier on in the progression, and then treating the disease to cure the disease instead of treating a symptom. Think of it in terms of diabetes, for instance. Today, with diabetes, what do we do? We diagnose the disease eventually, once it becomes symptomatic, and then we treat the symptom for 10, 20, 30, 40 years. And we do OK. Insulin's a pretty good therapy. But eventually it stops working, and diabetes leads to a predictable onset of debilitating disease.Why couldn't we just inject the pancreas with something to regenerate the pancreas early on in the disease, perhaps even before it was symptomatic? And it might be a little bit expensive at the time that we did it, but if it worked, we would truly be able to do something different.This video, I think, gets across the concept that I'm talking about quite dramatically. This is a newt re-growing its limb. If a newt can do this kind of thing, why can't we? I'll actually show you some more important features about limb regeneration in a moment. But what we're talking about in regenerative medicine is doing this in every organ system of the body, for tissues and for organs themselves. So today's reality is that if we get sick, the message is we will treat your symptoms, and you need to adjust to a new way of life.I would pose to you that tomorrow \u2014 and when tomorrow is we could debate, but it's within the foreseeable future \u2014 we will talk about regenerative rehabilitation. There's a limb prosthetic up here, similar actually one on the soldier that's come back from Iraq. There are 370 soldiers that have come back from Iraq that have lost limbs. Imagine if instead of facing that, they could actually face the regeneration of that limb. It's a wild concept. I'll show you where we are at the moment in working towards that concept.But it's applicable, again, to every organ system. How can we do that? The way to do that is to develop a conversation with the body. We need to learn to speak the body's language. And to switch on processes that we knew how to do when we were a fetus. A mammalian fetus, if it loses a limb during the first trimester of pregnancy, will re-grow that limb. So our DNA has the capacity to do these kinds of wound-healing mechanisms. It's a natural process, but it is lost as we age. In a child, before the age of about six months, if they lose their fingertip in an accident, they'll re-grow their fingertip. By the time they're five, they won't be able to do that anymore.So to engage in that conversation with the body, we need to speak the body's language. And there are certain tools in our toolbox that allow us to do this today. I'm going to give you an example of three of these tools through which to converse with the body.The first is cellular therapies. Clearly, we heal ourselves in a natural process, using cells to do most of the work. Therefore, if we can find the right cells and implant them in the body, they may do the healing. Secondly, we can use materials. We heard yesterday about the importance of new materials. If we can invent materials, design materials, or extract materials from a natural environment, then we might be able to have those materials induce the body to heal itself. And finally, we may be able to use smart devices that will offload the work of the body and allow it to heal.I'm going to show you an example of each of these, and I'm going to start with materials. Steve Badylak \u2014 who's at the University of Pittsburgh \u2014 about a decade ago had a remarkable idea. And that idea was that the small intestine of a pig, if you threw away all the cells, and if you did that in a way that allowed it to remain biologically active, may contain all of the necessary factors and signals that would signal the body to heal itself. And he asked a very important question. He asked the question, if I take that material, which is a natural material that usually induces healing in the small intestine, and I place it somewhere else on a person's body, would it give a tissue-specific response, or would it make small intestine if I tried to make a new ear?I wouldn't be telling you this story if it weren't compelling. The picture I'm about to show you is a compelling picture. (Laughter) However, for those of you that are even the slightest bit squeamish \u2014 even though you may not like to admit it in front of your friends \u2014 the lights are down. This is a good time to look at your feet, check your Blackberry, do anything other than look at the screen. (Laughter)What I'm about to show you is a diabetic ulcer. And although \u2014 it's good to laugh before we look at this. This is the reality of diabetes. I think a lot of times we hear about diabetics, diabetic ulcers, we just don't connect the ulcer with the eventual treatment, which is amputation, if you can't heal it. So I'm going to put the slide up now. It won't be up for long. This is a diabetic ulcer. It's tragic. The treatment for this is amputation. This is an older lady. She has cancer of the liver as well as diabetes, and has decided to die with what' s left of her body intact.And this lady decided, after a year of attempted treatment of that ulcer, that she would try this new therapy that Steve invented. That's what the wound looked like 11 weeks later. That material contained only natural signals. And that material induced the body to switch back on a healing response that it didn't have before.There's going to be a couple more distressing slides for those of you \u2014 I'll let you know when you can look again. This is a horse. The horse is not in pain. If the horse was in pain, I wouldn't show you this slide. The horse just has another nostril that's developed because of a riding accident. Just a few weeks after treatment \u2014 in this case, taking that material, turning it into a gel, and packing that area, and then repeating the treatment a few times \u2014 and the horse heals up. And if you took an ultrasound of that area, it would look great.Here's a dolphin where the fin's been re-attached. There are now 400,000 patients around the world who have used that material to heal their wounds. Could you regenerate a limb? DARPA just gave Steve 15 million dollars to lead an eight-institution project to begin the process of asking that question.And I'll show you the 15 million dollar picture. This is a 78 year-old man who's lost the end of his fingertip. Remember that I mentioned before the children who lose their fingertips. After treatment that's what it looks like. This is happening today. This is clinically relevant today. There are materials that do this. Here are the heart patches.But could you go a little further? Could you, say, instead of using material, can I take some cells along with the material, and remove a damaged piece of tissue, put a bio-degradable material on there? You can see here a little bit of heart muscle beating in a dish. This was done by Teruo Okano at Tokyo Women's Hospital. He can actually grow beating tissue in a dish. He chills the dish, it changes its properties and he peels it right out of the dish. It's the coolest stuff.Now I'm going to show you cell-based regeneration. And what I'm going to show you here is stem cells being removed from the hip of a patient. Again, if you're squeamish, you don't want to watch. But this one's kind of cool. So this is a bypass operation, just like what Al Gore had, with a difference. In this case, at the end of the bypass operation, you're going to see the stem cells from the patient that were removed at the beginning of the procedure being injected directly into the heart of the patient. And I'm standing up here because at one point I'm going to show you just how early this technology is. Here go the stem cells, right into the beating heart of the patient. And if you look really carefully, it's going to be right around this point you'll actually see a back-flush. You see the cells coming back out. We need all sorts of new technology, new devices, to get the cells to the right place at the right time.Just a little bit of data, a tiny bit of data. This was a randomized trial. At this time this was an N of 20. Now there's an N of about 100. Basically, if you take an extremely sick patient and you give them a bypass, they get a little bit better. If you give them stem cells as well as their bypass, for these particular patients, they became asymptomatic. These are now two years out. The coolest thing would be is if you could diagnose the disease early, and prevent the onset of the disease to a bad state.This is the same procedure, but now done minimally invasively, with only three holes in the body where they're taking the heart and simply injecting stem cells through a laparoscopic procedure. There go the cells. We don't have time to go into all of those details, but basically, that works too. You can take patients who are less sick, and bring them back to an almost asymptomatic state through that kind of therapy.Here's another example of stem-cell therapy that isn't quite clinical yet, but I think very soon will be. This is the work of Kacey Marra from Pittsburgh, along with a number of colleagues around the world. They've decided that liposuction fluid, which \u2014 in the United States, we have a lot of liposuction fluid. (Laughter) It's a great source of stem cells. Stem cells are packed in that liposuction fluid. So you could go in, you could get your tummy-tuck. Out comes the liposuction fluid, and in this case, the stem cells are isolated and turned into neurons. All done in the lab. And I think fairly soon, you will see patients being treated with their own fat-derived, or adipose-derived, stem cells.I talked before about the use of devices to dramatically change the way we treat disease. Here's just one example before I close up. This is equally tragic. We have a very abiding and heartbreaking partnership with our colleagues at the Institute for Surgical Research in the US Army, who have to treat the now 11,000 kids that have come back from Iraq. Many of those patients are very severely burned.And if there's anything that's been learned about burn, it's that we don't know how to treat it. Everything that is done to treat burn \u2014 basically we do a sodding approach. We make something over here, and then we transplant it onto the site of the wound, and we try and get the two to take. In this case here, a new, wearable bio-reactor has been designed \u2014 it should be tested clinically later this year at ISR \u2014 by Joerg Gerlach in Pittsburgh. And that bio-reactor will lay down in the wound bed. The gun that you see there sprays cells. That's going to spray cells over that area. The reactor will serve to fertilize the environment, deliver other things as well at the same time, and therefore we will seed that lawn, as opposed to try the sodding approach. It's a completely different way of doing it.So my 18 minutes is up. So let me finish up with some good news, and maybe a little bit of bad news. The good news is that this is happening today. It's very powerful work. Clearly the images kind of get that across. It's incredibly difficult because it's highly inter-disciplinary. Almost every field of science engineering and clinical practice is involved in trying to get this to happen.A number of governments, and a number of regions, have recognized that this is a new way to treat disease. The Japanese government were perhaps the first, when they decided to invest first 3 billion, later another 2 billion in this field. It's no coincidence. Japan is the oldest country on earth in terms of its average age. They need this to work or their health system dies. So they're putting a lot of strategic investment focused in this area. The European Union, same thing. China, the same thing. China just launched a national tissue-engineering center. The first year budget was 250 million US dollars.In the United States we've had a somewhat different approach. (Laughter) Oh, for Al Gore to come and be in the real world as president. We've had a different approach. And the approach has basically been to just sort of fund things as they come along. But there's been no strategic investment to bring all of the necessary things to bear and focus them in a careful way.And I'm going to finish up with a quote, maybe a little cheap shot, at the director of the NIH, who's a very charming man. Myself and Jay Vacanti from Harvard went to visit with him and a number of his directors of his institute just a few months ago, to try and convince him that it was time to take just a little piece of that 27.5 billion dollars that he's going to get next year and focus it, in a strategic way, to make sure we can accelerate the pace at which these things get to patients. And at the end of a very testy meeting, what the NIH director said was, \"Your vision is larger than our appetite.\" I'd like to close by saying that no one's going to change our vision, but together we can change his appetite.

will regenerate lost function of the body\n\n00:02:09.958 --> 00:02:13.958\nby regenerating the function of organs and damaged tissue.\n\n00:02:13.958 --> 00:02:15.958\nSo that at the end of the treatment,\n\n00:02:15.958 --> 00:02:17.958\nyou are the same as you were at the beginning of the treatment.\n\n00:02:20.958 --> 00:02:23.958\nVery few good ideas -- if you agree that this is a good idea --\n\n00:02:23.958 --> 00:02:26.958\nvery few good ideas are truly novel.\n\n00:02:26.958 --> 00:02:28.958\nAnd this is just the same.\n\n00:02:28.958 --> 00:02:30.958\nIf you look back in history,\n\n00:02:30.958 --> 00:02:34.958\nCharles Lindbergh, who was better known for flying airplanes,\n\n00:02:34.958 --> 00:02:35.958\nwas actually one of the first people\n\n00:02:35.958 --> 00:02:39.958\nalong with Alexis Carrel, one of the Nobel Laureates from Rockefeller,\n\n00:02:39.958 --> 00:02:43.958\nto begin to think about, could you culture organs?\n\n00:02:43.958 --> 00:02:45.958\nAnd they published this book in 1937,\n\n00:02:45.958 --> 00:02:47.958\nwhere they actually began to think about,\n\n00:02:47.958 --> 00:02:52.958\nwhat could you do in bio-reactors to grow whole organs?\n\n00:02:53.958 --> 00:02:54.958\nWe've come a long way since then.\n\n00:02:54.958 --> 00:02:57.958\nI'm going to share with you some of the exciting work that's going on.\n\n00:02:57.958 --> 00:02:59.958\nBut before doing that, what I'd like to do\n\n00:02:59.958 --> 00:03:02.958\nis share my depression about the health care system\n\n00:03:02.958 --> 00:03:04.958\nand the need for this with you.\n\n00:03:04.958 --> 00:03:06.958\nMany of the talks yesterday talked about\n\n00:03:06.958 --> 00:03:09.958\nimproving the quality of life, and reducing poverty,\n\n00:03:09.958 --> 00:03:14.958\nand essentially increasing life expectancy all around the globe.\n\n00:03:14.958 --> 00:03:19.958\nOne of the challenges is that the richer we are, the longer we live.\n\n00:03:19.958 --> 00:03:22.958\nAnd the longer we live, the more expensive it is\n\n00:03:22.958 --> 00:03:25.958\nto take care of our diseases as we get older.\n\n00:03:25.958 --> 00:03:28.958\nThis is simply the wealth of a country\n\n00:03:28.958 --> 00:03:32.958\nversus the percent of population over the age of 65.\n\n00:03:32.958 --> 00:03:35.958\nAnd you can basically see that the richer a country is,\n\n00:03:35.958 --> 00:03:37.958\nthe older the people are within it.\n\n00:03:37.958 --> 00:03:39.958\nWhy is this important?\n\n00:03:39.958 --> 00:03:42.958\nAnd why is this a particularly dramatic challenge right now?\n\n00:03:43.958 --> 00:03:45.958\nIf the average age of your population is 30,\n\n00:03:45.958 --> 00:03:49.958\nthen the average kind of disease that you have to treat\n\n00:03:49.958 --> 00:03:51.958\nis maybe a broken ankle every now and again,\n\n00:03:51.958 --> 00:03:52.958\nmaybe a little bit of asthma.\n\n00:03:52.958 --> 00:03:56.958\nIf the average age in your country is 45 to 55,\n\n00:03:56.958 --> 00:03:59.958\nnow the average person is looking at diabetes,\n\n00:03:59.958 --> 00:04:02.958\nearly-onset diabetes, heart failure, coronary artery disease --\n\n00:04:02.958 --> 00:04:05.958\nthings that are inherently more difficult to treat,\n\n00:04:05.958 --> 00:04:07.958\nand much more expensive to treat.\n\n00:04:07.958 --> 00:04:10.958\nJust have a look at the demographics in the U.S. here.\n\n00:04:10.958 --> 00:04:12.958\nThis is from \"The Untied States of America.\"\n\n00:04:12.958 --> 00:04:16.958\nIn 1930, there were 41 workers per retiree.\n\n00:04:16.958 --> 00:04:21.958\n41 people who were basically outside of being really sick,\n\n00:04:21.958 --> 00:04:27.958\npaying for the one retiree who was experiencing debilitating disease.\n\n00:04:27.958 --> 00:04:30.958\nIn 2010, two workers per retiree in the U.S.\n\n00:04:30.958 --> 00:04:35.958\nAnd this is matched in every industrialized, wealthy country in the world.\n\n00:04:36.958 --> 00:04:39.958\nHow can you actually afford to treat patients\n\n00:04:39.958 --> 00:04:42.958\nwhen the reality of getting old looks like this?\n\n00:04:42.958 --> 00:04:45.958\nThis is age versus cost of health care.\n\n00:04:45.958 --> 00:04:51.958\nAnd you can see that right around age 45, 40 to 45,\n\n00:04:51.958 --> 00:04:55.958\nthere's a sudden spike in the cost of health care.\n\n00:04:56.958 --> 00:04:59.958\nIt's actually quite interesting. If you do the right studies,\n\n00:04:59.958 --> 00:05:03.958\nyou can look at how much you as an individual spend on your own health care,\n\n00:05:03.958 --> 00:05:05.958\nplotted over your lifetime.\n\n00:05:05.958 --> 00:05:08.958\nAnd about seven years before you're about to die, there's a spike.\n\n00:05:09.958 --> 00:05:10.958\nAnd you can actually --\n\n00:05:10.958 --> 00:05:12.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:05:12.958 --> 00:05:13.958\n-- we won't get into that.\n\n00:05:13.958 --> 00:05:17.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:05:17.958 --> 00:05:22.958\nThere are very few things, very few things that you can really do\n\n00:05:22.958 --> 00:05:27.958\nthat will change the way that you can treat these kinds of diseases\n\n00:05:27.958 --> 00:05:31.958\nand experience what I would call healthy aging.\n\n00:05:31.958 --> 00:05:33.958\nI'd suggest there are four things,\n\n00:05:33.958 --> 00:05:37.958\nand none of these things include an insurance system or a legal system.\n\n00:05:37.958 --> 00:05:39.958\nAll those things do is change who pays.\n\n00:05:39.958 --> 00:05:42.958\nThey don't actually change what the actual cost of the treatment is.\n\n00:05:43.958 --> 00:05:46.958\nOne thing you can do is not treat. You can ration health care.\n\n00:05:47.958 --> 00:05:49.958\nWe won't talk about that anymore. It's too depressing.\n\n00:05:50.958 --> 00:05:51.958\nYou can prevent.\n\n00:05:51.958 --> 00:05:54.958\nObviously a lot of monies should be put into prevention.\n\n00:05:55.958 --> 00:05:58.958\nBut perhaps most interesting, to me anyway, and most important,\n\n00:05:58.958 --> 00:06:03.958\nis the idea of diagnosing a disease much earlier on in the progression,\n\n00:06:03.958 --> 00:06:06.958\nand then treating the disease to cure the disease\n\n00:06:06.958 --> 00:06:08.958\ninstead of treating a symptom.\n\n00:06:08.958 --> 00:06:11.958\nThink of it in terms of diabetes, for instance.\n\n00:06:12.958 --> 00:06:14.958\nToday, with diabetes, what do we do?\n\n00:06:14.958 --> 00:06:17.958\nWe diagnose the disease eventually, once it becomes symptomatic,\n\n00:06:17.958 --> 00:06:21.958\nand then we treat the symptom for 10, 20, 30, 40 years.\n\n00:06:21.958 --> 00:06:25.958\nAnd we do OK. Insulin's a pretty good therapy.\n\n00:06:25.958 --> 00:06:26.958\nBut eventually it stops working,\n\n00:06:26.958 --> 00:06:33.958\nand diabetes leads to a predictable onset of debilitating disease.\n\n00:06:34.958 --> 00:06:37.958\nWhy couldn't we just inject the pancreas with something\n\n00:06:37.958 --> 00:06:40.958\nto regenerate the pancreas early on in the disease,\n\n00:06:40.958 --> 00:06:42.958\nperhaps even before it was symptomatic?\n\n00:06:43.958 --> 00:06:46.958\nAnd it might be a little bit expensive at the time that we did it,\n\n00:06:46.958 --> 00:06:49.958\nbut if it worked, we would truly be able to do something different.\n\n00:06:50.958 --> 00:06:55.958\nThis video, I think, gets across the concept that I'm talking about quite dramatically.\n\n00:06:55.958 --> 00:06:58.958\nThis is a newt re-growing its limb.\n\n00:06:59.958 --> 00:07:02.958\nIf a newt can do this kind of thing, why can't we?\n\n00:07:02.958 --> 00:07:05.958\nI'll actually show you some more important features\n\n00:07:05.958 --> 00:07:07.958\nabout limb regeneration in a moment.\n\n00:07:07.958 --> 00:07:10.958\nBut what we're talking about in regenerative medicine\n\n00:07:10.958 --> 00:07:13.958\nis doing this in every organ system of the body,\n\n00:07:13.958 --> 00:07:17.958\nfor tissues and for organs themselves.\n\n00:07:20.958 --> 00:07:23.958\nSo today's reality is that if we get sick,\n\n00:07:23.958 --> 00:07:26.958\nthe message is we will treat your symptoms,\n\n00:07:26.958 --> 00:07:28.958\nand you need to adjust to a new way of life.\n\n00:07:29.958 --> 00:07:31.958\nI would pose to you that tomorrow --\n\n00:07:31.958 --> 00:07:33.958\nand when tomorrow is we could debate,\n\n00:07:33.958 --> 00:07:35.958\nbut it's within the foreseeable future --\n\n00:07:35.958 --> 00:07:38.958\nwe will talk about regenerative rehabilitation.\n\n00:07:39.958 --> 00:07:40.958\nThere's a limb prosthetic up here,\n\n00:07:40.958 --> 00:07:43.958\nsimilar actually one on the soldier\n\n00:07:43.958 --> 00:07:45.958\nthat's come back from Iraq.\n\n00:07:45.958 --> 00:07:49.958\nThere are 370 soldiers that have come back from Iraq that have lost limbs.\n\n00:07:49.958 --> 00:07:52.958\nImagine if instead of facing that, they could actually\n\n00:07:52.958 --> 00:07:54.958\nface the regeneration of that limb.\n\n00:07:54.958 --> 00:07:55.958\nIt's a wild concept.\n\n00:07:56.958 --> 00:08:00.958\nI'll show you where we are at the moment in working towards that concept.\n\n00:08:01.958 --> 00:08:03.958\nBut it's applicable, again, to every organ system.\n\n00:08:03.958 --> 00:08:04.958\nHow can we do that?\n\n00:08:04.958 --> 00:08:08.958\nThe way to do that is to develop a conversation with the body.\n\n00:08:08.958 --> 00:08:10.958\nWe need to learn to speak the body's language.\n\n00:08:11.958 --> 00:08:16.958\nAnd to switch on processes that we knew how to do when we were a fetus.\n\n00:08:16.958 --> 00:08:21.958\nA mammalian fetus, if it loses a limb during the first trimester of pregnancy,\n\n00:08:21.958 --> 00:08:23.958\nwill re-grow that limb.\n\n00:08:23.958 --> 00:08:29.958\nSo our DNA has the capacity to do these kinds of wound-healing mechanisms.\n\n00:08:29.958 --> 00:08:31.958\nIt's a natural process,\n\n00:08:31.958 --> 00:08:34.958\nbut it is lost as we age.\n\n00:08:35.958 --> 00:08:38.958\nIn a child, before the age of about six months,\n\n00:08:38.958 --> 00:08:40.958\nif they lose their fingertip in an accident,\n\n00:08:40.958 --> 00:08:42.958\nthey'll re-grow their fingertip.\n\n00:08:42.958 --> 00:08:44.958\nBy the time they're five, they won't be able to do that anymore.\n\n00:08:45.958 --> 00:08:48.958\nSo to engage in that conversation with the body,\n\n00:08:48.958 --> 00:08:50.958\nwe need to speak the body's language.\n\n00:08:50.958 --> 00:08:54.958\nAnd there are certain tools in our toolbox that allow us to do this today.\n\n00:08:55.958 --> 00:08:58.958\nI'm going to give you an example of three of these tools\n\n00:08:58.958 --> 00:09:00.958\nthrough which to converse with the body.\n\n00:09:01.958 --> 00:09:03.958\nThe first is cellular therapies.\n\n00:09:03.958 --> 00:09:06.958\nClearly, we heal ourselves in a natural process,\n\n00:09:06.958 --> 00:09:09.958\nusing cells to do most of the work.\n\n00:09:09.958 --> 00:09:11.958\nTherefore, if we can find the right cells\n\n00:09:11.958 --> 00:09:14.958\nand implant them in the body, they may do the healing.\n\n00:09:15.958 --> 00:09:17.958\nSecondly, we can use materials.\n\n00:09:17.958 --> 00:09:20.958\nWe heard yesterday about the importance of new materials.\n\n00:09:20.958 --> 00:09:23.958\nIf we can invent materials, design materials,\n\n00:09:23.958 --> 00:09:26.958\nor extract materials from a natural environment,\n\n00:09:26.958 --> 00:09:30.958\nthen we might be able to have those materials induce the body to heal itself.\n\n00:09:30.958 --> 00:09:33.958\nAnd finally, we may be able to use smart devices\n\n00:09:33.958 --> 00:09:37.958\nthat will offload the work of the body and allow it to heal.\n\n00:09:38.958 --> 00:09:40.958\nI'm going to show you an example of each of these,\n\n00:09:40.958 --> 00:09:42.958\nand I'm going to start with materials.\n\n00:09:42.958 --> 00:09:44.958\nSteve Badylak -- who's at the University of Pittsburgh --\n\n00:09:44.958 --> 00:09:47.958\nabout a decade ago had a remarkable idea.\n\n00:09:47.958 --> 00:09:51.958\nAnd that idea was that the small intestine of a pig,\n\n00:09:51.958 --> 00:09:53.958\nif you threw away all the cells,\n\n00:09:54.958 --> 00:09:58.958\nand if you did that in a way that allowed it to remain biologically active,\n\n00:09:58.958 --> 00:10:01.958\nmay contain all of the necessary factors and signals\n\n00:10:01.958 --> 00:10:03.958\nthat would signal the body to heal itself.\n\n00:10:03.958 --> 00:10:05.958\nAnd he asked a very important question.\n\n00:10:05.958 --> 00:10:06.958\nHe asked the question,\n\n00:10:06.958 --> 00:10:09.958\nif I take that material, which is a natural material\n\n00:10:09.958 --> 00:10:12.958\nthat usually induces healing in the small intestine,\n\n00:10:12.958 --> 00:10:16.958\nand I place it somewhere else on a person's body,\n\n00:10:16.958 --> 00:10:19.958\nwould it give a tissue-specific response,\n\n00:10:19.958 --> 00:10:22.958\nor would it make small intestine if I tried to make a new ear?\n\n00:10:23.958 --> 00:10:28.958\nI wouldn't be telling you this story if it weren't compelling.\n\n00:10:28.958 --> 00:10:30.958\nThe picture I'm about to show you\n\n00:10:30.958 --> 00:10:32.958\nis a compelling picture.\n\n00:10:32.958 --> 00:10:34.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:10:34.958 --> 00:10:37.958\nHowever, for those of you that are even the slightest bit squeamish --\n\n00:10:37.958 --> 00:10:40.958\neven though you may not like to admit it in front of your friends --\n\n00:10:40.958 --> 00:10:43.958\nthe lights are down. This is a good time to look at your feet,\n\n00:10:43.958 --> 00:10:47.958\ncheck your Blackberry, do anything other than look at the screen.\n\n00:10:48.958 --> 00:10:51.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:10:51.958 --> 00:10:55.958\nWhat I'm about to show you is a diabetic ulcer.\n\n00:10:55.958 --> 00:10:58.958\nAnd although -- it's good to laugh before we look at this.\n\n00:10:58.958 --> 00:11:00.958\nThis is the reality of diabetes.\n\n00:11:00.958 --> 00:11:03.958\nI think a lot of times we hear about diabetics, diabetic ulcers,\n\n00:11:03.958 --> 00:11:08.958\nwe just don't connect the ulcer with the eventual treatment,\n\n00:11:08.958 --> 00:11:10.958\nwhich is amputation, if you can't heal it.\n\n00:11:10.958 --> 00:11:13.958\nSo I'm going to put the slide up now. It won't be up for long.\n\n00:11:13.958 --> 00:11:16.958\nThis is a diabetic ulcer. It's tragic.\n\n00:11:16.958 --> 00:11:18.958\nThe treatment for this is amputation.\n\n00:11:18.958 --> 00:11:22.958\nThis is an older lady. She has cancer of the liver as well as diabetes,\n\n00:11:22.958 --> 00:11:26.958\nand has decided to die with what' s left of her body intact.\n\n00:11:27.958 --> 00:11:32.958\nAnd this lady decided, after a year of attempted treatment of that ulcer,\n\n00:11:32.958 --> 00:11:35.958\nthat she would try this new therapy that Steve invented.\n\n00:11:35.958 --> 00:11:38.958\nThat's what the wound looked like 11 weeks later.\n\n00:11:38.958 --> 00:11:41.958\nThat material contained only natural signals.\n\n00:11:42.958 --> 00:11:46.958\nAnd that material induced the body to switch back on a healing response\n\n00:11:46.958 --> 00:11:48.958\nthat it didn't have before.\n\n00:11:48.958 --> 00:11:51.958\nThere's going to be a couple more distressing slides for those of you --\n\n00:11:51.958 --> 00:11:53.958\nI'll let you know when you can look again.\n\n00:11:53.958 --> 00:11:56.958\nThis is a horse. The horse is not in pain.\n\n00:11:56.958 --> 00:11:58.958\nIf the horse was in pain, I wouldn't show you this slide.\n\n00:11:58.958 --> 00:12:01.958\nThe horse just has another nostril that's developed\n\n00:12:01.958 --> 00:12:03.958\nbecause of a riding accident.\n\n00:12:03.958 --> 00:12:04.958\nJust a few weeks after treatment --\n\n00:12:04.958 --> 00:12:07.958\nin this case, taking that material, turning it into a gel,\n\n00:12:07.958 --> 00:12:11.958\nand packing that area, and then repeating the treatment a few times --\n\n00:12:11.958 --> 00:12:13.958\nand the horse heals up.\n\n00:12:13.958 --> 00:12:15.958\nAnd if you took an ultrasound of that area, it would look great.\n\n00:12:15.958 --> 00:12:18.958\nHere's a dolphin where the fin's been re-attached.\n\n00:12:18.958 --> 00:12:21.958\nThere are now 400,000 patients around the world\n\n00:12:21.958 --> 00:12:24.958\nwho have used that material to heal their wounds.\n\n00:12:24.958 --> 00:12:26.958\nCould you regenerate a limb?\n\n00:12:27.958 --> 00:12:31.958\nDARPA just gave Steve 15 million dollars to lead an eight-institution project\n\n00:12:31.958 --> 00:12:34.958\nto begin the process of asking that question.\n\n00:12:34.958 --> 00:12:36.958\nAnd I'll show you the 15 million dollar picture.\n\n00:12:37.958 --> 00:12:40.958\nThis is a 78 year-old man who's lost the end of his fingertip.\n\n00:12:40.958 --> 00:12:44.958\nRemember that I mentioned before the children who lose their fingertips.\n\n00:12:44.958 --> 00:12:46.958\nAfter treatment that's what it looks like.\n\n00:12:47.958 --> 00:12:49.958\nThis is happening today.\n\n00:12:49.958 --> 00:12:52.958\nThis is clinically relevant today.\n\n00:12:52.958 --> 00:12:55.958\nThere are materials that do this. Here are the heart patches.\n\n00:12:55.958 --> 00:12:57.958\nBut could you go a little further?\n\n00:12:57.958 --> 00:12:59.958\nCould you, say, instead of using material,\n\n00:12:59.958 --> 00:13:01.958\ncan I take some cells along with the material,\n\n00:13:01.958 --> 00:13:03.958\nand remove a damaged piece of tissue,\n\n00:13:03.958 --> 00:13:06.958\nput a bio-degradable material on there?\n\n00:13:06.958 --> 00:13:09.958\nYou can see here a little bit of heart muscle beating in a dish.\n\n00:13:09.958 --> 00:13:14.958\nThis was done by Teruo Okano at Tokyo Women's Hospital.\n\n00:13:14.958 --> 00:13:16.958\nHe can actually grow beating tissue in a dish.\n\n00:13:17.958 --> 00:13:19.958\nHe chills the dish, it changes its properties\n\n00:13:19.958 --> 00:13:21.958\nand he peels it right out of the dish.\n\n00:13:21.958 --> 00:13:22.958\nIt's the coolest stuff.\n\n00:13:24.958 --> 00:13:26.958\nNow I'm going to show you cell-based regeneration.\n\n00:13:26.958 --> 00:13:28.958\nAnd what I'm going to show you here\n\n00:13:28.958 --> 00:13:31.958\nis stem cells being removed from the hip of a patient.\n\n00:13:32.958 --> 00:13:34.958\nAgain, if you're squeamish, you don't want to watch.\n\n00:13:34.958 --> 00:13:35.958\nBut this one's kind of cool.\n\n00:13:35.958 --> 00:13:41.958\nSo this is a bypass operation, just like what Al Gore had,\n\n00:13:41.958 --> 00:13:42.958\nwith a difference.\n\n00:13:42.958 --> 00:13:45.958\nIn this case, at the end of the bypass operation,\n\n00:13:45.958 --> 00:13:47.958\nyou're going to see the stem cells from the patient\n\n00:13:47.958 --> 00:13:49.958\nthat were removed at the beginning of the procedure\n\n00:13:49.958 --> 00:13:52.958\nbeing injected directly into the heart of the patient.\n\n00:13:53.958 --> 00:13:55.958\nAnd I'm standing up here because at one point\n\n00:13:55.958 --> 00:13:58.958\nI'm going to show you just how early this technology is.\n\n00:13:58.958 --> 00:14:01.958\nHere go the stem cells, right into the beating heart of the patient.\n\n00:14:01.958 --> 00:14:02.958\nAnd if you look really carefully,\n\n00:14:02.958 --> 00:14:04.958\nit's going to be right around this point\n\n00:14:04.958 --> 00:14:06.958\nyou'll actually see a back-flush.\n\n00:14:06.958 --> 00:14:08.958\nYou see the cells coming back out.\n\n00:14:10.958 --> 00:14:12.958\nWe need all sorts of new technology, new devices,\n\n00:14:12.958 --> 00:14:15.958\nto get the cells to the right place at the right time.\n\n00:14:17.958 --> 00:14:19.958\nJust a little bit of data, a tiny bit of data.\n\n00:14:19.958 --> 00:14:21.958\nThis was a randomized trial.\n\n00:14:21.958 --> 00:14:24.958\nAt this time this was an N of 20. Now there's an N of about 100.\n\n00:14:25.958 --> 00:14:27.958\nBasically, if you take an extremely sick patient\n\n00:14:27.958 --> 00:14:29.958\nand you give them a bypass, they get a little bit better.\n\n00:14:29.958 --> 00:14:32.958\nIf you give them stem cells as well as their bypass,\n\n00:14:32.958 --> 00:14:35.958\nfor these particular patients, they became asymptomatic.\n\n00:14:35.958 --> 00:14:37.958\nThese are now two years out.\n\n00:14:39.958 --> 00:14:42.958\nThe coolest thing would be is if you could diagnose the disease early,\n\n00:14:42.958 --> 00:14:46.958\nand prevent the onset of the disease to a bad state.\n\n00:14:46.958 --> 00:14:50.958\nThis is the same procedure, but now done minimally invasively,\n\n00:14:50.958 --> 00:14:53.958\nwith only three holes in the body where they're taking the heart\n\n00:14:53.958 --> 00:14:57.958\nand simply injecting stem cells through a laparoscopic procedure.\n\n00:14:57.958 --> 00:14:58.958\nThere go the cells.\n\n00:14:58.958 --> 00:15:01.958\nWe don't have time to go into all of those details,\n\n00:15:01.958 --> 00:15:03.958\nbut basically, that works too.\n\n00:15:03.958 --> 00:15:06.958\nYou can take patients who are less sick,\n\n00:15:06.958 --> 00:15:10.958\nand bring them back to an almost asymptomatic state\n\n00:15:10.958 --> 00:15:12.958\nthrough that kind of therapy.\n\n00:15:12.958 --> 00:15:16.958\nHere's another example of stem-cell therapy that isn't quite clinical yet,\n\n00:15:16.958 --> 00:15:18.958\nbut I think very soon will be.\n\n00:15:18.958 --> 00:15:20.958\nThis is the work of Kacey Marra from Pittsburgh,\n\n00:15:20.958 --> 00:15:22.958\nalong with a number of colleagues around the world.\n\n00:15:22.958 --> 00:15:25.958\nThey've decided that liposuction fluid,\n\n00:15:25.958 --> 00:15:28.958\nwhich -- in the United States, we have a lot of liposuction fluid.\n\n00:15:28.958 --> 00:15:29.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:15:29.958 --> 00:15:31.958\nIt's a great source of stem cells.\n\n00:15:31.958 --> 00:15:34.958\nStem cells are packed in that liposuction fluid.\n\n00:15:34.958 --> 00:15:37.958\nSo you could go in, you could get your tummy-tuck.\n\n00:15:37.958 --> 00:15:39.958\nOut comes the liposuction fluid,\n\n00:15:39.958 --> 00:15:43.958\nand in this case, the stem cells are isolated and turned into neurons.\n\n00:15:44.958 --> 00:15:45.958\nAll done in the lab.\n\n00:15:45.958 --> 00:15:48.958\nAnd I think fairly soon, you will see patients being treated\n\n00:15:48.958 --> 00:15:52.958\nwith their own fat-derived, or adipose-derived, stem cells.\n\n00:15:53.958 --> 00:15:55.958\nI talked before about the use of devices\n\n00:15:55.958 --> 00:15:58.958\nto dramatically change the way we treat disease.\n\n00:15:58.958 --> 00:16:00.958\nHere's just one example before I close up.\n\n00:16:00.958 --> 00:16:02.958\nThis is equally tragic.\n\n00:16:02.958 --> 00:16:05.958\nWe have a very abiding and heartbreaking partnership\n\n00:16:05.958 --> 00:16:09.958\nwith our colleagues at the Institute for Surgical Research in the US Army,\n\n00:16:09.958 --> 00:16:14.958\nwho have to treat the now 11,000 kids that have come back from Iraq.\n\n00:16:14.958 --> 00:16:16.958\nMany of those patients are very severely burned.\n\n00:16:16.958 --> 00:16:18.958\nAnd if there's anything that's been learned about burn,\n\n00:16:18.958 --> 00:16:20.958\nit's that we don't know how to treat it.\n\n00:16:20.958 --> 00:16:22.958\nEverything that is done to treat burn --\n\n00:16:22.958 --> 00:16:24.958\nbasically we do a sodding approach.\n\n00:16:25.958 --> 00:16:27.958\nWe make something over here,\n\n00:16:27.958 --> 00:16:29.958\nand then we transplant it onto the site of the wound,\n\n00:16:29.958 --> 00:16:31.958\nand we try and get the two to take.\n\n00:16:31.958 --> 00:16:35.958\nIn this case here, a new, wearable bio-reactor has been designed --\n\n00:16:35.958 --> 00:16:38.958\nit should be tested clinically later this year at ISR --\n\n00:16:38.958 --> 00:16:40.958\nby Joerg Gerlach in Pittsburgh.\n\n00:16:40.958 --> 00:16:43.958\nAnd that bio-reactor will lay down in the wound bed.\n\n00:16:43.958 --> 00:16:46.958\nThe gun that you see there sprays cells.\n\n00:16:46.958 --> 00:16:49.958\nThat's going to spray cells over that area.\n\n00:16:49.958 --> 00:16:52.958\nThe reactor will serve to fertilize the environment,\n\n00:16:52.958 --> 00:16:55.958\ndeliver other things as well at the same time,\n\n00:16:55.958 --> 00:16:58.958\nand therefore we will seed that lawn,\n\n00:16:58.958 --> 00:17:00.958\nas opposed to try the sodding approach.\n\n00:17:00.958 --> 00:17:02.958\nIt's a completely different way of doing it.\n\n00:17:04.958 --> 00:17:06.958\nSo my 18 minutes is up.\n\n00:17:06.958 --> 00:17:08.958\nSo let me finish up with some good news,\n\n00:17:08.958 --> 00:17:10.958\nand maybe a little bit of bad news.\n\n00:17:11.958 --> 00:17:14.958\nThe good news is that this is happening today.\n\n00:17:14.958 --> 00:17:16.958\nIt's very powerful work.\n\n00:17:16.958 --> 00:17:18.958\nClearly the images kind of get that across.\n\n00:17:18.958 --> 00:17:21.958\nIt's incredibly difficult because it's highly inter-disciplinary.\n\n00:17:21.958 --> 00:17:25.958\nAlmost every field of science engineering and clinical practice\n\n00:17:25.958 --> 00:17:28.958\nis involved in trying to get this to happen.\n\n00:17:29.958 --> 00:17:31.958\nA number of governments, and a number of regions,\n\n00:17:31.958 --> 00:17:34.958\nhave recognized that this is a new way to treat disease.\n\n00:17:34.958 --> 00:17:36.958\nThe Japanese government were perhaps the first,\n\n00:17:36.958 --> 00:17:39.958\nwhen they decided to invest first 3 billion,\n\n00:17:39.958 --> 00:17:42.958\nlater another 2 billion in this field.\n\n00:17:42.958 --> 00:17:43.958\nIt's no coincidence.\n\n00:17:43.958 --> 00:17:46.958\nJapan is the oldest country on earth in terms of its average age.\n\n00:17:46.958 --> 00:17:50.958\nThey need this to work or their health system dies.\n\n00:17:51.958 --> 00:17:54.958\nSo they're putting a lot of strategic investment focused in this area.\n\n00:17:55.958 --> 00:17:57.958\nThe European Union, same thing.\n\n00:17:57.958 --> 00:17:59.958\nChina, the same thing.\n\n00:17:59.958 --> 00:18:01.958\nChina just launched a national tissue-engineering center.\n\n00:18:01.958 --> 00:18:05.958\nThe first year budget was 250 million US dollars.\n\n00:18:05.958 --> 00:18:09.958\nIn the United States we've had a somewhat different approach.\n\n00:18:09.958 --> 00:18:12.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:18:12.958 --> 00:18:16.958\nOh, for Al Gore to come and be in the real world as president.\n\n00:18:16.958 --> 00:18:17.958\nWe've had a different approach.\n\n00:18:17.958 --> 00:18:21.958\nAnd the approach has basically been to just sort of fund things as they come along.\n\n00:18:21.958 --> 00:18:24.958\nBut there's been no strategic investment\n\n00:18:24.958 --> 00:18:30.958\nto bring all of the necessary things to bear and focus them in a careful way.\n\n00:18:30.958 --> 00:18:33.958\nAnd I'm going to finish up with a quote, maybe a little cheap shot,\n\n00:18:33.958 --> 00:18:37.958\nat the director of the NIH, who's a very charming man.\n\n00:18:39.958 --> 00:18:41.958\nMyself and Jay Vacanti from Harvard\n\n00:18:41.958 --> 00:18:46.958\nwent to visit with him and a number of his directors of his institute\n\n00:18:46.958 --> 00:18:48.958\njust a few months ago,\n\n00:18:49.958 --> 00:18:54.958\nto try and convince him that it was time to take just a little piece\n\n00:18:54.958 --> 00:18:58.958\nof that 27.5 billion dollars that he's going to get next year\n\n00:18:58.958 --> 00:19:03.958\nand focus it, in a strategic way, to make sure we can accelerate the pace\n\n00:19:03.958 --> 00:19:05.958\nat which these things get to patients.\n\n00:19:06.958 --> 00:19:08.958\nAnd at the end of a very testy meeting,\n\n00:19:08.958 --> 00:19:10.958\nwhat the NIH director said was,\n\n00:19:10.958 --> 00:19:12.958\n\"Your vision is larger than our appetite.\"\n\n00:19:12.958 --> 00:19:16.958\nI'd like to close by saying that no one's going to change our vision,\n\n00:19:16.958 --> 00:19:18.958\nbut together we can change his appetite.\n\n00:19:18.958 --> 00:19:19.958\nThank you."}, {"title": "The Web's secret stories", "duration": "1030", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/jonathan_harris_tells_the_web_s_secret_stories", "transcript": "So I really consider myself a storyteller. But I don't really tell stories in the usual way, in the sense that I don't usually tell my own stories. Instead, I'm really interested in building tools that allow large numbers of other people to tell their stories, people all around the world. I do this because I think that people actually have a lot in common. I think people are very similar, but I also think that we have trouble seeing that.You know, as I look around the world I see a lot of gaps, and I think we all see a lot of gaps. And we define ourselves by our gaps. There's language gaps, there's ethnicity and racial gaps, there's age gaps, there's gender gaps, there's sexuality gaps, there's wealth and money gaps, there's education gaps, there's also religious gaps. You know, we have all these gaps and I think we like our gaps because they make us feel like we identify with something, some smaller community. But I think that actually, despite our gaps, we really have a lot in common. And I think one thing we have in common is a very deep need to express ourselves. I think this is a very old human desire. It's nothing new.But the thing about self-expression is that there's traditionally been this imbalance between the desire that we have to express ourselves and the number of sympathetic friends who are willing to stand around and listen.(Laughter)This, also, is nothing new. Since the dawn of human history, we've tried to rectify this imbalance by making art, writing poems, singing songs, scripting editorials and sending them in to a newspaper, gossiping with friends. This is nothing new.What's new is that in the last several years a lot of these very traditional physical human activities, these acts of self-expression, have been moving onto the Internet. And as that's happened, people have been leaving behind footprints, footprints that tell stories of their moments of self-expression. And so what I do is, I write computer programs that study very large sets of these footprints, and then try to draw conclusions about the people who left them \u2014 what they feel, what they think, what's different in the world today than usual, these sorts of questions.One project that explores these ideas, which was made about a year ago, is a piece called We Feel Fine. This is a piece that every two or three minutes scans the world's newly-posted blog entries for occurrences of the phrases \"I feel\" or \"I am feeling.\" And when it finds one of those phrases, it grabs the sentence up to the period, and then automatically tries to deduce the age, gender and geographical location of the person that wrote that sentence. Then, knowing the geographical location and the time, we can also then figure out the weather when that person wrote the sentence. All of this information is saved in a database that collects about 20,000 feelings a day. It's been running for about a year and a half. It's reached about seven-and-a-half million human feelings now. And I'll show you a glimpse of how this information is then visualized. So this is We Feel Fine.What you see here is a madly swarming mass of particles, each of which represents a single human feeling that was stated in the last few hours. The color of each particle corresponds to the type of feeling inside \u2014 so that happy, positive feelings are brightly colored. And sad, negative feelings are darkly colored. The diameter of each dot represents the length of the sentence inside, so that the large dots contain large sentences, and the small dots contain small sentences. Any dot can be clicked and expanded. And we see here, \"I would just feel so much better if I could curl up in his arms right now and feel his affection for me in the embrace of his body and the tenderness of his lips.\" So it gets pretty hot and steamy sometimes in the world of human emotions. And all of these are stated by people: \"I know that objectively it really doesn't mean much, but after spending so many years as a small fish in a big pond, it's nice to feel bigger again.\"The dots exhibit human qualities. They kind of have their own physics, and they swarm wildly around, kind of exploring the world of life. And then they also exhibit curiosity. You can see a few of them are swarming around the cursor right now. You can see some other ones are swarming around the bottom left corner of the screen around six words. Those six words represent the six movements of We Feel Fine. We're currently seeing Madness. There's also Murmurs, Montage, Mobs, Metrics and Mounds. And I'll walk you through a few of those now. Murmurs causes all of the feelings to fly to the ceiling. And then, one by one, in reverse chronological order, they excuse themselves, entering the scrolling list of feelings. \"I feel a bit better now.\"(Laughter)\"I feel confused and unsure of what the hell I want to do.\" \"I feel gypped out of something awesome here.\" \"I feel so free; I feel so good.\" \"I feel like I'm in this fog of depression that I can't get out of.\" And you can click any of these to go out and visit the blog from which it was collected. And in that way, you can connect with the authors of these statements if you feel some degree of empathy.The next movement is called Montage. Montage causes all of the feelings that contain photographs to become extracted and display themselves in a grid. This grid is then said to represent the picture of the world's feelings in the last few hours, if you will. Each of these can be clicked and we can blow it up. We see, \"I just feel like I'm not going to have fun if it's not the both of us.\" That was from someone in Michigan. We see, \"I feel like I have been at a computer all day.\"(Laughter)These are automatically constructed using the found objects: \"I think I feel a little full.\"The next movement is called mobs. Mobs provides different statistical breakdowns of the population of the world's feelings in the last few hours. We see that \"better\" is the most frequent feeling right now, followed by \"good,\" \"bad,\" \"guilty,\" \"right,\" \"down,\" \"sick\" and so on. We can also get a gender breakdown. And we see that women are slightly more prolific talking about their emotions in the last few hours than men. We can do an age breakdown, which gives us a histogram of the world's emotional distribution by age. We see people in their twenties are the most prolific, followed by teenagers, and then people in their thirties, and it dies out very quickly from there. In weather, the feelings assume the physical characteristics of the weather that they represent, so that the ones collected on a sunny day swirl around as if they're part of the sun. The cloudy ones float along as if they're on a breeze. The rainy ones fall down as if they're in a rainstorm, and the snowy ones kind of flutter to the ground.Finally, location causes the feelings to move to their positions on a world map showing the geographical distribution of feelings. Metrics provides more numerical views on the data. We see that the world is feeling \"used\" at 3.3 times the normal level right now.(Laughter)They're feeling \"warm\" at 2.9 times the normal level, and so on. Other views are also available. Here are gender, age, weather, location.The final movement is called Mounds. It's a bit different from the others. Mounds visualizes the entire dataset as large, gelatinous blobs which kind of jiggle. And if I hold down my cursor, they do a little dance. We see \"better\" is the most frequent feeling, followed by \"bad.\" And then if I go over here, the list begins to scroll, and there are actually thousands of feelings that have been collected. You can see the little pink cursor moving along, representing our position. Here we see people that feel \"slipping,\" \"nauseous,\" \"responsible.\"There's also a search capability, if you're interested in finding out about a certain population. For instance, you could find women who feel \"addicted\" in their 20s when it was cloudy in Bangladesh.(Laughter)But I'll spare you that. So here are some of my favorite montages that have been collected: \"I feel so much of my dad alive in me that there isn't even room for me.\" \"I feel very lonely.\" \"I need to be in some backwoods redneck town so that I can feel beautiful.\" \"I feel invisible to you.\" \"I wouldn't hide it if society didn't make me feel like I needed to.\" \"I feel in love with Carolyn.\" \"I feel so naughty.\" \"I feel these weirdoes are actually an asset to college life.\"(Laughter)\"I love how I feel today.\"So as you can see, We Feel Fine uses a technique that I call \"passive observation.\" What I mean by that is that it passively observes people as they live their lives. It scans the world's blogs and looks at what people are writing, and these people don't know they're being watched or interviewed. And because of that, you end up getting very honest, candid, sincere responses that are often very moving. And this is a technique that I usually prefer in my work because people don't know they're being interviewed. They're just living life, and they end up just acting like that.Another technique is directly questioning people. And this is a technique that I explored in a different project, the Yahoo! Time Capsule, which was designed to take a fingerprint of the world in 2006. It was divided into ten very simple themes \u2014 love, anger, sadness and so on \u2014 each of which contained a single, very open-ended question put to the world: What do you love? What makes you angry? What makes you sad? What do you believe in? And so on. The time capsule was available for one month online, translated into 10 languages, and this is what it looked like. It's a spinning globe, the surface of which is entirely composed of the pictures and words and drawings of people that submitted to the time capsule. The ten themes radiate out and orbit the time capsule. You can sift through this data and see what people have submitted. This is in response to, What's beautiful? \"Miss World.\"There are two modes to the time capsule. There's One World, which presents the spinning globe, and Many Voices, which splits the data out into film strips and lets you sift through them one by one. So this project was punctuated by a really amazing event, which was held in the desert outside Albuquerque in New Mexico at the Jemez Pueblo, where for three consecutive nights, the contents of the capsule were projected onto the sides of the ancient Red Rock Canyon walls, which stand about 200 feet tall. It was really incredible. And we also projected the contents of the time capsule as binary code using a 35-watt laser into outer space. You can see the orange line leaving the desert floor at about a 45 degree angle there. This was amazing because the first night I looked at all this information and really started seeing the gaps that I talked about earlier \u2014 the differences in age, gender and wealth and so on.But, you know, as I looked at this more and more and more, and saw these images go across the rocks, I realized I was seeing the same archetypal events depicted again and again and again. You know: weddings, births, funerals, the first car, the first kiss, the first camel or horse \u2014 depending on the culture. And it was really moving. And this picture here was taken the final night from a distant cliff about two miles away, where the contents of the capsule were being beamed into space. And there was something very moving about all of this human expression being shot off into the night sky.And it started to make me think a lot about the night sky, and how humans have always used the night sky to project their great stories. You know, as a child in Vermont, on a farm where I grew up, I would often look up into the dark sky and see the three star belt of Orion, the Hunter. And as an adult, I've been more aware of the great Greek myths playing out in the sky overhead every night. You know, Orion facing the roaring bull. Perseus flying to the rescue of Andromeda. Zeus battling Chronos for control of Mount Olympus. I mean, these are the great tales of the Greeks.And it caused me to wonder about our world today. And it caused me to wonder specifically, if we could make new constellations today, what would those look like? What would those be? If we could make new pictures in the sky, what would we draw? What are the great stories of today?And those are the questions that inspired my new project, which is debuting here today at TED. Nobody's seen this yet, publicly. It's called Universe: Revealing Our Modern Mythology. And it uses this metaphor of an interactive night sky. So, it's my great pleasure now to show this to you.So, Universe will open here. And you'll see that it leads with a shifting star field, and there's an Aurora Borealis in the background, kind of morphing with color. The color of the Aurora Borealis can be controlled using this single bar of color at the bottom, and we'll put it down here to red. So you see this kind of \u2014 these stars moving along.Now, these aren't just little points of light, little pixels. Each of those stars actually represents a specific event in the real world \u2014 a quote that was stated by somebody, an image, a news story, a person, a company. You know, some kind of heroic personality. And you might notice that as the cursor begins to touch some of these stars, that shapes begin to emerge. We see here there's a little man walking along, or maybe a woman. And we see here a photograph with a head. You can start to see words emerging here. And those are the constellations of today. And I can turn them all on, and you can see them moving across the sky now.This is the universe of 2007, the last two months. The data from this is global news coverage from thousands of news sources around the world. It's using the API of a really great company that I work with in New York, actually, called Daylife. And it's kind of the zeitgeist view at this level of the world's current mythology over the last couple of months.So we can see where it's emerging here, like President Ford, Iraq, Bush. And we can actually isolate just the words \u2014 I call them secrets \u2014 and we can cause them to form an alphabetical list. And we see Anna Nicole Smith playing a big role recently. President Ford \u2014 this is Gerald Ford's funeral. We can actually click anything in Universe and have it become the center of the universe, and everything else will enter its orbit. So, we'll click Ford, and now that becomes the center. And the things that relate to Ford enter its orbit and swirl around it.We can isolate just the photographs, and we now see those. We can click on one of those and have the photograph be the center of the universe. Now the things that relate to it are swirling around. We can click on this and we see this iconic image of Betty Ford kissing her husband's coffin.In Universe, there's kind of no end. It just goes infinitely, and you can just kind of click on stuff. This is a photographic representation, called Snapshots. But we can actually be more specific in defining our universe. So, if we want to, let's check out what Bill Clinton's universe looks like. And let's see, in the past week, what he's been up to. So now, we have a new universe, which is just constrained to all things Bill Clinton. We can have his constellations emerge here. We can pull out his secrets, and we see that it has a lot to do with candidates, Hillary, presidential, Barack Obama. We can see the stories that Bill Clinton is taking part in right now. Any of those can be opened up. So we see Obama and the Clintons meet in Alabama. You can see that this is an important story; there are a lot of things in its orbit. If we open this up, we get different perspectives on this story. You can click any of those to go out and read the article at the source. This one's from Al Jazeera.We can also see the superstars. These would be the people that are kind of the looming heroes and heroines in the universe of Bill Clinton. So there's Bill Clinton, Hillary, Iraq, George Bush, Barack Obama, Scooter Libby \u2014 these are kind of the people of Bill Clinton. We can also see a world map, so this shows us the geographic reach of Bill Clinton in the last week or so. We can see he's been focused in America because he's been campaigning, probably, but a little bit of action over here in the Middle East. And then we can also see a timeline. So we see that he was a bit quiet on Saturday, but he was back to work on Sunday morning, and actually been tapering off since then this week.And it's not limited to just people or dates, but we can actually put in concepts also. So if I put in climate change for all of 2006, we'll see what that universe looks like. Here we have our star field. Here we have our shapes. Here we have our secrets. So we see again, climate change is large: Nairobi, global conference, environmental. And there are also quotes that you can see, if you're interested in reading about quotes on climate change. You know, this is really an infinite thing.The superstars of climate change in 2006: United States, Britain, China. You know, these are the towering countries that kind of define this concept. So this is a piece that demands exploration.This will be online in several days, probably next Tuesday. And you'll all be able to use it and kind of explore what your own personal mythology might be. You'll notice that in Daylife \u2014 rather, in Universe \u2014 it supports both the notion of a global mythology, which is represented by something as broad as, say, 2007, and also a personal mythology. As you search for the things that are important to you in your world, and then see what the constellations of those might look like.So it's been a pleasure. Thank you very much.(Applause)", "id": 144, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:11.958 --> 00:00:15.958\nSo I really consider myself a storyteller.\n\n00:00:15.958 --> 00:00:19.958\nBut I don't really tell stories in the usual way,\n\n00:00:19.958 --> 00:00:22.958\nin the sense that I don't usually tell my own stories.\n\n00:00:23.958 --> 00:00:25.958\nInstead, I'm really interested in building tools that allow\n\n00:00:25.958 --> 00:00:29.958\nlarge numbers of other people to tell their stories,\n\n00:00:29.958 --> 00:00:30.958\npeople all around the world.\n\n00:00:31.958 --> 00:00:35.958\nI do this because I think that people actually have a lot in common.\n\n00:00:35.958 --> 00:00:36.958\nI think people are very similar,\n\n00:00:37.958 --> 00:00:39.958\nbut I also think that we have trouble seeing that.\n\n00:00:40.958 --> 00:00:43.958\nYou know, as I look around the world I see a lot of gaps,\n\n00:00:43.958 --> 00:00:44.958\nand I think we all see a lot of gaps.\n\n00:00:45.958 --> 00:00:47.958\nAnd we define ourselves by our gaps.\n\n00:00:48.958 --> 00:00:49.958\nThere's language gaps,\n\n00:00:50.958 --> 00:00:54.958\nthere's ethnicity and racial gaps, there's age gaps,\n\n00:00:54.958 --> 00:00:59.958\nthere's gender gaps, there's sexuality gaps,\n\n00:00:59.958 --> 00:01:03.958\nthere's wealth and money gaps, there's education gaps,\n\n00:01:04.958 --> 00:01:06.958\nthere's also religious gaps.\n\n00:01:06.958 --> 00:01:08.958\nYou know, we have all these gaps and I think we like our gaps\n\n00:01:08.958 --> 00:01:11.958\nbecause they make us feel like we identify with something,\n\n00:01:11.958 --> 00:01:12.958\nsome smaller community.\n\n00:01:12.958 --> 00:01:14.958\nBut I think that actually, despite our gaps,\n\n00:01:15.958 --> 00:01:16.958\nwe really have a lot in common.\n\n00:01:16.958 --> 00:01:20.958\nAnd I think one thing we have in common is a very deep need\n\n00:01:21.958 --> 00:01:22.958\nto express ourselves.\n\n00:01:22.958 --> 00:01:27.958\nI think this is a very old human desire. It's nothing new.\n\n00:01:28.958 --> 00:01:29.958\nBut the thing about self-expression\n\n00:01:29.958 --> 00:01:31.958\nis that there's traditionally been this imbalance\n\n00:01:31.958 --> 00:01:34.958\nbetween the desire that we have to express ourselves\n\n00:01:34.958 --> 00:01:36.958\nand the number of sympathetic friends\n\n00:01:36.958 --> 00:01:38.958\nwho are willing to stand around and listen.\n\n00:01:38.958 --> 00:01:39.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:01:40.958 --> 00:01:42.958\nThis, also, is nothing new.\n\n00:01:42.958 --> 00:01:45.958\nSince the dawn of human history, we've tried to rectify this imbalance\n\n00:01:45.958 --> 00:01:49.958\nby making art, writing poems, singing songs,\n\n00:01:49.958 --> 00:01:52.958\nscripting editorials and sending them in to a newspaper,\n\n00:01:52.958 --> 00:01:54.958\ngossiping with friends. This is nothing new.\n\n00:01:54.958 --> 00:01:56.958\nWhat's new is that in the last several years\n\n00:01:56.958 --> 00:01:59.958\na lot of these very traditional physical human activities,\n\n00:01:59.958 --> 00:02:01.958\nthese acts of self-expression, have been moving onto the Internet.\n\n00:02:02.958 --> 00:02:05.958\nAnd as that's happened, people have been leaving behind footprints,\n\n00:02:06.958 --> 00:02:09.958\nfootprints that tell stories of their moments of self-expression.\n\n00:02:10.958 --> 00:02:13.958\nAnd so what I do is, I write computer programs\n\n00:02:13.958 --> 00:02:16.958\nthat study very large sets of these footprints,\n\n00:02:16.958 --> 00:02:19.958\nand then try to draw conclusions about the people who left them --\n\n00:02:20.958 --> 00:02:21.958\nwhat they feel, what they think,\n\n00:02:22.958 --> 00:02:24.958\nwhat's different in the world today than usual,\n\n00:02:25.958 --> 00:02:26.958\nthese sorts of questions.\n\n00:02:27.958 --> 00:02:28.958\nOne project that explores these ideas,\n\n00:02:29.958 --> 00:02:30.958\nwhich was made about a year ago,\n\n00:02:30.958 --> 00:02:31.958\nis a piece called We Feel Fine.\n\n00:02:31.958 --> 00:02:34.958\nThis is a piece that every two or three minutes\n\n00:02:34.958 --> 00:02:36.958\nscans the world's newly-posted blog entries\n\n00:02:36.958 --> 00:02:41.958\nfor occurrences of the phrases \"I feel\" or \"I am feeling.\"\n\n00:02:41.958 --> 00:02:42.958\nAnd when it finds one of those phrases,\n\n00:02:42.958 --> 00:02:44.958\nit grabs the sentence up to the period,\n\n00:02:44.958 --> 00:02:47.958\nand then automatically tries to deduce the age, gender\n\n00:02:47.958 --> 00:02:50.958\nand geographical location of the person that wrote that sentence.\n\n00:02:51.958 --> 00:02:53.958\nThen, knowing the geographical location and the time,\n\n00:02:53.958 --> 00:02:54.958\nwe can also then figure out the weather\n\n00:02:54.958 --> 00:02:56.958\nwhen that person wrote the sentence.\n\n00:02:57.958 --> 00:02:59.958\nAll of this information is saved in a database\n\n00:02:59.958 --> 00:03:01.958\nthat collects about 20,000 feelings a day.\n\n00:03:01.958 --> 00:03:03.958\nIt's been running for about a year and a half.\n\n00:03:03.958 --> 00:03:06.958\nIt's reached about seven-and-a-half million human feelings now.\n\n00:03:06.958 --> 00:03:07.958\nAnd I'll show you a glimpse\n\n00:03:07.958 --> 00:03:12.958\nof how this information is then visualized. So this is We Feel Fine.\n\n00:03:13.958 --> 00:03:17.958\nWhat you see here is a madly swarming mass of particles,\n\n00:03:17.958 --> 00:03:19.958\neach of which represents a single human feeling\n\n00:03:19.958 --> 00:03:21.958\nthat was stated in the last few hours.\n\n00:03:22.958 --> 00:03:25.958\nThe color of each particle corresponds to the type of feeling inside --\n\n00:03:25.958 --> 00:03:27.958\nso that happy, positive feelings are brightly colored.\n\n00:03:28.958 --> 00:03:30.958\nAnd sad, negative feelings are darkly colored.\n\n00:03:30.958 --> 00:03:32.958\nThe diameter of each dot\n\n00:03:32.958 --> 00:03:34.958\nrepresents the length of the sentence inside,\n\n00:03:34.958 --> 00:03:36.958\nso that the large dots contain large sentences,\n\n00:03:36.958 --> 00:03:38.958\nand the small dots contain small sentences.\n\n00:03:38.958 --> 00:03:41.958\nAny dot can be clicked and expanded. And we see here,\n\n00:03:42.958 --> 00:03:43.958\n\"I would just feel so much better\n\n00:03:43.958 --> 00:03:46.958\nif I could curl up in his arms right now and feel his affection for me\n\n00:03:46.958 --> 00:03:49.958\nin the embrace of his body and the tenderness of his lips.\"\n\n00:03:49.958 --> 00:03:51.958\nSo it gets pretty hot and steamy sometimes\n\n00:03:51.958 --> 00:03:53.958\nin the world of human emotions.\n\n00:03:53.958 --> 00:03:56.958\nAnd all of these are stated by people:\n\n00:03:56.958 --> 00:03:58.958\n\"I know that objectively it really doesn't mean much,\n\n00:03:58.958 --> 00:04:01.958\nbut after spending so many years as a small fish in a big pond,\n\n00:04:01.958 --> 00:04:03.958\nit's nice to feel bigger again.\"\n\n00:04:03.958 --> 00:04:06.958\nThe dots exhibit human qualities. They kind of have their own physics,\n\n00:04:06.958 --> 00:04:10.958\nand they swarm wildly around, kind of exploring the world of life.\n\n00:04:11.958 --> 00:04:12.958\nAnd then they also exhibit curiosity.\n\n00:04:12.958 --> 00:04:15.958\nYou can see a few of them are swarming around the cursor right now.\n\n00:04:15.958 --> 00:04:16.958\nYou can see some other ones\n\n00:04:17.958 --> 00:04:18.958\nare swarming around the bottom left corner of the screen\n\n00:04:19.958 --> 00:04:22.958\naround six words. Those six words represent the six movements\n\n00:04:22.958 --> 00:04:25.958\nof We Feel Fine. We're currently seeing Madness.\n\n00:04:25.958 --> 00:04:29.958\nThere's also Murmurs, Montage, Mobs, Metrics and Mounds.\n\n00:04:29.958 --> 00:04:31.958\nAnd I'll walk you through a few of those now.\n\n00:04:31.958 --> 00:04:34.958\nMurmurs causes all of the feelings to fly to the ceiling.\n\n00:04:35.958 --> 00:04:37.958\nAnd then, one by one, in reverse chronological order,\n\n00:04:37.958 --> 00:04:40.958\nthey excuse themselves, entering the scrolling list of feelings.\n\n00:04:42.958 --> 00:04:43.958\n\"I feel a bit better now.\"\n\n00:04:43.958 --> 00:04:45.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:04:46.958 --> 00:04:48.958\n\"I feel confused and unsure of what the hell I want to do.\"\n\n00:04:49.958 --> 00:04:51.958\n\"I feel gypped out of something awesome here.\"\n\n00:04:52.958 --> 00:04:53.958\n\"I feel so free; I feel so good.\"\n\n00:04:54.958 --> 00:04:57.958\n\"I feel like I'm in this fog of depression that I can't get out of.\"\n\n00:04:57.958 --> 00:04:59.958\nAnd you can click any of these to go out and visit the blog\n\n00:04:59.958 --> 00:05:01.958\nfrom which it was collected. And in that way,\n\n00:05:01.958 --> 00:05:03.958\nyou can connect with the authors of these statements\n\n00:05:04.958 --> 00:05:05.958\nif you feel some degree of empathy.\n\n00:05:06.958 --> 00:05:08.958\nThe next movement is called Montage.\n\n00:05:08.958 --> 00:05:11.958\nMontage causes all of the feelings that contain photographs\n\n00:05:11.958 --> 00:05:14.958\nto become extracted and display themselves in a grid.\n\n00:05:15.958 --> 00:05:19.958\nThis grid is then said to represent the picture of the world's feelings\n\n00:05:19.958 --> 00:05:20.958\nin the last few hours, if you will.\n\n00:05:20.958 --> 00:05:23.958\nEach of these can be clicked and we can blow it up.\n\n00:05:23.958 --> 00:05:26.958\nWe see, \"I just feel like I'm not going to have fun\n\n00:05:26.958 --> 00:05:30.958\nif it's not the both of us.\" That was from someone in Michigan.\n\n00:05:32.958 --> 00:05:36.958\nWe see, \"I feel like I have been at a computer all day.\"\n\n00:05:36.958 --> 00:05:37.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:05:39.958 --> 00:05:42.958\nThese are automatically constructed using the found objects:\n\n00:05:42.958 --> 00:05:44.958\n\"I think I feel a little full.\"\n\n00:05:46.958 --> 00:05:47.958\nThe next movement is called mobs.\n\n00:05:47.958 --> 00:05:49.958\nMobs provides different statistical breakdowns\n\n00:05:49.958 --> 00:05:52.958\nof the population of the world's feelings in the last few hours.\n\n00:05:52.958 --> 00:05:54.958\nWe see that \"better\" is the most frequent feeling right now,\n\n00:05:54.958 --> 00:05:58.958\nfollowed by \"good,\" \"bad,\" \"guilty,\" \"right,\" \"down,\" \"sick\" and so on.\n\n00:05:59.958 --> 00:06:00.958\nWe can also get a gender breakdown.\n\n00:06:00.958 --> 00:06:02.958\nAnd we see that women are slightly more prolific\n\n00:06:02.958 --> 00:06:04.958\ntalking about their emotions in the last few hours than men.\n\n00:06:06.958 --> 00:06:08.958\nWe can do an age breakdown, which gives us a histogram\n\n00:06:08.958 --> 00:06:10.958\nof the world's emotional distribution by age.\n\n00:06:11.958 --> 00:06:14.958\nWe see people in their twenties are the most prolific,\n\n00:06:14.958 --> 00:06:16.958\nfollowed by teenagers, and then people in their thirties,\n\n00:06:16.958 --> 00:06:17.958\nand it dies out very quickly from there.\n\n00:06:18.958 --> 00:06:22.958\nIn weather, the feelings assume the physical characteristics\n\n00:06:22.958 --> 00:06:23.958\nof the weather that they represent,\n\n00:06:23.958 --> 00:06:25.958\nso that the ones collected on a sunny day\n\n00:06:25.958 --> 00:06:27.958\nswirl around as if they're part of the sun.\n\n00:06:27.958 --> 00:06:29.958\nThe cloudy ones float along as if they're on a breeze.\n\n00:06:30.958 --> 00:06:32.958\nThe rainy ones fall down as if they're in a rainstorm,\n\n00:06:32.958 --> 00:06:34.958\nand the snowy ones kind of flutter to the ground.\n\n00:06:35.958 --> 00:06:38.958\nFinally, location causes the feelings to move to their positions\n\n00:06:38.958 --> 00:06:41.958\non a world map showing the geographical distribution of feelings.\n\n00:06:43.958 --> 00:06:45.958\nMetrics provides more numerical views on the data.\n\n00:06:45.958 --> 00:06:46.958\nWe see that the world is feeling \"used\"\n\n00:06:46.958 --> 00:06:49.958\nat 3.3 times the normal level right now.\n\n00:06:49.958 --> 00:06:52.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:06:52.958 --> 00:06:56.958\nThey're feeling \"warm\" at 2.9 times the normal level, and so on.\n\n00:06:56.958 --> 00:06:57.958\nOther views are also available.\n\n00:06:57.958 --> 00:06:59.958\nHere are gender, age, weather, location.\n\n00:06:59.958 --> 00:07:01.958\nThe final movement is called Mounds.\n\n00:07:01.958 --> 00:07:02.958\nIt's a bit different from the others.\n\n00:07:02.958 --> 00:07:06.958\nMounds visualizes the entire dataset as large, gelatinous blobs\n\n00:07:06.958 --> 00:07:07.958\nwhich kind of jiggle.\n\n00:07:08.958 --> 00:07:10.958\nAnd if I hold down my cursor, they do a little dance.\n\n00:07:11.958 --> 00:07:14.958\nWe see \"better\" is the most frequent feeling, followed by \"bad.\"\n\n00:07:14.958 --> 00:07:17.958\nAnd then if I go over here, the list begins to scroll,\n\n00:07:17.958 --> 00:07:19.958\nand there are actually thousands of feelings that have been collected.\n\n00:07:19.958 --> 00:07:21.958\nYou can see the little pink cursor moving along,\n\n00:07:21.958 --> 00:07:22.958\nrepresenting our position.\n\n00:07:23.958 --> 00:07:27.958\nHere we see people that feel \"slipping,\" \"nauseous,\" \"responsible.\"\n\n00:07:27.958 --> 00:07:28.958\nThere's also a search capability,\n\n00:07:28.958 --> 00:07:30.958\nif you're interested in finding out about a certain population.\n\n00:07:31.958 --> 00:07:33.958\nFor instance, you could find women who feel \"addicted\"\n\n00:07:33.958 --> 00:07:37.958\nin their 20s when it was cloudy in Bangladesh.\n\n00:07:37.958 --> 00:07:41.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:07:41.958 --> 00:07:42.958\nBut I'll spare you that.\n\n00:07:42.958 --> 00:07:45.958\nSo here are some of my favorite montages that have been collected:\n\n00:07:46.958 --> 00:07:49.958\n\"I feel so much of my dad alive in me that there isn't even room for me.\"\n\n00:07:51.958 --> 00:07:53.958\n\"I feel very lonely.\"\n\n00:07:55.958 --> 00:07:57.958\n\"I need to be in some backwoods redneck town\n\n00:07:57.958 --> 00:07:59.958\nso that I can feel beautiful.\"\n\n00:08:02.958 --> 00:08:03.958\n\"I feel invisible to you.\"\n\n00:08:05.958 --> 00:08:08.958\n\"I wouldn't hide it if society didn't make me feel like I needed to.\"\n\n00:08:11.958 --> 00:08:15.958\n\"I feel in love with Carolyn.\" \"I feel so naughty.\"\n\n00:08:18.958 --> 00:08:21.958\n\"I feel these weirdoes are actually an asset to college life.\"\n\n00:08:21.958 --> 00:08:25.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:08:25.958 --> 00:08:26.958\n\"I love how I feel today.\"\n\n00:08:28.958 --> 00:08:30.958\nSo as you can see, We Feel Fine uses a technique\n\n00:08:30.958 --> 00:08:31.958\nthat I call \"passive observation.\"\n\n00:08:31.958 --> 00:08:34.958\nWhat I mean by that is that it passively observes people\n\n00:08:34.958 --> 00:08:38.958\nas they live their lives. It scans the world's blogs\n\n00:08:38.958 --> 00:08:39.958\nand looks at what people are writing,\n\n00:08:39.958 --> 00:08:42.958\nand these people don't know they're being watched or interviewed.\n\n00:08:42.958 --> 00:08:43.958\nAnd because of that,\n\n00:08:43.958 --> 00:08:46.958\nyou end up getting very honest, candid, sincere responses\n\n00:08:46.958 --> 00:08:47.958\nthat are often very moving.\n\n00:08:48.958 --> 00:08:50.958\nAnd this is a technique that I usually prefer in my work\n\n00:08:50.958 --> 00:08:52.958\nbecause people don't know they're being interviewed.\n\n00:08:52.958 --> 00:08:55.958\nThey're just living life, and they end up just acting like that.\n\n00:08:56.958 --> 00:08:58.958\nAnother technique is directly questioning people.\n\n00:08:58.958 --> 00:09:00.958\nAnd this is a technique that I explored in a different project,\n\n00:09:00.958 --> 00:09:01.958\nthe Yahoo! Time Capsule,\n\n00:09:01.958 --> 00:09:05.958\nwhich was designed to take a fingerprint of the world in 2006.\n\n00:09:06.958 --> 00:09:08.958\nIt was divided into ten very simple themes --\n\n00:09:08.958 --> 00:09:10.958\nlove, anger, sadness and so on --\n\n00:09:10.958 --> 00:09:12.958\neach of which contained a single, very open-ended question\n\n00:09:12.958 --> 00:09:15.958\nput to the world: What do you love? What makes you angry?\n\n00:09:15.958 --> 00:09:17.958\nWhat makes you sad? What do you believe in? And so on.\n\n00:09:17.958 --> 00:09:19.958\nThe time capsule was available for one month online,\n\n00:09:19.958 --> 00:09:24.958\ntranslated into 10 languages, and this is what it looked like.\n\n00:09:24.958 --> 00:09:25.958\nIt's a spinning globe,\n\n00:09:25.958 --> 00:09:28.958\nthe surface of which is entirely composed of the pictures\n\n00:09:28.958 --> 00:09:30.958\nand words and drawings of people\n\n00:09:30.958 --> 00:09:31.958\nthat submitted to the time capsule.\n\n00:09:32.958 --> 00:09:34.958\nThe ten themes radiate out and orbit the time capsule.\n\n00:09:34.958 --> 00:09:38.958\nYou can sift through this data and see what people have submitted.\n\n00:09:38.958 --> 00:09:40.958\nThis is in response to, What's beautiful? \"Miss World.\"\n\n00:09:40.958 --> 00:09:42.958\nThere are two modes to the time capsule.\n\n00:09:42.958 --> 00:09:44.958\nThere's One World, which presents the spinning globe,\n\n00:09:44.958 --> 00:09:47.958\nand Many Voices, which splits the data out into film strips\n\n00:09:48.958 --> 00:09:49.958\nand lets you sift through them one by one.\n\n00:09:51.958 --> 00:09:55.958\nSo this project was punctuated by a really amazing event,\n\n00:09:55.958 --> 00:10:00.958\nwhich was held in the desert outside Albuquerque in New Mexico\n\n00:10:00.958 --> 00:10:02.958\nat the Jemez Pueblo, where for three consecutive nights,\n\n00:10:02.958 --> 00:10:05.958\nthe contents of the capsule were projected onto the sides\n\n00:10:05.958 --> 00:10:06.958\nof the ancient Red Rock Canyon walls,\n\n00:10:07.958 --> 00:10:09.958\nwhich stand about 200 feet tall. It was really incredible.\n\n00:10:09.958 --> 00:10:12.958\nAnd we also projected the contents of the time capsule\n\n00:10:12.958 --> 00:10:15.958\nas binary code using a 35-watt laser into outer space.\n\n00:10:15.958 --> 00:10:18.958\nYou can see the orange line leaving the desert floor\n\n00:10:18.958 --> 00:10:20.958\nat about a 45 degree angle there. This was amazing\n\n00:10:20.958 --> 00:10:24.958\nbecause the first night I looked at all this information\n\n00:10:24.958 --> 00:10:27.958\nand really started seeing the gaps that I talked about earlier --\n\n00:10:27.958 --> 00:10:29.958\nthe differences in age, gender and wealth and so on.\n\n00:10:30.958 --> 00:10:32.958\nBut, you know, as I looked at this more and more and more,\n\n00:10:32.958 --> 00:10:34.958\nand saw these images go across the rocks,\n\n00:10:34.958 --> 00:10:36.958\nI realized I was seeing the same archetypal events\n\n00:10:36.958 --> 00:10:38.958\ndepicted again and again and again.\n\n00:10:38.958 --> 00:10:43.958\nYou know: weddings, births, funerals, the first car, the first kiss,\n\n00:10:43.958 --> 00:10:46.958\nthe first camel or horse -- depending on the culture.\n\n00:10:46.958 --> 00:10:50.958\nAnd it was really moving. And this picture here was taken\n\n00:10:50.958 --> 00:10:53.958\nthe final night from a distant cliff about two miles away,\n\n00:10:53.958 --> 00:10:56.958\nwhere the contents of the capsule were being beamed into space.\n\n00:10:56.958 --> 00:10:58.958\nAnd there was something very moving\n\n00:10:58.958 --> 00:11:01.958\nabout all of this human expression being shot off into the night sky.\n\n00:11:01.958 --> 00:11:04.958\nAnd it started to make me think a lot about the night sky,\n\n00:11:04.958 --> 00:11:05.958\nand how humans have always used the night sky\n\n00:11:05.958 --> 00:11:07.958\nto project their great stories.\n\n00:11:07.958 --> 00:11:10.958\nYou know, as a child in Vermont, on a farm where I grew up,\n\n00:11:10.958 --> 00:11:12.958\nI would often look up into the dark sky\n\n00:11:12.958 --> 00:11:14.958\nand see the three star belt of Orion, the Hunter.\n\n00:11:15.958 --> 00:11:17.958\nAnd as an adult, I've been more aware\n\n00:11:17.958 --> 00:11:20.958\nof the great Greek myths playing out in the sky overhead every night.\n\n00:11:21.958 --> 00:11:23.958\nYou know, Orion facing the roaring bull.\n\n00:11:23.958 --> 00:11:25.958\nPerseus flying to the rescue of Andromeda.\n\n00:11:25.958 --> 00:11:28.958\nZeus battling Chronos for control of Mount Olympus.\n\n00:11:28.958 --> 00:11:30.958\nI mean, these are the great tales of the Greeks.\n\n00:11:30.958 --> 00:11:32.958\nAnd it caused me to wonder about our world today.\n\n00:11:33.958 --> 00:11:35.958\nAnd it caused me to wonder specifically,\n\n00:11:35.958 --> 00:11:37.958\nif we could make new constellations today,\n\n00:11:38.958 --> 00:11:40.958\nwhat would those look like? What would those be?\n\n00:11:40.958 --> 00:11:43.958\nIf we could make new pictures in the sky, what would we draw?\n\n00:11:43.958 --> 00:11:44.958\nWhat are the great stories of today?\n\n00:11:44.958 --> 00:11:48.958\nAnd those are the questions that inspired my new project,\n\n00:11:48.958 --> 00:11:50.958\nwhich is debuting here today at TED.\n\n00:11:50.958 --> 00:11:51.958\nNobody's seen this yet, publicly.\n\n00:11:52.958 --> 00:11:55.958\nIt's called Universe: Revealing Our Modern Mythology.\n\n00:11:56.958 --> 00:11:59.958\nAnd it uses this metaphor of an interactive night sky.\n\n00:11:59.958 --> 00:12:02.958\nSo, it's my great pleasure now to show this to you.\n\n00:12:02.958 --> 00:12:03.958\nSo, Universe will open here.\n\n00:12:03.958 --> 00:12:07.958\nAnd you'll see that it leads with a shifting star field,\n\n00:12:08.958 --> 00:12:10.958\nand there's an Aurora Borealis in the background,\n\n00:12:10.958 --> 00:12:13.958\nkind of morphing with color. The color of the Aurora Borealis\n\n00:12:13.958 --> 00:12:16.958\ncan be controlled using this single bar of color at the bottom,\n\n00:12:17.958 --> 00:12:19.958\nand we'll put it down here to red.\n\n00:12:19.958 --> 00:12:21.958\nSo you see this kind of -- these stars moving along.\n\n00:12:22.958 --> 00:12:25.958\nNow, these aren't just little points of light, little pixels.\n\n00:12:25.958 --> 00:12:27.958\nEach of those stars actually represents\n\n00:12:27.958 --> 00:12:29.958\na specific event in the real world --\n\n00:12:30.958 --> 00:12:32.958\na quote that was stated by somebody, an image,\n\n00:12:33.958 --> 00:12:36.958\na news story, a person, a company. You know,\n\n00:12:36.958 --> 00:12:38.958\nsome kind of heroic personality.\n\n00:12:39.958 --> 00:12:41.958\nAnd you might notice that as the cursor begins\n\n00:12:41.958 --> 00:12:45.958\nto touch some of these stars, that shapes begin to emerge.\n\n00:12:45.958 --> 00:12:48.958\nWe see here there's a little man walking along, or maybe a woman.\n\n00:12:48.958 --> 00:12:52.958\nAnd we see here a photograph with a head.\n\n00:12:53.958 --> 00:12:55.958\nYou can start to see words emerging here.\n\n00:12:56.958 --> 00:12:57.958\nAnd those are\n\n00:12:58.958 --> 00:12:59.958\nthe constellations of today.\n\n00:13:00.958 --> 00:13:01.958\nAnd I can turn them all on,\n\n00:13:01.958 --> 00:13:03.958\nand you can see them moving across the sky now.\n\n00:13:04.958 --> 00:13:06.958\nThis is the universe of 2007, the last two months.\n\n00:13:07.958 --> 00:13:09.958\nThe data from this is global news coverage\n\n00:13:09.958 --> 00:13:11.958\nfrom thousands of news sources around the world.\n\n00:13:11.958 --> 00:13:15.958\nIt's using the API of a really great company that I work with\n\n00:13:15.958 --> 00:13:16.958\nin New York, actually, called Daylife.\n\n00:13:17.958 --> 00:13:20.958\nAnd it's kind of the zeitgeist view at this level\n\n00:13:20.958 --> 00:13:24.958\nof the world's current mythology over the last couple of months.\n\n00:13:24.958 --> 00:13:27.958\nSo we can see where it's emerging here, like President Ford,\n\n00:13:28.958 --> 00:13:31.958\nIraq, Bush.

So there's Bill Clinton, Hillary,\n\n00:15:24.958 --> 00:15:28.958\nIraq, George Bush, Barack Obama, Scooter Libby --\n\n00:15:28.958 --> 00:15:30.958\nthese are kind of the people of Bill Clinton.\n\n00:15:31.958 --> 00:15:35.958\nWe can also see a world map, so this shows us the geographic reach\n\n00:15:35.958 --> 00:15:36.958\nof Bill Clinton in the last week or so.\n\n00:15:36.958 --> 00:15:38.958\nWe can see he's been focused in America\n\n00:15:38.958 --> 00:15:40.958\nbecause he's been campaigning, probably,\n\n00:15:40.958 --> 00:15:42.958\nbut a little bit of action over here in the Middle East.\n\n00:15:42.958 --> 00:15:44.958\nAnd then we can also see a timeline.\n\n00:15:44.958 --> 00:15:47.958\nSo we see that he was a bit quiet on Saturday,\n\n00:15:47.958 --> 00:15:49.958\nbut he was back to work on Sunday morning,\n\n00:15:49.958 --> 00:15:52.958\nand actually been tapering off since then this week.\n\n00:15:52.958 --> 00:15:54.958\nAnd it's not limited to just people or dates,\n\n00:15:54.958 --> 00:15:56.958\nbut we can actually put in concepts also.\n\n00:15:56.958 --> 00:15:59.958\nSo if I put in climate change for all of 2006,\n\n00:16:00.958 --> 00:16:02.958\nwe'll see what that universe looks like.\n\n00:16:02.958 --> 00:16:05.958\nHere we have our star field. Here we have our shapes.\n\n00:16:05.958 --> 00:16:07.958\nHere we have our secrets.\n\n00:16:08.958 --> 00:16:10.958\nSo we see again, climate change is large:\n\n00:16:10.958 --> 00:16:13.958\nNairobi, global conference, environmental.\n\n00:16:13.958 --> 00:16:15.958\nAnd there are also quotes that you can see,\n\n00:16:15.958 --> 00:16:17.958\nif you're interested in reading about quotes on climate change.\n\n00:16:17.958 --> 00:16:18.958\nYou know, this is really an infinite thing.\n\n00:16:19.958 --> 00:16:21.958\nThe superstars of climate change in 2006:\n\n00:16:21.958 --> 00:16:24.958\nUnited States, Britain, China. You know,\n\n00:16:24.958 --> 00:16:27.958\nthese are the towering countries that kind of define this concept.\n\n00:16:27.958 --> 00:16:30.958\nSo this is a piece that demands exploration.\n\n00:16:30.958 --> 00:16:34.958\nThis will be online in several days, probably next Tuesday.\n\n00:16:35.958 --> 00:16:39.958\nAnd you'll all be able to use it and kind of explore\n\n00:16:39.958 --> 00:16:41.958\nwhat your own personal mythology might be.\n\n00:16:41.958 --> 00:16:44.958\nYou'll notice that in Daylife -- rather, in Universe --\n\n00:16:44.958 --> 00:16:46.958\nit supports both the notion of a global mythology,\n\n00:16:46.958 --> 00:16:49.958\nwhich is represented by something as broad as, say, 2007,\n\n00:16:49.958 --> 00:16:51.958\nand also a personal mythology.\n\n00:16:51.958 --> 00:16:55.958\nAs you search for the things that are important to you in your world,\n\n00:16:55.958 --> 00:16:58.958\nand then see what the constellations of those might look like.\n\n00:16:59.958 --> 00:17:02.958\nSo it's been a pleasure.

And this is a pretty well-educated audience, so I imagine you all know something about AIDS. You probably know that roughly 25 million people in Africa are infected with the virus, that AIDS is a disease of poverty, and that if we can bring Africa out of poverty, we would decrease AIDS as well. If you know something more, you probably know that Uganda, to date, is the only country in sub-Saharan Africa that has had success in combating the epidemic. Using a campaign that encouraged people to abstain, be faithful, and use condoms \u2014 the ABC campaign \u2014 they decreased their prevalence in the 1990s from about 15 percent to 6 percent over just a few years. If you follow policy, you probably know that a few years ago the president pledged 15 billion dollars to fight the epidemic over five years, and a lot of that money is going to go to programs that try to replicate Uganda and use behavior change to encourage people and decrease the epidemic.So today I'm going to talk about some things that you might not know about the epidemic, and I'm actually also going to challenge some of these things that you think that you do know. To do that I'm going to talk about my research as an economist on the epidemic. And I'm not really going to talk much about the economy. I'm not going to tell you about exports and prices. But I'm going to use tools and ideas that are familiar to economists to think about a problem that's more traditionally part of public health and epidemiology. And I think in that sense, this fits really nicely with this lateral thinking idea. Here I'm really using the tools of one academic discipline to think about problems of another.So we think, first and foremost, AIDS is a policy issue. And probably for most people in this room, that's how you think about it. But this talk is going to be about understanding facts about the epidemic. It's going to be about thinking about how it evolves, and how people respond to it. I think it may seem like I'm ignoring the policy stuff, which is really the most important, but I'm hoping that at the end of this talk you will conclude that we actually cannot develop effective policy unless we really understand how the epidemic works.And the first thing that I want to talk about, the first thing I think we need to understand is: how do people respond to the epidemic? So AIDS is a sexually transmitted infection, and it kills you. So this means that in a place with a lot of AIDS, there's a really significant cost of sex. If you're an uninfected man living in Botswana, where the HIV rate is 30 percent, if you have one more partner this year \u2014 a long-term partner, girlfriend, mistress \u2014 your chance of dying in 10 years increases by three percentage points.That is a huge effect. And so I think that we really feel like then people should have less sex. And in fact among gay men in the US we did see that kind of change in the 1980s. So if we look in this particularly high-risk sample, they're being asked, \"Did you have more than one unprotected sexual partner in the last two months?\" Over a period from '84 to '88, that share drops from about 85 percent to 55 percent. It's a huge change in a very short period of time.We didn't see anything like that in Africa. So we don't have quite as good data, but you can see here the share of single men having pre-marital sex, or married men having extra-marital sex, and how that changes from the early '90s to late '90s, and late '90s to early 2000s. The epidemic is getting worse. People are learning more things about it. We see almost no change in sexual behavior. These are just tiny decreases \u2014 two percentage points \u2014 not significant.This seems puzzling. But I'm going to argue that you shouldn't be surprised by this, and that to understand this you need to think about health the way than an economist does \u2014 as an investment. So if you're a software engineer and you're trying to think about whether to add some new functionality to your program, it's important to think about how much it costs. It's also important to think about what the benefit is. And one part of that benefit is how much longer you think this program is going to be active. If version 10 is coming out next week, there's no point in adding more functionality into version nine.But your health decisions are the same. Every time you have a carrot instead of a cookie, every time you go to the gym instead of going to the movies, that's a costly investment in your health. But how much you want to invest is going to depend on how much longer you expect to live in the future, even if you don't make those investments. AIDS is the same kind of thing. It's costly to avoid AIDS. People really like to have sex. But, you know, it has a benefit in terms of future longevity. But life expectancy in Africa, even without AIDS, is really, really low: 40 or 50 years in a lot of places. I think it's possible, if we think about that intuition, and think about that fact, that maybe that explains some of this low behavior change.But we really need to test that. And a great way to test that is to look across areas in Africa and see: do people with more life expectancy change their sexual behavior more? And the way that I'm going to do that is, I'm going to look across areas with different levels of malaria. So malaria is a disease that kills you. It's a disease that kills a lot of adults in Africa, in addition to a lot of children. And so people who live in areas with a lot of malaria are going to have lower life expectancy than people who live in areas with limited malaria. So one way to test to see whether we can explain some of this behavior change by differences in life expectancy is to look and see is there more behavior change in areas where there's less malaria.So that's what this figure shows you. This shows you \u2014 in areas with low malaria, medium malaria, high malaria \u2014 what happens to the number of sexual partners as you increase HIV prevalence. If you look at the blue line, the areas with low levels of malaria, you can see in those areas, actually, the number of sexual partners is decreasing a lot as HIV prevalence goes up. Areas with medium levels of malaria it decreases some \u2014 it doesn't decrease as much. And areas with high levels of malaria \u2014 actually, it's increasing a little bit, although that's not significant.This is not just through malaria. Young women who live in areas with high maternal mortality change their behavior less in response to HIV than young women who live in areas with low maternal mortality. There's another risk, and they respond less to this existing risk.So by itself, I think this tells a lot about how people behave. It tells us something about why we see limited behavior change in Africa.But it also tells us something about policy. Even if you only cared about AIDS in Africa, it might still be a good idea to invest in malaria, in combating poor indoor air quality, in improving maternal mortality rates. Because if you improve those things, then people are going to have an incentive to avoid AIDS on their own. But it also tells us something about one of these facts that we talked about before. Education campaigns, like the one that the president is focusing on in his funding, may not be enough, at least not alone. If people have no incentive to avoid AIDS on their own, even if they know everything about the disease, they still may not change their behavior.So the other thing that I think we learn here is that AIDS is not going to fix itself. People aren't changing their behavior enough to decrease the growth in the epidemic. So we're going to need to think about policy and what kind of policies might be effective.And a great way to learn about policy is to look at what worked in the past. The reason that we know that the ABC campaign was effective in Uganda is we have good data on prevalence over time. In Uganda we see the prevalence went down. We know they had this campaign. That's how we learn about what works. It's not the only place we had any interventions. Other places have tried things, so why don't we look at those places and see what happened to their prevalence?Unfortunately, there's almost no good data on HIV prevalence in the general population in Africa until about 2003. So if I asked you, \"Why don't you go and find me the prevalence in Burkina Faso in 1991?\" You get on Google, you Google, and you find, actually the only people tested in Burkina Faso in 1991 are STD patients and pregnant women, which is not a terribly representative group of people. Then if you poked a little more, you looked a little more at what was going on, you'd find that actually that was a pretty good year, because in some years the only people tested are IV drug users. But even worse \u2014 some years it's only IV drug users, some years it's only pregnant women. We have no way to figure out what happened over time. We have no consistent testing.Now in the last few years, we actually have done some good testing. In Kenya, in Zambia, and a bunch of countries, there's been testing in random samples of the population. But this leaves us with a big gap in our knowledge. So I can tell you what the prevalence was in Kenya in 2003, but I can't tell you anything about 1993 or 1983.So this is a problem for policy. It was a problem for my research. And I started thinking about how else might we figure out what the prevalence of HIV was in Africa in the past. And I think that the answer is, we can look at mortality data, and we can use mortality data to figure out what the prevalence was in the past.To do this, we're going to have to rely on the fact that AIDS is a very specific kind of disease. It kills people in the prime of their lives. Not a lot of other diseases have that profile. And you can see here \u2014 this is a graph of death rates by age in Botswana and Egypt. Botswana is a place with a lot of AIDS, Egypt is a place without a lot of AIDS. And you see they have pretty similar death rates among young kids and old people. That suggests it's pretty similar levels of development.But in this middle region, between 20 and 45, the death rates in Botswana are much, much, much higher than in Egypt. But since there are very few other diseases that kill people, we can really attribute that mortality to HIV. But because people who died this year of AIDS got it a few years ago, we can use this data on mortality to figure out what HIV prevalence was in the past. So it turns out, if you use this technique, actually your estimates of prevalence are very close to what we get from testing random samples in the population, but they're very, very different than what UNAIDS tells us the prevalences are.So this is a graph of prevalence estimated by UNAIDS, and prevalence based on the mortality data for the years in the late 1990s in nine countries in Africa. You can see, almost without exception, the UNAIDS estimates are much higher than the mortality-based estimates. UNAIDS tell us that the HIV rate in Zambia is 20 percent, and mortality estimates suggest it's only about 5 percent. And these are not trivial differences in mortality rates. So this is another way to see this. You can see that for the prevalence to be as high as UNAIDS says, we have to really see 60 deaths per 10,000 rather than 20 deaths per 10,000 in this age group.I'm going to talk a little bit in a minute about how we can use this kind of information to learn something that's going to help us think about the world. But this also tells us that one of these facts that I mentioned in the beginning may not be quite right. If you think that 25 million people are infected, if you think that the UNAIDS numbers are much too high, maybe that's more like 10 or 15 million. It doesn't mean that AIDS isn't a problem. It's a gigantic problem. But it does suggest that that number might be a little big. What I really want to do, is I want to use this new data to try to figure out what makes the HIV epidemic grow faster or slower.And I said in the beginning, I wasn't going to tell you about exports. When I started working on these projects, I was not thinking at all about economics, but eventually it kind of sucks you back in. So I am going to talk about exports and prices. And I want to talk about the relationship between economic activity, in particular export volume, and HIV infections.So obviously, as an economist, I'm deeply familiar with the fact that development, that openness to trade, is really good for developing countries. It's good for improving people's lives. But openness and inter-connectedness, it comes with a cost when we think about disease. I don't think this should be a surprise. On Wednesday, I learned from Laurie Garrett that I'm definitely going to get the bird flu, and I wouldn't be at all worried about that if we never had any contact with Asia.And HIV is actually particularly closely linked to transit. The epidemic was introduced to the US by actually one male steward on an airline flight, who got the disease in Africa and brought it back. And that was the genesis of the entire epidemic in the US. In Africa, epidemiologists have noted for a long time that truck drivers and migrants are more likely to be infected than other people. Areas with a lot of economic activity \u2014 with a lot of roads, with a lot of urbanization \u2014 those areas have higher prevalence than others.But that actually doesn't mean at all that if we gave people more exports, more trade, that that would increase prevalence. By using this new data, using this information about prevalence over time, we can actually test that. And so it seems to be \u2014 fortunately, I think \u2014 it seems to be the case that these things are positively related. More exports means more AIDS. And that effect is really big. So the data that I have suggests that if you double export volume, it will lead to a quadrupling of new HIV infections.So this has important implications both for forecasting and for policy. From a forecasting perspective, if we know where trade is likely to change, for example, because of the African Growth and Opportunities Act or other policies that encourage trade, we can actually think about which areas are likely to be heavily infected with HIV. And we can go and we can try to have pre-emptive preventive measures there. Likewise, as we're developing policies to try to encourage exports, if we know there's this externality \u2014 this extra thing that's going to happen as we increase exports \u2014 we can think about what the right kinds of policies are.But it also tells us something about one of these things that we think that we know. Even though it is the case that poverty is linked to AIDS, in the sense that Africa is poor and they have a lot of AIDS, it's not necessarily the case that improving poverty \u2014 at least in the short run, that improving exports and improving development \u2014 it's not necessarily the case that that's going to lead to a decline in HIV prevalence.So throughout this talk I've mentioned a few times the special case of Uganda, and the fact that it's the only country in sub-Saharan Africa with successful prevention. It's been widely heralded. It's been replicated in Kenya, and Tanzania, and South Africa and many other places. But now I want to actually also question that. Because it is true that there was a decline in prevalence in Uganda in the 1990s. It's true that they had an education campaign. But there was actually something else that happened in Uganda in this period.There was a big decline in coffee prices. Coffee is Uganda's major export. Their exports went down a lot in the early 1990s \u2014 and actually that decline lines up really, really closely with this decline in new HIV infections. So you can see that both of these series \u2014 the black line is export value, the red line is new HIV infections \u2014 you can see they're both increasing. Starting about 1987 they're both going down a lot. And then actually they track each other a little bit on the increase later in the decade.So if you combine the intuition in this figure with some of the data that I talked about before, it suggests that somewhere between 25 percent and 50 percent of the decline in prevalence in Uganda actually would have happened even without any education campaign.But that's enormously important for policy. We're spending so much money to try to replicate this campaign. And if it was only 50 percent as effective as we think that it was, then there are all sorts of other things maybe we should be spending our money on instead. Trying to change transmission rates by treating other sexually transmitted diseases. Trying to change them by engaging in male circumcision. There are tons of other things that we should think about doing. And maybe this tells us that we should be thinking more about those things.I hope that in the last 16 minutes I've told you something that you didn't know about AIDS, and I hope that I've gotten you questioning a little bit some of the things that you did know. And I hope that I've convinced you maybe that it's important to understand things about the epidemic in order to think about policy.But more than anything, you know, I'm an academic. And when I leave here, I'm going to go back and sit in my tiny office, and my computer, and my data. And the thing that's most exciting about that is every time I think about research, there are more questions. There are more things that I think that I want to do. And what's really, really great about being here is I'm sure that the questions that you guys have are very, very different than the questions that I think up myself. And I can't wait to hear about what they are. So thank you very much.", "id": 143, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:12.958 --> 00:00:15.958\nSo I want to talk to you today about AIDS in sub-Saharan Africa.\n\n00:00:15.958 --> 00:00:17.958\nAnd this is a pretty well-educated audience,\n\n00:00:17.958 --> 00:00:20.958\nso I imagine you all know something about AIDS.\n\n00:00:20.958 --> 00:00:22.958\nYou probably know that roughly 25 million people in Africa\n\n00:00:22.958 --> 00:00:26.958\nare infected with the virus, that AIDS is a disease of poverty,\n\n00:00:26.958 --> 00:00:30.958\nand that if we can bring Africa out of poverty, we would decrease AIDS as well.\n\n00:00:30.958 --> 00:00:33.958\nIf you know something more, you probably know that Uganda, to date,\n\n00:00:33.958 --> 00:00:35.958\nis the only country in sub-Saharan Africa\n\n00:00:35.958 --> 00:00:38.958\nthat has had success in combating the epidemic.\n\n00:00:38.958 --> 00:00:42.958\nUsing a campaign that encouraged people to abstain, be faithful, and use condoms --\n\n00:00:42.958 --> 00:00:46.958\nthe ABC campaign -- they decreased their prevalence in the 1990s\n\n00:00:46.958 --> 00:00:50.958\nfrom about 15 percent to 6 percent over just a few years.\n\n00:00:50.958 --> 00:00:53.958\nIf you follow policy, you probably know that a few years ago\n\n00:00:53.958 --> 00:00:57.958\nthe president pledged 15 billion dollars to fight the epidemic over five years,\n\n00:00:57.958 --> 00:01:00.958\nand a lot of that money is going to go to programs that try to replicate Uganda\n\n00:01:00.958 --> 00:01:06.958\nand use behavior change to encourage people and decrease the epidemic.\n\n00:01:06.958 --> 00:01:08.958\nSo today I'm going to talk about some things\n\n00:01:08.958 --> 00:01:10.958\nthat you might not know about the epidemic,\n\n00:01:10.958 --> 00:01:12.958\nand I'm actually also going to challenge\n\n00:01:12.958 --> 00:01:14.958\nsome of these things that you think that you do know.\n\n00:01:14.958 --> 00:01:17.958\nTo do that I'm going to talk about my research\n\n00:01:17.958 --> 00:01:19.958\nas an economist on the epidemic.\n\n00:01:19.958 --> 00:01:21.958\nAnd I'm not really going to talk much about the economy.\n\n00:01:21.958 --> 00:01:24.958\nI'm not going to tell you about exports and prices.\n\n00:01:24.958 --> 00:01:28.958\nBut I'm going to use tools and ideas that are familiar to economists\n\n00:01:28.958 --> 00:01:30.958\nto think about a problem that's more traditionally\n\n00:01:30.958 --> 00:01:32.958\npart of public health and epidemiology.\n\n00:01:32.958 --> 00:01:36.958\nAnd I think in that sense, this fits really nicely with this lateral thinking idea.\n\n00:01:36.958 --> 00:01:39.958\nHere I'm really using the tools of one academic discipline\n\n00:01:39.958 --> 00:01:41.958\nto think about problems of another.\n\n00:01:41.958 --> 00:01:44.958\nSo we think, first and foremost, AIDS is a policy issue.\n\n00:01:44.958 --> 00:01:47.958\nAnd probably for most people in this room, that's how you think about it.\n\n00:01:47.958 --> 00:01:51.958\nBut this talk is going to be about understanding facts about the epidemic.\n\n00:01:51.958 --> 00:01:54.958\nIt's going to be about thinking about how it evolves, and how people respond to it.\n\n00:01:54.958 --> 00:01:57.958\nI think it may seem like I'm ignoring the policy stuff,\n\n00:01:57.958 --> 00:01:59.958\nwhich is really the most important,\n\n00:01:59.958 --> 00:02:01.958\nbut I'm hoping that at the end of this talk you will conclude\n\n00:02:01.958 --> 00:02:03.958\nthat we actually cannot develop effective policy\n\n00:02:03.958 --> 00:02:06.958\nunless we really understand how the epidemic works.\n\n00:02:06.958 --> 00:02:08.958\nAnd the first thing that I want to talk about,\n\n00:02:08.958 --> 00:02:10.958\nthe first thing I think we need to understand is:\n\n00:02:10.958 --> 00:02:12.958\nhow do people respond to the epidemic?\n\n00:02:12.958 --> 00:02:16.958\nSo AIDS is a sexually transmitted infection, and it kills you.\n\n00:02:16.958 --> 00:02:18.958\nSo this means that in a place with a lot of AIDS,\n\n00:02:18.958 --> 00:02:20.958\nthere's a really significant cost of sex.\n\n00:02:20.958 --> 00:02:24.958\nIf you're an uninfected man living in Botswana, where the HIV rate is 30 percent,\n\n00:02:24.958 --> 00:02:28.958\nif you have one more partner this year -- a long-term partner, girlfriend, mistress --\n\n00:02:28.958 --> 00:02:32.958\nyour chance of dying in 10 years increases by three percentage points.\n\n00:02:32.958 --> 00:02:34.958\nThat is a huge effect.\n\n00:02:34.958 --> 00:02:37.958\nAnd so I think that we really feel like then people should have less sex.\n\n00:02:37.958 --> 00:02:39.958\nAnd in fact among gay men in the US\n\n00:02:39.958 --> 00:02:41.958\nwe did see that kind of change in the 1980s.\n\n00:02:41.958 --> 00:02:45.958\nSo if we look in this particularly high-risk sample, they're being asked,\n\n00:02:45.958 --> 00:02:48.958\n\"Did you have more than one unprotected sexual partner in the last two months?\"\n\n00:02:48.958 --> 00:02:54.958\nOver a period from '84 to '88, that share drops from about 85 percent to 55 percent.\n\n00:02:54.958 --> 00:02:56.958\nIt's a huge change in a very short period of time.\n\n00:02:56.958 --> 00:02:58.958\nWe didn't see anything like that in Africa.\n\n00:02:58.958 --> 00:03:01.958\nSo we don't have quite as good data, but you can see here\n\n00:03:01.958 --> 00:03:03.958\nthe share of single men having pre-marital sex,\n\n00:03:03.958 --> 00:03:05.958\nor married men having extra-marital sex,\n\n00:03:05.958 --> 00:03:08.958\nand how that changes from the early '90s to late '90s,\n\n00:03:08.958 --> 00:03:11.958\nand late '90s to early 2000s. The epidemic is getting worse.\n\n00:03:11.958 --> 00:03:13.958\nPeople are learning more things about it.\n\n00:03:13.958 --> 00:03:15.958\nWe see almost no change in sexual behavior.\n\n00:03:15.958 --> 00:03:19.958\nThese are just tiny decreases -- two percentage points -- not significant.\n\n00:03:19.958 --> 00:03:23.958\nThis seems puzzling. But I'm going to argue that you shouldn't be surprised by this,\n\n00:03:23.958 --> 00:03:26.958\nand that to understand this you need to think about health\n\n00:03:26.958 --> 00:03:29.958\nthe way than an economist does -- as an investment.\n\n00:03:29.958 --> 00:03:32.958\nSo if you're a software engineer and you're trying to think about\n\n00:03:32.958 --> 00:03:35.958\nwhether to add some new functionality to your program,\n\n00:03:35.958 --> 00:03:37.958\nit's important to think about how much it costs.\n\n00:03:37.958 --> 00:03:39.958\nIt's also important to think about what the benefit is.\n\n00:03:39.958 --> 00:03:41.958\nAnd one part of that benefit is how much longer\n\n00:03:41.958 --> 00:03:43.958\nyou think this program is going to be active.\n\n00:03:43.958 --> 00:03:45.958\nIf version 10 is coming out next week,\n\n00:03:45.958 --> 00:03:48.958\nthere's no point in adding more functionality into version nine.\n\n00:03:48.958 --> 00:03:50.958\nBut your health decisions are the same.\n\n00:03:50.958 --> 00:03:52.958\nEvery time you have a carrot instead of a cookie,\n\n00:03:52.958 --> 00:03:55.958\nevery time you go to the gym instead of going to the movies,\n\n00:03:55.958 --> 00:03:57.958\nthat's a costly investment in your health.\n\n00:03:57.958 --> 00:03:59.958\nBut how much you want to invest is going to depend\n\n00:03:59.958 --> 00:04:01.958\non how much longer you expect to live in the future,\n\n00:04:01.958 --> 00:04:03.958\neven if you don't make those investments.\n\n00:04:03.958 --> 00:04:06.958\nAIDS is the same kind of thing. It's costly to avoid AIDS.\n\n00:04:06.958 --> 00:04:09.958\nPeople really like to have sex.\n\n00:04:09.958 --> 00:04:15.958\nBut, you know, it has a benefit in terms of future longevity.\n\n00:04:15.958 --> 00:04:19.958\nBut life expectancy in Africa, even without AIDS, is really, really low:\n\n00:04:19.958 --> 00:04:22.958\n40 or 50 years in a lot of places.\n\n00:04:22.958 --> 00:04:26.958\nI think it's possible, if we think about that intuition, and think about that fact,\n\n00:04:26.958 --> 00:04:29.958\nthat maybe that explains some of this low behavior change.\n\n00:04:29.958 --> 00:04:31.958\nBut we really need to test that.\n\n00:04:31.958 --> 00:04:34.958\nAnd a great way to test that is to look across areas in Africa and see:\n\n00:04:34.958 --> 00:04:38.958\ndo people with more life expectancy change their sexual behavior more?\n\n00:04:38.958 --> 00:04:40.958\nAnd the way that I'm going to do that is,\n\n00:04:40.958 --> 00:04:43.958\nI'm going to look across areas with different levels of malaria.\n\n00:04:43.958 --> 00:04:46.958\nSo malaria is a disease that kills you.\n\n00:04:46.958 --> 00:04:49.958\nIt's a disease that kills a lot of adults in Africa, in addition to a lot of children.\n\n00:04:49.958 --> 00:04:52.958\nAnd so people who live in areas with a lot of malaria\n\n00:04:52.958 --> 00:04:56.958\nare going to have lower life expectancy than people who live in areas with limited malaria.\n\n00:04:56.958 --> 00:04:58.958\nSo one way to test to see whether we can explain\n\n00:04:58.958 --> 00:05:01.958\nsome of this behavior change by differences in life expectancy\n\n00:05:01.958 --> 00:05:04.958\nis to look and see is there more behavior change\n\n00:05:04.958 --> 00:05:06.958\nin areas where there's less malaria.\n\n00:05:06.958 --> 00:05:08.958\nSo that's what this figure shows you.\n\n00:05:08.958 --> 00:05:12.958\nThis shows you -- in areas with low malaria, medium malaria, high malaria --\n\n00:05:12.958 --> 00:05:16.958\nwhat happens to the number of sexual partners as you increase HIV prevalence.\n\n00:05:16.958 --> 00:05:18.958\nIf you look at the blue line,\n\n00:05:18.958 --> 00:05:21.958\nthe areas with low levels of malaria, you can see in those areas,\n\n00:05:21.958 --> 00:05:24.958\nactually, the number of sexual partners is decreasing a lot\n\n00:05:24.958 --> 00:05:26.958\nas HIV prevalence goes up.\n\n00:05:26.958 --> 00:05:28.958\nAreas with medium levels of malaria it decreases some --\n\n00:05:28.958 --> 00:05:31.958\nit doesn't decrease as much. And areas with high levels of malaria --\n\n00:05:31.958 --> 00:05:36.958\nactually, it's increasing a little bit, although that's not significant.\n\n00:05:36.958 --> 00:05:38.958\nThis is not just through malaria.\n\n00:05:38.958 --> 00:05:41.958\nYoung women who live in areas with high maternal mortality\n\n00:05:41.958 --> 00:05:44.958\nchange their behavior less in response to HIV\n\n00:05:44.958 --> 00:05:47.958\nthan young women who live in areas with low maternal mortality.\n\n00:05:47.958 --> 00:05:51.958\nThere's another risk, and they respond less to this existing risk.\n\n00:05:52.958 --> 00:05:55.958\nSo by itself, I think this tells a lot about how people behave.\n\n00:05:55.958 --> 00:05:58.958\nIt tells us something about why we see limited behavior change in Africa.\n\n00:05:58.958 --> 00:06:00.958\nBut it also tells us something about policy.\n\n00:06:00.958 --> 00:06:03.958\nEven if you only cared about AIDS in Africa,\n\n00:06:03.958 --> 00:06:06.958\nit might still be a good idea to invest in malaria,\n\n00:06:06.958 --> 00:06:08.958\nin combating poor indoor air quality,\n\n00:06:08.958 --> 00:06:10.958\nin improving maternal mortality rates.\n\n00:06:10.958 --> 00:06:12.958\nBecause if you improve those things,\n\n00:06:12.958 --> 00:06:16.958\nthen people are going to have an incentive to avoid AIDS on their own.\n\n00:06:16.958 --> 00:06:20.958\nBut it also tells us something about one of these facts that we talked about before.\n\n00:06:20.958 --> 00:06:24.958\nEducation campaigns, like the one that the president is focusing on in his funding,\n\n00:06:24.958 --> 00:06:26.958\nmay not be enough, at least not alone.\n\n00:06:26.958 --> 00:06:28.958\nIf people have no incentive to avoid AIDS on their own,\n\n00:06:28.958 --> 00:06:30.958\neven if they know everything about the disease,\n\n00:06:30.958 --> 00:06:32.958\nthey still may not change their behavior.\n\n00:06:32.958 --> 00:06:35.958\nSo the other thing that I think we learn here is that AIDS is not going to fix itself.\n\n00:06:35.958 --> 00:06:37.958\nPeople aren't changing their behavior enough\n\n00:06:37.958 --> 00:06:40.958\nto decrease the growth in the epidemic.\n\n00:06:40.958 --> 00:06:42.958\nSo we're going to need to think about policy\n\n00:06:42.958 --> 00:06:44.958\nand what kind of policies might be effective.\n\n00:06:44.958 --> 00:06:47.958\nAnd a great way to learn about policy is to look at what worked in the past.\n\n00:06:47.958 --> 00:06:49.958\nThe reason that we know that the ABC campaign\n\n00:06:49.958 --> 00:06:52.958\nwas effective in Uganda is we have good data on prevalence over time.\n\n00:06:52.958 --> 00:06:54.958\nIn Uganda we see the prevalence went down.\n\n00:06:54.958 --> 00:06:57.958\nWe know they had this campaign. That's how we learn about what works.\n\n00:06:57.958 --> 00:06:59.958\nIt's not the only place we had any interventions.\n\n00:06:59.958 --> 00:07:03.958\nOther places have tried things, so why don't we look at those places\n\n00:07:03.958 --> 00:07:06.958\nand see what happened to their prevalence?\n\n00:07:06.958 --> 00:07:08.958\nUnfortunately, there's almost no good data\n\n00:07:08.958 --> 00:07:13.958\non HIV prevalence in the general population in Africa until about 2003.\n\n00:07:13.958 --> 00:07:15.958\nSo if I asked you, \"Why don't you go and find me\n\n00:07:15.958 --> 00:07:18.958\nthe prevalence in Burkina Faso in 1991?\"\n\n00:07:18.958 --> 00:07:21.958\nYou get on Google, you Google, and you find,\n\n00:07:21.958 --> 00:07:24.958\nactually the only people tested in Burkina Faso in 1991\n\n00:07:24.958 --> 00:07:26.958\nare STD patients and pregnant women,\n\n00:07:26.958 --> 00:07:28.958\nwhich is not a terribly representative group of people.\n\n00:07:28.958 --> 00:07:31.958\nThen if you poked a little more, you looked a little more at what was going on,\n\n00:07:31.958 --> 00:07:34.958\nyou'd find that actually that was a pretty good year,\n\n00:07:34.958 --> 00:07:37.958\nbecause in some years the only people tested are IV drug users.\n\n00:07:37.958 --> 00:07:39.958\nBut even worse -- some years it's only IV drug users,\n\n00:07:39.958 --> 00:07:41.958\nsome years it's only pregnant women.\n\n00:07:41.958 --> 00:07:43.958\nWe have no way to figure out what happened over time.\n\n00:07:43.958 --> 00:07:45.958\nWe have no consistent testing.\n\n00:07:45.958 --> 00:07:50.958\nNow in the last few years, we actually have done some good testing.\n\n00:07:50.958 --> 00:07:53.958\nIn Kenya, in Zambia, and a bunch of countries,\n\n00:07:53.958 --> 00:07:56.958\nthere's been testing in random samples of the population.\n\n00:07:56.958 --> 00:07:59.958\nBut this leaves us with a big gap in our knowledge.\n\n00:07:59.958 --> 00:08:02.958\nSo I can tell you what the prevalence was in Kenya in 2003,\n\n00:08:02.958 --> 00:08:05.958\nbut I can't tell you anything about 1993 or 1983.\n\n00:08:05.958 --> 00:08:09.958\nSo this is a problem for policy. It was a problem for my research.\n\n00:08:09.958 --> 00:08:13.958\nAnd I started thinking about how else might we figure out\n\n00:08:13.958 --> 00:08:15.958\nwhat the prevalence of HIV was in Africa in the past.\n\n00:08:15.958 --> 00:08:19.958\nAnd I think that the answer is, we can look at mortality data,\n\n00:08:19.958 --> 00:08:23.958\nand we can use mortality data to figure out what the prevalence was in the past.\n\n00:08:23.958 --> 00:08:25.958\nTo do this, we're going to have to rely on the fact\n\n00:08:25.958 --> 00:08:27.958\nthat AIDS is a very specific kind of disease.\n\n00:08:27.958 --> 00:08:29.958\nIt kills people in the prime of their lives.\n\n00:08:29.958 --> 00:08:32.958\nNot a lot of other diseases have that profile. And you can see here --\n\n00:08:32.958 --> 00:08:36.958\nthis is a graph of death rates by age in Botswana and Egypt.\n\n00:08:36.958 --> 00:08:38.958\nBotswana is a place with a lot of AIDS,\n\n00:08:38.958 --> 00:08:40.958\nEgypt is a place without a lot of AIDS.\n\n00:08:40.958 --> 00:08:43.958\nAnd you see they have pretty similar death rates among young kids and old people.\n\n00:08:43.958 --> 00:08:46.958\nThat suggests it's pretty similar levels of development.\n\n00:08:46.958 --> 00:08:49.958\nBut in this middle region, between 20 and 45,\n\n00:08:49.958 --> 00:08:53.958\nthe death rates in Botswana are much, much, much higher than in Egypt.\n\n00:08:53.958 --> 00:08:57.958\nBut since there are very few other diseases that kill people,\n\n00:08:57.958 --> 00:09:00.958\nwe can really attribute that mortality to HIV.\n\n00:09:00.958 --> 00:09:04.958\nBut because people who died this year of AIDS got it a few years ago,\n\n00:09:04.958 --> 00:09:09.958\nwe can use this data on mortality to figure out what HIV prevalence was in the past.\n\n00:09:09.958 --> 00:09:11.958\nSo it turns out, if you use this technique,\n\n00:09:11.958 --> 00:09:13.958\nactually your estimates of prevalence are very close\n\n00:09:13.958 --> 00:09:16.958\nto what we get from testing random samples in the population,\n\n00:09:16.958 --> 00:09:21.958\nbut they're very, very different than what UNAIDS tells us the prevalences are.\n\n00:09:21.958 --> 00:09:24.958\nSo this is a graph of prevalence estimated by UNAIDS,\n\n00:09:24.958 --> 00:09:26.958\nand prevalence based on the mortality data\n\n00:09:26.958 --> 00:09:30.958\nfor the years in the late 1990s in nine countries in Africa.\n\n00:09:30.958 --> 00:09:32.958\nYou can see, almost without exception,\n\n00:09:32.958 --> 00:09:36.958\nthe UNAIDS estimates are much higher than the mortality-based estimates.\n\n00:09:36.958 --> 00:09:40.958\nUNAIDS tell us that the HIV rate in Zambia is 20 percent,\n\n00:09:40.958 --> 00:09:44.958\nand mortality estimates suggest it's only about 5 percent.\n\n00:09:44.958 --> 00:09:47.958\nAnd these are not trivial differences in mortality rates.\n\n00:09:47.958 --> 00:09:49.958\nSo this is another way to see this.\n\n00:09:49.958 --> 00:09:51.958\nYou can see that for the prevalence to be as high as UNAIDS says,\n\n00:09:51.958 --> 00:09:53.958\nwe have to really see 60 deaths per 10,000\n\n00:09:53.958 --> 00:09:57.958\nrather than 20 deaths per 10,000 in this age group.\n\n00:09:57.958 --> 00:09:59.958\nI'm going to talk a little bit in a minute\n\n00:09:59.958 --> 00:10:02.958\nabout how we can use this kind of information to learn something\n\n00:10:02.958 --> 00:10:04.958\nthat's going to help us think about the world.\n\n00:10:04.958 --> 00:10:06.958\nBut this also tells us that one of these facts\n\n00:10:06.958 --> 00:10:09.958\nthat I mentioned in the beginning may not be quite right.\n\n00:10:09.958 --> 00:10:11.958\nIf you think that 25 million people are infected,\n\n00:10:11.958 --> 00:10:14.958\nif you think that the UNAIDS numbers are much too high,\n\n00:10:14.958 --> 00:10:16.958\nmaybe that's more like 10 or 15 million.\n\n00:10:16.958 --> 00:10:20.958\nIt doesn't mean that AIDS isn't a problem. It's a gigantic problem.\n\n00:10:20.958 --> 00:10:24.958\nBut it does suggest that that number might be a little big.\n\n00:10:24.958 --> 00:10:26.958\nWhat I really want to do, is I want to use this new data\n\n00:10:26.958 --> 00:10:30.958\nto try to figure out what makes the HIV epidemic grow faster or slower.\n\n00:10:30.958 --> 00:10:33.958\nAnd I said in the beginning, I wasn't going to tell you about exports.\n\n00:10:33.958 --> 00:10:35.958\nWhen I started working on these projects,\n\n00:10:35.958 --> 00:10:37.958\nI was not thinking at all about economics,\n\n00:10:37.958 --> 00:10:40.958\nbut eventually it kind of sucks you back in.\n\n00:10:40.958 --> 00:10:43.958\nSo I am going to talk about exports and prices.\n\n00:10:43.958 --> 00:10:46.958\nAnd I want to talk about the relationship between economic activity,\n\n00:10:46.958 --> 00:10:50.958\nin particular export volume, and HIV infections.\n\n00:10:50.958 --> 00:10:54.958\nSo obviously, as an economist, I'm deeply familiar\n\n00:10:54.958 --> 00:10:56.958\nwith the fact that development, that openness to trade,\n\n00:10:56.958 --> 00:10:58.958\nis really good for developing countries.\n\n00:10:58.958 --> 00:11:01.958\nIt's good for improving people's lives.\n\n00:11:01.958 --> 00:11:03.958\nBut openness and inter-connectedness, it comes with a cost\n\n00:11:03.958 --> 00:11:06.958\nwhen we think about disease. I don't think this should be a surprise.\n\n00:11:06.958 --> 00:11:08.958\nOn Wednesday, I learned from Laurie Garrett\n\n00:11:08.958 --> 00:11:10.958\nthat I'm definitely going to get the bird flu,\n\n00:11:10.958 --> 00:11:13.958\nand I wouldn't be at all worried about that\n\n00:11:13.958 --> 00:11:16.958\nif we never had any contact with Asia.\n\n00:11:16.958 --> 00:11:20.958\nAnd HIV is actually particularly closely linked to transit.\n\n00:11:20.958 --> 00:11:22.958\nThe epidemic was introduced to the US\n\n00:11:22.958 --> 00:11:26.958\nby actually one male steward on an airline flight,\n\n00:11:26.958 --> 00:11:28.958\nwho got the disease in Africa and brought it back.\n\n00:11:28.958 --> 00:11:31.958\nAnd that was the genesis of the entire epidemic in the US.\n\n00:11:31.958 --> 00:11:35.958\nIn Africa, epidemiologists have noted for a long time\n\n00:11:35.958 --> 00:11:39.958\nthat truck drivers and migrants are more likely to be infected than other people.\n\n00:11:39.958 --> 00:11:41.958\nAreas with a lot of economic activity --\n\n00:11:41.958 --> 00:11:44.958\nwith a lot of roads, with a lot of urbanization --\n\n00:11:44.958 --> 00:11:46.958\nthose areas have higher prevalence than others.\n\n00:11:46.958 --> 00:11:48.958\nBut that actually doesn't mean at all\n\n00:11:48.958 --> 00:11:52.958\nthat if we gave people more exports, more trade, that that would increase prevalence.\n\n00:11:52.958 --> 00:11:56.958\nBy using this new data, using this information about prevalence over time,\n\n00:11:56.958 --> 00:12:00.958\nwe can actually test that. And so it seems to be --\n\n00:12:00.958 --> 00:12:02.958\nfortunately, I think -- it seems to be the case\n\n00:12:02.958 --> 00:12:04.958\nthat these things are positively related.\n\n00:12:04.958 --> 00:12:08.958\nMore exports means more AIDS. And that effect is really big.\n\n00:12:08.958 --> 00:12:12.958\nSo the data that I have suggests that if you double export volume,\n\n00:12:12.958 --> 00:12:17.958\nit will lead to a quadrupling of new HIV infections.\n\n00:12:17.958 --> 00:12:20.958\nSo this has important implications both for forecasting and for policy.\n\n00:12:20.958 --> 00:12:24.958\nFrom a forecasting perspective, if we know where trade is likely to change,\n\n00:12:24.958 --> 00:12:27.958\nfor example, because of the African Growth and Opportunities Act\n\n00:12:27.958 --> 00:12:29.958\nor other policies that encourage trade,\n\n00:12:29.958 --> 00:12:34.958\nwe can actually think about which areas are likely to be heavily infected with HIV.\n\n00:12:34.958 --> 00:12:40.958\nAnd we can go and we can try to have pre-emptive preventive measures there.\n\n00:12:40.958 --> 00:12:43.958\nLikewise, as we're developing policies to try to encourage exports,\n\n00:12:43.958 --> 00:12:45.958\nif we know there's this externality --\n\n00:12:45.958 --> 00:12:47.958\nthis extra thing that's going to happen as we increase exports --\n\n00:12:47.958 --> 00:12:50.958\nwe can think about what the right kinds of policies are.\n\n00:12:50.958 --> 00:12:53.958\nBut it also tells us something about one of these things that we think that we know.\n\n00:12:53.958 --> 00:12:56.958\nEven though it is the case that poverty is linked to AIDS,\n\n00:12:56.958 --> 00:12:59.958\nin the sense that Africa is poor and they have a lot of AIDS,\n\n00:12:59.958 --> 00:13:03.958\nit's not necessarily the case that improving poverty -- at least in the short run,\n\n00:13:03.958 --> 00:13:05.958\nthat improving exports and improving development --\n\n00:13:05.958 --> 00:13:07.958\nit's not necessarily the case that that's going to lead\n\n00:13:07.958 --> 00:13:09.958\nto a decline in HIV prevalence.\n\n00:13:10.958 --> 00:13:12.958\nSo throughout this talk I've mentioned a few times\n\n00:13:12.958 --> 00:13:14.958\nthe special case of Uganda, and the fact that\n\n00:13:14.958 --> 00:13:18.958\nit's the only country in sub-Saharan Africa with successful prevention.\n\n00:13:18.958 --> 00:13:20.958\nIt's been widely heralded.\n\n00:13:20.958 --> 00:13:26.958\nIt's been replicated in Kenya, and Tanzania, and South Africa and many other places.\n\n00:13:26.958 --> 00:13:30.958\nBut now I want to actually also question that.\n\n00:13:30.958 --> 00:13:33.958\nBecause it is true that there was a decline in prevalence\n\n00:13:33.958 --> 00:13:37.958\nin Uganda in the 1990s. It's true that they had an education campaign.\n\n00:13:37.958 --> 00:13:43.958\nBut there was actually something else that happened in Uganda in this period.\n\n00:13:43.958 --> 00:13:45.958\nThere was a big decline in coffee prices.\n\n00:13:45.958 --> 00:13:47.958\nCoffee is Uganda's major export.\n\n00:13:47.958 --> 00:13:52.958\nTheir exports went down a lot in the early 1990s -- and actually that decline lines up\n\n00:13:52.958 --> 00:13:56.958\nreally, really closely with this decline in new HIV infections.\n\n00:13:56.958 --> 00:13:59.958\nSo you can see that both of these series --\n\n00:13:59.958 --> 00:14:02.958\nthe black line is export value, the red line is new HIV infections --\n\n00:14:02.958 --> 00:14:04.958\nyou can see they're both increasing.\n\n00:14:04.958 --> 00:14:06.958\nStarting about 1987 they're both going down a lot.\n\n00:14:06.958 --> 00:14:08.958\nAnd then actually they track each other\n\n00:14:08.958 --> 00:14:10.958\na little bit on the increase later in the decade.\n\n00:14:10.958 --> 00:14:12.958\nSo if you combine the intuition in this figure\n\n00:14:12.958 --> 00:14:15.958\nwith some of the data that I talked about before,\n\n00:14:15.958 --> 00:14:19.958\nit suggests that somewhere between 25 percent and 50 percent\n\n00:14:19.958 --> 00:14:21.958\nof the decline in prevalence in Uganda\n\n00:14:21.958 --> 00:14:25.958\nactually would have happened even without any education campaign.\n\n00:14:25.958 --> 00:14:27.958\nBut that's enormously important for policy.\n\n00:14:27.958 --> 00:14:29.958\nWe're spending so much money to try to replicate this campaign.\n\n00:14:29.958 --> 00:14:32.958\nAnd if it was only 50 percent as effective as we think that it was,\n\n00:14:32.958 --> 00:14:34.958\nthen there are all sorts of other things\n\n00:14:34.958 --> 00:14:36.958\nmaybe we should be spending our money on instead.\n\n00:14:36.958 --> 00:14:40.958\nTrying to change transmission rates by treating other sexually transmitted diseases.\n\n00:14:40.958 --> 00:14:42.958\nTrying to change them by engaging in male circumcision.\n\n00:14:42.958 --> 00:14:44.958\nThere are tons of other things that we should think about doing.\n\n00:14:44.958 --> 00:14:48.958\nAnd maybe this tells us that we should be thinking more about those things.\n\n00:14:48.958 --> 00:14:53.958\nI hope that in the last 16 minutes I've told you something that you didn't know about AIDS,\n\n00:14:53.958 --> 00:14:55.958\nand I hope that I've gotten you questioning a little bit\n\n00:14:55.958 --> 00:14:57.958\nsome of the things that you did know.\n\n00:14:57.958 --> 00:14:59.958\nAnd I hope that I've convinced you maybe\n\n00:14:59.958 --> 00:15:01.958\nthat it's important to understand things about the epidemic\n\n00:15:01.958 --> 00:15:03.958\nin order to think about policy.\n\n00:15:04.958 --> 00:15:06.958\nBut more than anything, you know, I'm an academic.\n\n00:15:06.958 --> 00:15:08.958\nAnd when I leave here, I'm going to go back\n\n00:15:08.958 --> 00:15:11.958\nand sit in my tiny office, and my computer, and my data.\n\n00:15:11.958 --> 00:15:13.958\nAnd the thing that's most exciting about that\n\n00:15:13.958 --> 00:15:16.958\nis every time I think about research, there are more questions.\n\n00:15:16.958 --> 00:15:18.958\nThere are more things that I think that I want to do.\n\n00:15:18.958 --> 00:15:20.958\nAnd what's really, really great about being here\n\n00:15:20.958 --> 00:15:22.958\nis I'm sure that the questions that you guys have\n\n00:15:22.958 --> 00:15:25.958\nare very, very different than the questions that I think up myself.\n\n00:15:25.958 --> 00:15:27.958\nAnd I can't wait to hear about what they are.\n\n00:15:27.958 --> 00:15:29.958\nSo thank you very much."}, {"title": "Spore, birth of a game", "duration": "997", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/will_wright_makes_toys_that_make_worlds", "transcript": "I've always wanted to be a cyborg. One of my favorite shows as a kid was \"The Six Million Dollar Man,\" and this is a little bit closer to the 240-dollar man or so, but \u2014(Laughter)At any rate, I would normally feel very self-conscious and geeky wearing this around, but a few days ago I saw one world-renowned statistician swallowing swords on stage here, so I figure it's OK amongst this group. But that's not what I want to talk about today. I want to talk about toys, and the power that I see inherent in them.When I was a kid, I attended Montessori school up to sixth grade in Atlanta, Georgia. And at the time I didn't think much about it, but then later, I realized that that was the high point of my education. From that point on, everything else was pretty much downhill. And it wasn't until later, as I started making games, that \u2014 I really actually think of them more as toys. People call me a game designer, but I really think of these things more as toys. I started getting very interested in Maria Montessori and her methods, and the way she went about things, and the way she thought it very valuable for kids to discover things on their own rather than being taught these things overtly. And she would design these toys, where kids in playing with the toys would come to understand these deep principles of life and nature through play. And since they discovered this, it stuck with them so much more, and also they would experience their own failures. There was a failure-based aspect to learning there. It was very important. And so, the games that I do, I think of really more as modern Montessori toys. And I really kind of want them to be presented in a way to where kids can kind of explore and discover their own principles. So a few years ago,I started getting very interested in the SETI program. And that's the way I work. I get interested in different subjects, I dive in, research them, and then try to figure out how to craft a toy around that, so that other people can experience the same sense of discovery that I did as I was learning that subject. And it led me to astrobiology, the study of possible life in the universe. And then Drake's equation, looking at the probability of life arising on planets, how long it might last, how many planets are out there. And I started looking at how interesting Drake's equation was, because it spanned all these different subjects \u2014 physics, chemistry, sociology, economics, astronomy.And another thing that really impressed me a long time ago was \"Powers of Ten,\" Charles and Ray Eames' film. And I started putting those two together and wondering, could I build a toy where kids would trip across all these interesting principles of life, as it exists and as it might go in the future. Things where you might trip across things like the Copernican principle, the Fermi paradox, the anthropic principle, the origin of life.And so I'm going to show you a toy today that I've been working on, that I think of more as kind of a philosophy toy. Playing this toy will bring up philosophical questions in you.The game is \"Spore.\" I've been working on it for several years. It's getting pretty close to finished now. It occurs at all these different scales, from very small to very large. I'm going to pop in at the start of the game. And you actually start this game in a drop of water, as a very, very small single-cell creature, and right off the bat you basically just have to live, survive, reproduce. So here we are, at a very microscopic scale, swimming around. And I actually realize that cells don't have eyes, but it helps to make it cute.The players are going to play through every generation of this species, and as you play the game, the creature is actually growing bit by bit. And as we start growing, the camera will actually start zooming out, and things that you see in the background there will start slowly pulling into the foreground, showing you a little bit of what you'll be interacting with as you grow. So as we eat, the camera starts pulling out, and then we start interacting with larger and larger organisms.We actually play through many generations here, at the cellular scale. I'm going to skip ahead here. At some point we get larger, and we actually get to a macroevolution scale. Now, at this point we're leaving the water, and one thing that's kind of important about this game is that, at every level, the player is designing their creature, and that's a fundamental aspect of this.Now, in the evolution game here, the creature scale, basically you have to eat, survive, and then reproduce. You know, very Darwinian. One thing we noticed with \"The Sims,\" a game I did earlier, is that players love making stuff. When they were able to make stuff in the game, they had a lot of empathy in connection to it. Even if it wasn't as pretty as a professional artist would make for games, it really stuck with them and they really cared about what would happen to it.At this point, we've left the water, and now with this little creature \u2014 we could bring up the volume a little bit \u2014 and now we might try to eat. We might sneak up on this little guy over here maybe, and try and eat him. OK, well, we fight.(Creatures grunting)OK, we got him. Now we get a meal. So really, at this part of the game, what we're doing is we're running around and surviving, and also getting to the next generation, because we're going to play through every generation of this creature. We can mate, so I'm going to see if one of these creatures wants to mate with me. Yeah.(Creatures grunting)We didn't want to replay actual evolution with humans and all that, because it's almost more interesting to look at alternate possibilities in evolution. Evolution is usually presented as this one path that we took through, but really it represents this huge set of possibilities. Now, once we mate, we click on the egg. And this is where the game starts getting interesting, because one of the things we really focused on here was giving the players very high-leverage tools, so that for very little effort, the player can make something very cool. And it involves a lot of intelligence on the tool side.But basically, this is the editor where we're going to design the next generation. So it has a little spine. I can move around, I can extend. I can also inflate or deflate it with the mouse wheel, so you sculpt it like clay. We have parts here that I can put on or pull off. The idea is that the player can basically design anything they can think of in this editor, and we'll basically bring it to life. So I might put some limbs on the character here. I'll inflate them kind of large. And in this case I might decide I'm going to put \u2014 I'll put mouths on the limbs.So pretty much players are encouraged to be very creative in the game. Here, I'll give it one eye in the middle, maybe scale it up a bit. Point it down. And I'll also give it a few legs. So in some sense we want this to feel like an amplifier for the player's imagination, so that with a very small number of clicks a player can create something that they didn't really think was possible before. This is almost like designing something like Maya \u2014 that an eight-year-old can use. But really the goal here was, within about a minute, I wanted somebody to replicate what typically takes a pictorial artist several weeks to create. OK, now I'll put some hands on it. OK, so here I've basically thrown together a little creature. Let me give it a little weapon on the tail here, so it can fight. OK, so that's the complete model. Now we can actually go to the painting phase.At this phase, the program has some understanding of the topology of this creature. It knows where the backbone is, where the spine, the limbs are, how stripes should run, how it should be shaded. And so we're procedurally generating the texture map, something a texture artist would take many days to work on. And then we can test it out, and see how it would move around. And so at this point the computer is procedurally animating this creature. It's looking at whatever I've designed. It will actually bring it to life. And I can see how it might dance.(Laughter)How it might show emotions, how it might fight. So it's acting with its two mouths there. I can even have it pose for a photo. Snap a little photo of it.(Laughter)So then I bring this back into the game. It's born, and I play the next generation of my creature through evolution. Now again, the empathy that the players have when they create the content is tremendous. When players create content in this game, it's automatically sent up to a server and then redistributed to all the other players transparently. So in fact, as I'm interacting in this world with other creatures, these creatures are transparently coming from other players as they play. So the process of playing the game is a process of building up this huge database of content. And pretty much everything you're going to see in this game, there's an editor for that the player can create, up through civilization. This is my baby. When I eat, I'll actually start growing.This is the next generation. But I'm going to skip ahead here. Normally what would happen is these creatures would work their way up, eventually become intelligent. I'd start dealing with tribes, cities and civilizations of them over time. I'm going to skip way ahead to the space phase. Eventually they would go out into space, and start colonizing and exploring the universe. Now, really, in some sense, I want the players to be building this world in their imagination, and then extracting it from them with the least amount of pain.So that's kind of what these tools are about. How do we make the gameplay, you know, basically the player's imagination amplifier? And how do we make these tools, these editors, something that are just as fun as the game itself? So this is the planet that we've been playing on up to this point in the game. So far the entire game has been played on the surface of this little world here.At this point we're actually dealing with a very little toy planet. Almost, again, like the Montessori toy idea. What happens if you give somebody a toy planet, and let them play with a lot of dynamics on it? What could they discover? What might they learn on this? This world was actually extracted from the player's imagination. So, this is the planet that the player evolved on. Things like the buildings, the vehicles, the architecture, civilizations were all designed by the player up to this point. So here's a little city with some of our guys walking around in it. And most games put the player in the role of Luke Skywalker, this protagonist playing through this story. This is more about putting the player in the role of George Lucas. I want them, after they've played this game, to have extracted an entire world that they're now interacting with.As we pull down here, we still have a whole set of creatures living on the surface of the planet. All these different dynamics going on here. I can look over here, and this is a little simplified food web that's going on with the creatures. I can open this up and then scan what exists on the surface.You get some sense of the diversity of creatures that were brought in. Some of these were created by the player, others by other players, automatically sent over here. But there's a very simple calculation of what's required, how many plants are required for the herbivores to live, how many herbivores for the carnivores to eat, etc., that you have to balance actively. Also with this phase, we're getting more and more God-like powers for the player, and you can experiment with this planet as a toy. So I can come in and I can do things, and just treat this planet as a lump of clay. We have very simple weather systems, simple geology. For instance, I could open one of my tools here and then carve out rivers. So this whole thing is kind of like a big lump of clay, a sculpture. I can also play with the dynamics in this world over time.So one of the things I can do is start pumping more CO2 gases into the atmosphere, and so that's what I'm doing here. There's actually a little readout down there of our planetary atmosphere, pressure and temperature. So as I start pumping in more atmosphere, we're going to start pushing up the greenhouse gases here and if you'll start noticing, we start seeing the ocean levels rise over time. And our cities are going to be at risk too, because a lot of these are coastal cities. You can see the ocean levels are rising now and as they encroach upon the cities, I'll start losing cities here.So basically, I want the players to be able to experiment and explore a huge amount of failure space. So there goes one city. Now, over time, this is going to heat up the planet. So at first what we're going to see is a global ocean rise here on this little toy planet, but then over time \u2014 I can speed it up \u2014 we'll see the heat impact of that as well.Not only will it get hotter, but at some point it's going to get so hot the oceans will evaporate. They'll go up, and then they'll evaporate, and that'll be my planet. So basically, what we're getting here is the sequel to \"An Inconvenient Truth,\" in about two minutes, and that actually brings up an interesting point about games. Now here, our entire oceans are evaporating off the surface, and as it keeps getting hotter, at some point the entire planet is going to melt down. Here it goes.So we're not only simulating biological dynamics \u2014 food webs and all that \u2014 but also geologic, you know, on a very simple core scale. And what's interesting to me about games is that I think we can take a lot of long-term dynamics and compress them into very short-term experiences. Because it's so hard for people to think 50 or 100 years out, but when you can give them a toy, and they can experience these long-term dynamics in just a few minutes, I think it's an entirely different point of view, where we're actually using the game to remap our intuition. It's almost in the same way that a telescope or microscope recalibrates your eyesight; I think computer simulations can recalibrate your instinct across vast scales of both space and time.So here's our little solar system, as we pull away from our melted planet here. We actually have a couple of other planets in this solar system. Let's fly to another one. We're going to have this unlimited number of worlds you can explore here. As we move into the future, and we start going out into space and doing stuff, we're drawing a lot from things like science fiction. And all my favorite science fiction movies I want to play out here as different dynamics.This planet actually has some life on it. Here it is, some indigenous life down here. One of the tools I can eventually earn for my UFO is a monolith that I can drop down.(Laughter)Now, as you can see, these guys are actually starting to go up and bow to it, and over time, once they touch it, they will become intelligent. So I can actually pick a species on a planet and then make them sentient. Now they've actually gone to tribal dynamics. And now, because I'm actually the one here, I can get out of the UFO and walk up, and they should be worshipping me at this point as a god. At first they're a little freaked out. OK, well maybe they're not worshipping me.(Laughter)I think I'll leave before they get hostile.But we basically want a diversity of activities the players can play through this. I want to be able to play \"The Day the Earth Stood Still,\" \"2001: A Space Odyssey,\" \"Star Trek,\" \"War Of the Worlds.\" Now, as we pull away from this world \u2014 we're going to keep pulling away from the star now. One of the things that always frustrated me about astronomy when I was a kid is how it was always presented so two-dimensionally and so static. As we pull away from the star here, we're actually going now out into interstellar space, and we're getting a sense of the space around our home star.What I really wanted to do is to present this, basically, as wonderfully 3D as it is actually is. And also show the dynamics, and a lot of the interesting objects that you might find, like, in the Hubble, at pretty much realistic frequencies and scales. So most people have no idea of the difference between an emission nebula and a planetary nebula. But these are the things that we can put in this little galaxy here. So we're flying over here to what looks like a black hole. I want to basically have the entire zoo of Hubble objects that people can interact with and play with, again, as toys.So here's a little black hole that we probably don't want to get too close to. But we also have stars and things as well. If we pull all the way back, we start seeing the entire galaxy here, kind of slowly in motion. Typically, when people present galaxies, it's always beautiful photos, but they're always static. And when you bring it forward in time and start animating it, it's amazing what a galaxy would look like fast forwarded.This would be about a million years a second, because you have about one supernova every century. And so you'd have this wonderful sparkling thing, with the disk slowly rotating, and this is roughly what it would look like. Part of this is about bringing the beauty of the natural world to somebody in a very imaginative way, so that they can start calibrating their instinct across these vast scales of space and time.Chris was wondering what kind of gods the players would become. Because if you think about it, you're going to have 15-year-olds, 20-year-olds flying around this universe. They might be a nurturing god. They might be bootstrapping life on planets, trying to terraform and spread civilization. You might be a vengeful god, conquesting, because you actually can do that, you can attack other intelligent races. You might be a networking god, building alliances, or just curious, going around and wanting to explore as much as you possibly can.But basically, the reason why I make toys like this is because I think if there's one difference I could possibly make in the world, that I would choose to make, it's that I would like to somehow give people just a little bit better calibration on long-term thinking. Because I think most of the problems that our world is facing right now are the result of short-term thinking, and the fact that it is so hard for us to think 50, 100, or 1,000 years out. And I think by giving kids toys like this and letting them replay dynamics, very long-term dynamics over the short term, and getting some sense of what we're doing now, what it's going to be like in 100 years, I think probably is the most effective thing I can be doing to help the world. And so that's why I think that toys can change the world.Thank you.", "id": 146, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:12.558 --> 00:00:14.214\nI've always wanted to be a cyborg.\n\n00:00:14.238 --> 00:00:17.414\nOne of my favorite shows as a kid\nwas \"The Six Million Dollar Man,\"\n\n00:00:17.438 --> 00:00:20.614\nand this is a little bit closer\nto the 240-dollar man or so, but --\n\n00:00:20.638 --> 00:00:21.934\n(Laughter)\n\n00:00:21.958 --> 00:00:25.374\nAt any rate, I would normally\nfeel very self-conscious and geeky\n\n00:00:25.398 --> 00:00:26.614\nwearing this around,\n\n00:00:26.638 --> 00:00:29.974\nbut a few days ago\nI saw one world-renowned statistician\n\n00:00:29.998 --> 00:00:31.574\nswallowing swords on stage here,\n\n00:00:31.598 --> 00:00:34.558\nso I figure it's OK amongst this group.\n\n00:00:35.238 --> 00:00:37.454\nBut that's not what I want\nto talk about today.\n\n00:00:37.478 --> 00:00:41.374\nI want to talk about toys,\nand the power that I see inherent in them.\n\n00:00:41.398 --> 00:00:43.574\nWhen I was a kid,\nI attended Montessori school\n\n00:00:43.598 --> 00:00:45.974\nup to sixth grade in Atlanta, Georgia.\n\n00:00:45.998 --> 00:00:48.134\nAnd at the time\nI didn't think much about it,\n\n00:00:48.158 --> 00:00:51.574\nbut then later, I realized that that was\nthe high point of my education.\n\n00:00:51.598 --> 00:00:54.854\nFrom that point on, everything else\nwas pretty much downhill.\n\n00:00:54.878 --> 00:00:57.814\nAnd it wasn't until later,\nas I started making games, that --\n\n00:00:57.838 --> 00:00:59.974\nI really actually\nthink of them more as toys.\n\n00:00:59.998 --> 00:01:01.534\nPeople call me a game designer,\n\n00:01:01.558 --> 00:01:03.814\nbut I really think\nof these things more as toys.\n\n00:01:03.838 --> 00:01:07.194\nI started getting very interested\nin Maria Montessori and her methods,\n\n00:01:07.218 --> 00:01:08.874\nand the way she went about things,\n\n00:01:08.898 --> 00:01:11.234\nand the way she thought it\nvery valuable for kids\n\n00:01:11.258 --> 00:01:12.794\nto discover things on their own\n\n00:01:12.818 --> 00:01:14.994\nrather than being taught\nthese things overtly.\n\n00:01:15.018 --> 00:01:18.254\nAnd she would design these toys,\nwhere kids in playing with the toys\n\n00:01:18.278 --> 00:01:20.454\nwould come to understand\nthese deep principles\n\n00:01:20.478 --> 00:01:22.054\nof life and nature through play.\n\n00:01:22.078 --> 00:01:25.094\nAnd since they discovered this,\nit stuck with them so much more,\n\n00:01:25.118 --> 00:01:27.494\nand also they would experience\ntheir own failures.\n\n00:01:27.518 --> 00:01:31.014\nThere was a failure-based aspect\nto learning there.

--> 00:01:48.816\nI get interested in different subjects,\nI dive in, research them,\n\n00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:51.597\nand then try to figure out\nhow to craft a toy around that,\n\n00:01:51.621 -->

started looking\nat how interesting Drake's equation was,\n\n00:02:09.771 --> 00:02:12.148\nbecause it spanned\nall these different subjects --\n\n00:02:12.172 --> 00:02:16.094\nphysics,

00:02:41.134\nAnd so I'm going to show you a toy today\nthat I've been working on,\n\n00:02:41.158 --> 00:02:44.094\nthat I think of more\nas kind of a philosophy toy.\n\n00:02:44.118 --> 00:02:47.494\nPlaying this toy will bring up\nphilosophical questions in you.\n\n00:02:47.518 --> 00:02:50.574\nThe game is \"Spore.\"\nI've been working on it for several years.\n\n00:02:50.598 --> 00:02:52.614\nIt's getting pretty close to finished now.\n\n00:02:52.638 --> 00:02:56.015\nIt occurs at all these different scales,\nfrom very small to very large.\n\n00:02:56.039 --> 00:02:58.176\nI'm going to pop in\nat the start of the game.\n\n00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:00.657\nAnd you actually start this game\nin a drop of water,\n\n00:03:00.681 --> 00:03:02.698\nas a very, very small\nsingle-cell creature,\n\n00:03:02.722 --> 00:03:06.755\nand right off the bat you basically\njust have to live, survive, reproduce.\n\n00:03:06.779 --> 00:03:09.734\nSo here we are,\nat a very microscopic scale,\n\n00:03:09.758 --> 00:03:11.214\nswimming around.\n\n00:03:11.238 --> 00:03:13.614\nAnd I actually realize\nthat cells don't have eyes,\n\n00:03:13.638 --> 00:03:15.934\nbut it helps to make it cute.\n\n00:03:15.958 --> 00:03:19.814\nThe players are going to play\nthrough every generation of this species,\n\n00:03:19.838 --> 00:03:21.094\nand as you play the game,\n\n00:03:21.118 --> 00:03:23.214\nthe creature is actually\ngrowing bit by bit.\n\n00:03:23.238 --> 00:03:24.814\nAnd as we start growing,\n\n00:03:24.838 --> 00:03:26.894\nthe camera will\nactually start zooming out,\n\n00:03:26.918 --> 00:03:29.134\nand things that you see\nin the background there\n\n00:03:29.158 --> 00:03:31.334\nwill start slowly\npulling into the foreground,\n\n00:03:31.358 --> 00:03:34.774\nshowing you a little bit of what\nyou'll be interacting with as you grow.\n\n00:03:34.798 --> 00:03:36.934\nSo as we eat, the camera\nstarts pulling out,\n\n00:03:36.958 --> 00:03:39.934\nand then we start interacting\nwith larger and larger organisms.\n\n00:03:39.958 --> 00:03:42.174\nWe actually play\nthrough many generations here,\n\n00:03:42.198 --> 00:03:43.414\nat the cellular scale.\n\n00:03:43.438 --> 00:03:44.854\nI'm going to skip ahead here.\n\n00:03:44.878 --> 00:03:46.254\nAt some point we get larger,\n\n00:03:46.278 --> 00:03:49.243\nand we actually get\nto a macroevolution scale.\n\n00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:52.934\nNow, at this point\nwe're leaving the water,\n\n00:03:52.958 --> 00:03:56.694\nand one thing that's kind of important\nabout this game is that, at every level,\n\n00:03:56.718 --> 00:03:58.974\nthe player is designing their creature,\n\n00:03:58.998 --> 00:04:00.934\nand that's a fundamental aspect of this.\n\n00:04:00.958 --> 00:04:03.934\nNow, in the evolution game here,\nthe creature scale,\n\n00:04:03.958 --> 00:04:06.534\nbasically you have to eat,\nsurvive, and then reproduce.\n\n00:04:06.558 --> 00:04:08.374\nYou know, very Darwinian.\n\n00:04:08.398 --> 00:04:11.374\nOne thing we noticed with \"The Sims,\"\na game I did earlier,\n\n00:04:11.398 --> 00:04:13.054\nis that players love making stuff.\n\n00:04:13.078 --> 00:04:15.254\nWhen they were able\nto make stuff in the game,\n\n00:04:15.278 --> 00:04:17.495\nthey had a lot of empathy\nin connection to it.\n\n00:04:17.519 --> 00:04:19.195\nEven if it wasn't as pretty\n\n00:04:19.219 --> 00:04:21.910\nas a professional artist\nwould make for games,\n\n00:04:21.934 --> 00:04:23.151\nit really stuck with them\n\n00:04:23.175 --> 00:04:25.632\nand they really cared\nabout what would happen to it.\n\n00:04:25.656 --> 00:04:29.086\nAt this point, we've left the water,\nand now with this little creature --\n\n00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:31.180\nwe could bring up\nthe volume a little bit --\n\n00:04:31.204 --> 00:04:33.140\nand now we might try to eat.\n\n00:04:33.772 --> 00:04:36.257\nWe might sneak up\non this little guy over here maybe,\n\n00:04:38.038 --> 00:04:39.238\nand try and eat him.\n\n00:04:40.118 --> 00:04:41.334\nOK, well, we fight.\n\n00:04:41.358 --> 00:04:42.758\n(Creatures grunting)\n\n00:04:44.718 --> 00:04:45.918\nOK, we got him.\n\n00:04:47.238 --> 00:04:48.438\nNow we get a meal.\n\n00:04:50.302 --> 00:04:52.054\nSo really, at this part of the game,\n\n00:04:52.078 --> 00:04:54.694\nwhat we're doing is we're\nrunning around and surviving,\n\n00:04:54.718 --> 00:04:56.654\nand also getting to the next generation,\n\n00:04:56.678 --> 00:04:59.974\nbecause we're going to play\nthrough every generation of this creature.\n\n00:04:59.998 --> 00:05:01.574\nWe can mate, so I'm going to see\n\n00:05:01.598 --> 00:05:04.158\nif one of these creatures\nwants to mate with me. Yeah.\n\n00:05:08.594 --> 00:05:10.614\n(Creatures grunting)\n\n00:05:10.638 --> 00:05:14.454\nWe didn't want to replay\nactual evolution with humans and all that,\n\n00:05:14.478 --> 00:05:16.214\nbecause it's almost more interesting\n\n00:05:16.238 --> 00:05:18.494\nto look at alternate\npossibilities in evolution.\n\n00:05:18.518 --> 00:05:21.774\nEvolution is usually presented\nas this one path that we took through,\n\n00:05:21.798 --> 00:05:24.454\nbut really it represents\nthis huge set of possibilities.\n\n00:05:24.478 --> 00:05:26.374\nNow, once we mate, we click on the egg.\n\n00:05:26.398 --> 00:05:28.934\nAnd this is where the game\nstarts getting interesting,\n\n00:05:28.958 --> 00:05:31.374\nbecause one of the things\nwe really focused on here\n\n00:05:31.398 --> 00:05:33.654\nwas giving the players\nvery high-leverage tools,\n\n00:05:33.678 --> 00:05:37.254\nso that for very little effort,\nthe player can make something very cool.\n\n00:05:37.278 --> 00:05:39.934\nAnd it involves a lot\nof intelligence on the tool side.\n\n00:05:39.958 --> 00:05:41.534\nBut basically, this is the editor\n\n00:05:41.558 --> 00:05:43.836\nwhere we're going to design\nthe next generation.\n\n00:05:43.860 --> 00:05:46.894\nSo it has a little spine.\nI can move around, I can extend.\n\n00:05:46.918 --> 00:05:49.454\nI can also inflate or deflate it\nwith the mouse wheel,\n\n00:05:49.478 --> 00:05:50.814\nso you sculpt it like clay.\n\n00:05:50.838 --> 00:05:53.174\nWe have parts here\nthat I can put on or pull off.\n\n00:05:53.198 --> 00:05:55.454\nThe idea is that the player\ncan basically design\n\n00:05:55.478 --> 00:05:57.494\nanything they can think of in this editor,\n\n00:05:57.518 --> 00:05:59.334\nand we'll basically bring it to life.\n\n00:05:59.358 --> 00:06:01.614\nSo I might put some limbs\non the character here.\n\n00:06:01.638 --> 00:06:03.214\nI'll inflate them kind of large.\n\n00:06:03.238 --> 00:06:06.198\nAnd in this case\nI might decide I'm going to put --\n\n00:06:07.878 --> 00:06:09.598\nI'll put mouths on the limbs.\n\n00:06:12.838 --> 00:06:17.054\nSo pretty much players are encouraged\nto be very creative in the game.\n\n00:06:17.078 --> 00:06:21.374\nHere, I'll give it one eye in the middle,\nmaybe scale it up a bit. Point it down.\n\n00:06:21.398 --> 00:06:23.078\nAnd I'll also give it a few legs.\n\n00:06:26.078 --> 00:06:27.294\nSo in some sense\n\n00:06:27.318 --> 00:06:30.734\nwe want this to feel like an amplifier\nfor the player's imagination,\n\n00:06:30.758 --> 00:06:34.494\nso that with a very small number of clicks\na player can create something\n\n00:06:34.518 --> 00:06:36.894\nthat they didn't really think\nwas possible before.\n\n00:06:36.918 --> 00:06:39.374\nThis is almost like designing\nsomething like Maya --\n\n00:06:39.398 --> 00:06:40.894\nthat an eight-year-old can use.\n\n00:06:40.918 --> 00:06:42.334\nBut really the goal here was,\n\n00:06:42.358 --> 00:06:44.854\nwithin about a minute,\nI wanted somebody to replicate\n\n00:06:44.878 --> 00:06:48.134\nwhat typically takes a pictorial artist\nseveral weeks to create.\n\n00:06:48.158 --> 00:06:50.094\nOK, now I'll put some hands on it.\n\n00:06:50.118 --> 00:06:53.014\nOK, so here I've basically\nthrown together a little creature.\n\n00:06:53.038 --> 00:06:56.118\nLet me give it a little weapon\non the tail here, so it can fight.\n\n00:06:56.838 --> 00:06:58.454\nOK, so that's the complete model.\n\n00:06:58.478 --> 00:07:00.614\nNow we can actually\ngo to the painting phase.\n\n00:07:00.638 --> 00:07:03.134\nAt this phase, the program\nhas some understanding\n\n00:07:03.158 --> 00:07:04.774\nof the topology of this creature.\n\n00:07:04.798 --> 00:07:07.834\nIt knows where the backbone is,\nwhere the spine, the limbs are,\n\n00:07:07.858 --> 00:07:10.114\nhow stripes should run,\nhow it should be shaded.\n\n00:07:10.138 --> 00:07:12.634\nAnd so we're procedurally\ngenerating the texture map,\n\n00:07:12.658 --> 00:07:15.534\nsomething a texture artist\nwould take many days to work on.\n\n00:07:15.558 --> 00:07:18.494\nAnd then we can test it out,\nand see how it would move around.\n\n00:07:18.518 --> 00:07:22.014\nAnd so at this point the computer\nis procedurally animating this creature.\n\n00:07:22.038 --> 00:07:25.534\nIt's looking at whatever I've designed.\nIt will actually bring it to life.\n\n00:07:25.558 --> 00:07:27.134\nAnd I can see how it might dance.\n\n00:07:27.158 --> 00:07:28.374\n(Laughter)\n\n00:07:28.398 --> 00:07:30.758\nHow it might show emotions,\nhow it might fight.\n\n00:07:32.598 --> 00:07:34.574\nSo it's acting with its two mouths there.\n\n00:07:34.598 --> 00:07:36.454\nI can even have it pose for a photo.\n\n00:07:36.478 --> 00:07:37.934\nSnap a little photo of it.\n\n00:07:37.958 --> 00:07:39.934\n(Laughter)\n\n00:07:39.958 --> 00:07:41.974\nSo then I bring this back into the game.\n\n00:07:41.998 --> 00:07:45.534\nIt's born, and I play the next generation\nof my creature through evolution.\n\n00:07:45.558 --> 00:07:48.014\nNow again, the empathy\nthat the players have\n\n00:07:48.038 --> 00:07:50.054\nwhen they create\nthe content is tremendous.\n\n00:07:50.078 --> 00:07:53.854\nWhen players create content in this game,\nit's automatically sent up to a server\n\n00:07:53.878 --> 00:07:56.814\nand then redistributed\nto all the other players transparently.\n\n00:07:56.838 --> 00:07:59.974\nSo in fact, as I'm interacting\nin this world with other creatures,\n\n00:07:59.998 --> 00:08:03.894\nthese creatures are transparently\ncoming from other players as they play.\n\n00:08:03.918 --> 00:08:05.574\nSo the process of playing the game\n\n00:08:05.598 --> 00:08:08.454\nis a process of building up\nthis huge database of content.\n\n00:08:08.478 --> 00:08:11.334\nAnd pretty much everything\nyou're going to see in this game,\n\n00:08:11.358 --> 00:08:14.014\nthere's an editor for\nthat the player can create,\n\n00:08:14.038 --> 00:08:15.637\nup through civilization.\n\n00:08:15.661 --> 00:08:18.354\nThis is my baby. When I eat,\nI'll actually start growing.\n\n00:08:18.378 --> 00:08:21.414\nThis is the next generation.\nBut I'm going to skip ahead here.\n\n00:08:21.438 --> 00:08:24.774\nNormally what would happen is\nthese creatures would work their way up,\n\n00:08:24.798 --> 00:08:26.254\neventually become intelligent.\n\n00:08:26.278 --> 00:08:29.774\nI'd start dealing with tribes, cities\nand civilizations of them over time.\n\n00:08:29.798 --> 00:08:32.014\nI'm going to skip way ahead\nto the space phase.\n\n00:08:32.038 --> 00:08:33.974\nEventually they would go out into space,\n\n00:08:33.998 --> 00:08:37.614\nand start colonizing\nand exploring the universe.\n\n00:08:37.638 --> 00:08:39.316\nNow, really, in some sense,\n\n00:08:39.340 --> 00:08:42.614\nI want the players to be building\nthis world in their imagination,\n\n00:08:42.638 --> 00:08:45.654\nand then extracting it from them\nwith the least amount of pain.\n\n00:08:45.678 --> 00:08:47.814\nSo that's kind of\nwhat these tools are about.\n\n00:08:47.838 --> 00:08:50.093\nHow do we make the gameplay,\n\n00:08:50.117 --> 00:08:53.294\nyou know, basically\nthe player's imagination amplifier?\n\n00:08:53.318 --> 00:08:56.024\nAnd how do we make\nthese tools, these editors,\n\n00:08:56.048 --> 00:08:59.054\nsomething that are just as fun\nas the game itself?\n\n00:08:59.078 --> 00:09:01.334\nSo this is the planet\nthat we've been playing on\n\n00:09:01.358 --> 00:09:03.014\nup to this point in the game.\n\n00:09:03.038 --> 00:09:06.814\nSo far the entire game has been played\non the surface of this little world here.\n\n00:09:06.838 --> 00:09:10.014\nAt this point we're actually\ndealing with a very little toy planet.\n\n00:09:10.038 --> 00:09:12.134\nAlmost, again,\nlike the Montessori toy idea.\n\n00:09:12.158 --> 00:09:14.374\nWhat happens if you give\nsomebody a toy planet,\n\n00:09:14.398 --> 00:09:16.614\nand let them play\nwith a lot of dynamics on it?\n\n00:09:16.638 --> 00:09:19.294\nWhat could they discover?\nWhat might they learn on this?\n\n00:09:19.318 --> 00:09:22.334\nThis world was actually extracted\nfrom the player's imagination.\n\n00:09:22.358 --> 00:09:24.734\nSo, this is the planet\nthat the player evolved on.\n\n00:09:24.758 --> 00:09:28.174\nThings like the buildings, the vehicles,\nthe architecture, civilizations\n\n00:09:28.198 --> 00:09:30.534\nwere all designed by the player\nup to this point.\n\n00:09:30.558 --> 00:09:33.734\nSo here's a little city with some\nof our guys walking around in it.\n\n00:09:33.758 --> 00:09:36.614\nAnd most games put the player\nin the role of Luke Skywalker,\n\n00:09:36.638 --> 00:09:38.734\nthis protagonist\nplaying through this story.\n\n00:09:38.758 --> 00:09:41.894\nThis is more about putting the player\nin the role of George Lucas.\n\n00:09:41.918 --> 00:09:44.014\nI want them, after they've\nplayed this game,\n\n00:09:44.038 --> 00:09:47.254\nto have extracted an entire world\nthat they're now interacting with.\n\n00:09:47.278 --> 00:09:48.494\nAs we pull down here,\n\n00:09:48.518 --> 00:09:52.054\nwe still have a whole set of creatures\nliving on the surface of the planet.\n\n00:09:52.078 --> 00:09:54.094\nAll these different\ndynamics going on here.\n\n00:09:54.118 --> 00:09:57.054\nI can look over here, and this is\na little simplified food web\n\n00:09:57.078 --> 00:09:58.774\nthat's going on with the creatures.\n\n00:09:58.798 --> 00:10:01.654\nI can open this up and then scan\nwhat exists on the surface.\n\n00:10:01.678 --> 00:10:05.034\nYou get some sense of the diversity\nof creatures that were brought in.\n\n00:10:05.058 --> 00:10:07.034\nSome of these were created by the player,\n\n00:10:07.058 --> 00:10:09.654\nothers by other players,\nautomatically sent over here.\n\n00:10:09.678 --> 00:10:12.394\nBut there's a very simple\ncalculation of what's required,\n\n00:10:12.418 --> 00:10:15.074\nhow many plants are required\nfor the herbivores to live,\n\n00:10:15.098 --> 00:10:17.554\nhow many herbivores\nfor the carnivores to eat, etc.,\n\n00:10:17.578 --> 00:10:19.234\nthat you have to balance actively.\n\n00:10:19.258 --> 00:10:20.474\nAlso with this phase,\n\n00:10:20.498 --> 00:10:23.274\nwe're getting more and more\nGod-like powers for the player,\n\n00:10:23.298 --> 00:10:25.614\nand you can experiment\nwith this planet as a toy.\n\n00:10:25.638 --> 00:10:27.414\nSo I can come in and I can do things,\n\n00:10:27.438 --> 00:10:29.534\nand just treat this planet\nas a lump of clay.\n\n00:10:29.558 --> 00:10:32.015\nWe have very simple\nweather systems, simple geology.\n\n00:10:32.039 --> 00:10:35.516\nFor instance, I could open one of my tools\nhere and then carve out rivers.\n\n00:10:36.878 --> 00:10:40.094\nSo this whole thing is kind of\nlike a big lump of clay, a sculpture.\n\n00:10:40.118 --> 00:10:42.854\nI can also play with the dynamics\nin this world over time.\n\n00:10:42.878 --> 00:10:44.294\nSo one of the things I can do\n\n00:10:44.318 --> 00:10:47.694\nis start pumping more CO2 gases\ninto the atmosphere,\n\n00:10:47.718 --> 00:10:49.374\nand so that's what I'm doing here.\n\n00:10:49.398 --> 00:10:51.494\nThere's actually\na little readout down there\n\n00:10:51.518 --> 00:10:54.318\nof our planetary atmosphere,\npressure and temperature.\n\n00:10:54.838 --> 00:10:56.814\nSo as I start pumping in more atmosphere,\n\n00:10:56.838 --> 00:10:59.534\nwe're going to start pushing up\nthe greenhouse gases here\n\n00:10:59.558 --> 00:11:00.974\nand if you'll start noticing,\n\n00:11:00.998 --> 00:11:03.404\nwe start seeing\nthe ocean levels rise over time.\n\n00:11:03.838 --> 00:11:05.894\nAnd our cities\nare going to be at risk too,\n\n00:11:05.918 --> 00:11:07.934\nbecause a lot of these are coastal cities.\n\n00:11:07.958 --> 00:11:09.974\nYou can see the ocean levels\nare rising now\n\n00:11:09.998 --> 00:11:13.274\nand as they encroach upon the cities,\nI'll start losing cities here.\n\n00:11:13.298 --> 00:11:16.554\nSo basically, I want the players\nto be able to experiment and explore\n\n00:11:16.578 --> 00:11:18.114\na huge amount of failure space.\n\n00:11:18.138 --> 00:11:19.578\nSo there goes one city.\n\n00:11:20.425 --> 00:11:22.854\nNow, over time, this is\ngoing to heat up the planet.\n\n00:11:22.878 --> 00:11:24.574\nSo at first what we're going to see\n\n00:11:24.598 --> 00:11:27.134\nis a global ocean rise\nhere on this little toy planet,\n\n00:11:27.158 --> 00:11:29.175\nbut then over time --\nI can speed it up --\n\n00:11:29.199 --> 00:11:31.296\nwe'll see the heat impact of that as well.\n\n00:11:31.320 --> 00:11:33.223\nNot only will it get hotter,\n\n00:11:33.247 --> 00:11:36.564\nbut at some point it's going to get so hot\nthe oceans will evaporate.\n\n00:11:36.588 --> 00:11:39.905\nThey'll go up, and then they'll evaporate,\nand that'll be my planet.\n\n00:11:39.929 --> 00:11:41.706\nSo basically, what we're getting here\n\n00:11:41.730 --> 00:11:44.707\nis the sequel to \"An Inconvenient Truth,\"\nin about two minutes,\n\n00:11:44.731 --> 00:11:47.868\nand that actually brings up\nan interesting point about games.\n\n00:11:47.892 --> 00:11:51.052\nNow here, our entire oceans\nare evaporating off the surface,\n\n00:11:52.078 --> 00:11:53.614\nand as it keeps getting hotter,\n\n00:11:53.638 --> 00:11:57.174\nat some point the entire planet\nis going to melt down. Here it goes.\n\n00:11:57.198 --> 00:11:59.614\nSo we're not only\nsimulating biological dynamics --\n\n00:11:59.638 --> 00:12:00.854\nfood webs and all that --\n\n00:12:00.878 --> 00:12:03.574\nbut also geologic, you know,\non a very simple core scale.\n\n00:12:03.598 --> 00:12:05.503\nAnd what's interesting to me about games\n\n00:12:05.527 --> 00:12:08.134\nis that I think we can take\na lot of long-term dynamics\n\n00:12:08.158 --> 00:12:11.174\nand compress them\ninto very short-term experiences.\n\n00:12:11.198 --> 00:12:14.094\nBecause it's so hard for people\nto think 50 or 100 years out,\n\n00:12:14.118 --> 00:12:15.734\nbut when you can give them a toy,\n\n00:12:15.758 --> 00:12:19.094\nand they can experience these\nlong-term dynamics in just a few minutes,\n\n00:12:19.118 --> 00:12:21.454\nI think it's an entirely\ndifferent point of view,\n\n00:12:21.478 --> 00:12:24.254\nwhere we're actually using the game\nto remap our intuition.\n\n00:12:24.278 --> 00:12:25.614\nIt's almost in the same way\n\n00:12:25.638 --> 00:12:28.374\nthat a telescope or microscope\nrecalibrates your eyesight;\n\n00:12:28.398 --> 00:12:31.134\nI think computer simulations\ncan recalibrate your instinct\n\n00:12:31.158 --> 00:12:33.158\nacross vast scales of both space and time.\n\n00:12:33.182 --> 00:12:34.814\nSo here's our little solar system,\n\n00:12:34.838 --> 00:12:36.934\nas we pull away\nfrom our melted planet here.\n\n00:12:36.958 --> 00:12:40.014\nWe actually have a couple\nof other planets in this solar system.\n\n00:12:40.038 --> 00:12:41.254\nLet's fly to another one.\n\n00:12:41.278 --> 00:12:44.734\nWe're going to have this unlimited\nnumber of worlds you can explore here.\n\n00:12:44.758 --> 00:12:46.094\nAs we move into the future,\n\n00:12:46.118 --> 00:12:48.494\nand we start going out\ninto space and doing stuff,\n\n00:12:48.518 --> 00:12:51.014\nwe're drawing a lot\nfrom things like science fiction.\n\n00:12:51.038 --> 00:12:53.054\nAnd all my favorite science fiction movies\n\n00:12:53.078 --> 00:12:55.254\nI want to play out here\nas different dynamics.\n\n00:12:55.278 --> 00:12:57.254\nThis planet actually has some life on it.\n\n00:12:57.278 --> 00:12:59.294\nHere it is, some indigenous\nlife down here.\n\n00:12:59.318 --> 00:13:01.654\nOne of the tools\nI can eventually earn for my UFO\n\n00:13:01.678 --> 00:13:03.374\nis a monolith that I can drop down.\n\n00:13:03.398 --> 00:13:05.038\n(Laughter)\n\n00:13:05.918 --> 00:13:07.934\nNow, as you can see,\n\n00:13:07.958 --> 00:13:11.254\nthese guys are actually\nstarting to go up and bow to it,\n\n00:13:11.278 --> 00:13:14.294\nand over time, once they touch it,\nthey will become intelligent.\n\n00:13:14.318 --> 00:13:16.414\nSo I can actually\npick a species on a planet\n\n00:13:16.438 --> 00:13:17.814\nand then make them sentient.\n\n00:13:17.838 --> 00:13:19.974\nNow they've actually\ngone to tribal dynamics.\n\n00:13:19.998 --> 00:13:22.014\nAnd now, because\nI'm actually the one here,\n\n00:13:22.038 --> 00:13:23.854\nI can get out of the UFO and walk up,\n\n00:13:23.878 --> 00:13:26.974\nand they should be worshipping me\nat this point as a god.\n\n00:13:26.998 --> 00:13:28.958\nAt first they're a little freaked out.\n\n00:13:33.494 --> 00:13:35.494\nOK, well maybe they're not worshipping me.\n\n00:13:35.518 --> 00:13:36.534\n(Laughter)\n\n00:13:36.558 --> 00:13:38.678\nI think I'll leave\nbefore they get hostile.\n\n00:13:39.678 --> 00:13:41.894\nBut we basically want\na diversity of activities\n\n00:13:41.918 --> 00:13:43.574\nthe players can play through this.\n\n00:13:43.598 --> 00:13:44.854\nI want to be able to play\n\n00:13:44.878 --> 00:13:47.574\n\"The Day the Earth Stood Still,\"\n\"2001: A Space Odyssey,\"\n\n00:13:47.598 --> 00:13:49.214\n\"Star Trek,\" \"War Of the Worlds.\"\n\n00:13:49.238 --> 00:13:51.214\nNow, as we pull away from this world --\n\n00:13:51.238 --> 00:13:53.654\nwe're going to keep\npulling away from the star now.\n\n00:13:53.678 --> 00:13:56.494\nOne of the things that always\nfrustrated me about astronomy\n\n00:13:56.518 --> 00:13:57.734\nwhen I was a kid\n\n00:13:57.758 --> 00:14:00.894\nis how it was always presented\nso two-dimensionally and so static.\n\n00:14:00.918 --> 00:14:02.614\nAs we pull away from the star here,\n\n00:14:02.638 --> 00:14:05.134\nwe're actually going now\nout into interstellar space,\n\n00:14:05.158 --> 00:14:08.014\nand we're getting a sense\nof the space around our home star.\n\n00:14:08.038 --> 00:14:10.734\nWhat I really wanted to do\nis to present this, basically,\n\n00:14:10.758 --> 00:14:13.054\nas wonderfully 3D as it is actually is.\n\n00:14:13.078 --> 00:14:15.054\nAnd also show the dynamics,\n\n00:14:15.078 --> 00:14:18.774\nand a lot of the interesting objects\nthat you might find, like, in the Hubble,\n\n00:14:18.798 --> 00:14:21.054\nat pretty much realistic\nfrequencies and scales.\n\n00:14:21.078 --> 00:14:23.214\nSo most people\nhave no idea of the difference\n\n00:14:23.238 --> 00:14:25.614\nbetween an emission nebula\nand a planetary nebula.\n\n00:14:25.638 --> 00:14:26.894\nBut these are the things\n\n00:14:26.918 --> 00:14:28.974\nthat we can put\nin this little galaxy here.\n\n00:14:28.998 --> 00:14:31.734\nSo we're flying over here\nto what looks like a black hole.\n\n00:14:31.758 --> 00:14:34.454\nI want to basically have\nthe entire zoo of Hubble objects\n\n00:14:34.478 --> 00:14:37.334\nthat people can interact with\nand play with, again, as toys.\n\n00:14:37.358 --> 00:14:38.774\nSo here's a little black hole\n\n00:14:38.798 --> 00:14:41.118\nthat we probably\ndon't want to get too close to.\n\n00:14:42.078 --> 00:14:44.094\nBut we also have stars and things as well.\n\n00:14:44.118 --> 00:14:47.574\nIf we pull all the way back,\nwe start seeing the entire galaxy here,\n\n00:14:47.598 --> 00:14:49.534\nkind of slowly in motion.\n\n00:14:49.558 --> 00:14:52.774\nTypically, when people present galaxies,\n\n00:14:52.798 --> 00:14:55.481\nit's always beautiful photos,\nbut they're always static.\n\n00:14:55.505 --> 00:14:58.394\nAnd when you bring it forward in time\nand start animating it,\n\n00:14:58.418 --> 00:15:01.212\nit's amazing what a galaxy\nwould look like fast forwarded.\n\n00:15:01.236 --> 00:15:03.393\nThis would be about\na million years a second,\n\n00:15:03.417 --> 00:15:06.014\nbecause you have about\none supernova every century.\n\n00:15:06.038 --> 00:15:08.374\nAnd so you'd have\nthis wonderful sparkling thing,\n\n00:15:08.398 --> 00:15:09.854\nwith the disk slowly rotating,\n\n00:15:09.878 --> 00:15:11.974\nand this is roughly\nwhat it would look like.\n\n00:15:11.998 --> 00:15:14.994\nPart of this is about bringing\nthe beauty of the natural world\n\n00:15:15.018 --> 00:15:16.874\nto somebody in a very imaginative way,\n\n00:15:16.898 --> 00:15:19.234\nso that they can start\ncalibrating their instinct\n\n00:15:19.258 --> 00:15:21.314\nacross these vast scales\nof space and time.\n\n00:15:21.338 --> 00:15:25.574\nChris was wondering what kind of gods\nthe players would become.\n\n00:15:25.598 --> 00:15:27.054\nBecause if you think about it,\n\n00:15:27.078 --> 00:15:30.674\nyou're going to have 15-year-olds,\n20-year-olds flying around this universe.\n\n00:15:30.698 --> 00:15:32.154\nThey might be a nurturing god.\n\n00:15:32.178 --> 00:15:34.274\nThey might be bootstrapping\nlife on planets,\n\n00:15:34.298 --> 00:15:36.394\ntrying to terraform\nand spread civilization.\n\n00:15:36.418 --> 00:15:38.654\nYou might be a vengeful god, conquesting,\n\n00:15:38.678 --> 00:15:42.134\nbecause you actually can do that,\nyou can attack other intelligent races.\n\n00:15:42.158 --> 00:15:45.180\nYou might be a networking god,\nbuilding alliances,\n\n00:15:45.204 --> 00:15:49.060\nor just curious, going around and wanting\nto explore as much as you possibly can.\n\n00:15:49.640 --> 00:15:53.385\nBut basically, the reason\nwhy I make toys like this\n\n00:15:53.409 --> 00:15:55.671\nis because I think\nif there's one difference\n\n00:15:55.695 --> 00:15:58.414\nI could possibly make in the world,\n\n00:15:58.438 --> 00:15:59.814\nthat I would choose to make,\n\n00:15:59.838 --> 00:16:01.974\nit's that I would like\nto somehow give people\n\n00:16:01.998 --> 00:16:04.814\njust a little bit better calibration\non long-term thinking.\n\n00:16:04.838 --> 00:16:08.174\nBecause I think most of the problems\nthat our world is facing right now\n\n00:16:08.198 --> 00:16:10.014\nare the result of short-term thinking,\n\n00:16:10.038 --> 00:16:14.214\nand the fact that it is so hard for us\nto think 50, 100, or 1,000 years out.\n\n00:16:14.238 --> 00:16:17.894\nAnd I think by giving kids toys like this\nand letting them replay dynamics,\n\n00:16:17.918 --> 00:16:20.014\nvery long-term dynamics\nover the short term,\n\n00:16:20.038 --> 00:16:22.254\nand getting some sense\nof what we're doing now,\n\n00:16:22.278 --> 00:16:24.214\nwhat it's going to be like in 100 years,\n\n00:16:24.238 --> 00:16:28.214\nI think probably is the most effective\nthing I can be doing to help the world.\n\n00:16:28.238 --> 00:16:30.905\nAnd so that's why I think\nthat toys can change the world.\n\n00:16:30.929 --> 00:16:32.129\nThank you."}, {"title": "The  4 a.m. mystery", "duration": "552", "url":

The punch line? \"On the other hand, I don't have to get up at four every single morning to milk my Labrador.\" This is a recent cover of New York Magazine. Best hospitals where doctors say they would go for cancer treatment, births, strokes, heart disease, hip replacements, 4 a.m. emergencies. And this is a song medley I put together \u2014(Music)Did you ever notice that four in the morning has become some sort of meme or shorthand? It means something like you are awake at the worst possible hour.(Laughter)A time for inconveniences, mishaps, yearnings. A time for plotting to whack the chief of police, like in this classic scene from \"The Godfather.\" Coppola's script describes these guys as, \"exhausted in shirt sleeves. It is four in the morning.\"(Laughter)A time for even grimmer stuff than that, like autopsies and embalmings in Isabel Allende's \"The House of the Spirits.\" After the breathtaking green-haired Rosa is murdered, the doctors preserve her with unguents and morticians' paste. They worked until four o'clock in the morning.A time for even grimmer stuff than that, like in last April's New Yorker magazine. This short fiction piece by Martin Amis starts out, \"On September 11, 2001, he opened his eyes at 4 a.m. in Portland, Maine, and Mohamed Atta's last day began.\" For a time that I find to be the most placid and uneventful hour of the day, four in the morning sure gets an awful lot of bad press \u2014(Laughter)across a lot of different media from a lot of big names. And it made me suspicious. I figured, surely some of the most creative artistic minds in the world, really, aren't all defaulting back to this one easy trope like they invented it, right? Could it be there is something more going on here? Something deliberate, something secret, and who got the four in the morning bad rap ball rolling anyway? I say this guy \u2014 Alberto Giacometti, shown here with some of his sculptures on the Swiss 100 franc note. He did it with this famous piece from the New York Museum of Modern Art. Its title \u2014 \"The Palace at Four in the Morning \u2014(Laughter)1932. Not just the earliest cryptic reference to four in the morning I can find. I believe that this so-called first surrealist sculpture may provide an incredible key to virtually every artistic depiction of four in the morning to follow it. I call this The Giacometti Code, a TED exclusive. No, feel free to follow along on your Blackberries or your iPhones if you've got them.It works a little something like \u2014 this is a recent Google search for four in the morning. Results vary, of course. This is pretty typical. The top 10 results yield you four hits for Faron Young's song, \"It's Four in the Morning,\" three hits for Judi Dench's film, \"Four in the Morning,\" one hit for Wislawa Szymborska's poem, \"Four in the Morning.\" But what, you may ask, do a Polish poet, a British Dame, a country music hall of famer all have in common besides this totally excellent Google ranking?Well, let's start with Faron Young \u2014 who was born incidentally in 1932.(Laughter)In 1996, he shot himself in the head on December ninth \u2014 which incidentally is Judi Dench's birthday.(Laughter)But he didn't die on Dench's birthday. He languished until the following afternoon when he finally succumbed to a supposedly self-inflicted gunshot wound at the age of 64 \u2014 which incidentally is how old Alberto Giacometti was when he died.Where was Wislawa Szymborska during all this? She has the world's most absolutely watertight alibi. On that very day, December 10, 1996 while Mr. Four in the Morning, Faron Young, was giving up the ghost in Nashville, Tennessee, Ms. Four in the Morning \u2014 or one of them anyway \u2014 Wislawa Szymborska was in Stockholm, Sweden, accepting the Nobel Prize for Literature. 100 years to the day after the death of Alfred Nobel himself. Coincidence? No, it's creepy.(Laughter)Coincidence to me has a much simpler metric. That's like me telling you, \"Hey, you know the Nobel Prize was established in 1901, which coincidentally is the same year Alberto Giacometti was born?\" No, not everything fits so tidily into the paradigm, but that does not mean there's not something going on at the highest possible levels. In fact there are people in this room who may not want me to show you this clip we're about to see.(Laughter)Video: Homer Simpson: We have a tennis court, a swimming pool, a screening room \u2014 You mean if I want pork chops, even in the middle of the night, your guy will fry them up?Herbert Powell: Sure, that's what he's paid for. Now do you need towels, laundry, maids?HS: Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait \u2014 let me see if I got this straight. It is Christmas Day, 4 a.m. There's a rumble in my stomach.Marge Simpson: Homer, please.Rives: Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Let me see if I got this straight, Matt.(Laughter)When Homer Simpson needs to imagine the most remote possible moment of not just the clock, but the whole freaking calendar, he comes up with 0400 on the birthday of the Baby Jesus. And no, I don't know how it works into the whole puzzling scheme of things, but obviously I know a coded message when I see one.(Laughter)I said, I know a coded message when I see one. And folks, you can buy a copy of Bill Clinton's \"My Life\" from the bookstore here at TED. Parse it cover to cover for whatever hidden references you want. Or you can go to the Random House website where there is this excerpt. And how far down into it you figure we'll have to scroll to get to the golden ticket? Would you believe about a dozen paragraphs? This is page 474 on your paperbacks if you're following along: \"Though it was getting better, I still wasn't satisfied with the inaugural address. My speechwriters must have been tearing their hair out because as we worked between one and four in the morning on Inauguration Day, I was still changing it.\"Sure you were, because you've prepared your entire life for this historic quadrennial event that just sort of sneaks up on you. And then \u2014(Laughter)three paragraphs later we get this little beauty: \"We went back to Blair House to look at the speech for the last time. It had gotten a lot better since 4 a.m.\" Well, how could it have? By his own writing, this man was either asleep, at a prayer meeting with Al and Tipper or learning how to launch a nuclear missile out of a suitcase. What happens to American presidents at 0400 on inauguration day? What happened to William Jefferson Clinton? We might not ever know. And I noticed, he's not exactly around here today to face any tough questions.(Laughter)It could get awkward, right? I mean after all, this whole business happened on his watch. But if he were here \u2014(Laughter)he might remind us, as he does in the wrap-up to his fine autobiography, that on this day Bill Clinton began a journey \u2014 a journey that saw him go on to become the first Democrat president elected to two consecutive terms in decades. In generations. The first since this man, Franklin Delano Roosevelt, who began his own unprecedented journey way back at his own first election, way back in a simpler time, way back in 1932 \u2014 (Laughter)the year Alberto Giacometti(Laughter)made \"The Palace at Four in the Morning.\" The year, let's remember, that this voice, now departed, first came a-cryin' into this big old crazy world of ours.(Music)(Applause)", "id": 148, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:13.958 --> 00:00:15.958\nThis is a recent comic strip from the Los Angeles

"https://www.ted.com/talks/david_bolinsky_animates_a_cell", "transcript": "I'm a medical illustrator, and I come from a slightly different point of view. I've been watching, since I grew up, the expressions of truth and beauty in the arts and truth and beauty in the sciences. And while these are both wonderful things in their own right \u2014 they both have very wonderful things going for them \u2014 truth and beauty as ideals that can be looked at by the sciences and by math are almost like the ideal conjoined twins that a scientist would want to date. (Laughter) These are expressions of truth as awe-full things, by meaning they are things you can worship. They are ideals that are powerful. They are irreducible. They are unique. They are useful \u2014 sometimes, often a long time after the fact. And you can actually roll some of the pictures now, because I don't want to look at me on the screen.Truth and beauty are things that are often opaque to people who are not in the sciences. They are things that describe beauty in a way that is often only accessible if you understand the language and the syntax of the person who studies the subject in which truth and beauty is expressed. If you look at the math, E=mc squared, if you look at the cosmological constant, where there's an anthropic ideal, where you see that life had to evolve from the numbers that describe the universe \u2014 these are things that are really difficult to understand.And what I've tried to do since I had my training as a medical illustrator \u2014 since I was taught animation by my father, who was a sculptor and my visual mentor \u2014 I wanted to figure out a way to help people understand truth and beauty in the biological sciences by using animation, by using pictures, by telling stories so that the things that are not necessarily evident to people can be brought forth, and can be taught, and can be understood.Students today are often immersed in an environment where what they learn is subjects that have truth and beauty embedded in them, but the way they're taught is compartmentalized and it's drawn down to the point where the truth and beauty are not always evident. It's almost like that old recipe for chicken soup where you boil the chicken until the flavor is just gone. We don't want to do that to our students. So we have an opportunity to really open up education.And I had a telephone call from Robert Lue at Harvard, in the Molecular and Cellular Biology Department, a couple of years ago. He asked me if my team and I would be interested and willing to really change how medical and scientific education is done at Harvard. So we embarked on a project that would explore the cell \u2014 that would explore the truth and beauty inherent in molecular and cellular biology so that students could understand a larger picture that they could hang all of these facts on. They could have a mental image of the cell as a large, bustling, hugely complicated city that's occupied by micro-machines.And these micro-machines really are at the heart of life. These micro-machines, which are the envy of nanotechnologists the world over, are self-directed, powerful, precise, accurate devices that are made out of strings of amino acids. And these micro-machines power how a cell moves. They power how a cell replicates. They power our hearts. They power our minds.And so what we wanted to do was to figure out how we could make this story into an animation that would be the centerpiece of BioVisions at Harvard, which is a website that Harvard has for its molecular and cellular biology students that will \u2014 in addition to all the textual information, in addition to all the didactic stuff \u2014 put everything together visually, so that these students would have an internalized view of what a cell really is in all of its truth and beauty, and be able to study with this view in mind, so that their imaginations would be sparked, so that their passions would be sparked and so that they would be able to go on and use these visions in their head to make new discoveries and to be able to find out, really, how life works.So we set out by looking at how these molecules are put together. We worked with a theme, which is, you've got macrophages that are streaming down a capillary, and they're touching the surface of the capillary wall, and they're picking up information from cells that are on the capillary wall, and they are given this information that there's an inflammation somewhere outside, where they can't see and sense. But they get the information that causes them to stop, causes them to internalize that they need to make all of the various parts that will cause them to change their shape, and try to get out of this capillary and find out what's going on.So these molecular motors \u2014 we had to work with the Harvard scientists and databank models of the atomically accurate molecules and figure out how they moved, and figure out what they did. And figure out how to do this in a way that was truthful in that it imparted what was going on, but not so truthful that the compact crowding in a cell would prevent the vista from happening.And so what I'm going to show you is a three-minute Reader's Digest version of the first aspect of this film that we produced. It's an ongoing project that's going to go another four or five years. And I want you to look at this and see the paths that the cell manufactures \u2014 these little walking machines, they're called kinesins \u2014 that take these huge loads that would challenge an ant in relative size. Run the movie, please.But these machines that power the inside of the cells are really quite amazing, and they really are the basis of all life because all of these machines interact with each other. They pass information to each other. They cause different things to happen inside the cell. And the cell will actually manufacture the parts that it needs on the fly, from information that's brought from the nucleus by molecules that read the genes. No life, from the smallest life to everybody here, would be possible without these little micro-machines. In fact, it would really, in the absence of these machines, have made the attendance here, Chris, really quite sparse. (Laughter) (Music)This is the FedEx delivery guy of the cell. This little guy is called the kinesin, and he pulls a sack that's full of brand new manufactured proteins to wherever it's needed in the cell \u2014 whether it's to a membrane, whether it's to an organelle, whether it's to build something or repair something. And each of us has about 100,000 of these things running around, right now, inside each one of your 100 trillion cells. So no matter how lazy you feel, you're not really intrinsically doing nothing. (Laughter)So what I want you to do when you go home is think about this, and think about how powerful our cells are. And think about some of the things that we're learning about cellular mechanics. Once we figure out all that's going on \u2014 and believe me, we know almost a percent of what's going on \u2014 once we figure out what's going on, we're really going to be able to have a lot of control over what we do with our health, with what we do with future generations, and how long we're going to live. And hopefully we'll be able to use this to discover more truth, and more beauty. (Music)But it's really quite amazing that these cells, these micro-machines, are aware enough of what the cell needs that they do their bidding. They work together. They make the cell do what it needs to do. And their working together helps our bodies \u2014 huge entities that they will never see \u2014 function properly. Enjoy the rest of the show. Thank you.

He asked me if my team and I\n\n00:03:07.958 --> 00:03:11.958\nwould be interested and willing to really change\n\n00:03:11.958 --> 00:03:14.958\nhow medical and scientific education is done at Harvard.\n\n00:03:14.958 --> 00:03:19.958\nSo we embarked on a project that would explore the cell --\n\n00:03:19.958 --> 00:03:22.958\nthat would explore the truth and beauty inherent\n\n00:03:22.958 --> 00:03:24.958\nin molecular and cellular biology\n\n00:03:24.958 --> 00:03:27.958\nso that students could understand a larger picture\n\n00:03:27.958 --> 00:03:30.958\nthat they could hang all of these facts on.\n\n00:03:30.958 --> 00:03:33.958\nThey could have a mental image of the cell\n\n00:03:33.958 --> 00:03:40.958\nas a large, bustling, hugely complicated city\n\n00:03:41.958 --> 00:03:43.958\nthat's occupied by micro-machines.\n\n00:03:43.958 --> 00:03:46.958\nAnd these micro-machines really are at the heart of life.\n\n00:03:46.958 --> 00:03:47.958\nThese micro-machines,\n\n00:03:47.958 --> 00:03:50.958\nwhich are the envy of nanotechnologists the world over,\n\n00:03:51.958 --> 00:03:58.958\nare self-directed, powerful, precise, accurate devices\n\n00:03:58.958 --> 00:04:01.958\nthat are made out of strings of amino acids.\n\n00:04:01.958 --> 00:04:05.958\nAnd these micro-machines power how a cell moves.\n\n00:04:05.958 --> 00:04:10.958\nThey power how a cell replicates. They power our hearts.\n\n00:04:10.958 --> 00:04:11.958\nThey power our minds.\n\n00:04:12.958 --> 00:04:15.958\nAnd so what we wanted to do was to figure out\n\n00:04:16.958 --> 00:04:18.958\nhow we could make this story into an animation\n\n00:04:19.958 --> 00:04:22.958\nthat would be the centerpiece of BioVisions at Harvard,\n\n00:04:23.958 --> 00:04:27.958\nwhich is a website that Harvard has\n\n00:04:27.958 --> 00:04:29.958\nfor its molecular and cellular biology students\n\n00:04:29.958 --> 00:04:33.958\nthat will -- in addition to all the textual information,\n\n00:04:34.958 --> 00:04:35.958\nin addition to all the didactic stuff --\n\n00:04:36.958 --> 00:04:38.958\nput everything together visually, so that these students\n\n00:04:39.958 --> 00:04:43.958\nwould have an internalized view of what a cell really is\n\n00:04:43.958 --> 00:04:47.958\nin all of its truth and beauty, and be able to study\n\n00:04:47.958 --> 00:04:51.958\nwith this view in mind, so that their imaginations would be sparked,\n\n00:04:51.958 --> 00:04:53.958\nso that their passions would be sparked\n\n00:04:54.958 --> 00:04:55.958\nand so that they would be able to go on\n\n00:04:56.958 --> 00:05:00.958\nand use these visions in their head to make new discoveries\n\n00:05:00.958 --> 00:05:03.958\nand to be able to find out, really, how life works.\n\n00:05:03.958 --> 00:05:09.958\nSo we set out by looking at how these molecules are put together.\n\n00:05:10.958 --> 00:05:15.958\nWe worked with a theme, which is, you've got macrophages\n\n00:05:16.958 --> 00:05:17.958\nthat are streaming down a capillary,\n\n00:05:18.958 --> 00:05:20.958\nand they're touching the surface of the capillary wall,\n\n00:05:21.958 --> 00:05:23.958\nand they're picking up information from cells\n\n00:05:23.958 --> 00:05:27.958\nthat are on the capillary wall, and they are given this information\n\n00:05:27.958 --> 00:05:30.958\nthat there's an inflammation somewhere outside,\n\n00:05:30.958 --> 00:05:32.958\nwhere they can't see and sense.\n\n00:05:32.958 --> 00:05:35.958\nBut they get the information that causes them to stop,\n\n00:05:35.958 --> 00:05:39.958\ncauses them to internalize that they need to make\n\n00:05:39.958 --> 00:05:43.958\nall of the various parts that will cause them to change their shape,\n\n00:05:44.958 --> 00:05:48.958\nand try to get out of this capillary and find out what's going on.\n\n00:05:49.958 --> 00:05:51.958\nSo these molecular motors -- we had to work\n\n00:05:51.958 --> 00:05:56.958\nwith the Harvard scientists and databank models\n\n00:05:57.958 --> 00:06:00.958\nof the atomically accurate molecules\n\n00:06:00.958 --> 00:06:03.958\nand figure out how they moved, and figure out what they did.\n\n00:06:04.958 --> 00:06:06.958\nAnd figure out how to do this in a way\n\n00:06:06.958 --> 00:06:11.958\nthat was truthful in that it imparted what was going on,\n\n00:06:12.958 --> 00:06:17.958\nbut not so truthful that the compact crowding in a cell\n\n00:06:17.958 --> 00:06:20.958\nwould prevent the vista from happening.\n\n00:06:20.958 --> 00:06:24.958\nAnd so what I'm going to show you is a three-minute\n\n00:06:24.958 --> 00:06:27.958\nReader's Digest version of the first aspect of this film\n\n00:06:27.958 --> 00:06:30.958\nthat we produced. It's an ongoing project\n\n00:06:30.958 --> 00:06:32.958\nthat's going to go another four or five years.\n\n00:06:33.958 --> 00:06:35.958\nAnd I want you to look at this\n\n00:06:35.958 --> 00:06:39.958\nand see the paths that the cell manufactures --\n\n00:06:39.958 --> 00:06:42.958\nthese little walking machines, they're called kinesins --\n\n00:06:43.958 --> 00:06:44.958\nthat take these huge loads\n\n00:06:45.958 --> 00:06:47.958\nthat would challenge an ant in relative size.\n\n00:06:48.958 --> 00:06:51.958\nRun the movie, please.\n\n00:06:52.958 --> 00:06:55.958\nBut these machines that power the inside of the cells\n\n00:06:55.958 --> 00:06:59.958\nare really quite amazing, and they really are the basis of all life\n\n00:06:59.958 --> 00:07:03.958\nbecause all of these machines interact with each other.\n\n00:07:04.958 --> 00:07:05.958\nThey pass information to each other.\n\n00:07:06.958 --> 00:07:08.958\nThey cause different things to happen inside the cell.\n\n00:07:09.958 --> 00:07:12.958\nAnd the cell will actually manufacture the parts that it needs\n\n00:07:12.958 --> 00:07:14.958\non the fly, from information\n\n00:07:14.958 --> 00:07:18.958\nthat's brought from the nucleus by molecules that read the genes.\n\n00:07:19.958 --> 00:07:23.958\nNo life, from the smallest life to everybody here,\n\n00:07:24.958 --> 00:07:26.958\nwould be possible without these little micro-machines.\n\n00:07:27.958 --> 00:07:30.958\nIn fact, it would really, in the absence of these machines,\n\n00:07:31.958 --> 00:07:33.958\nhave made the attendance here, Chris, really quite sparse.\n\n00:07:33.958 --> 00:07:37.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:07:37.958 --> 00:07:49.958\n(Music)\n\n00:07:49.958 --> 00:07:51.958\nThis is the FedEx delivery guy of the cell.\n\n00:07:53.958 --> 00:07:54.958\nThis little guy is called the kinesin,\n\n00:07:55.958 --> 00:07:59.958\nand he pulls a sack that's full of brand new manufactured proteins\n\n00:07:59.958 --> 00:08:01.958\nto wherever it's needed in the cell --\n\n00:08:01.958 --> 00:08:04.958\nwhether it's to a membrane, whether it's to an organelle,\n\n00:08:04.958 --> 00:08:06.958\nwhether it's to build something or repair something.\n\n00:08:06.958 --> 00:08:10.958\nAnd each of us has about 100,000 of these things\n\n00:08:10.958 --> 00:08:11.958\nrunning around, right now,\n\n00:08:12.958 --> 00:08:15.958\ninside each one of your 100 trillion cells.\n\n00:08:15.958 --> 00:08:17.958\nSo no matter how lazy you feel,\n\n00:08:18.958 --> 00:08:20.958\nyou're not really intrinsically doing nothing.\n\n00:08:20.958 --> 00:08:24.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:08:24.958 --> 00:08:26.958\nSo what I want you to do when you go home\n\n00:08:26.958 --> 00:08:29.958\nis think about this, and think about how powerful our cells are.\n\n00:08:30.958 --> 00:08:31.958\nAnd think about some of the things\n\n00:08:31.958 --> 00:08:35.958\nthat we're learning about cellular mechanics.\n\n00:08:35.958 --> 00:08:38.958\nOnce we figure out all that's going on --\n\n00:08:38.958 --> 00:08:41.958\nand believe me, we know almost a percent of what's going on --\n\n00:08:42.958 --> 00:08:43.958\nonce we figure out what's going on,\n\n00:08:43.958 --> 00:08:46.958\nwe're really going to be able to have a lot of control\n\n00:08:46.958 --> 00:08:48.958\nover what we do with our health,\n\n00:08:48.958 --> 00:08:51.958\nwith what we do with future generations,\n\n00:08:51.958 --> 00:08:52.958\nand how long we're going to live.\n\n00:08:53.958 --> 00:08:55.958\nAnd hopefully we'll be able to use this\n\n00:08:55.958 --> 00:08:58.958\nto discover more truth, and more beauty.\n\n00:08:58.958 --> 00:09:12.958\n(Music)\n\n00:09:12.958 --> 00:09:16.958\nBut it's really quite amazing that these cells, these micro-machines,\n\n00:09:17.958 --> 00:09:22.958\nare aware enough of what the cell needs that they do their bidding.\n\n00:09:22.958 --> 00:09:26.958\nThey work together.

Reset the three minutes, that's just not fair.AH: Oh my God, it's harsh up here. I mean I'm nervous enough as it is.But I am not as nervous as I was five weeks ago. Five weeks ago I had total hip replacement surgery. Do you know that surgery? Electric saw, power drill, totally disgusting unless you're David Bolinsky, in which case it's all truth and beauty. Sure David, if it's not your hip, it's truth and beauty.Anyway, I did have a really big epiphany around the situation, so Chris invited me to tell you about it. But first you need to know two things about me. Just two things. I'm Canadian, and I'm the youngest of seven kids. Now, in Canada, we have that great healthcare system. That means we get our new hips for free. And being the youngest of seven, I have never been at the front of the line for anything. OK?So my hip had been hurting me for years. I finally went to the doctor, which was free. And she referred me to an orthopedic surgeon, also free. Finally got to see him after 10 months of waiting \u2014 almost a year. That is what free gets you. I met the surgeon, and he took some free X-rays, and I got a good look at them. And you know, even I could tell my hip was bad, and I actually work in marketing. So he said, \"Allison, we've got to get you on the table. I'm going to replace your hip \u2014 it's about an 18-month wait.\" 18 more months. I'd already waited 10 months, and I had to wait 18 more months.You know, it's such a long wait that I actually started to even think about it in terms of TEDs. I wouldn't have my new hip for this TED. I wouldn't have my new hip for TEDGlobal in Africa. I would not have my new hip for TED2008. I would still be on my bad hip. That was so disappointing.So, I left his office and I was walking through the hospital, and that's when I had my epiphany. This youngest of seven had to get herself to the front of the line. Oh yeah.Can I tell you how un-Canadian that is? We do not think that way. We don't talk about it. It's not even a consideration. In fact, when we're traveling abroad, it's how we identify fellow Canadians. \"After you.\" \"Oh, no, no. After you.\" Hey, are you from Canada? \"Oh, me too! Hi!\" \"Great! Excellent!\"So no, suddenly I wasn't averse to butting any geezer off the list. Some 70-year-old who wanted his new hip so he could be back golfing, or gardening. No, no. Front of the line.So by now I was walking the lobby, and of course, that hurt, because of my hip, and I kind of needed a sign. And I saw a sign. In the window of the hospital's tiny gift shop there was a sign that said, \"Volunteers Needed.\" Hmm. Well, they signed me up immediately. No reference checks. None of the usual background stuff, no. They were desperate for volunteers because the average age of the volunteer at the hospital gift shop was 75. Yeah. They needed some young blood.So, next thing you know, I had my bright blue volunteer vest, I had my photo ID, and I was fully trained by my 89-year-old boss. I worked alone. Every Friday morning I was at the gift shop. While ringing in hospital staff's Tic Tacs, I'd casually ask, \"What do you do?\" Then I'd tell them, \"Well, I'm getting my hip replaced \u2014 in 18 months. It's gonna be so great when the pain stops. Ow!\" All the staff got to know the plucky, young volunteer.My next surgeon's appointment was, coincidentally, right after a shift at the gift shop. So, naturally, I had my vest and my identification. I draped them casually over the chair in the doctor's office. And you know, when he walked in, I could just tell that he saw them. Moments later, I had a surgery date just weeks away, and a big fat prescription for Percocet.Now, word on the street was that it was actually my volunteering that got me to the front of the line. And, you know, I'm not even ashamed of that. Two reasons. First of all, I am going to take such good care of this new hip. But also I intend to stick with the volunteering, which actually leads me to the biggest epiphany of them all.

OK?\n\n00:01:08.958 --> 00:01:10.958\nSo my hip had been hurting me for years.\n\n00:01:10.958 --> 00:01:13.958\nI finally went to the doctor, which was free.\n\n00:01:13.958 --> 00:01:16.958\nAnd she referred me to an orthopedic surgeon, also free.\n\n00:01:17.958 --> 00:01:21.958\nFinally got to see him after 10 months of waiting -- almost a year.\n\n00:01:21.958 --> 00:01:24.958\nThat is what free gets you.\n\n00:01:25.958 --> 00:01:28.958\nI met the surgeon, and he took some free X-rays,\n\n00:01:28.958 --> 00:01:30.958\nand I got a good look at them. And you know,\n\n00:01:30.958 --> 00:01:32.958\neven I could tell my hip was bad,\n\n00:01:32.958 --> 00:01:34.958\nand I actually work in marketing.\n\n00:01:34.958 --> 00:01:38.958\nSo he said, \"Allison, we've got to get you on the table.\n\n00:01:38.958 --> 00:01:41.958\nI'm going to replace your hip -- it's about an 18-month wait.\"\n\n00:01:41.958 --> 00:01:43.958\n18 more months.\n\n00:01:43.958 --> 00:01:47.958\nI'd already waited 10 months, and I had to wait 18 more months.\n\n00:01:47.958 --> 00:01:49.958\nYou know, it's such a long wait that I actually\n\n00:01:49.958 --> 00:01:51.958\nstarted to even think about it in terms of TEDs.\n\n00:01:51.958 --> 00:01:53.958\nI wouldn't have my new hip for this TED.\n\n00:01:53.958 --> 00:01:56.958\nI wouldn't have my new hip for TEDGlobal in Africa.\n\n00:01:56.958 --> 00:01:58.958\nI would not have my new hip for TED2008.\n\n00:01:58.958 --> 00:02:01.958\nI would still be on my bad hip. That was so disappointing.\n\n00:02:01.958 --> 00:02:05.958\nSo, I left his office and I was walking through the hospital,\n\n00:02:05.958 --> 00:02:07.958\nand that's when I had my epiphany.\n\n00:02:08.958 --> 00:02:12.958\nThis youngest of seven had to get herself to the front of the line.\n\n00:02:12.958 --> 00:02:14.958\nOh yeah.\n\n00:02:14.958 --> 00:02:16.958\nCan I tell you how un-Canadian that is?\n\n00:02:16.958 --> 00:02:18.958\nWe do not think that way.\n\n00:02:18.958 --> 00:02:21.958\nWe don't talk about it. It's not even a consideration.\n\n00:02:21.958 --> 00:02:25.958\nIn fact, when we're traveling abroad, it's how we identify fellow Canadians.\n\n00:02:25.958 --> 00:02:27.958\n\"After you.\" \"Oh, no, no. After you.\"\n\n00:02:27.958 --> 00:02:29.958\nHey, are you from Canada? \"Oh, me too! Hi!\"\n\n00:02:29.958 --> 00:02:32.958\n\"Great! Excellent!\"\n\n00:02:32.958 --> 00:02:36.958\nSo no, suddenly I wasn't averse to butting any geezer off the list.\n\n00:02:36.958 --> 00:02:38.958\nSome 70-year-old who wanted his new hip\n\n00:02:38.958 --> 00:02:40.958\nso he could be back golfing, or gardening.\n\n00:02:40.958 --> 00:02:42.958\nNo, no. Front of the line.\n\n00:02:42.958 --> 00:02:45.958\nSo by now I was walking the lobby, and of course, that hurt,\n\n00:02:45.958 --> 00:02:48.958\nbecause of my hip, and I kind of needed a sign.\n\n00:02:48.958 --> 00:02:51.958\nAnd I saw a sign.\n\n00:02:51.958 --> 00:02:55.958\nIn the window of the hospital's tiny gift shop there was a sign\n\n00:02:55.958 --> 00:02:59.958\nthat said, \"Volunteers Needed.\" Hmm.\n\n00:02:59.958 --> 00:03:02.958\nWell, they signed me up immediately.\n\n00:03:02.958 --> 00:03:05.958\nNo reference checks. None of the usual background stuff, no.\n\n00:03:05.958 --> 00:03:07.958\nThey were desperate for volunteers\n\n00:03:07.958 --> 00:03:11.958\nbecause the average age of the volunteer at the hospital gift shop was 75.\n\n00:03:11.958 --> 00:03:14.958\nYeah. They needed some young blood.\n\n00:03:14.958 --> 00:03:17.958\nSo, next thing you know, I had my bright blue volunteer vest,\n\n00:03:17.958 --> 00:03:21.958\nI had my photo ID, and I was fully trained by my 89-year-old boss.\n\n00:03:21.958 --> 00:03:23.958\nI worked alone.\n\n00:03:23.958 --> 00:03:26.958\nEvery Friday morning I was at the gift shop.\n\n00:03:26.958 --> 00:03:28.958\nWhile ringing in hospital staff's Tic Tacs,\n\n00:03:29.958 --> 00:03:31.958\nI'd casually ask, \"What do you do?\"\n\n00:03:31.958 --> 00:03:36.958\nThen I'd tell them, \"Well, I'm getting my hip replaced -- in 18 months.\n\n00:03:37.958 --> 00:03:41.958\nIt's gonna be so great when the pain stops. Ow!\"\n\n00:03:42.958 --> 00:03:47.958\nAll the staff got to know the plucky, young volunteer.\n\n00:03:49.958 --> 00:03:51.958\nMy next surgeon's appointment was, coincidentally,\n\n00:03:52.958 --> 00:03:54.958\nright after a shift at the gift shop.\n\n00:03:54.958 --> 00:03:57.958\nSo, naturally, I had my vest and my identification.\n\n00:03:58.958 --> 00:04:00.958\nI draped them casually over the chair in the doctor's office.\n\n00:04:00.958 --> 00:04:02.958\nAnd you know, when he walked in,\n\n00:04:02.958 --> 00:04:04.958\nI could just tell that he saw them.\n\n00:04:04.958 --> 00:04:08.958\nMoments later, I had a surgery date just weeks away,\n\n00:04:08.958 --> 00:04:11.958\nand a big fat prescription for Percocet.\n\n00:04:13.958 --> 00:04:15.958\nNow, word on the street was that it was actually\n\n00:04:15.958 --> 00:04:17.958\nmy volunteering that got me to the front of the line.\n\n00:04:17.958 --> 00:04:20.958\nAnd, you know, I'm not even ashamed of that.\n\n00:04:20.958 --> 00:04:21.958\nTwo reasons.\n\n00:04:21.958 --> 00:04:23.958\nFirst of all, I am going to take such good care of this new hip.\n\n00:04:23.958 --> 00:04:26.958\nBut also I intend to stick with the volunteering,\n\n00:04:26.958 --> 00:04:30.958\nwhich actually leads me to the biggest epiphany of them all.\n\n00:04:30.958 --> 00:04:33.958\nEven when a Canadian cheats the system,\n\n00:04:33.958 --> 00:04:35.958\nthey do it in a way that benefits society."}, {"title": "Africa's cheetahs versus hippos", "duration": "1070", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/george_ayittey_on_cheetahs_vs_hippos", "transcript": "Well, first of all, let me thank Emeka \u2014 as a matter of fact, TED Global \u2014 for putting this conference together. This conference is going to rank as the most important in the beginning of the 21st century. Think African governments will put together a conference like this? You think the A.U. will put together a conference like this? Even before they do that they will ask for foreign aid. I would also like to pay homage and honor to the TED Fellows June Arunga, James Shikwati, Andrew, and the other TED Fellows. I call them the Cheetah Generation. The Cheetah Generation is a new breed of Africans who brook no nonsense about corruption. They understand what accountability and democracy is. They're not going to wait for government to do things for them. That's the Cheetah Generation, and Africa's salvation rests on the backs of these Cheetahs. In contrast, of course, we have the Hippo Generation.(Laughter)The Hippo Generation are the ruling elites. They are stuck in their intellectual patch. Complaining about colonialism and imperialism, they wouldn't move one foot. If you ask them to reform the economies, they're not going to reform it because they benefit from the rotten status quo. Now, there are a lot of Africans who are very angry, angry at the condition of Africa. Now, we're talking about a continent that is not poor. It is rich in mineral resources, natural mineral resources. But the mineral wealth of Africa is not being utilized to lift its people out of poverty. That's what makes a lot of Africans very angry. And in a way, Africa is more than a tragedy, in more ways than one. There's another enduring tragedy, and that tragedy is that there are so many people, so many governments, so many organizations who want to help the people in Africa. They don't understand. Now, we're not saying don't help Africa. Helping Africa is noble. But helping Africa has been turned into a theater of the absurd. It's like the blind leading the clueless.(Laughter)There are certain things that we need to recognize. Africa's begging-bowl leaks. Did you know that 40 percent of the wealth created in Africa is not invested here in Africa? It's taken out of Africa. That's what the World Bank says. Look at Africa's begging-bowl. It leaks horribly. There are people who think that we should pour more money, more aid into this bowl which leaks. What are the leakages? Corruption alone costs Africa 148 billion dollars a year. Yes, put that aside. Capital flight out of Africa, 80 billion a year. Put that aside. Let's take food imports. Every year Africa spends 20 billion dollars to import food. Just add that up, all these leakages. That's far more than the 50 billion Tony Blair wants to raise for Africa. Now, back in the 1960s Africa not only fed itself, it also exported food. Not anymore.We know that something has gone fundamentally wrong. You know it, I know it, but let's not waste our time talking about these mistakes because we'll spend all day here. Let's move on, and flip over to the next chapter, and that's what this conference is all about \u2014 the next chapter. The next chapter begins with first of all, asking ourselves this fundamental question, \"Whom do we want to help in Africa?\" There is the people, and then there is the government or leaders. Now, the previous speaker before me, Idris Mohammed, indicated that we've had abysmal leadership in Africa. That characterization, in my view, is even more charitable.(Laughter)I belong to an Internet discussion forum, an African Internet discussion forum, and I asked them, I said, \"Since 1960, we've had exactly 204 African heads of state, since 1960.\" And I asked them to name me just 20 good leaders, just 20 good leaders \u2014 you may want to take this leadership challenge yourself. I asked them to name me just 20. Everybody mentioned Nelson Mandela, of course. Kwame Nkrumah, Nyerere, Kenyatta \u2014 somebody mentioned Idi Amin.(Laughter)I let that pass.(Laughter)My point is, they couldn't go beyond 15. Even if they had been able to name me 20, what does that tell you? 20 out of 204 means that the vast majority of the African leaders failed their people. And if you look at them, the slate of the post-colonial leaders \u2014 an assortment of military fufu heads, Swiss-bank socialists, crocodile liberators, vampire elites, quack revolutionaries.(Applause)Now, this leadership is a far cry from the traditional leaders that Africans have known for centuries. The second false premise that we make when we're trying to help Africa is that sometimes we think that there is something called a government in Africa that cares about its people, serves the interests of the people, and represents the people. There is one particular quote \u2014 a Lesotho chief once said that \"Here in Lesotho, we've got two problems: rats and the government.\"(Laughter)What you and I understand as a government doesn't exist in many African countries. In fact, what we call our governments are vampire states. Vampires because they suck the economic vitality out of their people. Government is the problem in Africa. A vampire state is the government \u2014 (Applause) \u2014 which has been hijacked by a phalanx of bandits and crooks who use the instruments of state power to enrich themselves, their cronies, and tribesmen and exclude everybody else. The richest people in Africa are heads-of-state and ministers, and quite often the chief bandit is the head-of-state himself. Where do they get their money? By creating wealth? No. By raking it off the backs of their suffering people. That's not wealth creation. It's wealth redistribution.The third fundamental issue that we have to recognize is that if we want to help the African people, we must know where the African people are. Take any African economy. An African economy can be broken up into three sectors. There is the modern sector, there is the informal sector and the traditional sector. The modern sector is the abode of the elites. It's the seat of government. In many African countries the modern sector is lost. It's dysfunctional. It is a meretricious fandango of imported systems, which the elites themselves don't understand. That is the source of many of Africa's problems where the struggles for political power emanate and then spill over onto the informal and the traditional sector, claiming innocent lives.Now the modern sector, of course, is where a lot of the development aid and resources went into. More than 80 percent of Ivory Coast's development went into the modern sector. The other sectors, the informal and the traditional sectors, are where you find the majority of the African people, the real people in Africa. That's where you find them. Now, obviously it makes common sense that if you want to help the people, you go where the people are. But that's not what we did. As a matter of fact, we neglected the informal and the traditional sectors. Now, traditional sector is where Africa produces its agriculture, which is one of the reasons why Africa can't feed itself, and that's why it must import food.All right, you cannot develop Africa by ignoring the informal and the traditional sectors. And you can't develop the informal and the traditional sectors without an operational understanding of how these two sectors work. These two sectors, let me describe to you, have their own indigenous institutions. First one is the political system. Traditionally, Africans hate governments. They hate tyranny. If you look into their traditional systems, Africans organize their states in two types. The first one belongs to those ethnic societies who believe that the state was necessarily tyrannous, so they didn't want to have anything to do with any centralized authority. These societies are the Ibo, the Somali, the Kikuyus, for example. They have no chiefs.The other ethnic groups, which did have chiefs, made sure that they surrounded the chiefs with councils upon councils upon councils to prevent them from abusing their power. In Ashanti tradition, for example, the chief cannot make any decision without the concurrence of the council of elders. Without the council the chief can't pass any law, and if the chief doesn't govern according to the will of the people he will be removed. If not, the people will abandon the chief, go somewhere else and set up a new settlement. And even if you look in ancient African empires, they were all organized around one particular principle \u2014 the confederacy principle, which is characterized by a great deal of devolution of authority, decentralization of power.Now, this is what I have described to you. This is part of Africa's indigenous political heritage. Now, compare that to the modern systems the ruling elites established on Africa. It is a total far cry. In the economic system in traditional Africa, the means of production is privately owned. It's owned by extended families. You see, in the West, the basic economic and social unit is the individual. The American will say, \"I am because I am, and I can damn well do anything I want, anytime.\" The accent is on the \"I.\" In Africa, the Africans say, \"I am, because we are.\" The \"we\" connotes community \u2014 the extended family system. The extended family system pools its resources together.They own farms. They decide what to do, what to produce. They don't take any orders from their chiefs. They decide what to do. And when they produce their crops, they sell the surplus on marketplaces. When they make a profit it is theirs to keep, not for the chief to sequester it from them. So, in a nutshell, what we had in traditional Africa was a free-market system. There were markets in Africa before the colonialists stepped foot on the continent. Timbuktu was one great big market town. Kano, Salaga \u2014 they were all there. Even if you go to West Africa, you notice that market activity in West Africa has always been dominated by women. So, it's quite appropriate that this section is called a marketplace. The market is not alien to Africa.What Africans practiced was a different form of capitalism, but then after independence, all of a sudden, markets, capitalism became a western institution, and the leaders said Africans were ready for socialism. Nonsense. And even then, what kind of socialism did they practice? The socialism that they practiced was a peculiar form of Swiss-bank socialism, which allowed the heads of states and the ministers to rape and plunder Africa's treasuries for deposit in Switzerland. That is not the kind of system Africans had known for centuries. What do we do now? Go back to Africa's indigenous institutions, and this is where we charge the Cheetahs to go into the informal sectors, the traditional sectors. That's where you find the African people.And I'd like to show you a quick little video about the informal sector, about the boat-building that I, myself, tried to mobilize Africans in the Diaspora to invest in. Could you please show that? The men are going fishing in these small boats. Yes, it's an enterprise. This is by a local Ghanaian entrepreneur, using his own capital. He's getting no assistance from the government, and he's building a second, bigger boat. A bigger boat will mean more fish will be caught and landed. It means that he will be able to employ more Ghanaians. It also means that he will be able to generate wealth. And then it will have what economists call external effects on a local economy. All that you need to do, all that the elites need to do, is to move this operation into something that is enclosed so that the operation can be made more efficient.Now, it is not just this informal sector. There is also traditional medicine. 80 percent of Africans still rely on traditional medicine. The modern healthcare sector has totally collapsed. Now, this is an area \u2014 I mean, there is a treasure trove of wealth in the traditional medicine area. This is where we need to mobilize Africans, in the Diaspora especially, to invest in this. We also need to mobilize Africans in the Diaspora, not only to go into the traditional sectors, but to go into agriculture and also to instigate change from within. We were able to mobilize Ghanaians in the Diaspora to instigate change in Ghana and bring about democracy in Ghana. And I know that with the Cheetahs, we can take Africa back one village at a time.

condition of Africa.\n\n00:02:04.958 --> 00:02:08.958\nNow, we're talking about a continent that is not poor.\n\n00:02:08.958 --> 00:02:12.958\nIt is rich in mineral resources, natural mineral resources.\n\n00:02:13.958 --> 00:02:17.958\nBut the mineral wealth of Africa is not being utilized\n\n00:02:17.958 --> 00:02:19.958\nto lift its people out of poverty.\n\n00:02:20.958 --> 00:02:23.958\nThat's what makes a lot of Africans very angry.\n\n00:02:24.958 --> 00:02:29.958\nAnd in a way, Africa is more than a tragedy, in more ways than one.\n\n00:02:30.958 --> 00:02:34.958\nThere's another enduring tragedy, and that tragedy is that\n\n00:02:34.958 --> 00:02:37.958\nthere are so many people, so many governments,\n\n00:02:37.958 --> 00:02:41.958\nso many organizations who want to help the people in Africa.\n\n00:02:41.958 --> 00:02:43.958\nThey don't understand.\n\n00:02:45.958 --> 00:02:47.958\nNow, we're not saying don't help Africa.\n\n00:02:47.958 --> 00:02:49.958\nHelping Africa is noble.\n\n00:02:50.958 --> 00:02:56.958\nBut helping Africa has been turned into a theater of the absurd.\n\n00:02:56.958 --> 00:03:00.958\nIt's like the blind leading the clueless.\n\n00:03:00.958 --> 00:03:02.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:03:03.958 --> 00:03:06.958\nThere are certain things that we need to recognize.\n\n00:03:07.958 --> 00:03:10.958\nAfrica's begging-bowl leaks.\n\n00:03:11.958 --> 00:03:14.958\nDid you know that 40 percent of the wealth created in Africa\n\n00:03:14.958 --> 00:03:16.958\nis not invested here in Africa?\n\n00:03:16.958 --> 00:03:18.958\nIt's taken out of Africa.\n\n00:03:18.958 --> 00:03:20.958\nThat's what the World Bank says.\n\n00:03:22.958 --> 00:03:24.958\nLook at Africa's begging-bowl.\n\n00:03:25.958 --> 00:03:27.958\nIt leaks horribly.\n\n00:03:28.958 --> 00:03:31.958\nThere are people who think that we should pour more money,\n\n00:03:31.958 --> 00:03:35.958\nmore aid into this bowl which leaks.\n\n00:03:36.958 --> 00:03:38.958\nWhat are the leakages?\n\n00:03:39.958 --> 00:03:44.958\nCorruption alone costs Africa 148 billion dollars a year.\n\n00:03:46.958 --> 00:03:48.958\nYes, put that aside.\n\n00:03:49.958 --> 00:03:53.958\nCapital flight out of Africa, 80 billion a year.\n\n00:03:54.958 --> 00:03:56.958\nPut that aside.\n\n00:03:57.958 --> 00:03:59.958\nLet's take food imports.\n\n00:03:59.958 --> 00:04:04.958\nEvery year Africa spends 20 billion dollars to import food.\n\n00:04:06.958 --> 00:04:09.958\nJust add that up, all these leakages.\n\n00:04:09.958 --> 00:04:13.958\nThat's far more than the 50 billion Tony Blair wants to raise for Africa.\n\n00:04:14.958 --> 00:04:17.958\nNow, back in the 1960s Africa not only fed itself,\n\n00:04:17.958 --> 00:04:19.958\nit also exported food.\n\n00:04:19.958 --> 00:04:21.958\nNot anymore.\n\n00:04:22.958 --> 00:04:25.958\nWe know that something has gone fundamentally wrong.\n\n00:04:26.958 --> 00:04:29.958\nYou know it, I know it, but let's not waste our time\n\n00:04:29.958 --> 00:04:34.958\ntalking about these mistakes because we'll spend all day here.\n\n00:04:34.958 --> 00:04:40.958\nLet's move on, and flip over to the next chapter,\n\n00:04:40.958 --> 00:04:44.958\nand that's what this conference is all about -- the next chapter.\n\n00:04:44.958 --> 00:04:49.958\nThe next chapter begins with first of all, asking ourselves\n\n00:04:49.958 --> 00:04:51.958\nthis fundamental question,\n\n00:04:51.958 --> 00:04:55.958\n\"Whom do we want to help in Africa?\"\n\n00:04:56.958 --> 00:05:01.958\nThere is the people, and then there is the government or leaders.\n\n00:05:02.958 --> 00:05:09.958\nNow, the previous speaker before me,\n\n00:05:09.958 --> 00:05:13.958\nIdris Mohammed, indicated that\n\n00:05:14.958 --> 00:05:18.958\nwe've had abysmal leadership in Africa.\n\n00:05:19.958 --> 00:05:23.958\nThat characterization, in my view, is even more charitable.\n\n00:05:24.958 --> 00:05:26.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:05:28.958 --> 00:05:31.958\nI belong to an Internet discussion forum,\n\n00:05:31.958 --> 00:05:34.958\nan African Internet discussion forum,\n\n00:05:35.958 --> 00:05:41.958\nand I asked them, I said, \"Since 1960, we've had exactly\n\n00:05:41.958 --> 00:05:45.958\n204 African heads of state, since 1960.\"\n\n00:05:45.958 --> 00:05:49.958\nAnd I asked them to name me just 20 good leaders,\n\n00:05:49.958 --> 00:05:52.958\njust 20 good leaders --\n\n00:05:52.958 --> 00:05:57.958\nyou may want to take this leadership challenge yourself.\n\n00:05:57.958 --> 00:05:59.958\nI asked them to name me just 20.\n\n00:06:00.958 --> 00:06:03.958\nEverybody mentioned Nelson Mandela, of course.\n\n00:06:03.958 --> 00:06:09.958\nKwame Nkrumah, Nyerere, Kenyatta -- somebody mentioned Idi Amin.\n\n00:06:10.958 --> 00:06:13.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:06:13.958 --> 00:06:15.958\nI let that pass.\n\n00:06:15.958 --> 00:06:17.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:06:18.958 --> 00:06:22.958\nMy point is, they couldn't go beyond 15.\n\n00:06:24.958 --> 00:06:27.958\nEven if they had been able to name me 20,\n\n00:06:27.958 --> 00:06:29.958\nwhat does that tell you?\n\n00:06:29.958 --> 00:06:36.958\n20 out of 204 means that the vast majority\n\n00:06:36.958 --> 00:06:39.958\nof the African leaders failed their people.\n\n00:06:41.958 --> 00:06:46.958\nAnd if you look at them, the slate of the post-colonial leaders --\n\n00:06:47.958 --> 00:06:51.958\nan assortment of military fufu heads,\n\n00:06:51.958 --> 00:06:56.958\nSwiss-bank socialists, crocodile liberators, vampire elites,\n\n00:06:56.958 --> 00:06:57.958\nquack revolutionaries.\n\n00:06:57.958 --> 00:07:01.958\n(Applause)\n\n00:07:01.958 --> 00:07:05.958\nNow, this leadership is a far cry from the traditional leaders\n\n00:07:05.958 --> 00:07:07.958\nthat Africans have known for centuries.\n\n00:07:08.958 --> 00:07:11.958\nThe second false premise that we make\n\n00:07:11.958 --> 00:07:12.958\nwhen we're trying to help Africa\n\n00:07:12.958 --> 00:07:18.958\nis that sometimes we think that there is something called\n\n00:07:18.958 --> 00:07:23.958\na government in Africa that cares about its people,\n\n00:07:24.958 --> 00:07:28.958\nserves the interests of the people, and represents the people.\n\n00:07:30.958 --> 00:07:35.958\nThere is one particular quote -- a Lesotho chief once said\n\n00:07:35.958 --> 00:07:37.958\nthat \"Here in Lesotho, we've got two problems:\n\n00:07:37.958 --> 00:07:40.958\nrats and the government.\"\n\n00:07:40.958 --> 00:07:43.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:07:44.958 --> 00:07:47.958\nWhat you and I understand as a government\n\n00:07:47.958 --> 00:07:50.958\ndoesn't exist in many African countries.\n\n00:07:50.958 --> 00:07:54.958\nIn fact, what we call our governments are vampire states.\n\n00:07:55.958 --> 00:07:58.958\nVampires because they suck\n\n00:07:58.958 --> 00:08:01.958\nthe economic vitality out of their people.\n\n00:08:01.958 --> 00:08:04.958\nGovernment is the problem in Africa.\n\n00:08:05.958 --> 00:08:08.958\nA vampire state is the government --\n\n00:08:08.958 --> 00:08:09.958\n(Applause)\n\n00:08:09.958 --> 00:08:13.958\n-- which has been hijacked by a phalanx of bandits and crooks\n\n00:08:13.958 --> 00:08:16.958\nwho use the instruments of state power to enrich themselves,\n\n00:08:16.958 --> 00:08:19.958\ntheir cronies, and tribesmen and exclude everybody else.\n\n00:08:21.958 --> 00:08:25.958\nThe richest people in Africa are heads-of-state and ministers,\n\n00:08:25.958 --> 00:08:29.958\nand quite often the chief bandit is the head-of-state himself.\n\n00:08:31.958 --> 00:08:33.958\nWhere do they get their money?\n\n00:08:33.958 --> 00:08:35.958\nBy creating wealth?\n\n00:08:35.958 --> 00:08:36.958\nNo.\n\n00:08:36.958 --> 00:08:39.958\nBy raking it off the backs of their suffering people.\n\n00:08:40.958 --> 00:08:44.958\nThat's not wealth creation. It's wealth redistribution.\n\n00:08:46.958 --> 00:08:51.958\nThe third fundamental issue that we have to recognize\n\n00:08:51.958 --> 00:08:56.958\nis that if we want to help the African people,\n\n00:08:56.958 --> 00:08:59.958\nwe must know where the African people are.\n\n00:08:59.958 --> 00:09:01.958\nTake any African economy.\n\n00:09:02.958 --> 00:09:05.958\nAn African economy can be broken up into three sectors.\n\n00:09:05.958 --> 00:09:10.958\nThere is the modern sector, there is the informal sector\n\n00:09:11.958 --> 00:09:14.958\nand the traditional sector.\n\n00:09:15.958 --> 00:09:18.958\nThe modern sector is the abode of the elites.\n\n00:09:18.958 --> 00:09:20.958\nIt's the seat of government.\n\n00:09:21.958 --> 00:09:25.958\nIn many African countries the modern sector is lost.\n\n00:09:25.958 --> 00:09:27.958\nIt's dysfunctional.\n\n00:09:27.958 --> 00:09:31.958\nIt is a meretricious fandango of imported systems,\n\n00:09:31.958 --> 00:09:33.958\nwhich the elites themselves don't understand.\n\n00:09:35.958 --> 00:09:39.958\nThat is the source of many of Africa's problems\n\n00:09:39.958 --> 00:09:43.958\nwhere the struggles for political power emanate\n\n00:09:43.958 --> 00:09:48.958\nand then spill over onto the informal and the traditional sector,\n\n00:09:48.958 --> 00:09:51.958\nclaiming innocent lives.\n\n00:09:52.958 --> 00:09:54.958\nNow the modern sector, of course,\n\n00:09:54.958 --> 00:09:59.958\nis where a lot of the development aid and resources went into.\n\n00:10:00.958 --> 00:10:03.958\nMore than 80 percent of Ivory Coast's development\n\n00:10:03.958 --> 00:10:05.958\nwent into the modern sector.\n\n00:10:05.958 --> 00:10:11.958\nThe other sectors, the informal and the traditional sectors,\n\n00:10:11.958 --> 00:10:15.958\nare where you find the majority of the African people,\n\n00:10:15.958 --> 00:10:18.958\nthe real people in Africa. That's where you find them.\n\n00:10:18.958 --> 00:10:20.958\nNow, obviously it makes common sense\n\n00:10:20.958 --> 00:10:23.958\nthat if you want to help the people, you go where the people are.\n\n00:10:23.958 --> 00:10:25.958\nBut that's not what we did.\n\n00:10:25.958 --> 00:10:27.958\nAs a matter of fact,\n\n00:10:27.958 --> 00:10:34.958\nwe neglected the informal and the traditional sectors.\n\n00:10:34.958 --> 00:10:37.958\nNow, traditional sector is where Africa produces its agriculture,\n\n00:10:38.958 --> 00:10:41.958\nwhich is one of the reasons why Africa can't feed itself,\n\n00:10:41.958 --> 00:10:44.958\nand that's why it must import food.\n\n00:10:45.958 --> 00:10:49.958\nAll right, you cannot develop Africa by ignoring\n\n00:10:49.958 --> 00:10:52.958\nthe informal and the traditional sectors.\n\n00:10:53.958 --> 00:10:59.958\nAnd you can't develop the informal and the traditional sectors\n\n00:10:59.958 --> 00:11:03.958\nwithout an operational understanding of how these two sectors work.\n\n00:11:05.958 --> 00:11:07.958\nThese two sectors, let me describe to you,\n\n00:11:07.958 --> 00:11:10.958\nhave their own indigenous institutions.\n\n00:11:10.958 --> 00:11:13.958\nFirst one is the political system.\n\n00:11:14.958 --> 00:11:18.958\nTraditionally, Africans hate governments. They hate tyranny.\n\n00:11:18.958 --> 00:11:21.958\nIf you look into their traditional systems,\n\n00:11:21.958 --> 00:11:25.958\nAfricans organize their states in two types.\n\n00:11:25.958 --> 00:11:30.958\nThe first one belongs to those ethnic societies\n\n00:11:30.958 --> 00:11:34.958\nwho believe that the state was necessarily tyrannous,\n\n00:11:34.958 --> 00:11:37.958\nso they didn't want to have anything to do\n\n00:11:37.958 --> 00:11:39.958\nwith any centralized authority.\n\n00:11:42.958 --> 00:11:45.958\nThese societies are the Ibo, the Somali, the Kikuyus,\n\n00:11:45.958 --> 00:11:47.958\nfor example. They have no chiefs.\n\n00:11:48.958 --> 00:11:52.958\nThe other ethnic groups, which did have chiefs,\n\n00:11:52.958 --> 00:11:56.958\nmade sure that they surrounded the chiefs\n\n00:11:56.958 --> 00:11:59.958\nwith councils upon councils upon councils\n\n00:11:59.958 --> 00:12:02.958\nto prevent them from abusing their power.\n\n00:12:04.958 --> 00:12:07.958\nIn Ashanti tradition, for example,\n\n00:12:07.958 --> 00:12:09.958\nthe chief cannot make any decision\n\n00:12:09.958 --> 00:12:12.958\nwithout the concurrence of the council of elders.\n\n00:12:12.958 --> 00:12:15.958\nWithout the council the chief can't pass any law,\n\n00:12:15.958 --> 00:12:18.958\nand if the chief doesn't govern according to the will of the people\n\n00:12:18.958 --> 00:12:20.958\nhe will be removed.\n\n00:12:20.958 --> 00:12:24.958\nIf not, the people will abandon the chief,\n\n00:12:24.958 --> 00:12:26.958\ngo somewhere else and set up a new settlement.\n\n00:12:26.958 --> 00:12:30.958\nAnd even if you look in ancient African empires,\n\n00:12:30.958 --> 00:12:35.958\nthey were all organized around one particular principle --\n\n00:12:35.958 --> 00:12:37.958\nthe confederacy principle,\n\n00:12:37.958 --> 00:12:41.958\nwhich is characterized by a great deal of devolution of authority,\n\n00:12:41.958 --> 00:12:43.958\ndecentralization of power.\n\n00:12:44.958 --> 00:12:46.958\nNow, this is what I have described to you.\n\n00:12:46.958 --> 00:12:50.958\nThis is part of Africa's indigenous political heritage.\n\n00:12:50.958 --> 00:12:52.958\nNow, compare that to the modern systems\n\n00:12:52.958 --> 00:12:56.958\nthe ruling elites established on Africa.\n\n00:12:56.958 --> 00:12:59.958\nIt is a total far cry.\n\n00:12:59.958 --> 00:13:04.958\nIn the economic system in traditional Africa,\n\n00:13:04.958 --> 00:13:07.958\nthe means of production is privately owned.\n\n00:13:07.958 --> 00:13:10.958\nIt's owned by extended families.\n\n00:13:10.958 --> 00:13:13.958\nYou see, in the West, the basic economic and social unit\n\n00:13:13.958 --> 00:13:15.958\nis the individual.\n\n00:13:15.958 --> 00:13:18.958\nThe American will say, \"I am because I am,\n\n00:13:18.958 --> 00:13:20.958\nand I can damn well do anything I want, anytime.\"\n\n00:13:20.958 --> 00:13:23.958\nThe accent is on the \"I.\"\n\n00:13:23.958 --> 00:13:27.958\nIn Africa, the Africans say, \"I am, because we are.\"\n\n00:13:27.958 --> 00:13:31.958\nThe \"we\" connotes community -- the extended family system.\n\n00:13:31.958 --> 00:13:34.958\nThe extended family system pools its resources together.\n\n00:13:34.958 --> 00:13:38.958\nThey own farms. They decide what to do, what to produce.\n\n00:13:38.958 --> 00:13:41.958\nThey don't take any orders from their chiefs.\n\n00:13:41.958 --> 00:13:43.958\nThey decide what to do.\n\n00:13:43.958 --> 00:13:47.958\nAnd when they produce their crops, they sell the surplus\n\n00:13:47.958 --> 00:13:49.958\non marketplaces.\n\n00:13:49.958 --> 00:13:51.958\nWhen they make a profit it is theirs to keep,\n\n00:13:51.958 --> 00:13:54.958\nnot for the chief to sequester it from them.\n\n00:13:54.958 --> 00:13:58.958\nSo, in a nutshell, what we had in traditional Africa\n\n00:13:58.958 --> 00:14:00.958\nwas a free-market system.\n\n00:14:00.958 --> 00:14:02.958\nThere were markets in Africa\n\n00:14:02.958 --> 00:14:04.958\nbefore the colonialists stepped foot on the continent.\n\n00:14:04.958 --> 00:14:06.958\nTimbuktu was one great big market town.\n\n00:14:06.958 --> 00:14:08.958\nKano, Salaga -- they were all there.\n\n00:14:08.958 --> 00:14:12.958\nEven if you go to West Africa, you notice that market activity\n\n00:14:12.958 --> 00:14:15.958\nin West Africa has always been dominated by women.\n\n00:14:15.958 --> 00:14:18.958\nSo, it's quite appropriate that this section is called\n\n00:14:18.958 --> 00:14:19.958\na marketplace.\n\n00:14:19.958 --> 00:14:21.958\nThe market is not alien to Africa.\n\n00:14:22.958 --> 00:14:26.958\nWhat Africans practiced was a different form of capitalism,\n\n00:14:26.958 --> 00:14:29.958\nbut then after independence, all of a sudden,\n\n00:14:29.958 --> 00:14:33.958\nmarkets, capitalism became a western institution,\n\n00:14:33.958 --> 00:14:38.958\nand the leaders said Africans were ready for socialism.\n\n00:14:38.958 --> 00:14:39.958\nNonsense.\n\n00:14:40.958 --> 00:14:43.958\nAnd even then, what kind of socialism did they practice?\n\n00:14:43.958 --> 00:14:46.958\nThe socialism that they practiced was a peculiar form of\n\n00:14:46.958 --> 00:14:48.958\nSwiss-bank socialism,\n\n00:14:48.958 --> 00:14:51.958\nwhich allowed the heads of states and the ministers\n\n00:14:51.958 --> 00:14:54.958\nto rape and plunder Africa's\n\n00:14:54.958 --> 00:14:56.958\ntreasuries for deposit in Switzerland.\n\n00:14:56.958 --> 00:15:00.958\nThat is not the kind of system Africans had known for centuries.\n\n00:15:00.958 --> 00:15:01.958\nWhat do we do now?\n\n00:15:01.958 --> 00:15:04.958\nGo back to Africa's indigenous institutions,\n\n00:15:04.958 --> 00:15:09.958\nand this is where we charge the Cheetahs to go into the informal sectors,\n\n00:15:09.958 --> 00:15:10.958\nthe traditional sectors.\n\n00:15:10.958 --> 00:15:12.958\nThat's where you find the African people.\n\n00:15:12.958 --> 00:15:15.958\nAnd I'd like to show you a quick little video\n\n00:15:15.958 --> 00:15:18.958\nabout the informal sector, about the boat-building\n\n00:15:18.958 --> 00:15:23.958\nthat I, myself, tried to mobilize Africans in the Diaspora\n\n00:15:23.958 --> 00:15:24.958\nto invest in.\n\n00:15:24.958 --> 00:15:26.958\nCould you please show that?\n\n00:15:54.958 --> 00:15:57.958\nThe men are going fishing in these small boats.\n\n00:15:57.958 --> 00:15:59.958\nYes, it's an enterprise.\n\n00:15:59.958 --> 00:16:04.958\nThis is by a local Ghanaian entrepreneur, using his own capital.\n\n00:16:04.958 --> 00:16:06.958\nHe's getting no assistance from the government,\n\n00:16:06.958 --> 00:16:09.958\nand he's building a second, bigger boat.\n\n00:16:09.958 --> 00:16:13.958\nA bigger boat will mean more fish will be caught and landed.\n\n00:16:14.958 --> 00:16:17.958\nIt means that he will be able to employ more Ghanaians.\n\n00:16:17.958 --> 00:16:20.958\nIt also means that he will be able to generate wealth.\n\n00:16:21.958 --> 00:16:25.958\nAnd then it will have what economists call\n\n00:16:25.958 --> 00:16:28.958\nexternal effects on a local economy.\n\n00:16:28.958 --> 00:16:31.958\nAll that you need to do, all that the elites need to do,\n\n00:16:31.958 --> 00:16:34.958\nis to move this operation into something that is enclosed\n\n00:16:34.958 --> 00:16:36.958\nso that the operation can be made more efficient.\n\n00:16:37.958 --> 00:16:40.958\nNow, it is not just this informal sector.\n\n00:16:40.958 --> 00:16:44.958\nThere is also traditional medicine.\n\n00:16:44.958 --> 00:16:47.958\n80 percent of Africans still rely on traditional medicine.\n\n00:16:47.958 --> 00:16:51.958\nThe modern healthcare sector has totally collapsed.\n\n00:16:51.958 --> 00:16:58.958\nNow, this is an area -- I mean, there is a treasure trove of wealth\n\n00:16:58.958 --> 00:17:00.958\nin the traditional medicine area.\n\n00:17:00.958 --> 00:17:03.958\nThis is where we need to mobilize Africans,\n\n00:17:03.958 --> 00:17:06.958\nin the Diaspora especially, to invest in this.\n\n00:17:06.958 --> 00:17:09.958\nWe also need to mobilize Africans in the Diaspora,\n\n00:17:09.958 --> 00:17:12.958\nnot only to go into the traditional sectors,\n\n00:17:12.958 --> 00:17:18.958\nbut to go into agriculture and also to instigate change from within.\n\n00:17:18.958 --> 00:17:22.958\nWe were able to mobilize Ghanaians in the Diaspora\n\n00:17:22.958 --> 00:17:27.958\nto instigate change in Ghana and bring about democracy in Ghana.\n\n00:17:27.958 --> 00:17:32.958\nAnd I know that with the Cheetahs, we can take Africa back\n\n00:17:32.958 --> 00:17:34.958\none village at a time.\n\n00:17:34.958 --> 00:17:35.958\nThank you very much.\n\n00:17:35.958 --> 00:17:43.958\n(Applause)"}, {"title": "Aid versus trade", "duration": "1330", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/ngozi_okonjo_iweala_on_aid_versus_trade", "transcript": "It's very, very difficult to speak at the end of a conference like this, because everyone has spoken. Everything has been said. So I thought that what may be useful is to remind us of some of the things that have gone on here, and then maybe offer some ideas which we can take away, and take forward and work on. That's what I'd like to try and do. We came here saying we want to talk about \"Africa: the Next Chapter.\" But we are talking about \"Africa: the Next Chapter\" because we are looking at the old and the present chapter \u2014 that we're looking at, and saying it's not such a good thing. The picture I showed you before, and this picture, of drought, death and disease is what we usually see. What we want to look at is \"Africa: the Next Chapter,\" and that's this: a healthy, smiling, beautiful African. And I think it's worth remembering what we've heard through the conference right from the first day, where I heard that all the important statistics have been given \u2014 about where we are now, about how the continent is doing much better. And the importance of that is that we have a platform to build on.So I'm not going to spend too much time \u2014 just to show you, refresh your memories that we are here for \"Africa: the Next Chapter\" because for the first time there really is a platform to build on. We really do have it going right that the continent is growing at rates that people had thought would not happen. After decades of 2 percent, we are now at 5 percent, and it's going to \u2014 projected \u2014 6 and 7 percent even. And inflation has come down. External debt \u2014 something that I can tell you a long story about because I personally worked on one of the biggest debts on the continent \u2014 has come down dramatically. You know, as you can see, from almost 50 billion down to about 12 or 13 billion. Now this is a huge achievement.You know, we've built up reserves. Why is that important? It's because it shows off our economies, shows off our currencies and gives a platform on which people can plan and build, including businesses. We've also seen some evidence that all this is making a difference because private investment flows have increased. I want to remind you again \u2014 I know you saw these statistics before \u2014 from almost 6 billion we are now at about 18 billion. In 2005, remittances \u2014 I just took one country, Nigeria skyrocketing \u2014 skyrocketing is too dramatic, but increasing dramatically. And in many other countries this is happening. Why is this important? Because it shows confidence. People are now confident to bring \u2014 if your people in the diaspora bring their money back, it shows other people that, look, there is emerging confidence in your country. And instead of an outflow, you are now getting a net inflow.Now, why is all this important, to have to go really fast? It's important that we build this platform, that we have the president, Kikwete, and others of our leaders who are saying, \"Look, we must do something different.\" Because we are confronted with a challenge. 62 percent of our population is below the age of 24. What does this mean? This means that we have to focus on how our youth are going to be engaged in productive endeavor in their lives. You have to focus on how to create jobs, make sure they don't fall into disease, and that they get an education. But most of all that they are productively engaged in life, and that they are creating the kind of productive environment in our countries that will make things happen. And to support this, I just recently \u2014 one of the things I've done since leaving government is to start an opinion research organization in Nigeria. Most of our countries don't even have any opinion research. People don't have voice. There is no way you can know what people want.One of the things we asked them recently was what's their top issue. Like in every other country where this has been done, jobs is the top issue. I want to leave this up here and come back to it. But before I get to this slide, I just wanted to run you through this. And to say that for me, the next stage of building this platform that now enables us to move forward \u2014 and we mustn't make light of it. It was only 5, 6, 7 years ago we couldn't even talk about the next chapter, because we were in the old chapter. We were going nowhere. The economies were not growing. We were having negative per capita growth. The microeconomic framework and foundation for moving forward was not even there. So let's not forget that it's taken a lot to build this, including all those things that we tried to do in Nigeria that Dele referred to. Creating our own program to solve problems, like fighting corruption, building institutions, stabilizing the micro economy.So now we have this platform we can build on. And it brings us to the debate that has been going on here: aid versus private sector, aid versus trade, etc. And someone stood up to say that one of the frustrating things is that it's been a simplistic debate. And that's not what the debate should be about. That's engaging in the wrong debate. The issue here is how do we get a partnership that involves government donors, the private sector and ordinary African people taking charge of their own lives? How do we combine all this? To move our continent forward, to do the things that need doing that I talked about \u2014 getting young people employed. Getting the creative juices flowing on this continent, much of what you have seen here. So I'm afraid we've been engaging a little bit in the wrong debate. We need to bring it back to say, what is the combination of all these factors that is going to yield what we want? (Applause)And I want to tell you something. For me, the issue about aid \u2014 I don't think that Africans need to now go all the way over to the other side and feel bad about aid. Africa has been giving the other countries aid. Mo Ibrahim said at a debate we were at that he dreams one day when Africa will be giving aid. And I said, \"Mo, you're right. We have \u2014 no, but we've already been doing it! The U.K. and the U.S. could not have been built today without Africa's aid.\"(Applause)It is all the resources that were taken from Africa, including human, that built these countries today! So when they try to give back, we shouldn't be on the defensive. The issue is not that. The issue is how are we using what has been given back. How are we using it? Is it being directed effectively? I want to tell you a little story. Why I don't mind if we get aid, but we use it well. From 1967 to '70, Nigeria fought a war \u2014 the Nigeria-Biafra war. And in the middle of that war, I was 14 years old. We spent much of our time with my mother cooking. For the army \u2014 my father joined the army as a brigadier \u2014 the Biafran army. We were on the Biafran side. And we were down to eating one meal a day, running from place to place, but wherever we could help we did. At a certain point in time, in 1969, things were really bad. We were down to almost nothing in terms of a meal a day. People, children were dying of kwashiorkor. I'm sure some of you who are not so young will remember those pictures. Well, I was in the middle of it.In the midst of all this, my mother fell ill with a stomach ailment for two or three days. We thought she was going to die. My father was not there. He was in the army. So I was the oldest person in the house. My sister fell very ill with malaria. She was three years old and I was 15. And she had such a high fever. We tried everything. It didn't look like it was going to work. Until we heard that 10 kilometers away there was a doctor, who was looking at people and giving them meds. Now I put my sister on my back \u2014 burning \u2014 and I walked 10 kilometers with her strapped on my back. It was really hot. I was very hungry. I was scared because I knew her life depended on my getting to this woman. We heard there was a woman doctor who was treating people. I walked 10 kilometers, putting one foot in front of the other. I got there and I saw huge crowds. Almost a thousand people were there, trying to break down the door. She was doing this in a church. How was I going to get in?I had to crawl in between the legs of these people with my sister strapped on my back, find a way to a window. And while they were trying to break down the door, I climbed in through the window, and jumped in. This woman told me it was in the nick of time. By the time we jumped into that hall, she was barely moving. She gave a shot of her chloroquine \u2014 what I learned was the chloroquine then \u2014 gave her some \u2014 it must have been a re-hydration \u2014 and some other therapies, and put us in a corner. In about two to three hours, she started to move. And then they toweled her down because she started sweating, which was a good sign. And then my sister woke up. And about five or six hours later, she said we could go home. I strapped her on my back. I walked the 10 kilometers back and it was the shortest walk I ever had. I was so happy \u2014 (Applause) \u2014 that my sister was alive! Today she's 41 years old, a mother of three, and she's a physician saving other lives.Why am I telling that? I'm telling you that because \u2014 when it is you or your person involved \u2014 you don't care where \u2014 whether it's aid. You don't care what it is! (Applause) You just want the person to be alive! And now let me become less sentimental, and say that saving lives \u2014 which some of the aid we get does on this continent \u2014 when you save the life of anyone, a farmer, a teacher, a mother, they are contributing productively into the economy. And as an economist, we can also look at that side of the story. These are people who are productive agents in the economy. So if we save people from HIV/AIDS, if we save them from malaria, it means they can form the base of production for our economy. And by the same token \u2014 as someone said yesterday \u2014 if we don't and they die, their children will become a burden on the economy. So even from an economic standpoint, if we leave the social and the humanitarian, we need to save lives now. So that's one of the reasons, from a personal experience, that I say let's channel these resources we get into something productive. However, I will also tell you that I'm one of those who doesn't believe that this is the sole answer. That's why I said the debate has to get more sophisticated. You know, we have to use it well.What has happened in Europe? Do you all know that Spain \u2014 part of the EU \u2014 got 10 billion dollars in aid from the rest of the EU? Resources that were transferred to them \u2014 and were the Spanish ashamed of this? No! The EU transferred 10 billion. Where did they use it? Have you been to southern Spain lately? There are roads everywhere. Infrastructure everywhere. It is on the back of this that the whole of southern Spain has developed into a services economy. Did you know that Ireland got 3 billion dollars in aid? Ireland is one of the fastest-growing economies in the European Union today. For which many people, even from other parts of the world, are going there to find jobs. What did they do with the 3 billion dollars in aid? They used it to build an information superhighway, gain infrastructure that enables them to participate in the information technology revolution, and to create jobs in their economy. They didn't say, \"No, you know, we're not going to take this.\" Today, the European Union is busy transferring aid. My frustration is if they can build infrastructure in Spain \u2014 which is roads, highways, other things that they can build \u2014 I say then, why do they refuse to use the same aid to build the same infrastructure in our countries? (Applause)When we ask them and tell them what we need, one of my worries today is that we have many foundations now. Now we talk about the World Bank, IMF, and accountability, all that and the EU. We also have private citizens now who have a lot of money \u2014 some of them in this audience, with private foundations. And one day, these foundations have so much money, they will overtake the official aid that is being given. But I fear \u2014 and I'm very grateful to all of them for what they are trying to do on the continent \u2014 but I'm also worried. I wake up with a gnawing in my belly because I see a new set of aid entrepreneurs on the continent. And they're also going from country to country, and many times trying to find what to do. But I'm not really sure that their assistance is also being channeled in the right way. And many of them are not really familiar with the continent. They are just discovering. And many times I don't see Africans working with them. They are just going alone! (Applause)And many times I get the impression that they are not really even interested in hearing from Africans who might know. They want to visit us, see what's happening on the ground and make a decision. And now I'm maybe being harsh. But I worry because this money is so important. Now, who are they accountable to? Are we on their boards when they make decisions about where to channel money? Are we there? Will we make the same mistake that we made before? Have our presidents and our leaders \u2014 everyone is talking about \u2014 have they ever called these people together and said, \"Look, your foundation and your foundation \u2014 you have so much money, we are grateful. Let's sit down and really tell you where the money should be channeled and where this aid should go.\" Have we done that? The answer is no. And each one is making their own individual effort. And then 10 years from now, billions will again have gone into Africa, and we would still have the same problems.This is what gives us the hopeless image. Our inability to take charge and say to all these people bringing their money, \"Sit down.\" And we don't do it because there are so many of us. We don't coordinate. We've not called the Bill Gates, and the Soros, and everybody else who is helping and say, \"Sit down. Let's have a conference with you. As a continent, here are our priorities. Here is where we want you to channel this money.\" Each one should not be an entrepreneur going out and finding what is best. We're not trying to stop them at all! But to help them help us better. And what is disappointing me is that we are not doing this. Ten years from now we will have the same story, and we will be repeating the same things. So our problem right now is, how can we leverage all this good will that is coming towards our way? How can we get government to combine properly with these private foundations, with the international organizations, and with our private sector.I firmly believe in that private sector thing too. But it cannot do it alone. So there might be a few ideas we could think of that could work. They said this is about proliferating and sharing ideas. So why don't we think of using some of this aid? Well, why don't we first say to those helping us out, \"Don't be shy about infrastructure. That health that you're working on cannot be sustainable without infrastructure. That education will work better if we've got electricity and railroads, and so on. That agriculture will work better if there are railroads to get the goods to market. Don't be shy of it. Invest some of your resources in that, too.\" And then we can see that this is one combination of private, international, multilateral money, private sector and the African that we can put together as a partnership, so that aid can be a facilitator. That is all aid can be. Aid cannot solve our problems, I'm firmly convinced about that. But it can be catalytic. And if we fail to use it as catalytic, we would have failed.One of the reasons why China is a bit popular with Africans now \u2014 one of the reasons is not only just that, you know, these people are stupid and China is coming to take resources. It's because there's a little more leverage in terms of the Chinese. If you tell them, \"We need a road here,\" they will help you build it. They don't shy away from infrastructure. In fact, the Chinese minister of finance said to me, when I asked him what are we doing wrong in Nigeria. He said, \"There are two things you need only. Infrastructure, infrastructure, infrastructure and discipline. You are undisciplined.\" (Applause) And I repeat it for the continent. It's the same. We need infrastructure, infrastructure and discipline. So we can make a catalytic to help us provide some of that. Now I realize \u2014 I'm not saying \u2014 health and education \u2014 no, you can also provide that as well. But I'm saying it's not either or. Let's see how aid can be a facilitator in partnership. One idea. Second thing, for the private sector, people are afraid to take risks on the continent. Why can't some of this aid be used as a kind of guarantee mechanisms, to enable people to take risk?(Applause)And finally, because they are both standing at my \u2014 I'm out of time. Am I out of time? OK, so let me not forget my punchline. One of the things I want everybody to collaborate on is to support women, to create jobs. (Applause) A lot has been said here about women, I don't need to repeat it. But there are people \u2014 women \u2014 creating jobs. And we know, studies have shown that when you put resources in the hand of the woman \u2014 in fact, there's an econometric study, the World Bank Review, done in 2000, showing that transfers into the hands of women result in healthier children, more for the household, more for the economy and all that. So I'm saying that one of the takeaways from here \u2014 I'm not saying the men are not important \u2014 obviously, if you leave the husbands out, what will they do? They'll come back home and get disgruntled, and it will result in difficulties we don't want. We don't want men beating their wives because they don't have a job, and so on.But at the margin, we also \u2014 I want to push this, because the reason is the men automatically \u2014 they get \u2014 not automatically, but they tend to get more support. But I want you to realize that resources in the hands of African women is a powerful tool. There are people creating jobs. Beatrice Gakuba has created 200 jobs from her flower business in Rwanda. We have Ibukun Awosika in Nigeria, with the chair company. She wants to expand. She needs another 20 million. She will create another 100, 200 more jobs. So take away from here is how are you going to put together the resources to put money in the hands of women in the middle who are ready \u2014 business people who want to expand and create more jobs. And lastly, what are you going to do to be part of this partnership of aid, government, private sector and the African as an individual? Thank you.

Everything has been said.\n\n00:00:23.958 --> 00:00:26.958\nSo I thought that what may be useful is to remind us\n\n00:00:27.958 --> 00:00:30.958\nof some of the things that have gone on here,\n\n00:00:30.958 --> 00:00:33.958\nand then maybe offer some ideas which we can take away,\n\n00:00:33.958 --> 00:00:37.958\nand take forward and work on.\n\n00:00:38.958 --> 00:00:39.958\nThat's what I'd like to try and do.\n\n00:00:39.958 --> 00:00:44.958\nWe came here saying we want to talk about \"Africa: the Next Chapter.\"\n\n00:00:44.958 --> 00:00:46.958\nBut we are talking about \"Africa: the Next Chapter\"\n\n00:00:46.958 --> 00:00:52.958\nbecause we are looking at the old and the present chapter -- that we're looking at,\n\n00:00:52.958 --> 00:00:54.958\nand saying it's not such a good thing.\n\n00:00:55.958 --> 00:00:58.958\nThe picture I showed you before, and this picture, of drought, death and disease\n\n00:00:58.958 --> 00:01:02.958\nis what we usually see.\n\n00:01:02.958 --> 00:01:05.958\nWhat we want to look at is \"Africa: the Next Chapter,\"\n\n00:01:06.958 --> 00:01:10.958\nand that's this: a healthy, smiling, beautiful African.\n\n00:01:10.958 --> 00:01:13.958\nAnd I think it's worth remembering what we've heard\n\n00:01:13.958 --> 00:01:15.958\nthrough the conference right from the first day,\n\n00:01:15.958 --> 00:01:18.958\nwhere I heard that all the important statistics have been given --\n\n00:01:18.958 --> 00:01:21.958\nabout where we are now,\n\n00:01:21.958 --> 00:01:24.958\nabout how the continent is doing much better.\n\n00:01:25.958 --> 00:01:27.958\nAnd the importance of that is that we have a platform to build on.\n\n00:01:28.958 --> 00:01:30.958\nSo I'm not going to spend too much time --\n\n00:01:31.958 --> 00:01:34.958\njust to show you, refresh your memories\n\n00:01:34.958 --> 00:01:36.958\nthat we are here for \"Africa: the Next Chapter\" because for the first time\n\n00:01:36.958 --> 00:01:40.958\nthere really is a platform to build on.\n\n00:01:40.958 --> 00:01:43.958\nWe really do have it going right\n\n00:01:43.958 --> 00:01:46.958\nthat the continent is growing at rates that people had thought would not happen.\n\n00:01:47.958 --> 00:01:50.958\nAfter decades of 2 percent, we are now at 5 percent,\n\n00:01:50.958 --> 00:01:53.958\nand it's going to -- projected -- 6 and 7 percent even.\n\n00:01:54.958 --> 00:01:57.958\nAnd inflation has come down.\n\n00:01:58.958 --> 00:02:00.958\nExternal debt -- something that I can tell you a long story about\n\n00:02:00.958 --> 00:02:04.958\nbecause I personally worked on one of the biggest debts on the continent --\n\n00:02:04.958 --> 00:02:06.958\nhas come down dramatically.\n\n00:02:07.958 --> 00:02:09.958\nYou know, as you can see,\n\n00:02:09.958 --> 00:02:12.958\nfrom almost 50 billion down to about 12 or 13 billion.\n\n00:02:12.958 --> 00:02:15.958\nNow this is a huge achievement.\n\n00:02:15.958 --> 00:02:19.958\nYou know, we've built up reserves. Why is that important?\n\n00:02:19.958 --> 00:02:22.958\nIt's because it shows off our economies, shows off our currencies\n\n00:02:22.958 --> 00:02:27.958\nand gives a platform on which people can plan and build, including businesses.\n\n00:02:27.958 --> 00:02:31.958\nWe've also seen some evidence that all this is making a difference\n\n00:02:31.958 --> 00:02:34.958\nbecause private investment flows have increased.\n\n00:02:34.958 --> 00:02:36.958\nI want to remind you again --\n\n00:02:36.958 --> 00:02:39.958\nI know you saw these statistics before --\n\n00:02:39.958 --> 00:02:41.958\nfrom almost 6 billion we are now at about 18 billion.\n\n00:02:42.958 --> 00:02:45.958\nIn 2005, remittances -- I just took one country, Nigeria\n\n00:02:45.958 --> 00:02:49.958\nskyrocketing -- skyrocketing is too dramatic,\n\n00:02:50.958 --> 00:02:53.958\nbut increasing dramatically.\n\n00:02:53.958 --> 00:02:55.958\nAnd in many other countries this is happening.\n\n00:02:55.958 --> 00:02:57.958\nWhy is this important? Because it shows confidence.\n\n00:02:57.958 --> 00:03:00.958\nPeople are now confident to bring --\n\n00:03:00.958 --> 00:03:03.958\nif your people in the diaspora bring their money back,\n\n00:03:03.958 --> 00:03:05.958\nit shows other people that, look,\n\n00:03:05.958 --> 00:03:08.958\nthere is emerging confidence in your country.\n\n00:03:08.958 --> 00:03:11.958\nAnd instead of an outflow, you are now getting a net inflow.\n\n00:03:11.958 --> 00:03:13.958\nNow, why is all this important, to have to go really fast?\n\n00:03:13.958 --> 00:03:16.958\nIt's important that we build this platform,\n\n00:03:16.958 --> 00:03:19.958\nthat we have the president, Kikwete, and others of our leaders who are saying,\n\n00:03:19.958 --> 00:03:21.958\n\"Look, we must do something different.\"\n\n00:03:21.958 --> 00:03:23.958\nBecause we are confronted with a challenge.\n\n00:03:23.958 --> 00:03:30.958\n62 percent of our population is below the age of 24.\n\n00:03:30.958 --> 00:03:33.958\nWhat does this mean?\n\n00:03:33.958 --> 00:03:36.958\nThis means that we have to focus on how our youth\n\n00:03:36.958 --> 00:03:38.958\nare going to be engaged in productive endeavor in their lives.\n\n00:03:39.958 --> 00:03:41.958\nYou have to focus on how to create jobs,\n\n00:03:42.958 --> 00:03:44.958\nmake sure they don't fall into disease, and that they get an education.\n\n00:03:44.958 --> 00:03:47.958\nBut most of all that they are productively engaged in life,\n\n00:03:47.958 --> 00:03:50.958\nand that they are creating the kind of productive environment\n\n00:03:50.958 --> 00:03:54.958\nin our countries that will make things happen.\n\n00:03:54.958 --> 00:03:57.958\nAnd to support this, I just recently --\n\n00:03:57.958 --> 00:03:58.958\none of the things I've done since leaving government\n\n00:03:59.958 --> 00:04:01.958\nis to start an opinion research organization in Nigeria.\n\n00:04:01.958 --> 00:04:04.958\nMost of our countries don't even have any opinion research.\n\n00:04:05.958 --> 00:04:07.958\nPeople don't have voice.\n\n00:04:07.958 --> 00:04:09.958\nThere is no way you can know what people want.\n\n00:04:09.958 --> 00:04:11.958\nOne of the things we asked them recently was what's their top issue.\n\n00:04:11.958 --> 00:04:14.958\nLike in every other country where this has been done,\n\n00:04:14.958 --> 00:04:18.958\njobs is the top issue.\n\n00:04:18.958 --> 00:04:21.958\nI want to leave this up here and come back to it.\n\n00:04:23.958 --> 00:04:27.958\nBut before I get to this slide, I just wanted to run you through this.\n\n00:04:27.958 --> 00:04:30.958\nAnd to say that for me, the next stage of building this platform\n\n00:04:30.958 --> 00:04:33.958\nthat now enables us to move forward --\n\n00:04:33.958 --> 00:04:35.958\nand we mustn't make light of it.\n\n00:04:35.958 --> 00:04:40.958\nIt was only 5, 6, 7 years ago\n\n00:04:40.958 --> 00:04:44.958\nwe couldn't even talk about the next chapter, because we were in the old chapter.\n\n00:04:44.958 --> 00:04:46.958\nWe were going nowhere.\n\n00:04:47.958 --> 00:04:49.958\nThe economies were not growing.\n\n00:04:49.958 --> 00:04:53.958\nWe were having negative per capita growth.\n\n00:04:53.958 --> 00:04:55.958\nThe microeconomic framework and foundation for moving forward\n\n00:04:55.958 --> 00:04:58.958\nwas not even there.\n\n00:04:59.958 --> 00:05:01.958\nSo let's not forget that it's taken a lot to build this,\n\n00:05:02.958 --> 00:05:04.958\nincluding all those things that we tried to do in Nigeria that Dele referred to.\n\n00:05:04.958 --> 00:05:07.958\nCreating our own program to solve problems, like fighting corruption,\n\n00:05:11.958 --> 00:05:15.958\nbuilding institutions, stabilizing the micro economy.\n\n00:05:16.958 --> 00:05:19.958\nSo now we have this platform we can build on.\n\n00:05:20.958 --> 00:05:24.958\nAnd it brings us to the debate that has been going on here:\n\n00:05:24.958 --> 00:05:29.958\naid versus private sector, aid versus trade, etc.\n\n00:05:29.958 --> 00:05:33.958\nAnd someone stood up to say that one of the frustrating things\n\n00:05:34.958 --> 00:05:36.958\nis that it's been a simplistic debate.\n\n00:05:36.958 --> 00:05:41.958\nAnd that's not what the debate should be about.\n\n00:05:41.958 --> 00:05:44.958\nThat's engaging in the wrong debate.\n\n00:05:45.958 --> 00:05:47.958\nThe issue here is how do we get a partnership that involves government donors,\n\n00:05:47.958 --> 00:05:51.958\nthe private sector and ordinary African people\n\n00:05:51.958 --> 00:05:54.958\ntaking charge of their own lives?\n\n00:05:54.958 --> 00:05:59.958\nHow do we combine all this?\n\n00:05:59.958 --> 00:06:01.958\nTo move our continent forward, to do the things that need doing\n\n00:06:01.958 --> 00:06:03.958\nthat I talked about -- getting young people employed.\n\n00:06:04.958 --> 00:06:07.958\nGetting the creative juices flowing on this continent,\n\n00:06:07.958 --> 00:06:10.958\nmuch of what you have seen here.\n\n00:06:10.958 --> 00:06:12.958\nSo I'm afraid we've been engaging a little bit in the wrong debate.\n\n00:06:13.958 --> 00:06:15.958\nWe need to bring it back to say,\n\n00:06:15.958 --> 00:06:18.958\nwhat is the combination of all these factors\n\n00:06:18.958 --> 00:06:22.958\nthat is going to yield what we want? (Applause)\n\n00:06:22.958 --> 00:06:27.958\nAnd I want to tell you something.\n\n00:06:27.958 --> 00:06:30.958\nFor me, the issue about aid --\n\n00:06:30.958 --> 00:06:34.958\nI don't think that Africans need to now go all the way over to the other side\n\n00:06:34.958 --> 00:06:37.958\nand feel bad about aid.\n\n00:06:37.958 --> 00:06:38.958\nAfrica has been giving the other countries aid.\n\n00:06:40.958 --> 00:06:44.958\nMo Ibrahim said at a debate we were at that\n\n00:06:45.958 --> 00:06:47.958\nhe dreams one day when Africa will be giving aid.\n\n00:06:47.958 --> 00:06:50.958\nAnd I said, \"Mo, you're right. We have -- no, but we've already been doing it!\n\n00:06:50.958 --> 00:06:56.958\nThe U.K. and the U.S. could not have been built today without Africa's aid.\"\n\n00:06:56.958 --> 00:07:04.958\n(Applause)\n\n00:07:04.958 --> 00:07:07.958\nIt is all the resources that were taken from Africa,\n\n00:07:07.958 --> 00:07:10.958\nincluding human, that built these countries today!\n\n00:07:11.958 --> 00:07:16.958\nSo when they try to give back, we shouldn't be on the defensive.\n\n00:07:17.958 --> 00:07:20.958\nThe issue is not that.\n\n00:07:20.958 --> 00:07:24.958\nThe issue is how are we using what has been given back.\n\n00:07:24.958 --> 00:07:27.958\nHow are we using it?\n\n00:07:27.958 --> 00:07:30.958\nIs it being directed effectively?\n\n00:07:32.958 --> 00:07:35.958\nI want to tell you a little story.\n\n00:07:35.958 --> 00:07:44.958\nWhy I don't mind if we get aid, but we use it well.\n\n00:07:44.958 --> 00:07:46.958\nFrom 1967 to '70, Nigeria fought a war -- the Nigeria-Biafra war.\n\n00:07:47.958 --> 00:07:50.958\nAnd in the middle of that war, I was 14 years old.\n\n00:07:51.958 --> 00:07:53.958\nWe spent much of our time with my mother cooking.\n\n00:07:53.958 --> 00:07:56.958\nFor the army -- my father joined the army as a brigadier -- the Biafran army.\n\n00:07:56.958 --> 00:07:58.958\nWe were on the Biafran side.\n\n00:07:58.958 --> 00:08:01.958\nAnd we were down to eating one meal a day, running from place to place,\n\n00:08:01.958 --> 00:08:03.958\nbut wherever we could help we did.\n\n00:08:05.958 --> 00:08:09.958\nAt a certain point in time, in 1969, things were really bad.\n\n00:08:09.958 --> 00:08:13.958\nWe were down to almost nothing in terms of a meal a day.\n\n00:08:13.958 --> 00:08:15.958\nPeople, children were dying of kwashiorkor.\n\n00:08:15.958 --> 00:08:17.958\nI'm sure some of you who are not so young\n\n00:08:17.958 --> 00:08:20.958\nwill remember those pictures.\n\n00:08:20.958 --> 00:08:22.958\nWell, I was in the middle of it.\n\n00:08:22.958 --> 00:08:25.958\nIn the midst of all this, my mother fell ill with a stomach ailment for two or three days.\n\n00:08:26.958 --> 00:08:28.958\nWe thought she was going to die.\n\n00:08:28.958 --> 00:08:30.958\nMy father was not there.\n\n00:08:30.958 --> 00:08:31.958\nHe was in the army.\n\n00:08:31.958 --> 00:08:35.958\nSo I was the oldest person in the house.\n\n00:08:35.958 --> 00:08:39.958\nMy sister fell very ill with malaria.\n\n00:08:40.958 --> 00:08:45.958\nShe was three years old and I was 15.\n\n00:08:45.958 --> 00:08:47.958\nAnd she had such a high fever. We tried everything.\n\n00:08:47.958 --> 00:08:51.958\nIt didn't look like it was going to work.\n\n00:08:51.958 --> 00:08:55.958\nUntil we heard that 10 kilometers away there was a doctor, who was\n\n00:08:55.958 --> 00:08:57.958\nlooking at people and giving them meds.\n\n00:08:57.958 --> 00:09:00.958\nNow I put my sister on my back -- burning --\n\n00:09:01.958 --> 00:09:03.958\nand I walked 10 kilometers with her strapped on my back.\n\n00:09:04.958 --> 00:09:09.958\nIt was really hot. I was very hungry.\n\n00:09:09.958 --> 00:09:12.958\nI was scared because I knew her life depended on my getting to this woman.\n\n00:09:12.958 --> 00:09:14.958\nWe heard there was a woman doctor who was treating people.\n\n00:09:14.958 --> 00:09:16.958\nI walked 10 kilometers, putting one foot in front of the other.\n\n00:09:17.958 --> 00:09:19.958\nI got there and I saw huge crowds.\n\n00:09:20.958 --> 00:09:23.958\nAlmost a thousand people were there, trying to break down the door.\n\n00:09:23.958 --> 00:09:28.958\nShe was doing this in a church. How was I going to get in?\n\n00:09:29.958 --> 00:09:32.958\nI had to crawl in between the legs of these people\n\n00:09:32.958 --> 00:09:35.958\nwith my sister strapped on my back,\n\n00:09:36.958 --> 00:09:37.958\nfind a way to a window.\n\n00:09:37.958 --> 00:09:39.958\nAnd while they were trying to break down the door,\n\n00:09:40.958 --> 00:09:42.958\nI climbed in through the window, and jumped in.\n\n00:09:44.958 --> 00:09:47.958\nThis woman told me it was in the nick of time.\n\n00:09:47.958 --> 00:09:51.958\nBy the time we jumped into that hall, she was barely moving.\n\n00:09:51.958 --> 00:09:55.958\nShe gave a shot of her chloroquine -- what I learned was the chloroquine then --\n\n00:09:55.958 --> 00:09:57.958\ngave her some -- it must have been a re-hydration --\n\n00:09:58.958 --> 00:10:01.958\nand some other therapies, and put us in a corner.\n\n00:10:05.958 --> 00:10:07.958\nIn about two to three hours, she started to move.\n\n00:10:10.958 --> 00:10:12.958\nAnd then they toweled her down because she started sweating,\n\n00:10:13.958 --> 00:10:18.958\nwhich was a good sign.\n\n00:10:18.958 --> 00:10:22.958\nAnd then my sister woke up.\n\n00:10:22.958 --> 00:10:25.958\nAnd about five or six hours later, she said we could go home.\n\n00:10:25.958 --> 00:10:28.958\nI strapped her on my back.\n\n00:10:28.958 --> 00:10:32.958\nI walked the 10 kilometers back and it was the shortest walk I ever had.\n\n00:10:32.958 --> 00:10:38.958\nI was so happy -- (Applause) -- that my sister was alive!\n\n00:10:39.958 --> 00:10:41.958\nToday she's 41 years old, a mother of three,\n\n00:10:41.958 --> 00:10:43.958\nand she's a physician saving other lives.\n\n00:10:44.958 --> 00:10:46.958\nWhy am I telling that? I'm telling you that because --\n\n00:10:46.958 --> 00:10:52.958\nwhen it is you or your person involved --\n\n00:10:52.958 --> 00:10:55.958\nyou don't care where -- whether it's aid.\n\n00:10:57.958 --> 00:11:05.958\nYou don't care what it is! (Applause)\n\n00:11:05.958 --> 00:11:10.958\nYou just want the person to be alive!\n\n00:11:10.958 --> 00:11:13.958\nAnd now let me become less sentimental, and say that saving lives --\n\n00:11:13.958 --> 00:11:16.958\nwhich some of the aid we get does on this continent --\n\n00:11:16.958 --> 00:11:19.958\nwhen you save the life of anyone, a farmer, a teacher, a mother,\n\n00:11:19.958 --> 00:11:21.958\nthey are contributing productively into the economy.\n\n00:11:21.958 --> 00:11:25.958\nAnd as an economist, we can also look at that side of the story.\n\n00:11:30.958 --> 00:11:32.958\nThese are people who are productive agents in the economy.\n\n00:11:32.958 --> 00:11:36.958\nSo if we save people from HIV/AIDS, if we save them from malaria,\n\n00:11:36.958 --> 00:11:39.958\nit means they can form the base of production for our economy.\n\n00:11:39.958 --> 00:11:43.958\nAnd by the same token --\n\n00:11:43.958 --> 00:11:45.958\nas someone said yesterday -- if we don't and they die,\n\n00:11:45.958 --> 00:11:47.958\ntheir children will become a burden on the economy.\n\n00:11:47.958 --> 00:11:51.958\nSo even from an economic standpoint,\n\n00:11:51.958 --> 00:11:53.958\nif we leave the social and the humanitarian,\n\n00:11:53.958 --> 00:11:56.958\nwe need to save lives now.\n\n00:11:56.958 --> 00:11:59.958\nSo that's one of the reasons, from a personal experience, that I say\n\n00:11:59.958 --> 00:12:03.958\nlet's channel these resources we get into something productive.\n\n00:12:05.958 --> 00:12:09.958\nHowever, I will also tell you that I'm one of those\n\n00:12:09.958 --> 00:12:12.958\nwho doesn't believe that this is the sole answer.\n\n00:12:12.958 --> 00:12:14.958\nThat's why I said the debate has to get more sophisticated.\n\n00:12:15.958 --> 00:12:20.958\nYou know, we have to use it well.\n\n00:12:21.958 --> 00:12:25.958\nWhat has happened in Europe?\n\n00:12:25.958 --> 00:12:28.958\nDo you all know that Spain -- part of the EU --\n\n00:12:29.958 --> 00:12:33.958\ngot 10 billion dollars in aid from the rest of the EU?\n\n00:12:33.958 --> 00:12:35.958\nResources that were transferred to them --\n\n00:12:37.958 --> 00:12:40.958\nand were the Spanish ashamed of this? No!\n\n00:12:40.958 --> 00:12:42.958\nThe EU transferred 10 billion. Where did they use it?\n\n00:12:42.958 --> 00:12:46.958\nHave you been to southern Spain lately? There are roads everywhere.\n\n00:12:47.958 --> 00:12:50.958\nInfrastructure everywhere.\n\n00:12:50.958 --> 00:12:52.958\nIt is on the back of this that the whole of southern Spain\n\n00:12:52.958 --> 00:12:54.958\nhas developed into a services economy.\n\n00:12:55.958 --> 00:12:57.958\nDid you know that Ireland got 3 billion dollars in aid?\n\n00:12:57.958 --> 00:13:01.958\nIreland is one of the fastest-growing economies in the European Union today.\n\n00:13:01.958 --> 00:13:04.958\nFor which many people, even from other parts of the world,\n\n00:13:07.958 --> 00:13:09.958\nare going there to find jobs.\n\n00:13:09.958 --> 00:13:12.958\nWhat did they do with the 3 billion dollars in aid?\n\n00:13:12.958 --> 00:13:15.958\nThey used it to build an information superhighway,\n\n00:13:15.958 --> 00:13:18.958\ngain infrastructure that\n\n00:13:19.958 --> 00:13:20.958\nenables them to participate in the\n\n00:13:21.958 --> 00:13:23.958\ninformation technology revolution,\n\n00:13:23.958 --> 00:13:26.958\nand to create jobs in their economy.\n\n00:13:26.958 --> 00:13:28.958\nThey didn't say, \"No, you know, we're not going to take this.\"\n\n00:13:28.958 --> 00:13:31.958\nToday, the European Union is busy transferring aid.\n\n00:13:31.958 --> 00:13:33.958\nMy frustration is if they can build infrastructure in Spain --\n\n00:13:33.958 --> 00:13:37.958\nwhich is roads, highways, other things that they can build --\n\n00:13:37.958 --> 00:13:39.958\nI say then, why do they refuse to use the same aid\n\n00:13:39.958 --> 00:13:41.958\nto build the same infrastructure in our countries? (Applause)\n\n00:13:41.958 --> 00:13:50.958\nWhen we ask them and tell them what we need,\n\n00:13:52.958 --> 00:13:54.958\none of my worries today is that we have many foundations now.\n\n00:13:54.958 --> 00:13:57.958\nNow we talk about the World Bank, IMF, and accountability, all that\n\n00:13:57.958 --> 00:13:59.958\nand the EU.\n\n00:13:59.958 --> 00:14:04.958\nWe also have private citizens now who have a lot of money --\n\n00:14:04.958 --> 00:14:06.958\nsome of them in this audience, with private foundations.\n\n00:14:06.958 --> 00:14:09.958\nAnd one day, these foundations have so much money,\n\n00:14:09.958 --> 00:14:11.958\nthey will overtake the official aid that is being given.\n\n00:14:12.958 --> 00:14:16.958\nBut I fear -- and I'm very grateful to all of them\n\n00:14:17.958 --> 00:14:19.958\nfor what they are trying to do on the continent --\n\n00:14:19.958 --> 00:14:26.958\nbut I'm also worried. I wake up with a gnawing in my belly\n\n00:14:26.958 --> 00:14:29.958\nbecause I see a new set of aid entrepreneurs on the continent.\n\n00:14:29.958 --> 00:14:33.958\nAnd they're also going from country to country,\n\n00:14:33.958 --> 00:14:38.958\nand many times trying to find what to do.\n\n00:14:38.958 --> 00:14:41.958\nBut I'm not really sure that their assistance\n\n00:14:41.958 --> 00:14:45.958\nis also being channeled in the right way.\n\n00:14:45.958 --> 00:14:47.958\nAnd many of them are not really familiar with the continent.\n\n00:14:47.958 --> 00:14:49.958\nThey are just discovering.\n\n00:14:50.958 --> 00:14:53.958\nAnd many times I don't see Africans working with them.\n\n00:14:53.958 --> 00:14:56.958\nThey are just going alone! (Applause)\n\n00:14:56.958 --> 00:14:58.958\nAnd many times I get the impression that they are not really even interested\n\n00:14:58.958 --> 00:15:02.958\nin hearing from Africans who might know.\n\n00:15:02.958 --> 00:15:05.958\nThey want to visit us,\n\n00:15:05.958 --> 00:15:07.958\nsee what's happening on the ground and make a decision.\n\n00:15:07.958 --> 00:15:09.958\nAnd now I'm maybe being harsh.\n\n00:15:09.958 --> 00:15:11.958\nBut I worry because this money is so important.\n\n00:15:12.958 --> 00:15:17.958\nNow, who are they accountable to?\n\n00:15:17.958 --> 00:15:19.958\nAre we on their boards when they make decisions\n\n00:15:19.958 --> 00:15:22.958\nabout where to channel money? Are we there?\n\n00:15:22.958 --> 00:15:25.958\nWill we make the same mistake that we made before?\n\n00:15:25.958 --> 00:15:27.958\nHave our presidents and our leaders -- everyone is talking about --\n\n00:15:27.958 --> 00:15:29.958\nhave they ever called these people together and said,\n\n00:15:29.958 --> 00:15:32.958\n\"Look, your foundation and your foundation --\n\n00:15:32.958 --> 00:15:34.958\nyou have so much money, we are grateful.\n\n00:15:34.958 --> 00:15:37.958\nLet's sit down and really tell you where the money should be channeled\n\n00:15:37.958 --> 00:15:40.958\nand where this aid should go.\"\n\n00:15:40.958 --> 00:15:44.958\nHave we done that? The answer is no.\n\n00:15:45.958 --> 00:15:48.958\nAnd each one is making their own individual effort.\n\n00:15:48.958 --> 00:15:51.958\nAnd then 10 years from now, billions will again have gone into Africa,\n\n00:15:51.958 --> 00:15:55.958\nand we would still have the same problems.\n\n00:15:55.958 --> 00:15:58.958\nThis is what gives us the hopeless image.\n\n00:15:58.958 --> 00:16:02.958\nOur inability to take charge and say to all these people bringing their money,\n\n00:16:02.958 --> 00:16:03.958\n\"Sit down.\"\n\n00:16:04.958 --> 00:16:06.958\nAnd we don't do it because there are so many of us. We don't coordinate.\n\n00:16:06.958 --> 00:16:11.958\nWe've not called the Bill Gates, and the Soros,\n\n00:16:12.958 --> 00:16:17.958\nand everybody else who is helping and say,\n\n00:16:17.958 --> 00:16:20.958\n\"Sit down. Let's have a conference with you.\n\n00:16:20.958 --> 00:16:23.958\nAs a continent, here are our priorities.\n\n00:16:23.958 --> 00:16:26.958\nHere is where we want you to channel this money.\"\n\n00:16:27.958 --> 00:16:29.958\nEach one should not be an entrepreneur\n\n00:16:29.958 --> 00:16:32.958\ngoing out and finding what is best.\n\n00:16:32.958 --> 00:16:36.958\nWe're not trying to stop them at all! But to help them help us better.\n\n00:16:36.958 --> 00:16:39.958\nAnd what is disappointing me is that we are not doing this.\n\n00:16:39.958 --> 00:16:41.958\nTen years from now we will have the same story,\n\n00:16:41.958 --> 00:16:45.958\nand we will be repeating the same things.\n\n00:16:46.958 --> 00:16:51.958\nSo our problem right now is, how can we leverage\n\n00:16:51.958 --> 00:16:56.958\nall this good will that is coming towards our way?\n\n00:16:57.958 --> 00:17:01.958\nHow can we get government to combine properly\n\n00:17:01.958 --> 00:17:04.958\nwith these private foundations, with the international organizations,\n\n00:17:04.958 --> 00:17:07.958\nand with our private sector.\n\n00:17:07.958 --> 00:17:10.958\nI firmly believe in that private sector thing too.\n\n00:17:11.958 --> 00:17:12.958\nBut it cannot do it alone.\n\n00:17:13.958 --> 00:17:15.958\nSo there might be a few ideas we could think of that could work.\n\n00:17:16.958 --> 00:17:19.958\nThey said this is about proliferating and sharing ideas.\n\n00:17:19.958 --> 00:17:24.958\nSo why don't we think of using some of this aid?\n\n00:17:24.958 --> 00:17:26.958\nWell, why don't we first say to those helping us out,\n\n00:17:27.958 --> 00:17:29.958\n\"Don't be shy about infrastructure.\n\n00:17:29.958 --> 00:17:33.958\nThat health that you're working on cannot be sustainable without infrastructure.\n\n00:17:36.958 --> 00:17:41.958\nThat education will work better\n\n00:17:41.958 --> 00:17:44.958\nif we've got electricity and railroads, and so on.\n\n00:17:44.958 --> 00:17:47.958\nThat agriculture will work better if there are railroads to get the goods to market.\n\n00:17:47.958 --> 00:17:49.958\nDon't be shy of it.\n\n00:17:52.958 --> 00:17:55.958\nInvest some of your resources in that, too.\"\n\n00:17:55.958 --> 00:18:00.958\nAnd then we can see that this is one combination\n\n00:18:00.958 --> 00:18:02.958\nof private, international, multilateral money,\n\n00:18:04.958 --> 00:18:07.958\nprivate sector and the African that we can put together as a partnership,\n\n00:18:07.958 --> 00:18:12.958\nso that aid can be a facilitator.\n\n00:18:12.958 --> 00:18:15.958\nThat is all aid can be.\n\n00:18:15.958 --> 00:18:17.958\nAid cannot solve our problems, I'm firmly convinced about that.\n\n00:18:17.958 --> 00:18:21.958\nBut it can be catalytic. And if we fail to use it as catalytic,\n\n00:18:21.958 --> 00:18:25.958\nwe would have failed.\n\n00:18:26.958 --> 00:18:28.958\nOne of the reasons why China is a bit popular with Africans now --\n\n00:18:29.958 --> 00:18:34.958\none of the reasons is not only just that, you know, these people are stupid\n\n00:18:34.958 --> 00:18:36.958\nand China is coming to take resources.\n\n00:18:37.958 --> 00:18:39.958\nIt's because there's a little more leverage in terms of the Chinese.\n\n00:18:43.958 --> 00:18:46.958\nIf you tell them, \"We need a road here,\"\n\n00:18:48.958 --> 00:18:50.958\nthey will help you build it.\n\n00:18:50.958 --> 00:18:51.958\nThey don't shy away from infrastructure.\n\n00:18:51.958 --> 00:18:53.958\nIn fact, the Chinese minister of finance said to me,\n\n00:18:53.958 --> 00:18:55.958\nwhen I asked him what are we doing wrong in Nigeria.\n\n00:18:55.958 --> 00:18:58.958\nHe said, \"There are two things you need only.\n\n00:18:58.958 --> 00:19:01.958\nInfrastructure, infrastructure, infrastructure and discipline.\n\n00:19:01.958 --> 00:19:04.958\nYou are undisciplined.\" (Applause)\n\n00:19:10.958 --> 00:19:13.958\nAnd I repeat it for the continent.\n\n00:19:14.958 --> 00:19:15.958\nIt's the same. We need infrastructure, infrastructure and discipline.\n\n00:19:15.958 --> 00:19:18.958\nSo we can make a catalytic to help us provide some of that.\n\n00:19:18.958 --> 00:19:21.958\nNow I realize -- I'm not saying -- health and education --\n\n00:19:22.958 --> 00:19:25.958\nno, you can also provide that as well.\n\n00:19:25.958 --> 00:19:28.958\nBut I'm saying it's not either or.\n\n00:19:28.958 --> 00:19:29.958\nLet's see how aid can be a facilitator in partnership.\n\n00:19:30.958 --> 00:19:32.958\nOne idea.\n\n00:19:33.958 --> 00:19:36.958\nSecond thing, for the private sector,\n\n00:19:36.958 --> 00:19:40.958\npeople are afraid to take risks on the continent.\n\n00:19:40.958 --> 00:19:42.958\nWhy can't some of this aid be used as a kind of guarantee mechanisms,\n\n00:19:42.958 --> 00:19:46.958\nto enable people to take risk?\n\n00:19:46.958 --> 00:19:47.958\n(Applause)\n\n00:19:47.958 --> 00:19:53.958\nAnd finally, because they are both standing at my -- I'm out of time.\n\n00:19:53.958 --> 00:19:56.958\nAm I out of time?\n\n00:19:56.958 --> 00:19:59.958\nOK, so let me not forget my punchline.\n\n00:19:59.958 --> 00:20:02.958\nOne of the things I want everybody to collaborate on is\n\n00:20:02.958 --> 00:20:11.958\nto support women, to create jobs. (Applause)\n\n00:20:11.958 --> 00:20:13.958\nA lot has been said here about women, I don't need to repeat it.\n\n00:20:13.958 --> 00:20:15.958\nBut there are people -- women -- creating jobs.\n\n00:20:16.958 --> 00:20:18.958\nAnd we know, studies have shown\n\n00:20:18.958 --> 00:20:21.958\nthat when you put resources in the hand of the woman --\n\n00:20:21.958 --> 00:20:23.958\nin fact, there's an econometric study,\n\n00:20:23.958 --> 00:20:26.958\nthe World Bank Review, done in 2000, showing that\n\n00:20:26.958 --> 00:20:29.958\ntransfers into the hands of women result\n\n00:20:29.958 --> 00:20:32.958\nin healthier children, more for the household, more for the economy and all that.\n\n00:20:34.958 --> 00:20:36.958\nSo I'm saying that one of the takeaways from here --\n\n00:20:37.958 --> 00:20:38.958\nI'm not saying the men are not important --\n\n00:20:38.958 --> 00:20:41.958\nobviously, if you leave the husbands out, what will they do?\n\n00:20:41.958 --> 00:20:43.958\nThey'll come back home and get disgruntled,\n\n00:20:43.958 --> 00:20:46.958\nand it will result in difficulties we don't want.\n\n00:20:47.958 --> 00:20:49.958\nWe don't want men beating their wives\n\n00:20:49.958 --> 00:20:51.958\nbecause they don't have a job, and so on.\n\n00:20:52.958 --> 00:20:55.958\nBut at the margin, we also -- I want to push this,\n\n00:20:55.958 --> 00:20:58.958\nbecause the reason is the men automatically --\n\n00:20:59.958 --> 00:21:02.958\nthey get -- not automatically, but they tend to get more support.\n\n00:21:04.958 --> 00:21:07.958\nBut I want you to realize that resources\n\n00:21:07.958 --> 00:21:11.958\nin the hands of African women is a powerful tool.\n\n00:21:11.958 --> 00:21:15.958\nThere are people creating jobs.\n\n00:21:15.958 --> 00:21:17.958\nBeatrice Gakuba has created 200 jobs from her flower business in Rwanda.\n\n00:21:17.958 --> 00:21:21.958\nWe have Ibukun Awosika in Nigeria, with the chair company.\n\n00:21:22.958 --> 00:21:23.958\nShe wants to expand.\n\n00:21:24.958 --> 00:21:26.958\nShe needs another 20 million.\n\n00:21:26.958 --> 00:21:29.958\nShe will create another 100, 200 more jobs.\n\n00:21:30.958 --> 00:21:34.958\nSo take away from here is how are you going to put together\n\n00:21:34.958 --> 00:21:36.958\nthe resources to put money in the hands of women in the middle\n\n00:21:36.958 --> 00:21:40.958\nwho are ready --\n\n00:21:40.958 --> 00:21:42.958\nbusiness people who want to expand and create more jobs.\n\n00:21:43.958 --> 00:21:47.958\nAnd lastly, what are you going to do\n\n00:21:48.958 --> 00:21:53.958\nto be part of this partnership of aid, government, private sector\n\n00:21:53.958 --> 00:21:56.958\nand the African as an individual?\n\n00:21:56.958 --> 00:22:05.958\nThank you.

Or rather, I should say, welcome home. Because this is where it all really began, isn't it? Looking at fossils dating back several millions of years \u2014 it all points to evidence that life for the human species as we know it began right here. We are on an amazing journey the next four days. You're going to hear stories of \"Africa: The Next Chapter.\" Fantastic tales, anecdotes from speakers. But I want to turn that upside down for a moment, and get something out on the table and clear the air so to say. What's the worst thing you've ever heard about Africa? And this is not a rhetorical question. I actually want answers from you. Go for it! The worst. Famine. Corruption. More. Genocide. AIDS. Slavery. That's enough.We've all heard these things. But this is about Africa, the story we have not heard. The stories that we want to know, and the stories that do exist about positive tales. A part of my talk is going to be about investment opportunities that exist on this continent, to separate the rhetoric from the reality, the fact from the fiction. To go to the actual data and statistics that exist about the actual things that are happening on the ground that make Africa a realistic investment opportunity and option for you. So let's get going because Africa, to some degree, is on a turnaround. A turnaround in terms of how it manages its image, and how it takes control of its own destiny. And turnarounds are part and parcel of what I have focused on for most of my professional career. And it all started almost a decade ago, as a young consultant at McKinsey & Company at their first African office in Johannesburg.And there we worked with leading CEOs on African issues, and African companies on turnarounds, making the companies not just the best in Africa but the best globally. But I really formalized this focus on turnarounds when I was completing my MBA in the United States. It all began with a fantastic phone call. It was from Rosabeth Moss Kanter, Harvard Business School guru and a professor of mine. And she said, \"I want to write a case, Euvin \u2014 a case on a public-sector leader that has lessons for the corporate world.\" And the leader that came to mind was Nelson Mandela. Because Nelson Mandela, as he took over power as the first democratically-elected president of South Africa, faced a situation of a country that could have slid into the abyss of chaos. But he started the country on a path of a positive cycle.Now the case, \"Nelson Mandela: Change Leader,\" became part of the research base for a chapter in Rosabeth's new book called \"Confidence.\" And \"Confidence\" became a New York Times bestseller and topped Business Week's hardcover bestseller list. And why I tell you this story is because later, when I was interviewed on SABC Africa, on a pan-African broadcast, they asked, \"What is your key lesson, or the key thing you enjoy the most?\" \u2014 because it was a huge privilege to be part of such a project. The lesson from that was that it was Africa \u2014 an African story \u2014 that was used to share news with the rest of the world of what the benchmark can be for corporate turnarounds. Africa was being used as a success story!So I want to share with you a personal story about a turnaround or a transformation. And that has to do with me because in 1994, I packed a few things into a backpack and headed off for a year of travel in the middle of my university career. You should have seen my parents' reaction!(Laughter)But very soon, I found myself from the southern part of Africa, in South Africa \u2014 at the very north, in Egypt. And I sought out the most remote places. I went to the Siwa Oasis. That was one of my stops. And the Siwa Oasis is famous for several things, but the key thing is that it was the place that Alexander the Great went to when he wanted to find out what his destiny had in store for him. And legend has it that Alexander trekked through this desert. Half his battalion was wiped out in the sandstorm. And myth says that he had an audience with the oracle, and it foretold his destiny of greatness. This was 300 BC. So Africa had long been seen as a place to go to for answers.Now, the thing I remember about Siwa was the magical view of the sky at night. With no natural light source, Siva is one of these amazing places that when you look up you see a perfect tapestry. Fast forward to 2002. I'm sitting in Cambridge, Massachusetts at the Healthcare Development Conference. And I see the same picture, but from the opposite side. A satellite picture looking down at the earth. And it was that picture that made such a profound impact on me because I'll never forget it. I remember the very moment. And I wanted to share that image with you of what I saw at that point. The first thing that I saw was North America at night \u2014 glowing, in all its glory. A warm feeling. Light.And then I saw it \u2014 Africa. Quite literally the \"Dark Continent.\" And while Africa may be dark, the thing that brought the message home to me was that this is the challenge we are facing, but it's also the opportunity. Because whilst Africa may be dark \u2014 other than the few specks that exist north and in the south and other areas \u2014 it's aglow with the light in the hearts of the millions of people that are there. Entrepreneurs, dynamic people, people with hope. It was George Kimble, the geographer, who said that, \"The only thing dark about Africa is our ignorance of it.\" So let's start shedding light on this amazing eclectic continent that has so much to offer.Let's start unpacking it. Africa is the second-largest continent, a landmass second from Asia. It also is the second most populated continent, with 900 million people. In fact \u2014 coming back to the land mass \u2014 Africa is so big that you could fit in the continental United States, China, and the entire Europe into Africa, and still have space. Africa is home to over 1,000 languages \u2014 2,000 is another estimate that's out there \u2014 with over 2,000 languages and dialects. But you could say, \"Invest in Africa in over 1,000 languages, and it wouldn't make a difference.\" What does the data say? As an investment banker, I'm in the cross-flow of information and the changes that are taking place in capital markets. So I want to share with you some of these bellwether signals, or signs, and winds of change that are sweeping this continent.So let's start on that. And let's start at the high level, on the macro-factors. Inflation, in general, is coming down across Africa \u2014 that's the first sign \u2014 in many countries reaching double-digit figures. So let's start looking at some of those. I call it my Z.E.N. cluster. Zambia: from 2004 to 2006, moves from the 18 percent in inflation to the nine percent. Egypt: from the 16 percent to about 8.4 percent. Nigeria: a similar situation, from the 16 percent to the eight percent. Single digits. More fascinating, you have other countries \u2014 South Africa, Mauritius, Namibia \u2014 all in single digits. But that's just part of the story. You have a similar trend with currencies \u2014 currencies going through an extreme time of stability. But that's looking at the big picture. And the first myth to dispel is that Africa is not a country. It's made up \u2014(Applause)It's made up of 53 different countries. So the very definition \u2014 to say \"invest in Africa\" is a no-go. It's meaningless. Each country has a unique value proposition. You can make money, you can lose money in Africa. But opportunities, boy oh boy, they exist. And this is what today is about \u2014 it's about discussing those very opportunities. So let's start getting into the countries and into the specific material and data. I was recently elected, as Emeka mentioned, as the President of the South African Chamber of Commerce in America. And I'm very proud and happy to be in that role because it is a fascinating position to be in. To hear this dialogue that's just increasing in tenor and velocity, of decisions about trade and companies wanting to come. So the first port of call: let's talk a little bit about South Africa. But not the South Africa we always talk about \u2014 the gold, the minerals, the First World infrastructure \u2014 a bit about the other side of it.For example, South Africa was recently voted as the top destination for the top 1,000 UK companies for offshore call-centers. Same language, timeline, et cetera. Makes sense. Other headlines that have recently reached South Africa were Bain Capital and KKR, the big boys of private equity. Headline in South Africa: \"They have landed.\" Quite ominous. But what were they there for? To acquire assets. Bing Capital's acquisition of Edcon, a large retailer, is testimony to the confidence they are starting to place in the economy. Because it is actually a long-term play. Being a retailer, it is a play on the belief that this middle-class that's growing will continue to grow, that the boom and the confidence in consumer spending will continue. But the story of Africa, and my focus, is beyond South Africa because there's so much happening. Undoubtedly, Nigeria is clearly a hot spot. Challenges \u2014 and we will hear a lot about Nigeria in these four days.But looking at Goldman Sachs' work \u2014 we had the famous BRIC Report. The new report, \"The Next Eleven,\" highlights that by 2020 Nigeria is going to be amongst the top 10 economies in the world. It's an investment opportunity. Think about that. Is anyone \u2014 our banks, our investors \u2014 seriously thinking about going to Nigeria? If you haven't, why not? What's going on in Nigeria? A couple of things. I want to talk about it from the perspective of capital markets. Bellwether signs again. Guarantee Trust Bank recently issued the first Euro Bond out of Africa, and this excludes South Africa. But the first Eurobond, the raising of international capital offshore, off its own balance sheet, without any sovereign backing \u2014 that is an indication of the confidence that is taking place in that economy. Without any sovereign backing, a Nigerian company raising capital offshore. It's just a sign of things to come.Looking at the oil industry, Africa provides 18 percent of the U.S.'s oil supply, with the Middle East just 16 percent. It's an important strategic partner. Let's put Nigeria in perspective. 2.2 to 2.4 million barrels of oil a day \u2014 the same league as Kuwait, the same league as Venezuela. But with Africa, let's start being careful about this. And Emeka and I have had these discussions. We have to move away from what's called \"the curse of the commodities.\" Because it's not about oil, it's not about commodities. For Africa to truly be sustainable, we have to move beyond to other industries.So let's unpack those very quickly, and I'm going to move through these very, very, very fast because I can see that clock counting down. What else is going on there? Egypt. Egypt is launching a first large industrial zone \u2014 2.8 billion investment. The announcement just came out the last few weeks. Close to the Mediterranean, near Alexandria \u2014 textiles, petrochemicals. It's being managed by a Singaporean-based management company. So they want to emerge as an industrial powerhouse across the industries \u2014 away from oil.Let's look at agriculture. Let's look at forestry. What's going on there? In Tanzania last week, we had the launch of the East African Organic Produce Standard. Again, gathering together farmers, gathering together stakeholders in East Africa to get standards for organic produce. Better prices. It ties in with small-scale farmers in terms of no pesticides, no fertilizers. Again, opportunity to tackle markets to get that higher price. Uganda: the New Forest Company, replanting and redeveloping their forests. Why is that important? As the energy needs are met and electricity is needed [we will need] poles for rolling out electricity. But here is the sweetener in the deal. They're going to be tapping into carbon credits. Let's go back to Nigeria. The banking sector has undergone tremendous transformation, from over 80 banks to 25 banks. Strengthening of the system. But what's going on there? Only 10 percent of the country is banked. The largest population in Africa is in Nigeria. 135 million-plus people. Think about that. There are only 700 ATMs in the country. Opportunity.The same for telecoms across the country. Now let's look at the continent as a whole. People look at the roads, for example, and they'd say, \"Angola: 90 percent of roads are untarred. Ah, problem!\" It's more expensive to transport goods. Prices of goods go up, inflation is affected. Nigeria: 70 percent of roads are untarred. Zambia: 80 percent. In general, more than 50 percent of roads are untarred. This is an opportunity! Energy needs \u2014 it's an opportunity. So what are the signs that things are fundamentally changing? Let's look at the stock markets in Africa. If I had to ask you, \"In 2005 what was the best performing stock market or stock exchange in the world?\" Would Egypt come to mind? In 2005, the Egyptian stock exchange returned over 145 percent. What's going on in some of the other countries? Let's look at some 2006 numbers. Kenya: over 60 percent. Nigeria: over 40 percent. South Africa: in the 20 percents. High ones. These are the trends that are taking place. But in any investment decision, the key question is, \"What is my alternative investment?\"Because in Africa today, we are competing globally for capital. And global capital is agnostic \u2014 it has no loyalties. There's an overhang of capital in the U.S., and the key is yield pickup. What Africa is providing is a diversification play, and also opportunities for yield pickup for the investor that's aware of what he or she is doing. Now, when looking at Africa vis-a-vis other things, and countries in Africa vis-a-vis other things, comparisons become important. 10 years ago there, were very few countries that received sovereign ratings from the Standard & Poors, Moody's and Fitch's. Today, 16 African countries and growing have sovereign country ratings. What does this mean? Take Nigeria again: double B-minus \u2014 in the league of Ukraine and Turkey. Immediately we have a comparison. The backbone of making investment decisions for global holders of capital. Some other figures. South Africa: triple B-plus. Botswana: A-plus. Bakino Faso: B-minus. And so on.In fact, one of the big agencies is setting up an office in Africa. Why are they doing that? Because they expect investment to follow. So one of the big bellwethers, and one of my final points I want to mention, is the interesting thing I read is that CNBC has launched their first African channel. Why is CNBC doing this? It's the 24-hour rolling African news channel. They're doing it because they are expecting things to happen. Me and you, the investments we are going to be making, the investments the world is going to be making \u2014 that's the 24-hour news channel dedicated to Africa. So that's the change that's coming down the pipeline.So in conclusion, I want to turn back to that very slide that made such a deep impact on me all those years ago. This time [I'll] give you the entire picture that I saw in 2002, and ask you that when you think about what your role can be in Africa, think about your journey in terms of bringing light to this continent. Because there are amazing opportunities available. And think about the concept of transformation in the back of your mind because things can be turned around rather quickly.In 1899, Joseph Conrad released \"The Heart of Darkness,\" a tale of grim horror along the Congo River. If one looks carefully, on the Congo River is one of those bright lights. And that's the very Congo river generating light \u2014 the old heart of darkness now generating light with hydro-electric power. That is a transformation in power of ideas. So the next step, over the next four days, is us exploring more of these ideas. And perchance, if you can always keep this picture in your mind, that when we convene maybe in the distant future, in 2020, that picture will look very different. Thank you.(Applause)", "id": 154, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:12.958 --> 00:00:16.958\nWelcome to Africa!

Company\n\n00:02:14.958 --> 00:02:17.958\nat their first African office in Johannesburg.\n\n00:02:17.958 --> 00:02:20.958\nAnd there we worked with leading CEOs\n\n00:02:20.958 --> 00:02:23.958\non African issues, and African companies on turnarounds,\n\n00:02:23.958 --> 00:02:26.958\nmaking the companies not just the best in Africa\n\n00:02:26.958 --> 00:02:28.958\nbut the best globally.\n\n00:02:28.958 --> 00:02:32.958\nBut I really formalized this focus on turnarounds\n\n00:02:32.958 --> 00:02:35.958\nwhen I was completing my MBA in the United States.\n\n00:02:35.958 --> 00:02:37.958\nIt all began with a fantastic phone call.\n\n00:02:37.958 --> 00:02:40.958\nIt was from Rosabeth Moss Kanter,\n\n00:02:40.958 --> 00:02:42.958\nHarvard Business School guru and a professor of mine.\n\n00:02:42.958 --> 00:02:45.958\nAnd she said, \"I want to write a case, Euvin --\n\n00:02:45.958 --> 00:02:47.958\na case on a public-sector leader\n\n00:02:47.958 --> 00:02:51.958\nthat has lessons for the corporate world.\"\n\n00:02:51.958 --> 00:02:55.958\nAnd the leader that came to mind was Nelson Mandela.\n\n00:02:55.958 --> 00:02:58.958\nBecause Nelson Mandela, as he took over power\n\n00:02:58.958 --> 00:03:01.958\nas the first democratically-elected president of South Africa,\n\n00:03:01.958 --> 00:03:03.958\nfaced a situation of a country\n\n00:03:03.958 --> 00:03:06.958\nthat could have slid into the abyss of chaos.\n\n00:03:06.958 --> 00:03:10.958\nBut he started the country on a path of a positive cycle.\n\n00:03:10.958 --> 00:03:13.958\nNow the case, \"Nelson Mandela: Change Leader,\"\n\n00:03:13.958 --> 00:03:16.958\nbecame part of the research base for a chapter\n\n00:03:16.958 --> 00:03:20.958\nin Rosabeth's new book called \"Confidence.\"\n\n00:03:20.958 --> 00:03:24.958\nAnd \"Confidence\" became a New York Times bestseller\n\n00:03:24.958 --> 00:03:27.958\nand topped Business Week's hardcover bestseller list.\n\n00:03:27.958 --> 00:03:30.958\nAnd why I tell you this story is because later, when I was interviewed\n\n00:03:30.958 --> 00:03:33.958\non SABC Africa, on a pan-African broadcast, they asked,\n\n00:03:33.958 --> 00:03:37.958\n\"What is your key lesson, or the key thing you enjoy the most?\" --\n\n00:03:37.958 --> 00:03:40.958\nbecause it was a huge privilege to be part of such a project.\n\n00:03:40.958 --> 00:03:45.958\nThe lesson from that was that it was Africa -- an African story --\n\n00:03:45.958 --> 00:03:49.958\nthat was used to share news with the rest of the world\n\n00:03:49.958 --> 00:03:52.958\nof what the benchmark can be for corporate turnarounds.\n\n00:03:52.958 --> 00:03:57.958\nAfrica was being used as a success story!\n\n00:03:57.958 --> 00:03:59.958\nSo I want to share with you a personal story\n\n00:03:59.958 --> 00:04:01.958\nabout a turnaround or a transformation.\n\n00:04:01.958 --> 00:04:03.958\nAnd that has to do with me\n\n00:04:03.958 --> 00:04:07.958\nbecause in 1994, I packed a few things into a backpack\n\n00:04:07.958 --> 00:04:09.958\nand headed off for a year of travel\n\n00:04:09.958 --> 00:04:12.958\nin the middle of my university career.\n\n00:04:12.958 --> 00:04:14.958\nYou should have seen my parents' reaction!\n\n00:04:14.958 --> 00:04:15.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:04:15.958 --> 00:04:19.958\nBut very soon, I found myself from the southern part of Africa,\n\n00:04:19.958 --> 00:04:22.958\nin South Africa -- at the very north, in Egypt.\n\n00:04:22.958 --> 00:04:24.958\nAnd I sought out the most remote places.\n\n00:04:24.958 --> 00:04:27.958\nI went to the Siwa Oasis. That was one of my stops.\n\n00:04:27.958 --> 00:04:29.958\nAnd the Siwa Oasis is famous for several things,\n\n00:04:29.958 --> 00:04:31.958\nbut the key thing is that it was the place\n\n00:04:31.958 --> 00:04:34.958\nthat Alexander the Great went to\n\n00:04:34.958 --> 00:04:37.958\nwhen he wanted to find out what his destiny had in store for him.\n\n00:04:37.958 --> 00:04:40.958\nAnd legend has it that Alexander trekked through this desert.\n\n00:04:40.958 --> 00:04:43.958\nHalf his battalion was wiped out in the sandstorm.\n\n00:04:43.958 --> 00:04:46.958\nAnd myth says that he had an audience with the oracle,\n\n00:04:46.958 --> 00:04:49.958\nand it foretold his destiny of greatness.\n\n00:04:49.958 --> 00:04:51.958\nThis was 300 BC.\n\n00:04:51.958 --> 00:04:57.958\nSo Africa had long been seen as a place to go to for answers.\n\n00:04:57.958 --> 00:05:00.958\nNow, the thing I remember about Siwa\n\n00:05:00.958 --> 00:05:03.958\nwas the magical view of the sky at night.\n\n00:05:03.958 --> 00:05:06.958\nWith no natural light source, Siva is one of these amazing places\n\n00:05:06.958 --> 00:05:10.958\nthat when you look up you see a perfect tapestry.\n\n00:05:10.958 --> 00:05:12.958\nFast forward to 2002.\n\n00:05:12.958 --> 00:05:14.958\nI'm sitting in Cambridge, Massachusetts\n\n00:05:14.958 --> 00:05:16.958\nat the Healthcare Development Conference.\n\n00:05:16.958 --> 00:05:19.958\nAnd I see the same picture, but from the opposite side.\n\n00:05:19.958 --> 00:05:24.958\nA satellite picture looking down at the earth.\n\n00:05:24.958 --> 00:05:27.958\nAnd it was that picture that made such a profound impact on me\n\n00:05:27.958 --> 00:05:30.958\nbecause I'll never forget it. I remember the very moment.\n\n00:05:30.958 --> 00:05:36.958\nAnd I wanted to share that image with you of what I saw at that point.\n\n00:05:36.958 --> 00:05:41.958\nThe first thing that I saw was North America at night --\n\n00:05:41.958 --> 00:05:51.958\nglowing, in all its glory. A warm feeling. Light.\n\n00:05:51.958 --> 00:06:01.958\nAnd then I saw it -- Africa. Quite literally the \"Dark Continent.\"\n\n00:06:01.958 --> 00:06:03.958\nAnd while Africa may be dark,\n\n00:06:03.958 --> 00:06:06.958\nthe thing that brought the message home to me\n\n00:06:06.958 --> 00:06:09.958\nwas that this is the challenge we are facing,\n\n00:06:09.958 --> 00:06:12.958\nbut it's also the opportunity.\n\n00:06:12.958 --> 00:06:15.958\nBecause whilst Africa may be dark -- other than the few specks\n\n00:06:15.958 --> 00:06:19.958\nthat exist north and in the south and other areas --\n\n00:06:19.958 --> 00:06:21.958\nit's aglow with the light in the hearts\n\n00:06:21.958 --> 00:06:23.958\nof the millions of people that are there.\n\n00:06:23.958 --> 00:06:27.958\nEntrepreneurs, dynamic people, people with hope.\n\n00:06:27.958 --> 00:06:30.958\nIt was George Kimble, the geographer, who said\n\n00:06:30.958 --> 00:06:35.958\nthat, \"The only thing dark about Africa is our ignorance of it.\"\n\n00:06:35.958 --> 00:06:39.958\nSo let's start shedding light on this amazing eclectic continent\n\n00:06:39.958 --> 00:06:41.958\nthat has so much to offer.\n\n00:06:41.958 --> 00:06:46.958\nLet's start unpacking it.\n\n00:06:46.958 --> 00:06:53.958\nAfrica is the second-largest continent, a landmass second from Asia.\n\n00:06:53.958 --> 00:06:55.958\nIt also is the second most populated continent,\n\n00:06:55.958 --> 00:06:57.958\nwith 900 million people.\n\n00:06:57.958 --> 00:07:00.958\nIn fact -- coming back to the land mass -- Africa is so big\n\n00:07:00.958 --> 00:07:03.958\nthat you could fit in the continental United States,\n\n00:07:03.958 --> 00:07:08.958\nChina, and the entire Europe into Africa, and still have space.\n\n00:07:08.958 --> 00:07:11.958\nAfrica is home to over 1,000 languages --\n\n00:07:11.958 --> 00:07:14.958\n2,000 is another estimate that's out there --\n\n00:07:14.958 --> 00:07:17.958\nwith over 2,000 languages and dialects.\n\n00:07:17.958 --> 00:07:21.958\nBut you could say, \"Invest in Africa in over 1,000 languages,\n\n00:07:21.958 --> 00:07:24.958\nand it wouldn't make a difference.\"\n\n00:07:24.958 --> 00:07:26.958\nWhat does the data say?\n\n00:07:26.958 --> 00:07:30.958\nAs an investment banker, I'm in the cross-flow of information\n\n00:07:30.958 --> 00:07:33.958\nand the changes that are taking place in capital markets.\n\n00:07:33.958 --> 00:07:36.958\nSo I want to share with you some of these bellwether signals, or signs,\n\n00:07:36.958 --> 00:07:38.958\nand winds of change that are sweeping this continent.\n\n00:07:38.958 --> 00:07:40.958\nSo let's start on that.\n\n00:07:40.958 --> 00:07:42.958\nAnd let's start at the high level, on the macro-factors.\n\n00:07:42.958 --> 00:07:45.958\nInflation, in general, is coming down across Africa --\n\n00:07:45.958 --> 00:07:47.958\nthat's the first sign --\n\n00:07:47.958 --> 00:07:49.958\nin many countries reaching double-digit figures.\n\n00:07:49.958 --> 00:07:51.958\nSo let's start looking at some of those.\n\n00:07:51.958 --> 00:07:53.958\nI call it my Z.E.N. cluster.\n\n00:07:53.958 --> 00:07:58.958\nZambia: from 2004 to 2006, moves from the 18 percent in inflation\n\n00:07:58.958 --> 00:08:00.958\nto the nine percent.\n\n00:08:00.958 --> 00:08:05.958\nEgypt: from the 16 percent to about 8.4 percent.\n\n00:08:05.958 --> 00:08:07.958\nNigeria: a similar situation,\n\n00:08:07.958 --> 00:08:13.958\nfrom the 16 percent to the eight percent. Single digits.\n\n00:08:13.958 --> 00:08:17.958\nMore fascinating, you have other countries -- South Africa,\n\n00:08:17.958 --> 00:08:24.958\nMauritius, Namibia -- all in single digits.\n\n00:08:24.958 --> 00:08:27.958\nBut that's just part of the story. You have a similar trend with currencies --\n\n00:08:27.958 --> 00:08:33.958\ncurrencies going through an extreme time of stability.\n\n00:08:33.958 --> 00:08:35.958\nBut that's looking at the big picture.\n\n00:08:35.958 --> 00:08:41.958\nAnd the first myth to dispel is that Africa is not a country.\n\n00:08:41.958 --> 00:08:43.958\nIt's made up --\n\n00:08:43.958 --> 00:08:44.958\n(Applause)\n\n00:08:44.958 --> 00:08:48.958\nIt's made up of 53 different countries.\n\n00:08:48.958 --> 00:08:52.958\nSo the very definition -- to say \"invest in Africa\" is a no-go.\n\n00:08:52.958 --> 00:08:54.958\nIt's meaningless.\n\n00:08:54.958 --> 00:08:57.958\nEach country has a unique value proposition.\n\n00:08:57.958 --> 00:09:00.958\nYou can make money, you can lose money in Africa.\n\n00:09:00.958 --> 00:09:03.958\nBut opportunities, boy oh boy, they exist.\n\n00:09:03.958 --> 00:09:06.958\nAnd this is what today is about --\n\n00:09:06.958 --> 00:09:10.958\nit's about discussing those very opportunities.\n\n00:09:10.958 --> 00:09:12.958\nSo let's start getting into the countries\n\n00:09:12.958 --> 00:09:17.958\nand into the specific material and data.\n\n00:09:17.958 --> 00:09:19.958\nI was recently elected, as Emeka mentioned,\n\n00:09:19.958 --> 00:09:22.958\nas the President of the South African Chamber of Commerce in America.\n\n00:09:22.958 --> 00:09:25.958\nAnd I'm very proud and happy to be in that role\n\n00:09:25.958 --> 00:09:27.958\nbecause it is a fascinating position to be in.\n\n00:09:27.958 --> 00:09:31.958\nTo hear this dialogue that's just increasing in tenor and velocity,\n\n00:09:31.958 --> 00:09:35.958\nof decisions about trade and companies wanting to come.\n\n00:09:35.958 --> 00:09:37.958\nSo the first port of call: let's talk a little bit about South Africa.\n\n00:09:37.958 --> 00:09:39.958\nBut not the South Africa we always talk about --\n\n00:09:39.958 --> 00:09:42.958\nthe gold, the minerals, the First World infrastructure --\n\n00:09:42.958 --> 00:09:44.958\na bit about the other side of it.\n\n00:09:44.958 --> 00:09:48.958\nFor example, South Africa was recently voted as the top destination\n\n00:09:48.958 --> 00:09:52.958\nfor the top 1,000 UK companies for offshore call-centers.\n\n00:09:52.958 --> 00:09:57.958\nSame language, timeline, et cetera. Makes sense.\n\n00:09:57.958 --> 00:09:59.958\nOther headlines that have recently reached South Africa\n\n00:09:59.958 --> 00:10:04.958\nwere Bain Capital and KKR, the big boys of private equity.\n\n00:10:04.958 --> 00:10:07.958\nHeadline in South Africa: \"They have landed.\" Quite ominous.\n\n00:10:07.958 --> 00:10:11.958\nBut what were they there for? To acquire assets.\n\n00:10:11.958 --> 00:10:18.958\nBing Capital's acquisition of Edcon, a large retailer, is testimony\n\n00:10:18.958 --> 00:10:21.958\nto the confidence they are starting to place in the economy.\n\n00:10:21.958 --> 00:10:23.958\nBecause it is actually a long-term play.\n\n00:10:23.958 --> 00:10:25.958\nBeing a retailer, it is a play on the belief\n\n00:10:25.958 --> 00:10:29.958\nthat this middle-class that's growing will continue to grow,\n\n00:10:29.958 --> 00:10:35.958\nthat the boom and the confidence in consumer spending will continue.\n\n00:10:35.958 --> 00:10:40.958\nBut the story of Africa, and my focus, is beyond South Africa\n\n00:10:40.958 --> 00:10:42.958\nbecause there's so much happening.\n\n00:10:42.958 --> 00:10:46.958\nUndoubtedly, Nigeria is clearly a hot spot.\n\n00:10:46.958 --> 00:10:50.958\nChallenges -- and we will hear a lot about Nigeria in these four days.\n\n00:10:50.958 --> 00:10:55.958\nBut looking at Goldman Sachs' work -- we had the famous BRIC Report.\n\n00:10:55.958 --> 00:10:59.958\nThe new report, \"The Next Eleven,\" highlights that by 2020\n\n00:10:59.958 --> 00:11:03.958\nNigeria is going to be amongst the top 10 economies in the world.\n\n00:11:03.958 --> 00:11:07.958\nIt's an investment opportunity. Think about that.\n\n00:11:07.958 --> 00:11:10.958\nIs anyone -- our banks, our investors --\n\n00:11:10.958 --> 00:11:11.958\nseriously thinking about going to Nigeria?\n\n00:11:11.958 --> 00:11:13.958\nIf you haven't, why not?\n\n00:11:13.958 --> 00:11:17.958\nWhat's going on in Nigeria? A couple of things.\n\n00:11:17.958 --> 00:11:21.958\nI want to talk about it from the perspective of capital markets.\n\n00:11:21.958 --> 00:11:24.958\nBellwether signs again.\n\n00:11:24.958 --> 00:11:28.958\nGuarantee Trust Bank recently issued the first Euro Bond\n\n00:11:28.958 --> 00:11:31.958\nout of Africa, and this excludes South Africa.\n\n00:11:31.958 --> 00:11:34.958\nBut the first Eurobond, the raising of international capital\n\n00:11:34.958 --> 00:11:37.958\noffshore, off its own balance sheet,\n\n00:11:37.958 --> 00:11:39.958\nwithout any sovereign backing --\n\n00:11:39.958 --> 00:11:43.958\nthat is an indication of the confidence that is taking place in that economy.\n\n00:11:43.958 --> 00:11:45.958\nWithout any sovereign backing,\n\n00:11:45.958 --> 00:11:47.958\na Nigerian company raising capital offshore.\n\n00:11:47.958 --> 00:11:48.958\nIt's just a sign of things to come.\n\n00:11:48.958 --> 00:11:53.958\nLooking at the oil industry, Africa provides 18 percent\n\n00:11:53.958 --> 00:11:57.958\nof the U.S.'s oil supply, with the Middle East just 16 percent.\n\n00:11:57.958 --> 00:11:59.958\nIt's an important strategic partner.\n\n00:11:59.958 --> 00:12:01.958\nLet's put Nigeria in perspective.\n\n00:12:01.958 --> 00:12:04.958\n2.2 to 2.4 million barrels of oil a day --\n\n00:12:04.958 --> 00:12:09.958\nthe same league as Kuwait, the same league as Venezuela.\n\n00:12:09.958 --> 00:12:12.958\nBut with Africa, let's start being careful about this.\n\n00:12:12.958 --> 00:12:14.958\nAnd Emeka and I have had these discussions.\n\n00:12:14.958 --> 00:12:18.958\nWe have to move away from what's called \"the curse of the commodities.\"\n\n00:12:18.958 --> 00:12:20.958\nBecause it's not about oil, it's not about commodities.\n\n00:12:20.958 --> 00:12:22.958\nFor Africa to truly be sustainable,\n\n00:12:22.958 --> 00:12:25.958\nwe have to move beyond to other industries.\n\n00:12:25.958 --> 00:12:27.958\nSo let's unpack those very quickly,\n\n00:12:27.958 --> 00:12:29.958\nand I'm going to move through these very, very, very fast\n\n00:12:29.958 --> 00:12:33.958\nbecause I can see that clock counting down.\n\n00:12:33.958 --> 00:12:36.958\nWhat else is going on there? Egypt.\n\n00:12:36.958 --> 00:12:39.958\nEgypt is launching a first large industrial zone --\n\n00:12:39.958 --> 00:12:41.958\n2.8 billion investment.\n\n00:12:41.958 --> 00:12:43.958\nThe announcement just came out the last few weeks.\n\n00:12:43.958 --> 00:12:47.958\nClose to the Mediterranean, near Alexandria --\n\n00:12:47.958 --> 00:12:49.958\ntextiles, petrochemicals.\n\n00:12:49.958 --> 00:12:53.958\nIt's being managed by a Singaporean-based management company.\n\n00:12:53.958 --> 00:12:56.958\nSo they want to emerge as an industrial powerhouse\n\n00:12:56.958 --> 00:12:58.958\nacross the industries -- away from oil.\n\n00:12:58.958 --> 00:13:01.958\nLet's look at agriculture. Let's look at forestry.\n\n00:13:01.958 --> 00:13:02.958\nWhat's going on there?\n\n00:13:02.958 --> 00:13:06.958\nIn Tanzania last week, we had the launch\n\n00:13:06.958 --> 00:13:10.958\nof the East African Organic Produce Standard.\n\n00:13:10.958 --> 00:13:15.958\nAgain, gathering together farmers, gathering together stakeholders\n\n00:13:15.958 --> 00:13:22.958\nin East Africa to get standards for organic produce. Better prices.\n\n00:13:22.958 --> 00:13:25.958\nIt ties in with small-scale farmers\n\n00:13:25.958 --> 00:13:30.958\nin terms of no pesticides, no fertilizers.\n\n00:13:30.958 --> 00:13:35.958\nAgain, opportunity to tackle markets to get that higher price.\n\n00:13:35.958 --> 00:13:37.958\nUganda: the New Forest Company,\n\n00:13:37.958 --> 00:13:43.958\nreplanting and redeveloping their forests. Why is that important?\n\n00:13:43.958 --> 00:13:46.958\nAs the energy needs are met and electricity is needed [we will need]\n\n00:13:46.958 --> 00:13:48.958\npoles for rolling out electricity.\n\n00:13:48.958 --> 00:13:50.958\nBut here is the sweetener in the deal.\n\n00:13:50.958 --> 00:13:54.958\nThey're going to be tapping into carbon credits.\n\n00:13:54.958 --> 00:13:56.958\nLet's go back to Nigeria.\n\n00:13:56.958 --> 00:13:59.958\nThe banking sector has undergone tremendous transformation,\n\n00:13:59.958 --> 00:14:04.958\nfrom over 80 banks to 25 banks. Strengthening of the system.\n\n00:14:04.958 --> 00:14:09.958\nBut what's going on there? Only 10 percent of the country is banked.\n\n00:14:09.958 --> 00:14:12.958\nThe largest population in Africa is in Nigeria.\n\n00:14:12.958 --> 00:14:16.958\n135 million-plus people. Think about that.\n\n00:14:16.958 --> 00:14:21.958\nThere are only 700 ATMs in the country. Opportunity.\n\n00:14:21.958 --> 00:14:24.958\nThe same for telecoms across the country.\n\n00:14:24.958 --> 00:14:26.958\nNow let's look at the continent as a whole.\n\n00:14:26.958 --> 00:14:28.958\nPeople look at the roads, for example, and they'd say,\n\n00:14:28.958 --> 00:14:35.958\n\"Angola: 90 percent of roads are untarred. Ah, problem!\"\n\n00:14:35.958 --> 00:14:38.958\nIt's more expensive to transport goods. Prices of goods go up,\n\n00:14:38.958 --> 00:14:40.958\ninflation is affected.\n\n00:14:40.958 --> 00:14:43.958\nNigeria: 70 percent of roads are untarred. Zambia: 80 percent.\n\n00:14:43.958 --> 00:14:46.958\nIn general, more than 50 percent of roads are untarred.\n\n00:14:46.958 --> 00:14:51.958\nThis is an opportunity! Energy needs -- it's an opportunity.\n\n00:14:51.958 --> 00:14:54.958\nSo what are the signs that things are fundamentally changing?\n\n00:14:54.958 --> 00:14:57.958\nLet's look at the stock markets in Africa.\n\n00:14:57.958 --> 00:15:01.958\nIf I had to ask you, \"In 2005 what was the best performing stock market\n\n00:15:01.958 --> 00:15:06.958\nor stock exchange in the world?\" Would Egypt come to mind?\n\n00:15:06.958 --> 00:15:14.958\nIn 2005, the Egyptian stock exchange returned over 145 percent.\n\n00:15:14.958 --> 00:15:16.958\nWhat's going on in some of the other countries?\n\n00:15:16.958 --> 00:15:23.958\nLet's look at some 2006 numbers. Kenya: over 60 percent. Nigeria: over 40 percent.\n\n00:15:23.958 --> 00:15:26.958\nSouth Africa: in the 20 percents. High ones.\n\n00:15:26.958 --> 00:15:32.958\nThese are the trends that are taking place.\n\n00:15:32.958 --> 00:15:36.958\nBut in any investment decision, the key question is,\n\n00:15:36.958 --> 00:15:39.958\n\"What is my alternative investment?\"\n\n00:15:39.958 --> 00:15:43.958\nBecause in Africa today, we are competing globally for capital.\n\n00:15:43.958 --> 00:15:48.958\nAnd global capital is agnostic -- it has no loyalties.\n\n00:15:48.958 --> 00:15:52.958\nThere's an overhang of capital in the U.S., and the key is yield pickup.\n\n00:15:52.958 --> 00:15:55.958\nWhat Africa is providing is a diversification play,\n\n00:15:55.958 --> 00:15:57.958\nand also opportunities for yield pickup for the investor\n\n00:15:57.958 --> 00:16:01.958\nthat's aware of what he or she is doing.\n\n00:16:01.958 --> 00:16:03.958\nNow, when looking at Africa vis-a-vis other things,\n\n00:16:03.958 --> 00:16:05.958\nand countries in Africa vis-a-vis other things,\n\n00:16:05.958 --> 00:16:07.958\ncomparisons become important.\n\n00:16:07.958 --> 00:16:10.958\n10 years ago there, were very few countries\n\n00:16:10.958 --> 00:16:11.958\nthat received sovereign ratings from\n\n00:16:11.958 --> 00:16:14.958\nthe Standard &amp; Poors, Moody's and Fitch's.\n\n00:16:14.958 --> 00:16:18.958\nToday, 16 African countries and growing\n\n00:16:18.958 --> 00:16:21.958\nhave sovereign country ratings. What does this mean?\n\n00:16:21.958 --> 00:16:24.958\nTake Nigeria again: double B-minus --\n\n00:16:24.958 --> 00:16:29.958\nin the league of Ukraine and Turkey. Immediately we have a comparison.\n\n00:16:29.958 --> 00:16:32.958\nThe backbone of making investment decisions\n\n00:16:32.958 --> 00:16:34.958\nfor global holders of capital.\n\n00:16:34.958 --> 00:16:41.958\nSome other figures. South Africa: triple B-plus. Botswana: A-plus.\n\n00:16:41.958 --> 00:16:44.958\nBakino Faso: B-minus. And so on.\n\n00:16:44.958 --> 00:16:49.958\nIn fact, one of the big agencies is setting up an office in Africa.\n\n00:16:49.958 --> 00:16:55.958\nWhy are they doing that? Because they expect investment to follow.\n\n00:16:55.958 --> 00:16:57.958\nSo one of the big bellwethers,\n\n00:16:57.958 --> 00:17:00.958\nand one of my final points I want to mention, is\n\n00:17:00.958 --> 00:17:02.958\nthe interesting thing I read is that CNBC\n\n00:17:02.958 --> 00:17:07.958\nhas launched their first African channel. Why is CNBC doing this?\n\n00:17:07.958 --> 00:17:11.958\nIt's the 24-hour rolling African news channel.\n\n00:17:11.958 --> 00:17:14.958\nThey're doing it because they are expecting things to happen.\n\n00:17:14.958 --> 00:17:18.958\nMe and you, the investments we are going to be making,\n\n00:17:18.958 --> 00:17:19.958\nthe investments the world is going to be making --\n\n00:17:19.958 --> 00:17:23.958\nthat's the 24-hour news channel dedicated to Africa.\n\n00:17:23.958 --> 00:17:28.958\nSo that's the change that's coming down the pipeline.\n\n00:17:28.958 --> 00:17:33.958\nSo in conclusion, I want to turn back to that very slide\n\n00:17:33.958 --> 00:17:38.958\nthat made such a deep impact on me all those years ago.\n\n00:17:38.958 --> 00:17:44.958\nThis time [I'll] give you the entire picture that I saw in 2002,\n\n00:17:44.958 --> 00:17:49.958\nand ask you that when you think about what your role can be in Africa,\n\n00:17:49.958 --> 00:17:53.958\nthink about your journey in terms of bringing light to this continent.\n\n00:17:53.958 --> 00:17:56.958\nBecause there are amazing opportunities available.\n\n00:17:56.958 --> 00:17:58.958\nAnd think about the concept of transformation\n\n00:17:58.958 --> 00:18:00.958\nin the back of your mind\n\n00:18:00.958 --> 00:18:04.958\nbecause things can be turned around rather quickly.\n\n00:18:04.958 --> 00:18:11.958\nIn 1899, Joseph Conrad released \"The Heart of Darkness,\"\n\n00:18:11.958 --> 00:18:18.958\na tale of grim horror along the Congo River.\n\n00:18:18.958 --> 00:18:23.958\nIf one looks carefully, on the Congo River\n\n00:18:23.958 --> 00:18:27.958\nis one of those bright lights. And that's the very Congo river\n\n00:18:27.958 --> 00:18:30.958\ngenerating light -- the old heart of darkness\n\n00:18:30.958 --> 00:18:33.958\nnow generating light with hydro-electric power.\n\n00:18:33.958 --> 00:18:36.958\nThat is a transformation in power of ideas.\n\n00:18:36.958 --> 00:18:38.958\nSo the next step, over the next four days,\n\n00:18:38.958 --> 00:18:41.958\nis us exploring more of these ideas.\n\n00:18:41.958 --> 00:18:44.958\nAnd perchance, if you can always keep this picture in your mind,\n\n00:18:44.958 --> 00:18:49.958\nthat when we convene maybe in the distant future, in 2020,\n\n00:18:49.958 --> 00:18:51.958\nthat picture will look very different.\n\n00:18:51.958 --> 00:18:53.958\nThank you.\n\n00:18:53.958 --> 00:18:55.958\n(Applause)"}, {"title": "How to educate leaders? Liberal arts", "duration": "1051", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/patrick_awuah_on_educating_leaders", "transcript": "Like many of you here, I am trying to contribute towards a renaissance in Africa. The question of transformation in Africa really is a question of leadership. Africa can only be transformed by enlightened leaders. And it is my contention that the manner in which we educate our leaders is fundamental to progress on this continent. I want to tell you some stories that explain my view. We all heard about the importance of stories yesterday. An American friend of mine this year volunteered as a nurse in Ghana, and in a period of three months she came to a conclusion about the state of leadership in Africa that had taken me over a decade to reach. Twice she was involved in surgeries where they lost power at the hospital. The emergency generators did not start. There was not a flashlight, not a lantern, not a candle \u2014 pitch black. The patient's cut open, twice. The first time it was a C-section. Thankfully, baby was out \u2014 mother and child survived.The second time was a procedure that involved local anesthesia. Anesthetic wears off. The patient feels pain. He's crying. He's screaming. He's praying. Pitch black. Not a candle, not a flashlight. And that hospital could have afforded flashlights. They could have afforded to purchase these things, but they didn't. And it happened twice. Another time, she watched in horror as nurses watched a patient die because they refused to give her oxygen that they had. And so three months later, just before she returned to the United States, nurses in Accra go on strike. And her recommendation is take this opportunity to fire everyone, start all over again. Start all over again.Now what does this have to do with leadership? You see, the folks at the ministry of health, the hospital administrators, the doctors, the nurses \u2014 they are among just five percent of their peers who get an education after secondary school. They are the elite. They are our leaders. Their decisions, their actions matter. And when they fail, a nation literally suffers. So when I speak of leadership, I'm not talking about just political leaders. We've heard a lot about that. I'm talking about the elite. Those who've been trained, whose job it is to be the guardians of their society. The lawyers, the judges, the policemen, the doctors, the engineers, the civil servants \u2014 those are the leaders. And we need to train them right.Now, my first pointed and memorable experience with leadership in Ghana occurred when I was 16 years old. We had just had a military coup, and soldiers were pervasive in our society. They were a pervasive presence. And one day I go to the airport to meet my father, and as I walk up this grassy slope from the car park to the terminal building, I'm stopped by two soldiers wielding AK-47 assault weapons. And they asked me to join a crowd of people that were running up and down this embankment. Why? Because the path I had taken was considered out of bounds. No sign to this effect.Now, I was 16. I was very worried about what my peers at school might think if they saw me running up and down this hill. I was especially concerned of what the girls might think. And so I started to argue with these men. It was a little reckless, but you know, I was 16. I got lucky. A Ghana Airways pilot falls into the same predicament. Because of his uniform they speak to him differently, and they explain to him that they're just following orders. So he takes their radio, talks to their boss, and gets us all released. What lessons would you take from an experience like this? Several, for me. Leadership matters. Those men are following the orders of a superior officer. I learned something about courage. It was important not to look at those guns. And I also learned that it can be helpful to think about girls.(Laughter)So a few years after this event, I leave Ghana on a scholarship to go to Swarthmore College for my education. It was a breath of fresh air. You know, the faculty there didn't want us to memorize information and repeat back to them as I was used to back in Ghana. They wanted us to think critically. They wanted us to be analytical. They wanted us to be concerned about social issues. In my economics classes I got high marks for my understanding of basic economics. But I learned something more profound than that, which is that the leaders \u2014 the managers of Ghana's economy \u2014 were making breathtakingly bad decisions that had brought our economy to the brink of collapse. And so here was this lesson again \u2014 leadership matters. It matters a great deal.But I didn't really fully understand what had happened to me at Swarthmore. I had an inkling, but I didn't fully realize it until I went out into the workplace and I went to work at Microsoft Corporation. And I was part of this team \u2014 this thinking, learning team whose job it was to design and implement new software that created value in the world. And it was brilliant to be part of this team. It was brilliant. And I realized just what had happened to me at Swarthmore, this transformation \u2014 the ability to confront problems, complex problems, and to design solutions to those problems. The ability to create is the most empowering thing that can happen to an individual. And I was part of that.Now, while I was at Microsoft, the annual revenues of that company grew larger than the GDP of the Republic of Ghana. And by the way, it's continued to. The gap has widened since I left. Now, I've already spoken about one of the reasons why this has occurred. I mean, it's the people there who are so hardworking, persistent, creative, empowered. But there were also some external factors: free markets, the rule of law, infrastructure. These things were provided by institutions run by the people that I call leaders. And those leaders did not emerge spontaneously. Somebody trained them to do the work that they do. Now, while I was at Microsoft, this funny thing happened. I became a parent. And for the first time, Africa mattered more to me than ever before. Because I realized that the state of the African continent would matter to my children and their children. That the state of the world \u2014 the state of the world depends on what's happening to Africa, as far as my kids would be concerned.And at this time, when I was going through what I call my \"pre-mid-life crisis,\" Africa was a mess. Somalia had disintegrated into anarchy. Rwanda was in the throes of this genocidal war. And it seemed to me that that was the wrong direction, and I needed to be back helping. I couldn't just stay in Seattle and raise my kids in an upper-middle class neighborhood and feel good about it. This was not the world that I'd want my children to grow up in. So I decided to get engaged, and the first thing that I did was to come back to Ghana and talk with a lot of people and really try to understand what the real issues were. And three things kept coming up for every problem: corruption, weak institutions and the people who run them \u2014 the leaders.Now, I was a little scared because when you see those three problems, they seem really hard to deal with. And they might say, \"Look, don't even try.\" But, for me, I asked the question, \"Well, where are these leaders coming from? What is it about Ghana that produces leaders that are unethical or unable to solve problems?\" So I went to look at what was happening in our educational system. And it was the same \u2014 learning by rote \u2014 from primary school through graduate school. Very little emphasis on ethics, and the typical graduate from a university in Ghana has a stronger sense of entitlement than a sense of responsibility. This is wrong.So I decided to engage this particular problem. Because it seems to me that every society, every society, must be very intentional about how it trains its leaders. And Ghana was not paying enough attention. And this is true across sub-Saharan Africa, actually. So this is what I'm doing now. I'm trying to bring the experience that I had at Swarthmore to Africa. I wish there was a liberal arts college in every African country. I think it would make a huge difference. And what Ashesi University is trying to do is to train a new generation of ethical, entrepreneurial leaders. We're trying to train leaders of exceptional integrity, who have the ability to confront the complex problems, ask the right questions, and come up with workable solutions.I'll admit that there are times when it seems like \"Mission: Impossible,\" but we must believe that these kids are smart. That if we involve them in their education, if we have them discuss the real issues that they confront \u2014 that our whole society confronts \u2014 and if we give them skills that enable them to engage the real world, that magic will happen. Now, a month into this project, we'd just started classes. And a month into it, I come to the office, and I have this email from one of our students. And it said, very simply, \"I am thinking now.\" And he signs off, \"Thank you.\" It's such a simple statement. But I was moved almost to tears because I understood what was happening to this young man. And it is an awesome thing to be a part of empowering someone in this way. I am thinking now.This year we challenged our students to craft an honor code themselves. There's a very vibrant debate going on on campus now over whether they should have an honor code, and if so, what it should look like. One of the students asked a question that just warmed my heart. Can we create a perfect society? Her understanding that a student-crafted honor code constitutes a reach towards perfection is incredible. Now, we cannot achieve perfection, but if we reach for it, then we can achieve excellence. I don't know ultimately what they will do. I don't know whether they will decide to have this honor code. But the conversation they're having now \u2014 about what their good society should look like, what their excellent society should look like, is a really good thing.Am I out of time? OK. Now, I just wanted to leave that slide up because it's important that we think about it. I'm very excited about the fact that every student at Ashesi University does community service before they graduate. That for many of them, it has been a life-altering experience. These young future leaders are beginning to understand the real business of leadership, the real privilege of leadership, which is after all to serve humanity. I am even more thrilled by the fact that least year our student body elected a woman to be the head of Student Government. It's the first time in the history of Ghana that a woman has been elected head of Student Government at any university. It says a lot about her. It says a lot about the culture that's forming on campus. It says a lot about her peers who elected her. She won with 75 percent of the vote.And it gives me a lot of hope. It turns out that corporate West Africa also appreciates what's happening with our students. We've graduated two classes of students to date. And every single one of them has been placed. And we're getting great reports back from corporate Ghana, corporate West Africa, and the things that they're most impressed about is work ethic. You know, that passion for what they're doing. The persistence, their ability to deal with ambiguity, their ability to tackle problems that they haven't seen before. This is good because over the past five years, there have been times when I've felt this is \"Mission: Impossible.\"And it's just wonderful to see these glimmers of the promise of what can happen if we train our kids right. I think that the current and future leaders of Africa have an incredible opportunity to drive a major renaissance on the continent. It's an incredible opportunity. There aren't very many more opportunities like this in the world. I believe that Africa has reached an inflection point with a march of democracy and free markets across the continent. We have reached a moment from which can emerge a great society within one generation. It will depend on inspired leadership. And it is my contention that the manner in which we train our leaders will make all the difference. Thank you, and God bless.(Applause)", "id": 156, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:12.958 --> 00:00:17.958\nLike many of you here, I am trying to contribute\n\n00:00:17.958 --> 00:00:20.958\ntowards a renaissance in Africa.\n\n00:00:20.958 --> 00:00:22.958\nThe question of transformation in Africa\n\n00:00:22.958 --> 00:00:24.958\nreally is a question of leadership.\n\n00:00:24.958 --> 00:00:29.958\nAfrica can only be transformed by enlightened leaders.\n\n00:00:29.958 --> 00:00:31.958\nAnd it is my contention that the manner in which\n\n00:00:31.958 --> 00:00:35.958\nwe educate our leaders is fundamental\n\n00:00:35.958 --> 00:00:39.958\nto progress on this continent.\n\n00:00:39.958 --> 00:00:44.958\nI want to tell you some stories that explain my view.\n\n00:00:44.958 --> 00:00:48.958\nWe all heard about the importance of stories yesterday.\n\n00:00:48.958 --> 00:00:53.958\nAn American friend of mine this year volunteered as a nurse in Ghana,\n\n00:00:53.958 --> 00:00:56.958\nand in a period of three months she came to a conclusion\n\n00:00:56.958 --> 00:00:59.958\nabout the state of leadership in Africa\n\n00:00:59.958 --> 00:01:02.958\nthat had taken me over a decade to reach.\n\n00:01:02.958 --> 00:01:05.958\nTwice she was involved in surgeries\n\n00:01:05.958 --> 00:01:10.958\nwhere they lost power at the hospital.\n\n00:01:10.958 --> 00:01:13.958\nThe emergency generators did not start.\n\n00:01:13.958 --> 00:01:18.958\nThere was not a flashlight, not a lantern, not a candle --\n\n00:01:18.958 --> 00:01:19.958\npitch black.\n\n00:01:19.958 --> 00:01:24.958\nThe patient's cut open, twice.\n\n00:01:24.958 --> 00:01:28.958\nThe first time it was a C-section.\n\n00:01:28.958 --> 00:01:33.958\nThankfully, baby was out -- mother and child survived.\n\n00:01:33.958 --> 00:01:38.958\nThe second time was a procedure that involved local anesthesia.\n\n00:01:38.958 --> 00:01:41.958\nAnesthetic wears off.

Because the path I had taken was considered out of bounds.\n\n00:04:21.958 --> 00:04:24.958\nNo sign to this effect.\n\n00:04:24.958 --> 00:04:28.958\nNow, I was 16. I was very worried about\n\n00:04:28.958 --> 00:04:30.958\nwhat my peers at school might think\n\n00:04:30.958 --> 00:04:32.958\nif they saw me running up and down this hill.\n\n00:04:32.958 --> 00:04:37.958\nI was especially concerned of what the girls might think.\n\n00:04:37.958 --> 00:04:39.958\nAnd so I started to argue with these men.\n\n00:04:39.958 --> 00:04:41.958\nIt was a little reckless, but you know, I was 16.\n\n00:04:41.958 --> 00:04:43.958\nI got lucky.\n\n00:04:43.958 --> 00:04:47.958\nA Ghana Airways pilot falls into the same predicament.\n\n00:04:47.958 --> 00:04:49.958\nBecause of his uniform they speak to him differently,\n\n00:04:49.958 --> 00:04:52.958\nand they explain to him that they're just following orders.\n\n00:04:52.958 --> 00:04:55.958\nSo he takes their radio, talks to their boss,\n\n00:04:55.958 --> 00:04:57.958\nand gets us all released.\n\n00:04:57.958 --> 00:05:00.958\nWhat lessons would you take from an experience like this?\n\n00:05:00.958 --> 00:05:02.958\nSeveral, for me.\n\n00:05:02.958 --> 00:05:05.958\nLeadership matters. Those men are following\n\n00:05:05.958 --> 00:05:09.958\nthe orders of a superior officer.\n\n00:05:09.958 --> 00:05:11.958\nI learned something about courage.\n\n00:05:11.958 --> 00:05:15.958\nIt was important not to look at those guns.\n\n00:05:15.958 --> 00:05:19.958\nAnd I also learned that it can be helpful to think about girls.\n\n00:05:19.958 --> 00:05:21.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:05:21.958 --> 00:05:27.958\nSo a few years after this event, I leave Ghana on a scholarship\n\n00:05:27.958 --> 00:05:30.958\nto go to Swarthmore College for my education.\n\n00:05:30.958 --> 00:05:33.958\nIt was a breath of fresh air.\n\n00:05:33.958 --> 00:05:38.958\nYou know, the faculty there didn't want us to memorize information\n\n00:05:38.958 --> 00:05:42.958\nand repeat back to them as I was used to back in Ghana.\n\n00:05:42.958 --> 00:05:44.958\nThey wanted us to think critically.\n\n00:05:44.958 --> 00:05:46.958\nThey wanted us to be analytical.\n\n00:05:46.958 --> 00:05:50.958\nThey wanted us to be concerned about social issues.\n\n00:05:50.958 --> 00:05:53.958\nIn my economics classes I got high marks\n\n00:05:53.958 --> 00:05:56.958\nfor my understanding of basic economics.\n\n00:05:56.958 --> 00:05:59.958\nBut I learned something more profound than that,\n\n00:05:59.958 --> 00:06:06.958\nwhich is that the leaders -- the managers of Ghana's economy --\n\n00:06:06.958 --> 00:06:09.958\nwere making breathtakingly bad decisions\n\n00:06:09.958 --> 00:06:13.958\nthat had brought our economy to the brink of collapse.\n\n00:06:13.958 --> 00:06:16.958\nAnd so here was this lesson again -- leadership matters.\n\n00:06:16.958 --> 00:06:19.958\nIt matters a great deal.\n\n00:06:19.958 --> 00:06:23.958\nBut I didn't really fully understand what had happened to me at Swarthmore.\n\n00:06:23.958 --> 00:06:26.958\nI had an inkling,\n\n00:06:26.958 --> 00:06:30.958\nbut I didn't fully realize it until I went out into the workplace\n\n00:06:30.958 --> 00:06:34.958\nand I went to work at Microsoft Corporation.\n\n00:06:34.958 --> 00:06:39.958\nAnd I was part of this team -- this thinking, learning team\n\n00:06:39.958 --> 00:06:44.958\nwhose job it was to design and implement new software\n\n00:06:44.958 --> 00:06:47.958\nthat created value in the world.\n\n00:06:47.958 --> 00:06:50.958\nAnd it was brilliant to be part of this team.\n\n00:06:50.958 --> 00:06:52.958\nIt was brilliant.\n\n00:06:52.958 --> 00:06:56.958\nAnd I realized just what had happened to me at Swarthmore,\n\n00:06:56.958 --> 00:06:58.958\nthis transformation --\n\n00:06:58.958 --> 00:07:03.958\nthe ability to confront problems, complex problems,\n\n00:07:03.958 --> 00:07:06.958\nand to design solutions to those problems.\n\n00:07:06.958 --> 00:07:10.958\nThe ability to create is the most empowering thing\n\n00:07:10.958 --> 00:07:12.958\nthat can happen to an individual.\n\n00:07:12.958 --> 00:07:15.958\nAnd I was part of that.\n\n00:07:15.958 --> 00:07:20.958\nNow, while I was at Microsoft, the annual revenues of that company\n\n00:07:20.958 --> 00:07:25.958\ngrew larger than the GDP of the Republic of Ghana.\n\n00:07:25.958 --> 00:07:28.958\nAnd by the way, it's continued to.\n\n00:07:28.958 --> 00:07:32.958\nThe gap has widened since I left.\n\n00:07:32.958 --> 00:07:36.958\nNow, I've already spoken about one of the reasons why this has occurred.\n\n00:07:36.958 --> 00:07:39.958\nI mean, it's the people there who are so hardworking,\n\n00:07:39.958 --> 00:07:45.958\npersistent, creative, empowered.\n\n00:07:45.958 --> 00:07:48.958\nBut there were also some external factors:\n\n00:07:48.958 --> 00:07:53.958\nfree markets, the rule of law, infrastructure.\n\n00:07:53.958 --> 00:07:57.958\nThese things were provided by institutions\n\n00:07:57.958 --> 00:08:01.958\nrun by the people that I call leaders.\n\n00:08:01.958 --> 00:08:04.958\nAnd those leaders did not emerge spontaneously.\n\n00:08:04.958 --> 00:08:09.958\nSomebody trained them to do the work that they do.\n\n00:08:09.958 --> 00:08:11.958\nNow, while I was at Microsoft, this funny thing happened.\n\n00:08:11.958 --> 00:08:13.958\nI became a parent.\n\n00:08:13.958 --> 00:08:18.958\nAnd for the first time, Africa mattered more to me than ever before.\n\n00:08:18.958 --> 00:08:22.958\nBecause I realized that the state of the African continent\n\n00:08:22.958 --> 00:08:26.958\nwould matter to my children and their children.\n\n00:08:26.958 --> 00:08:32.958\nThat the state of the world -- the state of the world\n\n00:08:32.958 --> 00:08:37.958\ndepends on what's happening to Africa,\n\n00:08:37.958 --> 00:08:39.958\nas far as my kids would be concerned.\n\n00:08:39.958 --> 00:08:43.958\nAnd at this time, when I was going through\n\n00:08:43.958 --> 00:08:47.958\nwhat I call my \"pre-mid-life crisis,\"\n\n00:08:47.958 --> 00:08:49.958\nAfrica was a mess.\n\n00:08:49.958 --> 00:08:51.958\nSomalia had disintegrated into anarchy.\n\n00:08:51.958 --> 00:08:55.958\nRwanda was in the throes of this genocidal war.\n\n00:08:55.958 --> 00:08:57.958\nAnd it seemed to me that that was the wrong direction,\n\n00:08:57.958 --> 00:09:00.958\nand I needed to be back helping.\n\n00:09:00.958 --> 00:09:04.958\nI couldn't just stay in Seattle and raise my kids\n\n00:09:04.958 --> 00:09:08.958\nin an upper-middle class neighborhood and feel good about it.\n\n00:09:08.958 --> 00:09:14.958\nThis was not the world that I'd want my children to grow up in.\n\n00:09:14.958 --> 00:09:18.958\nSo I decided to get engaged, and the first thing that I did\n\n00:09:18.958 --> 00:09:22.958\nwas to come back to Ghana and talk with a lot of people\n\n00:09:22.958 --> 00:09:26.958\nand really try to understand what the real issues were.\n\n00:09:26.958 --> 00:09:31.958\nAnd three things kept coming up for every problem:\n\n00:09:31.958 --> 00:09:34.958\ncorruption, weak institutions\n\n00:09:34.958 --> 00:09:38.958\nand the people who run them -- the leaders.\n\n00:09:38.958 --> 00:09:40.958\nNow, I was a little scared\n\n00:09:40.958 --> 00:09:42.958\nbecause when you see those three problems,\n\n00:09:42.958 --> 00:09:45.958\nthey seem really hard to deal with.\n\n00:09:45.958 --> 00:09:47.958\nAnd they might say, \"Look, don't even try.\"\n\n00:09:47.958 --> 00:09:50.958\nBut, for me, I asked the question,\n\n00:09:50.958 --> 00:09:54.958\n\"Well, where are these leaders coming from?\n\n00:09:54.958 --> 00:09:58.958\nWhat is it about Ghana that produces leaders\n\n00:09:58.958 --> 00:10:02.958\nthat are unethical or unable to solve problems?\"\n\n00:10:02.958 --> 00:10:05.958\nSo I went to look at what was happening in our educational system.\n\n00:10:05.958 --> 00:10:07.958\nAnd it was the same -- learning by rote --\n\n00:10:07.958 --> 00:10:11.958\nfrom primary school through graduate school.\n\n00:10:11.958 --> 00:10:16.958\nVery little emphasis on ethics,\n\n00:10:16.958 --> 00:10:20.958\nand the typical graduate\n\n00:10:20.958 --> 00:10:24.958\nfrom a university in Ghana has a stronger sense\n\n00:10:24.958 --> 00:10:28.958\nof entitlement than a sense of responsibility.\n\n00:10:28.958 --> 00:10:30.958\nThis is wrong.\n\n00:10:30.958 --> 00:10:35.958\nSo I decided to engage this particular problem.\n\n00:10:35.958 --> 00:10:41.958\nBecause it seems to me that every society, every society,\n\n00:10:41.958 --> 00:10:45.958\nmust be very intentional about how it trains its leaders.\n\n00:10:45.958 --> 00:10:48.958\nAnd Ghana was not paying enough attention.\n\n00:10:48.958 --> 00:10:55.958\nAnd this is true across sub-Saharan Africa, actually.\n\n00:10:55.958 --> 00:10:57.958\nSo this is what I'm doing now.\n\n00:10:57.958 --> 00:11:04.958\nI'm trying to bring the experience that I had at Swarthmore to Africa.\n\n00:11:04.958 --> 00:11:08.958\nI wish there was a liberal arts college in every African country.\n\n00:11:08.958 --> 00:11:11.958\nI think it would make a huge difference.\n\n00:11:11.958 --> 00:11:16.958\nAnd what Ashesi University is trying to do\n\n00:11:16.958 --> 00:11:23.958\nis to train a new generation of ethical, entrepreneurial leaders.\n\n00:11:23.958 --> 00:11:27.958\nWe're trying to train leaders of exceptional integrity,\n\n00:11:27.958 --> 00:11:30.958\nwho have the ability to confront the complex problems,\n\n00:11:30.958 --> 00:11:35.958\nask the right questions, and come up with workable solutions.\n\n00:11:35.958 --> 00:11:42.958\nI'll admit that there are times when it seems like \"Mission: Impossible,\"\n\n00:11:42.958 --> 00:11:46.958\nbut we must believe that these kids are smart.\n\n00:11:46.958 --> 00:11:49.958\nThat if we involve them in their education,\n\n00:11:49.958 --> 00:11:53.958\nif we have them discuss the real issues that they confront --\n\n00:11:53.958 --> 00:11:56.958\nthat our whole society confronts --\n\n00:11:56.958 --> 00:12:02.958\nand if we give them skills that enable them to engage the real world,\n\n00:12:02.958 --> 00:12:07.958\nthat magic will happen.\n\n00:12:07.958 --> 00:12:15.958\nNow, a month into this project, we'd just started classes.\n\n00:12:15.958 --> 00:12:18.958\nAnd a month into it, I come to the office,\n\n00:12:18.958 --> 00:12:21.958\nand I have this email from one of our students.\n\n00:12:21.958 --> 00:12:26.958\nAnd it said, very simply, \"I am thinking now.\"\n\n00:12:26.958 --> 00:12:31.958\nAnd he signs off, \"Thank you.\"\n\n00:12:31.958 --> 00:12:34.958\nIt's such a simple statement.\n\n00:12:34.958 --> 00:12:36.958\nBut I was moved almost to tears\n\n00:12:36.958 --> 00:12:41.958\nbecause I understood what was happening to this young man.\n\n00:12:41.958 --> 00:12:45.958\nAnd it is an awesome thing to be a part\n\n00:12:45.958 --> 00:12:50.958\nof empowering someone in this way.\n\n00:12:50.958 --> 00:12:54.958\nI am thinking now.\n\n00:12:54.958 --> 00:12:58.958\nThis year we challenged our students\n\n00:12:58.958 --> 00:13:01.958\nto craft an honor code themselves.\n\n00:13:01.958 --> 00:13:04.958\nThere's a very vibrant debate going on on campus now\n\n00:13:04.958 --> 00:13:07.958\nover whether they should have an honor code,\n\n00:13:07.958 --> 00:13:10.958\nand if so, what it should look like.\n\n00:13:10.958 --> 00:13:14.958\nOne of the students asked a question that just warmed my heart.\n\n00:13:14.958 --> 00:13:20.958\nCan we create a perfect society?\n\n00:13:20.958 --> 00:13:26.958\nHer understanding that a student-crafted honor code\n\n00:13:26.958 --> 00:13:32.958\nconstitutes a reach towards perfection is incredible.\n\n00:13:32.958 --> 00:13:34.958\nNow, we cannot achieve perfection,\n\n00:13:34.958 --> 00:13:40.958\nbut if we reach for it, then we can achieve excellence.\n\n00:13:40.958 --> 00:13:42.958\nI don't know ultimately what they will do.\n\n00:13:42.958 --> 00:13:46.958\nI don't know whether they will decide to have this honor code.\n\n00:13:46.958 --> 00:13:48.958\nBut the conversation they're having now --\n\n00:13:48.958 --> 00:13:52.958\nabout what their good society should look like,\n\n00:13:52.958 --> 00:13:55.958\nwhat their excellent society should look like,\n\n00:13:55.958 --> 00:14:01.958\nis a really good thing.\n\n00:14:01.958 --> 00:14:07.958\nAm I out of time? OK.\n\n00:14:07.958 --> 00:14:13.958\nNow, I just wanted to leave that slide up\n\n00:14:13.958 --> 00:14:16.958\nbecause it's important that we think about it.\n\n00:14:16.958 --> 00:14:19.958\nI'm very excited about the fact\n\n00:14:19.958 --> 00:14:25.958\nthat every student at Ashesi University does community service before they graduate.\n\n00:14:25.958 --> 00:14:30.958\nThat for many of them, it has been a life-altering experience.\n\n00:14:30.958 --> 00:14:38.958\nThese young future leaders are beginning to understand\n\n00:14:38.958 --> 00:14:40.958\nthe real business of leadership,\n\n00:14:40.958 --> 00:14:42.958\nthe real privilege of leadership,\n\n00:14:42.958 --> 00:14:47.958\nwhich is after all to serve humanity.\n\n00:14:47.958 --> 00:14:52.958\nI am even more thrilled by the fact that least year\n\n00:14:52.958 --> 00:14:54.958\nour student body elected a woman\n\n00:14:54.958 --> 00:14:58.958\nto be the head of Student Government.\n\n00:14:58.958 --> 00:15:01.958\nIt's the first time in the history of Ghana\n\n00:15:01.958 --> 00:15:05.958\nthat a woman has been elected head of Student Government\n\n00:15:05.958 --> 00:15:08.958\nat any university.\n\n00:15:08.958 --> 00:15:10.958\nIt says a lot about her.\n\n00:15:10.958 --> 00:15:15.958\nIt says a lot about the culture that's forming on campus.\n\n00:15:15.958 --> 00:15:18.958\nIt says a lot about her peers who elected her.\n\n00:15:18.958 --> 00:15:24.958\nShe won with 75 percent of the vote.\n\n00:15:24.958 --> 00:15:27.958\nAnd it gives me a lot of hope.\n\n00:15:27.958 --> 00:15:30.958\nIt turns out that corporate West Africa\n\n00:15:30.958 --> 00:15:34.958\nalso appreciates what's happening with our students.\n\n00:15:34.958 --> 00:15:38.958\nWe've graduated two classes of students to date.\n\n00:15:38.958 --> 00:15:41.958\nAnd every single one of them has been placed.\n\n00:15:41.958 --> 00:15:43.958\nAnd we're getting great reports back\n\n00:15:43.958 --> 00:15:47.958\nfrom corporate Ghana, corporate West Africa,\n\n00:15:47.958 --> 00:15:52.958\nand the things that they're most impressed about is work ethic.\n\n00:15:52.958 --> 00:15:56.958\nYou know, that passion for what they're doing.\n\n00:15:56.958 --> 00:16:00.958\nThe persistence, their ability to deal with ambiguity,\n\n00:16:00.958 --> 00:16:06.958\ntheir ability to tackle problems that they haven't seen before.\n\n00:16:06.958 --> 00:16:10.958\nThis is good because\n\n00:16:10.958 --> 00:16:13.958\nover the past five years, there have been times\n\n00:16:13.958 --> 00:16:16.958\nwhen I've felt this is \"Mission: Impossible.\"\n\n00:16:16.958 --> 00:16:19.958\nAnd it's just wonderful to see these glimmers\n\n00:16:19.958 --> 00:16:26.958\nof the promise of what can happen if we train our kids right.\n\n00:16:26.958 --> 00:16:30.958\nI think that the current and future leaders of Africa\n\n00:16:30.958 --> 00:16:33.958\nhave an incredible opportunity\n\n00:16:33.958 --> 00:16:36.958\nto drive a major renaissance on the continent.\n\n00:16:36.958 --> 00:16:38.958\nIt's an incredible opportunity.\n\n00:16:38.958 --> 00:16:42.958\nThere aren't very many more opportunities like this in the world.\n\n00:16:42.958 --> 00:16:50.958\nI believe that Africa has reached an inflection point\n\n00:16:50.958 --> 00:16:54.958\nwith a march of democracy and free markets across the continent.\n\n00:16:54.958 --> 00:16:57.958\nWe have reached a moment from which can emerge\n\n00:16:57.958 --> 00:17:01.958\na great society within one generation.\n\n00:17:01.958 --> 00:17:06.958\nIt will depend on inspired leadership.\n\n00:17:06.958 --> 00:17:12.958\nAnd it is my contention that the manner in which we train our leaders\n\n00:17:12.958 --> 00:17:13.958\nwill make all the difference.\n\n00:17:13.958 --> 00:17:15.958\nThank you, and God bless.\n\n00:17:15.958 --> 00:17:23.958\n(Applause)"}, {"title": "Telling stories from Africa", "duration": "1056", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/chris_abani_on_the_stories_of_africa", "transcript": "I just heard the best joke about Bond Emeruwa. I was having lunch with him just a few minutes ago, and a Nigerian journalist comes \u2014 and this will only make sense if you've ever watched a James Bond movie \u2014 and a Nigerian journalist comes up to him and goes, \"Aha, we meet again, Mr. Bond!\" (Laughter) It was great.So, I've got a little sheet of paper here, mostly because I'm Nigerian and if you leave me alone, I'll talk for like two hours.I just want to say good afternoon, good evening. It's been an incredible few days. It's downhill from now on. I wanted to thank Emeka and Chris. But also, most importantly, all the invisible people behind TED that you just see flitting around the whole place that have made sort of this space for such a diverse and robust conversation. It's really amazing. I've been in the audience. I'm a writer, and I've been watching people with the slide shows and scientists and bankers, and I've been feeling a bit like a gangsta rapper at a bar mitzvah. (Laughter) Like, what have I got to say about all this? And I was watching Jane [Goodall] yesterday, and I thought it was really great, and I was watching those incredible slides of the chimpanzees, and I thought, \"Wow. What if a chimpanzee could talk, you know? What would it say?\" My first thought was, \"Well, you know, there's George Bush.\" But then I thought, \"Why be rude to chimpanzees?\" I guess there goes my green card. (Laughter)There's been a lot of talk about narrative in Africa. And what's become increasingly clear to me is that we're talking about news stories about Africa; we're not really talking about African narratives. And it's important to make a distinction, because if the news is anything to go by, 40 percent of Americans can't \u2014 either can't afford health insurance or have the most inadequate health insurance, and have a president who, despite the protest of millions of his citizens \u2014 even his own Congress \u2014 continues to prosecute a senseless war. So if news is anything to go by, the U.S. is right there with Zimbabwe, right? Which it isn't really, is it? And talking about war, my girlfriend has this great t-shirt that says, \"Bombing for peace is like fucking for virginity.\" It's amazing, isn't it?The truth is, everything we know about America, everything Americans come to know about being American, isn't from the news. I live there. We don't go home at the end of the day and think, \"Well, I really know who I am now because the Wall Street Journal says that the Stock Exchange closed at this many points.\" What we know about how to be who we are comes from stories. It comes from the novels, the movies, the fashion magazines. It comes from popular culture.In other words, it's the agents of our imagination who really shape who we are. And this is important to remember, because in Africa the complicated questions we want to ask about what all of this means has been asked from the rock paintings of the San people, through the Sundiata epics of Mali, to modern contemporary literature. If you want to know about Africa, read our literature \u2014 and not just \"Things Fall Apart,\" because that would be like saying, \"I've read 'Gone with the Wind' and so I know everything about America.\" That's very important. There's a poem by Jack Gilbert called \"The Forgotten Dialect of the Heart.\" He says, \"When the Sumerian tablets were first translated, they were thought to be business records. But what if they were poems and psalms? My love is like twelve Ethiopian goats standing still in the morning light. Shiploads of thuja are what my body wants to say to your body. Giraffes are this desire in the dark.\" This is important.It's important because misreading is really the chance for complication and opportunity. The first Igbo Bible was translated from English in about the 1800s by Bishop Crowther, who was a Yoruba. And it's important to know Igbo is a tonal language, and so they'll say the word \"igwe\" and \"igwe\": same spelling, one means \"sky\" or \"heaven,\" and one means \"bicycle\" or \"iron.\" So \"God is in heaven surrounded by His angels\" was translated as \u2014 [Igbo]. And for some reason, in Cameroon, when they tried to translate the Bible into Cameroonian patois, they chose the Igbo version. And I'm not going to give you the patois translation; I'm going to make it standard English. Basically, it ends up as \"God is on a bicycle with his angels.\" This is good, because language complicates things.You know, we often think that language mirrors the world in which we live, and I find that's not true. The language actually makes the world in which we live. Language is not \u2014 I mean, things don't have any mutable value by themselves; we ascribe them a value. And language can't be understood in its abstraction. It can only be understood in the context of story, and everything, all of this is story. And it's important to remember that, because if we don't, then we become ahistorical. We've had a lot of \u2014 a parade of amazing ideas here. But these are not new to Africa. Nigeria got its independence in 1960. The first time the possibility for independence was discussed was in 1922, following the Aba women's market riots. In 1967, in the middle of the Biafran-Nigerian Civil War, Dr. Njoku-Obi invented the Cholera vaccine. So, you know, the thing is to remember that because otherwise, 10 years from now, we'll be back here trying to tell this story again.So, what it says to me then is that it's not really \u2014 the problem isn't really the stories that are being told or which stories are being told, the problem really is the terms of humanity that we're willing to bring to complicate every story, and that's really what it's all about. Let me tell you a Nigerian joke. Well, it's just a joke, anyway. So there's Tom, Dick and Harry and they're working construction. And Tom opens up his lunch box and there's rice in it, and he goes on this rant about, \"Twenty years, my wife has been packing rice for lunch. If she does it again tomorrow, I'm going to throw myself off this building and kill myself.\" And Dick and Harry repeat this. The next day, Tom opens his lunchbox, there's rice, so he throws himself off and kills himself, and Tom, Dick and Harry follow. And now the inquest \u2014 you know, Tom's wife and Dick's wife are distraught. They wished they'd not packed rice. But Harry's wife is confused, because she said, \"You know, Harry had been packing his own lunch for 20 years.\" (Laughter)This seemingly innocent joke, when I heard it as a child in Nigeria, was told about Igbo, Yoruba and Hausa, with the Hausa being Harry. So what seems like an eccentric if tragic joke about Harry becomes a way to spread ethnic hatred. My father was educated in Cork, in the University of Cork, in the '50s. In fact, every time I read in Ireland, people get me all mistaken and they say, \"Oh, this is Chris O'Barney from Cork.\" But he was also in Oxford in the '50s, and yet growing up as a child in Nigeria, my father used to say to me, \"You must never eat or drink in a Yoruba person's house because they will poison you.\" It makes sense now when I think about it, because if you'd known my father, you would've wanted to poison him too. (Laughter)So I was born in 1966, at the beginning of the Biafran-Nigerian Civil War, and the war ended after three years. And I was growing up in school and the federal government didn't want us taught about the history of the war, because they thought it probably would make us generate a new generation of rebels. So I had a very inventive teacher, a Pakistani Muslim, who wanted to teach us about this. So what he did was to teach us Jewish Holocaust history, and so huddled around books with photographs of people in Auschwitz, I learned the melancholic history of my people through the melancholic history of another people. I mean, picture this \u2014 really picture this. A Pakistani Muslim teaching Jewish Holocaust history to young Igbo children.Story is powerful. Story is fluid and it belongs to nobody. And it should come as no surprise that my first novel at 16 was about Neo-Nazis taking over Nigeria to institute the Fourth Reich. It makes perfect sense. And they were to blow up strategic targets and take over the country, and they were foiled by a Nigerian James Bond called Coyote Williams, and a Jewish Nazi hunter. And it happened over four continents. And when the book came out, I was heralded as Africa's answer to Frederick Forsyth, which is a dubious honor at best. But also, the book was launched in time for me to be accused of constructing the blueprint for a foiled coup attempt. So at 18, I was bonded off to prison in Nigeria.I grew up very privileged, and it's important to talk about privilege, because we don't talk about it here. A lot of us are very privileged. I grew up \u2014 servants, cars, televisions, all that stuff. My story of Nigeria growing up was very different from the story I encountered in prison, and I had no language for it. I was completely terrified, completely broken, and kept trying to find a new language, a new way to make sense of all of this. Six months after that, with no explanation, they let me go. Now for those of you who have seen me at the buffet tables know that it was because it was costing them too much to feed me. (Laughter) But I mean, I grew up with this incredible privilege, and not just me \u2014 millions of Nigerians grew up with books and libraries. In fact, we were talking last night about how all of the steamy novels of Harold Robbins had done more for sex education of horny teenage boys in Africa than any sex education programs ever had. All of those are gone.We are squandering the most valuable resource we have on this continent: the valuable resource of the imagination. In the film, \"Sometimes in April\" by Raoul Peck, Idris Elba is poised in a scene with his machete raised, and he's being forced by a crowd to chop up his best friend \u2014 fellow Rwandan Army officer, albeit a Tutsi \u2014 played by Fraser James. And Fraser's on his knees, arms tied behind his back, and he's crying. He's sniveling. It's a pitiful sight. And as we watch it, we are ashamed. And we want to say to Idris, \"Chop him up. Shut him up.\" And as Idris moves, Fraser screams, \"Stop! Please stop!\" Idris pauses, then he moves again, and Fraser says, \"Please! Please stop!\" And it's not the look of horror and terror on Fraser's face that stops Idris or us; it's the look in Fraser's eyes. It's one that says, \"Don't do this. And I'm not saying this to save myself, although this would be nice. I'm doing it to save you, because if you do this, you will be lost.\" To be so afraid that you're standing in the face of a death you can't escape and that you're soiling yourself and crying, but to say in that moment, as Fraser says to Idris, \"Tell my girlfriend I love her.\" In that moment, Fraser says, \"I am lost already, but not you ... not you.\" This is a redemption we can all aspire to.African narratives in the West, they proliferate. I really don't care anymore. I'm more interested in the stories we tell about ourselves \u2014 how as a writer, I find that African writers have always been the curators of our humanity on this continent. The question is, how do I balance narratives that are wonderful with narratives of wounds and self-loathing? And this is the difficulty that I face. I am trying to move beyond political rhetoric to a place of ethical questioning. I am asking us to balance the idea of our complete vulnerability with the complete notion of transformation of what is possible.As a young middle-class Nigerian activist, I launched myself along with a whole generation of us into the campaign to stop the government. And I asked millions of people, without questioning my right to do so, to go up against the government. And I watched them being locked up in prison and tear gassed. I justified it, and I said, \"This is the cost of revolution. Have I not myself been imprisoned? Have I not myself been beaten?\" It wasn't until later, when I was imprisoned again, that I understood the real meaning of torture, and how easy your humanity can be taken from you, for the time I was engaged in war, righteous, righteous war. Excuse me.Sometimes I can stand before the world \u2014 and when I say this, transformation is a difficult and slow process \u2014 sometimes I can stand before the world and say, \"My name is Chris Abani. I have been human six days, but only sometimes.\" But this is a good thing. It's never going to be easy. There are no answers. As I was telling Rachel from Google Earth, that I had challenged my students in America \u2014 I said, \"You don't know anything about Africa, you're all idiots.\" And so they said, \"Tell me about Africa, Professor Abani.\" So I went to Google Earth and learned about Africa. And the truth be told, this is it, isn't it? There are no essential Africans, and most of us are as completely ignorant as everyone else about the continent we come from, and yet we want to make profound statements about it. And I think if we can just admit that we're all trying to approximate the truth of our own communities, it will make for a much more nuanced and a much more interesting conversation. I want to believe that we can be agnostic about this, that we can rise above all of this.When I was 10, I read James Baldwin's \"Another Country,\" and that book broke me. Not because I was encountering homosexual sex and love for the first time, but because the way James wrote about it made it impossible for me to attach otherness to it. \"Here,\" Jimmy said. \"Here is love, all of it.\" The fact that it happens in \"Another Country\" takes you quite by surprise. My friend Ronald Gottesman says there are three kinds of people in the world: those who can count, and those who can't. (Laughter) He also says that the cause of all our trouble is the belief in an essential, pure identity: religious, ethnic, historical, ideological.I want to leave you with a poem by Yusef Komunyakaa that speaks to transformation. It's called \"Ode to the Drum,\" and I'll try and read it the way Yusef would be proud to hear it read. \"Gazelle, I killed you for your skin's exquisite touch, for how easy it is to be nailed to a board weathered raw as white butcher paper. Last night I heard my daughter praying for the meat here at my feet. You know it wasn't anger that made me stop my heart till the hammer fell. Weeks ago, you broke me as a woman once shattered me into a song beneath her weight, before you slouched into that grassy hush. And now I'm tightening lashes, shaped in hide as if around a ribcage, shaped like five bowstrings. Ghosts cannot slip back inside the body's drum. You've been seasoned by wind, dusk and sunlight. Pressure can make everything whole again. Brass nails tacked into the ebony wood, your face has been carved five times. I have to drive trouble in the hills. Trouble in the valley, and trouble by the river too. There is no palm wine, fish, salt, or calabash. Kadoom. Kadoom. Kadoom. Ka-doooom. Now I have beaten a song back into you. Rise and walk away like a panther.\" Thank you.

What would it say?\"\n\n00:01:37.958 --> 00:01:39.958\nMy first thought was, \"Well, you know, there's George Bush.\"\n\n00:01:39.958 --> 00:01:45.958\nBut then I thought, \"Why be rude to chimpanzees?\"\n\n00:01:45.958 --> 00:01:47.958\nI guess there goes my green card.\n\n00:01:47.958 --> 00:01:49.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:01:49.958 --> 00:01:52.958\nThere's been a lot of talk about narrative in Africa.\n\n00:01:52.958 --> 00:01:56.958\nAnd what's become increasingly clear to me is that\n\n00:01:56.958 --> 00:01:59.958\nwe're talking about news stories about Africa;\n\n00:01:59.958 --> 00:02:01.958\nwe're not really talking about African narratives.\n\n00:02:01.958 --> 00:02:05.958\nAnd it's important to make a distinction, because if the news is anything to go by,\n\n00:02:05.958 --> 00:02:11.958\n40 percent of Americans can't -- either can't afford health insurance\n\n00:02:11.958 --> 00:02:14.958\nor have the most inadequate health insurance,\n\n00:02:14.958 --> 00:02:17.958\nand have a president who, despite the protest\n\n00:02:17.958 --> 00:02:20.958\nof millions of his citizens -- even his own Congress --\n\n00:02:20.958 --> 00:02:23.958\ncontinues to prosecute a senseless war.\n\n00:02:23.958 --> 00:02:25.958\nSo if news is anything to go by,\n\n00:02:25.958 --> 00:02:28.958\nthe U.S. is right there with Zimbabwe, right?\n\n00:02:28.958 --> 00:02:32.958\nWhich it isn't really, is it?\n\n00:02:32.958 --> 00:02:34.958\nAnd talking about war, my girlfriend has this great t-shirt\n\n00:02:34.958 --> 00:02:39.958\nthat says, \"Bombing for peace is like fucking for virginity.\"\n\n00:02:39.958 --> 00:02:42.958\nIt's amazing, isn't it?\n\n00:02:42.958 --> 00:02:51.958\nThe truth is, everything we know about America,\n\n00:02:51.958 --> 00:02:53.958\neverything Americans come to know about being American,\n\n00:02:53.958 --> 00:02:55.958\nisn't from the news.\n\n00:02:55.958 --> 00:02:57.958\nI live there.\n\n00:02:57.958 --> 00:02:59.958\nWe don't go home at the end of the day and think,\n\n00:02:59.958 --> 00:03:00.958\n\"Well, I really know who I am now\n\n00:03:00.958 --> 00:03:04.958\nbecause the Wall Street Journal says that the Stock Exchange\n\n00:03:04.958 --> 00:03:06.958\nclosed at this many points.\"\n\n00:03:06.958 --> 00:03:09.958\nWhat we know about how to be who we are comes from stories.\n\n00:03:09.958 --> 00:03:12.958\nIt comes from the novels, the movies, the fashion magazines.\n\n00:03:12.958 --> 00:03:14.958\nIt comes from popular culture.\n\n00:03:14.958 --> 00:03:16.958\nIn other words, it's the agents of our imagination\n\n00:03:16.958 --> 00:03:20.958\nwho really shape who we are. And this is important to remember,\n\n00:03:20.958 --> 00:03:23.958\nbecause in Africa\n\n00:03:23.958 --> 00:03:27.958\nthe complicated questions we want to ask about\n\n00:03:27.958 --> 00:03:29.958\nwhat all of this means has been asked\n\n00:03:29.958 --> 00:03:33.958\nfrom the rock paintings of the San people,\n\n00:03:33.958 --> 00:03:37.958\nthrough the Sundiata epics of Mali, to modern contemporary literature.\n\n00:03:37.958 --> 00:03:40.958\nIf you want to know about Africa, read our literature --\n\n00:03:40.958 --> 00:03:44.958\nand not just \"Things Fall Apart,\" because that would be like saying,\n\n00:03:44.958 --> 00:03:48.958\n\"I've read 'Gone with the Wind' and so I know everything about America.\"\n\n00:03:48.958 --> 00:03:50.958\nThat's very important.\n\n00:03:50.958 --> 00:03:54.958\nThere's a poem by Jack Gilbert called \"The Forgotten Dialect of the Heart.\"\n\n00:03:54.958 --> 00:03:59.958\nHe says, \"When the Sumerian tablets were first translated,\n\n00:03:59.958 --> 00:04:02.958\nthey were thought to be business records.\n\n00:04:02.958 --> 00:04:04.958\nBut what if they were poems and psalms?\n\n00:04:04.958 --> 00:04:08.958\nMy love is like twelve Ethiopian goats\n\n00:04:08.958 --> 00:04:12.958\nstanding still in the morning light.\n\n00:04:12.958 --> 00:04:17.958\nShiploads of thuja are what my body wants to say to your body.\n\n00:04:17.958 --> 00:04:21.958\nGiraffes are this desire in the dark.\"\n\n00:04:21.958 --> 00:04:22.958\nThis is important.\n\n00:04:22.958 --> 00:04:25.958\nIt's important because misreading is really the chance\n\n00:04:25.958 --> 00:04:27.958\nfor complication and opportunity.\n\n00:04:27.958 --> 00:04:31.958\nThe first Igbo Bible was translated from English\n\n00:04:31.958 --> 00:04:33.958\nin about the 1800s by Bishop Crowther,\n\n00:04:33.958 --> 00:04:34.958\nwho was a Yoruba.\n\n00:04:34.958 --> 00:04:37.958\nAnd it's important to know Igbo is a tonal language,\n\n00:04:37.958 --> 00:04:41.958\nand so they'll say the word \"igwe\" and \"igwe\":\n\n00:04:41.958 --> 00:04:45.958\nsame spelling, one means \"sky\" or \"heaven,\"\n\n00:04:45.958 --> 00:04:48.958\nand one means \"bicycle\" or \"iron.\"\n\n00:04:48.958 --> 00:04:52.958\nSo \"God is in heaven surrounded by His angels\"\n\n00:04:52.958 --> 00:04:54.958\nwas translated as --\n\n00:04:54.958 --> 00:04:58.958\n[Igbo].\n\n00:04:58.958 --> 00:05:00.958\nAnd for some reason, in Cameroon, when they tried\n\n00:05:00.958 --> 00:05:02.958\nto translate the Bible into Cameroonian patois,\n\n00:05:02.958 --> 00:05:04.958\nthey chose the Igbo version.\n\n00:05:04.958 --> 00:05:06.958\nAnd I'm not going to give you the patois translation;\n\n00:05:06.958 --> 00:05:07.958\nI'm going to make it standard English.\n\n00:05:07.958 --> 00:05:14.958\nBasically, it ends up as \"God is on a bicycle with his angels.\"\n\n00:05:14.958 --> 00:05:19.958\nThis is good, because language complicates things.\n\n00:05:19.958 --> 00:05:21.958\nYou know, we often think that language mirrors\n\n00:05:21.958 --> 00:05:25.958\nthe world in which we live, and I find that's not true.\n\n00:05:25.958 --> 00:05:30.958\nThe language actually makes the world in which we live.\n\n00:05:30.958 --> 00:05:32.958\nLanguage is not -- I mean, things don't have\n\n00:05:32.958 --> 00:05:35.958\nany mutable value by themselves; we ascribe them a value.\n\n00:05:35.958 --> 00:05:38.958\nAnd language can't be understood in its abstraction.\n\n00:05:38.958 --> 00:05:40.958\nIt can only be understood in the context of story,\n\n00:05:40.958 --> 00:05:44.958\nand everything, all of this is story.\n\n00:05:44.958 --> 00:05:46.958\nAnd it's important to remember that,\n\n00:05:46.958 --> 00:05:50.958\nbecause if we don't, then we become ahistorical.\n\n00:05:50.958 --> 00:05:53.958\nWe've had a lot of -- a parade of amazing ideas here.\n\n00:05:53.958 --> 00:05:55.958\nBut these are not new to Africa.\n\n00:05:55.958 --> 00:05:58.958\nNigeria got its independence in 1960.\n\n00:05:58.958 --> 00:06:02.958\nThe first time the possibility for independence was discussed\n\n00:06:02.958 --> 00:06:06.958\nwas in 1922, following the Aba women's market riots.\n\n00:06:06.958 --> 00:06:10.958\nIn 1967, in the middle of the Biafran-Nigerian Civil War,\n\n00:06:10.958 --> 00:06:14.958\nDr. Njoku-Obi invented the Cholera vaccine.\n\n00:06:14.958 --> 00:06:16.958\nSo, you know, the thing is to remember that\n\n00:06:16.958 --> 00:06:18.958\nbecause otherwise, 10 years from now,\n\n00:06:18.958 --> 00:06:22.958\nwe'll be back here trying to tell this story again.\n\n00:06:22.958 --> 00:06:27.958\nSo, what it says to me then is that it's not really --\n\n00:06:27.958 --> 00:06:29.958\nthe problem isn't really the stories that are being told\n\n00:06:29.958 --> 00:06:31.958\nor which stories are being told,\n\n00:06:31.958 --> 00:06:34.958\nthe problem really is the terms of humanity\n\n00:06:34.958 --> 00:06:37.958\nthat we're willing to bring to complicate every story,\n\n00:06:37.958 --> 00:06:40.958\nand that's really what it's all about.\n\n00:06:40.958 --> 00:06:42.958\nLet me tell you a Nigerian joke.\n\n00:06:42.958 --> 00:06:44.958\nWell, it's just a joke, anyway.\n\n00:06:44.958 --> 00:06:48.958\nSo there's Tom, Dick and Harry and they're working construction.\n\n00:06:48.958 --> 00:06:51.958\nAnd Tom opens up his lunch box and there's rice in it,\n\n00:06:51.958 --> 00:06:53.958\nand he goes on this rant about, \"Twenty years,\n\n00:06:53.958 --> 00:06:55.958\nmy wife has been packing rice for lunch.\n\n00:06:55.958 --> 00:06:57.958\nIf she does it again tomorrow, I'm going to throw myself\n\n00:06:57.958 --> 00:06:59.958\noff this building and kill myself.\"\n\n00:06:59.958 --> 00:07:01.958\nAnd Dick and Harry repeat this.\n\n00:07:01.958 --> 00:07:03.958\nThe next day, Tom opens his lunchbox, there's rice,\n\n00:07:03.958 --> 00:07:05.958\nso he throws himself off and kills himself,\n\n00:07:05.958 --> 00:07:07.958\nand Tom, Dick and Harry follow.\n\n00:07:07.958 --> 00:07:09.958\nAnd now the inquest -- you know, Tom's wife\n\n00:07:09.958 --> 00:07:10.958\nand Dick's wife are distraught.\n\n00:07:10.958 --> 00:07:12.958\nThey wished they'd not packed rice.\n\n00:07:12.958 --> 00:07:15.958\nBut Harry's wife is confused, because she said, \"You know,\n\n00:07:15.958 --> 00:07:18.958\nHarry had been packing his own lunch for 20 years.\"\n\n00:07:18.958 --> 00:07:22.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:07:22.958 --> 00:07:27.958\nThis seemingly innocent joke, when I heard it as a child in Nigeria,\n\n00:07:27.958 --> 00:07:29.958\nwas told about Igbo, Yoruba and Hausa,\n\n00:07:29.958 --> 00:07:31.958\nwith the Hausa being Harry.\n\n00:07:31.958 --> 00:07:35.958\nSo what seems like an eccentric if tragic joke about Harry\n\n00:07:35.958 --> 00:07:39.958\nbecomes a way to spread ethnic hatred.\n\n00:07:39.958 --> 00:07:43.958\nMy father was educated in Cork, in the University of Cork, in the '50s.\n\n00:07:43.958 --> 00:07:45.958\nIn fact, every time I read in Ireland,\n\n00:07:45.958 --> 00:07:47.958\npeople get me all mistaken and they say,\n\n00:07:47.958 --> 00:07:49.958\n\"Oh, this is Chris O'Barney from Cork.\"\n\n00:07:49.958 --> 00:07:53.958\nBut he was also in Oxford in the '50s,\n\n00:07:53.958 --> 00:07:55.958\nand yet growing up as a child in Nigeria,\n\n00:07:55.958 --> 00:07:58.958\nmy father used to say to me, \"You must never eat or drink\n\n00:07:58.958 --> 00:08:03.958\nin a Yoruba person's house because they will poison you.\"\n\n00:08:03.958 --> 00:08:05.958\nIt makes sense now when I think about it,\n\n00:08:05.958 --> 00:08:06.958\nbecause if you'd known my father,\n\n00:08:06.958 --> 00:08:09.958\nyou would've wanted to poison him too.\n\n00:08:09.958 --> 00:08:14.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:08:14.958 --> 00:08:18.958\nSo I was born in 1966, at the beginning\n\n00:08:18.958 --> 00:08:24.958\nof the Biafran-Nigerian Civil War, and the war ended after three years.\n\n00:08:24.958 --> 00:08:27.958\nAnd I was growing up in school and the federal government\n\n00:08:27.958 --> 00:08:30.958\ndidn't want us taught about the history of the war,\n\n00:08:30.958 --> 00:08:33.958\nbecause they thought it probably would make us\n\n00:08:33.958 --> 00:08:35.958\ngenerate a new generation of rebels.\n\n00:08:35.958 --> 00:08:38.958\nSo I had a very inventive teacher, a Pakistani Muslim,\n\n00:08:38.958 --> 00:08:40.958\nwho wanted to teach us about this.\n\n00:08:40.958 --> 00:08:44.958\nSo what he did was to teach us Jewish Holocaust history,\n\n00:08:44.958 --> 00:08:49.958\nand so huddled around books with photographs of people in Auschwitz,\n\n00:08:49.958 --> 00:08:52.958\nI learned the melancholic history of my people\n\n00:08:52.958 --> 00:08:54.958\nthrough the melancholic history of another people.\n\n00:08:54.958 --> 00:08:56.958\nI mean, picture this -- really picture this.\n\n00:08:56.958 --> 00:09:01.958\nA Pakistani Muslim teaching Jewish Holocaust history\n\n00:09:01.958 --> 00:09:02.958\nto young Igbo children.\n\n00:09:02.958 --> 00:09:04.958\nStory is powerful.\n\n00:09:04.958 --> 00:09:06.958\nStory is fluid and it belongs to nobody.\n\n00:09:06.958 --> 00:09:08.958\nAnd it should come as no surprise\n\n00:09:08.958 --> 00:09:11.958\nthat my first novel at 16 was about Neo-Nazis\n\n00:09:11.958 --> 00:09:14.958\ntaking over Nigeria to institute the Fourth Reich.\n\n00:09:14.958 --> 00:09:15.958\nIt makes perfect sense.\n\n00:09:15.958 --> 00:09:19.958\nAnd they were to blow up strategic targets\n\n00:09:19.958 --> 00:09:21.958\nand take over the country, and they were foiled\n\n00:09:21.958 --> 00:09:25.958\nby a Nigerian James Bond called Coyote Williams,\n\n00:09:25.958 --> 00:09:28.958\nand a Jewish Nazi hunter.\n\n00:09:28.958 --> 00:09:29.958\nAnd it happened over four continents.\n\n00:09:29.958 --> 00:09:32.958\nAnd when the book came out, I was heralded as Africa's answer\n\n00:09:32.958 --> 00:09:36.958\nto Frederick Forsyth, which is a dubious honor at best.\n\n00:09:36.958 --> 00:09:39.958\nBut also, the book was launched in time for me to be accused\n\n00:09:39.958 --> 00:09:43.958\nof constructing the blueprint for a foiled coup attempt.\n\n00:09:43.958 --> 00:09:48.958\nSo at 18, I was bonded off to prison in Nigeria.\n\n00:09:48.958 --> 00:09:49.958\nI grew up very privileged, and it's important\n\n00:09:49.958 --> 00:09:52.958\nto talk about privilege, because we don't talk about it here.\n\n00:09:52.958 --> 00:09:54.958\nA lot of us are very privileged.\n\n00:09:54.958 --> 00:09:58.958\nI grew up -- servants, cars, televisions, all that stuff.\n\n00:09:58.958 --> 00:10:01.958\nMy story of Nigeria growing up was very different from the story\n\n00:10:01.958 --> 00:10:05.958\nI encountered in prison, and I had no language for it.\n\n00:10:05.958 --> 00:10:09.958\nI was completely terrified, completely broken,\n\n00:10:09.958 --> 00:10:13.958\nand kept trying to find a new language,\n\n00:10:13.958 --> 00:10:16.958\na new way to make sense of all of this.\n\n00:10:16.958 --> 00:10:19.958\nSix months after that, with no explanation,\n\n00:10:19.958 --> 00:10:20.958\nthey let me go.\n\n00:10:20.958 --> 00:10:22.958\nNow for those of you who have seen me at the buffet tables know\n\n00:10:22.958 --> 00:10:25.958\nthat it was because it was costing them too much to feed me.\n\n00:10:25.958 --> 00:10:34.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:10:34.958 --> 00:10:36.958\nBut I mean, I grew up with this incredible privilege,\n\n00:10:36.958 --> 00:10:38.958\nand not just me -- millions of Nigerians\n\n00:10:38.958 --> 00:10:40.958\ngrew up with books and libraries.\n\n00:10:40.958 --> 00:10:44.958\nIn fact, we were talking last night about how all\n\n00:10:44.958 --> 00:10:46.958\nof the steamy novels of Harold Robbins\n\n00:10:46.958 --> 00:10:50.958\nhad done more for sex education of horny teenage boys in Africa\n\n00:10:50.958 --> 00:10:54.958\nthan any sex education programs ever had.\n\n00:10:54.958 --> 00:10:56.958\nAll of those are gone.\n\n00:10:56.958 --> 00:10:58.958\nWe are squandering the most valuable resource\n\n00:10:58.958 --> 00:11:00.958\nwe have on this continent: the valuable resource\n\n00:11:00.958 --> 00:11:02.958\nof the imagination.\n\n00:11:02.958 --> 00:11:05.958\nIn the film, \"Sometimes in April\" by Raoul Peck,\n\n00:11:05.958 --> 00:11:09.958\nIdris Elba is poised in a scene with his machete raised,\n\n00:11:09.958 --> 00:11:13.958\nand he's being forced by a crowd to chop up his best friend --\n\n00:11:13.958 --> 00:11:16.958\nfellow Rwandan Army officer, albeit a Tutsi --\n\n00:11:16.958 --> 00:11:18.958\nplayed by Fraser James.\n\n00:11:18.958 --> 00:11:22.958\nAnd Fraser's on his knees, arms tied behind his back,\n\n00:11:22.958 --> 00:11:24.958\nand he's crying.\n\n00:11:24.958 --> 00:11:25.958\nHe's sniveling.\n\n00:11:25.958 --> 00:11:26.958\nIt's a pitiful sight.\n\n00:11:26.958 --> 00:11:31.958\nAnd as we watch it, we are ashamed.\n\n00:11:31.958 --> 00:11:34.958\nAnd we want to say to Idris, \"Chop him up.\n\n00:11:34.958 --> 00:11:36.958\nShut him up.\"\n\n00:11:36.958 --> 00:11:40.958\nAnd as Idris moves, Fraser screams, \"Stop!\n\n00:11:40.958 --> 00:11:42.958\nPlease stop!\"\n\n00:11:42.958 --> 00:11:45.958\nIdris pauses, then he moves again,\n\n00:11:45.958 --> 00:11:48.958\nand Fraser says, \"Please!\n\n00:11:48.958 --> 00:11:50.958\nPlease stop!\"\n\n00:11:50.958 --> 00:11:56.958\nAnd it's not the look of horror and terror on Fraser's face that stops Idris or us;\n\n00:11:56.958 --> 00:11:58.958\nit's the look in Fraser's eyes.\n\n00:11:58.958 --> 00:12:02.958\nIt's one that says, \"Don't do this.\n\n00:12:02.958 --> 00:12:04.958\nAnd I'm not saying this to save myself,\n\n00:12:04.958 --> 00:12:08.958\nalthough this would be nice. I'm doing it to save you,\n\n00:12:08.958 --> 00:12:12.958\nbecause if you do this, you will be lost.\"\n\n00:12:12.958 --> 00:12:15.958\nTo be so afraid that you're standing in the face\n\n00:12:15.958 --> 00:12:17.958\nof a death you can't escape and that you're soiling yourself\n\n00:12:17.958 --> 00:12:19.958\nand crying, but to say in that moment,\n\n00:12:19.958 --> 00:12:23.958\nas Fraser says to Idris, \"Tell my girlfriend I love her.\"\n\n00:12:23.958 --> 00:12:27.958\nIn that moment, Fraser says,\n\n00:12:27.958 --> 00:12:32.958\n\"I am lost already, but not you ... not you.\"\n\n00:12:32.958 --> 00:12:35.958\nThis is a redemption we can all aspire to.\n\n00:12:35.958 --> 00:12:39.958\nAfrican narratives in the West, they proliferate.\n\n00:12:39.958 --> 00:12:40.958\nI really don't care anymore.\n\n00:12:40.958 --> 00:12:44.958\nI'm more interested in the stories we tell about ourselves --\n\n00:12:44.958 --> 00:12:49.958\nhow as a writer, I find that African writers\n\n00:12:49.958 --> 00:12:52.958\nhave always been the curators of our humanity on this continent.\n\n00:12:52.958 --> 00:12:58.958\nThe question is, how do I balance narratives that are wonderful\n\n00:12:58.958 --> 00:13:02.958\nwith narratives of wounds and self-loathing?\n\n00:13:02.958 --> 00:13:05.958\nAnd this is the difficulty that I face.\n\n00:13:05.958 --> 00:13:07.958\nI am trying to move beyond political rhetoric\n\n00:13:07.958 --> 00:13:09.958\nto a place of ethical questioning.\n\n00:13:09.958 --> 00:13:12.958\nI am asking us to balance the idea\n\n00:13:12.958 --> 00:13:16.958\nof our complete vulnerability with the complete notion\n\n00:13:16.958 --> 00:13:18.958\nof transformation of what is possible.\n\n00:13:18.958 --> 00:13:20.958\nAs a young middle-class Nigerian activist,\n\n00:13:20.958 --> 00:13:23.958\nI launched myself along with a whole generation of us\n\n00:13:23.958 --> 00:13:26.958\ninto the campaign to stop the government.\n\n00:13:26.958 --> 00:13:28.958\nAnd I asked millions of people,\n\n00:13:28.958 --> 00:13:30.958\nwithout questioning my right to do so,\n\n00:13:30.958 --> 00:13:32.958\nto go up against the government.\n\n00:13:32.958 --> 00:13:34.958\nAnd I watched them being locked up in prison and tear gassed.\n\n00:13:34.958 --> 00:13:37.958\nI justified it, and I said, \"This is the cost of revolution.\n\n00:13:37.958 --> 00:13:39.958\nHave I not myself been imprisoned?\n\n00:13:39.958 --> 00:13:41.958\nHave I not myself been beaten?\"\n\n00:13:41.958 --> 00:13:44.958\nIt wasn't until later, when I was imprisoned again,\n\n00:13:44.958 --> 00:13:46.958\nthat I understood the real meaning of torture,\n\n00:13:46.958 --> 00:13:49.958\nand how easy your humanity can be taken from you,\n\n00:13:49.958 --> 00:13:52.958\nfor the time I was engaged in war,\n\n00:13:52.958 --> 00:13:55.958\nrighteous, righteous war.\n\n00:13:55.958 --> 00:13:58.958\nExcuse me.\n\n00:13:58.958 --> 00:14:00.958\nSometimes I can stand before the world --\n\n00:14:00.958 --> 00:14:02.958\nand when I say this, transformation\n\n00:14:02.958 --> 00:14:04.958\nis a difficult and slow process --\n\n00:14:04.958 --> 00:14:07.958\nsometimes I can stand before the world and say,\n\n00:14:07.958 --> 00:14:09.958\n\"My name is Chris Abani.\n\n00:14:09.958 --> 00:14:12.958\nI have been human six days, but only sometimes.\"\n\n00:14:12.958 --> 00:14:14.958\nBut this is a good thing.\n\n00:14:14.958 --> 00:14:16.958\nIt's never going to be easy.\n\n00:14:16.958 --> 00:14:18.958\nThere are no answers.\n\n00:14:18.958 --> 00:14:20.958\nAs I was telling Rachel from Google Earth,\n\n00:14:20.958 --> 00:14:22.958\nthat I had challenged my students in America --\n\n00:14:22.958 --> 00:14:25.958\nI said, \"You don't know anything about Africa, you're all idiots.\"\n\n00:14:25.958 --> 00:14:28.958\nAnd so they said, \"Tell me about Africa, Professor Abani.\"\n\n00:14:28.958 --> 00:14:31.958\nSo I went to Google Earth and learned about Africa.\n\n00:14:31.958 --> 00:14:34.958\nAnd the truth be told, this is it, isn't it?\n\n00:14:34.958 --> 00:14:35.958\nThere are no essential Africans,\n\n00:14:35.958 --> 00:14:37.958\nand most of us are as completely ignorant as everyone else\n\n00:14:37.958 --> 00:14:39.958\nabout the continent we come from,\n\n00:14:39.958 --> 00:14:42.958\nand yet we want to make profound statements about it.\n\n00:14:42.958 --> 00:14:44.958\nAnd I think if we can just admit that we're all trying\n\n00:14:44.958 --> 00:14:47.958\nto approximate the truth of our own communities,\n\n00:14:47.958 --> 00:14:49.958\nit will make for a much more nuanced\n\n00:14:49.958 --> 00:14:52.958\nand a much more interesting conversation.\n\n00:14:52.958 --> 00:14:56.958\nI want to believe that we can be agnostic about this,\n\n00:14:56.958 --> 00:14:58.958\nthat we can rise above all of this.\n\n00:14:58.958 --> 00:15:02.958\nWhen I was 10, I read James Baldwin's \"Another Country,\"\n\n00:15:02.958 --> 00:15:04.958\nand that book broke me.\n\n00:15:04.958 --> 00:15:07.958\nNot because I was encountering homosexual sex and love\n\n00:15:07.958 --> 00:15:10.958\nfor the first time, but because the way James wrote about it\n\n00:15:10.958 --> 00:15:13.958\nmade it impossible for me to attach otherness to it.\n\n00:15:13.958 --> 00:15:15.958\n\"Here,\" Jimmy said.\n\n00:15:15.958 --> 00:15:17.958\n\"Here is love, all of it.\"\n\n00:15:17.958 --> 00:15:19.958\nThe fact that it happens in \"Another Country\"\n\n00:15:19.958 --> 00:15:22.958\ntakes you quite by surprise.\n\n00:15:22.958 --> 00:15:24.958\nMy friend Ronald Gottesman says there are three kinds of people in the world:\n\n00:15:24.958 --> 00:15:27.958\nthose who can count, and those who can't.\n\n00:15:27.958 --> 00:15:31.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:15:31.958 --> 00:15:34.958\nHe also says that the cause of all our trouble\n\n00:15:34.958 --> 00:15:37.958\nis the belief in an essential, pure identity:\n\n00:15:37.958 --> 00:15:42.958\nreligious, ethnic, historical, ideological.\n\n00:15:42.958 --> 00:15:45.958\nI want to leave you with a poem by Yusef Komunyakaa\n\n00:15:45.958 --> 00:15:48.958\nthat speaks to transformation.\n\n00:15:48.958 --> 00:15:51.958\nIt's called \"Ode to the Drum,\" and I'll try and read it\n\n00:15:51.958 --> 00:15:54.958\nthe way Yusef would be proud to hear it read.\n\n00:15:57.958 --> 00:16:03.958\n\"Gazelle, I killed you for your skin's exquisite

I heard my daughter praying for the meat here at my feet.\n\n00:16:15.958 --> 00:16:19.958\nYou know it wasn't anger that made me stop my heart till the hammer fell.\n\n00:16:19.958 -->

grassy hush.\n\n00:16:29.958 --> 00:16:34.958\nAnd now I'm tightening lashes, shaped in hide as if around a ribcage,\n\n00:16:34.958 --> 00:16:36.958\nshaped like five bowstrings.\n\n00:16:36.958 -->

My first introduction was at the Abidjan airport on a sweaty, Ivory Coast morning. I had just left Wall Street, cut my hair to look like Margaret Mead, given away most everything that I owned, and arrived with all the essentials \u2014 some poetry, a few clothes, and, of course, a guitar \u2014 because I was going to save the world, and I thought I would just start with the African continent.But literally within days of arriving I was told, in no uncertain terms, by a number of West African women, that Africans didn't want saving, thank you very much, least of all not by me. I was too young, unmarried, I had no children, didn't really know Africa, and besides, my French was pitiful. And so, it was an incredibly painful time in my life, and yet it really started to give me the humility to start listening.I think that failure can be an incredibly motivating force as well, so I moved to Kenya and worked in Uganda, and I met a group of Rwandan women, who asked me, in 1986, to move to Kigali to help them start the first microfinance institution there. And I did, and we ended up naming it Duterimbere, meaning \"to go forward with enthusiasm.\" And while we were doing it, I realized that there weren't a lot of businesses that were viable and started by women, and so maybe I should try to run a business, too. And so I started looking around, and I heard about a bakery that was run by 20 prostitutes. And, being a little intrigued, I went to go meet this group, and what I found was 20 unwed mothers who were trying to survive.And it was really the beginning of my understanding the power of language, and how what we call people so often distances us from them, and makes them little. I also found out that the bakery was nothing like a business, that, in fact, it was a classic charity run by a well-intentioned person, who essentially spent 600 dollars a month to keep these 20 women busy making little crafts and baked goods, and living on 50 cents a day, still in poverty. So, I made a deal with the women. I said, \"Look, we get rid of the charity side, and we run this as a business and I'll help you.\" They nervously agreed. I nervously started, and, of course, things are always harder than you think they're going to be.First of all, I thought, well, we need a sales team, and we clearly aren't the A-Team here, so let's \u2014 I did all this training. And the epitome was when I literally marched into the streets of Nyamirambo, which is the popular quarter of Kigali, with a bucket, and I sold all these little doughnuts to people, and I came back, and I was like, \"You see?\" And the women said, \"You know, Jacqueline, who in Nyamirambo is not going to buy doughnuts out of an orange bucket from a tall American woman?\" And like \u2014 (Laughter) \u2014 it's a good point.So then I went the whole American way, with competitions, team and individual. Completely failed, but over time, the women learnt to sell on their own way. And they started listening to the marketplace, and they came back with ideas for cassava chips, and banana chips, and sorghum bread, and before you knew it, we had cornered the Kigali market, and the women were earning three to four times the national average. And with that confidence surge, I thought, \"Well, it's time to create a real bakery, so let's paint it.\" And the women said, \"That's a really great idea.\" And I said, \"Well, what color do you want to paint it?\" And they said, \"Well, you choose.\" And I said, \"No, no, I'm learning to listen. You choose. It's your bakery, your street, your country \u2014 not mine.\" But they wouldn't give me an answer. So, one week, two weeks, three weeks went by, and finally I said, \"Well, how about blue?\" And they said, \"Blue, blue, we love blue. Let's do it blue.\" So, I went to the store, I brought Gaudence, the recalcitrant one of all, and we brought all this paint and fabric to make curtains, and on painting day, we all gathered in Nyamirambo, and the idea was we would paint it white with blue as trim, like a little French bakery. But that was clearly not as satisfying as painting a wall of blue like a morning sky.So, blue, blue, everything became blue. The walls were blue, the windows were blue, the sidewalk out front was painted blue. And Aretha Franklin was shouting \"R-E-S-P-E-C-T,\" the women's hips were swaying and little kids were trying to grab the paintbrushes, but it was their day. And at the end of it, we stood across the street and we looked at what we had done, and I said, \"It is so beautiful.\" And the women said, \"It really is.\" And I said, \"And I think the color is perfect,\" and they all nodded their head, except for Gaudence, and I said, \"What?\" And she said, \"Nothing.\" And I said, \"What?\" And she said, \"Well, it is pretty, but, you know, our color, really, it is green.\" And \u2014 (Laughter)\u2014 I learned then that listening isn't just about patience, but that when you've lived on charity and dependent your whole life long, it's really hard to say what you mean. And, mostly because people never really ask you, and when they do, you don't really think they want to know the truth. And so then I learned that listening is not only about waiting, but it's also learning how better to ask questions.And so, I lived in Kigali for about two and a half years, doing these two things, and it was an extraordinary time in my life. And it taught me three lessons that I think are so important for us today, and certainly in the work that I do. The first is that dignity is more important to the human spirit than wealth. As Eleni has said, when people gain income, they gain choice, and that is fundamental to dignity. But as human beings, we also want to see each other, and we want to be heard by each other, and we should never forget that. The second is that traditional charity and aid are never going to solve the problems of poverty.I think Andrew pretty well covered that, so I will move to the third point, which is that markets alone also are not going to solve the problems of poverty. Yes, we ran this as a business, but someone needed to pay the philanthropic support that came into the training, and the management support, the strategic advice and, maybe most important of all, the access to new contacts, networks and new markets. And so, on a micro level, there's a real role for this combination of investment and philanthropy. And on a macro level \u2014 some of the speakers have inferred that even health should be privatized. But, having had a father with heart disease, and realizing that what our family could afford was not what he should have gotten, and having a good friend step in to help, I really believe that all people deserve access to health at prices they can afford. I think the market can help us figure that out, but there's got to be a charitable component, or I don't think we're going to create the kind of societies we want to live in.And so, it was really those lessons that made me decide to build Acumen Fund about six years ago. It's a nonprofit, venture capital fund for the poor, a few oxymorons in one sentence. It essentially raises charitable funds from individuals, foundations and corporations, and then we turn around and we invest equity and loans in both for-profit and nonprofit entities that deliver affordable health, housing, energy, clean water to low income people in South Asia and Africa, so that they can make their own choices. We've invested about 20 million dollars in 20 different enterprises, and have, in so doing, created nearly 20,000 jobs, and delivered tens of millions of services to people who otherwise would not be able to afford them.I want to tell you two stories. Both of them are in Africa. Both of them are about investing in entrepreneurs who are committed to service, and who really know the markets. Both of them live at the confluence of public health and enterprise, and both of them, because they're manufacturers, create jobs directly, and create incomes indirectly, because they're in the malaria sector, and Africa loses about 13 billion dollars a year because of malaria. And so as people get healthier, they also get wealthier.The first one is called Advanced Bio-Extracts Limited. It's a company built in Kenya about seven years ago by an incredible entrepreneur named Patrick Henfrey and his three colleagues. These are old-hand farmers who've gone through all the agricultural ups and downs in Kenya over the last 30 years. Now, this plant is an Artemisia plant; it's the basic component for artemisinin, which is the best-known treatment for malaria. It's indigenous to China and the Far East, but given that the prevalence of malaria is here in Africa, Patrick and his colleagues said, \"Let's bring it here, because it's a high value-add product.\" The farmers get three to four times the yields that they would with maize.And so, using patient capital \u2014 money that they could raise early on, that actually got below market returns and was willing to go the long haul and be combined with management assistance, strategic assistance \u2014 they've now created a company where they purchase from 7,500 farmers. So that's about 50,000 people affected. And I think some of you may have visited \u2014 these farmers are helped by KickStart and TechnoServe, who help them become more self-sufficient. They buy it, they dry it and they bring it to this factory, which was purchased in part by, again, patient capital from Novartis, who has a real interest in getting the powder so that they can make Coartem. Acumen's been working with ABE for the past year, year and a half, both on looking at a new business plan, and what does expansion look like, helping with management support and helping to do term sheets and raise capital. And I really understood what patient capital meant emotionally in the last month or so. Because the company was literally 10 days away from proving that the product they produced was at the world-quality level needed to make Coartem, when they were in the biggest cash crisis of their history.And we called all of the social investors we know. Now, some of these same social investors are really interested in Africa and understand the importance of agriculture, and they even helped the farmers. And even when we explained that if ABE goes away, all those 7,500 jobs go away too, we sometimes have this bifurcation between business and the social. And it's really time we start thinking more creatively about how they can be fused. So Acumen made not one, but two bridge loans, and the good news is they did indeed meet world-quality classification and are now in the final stages of closing a 20-million-dollar round, to move it to the next level, and I think that this will be one of the more important companies in East Africa.This is Samuel. He's a farmer. He was actually living in the Kibera slums when his father called him and told him about Artemisia and the value-add potential. So he moved back to the farm, and, long story short, they now have seven acres under cultivation. Samuel's kids are in private school, and he's starting to help other farmers in the area also go into Artemisia production \u2014 dignity being more important than wealth.The next one, many of you know. I talked about it a little at Oxford two years ago, and some of you visited A to Z manufacturing, which is one of the great, real companies in East Africa. It's another one that lives at the confluence of health and enterprise. And this is really a story about a public-private solution that has really worked. It started in Japan. Sumitomo had developed a technology essentially to impregnate a polyethylene-based fiber with organic insecticide, so you could create a bed net, a malaria bed net, that would last five years and not need to be re-dipped.It could alter the vector, but like Artemisia, it had been produced only in East Asia. And as part of its social responsibility, Sumitomo said, \"Why don't we experiment with whether we can produce it in Africa, for Africans?\" UNICEF came forward and said, \"We'll buy most of the nets, and then we'll give them away, as part of the global fund's and the U.N.'s commitment to pregnant women and children, for free.\" Acumen came in with the patient capital, and we also helped to identify the entrepreneur that we would all partner with here in Africa, and Exxon provided the initial resin.Well, in looking around for entrepreneurs, there was none better that we could find on earth than Anuj Shah, in A to Z manufacturing company. It's a 40-year-old company, it understands manufacturing. It's gone from socialist Tanzania into capitalist Tanzania, and continued to flourish. It had about 1,000 employees when we first found it. And so, Anuj took the entrepreneurial risk here in Africa to produce a public good that was purchased by the aid establishment to work with malaria.And, long story short, again, they've been so successful. In our first year, the first net went off the line in October of 2003. We thought the hitting-it-out-of-the-box number was 150,000 nets a year. This year, they are now producing eight million nets a year, and they employ 5,000 people, 90 percent of whom are women, mostly unskilled. They're in a joint venture with Sumitomo. And so, from an enterprise perspective for Africa, and from a public health perspective, these are real successes.But it's only half the story if we're really looking at solving problems of poverty, because it's not long-term sustainable. It's a company with one big customer. And if avian flu hits, or for any other reason the world decides that malaria is no longer as much of a priority, everybody loses. And so, Anuj and Acumen have been talking about testing the private sector, because the assumption that the aid establishment has made is that, look, in a country like Tanzania, 80 percent of the population makes less than two dollars a day. It costs, at manufacturing point, six dollars to produce these, and it costs the establishment another six dollars to distribute it, so the market price in a free market would be about 12 dollars per net. Most people can't afford that, so let's give it away free. And we said, \"Well, there's another option. Let's use the market as the best listening device we have, and understand at what price people would pay for this, so they get the dignity of choice. We can start building local distribution, and actually, it can cost the public sector much less.\"And so we came in with a second round of patient capital to A to Z, a loan as well as a grant, so that A to Z could play with pricing and listen to the marketplace, and found a number of things. One, that people will pay different prices, but the overwhelming number of people will come forth at one dollar per net and make a decision to buy it. And when you listen to them, they'll also have a lot to say about what they like and what they don't like. And that some of the channels we thought would work didn't work. But because of this experimentation and iteration that was allowed because of the patient capital, we've now found that it costs about a dollar in the private sector to distribute, and a dollar to buy the net. So then, from a policy perspective, when you start with the market, we have a choice. We can continue going along at 12 dollars a net, and the customer pays zero, or we could at least experiment with some of it, to charge one dollar a net, costing the public sector another six dollars a net, give the people the dignity of choice, and have a distribution system that might, over time, start sustaining itself.We've got to start having conversations like this, and I don't think there's any better way to start than using the market, but also to bring other people to the table around it. Whenever I go to visit A to Z, I think of my grandmother, Stella. She was very much like those women sitting behind the sewing machines. She grew up on a farm in Austria, very poor, didn't have very much education. She moved to the United States, where she met my grandfather, who was a cement hauler, and they had nine children. Three of them died as babies. My grandmother had tuberculosis, and she worked in a sewing machine shop, making shirts for about 10 cents an hour. She, like so many of the women I see at A to Z, worked hard every day, understood what suffering was, had a deep faith in God, loved her children and would never have accepted a handout. But because she had the opportunity of the marketplace, and she lived in a society that provided the safety of having access to affordable health and education, her children and their children were able to live lives of real purpose and follow real dreams.I look around at my siblings and my cousins \u2014 and as I said, there are a lot of us \u2014 and I see teachers and musicians, hedge fund managers, designers. One sister who makes other people's wishes come true. And my wish, when I see those women, I meet those farmers, and I think about all the people across this continent who are working hard every day, is that they have that sense of opportunity and possibility, and that they also can believe and get access to services, so that their children, too, can live those lives of great purpose. It shouldn't be that difficult. But what it takes is a commitment from all of us to essentially refuse trite assumptions, get out of our ideological boxes. It takes investing in those entrepreneurs that are committed to service as well as to success. It takes opening your arms, both, wide, and expecting very little love in return, but demanding accountability, and bringing the accountability to the table as well. And most of all, most of all, it requires that all of us have the courage and the patience, whether we are rich or poor, African or non-African, local or diaspora, left or right, to really start listening to each other. Thank you.

I said, \"Look, we get rid of the charity side,\n\n00:02:21.958 --> 00:02:24.958\nand we run this as a business and I'll help you.\"\n\n00:02:24.958 --> 00:02:28.958\nThey nervously agreed. I nervously started, and, of course,\n\n00:02:28.958 --> 00:02:30.958\nthings are always harder than you think they're going to be.\n\n00:02:30.958 --> 00:02:32.958\nFirst of all, I thought, well, we need a sales team,\n\n00:02:32.958 --> 00:02:34.958\nand we clearly aren't the A-Team here,\n\n00:02:34.958 --> 00:02:37.958\nso let's -- I did all this training.\n\n00:02:37.958 --> 00:02:41.958\nAnd the epitome was when I literally marched into the streets\n\n00:02:41.958 --> 00:02:44.958\nof Nyamirambo, which is the popular quarter of Kigali, with a bucket,\n\n00:02:44.958 --> 00:02:47.958\nand I sold all these little doughnuts to people,\n\n00:02:47.958 --> 00:02:49.958\nand I came back, and I was like, \"You see?\"\n\n00:02:49.958 --> 00:02:53.958\nAnd the women said, \"You know, Jacqueline, who in Nyamirambo is not going to buy\n\n00:02:53.958 --> 00:02:57.958\ndoughnuts out of an orange bucket from a tall American woman?\" And like --\n\n00:02:57.958 --> 00:02:59.958\n(Laughter) -- it's a good point.\n\n00:02:59.958 --> 00:03:01.958\nSo then I went the whole American way,\n\n00:03:01.958 --> 00:03:04.958\nwith competitions, team and individual. Completely failed,\n\n00:03:04.958 --> 00:03:08.958\nbut over time, the women learnt to sell on their own way.\n\n00:03:08.958 --> 00:03:10.958\nAnd they started listening to the marketplace,\n\n00:03:10.958 --> 00:03:13.958\nand they came back with ideas for cassava chips, and banana chips,\n\n00:03:13.958 --> 00:03:15.958\nand sorghum bread, and before you knew it,\n\n00:03:15.958 --> 00:03:17.958\nwe had cornered the Kigali market,\n\n00:03:17.958 --> 00:03:20.958\nand the women were earning three to four times the national average.\n\n00:03:20.958 --> 00:03:24.958\nAnd with that confidence surge, I thought, \"Well, it's time to create a real bakery,\n\n00:03:24.958 --> 00:03:28.958\nso let's paint it.\" And the women said, \"That's a really great idea.\"\n\n00:03:28.958 --> 00:03:30.958\nAnd I said, \"Well, what color do you want to paint it?\" And they said,\n\n00:03:30.958 --> 00:03:33.958\n\"Well, you choose.\" And I said, \"No, no, I'm learning to listen.\n\n00:03:33.958 --> 00:03:36.958\nYou choose. It's your bakery, your street, your country -- not mine.\"\n\n00:03:36.958 --> 00:03:38.958\nBut they wouldn't give me an answer.\n\n00:03:38.958 --> 00:03:40.958\nSo, one week, two weeks, three weeks went by,\n\n00:03:40.958 --> 00:03:43.958\nand finally I said, \"Well, how about blue?\"\n\n00:03:43.958 --> 00:03:45.958\nAnd they said, \"Blue, blue, we love blue. Let's do it blue.\"\n\n00:03:45.958 --> 00:03:49.958\nSo, I went to the store, I brought Gaudence, the recalcitrant one of all,\n\n00:03:49.958 --> 00:03:53.958\nand we brought all this paint and fabric to make curtains,\n\n00:03:53.958 --> 00:03:56.958\nand on painting day, we all gathered in Nyamirambo,\n\n00:03:56.958 --> 00:03:59.958\nand the idea was we would paint it white with blue as trim,\n\n00:03:59.958 --> 00:04:02.958\nlike a little French bakery. But that was clearly not as satisfying\n\n00:04:02.958 --> 00:04:05.958\nas painting a wall of blue like a morning sky.\n\n00:04:05.958 --> 00:04:08.958\nSo, blue, blue, everything became blue.\n\n00:04:08.958 --> 00:04:09.958\nThe walls were blue, the windows were blue,\n\n00:04:09.958 --> 00:04:12.958\nthe sidewalk out front was painted blue.\n\n00:04:12.958 --> 00:04:16.958\nAnd Aretha Franklin was shouting \"R-E-S-P-E-C-T,\"\n\n00:04:16.958 --> 00:04:18.958\nthe women's hips were swaying\n\n00:04:18.958 --> 00:04:21.958\nand little kids were trying to grab the paintbrushes, but it was their day.\n\n00:04:21.958 --> 00:04:24.958\nAnd at the end of it, we stood across the street\n\n00:04:24.958 --> 00:04:27.958\nand we looked at what we had done, and I said, \"It is so beautiful.\"\n\n00:04:27.958 --> 00:04:29.958\nAnd the women said, \"It really is.\"\n\n00:04:29.958 --> 00:04:32.958\nAnd I said, \"And I think the color is perfect,\"\n\n00:04:32.958 --> 00:04:34.958\nand they all nodded their head, except for Gaudence,\n\n00:04:34.958 --> 00:04:36.958\nand I said, \"What?\"\n\n00:04:36.958 --> 00:04:38.958\nAnd she said, \"Nothing.\" And I said, \"What?\"\n\n00:04:38.958 --> 00:04:44.958\nAnd she said, \"Well, it is pretty, but, you know, our color, really, it is green.\" And --\n\n00:04:44.958 --> 00:04:47.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:04:47.958 --> 00:04:52.958\n-- I learned then that listening isn't just about patience,\n\n00:04:52.958 --> 00:04:57.958\nbut that when you've lived on charity and dependent your whole life long,\n\n00:04:57.958 --> 00:04:59.958\nit's really hard to say what you mean.\n\n00:04:59.958 --> 00:05:03.958\nAnd, mostly because people never really ask you,\n\n00:05:03.958 --> 00:05:06.958\nand when they do, you don't really think they want to know the truth.\n\n00:05:06.958 --> 00:05:09.958\nAnd so then I learned that listening is not only about waiting,\n\n00:05:09.958 --> 00:05:13.958\nbut it's also learning how better to ask questions.\n\n00:05:13.958 --> 00:05:17.958\nAnd so, I lived in Kigali for about two and a half years, doing these two things,\n\n00:05:17.958 --> 00:05:19.958\nand it was an extraordinary time in my life.\n\n00:05:19.958 --> 00:05:21.958\nAnd it taught me three lessons\n\n00:05:21.958 --> 00:05:24.958\nthat I think are so important for us today,\n\n00:05:24.958 --> 00:05:26.958\nand certainly in the work that I do.\n\n00:05:26.958 --> 00:05:30.958\nThe first is that dignity is more important to the human spirit than wealth.\n\n00:05:30.958 --> 00:05:34.958\nAs Eleni has said, when people gain income, they gain choice,\n\n00:05:34.958 --> 00:05:36.958\nand that is fundamental to dignity.\n\n00:05:36.958 --> 00:05:39.958\nBut as human beings, we also want to see each other,\n\n00:05:39.958 --> 00:05:43.958\nand we want to be heard by each other, and we should never forget that.\n\n00:05:43.958 --> 00:05:46.958\nThe second is that traditional charity and aid\n\n00:05:46.958 --> 00:05:48.958\nare never going to solve the problems of poverty.\n\n00:05:48.958 --> 00:05:51.958\nI think Andrew pretty well covered that, so I will move to the third point,\n\n00:05:51.958 --> 00:05:53.958\nwhich is that markets alone also\n\n00:05:53.958 --> 00:05:56.958\nare not going to solve the problems of poverty.\n\n00:05:56.958 --> 00:05:58.958\nYes, we ran this as a business,\n\n00:05:58.958 --> 00:06:03.958\nbut someone needed to pay the philanthropic support\n\n00:06:03.958 --> 00:06:06.958\nthat came into the training, and the management support, the strategic advice\n\n00:06:06.958 --> 00:06:09.958\nand, maybe most important of all,\n\n00:06:09.958 --> 00:06:13.958\nthe access to new contacts, networks and new markets.\n\n00:06:13.958 --> 00:06:17.958\nAnd so, on a micro level, there's a real role for this combination\n\n00:06:17.958 --> 00:06:20.958\nof investment and philanthropy.\n\n00:06:20.958 --> 00:06:24.958\nAnd on a macro level -- some of the speakers have inferred that\n\n00:06:24.958 --> 00:06:26.958\neven health should be privatized.\n\n00:06:26.958 --> 00:06:28.958\nBut, having had a father with heart disease,\n\n00:06:28.958 --> 00:06:32.958\nand realizing that what our family could afford\n\n00:06:32.958 --> 00:06:35.958\nwas not what he should have gotten,\n\n00:06:35.958 --> 00:06:38.958\nand having a good friend step in to help,\n\n00:06:38.958 --> 00:06:41.958\nI really believe that all people deserve access to health\n\n00:06:41.958 --> 00:06:43.958\nat prices they can afford.\n\n00:06:43.958 --> 00:06:45.958\nI think the market can help us figure that out,\n\n00:06:45.958 --> 00:06:47.958\nbut there's got to be a charitable component,\n\n00:06:47.958 --> 00:06:51.958\nor I don't think we're going to create the kind of societies we want to live in.\n\n00:06:51.958 --> 00:06:54.958\nAnd so, it was really those lessons that made me decide to\n\n00:06:54.958 --> 00:06:57.958\nbuild Acumen Fund about six years ago.\n\n00:06:57.958 --> 00:07:00.958\nIt's a nonprofit, venture capital fund for the poor,\n\n00:07:00.958 --> 00:07:02.958\na few oxymorons in one sentence.\n\n00:07:02.958 --> 00:07:07.958\nIt essentially raises charitable funds from individuals, foundations and corporations,\n\n00:07:07.958 --> 00:07:09.958\nand then we turn around and we invest equity and loans\n\n00:07:09.958 --> 00:07:11.958\nin both for-profit and nonprofit entities\n\n00:07:11.958 --> 00:07:15.958\nthat deliver affordable health, housing, energy, clean water\n\n00:07:15.958 --> 00:07:18.958\nto low income people in South Asia and Africa,\n\n00:07:18.958 --> 00:07:20.958\nso that they can make their own choices.\n\n00:07:20.958 --> 00:07:24.958\nWe've invested about 20 million dollars in 20 different enterprises,\n\n00:07:24.958 --> 00:07:29.958\nand have, in so doing, created nearly 20,000 jobs,\n\n00:07:29.958 --> 00:07:31.958\nand delivered tens of millions of services to people\n\n00:07:31.958 --> 00:07:35.958\nwho otherwise would not be able to afford them.\n\n00:07:35.958 --> 00:07:38.958\nI want to tell you two stories. Both of them are in Africa.\n\n00:07:38.958 --> 00:07:40.958\nBoth of them are about investing in entrepreneurs\n\n00:07:40.958 --> 00:07:44.958\nwho are committed to service, and who really know the markets.\n\n00:07:44.958 --> 00:07:48.958\nBoth of them live at the confluence of public health and enterprise,\n\n00:07:48.958 --> 00:07:50.958\nand both of them, because they're manufacturers,\n\n00:07:50.958 --> 00:07:53.958\ncreate jobs directly, and create incomes indirectly,\n\n00:07:53.958 --> 00:07:55.958\nbecause they're in the malaria sector,\n\n00:07:55.958 --> 00:08:00.958\nand Africa loses about 13 billion dollars a year because of malaria.\n\n00:08:00.958 --> 00:08:04.958\nAnd so as people get healthier, they also get wealthier.\n\n00:08:04.958 --> 00:08:07.958\nThe first one is called Advanced Bio-Extracts Limited.\n\n00:08:07.958 --> 00:08:09.958\nIt's a company built in Kenya about seven years ago\n\n00:08:09.958 --> 00:08:13.958\nby an incredible entrepreneur named Patrick Henfrey and his three colleagues.\n\n00:08:13.958 --> 00:08:15.958\nThese are old-hand farmers\n\n00:08:15.958 --> 00:08:17.958\nwho've gone through all the agricultural ups and downs\n\n00:08:17.958 --> 00:08:19.958\nin Kenya over the last 30 years.\n\n00:08:19.958 --> 00:08:22.958\nNow, this plant is an Artemisia plant;\n\n00:08:22.958 --> 00:08:24.958\nit's the basic component for artemisinin,\n\n00:08:24.958 --> 00:08:26.958\nwhich is the best-known treatment for malaria.\n\n00:08:26.958 --> 00:08:30.958\nIt's indigenous to China and the Far East,\n\n00:08:30.958 --> 00:08:32.958\nbut given that the prevalence of malaria is here in Africa,\n\n00:08:32.958 --> 00:08:36.958\nPatrick and his colleagues said, \"Let's bring it here,\n\n00:08:36.958 --> 00:08:38.958\nbecause it's a high value-add product.\"\n\n00:08:38.958 --> 00:08:44.958\nThe farmers get three to four times the yields that they would with maize.\n\n00:08:44.958 --> 00:08:48.958\nAnd so, using patient capital -- money that they could raise early on,\n\n00:08:48.958 --> 00:08:50.958\nthat actually got below market returns\n\n00:08:50.958 --> 00:08:54.958\nand was willing to go the long haul and be combined\n\n00:08:54.958 --> 00:08:57.958\nwith management assistance, strategic assistance --\n\n00:08:57.958 --> 00:09:01.958\nthey've now created a company where they purchase from 7,500 farmers.\n\n00:09:01.958 --> 00:09:03.958\nSo that's about 50,000 people affected.\n\n00:09:03.958 --> 00:09:05.958\nAnd I think some of you may have visited --\n\n00:09:05.958 --> 00:09:08.958\nthese farmers are helped by KickStart and TechnoServe,\n\n00:09:08.958 --> 00:09:10.958\nwho help them become more self-sufficient.\n\n00:09:10.958 --> 00:09:13.958\nThey buy it, they dry it and they bring it to this factory,\n\n00:09:13.958 --> 00:09:17.958\nwhich was purchased in part by, again, patient capital from Novartis,\n\n00:09:17.958 --> 00:09:20.958\nwho has a real interest in getting the powder\n\n00:09:20.958 --> 00:09:23.958\nso that they can make Coartem.\n\n00:09:23.958 --> 00:09:28.958\nAcumen's been working with ABE for the past year, year and a half,\n\n00:09:28.958 --> 00:09:30.958\nboth on looking at a new business plan,\n\n00:09:30.958 --> 00:09:33.958\nand what does expansion look like, helping with management support\n\n00:09:33.958 --> 00:09:37.958\nand helping to do term sheets and raise capital.\n\n00:09:37.958 --> 00:09:40.958\nAnd I really understood what patient capital meant emotionally\n\n00:09:40.958 --> 00:09:44.958\nin the last month or so. Because the company was literally\n\n00:09:44.958 --> 00:09:48.958\n10 days away from proving that the product they produced\n\n00:09:48.958 --> 00:09:52.958\nwas at the world-quality level needed to make Coartem,\n\n00:09:52.958 --> 00:09:55.958\nwhen they were in the biggest cash crisis of their history.\n\n00:09:55.958 --> 00:09:58.958\nAnd we called all of the social investors we know.\n\n00:09:58.958 --> 00:10:02.958\nNow, some of these same social investors are really interested in Africa\n\n00:10:02.958 --> 00:10:04.958\nand understand the importance of agriculture,\n\n00:10:04.958 --> 00:10:07.958\nand they even helped the farmers.\n\n00:10:07.958 --> 00:10:10.958\nAnd even when we explained that if ABE goes away,\n\n00:10:10.958 --> 00:10:14.958\nall those 7,500 jobs go away too,\n\n00:10:14.958 --> 00:10:19.958\nwe sometimes have this bifurcation between business and the social.\n\n00:10:19.958 --> 00:10:23.958\nAnd it's really time we start thinking more creatively about how they can be fused.\n\n00:10:23.958 --> 00:10:26.958\nSo Acumen made not one, but two bridge loans,\n\n00:10:26.958 --> 00:10:32.958\nand the good news is they did indeed meet world-quality classification and are now\n\n00:10:32.958 --> 00:10:36.958\nin the final stages of closing a 20-million-dollar round, to move it to the next level,\n\n00:10:36.958 --> 00:10:42.958\nand I think that this will be one of the more important companies in East Africa.\n\n00:10:42.958 --> 00:10:44.958\nThis is Samuel. He's a farmer.\n\n00:10:44.958 --> 00:10:46.958\nHe was actually living in the Kibera slums\n\n00:10:46.958 --> 00:10:51.958\nwhen his father called him and told him about Artemisia and the value-add potential.\n\n00:10:51.958 --> 00:10:54.958\nSo he moved back to the farm, and, long story short,\n\n00:10:54.958 --> 00:10:57.958\nthey now have seven acres under cultivation.\n\n00:10:57.958 --> 00:10:59.958\nSamuel's kids are in private school,\n\n00:10:59.958 --> 00:11:05.958\nand he's starting to help other farmers in the area also go into Artemisia production --\n\n00:11:05.958 --> 00:11:08.958\ndignity being more important than wealth.\n\n00:11:08.958 --> 00:11:11.958\nThe next one, many of you know.\n\n00:11:11.958 --> 00:11:14.958\nI talked about it a little at Oxford two years ago,\n\n00:11:14.958 --> 00:11:16.958\nand some of you visited A to Z manufacturing,\n\n00:11:16.958 --> 00:11:20.958\nwhich is one of the great, real companies in East Africa.\n\n00:11:20.958 --> 00:11:25.958\nIt's another one that lives at the confluence of health and enterprise.\n\n00:11:25.958 --> 00:11:29.958\nAnd this is really a story about a public-private solution\n\n00:11:29.958 --> 00:11:31.958\nthat has really worked.\n\n00:11:31.958 --> 00:11:35.958\nIt started in Japan. Sumitomo had developed a technology\n\n00:11:35.958 --> 00:11:39.958\nessentially to impregnate a polyethylene-based fiber with organic insecticide,\n\n00:11:39.958 --> 00:11:41.958\nso you could create a bed net,\n\n00:11:41.958 --> 00:11:44.958\na malaria bed net, that would last five years and not need to be re-dipped.\n\n00:11:44.958 --> 00:11:47.958\nIt could alter the vector, but like Artemisia,\n\n00:11:47.958 --> 00:11:51.958\nit had been produced only in East Asia. And as part of its social responsibility,\n\n00:11:51.958 --> 00:11:53.958\nSumitomo said, \"Why don't we experiment\n\n00:11:53.958 --> 00:11:56.958\nwith whether we can produce it in Africa, for Africans?\"\n\n00:11:56.958 --> 00:11:59.958\nUNICEF came forward and said, \"We'll buy most of the nets,\n\n00:11:59.958 --> 00:12:02.958\nand then we'll give them away, as part of the global fund's\n\n00:12:02.958 --> 00:12:08.958\nand the U.N.'s commitment to pregnant women and children, for free.\"\n\n00:12:08.958 --> 00:12:11.958\nAcumen came in with the patient capital,\n\n00:12:11.958 --> 00:12:13.958\nand we also helped to identify the entrepreneur\n\n00:12:13.958 --> 00:12:16.958\nthat we would all partner with here in Africa,\n\n00:12:16.958 --> 00:12:19.958\nand Exxon provided the initial resin.\n\n00:12:19.958 --> 00:12:21.958\nWell, in looking around for entrepreneurs,\n\n00:12:21.958 --> 00:12:24.958\nthere was none better that we could find on earth than Anuj Shah,\n\n00:12:24.958 --> 00:12:26.958\nin A to Z manufacturing company.\n\n00:12:26.958 --> 00:12:29.958\nIt's a 40-year-old company, it understands manufacturing.\n\n00:12:29.958 --> 00:12:32.958\nIt's gone from socialist Tanzania into capitalist Tanzania,\n\n00:12:32.958 --> 00:12:37.958\nand continued to flourish. It had about 1,000 employees when we first found it.\n\n00:12:37.958 --> 00:12:40.958\nAnd so, Anuj took the entrepreneurial risk here in Africa\n\n00:12:40.958 --> 00:12:45.958\nto produce a public good that was purchased by the aid establishment\n\n00:12:45.958 --> 00:12:48.958\nto work with malaria.\n\n00:12:48.958 --> 00:12:51.958\nAnd, long story short, again, they've been so successful.\n\n00:12:51.958 --> 00:12:56.958\nIn our first year, the first net went off the line in October of 2003.\n\n00:12:56.958 --> 00:13:01.958\nWe thought the hitting-it-out-of-the-box number was 150,000 nets a year.\n\n00:13:01.958 --> 00:13:04.958\nThis year, they are now producing eight million nets a year,\n\n00:13:04.958 --> 00:13:09.958\nand they employ 5,000 people, 90 percent of whom are women, mostly unskilled.\n\n00:13:09.958 --> 00:13:12.958\nThey're in a joint venture with Sumitomo.\n\n00:13:12.958 --> 00:13:15.958\nAnd so, from an enterprise perspective for Africa,\n\n00:13:15.958 --> 00:13:18.958\nand from a public health perspective, these are real successes.\n\n00:13:18.958 --> 00:13:22.958\nBut it's only half the story if we're really looking at solving problems of poverty,\n\n00:13:22.958 --> 00:13:24.958\nbecause it's not long-term sustainable.\n\n00:13:24.958 --> 00:13:26.958\nIt's a company with one big customer.\n\n00:13:26.958 --> 00:13:30.958\nAnd if avian flu hits, or for any other reason\n\n00:13:30.958 --> 00:13:35.958\nthe world decides that malaria is no longer as much of a priority, everybody loses.\n\n00:13:35.958 --> 00:13:38.958\nAnd so, Anuj and Acumen\n\n00:13:38.958 --> 00:13:41.958\nhave been talking about testing the private sector,\n\n00:13:41.958 --> 00:13:46.958\nbecause the assumption that the aid establishment has made is that,\n\n00:13:46.958 --> 00:13:48.958\nlook, in a country like Tanzania,\n\n00:13:48.958 --> 00:13:50.958\n80 percent of the population makes less than two dollars a day.\n\n00:13:50.958 --> 00:13:54.958\nIt costs, at manufacturing point, six dollars to produce these,\n\n00:13:54.958 --> 00:13:59.958\nand it costs the establishment another six dollars to distribute it,\n\n00:13:59.958 --> 00:14:03.958\nso the market price in a free market would be about 12 dollars per net.\n\n00:14:03.958 --> 00:14:05.958\nMost people can't afford that, so let's give it away free.\n\n00:14:05.958 --> 00:14:08.958\nAnd we said, \"Well, there's another option.\n\n00:14:08.958 --> 00:14:11.958\nLet's use the market as the best listening device we have, and\n\n00:14:11.958 --> 00:14:16.958\nunderstand at what price people would pay for this, so they get the dignity of choice.\n\n00:14:16.958 --> 00:14:18.958\nWe can start building local distribution,\n\n00:14:18.958 --> 00:14:22.958\nand actually, it can cost the public sector much less.\"\n\n00:14:22.958 --> 00:14:26.958\nAnd so we came in with a second round of patient capital to A to Z,\n\n00:14:26.958 --> 00:14:30.958\na loan as well as a grant, so that A to Z could play with pricing\n\n00:14:30.958 --> 00:14:33.958\nand listen to the marketplace, and found a number of things.\n\n00:14:33.958 --> 00:14:35.958\nOne, that people will pay different prices,\n\n00:14:35.958 --> 00:14:39.958\nbut the overwhelming number of people will come forth at one dollar per net\n\n00:14:39.958 --> 00:14:41.958\nand make a decision to buy it.\n\n00:14:41.958 --> 00:14:44.958\nAnd when you listen to them, they'll also have a lot to say\n\n00:14:44.958 --> 00:14:46.958\nabout what they like and what they don't like.\n\n00:14:46.958 --> 00:14:50.958\nAnd that some of the channels we thought would work didn't work.\n\n00:14:50.958 --> 00:14:53.958\nBut because of this experimentation and iteration that was allowed\n\n00:14:53.958 --> 00:14:55.958\nbecause of the patient capital,\n\n00:14:55.958 --> 00:14:58.958\nwe've now found that it costs about a dollar in the private sector\n\n00:14:58.958 --> 00:15:00.958\nto distribute, and a dollar to buy the net.\n\n00:15:00.958 --> 00:15:04.958\nSo then, from a policy perspective, when you start with the market,\n\n00:15:04.958 --> 00:15:05.958\nwe have a choice.\n\n00:15:05.958 --> 00:15:11.958\nWe can continue going along at 12 dollars a net, and the customer pays zero,\n\n00:15:11.958 --> 00:15:17.958\nor we could at least experiment with some of it, to charge one dollar a net,\n\n00:15:17.958 --> 00:15:20.958\ncosting the public sector another six dollars a net,\n\n00:15:20.958 --> 00:15:24.958\ngive the people the dignity of choice, and have a distribution system\n\n00:15:24.958 --> 00:15:27.958\nthat might, over time, start sustaining itself.\n\n00:15:27.958 --> 00:15:29.958\nWe've got to start having conversations like this,\n\n00:15:29.958 --> 00:15:33.958\nand I don't think there's any better way to start than using the market,\n\n00:15:33.958 --> 00:15:37.958\nbut also to bring other people to the table around it.\n\n00:15:37.958 --> 00:15:44.958\nWhenever I go to visit A to Z, I think of my grandmother, Stella.\n\n00:15:44.958 --> 00:15:49.958\nShe was very much like those women sitting behind the sewing machines.\n\n00:15:49.958 --> 00:15:51.958\nShe grew up on a farm in Austria, very poor,\n\n00:15:51.958 -->

And the students wanted to speak to the government, and police answered with bullets. So every year, June 16, we will commemorate all those comrades or students who died. And I was very young then. I think I was 11 years, and I started asking questions, and that\u2019s when my political education started. And I joined, later on, the youth organization under the African National Congress. So as part of organizing this and whatever, this commemoration, the police will round us up as they call us leaders. And I used to run away from home, when I know that maybe the police might be coming around the ninth or 10th of June or so. And my grandmother one time said, \"No, look, you\u2019re not going to run away. This is your place, you stay here.\" And indeed, the police came \u2014 because they\u2019ll just arrest us and put us in jail and release us whenever they feel like, after the 20th or so.So it was on the 10th of June, and they came, and they surrounded the house, and my grandmother switched off all the lights in the house, and opened the kitchen door. And she said to them, \"Vusi's here, and you're not going to take him tonight. I'm tired of you having to come here, harassing us, while your children are sleeping peacefully in your homes.

And in fact, in 2000, I was ready to talk about eBay, but no call. In 2003, I was ready to do a talk about the Skoll Foundation and social entrepreneurship. No call. In 2004, I started Participant Productions and we had a really good first year, and no call. And finally, I get a call last year, and then I have to go up after J.J. Abrams. (Laughter) You've got a cruel sense of humor, TED. (Laughter)When I first moved to Hollywood from Silicon Valley, I had some misgivings. But I found that there were some advantages to being in Hollywood. (Laughter) And, in fact, some advantages to owning your own media company. And I also found that Hollywood and Silicon Valley have a lot more in common than I would have dreamed. Hollywood has its sex symbols, and the Valley has its sex symbols. (Laughter) Hollywood has its rivalries, and the Valley has its rivalries. Hollywood gathers around power tables, and the Valley gathers around power tables. So it turned out there was a lot more in common than I would have dreamed.But I'm actually here today to tell a story. And part of it is a personal story. When Chris invited me to speak, he said, people think of you as a bit of an enigma, and they want to know what drives you a bit. And what really drives me is a vision of the future that I think we all share. It's a world of peace and prosperity and sustainability. And when we heard a lot of the presentations over the last couple of days, Ed Wilson and the pictures of James Nachtwey, I think we all realized how far we have to go to get to this new version of humanity that I like to call \"Humanity 2.0.\" And it's also something that resides in each of us, to close what I think are the two big calamities in the world today.One is the gap in opportunity \u2014 this gap that President Clinton last night called uneven, unfair and unsustainable \u2014 and, out of that, comes poverty and illiteracy and disease and all these evils that we see around us. But perhaps the other, bigger gap is what we call the hope gap. And someone, at some point, came up with this very bad idea that an ordinary individual couldn't make a difference in the world. And I think that's just a horrible thing. And so chapter one really begins today, with all of us, because within each of us is the power to equal those opportunity gaps and to close the hope gaps. And if the men and women of TED can't make a difference in the world, I don't know who can.And for me, a lot of this started when I was younger and my family used to go camping in upstate New York. And there really wasn't much to do there for the summer, except get beaten up by my sister or read books. And so I used to read authors like James Michener and James Clavell and Ayn Rand. And their stories made the world seem a very small and interconnected place. And it struck me that if I could write stories that were about this world as being small and interconnected, that maybe I could get people interested in the issues that affected us all, and maybe engage them to make a difference.I didn't think that was necessarily the best way to make a living, so I decided to go on a path to become financially independent, so I could write these stories as quickly as I could. I then had a bit of a wake-up call when I was 14. And my dad came home one day and announced that he had cancer, and it looked pretty bad. And what he said was, he wasn't so much afraid that he might die, but that he hadn't done the things that he wanted to with his life. And knock on wood, he's still alive today, many years later. But for a young man that made a real impression on me, that one never knows how much time one really has. So I set out in a hurry. I studied engineering. I started a couple of businesses that I thought would be the ticket to financial freedom.One of those businesses was a computer rental business called Micros on the Move, which is very well named, because people kept stealing the computers. (Laughter) So I figured I needed to learn a little bit more about business, so I went to Stanford Business School and studied there. And while I was there, I made friends with a fellow named Pierre Omidyar, who is here today. And Pierre, I apologize for this. This is a photo from the old days. And just after I'd graduated, Pierre came to me with this idea to help people buy and sell things online with each other. And with the wisdom of my Stanford degree, I said, \"Pierre, what a stupid idea.\" (Laughter) And needless to say, I was right. (Laughter)But right after that, Pierre \u2014 in '96, Pierre and I left our full-time jobs to build eBay as a company. And the rest of that story, you know. The company went public two years later and is today one of the best known companies in the world. Hundreds of millions of people use it in hundreds of countries, and so on. But for me, personally, it was a real change. I went from living in a house with five guys in Palo Alto and living off their leftovers, to all of a sudden having all kinds of resources. And I wanted to figure out how I could take the blessing of these resources and share it with the world.And around that time, I met John Gardner, who is a remarkable man. He was the architect of the Great Society programs under Lyndon Johnson in the 1960s. And I asked him what he felt was the best thing I could do, or anyone could do, to make a difference in the long-term issues facing humanity. And John said, \"Bet on good people doing good things. Bet on good people doing good things.\" And that really resonated with me.I started a foundation to bet on these good people doing good things. These leading, innovative, nonprofit folks, who are using business skills in a very leveraged way to solve social problems. People today we call social entrepreneurs. And to put a face on it, people like Muhammad Yunus, who started the Grameen Bank, has lifted 100 million people plus out of poverty around the world, won the Nobel Peace Prize. But there's also a lot of people that you don't know. Folks like Ann Cotton, who started a group called CAMFED in Africa, because she felt girls' education was lagging. And she started it about 10 years ago, and today, she educates over a quarter million African girls. And somebody like Dr. Victoria Hale, who started the world's first nonprofit pharmaceutical company, and whose first drug will be fighting visceral leishmaniasis, also known as black fever. And by 2010, she hopes to eliminate this disease, which is really a scourge in the developing world. And so this is one way to bet on good people doing good things.And a lot of this comes together in a philosophy of change that I find really is powerful. It's what we call, \"Invest, connect and celebrate.\" And invest: if you see good people doing good things, invest in them. Invest in their organizations, or in business. Invest in these folks. Connecting them together through conferences \u2014 like a TED \u2014 brings so many powerful connections, or through the World Forum on Social Entrepreneurship that my foundation does at Oxford every year. And celebrate them: tell their stories, because not only are there good people doing good work, but their stories can help close these gaps of hope.And it was this last part of the mission, the celebrate part, that really got me back to thinking when I was a kid and wanted to tell stories to get people involved in the issues that affect us all. And a light bulb went off, which was, first, that I didn't actually have to do the writing myself, I could find writers. And then the next light bulb was, better than just writing, what about film and TV, to get out to people in a big way? And I thought about the films that inspired me, films like \"Gandhi\" and \"Schindler's List.\" And I wondered who was doing these kinds of films today. And there really wasn't a specific company that was focused on the public interest.So, in 2003, I started to make my way around Los Angeles to talk about the idea of a pro-social media company and I was met with a lot of encouragement. One of the lines of encouragement that I heard over and over was, \"The streets of Hollywood are littered with the carcasses of people like you, who think you're going to come to this town and make movies.\" And then of course, there was the other adage. \"The surest way to become a millionaire is to start by being a billionaire and go into the movie business.\" (Laughter)Undeterred, in January of 2004, I started Participant Productions with the vision to be a global media company focused on the public interest. And our mission is to produce entertainment that creates and inspires social change. And we don't just want people to see our movies and say, that was fun, and forget about it. We want them to actually get involved in the issues. In 2005, we launched our first slate of films, \"Murder Ball,\" \"North Country,\" \"Syriana\" and \"Good Night and Good Luck.\" And much to my surprise, they were noticed.We ended up with 11 Oscar nominations for these films. And it turned out to be a pretty good year for this guy. Perhaps more importantly, tens of thousands of people joined the advocacy programs and the activism programs that we created to go around the movies. And we had an online component of that, our community sect called Participate.net. But with our social sector partners, like the ACLU and PBS and the Sierra Club and the NRDC, once people saw the film, there was actually something they could do to make a difference.One of these films in particular, called \"North Country,\" was actually kind of a box office disaster. But it was a film that starred Charlize Theron and it was about women's rights, women's empowerment, domestic violence and so on. And we released the film at the same time that the Congress was debating the renewal of the Violence Against Women Act. And with screenings on the Hill, and discussions, and with our social sector partners, like the National Organization of Women, the film was widely credited with influencing the successful renewal of the act. And that to me, spoke volumes, because it's \u2014 the film started about a true-life story about a woman who was harassed, sued her employer, led to a landmark case that led to the Equal Opportunity Act, and the Violence Against Women Act and others. And then the movie about this person doing these things, then led to this greater renewal. And so again, it goes back to betting on good people doing good things.Speaking of which, our fellow TEDster, Al \u2014 I first saw Al do his slide show presentation on global warming in May of 2005. At that point, I thought I knew something about global warming. I thought it was a 30 to 50 year problem. And after we saw his slide show, it became clear that it was much more urgent. And so right afterwards, I met backstage with Al, and with Lawrence Bender, who was there, and Laurie David, and Davis Guggenheim, who was running documentaries for Participant at the time. And with Al's blessing, we decided on the spot to turn it into a film, because we felt that we could get the message out there far more quickly than having Al go around the world, speaking to audiences of 100 or 200 at a time.And you know, there's another adage in Hollywood, that nobody knows nothing about anything. And I really thought this was going to be a straight-to-PBS charitable initiative. And so it was a great shock to all of us when the film really captured the public interest, and today is mandatory viewing in schools in England and Scotland, and most of Scandinavia. We've sent 50,000 DVDs to high school teachers in the U.S. and it's really changed the debate on global warming. It was also a pretty good year for this guy. We now call Al the George Clooney of global warming. (Laughter)And for Participant, this is just the start. Everything we do looks at the major issues in the world. And we have 10 films in production right now, and dozens others in development. I'll quickly talk about a few coming up. One is \"Charlie Wilson's War,\" with Tom Hanks and Julia Roberts. And it's the true story of Congressman Charlie Wilson, and how he funded the Taliban to fight the Russians in Afghanistan. And we're also doing a movie called \"The Kite Runner,\" based on the book \"The Kite Runner,\" also about Afghanistan. And we think once people see these films, they'll have a much better understanding of that part of the world and the Middle East in general.We premiered a film called \"The Chicago 10\" at Sundance this year. It's based on the protesters at the Democratic Convention in 1968, Abby Hoffman and crew, and, again, a story about a small group of individuals who did make change in the world. And a documentary that we're doing on Jimmy Carter and his Mid-East peace efforts over the years. And in particular, we've been following him on his recent book tour, which, as many of you know, has been very non-controversial \u2014 (Laughter) \u2014 which is really bad for getting people to come see a movie.In closing, I'd like to say that everybody has the opportunity to make change in their own way. And all the people in this room have done so through their business lives, or their philanthropic work, or their other interests. And one thing that I've learned is that there's never one right way to make change. One can do it as a tech person, or as a finance person, or a nonprofit person, or as an entertainment person, but every one of us is all of those things and more.And I believe if we do these things, we can close the opportunity gaps, we can close the hope gaps. And I can imagine, if we do this, the headlines in 10 years might read something like these: \"New AIDS Cases in Africa Fall to Zero,\" \"U.S. Imports its Last Barrel of Oil\" \u2014 (Applause) \u2014 \"Israelis and Palestinians Celebrate 10 Years of Peaceful Coexistence.\" (Applause) And I like this one, \"Snow Has Returned to Kilimanjaro.\" (Laughter) And finally, an eBay listing for one well-traveled slide show, now obsolete, museum piece. Please contact Al Gore. And I believe that, working together, we can make all of these things happen. And I want to thank you all for having me here today. It's been a real honor. Thank you.

When Chris invited me to speak,\n\n00:01:37.958 --> 00:01:39.958\nhe said, people think of you as a bit of an enigma,\n\n00:01:39.958 --> 00:01:41.958\nand they want to know what drives you a bit.\n\n00:01:42.958 --> 00:01:44.958\nAnd what really drives me is a vision of the future\n\n00:01:45.958 --> 00:01:46.958\nthat I think we all share.\n\n00:01:46.958 --> 00:01:50.958\nIt's a world of peace and prosperity and sustainability.\n\n00:01:50.958 --> 00:01:55.958\nAnd when we heard a lot of the presentations\n\n00:01:55.958 --> 00:01:56.958\nover the last couple of days,\n\n00:01:56.958 --> 00:02:00.958\nEd Wilson and the pictures of James Nachtwey,\n\n00:02:00.958 --> 00:02:02.958\nI think we all realized how far we have to go\n\n00:02:02.958 --> 00:02:03.958\nto get to this new version of humanity\n\n00:02:03.958 --> 00:02:05.958\nthat I like to call \"Humanity 2.0.\"\n\n00:02:06.958 --> 00:02:11.958\nAnd it's also something that resides in each of us,\n\n00:02:11.958 --> 00:02:12.958\nto close what I think\n\n00:02:12.958 --> 00:02:15.958\nare the two big calamities in the world today.\n\n00:02:16.958 --> 00:02:19.958\nOne is the gap in opportunity --\n\n00:02:19.958 --> 00:02:22.958\nthis gap that President Clinton last night\n\n00:02:22.958 --> 00:02:25.958\ncalled uneven, unfair and unsustainable --\n\n00:02:25.958 --> 00:02:28.958\nand, out of that, comes poverty and illiteracy and disease\n\n00:02:28.958 --> 00:02:30.958\nand all these evils that we see around us.\n\n00:02:31.958 --> 00:02:35.958\nBut perhaps the other, bigger gap is what we call the hope gap.\n\n00:02:36.958 --> 00:02:39.958\nAnd someone, at some point, came up with this very bad idea\n\n00:02:39.958 --> 00:02:42.958\nthat an ordinary individual couldn't make a difference in the world.\n\n00:02:43.958 --> 00:02:45.958\nAnd I think that's just a horrible thing.\n\n00:02:45.958 --> 00:02:49.958\nAnd so chapter one really begins today, with all of us,\n\n00:02:49.958 --> 00:02:52.958\nbecause within each of us is the power to\n\n00:02:53.958 --> 00:02:56.958\nequal those opportunity gaps and to close the hope gaps.\n\n00:02:56.958 --> 00:02:58.958\nAnd if the men and women of TED\n\n00:02:58.958 --> 00:03:00.958\ncan't make a difference in the world, I don't know who can.\n\n00:03:01.958 --> 00:03:04.958\nAnd for me, a lot of this started when I was younger\n\n00:03:04.958 --> 00:03:07.958\nand my family used to go camping in upstate New York.\n\n00:03:08.958 --> 00:03:10.958\nAnd there really wasn't much to do there for the summer,\n\n00:03:10.958 --> 00:03:13.958\nexcept get beaten up by my sister or read books.\n\n00:03:14.958 --> 00:03:17.958\nAnd so I used to read authors like James Michener\n\n00:03:17.958 --> 00:03:19.958\nand James Clavell and Ayn Rand.\n\n00:03:19.958 --> 00:03:23.958\nAnd their stories made the world seem a very small\n\n00:03:23.958 --> 00:03:25.958\nand interconnected place.\n\n00:03:25.958 --> 00:03:28.958\nAnd it struck me that if I could write stories\n\n00:03:29.958 --> 00:03:31.958\nthat were about this world as being small and interconnected,\n\n00:03:31.958 --> 00:03:35.958\nthat maybe I could get people interested in the issues\n\n00:03:35.958 --> 00:03:38.958\nthat affected us all, and maybe engage them to make a difference.\n\n00:03:39.958 --> 00:03:42.958\nI didn't think that was necessarily the best way to make a living,\n\n00:03:43.958 --> 00:03:47.958\nso I decided to go on a path to become financially independent,\n\n00:03:47.958 --> 00:03:49.958\nso I could write these stories as quickly as I could.\n\n00:03:51.958 --> 00:03:54.958\nI then had a bit of a wake-up call when I was 14.\n\n00:03:54.958 --> 00:03:56.958\nAnd my dad came home one day\n\n00:03:56.958 --> 00:03:59.958\nand announced that he had cancer, and it looked pretty bad.\n\n00:04:00.958 --> 00:04:04.958\nAnd what he said was, he wasn't so much afraid that he might die,\n\n00:04:04.958 --> 00:04:08.958\nbut that he hadn't done the things that he wanted to with his life.\n\n00:04:09.958 --> 00:04:13.958\nAnd knock on wood, he's still alive today, many years later.\n\n00:04:13.958 --> 00:04:16.958\nBut for a young man that made a real impression on me,\n\n00:04:16.958 --> 00:04:19.958\nthat one never knows how much time one really has.\n\n00:04:19.958 --> 00:04:23.958\nSo I set out in a hurry. I studied engineering.\n\n00:04:24.958 --> 00:04:26.958\nI started a couple of businesses\n\n00:04:26.958 --> 00:04:28.958\nthat I thought would be the ticket to financial freedom.\n\n00:04:29.958 --> 00:04:32.958\nOne of those businesses was a computer rental business\n\n00:04:32.958 --> 00:04:33.958\ncalled Micros on the Move,\n\n00:04:33.958 --> 00:04:34.958\nwhich is very well named,\n\n00:04:34.958 --> 00:04:36.958\nbecause people kept stealing the computers.\n\n00:04:36.958 --> 00:04:37.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:04:37.958 --> 00:04:41.958\nSo I figured I needed to learn a little bit more about business,\n\n00:04:41.958 --> 00:04:43.958\nso I went to Stanford Business School and studied there.\n\n00:04:44.958 --> 00:04:47.958\nAnd while I was there, I made friends with a fellow\n\n00:04:47.958 --> 00:04:50.958\nnamed Pierre Omidyar, who is here today. And Pierre, I apologize\n\n00:04:50.958 --> 00:04:52.958\nfor this. This is a photo from the old days.\n\n00:04:53.958 --> 00:04:55.958\nAnd just after I'd graduated, Pierre came to me\n\n00:04:55.958 --> 00:04:57.958\nwith this idea to help people\n\n00:04:57.958 --> 00:04:58.958\nbuy and sell things online with each other.\n\n00:04:59.958 --> 00:05:01.958\nAnd with the wisdom of my Stanford degree,\n\n00:05:01.958 --> 00:05:03.958\nI said, \"Pierre, what a stupid idea.\"\n\n00:05:03.958 --> 00:05:04.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:05:04.958 --> 00:05:05.958\nAnd needless to say, I was right.\n\n00:05:05.958 --> 00:05:06.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:05:07.958 --> 00:05:11.958\nBut right after that, Pierre -- in '96, Pierre and I left our full-time jobs\n\n00:05:11.958 --> 00:05:15.958\nto build eBay as a company. And the rest of that story, you know.\n\n00:05:16.958 --> 00:05:17.958\nThe company went public two years later\n\n00:05:18.958 --> 00:05:20.958\nand is today one of the best known companies in the world.\n\n00:05:21.958 --> 00:05:25.958\nHundreds of millions of people use it in hundreds of countries, and so on.\n\n00:05:25.958 --> 00:05:29.958\nBut for me, personally, it was a real change.\n\n00:05:29.958 --> 00:05:33.958\nI went from living in a house with five guys in Palo Alto\n\n00:05:33.958 --> 00:05:34.958\nand living off their leftovers,\n\n00:05:34.958 --> 00:05:38.958\nto all of a sudden having all kinds of resources.\n\n00:05:38.958 --> 00:05:40.958\nAnd I wanted to figure out how I could\n\n00:05:40.958 --> 00:05:44.958\ntake the blessing of these resources and share it with the world.\n\n00:05:44.958 --> 00:05:47.958\nAnd around that time, I met John Gardner,\n\n00:05:47.958 --> 00:05:48.958\nwho is a remarkable man.\n\n00:05:49.958 --> 00:05:53.958\nHe was the architect of the Great Society programs\n\n00:05:53.958 --> 00:05:55.958\nunder Lyndon Johnson in the 1960s.\n\n00:05:55.958 --> 00:05:58.958\nAnd I asked him what he felt was the best thing I could do,\n\n00:05:58.958 --> 00:06:00.958\nor anyone could do, to make a difference\n\n00:06:00.958 --> 00:06:03.958\nin the long-term issues facing humanity.\n\n00:06:04.958 --> 00:06:07.958\nAnd John said, \"Bet on good people doing good things.\n\n00:06:08.958 --> 00:06:10.958\nBet on good people doing good things.\"\n\n00:06:10.958 --> 00:06:11.958\nAnd that really resonated with me.\n\n00:06:12.958 --> 00:06:14.958\nI started a foundation\n\n00:06:14.958 --> 00:06:16.958\nto bet on these good people doing good things.\n\n00:06:16.958 --> 00:06:19.958\nThese leading, innovative, nonprofit folks,\n\n00:06:19.958 --> 00:06:22.958\nwho are using business skills in a very leveraged way\n\n00:06:22.958 --> 00:06:24.958\nto solve social problems.\n\n00:06:24.958 --> 00:06:26.958\nPeople today we call social entrepreneurs.\n\n00:06:27.958 --> 00:06:29.958\nAnd to put a face on it, people like Muhammad Yunus,\n\n00:06:29.958 --> 00:06:31.958\nwho started the Grameen Bank,\n\n00:06:31.958 --> 00:06:35.958\nhas lifted 100 million people plus out of poverty around the world,\n\n00:06:35.958 --> 00:06:36.958\nwon the Nobel Peace Prize.\n\n00:06:36.958 --> 00:06:39.958\nBut there's also a lot of people that you don't know.\n\n00:06:39.958 --> 00:06:43.958\nFolks like Ann Cotton, who started a group called CAMFED in Africa,\n\n00:06:43.958 --> 00:06:46.958\nbecause she felt girls' education was lagging.\n\n00:06:46.958 --> 00:06:48.958\nAnd she started it about 10 years ago,\n\n00:06:48.958 --> 00:06:53.958\nand today, she educates over a quarter million African girls.\n\n00:06:53.958 --> 00:06:56.958\nAnd somebody like Dr. Victoria Hale,\n\n00:06:56.958 --> 00:06:59.958\nwho started the world's first nonprofit pharmaceutical company,\n\n00:06:59.958 --> 00:07:05.958\nand whose first drug will be fighting visceral leishmaniasis,\n\n00:07:05.958 --> 00:07:07.958\nalso known as black fever.\n\n00:07:07.958 --> 00:07:10.958\nAnd by 2010, she hopes to eliminate this disease,\n\n00:07:10.958 --> 00:07:13.958\nwhich is really a scourge in the developing world.\n\n00:07:13.958 --> 00:07:15.958\nAnd so this is one way to bet\n\n00:07:15.958 --> 00:07:16.958\non good people doing good things.\n\n00:07:16.958 --> 00:07:20.958\nAnd a lot of this comes together in a philosophy of change\n\n00:07:20.958 --> 00:07:23.958\nthat I find really is powerful.\n\n00:07:24.958 --> 00:07:26.958\nIt's what we call, \"Invest, connect and celebrate.\"\n\n00:07:26.958 --> 00:07:29.958\nAnd invest: if you see good people doing good things,\n\n00:07:29.958 --> 00:07:31.958\ninvest in them. Invest in their organizations,\n\n00:07:31.958 --> 00:07:33.958\nor in business. Invest in these folks.\n\n00:07:34.958 --> 00:07:36.958\nConnecting them together through conferences --\n\n00:07:36.958 --> 00:07:39.958\nlike a TED -- brings so many powerful connections,\n\n00:07:39.958 --> 00:07:42.958\nor through the World Forum on Social Entrepreneurship\n\n00:07:42.958 --> 00:07:45.958\nthat my foundation does at Oxford every year.\n\n00:07:45.958 --> 00:07:48.958\nAnd celebrate them: tell their stories,\n\n00:07:48.958 --> 00:07:50.958\nbecause not only are there good people doing good work,\n\n00:07:50.958 --> 00:07:54.958\nbut their stories can help close these gaps of hope.\n\n00:07:55.958 --> 00:07:58.958\nAnd it was this last part of the mission, the celebrate part,\n\n00:07:58.958 --> 00:08:02.958\nthat really got me back to thinking when I was a kid\n\n00:08:02.958 --> 00:08:04.958\nand wanted to tell stories to get people involved\n\n00:08:04.958 --> 00:08:06.958\nin the issues that affect us all.\n\n00:08:06.958 --> 00:08:08.958\nAnd a light bulb went off,\n\n00:08:08.958 --> 00:08:13.958\nwhich was, first, that I didn't actually have to do the writing myself, I could find writers.\n\n00:08:13.958 --> 00:08:16.958\nAnd then the next light bulb was, better than just writing,\n\n00:08:16.958 --> 00:08:20.958\nwhat about film and TV, to get out to people in a big way?\n\n00:08:20.958 --> 00:08:22.958\nAnd I thought about the films that inspired me,\n\n00:08:22.958 --> 00:08:25.958\nfilms like \"Gandhi\" and \"Schindler's List.\"\n\n00:08:25.958 --> 00:08:28.958\nAnd I wondered who was doing these kinds of films today.\n\n00:08:28.958 --> 00:08:31.958\nAnd there really wasn't a specific company\n\n00:08:31.958 --> 00:08:33.958\nthat was focused on the public interest.\n\n00:08:34.958 --> 00:08:39.958\nSo, in 2003, I started to make my way around Los Angeles\n\n00:08:39.958 --> 00:08:42.958\nto talk about the idea of a pro-social media company\n\n00:08:42.958 --> 00:08:45.958\nand I was met with a lot of encouragement.\n\n00:08:45.958 --> 00:08:48.958\nOne of the lines of encouragement\n\n00:08:48.958 --> 00:08:50.958\nthat I heard over and over was,\n\n00:08:50.958 --> 00:08:54.958\n\"The streets of Hollywood are littered with the carcasses of people like you,\n\n00:08:54.958 --> 00:08:57.958\nwho think you're going to come to this town and make movies.\"\n\n00:08:57.958 --> 00:08:59.958\nAnd then of course, there was the other adage.\n\n00:08:59.958 --> 00:09:01.958\n\"The surest way to become a millionaire\n\n00:09:01.958 --> 00:09:04.958\nis to start by being a billionaire and go into the movie business.\"\n\n00:09:04.958 --> 00:09:06.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:09:06.958 --> 00:09:11.958\nUndeterred, in January of 2004, I started Participant Productions\n\n00:09:11.958 --> 00:09:14.958\nwith the vision to be a global media company\n\n00:09:14.958 --> 00:09:15.958\nfocused on the public interest.\n\n00:09:16.958 --> 00:09:18.958\nAnd our mission is to produce entertainment\n\n00:09:18.958 --> 00:09:20.958\nthat creates and inspires social change.\n\n00:09:20.958 --> 00:09:23.958\nAnd we don't just want people to see our movies\n\n00:09:23.958 --> 00:09:25.958\nand say, that was fun, and forget about it.\n\n00:09:25.958 --> 00:09:27.958\nWe want them to actually get involved in the issues.\n\n00:09:28.958 --> 00:09:31.958\nIn 2005, we launched our first slate of films,\n\n00:09:31.958 --> 00:09:34.958\n\"Murder Ball,\" \"North Country,\" \"Syriana\"\n\n00:09:34.958 --> 00:09:35.958\nand \"Good Night and Good Luck.\"\n\n00:09:35.958 --> 00:09:37.958\nAnd much to my surprise, they were noticed.\n\n00:09:38.958 --> 00:09:41.958\nWe ended up with 11 Oscar nominations for these films.\n\n00:09:42.958 --> 00:09:45.958\nAnd it turned out to be a pretty good year for this guy.\n\n00:09:45.958 --> 00:09:46.958\nPerhaps more importantly,\n\n00:09:46.958 --> 00:09:50.958\ntens of thousands of people joined the advocacy programs\n\n00:09:50.958 --> 00:09:52.958\nand the activism programs\n\n00:09:52.958 --> 00:09:54.958\nthat we created to go around the movies.\n\n00:09:54.958 --> 00:09:57.958\nAnd we had an online component of that,\n\n00:09:57.958 --> 00:09:59.958\nour community sect called Participate.net.\n\n00:09:59.958 --> 00:10:04.958\nBut with our social sector partners, like the ACLU and PBS and the\n\n00:10:04.958 --> 00:10:07.958\nSierra Club and the NRDC, once people saw the film,\n\n00:10:07.958 --> 00:10:10.958\nthere was actually something they could do to make a difference.\n\n00:10:11.958 --> 00:10:16.958\nOne of these films in particular, called \"North Country,\" was actually\n\n00:10:17.958 --> 00:10:18.958\nkind of a box office disaster.\n\n00:10:19.958 --> 00:10:22.958\nBut it was a film that starred Charlize Theron\n\n00:10:22.958 --> 00:10:24.958\nand it was about women's rights, women's empowerment,\n\n00:10:25.958 --> 00:10:27.958\ndomestic violence and so on.\n\n00:10:27.958 --> 00:10:30.958\nAnd we released the film at the same time that\n\n00:10:30.958 --> 00:10:35.958\nthe Congress was debating the renewal of the Violence Against Women Act.\n\n00:10:35.958 --> 00:10:38.958\nAnd with screenings on the Hill, and discussions,\n\n00:10:38.958 --> 00:10:40.958\nand with our social sector partners,\n\n00:10:40.958 --> 00:10:42.958\nlike the National Organization of Women,\n\n00:10:43.958 --> 00:10:45.958\nthe film was widely credited\n\n00:10:45.958 --> 00:10:49.958\nwith influencing the successful renewal of the act.\n\n00:10:49.958 --> 00:10:53.958\nAnd that to me, spoke volumes, because it's --\n\n00:10:53.958 --> 00:10:55.958\nthe film started about a true-life story\n\n00:10:55.958 --> 00:10:59.958\nabout a woman who was harassed, sued her employer,\n\n00:10:59.958 --> 00:11:02.958\nled to a landmark case that led to the Equal Opportunity Act,\n\n00:11:02.958 --> 00:11:04.958\nand the Violence Against Women Act and others.\n\n00:11:04.958 --> 00:11:07.958\nAnd then the movie about this person doing these things,\n\n00:11:07.958 --> 00:11:10.958\nthen led to this greater renewal.\n\n00:11:11.958 --> 00:11:12.958\nAnd so again,\n\n00:11:12.958 --> 00:11:15.958\nit goes back to betting on good people doing good things.\n\n00:11:16.958 --> 00:11:19.958\nSpeaking of which, our fellow TEDster, Al --\n\n00:11:19.958 --> 00:11:22.958\nI first saw Al do his slide show presentation\n\n00:11:22.958 --> 00:11:25.958\non global warming in May of 2005.\n\n00:11:26.958 --> 00:11:29.958\nAt that point, I thought I knew something about global warming.\n\n00:11:29.958 --> 00:11:31.958\nI thought it was a 30 to 50 year problem.\n\n00:11:31.958 --> 00:11:33.958\nAnd after we saw his slide show,\n\n00:11:33.958 --> 00:11:35.958\nit became clear that it was much more urgent.\n\n00:11:36.958 --> 00:11:40.958\nAnd so right afterwards, I met backstage with Al, and\n\n00:11:40.958 --> 00:11:42.958\nwith Lawrence Bender, who was there, and Laurie David,\n\n00:11:42.958 --> 00:11:44.958\nand Davis Guggenheim,\n\n00:11:44.958 --> 00:11:48.958\nwho was running documentaries for Participant at the time.\n\n00:11:48.958 --> 00:11:52.958\nAnd with Al's blessing, we decided on the spot to turn it into a film,\n\n00:11:52.958 --> 00:11:55.958\nbecause we felt that we could get the message out there\n\n00:11:55.958 --> 00:11:59.958\nfar more quickly than having Al go around the world,\n\n00:11:59.958 --> 00:12:01.958\nspeaking to audiences of 100 or 200 at a time.\n\n00:12:01.958 --> 00:12:04.958\nAnd you know, there's another adage in Hollywood,\n\n00:12:04.958 --> 00:12:06.958\nthat nobody knows nothing about anything.\n\n00:12:06.958 --> 00:12:08.958\nAnd I really thought this was going to be\n\n00:12:08.958 --> 00:12:12.958\na straight-to-PBS charitable initiative.\n\n00:12:12.958 --> 00:12:15.958\nAnd so it was a great shock to all of us\n\n00:12:15.958 --> 00:12:18.958\nwhen the film really captured the public interest,\n\n00:12:18.958 --> 00:12:22.958\nand today is mandatory viewing in schools in England and Scotland,\n\n00:12:22.958 --> 00:12:24.958\nand most of Scandinavia.\n\n00:12:24.958 --> 00:12:30.958\nWe've sent 50,000 DVDs to high school teachers in the U.S.\n\n00:12:30.958 --> 00:12:34.958\nand it's really changed the debate on global warming.\n\n00:12:34.958 --> 00:12:36.958\nIt was also a pretty good year for this guy.\n\n00:12:36.958 --> 00:12:39.958\nWe now call Al the George Clooney of global warming.\n\n00:12:39.958 --> 00:12:41.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:12:41.958 --> 00:12:45.958\nAnd for Participant, this is just the start.\n\n00:12:45.958 --> 00:12:47.958\nEverything we do looks at the major issues in the world.\n\n00:12:47.958 --> 00:12:50.958\nAnd we have 10 films in production right now,\n\n00:12:50.958 --> 00:12:52.958\nand dozens others in development.\n\n00:12:53.958 --> 00:12:55.958\nI'll quickly talk about a few coming up.\n\n00:12:55.958 --> 00:12:59.958\nOne is \"Charlie Wilson's War,\" with Tom Hanks and Julia Roberts.\n\n00:12:59.958 --> 00:13:02.958\nAnd it's the true story of Congressman Charlie Wilson, and\n\n00:13:02.958 --> 00:13:07.958\nhow he funded the Taliban to fight the Russians in Afghanistan.\n\n00:13:07.958 --> 00:13:09.958\nAnd we're also doing a movie called \"The Kite Runner,\"\n\n00:13:09.958 --> 00:13:13.958\nbased on the book \"The Kite Runner,\" also about Afghanistan.\n\n00:13:13.958 --> 00:13:14.958\nAnd we think once people see these films,\n\n00:13:14.958 --> 00:13:17.958\nthey'll have a much better understanding of that part of the world\n\n00:13:17.958 --> 00:13:19.958\nand the Middle East in general.\n\n00:13:19.958 --> 00:13:23.958\nWe premiered a film called \"The Chicago 10\" at Sundance this year.\n\n00:13:23.958 --> 00:13:27.958\nIt's based on the protesters at the Democratic Convention in 1968,\n\n00:13:27.958 --> 00:13:29.958\nAbby Hoffman and crew,\n\n00:13:29.958 --> 00:13:32.958\nand, again, a story about a small group of individuals\n\n00:13:33.958 --> 00:13:35.958\nwho did make change in the world.\n\n00:13:35.958 --> 00:13:39.958\nAnd a documentary that we're doing on Jimmy Carter\n\n00:13:39.958 --> 00:13:41.958\nand his Mid-East peace efforts over the years.\n\n00:13:41.958 --> 00:13:46.958\nAnd in particular, we've been following him on his recent book tour,\n\n00:13:46.958 --> 00:13:49.958\nwhich, as many of you know, has been very non-controversial --\n\n00:13:49.958 --> 00:13:50.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:13:50.958 --> 00:13:53.958\n-- which is really bad for getting people to come see a movie.\n\n00:13:53.958 --> 00:13:57.958\nIn closing, I'd like to say that everybody has the opportunity\n\n00:13:57.958 --> 00:13:59.958\nto make change in their own way.\n\n00:13:59.958 --> 00:14:02.958\nAnd all the people in this room\n\n00:14:02.958 --> 00:14:04.958\nhave done so through their business lives,\n\n00:14:04.958 --> 00:14:07.958\nor their philanthropic work, or their other interests.\n\n00:14:08.958 --> 00:14:09.958\nAnd one thing that I've learned\n\n00:14:10.958 --> 00:14:12.958\nis that there's never one right way to make change.\n\n00:14:12.958 --> 00:14:15.958\nOne can do it as a tech person, or as a finance person,\n\n00:14:15.958 --> 00:14:19.958\nor a nonprofit person, or as an entertainment person,\n\n00:14:19.958 --> 00:14:23.958\nbut every one of us is all of those things and more.\n\n00:14:23.958 --> 00:14:26.958\nAnd I believe if we do these things,\n\n00:14:26.958 --> 00:14:30.958\nwe can close the opportunity gaps, we can close the hope gaps.\n\n00:14:30.958 --> 00:14:32.958\nAnd I can imagine, if we do this,\n\n00:14:32.958 --> 00:14:35.958\nthe headlines in 10 years might read something like these:\n\n00:14:37.958 --> 00:14:40.958\n\"New AIDS Cases in Africa Fall to Zero,\"\n\n00:14:40.958 --> 00:14:43.958\n\"U.S. Imports its Last Barrel of Oil\" --\n\n00:14:43.958 --> 00:14:45.958\n(Applause)\n\n00:14:45.958 --> 00:14:49.958\n-- \"Israelis and

We have 14 out of the 21 degrees of freedom; you don't need the ones in the last two fingers. We put this thing together. A couple of weeks ago we took it down to Walter Reed, which is unfortunately more in the news these days. We showed it to a bunch of guys. One guy who described himself as being lucky, because he lost his left arm, and he's a righty. He sat at a table with seven or eight of these other guys. Said he was lucky, because he had his good arm, and then he pushed himself back from the table. He had no legs. These kids have attitudes that you just can't believe.So I'm going to show you now, without the skin on it, a 30-second piece, and then I'm done. But understand what you're looking at we made small enough to fit on a 50th percentile female, so that we could put it in any of these people. It's going to go inside something that we use in CAT scans and MRIs of whatever is their good arm, to make silicon rubber, then coat it, and paint it in 3D \u2014 exact mirror image of their other limb.

You know, in a dictionary? (Laughter) Yeah, that's what I thought. How about this word? Here, I'll show it to you. Lexicography: the practice of compiling dictionaries. Notice \u2014 we're very specific \u2014 that word \"compile.\" The dictionary is not carved out of a piece of granite, out of a lump of rock. It's made up of lots of little bits. It's little discrete \u2014 that's spelled D-I-S-C-R-E-T-E \u2014 bits. And those bits are words.Now one of the perks of being a lexicographer \u2014 besides getting to come to TED \u2014 is that you get to say really fun words, like lexicographical. Lexicographical has this great pattern: it's called a double dactyl. And just by saying double dactyl, I've sent the geek needle all the way into the red. (Laughter) (Applause) But \"lexicographical\" is the same pattern as \"higgledy-piggledy.\" Right? It's a fun word to say, and I get to say it a lot. Now, one of the non-perks of being a lexicographer is that people don't usually have a kind of warm, fuzzy, snuggly image of the dictionary. Right? Nobody hugs their dictionaries. But what people really often think about the dictionary is, they think more like this. Just to let you know, I do not have a lexicographical whistle. But people think that my job is to let the good words make that difficult left-hand turn into the dictionary, and keep the bad words out.But the thing is, I don't want to be a traffic cop. For one thing, I just do not do uniforms. And for another, deciding what words are good and what words are bad is actually not very easy. And it's not very fun. And when parts of your job are not easy or fun, you kind of look for an excuse not to do them. So if I had to think of some kind of occupation as a metaphor for my work, I would much rather be a fisherman. I want to throw my big net into the deep, blue ocean of English and see what marvelous creatures I can drag up from the bottom. But why do people want me to direct traffic, when I would much rather go fishing? Well, I blame the Queen. Why do I blame the Queen? Well, first of all, I blame the Queen because it's funny. But secondly, I blame the Queen because dictionaries have really not changed.Our idea of what a dictionary is has not changed since her reign. The only thing that Queen Victoria would not be amused by in modern dictionaries is our inclusion of the F-word, which has happened in American dictionaries since 1965. So, there's this guy, right? Victorian era. James Murray, first editor of the Oxford English Dictionary. I do not have that hat. I wish I had that hat. So he's really responsible for a lot of what we consider modern in dictionaries today. When a guy who looks like that, in that hat, is the face of modernity, you have a problem. And so, James Murray could get a job on any dictionary today. There'd be virtually no learning curve.And of course, a few of us are saying: okay, computers! Computers! What about computers? The thing about computers is, I love computers. I mean, I'm a huge geek, I love computers. I would go on a hunger strike before I let them take away Google Book Search from me. But computers don't do much else other than speed up the process of compiling dictionaries. They don't change the end result. Because what a dictionary is, is it's Victorian design merged with a little bit of modern propulsion. It's steampunk. What we have is an electric velocipede. You know, we have Victorian design with an engine on it. That's all! The design has not changed.And OK, what about online dictionaries, right? Online dictionaries must be different. This is the Oxford English Dictionary Online, one of the best online dictionaries. This is my favorite word, by the way. Erinaceous: pertaining to the hedgehog family; of the nature of a hedgehog. Very useful word. So, look at that. Online dictionaries right now are paper thrown up on a screen. This is flat. Look how many links there are in the actual entry: two! Right? Those little buttons, I had them all expanded except for the date chart. So there's not very much going on here. There's not a lot of clickiness. And in fact, online dictionaries replicate almost all the problems of print, except for searchability. And when you improve searchability, you actually take away the one advantage of print, which is serendipity. Serendipity is when you find things you weren't looking for, because finding what you are looking for is so damned difficult.So \u2014 (Laughter) (Applause) \u2014 now, when you think about this, what we have here is a ham butt problem. Does everyone know the ham butt problem? Woman's making a ham for a big, family dinner. She goes to cut the butt off the ham and throw it away, and she looks at this piece of ham and she's like, \"This is a perfectly good piece of ham. Why am I throwing this away?\" She thought, \"Well, my mom always did this.\" So she calls up mom, and she says, \"Mom, why'd you cut the butt off the ham, when you're making a ham?\" She says, \"I don't know, my mom always did it!\" So they call grandma, and grandma says, \"My pan was too small!\" (Laughter)So, it's not that we have good words and bad words. We have a pan that's too small! You know, that ham butt is delicious! There's no reason to throw it away. The bad words \u2014 see, when people think about a place and they don't find a place on the map, they think, \"This map sucks!\" When they find a nightspot or a bar, and it's not in the guidebook, they're like, \"Ooh, this place must be cool! It's not in the guidebook.\" When they find a word that's not in the dictionary, they think, \"This must be a bad word.\" Why? It's more likely to be a bad dictionary. Why are you blaming the ham for being too big for the pan? So, you can't get a smaller ham. The English language is as big as it is.So, if you have a ham butt problem, and you're thinking about the ham butt problem, the conclusion that it leads you to is inexorable and counterintuitive: paper is the enemy of words. How can this be? I mean, I love books. I really love books. Some of my best friends are books. But the book is not the best shape for the dictionary. Now they're going to think \"Oh, boy. People are going to take away my beautiful, paper dictionaries?\" No. There will still be paper dictionaries. When we had cars \u2014 when cars became the dominant mode of transportation, we didn't round up all the horses and shoot them. You know, there're still going to be paper dictionaries, but it's not going to be the dominant dictionary. The book-shaped dictionary is not going to be the only shape dictionaries come in. And it's not going to be the prototype for the shapes dictionaries come in.So, think about it this way: if you've got an artificial constraint, artificial constraints lead to arbitrary distinctions and a skewed worldview. What if biologists could only study animals that made people go, \"Aww.\" Right? What if we made aesthetic judgments about animals, and only the ones we thought were cute were the ones that we could study? We'd know a whole lot about charismatic megafauna, and not very much about much else. And I think this is a problem. I think we should study all the words, because when you think about words, you can make beautiful expressions from very humble parts. Lexicography is really more about material science. We are studying the tolerances of the materials that you use to build the structure of your expression: your speeches and your writing. And then, often people say to me, \"Well, OK, how do I know that this word is real?\" They think, \"OK, if we think words are the tools that we use to build the expressions of our thoughts, how can you say that screwdrivers are better than hammers? How can you say that a sledgehammer is better than a ball-peen hammer?\" They're just the right tools for the job.And so people say to me, \"How do I know if a word is real?\" You know, anybody who's read a children's book knows that love makes things real. If you love a word, use it. That makes it real. Being in the dictionary is an artificial distinction. It doesn't make a word any more real than any other way. If you love a word, it becomes real. So if we're not worrying about directing traffic, if we've transcended paper, if we are worrying less about control and more about description, then we can think of the English language as being this beautiful mobile. And any time one of those little parts of the mobile changes, is touched, any time you touch a word, you use it in a new context, you give it a new connotation, you verb it, you make the mobile move. You didn't break it. It's just in a new position, and that new position can be just as beautiful.Now, if you're no longer a traffic cop \u2014 the problem with being a traffic cop is there can only be so many traffic cops in any one intersection, or the cars get confused. Right? But if your goal is no longer to direct the traffic, but maybe to count the cars that go by, then more eyeballs are better. You can ask for help! If you ask for help, you get more done. And we really need help. Library of Congress: 17 million books, of which half are in English. If only one out of every 10 of those books had a word that's not in the dictionary in it, that would be equivalent to more than two unabridged dictionaries.And I find an un-dictionaried word \u2014 a word like \"un-dictionaried,\" for example \u2014 in almost every book I read. What about newspapers? Newspaper archive goes back to 1759, 58.1 million newspaper pages. If only one in 100 of those pages had an un-dictionaried word on it, it would be an entire other OED. That's 500,000 more words. So that's a lot. And I'm not even talking about magazines. I'm not talking about blogs \u2014 and I find more new words on BoingBoing in a given week than I do Newsweek or Time. There's a lot going on there.And I'm not even talking about polysemy, which is the greedy habit some words have of taking more than one meaning for themselves. So if you think of the word \"set,\" a set can be a badger's burrow, a set can be one of the pleats in an Elizabethan ruff, and there's one numbered definition in the OED. The OED has 33 different numbered definitions for set. Tiny, little word, 33 numbered definitions. One of them is just labeled \"miscellaneous technical senses.\" Do you know what that says to me? That says to me, it was Friday afternoon and somebody wanted to go down the pub. (Laughter) That's a lexicographical cop out, to say, \"miscellaneous technical senses.\"So, we have all these words, and we really need help! And the thing is, we could ask for help \u2014 asking for help's not that hard. I mean, lexicography is not rocket science. See, I just gave you a lot of words and a lot of numbers, and this is more of a visual explanation. If we think of the dictionary as being the map of the English language, these bright spots are what we know about, and the dark spots are where we are in the dark. If that was the map of all the words in American English, we don't know very much. And we don't even know the shape of the language. If this was the dictionary \u2014 if this was the map of American English \u2014 look, we have a kind of lumpy idea of Florida, but there's no California! We're missing California from American English. We just don't know enough, and we don't even know that we're missing California. We don't even see that there's a gap on the map.So again, lexicography is not rocket science. But even if it were, rocket science is being done by dedicated amateurs these days. You know? It can't be that hard to find some words! So, enough scientists in other disciplines are really asking people to help, and they're doing a good job of it. For instance, there's eBird, where amateur birdwatchers can upload information about their bird sightings. And then, ornithologists can go and help track populations, migrations, etc.And there's this guy, Mike Oates. Mike Oates lives in the U.K. He's a director of an electroplating company. He's found more than 140 comets. He's found so many comets, they named a comet after him. It's kind of out past Mars. It's a hike. I don't think he's getting his picture taken there anytime soon. But he found 140 comets without a telescope. He downloaded data from the NASA SOHO satellite, and that's how he found them. If we can find comets without a telescope, shouldn't we be able to find words?Now, y'all know where I'm going with this. Because I'm going to the Internet, which is where everybody goes. And the Internet is great for collecting words, because the Internet's full of collectors. And this is a little-known technological fact about the Internet, but the Internet is actually made up of words and enthusiasm. And words and enthusiasm actually happen to be the recipe for lexicography. Isn't that great? So there are a lot of really good word-collecting sites out there right now, but the problem with some of them is that they're not scientific enough. They show the word, but they don't show any context. Where did it come from? Who said it? What newspaper was it in? What book?Because a word is like an archaeological artifact. If you don't know the provenance or the source of the artifact, it's not science, it's a pretty thing to look at. So a word without its source is like a cut flower. You know, it's pretty to look at for a while, but then it dies. It dies too fast. So, this whole time I've been saying, \"The dictionary, the dictionary, the dictionary, the dictionary.\" Not \"a dictionary,\" or \"dictionaries.\" And that's because, well, people use the dictionary to stand for the whole language. They use it synecdochically. And one of the problems of knowing a word like \"synecdochically\" is that you really want an excuse to say \"synecdochically.\" This whole talk has just been an excuse to get me to the point where I could say \"synecdochically\" to all of you. So I'm really sorry. But when you use a part of something \u2014 like the dictionary is a part of the language, or a flag stands for the United States, it's a symbol of the country \u2014 then you're using it synecdochically. But the thing is, we could make the dictionary the whole language. If we get a bigger pan, then we can put all the words in. We can put in all the meanings. Doesn't everyone want more meaning in their lives? And we can make the dictionary not just be a symbol of the language \u2014 we can make it be the whole language.You see, what I'm really hoping for is that my son, who turns seven this month \u2014 I want him to barely remember that this is the form factor that dictionaries used to come in. This is what dictionaries used to look like. I want him to think of this kind of dictionary as an eight-track tape. It's a format that died because it wasn't useful enough. It wasn't really what people needed. And the thing is, if we can put in all the words, no longer have that artificial distinction between good and bad, we can really describe the language like scientists. We can leave the aesthetic judgments to the writers and the speakers. If we can do that, then I can spend all my time fishing, and I don't have to be a traffic cop anymore. Thank you very much for your kind attention.", "id": 161, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:11.958 --> 00:00:15.958\nNow, have any of y'all ever looked up this word?\n\n00:00:15.958 --> 00:00:19.958\nYou know, in a dictionary? (Laughter) Yeah, that's what I thought.\n\n00:00:19.958 --> 00:00:21.958\nHow about this word?\n\n00:00:21.958 --> 00:00:22.958\nHere, I'll show it to you.\n\n00:00:22.958 --> 00:00:25.958\nLexicography: the practice of compiling dictionaries.\n\n00:00:25.958 --> 00:00:28.958\nNotice -- we're very specific -- that word \"compile.\"\n\n00:00:28.958 --> 00:00:31.958\nThe dictionary is not carved out of a piece of granite,\n\n00:00:31.958 --> 00:00:34.958\nout of a lump of rock. It's made up of lots of little bits.\n\n00:00:34.958 --> 00:00:35.958\nIt's little discrete --\n\n00:00:35.958 --> 00:00:39.958\nthat's spelled D-I-S-C-R-E-T-E -- bits.\n\n00:00:39.958 --> 00:00:41.958\nAnd those bits are words.\n\n00:00:41.958 --> 00:00:45.958\nNow one of the perks of being a lexicographer --\n\n00:00:45.958 --> 00:00:48.958\nbesides getting to come to TED -- is that you get to say really fun words,\n\n00:00:48.958 --> 00:00:51.958\nlike lexicographical.\n\n00:00:51.958 --> 00:00:53.958\nLexicographical has this great pattern:\n\n00:00:53.958 --> 00:00:55.958\nit's called a double dactyl. And just by saying double dactyl,\n\n00:00:55.958 --> 00:00:58.958\nI've sent the geek needle all the way into the red. (Laughter) (Applause)\n\n00:00:58.958 --> 00:01:02.958\nBut \"lexicographical\" is the same pattern as \"higgledy-piggledy.\"\n\n00:01:02.958 --> 00:01:04.958\nRight? It's a fun word to say,\n\n00:01:04.958 --> 00:01:07.958\nand I get to say it a lot.\n\n00:01:07.958 --> 00:01:10.958\nNow, one of the non-perks of being a lexicographer\n\n00:01:10.958 --> 00:01:15.958\nis that people don't usually have a kind of warm, fuzzy, snuggly image of the dictionary.\n\n00:01:15.958 --> 00:01:18.958\nRight? Nobody hugs their dictionaries.\n\n00:01:18.958 --> 00:01:25.958\nBut what people really often think about the dictionary is, they think more like this.\n\n00:01:25.958 --> 00:01:28.958\nJust to let you know, I do not have a lexicographical whistle.\n\n00:01:28.958 --> 00:01:30.958\nBut people think that my job is to let the good words\n\n00:01:30.958 --> 00:01:33.958\nmake that difficult left-hand turn into the dictionary,\n\n00:01:33.958 --> 00:01:35.958\nand keep the bad words out.\n\n00:01:35.958 --> 00:01:38.958\nBut the thing is, I don't want to be a traffic cop.\n\n00:01:38.958 --> 00:01:42.958\nFor one thing, I just do not do uniforms.\n\n00:01:42.958 --> 00:01:46.958\nAnd for another, deciding what words are good\n\n00:01:46.958 --> 00:01:48.958\nand what words are bad is actually not very easy.\n\n00:01:48.958 --> 00:01:52.958\nAnd it's not very fun. And when parts of your job are not easy or fun,\n\n00:01:52.958 --> 00:01:55.958\nyou kind of look for an excuse not to do them.\n\n00:01:55.958 --> 00:02:00.958\nSo if I had to think of some kind of occupation\n\n00:02:00.958 --> 00:02:06.958\nas a metaphor for my work, I would much rather be a fisherman.\n\n00:02:06.958 --> 00:02:09.958\nI want to throw my big net into the deep, blue ocean of English\n\n00:02:09.958 --> 00:02:13.958\nand see what marvelous creatures I can drag up from the bottom.\n\n00:02:13.958 --> 00:02:18.958\nBut why do people want me to direct traffic, when I would much rather go fishing?\n\n00:02:18.958 --> 00:02:20.958\nWell, I blame the Queen.\n\n00:02:20.958 --> 00:02:22.958\nWhy do I blame the Queen?\n\n00:02:22.958 --> 00:02:24.958\nWell, first of all, I blame the Queen because it's funny.\n\n00:02:24.958 --> 00:02:27.958\nBut secondly, I blame the Queen because\n\n00:02:27.958 --> 00:02:29.958\ndictionaries have really not changed.\n\n00:02:29.958 --> 00:02:31.958\nOur idea of what a dictionary is has not changed since her reign.\n\n00:02:31.958 --> 00:02:37.958\nThe only thing that Queen Victoria would not be amused by in modern dictionaries\n\n00:02:37.958 --> 00:02:40.958\nis our inclusion of the F-word, which has happened\n\n00:02:40.958 --> 00:02:42.958\nin American dictionaries since 1965.\n\n00:02:42.958 --> 00:02:45.958\nSo, there's this guy, right? Victorian era.\n\n00:02:45.958 --> 00:02:47.958\nJames Murray, first editor of the Oxford English Dictionary.\n\n00:02:47.958 --> 00:02:50.958\nI do not have that hat. I wish I had that hat.\n\n00:02:50.958 --> 00:02:54.958\nSo he's really responsible for a lot of\n\n00:02:54.958 --> 00:02:56.958\nwhat we consider modern in dictionaries today.\n\n00:02:56.958 --> 00:02:59.958\nWhen a guy who looks like that, in that hat,\n\n00:02:59.958 --> 00:03:06.958\nis the face of modernity, you have a problem.\n\n00:03:06.958 --> 00:03:08.958\nAnd so, James Murray could get a job on any dictionary today.\n\n00:03:08.958 --> 00:03:11.958\nThere'd be virtually no learning curve.\n\n00:03:11.958 --> 00:03:13.958\nAnd of course, a few of us are saying: okay, computers!\n\n00:03:13.958 --> 00:03:15.958\nComputers! What about computers?\n\n00:03:15.958 --> 00:03:17.958\nThe thing about computers is, I love computers.\n\n00:03:17.958 --> 00:03:19.958\nI mean, I'm a huge geek, I love computers.\n\n00:03:19.958 --> 00:03:23.958\nI would go on a hunger strike before I let them take away Google Book Search from me.\n\n00:03:23.958 --> 00:03:25.958\nBut computers don't do much else other than\n\n00:03:25.958 --> 00:03:29.958\nspeed up the process of compiling dictionaries.\n\n00:03:29.958 --> 00:03:33.958\nThey don't change the end result.\n\n00:03:33.958 --> 00:03:36.958\nBecause what a dictionary is,\n\n00:03:36.958 --> 00:03:39.958\nis it's Victorian design merged with a little bit of modern propulsion.\n\n00:03:39.958 --> 00:03:45.958\nIt's steampunk. What we have is an electric velocipede.\n\n00:03:45.958 --> 00:03:48.958\nYou know, we have Victorian design with an engine on it. That's all!\n\n00:03:48.958 --> 00:03:51.958\nThe design has not changed.\n\n00:03:51.958 --> 00:03:53.958\nAnd OK, what about online dictionaries, right?\n\n00:03:53.958 --> 00:03:56.958\nOnline dictionaries must be different.\n\n00:03:56.958 --> 00:03:58.958\nThis is the Oxford English Dictionary Online, one of the best online dictionaries.\n\n00:03:58.958 --> 00:03:59.958\nThis is my favorite word, by the way.\n\n00:03:59.958 --> 00:04:04.958\nErinaceous: pertaining to the hedgehog family; of the nature of a hedgehog.\n\n00:04:04.958 --> 00:04:10.958\nVery useful word. So, look at that.\n\n00:04:10.958 --> 00:04:12.958\nOnline dictionaries right now are paper thrown up on a screen.\n\n00:04:12.958 --> 00:04:17.958\nThis is flat. Look how many links there are in the actual entry: two!\n\n00:04:17.958 --> 00:04:19.958\nRight? Those little buttons,\n\n00:04:19.958 --> 00:04:22.958\nI had them all expanded except for the date chart.\n\n00:04:22.958 --> 00:04:24.958\nSo there's not very much going on here.\n\n00:04:24.958 --> 00:04:26.958\nThere's not a lot of clickiness.\n\n00:04:26.958 --> 00:04:29.958\nAnd in fact, online dictionaries replicate\n\n00:04:29.958 --> 00:04:32.958\nalmost all the problems of print, except for searchability.\n\n00:04:32.958 --> 00:04:34.958\nAnd when you improve searchability,\n\n00:04:34.958 --> 00:04:37.958\nyou actually take away the one advantage of print, which is serendipity.\n\n00:04:37.958 --> 00:04:40.958\nSerendipity is when you find things you weren't looking for,\n\n00:04:40.958 --> 00:04:43.958\nbecause finding what you are looking for is so damned difficult.\n\n00:04:43.958 --> 00:04:52.958\nSo -- (Laughter) (Applause) -- now, when you think about this,\n\n00:04:52.958 --> 00:04:55.958\nwhat we have here is a ham butt problem.\n\n00:04:55.958 --> 00:04:57.958\nDoes everyone know the ham butt problem?\n\n00:04:57.958 --> 00:04:59.958\nWoman's making a ham for a big, family dinner.\n\n00:04:59.958 --> 00:05:01.958\nShe goes to cut the butt off the ham and throw it away,\n\n00:05:01.958 --> 00:05:02.958\nand she looks at this piece of ham and she's like,\n\n00:05:02.958 --> 00:05:04.958\n\"This is a perfectly good piece of ham. Why am I throwing this away?\"\n\n00:05:04.958 --> 00:05:06.958\nShe thought, \"Well, my mom always did this.\"\n\n00:05:06.958 --> 00:05:07.958\nSo she calls up mom, and she says,\n\n00:05:07.958 --> 00:05:09.958\n\"Mom, why'd you cut the butt off the ham, when you're making a ham?\"\n\n00:05:09.958 --> 00:05:12.958\nShe says, \"I don't know, my mom always did it!\"\n\n00:05:12.958 --> 00:05:14.958\nSo they call grandma, and grandma says,\n\n00:05:14.958 --> 00:05:18.958\n\"My pan was too small!\" (Laughter)\n\n00:05:18.958 --> 00:05:22.958\nSo, it's not that we have good words and bad words.\n\n00:05:22.958 --> 00:05:25.958\nWe have a pan that's too small!\n\n00:05:25.958 --> 00:05:27.958\nYou know, that ham butt is delicious! There's no reason to throw it away.\n\n00:05:27.958 --> 00:05:30.958\nThe bad words -- see, when people think about a place\n\n00:05:30.958 --> 00:05:32.958\nand they don't find a place on the map,\n\n00:05:32.958 --> 00:05:34.958\nthey think, \"This map sucks!\"\n\n00:05:34.958 --> 00:05:36.958\nWhen they find a nightspot or a bar, and it's not in the guidebook,\n\n00:05:36.958 --> 00:05:39.958\nthey're like, \"Ooh, this place must be cool! It's not in the guidebook.\"\n\n00:05:39.958 --> 00:05:42.958\nWhen they find a word that's not in the dictionary, they think,\n\n00:05:42.958 --> 00:05:47.958\n\"This must be a bad word.\" Why? It's more likely to be a bad dictionary.\n\n00:05:47.958 --> 00:05:52.958\nWhy are you blaming the ham for being too big for the pan?\n\n00:05:52.958 --> 00:05:55.958\nSo, you can't get a smaller ham.\n\n00:05:55.958 --> 00:05:58.958\nThe English language is as big as it is.\n\n00:05:58.958 --> 00:06:00.958\nSo, if you have a ham butt problem,\n\n00:06:00.958 --> 00:06:02.958\nand you're thinking about the ham butt problem,\n\n00:06:02.958 --> 00:06:07.958\nthe conclusion that it leads you to is inexorable and counterintuitive:\n\n00:06:07.958 --> 00:06:10.958\npaper is the enemy of words.\n\n00:06:10.958 --> 00:06:14.958\nHow can this be? I mean, I love books. I really love books.\n\n00:06:14.958 --> 00:06:16.958\nSome of my best friends are books.\n\n00:06:16.958 --> 00:06:21.958\nBut the book is not the best shape for the dictionary.\n\n00:06:21.958 --> 00:06:23.958\nNow they're going to think \"Oh, boy.\n\n00:06:23.958 --> 00:06:26.958\nPeople are going to take away my beautiful, paper dictionaries?\"\n\n00:06:26.958 --> 00:06:28.958\nNo. There will still be paper dictionaries.\n\n00:06:28.958 --> 00:06:32.958\nWhen we had cars -- when cars became the dominant mode of transportation,\n\n00:06:32.958 --> 00:06:35.958\nwe didn't round up all the horses and shoot them.\n\n00:06:35.958 --> 00:06:37.958\nYou know, there're still going to be paper dictionaries,\n\n00:06:37.958 --> 00:06:40.958\nbut it's not going to be the dominant dictionary.\n\n00:06:40.958 --> 00:06:43.958\nThe book-shaped dictionary is not going to be the only shape\n\n00:06:43.958 --> 00:06:45.958\ndictionaries come in. And it's not going to be\n\n00:06:45.958 --> 00:06:49.958\nthe prototype for the shapes dictionaries come in.\n\n00:06:49.958 --> 00:06:53.958\nSo, think about it this way: if you've got an artificial constraint,\n\n00:06:53.958 --> 00:06:57.958\nartificial constraints lead to\n\n00:06:57.958 --> 00:07:01.958\narbitrary distinctions and a skewed worldview.\n\n00:07:01.958 --> 00:07:04.958\nWhat if biologists could only study animals\n\n00:07:04.958 --> 00:07:06.958\nthat made people go, \"Aww.\" Right?\n\n00:07:06.958 --> 00:07:08.958\nWhat if we made aesthetic judgments about animals,\n\n00:07:08.958 --> 00:07:13.958\nand only the ones we thought were cute were the ones that we could study?\n\n00:07:13.958 --> 00:07:17.958\nWe'd know a whole lot about charismatic megafauna,\n\n00:07:17.958 --> 00:07:19.958\nand not very much about much else.\n\n00:07:19.958 --> 00:07:21.958\nAnd I think this is a problem.\n\n00:07:21.958 --> 00:07:23.958\nI think we should study all the words,\n\n00:07:23.958 --> 00:07:28.958\nbecause when you think about words, you can make beautiful expressions\n\n00:07:28.958 --> 00:07:32.958\nfrom very humble parts.\n\n00:07:32.958 --> 00:07:36.958\nLexicography is really more about material science.\n\n00:07:36.958 --> 00:07:39.958\nWe are studying the tolerances of the materials\n\n00:07:39.958 --> 00:07:42.958\nthat you use to build the structure of your expression:\n\n00:07:42.958 --> 00:07:49.958\nyour speeches and your writing. And then, often people say to me,\n\n00:07:49.958 --> 00:07:54.958\n\"Well, OK, how do I know that this word is real?\"\n\n00:07:54.958 --> 00:08:01.958\nThey think, \"OK, if we think words are the tools\n\n00:08:01.958 --> 00:08:03.958\nthat we use to build the expressions of our thoughts,\n\n00:08:03.958 --> 00:08:06.958\nhow can you say that screwdrivers are better than hammers?\n\n00:08:06.958 --> 00:08:09.958\nHow can you say that a sledgehammer is better than a ball-peen hammer?\"\n\n00:08:09.958 --> 00:08:12.958\nThey're just the right tools for the job.\n\n00:08:12.958 --> 00:08:15.958\nAnd so people say to me, \"How do I know if a word is real?\"\n\n00:08:15.958 --> 00:08:18.958\nYou know, anybody who's read a children's book\n\n00:08:18.958 --> 00:08:22.958\nknows that love makes things real.\n\n00:08:22.958 --> 00:08:27.958\nIf you love a word, use it. That makes it real.\n\n00:08:27.958 --> 00:08:30.958\nBeing in the dictionary is an artificial distinction.\n\n00:08:30.958 --> 00:08:33.958\nIt doesn't make a word any more real than any other way.\n\n00:08:33.958 --> 00:08:37.958\nIf you love a word, it becomes real.\n\n00:08:37.958 --> 00:08:40.958\nSo if we're not worrying about directing traffic,\n\n00:08:40.958 --> 00:08:45.958\nif we've transcended paper, if we are worrying less\n\n00:08:45.958 --> 00:08:49.958\nabout control and more about description,\n\n00:08:49.958 --> 00:08:51.958\nthen we can think of the English language\n\n00:08:51.958 --> 00:08:54.958\nas being this beautiful mobile.\n\n00:08:54.958 --> 00:08:56.958\nAnd any time one of those little parts of the mobile changes,\n\n00:08:56.958 --> 00:08:59.958\nis touched, any time you touch a word,\n\n00:08:59.958 --> 00:09:01.958\nyou use it in a new context, you give it a new connotation,\n\n00:09:01.958 --> 00:09:04.958\nyou verb it, you make the mobile move.\n\n00:09:04.958 --> 00:09:08.958\nYou didn't break it. It's just in a new position,\n\n00:09:08.958 --> 00:09:11.958\nand that new position can be just as beautiful.\n\n00:09:11.958 --> 00:09:15.958\nNow, if you're no longer a traffic cop --\n\n00:09:15.958 --> 00:09:17.958\nthe problem with being a traffic cop is\n\n00:09:17.958 --> 00:09:20.958\nthere can only be so many traffic cops in any one intersection,\n\n00:09:20.958 --> 00:09:23.958\nor the cars get confused. Right?\n\n00:09:23.958 --> 00:09:26.958\nBut if your goal is no longer to direct the traffic,\n\n00:09:26.958 --> 00:09:30.958\nbut maybe to count the cars that go by, then more eyeballs are better.\n\n00:09:30.958 --> 00:09:32.958\nYou can ask for help!\n\n00:09:32.958 --> 00:09:36.958\nIf you ask for help, you get more done. And we really need help.\n\n00:09:36.958 --> 00:09:39.958\nLibrary of Congress: 17 million books,\n\n00:09:39.958 --> 00:09:42.958\nof which half are in English.\n\n00:09:42.958 --> 00:09:46.958\nIf only one out of every 10 of those books\n\n00:09:46.958 --> 00:09:48.958\nhad a word that's not in the dictionary in it,\n\n00:09:48.958 --> 00:09:51.958\nthat would be equivalent to more than two unabridged dictionaries.\n\n00:09:51.958 --> 00:09:54.958\nAnd I find an un-dictionaried word --\n\n00:09:54.958 --> 00:09:56.958\na word like \"un-dictionaried,\" for example --\n\n00:09:56.958 --> 00:10:01.958\nin almost every book I read. What about newspapers?\n\n00:10:01.958 --> 00:10:06.958\nNewspaper archive goes back to 1759,\n\n00:10:06.958 --> 00:10:11.958\n58.1 million newspaper pages. If only one in 100\n\n00:10:11.958 --> 00:10:14.958\nof those pages had an un-dictionaried word on it,\n\n00:10:14.958 --> 00:10:17.958\nit would be an entire other OED.\n\n00:10:17.958 --> 00:10:22.958\nThat's 500,000 more words. So that's a lot.\n\n00:10:22.958 --> 00:10:25.958\nAnd I'm not even talking about magazines. I'm not talking about blogs --\n\n00:10:25.958 --> 00:10:27.958\nand I find more new words on BoingBoing in a given week\n\n00:10:27.958 --> 00:10:29.958\nthan I do Newsweek or Time.\n\n00:10:29.958 --> 00:10:31.958\nThere's a lot going on there.\n\n00:10:31.958 --> 00:10:33.958\nAnd I'm not even talking about polysemy,\n\n00:10:33.958 --> 00:10:36.958\nwhich is the greedy habit some words have of taking\n\n00:10:36.958 --> 00:10:41.958\nmore than one meaning for themselves.\n\n00:10:41.958 --> 00:10:45.958\nSo if you think of the word \"set,\" a set can be a badger's burrow,\n\n00:10:45.958 --> 00:10:48.958\na set can be one of the pleats in an Elizabethan ruff,\n\n00:10:48.958 --> 00:10:50.958\nand there's one numbered definition in the OED.\n\n00:10:50.958 --> 00:10:53.958\nThe OED has 33 different numbered definitions for set.\n\n00:10:53.958 --> 00:10:56.958\nTiny, little word, 33 numbered definitions.\n\n00:10:56.958 --> 00:11:01.958\nOne of them is just labeled \"miscellaneous technical senses.\"\n\n00:11:01.958 --> 00:11:02.958\nDo you know what that says to me?\n\n00:11:02.958 --> 00:11:07.958\nThat says to me, it was Friday afternoon and somebody wanted to go down the pub. (Laughter)\n\n00:11:07.958 --> 00:11:09.958\nThat's a lexicographical cop out,\n\n00:11:09.958 --> 00:11:11.958\nto say, \"miscellaneous technical senses.\"\n\n00:11:11.958 --> 00:11:15.958\nSo, we have all these words, and we really need help!\n\n00:11:15.958 --> 00:11:18.958\nAnd the thing is, we could ask for help --\n\n00:11:18.958 --> 00:11:19.958\nasking for help's not that hard.\n\n00:11:19.958 --> 00:11:22.958\nI mean, lexicography is not rocket science.\n\n00:11:22.958 --> 00:11:25.958\nSee, I just gave you a lot of words and a lot of numbers,\n\n00:11:25.958 --> 00:11:27.958\nand this is more of a visual explanation.\n\n00:11:27.958 --> 00:11:30.958\nIf we think of the dictionary as being the map of the English language,\n\n00:11:30.958 --> 00:11:32.958\nthese bright spots are what we know about,\n\n00:11:32.958 --> 00:11:35.958\nand the dark spots are where we are in the dark.\n\n00:11:35.958 --> 00:11:40.958\nIf that was the map of all the words in American English, we don't know very much.\n\n00:11:40.958 --> 00:11:43.958\nAnd we don't even know the shape of the language.\n\n00:11:43.958 --> 00:11:46.958\nIf this was the dictionary -- if this was the map of American English --\n\n00:11:46.958 --> 00:11:49.958\nlook, we have a kind of lumpy idea of Florida,\n\n00:11:49.958 --> 00:11:52.958\nbut there's no California!\n\n00:11:52.958 --> 00:11:55.958\nWe're missing California from American English.\n\n00:11:55.958 --> 00:12:00.958\nWe just don't know enough, and we don't even know that we're missing California.\n\n00:12:00.958 --> 00:12:02.958\nWe don't even see that there's a gap on the map.\n\n00:12:02.958 --> 00:12:05.958\nSo again, lexicography is not rocket science.\n\n00:12:05.958 --> 00:12:08.958\nBut even if it were, rocket science is being done\n\n00:12:08.958 --> 00:12:12.958\nby dedicated amateurs these days. You know?\n\n00:12:12.958 --> 00:12:16.958\nIt can't be that hard to find some words!\n\n00:12:16.958 --> 00:12:19.958\nSo, enough scientists in other disciplines\n\n00:12:19.958 --> 00:12:22.958\nare really asking people to help, and they're doing a good job of it.\n\n00:12:22.958 --> 00:12:24.958\nFor instance, there's eBird, where amateur birdwatchers\n\n00:12:24.958 --> 00:12:26.958\ncan upload information about their bird sightings.\n\n00:12:26.958 --> 00:12:28.958\nAnd then, ornithologists can go\n\n00:12:28.958 --> 00:12:31.958\nand help track populations, migrations, etc.\n\n00:12:31.958 --> 00:12:34.958\nAnd there's this guy, Mike Oates. Mike Oates lives in the U.K.\n\n00:12:34.958 --> 00:12:38.958\nHe's a director of an electroplating company.\n\n00:12:38.958 --> 00:12:41.958\nHe's found more than 140 comets.\n\n00:12:41.958 --> 00:12:44.958\nHe's found so many comets, they named a comet after him.\n\n00:12:44.958 --> 00:12:45.958\nIt's kind of out past Mars. It's a hike.\n\n00:12:45.958 --> 00:12:47.958\nI don't think he's getting his picture taken there anytime soon.\n\n00:12:47.958 --> 00:12:51.958\nBut he found 140 comets without a telescope.\n\n00:12:51.958 --> 00:12:54.958\nHe downloaded data from the NASA SOHO satellite,\n\n00:12:54.958 --> 00:12:56.958\nand that's how he found them.\n\n00:12:56.958 --> 00:13:00.958\nIf we can find comets without a telescope,\n\n00:13:00.958 --> 00:13:02.958\nshouldn't we be able to find words?\n\n00:13:02.958 --> 00:13:04.958\nNow, y'all know where I'm going with this.\n\n00:13:04.958 --> 00:13:07.958\nBecause I'm going to the Internet, which is where everybody goes.\n\n00:13:07.958 --> 00:13:09.958\nAnd the Internet is great for collecting words,\n\n00:13:09.958 --> 00:13:10.958\nbecause the Internet's full of collectors.\n\n00:13:10.958 --> 00:13:13.958\nAnd this is a little-known technological fact about the Internet,\n\n00:13:13.958 --> 00:13:16.958\nbut the Internet is actually made up of words and enthusiasm.\n\n00:13:16.958 --> 00:13:21.958\nAnd words and enthusiasm actually happen to be\n\n00:13:21.958 --> 00:13:24.958\nthe recipe for lexicography. Isn't that great?\n\n00:13:24.958 --> 00:13:28.958\nSo there are a lot of really good word-collecting sites out there right now,\n\n00:13:28.958 --> 00:13:30.958\nbut the problem with some of them is that they're not scientific enough.\n\n00:13:30.958 --> 00:13:33.958\nThey show the word, but they don't show any context.\n\n00:13:33.958 --> 00:13:35.958\nWhere did it come from? Who said it?\n\n00:13:35.958 --> 00:13:37.958\nWhat newspaper was it in? What book?\n\n00:13:37.958 --> 00:13:41.958\nBecause a word is like an archaeological artifact.\n\n00:13:41.958 --> 00:13:44.958\nIf you don't know the provenance or the source of the artifact,\n\n00:13:44.958 --> 00:13:47.958\nit's not science, it's a pretty thing to look at.\n\n00:13:47.958 --> 00:13:50.958\nSo a word without its source is like a cut flower.\n\n00:13:50.958 --> 00:13:54.958\nYou know, it's pretty to look at for a while, but then it dies.\n\n00:13:54.958 --> 00:13:55.958\nIt dies too fast.\n\n00:13:55.958 --> 00:13:59.958\nSo, this whole time I've been saying,\n\n00:13:59.958 --> 00:14:01.958\n\"The dictionary, the dictionary, the dictionary, the dictionary.\"\n\n00:14:01.958 --> 00:14:04.958\nNot \"a dictionary,\" or \"dictionaries.\" And that's because,\n\n00:14:04.958 --> 00:14:07.958\nwell, people use the dictionary to stand for the whole language.\n\n00:14:07.958 --> 00:14:10.958\nThey use it synecdochically.\n\n00:14:10.958 --> 00:14:13.958\nAnd one of the problems of knowing a word like \"synecdochically\"\n\n00:14:13.958 --> 00:14:16.958\nis that you really want an excuse to say \"synecdochically.\"\n\n00:14:16.958 --> 00:14:18.958\nThis whole talk has just been an excuse to get me to the point\n\n00:14:18.958 --> 00:14:20.958\nwhere I could say \"synecdochically\" to all of you.\n\n00:14:20.958 --> 00:14:23.958\nSo I'm really sorry. But when you use a part of something --\n\n00:14:23.958 --> 00:14:25.958\nlike the dictionary is a part of the language,\n\n00:14:25.958 --> 00:14:30.958\nor a flag stands for the United States, it's a symbol of the country --\n\n00:14:30.958 --> 00:14:34.958\nthen you're using it synecdochically.\n\n00:14:34.958 --> 00:14:38.958\nBut the thing is, we could make the dictionary the whole language.\n\n00:14:38.958 --> 00:14:42.958\nIf we get a bigger pan, then we can put all the words in.\n\n00:14:42.958 --> 00:14:46.958\nWe can put in all the meanings.\n\n00:14:46.958 --> 00:14:50.958\nDoesn't everyone want more meaning in their lives?\n\n00:14:50.958 --> 00:14:54.958\nAnd we can make the dictionary not just be a symbol of the language --\n\n00:14:54.958 --> 00:14:57.958\nwe can make it be the whole language.\n\n00:14:57.958 --> 00:14:59.958\nYou see, what I'm really hoping for is that my son,\n\n00:14:59.958 --> 00:15:02.958\nwho turns seven this month -- I want him to barely remember\n\n00:15:02.958 --> 00:15:07.958\nthat this is the form factor that dictionaries used to come in.\n\n00:15:07.958 --> 00:15:09.958\nThis is what dictionaries used to look like.\n\n00:15:09.958 --> 00:15:11.958\nI want him to think of this kind of dictionary as an eight-track tape.\n\n00:15:11.958 --> 00:15:15.958\nIt's a format that died because it wasn't useful enough.\n\n00:15:15.958 --> 00:15:18.958\nIt wasn't really what people needed.\n\n00:15:18.958 --> 00:15:21.958\nAnd the thing is, if we can put in all the words,\n\n00:15:21.958 --> 00:15:25.958\nno longer have that artificial distinction between good and bad,\n\n00:15:25.958 --> 00:15:28.958\nwe can really describe the language like scientists.\n\n00:15:28.958 --> 00:15:30.958\nWe can leave the aesthetic judgments to the writers and the speakers.\n\n00:15:30.958 --> 00:15:34.958\nIf we can do that, then I can spend all my time fishing,\n\n00:15:34.958 --> 00:15:39.958\nand I don't have to be a traffic cop anymore.\n\n00:15:39.958 --> 00:15:41.958\nThank you very much for your kind attention."}, {"title": "Aid for Africa?

I am very happy and honored to be amidst very, very innovative and intelligent people. I have listened to the three previous speakers, and guess what happened?

So, I will \u2014 since I am not young and am very old, I still will say something.We are hosting this conference at a very opportune moment, because another conference is taking place in Berlin. It is the G8 Summit. The G8 Summit proposes that the solution to Africa's problems should be a massive increase in aid, something akin to the Marshall Plan. Unfortunately, I personally do not believe in the Marshall Plan. One, because the benefits of the Marshall Plan have been overstated. Its largest recipients were Germany and France, and it was only 2.5 percent of their GDP. An average African country receives foreign aid to the tune of 13, 15 percent of its GDP, and that is an unprecedented transfer of financial resources from rich countries to poor countries.But I want to say that there are two things we need to connect. How the media covers Africa in the West, and the consequences of that. By displaying despair, helplessness and hopelessness, the media is telling the truth about Africa, and nothing but the truth. However, the media is not telling us the whole truth. Because despair, civil war, hunger and famine, although they're part and parcel of our African reality, they are not the only reality. And secondly, they are the smallest reality.Africa has 53 nations. We have civil wars only in six countries, which means that the media are covering only six countries. Africa has immense opportunities that never navigate through the web of despair and helplessness that the Western media largely presents to its audience. But the effect of that presentation is, it appeals to sympathy. It appeals to pity. It appeals to something called charity. And, as a consequence, the Western view of Africa's economic dilemma is framed wrongly. The wrong framing is a product of thinking that Africa is a place of despair. What should we do with it? We should give food to the hungry. We should deliver medicines to those who are ill. We should send peacekeeping troops to serve those who are facing a civil war. And in the process, Africa has been stripped of self-initiative.I want to say that it is important to recognize that Africa has fundamental weaknesses. But equally, it has opportunities and a lot of potential. We need to reframe the challenge that is facing Africa, from a challenge of despair, which is called poverty reduction, to a challenge of hope. We frame it as a challenge of hope, and that is worth creation. The challenge facing all those who are interested in Africa is not the challenge of reducing poverty. It should be a challenge of creating wealth.Once we change those two things \u2014 if you say the Africans are poor and they need poverty reduction, you have the international cartel of good intentions moving onto the continent, with what? Medicines for the poor, food relief for those who are hungry, and peacekeepers for those who are facing civil war. And in the process, none of these things really are productive because you are treating the symptoms, not the causes of Africa's fundamental problems. Sending somebody to school and giving them medicines, ladies and gentlemen, does not create wealth for them. Wealth is a function of income, and income comes from you finding a profitable trading opportunity or a well-paying job.Now, once we begin to talk about wealth creation in Africa, our second challenge will be, who are the wealth-creating agents in any society? They are entrepreneurs. [Unclear] told us they are always about four percent of the population, but 16 percent are imitators. But they also succeed at the job of entrepreneurship. So, where should we be putting the money? We need to put money where it can productively grow. Support private investment in Africa, both domestic and foreign. Support research institutions, because knowledge is an important part of wealth creation.But what is the international aid community doing with Africa today? They are throwing large sums of money for primary health, for primary education, for food relief. The entire continent has been turned into a place of despair, in need of charity. Ladies and gentlemen, can any one of you tell me a neighbor, a friend, a relative that you know, who became rich by receiving charity? By holding the begging bowl and receiving alms? Does any one of you in the audience have that person? Does any one of you know a country that developed because of the generosity and kindness of another? Well, since I'm not seeing the hand, it appears that what I'm stating is true.(Bono: Yes!)Andrew Mwenda: I can see Bono says he knows the country. Which country is that?(Bono: It's an Irish land.)(Laughter)(Bono: [unclear])AM: Thank you very much. But let me tell you this. External actors can only present to you an opportunity. The ability to utilize that opportunity and turn it into an advantage depends on your internal capacity. Africa has received many opportunities. Many of them we haven't benefited much. Why? Because we lack the internal, institutional framework and policy framework that can make it possible for us to benefit from our external relations. I'll give you an example.Under the Cotonou Agreement, formerly known as the Lome Convention, African countries have been given an opportunity by Europe to export goods, duty-free, to the European Union market. My own country, Uganda, has a quota to export 50,000 metric tons of sugar to the European Union market. We haven't exported one kilogram yet. We import 50,000 metric tons of sugar from Brazil and Cuba. Secondly, under the beef protocol of that agreement, African countries that produce beef have quotas to export beef duty-free to the European Union market. None of those countries, including Africa's most successful nation, Botswana, has ever met its quota.So, I want to argue today that the fundamental source of Africa's inability to engage the rest of the world in a more productive relationship is because it has a poor institutional and policy framework. And all forms of intervention need support, the evolution of the kinds of institutions that create wealth, the kinds of institutions that increase productivity. How do we begin to do that, and why is aid the bad instrument? Aid is the bad instrument, and do you know why? Because all governments across the world need money to survive. Money is needed for a simple thing like keeping law and order. You have to pay the army and the police to show law and order. And because many of our governments are quite dictatorial, they need really to have the army clobber the opposition. The second thing you need to do is pay your political hangers-on. Why should people support their government? Well, because it gives them good, paying jobs, or, in many African countries, unofficial opportunities to profit from corruption.The fact is no government in the world, with the exception of a few, like that of Idi Amin, can seek to depend entirely on force as an instrument of rule. Many countries in the [unclear], they need legitimacy. To get legitimacy, governments often need to deliver things like primary education, primary health, roads, build hospitals and clinics. If the government's fiscal survival depends on it having to raise money from its own people, such a government is driven by self-interest to govern in a more enlightened fashion. It will sit with those who create wealth. Talk to them about the kind of policies and institutions that are necessary for them to expand a scale and scope of business so that it can collect more tax revenues from them. The problem with the African continent and the problem with the aid industry is that it has distorted the structure of incentives facing the governments in Africa. The productive margin in our governments' search for revenue does not lie in the domestic economy, it lies with international donors.Rather than sit with Ugandan \u2014(Applause) \u2014rather than sit with Ugandan entrepreneurs, Ghanaian businessmen, South African enterprising leaders, our governments find it more productive to talk to the IMF and the World Bank. I can tell you, even if you have ten Ph.Ds., you can never beat Bill Gates in understanding the computer industry. Why? Because the knowledge that is required for you to understand the incentives necessary to expand a business \u2014 it requires that you listen to the people, the private sector actors in that industry.Governments in Africa have therefore been given an opportunity, by the international community, to avoid building productive arrangements with your own citizens, and therefore allowed to begin endless negotiations with the IMF and the World Bank, and then it is the IMF and the World Bank that tell them what its citizens need. In the process, we, the African people, have been sidelined from the policy-making, policy-orientation, and policy- implementation process in our countries. We have limited input, because he who pays the piper calls the tune. The IMF, the World Bank, and the cartel of good intentions in the world has taken over our rights as citizens, and therefore what our governments are doing, because they depend on aid, is to listen to international creditors rather than their own citizens.But I want to put a caveat on my argument, and that caveat is that it is not true that aid is always destructive. Some aid may have built a hospital, fed a hungry village. It may have built a road, and that road may have served a very good role. The mistake of the international aid industry is to pick these isolated incidents of success, generalize them, pour billions and trillions of dollars into them, and then spread them across the whole world, ignoring the specific and unique circumstances in a given village, the skills, the practices, the norms and habits that allowed that small aid project to succeed \u2014 like in Sauri village, in Kenya, where Jeffrey Sachs is working \u2014 and therefore generalize this experience as the experience of everybody.Aid increases the resources available to governments, and that makes working in a government the most profitable thing you can have, as a person in Africa seeking a career. By increasing the political attractiveness of the state, especially in our ethnically fragmented societies in Africa, aid tends to accentuate ethnic tensions as every single ethnic group now begins struggling to enter the state in order to get access to the foreign aid pie. Ladies and gentlemen, the most enterprising people in Africa cannot find opportunities to trade and to work in the private sector because the institutional and policy environment is hostile to business. Governments are not changing it. Why? Because they don't need to talk to their own citizens. They talk to international donors. So, the most enterprising Africans end up going to work for government, and that has increased the political tensions in our countries precisely because we depend on aid.I also want to say that it is important for us to note that, over the last 50 years, Africa has been receiving increasing aid from the international community, in the form of technical assistance, and financial aid, and all other forms of aid. Between 1960 and 2003, our continent received 600 billion dollars of aid, and we are still told that there is a lot of poverty in Africa. Where has all the aid gone?I want to use the example of my own country, called Uganda, and the kind of structure of incentives that aid has brought there. In the 2006-2007 budget, expected revenue: 2.5 trillion shillings. The expected foreign aid: 1.9 trillion. Uganda's recurrent expenditure \u2014 by recurrent what do I mean? Hand-to-mouth is 2.6 trillion. Why does the government of Uganda budget spend 110 percent of its own revenue? It's because there's somebody there called foreign aid, who contributes for it. But this shows you that the government of Uganda is not committed to spending its own revenue to invest in productive investments, but rather it devotes this revenue to paying structure of public expenditure. Public administration, which is largely patronage, takes 690 billion. The military, 380 billion. Agriculture, which employs 18 percent of our poverty-stricken citizens, takes only 18 billion. Trade and industry takes 43 billion. And let me show you, what does public expenditure \u2014 rather, public administration expenditure \u2014 in Uganda constitute? There you go. 70 cabinet ministers, 114 presidential advisers, by the way, who never see the president, except on television.(Laughter)(Applause)And when they see him physically, it is at public functions like this, and even there, it is him who advises them.(Laughter)We have 81 units of local government. Each local government is organized like the central government \u2014 a bureaucracy, a cabinet, a parliament, and so many jobs for the political hangers-on. There were 56, and when our president wanted to amend the constitution and remove term limits, he had to create 25 new districts, and now there are 81. Three hundred thirty-three members of parliament. You need Wembley Stadium to host our parliament. One hundred thirty-four commissions and semi-autonomous government bodies, all of which have directors and the cars. And the final thing, this is addressed to Mr. Bono. In his work, he may help us on this.A recent government of Uganda study found that there are 3,000 four-wheel drive motor vehicles at the Minister of Health headquarters. Uganda has 961 sub-counties, each of them with a dispensary, none of which has an ambulance. So, the four-wheel drive vehicles at the headquarters drive the ministers, the permanent secretaries, the bureaucrats and the international aid bureaucrats who work in aid projects, while the poor die without ambulances and medicine.Finally, I want to say that before I came to speak here, I was told that the principle of TEDGlobal is that the good speech should be like a miniskirt. It should be short enough to arouse interest, but long enough to cover the subject. I hope I have achieved that.(Laughter)Thank you very much.(Applause)", "id": 159, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:12.958 --> 00:00:16.958\nI am very, very happy to be amidst some of the most --\n\n00:00:16.958 --> 00:00:18.958\nthe lights are really disturbing my eyes\n\n00:00:18.958 --> 00:00:20.958\nand they're reflecting on my glasses.\n\n00:00:20.958 --> 00:00:24.958\nI am very happy and honored to be amidst\n\n00:00:24.958 --> 00:00:27.958\nvery, very innovative and intelligent people.\n\n00:00:27.958 --> 00:00:30.958\nI have listened to the three previous speakers,\n\n00:00:30.958 --> 00:00:32.958\nand guess what happened?\n\n00:00:32.958 --> 00:00:35.958\nEvery single thing I planned to say, they have said it here,\n\n00:00:35.958 --> 00:00:40.958\nand it looks and sounds like I have nothing else to say.\n\n00:00:40.958 --> 00:00:41.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:00:41.958 --> 00:00:44.958\nBut there is a saying in my culture\n\n00:00:44.958 --> 00:00:49.958\nthat if a bud leaves a tree without saying something,\n\n00:00:49.958 --> 00:00:52.958\nthat bud is a young one.\n\n00:00:52.958 --> 00:00:57.958\nSo, I will -- since I am not young and am very old,\n\n00:00:57.958 --> 00:00:59.958\nI still will say something.\n\n00:00:59.958 --> 00:01:04.958\nWe are hosting this conference at a very opportune moment,\n\n00:01:04.958 --> 00:01:06.958\nbecause another conference is taking place in Berlin.\n\n00:01:06.958 --> 00:01:09.958\nIt is the G8 Summit.\n\n00:01:09.958 --> 00:01:16.958\nThe G8 Summit proposes that the solution to Africa's problems\n\n00:01:16.958 --> 00:01:19.958\nshould be a massive increase in aid,\n\n00:01:19.958 --> 00:01:21.958\nsomething akin to the Marshall Plan.\n\n00:01:21.958 --> 00:01:25.958\nUnfortunately, I personally do not believe in the Marshall Plan.\n\n00:01:25.958 --> 00:01:30.958\nOne, because the benefits of the Marshall Plan have been overstated.\n\n00:01:30.958 --> 00:01:33.958\nIts largest recipients were Germany and France,\n\n00:01:33.958 --> 00:01:36.958\nand it was only 2.5 percent of their GDP.\n\n00:01:36.958 --> 00:01:39.958\nAn average African country receives foreign aid\n\n00:01:39.958 --> 00:01:45.958\nto the tune of 13, 15 percent of its GDP,\n\n00:01:45.958 --> 00:01:48.958\nand that is an unprecedented transfer of financial resources\n\n00:01:48.958 --> 00:01:51.958\nfrom rich countries to poor countries.\n\n00:01:51.958 --> 00:01:54.958\nBut I want to say that there are two things we need to connect.\n\n00:01:54.958 --> 00:02:00.958\nHow the media covers Africa in the West, and the consequences of that.\n\n00:02:00.958 --> 00:02:03.958\nBy displaying despair, helplessness and hopelessness,\n\n00:02:03.958 --> 00:02:09.958\nthe media is telling the truth about Africa, and nothing but the truth.\n\n00:02:09.958 --> 00:02:13.958\nHowever, the media is not telling us the whole truth.\n\n00:02:13.958 --> 00:02:17.958\nBecause despair, civil war, hunger and famine,\n\n00:02:17.958 --> 00:02:21.958\nalthough they're part and parcel of our African reality,\n\n00:02:21.958 --> 00:02:23.958\nthey are not the only reality.\n\n00:02:23.958 --> 00:02:25.958\nAnd secondly, they are the smallest reality.\n\n00:02:25.958 --> 00:02:27.958\nAfrica has 53 nations.\n\n00:02:27.958 --> 00:02:30.958\nWe have civil wars only in six countries,\n\n00:02:30.958 --> 00:02:34.958\nwhich means that the media are covering only six countries.\n\n00:02:34.958 --> 00:02:38.958\nAfrica has immense opportunities that never navigate\n\n00:02:38.958 --> 00:02:40.958\nthrough the web of despair and helplessness\n\n00:02:40.958 --> 00:02:45.958\nthat the Western media largely presents to its audience.\n\n00:02:45.958 --> 00:02:49.958\nBut the effect of that presentation is, it appeals to sympathy.\n\n00:02:49.958 --> 00:02:54.958\nIt appeals to pity.

00:07:09.958\nMy own country, Uganda, has a quota to export 50,000 metric tons\n\n00:07:09.958 --> 00:07:12.958\nof sugar to the European Union market.\n\n00:07:12.958 --> 00:07:14.958\nWe haven't exported one kilogram yet.\n\n00:07:14.958 --> 00:07:23.958\nWe import 50,000 metric tons of sugar from Brazil and Cuba.\n\n00:07:23.958 --> 00:07:26.958\nSecondly, under the beef protocol of that agreement,\n\n00:07:26.958 --> 00:07:28.958\nAfrican countries that produce beef\n\n00:07:28.958 --> 00:07:33.958\nhave quotas to export beef duty-free to the European Union market.\n\n00:07:33.958 --> 00:07:37.958\nNone of those countries, including Africa's most successful nation, Botswana,\n\n00:07:37.958 --> 00:07:40.958\nhas ever met its quota.\n\n00:07:40.958 --> 00:07:45.958\nSo, I want to argue today that the fundamental source of Africa's\n\n00:07:45.958 --> 00:07:47.958\ninability to engage the rest of the world\n\n00:07:47.958 --> 00:07:50.958\nin a more productive relationship\n\n00:07:50.958 --> 00:07:54.958\nis because it has a poor institutional and policy framework.\n\n00:07:54.958 --> 00:07:57.958\nAnd all forms of intervention need support,\n\n00:07:57.958 --> 00:08:01.958\nthe evolution of the kinds of institutions that create wealth,\n\n00:08:01.958 --> 00:08:04.958\nthe kinds of institutions that increase productivity.\n\n00:08:04.958 --> 00:08:08.958\nHow do we begin to do that, and why is aid the bad instrument?\n\n00:08:08.958 --> 00:08:10.958\nAid is the bad instrument, and do you know why?\n\n00:08:10.958 --> 00:08:14.958\nBecause all governments across the world need money to survive.\n\n00:08:14.958 --> 00:08:18.958\nMoney is needed for a simple thing like keeping law and order.\n\n00:08:18.958 --> 00:08:20.958\nYou have to pay the army and the police to show law and order.\n\n00:08:20.958 --> 00:08:24.958\nAnd because many of our governments are quite dictatorial,\n\n00:08:24.958 --> 00:08:28.958\nthey need really to have the army clobber the opposition.\n\n00:08:28.958 --> 00:08:33.958\nThe second thing you need to do is pay your political hangers-on.\n\n00:08:33.958 --> 00:08:34.958\nWhy should people support their government?\n\n00:08:34.958 --> 00:08:36.958\nWell, because it gives them good, paying jobs,\n\n00:08:36.958 --> 00:08:40.958\nor, in many African countries, unofficial opportunities\n\n00:08:40.958 --> 00:08:42.958\nto profit from corruption.\n\n00:08:42.958 --> 00:08:45.958\nThe fact is no government in the world,\n\n00:08:45.958 --> 00:08:47.958\nwith the exception of a few, like that of Idi Amin,\n\n00:08:47.958 --> 00:08:52.958\ncan seek to depend entirely on force as an instrument of rule.\n\n00:08:52.958 --> 00:08:55.958\nMany countries in the [unclear], they need legitimacy.\n\n00:08:55.958 --> 00:09:01.958\nTo get legitimacy, governments often need to deliver things like primary education,\n\n00:09:01.958 --> 00:09:06.958\nprimary health, roads, build hospitals and clinics.\n\n00:09:06.958 --> 00:09:08.958\nIf the government's fiscal survival\n\n00:09:08.958 --> 00:09:12.958\ndepends on it having to raise money from its own people,\n\n00:09:12.958 --> 00:09:14.958\nsuch a government is driven by self-interest\n\n00:09:14.958 --> 00:09:16.958\nto govern in a more enlightened fashion.\n\n00:09:16.958 --> 00:09:19.958\nIt will sit with those who create wealth.\n\n00:09:19.958 --> 00:09:22.958\nTalk to them about the kind of policies and institutions\n\n00:09:22.958 --> 00:09:26.958\nthat are necessary for them to expand a scale and scope of business\n\n00:09:26.958 --> 00:09:29.958\nso that it can collect more tax revenues from them.\n\n00:09:29.958 --> 00:09:31.958\nThe problem with the African continent\n\n00:09:31.958 --> 00:09:32.958\nand the problem with the aid industry\n\n00:09:32.958 --> 00:09:35.958\nis that it has distorted the structure of incentives\n\n00:09:35.958 --> 00:09:38.958\nfacing the governments in Africa.\n\n00:09:38.958 --> 00:09:41.958\nThe productive margin in our governments' search for revenue\n\n00:09:41.958 --> 00:09:44.958\ndoes not lie in the domestic economy,\n\n00:09:44.958 --> 00:09:46.958\nit lies with international donors.\n\n00:09:46.958 --> 00:09:48.958\nRather than sit with Ugandan --\n\n00:09:48.958 --> 00:09:52.958\n(Applause) --\n\n00:09:52.958 --> 00:09:55.958\nrather than sit with Ugandan entrepreneurs,\n\n00:09:55.958 --> 00:10:01.958\nGhanaian businessmen, South African enterprising leaders,\n\n00:10:01.958 --> 00:10:04.958\nour governments find it more productive\n\n00:10:04.958 --> 00:10:07.958\nto talk to the IMF and the World Bank.\n\n00:10:07.958 --> 00:10:11.958\nI can tell you, even if you have ten Ph.Ds.,\n\n00:10:11.958 --> 00:10:16.958\nyou can never beat Bill Gates in understanding the computer industry.\n\n00:10:16.958 --> 00:10:20.958\nWhy? Because the knowledge that is required for you to understand\n\n00:10:20.958 --> 00:10:22.958\nthe incentives necessary to expand a business --\n\n00:10:22.958 --> 00:10:28.958\nit requires that you listen to the people, the private sector actors in that industry.\n\n00:10:28.958 --> 00:10:31.958\nGovernments in Africa have therefore been given an opportunity,\n\n00:10:31.958 --> 00:10:34.958\nby the international community, to avoid building\n\n00:10:34.958 --> 00:10:36.958\nproductive arrangements with your own citizens,\n\n00:10:36.958 --> 00:10:42.958\nand therefore allowed to begin endless negotiations with the IMF\n\n00:10:42.958 --> 00:10:45.958\nand the World Bank, and then it is the IMF and the World Bank\n\n00:10:45.958 --> 00:10:47.958\nthat tell them what its citizens need.\n\n00:10:47.958 --> 00:10:51.958\nIn the process, we, the African people, have been sidelined\n\n00:10:51.958 --> 00:10:55.958\nfrom the policy-making, policy-orientation, and policy-\n\n00:10:55.958 --> 00:10:57.958\nimplementation process in our countries.\n\n00:10:57.958 --> 00:11:01.958\nWe have limited input, because he who pays the piper calls the tune.\n\n00:11:01.958 --> 00:11:05.958\nThe IMF, the World Bank, and the cartel of good intentions in the world\n\n00:11:05.958 --> 00:11:08.958\nhas taken over our rights as citizens,\n\n00:11:08.958 --> 00:11:11.958\nand therefore what our governments are doing, because they depend on aid,\n\n00:11:11.958 --> 00:11:15.958\nis to listen to international creditors rather than their own citizens.\n\n00:11:15.958 --> 00:11:17.958\nBut I want to put a caveat on my argument,\n\n00:11:17.958 --> 00:11:25.958\nand that caveat is that it is not true that aid is always destructive.\n\n00:11:25.958 --> 00:11:32.958\nSome aid may have built a hospital, fed a hungry village.\n\n00:11:32.958 --> 00:11:34.958\nIt may have built a road, and that road\n\n00:11:34.958 --> 00:11:36.958\nmay have served a very good role.\n\n00:11:36.958 --> 00:11:38.958\nThe mistake of the international aid industry\n\n00:11:38.958 --> 00:11:42.958\nis to pick these isolated incidents of success,\n\n00:11:42.958 --> 00:11:47.958\ngeneralize them, pour billions and trillions of dollars into them,\n\n00:11:47.958 --> 00:11:49.958\nand then spread them across the whole world,\n\n00:11:49.958 --> 00:11:54.958\nignoring the specific and unique circumstances in a given village,\n\n00:11:54.958 --> 00:11:57.958\nthe skills, the practices, the norms and habits\n\n00:11:57.958 --> 00:12:00.958\nthat allowed that small aid project to succeed --\n\n00:12:00.958 --> 00:12:03.958\nlike in Sauri village, in Kenya, where Jeffrey Sachs is working --\n\n00:12:03.958 --> 00:12:06.958\nand therefore generalize this experience\n\n00:12:06.958 --> 00:12:09.958\nas the experience of everybody.\n\n00:12:09.958 --> 00:12:14.958\nAid increases the resources available to governments,\n\n00:12:14.958 --> 00:12:18.958\nand that makes working in a government the most profitable thing\n\n00:12:18.958 --> 00:12:21.958\nyou can have, as a person in Africa seeking a career.\n\n00:12:21.958 --> 00:12:25.958\nBy increasing the political attractiveness of the state,\n\n00:12:25.958 --> 00:12:29.958\nespecially in our ethnically fragmented societies in Africa,\n\n00:12:29.958 --> 00:12:32.958\naid tends to accentuate ethnic tensions\n\n00:12:32.958 --> 00:12:38.958\nas every single ethnic group now begins struggling to enter the state\n\n00:12:38.958 --> 00:12:41.958\nin order to get access to the foreign aid pie.\n\n00:12:41.958 --> 00:12:46.958\nLadies and gentlemen, the most enterprising people in Africa\n\n00:12:46.958 --> 00:12:51.958\ncannot find opportunities to trade and to work in the private sector\n\n00:12:51.958 --> 00:12:54.958\nbecause the institutional and policy environment is hostile to business.\n\n00:12:54.958 --> 00:12:56.958\nGovernments are not changing it. Why?\n\n00:12:56.958 --> 00:13:01.958\nBecause they don't need to talk to their own citizens.\n\n00:13:01.958 --> 00:13:03.958\nThey talk to international donors.\n\n00:13:03.958 --> 00:13:08.958\nSo, the most enterprising Africans end up going to work for government,\n\n00:13:08.958 --> 00:13:11.958\nand that has increased the political tensions in our countries\n\n00:13:11.958 --> 00:13:14.958\nprecisely because we depend on aid.\n\n00:13:14.958 --> 00:13:18.958\nI also want to say that it is important for us to\n\n00:13:18.958 --> 00:13:22.958\nnote that, over the last 50 years, Africa has been receiving increasing aid\n\n00:13:22.958 --> 00:13:24.958\nfrom the international community,\n\n00:13:24.958 --> 00:13:27.958\nin the form of technical assistance, and financial aid,\n\n00:13:27.958 --> 00:13:29.958\nand all other forms of aid.\n\n00:13:29.958 --> 00:13:39.958\nBetween 1960 and 2003, our continent received 600 billion dollars of aid,\n\n00:13:39.958 --> 00:13:42.958\nand we are still told that there is a lot of poverty in Africa.\n\n00:13:42.958 --> 00:13:45.958\nWhere has all the aid gone?\n\n00:13:45.958 --> 00:13:49.958\nI want to use the example of my own country, called Uganda,\n\n00:13:49.958 --> 00:13:54.958\nand the kind of structure of incentives that aid has brought there.\n\n00:13:54.958 --> 00:14:00.958\nIn the 2006-2007 budget, expected revenue: 2.5 trillion shillings.\n\n00:14:00.958 --> 00:14:03.958\nThe expected foreign aid: 1.9 trillion.\n\n00:14:03.958 --> 00:14:07.958\nUganda's recurrent expenditure -- by recurrent what do I mean?\n\n00:14:07.958 --> 00:14:11.958\nHand-to-mouth is 2.6 trillion.\n\n00:14:11.958 --> 00:14:16.958\nWhy does the government of Uganda budget spend 110 percent\n\n00:14:16.958 --> 00:14:17.958\nof its own revenue?\n\n00:14:17.958 --> 00:14:22.958\nIt's because there's somebody there called foreign aid, who contributes for it.\n\n00:14:22.958 --> 00:14:24.958\nBut this shows you that the government of Uganda\n\n00:14:24.958 --> 00:14:28.958\nis not committed to spending its own revenue\n\n00:14:28.958 --> 00:14:30.958\nto invest in productive investments,\n\n00:14:30.958 --> 00:14:32.958\nbut rather it devotes this revenue\n\n00:14:32.958 --> 00:14:36.958\nto paying structure of public expenditure.\n\n00:14:36.958 --> 00:14:41.958\nPublic administration, which is largely patronage, takes 690 billion.\n\n00:14:41.958 --> 00:14:43.958\nThe military, 380 billion.\n\n00:14:43.958 --> 00:14:48.958\nAgriculture, which employs 18 percent of our poverty-stricken citizens,\n\n00:14:48.958 --> 00:14:51.958\ntakes only 18 billion.\n\n00:14:51.958 --> 00:14:55.958\nTrade and industry takes 43 billion.\n\n00:14:55.958 --> 00:14:59.958\nAnd let me show you, what does public expenditure --\n\n00:14:59.958 --> 00:15:03.958\nrather, public administration expenditure -- in Uganda constitute?\n\n00:15:03.958 --> 00:15:09.958\nThere you go. 70 cabinet ministers, 114 presidential advisers,\n\n00:15:09.958 --> 00:15:12.958\nby the way, who never see the president, except on television.\n\n00:15:12.958 --> 00:15:15.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:15:15.958 --> 00:15:20.958\n(Applause)\n\n00:15:20.958 --> 00:15:25.958\nAnd when they see him physically, it is at public functions like this,\n\n00:15:25.958 --> 00:15:29.958\nand even there, it is him who advises them.\n\n00:15:29.958 --> 00:15:31.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:15:31.958 --> 00:15:34.958\nWe have 81 units of local government.\n\n00:15:34.958 --> 00:15:36.958\nEach local government is organized like the central government --\n\n00:15:36.958 --> 00:15:38.958\na bureaucracy, a cabinet, a parliament,\n\n00:15:38.958 --> 00:15:41.958\nand so many jobs for the political hangers-on.\n\n00:15:41.958 --> 00:15:44.958\nThere were 56, and when our president wanted to\n\n00:15:44.958 --> 00:15:47.958\namend the constitution and remove term limits,\n\n00:15:47.958 --> 00:15:51.958\nhe had to create 25 new districts, and now there are 81.\n\n00:15:51.958 --> 00:15:53.958\nThree hundred thirty-three members of parliament.\n\n00:15:53.958 --> 00:15:55.958\nYou need Wembley Stadium to host our parliament.\n\n00:15:55.958 --> 00:15:57.958\nOne hundred thirty-four commissions\n\n00:15:57.958 --> 00:16:02.958\nand semi-autonomous government bodies,\n\n00:16:02.958 --> 00:16:06.958\nall of which have directors and the cars. And the final thing,\n\n00:16:06.958 --> 00:16:10.958\nthis is addressed to Mr. Bono. In his work, he may help us on this.\n\n00:16:10.958 --> 00:16:12.958\nA recent government of Uganda study found\n\n00:16:12.958 --> 00:16:16.958\nthat there are 3,000 four-wheel drive motor vehicles\n\n00:16:16.958 --> 00:16:18.958\nat the Minister of Health headquarters.\n\n00:16:18.958 --> 00:16:23.958\nUganda has 961 sub-counties, each of them with a dispensary,\n\n00:16:23.958 --> 00:16:25.958\nnone of which has an ambulance.\n\n00:16:25.958 --> 00:16:28.958\nSo, the four-wheel drive vehicles at the headquarters\n\n00:16:28.958 --> 00:16:31.958\ndrive the ministers, the permanent secretaries, the bureaucrats\n\n00:16:31.958 --> 00:16:34.958\nand the international aid bureaucrats who work in aid projects,\n\n00:16:34.958 --> 00:16:40.958\nwhile the poor die without ambulances and medicine.\n\n00:16:40.958 --> 00:16:44.958\nFinally, I want to say that before I came to speak here,\n\n00:16:44.958 --> 00:16:48.958\nI was told that the principle of TEDGlobal\n\n00:16:48.958 --> 00:16:51.958\nis that the good speech should be like a miniskirt.\n\n00:16:51.958 --> 00:16:53.958\nIt should be short enough to arouse interest,\n\n00:16:53.958 --> 00:16:55.958\nbut long enough to cover the subject.\n\n00:16:55.958 --> 00:16:56.958\nI hope I have achieved that.\n\n00:16:56.958 --> 00:16:57.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:16:57.958 --> 00:16:58.958\nThank you very much.\n\n00:16:58.958 --> 00:17:00.958\n(Applause)"}]

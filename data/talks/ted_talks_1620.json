[{"title": "Adventures in Twitter fiction", "duration": "715", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/andrew_fitzgerald_adventures_in_twitter_fiction", "transcript": "So in my free time outside of Twitter I experiment a little bit with telling stories online, experimenting with what we can do with new digital tools. And in my job at Twitter, I actually spent a little bit of time working with authors and storytellers as well, helping to expand out the bounds of what people are experimenting with. And I want to talk through some examples today of things that people have done that I think are really fascinating using flexible identity and anonymity on the web and blurring the lines between fact and fiction.But I want to start and go back to the 1930s. Long before a little thing called Twitter, radio brought us broadcasts and connected millions of people to single points of broadcast. And from those single points emanated stories. Some of them were familiar stories. Some of them were new stories. And for a while they were familiar formats, but then radio began to evolve its own unique formats specific to that medium. Think about episodes that happened live on radio.Combining the live play and the serialization of written fiction, you get this new format. And the reason why I bring up radio is that I think radio is a great example of how a new medium defines new formats which then define new stories.And of course, today, we have an entirely new medium to play with, which is this online world. This is the map of verified users on Twitter and the connections between them. There are thousands upon thousands of them. Every single one of these points is its own broadcaster. We've gone to this world of many to many, where access to the tools is the only barrier to broadcasting. And I think that we should start to see wildly new formats emerge as people learn how to tell stories in this new medium. I actually believe that we are in a wide open frontier for creative experimentation, if you will, that we've explored and begun to settle this wild land of the Internet and are now just getting ready to start to build structures on it, and those structures are the new formats of storytelling that the Internet will allow us to create.I believe this starts with an evolution of existing methods. The short story, for example, people are saying that the short story is experiencing a renaissance of sorts thanks to e-readers, digital marketplaces. One writer, Hugh Howey, experimented with short stories on Amazon by releasing one very short story called \"Wool.\" And he actually says that he didn't intend for \"Wool\" to become a series, but that the audience loved the first story so much they demanded more, and so he gave them more. He gave them \"Wool 2,\" which was a little bit longer than the first one, \"Wool 3,\" which was even longer, culminating in \"Wool 5,\" which was a 60,000-word novel. I think Howey was able to do all of this because he had the quick feedback system of e-books. He was able to write and publish in relatively short order. There was no mediator between him and the audience. It was just him directly connected with his audience and building on the feedback and enthusiasm that they were giving him. So this whole project was an experiment. It started with the one short story, and I think the experimentation actually became a part of Howey's format. And that's something that this medium enabled, was experimentation being a part of the format itself.This is a short story by the author Jennifer Egan called \"Black Box.\" It was originally written specifically with Twitter in mind. Egan convinced The New Yorker to start a New Yorker fiction account from which they could tweet all of these lines that she created. Now Twitter, of course, has a 140-character limit. Egan mocked that up just writing manually in this storyboard sketchbook, used the physical space constraints of those storyboard squares to write each individual tweet, and those tweets ended up becoming over 600 of them that were serialized by The New Yorker. Every night, at 8 p.m., you could tune in to a short story from The New Yorker's fiction account. I think that's pretty exciting: tune-in literary fiction. The experience of Egan's story, of course, like anything on Twitter, there were multiple ways to experience it. You could scroll back through it, but interestingly, if you were watching it live, there was this suspense that built because the actual tweets, you had no control over when you would read them. They were coming at a pretty regular clip, but as the story was building, normally, as a reader, you control how fast you move through a text, but in this case, The New Yorker did, and they were sending you bit by bit by bit, and you had this suspense of waiting for the next line.Another great example of fiction and the short story on Twitter, Elliott Holt is an author who wrote a story called \"Evidence.\" It began with this tweet: \"On November 28 at 10:13 p.m., a woman identified as Miranda Brown, 44, of Brooklyn, fell to her death from the roof of a Manhattan hotel.\" It begins in Elliott's voice, but then Elliott's voice recedes, and we hear the voices of Elsa, Margot and Simon, characters that Elliott created on Twitter specifically to tell this story, a story from multiple perspectives leading up to this moment at 10:13 p.m. when this woman falls to her death. These three characters brought an authentic vision from multiple perspectives. One reviewer called Elliott's story \"Twitter fiction done right,\" because she did. She captured that voice and she had multiple characters and it happened in real time. Interestingly, though, it wasn't just Twitter as a distribution mechanism. It was also Twitter as a production mechanism. Elliott told me later she wrote the whole thing with her thumbs. She laid on the couch and just went back and forth between different characters tweeting out each line, line by line. I think that this kind of spontaneous creation of what was coming out of the characters' voices really lent an authenticity to the characters themselves, but also to this format that she had created of multiple perspectives in a single story on Twitter.As you begin to play with flexible identity online, it gets even more interesting as you start to interact with the real world. Things like Invisible Obama or the famous \"binders full of women\" that came up during the 2012 election cycle, or even the fan fiction universe of \"West Wing\" Twitter in which you have all of these accounts for every single one of the characters in \"The West Wing,\" including the bird that taps at Josh Lyman's window in one single episode. (Laughter)All of these are rapid iterations on a theme. They are creative people experimenting with the bounds of what is possible in this medium. You look at something like \"West Wing\" Twitter, in which you have these fictional characters that engage with the real world. They comment on politics, they cry out against the evils of Congress. Keep in mind, they're all Democrats. And they engage with the real world. They respond to it. So once you take flexible identity, anonymity, engagement with the real world, and you move beyond simple homage or parody and you put these tools to work in telling a story, that's when things get really interesting.So during the Chicago mayoral election there was a parody account. It was Mayor Emanuel. It gave you everything you wanted from Rahm Emanuel, particularly in the expletive department. This foul-mouthed account followed the daily activities of the race, providing commentary as it went. It followed all of the natural tropes of a good, solid Twitter parody account, but then started to get weird. And as it progressed, it moved from this commentary to a multi-week, real-time science fiction epic in which your protagonist, Rahm Emanuel, engages in multi-dimensional travel on election day, which is \u2014 it didn't actually happen. I double checked the newspapers.And then, very interestingly, it came to an end. This is something that doesn't usually happen with a Twitter parody account. It ended, a true narrative conclusion. And so the author, Dan Sinker, who was a journalist, who was completely anonymous this whole time, I think Dan \u2014 it made a lot of sense for him to turn this into a book, because it was a narrative format in the end, and I think that turning it into a book is representative of this idea that he had created something new that needed to be translated into previous formats.One of my favorite examples of something that's happening on Twitter right now, actually, is the very absurdist Crimer Show. Crimer Show tells the story of a supercriminal and a hapless detective that face off in this exceptionally strange lingo, with all of the tropes of a television show. Crimer Show's creator has said that it is a parody of a popular type of show in the U.K., but, man, is it weird. And there are all these times where Crimer, the supercriminal, does all of these TV things. He's always taking off his sunglasses or turning to the camera, but these things just happen in text. I think borrowing all of these tropes from television and additionally presenting each Crimer Show as an episode, spelled E-P-P-A-S-O-D, \"eppasod,\" presenting them as episodes really, it creates something new. There is a new \"eppasod\" of Crimer Show on Twitter pretty much every day, and they're archived that way. And I think this is an interesting experiment in format. Something totally new has been created here out of parodying something on television.I think in nonfiction real-time storytelling, there are a lot of really excellent examples as well. RealTimeWWII is an account that documents what was happening on this day 60 years ago in exceptional detail, as if you were reading the news reports from that day. And the author Teju Cole has done a lot of experimentation with putting a literary twist on events of the news. In this particular case, he's talking about drone strikes. I think that in both of these examples, you're beginning to see ways in which people are telling stories with nonfiction content that can be built into new types of fictional storytelling.So with real-time storytelling, blurring the lines between fact and fiction, the real world and the digital world, flexible identity, anonymity, these are all tools that we have accessible to us, and I think that they're just the building blocks. They are the bits that we use to create the structures, the frames, that then become our settlements on this wide open frontier for creative experimentation.Thank you.(Applause)", "id": 1841,

he actually says that he didn't intend\n\n00:02:55.183 --> 00:02:56.528\nfor \"Wool\" to become a series,\n\n00:02:56.528 --> 00:02:59.154\nbut that the audience loved the first story so much\n\n00:02:59.154 --> 00:03:01.565\nthey demanded more, and so he gave them more.\n\n00:03:01.565 --> 00:03:05.069\nHe gave them \"Wool 2,\" which was a little bit longer than the first one,\n\n00:03:05.069 --> 00:03:07.063\n\"Wool 3,\" which was even longer,\n\n00:03:07.063 --> 00:03:08.853\nculminating in \"Wool 5,\"\n\n00:03:08.853 --> 00:03:11.694\nwhich was a 60,000-word novel.\n\n00:03:11.694 --> 00:03:15.679\nI think Howey was able to do all of this because\n\n00:03:15.679 --> 00:03:18.622\nhe had the quick feedback system of e-books.\n\n00:03:18.622 --> 00:03:20.424\nHe was able to write and publish\n\n00:03:20.424 --> 00:03:22.013\nin relatively short order.\n\n00:03:22.013 --> 00:03:25.110\nThere was no mediator between him and the audience.\n\n00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:27.916\nIt was just him directly connected with his audience\n\n00:03:27.916 --> 00:03:30.065\nand building on the feedback and enthusiasm\n\n00:03:30.065 --> 00:03:31.886\nthat they were giving him.\n\n00:03:31.886 --> 00:03:33.771\nSo this whole project was an experiment.\n\n00:03:33.771 --> 00:03:35.878\nIt started with the one short story,\n\n00:03:35.878 --> 00:03:38.007\nand I think the experimentation actually became\n\n00:03:38.007 --> 00:03:40.335\na part of Howey's format.\n\n00:03:40.335 --> 00:03:43.574\nAnd that's something that this medium enabled,\n\n00:03:43.574 --> 00:03:47.751\nwas experimentation being a part of the format itself.\n\n00:03:47.751 --> 00:03:50.922\nThis is a short story by the author Jennifer Egan\n\n00:03:50.922 --> 00:03:52.370\ncalled \"Black Box.\"\n\n00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:53.877\nIt was originally written\n\n00:03:53.877 --> 00:03:55.558\nspecifically with Twitter in mind.\n\n00:03:55.558 --> 00:03:57.867\nEgan convinced The New Yorker\n\n00:03:57.867 --> 00:04:00.289\nto start a New Yorker fiction account\n\n00:04:00.289 --> 00:04:02.106\nfrom which they could tweet\n\n00:04:02.106 --> 00:04:03.910\nall of these lines that she created.\n\n00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:07.357\nNow Twitter, of course, has a 140-character limit.\n\n00:04:07.357 --> 00:04:10.198\nEgan mocked that up just writing manually\n\n00:04:10.198 --> 00:04:13.114\nin this storyboard sketchbook,\n\n00:04:13.114 --> 00:04:16.101\nused the physical space constraints\n\n00:04:16.101 --> 00:04:17.610\nof those storyboard squares\n\n00:04:17.610 --> 00:04:19.411\nto write each individual tweet,\n\n00:04:19.411 --> 00:04:22.350\nand those tweets ended up becoming\n\n00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:26.038\nover 600 of them that were serialized by The New Yorker.\n\n00:04:26.038 --> 00:04:29.808\nEvery night, at 8 p.m., you could tune in\n\n00:04:29.808 --> 00:04:33.376\nto a short story from The New Yorker's fiction account.\n\n00:04:33.376 --> 00:04:34.920\nI think that's pretty exciting:\n\n00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:37.426\ntune-in literary fiction.\n\n00:04:37.426 --> 00:04:40.487\nThe experience of Egan's story, of course,\n\n00:04:40.487 --> 00:04:43.536\nlike anything on Twitter, there were multiple ways to experience it.\n\n00:04:43.536 --> 00:04:45.075\nYou could scroll back through it,\n\n00:04:45.075 --> 00:04:47.958\nbut interestingly, if you were watching it live,\n\n00:04:47.958 --> 00:04:50.589\nthere was this suspense that built\n\n00:04:50.589 --> 00:04:53.106\nbecause the actual tweets,\n\n00:04:53.106 --> 00:04:55.409\nyou had no control over when you would read them.\n\n00:04:55.409 --> 00:04:57.849\nThey were coming at a pretty regular clip,\n\n00:04:57.849 --> 00:05:00.227\nbut as the story was building,\n\n00:05:00.227 --> 00:05:03.470\nnormally, as a reader, you control how fast you move through a text,\n\n00:05:03.470 --> 00:05:05.781\nbut in this case, The New Yorker did,\n\n00:05:05.781 --> 00:05:08.951\nand they were sending you bit by bit by bit,\n\n00:05:08.951 --> 00:05:12.233\nand you had this suspense of waiting for the next line.\n\n00:05:12.233 --> 00:05:15.304\nAnother great example of fiction\n\n00:05:15.304 --> 00:05:17.348\nand the short story on Twitter,\n\n00:05:17.348 --> 00:05:20.771\nElliott Holt is an author who wrote a story called \"Evidence.\"\n\n00:05:20.771 --> 00:05:23.401\nIt began with this tweet: \"On November 28\n\n00:05:23.401 --> 00:05:25.552\nat 10:13 p.m.,\n\n00:05:25.552 --> 00:05:27.627\na woman identified as Miranda Brown,\n\n00:05:27.627 --> 00:05:30.457\n44, of Brooklyn, fell to her death\n\n00:05:30.457 --> 00:05:32.823\nfrom the roof of a Manhattan hotel.\"\n\n00:05:32.823 --> 00:05:34.553\nIt begins in Elliott's voice,\n\n00:05:34.553 --> 00:05:36.294\nbut then Elliott's voice recedes,\n\n00:05:36.294 --> 00:05:39.676\nand we hear the voices of Elsa, Margot and Simon,\n\n00:05:39.676 --> 00:05:42.775\ncharacters that Elliott created on Twitter\n\n00:05:42.775 --> 00:05:44.504\nspecifically to tell this story,\n\n00:05:44.504 --> 00:05:47.118\na story from multiple perspectives\n\n00:05:47.118 --> 00:05:50.243\nleading up to this moment at 10:13 p.m.\n\n00:05:50.243 --> 00:05:52.521\nwhen this woman falls to her death.\n\n00:05:52.521 --> 00:05:55.625\nThese three characters brought an authentic vision\n\n00:05:55.625 --> 00:05:57.347\nfrom multiple perspectives.\n\n00:05:57.347 --> 00:05:59.673\nOne reviewer called Elliott's story\n\n00:05:59.673 --> 00:06:02.563\n\"Twitter fiction done right,\" because she did.\n\n00:06:02.563 --> 00:06:04.291\nShe captured that voice\n\n00:06:04.291 --> 00:06:07.479\nand she had multiple characters and it happened in real time.\n\n00:06:07.479 --> 00:06:10.178\nInterestingly, though, it wasn't just\n\n00:06:10.178 --> 00:06:12.342\nTwitter as a distribution mechanism.\n\n00:06:12.342 --> 00:06:14.486\nIt was also Twitter as a production mechanism.\n\n00:06:14.486 --> 00:06:15.730\nElliott told me later\n\n00:06:15.730 --> 00:06:19.777\nshe wrote the whole thing with her thumbs.\n\n00:06:19.777 --> 00:06:23.580\nShe laid on the couch and just went back and forth\n\n00:06:23.580 --> 00:06:25.429\nbetween different characters\n\n00:06:25.429 --> 00:06:28.042\ntweeting out each line, line by line.\n\n00:06:28.042 --> 00:06:30.795\nI think that this kind of spontaneous creation\n\n00:06:30.795 --> 00:06:33.311\nof what was coming out of the characters' voices\n\n00:06:33.311 --> 00:06:36.420\nreally lent an authenticity to the characters themselves,\n\n00:06:36.420 --> 00:06:39.098\nbut also to this format that she had created\n\n00:06:39.098 --> 00:06:43.711\nof multiple perspectives in a single story on Twitter.\n\n00:06:43.711 --> 00:06:46.438\nAs you begin to play with flexible identity online,\n\n00:06:46.438 --> 00:06:47.735\nit gets even more interesting\n\n00:06:47.735 --> 00:06:49.680\nas you start to interact with the real world.\n\n00:06:49.680 --> 00:06:51.584\nThings like Invisible Obama\n\n00:06:51.584 --> 00:06:53.825\nor the famous \"binders full of women\"\n\n00:06:53.825 --> 00:06:56.371\nthat came up during the 2012 election cycle,\n\n00:06:56.371 --> 00:07:00.542\nor even the fan fiction universe of \"West Wing\" Twitter\n\n00:07:00.542 --> 00:07:02.652\nin which you have all of these accounts\n\n00:07:02.652 --> 00:07:05.628\nfor every single one of the characters in \"The West Wing,\"\n\n00:07:05.628 --> 00:07:09.531\nincluding the bird that taps at Josh Lyman's window\n\n00:07:09.531 --> 00:07:13.667\nin one single episode. (Laughter)\n\n00:07:13.667 --> 00:07:16.803\nAll of these are rapid iterations on a theme.\n\n00:07:16.803 --> 00:07:19.119\nThey are creative people experimenting\n\n00:07:19.119 --> 00:07:22.175\nwith the bounds of what is possible in this medium.\n\n00:07:22.175 --> 00:07:23.928\nYou look at something like \"West Wing\" Twitter,\n\n00:07:23.928 --> 00:07:26.328\nin which you have these fictional characters\n\n00:07:26.328 --> 00:07:28.286\nthat engage with the real world.\n\n00:07:28.286 --> 00:07:30.078\nThey comment on politics,\n\n00:07:30.078 --> 00:07:34.612\nthey cry out against the evils of Congress.\n\n00:07:34.612 --> 00:07:36.396\nKeep in mind, they're all Democrats.\n\n00:07:36.396 --> 00:07:39.716\nAnd they engage with the real world.\n\n00:07:39.716 --> 00:07:41.574\nThey respond to it.\n\n00:07:41.574 --> 00:07:43.719\nSo once you take flexible identity,\n\n00:07:43.719 --> 00:07:46.418\nanonymity, engagement with the real world,\n\n00:07:46.418 --> 00:07:49.589\nand you move beyond simple homage or parody\n\n00:07:49.589 --> 00:07:53.178\nand you put these tools to work in telling a story,\n\n00:07:53.178 --> 00:07:55.061\nthat's when things get really interesting.\n\n00:07:55.061 --> 00:07:57.870\nSo during the Chicago mayoral election\n\n00:07:57.870 --> 00:07:59.438\nthere was a parody account.\n\n00:07:59.438 --> 00:08:00.852\nIt was Mayor Emanuel.\n\n00:08:00.852 --> 00:08:04.318\nIt gave you everything you wanted from Rahm Emanuel,\n\n00:08:04.318 --> 00:08:07.638\nparticularly in the expletive department.\n\n00:08:07.638 --> 00:08:09.717\nThis foul-mouthed account\n\n00:08:09.717 --> 00:08:13.604\nfollowed the daily activities of the race,\n\n00:08:13.604 --> 00:08:15.284\nproviding commentary as it went.\n\n00:08:15.284 --> 00:08:17.765\nIt followed all of the natural tropes\n\n00:08:17.765 --> 00:08:20.147\nof a good, solid Twitter parody account,\n\n00:08:20.147 --> 00:08:23.829\nbut then started to get weird.\n\n00:08:23.829 --> 00:08:27.202\nAnd as it progressed, it moved from this commentary\n\n00:08:27.202 --> 00:08:32.470\nto a multi-week, real-time science fiction epic\n\n00:08:32.470 --> 00:08:35.558\nin which your protagonist, Rahm Emanuel,\n\n00:08:35.558 --> 00:08:39.715\nengages in multi-dimensional travel on election day,\n\n00:08:39.715 --> 00:08:42.328\nwhich is -- it didn't actually happen.\n\n00:08:42.328 --> 00:08:45.746\nI double checked the newspapers.\n\n00:08:45.746 --> 00:08:49.289\nAnd then, very interestingly, it came to an end.\n\n00:08:49.289 --> 00:08:51.288\nThis is something that doesn't usually happen\n\n00:08:51.288 --> 00:08:52.749\nwith a Twitter parody account.\n\n00:08:52.749 --> 00:08:56.478\nIt ended, a true narrative conclusion.\n\n00:08:56.478 --> 00:08:59.700\nAnd so the author, Dan Sinker, who was a journalist,\n\n00:08:59.700 --> 00:09:02.035\nwho was completely anonymous this whole time,\n\n00:09:02.035 --> 00:09:05.733\nI think Dan -- it made a lot of sense for him\n\n00:09:05.733 --> 00:09:07.317\nto turn this into a book,\n\n00:09:07.317 --> 00:09:10.690\nbecause it was a narrative format in the end,\n\n00:09:10.690 --> 00:09:13.251\nand I think that turning it into a book\n\n00:09:13.251 --> 00:09:16.949\nis representative of this idea that he had created something new\n\n00:09:16.949 --> 00:09:20.575\nthat needed to be translated into previous formats.\n\n00:09:20.575 --> 00:09:22.668\nOne of my favorite examples\n\n00:09:22.668 --> 00:09:24.664\nof something that's happening on Twitter right now,\n\n00:09:24.664 --> 00:09:29.440\nactually, is the very absurdist Crimer Show.\n\n00:09:29.440 --> 00:09:31.872\nCrimer Show tells the story\n\n00:09:31.872 --> 00:09:34.613\nof a supercriminal and a hapless detective\n\n00:09:34.613 --> 00:09:38.298\nthat face off in this exceptionally strange lingo,\n\n00:09:38.298 --> 00:09:40.720\nwith all of the tropes of a television show.\n\n00:09:40.720 --> 00:09:42.257\nCrimer Show's creator has said that\n\n00:09:42.257 --> 00:09:47.249\nit is a parody of a popular type of show in the U.K.,\n\n00:09:47.249 --> 00:09:50.107\nbut, man, is it weird.\n\n00:09:50.107 --> 00:09:52.078\nAnd there are all these times where Crimer,\n\n00:09:52.078 --> 00:09:54.507\nthe supercriminal, does all of these TV things.\n\n00:09:54.507 --> 00:09:56.759\nHe's always taking off his sunglasses\n\n00:09:56.759 --> 00:09:59.727\nor turning to the camera,\n\n00:09:59.727 --> 00:10:02.167\nbut these things just happen in text.\n\n00:10:02.167 --> 00:10:05.001\nI think borrowing all of these tropes from television\n\n00:10:05.001 --> 00:10:08.753\nand additionally presenting each Crimer Show\n\n00:10:08.753 --> 00:10:13.986\nas an episode, spelled E-P-P-A-S-O-D, \"eppasod,\"\n\n00:10:13.986 --> 00:10:16.035\npresenting them as episodes\n\n00:10:16.035 --> 00:10:19.065\nreally, it creates something new.\n\n00:10:19.065 --> 00:10:22.654\nThere is a new \"eppasod\" of Crimer Show\n\n00:10:22.654 --> 00:10:24.778\non Twitter pretty much every day,\n\n00:10:24.778 --> 00:10:26.390\nand they're archived that way.\n\n00:10:26.390 --> 00:10:29.171\nAnd I think this is an interesting experiment in format.\n\n00:10:29.171 --> 00:10:31.455\nSomething totally new has been created here\n\n00:10:31.455 --> 00:10:34.991\nout of parodying something on television.\n\n00:10:34.991 --> 00:10:37.831\nI think in nonfiction real-time storytelling,\n\n00:10:37.831 --> 00:10:40.598\nthere are a lot of really excellent examples as well.\n\n00:10:40.598 --> 00:10:42.547\nRealTimeWWII is an account\n\n00:10:42.547 --> 00:10:46.610\nthat documents what was happening on this day 60 years ago\n\n00:10:46.610 --> 00:10:48.979\nin exceptional detail, as if\n\n00:10:48.979 --> 00:10:51.708\nyou were reading the news reports from that day.\n\n00:10:51.708 --> 00:10:53.463\nAnd the author Teju Cole has done\n\n00:10:53.463 --> 00:10:56.874\na lot of experimentation with putting a literary twist\n\n00:10:56.874 --> 00:10:58.502\non events of the news.\n\n00:10:58.502 --> 00:11:02.945\nIn this particular case, he's talking about drone strikes.\n\n00:11:02.945 --> 00:11:05.545\nI think that in both of these examples,\n\n00:11:05.545 --> 00:11:07.186\nyou're beginning to see ways in which\n\n00:11:07.186 --> 00:11:10.010\npeople are telling stories with nonfiction content\n\n00:11:10.010 --> 00:11:12.919\nthat can be built into new types\n\n00:11:12.919 --> 00:11:15.480\nof fictional storytelling.\n\n00:11:15.480 --> 00:11:18.042\nSo with real-time storytelling,\n\n00:11:18.042 --> 00:11:20.571\nblurring the lines between fact and fiction,\n\n00:11:20.571 --> 00:11:22.648\nthe real world and the digital world,\n\n00:11:22.648 --> 00:11:26.430\nflexible identity, anonymity,\n\n00:11:26.430 --> 00:11:29.951\nthese are all tools that we have accessible to us,\n\n00:11:29.951 --> 00:11:31.843\nand I think that they're just the building blocks.\n\n00:11:31.843 --> 00:11:34.481\nThey are the bits that we use\n\n00:11:34.481 --> 00:11:37.118\nto create the structures, the frames,\n\n00:11:37.118 --> 00:11:40.216\nthat then become our settlements on this\n\n00:11:40.216 --> 00:11:42.976\nwide open frontier for creative experimentation.\n\n00:11:42.976 --> 00:11:44.427\nThank you.\n\n00:11:44.427 --> 00:11:49.181\n(Applause)"}, {"title": "The walkable city", "duration": "1016", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/jeff_speck_the_walkable_city", "transcript": "So I'm a city planner, an urban designer, former arts advocate, trained in architecture and art history, and I want to talk to you today not about design but about America and how America can be more economically resilient, how America can be healthier, and how America can be more environmentally sustainable. And I realize this is a global forum, but I think I need to talk about America because there is a history, in some places, not all, of American ideas being appropriated, being emulated, for better or for worse, around the world.And the worst idea we've ever had is suburban sprawl. It's being emulated in many places as we speak. By suburban sprawl, I refer to the reorganization of the landscape and the creation of the landscape around the requirement of automobile use, and that the automobile that was once an instrument of freedom has become a gas-belching, time-wasting and life-threatening prosthetic device that many of us need just to, most Americans, in fact, need, just to live their daily lives. And there's an alternative. You know, we say, half the world is living in cities. Well, in America, that living in cities, for many of them, they're living in cities still where they're dependent on that automobile. And what I work for, and to do, is to make our cities more walkable. But I can't give design arguments for that that will have as much impact as the arguments that I've learned from the economists, the epidemiologists and the environmentalists. So these are the three arguments that I'm going to give you quickly today.When I was growing up in the '70s, the typical American spent one tenth of their income, American family, on transportation. Since then, we've doubled the number of roads in America, and we now spend one fifth of our income on transportation. Working families, which are defined as earning between 20,000 and 50,000 dollars a year in America are spending more now on transportation than on housing, slightly more, because of this phenomenon called \"drive till you qualify,\" finding homes further and further and further from the city centers and from their jobs, so that they're locked in this, two, three hours, four hours a day of commuting. And these are the neighborhoods, for example, in the Central Valley of California that weren't hurt when the housing bubble burst and when the price of gas went up; they were decimated. And in fact, these are many of the half-vacant communities that you see today. Imagine putting everything you have into your mortgage, it goes underwater, and you have to pay twice as much for all the driving that you're doing.So we know what it's done to our society and all the extra work we have to do to support our cars. What happens when a city decides it's going to set other priorities? And probably the best example we have here in America is Portland, Oregon. Portland made a bunch of decisions in the 1970s that began to distinguish it from almost every other American city. While most other cities were growing an undifferentiated spare tire of sprawl, they instituted an urban growth boundary. While most cities were reaming out their roads, removing parallel parking and trees in order to flow more traffic, they instituted a skinny streets program. And while most cities were investing in more roads and more highways, they actually invested in bicycling and in walking. And they spent 60 million dollars on bike facilities, which seems like a lot of money, but it was spent over about 30 years, so two million dollars a year \u2014 not that much \u2014 and half the price of the one cloverleaf that they decided to rebuild in that city. These changes and others like them changed the way that Portlanders live, and their vehicle-miles traveled per day, the amount that each person drives, actually peaked in 1996, has been dropping ever since, and they now drive 20 percent less than the rest of the country. The typical Portland citizen drives four miles less, and 11 minutes less per day than they did before. The economist Joe Cortright did the math and he found out that those four miles plus those 11 minutes adds up to fully three and a half percent of all income earned in the region.So if they're not spending that money on driving \u2014 and by the way, 85 percent of the money we spend on driving leaves the local economy \u2014 if they're not spending that money on driving, what are they spending it on? Well, Portland is reputed to have the most roof racks per capita, the most independent bookstores per capita, the most strip clubs per capita. These are all exaggerations, slight exaggerations of a fundamental truth, which is Portlanders spend a lot more on recreation of all kinds than the rest of America. Actually, Oregonians spend more on alcohol than most other states, which may be a good thing or a bad thing, but it makes you glad they're driving less.(Laughter)But actually, they're spending most of it in their homes, and home investment is about as local an investment as you can get. But there's a whole other Portland story, which isn't part of this calculus, which is that young, educated people have been moving to Portland in droves, so that between the last two censuses, they had a 50-percent increase in college-educated millennials, which is five times what you saw anywhere else in the country, or, I should say, of the national average.So on the one hand, a city saves money for its residents by being more walkable and more bikeable, but on the other hand, it also is the cool kind of city that people want to be in these days. So the best economic strategy you can have as a city is not the old way of trying to attract corporations and trying to have a biotech cluster or a medical cluster, or an aerospace cluster, but to become a place where people want to be. And millennials, certainly, these engines of entrepreneurship, 64 percent of whom decide first where they want to live, then they move there, then they look for a job, they will come to your city.The health argument is a scary one, and you've probably heard part of this argument before. Again, back in the '70s, a lot's changed since then, back in the '70s, one in 10 Americans was obese. Now one out of three Americans is obese, and a second third of the population is overweight. Twenty-five percent of young men and 40 percent of young women are too heavy to enlist in our own military forces. According to the Center for Disease Control, fully one third of all children born after 2000 will get diabetes. We have the first generation of children in America who are predicted to live shorter lives than their parents.I believe that this American healthcare crisis that we've all heard about is an urban design crisis, and that the design of our cities lies at the cure. Because we've talked a long time about diet, and we know that diet impacts weight, and weight of course impacts health. But we've only started talking about inactivity, and how inactivity born of our landscape, inactivity that comes from the fact that we live in a place where there is no longer any such thing as a useful walk, is driving our weight up. And we finally have the studies, one in Britain called \"Gluttony versus sloth\" that tracked weight against diet and tracked weight against inactivity, and found a much higher, stronger correlation between the latter two. Dr. James Levine at, in this case, the aptly-named Mayo Clinic put his test subjects in electronic underwear, held their diet steady, and then started pumping the calories in. Some people gained weight, some people didn't gain weight. Expecting some metabolic or DNA factor at work, they were shocked to learn that the only difference between the subjects that they could figure out was the amount they were moving, and that in fact those who gained weight were sitting, on average, two hours more per day than those who didn't.So we have these studies that tie weight to inactivity, but even more, we now have studies that tie weight to where you live. Do you live in a more walkable city or do you live in a less walkable city, or where in your city do you live? In San Diego, they used Walk Score \u2014 Walk Score rates every address in America and soon the world in terms of how walkable it is \u2014 they used Walk Score to designate more walkable neighborhoods and less walkable neighborhoods. Well guess what? If you lived in a more walkable neighborhood, you were 35 percent likely to be overweight. If you lived in a less walkable neighborhood, you were 60 percent likely to be overweight. So we have study after study now that's tying where you live to your health, particularly as in America, the biggest health crisis we have is this one that's stemming from environmental-induced inactivity. And I learned a new word last week. They call these neighborhoods \"obesageneric.\" I may have that wrong, but you get the idea.Now that's one thing, of course. Briefly mentioning, we have an asthma epidemic in this country. You probably haven't thought that much about it. Fourteen Americans die each day from asthma, three times what it was in the '90s, and it's almost all coming from car exhaust. American pollution does not come from factories anymore, it comes from tailpipes, and the amount that people are driving in your city, your urban VMT, is a good prediction of the asthma problems in your city.And then finally, in terms of driving, there's the issue of the single-largest killer of healthy adults, and one of the largest killers of all people, is car crashes. And we take car crashes for granted. We figure it's a natural risk of being on the road. But in fact, here in America, 12 people out of every 100,000 die every year from car crashes. We're pretty safe here. Well, guess what? In England, it's seven per 100,000. It's Japan, it's four per 100,000. Do you know where it's three per 100,000? New York City. San Francisco, the same thing. Portland, the same thing. Oh, so cities make us safer because we're driving less? Tulsa: 14 per 100,000. Orlando: 20 per 100,000. It's not whether you're in the city or not, it's how is your city designed? Was it designed around cars or around people? Because if your city is designed around cars, it's really good at smashing them into each other.That's part of a much larger health argument.Finally, the environmental argument is fascinating, because the environmentalists turned on a dime about 10 years ago. The environmental movement in America has historically been an anti-city movement from Jefferson on.\"Cities are pestilential to the health, to the liberties, to the morals of man. If we continue to pile upon ourselves in cities, as they do in Europe, we shall become as corrupt as they are in Europe and take to eating one another as they do there.\"He apparently had a sense of humor.And then the American environmental movement has been a classically Arcadian movement. To become more environmental, we move into the country, we commune with nature, we build suburbs. But, of course, we've seen what that does.The carbon mapping of America, where is the CO2 being emitted, for many years only hammered this argument in more strongly. If you look at any carbon map, because we map it per square mile, any carbon map of the U.S., it looks like a night sky satellite photo of the U.S., hottest in the cities, cooler in the suburbs, dark, peaceful in the countryside. Until some economists said, you know, is that the right way to measure CO2? There are only so many people in this country at any given time, and we can choose to live where perhaps we would have a lighter impact. And they said, let's measure CO2 per household, and when they did that, the maps just flipped, coolest in the center city, warmer in the suburbs, and red hot in these exurban \"drive till you qualify\" neighborhoods. So a fundamental shift, and now you have environmentalists and economists like Ed Glaeser saying we are a destructive species. If you love nature, the best thing you can do is stay the heck away from it, move to a city, and the denser the better, and the denser cities like Manhattan are the cities that perform the best. So the average Manhattanite is consuming gasoline at the rate the rest of the nation hasn't seen since the '20s, consuming half of the electricity of Dallas. But of course, we can do better. Canadian cities, they consume half the gasoline of American cities. European cities consume half as much again. So obviously, we can do better, and we want to do better, and we're all trying to be green.My final argument in this topic is that I think we're trying to be green the wrong way, and I'm one of many people who believes that this focus on gadgets, on accessorizing \u2014 What can I add to my house, what can I add to what I've already got to make my lifestyle more sustainable? \u2014 has kind of dominated the discussion. So I'm not immune to this. My wife and I built a new house on an abandoned lot in Washington, D.C., and we did our best to clear the shelves of the sustainability store. We've got the solar photovoltaic system, solar hot water heater, dual-flush toilets, bamboo floors. A log burning in my German high-tech stove apparently, supposedly, contributes less carbon to the atmosphere than were it left alone to decompose in the forest. Yet all of these innovations \u2014 That's what they said in the brochure. (Laughter) All of these innovations together contribute a fraction of what we contribute by living in a walkable neighborhood three blocks from a metro in the heart of a city. We've changed all our light bulbs to energy-savers, and you should do the same thing, but changing all your light bulbs to energy-savers saves as much energy in a year as moving to a walkable city does in a week.And we don't want to have this argument. Politicians and marketers are afraid of marketing green as a \"lifestyle choice.\" You don't want to tell Americans, God forbid, that they have to change their lifestyle. But what if lifestyle was really about quality of life and about perhaps something that we would all enjoy more, something that would be better than what we have right now?Well, the gold standard of quality of life rankings, it's called the Mercer Survey. You may have heard of it. They rank hundreds of nations worldwide according to 10 criteria that they believe add up to quality of life: health, economics, education, housing, you name it. There's six more. Short talk.(Laughter)And it's very interesting to see that the highest-ranking American city, Honolulu, number 28, is followed by kind of the usual suspects of Seattle and Boston and all walkable cities. The driving cities in the Sun Belt, the Dallases and the Phoenixes and, sorry, Atlanta, these cities are not appearing on the list. But who's doing even better? The Canadian cities like Vancouver, where again, they're burning half the fuel. And then it's usually won by cities where they speak German, like Dusseldorf or Vienna, where they're burning, again, half as much fuel. And you see this alignment, this strange alignment.Is being more sustainble what gives you a higher quality of life? I would argue the same thing that makes you more sustainble is what gives you a higher quality of life, and that's living in a walkable neighborhood. So sustainability, which includes our wealth and our health may not be a direct function of our sustainability. But particularly here in America, we are polluting so much because we're throwing away our time and our money and our lives on the highway, then these two problems would seem to share the same solution, which is to make our cities more walkable.Doing so isn't easy, but it can be done, it has been done, and it's being done now in more than a few cities, around the globe and in our country. I take some solace from Winston Churchill, who put it this way: \"The Americans can be counted on to do the right thing once they have exhausted the alternatives.\" (Laughter)Thank you.(Applause)",

arts advocate,\n\n00:00:19.548 --> 00:00:23.341\ntrained in architecture and art history,\n\n00:00:23.341 --> 00:00:26.475\nand I want to talk to you today not about design\n\n00:00:26.475 --> 00:00:28.911\nbut about America\n\n00:00:28.911 --> 00:00:33.116\nand how America can be more economically resilient,\n\n00:00:33.116 --> 00:00:35.441\nhow America can be healthier,\n\n00:00:35.441 --> 00:00:37.094\nand how America can be\n\n00:00:37.094 --> 00:00:39.712\nmore environmentally sustainable.\n\n00:00:39.712 --> 00:00:42.130\nAnd I realize this is a global forum,\n\n00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:44.199\nbut I think I need to talk about America\n\n00:00:44.199 --> 00:00:45.782\nbecause there is a history,\n\n00:00:45.782 --> 00:00:47.469\nin some places, not all,\n\n00:00:47.469 --> 00:00:49.919\nof American ideas being appropriated,\n\n00:00:49.919 --> 00:00:52.451\nbeing emulated, for better or for worse,\n\n00:00:52.451 --> 00:00:53.792\naround the world.\n\n00:00:53.792 --> 00:00:55.943\nAnd the worst idea we've ever had\n\n00:00:55.943 --> 00:00:58.310\nis suburban sprawl.\n\n00:00:58.310 --> 00:01:01.681\nIt's being emulated in many places as we speak.\n\n00:01:01.681 --> 00:01:04.344\nBy suburban sprawl, I refer to the reorganization\n\n00:01:04.344 --> 00:01:06.748\nof the landscape and the creation of the landscape\n\n00:01:06.748 --> 00:01:11.084\naround the requirement of automobile use,\n\n00:01:11.084 --> 00:01:13.727\nand that the automobile that was once an instrument of freedom\n\n00:01:13.727 --> 00:01:17.478\nhas become a gas-belching,\n\n00:01:17.478 --> 00:01:20.078\ntime-wasting and life-threatening\n\n00:01:20.078 --> 00:01:21.511\nprosthetic device\n\n00:01:21.511 --> 00:01:23.147\nthat many of us need just to,\n\n00:01:23.147 --> 00:01:24.735\nmost Americans, in fact, need,\n\n00:01:24.735 --> 00:01:27.055\njust to live their daily lives.\n\n00:01:27.055 --> 00:01:28.639\nAnd there's an alternative.\n\n00:01:28.639 --> 00:01:30.227\nYou know, we say, half the world is living in cities.\n\n00:01:30.227 --> 00:01:32.168\nWell, in America, that living in cities,\n\n00:01:32.168 --> 00:01:33.826\nfor many of them, they're living in cities still\n\n00:01:33.826 --> 00:01:36.092\nwhere they're dependent on that automobile.\n\n00:01:36.092 --> 00:01:39.071\nAnd what I work for, and to do,\n\n00:01:39.071 --> 00:01:41.757\nis to make our cities more walkable.\n\n00:01:41.757 --> 00:01:44.280\nBut I can't give design arguments for that\n\n00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:45.969\nthat will have as much impact\n\n00:01:45.969 --> 00:01:47.885\nas the arguments that I've learned\n\n00:01:47.885 --> 00:01:51.402\nfrom the economists, the epidemiologists\n\n00:01:51.402 --> 00:01:53.118\nand the environmentalists.\n\n00:01:53.118 --> 00:01:54.379\nSo these are the three arguments that I'm going\n\n00:01:54.379 --> 00:01:57.490\nto give you quickly today.\n\n00:01:57.490 --> 00:01:58.974\nWhen I was growing up in the '70s,\n\n00:01:58.974 --> 00:02:02.609\nthe typical American spent one tenth of their income,\n\n00:02:02.609 --> 00:02:05.848\nAmerican family, on transportation.\n\n00:02:05.848 --> 00:02:08.433\nSince then, we've doubled the number of roads\n\n00:02:08.433 --> 00:02:11.210\nin America, and we now spend one fifth\n\n00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:13.871\nof our income on transportation.\n\n00:02:13.871 --> 00:02:15.932\nWorking families, which are defined as\n\n00:02:15.932 --> 00:02:17.856\nearning between 20,000 and 50,000 dollars\n\n00:02:17.856 --> 00:02:19.815\na year in America\n\n00:02:19.815 --> 00:02:22.319\nare spending more now on transportation\n\n00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:24.557\nthan on housing, slightly more,\n\n00:02:24.557 --> 00:02:27.790\nbecause of this phenomenon called \"drive till you qualify,\"\n\n00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:30.208\nfinding homes further and further and further\n\n00:02:30.208 --> 00:02:33.135\nfrom the city centers and from their jobs,\n\n00:02:33.135 --> 00:02:35.660\nso that they're locked in this, two, three hours,\n\n00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:37.857\nfour hours a day of commuting.\n\n00:02:37.857 --> 00:02:39.331\nAnd these are the neighborhoods, for example,\n\n00:02:39.331 --> 00:02:41.753\nin the Central Valley of California\n\n00:02:41.753 --> 00:02:44.860\nthat weren't hurt when the housing bubble burst\n\n00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:47.082\nand when the price of gas went up;\n\n00:02:47.082 --> 00:02:49.350\nthey were decimated.\n\n00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:50.616\nAnd in fact, these are many\n\n00:02:50.616 --> 00:02:53.219\nof the half-vacant communities that you see today.\n\n00:02:53.219 --> 00:02:56.400\nImagine putting everything you have into your mortgage,\n\n00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:58.473\nit goes underwater, and you have to pay\n\n00:02:58.473 --> 00:03:02.338\ntwice as much for all the driving that you're doing.\n\n00:03:02.338 --> 00:03:05.058\nSo we know what it's done to our society\n\n00:03:05.058 --> 00:03:07.389\nand all the extra work we have to do\n\n00:03:07.389 --> 00:03:09.158\nto support our cars.\n\n00:03:09.158 --> 00:03:10.890\nWhat happens when a city decides\n\n00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:13.164\nit's going to set other priorities?\n\n00:03:13.164 --> 00:03:15.136\nAnd probably the best example we have here\n\n00:03:15.136 --> 00:03:17.547\nin America is Portland, Oregon.\n\n00:03:17.547 --> 00:03:20.886\nPortland made a bunch of decisions in the 1970s\n\n00:03:20.886 --> 00:03:22.584\nthat began to distinguish it\n\n00:03:22.584 --> 00:03:25.120\nfrom almost every other American city.\n\n00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:27.238\nWhile most other cities were growing\n\n00:03:27.238 --> 00:03:30.373\nan undifferentiated spare tire of sprawl,\n\n00:03:30.373 --> 00:03:33.048\nthey instituted an urban growth boundary.\n\n00:03:33.048 --> 00:03:35.218\nWhile most cities were reaming out their roads,\n\n00:03:35.218 --> 00:03:37.463\nremoving parallel parking and trees\n\n00:03:37.463 --> 00:03:39.664\nin order to flow more traffic,\n\n00:03:39.664 --> 00:03:43.397\nthey instituted a skinny streets program.\n\n00:03:43.397 --> 00:03:47.311\nAnd while most cities were investing in more roads\n\n00:03:47.311 --> 00:03:50.220\nand more highways, they actually invested\n\n00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:52.697\nin bicycling and in walking.\n\n00:03:52.697 --> 00:03:56.762\nAnd they spent 60 million dollars on bike facilities,\n\n00:03:56.762 --> 00:03:58.195\nwhich seems like a lot of money,\n\n00:03:58.195 --> 00:04:00.711\nbut it was spent over about 30 years,\n\n00:04:00.711 --> 00:04:03.080\nso two million dollars a year -- not that much --\n\n00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:05.405\nand half the price of the one cloverleaf\n\n00:04:05.405 --> 00:04:08.224\nthat they decided to rebuild in that city.\n\n00:04:08.224 --> 00:04:10.193\nThese changes and others like them changed\n\n00:04:10.193 --> 00:04:12.155\nthe way that Portlanders live,\n\n00:04:12.155 --> 00:04:14.316\nand their vehicle-miles traveled per day,\n\n00:04:14.316 --> 00:04:15.875\nthe amount that each person drives,\n\n00:04:15.875 --> 00:04:18.188\nactually peaked in 1996,\n\n00:04:18.188 --> 00:04:20.289\nhas been dropping ever since,\n\n00:04:20.289 --> 00:04:22.353\nand they now drive 20 percent less\n\n00:04:22.353 --> 00:04:23.786\nthan the rest of the country.\n\n00:04:23.786 --> 00:04:26.542\nThe typical Portland citizen drives\n\n00:04:26.542 --> 00:04:30.510\nfour miles less, and 11 minutes less per day\n\n00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:32.832\nthan they did before.\n\n00:04:32.832 --> 00:04:34.819\nThe economist Joe Cortright did the math\n\n00:04:34.819 --> 00:04:36.337\nand he found out that those four miles\n\n00:04:36.337 --> 00:04:37.769\nplus those 11 minutes\n\n00:04:37.769 --> 00:04:39.691\nadds up to fully three and a half percent\n\n00:04:39.691 --> 00:04:42.221\nof all income earned in the region.\n\n00:04:42.221 --> 00:04:44.097\nSo if they're not spending that money on driving --\n\n00:04:44.097 --> 00:04:45.710\nand by the way, 85 percent of the money\n\n00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:48.304\nwe spend on driving leaves the local economy --\n\n00:04:48.304 --> 00:04:50.179\nif they're not spending that money on driving,\n\n00:04:50.179 --> 00:04:51.950\nwhat are they spending it on?\n\n00:04:51.950 --> 00:04:53.627\nWell, Portland is reputed to have\n\n00:04:53.627 --> 00:04:56.549\nthe most roof racks per capita,\n\n00:04:56.549 --> 00:04:59.389\nthe most independent bookstores per capita,\n\n00:04:59.389 --> 00:05:02.633\nthe most strip clubs per capita.\n\n00:05:02.633 --> 00:05:05.269\nThese are all exaggerations, slight exaggerations\n\n00:05:05.269 --> 00:05:06.908\nof a fundamental truth, which is Portlanders\n\n00:05:06.908 --> 00:05:10.106\nspend a lot more on recreation of all kinds\n\n00:05:10.106 --> 00:05:12.132\nthan the rest of America.\n\n00:05:12.132 --> 00:05:14.447\nActually, Oregonians spend more on alcohol\n\n00:05:14.447 --> 00:05:15.787\nthan most other states,\n\n00:05:15.787 --> 00:05:17.352\nwhich may be a good thing or a bad thing,\n\n00:05:17.352 --> 00:05:19.351\nbut it makes you glad they're driving less.\n\n00:05:19.351 --> 00:05:21.724\n(Laughter)\n\n00:05:21.724 --> 00:05:25.060\nBut actually, they're spending most of it in their homes,\n\n00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:27.603\nand home investment is about as local\n\n00:05:27.618 --> 00:05:29.741\nan investment as you can get.\n\n00:05:29.741 --> 00:05:31.152\nBut there's a whole other Portland story,\n\n00:05:31.152 --> 00:05:32.697\nwhich isn't part of this calculus,\n\n00:05:32.697 --> 00:05:35.584\nwhich is that young, educated people\n\n00:05:35.584 --> 00:05:38.036\nhave been moving to Portland in droves,\n\n00:05:38.036 --> 00:05:40.554\nso that between the last two censuses,\n\n00:05:40.554 --> 00:05:42.836\nthey had a 50-percent increase\n\n00:05:42.836 --> 00:05:44.700\nin college-educated millennials,\n\n00:05:44.700 --> 00:05:46.884\nwhich is five times what you saw anywhere else\n\n00:05:46.884 --> 00:05:50.160\nin the country, or, I should say, of the national average.\n\n00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:54.473\nSo on the one hand, a city saves money for its residents\n\n00:05:54.473 --> 00:05:57.053\nby being more walkable and more bikeable,\n\n00:05:57.053 --> 00:05:59.888\nbut on the other hand, it also is the cool kind of city\n\n00:05:59.888 --> 00:06:02.706\nthat people want to be in these days.\n\n00:06:02.706 --> 00:06:04.099\nSo the best economic strategy\n\n00:06:04.099 --> 00:06:05.502\nyou can have as a city\n\n00:06:05.502 --> 00:06:09.216\nis not the old way of trying to attract corporations\n\n00:06:09.216 --> 00:06:11.548\nand trying to have a biotech cluster\n\n00:06:11.548 --> 00:06:13.642\nor a medical cluster,\n\n00:06:13.642 --> 00:06:15.051\nor an aerospace cluster,\n\n00:06:15.051 --> 00:06:18.151\nbut to become a place where people want to be.\n\n00:06:18.151 --> 00:06:21.629\nAnd millennials, certainly, these engines of entrepreneurship,\n\n00:06:21.629 --> 00:06:24.470\n64 percent of whom decide first\n\n00:06:24.470 --> 00:06:25.749\nwhere they want to live,\n\n00:06:25.749 --> 00:06:27.765\nthen they move there, then they look for a job,\n\n00:06:27.765 --> 00:06:30.710\nthey will come to your city.\n\n00:06:30.710 --> 00:06:33.571\nThe health argument is a scary one,\n\n00:06:33.571 --> 00:06:36.065\nand you've probably heard part of this argument before.\n\n00:06:36.065 --> 00:06:39.032\nAgain, back in the '70s, a lot's changed since then,\n\n00:06:39.032 --> 00:06:42.142\nback in the '70s, one in 10 Americans was obese.\n\n00:06:42.142 --> 00:06:45.741\nNow one out of three Americans is obese,\n\n00:06:45.741 --> 00:06:49.608\nand a second third of the population is overweight.\n\n00:06:49.608 --> 00:06:51.487\nTwenty-five percent of young men\n\n00:06:51.487 --> 00:06:53.408\nand 40 percent of young women are too heavy\n\n00:06:53.408 --> 00:06:57.059\nto enlist in our own military forces.\n\n00:06:57.059 --> 00:06:59.437\nAccording to the Center for Disease Control,\n\n00:06:59.437 --> 00:07:03.234\nfully one third of all children born after 2000\n\n00:07:03.234 --> 00:07:04.934\nwill get diabetes.\n\n00:07:04.934 --> 00:07:06.907\nWe have the first generation of children in America\n\n00:07:06.907 --> 00:07:10.777\nwho are predicted to live shorter lives than their parents.\n\n00:07:10.777 --> 00:07:12.988\nI believe that this American healthcare crisis\n\n00:07:12.988 --> 00:07:14.426\nthat we've all heard about\n\n00:07:14.426 --> 00:07:17.042\nis an urban design crisis,\n\n00:07:17.042 --> 00:07:19.854\nand that the design of our cities lies at the cure.\n\n00:07:19.854 --> 00:07:22.419\nBecause we've talked a long time about diet,\n\n00:07:22.419 --> 00:07:25.173\nand we know that diet impacts weight,\n\n00:07:25.173 --> 00:07:27.485\nand weight of course impacts health.\n\n00:07:27.485 --> 00:07:30.256\nBut we've only started talking about inactivity,\n\n00:07:30.256 --> 00:07:33.448\nand how inactivity born of our landscape,\n\n00:07:33.448 --> 00:07:35.778\ninactivity that comes from the fact that we live\n\n00:07:35.778 --> 00:07:37.647\nin a place where there is no longer any such thing\n\n00:07:37.647 --> 00:07:41.243\nas a useful walk, is driving our weight up.\n\n00:07:41.243 --> 00:07:42.817\nAnd we finally have the studies,\n\n00:07:42.817 --> 00:07:45.503\none in Britain called \"Gluttony versus sloth\"\n\n00:07:45.503 --> 00:07:48.204\nthat tracked weight against diet\n\n00:07:48.204 --> 00:07:50.109\nand tracked weight against inactivity,\n\n00:07:50.109 --> 00:07:52.812\nand found a much higher, stronger correlation\n\n00:07:52.812 --> 00:07:54.860\nbetween the latter two.\n\n00:07:54.860 --> 00:07:56.877\nDr. James Levine at, in this case,\n\n00:07:56.877 --> 00:07:59.070\nthe aptly-named Mayo Clinic\n\n00:07:59.070 --> 00:08:03.609\nput his test subjects in electronic underwear,\n\n00:08:03.609 --> 00:08:05.602\nheld their diet steady,\n\n00:08:05.602 --> 00:08:07.606\nand then started pumping the calories in.\n\n00:08:07.606 --> 00:08:09.103\nSome people gained weight,\n\n00:08:09.103 --> 00:08:10.480\nsome people didn't gain weight.\n\n00:08:10.480 --> 00:08:13.946\nExpecting some metabolic or DNA factor at work,\n\n00:08:13.946 --> 00:08:15.650\nthey were shocked to learn that the only difference\n\n00:08:15.650 --> 00:08:17.532\nbetween the subjects that they could figure out\n\n00:08:17.532 --> 00:08:19.416\nwas the amount they were moving,\n\n00:08:19.416 --> 00:08:21.056\nand that in fact those who gained weight\n\n00:08:21.056 --> 00:08:24.808\nwere sitting, on average, two hours more per day\n\n00:08:24.808 --> 00:08:26.124\nthan those who didn't.\n\n00:08:26.124 --> 00:08:28.067\nSo we have these studies that tie\n\n00:08:28.067 --> 00:08:30.381\nweight to inactivity, but even more,\n\n00:08:30.381 --> 00:08:32.896\nwe now have studies that tie weight to where you live.\n\n00:08:32.896 --> 00:08:34.529\nDo you live in a more walkable city\n\n00:08:34.529 --> 00:08:35.965\nor do you live in a less walkable city,\n\n00:08:35.965 --> 00:08:37.889\nor where in your city do you live?\n\n00:08:37.889 --> 00:08:40.554\nIn San Diego, they used Walk Score --\n\n00:08:40.554 --> 00:08:42.911\nWalk Score rates every address in America\n\n00:08:42.911 --> 00:08:44.550\nand soon the world\n\n00:08:44.550 --> 00:08:46.939\nin terms of how walkable it is --\n\n00:08:46.939 --> 00:08:49.822\nthey used Walk Score to designate more walkable neighborhoods\n\n00:08:49.822 --> 00:08:51.515\nand less walkable neighborhoods.\n\n00:08:51.515 --> 00:08:54.317\nWell guess what? If you lived in a more walkable neighborhood,\n\n00:08:54.317 --> 00:08:56.588\nyou were 35 percent likely to be overweight.\n\n00:08:56.588 --> 00:08:58.911\nIf you lived in a less walkable neighborhood,\n\n00:08:58.911 --> 00:09:01.118\nyou were 60 percent likely to be overweight.\n\n00:09:01.118 --> 00:09:02.956\nSo we have study after study now\n\n00:09:02.956 --> 00:09:05.011\nthat's tying where you live\n\n00:09:05.011 --> 00:09:07.398\nto your health, particularly as in America,\n\n00:09:07.398 --> 00:09:09.528\nthe biggest health crisis we have is this one\n\n00:09:09.528 --> 00:09:14.252\nthat's stemming from environmental-induced inactivity.\n\n00:09:14.252 --> 00:09:15.975\nAnd I learned a new word last week.\n\n00:09:15.975 --> 00:09:19.605\nThey call these neighborhoods \"obesageneric.\"\n\n00:09:19.605 --> 00:09:22.836\nI may have that wrong, but you get the idea.\n\n00:09:22.836 --> 00:09:24.603\nNow that's one thing, of course.\n\n00:09:24.603 --> 00:09:27.078\nBriefly mentioning, we have an asthma epidemic\n\n00:09:27.078 --> 00:09:28.205\nin this country.\n\n00:09:28.205 --> 00:09:29.863\nYou probably haven't thought that much about it.\n\n00:09:29.863 --> 00:09:32.584\nFourteen Americans die each day from asthma,\n\n00:09:32.584 --> 00:09:35.489\nthree times what it was in the '90s,\n\n00:09:35.489 --> 00:09:38.380\nand it's almost all coming from car exhaust.\n\n00:09:38.380 --> 00:09:40.392\nAmerican pollution does not come\n\n00:09:40.392 --> 00:09:42.700\nfrom factories anymore, it comes from tailpipes,\n\n00:09:42.700 --> 00:09:44.957\nand the amount that people are driving in your city,\n\n00:09:44.957 --> 00:09:47.405\nyour urban VMT, is a good prediction\n\n00:09:47.405 --> 00:09:49.907\nof the asthma problems in your city.\n\n00:09:49.907 --> 00:09:52.122\nAnd then finally, in terms of driving,\n\n00:09:52.122 --> 00:09:55.028\nthere's the issue of the single-largest killer\n\n00:09:55.028 --> 00:09:57.670\nof healthy adults, and one of the largest killers\n\n00:09:57.670 --> 00:09:59.764\nof all people, is car crashes.\n\n00:09:59.764 --> 00:10:01.266\nAnd we take car crashes for granted.\n\n00:10:01.266 --> 00:10:03.101\nWe figure it's a natural risk\n\n00:10:03.101 --> 00:10:04.683\nof being on the road.\n\n00:10:04.683 --> 00:10:07.856\nBut in fact, here in America, 12 people\n\n00:10:07.856 --> 00:10:09.212\nout of every 100,000\n\n00:10:09.212 --> 00:10:11.310\ndie every year from car crashes.\n\n00:10:11.310 --> 00:10:12.779\nWe're pretty safe here.\n\n00:10:12.779 --> 00:10:15.165\nWell, guess what? In England, it's seven per 100,000.\n\n00:10:15.165 --> 00:10:17.003\nIt's Japan, it's four per 100,000.\n\n00:10:17.003 --> 00:10:19.572\nDo you know where it's three per 100,000?\n\n00:10:19.572 --> 00:10:21.297\nNew York City.\n\n00:10:21.297 --> 00:10:23.953\nSan Francisco, the same thing. Portland, the same thing.\n\n00:10:23.953 --> 00:10:26.013\nOh, so cities make us safer\n\n00:10:26.013 --> 00:10:28.182\nbecause we're driving less?\n\n00:10:28.182 --> 00:10:30.601\nTulsa: 14 per 100,000.\n\n00:10:30.601 --> 00:10:33.842\nOrlando: 20 per 100,000.\n\n00:10:33.842 --> 00:10:35.559\nIt's not whether you're in the city or not,\n\n00:10:35.559 --> 00:10:37.245\nit's how is your city designed?\n\n00:10:37.245 --> 00:10:41.077\nWas it designed around cars or around people?\n\n00:10:41.077 --> 00:10:42.847\nBecause if your city is designed around cars,\n\n00:10:42.847 --> 00:10:47.706\nit's really good at smashing them into each other.\n\n00:10:47.706 --> 00:10:51.441\nThat's part of a much larger health argument.\n\n00:10:51.441 --> 00:10:53.710\nFinally, the environmental argument is fascinating,\n\n00:10:53.710 --> 00:10:55.951\nbecause the environmentalists turned on a dime\n\n00:10:55.951 --> 00:10:57.470\nabout 10 years ago.\n\n00:10:57.470 --> 00:10:58.946\nThe environmental movement in America\n\n00:10:58.946 --> 00:11:01.974\nhas historically been an anti-city movement\n\n00:11:01.974 --> 00:11:03.485\nfrom Jefferson on.\n\n00:11:03.485 --> 00:11:05.840\n\"Cities are pestilential to the health,\n\n00:11:05.840 --> 00:11:07.831\nto the liberties, to the morals of man.\n\n00:11:07.831 --> 00:11:09.941\nIf we continue to pile upon ourselves in cities,\n\n00:11:09.941 --> 00:11:11.857\nas they do in Europe, we shall become as corrupt\n\n00:11:11.857 --> 00:11:13.272\nas they are in Europe\n\n00:11:13.272 --> 00:11:15.934\nand take to eating one another as they do there.\"\n\n00:11:15.934 --> 00:11:18.665\nHe apparently had a sense of humor.\n\n00:11:18.665 --> 00:11:20.718\nAnd then the American environmental movement\n\n00:11:20.718 --> 00:11:22.828\nhas been a classically Arcadian movement.\n\n00:11:22.828 --> 00:11:24.941\nTo become more environmental, we move into the country,\n\n00:11:24.941 --> 00:11:27.609\nwe commune with nature, we build suburbs.\n\n00:11:27.609 --> 00:11:31.632\nBut, of course, we've seen what that does.\n\n00:11:31.632 --> 00:11:33.838\nThe carbon mapping of America,\n\n00:11:33.838 --> 00:11:35.725\nwhere is the CO2 being emitted,\n\n00:11:35.725 --> 00:11:37.654\nfor many years only\n\n00:11:37.654 --> 00:11:40.181\nhammered this argument in more strongly.\n\n00:11:40.181 --> 00:11:43.022\nIf you look at any carbon map, because we map it per square mile,\n\n00:11:43.022 --> 00:11:44.537\nany carbon map of the U.S.,\n\n00:11:44.537 --> 00:11:47.680\nit looks like a night sky satellite photo of the U.S.,\n\n00:11:47.680 --> 00:11:50.136\nhottest in the cities, cooler in the suburbs,\n\n00:11:50.136 --> 00:11:53.704\ndark, peaceful in the countryside.\n\n00:11:53.704 --> 00:11:55.643\nUntil some economists said, you know,\n\n00:11:55.643 --> 00:11:58.089\nis that the right way to measure CO2?\n\n00:11:58.089 --> 00:12:00.075\nThere are only so many people in this country at any given time,\n\n00:12:00.075 --> 00:12:02.162\nand we can choose to live where perhaps\n\n00:12:02.162 --> 00:12:03.801\nwe would have a lighter impact.\n\n00:12:03.801 --> 00:12:06.594\nAnd they said, let's measure CO2 per household,\n\n00:12:06.594 --> 00:12:09.198\nand when they did that, the maps just flipped,\n\n00:12:09.198 --> 00:12:12.217\ncoolest in the center city, warmer in the suburbs,\n\n00:12:12.217 --> 00:12:14.893\nand red hot in these exurban\n\n00:12:14.893 --> 00:12:17.665\n\"drive till you qualify\" neighborhoods.\n\n00:12:17.665 --> 00:12:19.618\nSo a fundamental shift, and now you have\n\n00:12:19.618 --> 00:12:22.382\nenvironmentalists and economists like Ed Glaeser\n\n00:12:22.382 --> 00:12:24.949\nsaying we are a destructive species.\n\n00:12:24.949 --> 00:12:27.115\nIf you love nature, the best thing you can do\n\n00:12:27.115 --> 00:12:29.383\nis stay the heck away from it,\n\n00:12:29.383 --> 00:12:31.937\nmove to a city, and the denser the better,\n\n00:12:31.937 --> 00:12:34.441\nand the denser cities like Manhattan\n\n00:12:34.441 --> 00:12:36.777\nare the cities that perform the best.\n\n00:12:36.777 --> 00:12:40.926\nSo the average Manhattanite is consuming gasoline\n\n00:12:40.926 --> 00:12:45.242\nat the rate the rest of the nation hasn't seen since the '20s,\n\n00:12:45.242 --> 00:12:48.716\nconsuming half of the electricity of Dallas.\n\n00:12:48.716 --> 00:12:50.718\nBut of course, we can do better.\n\n00:12:50.718 --> 00:12:53.830\nCanadian cities, they consume half the gasoline of American cities.\n\n00:12:53.830 --> 00:12:57.924\nEuropean cities consume half as much again.\n\n00:12:57.924 --> 00:13:00.120\nSo obviously, we can do better,\n\n00:13:00.120 --> 00:13:03.489\nand we want to do better, and we're all trying to be green.\n\n00:13:03.489 --> 00:13:05.935\nMy final argument in this topic is that\n\n00:13:05.935 --> 00:13:09.589\nI think we're trying to be green the wrong way,\n\n00:13:09.589 --> 00:13:11.765\nand I'm one of many people who believes that\n\n00:13:11.765 --> 00:13:14.837\nthis focus on gadgets,\n\n00:13:14.837 --> 00:13:17.528\non accessorizing --\n\n00:13:17.528 --> 00:13:19.547\nWhat can I add to my house,\n\n00:13:19.547 --> 00:13:21.659\nwhat can I add to what I've already got\n\n00:13:21.659 --> 00:13:24.122\nto make my lifestyle more sustainable? --\n\n00:13:24.122 --> 00:13:26.063\nhas kind of dominated the discussion.\n\n00:13:26.063 --> 00:13:27.917\nSo I'm not immune to this.\n\n00:13:27.917 --> 00:13:29.452\nMy wife and I built a new house\n\n00:13:29.452 --> 00:13:32.451\non an abandoned lot in Washington, D.C.,\n\n00:13:32.451 --> 00:13:34.553\nand we did our best to clear the shelves\n\n00:13:34.553 --> 00:13:36.608\nof the sustainability store.\n\n00:13:36.608 --> 00:13:38.843\nWe've got the solar photovoltaic system,\n\n00:13:38.843 --> 00:13:41.292\nsolar hot water heater, dual-flush toilets,\n\n00:13:41.292 --> 00:13:43.200\nbamboo floors.\n\n00:13:43.200 --> 00:13:46.572\nA log burning in my German high-tech stove\n\n00:13:46.572 --> 00:13:49.261\napparently, supposedly, contributes less carbon\n\n00:13:49.261 --> 00:13:50.942\nto the atmosphere than were it left alone\n\n00:13:50.942 --> 00:13:53.054\nto decompose in the forest.\n\n00:13:53.054 --> 00:13:55.834\nYet all of these innovations --\n\n00:13:55.834 --> 00:13:57.721\nThat's what they said in the brochure.\n\n00:13:57.721 --> 00:13:58.949\n(Laughter)\n\n00:13:58.949 --> 00:14:01.089\nAll of these innovations together\n\n00:14:01.089 --> 00:14:04.173\ncontribute a fraction of what we contribute\n\n00:14:04.173 --> 00:14:06.078\nby living in a walkable neighborhood\n\n00:14:06.078 --> 00:14:09.849\nthree blocks from a metro in the heart of a city.\n\n00:14:09.849 --> 00:14:12.048\nWe've changed all our light bulbs to energy-savers,\n\n00:14:12.048 --> 00:14:13.398\nand you should do the same thing,\n\n00:14:13.398 --> 00:14:15.778\nbut changing all your light bulbs to energy-savers\n\n00:14:15.778 --> 00:14:17.410\nsaves as much energy in a year\n\n00:14:17.410 --> 00:14:20.344\nas moving to a walkable city does in a week.\n\n00:14:20.344 --> 00:14:21.693\nAnd we don't want to have this argument.\n\n00:14:21.693 --> 00:14:23.901\nPoliticians and marketers are afraid\n\n00:14:23.901 --> 00:14:27.634\nof marketing green as a \"lifestyle choice.\"\n\n00:14:27.634 --> 00:14:30.551\nYou don't want to tell Americans, God forbid,\n\n00:14:30.551 --> 00:14:32.412\nthat they have to change their lifestyle.\n\n00:14:32.412 --> 00:14:35.576\nBut what if lifestyle was really about quality of life\n\n00:14:35.576 --> 00:14:38.093\nand about perhaps something that we would all enjoy more,\n\n00:14:38.093 --> 00:14:41.424\nsomething that would be better than what we have right now?\n\n00:14:41.424 --> 00:14:43.935\nWell, the gold standard of quality of life rankings,\n\n00:14:43.935 --> 00:14:45.924\nit's called the Mercer Survey.\n\n00:14:45.924 --> 00:14:47.124\nYou may

It was a city so long ago that it was still called Peking.So I went to a party. I sat down next to a stout, middle-aged man with owl glasses and a bow tie, and he turned out to be a Fulbright scholar, there in China specifically to study Sino-Soviet relations. What a gift it was to the eager, young foreign correspondent that I was then. I'd pump him for information, I'm mentally scribbling notes for the stories I plan to write. I talk to him for hours.Only months later, I discover who he really was. He was the China representative for the American Soybean Association.\"I don't understand. Soybeans? You told me you were a Fulbright scholar.\"\"Well, how long would you have talked to me if I told you we're in soybeans?\"(Laughter)I said, \"You jerk.\" Only jerk wasn't the word I used. I said, \"You could've gotten me fired.\"And he said, \"Let's get married.\" (Laughter) \"Travel the world and have lots of kids.\" So we did.(Laughter)(Applause)And what an alive man Terence Bryan Foley turned out to be. He was a Chinese scholar who later, in his 60s, got a Ph.D. in Chinese history. He spoke six languages, he played 15 musical instruments, he was a licensed pilot, he had once been a San Francisco cable car operator, he was an expert in swine nutrition, dairy cattle, Dixieland jazz, film noir, and we did travel the country, and the world, and we did have a lot of kids. We followed my job, and it seemed like there was nothing that we couldn't do.So when we found the cancer, it doesn't seem strange to us at all that without saying a word to each other, we believed that, if we were smart enough and strong enough and brave enough, and we worked hard enough, we could keep him from dying ever.And for years, it seemed like we were succeeding. The surgeon emerged from the surgery. What'd he say? He said what surgeons always say: \"We got it all.\" Then there was a setback when the pathologists looked at the kidney cancer closely. It turned out to be a rare, exceedingly aggressive type, with a diagnosis that was almost universally fatal in several weeks at most. And yet, he did not die. Mysteriously, he lived on. He coached Little League for our son. He built a playhouse for our daughter. And meanwhile, I'm burying myself in the Internet looking for specialists. I'm looking for a cure.So a year goes by before the cancer, as cancers do, reappears, and with it comes another death sentence, this time nine months. So we try another treatment, aggressive, nasty. It makes him so sick, he has to quit it, yet still he lives on. Then another year goes by. Two years go by. More specialists. We take the kids to Italy. We take the kids to Australia.And then more years pass, and the cancer begins to grow. This time, there's new treatments on the horizon. They're exotic. They're experimental. They're going to attack the cancer in new ways. So he enters a clinical trial, and it works. The cancer begins to shrink, and for the third time, we've dodged death.So now I ask you, how do I feel when the time finally comes and there's another dark night, sometime between midnight and 2 a.m.? This time it's on the intensive care ward when a twentysomething resident that I've never met before tells me that Terence is dying, perhaps tonight.So what do I say when he says, \"What do you want me to do?\"There's another drug out there. It's newer. It's more powerful. He started it just two weeks ago. Perhaps there's still hope ahead.So what do I say?I say, \"Keep him alive if you can.\"And Terence died six days later.So we fought, we struggled, we triumphed. It was an exhilarating fight, and I'd repeat the fight today without a moment's hesitation. We fought together, we lived together. It turned what could have been seven of the grimmest years of our life into seven of the most glorious. It was also an expensive fight. It was the kind of fight and the kind of choices that everyone here agrees pump up the cost of end-of-life care, and of healthcare for all of us.And for me, for us, we pushed the fight right over the edge, and I never got the chance to say to him what I say to him now almost every day: \"Hey, buddy, it was a hell of a ride.\" We never got the chance to say goodbye. We never thought it was the end. We always had hope.So what do we make of all of this?Being a journalist, after Terence died, I wrote a book, \"The Cost Of Hope.\" I wrote it because I wanted to know why I did what I did, why he did what he did, why everyone around us did what they did.And what did I discover? Well, one of the things I discovered is that experts think that one answer to what I did at the end was a piece of paper, the advance directive, to help families get past the seemingly irrational choices. Yet I had that piece of paper. We both did. And they were readily available. I had them right at hand. Both of them said the same thing: Do nothing if there is no further hope. I knew Terence's wishes as clearly and as surely as I knew my own.Yet we never got to no further hope. Even with that clear-cut paper in our hands, we just kept redefining hope. I believed I could keep him from dying, and I'd be embarrassed to say that if I hadn't seen so many people and have talked to so many people who have felt exactly the same way. Right up until days before his death, I felt strongly and powerfully, and, you might say, irrationally, that I could keep him from dying ever.Now, what do the experts call this? They say it's denial. It's a strong word, isn't it? Yet I will tell you that denial isn't even close to a strong enough word to describe what those of us facing the death of our loved ones go through.And I hear the medical professionals say, \"Well, we'd like to do such-and-such, but the family's in denial. The family won't listen to reason. They're in denial. How can they insist on this treatment at the end? It's so clear, yet they're in denial.\"Now, I think this maybe isn't a very useful way of thinking. It's not just families either. The medical professionals too, you out there, you're in denial too. You want to help. You want to fix. You want to do. You've succeeded in everything you've done, and having a patient die, well, that must feel like failure.I saw it firsthand. Just days before Terence died, his oncologist said, \"Tell Terence that better days are just ahead.\" Days before he died.Yet Ira Byock, the director of palliative medicine at Dartmouth said, \"You know, the best doctor in the world has never succeeded in making anyone immortal.\"So what the experts call \"denial,\" I call \"hope,\" and I'd like to borrow a phrase from my friends in software design. You just redefine denial and hope, and it becomes a feature of being human. It's not a bug. It's a feature.(Laughter)So we need to think more constructively about this very common, very profound and very powerful human emotion. It's part of the human condition, and yet our system and our thinking isn't built to accommodate it.So Terence told me a story on that long-ago night, and I believed it. Maybe I wanted to believe it. And during Terence's illness, I, we, we wanted to believe the story of our fight together too. Giving up the fight \u2014 for that's how it felt, it felt like giving up \u2014 meant giving up not only his life but also our story, our story of us as fighters, the story of us as invincible, and for the doctors, the story of themselves as healers.So what do we need?Maybe we don't need a new piece of paper. Maybe we need a new story, not a story about giving up the fight or of hopelessness, but rather a story of victory and triumph, of a valiant battle and, eventually, a graceful retreat, a story that acknowledges that not even the greatest general defeats every foe, that no doctor has ever succeeded in making anyone immortal, and that no wife, no matter how hard she tried, has ever stopped even the bravest, wittiest and most maddeningly lovable husband from dying when it was his time to go.People did mention hospice, but I wouldn't listen. Hospice was for people who were dying, and Terence wasn't dying. As a result, he spent just four days in hospice, which I'm sure, as you all know, is a pretty typical outcome, and we never said goodbye because we were unprepared for the end.We have a noble path to curing the disease, patients and doctors alike, but there doesn't seem to be a noble path to dying. Dying is seen as failing, and we had a heroic narrative for fighting together, but we didn't have a heroic narrative for letting go.So maybe we need a narrative for acknowledging the end, and for saying goodbye, and maybe our new story will be about a hero's fight, and a hero's goodbye. Terence loved poetry, and the Greek poet Constantine Cavafy is one of my favorite poets. So I'll give you a couple lines from him. This is a poem about Mark Antony. You know Mark Antony, the conquering hero, Cleopatra's guy? Actually, one of Cleopatra's guys. And he's been a pretty good general. He's won all the fights, he's eluded all the people that are out to get him, and yet this time, finally, he's come to the city of Alexandria and realized he's lost. The people are leaving. They're playing instruments. They're singing. And suddenly he knows he's been defeated. And he suddenly knows he's been deserted by the gods, and it's time to let go. And the poet tells him what to do. He tells him how to say a noble goodbye, a goodbye that's fit for a hero.\"As if long-prepared, as if courageous, as it becomes you who were worthy of such a city, approach the window with a firm step, and with emotion, but not with the entreaties or the complaints of a coward, as a last enjoyment, listen to the sounds, the exquisite instruments of the musical troops, and bid her farewell, the Alexandria you are losing.\"That's a goodbye for a man who was larger than life, a goodbye for a man for whom anything, well, almost anything, was possible, a goodbye for a man who kept hope alive.And isn't that what we're missing? How can we learn that people's decisions about their loved ones are often based strongly, powerfully, many times irrationally, on the slimmest of hopes? The overwhelming presence of hope isn't denial. It's part of our DNA as humans, and maybe it's time our healthcare system \u2014 doctors, patients, insurance companies, us, started accounting for the power of that hope. Hope isn't a bug.

He said what surgeons always say:\n\n00:03:07.375 --> 00:03:09.377\n\"We got it all.\"\n\n00:03:09.377 --> 00:03:12.420\nThen there was a setback when the pathologists\n\n00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:14.793\nlooked at the kidney cancer closely.\n\n00:03:14.793 --> 00:03:16.422\nIt turned out to be a rare,\n\n00:03:16.422 --> 00:03:18.231\nexceedingly aggressive type,\n\n00:03:18.231 --> 00:03:21.313\nwith a diagnosis that was almost universally fatal\n\n00:03:21.313 --> 00:03:23.704\nin several weeks at most.\n\n00:03:23.704 --> 00:03:27.414\nAnd yet, he did not die.\n\n00:03:27.414 --> 00:03:30.924\nMysteriously, he lived on.\n\n00:03:30.924 --> 00:03:33.008\nHe coached Little League for our son.\n\n00:03:33.008 --> 00:03:35.560\nHe built a playhouse for our daughter.\n\n00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:38.634\nAnd meanwhile, I'm burying myself in the Internet\n\n00:03:38.634 --> 00:03:40.308\nlooking for specialists.\n\n00:03:40.308 --> 00:03:42.869\nI'm looking for a cure.\n\n00:03:42.869 --> 00:03:44.946\nSo a year goes by\n\n00:03:44.946 --> 00:03:48.152\nbefore the cancer, as cancers do,\n\n00:03:48.152 --> 00:03:50.152\nreappears,\n\n00:03:50.152 --> 00:03:52.228\nand with it comes another death sentence,\n\n00:03:52.228 --> 00:03:54.421\nthis time nine months.\n\n00:03:54.421 --> 00:03:58.435\nSo we try another treatment, aggressive, nasty.\n\n00:03:58.435 --> 00:04:00.255\nIt makes him so sick, he has to quit it,\n\n00:04:00.255 --> 00:04:03.272\nyet still he lives on.\n\n00:04:03.272 --> 00:04:05.168\nThen another year goes by.\n\n00:04:05.168 --> 00:04:06.718\nTwo years go by.\n\n00:04:06.718 --> 00:04:08.207\nMore specialists.\n\n00:04:08.207 --> 00:04:10.127\nWe take the kids to Italy.\n\n00:04:10.127 --> 00:04:12.596\nWe take the kids to Australia.\n\n00:04:12.596 --> 00:04:15.308\nAnd then more years pass,\n\n00:04:15.308 --> 00:04:17.698\nand the cancer begins to grow.\n\n00:04:17.698 --> 00:04:20.233\nThis time, there's new treatments on the horizon.\n\n00:04:20.233 --> 00:04:22.169\nThey're exotic. They're experimental.\n\n00:04:22.169 --> 00:04:25.377\nThey're going to attack the cancer in new ways.\n\n00:04:25.377 --> 00:04:29.703\nSo he enters a clinical trial, and it works.\n\n00:04:29.703 --> 00:04:31.632\nThe cancer begins to shrink,\n\n00:04:31.632 --> 00:04:33.909\nand for the third time,\n\n00:04:33.909 --> 00:04:37.268\nwe've dodged death.\n\n00:04:37.268 --> 00:04:40.565\nSo now I ask you,\n\n00:04:40.565 --> 00:04:42.954\nhow do I feel\n\n00:04:42.954 --> 00:04:45.468\nwhen the time finally comes\n\n00:04:45.468 --> 00:04:47.974\nand there's another dark night,\n\n00:04:47.974 --> 00:04:50.475\nsometime between midnight and 2 a.m.?\n\n00:04:50.475 --> 00:04:53.449\nThis time it's on the intensive care ward\n\n00:04:53.449 --> 00:04:55.287\nwhen a twentysomething resident\n\n00:04:55.287 --> 00:04:57.490\nthat I've never met before\n\n00:04:57.490 --> 00:05:00.083\ntells me that Terence is dying,\n\n00:05:00.083 --> 00:05:02.282\nperhaps tonight.\n\n00:05:02.282 --> 00:05:05.075\nSo what do I say when he says,\n\n00:05:05.075 --> 00:05:07.889\n\"What do you want me to do?\"\n\n00:05:07.889 --> 00:05:09.901\nThere's another drug out there.\n\n00:05:09.901 --> 00:05:11.589\nIt's newer. It's more powerful.\n\n00:05:11.589 --> 00:05:14.158\nHe started it just two weeks ago.\n\n00:05:14.158 --> 00:05:17.267\nPerhaps there's still hope ahead.\n\n00:05:17.267 --> 00:05:19.222\nSo what do I say?\n\n00:05:19.222 --> 00:05:22.578\nI say, \"Keep him alive if you can.\"\n\n00:05:22.578 --> 00:05:26.093\nAnd Terence died six days later.\n\n00:05:26.093 --> 00:05:30.141\nSo we fought, we struggled, we triumphed.\n\n00:05:30.141 --> 00:05:31.937\nIt was an exhilarating fight,\n\n00:05:31.937 --> 00:05:33.654\nand I'd repeat the fight today\n\n00:05:33.654 --> 00:05:36.303\nwithout a moment's hesitation.\n\n00:05:36.303 --> 00:05:39.254\nWe fought together, we lived together.\n\n00:05:39.254 --> 00:05:41.358\nIt turned what could have been\n\n00:05:41.358 --> 00:05:44.092\nseven of the grimmest years of our life\n\n00:05:44.092 --> 00:05:47.703\ninto seven of the most glorious.\n\n00:05:47.703 --> 00:05:50.478\nIt was also an expensive fight.\n\n00:05:50.478 --> 00:05:52.439\nIt was the kind of fight and the kind of choices\n\n00:05:52.439 --> 00:05:54.073\nthat everyone here agrees\n\n00:05:54.073 --> 00:05:56.478\npump up the cost of end-of-life care,\n\n00:05:56.478 --> 00:05:58.764\nand of healthcare for all of us.\n\n00:05:58.764 --> 00:06:01.846\nAnd for me, for us,\n\n00:06:01.846 --> 00:06:03.928\nwe pushed the fight right over the edge,\n\n00:06:03.928 --> 00:06:07.153\nand I never got the chance to say to him\n\n00:06:07.153 --> 00:06:10.573\nwhat I say to him now almost every day:\n\n00:06:10.573 --> 00:06:13.650\n\"Hey, buddy, it was a hell of a ride.\"\n\n00:06:13.650 --> 00:06:16.138\nWe never got the chance to say goodbye.\n\n00:06:16.138 --> 00:06:18.417\nWe never thought it was the end.\n\n00:06:18.417 --> 00:06:23.596\nWe always had hope.\n\n00:06:23.596 --> 00:06:27.460\nSo what do we make of all of this?\n\n00:06:27.460 --> 00:06:31.038\nBeing a journalist, after Terence died,\n\n00:06:31.038 --> 00:06:34.327\nI wrote a book, \"The Cost Of Hope.\"\n\n00:06:34.327 --> 00:06:36.477\nI wrote it because I wanted to know\n\n00:06:36.477 --> 00:06:38.163\nwhy I did what I did,\n\n00:06:38.163 --> 00:06:39.964\nwhy he did what he did,\n\n00:06:39.964 --> 00:06:42.519\nwhy everyone around us did what they did.\n\n00:06:42.519 --> 00:06:44.155\nAnd what did I discover?\n\n00:06:44.155 --> 00:06:45.729\nWell, one of the things I discovered is that\n\n00:06:45.729 --> 00:06:48.806\nexperts think that one answer to\n\n00:06:48.806 --> 00:06:51.556\nwhat I did at the end was a piece of paper,\n\n00:06:51.556 --> 00:06:53.714\nthe advance directive,\n\n00:06:53.714 --> 00:06:58.054\nto help families get past the seemingly irrational choices.\n\n00:06:58.054 --> 00:07:02.168\nYet I had that piece of paper.\n\n00:07:02.168 --> 00:07:04.221\nWe both did.\n\n00:07:04.221 --> 00:07:05.911\nAnd they were readily available.\n\n00:07:05.911 --> 00:07:07.850\nI had them right at hand.\n\n00:07:07.850 --> 00:07:10.209\nBoth of them said the same thing:\n\n00:07:10.209 --> 00:07:14.710\nDo nothing if there is no further hope.\n\n00:07:14.710 --> 00:07:16.930\nI knew Terence's wishes\n\n00:07:16.930 --> 00:07:20.744\nas clearly and as surely as I knew my own.\n\n00:07:20.744 --> 00:07:25.948\nYet we never got to no further hope.\n\n00:07:25.948 --> 00:07:28.705\nEven with that clear-cut paper in our hands,\n\n00:07:28.705 --> 00:07:31.961\nwe just kept redefining hope.\n\n00:07:31.961 --> 00:07:37.253\nI believed I could keep him from dying,\n\n00:07:37.253 --> 00:07:40.067\nand I'd be embarrassed to say that if I hadn't seen\n\n00:07:40.067 --> 00:07:42.278\nso many people and have talked to so many people\n\n00:07:42.278 --> 00:07:44.952\nwho have felt exactly the same way.\n\n00:07:44.952 --> 00:07:48.886\nRight up until days before his death,\n\n00:07:48.886 --> 00:07:52.212\nI felt strongly\n\n00:07:52.212 --> 00:07:56.255\nand powerfully, and, you might say, irrationally,\n\n00:07:56.255 --> 00:08:01.502\nthat I could keep him from dying ever.\n\n00:08:01.502 --> 00:08:04.737\nNow, what do the experts call this?\n\n00:08:04.737 --> 00:08:07.084\nThey say it's denial.\n\n00:08:07.084 --> 00:08:09.275\nIt's a strong word, isn't it?\n\n00:08:09.275 --> 00:08:11.672\nYet I will tell you that denial\n\n00:08:11.672 --> 00:08:16.786\nisn't even close to a strong enough word\n\n00:08:16.786 --> 00:08:19.432\nto describe what those of us\n\n00:08:19.432 --> 00:08:23.070\nfacing the death of our loved ones go through.\n\n00:08:23.070 --> 00:08:25.411\nAnd I hear the medical professionals say,\n\n00:08:25.411 --> 00:08:27.494\n\"Well, we'd like to do such-and-such,\n\n00:08:27.494 --> 00:08:29.945\nbut the family's in denial.\n\n00:08:29.945 --> 00:08:32.121\nThe family won't listen to reason.\n\n00:08:32.121 --> 00:08:34.143\nThey're in denial.\n\n00:08:34.143 --> 00:08:36.495\nHow can they insist on this treatment at the end?\n\n00:08:36.495 --> 00:08:39.799\nIt's so clear, yet they're in denial.\"\n\n00:08:39.799 --> 00:08:41.806\nNow, I think this maybe isn't\n\n00:08:41.806 --> 00:08:44.810\na very useful way of thinking.\n\n00:08:44.810 --> 00:08:47.088\nIt's not just families either.\n\n00:08:47.088 --> 00:08:49.213\nThe medical professionals too,\n\n00:08:49.213 --> 00:08:52.573\nyou out there, you're in denial too.\n\n00:08:52.573 --> 00:08:55.426\nYou want to help. You want to fix.\n\n00:08:55.426 --> 00:08:57.252\nYou want to do.\n\n00:08:57.252 --> 00:09:00.060\nYou've succeeded in everything you've done,\n\n00:09:00.060 --> 00:09:02.102\nand having a patient die,\n\n00:09:02.102 --> 00:09:05.681\nwell, that must feel like failure.\n\n00:09:05.681 --> 00:09:07.525\nI saw it firsthand.\n\n00:09:07.525 --> 00:09:10.227\nJust days before Terence died,\n\n00:09:10.227 --> 00:09:12.245\nhis oncologist said,\n\n00:09:12.245 --> 00:09:15.493\n\"Tell Terence that better days are just ahead.\"\n\n00:09:15.493 --> 00:09:17.875\nDays before he died.\n\n00:09:17.875 --> 00:09:19.308\nYet Ira Byock,\n\n00:09:19.308 --> 00:09:21.656\nthe director of palliative medicine at Dartmouth\n\n00:09:21.656 --> 00:09:24.587\nsaid, \"You know, the best doctor in the world\n\n00:09:24.587 --> 00:09:29.195\nhas never succeeded in making anyone immortal.\"\n\n00:09:29.195 --> 00:09:35.701\nSo what the experts call \"denial,\" I call \"hope,\"\n\n00:09:35.701 --> 00:09:38.035\nand I'd like to borrow a phrase\n\n00:09:38.035 --> 00:09:41.256\nfrom my friends in software design.\n\n00:09:41.256 --> 00:09:44.818\nYou just redefine denial and hope,\n\n00:09:44.818 --> 00:09:48.046\nand it becomes a feature of being human.\n\n00:09:48.046 --> 00:09:49.907\nIt's not a bug.\n\n00:09:49.907 --> 00:09:52.233\nIt's a feature.\n\n00:09:52.233 --> 00:09:55.327\n(Laughter)\n\n00:09:55.327 --> 00:09:59.021\nSo we need to think more constructively\n\n00:09:59.021 --> 00:10:03.333\nabout this very common, very profound\n\n00:10:03.333 --> 00:10:07.289\nand very powerful human emotion.\n\n00:10:07.289 --> 00:10:09.913\nIt's part of the human condition,\n\n00:10:09.913 --> 00:10:12.090\nand yet our system and our thinking\n\n00:10:12.090 --> 00:10:15.259\nisn't built to accommodate it.\n\n00:10:15.259 --> 00:10:18.314\nSo Terence told me a story on that long-ago night,\n\n00:10:18.314 --> 00:10:20.219\nand I believed it.\n\n00:10:20.219 --> 00:10:23.333\nMaybe I wanted to believe it.\n\n00:10:23.333 --> 00:10:28.662\nAnd during Terence's illness, I, we,\n\n00:10:28.662 --> 00:10:30.384\nwe wanted to believe the story\n\n00:10:30.384 --> 00:10:32.979\nof our fight together too.\n\n00:10:32.979 --> 00:10:36.715\nGiving up the fight -- for that's how it felt,\n\n00:10:36.715 --> 00:10:38.654\nit felt like giving up --\n\n00:10:38.654 --> 00:10:41.371\nmeant giving up not only his life\n\n00:10:41.371 --> 00:10:45.078\nbut also our story,\n\n00:10:45.078 --> 00:10:47.288\nour story of us as fighters,\n\n00:10:47.288 --> 00:10:50.218\nthe story of us as invincible,\n\n00:10:50.218 --> 00:10:52.426\nand for the doctors, the story of themselves\n\n00:10:52.426 --> 00:10:54.984\nas healers.\n\n00:10:54.984 --> 00:10:57.668\nSo what do we need?\n\n00:10:57.668 --> 00:11:00.607\nMaybe we don't need a new piece of paper.\n\n00:11:00.607 --> 00:11:03.554\nMaybe we need a new story,\n\n00:11:03.554 --> 00:11:07.563\nnot a story about giving up the fight\n\n00:11:07.563 --> 00:11:09.834\nor of hopelessness,\n\n00:11:09.834 --> 00:11:13.245\nbut rather a story of victory and triumph,\n\n00:11:13.245 --> 00:11:18.088\nof a valiant battle and, eventually,\n\n00:11:18.088 --> 00:11:20.408\na graceful retreat,\n\n00:11:20.408 --> 00:11:23.415\na story that acknowledges\n\n00:11:23.415 --> 00:11:27.178\nthat not even the greatest general defeats every foe,\n\n00:11:27.178 --> 00:11:29.799\nthat no doctor has ever succeeded\n\n00:11:29.799 --> 00:11:32.189\nin making anyone immortal,\n\n00:11:32.189 --> 00:11:38.255\nand that no wife, no matter how hard she tried,\n\n00:11:38.255 --> 00:11:42.940\nhas ever stopped even the bravest,\n\n00:11:42.940 --> 00:11:46.989\nwittiest and most maddeningly lovable husband\n\n00:11:46.989 --> 00:11:51.182\nfrom dying when it was his time to go.\n\n00:11:51.182 --> 00:11:53.495\nPeople did mention hospice,\n\n00:11:53.495 --> 00:11:56.866\nbut I wouldn't listen.\n\n00:11:56.866 --> 00:12:00.791\nHospice was for people who were dying,\n\n00:12:00.791 --> 00:12:03.564\nand Terence wasn't dying.\n\n00:12:03.564 --> 00:12:06.474\nAs a result, he spent just four days in hospice,\n\n00:12:06.474 --> 00:12:08.291\nwhich I'm sure, as you all know,\n\n00:12:08.291 --> 00:12:10.381\nis a pretty typical outcome,\n\n00:12:10.381 --> 00:12:11.893\nand we never said goodbye\n\n00:12:11.893 --> 00:12:14.948\nbecause we were unprepared for the end.\n\n00:12:14.948 --> 00:12:18.695\nWe have a noble path to curing the disease,\n\n00:12:18.695 --> 00:12:21.025\npatients and doctors alike,\n\n00:12:21.025 --> 00:12:23.148\nbut there doesn't seem to be\n\n00:12:23.148 --> 00:12:25.748\na noble path to dying.\n\n00:12:25.748 --> 00:12:28.806\nDying is seen as failing,\n\n00:12:28.806 --> 00:12:31.458\nand we had a heroic narrative\n\n00:12:31.458 --> 00:12:33.551\nfor fighting together,\n\n00:12:33.551 --> 00:12:38.581\nbut we didn't have a heroic narrative for letting go.\n\n00:12:38.581 --> 00:12:42.699\nSo maybe we need a narrative\n\n00:12:42.699 --> 00:12:46.175\nfor acknowledging the end, and for saying goodbye,\n\n00:12:46.175 --> 00:12:48.737\nand maybe our new story will be\n\n00:12:48.737 --> 00:12:53.343\nabout a hero's fight, and a hero's goodbye.\n\n00:12:53.343 --> 00:12:55.810\nTerence loved poetry,\n\n00:12:55.810 --> 00:12:59.037\nand the Greek poet Constantine Cavafy\n\n00:12:59.037 --> 00:13:01.466\nis one of my favorite poets.\n\n00:13:01.466 --> 00:13:04.350\nSo I'll give you a couple lines from him.\n\n00:13:04.350 --> 00:13:06.566\nThis is a poem about Mark Antony.\n\n00:13:06.566 --> 00:13:09.259\nYou know Mark Antony, the conquering hero,\n\n00:13:09.259 --> 00:13:11.124\nCleopatra's guy?\n\n00:13:11.124 --> 00:13:13.661\nActually, one of Cleopatra's guys.\n\n00:13:13.661 --> 00:13:16.086\nAnd he's been a pretty good general.\n\n00:13:16.086 --> 00:13:17.146\nHe's won all the fights,\n\n00:13:17.146 --> 00:13:19.601\nhe's eluded all the people that are out to get him,\n\n00:13:19.601 --> 00:13:21.389\nand yet this time, finally,\n\n00:13:21.389 --> 00:13:23.138\nhe's come to the city of Alexandria\n\n00:13:23.138 --> 00:13:24.820\nand realized he's lost.\n\n00:13:24.820 --> 00:13:26.536\nThe people are leaving. They're playing instruments.\n\n00:13:26.536 --> 00:13:27.859\nThey're singing.\n\n00:13:27.859 --> 00:13:30.459\nAnd suddenly he knows he's been defeated.\n\n00:13:30.459 --> 00:13:32.638\nAnd he suddenly knows\n\n00:13:32.638 --> 00:13:35.163\nhe's been deserted by the gods,\n\n00:13:35.163 --> 00:13:37.103\nand it's time to let go.\n\n00:13:37.103 --> 00:13:39.070\nAnd the poet tells him what to do.\n\n00:13:39.070 --> 00:13:42.336\nHe tells him how to say a noble goodbye,\n\n00:13:42.336 --> 00:13:46.183\na goodbye that's fit for a hero.\n\n00:13:46.183 --> 00:13:48.932\n\"As if long-prepared,\n\n00:13:48.932 --> 00:13:51.611\nas if courageous,\n\n00:13:51.611 --> 00:13:54.208\nas it becomes you\n\n00:13:54.208 --> 00:13:56.380\nwho were worthy of such a city,\n\n00:13:56.380 --> 00:13:58.783\napproach the window with a firm step,\n\n00:13:58.783 --> 00:14:01.318\nand with emotion,\n\n00:14:01.318 --> 00:14:03.517\nbut not with the entreaties\n\n00:14:03.517 --> 00:14:06.278\nor the complaints of a coward,\n\n00:14:06.278 --> 00:14:08.249\nas a last enjoyment,\n\n00:14:08.249 --> 00:14:10.373\nlisten to the sounds,\n\n00:14:10.373 --> 00:14:13.707\nthe exquisite instruments of the musical troops,\n\n00:14:13.707 --> 00:14:15.988\nand bid her farewell,\n\n00:14:15.988 --> 00:14:20.403\nthe Alexandria you are losing.\"\n\n00:14:20.403 --> 00:14:24.093\nThat's a goodbye for a man who was larger than life,\n\n00:14:24.093 --> 00:14:26.111\na goodbye for a man\n\n00:14:26.111 --> 00:14:28.085\nfor whom anything,\n\n00:14:28.085 --> 00:14:31.193\nwell, almost anything,\n\n00:14:31.193 --> 00:14:33.083\nwas possible,\n\n00:14:33.083 --> 00:14:36.223\na goodbye for a man who kept hope alive.\n\n00:14:36.223 --> 00:14:38.416\nAnd isn't that what we're missing?\n\n00:14:38.416 --> 00:14:40.475\nHow can we learn that people's decisions\n\n00:14:40.475 --> 00:14:41.985\nabout their loved ones\n\n00:14:41.985 --> 00:14:45.914\nare often based strongly, powerfully,\n\n00:14:45.914 --> 00:14:48.766\nmany times irrationally,\n\n00:14:48.766 --> 00:14:51.110\non the slimmest of hopes?\n\n00:14:51.110 --> 00:14:54.132\nThe overwhelming presence of hope\n\n00:14:54.132 --> 00:14:55.555\nisn't denial.\n\n00:14:55.555 --> 00:14:58.375\nIt's part of our DNA as humans,\n\n00:14:58.375 --> 00:15:00.693\nand maybe it's time our healthcare system --\n\n00:15:00.693 --> 00:15:05.177\ndoctors, patients, insurance companies, us,\n\n00:15:05.177 --> 00:15:09.151\nstarted accounting for the power of that hope.\n\n00:15:09.151 --> 00:15:11.451\nHope isn't a bug.\n\n00:15:11.451 --> 00:15:13.820\nIt's a feature.\n\n00:15:13.820 --> 00:15:16.315\nThank you.\n\n00:15:16.315 --> 00:15:19.370\n(Applause)"}, {"title": "Ingenious homes in unexpected places", "duration": "1018", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/iwan_baan_ingenious_homes_in_unexpected_places", "transcript": "Throughout my career, I've been fortunate enough to work with many of the great international architects, documenting their work and observing how their designs have the capacity to influence the cities in which they sit. I think of new cities like Dubai or ancient cities like Rome with Zaha Hadid's incredible MAXXI museum, or like right here in New York with the High Line, a city which has been so much influenced by the development of this.But what I find really fascinating is what happens when architects and planners leave and these places become appropriated by people, like here in Chandigarh, India, the city which has been completely designed by the architect Le Corbusier. Now 60 years later, the city has been taken over by people in very different ways from whatever perhaps intended for, like here, where you have the people sitting in the windows of the assembly hall. But over the course of several years, I've been documenting Rem Koolhaas's CCTV building in Beijing and the olympic stadium in the same city by the architects Herzog and de Meuron. At these large-scale construction sites in China, you see a sort of makeshift camp where workers live during the entire building process. As the length of the construction takes years, workers end up forming a rather rough-and-ready informal city, making for quite a juxtaposition against the sophisticated structures that they're building.Over the past seven years, I've been following my fascination with the built environment, and for those of you who know me, you would say that this obsession has led me to live out of a suitcase 365 days a year. Being constantly on the move means that sometimes I am able to catch life's most unpredictable moments, like here in New York the day after the Sandy storm hit the city.Just over three years ago, I was for the first time in Caracas, Venezuela, and while flying over the city, I was just amazed by the extent to which the slums reach into every corner of the city, a place where nearly 70 percent of the population lives in slums, draped literally all over the mountains. During a conversation with local architects Urban-Think Tank, I learned about the Torre David, a 45-story office building which sits right in the center of Caracas. The building was under construction until the collapse of the Venezuelan economy and the death of the developer in the early '90s. About eight years ago, people started moving into the abandoned tower and began to build their homes right in between every column of this unfinished tower. There's only one little entrance to the entire building, and the 3,000 residents come in and out through that single door. Together, the inhabitants created public spaces and designed them to feel more like a home and less like an unfinished tower. In the lobby, they painted the walls and planted trees. They also made a basketball court. But when you look up closely, you see massive holes where elevators and services would have run through.Within the tower, people have come up with all sorts of solutions in response to the various needs which arise from living in an unfinished tower. With no elevators, the tower is like a 45-story walkup. Designed in very specific ways by this group of people who haven't had any education in architecture or design. And with each inhabitant finding their own unique way of coming by, this tower becomes like a living city, a place which is alive with micro-economies and small businesses. The inventive inhabitants, for instance, find opportunities in the most unexpected cases, like the adjacent parking garage, which has been reclaimed as a taxi route to shuttle the inhabitants up through the ramps in order to shorten the hike up to the apartments.A walk through the tower reveals how residents have figured out how to create walls, how to make an air flow, how to create transparency, circulation throughout the tower, essentially creating a home that's completely adapted to the conditions of the site. When a new inhabitant moves into the tower, they already have a roof over their head, so they just typically mark their space with a few curtains or sheets. Slowly, from found materials, walls rise, and people create a space out of any found objects or materials.It's remarkable to see the design decisions that they're making, like when everything is made out of red bricks, some residents will cover that red brick with another layer of red brick-patterned wallpaper just to make it a kind of clean finish.The inhabitants literally built up these homes with their own hands, and this labor of love instills a great sense of pride in many families living in this tower. They typically make the best out of their conditions, and try to make their spaces look nice and homey, or at least up until as far as they can reach. Throughout the tower, you come across all kinds of services, like the barber, small factories, and every floor has a little grocery store or shop. And you even find a church. And on the 30th floor, there is a gym where all the weights and barbells are made out of the leftover pulleys from the elevators which were never installed. From the outside, behind this always-changing facade, you see how the fixed concrete beams provide a framework for the inhabitants to create their homes in an organic, intuitive way that responds directly to their needs.Let's go now to Africa, to Nigeria, to a community called Makoko, a slum where 150,000 people live just meters above the Lagos Lagoon. While it may appear to be a completely chaotic place, when you see it from above, there seems to be a whole grid of waterways and canals connecting each and every home. From the main dock, people board long wooden canoes which carry them out to their various homes and shops located in the expansive area. When out on the water, it's clear that life has been completely adapted to this very specific way of living. Even the canoes become variety stores where ladies paddle from house to house, selling anything from toothpaste to fresh fruits. Behind every window and door frame, you'll see a small child peering back at you, and while Makoko seems to be packed with people, what's more shocking is actually the amount of children pouring out of every building. The population growth in Nigeria, and especially in these areas like Makoko, are painful reminders of how out of control things really are.In Makoko, very few systems and infrastructures exist. Electricity is rigged and freshest water comes from self-built wells throughout the area. This entire economic model is designed to meet a specific way of living on the water, so fishing and boat-making are common professions. You'll have a set of entrepreneurs who have set up businesses throughout the area, like barbershops, CD and DVD stores, movie theaters, tailors, everything is there. There is even a photo studio where you see the sort of aspiration to live in a real house or to be associated with a faraway place, like that hotel in Sweden.On this particular evening, I came across this live band dressed to the T in their coordinating outfits. They were floating through the canals in a large canoe with a fitted-out generator for all of the community to enjoy.By nightfall, the area becomes almost pitch black, save for a small lightbulb or a fire.What originally brought me to Makoko was this project from a friend of mine, Kunl\u00e9 Adeyemi, who recently finished building this three-story floating school for the kids in Makoko. With this entire village existing on the water, public space is very limited, so now that the school is finished, the ground floor is a playground for the kids, but when classes are out, the platform is just like a town square, where the fishermen mend their nets and floating shopkeepers dock their boats.Another place I'd like to share with you is the Zabbaleen in Cairo. They're descendants of farmers who began migrating from the upper Egypt in the '40s, and today they make their living by collecting and recycling waste from homes from all over Cairo. For years, the Zabbaleen would live in makeshift villages where they would move around trying to avoid the local authorities, but in the early 1980s, they settled on the Mokattam rocks just at the eastern edge of the city. Today, they live in this area, approximately 50,000 to 70,000 people, who live in this community of self-built multi-story houses where up to three generations live in one structure. While these apartments that they built for themselves appear to lack any planning or formal grid, each family specializing in a certain form of recycling means that the ground floor of each apartment is reserved for garbage-related activities and the upper floor is dedicated to living space. I find it incredible to see how these piles and piles of garbage are invisible to the people who live there, like this very distinguished man who is posing while all this garbage is sort of streaming out behind him, or like these two young men who are sitting and chatting amongst these tons of garbage. While to most of us, living amongst these piles and piles of garbage may seem totally uninhabitable, to those in the Zabbaleen, this is just a different type of normal. In all these places I've talked about today, what I do find fascinating is that there's really no such thing as normal, and it proves that people are able to adapt to any kind of situation. Throughout the day, it's quite common to come across a small party taking place in the streets, just like this engagement party. In this tradition, the bride-to-be displays all of their belongings, which they soon bring to their new husband. A gathering like this one offers such a juxtaposition where all the new stuff is displayed and all the garbage is used as props to display all their new home accessories. Like Makoko and the Torre David, throughout the Zabbaleen you'll find all the same facilities as in any typical neighborhood. There are the retail shops, the cafes and the restaurants, and the community is this community of Coptic Christians, so you'll also find a church, along with the scores of religious iconographies throughout the area, and also all the everyday services like the electronic repair shops, the barbers, everything.Visiting the homes of the Zabbaleen is also full of surprises. While from the outside, these homes look like any other informal structure in the city, when you step inside, you are met with all manner of design decisions and interior decoration. Despite having limited access to space and money, the homes in the area are designed with care and detail. Every apartment is unique, and this individuality tells a story about each family's circumstances and values. Many of these people take their homes and interior spaces very seriously, putting a lot of work and care into the details. The shared spaces are also treated in the same manner, where walls are decorated in faux marble patterns.But despite this elaborate decor, sometimes these apartments are used in very unexpected ways, like this home which caught my attention while all the mud and the grass was literally seeping out under the front door. When I was let in, it appeared that this fifth-floor apartment was being transformed into a complete animal farm, where six or seven cows stood grazing in what otherwise would be the living room. But then in the apartment across the hall from this cow shed lives a newly married couple in what locals describe as one of the nicest apartments in the area.The attention to this detail astonished me, and as the owner of the home so proudly led me around this apartment, from floor to ceiling, every part was decorated. But if it weren't for the strangely familiar stomach-churning odor that constantly passes through the apartment, it would be easy to forget that you are standing next to a cow shed and on top of a landfill. What moved me the most was that despite these seemingly inhospitable conditions, I was welcomed with open arms into a home that was made with love, care, and unreserved passion.Let's move across the map to China, to an area called Shanxi, Henan and Gansu. In a region famous for the soft, porous Loess Plateau soil, there lived until recently an estimated 40 million people in these houses underground. These dwellings are called the yaodongs. Through this architecture by subtraction, these yaodongs are built literally inside of the soil. In these villages, you see an entirely altered landscape, and hidden behind these mounds of dirt are these square, rectangular houses which sit seven meters below the ground. When I asked people why they were digging their houses from the ground, they simply replied that they are poor wheat and apple farmers who didn't have the money to buy materials, and this digging out was their most logical form of living.From Makoko to Zabbaleen, these communities have approached the tasks of planning, design and management of their communities and neighborhoods in ways that respond specifically to their environment and circumstances. Created by these very people who live, work and play in these particular spaces, these neighborhoods are intuitively designed to make the most of their circumstances. In most of these places, the government is completely absent, leaving inhabitants with no choice but to reappropriate found materials, and while these communities are highly disadvantaged, they do present examples of brilliant forms of ingenuity, and prove that indeed we have the ability to adapt to all manner of circumstances. What makes places like the Torre David particularly remarkable is this sort of skeleton framework where people can have a foundation where they can tap into. Now imagine what these already ingenious communities could create themselves, and how highly particular their solutions would be, if they were given the basic infrastructures that they could tap into.Today, you see these large residential development projects which offer cookie-cutter housing solutions to massive amounts of people. From China to Brazil, these projects attempt to provide as many houses as possible, but they're completely generic and simply do not work as an answer to the individual needs of the people.I would like to end with a quote from a friend of mine and a source of inspiration, Zita Cobb, the founder of the wonderful Shorefast Foundation, based out of Fogo Island, Newfoundland. She says that \"there's this plague of sameness which is killing the human joy,\" and I couldn't agree with her more.Thank you.(Applause)", "id": 1846, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:12.243 --> 00:00:15.318\nThroughout my career, I've been fortunate enough\n\n00:00:15.318 --> 00:00:16.677\nto work with many of the great\n\n00:00:16.677 --> 00:00:18.403\ninternational architects,\n\n00:00:18.403 --> 00:00:20.827\ndocumenting their work and observing\n\n00:00:20.827 --> 00:00:22.786\nhow their designs have the capacity\n\n00:00:22.786 --> 00:00:25.755\nto influence the cities in which they sit.\n\n00:00:25.755 --> 00:00:28.598\nI think of new cities like Dubai\n\n00:00:28.598 --> 00:00:31.075\nor ancient cities like Rome\n\n00:00:31.075 --> 00:00:34.437\nwith Zaha Hadid's incredible MAXXI museum,\n\n00:00:34.437 --> 00:00:37.254\nor like right here in New York with the High Line,\n\n00:00:37.254 --> 00:00:39.825\na city which has been so much influenced\n\n00:00:39.825 --> 00:00:41.528\nby the development of this.\n\n00:00:41.528 --> 00:00:43.603\nBut what I find really fascinating\n\n00:00:43.603 --> 00:00:46.699\nis what happens when architects and planners leave\n\n00:00:46.699 --> 00:00:49.818\nand these places become appropriated by people,\n\n00:00:49.818 --> 00:00:52.158\nlike here in Chandigarh, India,\n\n00:00:52.158 --> 00:00:54.478\nthe city which has been completely designed\n\n00:00:54.478 --> 00:00:56.617\nby the architect Le Corbusier.\n\n00:00:56.617 --> 00:00:59.597\nNow 60 years later, the city has been taken over\n\n00:00:59.597 --> 00:01:01.218\nby people in very different ways\n\n00:01:01.218 --> 00:01:04.540\nfrom whatever perhaps intended for,\n\n00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:06.846\nlike here, where you have the people\n\n00:01:06.846 --> 00:01:09.809\nsitting in the windows of the assembly hall.\n\n00:01:09.809 --> 00:01:11.896\nBut over the course of several years,\n\n00:01:11.896 --> 00:01:14.314\nI've been documenting Rem Koolhaas's\n\n00:01:14.314 --> 00:01:16.360\nCCTV building in Beijing\n\n00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:19.198\nand the olympic stadium in the same city\n\n00:01:19.198 --> 00:01:22.342\nby the architects Herzog and de Meuron.\n\n00:01:22.342 --> 00:01:25.787\nAt these large-scale construction sites in China,\n\n00:01:25.787 --> 00:01:27.910\nyou see a sort of makeshift camp\n\n00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:32.100\nwhere workers live during the entire building process.\n\n00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:34.582\nAs the length of the construction takes years,\n\n00:01:34.582 --> 00:01:37.340\nworkers end up forming a rather rough-and-ready\n\n00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:40.606\ninformal city, making for quite a juxtaposition\n\n00:01:40.606 --> 00:01:44.049\nagainst the sophisticated structures that they're building.\n\n00:01:44.049 --> 00:01:46.258\nOver the past seven years, I've been following\n\n00:01:46.258 --> 00:01:48.929\nmy fascination with the built environment,\n\n00:01:48.929 --> 00:01:51.632\nand for those of you who know me, you would say\n\n00:01:51.632 --> 00:01:53.618\nthat this obsession has led me to live\n\n00:01:53.618 --> 00:01:57.040\nout of a suitcase 365 days a year.\n\n00:01:57.040 --> 00:01:59.537\nBeing constantly on the move\n\n00:01:59.537 --> 00:02:01.352\nmeans that sometimes I am able\n\n00:02:01.352 --> 00:02:04.528\nto catch life's most unpredictable moments,\n\n00:02:04.528 --> 00:02:06.509\nlike here in New York\n\n00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:10.902\nthe day after the Sandy storm hit the city.\n\n00:02:10.902 --> 00:02:12.966\nJust over three years ago,\n\n00:02:12.966 --> 00:02:15.652\nI was for the first time in Caracas, Venezuela,\n\n00:02:15.652 --> 00:02:18.448\nand while flying over the city, I was just amazed\n\n00:02:18.448 --> 00:02:20.488\nby the extent to which the slums\n\n00:02:20.488 --> 00:02:22.937\nreach into every corner of the city,\n\n00:02:22.937 --> 00:02:25.674\na place where nearly 70 percent of the population\n\n00:02:25.674 --> 00:02:27.015\nlives in slums,\n\n00:02:27.015 --> 00:02:30.308\ndraped literally all over the mountains.\n\n00:02:30.308 --> 00:02:33.735\nDuring a conversation with local architects Urban-Think Tank,\n\n00:02:33.735 --> 00:02:36.088\nI learned about the Torre David,\n\n00:02:36.088 --> 00:02:38.631\na 45-story office building which sits\n\n00:02:38.631 --> 00:02:40.684\nright in the center of Caracas.\n\n00:02:40.684 --> 00:02:42.287\nThe building was under construction\n\n00:02:42.287 --> 00:02:44.813\nuntil the collapse of the Venezuelan economy\n\n00:02:44.813 --> 00:02:48.179\nand the death of the developer in the early '90s.\n\n00:02:48.179 --> 00:02:51.141\nAbout eight years ago, people started moving\n\n00:02:51.141 --> 00:02:53.154\ninto the abandoned tower\n\n00:02:53.154 --> 00:02:55.173\nand began to build their homes right in between\n\n00:02:55.173 --> 00:02:58.372\nevery column of this unfinished tower.\n\n00:02:58.372 --> 00:03:01.169\nThere's only one little entrance to the entire building,\n\n00:03:01.169 --> 00:03:04.107\nand the 3,000 residents come in and out\n\n00:03:04.107 --> 00:03:06.175\nthrough that single door.\n\n00:03:06.175 --> 00:03:09.064\nTogether, the inhabitants created public spaces\n\n00:03:09.064 --> 00:03:11.337\nand designed them to feel more like a home\n\n00:03:11.337 --> 00:03:13.932\nand less like an unfinished tower.\n\n00:03:13.932 --> 00:03:17.447\nIn the lobby, they painted the walls and planted trees.\n\n00:03:17.447 --> 00:03:20.457\nThey also made a basketball court.\n\n00:03:20.457 --> 00:03:22.157\nBut when you look up closely,\n\n00:03:22.157 --> 00:03:24.638\nyou see massive holes where elevators\n\n00:03:24.638 --> 00:03:27.218\nand services would have run through.\n\n00:03:27.218 --> 00:03:29.207\nWithin the tower, people have come up\n\n00:03:29.207 --> 00:03:31.473\nwith all sorts of solutions\n\n00:03:31.473 --> 00:03:33.454\nin response to the various needs\n\n00:03:33.454 --> 00:03:36.941\nwhich arise from living in an unfinished tower.\n\n00:03:36.941 --> 00:03:38.140\nWith no elevators,\n\n00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:41.468\nthe tower is like a 45-story walkup.\n\n00:03:41.468 --> 00:03:43.718\nDesigned in very specific ways\n\n00:03:43.718 --> 00:03:45.194\nby this group of people\n\n00:03:45.194 --> 00:03:49.090\nwho haven't had any education in architecture or design.\n\n00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:51.371\nAnd with each inhabitant finding their own\n\n00:03:51.371 --> 00:03:53.338\nunique way of coming by,\n\n00:03:53.338 --> 00:03:56.140\nthis tower becomes like a living city,\n\n00:03:56.140 --> 00:03:59.352\na place which is alive with micro-economies\n\n00:03:59.352 --> 00:04:01.269\nand small businesses.\n\n00:04:01.269 --> 00:04:03.883\nThe inventive inhabitants, for instance,\n\n00:04:03.883 --> 00:04:06.614\nfind opportunities in the most unexpected cases,\n\n00:04:06.614 --> 00:04:08.739\nlike the adjacent parking garage,\n\n00:04:08.739 --> 00:04:10.816\nwhich has been reclaimed as a taxi route\n\n00:04:10.816 --> 00:04:13.114\nto shuttle the inhabitants up through the ramps\n\n00:04:13.114 --> 00:04:14.561\nin order to shorten the hike\n\n00:04:14.561 --> 00:04:18.579\nup to the apartments.\n\n00:04:18.579 --> 00:04:20.489\nA walk through the tower\n\n00:04:20.489 --> 00:04:22.599\nreveals how residents have figured out\n\n00:04:22.599 --> 00:04:26.125\nhow to create walls, how to make an air flow,\n\n00:04:26.125 --> 00:04:28.088\nhow to create transparency,\n\n00:04:28.088 --> 00:04:30.512\ncirculation throughout the tower,\n\n00:04:30.512 --> 00:04:32.331\nessentially creating a home\n\n00:04:32.331 --> 00:04:33.979\nthat's completely adapted\n\n00:04:33.979 --> 00:04:37.257\nto the conditions of the site.\n\n00:04:37.257 --> 00:04:39.382\nWhen a new inhabitant moves into the tower,\n\n00:04:39.382 --> 00:04:41.290\nthey already have a roof over their head,\n\n00:04:41.290 --> 00:04:43.329\nso they just typically mark their space\n\n00:04:43.329 --> 00:04:46.245\nwith a few curtains or sheets.\n\n00:04:46.245 --> 00:04:49.417\nSlowly, from found materials, walls rise,\n\n00:04:49.417 --> 00:04:52.340\nand people create a space out of any found objects\n\n00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:54.229\nor materials.\n\n00:04:54.229 --> 00:04:56.729\nIt's remarkable to see the design decisions\n\n00:04:56.729 --> 00:04:58.405\nthat they're making,\n\n00:04:58.405 --> 00:05:01.040\nlike when everything is made out of red bricks,\n\n00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:03.305\nsome residents will cover that red brick\n\n00:05:03.305 --> 00:05:07.166\nwith another layer of red brick-patterned wallpaper\n\n00:05:07.166 --> 00:05:12.218\njust to make it a kind of clean finish.\n\n00:05:12.218 --> 00:05:14.677\nThe inhabitants literally built up these homes\n\n00:05:14.677 --> 00:05:16.834\nwith their own hands, and this labor of love\n\n00:05:16.834 --> 00:05:18.587\ninstills a great sense of pride\n\n00:05:18.587 --> 00:05:21.839\nin many families living in this tower.\n\n00:05:21.839 --> 00:05:24.773\nThey typically make the best out of their conditions,\n\n00:05:24.773 --> 00:05:27.581\nand try to make their spaces look nice and homey,\n\n00:05:27.581 --> 00:05:31.128\nor at least up until as far as they can reach.\n\n00:05:31.128 --> 00:05:34.140\nThroughout the tower, you come across\n\n00:05:34.140 --> 00:05:36.306\nall kinds of services, like the barber,\n\n00:05:36.306 --> 00:05:40.119\nsmall factories, and every floor has\n\n00:05:40.119 --> 00:05:43.543\na little grocery store or shop.\n\n00:05:43.543 --> 00:05:46.053\nAnd you even find a church.\n\n00:05:46.053 --> 00:05:48.417\nAnd on the 30th floor, there is a gym\n\n00:05:48.417 --> 00:05:50.171\nwhere all the weights and barbells\n\n00:05:50.171 --> 00:05:51.967\nare made out of the leftover pulleys\n\n00:05:51.967 --> 00:05:55.377\nfrom the elevators which were never installed.\n\n00:05:55.377 --> 00:05:58.012\nFrom the outside, behind this always-changing facade,\n\n00:05:58.012 --> 00:05:59.631\nyou see how the fixed concrete beams\n\n00:05:59.631 --> 00:06:01.496\nprovide a framework for the inhabitants\n\n00:06:01.496 --> 00:06:02.963\nto create their homes\n\n00:06:02.963 --> 00:06:04.839\nin an organic, intuitive way\n\n00:06:04.839 --> 00:06:07.556\nthat responds directly to their needs.\n\n00:06:07.556 --> 00:06:10.211\nLet's go now to Africa, to Nigeria,\n\n00:06:10.211 --> 00:06:12.782\nto a community called Makoko,\n\n00:06:12.782 --> 00:06:15.341\na slum where 150,000 people\n\n00:06:15.341 --> 00:06:18.523\nlive just meters above the Lagos Lagoon.\n\n00:06:18.523 --> 00:06:22.237\nWhile it may appear to be a completely chaotic place,\n\n00:06:22.237 --> 00:06:24.643\nwhen you see it from above, there seems to be\n\n00:06:24.643 --> 00:06:27.808\na whole grid of waterways and canals\n\n00:06:27.808 --> 00:06:30.322\nconnecting each and every home.\n\n00:06:30.322 --> 00:06:34.536\nFrom the main dock, people board long wooden canoes\n\n00:06:34.536 --> 00:06:37.206\nwhich carry them out to their various homes and shops\n\n00:06:37.206 --> 00:06:39.881\nlocated in the expansive area.\n\n00:06:39.881 --> 00:06:41.828\nWhen out on the water, it's clear\n\n00:06:41.828 --> 00:06:43.717\nthat life has been completely adapted\n\n00:06:43.717 --> 00:06:46.356\nto this very specific way of living.\n\n00:06:46.356 --> 00:06:49.003\nEven the canoes become variety stores\n\n00:06:49.003 --> 00:06:50.943\nwhere ladies paddle from house to house,\n\n00:06:50.943 --> 00:06:55.059\nselling anything from toothpaste to fresh fruits.\n\n00:06:55.059 --> 00:06:57.078\nBehind every window and door frame,\n\n00:06:57.078 --> 00:06:59.781\nyou'll see a small child peering back at you,\n\n00:06:59.781 --> 00:07:02.765\nand while Makoko seems to be packed with people,\n\n00:07:02.765 --> 00:07:04.600\nwhat's more shocking is actually\n\n00:07:04.600 --> 00:07:08.085\nthe amount of children pouring out of every building.\n\n00:07:08.085 --> 00:07:10.065\nThe population growth in Nigeria,\n\n00:07:10.065 --> 00:07:12.534\nand especially in these areas like Makoko,\n\n00:07:12.534 --> 00:07:14.686\nare painful reminders\n\n00:07:14.686 --> 00:07:18.925\nof how out of control things really are.\n\n00:07:18.925 --> 00:07:21.204\nIn Makoko, very few systems\n\n00:07:21.204 --> 00:07:23.070\nand infrastructures exist.\n\n00:07:23.070 --> 00:07:26.002\nElectricity is rigged and freshest water\n\n00:07:26.002 --> 00:07:29.367\ncomes from self-built wells throughout the area.\n\n00:07:29.367 --> 00:07:31.771\nThis entire economic model\n\n00:07:31.771 --> 00:07:34.563\nis designed to meet a specific way of living\n\n00:07:34.563 --> 00:07:37.678\non the water, so fishing and boat-making\n\n00:07:37.678 --> 00:07:39.453\nare common professions.\n\n00:07:39.453 --> 00:07:41.420\nYou'll have a set of entrepreneurs\n\n00:07:41.420 --> 00:07:44.444\nwho have set up businesses throughout the area,\n\n00:07:44.444 --> 00:07:49.244\nlike barbershops, CD and DVD stores,\n\n00:07:49.244 --> 00:07:54.607\nmovie theaters, tailors, everything is there.\n\n00:07:54.607 --> 00:07:56.402\nThere is even a photo studio\n\n00:07:56.402 --> 00:07:58.159\nwhere you see the sort of aspiration\n\n00:07:58.159 --> 00:08:01.459\nto live in a real house or to be associated\n\n00:08:01.459 --> 00:08:05.758\nwith a faraway place, like that hotel in Sweden.\n\n00:08:05.758 --> 00:08:07.382\nOn this particular evening,\n\n00:08:07.382 --> 00:08:09.486\nI came across this live band\n\n00:08:09.486 --> 00:08:12.637\ndressed to the T in their coordinating outfits.\n\n00:08:12.637 --> 00:08:14.667\nThey were floating through the canals\n\n00:08:14.667 --> 00:08:17.591\nin a large canoe with a fitted-out generator\n\n00:08:17.591 --> 00:08:21.927\nfor all of the community to enjoy.\n\n00:08:21.927 --> 00:08:24.918\nBy nightfall, the area becomes almost pitch black,\n\n00:08:24.918 --> 00:08:26.746\nsave for a small lightbulb\n\n00:08:26.746 --> 00:08:29.480\nor a fire.\n\n00:08:29.480 --> 00:08:32.095\nWhat originally brought me to Makoko\n\n00:08:32.095 --> 00:08:33.902\nwas this project from a friend of mine,\n\n00:08:33.902 --> 00:08:36.703\nKunl\u00e9 Adeyemi, who recently finished building\n\n00:08:36.703 --> 00:08:38.749\nthis three-story floating school\n\n00:08:38.749 --> 00:08:40.770\nfor the kids in Makoko.\n\n00:08:40.770 --> 00:08:43.799\nWith this entire village existing on the water,\n\n00:08:43.799 --> 00:08:46.222\npublic space is very limited,\n\n00:08:46.222 --> 00:08:47.886\nso now that the school is finished,\n\n00:08:47.886 --> 00:08:51.260\nthe ground floor is a playground for the kids,\n\n00:08:51.260 --> 00:08:53.127\nbut when classes are out, the platform\n\n00:08:53.127 --> 00:08:54.698\nis just like a town square,\n\n00:08:54.698 --> 00:08:57.093\nwhere the fishermen mend their nets\n\n00:08:57.093 --> 00:09:01.258\nand floating shopkeepers dock their boats.\n\n00:09:01.258 --> 00:09:03.788\nAnother place I'd like to share with you\n\n00:09:03.788 --> 00:09:05.836\nis the Zabbaleen in Cairo.\n\n00:09:05.836 --> 00:09:08.595\nThey're descendants of farmers who began migrating\n\n00:09:08.595 --> 00:09:11.065\nfrom the upper Egypt in the '40s,\n\n00:09:11.065 --> 00:09:12.491\nand today they make their living\n\n00:09:12.491 --> 00:09:15.681\nby collecting and recycling waste from homes\n\n00:09:15.681 --> 00:09:17.932\nfrom all over Cairo.\n\n00:09:17.932 --> 00:09:21.054\nFor years, the Zabbaleen would live in makeshift villages\n\n00:09:21.054 --> 00:09:22.723\nwhere they would move around\n\n00:09:22.723 --> 00:09:25.242\ntrying to avoid the local authorities,\n\n00:09:25.242 --> 00:09:27.561\nbut in the early 1980s, they settled\n\n00:09:27.561 --> 00:09:29.278\non the Mokattam rocks\n\n00:09:29.278 --> 00:09:31.927\njust at the eastern edge of the city.\n\n00:09:31.927 --> 00:09:33.958\nToday, they live in this area,\n\n00:09:33.958 --> 00:09:36.762\napproximately 50,000 to 70,000 people,\n\n00:09:36.762 --> 00:09:38.895\nwho live in this community of self-built\n\n00:09:38.895 --> 00:09:41.075\nmulti-story houses\n\n00:09:41.075 --> 00:09:45.368\nwhere up to three generations live in one structure.\n\n00:09:45.368 --> 00:09:47.846\nWhile these apartments that they built for themselves\n\n00:09:47.846 --> 00:09:50.831\nappear to lack any planning or formal grid,\n\n00:09:50.831 --> 00:09:54.237\neach family specializing in a certain form of recycling\n\n00:09:54.237 --> 00:09:56.470\nmeans that the ground floor of each apartment\n\n00:09:56.470 --> 00:10:00.127\nis reserved for garbage-related activities\n\n00:10:00.127 --> 00:10:04.150\nand the upper floor is dedicated to living space.\n\n00:10:04.150 --> 00:10:06.021\nI find it incredible to see\n\n00:10:06.021 --> 00:10:07.957\nhow these piles and piles of garbage\n\n00:10:07.957 --> 00:10:10.468\nare invisible to the people who live there,\n\n00:10:10.468 --> 00:10:13.868\nlike this very distinguished man who is posing\n\n00:10:13.868 --> 00:10:18.077\nwhile all this garbage is sort of streaming out behind him,\n\n00:10:18.077 --> 00:10:20.717\nor like these two young men who are sitting\n\n00:10:20.717 --> 00:10:25.569\nand chatting amongst these tons of garbage.\n\n00:10:25.569 --> 00:10:27.302\nWhile to most of us, living amongst\n\n00:10:27.302 --> 00:10:29.390\nthese piles and piles of garbage\n\n00:10:29.390 --> 00:10:31.741\nmay seem totally uninhabitable,\n\n00:10:31.741 --> 00:10:33.831\nto those in the Zabbaleen, this is just\n\n00:10:33.831 --> 00:10:36.310\na different type of normal.\n\n00:10:36.310 --> 00:10:38.947\nIn all these places I've talked about today,\n\n00:10:38.947 --> 00:10:41.068\nwhat I do find fascinating is that there's really\n\n00:10:41.068 --> 00:10:42.666\nno such thing as normal,\n\n00:10:42.666 --> 00:10:44.871\nand it proves that people are able to adapt\n\n00:10:44.871 --> 00:10:47.246\nto any kind of situation.\n\n00:10:47.246 --> 00:10:48.762\nThroughout the day, it's quite common\n\n00:10:48.762 --> 00:10:52.110\nto come across a small party taking place\n\n00:10:52.110 --> 00:10:55.954\nin the streets, just like this engagement party.\n\n00:10:55.954 --> 00:10:57.941\nIn this tradition, the bride-to-be\n\n00:10:57.941 --> 00:11:00.086\ndisplays all of their belongings,\n\n00:11:00.086 --> 00:11:02.280\nwhich they soon bring to their new husband.\n\n00:11:02.280 --> 00:11:04.311\nA gathering like this one\n\n00:11:04.311 --> 00:11:06.208\noffers such a juxtaposition\n\n00:11:06.208 --> 00:11:08.986\nwhere all the new stuff is displayed\n\n00:11:08.986 --> 00:11:11.352\nand all the garbage is used\n\n00:11:11.352 --> 00:11:17.989\nas props to display all their new home accessories.\n\n00:11:17.989 --> 00:11:20.155\nLike Makoko and the Torre David,\n\n00:11:20.155 --> 00:11:21.700\nthroughout the Zabbaleen you'll find all\n\n00:11:21.700 --> 00:11:24.844\nthe same facilities as in any typical neighborhood.\n\n00:11:24.844 --> 00:11:26.924\nThere are the retail shops, the cafes\n\n00:11:26.924 --> 00:11:29.244\nand the restaurants, and the community\n\n00:11:29.244 --> 00:11:32.185\nis this community of Coptic Christians,\n\n00:11:32.185 --> 00:11:34.424\nso you'll also find a church,\n\n00:11:34.424 --> 00:11:37.869\nalong with the scores of religious iconographies\n\n00:11:37.869 --> 00:11:39.627\nthroughout the area,\n\n00:11:39.627 --> 00:11:42.816\nand also all the everyday services\n\n00:11:42.816 --> 00:11:44.615\nlike the electronic repair shops,\n\n00:11:44.615 --> 00:11:47.703\nthe barbers, everything.\n\n00:11:47.703 --> 00:11:49.876\nVisiting the homes of the Zabbaleen\n\n00:11:49.876 --> 00:11:51.565\nis also full of surprises.\n\n00:11:51.565 --> 00:11:53.077\nWhile from the outside,\n\n00:11:53.077 --> 00:11:55.620\nthese homes look like any other informal structure\n\n00:11:55.620 --> 00:11:57.938\nin the city, when you step inside,\n\n00:11:57.938 --> 00:12:01.801\nyou are met with all manner of design decisions\n\n00:12:01.801 --> 00:12:04.068\nand interior decoration.\n\n00:12:04.068 --> 00:12:07.232\nDespite having limited access to space and money,\n\n00:12:07.232 --> 00:12:09.111\nthe homes in the area are designed\n\n00:12:09.111 --> 00:12:11.097\nwith care and detail.\n\n00:12:11.097 --> 00:12:13.140\nEvery apartment is unique,\n\n00:12:13.140 --> 00:12:14.933\nand this individuality tells a story\n\n00:12:14.933 --> 00:12:18.059\nabout each family's circumstances and values.\n\n00:12:18.059 --> 00:12:20.205\nMany of these people take their homes\n\n00:12:20.205 --> 00:12:23.373\nand interior spaces very seriously,\n\n00:12:23.373 --> 00:12:24.880\nputting a lot of work and care\n\n00:12:24.880 --> 00:12:26.206\ninto the details.\n\n00:12:26.206 --> 00:12:29.379\nThe shared spaces are also treated in the same manner,\n\n00:12:29.379 --> 00:12:33.236\nwhere walls are decorated in faux marble patterns.\n\n00:12:33.236 --> 00:12:36.219\nBut despite this elaborate decor,\n\n00:12:36.219 --> 00:12:38.773\nsometimes these apartments are used\n\n00:12:38.773 --> 00:12:40.583\nin very unexpected ways,\n\n00:12:40.583 --> 00:12:42.963\nlike this home which caught my attention\n\n00:12:42.963 --> 00:12:46.445\nwhile all the mud and the grass was literally\n\n00:12:46.445 --> 00:12:48.932\nseeping out under the front door.\n\n00:12:48.932 --> 00:12:52.731\nWhen I was let in, it appeared that this fifth-floor apartment\n\n00:12:52.731 --> 00:12:56.039\nwas being transformed into a complete animal farm,\n\n00:12:56.039 --> 00:12:58.930\nwhere six or seven cows stood grazing\n\n00:12:58.930 --> 00:13:03.602\nin what otherwise would be the living room.\n\n00:13:03.602 --> 00:13:06.970\nBut then in the apartment across the hall\n\n00:13:06.970 --> 00:13:09.493\nfrom this cow shed lives a newly married couple\n\n00:13:09.493 --> 00:13:11.319\nin what locals describe\n\n00:13:11.319 --> 00:13:19.440\nas one of the nicest apartments in the area.\n\n00:13:19.440 --> 00:13:22.666\nThe attention to this detail astonished me,\n\n00:13:22.666 --> 00:13:25.337\nand as the owner of the home so proudly\n\n00:13:25.337 --> 00:13:27.323\nled me around this apartment,\n\n00:13:27.323 --> 00:13:31.039\nfrom floor to ceiling, every part was decorated.\n\n00:13:31.039 --> 00:13:34.841\nBut if it weren't for the strangely familiar\n\n00:13:34.841 --> 00:13:37.704\nstomach-churning odor that constantly\n\n00:13:37.704 --> 00:13:41.149\npasses through the apartment,\n\n00:13:41.149 --> 00:13:43.742\nit would be easy to forget\n\n00:13:43.742 --> 00:13:46.434\nthat you are standing next to a cow shed\n\n00:13:46.434 --> 00:13:51.931\nand on top of a landfill.\n\n00:13:51.931 --> 00:13:54.610\nWhat moved me the most was that despite\n\n00:13:54.610 --> 00:13:56.644\nthese seemingly inhospitable conditions,\n\n00:13:56.644 --> 00:13:58.437\nI was welcomed with open arms\n\n00:13:58.437 --> 00:14:02.363\ninto a home that was made with love, care,\n\n00:14:02.363 --> 00:14:04.613\nand unreserved passion.\n\n00:14:04.613 --> 00:14:07.997\nLet's move across the map to China,\n\n00:14:07.997 --> 00:14:11.884\nto an area called Shanxi, Henan and Gansu.\n\n00:14:11.884 --> 00:14:15.574\nIn a region famous for the soft, porous Loess Plateau soil,\n\n00:14:15.574 --> 00:14:18.257\nthere lived until recently an estimated\n\n00:14:18.257 --> 00:14:22.126\n40 million people in these houses underground.\n\n00:14:22.126 --> 00:14:24.577\nThese dwellings are called the yaodongs.\n\n00:14:24.577 --> 00:14:26.767\nThrough this architecture by subtraction,\n\n00:14:26.767 --> 00:14:30.354\nthese yaodongs are built literally inside of the soil.\n\n00:14:30.354 --> 00:14:34.228\nIn these villages, you see an entirely altered landscape,\n\n00:14:34.228 --> 00:14:36.974\nand hidden behind these mounds of dirt\n\n00:14:36.974 --> 00:14:39.474\nare these square, rectangular houses\n\n00:14:39.474 --> 00:14:42.065\nwhich sit seven meters below the ground.\n\n00:14:42.065 --> 00:14:44.053\nWhen I asked people why they were digging\n\n00:14:44.053 --> 00:14:45.942\ntheir houses from the ground,\n\n00:14:45.942 --> 00:14:47.965\nthey simply replied that they are poor wheat\n\n00:14:47.965 --> 00:14:50.145\nand apple farmers who didn't have the money\n\n00:14:50.145 --> 00:14:53.546\nto buy materials, and this digging out\n\n00:14:53.546 --> 00:14:58.014\nwas their most logical form of living.\n\n00:14:58.014 --> 00:15:00.912\nFrom Makoko to Zabbaleen, these communities\n\n00:15:00.912 --> 00:15:02.911\nhave approached the tasks of planning,\n\n00:15:02.911 --> 00:15:05.310\ndesign and management of their communities\n\n00:15:05.310 --> 00:15:07.689\nand neighborhoods in ways that respond\n\n00:15:07.689 --> 00:15:11.599\nspecifically to their environment and circumstances.\n\n00:15:11.599 --> 00:15:13.830\nCreated by these very people who live,\n\n00:15:13.830 --> 00:15:17.541\nwork and play in these particular spaces,\n\n00:15:17.541 --> 00:15:20.538\nthese neighborhoods are intuitively designed\n\n00:15:20.538 --> 00:15:23.576\nto make the most of their circumstances.\n\n00:15:23.576 --> 00:15:25.481\nIn most of these places, the government\n\n00:15:25.481 --> 00:15:28.010\nis completely absent, leaving inhabitants\n\n00:15:28.010 --> 00:15:31.929\nwith no choice but to reappropriate found materials,\n\n00:15:31.929 --> 00:15:34.901\nand while these communities are highly disadvantaged,\n\n00:15:34.901 --> 00:15:36.943\nthey do present examples\n\n00:15:36.943 --> 00:15:39.391\nof brilliant forms of ingenuity,\n\n00:15:39.391 --> 00:15:41.719\nand prove that indeed we have the ability\n\n00:15:41.719 --> 00:15:45.262\nto adapt to all manner of circumstances.\n\n00:15:45.262 --> 00:15:47.455\nWhat makes places like the Torre David\n\n00:15:47.455 --> 00:15:49.252\nparticularly remarkable\n\n00:15:49.252 --> 00:15:51.153\nis this sort of skeleton framework\n\n00:15:51.153 --> 00:15:52.775\nwhere people can have a foundation\n\n00:15:52.775 --> 00:15:54.847\nwhere they can tap into.\n\n00:15:54.847 --> 00:15:57.945\nNow imagine what these already ingenious communities\n\n00:15:57.945 --> 00:16:00.037\ncould create themselves,\n\n00:16:00.037 --> 00:16:02.723\nand how highly particular their solutions would be,\n\n00:16:02.723 --> 00:16:05.265\nif they were given the basic infrastructures\n\n00:16:05.265 --> 00:16:07.244\nthat they could tap into.\n\n00:16:07.244 --> 00:16:10.751\nToday, you see these large residential development projects\n\n00:16:10.751 --> 00:16:13.206\nwhich offer cookie-cutter housing solutions\n\n00:16:13.206 --> 00:16:15.248\nto massive amounts of people.\n\n00:16:15.248 --> 00:16:17.808\nFrom China to Brazil, these projects attempt\n\n00:16:17.808 --> 00:16:20.815\nto provide as many houses as possible,\n\n00:16:20.815 --> 00:16:23.018\nbut they're completely generic\n\n00:16:23.018 --> 00:16:24.923\nand simply do not work as an answer\n\n00:16:24.923 --> 00:16:28.252\nto the individual needs of the people.\n\n00:16:28.252 --> 00:16:30.706\nI would like to end with a quote\n\n00:16:30.706 --> 00:16:33.787\nfrom a friend of mine and a source of inspiration,\n\n00:16:33.787 --> 00:16:36.553\nZita Cobb, the founder of the wonderful\n\n00:16:36.553 --> 00:16:38.229\nShorefast Foundation,\n\n00:16:38.229 -->

joy,\"\n\n00:16:46.082 --> 00:16:48.377\nand I couldn't agree with her more.\n\n00:16:48.377 --> 00:16:49.820\nThank you.\n\n00:16:49.820 --> 00:16:53.782\n(Applause)"}, {"title": "What will a future

privacy incident involving Adam and Eve, and the remarkable shift in the boundaries between public and private which has occurred in the past 10 years.You know the incident. Adam and Eve one day in the Garden of Eden realize they are naked. They freak out. And the rest is history.Nowadays, Adam and Eve would probably act differently.[@Adam Last nite was a blast! loved dat apple LOL][@Eve yep.. babe, know what happened to my pants tho?]We do reveal so much more information about ourselves online than ever before, and so much information about us is being collected by organizations. Now there is much to gain and benefit from this massive analysis of personal information, or big data, but there are also complex tradeoffs that come from giving away our privacy. And my story is about these tradeoffs.We start with an observation which, in my mind, has become clearer and clearer in the past few years, that any personal information can become sensitive information. Back in the year 2000, about 100 billion photos were shot worldwide, but only a minuscule proportion of them were actually uploaded online. In 2010, only on Facebook, in a single month, 2.5 billion photos were uploaded, most of them identified. In the same span of time, computers' ability to recognize people in photos improved by three orders of magnitude. What happens when you combine these technologies together: increasing availability of facial data; improving facial recognizing ability by computers; but also cloud computing, which gives anyone in this theater the kind of computational power which a few years ago was only the domain of three-letter agencies; and ubiquitous computing, which allows my phone, which is not a supercomputer, to connect to the Internet and do there hundreds of thousands of face metrics in a few seconds? Well, we conjecture that the result of this combination of technologies will be a radical change in our very notions of privacy and anonymity.To test that, we did an experiment on Carnegie Mellon University campus. We asked students who were walking by to participate in a study, and we took a shot with a webcam, and we asked them to fill out a survey on a laptop. While they were filling out the survey, we uploaded their shot to a cloud-computing cluster, and we started using a facial recognizer to match that shot to a database of some hundreds of thousands of images which we had downloaded from Facebook profiles. By the time the subject reached the last page on the survey, the page had been dynamically updated with the 10 best matching photos which the recognizer had found, and we asked the subjects to indicate whether he or she found themselves in the photo.Do you see the subject? Well, the computer did, and in fact did so for one out of three subjects.So essentially, we can start from an anonymous face, offline or online, and we can use facial recognition to give a name to that anonymous face thanks to social media data. But a few years back, we did something else. We started from social media data, we combined it statistically with data from U.S. government social security, and we ended up predicting social security numbers, which in the United States are extremely sensitive information.Do you see where I'm going with this? So if you combine the two studies together, then the question becomes, can you start from a face and, using facial recognition, find a name and publicly available information about that name and that person, and from that publicly available information infer non-publicly available information, much more sensitive ones which you link back to the face? And the answer is, yes, we can, and we did. Of course, the accuracy keeps getting worse. [27% of subjects' first 5 SSN digits identified (with 4 attempts)] But in fact, we even decided to develop an iPhone app which uses the phone's internal camera to take a shot of a subject and then upload it to a cloud and then do what I just described to you in real time: looking for a match, finding public information, trying to infer sensitive information, and then sending back to the phone so that it is overlaid on the face of the subject, an example of augmented reality, probably a creepy example of augmented reality. In fact, we didn't develop the app to make it available, just as a proof of concept.In fact, take these technologies and push them to their logical extreme. Imagine a future in which strangers around you will look at you through their Google Glasses or, one day, their contact lenses, and use seven or eight data points about you to infer anything else which may be known about you. What will this future without secrets look like? And should we care?We may like to believe that the future with so much wealth of data would be a future with no more biases, but in fact, having so much information doesn't mean that we will make decisions which are more objective. In another experiment, we presented to our subjects information about a potential job candidate. We included in this information some references to some funny, absolutely legal, but perhaps slightly embarrassing information that the subject had posted online. Now interestingly, among our subjects, some had posted comparable information, and some had not. Which group do you think was more likely to judge harshly our subject? Paradoxically, it was the group who had posted similar information, an example of moral dissonance.Now you may be thinking, this does not apply to me, because I have nothing to hide. But in fact, privacy is not about having something negative to hide. Imagine that you are the H.R. director of a certain organization, and you receive r\u00e9sum\u00e9s, and you decide to find more information about the candidates. Therefore, you Google their names and in a certain universe, you find this information. Or in a parallel universe, you find this information. Do you think that you would be equally likely to call either candidate for an interview? If you think so, then you are not like the U.S. employers who are, in fact, part of our experiment, meaning we did exactly that. We created Facebook profiles, manipulating traits, then we started sending out r\u00e9sum\u00e9s to companies in the U.S., and we detected, we monitored, whether they were searching for our candidates, and whether they were acting on the information they found on social media. And they were. Discrimination was happening through social media for equally skilled candidates.Now marketers like us to believe that all information about us will always be used in a manner which is in our favor. But think again. Why should that be always the case? In a movie which came out a few years ago, \"Minority Report,\" a famous scene had Tom Cruise walk in a mall and holographic personalized advertising would appear around him. Now, that movie is set in 2054, about 40 years from now, and as exciting as that technology looks, it already vastly underestimates the amount of information that organizations can gather about you, and how they can use it to influence you in a way that you will not even detect.So as an example, this is another experiment actually we are running, not yet completed. Imagine that an organization has access to your list of Facebook friends, and through some kind of algorithm they can detect the two friends that you like the most. And then they create, in real time, a facial composite of these two friends. Now studies prior to ours have shown that people don't recognize any longer even themselves in facial composites, but they react to those composites in a positive manner. So next time you are looking for a certain product, and there is an ad suggesting you to buy it, it will not be just a standard spokesperson. It will be one of your friends, and you will not even know that this is happening.Now the problem is that the current policy mechanisms we have to protect ourselves from the abuses of personal information are like bringing a knife to a gunfight. One of these mechanisms is transparency, telling people what you are going to do with their data. And in principle, that's a very good thing. It's necessary, but it is not sufficient. Transparency can be misdirected. You can tell people what you are going to do, and then you still nudge them to disclose arbitrary amounts of personal information.So in yet another experiment, this one with students, we asked them to provide information about their campus behavior, including pretty sensitive questions, such as this one. [Have you ever cheated in an exam?] Now to one group of subjects, we told them, \"Only other students will see your answers.\" To another group of subjects, we told them, \"Students and faculty will see your answers.\" Transparency. Notification. And sure enough, this worked, in the sense that the first group of subjects were much more likely to disclose than the second. It makes sense, right? But then we added the misdirection. We repeated the experiment with the same two groups, this time adding a delay between the time we told subjects how we would use their data and the time we actually started answering the questions.How long a delay do you think we had to add in order to nullify the inhibitory effect of knowing that faculty would see your answers? Ten minutes? Five minutes? One minute? How about 15 seconds? Fifteen seconds were sufficient to have the two groups disclose the same amount of information, as if the second group now no longer cares for faculty reading their answers.Now I have to admit that this talk so far may sound exceedingly gloomy, but that is not my point. In fact, I want to share with you the fact that there are alternatives. The way we are doing things now is not the only way they can done, and certainly not the best way they can be done. When someone tells you, \"People don't care about privacy,\" consider whether the game has been designed and rigged so that they cannot care about privacy, and coming to the realization that these manipulations occur is already halfway through the process of being able to protect yourself. When someone tells you that privacy is incompatible with the benefits of big data, consider that in the last 20 years, researchers have created technologies to allow virtually any electronic transactions to take place in a more privacy-preserving manner. We can browse the Internet anonymously. We can send emails that can only be read by the intended recipient, not even the NSA. We can have even privacy-preserving data mining. In other words, we can have the benefits of big data while protecting privacy. Of course, these technologies imply a shifting of cost and revenues between data holders and data subjects, which is why, perhaps, you don't hear more about them.Which brings me back to the Garden of Eden. There is a second privacy interpretation of the story of the Garden of Eden which doesn't have to do with the issue of Adam and Eve feeling naked and feeling ashamed. You can find echoes of this interpretation in John Milton's \"Paradise Lost.\" In the garden, Adam and Eve are materially content. They're happy. They are satisfied. However, they also lack knowledge and self-awareness. The moment they eat the aptly named fruit of knowledge, that's when they discover themselves. They become aware. They achieve autonomy. The price to pay, however, is leaving the garden. So privacy, in a way, is both the means and the price to pay for freedom.Again, marketers tell us that big data and social media are not just a paradise of profit for them, but a Garden of Eden for the rest of us. We get free content. We get to play Angry Birds. We get targeted apps. But in fact, in a few years, organizations will know so much about us, they will be able to infer our desires before we even form them, and perhaps buy products on our behalf before we even know we need them.Now there was one English author who anticipated this kind of future where we would trade away our autonomy and freedom for comfort. Even more so than George Orwell, the author is, of course, Aldous Huxley. In \"Brave New World,\" he imagines a society where technologies that we created originally for freedom end up coercing us. However, in the book, he also offers us a way out of that society, similar to the path that Adam and Eve had to follow to leave the garden. In the words of the Savage, regaining autonomy and freedom is possible, although the price to pay is steep. So I do believe that one of the defining fights of our times will be the fight for the control over personal information, the fight over whether big data will become a force for freedom, rather than a force which will hiddenly manipulate us.Right now, many of us do not even know that the fight is going on, but it is, whether you like it or not. And at the risk of playing the serpent, I will tell you that the tools for the fight are here, the awareness of what is going on, and in your hands, just a few clicks away.Thank you.(Applause)", "id":

00:01:21.460\nhas become clearer and clearer in the past few years,\n\n00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:23.557\nthat any personal information\n\n00:01:23.557 --> 00:01:25.842\ncan become sensitive information.\n\n00:01:25.842 --> 00:01:29.967\nBack in the year 2000, about 100 billion photos\n\n00:01:29.967 --> 00:01:31.879\nwere shot worldwide,\n\n00:01:31.879 --> 00:01:34.944\nbut only a minuscule proportion of them\n\n00:01:34.944 --> 00:01:36.827\nwere actually uploaded online.\n\n00:01:36.827 --> 00:01:40.188\nIn 2010, only on Facebook, in a single month,\n\n00:01:40.188 --> 00:01:43.458\n2.5 billion photos were uploaded,\n\n00:01:43.458 --> 00:01:45.340\nmost of them identified.\n\n00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:47.220\nIn the same span of time,\n\n00:01:47.220 -->

kind of computational power\n\n00:02:11.017 --> 00:02:12.903\nwhich a few years ago was only the domain\n\n00:02:12.903 --> 00:02:14.685\nof three-letter agencies;\n\n00:02:14.685 -->

that the result\n\n00:02:28.227 --> 00:02:30.291\nof this combination of technologies\n\n00:02:30.291 --> 00:02:33.179\nwill be a radical change in our very notions\n\n00:02:33.179 --> 00:02:35.436\nof privacy and anonymity.\n\n00:02:35.436 --> 00:02:37.429\nTo test that, we did an experiment\n\n00:02:37.429 --> 00:02:39.550\non Carnegie Mellon University campus.\n\n00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:41.649\nWe asked students who were walking by\n\n00:02:41.649 --> 00:02:43.428\nto participate in a study,\n\n00:02:43.428 --> 00:02:45.990\nand we took a shot with a webcam,\n\n00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:48.772\nand we asked them to fill out a survey on a laptop.\n\n00:02:48.772 --> 00:02:50.751\nWhile they were filling out the survey,\n\n00:02:50.751 --> 00:02:53.548\nwe uploaded their shot to a cloud-computing cluster,\n\n00:02:53.548 --> 00:02:55.275\nand we started using a facial recognizer\n\n00:02:55.275 --> 00:02:57.680\nto match that shot to a database\n\n00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:00.073\nof some hundreds of thousands of images\n\n00:03:00.073 --> 00:03:03.669\nwhich we had downloaded from Facebook profiles.\n\n00:03:03.669 --> 00:03:06.928\nBy the time the subject reached the last page\n\n00:03:06.928 --> 00:03:10.275\non the survey, the page had been dynamically updated\n\n00:03:10.275 --> 00:03:12.588\nwith the 10 best matching photos\n\n00:03:12.588 --> 00:03:14.873\nwhich the recognizer had found,\n\n00:03:14.873 --> 00:03:16.611\nand we asked the subjects to indicate\n\n00:03:16.611 --> 00:03:20.731\nwhether he or she found themselves in the photo.\n\n00:03:20.731 --> 00:03:24.430\nDo you see the subject?\n\n00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:27.275\nWell, the computer did, and in fact did so\n\n00:03:27.275 --> 00:03:29.424\nfor one out of three subjects.\n\n00:03:29.424 --> 00:03:32.608\nSo essentially, we can start from an anonymous face,\n\n00:03:32.608 --> 00:03:36.092\noffline or online, and we can use facial recognition\n\n00:03:36.092 --> 00:03:38.452\nto give a name to that anonymous face\n\n00:03:38.452 --> 00:03:40.560\nthanks to social media data.\n\n00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:42.432\nBut a few years back, we did something else.\n\n00:03:42.432 --> 00:03:44.255\nWe started from social media data,\n\n00:03:44.255 --> 00:03:47.306\nwe combined it statistically with data\n\n00:03:47.306 --> 00:03:49.408\nfrom U.S. government social security,\n\n00:03:49.408 --> 00:03:52.732\nand we ended up predicting social security numbers,\n\n00:03:52.732 --> 00:03:54.244\nwhich in the United States\n\n00:03:54.244 --> 00:03:56.284\nare extremely sensitive information.\n\n00:03:56.284 --> 00:03:58.377\nDo you see where I'm going with this?\n\n00:03:58.377 --> 00:04:01.299\nSo if you combine the two studies together,\n\n00:04:01.299 --> 00:04:02.811\nthen the question becomes,\n\n00:04:02.811 --> 00:04:05.531\ncan you start from a face and,\n\n00:04:05.531 --> 00:04:07.842\nusing facial recognition, find a name\n\n00:04:07.842 --> 00:04:10.511\nand publicly available information\n\n00:04:10.511 --> 00:04:12.443\nabout that name and that person,\n\n00:04:12.443 --> 00:04:14.691\nand from that publicly available information\n\n00:04:14.691 --> 00:04:16.733\ninfer non-publicly available information,\n\n00:04:16.733 --> 00:04:18.339\nmuch more sensitive ones\n\n00:04:18.339 --> 00:04:19.831\nwhich you link back to the face?\n\n00:04:19.831 --> 00:04:21.747\nAnd the answer is, yes, we can, and we did.\n\n00:04:21.747 --> 00:04:24.315\nOf course, the accuracy keeps getting worse.\n\n00:04:24.315 --> 00:04:25.259\n[27% of subjects' first 5 SSN digits identified (with 4 attempts)]\n\n00:04:25.259 --> 00:04:29.086\nBut in fact, we even decided to develop an iPhone app\n\n00:04:29.086 -->

00:04:37.550\nand then do what I just described to you in real time:\n\n00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:39.638\nlooking for a match, finding public information,\n\n00:04:39.638 --> 00:04:41.368\ntrying to infer sensitive information,\n\n00:04:41.368 --> 00:04:43.959\nand then sending back to the phone\n\n00:04:43.959 --> 00:04:47.568\nso that it is overlaid on the face of the subject,\n\n00:04:47.568

should we care?\n\n00:05:24.631 --> 00:05:26.522\nWe may like to believe\n\n00:05:26.522 --> 00:05:29.562\nthat the future with so much wealth of data\n\n00:05:29.562 --> 00:05:32.076\nwould be a

00:05:39.556\nwhich are more objective.\n\n00:05:39.556 --> 00:05:42.116\nIn another experiment, we presented to our subjects\n\n00:05:42.116 --> 00:05:44.362\ninformation about a potential job candidate.\n\n00:05:44.362 --> 00:05:47.540\nWe included in this information some references\n\n00:05:47.540 --> 00:05:50.186\nto some funny, absolutely legal,\n\n00:05:50.186 --> 00:05:52.651\nbut perhaps slightly embarrassing information\n\n00:05:52.651 --> 00:05:54.671\nthat the subject had posted online.\n\n00:05:54.671 --> 00:05:57.037\nNow interestingly, among our subjects,\n\n00:05:57.037

00:06:08.983\nwas more likely to judge harshly our subject?\n\n00:06:08.983 --> 00:06:10.940\nParadoxically, it was the group\n\n00:06:10.940 --> 00:06:12.673\nwho had posted similar

What makes us who we are anyway?HP: (In Chinese)YR: I used to read Spider-Man comics, watch kung fu movies, take philosophy lessons from Bruce Lee. He would say things like \u2014HP: Empty your mind. (Laughter) Be formless, shapeless, like water. Now you put water into a cup. It becomes the cup. You put water into a bottle, it becomes the bottle. Put it in a teapot, it becomes the teapot. Now, water can flow or it can crash. Be water, my friend. (Applause)YR: This year, I am 32 years old, the same age Bruce Lee was when he died. I have been wondering recently, if he were alive today, what advice he would give me about making this TED Talk.HP: Don't imitate my voice. It offends me.(Laughter)YR: Good advice, but I still think that we learn who we are by copying others. Who here hasn't imitated their childhood hero in the playground, or mum or father? I have.HP: A few years ago, in order to make this video for my artwork, I shaved off all my hair so that I could grow it back as my father had it when he first emigrated from India to the U.K. in the 1960s. He had a side parting and a neat mustache.At first, it was going very well. I even started to get discounts in Indian shops.(Laughter)But then very quickly, I started to underestimate my mustache growing ability, and it got way too big. It didn't look Indian anymore. Instead, people from across the road, they would shout things like \u2014HP and YR: Arriba! Arriba! \u00c1ndale! \u00c1ndale!(Laughter)HP: Actually, I don't know why I am even talking like this. My dad doesn't even have an Indian accent anymore. He talks like this now.So it's not just my father that I've imitated. A few years ago I went to China for a few months, and I couldn't speak Chinese, and this frustrated me, so I wrote about this and had it translated into Chinese, and then I learned this by heart, like music, I guess.YR: This phrase is now etched into my mind clearer than the pin number to my bank card, so I can pretend I speak Chinese fluently. When I had learned this phrase, I had an artist over there hear me out to see how accurate it sounded.I spoke the phrase, and then he laughed and told me, \"Oh yeah, that's great, only it kind of sounds like a woman.\"I said, \"What?\"He said, \"Yeah, you learned from a woman?\"I said, \"Yes. So?\"He then explained the tonal differences between male and female voices are very different and distinct, and that I had learned it very well, but in a woman's voice.(Laughter)(Applause)HP: Okay. So this imitation business does come with risk. It doesn't always go as you plan it, even with a talented translator. But I am going to stick with it, because contrary to what we might usually assume, imitating somebody can reveal something unique. So every time I fail to become more like my father, I become more like myself. Every time I fail to become Bruce Lee, I become more authentically me.This is my art. I strive for authenticity, even if it comes in a shape that we might not usually expect. It's only recently that I've started to understand that I didn't learn to sit like this through being Indian. I learned this from Spider-Man.(Laughter)Thank you.(Applause)", "id": 1849, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:12.864 --> 00:00:23.261\nHetain Patel: (In Chinese)\n\n00:00:23.261 --> 00:00:26.564\nYuyu Rau: Hi, I'm Hetain.

I set up a climate change NGO called The Climate Group. I worked on forestry issues in WWF. I worked on development and agriculture issues in the U.N. system. About 25 years in total, and then three years ago, I found myself talking to IKEA's CEO about joining his team. Like many people here, well, I want to maximize my personal impact in the world, so I'm going to explain why I joined the team there.But first, let's just take three numbers.The first number is three: three billion people. This is the number of people joining the global middle class by 2030, coming out of poverty. It's fantastic for them and their families, but we've got two billion people in the global middle class today, and this swells that number to five, a big challenge when we already have resource scarcity.The second number is six: This is six degrees centigrade, what we're heading towards in terms of global warming. We're not heading towards one degree or three degrees or four degrees, we're heading toward six degrees. And if you think about it, all of the weird weather we've been having the last few years, much of that is due to just one degree warming, and we need CO2 emissions to peak by the end of this decade globally and then come down. It's not inevitable, but we need to act decisively.The third number is 12: That's the number of cities in the world that had a million or more people when my grandmother was born. You can see my grandmother there. That was in the beginning of the last century. So just 12 cities. She was born in Manchester, England, the ninth largest city in the world. Now there are 500 cities, nearly, with a million people or more in them. And if you look at the century from 1950 to 2050, that's the century when we build all the world's cities, the century that we're in the middle of right now. Every other century was kind of practice, and this lays down a blueprint for how we live.So think about it. We're building cities like never before, bringing people out of poverty like never before, and changing the climate like never before. Sustainability has gone from a nice-to-do to a must-do. it's about what we do right here, right now, and for the rest of our working lives.So I'm going to talk a little bit about what business can do and what a business like IKEA can do, and we have a sustainability strategy called \"people and planet positive\" to help guide our business to have a positive impact on the world. Why would we not want to have a positive impact on the world as a business? Other companies have sustainability strategies. I'm going to refer to some of those as well, and I'm just going to mention a few of the commitments as illustrations that we've got.But first, let's think of customers. We know from asking people from China to the U.S. that the vast majority of people care about sustainability after the day-to-day issues, the day-to-day issues of, how do I get my kids to school? Can I pay the bills at the end of the month? Then they care about big issues like climate change. But they want it to be easy, affordable and attractive, and they expect business to help, and they're a little bit disappointed today.So take your mind back and think of the first sustainable products. We had detergents that could wash your whites grayer. We had the early energy-efficient light bulbs that took five minutes to warm up and then you were left looking a kind of sickly color. And we had the rough, recycled toilet paper. So every time you pulled on a t-shirt, or switched the light on, or went to the bathroom, or sometimes all three together, you were reminded sustainability was about compromise. It wasn't a great start.Today we have choices. We can make products that are beautiful or ugly, sustainable or unsustainable, affordable or expensive, functional or useless. So let's make beautiful, functional, affordable, sustainable products.Let's take the LED. The LED is the next best thing to daylight. The old-fashioned lightbulbs, the incandescent bulbs \u2014 I'm not going to ask for a show of hands of how many of you still have them in your homes, wasting energy every time you switch them on \u2014 change them after this \u2014 or whether we have them on the stage here at TED or not \u2014 but those old incandescent light bulbs really should have been sold as heaters. They were mis-sold for more than a hundred years. They produced heat and a little bit of light on the side. Now we have lights that produce light and a little bit of heat on the side. You save 85 percent of the electricity with an LED that you would have done in an old incandescent. And the best thing is, they'll also last for more than 20 years. So think about that. You'll change your smartphone seven or eight times, probably more if you're in this audience. You'll change your car, if you have one, three or four times. Your kids could go to school, go to college, go away and have kids of their own, come back, bring the grandkids, you'll have the same lightbulb saving you energy. So LEDs are fantastic. What we decided to do was not to sell LEDs on the side marked up high and continue to push all the old bulbs, the halogens and the CFLs. We decided, over the next two years, we will ban the halogens and the CFLs ourselves. We will go all in. And this is what business needs to do: go all-in, go 100 percent, because then you stop investing in the old stuff, you invest in the new stuff, you lower costs, you use your supply chain and your creativity and you get the prices down so everybody can afford the best lights so they can save energy.(Applause)It's not just about products in people's homes. We've got to think about the raw materials that produce our products. Obviously there's fantastic opportunities with recycled materials, and we can and will go zero waste. And there's opportunities in a circular economy. But we're still dependent on natural, raw materials. Let's take cotton. Cotton's brilliant. Probably many people are wearing cotton right now. It's a brilliant textile in use. It's really dirty in production. It uses lots of pesticides, lots of fertilizer, lots of water. So we've worked with others, with other businesses and NGOs, on the Better Cotton Initiative, working right back down to the farm, and there you can halve the amount of water and halve the chemical inputs, the yields increase, and 60 percent of the costs of running many of these farms with farmers with low incomes can be chemical imports. Yields increase, and you halve the input costs. Farmers are coming out of poverty. They love it. Already hundreds of thousands of farmers have been reached, and now we've got 60 percent better cotton in our business. Again, we're going all-in. By 2015, we'll be 100 percent Better Cotton.Take the topic of 100 percent targets, actually. People sometimes think that 100 percent's going to be hard, and we've had the conversation in the business. Actually, we found 100 percent is easier to do than 90 percent or 50 percent. If you have a 90 percent target, everyone in the business finds a reason to be in the 10 percent. When it's 100 percent, it's kind of clear, and businesspeople like clarity, because then you just get the job done.So, wood. We know with forestry, it's a choice. You've got illegal logging and deforestation still on a very large scale, or you can have fantastic, responsible forestry that we can be proud of. It's a simple choice, so we've worked for many years with the Forest Stewardship Council, with literally hundreds of other organizations, and there's a point here about collaboration. So hundreds of others, of NGOs, of forest workers' unions, and of businesses, have helped create the Forest Stewardship Council, which sets standards for forestry and then checks the forestry's good on the ground. Now together, through our supply chain, with partners, we've managed to certify 35 million hectares of forestry. That's about the size of Germany. And we've decided in the next three years, we will double the volume of certified material we put through our business. So be decisive on these issues. Use your supply chain to drive good.But then it comes to your operations. Some things are certain, I think. We know we'll use electricity in 20 or 30 years' time. We know the sun will be shining somewhere, and the wind will still be blowing in 20 or 30 years' time. So why not make our energy out of the sun and the wind? And why not take control of it ourselves? So we're going 100 percent renewable. By 2020, we'll produce more renewable energy than the energy we consume as a business. For all of our stores, our own factories, our distribution centers, we've installed 300,000 solar panels so far, and we've got 14 wind farms we own and operate in six countries, and we're not done yet. But think of a solar panel. A solar panel pays for itself in seven or eight years. The electricity is free. Every time the sun comes out after that, the electricity is free. So this is a good thing for the CFO, not just the sustainability guy. Every business can do things like this.But then we've got to look beyond our operations, and I think everybody would agree that now business has to take full responsibility for the impacts of your supply chain. Many businesses now, fortunately, have codes of conduct and audit their supply chains, but not every business. Far from it. And this came in IKEA actually in the '90s. We found there was a risk of child labor in the supply chain, and people in the business were shocked. And it was clearly totally unacceptable, so then you have to act. So a code of conduct was developed, and now we have 80 auditors out in the world every day making sure all our factories secure good working conditions and protect human rights and make sure there is no child labor.But it's not just as simple as making sure there's no child labor. You've got to say that's not enough today. I think we'd all agree that children are the most important people in the world and the most vulnerable. So what can a business do today to actually use your total value chain to support a better quality of life and protect child rights? We've worked with UNICEF and Save the Children on developing some new business principles with children's rights. Increasing numbers of businesses are signing up to these, but actually in a survey, many business leaders said they thought their business had nothing to do with children. So what we decided to do was, we will look and ask ourselves the tough questions with partners who know more than us, what can we do to go beyond our business to help improve the lives of children? We also have a foundation that's committed to work through partners and help improve the lives and protect the rights of 100 million children by 2015.You know the phrase, you can manage what you measure? Well, you should measure what you care about. If you're not measuring things, you don't care and you don't know. So let's take an example, measure the things that are important in your business. Isn't it about time that businesses were led equally by men and women?(Applause)So we know for our 17,000 managers across IKEA that 47 percent are women today, but it's not enough, and we want to close the gap and follow it all the way through to senior management. And we do not want to wait another hundred years. So we've launched a women's open network this week in IKEA, and we'll do whatever it takes to lead the change. So the message here is, measure what you care about and lead the change, and don't wait a hundred years.So we've gone from sustainability being a nice-to-do to a must-do. It's a must-do. It's still nice to do, but it's a must-do. And everybody can do something on this as an individual. Be a discerning consumer. Vote with your wallets. Search out the companies that are acting on this. But also, there are other businesses already acting. I mentioned renewable energy. You go to Google or Lego, they're going 100 percent renewable too, in the same way that we are. On having really good sustainability strategies, there are companies like Nike, Patagonia, Timberland, Marks & Spencer. But I don't think any of those businesses would say they're perfect. We certainly wouldn't. We'll make mistakes going forward, but it's about setting a clear direction, being transparent, having a dialogue with the right partners, and choosing to lead on the issues that really count.So if you're a business leader, if you're not already weaving sustainability right into the heart of your business model, I'd urge you to do so. And together, we can help create a sustainable world, and, if we get it right, we can make sustainability affordable for the many people, not a luxury for the few.Thank you.(Applause)", "id": 1850, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:12.252 --> 00:00:15.005\nI've spent my life working on sustainability.\n\n00:00:15.005 --> 00:00:17.060\nI set up a climate change NGO\n\n00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:18.380\ncalled The Climate Group.\n\n00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:21.771\nI worked on forestry issues in WWF.\n\n00:00:21.771 --> 00:00:23.847\nI worked on development and agriculture issues\n\n00:00:23.847 --> 00:00:25.582\nin the U.N. system.\n\n00:00:25.582 --> 00:00:27.506\nAbout 25 years in total,\n\n00:00:27.506 --> 00:00:30.229\nand then three years ago, I found myself talking to\n\n00:00:30.229 --> 00:00:33.514\nIKEA's CEO about joining his team.\n\n00:00:33.514 --> 00:00:35.540\nLike many people here, well,\n\n00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:39.475\nI want to maximize my personal impact in the world,\n\n00:00:39.475 --> 00:00:44.161\nso I'm going to explain why I joined the team there.\n\n00:00:44.161 --> 00:00:46.968\nBut first, let's just take three numbers.\n\n00:00:46.968 --> 00:00:49.039\nThe first number is three:\n\n00:00:49.039 --> 00:00:50.599\nthree billion people.\n\n00:00:50.599 --> 00:00:52.410\nThis is the number of people joining\n\n00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:54.462\nthe global middle class by 2030,\n\n00:00:54.462 --> 00:00:55.771\ncoming out of poverty.\n\n00:00:55.771 --> 00:00:58.012\nIt's fantastic for them and their families,\n\n00:00:58.012 --> 00:01:01.055\nbut we've got two billion people in the global middle class today,\n\n00:01:01.055 --> 00:01:03.352\nand this swells that number to five,\n\n00:01:03.352 --> 00:01:06.682\na big challenge when we already have resource scarcity.\n\n00:01:06.682 --> 00:01:08.559\nThe second number is six:\n\n00:01:08.559 --> 00:01:10.704\nThis is six degrees centigrade,\n\n00:01:10.704 --> 00:01:13.268\nwhat we're heading towards in terms of global warming.\n\n00:01:13.268 --> 00:01:15.319\nWe're not heading towards one degree or three degrees\n\n00:01:15.319 --> 00:01:17.667\nor four degrees, we're heading toward six degrees.\n\n00:01:17.667 --> 00:01:20.356\nAnd if you think about it, all of the weird weather\n\n00:01:20.356 --> 00:01:22.199\nwe've been having the last few years,\n\n00:01:22.199 --> 00:01:24.781\nmuch of that is due to just one degree warming,\n\n00:01:24.781 --> 00:01:27.076\nand we need CO2 emissions to peak\n\n00:01:27.076 --> 00:01:29.308\nby the end of this decade globally\n\n00:01:29.308 --> 00:01:31.036\nand then come down.\n\n00:01:31.036 --> 00:01:35.107\nIt's not inevitable, but we need to act decisively.\n\n00:01:35.107 --> 00:01:36.868\nThe third number is 12:\n\n00:01:36.868 --> 00:01:38.361\nThat's the number of cities in the world\n\n00:01:38.361 --> 00:01:40.152\nthat had a million or more people\n\n00:01:40.152 --> 00:01:41.585\nwhen my grandmother was born.\n\n00:01:41.585 --> 00:01:43.205\nYou can see my grandmother there.\n\n00:01:43.205 --> 00:01:45.248\nThat was in the beginning of the last century.\n\n00:01:45.248 --> 00:01:47.264\nSo just 12 cities. She was born in Manchester, England,\n\n00:01:47.264 --> 00:01:49.285\nthe ninth largest city in the world.\n\n00:01:49.285 --> 00:01:51.990\nNow there are 500 cities, nearly,\n\n00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:54.421\nwith a million people or more in them.\n\n00:01:54.421 --> 00:01:57.765\nAnd if you look at the century from 1950 to 2050,\n\n00:01:57.765 --> 00:02:01.509\nthat's the century when we build all the world's cities,\n\n00:02:01.509 --> 00:02:03.919\nthe century that we're in the middle of right now.\n\n00:02:03.919 --> 00:02:06.765\nEvery other century was kind of practice,\n\n00:02:06.765 --> 00:02:11.583\nand this lays down a blueprint for how we live.\n\n00:02:11.583 --> 00:02:13.338\nSo think about it.\n\n00:02:13.338 --> 00:02:16.108\nWe're building cities like never before,\n\n00:02:16.108 --> 00:02:18.634\nbringing people out of poverty like never before,\n\n00:02:18.634 --> 00:02:21.009\nand changing the climate like never before.\n\n00:02:21.009 --> 00:02:24.069\nSustainability has gone from a nice-to-do\n\n00:02:24.069 --> 00:02:25.734\nto a must-do.\n\n00:02:25.734 --> 00:02:28.567\nit's about what we do right here, right now,\n\n00:02:28.567 --> 00:02:32.248\nand for the rest of our working lives.\n\n00:02:32.248 --> 00:02:34.280\nSo I'm going to talk a little bit about\n\n00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:35.653\nwhat business can do\n\n00:02:35.653 --> 00:02:37.955\nand what a business like IKEA can do,\n\n00:02:37.955 --> 00:02:40.622\nand we have a sustainability strategy\n\n00:02:40.622 --> 00:02:42.619\ncalled \"people and planet positive\"\n\n00:02:42.619 --> 00:02:46.266\nto help guide our business to have a positive impact on the world.\n\n00:02:46.266 --> 00:02:48.401\nWhy would we not want to have a positive impact\n\n00:02:48.401 --> 00:02:50.989\non the world as a business?\n\n00:02:50.989 --> 00:02:53.477\nOther companies have sustainability strategies.\n\n00:02:53.477 --> 00:02:55.315\nI'm going to refer to some of those as well,\n\n00:02:55.315 --> 00:02:56.852\nand I'm just going to mention a few\n\n00:02:56.852 --> 00:02:59.448\nof the commitments as illustrations that we've got.\n\n00:02:59.448 --> 00:03:01.464\nBut first, let's think of customers.\n\n00:03:01.464 --> 00:03:05.289\nWe know from asking people from China to the U.S.\n\n00:03:05.289 --> 00:03:08.617\nthat the vast majority of people care about sustainability\n\n00:03:08.617 --> 00:03:10.499\nafter the day-to-day issues,\n\n00:03:10.499 --> 00:03:13.076\nthe day-to-day issues of, how do I get my kids to school?\n\n00:03:13.076 --> 00:03:15.055\nCan I pay the bills at the end of the month?\n\n00:03:15.055 --> 00:03:18.517\nThen they care about big issues like climate change.\n\n00:03:18.517 --> 00:03:22.949\nBut they want it to be easy, affordable and attractive,\n\n00:03:22.949 --> 00:03:24.941\nand they expect business to help,\n\n00:03:24.941 --> 00:03:27.735\nand they're a little bit disappointed today.\n\n00:03:27.735 --> 00:03:30.369\nSo take your mind back and think\n\n00:03:30.369 --> 00:03:31.956\nof the first sustainable products.\n\n00:03:31.956 --> 00:03:35.869\nWe had detergents that could wash your whites grayer.\n\n00:03:35.869 --> 00:03:38.923\nWe had the early energy-efficient light bulbs\n\n00:03:38.923 --> 00:03:40.770\nthat took five minutes to warm up\n\n00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:43.841\nand then you were left looking a kind of sickly color.\n\n00:03:43.841 --> 00:03:47.209\nAnd we had the rough, recycled toilet paper.\n\n00:03:47.209 --> 00:03:49.941\nSo every time you pulled on a t-shirt,\n\n00:03:49.941 --> 00:03:52.047\nor switched the light on, or went to the bathroom,\n\n00:03:52.047 --> 00:03:53.716\nor sometimes all three together,\n\n00:03:53.716 --> 00:03:57.161\nyou were reminded sustainability was about compromise.\n\n00:03:57.161 --> 00:04:00.059\nIt wasn't a great start.\n\n00:04:00.059 --> 00:04:02.347\nToday we have choices.\n\n00:04:02.347 --> 00:04:05.644\nWe can make products that are beautiful or ugly,\n\n00:04:05.644 --> 00:04:10.445\nsustainable or unsustainable, affordable or expensive,\n\n00:04:10.445 --> 00:04:12.308\nfunctional or useless.\n\n00:04:12.308 --> 00:04:15.173\nSo let's make beautiful, functional, affordable,\n\n00:04:15.173 --> 00:04:17.493\nsustainable products.\n\n00:04:17.493 --> 00:04:19.789\nLet's take the LED.\n\n00:04:19.789 --> 00:04:23.203\nThe LED is the next best thing to daylight.\n\n00:04:23.203 --> 00:04:26.384\nThe old-fashioned lightbulbs, the incandescent bulbs --\n\n00:04:26.384 --> 00:04:27.892\nI'm not going to ask for a show of hands\n\n00:04:27.892 --> 00:04:30.181\nof how many of you still have them in your homes,\n\n00:04:30.181 --> 00:04:33.003\nwasting energy every time you switch them on --\n\n00:04:33.003 --> 00:04:34.440\nchange them after this --\n\n00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:38.133\nor whether we have them on the stage here at TED or not --\n\n00:04:38.133 --> 00:04:41.924\nbut those old incandescent light bulbs\n\n00:04:41.924 --> 00:04:44.946\nreally should have been sold as heaters.\n\n00:04:44.946 --> 00:04:46.923\nThey were mis-sold for more than a hundred years.\n\n00:04:46.923 --> 00:04:49.365\nThey produced heat and a little bit of light on the side.\n\n00:04:49.365 --> 00:04:51.437\nNow we have lights that produce light\n\n00:04:51.437 --> 00:04:53.129\nand a little bit of heat on the side.\n\n00:04:53.129 --> 00:04:55.955\nYou save 85 percent of the electricity with an LED\n\n00:04:55.955 --> 00:04:57.998\nthat you would have done in an old incandescent.\n\n00:04:57.998 --> 00:04:59.733\nAnd the best thing is, they'll also last\n\n00:04:59.733 --> 00:05:01.312\nfor more than 20 years.\n\n00:05:01.312 --> 00:05:02.568\nSo think about that.\n\n00:05:02.568 --> 00:05:05.064\nYou'll change your smartphone seven or eight times,\n\n00:05:05.064 --> 00:05:07.140\nprobably more if you're in this audience.\n\n00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:09.750\nYou'll change your car, if you have one, three or four times.\n\n00:05:09.750 --> 00:05:12.302\nYour kids could go to school, go to college,\n\n00:05:12.302 --> 00:05:14.257\ngo away and have kids of their own, come back,\n\n00:05:14.257 --> 00:05:15.683\nbring the grandkids,\n\n00:05:15.683 --> 00:05:19.569\nyou'll have the same lightbulb saving you energy.\n\n00:05:19.569 --> 00:05:22.408\nSo LEDs are fantastic.\n\n00:05:22.408 --> 00:05:23.934\nWhat we decided to do\n\n00:05:23.934 --> 00:05:26.887\nwas not to sell LEDs on the side marked up high\n\n00:05:26.887 --> 00:05:29.113\nand continue to push all the old bulbs,\n\n00:05:29.113 --> 00:05:31.104\nthe halogens and the CFLs.\n\n00:05:31.104 --> 00:05:34.034\nWe decided, over the next two years,\n\n00:05:34.034 --> 00:05:36.549\nwe will ban the halogens and the CFLs ourselves.\n\n00:05:36.549 --> 00:05:37.917\nWe will go all in.\n\n00:05:37.917 --> 00:05:39.626\nAnd this is what business needs to do: go all-in,\n\n00:05:39.626 --> 00:05:41.070\ngo 100 percent,\n\n00:05:41.070 --> 00:05:42.661\nbecause then you stop investing in the old stuff,\n\n00:05:42.661 --> 00:05:44.815\nyou invest in the new stuff, you lower costs,\n\n00:05:44.815 --> 00:05:47.144\nyou use your supply chain and your creativity\n\n00:05:47.144 --> 00:05:49.901\nand you get the prices down so everybody can afford\n\n00:05:49.901 --> 00:05:52.852\nthe best lights so they can save energy.\n\n00:05:52.852 -->

--> 00:06:03.957\nthat produce our products.\n\n00:06:03.957 --> 00:06:05.784\nObviously there's fantastic opportunities\n\n00:06:05.784 --> 00:06:07.278\nwith recycled materials,\n\n00:06:07.278 --> 00:06:10.121\nand we can and will go zero waste.\n\n00:06:10.121 --> 00:06:12.109\nAnd there's opportunities in a circular economy.\n\n00:06:12.109 --> 00:06:15.551\nBut we're still dependent on natural, raw materials.\n\n00:06:15.551 --> 00:06:17.341\nLet's take cotton.\n\n00:06:17.341 --> 00:06:19.070\nCotton's brilliant. Probably many people\n\n00:06:19.070 --> 00:06:20.481\nare wearing cotton right now.\n\n00:06:20.481 --> 00:06:22.015\nIt's a brilliant textile in use.\n\n00:06:22.015 --> 00:06:23.582\nIt's really dirty in production.\n\n00:06:23.582 --> 00:06:27.716\nIt uses lots of pesticides, lots of fertilizer, lots of water.\n\n00:06:27.716 --> 00:06:29.336\nSo we've worked with others,\n\n00:06:29.336 --> 00:06:30.938\nwith other businesses and NGOs,\n\n00:06:30.938 --> 00:06:32.794\non the Better Cotton Initiative,\n\n00:06:32.794 --> 00:06:34.963\nworking right back down to the farm,\n\n00:06:34.963 --> 00:06:36.798\nand there you can halve the amount of water\n\n00:06:36.798 --> 00:06:38.629\nand halve the chemical inputs,\n\n00:06:38.629 --> 00:06:41.525\nthe yields increase, and 60 percent of the costs\n\n00:06:41.525 --> 00:06:43.194\nof running many of these farms\n\n00:06:43.194 --> 00:06:45.238\nwith farmers with low incomes\n\n00:06:45.238 --> 00:06:46.941\ncan be chemical imports.\n\n00:06:46.941 --> 00:06:49.086\nYields increase, and you halve the input costs.\n\n00:06:49.086 --> 00:06:51.961\nFarmers are coming out of poverty. They love it.\n\n00:06:51.961 --> 00:06:53.688\nAlready hundreds of thousands of farmers\n\n00:06:53.688 --> 00:06:55.278\nhave been reached,\n\n00:06:55.278 --> 00:06:57.942\nand now we've got 60 percent better cotton in our business.\n\n00:06:57.942 --> 00:06:59.284\nAgain, we're going all-in.\n\n00:06:59.284 --> 00:07:02.434\nBy 2015, we'll be 100 percent Better Cotton.\n\n00:07:02.434 --> 00:07:05.420\nTake the topic of 100 percent targets, actually.\n\n00:07:05.420 --> 00:07:07.092\nPeople sometimes think that\n\n00:07:07.092 --> 00:07:08.557\n100 percent's going to be hard,\n\n00:07:08.557 --> 00:07:10.328\nand we've had the conversation in the business.\n\n00:07:10.328 --> 00:07:12.170\nActually, we found 100 percent is easier to do\n\n00:07:12.170 --> 00:07:14.157\nthan 90 percent or 50 percent.\n\n00:07:14.157 --> 00:07:15.589\nIf you have a 90 percent target,\n\n00:07:15.589 --> 00:07:17.010\neveryone in the business finds a reason\n\n00:07:17.010 --> 00:07:18.815\nto be in the 10 percent.\n\n00:07:18.815 --> 00:07:22.385\nWhen it's 100 percent, it's kind of clear,\n\n00:07:22.385 --> 00:07:25.275\nand businesspeople like clarity,\n\n00:07:25.275 --> 00:07:27.940\nbecause then you just get the job done.\n\n00:07:27.940 --> 00:07:30.688\nSo, wood. We know with forestry, it's a choice.\n\n00:07:30.688 --> 00:07:32.282\nYou've got illegal logging\n\n00:07:32.282 --> 00:07:35.107\nand deforestation still on a very large scale,\n\n00:07:35.107 --> 00:07:37.807\nor you can have fantastic, responsible forestry\n\n00:07:37.807 --> 00:07:39.942\nthat we can be proud of.\n\n00:07:39.942 --> 00:07:42.024\nIt's a simple choice, so we've worked\n\n00:07:42.024 --> 00:07:44.568\nfor many years with the Forest Stewardship Council,\n\n00:07:44.568 --> 00:07:46.938\nwith literally hundreds of other organizations,\n\n00:07:46.938 --> 00:07:49.378\nand there's a point here about collaboration.\n\n00:07:49.378 --> 00:07:51.273\nSo hundreds of others, of NGOs,\n\n00:07:51.273 --> 00:07:53.855\nof forest workers' unions, and of businesses,\n\n00:07:53.855 --> 00:07:55.527\nhave helped create the Forest Stewardship Council,\n\n00:07:55.527 --> 00:07:57.309\nwhich sets standards for forestry\n\n00:07:57.309 --> 00:07:59.831\nand then checks the forestry's good on the ground.\n\n00:07:59.831 --> 00:08:02.074\nNow together, through our supply chain,\n\n00:08:02.074 --> 00:08:03.941\nwith partners, we've managed to certify\n\n00:08:03.941 --> 00:08:06.818\n35 million hectares of forestry.\n\n00:08:06.818 --> 00:08:09.355\nThat's about the size of Germany.\n\n00:08:09.355 --> 00:08:11.143\nAnd we've decided in the next three years,\n\n00:08:11.143 --> 00:08:13.178\nwe will double the volume of certified material\n\n00:08:13.178 --> 00:08:15.316\nwe put through our business.\n\n00:08:15.316 --> 00:08:17.956\nSo be decisive on these issues.\n\n00:08:17.956 --> 00:08:19.927\nUse your supply chain to drive good.\n\n00:08:19.927 --> 00:08:21.953\nBut then it comes to your operations.\n\n00:08:21.953 --> 00:08:24.603\nSome things are certain, I think.\n\n00:08:24.603 --> 00:08:27.618\nWe know we'll use electricity in 20 or 30 years' time.\n\n00:08:27.618 --> 00:08:30.541\nWe know the sun will be shining somewhere,\n\n00:08:30.541 --> 00:08:33.633\nand the wind will still be blowing in 20 or 30 years' time.\n\n00:08:33.633 --> 00:08:36.285\nSo why not make our energy out of the sun and the wind?\n\n00:08:36.285 --> 00:08:38.513\nAnd why not take control of it ourselves?\n\n00:08:38.513 --> 00:08:40.873\nSo we're going 100 percent renewable.\n\n00:08:40.873 --> 00:08:43.629\nBy 2020, we'll produce more renewable energy\n\n00:08:43.629 --> 00:08:45.649\nthan the energy we consume as a business.\n\n00:08:45.649 --> 00:08:47.625\nFor all of our stores, our own factories,\n\n00:08:47.625 --> 00:08:49.003\nour distribution centers,\n\n00:08:49.003 --> 00:08:51.457\nwe've installed 300,000 solar panels so far,\n\n00:08:51.457 --> 00:08:54.831\nand we've got 14 wind farms we own and operate\n\n00:08:54.831 --> 00:08:57.458\nin six countries, and we're not done yet.\n\n00:08:57.458 --> 00:08:59.242\nBut think of a solar panel.\n\n00:08:59.242 --> 00:09:01.421\nA solar panel pays for itself in seven or eight years.\n\n00:09:01.421 --> 00:09:02.914\nThe electricity is free.\n\n00:09:02.914 --> 00:09:04.719\nEvery time the sun comes out after that,\n\n00:09:04.719 --> 00:09:06.154\nthe electricity is free.\n\n00:09:06.154 --> 00:09:08.171\nSo this is a good thing for the CFO,\n\n00:09:08.171 --> 00:09:10.114\nnot just the sustainability guy.\n\n00:09:10.114 --> 00:09:13.148\nEvery business can do things like this.\n\n00:09:13.148 --> 00:09:16.127\nBut then we've got to look beyond our operations,\n\n00:09:16.127 --> 00:09:17.876\nand I think everybody would agree\n\n00:09:17.876 --> 00:09:20.248\nthat now business has to take full responsibility\n\n00:09:20.248 --> 00:09:22.452\nfor the impacts of your supply chain.\n\n00:09:22.452 --> 00:09:24.768\nMany businesses now, fortunately,\n\n00:09:24.768 --> 00:09:26.775\nhave codes of conduct and audit their supply chains,\n\n00:09:26.775 --> 00:09:28.821\nbut not every business. Far from it.\n\n00:09:28.821 --> 00:09:31.335\nAnd this came in IKEA actually in the '90s.\n\n00:09:31.335 --> 00:09:33.076\nWe found there was a risk\n\n00:09:33.076 --> 00:09:35.078\nof child labor in the supply chain,\n\n00:09:35.078 --> 00:09:37.588\nand people in the business were shocked.\n\n00:09:37.588 --> 00:09:40.912\nAnd it was clearly totally unacceptable, so then you have to act.\n\n00:09:40.912 --> 00:09:43.056\nSo a code of conduct was developed,\n\n00:09:43.056 --> 00:09:46.007\nand now we have 80 auditors out in the world\n\n00:09:46.007 --> 00:09:48.038\nevery day making sure all our factories\n\n00:09:48.038 --> 00:09:50.322\nsecure good working conditions\n\n00:09:50.322 --> 00:09:51.871\nand protect human rights\n\n00:09:51.871 --> 00:09:54.132\nand make sure there is no child labor.\n\n00:09:54.132 --> 00:09:56.292\nBut it's not just as simple as making sure\n\n00:09:56.292 --> 00:09:58.324\nthere's no child labor.\n\n00:09:58.324 --> 00:10:00.524\nYou've got to say that's not enough today.\n\n00:10:00.524 --> 00:10:02.572\nI think we'd all agree that children\n\n00:10:02.572 --> 00:10:04.768\nare the most important people in the world\n\n00:10:04.768 --> 00:10:06.665\nand the most vulnerable.\n\n00:10:06.665 --> 00:10:08.913\nSo what can a business do today\n\n00:10:08.913 --> 00:10:10.797\nto actually use your total value chain\n\n00:10:10.797 --> 00:10:13.076\nto support a better quality of life\n\n00:10:13.076 --> 00:10:14.664\nand protect child rights?\n\n00:10:14.664 --> 00:10:16.961\nWe've worked with UNICEF and Save the Children\n\n00:10:16.961 --> 00:10:19.436\non developing some new business principles\n\n00:10:19.436 --> 00:10:20.901\nwith children's rights.\n\n00:10:20.901 --> 00:10:22.718\nIncreasing numbers of businesses\n\n00:10:22.718 --> 00:10:24.238\nare signing up to these,\n\n00:10:24.238 --> 00:10:26.701\nbut actually in a survey, many business leaders\n\n00:10:26.701 --> 00:10:29.568\nsaid they thought their business had nothing to do with children.\n\n00:10:29.568 --> 00:10:33.067\nSo what we decided to do was, we will look\n\n00:10:33.067 --> 00:10:34.628\nand ask ourselves the tough questions\n\n00:10:34.628 --> 00:10:36.692\nwith partners who know more than us,\n\n00:10:36.692 --> 00:10:39.649\nwhat can we do to go beyond our business\n\n00:10:39.649 --> 00:10:41.491\nto help improve the lives of children?\n\n00:10:41.491 --> 00:10:43.310\nWe also have a foundation\n\n00:10:43.310 --> 00:10:45.205\nthat's committed to work through partners\n\n00:10:45.205 --> 00:10:47.828\nand help improve the lives and protect the rights\n\n00:10:47.828 --> 00:10:50.695\nof 100 million children by 2015.\n\n00:10:50.695 --> 00:10:52.371\nYou know the phrase,\n\n00:10:52.371 --> 00:10:55.749\nyou can manage what you measure?\n\n00:10:55.749 --> 00:11:00.399\nWell, you should measure what you care about.\n\n00:11:00.399 --> 00:11:01.948\nIf you're not measuring things,\n\n00:11:01.948 --> 00:11:04.692\nyou don't care and you don't know.\n\n00:11:04.692 --> 00:11:06.861\nSo let's take an example, measure the things\n\n00:11:06.861 --> 00:11:09.018\nthat are important in your business.\n\n00:11:09.018 --> 00:11:11.301\nIsn't it about time that businesses\n\n00:11:11.301 --> 00:11:14.279\nwere led equally by men and women?\n\n00:11:14.279 --> 00:11:17.262\n(Applause)\n\n00:11:17.262 --> 00:11:22.404\nSo we know for our 17,000 managers across IKEA\n\n00:11:22.404 --> 00:11:25.368\nthat 47 percent are women today,\n\n00:11:25.368 --> 00:11:27.764\nbut it's not enough, and we want to close the gap\n\n00:11:27.764 --> 00:11:30.051\nand follow it all the way through to senior management.\n\n00:11:30.051 --> 00:11:32.897\nAnd we do not want to wait another hundred years.\n\n00:11:32.897 --> 00:11:35.856\nSo we've launched a women's open network\n\n00:11:35.856 --> 00:11:37.381\nthis week in IKEA,\n\n00:11:37.381 --> 00:11:39.557\nand we'll do whatever it takes to lead the change.\n\n00:11:39.557 --> 00:11:40.972\nSo the message here is,\n\n00:11:40.972 --> 00:11:43.356\nmeasure what you care about and lead the change,\n\n00:11:43.356 --> 00:11:46.359\nand don't wait a hundred years.\n\n00:11:46.359 --> 00:11:48.796\nSo we've gone from sustainability\n\n00:11:48.796 --> 00:11:54.032\nbeing a nice-to-do to a must-do.

Per capita incomes since the year 2000 have doubled, and this boom is impacting on everyone. Life expectancy has increased by one year every three years for the last decade. That means if an African child is born today, rather than three days ago, they will get an extra day of life at the end of their lifespan. It's that quick. And HIV infection rates are down 27 percent: 600,000 less people a year are getting HIV in sub-Saharan Africa. The battle against malaria is being won, with deaths from malaria down 27 percent, according to the latest World Bank data. And malaria nets actually are playing a role in that. This shouldn't surprise us, because actually, everybody grows. If you go back to Imperial Rome in the Year 1 A.D., there was admittedly about 1,800 years where there wasn't an awful lot of growth. But then the people that the Romans would have called Scottish barbarians, my ancestors, were actually part of the Industrial Revolution, and in the 19th century, growth began to accelerate, and you saw that get quicker and quicker, and it's been impacting everyone. It doesn't matter if this is the jungles of Singapore or the tundra of northern Finland. Everybody gets involved. It's just a matter of when the inevitable happens.Among the reasons I think it's happening right now is the quality of the leadership across Africa. I think most of us would agree that in the 1990s, the greatest politician in the world was African, but I'm meeting brilliant people across the continent the entire time, and they're doing the reforms which have transformed the economic situation for their countries.And the West is engaging with that. The West has given debt forgiveness programs which have halved sub-Saharan debt from about 70 percent of GDP down to about 40. At the same time, our debt level's gone up to 120 and we're all feeling slightly miserable as a result. Politics gets weaker when debt is high. When public sector debt is low, governments don't have to choose between investing in education and health and paying interest on that debt you owe. And it's not just the public sector which is looking so good. The private sector as well. Again, in the West, we have private sector debt of 200 percent of GDP in Spain, the U.K., and the U.S. That's an awful lot of debt. Africa, many African countries, are sitting at 10 to 30 percent of GDP. If there's any continent that can do what China has done \u2014 China's at about 130 percent of GDP on that chart \u2014 if anyone can do what China has done in the last 30 years, it'll be Africa in the next 30.So they've got great government finances, great private sector debt. Does anyone recognize this? In fact, they do. Foreign direct investment has poured into Africa in the last 15 years. Back in the '70s, no one touched the continent with a barge pole. And this investment is actually Western-led. We hear a lot about China, and they do lend a lot of money, but 60 percent of the FDI in the last couple of years has come from Europe, America, Australia, Canada. Ten percent's come from India. And they're investing in energy. Africa produces 10 million barrels a day of oil now. It's the same as Saudi Arabia or Russia. And they're investing in telecoms, shopping malls. And this very encouraging story, I think, is partly demographic-led. And it's not just about African demographics. I'm showing you the number of 15- to 24-year-olds in various parts of the world, and the blue line is the one I want you to focus on for a second. Ten years ago, say you're Foxconn setting up an iPhone factory, by chance. You might choose China, which is the bulk of that East Asian blue line, where there's 200 million young people, and every year until 2010 that's getting bigger. Which means you're going to have new guys knocking on the door saying, \"Give us a job,\" and, \"I don't need a big pay rise, just please give me a job.\" Now, that's completely changed now. This decade, we're going to see a 20- to 30-percent fall in the number of 15- to 24-year-olds in China. So where do you set up your new factory? You look at South Asia, and people are. They're looking at Pakistan and Bangladesh, and they're also looking at Africa. And they're looking at Africa because that yellow line is showing you that the number of young Africans is going to continue to get bigger decade after decade after decade out to 2050.Now, there's a problem with lots of young people coming into any market, particularly when they're young men. A bit dangerous, sometimes. I think one of the crucial factors is how educated is that demographic? If you look at the red line here, what you're going to see is that in 1975, just nine percent of kids were in secondary school education in sub-Saharan Africa. Would you set up a factory in sub-Sahara in the mid-1970s? Nobody else did. They chose instead Turkey and Mexico to set up the textiles factories, because their education levels were 25 to 30 percent. Today, sub-Sahara is at the levels that Turkey and Mexico were at in 1975. They will get the textiles jobs that will take people out of rural poverty and put them on the road to industrialization and wealth.So what's Africa looking like today? This is how I look at Africa. It's a bit odd, because I'm an economist. Each little box is about a billion dollars, and you see that I pay an awful lot of attention to Nigeria sitting there in the middle. South Africa is playing a role. But when I'm thinking about the future, I'm actually most interested in Central, Western and Southern Africa. If I look at Africa by population, East Africa stands out as so much potential.And I'm showing you something else with these maps. I'm showing you democracy versus autocracy. Fragile democracies is the beige color. Strong democracies are the orange color. And what you'll see here is that most Africans are now living in democracies. Why does that matter? Because what people want is what politicians try, they don't always succeed, but they try and deliver. And what you've got is a reinforcing positive circle going on. In Ghana in the elections, in December 2012, the battle between the two candidates was over education. One guy offered free secondary school education to all, not just 30 percent. The other guy had to say, I'm going to build 50 new schools. He won by a margin. So democracy is encouraging governments to invest in education. Education is helping growth and investment, and that's giving budget revenues, which is giving governments more money, which is helping growth through education. It's a positive, virtuous circle.But I get asked this question, and this particular question makes me quite sad: It's, \"But what about corruption? How can you invest in Africa when there's corruption?\" And what makes me sad about it is that this graph here is showing you that the biggest correlation with corruption is wealth. When you're poor, corruption is not your biggest priority. And the countries on the right hand side, you'll see the per capita GDP, basically every country with a per capita GDP of, say, less than 5,000 dollars, has got a corruption score of roughly, what's that, about three? Three out of 10. That's not good. Every poor country is corrupt. Every rich country is relatively uncorrupt. How do you get from poverty and corruption to wealth and less corruption? You see the middle class grow. And the way to do that is to invest, not to say I'm not investing in that continent because there's too much corruption.Now, I don't want to be an apologist for corruption. I've been arrested because I refused to pay a bribe \u2014 not in Africa, actually. But what I'm saying here is that we can make a difference and we can do that by investing.Now I'm going to let you in on a little not-so-secret. Economists aren't great at forecasting. Because the question really is, what happens next? And if you go back to the year 2000, what you'll find is The Economist had a very famous cover, \"The Hopeless Continent,\" and what they'd done is they'd looked at growth in Africa over the previous 10 years \u2014 two percent \u2014 and they said, what's going to happen in the next 10 years? They assumed two percent, and that made it a pretty hopeless story, because population growth was two and a half. People got poorer in Africa in the 1990s. Now 2012, The Economist has a new cover, and what does that new cover show? That new cover shows, well, Africa rising, because the growth over the last 10 years has been about five and a half percent.I would like to see if you can all now become economists, because if growth for the last 10 years has been five and a half percent, what do you think the IMF is forecasting for the next five years of growth in Africa? Very good. I think you're secretly saying to your head, probably five and a half percent. You're all economists, and I think, like most economists, wrong. No offense.What I like to do is try and find the countries that are doing exactly what Africa has already done, and it means that jump from 1,800 years of nothing to whoof, suddenly shooting through the roof. India is one of those examples. This is Indian growth from 1960 to 2010. Ignore the scale on the bottom for a second. Actually, for the first 20 years, the '60s and '70s, India didn't really grow. It grew at two percent when population growth was about two and a half. If that's familiar, that's exactly what happened in sub-Sahara in the '80s and the '90s. And then something happened in 1980. Boom! India began to explode. It wasn't a \"Hindu rate of growth,\" \"democracies can't grow.\" Actually India could. And if I lay sub-Saharan growth on top of the Indian growth story, it's remarkably similar. Twenty years of not much growth and a trend line which is actually telling you that sub-Saharan African growth is slightly better than India. And if I then lay developing Asia on top of this, I'm saying India is 20 years ahead of Africa, I'm saying developing Asia is 10 years ahead of India, I can draw out some forecasts for the next 30 to 40 years which I think are better than the ones where you're looking backwards. And that tells me this: that Africa is going to go from a $2 trillion economy today to a $29 trillion economy by 2050. Now that's bigger than Europe and America put together in today's money. Life expectancy is going to go up by 13 years. The population's going to double from one billion to two billion, so household incomes are going to go up sevenfold in the next 35 years. And when I present this in Africa \u2014 Nairobi, Lagos, Accra \u2014 I get one question. \"Charlie, why are you so pessimistic?\"And you know what? Actually, I think they've got a point. Am I really saying that there can be nothing learned, yes from the positives in Asia and India, but also the negatives? Perhaps Africa can avoid some of the mistakes that have been made. Surely, the technologies that we're talking about here this last week, surely some of these can perhaps help Africa grow even faster? And I think here we can play a role. Because technology does let you help. You can go and download some of the great African literature from the Internet now. No, not right now, just 30 seconds. You can go and buy some of the great tunes. My iPod's full of them. Buy African products. Go on holiday and see for yourself the change that's happening. Invest. Perhaps hire people, give them the skills that they can take back to Africa, and their companies will grow an awful lot faster than most of ours here in the West. And then you and I can help make sure that for Africa, the 21st century is their century.Thank you very much.(Applause)", "id": 1851, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:12.532 --> 00:00:14.319\nAfrica is booming.\n\n00:00:14.319 --> 00:00:16.824\nPer capita incomes since the year 2000\n\n00:00:16.824 --> 00:00:18.424\nhave doubled,\n\n00:00:18.424 --> 00:00:21.799\nand this boom is impacting on everyone.\n\n00:00:21.799 --> 00:00:24.625\nLife expectancy has increased by one year\n\n00:00:24.625 --> 00:00:27.375\nevery three years for the last decade.\n\n00:00:27.375 --> 00:00:30.860\nThat means if an African child is born today,\n\n00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:32.648\nrather than three days ago,\n\n00:00:32.648 --> 00:00:34.535\nthey will get an extra day of life\n\n00:00:34.535 --> 00:00:36.558\nat the end of their lifespan.\n\n00:00:36.558 --> 00:00:38.349\nIt's that quick.\n\n00:00:38.349 --> 00:00:42.461\nAnd HIV infection rates are down 27 percent:\n\n00:00:42.461 --> 00:00:46.711\n600,000 less people a year are getting HIV\n\n00:00:46.711 --> 00:00:49.175\nin sub-Saharan Africa.\n\n00:00:49.175 --> 00:00:52.237\nThe battle against malaria is being won,\n\n00:00:52.237 --> 00:00:55.037\nwith deaths from malaria down 27 percent,\n\n00:00:55.037 --> 00:00:56.799\naccording to the latest World Bank data.\n\n00:00:56.799 --> 00:00:59.896\nAnd malaria nets actually are playing a role in that.\n\n00:00:59.896 --> 00:01:02.068\nThis shouldn't surprise us,\n\n00:01:02.068 --> 00:01:04.817\nbecause actually, everybody grows.\n\n00:01:04.817 --> 00:01:06.793\nIf you go back to Imperial Rome\n\n00:01:06.793 --> 00:01:08.998\nin the Year 1 A.D.,\n\n00:01:08.998 --> 00:01:11.296\nthere was admittedly about 1,800 years\n\n00:01:11.296 --> 00:01:13.543\nwhere there wasn't an awful lot of growth.\n\n00:01:13.543 --> 00:01:15.535\nBut then the people that the Romans\n\n00:01:15.535 --> 00:01:19.350\nwould have called Scottish barbarians, my ancestors,\n\n00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:21.470\nwere actually part of the Industrial Revolution,\n\n00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:24.158\nand in the 19th century, growth began to accelerate,\n\n00:01:24.158 --> 00:01:27.198\nand you saw that get quicker and quicker,\n\n00:01:27.198 --> 00:01:29.958\nand it's been impacting everyone.\n\n00:01:29.958 --> 00:01:32.573\nIt doesn't matter if this is the jungles of Singapore\n\n00:01:32.573 --> 00:01:34.823\nor the tundra of northern Finland.\n\n00:01:34.823 --> 00:01:37.744\nEverybody gets involved.

is that demographic?\n\n00:05:16.853 --> 00:05:18.785\nIf you look at the red line here,\n\n00:05:18.785 --> 00:05:20.461\nwhat you're going to see is that in 1975,\n\n00:05:20.461 --> 00:05:22.550\njust nine percent of kids\n\n00:05:22.550 --> 00:05:24.950\nwere in secondary school education\n\n00:05:24.950 --> 00:05:27.608\nin sub-Saharan Africa.\n\n00:05:27.608 --> 00:05:29.375\nWould you set up a factory\n\n00:05:29.375 --> 00:05:31.265\nin sub-Sahara in the mid-1970s?\n\n00:05:31.265 --> 00:05:32.585\nNobody else did.\n\n00:05:32.585 --> 00:05:35.238\nThey

00:05:42.093\nwere 25 to 30 percent.\n\n00:05:42.093 --> 00:05:45.554\nToday, sub-Sahara is at the levels\n\n00:05:45.554 --> 00:05:49.290\nthat Turkey and Mexico were at in 1975.\n\n00:05:49.290 --> 00:05:52.469\nThey will get the textiles jobs\n\n00:05:52.469 --> 00:05:55.149\nthat will take people out of rural poverty\n\n00:05:55.149 --> 00:05:59.813\nand put them on the road to industrialization and wealth.\n\n00:05:59.813 --> 00:06:02.872\nSo what's Africa looking like today?\n\n00:06:02.872 --> 00:06:04.533\nThis is how I look at Africa.\n\n00:06:04.533 --> 00:06:06.357\nIt's a bit odd, because I'm an economist.\n\n00:06:06.357 --> 00:06:08.268\nEach little box is about a billion dollars,\n\n00:06:08.268 --> 00:06:09.985\nand you see that I pay an awful lot of attention\n\n00:06:09.985 --> 00:06:12.277\nto Nigeria sitting there in the middle.\n\n00:06:12.277 --> 00:06:14.442\nSouth Africa is playing a role.\n\n00:06:14.442 --> 00:06:16.521\nBut when I'm thinking about the future,\n\n00:06:16.521 --> 00:06:19.072\nI'm actually most interested\n\n00:06:19.072 --> 00:06:21.837\nin Central, Western and Southern Africa.\n\n00:06:21.837 --> 00:06:24.399\nIf I look at Africa by population,\n\n00:06:24.399 --> 00:06:25.768\nEast Africa stands out\n\n00:06:25.768 --> 00:06:27.752\nas so much potential.\n\n00:06:27.752 --> 00:06:30.784\nAnd I'm showing you something else with these maps.\n\n00:06:30.784 --> 00:06:33.526\nI'm showing you democracy versus autocracy.\n\n00:06:33.526 --> 00:06:36.779\nFragile democracies is the beige color.\n\n00:06:36.779 --> 00:06:39.422\nStrong democracies are the orange color.\n\n00:06:39.422 --> 00:06:42.152\nAnd what you'll see here is that most Africans\n\n00:06:42.152 --> 00:06:45.971\nare now living in democracies.\n\n00:06:45.971 --> 00:06:48.147\nWhy does that matter?\n\n00:06:48.147 --> 00:06:50.581\nBecause what people want\n\n00:06:50.581 --> 00:06:52.716\nis what politicians try,\n\n00:06:52.716 --> 00:06:55.807\nthey don't always succeed, but they try and deliver.\n\n00:06:55.807 --> 00:06:58.454\nAnd what you've got is a reinforcing positive circle going on.\n\n00:06:58.454 --> 00:07:01.330\nIn Ghana in the elections, in December 2012,\n\n00:07:01.330 --> 00:07:03.560\nthe battle between the two candidates\n\n00:07:03.560 --> 00:07:06.833\nwas over education.\n\n00:07:06.833 --> 00:07:08.826\nOne guy offered free secondary school education\n\n00:07:08.826 --> 00:07:11.174\nto all, not just 30 percent.\n\n00:07:11.174 --> 00:07:12.493\nThe other guy had to say,\n\n00:07:12.493 --> 00:07:14.620\nI'm going to build 50 new schools.\n\n00:07:14.620 --> 00:07:17.479\nHe won by a margin.\n\n00:07:17.479 --> 00:07:20.529\nSo democracy is encouraging governments\n\n00:07:20.529 --> 00:07:22.129\nto invest in education.\n\n00:07:22.129 --> 00:07:24.214\nEducation is helping growth and investment,\n\n00:07:24.214 --> 00:07:25.626\nand that's giving budget revenues,\n\n00:07:25.626 --> 00:07:27.465\nwhich is giving governments more money,\n\n00:07:27.465 --> 00:07:30.671\nwhich is helping growth through education.\n\n00:07:30.671 --> 00:07:33.206\nIt's a positive, virtuous circle.\n\n00:07:33.206 --> 00:07:35.767\nBut I get asked this question,\n\n00:07:35.767 --> 00:07:38.853\nand this particular question makes me quite sad:\n\n00:07:38.853 --> 00:07:41.384\nIt's, \"But what about corruption?\n\n00:07:41.384 --> 00:07:45.488\nHow can you invest in Africa when there's corruption?\"\n\n00:07:45.488 --> 00:07:47.129\nAnd what makes me sad about it\n\n00:07:47.129 --> 00:07:49.154\nis that this graph here is showing you\n\n00:07:49.154 --> 00:07:53.119\nthat the biggest correlation with corruption is wealth.\n\n00:07:53.119 --> 00:07:57.665\nWhen you're poor, corruption is not your biggest priority.\n\n00:07:57.665 --> 00:07:59.778\nAnd the countries on the right hand side,\n\n00:07:59.778 --> 00:08:01.501\nyou'll see the per capita GDP,\n\n00:08:01.501 --> 00:08:03.326\nbasically every country\n\n00:08:03.326 --> 00:08:06.821\nwith a per capita GDP of, say, less than 5,000 dollars,\n\n00:08:06.821 --> 00:08:09.041\nhas got a corruption score\n\n00:08:09.041 --> 00:08:12.076\nof roughly, what's that, about three?\n\n00:08:12.076 --> 00:08:14.359\nThree out of 10. That's not good.\n\n00:08:14.359 --> 00:08:16.707\nEvery poor country is corrupt.\n\n00:08:16.723 --> 00:08:20.849\nEvery rich country is relatively uncorrupt.\n\n00:08:20.849 --> 00:08:24.852\nHow do you get from poverty and corruption\n\n00:08:24.852 --> 00:08:27.121\nto wealth and less corruption?\n\n00:08:27.121 --> 00:08:29.313\nYou see the middle class grow.\n\n00:08:29.313 --> 00:08:32.800\nAnd the way to do that is to invest,\n\n00:08:32.800 --> 00:08:36.180\nnot to say I'm not investing in that continent\n\n00:08:36.180 --> 00:08:38.457\nbecause there's too much corruption.\n\n00:08:38.457 --> 00:08:41.134\nNow, I don't want to be an apologist for corruption.\n\n00:08:41.134 --> 00:08:44.073\nI've been arrested because I refused to pay a bribe --\n\n00:08:44.073 --> 00:08:46.185\nnot in Africa, actually.\n\n00:08:46.185 --> 00:08:47.883\nBut what I'm saying here is that\n\n00:08:47.883 --> 00:08:49.673\nwe can make a difference\n\n00:08:49.673 --> 00:08:52.579\nand we can do that by investing.\n\n00:08:52.579 --> 00:08:56.086\nNow I'm going to let you in on a little not-so-secret.\n\n00:08:56.086 --> 00:08:58.953\nEconomists aren't great at forecasting.\n\n00:08:58.953 --> 00:09:01.065\nBecause the question really is, what happens next?\n\n00:09:01.065 --> 00:09:03.589\nAnd if you go back to the year 2000,\n\n00:09:03.589 --> 00:09:05.352\nwhat you'll find is The Economist\n\n00:09:05.352 --> 00:09:08.520\nhad a very famous cover, \"The Hopeless Continent,\"\n\n00:09:08.520 --> 00:09:10.702\nand what they'd done is they'd looked at growth\n\n00:09:10.702 --> 00:09:14.832\nin Africa over the previous 10 years -- two percent --\n\n00:09:14.832 --> 00:09:16.936\nand they said,\n\n00:09:16.936 --> 00:09:19.469\nwhat's going to happen in the next 10 years?\n\n00:09:19.469 --> 00:09:21.848\nThey assumed two percent,\n\n00:09:21.848 --> 00:09:23.741\nand that made it a pretty hopeless story,\n\n00:09:23.741 --> 00:09:26.891\nbecause population growth was two and a half.\n\n00:09:26.891 --> 00:09:29.671\nPeople got poorer in Africa in the 1990s.\n\n00:09:29.671 --> 00:09:33.109\nNow 2012, The Economist has a new cover,\n\n00:09:33.109 --> 00:09:34.955\nand what does that new cover show?\n\n00:09:34.955 --> 00:09:37.938\nThat new cover shows, well, Africa rising,\n\n00:09:37.938 --> 00:09:39.665\nbecause the growth over the last 10 years\n\n00:09:39.665 --> 00:09:42.285\nhas been about five and a half percent.\n\n00:09:42.285 --> 00:09:45.811\nI would like to see if you can all now become economists,\n\n00:09:45.811 --> 00:09:48.326\nbecause if growth for the last 10 years\n\n00:09:48.326 --> 00:09:50.446\nhas been five and a half percent,\n\n00:09:50.446 --> 00:09:52.149\nwhat do you think the IMF is forecasting\n\n00:09:52.149 --> 00:09:55.169\nfor the next five years of growth in Africa?\n\n00:09:55.169 --> 00:09:57.944\nVery good. I think you're secretly saying\n\n00:09:57.944 --> 00:10:00.126\nto your head, probably five and a half percent.\n\n00:10:00.126 --> 00:10:02.068\nYou're all economists, and I think,\n\n00:10:02.068 --> 00:10:04.550\nlike most economists, wrong.\n\n00:10:04.550 --> 00:10:06.646\nNo offense.\n\n00:10:06.646 --> 00:10:09.527\nWhat I like to do is try and find the countries\n\n00:10:09.527 --> 00:10:13.688\nthat are doing exactly what Africa has already done,\n\n00:10:13.688 --> 00:10:17.086\nand it means that jump from 1,800 years of nothing\n\n00:10:17.086 --> 00:10:20.133\nto whoof, suddenly shooting through the roof.\n\n00:10:20.133 --> 00:10:22.787\nIndia is one of those examples.\n\n00:10:22.787 --> 00:10:26.906\nThis is Indian growth from 1960 to 2010.\n\n00:10:26.906 --> 00:10:29.820\nIgnore the scale on the bottom for a second.\n\n00:10:29.820 --> 00:10:32.190\nActually, for the first 20 years,\n\n00:10:32.190 --> 00:10:35.233\nthe '60s and '70s, India didn't really grow.\n\n00:10:35.233 --> 00:10:37.294\nIt grew at two percent\n\n00:10:37.294 --> 00:10:40.374\nwhen population growth was about two and a half.\n\n00:10:40.374 --> 00:10:42.554\nIf that's familiar, that's exactly what happened\n\n00:10:42.554 --> 00:10:44.849\nin sub-Sahara in the '80s and the '90s.\n\n00:10:44.849 --> 00:10:46.623\nAnd then something happened in 1980.\n\n00:10:46.623 --> 00:10:48.846\nBoom! India began to explode.\n\n00:10:48.846 --> 00:10:51.130\nIt wasn't a \"Hindu rate of growth,\"\n\n00:10:51.130 --> 00:10:54.186\n\"democracies can't grow.\" Actually India could.\n\n00:10:54.186 --> 00:10:56.992\nAnd if I lay sub-Saharan growth\n\n00:10:56.992 --> 00:10:59.260\non top of the Indian growth story,\n\n00:10:59.260 --> 00:11:01.876\nit's remarkably similar.\n\n00:11:01.876 --> 00:11:04.163\nTwenty years of not much growth\n\n00:11:04.163 --> 00:11:05.717\nand a trend line which is actually telling you\n\n00:11:05.717 --> 00:11:07.707\nthat sub-Saharan African growth is\n\n00:11:07.707 --> 00:11:10.268\nslightly better than India.\n\n00:11:10.268 --> 00:11:13.703\nAnd if I then lay developing Asia on top of this,\n\n00:11:13.703 --> 00:11:16.527\nI'm saying India is 20 years ahead of Africa,\n\n00:11:16.527 --> 00:11:20.633\nI'm saying developing Asia is 10 years ahead of India,\n\n00:11:20.633 --> 00:11:22.810\nI can draw out some forecasts\n\n00:11:22.810 --> 00:11:25.130\nfor the next 30 to 40 years\n\n00:11:25.130 --> 00:11:27.200\nwhich I think are better\n\n00:11:27.200 --> 00:11:30.052\nthan the ones where you're looking backwards.\n\n00:11:30.052 --> 00:11:32.399\nAnd that tells me this:\n\n00:11:32.399 --> 00:11:34.181\nthat Africa is going to go\n\n00:11:34.181 --> 00:11:37.218\nfrom a $2 trillion economy today\n\n00:11:37.218 --> 00:11:41.490\nto a $29 trillion economy by 2050.\n\n00:11:41.490 --> 00:11:43.498\nNow that's bigger than Europe and America\n\n00:11:43.498 --> 00:11:46.956\nput together in today's money.\n\n00:11:46.956 --> 00:11:50.876\nLife expectancy is going to go up by 13 years.\n\n00:11:50.876 --> 00:11:52.614\nThe population's going to double\n\n00:11:52.614 --> 00:11:54.067\nfrom one billion to two billion,\n\n00:11:54.067 --> 00:11:57.417\nso household incomes are going to go up sevenfold\n\n00:11:57.417 --> 00:12:00.281\nin the next 35 years.\n\n00:12:00.281 --> 00:12:03.398\nAnd when I present this in Africa --\n\n00:12:03.398 --> 00:12:07.202\nNairobi, Lagos, Accra -- I get one question.\n\n00:12:07.202 --> 00:12:12.070\n\"Charlie, why are you so pessimistic?\"\n\n00:12:12.070 --> 00:12:13.913\nAnd you know what?\n\n00:12:13.913 --> 00:12:16.302\nActually, I think they've got a point.\n\n00:12:16.302 --> 00:12:18.774\nAm I really saying that there can be nothing learned,\n\n00:12:18.774 --> 00:12:22.058\nyes from the positives in Asia and India,\n\n00:12:22.058 --> 00:12:23.436\nbut also the negatives?\n\n00:12:23.436 --> 00:12:25.998\nPerhaps Africa can avoid some of the mistakes that have been made.\n\n00:12:25.998 --> 00:12:29.393\nSurely, the technologies that we're talking about here\n\n00:12:29.393 --> 00:12:31.002\nthis last week,\n\n00:12:31.002 --> 00:12:32.946\nsurely some of these can perhaps\n\n00:12:32.946 --> 00:12:35.674\nhelp Africa grow even faster?\n\n00:12:35.674 --> 00:12:38.109\nAnd I think here we can play a role.\n\n00:12:38.109 --> 00:12:40.952\nBecause technology does let you help.\n\n00:12:40.952 --> 00:12:43.091\nYou can go and download\n\n00:12:43.091 --> 00:12:45.126\nsome of the great African literature\n\n00:12:45.126 --> 00:12:46.925\nfrom the Internet now.\n\n00:12:46.925 --> 00:12:49.398\nNo, not right now, just 30 seconds.\n\n00:12:49.398 --> 00:12:51.588\nYou can go and buy some of the great tunes.\n\n00:12:51.588 --> 00:12:53.319\nMy iPod's full of them.\n\n00:12:53.319 --> 00:12:55.009\nBuy African products.\n\n00:12:55.009 --> 00:12:56.974\nGo on holiday and see for yourself\n\n00:12:56.974 --> 00:12:58.523\nthe change that's happening.\n\n00:12:58.523 --> 00:12:59.928\nInvest.\n\n00:12:59.928 --> 00:13:02.054\nPerhaps hire people, give them the skills\n\n00:13:02.054 --> 00:13:04.323\nthat they can take back to Africa,\n\n00:13:04.323 --> 00:13:06.588\nand their companies will grow an awful lot faster\n\n00:13:06.588 --> 00:13:09.238\nthan most of ours here in the West.\n\n00:13:09.238 --> 00:13:13.539\nAnd then you and I can help make sure\n\n00:13:13.539 --> 00:13:17.668\nthat for Africa, the 21st century is their century.\n\n00:13:17.668 --> 00:13:19.478\nThank you very much.\n\n00:13:19.478 --> 00:13:23.478\n(Applause)"}, {"title": "An ode to envy", "duration": "791", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/parul_sehgal_an_ode_to_envy", "transcript": "So when I was eight years old, a new girl came to join the class, and she was so impressive, as the new girl always seems to be. She had vast quantities of very shiny hair and a cute little pencil case, super strong on state capitals, just a great speller. And I just curdled with jealousy that year, until I hatched my devious plan. So one day I stayed a little late after school, a little too late, and I lurked in the girls' bathroom. When the coast was clear, I emerged, crept into the classroom, and took from my teacher's desk the grade book. And then I did it. I fiddled with my rival's grades, just a little, just demoted some of those A's. All of those A's. (Laughter) And I got ready to return the book to the drawer, when hang on, some of my other classmates had appallingly good grades too. So, in a frenzy, I corrected everybody's marks, not imaginatively. I gave everybody a row of D's and I gave myself a row of A's, just because I was there, you know, might as well.And I am still baffled by my behavior. I don't understand where the idea came from. I don't understand why I felt so great doing it. I felt great. I don't understand why I was never caught. I mean, it should have been so blatantly obvious. I was never caught. But most of all, I am baffled by, why did it bother me so much that this little girl, this tiny little girl, was so good at spelling? Jealousy baffles me. It's so mysterious, and it's so pervasive. We know babies suffer from jealousy. We know primates do. Bluebirds are actually very prone. We know that jealousy is the number one cause of spousal murder in the United States. And yet, I have never read a study that can parse to me its loneliness or its longevity or its grim thrill. For that, we have to go to fiction, because the novel is the lab that has studied jealousy in every possible configuration. In fact, I don't know if it's an exaggeration to say that if we didn't have jealousy, would we even have literature? Well no faithless Helen, no \"Odyssey.\" No jealous king, no \"Arabian Nights.\" No Shakespeare. There goes high school reading lists, because we're losing \"Sound and the Fury,\" we're losing \"Gatsby,\" \"Sun Also Rises,\" we're losing \"Madame Bovary,\" \"Anna K.\" No jealousy, no Proust. And now, I mean, I know it's fashionable to say that Proust has the answers to everything, but in the case of jealousy, he kind of does. This year is the centennial of his masterpiece, \"In Search of Lost Time,\" and it's the most exhaustive study of sexual jealousy and just regular competitiveness, my brand, that we can hope to have. (Laughter) And we think about Proust, we think about the sentimental bits, right? We think about a little boy trying to get to sleep. We think about a madeleine moistened in lavender tea. We forget how harsh his vision was. We forget how pitiless he is. I mean, these are books that Virginia Woolf said were tough as cat gut. I don't know what cat gut is, but let's assume it's formidable.Let's look at why they go so well together, the novel and jealousy, jealousy and Proust. Is it something as obvious as that jealousy, which boils down into person, desire, impediment, is such a solid narrative foundation? I don't know. I think it cuts very close to the bone, because let's think about what happens when we feel jealous. When we feel jealous, we tell ourselves a story. We tell ourselves a story about other people's lives, and these stories make us feel terrible because they're designed to make us feel terrible. As the teller of the tale and the audience, we know just what details to include, to dig that knife in. Right? Jealousy makes us all amateur novelists, and this is something Proust understood.In the first volume, Swann's Way, the series of books, Swann, one of the main characters, is thinking very fondly of his mistress and how great she is in bed, and suddenly, in the course of a few sentences, and these are Proustian sentences, so they're long as rivers, but in the course of a few sentences, he suddenly recoils and he realizes, \"Hang on, everything I love about this woman, somebody else would love about this woman. Everything that she does that gives me pleasure could be giving somebody else pleasure, maybe right about now.\" And this is the story he starts to tell himself, and from then on, Proust writes that every fresh charm Swann detects in his mistress, he adds to his \"collection of instruments in his private torture chamber.\"Now Swann and Proust, we have to admit, were notoriously jealous. You know, Proust's boyfriends would have to leave the country if they wanted to break up with him. But you don't have to be that jealous to concede that it's hard work. Right? Jealousy is exhausting. It's a hungry emotion. It must be fed.And what does jealousy like? Jealousy likes information. Jealousy likes details. Jealousy likes the vast quantities of shiny hair, the cute little pencil case. Jealousy likes photos. That's why Instagram is such a hit. (Laughter) Proust actually links the language of scholarship and jealousy. When Swann is in his jealous throes, and suddenly he's listening at doorways and bribing his mistress' servants, he defends these behaviors. He says, \"You know, look, I know you think this is repugnant, but it is no different from interpreting an ancient text or looking at a monument.\" He says, \"They are scientific investigations with real intellectual value.\" Proust is trying to show us that jealousy feels intolerable and makes us look absurd, but it is, at its crux, a quest for knowledge, a quest for truth, painful truth, and actually, where Proust is concerned, the more painful the truth, the better. Grief, humiliation, loss: These were the avenues to wisdom for Proust. He says, \"A woman whom we need, who makes us suffer, elicits from us a gamut of feelings far more profound and vital than a man of genius who interests us.\" Is he telling us to just go and find cruel women? No. I think he's trying to say that jealousy reveals us to ourselves. And does any other emotion crack us open in this particular way? Does any other emotion reveal to us our aggression and our hideous ambition and our entitlement? Does any other emotion teach us to look with such peculiar intensity?Freud would write about this later. One day, Freud was visited by this very anxious young man who was consumed with the thought of his wife cheating on him. And Freud says, it's something strange about this guy, because he's not looking at what his wife is doing. Because she's blameless; everybody knows it. The poor creature is just under suspicion for no cause. But he's looking for things that his wife is doing without noticing, unintentional behaviors. Is she smiling too brightly here, or did she accidentally brush up against a man there? [Freud] says that the man is becoming the custodian of his wife's unconscious.The novel is very good on this point. The novel is very good at describing how jealousy trains us to look with intensity but not accuracy. In fact, the more intensely jealous we are, the more we become residents of fantasy. And this is why, I think, jealousy doesn't just provoke us to do violent things or illegal things. Jealousy prompts us to behave in ways that are wildly inventive. Now I'm thinking of myself at eight, I concede, but I'm also thinking of this story I heard on the news. A 52-year-old Michigan woman was caught creating a fake Facebook account from which she sent vile, hideous messages to herself for a year. For a year. A year. And she was trying to frame her ex-boyfriend's new girlfriend, and I have to confess when I heard this, I just reacted with admiration. (Laughter) Because, I mean, let's be real. What immense, if misplaced, creativity. Right? This is something from a novel. This is something from a Patricia Highsmith novel.Now Highsmith is a particular favorite of mine. She is the very brilliant and bizarre woman of American letters. She's the author of \"Strangers on a Train\" and \"The Talented Mr. Ripley,\" books that are all about how jealousy, it muddles our minds, and once we're in the sphere, in that realm of jealousy, the membrane between what is and what could be can be pierced in an instant. Take Tom Ripley, her most famous character. Now, Tom Ripley goes from wanting you or wanting what you have to being you and having what you once had, and you're under the floorboards, he's answering to your name, he's wearing your rings, emptying your bank account. That's one way to go.But what do we do? We can't go the Tom Ripley route. I can't give the world D's, as much as I would really like to, some days. And it's a pity, because we live in envious times. We live in jealous times. I mean, we're all good citizens of social media, aren't we, where the currency is envy?Does the novel show us a way out? I'm not sure. So let's do what characters always do when they're not sure, when they are in possession of a mystery. Let's go to 221B Baker Street and ask for Sherlock Holmes. When people think of Holmes, they think of his nemesis being Professor Moriarty, right, this criminal mastermind. But I've always preferred [Inspector] Lestrade, who is the rat-faced head of Scotland Yard who needs Holmes desperately, needs Holmes' genius, but resents him. Oh, it's so familiar to me. So Lestrade needs his help, resents him, and sort of seethes with bitterness over the course of the mysteries. But as they work together, something starts to change, and finally in \"The Adventure of the Six Napoleons,\" once Holmes comes in, dazzles everybody with his solution, Lestrade turns to Holmes and he says, \"We're not jealous of you, Mr. Holmes. We're proud of you.\" And he says that there's not a man at Scotland Yard who wouldn't want to shake Sherlock Holmes' hand.It's one of the few times we see Holmes moved in the mysteries, and I find it very moving, this little scene, but it's also mysterious, right? It seems to treat jealousy as a problem of geometry, not emotion. You know, one minute Holmes is on the other side from Lestrade. The next minute they're on the same side. Suddenly, Lestrade is letting himself admire this mind that he's resented. Could it be so simple though? What if jealousy really is a matter of geometry, just a matter of where we allow ourselves to stand in relation to another? Well, maybe then we wouldn't have to resent somebody's excellence. We could align ourselves with it.But I like contingency plans. So while we wait for that to happen, let us remember that we have fiction for consolation. Fiction alone demystifies jealousy. Fiction alone domesticates it, invites it to the table. And look who it gathers: sweet Lestrade, terrifying Tom Ripley, crazy Swann, Marcel Proust himself. We are in excellent company. Thank you.

And now, I mean,\n\n00:03:08.108 --> 00:03:09.869\nI know it's fashionable to say that Proust\n\n00:03:09.869 --> 00:03:11.476\nhas the answers to everything,\n\n00:03:11.476 --> 00:03:14.182\nbut in the case of jealousy,\n\n00:03:14.182 --> 00:03:16.923\nhe kind of does.\n\n00:03:16.923 --> 00:03:20.909\nThis year is the centennial of his masterpiece, \"In Search of Lost Time,\"\n\n00:03:20.909 --> 00:03:24.910\nand it's the most exhaustive study of sexual jealousy\n\n00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:27.062\nand just regular competitiveness, my brand,\n\n00:03:27.062 --> 00:03:29.647\nthat we can hope to have. (Laughter)\n\n00:03:29.647 --> 00:03:32.074\nAnd we think about Proust, we think\n\n00:03:32.074 --> 00:03:33.568\nabout the sentimental bits, right?\n\n00:03:33.568 --> 00:03:35.523\nWe think about a little boy trying to get to sleep.\n\n00:03:35.523 --> 00:03:39.704\nWe think about a madeleine moistened in lavender tea.\n\n00:03:39.704 --> 00:03:41.730\nWe forget how harsh his vision was.\n\n00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:43.570\nWe forget how pitiless he is.\n\n00:03:43.570 --> 00:03:45.891\nI mean, these are books that Virginia Woolf said\n\n00:03:45.891 --> 00:03:48.227\nwere tough as cat gut.\n\n00:03:48.227 --> 00:03:50.275\nI don't know what cat gut is,\n\n00:03:50.275 --> 00:03:53.176\nbut let's assume it's formidable.\n\n00:03:53.176 --> 00:03:56.394\nLet's look at why they go so well together,\n\n00:03:56.394 --> 00:04:00.072\nthe novel and jealousy, jealousy and Proust.\n\n00:04:00.072 --> 00:04:03.303\nIs it something as obvious as that jealousy,\n\n00:04:03.303 --> 00:04:06.686\nwhich boils down into person, desire, impediment,\n\n00:04:06.686 --> 00:04:11.354\nis such a solid narrative foundation?\n\n00:04:11.354 --> 00:04:14.029\nI don't know. I think it cuts very close to the bone,\n\n00:04:14.029 --> 00:04:16.078\nbecause let's think about what happens\n\n00:04:16.078 --> 00:04:17.856\nwhen we feel jealous.\n\n00:04:17.856 --> 00:04:21.808\nWhen we feel jealous, we tell ourselves a story.\n\n00:04:21.808 --> 00:04:26.091\nWe tell ourselves a story about other people's lives,\n\n00:04:26.091 --> 00:04:28.765\nand these stories make us feel terrible\n\n00:04:28.765 --> 00:04:30.988\nbecause they're designed to make us feel terrible.\n\n00:04:30.988 --> 00:04:33.522\nAs the teller of the tale and the audience,\n\n00:04:33.522 --> 00:04:35.496\nwe know just what details to include,\n\n00:04:35.496 --> 00:04:39.065\nto dig that knife in. Right?\n\n00:04:39.065 --> 00:04:42.420\nJealousy makes us all amateur novelists,\n\n00:04:42.420 --> 00:04:44.436\nand this is something Proust understood.\n\n00:04:44.436 --> 00:04:47.609\nIn the first volume, Swann's Way,\n\n00:04:47.609 --> 00:04:49.433\nthe series of books,\n\n00:04:49.433 --> 00:04:51.139\nSwann, one of the main characters,\n\n00:04:51.139 --> 00:04:54.367\nis thinking very fondly of his mistress\n\n00:04:54.367 --> 00:04:56.059\nand how great she is in bed,\n\n00:04:56.059 --> 00:04:59.101\nand suddenly, in the course of a few sentences,\n\n00:04:59.101 --> 00:05:01.142\nand these are Proustian sentences,\n\n00:05:01.142 --> 00:05:02.654\nso they're long as rivers,\n\n00:05:02.654 --> 00:05:04.917\nbut in the course of a few sentences,\n\n00:05:04.917 --> 00:05:07.324\nhe suddenly recoils and he realizes,\n\n00:05:07.324 --> 00:05:10.607\n\"Hang on, everything I love about this woman,\n\n00:05:10.607 --> 00:05:14.378\nsomebody else would love about this woman.\n\n00:05:14.378 --> 00:05:17.469\nEverything that she does that gives me pleasure\n\n00:05:17.469 --> 00:05:19.178\ncould be giving somebody else pleasure,\n\n00:05:19.178 --> 00:05:21.456\nmaybe right about now.\"\n\n00:05:21.456 --> 00:05:24.240\nAnd this is the story he starts to tell himself,\n\n00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:26.103\nand from then on, Proust writes that\n\n00:05:26.103 --> 00:05:29.150\nevery fresh charm Swann detects in his mistress,\n\n00:05:29.150 --> 00:05:31.814\nhe adds to his \"collection of instruments\n\n00:05:31.814 --> 00:05:35.436\nin his private torture chamber.\"\n\n00:05:35.436 --> 00:05:37.711\nNow Swann and Proust, we have to admit,\n\n00:05:37.711 --> 00:05:39.387\nwere notoriously jealous.\n\n00:05:39.387 --> 00:05:41.091\nYou know, Proust's boyfriends would have to leave\n\n00:05:41.091 --> 00:05:43.695\nthe country if they wanted to break up with him.\n\n00:05:43.695 --> 00:05:46.598\nBut you don't have to be that jealous\n\n00:05:46.598 --> 00:05:49.509\nto concede that it's hard work.

It was a historical day. There's no doubt that from now on, the Fourth of July will be remembered not as the day of the Declaration of Independence, but as the day of the discovery of the Higgs boson. Well, at least, here at CERN.But for me, the biggest surprise of that day was that there was no big surprise. In the eye of a theoretical physicist, the Higgs boson is a clever explanation of how some elementary particles gain mass, but it seems a fairly unsatisfactory and incomplete solution. Too many questions are left unanswered. The Higgs boson does not share the beauty, the symmetry, the elegance, of the rest of the elementary particle world. For this reason, the majority of theoretical physicists believe that the Higgs boson could not be the full story. We were expecting new particles and new phenomena accompanying the Higgs boson. Instead, so far, the measurements coming from the LHC show no signs of new particles or unexpected phenomena.Of course, the verdict is not definitive. In 2015, the LHC will almost double the energy of the colliding protons, and these more powerful collisions will allow us to explore further the particle world, and we will certainly learn much more.But for the moment, since we have found no evidence for new phenomena, let us suppose that the particles that we know today, including the Higgs boson, are the only elementary particles in nature, even at energies much larger than what we have explored so far. Let's see where this hypothesis is going to lead us. We will find a surprising and intriguing result about our universe, and to explain my point, let me first tell you what the Higgs is about, and to do so, we have to go back to one tenth of a billionth of a second after the Big Bang. And according to the Higgs theory, at that instant, a dramatic event took place in the universe. Space-time underwent a phase transition. It was something very similar to the phase transition that occurs when water turns into ice below zero degrees. But in our case, the phase transition is not a change in the way the molecules are arranged inside the material, but is about a change of the very fabric of space-time.During this phase transition, empty space became filled with a substance that we now call Higgs field. And this substance may seem invisible to us, but it has a physical reality. It surrounds us all the time, just like the air we breathe in this room. And some elementary particles interact with this substance, gaining energy in the process. And this intrinsic energy is what we call the mass of a particle, and by discovering the Higgs boson, the LHC has conclusively proved that this substance is real, because it is the stuff the Higgs bosons are made of. And this, in a nutshell, is the essence of the Higgs story.But this story is far more interesting than that. By studying the Higgs theory, theoretical physicists discovered, not through an experiment but with the power of mathematics, that the Higgs field does not necessarily exist only in the form that we observe today. Just like matter can exist as liquid or solid, so the Higgs field, the substance that fills all space-time, could exist in two states. Besides the known Higgs state, there could be a second state in which the Higgs field is billions and billions times denser than what we observe today, and the mere existence of another state of the Higgs field poses a potential problem. This is because, according to the laws of quantum mechanics, it is possible to have transitions between two states, even in the presence of an energy barrier separating the two states, and the phenomenon is called, quite appropriately, quantum tunneling. Because of quantum tunneling, I could disappear from this room and reappear in the next room, practically penetrating the wall. But don't expect me to actually perform the trick in front of your eyes, because the probability for me to penetrate the wall is ridiculously small. You would have to wait a really long time before it happens, but believe me, quantum tunneling is a real phenomenon, and it has been observed in many systems. For instance, the tunnel diode, a component used in electronics, works thanks to the wonders of quantum tunneling.But let's go back to the Higgs field. If the ultra-dense Higgs state existed, then, because of quantum tunneling, a bubble of this state could suddenly appear in a certain place of the universe at a certain time, and it is analogous to what happens when you boil water. Bubbles of vapor form inside the water, then they expand, turning liquid into gas. In the same way, a bubble of the ultra-dense Higgs state could come into existence because of quantum tunneling. The bubble would then expand at the speed of light, invading all space, and turning the Higgs field from the familiar state into a new state.Is this a problem? Yes, it's a big a problem. We may not realize it in ordinary life, but the intensity of the Higgs field is critical for the structure of matter. If the Higgs field were only a few times more intense, we would see atoms shrinking, neutrons decaying inside atomic nuclei, nuclei disintegrating, and hydrogen would be the only possible chemical element in the universe. And the Higgs field, in the ultra-dense Higgs state, is not just a few times more intense than today, but billions of times, and if space-time were filled by this Higgs state, all atomic matter would collapse. No molecular structures would be possible, no life.So, I wonder, is it possible that in the future, the Higgs field will undergo a phase transition and, through quantum tunneling, will be transformed into this nasty, ultra-dense state? In other words, I ask myself, what is the fate of the Higgs field in our universe? And the crucial ingredient necessary to answer this question is the Higgs boson mass. And experiments at the LHC found that the mass of the Higgs boson is about 126 GeV. This is tiny when expressed in familiar units, because it's equal to something like 10 to the minus 22 grams, but it is large in particle physics units, because it is equal to the weight of an entire molecule of a DNA constituent.So armed with this information from the LHC, together with some colleagues here at CERN, we computed the probability that our universe could quantum tunnel into the ultra-dense Higgs state, and we found a very intriguing result. Our calculations showed that the measured value of the Higgs boson mass is very special. It has just the right value to keep the universe hanging in an unstable situation. The Higgs field is in a wobbly configuration that has lasted so far but that will eventually collapse. So according to these calculations, we are like campers who accidentally set their tent at the edge of a cliff. And eventually, the Higgs field will undergo a phase transition and matter will collapse into itself.So is this how humanity is going to disappear? I don't think so. Our calculation shows that quantum tunneling of the Higgs field is not likely to occur in the next 10 to the 100 years, and this is a very long time. It's even longer than the time it takes for Italy to form a stable government.(Laughter)Even so, we will be long gone by then. In about five billion years, our sun will become a red giant, as large as the Earth's orbit, and our Earth will be kaput, and in a thousand billion years, if dark energy keeps on fueling space expansion at the present rate, you will not even be able to see as far as your toes, because everything around you expands at a rate faster than the speed of light. So it is really unlikely that we will be around to see the Higgs field collapse.But the reason why I am interested in the transition of the Higgs field is because I want to address the question, why is the Higgs boson mass so special? Why is it just right to keep the universe at the edge of a phase transition? Theoretical physicists always ask \"why\" questions. More than how a phenomenon works, theoretical physicists are always interested in why a phenomenon works in the way it works. We think that this these \"why\" questions can give us clues about the fundamental principles of nature. And indeed, a possible answer to my question opens up new universes, literally. It has been speculated that our universe is only a bubble in a soapy multiverse made out of a multitude of bubbles, and each bubble is a different universe with different fundamental constants and different physical laws. And in this context, you can only talk about the probability of finding a certain value of the Higgs mass. Then the key to the mystery could lie in the statistical properties of the multiverse. It would be something like what happens with sand dunes on a beach. In principle, you could imagine to find sand dunes of any slope angle in a beach, and yet, the slope angles of sand dunes are typically around 30, 35 degrees. And the reason is simple: because wind builds up the sand, gravity makes it fall. As a result, the vast majority of sand dunes have slope angles around the critical value, near to collapse. And something similar could happen for the Higgs boson mass in the multiverse. In the majority of bubble universes, the Higgs mass could be around the critical value, near to a cosmic collapse of the Higgs field, because of two competing effects, just as in the case of sand.My story does not have an end, because we still don't know the end of the story. This is science in progress, and to solve the mystery, we need more data, and hopefully, the LHC will soon add new clues to this story. Just one number, the Higgs boson mass, and yet, out of this number we learn so much. I started from a hypothesis, that the known particles are all there is in the universe, even beyond the domain explored so far. From this, we discovered that the Higgs field that permeates space-time may be standing on a knife edge, ready for cosmic collapse, and we discovered that this may be a hint that our universe is only a grain of sand in a giant beach, the multiverse.But I don't know if my hypothesis is right. That's how physics works: A single measurement can put us on the road to a new understanding of the universe or it can send us down a blind alley. But whichever it turns out to be, there is one thing I'm sure of: The journey will be full of surprises.Thank you.(Applause)", "id": 1853, "subtitle":

Collider\n\n00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:20.270\ndiscovered the Higgs boson.\n\n00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:22.238\nIt was a historical day.\n\n00:00:22.238 --> 00:00:24.533\nThere's no doubt that from now on,\n\n00:00:24.533 --> 00:00:26.367\nthe Fourth of July will be remembered\n\n00:00:26.367 --> 00:00:28.809\nnot as the day of the Declaration of Independence,\n\n00:00:28.809 --> 00:00:32.643\nbut as the day of the discovery of the Higgs boson.\n\n00:00:32.643 --> 00:00:35.075\nWell, at least, here at CERN.\n\n00:00:35.075 --> 00:00:39.230\nBut for me, the biggest surprise of that day\n\n00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:41.729\nwas that there was no big surprise.\n\n00:00:41.729 --> 00:00:44.328\nIn the eye of a theoretical physicist,\n\n00:00:44.328 --> 00:00:46.221\nthe Higgs boson is a clever explanation\n\n00:00:46.221 --> 00:00:49.744\nof how some elementary particles gain mass,\n\n00:00:49.744 --> 00:00:52.580\nbut it seems a fairly unsatisfactory\n\n00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:54.786\nand incomplete solution.\n\n00:00:54.786 --> 00:00:57.810\nToo many questions are left unanswered.\n\n00:00:57.810 --> 00:01:00.645\nThe Higgs boson does not share the beauty,\n\n00:01:00.645 --> 00:01:02.530\nthe symmetry, the elegance,\n\n00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:05.258\nof the rest of the elementary particle world.\n\n00:01:05.258 --> 00:01:08.880\nFor this reason, the majority of theoretical physicists\n\n00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:11.822\nbelieve that the Higgs boson could not\n\n00:01:11.822 --> 00:01:14.304\nbe the full story.\n\n00:01:14.304 --> 00:01:17.158\nWe were expecting new particles and new phenomena\n\n00:01:17.158 --> 00:01:19.608\naccompanying the Higgs boson.\n\n00:01:19.608 --> 00:01:21.926\nInstead, so far, the measurements\n\n00:01:21.926 --> 00:01:25.684\ncoming from the LHC show no signs of new particles\n\n00:01:25.684 --> 00:01:27.833\nor unexpected phenomena.\n\n00:01:27.833 --> 00:01:31.486\nOf course, the verdict is not definitive.\n\n00:01:31.486 --> 00:01:35.480\nIn 2015, the LHC will almost double\n\n00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:38.171\nthe energy of the colliding protons,\n\n00:01:38.171 --> 00:01:40.242\nand these more powerful collisions\n\n00:01:40.242 --> 00:01:44.826\nwill allow us to explore further the particle world,\n\n00:01:44.826 --> 00:01:47.958\nand we will certainly learn much more.\n\n00:01:47.958 --> 00:01:51.104\nBut for the moment, since we have found\n\n00:01:51.104 --> 00:01:54.253\nno evidence for new phenomena, let us suppose\n\n00:01:54.253 --> 00:01:57.417\nthat the particles that we know today,\n\n00:01:57.417 --> 00:01:59.273\nincluding the Higgs boson,\n\n00:01:59.273 --> 00:02:02.558\nare the only elementary particles in nature,\n\n00:02:02.558 --> 00:02:05.302\neven at energies much larger\n\n00:02:05.302 --> 00:02:08.068\nthan what we have explored so far.\n\n00:02:08.068 --> 00:02:12.700\nLet's see where this hypothesis is going to lead us.\n\n00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:16.132\nWe will find a surprising and intriguing result\n\n00:02:16.132 --> 00:02:19.931\nabout our universe, and to explain my point,\n\n00:02:19.931 --> 00:02:23.807\nlet me first tell you what the Higgs is about,\n\n00:02:23.807 --> 00:02:26.941\nand to do so, we have to go back\n\n00:02:26.941 --> 00:02:31.298\nto one tenth of a billionth of a second\n\n00:02:31.298 --> 00:02:32.829\nafter the Big Bang.\n\n00:02:32.829 --> 00:02:34.870\nAnd according to the Higgs theory,\n\n00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:38.236\nat that instant, a dramatic event took place\n\n00:02:38.236 --> 00:02:39.827\nin the universe.\n\n00:02:39.827 --> 00:02:44.618\nSpace-time underwent a phase transition.\n\n00:02:44.618 --> 00:02:47.695\nIt was something very similar to the phase transition\n\n00:02:47.695 --> 00:02:51.240\nthat occurs when water turns into ice\n\n00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:53.201\nbelow zero degrees.\n\n00:02:53.201 --> 00:02:56.141\nBut in our case, the phase transition\n\n00:02:56.141 --> 00:02:58.672\nis not a change in the way the molecules\n\n00:02:58.672 --> 00:03:00.958\nare arranged inside the material,\n\n00:03:00.958 --> 00:03:02.846\nbut is about a change\n\n00:03:02.846 --> 00:03:06.472\nof the very fabric of space-time.\n\n00:03:06.472 --> 00:03:09.098\nDuring this phase transition, empty space\n\n00:03:09.098 --> 00:03:11.770\nbecame filled with a substance\n\n00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:14.802\nthat we now call Higgs field.\n\n00:03:14.802 --> 00:03:17.131\nAnd this substance may seem invisible to us,\n\n00:03:17.131 --> 00:03:19.809\nbut it has a physical reality.\n\n00:03:19.809 --> 00:03:21.867\nIt surrounds us all the time,\n\n00:03:21.867 --> 00:03:25.568\njust like the air we breathe in this room.\n\n00:03:25.568 --> 00:03:27.886\nAnd some elementary particles interact\n\n00:03:27.886 --> 00:03:31.714\nwith this substance, gaining energy in the process.\n\n00:03:31.714 --> 00:03:34.789\nAnd this intrinsic energy is what we call\n\n00:03:34.789 --> 00:03:36.922\nthe mass of a particle,\n\n00:03:36.922 --> 00:03:40.175\nand by discovering the Higgs boson, the LHC\n\n00:03:40.175 --> 00:03:44.707\nhas conclusively proved that this substance is real,\n\n00:03:44.707 --> 00:03:48.626\nbecause it is the stuff the Higgs bosons are made of.\n\n00:03:48.626 --> 00:03:52.070\nAnd this, in a nutshell, is the essence of the Higgs story.\n\n00:03:52.070 --> 00:03:56.813\nBut this story is far more interesting than that.\n\n00:03:56.813 --> 00:03:59.124\nBy studying the Higgs theory,\n\n00:03:59.124 --> 00:04:01.484\ntheoretical physicists discovered,\n\n00:04:01.484 --> 00:04:03.388\nnot through an experiment\n\n00:04:03.388 --> 00:04:05.864\nbut with the power of mathematics,\n\n00:04:05.864 --> 00:04:09.576\nthat the Higgs field does not necessarily exist\n\n00:04:09.576 --> 00:04:12.913\nonly in the form that we observe today.\n\n00:04:12.913 --> 00:04:17.958\nJust like matter can exist as liquid or solid,\n\n00:04:17.958 --> 00:04:22.530\nso the Higgs field, the substance that fills all space-time,\n\n00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:25.884\ncould exist in two states.\n\n00:04:25.884 --> 00:04:28.194\nBesides the known Higgs state,\n\n00:04:28.194 --> 00:04:31.341\nthere could be a second state in which the Higgs field\n\n00:04:31.341 --> 00:04:34.877\nis billions and billions times denser\n\n00:04:34.877 --> 00:04:36.922\nthan what we observe today,\n\n00:04:36.922 --> 00:04:40.409\nand the mere existence of another state\n\n00:04:40.409 --> 00:04:44.654\nof the Higgs field poses a potential problem.\n\n00:04:44.654 --> 00:04:47.892\nThis is because, according to the laws\n\n00:04:47.892 --> 00:04:50.585\nof quantum mechanics, it is possible\n\n00:04:50.585 --> 00:04:53.417\nto have transitions between two states,\n\n00:04:53.417 --> 00:04:56.366\neven in the presence of an energy barrier\n\n00:04:56.366 --> 00:04:58.994\nseparating the two states,\n\n00:04:58.994 --> 00:05:01.203\nand the phenomenon is called,\n\n00:05:01.203 --> 00:05:05.345\nquite appropriately, quantum tunneling.\n\n00:05:05.345 --> 00:05:07.236\nBecause of quantum tunneling,\n\n00:05:07.236 --> 00:05:09.769\nI could disappear from this room\n\n00:05:09.769 --> 00:05:13.091\nand reappear in the next room,\n\n00:05:13.091 --> 00:05:16.486\npractically penetrating the wall.\n\n00:05:16.486 --> 00:05:19.301\nBut don't expect me to actually perform the trick\n\n00:05:19.301 --> 00:05:21.879\nin front of your eyes, because the probability\n\n00:05:21.879 --> 00:05:26.267\nfor me to penetrate the wall is ridiculously small.\n\n00:05:26.267 --> 00:05:28.865\nYou would have to wait a really long time\n\n00:05:28.865 --> 00:05:30.997\nbefore it happens, but believe me,\n\n00:05:30.997 --> 00:05:34.174\nquantum tunneling is a real phenomenon,\n\n00:05:34.174 --> 00:05:37.369\nand it has been observed in many systems.\n\n00:05:37.369 --> 00:05:39.931\nFor instance, the tunnel diode,\n\n00:05:39.931 --> 00:05:42.128\na component used in electronics,\n\n00:05:42.128 --> 00:05:44.550\nworks thanks to the wonders\n\n00:05:44.550 --> 00:05:46.870\nof quantum tunneling.\n\n00:05:46.870 --> 00:05:49.162\nBut let's go back to the Higgs field.\n\n00:05:49.162 --> 00:05:53.725\nIf the ultra-dense Higgs state existed,\n\n00:05:53.725 --> 00:05:56.079\nthen, because of quantum tunneling,\n\n00:05:56.079 --> 00:05:59.792\na bubble of this state could suddenly appear\n\n00:05:59.792 --> 00:06:03.034\nin a certain place of the universe at a certain time,\n\n00:06:03.034 --> 00:06:06.799\nand it is analogous to what happens when you boil water.\n\n00:06:06.799 --> 00:06:09.888\nBubbles of vapor form inside the water,\n\n00:06:09.888 --> 00:06:13.744\nthen they expand, turning liquid into gas.\n\n00:06:13.744 --> 00:06:18.548\nIn the same way, a bubble of the ultra-dense Higgs state\n\n00:06:18.548 --> 00:06:21.975\ncould come into existence because of quantum tunneling.\n\n00:06:21.975 --> 00:06:24.812\nThe bubble would then expand at the speed of light,\n\n00:06:24.812 --> 00:06:28.298\ninvading all space, and turning the Higgs field\n\n00:06:28.298 --> 00:06:31.947\nfrom the familiar state into a new state.\n\n00:06:31.947 --> 00:06:36.108\nIs this a problem? Yes, it's a big a problem.\n\n00:06:36.108 --> 00:06:38.853\nWe may not realize it in ordinary life,\n\n00:06:38.853 --> 00:06:42.058\nbut the intensity of the Higgs field is critical\n\n00:06:42.058 --> 00:06:44.703\nfor the structure of matter.\n\n00:06:44.703 --> 00:06:48.776\nIf the Higgs field were only a few times more intense,\n\n00:06:48.776 --> 00:06:51.720\nwe would see atoms shrinking, neutrons decaying\n\n00:06:51.720 --> 00:06:55.406\ninside atomic nuclei, nuclei disintegrating,\n\n00:06:55.406 --> 00:06:57.746\nand hydrogen would be\n\n00:06:57.746 --> 00:07:02.098\nthe only possible chemical element in the universe.\n\n00:07:02.098 --> 00:07:05.109\nAnd the Higgs field, in the ultra-dense Higgs state,\n\n00:07:05.109 --> 00:07:08.923\nis not just a few times more intense than today,\n\n00:07:08.923 --> 00:07:11.118\nbut billions of times,\n\n00:07:11.118 --> 00:07:14.320\nand if space-time were filled by this Higgs state,\n\n00:07:14.320 --> 00:07:17.473\nall atomic matter would collapse.\n\n00:07:17.473 --> 00:07:21.963\nNo molecular structures would be possible, no life.\n\n00:07:21.963 --> 00:07:25.301\nSo, I wonder, is it possible\n\n00:07:25.301 --> 00:07:27.887\nthat in the future, the Higgs field\n\n00:07:27.887 --> 00:07:30.452\nwill undergo a phase transition and,\n\n00:07:30.452 --> 00:07:33.581\nthrough quantum tunneling, will be transformed\n\n00:07:33.581 --> 00:07:38.268\ninto this nasty, ultra-dense state?\n\n00:07:38.268 --> 00:07:41.793\nIn other words, I ask myself, what is the fate\n\n00:07:41.793 --> 00:07:44.876\nof the Higgs field in our universe?\n\n00:07:44.876 --> 00:07:47.127\nAnd the crucial ingredient necessary\n\n00:07:47.127 --> 00:07:51.513\nto answer this question is the Higgs boson mass.\n\n00:07:51.513 --> 00:07:55.624\nAnd experiments at the LHC found that the mass\n\n00:07:55.624 --> 00:07:59.898\nof the Higgs boson is about 126 GeV.\n\n00:07:59.898 --> 00:08:02.934\nThis is tiny when expressed in familiar units,\n\n00:08:02.934 --> 00:08:04.254\nbecause it's equal to something like\n\n00:08:04.254 --> 00:08:06.461\n10 to the minus 22 grams,\n\n00:08:06.461 --> 00:08:10.431\nbut it is large in particle physics units,\n\n00:08:10.431 --> 00:08:12.535\nbecause it is equal to the weight\n\n00:08:12.535 --> 00:08:14.781\nof an entire molecule\n\n00:08:14.781 --> 00:08:17.201\nof a DNA constituent.\n\n00:08:17.201 --> 00:08:20.588\nSo armed with this information from the LHC,\n\n00:08:20.588 --> 00:08:22.532\ntogether with some colleagues here at CERN,\n\n00:08:22.532 --> 00:08:24.441\nwe computed the probability\n\n00:08:24.441 --> 00:08:27.456\nthat our universe could quantum tunnel\n\n00:08:27.456 --> 00:08:30.574\ninto the ultra-dense Higgs state,\n\n00:08:30.574 --> 00:08:34.251\nand we found a very intriguing result.\n\n00:08:34.251 --> 00:08:36.400\nOur calculations showed\n\n00:08:36.400 --> 00:08:39.572\nthat the measured value of the Higgs boson mass\n\n00:08:39.572 --> 00:08:41.417\nis very special.\n\n00:08:41.417 --> 00:08:44.336\nIt has just the right value\n\n00:08:44.336 --> 00:08:47.029\nto keep the universe hanging\n\n00:08:47.029 --> 00:08:49.599\nin an unstable situation.\n\n00:08:49.599 --> 00:08:52.855\nThe Higgs field is in a wobbly configuration\n\n00:08:52.855 --> 00:08:54.904\nthat has lasted so far\n\n00:08:54.904 --> 00:08:57.949\nbut that will eventually collapse.\n\n00:08:57.949 --> 00:09:01.128\nSo according to these calculations,\n\n00:09:01.128 --> 00:09:03.158\nwe are like campers\n\n00:09:03.158 --> 00:09:05.610\nwho accidentally set their tent\n\n00:09:05.610 --> 00:09:07.404\nat the edge of a cliff.\n\n00:09:07.404 --> 00:09:09.194\nAnd eventually, the Higgs field\n\n00:09:09.194 --> 00:09:11.130\nwill undergo a phase transition\n\n00:09:11.130 --> 00:09:14.174\nand matter will collapse into itself.\n\n00:09:14.174 --> 00:09:17.618\nSo is this how humanity is going to disappear?\n\n00:09:17.618 --> 00:09:19.373\nI don't think so.\n\n00:09:19.373 --> 00:09:22.726\nOur calculation shows that quantum tunneling\n\n00:09:22.726 --> 00:09:26.382\nof the Higgs field is not likely to occur\n\n00:09:26.382 --> 00:09:29.886\nin the next 10 to the 100 years,\n\n00:09:29.886 --> 00:09:32.928\nand this is a very long time.\n\n00:09:32.928 --> 00:09:34.696\nIt's even longer than\n\n00:09:34.696 --> 00:09:38.365\nthe time it takes for Italy to form a stable government.\n\n00:09:38.365 --> 00:09:40.772\n(Laughter)\n\n00:09:40.772 --> 00:09:44.563\nEven so, we will be long gone by then.\n\n00:09:44.563 --> 00:09:47.171\nIn about five billion years,\n\n00:09:47.171 --> 00:09:49.628\nour sun will become a red giant,\n\n00:09:49.628 --> 00:09:52.141\nas large as the Earth's orbit,\n\n00:09:52.141 --> 00:09:55.418\nand our Earth will be kaput,\n\n00:09:55.418 --> 00:09:57.775\nand in a thousand billion years,\n\n00:09:57.775 --> 00:10:00.061\nif dark energy keeps on fueling\n\n00:10:00.061 --> 00:10:02.896\nspace expansion at the present rate,\n\n00:10:02.896 --> 00:10:07.073\nyou will not even be able to see as far as your toes,\n\n00:10:07.073 --> 00:10:08.770\nbecause everything around you\n\n00:10:08.770 --> 00:10:12.471\nexpands at a rate faster than the speed of light.\n\n00:10:12.471 --> 00:10:14.456\nSo it is really unlikely\n\n00:10:14.456 --> 00:10:18.326\nthat we will be around to see the Higgs field collapse.\n\n00:10:18.326 --> 00:10:21.905\nBut the reason why I am interested\n\n00:10:21.905 --> 00:10:23.917\nin the transition of the Higgs field\n\n00:10:23.917 --> 00:10:27.202\nis because I want to address the question,\n\n00:10:27.202 --> 00:10:32.167\nwhy is the Higgs boson mass so special?\n\n00:10:32.167 --> 00:10:35.141\nWhy is it just right to keep the universe\n\n00:10:35.141 --> 00:10:38.631\nat the edge of a phase transition?\n\n00:10:38.631 --> 00:10:42.493\nTheoretical physicists always ask \"why\" questions.\n\n00:10:42.493 --> 00:10:45.168\nMore than how a phenomenon works,\n\n00:10:45.168 --> 00:10:47.640\ntheoretical physicists are always interested in\n\n00:10:47.640 --> 00:10:50.872\nwhy a phenomenon works in the way it works.\n\n00:10:50.872 --> 00:10:54.234\nWe think that this these \"why\" questions\n\n00:10:54.234 --> 00:10:55.957\ncan give us clues\n\n00:10:55.957 --> 00:10:59.495\nabout the fundamental principles of nature.\n\n00:10:59.495 --> 00:11:03.400\nAnd indeed, a possible answer to my question\n\n00:11:03.400 --> 00:11:07.764\nopens up new universes, literally.\n\n00:11:07.764 --> 00:11:11.205\nIt has been speculated that our universe\n\n00:11:11.205 --> 00:11:15.338\nis only a bubble in a soapy multiverse\n\n00:11:15.338 --> 00:11:17.901\nmade out of a multitude of bubbles,\n\n00:11:17.901 --> 00:11:20.117\nand each bubble is a different universe\n\n00:11:20.117 --> 00:11:22.011\nwith different fundamental constants\n\n00:11:22.011 --> 00:11:23.876\nand different physical laws.\n\n00:11:23.876 --> 00:11:25.882\nAnd in this context, you can only talk about\n\n00:11:25.882 --> 00:11:30.593\nthe probability of finding a certain value of the Higgs mass.\n\n00:11:30.593 --> 00:11:32.936\nThen the key to the mystery\n\n00:11:32.936 --> 00:11:36.199\ncould lie in the statistical properties\n\n00:11:36.199 --> 00:11:38.427\nof the multiverse.\n\n00:11:38.427 --> 00:11:40.841\nIt would be something like what happens\n\n00:11:40.841 --> 00:11:43.078\nwith sand dunes on a beach.\n\n00:11:43.078 --> 00:11:45.950\nIn principle, you could imagine to find sand dunes\n\n00:11:45.950 --> 00:11:48.380\nof any slope angle in a beach,\n\n00:11:48.380 --> 00:11:52.541\nand yet, the slope angles of sand dunes\n\n00:11:52.541 --> 00:11:56.011\nare typically around 30, 35 degrees.\n\n00:11:56.011 --> 00:11:57.679\nAnd the reason is simple:\n\n00:11:57.679 --> 00:12:01.357\nbecause wind builds up the sand, gravity makes it fall.\n\n00:12:01.357 --> 00:12:04.241\nAs a result, the vast majority of sand dunes\n\n00:12:04.241 --> 00:12:08.160\nhave slope angles around the critical value,\n\n00:12:08.160 --> 00:12:10.144\nnear to collapse.\n\n00:12:10.144 --> 00:12:13.141\nAnd something similar could happen\n\n00:12:13.141 --> 00:12:17.678\nfor the Higgs boson mass in the multiverse.\n\n00:12:17.678 --> 00:12:20.550\nIn the majority of bubble universes,\n\n00:12:20.550 --> 00:12:23.607\nthe Higgs mass could be around the critical value,\n\n00:12:23.607 --> 00:12:27.203\nnear to a cosmic collapse of the Higgs field,\n\n00:12:27.203 --> 00:12:29.150\nbecause of two competing effects,\n\n00:12:29.150 --> 00:12:32.736\njust as in the case of sand.\n\n00:12:32.736 --> 00:12:35.881\nMy story does not have an end,\n\n00:12:35.881 --> 00:12:39.616\nbecause we still don't know the end of the story.\n\n00:12:39.616 --> 00:12:42.904\nThis is science in progress,\n\n00:12:42.904 --> 00:12:46.738\nand to solve the mystery, we need more data,\n\n00:12:46.738 --> 00:12:51.354\nand hopefully, the LHC will soon add new clues\n\n00:12:51.354 --> 00:12:53.975\nto this story.\n\n00:12:53.975 --> 00:12:57.805\nJust one number, the Higgs boson mass,\n\n00:12:57.805 --> 00:13:03.134\nand yet, out of this number we learn so much.\n\n00:13:03.134 --> 00:13:06.181\nI started from a hypothesis, that the known particles\n\n00:13:06.181 --> 00:13:08.217\nare all there is in the universe,\n\n00:13:08.217 --> 00:13:10.923\neven beyond the domain explored so far.\n\n00:13:10.923 --> 00:13:14.691\nFrom this, we discovered that the Higgs field\n\n00:13:14.691 --> 00:13:18.134\nthat permeates space-time may be standing\n\n00:13:18.134 --> 00:13:22.691\non a knife edge, ready for cosmic collapse,\n\n00:13:22.691 --> 00:13:26.241\nand we discovered that this may be a hint\n\n00:13:26.241 --> 00:13:30.274\nthat our universe is only a grain of sand\n\n00:13:30.274 --> 00:13:33.887\nin a giant beach, the multiverse.\n\n00:13:33.887 --> 00:13:37.138\nBut I don't know if my hypothesis is right.\n\n00:13:37.138 --> 00:13:40.821\nThat's how physics works: A single measurement\n\n00:13:40.821 --> 00:13:43.685\ncan put us on the road to a new understanding\n\n00:13:43.685 --> 00:13:45.348\nof the universe\n\n00:13:45.348 --> 00:13:48.367\nor it can send us down a blind alley.\n\n00:13:48.367 --> 00:13:50.931\nBut whichever it turns out to be,\n\n00:13:50.931 --> 00:13:54.123\nthere is one thing I'm sure of:\n\n00:13:54.123 --> 00:13:57.472\nThe journey will be full of surprises.\n\n00:13:57.472 --> 00:13:58.845\nThank you.\n\n00:13:58.845 -->

"My work focuses on the connection of both thinking about our community life being part of the environment where architecture grows from the natural local conditions and traditions.Today I brought two recent projects as an example of this. Both projects are in emerging countries, one in Ethiopia and another one in Tunisia. And also they have in common that the different analyses from different perspectives becomes an essential part of the final piece of architecture.The first example started with an invitation to design a multistory shopping mall in Ethiopia's capital city Addis Ababa. And this is the type of building we were shown as an example, to my team and myself, of what we had to design. At first, the first thing I thought was, I want to run away.(Laughter)After seeing a few of these buildings \u2014 there are many in the city \u2014 we realized that they have three very big points. First, these buildings, they are almost empty because they have very large shops where people cannot afford to buy things. Second, they need tons of energy to perform because of the skin treatment with glass that creates heat in the inside, and then you need a lot of cooling. In a city where this shouldn't happen because they have really mild weather that ranges from 20 to 25 degrees the whole year. And third is that their image has nothing to do with Africa and with Ethiopia. It is a pity in a place that has such rich culture and traditions.Also during our first visit to Ethiopia, I was really captivated by the old merkato that is this open-air structure where thousands of people, they go and buy things every day from small vendors. And also it has this idea of the public space that uses the outdoors to create activity. So I thought, this is what I really want to design, not a shopping mall. But the question was how we could do a multistory, contemporary building with these principles.The next challenge was when we looked at the site, that is, in a really growing area of the city, where most of these buildings that you see in the image, they were not there. And it's also between two parallel streets that don't have any connection for hundreds of meters.So the first thing we did was to create a connection between these two streets, putting all the entrances of the building. And this extends with an inclined atrium that creates an open-air space in the building that self-protects itself with its own shape from the sun and the rain. And around this void we placed this idea of the market with small shops, that change in each floor because of the shape of the void.I also thought, how to close the building? And I really wanted to find a solution that would respond to the local climate conditions. And I started thinking about the textile like a shell made of concrete with perforations that would let the air in, and also the light, but in a filtered way. And then the inspiration came from these beautiful  patterns of the Ethiopian women's dresses. That they have fractal geometry properties and this helped me to shape the whole facade. And we are building that with these small prefabricated pieces that are the windows that let the air and the light in a controlled way inside the building. And this is complemented by these small colored glasses that use the light from the inside of the building to light up the building at night.With these ideas it was not easy first to convince the developers because they were like, \"This is not a shopping mall. We didn't ask for that.\" But then we all realized that this idea of the market happened to be a lot more profitable than the idea of the shopping mall because basically they had more shops to sell. And also that the idea of the facade was much, much cheaper, not only because of the material compared with the glass, but also because we didn't need to have air conditioning anymore. So we created some budget savings that we used to implement the project.And the first implementation was to think about how we could make the building self-sufficient in terms of energy in a city that has electricity cuts almost every day. So we created a huge asset by placing photovoltaics there on the roof. And then under those panels we thought about the roof like a new public space with gathering areas and bars that would create this urban oasis. And these porches on the roof, all together they collect the water to reuse for sanitation on the inside. Hopefully by the beginning of next year, because we are already on the fifth floor of the construction.The second example is a master plan of 2,000 apartments and facilities in the city of Tunis. And for doing such a big project, the biggest project I've ever designed, I really needed to understand the city of Tunis, but also its surroundings and the tradition and culture.During that analysis I paid special attention to the medina that is this 1,000-year-old structure that used to be closed by a wall, opened by twelve different gates, connected by almost straight lines. When I went to the site, the first design operation we did was to extend the existing streets, creating 12 initial blocks similar in size and characteristics to the ones we have in Barcelona and other cities in Europe with these courtyards. On top of that, we selected some strategic points reminded of this idea of the gates and connecting them by straight lines, and this modified this initial pattern.And the last operation was to think about the cell, the small cell of the project, like the apartment, as an essential part of the master plan. And for that I thought, what would be the best orientation in the Mediterranean climate for an apartment? And it's north-south, because it creates a thermal difference between both sides of the house and then a natural ventilation. So we overlap a pattern that makes sure that most of the apartments are perfectly oriented in that direction.And this is the result that is almost like a combination of the European block and the Arab city. It has these blocks with courtyards, and then on the ground floor you have all these connections for the pedestrians. And also it responds to the local regulations that establish a higher density on the upper levels and a lower density on the ground floor. And it also reinforces this idea of the gates.The volume has this connecting shape that shades itself with three different types of apartments and also lets the light go on the ground floor in a very dense neighborhood And in the courtyards there are the different facilities, such as a gym and a kindergarten and close by, a series of commercial [spaces] that bring activity to the ground floor. The roof, which is my favorite space of the project is almost like giving back to the community the space taken by the construction. And it's where all the neighbors, they can go up and socialize, and do activities such as having a two-kilometer run in the morning, jumping from one building to another.These two examples, they have a common approach in the design process. And also, they are in emerging countries where you can see the cities literally growing. In these cities, the impact of architecture in people's lives of today and tomorrow changes the local communities and economies at the same speed as the buildings grow. For this reason, I see even more importance to look at architecture finding simple but affordable solutions that enhance the relationship between the community and the environment and that aim to connect nature and people.Thank you very much.(Applause)", "id": 1854, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:12.495 --> 00:00:15.012\nMy work focuses on the

textile\n\n00:03:04.681 --> 00:03:06.562\nlike a shell made of concrete\n\n00:03:06.562 --> 00:03:10.133\nwith perforations that would let the air in,\n\n00:03:10.133 --> 00:03:12.757\nand also the light, but in a filtered way.\n\n00:03:12.757 --> 00:03:18.561\nAnd then the inspiration came from these beautiful \npatterns of the Ethiopian women's dresses.\n\n00:03:18.561 --> 00:03:20.736\nThat they have fractal geometry properties\n\n00:03:20.736 --> 00:03:22.867\nand this helped me to shape the whole facade.\n\n00:03:22.867 --> 00:03:24.472\nAnd we are building that\n\n00:03:24.472 --> 00:03:26.613\nwith these small prefabricated pieces\n\n00:03:26.613 --> 00:03:30.051\nthat are the windows that let the air and the light\n\n00:03:30.051 --> 00:03:32.033\nin a controlled way inside the building.\n\n00:03:32.033 --> 00:03:34.415\nAnd this is complemented by these small colored glasses\n\n00:03:34.415 --> 00:03:37.018\nthat use the light from the inside of the building\n\n00:03:37.018 --> 00:03:39.904\nto light up the building at night.\n\n00:03:39.904 --> 00:03:44.026\nWith these ideas it was not easy first to convince the developers\n\n00:03:44.026 --> 00:03:45.182\nbecause they were like,\n\n00:03:45.182 --> 00:03:47.870\n\"This is not a shopping mall. We didn't ask for that.\"\n\n00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:53.679\nBut then we all realized that this idea of the market\n\n00:03:53.679 --> 00:03:56.453\nhappened to be a lot more profitable than the idea of the shopping mall\n\n00:03:56.453 --> 00:03:59.173\nbecause basically they had more shops to sell.\n\n00:03:59.173 --> 00:04:03.247\nAnd also that the idea of the facade was much, much cheaper,\n\n00:04:03.247 --> 00:04:05.475\nnot only because of the material compared with the glass,\n\n00:04:05.475 --> 00:04:08.163\nbut also because we didn't need to have air conditioning anymore.\n\n00:04:08.163 --> 00:04:10.320\nSo we created some budget savings\n\n00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:12.217\nthat we used to implement the project.\n\n00:04:12.217 --> 00:04:14.149\nAnd the first implementation was to think\n\n00:04:14.149 --> 00:04:17.389\nabout how we could make the building self-sufficient in terms of energy\n\n00:04:17.389 --> 00:04:20.723\nin a city that has electricity cuts almost every day.\n\n00:04:20.723 --> 00:04:24.940\nSo we created a huge asset by placing photovoltaics there on the roof.\n\n00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:27.021\nAnd then under those panels\n\n00:04:27.021 --> 00:04:30.757\nwe thought about the roof like a new public space with gathering areas and bars\n\n00:04:30.757 --> 00:04:33.571\nthat would create this urban oasis.\n\n00:04:33.571 --> 00:04:35.361\nAnd these porches on the roof,\n\n00:04:35.361 --> 00:04:40.097\nall together they collect the water to reuse for sanitation on the inside.\n\n00:04:40.097 --> 00:04:45.259\nHopefully by the beginning of next year, because we are already on the fifth floor of the construction.\n\n00:04:45.259 --> 00:04:48.314\nThe second example is a master plan\n\n00:04:48.314 --> 00:04:51.593\nof 2,000 apartments and facilities in the city of Tunis.\n\n00:04:51.593 --> 00:04:55.527\nAnd for doing such a big project, the biggest project I've ever designed,\n\n00:04:55.527 --> 00:04:57.792\nI really needed to understand the city of Tunis,\n\n00:04:57.792 --> 00:05:01.914\nbut also its surroundings and the tradition and culture.\n\n00:05:01.914 --> 00:05:05.022\nDuring that analysis I paid special attention to the medina\n\n00:05:05.022 --> 00:05:08.999\nthat is this 1,000-year-old structure that used to be closed by a wall,\n\n00:05:08.999 --> 00:05:13.448\nopened by twelve different gates, connected by almost straight lines.\n\n00:05:13.448 --> 00:05:17.817\nWhen I went to the site, the first design operation we did\n\n00:05:17.817 --> 00:05:21.837\nwas to extend the existing streets, creating 12 initial blocks\n\n00:05:21.837 --> 00:05:25.021\nsimilar in size and characteristics to the ones we have in Barcelona\n\n00:05:25.021 --> 00:05:28.012\nand other cities in Europe with these courtyards.\n\n00:05:28.012 --> 00:05:30.797\nOn top of that, we selected some strategic points\n\n00:05:30.797 --> 00:05:33.998\nreminded of this idea of the gates and connecting them by straight lines,\n\n00:05:33.998 --> 00:05:36.768\nand this modified this initial pattern.\n\n00:05:36.768 --> 00:05:39.218\nAnd the last operation was to think about the cell,\n\n00:05:39.218 --> 00:05:41.908\nthe small cell of the project, like the apartment,\n\n00:05:41.908 --> 00:05:43.686\nas an essential part of the master plan.\n\n00:05:43.686 --> 00:05:46.859\nAnd for that I thought, what would be the best orientation\n\n00:05:46.859 --> 00:05:49.158\nin the Mediterranean climate for an apartment?\n\n00:05:49.158 --> 00:05:53.921\nAnd it's north-south, because it creates a thermal difference between both sides of the house\n\n00:05:53.921 --> 00:05:56.784\nand then a natural ventilation.\n\n00:05:56.784 --> 00:06:00.370\nSo we overlap a pattern that makes sure that most of the apartments\n\n00:06:00.370 --> 00:06:02.510\nare perfectly oriented in that direction.\n\n00:06:02.510 --> 00:06:03.970\nAnd this is the result\n\n00:06:03.970 --> 00:06:07.735\nthat is almost like a combination of the European block and the Arab city.\n\n00:06:07.735 --> 00:06:09.333\nIt has these blocks with courtyards,\n\n00:06:09.333 --> 00:06:10.456\nand then on the ground floor\n\n00:06:10.456 --> 00:06:12.592\nyou have all these connections for the pedestrians.\n\n00:06:12.592 --> 00:06:15.699\nAnd also it responds to the local regulations that establish\n\n00:06:15.699 --> 00:06:19.362\na higher density on the upper levels and a lower density on the ground floor.\n\n00:06:19.362 --> 00:06:22.908\nAnd it also reinforces this idea of the gates.\n\n00:06:22.908 --> 00:06:24.800\nThe volume has this connecting shape\n\n00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:28.102\nthat shades itself with three different types of apartments\n\n00:06:28.102 --> 00:06:31.745\nand also lets the light go on the ground floor in a very dense neighborhood\n\n00:06:31.745 --> 00:06:34.645\nAnd in the courtyards there are the different facilities,\n\n00:06:34.645 --> 00:06:36.375\nsuch as a gym and a kindergarten\n\n00:06:36.375 --> 00:06:40.445\nand close by, a series of commercial [spaces] that bring activity to the ground floor.\n\n00:06:40.445 --> 00:06:43.245\nThe roof, which is my favorite space of the project\n\n00:06:43.245 --> 00:06:46.955\nis almost like giving back to the community the space taken by the construction.\n\n00:06:46.955 --> 00:06:49.239\nAnd it's where all the neighbors, they can go up and socialize,\n\n00:06:49.239 --> 00:06:52.776\nand do activities such as having a two-kilometer run in the morning,\n\n00:06:52.776 --> 00:06:56.160\njumping from one building to another.\n\n00:06:56.160 --> 00:06:58.519\nThese two examples,\n\n00:06:58.519 --> 00:07:01.903\nthey have a common approach in the design process.\n\n00:07:01.903 --> 00:07:04.482\nAnd also, they are in emerging countries where you can see\n\n00:07:04.482 --> 00:07:06.628\nthe cities literally growing.\n\n00:07:06.628 --> 00:07:11.369\nIn these cities, the impact of architecture in people's lives of today and tomorrow\n\n00:07:11.369 --> 00:07:16.510\nchanges the local communities and economies at the same speed as the buildings grow.\n\n00:07:16.510 --> 00:07:19.118\nFor this reason, I see even more importance\n\n00:07:19.118 --> 00:07:24.148\nto look at architecture finding simple but affordable solutions\n\n00:07:24.148 --> 00:07:28.209\nthat enhance the relationship between the community and the environment\n\n00:07:28.209 --> 00:07:32.127\nand that aim to connect nature and people.\n\n00:07:32.127 --> 00:07:34.025\nThank you very much.\n\n00:07:34.025 --> 00:07:35.852\n(Applause)"}, {"title": "Government -- investor, risk-taker, innovator", "duration": "844", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/mariana_mazzucato_government_investor_risk_taker_innovator", "transcript": "Have you ever asked yourselves why it is that companies, the really cool companies, the innovative ones, the creative, new economy-type companies \u2014 Apple, Google, Facebook \u2014 are coming out of one particular country, the United States of America? Usually when I say this, someone says, \"Spotify! That's Europe.\" But, yeah. It has not had the impact that these other companies have had.Now what I do is I'm an economist, and I actually study the relationship between innovation and economic growth at the level of the company, the industry and the nation, and I work with policymakers worldwide, especially in the European Commission, but recently also in interesting places like China, and I can tell you that that question is on the tip of all of their tongues: Where are the European Googles? What is the secret behind the Silicon Valley growth model, which they understand is different from this old economy growth model? And what is interesting is that often, even if we're in the 21st century, we kind of come down in the end to these ideas of market versus state. It's talked about in these modern ways, but the idea is that somehow, behind places like Silicon Valley, the secret have been different types of market-making mechanisms, the private initiative, whether this be about a dynamic venture capital sector that's actually able to provide that high-risk finance to these innovative companies, the gazelles as we often call them, which traditional banks are scared of, or different types of really successful commercialization policies which actually allow these companies to bring these great inventions, their products, to the market and actually get over this really scary Death Valley period in which many companies instead fail.But what really interests me, especially nowadays and because of what's happening politically around the world, is the language that's used, the narrative, the discourse, the images, the actual words. So we often are presented with the kind of words like that the private sector is also much more innovative because it's able to think out of the box. They are more dynamic. Think of Steve Jobs' really inspirational speech to the 2005 graduating class at Stanford, where he said to be innovative, you've got to stay hungry, stay foolish. Right? So these guys are kind of the hungry and foolish and colorful guys, right? And in places like Europe, it might be more equitable, we might even be a bit better dressed and eat better than the U.S., but the problem is this damn public sector. It's a bit too big, and it hasn't actually allowed these things like dynamic venture capital and commercialization to actually be able to really be as fruitful as it could. And even really respectable newspapers, some that I'm actually subscribed to, the words they use are, you know, the state as this Leviathan. Right? This monster with big tentacles. They're very explicit in these editorials. They say, \"You know, the state, it's necessary to fix these little market failures when you have public goods or different types of negative externalities like pollution, but you know what, what is the next big revolution going to be after the Internet? We all hope it might be something green, or all of this nanotech stuff, and in order for that stuff to happen,\" they say \u2014 this was a special issue on the next industrial revolution \u2014 they say, \"the state, just stick to the basics, right? Fund the infrastructure. Fund the schools. Even fund the basic research, because this is popularly recognized, in fact, as a big public good which private companies don't want to invest in, do that, but you know what? Leave the rest to the revolutionaries.\" Those colorful, out-of-the-box kind of thinkers. They're often called garage tinkerers, because some of them actually did some things in garages, even though that's partly a myth. And so what I want to do with you in, oh God, only 10 minutes, is to really think again this juxtaposition, because it actually has massive, massive implications beyond innovation policy, which just happens to be the area that I often talk with with policymakers. It has huge implications, even with this whole notion that we have on where, when and why we should actually be cutting back on public spending and different types of public services which, of course, as we know, are increasingly being outsourced because of this juxtaposition. Right? I mean, the reason that we need to maybe have free schools or charter schools is in order to make them more innovative without being emburdened by this heavy hand of the state curriculum, or something. So these kind of words are constantly, these juxtapositions come up everywhere, not just with innovation policy.And so to think again, there's no reason that you should believe me, so just think of some of the smartest revolutionary things that you have in your pockets and do not turn it on, but you might want to take it out, your iPhone. Ask who actually funded the really cool, revolutionary thinking-out-of-the-box things in the iPhone. What actually makes your phone a smartphone, basically, instead of a stupid phone? So the Internet, which you can surf the web anywhere you are in the world; GPS, where you can actually know where you are anywhere in the world; the touchscreen display, which makes it also a really easy-to-use phone for anybody. These are the very smart, revolutionary bits about the iPhone, and they're all government-funded. And the point is that the Internet was funded by DARPA, U.S. Department of Defense. GPS was funded by the military's Navstar program. Even Siri was actually funded by DARPA. The touchscreen display was funded by two public grants by the CIA and the NSF to two public university researchers at the University of Delaware. Now, you might be thinking, \"Well, she's just said the word 'defense' and 'military' an awful lot,\" but what's really interesting is that this is actually true in sector after sector and department after department. So the pharmaceutical industry, which I am personally very interested in because I've actually had the fortune to study it in quite some depth, is wonderful to be asking this question about the revolutionary versus non-revolutionary bits, because each and every medicine can actually be divided up on whether it really is revolutionary or incremental. So the new molecular entities with priority rating are the revolutionary new drugs, whereas the slight variations of existing drugs \u2014 Viagra, different color, different dosage \u2014 are the less revolutionary ones. And it turns out that a full 75 percent of the new molecular entities with priority rating are actually funded in boring, Kafka-ian public sector labs. This doesn't mean that Big Pharma is not spending on innovation. They do. They spend on the marketing part. They spend on the D part of R&D. They spend an awful lot on buying back their stock, which is quite problematic. In fact, companies like Pfizer and Amgen recently have spent more money in buying back their shares to boost their stock price than on R&D, but that's a whole different TED Talk which one day I'd be fascinated to tell you about.Now, what's interesting in all of this is the state, in all these examples, was doing so much more than just fixing market failures. It was actually shaping and creating markets. It was funding not only the basic research, which again is a typical public good, but even the applied research. It was even, God forbid, being a venture capitalist. So these SBIR and SDTR programs, which give small companies early-stage finance have not only been extremely important compared to private venture capital, but also have become increasingly important. Why? Because, as many of us know, V.C. is actually quite short-term. They want their returns in three to five years. Innovation takes a much longer time than that, 15 to 20 years. And so this whole notion \u2014 I mean, this is the point, right? Who's actually funding the hard stuff? Of course, it's not just the state. The private sector does a lot. But the narrative that we've always been told is the state is important for the basics, but not really providing that sort of high-risk, revolutionary thinking out of the box. In all these sectors, from funding the Internet to doing the spending, but also the envisioning, the strategic vision, for these investments, it was actually coming within the state. The nanotechnology sector is actually fascinating to study this, because the word itself, nanotechnology, came from within government.And so there's huge implications of this. First of all, of course I'm not someone, this old-fashioned person, market versus state. What we all know in dynamic capitalism is that what we actually need are public-private partnerships. But the point is, by constantly depicting the state part as necessary but actually \u2014 pffff \u2014 a bit boring and often a bit dangerous kind of Leviathan, I think we've actually really stunted the possibility to build these public-private partnerships in a really dynamic way. Even the words that we often use to justify the \"P\" part, the public part \u2014 well, they're both P's \u2014 with public-private partnerships is in terms of de-risking. What the public sector did in all these examples I just gave you, and there's many more, which myself and other colleagues have been looking at, is doing much more than de-risking. It's kind of been taking on that risk. Bring it on. It's actually been the one thinking out of the box. But also, I'm sure you all have had experience with local, regional, national governments, and you're kind of like, \"You know what, that Kafka-ian bureaucrat, I've met him.\" That whole juxtaposition thing, it's kind of there. Well, there's a self-fulfilling prophecy. By talking about the state as kind of irrelevant, boring, it's sometimes that we actually create those organizations in that way. So what we have to actually do is build these entrepreneurial state organizations. DARPA, that funded the Internet and Siri, actually thought really hard about this, how to welcome failure, because you will fail. You will fail when you innovative. One out of 10 experiments has any success. And the V.C. guys know this, and they're able to actually fund the other losses from that one success.And this brings me, actually, probably, to the biggest implication, and this has huge implications beyond innovation. If the state is more than just a market fixer, if it actually is a market shaper, and in doing that has had to take on this massive risk, what happened to the reward? We all know, if you've ever taken a finance course, the first thing you're taught is sort of the risk-reward relationship, and so some people are foolish enough or probably smart enough if they have time to wait, to actually invest in stocks, because they're higher risk which over time will make a greater reward than bonds, that whole risk-reward thing. Well, where's the reward for the state of having taken on these massive risks and actually been foolish enough to have done the Internet? The Internet was crazy. It really was. I mean, the probability of failure was massive. You had to be completely nuts to do it, and luckily, they were. Now, we don't even get to this question about rewards unless you actually depict the state as this risk-taker. And the problem is that economists often think, well, there is a reward back to the state. It's tax. You know, the companies will pay tax, the jobs they create will create growth so people who get those jobs and their incomes rise will come back to the state through the tax mechanism. Well, unfortunately, that's not true. Okay, it's not true because many of the jobs that are created go abroad. Globalization, and that's fine. We shouldn't be nationalistic. Let the jobs go where they have to go, perhaps. I mean, one can take a position on that. But also these companies that have actually had this massive benefit from the state \u2014 Apple's a great example. They even got the first \u2014 well, not the first, but 500,000 dollars actually went to Apple, the company, through this SBIC program, which predated the SBIR program, as well as, as I said before, all the technologies behind the iPhone. And yet we know they legally, as many other companies, pay very little tax back.So what we really need to actually rethink is should there perhaps be a return-generating mechanism that's much more direct than tax. Why not? It could happen perhaps through equity. This, by the way, in the countries that are actually thinking about this strategically, countries like Finland in Scandinavia, but also in China and Brazil, they're retaining equity in these investments. Sitra funded Nokia, kept equity, made a lot of money, it's a public funding agency in Finland, which then funded the next round of Nokias. The Brazilian Development Bank, which is providing huge amounts of funds today to clean technology, they just announced a $56 billion program for the future on this, is retaining equity in these investments. So to put it provocatively, had the U.S. government thought about this, and maybe just brought back just something called an innovation fund, you can bet that, you know, if even just .05 percent of the profits from what the Internet produced had come back to that innovation fund, there would be so much more money to spend today on green technology. Instead, many of the state budgets which in theory are trying to do that are being constrained. But perhaps even more important, we heard before about the one percent, the 99 percent. If the state is thought about in this more strategic way, as one of the lead players in the value creation mechanism, because that's what we're talking about, right? Who are the different players in creating value in the economy, and is the state's role, has it been sort of dismissed as being a backseat player? If we can actually have a broader theory of value creation and allow us to actually admit what the state has been doing and reap something back, it might just be that in the next round, and I hope that we all hope that the next big revolution will in fact be green, that that period of growth will not only be smart, innovation-led, not only green, but also more inclusive, so that the public schools in places like Silicon Valley can actually also benefit from that growth, because they have not.Thank you.(Applause)", "id": 1855, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:12.029 --> 00:00:15.075\nHave you ever asked yourselves why it is that\n\n00:00:15.075 --> 00:00:17.155\ncompanies, the really cool companies,\n\n00:00:17.155 --> 00:00:18.667\nthe innovative ones, the creative,\n\n00:00:18.667 --> 00:00:20.469\nnew economy-type companies --\n\n00:00:20.469 --> 00:00:23.843\nApple, Google, Facebook --\n\n00:00:23.843 --> 00:00:26.531\nare coming out of one particular country,\n\n00:00:26.531 --> 00:00:28.262\nthe United States of America?\n\n00:00:28.262 --> 00:00:30.220\nUsually when I say this, someone says, \"Spotify!\n\n00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:31.698\nThat's Europe.\" But, yeah.\n\n00:00:31.698 --> 00:00:35.382\nIt has not had the impact that these other companies have had.\n\n00:00:35.382 --> 00:00:37.350\nNow what I do is I'm an economist,\n\n00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:38.838\nand I actually study the relationship\n\n00:00:38.838 --> 00:00:40.883\nbetween innovation and economic growth\n\n00:00:40.883 --> 00:00:43.782\nat the level of the company, the industry and the nation,\n\n00:00:43.782 --> 00:00:45.897\nand I work with policymakers worldwide,\n\n00:00:45.897 --> 00:00:47.368\nespecially in the European Commission,\n\n00:00:47.368 --> 00:00:50.679\nbut recently also in interesting places like China,\n\n00:00:50.679 --> 00:00:52.554\nand I can tell you that that question\n\n00:00:52.554 --> 00:00:55.154\nis on the tip of all of their tongues:\n\n00:00:55.154 --> 00:00:57.373\nWhere are the European Googles?\n\n00:00:57.373 --> 00:01:01.118\nWhat is the secret behind the Silicon Valley growth model,\n\n00:01:01.118 --> 00:01:03.126\nwhich they understand is different\n\n00:01:03.126 --> 00:01:06.007\nfrom this old economy growth model?\n\n00:01:06.007 --> 00:01:08.686\nAnd what is interesting is that often,\n\n00:01:08.686 --> 00:01:10.265\neven if we're in the 21st century,\n\n00:01:10.265 --> 00:01:12.648\nwe kind of come down in the end to these ideas\n\n00:01:12.648 --> 00:01:14.621\nof market versus state.\n\n00:01:14.621 --> 00:01:16.673\nIt's talked about in these modern ways,\n\n00:01:16.673 --> 00:01:20.436\nbut the idea is that somehow, behind places like Silicon Valley,\n\n00:01:20.436 --> 00:01:24.222\nthe secret have been different types of market-making mechanisms,\n\n00:01:24.222 --> 00:01:27.494\nthe private initiative, whether this be about\n\n00:01:27.494 --> 00:01:29.708\na dynamic venture capital sector\n\n00:01:29.708 --> 00:01:32.054\nthat's actually able to provide that high-risk finance\n\n00:01:32.054 --> 00:01:33.727\nto these innovative companies,\n\n00:01:33.727 --> 00:01:35.852\nthe gazelles as we often call them,\n\n00:01:35.852 --> 00:01:37.847\nwhich traditional banks are scared of,\n\n00:01:37.847 --> 00:01:39.879\nor different types of really successful\n\n00:01:39.879 --> 00:01:42.885\ncommercialization policies which actually allow these companies\n\n00:01:42.885 --> 00:01:45.140\nto bring these great inventions, their products,\n\n00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:47.163\nto the market and actually get over this\n\n00:01:47.163 --> 00:01:49.414\nreally scary Death Valley period\n\n00:01:49.414 --> 00:01:51.980\nin which many companies instead fail.\n\n00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:54.756\nBut what really interests me, especially nowadays\n\n00:01:54.756 --> 00:01:57.717\nand because of what's happening politically around the world,\n\n00:01:57.717 --> 00:02:00.970\nis the language that's used, the narrative,\n\n00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:04.129\nthe discourse, the images, the actual words.\n\n00:02:04.129 --> 00:02:06.434\nSo we often are presented\n\n00:02:06.434 --> 00:02:09.407\nwith the kind of words like that the private sector\n\n00:02:09.407 --> 00:02:11.677\nis also much more innovative because it's able to\n\n00:02:11.677 --> 00:02:13.277\nthink out of the box.\n\n00:02:13.277 --> 00:02:15.530\nThey are more dynamic.\n\n00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:18.284\nThink of Steve Jobs' really inspirational speech\n\n00:02:18.284 --> 00:02:21.422\nto the 2005 graduating class at Stanford,\n\n00:02:21.422 --> 00:02:23.514\nwhere he said to be innovative,\n\n00:02:23.514 --> 00:02:26.284\nyou've got to stay hungry, stay foolish.\n\n00:02:26.284 --> 00:02:27.819\nRight?

Because, as many of us know,\n\n00:07:38.827 --> 00:07:40.694\nV.C. is actually quite short-term.\n\n00:07:40.694 --> 00:07:42.483\nThey want their returns in three to five years.\n\n00:07:42.483 --> 00:07:45.012\nInnovation takes a much longer time than that,\n\n00:07:45.012 --> 00:07:46.839\n15 to 20 years.\n\n00:07:46.839 --> 00:07:49.226\nAnd so this whole notion -- I mean, this is the point, right?\n\n00:07:49.226 --> 00:07:51.553\nWho's actually funding the hard stuff?\n\n00:07:51.553 --> 00:07:53.278\nOf course, it's not just the state.\n\n00:07:53.278 --> 00:07:54.508\nThe private sector does a lot.\n\n00:07:54.508 --> 00:07:56.707\nBut the narrative that we've always been told\n\n00:07:56.707 --> 00:07:59.590\nis the state is important for the basics,\n\n00:07:59.590 --> 00:08:01.870\nbut not really providing that sort of high-risk,\n\n00:08:01.870 --> 00:08:04.170\nrevolutionary thinking out of the box.\n\n00:08:04.170 --> 00:08:06.502\nIn all these sectors, from funding the Internet\n\n00:08:06.502 --> 00:08:09.407\nto doing the spending, but also the envisioning,\n\n00:08:09.407 --> 00:08:11.698\nthe strategic vision, for these investments,\n\n00:08:11.698 --> 00:08:13.286\nit was actually coming within the state.\n\n00:08:13.286 --> 00:08:15.655\nThe nanotechnology sector is actually fascinating\n\n00:08:15.655 --> 00:08:18.753\nto study this, because the word itself, nanotechnology,\n\n00:08:18.753 --> 00:08:20.724\ncame from within government.\n\n00:08:20.724 --> 00:08:23.071\nAnd so there's huge implications of this.\n\n00:08:23.071 --> 00:08:25.176\nFirst of all, of course I'm not someone,\n\n00:08:25.176 --> 00:08:27.178\nthis old-fashioned person, market versus state.\n\n00:08:27.178 --> 00:08:29.703\nWhat we all know in dynamic capitalism\n\n00:08:29.703 --> 00:08:32.762\nis that what we actually need are public-private partnerships.\n\n00:08:32.762 --> 00:08:35.501\nBut the point is, by constantly depicting\n\n00:08:35.501 --> 00:08:37.626\nthe state part as necessary\n\n00:08:37.626 --> 00:08:40.507\nbut actually -- pffff -- a bit boring\n\n00:08:40.507 --> 00:08:43.556\nand often a bit dangerous kind of Leviathan,\n\n00:08:43.556 --> 00:08:46.308\nI think we've actually really stunted the possibility\n\n00:08:46.308 --> 00:08:47.880\nto build these public-private partnerships\n\n00:08:47.880 --> 00:08:49.426\nin a really dynamic way.\n\n00:08:49.426 --> 00:08:52.620\nEven the words that we often use to justify the \"P\" part,\n\n00:08:52.620 --> 00:08:54.848\nthe public part -- well, they're both P's --\n\n00:08:54.848 --> 00:08:56.208\nwith public-private partnerships\n\n00:08:56.208 --> 00:08:58.263\nis in terms of de-risking.\n\n00:08:58.263 --> 00:09:00.724\nWhat the public sector did in all these examples\n\n00:09:00.724 --> 00:09:02.811\nI just gave you, and there's many more,\n\n00:09:02.811 --> 00:09:06.275\nwhich myself and other colleagues have been looking at,\n\n00:09:06.275 --> 00:09:07.825\nis doing much more than de-risking.\n\n00:09:07.825 --> 00:09:10.391\nIt's kind of been taking on that risk. Bring it on.\n\n00:09:10.391 --> 00:09:12.964\nIt's actually been the one thinking out of the box.\n\n00:09:12.964 --> 00:09:15.675\nBut also, I'm sure you all have had experience\n\n00:09:15.675 --> 00:09:17.735\nwith local, regional, national governments,\n\n00:09:17.735 --> 00:09:20.882\nand you're kind of like, \"You know what, that Kafka-ian bureaucrat, I've met him.\"\n\n00:09:20.882 --> 00:09:24.326\nThat whole juxtaposition thing, it's kind of there.\n\n00:09:24.326 --> 00:09:26.140\nWell, there's a self-fulfilling prophecy.\n\n00:09:26.140 --> 00:09:28.306\nBy talking about the state as kind of irrelevant,\n\n00:09:28.306 --> 00:09:30.633\nboring, it's sometimes\n\n00:09:30.633 --> 00:09:32.845\nthat we actually create those organizations in that way.\n\n00:09:32.845 --> 00:09:35.046\nSo what we have to actually do is build\n\n00:09:35.046 --> 00:09:37.222\nthese entrepreneurial state organizations.\n\n00:09:37.222 --> 00:09:39.711\nDARPA, that funded the Internet and Siri,\n\n00:09:39.711 --> 00:09:41.296\nactually thought really hard about this,\n\n00:09:41.296 --> 00:09:43.989\nhow to welcome failure, because you will fail.\n\n00:09:43.989 --> 00:09:45.914\nYou will fail when you innovative.\n\n00:09:45.914 --> 00:09:49.786\nOne out of 10 experiments has any success.\n\n00:09:49.786 --> 00:09:51.524\nAnd the V.C. guys know this,\n\n00:09:51.524 --> 00:09:53.396\nand they're able to actually fund the other losses\n\n00:09:53.396 --> 00:09:55.250\nfrom that one success.\n\n00:09:55.250 --> 00:09:56.743\nAnd this brings me, actually, probably,\n\n00:09:56.743 --> 00:09:59.338\nto the biggest implication,\n\n00:09:59.338 --> 00:10:02.005\nand this has huge implications beyond innovation.\n\n00:10:02.005 --> 00:10:05.665\nIf the state is more than just a market fixer,\n\n00:10:05.665 --> 00:10:07.477\nif it actually is a market shaper,\n\n00:10:07.477 --> 00:10:10.445\nand in doing that has had to take on this massive risk,\n\n00:10:10.445 --> 00:10:12.439\nwhat happened to the reward?\n\n00:10:12.439 --> 00:10:14.813\nWe all know, if you've ever taken a finance course,\n\n00:10:14.813 --> 00:10:18.219\nthe first thing you're taught is sort of the risk-reward relationship,\n\n00:10:18.219 --> 00:10:19.839\nand so some people are foolish enough\n\n00:10:19.839 --> 00:10:22.301\nor probably smart enough if they have time to wait,\n\n00:10:22.301 --> 00:10:24.783\nto actually invest in stocks, because they're higher risk\n\n00:10:24.783 --> 00:10:27.303\nwhich over time will make a greater reward than bonds,\n\n00:10:27.303 --> 00:10:28.882\nthat whole risk-reward thing.\n\n00:10:28.882 --> 00:10:30.855\nWell, where's the reward for the state\n\n00:10:30.855 --> 00:10:33.311\nof having taken on these massive risks\n\n00:10:33.311 --> 00:10:35.770\nand actually been foolish enough to have done the Internet?\n\n00:10:35.770 --> 00:10:37.722\nThe Internet was crazy.\n\n00:10:37.722 --> 00:10:40.874\nIt really was.

It's tax.\n\n00:10:57.001 --> 00:10:58.550\nYou know, the companies will pay tax,\n\n00:10:58.550 --> 00:11:00.840\nthe jobs they create will create growth\n\n00:11:00.840 --> 00:11:03.991\nso people who get those jobs and their incomes rise\n\n00:11:03.991 --> 00:11:07.215\nwill come back to the state through the tax mechanism.\n\n00:11:07.215 --> 00:11:09.205\nWell, unfortunately, that's not true.\n\n00:11:09.205 --> 00:11:12.724\nOkay, it's not true because many of the jobs that are created go abroad.\n\n00:11:12.724 --> 00:11:15.691\nGlobalization, and that's fine. We shouldn't be nationalistic.\n\n00:11:15.691 --> 00:11:17.898\nLet the jobs go where they have to go, perhaps.\n\n00:11:17.898 --> 00:11:19.987\nI mean, one can take a position on that.\n\n00:11:19.987 --> 00:11:21.651\nBut also these companies\n\n00:11:21.651 --> 00:11:24.723\nthat have actually had this massive benefit from the state --\n\n00:11:24.723 --> 00:11:26.584\nApple's a great example.\n\n00:11:26.584 --> 00:11:28.633\nThey even got the first -- well, not the first,\n\n00:11:28.633 --> 00:11:33.201\nbut 500,000 dollars actually went to Apple, the company,\n\n00:11:33.201 --> 00:11:35.870\nthrough this SBIC program,\n\n00:11:35.870 --> 00:11:37.918\nwhich predated the SBIR program,\n\n00:11:37.918 --> 00:11:41.236\nas well as, as I said before, all the technologies behind the iPhone.\n\n00:11:41.236 --> 00:11:43.726\nAnd yet we know they legally,\n\n00:11:43.726 --> 00:11:47.408\nas many other companies, pay very little tax back.\n\n00:11:47.408 --> 00:11:50.395\nSo what we really need to actually rethink\n\n00:11:50.395 --> 00:11:54.654\nis should there perhaps be a return-generating mechanism\n\n00:11:54.654 --> 00:11:57.341\nthat's much more direct than tax. Why not?\n\n00:11:57.341 --> 00:11:59.911\nIt could happen perhaps through equity.\n\n00:11:59.911 --> 00:12:01.718\nThis, by the way, in the countries\n\n00:12:01.718 --> 00:12:04.022\nthat are actually thinking about this strategically,\n\n00:12:04.022 --> 00:12:06.153\ncountries like Finland in Scandinavia,\n\n00:12:06.153 --> 00:12:08.188\nbut also in China and Brazil,\n\n00:12:08.188 --> 00:12:10.518\nthey're retaining equity in these investments.\n\n00:12:10.518 --> 00:12:14.344\nSitra funded Nokia, kept equity, made a lot of money,\n\n00:12:14.344 --> 00:12:17.004\nit's a public funding agency in Finland,\n\n00:12:17.004 --> 00:12:19.830\nwhich then funded the next round of Nokias.\n\n00:12:19.830 --> 00:12:21.839\nThe Brazilian Development Bank,\n\n00:12:21.839 --> 00:12:24.634\nwhich is providing huge amounts of funds today\n\n00:12:24.634 --> 00:12:26.431\nto clean technology, they just announced\n\n00:12:26.431 --> 00:12:30.680\na $56 billion program for the future on this,\n\n00:12:30.680 --> 00:12:34.219\nis retaining equity in these investments.\n\n00:12:34.219 --> 00:12:35.731\nSo to put it provocatively,\n\n00:12:35.731 --> 00:12:38.670\nhad the U.S. government thought about this,\n\n00:12:38.670 --> 00:12:40.514\nand maybe just brought back\n\n00:12:40.514 --> 00:12:42.939\njust something called an innovation fund,\n\n00:12:42.939 --> 00:12:46.071\nyou can bet that, you know, if even just .05 percent\n\n00:12:46.071 --> 00:12:47.954\nof the profits from what the Internet produced\n\n00:12:47.954 --> 00:12:49.612\nhad come back to that innovation fund,\n\n00:12:49.612 --> 00:12:51.236\nthere would be so much more money\n\n00:12:51.236 --> 00:12:53.464\nto spend today on green technology.\n\n00:12:53.464 --> 00:12:54.958\nInstead, many of the state budgets\n\n00:12:54.958 --> 00:12:57.556\nwhich in theory are trying to do that\n\n00:12:57.556 --> 00:12:59.392\nare being constrained.\n\n00:12:59.392 --> 00:13:01.202\nBut perhaps even more important,\n\n00:13:01.202 --> 00:13:03.069\nwe heard before about the one percent,\n\n00:13:03.069 --> 00:13:04.644\nthe 99 percent.\n\n00:13:04.644 --> 00:13:08.389\nIf the state is thought about in this more strategic way,\n\n00:13:08.389 --> 00:13:11.422\nas one of the lead players in the value creation mechanism,\n\n00:13:11.422 --> 00:13:13.243\nbecause that's what we're talking about, right?\n\n00:13:13.243 --> 00:13:15.177\nWho are the different players in creating value\n\n00:13:15.177 --> 00:13:17.472\nin the economy, and is the state's role,\n\n00:13:17.472 --> 00:13:21.201\nhas it been sort of dismissed as being a backseat player?\n\n00:13:21.201 --> 00:13:23.556\nIf we can actually have a broader theory\n\n00:13:23.556 --> 00:13:25.609\nof value creation and allow us to actually admit\n\n00:13:25.609 --> 00:13:28.660\nwhat the state has been doing and reap something back,\n\n00:13:28.660 --> 00:13:31.479\nit might just be that in the next round,\n\n00:13:31.479 --> 00:13:34.045\nand I hope that we all hope that the next big revolution\n\n00:13:34.045 --> 00:13:35.686\nwill in fact be green,\n\n00:13:35.686 --> 00:13:37.409\nthat that period of growth\n\n00:13:37.409 --> 00:13:40.099\nwill not only be smart, innovation-led,\n\n00:13:40.099 --> 00:13:43.285\nnot only green, but also more inclusive,\n\n00:13:43.285 --> 00:13:46.539\nso that the public schools in places like Silicon Valley\n\n00:13:46.539 --> 00:13:49.279\ncan actually also benefit from that growth,\n\n00:13:49.279 --> 00:13:50.878\nbecause they have not.\n\n00:13:50.878 --> 00:13:52.131\nThank you.\n\n00:13:52.131 --> 00:13:57.378\n(Applause)"}, {"title": "A simple solution to the coming phosphorus crisis", "duration": "821", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/mohamed_hijri_a_simple_solution_to_the_coming_phosphorus_crisis", "transcript": "I'm going to start by asking you a question: Is anyone familiar with the blue algae problem? Okay, so most of you are. I think we can all agree it's a serious issue. Nobody wants to drink blue algae-contaminated water, or swim in a blue algae-infested lake. Right?I hope you won't be disappointed, but today, I won't be talking about blue algae. Instead, I'll be talking about the main cause at the root of this issue, which I will be referring to as the phosphorus crisis. Why have I chosen to talk to you about the phosphorus crisis today? For the simple reason that nobody else is talking about it. And by the end of my presentation, I hope that the general public will be more aware of this crisis and this issue.Now, the problem is that if I ask, why do we find ourselves in this situation with blue algae? The answer is that it comes from how we farm. We use fertilizers in our farming, chemical fertilizers. Why do we use chemical fertilizers in agriculture? Basically, to help plants grow and to produce a better yield. The issue is that this is set to engender an environmental problem that is without precedent.Before going further, let me give you a crash course in plant biology. So, what does a plant need in order to grow? A plant, quite simply, needs light, it needs CO2, but even more importantly, it needs nutrients, which it draws from the soil. Several of these nutrients are essential chemical elements: phosphorus, nitrogen and calcium. So, the plant\u2019s roots will extract these resources.Today I'll be focusing on a major problem that is linked to phosphorus. Why phosphorus in particular? Because it is the most problematic chemical element. By the end of my presentation, you will have seen what these problems are, and where we are today.Phosphorus is a chemical element that is essential to life. This is a very important point. I\u2019d like everyone to understand precisely what the phosphorus issue is. Phosphorus is a key component in several molecules, in many of our molecules of life. Experts in the field will know that cellular communication is phosphorus-based \u2014 phosphorylation, dephosphorylation. Cell membranes are phosphorus-based: These are called phospholipids. The energy in all living things, ATP, is phosphorus-based. And more importantly still, phosphorus is a key component of DNA, something everyone is familiar with, and which is shown in this image. DNA is our genetic heritage. It is extremely important, and once again, phosphorus is a key player.Now, where do we find this phosphorus? As humans, where do we find it? As I explained earlier, plants extract phosphorus from the soil, through water. So, we humans get it from the things we eat: plants, vegetables, fruits, and also from eggs, meat and milk. It\u2019s true that some humans eat better than others. Some are happier than others. And now, looking at this picture, which speaks for itself, we see modern agriculture, which I also refer to as intensive agriculture. Intensive agriculture is based on the use of chemical fertilizers. Without them, we would not manage to produce enough to feed the world's population. Speaking of humans, there are currently 7 billion of us on Earth. In less than 40 years, there will be 9 billion of us. And the question is a simple one: Do we have enough phosphorus to feed our future generations?So, in order to understand these issues, where do we find our phosphorus? Let me explain. But first, let\u2019s just suppose that we are using 100 percent of a given dose of phosphorus. Only 15 percent of this 100 percent goes to the plant. Eighty-five percent is lost. It goes into the soil, ending its journey in the lakes, resulting in lakes with extra phosphorus, which leads to the blue algae problem. So, you\u2019ll see there\u2019s a problem here, something that is illogical. A hundred percent of the phosphorus is used, but only 15 percent goes to the plant. You\u2019re going to tell me it\u2019s wasteful. Yes, it is. What is worse is that it is very expensive. Nobody wants to throw their money out the window, but unfortunately that's what is happening here. Eighty percent of each dose of phosphorus is lost. Modern agriculture depends on phosphorus. And because in order to get 15 percent of it to the plant, all the rest is lost, we have to add more and more.Now, where will we get this phosphorus from? Basically, we get it out of mines. This is the cover of an extraordinary article published in Nature in 2009, which really launched the discussion about the phosphorus crisis. Phosphorus, a nutrient essential to life, which is becoming increasingly scarce, yet nobody is talking about it. And everyone agrees: Politicians and scientists are in agreement that we are headed for a phosphorus crisis.What you are seeing here is an open-pit mine in the U.S., and to give you an idea of the dimensions of this mine, if you look in the top right-hand corner, the little crane you can see, that is a giant crane. So that really puts it into perspective. So, we get phosphorus from mines. And if I make a comparison with oil, there\u2019s an oil crisis, we talk about it, we talk about global warming, yet we never mention the phosphorus crisis. To come back to the oil problem, oil is something we can replace. We can use biofuels, or solar power, or hydropower, but phosphorus is an essential element, indispensable to life, and we can\u2019t replace it.What is the current state of the world's phosphorus reserves? This graph gives you a rough idea of where we are today. The black line represents predictions for phosphorus reserves. In 2030, we\u2019ll reach the peak. By the end of this century, it will all be gone. The dotted line shows where we are today. As you can see, they meet in 2030, I\u2019ll be retired by then. But we are indeed heading for a major crisis, and I\u2019d like people to become aware of this problem.Do we have a solution? What are we to do? We are faced with a paradox. Less and less phosphorus will be available. By 2050 there will be 9 billion of us, and according to the U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization, we will need to produce twice as much food in 2050 than we do today. So, we will have less phosphorus, but we'll need to produce more food. What should we do? It truly is a paradoxical situation. Do we have a solution, or an alternative which will allow us to optimize phosphorus use?Remember that 80 percent is destined to be lost. The solution I'm offering today is one that has existed for a very long time, even before plants existed on Earth, and it's a microscopic mushroom that is very mysterious, very simple, and yet also extremely complex. I've been fascinated by this little mushroom for over 16 years now. It has led me to further my research and to use it as a model for my laboratory research.This mushroom exists in symbiosis with the roots. By symbiosis, I mean a bidirectional and mutually beneficial association which is also called mycorrhiza. This slide illustrates the elements of a mycorrhiza. You\u2019re looking at the root of wheat, one of the world\u2019s most important plants. Normally, a root will find phosphorus all by itself. It will go in search of phosphorus, but only within the one millimeter which surrounds it. Beyond one millimeter, the root is ineffective. It cannot go further in its search for phosphorus. Now, imagine this tiny, microscopic mushroom. It grows much faster, and is much better designed to seek out phosphorus. It can go beyond the root\u2019s one-millimeter scope to seek out phosphorus.I haven\u2019t invented anything at all; it's a biotechnology that has existed for 450 million years. And over time, this mushroom has evolved and adapted to seek out even the tiniest trace of phosphorus, and to put it to use, to make it available to the plant. What you\u2019re seeing here, in the real world, is a carrot root, and the mushroom with its very fine filaments. Looking closer, we can see that this mushroom is very gentle in its penetration. It will proliferate between the root's cells, eventually penetrating a cell and starting to form a typical arbuscular structure, which will considerably increase the exchange interface between the plant and the mushroom. And it is through this structure that mutual exchanges will occur. It\u2019s a win-win trade: I give you phosphorus, and you feed me. True symbiosis.Now let's add a mycorrhiza plant into the diagram I used earlier. And instead of using a 100 percent dose, I\u2019m going to reduce it to 25 percent. You\u2019ll see that of this 25 percent, most will benefit the plant, more than 90 percent. A very small amount of phosphorus will remain in the soil. That's completely natural. What's more is that in certain cases, we don't even need to add phosphorus.If you recall the graphs I showed you earlier, 85 percent of phosphorus is lost in the soil, and the plants are unable to access it. Even though it is present in the soil, it is in insoluble form. The plant is only able to seek out soluble forms. The mushroom is capable of dissolving this insoluble form and making it available for the plant to use. To further support my argument, here is a picture that speaks for itself. These are trials in a field of sorghum. On the left side, you see the yield produced using conventional agriculture, with a 100 percent phosphorus dose. On the other side, the dose was reduced to 50 percent, and just look at the yield. With only a half-dose, we achieved a better yield.This is to show you that this method works. And in some cases, in Cuba, Mexico and India, the dose can be reduced to 25 percent, and in several other cases, there's no need to add any phosphorus at all, because the mushrooms are so well adapted to finding phosphorus and drawing it from the soil. This is an example of soy production in Canada. Mycorrhiza was used in one field but not in the other. And here, where blue indicates a better yield, and yellow a weaker yield. The black rectangle is the plot from which the mycorrhiza was added. In other words, as I already said, I have invented nothing. Mycorrhiza has existed for 450 million years, and it has even helped modern-day plant species to diversify.So, this it isn't something that is still undergoing lab tests. Mycorrhiza exists, it works, it's produced at an industrial scale and commercialized worldwide. The problem is that people are not aware of it. People like food producers and farmers are still not aware of this problem. We have a technology that works, and one that, if used correctly, will alleviate some of the pressure we are putting on the world's phosphorus reserves.In conclusion, I am a scientist and a dreamer. I'm passionate about this topic. So if you were to ask me what my retirement dream is, which will be at the moment we reach that phosphorus peak, it would be that we use one label, \"Made with mycorrhiza,\" and that my children and grandchildren buy products bearing that label too.Thank you for your attention.(Applause)", "id": 1783, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:13.148 -->

vegetables, fruits,\n\n00:03:35.355 --> 00:03:38.360\nand also from eggs, meat and milk.\n\n00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:41.927\nIt\u2019s true that some humans\neat better than others.\n\n00:03:41.927 --> 00:03:43.903\nSome are happier than others.\n\n00:03:44.563 --> 00:03:48.744\nAnd now, looking at this picture,\nwhich speaks for itself,\n\n00:03:49.034 --> 00:03:50.850\nwe see modern agriculture,\n\n00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:54.406\nwhich I also refer to\nas intensive agriculture.\n\n00:03:54.406 --> 00:03:58.862\nIntensive agriculture is based\non the use of chemical fertilizers.\n\n00:03:58.862 --> 00:04:01.890\nWithout them,\nwe would not manage to produce enough\n\n00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:04.918\nto feed the world's population.\n\n00:04:04.918 --> 00:04:08.396\nSpeaking of humans, there are currently\n7 billion of us on Earth.\n\n00:04:08.696 --> 00:04:11.822\nIn less than 40 years,\nthere will be 9 billion of us.\n\n00:04:11.822 --> 00:04:15.212\nAnd the question is a simple one:\nDo we have enough phosphorus\n\n00:04:15.212 --> 00:04:18.082\nto feed our future generations?\n\n00:04:19.092 --> 00:04:23.174\nSo, in order to understand these issues,\nwhere do we find our phosphorus?\n\n00:04:23.174 --> 00:04:24.795\nLet me explain.\n\n00:04:24.955 --> 00:04:27.532\nBut first, let\u2019s just suppose\n\n00:04:27.802 --> 00:04:32.708\nthat we are using\n100 percent of a given dose of phosphorus.\n\n00:04:33.648 --> 00:04:40.776\nOnly 15 percent of this 100 percent goes to the plant.\nEighty-five percent is lost.\n\n00:04:42.236 --> 00:04:45.635\nIt goes into the soil,\nending its journey in the lakes,\n\n00:04:45.905 --> 00:04:49.631\nresulting in lakes with extra phosphorus,\nwhich leads to the blue algae problem.\n\n00:04:49.631 --> 00:04:53.369\nSo, you\u2019ll see there\u2019s a problem here,\nsomething that is illogical.\n\n00:04:53.369 --> 00:04:57.458\nA hundred percent of the phosphorus is used,\nbut only 15 percent goes to the plant.\n\n00:04:57.808 --> 00:04:59.742\nYou\u2019re going to tell me it\u2019s wasteful.\n\n00:05:00.232 --> 00:05:04.359\nYes, it is. What is worse\nis that it is very expensive.\n\n00:05:04.359 --> 00:05:07.741\nNobody wants to throw their money\nout the window,\n\n00:05:07.741 --> 00:05:10.081\nbut unfortunately\nthat's what is happening here.\n\n00:05:10.471 --> 00:05:13.277\nEighty percent of each dose of phosphorus is lost.\n\n00:05:15.007 --> 00:05:20.659\nModern agriculture\ndepends on phosphorus.\n\n00:05:20.659 --> 00:05:25.258\nAnd because in order to get 15 percent of it\nto the plant, all the rest is lost,\n\n00:05:25.258 --> 00:05:27.179\nwe have to add more and more.\n\n00:05:27.179 --> 00:05:30.553\nNow, where will we get\nthis phosphorus from?\n\n00:05:31.093 --> 00:05:34.427\nBasically, we get it out of mines.\n\n00:05:34.947 --> 00:05:37.194\nThis is the cover\nof an extraordinary article\n\n00:05:37.474 --> 00:05:39.231\npublished in Nature in 2009,\n\n00:05:39.231 --> 00:05:42.418\nwhich really launched the discussion\nabout the phosphorus crisis.\n\n00:05:42.418 --> 00:05:47.381\nPhosphorus, a nutrient essential to life,\nwhich is becoming increasingly scarce,\n\n00:05:47.381 --> 00:05:49.204\nyet nobody is talking about it.\n\n00:05:49.204 --> 00:05:55.068\nAnd everyone agrees:\nPoliticians and scientists are in agreement\n\n00:05:55.068 --> 00:05:57.409\nthat we are headed\nfor a phosphorus crisis.\n\n00:05:57.409 --> 00:06:00.857\nWhat you are seeing here\nis an open-pit mine in the U.S.,\n\n00:06:00.857 --> 00:06:03.958\nand to give you an idea\nof the dimensions of this mine,\n\n00:06:03.958 --> 00:06:07.512\nif you look in the top right-hand corner,\nthe little crane you can see,\n\n00:06:07.512 --> 00:06:08.977\nthat is a giant crane.\n\n00:06:09.327 --> 00:06:12.361\nSo that really puts it into perspective.\n\n00:06:12.361 --> 00:06:14.559\nSo, we get phosphorus from mines.\n\n00:06:14.559 --> 00:06:17.007\nAnd if I make a comparison with oil,\n\n00:06:17.767 --> 00:06:21.138\nthere\u2019s an oil crisis, we talk about it,\nwe talk about global warming,\n\n00:06:21.138 --> 00:06:23.162\nyet we never mention\nthe phosphorus crisis.\n\n00:06:23.162 --> 00:06:26.994\nTo come back to the oil problem,\noil is something we can replace.\n\n00:06:27.364 --> 00:06:31.726\nWe can use biofuels, or solar power,\n\n00:06:31.726 --> 00:06:35.490\nor hydropower,\nbut phosphorus is an essential element,\n\n00:06:35.490 --> 00:06:39.214\nindispensable to life,\nand we can\u2019t replace it.\n\n00:06:41.064 --> 00:06:44.727\nWhat is the current state\nof the world's phosphorus reserves?\n\n00:06:44.727 --> 00:06:48.838\nThis graph gives you a rough idea\nof where we are today.\n\n00:06:48.838 --> 00:06:53.489\nThe black line represents predictions\nfor phosphorus reserves.\n\n00:06:53.489 --> 00:06:56.113\nIn 2030, we\u2019ll reach the peak.\n\n00:06:56.113 --> 00:06:59.439\nBy the end of this century,\nit will all be gone.\n\n00:06:59.619 --> 00:07:03.504\nThe dotted line shows where we are today.\n\n00:07:03.934 --> 00:07:07.406\nAs you can see, they meet in 2030,\nI\u2019ll be retired by then.\n\n00:07:08.616 --> 00:07:12.185\nBut we are indeed heading\nfor a major crisis,\n\n00:07:12.185 --> 00:07:15.457\nand I\u2019d like people to become aware\nof this problem.\n\n00:07:16.047 --> 00:07:17.687\nDo we have a solution?\n\n00:07:18.407 --> 00:07:21.519\nWhat are we to do?\nWe are faced with a paradox.\n\n00:07:22.489 --> 00:07:24.796\nLess and less phosphorus\nwill be available.\n\n00:07:25.076 --> 00:07:28.272\nBy 2050 there will be 9 billion of us,\n\n00:07:28.442 --> 00:07:34.806\nand according to\nthe U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization,\n\n00:07:35.056 --> 00:07:39.799\nwe will need to produce twice as much food\nin 2050 than we do today.\n\n00:07:39.799 --> 00:07:43.569\nSo, we will have less phosphorus,\nbut we'll need to produce more food.\n\n00:07:44.099 --> 00:07:45.717\nWhat should we do?\n\n00:07:46.157 --> 00:07:48.247\nIt truly is a paradoxical situation.\n\n00:07:48.987 --> 00:07:51.735\nDo we have a solution,\nor an alternative\n\n00:07:51.735 --> 00:07:54.703\nwhich will allow us to optimize\nphosphorus use?\n\n00:07:54.703 --> 00:07:58.073\nRemember that 80 percent is destined to be lost.\n\n00:08:00.323 --> 00:08:07.627\nThe solution I'm offering today is one\nthat has existed for a very long time,\n\n00:08:07.627 --> 00:08:10.025\neven before plants existed on Earth,\n\n00:08:10.365 --> 00:08:13.843\nand it's a microscopic mushroom\nthat is very mysterious,\n\n00:08:13.843 --> 00:08:17.351\nvery simple,\nand yet also extremely complex.\n\n00:08:17.891 --> 00:08:22.579\nI've been fascinated by this little mushroom\nfor over 16 years now.\n\n00:08:22.579 --> 00:08:26.424\nIt has led me to further my research\n\n00:08:26.424 --> 00:08:29.794\nand to use it as a model\nfor my laboratory research.\n\n00:08:29.794 --> 00:08:33.248\nThis mushroom exists in symbiosis\nwith the roots.\n\n00:08:33.508 --> 00:08:38.895\nBy symbiosis, I mean a bidirectional\nand mutually beneficial association\n\n00:08:38.895 --> 00:08:41.923\nwhich is also called mycorrhiza.\n\n00:08:44.043 --> 00:08:47.100\nThis slide illustrates the elements\nof a mycorrhiza.\n\n00:08:47.100 --> 00:08:49.365\nYou\u2019re looking at the root of wheat,\n\n00:08:49.365 --> 00:08:52.709\none of the world\u2019s most important plants.\n\n00:08:53.459 --> 00:08:56.298\nNormally, a root will find phosphorus\nall by itself.\n\n00:08:56.298 --> 00:08:58.330\nIt will go in search of phosphorus,\n\n00:08:58.330 --> 00:09:01.572\nbut only within the one millimeter\nwhich surrounds it.\n\n00:09:02.002 --> 00:09:05.077\nBeyond one millimeter,\nthe root is ineffective.\n\n00:09:05.077 --> 00:09:07.402\nIt cannot go further\nin its search for phosphorus.\n\n00:09:07.402 --> 00:09:10.138\nNow, imagine this tiny,\nmicroscopic mushroom.\n\n00:09:10.138 --> 00:09:12.399\nIt grows much faster,\n\n00:09:12.399 --> 00:09:15.195\nand is much better designed\nto seek out phosphorus.\n\n00:09:15.195 --> 00:09:18.574\nIt can go beyond\nthe root\u2019s one-millimeter scope\n\n00:09:18.574 --> 00:09:20.661\nto seek out phosphorus.\n\n00:09:20.661 --> 00:09:22.717\nI haven\u2019t invented anything at all;\n\n00:09:22.717 --> 00:09:26.215\nit's a biotechnology that has existed\nfor 450 million years.\n\n00:09:26.215 --> 00:09:30.128\nAnd over time, this mushroom\nhas evolved and adapted to seek out\n\n00:09:30.128 --> 00:09:33.621\neven the tiniest trace of phosphorus,\nand to put it to use,\n\n00:09:33.621 --> 00:09:35.954\nto make it available to the plant.\n\n00:09:36.674 --> 00:09:40.607\nWhat you\u2019re seeing here,\nin the real world, is a carrot root,\n\n00:09:41.247 --> 00:09:43.878\nand the mushroom\nwith its very fine filaments.\n\n00:09:43.878 --> 00:09:46.285\nLooking closer,\nwe can see that this mushroom\n\n00:09:46.285 --> 00:09:48.372\nis very gentle in its penetration.\n\n00:09:48.372 --> 00:09:52.061\nIt will proliferate\nbetween the root's cells,\n\n00:09:52.061 --> 00:09:55.144\neventually penetrating a cell\n\n00:09:55.554 --> 00:10:00.238\nand starting to form\na typical arbuscular structure,\n\n00:10:00.558 --> 00:10:05.435\nwhich will considerably increase\nthe exchange interface\n\n00:10:05.435 --> 00:10:07.994\nbetween the plant and the mushroom.\n\n00:10:07.994 --> 00:10:11.439\nAnd it is through this structure\nthat mutual exchanges will occur.\n\n00:10:11.439 --> 00:10:13.075\nIt\u2019s a win-win trade:\n\n00:10:13.075 --> 00:10:15.640\nI give you phosphorus, and you feed me.\n\n00:10:15.950 --> 00:10:18.220\nTrue symbiosis.\n\n00:10:20.560 --> 00:10:23.328\nNow let's add a mycorrhiza plant\n\n00:10:23.328 --> 00:10:26.588\ninto the diagram I used earlier.\n\n00:10:26.588 --> 00:10:31.665\nAnd instead of using a 100 percent dose,\nI\u2019m going to reduce it to 25 percent.\n\n00:10:31.665 --> 00:10:36.639\nYou\u2019ll see that of this 25 percent,\nmost will benefit the plant,\n\n00:10:36.639 --> 00:10:38.195\nmore than 90 percent.\n\n00:10:38.195 --> 00:10:41.775\nA very small amount of phosphorus\nwill remain in the soil.\n\n00:10:41.775 --> 00:10:44.075\nThat's completely natural.\n\n00:10:45.535 --> 00:10:49.406\nWhat's more is that in certain cases,\nwe don't even need to add phosphorus.\n\n00:10:49.406 --> 00:10:51.818\nIf you recall the graphs\nI showed you earlier,\n\n00:10:51.818 --> 00:10:55.039\n85 percent of phosphorus is lost in the soil,\n\n00:10:55.039 --> 00:10:58.284\nand the plants are unable to access it.\n\n00:10:58.284 --> 00:11:02.092\nEven though it is present in the soil,\nit is in insoluble form.\n\n00:11:02.092 --> 00:11:05.102\nThe plant is only able to seek out\nsoluble forms.\n\n00:11:05.102 --> 00:11:08.914\nThe mushroom is capable\nof dissolving this insoluble form\n\n00:11:08.914 --> 00:11:12.355\nand making it available\nfor the plant to use.\n\n00:11:12.355 --> 00:11:15.906\nTo further support my argument,\nhere is a picture that speaks for itself.\n\n00:11:15.906 --> 00:11:19.794\nThese are trials\nin a field of sorghum.\n\n00:11:19.794 --> 00:11:24.306\nOn the left side, you see the yield\nproduced using conventional agriculture,\n\n00:11:24.306 --> 00:11:26.888\nwith a 100 percent phosphorus dose.\n\n00:11:27.048 --> 00:11:30.261\nOn the other side,\nthe dose was reduced to 50 percent,\n\n00:11:30.261 --> 00:11:31.794\nand just look at the yield.\n\n00:11:31.794 --> 00:11:37.375\nWith only a half-dose,\nwe achieved a better yield.\n\n00:11:37.375 --> 00:11:42.205\nThis is to show you\nthat this method works.\n\n00:11:42.205 --> 00:11:46.774\nAnd in some cases, in Cuba,\nMexico and India,\n\n00:11:46.774 --> 00:11:50.061\nthe dose can be reduced to 25 percent,\nand in several other cases,\n\n00:11:50.061 --> 00:11:52.215\nthere's no need to add\nany phosphorus at all,\n\n00:11:52.215 --> 00:11:54.659\nbecause the mushrooms are so well adapted\n\n00:11:54.659 --> 00:11:57.395\nto finding phosphorus\nand drawing it from the soil.\n\n00:11:57.855 --> 00:12:02.373\nThis is an example of soy production\nin Canada.\n\n00:12:03.693 --> 00:12:10.635\nMycorrhiza was used in one field\nbut not in the other.\n\n00:12:11.305 --> 00:12:19.231\nAnd here, where blue indicates a better yield,\nand yellow a weaker yield.\n\n00:12:20.721 --> 00:12:23.544\nThe black rectangle is the plot\n\n00:12:23.544 --> 00:12:25.927\nfrom which the mycorrhiza was added.\n\n00:12:25.927 --> 00:12:29.295\nIn other words, as I already said,\nI have invented nothing.\n\n00:12:29.295 --> 00:12:32.045\nMycorrhiza has existed\nfor 450 million years,\n\n00:12:32.045 --> 00:12:36.304\nand it has even helped\nmodern-day plant species to diversify.\n\n00:12:36.304 --> 00:12:40.863\nSo, this it isn't something\nthat is still undergoing lab tests.\n\n00:12:40.863 --> 00:12:43.279\nMycorrhiza exists, it works,\n\n00:12:43.279 --> 00:12:47.718\nit's produced at an industrial scale\nand commercialized worldwide.\n\n00:12:47.718 --> 00:12:51.028\nThe problem is\nthat people are not aware of it.\n\n00:12:51.028 --> 00:12:55.024\nPeople like food producers and farmers\nare still not aware of this problem.\n\n00:12:55.024 --> 00:12:57.652\nWe have a technology that works,\n\n00:12:57.652 --> 00:13:04.749\nand one that, if used correctly,\nwill alleviate some of the pressure\n\n00:13:04.749 --> 00:13:08.402\nwe are putting\non the world's phosphorus reserves.\n\n00:13:09.172 --> 00:13:13.636\nIn conclusion,\nI am a scientist and a dreamer.\n\n00:13:14.326 --> 00:13:16.085\nI'm passionate about this topic.\n\n00:13:16.085 --> 00:13:19.373\nSo if you were to ask me\nwhat my retirement dream is,\n\n00:13:19.373 --> 00:13:22.199\nwhich will be at the moment we reach\nthat phosphorus peak,\n\n00:13:22.199 --> 00:13:26.155\nit would be that we use one label,\n\"Made with mycorrhiza,\"\n\n00:13:26.155 --> 00:13:29.065\nand that my children and grandchildren\n\n00:13:29.065 --> 00:13:32.073\nbuy products bearing that label too.\n\n00:13:32.073 --> 00:13:33.773\nThank you for your attention.\n\n00:13:33.773 --> 00:13:36.274\n(Applause)"}, {"title": "Life in the \"digital now\"", "duration": "721", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/abha_dawesar_life_in_the_digital_now", "transcript": "I was in New York during Hurricane Sandy, and this little white dog called Maui was staying with me. Half the city was dark because of a power cut, and I was living on the dark side. Now, Maui was terrified of the dark, so I had to carry him up the stairs, actually down the stairs first, for his walk, and then bring him back up. I was also hauling gallons of bottles of water up to the seventh floor every day. And through all of this, I had to hold a torch between my teeth. The stores nearby were out of flashlights and batteries and bread. For a shower, I walked 40 blocks to a branch of my gym.But these were not the major preoccupations of my day. It was just as critical for me to be the first person in at a cafe nearby with extension cords and chargers to juice my multiple devices. I started to prospect under the benches of bakeries and the entrances of pastry shops for plug points. I wasn't the only one. Even in the rain, people stood between Madison and 5th Avenue under their umbrellas charging their cell phones from outlets on the street. Nature had just reminded us that it was stronger than all our technology, and yet here we were, obsessed about being wired.I think there's nothing like a crisis to tell you what's really important and what's not, and Sandy made me realize that our devices and their connectivity matter to us right up there with food and shelter. The self as we once knew it no longer exists, and I think that an abstract, digital universe has become a part of our identity, and I want to talk to you about what I think that means.I'm a novelist, and I'm interested in the self because the self and fiction have a lot in common. They're both stories, interpretations. You and I can experience things without a story. We might run up the stairs too quickly and we might get breathless. But the larger sense that we have of our lives, the slightly more abstract one, is indirect. Our story of our life is based on direct experience, but it's embellished. A novel needs scene after scene to build, and the story of our life needs an arc as well. It needs months and years. Discrete moments from our lives are its chapters. But the story is not about these chapters. It's the whole book. It's not only about the heartbreak and the happiness, the victories and the disappointments, but it's because how because of these, and sometimes, more importantly, in spite of these, we find our place in the world and we change it and we change ourselves. Our story, therefore, needs two dimensions of time: a long arc of time that is our lifespan, and the timeframe of direct experience that is the moment. Now the self that experiences directly can only exist in the moment, but the one that narrates needs several moments, a whole sequence of them, and that's why our full sense of self needs both immersive experience and the flow of time. Now, the flow of time is embedded in everything, in the erosion of a grain of sand, in the budding of a little bud into a rose. Without it, we would have no music. Our own emotions and state of mind often encode time, regret or nostalgia about the past, hope or dread about the future.I think that technology has altered that flow of time. The overall time that we have for our narrative, our lifespan, has been increasing, but the smallest measure, the moment, has shrunk. It has shrunk because our instruments enable us in part to measure smaller and smaller units of time, and this in turn has given us a more granular understanding of the material world, and this granular understanding has generated reams of data that our brains can no longer comprehend and for which we need more and more complicated computers. All of this to say that the gap between what we can perceive and what we can measure is only going to widen. Science can do things with and in a picosecond, but you and I are never going to have the inner experience of a millionth of a millionth of a second. You and I answer only to nature's rhythm and flow, to the sun, the moon and the seasons, and this is why we need that long arc of time with the past, the present and the future to see things for what they are, to separate signal from noise and the self from sensations. We need time's arrow to understand cause and effect, not just in the material world, but in our own intentions and our motivations. What happens when that arrow goes awry? What happens when time warps?So many of us today have the sensation that time's arrow is pointing everywhere and nowhere at once. This is because time doesn't flow in the digital world in the same way that it does in the natural one. We all know that the Internet has shrunk space as well as time. Far away over there is now here. News from India is a stream on my smartphone app whether I'm in New York or New Delhi. And that's not all. Your last job, your dinner reservations from last year, your former friends, lie on a flat plain with today's friends, because the Internet also archives, and it warps the past. With no distinction left between the past, the present and the future, and the here or there, we are left with this moment everywhere, this moment that I'll call the digital now.Just how can we prioritize in the landscape of the digital now? This digital now is not the present, because it's always a few seconds ahead, with Twitter streams that are already trending and news from other time zones. This isn't the now of a shooting pain in your foot or the second that you bite into a pastry or the three hours that you lose yourself in a great book. This now bears very little physical or psychological reference to our own state. Its focus, instead, is to distract us at every turn on the road. Every digital landmark is an invitation to leave what you are doing now to go somewhere else and do something else. Are you reading an interview by an author? Why not buy his book? Tweet it. Share it. Like it. Find other books exactly like his. Find other people reading those books. Travel can be liberating, but when it is incessant, we become permanent exiles without repose. Choice is freedom, but not when it's constantly for its own sake.Not just is the digital now far from the present, but it's in direct competition with it, and this is because not just am I absent from it, but so are you. Not just are we absent from it, but so is everyone else. And therein lies its greatest convenience and horror. I can order foreign language books in the middle of the night, shop for Parisian macarons, and leave video messages that get picked up later. At all times, I can operate at a different rhythm and pace from you, while I sustain the illusion that I'm tapped into you in real time.Sandy was a reminder of how such an illusion can shatter. There were those with power and water, and those without. There are those who went back to their lives, and those who are still displaced after so many months. For some reason, technology seems to perpetuate the illusion for those who have it that everyone does, and then, like an ironic slap in the face, it makes it true. For example, it's said that there are more people in India with access to cell phones than toilets. Now if this rift, which is already so great in many parts of the world, between the lack of infrastructure and the spread of technology, isn't somehow bridged, there will be ruptures between the digital and the real. For us as individuals who live in the digital now and spend most of our waking moments in it, the challenge is to live in two streams of time that are parallel and almost simultaneous. How does one live inside distraction?We might think that those younger than us, those who are born into this, will adapt more naturally. Possibly, but I remember my childhood. I remember my grandfather revising the capitals of the world with me. Buda and Pest were separated by the Danube, and Vienna had a Spanish riding school. If I were a child today, I could easily learn this information with apps and hyperlinks, but it really wouldn't be the same, because much later, I went to Vienna, and I went to the Spanish riding school, and I could feel my grandfather right beside me. Night after night, he took me up on the terrace, on his shoulders, and pointed out Jupiter and Saturn and the Great Bear to me. And even here, when I look at the Great Bear, I get back that feeling of being a child, hanging onto his head and trying to balance myself on his shoulder, and I can get back that feeling of being a child again. What I had with my grandfather was wrapped so often in information and knowledge and fact, but it was about so much more than information or knowledge or fact. Time-warping technology challenges our deepest core, because we are able to archive the past and some of it becomes hard to forget, even as the current moment is increasingly unmemorable. We want to clutch, and we are left instead clutching at a series of static moments. They're like soap bubbles that disappear when we touch them.By archiving everything, we think that we can store it, but time is not data. It cannot be stored. You and I know exactly what it means like to be truly present in a moment. It might have happened while we were playing an instrument, or looking into the eyes of someone we've known for a very long time. At such moments, our selves are complete. The self that lives in the long narrative arc and the self that experiences the moment become one. The present encapsulates the past and a promise for the future. The present joins a flow of time from before and after.I first experienced these feelings with my grandmother. I wanted to learn to skip, and she found an old rope and she tucked up her sari and she jumped over it. I wanted to learn to cook, and she kept me in the kitchen, cutting, cubing and chopping for a whole month. My grandmother taught me that things happen in the time they take, that time can't be fought, and because it will pass and it will move, we owe the present moment our full attention. Attention is time. One of my yoga instructors once said that love is attention, and definitely from my grandmother, love and attention were one and the same thing. The digital world cannibalizes time, and in doing so, I want to suggest that what it threatens is the completeness of ourselves. It threatens the flow of love. But we don't need to let it. We can choose otherwise. We've seen again and again just how creative technology can be, and in our lives and in our actions, we can choose those solutions and those innovations and those moments that restore the flow of time instead of fragmenting it. We can slow down and we can tune in to the ebb and flow of time. We can choose to take time back.Thank you.(Applause)", "id": 1856, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:12.504 --> 00:00:14.751\nI was in New York during Hurricane Sandy,\n\n00:00:14.751 --> 00:00:16.991\nand this little white dog called Maui\n\n00:00:16.991 --> 00:00:18.876\nwas staying with me.\n\n00:00:18.876 --> 00:00:21.348\nHalf the city was dark because of a power cut,\n\n00:00:21.348 --> 00:00:23.572\nand I was living on the dark side.\n\n00:00:23.572 --> 00:00:25.681\nNow, Maui was terrified of the dark,\n\n00:00:25.681 --> 00:00:27.785\nso I had to carry him up the stairs,\n\n00:00:27.785 --> 00:00:30.873\nactually down the stairs first, for his walk,\n\n00:00:30.873 --> 00:00:32.761\nand then bring him back up.\n\n00:00:32.761 --> 00:00:35.742\nI was also hauling gallons of bottles of water\n\n00:00:35.742 --> 00:00:37.841\nup to the seventh floor every day.\n\n00:00:37.841 --> 00:00:39.414\nAnd through all of this,\n\n00:00:39.414 --> 00:00:41.718\nI had to hold a torch between my teeth.\n\n00:00:41.718 --> 00:00:44.362\nThe stores nearby were out of flashlights\n\n00:00:44.362 --> 00:00:47.299\nand batteries and bread.\n\n00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:49.962\nFor a shower, I walked 40 blocks\n\n00:00:49.962 --> 00:00:51.936\nto a branch of my gym.\n\n00:00:51.936 --> 00:00:55.015\nBut these were not the major preoccupations of my day.\n\n00:00:55.015 --> 00:00:58.316\nIt was just as critical for me to be the first person in\n\n00:00:58.316 --> 00:01:01.608\nat a cafe nearby with extension cords and chargers\n\n00:01:01.608 --> 00:01:03.457\nto juice my multiple devices.\n\n00:01:03.457 --> 00:01:06.182\nI started to prospect under the benches of bakeries\n\n00:01:06.182 --> 00:01:09.807\nand the entrances of pastry shops for plug points.\n\n00:01:09.807 --> 00:01:11.376\nI wasn't the only one.\n\n00:01:11.376 --> 00:01:15.140\nEven in the rain, people stood between Madison and 5th Avenue\n\n00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:17.604\nunder their umbrellas charging their cell phones\n\n00:01:17.604 --> 00:01:19.641\nfrom outlets on the street.\n\n00:01:19.641 --> 00:01:21.898\nNature had just reminded us\n\n00:01:21.898 --> 00:01:24.214\nthat it was stronger than all our technology,\n\n00:01:24.214 --> 00:01:27.483\nand yet here we were, obsessed about being wired.\n\n00:01:27.483 --> 00:01:29.359\nI think there's nothing like a crisis\n\n00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:32.548\nto tell you what's really important and what's not,\n\n00:01:32.548 --> 00:01:36.110\nand Sandy made me realize that our devices\n\n00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:38.376\nand their connectivity matter to us\n\n00:01:38.376 --> 00:01:42.894\nright up there with food and shelter.\n\n00:01:42.894 --> 00:01:46.211\nThe self as we once knew it no longer exists,\n\n00:01:46.211 --> 00:01:48.703\nand I think that an abstract, digital universe\n\n00:01:48.703 --> 00:01:51.228\nhas become a part of our identity,\n\n00:01:51.228 --> 00:01:55.480\nand I want to talk to you about what I think that means.\n\n00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:58.323\nI'm a novelist, and I'm interested in the self\n\n00:01:58.323 --> 00:02:00.792\nbecause the self and fiction have a lot in common.\n\n00:02:00.792 --> 00:02:04.109\nThey're both stories, interpretations.\n\n00:02:04.109 --> 00:02:06.562\nYou and I can experience things without a story.\n\n00:02:06.562 --> 00:02:08.644\nWe might run up the stairs too quickly\n\n00:02:08.644 --> 00:02:10.331\nand we might get breathless.\n\n00:02:10.331 --> 00:02:12.861\nBut the larger sense that we have of our lives,\n\n00:02:12.861 --> 00:02:16.221\nthe slightly more abstract one, is indirect.\n\n00:02:16.221 --> 00:02:19.341\nOur story of our life is based on direct experience,\n\n00:02:19.341 --> 00:02:21.235\nbut it's embellished.\n\n00:02:21.235 --> 00:02:24.083\nA novel needs scene after scene to build,\n\n00:02:24.083 --> 00:02:27.231\nand the story of our life needs an arc as well.\n\n00:02:27.231 --> 00:02:29.922\nIt needs months and years.\n\n00:02:29.922 --> 00:02:32.940\nDiscrete moments from our lives are its chapters.\n\n00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:35.530\nBut the story is not about these chapters.\n\n00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:37.475\nIt's the whole book.\n\n00:02:37.475 --> 00:02:40.818\nIt's not only about the heartbreak and the happiness,\n\n00:02:40.818 --> 00:02:42.997\nthe victories and the disappointments,\n\n00:02:42.997 --> 00:02:45.202\nbut it's because how because of these,\n\n00:02:45.202 --> 00:02:48.355\nand sometimes, more importantly, in spite of these,\n\n00:02:48.355 --> 00:02:50.450\nwe find our place in the world\n\n00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:53.530\nand we change it and we change ourselves.\n\n00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:56.923\nOur story, therefore, needs two dimensions of time:\n\n00:02:56.923 --> 00:02:59.938\na long arc of time that is our lifespan,\n\n00:02:59.938 --> 00:03:02.441\nand the timeframe of direct experience\n\n00:03:02.441 --> 00:03:03.894\nthat is the moment.\n\n00:03:03.894 --> 00:03:06.024\nNow the self that experiences directly\n\n00:03:06.024 --> 00:03:07.925\ncan only exist in the moment,\n\n00:03:07.925 --> 00:03:10.687\nbut the one that narrates needs several moments,\n\n00:03:10.687 --> 00:03:12.801\na whole sequence of them,\n\n00:03:12.801 --> 00:03:15.046\nand that's why our full sense of self\n\n00:03:15.046 --> 00:03:17.978\nneeds both immersive experience\n\n00:03:17.978 --> 00:03:20.423\nand the flow of time.\n\n00:03:20.423 --> 00:03:23.572\nNow, the flow of time is embedded in everything,\n\n00:03:23.572 --> 00:03:26.140\nin the erosion of a grain of sand,\n\n00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:29.932\nin the

it,\n\n00:08:10.113 --> 00:08:12.290\nthe challenge is to live in two streams of time\n\n00:08:12.290 --> 00:08:15.234\nthat are parallel and almost simultaneous.\n\n00:08:15.234 --> 00:08:19.334\nHow does one live inside distraction?\n\n00:08:19.334 --> 00:08:21.284\nWe might think that those younger than us,\n\n00:08:21.284 --> 00:08:24.898\nthose who are born into this, will adapt more naturally.\n\n00:08:24.898 --> 00:08:28.036\nPossibly, but I remember my childhood.\n\n00:08:28.036 --> 00:08:29.740\nI remember my grandfather revising\n\n00:08:29.740 --> 00:08:32.002\nthe capitals of the world with me.\n\n00:08:32.002 --> 00:08:34.752\nBuda and Pest were separated by the Danube,\n\n00:08:34.752 --> 00:08:37.527\nand Vienna had a Spanish riding school.\n\n00:08:37.527 --> 00:08:40.426\nIf I were a child today, I could easily learn this information\n\n00:08:40.426 --> 00:08:42.591\nwith apps and hyperlinks,\n\n00:08:42.591 --> 00:08:44.502\nbut it really wouldn't be the same,\n\n00:08:44.502 --> 00:08:46.782\nbecause much later, I went to Vienna,\n\n00:08:46.782 --> 00:08:48.750\nand I went to the Spanish riding school,\n\n00:08:48.750 --> 00:08:52.115\nand I could feel my grandfather right beside me.\n\n00:08:52.115 --> 00:08:54.685\nNight after night, he took me up on the terrace,\n\n00:08:54.685 --> 00:08:57.463\non his shoulders, and pointed out Jupiter\n\n00:08:57.463 --> 00:09:00.691\nand Saturn and the Great Bear to me.\n\n00:09:00.691 --> 00:09:03.386\nAnd even here, when I look at the Great Bear,\n\n00:09:03.386 --> 00:09:06.142\nI get back that feeling of being a child,\n\n00:09:06.142 --> 00:09:08.520\nhanging onto his head and trying to balance myself\n\n00:09:08.520 --> 00:09:10.740\non his shoulder,\n\n00:09:10.740 --> 00:09:13.940\nand I can get back that feeling of being a child again.\n\n00:09:13.940 --> 00:09:16.407\nWhat I had with my grandfather was wrapped\n\n00:09:16.407 --> 00:09:19.649\nso often in information and knowledge and fact,\n\n00:09:19.649 --> 00:09:21.673\nbut it was about so much more\n\n00:09:21.673 --> 00:09:25.463\nthan information or knowledge or fact.\n\n00:09:25.463 -->

00:09:36.547\nand some of it becomes hard to forget,\n\n00:09:36.547 --> 00:09:39.151\neven as the current moment\n\n00:09:39.151 --> 00:09:41.770\nis increasingly unmemorable.\n\n00:09:41.770 --> 00:09:44.510\nWe want to clutch, and we are left instead\n\n00:09:44.510 --> 00:09:46.973\nclutching at a series of static moments.\n\n00:09:46.973 --> 00:09:49.679\nThey're like soap bubbles that disappear when we touch them.\n\n00:09:49.679 --> 00:09:52.472\nBy archiving everything, we think that we can store it,\n\n00:09:52.472 --> 00:09:54.437\nbut time is not data.\n\n00:09:54.437 --> 00:09:56.570\nIt cannot be stored.\n\n00:09:56.570 --> 00:09:58.586\nYou and I know exactly what it means like\n\n00:09:58.586 --> 00:10:00.490\nto be truly present in a moment.\n\n00:10:00.490 --> 00:10:01.707\nIt might have happened while we were\n\n00:10:01.707 --> 00:10:03.466\nplaying an instrument,\n\n00:10:03.466 --> 00:10:05.314\nor looking into the eyes of someone we've known\n\n00:10:05.314 --> 00:10:07.498\nfor a very long time.\n\n00:10:07.498 --> 00:10:10.529\nAt such moments, our selves are complete.\n\n00:10:10.529 --> 00:10:12.597\nThe self that lives in the long narrative arc\n\n00:10:12.597 --> 00:10:14.680\nand the self that experiences the moment\n\n00:10:14.680 --> 00:10:16.072\nbecome one.\n\n00:10:16.072 --> 00:10:18.014\nThe present encapsulates the past\n\n00:10:18.014 --> 00:10:20.445\nand a promise for the future.\n\n00:10:20.445 --> 00:10:22.413\nThe present joins a flow of time\n\n00:10:22.413 --> 00:10:24.656\nfrom before and after.\n\n00:10:24.656 --> 00:10:28.213\nI first experienced these feelings with my grandmother.\n\n00:10:28.213 --> 00:10:30.552\nI wanted to learn to skip, and she found an old rope\n\n00:10:30.552 --> 00:10:31.904\nand she tucked up her sari\n\n00:10:31.904 --> 00:10:33.632\nand she jumped over it.\n\n00:10:33.632 --> 00:10:36.286\nI wanted to learn to cook, and she kept me in the kitchen,\n\n00:10:36.286 --> 00:10:40.394\ncutting, cubing and chopping for a whole month.\n\n00:10:40.394 --> 00:10:42.801\nMy grandmother taught me that things happen\n\n00:10:42.801 --> 00:10:46.522\nin the time they take, that time can't be fought,\n\n00:10:46.522 --> 00:10:48.355\nand because it will pass and it will move,\n\n00:10:48.355 --> 00:10:51.469\nwe owe the present moment our full attention.\n\n00:10:51.469 --> 00:10:54.113\nAttention is time.\n\n00:10:54.113 --> 00:10:56.296\nOne of my yoga instructors once said\n\n00:10:56.296 --> 00:10:58.539\nthat love is attention,\n\n00:10:58.539 --> 00:11:00.373\nand definitely from my grandmother,\n\n00:11:00.373 --> 00:11:04.699\nlove and attention were one and the same thing.\n\n00:11:04.699 --> 00:11:07.282\nThe digital world cannibalizes time,\n\n00:11:07.282 --> 00:11:10.662\nand in doing so, I want to suggest\n\n00:11:10.662 --> 00:11:12.336\nthat what it threatens\n\n00:11:12.336 --> 00:11:14.766\nis the completeness of ourselves.\n\n00:11:14.766 --> 00:11:17.124\nIt threatens the flow of love.\n\n00:11:17.124 --> 00:11:19.145\nBut we don't need to let it.\n\n00:11:19.145 --> 00:11:20.613\nWe can choose otherwise.\n\n00:11:20.613 --> 00:11:22.690\nWe've seen again and again\n\n00:11:22.690 --> 00:11:24.920\njust how creative technology can be,\n\n00:11:24.920 --> 00:11:27.160\nand in our lives and in our actions,\n\n00:11:27.160 --> 00:11:31.149\nwe can choose those solutions and those innovations\n\n00:11:31.149 --> 00:11:34.257\nand those moments that restore the flow of time\n\n00:11:34.257 --> 00:11:37.878\ninstead of fragmenting it.\n\n00:11:37.878 --> 00:11:40.458\nWe can slow down and we can tune in\n\n00:11:40.458 --> 00:11:43.130\nto the ebb and flow of time.\n\n00:11:43.130 --> 00:11:47.078\nWe can choose to take time back.\n\n00:11:47.078 --> 00:11:49.278\nThank you.\n\n00:11:49.278 --> 00:11:53.278\n(Applause)"}, {"title": "Why stay in Chernobyl? Because it's home.", "duration": "531", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/holly_morris_why_stay_in_chernobyl_because_it_s_home", "transcript": "Three years ago, I was standing about a hundred yards from Chernobyl nuclear reactor number four. My Geiger counter dosimeter, which measures radiation, was going berserk, and the closer I got, the more frenetic it became, and frantic. My God.I was there covering the 25th anniversary of the world's worst nuclear accident, as you can see by the look on my face, reluctantly so, but with good reason, because the nuclear fire that burned for 11 days back in 1986 released 400 times as much radiation as the bomb dropped on Hiroshima, and the sarcophagus, which is the covering over reactor number four, which was hastily built 27 years ago, now sits cracked and rusted and leaking radiation.So I was filming. I just wanted to get the job done and get out of there fast. But then, I looked into the distance, and I saw some smoke coming from a farmhouse, and I'm thinking, who could be living here? I mean, after all, Chernobyl's soil, water and air, are among the most highly contaminated on Earth, and the reactor sits at the the center of a tightly regulated exclusion zone, or dead zone, and it's a nuclear police state, complete with border guards. You have to have dosimeter at all times, clicking away, you have to have a government minder, and there's draconian radiation rules and constant contamination monitoring. The point being, no human being should be living anywhere near the dead zone. But they are.It turns out an unlikely community of some 200 people are living inside the zone. They're called self-settlers. And almost all of them are women, the men having shorter lifespans in part due to overuse of alcohol, cigarettes, if not radiation. Hundreds of thousands of people were evacuated at the time of the accident, but not everybody accepted that fate. The women in the zone, now in their 70s and 80s, are the last survivors of a group who defied authorities and, it would seem, common sense, and returned to their ancestral homes inside the zone. They did so illegally. As one woman put it to a soldier who was trying to evacuate her for a second time, \"Shoot me and dig the grave. Otherwise, I'm going home.\"Now why would they return to such deadly soil? I mean, were they unaware of the risks or crazy enough to ignore them, or both? The thing is, they see their lives and the risks they run decidedly differently.Now around Chernobyl, there are scattered ghost villages, eerily silent, strangely charming, bucolic, totally contaminated. Many were bulldozed under at the time of the accident, but a few are left like this, kind of silent vestiges to the tragedy. Others have a few residents in them, one or two \"babushkas,\" or \"babas,\" which are the Russian and Ukrainian words for grandmother. Another village might have six or seven residents. So this is the strange demographic of the zone \u2014 isolated alone together.And when I made my way to that piping chimney I'd seen in the distance, I saw Hanna Zavorotnya, and I met her. She's the self-declared mayor of Kapavati village, population eight. (Laughter) And she said to me, when I asked her the obvious, \"Radiation doesn't scare me. Starvation does.\"And you have to remember, these women have survived the worst atrocities of the 20th century. Stalin's enforced famines of the 1930s, the Holodomor, killed millions of Ukrainians, and they faced the Nazis in the '40s, who came through slashing, burning, raping, and in fact many of these women were shipped to Germany as forced labor. So when a couple decades into Soviet rule, Chernobyl happened, they were unwilling to flee in the face of an enemy that was invisible. So they returned to their villages and are told they're going to get sick and die soon, but five happy years, their logic goes, is better than 10 stuck in a high rise on the outskirts of Kiev, separated from the graves of their mothers and fathers and babies, the whisper of stork wings on a spring afternoon. For them, environmental contamination may not be the worst sort of devastation. It turns out this holds true for other species as well. Wild boar, lynx, moose, they've all returned to the region in force, the very real, very negative effects of radiation being trumped by the upside of a mass exodus of humans. The dead zone, it turns out, is full of life.And there is a kind of heroic resilience, a kind of plain-spoken pragmatism to those who start their day at 5 a.m. pulling water from a well and end it at midnight poised to beat a bucket with a stick and scare off wild boar that might mess with their potatoes, their only company a bit of homemade moonshine vodka. And there's a patina of simple defiance among them. \"They told us our legs would hurt, and they do. So what?\" I mean, what about their health? The benefits of hardy, physical living, but an environment made toxic by a complicated, little-understood enemy, radiation. It's incredibly difficult to parse. Health studies from the region are conflicting and fraught. The World Health Organization puts the number of Chernobyl-related deaths at 4,000, eventually. Greenpeace and other organizations put that number in the tens of thousands. Now everybody agrees that thyroid cancers are sky high, and that Chernobyl evacuees suffer the trauma of relocated peoples everywhere: higher levels of anxiety, depression, alcoholism, unemployment and, importantly, disrupted social networks.Now, like many of you, I have moved maybe 20, 25 times in my life. Home is a transient concept. I have a deeper connection to my laptop than any bit of soil. So it's hard for us to understand, but home is the entire cosmos of the rural babushka, and connection to the land is palpable. And perhaps because these Ukrainian women were schooled under the Soviets and versed in the Russian poets, aphorisms about these ideas slip from their mouths all the time.\"If you leave, you die.\"\"Those who left are worse off now. They are dying of sadness.\"\"Motherland is motherland. I will never leave.\"What sounds like faith, soft faith, may actually be fact, because the surprising truth \u2014 I mean, there are no studies, but the truth seems to be that these women who returned to their homes and have lived on some of the most radioactive land on Earth for the last 27 years, have actually outlived their counterparts who accepted relocation, by some estimates up to 10 years.How could this be? Here's a theory: Could it be that those ties to ancestral soil, the soft variables reflected in their aphorisms, actually affect longevity? The power of motherland so fundamental to that part of the world seems palliative. Home and community are forces that rival even radiation.Now radiation or not, these women are at the end of their lives. In the next decade, the zone's human residents will be gone, and it will revert to a wild, radioactive place, full only of animals and occasionally daring, flummoxed scientists. But the spirit and existence of the babushkas, whose numbers have been halved in the three years I've known them, will leave us with powerful new templates to think about and grapple with, about the relative nature of risk, about transformative connections to home, and about the magnificent tonic of personal agency and self-determination.Thank you.(Applause)", "id": 1857, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:12.358 --> 00:00:15.447\nThree years ago, I was standing about a hundred yards\n\n00:00:15.447 --> 00:00:19.073\nfrom Chernobyl nuclear reactor number four.\n\n00:00:19.073 --> 00:00:22.220\nMy Geiger counter dosimeter, which measures radiation,\n\n00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:23.808\nwas going berserk,\n\n00:00:23.808 --> 00:00:27.255\nand the closer I got, the more frenetic it became,\n\n00:00:27.255 --> 00:00:30.051\nand frantic.

they run decidedly differently.\n\n00:02:47.077 --> 00:02:50.330\nNow around Chernobyl, there are scattered ghost villages,\n\n00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:54.661\neerily silent, strangely charming,

are left like this,\n\n00:03:01.756 --> 00:03:05.309\nkind of silent vestiges to the tragedy.\n\n00:03:05.309 --> 00:03:07.620\nOthers have a few residents in them,\n\n00:03:07.620 -->

might have six or seven residents.\n\n00:03:16.357 --> 00:03:19.087\nSo this is the strange demographic of the zone --\n\n00:03:19.087 --> 00:03:21.956\nisolated alone together.\n\n00:03:21.956 -->

Well, I can tell you that, in the rigid structure and highly competitive nature of the Korean school system, also known as pressure cooker, not everyone can do well in that environment. While many people responded in different ways about our education system, my response to the high-pressure environment was making bows with pieces of wood found near my apartment building.Why bows? I'm not quite sure. Perhaps, in the face of constant pressure, my caveman instinct of survival has connected with the bows. If you think about it, the bow has really helped drive human survival since prehistoric times. The area within three kilometers of my home used to be a mulberry forest during the Joseon dynasty, where silkworms were fed with mulberry leaves. In order to raise the historical awareness of this fact, the government has planted mulberry trees. The seeds from these trees also have spread by birds here and there nearby the soundproof walls of the city expressway that has been built around the 1988 Olympics. The area near these walls, which nobody bothers to pay attention to, had been left free from major intervention, and this is where I first found my treasures.As I fell deeper into bow making, I began to search far and beyond my neighborhood. When I went on school field trips, family vacations, or simply on my way home from extracurricular classes, I wandered around wooded areas and gathered tree branches with the tools that I sneaked inside my school bag. And they would be somethings like saws, knives, sickles and axes that I covered up with a piece of towel. I would bring the branches home, riding buses and subways, barely holding them in my hands.And I did not bring the tools here to Long Beach. Airport security.(Laughter) In the privacy of my room, covered in sawdust, I would saw, trim and polish wood all night long until a bow took shape.One day, I was changing the shape of a bamboo piece and ended up setting the place on fire. Where? The rooftop of my apartment building, a place where 96 families call home. A customer from a department store across from my building called 911, and I ran downstairs to tell my mom with half of my hair burned. I want to take this opportunity to tell my mom, in the audience today: Mom, I was really sorry, and I will be more careful with open fire from now on.My mother had to do a lot of explaining, telling people that her son did not commit a premeditated arson.I also researched extensively on bows around the world. In that process, I tried to combine the different bows from across time and places to create the most effective bow. I also worked with many different types of wood, such as maple, yew and mulberry, and did many shooting experiments in the wooded area near the urban expressway that I mentioned before.The most effective bow for me would be like this.One: Curved tips can maximize the springiness when you draw and shoot the arrow.Two: Belly is drawn inward for higher draw weight, which means more power.Three: Sinew used in the outer layer of the limb for maximum tension storage.And four: Horn used to store energy in compression.After fixing, breaking, redesigning, mending, bending and amending, my ideal bow began to take shape, and when it was finally done, it looked like this. I was so proud of myself for inventing a perfect bow on my own. This is a picture of Korean traditional bows taken from a museum, and see how my bow resembles them. Thanks to my ancestors for robbing me of my invention. (Laughter)Through bowmaking, I came in contact with part of my heritage. Learning the information that has accumulated over time and reading the message left by my ancestors were better than any consolation therapy or piece of advice any living adults could give me. You see, I searched far and wide, but never bothered to look close and near. From this realization, I began to take interest in Korean history, which had never inspired me before. In the end, the grass is often greener on my side of the fence, although we don't realize it.Now, I am going to show you how my bow works. And let's see how this one works. This is a bamboo bow, with 45-pound draw weights. (Noise of shooting arrow) (Applause)A bow may function in a simple mechanism, but in order to make a good bow, a great amount of sensitivity is required. You need to console and communicate with the wood material. Each fiber in the wood has its own reason and function for being, and only through cooperation and harmony among them comes a great bow.

For two straight days, the city became an open battlefield between the federal forces and a well-organized group, presumably from the local criminal organization, La Familia Michoacana, or the Michoac\u00e1n family. The citizens didn't only experience incessant gunfire but also explosions and burning trucks used as barricades across the city, so truly like a battlefield. After these two days, and during a particularly intense encounter, it was presumed that the leader of La Familia Michoacana, Nazario Moreno, was killed.In response to this terrifying violence, the mayor of Apatzing\u00e1n decided to call the citizens to a march for peace. The idea was to ask for a softer approach to criminal activity in the state. And so, the day of the scheduled procession, thousands of people showed up. As the mayor was preparing to deliver the speech starting the march, his team noticed that, while half of the participants were appropriately dressed in white, and bearing banners asking for peace, the other half was actually marching in support of the criminal organization and its now-presumed-defunct leader. Shocked, the mayor decided to step aside rather than participate or lead a procession that was ostensibly in support of organized crime. And so his team stepped aside. The two marches joined together, and they continued their path towards the state capital.This story of horrific violence followed by a fumbled approach by federal and local authorities as they tried to engage civil society, who has been very well engaged by a criminal organization, is a perfect metaphor for what's happening in Mexico today, where we see that our current understanding of drug violence and what leads to it is probably at the very least incomplete.If you decided to spend 30 minutes trying to figure out what's going on with drug violence in Mexico by, say, just researching online, the first thing you would find out is that while the laws state that all Mexican citizens are equal, there are some that are more and there are some that are much less equal than others, because you will quickly find out that in the past six years anywhere between 60 and 100,000 people have lost their lives in drug-related violence. To put these numbers in perspective, this is eight times larger than the number of casualties in the Iraq and Afghanistan wars combined. It's also shockingly close to the number of people who have died in the Syrian civil war, which is an active civil war. This is happening just south of the border.Now as you're reading, however, you will be maybe surprised that you will quickly become numb to the numbers of deaths, because you will see that these are sort of abstract numbers of faceless, nameless dead people. Implicitly or explicitly, there is a narrative that all the people who are dying were somehow involved in the drug trade, and we infer this because they were either tortured or executed in a professional manner, or, most likely, both. And so clearly they were criminals because of the way they died. And so the narrative is that somehow these people got what they were deserved. They were part of the bad guys. And that creates some form of comfort for a lot of people.However, while it's easier to think of us, the citizens, the police, the army, as the good guys, and them, the narcos, the carteles, as the bad guys, if you think about it, the latter are only providing a service to the former. Whether we like it or not, the U.S. is the largest market for illegal substances in the world, accounting for more than half of global demand. It shares thousands of miles of border with Mexico that is its only route of access from the South, and so, as the former dictator of Mexico, Porfirio Diaz, used to say, \"Poor Mexico, so far from God and so close to the United States.\"The U.N. estimates that there are 55 million users of illegal drugs in the United States. Using very, very conservative assumptions, this yields a yearly drug market on the retail side of anywhere between 30 and 150 billion dollars. If we assume that the narcos only have access to the wholesale part, which we know is false, that still leaves you with yearly revenues of anywhere between 15 billion and 60 billion dollars. To put these numbers in perspective, Microsoft has yearly revenues of 60 billion dollars. And it so happens that this is a product that, because of its nature, a business model to address this market requires you to guarantee to your producers that their product will be reliably placed in the markets where it is consumed. And the only way to do this, because it's illegal, is to have absolute control of the geographic corridors that are used to transport drugs. Hence the violence. If you look at a map of cartel influence and violence, you will see that it almost perfectly aligns with the most efficient routes of transportation from the south to the north. The only thing that the cartels are doing is that they're trying to protect their business.It's not only a multi-billion dollar market, but it's also a complex one. For example, the coca plant is a fragile plant that can only grow in certain latitudes, and so it means that a business model to address this market requires you to have decentralized, international production, that by the way needs to have good quality control, because people need a good high that is not going to kill them and that is going to be delivered to them when they need it. And so that means they need to secure production and quality control in the south, and you need to ensure that you have efficient and effective distribution channels in the markets where these drugs are consumed. I urge you, but only a little bit, because I don't want to get you in trouble, to just ask around and see how difficult it would be to get whatever drug you want, wherever you want it, whenever you want it, anywhere in the U.S., and some of you may be surprised to know that there are many dealers that offer a service where if you send them a text message, they guarantee delivery of the drug in 30 minutes or less.Think about this for a second. Think about the complexity of the distribution network that I just described. It's very difficult to reconcile this with the image of faceless, ignorant goons that are just shooting each other, very difficult to reconcile.Now, as a business professor, and as any business professor would tell you, an effective organization requires an integrated strategy that includes a good organizational structure, good incentives, a solid identity and good brand management. This leads me to the second thing that you would learn in your 30-minute exploration of drug violence in Mexico. Because you would quickly realize, and maybe be confused by the fact, that there are three organizations that are constantly named in the articles. You will hear about Los Zetas, the Knights Templar, which is the new brand for the Familia Michoacana that I spoke about at the beginning, and the Sinaloa Federation. You will read that Los Zetas is this assortment of sociopaths that terrify the cities that they enter and they silence the press, and this is somewhat true, or mostly true. But this is the result of a very careful branding and business strategy. You see, Los Zetas is not just this random assortment of individuals, but was actually created by another criminal organization, the Gulf Cartel, that used to control the eastern corridor of Mexico. When that corridor became contested, they decided that they wanted to recruit a professional enforcement arm. So they recruited Los Zetas: an entire unit of elite paratroopers from the Mexican Army. They were incredibly effective as enforcers for the Gulf Cartel, so much so that at some point, they decided to just take over the operations, which is why I ask you to never keep tigers as pets, because they grow up. Because the Zetas organization was founded in treason, they lost some of the linkages to the production and distribution in the most profitable markets like cocaine, but what they did have, and this is again based on their military origin, was a perfectly structured chain of command with a very clear hierarchy and a very clear promotion path that allowed them to supervise and operate across many, many markets very effectively, which is the essence of what a chain of command seeks to do. And so because they didn't have access to the more profitable drug markets, this pushed them and gave them the opportunity to diversify into other forms of crime. That includes kidnapping, prostitution, local drug dealing and human trafficking, including of migrants that go from the south to the U.S. So what they currently run is truly and quite literally a franchise business. They focus most of their recruiting on the army, and they very openly advertise for better salaries, better benefits, better promotion paths, not to mention much better food, than what the army can deliver. The way they operate is that when they arrive in a locality, they let people know that they are there, and they go to the most powerful local gang and they say, \"I offer you to be the local representative of the Zeta brand.\" If they agree \u2014 and you don't want to know what happens if they don't \u2014 they train them and they supervise them on how to run the most efficient criminal operation for that town, in exchange for royalties. This kind of business model obviously depends entirely on having a very effective brand of fear, and so Los Zetas carefully stage acts of violence that are spectacular in nature, especially when they arrive first in a city, but again, that's just a brand strategy. I'm not saying they're not violent, but what I am saying is that even though you will read that they are the most violent of all, when you count, when you do the body count, they're actually all the same.In contrast to them, the Knights Templar that arose in Michoac\u00e1n emerged in reaction to the incursion of the Zetas into the state of Michoac\u00e1n. Michoac\u00e1n is a geographically strategic state because it has one of the largest ports in Mexico, and it has very direct routes to the center of Mexico, which then gives you direct access to the U.S. The Knights Templar realized very quickly that they couldn't face the Zetas on violence alone, and so they developed a strategy as a social enterprise. They brand themselves as representative of and protecting of the citizens of Michoac\u00e1n against organized crime. Their brand of social enterprise means that they require a lot of civic engagement, so they invest heavily in providing local services, like dealing with home violence, going after petty criminals, treating addicts, and keeping drugs out of the local markets where they are, and, of course, protecting people from other criminal organizations. Now, they kill a lot of people too, but when they kill them, they provide very careful narratives and descriptions for why they did them, through newspaper insertions, YouTube videos, and billboards that explain that the people who were killed were killed because they represented a threat not to us, as an organization, of course, but to you, as citizens. And so we're actually here to protect you. They, as social enterprises do, have created a moral and ethical code that they advertise around, and they have very strict recruiting practices. And here you have the types of explanations that they provide for some of their actions. They have actually retained access to the profitable drug trade, but the way they do it is, because they control all of Michoac\u00e1n, and they control the Port of L\u00e1zaro C\u00e1rdenas, they leverage that to, for example, trade copper from Michoac\u00e1n that is legally created and legally extracted with illegal ephedrine from China which is a critical precursor for methamphetamines that they produce, and then they have partnerships with larger organizations like the Sinaloa Federation that place their products in the U.S.Finally, the Sinaloa Federation. When you read about them, you will often read about them with an undertone of reverence and admiration, because they are the most integrated and the largest of all the Mexican organizations, and, many people argue, the world. They started as just sort of a transport organization that specialized in smuggling between the U.S. and the Mexican borders, but now they have grown into a truly integrated multinational that has partnerships in production in the south and partnerships in global distribution across the planet. They have cultivated a brand of professionalism, business acumen and innovation. They have designed new drug products and new drug processes. They have designed narco-tunnels that go across the border, and you can see that these are not \"The Shawshank Redemption\" types. They have invented narco-submarines and boats that are not detected by radar. They have invented drones to transport drugs, catapults, you name it. One of the leaders of the Sinaloa Federation actually made it to the Forbes list.[#701 Joaquin Guzman Loera]Like any multinational would, they have specialized and focused only in the most profitable part of the business, which is high-margin drugs like cocaine, heroine, methamphetamines. Like any traditional Latin American multinational would, the way they control their operations is through family ties. When they're entering a new market, they send a family member to supervise it, or, if they're partnering with a new organization, they create a family tie, either through marriages or other types of ties. Like any other multinational would, they protect their brand by outsourcing the more questionable parts of the business model, like for example, when they have to engage in violence against other criminal organizations, they recruit gangs and other smaller players to do the dirty work for them, and they try to separate their operations and their violence and be very discrete about this.To further strengthen their brand, they actually have professional P.R. firms that shape how the press talks about them. They have professional videographers on staff. They have incredibly productive ties with the security organizations on both sides of the border.And so, differences aside, what these three organizations share is on the one hand, a very clear understanding that institutions cannot be imposed from the top, but rather they are built from the bottom up one interaction at a time. They have created extremely coherent structures that they use to show the inconsistencies in government policies.And so what I want you to remember from this talk are three things. The first one is that drug violence is actually the result of a huge market demand and an institutional setup that forces the servicing of this market to necessitate violence to guarantee delivery routes. The second thing I want you to remember is that these are sophisticated, coherent organizations that are business organizations, and analyzing them and treating them as such is probably a much more useful approach. The third thing I want you to remember is that even though we're more comfortable with this idea of \"them,\" a set of bad guys separated from us, we are actually accomplices to them, either through our direct consumption or through our acceptance of the inconsistency between our policies of prohibition and our actual behavior of tolerance or even encouragement of consumption.These organizations service, recruit from, and operate within our communities, so necessarily, they are much more integrated within them than we are comfortable acknowledging. And so to me the question is not whether these dynamics will continue the way they have. We see that the nature of this phenomenon guarantees that they will. The question is whether we are willing to continue our support of a failed strategy based on our stubborn, blissful, voluntary ignorance at the cost of the deaths of thousands of our young.Thank you.(Applause)", "id": 1859, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:13.575 --> 00:00:17.251\nIn December of 2010,\n\n00:00:17.251 --> 00:00:19.068\nthe city of Apatzing\u00e1n\n\n00:00:19.068 --> 00:00:22.220\nin the coastal state of Michoac\u00e1n, in Mexico,\n\n00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:24.590\nawoke to gunfire.\n\n00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:26.166\nFor two straight days,\n\n00:00:26.166 --> 00:00:28.584\nthe city became an open battlefield\n\n00:00:28.584 --> 00:00:30.368\nbetween the federal forces\n\n00:00:30.368 --> 00:00:32.037\nand a well-organized group,\n\n00:00:32.037 --> 00:00:34.820\npresumably from the local criminal organization,\n\n00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:38.192\nLa Familia Michoacana, or the Michoac\u00e1n family.\n\n00:00:38.192 --> 00:00:41.342\nThe citizens didn't only experience incessant gunfire\n\n00:00:41.342 --> 00:00:43.762\nbut also explosions\n\n00:00:43.762 --> 00:00:47.033\nand burning trucks used as barricades across the city,\n\n00:00:47.033 --> 00:00:49.050\nso truly like a battlefield.\n\n00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:50.580\nAfter these two days,\n\n00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:53.385\nand during a particularly intense encounter,\n\n00:00:53.385 --> 00:00:55.952\nit was presumed that the leader of La Familia Michoacana,\n\n00:00:55.952 --> 00:00:58.457\nNazario Moreno, was killed.\n\n00:00:58.457 --> 00:01:00.468\nIn response to this terrifying violence,\n\n00:01:00.468 --> 00:01:02.467\nthe mayor of Apatzing\u00e1n\n\n00:01:02.467 --> 00:01:04.767\ndecided to call the citizens to a march for peace.\n\n00:01:04.767 --> 00:01:08.114\nThe idea was to ask for a softer approach\n\n00:01:08.114 --> 00:01:10.532\nto criminal activity in the state.\n\n00:01:10.532 --> 00:01:13.726\nAnd so, the day of the scheduled procession,\n\n00:01:13.726 --> 00:01:15.580\nthousands of people showed up.\n\n00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:17.274\nAs the mayor was preparing to deliver\n\n00:01:17.274 --> 00:01:19.385\nthe speech starting the march,\n\n00:01:19.385 --> 00:01:20.887\nhis team noticed\n\n00:01:20.887 --> 00:01:24.045\nthat, while half of the participants\n\n00:01:24.045 --> 00:01:25.720\nwere appropriately dressed in white,\n\n00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:28.560\nand bearing banners asking for peace,\n\n00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:30.729\nthe other half was actually marching\n\n00:01:30.729 --> 00:01:33.820\nin support of the criminal organization\n\n00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:37.004\nand its now-presumed-defunct leader.\n\n00:01:37.004 --> 00:01:40.073\nShocked, the mayor decided to step aside\n\n00:01:40.073 --> 00:01:42.084\nrather than participate or lead a procession\n\n00:01:42.084 --> 00:01:45.469\nthat was ostensibly in support of organized crime.\n\n00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:47.711\nAnd so his team stepped aside.\n\n00:01:47.711 --> 00:01:49.787\nThe two marches joined together,\n\n00:01:49.787 --> 00:01:52.792\nand they continued their path\n\n00:01:52.792 --> 00:01:55.402\ntowards the state capital.\n\n00:01:55.402 --> 00:02:00.213\nThis story of horrific violence\n\n00:02:00.213 --> 00:02:02.410\nfollowed by a fumbled approach\n\n00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:04.605\nby federal and local authorities as they tried\n\n00:02:04.605 --> 00:02:06.028\nto engage civil society,\n\n00:02:06.028 --> 00:02:09.384\nwho has been very well engaged by a criminal organization,\n\n00:02:09.384 --> 00:02:12.848\nis a perfect metaphor for what's happening in Mexico today,\n\n00:02:12.848 --> 00:02:16.197\nwhere we see that our current understanding\n\n00:02:16.197 --> 00:02:18.565\nof drug violence and what leads to it\n\n00:02:18.565 --> 00:02:21.167\nis probably at the very least incomplete.\n\n00:02:21.167 --> 00:02:23.170\nIf you decided to spend 30 minutes trying\n\n00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:25.200\nto figure out what's going on with drug violence in Mexico\n\n00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:27.839\nby, say, just researching online,\n\n00:02:27.839 --> 00:02:29.680\nthe first thing you would find out is that\n\n00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:33.647\nwhile the laws state that all Mexican citizens are equal,\n\n00:02:33.647 --> 00:02:34.766\nthere are some that are more\n\n00:02:34.766 --> 00:02:38.125\nand there are some that are much less equal than others,\n\n00:02:38.125 --> 00:02:39.376\nbecause you will quickly find out\n\n00:02:39.376 --> 00:02:41.080\nthat in the past six years\n\n00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:43.228\nanywhere between 60 and 100,000 people\n\n00:02:43.228 --> 00:02:46.786\nhave lost their lives in drug-related violence.\n\n00:02:46.786 --> 00:02:48.533\nTo put these numbers in perspective,\n\n00:02:48.533 --> 00:02:51.349\nthis is eight times larger than the number of casualties\n\n00:02:51.349 --> 00:02:55.870\nin the Iraq and Afghanistan wars combined.\n\n00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:58.374\nIt's also shockingly close to the number of people\n\n00:02:58.374 --> 00:03:00.900\nwho have died in the Syrian civil war,\n\n00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:03.113\nwhich is an active civil war.\n\n00:03:03.113 --> 00:03:06.309\nThis is happening just south of the border.\n\n00:03:06.309 --> 00:03:07.913\nNow as you're reading, however,\n\n00:03:07.913 --> 00:03:09.596\nyou will be maybe surprised that you will quickly\n\n00:03:09.596 --> 00:03:11.632\nbecome numb to the numbers of deaths,\n\n00:03:11.632 --> 00:03:15.318\nbecause you will see that these are sort of abstract numbers\n\n00:03:15.318 --> 00:03:18.911\nof faceless, nameless dead people.\n\n00:03:18.911 --> 00:03:21.635\nImplicitly or explicitly, there is a narrative\n\n00:03:21.635 --> 00:03:23.470\nthat all the people who are dying\n\n00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:26.326\nwere somehow involved in the drug trade,\n\n00:03:26.326 --> 00:03:29.922\nand we infer this because they were either tortured\n\n00:03:29.922 --> 00:03:32.083\nor executed in a professional manner,\n\n00:03:32.083 --> 00:03:33.735\nor, most likely, both.\n\n00:03:33.735 --> 00:03:35.716\nAnd so clearly they were criminals\n\n00:03:35.716 --> 00:03:38.331\nbecause of the way they died.\n\n00:03:38.331 --> 00:03:40.894\nAnd so the narrative is that somehow these people\n\n00:03:40.894 --> 00:03:42.137\ngot what they were deserved.\n\n00:03:42.137 --> 00:03:44.588\nThey were part of the bad guys.\n\n00:03:44.588 --> 00:03:47.136\nAnd that creates some form of comfort\n\n00:03:47.136 --> 00:03:48.768\nfor a lot of people.\n\n00:03:48.768 --> 00:03:51.732\nHowever, while it's easier to think\n\n00:03:51.732 --> 00:03:55.717\nof us, the citizens, the police, the army,\n\n00:03:55.717 --> 00:03:59.289\nas the good guys, and them, the narcos,\n\n00:03:59.289 --> 00:04:02.583\nthe carteles, as the bad guys,\n\n00:04:02.583 --> 00:04:03.749\nif you think about it,\n\n00:04:03.749 --> 00:04:07.557\nthe latter are only providing a service to the former.\n\n00:04:07.557 --> 00:04:09.672\nWhether we like it or not,\n\n00:04:09.672 --> 00:04:12.333\nthe U.S. is the largest market\n\n00:04:12.333 --> 00:04:13.951\nfor illegal substances in the world,\n\n00:04:13.951 --> 00:04:17.005\naccounting for more than half of global demand.\n\n00:04:17.005 --> 00:04:20.265\nIt shares thousands of miles of border with Mexico\n\n00:04:20.265 --> 00:04:23.383\nthat is its only route of access from the South,\n\n00:04:23.383 --> 00:04:26.438\nand so, as the former dictator of Mexico, Porfirio Diaz,\n\n00:04:26.438 --> 00:04:29.167\nused to say, \"Poor Mexico,\n\n00:04:29.167 --> 00:04:35.359\nso far from God and so close to the United States.\"\n\n00:04:35.359 --> 00:04:38.208\nThe U.N. estimates that there are 55 million users\n\n00:04:38.208 --> 00:04:40.675\nof illegal drugs in the United States.\n\n00:04:40.675 --> 00:04:43.101\nUsing very, very conservative assumptions,\n\n00:04:43.101 --> 00:04:46.198\nthis yields a yearly drug market on the retail side\n\n00:04:46.198 --> 00:04:48.981\nof anywhere between 30 and 150 billion dollars.\n\n00:04:48.981 --> 00:04:51.650\nIf we assume that the narcos only have access\n\n00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:54.374\nto the wholesale part, which we know is false,\n\n00:04:54.374 --> 00:04:56.715\nthat still leaves you with yearly revenues\n\n00:04:56.715 --> 00:05:01.233\nof anywhere between 15 billion and 60 billion dollars.\n\n00:05:01.233 --> 00:05:03.149\nTo put these numbers in perspective,\n\n00:05:03.149 --> 00:05:07.942\nMicrosoft has yearly revenues of 60 billion dollars.\n\n00:05:07.942 --> 00:05:10.448\nAnd it so happens that this is a product that,\n\n00:05:10.448 --> 00:05:13.423\nbecause of its nature, a business model\n\n00:05:13.423 --> 00:05:16.177\nto address this market requires you\n\n00:05:16.177 --> 00:05:18.306\nto guarantee to your producers\n\n00:05:18.306 --> 00:05:20.924\nthat their product will be reliably placed\n\n00:05:20.924 --> 00:05:23.041\nin the markets where it is consumed.\n\n00:05:23.041 --> 00:05:26.598\nAnd the only way to do this, because it's illegal,\n\n00:05:26.598 --> 00:05:29.608\nis to have absolute control of the geographic corridors\n\n00:05:29.608 --> 00:05:31.907\nthat are used to transport drugs.\n\n00:05:31.907 --> 00:05:34.424\nHence the violence.\n\n00:05:34.424 --> 00:05:37.456\nIf you look at a map of cartel influence and violence,\n\n00:05:37.456 --> 00:05:39.576\nyou will see that it almost perfectly aligns\n\n00:05:39.576 --> 00:05:41.360\nwith the most efficient routes of transportation\n\n00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:43.255\nfrom the south to the north.\n\n00:05:43.255 --> 00:05:44.411\nThe only thing that the cartels are doing\n\n00:05:44.411 --> 00:05:47.162\nis that they're trying to protect their business.\n\n00:05:47.162 --> 00:05:49.587\nIt's not only a multi-billion dollar market,\n\n00:05:49.587 --> 00:05:51.682\nbut it's also a complex one.\n\n00:05:51.682 --> 00:05:54.391\nFor example, the coca plant is a fragile plant\n\n00:05:54.406 --> 00:05:56.722\nthat can only grow in certain latitudes,\n\n00:05:56.722 --> 00:05:58.458\nand so it means that a business model\n\n00:05:58.458 --> 00:06:00.193\nto address this market requires you to have\n\n00:06:00.193 --> 00:06:02.714\ndecentralized, international production,\n\n00:06:02.714 --> 00:06:05.258\nthat by the way needs to have good quality control,\n\n00:06:05.258 --> 00:06:07.759\nbecause people need a good high\n\n00:06:07.759 --> 00:06:09.344\nthat is not going to kill them\n\n00:06:09.344 --> 00:06:12.206\nand that is going to be delivered to them when they need it.\n\n00:06:12.206 --> 00:06:14.199\nAnd so that means they need to secure\n\n00:06:14.199 --> 00:06:17.101\nproduction and quality control in the south,\n\n00:06:17.101 --> 00:06:19.108\nand you need to ensure that you have\n\n00:06:19.108 --> 00:06:21.600\nefficient and effective distribution channels\n\n00:06:21.600 --> 00:06:25.039\nin the markets where these drugs are consumed.\n\n00:06:25.039 --> 00:06:26.630\nI urge you, but only a little bit,\n\n00:06:26.630 --> 00:06:28.841\nbecause I don't want to get you in trouble,\n\n00:06:28.841 --> 00:06:32.127\nto just ask around and see how difficult it would be\n\n00:06:32.127 --> 00:06:34.984\nto get whatever drug you want, wherever you want it,\n\n00:06:34.984 --> 00:06:37.929\nwhenever you want it, anywhere in the U.S.,\n\n00:06:37.929 --> 00:06:40.742\nand some of you may be surprised to know\n\n00:06:40.742 --> 00:06:42.756\nthat there are many dealers that offer a service\n\n00:06:42.756 --> 00:06:44.580\nwhere if you send them a text message,\n\n00:06:44.580 --> 00:06:46.285\nthey guarantee delivery of the drug\n\n00:06:46.285 --> 00:06:49.167\nin 30 minutes or less.\n\n00:06:49.167 --> 00:06:51.588\nThink about this for a second.\n\n00:06:51.588 --> 00:06:53.319\nThink about the complexity\n\n00:06:53.319 --> 00:06:56.719\nof the distribution network that I just described.\n\n00:06:56.719 --> 00:06:59.217\nIt's very difficult to reconcile this\n\n00:06:59.217 --> 00:07:03.339\nwith the image of faceless, ignorant goons\n\n00:07:03.339 --> 00:07:05.944\nthat are just shooting each other,\n\n00:07:05.944 --> 00:07:07.632\nvery difficult to reconcile.\n\n00:07:07.632 --> 00:07:10.961\nNow, as a business professor, and as any business professor would tell you,\n\n00:07:10.961 --> 00:07:13.636\nan effective organization requires\n\n00:07:13.636 --> 00:07:15.545\nan integrated strategy that includes\n\n00:07:15.545 --> 00:07:18.418\na good organizational structure, good incentives,\n\n00:07:18.418 --> 00:07:21.410\na solid identity and good brand management.\n\n00:07:21.410 --> 00:07:23.545\nThis leads me to the second thing that you would learn\n\n00:07:23.545 --> 00:07:26.445\nin your 30-minute exploration of drug violence in Mexico.\n\n00:07:26.445 --> 00:07:28.007\nBecause you would quickly realize,\n\n00:07:28.007 --> 00:07:29.670\nand maybe be confused by the fact,\n\n00:07:29.670 --> 00:07:30.907\nthat there are three organizations\n\n00:07:30.907 --> 00:07:34.442\nthat are constantly named in the articles.\n\n00:07:34.442 --> 00:07:36.516\nYou will hear about Los Zetas,\n\n00:07:36.516 --> 00:07:38.487\nthe Knights Templar, which is the new brand\n\n00:07:38.487 --> 00:07:41.345\nfor the Familia Michoacana that I spoke about at the beginning,\n\n00:07:41.345 --> 00:07:43.719\nand the Sinaloa Federation.\n\n00:07:43.719 --> 00:07:46.510\nYou will read that Los Zetas is this assortment\n\n00:07:46.510 --> 00:07:50.865\nof sociopaths that terrify the cities that they enter\n\n00:07:50.865 --> 00:07:52.991\nand they silence the press,\n\n00:07:52.991 --> 00:07:56.365\nand this is somewhat true, or mostly true.\n\n00:07:56.365 --> 00:08:00.444\nBut this is the result of a very careful branding\n\n00:08:00.444 --> 00:08:02.245\nand business strategy.\n\n00:08:02.245 --> 00:08:04.414\nYou see, Los Zetas is not just\n\n00:08:04.414 --> 00:08:06.214\nthis random assortment of individuals,\n\n00:08:06.214 --> 00:08:09.869\nbut was actually created by another criminal organization, the Gulf Cartel,\n\n00:08:09.869 --> 00:08:12.881\nthat used to control the eastern corridor of Mexico.\n\n00:08:12.881 --> 00:08:15.295\nWhen that corridor became contested, they decided\n\n00:08:15.295 --> 00:08:17.085\nthat they wanted to recruit\n\n00:08:17.085 --> 00:08:19.916\na professional enforcement arm.\n\n00:08:19.916 --> 00:08:23.525\nSo they recruited Los Zetas:\n\n00:08:23.525 --> 00:08:26.283\nan entire unit of elite paratroopers\n\n00:08:26.283 --> 00:08:29.300\nfrom the Mexican Army.\n\n00:08:29.300 --> 00:08:33.006\nThey were incredibly effective as enforcers for the Gulf Cartel,\n\n00:08:33.006 --> 00:08:34.894\nso much so that at some point, they decided\n\n00:08:34.894 --> 00:08:37.387\nto just take over the operations,\n\n00:08:37.387 --> 00:08:41.181\nwhich is why I ask you to never keep tigers as pets,\n\n00:08:41.181 --> 00:08:43.822\nbecause they grow up.\n\n00:08:43.822 --> 00:08:47.518\nBecause the Zetas organization was founded in treason,\n\n00:08:47.518 --> 00:08:50.454\nthey lost some of the linkages to the production and distribution\n\n00:08:50.454 --> 00:08:52.661\nin the most profitable markets like cocaine,\n\n00:08:52.661 --> 00:08:53.951\nbut what they did have,\n\n00:08:53.951 --> 00:08:56.411\nand this is again based on their military origin,\n\n00:08:56.411 --> 00:08:59.258\nwas a perfectly structured chain of command\n\n00:08:59.258 --> 00:09:01.883\nwith a very clear hierarchy\n\n00:09:01.883 --> 00:09:05.947\nand a very clear promotion path that allowed them\n\n00:09:05.947 --> 00:09:09.769\nto supervise and operate across many, many markets\n\n00:09:09.769 --> 00:09:11.411\nvery effectively,\n\n00:09:11.411 --> 00:09:15.210\nwhich is the essence of what a chain of command seeks to do.\n\n00:09:15.210 --> 00:09:16.499\nAnd so because they didn't have access\n\n00:09:16.499 --> 00:09:18.834\nto the more profitable drug markets,\n\n00:09:18.834 --> 00:09:20.507\nthis pushed them and gave them the opportunity\n\n00:09:20.507 --> 00:09:24.005\nto diversify into other forms of crime.\n\n00:09:24.005 --> 00:09:28.060\nThat includes kidnapping, prostitution,\n\n00:09:28.060 --> 00:09:30.241\nlocal drug dealing and human trafficking,\n\n00:09:30.241 --> 00:09:34.197\nincluding of migrants that go from the south to the U.S.\n\n00:09:34.197 --> 00:09:38.445\nSo what they currently run is truly\n\n00:09:38.445 --> 00:09:42.017\nand quite literally a franchise business.\n\n00:09:42.017 --> 00:09:45.848\nThey focus most of their recruiting on the army,\n\n00:09:45.848 --> 00:09:48.925\nand they very openly advertise for better salaries,\n\n00:09:48.925 --> 00:09:51.623\nbetter benefits, better promotion paths,\n\n00:09:51.623 --> 00:09:53.271\nnot to mention much better food,\n\n00:09:53.271 --> 00:09:55.978\nthan what the army can deliver.\n\n00:09:55.978 --> 00:09:57.847\nThe way they operate is that\n\n00:09:57.847 --> 00:09:59.752\nwhen they arrive in a locality,\n\n00:09:59.752 --> 00:10:01.503\nthey let people know that they are there,\n\n00:10:01.503 --> 00:10:04.573\nand they go to the most powerful local gang\n\n00:10:04.573 --> 00:10:06.813\nand they say, \"I offer you\n\n00:10:06.813 --> 00:10:10.002\nto be the local representative of the Zeta brand.\"\n\n00:10:10.002 --> 00:10:11.875\nIf they agree -- and you don't want to know\n\n00:10:11.875 --> 00:10:13.618\nwhat happens if they don't --\n\n00:10:13.618 --> 00:10:15.305\nthey train them and they supervise them\n\n00:10:15.305 --> 00:10:18.632\non how to run the most efficient criminal operation\n\n00:10:18.632 --> 00:10:22.133\nfor that town, in exchange for royalties.\n\n00:10:22.133 --> 00:10:24.039\nThis kind of business model obviously depends\n\n00:10:24.039 --> 00:10:26.436\nentirely on having a very effective brand of fear,\n\n00:10:26.436 --> 00:10:28.809\nand so Los Zetas\n\n00:10:28.809 --> 00:10:31.102\ncarefully stage acts of violence\n\n00:10:31.102 --> 00:10:33.035\nthat are spectacular in nature,\n\n00:10:33.035 --> 00:10:35.835\nespecially when they arrive first in a city,\n\n00:10:35.835 --> 00:10:39.069\nbut again, that's just a brand strategy.\n\n00:10:39.069 --> 00:10:40.968\nI'm not saying they're not violent,\n\n00:10:40.968 --> 00:10:42.911\nbut what I am saying is that even though you will read\n\n00:10:42.911 --> 00:10:44.774\nthat they are the most violent of all,\n\n00:10:44.774 --> 00:10:47.737\nwhen you count, when you do the body count,\n\n00:10:47.737 --> 00:10:51.509\nthey're actually all the same.\n\n00:10:51.509 --> 00:10:54.597\nIn contrast to them, the Knights Templar\n\n00:10:54.597 --> 00:10:56.437\nthat arose in Michoac\u00e1n\n\n00:10:56.437 --> 00:10:59.044\nemerged in reaction to the incursion\n\n00:10:59.044 --> 00:11:01.579\nof the Zetas into the state of Michoac\u00e1n.\n\n00:11:01.579 --> 00:11:04.496\nMichoac\u00e1n is a geographically strategic state\n\n00:11:04.496 --> 00:11:06.499\nbecause it has one of the largest ports in Mexico,\n\n00:11:06.499 --> 00:11:09.090\nand it has very direct routes to the center of Mexico,\n\n00:11:09.090 --> 00:11:12.156\nwhich then gives you direct access to the U.S.\n\n00:11:12.156 --> 00:11:13.695\nThe Knights Templar realized very quickly\n\n00:11:13.695 --> 00:11:17.203\nthat they couldn't face the Zetas on violence alone,\n\n00:11:17.203 --> 00:11:19.560\nand so they developed a strategy\n\n00:11:19.560 --> 00:11:22.339\nas a social enterprise.\n\n00:11:22.339 --> 00:11:25.339\nThey brand themselves as representative of\n\n00:11:25.339 --> 00:11:27.995\nand protecting of the citizens of Michoac\u00e1n\n\n00:11:27.995 --> 00:11:30.293\nagainst organized crime.\n\n00:11:30.293 --> 00:11:32.024\nTheir brand of social enterprise means\n\n00:11:32.024 --> 00:11:34.075\nthat they require a lot of civic engagement,\n\n00:11:34.075 --> 00:11:38.241\nso they invest heavily in providing local services,\n\n00:11:38.241 --> 00:11:41.739\nlike dealing with home violence,\n\n00:11:41.739 --> 00:11:45.515\ngoing after petty criminals, treating addicts,\n\n00:11:45.515 --> 00:11:48.293\nand keeping drugs out of the local markets\n\n00:11:48.293 --> 00:11:50.773\nwhere they are,\n\n00:11:50.773 --> 00:11:52.392\nand, of course, protecting people\n\n00:11:52.392 --> 00:11:54.883\nfrom other criminal organizations.\n\n00:11:54.883 --> 00:11:57.914\nNow, they kill a lot of people too,\n\n00:11:57.914 --> 00:12:00.011\nbut when they kill them,\n\n00:12:00.026 --> 00:12:02.926\nthey provide very careful narratives and descriptions\n\n00:12:02.926 --> 00:12:04.178\nfor why they did them,\n\n00:12:04.178 --> 00:12:08.141\nthrough newspaper insertions, YouTube videos,\n\n00:12:08.141 --> 00:12:10.607\nand billboards that explain that the people who were killed\n\n00:12:10.607 --> 00:12:12.935\nwere killed because they represented a threat\n\n00:12:12.935 --> 00:12:14.791\nnot to us, as an organization, of course,\n\n00:12:14.791 --> 00:12:16.727\nbut to you, as citizens.\n\n00:12:16.727 --> 00:12:19.183\nAnd so we're actually here to protect you.\n\n00:12:19.183 --> 00:12:21.747\nThey, as social enterprises do,\n\n00:12:21.747 --> 00:12:23.247\nhave created a moral and ethical code\n\n00:12:23.247 --> 00:12:25.616\nthat they advertise around,\n\n00:12:25.616 --> 00:12:28.754\nand they have very strict recruiting practices.\n\n00:12:28.754 --> 00:12:30.577\nAnd here you have the types of explanations\n\n00:12:30.577 --> 00:12:34.518\nthat they provide for some of their actions.\n\n00:12:34.518 --> 00:12:36.414\nThey have actually retained access\n\n00:12:36.414 --> 00:12:38.714\nto the profitable drug trade,\n\n00:12:38.714 --> 00:12:40.924\nbut the way they do it is, because they control all of Michoac\u00e1n,\n\n00:12:40.924 --> 00:12:43.067\nand they control the Port of L\u00e1zaro C\u00e1rdenas,\n\n00:12:43.067 --> 00:12:44.869\nthey leverage that to, for example,\n\n00:12:44.869 --> 00:12:48.426\ntrade copper from Michoac\u00e1n that is legally created\n\n00:12:48.426 --> 00:12:49.826\nand legally extracted\n\n00:12:49.826 --> 00:12:51.828\nwith illegal ephedrine from China\n\n00:12:51.828 --> 00:12:55.252\nwhich is a critical precursor for methamphetamines\n\n00:12:55.252 --> 00:12:57.652\nthat they produce, and then they have partnerships\n\n00:12:57.652 --> 00:13:00.190\nwith larger organizations like the Sinaloa Federation\n\n00:13:00.190 --> 00:13:02.880\nthat place their products in the U.S.\n\n00:13:02.880 --> 00:13:05.551\nFinally, the Sinaloa Federation.\n\n00:13:05.551 --> 00:13:07.749\nWhen you read about them, you will often read about them\n\n00:13:07.749 --> 00:13:11.449\nwith an undertone of reverence and admiration,\n\n00:13:11.449 --> 00:13:13.365\nbecause they are the most integrated\n\n00:13:13.365 --> 00:13:15.653\nand the largest of all the Mexican organizations,\n\n00:13:15.653 --> 00:13:19.107\nand, many people argue, the world.\n\n00:13:19.107 --> 00:13:22.091\nThey started as just sort of a transport organization\n\n00:13:22.091 --> 00:13:24.165\nthat specialized in smuggling between the U.S.\n\n00:13:24.165 --> 00:13:26.290\nand the Mexican borders,\n\n00:13:26.290 --> 00:13:27.708\nbut now they have grown\n\n00:13:27.708 --> 00:13:31.134\ninto a truly integrated multinational\n\n00:13:31.134 --> 00:13:33.440\nthat has partnerships in production in the south\n\n00:13:33.440 --> 00:13:36.453\nand partnerships in global distribution\n\n00:13:36.453 --> 00:13:38.947\nacross the planet.\n\n00:13:38.947 --> 00:13:42.277\nThey have cultivated a brand of professionalism,\n\n00:13:42.277 --> 00:13:45.595\nbusiness acumen and innovation.\n\n00:13:45.595 --> 00:13:47.694\nThey have designed new drug products\n\n00:13:47.694 --> 00:13:49.417\nand new drug processes.\n\n00:13:49.417 --> 00:13:51.635\nThey have designed narco-tunnels\n\n00:13:51.635 --> 00:13:53.176\nthat go across the border,\n\n00:13:53.176 --> 00:13:54.991\nand you can see that these are not\n\n00:13:54.991 --> 00:13:58.939\n\"The Shawshank Redemption\" types.\n\n00:13:58.939 --> 00:14:02.635\nThey have invented narco-submarines and boats\n\n00:14:02.635 --> 00:14:05.318\nthat are not detected by radar.\n\n00:14:05.318 --> 00:14:07.881\nThey have invented drones to transport drugs,\n\n00:14:07.881 --> 00:14:11.167\ncatapults, you name it.\n\n00:14:11.167 --> 00:14:13.508\nOne of the leaders of the Sinaloa Federation\n\n00:14:13.508 --> 00:14:15.946\nactually made it to the Forbes list.\n\n00:14:15.946 --> 00:14:17.919\n[#701 Joaquin Guzman Loera]\n\n00:14:17.919 --> 00:14:20.824\nLike any multinational would, they have specialized\n\n00:14:20.824 --> 00:14:23.113\nand focused only in the most profitable part of the business,\n\n00:14:23.113 --> 00:14:25.791\nwhich is high-margin drugs like cocaine,\n\n00:14:25.791 --> 00:14:28.076\nheroine, methamphetamines.\n\n00:14:28.076 --> 00:14:30.649\nLike any traditional Latin American multinational would,\n\n00:14:30.649 --> 00:14:32.390\nthe way they control their operations\n\n00:14:32.390 --> 00:14:34.172\nis through family ties.\n\n00:14:34.172 --> 00:14:36.117\nWhen they're entering a new market, they send\n\n00:14:36.117 --> 00:14:37.838\na family member to supervise it,\n\n00:14:37.838 --> 00:14:40.655\nor, if they're partnering with a new organization,\n\n00:14:40.655 --> 00:14:42.075\nthey create a family tie,\n\n00:14:42.075 --> 00:14:46.541\neither through marriages or other types of ties.\n\n00:14:46.541 --> 00:14:48.704\nLike any other multinational would,\n\n00:14:48.704 --> 00:14:51.871\nthey protect their brand by outsourcing\n\n00:14:51.871 --> 00:14:54.039\nthe more questionable parts of the business model,\n\n00:14:54.039 --> 00:14:56.082\nlike for example, when they have to engage\n\n00:14:56.082 --> 00:14:58.847\nin violence against other criminal organizations,\n\n00:14:58.847 --> 00:15:02.292\nthey recruit gangs and other smaller players\n\n00:15:02.292 --> 00:15:04.091\nto do the dirty work for them,\n\n00:15:04.091 --> 00:15:05.876\nand they try to separate their operations\n\n00:15:05.876 --> 00:15:09.511\nand their violence and be very discrete about this.\n\n00:15:09.511 --> 00:15:12.007\nTo further strengthen their brand,\n\n00:15:12.007 --> 00:15:14.900\nthey actually have professional P.R. firms\n\n00:15:14.900 --> 00:15:17.379\nthat shape how the press talks about them.\n\n00:15:17.379 --> 00:15:20.930\nThey have professional videographers on staff.\n\n00:15:20.930 --> 00:15:23.043\nThey have incredibly productive ties\n\n00:15:23.043 --> 00:15:24.876\nwith the security organizations\n\n00:15:24.876 --> 00:15:28.288\non both sides of the border.\n\n00:15:28.288 --> 00:15:30.889\nAnd so, differences aside,\n\n00:15:30.889 --> 00:15:34.444\nwhat these three organizations share\n\n00:15:34.444 --> 00:15:38.084\nis on the one hand, a very clear understanding\n\n00:15:38.084 --> 00:15:41.168\nthat institutions cannot be imposed from the top,\n\n00:15:41.168 --> 00:15:44.108\nbut rather they are built from the bottom up\n\n00:15:44.108 --> 00:15:47.391\none interaction at a time.\n\n00:15:47.391 --> 00:15:49.812\nThey have created extremely coherent structures\n\n00:15:49.812 --> 00:15:52.646\nthat they use to show the inconsistencies\n\n00:15:52.646 --> 00:15:56.673\nin government policies.\n\n00:15:56.673 --> 00:15:59.160\nAnd so what I want you to remember from this talk\n\n00:15:59.160 --> 00:16:00.693\nare three things.\n\n00:16:00.693 --> 00:16:03.749\nThe first one is that drug violence\n\n00:16:03.749 --> 00:16:05.626\nis actually the result\n\n00:16:05.626 --> 00:16:08.877\nof a huge market demand\n\n00:16:08.877 --> 00:16:12.527\nand an institutional setup that forces\n\n00:16:12.527 --> 00:16:15.653\nthe servicing of this market to necessitate violence\n\n00:16:15.653 --> 00:16:19.698\nto guarantee delivery routes.\n\n00:16:19.698 --> 00:16:21.624\nThe second thing I want you to remember\n\n00:16:21.624 --> 00:16:23.570\nis that these are sophisticated,\n\n00:16:23.570 --> 00:16:26.493\ncoherent organizations\n\n00:16:26.493 --> 00:16:28.451\nthat are business organizations,\n\n00:16:28.451 --> 00:16:30.370\nand analyzing them and treating them as such\n\n00:16:30.370 --> 00:16:33.759\nis probably a much more useful approach.\n\n00:16:33.759 --> 00:16:35.895\nThe third thing I want you to remember\n\n00:16:35.895 --> 00:16:37.323\nis that even though we're more comfortable\n\n00:16:37.323 --> 00:16:39.846\nwith this idea of \"them,\"\n\n00:16:39.846 --> 00:16:42.587\na set of bad guys separated from us,\n\n00:16:42.587 --> 00:16:45.564\nwe are actually accomplices to them,\n\n00:16:45.564 --> 00:16:47.953\neither through our direct consumption\n\n00:16:47.953 --> 00:16:52.025\nor through our acceptance of the inconsistency\n\n00:16:52.025 --> 00:16:54.293\nbetween our policies of prohibition\n\n00:16:54.293 --> 00:16:57.241\nand our actual behavior of tolerance\n\n00:16:57.241 --> 00:17:01.465\nor even encouragement of consumption.\n\n00:17:01.465 --> 00:17:05.485\nThese organizations service, recruit from,\n\n00:17:05.485 --> 00:17:07.813\nand operate within our communities,\n\n00:17:07.813 --> 00:17:10.231\nso necessarily, they are much more integrated\n\n00:17:10.231 --> 00:17:14.701\nwithin them than we are comfortable acknowledging.\n\n00:17:14.701 --> 00:17:17.566\nAnd so to me the question is not whether\n\n00:17:17.566 --> 00:17:20.847\nthese dynamics will continue the way they have.\n\n00:17:20.847 --> 00:17:23.612\nWe see that the nature of this phenomenon\n\n00:17:23.612 --> 00:17:26.080\nguarantees that they will.\n\n00:17:26.080 --> 00:17:28.960\nThe question is whether we are willing to continue\n\n00:17:28.960 --> 00:17:33.566\nour support of a failed strategy\n\n00:17:33.566 --> 00:17:39.073\nbased on our stubborn, blissful, voluntary ignorance\n\n00:17:39.073 --> 00:17:44.034\nat the cost of the deaths of thousands of our young.\n\n00:17:44.034 --> 00:17:45.765\nThank you.\n\n00:17:45.765 --> 00:17:50.927\n(Applause)"}, {"title": "What I discovered in New York City  trash", "duration": "472", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/robin_nagle_what_i_discovered_in_new_york_city_trash", "transcript": "I was about 10 years old on a camping trip with my dad in the Adirondack Mountains, a wilderness area in the northern part of New York State. It was a beautiful day. The forest was sparkling. The sun made the leaves glow like stained glass, and if it weren't for the path we were following, we could almost pretend we were the first human beings to ever walk that land.We got to our campsite. It was a lean-to on a bluff looking over a crystal, beautiful lake, when I discovered a horror. Behind the lean-to was a dump, maybe 40 feet square with rotting apple cores and balled-up aluminum foil, and a dead sneaker. And I was astonished, I was very angry, and I was deeply confused. The campers who were too lazy to take out what they had brought in, who did they think would clean up after them?That question stayed with me, and it simplified a little. Who cleans up after us? However you configure or wherever you place the us, who cleans up after us in Istanbul? Who cleans up after us in Rio or in Paris or in London? Here in New York, the Department of Sanitation cleans up after us, to the tune of 11,000 tons of garbage and 2,000 tons of recyclables every day. I wanted to get to know them as individuals. I wanted to understand who takes the job. What's it like to wear the uniform and bear that burden?So I started a research project with them. I rode in the trucks and walked the routes and interviewed people in offices and facilities all over the city, and I learned a lot, but I was still an outsider. I needed to go deeper.So I took the job as a sanitation worker. I didn't just ride in the trucks now. I drove the trucks. And I operated the mechanical brooms and I plowed the snow. It was a remarkable privilege and an amazing education.Everyone asks about the smell. It's there, but it's not as prevalent as you think, and on days when it is really bad, you get used to it rather quickly. The weight takes a long time to get used to. I knew people who were several years on the job whose bodies were still adjusting to the burden of bearing on your body tons of trash every week.Then there's the danger. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, sanitation work is one of the 10 most dangerous occupations in the country, and I learned why. You're in and out of traffic all day, and it's zooming around you. It just wants to get past you, so it's often the motorist is not paying attention. That's really bad for the worker. And then the garbage itself is full of hazards that often fly back out of the truck and do terrible harm.I also learned about the relentlessness of trash. When you step off the curb and you see a city from behind a truck, you come to understand that trash is like a force of nature unto itself. It never stops coming. It's also like a form of respiration or circulation. It must always be in motion.And then there's the stigma. You put on the uniform, and you become invisible until someone is upset with you for whatever reason like you've blocked traffic with your truck, or you're taking a break too close to their home, or you're drinking coffee in their diner, and they will come and scorn you, and tell you that they don't want you anywhere near them. I find the stigma especially ironic, because I strongly believe that sanitation workers are the most important labor force on the streets of the city, for three reasons. They are the first guardians of public health. If they're not taking away trash efficiently and effectively every day, it starts to spill out of its containments, and the dangers inherent to it threaten us in very real ways. Diseases we've had in check for decades and centuries burst forth again and start to harm us. The economy needs them. If we can't throw out the old stuff, we have no room for the new stuff, so then the engines of the economy start to sputter when consumption is compromised. I'm not advocating capitalism, I'm just pointing out their relationship. And then there's what I call our average, necessary quotidian velocity. By that I simply mean how fast we're used to moving in the contemporary day and age. We usually don't care for, repair, clean, carry around our coffee cup, our shopping bag, our bottle of water. We use them, we throw them out, we forget about them, because we know there's a workforce on the other side that's going to take it all away.So I want to suggest today a couple of ways to think about sanitation that will perhaps help ameliorate the stigma and bring them into this conversation of how to craft a city that is sustainable and humane. Their work, I think, is kind of liturgical. They're on the streets every day, rhythmically. They wear a uniform in many cities. You know when to expect them. And their work lets us do our work. They are almost a form of reassurance. The flow that they maintain keeps us safe from ourselves, from our own dross, our cast-offs, and that flow must be maintained always no matter what.On the day after September 11 in 2001, I heard the growl of a sanitation truck on the street, and I grabbed my infant son and I ran downstairs and there was a man doing his paper recycling route like he did every Wednesday. And I tried to thank him for doing his work on that day of all days, but I started to cry. And he looked at me, and he just nodded, and he said, \"We're going to be okay. We're going to be okay.\" It was a little while later that I started my research with sanitation, and I met that man again. His name is Paulie, and we worked together many times, and we became good friends.I want to believe that Paulie was right. We are going to be okay. But in our effort to reconfigure how we as a species exist on this planet, we must include and take account of all the costs, including the very real human cost of the labor. And we also would be well informed to reach out to the people who do that work and get their expertise on how do we think about, how do we create systems around sustainability that perhaps take us from curbside recycling, which is a remarkable success across 40 years, across the United States and countries around the world, and lift us up to a broader horizon where we're looking at other forms of waste that could be lessened from manufacturing and industrial sources. Municipal waste, what we think of when we talk about garbage, accounts for three percent of the nation's waste stream. It's a remarkable statistic.So in the flow of your days, in the flow of your lives, next time you see someone whose job is to clean up after you, take a moment to acknowledge them. Take a moment to say thank you.(Applause)", "id": 1858, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:12.273 --> 00:00:14.530\nI was about 10 years old\n\n00:00:14.530 --> 00:00:16.229\non a camping trip with my dad\n\n00:00:16.229 --> 00:00:18.989\nin the Adirondack Mountains, a wilderness area\n\n00:00:18.989 --> 00:00:21.984\nin the northern part of New York State.\n\n00:00:21.984 --> 00:00:23.425\nIt was a beautiful day.\n\n00:00:23.425 --> 00:00:25.427\nThe forest was sparkling.\n\n00:00:25.427 --> 00:00:28.951\nThe sun made the leaves glow like stained glass,\n\n00:00:28.951 --> 00:00:32.156\nand if it weren't for the path we were following,\n\n00:00:32.156 --> 00:00:33.560\nwe could almost pretend we were\n\n00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:37.122\nthe first human beings to ever walk that land.\n\n00:00:37.122 --> 00:00:38.773\nWe got to our campsite.\n\n00:00:38.773 --> 00:00:40.740\nIt was a lean-to on a bluff\n\n00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:43.436\nlooking over a crystal, beautiful lake,\n\n00:00:43.436 --> 00:00:46.132\nwhen I discovered a horror.\n\n00:00:46.132 --> 00:00:49.230\nBehind the lean-to was a dump,\n\n00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:50.688\nmaybe 40 feet square\n\n00:00:50.688 --> 00:00:53.001\nwith rotting apple cores\n\n00:00:53.001 --> 00:00:54.748\nand balled-up aluminum foil,\n\n00:00:54.748 --> 00:00:56.497\nand a dead sneaker.\n\n00:00:56.497 --> 00:00:59.068\nAnd I was astonished,\n\n00:00:59.068 --> 00:01:02.500\nI was very angry, and I was deeply confused.\n\n00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:04.082\nThe campers who were too lazy\n\n00:01:04.082 --> 00:01:06.040\nto take out what they had brought in,\n\n00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:09.885\nwho did they think would clean up after them?\n\n00:01:09.885 --> 00:01:11.794\nThat question stayed with me,\n\n00:01:11.794 --> 00:01:13.761\nand it simplified a little.\n\n00:01:13.761 --> 00:01:16.137\nWho cleans up after us?\n\n00:01:16.137 --> 00:01:17.559\nHowever you configure\n\n00:01:17.559 --> 00:01:19.266\nor wherever you place the us,\n\n00:01:19.266 --> 00:01:21.856\nwho cleans up after us in Istanbul?\n\n00:01:21.856 --> 00:01:24.112\nWho cleans up after us in Rio\n\n00:01:24.112 --> 00:01:26.641\nor in Paris or in London?\n\n00:01:26.641 --> 00:01:28.213\nHere in New York,\n\n00:01:28.213 --> 00:01:30.805\nthe Department of Sanitation cleans up after us,\n\n00:01:30.805 --> 00:01:33.475\nto the tune of 11,000 tons of garbage\n\n00:01:33.475 --> 00:01:37.837\nand 2,000 tons of recyclables every day.\n\n00:01:37.837 --> 00:01:40.470\nI wanted to get to know them as individuals.\n\n00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:43.316\nI wanted to understand who takes the job.\n\n00:01:43.316 --> 00:01:45.835\nWhat's it like to wear the uniform\n\n00:01:45.835 --> 00:01:47.489\nand bear that burden?\n\n00:01:47.489 --> 00:01:50.142\nSo I started a research project with them.\n\n00:01:50.142 --> 00:01:52.681\nI rode in the trucks and walked the routes\n\n00:01:52.681 --> 00:01:55.090\nand interviewed people in offices and facilities\n\n00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:56.597\nall over the city,\n\n00:01:56.597 --> 00:01:58.336\nand I learned a lot,\n\n00:01:58.336 --> 00:02:00.685\nbut I was still an outsider.\n\n00:02:00.685 --> 00:02:02.563\nI needed to go deeper.\n\n00:02:02.563 --> 00:02:05.679\nSo I took the job as a sanitation worker.\n\n00:02:05.679 --> 00:02:08.326\nI didn't just ride in the trucks now.

00:05:00.314\non the other side that's going to take it all away.\n\n00:05:00.314 --> 00:05:02.761\nSo I want to suggest today a couple of ways\n\n00:05:02.761 --> 00:05:07.275\nto think about sanitation that will perhaps help\n\n00:05:07.275 --> 00:05:09.749\nameliorate the stigma\n\n00:05:09.749 --> 00:05:11.980\nand bring them into this conversation\n\n00:05:11.980 --> 00:05:17.570\nof how to craft a city that is sustainable and humane.\n\n00:05:17.570 --> 00:05:21.731\nTheir work, I think, is kind of liturgical.\n\n00:05:21.731 --> 00:05:24.192\nThey're on the streets every day, rhythmically.\n\n00:05:24.192 --> 00:05:26.253\nThey wear a uniform in many cities.\n\n00:05:26.253 --> 00:05:28.122\nYou know when to expect them.\n\n00:05:28.122 --> 00:05:32.045\nAnd their work lets us do our work.\n\n00:05:32.045 --> 00:05:34.836\nThey are almost a form of reassurance.\n\n00:05:34.836 --> 00:05:36.573\nThe flow that they maintain\n\n00:05:36.573 --> 00:05:38.563\nkeeps us safe from ourselves,\n\n00:05:38.563 --> 00:05:41.200\nfrom our own dross, our cast-offs,\n\n00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:44.458\nand that flow must be maintained always\n\n00:05:44.458 --> 00:05:46.091\nno matter what.\n\n00:05:46.091 --> 00:05:49.815\nOn the day after September 11 in 2001,\n\n00:05:49.815 --> 00:05:53.102\nI heard the growl of a sanitation truck on the street,\n\n00:05:53.102 --> 00:05:55.414\nand I grabbed my infant son and I ran downstairs\n\n00:05:55.414 --> 00:05:58.256\nand there was a man doing his paper recycling route\n\n00:05:58.256 --> 00:06:00.438\nlike he did every Wednesday.\n\n00:06:00.438 --> 00:06:02.858\nAnd I tried to thank him for doing his work\n\n00:06:02.858 --> 00:06:04.983\non that day of all days,\n\n00:06:04.983 --> 00:06:07.584\nbut I started to cry.\n\n00:06:07.584 --> 00:06:09.268\nAnd he looked at me,\n\n00:06:09.268 --> 00:06:12.692\nand he just nodded, and he said,\n\n00:06:12.692 --> 00:06:15.570\n\"We're going to be okay.\n\n00:06:15.570 --> 00:06:18.211\nWe're going to be okay.\"\n\n00:06:18.211 --> 00:06:19.564\nIt was a little while later that I started\n\n00:06:19.564 --> 00:06:20.944\nmy research with sanitation,\n\n00:06:20.944 --> 00:06:22.358\nand I met that man again.\n\n00:06:22.358 --> 00:06:25.275\nHis name is Paulie, and we worked together many times,\n\n00:06:25.275 --> 00:06:27.098\nand we became good friends.\n\n00:06:27.098 --> 00:06:29.925\nI want to believe that Paulie was right.\n\n00:06:29.925 --> 00:06:32.127\nWe are going to be okay.\n\n00:06:32.127 --> 00:06:34.104\nBut in

My lab at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology focuses on spinal cord injury, which affects more than 50,000 people around the world every year, with dramatic consequences for affected individuals, whose life literally shatters in a matter of a handful of seconds.And for me, the Man of Steel, Christopher Reeve, has best raised the awareness on the distress of spinal cord injured people. And this is how I started my own personal journey in this field of research, working with the Christopher and Dana Reeve Foundation.I still remember this decisive moment. It was just at the end of a regular day of work with the foundation. Chris addressed us, the scientists and experts, \"You have to be more pragmatic. When leaving your laboratory tomorrow, I want you to stop by the rehabilitation center to watch injured people fighting to take a step, struggling to maintain their trunk. And when you go home, think of what you are going to change in your research on the following day to make their lives better.\"These words, they stuck with me. This was more than 10 years ago, but ever since, my laboratory has followed the pragmatic approach to recovery after spinal cord injury. And my first step in this direction was to develop a new model of spinal cord injury that would more closely mimic some of the key features of human injury while offering well-controlled experimental conditions. And for this purpose, we placed two hemisections on opposite sides of the body. They completely interrupt the communication between the brain and the spinal cord, thus leading to complete and permanent paralysis of the leg. But, as observed, after most injuries in humans, there is this intervening gap of intact neural tissue through which recovery can occur. But how to make it happen?Well, the classical approach consists of applying intervention that would promote the growth of the severed fiber to the original target. And while this certainly remained the key for a cure, this seemed extraordinarily complicated to me. To reach clinical fruition rapidly, it was obvious: I had to think about the problem differently.It turned out that more than 100 years of research on spinal cord physiology, starting with the Nobel Prize Sherrington, had shown that the spinal cord, below most injuries, contained all the necessary and sufficient neural networks to coordinate locomotion, but because input from the brain is interrupted, they are in a nonfunctional state, like kind of dormant. My idea: We awaken this network.And at the time, I was a post-doctoral fellow in Los Angeles, after completing my Ph.D. in France, where independent thinking is not necessarily promoted. (Laughter) I was afraid to talk to my new boss, but decided to muster up my courage. I knocked at the door of my wonderful advisor, Reggie Edgerton, to share my new idea.He listened to me carefully, and responded with a grin. \"Why don't you try?\"And I promise to you, this was such an important moment in my career, when I realized that the great leader believed in young people and new ideas.And this was the idea: I'm going to use a simplistic metaphor to explain to you this complicated concept. Imagine that the locomotor system is a car. The engine is the spinal cord. The transmission is interrupted. The engine is turned off. How could we re-engage the engine? First, we have to provide the fuel; second, press the accelerator pedal; third, steer the car. It turned out that there are known neural pathways coming from the brain that play this very function during locomotion. My idea: Replace this missing input to provide the spinal cord with the kind of intervention that the brain would deliver naturally in order to walk.For this, I leveraged 20 years of past research in neuroscience, first to replace the missing fuel with pharmacological agents that prepare the neurons in the spinal cord to fire, and second, to mimic the accelerator pedal with electrical stimulation. So here imagine an electrode implanted on the back of the spinal cord to deliver painless stimulation. It took many years, but eventually we developed an electrochemical neuroprosthesis that transformed the neural network in the spinal cord from dormant to a highly functional state. Immediately, the paralyzed rat can stand. As soon as the treadmill belt starts moving, the animal shows coordinated movement of the leg, but without the brain. Here what I call \"the spinal brain\" cognitively processes sensory information arising from the moving leg and makes decisions as to how to activate the muscle in order to stand, to walk, to run, and even here, while sprinting, instantly stand if the treadmill stops moving.This was amazing. I was completely fascinated by this locomotion without the brain, but at the same time so frustrated. This locomotion was completely involuntary. The animal had virtually no control over the legs. Clearly, the steering system was missing. And it then became obvious from me that we had to move away from the classical rehabilitation paradigm, stepping on a treadmill, and develop conditions that would encourage the brain to begin voluntary control over the leg.With this in mind, we developed a completely new robotic system to support the rat in any direction of space. Imagine, this is really cool. So imagine the little 200-gram rat attached at the extremity of this 200-kilo robot, but the rat does not feel the robot. The robot is transparent, just like you would hold a young child during the first insecure steps.Let me summarize: The rat received a paralyzing lesion of the spinal cord. The electrochemical neuroprosthesis enabled a highly functional state of the spinal locomotor networks. The robot provided the safe environment to allow the rat to attempt anything to engage the paralyzed legs. And for motivation, we used what I think is the most powerful pharmacology of Switzerland: fine Swiss chocolate.(Laughter)Actually, the first results were very, very, very disappointing. Here is my best physical therapist completely failing to encourage the rat to take a single step, whereas the same rat, five minutes earlier, walked beautifully on the treadmill. We were so frustrated.But you know, one of the most essential qualities of a scientist is perseverance. We insisted. We refined our paradigm, and after several months of training, the otherwise paralyzed rat could stand, and whenever she decided, initiated full weight-bearing locomotion to sprint towards the rewards. This is the first recovery ever observed of voluntary leg movement after an experimental lesion of the spinal cord leading to complete and permanent paralysis.In fact \u2014(Applause)Thank you.In fact, not only could the rat initiate and sustain locomotion on the ground, they could even adjust leg movement, for example, to resist gravity in order to climb a staircase. I can promise you this was such an emotional moment in my laboratory. It took us 10 years of hard work to reach this goal.But the remaining question was, how? I mean, how is it possible? And here, what we found was completely unexpected. This novel training paradigm encouraged the brain to create new connections, some relay circuits that relay information from the brain past the injury and restore cortical control over the locomotor networks below the injury. And here, you can see one such example, where we label the fibers coming from the brain in red. This blue neuron is connected with the locomotor center, and what this constellation of synaptic contacts means is that the brain is reconnected with the locomotor center with only one relay neuron. But the remodeling was not restricted to the lesion area. It occurred throughout the central nervous system, including in the brain stem, where we observed up to 300-percent increase in the density of fibers coming from the brain. We did not aim to repair the spinal cord, yet we were able to promote one of the more extensive remodeling of axonal projections ever observed in the central nervous system of adult mammal after an injury.And there is a very important message hidden behind this discovery. They are the result of a young team of very talented people: physical therapists, neurobiologists, neurosurgeons, engineers of all kinds, who have achieved together what would have been impossible by single individuals. This is truly a trans-disciplinary team. They are working so close to each other that there is horizontal transfer of DNA. We are creating the next generation of M.D.'s and engineers capable of translating discoveries all the way from bench to bedside. And me? I am only the maestro who orchestrated this beautiful symphony.Now, I am sure you are all wondering, aren't you, will this help injured people? Me too, every day. The truth is that we don't know enough yet. This is certainly not a cure for spinal cord injury, but I begin to believe that this may lead to an intervention to improve recovery and people's quality of life.I would like you all to take a moment and dream with me. Imagine a person just suffered a spinal cord injury. After a few weeks of recovery, we will implant a programmable pump to deliver a personalized pharmacological cocktail directly to the spinal cord. At the same time, we will implant an electrode array, a sort of second skin covering the area of the spinal cord controlling leg movement, and this array is attached to an electrical pulse generator that delivers stimulations that are tailored to the person's needs. This defines a personalized electrochemical neuroprosthesis that will enable locomotion during training with a newly designed supporting system. And my hope is that after several months of training, there may be enough remodeling of residual connection to allow locomotion without the robot, maybe even without pharmacology or stimulation. My hope here is to be able to create the personalized condition to boost the plasticity of the brain and the spinal cord. And this is a radically new concept that may apply to other neurological disorders, what I termed \"personalized neuroprosthetics,\" where by sensing and stimulating neural interfaces, I implanted throughout the nervous system, in the brain, in the spinal cord, even in peripheral nerves, based on patient-specific impairments. But not to replace the lost function, no \u2014 to help the brain help itself.And I hope this enticed your imagination, because I can promise to you this is not a matter of whether this revolution will occur, but when. And remember, we are only as great as our imagination, as big as our dream.Thank you.(Applause)", "id": 1860, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:12.404 -->

don't you try?\"\n\n00:03:53.228 --> 00:03:55.353\nAnd I promise to you,\n\n00:03:55.353 --> 00:03:58.708\nthis was such an important moment in my career,\n\n00:03:58.708 --> 00:04:01.143\nwhen I realized that the great leader\n\n00:04:01.143 --> 00:04:04.136\nbelieved in young people and new ideas.\n\n00:04:04.136 --> 00:04:05.744\nAnd this was the idea:\n\n00:04:05.744 --> 00:04:08.410\nI'm going to use a simplistic metaphor\n\n00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:10.536\nto explain to you this complicated concept.\n\n00:04:10.536 --> 00:04:15.302\nImagine that the locomotor system is a car.\n\n00:04:15.302 --> 00:04:17.548\nThe engine is the spinal cord.\n\n00:04:17.548 --> 00:04:20.806\nThe transmission is interrupted. The engine is turned off.\n\n00:04:20.806 --> 00:04:23.813\nHow could we re-engage the engine?\n\n00:04:23.813 --> 00:04:26.955\nFirst, we have to provide the fuel;\n\n00:04:26.955 --> 00:04:29.298\nsecond, press the accelerator pedal;\n\n00:04:29.298 --> 00:04:31.236\nthird, steer the car.\n\n00:04:31.236 --> 00:04:32.998\nIt turned out that there are known neural pathways\n\n00:04:32.998 --> 00:04:35.952\ncoming from the brain that play this very function\n\n00:04:35.952 --> 00:04:37.334\nduring locomotion.\n\n00:04:37.334 --> 00:04:40.049\nMy idea: Replace this missing input\n\n00:04:40.049 --> 00:04:41.451\nto provide the spinal cord\n\n00:04:41.451 --> 00:04:42.847\nwith the kind of intervention\n\n00:04:42.847 --> 00:04:47.577\nthat the brain would deliver naturally in order to walk.\n\n00:04:47.577 --> 00:04:52.016\nFor this, I leveraged 20 years of past research in neuroscience,\n\n00:04:52.016 --> 00:04:54.780\nfirst to replace the missing fuel\n\n00:04:54.780 --> 00:04:56.848\nwith pharmacological agents\n\n00:04:56.848 --> 00:05:00.328\nthat prepare the neurons in the spinal cord to fire,\n\n00:05:00.328 --> 00:05:04.383\nand second, to mimic the accelerator pedal\n\n00:05:04.383 --> 00:05:05.863\nwith electrical stimulation.\n\n00:05:05.863 --> 00:05:08.032\nSo here imagine an electrode\n\n00:05:08.032 --> 00:05:10.438\nimplanted on the back of the spinal cord\n\n00:05:10.438 --> 00:05:12.700\nto deliver painless stimulation.\n\n00:05:12.700 --> 00:05:15.532\nIt took many years, but eventually we developed\n\n00:05:15.532 --> 00:05:18.089\nan electrochemical neuroprosthesis\n\n00:05:18.089 --> 00:05:19.855\nthat transformed the neural network\n\n00:05:19.855 --> 00:05:24.861\nin the spinal cord from dormant to a highly functional state.\n\n00:05:24.861 --> 00:05:31.141\nImmediately, the paralyzed rat can stand.\n\n00:05:31.141 --> 00:05:33.468\nAs soon as the treadmill belt starts moving,\n\n00:05:33.468 --> 00:05:37.274\nthe animal shows coordinated movement of the leg,\n\n00:05:37.274 --> 00:05:39.252\nbut without the brain.\n\n00:05:39.252 --> 00:05:41.242\nHere what I call \"the spinal brain\"\n\n00:05:41.242 --> 00:05:44.364\ncognitively processes sensory information\n\n00:05:44.364 --> 00:05:46.259\narising from the moving leg\n\n00:05:46.259 --> 00:05:49.954\nand makes decisions as to how to activate the muscle\n\n00:05:49.954 --> 00:05:53.344\nin order to stand, to walk, to run,\n\n00:05:53.344 --> 00:05:55.456\nand even here, while sprinting,\n\n00:05:55.456 --> 00:05:57.753\ninstantly stand\n\n00:05:57.753 --> 00:06:00.216\nif the treadmill stops moving.\n\n00:06:00.216 --> 00:06:01.553\nThis was amazing.\n\n00:06:01.553 --> 00:06:04.940\nI was completely fascinated by this locomotion\n\n00:06:04.940 --> 00:06:07.435\nwithout the brain,\n\n00:06:07.435 --> 00:06:11.090\nbut at the same time so frustrated.\n\n00:06:11.090 --> 00:06:13.483\nThis locomotion was completely involuntary.\n\n00:06:13.483 --> 00:06:16.848\nThe animal had virtually no control over the legs.\n\n00:06:16.848 --> 00:06:20.968\nClearly, the steering system was missing.\n\n00:06:20.968 --> 00:06:22.860\nAnd it then became obvious from me\n\n00:06:22.860 --> 00:06:24.208\nthat we had to move away\n\n00:06:24.208 --> 00:06:27.580\nfrom the classical rehabilitation paradigm,\n\n00:06:27.580 --> 00:06:29.302\nstepping on a treadmill,\n\n00:06:29.302 --> 00:06:32.522\nand develop conditions that would encourage\n\n00:06:32.522 --> 00:06:37.755\nthe brain to begin voluntary control over the leg.\n\n00:06:37.755 --> 00:06:41.140\nWith this in mind, we developed a completely new\n\n00:06:41.140 --> 00:06:44.370\nrobotic system to support the rat\n\n00:06:44.370 --> 00:06:46.896\nin any direction of space.\n\n00:06:46.896 --> 00:06:49.071\nImagine, this is really cool.\n\n00:06:49.071 --> 00:06:52.902\nSo imagine the little 200-gram rat\n\n00:06:52.902 --> 00:06:56.603\nattached at the extremity of this 200-kilo robot,\n\n00:06:56.603 --> 00:06:59.175\nbut the rat does not feel the robot.\n\n00:06:59.175 --> 00:07:01.247\nThe robot is transparent,\n\n00:07:01.247 --> 00:07:03.609\njust like you would hold a young child\n\n00:07:03.609 --> 00:07:05.973\nduring the first insecure steps.\n\n00:07:05.973 --> 00:07:09.527\nLet me summarize: The rat received\n\n00:07:09.527 --> 00:07:11.972\na paralyzing lesion of the spinal cord.\n\n00:07:11.972 --> 00:07:14.562\nThe electrochemical neuroprosthesis enabled\n\n00:07:14.562 --> 00:07:18.769\na highly functional state of the spinal locomotor networks.\n\n00:07:18.769 --> 00:07:22.535\nThe robot provided the safe environment\n\n00:07:22.535 --> 00:07:24.498\nto allow the rat to attempt anything\n\n00:07:24.498 --> 00:07:27.180\nto engage the paralyzed legs.\n\n00:07:27.180 --> 00:07:30.005\nAnd for motivation, we used what I think\n\n00:07:30.005 --> 00:07:33.839\nis the most powerful pharmacology of Switzerland:\n\n00:07:33.839 --> 00:07:36.146\nfine Swiss chocolate.\n\n00:07:36.146 --> 00:07:39.068\n(Laughter)\n\n00:07:39.068 --> 00:07:43.631\nActually, the first results were very, very,\n\n00:07:43.631 --> 00:07:46.266\nvery disappointing.\n\n00:07:46.266 --> 00:07:49.568\nHere is my best physical therapist\n\n00:07:56.752 --> 00:07:59.342\ncompletely failing to encourage the rat\n\n00:07:59.342 --> 00:08:01.403\nto take a single step,\n\n00:08:01.403 --> 00:08:04.249\nwhereas the same rat, five minutes earlier,\n\n00:08:04.249 --> 00:08:06.555\nwalked beautifully on the treadmill.\n\n00:08:06.555 --> 00:08:08.712\nWe were so frustrated.\n\n00:08:08.712 --> 00:08:11.611\nBut you know, one of the most essential qualities\n\n00:08:11.611 --> 00:08:14.087\nof a scientist is perseverance.\n\n00:08:14.087 --> 00:08:17.503\nWe insisted. We refined our paradigm,\n\n00:08:17.503 --> 00:08:19.766\nand after several months of training,\n\n00:08:19.766 --> 00:08:23.572\nthe otherwise paralyzed rat could stand,\n\n00:08:23.572 --> 00:08:25.384\nand whenever she decided,\n\n00:08:25.384 --> 00:08:27.716\ninitiated full weight-bearing locomotion\n\n00:08:27.716 --> 00:08:30.966\nto sprint towards the rewards.\n\n00:08:30.966 --> 00:08:34.371\nThis is the first recovery ever observed\n\n00:08:34.371 --> 00:08:36.265\nof voluntary leg movement\n\n00:08:36.265 --> 00:08:38.719\nafter an experimental lesion of the spinal cord\n\n00:08:38.719 --> 00:08:42.180\nleading to complete and permanent paralysis.\n\n00:08:42.180 --> 00:08:44.167\nIn fact --\n\n00:08:44.167 --> 00:08:45.887\n(Applause)\n\n00:08:45.887 --> 00:08:50.266\nThank you.\n\n00:08:50.266 --> 00:08:53.360\nIn fact, not only could the rat initiate\n\n00:08:53.360 --> 00:08:56.037\nand sustain locomotion on the ground,\n\n00:08:56.037 --> 00:08:58.318\nthey could even adjust leg movement,\n\n00:08:58.318 --> 00:09:00.674\nfor example, to resist gravity\n\n00:09:00.674 --> 00:09:03.298\nin order to climb a staircase.\n\n00:09:03.298 --> 00:09:05.248\nI can promise you this was\n\n00:09:05.248 --> 00:09:08.357\nsuch an emotional moment in my laboratory.\n\n00:09:08.357 --> 00:09:11.100\nIt took us 10 years of hard work\n\n00:09:11.100 --> 00:09:13.551\nto reach this goal.\n\n00:09:13.551 --> 00:09:16.102\nBut the remaining question was, how?\n\n00:09:16.102 --> 00:09:17.794\nI mean, how is it possible?\n\n00:09:17.794 --> 00:09:19.472\nAnd here, what we found\n\n00:09:19.472 --> 00:09:23.148\nwas completely unexpected.\n\n00:09:23.148 --> 00:09:27.306\nThis novel training paradigm\n\n00:09:27.306 --> 00:09:30.977\nencouraged the brain to create new connections,\n\n00:09:30.977 --> 00:09:33.879\nsome relay circuits\n\n00:09:33.879 --> 00:09:36.927\nthat relay information from the brain\n\n00:09:36.927 --> 00:09:40.083\npast the injury and restore cortical control\n\n00:09:40.083 --> 00:09:43.524\nover the locomotor networks below the injury.\n\n00:09:43.524 --> 00:09:46.446\nAnd here, you can see one such example,\n\n00:09:46.446 --> 00:09:49.809\nwhere we label the fibers coming from the brain in red.\n\n00:09:49.809 --> 00:09:53.229\nThis blue neuron is connected with the locomotor center,\n\n00:09:53.229 --> 00:09:55.592\nand what this constellation\n\n00:09:55.592 --> 00:09:57.943\nof synaptic contacts means\n\n00:09:57.943 --> 00:10:01.742\nis that the brain is reconnected with the locomotor center\n\n00:10:01.742 --> 00:10:05.740\nwith only one relay neuron.\n\n00:10:05.740 --> 00:10:07.671\nBut the remodeling was not restricted\n\n00:10:07.671 --> 00:10:08.758\nto the lesion area.\n\n00:10:08.758 --> 00:10:12.047\nIt occurred throughout the central nervous system,\n\n00:10:12.047 --> 00:10:14.365\nincluding in the brain stem,\n\n00:10:14.365 --> 00:10:17.627\nwhere we observed up to 300-percent increase\n\n00:10:17.627 --> 00:10:21.386\nin the density of fibers coming from the brain.\n\n00:10:21.386 --> 00:10:24.913\nWe did not aim to repair the spinal cord,\n\n00:10:24.913 --> 00:10:27.510\nyet we were able to promote\n\n00:10:27.510 --> 00:10:29.667\none of the more extensive remodeling\n\n00:10:29.667 --> 00:10:32.136\nof axonal projections ever observed\n\n00:10:32.136 --> 00:10:34.397\nin the central nervous system of adult mammal\n\n00:10:34.397 --> 00:10:36.942\nafter an injury.\n\n00:10:36.942 --> 00:10:42.011\nAnd there is a very important message\n\n00:10:42.011 --> 00:10:46.454\nhidden behind this discovery.\n\n00:10:46.454 --> 00:10:49.676\nThey are the result of a young team\n\n00:10:49.676 --> 00:10:52.068\nof very talented people:\n\n00:10:52.068 --> 00:10:56.526\nphysical therapists, neurobiologists, neurosurgeons,\n\n00:10:56.526 --> 00:10:58.725\nengineers of all kinds,\n\n00:10:58.725 --> 00:11:00.516\nwho have achieved together\n\n00:11:00.516 --> 00:11:04.159\nwhat would have been impossible by single individuals.\n\n00:11:04.159 --> 00:11:07.242\nThis is truly a trans-disciplinary team.\n\n00:11:07.242 --> 00:11:09.430\nThey are working so close to each other\n\n00:11:09.430 --> 00:11:12.621\nthat there is horizontal transfer of DNA.\n\n00:11:12.621 --> 00:11:14.244\nWe are creating the next generation\n\n00:11:14.244 --> 00:11:16.485\nof M.D.'s and engineers\n\n00:11:16.485 --> 00:11:18.929\ncapable of translating discoveries all the way\n\n00:11:18.929 --> 00:11:21.601\nfrom bench to bedside.\n\n00:11:21.601 --> 00:11:23.607\nAnd me?\n\n00:11:23.607 --> 00:11:28.154\nI am only the maestro who orchestrated this beautiful symphony.\n\n00:11:28.154 --> 00:11:34.957\nNow, I am sure you are all wondering, aren't you,\n\n00:11:34.957 --> 00:11:38.721\nwill this help injured people?\n\n00:11:38.721 --> 00:11:42.613\nMe too, every day.\n\n00:11:42.613 --> 00:11:46.026\nThe truth is that we don't know enough yet.\n\n00:11:46.026 --> 00:11:50.250\nThis is certainly not a cure for spinal cord injury,\n\n00:11:50.250 --> 00:11:52.984\nbut I begin to believe that this may lead\n\n00:11:52.984 --> 00:11:55.551\nto an intervention to improve recovery\n\n00:11:55.551 --> 00:11:58.738\nand people's quality of life.\n\n00:11:58.738 --> 00:12:01.227\nI would like you all\n\n00:12:01.227 --> 00:12:04.854\nto take a moment and dream with me.\n\n00:12:04.854 --> 00:12:10.749\nImagine a person just suffered a spinal cord injury.\n\n00:12:10.749 --> 00:12:13.904\nAfter a few weeks of recovery,\n\n00:12:13.904 --> 00:12:16.264\nwe will implant a programmable pump\n\n00:12:16.264 --> 00:12:19.297\nto deliver a personalized pharmacological cocktail\n\n00:12:19.297 --> 00:12:21.739\ndirectly to the spinal cord.\n\n00:12:21.739 --> 00:12:25.002\nAt the same time, we will implant an electrode array,\n\n00:12:25.002 --> 00:12:27.109\na sort of second skin\n\n00:12:27.109 --> 00:12:30.669\ncovering the area of the spinal cord controlling leg movement,\n\n00:12:30.669 --> 00:12:33.935\nand this array is attached to an electrical pulse generator\n\n00:12:33.935 --> 00:12:36.397\nthat delivers stimulations that are tailored\n\n00:12:36.397 --> 00:12:38.583\nto the person's needs.\n\n00:12:38.583 --> 00:12:43.441\nThis defines a personalized electrochemical neuroprosthesis\n\n00:12:43.441 --> 00:12:46.192\nthat will enable locomotion\n\n00:12:46.192 --> 00:12:50.239\nduring training with a newly designed supporting system.\n\n00:12:50.239 --> 00:12:53.522\nAnd my hope is that after several months of training,\n\n00:12:53.522 --> 00:12:55.685\nthere may be enough remodeling of residual connection\n\n00:12:55.685 --> 00:12:59.354\nto allow locomotion without the robot,\n\n00:12:59.354 --> 00:13:03.132\nmaybe even without pharmacology or stimulation.\n\n00:13:03.132 --> 00:13:05.666\nMy hope here is to be able to create\n\n00:13:05.666 --> 00:13:07.931\nthe personalized condition\n\n00:13:07.931 --> 00:13:10.594\nto boost the plasticity of the brain\n\n00:13:10.594 --> 00:13:12.125\nand the spinal cord.\n\n00:13:12.125 --> 00:13:14.864\nAnd this is a radically new concept\n\n00:13:14.864 --> 00:13:18.157\nthat may apply to other neurological disorders,\n\n00:13:18.157 --> 00:13:22.695\nwhat I termed \"personalized neuroprosthetics,\"\n\n00:13:22.695 --> 00:13:25.719\nwhere by sensing and stimulating neural interfaces,\n\n00:13:25.719 --> 00:13:29.433\nI implanted throughout the nervous system,\n\n00:13:29.433 --> 00:13:32.774\nin the brain, in the

phone. They've changed the world. However, largely to our surprise, they also turned out to be the perfect tools for the surveillance state. It turned out that the capability to collect data, information and connections about basically any of us and all of us is exactly what we've been hearing throughout of the summer through revelations and leaks about Western intelligence agencies, mostly U.S. intelligence agencies, watching over the rest of the world.We've heard about these starting with the revelations from June 6. Edward Snowden started leaking information, top secret classified information, from the U.S. intelligence agencies, and we started learning about things like PRISM and XKeyscore and others. And these are examples of the kinds of programs U.S. intelligence agencies are running right now, against the whole rest of the world.And if you look back about the forecasts on surveillance by George Orwell, well it turns out that George Orwell was an optimist. (Laughter) We are right now seeing a much larger scale of tracking of individual citizens than he could have ever imagined.And this here is the infamous NSA data center in Utah. Due to be opened very soon, it will be both a supercomputing center and a data storage center. You could basically imagine it has a large hall filled with hard drives storing data they are collecting. And it's a pretty big building. How big? Well, I can give you the numbers \u2014 140,000 square meters \u2014 but that doesn't really tell you very much. Maybe it's better to imagine it as a comparison. You think about the largest IKEA store you've ever been in. This is five times larger. How many hard drives can you fit in an IKEA store? Right? It's pretty big. We estimate that just the electricity bill for running this data center is going to be in the tens of millions of dollars a year. And this kind of wholesale surveillance means that they can collect our data and keep it basically forever, keep it for extended periods of time, keep it for years, keep it for decades. And this opens up completely new kinds of risks to us all. And what this is is that it is wholesale blanket surveillance on everyone.Well, not exactly everyone, because the U.S. intelligence only has a legal right to monitor foreigners. They can monitor foreigners when foreigners' data connections end up in the United States or pass through the United States. And monitoring foreigners doesn't sound too bad until you realize that I'm a foreigner and you're a foreigner. In fact, 96 percent of the planet are foreigners.(Laughter)Right?So it is wholesale blanket surveillance of all of us, all of us who use telecommunications and the Internet.But don't get me wrong: There are actually types of surveillance that are okay. I love freedom, but even I agree that some surveillance is fine. If the law enforcement is trying to find a murderer, or they're trying to catch a drug lord or trying to prevent a school shooting, and they have leads and they have suspects, then it's perfectly fine for them to tap the suspect's phone, and to intercept his Internet communications. I'm not arguing that at all, but that's not what programs like PRISM are about. They are not about doing surveillance on people that they have reason to suspect of some wrongdoings. They're about doing surveillance on people they know are innocent.So the four main arguments supporting surveillance like this, well, the first of all is that whenever you start discussing about these revelations, there will be naysayers trying to minimize the importance of these revelations, saying that we knew all this already, we knew it was happening, there's nothing new here. And that's not true. Don't let anybody tell you that we knew this already, because we did not know this already. Our worst fears might have been something like this, but we didn't know this was happening. Now we know for a fact it's happening. We didn't know about this. We didn't know about PRISM. We didn't know about XKeyscore. We didn't know about Cybertrans. We didn't know about DoubleArrow. We did not know about Skywriter \u2014 all these different programs run by U.S. intelligence agencies. But now we do.And we did not know that U.S. intelligence agencies go to extremes such as infiltrating standardization bodies to sabotage encryption algorithms on purpose. And what that means is that you take something which is secure, an encryption algorithm which is so secure that if you use that algorithm to encrypt one file, nobody can decrypt that file. Even if they take every single computer on the planet just to decrypt that one file, it's going to take millions of years. So that's basically perfectly safe, uncrackable. You take something which is that good and then you weaken it on purpose, making all of us less secure as an end result. A real-world equivalent would be that intelligence agencies would force some secret pin code into every single house alarm so they could get into every single house because, you know, bad people might have house alarms, but it will also make all of us less secure as an end result. Backdooring encryption algorithms just boggles the mind. But of course, these intelligence agencies are doing their job. This is what they have been told to do: do signals intelligence, monitor telecommunications, monitor Internet traffic. That's what they're trying to do, and since most, a very big part of the Internet traffic today is encrypted, they're trying to find ways around the encryption. One way is to sabotage encryption algorithms, which is a great example about how U.S. intelligence agencies are running loose. They are completely out of control, and they should be brought back under control.So what do we actually know about the leaks? Everything is based on the files leaked by Mr. Snowden. The very first PRISM slides from the beginning of June detail a collection program where the data is collected from service providers, and they actually go and name the service providers they have access to. They even have a specific date on when the collection of data began for each of the service providers. So for example, they name the collection from Microsoft started on September 11, 2007, for Yahoo on the March 12, 2008, and then others: Google, Facebook, Skype, Apple and so on.And every single one of these companies denies. They all say that this simply isn't true, that they are not giving backdoor access to their data. Yet we have these files. So is one of the parties lying, or is there some other alternative explanation? And one explanation would be that these parties, these service providers, are not cooperating. Instead, they've been hacked. That would explain it. They aren't cooperating. They've been hacked. In this case, they've been hacked by their own government. That might sound outlandish, but we already have cases where this has happened, for example, the case of the Flame malware which we strongly believe was authored by the U.S. government, and which, to spread, subverted the security of the Windows Update network, meaning here, the company was hacked by their own government. And there's more evidence supporting this theory as well. Der Spiegel, from Germany, leaked more information about the operations run by the elite hacker units operating inside these intelligence agencies. Inside NSA, the unit is called TAO, Tailored Access Operations, and inside GCHQ, which is the U.K. equivalent, it's called NAC, Network Analysis Centre. And these recent leaks of these three slides detail an operation run by this GCHQ intelligence agency from the United Kingdom targeting a telecom here in Belgium. And what this really means is that an E.U. country's intelligence agency is breaching the security of a telecom of a fellow E.U. country on purpose, and they discuss it in their slides completely casually, business as usual. Here's the primary target, here's the secondary target, here's the teaming. They probably have a team building on Thursday evening in a pub. They even use cheesy PowerPoint clip art like, you know, \"Success,\" when they gain access to services like this. What the hell?And then there's the argument that okay, yes, this might be going on, but then again, other countries are doing it as well. All countries spy. And maybe that's true. Many countries spy, not all of them, but let's take an example. Let's take, for example, Sweden. I'm speaking of Sweden because Sweden has a little bit of a similar law to the United States. When your data traffic goes through Sweden, their intelligence agency has a legal right by the law to intercept that traffic. All right, how many Swedish decisionmakers and politicians and business leaders use, every day, U.S.-based services, like, you know, run Windows or OSX, or use Facebook or LinkedIn, or store their data in clouds like iCloud or Skydrive or DropBox, or maybe use online services like Amazon web services or sales support? And the answer is, every single Swedish business leader does that every single day. And then we turn it around. How many American leaders use Swedish webmails and cloud services? And the answer is zero. So this is not balanced. It's not balanced by any means, not even close.And when we do have the occasional European success story, even those, then, typically end up being sold to the United States. Like, Skype used to be secure. It used to be end-to-end encrypted. Then it was sold to the United States. Today, it no longer is secure. So once again, we take something which is secure and then we make it less secure on purpose, making all of us less secure as an outcome.And then the argument that the United States is only fighting terrorists. It's the war on terror. You shouldn't worry about it. Well, it's not the war on terror. Yes, part of it is war on terror, and yes, there are terrorists, and they do kill and maim, and we should fight them, but we know through these leaks that they have used the same techniques to listen to phone calls of European leaders, to tap the email of residents of Mexico and Brazil, to read email traffic inside the United Nations Headquarters and E.U. Parliament, and I don't think they are trying to find terrorists from inside the E.U. Parliament, right? It's not the war on terror. Part of it might be, and there are terrorists, but are we really thinking about terrorists as such an existential threat that we are willing to do anything at all to fight them? Are the Americans ready to throw away the Constituion and throw it in the trash just because there are terrorists? And the same thing with the Bill of Rights and all the amendments and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the E.U. conventions on human rights and fundamental freedoms and the press freedom? Do we really think terrorism is such an existential threat, we are ready to do anything at all?But people are scared about terrorists, and then they think that maybe that surveillance is okay because they have nothing to hide. Feel free to survey me if that helps. And whoever tells you that they have nothing to hide simply hasn't thought about this long enough.(Applause)Because we have this thing called privacy, and if you really think that you have nothing to hide, please make sure that's the first thing you tell me, because then I know that I should not trust you with any secrets, because obviously you can't keep a secret. But people are brutally honest with the Internet, and when these leaks started, many people were asking me about this. And I have nothing to hide. I'm not doing anything bad or anything illegal. Yet, I have nothing that I would in particular like to share with an intelligence agency, especially a foreign intelligence agency. And if we indeed need a Big Brother, I would much rather have a domestic Big Brother than a foreign Big Brother. And when the leaks started, the very first thing I tweeted about this was a comment about how, when you've been using search engines, you've been potentially leaking all that to U.S. intelligence. And two minutes later, I got a reply by somebody called Kimberly from the United States challenging me, like, why am I worried about this? What am I sending to worry about this? Am I sending naked pictures or something? And my answer to Kimberly was that what I'm sending is none of your business, and it should be none of your government's business either. Because that's what it's about. It's about privacy. Privacy is nonnegotiable. It should be built in to all the systems we use.(Applause)And one thing we should all understand is that we are brutally honest with search engines. You show me your search history, and I'll find something incriminating or something embarrassing there in five minutes. We are more honest with search engines than we are with our families. Search engines know more about you than your family members know about you. And this is all the kind of information we are giving away, we are giving away to the United States.And surveillance changes history. We know this through examples of corrupt presidents like Nixon. Imagine if he would have had the kind of surveillance tools that are available today. And let me actually quote the president of Brazil, Ms. Dilma Rousseff. She was one of the targets of NSA surveillance. Her email was read, and she spoke at the United Nations Headquarters, and she said, \"If there is no right to privacy, there can be no true freedom of expression and opinion, and therefore, there can be no effective democracy.\"That's what it's about. Privacy is the building block of our democracies. And to quote a fellow security researcher, Marcus Ranum, he said that the United States is right now treating the Internet as it would be treating one of its colonies. So we are back to the age of colonization, and we, the foreign users of the Internet, we should think about Americans as our masters.So Mr. Snowden, he's been blamed for many things. Some are blaming him for causing problems for the U.S. cloud industry and software companies with these revelations \u2014 and blaming Snowden for causing problems for the U.S. cloud industry would be the equivalent of blaming Al Gore for causing global warming.(Laughter)(Applause)So, what is there to be done? Should we worry. No, we shouldn't worry. We should be angry, because this is wrong, and it's rude, and it should not be done. But that's not going to really change the situation. What's going to change the situation for the rest of the world is to try to steer away from systems built in the United States. And that's much easier said than done. How do you do that? A single country, any single country in Europe cannot replace and build replacements for the U.S.-made operating systems and cloud services.But maybe you don't have to do it alone. Maybe you can do it together with other countries. The solution is open source. By building together open, free, secure systems, we can go around such surveillance, and then one country doesn't have to solve the problem by itself. It only has to solve one little problem. And to quote a fellow security researcher, Haroon Meer, one country only has to make a small wave, but those small waves together become a tide, and the tide will lift all the boats up at the same time, and the tide we will build with secure, free, open-source systems, will become the tide that will lift all of us up and above the surveillance state.Thank you very much.(Applause)", "id": 1861, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:17.084\nThe two most likely largest inventions\n\n00:00:17.084 --> 00:00:19.331\nof our generation\n\n00:00:19.331 --> 00:00:22.524\nare the Internet and the mobile phone.\n\n00:00:22.524 --> 00:00:24.659\nThey've changed the world.\n\n00:00:24.659 --> 00:00:28.174\nHowever, largely to our surprise,\n\n00:00:28.174 --> 00:00:32.572\nthey also turned out to be the perfect tools\n\n00:00:32.572 --> 00:00:35.722\nfor the surveillance state.\n\n00:00:35.722 --> 00:00:38.619\nIt turned out that the capability\n\n00:00:38.619 --> 00:00:42.663\nto collect data, information and connections\n\n00:00:42.663 --> 00:00:46.881\nabout basically any of us and all of us\n\n00:00:46.881 --> 00:00:48.694\nis exactly what we've been hearing\n\n00:00:48.694 --> 00:00:53.301\nthroughout of the summer\nthrough revelations and leaks\n\n00:00:53.301 --> 00:00:56.392\nabout Western intelligence agencies,\n\n00:00:56.392 --> 00:00:59.418\nmostly U.S. intelligence agencies,\n\n00:00:59.418 --> 00:01:02.591\nwatching over the rest of the world.\n\n00:01:02.591 --> 00:01:05.789\nWe've heard about these starting with the\n\n00:01:05.789 --> 00:01:09.475\nrevelations from June 6.\n\n00:01:09.475 --> 00:01:12.544\nEdward Snowden started leaking information,\n\n00:01:12.544 --> 00:01:14.848\ntop secret classified information,\n\n00:01:14.848 --> 00:01:16.315\nfrom the U.S. intelligence agencies,\n\n00:01:16.315 --> 00:01:18.784\nand we started learning about things like PRISM\n\n00:01:18.784 --> 00:01:22.051\nand XKeyscore and others.\n\n00:01:22.051 --> 00:01:25.156\nAnd these are examples of the kinds of programs\n\n00:01:25.156 --> 00:01:29.435\nU.S. intelligence agencies are running right now,\n\n00:01:29.435 --> 00:01:32.951\nagainst the whole rest of the world.\n\n00:01:32.951 --> 00:01:36.659\nAnd if you look back about the forecasts\n\n00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:40.760\non surveillance by George Orwell,\n\n00:01:40.775 --> 00:01:42.893\nwell it turns out that\n\n00:01:42.893 --> 00:01:45.397\nGeorge Orwell was an optimist.\n\n00:01:45.397 --> 00:01:47.877\n(Laughter)\n\n00:01:47.877 --> 00:01:50.577\nWe are right now seeing a much larger scale\n\n00:01:50.577 --> 00:01:52.475\nof tracking of individual citizens\n\n00:01:52.475 --> 00:01:56.107\nthan he could have ever imagined.\n\n00:01:56.107 --> 00:01:59.642\nAnd this here is the infamous\n\n00:01:59.642 --> 00:02:03.486\nNSA data center in Utah.\n\n00:02:03.486 --> 00:02:06.642\nDue to be opened very soon,\n\n00:02:06.642 --> 00:02:09.433\nit will be both a supercomputing center\n\n00:02:09.433 --> 00:02:11.570\nand a data storage center.\n\n00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:14.463\nYou could basically imagine it has a large hall\n\n00:02:14.463 --> 00:02:16.919\nfilled with hard drives storing data\n\n00:02:16.919 --> 00:02:19.193\nthey are collecting.\n\n00:02:19.193 --> 00:02:21.350\nAnd it's a pretty big building.\n\n00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:23.201\nHow big?

Don't let anybody tell you\n\n00:05:07.829 --> 00:05:13.541\nthat we knew this already,\nbecause we did not know this already.\n\n00:05:13.541 --> 00:05:17.314\nOur worst fears might have been something like this,\n\n00:05:17.314 --> 00:05:19.265\nbut we didn't know this was happening.\n\n00:05:19.265 --> 00:05:22.042\nNow we know for a fact it's happening.\n\n00:05:22.042 --> 00:05:24.621\nWe didn't know about this.\nWe didn't know about PRISM.\n\n00:05:24.621 --> 00:05:27.527\nWe didn't know about XKeyscore.\nWe didn't know about Cybertrans.\n\n00:05:27.527 --> 00:05:29.477\nWe didn't know about DoubleArrow.\n\n00:05:29.477 --> 00:05:31.625\nWe did not know about Skywriter --\n\n00:05:31.625 --> 00:05:33.320\nall these different programs\n\n00:05:33.320 --> 00:05:36.561\nrun by U.S. intelligence agencies.\n\n00:05:36.561 --> 00:05:39.590\nBut now we do.\n\n00:05:39.590 --> 00:05:41.756\nAnd we did not know\n\n00:05:41.756 --> 00:05:44.831\nthat U.S. intelligence agencies go to extremes\n\n00:05:44.831 --> 00:05:48.668\nsuch as infiltrating standardization bodies\n\n00:05:48.668 --> 00:05:53.416\nto sabotage encryption algorithms on purpose.\n\n00:05:53.416 --> 00:05:55.453\nAnd what that means\n\n00:05:55.453 --> 00:05:57.273\nis that you take something which is secure,\n\n00:05:57.273 --> 00:05:59.694\nan encryption algorithm which is so secure\n\n00:05:59.694 --> 00:06:02.801\nthat if you use that algorithm to encrypt one file,\n\n00:06:02.801 --> 00:06:04.543\nnobody can decrypt that file.\n\n00:06:04.543 --> 00:06:08.956\nEven if they take every single computer on the planet just to decrypt that one file,\n\n00:06:08.956 --> 00:06:11.016\nit's going to take millions of years.\n\n00:06:11.016 --> 00:06:13.263\nSo that's basically perfectly safe, uncrackable.\n\n00:06:13.263 --> 00:06:15.337\nYou take something which is that good\n\n00:06:15.337 --> 00:06:17.821\nand then you weaken it on purpose,\n\n00:06:17.821 --> 00:06:23.431\nmaking all of us less secure as an end result.\n\n00:06:23.431 --> 00:06:25.562\nA real-world equivalent would be that\n\n00:06:25.562 --> 00:06:28.214\nintelligence agencies would force\n\n00:06:28.214 --> 00:06:31.041\nsome secret pin code into every single house alarm\n\n00:06:31.041 --> 00:06:32.834\nso they could get into every single house\n\n00:06:32.834 --> 00:06:35.080\nbecause, you know, bad people\nmight have house alarms,\n\n00:06:35.080 --> 00:06:37.519\nbut it will also make all of us\n\n00:06:37.519 --> 00:06:39.748\nless secure as an end result.\n\n00:06:39.748 --> 00:06:43.488\nBackdooring encryption algorithms\n\n00:06:43.488 --> 00:06:46.584\njust boggles the mind.\n\n00:06:46.584 --> 00:06:50.359\nBut of course, these intelligence agencies\nare doing their job.\n\n00:06:50.359 --> 00:06:52.116\nThis is what they have been told to do:\n\n00:06:52.116 --> 00:06:54.346\ndo signals intelligence,\n\n00:06:54.346 --> 00:06:56.358\nmonitor telecommunications,\n\n00:06:56.358 --> 00:06:57.780\nmonitor Internet traffic.\n\n00:06:57.780 --> 00:06:59.488\nThat's what they're trying to do,\n\n00:06:59.488 --> 00:07:02.570\nand since most, a very big part\nof the Internet traffic today is encrypted,\n\n00:07:02.570 --> 00:07:04.527\nthey're trying to find ways around the encryption.\n\n00:07:04.527 --> 00:07:07.584\nOne way is to sabotage encryption algorithms,\n\n00:07:07.584 --> 00:07:09.469\nwhich is a great example\n\n00:07:09.469 --> 00:07:11.690\nabout how U.S. intelligence agencies\n\n00:07:11.690 --> 00:07:13.439\nare running loose.\n\n00:07:13.439 --> 00:07:15.280\nThey are completely out of control,\n\n00:07:15.280 --> 00:07:19.722\nand they should be brought back under control.\n\n00:07:21.587 --> 00:07:24.537\nSo what do we actually know about the leaks?\n\n00:07:24.537 --> 00:07:26.647\nEverything is based on the files\n\n00:07:26.647 --> 00:07:29.145\nleaked by Mr. Snowden.\n\n00:07:29.145 --> 00:07:31.993\nThe very first PRISM slides\n\n00:07:31.993 --> 00:07:33.982\nfrom the beginning of June\n\n00:07:33.982 --> 00:07:36.076\ndetail a collection program where the data\n\n00:07:36.076 --> 00:07:37.862\nis collected from service providers,\n\n00:07:37.862 --> 00:07:40.740\nand they actually go and name the service providers\n\n00:07:40.740 --> 00:07:42.071\nthey have access to.\n\n00:07:42.071 --> 00:07:45.013\nThey even have a specific date\n\n00:07:45.013 --> 00:07:47.677\non when the collection of data began\n\n00:07:47.677 --> 00:07:49.316\nfor each of the service providers.\n\n00:07:49.316 --> 00:07:51.603\nSo for example, they name\nthe collection from Microsoft\n\n00:07:51.603 --> 00:07:55.323\nstarted on September 11, 2007,\n\n00:07:55.323 --> 00:07:58.055\nfor Yahoo on the March 12, 2008,\n\n00:07:58.055 --> 00:08:01.071\nand then others: Google, Facebook,\n\n00:08:01.071 --> 00:08:04.315\nSkype, Apple and so on.\n\n00:08:04.315 --> 00:08:07.163\nAnd every single one of these companies denies.\n\n00:08:07.163 --> 00:08:11.558\nThey all say that this simply isn't true,\n\n00:08:11.558 --> 00:08:16.166\nthat they are not giving\nbackdoor access to their data.\n\n00:08:16.166 --> 00:08:20.289\nYet we have these files.\n\n00:08:20.289 --> 00:08:22.610\nSo is one of the parties lying,\n\n00:08:22.610 --> 00:08:25.933\nor is there some other alternative explanation?\n\n00:08:25.933 --> 00:08:28.855\nAnd one explanation would be\n\n00:08:28.855 --> 00:08:31.742\nthat these parties, these service providers,\n\n00:08:31.742 --> 00:08:33.658\nare not cooperating.\n\n00:08:33.658 --> 00:08:36.679\nInstead, they've been hacked.\n\n00:08:36.679 --> 00:08:39.896\nThat would explain it. They aren't cooperating. They've been hacked.\n\n00:08:39.896 --> 00:08:44.074\nIn this case, they've been hacked\nby their own government.\n\n00:08:44.074 --> 00:08:46.495\nThat might sound outlandish,\n\n00:08:46.495 --> 00:08:48.709\nbut we already have cases where this has happened,\n\n00:08:48.709 --> 00:08:51.755\nfor example, the case of the Flame malware\n\n00:08:51.755 --> 00:08:53.788\nwhich we strongly believe was authored\n\n00:08:53.788 --> 00:08:55.685\nby the U.S. government,\n\n00:08:55.685 --> 00:08:59.584\nand which, to spread, subverted the security\n\n00:08:59.584 --> 00:09:02.470\nof the Windows Update network,\n\n00:09:02.470 --> 00:09:06.563\nmeaning here, the company was hacked\n\n00:09:06.563 --> 00:09:08.921\nby their own government.\n\n00:09:08.921 --> 00:09:10.520\nAnd there's more evidence\n\n00:09:10.520 --> 00:09:13.071\nsupporting this theory as well.\n\n00:09:13.071 --> 00:09:17.076\nDer Spiegel, from Germany, leaked more information\n\n00:09:17.076 --> 00:09:21.341\nabout the operations run by the elite hacker units\n\n00:09:21.341 --> 00:09:24.376\noperating inside these intelligence agencies.\n\n00:09:24.376 --> 00:09:27.002\nInside NSA, the unit is called TAO,\n\n00:09:27.002 --> 00:09:28.847\nTailored Access Operations,\n\n00:09:28.847 --> 00:09:32.411\nand inside GCHQ, which is the U.K. equivalent,\n\n00:09:32.411 --> 00:09:36.410\nit's called NAC, Network Analysis Centre.\n\n00:09:36.410 --> 00:09:40.254\nAnd these recent leaks of these three slides\n\n00:09:40.254 --> 00:09:42.458\ndetail an operation\n\n00:09:42.458 --> 00:09:45.616\nrun by this GCHQ intelligence agency\n\n00:09:45.616 --> 00:09:47.425\nfrom the United Kingdom\n\n00:09:47.425 --> 00:09:51.658\ntargeting a telecom here in Belgium.\n\n00:09:51.658 --> 00:09:53.934\nAnd what this really means\n\n00:09:53.934 --> 00:09:57.822\nis that an E.U. country's intelligence agency\n\n00:09:57.822 --> 00:10:00.037\nis breaching the security\n\n00:10:00.037 --> 00:10:04.850\nof a telecom of a fellow E.U. country on purpose,\n\n00:10:04.850 --> 00:10:08.685\nand they discuss it in their slides completely casually,\n\n00:10:08.685 --> 00:10:10.286\nbusiness as usual.\n\n00:10:10.286 --> 00:10:11.954\nHere's the primary target,\n\n00:10:11.954 --> 00:10:13.332\nhere's the secondary target,\n\n00:10:13.332 --> 00:10:14.756\nhere's the teaming.\n\n00:10:14.756 --> 00:10:18.612\nThey probably have a team building\non Thursday evening in a pub.\n\n00:10:18.612 --> 00:10:21.653\nThey even use cheesy PowerPoint clip art\n\n00:10:21.653 --> 00:10:23.360\nlike, you know, \"Success,\"\n\n00:10:23.360 --> 00:10:26.624\nwhen they gain access to services like this.\n\n00:10:26.624 --> 00:10:29.450\nWhat the hell?\n\n00:10:31.643 --> 00:10:33.476\nAnd then there's the argument\n\n00:10:33.476 --> 00:10:35.136\nthat okay, yes, this might be going on,\n\n00:10:35.136 --> 00:10:37.773\nbut then again, other countries are doing it as well.\n\n00:10:37.773 --> 00:10:40.196\nAll countries spy.\n\n00:10:40.196 --> 00:10:41.934\nAnd maybe that's true.\n\n00:10:41.934 --> 00:10:44.372\nMany countries spy, not all of them,\nbut let's take an example.\n\n00:10:44.372 --> 00:10:46.483\nLet's take, for example, Sweden.\n\n00:10:46.483 --> 00:10:47.859\nI'm speaking of Sweden because Sweden\n\n00:10:47.859 --> 00:10:50.138\nhas a little bit of a similar law to the United States.\n\n00:10:50.138 --> 00:10:52.261\nWhen your data traffic goes through Sweden,\n\n00:10:52.261 --> 00:10:55.071\ntheir intelligence agency has a legal right by the law\n\n00:10:55.071 --> 00:10:57.072\nto intercept that traffic.\n\n00:10:57.072 --> 00:11:00.277\nAll right, how many Swedish decisionmakers\n\n00:11:00.277 --> 00:11:03.149\nand politicians and business leaders\n\n00:11:03.149 --> 00:11:06.222\nuse, every day, U.S.-based services,\n\n00:11:06.222 --> 00:11:09.490\nlike, you know, run Windows or OSX,\n\n00:11:09.490 --> 00:11:11.700\nor use Facebook or LinkedIn,\n\n00:11:11.700 --> 00:11:15.100\nor store their data in clouds like iCloud\n\n00:11:15.100 --> 00:11:18.994\nor Skydrive or DropBox,\n\n00:11:18.994 --> 00:11:23.297\nor maybe use online services like\nAmazon web services or sales support?\n\n00:11:23.297 --> 00:11:27.254\nAnd the answer is, every single Swedish\nbusiness leader does that every single day.\n\n00:11:27.254 --> 00:11:28.853\nAnd then we turn it around.\n\n00:11:28.853 --> 00:11:30.758\nHow many American leaders\n\n00:11:30.758 --> 00:11:35.051\nuse Swedish webmails and cloud services?\n\n00:11:35.051 --> 00:11:37.091\nAnd the answer is zero.\n\n00:11:37.091 --> 00:11:39.360\nSo this is not balanced.\n\n00:11:39.360 --> 00:11:43.985\nIt's not balanced by any means, not even close.\n\n00:11:43.985 --> 00:11:46.426\nAnd when we do have the occasional\n\n00:11:46.426 --> 00:11:48.427\nEuropean success story,\n\n00:11:48.427 --> 00:11:51.993\neven those, then, typically end up being sold\nto the United States.\n\n00:11:51.993 --> 00:11:54.257\nLike, Skype used to be secure.\n\n00:11:54.257 --> 00:11:56.990\nIt used to be end-to-end encrypted.\n\n00:11:56.990 --> 00:11:59.031\nThen it was sold to the United States.\n\n00:11:59.031 --> 00:12:01.680\nToday, it no longer is secure.\n\n00:12:01.680 --> 00:12:04.901\nSo once again, we take something which is secure\n\n00:12:04.901 --> 00:12:06.771\nand then we make it less secure on purpose,\n\n00:12:06.771 --> 00:12:11.255\nmaking all of us less secure as an outcome.\n\n00:12:12.813 --> 00:12:15.060\nAnd then the argument that the United States\n\n00:12:15.060 --> 00:12:17.078\nis only fighting terrorists.\n\n00:12:17.078 --> 00:12:18.244\nIt's the war on terror.\n\n00:12:18.244 --> 00:12:20.791\nYou shouldn't worry about it.\n\n00:12:20.791 --> 00:12:23.021\nWell, it's not the war on terror.\n\n00:12:23.021 --> 00:12:25.194\nYes, part of it is war on terror, and yes,\n\n00:12:25.194 --> 00:12:28.170\nthere are terrorists, and they do kill and maim,\n\n00:12:28.170 --> 00:12:29.721\nand we should fight them,\n\n00:12:29.721 --> 00:12:31.327\nbut we know through these leaks\n\n00:12:31.327 --> 00:12:33.909\nthat they have used the same techniques\n\n00:12:33.909 --> 00:12:37.245\nto listen to phone calls of European leaders,\n\n00:12:37.245 --> 00:12:40.700\nto tap the email of residents of Mexico and Brazil,\n\n00:12:40.700 --> 00:12:45.506\nto read email traffic inside the United Nations Headquarters and E.U. Parliament,\n\n00:12:45.506 --> 00:12:48.660\nand I don't think they are trying to find terrorists\n\n00:12:48.660 --> 00:12:51.678\nfrom inside the E.U. Parliament, right?\n\n00:12:51.678 --> 00:12:53.626\nIt's not the war on terror.\n\n00:12:53.626 --> 00:12:57.768\nPart of it might be, and there are terrorists,\n\n00:12:57.768 --> 00:13:00.195\nbut are we really thinking about terrorists\n\n00:13:00.195 --> 00:13:02.364\nas such an existential threat\n\n00:13:02.364 --> 00:13:06.040\nthat we are willing to do anything at all to fight them?\n\n00:13:06.040 --> 00:13:09.531\nAre the Americans ready\nto throw away the Constituion\n\n00:13:09.531 --> 00:13:13.772\nand throw it in the trash\njust because there are terrorists?\n\n00:13:13.772 --> 00:13:16.296\nAnd the same thing with the Bill of Rights\nand all the amendments\n\n00:13:16.296 --> 00:13:18.613\nand the Universal Declaration of Human Rights\n\n00:13:18.613 --> 00:13:23.764\nand the E.U. conventions on human rights\nand fundamental freedoms\n\n00:13:23.764 --> 00:13:25.281\nand the press freedom?\n\n00:13:25.281 --> 00:13:29.096\nDo we really think terrorism\nis such an existential threat,\n\n00:13:29.096 --> 00:13:32.222\nwe are ready to do anything at all?\n\n00:13:34.448 --> 00:13:37.112\nBut people are scared about terrorists,\n\n00:13:37.112 --> 00:13:39.526\nand then they think that\nmaybe that surveillance is okay\n\n00:13:39.526 --> 00:13:41.570\nbecause they have nothing to hide.\n\n00:13:41.570 --> 00:13:44.277\nFeel free to survey me if that helps.\n\n00:13:44.277 --> 00:13:47.165\nAnd whoever tells you that they have nothing to hide\n\n00:13:47.165 --> 00:13:51.878\nsimply hasn't thought about this long enough.\n\n00:13:54.478 --> 00:14:00.343\n(Applause)\n\n00:14:00.343 --> 00:14:03.115\nBecause we have this thing called privacy,\n\n00:14:03.115 --> 00:14:05.460\nand if you really think that you have nothing to hide,\n\n00:14:05.460 --> 00:14:07.676\nplease make sure that's the first thing you tell me,\n\n00:14:07.676 --> 00:14:09.226\nbecause then I know\n\n00:14:09.226 --> 00:14:10.866\nthat I should not trust you with any secrets,\n\n00:14:10.866 --> 00:14:14.164\nbecause obviously you can't keep a secret.\n\n00:14:17.023 --> 00:14:20.852\nBut people are brutally honest with the Internet,\n\n00:14:20.852 --> 00:14:23.548\nand when these leaks started,\n\n00:14:23.548 --> 00:14:25.426\nmany people were asking me about this.\n\n00:14:25.426 --> 00:14:27.000\nAnd I have nothing to hide.\n\n00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:30.290\nI'm not doing anything bad or anything illegal.\n\n00:14:30.290 --> 00:14:33.075\nYet, I have nothing that I would in particular\n\n00:14:33.075 --> 00:14:35.868\nlike to share with an intelligence agency,\n\n00:14:35.868 --> 00:14:40.005\nespecially a foreign intelligence agency.\n\n00:14:40.005 --> 00:14:42.860\nAnd if we indeed need a Big Brother,\n\n00:14:42.860 --> 00:14:46.338\nI would much rather have a domestic Big Brother\n\n00:14:46.338 --> 00:14:49.498\nthan a foreign Big Brother.\n\n00:14:49.503 --> 00:14:54.562\nAnd when the leaks started,\nthe very first thing I tweeted about this\n\n00:14:54.562 --> 00:14:56.636\nwas a comment about how,\n\n00:14:56.636 --> 00:14:58.324\nwhen you've been using search engines,\n\n00:14:58.324 --> 00:15:01.973\nyou've been potentially leaking all that\nto U.S. intelligence.\n\n00:15:01.973 --> 00:15:03.945\nAnd two minutes later, I got a reply\n\n00:15:03.945 --> 00:15:06.281\nby somebody called Kimberly from the United States\n\n00:15:06.281 --> 00:15:08.448\nchallenging me, like, why am I worried about this?\n\n00:15:08.461 --> 00:15:12.493\nWhat am I sending to worry about this?\nAm I sending naked pictures or something?\n\n00:15:12.493 --> 00:15:14.461\nAnd my answer to Kimberly was\n\n00:15:14.461 --> 00:15:17.490\nthat what I'm sending is none of your business,\n\n00:15:17.490 --> 00:15:21.755\nand it should be none\nof your government's business either.\n\n00:15:21.755 --> 00:15:24.007\nBecause that's what it's about.

Essentially, for three reasons: calculation, application, and last, and unfortunately least in terms of the time we give it, inspiration.Mathematics is the science of patterns, and we study it to learn how to think logically, critically and creatively, but too much of the mathematics that we learn in school is not effectively motivated, and when our students ask, \"Why are we learning this?\" then they often hear that they'll need it in an upcoming math class or on a future test. But wouldn't it be great if every once in a while we did mathematics simply because it was fun or beautiful or because it excited the mind? Now, I know many people have not had the opportunity to see how this can happen, so let me give you a quick example with my favorite collection of numbers, the Fibonacci numbers. (Applause)Yeah! I already have Fibonacci fans here. That's great.Now these numbers can be appreciated in many different ways. From the standpoint of calculation, they're as easy to understand as one plus one, which is two. Then one plus two is three, two plus three is five, three plus five is eight, and so on. Indeed, the person we call Fibonacci was actually named Leonardo of Pisa, and these numbers appear in his book \"Liber Abaci,\" which taught the Western world the methods of arithmetic that we use today. In terms of applications, Fibonacci numbers appear in nature surprisingly often. The number of petals on a flower is typically a Fibonacci number, or the number of spirals on a sunflower or a pineapple tends to be a Fibonacci number as well.In fact, there are many more applications of Fibonacci numbers, but what I find most inspirational about them are the beautiful number patterns they display. Let me show you one of my favorites. Suppose you like to square numbers, and frankly, who doesn't? (Laughter)Let's look at the squares of the first few Fibonacci numbers. So one squared is one, two squared is four, three squared is nine, five squared is 25, and so on. Now, it's no surprise that when you add consecutive Fibonacci numbers, you get the next Fibonacci number. Right? That's how they're created. But you wouldn't expect anything special to happen when you add the squares together. But check this out. One plus one gives us two, and one plus four gives us five. And four plus nine is 13, nine plus 25 is 34, and yes, the pattern continues.In fact, here's another one. Suppose you wanted to look at adding the squares of the first few Fibonacci numbers. Let's see what we get there. So one plus one plus four is six. Add nine to that, we get 15. Add 25, we get 40. Add 64, we get 104. Now look at those numbers. Those are not Fibonacci numbers, but if you look at them closely, you'll see the Fibonacci numbers buried inside of them.Do you see it? I'll show it to you. Six is two times three, 15 is three times five, 40 is five times eight, two, three, five, eight, who do we appreciate?(Laughter)Fibonacci! Of course.Now, as much fun as it is to discover these patterns, it's even more satisfying to understand why they are true. Let's look at that last equation. Why should the squares of one, one, two, three, five and eight add up to eight times 13? I'll show you by drawing a simple picture. We'll start with a one-by-one square and next to that put another one-by-one square. Together, they form a one-by-two rectangle. Beneath that, I'll put a two-by-two square, and next to that, a three-by-three square, beneath that, a five-by-five square, and then an eight-by-eight square, creating one giant rectangle, right?Now let me ask you a simple question: what is the area of the rectangle? Well, on the one hand, it's the sum of the areas of the squares inside it, right? Just as we created it. It's one squared plus one squared plus two squared plus three squared plus five squared plus eight squared. Right? That's the area. On the other hand, because it's a rectangle, the area is equal to its height times its base, and the height is clearly eight, and the base is five plus eight, which is the next Fibonacci number, 13. Right? So the area is also eight times 13. Since we've correctly calculated the area two different ways, they have to be the same number, and that's why the squares of one, one, two, three, five and eight add up to eight times 13.Now, if we continue this process, we'll generate rectangles of the form 13 by 21, 21 by 34, and so on.Now check this out. If you divide 13 by eight, you get 1.625. And if you divide the larger number by the smaller number, then these ratios get closer and closer to about 1.618, known to many people as the Golden Ratio, a number which has fascinated mathematicians, scientists and artists for centuries.Now, I show all this to you because, like so much of mathematics, there's a beautiful side to it that I fear does not get enough attention in our schools. We spend lots of time learning about calculation, but let's not forget about application, including, perhaps, the most important application of all, learning how to think.If I could summarize this in one sentence, it would be this: Mathematics is not just solving for x, it's also figuring out why.Thank you very much.(Applause)", "id": 1862, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:12.571 --> 00:00:15.610\nSo why do we learn mathematics?\n\n00:00:15.610 --> 00:00:18.158\nEssentially, for three reasons:\n\n00:00:18.158 --> 00:00:19.786\ncalculation,\n\n00:00:19.786 --> 00:00:21.686\napplication,\n\n00:00:21.686 --> 00:00:24.373\nand last, and unfortunately least\n\n00:00:24.373 --> 00:00:26.478\nin terms of the time we give it,\n\n00:00:26.478 --> 00:00:28.400\ninspiration.\n\n00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:30.672\nMathematics is the science of patterns,\n\n00:00:30.672 --> 00:00:34.030\nand we study it to learn how to think logically,\n\n00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:36.557\ncritically and creatively,\n\n00:00:36.557 --> 00:00:39.483\nbut too much of the mathematics\nthat we learn in school\n\n00:00:39.483 --> 00:00:41.802\nis not effectively motivated,\n\n00:00:41.802 --> 00:00:43.227\nand when our students ask,\n\n00:00:43.227 --> 00:00:44.902\n\"Why are we learning this?\"\n\n00:00:44.902 --> 00:00:46.863\nthen they often hear that they'll need it\n\n00:00:46.863 --> 00:00:50.128\nin an upcoming math class or on a future test.\n\n00:00:50.128 --> 00:00:51.930\nBut wouldn't it be great\n\n00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:54.448\nif every once in a while we did mathematics\n\n00:00:54.448 --> 00:00:57.397\nsimply because it was fun or beautiful\n\n00:00:57.397 --> 00:00:59.487\nor because it excited the mind?\n\n00:00:59.487 --> 00:01:01.209\nNow, I know many people have not\n\n00:01:01.209 --> 00:01:03.528\nhad the opportunity to see how this can happen,\n\n00:01:03.528 --> 00:01:05.357\nso let me give you a quick example\n\n00:01:05.357 --> 00:01:07.698\nwith my favorite collection of numbers,\n\n00:01:07.698 --> 00:01:10.426\nthe Fibonacci numbers.

At the time, these words were earmarked and targeted against the British, but over the last 200 years, they've come to embody what many Westerners believe, that freedom is the most cherished value, and that the best systems of politics and economics have freedom embedded in them. Who could blame them? Over the past hundred years, the combination of liberal democracy and private capitalism has helped to catapult the United States and Western countries to new levels of economic development. In the United States over the past hundred years, incomes have increased 30 times, and hundreds of thousands of people have been moved out of poverty. Meanwhile, American ingenuity and innovation has helped to spur industrialization and also helped in the creation and the building of things like household appliances such as refrigerators and televisions, motor vehicles and even the mobile phones in your pockets. It's no surprise, then, that even at the depths of the private capitalism crisis, President Obama said, \"The question before us is not whether the market is a force for good or ill. Its power to generate wealth and to expand freedom is unmatched.\" Thus, there's understandably a deep-seated presumption among Westerners that the whole world will decide to adopt private capitalism as the model of economic growth, liberal democracy, and will continue to prioritize political rights over economic rights.However, to many who live in the emerging markets, this is an illusion, and even though the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which was signed in 1948, was unanimously adopted, what it did was to mask a schism that has emerged between developed and developing countries, and the ideological beliefs between political and economic rights. This schism has only grown wider. Today, many people who live in the emerging markets, where 90 percent of the world's population lives, believe that the Western obsession with political rights is beside the point, and what is actually important is delivering on food, shelter, education and healthcare. \"Give me liberty or give me death\" is all well and good if you can afford it, but if you're living on less than one dollar a day, you're far too busy trying to survive and to provide for your family than to spend your time going around trying to proclaim and defend democracy.Now, I know many people in this room and around the world will think, \"Well actually, this is hard to grasp,\" because private capitalism and liberal democracy are held sacrosanct. But I ask you today, what would you do if you had to choose? What if you had to choose between a roof over your head and the right to vote?Over the last 10 years, I've had the privilege to travel to over 60 countries, many of them in the emerging markets, in Latin America, Asia, and my own continent of Africa. I've met with presidents, dissidents, policymakers, lawyers, teachers, doctors and the man on the street, and through these conversations, it's become clear to me that many people in the emerging markets believe that there's actually a split occurring between what people believe ideologically in terms of politics and economics in the West and that which people believe in the rest of the world.Now, don't get me wrong. I'm not saying people in the emerging markets don't understand democracy, nor am I saying that they wouldn't ideally like to pick their presidents or their leaders. Of course they would. However, I am saying that on balance, they worry more about where their living standard improvements are going to come from, and how it is their governments can deliver for them, than whether or not the government was elected by democracy.The fact of the matter is that this has become a very poignant question because there is for the first time in a long time a real challenge to the Western ideological systems of politics and economics, and this is a system that is embodied by China. And rather than have private capitalism, they have state capitalism. Instead of liberal democracy, they have de-prioritized the democratic system. And they have also decided to prioritize economic rights over political rights. I put it to you today that it is this system that is embodied by China that is gathering momentum amongst people in the emerging markets as the system to follow, because they believe increasingly that it is the system that will promise the best and fastest improvements in living standards in the shortest period of time. If you will indulge me, I will spend a few moments explaining to you first why economically they've come to this belief.First of all, it's China's economic performance over the past 30 years. She's been able to produce record economic growth and meaningfully move many people out of poverty, specifically putting a meaningful dent in poverty by moving over 300 million people out of indigence. It's not just in economics, but it's also in terms of living standards. We see that in China, 28 percent of people had secondary school access. Today, it's closer to 82 percent. So in its totality, economic improvement has been quite significant.Second, China has been able to meaningfully improve its income inequality without changing the political construct. Today, the United States and China are the two leading economies in the world. They have vastly different political systems and different economic systems, one with private capitalism, another one broadly with state capitalism. However, these two countries have the identical GINI Coefficient, which is a measure of income equality. Perhaps what is more disturbing is that China's income equality has been improving in recent times, whereas that of the United States has been declining.Thirdly, people in the emerging markets look at China's amazing and legendary infrastructure rollout. This is not just about China building roads and ports and railways in her own country \u2014 she's been able to build 85,000 kilometers of road network in China and surpass that of the United States \u2014 but even if you look to places like Africa, China has been able to help tar the distance of Cape Town to Cairo, which is 9,000 miles, or three times the distance of New York to California. Now this is something that people can see and point to. Perhaps it's no surprise that in a 2007 Pew survey, when surveyed, Africans in 10 countries said they thought that the Chinese were doing amazing things to improve their livelihoods by wide margins, by as much as 98 percent.Finally, China is also providing innovative solutions to age-old social problems that the world faces. If you travel to Mogadishu, Mexico City or Mumbai, you find that dilapidated infrastructure and logistics continue to be a stumbling block to the delivery of medicine and healthcare in the rural areas. However, through a network of state-owned enterprises, the Chinese have been able to go into these rural areas, using their companies to help deliver on these healthcare solutions.Ladies and gentlemen, it's no surprise that around the world, people are pointing at what China is doing and saying, \"I like that. I want that. I want to be able to do what China's doing. That is the system that seems to work.\" I'm here to also tell you that there are lots of shifts occurring around what China is doing in the democratic stance. In particular, there is growing doubt among people in the emerging markets, when people now believe that democracy is no longer to be viewed as a prerequisite for economic growth. In fact, countries like Taiwan, Singapore, Chile, not just China, have shown that actually, it's economic growth that is a prerequisite for democracy. In a recent study, the evidence has shown that income is the greatest determinant of how long a democracy can last. The study found that if your per capita income is about 1,000 dollars a year, your democracy will last about eight and a half years. If your per capita income is between 2,000 and 4,000 dollars per year, then you're likely to only get 33 years of democracy. And only if your per capita income is above 6,000 dollars a year will you have democracy come hell or high water.What this is telling us is that we need to first establish a middle class that is able to hold the government accountable. But perhaps it's also telling us that we should be worried about going around the world and shoehorning democracy, because ultimately we run the risk of ending up with illiberal democracies, democracies that in some sense could be worse than the authoritarian governments that they seek to replace.The evidence around illiberal democracies is quite depressing. Freedom House finds that although 50 percent of the world's countries today are democratic, 70 percent of those countries are illiberal in the sense that people don't have free speech or freedom of movement. But also, we're finding from Freedom House in a study that they published last year that freedom has been on the decline every year for the past seven years.What this says is that for people like me who care about liberal democracy, is we've got to find a more sustainable way of ensuring that we have a sustainable form of democracy in a liberal way, and that has its roots in economics. But it also says that as China moves toward being the largest economy in the world, something that is expected to happen by experts in 2016, that this schism between the political and economic ideologies of the West and the rest is likely to widen.What might that world look like? Well, the world could look like more state involvement and state capitalism; greater protectionisms of nation-states; but also, as I just pointed out a moment ago, ever-declining political rights and individual rights.The question that is left for us in general is, what then should the West be doing? And I suggest that they have two options. The West can either compete or cooperate. If the West chooses to compete with the Chinese model, and in effect go around the world and continue to try and push an agenda of private capitalism and liberal democracy, this is basically going against headwinds, but it also would be a natural stance for the West to take because in many ways it is the antithesis of the Chinese model of de-prioritizing democracy, and state capitalism. Now the fact of the matter is, if the West decides to compete, it will create a wider schism. The other option is for the West to cooperate, and by cooperating I mean giving the emerging market countries the flexibility to figure out in an organic way what political and economic system works best for them.Now I'm sure some of you in the room will be thinking, well, this is like ceding to China, and this is a way, in other words, for the West to take a back seat. But I put it to you that if the United States and European countries want to remain globally influential, they may have to consider cooperating in the short term in order to compete, and by that, they might have to focus more aggressively on economic outcomes to help create the middle class and therefore be able to hold government accountable and create the democracies that we really want.The fact of the matter is that instead of going around the world and haranguing countries for engaging with China, the West should be encouraging its own businesses to trade and invest in these regions. Instead of criticizing China for bad behavior, the West should be showing how it is that their own system of politics and economics is the superior one. And instead of shoehorning democracy around the world, perhaps the West should take a leaf out of its own history book and remember that it takes a lot of patience in order to develop the models and the systems that you have today. Indeed, the Supreme Court Justice Stephen Breyer reminds us that it took the United States nearly 170 years from the time that the Constitution was written for there to be equal rights in the United States. Some people would argue that today there is still no equal rights. In fact, there are groups who would argue that they still do not have equal rights under the law.At its very best, the Western model speaks for itself. It's the model that put food on the table. It's the refrigerators. It put a man on the moon. But the fact of the matter is, although people back in the day used to point at the Western countries and say, \"I want that, I like that,\" there's now a new person in town in the form of a country, China. Today, generations are looking at China and saying, \"China can produce infrastructure, China can produce economic growth, and we like that.\"Because ultimately, the question before us, and the question before seven billion people on the planet is, how can we create prosperity? People who care and will pivot towards the model of politics and economics in a very rational way, to those models that will ensure that they can have better living standards in the shortest period of time.As you leave here today, I would like to leave you with a very personal message, which is what it is that I believe we should be doing as individuals, and this is really about being open-minded, open-minded to the fact that our hopes and dreams of creating prosperity for people around the world, creating and meaningfully putting a dent in poverty for hundreds of millions of people, has to be based in being open-minded, because these systems have good things and they have bad things.Just to illustrate, I went into my annals of myself. That's a picture of me.Awww. (Laughter)I was born and raised in Zambia in 1969. At the time of my birth, blacks were not issued birth certificates, and that law only changed in 1973. This is an affidavit from the Zambian government. I bring this to you to tell you that in 40 years, I've gone from not being recognized as a human being to standing in front of the illustrious TED crowd today to talk to you about my views. In this vein, we can increase economic growth. We can meaningfully put a dent in poverty. But also, it's going to require that we look at our assumptions, assumptions and strictures that we've grown up with around democracy, around private capitalism, around what creates economic growth and reduces poverty and creates freedoms. We might have to tear those books up and start to look at other options and be open-minded to seek the truth. Ultimately, it's about transforming the world and making it a better place.Thank you very much.(Applause)", "id": 1842, "subtitle":

emerging markets\n\n00:03:52.305 --> 00:03:55.514\nbelieve that there's actually a split occurring\n\n00:03:55.514 --> 00:03:58.280\nbetween what people believe ideologically\n\n00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:00.966\nin terms of politics and economics in the West\n\n00:04:00.966 --> 00:04:03.850\nand that which people believe in the rest of the world.\n\n00:04:03.850 --> 00:04:05.721\nNow, don't get me wrong.\n\n00:04:05.721 --> 00:04:07.181\nI'm not saying people in the emerging markets\n\n00:04:07.181 --> 00:04:09.272\ndon't understand democracy,\n\n00:04:09.272 --> 00:04:11.181\nnor am I saying that they wouldn't ideally\n\n00:04:11.181 --> 00:04:13.666\nlike to pick their presidents or their leaders.\n\n00:04:13.666 --> 00:04:15.221\nOf course they would.\n\n00:04:15.221 --> 00:04:18.242\nHowever, I am saying that on balance,\n\n00:04:18.242 --> 00:04:19.824\nthey worry more about\n\n00:04:19.824 --> 00:04:22.855\nwhere their living standard improvements are going to come from,\n\n00:04:22.855 --> 00:04:25.138\nand how it is their governments can deliver for them,\n\n00:04:25.138 --> 00:04:27.043\nthan whether or not the government\n\n00:04:27.043 --> 00:04:29.983\nwas elected by democracy.\n\n00:04:29.983 --> 00:04:32.072\nThe fact of the matter\n\n00:04:32.072 --> 00:04:34.537\nis that this has become a very poignant question\n\n00:04:34.537 --> 00:04:36.870\nbecause there is for the first time in a long time\n\n00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:40.440\na real challenge to the Western ideological systems\n\n00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:42.594\nof politics and

capitalism.\n\n00:04:49.645 --> 00:04:53.917\nInstead of liberal democracy,\nthey have de-prioritized the democratic system.\n\n00:04:53.917 --> 00:04:56.281\nAnd they have also decided to prioritize\n\n00:04:56.281 --> 00:04:59.938\neconomic rights over political rights.\n\n00:04:59.938 --> 00:05:02.787\nI put it to you today that it is this system\n\n00:05:02.787 --> 00:05:04.632\nthat is embodied by China\n\n00:05:04.632 --> 00:05:06.592\nthat is gathering momentum amongst people\n\n00:05:06.592 --> 00:05:09.680\nin the emerging markets as the system to follow,\n\n00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:11.700\nbecause they believe increasingly\n\n00:05:11.700 --> 00:05:13.375\nthat it is the system\n\n00:05:13.375 --> 00:05:16.776\nthat will promise the best and fastest improvements\n\n00:05:16.776 --> 00:05:20.387\nin living standards in the shortest period of time.\n\n00:05:20.387 --> 00:05:22.966\nIf you will indulge me, I will spend a few moments\n\n00:05:22.966 --> 00:05:24.788\nexplaining to you first\n\n00:05:24.788 --> 00:05:28.818\nwhy economically they've come to this belief.\n\n00:05:28.818 --> 00:05:31.644\nFirst of all, it's China's economic performance\n\n00:05:31.644 --> 00:05:33.686\nover the past 30 years.\n\n00:05:33.686 --> 00:05:36.406\nShe's been able to produce record economic growth\n\n00:05:36.406 --> 00:05:40.041\nand meaningfully move many people out of poverty,\n\n00:05:40.041 --> 00:05:43.220\nspecifically putting a meaningful dent in poverty\n\n00:05:43.220 --> 00:05:46.034\nby moving over 300 million people\n\n00:05:46.034 --> 00:05:49.292\nout of indigence.\n\n00:05:49.292 --> 00:05:51.806\nIt's not just in economics,\n\n00:05:51.806 --> 00:05:54.303\nbut it's also in terms of living standards.\n\n00:05:54.303 --> 00:05:57.147\nWe see that in China, 28 percent of people\n\n00:05:57.147 --> 00:05:58.970\nhad secondary school access.\n\n00:05:58.970 --> 00:06:01.347\nToday, it's closer to 82 percent.\n\n00:06:01.347 --> 00:06:03.942\nSo in its totality, economic improvement\n\n00:06:03.942 --> 00:06:06.638\nhas been quite significant.\n\n00:06:06.638 --> 00:06:09.674\nSecond, China has been able\n\n00:06:09.674 --> 00:06:12.810\nto meaningfully improve its income inequality\n\n00:06:12.810 --> 00:06:15.475\nwithout changing the political construct.\n\n00:06:15.475 --> 00:06:17.905\nToday, the United States and China\n\n00:06:17.905 --> 00:06:20.431\nare the two leading economies in the world.\n\n00:06:20.431 --> 00:06:22.680\nThey have vastly different political systems\n\n00:06:22.680 --> 00:06:25.002\nand different economic systems,\n\n00:06:25.002 --> 00:06:26.472\none with private capitalism,\n\n00:06:26.472 --> 00:06:28.911\nanother one broadly with state capitalism.\n\n00:06:28.911 --> 00:06:30.984\nHowever, these two countries\n\n00:06:30.984 --> 00:06:33.091\nhave the identical GINI Coefficient,\n\n00:06:33.091 --> 00:06:35.638\nwhich is a measure of income equality.\n\n00:06:35.638 --> 00:06:37.870\nPerhaps what is more disturbing\n\n00:06:37.870 --> 00:06:39.964\nis that China's income equality\n\n00:06:39.964 --> 00:06:42.285\nhas been improving in recent times,\n\n00:06:42.285 --> 00:06:43.902\nwhereas that of the United States\n\n00:06:43.902 --> 00:06:46.965\nhas been declining.\n\n00:06:46.965 --> 00:06:49.521\nThirdly, people in the emerging markets\n\n00:06:49.521 --> 00:06:51.915\nlook at China's amazing and legendary\n\n00:06:51.915 --> 00:06:54.241\ninfrastructure rollout.\n\n00:06:54.241 --> 00:06:55.900\nThis is not just about China\n\n00:06:55.900 --> 00:06:58.260\nbuilding roads and ports and railways\n\n00:06:58.260 --> 00:06:59.696\nin her own country --\n\n00:06:59.696 --> 00:07:02.784\nshe's been

00:07:10.134\nbut even if you look to places like Africa,\n\n00:07:10.134 --> 00:07:13.191\nChina has been able to help tar the distance\n\n00:07:13.191 --> 00:07:14.845\nof Cape Town to Cairo,\n\n00:07:14.845 --> 00:07:16.470\nwhich is 9,000 miles,\n\n00:07:16.470 --> 00:07:20.381\nor three times the distance of New York to California.\n\n00:07:20.381 --> 00:07:24.821\nNow this is something that people can see and point to.\n\n00:07:24.821 --> 00:07:26.503\nPerhaps it's no surprise\n\n00:07:26.503 --> 00:07:30.224\nthat in a 2007 Pew survey, when surveyed,\n\n00:07:30.224 --> 00:07:32.092\nAfricans in 10 countries said\n\n00:07:32.092 --> 00:07:33.760\nthey thought that the Chinese were doing\n\n00:07:33.760 --> 00:07:35.654\namazing things to improve their livelihoods\n\n00:07:35.654 --> 00:07:40.152\nby wide margins, by as much as 98 percent.\n\n00:07:40.152 --> 00:07:44.672\nFinally, China is also providing innovative solutions\n\n00:07:44.672 --> 00:07:48.043\nto age-old social problems that the world faces.\n\n00:07:48.043 --> 00:07:51.311\nIf you travel to Mogadishu, Mexico City or Mumbai,\n\n00:07:51.311 --> 00:07:54.563\nyou find that dilapidated infrastructure and logistics\n\n00:07:54.563 --> 00:07:56.790\ncontinue to be a stumbling block\n\n00:07:56.790 --> 00:07:58.891\nto the delivery of medicine and healthcare\n\n00:07:58.891 --> 00:08:00.761\nin the rural areas.\n\n00:08:00.761 --> 00:08:03.639\nHowever, through a network of state-owned enterprises,\n\n00:08:03.639 --> 00:08:06.535\nthe Chinese have been able to go into these rural areas,\n\n00:08:06.535 --> 00:08:08.025\nusing their companies\n\n00:08:08.025 --> 00:08:11.297\nto help deliver on these healthcare solutions.\n\n00:08:11.297 --> 00:08:13.503\nLadies and gentlemen, it's no surprise\n\n00:08:13.503 --> 00:08:16.753\nthat around the world, people are pointing\nat what China is doing and saying,\n\n00:08:16.753 --> 00:08:18.895\n\"I like that. I want that.\n\n00:08:18.895 --> 00:08:21.089\nI want to be able to do what China's doing.\n\n00:08:21.089 --> 00:08:23.859\nThat is the system that seems to work.\"\n\n00:08:23.859 --> 00:08:25.532\nI'm here to also tell you\n\n00:08:25.532 --> 00:08:27.279\nthat there are lots of shifts occurring\n\n00:08:27.279 --> 00:08:29.239\naround what China is doing\n\n00:08:29.239 --> 00:08:31.314\nin the democratic stance.\n\n00:08:31.314 --> 00:08:33.979\nIn particular, there is growing doubt\n\n00:08:33.979 --> 00:08:36.081\namong people in the emerging markets,\n\n00:08:36.081 --> 00:08:37.788\nwhen people now believe that democracy\n\n00:08:37.788 --> 00:08:40.072\nis no longer to be viewed\n\n00:08:40.072 --> 00:08:43.555\nas a prerequisite for economic growth.\n\n00:08:43.555 --> 00:08:47.796\nIn fact, countries like Taiwan, Singapore, Chile,\n\n00:08:47.796 --> 00:08:50.704\nnot just China, have shown that actually,\n\n00:08:50.704 --> 00:08:53.390\nit's economic growth that is a prerequisite\n\n00:08:53.390 --> 00:08:55.154\nfor democracy.\n\n00:08:55.154 --> 00:08:58.400\nIn a recent study, the evidence has shown\n\n00:08:58.400 --> 00:09:00.898\nthat income is the greatest determinant\n\n00:09:00.898 --> 00:09:03.646\nof how long a democracy can last.\n\n00:09:03.646 --> 00:09:06.379\nThe study found that if your per capita income\n\n00:09:06.379 --> 00:09:08.591\nis about 1,000 dollars a year,\n\n00:09:08.591 --> 00:09:11.589\nyour democracy will last about eight and a half years.\n\n00:09:11.589 --> 00:09:13.307\nIf your per capita income is between\n\n00:09:13.307 --> 00:09:15.707\n2,000 and 4,000 dollars per year,\n\n00:09:15.707 --> 00:09:18.749\nthen you're likely to only get 33 years of democracy.\n\n00:09:18.749 --> 00:09:20.573\nAnd only if your per capita income\n\n00:09:20.573 --> 00:09:22.704\nis above 6,000 dollars a year\n\n00:09:22.704 --> 00:09:26.448\nwill you have democracy come hell or high water.\n\n00:09:26.448 --> 00:09:28.160\nWhat this is telling us\n\n00:09:28.160 --> 00:09:30.733\nis that we need to first establish a middle class\n\n00:09:30.733 --> 00:09:33.850\nthat is able to hold the government accountable.\n\n00:09:33.850 --> 00:09:36.225\nBut perhaps it's also telling us\n\n00:09:36.225 --> 00:09:37.807\nthat we should be worried about going\n\n00:09:37.807 --> 00:09:40.717\naround the world and shoehorning democracy,\n\n00:09:40.717 --> 00:09:42.527\nbecause ultimately we run the risk\n\n00:09:42.527 --> 00:09:44.657\nof ending up with illiberal democracies,\n\n00:09:44.657 --> 00:09:46.718\ndemocracies that in some sense\n\n00:09:46.718 --> 00:09:48.885\ncould be worse than the authoritarian governments\n\n00:09:48.885 --> 00:09:52.572\nthat they seek to replace.\n\n00:09:52.572 --> 00:09:54.838\nThe evidence around illiberal democracies\n\n00:09:54.838 --> 00:09:56.658\nis quite depressing.\n\n00:09:56.658 --> 00:09:59.104\nFreedom House finds that although 50 percent\n\n00:09:59.104 --> 00:10:02.261\nof the world's countries today are democratic,\n\n00:10:02.261 --> 00:10:04.967\n70 percent of those countries are illiberal\n\n00:10:04.967 --> 00:10:07.320\nin the sense that people don't have free speech\n\n00:10:07.320 --> 00:10:10.065\nor freedom of movement.\n\n00:10:10.065 --> 00:10:12.384\nBut also, we're finding from Freedom House\n\n00:10:12.384 --> 00:10:14.505\nin a study that they published last year\n\n00:10:14.505 --> 00:10:16.620\nthat freedom has been on the decline\n\n00:10:16.620 --> 00:10:19.192\nevery year for the past seven years.\n\n00:10:19.192 --> 00:10:20.976\nWhat this says\n\n00:10:20.976 --> 00:10:22.314\nis that for people like me\n\n00:10:22.314 --> 00:10:24.924\nwho care about liberal democracy,\n\n00:10:24.924 --> 00:10:27.271\nis we've got to find a more sustainable way\n\n00:10:27.271 --> 00:10:29.616\nof ensuring that we have a sustainable form\n\n00:10:29.616 --> 00:10:31.817\nof democracy in a liberal way,\n\n00:10:31.817 --> 00:10:34.817\nand that has its roots in economics.\n\n00:10:34.817 --> 00:10:37.746\nBut it also says that as China moves\n\n00:10:37.746 --> 00:10:40.278\ntoward being the largest economy in the world,\n\n00:10:40.278 --> 00:10:42.299\nsomething that is expected to happen\n\n00:10:42.299 --> 00:10:44.374\nby experts in 2016,\n\n00:10:44.374 --> 00:10:46.644\nthat this schism between the political\n\n00:10:46.644 --> 00:10:50.006\nand economic ideologies of the West and the rest\n\n00:10:50.006 --> 00:10:52.937\nis likely to widen.\n\n00:10:52.937 --> 00:10:55.492\nWhat might that world look like?\n\n00:10:55.492 --> 00:10:57.054\nWell, the world could look like\n\n00:10:57.054 --> 00:11:00.319\nmore state involvement and state capitalism;\n\n00:11:00.319 --> 00:11:03.158\ngreater protectionisms of nation-states;\n\n00:11:03.158 --> 00:11:05.667\nbut also, as I just pointed out a moment ago,\n\n00:11:05.667 --> 00:11:07.834\never-declining political rights\n\n00:11:07.834 --> 00:11:09.895\nand individual rights.\n\n00:11:09.895 --> 00:11:12.657\nThe question that is left for us in general\n\n00:11:12.657 --> 00:11:15.773\nis, what then should the West be doing?\n\n00:11:15.773 --> 00:11:18.478\nAnd I suggest that they have two options.\n\n00:11:18.478 --> 00:11:22.895\nThe West can either compete or cooperate.\n\n00:11:22.895 --> 00:11:26.083\nIf the West chooses to compete with the Chinese model,\n\n00:11:26.083 --> 00:11:28.090\nand in effect go around the world\n\n00:11:28.090 --> 00:11:30.417\nand continue to try and push an agenda\n\n00:11:30.417 --> 00:11:33.457\nof private capitalism and liberal democracy,\n\n00:11:33.457 --> 00:11:36.113\nthis is basically going against headwinds,\n\n00:11:36.113 --> 00:11:38.137\nbut it also would be a natural stance\n\n00:11:38.137 --> 00:11:39.598\nfor the West to take\n\n00:11:39.598 --> 00:11:41.631\nbecause in many ways it is the antithesis\n\n00:11:41.631 --> 00:11:43.778\nof the Chinese model\n\n00:11:43.778 --> 00:11:47.906\nof de-prioritizing democracy, and state capitalism.\n\n00:11:47.906 --> 00:11:49.685\nNow the fact of the matter is,\n\n00:11:49.685 --> 00:11:51.643\nif the West decides to compete,\n\n00:11:51.643 --> 00:11:55.041\nit will create a wider schism.\n\n00:11:55.041 --> 00:11:57.894\nThe other option is for the West to cooperate,\n\n00:11:57.894 --> 00:11:59.488\nand by cooperating I mean\n\n00:11:59.488 --> 00:12:02.998\ngiving the emerging market countries the flexibility\n\n00:12:02.998 --> 00:12:05.045\nto figure out in an organic way\n\n00:12:05.045 --> 00:12:06.807\nwhat political and economic system\n\n00:12:06.807 --> 00:12:08.500\nworks best for them.\n\n00:12:08.500 --> 00:12:10.230\nNow I'm sure some of you in the room\n\n00:12:10.230 --> 00:12:13.104\nwill be thinking, well, this is like ceding to China,\n\n00:12:13.104 --> 00:12:15.175\nand this is a way, in other words,\n\n00:12:15.175 --> 00:12:17.087\nfor the West to take a back seat.\n\n00:12:17.087 --> 00:12:18.542\nBut I put it to you\n\n00:12:18.542 --> 00:12:20.892\nthat if the United States and European countries\n\n00:12:20.892 --> 00:12:23.543\nwant to remain globally influential,\n\n00:12:23.543 --> 00:12:25.413\nthey may have to consider cooperating\n\n00:12:25.413 --> 00:12:27.962\nin the short term in order to compete,\n\n00:12:27.962 --> 00:12:30.205\nand by that, they might have to focus\n\n00:12:30.205 --> 00:12:33.440\nmore aggressively on economic outcomes\n\n00:12:33.440 --> 00:12:35.149\nto help create the middle class\n\n00:12:35.149 --> 00:12:37.820\nand therefore be able to hold government accountable\n\n00:12:37.820 --> 00:12:41.847\nand create the democracies that we really want.\n\n00:12:41.847 --> 00:12:44.436\nThe fact of the matter is that\n\n00:12:44.436 --> 00:12:46.339\ninstead of going around the world\n\n00:12:46.339 --> 00:12:49.826\nand haranguing countries for engaging with China,\n\n00:12:49.826 --> 00:12:52.786\nthe West should be encouraging its own businesses\n\n00:12:52.786 --> 00:12:55.285\nto trade and invest in these regions.\n\n00:12:55.285 --> 00:12:59.537\nInstead of criticizing China for bad behavior,\n\n00:12:59.537 --> 00:13:02.137\nthe West should be showing how it is\n\n00:13:02.137 --> 00:13:04.524\nthat their own system of politics and economics\n\n00:13:04.524 --> 00:13:06.674\nis the superior one.\n\n00:13:06.674 --> 00:13:08.694\nAnd instead of shoehorning democracy\n\n00:13:08.694 --> 00:13:10.185\naround the world,\n\n00:13:10.185 --> 00:13:11.460\nperhaps the West should take a leaf\n\n00:13:11.460 --> 00:13:13.312\nout of its own history book\n\n00:13:13.312 --> 00:13:16.162\nand remember that it takes a lot of patience\n\n00:13:16.162 --> 00:13:17.732\nin order to develop the models\n\n00:13:17.732 --> 00:13:20.065\nand the systems that you have today.\n\n00:13:20.065 --> 00:13:23.537\nIndeed, the Supreme Court Justice Stephen Breyer\n\n00:13:23.537 --> 00:13:26.166\nreminds us that it took the United States\n\n00:13:26.166 --> 00:13:28.812\nnearly 170 years\n\n00:13:28.812 --> 00:13:31.481\nfrom the time that the Constitution was written\n\n00:13:31.481 --> 00:13:34.441\nfor there to be equal rights in the United States.\n\n00:13:34.441 --> 00:13:35.803\nSome people would argue that today\n\n00:13:35.803 --> 00:13:37.317\nthere is still no equal rights.\n\n00:13:37.317 --> 00:13:39.163\nIn fact, there are groups who would argue\n\n00:13:39.163 --> 00:13:44.491\nthat they still do not have equal rights under the law.\n\n00:13:44.491 --> 00:13:46.073\nAt its very best,\n\n00:13:46.073 --> 00:13:48.325\nthe Western model speaks for itself.\n\n00:13:48.325 --> 00:13:50.486\nIt's the model that put food on the table.\n\n00:13:50.486 --> 00:13:52.077\nIt's the refrigerators.\n\n00:13:52.077 --> 00:13:54.109\nIt put a man on the moon.\n\n00:13:54.109 --> 00:13:55.899\nBut the fact of the matter is,\n\n00:13:55.899 --> 00:13:57.549\nalthough people back in the day\n\n00:13:57.549 --> 00:13:59.615\nused to point at the Western countries and say,\n\n00:13:59.615 --> 00:14:01.658\n\"I want that, I like that,\"\n\n00:14:01.658 --> 00:14:03.817\nthere's now a new person in town\n\n00:14:03.817 --> 00:14:06.256\nin the form of a country, China.\n\n00:14:06.256 --> 00:14:08.342\nToday, generations are looking at China\n\n00:14:08.342 --> 00:14:10.982\nand saying, \"China can produce infrastructure,\n\n00:14:10.982 --> 00:14:13.098\nChina can produce economic growth,\n\n00:14:13.098 --> 00:14:14.666\nand we like that.\"\n\n00:14:14.666 --> 00:14:17.380\nBecause ultimately, the question before us,\n\n00:14:17.380 --> 00:14:19.236\nand the question before\n\n00:14:19.236 --> 00:14:20.941\nseven billion people on the planet\n\n00:14:20.941 --> 00:14:24.041\nis, how can we create prosperity?\n\n00:14:24.041 --> 00:14:26.956\nPeople who care and will pivot towards the

ensure\n\n00:14:32.513 --> 00:14:34.494\nthat they can have better living standards\n\n00:14:34.494 --> 00:14:37.117\nin the shortest period of time.\n\n00:14:37.117 --> 00:14:38.828\nAs you leave here today,\n\n00:14:38.828 --> 00:14:40.233\nI would like to leave you\n\n00:14:40.233 --> 00:14:41.886\nwith a very personal message,\n\n00:14:41.886 --> 00:14:43.972\nwhich is what it is that I believe\n\n00:14:43.972 --> 00:14:46.376\nwe should be doing as individuals,\n\n00:14:46.376 --> 00:14:49.745\nand this is really about being open-minded,\n\n00:14:49.745 --> 00:14:53.084\nopen-minded to the fact that our hopes and dreams\n\n00:14:53.084 --> 00:14:56.319\nof creating prosperity for people around the world,\n\n00:14:56.319 --> 00:14:59.243\ncreating and meaningfully putting a dent

It was the winter of 2009, and I had been blind for about a year. Things were going pretty well. Safely reaching the other side, I turned to the left, pushed the auto-button for the audible pedestrian signal, and waited my turn. As it went off, I took off and safely got to the other side. Stepping onto the sidewalk, I then heard the sound of a steel chair slide across the concrete sidewalk in front of me. I know there's a cafe on the corner, and they have chairs out in front, so I just adjusted to the left to get closer to the street. As I did, so slid the chair. I just figured I'd made a mistake, and went back to the right, and so slid the chair in perfect synchronicity. Now I was getting a little anxious. I went back to the left, and so slid the chair, blocking my path of travel. Now, I was officially freaking out. So I yelled, \"Who the hell's out there? What's going on?\" Just then, over my shout, I heard something else, a familiar rattle. It sounded familiar, and I quickly considered another possibility, and I reached out with my left hand, as my fingers brushed against something fuzzy, and I came across an ear, the ear of a dog, perhaps a golden retriever. Its leash had been tied to the chair as her master went in for coffee, and she was just persistent in her efforts to greet me, perhaps get a scratch behind the ear. Who knows, maybe she was volunteering for service. (Laughter)But that little story is really about the fears and misconceptions that come along with the idea of moving through the city without sight, seemingly oblivious to the environment and the people around you.So let me step back and set the stage a little bit. On St. Patrick's Day of 2008, I reported to the hospital for surgery to remove a brain tumor. The surgery was successful. Two days later, my sight started to fail. On the third day, it was gone.Immediately, I was struck by an incredible sense of fear, of confusion, of vulnerability, like anybody would. But as I had time to stop and think, I actually started to realize I had a lot to be grateful for. In particular, I thought about my dad, who had passed away from complications from brain surgery. He was 36. I was seven at the time. So although I had every reason to be fearful of what was ahead, and had no clue quite what was going to happen, I was alive. My son still had his dad. And besides, it's not like I was the first person ever to lose their sight. I knew there had to be all sorts of systems and techniques and training to have to live a full and meaningful, active life without sight.So by the time I was discharged from the hospital a few days later, I left with a mission, a mission to get out and get the best training as quickly as I could and get on to rebuilding my life. Within six months, I had returned to work. My training had started. I even started riding a tandem bike with my old cycling buddies, and was commuting to work on my own, walking through town and taking the bus. It was a lot of hard work.But what I didn't anticipate through that rapid transition was the incredible experience of the juxtaposition of my sighted experience up against my unsighted experience of the same places and the same people within such a short period of time.From that came a lot of insights, or outsights, as I called them, things that I learned since losing my sight. These outsights ranged from the trival to the profound, from the mundane to the humorous. As an architect, that stark juxtaposition of my sighted and unsighted experience of the same places and the same cities within such a short period of time has given me all sorts of wonderful outsights of the city itself. Paramount amongst those was the realization that, actually, cities are fantastic places for the blind. And then I was also surprised by the city's propensity for kindness and care as opposed to indifference or worse. And then I started to realize that it seemed like the blind seemed to have a positive influence on the city itself. That was a little curious to me.Let me step back and take a look at why the city is so good for the blind. Inherent with the training for recovery from sight loss is learning to rely on all your non-visual senses, things that you would otherwise maybe ignore. It's like a whole new world of sensory information opens up to you. I was really struck by the symphony of subtle sounds all around me in the city that you can hear and work with to understand where you are, how you need to move, and where you need to go. Similarly, just through the grip of the cane, you can feel contrasting textures in the floor below, and over time you build a pattern of where you are and where you're headed. Similarly, just the sun warming one side of your face or the wind at your neck gives you clues about your alignment and your progression through a block and your movement through time and space. But also, the sense of smell. Some districts and cities have their own smell, as do places and things around you, and if you're lucky, you can even follow your nose to that new bakery that you've been looking for.All this really surprised me, because I started to realize that my unsighted experienced was so far more multi-sensory than my sighted experience ever was. What struck me also was how much the city was changing around me. When you're sighted, everybody kind of sticks to themselves, you mind your own business. Lose your sight, though, and it's a whole other story. And I don't know who's watching who, but I have a suspicion that a lot of people are watching me. And I'm not paranoid, but everywhere I go, I'm getting all sorts of advice: Go here, move there, watch out for this. A lot of the information is good. Some of it's helpful. A lot of it's kind of reversed. You've got to figure out what they actually meant. Some of it's kind of wrong and not helpful. But it's all good in the grand scheme of things.But one time I was in Oakland walking along Broadway, and came to a corner. I was waiting for an audible pedestrian signal, and as it went off, I was just about to step out into the street, when all of a sudden, my right hand was just gripped by this guy, and he yanked my arm and pulled me out into the crosswalk and was dragging me out across the street, speaking to me in Mandarin. (Laughter) It's like, there was no escape from this man's death grip, but he got me safely there. What could I do? But believe me, there are more polite ways to offer assistance. We don't know you're there, so it's kind of nice to say \"Hello\" first. \"Would you like some help?\"But while in Oakland, I've really been struck by how much the city of Oakland changed as I lost my sight. I liked it sighted. It was fine. It's a perfectly great city. But once I lost my sight and was walking along Broadway, I was blessed every block of the way.\"Bless you, man.\"\"Go for it, brother.\"\"God bless you.\"I didn't get that sighted. (Laughter) And even without sight, I don't get that in San Francisco. And I know it bothers some of my blind friends, it's not just me. Often it's thought that that's an emotion that comes up out of pity. I tend to think that it comes out of our shared humanity, out of our togetherness, and I think it's pretty cool. In fact, if I'm feeling down, I just go to Broadway in downtown Oakland, I go for a walk, and I feel better like that, in no time at all.But also that it illustrates how disability and blindness sort of cuts across ethnic, social, racial, economic lines. Disability is an equal-opportunity provider. Everybody's welcome. In fact, I've heard it said in the disability community that there are really only two types of people: There are those with disabilities, and there are those that haven't quite found theirs yet. It's a different way of thinking about it, but I think it's kind of beautiful, because it is certainly far more inclusive than the us-versus-them or the abled-versus-the-disabled, and it's a lot more honest and respectful of the fragility of life.So my final takeaway for you is that not only is the city good for the blind, but the city needs us. And I'm so sure of that that I want to propose to you today that the blind be taken as the prototypical city dwellers when imagining new and wonderful cities, and not the people that are thought about after the mold has already been cast. It's too late then. So if you design a city with the blind in mind, you'll have a rich, walkable network of sidewalks with a dense array of options and choices all available at the street level. If you design a city with the blind in mind, sidewalks will be predictable and will be generous. The space between buildings will be well-balanced between people and cars. In fact, cars, who needs them? If you're blind, you don't drive. (Laughter) They don't like it when you drive. (Laughter) If you design a city with the blind in mind, you design a city with a robust, accessible, well-connected mass transit system that connects all parts of the city and the region all around. If you design a city with the blind in mind, there'll be jobs, lots of jobs. Blind people want to work too. They want to earn a living.So, in designing a city for the blind, I hope you start to realize that it actually would be a more inclusive, a more equitable, a more just city for all. And based on my prior sighted experience, it sounds like a pretty cool city, whether you're blind, whether you have a disability, or you haven't quite found yours yet.So thank you.(Applause)", "id": 1863, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:15.128 --> 00:00:18.109\nSo, stepping down out of the bus,\n\n00:00:18.109 --> 00:00:19.854\nI headed back to the corner\n\n00:00:19.854 --> 00:00:23.242\nto head west en route to a braille training session.\n\n00:00:23.242 --> 00:00:25.352\nIt was the winter of 2009,\n\n00:00:25.352 --> 00:00:27.773\nand I had been blind for about a year.\n\n00:00:27.773 --> 00:00:29.906\nThings were going pretty well.\n\n00:00:29.906 --> 00:00:31.813\nSafely reaching the other side,\n\n00:00:31.813 --> 00:00:33.274\nI turned to the left,\n\n00:00:33.274 --> 00:00:35.878\npushed the auto-button for\nthe audible pedestrian signal,\n\n00:00:35.878 --> 00:00:37.802\nand waited my turn.\n\n00:00:37.802 --> 00:00:39.891\nAs it went off, I took off\n\n00:00:39.891 --> 00:00:41.564\nand safely got to the other side.\n\n00:00:41.564 --> 00:00:43.660\nStepping onto the sidewalk,\n\n00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:46.354\nI then heard the sound of a steel chair\n\n00:00:46.354 --> 00:00:50.510\nslide across the concrete sidewalk in front of me.\n\n00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:52.427\nI know there's a cafe on the corner,\n\n00:00:52.427 --> 00:00:54.073\nand they have chairs out in front,\n\n00:00:54.073 --> 00:00:55.469\nso I just adjusted to the left\n\n00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:57.313\nto get closer to the street.\n\n00:00:57.313 --> 00:01:00.953\nAs I did, so slid the chair.\n\n00:01:00.953 --> 00:01:03.034\nI just figured I'd made a mistake,\n\n00:01:03.034 --> 00:01:04.872\nand went back to the right,\n\n00:01:04.872 --> 00:01:08.367\nand so slid the chair in perfect synchronicity.\n\n00:01:08.367 --> 00:01:10.732\nNow I was getting a little anxious.\n\n00:01:10.732 --> 00:01:12.345\nI went back to the left,\n\n00:01:12.345 --> 00:01:13.634\nand so slid the chair,\n\n00:01:13.634 --> 00:01:16.242\nblocking my path of travel.\n\n00:01:16.242 --> 00:01:19.244\nNow, I was officially freaking out.\n\n00:01:19.244 --> 00:01:20.829\nSo I yelled,\n\n00:01:20.829 --> 00:01:24.090\n\"Who the hell's out there?

itself.\n\n00:05:08.700 --> 00:05:11.954\nThat was a little curious to me.\n\n00:05:11.954 --> 00:05:14.514\nLet me step back and take a look\n\n00:05:14.514 --> 00:05:19.876\nat why the city is so good for the blind.\n\n00:05:19.876 --> 00:05:23.498\nInherent with the training for recovery from sight loss\n\n00:05:23.498 --> 00:05:27.369\nis learning to rely on all your non-visual senses,\n\n00:05:27.369 --> 00:05:30.595\nthings that you would otherwise maybe ignore.\n\n00:05:30.595 --> 00:05:33.140\nIt's like a whole new world of sensory information\n\n00:05:33.140 --> 00:05:34.589\nopens up to you.\n\n00:05:34.589 --> 00:05:36.117\nI was really struck by the symphony\n\n00:05:36.117 --> 00:05:39.093\nof subtle sounds all around me in the city\n\n00:05:39.093 --> 00:05:40.385\nthat you can hear and work with\n\n00:05:40.385 --> 00:05:42.267\nto understand where you are,\n\n00:05:42.267 --> 00:05:45.072\nhow you need to move, and where you need to go.\n\n00:05:45.072 --> 00:05:47.796\nSimilarly, just through the grip of the cane,\n\n00:05:47.796 --> 00:05:51.710\nyou can feel contrasting textures in the floor below,\n\n00:05:51.710 --> 00:05:54.144\nand over time you build a pattern of where you are\n\n00:05:54.144 --> 00:05:55.686\nand where you're headed.\n\n00:05:55.686 --> 00:05:58.578\nSimilarly, just the sun warming one side of your face\n\n00:05:58.578 --> 00:06:01.407\nor the wind at your neck\n\n00:06:01.407 --> 00:06:03.607\ngives you clues about your alignment\n\n00:06:03.607 --> 00:06:05.300\nand your progression through a block\n\n00:06:05.300 --> 00:06:08.805\nand your movement through time and space.\n\n00:06:08.805 --> 00:06:11.238\nBut also, the sense of smell.\n\n00:06:11.238 --> 00:06:13.939\nSome districts and cities have their own smell,\n\n00:06:13.939 --> 00:06:16.980\nas do places and things around you,\n\n00:06:16.980 --> 00:06:18.772\nand if you're lucky, you can even follow your nose\n\n00:06:18.772 --> 00:06:22.201\nto that new bakery that you've been looking for.\n\n00:06:22.201 --> 00:06:23.910\nAll this really surprised me,\n\n00:06:23.910 --> 00:06:26.915\nbecause I started to realize that\n\n00:06:26.915 --> 00:06:29.468\nmy unsighted experienced\n\n00:06:29.468 --> 00:06:31.903\nwas so far more multi-sensory\n\n00:06:31.903 --> 00:06:34.928\nthan my sighted experience ever was.\n\n00:06:34.928 --> 00:06:37.668\nWhat struck me also was how much the city\n\n00:06:37.668 --> 00:06:39.300\nwas changing around me.\n\n00:06:39.300 --> 00:06:41.037\nWhen you're sighted,\n\n00:06:41.037 --> 00:06:43.226\neverybody kind of sticks to themselves,\n\n00:06:43.226 --> 00:06:45.039\nyou mind your own business.\n\n00:06:45.039 --> 00:06:46.306\nLose your sight, though,\n\n00:06:46.306 --> 00:06:49.105\nand it's a whole other story.\n\n00:06:49.105 --> 00:06:50.584\nAnd I don't know who's watching who,\n\n00:06:50.584 --> 00:06:54.133\nbut I have a suspicion that\na lot of people are watching me.\n\n00:06:54.133 --> 00:06:56.281\nAnd I'm not paranoid, but everywhere I go,\n\n00:06:56.281 --> 00:06:59.310\nI'm getting all sorts of advice:\n\n00:06:59.310 --> 00:07:01.630\nGo here, move there, watch out for this.\n\n00:07:01.630 --> 00:07:03.707\nA lot of the information is good.\n\n00:07:03.707 --> 00:07:06.193\nSome of it's helpful. A lot of it's kind of reversed.\n\n00:07:06.193 --> 00:07:09.762\nYou've got to figure out what they actually meant.\n\n00:07:09.762 --> 00:07:13.315\nSome of it's kind of wrong and not helpful.\n\n00:07:13.315 --> 00:07:16.326\nBut it's all good in the grand scheme of things.\n\n00:07:16.326 --> 00:07:17.862\nBut one time I was in Oakland\n\n00:07:17.862 --> 00:07:20.749\nwalking along Broadway, and came to a corner.\n\n00:07:20.749 --> 00:07:23.556\nI was waiting for an audible pedestrian signal,\n\n00:07:23.556 --> 00:07:26.042\nand as it went off, I was just about\nto step out into the street,\n\n00:07:26.042 --> 00:07:28.074\nwhen all of a sudden, my right hand\n\n00:07:28.074 --> 00:07:29.754\nwas just gripped by this guy,\n\n00:07:29.754 --> 00:07:32.166\nand he yanked my arm\nand pulled me out into the crosswalk\n\n00:07:32.166 --> 00:07:33.840\nand was dragging me out across the street,\n\n00:07:33.840 --> 00:07:36.092\nspeaking to me in Mandarin.\n\n00:07:36.092 --> 00:07:37.500\n(Laughter)\n\n00:07:37.500 --> 00:07:41.639\nIt's like, there was no escape\nfrom this man's death grip,\n\n00:07:41.639 --> 00:07:43.362\nbut he got me safely there.\n\n00:07:43.362 --> 00:07:45.712\nWhat could I do?\n\n00:07:45.712 --> 00:07:47.508\nBut believe me, there are more polite ways\n\n00:07:47.508 --> 00:07:49.681\nto offer assistance.\n\n00:07:49.681 --> 00:07:51.203\nWe don't know you're there,\n\n00:07:51.203 --> 00:07:53.183\nso it's kind of nice to say \"Hello\" first.\n\n00:07:53.183 --> 00:07:55.319\n\"Would you like some help?\"\n\n00:07:55.319 --> 00:07:58.370\nBut while in Oakland, I've really been struck by\n\n00:07:58.370 --> 00:08:00.988\nhow much the city of Oakland changed\n\n00:08:00.988 --> 00:08:03.490\nas I lost my sight.\n\n00:08:03.490 --> 00:08:05.657\nI liked it sighted. It was fine.\n\n00:08:05.657 --> 00:08:08.233\nIt's a perfectly great city.\n\n00:08:08.233 --> 00:08:09.502\nBut once I lost my sight\n\n00:08:09.502 --> 00:08:11.817\nand was walking along Broadway,\n\n00:08:11.817 --> 00:08:15.028\nI was blessed every block of the way.\n\n00:08:15.028 --> 00:08:16.582\n\"Bless you, man.\"\n\n00:08:16.582 --> 00:08:18.845\n\"Go for it, brother.\"\n\n00:08:18.845 --> 00:08:20.595\n\"God bless you.\"\n\n00:08:20.595 --> 00:08:22.455\nI didn't get that sighted.\n\n00:08:22.455 --> 00:08:23.791\n(Laughter)\n\n00:08:23.791 --> 00:08:30.116\nAnd even without sight,\nI don't get that in San Francisco.\n\n00:08:30.116 --> 00:08:33.108\nAnd I know it bothers some of my blind friends,\n\n00:08:33.108 --> 00:08:34.701\nit's not just me.\n\n00:08:34.701 --> 00:08:36.750\nOften it's thought that\n\n00:08:36.750 --> 00:08:39.894\nthat's an emotion that comes up out of pity.\n\n00:08:39.894 --> 00:08:43.007\nI tend to think that it comes\nout of our shared humanity,\n\n00:08:43.007 --> 00:08:46.117\nout of our togetherness, and I think it's pretty cool.\n\n00:08:46.117 --> 00:08:47.977\nIn fact, if I'm feeling down,\n\n00:08:47.977 --> 00:08:49.885\nI just go to Broadway in downtown Oakland,\n\n00:08:49.885 --> 00:08:52.544\nI go for a walk, and I feel better like that,\n\n00:08:52.544 --> 00:08:55.815\nin no time at all.\n\n00:08:55.815 --> 00:08:57.850\nBut also that it illustrates how\n\n00:08:57.850 --> 00:08:59.632\ndisability and blindness\n\n00:08:59.632 --> 00:09:02.352\nsort of cuts across ethnic, social,\n\n00:09:02.352 --> 00:09:05.078\nracial, economic lines.\n\n00:09:05.078 --> 00:09:08.913\nDisability is an equal-opportunity provider.\n\n00:09:08.913 --> 00:09:11.356\nEverybody's welcome.\n\n00:09:11.356 --> 00:09:13.917\nIn fact, I've heard it said in the disability community\n\n00:09:13.917 --> 00:09:16.419\nthat there are really only two types of people:\n\n00:09:16.419 --> 00:09:18.178\nThere are those with disabilities,\n\n00:09:18.178 --> 00:09:22.840\nand there are those that haven't\nquite found theirs yet.\n\n00:09:22.840 --> 00:09:24.961\nIt's a different way of thinking about it,\n\n00:09:24.961 --> 00:09:27.210\nbut I think it's kind of beautiful,\n\n00:09:27.210 --> 00:09:29.386\nbecause it is certainly far more inclusive\n\n00:09:29.386 --> 00:09:31.491\nthan the us-versus-them\n\n00:09:31.491 --> 00:09:34.059\nor the abled-versus-the-disabled,\n\n00:09:34.059 --> 00:09:36.837\nand it's a lot more honest and respectful\n\n00:09:36.837 --> 00:09:40.141\nof the fragility of life.\n\n00:09:40.141 --> 00:09:42.066\nSo my final takeaway for you is\n\n00:09:42.066 --> 00:09:46.134\nthat not only is the city good for the blind,\n\n00:09:46.134 --> 00:09:49.313\nbut the city needs us.\n\n00:09:49.313 --> 00:09:51.351\nAnd I'm so sure of that that\n\n00:09:51.351 --> 00:09:52.947\nI want to propose to you today\n\n00:09:52.947 --> 00:09:56.387\nthat the blind be taken as\nthe prototypical city dwellers\n\n00:09:56.387 --> 00:09:59.672\nwhen imagining new and wonderful cities,\n\n00:09:59.672 --> 00:10:01.533\nand not the people that are thought about\n\n00:10:01.533 --> 00:10:03.766\nafter the mold has already been cast.\n\n00:10:03.766 --> 00:10:06.819\nIt's too late then.\n\n00:10:06.819 --> 00:10:10.003\nSo if you design a city with the blind in mind,\n\n00:10:10.003 --> 00:10:14.588\nyou'll have a rich, walkable network of sidewalks\n\n00:10:14.588 --> 00:10:16.702\nwith a dense array of options and choices\n\n00:10:16.702 --> 00:10:20.134\nall available at the street level.\n\n00:10:20.134 --> 00:10:22.456\nIf you design a city with the blind in mind,\n\n00:10:22.456 --> 00:10:25.576\nsidewalks will be predictable and will be generous.\n\n00:10:25.576 --> 00:10:27.929\nThe space between buildings will be well-balanced\n\n00:10:27.929 --> 00:10:31.368\nbetween people and cars.\n\n00:10:31.368 --> 00:10:35.425\nIn fact, cars, who needs them?\n\n00:10:35.425 --> 00:10:38.510\nIf you're blind, you don't drive. (Laughter)\n\n00:10:38.510 --> 00:10:41.873\nThey don't like it when you drive. (Laughter)\n\n00:10:41.873 --> 00:10:44.583\nIf you design a city with the blind in mind,\n\n00:10:44.583 --> 00:10:47.226\nyou design a city with a robust,\n\n00:10:47.226 --> 00:10:50.918\naccessible, well-connected mass transit system\n\n00:10:50.918 --> 00:10:52.520\nthat connects all parts of the city\n\n00:10:52.520 --> 00:10:55.539\nand the region all around.\n\n00:10:55.539 --> 00:10:57.605\nIf you design a city with the blind in mind,\n\n00:10:57.605 --> 00:11:00.424\nthere'll be jobs, lots of jobs.\n\n00:11:00.424 --> 00:11:01.754\nBlind people want to work too.\n\n00:11:01.754 --> 00:11:04.193\nThey want to earn a living.\n\n00:11:04.193 --> 00:11:06.949\nSo, in designing a city for the blind,\n\n00:11:06.949 --> 00:11:09.018\nI hope you start to realize\n\n00:11:09.018 --> 00:11:11.896\nthat it actually would be a more inclusive,\n\n00:11:11.896 --> 00:11:15.502\na more equitable, a more just city for all.\n\n00:11:15.502 --> 00:11:17.722\nAnd based on my prior sighted experience,\n\n00:11:17.722 --> 00:11:19.700\nit sounds like a pretty cool city,\n\n00:11:19.700 --> 00:11:23.047\nwhether you're blind, whether you have a disability,\n\n00:11:23.047 --> 00:11:25.531\nor you haven't quite found yours yet.\n\n00:11:25.531 --> 00:11:28.143\nSo thank you.\n\n00:11:28.143 --> 00:11:32.143\n(Applause)"}, {"title": "The link between unemployment and terrorism", "duration": "541", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/mohamed_ali_the_link_between_unemployment_and_terrorism", "transcript": "I would like to talk to you about a story about a small town kid. I don't know his name, but I do know his story. He lives in a small village in southern Somalia. His village is near Mogadishu. Drought drives the small village into poverty and to the brink of starvation. With nothing left for him there, he leaves for the big city, in this case, Mogadishu, the capital of Somalia. When he arrives, there are no opportunities, no jobs, no way forward. He ends up living in a tent city on the outskirts of Mogadishu. Maybe a year passes, nothing. One day, he's approached by a gentleman who offers to take him to lunch, then to dinner, to breakfast. He meets this dynamic group of people, and they give him a break. He's given a bit of money to buy himself some new clothes, money to send back home to his family. He is introduced to this young woman. He eventually gets married. He starts this new life. He has a purpose in life.One beautiful day in Mogadishu, under an azure blue sky, a car bomb goes off. That small town kid with the big city dreams was the suicide bomber, and that dynamic group of people were al Shabaab, a terrorist organization linked to al Qaeda.So how does the story of a small town kid just trying to make it big in the city end up with him blowing himself up? He was waiting. He was waiting for an opportunity, waiting to begin his future, waiting for a way forward, and this was the first thing that came along. This was the first thing that pulled him out of what we call waithood.And his story repeats itself in urban centers around the world. It is the story of the disenfranchised, unemployed urban youth who sparks riots in Johannesburg, sparks riots in London, who reaches out for something other than waithood. For young people, the promise of the city, the big city dream is that of opportunity, of jobs, of wealth, but young people are not sharing in the prosperity of their cities. Often it's youth who suffer from the highest unemployment rates. By 2030, three out of five people living in cities will be under the age of 18. If we do not include young people in the growth of our cities, if we do not provide them opportunities, the story of waithood, the gateway to terrorism, to violence, to gangs, will be the story of cities 2.0. And in my city of birth, Mogadishu, 70 percent of young people suffer from unemployment. 70 percent don't work, don't go to school. They pretty much do nothing.I went back to Mogadishu last month, and I went to visit Madina Hospital, the hospital I was born in. I remember standing in front of that bullet-ridden hospital thinking, what if I had never left? What if I had been forced into that same state of waithood? Would I have become a terrorist? I'm not really sure about the answer.My reason for being in Mogadishu that month was actually to host a youth leadership and entrepreneurship summit. I brought together about 90 young Somali leaders. We sat down and brainstormed on solutions to the biggest challenges facing their city.One of the young men in the room was Aden. He went to university in Mogadishu, graduated. There were no jobs, no opportunities. I remember him telling me, because he was a college graduate, unemployed, frustrated, that he was the perfect target for al Shabaab and other terrorist organizations, to be recruited. They sought people like him out.But his story takes a different route. In Mogadishu, the biggest barrier to getting from point A to point B are the roads. Twenty-three years of civil war have completely destroyed the road system, and a motorbike can be the easiest way to get around. Aden saw an opportunity and seized it. He started a motorbike company. He began renting out motorbikes to local residents who couldn't normally afford them. He bought 10 bikes, with the help of family and friends, and his dream is to eventually expand to several hundred within the next three years.How is this story different? What makes his story different? I believe it is his ability to identify and seize a new opportunity. It's entrepreneurship, and I believe entrepreneurship can be the most powerful tool against waithood. It empowers young people to be the creators of the very economic opportunities they are so desperately seeking.And you can train young people to be entrepreneurs. I want to talk to you about a young man who attended one of my meetings, Mohamed Mohamoud, a florist. He was helping me train some of the young people at the summit in entrepreneurship and how to be innovative and how to create a culture of entrepreneurship. He's actually the first florist Mogadishu has seen in over 22 years, and until recently, until Mohamed came along, if you wanted flowers at your wedding, you used plastic bouquets shipped from abroad. If you asked someone, \"When was the last time you saw fresh flowers?\" for many who grew up under civil war, the answer would be, \"Never.\"So Mohamed saw an opportunity. He started a landscaping and design floral company. He created a farm right outside of Mogadishu, and started growing tulips and lilies, which he said could survive the harsh Mogadishu climate. And he began delivering flowers to weddings, creating gardens at homes and businesses around the city, and he's now working on creating Mogadishu's first public park in 22 years. There's no public park in Mogadishu. He wants to create a space where families, young people, can come together, and, as he says, smell the proverbial roses. And he doesn't grow roses because they use too much water, by the way.So the first step is to inspire young people, and in that room, Mohamed's presence had a really profound impact on the youth in that room. They had never really thought about starting up a business. They've thought about working for an NGO, working for the government, but his story, his innovation, really had a strong impact on them. He forced them to look at their city as a place of opportunity. He empowered them to believe that they could be entrepreneurs, that they could be change makers. By the end of the day, they were coming up with innovative solutions to some of the biggest challenges facing their city. They came up with entrepreneurial solutions to local problems.So inspiring young people and creating a culture of entrepreneurship is a really great step, but young people need capital to make their ideas a reality. They need expertise and mentorship to guide them in developing and launching their businesses. Connect young people with the resources they need, provide them the support they need to go from ideation to creation, and you will create catalysts for urban growth.For me, entrepreneurship is more than just starting up a business. It's about creating a social impact. Mohamed is not simply selling flowers. I believe he is selling hope. His Peace Park, and that's what he calls it, when it's created, will actually transform the way people see their city. Aden hired street kids to help rent out and maintain those bikes for him. He gave them the opportunity to escape the paralysis of waithood. These young entrepreneurs are having a tremendous impact in their cities.So my suggestion is, turn youth into entrepreneurs, incubate and nurture their inherent innovation, and you will have more stories of flowers and Peace Parks than of car bombs and waithood.Thank you.(Applause)", "id": 1864, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:12.155 -->

story.\n\n00:00:20.196 --> 00:00:23.272\nHe lives in a small village in southern Somalia.\n\n00:00:23.272 --> 00:00:27.302\nHis village is near Mogadishu.\n\n00:00:27.302 --> 00:00:29.476\nDrought drives the small village into poverty\n\n00:00:29.476 --> 00:00:31.344\nand to the brink of starvation.\n\n00:00:31.344 --> 00:00:33.180\nWith nothing left for him there,\n\n00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:35.007\nhe leaves for the big city,\n\n00:00:35.007 --> 00:00:38.412\nin this case, Mogadishu, the capital of Somalia.\n\n00:00:38.412 --> 00:00:41.242\nWhen he arrives, there are no opportunities,\n\n00:00:41.242 --> 00:00:44.230\nno jobs, no way forward.\n\n00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:46.254\nHe ends up living in a tent city\n\n00:00:46.254 --> 00:00:48.958\non the outskirts of Mogadishu.\n\n00:00:48.958 --> 00:00:52.967\nMaybe a year passes, nothing.\n\n00:00:52.967 --> 00:00:55.267\nOne day, he's approached by a gentleman\n\n00:00:55.267 --> 00:00:57.465\nwho offers to take him to lunch,\n\n00:00:57.465 --> 00:01:00.541\nthen to dinner, to breakfast.\n\n00:01:00.541 --> 00:01:03.560\nHe meets this dynamic group of people,\n\n00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:05.065\nand they give him a break.\n\n00:01:05.065 --> 00:01:06.384\nHe's given a bit of money\n\n00:01:06.384 --> 00:01:08.486\nto buy himself some new clothes,\n\n00:01:08.486 --> 00:01:11.022\nmoney to send back home to his family.\n\n00:01:11.022 --> 00:01:12.995\nHe is introduced to this young woman.\n\n00:01:12.995 --> 00:01:14.710\nHe eventually gets married.\n\n00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:17.515\nHe starts this new life.\n\n00:01:17.515 --> 00:01:20.441\nHe has a purpose in life.\n\n00:01:20.441 --> 00:01:23.215\nOne beautiful day in Mogadishu,\n\n00:01:23.215 --> 00:01:26.103\nunder an azure blue sky,\n\n00:01:26.103 --> 00:01:28.624\na car bomb goes off.\n\n00:01:28.624 --> 00:01:31.819\nThat small town kid with the big city dreams\n\n00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:34.067\nwas the suicide bomber,\n\n00:01:34.067 --> 00:01:36.425\nand that dynamic group of people\n\n00:01:36.425 --> 00:01:38.794\nwere al Shabaab, a terrorist organization\n\n00:01:38.794 --> 00:01:42.475\nlinked to al Qaeda.\n\n00:01:42.475 --> 00:01:45.347\nSo how does the story of a small town kid\n\n00:01:45.347 --> 00:01:47.168\njust trying to make it big in the city\n\n00:01:47.168 --> 00:01:49.998\nend up with him blowing himself up?\n\n00:01:49.998 --> 00:01:51.970\nHe was waiting.\n\n00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:53.868\nHe was waiting for an opportunity,\n\n00:01:53.868 --> 00:01:55.650\nwaiting to begin his future,\n\n00:01:55.650 --> 00:01:57.685\nwaiting for a way forward,\n\n00:01:57.685 --> 00:02:00.064\nand this was the first thing that came along.\n\n00:02:00.064 --> 00:02:02.478\nThis was the first thing that pulled him out\n\n00:02:02.478 --> 00:02:05.418\nof what we call waithood.\n\n00:02:05.418 --> 00:02:07.714\nAnd his story repeats itself\n\n00:02:07.714 --> 00:02:10.130\nin urban centers around the world.\n\n00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:12.884\nIt is the story of the disenfranchised,\n\n00:02:12.884 --> 00:02:14.692\nunemployed urban youth\n\n00:02:14.692 --> 00:02:18.635\nwho sparks riots in Johannesburg,\n\n00:02:18.635 --> 00:02:20.969\nsparks riots in London,\n\n00:02:20.969 --> 00:02:25.623\nwho reaches out for something other than waithood.\n\n00:02:25.623 --> 00:02:28.287\nFor young people, the promise of the city,\n\n00:02:28.287 --> 00:02:30.981\nthe big city dream is that of opportunity,\n\n00:02:30.981 --> 00:02:33.136\nof jobs, of wealth,\n\n00:02:33.136 --> 00:02:36.877\nbut young people are not sharing\nin the prosperity of their cities.\n\n00:02:36.877 --> 00:02:40.975\nOften it's youth who suffer from\nthe highest unemployment rates.\n\n00:02:40.975 --> 00:02:44.168\nBy 2030, three out of five people living in cities\n\n00:02:44.168 --> 00:02:46.728\nwill be under the age of 18.\n\n00:02:46.728 --> 00:02:48.492\nIf we do not include young people\n\n00:02:48.492 --> 00:02:50.311\nin the growth of our cities,\n\n00:02:50.311 --> 00:02:52.790\nif we do not provide them opportunities,\n\n00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:54.812\nthe story of waithood,\n\n00:02:54.812 --> 00:02:57.725\nthe gateway to terrorism, to violence, to gangs,\n\n00:02:57.725 --> 00:03:01.900\nwill be the story of cities 2.0.\n\n00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:05.061\nAnd in my city of birth, Mogadishu,\n\n00:03:05.061 --> 00:03:08.751\n70 percent of young people\nsuffer from unemployment.\n\n00:03:08.751 --> 00:03:11.129\n70 percent don't work,\n\n00:03:11.129 --> 00:03:13.156\ndon't go to school.\n\n00:03:13.156 --> 00:03:15.581\nThey pretty much do nothing.\n\n00:03:15.581 --> 00:03:19.097\nI went back to Mogadishu last month,\n\n00:03:19.097 --> 00:03:21.107\nand I went to visit Madina Hospital,\n\n00:03:21.107 --> 00:03:23.155\nthe hospital I was born in.\n\n00:03:23.155 --> 00:03:25.180\nI remember standing in front of that\n\n00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:28.158\nbullet-ridden hospital thinking,\n\n00:03:28.158 --> 00:03:30.191\nwhat if I had never left?\n\n00:03:30.191 --> 00:03:31.384\nWhat if I had been forced\n\n00:03:31.384 --> 00:03:33.903\ninto that same state of waithood?\n\n00:03:33.903 --> 00:03:37.914\nWould I have become a terrorist?\n\n00:03:37.914 --> 00:03:40.805\nI'm not really sure about the answer.\n\n00:03:40.805 --> 00:03:42.973\nMy reason for being in Mogadishu that month\n\n00:03:42.973 --> 00:03:44.520\nwas actually to host\n\n00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:47.067\na youth leadership and entrepreneurship summit.\n\n00:03:47.067 --> 00:03:50.063\nI brought together about 90 young Somali leaders.\n\n00:03:50.063 --> 00:03:52.309\nWe sat down and brainstormed on solutions\n\n00:03:52.309 --> 00:03:55.185\nto the biggest challenges facing their city.\n\n00:03:55.185 --> 00:03:58.587\nOne of the young men in the room was Aden.\n\n00:03:58.587 --> 00:04:03.042\nHe went to university in Mogadishu, graduated.\n\n00:04:03.042 --> 00:04:05.231\nThere were no jobs, no opportunities.\n\n00:04:05.231 --> 00:04:06.949\nI remember him telling me,\n\n00:04:06.949 --> 00:04:09.757\nbecause he was a college graduate,\n\n00:04:09.757 --> 00:04:12.507\nunemployed, frustrated,\n\n00:04:12.507 --> 00:04:14.904\nthat he was the perfect target for al Shabaab\n\n00:04:14.904 --> 00:04:17.956\nand other terrorist organizations, to be recruited.\n\n00:04:17.956 --> 00:04:21.834\nThey sought people like him out.\n\n00:04:21.834 --> 00:04:24.930\nBut his story takes a different route.\n\n00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:26.867\nIn Mogadishu, the biggest barrier\n\n00:04:26.867 --> 00:04:30.120\nto getting from point A to point B are the roads.\n\n00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:31.903\nTwenty-three years of civil war\n\n00:04:31.903 --> 00:04:34.134\nhave completely destroyed the road system,\n\n00:04:34.134 --> 00:04:36.143\nand a motorbike can be the easiest way\n\n00:04:36.143 --> 00:04:37.773\nto get around.\n\n00:04:37.773 --> 00:04:41.014\nAden saw an opportunity and seized it.\n\n00:04:41.014 --> 00:04:43.139\nHe started a motorbike company.\n\n00:04:43.139 --> 00:04:45.430\nHe began renting out motorbikes\n\n00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:48.730\nto local residents who couldn't normally afford them.\n\n00:04:48.730 --> 00:04:50.751\nHe bought 10 bikes, with the help\n\n00:04:50.751 --> 00:04:52.449\nof family and friends,\n\n00:04:52.449 --> 00:04:54.182\nand his dream is to eventually expand\n\n00:04:54.182 --> 00:04:57.163\nto several hundred within the next three years.\n\n00:04:57.163 --> 00:04:59.731\nHow is this story different?\n\n00:04:59.731 --> 00:05:02.088\nWhat makes his story different?\n\n00:05:02.088 --> 00:05:04.918\nI believe it is his ability to identify\n\n00:05:04.918 --> 00:05:08.256\nand seize a new opportunity.\n\n00:05:08.256 --> 00:05:10.287\nIt's entrepreneurship,\n\n00:05:10.287 --> 00:05:12.046\nand I believe entrepreneurship can be\n\n00:05:12.046 --> 00:05:15.024\nthe most powerful tool against waithood.\n\n00:05:15.024 --> 00:05:16.794\nIt empowers young people\n\n00:05:16.794 --> 00:05:20.174\nto be the creators of the very economic opportunities\n\n00:05:20.174 --> 00:05:22.672\nthey are so desperately seeking.\n\n00:05:22.672 --> 00:05:26.354\nAnd you can train young people to be entrepreneurs.\n\n00:05:26.354 --> 00:05:28.470\nI want to talk to you about a young man\n\n00:05:28.470 --> 00:05:30.759\nwho attended one of my meetings,\n\n00:05:30.759 --> 00:05:33.643\nMohamed Mohamoud, a florist.\n\n00:05:33.643 --> 00:05:35.326\nHe was helping me train some of the young people\n\n00:05:35.326 --> 00:05:36.763\nat the summit in entrepreneurship\n\n00:05:36.763 --> 00:05:38.385\nand how to be innovative\n\n00:05:38.385 --> 00:05:41.152\nand how to create a culture of entrepreneurship.\n\n00:05:41.152 --> 00:05:43.649\nHe's actually the first florist Mogadishu has seen\n\n00:05:43.649 --> 00:05:46.333\nin over 22 years,\n\n00:05:46.333 --> 00:05:49.597\nand until recently, until Mohamed came along,\n\n00:05:49.597 --> 00:05:51.487\nif you wanted flowers at your wedding,\n\n00:05:51.487 --> 00:05:52.880\nyou used plastic bouquets\n\n00:05:52.880 --> 00:05:54.466\nshipped from abroad.\n\n00:05:54.466 --> 00:05:56.272\nIf you asked someone,\n\n00:05:56.272 --> 00:05:58.547\n\"When was the last time you saw fresh flowers?\"\n\n00:05:58.547 --> 00:06:01.133\nfor many who grew up under civil war,\n\n00:06:01.133 --> 00:06:03.916\nthe answer would be, \"Never.\"\n\n00:06:03.916 --> 00:06:05.864\nSo Mohamed saw an opportunity.\n\n00:06:05.864 --> 00:06:10.311\nHe started a landscaping and design floral company.\n\n00:06:10.311 --> 00:06:13.619\nHe created a farm right outside of Mogadishu,\n\n00:06:13.619 --> 00:06:15.675\nand started growing tulips and lilies,\n\n00:06:15.675 --> 00:06:17.381\nwhich he said could survive\n\n00:06:17.381 --> 00:06:20.092\nthe harsh Mogadishu climate.\n\n00:06:20.092 --> 00:06:23.790\nAnd he began delivering flowers to weddings,\n\n00:06:23.790 --> 00:06:25.723\ncreating gardens at homes\n\n00:06:25.723 --> 00:06:28.327\nand businesses around the city,\n\n00:06:28.327 --> 00:06:30.064\nand he's now working on creating\n\n00:06:30.064 --> 00:06:33.689\nMogadishu's first public park in 22 years.\n\n00:06:33.689 --> 00:06:35.788\nThere's no public park in Mogadishu.\n\n00:06:35.788 --> 00:06:38.117\nHe wants to create a space where families,\n\n00:06:38.117 --> 00:06:39.768\nyoung people, can come together,\n\n00:06:39.768 --> 00:06:44.406\nand, as he says, smell the proverbial roses.\n\n00:06:44.406 --> 00:06:46.362\nAnd he doesn't grow roses because\n\n00:06:46.362 --> 00:06:50.486\nthey use too much water, by the way.\n\n00:06:50.486 --> 00:06:54.798\nSo the first step is to inspire young people,\n\n00:06:54.798 --> 00:06:56.990\nand in that room, Mohamed's presence\n\n00:06:56.990 --> 00:07:00.466\nhad a really profound impact\non the youth in that room.\n\n00:07:00.466 --> 00:07:03.053\nThey had never really thought\nabout starting up a business.\n\n00:07:03.053 --> 00:07:04.900\nThey've thought about working for an NGO,\n\n00:07:04.900 --> 00:07:06.587\nworking for the government,\n\n00:07:06.587 --> 00:07:10.894\nbut his story, his innovation,\n\n00:07:10.894 --> 00:07:12.847\nreally had a strong impact on them.\n\n00:07:12.847 --> 00:07:14.966\nHe forced them to look at their city\n\n00:07:14.966 --> 00:07:16.720\nas a place of opportunity.\n\n00:07:16.720 --> 00:07:20.468\nHe empowered them to believe\nthat they could be entrepreneurs,\n\n00:07:20.468 --> 00:07:22.888\nthat they could be change makers.\n\n00:07:22.888 --> 00:07:24.448\nBy the end of the day, they were coming up\n\n00:07:24.448 --> 00:07:25.999\nwith innovative solutions\n\n00:07:25.999 --> 00:07:29.331\nto some of the biggest challenges facing their city.\n\n00:07:29.331 --> 00:07:31.934\nThey came up with entrepreneurial solutions\n\n00:07:31.934 --> 00:07:34.856\nto local problems.\n\n00:07:34.856 --> 00:07:37.087\nSo inspiring young people\n\n00:07:37.087 --> 00:07:39.501\nand creating a culture of entrepreneurship\n\n00:07:39.501 --> 00:07:41.368\nis a really great step,\n\n00:07:41.368 --> 00:07:43.057\nbut young people need capital\n\n00:07:43.057 --> 00:07:44.846\nto make their ideas a reality.\n\n00:07:44.846 --> 00:07:47.170\nThey need expertise and mentorship\n\n00:07:47.170 --> 00:07:50.570\nto guide them in developing\nand launching their businesses.\n\n00:07:50.570 --> 00:07:53.057\nConnect young people with the resources they need,\n\n00:07:53.057 --> 00:07:56.522\nprovide them the support they need\nto go from ideation to creation,\n\n00:07:56.522 --> 00:08:00.622\nand you will create catalysts for urban growth.\n\n00:08:00.622 --> 00:08:03.546\nFor me, entrepreneurship is more than just\n\n00:08:03.546 --> 00:08:05.102\nstarting up a business.\n\n00:08:05.102 --> 00:08:07.483\nIt's about creating a social impact.\n\n00:08:07.483 --> 00:08:09.618\nMohamed is not simply selling flowers.\n\n00:08:09.618 --> 00:08:12.105\nI believe he is selling hope.\n\n00:08:12.105 --> 00:08:14.694\nHis Peace Park, and that's what he calls it,\n\n00:08:14.694 --> 00:08:16.866\nwhen it's created, will actually transform\n\n00:08:16.866 --> 00:08:18.938\nthe way people see their city.\n\n00:08:18.938 --> 00:08:21.091\nAden hired street kids to help rent out\n\n00:08:21.091 --> 00:08:22.953\nand maintain those bikes for him.\n\n00:08:22.953 --> 00:08:25.011\nHe gave them the opportunity to escape\n\n00:08:25.011 --> 00:08:27.947\nthe paralysis of waithood.\n\n00:08:27.947 --> 00:08:29.977\nThese young entrepreneurs are having\n\n00:08:29.977 --> 00:08:33.511\na tremendous impact in their cities.\n\n00:08:33.511 --> 00:08:36.027\nSo my suggestion is,\n\n00:08:36.027 --> 00:08:38.543\nturn youth into

from each other", "duration": "776", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/stefan_larsson_what_doctors_can_learn_from_each_other", "transcript": "Five years ago, I was on a sabbatical, and I returned to the medical university where I studied. I saw real patients and I wore the white coat for the first time in 17 years, in fact since I became a management consultant.There were two things that surprised me during the month I spent. The first one was that the common theme of the discussions we had were hospital budgets and cost-cutting, and the second thing, which really bothered me, actually, was that several of the colleagues I met, former friends from medical school, who I knew to be some of the smartest, most motivated, engaged and passionate people I'd ever met, many of them had turned cynical, disengaged, or had distanced themselves from hospital management. So with this focus on cost-cutting, I asked myself, are we forgetting the patient?Many countries that you represent and where I come from struggle with the cost of healthcare. It's a big part of the national budgets. And many different reforms aim at holding back this growth. In some countries, we have long waiting times for patients for surgery. In other countries, new drugs are not being reimbursed, and therefore don't reach patients. In several countries, doctors and nurses are the targets, to some extent, for the governments. After all, the costly decisions in health care are taken by doctors and nurses. You choose an expensive lab test, you choose to operate on an old and frail patient. So, by limiting the degrees of freedom of physicians, this is a way to hold costs down. And ultimately, some physicians will say today that they don't have the full liberty to make the choices they think are right for their patients. So no wonder that some of my old colleagues are frustrated.At BCG, we looked at this, and we asked ourselves, this can't be the right way of managing healthcare. And so we took a step back and we said, \"What is it that we are trying to achieve?\" Ultimately, in the healthcare system, we're aiming at improving health for the patients, and we need to do so at a limited, or affordable, cost. We call this value-based healthcare. On the screen behind me, you see what we mean by value: outcomes that matter to patients relative to the money we spend. This was described beautifully in a book in 2006 by Michael Porter and Elizabeth Teisberg.On this picture, you have my father-in-law surrounded by his three beautiful daughters. When we started doing our research at BCG, we decided not to look so much at the costs, but to look at the quality instead, and in the research, one of the things that fascinated us was the variation we saw. You compare hospitals in a country, you'll find some that are extremely good, but you'll find a large number that are vastly much worse. The differences were dramatic. Erik, my father-in-law, he suffers from prostate cancer, and he probably needs surgery. Now living in Europe, he can choose to go to Germany that has a well-reputed healthcare system. If he goes there and goes to the average hospital, he will have the risk of becoming incontinent by about 50 percent, so he would have to start wearing diapers again. You flip a coin. Fifty percent risk. That's quite a lot. If he instead would go to Hamburg, and to a clinic called the Martini-Klinik, the risk would be only one in 20. Either you a flip a coin, or you have a one in 20 risk. That's a huge difference, a seven-fold difference. When we look at many hospitals for many different diseases, we see these huge differences.But you and I don't know. We don't have the data. And often, the data actually doesn't exist. Nobody knows. So going the hospital is a lottery.Now, it doesn't have to be that way. There is hope. In the late '70s, there were a group of Swedish orthopedic surgeons who met at their annual meeting, and they were discussing the different procedures they used to operate hip surgery. To the left of this slide, you see a variety of metal pieces, artificial hips that you would use for somebody who needs a new hip. They all realized they had their individual way of operating. They all argued that, \"My technique is the best,\" but none of them actually knew, and they admitted that. So they said, \"We probably need to measure quality so we know and can learn from what's best.\" So they in fact spent two years debating, \"So what is quality in hip surgery?\" \"Oh, we should measure this.\" \"No, we should measure that.\" And they finally agreed. And once they had agreed, they started measuring, and started sharing the data. Very quickly, they found that if you put cement in the bone of the patient before you put the metal shaft in, it actually lasted a lot longer, and most patients would never have to be re-operated on in their lifetime. They published the data, and it actually transformed clinical practice in the country. Everybody saw this makes a lot of sense. Since then, they publish every year. Once a year, they publish the league table: who's best, who's at the bottom? And they visit each other to try to learn, so a continuous cycle of improvement. For many years, Swedish hip surgeons had the best results in the world, at least for those who actually were measuring, and many were not.Now I found this principle really exciting. So the physicians get together, they agree on what quality is, they start measuring, they share the data, they find who's best, and they learn from it. Continuous improvement.Now, that's not the only exciting part. That's exciting in itself. But if you bring back the cost side of the equation, and look at that, it turns out, those who have focused on quality, they actually also have the lowest costs, although that's not been the purpose in the first place. So if you look at the hip surgery story again, there was a study done a couple years ago where they compared the U.S. and Sweden. They looked at how many patients have needed to be re-operated on seven years after the first surgery. In the United States, the number was three times higher than in Sweden. So many unnecessary surgeries, and so much unnecessary suffering for all the patients who were operated on in that seven year period. Now, you can imagine how much savings there would be for society.We did a study where we looked at OECD data. OECD does, every so often, look at quality of care where they can find the data across the member countries. The United States has, for many diseases, actually a quality which is below the average in OECD. Now, if the American healthcare system would focus a lot more on measuring quality, and raise quality just to the level of average OECD, it would save the American people 500 billion U.S. dollars a year. That's 20 percent of the budget, of the healthcare budget of the country.Now you may say that these numbers are fantastic, and it's all logical, but is it possible? This would be a paradigm shift in healthcare, and I would argue that not only can it be done, but it has to be done. The agents of change are the doctors and nurses in the healthcare system.In my practice as a consultant, I meet probably a hundred or more than a hundred doctors and nurses and other hospital or healthcare staff every year. The one thing they have in common is they really care about what they achieve in terms of quality for their patients. Physicians are, like most of you in the audience, very competitive. They were always best in class. We were always best in class. And if somebody can show them that the result they perform for their patients is no better than what others do, they will do whatever it takes to improve. But most of them don't know. But physicians have another characteristic. They actually thrive from peer recognition. If a cardiologist calls another cardiologist in a competing hospital and discusses why that other hospital has so much better results, they will share. They will share the information on how to improve. So it is, by measuring and creating transparency, you get a cycle of continuous improvement, which is what this slide shows.Now, you may say this is a nice idea, but this isn't only an idea. This is happening in reality. We're creating a global community, and a large global community, where we'll be able to measure and compare what we achieve. Together with two academic institutions, Michael Porter at Harvard Business School, and the Karolinska Institute in Sweden, BCG has formed something we call ICHOM. You may think that's a sneeze, but it's not a sneeze, it's an acronym. It stands for the International Consortium for Health Outcome Measurement. We're bringing together leading physicians and patients to discuss, disease by disease, what is really quality, what should we measure, and to make those standards global. They've worked \u2014 four working groups have worked during the past year: cataracts, back pain, coronary artery disease, which is, for instance, heart attack, and prostate cancer. The four groups will publish their data in November of this year. That's the first time we'll be comparing apples to apples, not only within a country, but between countries. Next year, we're planning to do eight diseases, the year after, 16. In three years' time, we plan to have covered 40 percent of the disease burden. Compare apples to apples. Who's better? Why is that?Five months ago, I led a workshop at the largest university hospital in Northern Europe. They have a new CEO, and she has a vision: I want to manage my big institution much more on quality, outcomes that matter to patients. This particular day, we sat in a workshop together with physicians, nurses and other staff, discussing leukemia in children. The group discussed, how do we measure quality today? Can we measure it better than we do? We discussed, how do we treat these kids, what are important improvements? And we discussed what are the costs for these patients, can we do treatment more efficiently? There was an enormous energy in the room. There were so many ideas, so much enthusiasm. At the end of the meeting, the chairman of the department, he stood up. He looked over the group and he said \u2014 first he raised his hand, I forgot that \u2014 he raised his hand, clenched his fist, and then he said to the group, \"Thank you. Thank you. Today, we're finally discussing what this hospital does the right way.\"By measuring value in healthcare, that is not only costs but outcomes that matter to patients, we will make staff in hospitals and elsewhere in the healthcare system not a problem but an important part of the solution. I believe measuring value in healthcare will bring about a revolution, and I'm convinced that the founder of modern medicine, the Greek Hippocrates, who always put the patient at the center, he would smile in his grave.Thank you.(Applause)", "id": 1873, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:12.491 --> 00:00:15.047\nFive years ago, I was on a

00:06:06.993\nand many were not.\n\n00:06:06.993 --> 00:06:09.875\nNow I found this principle really exciting.\n\n00:06:09.875 --> 00:06:11.678\nSo the physicians get together,\n\n00:06:11.678 --> 00:06:13.803\nthey agree on what quality is,\n\n00:06:13.803 --> 00:06:17.517\nthey start measuring, they share the data,\n\n00:06:17.517 --> 00:06:21.033\nthey find who's best, and they learn from it.\n\n00:06:21.033 --> 00:06:23.625\nContinuous improvement.\n\n00:06:23.625 --> 00:06:26.173\nNow, that's not the only exciting part.\n\n00:06:26.173 --> 00:06:28.424\nThat's exciting in itself.\n\n00:06:28.424 --> 00:06:31.375\nBut if you bring back the cost side of the equation,\n\n00:06:31.375 --> 00:06:32.835\nand look at that,\n\n00:06:32.835 --> 00:06:35.840\nit turns out, those who have focused on quality,\n\n00:06:35.840 --> 00:06:37.873\nthey actually also have the lowest costs,\n\n00:06:37.873 --> 00:06:40.542\nalthough that's not been the purpose\nin the first place.\n\n00:06:40.542 --> 00:06:43.572\nSo if you look at the hip surgery story again,\n\n00:06:43.572 --> 00:06:45.943\nthere was a study done a couple years ago\n\n00:06:45.943 --> 00:06:49.941\nwhere they compared the U.S. and Sweden.\n\n00:06:49.941 --> 00:06:51.866\nThey looked at how many patients have needed\n\n00:06:51.866 --> 00:06:55.947\nto be re-operated on seven years after the first surgery.\n\n00:06:55.947 --> 00:06:58.834\nIn the United States, the number was three times\n\n00:06:58.834 --> 00:07:01.022\nhigher than in Sweden.\n\n00:07:01.022 --> 00:07:04.462\nSo many unnecessary surgeries,\n\n00:07:04.462 --> 00:07:07.202\nand so much unnecessary suffering\n\n00:07:07.202 --> 00:07:08.894\nfor all the patients who were operated on\n\n00:07:08.894 --> 00:07:11.361\nin that seven year period.\n\n00:07:11.361 --> 00:07:12.940\nNow, you can imagine how much savings\n\n00:07:12.940 --> 00:07:15.440\nthere would be for society.\n\n00:07:15.440 --> 00:07:18.611\nWe did a study where we looked at OECD data.\n\n00:07:18.611 --> 00:07:21.461\nOECD does, every so often,\n\n00:07:21.461 --> 00:07:23.617\nlook at quality of care\n\n00:07:23.617 --> 00:07:28.142\nwhere they can find the data\nacross the member countries.\n\n00:07:28.142 --> 00:07:30.744\nThe United States has, for many diseases,\n\n00:07:30.744 --> 00:07:32.948\nactually a quality which is below the average\n\n00:07:32.948 --> 00:07:34.366\nin OECD.\n\n00:07:34.366 --> 00:07:36.520\nNow, if the American healthcare system\n\n00:07:36.520 --> 00:07:38.956\nwould focus a lot more on measuring quality,\n\n00:07:38.956 --> 00:07:43.005\nand raise quality just to the level of average OECD,\n\n00:07:43.005 --> 00:07:45.343\nit would save the American people\n\n00:07:45.343 --> 00:07:49.469\n500 billion U.S. dollars a year.\n\n00:07:49.469 --> 00:07:52.696\nThat's 20 percent of the budget,\n\n00:07:52.696 --> 00:07:55.409\nof the healthcare budget of the country.\n\n00:07:55.409 --> 00:07:57.516\nNow you may say that these numbers\n\n00:07:57.516 --> 00:08:00.407\nare fantastic, and it's all logical,\n\n00:08:00.407 --> 00:08:02.417\nbut is it possible?\n\n00:08:02.417 --> 00:08:05.056\nThis would be a paradigm shift in healthcare,\n\n00:08:05.056 --> 00:08:08.636\nand I would argue that not only can it be done,\n\n00:08:08.636 --> 00:08:10.870\nbut it has to be done.\n\n00:08:10.870 --> 00:08:14.261\nThe agents of change are the doctors and nurses\n\n00:08:14.261 --> 00:08:16.953\nin the healthcare system.\n\n00:08:16.953 --> 00:08:19.067\nIn my practice as a consultant,\n\n00:08:19.067 --> 00:08:21.334\nI meet probably a hundred or more than a hundred\n\n00:08:21.334 --> 00:08:24.211\ndoctors and nurses and other hospital\n\n00:08:24.211 --> 00:08:27.168\nor healthcare staff every year.\n\n00:08:27.168 --> 00:08:29.354\nThe one thing they have in common is\n\n00:08:29.354 --> 00:08:31.632\nthey really care about what they achieve\n\n00:08:31.632 --> 00:08:34.866\nin terms of quality for their patients.\n\n00:08:34.866 --> 00:08:36.949\nPhysicians are, like most of you in the audience,\n\n00:08:36.949 --> 00:08:39.485\nvery competitive.\n\n00:08:39.485 --> 00:08:41.235\nThey were always best in class.\n\n00:08:41.235 --> 00:08:44.733\nWe were always best in class.\n\n00:08:44.733 --> 00:08:47.347\nAnd if somebody can show them that the result\n\n00:08:47.347 --> 00:08:48.934\nthey perform for their patients\n\n00:08:48.934 --> 00:08:51.788\nis no better than what others do,\n\n00:08:51.788 --> 00:08:54.495\nthey will do whatever it takes to improve.\n\n00:08:54.495 --> 00:08:56.828\nBut most of them don't know.\n\n00:08:56.828 --> 00:08:59.243\nBut physicians have another characteristic.\n\n00:08:59.243 --> 00:09:03.085\nThey actually thrive from peer recognition.\n\n00:09:03.085 --> 00:09:05.319\nIf a cardiologist calls another cardiologist\n\n00:09:05.319 --> 00:09:07.167\nin a competing hospital\n\n00:09:07.167 --> 00:09:09.196\nand discusses why that other hospital\n\n00:09:09.196 --> 00:09:11.991\nhas so much better results, they will share.\n\n00:09:11.991 --> 00:09:15.708\nThey will share the information on how to improve.\n\n00:09:15.708 --> 00:09:19.828\nSo it is, by measuring and creating transparency,\n\n00:09:19.828 --> 00:09:22.738\nyou get a cycle of continuous improvement,\n\n00:09:22.738 --> 00:09:25.612\nwhich is what this slide shows.\n\n00:09:25.612 --> 00:09:28.553\nNow, you may say this is a nice idea,\n\n00:09:28.553 --> 00:09:30.457\nbut this isn't only an idea.\n\n00:09:30.457 --> 00:09:32.485\nThis is happening in reality.\n\n00:09:32.485 --> 00:09:35.639\nWe're creating a global community,\n\n00:09:35.639 --> 00:09:37.502\nand a large global community,\n\n00:09:37.502 --> 00:09:40.049\nwhere we'll be able to measure and compare\n\n00:09:40.049 --> 00:09:41.763\nwhat we achieve.\n\n00:09:41.763 --> 00:09:44.390\nTogether with two academic institutions,\n\n00:09:44.390 --> 00:09:46.384\nMichael Porter at Harvard Business School,\n\n00:09:46.384 --> 00:09:48.268\nand the Karolinska Institute in Sweden,\n\n00:09:48.268 --> 00:09:52.233\nBCG has formed something we call ICHOM.\n\n00:09:52.233 --> 00:09:54.438\nYou may think that's a sneeze,\n\n00:09:54.438 --> 00:09:57.565\nbut it's not a sneeze, it's an acronym.\n\n00:09:57.565 --> 00:10:00.141\nIt stands for the International Consortium\n\n00:10:00.141 --> 00:10:03.101\nfor Health Outcome Measurement.\n\n00:10:03.101 --> 00:10:05.850\nWe're bringing together leading physicians\n\n00:10:05.850 --> 00:10:09.441\nand patients to discuss, disease by disease,\n\n00:10:09.441 --> 00:10:11.543\nwhat is really quality,\n\n00:10:11.543 --> 00:10:13.530\nwhat should we measure,\n\n00:10:13.530 --> 00:10:16.018\nand to make those standards global.\n\n00:10:16.018 --> 00:10:18.373\nThey've worked -- four working groups have worked\n\n00:10:18.373 --> 00:10:20.341\nduring the past year:\n\n00:10:20.341 --> 00:10:23.185\ncataracts, back pain,\n\n00:10:23.185 --> 00:10:27.411\ncoronary artery disease, which is,\nfor instance, heart attack,\n\n00:10:27.411 --> 00:10:29.592\nand prostate cancer.\n\n00:10:29.592 --> 00:10:31.996\nThe four groups will publish their data\n\n00:10:31.996 --> 00:10:33.838\nin November of this year.\n\n00:10:33.838 --> 00:10:36.296\nThat's the first time we'll be comparing\n\n00:10:36.296 --> 00:10:39.242\napples to apples, not only within a country,\n\n00:10:39.242 --> 00:10:42.423\nbut between countries.\n\n00:10:42.423 --> 00:10:46.401\nNext year, we're planning to do eight diseases,\n\n00:10:46.401 --> 00:10:48.955\nthe year after, 16.\n\n00:10:48.955 --> 00:10:51.411\nIn three years' time, we plan to have covered\n\n00:10:51.411 --> 00:10:54.524\n40 percent of the disease burden.\n\n00:10:54.524 --> 00:10:57.174\nCompare apples to apples. Who's better?\n\n00:10:57.174 --> 00:11:00.225\nWhy is that?\n\n00:11:00.225 --> 00:11:03.090\nFive months ago,\n\n00:11:03.090 --> 00:11:06.124\nI led a workshop at the largest university hospital\n\n00:11:06.124 --> 00:11:07.834\nin Northern Europe.\n\n00:11:07.834 --> 00:11:11.321\nThey have a new CEO, and she has a vision:\n\n00:11:11.321 --> 00:11:14.927\nI want to manage my big institution much more\n\n00:11:14.927 --> 00:11:19.032\non quality, outcomes that matter to patients.\n\n00:11:19.032 --> 00:11:22.530\nThis particular day, we sat in a workshop\n\n00:11:22.530 --> 00:11:25.340\ntogether with physicians, nurses and other staff,\n\n00:11:25.340 --> 00:11:29.838\ndiscussing leukemia in children.\n\n00:11:29.838 --> 00:11:31.615\nThe group discussed,\n\n00:11:31.615 --> 00:11:33.655\nhow do we measure quality today?\n\n00:11:33.655 --> 00:11:36.220\nCan we measure it better than we do?\n\n00:11:36.220 --> 00:11:38.442\nWe discussed, how do we treat these kids,\n\n00:11:38.442 --> 00:11:40.493\nwhat are important improvements?\n\n00:11:40.493 --> 00:11:43.274\nAnd we discussed what are\nthe costs for these patients,\n\n00:11:43.274 --> 00:11:45.622\ncan we do treatment more efficiently?\n\n00:11:45.622 --> 00:11:47.566\nThere was an enormous energy in the room.\n\n00:11:47.566 --> 00:11:51.055\nThere were so many ideas, so much enthusiasm.\n\n00:11:51.055 --> 00:11:53.349\nAt the end of the meeting,\n\n00:11:53.349 --> 00:11:56.658\nthe chairman of the department, he stood up.\n\n00:11:56.658 --> 00:12:01.235\nHe looked over the group and he said --\n\n00:12:01.235 --> 00:12:03.020\nfirst he raised his hand, I forgot that --\n\n00:12:03.020 --> 00:12:05.489\nhe raised his hand, clenched his fist,\n\n00:12:05.489 --> 00:12:08.386\nand then he said to the group, \"Thank you.\n\n00:12:08.386 --> 00:12:11.309\nThank you. Today, we're finally discussing\n\n00:12:11.309 --> 00:12:14.883\nwhat this hospital does the right way.\"\n\n00:12:14.883 --> 00:12:16.970\nBy measuring value in healthcare,\n\n00:12:16.970 --> 00:12:18.995\nthat is not only costs\n\n00:12:18.995 --> 00:12:21.468\nbut outcomes that matter to patients,\n\n00:12:21.468 --> 00:12:23.266\nwe will make staff in hospitals\n\n00:12:23.266 --> 00:12:25.125\nand elsewhere in the healthcare system\n\n00:12:25.125 --> 00:12:29.219\nnot a problem but an important part of the solution.\n\n00:12:29.219 --> 00:12:31.155\nI believe measuring value in healthcare\n\n00:12:31.155 --> 00:12:33.926\nwill bring about a revolution,\n\n00:12:33.926 --> 00:12:36.035\nand I'm convinced that the founder\n\n00:12:36.035 --> 00:12:39.498\nof modern medicine, the Greek Hippocrates,\n\n00:12:39.498 --> 00:12:42.448\nwho always put the patient at the center,\n\n00:12:42.448 --> 00:12:44.610\nhe would smile in his grave.\n\n00:12:44.610 --> 00:12:47.411\nThank you.\n\n00:12:47.411 --> 00:12:51.320\n(Applause)"}, {"title": "Massively multi-player\u2026 thumb-wrestling?", "duration": "438", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/jane_mcgonigal_massively_multi_player_thumb_wrestling", "transcript": "Today I am going to teach you how to play my favorite game: massively multiplayer thumb-wrestling. It's the only game in the world that I know of that allows you, the player, the opportunity to experience 10 positive emotions in 60 seconds or less. This is true, so if you play this game with me today for just one single minute, you will get to feel joy, relief, love, surprise, pride, curiosity, excitement, awe and wonder, contentment, and creativity, all in the span of one minute.So this sounds pretty good, right? Now you're willing to play. In order to teach you this game, I'm going to need some volunteers to come up onstage really quickly, and we're going to do a little hands-on demo. While they're coming up, I should let you know, this game was invented 10 years ago by an artists' collective in Austria named Monochrom. So thank you, Monochrom. Okay, so most people are familiar with traditional, two-person thumb-wrestling. Sunni, let's just remind them. One, two, three, four,  I declare a thumb war, and we wrestle, and of course Sunni beats me because she's the best.Now the first thing about massively multiplayer thumb-wrestling, we're the gamer generation. There are a billion gamers on the planet now, so we need more of a challenge. So the first thing we need is more thumbs. So Eric, come on over. So we could get three thumbs together, and Peter could join us. We could even have four thumbs together, and the way you win is you're the first person to pin someone else's thumb. This is really important. You can't, like, wait while they fight it out and then swoop in at the last minute. That is not how you win. Ah, who did that? Eric you did that. So Eric would have won. He was the first person to pin my thumb. Okay, so that's the first rule, and we can see that three or four is kind of the typical number of thumbs in a node, but if you feel ambitious, you don't have to hold back. We can really go for it. So you can see up here. Now the only other rule you need to remember is, gamer generation, we like a challenge. I happen to notice you all have some thumbs you're not using. So I think we should kind of get some more involved. And if we had just four people, we would do it just like this, and we would try and wrestle both thumbs at the same time. Perfect.Now, if we had more people in the room, instead of just wrestling in a closed node, we might reach out and try and grab some other people. And in fact, that's what we're going to do right now. We're going to try and get all, something like, I don't know, 1,500 thumbs in this room connected in a single node. And we have to connect both levels, so if you're up there, you're going to be reaching down and reaching up.Now \u2014 (Laughter) \u2014 before we get started \u2014 This is great. You're excited to play. \u2014 before we get started, can I have the slides back up here really quick, because if you get good at this game, I want you to know there are some advanced levels. So this is the kind of simple level, right? But there are advanced configurations. This is called the Death Star Configuration. Any Star Wars fans? And this one's called the M\u00f6bius Strip. Any science geeks, you get that one. This is the hardest level. This is the extreme.So we'll stick with the normal one for now, and I'm going to give you 30 seconds, every thumb into the node, connect the upper and the lower levels, you guys go on down there. Thirty seconds. Into the network. Make the node.Stand up! It's easier if you stand up. Everybody, up up up up up! Stand up, my friends. All right. Don't start wrestling yet. If you have a free thumb, wave it around, make sure it gets connected. Okay. We need to do a last-minute thumb check. If you have a free thumb, wave it around to make sure. Grab that thumb! Reach behind you. There you go. Any other thumbs? Okay, on the count of three, you're going to go. Try to keep track. Grab, grab, grab it. Okay? One, two, three, go!(Laughter)Did you win? You got it? You got it? Excellent! (Applause) Well done. Thank you. Thank you very much.All right. While you are basking in the glow of having won your first massively multiplayer thumb-wrestling game, let's do a quick recap on the positive emotions. So curiosity. I said \"massively multiplayer thumb-wrestling.\" You were like, \"What the hell is she talking about?\" So I provoked a little curiosity. Creativity: it took creativity to solve the problem of getting all the thumbs into the node. I'm reaching around and I'm reaching up. So you used creativity. That was great. How about surprise? The actual feeling of trying to wrestle two thumbs at once is pretty surprising. You heard that sound go up in the room. We had excitement. As you started to wrestle, maybe you're starting to win or this person's, like, really into it, so you kind of get the excitement going. We have relief. You got to stand up. You've been sitting for awhile, so the physical relief, getting to shake it out. We had joy. You were laughing, smiling. Look at your faces. This room is full of joy. We had some contentment. I didn't see anybody sending text messages or checking their email while we were playing, so you were totally content to be playing. The most important three emotions, awe and wonder, we had everybody connected physically for a minute. When was the last time you were at TED and you got to connect physically with every single person in the room? And it's truly awesome and wondrous. And speaking of physical connection, you guys know I love the hormone oxytocin, you release oxytocin, you feel bonded to everyone in the room. You guys know that the best way to release oxytocin quickly is to hold someone else's hand for at least six seconds. You guys were all holding hands for way more than six seconds, so we are all now biochemically primed to love each other. That is great.And the last emotion of pride. How many people are like me. Just admit it. You lost both your thumbs. It just didn't work out for you. That's okay, because you learned a new skill today. You learned, from scratch, a game you never knew before. Now you know how to play it. You can teach other people. So congratulations. How many of you won just won thumb? All right. I have very good news for you. According to the official rules of massively multiplayer thumb-wrestling, this makes you a grandmaster of the game. Because there aren't that many people who know how to play, we have to kind of accelerate the program more than a game like chess. So congratulations, grandmasters. Win one thumb once, you will become a grandmaster. Did anybody win both their thumbs? Yes. Awesome. Okay. Get ready to update your Twitter or Facebook status. You guys, according to the rules, are legendary grandmasters, so congratulations. I will just leave you with this tip, if you want to play again. The best way to become a legendary grandmaster, you've got your two nodes going on. Pick off the one that looks easiest. They're not paying attention. They look kind of weak.

You can't, like,\n\n00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:47.866\nwait while they fight it out and\nthen swoop in at the last minute.\n\n00:01:47.866 --> 00:01:49.361\nThat is not how you win.\n\n00:01:49.361 --> 00:01:50.696\nAh, who did that? Eric you did that.\n\n00:01:50.696 --> 00:01:53.498\nSo Eric would have won. He was\nthe first person to pin my thumb.\n\n00:01:53.498 --> 00:01:54.908\nOkay, so that's the first rule,\n\n00:01:54.908 --> 00:01:56.767\nand we can see that three or four\n\n00:01:56.767 --> 00:01:59.946\nis kind of the typical number of thumbs in a node,\n\n00:01:59.946 --> 00:02:02.588\nbut if you feel ambitious,\nyou don't have to hold back.\n\n00:02:02.588 --> 00:02:03.953\nWe can really go for it.\n\n00:02:03.953 --> 00:02:06.119\nSo you can see up here.\n\n00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:09.091\nNow the only other rule you need to remember is,\n\n00:02:09.091 --> 00:02:11.358\ngamer generation, we like a challenge.\n\n00:02:11.358 --> 00:02:13.005\nI happen to notice you all have\n\n00:02:13.005 --> 00:02:14.841\nsome thumbs you're not using.\n\n00:02:14.841 --> 00:02:17.848\nSo I think we should kind of get some more involved.\n\n00:02:17.848 --> 00:02:19.618\nAnd if we had just four people,\n\n00:02:19.618 --> 00:02:21.456\nwe would do it just like this,\n\n00:02:21.456 --> 00:02:23.142\nand we would try and wrestle\n\n00:02:23.142 --> 00:02:24.923\nboth thumbs at the same time.\n\n00:02:24.923 --> 00:02:26.230\nPerfect.\n\n00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:28.344\nNow, if we had more people in the room,\n\n00:02:28.344 --> 00:02:30.223\ninstead of just wrestling in a closed node,\n\n00:02:30.223 --> 00:02:33.006\nwe might reach out and try\nand grab some other people.\n\n00:02:33.006 --> 00:02:34.727\nAnd in fact, that's what we're going to do right now.\n\n00:02:34.727 --> 00:02:37.279\nWe're going to try and get all, something like,\n\n00:02:37.279 --> 00:02:40.255\nI don't know, 1,500 thumbs in this room\n\n00:02:40.255 --> 00:02:41.568\nconnected in a single node.\n\n00:02:41.568 --> 00:02:44.608\nAnd we have to connect both levels,\n\n00:02:44.608 --> 00:02:47.054\nso if you're up there, you're going to be\n\n00:02:47.054 --> 00:02:49.267\nreaching down and reaching up.\n\n00:02:49.267 --> 00:02:50.941\nNow \u2014 (Laughter) \u2014\n\n00:02:50.941 --> 00:02:52.833\nbefore we get started --\n\n00:02:52.833 --> 00:02:55.866\nThis is great. You're excited to play. \u2014\n\n00:02:55.866 --> 00:02:58.946\nbefore we get started, can I have\nthe slides back up here really quick,\n\n00:02:58.946 --> 00:03:00.903\nbecause if you get good at this game,\n\n00:03:00.903 --> 00:03:03.539\nI want you to know there are some advanced levels.\n\n00:03:03.539 --> 00:03:06.451\nSo this is the kind of simple level, right?\n\n00:03:06.451 --> 00:03:08.363\nBut there are advanced configurations.\n\n00:03:08.363 --> 00:03:10.373\nThis is called the Death Star Configuration.\n\n00:03:10.373 --> 00:03:12.080\nAny Star Wars fans?\n\n00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:14.428\nAnd this one's called the M\u00f6bius Strip.\n\n00:03:14.428 --> 00:03:16.248\nAny science geeks, you get that one.\n\n00:03:16.248 --> 00:03:19.152\nThis is the hardest level.

What some of us may not realize is that in the Himalayan foothills, where the climate is much warmer and the landscape much greener, there lives a great diversity of wildlife, including the one-horned rhinoceros, the Asian elephant and the Bengal tiger. But unfortunately, these animals are under constant threat from poachers who hunt and kill them for their body parts. To stop the killing of these animals, battalions of soldiers and rangers are sent to protect Nepal's national parks, but that is not an easy task, because these soldiers have to patrol thousands of hectares of forests on foot or elephant backs. It is also risky for these soldiers when they get into gunfights with poachers, and therefore Nepal is always looking for new ways to help with protecting the forests and wildlife.Well recently, Nepal acquired a new tool in the fight against wildlife crime, and these are drones, or more specifically, conservation drones. For about a year now, my colleagues and I have been building drones for Nepal and training the park protection personnel on the use of these drones. Not only does a drone give you a bird's-eye view of the landscape, but it also allows you to capture detailed, high-resolution images of objects on the ground. This, for example, is a pair of rhinoceros taking a cooling bath on a hot summer day in the lowlands of Nepal. Now we believe that drones have tremendous potential, not only for combating wildlife crime, but also for monitoring the health of these wildlife populations.So what is a drone? Well, the kind of drone I'm talking about is simply a model aircraft fitted with an autopilot system, and this autopilot unit contains a tiny computer, a GPS, a compass, a barometric altimeter and a few other sensors. Now a drone like this is meant to carry a useful payload, such as a video camera or a photographic camera. It also requires a software that allows the user to program a mission, to tell the drone where to go.Now people I talk to are often surprised when they hear that these are the only four components that make a conservation drone, but they are even more surprised when I tell them how affordable these components are. The facts is, a conservation drone doesn't cost very much more than a good laptop computer or a decent pair of binoculars.So now that you've built your own conservation drone, you probably want to go fly it, but how does one fly a drone? Well, actually, you don't, because the drone flies itself. All you have to do is to program a mission to tell the drone where to fly. But you simply do that by clicking on a few way points on the Google Maps interface using the open-source software. Those missions could be as simple as just a few way points, or they could be slightly longer and more complicated, to fly along a river system. Sometimes, we fly the drone in a lawnmower-type pattern and take pictures of that area, and those pictures can be processed to produce a map of that forest. Other researchers might want to fly the drone along the boundaries of a forest to watch out for poachers or people who might be trying to enter the forest illegally.Now whatever your mission is, once you've programmed it, you simply upload it to the autopilot system, bring your drone to the field, and launch it simply by tossing it in the air. And often we'll go about this mission taking pictures or videos along the way, and usually at that point, we will go grab ourselves a cup of coffee, sit back, and relax for the next few minutes, although some of us sit back and panic for the next few minutes worrying that the drone will not return. Usually it does, and when it does, it even lands automatically.So what can we do with a conservation drone? Well, when we built our first prototype drone, our main objective was to fly it over a remote rainforest in North Sumatra, Indonesia, to look for the nest of a species of great ape known as the orangutan. The reason we wanted to do that was because we needed to know how many individuals of this species are still left in that forest. Now the traditional method of surveying for orangutans is to walk the forest on foot carrying heavy equipment and to use a pair of binoculars to look up in the treetops where you might find an orangutan or its nest. Now as you can imagine, that is a very time-consuming, labor-intensive, and costly process, so we were hoping that drones could significantly reduce the cost of surveying for orangutan populations in Indonesia and elsewhere in Southeast Asia. So we were very excited when we captured our first pair of orangutan nests on camera. And this is it; this is the first ever picture of orangutan nests taken with a drone. Since then we have taken pictures of dozens of these nests from around various parts of Southeast Asia, and we're now working with computer scientists to develop algorithms that can automatically count the number of nests from the thousands of photos we've collected so far.But nests are not the only objects these drones can detect. This is a wild orangutan happily feeding on top of a palm tree, seemingly oblivious to our drone that was flying overhead, not once but several times. We've also taken pictures of other animals including forest buffalos in Gabon, elephants, and even turtle nests.But besides taking pictures of just the animals themselves, we also take pictures of the habitats these animals live in, because we want to keep track of the health of these habitats. Sometimes, we zoom out a little and look at other things that might be happening in the landscape. This is an oil palm plantation in Sumatra. Now oil palm is a major driver of deforestation in that part of the world, so we wanted to use this new drone technology to keep track of the spread of these plantations in Southeast Asia. But drones could also be used to keep track of illegal logging activities. This is a recently logged forest, again in Sumatra. You could even still see the processed wooden planks left on the ground.But perhaps the most exciting part about taking pictures from the air is we could later stitch these pictures together using special software to create a map of the entire landscape, and this map gives us crucial information for monitoring land use change, to let us know where and when plantations might be expanding, where forests might be contracting, or where fires might be breaking out. Aerial images could also be processed to produce three-dimensional computer models of forests. Now these models are not just visually appealing, but they are also geometrically accurate, which means researchers can now measure the distance between trees, calculate surface area, the volume of vegetation, and so on, all of which are important information for monitoring the health of these forests. Recently, we've also begun experimenting with thermal imaging cameras. Now these cameras can detect heat-emitting objects from the ground, and therefore they are very useful for detecting poachers or their campfires at night.So I've told you quite a lot about what conservation drones are, how you might operate one of these drones, and what a drone could do for you. I will now tell you where conservation drones are being used around the world. We built our first prototype drones in Switzerland. We brought a few of these to Indonesia for the first few test flights. Since then, we've been building drones for our collaborators from around the world, and these include fellow biologists and partners from major conservation organizations.Perhaps the best and most rewarding part about working with these collaborators is the feedback they give us on how to improve our drones. Building drones for us is a constant work in progress. We are constantly trying to improve them in terms of their range, their ruggedness, and the amount of payload they can carry. We also work with collaborators to discover new ways of using these drones. For example, camera traps are a common tool used by biologists to take pictures of shy animals hiding in the forests, but these are motion-activated cameras, so they snap a picture every time an animal crosses their path. But the problem with camera traps is that the researcher has to go back to the forest every so often to retrieve those images, and that takes a lot of time, especially if there are dozens or hundreds of these cameras placed in the forest. Now a drone could be designed to perform the task much more efficiently. This drone, carrying a special sensor, could be flown over the forest and remotely download these images from wi-fi\u2013enabled cameras.Radio collars are another tool that's commonly used by biologists. Now these collars are put onto animals. They transmit a radio signal which allows the researcher to track the movements of these animals across the landscape. But the traditional way of tracking animals is pretty ridiculous, because it requires the researcher to be walking on the ground carrying a huge and cumbersome radio antenna, not unlike those old TV antennae we used to have on our rooftops. Some of us still do. A drone could be used to do the same job much more efficiently. Why not equip a drone with a scanning radio receiver, fly that over the forest canopy in a certain pattern which would allow the user or the operator to triangulate the location of these radio-collared animals remotely without having to step foot in the forest.A third and perhaps most exciting way of using these drones is to fly them to a really remote, never-explored-before rainforest somewhere hidden in the tropics, and parachute down a tiny spy microphone that would allow us to eavesdrop on the calls of mammals, birds, amphibians, the Yeti, the Sasquatch, Bigfoot, whatever. That would give us biologists a pretty good idea of what animals might be living in those forests.And finally, I would like to show you the latest version of our conservation drone. The MAJA drone has a wingspan of about two meters. It weighs only about two kilograms, but it can carry half its weight. It is a fully autonomous system. During its mission, it can even transmit a live video feed back to a ground station laptop, which allows the user to see what the drone is seeing in real time. It carries a variety of sensors, and the photo quality of some of these sensors can be as high as one to two centimeters per pixel. This drone can stay in the air for 40 to 60 minutes, which gives it a range of up to 50 kilometers. That is quite sufficient for most of our conservation applications.Now, conservation drones began as a crazy idea from two biologists who are just deeply passionate about this technology. And we believe, strongly believe, that drones can and will be a game changer for conservation research and applications. We've had our fair share of skeptics and critics who thought that we were just fooling around with toy planes. And in a way, they are right. I mean, let's be honest, drones are the ultimate toys for boys. But at the same time, we've also gotten to know many wonderful colleagues and collaborators who share our vision and see the potential of conservation drones. To us, it is obvious that conservation biologists and practitioners should make full use of every available tool, including drones, in our fight to save the last remaining forests and wildlife of this planet.Thank you.(Applause)", "id": 1872, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:13.318 --> 00:00:15.250\nWhen we think of Nepal,\n\n00:00:15.250 -->

a great diversity of wildlife,\n\n00:00:36.691 --> 00:00:39.427\nincluding the one-horned rhinoceros,\n\n00:00:39.427 --> 00:00:41.101\nthe Asian elephant\n\n00:00:41.101 --> 00:00:43.176\nand the

ways to help with protecting the forests\n\n00:01:18.165 --> 00:01:20.142\nand wildlife.\n\n00:01:20.142 --> 00:01:22.651\nWell recently, Nepal acquired a new tool\n\n00:01:22.651 --> 00:01:25.364\nin the fight against wildlife crime,\n\n00:01:25.364 --> 00:01:27.070\nand these are drones,\n\n00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:30.344\nor more specifically, conservation drones.\n\n00:01:30.344 --> 00:01:32.858\nFor about a year now, my colleagues and I\n\n00:01:32.858 --> 00:01:35.118\nhave been building drones for Nepal\n\n00:01:35.118 --> 00:01:37.616\nand training the park protection

00:01:54.226\nThis, for example, is a pair of rhinoceros\n\n00:01:54.226 --> 00:01:57.163\ntaking a cooling bath on a hot summer day\n\n00:01:57.163 --> 00:01:59.126\nin the lowlands of Nepal.\n\n00:01:59.126 --> 00:02:01.357\nNow we believe that drones have\n\n00:02:01.357 --> 00:02:03.165\ntremendous potential,\n\n00:02:03.165 --> 00:02:05.943\nnot only for combating wildlife

drone?\n\n00:02:12.295 --> 00:02:14.804\nWell, the kind of drone I'm talking about\n\n00:02:14.804 --> 00:02:16.905\nis simply a model aircraft\n\n00:02:16.905 --> 00:02:19.350\nfitted with an autopilot system,\n\n00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:23.619\nand this autopilot unit contains a tiny computer,\n\n00:02:23.619 --> 00:02:27.673\na GPS, a compass, a barometric altimeter\n\n00:02:27.673 --> 00:02:29.932\nand a few other sensors.\n\n00:02:29.932 --> 00:02:31.351\nNow a drone like this\n\n00:02:31.351 --> 00:02:33.557\nis meant to carry a useful payload,\n\n00:02:33.557 --> 00:02:35.340\nsuch as a video camera\n\n00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:37.328\nor a photographic camera.\n\n00:02:37.328 --> 00:02:40.677\nIt also requires a software that allows the user\n\n00:02:40.677 --> 00:02:42.378\nto program a mission,\n\n00:02:42.378 --> 00:02:44.784\nto tell the drone where to go.\n\n00:02:44.784 --> 00:02:46.861\nNow people I talk to are often surprised\n\n00:02:46.861 --> 00:02:49.192\nwhen they hear that these are the only\n\n00:02:49.192 --> 00:02:52.299\nfour components that make a conservation drone,\n\n00:02:52.299 --> 00:02:53.803\nbut they are even more surprised\n\n00:02:53.803 --> 00:02:57.303\nwhen I tell them how affordable\nthese components are.\n\n00:02:57.303 --> 00:02:59.589\nThe facts is, a conservation drone\n\n00:02:59.589 --> 00:03:01.848\ndoesn't cost very much more than\n\n00:03:01.848 --> 00:03:03.825\na good laptop computer\n\n00:03:03.825 --> 00:03:07.084\nor a decent pair of binoculars.\n\n00:03:07.084 --> 00:03:10.056\nSo now that you've built\nyour own conservation drone,\n\n00:03:10.056 --> 00:03:12.218\nyou probably want to go fly it,\n\n00:03:12.218 --> 00:03:14.151\nbut how does one fly a drone?\n\n00:03:14.151 --> 00:03:15.743\nWell, actually, you don't,\n\n00:03:15.743 --> 00:03:18.233\nbecause the drone flies itself.\n\n00:03:18.233 --> 00:03:21.363\nAll you have to do is to program a mission\n\n00:03:21.363 --> 00:03:23.623\nto tell the drone where to fly.\n\n00:03:23.623 --> 00:03:25.942\nBut you simply do that by clicking on\n\n00:03:25.942 --> 00:03:29.191\na few way points

just a few way points,\n\n00:03:35.414 --> 00:03:38.791\nor they could be slightly longer\nand more complicated,\n\n00:03:38.791 --> 00:03:41.212\nto fly along a river system.\n\n00:03:41.212 --> 00:03:45.061\nSometimes, we fly the drone\nin a lawnmower-type pattern\n\n00:03:45.061 --> 00:03:47.181\nand take pictures of that area,\n\n00:03:47.181 --> 00:03:49.152\nand those pictures can be processed\n\n00:03:49.152 --> 00:03:51.891\nto produce a map of that forest.\n\n00:03:51.891 --> 00:03:54.494\nOther researchers might want to fly the drone\n\n00:03:54.494 --> 00:03:56.636\nalong the boundaries of a forest\n\n00:03:56.636 --> 00:03:58.807\nto watch out for poachers or people\n\n00:03:58.807 --> 00:04:01.725\nwho might be trying to enter the forest illegally.\n\n00:04:01.725 --> 00:04:03.605\nNow whatever your mission is,\n\n00:04:03.605 --> 00:04:05.078\nonce you've programmed it,\n\n00:04:05.078 --> 00:04:08.061\nyou simply upload it to the autopilot system,\n\n00:04:08.061 --> 00:04:09.701\nbring your drone to the field,\n\n00:04:09.701 --> 00:04:12.916\nand launch it simply by tossing it in the air.\n\n00:04:12.916 --> 00:04:15.258\nAnd often we'll go about this mission\n\n00:04:15.258 --> 00:04:18.318\ntaking pictures or videos along the way,\n\n00:04:18.318 --> 00:04:20.252\nand usually at that point,\n\n00:04:20.252 --> 00:04:22.469\nwe will go grab ourselves a cup of coffee,\n\n00:04:22.469 --> 00:04:25.399\nsit back, and relax for the next few minutes,\n\n00:04:25.399 --> 00:04:28.910\nalthough some of us sit back\nand panic for the next few minutes\n\n00:04:28.910 --> 00:04:31.128\nworrying that the drone will not return.\n\n00:04:31.128 --> 00:04:33.401\nUsually it does, and when it does,\n\n00:04:33.401 --> 00:04:36.807\nit even lands automatically.\n\n00:04:36.807 --> 00:04:39.714\nSo what can we do with a conservation drone?\n\n00:04:39.714 --> 00:04:43.107\nWell, when we built our first prototype drone,\n\n00:04:43.107 --> 00:04:45.625\nour main objective was to fly it over\n\n00:04:45.625 --> 00:04:49.514\na remote rainforest in North Sumatra, Indonesia,\n\n00:04:49.514 --> 00:04:52.563\nto look for the nest of a species of great ape\n\n00:04:52.563 --> 00:04:54.719\nknown as the orangutan.\n\n00:04:54.719 --> 00:04:57.375\nThe reason we wanted to do that was because\n\n00:04:57.375 --> 00:04:59.404\nwe needed to know how many individuals\n\n00:04:59.404 --> 00:05:02.791\nof this species are still left in that forest.\n\n00:05:02.791 --> 00:05:04.977\nNow the traditional method of surveying\n\n00:05:04.977 --> 00:05:08.579\nfor orangutans is to walk the forest on foot\n\n00:05:08.579 --> 00:05:10.466\ncarrying heavy equipment\n\n00:05:10.466 --> 00:05:14.116\nand to use a pair of binoculars\nto look up in the treetops\n\n00:05:14.116 --> 00:05:17.534\nwhere you might find an orangutan or its nest.\n\n00:05:17.534 --> 00:05:19.260\nNow as you can imagine,\n\n00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:22.230\nthat is a very time-consuming, labor-intensive,\n\n00:05:22.230 --> 00:05:23.948\nand costly process,\n\n00:05:23.948 --> 00:05:25.744\nso we were hoping that drones\n\n00:05:25.744 --> 00:05:29.069\ncould significantly reduce the cost of surveying\n\n00:05:29.069 --> 00:05:31.636\nfor orangutan populations in Indonesia\n\n00:05:31.636 --> 00:05:34.103\nand elsewhere in Southeast Asia.\n\n00:05:34.103 --> 00:05:36.458\nSo we were very excited when we captured\n\n00:05:36.458 --> 00:05:39.628\nour first pair of orangutan nests on camera.\n\n00:05:39.628 --> 00:05:42.792\nAnd this is it; this is the first ever picture\n\n00:05:42.792 --> 00:05:45.832\nof orangutan nests taken with a drone.\n\n00:05:45.832 --> 00:05:47.856\nSince then we have taken pictures\n\n00:05:47.856 --> 00:05:49.474\nof dozens of these nests\n\n00:05:49.474 --> 00:05:52.243\nfrom around various parts of Southeast Asia,\n\n00:05:52.243 --> 00:05:54.486\nand we're now working with computer scientists\n\n00:05:54.486 --> 00:05:58.405\nto develop algorithms that can automatically count\n\n00:05:58.405 --> 00:06:00.422\nthe number of nests from the thousands\n\n00:06:00.422 --> 00:06:03.541\nof photos we've collected so far.\n\n00:06:03.541 --> 00:06:05.499\nBut nests are not the only objects\n\n00:06:05.499 --> 00:06:07.289\nthese drones can detect.\n\n00:06:07.289 --> 00:06:09.598\nThis is a wild orangutan\n\n00:06:09.598 --> 00:06:12.119\nhappily feeding on top of a palm tree,\n\n00:06:12.119 --> 00:06:15.671\nseemingly oblivious to our drone\nthat was flying overhead,\n\n00:06:15.671 --> 00:06:18.055\nnot once but several times.\n\n00:06:18.055 --> 00:06:21.073\nWe've also taken pictures of other animals\n\n00:06:21.073 --> 00:06:24.194\nincluding forest buffalos in Gabon,\n\n00:06:24.194 --> 00:06:27.409\nelephants, and even turtle nests.\n\n00:06:27.409 --> 00:06:30.949\nBut besides taking pictures\nof just the animals themselves,\n\n00:06:30.949 --> 00:06:34.950\nwe also take pictures of the habitats\nthese animals live in,\n\n00:06:34.950 --> 00:06:36.564\nbecause we want to keep track\n\n00:06:36.564 --> 00:06:39.518\nof the health of these habitats.\n\n00:06:39.518 --> 00:06:41.737\nSometimes, we zoom out a little\n\n00:06:41.737 --> 00:06:43.990\nand look at other things that might be happening\n\n00:06:43.990 --> 00:06:45.454\nin the landscape.\n\n00:06:45.454 --> 00:06:48.754\nThis is an oil palm plantation in Sumatra.\n\n00:06:48.754 --> 00:06:51.996\nNow oil palm is a major driver of deforestation\n\n00:06:51.996 --> 00:06:53.518\nin that part of the world,\n\n00:06:53.518 --> 00:06:56.575\nso we wanted to use this new drone technology\n\n00:06:56.575 --> 00:06:59.690\nto keep track of the spread of these plantations\n\n00:06:59.690 --> 00:07:01.700\nin Southeast Asia.\n\n00:07:01.700 --> 00:07:04.063\nBut drones could also be used to keep track of\n\n00:07:04.063 --> 00:07:06.547\nillegal logging activities.\n\n00:07:06.547 --> 00:07:08.988\nThis is a recently logged forest,\n\n00:07:08.988 --> 00:07:10.343\nagain in Sumatra.\n\n00:07:10.343 --> 00:07:12.502\nYou could even still see the processed\n\n00:07:12.502 --> 00:07:16.130\nwooden planks left on the ground.\n\n00:07:16.130 --> 00:07:18.419\nBut perhaps the most exciting part\n\n00:07:18.419 --> 00:07:20.985\nabout taking pictures from the air is\n\n00:07:20.985 --> 00:07:23.411\nwe could later stitch these pictures together\n\n00:07:23.411 --> 00:07:26.274\nusing special software to create a map\n\n00:07:26.274 --> 00:07:29.041\nof the entire landscape, and this map\n\n00:07:29.041 --> 00:07:31.056\ngives us crucial information\n\n00:07:31.056 --> 00:07:33.324\nfor monitoring land use change,\n\n00:07:33.324 --> 00:07:37.071\nto let us know where and when\nplantations might be expanding,\n\n00:07:37.071 --> 00:07:39.348\nwhere forests might be contracting,\n\n00:07:39.348 --> 00:07:42.730\nor where fires might be breaking out.\n\n00:07:42.730 --> 00:07:44.962\nAerial images could also be processed\n\n00:07:44.962 --> 00:07:47.271\nto produce three-dimensional\n\n00:07:47.271 --> 00:07:49.268\ncomputer models of forests.\n\n00:07:49.268 --> 00:07:52.221\nNow these models are not just visually appealing,\n\n00:07:52.221 --> 00:07:54.722\nbut they are also geometrically accurate,\n\n00:07:54.722 --> 00:07:57.499\nwhich means researchers can now measure\n\n00:07:57.499 --> 00:07:59.624\nthe distance between trees,\n\n00:07:59.624 --> 00:08:02.919\ncalculate surface area, the volume of vegetation,\n\n00:08:02.919 --> 00:08:06.118\nand so on, all of which are important information\n\n00:08:06.118 --> 00:08:09.431\nfor monitoring the health of these forests.\n\n00:08:09.431 --> 00:08:11.884\nRecently, we've also begun experimenting\n\n00:08:11.884 --> 00:08:13.948\nwith thermal imaging cameras.\n\n00:08:13.948 --> 00:08:15.837\nNow these cameras can detect\n\n00:08:15.837 --> 00:08:17.811\nheat-emitting objects from the ground,\n\n00:08:17.822 --> 00:08:25.194\nand therefore they are very useful\nfor detecting poachers or their campfires at night.\n\n00:08:25.194 --> 00:08:27.078\nSo I've told you quite a lot about\n\n00:08:27.078 --> 00:08:29.294\nwhat conservation drones are,\n\n00:08:29.294 --> 00:08:31.611\nhow you might operate one of these drones,\n\n00:08:31.611 --> 00:08:33.620\nand what a drone could do for you.\n\n00:08:33.620 --> 00:08:35.856\nI will now tell you where conservation drones\n\n00:08:35.856 --> 00:08:38.311\nare being used around the world.\n\n00:08:38.311 --> 00:08:41.364\nWe built our first prototype drones in Switzerland.\n\n00:08:41.364 --> 00:08:43.505\nWe brought a few of these to Indonesia\n\n00:08:43.505 --> 00:08:45.648\nfor the first few test flights.\n\n00:08:45.648 --> 00:08:47.463\nSince then, we've been building drones\n\n00:08:47.463 --> 00:08:50.145\nfor our collaborators from around the world,\n\n00:08:50.145 --> 00:08:52.325\nand these include fellow biologists\n\n00:08:52.325 --> 00:08:56.253\nand partners from major conservation organizations.\n\n00:08:56.253 --> 00:08:58.543\nPerhaps the best and most rewarding part\n\n00:08:58.543 --> 00:09:00.669\nabout working with these collaborators\n\n00:09:00.669 --> 00:09:02.149\nis the feedback they give us\n\n00:09:02.149 --> 00:09:04.792\non how to improve our drones.\n\n00:09:04.792 --> 00:09:06.923\nBuilding drones for us is\n\n00:09:06.923 --> 00:09:09.087\na constant work in progress.\n\n00:09:09.087 --> 00:09:12.164\nWe are constantly trying to improve them in terms of\n\n00:09:12.164 --> 00:09:14.778\ntheir range, their ruggedness,\n\n00:09:14.778 --> 00:09:17.456\nand the amount of payload they can carry.\n\n00:09:17.456 --> 00:09:19.498\nWe also work with collaborators\n\n00:09:19.498 --> 00:09:22.785\nto discover new ways of using these drones.\n\n00:09:22.785 --> 00:09:26.065\nFor example, camera traps are a common tool\n\n00:09:26.065 --> 00:09:29.960\nused by biologists to take pictures of shy animals\n\n00:09:29.960 --> 00:09:31.521\nhiding in the forests,\n\n00:09:31.521 --> 00:09:33.855\nbut these are motion-activated cameras,\n\n00:09:33.855 --> 00:09:36.496\nso they snap a picture every time an animal\n\n00:09:36.496 --> 00:09:38.168\ncrosses their path.\n\n00:09:38.168 --> 00:09:39.720\nBut the problem with camera traps\n\n00:09:39.720 --> 00:09:43.463\nis that the researcher has to go back to the forest\n\n00:09:43.463 --> 00:09:46.916\nevery so often to retrieve those images,\n\n00:09:46.916 --> 00:09:48.568\nand that takes a lot of time,\n\n00:09:48.568 --> 00:09:50.402\nespecially if there are dozens\n\n00:09:50.402 --> 00:09:53.530\nor hundreds of these cameras placed in the forest.\n\n00:09:53.530 --> 00:09:56.341\nNow a drone could be designed to perform the task\n\n00:09:56.341 --> 00:09:58.065\nmuch more efficiently.\n\n00:09:58.065 --> 00:10:00.735\nThis drone, carrying a special sensor,\n\n00:10:00.735 --> 00:10:03.076\ncould be flown over the forest\n\n00:10:03.076 --> 00:10:05.823\nand remotely download these images\n\n00:10:05.823 --> 00:10:09.960\nfrom wi-fi\u2013enabled cameras.\n\n00:10:09.960 --> 00:10:12.097\nRadio collars are another tool\n\n00:10:12.097 --> 00:10:14.345\nthat's commonly used by biologists.\n\n00:10:14.345 --> 00:10:17.012\nNow these collars are put onto animals.\n\n00:10:17.012 --> 00:10:19.813\nThey transmit a radio signal which allows\n\n00:10:19.813 --> 00:10:24.960\nthe researcher to track the movements\nof these animals across the landscape.\n\n00:10:24.960 --> 00:10:27.617\nBut the traditional way of tracking animals\n\n00:10:27.617 --> 00:10:29.839\nis pretty ridiculous,\n\n00:10:29.839 --> 00:10:32.783\nbecause it requires the researcher to be walking\n\n00:10:32.783 --> 00:10:36.897\non the ground carrying a huge\nand cumbersome radio antenna,\n\n00:10:36.897 --> 00:10:39.770\nnot unlike those old TV antennae we used to have\n\n00:10:39.770 --> 00:10:42.738\non our rooftops. Some of us still do.\n\n00:10:42.738 --> 00:10:45.003\nA drone could be used to do the same job\n\n00:10:45.003 --> 00:10:46.662\nmuch more efficiently.\n\n00:10:46.662 --> 00:10:48.368\nWhy not equip a drone\n\n00:10:48.368 --> 00:10:50.371\nwith a scanning radio receiver,\n\n00:10:50.371 --> 00:10:52.365\nfly that over the forest canopy\n\n00:10:52.365 --> 00:10:53.903\nin a certain pattern\n\n00:10:53.903 --> 00:10:56.695\nwhich would allow the user or the operator\n\n00:10:56.695 --> 00:10:59.277\nto triangulate the location\n\n00:10:59.277 --> 00:11:02.264\nof these radio-collared animals remotely\n\n00:11:02.264 --> 00:11:05.237\nwithout having to step foot in the forest.\n\n00:11:05.237 --> 00:11:07.740\nA third and perhaps most exciting way\n\n00:11:07.740 --> 00:11:09.270\nof using these drones\n\n00:11:09.270 --> 00:11:12.220\nis to fly them to a really remote,\n\n00:11:12.220 --> 00:11:14.496\nnever-explored-before rainforest\n\n00:11:14.496 --> 00:11:16.320\nsomewhere hidden in the tropics,\n\n00:11:16.320 --> 00:11:20.253\nand parachute down a tiny spy microphone\n\n00:11:20.253 --> 00:11:22.699\nthat would allow us to eavesdrop on the calls\n\n00:11:22.699 --> 00:11:26.021\nof mammals, birds, amphibians,\n\n00:11:26.021 --> 00:11:30.298\nthe Yeti, the Sasquatch, Bigfoot, whatever.\n\n00:11:30.298 --> 00:11:32.037\nThat would give us biologists\n\n00:11:32.037 --> 00:11:33.923\na pretty good idea of what animals\n\n00:11:33.923 --> 00:11:36.473\nmight be living in those forests.\n\n00:11:36.473 --> 00:11:38.522\nAnd finally, I would like to show you\n\n00:11:38.522 --> 00:11:41.623\nthe latest version of our conservation drone.\n\n00:11:41.623 --> 00:11:43.762\nThe MAJA drone has a wingspan\n\n00:11:43.762 --> 00:11:45.436\nof about two meters.\n\n00:11:45.436 --> 00:11:47.386\nIt weighs only about two kilograms,\n\n00:11:47.386 --> 00:11:49.847\nbut it can carry half its weight.\n\n00:11:49.847 --> 00:11:52.442\nIt is a fully autonomous system.\n\n00:11:52.442 --> 00:11:54.829\nDuring its mission, it can even transmit\n\n00:11:54.829 --> 00:11:58.792\na live video feed back to a ground station laptop,\n\n00:11:58.792 --> 00:12:00.335\nwhich allows the user\n\n00:12:00.335 --> 00:12:03.265\nto see what the drone is seeing in real time.\n\n00:12:03.265 --> 00:12:05.687\nIt carries a variety of sensors,\n\n00:12:05.687 --> 00:12:08.025\nand the photo quality of some of these sensors\n\n00:12:08.025 --> 00:12:12.235\ncan be as high as one to two centimeters per pixel.\n\n00:12:12.235 --> 00:12:15.916\nThis drone can stay in the air for 40 to 60 minutes,\n\n00:12:15.916 --> 00:12:19.040\nwhich gives it a range of up to 50 kilometers.\n\n00:12:19.040 --> 00:12:20.955\nThat is quite sufficient for most\n\n00:12:20.955 --> 00:12:23.954\nof our conservation applications.\n\n00:12:23.954 --> 00:12:26.024\nNow, conservation drones began as\n\n00:12:26.024 --> 00:12:28.215\na crazy idea from two biologists\n\n00:12:28.215 --> 00:12:31.500\nwho are just deeply passionate\nabout this technology.\n\n00:12:31.500 --> 00:12:33.650\nAnd we believe, strongly believe,\n\n00:12:33.650 --> 00:12:36.997\nthat drones can and will be a game changer\n\n00:12:36.997 --> 00:12:40.031\nfor conservation research and applications.\n\n00:12:40.031 --> 00:12:43.206\nWe've had our fair share of skeptics and critics\n\n00:12:43.206 --> 00:12:46.727\nwho thought that we were just\nfooling around with toy planes.\n\n00:12:46.727 --> 00:12:48.153\nAnd in a way, they are right.\n\n00:12:48.153 --> 00:12:49.782\nI mean, let's be honest,\n\n00:12:49.782 --> 00:12:53.470\ndrones are the ultimate toys for boys.\n\n00:12:53.470 --> 00:12:55.876\nBut at the same time, we've also gotten to know\n\n00:12:55.876 --> 00:12:58.125\nmany wonderful colleagues and collaborators\n\n00:12:58.125 --> 00:12:59.673\nwho share our vision\n\n00:12:59.673 --> 00:13:02.529\nand see the potential of conservation drones.\n\n00:13:02.529 --> 00:13:06.128\nTo us, it is obvious that conservation biologists\n\n00:13:06.128 --> 00:13:08.386\nand practitioners should make full use\n\n00:13:08.386 --> 00:13:11.920\nof every available tool, including drones,\n\n00:13:11.920 --> 00:13:14.561\nin our fight to save the last remaining forests\n\n00:13:14.561 --> 00:13:16.348\nand wildlife of this planet.\n\n00:13:16.348 --> 00:13:18.346\nThank you.\n\n00:13:18.346 --> 00:13:24.068\n(Applause)"}, {"title": "Ecology from the air", "duration": "830", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/greg_asner_ecology_from_the_air", "transcript": "Technology can change our understanding of nature.Take for example the case of lions. For centuries, it's been said that female lions do all of the hunting out in the open savanna, and male lions do nothing until it's time for dinner. You've heard this too, I can tell. Well recently, I led an airborne mapping campaign in the Kruger National Park in South Africa. Our colleagues put GPS tracking collars on male and female lions, and we mapped their hunting behavior from the air. The lower left shows a lion sizing up a herd of impala for a kill, and the right shows what I call the lion viewshed. That's how far the lion can see in all directions until his or her view is obstructed by vegetation. And what we found is that male lions are not the lazy hunters we thought them to be. They just use a different strategy. Whereas the female lions hunt out in the open savanna over long distances, usually during the day, male lions use an ambush strategy in dense vegetation, and often at night. This video shows the actual hunting viewsheds of male lions on the left and females on the right. Red and darker colors show more dense vegetation, and the white are wide open spaces. And this is the viewshed right literally at the eye level of hunting male and female lions. All of a sudden, you get a very clear understanding of the very spooky conditions under which male lions do their hunting.I bring up this example to begin, because it emphasizes how little we know about nature. There's been a huge amount of work done so far to try to slow down our losses of tropical forests, and we are losing our forests at a rapid rate, as shown in red on the slide. I find it ironic that we're doing so much, yet these areas are fairly unknown to science. So how can we save what we don't understand?Now I'm a global ecologist and an Earth explorer with a background in physics and chemistry and biology and a lot of other boring subjects, but above all, I'm obsessed with what we don't know about our planet. So I created this, the Carnegie Airborne Observatory, or CAO. It may look like a plane with a fancy paint job, but I packed it with over 1,000 kilos of high-tech sensors, computers, and a very motivated staff of Earth scientists and pilots. Two of our instruments are very unique: one is called an imaging spectrometer that can actually measure the chemical composition of plants as we fly over them. Another one is a set of lasers, very high-powered lasers, that fire out of the bottom of the plane, sweeping across the ecosystem and measuring it at nearly 500,000 times per second in high-resolution 3D. Here's an image of the Golden Gate Bridge in San Francisco, not far from where I live. Although we flew straight over this bridge, we imaged it in 3D, captured its color in just a few seconds. But the real power of the CAO is its ability to capture the actual building blocks of ecosystems. This is a small town in the Amazon, imaged with the CAO. We can slice through our data and see, for example, the 3D structure of the vegetation and the buildings, or we can use the chemical information to actually figure out how fast the plants are growing as we fly over them. The hottest pinks are the fastest-growing plants. And we can see biodiversity in ways that you never could have imagined. This is what a rainforest might look like as you fly over it in a hot air balloon. This is how we see a rainforest, in kaleidoscopic color that tells us that there are many species living with one another. But you have to remember that these trees are literally bigger than whales, and what that means is that they're impossible to understand just by walking on the ground below them. So our imagery is 3D, it's chemical, it's biological, and this tells us not only the species that are living in the canopy, but it tells us a lot of information about the rest of the species that occupy the rainforest.Now I created the CAO in order to answer questions that have proven extremely challenging to answer from any other vantage point, such as from the ground, or from satellite sensors. I want to share three of those questions with you today. The first questions is, how do we manage our carbon reserves in tropical forests? Tropical forests contain a huge amount of carbon in the trees, and we need to keep that carbon in those forests if we're going to avoid any further global warming. Unfortunately, global carbon emissions from deforestation now equals the global transportation sector. That's all ships, airplanes, trains  and automobiles combined. So it's understandable that policy negotiators have been working hard to reduce deforestation, but they're doing it on landscapes that are hardly known to science. If you don't know where the carbon is exactly, in detail, how can you know what you're losing? Basically, we need a high-tech accounting system. With our system, we're able to see the carbon stocks of tropical forests in utter detail. The red shows, obviously, closed-canopy tropical forest, and then you see the cookie cutting, or the cutting of the forest in yellows and greens. It's like cutting a cake except this cake is about whale deep. And yet, we can zoom in and see the forest and the trees at the same time. And what's amazing is, even though we flew very high above this forest, later on in analysis, we can go in and actually experience the treetrops, leaf by leaf, branch by branch, just as the other species that live in this forest experience it along with the trees themselves.We've been using the technology to explore and to actually put out the first carbon geographies in high resolution in faraway places like the Amazon Basin and not-so-faraway places like the United States and Central America. What I'm going to do is I'm going to take you on a high-resolution, first-time tour of the carbon landscapes of Peru and then Panama. The colors are going to be going from red to blue. Red is extremely high carbon stocks, your largest cathedral forests you can imagine, and blue are very low carbon stocks. And let me tell you, Peru alone is an amazing place, totally unknown in terms of its carbon geography until today. We can fly to this area in northern Peru and see super high carbon stocks in red, and the Amazon River and floodplain cutting right through it. We can go to an area of utter devastation caused by deforestation in blue, and the virus of deforestation spreading out in orange. We can also fly to the southern Andes to see the tree line and see exactly how the carbon geography ends as we go up into the mountain system. And we can go to the biggest swamp in the western Amazon. It's a watery dreamworld akin to Jim Cameron's \"Avatar.\" We can go to one of the smallest tropical countries, Panama, and see also a huge range of carbon variation, from high in red to low in blue. Unfortunately, most of the carbon is lost in the lowlands, but what you see that's left, in terms of high carbon stocks in greens and reds, is the stuff that's up in the mountains. One interesting exception to this is right in the middle of your screen. You're seeing the buffer zone around the Panama Canal. That's in the reds and yellows. The canal authorities are using force to protect their watershed and global commerce. This kind of carbon mapping has transformed conservation and resource policy development. It's really advancing our ability to save forests and to curb climate change.My second question: How do we prepare for climate change in a place like the Amazon rainforest? Let me tell you, I spend a lot of time in these places, and we're seeing the climate changing already. Temperatures are increasing, and what's really happening is we're getting a lot of droughts, recurring droughts. The 2010 mega-drought is shown here with red showing an area about the size of Western Europe. The Amazon was so dry in 2010 that even the main stem of the Amazon river itself dried up partially, as you see in the photo in the lower portion of the slide. What we found is that in very remote areas, these droughts are having a big negative impact on tropical forests. For example, these are all of the dead trees in red that suffered mortality following the 2010 drought. This area happens to be on the border of Peru and Brazil, totally unexplored, almost totally unknown scientifically.So what we think, as Earth scientists, is species are going to have to migrate with climate change from the east in Brazil all the way west into the Andes and up into the mountains in order to minimize their exposure to climate change. One of the problems with this is that humans are taking apart the western Amazon as we speak. Look at this 100-square-kilometer gash in the forest created by gold miners. You see the forest in green in 3D, and you see the effects of gold mining down below the soil surface. Species have nowhere to migrate in a system like this, obviously.If you haven't been to the Amazon, you should go. It's an amazing experience every time, no matter where you go. You're going to probably see it this way, on a river. But what happens is a lot of times the rivers hide what's really going on back in the forest itself. We flew over this same river, imaged the system in 3D. The forest is on the left. And then we can digitally remove the forest and see what's going on below the canopy. And in this case, we found gold mining activity, all of it illegal, set back away from the river's edge, as you'll see in those strange pockmarks coming up on your screen on the right. Don't worry, we're working with the authorities to deal with this and many, many other problems in the region.So in order to put together a conservation plan for these unique, important corridors like the western Amazon and the Andes Amazon corridor, we have to start making geographically explicit plans now. How do we do that if we don't know the geography of biodiversity in the region, if it's so unknown to science? So what we've been doing is using the laser-guided spectroscopy from the CAO to map for the first time the biodiversity of the Amazon rainforest. Here you see actual data showing different species in different colors. Reds are one type of species, blues are another, and greens are yet another. And when we take this together and scale up to the regional level, we get a completely new geography of biodiversity unknown prior to this work. This tells us where the big biodiversity changes occur from habitat to habitat, and that's really important because it tells us a lot about where species may migrate to and migrate from as the climate shifts. And this is the pivotal information that's needed by decision makers to develop protected areas in the context of their regional development plans.And third and final question is, how do we manage biodiversity on a planet of protected ecosystems? The example I started out with about lions hunting, that was a study we did behind the fence line of a protected area in South Africa. And the truth is, much of Africa's nature is going to persist into the future in protected areas like I show in blue on the screen. This puts incredible pressure and responsibility on park management. They need to do and make decisions that will benefit all of the species that they're protecting. Some of their decisions have really big impacts. For example, how much and where to use fire as a management tool? Or, how to deal with a large species like elephants, which may, if their populations get too large, have a negative impact on the ecosystem and on other species. And let me tell you, these types of dynamics really play out on the landscape. In the foreground is an area with lots of fire and lots of elephants: wide open savanna in blue, and just a few trees. As we cross this fence line, now we're getting into an area that has had protection from fire and zero elephants: dense vegetation, a radically different ecosystem. And in a place like Kruger, the soaring elephant densities are a real problem. I know it's a sensitive issue for many of you, and there are no easy answers with this. But what's good is that the technology we've developed and we're working with in South Africa, for example, is allowing us to map every single tree in the savanna, and then through repeat flights we're able to see which trees are being pushed over by elephants, in the red as you see on the screen, and how much that's happening in different types of landscapes in the savanna. That's giving park managers a very first opportunity to use tactical management strategies that are more nuanced and don't lead to those extremes that I just showed you. So really, the way we're looking at protected areas nowadays is to think of it as tending to a circle of life, where we have fire management, elephant management, those impacts on the structure of the ecosystem, and then those impacts affecting everything from insects up to apex predators like lions.Going forward, I plan to greatly expand the airborne observatory. I'm hoping to actually put the technology into orbit so we can manage the entire planet with technologies like this. Until then, you're going to find me flying in some remote place that you've never heard of. I just want to end by saying that technology is absolutely critical to managing our planet, but even more important is the understanding and wisdom to apply it.Thank you.(Applause)", "id": 1874,

example the case of lions.\n\n00:00:19.802 --> 00:00:21.972\nFor centuries, it's been said that female lions\n\n00:00:21.972 --> 00:00:24.701\ndo all of the hunting out in the open savanna,\n\n00:00:24.701 --> 00:00:28.682\nand male lions do nothing until it's time for dinner.\n\n00:00:28.682 --> 00:00:31.694\nYou've heard this too, I can tell.\n\n00:00:31.694 --> 00:00:34.280\nWell recently, I led an airborne mapping campaign\n\n00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:36.952\nin the Kruger National Park in South Africa.\n\n00:00:36.952 --> 00:00:39.544\nOur colleagues put GPS tracking collars\n\n00:00:39.544 --> 00:00:41.141\non male and female lions,\n\n00:00:41.141 --> 00:00:42.749\nand we mapped their hunting behavior\n\n00:00:42.749 --> 00:00:44.197\nfrom the air.\n\n00:00:44.197 --> 00:00:46.863\nThe lower left shows a lion sizing up\n\n00:00:46.863 --> 00:00:48.875\na herd of impala for a kill,\n\n00:00:48.875 --> 00:00:50.444\nand the right shows what I call\n\n00:00:50.444 --> 00:00:52.307\nthe lion viewshed.\n\n00:00:52.307 --> 00:00:54.929\nThat's how far the lion can see in all directions\n\n00:00:54.929 --> 00:00:59.104\nuntil his or her view is obstructed by vegetation.\n\n00:00:59.104 --> 00:01:00.545\nAnd what we found\n\n00:01:00.545 --> 00:01:03.051\nis that male lions are not the lazy hunters\n\n00:01:03.051 --> 00:01:04.575\nwe thought them to be.\n\n00:01:04.575 --> 00:01:06.712\nThey just use a different strategy.\n\n00:01:06.712 --> 00:01:08.464\nWhereas the female lions hunt\n\n00:01:08.464 --> 00:01:09.596\nout in the open savanna\n\n00:01:09.596 --> 00:01:12.257\nover long distances, usually during the day,\n\n00:01:12.257 --> 00:01:15.267\nmale lions use an ambush strategy\n\n00:01:15.267 --> 00:01:19.000\nin dense vegetation, and often at night.\n\n00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.006\nThis video shows the actual hunting viewsheds\n\n00:01:22.006 --> 00:01:23.871\nof male lions on the left\n\n00:01:23.871 --> 00:01:25.860\nand females on the right.\n\n00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:28.416\nRed and darker colors show more dense vegetation,\n\n00:01:28.416 --> 00:01:30.531\nand the white are wide open spaces.\n\n00:01:30.531 --> 00:01:33.631\nAnd this is the viewshed right literally at the eye level\n\n00:01:33.631 --> 00:01:36.161\nof hunting male and female lions.\n\n00:01:36.161 --> 00:01:38.490\nAll of a sudden, you get a very clear understanding\n\n00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:41.343\nof the very spooky conditions under which\n\n00:01:41.343 --> 00:01:43.423\nmale lions do their hunting.\n\n00:01:43.423 --> 00:01:44.919\nI bring up this example to begin,\n\n00:01:44.919 --> 00:01:49.387\nbecause it emphasizes how little\nwe know about nature.\n\n00:01:49.387 --> 00:01:52.062\nThere's been a huge amount of work done so far\n\n00:01:52.062 --> 00:01:55.690\nto try to slow down our losses of tropical forests,\n\n00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:57.639\nand we are losing our forests at a rapid rate,\n\n00:01:57.639 --> 00:01:59.553\nas shown in red on the slide.\n\n00:01:59.553 --> 00:02:01.893\nI find it ironic that we're doing so much,\n\n00:02:01.893 --> 00:02:05.526\nyet these areas are fairly unknown to science.\n\n00:02:05.526 --> 00:02:08.183\nSo how can we save what we don't understand?\n\n00:02:08.183 --> 00:02:10.845\nNow I'm a global ecologist and an Earth explorer\n\n00:02:10.845 --> 00:02:12.536\nwith a background in physics and chemistry\n\n00:02:12.536 --> 00:02:15.740\nand biology and a lot of other boring subjects,\n\n00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:18.742\nbut above all, I'm obsessed with what we don't know\n\n00:02:18.742 --> 00:02:20.454\nabout our planet.\n\n00:02:20.454 --> 00:02:22.128\nSo I created this,\n\n00:02:22.128 --> 00:02:25.405\nthe Carnegie Airborne Observatory, or CAO.\n\n00:02:25.405 --> 00:02:27.462\nIt may look like a plane with a fancy paint job,\n\n00:02:27.462 --> 00:02:30.222\nbut I packed it with over 1,000 kilos\n\n00:02:30.222 --> 00:02:32.658\nof high-tech sensors, computers,\n\n00:02:32.658 --> 00:02:34.869\nand a very motivated staff\n\n00:02:34.869 --> 00:02:37.338\nof Earth scientists and pilots.\n\n00:02:37.338 --> 00:02:39.198\nTwo of our instruments are very unique:\n\n00:02:39.198 --> 00:02:40.952\none is called an imaging spectrometer\n\n00:02:40.952 --> 00:02:42.814\nthat can actually measure the chemical composition\n\n00:02:42.814 --> 00:02:45.743\nof plants as we fly over them.\n\n00:02:45.743 --> 00:02:47.669\nAnother one is a set of lasers,\n\n00:02:47.669 --> 00:02:49.400\nvery high-powered lasers,\n\n00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:51.360\nthat fire out of the bottom of the plane,\n\n00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:53.232\nsweeping across the ecosystem\n\n00:02:53.232 --> 00:02:57.329\nand measuring it at nearly 500,000 times per second\n\n00:02:57.329 --> 00:02:59.807\nin high-resolution 3D.\n\n00:02:59.807 --> 00:03:01.791\nHere's an image of the Golden Gate Bridge\n\n00:03:01.791 --> 00:03:03.963\nin San Francisco, not far from where I live.\n\n00:03:03.963 --> 00:03:05.766\nAlthough we flew straight over this bridge,\n\n00:03:05.766 --> 00:03:07.422\nwe imaged it in 3D, captured its color\n\n00:03:07.422 --> 00:03:09.469\nin just a few seconds.\n\n00:03:09.469 --> 00:03:11.564\nBut the real power of the CAO\n\n00:03:11.564 --> 00:03:13.739\nis its ability to capture the actual building blocks\n\n00:03:13.739 --> 00:03:15.508\nof ecosystems.\n\n00:03:15.508 --> 00:03:17.207\nThis is a small town in the Amazon,\n\n00:03:17.207 --> 00:03:18.822\nimaged with the CAO.\n\n00:03:18.822 --> 00:03:20.561\nWe can slice through our data\n\n00:03:20.561 --> 00:03:22.825\nand see, for example, the 3D structure\n\n00:03:22.825 --> 00:03:25.158\nof the vegetation and the buildings,\n\n00:03:25.158 --> 00:03:27.067\nor we can use the chemical information\n\n00:03:27.067 --> 00:03:29.798\nto actually figure out how fast the plants are growing\n\n00:03:29.798 --> 00:03:31.141\nas we fly over them.\n\n00:03:31.141 --> 00:03:34.627\nThe hottest pinks are the fastest-growing plants.\n\n00:03:34.627 --> 00:03:36.544\nAnd we can see biodiversity in ways\n\n00:03:36.544 --> 00:03:38.703\nthat you never could have imagined.\n\n00:03:38.703 --> 00:03:40.254\nThis is what a rainforest might look like\n\n00:03:40.254 --> 00:03:42.461\nas you fly over it in a hot air balloon.\n\n00:03:42.461 --> 00:03:44.555\nThis is how we see a rainforest,\n\n00:03:44.555 --> 00:03:46.900\nin kaleidoscopic color that tells us\n\n00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:49.842\nthat there are many species living with one another.\n\n00:03:49.842 --> 00:03:51.766\nBut you have to remember that these trees\n\n00:03:51.766 --> 00:03:54.062\nare literally bigger than whales,\n\n00:03:54.062 --> 00:03:56.974\nand what that means is that\nthey're impossible to understand\n\n00:03:56.974 --> 00:03:59.949\njust by walking on the ground below them.\n\n00:03:59.949 --> 00:04:04.587\nSo our imagery is 3D, it's chemical, it's biological,\n\n00:04:04.587 --> 00:04:06.345\nand this tells us not only the species\n\n00:04:06.345 --> 00:04:08.229\nthat are living in the canopy,\n\n00:04:08.229 --> 00:04:10.149\nbut it tells us a lot of information\n\n00:04:10.149 --> 00:04:13.725\nabout the rest of the species\nthat occupy the rainforest.\n\n00:04:13.725 --> 00:04:15.856\nNow I created the CAO\n\n00:04:15.856 --> 00:04:17.995\nin order to answer questions that have proven\n\n00:04:17.995 --> 00:04:21.347\nextremely challenging to answer\nfrom any other vantage point,\n\n00:04:21.347 --> 00:04:24.224\nsuch as from the ground, or from satellite sensors.\n\n00:04:24.224 --> 00:04:27.461\nI want to share three of those\nquestions with you today.\n\n00:04:27.461 --> 00:04:29.168\nThe first questions is,\n\n00:04:29.168 --> 00:04:30.897\nhow do we manage our carbon reserves\n\n00:04:30.897 --> 00:04:33.653\nin tropical forests?\n\n00:04:33.653 --> 00:04:37.212\nTropical forests contain a huge\namount of carbon in the trees,\n\n00:04:37.212 --> 00:04:39.626\nand we need to keep that carbon in those forests\n\n00:04:39.626 --> 00:04:43.040\nif we're going to avoid any further global warming.\n\n00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:45.266\nUnfortunately, global carbon emissions\n\n00:04:45.266 --> 00:04:47.029\nfrom deforestation\n\n00:04:47.029 --> 00:04:50.204\nnow equals the global transportation sector.\n\n00:04:50.204 --> 00:04:54.507\nThat's all ships, airplanes, trains \nand automobiles combined.\n\n00:04:54.507 --> 00:04:57.598\nSo it's understandable that policy negotiators\n\n00:04:57.598 --> 00:05:00.086\nhave been working hard to reduce deforestation,\n\n00:05:00.086 --> 00:05:01.957\nbut they're doing it on landscapes\n\n00:05:01.957 --> 00:05:04.096\nthat are hardly known to science.\n\n00:05:04.096 --> 00:05:06.457\nIf you don't know where the carbon is exactly,\n\n00:05:06.457 --> 00:05:09.309\nin detail, how can you know what you're losing?\n\n00:05:09.309 --> 00:05:13.366\nBasically, we need a high-tech accounting system.\n\n00:05:13.366 --> 00:05:15.682\nWith our system, we're able to see the carbon stocks\n\n00:05:15.682 --> 00:05:18.480\nof tropical forests in utter detail.\n\n00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:21.335\nThe red shows, obviously,\nclosed-canopy tropical forest,\n\n00:05:21.335 --> 00:05:23.353\nand then you see the cookie cutting,\n\n00:05:23.353 --> 00:05:27.260\nor the cutting of the forest in yellows and greens.\n\n00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:30.083\nIt's like cutting a cake except this cake\n\n00:05:30.083 --> 00:05:32.282\nis about whale deep.\n\n00:05:32.282 --> 00:05:34.250\nAnd yet, we can zoom in and see the forest\n\n00:05:34.250 --> 00:05:36.263\nand the trees at the same time.\n\n00:05:36.263 --> 00:05:38.465\nAnd what's amazing is, even though we flew\n\n00:05:38.465 --> 00:05:40.742\nvery high above this forest,\n\n00:05:40.742 --> 00:05:42.645\nlater on in analysis, we can go in\n\n00:05:42.645 --> 00:05:44.865\nand actually experience the treetrops,\n\n00:05:44.865 --> 00:05:47.212\nleaf by leaf, branch by branch,\n\n00:05:47.212 --> 00:05:50.719\njust as the other species that live in this forest\n\n00:05:50.719 --> 00:05:53.536\nexperience it along with the trees themselves.\n\n00:05:53.536 --> 00:05:55.702\nWe've been using the technology to explore\n\n00:05:55.702 --> 00:05:58.572\nand to actually put out the first carbon geographies\n\n00:05:58.572 --> 00:06:00.186\nin high resolution\n\n00:06:00.186 --> 00:06:02.432\nin faraway places like the Amazon Basin\n\n00:06:02.432 --> 00:06:04.719\nand not-so-faraway places like the United States\n\n00:06:04.719 --> 00:06:06.452\nand Central America.\n\n00:06:06.452 --> 00:06:09.952\nWhat I'm going to do is I'm going to take you\non a high-resolution, first-time tour\n\n00:06:09.952 --> 00:06:13.881\nof the carbon landscapes of Peru and then Panama.\n\n00:06:13.881 --> 00:06:16.643\nThe colors are going to be going from red to blue.\n\n00:06:16.643 --> 00:06:18.637\nRed is extremely high carbon stocks,\n\n00:06:18.637 --> 00:06:21.176\nyour largest cathedral forests you can imagine,\n\n00:06:21.176 --> 00:06:23.418\nand blue are very low carbon stocks.\n\n00:06:23.418 --> 00:06:25.852\nAnd let me tell you, Peru alone is an amazing place,\n\n00:06:25.852 --> 00:06:28.241\ntotally unknown in terms of its carbon geography\n\n00:06:28.241 --> 00:06:29.827\nuntil today.\n\n00:06:29.827 --> 00:06:31.673\nWe can fly to this area in northern Peru\n\n00:06:31.673 --> 00:06:33.809\nand see super high carbon stocks in red,\n\n00:06:33.809 --> 00:06:35.298\nand the Amazon River and floodplain\n\n00:06:35.298 --> 00:06:37.043\ncutting right through it.\n\n00:06:37.043 --> 00:06:38.941\nWe can go to an area of utter devastation\n\n00:06:38.941 --> 00:06:40.776\ncaused by deforestation in blue,\n\n00:06:40.776 --> 00:06:44.218\nand the virus of deforestation\nspreading out in orange.\n\n00:06:44.218 --> 00:06:46.902\nWe can also fly to the southern Andes\n\n00:06:46.902 --> 00:06:48.752\nto see the tree line and see exactly how\n\n00:06:48.752 --> 00:06:50.668\nthe carbon geography ends\n\n00:06:50.668 --> 00:06:53.374\nas we go up into the mountain system.\n\n00:06:53.374 --> 00:06:56.279\nAnd we can go to the biggest swamp\nin the western Amazon.\n\n00:06:56.279 --> 00:06:57.652\nIt's a watery dreamworld\n\n00:06:57.652 --> 00:06:59.998\nakin to Jim Cameron's \"Avatar.\"\n\n00:06:59.998 --> 00:07:03.302\nWe can go to one of the smallest tropical countries,\n\n00:07:03.302 --> 00:07:05.659\nPanama, and see also a huge range\n\n00:07:05.659 --> 00:07:07.221\nof carbon variation,\n\n00:07:07.221 --> 00:07:09.222\nfrom high in red to low in blue.\n\n00:07:09.222 --> 00:07:12.154\nUnfortunately, most of the carbon\nis lost in the lowlands,\n\n00:07:12.154 --> 00:07:13.700\nbut what you see that's left,\n\n00:07:13.700 --> 00:07:16.433\nin terms of high carbon stocks in greens and reds,\n\n00:07:16.433 --> 00:07:18.547\nis the stuff that's up in the mountains.\n\n00:07:18.547 --> 00:07:20.905\nOne interesting exception to this\n\n00:07:20.905 --> 00:07:22.521\nis right in the middle of your screen.\n\n00:07:22.521 --> 00:07:25.165\nYou're seeing the buffer zone\naround the Panama Canal.\n\n00:07:25.165 --> 00:07:27.078\nThat's in the reds and yellows.\n\n00:07:27.078 --> 00:07:28.818\nThe canal authorities are using force\n\n00:07:28.818 --> 00:07:31.933\nto protect their watershed and global commerce.\n\n00:07:31.933 --> 00:07:33.423\nThis kind of carbon mapping\n\n00:07:33.423 --> 00:07:35.341\nhas transformed conservation\n\n00:07:35.341 --> 00:07:36.937\nand resource policy development.\n\n00:07:36.937 --> 00:07:39.297\nIt's really advancing our ability to save forests\n\n00:07:39.297 --> 00:07:41.672\nand to curb climate change.\n\n00:07:41.672 --> 00:07:45.103\nMy second question: How do we\nprepare for climate change\n\n00:07:45.103 --> 00:07:47.249\nin a place like the Amazon rainforest?\n\n00:07:47.249 --> 00:07:48.902\nLet me tell you, I spend a lot of time\n\n00:07:48.902 --> 00:07:52.127\nin these places, and we're seeing\nthe climate changing already.\n\n00:07:52.127 --> 00:07:53.739\nTemperatures are increasing,\n\n00:07:53.739 --> 00:07:56.371\nand what's really happening is\nwe're getting a lot of droughts,\n\n00:07:56.371 --> 00:07:58.028\nrecurring droughts.\n\n00:07:58.028 --> 00:07:59.845\nThe 2010 mega-drought is shown here\n\n00:07:59.845 --> 00:08:03.295\nwith red showing an area\nabout the size of Western Europe.\n\n00:08:03.295 --> 00:08:05.557\nThe Amazon was so dry in 2010\n\n00:08:05.557 --> 00:08:07.959\nthat even the main stem of the Amazon river itself\n\n00:08:07.959 --> 00:08:10.093\ndried up partially, as you see in the photo\n\n00:08:10.108 --> 00:08:13.514\nin the lower portion of the slide.\n\n00:08:13.514 --> 00:08:16.684\nWhat we found is that in very remote areas,\n\n00:08:16.684 --> 00:08:19.430\nthese droughts are having a big negative impact\n\n00:08:19.430 --> 00:08:21.018\non tropical forests.\n\n00:08:21.018 --> 00:08:23.738\nFor example, these are all of the dead trees in red\n\n00:08:23.738 --> 00:08:26.799\nthat suffered mortality following the 2010 drought.\n\n00:08:26.799 --> 00:08:28.676\nThis area happens to be on the border\n\n00:08:28.676 --> 00:08:30.075\nof Peru and Brazil,\n\n00:08:30.075 --> 00:08:31.611\ntotally unexplored,\n\n00:08:31.611 --> 00:08:34.414\nalmost totally unknown scientifically.\n\n00:08:34.414 --> 00:08:36.880\nSo what we think, as Earth scientists,\n\n00:08:36.880 --> 00:08:38.839\nis species are going to have to migrate\n\n00:08:38.839 --> 00:08:41.631\nwith climate change from the east in Brazil\n\n00:08:41.631 --> 00:08:43.695\nall the way west into the Andes\n\n00:08:43.695 --> 00:08:45.168\nand up into the mountains\n\n00:08:45.168 --> 00:08:48.704\nin order to minimize their\nexposure to climate change.\n\n00:08:48.704 --> 00:08:50.712\nOne of the problems with this is that humans\n\n00:08:50.712 --> 00:08:53.737\nare taking apart the western Amazon as we speak.\n\n00:08:53.737 --> 00:08:55.846\nLook at this 100-square-kilometer gash\n\n00:08:55.846 --> 00:08:58.748\nin the forest created by gold miners.\n\n00:08:58.748 --> 00:09:01.026\nYou see the forest in green in 3D,\n\n00:09:01.026 --> 00:09:02.860\nand you see the effects of gold mining\n\n00:09:02.860 --> 00:09:05.399\ndown below the soil surface.\n\n00:09:05.399 --> 00:09:09.858\nSpecies have nowhere to migrate\nin a system like this, obviously.\n\n00:09:09.858 --> 00:09:12.510\nIf you haven't been to the Amazon, you should go.\n\n00:09:12.510 --> 00:09:14.548\nIt's an amazing experience every time,\n\n00:09:14.548 --> 00:09:16.091\nno matter where you go.\n\n00:09:16.091 --> 00:09:19.487\nYou're going to probably see it this way, on a river.\n\n00:09:19.487 --> 00:09:21.251\nBut what happens is a lot of times\n\n00:09:21.251 --> 00:09:23.103\nthe rivers hide what's really going on\n\n00:09:23.103 --> 00:09:25.868\nback in the forest itself.\n\n00:09:25.868 --> 00:09:27.582\nWe flew over this same river,\n\n00:09:27.582 --> 00:09:29.422\nimaged the system in 3D.\n\n00:09:29.422 --> 00:09:31.238\nThe forest is on the left.\n\n00:09:31.238 --> 00:09:33.224\nAnd then we can digitally remove the forest\n\n00:09:33.224 --> 00:09:35.683\nand see what's going on below the canopy.\n\n00:09:35.683 --> 00:09:38.133\nAnd in this case, we found gold mining activity,\n\n00:09:38.133 --> 00:09:39.370\nall of it illegal,\n\n00:09:39.370 --> 00:09:41.566\nset back away from the river's edge,\n\n00:09:41.566 --> 00:09:43.470\nas you'll see in those strange pockmarks\n\n00:09:43.470 --> 00:09:45.497\ncoming up on your screen on the right.\n\n00:09:45.497 --> 00:09:47.826\nDon't worry, we're working with the authorities\n\n00:09:47.826 --> 00:09:50.277\nto deal with this and many, many other problems\n\n00:09:50.277 --> 00:09:52.887\nin the region.\n\n00:09:52.887 --> 00:09:55.942\nSo in order to put together a conservation plan\n\n00:09:55.942 --> 00:09:57.682\nfor these unique, important corridors\n\n00:09:57.682 --> 00:10:00.669\nlike the western Amazon\nand the Andes Amazon corridor,\n\n00:10:00.669 --> 00:10:02.833\nwe have to start making\n\n00:10:02.833 --> 00:10:05.239\ngeographically explicit plans now.\n\n00:10:05.241 --> 00:10:09.216\nHow do we do that if we don't know\nthe geography of biodiversity in the region,\n\n00:10:09.216 --> 00:10:10.911\nif it's so unknown to science?\n\n00:10:10.911 --> 00:10:12.775\nSo what we've been doing is using\n\n00:10:12.775 --> 00:10:15.748\nthe laser-guided spectroscopy from the CAO\n\n00:10:15.748 --> 00:10:17.972\nto map for the first time the biodiversity\n\n00:10:17.972 --> 00:10:19.551\nof the Amazon rainforest.\n\n00:10:19.551 --> 00:10:23.088\nHere you see actual data showing\ndifferent species in different colors.\n\n00:10:23.088 --> 00:10:25.228\nReds are one type of species, blues are another,\n\n00:10:25.228 --> 00:10:27.573\nand greens are yet another.\n\n00:10:27.573 --> 00:10:29.736\nAnd when we take this together and scale up\n\n00:10:29.736 --> 00:10:31.620\nto the regional level,\n\n00:10:31.620 --> 00:10:34.189\nwe get a completely new geography\n\n00:10:34.189 --> 00:10:38.577\nof biodiversity unknown prior to this work.\n\n00:10:38.577 --> 00:10:40.725\nThis tells us where the big biodiversity changes\n\n00:10:40.725 --> 00:10:42.739\noccur from habitat to habitat,\n\n00:10:42.739 --> 00:10:44.922\nand that's really important because it tells us\n\n00:10:44.922 --> 00:10:47.817\na lot about where species may migrate to\n\n00:10:47.817 --> 00:10:50.700\nand migrate from as the climate shifts.\n\n00:10:50.700 --> 00:10:53.922\nAnd this is the pivotal information that's needed\n\n00:10:53.922 --> 00:10:57.430\nby decision makers to develop protected areas\n\n00:10:57.430 --> 00:11:00.849\nin the context of their regional development plans.\n\n00:11:00.849 --> 00:11:02.746\nAnd third and final question is,\n\n00:11:02.746 --> 00:11:04.854\nhow do we manage biodiversity on a planet\n\n00:11:04.854 --> 00:11:06.832\nof protected ecosystems?\n\n00:11:06.832 --> 00:11:09.583\nThe example I started out\nwith about lions hunting,\n\n00:11:09.583 --> 00:11:11.438\nthat was a study we did\n\n00:11:11.438 --> 00:11:13.430\nbehind the fence line of a protected area\n\n00:11:13.430 --> 00:11:15.162\nin South Africa.\n\n00:11:15.162 --> 00:11:17.160\nAnd the truth is, much of Africa's nature\n\n00:11:17.160 --> 00:11:19.075\nis going to persist into the future\n\n00:11:19.075 --> 00:11:22.321\nin protected areas like I show in blue on the screen.\n\n00:11:22.321 --> 00:11:24.797\nThis puts incredible pressure and responsibility\n\n00:11:24.797 --> 00:11:26.416\non park management.\n\n00:11:26.416 --> 00:11:29.033\nThey need to do and make decisions\n\n00:11:29.033 --> 00:11:32.324\nthat will benefit all of the species\nthat they're protecting.\n\n00:11:32.324 --> 00:11:35.393\nSome of their decisions have really big impacts.\n\n00:11:35.393 --> 00:11:37.469\nFor example, how much and where\n\n00:11:37.469 --> 00:11:40.109\nto use fire as a management tool?\n\n00:11:40.109 --> 00:11:43.334\nOr, how to deal with a large species like elephants,\n\n00:11:43.334 --> 00:11:45.787\nwhich may, if their populations get too large,\n\n00:11:45.787 --> 00:11:47.834\nhave a negative impact on the ecosystem\n\n00:11:47.834 --> 00:11:49.436\nand on other species.\n\n00:11:49.436 --> 00:11:51.929\nAnd let me tell you, these types of dynamics\n\n00:11:51.929 --> 00:11:53.877\nreally play out on the landscape.\n\n00:11:53.877 --> 00:11:56.338\nIn the foreground is an area with lots of fire\n\n00:11:56.338 --> 00:11:57.605\nand lots of elephants:\n\n00:11:57.605 --> 00:12:01.281\nwide open savanna in blue, and just a few trees.\n\n00:12:01.281 --> 00:12:03.462\nAs we cross this fence line, now we're getting\n\n00:12:03.462 --> 00:12:05.786\ninto an area that has had protection from fire\n\n00:12:05.786 --> 00:12:07.643\nand zero elephants:\n\n00:12:07.643 --> 00:12:11.801\ndense vegetation, a radically different ecosystem.\n\n00:12:11.801 --> 00:12:14.191\nAnd in a place like Kruger,\n\n00:12:14.191 --> 00:12:15.932\nthe soaring elephant densities\n\n00:12:15.932 --> 00:12:17.675\nare a real problem.\n\n00:12:17.675 --> 00:12:20.039\nI know it's a sensitive issue for many of you,\n\n00:12:20.039 --> 00:12:22.699\nand there are no easy answers with this.\n\n00:12:22.699 --> 00:12:25.015\nBut what's good is that\nthe technology we've developed\n\n00:12:25.015 --> 00:12:27.487\nand we're working with in South Africa, for example,\n\n00:12:27.487 --> 00:12:30.843\nis allowing us to map every\nsingle tree in the savanna,\n\n00:12:30.843 --> 00:12:32.412\nand then through repeat flights\n\n00:12:32.412 --> 00:12:34.158\nwe're able to see which trees\n\n00:12:34.158 --> 00:12:36.188\nare being pushed over by elephants,\n\n00:12:36.188 --> 00:12:39.446\nin the red as you see on the screen,\nand how much that's happening\n\n00:12:39.446 --> 00:12:41.983\nin different types of landscapes in the savanna.\n\n00:12:41.983 --> 00:12:43.624\nThat's giving park managers\n\n00:12:43.624 --> 00:12:45.987\na very first opportunity to use\n\n00:12:45.987 --> 00:12:49.329\ntactical management strategies\nthat are more nuanced\n\n00:12:49.329 --> 00:12:53.151\nand don't lead to those extremes\nthat I just showed you.\n\n00:12:54.240 --> 00:12:56.863\nSo really, the way we're looking\n\n00:12:56.863 --> 00:12:58.904\nat protected areas nowadays\n\n00:12:58.904 --> 00:13:01.792\nis to think of it as tending to a circle of life,\n\n00:13:01.792 --> 00:13:03.840\nwhere we have fire management,\n\n00:13:03.840 --> 00:13:07.974\nelephant management, those impacts on\nthe structure of the ecosystem,\n\n00:13:07.974 --> 00:13:09.964\nand then those impacts\n\n00:13:09.964 --> 00:13:12.270\naffecting everything from insects\n\n00:13:12.270 --> 00:13:15.070\nup to apex predators like lions.\n\n00:13:15.070 --> 00:13:16.835\nGoing forward, I plan to greatly expand\n\n00:13:16.835 --> 00:13:18.563\nthe airborne observatory.\n\n00:13:18.563 --> 00:13:20.730\nI'm hoping to actually put the technology into orbit\n\n00:13:20.730 --> 00:13:22.413\nso we can manage the entire planet\n\n00:13:22.413 --> 00:13:24.146\nwith technologies like this.\n\n00:13:24.146 --> 00:13:25.995\nUntil then, you're going to find me flying\n\n00:13:25.995 --> 00:13:28.498\nin some remote place that you've never heard of.\n\n00:13:28.498 --> 00:13:31.040\nI just want to end by saying that technology is\n\n00:13:31.040 --> 00:13:34.779\nabsolutely critical to managing our planet,\n\n00:13:34.779 --> 00:13:36.878\nbut even more important is the understanding\n\n00:13:36.878 --> 00:13:38.610\nand wisdom to apply it.\n\n00:13:38.610 --> 00:13:40.709\nThank you.\n\n00:13:40.709 --> 00:13:44.786\n(Applause)"}, {"title": "Meet the robots for

Mr. Henry Evans.(Applause)Henry Evans: Hello. My name is Henry Evans, and until August 29, 2002, I was living my version of the American dream. I grew up in a typical American town near St. Louis. My dad was a lawyer. My mom was a homemaker. My six siblings and I were good kids, but caused our fair share of trouble. After high school, I left home to study and learn more about the world. I went to Notre Dame University and graduated with degrees in accounting and German, including spending a year of study in Austria. Later on, I earned an MBA at Stanford. I married my high school sweetheart, Jane. I am lucky to have her. Together, we raised four wonderful children. I worked and studied hard to move up the career ladder, eventually becoming a chief financial officer in Silicon Valley, a job I really enjoyed. My family and I bought our first and only home on December 13, 2001, a fixer-upper in a beautiful spot of Los Altos Hills, California, from where I am speaking to you now.We were looking forward to rebuilding it, but eight months after we moved in, I suffered a stroke-like attack caused by a birth defect. Overnight, I became a mute quadriplegic at the ripe old age of 40. It took me several years, but with the help of an incredibly supportive family, I finally decided life was still worth living. I became fascinated with using technology to help the severely disabled. Head tracking devices sold commercially by the company Madentec convert my tiny head movements into cursor movements, and enable my use of a regular computer. I can surf the web, exchange email with people, and routinely destroy my friend Steve Cousins in online word games. This technology allows me to remain engaged, mentally active, and feel like I am a part of the world.One day, I was lying in bed watching CNN, when I was amazed by Professor Charlie Kemp of the Healthcare Robotics Lab at Georgia Tech demonstrating a PR2 robot. I emailed Charlie and Steve Cousins of Willow Garage, and we formed the Robots for Humanity project. For about two years, Robots for Humanity developed ways for me to use the PR2 as my body surrogate. I shaved myself for the first time in 10 years. From my home in California, I shaved Charlie in Atlanta. (Laughter) I handed out Halloween candy. I opened my refrigerator on my own. I began doing tasks around the house. I saw new and previously unthinkable possibilities to live and contribute, both for myself and others in my circumstance.All of us have disabilities in one form or another. For example, if either of us wants to go 60 miles an hour, both of us will need an assistive device called a car. Your disability doesn't make you any less of a person, and neither does mine. By the way, check out my sweet ride. (Laughter) Since birth, we have both suffered from the inability to fly on our own.Last year, Kaijen Hsiao of Willow Garage connected with me Chad Jenkins. Chad showed me how easy it is to purchase and fly aerial drones. It was then I realized that I could also use an aerial drone to expand the worlds of bedridden people through flight, giving a sense of movement and control that is incredible. Using a mouse cursor I control with my head, these web interfaces allow me to see video from the robot and send control commands by pressing buttons in a web browser. With a little practice, I became good enough with this interface to drive around my home on my own. I could look around our garden and see the grapes we are growing. I inspected the solar panels on our roof. (Laughter) One of my challenges as a pilot is to land the drone on our basketball hoop. I went even further by seeing if I could use a head-mounted display, the Oculus Rift, as modified by Fighting Walrus, to have an immersive experience controlling the drone. With Chad's group at Brown, I regularly fly drones around his lab several times a week, from my home 3,000 miles away. All work and no fun makes for a dull quadriplegic, so we also find time to play friendly games of robot soccer. (Laughter) I never thought I would be able to casually move around a campus like Brown on my own. I just wish I could afford the tuition. (Laughter)Chad Jenkins: Henry, all joking aside, I bet all of these people here would love to see you fly this drone from your bed in California 3,000 miles away.(Applause)Okay, Henry, have you been to D.C. lately?(Laughter)Are you excited to be at TEDxMidAtlantic?(Laughter) (Applause)Can you show us how excited you are?(Laughter)All right, big finish. Can you show us how good of a pilot you are?(Applause)All right, we still have a little ways to go with that, but I think it shows the promise.What makes Henry's story amazing is it's about understanding Henry's needs, understanding what people in Henry's situation need from technology, and then also understanding what advanced technology can provide, and then bringing those two things together for use in a wise and responsible way. What we're trying to do is democratize robotics, so that anybody can be a part of this. We're providing affordable, off-the-shelf robot platforms such as the A.R. drone, 300 dollars, the Suitable Technologies beam, only 17,000 dollars, along with open-source robotics software so that you can be a part of what we're trying to do. And our hope is that, by providing these tools, that you'll be able to think of better ways to provide movement for the disabled, to provide care for our aging population, to help better educate our children, to think about what the new types of middle class jobs could be for the future, to both monitor and protect our environment, and to explore the universe.Back to you, Henry.HE: Thank you, Chad.With this drone setup, we show the potential for bedridden people to once again be able to explore the outside world, and robotics will eventually provide a level playing field where one is only limited by their mental acuity and imagination, where the disabled are able to perform the same activities as everyone else, and perhaps better, and technology will even allow us to provide an outlet for many people who are presently considered vegetables. One hundred years ago, I would have been treated like a vegetable. Actually, that's not true. I would have died.It is up to us, all of us, to decide how robotics will be used, for good or for evil, for simply replacing people or for making people better, for allowing us to do and enjoy more.Our goal for robotics is to unlock everyone's mental power by making the world more physically accessible to people such as myself and others like me around the globe. With the help of people like you, we can make this dream a reality.Thank you.(Applause)", "id": 1875, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:12.855 --> 00:00:15.251\nSarge Salman: All the way from\nLos Altos Hills, California,\n\n00:00:15.251 --> 00:00:17.312\nMr. Henry Evans.\n\n00:00:17.312 --> 00:00:21.204\n(Applause)\n\n00:00:32.435 --> 00:00:34.063\nHenry Evans: Hello.\n\n00:00:34.063 --> 00:00:35.918\nMy name is Henry Evans,\n\n00:00:35.918 --> 00:00:39.509\nand until August 29, 2002,\n\n00:00:39.509 --> 00:00:44.533\nI was living my version of the American dream.\n\n00:00:44.533 --> 00:00:49.031\nI grew up in a typical American town near St. Louis.\n\n00:00:49.031 --> 00:00:50.886\nMy dad was a lawyer.\n\n00:00:50.886 --> 00:00:53.875\nMy mom was a homemaker.\n\n00:00:53.875 --> 00:00:56.326\nMy six siblings and I were good kids,\n\n00:00:56.326 --> 00:00:59.818\nbut caused our fair share of trouble.\n\n00:00:59.818 --> 00:01:02.208\nAfter high school, I left home to study\n\n00:01:02.208 --> 00:01:05.111\nand learn more about the world.\n\n00:01:05.111 --> 00:01:07.768\nI went to Notre Dame University\n\n00:01:07.768 --> 00:01:11.314\nand graduated with degrees\nin accounting and German,\n\n00:01:11.314 --> 00:01:14.258\nincluding spending a year of study in Austria.\n\n00:01:14.258 --> 00:01:19.139\nLater on, I earned an MBA at Stanford.\n\n00:01:19.139 --> 00:01:23.151\nI married my high school sweetheart, Jane.\n\n00:01:23.151 --> 00:01:25.513\nI am lucky to have her.\n\n00:01:25.513 --> 00:01:30.158\nTogether, we raised four wonderful children.\n\n00:01:30.158 --> 00:01:33.239\nI worked and studied hard\nto move up the career ladder,\n\n00:01:33.239 --> 00:01:35.634\neventually becoming a chief financial officer\n\n00:01:35.634 --> 00:01:40.434\nin Silicon Valley, a job I really enjoyed.\n\n00:01:40.434 --> 00:01:43.211\nMy family and I bought our first and only home\n\n00:01:43.211 --> 00:01:47.047\non December 13, 2001,\n\n00:01:47.047 --> 00:01:49.256\na fixer-upper in a beautiful spot\n\n00:01:49.256 --> 00:01:51.696\nof Los Altos Hills, California,\n\n00:01:51.696 --> 00:01:54.932\nfrom where I am speaking to you now.\n\n00:01:54.932 --> 00:01:57.542\nWe were looking forward to rebuilding it,\n\n00:01:57.542 --> 00:01:59.777\nbut eight months after we moved in,\n\n00:01:59.777 --> 00:02:04.169\nI suffered a stroke-like attack\ncaused by a birth defect.\n\n00:02:04.169 --> 00:02:09.108\nOvernight, I became a mute quadriplegic\n\n00:02:09.108 --> 00:02:12.451\nat the ripe old age of 40.\n\n00:02:12.451 --> 00:02:14.604\nIt took me several years,\n\n00:02:14.604 --> 00:02:18.173\nbut with the help of an incredibly supportive family,\n\n00:02:18.173 --> 00:02:23.032\nI finally decided life was still worth living.\n\n00:02:23.032 --> 00:02:25.577\nI became fascinated with using technology\n\n00:02:25.577 --> 00:02:30.001\nto help the severely disabled.\n\n00:02:30.001 --> 00:02:32.523\nHead tracking devices sold commercially\n\n00:02:32.523 --> 00:02:35.274\nby the company Madentec\n\n00:02:35.274 --> 00:02:39.132\nconvert my tiny head movements\ninto cursor movements,\n\n00:02:39.132 --> 00:02:43.418\nand enable my use of a regular computer.\n\n00:02:43.418 --> 00:02:46.677\nI can surf the web, exchange email with people,\n\n00:02:46.677 --> 00:02:49.605\nand routinely destroy my friend Steve Cousins\n\n00:02:49.605 --> 00:02:51.722\nin online word games.\n\n00:02:51.722 --> 00:02:54.608\nThis technology allows me to remain engaged,\n\n00:02:54.608 --> 00:02:55.961\nmentally active,\n\n00:02:55.961 --> 00:02:59.712\nand feel like I am a part of the world.\n\n00:02:59.712 --> 00:03:03.017\nOne day, I was lying in bed watching CNN,\n\n00:03:03.017 --> 00:03:05.603\nwhen I was amazed by Professor Charlie Kemp\n\n00:03:05.603 --> 00:03:08.354\nof the Healthcare Robotics Lab at Georgia Tech\n\n00:03:08.354 --> 00:03:11.198\ndemonstrating a PR2 robot.\n\n00:03:11.198 --> 00:03:15.245\nI emailed Charlie and\nSteve Cousins of Willow Garage,\n\n00:03:15.245 --> 00:03:20.097\nand we formed the Robots for Humanity project.\n\n00:03:20.097 --> 00:03:22.998\nFor about two years, Robots for Humanity\n\n00:03:22.998 --> 00:03:25.379\ndeveloped ways for me to use the PR2\n\n00:03:25.379 --> 00:03:28.759\nas my body surrogate.\n\n00:03:28.759 --> 00:03:33.852\nI shaved myself for the first time in 10 years.\n\n00:03:33.852 --> 00:03:35.626\nFrom my home in California,\n\n00:03:35.626 --> 00:03:39.605\nI shaved Charlie in Atlanta.

One billion people. One seventh of the Earth's population are totally cut off for some part of the year. We cannot get medicine to them reliably, they cannot get critical supplies, and they cannot get their goods to market in order to create a sustainable income. In sub-Saharan Africa, for instance, 85 percent of roads are unusable in the wet season. Investments are being made, but at the current level, it's estimated it's going to take them 50 years to catch up. In the U.S. alone, there's more than four million miles of roads, very expensive to build, very expensive to maintain infrastructure, with a huge ecological footprint, and yet, very often, congested.So we saw this and we thought, can there be a better way? Can we create a system using today's most advanced technologies that can allow this part of the world to leapfrog in the same way they've done with mobile telephones in the last 10 years? Many of those nations have excellent telecommunications today without ever putting copper lines in the ground. Could we do the same for transportation?Imagine this scenario. Imagine you are in a maternity ward in Mali, and have a newborn in need of urgent medication. What would you do today? Well, you would place a request via mobile phone, and someone would get the request immediately. That's the part that works. The medication may take days to arrive, though, because of bad roads. That's the part that's broken.We believe we can deliver it within hours with an electric autonomous flying vehicle such as this. This can transport a small payload today, about two kilograms, over a short distance, about 10 kilometers, but it's part of a wider network that may cover the entire country, maybe even the entire continent. It's an ultra-flexible, automated logistics network. It's a network for a transportation of matter. We call it Matternet.We use three key technologies. The first is electric autonomous flying vehicles. The second is automated ground stations that the vehicles fly in and out of to swap batteries and fly farther, or pick up or deliver loads. And the third is the operating system that manages the whole network.Let's look at each one of those technologies in a bit more detail. First of all, the UAVs. Eventually, we're going to be using all sorts of vehicles for different payload capacities and different ranges. Today, we're using small quads. These are able to transport two kilograms over 10 kilometers in just about 15 minutes. Compare this with trying to trespass a bad road in the developing world, or even being stuck in traffic in a developed world country. These fly autonomously. This is the key to the technology. So they use GPS and other sensors on board to navigate between ground stations. Every vehicle is equipped with an automatic payload and battery exchange mechanism, so these vehicles navigate to those ground stations, they dock, swap a battery automatically, and go out again. The ground stations are located on safe locations on the ground. They secure the most vulnerable part of the mission, which is the landing. They are at known locations on the ground, so the paths between them are also known, which is very important from a reliability perspective from the whole network. Apart from fulfilling the energy requirements of the vehicles, eventually they're going to be becoming commercial hubs where people can take out loads or put loads into the network. The last component is the operating system that manages the whole network. It monitors weather data from all the ground stations and optimizes the routes of the vehicles through the system to avoid adverse weather conditions, avoid other risk factors, and optimize the use of the resources throughout the network.I want to show you what one of those flights looks like. Here we are flying in Haiti last summer, where we've done our first field trials. We're modeling here a medical delivery in a camp we set up after the 2010 earthquake. People there love this.And I want to show you what one of those vehicles looks like up close. So this is a $3,000 vehicle. Costs are coming down very rapidly. We use this in all sorts of weather conditions, very hot and very cold climates, very strong winds. They're very sturdy vehicles. Imagine if your life depended on this package, somewhere in Africa or in New York City, after Sandy. The next big question is, what's the cost?Well, it turns out that the cost to transport two kilograms over 10 kilometers with this vehicle is just 24 cents.(Applause)And it's counterintuitive, but the cost of energy expended for the flight is only two cents of a dollar today, and we're just at the beginning of this. When we saw this, we felt that this is something that can have significant impact in the world.So we said, okay, how much does it cost to set up a network somewhere in the world? And we looked at setting up a network in Lesotho for transportation of HIV/AIDS samples. The problem there is how do you take them from clinics where they're being collected to hospitals where they're being analyzed? And we said, what if we wanted to cover an area spanning around 140 square kilometers? That's roughly one and a half times the size of Manhattan. Well it turns out that the cost to do that there would be less than a million dollars. Compare this to normal infrastructure investments. We think this can be \u2014 this is the power of a new paradigm.So here we are: a new idea about a network for transportation that is based on the ideas of the Internet. It's decentralized, it's peer-to-peer, it's bidirectional, highly adaptable, with very low infrastructure investment, very low ecological footprint. If it is a new paradigm, though, there must be other uses for it. It can be used perhaps in other places in the world.So let's look at the other end of the spectrum: our cities and megacities. Half of the Earth's population lives in cities today. Half a billion of us live in megacities. We are living through an amazing urbanization trend. China alone is adding a megacity the size of New York City every two years. These are places that do have road infrastructure, but it's very inefficient. Congestion is a huge problem. So we think it makes sense in those places to set up a network of transportation that is a new layer that sits between the road and the Internet, initially for lightweight, urgent stuff, and over time, we would hope to develop this into a new mode of transportation that is truly a modern solution to a very old problem. It's ultimately scalable with a very small ecological footprint, operating in the background 24/7, just like the Internet.So when we started this a couple of years ago now, we've had a lot of people come up to us who said, \"This is a very interesting but crazy idea, and certainly not something that you should engage with anytime soon.\" And of course, we're talking about drones, right, a technology that's not only unpopular in the West but one that has become a very, very unpleasant fact of life for many living in poor countries, especially those engaged in conflict.So why are we doing this? Well, we chose to do this one not because it's easy, but because it can have amazing impact. Imagine one billion people being connected to physical goods in the same way that mobile telecommunications connected them to information. Imagine if the next big network we built in the world was a network for the transportation of matter. In the developing world, we would hope to reach millions of people with better vaccines, reach them with better medication. It would give us an unfair advantage against battling HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis and other epidemics. Over time, we would hope it would become a new platform for economic transactions, lifting millions of people out of poverty. In the developed world and the emerging world, we would hope it would become a new mode of transportation that could help make our cities more livable.So for those that still believe that this is science fiction, I firmly say to you that it is not. We do need to engage, though, in social fiction to make it happen.Thank you.(Applause)", "id": 1876, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:13.004 -->

00:07:03.198\nThese are places that do have road infrastructure,\n\n00:07:03.198 --> 00:07:05.512\nbut it's very inefficient.\n\n00:07:05.512 --> 00:07:07.644\nCongestion is a huge problem.\n\n00:07:07.644 --> 00:07:09.584\nSo we think it makes sense in those places\n\n00:07:09.584 --> 00:07:11.954\nto set up a network of transportation\n\n00:07:11.954 --> 00:07:14.120\nthat is a new layer that sits between the road\n\n00:07:14.120 --> 00:07:15.391\nand the Internet,\n\n00:07:15.391 --> 00:07:18.297\ninitially for lightweight, urgent stuff,\n\n00:07:18.297 --> 00:07:20.346\nand over time, we would hope to develop this\n\n00:07:20.346 --> 00:07:22.338\ninto a new mode of transportation\n\n00:07:22.338 --> 00:07:25.790\nthat is truly a modern solution to a very old problem.\n\n00:07:25.790 --> 00:07:27.344\nIt's ultimately scalable\n\n00:07:27.344 --> 00:07:30.202\nwith a very small ecological footprint,\n\n00:07:30.202 --> 00:07:33.178\noperating in the background 24/7,\n\n00:07:33.178 --> 00:07:35.524\njust like the Internet.\n\n00:07:35.524 --> 00:07:37.946\nSo when we started this\n\n00:07:37.946 --> 00:07:40.948\na couple of years ago now,\n\n00:07:40.948 --> 00:07:43.292\nwe've had a lot of people come up to us who said,\n\n00:07:43.292 --> 00:07:46.124\n\"This is a very interesting but crazy idea,\n\n00:07:46.124 --> 00:07:47.958\nand certainly not something that you should\n\n00:07:47.958 --> 00:07:50.672\nengage with anytime soon.\"\n\n00:07:50.672 --> 00:07:52.815\nAnd of course, we're talking about drones, right,\n\n00:07:52.815 --> 00:07:56.517\na technology that's not only unpopular in the West\n\n00:07:56.517 --> 00:07:58.465\nbut one that has become a very, very unpleasant\n\n00:07:58.465 --> 00:08:01.330\nfact of life for many living in poor countries,\n\n00:08:01.330 --> 00:08:04.141\nespecially those engaged in conflict.\n\n00:08:04.141 --> 00:08:08.675\nSo why are we doing this?\n\n00:08:08.675 --> 00:08:11.459\nWell, we chose to do this one\n\n00:08:11.459 --> 00:08:13.245\nnot because it's easy,\n\n00:08:13.245 --> 00:08:16.080\nbut because it can have amazing impact.\n\n00:08:16.080 --> 00:08:18.905\nImagine one billion people being connected\n\n00:08:18.905 --> 00:08:21.300\nto physical goods in the same way\n\n00:08:21.300 --> 00:08:24.324\nthat mobile telecommunications connected them\n\n00:08:24.324 --> 00:08:26.416\nto information.\n\n00:08:26.416 --> 00:08:30.156\nImagine if the next big network we built in the world\n\n00:08:30.156 --> 00:08:33.919\nwas a network for the transportation of matter.\n\n00:08:33.919 --> 00:08:36.321\nIn the developing world, we would hope\n\n00:08:36.321 --> 00:08:39.026\nto reach millions of people with better vaccines,\n\n00:08:39.026 --> 00:08:40.910\nreach them with better medication.\n\n00:08:40.910 --> 00:08:42.768\nIt would give us an unfair advantage against battling\n\n00:08:42.768 --> 00:08:46.760\nHIV/AIDS, tuberculosis and other epidemics.\n\n00:08:46.760 --> 00:08:48.456\nOver time, we would hope it would become\n\n00:08:48.456 --> 00:08:50.630\na new platform for economic transactions,\n\n00:08:50.630 --> 00:08:53.091\nlifting millions of people out of poverty.\n\n00:08:53.091 --> 00:08:55.301\nIn the developed world and the emerging world,\n\n00:08:55.301 --> 00:08:56.769\nwe would hope it would become a new mode\n\n00:08:56.769 --> 00:09:00.490\nof transportation that could help make our cities\n\n00:09:00.490 --> 00:09:02.343\nmore livable.\n\n00:09:02.343 --> 00:09:05.686\nSo for those that still believe\nthat this is science fiction,\n\n00:09:05.686 --> 00:09:08.501\nI firmly say to you that it is not.\n\n00:09:08.501 --> 00:09:10.170\nWe do need to engage, though,\n\n00:09:10.170 --> 00:09:13.238\nin social fiction to make it happen.\n\n00:09:13.238 --> 00:09:15.405\nThank you.\n\n00:09:15.405 -->

"https://www.ted.com/talks/peter_doolittle_how_your_working_memory_makes_sense_of_the_world", "transcript": "So yesterday, I was out in the street in front of this building, and I was walking down the sidewalk, and I had company, several of us, and we were all abiding by the rules of walking down sidewalks. We're not talking each other. We're facing forward. We're moving. When the person in front of me slows down. And so I'm watching him, and he slows down, and finally he stops. Well, that wasn't fast enough for me, so I put on my turn signal, and I walked around him, and as I walked, I looked to see what he was doing, and he was doing this. He was texting, and he couldn't text and walk at the same time. Now we could approach this from a working memory perspective or from a multitasking perspective. We're going to do working memory today.Now, working memory is that part of our consciousness that we are aware of at any given time of day. You're going it right now. It's not something we can turn off. If you turn it off, that's called a coma, okay? So right now, you're doing just fine.Now working memory has four basic components. It allows us to store some immediate experiences and a little bit of knowledge. It allows us to reach back into our long-term memory and pull some of that in as we need it, mixes it, processes it in light of whatever our current goal is. Now the current goal isn't something like, I want to be president or the best surfer in the world. It's more mundane. I'd like that cookie, or I need to figure out how to get into my hotel room. Now working memory capacity is our ability to leverage that, our ability to take what we know and what we can hang onto and leverage it in ways that allow us to satisfy our current goal.Now working memory capacity has a fairly long history, and it's associated with a lot of positive effects. People with high working memory capacity tend to be good storytellers. They tend to solve and do well on standardized tests, however important that is. They're able to have high levels of writing ability. They're also able to reason at high levels.So what we're going to do here is play a little bit with some of that. So I'm going to ask you to perform a couple tasks, and we're going to take your  working memory out for a ride. You up for that? Okay.I'm going to give you five words, and I just want you to hang on to them. Don't write them down. Just hang on to them. Five words. While you're hanging on to them, I'm going to ask you to answer three questions. I want to see what happens with those words. So here's the words: tree, highway, mirror, Saturn and electrode. So far so good? Okay. What I want you to do is I want you to tell me what the answer is to 23 times eight. Just shout it out. (Mumbling) (Laughter) In fact it's \u2014 (Mumbling) \u2014 exactly. (Laughter) All right. I want you to take out your left hand and I want you to go, \"One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10.\" It's a neurological test, just in case you were wondering. All right, now what I want you to do is to recite the last five letters of the English alphabet backwards. You should have started with Z. (Laughter)All right. How many people here are still pretty sure you've got all five words? Okay. Typically we end up with about less than half, right, which is normal. There will be a range. Some people can hang on to five. Some people can hang on to 10. Some will be down to two or three.What we know is this is really important to the way we function, right? And it's going to be really important here at TED because you're going to be exposed to so many different ideas.Now the problem that we have is that life comes at us, and it comes at us very quickly, and what we need to do is to take that amorphous flow of experience and somehow extract meaning from it with a working memory that's about the size of a pea. Now don't get me wrong, working memory is awesome. Working memory allows us to investigate our current experience as we move forward. It allows us to make sense of the world around us. But it does have certain limits.Now working memory is great for allowing us to communicate. We can have a conversation, and I can build a narrative around that so I know where we've been and where we're going and how to contribute to this conversation. It allows us to problem-solve, critical think. We can be in the middle of a meeting, listen to somebody's presentation, evaluate it, decide whether or not we like it, ask follow-up questions. All of that occurs within working memory. It also allows us to go to the store and allows us to get milk and eggs and cheese when what we're really looking for is Red Bull and bacon. (Laughter) Gotta make sure we're getting what we're looking for. Now, a central issue with working memory is that it's limited. It's limited in capacity, limited in duration, limited in focus. We tend to remember about four things. Okay? It used to be seven, but with functional MRIs, apparently it's four, and we were overachieving. Now we can remember those four things for about 10 to 20 seconds unless we do something with it, unless we process it, unless we apply it to something, unless we talk to somebody about it.When we think about working memory, we have to realize that this limited capacity has lots of different impacts on us. Have you ever walked from one room to another and then forgotten why you're there? You do know the solution to that, right? You go back to that original room. (Laughter) Have you ever forgotten your keys? You ever forgotten your car? You ever forgotten your kids? Have you ever been involved in a conversation, and you realize that the conversation to your left is actually more interesting? (Laughter) So you're nodding and you're smiling, but you're really paying attention to this one over here, until you hear that last word go up, and you realize, you've been asked a question. (Laughter) And you're really hoping the answer is no, because that's what you're about to say. All of that talks about working memory, what we can do and what we can't do. We need to realize that working memory has a limited capacity, and that working memory capacity itself is how we negotiate that. We negotiate that through strategies.So what I want to do is talk a little bit about a couple of strategies here, and these will be really important because you are now in an information target-rich environment for the next several days. Now the first part of this that we need to think about and we need to process our existence, our life, immediately and repeatedly. We need to process what's going on the moment it happens, not 10 minutes later, not a week later, at the moment. So we need to think about, well, do I agree with him? What's missing? What would I like to know? Do I agree with the assumptions? How can I apply this in my life? It's a way of processing what's going on so that we can use it later. Now we also need to repeat it. We need to practice. So we need to think about it here. In between, we want to talk to people about it. We're going to write it down, and when you get home, pull out those notes and think about them and end up practicing over time. Practice for some reason became a very negative thing. It's very positive.The next thing is, we need to think elaboratively and we need to think illustratively. Oftentimes, we think that we have to relate new knowledge to prior knowledge. What we want to do is spin that around. We want to take all of our existence and wrap it around that new knowledge and make all of these connections and it becomes more meaningful. We also want to use imagery. We are built for images. We need to take advantage of that. Think about things in images, write things down that way. If you read a book, pull things up. I just got through reading \"The Great Gatsby,\" and I have a perfect idea of what he looks like in my head, so my own version.The last one is organization and support. We are meaning-making machines. It's what we do. We try to make meaning out of everything that happens to us. Organization helps, so we need to structure what we're doing in ways that make sense. If we are providing knowledge and experience, we need to structure that.And the last one is support. We all started as novices. Everything we do is an approximation of sophistication. We should expect it to change over time. We have to support that. The support may come in asking people questions, giving them a sheet of paper that has an organizational chart on it or has some guiding images, but we need to support it.Now, the final piece of this, the take-home message from a working memory capacity standpoint is this: what we process, we learn. If we're not processing life, we're not living it. Live life.

Typically we end up with about less than half,\n\n00:03:51.507 --> 00:03:53.582\nright, which is normal. There will be a range.\n\n00:03:53.582 --> 00:03:55.138\nSome people can hang on to five.\n\n00:03:55.138 --> 00:03:56.422\nSome people can hang on to 10.\n\n00:03:56.422 --> 00:03:58.727\nSome will be down to two or three.\n\n00:03:58.727 --> 00:04:02.131\nWhat we know is this is really important\nto the way we function, right?\n\n00:04:02.131 --> 00:04:04.079\nAnd it's going to be really important here at TED\n\n00:04:04.079 --> 00:04:07.115\nbecause you're going to be exposed\nto so many different ideas.\n\n00:04:07.115 --> 00:04:09.322\nNow the problem that we have\n\n00:04:09.322 --> 00:04:11.034\nis that life comes at us,\n\n00:04:11.034 --> 00:04:13.151\nand it comes at us very quickly,\n\n00:04:13.151 --> 00:04:17.064\nand what we need to do is to take that amorphous\n\n00:04:17.064 --> 00:04:18.842\nflow of experience and somehow\n\n00:04:18.842 --> 00:04:20.349\nextract meaning from it\n\n00:04:20.349 --> 00:04:21.648\nwith a working memory\n\n00:04:21.648 --> 00:04:23.917\nthat's about the size of a pea.\n\n00:04:23.917 --> 00:04:26.464\nNow don't get me wrong,\nworking memory is awesome.\n\n00:04:26.464 --> 00:04:28.579\nWorking memory allows us\n\n00:04:28.579 --> 00:04:30.951\nto investigate our current experience\n\n00:04:30.951 --> 00:04:32.446\nas we move forward.\n\n00:04:32.446 --> 00:04:35.614\nIt allows us to make sense of the world around us.\n\n00:04:35.614 --> 00:04:37.533\nBut it does have certain limits.\n\n00:04:37.533 --> 00:04:41.376\nNow working memory is great\nfor allowing us to communicate.\n\n00:04:41.376 --> 00:04:42.848\nWe can have a conversation,\n\n00:04:42.848 --> 00:04:45.535\nand I can build a narrative around that\n\n00:04:45.535 --> 00:04:47.265\nso I know where we've been and where we're going\n\n00:04:47.265 --> 00:04:49.353\nand how to contribute to this conversation.\n\n00:04:49.353 --> 00:04:51.590\nIt allows us to problem-solve, critical think.\n\n00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:53.394\nWe can be in the middle of a meeting,\n\n00:04:53.394 --> 00:04:55.897\nlisten to somebody's presentation, evaluate it,\n\n00:04:55.897 --> 00:04:57.539\ndecide whether or not we like it,\n\n00:04:57.539 --> 00:04:58.797\nask follow-up questions.\n\n00:04:58.797 --> 00:05:02.167\nAll of that occurs within working memory.\n\n00:05:02.167 --> 00:05:04.014\nIt also allows us to go to the store\n\n00:05:04.014 --> 00:05:07.668\nand allows us to get milk and eggs and cheese\n\n00:05:07.668 --> 00:05:09.439\nwhen what we're really looking for\n\n00:05:09.439 --> 00:05:12.276\nis Red Bull and bacon.

We need to practice.\n\n00:07:31.639 --> 00:07:34.051\nSo we need to think about it here.\n\n00:07:34.051 --> 00:07:36.846\nIn between, we want to talk to people about it.\n\n00:07:36.846 --> 00:07:39.069\nWe're going to write it down,\nand when you get home,\n\n00:07:39.069 --> 00:07:41.029\npull out those notes and think about them\n\n00:07:41.029 --> 00:07:43.418\nand end up practicing over time.\n\n00:07:43.418 --> 00:07:45.969\nPractice for some reason\nbecame a very negative thing.\n\n00:07:45.969 --> 00:07:47.421\nIt's very positive.\n\n00:07:47.421 --> 00:07:50.471\nThe next thing is, we need to think elaboratively\n\n00:07:50.471 --> 00:07:52.811\nand we need to think illustratively.\n\n00:07:52.811 --> 00:07:56.265\nOftentimes, we think that we have to relate\nnew knowledge to prior knowledge.\n\n00:07:56.265 --> 00:07:58.195\nWhat we want to do is spin that around.\n\n00:07:58.195 --> 00:07:59.952\nWe want to take all of our existence\n\n00:07:59.952 --> 00:08:01.705\nand wrap it around that new knowledge\n\n00:08:01.705 --> 00:08:05.153\nand make all of these connections\nand it becomes more meaningful.\n\n00:08:05.153 --> 00:08:08.947\nWe also want to use imagery.\nWe are built for images.\n\n00:08:08.947 --> 00:08:10.805\nWe need to take advantage of that.\n\n00:08:10.805 --> 00:08:12.315\nThink about things in images,\n\n00:08:12.315 --> 00:08:14.664\nwrite things down that way.\n\n00:08:14.664 --> 00:08:16.226\nIf you read a book, pull things up.\n\n00:08:16.226 --> 00:08:18.279\nI just got through reading \"The Great Gatsby,\"\n\n00:08:18.279 --> 00:08:21.378\nand I have a perfect idea of what he looks like\n\n00:08:21.378 --> 00:08:24.376\nin my head, so my own version.\n\n00:08:24.376 --> 00:08:26.379\nThe last one is organization and support.\n\n00:08:26.379 --> 00:08:28.948\nWe are meaning-making machines.

(Laughter)Okay. You are the people to whom my talk will be of practical value. (Laughter) The rest of you won't find my talk personally relevant, but I think that you will still find the subject fascinating.I'm going to talk about growing older in traditional societies. This subject constitutes just one chapter of my latest book, which compares traditional, small, tribal societies with our large, modern societies, with respect to many topics such as bringing up children, growing older, health, dealing with danger, settling disputes, religion and speaking more than one language.Those tribal societies, which constituted all human societies for most of human history, are far more diverse than are our modern, recent, big societies. All big societies that have governments, and where most people are strangers to each other, are inevitably similar to each other and different from tribal societies. Tribes constitute thousands of natural experiments in how to run a human society. They constitute experiments from which we ourselves may be able to learn. Tribal societies shouldn't be scorned as primitive and miserable, but also they shouldn't be romanticized as happy and peaceful. When we learn of tribal practices, some of them will horrify us, but there are other tribal practices which, when we hear about them, we may admire and envy and wonder whether we could adopt those practices ourselves.Most old people in the U.S. end up living separately from their children and from most of their friends of their earlier years, and often they live in separate retirements homes for the elderly, whereas in traditional societies, older people instead live out their lives among their children, their other relatives, and their lifelong friends. Nevertheless, the treatment of the elderly varies enormously among traditional societies, from much worse to much better than in our modern societies.At the worst extreme, many traditional societies get rid of their elderly in one of four increasingly direct ways: by neglecting their elderly and not feeding or cleaning them until they die, or by abandoning them when the group moves, or by encouraging older people to commit suicide, or by killing older people. In which tribal societies do children abandon or kill their parents? It happens mainly under two conditions. One is in nomadic, hunter-gather societies that often shift camp and that are physically incapable of transporting old people who can't walk when the able-bodied younger people already have to carry their young children and all their physical possessions. The other condition is in societies living in marginal or fluctuating environments, such as the Arctic or deserts, where there are periodic food shortages, and occasionally there just isn't enough food to keep everyone alive. Whatever food is available has to be reserved for able-bodied adults and for children. To us Americans, it sounds horrible to think of abandoning or killing your own sick wife or husband or elderly mother or father, but what could those traditional societies do differently? They face a cruel situation of no choice. Their old people had to do it to their own parents, and the old people know what now is going to happen to them.At the opposite extreme in treatment of the elderly, the happy extreme, are the New Guinea farming societies where I've been doing my fieldwork  for the past 50 years, and most other sedentary traditional societies around the world. In those societies, older people are cared for. They are fed. They remain valuable. And they continue to live in the same hut or else in a nearby hut near their children, relatives and lifelong friends.There are two main sets of reasons for this variation among societies in their treatment of old people. The variation depends especially on the usefulness of old people and on the society's values.First, as regards usefulness, older people continue to perform useful services. One use of older people in traditional societies is that they often are still effective at producing food. Another traditional usefulness of older people is that they are capable of babysitting their grandchildren, thereby freeing up their own adult children, the parents of those grandchildren, to go hunting and gathering food for the grandchildren. Still another traditional value of older people is in making tools, weapons, baskets, pots and textiles. In fact, they're usually the people who are best at it. Older people usually are the leaders of traditional societies, and the people most knowledgeable about politics, medicine, religion, songs and dances.Finally, older people in traditional societies have a huge significance that would never occur to us in our modern, literate societies, where our sources of information are books and the Internet. In contrast, in traditional societies without writing, older people are the repositories of information. It's their knowledge that spells the difference between survival and death for their whole society in a time of crisis caused by rare events for which only the oldest people alive have had experience. Those, then, are the ways in which older people are useful in traditional societies. Their usefulness varies and contributes to variation in the society's treatment of the elderly.The other set of reasons for variation in the treatment of the elderly is the society's cultural values. For example, there's particular emphasis on respect for the elderly in East Asia, associated with Confucius' doctrine of filial piety, which means obedience, respect and support for elderly parents. Cultural values that emphasize respect for older people contrast with the low status of the elderly in the U.S. Older Americans are at a big disadvantage in job applications. They're at a big disadvantage in hospitals. Our hospitals have an explicit policy called age-based allocation of healthcare resources. That sinister expression means that if hospital resources are limited, for example if only one donor heart becomes available for transplant, or if a surgeon has time to operate on only a certain number of patients, American hospitals have an explicit policy of giving preference to younger patients over older patients on the grounds that younger patients are considered more valuable to society because they have more years of life ahead of them, even though the younger patients have fewer years of valuable life experience behind them. There are several reasons for this low status of the elderly in the U.S. One is our Protestant work ethic which places high value on work, so older people who are no longer working aren't respected. Another reason is our American emphasis on the virtues of self-reliance and independence, so we instinctively look down on older people who are no longer self-reliant and independent. Still a third reason is our American cult of youth, which shows up even in our advertisements. Ads for Coca-Cola and beer always depict smiling young people, even though old as well as young people buy and drink Coca-Cola and beer. Just think, what's the last time you saw a Coke or beer ad depicting smiling people 85 years old? Never. Instead, the only American ads featuring white-haired old people are ads for retirement homes and pension planning.Well, what has changed in the status of the elderly today compared to their status in traditional societies? There have been a few changes for the better and more changes for the worse. Big changes for the better include the fact that today we enjoy much longer lives, much better health in our old age, and much better recreational opportunities. Another change for the better is that we now have specialized retirement facilities and programs to take care of old people. Changes for the worse begin with the cruel reality that we now have more old people and fewer young people than at any time in the past. That means that all those old people are more of a burden on the few young people, and that each old person has less individual value. Another big change for the worse in the status of the elderly is the breaking of social ties with age, because older people, their children, and their friends, all move and scatter independently of each other many times during their lives. We Americans move on the average every five years. Hence our older people are likely to end up living distant from their children and the friends of their youth. Yet another change for the worse in the status of the elderly is formal retirement from the workforce, carrying with it a loss of work friendships and a loss of the self-esteem associated with work. Perhaps the biggest change for the worse is that our elderly are objectively less useful than in traditional societies. Widespread literacy means that they are no longer useful as repositories of knowledge. When we want some information, we look it up in a book or we Google it instead of finding some old person to ask. The slow pace of technological change in traditional societies means that what someone learns there as a child is still useful when that person is old, but the rapid pace of technological change today means that what we learn as children is no longer useful 60 years later. And conversely, we older people are not fluent in the technologies essential for surviving in modern society. For example, as a 15-year-old, I was considered outstandingly good at multiplying numbers because I had memorized the multiplication tables and I know how to use logarithms and I'm quick at manipulating a slide rule. Today, though, those skills are utterly useless because any idiot can now multiply eight-digit numbers accurately and instantly with a pocket calculator. Conversely, I at age 75 am incompetent at skills essential for everyday life. My family's first TV set in 1948 had only three knobs that I quickly mastered: an on-off switch, a volume knob, and a channel selector knob. Today, just to watch a program on the TV set in my own house, I have to operate a 41-button TV remote that utterly defeats me. I have to telephone my 25-year-old sons and ask them to talk me through it while I try to push those wretched 41 buttons.What can we do to improve the lives of the elderly in the U.S., and to make better use of their value? That's a huge problem. In my remaining four minutes today, I can offer just a few suggestions. One value of older people is that they are increasingly useful as grandparents for offering high-quality childcare to their grandchildren, if they choose to do it, as more young women enter the workforce and as fewer young parents of either gender stay home as full-time caretakers of their children. Compared to the usual alternatives of paid babysitters and day care centers, grandparents offer superior, motivated, experienced child care. They've already gained experience from raising their own children. They usually love their grandchildren, and are eager to spend time with them. Unlike other caregivers, grandparents don't quit their job because they found another job with higher pay looking after another baby. A second value of older people is paradoxically related to their loss of value as a result of changing world conditions and technology. At the same time, older people have gained in value today precisely because of their unique experience of living conditions that have now become rare because of rapid change, but that could come back. For example, only Americans now in their 70s or older today can remember the experience of living through a great depression, the experience of living through a world war, and agonizing whether or not dropping atomic bombs would be more horrible than the likely consequences of not dropping atomic bombs. Most of our current voters and politicians have no personal experience of any of those things, but millions of older Americans do. Unfortunately, all of those terrible situations could come back. Even if they don't come back, we have to be able to plan for them on the basis of the experience of what they were like. Older people have that experience. Younger people don't.The remaining value of older people that I'll mention involves recognizing that while there are many things that older people can no longer do, there are other things that they can do better than younger people. A challenge for society is  to make use of those things that older people are better at doing. Some abilities, of course, decrease with age. Those include abilities at tasks requiring physical strength and stamina, ambition, and the power of novel reasoning in a circumscribed situation, such as figuring out the structure of DNA, best left to scientists under the age of 30. Conversely, valuable attributes that increase with age include experience, understanding of people and human relationships, ability to help other people without your own ego getting in the way, and interdisciplinary thinking about large databases, such as economics and comparative history, best left to scholars over the age of 60. Hence older people are much better than younger people at supervising, administering, advising, strategizing, teaching, synthesizing, and devising long-term plans. I've seen this value of older people with so many of my friends in their 60s, 70s, 80s and 90s, who are still active as investment managers, farmers, lawyers and doctors. In short, many traditional societies make better use of their elderly and give their elderly more satisfying lives than we do in modern, big societies.Paradoxically nowadays, when we have more elderly people than ever before, living healthier lives and with better medical care than ever before, old age is in some respects more miserable than ever before. The lives of the elderly are widely recognized as constituting a disaster area of modern American society. We can surely do better by learning from the lives of the elderly in traditional societies. But what's true of the lives of the elderly in traditional societies is true of many other features of traditional societies as well. Of course, I'm not advocating that we all give up agriculture and metal tools and return to a hunter-gatherer lifestyle. There are many obvious respects in which our lives today are far happier than those in small, traditional societies. To mention just a few examples, our lives are longer, materially much richer, and less plagued by violence than are the lives of people in traditional societies. But there are also things to be admired about people in traditional societies, and perhaps to be learned from them. Their lives are usually socially much richer than our lives, although materially poorer. Their children are more self-confident, more independent, and more socially skilled than are our children. They think more realistically about dangers than we do. They almost never die of diabetes, heart disease, stroke, and the other noncommunicable diseases that will be the causes of death of almost all of us in this room today. Features of the modern lifestyle predispose us to those diseases, and features of the traditional lifestyle protect us against them.Those are just some examples of what we can learn from traditional societies. I hope that you will find it as fascinating to read about traditional societies as I found it to live in those societies.Thank you.(Applause)", "id": 1877, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:12.703 --> 00:00:14.932\nTo give me an idea of how many of you here\n\n00:00:14.932 --> 00:00:17.054\nmay find what I'm about to tell you\n\n00:00:17.054 --> 00:00:18.679\nof practical value,\n\n00:00:18.679 --> 00:00:21.368\nlet me ask you please to raise your hands:\n\n00:00:21.368 --> 00:00:24.935\nWho here is either over 65 years old\n\n00:00:24.935 --> 00:00:28.704\nor hopes to live past age 65\n\n00:00:28.704 --> 00:00:31.649\nor has parents or grandparents who did live\n\n00:00:31.649 --> 00:00:33.616\nor have lived past 65,\n\n00:00:33.616 --> 00:00:36.201\nraise your hands please.

00:01:00.400\ntraditional, small, tribal societies\n\n00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:02.950\nwith our large, modern societies,\n\n00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:04.575\nwith respect to many topics\n\n00:01:04.575 --> 00:01:06.434\nsuch as bringing up children,\n\n00:01:06.434 --> 00:01:10.355\ngrowing older, health, dealing with danger,\n\n00:01:10.355 --> 00:01:12.700\nsettling disputes, religion\n\n00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:15.491\nand speaking more than one language.\n\n00:01:15.491 --> 00:01:18.048\nThose tribal societies, which constituted\n\n00:01:18.048 --> 00:01:21.033\nall human societies for most of human history,\n\n00:01:21.033 --> 00:01:24.327\nare far more diverse than are our modern,\n\n00:01:24.327 --> 00:01:26.494\nrecent, big societies.\n\n00:01:26.494 --> 00:01:28.857\nAll big societies that have governments,\n\n00:01:28.857 --> 00:01:31.123\nand where most people are strangers to each other,\n\n00:01:31.123 --> 00:01:33.471\nare inevitably similar to each other\n\n00:01:33.471 --> 00:01:36.319\nand different from tribal societies.\n\n00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:39.630\nTribes constitute thousands of natural experiments\n\n00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:42.179\nin how to run a human society.\n\n00:01:42.179 --> 00:01:44.986\nThey constitute experiments from which we ourselves\n\n00:01:44.986 --> 00:01:47.388\nmay be able to learn.\n\n00:01:47.388 --> 00:01:49.408\nTribal societies shouldn't be scorned\n\n00:01:49.408 --> 00:01:51.144\nas primitive and miserable,\n\n00:01:51.144 --> 00:01:53.515\nbut also they shouldn't be romanticized\n\n00:01:53.515 --> 00:01:55.732\nas happy and peaceful.\n\n00:01:55.732 --> 00:01:57.991\nWhen we learn of tribal practices,\n\n00:01:57.991 --> 00:01:59.765\nsome of them will horrify us,\n\n00:01:59.765 --> 00:02:02.315\nbut there are other tribal practices which,\n\n00:02:02.315 --> 00:02:03.664\nwhen we hear about them,\n\n00:02:03.664 --> 00:02:05.611\nwe may admire and envy\n\n00:02:05.611 --> 00:02:07.835\nand wonder whether we could adopt those practices\n\n00:02:07.835 --> 00:02:10.532\nourselves.\n\n00:02:10.532 --> 00:02:13.619\nMost old people in the U.S. end up living\n\n00:02:13.619 --> 00:02:15.606\nseparately from their children\n\n00:02:15.606 --> 00:02:17.112\nand from most of their friends\n\n00:02:17.112 --> 00:02:18.804\nof their earlier years,\n\n00:02:18.804 --> 00:02:22.658\nand often they live in separate\nretirements homes for the elderly,\n\n00:02:22.658 --> 00:02:24.866\nwhereas in traditional societies,\n\n00:02:24.866 --> 00:02:27.700\nolder people instead live out their lives\n\n00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:29.866\namong their children, their other relatives,\n\n00:02:29.866 --> 00:02:32.263\nand their lifelong friends.\n\n00:02:32.263 --> 00:02:34.432\nNevertheless, the treatment of the elderly\n\n00:02:34.432 --> 00:02:37.597\nvaries enormously among traditional societies,\n\n00:02:37.597 --> 00:02:39.778\nfrom much worse to much better\n\n00:02:39.778 --> 00:02:42.736\nthan in our modern societies.\n\n00:02:42.736 --> 00:02:45.533\nAt the worst extreme, many traditional societies\n\n00:02:45.533 --> 00:02:47.346\nget rid of their elderly\n\n00:02:47.346 --> 00:02:50.877\nin one of four increasingly direct ways:\n\n00:02:50.877 --> 00:02:52.540\nby neglecting their elderly\n\n00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:55.969\nand not feeding or cleaning them until they die,\n\n00:02:55.969 --> 00:02:59.023\nor by abandoning them when the group moves,\n\n00:02:59.023 --> 00:03:02.162\nor by encouraging older people to commit suicide,\n\n00:03:02.162 --> 00:03:05.207\nor by killing older people.\n\n00:03:05.207 --> 00:03:07.956\nIn which tribal societies do children\n\n00:03:07.956 --> 00:03:10.342\nabandon or kill their parents?\n\n00:03:10.342 --> 00:03:13.366\nIt happens mainly under two conditions.\n\n00:03:13.366 --> 00:03:16.346\nOne is in nomadic, hunter-gather societies\n\n00:03:16.346 --> 00:03:18.069\nthat often shift camp\n\n00:03:18.069 --> 00:03:20.248\nand that are physically incapable\n\n00:03:20.248 --> 00:03:23.371\nof transporting old people who can't walk\n\n00:03:23.371 --> 00:03:25.931\nwhen the able-bodied younger people already\n\n00:03:25.931 --> 00:03:27.866\nhave to carry their young children\n\n00:03:27.866 --> 00:03:30.684\nand all their physical possessions.\n\n00:03:30.684 --> 00:03:32.848\nThe other condition is in societies\n\n00:03:32.848 --> 00:03:36.158\nliving in marginal or fluctuating environments,\n\n00:03:36.158 --> 00:03:38.491\nsuch as the Arctic or deserts,\n\n00:03:38.491 --> 00:03:41.075\nwhere there are periodic food shortages,\n\n00:03:41.075 --> 00:03:43.004\nand occasionally there just isn't enough food\n\n00:03:43.004 --> 00:03:45.484\nto keep everyone alive.\n\n00:03:45.484 --> 00:03:47.908\nWhatever food is available has to be reserved\n\n00:03:47.908 --> 00:03:52.233\nfor able-bodied adults and for children.\n\n00:03:52.233 --> 00:03:55.133\nTo us Americans, it sounds horrible\n\n00:03:55.133 --> 00:03:57.366\nto think of abandoning or killing\n\n00:03:57.366 --> 00:03:59.547\nyour own sick wife or husband\n\n00:03:59.547 --> 00:04:01.846\nor elderly mother or father,\n\n00:04:01.846 --> 00:04:05.605\nbut what could those traditional societies\n\n00:04:05.605 --> 00:04:07.088\ndo differently?\n\n00:04:07.088 --> 00:04:10.908\nThey face a cruel situation of no choice.\n\n00:04:10.908 --> 00:04:13.903\nTheir old people had to do it to their own parents,\n\n00:04:13.903 --> 00:04:15.191\nand the old people know\n\n00:04:15.191 --> 00:04:18.342\nwhat now is going to happen to them.\n\n00:04:18.342 --> 00:04:20.156\nAt the opposite extreme\n\n00:04:20.156 --> 00:04:22.835\nin treatment of the elderly, the happy extreme,\n\n00:04:22.835 --> 00:04:24.822\nare the New Guinea farming societies\n\n00:04:24.822 --> 00:04:27.819\nwhere I've been doing my fieldwork \nfor the past 50 years,\n\n00:04:27.819 --> 00:04:31.066\nand most other sedentary traditional societies\n\n00:04:31.066 --> 00:04:33.152\naround the world.\n\n00:04:33.152 --> 00:04:36.100\nIn those societies, older people are cared for.\n\n00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:38.450\nThey are fed. They remain valuable.\n\n00:04:38.450 --> 00:04:40.638\nAnd they continue to live in the same hut\n\n00:04:40.638 --> 00:04:43.325\nor else in a nearby hut near their children,\n\n00:04:43.325 --> 00:04:47.224\nrelatives and lifelong friends.\n\n00:04:47.224 --> 00:04:49.656\nThere are two main sets of reasons for this variation\n\n00:04:49.656 --> 00:04:52.011\namong societies in their treatment\n\n00:04:52.011 --> 00:04:53.408\nof old people.\n\n00:04:53.408 --> 00:04:55.045\nThe variation depends especially\n\n00:04:55.045 --> 00:04:57.315\non the usefulness of old people\n\n00:04:57.315 --> 00:05:00.028\nand on the society's values.\n\n00:05:00.028 --> 00:05:02.351\nFirst, as regards usefulness,\n\n00:05:02.351 --> 00:05:05.806\nolder people continue to perform useful services.\n\n00:05:05.806 --> 00:05:08.491\nOne use of older people in traditional societies\n\n00:05:08.491 --> 00:05:10.491\nis that they often are still effective\n\n00:05:10.491 --> 00:05:12.904\nat producing food.\n\n00:05:12.904 --> 00:05:15.317\nAnother traditional usefulness of older people\n\n00:05:15.317 --> 00:05:18.596\nis that they are capable of babysitting\n\n00:05:18.596 --> 00:05:20.290\ntheir grandchildren,\n\n00:05:20.290 --> 00:05:22.960\nthereby freeing up their own adult children,\n\n00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:24.831\nthe parents of those grandchildren,\n\n00:05:24.831 --> 00:05:28.304\nto go hunting and gathering\nfood for the grandchildren.\n\n00:05:28.304 --> 00:05:30.509\nStill another traditional value of older people\n\n00:05:30.509 --> 00:05:33.429\nis in making tools, weapons, baskets,\n\n00:05:33.429 --> 00:05:35.386\npots and textiles.\n\n00:05:35.386 --> 00:05:38.635\nIn fact, they're usually the people who are best at it.\n\n00:05:38.635 --> 00:05:41.403\nOlder people usually are the leaders\n\n00:05:41.403 --> 00:05:43.252\nof traditional societies,\n\n00:05:43.252 --> 00:05:46.511\nand the people most knowledgeable about politics,\n\n00:05:46.511 --> 00:05:50.510\nmedicine, religion, songs and dances.\n\n00:05:50.510 --> 00:05:52.962\nFinally, older people in traditional societies\n\n00:05:52.962 --> 00:05:56.889\nhave a huge significance that would never occur\n\n00:05:56.889 --> 00:06:00.565\nto us in our modern, literate societies,\n\n00:06:00.565 --> 00:06:02.980\nwhere our sources of information are books\n\n00:06:02.980 --> 00:06:04.664\nand the Internet.\n\n00:06:04.664 --> 00:06:08.087\nIn contrast, in traditional societies without writing,\n\n00:06:08.087 --> 00:06:11.773\nolder people are the repositories of information.\n\n00:06:11.773 --> 00:06:14.338\nIt's their knowledge that spells the difference\n\n00:06:14.338 --> 00:06:18.088\nbetween survival and death for their whole society\n\n00:06:18.088 --> 00:06:21.346\nin a time of crisis caused by rare events\n\n00:06:21.346 --> 00:06:23.941\nfor which only the oldest people alive\n\n00:06:23.941 --> 00:06:26.230\nhave had experience.\n\n00:06:26.230 --> 00:06:28.700\nThose, then, are the ways in which older people\n\n00:06:28.700 --> 00:06:31.603\nare useful in traditional societies.\n\n00:06:31.603 --> 00:06:34.165\nTheir usefulness varies and contributes\n\n00:06:34.165 --> 00:06:36.783\nto variation in the society's treatment\n\n00:06:36.783 --> 00:06:38.783\nof the elderly.\n\n00:06:38.783 --> 00:06:40.602\nThe other set of reasons for variation\n\n00:06:40.602 --> 00:06:42.477\nin the treatment of the elderly is\n\n00:06:42.477 --> 00:06:45.712\nthe society's cultural values.\n\n00:06:45.712 --> 00:06:47.738\nFor example, there's particular emphasis\n\n00:06:47.738 --> 00:06:50.947\non respect for the elderly in East Asia,\n\n00:06:50.947 --> 00:06:53.858\nassociated with Confucius' doctrine\n\n00:06:53.858 --> 00:06:57.408\nof filial piety, which means obedience,\n\n00:06:57.408 --> 00:07:01.502\nrespect and support for elderly parents.\n\n00:07:01.502 --> 00:07:05.215\nCultural values that emphasize\nrespect for older people\n\n00:07:05.215 --> 00:07:08.032\ncontrast with the low status of the elderly\n\n00:07:08.032 --> 00:07:10.194\nin the U.S.\n\n00:07:10.194 --> 00:07:12.752\nOlder Americans are at a big disadvantage\n\n00:07:12.752 --> 00:07:14.865\nin job applications.\n\n00:07:14.865 --> 00:07:17.400\nThey're at a big disadvantage in hospitals.\n\n00:07:17.400 --> 00:07:20.023\nOur hospitals have an explicit policy\n\n00:07:20.023 --> 00:07:24.990\ncalled age-based allocation of healthcare resources.\n\n00:07:24.990 --> 00:07:27.763\nThat sinister expression means that\n\n00:07:27.763 --> 00:07:29.969\nif hospital resources are limited,\n\n00:07:29.969 --> 00:07:32.019\nfor example if only one donor heart\n\n00:07:32.019 --> 00:07:34.317\nbecomes available for transplant,\n\n00:07:34.317 --> 00:07:36.419\nor if a surgeon has time to operate\n\n00:07:36.419 --> 00:07:38.930\non only a certain number of patients,\n\n00:07:38.930 --> 00:07:41.880\nAmerican hospitals have an explicit policy\n\n00:07:41.880 --> 00:07:44.200\nof giving preference to younger patients\n\n00:07:44.200 --> 00:07:45.680\nover older patients\n\n00:07:45.680 --> 00:07:48.924\non the grounds that younger patients are considered\n\n00:07:48.924 --> 00:07:50.741\nmore valuable to society\n\n00:07:50.741 --> 00:07:53.386\nbecause they have more years of life ahead of them,\n\n00:07:53.386 --> 00:07:56.046\neven though the younger patients have fewer years\n\n00:07:56.046 --> 00:08:00.028\nof valuable life experience behind them.\n\n00:08:00.028 --> 00:08:02.256\nThere are several reasons for this low status\n\n00:08:02.256 --> 00:08:04.598\nof the elderly in the U.S.\n\n00:08:04.598 --> 00:08:07.783\nOne is our Protestant work ethic\n\n00:08:07.783 --> 00:08:10.096\nwhich places high value on work,\n\n00:08:10.096 --> 00:08:12.319\nso older people who are no longer working\n\n00:08:12.319 --> 00:08:14.302\naren't respected.\n\n00:08:14.302 --> 00:08:17.159\nAnother reason is our American emphasis\n\n00:08:17.159 --> 00:08:20.542\non the virtues of self-reliance and independence,\n\n00:08:20.542 --> 00:08:23.611\nso we instinctively look down on older people\n\n00:08:23.611 --> 00:08:27.208\nwho are no longer self-reliant and independent.\n\n00:08:27.208 --> 00:08:31.309\nStill a third reason is our American cult of youth,\n\n00:08:31.309 --> 00:08:34.117\nwhich shows up even in our advertisements.\n\n00:08:34.117 --> 00:08:37.381\nAds for Coca-Cola and beer always depict\n\n00:08:37.381 --> 00:08:38.936\nsmiling young people,\n\n00:08:38.936 --> 00:08:40.906\neven though old as well as young people\n\n00:08:40.906 --> 00:08:43.228\nbuy and drink Coca-Cola and beer.\n\n00:08:43.228 --> 00:08:45.231\nJust think, what's the last time you saw\n\n00:08:45.231 --> 00:08:47.908\na Coke or beer ad depicting smiling people\n\n00:08:47.908 --> 00:08:50.857\n85 years old? Never.\n\n00:08:50.857 --> 00:08:52.663\nInstead, the only American ads\n\n00:08:52.663 --> 00:08:54.669\nfeaturing white-haired old people\n\n00:08:54.669 --> 00:08:58.534\nare ads for retirement homes and pension planning.\n\n00:08:58.534 --> 00:09:00.584\nWell, what has changed in the status\n\n00:09:00.584 --> 00:09:02.567\nof the elderly today\n\n00:09:02.567 --> 00:09:05.956\ncompared to their status in traditional societies?\n\n00:09:05.956 --> 00:09:07.826\nThere have been a few changes for the better\n\n00:09:07.826 --> 00:09:10.031\nand more changes for the worse.\n\n00:09:10.031 --> 00:09:11.632\nBig changes for the better\n\n00:09:11.632 --> 00:09:13.783\ninclude the fact that today we enjoy\n\n00:09:13.783 --> 00:09:15.767\nmuch longer lives,\n\n00:09:15.767 --> 00:09:18.061\nmuch better health in our old age,\n\n00:09:18.061 --> 00:09:21.699\nand much better recreational opportunities.\n\n00:09:21.699 --> 00:09:23.969\nAnother change for the better is that we now have\n\n00:09:23.969 --> 00:09:26.809\nspecialized retirement facilities\n\n00:09:26.809 --> 00:09:30.160\nand programs to take care of old people.\n\n00:09:30.160 --> 00:09:33.028\nChanges for the worse begin with the cruel reality\n\n00:09:33.028 --> 00:09:34.717\nthat we now have\n\n00:09:34.717 --> 00:09:37.291\nmore old people and fewer young people\n\n00:09:37.291 --> 00:09:39.975\nthan at any time in the past.\n\n00:09:39.975 --> 00:09:41.726\nThat means that all those old people\n\n00:09:41.726 --> 00:09:44.151\nare more of a burden on the few young people,\n\n00:09:44.151 --> 00:09:48.637\nand that each old person has less individual value.\n\n00:09:48.637 --> 00:09:51.821\nAnother big change for the worse\nin the status of the elderly\n\n00:09:51.821 --> 00:09:54.498\nis the breaking of social ties with age,\n\n00:09:54.498 --> 00:09:56.342\nbecause older people, their children,\n\n00:09:56.342 --> 00:09:57.658\nand their friends,\n\n00:09:57.658 --> 00:10:00.508\nall move and scatter independently of each other\n\n00:10:00.508 --> 00:10:02.762\nmany times during their lives.\n\n00:10:02.762 --> 00:10:04.575\nWe Americans move on the average\n\n00:10:04.575 --> 00:10:06.528\nevery five years.\n\n00:10:06.528 --> 00:10:08.559\nHence our older people are likely\n\n00:10:08.559 --> 00:10:10.866\nto end up living distant from their children\n\n00:10:10.866 --> 00:10:13.669\nand the friends of their youth.\n\n00:10:13.669 --> 00:10:16.831\nYet another change for the worse\nin the status of the elderly\n\n00:10:16.831 --> 00:10:20.561\nis formal retirement from the workforce,\n\n00:10:20.561 --> 00:10:23.311\ncarrying with it a loss of work friendships\n\n00:10:23.311 --> 00:10:27.451\nand a loss of the self-esteem associated with work.\n\n00:10:27.451 --> 00:10:29.936\nPerhaps the biggest change for the worse\n\n00:10:29.936 --> 00:10:32.809\nis that our elderly are objectively\n\n00:10:32.809 --> 00:10:35.971\nless useful than in traditional societies.\n\n00:10:35.971 --> 00:10:38.934\nWidespread literacy means that they are no longer\n\n00:10:38.934 --> 00:10:41.565\nuseful as repositories of knowledge.\n\n00:10:41.565 --> 00:10:43.508\nWhen we want some information,\n\n00:10:43.508 --> 00:10:45.769\nwe look it up in a book or we Google it\n\n00:10:45.769 --> 00:10:49.239\ninstead of finding some old person to ask.\n\n00:10:49.239 --> 00:10:51.326\nThe slow pace of technological change\n\n00:10:51.326 --> 00:10:53.148\nin traditional societies\n\n00:10:53.148 --> 00:10:55.998\nmeans that what someone learns there as a child\n\n00:10:55.998 --> 00:10:58.657\nis still useful when that person is old,\n\n00:10:58.657 --> 00:11:02.260\nbut the rapid pace of technological change today\n\n00:11:02.260 --> 00:11:04.327\nmeans that what we learn as children\n\n00:11:04.327 --> 00:11:07.217\nis no longer useful 60 years later.\n\n00:11:07.217 --> 00:11:09.596\nAnd conversely, we older people are not fluent\n\n00:11:09.596 --> 00:11:12.630\nin the technologies essential for surviving\n\n00:11:12.630 --> 00:11:14.601\nin modern society.\n\n00:11:14.601 --> 00:11:16.774\nFor example, as a 15-year-old,\n\n00:11:16.774 --> 00:11:20.364\nI was considered outstandingly\ngood at multiplying numbers\n\n00:11:20.364 --> 00:11:23.559\nbecause I had memorized the multiplication tables\n\n00:11:23.559 --> 00:11:25.704\nand I know how to use logarithms\n\n00:11:25.704 --> 00:11:28.567\nand I'm quick at manipulating a slide rule.\n\n00:11:28.567 --> 00:11:31.653\nToday, though, those skills are utterly useless\n\n00:11:31.653 --> 00:11:34.024\nbecause any idiot\n\n00:11:34.024 --> 00:11:36.382\ncan now multiply eight-digit numbers\n\n00:11:36.382 --> 00:11:39.569\naccurately and instantly with a pocket calculator.\n\n00:11:39.569 --> 00:11:41.739\nConversely, I at age 75\n\n00:11:41.739 --> 00:11:44.403\nam incompetent at skills\n\n00:11:44.403 --> 00:11:46.857\nessential for everyday life.\n\n00:11:46.857 --> 00:11:49.641\nMy family's first TV set in 1948\n\n00:11:49.641 --> 00:11:52.694\nhad only three knobs that I quickly mastered:\n\n00:11:52.694 --> 00:11:55.444\nan on-off switch, a volume knob,\n\n00:11:55.444 --> 00:11:57.665\nand a channel selector knob.\n\n00:11:57.665 --> 00:11:59.753\nToday, just to watch a program\n\n00:11:59.753 --> 00:12:02.209\non the TV set in my own house,\n\n00:12:02.209 --> 00:12:05.926\nI have to operate a 41-button TV remote\n\n00:12:05.926 --> 00:12:07.908\nthat utterly defeats me.\n\n00:12:07.908 --> 00:12:10.922\nI have to telephone my 25-year-old sons\n\n00:12:10.922 --> 00:12:13.119\nand ask them to talk me through it\n\n00:12:13.119 --> 00:12:18.116\nwhile I try to push those wretched 41 buttons.\n\n00:12:18.116 --> 00:12:20.763\nWhat can we do to improve the lives of the elderly\n\n00:12:20.763 --> 00:12:24.217\nin the U.S., and to make better use of their value?\n\n00:12:24.217 --> 00:12:25.991\nThat's a huge problem.\n\n00:12:25.991 --> 00:12:28.462\nIn my remaining four minutes today,\n\n00:12:28.462 --> 00:12:31.039\nI can offer just a few suggestions.\n\n00:12:31.039 --> 00:12:32.961\nOne value of older people is that they are\n\n00:12:32.961 --> 00:12:36.405\nincreasingly useful as grandparents\n\n00:12:36.405 --> 00:12:38.912\nfor offering high-quality childcare\n\n00:12:38.912 --> 00:12:41.565\nto their grandchildren, if they choose to do it,\n\n00:12:41.565 --> 00:12:44.414\nas more young women enter the workforce\n\n00:12:44.414 --> 00:12:46.748\nand as fewer young parents of either gender\n\n00:12:46.748 --> 00:12:50.408\nstay home as full-time caretakers of their children.\n\n00:12:50.408 --> 00:12:52.444\nCompared to the usual alternatives\n\n00:12:52.444 --> 00:12:56.042\nof paid babysitters and day care centers,\n\n00:12:56.042 --> 00:12:59.169\ngrandparents offer superior, motivated,\n\n00:12:59.169 --> 00:13:01.857\nexperienced child care.\n\n00:13:01.857 --> 00:13:05.123\nThey've already gained experience\nfrom raising their own children.\n\n00:13:05.123 --> 00:13:07.467\nThey usually love their grandchildren,\n\n00:13:07.467 --> 00:13:10.132\nand are eager to spend time with them.\n\n00:13:10.132 --> 00:13:12.033\nUnlike other caregivers,\n\n00:13:12.033 --> 00:13:14.930\ngrandparents don't quit their job\n\n00:13:14.930 --> 00:13:17.366\nbecause they found another job with higher pay\n\n00:13:17.366 --> 00:13:20.879\nlooking after another baby.\n\n00:13:20.879 --> 00:13:23.283\nA second value of older people is paradoxically\n\n00:13:23.283 --> 00:13:25.944\nrelated to their loss of value\n\n00:13:25.944 --> 00:13:30.017\nas a result of changing world\nconditions and technology.\n\n00:13:30.017 --> 00:13:32.053\nAt the same time, older people have gained\n\n00:13:32.053 --> 00:13:34.364\nin value today precisely because\n\n00:13:34.364 --> 00:13:37.473\nof their unique experience of living conditions\n\n00:13:37.473 --> 00:13:39.192\nthat have now become rare\n\n00:13:39.192 --> 00:13:42.502\nbecause of rapid change, but that could come back.\n\n00:13:42.502 --> 00:13:45.456\nFor example, only Americans now in their 70s\n\n00:13:45.456 --> 00:13:47.716\nor older today can remember\n\n00:13:47.716 --> 00:13:51.044\nthe experience of living through a great depression,\n\n00:13:51.044 --> 00:13:53.682\nthe experience of living through a world war,\n\n00:13:53.682 --> 00:13:56.228\nand agonizing whether or not\n\n00:13:56.228 --> 00:13:59.265\ndropping atomic bombs would be more horrible\n\n00:13:59.265 --> 00:14:03.378\nthan the likely consequences\nof not dropping atomic bombs.\n\n00:14:03.378 --> 00:14:05.654\nMost of our current voters and politicians\n\n00:14:05.654 --> 00:14:08.386\nhave no personal experience of any of those things,\n\n00:14:08.386 --> 00:14:11.081\nbut millions of older Americans do.\n\n00:14:11.081 --> 00:14:13.732\nUnfortunately, all of those terrible situations\n\n00:14:13.732 --> 00:14:15.119\ncould come back.\n\n00:14:15.119 --> 00:14:16.425\nEven if they don't come back,\n\n00:14:16.425 --> 00:14:18.617\nwe have to be able to plan for them\n\n00:14:18.617 --> 00:14:21.428\non the basis of the experience of what they were like.\n\n00:14:21.428 --> 00:14:23.262\nOlder people have that experience.\n\n00:14:23.262 --> 00:14:25.315\nYounger people don't.\n\n00:14:25.315 --> 00:14:26.835\nThe remaining value of older people\n\n00:14:26.835 --> 00:14:29.278\nthat I'll mention involves recognizing that\n\n00:14:29.278 --> 00:14:31.858\nwhile there are many things that older people\n\n00:14:31.858 --> 00:14:33.464\ncan no longer do,\n\n00:14:33.464 --> 00:14:34.953\nthere are other things that they can do\n\n00:14:34.953 --> 00:14:37.048\nbetter than younger people.\n\n00:14:37.048 --> 00:14:39.944\nA challenge for society is \nto make use of those things\n\n00:14:39.944 --> 00:14:42.416\nthat older people are better at doing.\n\n00:14:42.416 --> 00:14:45.665\nSome abilities, of course, decrease with age.\n\n00:14:45.665 --> 00:14:48.303\nThose include abilities at tasks\n\n00:14:48.303 --> 00:14:51.874\nrequiring physical strength and stamina,\n\n00:14:51.874 --> 00:14:54.998\nambition, and the power of novel reasoning\n\n00:14:54.998 --> 00:14:57.423\nin a circumscribed situation,\n\n00:14:57.423 --> 00:15:00.011\nsuch as figuring out the structure of DNA,\n\n00:15:00.011 --> 00:15:03.912\nbest left to scientists under the age of 30.\n\n00:15:03.912 --> 00:15:05.561\nConversely, valuable attributes\n\n00:15:05.561 --> 00:15:09.107\nthat increase with age include experience,\n\n00:15:09.107 --> 00:15:12.120\nunderstanding of people and human relationships,\n\n00:15:12.120 --> 00:15:14.411\nability to help other people\n\n00:15:14.411 --> 00:15:16.839\nwithout your own ego getting in the way,\n\n00:15:16.839 --> 00:15:20.364\nand interdisciplinary thinking about large databases,\n\n00:15:20.364 --> 00:15:23.189\nsuch as economics and comparative history,\n\n00:15:23.189 --> 00:15:26.403\nbest left to scholars over the age of 60.\n\n00:15:26.403 --> 00:15:28.875\nHence older people are\nmuch better than younger people\n\n00:15:28.875 --> 00:15:32.846\nat supervising, administering, advising,\n\n00:15:32.846 --> 00:15:36.328\nstrategizing, teaching, synthesizing,\n\n00:15:36.328 --> 00:15:39.034\nand devising long-term plans.\n\n00:15:39.034 --> 00:15:41.054\nI've seen this value of older people\n\n00:15:41.054 --> 00:15:43.626\nwith so many of my friends in their 60s,\n\n00:15:43.626 --> 00:15:45.616\n70s, 80s and 90s,\n\n00:15:45.616 --> 00:15:48.901\nwho are still active as investment managers,\n\n00:15:48.901 --> 00:15:51.914\nfarmers, lawyers and doctors.\n\n00:15:51.914 --> 00:15:54.044\nIn short, many traditional societies\n\n00:15:54.044 --> 00:15:56.157\nmake better use of their elderly\n\n00:15:56.157 --> 00:15:59.267\nand give their elderly more satisfying lives\n\n00:15:59.267 --> 00:16:02.117\nthan we do in modern, big societies.\n\n00:16:02.117 --> 00:16:03.982\nParadoxically nowadays,\n\n00:16:03.982 --> 00:16:06.908\nwhen we have more elderly people than ever before,\n\n00:16:06.908 --> 00:16:09.629\nliving healthier lives and with better medical care\n\n00:16:09.629 --> 00:16:11.115\nthan ever before,\n\n00:16:11.115 --> 00:16:13.822\nold age is in some respects more miserable\n\n00:16:13.822 --> 00:16:15.589\nthan ever before.\n\n00:16:15.589 --> 00:16:18.011\nThe lives of the elderly are widely recognized\n\n00:16:18.011 --> 00:16:20.778\nas constituting a disaster area\n\n00:16:20.778 --> 00:16:23.311\nof modern

"https://www.ted.com/talks/suzana_herculano_houzel_what_is_so_special_about_the_human_brain", "transcript": "What is so special about the human brain? Why is it that we study other animals instead of them studying us? What does a human brain have or do that no other brain does? When I became interested in these questions about 10 years ago, scientists thought they knew what different brains were made of. Though it was based on very little evidence, many scientists thought that all mammalian brains, including the human brain, were made in the same way, with a number of neurons that was always proportional to the size of the brain. This means that two brains of the same size, like these two, with a respectable 400 grams, should have similar numbers of neurons. Now, if neurons are the functional information processing units of the brain, then the owners of these two brains should have similar cognitive abilities. And yet, one is a chimp, and the other is a cow. Now maybe cows have a really rich internal mental life and are so smart that they choose not to let us realize it, but we eat them. I think most people will agree that chimps are capable of much more complex, elaborate and flexible behaviors than cows are. So this is a first indication that the \"all brains are made the same way\" scenario is not quite right.But let's play along. If all brains were made the same way and you were to compare animals with brains of different sizes, larger brains should always have more neurons than smaller brains, and the larger the brain, the more cognitively able its owner should be. So the largest brain around should also be the most cognitively able. And here comes the bad news: Our brain, not the largest one around. It seems quite vexing. Our brain weighs between 1.2 and 1.5 kilos, but elephant brains weigh between four and five kilos, and whale brains can weigh up to nine kilos, which is why scientists used to resort to saying that our brain must be special to explain our cognitive abilities. It must be really extraordinary, an exception to the rule. Theirs may be bigger, but ours is better, and it could be better, for example, in that it seems larger than it should be, with a much larger cerebral cortex than we should have for the size of our bodies. So that would give us extra cortex to do more interesting things than just operating the body. That's because the size of the brain usually follows the size of the body. So the main reason for saying that our brain is larger than it should be actually comes from comparing ourselves to great apes. Gorillas can be two to three times larger than we are, so their brains should also be larger than ours, but instead it's the other way around. Our brain is three times larger than a gorilla brain.The human brain also seems special in the amount of energy that it uses. Although it weighs only two percent of the body, it alone uses 25 percent of all the energy that your body requires to run per day. That's 500 calories out of a total of 2,000 calories, just to keep your brain working.So the human brain is larger than it should be, it uses much more energy than it should, so it's special. And this is where the story started to bother me. In biology, we look for rules that apply to all animals and to life in general, so why should the rules of evolution apply to everybody else but not to us? Maybe the problem was with the basic assumption that all brains are made in the same way. Maybe two brains of a similar size can actually be made of very different numbers of neurons. Maybe a very large brain does not necessarily have more neurons than a more modest-sized brain. Maybe the human brain  actually has the most neurons of any brain, regardless of its size, especially in the cerebral cortex. So this to me became the important question to answer: how many neurons does the human brain have, and how does that compare to other animals?Now, you may have heard or read somewhere that we have 100 billion neurons, so 10 years ago, I asked my colleagues if they knew where this number came from. But nobody did. I've been digging through the literature for the original reference for that number, and I could never find it. It seems that nobody had actually ever counted the number of neurons in the human brain, or in any other brain for that matter.So I came up with my own way to count cells in the brain, and it essentially consists of dissolving that brain into soup. It works like this: You take a brain, or parts of that brain, and you dissolve it in detergent, which destroys the cell membranes but keeps the cell nuclei intact, so you end up with a suspension of free nuclei that looks like this, like a clear soup. This soup contains all the nuclei that once were a mouse brain. Now, the beauty of a soup is that because it is soup, you can agitate it and make those nuclei be distributed homogeneously in the liquid, so that now by looking under the microscope at just four or five samples of this homogeneous solution, you can count nuclei, and therefore tell how many cells that brain had. It's simple, it's straightforward, and it's really fast. So we've used that method to count neurons in dozens of different species so far, and it turns out that all brains are not made the same way. Take rodents and primates, for instance: In larger rodent brains, the average size of the neuron increases, so the brain inflates very rapidly and gains size much faster than it gains neurons. But primate brains gain neurons without the average neuron becoming any larger, which is a very economical way to add neurons to your brain. The result is that a primate brain will always have more neurons than a rodent brain of the same size, and the larger the brain, the larger this difference will be. Well, what about our brain then? We found that we have, on average, 86 billion neurons, 16 billion of which are in the cerebral cortex, and if you consider that the cerebral cortex is the seat of functions like awareness and logical and abstract reasoning, and that 16 billion is the most neurons that any cortex has, I think this is the simplest explanation for our remarkable cognitive abilities. But just as important is what the 86 billion neurons mean. Because we found that the relationship between the size of the brain and its number of neurons could be described mathematically, we could calculate what a human brain would look like if it was made like a rodent brain. So, a rodent brain with 86 billion neurons would weigh 36 kilos. That's not possible. A brain that huge would be crushed by its own weight, and this impossible brain would go in the body of 89 tons. I don't think it looks like us.So this brings us to a very important conclusion already, which is that we are not rodents. The human brain is not a large rat brain. Compared to a rat, we might seem special, yes, but that's not a fair comparison to make, given that we know that we are not rodents. We are primates, so the correct comparison is to other primates. And there, if you do the math, you find that a generic primate with 86 billion neurons would have a brain of about 1.2 kilos, which seems just right, in a body of some 66 kilos, which in my case is exactly right, which brings us to a very unsurprising but still incredibly important conclusion: I am a primate. And all of you are primates.And so was Darwin. I love to think that Darwin would have really appreciated this. His brain, like ours, was made in the image of other primate brains.So the human brain may be remarkable, yes, but it is not special in its number of neurons. It is just a large primate brain. I think that's a very humbling and sobering thought that should remind us of our place in nature.Why does it cost so much energy, then? Well, other people have figured out how much energy the human brain and that of other species costs, and now that we knew how many neurons each brain was made of, we could do the math. And it turns out that both human and other brains cost about the same, an average of six calories  per billion neurons per day. So the total energetic cost of a brain is a simple, linear function of its number of neurons, and it turns out that the human brain costs just as much energy as you would expect. So the reason why the human brain costs so much energy is simply because it has a huge number of neurons, and because we are primates with many more neurons for a given body size than any other animal, the relative cost of our brain is large, but just because we're primates, not because we're special.Last question, then: how did we come by this remarkable number of neurons, and in particular, if great apes are larger than we are, why don't they have a larger brain  than we do, with more neurons? When we realized how much expensive it is to have a lot of neurons in the brain, I figured, maybe there's a simple reason. They just can't afford the energy for both a large body  and a large number of neurons. So we did the math. We calculated on the one hand how much energy a primate gets per day from eating raw foods, and on the other hand, how much energy a body of a certain size costs and how much energy a brain of a certain number of neurons costs, and we looked for the combinations of body size and number of brain neurons that a primate could afford if it ate a certain number of hours per day.And what we found is that because neurons are so expensive, there is a tradeoff between body size and number of neurons. So a primate that eats eight hours per day can afford at most 53 billion neurons, but then its body cannot be any bigger than 25 kilos. To weigh any more than that, it has to give up neurons. So it's either a large body or a large number of neurons. When you eat like a primate, you can't afford both.One way out of this metabolic limitation would be to spend even more hours per day eating, but that gets dangerous, and past a certain point, it's just not possible. Gorillas and orangutans, for instance, afford about 30 billion neurons by spending eight and a half hours per day eating, and that seems to be about as much as they can do. Nine hours of feeding per day seems to be the practical limit for a primate.What about us? With our 86 billion neurons and 60 to 70 kilos of body mass, we should have to spend over nine hours per day every single day feeding, which is just not feasible. If we ate like a primate, we should not be here.How did we get here, then? Well, if our brain costs just as much energy as it should, and if we can't spend every waking hour of the day feeding, then the only alternative, really, is to somehow get more energy out of the same foods. And remarkably, that matches exactly what our ancestors are believed to have invented one and a half million years ago, when they invented cooking. To cook is to use fire to pre-digest foods outside of your body. Cooked foods are softer, so they're easier to chew and to turn completely into mush in your mouth, so that allows them to be completely digested and absorbed in your gut, which makes them yield much more energy in much less time. So cooking frees time for us to do much more interesting things with our day and with our neurons than just thinking about food, looking for food, and gobbling down food all day long.So because of cooking, what once was a major liability, this large, dangerously expensive brain with a lot of neurons, could now become a major asset, now that we could both afford  the energy for a lot of neurons and the time to do interesting things with them. So I think this explains why the human brain grew to become so large so fast in evolution, all of the while remaining just a primate brain. With this large brain now affordable by cooking, we went rapidly from raw foods to culture, agriculture, civilization, grocery stores, electricity, refrigerators, all of those things that nowadays allow us to get all the energy we need for the whole day in a single sitting at your favorite fast food joint. So what once was a solution now became the problem, and ironically, we look for the solution in raw food.So what is the human advantage? What is it that we have that no other animal has? My answer is that we have the largest number of neurons in the cerebral cortex, and I think that's the simplest explanation for our remarkable cognitive abilities. And what is it that we do that no other animal does, and which I believe was fundamental to allow us to reach that large, largest number of neurons in the cortex? In two words, we cook. No other animal cooks its food. Only humans do. And I think that's how we got to become human.Studying the human brain changed  the way I think about food. I now look at my kitchen, and I bow to it, and I thank my ancestors for coming up with the invention that probably made us humans. Thank you very much.

actually be made of\nvery different numbers of neurons.\n\n00:03:35.121 --> 00:03:36.728\nMaybe a very large brain\n\n00:03:36.728 --> 00:03:38.568\ndoes not necessarily have more neurons\n\n00:03:38.568 --> 00:03:40.789\nthan a more modest-sized brain.\n\n00:03:40.789 --> 00:03:43.798\nMaybe the human brain \nactually has the most neurons\n\n00:03:43.798 --> 00:03:46.371\nof any brain, regardless of its size,\n\n00:03:46.371 --> 00:03:48.465\nespecially in the cerebral cortex.\n\n00:03:48.465 --> 00:03:50.017\nSo this to me became\n\n00:03:50.017 --> 00:03:51.746\nthe important question to answer:\n\n00:03:51.746 --> 00:03:54.146\nhow many neurons does the human brain have,\n\n00:03:54.146 --> 00:03:56.668\nand how does that compare to other animals?\n\n00:03:56.668 --> 00:03:59.091\nNow, you may have heard or read somewhere\n\n00:03:59.091 --> 00:04:01.202\nthat we have 100 billion neurons,\n\n00:04:01.202 --> 00:04:03.288\nso 10 years ago, I asked my colleagues\n\n00:04:03.288 --> 00:04:05.127\nif they knew where this number came from.\n\n00:04:05.127 --> 00:04:06.585\nBut nobody did.\n\n00:04:06.585 --> 00:04:08.038\nI've been digging through the literature\n\n00:04:08.038 --> 00:04:10.096\nfor the original reference for that number,\n\n00:04:10.096 --> 00:04:11.879\nand I could never find it.\n\n00:04:11.879 --> 00:04:14.618\nIt seems that nobody had actually ever counted\n\n00:04:14.618 --> 00:04:16.152\nthe number of neurons in the human brain,\n\n00:04:16.152 --> 00:04:18.651\nor in any other brain for that matter.\n\n00:04:18.651 --> 00:04:22.186\nSo I came up with my own way\nto count cells in the brain,\n\n00:04:22.186 --> 00:04:24.294\nand it essentially consists of\n\n00:04:24.294 --> 00:04:27.539\ndissolving that brain into soup.\n\n00:04:27.539 --> 00:04:29.576\nIt works like this:\n\n00:04:29.576 --> 00:04:32.703\nYou take a brain, or parts of that brain,\n\n00:04:32.703 --> 00:04:34.447\nand you dissolve it in detergent,\n\n00:04:34.447 --> 00:04:35.956\nwhich destroys the cell membranes\n\n00:04:35.956 --> 00:04:38.392\nbut keeps the cell nuclei intact,\n\n00:04:38.392 --> 00:04:41.532\nso you end up with a suspension of free nuclei\n\n00:04:41.532 --> 00:04:43.313\nthat looks like this,\n\n00:04:43.313 --> 00:04:44.586\nlike a clear soup.\n\n00:04:44.586 --> 00:04:46.477\nThis soup contains all the nuclei\n\n00:04:46.477 --> 00:04:48.531\nthat once were a mouse brain.\n\n00:04:48.531 --> 00:04:51.561\nNow, the beauty of a soup is that because it is soup,\n\n00:04:51.561 --> 00:04:54.459\nyou can agitate it and make those nuclei\n\n00:04:54.459 --> 00:04:56.430\nbe distributed homogeneously in the liquid,\n\n00:04:56.430 --> 00:04:58.411\nso that now by looking under the microscope\n\n00:04:58.411 --> 00:05:02.494\nat just four or five samples\nof this homogeneous solution,\n\n00:05:02.494 --> 00:05:05.030\nyou can count nuclei, and therefore tell\n\n00:05:05.030 --> 00:05:06.709\nhow many cells that brain had.\n\n00:05:06.709 --> 00:05:08.334\nIt's simple, it's straightforward,\n\n00:05:08.334 --> 00:05:09.768\nand it's really fast.\n\n00:05:09.768 --> 00:05:11.765\nSo we've used that method to count neurons\n\n00:05:11.765 --> 00:05:14.076\nin dozens of different species so far,\n\n00:05:14.076 --> 00:05:15.765\nand it turns out that all brains\n\n00:05:15.765 --> 00:05:18.347\nare not made the same way.\n\n00:05:18.347 --> 00:05:20.534\nTake rodents and primates, for instance:\n\n00:05:20.534 --> 00:05:22.818\nIn larger rodent brains, the average size\n\n00:05:22.818 --> 00:05:24.504\nof the neuron increases,\n\n00:05:24.504 --> 00:05:27.103\nso the brain inflates very rapidly\n\n00:05:27.103 --> 00:05:30.268\nand gains size much faster than it gains neurons.\n\n00:05:30.268 --> 00:05:31.971\nBut primate brains gain neurons\n\n00:05:31.971 --> 00:05:34.430\nwithout the average neuron becoming any larger,\n\n00:05:34.430 --> 00:05:35.955\nwhich is a very economical way\n\n00:05:35.955 --> 00:05:37.608\nto add neurons to your brain.\n\n00:05:37.608 --> 00:05:39.372\nThe result is that a primate brain\n\n00:05:39.372 --> 00:05:42.539\nwill always have more neurons than\na rodent brain of the same size,\n\n00:05:42.539 --> 00:05:44.022\nand the larger the brain,\n\n00:05:44.022 --> 00:05:46.236\nthe larger this difference will be.\n\n00:05:46.236 --> 00:05:48.339\nWell, what about our brain then?\n\n00:05:48.339 --> 00:05:50.023\nWe found that we have, on average,\n\n00:05:50.023 --> 00:05:51.808\n86 billion neurons,\n\n00:05:51.808 --> 00:05:54.807\n16 billion of which are in the cerebral cortex,\n\n00:05:54.807 --> 00:05:56.888\nand if you consider that the cerebral cortex\n\n00:05:56.888 --> 00:05:59.982\nis the seat of functions like\n\n00:05:59.982 --> 00:06:03.119\nawareness and logical and abstract reasoning,\n\n00:06:03.119 --> 00:06:06.103\nand that 16 billion is the most neurons\n\n00:06:06.103 --> 00:06:08.724\nthat any cortex has,\n\n00:06:08.724 --> 00:06:10.442\nI think this is the simplest explanation\n\n00:06:10.442 --> 00:06:13.584\nfor our remarkable cognitive abilities.\n\n00:06:13.584 --> 00:06:16.805\nBut just as important is what\nthe 86 billion neurons mean.\n\n00:06:16.805 --> 00:06:18.334\nBecause we found that the relationship\n\n00:06:18.334 --> 00:06:20.686\nbetween the size of the brain\nand its number of neurons\n\n00:06:20.686 --> 00:06:22.313\ncould be described mathematically,\n\n00:06:22.313 --> 00:06:24.531\nwe could calculate what a human brain\n\n00:06:24.531 --> 00:06:27.205\nwould look like if it was made like a rodent brain.\n\n00:06:27.205 --> 00:06:30.779\nSo, a rodent brain with 86 billion neurons\n\n00:06:30.779 --> 00:06:33.900\nwould weigh 36 kilos.\n\n00:06:33.900 --> 00:06:35.533\nThat's not possible.\n\n00:06:35.533 --> 00:06:37.439\nA brain that huge would be crushed\n\n00:06:37.439 --> 00:06:38.623\nby its own weight,\n\n00:06:38.623 --> 00:06:40.210\nand this impossible brain would go\n\n00:06:40.210 --> 00:06:43.981\nin the body of 89 tons.\n\n00:06:43.981 --> 00:06:46.115\nI don't think it looks like us.\n\n00:06:46.115 --> 00:06:48.668\nSo this brings us to a very important\nconclusion already,\n\n00:06:48.668 --> 00:06:51.315\nwhich is that we are not rodents.\n\n00:06:51.315 --> 00:06:54.583\nThe human brain is not a large rat brain.\n\n00:06:54.583 --> 00:06:57.211\nCompared to a rat, we might seem special, yes,\n\n00:06:57.211 --> 00:06:59.431\nbut that's not a fair comparison to make,\n\n00:06:59.431 --> 00:07:01.520\ngiven that we know that we are not rodents.\n\n00:07:01.520 --> 00:07:02.910\nWe are primates,\n\n00:07:02.910 --> 00:07:05.684\nso the correct comparison is to other primates.\n\n00:07:05.684 --> 00:07:06.911\nAnd there, if you do the math,\n\n00:07:06.911 --> 00:07:09.697\nyou find that a generic primate\n\n00:07:09.697 --> 00:07:11.627\nwith 86 billion neurons\n\n00:07:11.627 --> 00:07:14.630\nwould have a brain of about 1.2 kilos,\n\n00:07:14.630 --> 00:07:16.519\nwhich seems just right,\n\n00:07:16.519 --> 00:07:18.491\nin a body of some 66 kilos,\n\n00:07:18.491 --> 00:07:21.136\nwhich in my case is exactly right,\n\n00:07:21.136 --> 00:07:23.756\nwhich brings us to a very unsurprising\n\n00:07:23.756 --> 00:07:26.725\nbut still incredibly important conclusion:\n\n00:07:26.725 --> 00:07:28.066\nI am a primate.\n\n00:07:28.066 --> 00:07:30.764\nAnd all of you are primates.\n\n00:07:30.764 --> 00:07:32.664\nAnd so was Darwin.\n\n00:07:32.664 --> 00:07:35.604\nI love to think that Darwin\nwould have really appreciated this.\n\n00:07:35.604 --> 00:07:37.571\nHis brain, like ours,\n\n00:07:37.571 --> 00:07:41.082\nwas made in the image of other primate brains.\n\n00:07:41.082 --> 00:07:43.384\nSo the human brain may be remarkable, yes,\n\n00:07:43.384 --> 00:07:46.165\nbut it is not special in its number of neurons.\n\n00:07:46.165 --> 00:07:48.020\nIt is just a large primate brain.\n\n00:07:48.020 --> 00:07:51.064\nI think that's a very humbling and sobering thought\n\n00:07:51.064 --> 00:07:54.127\nthat should remind us of our place in nature.\n\n00:07:54.127 --> 00:07:56.771\nWhy does it cost so much energy, then?\n\n00:07:56.771 --> 00:07:58.218\nWell, other people have figured out\n\n00:07:58.218 --> 00:07:59.721\nhow much energy the human brain\n\n00:07:59.721 --> 00:08:01.128\nand that of other species costs,\n\n00:08:01.128 --> 00:08:02.780\nand now that we knew how many neurons\n\n00:08:02.780 --> 00:08:05.122\neach brain was made of, we could do the math.\n\n00:08:05.122 --> 00:08:06.988\nAnd it turns out that both human\n\n00:08:06.988 --> 00:08:09.811\nand other brains cost about the same,\n\n00:08:09.811 --> 00:08:13.232\nan average of six calories \nper billion neurons per day.\n\n00:08:13.232 --> 00:08:15.371\nSo the total energetic cost of a brain\n\n00:08:15.371 --> 00:08:17.405\nis a simple, linear function\n\n00:08:17.405 --> 00:08:19.114\nof its number of neurons,\n\n00:08:19.114 --> 00:08:21.297\nand it turns out that the human brain\n\n00:08:21.297 --> 00:08:25.138\ncosts just as much energy as you would expect.\n\n00:08:25.138 --> 00:08:27.229\nSo the reason why the human brain\n\n00:08:27.229 --> 00:08:28.901\ncosts so much energy is simply because\n\n00:08:28.901 --> 00:08:30.884\nit has a huge number of neurons,\n\n00:08:30.884 --> 00:08:32.369\nand because we are primates\n\n00:08:32.369 --> 00:08:34.868\nwith many more neurons for a given body size\n\n00:08:34.868 --> 00:08:36.390\nthan any other animal,\n\n00:08:36.390 --> 00:08:39.930\nthe relative cost of our brain is large,\n\n00:08:39.930 --> 00:08:42.931\nbut just because we're primates,\nnot because we're special.\n\n00:08:42.931 --> 00:08:44.121\nLast question, then:\n\n00:08:44.121 --> 00:08:47.236\nhow did we come by this\nremarkable number of neurons,\n\n00:08:47.236 --> 00:08:49.136\nand in particular, if great apes\n\n00:08:49.136 --> 00:08:50.691\nare larger than we are,\n\n00:08:50.691 --> 00:08:54.456\nwhy don't they have a larger brain \nthan we do, with more neurons?\n\n00:08:54.456 --> 00:08:56.546\nWhen we realized how much expensive it is\n\n00:08:56.546 --> 00:08:58.879\nto have a lot of neurons in the brain, I figured,\n\n00:08:58.879 --> 00:09:00.882\nmaybe there's a simple reason.\n\n00:09:00.882 --> 00:09:02.565\nThey just can't afford the energy\n\n00:09:02.565 --> 00:09:05.515\nfor both a large body \nand a large number of neurons.\n\n00:09:05.515 --> 00:09:06.944\nSo we did the math.\n\n00:09:06.944 --> 00:09:08.544\nWe calculated on the one hand\n\n00:09:08.544 --> 00:09:10.485\nhow much energy a primate gets per day\n\n00:09:10.485 --> 00:09:11.835\nfrom eating raw foods,\n\n00:09:11.835 --> 00:09:13.872\nand on the other hand, how much energy\n\n00:09:13.872 --> 00:09:15.636\na body of a certain size costs\n\n00:09:15.636 --> 00:09:19.023\nand how much energy a brain of a\ncertain number of neurons costs,\n\n00:09:19.023 --> 00:09:20.512\nand we looked for the combinations\n\n00:09:20.512 --> 00:09:22.923\nof body size and number of brain neurons\n\n00:09:22.923 --> 00:09:24.193\nthat a primate could afford\n\n00:09:24.193 --> 00:09:26.741\nif it ate a certain number of hours per day.\n\n00:09:26.741 --> 00:09:28.557\nAnd what we found is that\n\n00:09:28.557 --> 00:09:30.269\nbecause neurons are so expensive,\n\n00:09:30.269 --> 00:09:33.639\nthere is a tradeoff between\nbody size and number of neurons.\n\n00:09:33.639 --> 00:09:36.590\nSo a primate that eats eight hours per day\n\n00:09:36.590 --> 00:09:39.614\ncan afford at most 53 billion neurons,\n\n00:09:39.614 --> 00:09:41.341\nbut then its body cannot be any bigger\n\n00:09:41.341 --> 00:09:43.295\nthan 25 kilos.\n\n00:09:43.295 --> 00:09:44.996\nTo weigh any more than that,\n\n00:09:44.996 --> 00:09:46.765\nit has to give up neurons.\n\n00:09:46.765 --> 00:09:49.418\nSo it's either a large body\n\n00:09:49.418 --> 00:09:50.913\nor a large number of neurons.\n\n00:09:50.913 --> 00:09:52.278\nWhen you eat like a primate,\n\n00:09:52.278 --> 00:09:54.514\nyou can't afford both.\n\n00:09:54.514 --> 00:09:56.478\nOne way out of this metabolic limitation\n\n00:09:56.478 --> 00:09:59.879\nwould be to spend even more hours per day eating,\n\n00:09:59.879 --> 00:10:01.242\nbut that gets dangerous,\n\n00:10:01.242 --> 00:10:03.961\nand past a certain point, it's just not possible.\n\n00:10:03.961 --> 00:10:05.498\nGorillas and orangutans, for instance,\n\n00:10:05.498 --> 00:10:07.421\nafford about 30 billion neurons\n\n00:10:07.421 --> 00:10:10.387\nby spending eight and a half hours per day eating,\n\n00:10:10.387 --> 00:10:13.503\nand that seems to be about as much as they can do.\n\n00:10:13.503 --> 00:10:15.294\nNine hours of feeding per day\n\n00:10:15.294 --> 00:10:18.565\nseems to be the practical limit for a primate.\n\n00:10:18.565 --> 00:10:20.356\nWhat about us?\n\n00:10:20.356 --> 00:10:21.956\nWith our 86 billion neurons\n\n00:10:21.956 --> 00:10:24.991\nand 60 to 70 kilos of body mass,\n\n00:10:24.991 --> 00:10:28.552\nwe should have to spend over nine hours\n\n00:10:28.552 --> 00:10:32.127\nper day every single day feeding,\n\n00:10:32.127 --> 00:10:34.166\nwhich is just not feasible.\n\n00:10:34.166 --> 00:10:36.000\nIf we ate like a primate,\n\n00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:38.253\nwe should not be here.\n\n00:10:38.253 --> 00:10:40.380\nHow did we get here, then?\n\n00:10:40.380 --> 00:10:43.115\nWell, if our brain costs just as much energy\n\n00:10:43.115 --> 00:10:44.838\nas it should, and if we can't spend\n\n00:10:44.838 --> 00:10:48.512\nevery waking hour of the day feeding,\n\n00:10:48.512 --> 00:10:50.423\nthen the only alternative, really,\n\n00:10:50.423 --> 00:10:52.381\nis to somehow get more energy\n\n00:10:52.381 --> 00:10:54.334\nout of the same foods.\n\n00:10:54.334 --> 00:10:58.134\nAnd remarkably, that matches exactly\n\n00:10:58.134 --> 00:11:01.171\nwhat our ancestors are believed to have invented\n\n00:11:01.171 --> 00:11:03.010\none and a half million years ago,\n\n00:11:03.010 --> 00:11:05.792\nwhen they invented cooking.\n\n00:11:05.792 --> 00:11:07.762\nTo cook is to use fire\n\n00:11:07.762 --> 00:11:11.562\nto pre-digest foods outside of your body.\n\n00:11:11.562 --> 00:11:14.168\nCooked foods are softer, so they're easier to chew\n\n00:11:14.168 --> 00:11:16.731\nand to turn completely into mush in your mouth,\n\n00:11:16.731 --> 00:11:18.883\nso that allows them to be completely digested\n\n00:11:18.883 --> 00:11:20.319\nand absorbed in your gut,\n\n00:11:20.319 --> 00:11:23.974\nwhich makes them yield much more\nenergy in much less time.\n\n00:11:23.974 --> 00:11:26.463\nSo cooking frees time for us to do\n\n00:11:26.463 --> 00:11:28.525\nmuch more interesting things with our day\n\n00:11:28.525 --> 00:11:30.005\nand with our neurons\n\n00:11:30.005 --> 00:11:31.910\nthan just thinking about food,\n\n00:11:31.910 --> 00:11:33.614\nlooking for food, and gobbling down food\n\n00:11:33.614 --> 00:11:34.839\nall day long.\n\n00:11:34.839 --> 00:11:37.338\nSo because of cooking, what once was\n\n00:11:37.338 --> 00:11:39.691\na major liability, this large,\n\n00:11:39.691 --> 00:11:42.724\ndangerously expensive brain with a lot of neurons,\n\n00:11:42.724 --> 00:11:44.760\ncould now become a major asset,\n\n00:11:44.760 --> 00:11:48.011\nnow that we could both afford \nthe energy for a lot of neurons\n\n00:11:48.014 --> 00:11:50.517\nand the time to do interesting things with them.\n\n00:11:50.517 --> 00:11:52.491\nSo I think this explains why the human brain\n\n00:11:52.491 --> 00:11:55.731\ngrew to become so large so fast in evolution,\n\n00:11:55.731 --> 00:11:59.628\nall of the while remaining just a primate brain.\n\n00:11:59.628 --> 00:12:02.402\nWith this large brain now affordable by cooking,\n\n00:12:02.402 --> 00:12:05.315\nwe went rapidly from raw foods to culture,\n\n00:12:05.315 --> 00:12:07.921\nagriculture, civilization, grocery stores,\n\n00:12:07.921 --> 00:12:09.546\nelectricity, refrigerators,\n\n00:12:09.546 --> 00:12:11.153\nall of those things that nowadays\n\n00:12:11.153 --> 00:12:13.195\nallow us to get all the energy we need\n\n00:12:13.195 --> 00:12:15.977\nfor the whole day in a single sitting\n\n00:12:15.977 --> 00:12:18.931\nat your favorite fast food joint.\n\n00:12:18.931 --> 00:12:21.368\nSo what once was a solution\n\n00:12:21.368 --> 00:12:23.067\nnow became the problem,\n\n00:12:23.067 --> 00:12:28.584\nand ironically, we look for the solution in raw food.\n\n00:12:28.584 --> 00:12:31.140\nSo what is the human advantage?\n\n00:12:31.140 --> 00:12:32.643\nWhat is it that we have\n\n00:12:32.643 --> 00:12:35.178\nthat no other animal has?\n\n00:12:35.178 --> 00:12:37.526\nMy answer is that we have the largest number\n\n00:12:37.526 --> 00:12:38.998\nof neurons in the cerebral cortex,\n\n00:12:38.998 --> 00:12:40.842\nand I think that's the simplest explanation\n\n00:12:40.842 --> 00:12:42.855\nfor our remarkable cognitive abilities.\n\n00:12:42.855 --> 00:12:46.082\nAnd what is it that we do that no other animal does,\n\n00:12:46.082 --> 00:12:48.051\nand which I believe was fundamental\n\n00:12:48.051 --> 00:12:51.134\nto allow us to reach that large,\n\n00:12:51.134 --> 00:12:53.356\nlargest number of neurons in the cortex?\n\n00:12:53.356 --> 00:12:55.571\nIn two words, we cook.\n\n00:12:55.571 --> 00:12:59.137\nNo other animal cooks its food. Only humans do.\n\n00:12:59.137 --> 00:13:02.007\nAnd I think that's how we got to become human.\n\n00:13:02.007 --> 00:13:04.467\nStudying the human brain changed \nthe way I think about food.\n\n00:13:04.467 --> 00:13:06.112\nI now look at my kitchen,\n\n00:13:06.112 --> 00:13:07.582\nand I bow to it,\n\n00:13:07.582 --> 00:13:09.287\nand I thank my ancestors for coming up\n\n00:13:09.287 --> 00:13:11.187\nwith the invention that probably made us humans.\n\n00:13:11.187 --> 00:13:13.319\nThank you very much.\n\n00:13:13.319 --> 00:13:19.672\n(Applause)"}, {"title": "Want to be happy? Be grateful", "duration": "870", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/david_steindl_rast_want_to_be_happy_be_grateful", "transcript": "There is something you know about me, something very personal, and there is something I know about every one of you and that's very central to your concerns. There is something that we know about everyone we meet anywhere in the world, on the street, that is the very mainspring of whatever they do and whatever they put up with. And that is that all of us want to be happy. In this, we are all together. How we imagine our happiness, that differs from one another, but it's already a lot that we have all in common, that we want to be happy.Now my topic is gratefulness. What is the connection between happiness and gratefulness? Many people would say, well, that's very easy. When you are happy, you are grateful. But think again. Is it really the happy people that are grateful? We all know quite a number of people who have everything that it would take to be happy, and they are not happy, because they want something else or they want more of the same. And we all know people who have lots of misfortune, misfortune that we ourselves would not want to have, and they are deeply happy. They radiate happiness. You are surprised. Why? Because they are grateful. So it is not happiness that makes us grateful. It's gratefulness that makes us happy. If you think it's happiness that makes you grateful, think again. It's gratefulness that makes you happy.Now, we can ask, what do we really mean by gratefulness? And how does it work? I appeal to your own experience. We all know from experience how it goes. We experience something that's valuable to us. Something is given to us that's valuable to us. And it's really given. These two things have to come together. It has to be something valuable, and it's a real gift. You haven't bought it. You haven't earned it. You haven't traded it in. You haven't worked for it. It's just given to you. And when these two things come together, something that's really valuable to me and I realize it's freely given, then gratefulness spontaneously rises in my heart, happiness spontaneously rises in my heart. That's how gratefulness happens.Now the key to all this is that we cannot only experience this once in a while. We cannot only have grateful experiences. We can be people who live gratefully. Grateful living, that is the thing. And how can we live gratefully? By experiencing, by becoming aware that every moment is a given moment, as we say. It's a gift. You haven't earned it. You haven't brought it about in any way. You have no way of assuring that there will be another moment given to you, and yet, that's the most valuable thing that can ever be given to us, this moment, with all the opportunity that it contains. If we didn't have this present moment, we wouldn't have any opportunity to do anything or experience anything, and this moment is a gift. It's a given moment, as we say.Now, we say the gift within this gift is really the opportunity. What you are really grateful for is the opportunity, not the thing that is given to you, because if that thing were somewhere else and you didn't have the opportunity to enjoy it, to do something with it, you wouldn't be grateful for it. Opportunity is the gift within every gift, and we have this saying, opportunity knocks only once. Well, think again. Every moment is a new gift, over and over again, and if you miss the opportunity of this moment, another moment is given to us, and another moment. We can avail ourselves of this opportunity, or we can miss it, and if we avail ourselves of the opportunity, it is the key to happiness. Behold the master key to our happiness in our own hands. Moment by moment, we can be grateful for this gift.Does that mean that we can be grateful for everything? Certainly not. We cannot be grateful for violence, for war, for oppression, for exploitation. On the personal level, we cannot be grateful for the loss of a friend, for unfaithfulness, for bereavement. But I didn't say we can be grateful for everything. I said we can be grateful in every given moment for the opportunity, and even when we are confronted with something that is terribly difficult, we can rise to this occasion and respond to the opportunity that is given to us. It isn't as bad as it might seem. Actually, when you look at it and experience it, you find that most of the time, what is given to us is the opportunity to enjoy, and we only miss it because we are rushing through life and we are not stopping to see the opportunity.But once in a while, something very difficult is given to us, and when this difficult thing occurs to us, it's a challenge to rise to that opportunity, and we can rise to it by learning something which is sometimes painful. Learning patience, for instance. We have been told that the road to peace is not a sprint, but is more like a marathon. That takes patience. That's difficult. It may be to stand up for your opinion, to stand up for your conviction. That's an opportunity that is given to us. To learn, to suffer, to stand up, all these opportunities are given to us, but they are opportunities, and those who avail themselves of those opportunities are the ones that we admire. They make something out of life. And those who fail get another opportunity. We always get another opportunity. That's the wonderful richness of life.So how can we find a method that will harness this? How can each one of us find a method for living gratefully, not just once in a while being grateful, but moment by moment to be grateful. How can we do it? It's a very simple method. It's so simple that it's actually what we were told as children when we learned to cross the street. Stop. Look. Go. That's all. But how often do we stop? We rush through life. We don't stop. We miss the opportunity because we don't stop. We have to stop. We have to get quiet. And we have to build stop signs into our lives.When I was in Africa some years ago and then came back, I noticed water. In Africa where I was, I didn't have drinkable water. Every time I turned on the faucet, I was overwhelmed. Every time I clicked on the light, I was so grateful. It made me so happy. But after a while, this wears off. So I put little stickers on the light switch and on the water faucet, and every time I turned it on, water. So leave it up to your own imagination. You can find whatever works best for you, but you need stop signs in your life. And when you stop, then the next thing is to look. You look. You open your eyes. You open your ears. You open your nose. You open all your senses for this wonderful richness that is given to us. There is no end to it, and that is what life is all about, to enjoy, to enjoy what is given to us.And then we can also open our hearts, our hearts for the opportunities, for the opportunities also to help others, to make others happy, because nothing makes us more happy than when all of us are happy. And when we open our hearts to the opportunities, the opportunities invite us to do something, and that is the third. Stop, look, and then go, and really do something. And what we can do is whatever life offers to you in that present moment. Mostly it's the opportunity to enjoy, but sometimes it's something more difficult.But whatever it is, if we take this opportunity, we go with it, we are creative, those are the creative people. And that little stop, look, go, is such a potent seed that it can revolutionize our world. Because we are at the present moment in the middle of a change of consciousness, and you will be surprised if you \u2014 I am always surprised when I hear how many times this word \"gratefulness\" and \"gratitude\" comes up. Everywhere you find it, a grateful airline, a restaurant gratefulness, a caf\u00e9 gratefulness, a wine that is gratefulness. Yes, I have even come across a toilet paper whose brand is called \"Thank You.\"(Laughter)There is a wave of gratefulness because people are becoming aware how important this is and how this can change our world. It can change our world in immensely important ways, because if you're grateful, you're not fearful, and if you're not fearful, you're not violent. If you're grateful, you act out of a sense of enough and not of a sense of scarcity, and you are willing to share. If you are grateful, you are enjoying the differences between people, and you are respectful to everybody, and that changes this power pyramid under which we live.And it doesn't make for equality, but it makes for equal respect, and that is the important thing. The future of the world will be a network, not a pyramid turned upside down. The revolution of which I am speaking is a nonviolent revolution, and it's so revolutionary that it even revolutionizes the very concept of a revolution, because the normal revolution is one where the power pyramid is turned upside down and those who were on the bottom are now on the top and are doing exactly the same thing that the ones before. What we need is a networking of smaller groups, smaller and smaller groups who know one another, who interact with one another, and that is a grateful world.A grateful world is a world of joyful people. Grateful people are joyful people, and joyful people \u2014 the more and more joyful people there are, the more and more we'll have a joyful world. We have a network for grateful living, and it has mushroomed. We couldn't understand why it mushroomed. We have an opportunity for people to light a candle when they are grateful for something. And there have been 15 million candles lit in one decade. People are becoming aware that a grateful world is a happy world, and we all have the opportunity by the simple stop, look, go, to transform the world, to make it a happy place. And that is what I hope for us, and if this has contributed a little to making you want to do the same, stop, look, go.Thank you.(Applause)", "id": 1880, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:12.454 --> 00:00:16.189\nThere is something you know about me,\n\n00:00:16.213 --> 00:00:20.029\nsomething very personal,\n\n00:00:20.053 --> 00:00:24.484\nand there is something\nI know about every one of you\n\n00:00:24.508 --> 00:00:27.456\nand that's very central to your concerns.\n\n00:00:28.621 --> 00:00:31.202\nThere is something that we know\n\n00:00:31.226 --> 00:00:37.260\nabout everyone we meet\nanywhere in the world, on the street,\n\n00:00:37.284 --> 00:00:42.238\nthat is the very mainspring\nof whatever they do\n\n00:00:42.262 --> 00:00:44.477\nand whatever they put up with.\n\n00:00:46.005 --> 00:00:51.260\nAnd that is that all of us\nwant to be happy.\n\n00:00:52.299 --> 00:00:54.637\nIn this, we are all together.\n\n00:00:55.161 --> 00:01:00.635\nHow we imagine our happiness,\nthat differs from one another,\n\n00:01:00.659 --> 00:01:05.463\nbut it's already a lot\nthat we have all in common,\n\n00:01:05.487 --> 00:01:07.701\nthat we want to be happy.\n\n00:01:09.122 --> 00:01:12.074\nNow my topic is gratefulness.\n\n00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:17.960\nWhat is the connection\nbetween happiness and gratefulness?\n\n00:01:19.268 --> 00:01:22.262\nMany people would say,\nwell, that's very easy.\n\n00:01:22.286 --> 00:01:24.804\nWhen you are happy, you are grateful.\n\n00:01:26.289 --> 00:01:27.799\nBut think again.\n\n00:01:29.646 --> 00:01:33.866\nIs it really the happy people\nthat are grateful?\n\n00:01:35.035 --> 00:01:38.576\nWe all know quite a number of people\n\n00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:42.777\nwho have everything\nthat it would take to be happy,\n\n00:01:42.801 --> 00:01:44.558\nand they are not happy,\n\n00:01:44.582 --> 00:01:48.297\nbecause they want something else\nor they want more of the same.\n\n00:01:50.131 --> 00:01:56.955\nAnd we all know people\nwho have lots of misfortune,\n\n00:01:56.979 --> 00:02:00.756\nmisfortune that we ourselves\nwould not want to have,\n\n00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:02.978\nand they are deeply happy.\n\n00:02:03.532 --> 00:02:06.951\nThey radiate happiness.

social change, not a new therapy or a new intervention or a new way of working with kids or something like that, but a new business model for social change, a new way of tackling the problem.In Britain, 63 percent of all men who come out of short sentences from prison re-offend again within a year. Now how many previous offenses do you think they have on average managed to commit? Forty-three. And how many previous times do you think they've been in prison? Seven.So we went to talk to the Ministry of Justice, and we said to the Ministry of Justice, what's it worth to you if fewer of these guys re-offend? It's got to be worth something, right? I mean, there's prison costs, there's police costs, there's court costs, all these things that you're spending money on to deal with these guys. What's it worth?Now, of course, we care about the social value. Social Finance, the organization I helped set up, cares about social stuff. But we wanted to make the economic case, because if we could make the economic case, then the value of doing this  would be completely compelling. And if we can agree on both a value and a way of measuring whether we've been successful at reducing that re-offending, then we can do something we think rather interesting.The idea is called the social impact bond. Now, the social impact bond is simply saying, if we can get the government to agree, that we can create a contract where they only pay if it worked. So that means that they can try out new stuff without the embarrassment of having to pay if it didn't work, which for still quite a lot of bits of government, that's a serious issue.Now, many of you may have noticed there's a problem at this point, and that is that it takes a long time to measure whether those outcomes have happened. So we have to raise some money. We use the contract to raise money from socially motivated investors. Socially motivated investors: there's an interesting idea, right? But actually, there's a lot of people who, if they're given the chance, would love to invest in something that does social good. And here's the opportunity. Do you want to also help government find whether there's a better economic model, not just leaving these guys to come out of prison and waiting till they re-offend and putting them back in again, but actually working with them to move to a different path to end up with fewer crimes and fewer victims?So we find some investors, and they pay for a set of services, and if those services are successful, then they improve outcomes, and with those measured reductions in re-offending, government saves money, and with those savings, they can pay outcomes. And the investors do not just get their money back, but they make a return.So in March 2010, we signed the first social impact bond with the Ministry of Justice around Peterborough Prison. It was to work with 3,000 offenders split into three cohorts of 1,000 each. Now, each of those cohorts would get measured over the two years that they were coming out of prison. They've got to have a year to commit their crimes, six months to get through the court system, and then they would be compared to a group taken from the police national computer, as similar as possible, and we would get paid providing we achieved a hurdle rate of 10-percent reduction, for every conviction event that didn't happen. So we get paid for crimes saved. Now if we achieved that 10-percent reduction across all three cohorts, then the investors get a seven and a half percent annualized return on their investment, and if we do better than that, they can get up to 13 percent annualized return on their investment, which is okay.So everyone wins here, right? The Ministry of Justice can try out a new program and they only pay if it works. Investors get two opportunities: for the first time, they can invest in social change. Also, they make a reasonable return, and they also know that first investors in these kinds of things, they're going to have to believers. They're going to have to care in the social program, but if this builds a track record over five or 10 years, then you can widen that investor community as more people have confidence in the product. The service providers, well, for the first time, they've got an opportunity to provide services and grow the evidence for what they're doing in a really constructive way and learn and demonstrate the value of what they're doing over five or six years, not just one or two as often happens at the moment. Society wins: fewer crimes, fewer victims. Now, the offenders, they also benefit. Instead of just coming out of the prison with 46 pounds in their pocket, half of them not knowing where they're spending their first night out of jail, actually, someone meets them in prison, learns about their issues, meets them at the gate, takes them through to somewhere to stay, connects them to benefits, connects them to employment, drug rehabilitation, mental health, whatever's needed.So let's think of another example: working with children in care. Social impact bonds work great for any area where there is at the moment very expensive provision that produces poor outcomes for people. So children in the state care tend to do very badly. Only 13 percent achieve a reasonable level of five GCSEs at 16, against 58 percent of the wider population. More troublingly, 27 percent of offenders in prison have spent some time in care. And even more worryingly, and this is a Home Office statistic, 70 percent of prostitutes have spent some time in care. The state is not a great parent. But there are great programs for adolescents who are on the edge of care, and 30 percent of kids going into care are adolescents.So we set up a program with Essex County Council to test out intensive family therapeutic support for those families with adolescents on the edge of the care system. Essex only pays in the event that it's saving them care costs. Investors have put in 3.1 million pounds. That program started last month. Others, around homelessness in London, around youth and employment and education elsewhere in the country. There are now 13 social impact bonds in Britain, and amazing levels of interest in this idea all over the world. So David Cameron's put 20 million pounds into a social outcomes fund to support this idea. Obama has suggested 300 million dollars in the U.S. budget for these kinds of ideas and structures to move it forward, and a lot of other countries are demonstrating considerable interest.So what's caused this excitement? Why is this so different for people? Well, the first piece, which we've talked about, is innovation. It enables testing of new ideas in a way that's less difficult for everybody.The second piece it brings is rigor. By working to outcomes, people really have to test and bring data into the situation that one's dealing with. So taking Peterborough as an example, we add case management across all of the different organizations that we're working with so they know what actually has been done with different prisoners, and at the same time they learn from the Ministry of Justice, and we learn, because we pushed for the data, what actually happens, whether they get re-arrested or not. And we learn and adapt the program accordingly.And this leads to the third element, which is new, and that's flexibility. Because normal contracting for things, when you're spending government money, you're spending our money, tax money, and the people who are in charge  of that are very aware of it so the temptation is to control exactly how you spend it. Now any entrepreneur in the room knows that version 1.0, the business plan, is not the one that generally works. So when you're trying to do something like this, you need the flexibility to adapt the program. And again, in Peterborough, we started off with a program, but we also collected data, and over the period of time, we nuanced and changed that program to add a range of other elements, so that the service adapts and we meet the needs of the long term as well as the short term: greater engagement from the prisoners, longer-term engagement as well.The last element is partnership. There is, at the moment, a stale  debate going on very often: state's better, public sector's better, private sector's better, social sector's better, for a lot of these programs. Actually, for creating social change, we need to bring in the expertise from all of those parties in order to make this work. And this creates a structure through which they can combine.So where does this leave us? This leaves us with a way that people can invest in social change. We've met thousands, possibly millions of people, who want the opportunity to invest in social change. We've met champions all over the public sector keen to make these kinds of differences. With this kind of model, we can help bring them together.Thank you.(Applause)", "id": 1881, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:12.355 --> 00:00:15.915\nI'm here today to talk about social change,\n\n00:00:15.915 --> 00:00:19.198\nnot a new therapy or a new intervention\n\n00:00:19.198 --> 00:00:21.915\nor a new way of working with kids\nor something like that,\n\n00:00:21.915 --> 00:00:24.860\nbut a new business model for social change,\n\n00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:27.767\na new way of tackling the problem.\n\n00:00:27.767 --> 00:00:31.941\nIn Britain, 63 percent of all men\n\n00:00:31.941 --> 00:00:35.004\nwho come out of short sentences from prison\n\n00:00:35.004 --> 00:00:37.525\nre-offend again within a year.\n\n00:00:37.525 --> 00:00:40.143\nNow how many previous offenses\n\n00:00:40.143 --> 00:00:42.526\ndo you think they have on average\n\n00:00:42.526 --> 00:00:45.111\nmanaged to commit?\n\n00:00:45.111 --> 00:00:47.259\nForty-three.\n\n00:00:47.259 --> 00:00:50.922\nAnd how many previous times\ndo you think they've been in prison?\n\n00:00:50.922 --> 00:00:52.109\nSeven.\n\n00:00:52.109 --> 00:00:54.923\nSo we went to talk to the Ministry of Justice,\n\n00:00:54.923 --> 00:00:56.811\nand we said to the Ministry of Justice,\n\n00:00:56.811 --> 00:00:59.163\nwhat's it worth to you\n\n00:00:59.163 --> 00:01:01.340\nif fewer of these guys re-offend?\n\n00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:03.509\nIt's got to be worth something, right?\n\n00:01:03.509 --> 00:01:05.336\nI mean, there's prison costs,\n\n00:01:05.336 --> 00:01:08.864\nthere's police costs, there's court costs,\n\n00:01:08.864 --> 00:01:11.596\nall these things that you're spending money on\n\n00:01:11.596 --> 00:01:14.109\nto deal with these guys.

paid for crimes saved.\n\n00:03:57.976 --> 00:04:02.080\nNow if we achieved that 10-percent reduction\n\n00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:03.765\nacross all three cohorts,\n\n00:04:03.765 --> 00:04:06.905\nthen the investors get a seven and a half percent\n\n00:04:06.905 --> 00:04:09.048\nannualized return on their investment,\n\n00:04:09.048 --> 00:04:10.588\nand if we do better than that,\n\n00:04:10.588

00:04:20.043\nSo everyone wins here, right?\n\n00:04:20.043 --> 00:04:22.758\nThe Ministry of Justice can try out a new program\n\n00:04:22.758 --> 00:04:25.201\nand they only pay if it

of just coming out of the prison\n\n00:05:12.115 --> 00:05:14.039\nwith 46 pounds in their pocket,\n\n00:05:14.039 --> 00:05:15.538\nhalf of them not knowing where they're spending\n\n00:05:15.538 --> 00:05:17.676\ntheir first night out of jail,\n\n00:05:17.676 --> 00:05:20.595\nactually, someone meets them in prison,\n\n00:05:20.595 --> 00:05:22.459\nlearns about their issues,\n\n00:05:22.459 --> 00:05:24.378\nmeets them at the gate,\n\n00:05:24.378 --> 00:05:27.131\ntakes them through to somewhere to stay,\n\n00:05:27.131 --> 00:05:29.549\nconnects them to benefits,\nconnects them to employment,\n\n00:05:29.549 --> 00:05:31.617\ndrug rehabilitation, mental health,\n\n00:05:31.617 --> 00:05:33.347\nwhatever's needed.\n\n00:05:33.347 --> 00:05:36.026\nSo let's think of another example:\n\n00:05:36.026 --> 00:05:37.916\nworking with children in care.\n\n00:05:37.916 --> 00:05:39.540\nSocial impact bonds work great\n\n00:05:39.540 --> 00:05:42.201\nfor any area where there is at the moment\n\n00:05:42.201 --> 00:05:44.600\nvery expensive provision that produces\n\n00:05:44.600 --> 00:05:46.174\npoor outcomes for people.\n\n00:05:46.174 --> 00:05:48.088\nSo children in the state care\n\n00:05:48.088 --> 00:05:50.523\ntend to do very badly.\n\n00:05:50.523 --> 00:05:54.448\nOnly 13 percent achieve a reasonable level\n\n00:05:54.448 --> 00:05:57.347\nof five GCSEs at 16,\n\n00:05:57.347 --> 00:05:59.817\nagainst 58 percent of the wider population.\n\n00:05:59.817 --> 00:06:03.476\nMore troublingly, 27 percent of offenders in prison\n\n00:06:03.476 --> 00:06:05.517\nhave spent some time in care.\n\n00:06:05.517 --> 00:06:06.809\nAnd even more worryingly,\n\n00:06:06.809 --> 00:06:08.781\nand this is a Home Office statistic,\n\n00:06:08.781 --> 00:06:10.681\n70 percent of prostitutes\n\n00:06:10.681 --> 00:06:12.865\nhave spent some time in care.\n\n00:06:12.865 --> 00:06:15.865\nThe state is not a great parent.\n\n00:06:15.865 --> 00:06:18.690\nBut there are great programs\n\n00:06:18.690 --> 00:06:21.702\nfor adolescents who are on the edge of care,\n\n00:06:21.702 --> 00:06:23.578\nand 30 percent of kids going into care\n\n00:06:23.578 --> 00:06:25.237\nare adolescents.\n\n00:06:25.237 --> 00:06:28.077\nSo we set up a program with Essex County Council\n\n00:06:28.077 --> 00:06:31.723\nto test out intensive family therapeutic support\n\n00:06:31.723 --> 00:06:34.763\nfor those families with adolescents\n\n00:06:34.763 --> 00:06:36.334\non the edge of the care system.\n\n00:06:36.334 --> 00:06:39.120\nEssex only pays in the event\n\n00:06:39.120 --> 00:06:41.902\nthat it's saving them care costs.\n\n00:06:41.902 --> 00:06:44.666\nInvestors have put in 3.1 million pounds.\n\n00:06:44.666 --> 00:06:46.924\nThat program started last month.\n\n00:06:46.924 --> 00:06:49.248\nOthers, around homelessness in London,\n\n00:06:49.248 --> 00:06:53.128\naround youth and employment and education\n\n00:06:53.128 --> 00:06:54.495\nelsewhere in the country.\n\n00:06:54.495 --> 00:06:57.850\nThere are now 13 social impact bonds in Britain,\n\n00:06:57.850 --> 00:07:00.325\nand amazing levels of interest in this idea\n\n00:07:00.325 --> 00:07:01.848\nall over the world.\n\n00:07:01.848 --> 00:07:04.563\nSo David Cameron's put 20 million pounds\n\n00:07:04.563 --> 00:07:07.813\ninto a social outcomes fund to support this idea.\n\n00:07:07.813 --> 00:07:10.993\nObama has suggested 300 million dollars\n\n00:07:10.993 --> 00:07:14.526\nin the U.S. budget for these kinds of ideas\n\n00:07:14.526 --> 00:07:16.212\nand structures to move it forward,\n\n00:07:16.212 --> 00:07:17.703\nand a lot of other countries\n\n00:07:17.703 --> 00:07:19.920\nare demonstrating considerable interest.\n\n00:07:19.920 --> 00:07:21.976\nSo what's caused this excitement?\n\n00:07:21.976 --> 00:07:24.495\nWhy is this so different for people?\n\n00:07:24.495 --> 00:07:26.987\nWell, the first piece, which we've talked about,\n\n00:07:26.987 --> 00:07:28.205\nis innovation.\n\n00:07:28.205 --> 00:07:31.403\nIt enables testing of new ideas\n\n00:07:31.403 --> 00:07:34.996\nin a way that's less difficult for everybody.\n\n00:07:34.996 --> 00:07:37.632\nThe second piece it brings is rigor.\n\n00:07:37.632 --> 00:07:40.925\nBy working to outcomes, people really have to test\n\n00:07:40.925 --> 00:07:44.794\nand bring data into the situation\nthat one's dealing with.\n\n00:07:44.803 --> 00:07:47.296\nSo taking Peterborough as an example,\n\n00:07:47.296 --> 00:07:49.519\nwe add case management\n\n00:07:49.519 --> 00:07:52.175\nacross all of the different organizations\nthat we're working with\n\n00:07:52.175 --> 00:07:53.460\nso they know\n\n00:07:53.460 --> 00:07:55.609\nwhat actually has been done with different prisoners,\n\n00:07:55.609 --> 00:07:57.678\nand at the same time they learn\n\n00:07:57.678 --> 00:08:00.104\nfrom the Ministry of Justice, and we learn,\n\n00:08:00.104 --> 00:08:01.839\nbecause we pushed for the data,\n\n00:08:01.839 --> 00:08:04.046\nwhat actually happens, whether\nthey get re-arrested or not.\n\n00:08:04.046 --> 00:08:07.334\nAnd we learn and adapt the program accordingly.\n\n00:08:07.334 --> 00:08:10.271\nAnd this leads to the third element, which is new,\n\n00:08:10.271 --> 00:08:12.373\nand that's flexibility.\n\n00:08:12.373 --> 00:08:15.486\nBecause normal contracting for things,\n\n00:08:15.486 --> 00:08:17.547\nwhen you're spending government money,\n\n00:08:17.547 --> 00:08:20.058\nyou're spending our money, tax money,\n\n00:08:20.058 --> 00:08:22.755\nand the people who are in charge \nof that are very aware of it\n\n00:08:22.755 --> 00:08:26.605\nso the temptation is to control\nexactly how you spend it.\n\n00:08:26.605 --> 00:08:29.658\nNow any entrepreneur in the room knows\n\n00:08:29.658 --> 00:08:31.755\nthat version 1.0, the business plan,\n\n00:08:31.755 --> 00:08:34.602\nis not the one that generally works.\n\n00:08:34.602 --> 00:08:36.905\nSo when you're trying to do something like this,\n\n00:08:36.905 --> 00:08:39.598\nyou need the flexibility to adapt the program.\n\n00:08:39.598 --> 00:08:42.310\nAnd again, in Peterborough, we started off\n\n00:08:42.310 --> 00:08:46.467\nwith a program, but we also collected data,\n\n00:08:46.467 --> 00:08:48.344\nand over the period of time,\n\n00:08:48.344 --> 00:08:50.542\nwe nuanced and changed that program\n\n00:08:50.542 --> 00:08:53.162\nto add a range of other elements,\n\n00:08:53.162 --> 00:08:54.927\nso that the service adapts\n\n00:08:54.927 --> 00:08:57.428\nand we meet the needs of the long term\n\n00:08:57.428 --> 00:08:59.492\nas well as the short term:\n\n00:08:59.492 --> 00:09:02.601\ngreater engagement from the prisoners,\n\n00:09:02.601 --> 00:09:05.380\nlonger-term engagement as well.\n\n00:09:05.380 --> 00:09:07.916\nThe last element is partnership.\n\n00:09:07.916 --> 00:09:11.093\nThere is, at the moment, a stale \ndebate going on very often:\n\n00:09:11.093 --> 00:09:13.218\nstate's better, public sector's better,\n\n00:09:13.218 --> 00:09:16.729\nprivate sector's better, social sector's better,\n\n00:09:16.729 --> 00:09:18.397\nfor a lot of these programs.\n\n00:09:18.397 --> 00:09:20.379\nActually, for creating social change,\n\n00:09:20.379 --> 00:09:22.118\nwe need to bring in the expertise\n\n00:09:22.118 --> 00:09:23.814\nfrom all of those parties\n\n00:09:23.814 --> 00:09:25.402\nin order to make this work.\n\n00:09:25.402 --> 00:09:27.445\nAnd this creates a structure\n\n00:09:27.445 --> 00:09:29.420\nthrough which they can combine.\n\n00:09:29.420 --> 00:09:31.352\nSo where does this leave us?\n\n00:09:31.352 --> 00:09:33.186\nThis leaves us with a way\n\n00:09:33.186 --> 00:09:36.173\nthat people can invest in social change.\n\n00:09:36.173 --> 00:09:39.160\nWe've met thousands, possibly millions of people,\n\n00:09:39.160 --> 00:09:41.593\nwho want the opportunity to invest in social change.\n\n00:09:41.593 --> 00:09:44.682\nWe've met champions all over the public sector\n\n00:09:44.682 --> 00:09:47.097\nkeen to make these kinds of differences.\n\n00:09:47.097 --> 00:09:48.882\nWith this kind of model,\n\n00:09:48.882 --> 00:09:50.818\nwe can help bring them together.\n\n00:09:50.818 --> 00:09:52.780\nThank you.\n\n00:09:52.780 --> 00:09:56.980\n(Applause)"}, {"title": "Body parts on a chip", "duration": "803", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/geraldine_hamilton_body_parts_on_a_chip", "transcript": "We have a global health challenge in our hands today, and that is that the way we currently discover and develop new drugs is too costly, takes far too long, and it fails more often than it succeeds. It really just isn't working, and that means that patients that badly need new therapies are not getting them, and diseases are going untreated. We seem to be spending more and more money. So for every billion dollars we spend in R&D, we're getting less drugs approved into the market. More money, less drugs. Hmm.So what's going on here? Well, there's a multitude of factors at play, but I think one of the key factors is that the tools that we currently have available to test whether a drug is going to work, whether it has efficacy, or whether it's going to be safe before we get it into human clinical trials, are failing us. They're not predicting what's going to happen in humans. And we have two main tools available at our disposal. They are cells in dishes and animal testing.Now let's talk about the first one, cells in dishes. So, cells are happily functioning in our bodies. We take them and rip them out of their native environment, throw them in one of these dishes, and expect them to work. Guess what. They don't. They don't like that environment because it's nothing like what they have in the body.What about animal testing? Well, animals do and can provide extremely useful information. They teach us about what happens in the complex organism. We learn more about the biology itself. However, more often than not, animal models fail to predict what will happen in humans when they're treated with a particular drug.So we need better tools. We need human cells, but we need to find a way to keep them happy outside the body.Our bodies are dynamic environments. We're in constant motion. Our cells experience that. They're in dynamic environments in our body. They're under constant mechanical forces. So if we want to make cells happy outside our bodies, we need to become cell architects. We need to design, build and engineer a home away from home for the cells.And at the Wyss Institute, we've done just that. We call it an organ-on-a-chip. And I have one right here. It's beautiful, isn't it? But it's pretty incredible. Right here in my hand is a breathing, living human lung on a chip.And it's not just beautiful. It can do a tremendous amount of things. We have living cells in that little chip, cells that are in a dynamic environment interacting with different cell types. There's been many people trying to grow cells in the lab. They've tried many different approaches. They've even tried to grow little mini-organs in the lab. We're not trying to do that here. We're simply trying to recreate in this tiny chip the smallest functional unit that represents the biochemistry, the function and the mechanical strain that the cells experience in our bodies. So how does it work? Let me show you. We use techniques from the computer chip manufacturing industry to make these structures at a scale relevant to both the cells and their environment. We have three fluidic channels. In the center, we have a porous, flexible membrane on which we can add human cells from, say, our lungs, and then underneath, they had capillary cells, the cells in our blood vessels. And we can then apply mechanical forces to the chip that stretch and contract the membrane, so the cells experience the same mechanical forces that they did when we breathe. And they experience them how they did in the body. There's air flowing through the top channel, and then we flow a liquid that contains nutrients through the blood channel. Now the chip is really beautiful, but what can we do with it? We can get incredible functionality inside these little chips. Let me show you. We could, for example, mimic infection, where we add bacterial cells into the lung. then we can add human white blood cells. White blood cells are our body's defense against bacterial invaders, and when they sense this inflammation due to infection, they will enter from the blood into the lung and engulf the bacteria. Well now you're going to see this happening live in an actual human lung on a chip. We've labeled the white blood cells so you can see them flowing through, and when they detect that infection, they begin to stick. They stick, and then they try to go into the lung side from blood channel. And you can see here, we can actually visualize a single white blood cell. It sticks, it wiggles its way through between the cell layers, through the pore, comes out on the other side of the membrane, and right there, it's going to engulf the bacteria labeled in green. In that tiny chip, you just witnessed one of the most fundamental responses our body has to an infection. It's the way we respond to \u2014 an immune response. It's pretty exciting.Now I want to share this picture with you, not just because it's so beautiful, but because it tells us an enormous amount of information about what the cells are doing within the chips. It tells us that these cells from the small airways in our lungs, actually have these hairlike structures that you would expect to see in the lung. These structures are called cilia, and they actually move the mucus out of the lung. Yeah. Mucus. Yuck. But mucus is actually very important. Mucus traps particulates, viruses, potential allergens, and these little cilia move and clear the mucus out. When they get damaged, say, by cigarette smoke for example, they don't work properly, and they can't clear that mucus out. And that can lead to diseases such as bronchitis. Cilia and the clearance of mucus are also involved in awful diseases like cystic fibrosis. But now, with the functionality that we get in these chips, we can begin to look for potential new treatments.We didn't stop with the lung on a chip. We have a gut on a chip. You can see one right here. And we've put intestinal human cells in a gut on a chip, and they're under constant peristaltic motion, this trickling flow through the cells, and we can mimic many of the functions that you actually would expect to see in the human intestine. Now we can begin to create models of diseases such as irritable bowel syndrome. This is a disease that affects a large number of individuals. It's really debilitating, and there aren't really many good treatments for it.Now we have a whole pipeline of different organ chips that we are currently working on in our labs. Now, the true power of this technology, however, really comes from the fact that we can fluidically link them. There's fluid flowing across these cells, so we can begin to interconnect multiple different chips together to form what we call a virtual human on a chip. Now we're really getting excited. We're not going to ever recreate  a whole human in these chips, but what our goal is is to be able to recreate sufficient functionality so that we can make better predictions of what's going to happen in humans. For example, now we can begin to explore what happens when we put a drug like an aerosol drug. Those of you like me who have asthma, when you take your inhaler, we can explore how that drug comes into your lungs, how it enters the body, how it might affect, say, your heart. Does it change the beating of your heart? Does it have a toxicity? Does it get cleared by the liver? Is it metabolized in the liver? Is it excreted in your kidneys? We can begin to study the dynamic response of the body to a drug.This could really revolutionize and be a game changer for not only the pharmaceutical industry, but a whole host of different industries, including the cosmetics industry. We can potentially use the skin on a chip that we're currently developing in the lab to test whether the ingredients in those products that you're using are actually  safe to put on your skin without the need for animal testing. We could test the safety of chemicals that we are exposed to on a daily basis in our environment, such as chemicals in regular household cleaners. We could also use the organs on chips for applications in bioterrorism or radiation exposure. We could use them to learn more about diseases such as ebola or other deadly diseases such as SARS.Organs on chips could also change the way we do clinical trials in the future. Right now, the average participant in a clinical trial is that: average. Tends to be middle aged, tends to be female. You won't find many clinical trials in which children are involved, yet every day, we give children medications, and the only safety data we have on that drug is one that we obtained from adults. Children are not adults. They may not respond in the same way adults do. There are other things like genetic differences in populations that may lead to at-risk populations that are at risk of having an adverse drug reaction. Now imagine if we could take cells from all those different populations, put them on chips, and create populations on a chip. This could really change the way we do clinical trials. And this is the team and the people that are doing this. We have engineers, we have cell biologists, we have clinicians, all working together. We're really seeing something quite incredible at the Wyss Institute. It's really a convergence of disciplines, where biology is influencing the way we design, the way we engineer, the way we build. It's pretty exciting.We're establishing important industry collaborations such as the one we have with a company that has expertise in large-scale digital manufacturing. They're going to help us make, instead of one of these, millions of these chips, so that we can get them into the hands of as many researchers as possible. And this is key to the potential of that technology.Now let me show you our instrument. This is an instrument that our engineers are actually prototyping right now in the lab, and this instrument is going to give us the engineering controls that we're going to require in order to link 10 or more organ chips together. It does something else that's very important. It creates an easy user interface. So a cell biologist like me can come in, take a chip, put it in a cartridge like the prototype you see there, put the cartridge into the machine just like you would a C.D., and away you go. Plug and play. Easy.Now, let's imagine a little bit what the future might look like if I could take your stem cells and put them on a chip, or your stem cells and put them on a chip. It would be a personalized chip just for you.Now all of us in here are individuals, and those individual differences mean that we could react very differently and sometimes in unpredictable ways to drugs. I myself, a couple of years back, had a really bad headache, just couldn't shake it, thought,  \"Well, I'll try something different.\" I took some Advil. Fifteen minutes later, I was on my way to the emergency room with a full-blown asthma attack. Now, obviously it wasn't fatal, but unfortunately, some of these adverse drug reactions can be fatal.So how do we prevent them? Well, we could imagine one day having Geraldine on a chip, having Danielle on a chip, having you on a chip.Personalized medicine.

Hmm.\n\n00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:57.810\nSo what's going on here?\n\n00:00:57.810 --> 00:01:00.405\nWell, there's a multitude of factors at play,\n\n00:01:00.405 --> 00:01:02.426\nbut I think one of the key factors\n\n00:01:02.426 --> 00:01:04.823\nis that the tools that we currently have\n\n00:01:04.823 --> 00:01:08.906\navailable to test whether a drug is going to work,\n\n00:01:08.906 --> 00:01:10.295\nwhether it has efficacy,\n\n00:01:10.295 --> 00:01:12.061\nor whether it's going to be safe\n\n00:01:12.061 --> 00:01:15.613\nbefore we get it into human clinical trials,\n\n00:01:15.613 --> 00:01:17.764\nare failing us. They're not predicting\n\n00:01:17.764 --> 00:01:20.992\nwhat's going to happen in humans.\n\n00:01:20.992 --> 00:01:23.715\nAnd we have two main tools available\n\n00:01:23.715 --> 00:01:25.729\nat our disposal.\n\n00:01:25.729 --> 00:01:29.770\nThey are cells in dishes and animal testing.\n\n00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:33.090\nNow let's talk about the first one, cells in dishes.\n\n00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:36.243\nSo, cells are happily functioning in our bodies.\n\n00:01:36.243 --> 00:01:38.298\nWe take them and rip them out\n\n00:01:38.298 --> 00:01:41.247\nof their native environment,\nthrow them in one of these dishes,\n\n00:01:41.247 --> 00:01:42.832\nand expect them to work.\n\n00:01:42.832 --> 00:01:45.025\nGuess what. They don't.\n\n00:01:45.025 --> 00:01:46.687\nThey don't like that environment\n\n00:01:46.687 --> 00:01:48.319\nbecause it's nothing like\n\n00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:50.995\nwhat they have in the body.\n\n00:01:50.995 --> 00:01:53.066\nWhat about animal testing?\n\n00:01:53.066 --> 00:01:55.951\nWell, animals do and can provide\n\n00:01:55.951 --> 00:01:58.213\nextremely useful information.\n\n00:01:58.213 --> 00:01:59.922\nThey teach us about what happens\n\n00:01:59.922 --> 00:02:02.251\nin the complex organism.\n\n00:02:02.251 --> 00:02:05.259\nWe learn more about the biology itself.\n\n00:02:05.259 --> 00:02:08.157\nHowever, more often than not,\n\n00:02:08.157 --> 00:02:12.373\nanimal models fail to predict\nwhat will happen in humans\n\n00:02:12.373 --> 00:02:15.559\nwhen they're treated with a particular drug.\n\n00:02:15.559 --> 00:02:17.938\nSo we need better tools.\n\n00:02:17.938 --> 00:02:19.691\nWe need human cells,\n\n00:02:19.691 --> 00:02:22.441\nbut we need to find a way to keep them happy\n\n00:02:22.441 --> 00:02:24.032\noutside the body.\n\n00:02:24.032 --> 00:02:26.938\nOur bodies are dynamic environments.\n\n00:02:26.938 --> 00:02:28.778\nWe're in constant motion.\n\n00:02:28.778 --> 00:02:30.969\nOur cells experience that.\n\n00:02:30.969 --> 00:02:33.778\nThey're in dynamic environments in our body.\n\n00:02:33.778 --> 00:02:36.533\nThey're under constant mechanical forces.\n\n00:02:36.533 --> 00:02:38.989\nSo if we want to make cells happy\n\n00:02:38.989 --> 00:02:40.418\noutside our bodies,\n\n00:02:40.418 --> 00:02:42.944\nwe need to become cell architects.\n\n00:02:42.944 --> 00:02:47.288\nWe need to design, build and engineer\n\n00:02:47.288 --> 00:02:50.519\na home away from home for the cells.\n\n00:02:50.519 --> 00:02:52.193\nAnd at the Wyss Institute,\n\n00:02:52.193 --> 00:02:54.131\nwe've done just that.\n\n00:02:54.131 --> 00:02:57.155\nWe call it an organ-on-a-chip.\n\n00:02:57.155 --> 00:02:58.946\nAnd I have one right here.\n\n00:02:58.946 --> 00:03:01.761\nIt's beautiful, isn't it?\nBut it's pretty incredible.\n\n00:03:01.761 --> 00:03:06.261\nRight here in my hand is a breathing, living\n\n00:03:06.261 --> 00:03:08.919\nhuman lung on a chip.\n\n00:03:08.919 --> 00:03:11.047\nAnd it's not just beautiful.\n\n00:03:11.047 --> 00:03:13.487\nIt can do a tremendous amount of things.\n\n00:03:13.487 --> 00:03:17.266\nWe have living cells in that little chip,\n\n00:03:17.266 --> 00:03:19.816\ncells that are in a dynamic environment\n\n00:03:19.816 --> 00:03:22.897\ninteracting with different cell types.\n\n00:03:22.897 --> 00:03:24.536\nThere's been many people\n\n00:03:24.536 --> 00:03:26.397\ntrying to grow cells in the lab.\n\n00:03:26.397 --> 00:03:29.553\nThey've tried many different approaches.\n\n00:03:29.553 --> 00:03:32.180\nThey've even tried to grow\nlittle mini-organs in the lab.\n\n00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:33.729\nWe're not trying to do that here.\n\n00:03:33.729 --> 00:03:35.855\nWe're simply trying to recreate\n\n00:03:35.855 --> 00:03:37.432\nin this tiny chip\n\n00:03:37.432 --> 00:03:40.449\nthe smallest functional unit\n\n00:03:40.449 --> 00:03:43.003\nthat represents the biochemistry,\n\n00:03:43.003 --> 00:03:46.127\nthe function and the mechanical strain\n\n00:03:46.127 --> 00:03:49.643\nthat the cells experience in our bodies.\n\n00:03:49.643 --> 00:03:52.675\nSo how does it work? Let me show you.\n\n00:03:52.675 --> 00:03:55.309\nWe use techniques from the computer chip\n\n00:03:55.309 --> 00:03:56.942\nmanufacturing industry\n\n00:03:56.942 --> 00:03:59.139\nto make these structures at a scale\n\n00:03:59.139 --> 00:04:02.035\nrelevant to both the cells and their environment.\n\n00:04:02.035 --> 00:04:04.099\nWe have three fluidic channels.\n\n00:04:04.099 --> 00:04:07.811\nIn the center, we have a porous, flexible membrane\n\n00:04:07.811 --> 00:04:09.874\non which we can add human cells\n\n00:04:09.874 --> 00:04:11.218\nfrom, say, our lungs,\n\n00:04:11.218 --> 00:04:13.705\nand then underneath, they had capillary cells,\n\n00:04:13.705 --> 00:04:15.493\nthe cells in our blood vessels.\n\n00:04:15.493 --> 00:04:19.813\nAnd we can then apply mechanical forces to the chip\n\n00:04:19.813 --> 00:04:22.642\nthat stretch and contract the membrane,\n\n00:04:22.642 --> 00:04:25.739\nso the cells experience the same mechanical forces\n\n00:04:25.739 --> 00:04:28.672\nthat they did when we breathe.\n\n00:04:28.672 --> 00:04:31.832\nAnd they experience them how they did in the body.\n\n00:04:31.832 --> 00:04:34.232\nThere's air flowing through the top channel,\n\n00:04:34.232 --> 00:04:37.581\nand then we flow a liquid that contains nutrients\n\n00:04:37.581 --> 00:04:40.420\nthrough the blood channel.\n\n00:04:40.420 --> 00:04:42.792\nNow the chip is really beautiful,\n\n00:04:42.792 --> 00:04:44.889\nbut what can we do with it?\n\n00:04:44.889 --> 00:04:47.213\nWe can get incredible functionality\n\n00:04:47.213 --> 00:04:48.964\ninside these little chips.\n\n00:04:48.964 --> 00:04:50.470\nLet me show you.\n\n00:04:50.470 --> 00:04:53.101\nWe could, for example, mimic infection,\n\n00:04:53.101 --> 00:04:56.637\nwhere we add bacterial cells into the lung.\n\n00:04:56.637 --> 00:04:59.569\nthen we can add human white blood cells.\n\n00:04:59.569 --> 00:05:02.160\nWhite blood cells are our body's defense\n\n00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:03.528\nagainst bacterial invaders,\n\n00:05:03.528 --> 00:05:06.697\nand when they sense this\ninflammation due to infection,\n\n00:05:06.697 --> 00:05:09.554\nthey will enter from the blood into the lung\n\n00:05:09.554 --> 00:05:11.469\nand engulf the bacteria.\n\n00:05:11.469 --> 00:05:13.717\nWell now you're going to see this happening\n\n00:05:13.717 --> 00:05:17.027\nlive in an actual human lung on a chip.\n\n00:05:17.027 --> 00:05:20.570\nWe've labeled the white blood cells\nso you can see them flowing through,\n\n00:05:20.570 --> 00:05:22.731\nand when they detect that infection,\n\n00:05:22.731 --> 00:05:24.128\nthey begin to stick.\n\n00:05:24.128 --> 00:05:28.015\nThey stick, and then they try to go into the lung\n\n00:05:28.015 --> 00:05:29.796\nside from blood channel.\n\n00:05:29.796 --> 00:05:33.485\nAnd you can see here, we can actually visualize\n\n00:05:33.485 --> 00:05:37.244\na single white blood cell.\n\n00:05:37.244 --> 00:05:39.500\nIt sticks, it wiggles its way through\n\n00:05:39.500 --> 00:05:41.815\nbetween the cell layers, through the pore,\n\n00:05:41.815 --> 00:05:44.236\ncomes out on the other side of the membrane,\n\n00:05:44.236 --> 00:05:47.671\nand right there, it's going to engulf the bacteria\n\n00:05:47.671 --> 00:05:49.320\nlabeled in green.\n\n00:05:49.320 --> 00:05:52.324\nIn that tiny chip, you just witnessed\n\n00:05:52.324 --> 00:05:55.505\none of the most fundamental responses\n\n00:05:55.505 --> 00:05:57.462\nour body has to an infection.\n\n00:05:57.462 --> 00:06:01.232\nIt's the way we respond to -- an immune response.\n\n00:06:01.232 --> 00:06:03.633\nIt's pretty exciting.\n\n00:06:03.633 --> 00:06:05.976\nNow I want to share this picture with you,\n\n00:06:05.976 --> 00:06:08.614\nnot just because it's so beautiful,\n\n00:06:08.614 --> 00:06:11.950\nbut because it tells us an enormous\namount of information\n\n00:06:11.950 --> 00:06:14.547\nabout what the cells are doing within the chips.\n\n00:06:14.547 --> 00:06:16.806\nIt tells us that these cells\n\n00:06:16.806 --> 00:06:19.117\nfrom the small airways in our lungs,\n\n00:06:19.117 --> 00:06:20.868\nactually have these hairlike structures\n\n00:06:20.868 --> 00:06:22.876\nthat you would expect to see in the lung.\n\n00:06:22.876 --> 00:06:24.341\nThese structures are called cilia,\n\n00:06:24.341 --> 00:06:27.251\nand they actually move the mucus out of the lung.\n\n00:06:27.251 --> 00:06:28.790\nYeah. Mucus. Yuck.\n\n00:06:28.790 --> 00:06:31.230\nBut mucus is actually very important.\n\n00:06:31.230 --> 00:06:33.811\nMucus traps particulates, viruses,\n\n00:06:33.811 --> 00:06:35.270\npotential allergens,\n\n00:06:35.270 --> 00:06:36.871\nand these little cilia move\n\n00:06:36.871 --> 00:06:39.121\nand clear the mucus out.\n\n00:06:39.121 --> 00:06:41.033\nWhen they get damaged, say,\n\n00:06:41.033 --> 00:06:43.452\nby cigarette smoke for example,\n\n00:06:43.452 --> 00:06:46.260\nthey don't work properly,\nand they can't clear that mucus out.\n\n00:06:46.260 --> 00:06:50.077\nAnd that can lead to diseases such as bronchitis.\n\n00:06:50.077 --> 00:06:52.724\nCilia and the clearance of mucus\n\n00:06:52.724 --> 00:06:57.185\nare also involved in awful diseases like cystic fibrosis.\n\n00:06:57.185 --> 00:07:00.735\nBut now, with the functionality\nthat we get in these chips,\n\n00:07:00.735 --> 00:07:02.559\nwe can begin to look\n\n00:07:02.559 --> 00:07:05.072\nfor potential new treatments.\n\n00:07:05.072 --> 00:07:07.024\nWe didn't stop with the lung on a chip.\n\n00:07:07.024 --> 00:07:08.908\nWe have a gut on a chip.\n\n00:07:08.908 --> 00:07:10.938\nYou can see one right here.\n\n00:07:10.938 --> 00:07:14.164\nAnd we've put intestinal human cells\n\n00:07:14.164 --> 00:07:16.069\nin a gut on a chip,\n\n00:07:16.069 --> 00:07:18.906\nand they're under constant peristaltic motion,\n\n00:07:18.906 --> 00:07:22.097\nthis trickling flow through the cells,\n\n00:07:22.097 --> 00:07:24.655\nand we can mimic many of the functions\n\n00:07:24.655 --> 00:07:26.918\nthat you actually would expect to see\n\n00:07:26.918 --> 00:07:28.611\nin the human intestine.\n\n00:07:28.611 --> 00:07:32.402\nNow we can begin to create models of diseases\n\n00:07:32.402 --> 00:07:34.812\nsuch as irritable bowel syndrome.\n\n00:07:34.812 --> 00:07:36.894\nThis is a disease that affects\n\n00:07:36.894 --> 00:07:38.805\na large number of individuals.\n\n00:07:38.805 --> 00:07:40.579\nIt's really debilitating,\n\n00:07:40.579 --> 00:07:44.521\nand there aren't really many good treatments for it.\n\n00:07:44.521 --> 00:07:46.823\nNow we have a whole pipeline\n\n00:07:46.823 --> 00:07:49.102\nof different organ chips\n\n00:07:49.102 --> 00:07:52.834\nthat we are currently working on in our labs.\n\n00:07:52.834 --> 00:07:56.253\nNow, the true power of this technology, however,\n\n00:07:56.253 --> 00:07:58.378\nreally comes from the fact\n\n00:07:58.378 --> 00:08:00.923\nthat we can fluidically link them.\n\n00:08:00.923 --> 00:08:02.870\nThere's fluid flowing across these cells,\n\n00:08:02.870 --> 00:08:04.949\nso we can begin to interconnect\n\n00:08:04.949 --> 00:08:07.811\nmultiple different chips together\n\n00:08:07.811 --> 00:08:12.024\nto form what we call a virtual human on a chip.\n\n00:08:12.024 --> 00:08:15.033\nNow we're really getting excited.\n\n00:08:15.033 --> 00:08:19.128\nWe're not going to ever recreate \na whole human in these chips,\n\n00:08:19.128 --> 00:08:23.297\nbut what our goal is is to be able to recreate\n\n00:08:23.297 --> 00:08:25.310\nsufficient functionality\n\n00:08:25.310 --> 00:08:27.670\nso that we can make better predictions\n\n00:08:27.670 --> 00:08:29.884\nof what's going to happen in humans.\n\n00:08:29.884 --> 00:08:32.808\nFor example, now we can begin to explore\n\n00:08:32.808 --> 00:08:36.242\nwhat happens when we put\na drug like an aerosol drug.\n\n00:08:36.242 --> 00:08:39.228\nThose of you like me who have asthma,\nwhen you take your inhaler,\n\n00:08:39.228 --> 00:08:42.154\nwe can explore how that drug comes into your lungs,\n\n00:08:42.154 --> 00:08:43.780\nhow it enters the body,\n\n00:08:43.780 --> 00:08:45.534\nhow it might affect, say, your heart.\n\n00:08:45.534 --> 00:08:47.442\nDoes it change the beating of your heart?\n\n00:08:47.442 --> 00:08:49.083\nDoes it have a toxicity?\n\n00:08:49.083 --> 00:08:51.091\nDoes it get cleared by the liver?\n\n00:08:51.091 --> 00:08:53.243\nIs it metabolized in the liver?\n\n00:08:53.243 --> 00:08:55.134\nIs it excreted in your kidneys?\n\n00:08:55.134 --> 00:08:57.346\nWe can begin to study the dynamic\n\n00:08:57.346 --> 00:08:59.971\nresponse of the body to a drug.\n\n00:08:59.986 --> 00:09:01.905\nThis could really revolutionize\n\n00:09:01.905 --> 00:09:03.554\nand be a game changer\n\n00:09:03.554 --> 00:09:06.492\nfor not only the pharmaceutical industry,\n\n00:09:06.492 --> 00:09:08.865\nbut a whole host of different industries,\n\n00:09:08.865 --> 00:09:11.265\nincluding the cosmetics industry.\n\n00:09:11.265 --> 00:09:14.147\nWe can potentially use the skin on a chip\n\n00:09:14.147 --> 00:09:16.108\nthat we're currently developing in the lab\n\n00:09:16.108 --> 00:09:18.662\nto test whether the ingredients in those products\n\n00:09:18.662 --> 00:09:21.945\nthat you're using are actually \nsafe to put on your skin\n\n00:09:21.945 --> 00:09:24.634\nwithout the need for animal testing.\n\n00:09:24.634 --> 00:09:26.578\nWe could test the safety\n\n00:09:26.578 --> 00:09:28.831\nof chemicals that we are exposed to\n\n00:09:28.831 --> 00:09:30.745\non a daily basis in our environment,\n\n00:09:30.745 --> 00:09:34.476\nsuch as chemicals in regular household cleaners.\n\n00:09:34.476 --> 00:09:37.678\nWe could also use the organs on chips\n\n00:09:37.678 --> 00:09:40.457\nfor applications in bioterrorism\n\n00:09:40.457 --> 00:09:43.028\nor radiation exposure.\n\n00:09:43.028 --> 00:09:46.378\nWe could use them to learn more about\n\n00:09:46.378 --> 00:09:49.422\ndiseases such as ebola\n\n00:09:49.422 --> 00:09:53.314\nor other deadly diseases such as SARS.\n\n00:09:53.314 --> 00:09:55.152\nOrgans on chips could also change\n\n00:09:55.152 --> 00:09:58.526\nthe way we do clinical trials in the future.\n\n00:09:58.526 --> 00:10:01.113\nRight now, the average participant\n\n00:10:01.113 --> 00:10:04.483\nin a clinical trial is that: average.\n\n00:10:04.483 --> 00:10:07.809\nTends to be middle aged, tends to be female.\n\n00:10:07.809 --> 00:10:10.281\nYou won't find many clinical trials\n\n00:10:10.281 --> 00:10:11.796\nin which children are involved,\n\n00:10:11.796 --> 00:10:15.343\nyet every day, we give children medications,\n\n00:10:15.343 --> 00:10:19.089\nand the only safety data we have on that drug\n\n00:10:19.089 --> 00:10:22.163\nis one that we obtained from adults.\n\n00:10:22.163 --> 00:10:23.957\nChildren are not adults.\n\n00:10:23.957 --> 00:10:27.090\nThey may not respond in the same way adults do.\n\n00:10:27.090 --> 00:10:29.502\nThere are other things like genetic differences\n\n00:10:29.502 --> 00:10:30.935\nin populations\n\n00:10:30.935 --> 00:10:34.041\nthat may lead to at-risk populations\n\n00:10:34.041 --> 00:10:37.478\nthat are at risk of having an adverse drug reaction.\n\n00:10:37.478 --> 00:10:40.867\nNow imagine if we could take cells\nfrom all those different populations,\n\n00:10:40.877 --> 00:10:42.785\nput them on chips,\n\n00:10:42.785 --> 00:10:44.749\nand create populations on a chip.\n\n00:10:44.749 --> 00:10:46.587\nThis could really change the way\n\n00:10:46.587 --> 00:10:48.656\nwe do clinical trials.\n\n00:10:48.656 --> 00:10:51.488\nAnd this is the team and the people\nthat are doing this.\n\n00:10:51.488 --> 00:10:54.745\nWe have engineers, we have cell biologists,\n\n00:10:54.745 --> 00:10:58.519\nwe have clinicians, all working together.\n\n00:10:58.519 --> 00:11:00.445\nWe're really seeing something quite incredible\n\n00:11:00.445 --> 00:11:02.050\nat the Wyss Institute.\n\n00:11:02.050 --> 00:11:04.221\nIt's really a convergence of disciplines,\n\n00:11:04.221 --> 00:11:07.941\nwhere biology is influencing the way we design,\n\n00:11:07.941 --> 00:11:10.603\nthe way we engineer, the way we build.\n\n00:11:10.603 --> 00:11:12.006\nIt's pretty exciting.\n\n00:11:12.006 --> 00:11:15.570\nWe're establishing important industry collaborations\n\n00:11:15.570 --> 00:11:18.943\nsuch as the one we have with a company\n\n00:11:18.943 --> 00:11:22.542\nthat has expertise in large-scale\ndigital manufacturing.\n\n00:11:22.542 --> 00:11:24.561\nThey're going to help us make,\n\n00:11:24.561 --> 00:11:26.087\ninstead of one of these,\n\n00:11:26.087 --> 00:11:27.670\nmillions of these chips,\n\n00:11:27.670 --> 00:11:29.339\nso that we can get them into the hands\n\n00:11:29.339 --> 00:11:32.228\nof as many researchers as possible.\n\n00:11:32.228 --> 00:11:36.444\nAnd this is key to the potential of that technology.\n\n00:11:36.444 --> 00:11:38.981\nNow let me show you our instrument.\n\n00:11:38.981 --> 00:11:40.970\nThis is an instrument that our engineers\n\n00:11:40.970 --> 00:11:43.588\nare actually prototyping right now in the lab,\n\n00:11:43.588 --> 00:11:45.897\nand this instrument is going to give us\n\n00:11:45.897 --> 00:11:48.356\nthe engineering controls that we're going to require\n\n00:11:48.356 --> 00:11:52.524\nin order to link 10 or more organ chips together.\n\n00:11:52.524 --> 00:11:54.753\nIt does something else that's very important.\n\n00:11:54.753 --> 00:11:57.597\nIt creates an easy user interface.\n\n00:11:57.597 --> 00:12:00.587\nSo a cell biologist like me can come in,\n\n00:12:00.587 --> 00:12:02.595\ntake a chip, put it in a cartridge\n\n00:12:02.595 --> 00:12:04.527\nlike the prototype you see there,\n\n00:12:04.527 --> 00:12:06.598\nput the cartridge into the machine\n\n00:12:06.598 --> 00:12:08.086\njust like you would a C.D.,\n\n00:12:08.086 --> 00:12:09.218\nand away you go.\n\n00:12:09.218 --> 00:12:11.967\nPlug and play. Easy.\n\n00:12:11.967 --> 00:12:14.481\nNow, let's imagine a little bit\n\n00:12:14.481 --> 00:12:15.860\nwhat the future might look like\n\n00:12:15.860 --> 00:12:18.273\nif I could take your stem cells\n\n00:12:18.273 --> 00:12:19.713\nand put them on a chip,\n\n00:12:19.713 --> 00:12:22.932\nor your stem cells and put them on a chip.\n\n00:12:22.932 --> 00:12:26.433\nIt would be a personalized chip just for you.\n\n00:12:26.433 --> 00:12:29.641\nNow all of us in here are individuals,\n\n00:12:29.641 --> 00:12:32.479\nand those individual differences mean\n\n00:12:32.479 --> 00:12:34.921\nthat we could react very differently\n\n00:12:34.921 --> 00:12:39.168\nand sometimes in unpredictable ways to drugs.\n\n00:12:39.168 --> 00:12:43.736\nI myself, a couple of years back,\nhad a really bad headache,\n\n00:12:43.736 --> 00:12:46.149\njust couldn't shake it, thought, \n\"Well, I'll try something different.\"\n\n00:12:46.149 --> 00:12:48.284\nI took some Advil. Fifteen minutes later,\n\n00:12:48.284 --> 00:12:50.164\nI was on my way to the emergency room\n\n00:12:50.164 --> 00:12:52.057\nwith a full-blown asthma attack.\n\n00:12:52.057 --> 00:12:53.887\nNow, obviously it wasn't fatal,\n\n00:12:53.887 --> 00:12:57.060\nbut unfortunately, some of these\n\n00:12:57.060 --> 00:13:00.669\nadverse drug reactions can be fatal.\n\n00:13:00.669 --> 00:13:02.610\nSo how do we prevent them?\n\n00:13:02.610 --> 00:13:05.190\nWell, we could imagine one day\n\n00:13:05.190 --> 00:13:07.533\nhaving Geraldine on a chip,\n\n00:13:07.533 --> 00:13:09.282\nhaving Danielle on a chip,\n\n00:13:09.282 --> 00:13:10.755\nhaving you on a chip.\n\n00:13:10.755 --> 00:13:13.143\nPersonalized medicine. Thank you.\n\n00:13:13.143 --> 00:13:17.297\n(Applause)"}, {"title": "Let\u2019s try emotional correctness", "duration": "359", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/sally_kohn_let_s_try_emotional_correctness", "transcript": "So when I do my job, people hate me. In fact, the better I do my job, the more people hate me. And no, I'm not a meter maid, and I'm not an undertaker. I am a progressive, lesbian talking head on Fox News.(Applause)So y'all heard that, right? Just to make sure, right? I am a gay talking head on Fox News. I am going to tell you how I do it, and the most important thing I've learned.So I go on television. I debate people who literally want to obliterate everything I believe in \u2014 in some cases, who don't want me and people like me to even exist. It's sort of like Thanksgiving with your conservative uncle on steroids, with a live television audience of millions. It's totally almost just like that.And that's just on air. The hate mail I get is unbelievable. Last week alone, I got 238 pieces of nasty email and more hate tweets than I can even count. I was called an idiot, a traitor, a scourge, a cunt and an ugly man, and that was just in one email.(Laughter)So what have I realized, being on the receiving end of all this ugliness? Well, my biggest takeaway is that for decades, we've been focused on political correctness, but what matters more is emotional correctness. Let me give you a small example. I don't care if you call me a dyke. I really don't. I care about two things. One, I care that you spell it right.(Laughter) (Applause)Just quick refresher, it's D-Y-K-E. You'd totally be surprised. And second, I don't care about the word, I care about how you use it. Are you being friendly? Are you just being naive? Or do you really want to hurt me personally?Emotional correctness is the tone, the feeling, how we say what we say, the respect and compassion we show one another. And what I've realized is that political persuasion doesn't begin with ideas or facts or data. Political persuasion begins with being emotionally correct.So when I first went to go work at Fox News, true confession, I expected there to be marks in the carpet from all the knuckle-dragging. That, by the way, in case you're paying attention, is not emotionally correct. But liberals on my side, we can be self-righteous, we can be condescending, we can be dismissive of anyone who doesn't agree with us. In other words, we can be politically right but emotionally wrong. And incidentally, that means that people don't like us. Right?Now here's the kicker. Conservatives are really nice. I mean, not all of them, and not the ones who send me hate mail, but you would be surprised. Sean Hannity is one of the sweetest guys I've ever met. He spends his free time trying to fix up his staff on blind dates, and I know that if I ever had a problem, he would do anything he could to help. Now, I think Sean Hannity is 99 percent politically wrong, but his emotional correctness is strikingly impressive. And that's why people listen to him. Because you can't get anyone to agree with you if they don't even listen to you first. We spend so much time talking past each other and not enough time talking through our disagreements. And if we can start to find compassion for one another, then we have a shot at building common ground. It actually sounds really hokey to say it standing up here, but when you try to put it in practice, it's really powerful.So someone who says they hate immigrants, I try to imagine how scared they must be that their community is changing from what they've always known. Or someone who says they don't like teachers' unions, I bet they're really devastated to see their kid's school going into the gutter, and they're just looking for someone to blame. Our challenge is to find the compassion for others that we want them to have for us. That is emotional correctness.I'm not saying it's easy. An average of, like, 5.6 times per day I have to stop myself from responding to all of my hate mail with a flurry of vile profanities. This whole finding compassion and common ground with your enemies thing is kind of like a political-spiritual practice for me, and I ain't the Dalai Lama. I'm not perfect, but what I am is optimistic. Because I don't just get hate mail. I get a lot of really nice letters, lots of them. And one of my all-time favorites begins: \"I am not a big fan of your political leanings or your sometimes tortured logic,(Laughter)but I'm a big fan of you as a person.\" Now this guy doesn't agree with me \u2014 yet.(Laughter)But he's listening \u2014 not because of what I said, but because of how I said it.

NASA uses this extreme environment to train astronauts and aquanauts, and last year, they invited us along for the ride. All the footage was taken from our open ROV, which is a robot that we built in our garage.So ROV stands for Remote Operated Vehicle, which in our case means our little robot sends live video across that ultra-thin tether back to the computer topside. It's open source, meaning we publish and share all of our design files and all of our code online, allowing anyone to modify or improve or change the design. It's built with mostly off-the-shelf parts and costs about 1,000 times cheaper than the ROVs James Cameron used to explore the Titanic. So ROVs aren't new. They've been around for decades. Scientists use ROVs to explore the oceans. Oil and gas companies use them for exploration and construction. What we've built isn't unique. It's how we've built it that's really unique.So I want to give you a quick story of how it got started. So a few years ago, my friend Eric and I decided we wanted to explore this underwater cave in the foothills of the Sierras. We had heard this story about lost gold from a Gold Rush-era robbery, and we wanted to go up there. Unfortunately, we didn't have any money and we didn't have any tools to do it. So Eric had an initial design idea for a robot, but we didn't have all the parts figured out, so we did what anybody would do in our situation: we asked the Internet for help. More specifically, we created this website, openROV.com, and shared  our intentions and our plans For the first few months, it was just Eric and I talking back to each other on the forums, but pretty soon, we started to get feedback from makers and hobbyists, and then actually professional ocean engineers who had some suggestions for what we should do. We kept working on it. We learned a lot. We kept prototyping, and eventually, we decided we wanted to go  to the cave. We were ready.So about that time, our little expedition became quite a story, and it got picked up in The New York Times. And we were pretty much just overwhelmed with interest from people who wanted a kit that they could build this open ROV themselves.So we decided to put the project on Kickstarter, and when we did, we raised our funding goal in about two hours, and all of a sudden,  had this money to make these kits. But then we had to learn how to make them. I mean, we had to learn small batch manufacturing. So we quickly learned that our garage was not big enough to hold our growing operation. But we were able to do it, we got all the kits made, thanks a lot to TechShop, which was a big help to us, and we shipped these kits all over the world just before Christmas of last year, so it was just a few months ago. But we're already starting to get video and photos back from all over the world, including this shot from under the ice in Antarctica. We've also learned the penguins love robots. (Laughter)So we're still publishing all the designs online, encouraging anyone to build these themselves. That's the only way that we could have done this. By being open source, we've created this distributed R&D network, and we're moving faster than any venture-backed counterpart. But the actual robot is really only half the story. The real potential, the long term potential, is with this community of DIY ocean explorers that are forming all over the globe. What can we discover when there's thousands of these devices roaming the seas?So you're probably all wondering: the cave. Did you find the gold? Well, we didn't find any gold, but we decided that what we found was much more valuable. It was the glimpse into a potential future for ocean exploration. It's something that's not limited to the James Camerons of the world, but something that we're all participating in.

We were ready.\n\n00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:29.800\nSo about that time, our little expedition\nbecame quite a story,\n\n00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:31.821\nand it got picked up in The New York Times.\n\n00:02:31.821 --> 00:02:33.633\nAnd we were pretty much just overwhelmed\n\n00:02:33.633 --> 00:02:35.416\nwith interest from people who wanted a kit\n\n00:02:35.416 --> 00:02:37.937\nthat they could build this open ROV themselves.\n\n00:02:37.937 --> 00:02:41.226\nSo we decided to put the project on Kickstarter,\n\n00:02:41.226 --> 00:02:42.458\nand when we did,\n\n00:02:42.458 --> 00:02:44.533\nwe raised our funding goal in about two hours,\n\n00:02:44.533 --> 00:02:47.738\nand all of a sudden, \nhad this money to make these kits.\n\n00:02:47.738 --> 00:02:49.933\nBut then we had to learn how to make them.\n\n00:02:49.933 --> 00:02:52.098\nI mean, we had to learn small batch manufacturing.\n\n00:02:52.098 --> 00:02:55.358\nSo we quickly learned that our garage\n\n00:02:55.358 --> 00:02:58.037\nwas not big enough to hold our growing operation.\n\n00:02:58.037 --> 00:03:00.193\nBut we were able to do it, we got all the kits made,\n\n00:03:00.193 --> 00:03:02.900\nthanks a lot to TechShop,\nwhich was a big help to us,\n\n00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:05.885\nand we shipped these kits all over the world\n\n00:03:05.885 --> 00:03:07.714\njust before Christmas of last year,\n\n00:03:07.714 --> 00:03:09.496\nso it was just a few months ago.\n\n00:03:09.496 --> 00:03:11.404\nBut we're already starting to get video\n\n00:03:11.404 --> 00:03:13.002\nand photos back from all over the world,\n\n00:03:13.002 --> 00:03:16.032\nincluding this shot from under the ice in Antarctica.\n\n00:03:16.032 --> 00:03:19.432\nWe've also learned the penguins love robots.\n\n00:03:19.432 --> 00:03:21.445\n(Laughter)\n\n00:03:21.445 --> 00:03:24.613\nSo we're still publishing all the designs online,\n\n00:03:24.613 --> 00:03:26.731\nencouraging anyone to build these themselves.\n\n00:03:26.731 --> 00:03:29.134\nThat's the only way that we could have done this.\n\n00:03:29.134 --> 00:03:30.793\nBy being open source, we've created\n\n00:03:30.793 --> 00:03:33.057\nthis distributed R&amp;D network,\n\n00:03:33.057 --> 00:03:36.853\nand we're moving faster than\nany venture-backed counterpart.\n\n00:03:36.853 --> 00:03:40.058\nBut the actual robot is really only half the story.\n\n00:03:40.058 --> 00:03:42.554\nThe real potential, the long term potential,\n\n00:03:42.554 --> 00:03:45.231\nis with this community of DIY ocean explorers\n\n00:03:45.231 --> 00:03:47.627\nthat are forming all over the globe.\n\n00:03:47.627 --> 00:03:49.161\nWhat can we discover\n\n00:03:49.161 --> 00:03:51.065\nwhen there's thousands of these devices\n\n00:03:51.065 --> 00:03:53.111\nroaming the seas?\n\n00:03:53.111 --> 00:03:55.387\nSo you're probably all wondering: the cave.\n\n00:03:55.387 --> 00:03:57.213\nDid you find the gold?\n\n00:03:57.213 --> 00:03:58.765\nWell, we didn't find any gold,\n\n00:03:58.765 --> 00:04:01.994\nbut we decided that what we found\nwas much more valuable.\n\n00:04:01.994 --> 00:04:04.466\nIt was the glimpse into a potential future\n\n00:04:04.466 --> 00:04:06.141\nfor ocean exploration.\n\n00:04:06.141 --> 00:04:09.051\nIt's something that's not limited to\nthe James Camerons of the world,\n\n00:04:09.051 --> 00:04:11.646\nbut something that we're all participating in.\n\n00:04:11.646 --> 00:04:12.979\nIt's an underwater world\n\n00:04:12.979 --> 00:04:15.490\nwe're all exploring together.\n\n00:04:15.490 --> 00:04:17.665\nThank you.\n\n00:04:17.665 --> 00:04:21.665\n(Applause)"}, {"title": "Why buses represent democracy in action", "duration": "857", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/enrique_penalosa_why_buses_represent_democracy_in_action", "transcript": "Mobility in developing world cities is a very peculiar challenge, because different from health or education or housing, it tends to get worse as societies become richer. Clearly, a unsustainable model. Mobility, as most other developing country problems, more than a matter of money or technology, is a matter of equality, equity. The great inequality in developing countries makes it difficult to see, for example, that in terms of transport, an advanced city is not one where even the poor use cars, but rather one where even the rich use public transport. Or bicycles: For example, in Amsterdam, more than 30 percent of the population uses bicycles, despite the fact that the Netherlands has a higher income per capita than the United States. There is a conflict in developing world cities for money, for government investment. If more money is invested in highways, of course there is less money for housing, for schools, for hospitals, and also there is a conflict for space. There is a conflict for space between those with cars and those without them. Most of us accept today that private property and a market economy is the best way to manage most of society's resources. However, there is a problem with that, that market economy needs inequality of income in order to work. Some people must make more money, some others less. Some companies succeed. Others fail. Then what kind of equality can we hope for today with a market economy?I would propose two kinds which both have much to do with cities. The first one is equality of quality of life, especially for children, that all children should have, beyond the obvious health and education, access to green spaces, to sports facilities, to swimming pools, to music lessons. And the second kind of equality is one which we could call \"democratic equality.\" The first article in every constitution states that all citizens are equal before the law. That is not just poetry. It's a very powerful principle. For example, if that is true, a bus with 80 passengers has a right to 80 times more road space than a car with one.We have been so used to inequality, sometimes, that it's before our noses and we do not see it. Less than 100 years ago, women could not vote, and it seemed normal, in the same way that it seems normal today to see a bus in traffic. In fact, when I became mayor, applying that democratic principle that public good prevails over private interest, that a bus with 100 people has a right to 100 times more road space than a car, we implemented a mass transit system based on buses in exclusive lanes. We called it TransMilenio, in order to make buses sexier. And one thing is that it is also a very beautiful democratic symbol, because as buses zoom by, expensive cars stuck in traffic, it clearly is almost a picture of democracy at work. In fact, it's not just a matter of equity. It doesn't take Ph.D.'s. A committee of 12-year-old children would find out in 20 minutes that the most efficient way to use scarce road space is with exclusive lanes for buses. In fact, buses are not sexy, but they are the only possible means to bring mass transit to all areas of fast growing developing cities. They also have great capacity. For example, this system in Guangzhou is moving more passengers our direction than all subway lines in China, except for one line in Beijing, at a fraction of the cost.We fought not just for space for buses, but we fought for space for people, and that was even more difficult. Cities are human habitats, and we humans are pedestrians. Just as fish need to swim or birds need to fly or deer need to run, we need to walk. There is a really enormous conflict, when we are talking about developing country cities, between pedestrians and cars. Here, what you see is a picture that shows insufficient democracy. What this shows is that people who walk are third-class citizens while those who go in cars are first-class citizens. In terms of transport infrastructure, what really makes a difference between advanced and backward cities is not highways or subways but quality sidewalks. Here they made a flyover, probably very useless, and they forgot to make a sidewalk. This is prevailing all over the world. Not even schoolchildren are more important than cars.In my city of Bogot\u00e1, we fought a very difficult battle in order to take space from cars, which had been parking on sidewalks for decades, in order to make space for people that should reflect dignity of human beings, and to make space for protected bikeways. First of all, I had black hair before that. (Laughter) And I was almost impeached in the process. It is a very difficult battle. However, it was possible, finally, after very difficult battles, to make a city that would reflect some respect for human dignity, that would show that those who walk are equally important to those who have cars. Indeed, a very important ideological and political issue anywhere is how to distribute that most valuable resource of a city, which is road space. A city could find oil or diamonds underground and it would not be so valuable as road space. How to distribute it between pedestrians, bicycles, public transport and cars? This is not a technological issue, and we should remember that in no constitution parking is a constitutional right when we make that distribution.We also built, and this was 15 years ago, before there were bikeways in New York or in Paris or in London, it was a very difficult battle as well, more than 350 kilometers of protected bicycle ways. I don't think protected bicycle ways are a cute architectural feature. They are a right, just as sidewalks are, unless we believe that only those with access to a motor vehicle have a right to safe mobility, without the risk of getting killed. And just as busways are, protected bikeways also are a powerful symbol of democracy, because they show that a citizen on a $30 bicycle is equally important to one in a $30,000 car.And we are living in a unique moment in history. In the next 50 years, more than half of those cities which will exist in the year 2060 will be built. In many developing country cities, more than 80 and 90 percent of the city which will exist in 2060 will be built over the next four or five decades.But this is not just a matter for developing country cities. In the United States, for example, more than 70 million new homes must be built over the next 40 or 50 years. That's more than all the homes that today exist in Britain, France and Canada put together. And I believe that our cities today have severe flaws, and that different, better ones could be built.What is wrong with our cities today? Well, for example, if we tell any three-year-old child who is barely learning to speak in any city in the world today, \"Watch out, a car,\" the child will jump in fright, and with a very good reason, because there are more than 10,000 children who are killed by cars every year in the world. We have had cities for 8,000 years, and children could walk out of home and play. In fact, only very recently, towards 1900, there were no cars. Cars have been here for really less than 100 years. They completely changed cities. In 1900, for example, nobody was killed by cars in the United States. Only 20 years later, between 1920 and 1930, almost 200,000 people were killed by cars in the United States. Only in 1925, almost 7,000 children were killed by cars in the United States. So we could make different cities, cities that will give more priority to human beings than to cars, that will give more public space to human beings than to cars, cities which show great respect for those most vulnerable citizens, such as children or the elderly.I will propose to you a couple of ingredients which I think would make cities much better, and it would be very simple to implement them in the new cities which are only being created. Hundreds of kilometers of greenways criss-crossing cities in all directions. Children will walk out of homes into safe spaces. They could go for dozens of kilometers safely without any risk in wonderful greenways, sort of bicycle highways, and I would invite you to imagine the following: a city in which every other street would be a street only for pedestrians and bicycles. In new cities which are going to be built, this would not be particularly difficult. When I was mayor of Bogot\u00e1, in only three years, we were able to create 70 kilometers, in one of the most dense cities in the world, of these bicycle highways. And this changes the way people live, move, enjoy the city. In this picture, you see in one of the very poor neighborhoods, we have a luxury pedestrian bicycle street, and the cars still in the mud. Of course, I would love to pave this street for cars. But what do we do first? Ninety-nine percent of the people in those neighborhoods don't have cars. But you see, when a city is only being created, it's very easy to incorporate this kind of infrastructure. Then the city grows around it. And of course this is just a glimpse of something which could be much better if we just create it, and it changes the way of life.And the second ingredient, which would solve mobility, that very difficult challenge in developing countries, in a very low-cost and simple way, would be to have hundreds of kilometers of streets only for buses, buses and bicycles and pedestrians. This would be, again, a very low-cost solution if implemented from the start, low cost, pleasant transit with natural sunlight.But unfortunately, reality is not as good as my dreams. Because of private property of land and high land prices, all developing country cities have a large problem of slums. In my country of Colombia, almost half the homes in cities initially were illegal developments. And of course it's very difficult to have mass transit or to use bicycles in such environments. But even legal developments have also been located in the wrong places, very far from the city centers where it's impossible to provide low-cost, high-frequency public transport. As a Latin American, and Latin America was the most recently organized region in the world, I would recommend, respectfully, passionately, to those countries which are yet to urbanize \u2014 Latin America went from 40 percent urban in 1950 to 80 percent urban in 2010 \u2014 I would recommend Asian and African countries which are yet to urbanize, such as India which is only 33 percent urban now, that governments should acquire all land around cities. In this way, their cities could grow in the right places with the right spaces, with the parks, with the greenways, with the busways.The cities we are going to build over the next 50 years will determine quality of life and even happiness for billions of people towards the future. What a fantastic opportunity for leaders and many young leaders to come, especially in the developing countries. They can create a much happier life for billions towards the future. I am sure, I am optimistic, that they will make cities better than our most ambitious dreams.(Applause)", "id": 1886, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:12.203 --> 00:00:15.336\nMobility in developing world cities\n\n00:00:15.336 --> 00:00:17.494\nis a very peculiar challenge,\n\n00:00:17.494 --> 00:00:19.299\nbecause different from health\n\n00:00:19.299 --> 00:00:21.609\nor education or housing,\n\n00:00:21.609 --> 00:00:25.043\nit tends to get worse as societies become richer.\n\n00:00:25.043 --> 00:00:27.827\nClearly, a unsustainable model.\n\n00:00:27.827 --> 00:00:32.154\nMobility, as most other developing country problems,\n\n00:00:32.154 --> 00:00:36.059\nmore than a matter of money or technology,\n\n00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:41.450\nis a matter of equality, equity.\n\n00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:44.559\nThe great inequality in developing countries\n\n00:00:44.559 --> 00:00:47.984\nmakes it difficult to see, for example,\n\n00:00:47.984 --> 00:00:50.548\nthat in terms of transport,\n\n00:00:50.548 --> 00:00:52.478\nan advanced city is not one\n\n00:00:52.478 --> 00:00:54.500\nwhere even the poor use cars,\n\n00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:56.523\nbut rather one where even the rich\n\n00:00:56.523 --> 00:00:58.747\nuse public transport.\n\n00:00:58.747 --> 00:01:02.313\nOr bicycles: For example, in Amsterdam,\n\n00:01:02.313 --> 00:01:04.343\nmore than 30 percent of the population\n\n00:01:04.343 --> 00:01:05.878\nuses bicycles,\n\n00:01:05.878 --> 00:01:07.776\ndespite the fact that the Netherlands has\n\n00:01:07.776 --> 00:01:11.759\na higher income per capita than the United States.\n\n00:01:11.759 --> 00:01:15.616\nThere is a conflict in developing world cities\n\n00:01:15.616 --> 00:01:18.184\nfor money, for government investment.\n\n00:01:18.184 --> 00:01:20.685\nIf more money is invested in highways,\n\n00:01:20.685 --> 00:01:22.697\nof course there is less money for housing,\n\n00:01:22.697 --> 00:01:25.054\nfor schools, for hospitals,\n\n00:01:25.054 --> 00:01:29.030\nand also there is a conflict for space.\n\n00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:31.456\nThere is a conflict for space between\n\n00:01:31.456 --> 00:01:33.981\nthose with cars and those without them.\n\n00:01:33.981 --> 00:01:35.824\nMost of us accept today\n\n00:01:35.824 --> 00:01:38.608\nthat private property and a market economy\n\n00:01:38.608 --> 00:01:41.806\nis the best way to manage\nmost of society's resources.\n\n00:01:41.806 --> 00:01:44.211\nHowever, there is a problem with that,\n\n00:01:44.211 --> 00:01:46.879\nthat market economy needs\n\n00:01:46.879 --> 00:01:49.597\ninequality of income in order to work.\n\n00:01:49.597 --> 00:01:51.139\nSome people must make more money,\n\n00:01:51.139 --> 00:01:52.690\nsome others less.\n\n00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:55.259\nSome companies succeed. Others fail.\n\n00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:57.133\nThen what kind of equality\n\n00:01:57.133 --> 00:01:58.738\ncan we hope for today\n\n00:01:58.738 --> 00:02:00.660\nwith a market economy?\n\n00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:02.596\nI would propose two kinds\n\n00:02:02.596 --> 00:02:04.950\nwhich both have much to do with cities.\n\n00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:08.056\nThe first one is equality of quality of life,\n\n00:02:08.056 --> 00:02:09.844\nespecially for children,\n\n00:02:09.844 --> 00:02:11.499\nthat all children should have,\n\n00:02:11.499 --> 00:02:14.506\nbeyond the obvious health and education,\n\n00:02:14.506 --> 00:02:18.365\naccess to green spaces, to sports facilities,\n\n00:02:18.365 --> 00:02:21.391\nto swimming pools, to music lessons.\n\n00:02:21.391 --> 00:02:23.882\nAnd the second kind of equality\n\n00:02:23.882 --> 00:02:28.165\nis one which we could call \"democratic equality.\"\n\n00:02:28.165 --> 00:02:31.114\nThe first article in every constitution states\n\n00:02:31.114 --> 00:02:34.403\nthat all citizens are equal before the law.\n\n00:02:34.403 --> 00:02:36.858\nThat is not just poetry.\n\n00:02:36.858 --> 00:02:39.059\nIt's a very powerful principle.\n\n00:02:39.059 --> 00:02:41.645\nFor example, if that is true,\n\n00:02:41.645 --> 00:02:43.530\na bus with 80 passengers\n\n00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:46.259\nhas a right to 80 times more road space\n\n00:02:46.259 --> 00:02:49.131\nthan a car with one.\n\n00:02:49.131 --> 00:02:53.524\nWe have been so used to inequality, sometimes,\n\n00:02:53.524 --> 00:02:57.255\nthat it's before our noses and we do not see it.\n\n00:02:57.255 --> 00:02:59.531\nLess than 100 years ago,\n\n00:02:59.531 --> 00:03:00.918\nwomen could not vote,\n\n00:03:00.918 --> 00:03:03.124\nand it seemed normal,\n\n00:03:03.124 --> 00:03:06.808\nin the same way that it seems normal today\n\n00:03:06.808 --> 00:03:09.740\nto see a bus in traffic.\n\n00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:12.691\nIn fact, when I became mayor,\n\n00:03:12.691 --> 00:03:15.659\napplying that democratic principle\n\n00:03:15.659 --> 00:03:18.071\nthat public good prevails over private interest,\n\n00:03:18.071 --> 00:03:20.971\nthat a bus with 100 people\n\n00:03:20.971 --> 00:03:23.545\nhas a right to 100 times\nmore road space than a car,\n\n00:03:23.545 --> 00:03:26.559\nwe implemented a mass transit system\n\n00:03:26.559 --> 00:03:29.028\nbased on buses in exclusive lanes.\n\n00:03:29.028 --> 00:03:33.470\nWe called it TransMilenio,\nin order to make buses sexier.\n\n00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:41.267\nAnd one thing is that it is also a very beautiful\ndemocratic symbol, because as buses zoom by,\n\n00:03:41.267 --> 00:03:45.431\nexpensive cars stuck in traffic,\n\n00:03:45.431 --> 00:03:51.758\nit clearly is almost a picture of democracy at work.\n\n00:03:51.758 --> 00:03:55.587\nIn fact, it's not just a matter of equity.\n\n00:03:55.587 --> 00:03:57.479\nIt doesn't take Ph.D.'s.\n\n00:03:57.479 --> 00:03:59.751\nA committee of 12-year-old children\n\n00:03:59.751 --> 00:04:01.757\nwould find out in 20 minutes\n\n00:04:01.757 --> 00:04:05.461\nthat the most efficient way to use scarce road space\n\n00:04:05.461 --> 00:04:08.945\nis with exclusive lanes for buses.\n\n00:04:08.945 --> 00:04:12.267\nIn fact, buses are not sexy,\n\n00:04:12.267 --> 00:04:15.414\nbut they are the only possible means\n\n00:04:15.414 --> 00:04:18.697\nto bring mass transit to all areas\n\n00:04:18.697 --> 00:04:22.372\nof fast growing developing cities.\n\n00:04:22.372 --> 00:04:24.547\nThey also have great capacity.\n\n00:04:24.547 --> 00:04:27.291\nFor example, this system in Guangzhou\n\n00:04:27.291 --> 00:04:29.996\nis moving more passengers our direction\n\n00:04:29.996 --> 00:04:32.820\nthan all subway lines in China,\n\n00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:35.311\nexcept for one line in Beijing,\n\n00:04:35.311 --> 00:04:37.648\nat a fraction of the cost.\n\n00:04:37.648 --> 00:04:41.762\nWe fought not just for space for buses,\n\n00:04:41.762 --> 00:04:44.818\nbut we fought for space for people,\n\n00:04:44.818 --> 00:04:48.031\nand that was even more difficult.\n\n00:04:48.031 --> 00:04:50.816\nCities are human habitats,\n\n00:04:50.816 --> 00:04:54.545\nand we humans are pedestrians.\n\n00:04:54.545 --> 00:04:57.609\nJust as fish need to swim or birds need to fly\n\n00:04:57.609 --> 00:05:00.401\nor deer need to run, we need to walk.\n\n00:05:00.401 --> 00:05:03.732\nThere is a really enormous conflict,\n\n00:05:03.732 --> 00:05:06.733\nwhen we are talking about developing country cities,\n\n00:05:06.733 --> 00:05:09.412\nbetween pedestrians and cars.\n\n00:05:09.412 --> 00:05:12.343\nHere, what you see is a picture that shows\n\n00:05:12.343 --> 00:05:13.995\ninsufficient democracy.\n\n00:05:13.995 --> 00:05:17.087\nWhat this shows is that people who walk\n\n00:05:17.087 --> 00:05:18.762\nare third-class citizens\n\n00:05:18.762 --> 00:05:20.097\nwhile those who go in cars\n\n00:05:20.097 --> 00:05:21.912\nare first-class citizens.\n\n00:05:21.912 --> 00:05:24.319\nIn terms of transport infrastructure,\n\n00:05:24.319 --> 00:05:25.522\nwhat really makes a difference\n\n00:05:25.522 --> 00:05:28.068\nbetween advanced and backward cities\n\n00:05:28.068 --> 00:05:30.160\nis not highways or subways\n\n00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:32.424\nbut quality sidewalks.\n\n00:05:32.424 --> 00:05:35.190\nHere they made a flyover, probably very useless,\n\n00:05:35.190 --> 00:05:39.148\nand they forgot to make a sidewalk.\n\n00:05:39.148 --> 00:05:41.472\nThis is prevailing all over the world.\n\n00:05:41.472 --> 00:05:45.257\nNot even schoolchildren\nare more important than cars.\n\n00:05:45.257 --> 00:05:47.498\nIn my city of Bogot\u00e1,\n\n00:05:47.498 --> 00:05:50.852\nwe fought a very difficult battle\n\n00:05:50.852 --> 00:05:53.626\nin order to take space from cars,\n\n00:05:53.626 --> 00:05:56.522\nwhich had been parking on sidewalks for decades,\n\n00:05:56.522 --> 00:05:59.637\nin order to make space for people that should reflect\n\n00:05:59.637 --> 00:06:01.305\ndignity of human beings,\n\n00:06:01.305 --> 00:06:04.154\nand to make space for protected bikeways.\n\n00:06:04.154 --> 00:06:06.899\nFirst of all, I had black hair before that.\n\n00:06:06.899 --> 00:06:08.875\n(Laughter)\n\n00:06:08.875 --> 00:06:12.131\nAnd I was almost impeached in the process.\n\n00:06:12.131 --> 00:06:14.275\nIt is a very difficult battle.\n\n00:06:14.275 --> 00:06:17.452\nHowever, it was possible, finally,\n\n00:06:17.452 --> 00:06:20.690\nafter very difficult battles, to make a city\n\n00:06:20.690 --> 00:06:23.374\nthat would reflect some respect for human dignity,\n\n00:06:23.374 --> 00:06:25.169\nthat would show that those who walk are equally\n\n00:06:25.169 --> 00:06:26.990\nimportant to those who have cars.\n\n00:06:26.990 --> 00:06:31.639\nIndeed, a very important ideological\nand political issue anywhere\n\n00:06:31.639 --> 00:06:34.585\nis how to distribute that most valuable resource\n\n00:06:34.585 --> 00:06:36.994\nof a city, which is road space.\n\n00:06:36.994 --> 00:06:39.831\nA city could find oil or diamonds underground\n\n00:06:39.831 --> 00:06:41.922\nand it would not be so valuable as road space.\n\n00:06:41.922 --> 00:06:45.083\nHow to distribute it between pedestrians,\n\n00:06:45.083 --> 00:06:48.185\nbicycles, public transport and cars?\n\n00:06:48.185 --> 00:06:50.976\nThis is not a technological issue,\n\n00:06:50.976 --> 00:06:54.500\nand we should remember that in no constitution\n\n00:06:54.500 --> 00:06:56.821\nparking is a constitutional right\n\n00:06:56.821 --> 00:06:59.322\nwhen we make that distribution.\n\n00:06:59.322 --> 00:07:02.953\nWe also built, and this was 15 years ago,\n\n00:07:02.953 --> 00:07:04.891\nbefore there were bikeways in New York\n\n00:07:04.891 --> 00:07:06.335\nor in Paris or in London,\n\n00:07:06.335 --> 00:07:08.782\nit was a very difficult battle as well,\n\n00:07:08.782 --> 00:07:13.602\nmore than 350 kilometers of protected bicycle ways.\n\n00:07:13.602 --> 00:07:15.526\nI don't think protected bicycle ways\n\n00:07:15.526 --> 00:07:18.280\nare a cute architectural feature.\n\n00:07:18.280 --> 00:07:20.986\nThey are a right, just as sidewalks are,\n\n00:07:20.986 --> 00:07:23.184\nunless we believe that only those\n\n00:07:23.184 --> 00:07:25.518\nwith access to a motor vehicle\n\n00:07:25.518 --> 00:07:27.585\nhave a right to safe mobility,\n\n00:07:27.585 --> 00:07:29.858\nwithout the risk of getting killed.\n\n00:07:29.858 --> 00:07:33.525\nAnd just as busways are,\n\n00:07:33.525 --> 00:07:35.616\nprotected bikeways also are\n\n00:07:35.616 --> 00:07:37.495\na powerful symbol of democracy,\n\n00:07:37.495 --> 00:07:41.145\nbecause they show that a citizen on a $30 bicycle\n\n00:07:41.145 --> 00:07:43.567\nis equally important\n\n00:07:43.567 --> 00:07:47.509\nto one in a $30,000 car.\n\n00:07:47.509 --> 00:07:51.226\nAnd we are living in a unique moment in history.\n\n00:07:51.226 --> 00:07:55.678\nIn the next 50 years, more than half of those cities\n\n00:07:55.678 --> 00:08:00.240\nwhich will exist in the year 2060 will be built.\n\n00:08:00.240 --> 00:08:02.538\nIn many developing country cities,\n\n00:08:02.538 --> 00:08:04.598\nmore than 80 and 90 percent\n\n00:08:04.598 --> 00:08:09.300\nof the city which will exist in 2060\n\n00:08:09.300 --> 00:08:11.661\nwill be built over the next four or five decades.\n\n00:08:11.661 --> 00:08:14.783\nBut this is not just a matter\nfor developing country cities.\n\n00:08:14.783 --> 00:08:16.772\nIn the United States, for example,\n\n00:08:16.772 --> 00:08:19.437\nmore than 70 million new homes\n\n00:08:19.437 --> 00:08:22.134\nmust be built over the next 40 or 50 years.\n\n00:08:22.134 --> 00:08:25.207\nThat's more than all the homes that today exist\n\n00:08:25.207 --> 00:08:29.723\nin Britain, France and Canada put together.\n\n00:08:29.723 --> 00:08:33.080\nAnd I believe that our cities today\n\n00:08:33.080 --> 00:08:35.195\nhave severe flaws,\n\n00:08:35.195 --> 00:08:38.753\nand that different, better ones could be built.\n\n00:08:38.753 --> 00:08:41.201\nWhat is wrong with our cities today?\n\n00:08:41.201 --> 00:08:45.435\nWell, for example, if we tell any three-year-old child\n\n00:08:45.435 --> 00:08:47.140\nwho is barely learning to speak\n\n00:08:47.140 --> 00:08:48.651\nin any city in the world today,\n\n00:08:48.651 --> 00:08:50.333\n\"Watch out, a car,\"\n\n00:08:50.333 --> 00:08:52.895\nthe child will jump in fright,\n\n00:08:52.895 --> 00:08:54.674\nand with a very good reason, because there are\n\n00:08:54.674 --> 00:08:57.231\nmore than 10,000 children who are killed\n\n00:08:57.231 --> 00:09:00.700\nby cars every year in the world.\n\n00:09:00.700 --> 00:09:03.308\nWe have had cities for 8,000 years,\n\n00:09:03.308 --> 00:09:07.644\nand children could walk out of home and play.\n\n00:09:07.644 --> 00:09:09.936\nIn fact, only very recently,\n\n00:09:09.936 --> 00:09:11.770\ntowards 1900, there were no cars.\n\n00:09:11.770 --> 00:09:15.771\nCars have been here for really\nless than 100 years.\n\n00:09:15.771 --> 00:09:18.545\nThey completely changed cities.\n\n00:09:18.545 --> 00:09:20.493\nIn 1900, for example,\n\n00:09:20.493 --> 00:09:24.379\nnobody was killed by cars in the United States.\n\n00:09:24.379 --> 00:09:26.294\nOnly 20 years later,\n\n00:09:26.294 --> 00:09:29.689\nbetween 1920 and 1930,\n\n00:09:29.689 --> 00:09:32.047\nalmost 200,000 people\n\n00:09:32.047 --> 00:09:34.557\nwere killed by cars in the United States.\n\n00:09:34.557 --> 00:09:38.588\nOnly in 1925, almost 7,000 children\n\n00:09:38.588 --> 00:09:42.540\nwere killed by cars in the United States.\n\n00:09:42.540 --> 00:09:46.543\nSo we could make different cities,\n\n00:09:46.543 --> 00:09:49.304\ncities that will give more priority to human beings\n\n00:09:49.304 --> 00:09:51.763\nthan to cars, that will give more public space\n\n00:09:51.763 --> 00:09:53.887\nto human beings than to cars,\n\n00:09:53.887 --> 00:09:56.642\ncities which show great respect\n\n00:09:56.642 --> 00:09:58.803\nfor those most vulnerable citizens,\n\n00:09:58.803 --> 00:10:00.587\nsuch as children or the elderly.\n\n00:10:00.587 --> 00:10:04.392\nI will propose to you a couple of ingredients\n\n00:10:04.392 --> 00:10:07.734\nwhich I think would make cities much better,\n\n00:10:07.734 --> 00:10:10.219\nand it would be very simple to implement them\n\n00:10:10.219 --> 00:10:13.143\nin the new cities which are only being created.\n\n00:10:13.143 --> 00:10:16.196\nHundreds of kilometers of greenways\n\n00:10:16.196 --> 00:10:19.346\ncriss-crossing cities in all directions.\n\n00:10:19.346 --> 00:10:22.090\nChildren will walk out of homes into safe spaces.\n\n00:10:22.090 --> 00:10:25.051\nThey could go for dozens of kilometers safely\n\n00:10:25.051 --> 00:10:28.105\nwithout any risk in wonderful greenways,\n\n00:10:28.105 --> 00:10:30.521\nsort of bicycle highways,\n\n00:10:30.521 --> 00:10:33.626\nand I would invite you to imagine the following:\n\n00:10:33.626 --> 00:10:36.864\na city in which every other street would be\n\n00:10:36.864 --> 00:10:41.935\na street only for pedestrians and bicycles.\n\n00:10:41.950 --> 00:10:44.181\nIn new cities which are going to be built,\n\n00:10:44.181 --> 00:10:46.726\nthis would not be particularly difficult.\n\n00:10:46.726 --> 00:10:50.253\nWhen I was mayor of Bogot\u00e1,\n\n00:10:50.253 --> 00:10:52.783\nin only three years, we were able to create\n\n00:10:52.783 --> 00:10:54.921\n70 kilometers,\n\n00:10:54.921 --> 00:10:57.417\nin one of the most dense cities in the world,\n\n00:10:57.417 --> 00:10:59.784\nof these bicycle highways.\n\n00:10:59.784 --> 00:11:03.174\nAnd this changes the way people live,\n\n00:11:03.174 --> 00:11:05.846\nmove, enjoy the city.\n\n00:11:05.846 --> 00:11:08.467\nIn this picture, you see in one\nof the very poor neighborhoods,\n\n00:11:08.467 --> 00:11:11.537\nwe have a luxury pedestrian bicycle street,\n\n00:11:11.537 --> 00:11:13.898\nand the cars still in the mud.\n\n00:11:13.898 --> 00:11:16.721\nOf course, I would love to pave this street for cars.\n\n00:11:16.721 --> 00:11:18.169\nBut what do we do first?\n\n00:11:18.169 --> 00:11:21.330\nNinety-nine percent of the people\nin those neighborhoods don't have cars.\n\n00:11:21.330 --> 00:11:23.803\nBut you see, when a city is only being created,\n\n00:11:23.803 --> 00:11:25.893\nit's very easy to incorporate\n\n00:11:25.893 --> 00:11:28.069\nthis kind of infrastructure.\n\n00:11:28.069 --> 00:11:30.767\nThen the city grows around it.\n\n00:11:30.767 --> 00:11:33.810\nAnd of course this is just a glimpse\n\n00:11:33.810 --> 00:11:36.605\nof something which could be much better\n\n00:11:36.605 --> 00:11:38.323\nif we just create it,\n\n00:11:38.323 --> 00:11:40.660\nand it changes the way of life.\n\n00:11:40.660 --> 00:11:44.726\nAnd the second ingredient,\nwhich would solve mobility,\n\n00:11:44.726 --> 00:11:47.304\nthat very difficult challenge in developing countries,\n\n00:11:47.304 --> 00:11:50.299\nin a very low-cost and simple way,\n\n00:11:50.299 --> 00:11:54.311\nwould be to have hundreds of kilometers\n\n00:11:54.311 --> 00:11:56.833\nof streets only for buses,\n\n00:11:56.833 --> 00:11:59.937\nbuses and bicycles and pedestrians.\n\n00:11:59.937 --> 00:12:02.976\nThis would be, again, a very low-cost solution\n\n00:12:02.976 --> 00:12:05.299\nif implemented from the start,\n\n00:12:05.299 --> 00:12:07.822\nlow cost, pleasant transit\n\n00:12:07.822 --> 00:12:11.520\nwith natural sunlight.\n\n00:12:11.520 --> 00:12:16.168\nBut unfortunately, reality is not as good\n\n00:12:16.168 --> 00:12:17.920\nas my dreams.\n\n00:12:17.920 --> 00:12:21.102\nBecause of private property of land\n\n00:12:21.102 --> 00:12:24.123\nand high land prices,\n\n00:12:24.123 --> 00:12:27.160\nall developing country cities\nhave a large problem of slums.\n\n00:12:27.160 --> 00:12:30.070\nIn my country of Colombia, almost half the homes\n\n00:12:30.070 --> 00:12:35.416\nin cities initially were illegal developments.\n\n00:12:35.416 --> 00:12:38.628\nAnd of course it's very difficult to have\n\n00:12:38.628 --> 00:12:42.584\nmass transit or to use bicycles in such environments.\n\n00:12:42.584 --> 00:12:44.630\nBut even legal developments\n\n00:12:44.630 --> 00:12:47.602\nhave also been located in the wrong places,\n\n00:12:47.602 --> 00:12:50.403\nvery far from the city centers\n\n00:12:50.403 --> 00:12:52.440\nwhere it's impossible to provide\n\n00:12:52.440 --> 00:12:56.271\nlow-cost, high-frequency public transport.\n\n00:12:56.271 --> 00:12:59.151\nAs a Latin American, and Latin America\n\n00:12:59.151 --> 00:13:02.578\nwas the most recently organized region in the world,\n\n00:13:02.578 --> 00:13:07.738\nI would recommend, respectfully, passionately,\n\n00:13:07.738 --> 00:13:11.848\nto those countries which are yet to urbanize --\n\n00:13:11.848 --> 00:13:16.869\nLatin America went from 40 percent urban in 1950\n\n00:13:16.869 --> 00:13:22.942\nto 80 percent urban in 2010 --\n\n00:13:22.942 --> 00:13:26.102\nI would recommend Asian and African countries\n\n00:13:26.102 --> 00:13:27.884\nwhich are yet to urbanize,\n\n00:13:27.884 --> 00:13:32.051\nsuch as India which is only 33 percent urban now,\n\n00:13:32.051 --> 00:13:35.026\nthat governments should acquire\nall land around cities.\n\n00:13:35.026 --> 00:13:37.547\nIn this way, their cities could grow in the right places\n\n00:13:37.547 --> 00:13:39.322\nwith the right spaces, with the parks,\n\n00:13:39.322 --> 00:13:42.698\nwith the greenways, with the busways.\n\n00:13:42.698 --> 00:13:44.213\nThe cities we are going to build\n\n00:13:44.213 --> 00:13:46.053\nover the next 50 years\n\n00:13:46.053 --> 00:13:48.450\nwill determine quality of life and even happiness\n\n00:13:48.450 --> 00:13:50.604\nfor billions of people towards the future.\n\n00:13:50.604 --> 00:13:54.182\nWhat a fantastic opportunity for leaders\n\n00:13:54.182 --> 00:13:56.424\nand many young leaders to come,\n\n00:13:56.424 --> 00:13:58.491\nespecially in the developing countries.\n\n00:13:58.491 --> 00:14:00.338\nThey can create a much happier life\n\n00:14:00.338 --> 00:14:01.907\nfor billions towards the future.\n\n00:14:01.907 --> 00:14:03.870\nI am sure, I am optimistic,\n\n00:14:03.870 --> 00:14:05.778\nthat they will make cities better\n\n00:14:05.778 --> 00:14:08.947\nthan our most ambitious dreams.\n\n00:14:08.947 --> 00:14:12.824\n(Applause)"}, {"title": "What I learned from Nelson Mandela", "duration": "899", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/boyd_varty_what_i_learned_from_nelson_mandela", "transcript": "I'm a man who's trying to live from his heart, and so just before I get going, I wanted to tell you as a South African that one of the men who has inspired me most passed away a few hours ago. Nelson Mandela has come to the end of his long walk to freedom. And so this talk is going to be for him.I grew up in wonder. I grew up amongst those animals. I grew up in the wild eastern part of South Africa at a place called Londolozi Game Reserve. It's a place where my family has been in the safari business for four generations. Now for as long as I can remember, my job has been to take people out into nature, and so I think it's a lovely twist of fate today to have the opportunity to bring some of my experiences out in nature in to this gathering. Africa is a place where people still sit under starlit skies and around campfires and tell stories, and so what I have to share with you today is the simple medicine of a few campfire stories, stories about heroes of heart. Now my stories are not the stories that you'll hear on the news, and while it's true that Africa is a harsh place, I also know it to be a place where people, animals and ecosystems teach us about a more interconnected world.When I was nine years old, President Mandela came to stay with my family. He had just been released from his 27 years of incarceration, and was in a period of readjustment to his sudden global icon status. Members of the African National Congress thought that in the bush he would have time to rest and recuperate away from the public eye, and it's true that lions tend to be a very good deterrent to press and paparazzi. (Laughter) But it was a defining time for me as a young boy. I would take him breakfast in bed, and then, in an old track suit and slippers, he would go for a walk around the garden. At night, I would sit with my family around the snowy, bunny-eared TV, and watch images of that same quiet man from the garden surrounded by hundreds and thousands of people as scenes from his release were broadcast nightly. He was bringing peace to a divided and violent South Africa, one man with an unbelievable sense of his humanity. Mandela said often that the gift of prison was the ability to go within and to think, to create in himself the things he most wanted for South Africa: peace, reconciliation, harmony. Through this act of immense open-heartedness, he was to become the embodiment of what in South Africa we call \"ubuntu.\" Ubuntu: I am because of you. Or, people are not people without other people. It's not a new idea or value but it's one that I certainly think at these times is worth building on. In fact, it is said that in the collective consciousness of Africa, we get to experience the deepest parts of our own humanity through our interactions with others. Ubuntu is at play right now. You are holding a space for me to express the deepest truth of who I am. Without you, I'm just a guy talking to an empty room, and I spent a lot of time last week doing that, and it's not the same as this. (Laughter)If Mandela was the national and international embodiment, then the man who taught me the most about this value personally was this man, Solly Mhlongo. Solly was born under a tree 60 kilometers from where I grew up in Mozambique. He would never have a lot of money, but he was to be one of the richest men I would ever meet. Solly grew up tending to his father's cattle. Now, I can tell you, I don't know what it is about people who grow up looking after cattle, but it makes for \u00fcber-resourcefulness. The first job that he ever got in the safari business was fixing the safari trucks. Where he had learned to do that out in the bush I have no idea, but he could do it. He then moved across into what we called the habitat team. These were the people on the reserve who were responsible for its well-being. He fixed roads, he mended wetlands, he did some anti-poaching. And then one day we were out together, and he came across the tracks of where a female leopard had walked. And it was an old track, but for fun he turned and he began to follow it, and I tell you, I could tell by the speed at which he moved on those pad marks that this man was a Ph.D.-level tracker. If you drove past Solly somewhere out on the reserve, you look up in your rearview mirror, you'd see he'd stopped the car 20, 50 meters down the road just in case you need help with something. The only accusation I ever heard leveled at him was when one of our clients said, \"Solly, you are pathologically helpful.\" (Laughter)When I started professionally guiding people out into this environment, Solly was my tracker. We worked together as a team. And the first guests we ever got were a philanthropy group from your East Coast, and they said to Solly, on the side, they said, \"Before we even go out to see lions and leopards, we want to see where you live.\" So we took them up to his house, and this visit of the philanthropist to his house coincided with a time when Solly's wife, who was learning English, was going through a phase where she would open the door by saying, \"Hello, I love you. Welcome, I love you.\" (Laughter) And there was something so beautifully African about it to me, this small house with a huge heart in it.Now on the day that Solly saved my life, he was already my hero. It was a hot day, and we found ourselves down by the river. Because of the heat, I took my shoes off, and I rolled up my pants, and I walked into the water. Solly remained on the bank. The water was clear running over sand, and we turned and we began to make our way upstream. And a few meters ahead of us, there was a place where a tree had fallen out of the bank, and its branches were touching the water, and it was shadowy. And if had been a horror movie, people in the audience would have started saying, \"Don't go in there. Don't go in there.\" (Laughter) And of course, the crocodile was in the shadows. Now the first thing that you notice when a crocodile hits you is the ferocity of the bite. Wham! It hits me by my right leg. It pulls me. It turns. I throw my hand up. I'm able to grab a branch. It's shaking me violently. It's a very strange sensation having another creature try and eat you, and there are few things that promote vegetarianism like that. (Laughter) Solly on the bank sees that I'm in trouble. He turns. He begins to make his way to me. The croc again continues to shake me. It goes to bite me a second time. I notice a slick of blood in the water around me that gets washed downstream. As it bites the second time, I kick. My foot goes down its throat. It spits me out. I pull myself up into the branches, and as I come out of the water, I look over my shoulder. My leg from the knee down is mangled beyond description. The bone is cracked. The meat is torn up. I make an instant decision that I'll never look at that again. As I come out of the water, Solly arrives at a deep section, a channel between us. He knows, he sees the state of my leg, he knows that between him and I there is a crocodile, and I can tell you this man doesn't slow down for one second. He comes straight into the channel. He wades in to above his waist. He gets to me. He grabs me. I'm still in a vulnerable position. He picks me and puts me on his shoulder. This is the other thing about Solly, he's freakishly strong. He turns. He walks me up the bank. He lays me down. He pulls his shirt off. He wraps it around my leg, picks me up a second time, walks me to a vehicle, and he's able to get me to medical attention. And I survive.Now \u2014 (Applause)Now I don't know how many people you know that go into a deep channel of water that they know has a crocodile in it to come and help you, but for Solly, it was as natural as breathing. And he is one amazing example of what I have experienced all over Africa. In a more collective society, we realize from the inside that our own well-being is deeply tied to the well-being of others. Danger is shared. Pain is shared. Joy is shared. Achievement is shared. Houses are shared. Food is shared. Ubuntu asks us to open our hearts and to share, and what Solly taught me that day is the essence of this value, his animated, empathetic action in every moment.Now although the root word is about people, I thought that maybe ubuntu was only about people. And then I met this young lady. Her name was Elvis. In fact, Solly gave her the name Elvis because he said she walked like she was doing the Elvis the pelvis dance. She was born with very badly deformed back legs and pelvis. She arrived at our reserve from a reserve east of us on her migratory route. When I first saw her, I thought she would be dead in a matter of days. And yet, for the next five years she returned in the winter months. And we would be so excited to be out in the bush and to come across this unusual track. It looked like an inverted bracket, and we would drop whatever we were doing and we would follow, and then we would come around the corner, and there she would be with her herd. And that outpouring of emotion from people on our safari trucks as they saw her, it was this sense of kinship. And it reminded me that even people who grow up in cities feel a natural connection with the natural world and with animals. And yet still I remained amazed that she was surviving. And then one day we came across them at this small water hole. It was sort of a hollow in the ground. And I watched as the matriarch drank, and then she turned in that  beautiful slow motion of elephants, looks like the arm in motion, and she began to make her way up the steep bank. The rest of the herd turned and began to follow. And I watched young Elvis begin to psych herself up for the hill. She got visibly \u2014 ears came forward, she had a full go of it and halfway up, her legs gave way, and she fell backwards. She attempted it a second time, and again, halfway up, she fell backwards. And on the third attempt, an amazing thing happened. Halfway up the bank, a young teenage elephant came in behind her, and he propped his trunk underneath her, and he began to shovel her up the bank. And it occurred to me that the rest of the herd was in fact looking after this young elephant. The next day I watched again as the matriarch broke a branch and she would put it in her mouth, and then she would break a second one and drop it on the ground. And a consensus developed between all of us who were guiding people in that area that that herd was in fact moving slower to accommodate that elephant.What Elvis and the herd taught me caused me to expand my definition of ubuntu, and I believe that in the cathedral of the wild, we get to see the most beautiful parts of ourselves reflected back at us. And it is not only through other people that we get to experience our humanity but through all the creatures that live on this planet. If Africa has a gift to share, it's a gift of a more collective society. And while it's true that ubuntu is an African idea, what I see is the essence of that value being invented here.Thank you.(Applause)Pat Mitchell: So Boyd, we know that you knew President Mandela from early childhood and that you heard the news as we all did today, and deeply distraught and know the tragic loss that it is to the world. But I just wondered if you wanted to share any additional thoughts, because we know that you heard that news just before coming in to do this session.Boyd Varty: Well thanks, Pat. I'm so happy because it was time for him to pass on. He was suffering. And so of course there's the mixed emotions. But I just think of so many occurrences like the time he went on the Oprah show and asked her what the show would be about. (Laughter) And she was like, \"Well, it'll be about you.\" I mean, that's just incredible humility. (Laughter)He was the father of our nation and we've got a road to walk in South Africa. And everything, they used to call it Madiba magic. You know, he used to go to a rugby match and we would win. Anywhere he went, things went well. But I think that magic will be with us, and the important thing is that we carry what he stood for. And so that's what I'm going to try and do, and that's what people all over  South Africa are trying to do.PM: And that's what you've done today. BV: Oh, thank you.PM: Thank you. BV: Thank you. Thanks very much.(Applause)", "id": 1890, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:12.539 --> 00:00:16.247\nI'm a man who's trying to live from his

--> 00:01:29.773\nand so what I have to share with you today\n\n00:01:29.773 --> 00:01:34.192\nis the simple medicine of a few campfire stories,\n\n00:01:34.192 --> 00:01:37.330\nstories about heroes of heart.\n\n00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:39.450\nNow my stories are not the stories\n\n00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:41.148\nthat you'll hear on the news,\n\n00:01:41.148 --> 00:01:44.121\nand while it's true that Africa is a harsh place,\n\n00:01:44.121 --> 00:01:46.058\nI also know it to be a place\n\n00:01:46.058 --> 00:01:50.324\nwhere people, animals and ecosystems\n\n00:01:50.324 --> 00:01:54.711\nteach us about a more interconnected world.\n\n00:01:54.711 --> 00:01:56.689\nWhen I was nine years old,\n\n00:01:56.689 --> 00:01:59.923\nPresident Mandela came to stay with my family.\n\n00:01:59.923 --> 00:02:03.347\nHe had just been released from\nhis 27 years of incarceration,\n\n00:02:03.347 --> 00:02:05.974\nand was in a period of readjustment\n\n00:02:05.974 --> 00:02:08.633\nto his sudden global icon status.\n\n00:02:08.633 --> 00:02:11.133\nMembers of the African National Congress\n\n00:02:11.133 --> 00:02:13.124\nthought that in the bush\n\n00:02:13.124 --> 00:02:15.358\nhe would have time to rest and recuperate\n\n00:02:15.358 --> 00:02:17.119\naway from the public eye,\n\n00:02:17.119 --> 00:02:20.498\nand it's true that lions tend to be\n\n00:02:20.498 --> 00:02:24.729\na very good deterrent to press and paparazzi.\n\n00:02:24.729 --> 00:02:26.858\n(Laughter)\n\n00:02:26.858 --> 00:02:29.404\nBut it was a defining time for me as a young boy.\n\n00:02:29.404 --> 00:02:31.465\nI would take him breakfast in bed,\n\n00:02:31.465 --> 00:02:33.833\nand then, in an old track suit and slippers,\n\n00:02:33.833 --> 00:02:36.438\nhe would go for a walk around the garden.\n\n00:02:36.438 --> 00:02:38.116\nAt night, I would sit with my family\n\n00:02:38.116 --> 00:02:40.617\naround the snowy, bunny-eared TV,\n\n00:02:40.617 --> 00:02:43.035\nand watch images of that same\n\n00:02:43.035 --> 00:02:44.969\nquiet man from the garden\n\n00:02:44.969 --> 00:02:48.019\nsurrounded by hundreds and thousands of people\n\n00:02:48.019 --> 00:02:51.278\nas scenes from his release were broadcast nightly.\n\n00:02:51.278 --> 00:02:53.230\nHe was bringing peace\n\n00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:56.112\nto a divided and violent South Africa,\n\n00:02:56.112 --> 00:03:01.341\none man with an unbelievable sense of his humanity.\n\n00:03:01.341 --> 00:03:04.105\nMandela said often that the gift of prison\n\n00:03:04.105 --> 00:03:07.065\nwas the ability to go within and to think,\n\n00:03:07.065 --> 00:03:08.794\nto create in himself\n\n00:03:08.794 --> 00:03:11.673\nthe things he most wanted for South Africa:\n\n00:03:11.673 --> 00:03:15.018\npeace, reconciliation, harmony.\n\n00:03:15.018 --> 00:03:17.873\nThrough this act of immense open-heartedness,\n\n00:03:17.873 --> 00:03:20.105\nhe was to become the embodiment\n\n00:03:20.105 --> 00:03:23.644\nof what in South Africa we call \"ubuntu.\"\n\n00:03:23.644 --> 00:03:26.493\nUbuntu: I am because of you.\n\n00:03:26.493 --> 00:03:29.156\nOr, people are not people\n\n00:03:29.156 --> 00:03:31.881\nwithout other people.\n\n00:03:31.881 --> 00:03:33.727\nIt's not a new idea or value\n\n00:03:33.727 --> 00:03:35.582\nbut it's one that I certainly think at these times\n\n00:03:35.582 --> 00:03:37.331\nis worth building on.\n\n00:03:37.331 --> 00:03:40.495\nIn fact, it is said that in the\ncollective consciousness of Africa,\n\n00:03:40.495 --> 00:03:42.534\nwe get to experience the deepest parts\n\n00:03:42.534 --> 00:03:43.839\nof our own humanity\n\n00:03:43.839 --> 00:03:46.623\nthrough our interactions with others.\n\n00:03:46.623 --> 00:03:48.735\nUbuntu is at play right now.\n\n00:03:48.735 --> 00:03:50.735\nYou are holding a space for me\n\n00:03:50.735 --> 00:03:54.127\nto express the deepest truth of who I am.\n\n00:03:54.127 --> 00:03:56.387\nWithout you, I'm just a guy talking to an empty room,\n\n00:03:56.387 --> 00:03:59.465\nand I spent a lot of time last week doing that,\n\n00:03:59.465 --> 00:04:02.788\nand it's not the same as this.\n\n00:04:02.788 --> 00:04:05.214\n(Laughter)\n\n00:04:05.214 --> 00:04:08.662\nIf Mandela was the national\nand international embodiment,\n\n00:04:08.662 --> 00:04:10.256\nthen the man who taught me the most\n\n00:04:10.256 --> 00:04:12.859\nabout this value personally was this man,\n\n00:04:12.859 --> 00:04:14.217\nSolly Mhlongo.\n\n00:04:14.217 --> 00:04:16.025\nSolly was born under a tree\n\n00:04:16.025 --> 00:04:18.811\n60 kilometers from where I grew up in Mozambique.\n\n00:04:18.811 --> 00:04:20.311\nHe would never have a lot of money,\n\n00:04:20.311 --> 00:04:21.733\nbut he was to be\n\n00:04:21.733 --> 00:04:24.362\none of the richest men I would ever meet.\n\n00:04:24.362 --> 00:04:27.081\nSolly grew up tending to his father's cattle.\n\n00:04:27.081 --> 00:04:31.263\nNow, I can tell you, I don't know what it is\nabout people who grow up looking after cattle,\n\n00:04:31.263 --> 00:04:34.285\nbut it makes for \u00fcber-resourcefulness.\n\n00:04:34.285 --> 00:04:36.759\nThe first job that he ever got in the safari business\n\n00:04:36.759 --> 00:04:38.975\nwas fixing the safari trucks.\n\n00:04:38.975 --> 00:04:41.629\nWhere he had learned to do that out in the bush\n\n00:04:41.629 --> 00:04:43.758\nI have no idea, but he could do it.\n\n00:04:43.758 --> 00:04:45.685\nHe then moved across into what we called\n\n00:04:45.685 --> 00:04:47.072\nthe habitat team.\n\n00:04:47.072 --> 00:04:48.958\nThese were the people on the reserve\n\n00:04:48.958 --> 00:04:51.315\nwho were responsible for its well-being.\n\n00:04:51.315 --> 00:04:53.599\nHe fixed roads, he mended wetlands,\n\n00:04:53.599 --> 00:04:55.417\nhe did some anti-poaching.\n\n00:04:55.417 --> 00:04:57.543\nAnd then one day we were out together,\n\n00:04:57.543 --> 00:05:01.074\nand he came across the tracks of where\na female leopard had walked.\n\n00:05:01.074 --> 00:05:02.848\nAnd it was an old track,\n\n00:05:02.848 --> 00:05:05.289\nbut for fun he turned and he began to follow it,\n\n00:05:05.289 --> 00:05:06.864\nand I tell you, I could tell by the speed\n\n00:05:06.864 --> 00:05:08.561\nat which he moved on those pad marks\n\n00:05:08.561 --> 00:05:12.535\nthat this man was a Ph.D.-level tracker.\n\n00:05:12.535 --> 00:05:14.309\nIf you drove past Solly\n\n00:05:14.309 --> 00:05:15.987\nsomewhere out on the reserve,\n\n00:05:15.987 --> 00:05:17.636\nyou look up in your rearview mirror,\n\n00:05:17.636 --> 00:05:19.481\nyou'd see he'd stopped the car\n\n00:05:19.481 --> 00:05:21.527\n20, 50 meters down the road\n\n00:05:21.527 --> 00:05:24.540\njust in case you need help with something.\n\n00:05:24.540 --> 00:05:27.293\nThe only accusation I ever heard leveled at him\n\n00:05:27.293 --> 00:05:28.688\nwas when one of our clients said,\n\n00:05:28.688 --> 00:05:31.905\n\"Solly, you are pathologically helpful.\"\n\n00:05:31.905 --> 00:05:34.352\n(Laughter)\n\n00:05:34.352 --> 00:05:37.243\nWhen I started professionally guiding people\n\n00:05:37.243 --> 00:05:38.900\nout into this environment,\n\n00:05:38.900 --> 00:05:40.460\nSolly was my tracker.\n\n00:05:40.460 --> 00:05:42.279\nWe worked together as a team.\n\n00:05:42.279 --> 00:05:44.305\nAnd the first guests we ever got\n\n00:05:44.305 --> 00:05:47.152\nwere a philanthropy group from your East Coast,\n\n00:05:47.152 --> 00:05:49.506\nand they said to Solly, on the side, they said,\n\n00:05:49.506 --> 00:05:52.147\n\"Before we even go out to see lions and leopards,\n\n00:05:52.147 --> 00:05:54.209\nwe want to see where you live.\"\n\n00:05:54.209 --> 00:05:55.674\nSo we took them up to his house,\n\n00:05:55.674 --> 00:05:58.546\nand this visit of the philanthropist to his house\n\n00:05:58.546 --> 00:06:01.227\ncoincided with a time when Solly's wife,\n\n00:06:01.227 --> 00:06:02.827\nwho was learning English,\n\n00:06:02.827 --> 00:06:05.011\nwas going through a phase\nwhere she would open the door\n\n00:06:05.011 --> 00:06:07.675\nby saying, \"Hello, I love you.\n\n00:06:07.675 --> 00:06:09.890\nWelcome, I love you.\" (Laughter)\n\n00:06:09.890 --> 00:06:12.439\nAnd there was something so beautifully African\n\n00:06:12.439 --> 00:06:14.284\nabout it to me, this small house\n\n00:06:14.284 --> 00:06:16.869\nwith a huge heart in it.\n\n00:06:16.869 --> 00:06:23.444\nNow on the day that Solly saved my life,\n\n00:06:23.444 --> 00:06:25.455\nhe was already my hero.\n\n00:06:25.455 --> 00:06:27.036\nIt was a hot day,\n\n00:06:27.036 --> 00:06:29.010\nand we found ourselves down by the river.\n\n00:06:29.010 --> 00:06:31.846\nBecause of the heat, I took my shoes off,\n\n00:06:31.846 --> 00:06:33.549\nand I rolled up my pants,\n\n00:06:33.549 --> 00:06:35.790\nand I walked into the water.\n\n00:06:35.790 --> 00:06:37.352\nSolly remained on the bank.\n\n00:06:37.352 --> 00:06:40.375\nThe water was clear running over sand,\n\n00:06:40.375 --> 00:06:43.689\nand we turned and we began\nto make our way upstream.\n\n00:06:43.689 --> 00:06:45.509\nAnd a few meters ahead of us,\n\n00:06:45.509 --> 00:06:48.494\nthere was a place where a tree\nhad fallen out of the bank,\n\n00:06:48.494 --> 00:06:51.265\nand its branches were touching the water,\n\n00:06:51.265 --> 00:06:52.862\nand it was shadowy.\n\n00:06:52.862 --> 00:06:55.320\nAnd if had been a horror movie,\n\n00:06:55.320 --> 00:06:57.556\npeople in the audience would have started saying,\n\n00:06:57.556 --> 00:07:01.009\n\"Don't go in there. Don't go in there.\" (Laughter)\n\n00:07:01.009 --> 00:07:04.766\nAnd of course, the crocodile was in the shadows.\n\n00:07:04.766 --> 00:07:06.881\nNow the first thing that you notice\nwhen a crocodile hits you\n\n00:07:06.881 --> 00:07:08.481\nis the ferocity of the bite.\n\n00:07:08.481 --> 00:07:10.454\nWham! It hits me by my right leg.\n\n00:07:10.454 --> 00:07:14.357\nIt pulls me. It turns. I throw my hand up.\nI'm able to grab a branch.\n\n00:07:14.357 --> 00:07:16.095\nIt's shaking me violently.\n\n00:07:16.095 --> 00:07:17.809\nIt's a very strange sensation\n\n00:07:17.809 --> 00:07:19.755\nhaving another creature try and eat you,\n\n00:07:19.755 --> 00:07:23.206\nand there are few things that\npromote vegetarianism like that.\n\n00:07:23.206 --> 00:07:24.801\n(Laughter)\n\n00:07:24.801 --> 00:07:27.086\nSolly on the bank sees that I'm in trouble.\n\n00:07:27.086 --> 00:07:29.133\nHe turns. He begins to make his way to me.\n\n00:07:29.133 --> 00:07:31.084\nThe croc again continues to shake me.\n\n00:07:31.084 --> 00:07:33.001\nIt goes to bite me a second time.\n\n00:07:33.001 --> 00:07:35.190\nI notice a slick of blood in the water around me\n\n00:07:35.190 --> 00:07:36.794\nthat gets washed downstream.\n\n00:07:36.794 --> 00:07:38.967\nAs it bites the second time, I kick.\n\n00:07:38.967 --> 00:07:41.700\nMy foot goes down its throat. It spits me out.\n\n00:07:41.700 --> 00:07:43.831\nI pull myself up into the branches,\n\n00:07:43.831 --> 00:07:47.314\nand as I come out of the water,\nI look over my shoulder.\n\n00:07:47.314 --> 00:07:49.234\nMy leg from the knee down\n\n00:07:49.234 --> 00:07:51.162\nis mangled beyond description.\n\n00:07:51.162 --> 00:07:52.557\nThe bone is cracked.\n\n00:07:52.557 --> 00:07:54.387\nThe meat is torn up.\n\n00:07:54.387 --> 00:07:58.987\nI make an instant decision that\nI'll never look at that again.\n\n00:07:58.987 --> 00:08:01.371\nAs I come out of the water,\n\n00:08:01.371 --> 00:08:03.988\nSolly arrives at a deep section,\n\n00:08:03.988 --> 00:08:05.613\na channel between us.\n\n00:08:05.613 --> 00:08:07.751\nHe knows, he sees the state of my leg,\n\n00:08:07.751 --> 00:08:09.597\nhe knows that between him and I\n\n00:08:09.597 --> 00:08:10.809\nthere is a crocodile,\n\n00:08:10.809 --> 00:08:13.301\nand I can tell you this man doesn't\nslow down for one second.\n\n00:08:13.301 --> 00:08:15.107\nHe comes straight into the channel.\n\n00:08:15.107 --> 00:08:17.042\nHe wades in to above his waist.\n\n00:08:17.042 --> 00:08:18.505\nHe gets to me. He grabs me.\n\n00:08:18.505 --> 00:08:20.177\nI'm still in a vulnerable position.\n\n00:08:20.177 --> 00:08:21.902\nHe picks me and puts me on his shoulder.\n\n00:08:21.902 --> 00:08:24.321\nThis is the other thing about Solly,\nhe's freakishly strong.\n\n00:08:24.321 --> 00:08:26.784\nHe turns. He walks me up the bank.\n\n00:08:26.784 --> 00:08:28.838\nHe lays me down. He pulls his shirt off.\n\n00:08:28.838 --> 00:08:30.622\nHe wraps it around my leg,\n\n00:08:30.622 --> 00:08:31.913\npicks me up a second time,\n\n00:08:31.913 --> 00:08:33.819\nwalks me to a vehicle,\n\n00:08:33.819 --> 00:08:37.243\nand he's able to get me to medical attention.\n\n00:08:37.243 --> 00:08:40.466\nAnd I survive.\n\n00:08:40.466 --> 00:08:44.727\nNow \u2014 (Applause)\n\n00:08:44.727 --> 00:08:47.437\nNow I don't know how many people you know\n\n00:08:47.437 --> 00:08:49.653\nthat go into a deep channel of water\n\n00:08:49.653 --> 00:08:51.913\nthat they know has a crocodile in it\n\n00:08:51.913 --> 00:08:53.256\nto come and help you,\n\n00:08:53.256 --> 00:08:56.700\nbut for Solly, it was as natural as breathing.\n\n00:08:56.700 --> 00:08:59.156\nAnd he is one amazing example\n\n00:08:59.156 --> 00:09:02.601\nof what I have experienced all over Africa.\n\n00:09:02.601 --> 00:09:04.732\nIn a more collective society,\n\n00:09:04.732 --> 00:09:07.580\nwe realize from the inside\n\n00:09:07.580 --> 00:09:10.713\nthat our own well-being is deeply tied\n\n00:09:10.713 --> 00:09:13.951\nto the well-being of others.\n\n00:09:13.951 --> 00:09:17.220\nDanger is shared. Pain is shared.\n\n00:09:17.220 --> 00:09:20.145\nJoy is shared. Achievement is shared.\n\n00:09:20.145 --> 00:09:24.675\nHouses are shared. Food is shared.\n\n00:09:24.675 --> 00:09:27.871\nUbuntu asks us to open our hearts\n\n00:09:27.871 --> 00:09:29.285\nand to share,\n\n00:09:29.285 --> 00:09:31.237\nand what Solly taught me that day\n\n00:09:31.237 --> 00:09:33.240\nis the essence of this value,\n\n00:09:33.240 --> 00:09:35.998\nhis animated, empathetic action\n\n00:09:35.998 --> 00:09:38.043\nin every moment.\n\n00:09:38.043 --> 00:09:41.550\nNow although the root word is about people,\n\n00:09:41.550 --> 00:09:44.924\nI thought that maybe ubuntu was only about people.\n\n00:09:44.924 --> 00:09:48.198\nAnd then I met this young lady.\n\n00:09:48.198 --> 00:09:49.892\nHer name was Elvis.\n\n00:09:49.892 --> 00:09:51.663\nIn fact, Solly gave her the name Elvis\n\n00:09:51.663 --> 00:09:54.520\nbecause he said she walked like she was doing\n\n00:09:54.520 --> 00:09:57.185\nthe Elvis the pelvis dance.\n\n00:09:57.185 --> 00:10:01.551\nShe was born with very badly\ndeformed back legs and pelvis.\n\n00:10:01.551 --> 00:10:03.815\nShe arrived at our reserve from a reserve\n\n00:10:03.815 --> 00:10:05.871\neast of us on her migratory route.\n\n00:10:05.871 --> 00:10:07.650\nWhen I first saw her,\n\n00:10:07.650 --> 00:10:10.118\nI thought she would be dead in a matter of days.\n\n00:10:10.118 --> 00:10:13.046\nAnd yet, for the next five years\n\n00:10:13.046 --> 00:10:15.576\nshe returned in the winter months.\n\n00:10:15.576 --> 00:10:17.953\nAnd we would be so excited to be out in the bush\n\n00:10:17.953 --> 00:10:20.349\nand to come across this unusual track.\n\n00:10:20.349 --> 00:10:21.844\nIt looked like an inverted bracket,\n\n00:10:21.844 --> 00:10:24.293\nand we would drop whatever\nwe were doing and we would follow,\n\n00:10:24.293 --> 00:10:25.964\nand then we would come around the corner,\n\n00:10:25.964 --> 00:10:28.050\nand there she would be with her herd.\n\n00:10:28.050 --> 00:10:30.945\nAnd that outpouring of emotion\n\n00:10:30.945 --> 00:10:32.659\nfrom people on our safari trucks\n\n00:10:32.659 --> 00:10:35.901\nas they saw her, it was this sense of kinship.\n\n00:10:35.901 --> 00:10:37.386\nAnd it reminded me\n\n00:10:37.386 --> 00:10:39.317\nthat even people who grow up in cities\n\n00:10:39.317 --> 00:10:42.902\nfeel a natural connection\n\n00:10:42.902 --> 00:10:45.173\nwith the natural world and with animals.\n\n00:10:45.173 --> 00:10:48.757\nAnd yet still I remained amazed\nthat she was surviving.\n\n00:10:48.757 --> 00:10:51.718\nAnd then one day we came across\nthem at this small water hole.\n\n00:10:51.718 --> 00:10:53.570\nIt was sort of a hollow in the ground.\n\n00:10:53.570 --> 00:10:56.024\nAnd I watched as the matriarch drank,\n\n00:10:56.024 --> 00:10:59.298\nand then she turned in that \nbeautiful slow motion of elephants,\n\n00:10:59.299 --> 00:11:01.068\nlooks like the arm in motion,\n\n00:11:01.068 --> 00:11:04.074\nand she began to make her way up the steep bank.\n\n00:11:04.074 --> 00:11:08.718\nThe rest of the herd turned and began to follow.\n\n00:11:08.718 --> 00:11:10.502\nAnd I watched young Elvis\n\n00:11:10.502 --> 00:11:13.858\nbegin to psych herself up for the hill.\n\n00:11:13.858 --> 00:11:17.213\nShe got visibly -- ears came forward,\n\n00:11:17.213 --> 00:11:19.362\nshe had a full go of it and halfway up,\n\n00:11:19.362 --> 00:11:21.639\nher legs gave way, and she fell backwards.\n\n00:11:21.639 --> 00:11:23.458\nShe attempted it a second time,\n\n00:11:23.458 --> 00:11:26.633\nand again, halfway up, she fell backwards.\n\n00:11:26.633 --> 00:11:28.490\nAnd on the third attempt,\n\n00:11:28.490 --> 00:11:30.947\nan amazing thing happened.\n\n00:11:30.947 --> 00:11:32.684\nHalfway up the bank,\n\n00:11:32.684 --> 00:11:35.757\na young teenage elephant came in behind her,\n\n00:11:35.757 --> 00:11:37.960\nand he propped his trunk underneath her,\n\n00:11:37.960 --> 00:11:41.297\nand he began to shovel her up the bank.\n\n00:11:41.297 --> 00:11:42.685\nAnd it occurred to me\n\n00:11:42.685 --> 00:11:44.241\nthat the rest of the herd\n\n00:11:44.241 --> 00:11:46.916\nwas in fact looking after this young elephant.\n\n00:11:46.916 --> 00:11:49.440\nThe next day I watched again\n\n00:11:49.440 --> 00:11:51.610\nas the matriarch broke a branch\n\n00:11:51.610 --> 00:11:53.451\nand she would put it in her mouth,\n\n00:11:53.451 --> 00:11:55.408\nand then she would break a second one\n\n00:11:55.408 --> 00:11:58.115\nand drop it on the ground.\n\n00:11:58.115 --> 00:12:00.487\nAnd a consensus developed between all of us\n\n00:12:00.487 --> 00:12:02.336\nwho were guiding people in that area\n\n00:12:02.336 --> 00:12:05.485\nthat that herd was in fact moving slower\n\n00:12:05.485 --> 00:12:09.541\nto accommodate that elephant.\n\n00:12:09.541 --> 00:12:11.632\nWhat Elvis and the herd taught me\n\n00:12:11.632 --> 00:12:14.956\ncaused me to expand my definition of ubuntu,\n\n00:12:14.956 --> 00:12:17.572\nand I believe that in the cathedral of the wild,\n\n00:12:17.572 --> 00:12:19.783\nwe get to see the most beautiful parts of ourselves\n\n00:12:19.783 --> 00:12:21.540\nreflected back at us.\n\n00:12:21.540 --> 00:12:25.180\nAnd it is not only through other people\n\n00:12:25.180 --> 00:12:28.100\nthat we get to experience our humanity\n\n00:12:28.100 --> 00:12:32.026\nbut through all the creatures that live on this planet.\n\n00:12:32.026 --> 00:12:34.840\nIf Africa has a gift to share,\n\n00:12:34.840 --> 00:12:38.667\nit's a gift of a more collective society.\n\n00:12:38.667 --> 00:12:42.915\nAnd while it's true that ubuntu is an African idea,\n\n00:12:42.915 --> 00:12:47.326\nwhat I see is the essence of that value\n\n00:12:47.326 --> 00:12:49.688\nbeing invented here.\n\n00:12:49.688 --> 00:12:51.803\nThank you.\n\n00:12:51.803 --> 00:12:56.656\n(Applause)\n\n00:13:16.040 --> 00:13:17.837\nPat Mitchell: So Boyd,\n\n00:13:17.837 --> 00:13:22.878\nwe know that you knew President Mandela\n\n00:13:22.878 --> 00:13:24.855\nfrom early childhood\n\n00:13:24.855 --> 00:13:27.754\nand that you heard the news as we all did today,\n\n00:13:27.754 --> 00:13:30.194\nand deeply distraught\n\n00:13:30.194 --> 00:13:34.625\nand know the tragic loss that it is to the world.\n\n00:13:34.625 --> 00:13:36.707\nBut I just wondered if you wanted\n\n00:13:36.707 --> 00:13:38.598\nto share any additional thoughts,\n\n00:13:38.613 --> 00:13:40.687\nbecause we know that you heard that news\n\n00:13:40.687 --> 00:13:44.067\njust before coming in to do this session.\n\n00:13:44.067 --> 00:13:45.763\nBoyd Varty: Well thanks, Pat.\n\n00:13:45.763 --> 00:13:48.946\nI'm so happy because it was time for him to pass on.\n\n00:13:48.946 --> 00:13:50.717\nHe was suffering.\n\n00:13:50.717 --> 00:13:53.115\nAnd so of course there's the mixed emotions.\n\n00:13:53.115 --> 00:13:55.099\nBut I just think of so many occurrences\n\n00:13:55.099 --> 00:13:57.506\nlike the time he went on the Oprah show\n\n00:13:57.506 --> 00:14:00.362\nand asked her what the show would be about.\n\n00:14:00.362 --> 00:14:01.840\n(Laughter)\n\n00:14:01.840 --> 00:14:05.138\nAnd she was like, \"Well, it'll be about you.\"\n\n00:14:05.138 --> 00:14:07.886\nI mean, that's just incredible humility.\n\n00:14:07.886 --> 00:14:11.549\n(Laughter)\n\n00:14:11.549 --> 00:14:14.711\nHe was the father of our nation\n\n00:14:14.711 --> 00:14:21.159\nand we've got a road to walk in South Africa.\n\n00:14:21.159 --> 00:14:24.569\nAnd everything, they used to call it Madiba magic.\n\n00:14:24.569 --> 00:14:27.352\nYou know, he used to go to\na rugby match and we would win.\n\n00:14:27.352 --> 00:14:30.813\nAnywhere he went, things went well.\n\n00:14:30.813 --> 00:14:33.194\nBut I think that magic will be with us,\n\n00:14:33.194 --> 00:14:36.755\nand the important thing is that we carry\n\n00:14:36.755 --> 00:14:38.280\nwhat he stood for.\n\n00:14:38.280 --> 00:14:41.767\nAnd so that's what I'm going to try and do,\n\n00:14:41.767 --> 00:14:44.659\nand that's what people all over \nSouth Africa are trying to do.\n\n00:14:44.659 --> 00:14:46.885\nPM: And that's what you've done today.\nBV: Oh, thank you.\n\n00:14:46.885 --> 00:14:50.024\nPM: Thank you.\nBV: Thank you. Thanks very much.\n\n00:14:50.024 --> 00:14:54.246\n(Applause)"}]
